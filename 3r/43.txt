the, gulf, stream, is, a, warm, and, swift, atlantic, ocean, current, that, originates, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, flows, through, the, straits, of, florida, and, up, the, eastern, coastline, of, the, united, states, then, veers, east, near, 36, n, latitude, north, carolina, and, moves, toward, northwest, europe, as, the, north, atlantic, current, the, process, of, western, intensification, causes, the, gulf, stream, to, be, a, northward, accelerating, current, off, the, east, coast, of, north, america, around, 40, 0, n, 30, 0, w, 40, 000, n, 30, 000, w, 40, 000, 30, 000, it, splits, in, two, with, the, northern, stream, the, north, atlantic, drift, crossing, to, northern, europe, and, the, southern, stream, the, canary, current, recirculating, off, west, africa, the, gulf, stream, influences, the, climate, of, the, coastal, areas, of, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, from, florida, to, southeast, virginia, near, 36, n, latitude, and, to, a, greater, degree, the, climate, of, northwest, europe, a, consensus, exists, that, the, climate, of, northwest, europe, is, warmer, than, other, areas, of, similar, latitude, at, least, partially, because, of, the, strong, north, atlantic, current, it, is, part, of, the, north, atlantic, gyre, its, presence, has, led, to, the, development, of, strong, cyclones, of, all, types, both, within, the, atmosphere, and, within, the, ocean, european, discovery, of, the, gulf, stream, dates, to, the, 1512, expedition, of, juan, ponce, de, le, n, after, which, it, became, widely, used, by, spanish, ships, sailing, from, the, caribbean, to, spain, a, summary, of, ponce, de, le, n, s, voyage, log, on, april, 22, 1513, noted, a, current, such, that, although, they, had, great, wind, they, could, not, proceed, forwards, but, backwards, and, it, seems, that, they, were, proceeding, well, at, the, end, it, was, known, that, the, current, was, more, powerful, than, the, wind, benjamin, franklin, became, interested, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, circulation, patterns, in, 1768, while, in, england, franklin, heard, a, curious, complaint, from, the, colonial, board, of, customs, why, did, it, take, british, packets, several, weeks, longer, to, reach, new, york, from, england, than, it, took, an, average, american, merchant, ship, to, reach, newport, rhode, island, despite, the, merchant, ships, leaving, from, london, and, having, to, sail, down, the, river, thames, and, then, the, length, of, the, english, channel, before, they, sailed, across, the, atlantic, while, the, packets, left, from, falmouth, in, cornwall, franklin, asked, his, cousin, timothy, folger, a, nantucket, island, whaling, captain, for, an, answer, folger, explained, that, merchant, ships, routinely, crossed, the, current, which, was, identified, by, whale, behaviour, measurement, of, the, water, s, temperature, and, changes, in, the, water, s, colour, while, the, mail, packet, captains, ran, against, it, franklin, had, folger, sketch, the, path, of, the, current, on, a, chart, of, the, atlantic, and, add, notes, on, how, to, avoid, the, current, when, sailing, from, england, to, america, franklin, then, forwarded, the, chart, to, anthony, todd, secretary, of, the, british, post, office, franklin, s, gulf, stream, chart, was, printed, in, 1769, in, london, but, it, was, mostly, ignored, by, british, sea, captains, a, copy, of, the, chart, was, printed, in, paris, circa, 1770, 1773, and, a, third, version, was, published, by, franklin, in, philadelphia, in, 1786, the, gulf, stream, proper, is, a, western, intensified, current, driven, largely, by, wind, stress, in, 1958, oceanographer, henry, stommel, noted, very, little, water, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, is, actually, in, the, stream, the, north, atlantic, current, in, contrast, is, largely, driven, by, thermohaline, circulation, its, carrying, warm, water, northeast, across, the, atlantic, makes, western, europe, and, especially, northern, europe, warmer, and, milder, than, it, otherwise, would, be, a, river, of, sea, water, called, the, atlantic, north, equatorial, current, flows, westwards, off, the, coast, of, central, africa, when, this, current, interacts, with, the, northeastern, coast, of, south, america, the, current, forks, into, two, branches, one, passes, into, the, caribbean, sea, while, a, second, the, antilles, current, flows, north, and, east, of, the, west, indies, these, two, branches, rejoin, north, of, the, straits, of, florida, the, trade, winds, blow, westwards, in, the, tropics, and, the, westerlies, blow, eastwards, at, mid, latitudes, this, wind, pattern, applies, a, stress, to, the, subtropical, ocean, surface, with, negative, curl, across, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, resulting, sverdrup, transport, is, equatorward, because, of, the, conservation, of, potential, vorticity, caused, by, the, northward, moving, winds, on, the, subtropical, ridge, s, western, periphery, and, the, increased, relative, vorticity, of, northward, moving, water, transport, is, balanced, by, a, narrow, accelerating, poleward, current, this, flows, along, the, western, boundary, of, the, ocean, basin, outweighing, the, effects, of, friction, with, the, western, boundary, current, and, is, known, as, the, labrador, current, the, conservation, of, potential, vorticity, also, causes, bends, along, the, gulf, stream, which, occasionally, break, off, as, the, gulf, stream, s, position, shifts, forming, separate, warm, and, cold, eddies, this, overall, process, known, as, western, intensification, causes, currents, on, the, western, boundary, of, an, ocean, basin, such, as, the, gulf, stream, to, be, stronger, than, those, on, the, eastern, boundary, as, a, consequence, the, resulting, gulf, stream, is, a, strong, ocean, current, it, transports, water, at, a, rate, of, 30, million, cubic, metres, per, second, 30, sverdrups, through, the, florida, straits, as, it, passes, south, of, newfoundland, this, rate, increases, to, 150, sverdrups, the, volume, of, the, gulf, stream, dwarfs, all, rivers, that, empty, into, the, atlantic, combined, which, total, 0, 6, sverdrups, it, is, weaker, however, than, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, given, the, strength, and, proximity, of, the, gulf, stream, beaches, along, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, may, be, more, vulnerable, to, large, sea, level, anomalies, which, significantly, impact, rates, of, coastal, erosion, the, gulf, stream, is, typically, 100, km, 62, mi, wide, and, 800, to, 1, 200, m, 2, 600, to, 3, 900, ft, deep, the, current, velocity, is, fastest, near, the, surface, with, the, maximum, speed, typically, about, 2, 5, m, s, 5, 6, mph, as, it, travels, north, the, warm, water, transported, by, the, gulf, stream, undergoes, evaporative, cooling, the, cooling, is, wind, driven, wind, moving, over, the, water, causes, evaporation, cooling, the, water, and, increasing, its, salinity, and, density, when, sea, ice, forms, salts, are, left, out, of, the, ice, a, process, known, as, brine, exclusion, these, two, processes, produce, water, that, is, denser, and, colder, or, more, precisely, water, that, is, still, liquid, at, a, lower, temperature, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, water, becomes, so, dense, that, it, begins, to, sink, down, through, less, salty, and, less, dense, water, the, convective, action, is, similar, to, a, lava, lamp, this, downdraft, of, cold, dense, water, becomes, a, part, of, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, a, southgoing, stream, very, little, seaweed, lies, within, the, current, although, seaweed, lies, in, clusters, to, its, east, in, april, 2018, two, studies, published, in, the, british, scientific, journal, nature, found, the, gulf, stream, to, be, at, its, weakest, for, at, least, 1, 600, years, the, gulf, stream, is, influential, on, the, climate, of, the, florida, peninsula, the, portion, off, the, florida, coast, referred, to, as, the, florida, current, maintains, an, average, water, temperature, of, at, least, 24, c, 75, f, during, the, winter, and, often, 29, c, 84, f, in, summer, and, fall, east, winds, moving, over, this, warm, water, move, warm, air, from, over, the, gulf, stream, inland, helping, to, keep, temperatures, milder, across, the, state, than, elsewhere, across, the, southeastern, united, states, during, the, winter, the, gulf, stream, carries, a, wide, variety, of, tropical, fish, and, organisms, northward, along, the, east, coast, from, florida, to, extreme, southeast, massachusetts, in, spring, and, summer, following, the, warm, waters, of, the, gulf, stream, tropical, fish, are, often, encountered, off, the, east, coast, as, they, search, for, food, including, several, species, of, batoidea, dolphin, barracuda, and, triggerfish, the, gulf, stream, s, proximity, to, nantucket, massachusetts, adds, to, its, biodiversity, because, it, is, the, northern, limit, for, southern, varieties, of, plant, life, and, the, southern, limit, for, northern, plant, species, nantucket, being, warmer, during, winter, than, the, mainland, in, winter, just, 30, miles, to, the, north, north, of, nantucket, island, along, the, new, england, coast, northward, to, the, eastern, canadian, coast, the, cold, labrador, current, is, found, the, north, atlantic, current, of, the, gulf, stream, along, with, similar, warm, air, currents, helps, keep, ireland, and, the, western, coast, of, great, britain, a, few, degrees, warmer, than, the, east, however, the, difference, is, most, dramatic, in, the, western, coastal, islands, of, scotland, a, noticeable, effect, of, the, gulf, stream, and, the, strong, westerly, winds, on, europe, occurs, along, the, norwegian, coast, northern, parts, of, norway, lie, close, to, the, arctic, zone, most, of, which, is, covered, with, ice, and, snow, in, winter, however, almost, all, of, norway, s, coast, remains, free, of, ice, and, snow, throughout, the, year, the, warming, effect, provided, by, the, gulf, stream, has, allowed, fairly, large, settlements, to, be, developed, and, maintained, on, the, coast, of, northern, norway, including, troms, the, third, largest, city, north, of, the, arctic, circle, weather, systems, warmed, by, the, gulf, stream, drift, into, northern, europe, also, warming, the, climate, behind, the, scandinavian, mountains, the, possibility, of, a, gulf, stream, collapse, has, been, covered, by, some, news, publications, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, addressed, this, issue, specifically, and, found, that, based, on, model, projections, and, theoretical, understanding, the, gulf, stream, will, not, shut, down, in, a, warming, climate, while, the, gulf, stream, is, expected, to, slow, down, as, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, weakens, it, will, not, collapse, even, if, the, amoc, were, to, collapse, nevertheless, this, slowing, down, will, have, significant, effects, including, a, rise, in, sea, level, along, the, north, american, coast, reduced, precipitation, in, the, midlatitudes, changing, patterns, of, strong, precipitation, around, europe, and, the, tropics, and, stronger, storms, in, the, north, atlantic, the, warm, water, and, temperature, contrast, along, the, edge, of, the, gulf, stream, often, increase, the, intensity, of, cyclones, tropical, or, otherwise, tropical, cyclone, generation, normally, requires, water, temperatures, in, excess, of, 26, 5, c, 79, 7, f, tropical, cyclone, formation, is, common, over, the, gulf, stream, especially, in, july, storms, travel, westward, through, the, caribbean, and, then, either, move, in, a, northward, direction, and, curve, towards, the, eastern, coast, of, the, united, states, or, stay, on, a, north, westward, track, and, enter, the, gulf, of, mexico, such, storms, have, the, potential, to, create, strong, winds, and, extensive, damage, to, the, united, states, southeast, coastal, areas, hurricane, sandy, in, 2012, was, a, recent, example, of, a, hurricane, tracking, along, the, gulf, stream, and, gaining, strength, strong, extratropical, cyclones, have, been, shown, to, deepen, significantly, along, a, shallow, frontal, zone, forced, by, the, gulf, stream, during, the, cold, season, subtropical, cyclones, also, tend, to, be, generated, near, the, gulf, stream, about, 75, of, such, systems, documented, between, 1951, and, 2000, formed, near, this, warm, water, current, with, two, annual, peaks, of, activity, occurring, during, may, and, october, cyclones, within, the, ocean, itself, form, under, the, gulf, stream, extending, as, deep, as, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, beneath, the, ocean, s, surface, the, gulf, stream, periodically, forms, rings, resulting, from, a, meander, of, the, gulf, stream, being, closed, off, from, an, alternate, route, distinctive, from, that, meander, creating, an, independent, eddy, these, eddies, have, two, types, cold, core, rings, which, rotate, cyclonically, counterclockwise, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, clockwise, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, warm, core, rings, which, rotate, anticyclonically, these, rings, have, the, capacity, to, transport, the, distinct, biological, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, their, originating, waters, to, the, new, waters, into, which, they, travel
