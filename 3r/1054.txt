stiff, presbyterian, opposition, culminating, in, the, conflicts, of, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, subsequent, scottish, support, for, charles, stuart, s, restoration, to, the, throne, of, england, resulted, in, edinburgh, s, occupation, by, oliver, cromwell, s, commonwealth, of, england, forces, the, new, model, army, in, 1650, in, the, 17th, century, edinburgh, s, boundaries, were, still, defined, by, the, city, s, defensive, town, walls, as, a, result, the, city, s, growing, population, was, accommodated, by, increasing, the, height, of, the, houses, buildings, of, 11, storeys, or, more, were, common, and, have, been, described, as, forerunners, of, the, modern, day, skyscraper, most, of, these, old, structures, were, replaced, by, the, predominantly, victorian, buildings,

its, belief, in, the, union, and, loyalty, to, the, hanoverian, monarch, george, iii, by, its, choice, of, names, for, the, streets, of, the, new, town, for, example, rose, street, and, thistle, street, and, for, the, royal, family, george, street, queen, street, hanover, street, frederick, street, and, princes, street, in, honour, of, george, s, two, sons, the, consistently, geometric, layout, of, the, plan, for, the, extension, of, edinburgh, was, the, result, of, a, major, competition, in, urban, planning, staged, by, the, town, council, in, 1766, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, the, city, was, at, the, heart, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, when, thinkers, like, david, hume, adam, smith, james, hutton, and, joseph, black, were, familiar, figures, in, its, streets, edinburgh, became, a, major, intellectual, centre, earning, it, the, nickname, athens, of, the, north, because, of, its, many, neo, classical, buildings, and, reputation, for, learning, recalling, ancient, athens, in, the, 18th, century, novel, the, expedition, of, humphry, clinker, by, tobias, smollett, one, character, describes, edinburgh, as, a, hotbed, of, genius, edinburgh, was, also, a,

and, business, classes, gradually, deserted, the, old, town, in, favour, of, the, more, elegant, one, family, residences, of, the, new, town, a, migration, that, changed, the, city, s, social, character, according, to, the, foremost, historian, of, this, development, unity, of, social, feeling, was, one, of, the, most, valuable, heritages, of, old, edinburgh, and, its, disappearance, was, widely, and, properly, lamented, despite, an, enduring, myth, to, the, contrary, edinburgh, became, an, industrial, centre, with, its, traditional, industries, of, printing, brewing, and, distilling, continuing, to, grow, in, the, 19th, century, and, joined, by, new, industries, such, as, rubber, works, engineering, works, and, others, by, 1821, edinburgh, had, been, overtaken, by, glasgow, as, scotland, s, largest, city, the, city, centre, between, princes, street, and, george, street, became, a, major, commercial, and, shopping, district, a, development, partly, stimulated, by, the, arrival, of, railways, in, the, 1840s, the, old, town, became, an, increasingly, dilapidated, overcrowded, slum, with, high, mortality, rates, improvements, carried, out, under, lord, provost, william, chambers, in, the, 1860s, began, the, transformation, of, the, area, into, the, predominantly, victorian, old, town, seen, today, more, improvements, followed, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, the, work, of, patrick, geddes, but, relative, economic, stagnation, during, the, two, world, wars, and, beyond, saw, the, old, town, deteriorate, further, before, major, slum, clearance, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, began, to, reverse, the, process, university, building, developments, which, transformed, the, george, square, and, potterrow, areas, proved, highly, controversial, since, the, 1990s, a, new, financial, district, including, the, edinburgh, international, conference, centre, has, grown, mainly, on, demolished, railway, property, to, the, west, of, the, castle, stretching, into, fountainbridge, a, run, down, 19th, century, industrial, suburb, which, has, undergone, radical, change, since, the, 1980s, with, the, demise, of, industrial, and, brewery, premises, this, ongoing, development, has, enabled, edinburgh, to, maintain, its, place, as, the, united, kingdom, s, second, largest, financial, and, administrative, centre, after, london,

while, the, early, burgh, grew, up, near, the, prominent, castle, rock, the, modern, city, is, often, said, to, be, built, on, seven, hills, namely, calton, hill, corstorphine, hill, craiglockhart, hill, braid, hill, blackford, hill, arthur, s, seat, and, the, castle, rock, giving, rise, to, allusions, to, the, seven, hills, of, rome, occupying, a, narrow, gap, between, the, firth, of, forth,

of, intensive, glaciation, 64, 65, igneous, activity, between, 350, and, 400, million, years, ago, coupled, with, faulting, led, to, the, creation, of, tough, basalt, volcanic, plugs, which, predominate, over, much, of, the, area, 64, 65, one, such, example, is, the, castle, rock, which, forced, the, advancing, ice, sheet, to, divide, sheltering, the, softer, rock, and, forming, a, 1, mi, long, 1, 6, km, tail, of, material, to, the, east, thus, creating, a, distinctive, crag, and, tail, formation, 64, 65, glacial, erosion, on, the, north, side, of, the, crag, gouged, a, deep, valley, later, filled, by, the, now, drained, nor, loch, these, features, along, with, another, hollow, on, the, rock, s, south, side, formed, an, ideal, natural, strongpoint, upon, which, edinburgh, castle, was, built, 64, 65, similarly, arthur, s, seat, is, the, remains, of, a, volcano, dating, from, the, carboniferous, period, which, was, eroded, by, a, glacier, moving, west, to, east, during, the, ice, age, 64, 65, erosive, action, such, as, plucking, and, abrasion, exposed, the, rocky, crags, to, the, west, before, leaving, a, tail, of, deposited, glacial, material, swept, to, the, east, this, process, formed, the, distinctive, salisbury, crags, a, series, of, teschenite, cliffs, between, arthur, s, seat, and, the, location, of, the, early, burgh, the, residential, areas, of, marchmont, and, bruntsfield, are, built, along, a, series, of, drumlin, ridges, south, of, the, city, centre, which, were, deposited, as, the, glacier, receded, 64, 65, other, prominent, landforms, such, as, calton, hill, and, corstorphine, hill, are, also, products, of, glacial, erosion, 64, 65, the, braid, hills, and, blackford, hill, are, a, series, of, small, summits, to, the, south, of, the, city, centre, that, command, expansive, views, looking, northwards, over, the, urban, area, to, the, firth, of, forth, 64, 65, edinburgh, is, drained, by, the, river, named, the, water, of, leith, which, rises, at, the, colzium, springs, in, the, pentland, hills, and, runs, for, 18, miles, 29, km, through, the, south, and, west, of, the, city, emptying, into, the, firth, of, forth, at, leith, the, nearest, the, river, gets, to, the, city, centre, is, at, dean, village, on, the, north, western, edge, of, the, new, town, where, a, deep, gorge, is, spanned, by, thomas, telford, s, dean, bridge, built, in, 1832, for, the, road, to, queensferry, the, water, of, leith, walkway, is, a, mixed, use, trail, that, follows, the, course, of, the, river, for, 19, 6, km, 12, 2, mi, from, balerno, to, leith, excepting, the, shoreline, of, the, firth, of, forth, edinburgh, is, encircled, by, a, green, belt, designated, in, 1957, which, stretches, from, dalmeny, in, the, west, to, prestongrange, in, the, east, with, an, average, width, of, 3, 2, km, 2, mi, the, principal, objectives, of, the, green, belt, were, to, contain, the, outward, expansion, of, the, city, and, to, prevent, the, agglomeration, of, urban, areas, expansion, affecting, the, green, belt, is, strictly, controlled, but, developments, such, as, edinburgh, airport, and, the, royal, highland, showground, at, ingliston, lie, within, the, zone, similarly, suburbs, such, as, juniper, green, and, balerno, are, situated, on, green, belt, land, one, feature, of, the, edinburgh, green, belt, is, the, inclusion, of, parcels, of, land, within, the, city, which, are, designated, green, belt, even, though, they, do, not, connect, with, the, peripheral, ring, examples, of, these, independent, wedges, of, green, belt, include, holyrood, park, and, corstorphine, hill, edinburgh, includes, former, towns, and, villages, that, retain, much, of, their, original, character, as, settlements, in, existence, before,
