as, bergota, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, an, arab, named, ki, ageng, pandan, arang, founded, a, village, and, an, islamic, school, in, this, fishing, village, on, 2, may, 1547, sultan, hadiwijaya, of, pajang, declared, pandan, arang, as, the, first, bupati, mayor, of, semarang, thus, creating, semarang, administratively, and, politically, in, 1678, sunan, amangkurat, ii, promised, to, give, control, of, semarang, to, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, as, a, part, of, a, debt, payment, in, 1682, the, semarang, state, was, founded, by, the, dutch, colonial, power, on, 5, october, 1705, after, years, of, occupations, semarang, officially, became, a, voc, city, when, susuhunan, pakubuwono, i, made, a, deal, to, give, extensive, trade, rights, to, the, voc, in, exchange, of, wiping, out, mataram, s, debt, the, voc, and, later, the, dutch, east, indies, government, established, tobacco, plantations, in, the, region, and, built, roads, and, railroads, making, semarang, an, important, colonial, trading, centre, the, historic, presence, of, a, large, indo, eurasian, community, in, the, area, of, semarang, is, also, reflected, by, the, fact, a, creole, mix, language, called, javindo, existed, there, semarang, was, handed, by, the, sultan, of, mataram, to, the, dutch, east, indies, in, 1678, the, city, was, pictured, as, a, small, settlement, with, a, pious, muslim, area, called, kauman, a, chinese, quarter, and, a, dutch, fortress, the, fortress, has, a, pentagonal, form, with, only, one, gate, in, the, south, and, five, monitoring, towers, to, protect, the, dutch, settlement, from, rebellion, actions, segregating, the, spaces, between, dutch, settlement, and, other, areas, in, fact, the, city, of, semarang, was, only, referred, to, the, dutch, quarter, while, the, other, ethnic, settlement, were, considered, as, villages, outside, the, city, boundary, the, city, known, as, de, europeesche, buurt, was, built, in, classical, european, style, with, church, located, in, the, centre, wide, boulevards, streets, and, villas, according, to, purwanto, 2005, the, urban, and, architectural, form, of, this, settlement, is, very, similar, to, the, design, principles, applied, in, many, dutch, cities, due, to, the, long, and, costly, java, war, there, was, not, much, funding, from, the, dutch, east, indies, government, and, this, affected, semarang, s, development, most, land, in, the, area, was, used, for, rice, cultivation, and, the, only, small, improvement, was, the, development, of, a, surrounding, fortress, although, less, developed, semarang, is, a, fairly, well, organized, city, in, which, urban, activities, were, concentrated, along, the, river, and, the, settlement, is, linked, to, a, market, where, different, ethnic, groups, met, to, trade, the, existence, of, the, market, in, the, later, years, become, a, primary, element, and, a, generator, of, urban, economic, growth, after, the, departure, of, herman, willem, daendels, napoleonic, governor, of, java, the, dutch, reorganized, java, into, residencies, and, semarang, became, the, seat, of, the, new, semarang, residency, in, 1817, an, important, influence, on, urban, growth, was, the, great, mail, road, project, in, the, 1847, which, connected, all, the, cities, in, the, northern, coast, of, central, and, east, java, and, positioned, semarang, as, the, trade, centre, of, agricultural, production, the, project, was, soon, followed, by, the, development, of, the, staatsspoorwegen, railway, and, the, connecting, roads, into, the,
