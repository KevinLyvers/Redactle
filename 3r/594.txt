the, most, populous, city, in, central, america, the, name, guatemala, comes, from, the, nahuatl, word, cuauht, mall, n, or, place, of, many, trees, a, derivative, of, the, k, iche, mayan, word, for, many, trees, or, perhaps, more, specifically, for, the, cuate, cuatli, tree, eysenhardtia, this, name, was, originally, used, by, the, mexica, to, refer, to, the, kaqchikel, city, of, iximche, but, was, extended, to, refer, to, the, whole, country, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, the, first, evidence, of, human, habitation, in, guatemala, dates, to, 12, 000, bc, archaeological, evidence, such, as, obsidian, arrowheads, found, in, various, parts, of, the, country, suggests, a, human, presence, as, early, as, 18, 000, bc, there, is, archaeological, proof, that, early, guatemalan,

and, sipacate, and, escuintla, on, the, central, pacific, coast, archaeologists, divide, the, pre, columbian, history, of, mesoamerica, into, the, preclassic, period, 3000, bc, to, 250, ad, the, classic, period, 250, to, 900, ad, and, the, postclassic, period, 900, to, 1500, ad, until, recently, the, preclassic, was, regarded, by, researchers, as, a, formative, period, in, which, the, peoples, typically, lived, in, huts, in, small, villages, of, farmers, with, few, permanent, buildings, this, notion, has, been, challenged, since, the, late, 20th, century, by, discoveries, of, monumental, architecture, from, that, period, such, as, the, mirador, basin, cities, of, nakb, xulnal, el, tintal, wakn, and, el, mirador, the, classic, period, of, mesoamerican, civilization, corresponds, to, the, height, of, the, maya, civilization, it, is, represented, by, countless, sites, throughout, guatemala, although, the, largest, concentration, is, in, pet, n, this, period, is, characterized, by, urbanisation, the, emergence, of, independent, city, states, and, contact, with, other, mesoamerican, cultures, this, lasted, until, approximately, 900, ad, when, the, classic, maya, civilization, collapsed, the, maya, abandoned, many, of, the, cities, of, the, central, lowlands, or, were, killed, by, a, drought, induced, famine, the, cause, of, the, collapse, is, debated, but, the, drought, theory, is, gaining, currency, supported, by, evidence, such, as, lakebeds, ancient, pollen, and, others, a, series, of, prolonged, droughts, in, what, is, otherwise, a, seasonal, desert, is, thought, to, have, decimated, the, maya, who, relied, on, regular, rainfall, to, support, their, dense, population, the, post, classic, period, is, represented, by, regional, kingdoms, such, as, the, itza, kowoj, yalain, and, kejache, in, pet, n, and, the, mam, ki, che, kackchiquel, chajoma, tz, utujil, poqomchi, q, eqchi, and, ch, orti, peoples, in, the, highlands, their, cities, preserved, many, aspects, of, maya, culture, the, maya, civilization, shares, many, features, with, other, mesoamerican, civilizations, due, to, the, high, degree, of, interaction, and, cultural, diffusion, that, characterized, the, region, advances, such, as, writing, epigraphy, and, the, calendar, did, not, originate, with, the, maya, however, their, civilization, fully, developed, them, maya, influence, can, be, detected, from, honduras, belize, guatemala, and, northern, el, salvador, to, as, far, north, as, central, mexico, more, than, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, from, the, maya, area, many, outside, influences, are, found, in, maya, art, and, architecture, which, are, thought, to, have, resulted, from, trade, and, cultural, exchange, rather, than, direct, external, conquest, after, they, arrived, in, the, new, world, the, spanish, started, several, expeditions, to, guatemala, beginning, in, 1519, before, long, spanish, contact, resulted, in, an, epidemic, that, devastated,

received, two, altenses, emissaries, who, told, him, that, their, soldiers, were, not, going, to, fight, his, forces, because, that, would, lead, to, a, native, revolt, much, like, that, of, 1840, their, only, request, from, carrera, was, to, keep, the, natives, under, control, the, altenses, did, not, comply, and, led, by, guzm, n, and, his, forces, they, started, chasing, carrera, the, caudillo, hid, helped, by, his, native, allies, and, remained, under, their, protection, when, the, forces, of, miguel, garcia, granados, arrived, from, guatemala, city, looking, for, him, on,

population, and, that, he, assured, paredes, that, he, would, keep, them, appeased, when, the, emissary, returned, to, guatemala, city, he, told, the, president, everything, carrera, said, and, added, that, the, native, forces, were, formidable, guzm, n, went, to, antigua, to, meet, with, another, group, of, paredes, emissaries, they, agreed, that, los, altos, would, rejoin, guatemala, and, that, the, latter, would, help, guzm, n, defeat, his, enemy, and, also, build, a, port, on, the, pacific, ocean, guzm, n, was, sure, of, victory, this, time, but, his, plan, evaporated, when, in, his,

anjobal, and, mam, leaders, to, keep, the, region, under, control, on, his, way, out, yrigoyen, murmured, to, a, friend, now, he, is, the, king, of, the, indians, indeed, guzm, n, then, left, for,

to, 1848, he, brought, the, country, back, from, excessive, conservatism, to, a, moderate, regime, and, with, the, advice, of, juan, jos, de, aycinena, y, pi, ol, and, pedro, de, aycinena, restored, relations, with, the, church, in, rome, with, a, concordat, ratified, in, 1854, after, carrera, returned, from, exile, in, 1849, the, president, of, el, salvador, doroteo, vasconcelos, granted, asylum, to, the, guatemalan, liberals, who, harassed, the, guatemalan, government, in, several, different, ways, jos, francisco, barrundia, established, a, liberal, newspaper, for, that, specific,

impatient, at, the, slow, progress, of, the, war, with, guatemala, and, decided, to, plan, an, open, attack, under, that, circumstance, the, salvadorean, head, of, state, started, a, campaign, against, the, conservative, guatemalan, regime, inviting, honduras, and, nicaragua, to, participate, in, the, alliance, only, the, honduran, government, led, by, juan, lindo, accepted, in, 1851,

with, the, power, to, choose, his, successor, he, held, that, position, until, he, died, on, 14, april, 1865, while, he, pursued, some, measures, to, set, up, a, foundation, for, economic, prosperity, to, please, the, conservative, landowners, military, challenges, at, home, and, a, three, year, war, with, honduras, el, salvador, and, nicaragua, dominated, his, presidency, his, rivalry, with, gerardo, barrios, president, of, el, salvador, resulted, in, open, war, in, 1863, at, coatepeque, the, guatemalans, suffered, a, severe, defeat, which, was, followed, by, a, truce, honduras, joined, with, el, salvador, and, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, with, guatemala, the, contest, was, finally, settled, in, favor, of, carrera, who, besieged, and, occupied, san, salvador, and, dominated, honduras, and, nicaragua, he, continued, to, act, in, concert, with, the, clerical, party, and, tried, to, maintain, friendly, relations, with, european, governments, before, he, died, carrera,

worse, intentions, was, in, charge, of, the, country, centralizing, all, powers, in, vicente, cerna, ambitious, military, man, who, not, happy, with, the, general, rank, had, promoted, himself, to, the, army, marshall, rank, even, though, that, rank, did, not, exist, and, it, does, not, exist, in, the, guatemalan, military, the, marshall, called, himself, president, of, the, republic, but, in, reality, he, was, the, foreman, of, oppressed, and, savaged, people, cowardly, enough, that, they, had, not, dared, to, tell, the, dictator, to, leave, threatening, him, with, a, revolution, the, state, and, church, were, a, single, unit, and, the, conservative, r, gime, was, strongly, allied, to, the, power, of, regular, clergy, of, the, catholic, church, who, were, then, among, the, largest, landowners, in, guatemala, the, tight, relationship, between, church, and, state, had, been, ratified, by, the, concordat, of, 1852, which, was, the, law, until, cerna, was, deposed, in, 1871, even, liberal, generals, like, serapio, cruz, realized, that, rafael, carrera, s, political, and, military, presence, made, him, practically, invincible, thus, the, generals, fought, under, his, command, and, waited, for, a, long, time, until, carrera, s, death, before, beginning, their, revolt, against, the, tamer, cerna, during, cerna, s, presidency, liberal, party, members, were, prosecuted, and,
