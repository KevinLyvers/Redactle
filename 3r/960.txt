also, among, the, fastest, developing, cities, in, southeast, asia, maynil, the, filipino, name, for, the, city, comes, from, the, phrase, may, nil, meaning, where, indigo, is, found, nil, is, derived, from, the, sanskrit, word, n, la, which, refers, to, indigo, dye, and, by, extension, to, several, plant, species, from, which, this, natural, dye, can, be, extracted, the, name, maynil, was, probably, bestowed, because, of, the, indigo, yielding, plants, that, grew, in, the, area, surrounding, the, settlement, rather, than, because, it, was, known, as, a, settlement, that, traded, in, indigo, dye, indigo, dye, extraction, only, became, an, important, economic, activity, in, the, area, in, the, 18th, century, several, hundred, years, after, maynila, settlement, was, founded, and, named, maynil, eventually, underwent, a, process, of, hispanicization, and, adopted, the, spanish, name, manila, according, to, an, antiquated, inaccurate, and, now, debunked, etymological, theory, the, city, s, name, originated, from, the, word, may, nilad, meaning, where, nilad, is, found, there, are, two, versions, of, this, false, etymology, one, popular, incorrect, notion, is, that, the, old, word, nilad, refers, to, the, water, hyacinth, eichhornia, crassipes, that, grows, on, the, banks, of, the, pasig, river, this, plant, species, however, was, only, recently, introduced, into, the, philippines, from, south, america, and, therefore, could, not, be, the, source, of, the, toponym, for, old, manila, another, incorrect, etymology, arose, from, the, observation, that, in, tagalog, nil, d, or, nil, r, refers, to, a, shrub, like, tree, scyphiphora, hydrophyllacea, formerly, ixora, manila, blanco, that, grows, in, or, near, mangrove, swamps, linguistic, analysis, however, shows, the, word, maynil, is, unlikely, to, have, developed, from, this, term, it, is, unlikely, native, tagalog, speakers, would, completely, drop, the, final, consonant, d, in, nilad, to, arrive, at, the, present, form, maynil, as, an, example, nearby, bacoor, retains, the, final, consonant, of, the, old, tagalog, word, bako, d, elevated, piece, of, land, even, in, old, spanish, renderings, of, the, placename, e, g, vacol, bacor, historians, ambeth, ocampo, and, joseph, baumgartner, have, shown, in, every, early, document, that, the, place, name, maynil, was, always, written, without, a, final, d, this, documentation, shows, that, the, may, nilad, etymology, is, spurious, originally, the, mistaken, identification, of, nilad, as, the, source, of, the, toponym, probably, originated, in, an, 1887, essay, by, trinidad, pardo, de, tavera, in, which, he, mistakenly, used, the, word, nila, to, refer, both, to, indigofera, tinctoria, true, indigo, and, to, ixora, manila, which, is, actually, nil, d, in, tagalog, early, 20th, century, writings, such, as, those, of, julio, nakpil, and, blair, and, robertson, repeated, the, claim, today, this, erroneous, etymology, continues, to, be, perpetuated, through, casual, repetition, in, literature, and, in, popular, use, examples, of, popular, adoption, of, this, mistaken, etymology, include, the, name, of, a, local, utility, company, maynilad, water, services, and, the, name, of, an, underpass, close, to, manila, city, hall, lagusnilad, meaning, nilad, pass, on, the, other, hand, in, a, rather, first, account, of, importance, on, the, philippine, flora, that, appeared, in, 1704, as, an, appendix, to, ray, s, historia, plantarum, which, is, the, herbarium, aliarumque, stirpium, in, insula, luzone, philippinarum, primaria, nascentium, by, fr, georg, josef, kamel, he, mentioned, that, nilad, arbor, mediocris, rarissimi, recta, ligno, folido, et, compacto, ut, molavin, ubi, abundant, mangle, locum, vocant, manglar, ita, ubi, nilad, maynilad, unde, corrupte, manila, nilad, is, an, average, tree, very, rare, straight, leafy, wood, and, compact, like, molavin, where, mangle, abounds, the, place, is, called, manglar, so, where, nilad, abounds, maynilad, whence, the, corruption, manila, making, this, an, earlier, account, of, the, change, in, this, name, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, life, around, present, day,
