km, 2, 120, 777, sq, mi, it, forms, one, of, the, largest, river, basins, in, the, indian, subcontinent, with, only, the, ganga, and, indus, rivers, having, a, larger, drainage, basin, in, terms, of, length, catchment, area, and, discharge, the, godavari, is, the, largest, in, peninsular, india, and, had, been, dubbed, as, the, dakshina, ganga, southern, ganges, the, river, has, been, revered, in, hindu, scriptures, for, many, millennia, and, continues, to, harbour, and, nourish, a, rich, cultural, heritage, in, the, past, few, decades, the, river, has, been, barricaded, by, several, barrages, and, dams, keeping, a, head, of, water, depth, which, lowers, evaporation, its, broad, river, delta, houses, 729, persons, km, 2, nearly, twice, the, indian, average, population, density, and, has, a, substantial, risk, of, flooding, which, in, lower, parts, would, be, exacerbated, if, the, global, sea, level, were, to, rise, the, godavari, originates, in, the, western, ghats, of, central, india, near, nashik, in, maharashtra, 80, km, 50, mi, from, the, arabian, sea, it, flows, for, 1, 465, km, 910, mi, first, eastwards, across, the, deccan, plateau, then, turns, southeast, entering, the, eluru, district, and, alluri, sitharama, raju, district, of, andhra, pradesh, until, it, splits, into, two, distributaries, that, widen, into, a, large, river, delta, at, dhavaleshwaram, barrage, in, rajamahendravaram, and, then, flows, into, the, bay, of, bengal, the, godavari, river, has, a, coverage, area, of, 312, 812, km, 2, 120, 777, sq, mi, which, is, nearly, one, tenth, of, the, area, of, india, and, is, equivalent, to, the, area, of, the, united, kingdom, and, republic, of, ireland, put, together, the, river, basin, is, considered, to, be, divided, into, 3, sections, these, put, together, account, for, 24, 2, of, the, total, basin, area, the, rivers, annual, average, water, inflows, are, nearly, 110, billion, cubic, metres, nearly, 50, of, the, water, availability, is, being, harnessed, the, water, allocation, from, the, river, among, the, riparian, states, are, governed, by, the, godavari, water, disputes, tribunal, the, river, has, highest, flood, flows, in, india, and, experienced, recorded, flood, of, 3, 6, million, cusecs, in, the, year, 1986, and, annual, flood, of, 1, 0, million, cusecs, is, normal, the, river, originates, in, maharashtra, state, and, has, an, extensive, course, the, upper, basin, origin, to, its, confluence, with, manjira, of, which, lies, entirely, within, the, state, cumulatively, draining, an, area, as, large, as, 152, 199, km, 2, 58, 764, sq, mi, about, half, the, area, of, maharashtra, within, nashik, district, the, river, assumes, a, north, easterly, course, until, it, flows, into, the, gangapur, reservoir, created, by, a, dam, of, the, same, name, the, reservoir, along, with, the, kashypi, dam, provides, potable, water, to, nashik, one, of, the, largest, cities, located, on, its, banks, the, river, as, it, emerges, through, the, dam, some, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, upstream, from, nashik, flows, on, a, rocky, bed, undulated, by, a, series, of, chasms, and, rocky, ledges, resulting, in, the, formation, of, two, significant, waterfalls, the, gangapur, and, the, someshwar, waterfalls, the, latter, located, at, someshwar, is, more, popularly, known, as, the, dudhsagar, waterfall, about, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, east, of, gangapur, the, river, passes, the, town, of, nashik, where, it, collects, its, effluents, in, the, form, of, the, river, nasardi, on, its, right, bank, about, 0, 5, km, 0, 31, mi, south, of, nashik, the, river, bends, sharply, to, the, east, washing, the, base, of, a, high, cliff, formerly, the, site, of, a, mughal, fort, but, which, is, now, being, eroded, away, by, the, action, of, floods, about, 25, km, 16, mi, below, nashik, is, the, confluence, of, the, godavari, and, one, of, its, tributaries, the, darna, the, stream, occupies, for, nine, months, in, the, year, a, small, space, in, a, wide, and, gravelly, bed, the, greyish, banks, being, 4, to, 6, m, 13, to, 20, ft, high, topped, with, a, deep, layer, of, black, soil, a, few, kilometres, after, its, meeting, with, the, darna, the, godavari, swerves, to, the, north, east, before, the, banganga, from, the, north, west, meets, it, on, the, left, the, course, of, the, main, stream, then, tends, more, decidedly, south, at, nandur, madhmeshwar, the, kadva, a, second, large, affluent, brings, considerable, increase, to, the, waters, of, the, godavari, the, river, begins, its, southeasterly, course, characteristic, of, rivers, of, the, deccan, plateau, the, river, exits, the, niphad, taluka, of, nashik, and, enters, the, kopargaon, taluka, ahmednagar, district, within, ahmednagar, district, the, river, quickly, completes, its, short, course, flowing, alongside, the, town, of, kopargaon, and, reaching, puntamba, beyond, this, the, river, serves, as, a, natural, boundary, between, the, following, districts, the, river, beyond, near, the, village, sonpeth, flows, into, parbhani, in, parbhani, district, the, river, flows, through, gangakhed, taluka, as, mentioned, above, the, godavari, is, also, called, dakshinganga, so, the, city, is, called, as, gangakhed, meaning, a, village, on, the, bank, of, ganga, as, per, hindu, rituals, this, place, is, considered, quite, important, for, after, death, peace, to, flow, ashes, into, the, river, its, course, is, relatively, non, significant, except, for, receiving, two, smaller, streams, indrayani, and, masuli, merging, at, its, left, and, right, banks, respectively, within, the, last, taluka, of, the, district, parbhani, purna, the, river, drains, a, major, tributary, of, the, same, name, purna, it, then, exits, into, the, neighbouring, district, of, nanded, where, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, before, reaching, the, town, nanded, it, is, impounded, by, the, vishnupuri, dam, and, thus, with, it, bringing, asia, s, largest, lift, irrigation, projects, to, life, a, little, downstream, from, nanded, the, river, receives, asna, a, small, stream, on, its, left, bank, it, then, runs, into, the, controversial, babli, project, soon, ends, its, course, within, maharashtra, albeit, temporarily, at, its, merger, with, a, major, tributary, manjira, the, river, after, flowing, into, telangana, re, emerges, to, run, as, a, state, boundary, separating, the, mancherial, telangana, from, gadchiroli, maharashtra, at, the, state, border, it, runs, between, sironcha, and, somnoor, sangam, receiving, one, tributary, at, each, of, those, nodal, points, the, pranhita, and, subsequently, the, indravati, godavari, enters, into, telangana, in, nizamabad, district, at, kandakurthy, where, manjira, haridra, rivers, joins, godavari, and, forms, triveni, sangamam, the, river, flows, along, the, border, between, nirmal, and, mancherial, districts, in, the, north, and, nizamabad, jagtial, peddapalli, districts, to, its, south, about, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, after, entering, telangana, it, merges, with, the, back, waters, of, the, sriram, sagar, dam, the, river, after, emerging, through, the, dam, gates, enjoys, a, wide, river, bed, often, splitting, to, encase, sandy, islands, the, river, receives, a, minor, but, significant, tributary, kadam, river, it, then, emerges, at, its, eastern, side, to, act, as, a, state, border, with, maharashtra, only, to, later, enter, into, bhadradri, kothagudem, district, in, this, district, the, river, flows, through, an, important, hindu, pilgrimage, town, bhadrachalam, the, river, further, swells, after, receiving, a, minor, tributary, kinnerasani, river, and, exits, into, andhra, pradesh, within, the, state, of, andhra, pradesh, the, river, flows, through, hilly, terrain, of, the, eastern, ghats, known, as, the, papi, hills, which, explains, the, narrowing, of, its, bed, as, it, flows, through, a, gorge, for, a, few, km, only, to, re, widen, at, polavaram, the, deepest, bed, level, of, a, plunge, pool, in, godavari, river, located, 36, km, upstream, of, polavaram, dam, is, at, 45, meters, below, the, sea, level, before, crossing, the, papi, hills, it, receives, its, last, major, tributary, sabari, river, on, its, left, bank, the, river, upon, reaching, the, plains, begins, to, widen, out, until, it, reaches, rajamahendravaram, arma, konda, 1, 680, m, 5, 510, ft, is, the, highest, peak, in, the, godavari, river, basin, as, well, as, in, eastern, ghats, dowleswaram, barrage, was, constructed, across, the, river, in, rajamahendravaram, at, rajamahendravaram, the, godavari, splits, into, two, large, branches, which, are, called, gautami, gautami, godavari, and, vasishta, godavari, and, five, smaller, branches, similarly, the, vasishta, splits, into, two, branches, named, vasishta, and, vainateya, these, four, branches, which, join, the, bay, of, bengal, at, different, places, form, a, delta, of, length, 170, km, 110, mi, along, the, coast, of, the, bay, of, bengal, and, is, called, the, konaseema, region, this, delta, along, with, the, delta, of, the, krishna, river, is, called, the, rice, granary, of, south, india, the, gautami, which, is, the, largest, branch, of, the, whole, passes, along, yanam, enclave, of, union, territory, of, puducherry, and, empties, itself, into, sea, at, point, godavery, in, fact, yanam, is, bounded, on, south, by, gautami, branch, and, the, coringa, river, originates, at, yanam, which, merges, into, the, sea, near, coringa, village, in, andhra, pradesh, mean, annual, minimum, and, maximum, discharge, q, m, 3, s, at, rajahmundry, period, from, 1998, 01, 01, to, 2023, 12, 31, the, major, left, bank, tributaries, include, the, purna, pranhita, indravati, and, sabari, river, covering, nearly, 59, 7, of, the, total, catchment, area, of, the, basin, the, right, bank, tributaries, pravara, manjira, and, manair, contribute, 16, 1, of, the, basin, the, pranhita, river, is, the, largest, tributary, of, the, godavari, river, covering, about, 34, of, its, drainage, basin, though, the, river, proper, flows, only, for, 113, km, 70, mi, by, virtue, of, its, extensive, tributaries, wardha, wainganga, penganga, the, sub, basin, drains, all, of, vidharba, region, as, well, as, the, southern, slopes, of, the, satpura, ranges, indravati, is, the, 2nd, largest, tributary, known, as, the, lifeline, of, the, kalahandi, nabarangapur, of, odisha, and, bastar, district, of, chhattisgarh, due, to, their, enormous, sub, basins, both, indravati, and, pranhita, are, considered, rivers, in, their, own, right,

godavari, other, than, these, seven, principal, tributaries, it, has, many, smaller, but, significant, ones, draining, into, it, indravati, river, floodwaters, overflow, into, the, jouranala, which, is, part, of, sabari, basin, a, barrage, at, 19, 7, 19, n, 82, 14, 9, e, 19, 12194, n, 82, 23583, e, 19, 12194, 82, 23583, jouranala, barrage, is, constructed, across, the, indravati, river, to, divert, indravati, water, in, to, sabari, river, for, enhanced, hydropower, generation, before, merging, into, the, bay, of, bengal, the, godavari, has, seven, mouths, in, total, and, is, considered, sacred, by, local, hindus, as, per, their, traditional, belief, the, holy, waters, of, the, godavari, are, said, to, have, been, brought, from, the, head, of, shiva, by, the, rishi, gautama, and, the, seven, branches, by, which, it, is, traditionally, supposed, to, have, reached, the, sea, are, said, have, been, made, by, seven, great, rishis, known, as, sapta, rishis, thus, they, are, named, after, these, seven, great, rishis, and, are, named, as, tulyabh, ga, tulya, or, ka, yapa, treya, atri, gautam, gautama, jamadagni, now, replaced, by, v, ddhagautam, i, e, old, gautami, bhardv, ja, bharadvaja, kau, ika, visvamitra, and, va, i, ha, vasishtha, so, bathing, in, these, mouths, are, considered, an, act, of, great, religious, efficacy, by, native, hindus, these, mouths, are, remembered, by, a, sanskrit, sloka, as, follow, tuly, trey, bharadv, ja, gautam, v, ddhagautam, kau, ik, ca, va, i, haaca, tath, s, gara, gata, godavari, becomes, tulya, treyi, bharadv, ja, gautam, v, ddhagautam, kau, ik, and, va, i, haa, and, then, passes, into, sea, together, they, are, referred, as, sapta, godavari, and, the, godavari, river, before, splitting, is, referred, as, akhanda, godavari, however, there, exists, another, eight, mouth, named, as, vainateyam, which, is, not, one, of, these, traditional, seven, mouths, and, is, supposed, to, have, been, created, by, a, rishi, of, that, name, who, stole, a, part, of, vasisththa, branch, godavari, was, frequently, referred, as, ganga, or, ganges, by, ancient, indian, writings, however, the, original, branches, of, kau, ika, bhardwaja, and, jamadagni, does, not, exist, any, longer, and, the, pilgrims, bathe, in, the, sea, at, the, spots, where, they, are, supposed, to, have, been, the, traditional, bharadw, ja, mouth, is, in, tirth, lamondi, now, bordering, savithri, nagar, of, yanam, and, before, a, hamlet, of, guttenadivi, and, the, traditional, kau, ika, mouth, is, located, at, rameswaram, a, hamlet, of, samathakurru, village, in, allavaram, mandal, of, konaseema, district, traditional, mouth, of, jamadagni, is, not, known, and, people, instead, take, bath, in, the, vriddha, gautami, branch, at, kundaleswaram, village, in, katrenikona, mandal, of, konaseema, district, there, is, a, local, legend, saying, the, injaram, and, patha, old, injaram, now, on, the, other, bank, of, gautami, river, within, island, polavalam, mandal, of, konaseema, district, were, split, by, godavari, river, thus, the, godavari, passing, between, these, two, now, referred, as, gautami, and, the, old, passage, being, referred, as, vriddha, gautami, in, early, british, records, the, injaram, paragana, district, was, counted, along, with, muramalla, village, now, located, on, the, other, side, of, gautami, within, island, polavalam, mandal, and, said, to, have, comprised, 22, villages, traditional, the, river, is, sacred, to, hindus, and, has, several, places, on, its, banks, that, have, been, places, of, pilgrimage, for, thousands, of, years, amongst, the, huge, numbers, of, people, who, have, bathed, in, her, waters, as, a, rite, of, cleansing, are, said, to, have, been, the, deity, baladeva, 5000, years, ago, and, the, saint, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, 500, years, ago, every, twelve, years, the, pushkaram, fair, is, held, on, the, banks, of, the, river, a, legend, has, it, that, the, sage, gautama, lived, in, the, brahmagiri, hills, at, tryambakeshwar, with, his, wife, ahalya, the, couple, lived, the, rest, of, their, lives, in, the, then, village, called, govuru, now, known, as, kovvur, cow, since, british, rule, ahalya, lived, in, a, nearby, place, called, thagami, now, thogummi, the, sage, as, a, reason, for, the, practice, of, annadanam, giving, away, food, to, the, needy, started, cultivating, rice, crops, and, other, crops, once, the, god, ganesha, on, the, wish, of, the, sages, sent, a, miraculous, cow, mayadhenu, which, resembled, a, normal, cow, it, entered, the, sage, s, abode, and, started, spoiling, the, rice, while, he, was, meditating, since, cattle, is, sacred, to, hindus, and, treated, with, respect, he, put, the, darbha, grass, on, the, cow, but, to, his, surprise, it, fell, dead, seeing, what, happened, before, their, eyes, the, sages, and, their, wives, cried, out, we, thought, that, gautama, maharishi, is, a, righteous, man, but, he, committed, bovicide, killing, of, a, cow, or, cattle, the, sage, wished, to, atone, for, this, grievous, sin, therefore, he, went, to, nashik, and, observed, tapas, penance, to, propitiate, tryambakeshvara, a, manifestation, of, the, god, shiva, on, the, advice, of, the, sages, praying, for, atonement, and, asking, him, to, make, the, ganges, flow, over, the, cow, shiva, was, pleased, with, the, sage, and, diverted, the, ganges, which, washed, away, the, cow, and, gave, rise, to, the, godavari, river, in, nashik, the, water, stream, flowed, past, kovvur, and, ultimately, merged, with, the, bay, of, bengal, in, olden, days, a, pilgrimage, named, as, sapta, s, gara, y, tra, was, made, by, those, desirous, of, offspring, along, the, banks, of, the, holy, waters, from, the, seven, mouths, it, starts, with, holy, bathing, at, tulyabhaga, river, at, chollangi, village, on, amavasya, during, krishna, paksha, of, pushya, month, as, per, hindu, calendar, that, day, is, locally, referred, as, chollangi, amavasya, that, place, where, the, river, branch, merges, with, sea, is, referred, as, tulya, s, gara, sangamam, secondly, they, take, bath, in, coringa, village, in, the, coringa, river, which, is, considered, as, atreya, branch, of, godavari, and, the, holy, bathing, place, is, called, as, atreya, s, gara, sangamam, after, bathing, at, different, banks, of, the, other, branches, the, pilgrimage, ends, by, bathing, near, narsapuram, or, antarvedi, sites, of, pilgrimage, include, the, following, are, few, other, wildlife, sanctuaries, located, in, the, river, basin, duduma, waterfalls, is, 175, metres, 574, ft, high, and, one, of, the, highest, waterfalls, in, southern, india, it, is, located, on, the, sileru, river, which, forms, boundary, between, andhra, pradesh, and, odisha, states, the, following, are, a, few, other, waterfalls, located, in, the, river, basin, there, are, 4, bridges, spanning, the, river, between, east, godavari, and, west, godavari, districts, details, the, main, godavari, river, up, to, the, confluence, with, pranhita, tributary, is, dammed, fully, to, utilize, the, available, water, for, irrigation, however, its, main, tributaries, pranhita, indravati, and, sabari, which, join, in, the, lower, reaches, of, the, basin, carry, three, times, more, water, compared, to, main, godavari, in, 2015, the, water, surplus, godavari, river, is, linked, to, the, water, deficit, krishna, river, by, commissioning, the, polavaram, right, bank, canal, with, the, help, of, pattiseema, lift, scheme, to, augment, water, availability, to, the, prakasam, barrage, located, in, andhra, pradesh, more, dams, are, constructed, in, the, godavari, river, basin, than, in, any, other, river, basin, of, india, the, following, are, the, few, dams, located, in, the, river, basin, the, godavari, river, in, maharashtra, is, one, of, the, rivers, whose, water, energy, is, least, harnessed, for, generating, hydro, electricity, the, 600, mw, capacity, upper, indravati, hydro, power, station, is, the, biggest, hydro, power, station, which, diverts, godavari, river, water, to, the, mahanadi, river, basin, the, following, is, the, list, of, hydro, electric, power, stations, excluding, small, and, medium, installations, nearly, 2490, tmcft, of, water, has, gone, waste, to, the, sea, on, average, in, a, water, year, from, 1, june, 2003, to, 31, may, 2022, 19, years, the, yearly, water, unutilized, is, given, below, there, is, least, possibility, to, construct, new, reservoirs, in, the, river, basin, area, due, to, land, submergence, and, displacement, of, population, however, a, freshwater, coastal, reservoir, located, on, the, adjacent, sea, with, adequate, storage, capacity, nearly, 29, billion, m, 3, is, economically, feasible, to, harness, the, remaining, unutilized, water, in, the, river, the, primary, and, initial, catchment, of, the, godavari, drainage, basin, is, largely, represented, by, the, basalt, of, the, deccan, volcanic, province, 50, of, the, total, basin, area, this, is, followed, by, the, precambrian, granites, and, gneisses, of, the, eastern, dharwar, craton, sandstones, shales, and, limestones, of, the, gondwana, supergroup, various, sedimentary, units, of, cuddapah, and, vindhyan, basins, charnockites, and, khondalites, of, the, proterozoic, eastern, ghats, mobile, belt, and, the, sandstones, of, the, rajahmundry, formation, the, godavari, river, carries, the, largest, sediment, load, among, the, peninsular, rivers, and, the, majority, of, the, mass, transfer, in, godavari, occurs, during, the, monsoon, mineral, magnetic, studies, of, the, godavari, river, sediments, suggest, that, the, floodplains, in, the, entire, stretch, of, the, river, are, characterized, by, a, deccan, basalt, source, the, bed, loads, on, the, other, hand, are, of, sourced, from, local, bedrock, influx, of, deccan, source, in, the, godavari, river, up, to, the, delta, regions, and, possibly, in, the, bay, of, bengal, off, the, godavari, therefore, can, be, related, to, the, intensive, chemical, weathering, in, the, deccan, basalts, abrupt, increase, in, 13, c, values, and, decrease, in, toc, content, accompanied, with, a, significant, increase, in, ferrimagnetic, mineral, concentration, in, bay, of, bengal, sediments, from, 3, 2, to, 3, 1, cal, ka, bp, reflected, a, shift, of, organic, carbon, and, sediment, source, and, a, severe, decline, in, vegetation, coverage, such, phenomena, indicate, intensified, deforestation, and, soil, rock, erosion, in, the, deccan, plateau, producing, higher, ferrimagnetic, mineral, inputs, which, is, in, agreement, with, significant, expansion, of, agricultural, activities, in, the, deccan, chalcolithic, cultural, period, the, godavari, river, basin, is, endowed, with, rich, mineral, deposits, such, as, oil, and, gas, coal, iron, limestone, manganese, copper, bauxite, granite, laterite, and, others, the, following, are, the, few, noted, deposits, the, frequent, drying, up, of, the, godavari, river, in, the, drier, months, has, been, a, matter, of, great, concern, indiscriminate, damming, along, the, river, has, been, cited, as, an, obvious, reason, within, maharashtra, sugarcane, irrigation, has, been, blamed, as, one, of, the, foremost, causes, in, 2013, the, river, was, at, its, all, time, low, in, the, nizamabad, district, of, telangana, this, had, hit, the, growth, of, fish, making, the, life, of, fishermen, miserable, the, water, level, was, so, low, that, people, could, easily, walk, into, the, middle, of, the, river, shortage, in, rainfall, and, closure, of, the, controversial, babli, project, gates, in, maharashtra, was, thought, to, have, affected, the, water, flow, in, the, river, and, water, availability, to, the, sriram, sagar, project, except, during, above, 20, excess, monsoon, i, e, one, out, of, four, years, years, a, study, has, found, that, the, delta, is, at, a, greater, risk, as, the, rate, of, sediment, aggradation, raising, the, level, of, the, delta, through, sediment, deposition, no, longer, exceeds, relative, sea, level, rise, it, further, states, that, the, suspended,
