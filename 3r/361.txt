the, alps, l, p, s, are, one, of, the, highest, and, most, extensive, mountain, ranges, in, europe, stretching, approximately, 1, 200, km, 750, mi, across, eight, alpine, countries, from, west, to, east, monaco, france, switzerland, italy, liechtenstein, germany, austria, and, slovenia, the, alpine, arch, extends, from, nice, on, the, western, mediterranean, to, trieste, on, the, adriatic, and, vienna, at, the, beginning, of, the, pannonian, basin, the, mountains, were, formed, over, tens, of, millions, of, years, as, the, african, and, eurasian, tectonic, plates, collided, extreme, shortening, caused, by, the, event, resulted, in, marine, sedimentary, rocks, rising, by, thrusting, and, folding, into, high, mountain, peaks, such, as, mont, blanc, and, the, matterhorn, mont, blanc, spans, the, french, italian, border, and, at, 4, 809, m, 15, 778, ft, is, the, highest, mountain, in, the, alps, the, alpine, region, area, contains, 128, peaks, higher, than, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, the, altitude, and, size, of, the, range, affect, the, climate, in, europe, in, the, mountains, precipitation, levels, vary, greatly, and, climatic, conditions, consist, of, distinct, zones, wildlife, such, as, ibex, live, in, the, higher, peaks, to, elevations, of, 3, 400, m, 11, 155, ft, and, plants, such, as, edelweiss, grow, in, rocky, areas, in, lower, elevations, as, well, as, in, higher, elevations, evidence, of, human, habitation, in, the, alps, goes, back, to, the, palaeolithic, era, a, mummified, man, tzi, determined, to, be, 5, 000, years, old, was, discovered, on, a, glacier, at, the, austrian, italian, border, in, 1991, by, the, 6th, century, bc, the, celtic, la, t, ne, culture, was, well, established, hannibal, notably, crossed, the, alps, with, a, herd, of, elephants, and, the, romans, had, settlements, in, the, region, in, 1800, napoleon, crossed, one, of, the, mountain, passes, with, an, army, of, 40, 000, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, saw, an, influx, of, naturalists, writers, and, artists, in, particular, the, romanticists, followed, by, the, golden, age, of, alpinism, as, mountaineers, began, to, ascend, the, peaks, of, the, alps, the, alpine, region, has, a, strong, cultural, identity, traditional, practices, such, as, farming, cheesemaking, and, woodworking, still, thrive, in, alpine, villages, however, the, tourist, industry, began, to, grow, early, in, the, 20th, century, and, expanded, significantly, after, world, war, ii, eventually, becoming, the, dominant, industry, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, winter, olympic, games, have, been, hosted, in, the, swiss, french, italian, austrian, and, german, alps, as, of, 2010, the, region, is, home, to, 14, million, people, and, has, 120, million, annual, visitors, the, english, word, alps, comes, from, the, latin, alpes, the, latin, word, alpes, could, possibly, come, from, the, adjective, albus, white, or, could, possibly, come, from, the, greek, goddess, alphito, whose, name, is, related, to, alphita, the, white, flour, alphos, a, dull, white, leprosy, and, finally, the, proto, indo, european, word, alb, s, similarly, the, river, god, alpheus, is, also, supposed, to, derive, from, the, greek, alphos, and, means, whitish, in, his, commentary, on, the, aeneid, of, virgil, the, late, fourth, century, grammarian, maurus, servius, honoratus, says, that, all, high, mountains, are, called, alpes, by, celts, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, latin, alpes, might, derive, from, a, pre, indo, european, word, alb, hill, albania, is, a, related, derivation, albania, a, name, not, native, to, the, region, known, as, the, country, of, albania, has, been, used, as, a, name, for, several, mountainous, areas, across, europe, in, roman, times, albania, was, a, name, for, the, eastern, caucasus, while, in, the, english, languages, albania, or, albany, was, occasionally, used, as, a, name, for, scotland, although, it, is, more, likely, derived, from, the, latin, word, albus, the, colour, white, in, modern, languages, the, term, alp, alm, albe, or, alpe, refers, to, a, grazing, pastures, in, the, alpine, regions, below, the, glaciers, not, the, peaks, an, alp, refers, to, a, high, mountain, pasture, typically, near, or, above, the, tree, line, where, cows, and, other, livestock, are, taken, to, be, grazed, during, the, summer, months, and, where, huts, and, hay, barns, can, be, found, sometimes, constituting, tiny, hamlets, therefore, the, term, the, alps, as, a, reference, to, the, mountains, is, a, misnomer, the, term, for, the, mountain, peaks, varies, by, nation, and, language, words, such, as, horn, kogel, kopf, gipfel, spitze, stock, and, berg, are, used, in, german, speaking, regions, mont, pic, t, te, pointe, dent, roche, and, aiguille, in, french, speaking, regions, and, monte, picco, corno, punta, pizzo, or, cima, in, italian, speaking, regions, the, alps, are, a, crescent, shaped, geographic, feature, of, central, europe, that, ranges, in, an, 800, km, 500, mi, arc, curved, line, from, east, to, west, and, is, 200, km, 120, mi, in, width, the, mean, height, of, the, mountain, peaks, is, 2, 5, km, 1, 6, mi, the, range, stretches, from, the, mediterranean, sea, north, above, the, po, basin, extending, through, france, from, grenoble, and, stretching, eastward, through, mid, and, southern, switzerland, the, range, continues, onward, toward, vienna, austria, and, southeast, to, the, adriatic, sea, and, slovenia, to, the, south, it, dips, into, northern, italy, and, to, the, north, extends, to, the, southern, border, of, bavaria, in, germany, in, areas, like, chiasso, switzerland, and, allg, u, bavaria, the, demarcation, between, the, mountain, range, and, the, flatlands, are, clear, in, other, places, such, as, geneva, the, demarcation, is, less, clear, the, alps, are, found, in, the, following, countries, austria, 28, 7, of, the, range, s, area, italy, 27, 2, france, 21, 4, switzerland, 13, 2, germany, 5, 8, slovenia, 3, 6, liechtenstein, 0, 08, and, monaco, 0, 001, the, highest, portion, of, the, range, is, divided, by, the, glacial, trough, of, the, rh, ne, valley, from, mont, blanc, to, the, matterhorn, and, monte, rosa, on, the, southern, side, and, the, bernese, alps, on, the, northern, the, peaks, in, the, easterly, portion, of, the, range, in, austria, and, slovenia, are, smaller, than, those, in, the, central, and, western, portions, the, variances, in, nomenclature, in, the, region, spanned, by, the, alps, make, classification, of, the, mountains, and, subregions, difficult, but, a, general, classification, is, that, of, the, eastern, alps, and, western, alps, with, the, divide, between, the, two, occurring, in, eastern, switzerland, according, to, geologist, stefan, schmid, near, the, spl, gen, pass, the, highest, peaks, of, the, western, alps, and, eastern, alps, respectively, are, mont, blanc, at, 4, 810, m, 15, 780, ft, and, piz, bernina, at, 4, 049, m, 13, 284, ft, the, second, highest, major, peaks, are, monte, rosa, at, 4, 634, m, 15, 203, ft, and, ortler, at, 3, 905, m, 12, 810, ft, respectively, a, series, of, lower, mountain, ranges, run, parallel, to, the, main, chain, of, the, alps, including, the, french, prealps, in, france, and, the, jura, mountains, in, switzerland, and, france, the, secondary, chain, of, the, alps, follows, the, watershed, from, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, wienerwald, passing, over, many, of, the, highest, and, most, well, known, peaks, in, the, alps, from, the, colle, di, cadibona, to, col, de, tende, it, runs, westwards, before, turning, to, the, northwest, and, then, near, the, colle, della, maddalena, to, the, north, upon, reaching, the, swiss, border, the, line, of, the, main, chain, heads, approximately, east, northeast, a, heading, it, follows, until, its, end, near, vienna, the, northeast, end, of, the, alpine, arc, directly, on, the, danube, which, flows, into, the, black, sea, is, the, leopoldsberg, near, vienna, in, contrast, the, southeastern, part, of, the, alps, ends, on, the, adriatic, sea, in, the, area, around, trieste, towards, duino, and, barcola, the, alps, have, been, crossed, for, war, and, commerce, and, by, pilgrims, students, and, tourists, crossing, routes, by, road, train, or, foot, are, known, as, passes, and, usually, consist, of, depressions, in, the, mountains, in, which, a, valley, leads, from, the, plains, and, hilly, pre, mountainous, zones, in, the, medieval, period, hospices, were, established, by, religious, orders, at, the, summits, of, many, of, the, main, passes, the, most, important, passes, are, the, col, de, l, iseran, the, highest, the, col, agnel, the, brenner, pass, the, mont, cenis, the, great, st, bernard, pass, the, col, de, tende, the, gotthard, pass, the, semmering, pass, the, simplon, pass, and, the, stelvio, pass, crossing, the, italian, austrian, border, the, brenner, pass, separates, the, tztal, alps, and, zillertal, alps, and, has, been, in, use, as, a, trading, route, since, the, 14th, century, the, lowest, of, the, alpine, passes, at, 985, m, 3, 232, ft, the, semmering, crosses, from, lower, austria, to, styria, since, the, 12th, century, when, a, hospice, was, built, there, it, has, seen, continuous, use, a, railroad, with, a, tunnel, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, long, was, built, along, the, route, of, the, pass, in, the, mid, 19th, century, with, a, summit, of, 2, 469, m, 8, 100, ft, the, great, st, bernard, pass, is, one, of, the, highest, in, the, alps, crossing, the, italian, swiss, border, east, of, the, pennine, alps, along, the, flanks, of, mont, blanc, the, pass, was, used, by, napoleon, bonaparte, to, cross, 40, 000, troops, in, 1800, the, mont, cenis, pass, has, been, a, major, commercial, and, military, road, between, western, europe, and, italy, the, pass, was, crossed, by, many, troops, on, their, way, to, the, italian, peninsula, from, constantine, i, pepin, the, short, and, charlemagne, to, henry, iv, napol, on, and, more, recently, the, german, gebirgsj, gers, during, world, war, ii, now, the, pass, has, been, supplanted, by, the, fr, jus, highway, tunnel, opened, 1980, and, rail, tunnel, opened, 1871, the, saint, gotthard, pass, crosses, from, central, switzerland, to, ticino, in, 1882, the, 15, km, long, 9, 3, mi, saint, gotthard, railway, tunnel, was, opened, connecting, lucerne, in, switzerland, with, milan, in, italy, 98, years, later, followed, gotthard, road, tunnel, 16, 9, km, 10, 5, mi, long, connecting, the, a2, motorway, in, g, schenen, on, the, north, side, with, airolo, on, the, south, side, exactly, like, the, railway, tunnel, on, 1, june, 2016, the, world, s, longest, railway, tunnel, the, gotthard, base, tunnel, was, opened, which, connects, erstfeld, in, canton, of, uri, with, bodio, in, canton, of, ticino, by, two, single, tubes, of, 57, 1, km, 35, 5, mi, it, is, the, first, tunnel, that, traverses, the, alps, on, a, flat, route, from, 11, december, 2016, it, has, been, part, of, the, regular, railway, timetable, and, used, hourly, as, standard, ride, between, basel, lucerne, z, rich, and, bellinzona, lugano, milan, the, highest, pass, in, the, alps, is, the, col, de, l, iseran, in, savoy, france, at, 2, 770, m, 9, 088, ft, followed, by, the, stelvio, pass, in, northern, italy, at, 2, 756, m, 9, 042, ft, the, road, was, built, in, the, 1820s, the, union, internationale, des, associations, d, alpinisme, uiaa, has, defined, a, list, of, 82, official, alpine, summits, that, reach, at, least, 4, 000, m, 13, 123, ft, the, list, includes, not, only, mountains, but, also, subpeaks, with, little, prominence, that, are, considered, important, mountaineering, objectives, below, are, listed, the, 29, four, thousanders, with, at, least, 300, m, 984, ft, of, prominence, while, mont, blanc, was, first, climbed, in, 1786, and, the, jungfrau, in, 1811, most, of, the, alpine, four, thousanders, were, climbed, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, notably, piz, bernina, 1850, the, dom, 1858, the, grand, combin, 1859, the, weisshorn, 1861, and, the, barre, des, crins, 1864, the, ascent, of, the, matterhorn, in, 1865, marked, the, end, of, the, golden, age, of, alpinism, karl, blodig, 1859, 1956, was, among, the, first, to, successfully, climb, all, the, major, 4, 000, m, peaks, he, completed, his, series, of, ascents, in, 1911, many, of, the, big, alpine, three, thousanders, were, climbed, in, the, early, 19th, century, notably, the, grossglockner, 1800, and, the, ortler, 1804, although, some, of, them, were, climbed, only, much, later, such, at, mont, pelvoux, 1848, monte, viso, 1861, and, la, meije, 1877, the, first, british, mont, blanc, ascent, by, a, man, was, in, 1788, the, first, ascent, by, a, woman, was, in, 1808, by, the, mid, 1850s, swiss, mountaineers, had, ascended, most, of, the, peaks, and, were, eagerly, sought, as, mountain, guides, edward, whymper, reached, the, top, of, the, matterhorn, in, 1865, after, seven, attempts, and, in, 1938, the, last, of, the, six, great, north, faces, of, the, alps, was, climbed, with, the, first, ascent, of, the, eiger, nordwand, north, face, of, the, eiger, important, geological, concepts, were, established, as, naturalists, began, studying, the, rock, formations, of, the, alps, in, the, 18th, century, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, now, defunct, idea, of, geosynclines, was, used, to, explain, the, presence, of, folded, mountain, chains, this, theory, was, replaced, in, the, mid, 20th, century, by, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, the, formation, of, the, alps, the, alpine, orogeny, was, an, episodic, process, that, began, about, 300, million, years, ago, in, the, paleozoic, era, the, pangaean, supercontinent, consisted, of, a, single, tectonic, plate, it, broke, into, separate, plates, during, the, mesozoic, era, and, the, tethys, sea, developed, between, laurasia, and, gondwana, during, the, jurassic, period, the, tethys, was, later, squeezed, between, colliding, plates, causing, the, formation, of, mountain, ranges, called, the, alpide, belt, from, gibraltar, through, the, himalayas, to, indonesia, a, process, that, began, at, the, end, of, the, mesozoic, and, continues, into, the, present, the, formation, of, the, alps, was, a, segment, of, this, orogenic, process, caused, by, the, collision, between, the, african, and, the, eurasian, plates, that, began, in, the, late, cretaceous, period, under, extreme, compressive, stresses, and, pressure, marine, sedimentary, rocks, were, uplifted, forming, characteristic, recumbent, folds, and, thrust, faults, as, the, rising, peaks, underwent, erosion, a, layer, of, marine, flysch, sediments, was, deposited, in, the, foreland, basin, and, the, sediments, became, involved, in, younger, folds, as, the, orogeny, progressed, coarse, sediments, from, the, continual, uplift, and, erosion, were, later, deposited, in, foreland, areas, north, of, the, alps, these, regions, in, switzerland, and, bavaria, are, well, developed, containing, classic, examples, of, flysch, which, is, sedimentary, rock, formed, during, mountain, building, the, alpine, orogeny, occurred, in, ongoing, cycles, through, to, the, paleogene, causing, differences, in, folded, structures, with, a, late, stage, orogeny, causing, the, development, of, the, jura, mountains, a, series, of, tectonic, events, in, the, triassic, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, caused, different, paleogeographic, regions, the, alps, are, subdivided, by, different, lithology, rock, composition, and, nappe, structures, according, to, the, orogenic, events, that, affected, them, the, geological, subdivision, differentiates, the, western, eastern, alps, and, southern, alps, the, helveticum, in, the, north, the, penninicum, and, austroalpine, system, in, the, centre, and, south, of, the, periadriatic, seam, the, southern, alpine, system, according, to, geologist, stefan, schmid, because, the, western, alps, underwent, a, metamorphic, event, in, the, cenozoic, era, while, the, austroalpine, peaks, underwent, an, event, in, the, cretaceous, period, the, two, areas, show, distinct, differences, in, nappe, formations, flysch, deposits, in, the, southern, alps, of, lombardy, probably, occurred, in, the, cretaceous, or, later, peaks, in, france, italy, and, switzerland, lie, in, the, houilli, re, zone, which, consists, of, basement, with, sediments, from, the, mesozoic, era, high, massifs, with, external, sedimentary, cover, are, more, common, in, the, western, alps, and, were, affected, by, neogene, period, thin, skinned, thrusting, whereas, the, eastern, alps, have, comparatively, few, high, peaked, massifs, similarly, the, peaks, in, eastern, switzerland, extending, to, western, austria, helvetic, nappes, consist, of, thin, skinned, sedimentary, folding, that, detached, from, former, basement, rock, in, simple, terms, the, structure, of, the, alps, consists, of, layers, of, rock, of, european, african, and, oceanic, tethyan, origin, the, bottom, nappe, structure, is, of, continental, european, origin, above, which, are, stacked, marine, sediment, nappes, topped, off, by, nappes, derived, from, the, african, plate, the, matterhorn, is, an, example, of, the, ongoing, orogeny, and, shows, evidence, of, great, folding, the, tip, of, the, mountain, consists, of, gneisses, from, the, african, plate, the, base, of, the, peak, below, the, glaciated, area, consists, of, european, basement, rock, the, sequence, of, tethyan, marine, sediments, and, their, oceanic, basement, is, sandwiched, between, rock, derived, from, the, african, and, european, plates, the, core, regions, of, the, alpine, orogenic, belt, have, been, folded, and, fractured, in, such, a, manner, that, erosion, produced, the, characteristic, steep, vertical, peaks, of, the, swiss, alps, that, rise, seemingly, straight, out, of, the, foreland, areas, peaks, such, as, mont, blanc, the, matterhorn, and, high, peaks, in, the, pennine, alps, the, brian, onnais, and, hohe, tauern, consist, of, layers, of, rock, from, the, various, orogenies, including, exposures, of, basement, rock, due, to, the, ever, present, geologic, instability, earthquakes, continue, in, the, alps, to, this, day, typically, the, largest, earthquakes, in, the, alps, have, been, between, magnitude, 6, and, 7, on, the, richter, scale, geodetic, measurements, show, ongoing, topographic, uplift, at, rates, of, up, to, about, 2, 5, mm, per, year, in, the, north, western, and, central, alps, and, at, 1, mm, per, year, in, the, eastern, and, south, western, alps, the, underlying, mechanisms, that, jointly, drive, the, present, day, uplift, pattern, are, the, isostatic, rebound, due, to, the, melting, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, ice, cap, or, long, term, erosion, detachment, of, the, western, alpine, subducting, slab, mantle, convection, as, well, as, ongoing, horizontal, convergence, between, africa, and, europe, but, their, relative, contributions, to, the, uplift, of, the, alps, are, difficult, to, quantify, and, likely, to, vary, significantly, in, space, and, time, the, alps, are, a, source, of, minerals, that, have, been, mined, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, 8th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, during, the, hallstatt, culture, celtic, tribes, mined, copper, later, the, romans, mined, gold, for, coins, in, the, bad, gastein, area, erzberg, in, styria, furnishes, high, quality, iron, ore, for, the, steel, industry, crystals, such, as, cinnabar, amethyst, and, quartz, are, found, throughout, much, of, the, alpine, region, the, cinnabar, deposits, in, slovenia, are, a, notable, source, of, cinnabar, pigments, alpine, crystals, have, been, studied, and, collected, for, hundreds, of, years, and, began, to, be, classified, in, the, 18th, century, leonhard, euler, studied, the, shapes, of, crystals, and, by, the, 19th, century, crystal, hunting, was, common, in, alpine, regions, david, friedrich, wiser, amassed, a, collection, of, 8000, crystals, that, he, studied, and, documented, in, the, 20th, century, robert, parker, wrote, a, well, known, work, about, the, rock, crystals, of, the, swiss, alps, at, the, same, period, a, commission, was, established, to, control, and, standardize, the, naming, of, alpine, minerals, in, the, miocene, epoch, the, mountains, underwent, severe, erosion, because, of, glaciation, which, was, noted, in, the, mid, 19th, century, by, naturalist, louis, agassiz, who, presented, a, paper, proclaiming, the, alps, were, covered, in, ice, at, various, intervals, a, theory, he, formed, when, studying, rocks, near, his, neuch, tel, home, which, he, believed, originated, to, the, west, in, the, bernese, oberland, because, of, his, work, he, came, to, be, known, as, the, father, of, the, ice, age, concept, although, other, naturalists, before, him, put, forth, similar, ideas, agassiz, studied, glacier, movement, in, the, 1840s, at, the, unteraar, glacier, where, he, found, the, glacier, moved, 100, m, 328, ft, per, year, more, rapidly, in, the, middle, than, at, the, edges, his, work, was, continued, by, other, scientists, and, now, a, permanent, laboratory, exists, inside, a, glacier, under, the, jungfraujoch, devoted, exclusively, to, the, study, of, alpine, glaciers, glaciers, pick, up, rocks, and, sediment, with, them, as, they, flow, this, causes, erosion, and, the, formation, of, valleys, over, time, the, inn, valley, is, an, example, of, a, valley, carved, by, glaciers, during, the, ice, ages, with, a, typical, terraced, structure, caused, by, erosion, eroded, rocks, from, the, most, recent, ice, age, lie, at, the, bottom, of, the, valley, while, the, top, of, the, valley, consists, of, erosion, from, earlier, ice, ages, glacial, valleys, have, characteristically, steep, walls, reliefs, valleys, with, lower, reliefs, and, talus, slopes, are, remnants, of, glacial, troughs, or, previously, infilled, valleys, moraines, piles, of, rock, picked, up, during, the, movement, of, the, glacier, accumulate, at, edges, centre, and, the, terminus, of, glaciers, alpine, glaciers, can, be, straight, rivers, of, ice, long, sweeping, rivers, spread, in, a, fan, like, shape, piedmont, glaciers, and, curtains, of, ice, that, hang, from, vertical, slopes, of, the, mountain, peaks, the, stress, of, the, movement, causes, the, ice, to, break, and, crack, loudly, perhaps, explaining, why, the, mountains, were, believed, to, be, home, to, dragons, in, the, medieval, period, the, cracking, creates, unpredictable, and, dangerous, crevasses, often, invisible, under, new, snowfall, which, causes, the, greatest, danger, to, mountaineers, glaciers, end, in, ice, caves, the, rh, ne, glacier, by, trailing, into, a, lake, or, river, or, by, shedding, snowmelt, on, a, meadow, sometimes, a, piece, of, glacier, will, detach, or, break, resulting, in, flooding, property, damage, and, loss, of, life, high, levels, of, precipitation, cause, the, glaciers, to, descend, to, permafrost, levels, in, some, areas, whereas, in, other, more, arid, regions, glaciers, remain, above, about, the, 3, 500, m, 11, 483, ft, level, the, 1, 817, km, 2, 702, sq, mi, of, the, alps, covered, by, glaciers, in, 1876, had, shrunk, to, 1, 342, km, 2, 518, sq, mi, by, 1973, resulting, in, decreased, river, run, off, levels, forty, percent, of, the, glaciation, in, austria, has, disappeared, since, 1850, and, 30, of, that, in, switzerland, although, the, alpine, topography, shows, marked, glacial, morphologies, the, mechanisms, by, which, glacial, reshaping, occurs, are, unclear, numerical, modeling, suggests, that, glacial, erosion, propagates, from, low, elevations, to, high, elevations, leading, to, an, early, increase, of, local, relief, followed, by, lowering, of, the, mean, orogen, elevation, the, alps, provide, lowland, europe, with, drinking, water, irrigation, and, hydroelectric, power, although, the, area, is, only, about, 11, of, the, surface, area, of, europe, the, alps, provide, up, to, 90, of, water, to, lowland, europe, particularly, to, arid, areas, and, during, the, summer, months, cities, such, as, milan, depend, on, 80, of, water, from, alpine, runoff, water, from, the, rivers, is, used, in, at, least, 550, hydroelectricity, power, plants, considering, only, those, producing, at, least, 10mw, of, electricity, major, european, rivers, flow, from, the, alps, such, as, the, rhine, the, rh, ne, the, inn, and, the, po, all, of, which, have, headwaters, in, the, alps, and, flow, into, neighbouring, countries, finally, emptying, into, the, north, sea, the, mediterranean, sea, the, adriatic, sea, and, the, black, sea, other, rivers, such, as, the, danube, have, major, tributaries, flowing, into, them, that, originate, in, the, alps, the, rh, ne, is, second, to, the, nile, as, a, freshwater, source, to, the, mediterranean, sea, the, river, begins, as, glacial, meltwater, flows, into, lake, geneva, and, from, there, to, france, where, one, of, its, uses, is, to, cool, nuclear, power, plants, the, rhine, originates, in, a, 30, km, 2, 12, sq, mi, area, in, switzerland, and, represents, almost, 60, of, water, exported, from, the, country, tributary, valleys, some, of, which, are, complicated, channel, water, to, the, main, valleys, which, can, experience, flooding, during, the, snowmelt, season, when, rapid, runoff, causes, debris, torrents, and, swollen, rivers, the, rivers, form, lakes, such, as, lake, geneva, a, crescent, shaped, lake, crossing, the, swiss, border, with, lausanne, on, the, swiss, side, and, the, town, of, evian, les, bains, on, the, french, side, in, germany, the, medieval, st, bartholomew, s, chapel, was, built, on, the, south, side, of, the, k, nigssee, accessible, only, by, boat, or, by, climbing, over, the, abutting, peaks, additionally, the, alps, have, led, to, the, creation, of, large, lakes, in, italy, for, instance, the, sarca, the, primary, inflow, of, lake, garda, originates, in, the, italian, alps, the, italian, lakes, are, a, popular, tourist, destination, since, the, roman, era, for, their, mild, climate, scientists, have, been, studying, the, impact, of, climate, change, and, water, use, for, example, each, year, more, water, is, diverted, from, rivers, for, snowmaking, in, the, ski, resorts, the, effect, of, which, is, yet, unknown, furthermore, the, decrease, of, glaciated, areas, combined, with, a, succession, of, winters, with, lower, than, expected, precipitation, may, have, a, future, impact, on, the, rivers, in, the, alps, as, well, as, an, effect, on, the, water, availability, to, the, lowlands, the, alps, are, a, classic, example, of, what, happens, when, a, temperate, area, at, lower, altitude, gives, way, to, higher, elevation, terrain, elevations, around, the, world, that, have, cold, climates, similar, to, those, of, the, polar, regions, have, been, called, alpine, a, rise, from, sea, level, into, the, upper, regions, of, the, atmosphere, causes, the, temperature, to, decrease, see, adiabatic, lapse, rate, the, effect, of, mountain, chains, on, prevailing, winds, is, to, carry, warm, air, belonging, to, the, lower, region, into, an, upper, zone, where, it, expands, in, volume, at, the, cost, of, a, proportionate, loss, of, temperature, often, accompanied, by, precipitation, in, the, form, of, snow, or, rain, the, height, of, the, alps, is, sufficient, to, divide, the, weather, patterns, in, europe, into, a, wet, north, and, dry, south, because, moisture, is, sucked, from, the, air, as, it, flows, over, the, high, peaks, the, severe, weather, in, the, alps, has, been, studied, since, the, 18th, century, particularly, the, weather, patterns, such, as, the, seasonal, foehn, wind, numerous, weather, stations, were, placed, in, the, mountains, early, in, the, early, 20th, century, providing, continuous, data, for, climatologists, some, of, the, valleys, are, quite, arid, such, as, the, aosta, valley, in, italy, the, maurienne, in, france, the, valais, in, switzerland, and, northern, tyrol, the, areas, that, are, not, arid, and, receive, high, precipitation, experience, periodic, flooding, from, rapid, snowmelt, and, runoff, the, mean, precipitation, in, the, alps, ranges, from, a, low, of, 2, 600, mm, 100, in, per, year, to, 3, 600, mm, 140, in, per, year, with, the, higher, levels, occurring, at, high, altitudes, at, altitudes, between, 1, 000, and, 3, 000, m, 3, 300, and, 9, 800, ft, snowfall, begins, in, november, and, accumulates, through, to, april, or, may, when, the, melt, begins, snow, lines, vary, from, 2, 400, to, 3, 000, m, 7, 900, to, 9, 800, ft, above, which, the, snow, is, permanent, and, the, temperatures, hover, around, the, freezing, point, even, during, july, and, august, high, water, levels, in, streams, and, rivers, peak, in, june, and, july, when, the, snow, is, still, melting, at, the, higher, altitudes, the, alps, are, split, into, five, climatic, zones, each, with, different, vegetation, the, climate, plant, life, and, animal, life, vary, among, the, different, sections, or, zones, of, the, mountains, the, lowest, zone, is, the, colline, zone, which, exists, between, 500, and, 1, 000, m, 1, 600, and, 3, 300, ft, depending, on, the, location, the, montane, zone, extends, from, 800, to, 1, 700, m, 2, 600, to, 5, 600, ft, followed, by, the, sub, alpine, zone, from, 1, 600, to, 2, 400, m, 5, 200, to, 7, 900, ft, the, alpine, zone, extending, from, tree, line, to, the, snow, line, is, followed, by, the, glacial, zone, which, covers, the, glaciated, areas, of, the, mountain, climatic, conditions, show, variances, within, the, same, zones, for, example, weather, conditions, at, the, head, of, a, mountain, valley, extending, directly, from, the, peaks, are, colder, and, more, severe, than, those, at, the, mouth, of, a, valley, which, tend, to, be, less, severe, and, receive, less, snowfall, various, models, of, climate, change, have, been, projected, into, the, 22nd, century, for, the, alps, with, an, expectation, that, a, trend, toward, increased, temperatures, will, have, an, effect, on, snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and, river, runoff, significant, changes, of, both, natural, and, anthropogenic, origins, have, already, been, diagnosed, from, observations, including, a, 5, 6, reduction, per, decade, in, snow, cover, duration, over, the, last, 50, years, which, also, highlights, climate, change, adaptation, needs, due, to, impacts, on, the, climate, and, regional, socio, economic, activities, thirteen, thousand, species, of, plants, have, been, identified, in, the, alpine, regions, alpine, plants, are, grouped, by, habitat, and, soil, type, which, can, be, limestone, or, non, calcareous, the, habitats, range, from, meadows, bogs, and, woodland, deciduous, and, coniferous, areas, to, soil, less, scree, and, moraines, and, rock, faces, and, ridges, a, natural, vegetation, limit, with, altitude, is, given, by, the, presence, of, the, chief, deciduous, trees, oak, beech, ash, and, sycamore, maple, these, do, not, reach, the, same, elevation, nor, are, they, often, found, growing, together, but, their, upper, limit, corresponds, accurately, enough, to, the, change, from, a, temperate, to, a, colder, climate, that, is, further, proved, by, a, change, in, the, presence, of, wild, herbaceous, vegetation, this, limit, usually, lies, about, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, above, the, sea, on, the, north, side, of, the, alps, but, on, the, southern, slopes, it, often, rises, to, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, sometimes, even, to, 1, 700, m, 5, 600, ft, above, the, forestry, there, is, often, a, band, of, dwarf, pine, trees, pinus, mugo, which, is, in, turn, superseded, by, alpenrosen, dwarf, shrubs, typically, rhododendron, ferrugineum, on, acid, soils, or, rhododendron, hirsutum, on, alkaline, soils, although, alpenrose, prefers, acidic, soil, the, plants, are, found, throughout, the, region, above, the, tree, line, is, the, area, defined, as, alpine, where, in, the, alpine, meadow, plants, are, found, that, have, adapted, well, to, harsh, conditions, of, cold, temperatures, aridity, and, high, altitudes, the, alpine, area, fluctuates, greatly, because, of, regional, fluctuations, in, tree, lines, alpine, plants, such, as, the, alpine, gentian, grow, in, abundance, in, areas, such, as, the, meadows, above, the, lauterbrunnental, gentians, are, named, after, the, illyrian, king, gentius, and, 40, species, of, the, early, spring, blooming, flower, grow, in, the, alps, in, a, range, of, 1, 500, to, 2, 400, m, 4, 900, to, 7, 900, ft, writing, about, the, gentians, in, switzerland, d, h, lawrence, described, them, as, darkening, the, day, time, torch, like, with, the, smoking, blueness, of, pluto, s, gloom, gentians, tend, to, appear, repeatedly, as, the, spring, blooming, takes, place, at, progressively, later, dates, moving, from, the, lower, altitude, to, the, higher, altitude, meadows, where, the, snow, melts, much, later, than, in, the, valleys, on, the, highest, rocky, ledges, the, spring, flowers, bloom, in, the, summer, at, these, higher, altitudes, the, plants, tend, to, form, isolated, cushions, in, the, alps, several, species, of, flowering, plants, have, been, recorded, above, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, including, ranunculus, glacialis, androsace, alpina, and, saxifraga, biflora, eritrichium, nanum, commonly, known, as, the, king, of, the, alps, is, the, most, elusive, of, the, alpine, flowers, growing, on, rocky, ridges, at, 2, 600, to, 3, 750, m, 8, 530, to, 12, 300, ft, perhaps, the, best, known, of, the, alpine, plants, is, edelweiss, which, grows, in, rocky, areas, and, can, be, found, at, altitudes, as, low, as, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, and, as, high, as, 3, 400, m, 11, 200, ft, the, plants, that, grow, at, the, highest, altitudes, have, adapted, to, conditions, by, specialization, such, as, growing, in, rock, screes, that, give, protection, from, winds, the, extreme, and, stressful, climatic, conditions, give, way, to, the, growth, of, plant, species, with, secondary, metabolites, important, for, medicinal, purposes, origanum, vulgare, prunella, vulgaris, solanum, nigrum, and, urtica, dioica, are, some, of, the, more, useful, medicinal, species, found, in, the, alps, human, interference, has, nearly, exterminated, the, trees, in, many, areas, and, except, for, the, beech, forests, of, the, austrian, alps, forests, of, deciduous, trees, are, rarely, found, after, the, extreme, deforestation, between, the, 17th, and, 19th, centuries, the, vegetation, has, changed, since, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, the, high, alpine, meadows, cease, to, be, harvested, for, hay, or, used, for, grazing, which, eventually, might, result, in, a, regrowth, of, the, forest, in, some, areas, the, modern, practice, of, building, ski, runs, by, mechanical, means, has, destroyed, the, underlying, tundra, from, which, the, plant, life, cannot, recover, during, the, non, skiing, months, whereas, areas, that, still, practice, a, natural, piste, type, of, ski, slope, building, preserve, the, fragile, underlayers, the, alps, are, a, habitat, for, 30, 000, species, of, wildlife, ranging, from, the, tiniest, snow, fleas, to, brown, bears, many, of, which, have, made, adaptations, to, the, harsh, cold, conditions, and, high, altitudes, to, the, point, that, some, only, survive, in, specific, micro, climates, either, directly, above, or, below, the, snow, line, the, largest, mammal, to, live, in, the, highest, altitudes, are, the, alpine, ibex, which, have, been, sighted, as, high, as, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, the, ibex, live, in, caves, and, descend, to, eat, the, succulent, alpine, grasses, classified, as, antelopes, chamois, are, smaller, than, ibex, and, found, throughout, the, alps, living, above, the, tree, line, and, are, common, in, the, entire, alpine, range, areas, of, the, eastern, alps, are, still, home, to, brown, bears, in, switzerland, the, canton, of, bern, was, named, for, the, bears, but, the, last, bear, is, recorded, as, having, been, killed, in, 1792, above, kleine, scheidegg, by, three, hunters, from, grindelwald, many, rodents, such, as, voles, live, underground, marmots, live, almost, exclusively, above, the, tree, line, as, high, as, 2, 700, m, 8, 900, ft, they, hibernate, in, large, groups, to, provide, warmth, and, can, be, found, in, all, areas, of, the, alps, in, large, colonies, they, build, beneath, the, alpine, pastures, golden, eagles, and, bearded, vultures, are, the, largest, birds, to, be, found, in, the, alps, they, nest, high, on, rocky, ledges, and, can, be, found, at, altitudes, of, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, the, most, common, bird, is, the, alpine, chough, which, can, be, found, scavenging, at, climber, s, huts, or, the, jungfraujoch, a, high, altitude, tourist, destination, reptiles, such, as, adders, and, vipers, live, up, to, the, snow, line, because, they, cannot, bear, the, cold, temperatures, they, hibernate, underground, and, soak, up, the, warmth, on, rocky, ledges, the, high, altitude, alpine, salamanders, have, adapted, to, living, above, the, snow, line, by, giving, birth, to, fully, developed, young, rather, than, laying, eggs, brown, trout, can, be, found, in, the, streams, up, to, the, snow, line, molluscs, such, as, the, wood, snail, live, up, the, snow, line, popularly, gathered, as, food, the, snails, are, now, protected, several, species, of, moths, live, in, the, alps, some, of, which, are, believed, to, have, evolved, in, the, same, habitat, up, to, 120, million, years, ago, long, before, the, alps, were, created, blue, butterflies, can, commonly, be, seen, drinking, from, the, snowmelt, some, species, of, blues, fly, as, high, as, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, the, butterflies, tend, to, be, large, such, as, those, from, the, swallowtail, parnassius, family, with, a, habitat, that, ranges, to, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, twelve, species, of, beetles, have, habitats, up, to, the, snow, line, the, most, beautiful, and, formerly, collected, for, its, colours, but, now, protected, is, rosalia, alpina, spiders, such, as, the, large, wolf, spider, live, above, the, snow, line, and, can, be, seen, as, high, as, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, scorpions, can, be, found, in, the, italian, alps, some, of, the, species, of, moths, and, insects, show, evidence, of, having, been, indigenous, to, the, area, from, as, long, ago, as, the, alpine, orogeny, in, mosson, in, valais, switzerland, dinosaur, tracks, were, found, in, the, 1970s, dating, probably, from, the, triassic, period, when, the, ice, melted, after, the, w, rm, glaciation, paleolithic, settlements, were, established, along, the, lake, shores, and, in, cave, systems, evidence, of, human, habitation, has, been, found, in, caves, near, the, vercors, cave, system, close, to, grenoble, and, echirolles, in, austria, the, mondsee, lake, shows, evidence, of, houses, built, on, piles, standing, stones, have, been, found, in, the, alpine, areas, of, france, and, italy, about, 200, 000, drawings, and, etchings, have, been, documented, and, are, known, as, the, rock, drawings, in, valcamonica, a, mummy, of, a, neolithic, human, known, as, tzi, was, discovered, on, the, similaun, his, clothing, lets, modern, people, assume, that, he, was, an, alpine, farmer, while, the, location, and, manner, of, his, death, suggests, that, tzi, was, traveling, analysis, of, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, tzi, has, shown, that, he, belongs, to, the, k1, subclade, from, the, 13th, to, the, 6th, century, bc, much, of, the, alps, was, settled, by, the, germanic, peoples, lombards, alemanni, bavarii, and, franks, celt, tribes, settled, in, modern, day, switzerland, between, 1500, and, 1000, bc, the, raeti, lived, in, the, eastern, regions, while, the, west, was, occupied, by, the, helvetii, and, the, allobroges, settled, in, the, rh, ne, valley, and, in, savoy, the, ligures, and, adriatic, veneti, lived, in, northwest, italy, and, triveneto, respectively, the, celts, mined, salt, in, areas, such, as, salzburg, where, evidence, was, found, of, the, hallstatt, culture, by, the, 6th, century, bc, the, la, t, ne, culture, was, well, established, in, the, region, and, became, known, for, high, quality, celtic, art, between, 430, and, 400, bc, prolonged, warfare, in, the, alps, resulted, in, the, devastation, of, agricultural, land, and, human, settlements, ultimately, triggering, the, enslavement, of, men, women, and, children, goods, had, to, be, imported, as, a, result, the, etruscan, civilization, responded, to, raids, by, the, massalia, and, acquired, absolute, control, over, the, alpine, trade, routes, aggressors, in, modern, day, italy, were, dealt, with, and, an, alliance, was, formed, with, the, celts, the, grip, of, the, etruscan, settlements, broke, down, as, the, roman, political, system, expanded, so, as, to, take, control, over, alpine, trade, routes, that, connected, human, settlements, in, the, alps, with, settlements, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, second, punic, war, in, 218, bc, the, carthage, general, hannibal, initiated, one, of, the, most, celebrated, achievements, of, any, military, force, in, ancient, warfare, recorded, as, hannibal, crossing, the, alps, the, roman, people, built, roads, along, the, alpine, mountain, passes, which, continued, to, be, used, through, the, medieval, period, roman, road, markers, can, still, be, found, on, the, alpine, mountain, passes, during, the, gallic, wars, in, 58, bc, julius, caesar, defeated, the, helvetii, the, rhaetian, continued, to, resist, but, their, territory, was, eventually, conquered, when, the, romans, crossed, the, danube, valley, and, defeated, the, brigantes, the, romans, built, settlements, in, the, alps, in, towns, such, as, aosta, martigny, lausanne, and, partenkirchen, remains, of, villas, arenas, and, temples, have, been, discovered, christianity, was, established, in, the, alps, by, the, roman, people, monasteries, and, churches, were, constructed, even, at, high, alpine, altitudes, the, franks, expanded, their, carolingian, empire, while, the, baiuvarii, introduced, feudalism, in, the, eastern, alps, the, construction, of, castles, in, the, alps, supported, the, growing, number, of, dukedoms, and, kingdoms, castello, del, buonconsiglio, in, trento, still, has, intricate, frescoes, and, excellent, examples, of, gothic, art, the, ch, teau, de, chillon, is, preserved, as, an, example, of, medieval, architecture, there, are, several, important, alpine, saints, and, one, such, one, is, saint, maurice, much, of, the, medieval, period, was, a, time, of, power, struggles, between, competing, dynasties, such, as, the, house, of, savoy, the, visconti, of, milan, and, the, house, of, habsburg, the, great, st, bernard, hospice, built, in, the, 9th, or, 10th, centuries, at, the, summit, of, the, great, saint, bernard, pass, was, a, shelter, for, humans, and, destination, for, pilgrims, in, 1291, to, protect, themselves, from, incursions, by, the, house, of, habsburg, four, alpine, cantons, drew, up, the, federal, charter, of, 1291, which, is, considered, to, be, a, declaration, of, independence, from, neighboring, kingdoms, after, a, series, of, battles, fought, in, the, 13th, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, more, cantons, joined, the, confederacy, and, by, the, 16th, century, switzerland, was, established, as, a, sovereign, state, in, the, alps, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, fallout, resulted, in, a, 1713, treaty, part, of, the, peace, of, utrecht, which, relocated, the, western, alps, border, along, the, watersheds, historically, the, alps, were, used, to, determine, the, borders, of, political, and, administrative, gangs, but, the, peace, of, utrecht, was, the, first, significant, body, of, treaty, that, considered, geographical, conditions, the, alps, were, carved, up, and, borders, were, agreed, so, that, enclaves, in, the, alps, could, be, eliminated, during, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, napoleon, annexed, territory, formerly, controlled, by, the, house, of, habsburg, and, the, house, of, savoy, in, 1798, the, helvetic, republic, was, established, two, years, later, an, army, across, the, great, st, bernard, pass, in, 1799, the, russian, imperial, military, engaged, the, revolutionary, french, army, in, the, alps, this, episode, has, been, recorded, as, significant, achievement, in, mountain, warfare, in, october, 1799, the, troops, commanded, by, alexander, suvorov, were, surrounded, in, the, alps, by, much, larger, french, troops, the, russian, troops, broke, out, mauled, the, french, troops, and, retreated, through, the, panix, pass, after, the, fall, of, napoleon, many, alpine, countries, developed, heavy, protections, to, prevent, further, invasion, thus, savoy, built, a, series, of, fortifications, to, protect, the, major, alpine, passes, such, as, the, col, du, mont, cenis, which, was, crossed, by, charlemagne, to, obliterate, the, lombards, in, the, 19th, century, the, monasteries, built, in, the, alps, to, shelter, humans, became, tourist, destinations, the, benedictines, had, built, monasteries, in, lucerne, and, oberammergau, the, cistercians, built, their, temple, at, lake, constance, meanwhile, the, augustinians, maintained, abbeys, in, savoy, and, one, in, interlaken, radiocarbon, dated, charcoal, placed, around, 50, 000, years, ago, was, found, in, the, drachloch, dragon, s, hole, cave, above, the, village, of, vattis, in, the, canton, of, st, gallen, proving, that, the, high, peaks, were, visited, by, prehistoric, people, seven, bear, skulls, from, the, cave, may, have, been, buried, by, the, same, prehistoric, people, the, peaks, however, were, mostly, ignored, except, for, a, few, notable, examples, and, long, left, to, the, exclusive, attention, of, the, people, of, the, adjoining, valleys, the, mountain, peaks, were, seen, as, terrifying, the, abode, of, dragons, and, demons, to, the, point, that, people, blindfolded, themselves, to, cross, the, alpine, passes, the, glaciers, remained, a, mystery, and, many, still, believed, the, highest, areas, to, be, inhabited, by, dragons, charles, vii, of, france, ordered, his, chamberlain, to, climb, mont, aiguille, in, 1356, the, knight, reached, the, summit, of, rocciamelone, where, he, left, a, bronze, triptych, of, three, crosses, a, feat, which, he, conducted, with, the, use, of, ladders, to, traverse, the, ice, in, 1492, antoine, de, ville, climbed, mont, aiguille, without, reaching, the, summit, an, experience, he, described, as, horrifying, and, terrifying, leonardo, da, vinci, was, fascinated, by, variations, of, light, in, the, higher, altitudes, and, climbed, a, mountain, scholars, are, uncertain, which, one, some, believe, it, may, have, been, monte, rosa, from, his, description, of, a, blue, like, that, of, a, gentian, sky, it, is, thought, that, he, reached, a, significantly, high, altitude, in, the, 18th, century, four, chamonix, men, almost, made, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, but, were, overcome, by, altitude, sickness, and, snowblindness, conrad, gessner, was, the, first, naturalist, to, ascend, the, mountains, in, the, 16th, century, to, study, them, writing, that, in, the, mountains, he, found, the, theatre, of, the, lord, by, the, 19th, century, more, naturalists, began, to, arrive, to, explore, study, and, conquer, the, high, peaks, two, men, who, first, explored, the, regions, of, ice, and, snow, were, horace,

world, with, many, resorts, such, as, oberstdorf, in, bavaria, saalbach, in, austria, davos, in, switzerland, chamonix, in, france, and, cortina, d, ampezzo, in, italy, recording, more, than, a, million, annual, visitors, with, over, 120, million, visitors, a, year, tourism, is, integral, to, the, alpine, economy, with, much, of, it, coming, from, winter, sports, although, summer, visitors, are, also, an, important, component, the, tourism, industry, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, foreigners, visited, the, alps, travelled, to, the, bases, of, the, mountains, to, enjoy, the, scenery, and, stayed, at, the, spa, resorts, large, hotels, were, built, during, the, belle, poque, cog, railways, built, early, in, the, 20th, century, brought, tourists, to, ever, higher, elevations, with, the, jungfraubahn, terminating, at, the, jungfraujoch, well, above, the, eternal, snow, line, after, going, through, a, tunnel, in, eiger, during, this, period, winter, sports, were, slowly, introduced, in, 1882, the, first, figure, skating, championship, was, held, in, st, moritz, and, downhill, skiing, became, a, popular, sport, with, english, visitors, early, in, the, 20th,

popularity, of, downhill, skiing, increased, greatly, as, it, became, more, accessible, and, in, the, 1970s, several, new, villages, were, built, in, france, devoted, almost, exclusively, to, skiing, such, as, les, menuires, until, this, point, austria, and, switzerland, had, been, the, traditional, and, more, popular, destinations, for, winter, sports, and, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, and, into, the, early, 21st, century, france, italy, and, tyrol, began, to, see, increases, in, winter, visitors, since, the, 1980s, tourism, expansion, and, easy, global, access, generate, grave, concerns, regarding, the, loss, of, traditional, alpine, culture, and, many, uncertainties, about, sustainable, development, as, a, likely, result, of, climatic, change, the, number, of, high,
