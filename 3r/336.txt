the, andes, n, d, i, z, an, deez, andes, mountains, or, andean, mountain, range, spanish, cordillera, de, los, andes, quechua, anti, are, the, longest, continental, mountain, range, in, the, world, forming, a, continuous, highland, along, the, western, edge, of, south, america, the, range, is, 8, 900, km, 5, 530, mi, long, and, 200, to, 700, km, 124, to, 435, mi, wide, widest, between, 18, s, and, 20, s, latitude, and, has, an, average, height, of, about, 4, 000, m, 13, 123, ft, the, andes, extend, from, south, to, north, through, seven, south, american, countries, argentina, chile, bolivia, peru, ecuador, colombia, and, venezuela, along, their, length, the, andes, are, split, into, several, ranges, separated, by, intermediate, depressions, the, andes, are, the, location, of, several, high, plateaus, some, of, which, host, major, cities, such, as, quito, bogot, cali, arequipa, medell, n, bucaramanga, sucre, m, rida, el, alto, and, la, paz, the, altiplano, plateau, is, the, world, s, second, highest, after, the, tibetan, plateau, these, ranges, are, in, turn, grouped, into, three, major, divisions, based, on, climate, the, tropical, andes, the, dry, andes, and, the, wet, andes, the, andes, are, the, highest, mountain, range, outside, asia, the, range, s, highest, peak, argentina, s, aconcagua, rises, to, an, elevation, of, about, 6, 961, m, 22, 838, ft, above, sea, level, the, peak, of, chimborazo, in, the, ecuadorian, andes, is, farther, from, the, earth, s, center, than, any, other, location, on, the, earth, s, surface, due, to, the, equatorial, bulge, resulting, from, the, earth, s, rotation, the, world, s, highest, volcanoes, are, in, the, andes, including, ojos, del, salado, on, the, chile, argentina, border, which, rises, to, 6, 893, m, 22, 615, ft, the, andes, are, also, part, of, the, american, cordillera, a, chain, of, mountain, ranges, cordillera, that, consists, of, an, almost, continuous, sequence, of, mountain, ranges, that, form, the, western, backbone, of, the, americas, and, antarctica, the, etymology, of, the, word, andes, has, been, debated, the, majority, consensus, is, that, it, derives, from, the, quechua, word, anti, east, as, in, antisuyu, quechua, for, east, region, one, of, the, four, regions, of, the, inca, empire, the, term, cordillera, comes, from, the, spanish, word, cordel, rope, and, is, used, as, a, descriptive, name, for, several, contiguous, sections, of, the, andes, as, well, as, the, entire, andean, range, and, the, combined, mountain, chain, along, the, western, part, of, the, north, and, south, american, continents, the, andes, can, be, divided, into, three, sections, at, the, northern, end, of, the, andes, the, separate, sierra, nevada, de, santa, marta, range, is, often, but, not, always, treated, as, part, of, the, northern, andes, the, leeward, antilles, islands, aruba, bonaire, and, cura, ao, which, lie, in, the, caribbean, sea, off, the, coast, of, venezuela, were, formerly, thought, to, represent, the, submerged, peaks, of, the, extreme, northern, edge, of, the, andes, range, but, ongoing, geological, studies, indicate, that, such, a, simplification, does, not, do, justice, to, the, complex, tectonic, boundary, between, the, south, american, and, caribbean, plates, the, andes, are, an, orogenic, belt, of, mountains, along, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, a, zone, of, volcanic, activity, that, encompasses, the, pacific, rim, of, the, americas, as, well, as, the, asia, pacific, region, the, andes, are, the, result, of, tectonic, plate, processes, extending, during, the, mesozoic, and, tertiary, eras, caused, by, the, subduction, of, oceanic, crust, beneath, the, south, american, plate, as, the, nazca, plate, and, south, american, plate, converge, these, processes, were, accelerated, by, the, effects, of, climate, as, the, uplift, of, the, andes, created, a, rain, shadow, on, the, western, fringes, of, chile, ocean, currents, and, prevailing, winds, carried, moisture, away, from, the, chilean, coast, this, caused, some, areas, of, the, subduction, zone, to, be, sediment, starved, causing, excess, friction, and, an, increased, rate, of, compressed, coastal, uplift, the, main, cause, of, the, rise, of, the, andes, is, the, compression, of, the, western, rim, of, the, south, american, plate, due, to, the, subduction, of, the, nazca, plate, and, the, antarctic, plate, to, the, east, the, andes, range, is, bounded, by, several, sedimentary, basins, such, as, the, orinoco, basin, the, amazon, basin, the, madre, de, dios, basin, and, the, gran, chaco, that, separate, the, andes, from, the, ancient, cratons, in, eastern, south, america, in, the, south, the, andes, share, a, long, boundary, with, the, former, patagonia, terrane, to, the, west, the, andes, end, at, the, pacific, ocean, although, the, peru, chile, trench, can, be, considered, their, ultimate, western, limit, from, a, geographical, approach, the, andes, are, considered, to, have, their, western, boundaries, marked, by, the, appearance, of, coastal, lowlands, and, less, rugged, topography, the, andes, also, contain, large, quantities, of, iron, ore, located, in, many, mountains, within, the, range, the, andean, orogen, has, a, series, of, bends, or, oroclines, the, bolivian, orocline, is, a, seaward, concave, bending, in, the, coast, of, south, america, and, the, andes, mountains, at, about, 18, s, at, this, point, the, orientation, of, the, andes, turns, from, northwest, in, peru, to, south, in, chile, and, argentina, the, andean, segments, north, and, south, of, the, orocline, have, been, rotated, 15, counter, clockwise, to, 20, clockwise, respectively, the, bolivian, orocline, area, overlaps, with, the, area, of, the, maximum, width, of, the, altiplano, plateau, and, according, to, isacks, 1988, the, orocline, is, related, to, crustal, shortening, the, specific, point, at, 18, s, where, the, coastline, bends, is, known, as, the, arica, elbow, further, south, lies, the, maipo, orocline, a, more, subtle, orocline, between, 30, s, and, 38, s, with, a, seaward, concave, break, in, the, trend, at, 33, s, near, the, southern, tip, of, the, andes, lies, the, patagonian, orocline, the, western, rim, of, the, south, american, plate, has, been, the, place, of, several, pre, andean, orogenies, since, at, least, the, late, proterozoic, and, early, paleozoic, when, several, terranes, and, microcontinents, collided, and, amalgamated, with, the, ancient, cratons, of, eastern, south, america, by, then, the, south, american, part, of, gondwana, the, formation, of, the, modern, andes, began, with, the, events, of, the, triassic, when, pangaea, began, the, breakup, that, resulted, in, developing, several, rifts, the, development, continued, through, the, jurassic, period, it, was, during, the, cretaceous, period, that, the, andes, began, to, take, their, present, form, by, the, uplifting, faulting, and, folding, of, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rocks, of, the, ancient, cratons, to, the, east, the, rise, of, the, andes, has, not, been, constant, as, different, regions, have, had, different, degrees, of, tectonic, stress, uplift, and, erosion, across, the, 1, 000, kilometer, wide, 620, mi, drake, passage, lie, the, mountains, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, south, of, the, scotia, plate, which, appear, to, be, a, continuation, of, the, andes, chain, the, far, east, regions, of, the, andes, experience, a, series, of, changes, resulting, from, the, andean, orogeny, parts, of, the, suns, s, orogen, in, amazonian, craton, disappeared, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, being, overridden, by, the, andes, the, sierras, de, c, rdoba, where, the, effects, of, the, ancient, pampean, orogeny, can, be, observed, owe, their, modern, uplift, and, relief, to, the, andean, orogeny, in, the, tertiary, further, south, in, southern, patagonia, the, onset, of, the, andean, orogeny, caused, the, magallanes, basin, to, evolve, from, being, an, extensional, back, arc, basin, in, the, mesozoic, to, being, a, compressional, foreland, basin, in, the, cenozoic, tectonic, forces, above, the, subduction, zone, along, the, entire, west, coast, of, south, america, where, the, nazca, plate, and, a, part, of, the, antarctic, plate, are, sliding, beneath, the, south, american, plate, continue, to, produce, an, ongoing, orogenic, event, resulting, in, minor, to, major, earthquakes, and, volcanic, eruptions, to, this, day, many, high, magnitude, earthquakes, have, been, recorded, in, the, region, such, as, the, 2010, maule, earthquake, m8, 8, the, 2015, illapel, earthquake, m8, 2, and, the, 1960, valdivia, earthquake, m9, 5, which, as, of, 2024, was, the, strongest, ever, recorded, on, seismometers, the, amount, magnitude, and, type, of, seismic, activity, varies, greatly, along, the, subduction, zone, these, differences, are, due, to, a, wide, range, of, factors, including, friction, between, the, plates, angle, of, subduction, buoyancy, of, the, subducting, plate, rate, of, subduction, and, hydration, value, of, the, mantle, material, the, highest, rate, of, seismic, activity, is, observed, in, the, central, portion, of, the, boundary, between, 33, s, and, 35, s, in, this, area, the, angle, of, subduction, is, very, low, meaning, the, subducting, plate, is, nearly, horizontal, studies, of, mantle, hydration, across, the, subduction, zone, have, shown, a, correlation, between, increased, material, hydration, and, lower, magnitude, more, frequent, seismic, activity, zones, exhibiting, dehydration, instead, are, thought, to, have, a, higher, potential, for, larger, high, magnitude, earthquakes, in, the, future, the, mountain, range, is, also, a, source, of, shallow, intraplate, earthquakes, within, the, south, american, plate, the, largest, such, earthquake, as, of, 2024, struck, peru, in, 1947, and, measured, m, s, 7, 5, in, the, peruvian, andes, these, earthquakes, display, normal, 1946, strike, slip, 1976, and, reverse, 1969, 1983, mechanisms, the, amazonian, craton, is, actively, underthrusted, beneath, the, sub, andes, region, of, peru, producing, thrust, faults, in, colombia, ecuador, and, peru, thrust, faulting, occurs, along, the, sub, andes, due, in, response, to, compression, brought, on, by, subduction, while, in, the, high, andes, normal, faulting, occurs, in, response, to, gravitational, forces, in, the, extreme, south, a, major, transform, fault, separates, tierra, del, fuego, from, the, small, scotia, plate, the, andes, range, has, many, active, volcanoes, distributed, in, four, volcanic, zones, separated, by, areas, of, inactivity, the, andean, volcanism, is, a, result, of, the, subduction, of, the, nazca, plate, and, antarctic, plate, underneath, the, south, american, plate, the, belt, is, subdivided, into, four, main, volcanic, zones, that, are, separated, from, each, other, by, volcanic, gaps, the, volcanoes, of, the, belt, are, diverse, in, terms, of, activity, style, products, and, morphology, while, some, differences, can, be, explained, by, which, volcanic, zone, a, volcano, belongs, to, there, are, significant, differences, inside, volcanic, zones, and, even, between, neighboring, volcanoes, despite, being, a, typical, location, for, calc, alkalic, and, subduction, volcanism, the, andean, volcanic, belt, has, a, large, range, of, volcano, tectonic, settings, such, as, rift, systems, extensional, zones, transpressional, faults, subduction, of, mid, ocean, ridges, and, seamount, chains, apart, from, a, large, range, of, crustal, thicknesses, and, magma, ascent, paths, and, different, amount, of, crustal, assimilations, the, andes, mountains, host, large, ore, and, salt, deposits, and, some, of, their, eastern, fold, and, thrust, belts, act, as, traps, for, commercially, exploitable, amounts, of, hydrocarbons, in, the, forelands, of, the, atacama, desert, some, of, the, largest, porphyry, copper, mineralizations, occur, making, chile, and, peru, the, first, and, second, largest, exporters, of, copper, in, the, world, porphyry, copper, in, the, western, slopes, of, the, andes, has, been, generated, by, hydrothermal, fluids, mostly, water, during, the, cooling, of, plutons, or, volcanic, systems, the, porphyry, mineralization, further, benefited, from, the, dry, climate, that, reduced, the, disturbing, actions, of, meteoric, water, the, dry, climate, in, the, central, western, andes, has, also, led, to, the, creation, of, extensive, saltpeter, deposits, which, were, extensively, mined, until, the, invention, of, synthetic, nitrates, yet, another, result, of, the, dry, climate, are, the, salars, of, atacama, and, uyuni, the, former, being, the, largest, source, of, lithium, and, the, latter, the, world, s, largest, reserve, of, the, element, early, mesozoic, and, neogene, plutonism, in, bolivia, s, cordillera, central, created, the, bolivian, tin, belt, as, well, as, the, famous, now, mostly, depleted, deposits, of, cerro, rico, de, potos, the, andes, mountains, initially, inhabited, by, hunter, gatherers, experienced, the, development, of, agriculture, and, the, rise, of, politically, centralized, civilizations, which, culminated, in, the, establishment, of, the, century, long, inca, empire, this, all, changed, in, the, 16th, century, when, the, spanish, conquistadors, colonized, the, mountains, in, advance, of, the, mining, economy, in, the, tide, of, anti, imperialist, nationalism, the, andes, became, the, scene, of, a, series, of, independence, wars, in, the, 19th, century, when, rebel, forces, swept, through, the, region, to, overthrow, spanish, colonial, rule, since, then, many, former, spanish, territories, have, become, five, independent, andean, states, the, climate, in, the, andes, varies, greatly, depending, on, latitude, altitude, and, proximity, to, the, sea, temperature, atmospheric, pressure, and, humidity, decrease, in, higher, elevations, the, southern, section, is, rainy, and, cool, while, the, central, section, is, dry, the, northern, andes, are, typically, rainy, and, warm, with, an, average, temperature, of, 18, c, 64, f, in, colombia, the, climate, is, known, to, change, drastically, in, rather, short, distances, rainforests, exist, just, kilometers, away, from, the, snow, covered, peak, of, cotopaxi, the, mountains, have, a, large, effect, on, the, temperatures, of, nearby, areas, the, snow, line, depends, on, the, location, it, is, between, 4, 500, and, 4, 800, m, 14, 764, and, 15, 748, ft, in, the, tropical, ecuadorian, colombian, venezuelan, and, northern, peruvian, andes, rising, to, 4, 800, 5, 200, m, 15, 748, 17, 060, ft, in, the, drier, mountains, of, southern, peru, and, northern, chile, south, to, about, 30, s, before, descending, to, 4, 500, m, 14, 760, ft, on, aconcagua, at, 32, s, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, at, 40, s, 500, m, 1, 640, ft, at, 50, s, and, only, 300, m, 980, ft, in, tierra, del, fuego, at, 55, s, from, 50, s, several, of, the, larger, glaciers, descend, to, sea, level, the, andes, of, chile, and, argentina, can, be, divided, into, two, climatic, and, glaciological, zones, the, dry, andes, and, the, wet, andes, since, the, dry, andes, extend, from, the, latitudes, of, the, atacama, desert, to, the, area, of, the, maule, river, precipitation, is, more, sporadic, and, there, are, strong, temperature, oscillations, the, line, of, equilibrium, may, shift, drastically, over, short, periods, of, time, leaving, a, whole, glacier, in, the, ablation, area, or, in, the, accumulation, area, in, the, high, andes, of, central, chile, and, mendoza, province, rock, glaciers, are, larger, and, more, common, than, glaciers, this, is, due, to, the, high, exposure, to, solar, radiation, in, these, regions, glaciers, occur, typically, at, higher, altitudes, than, rock, glaciers, the, lowest, active, rock, glaciers, occur, at, 900, m, a, s, l, in, aconcagua, though, precipitation, increases, with, height, there, are, semiarid, conditions, in, the, nearly, 7, 000, metre, 22, 966, ft, highest, mountains, of, the, andes, this, dry, steppe, climate, is, considered, to, be, typical, of, the, subtropical, position, at, 32, 34, s, the, valley, bottoms, have, no, woods, just, dwarf, scrub, the, largest, glaciers, for, example, the, plomo, glacier, and, the, horcones, glaciers, do, not, even, reach, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, in, length, and, have, only, insignificant, ice, thickness, at, glacial, times, however, c, 20, 000, years, ago, the, glaciers, were, over, ten, times, longer, on, the, east, side, of, this, section, of, the, mendozina, andes, they, flowed, down, to, 2, 060, m, 6, 759, ft, and, on, the, west, side, to, about, 1, 220, m, 4, 003, ft, above, sea, level, the, massifs, of, aconcagua, 6, 961, m, 22, 838, ft, tupungato, 6, 550, m, 21, 490, ft, and, nevado, juncal, 6, 110, m, 20, 046, ft, are, tens, of, kilometres, away, from, each, other, and, were, connected, by, a, joint, ice, stream, network, the, andes, dendritic, glacier, arms, components, of, valley, glaciers, were, up, to, 112, 5, km, 69, 9, mi, long, and, over, 1, 250, m, 4, 101, ft, thick, and, spanned, a, vertical, distance, of, 5, 150, m, 16, 896, ft, the, climatic, glacier, snowline, ela, was, lowered, from, 4, 600, m, 15, 092, ft, to, 3, 200, m, 10, 499, ft, at, glacial, times, the, andean, region, cuts, across, several, natural, and, floristic, regions, due, to, its, extension, from, caribbean, venezuela, to, cold, windy, and, wet, cape, horn, passing, through, the, hyperarid, atacama, desert, rainforests, and, tropical, dry, forests, used, to, encircle, much, of, the, northern, andes, but, are, now, greatly, diminished, especially, in, the, choc, and, inter, andean, valleys, of, colombia, opposite, the, humid, andean, slopes, are, the, relatively, dry, andean, slopes, in, most, of, western, peru, chile, and, argentina, along, with, several, interandean, valles, they, are, typically, dominated, by, deciduous, woodland, shrub, and, xeric, vegetation, reaching, the, extreme, in, the, slopes, near, the, virtually, lifeless, atacama, desert, about, 30, 000, species, of, vascular, plants, live, in, the, andes, with, roughly, half, being, endemic, to, the, region, surpassing, the, diversity, of, any, other, hotspot, the, small, tree, cinchona, pubescens, a, source, of, quinine, which, is, used, to, treat, malaria, is, found, widely, in, the, andes, as, far, south, as, bolivia, other, important, crops, that, originated, from, the, andes, are, tobacco, and, potatoes, the, high, altitude, polylepis, forests, and, woodlands, are, found, in, the, andean, areas, of, colombia, ecuador, peru, bolivia, and, chile, these, trees, by, locals, referred, to, as, que, ua, yagual, and, other, names, can, be, found, at, altitudes, of, 4, 500, m, 14, 760, ft, above, sea, level, it, remains, unclear, if, the, patchy, distribution, of, these, forests, and, woodlands, is, natural, or, the, result, of, clearing, which, began, during, the, incan, period, regardless, in, modern, times, the, clearance, has, accelerated, and, the, trees, are, now, considered, highly, endangered, with, some, believing, that, as, little, as, 10, of, the, original, woodland, remains, the, andes, are, rich, in, fauna, with, almost, 1, 000, species, of, which, roughly, 2, 3, are, endemic, to, the, region, the, andes, are, the, most, important, region, in, the, world, for, amphibians, the, diversity, of, animals, in, the, andes, is, high, with, almost, 600, species, of, mammals, 13, endemic, more, than, 1, 700, species, of, birds, about, 1, 3, endemic, more, than, 600, species, of, reptiles, about, 45, endemic, and, almost, 400, species, of, fish, about, 1, 3, endemic, the, vicu, a, and, guanaco, can, be, found, living, in, the, altiplano, while, the, closely, related, domesticated, llama, and, alpaca, are, widely, kept, by, locals, as, pack, animals, and, for, their, meat, and, wool, the, crepuscular, active, during, dawn, and, dusk, chinchillas, two, threatened, members, of, the, rodent, order, inhabit, the, andes, alpine, regions, the, andean, condor, the, largest, bird, of, its, kind, in, the, western, hemisphere, occurs, throughout, much, of, the, andes, but, generally, in, very, low, densities, other, animals, found, in, the, relatively, open, habitats, of, the, high, andes, include, the, huemul, cougar, foxes, in, the, genus, pseudalopex, and, for, birds, certain, species, of, tinamous, notably, members, of, the, genus, nothoprocta, andean, goose, giant, coot, flamingos, mainly, associated, with, hypersaline, lakes, lesser, rhea, andean, flicker, diademed, sandpiper, plover, miners, sierra, finches, and, diuca, finches, lake, titicaca, hosts, several, endemics, among, them, the, highly, endangered, titicaca, flightless, grebe, and, titicaca, water, frog, a, few, species, of, hummingbirds, notably, some, hillstars, can, be, seen, at, altitudes, above, 4, 000, m, 13, 100, ft, but, far, higher, diversities, can, be, found, at, lower, altitudes, especially, in, the, humid, andean, forests, cloud, forests, growing, on, slopes, in, colombia, ecuador, peru, bolivia, and, far, northwestern, argentina, these, forest, types, which, includes, the, yungas, and, parts, of, the, choc, are, very, rich, in, flora, and, fauna, although, few, large, mammals, exist, exceptions, being, the, threatened, mountain, tapir, spectacled, bear, and, yellow, tailed, woolly, monkey, birds, of, humid, andean, forests, include, mountain, toucans, quetzals, and, the, andean, cock, of, the, rock, while, mixed, species, flocks, dominated, by, tanagers, and, furnariids, are, commonly, seen, in, contrast, to, several, vocal, but, typically, cryptic, species, of, wrens, tapaculos, and, antpittas, a, number, of, species, such, as, the, royal, cinclodes, and, white, browed, tit, spinetail, are, associated, with, polylepis, and, consequently, also, threatened, the, andes, mountains, form, a, north, south, axis, of, cultural, influences, a, long, series, of, cultural, development, culminated, in, the, expansion, of, the, inca, civilization, and, inca, empire, in, the, central, andes, during, the, 15th, century, the, incas, formed, this, civilization, through, imperialistic, militarism, as, well, as, careful, and, meticulous, governmental, management, the, government, sponsored, the, construction, of, aqueducts, and, roads, in, addition, to, pre, existing, installations, some, of, these, constructions, still, exist, today, devastated, by, european, diseases, and, by, civil, war, the, incas, were, defeated, in, 1532, by, an, alliance, composed, of, tens, of, thousands, of, allies, from, nations, they, had, subjugated, e, g, huancas, chachapoyas, ca, aris, and, a, small, army, of, 180, spaniards, led, by, francisco, pizarro, one, of, the, few, inca, sites, the, spanish, never, found, in, their, conquest, was, machu, picchu, which, lay, hidden, on, a, peak, on, the, eastern, edge, of, the, andes, where, they, descend, to, the, amazon, the, main, surviving, languages, of, the, andean, peoples, are, those, of, the, quechua, and, aymara, language, families, woodbine, parish, and, joseph, barclay, pentland, surveyed, a, large, part, of, the, bolivian, andes, from, 1826, to, 1827, in, modern, times, the, largest, cities, in, the, andes, are, bogot, with, a, metropolitan, population, of, over, ten, million, and, santiago, medell, n, cali,

roads, while, smaller, towns, are, often, connected, by, dirt, roads, which, may, require, a, four, wheel, drive, vehicle, the, rough, terrain, has, historically, put, the, costs, of, building, highways, and, railroads, that, cross, the, andes, out, of, reach, of, most, neighboring, countries, even, with, modern, civil, engineering, practices, for, example, the, main, crossover, of, the, andes, between, argentina, and, chile, is, still, accomplished, through, the, paso, internacional, los, libertadores, only, recently, have, the, ends, of, some, highways, that, came, rather, close, to, one, another, from, the, east, and, the, west, been, connected, much, of, the, transportation, of, passengers, is, done, via, aircraft, however, there, is, one, railroad, that, connects, chile, with, peru, via, the, andes, and, there, are, others, that, make, the, same, connection, via, southern, bolivia, there, are, multiple, highways, in, bolivia, that, cross, the, andes, some, of, these,
