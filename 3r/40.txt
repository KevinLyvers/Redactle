the, caribbean, sea, is, a, sea, of, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, tropics, of, the, western, hemisphere, it, is, bounded, by, mexico, and, central, america, to, the, west, and, southwest, to, the, north, by, the, greater, antilles, starting, with, cuba, to, the, east, by, the, lesser, antilles, and, to, the, south, by, the, northern, coast, of, south, america, the, gulf, of, mexico, lies, to, the, northwest, the, entire, caribbean, sea, area, the, numerous, islands, of, the, west, indies, and, adjacent, mainland, coastal, regions, are, collectively, known, as, the, caribbean, the, caribbean, sea, is, one, of, the, largest, seas, on, earth, and, has, an, area, of, about, 2, 754, 000, km, 2, 1, 063, 000, sq, mi, the, sea, s, deepest, point, is, the, cayman, trough, between, the, cayman, islands, and, jamaica, at, 7, 686, m, 25, 217, ft, below, sea, level, the, caribbean, coastline, has, many, gulfs, and, bays, the, gulf, of, gon, ve, the, gulf, of, venezuela, the, gulf, of, dari, n, golfo, de, los, mosquitos, the, gulf, of, paria, and, the, gulf, of, honduras, the, caribbean, sea, has, the, world, s, second, largest, barrier, reef, the, mesoamerican, barrier, reef, it, runs, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, along, the, mexico, belize, guatemala, and, honduras, coasts, the, name, caribbean, derives, from, the, caribs, one, of, the, region, s, dominant, native, people, at, the, time, of, european, contact, during, the, late, 15th, century, after, christopher, columbus, landed, in, the, bahamas, in, 1492, and, later, discovered, some, of, the, islands, in, the, caribbean, the, spanish, term, antillas, applied, to, the, lands, stemming, from, this, the, sea, of, the, antilles, became, a, common, alternative, name, for, the, caribbean, sea, in, various, european, languages, spanish, dominance, in, the, region, remained, undisputed, during, the, first, century, of, european, colonization, from, the, 16th, century, europeans, visiting, the, caribbean, region, distinguished, the, south, sea, the, pacific, ocean, south, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, from, the, north, sea, the, caribbean, sea, north, of, the, same, isthmus, the, caribbean, sea, had, been, unknown, to, the, populations, of, eurasia, until, after, 1492, when, christopher, columbus, sailed, into, caribbean, waters, to, find, a, sea, route, to, asia, at, that, time, the, americas, were, generally, unknown, to, most, europeans, although, they, had, been, visited, in, the, 10th, century, by, the, vikings, following, columbus, s, discovery, of, the, islands, the, area, was, quickly, colonized, by, several, western, cultures, initially, spain, then, later, england, the, dutch, republic, france, courland, and, denmark, following, the, colonization, of, the, caribbean, islands, the, caribbean, sea, became, a, busy, area, for, european, based, marine, trading, and, transports, this, commerce, eventually, attracted, pirates, such, as, samuel, bellamy, and, blackbeard, as, of, 2015, the, area, is, home, to, 22, island, territories, and, borders, 12, continental, countries, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, caribbean, sea, as, follows, although, trinidad, and, tobago, and, barbados, are, on, the, same, continental, shelf, they, are, considered, to, be, in, the, atlantic, ocean, rather, than, in, the, caribbean, sea, the, caribbean, sea, is, an, oceanic, sea, on, the, caribbean, plate, the, caribbean, sea, is, separated, from, the, ocean, by, several, island, arcs, of, various, ages, the, youngest, stretches, from, the, lesser, antilles, to, the, virgin, islands, to, north, of, trinidad, and, tobago, which, is, in, the, atlantic, this, arc, was, formed, by, the, collision, of, the, south, american, plate, with, the, caribbean, plate, it, included, active, and, extinct, volcanoes, such, as, mount, pelee, the, quill, on, sint, eustatius, in, the, caribbean, netherlands, la, soufri, re, in, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, and, morne, trois, pitons, on, dominica, the, larger, islands, in, the, northern, part, of, the, sea, cuba, hispaniola, jamaica, and, puerto, rico, lie, on, an, older, island, arc, the, geological, age, of, the, caribbean, sea, is, estimated, to, be, between, 160, and, 180, million, years, and, was, formed, by, a, horizontal, fracture, that, split, the, supercontinent, called, pangea, in, the, mesozoic, era, it, is, assumed, the, proto, caribbean, basin, existed, in, the, devonian, period, and, in, the, early, carboniferous, movement, of, gondwana, to, the, north, and, its, convergence, with, the, euramerica, basin, decreased, in, size, the, next, stage, of, the, caribbean, sea, s, formation, began, in, the, triassic, powerful, rifting, led, to, the, formation, of, narrow, troughs, stretching, from, modern, newfoundland, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, s, west, coast, forming, siliciclastic, sedimentary, rocks, in, the, early, jurassic, due, to, powerful, marine, transgression, water, broke, into, the, present, area, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, creating, a, vast, shallow, pool, deep, basins, emerged, in, the, caribbean, during, the, middle, jurassic, rifting, the, emergence, of, these, basins, marked, the, beginning, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, contributed, to, the, destruction, of, pangaea, at, the, end, of, the, late, jurassic, during, the, cretaceous, the, caribbean, acquired, a, shape, close, to, today, in, the, early, paleogene, due, to, marine, regression, the, caribbean, became, separated, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, atlantic, ocean, by, the, land, of, cuba, and, haiti, the, caribbean, remained, like, this, for, most, of, the, cenozoic, until, the, holocene, when, rising, water, levels, of, the, oceans, restored, communication, with, the, atlantic, ocean, the, caribbean, s, floor, is, composed, of, sub, oceanic, sediments, of, deep, red, clay, in, the, deep, basins, and, troughs, on, continental, slopes, and, ridges, calcareous, silts, are, found, clay, minerals, have, likely, been, deposited, by, the, mainland, river, orinoco, and, the, magdalena, river, deposits, on, the, bottom, of, the, caribbean, sea,

7, 686, m, 25, 220, ft, despite, this, the, caribbean, sea, is, considered, a, relatively, shallow, sea, compared, to, other, bodies, of, water, the, pressure, of, the, south, american, plate, to, the, east, of, the, caribbean, causes, the, region, of, the, lesser, antilles, to, have, high, volcanic, activity, a, very, serious, eruption, of, mount, pel, e, in, 1902, caused, many, casualties, the, caribbean, sea, floor, is, also, home, to, two, oceanic, trenches, the, cayman, trench, and, the, puerto, rico, trench, which, put, the, area, at, a, high, risk, of, earthquakes, underwater, earthquakes, pose, a, threat, of, generating, tsunamis, which, could, have, a, devastating, effect, on, the, caribbean, islands, scientific, data, reveals, that, over, the, last, 500, years, the, area, has, seen, a, dozen, earthquakes, above, 7, 5, magnitude, most, recently, a, 7, 1, earthquake, struck, haiti, on, january, 12, 2010, the, hydrology, of, the, sea, has, a, high, level, of, homogeneity, annual, variations, in, monthly, average, water, temperatures, at, the, surface, do, not, exceed, 3, c, 5, 4, f, over, the, past, 50, years, the, caribbean, has, gone, through, three, stages, cooling, until, 1974, a, cold, phase, with, peaks, during, 1974, 1976, and, 1984, 1986, and, finally, a, warming, phase, with, an, increase, in, temperature, of, 0, 6, c, 1, 1, f, per, year, virtually, all, temperature, extremes, were, associated, with, the, phenomena, of, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, the, salinity, of, the, seawater, is, about, 3, 6, and, its, density, is, 1, 023, 5, 1,

covering, about, 50, 000, km, 2, 19, 000, sq, mi, most, of, which, are, located, off, the, caribbean, islands, and, the, central, american, coast, among, them, stands, out, the, belize, barrier, reef, with, an, area, of, 963, km, 2, 372, sq, mi, which, was, declared, a, world, heritage, site, in, 1996, it, forms, part, of, the, great, mayan, reef, also, known, as, the, mbrs, and, being, over, 1, 000, km, 600, mi, in, length, is, the, world, s, second, longest, it, runs, along, the, caribbean, coasts, of, mexico, belize, guatemala, and, honduras, since, 2005, unusually, warm, caribbean, waters, have, been, increasingly, threatening, caribbean, coral, reefs, coral, reefs, support, some, of, the, most, diverse, marine, habitats, in, the, world, but, they, are, fragile, ecosystems, when, tropical, waters, become, unusually, warm, for, extended, periods, of, time, microscopic, plants, called, zooxanthellae, which, are, symbiotic, partners, living, within, the, coral, polyp, tissues, die, off, these, plants, provide, food, for, the, corals, and, give, them, their, color, the, result, of, the, death, and, dispersal, of, these, tiny, plants, is, called, coral, bleaching, and, can, lead, to, the, devastation, of, large, areas, of, reef, over, 42, of, corals, are, completely, bleached, and, 95, are, experiencing, some, type, of, whitening, historically, the, caribbean, is, thought, to, contain, 14, of, the, world, s, coral, reefs, the, habitats, supported, by, the, reefs, are, critical, to, such, tourist, activities, as, fishing, and, diving, and, provide, an, annual, economic, value, to, caribbean, nations, of, us, 3, 1, 4, 6, billion, continued, destruction, of, the, reefs, could, severely, damage, the, region, s, economy, a, protocol, of, the, convention, for, the, protection, and, development, of, the, marine, environment, of, the, wider, caribbean, region, came, in, effect, in, 1986, to, protect, the, various, endangered, marine, life, of, the, caribbean, through, forbidding, human, activities, that, would, advance, the, continued, destruction, of, such, marine, life, in, various, areas, currently, this, protocol, has, been, ratified, by, 15, countries, also, several, charitable, organisations, have, been, formed, to, preserve, the, caribbean, marine, life, such, as, caribbean, conservation, corporation, which, seeks, to, study, and, protect, sea, turtles, while, educating, others, about, them, in, connection, with, the, foregoing, the, institute, of, marine, sciences, and, limnology, of, the, national, autonomous, university, of, mexico, conducted, a, regional, study, funded, by, the, department, of, technical, cooperation, of, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, in, which, specialists, from, 11, latin, american, countries, colombia, costa, rica, cuba, guatemala, haiti, honduras, mexico, nicaragua, panama, dominican, republic, venezuela, plus, jamaica, participated, the, findings, indicate, that, heavy, metals, such, as, mercury, arsenic, and, lead, have, been, identified, in, the, coastal, zone, of, the, caribbean, sea, analysis, of, toxic, metals, and, hydrocarbons, is, based, on, the, investigation, of, coastal, sediments, that, have, accumulated, less, than, 50, meters, deep, during, the, last, hundred, and, fifty, years, the, project, results, were, presented, in, vienna, in,

of, pollution, the, pan, american, health, organization, estimated, in, 1993, that, only, about, 10, of, the, sewage, from, the, central, american, and, caribbean, island, countries, is, properly, treated, before, being, released, into, the, sea, the, caribbean, region, supports, a, large, tourism, industry, the, caribbean, tourism, organization, calculates, that, about, 12, million, people, a, year, visit, the, area, including, in, 1991, 1992, about, 8, million, cruise, ship, tourists, tourism, based, upon, scuba, diving, and, snorkeling, on, coral, reefs, of, many, caribbean, islands, makes, a, major, contribution, to, their, economies, these, three, form, the, sss, islands, that, with, the, abc, islands, comprise, the, dutch, caribbean, of, which, the, bes, islands, are, not, direct, kingdom, constituents, but, subsumed, with, the, country, of, the, netherlands, physiographically, these, continental, islands, are, not, part, of, the, volcanic, windward, islands, arc,
