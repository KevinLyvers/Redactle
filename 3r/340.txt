the, gran, chaco, or, dry, chaco, is, a, sparsely, populated, hot, and, semiarid, lowland, tropical, dry, broadleaf, forest, natural, region, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, basin, divided, among, eastern, bolivia, western, paraguay, northern, argentina, and, a, portion, of, the, brazilian, states, of, mato, grosso, and, mato, grosso, do, sul, where, it, is, connected, with, the, pantanal, region, this, land, is, sometimes, called, the, chaco, plain, the, name, chaco, comes, from, a, word, in, quechua, an, indigenous, language, from, the, andes, and, highlands, of, south, america, the, quechua, word, chaqu, meaning, hunting, land, comes, probably, from, the, rich, variety, of, animal, life, present, throughout, the, entire, region, the, gran, chaco, is, about, 647, 500, km, 2, 250, 000, sq, mi, in, size, though, estimates, differ, it, is, located, west, of, the, paraguay, river, and, east, of, the, andes, and, is, mostly, an, alluvial, sedimentary, plain, shared, among, paraguay, bolivia, and, argentina, it, stretches, from, about, 17, to, 33, s, latitude, and, between, 65, and, 60, w, longitude, though, estimates, differ, historically, the, chaco, has, been, divided, in, three, main, parts, the, chaco, austral, or, southern, chaco, south, of, the, bermejo, river, and, inside, argentinian, territory, blending, into, the, pampa, region, in, its, southernmost, end, the, chaco, central, or, central, chaco, between, the, bermejo, and, the, pilcomayo, river, to, the, north, also, now, in, argentinian, territory, and, the, chaco, boreal, or, northern, chaco, north, of, the, pilcomayo, up, to, the, brazilian, pantanal, inside, paraguayan, territory, and, sharing, some, area, with, bolivia, locals, sometimes, divide, it, today, by, the, political, borders, giving, rise, to, the, terms, argentinian, chaco, paraguayan, chaco, and, bolivian, chaco, inside, paraguay, people, sometimes, use, the, expression, central, chaco, for, the, area, roughly, in, the, middle, of, the, chaco, boreal, where, mennonite, colonies, are, established, the, chaco, boreal, may, be, divided, in, two, closer, to, the, mountains, in, the, west, the, alto, chaco, upper, chaco, sometimes, known, as, chaco, seco, or, dry, chaco, is, very, dry, and, sparsely, vegetated, to, the, east, less, arid, conditions, combined, with, favorable, soil, characteristics, permit, a, seasonally, dry, higher, growth, thorn, tree, forest, and, further, east, still, higher, rainfall, combined, with, improperly, drained, lowland, soils, result, in, a, somewhat, swampy, plain, called, the, bajo, chaco, lower, chaco, sometimes, known, as, chaco, h, medo, humid, chaco, it, has, a, more, open, savanna, vegetation, consisting, of, palm, trees, quebracho, trees, and, tropical, high, grass, areas, with, a, wealth, of, insects, the, landscape, is, mostly, flat, and, slopes, at, a, 0, 004, degree, gradient, to, the, east, this, area, is, also, one, of, the, distinct, physiographic, provinces, of, the, parana, paraguay, plain, division, the, areas, more, hospitable, to, development, are, along, the, paraguay, bermejo, and, pilcomayo, rivers, it, is, a, great, source, of, timber, and, tannin, which, is, derived, from, the, native, quebracho, tree, special, tannin, factories, have, been, constructed, there, the, wood, of, the, palo, santo, from, the, central, chaco, is, the, source, of, oil, of, guaiac, a, fragrance, for, soap, paraguay, also, cultivates, mate, in, the, lower, part, of, the, chaco, large, tracts, of, the, central, and, northern, chaco, have, high, soil, fertility, sandy, alluvial, soils, with, elevated, levels, of, phosphorus, and, a, topography, that, is, favorable, for, agricultural, development, other, aspects, are, challenging, for, farming, a, semiarid, to, semihumid, climate, 600, 1300, mm, annual, rainfall, with, a, six, month, dry, season, and, sufficient, fresh, groundwater, restricted, to, roughly, one, third, of, the, region, two, thirds, being, without, groundwater, or, with, groundwater, of, high, salinity, soils, are, generally, erosion, prone, once, the, forest, has, been, cleared, in, the, central, and, northern, paraguay, chaco, occasional, dust, storms, have, caused, major, topsoil, loss, the, chaco, was, occupied, by, nomadic, peoples, notably, the, various, groups, making, up, the, guaycuru, who, resisted, spanish, control, of, the, chaco, often, with, success, from, the, 16th, until, the, early, 20th, centuries, prior, to, national, independence, of, the, nations, that, compose, the, chaco, the, entire, area, was, a, separate, colonial, region, named, by, the, spaniards, as, chiquitos, the, gran, chaco, had, been, a, disputed, territory, since, 1810, officially, it, was, supposed, to, be, part, of, argentina, bolivia, and, paraguay, although, a, bigger, land, portion, west, of, the, paraguay, river, had, belonged, to, paraguay, since, its, independence, argentina, claimed, territories, north, of, the, bermejo, river, until, paraguay, s, defeat, in, the, war, of, the, triple, alliance, in, 1870, established, its, current, border, with, argentina, over, the, next, few, decades, bolivia, began, to, push, the, natives, out, and, settle, in, the, gran, chaco, while, paraguay, ignored, it, bolivia, sought, the, paraguay, river, for, shipping, oil, out, into, the, sea, it, had, become, a, land, locked, country, after, the, loss, of, its, pacific, coast, in, the, war, of, the, pacific, and, paraguay, claimed, ownership, of, the, land, this, became, the, backdrop, to, the, gran, chaco, war, 1932, 1935, between, paraguay, and, bolivia, over, supposed, oil, in, the, chaco, boreal, the, aforementioned, region, north, of, the, pilcomayo, river, and, to, the, west, of, the, paraguay, river, eventually, argentine, foreign, minister, carlos, saavedra, lamas, mediated, a, ceasefire, and, subsequent, treaty, signed, in, 1938, which, gave, paraguay, three, quarters, of, the, chaco, boreal, and, gave, bolivia, a, corridor, to, the, paraguay, river, with, the, ability, to, use, the, puerto, casado, and, the, right, to, construct, their, own, port, no, oil, was, found, in, the, region, until, 2012, when, paraguayan, president, federico, franco, announced, the, discovery, of, oil, in, the, area, of, the, pirity, river, mennonites, immigrated, into, the, paraguayan, part, of, the, region, from, canada, in, the, 1920s, more, came, from, the, ussr, in, the, 1930s, and, immediately, following, world, war, ii, these, immigrants, created, some, of, the, largest, and, most, prosperous, municipalities, in, the, deep, gran, chaco, the, region, is, home, to, over, 9, million, people, divided, about, evenly, among, argentina, bolivia, and, brazil, and, including, around, 100, 000, in, paraguay, the, area, remains, relatively, underdeveloped, in, the, 1960s, the, paraguayan, authorities, constructed, the, trans, chaco, highway, and, the, argentine, national, highway, directorate, national, routes, 16, and, 81, in, an, effort, to, encourage, access, and, development, all, three, highways, extend, about, 700, km, 430, mi, from, east, to, west, and, are, now, completely, paved, as, is, a, network, of, nine, brazilian, highways, in, mato, grosso, do, sul, state, the, gran, chaco, has, some, of, the, highest,

of, the, gran, chaco, are, varied, given, the, large, geographical, span, of, the, region, the, dominant, vegetative, structure, is, xerophytic, deciduous, forests, with, multiple, layers, including, a, canopy, trees, subcanopy, shrub, layer, and, herbaceous, layer, ecosystems, include, riverine, forests, wetlands, savannas, and, cactus, stands, as, well, at, higher, elevations, of, the, eastern, zone, of, the, humid, chaco, mature, forests, transition, from, the, wet, forests, of, southern, brazil, these, woodlands, are, dominated, by, canopy, trees, such, as, handroanthus, impetiginosus, and, characterized, by, frequent, lianas, and, epiphytes, this, declines, to, seasonally, flooded, forests, at, lower, elevations, that, are, dominated, by, schinopsis, spp, a, common, plains, tree, genus, often, harvested, for, its, tannin, content, and, dense, wood, the, understory, comprises, bromeliad, and, cactus, species, as, well, as, hardy, shrubs, such, as, schinus, fasciculata, these, lower, areas, lack, lianas, but, have, abundant, epiphytic, species, such, as, tillandsia, the, river, systems, that, flow, through, the, area, such, as, the, rio, paraguay, and, rio, parana, allow, for, seasonally, flooded, semievergreen, gallery, forests, that, hold, riparian, species, such, as, tessaria, integrifolia, and, salix, humboldtiana, other, seasonally, flooded, ecosystems, of, this,

well, as, several, arboreal, cacti, species, that, distinguish, this, area, of, the, chaco, there, is, a, scrub, like, shrub, and, herbaceous, understory, on, sandy, soils, the, thick, woodlands, turn, into, savannas, where, the, aforementioned, species, prevail, as, well, as, species, such, as, jacaranda, mimosifolia, the, giant, stetsonia, coryne, found, throughout, the, western, semiarid, arid, region, becomes, very, conspicuous, in, these, sandy, savannas, various, upland, systems, of, plant, associations, occur, throughout, the, gran, chaco, the, highlands, of, the, argentinian, chaco, are, made, up, of, on, the, dry, sunny, side, up, to, 1800m, schinopsis, haenkeana, woodlands, the, cooler, side, of, the, uplands, hosts, zanthoxylum, coco, locally, referred, to, as, fagara, coco, and, schinus, molleoides, locally, referred, to, as, lithrea, molleoides, as, the, predominant, species, other, notable, species, include, bougainvillea, stipitata, and, several, species, from, the, fabaceae, the, paraguayan, uplands, have, other, woodland, slope, ecosystems, notably, those, dominated, by, anadenanthera, colubrina, on, moist, slopes, both, of, these, upland, systems, as, well, as, numerous, other, gran, chaco, areas, are, rich, with, endemism, faunal, diversity, in, the, gran, chaco, is, also, high, the, gran, chaco, has, around, 3, 400, plant, 500, bird, 150, mammal,

howler, monkeys, peccaries, deer, and, tapirs, edentate, species, including, anteaters, and, armadillos, are, readily, seen, here, as, well, being, home, to, at, least, 10, species, the, argentinian, chaco, is, the, location, of, the, peak, diversity, for, the, armadillo, including, species, such, as, the, nine, banded, armadillo, dasypus, novemcinctus, whose, range, extends, north, to, the, southern, us, and, the, southern, three, banded, armadillo, tolypeutes, matacus, the, pink, fairy, armadillo, chlamyphrous, truncatus, is, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, the, giant, armadillo, priodontes, maximus, while, not, found, in, the, eastern, humid, chaco, can, be, seen, in, the, drier, arid, chaco, of, the, west, some, other, notable, endemics, of, the, region, include, the, san, luis, tuco, tuco, ctenomys, pontifex, this, small, rodent, is, only, found, in, the, argentinian, chaco, all, of, 60, species, of, ctenomys, are, endemic, to, south, america, the, chacoan, peccary, catagonus, wagneri, locally, known, as, tauga, is, the, largest, of, the, three, peccary, species, found, in, the, area, this, species, was, thought, to, be, extinct, by, scientists, until, 1975, when, it, was, recorded, by, ralph, wetzel, due, to, the, climate, of, the, gran, chaco, herpetofauna, are, restricted, to, moist, refugia, in, various, places, throughout, the, chaco, rotting, logs,
