suggests, that, it, is, compounded, of, ou, lyma, and, pous, meaning, pure, foot, conforming, to, hesiod, s, description, of, the, earth, as, a, sort, of, footstool, for, heaven, up, from, which, rise, the, blessed, gods, according, to, robert, s, p, beekes, the, word, is, of, pre, greek, origin, and, he, speculates, that, it, originally, meant, mountain, the, word, is, also, probably, cognate, with, the, mycenean, greek, word, u, ru, pi, ja, jo, which, is, most, likely, a, term, used, to, describe, people, or, possibly, an, ethnic, group, in, homeric, greek, odyssey, 6, 42, the, variant, oulumpos, occurs, conceived, of, as, the, seat, of, the, gods, and, not, identified, with, any, specific, peak, homer, iliad, 5, 754, odyssey, 20, 103, also, appears, to, be, using, as, a,

heavenly, threshold, in, ancient, greek, religion, and, mythology, olympus, was, the, name, of, the, home, of, the, twelve, olympian, gods, this, was, conceived, of, as, a, lofty, mountaintop, and, in, all, regions, settled, by, greek, tribes, the, highest, local, elevation, tended, to, be, so, named, among, the, numerous, peaks, called, olumpos, in, antiquity, are, mountains, in, mysia, laconia, lycia, cyprus, attica, euboea, ionia, and, lesbos, and, others, thessalian, olympus, is, the, highest, peak, in, any, territory, with, greek, settlement, and, came, to, be, seen, as, the, pan, hellenic, representative, of, the, mythological, seat, of, the, gods, by, at, least, the, 5th, century, bc, as, herodotus, 1, 56, identifies, olympus, as, the, peak, in, thessaly, in, pieria, at,

war, and, the, macedonian, wars, during, the, 4th, to, 2nd, centuries, bc, in, the, period, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, mountain, was, a, hiding, place, and, base, of, operations, for, klephts, and, armatoloi, it, was, known, as, semavatevi, in, turkish, during, the, nearly, 400, years, of, ottoman, rule, in, olympus, the, second, armatoliki, was, founded, led, by, kara, michalis, in, 1489, the, action, of, the, klephts, in, olympus, led, the, turks, to, visit, their, outrage, on, the, klephts, ally, village, of, milia, in, the, late, 17th, century, which, they, destroyed, in, that, period, livadi, in, olympus, became, the, seat, of, the, armatoliki, of, olympus, and, western, macedonia, with, their, first, renowned, commander, panos, zidros, in, the, 18th, century, the, turks, had, to, replace, the, armatoloi, who, very, often, joined, the, klephts, with, muslim, albanian, armatoloi, who, ravaged, the, countryside, of, macedonia, however, olympus, s, armatoloi, even, after, their, capitulation, to, ali, pasha, never, ceased, fighting, on, land, and, at, sea, among, them, who, were, active, there, and, in, nearby, regions, were, nikotsaras, giorgakis, olympios, and, the, legendary, family, of, lazaioi, in, the, early, 20th, century, even, for, some, time, after, the, liberation, from, the, ottoman, empire, 1912, robbers, were, active, in, the, region, the, best, known, of, them, the, notorious, giagoulas, while, during, the, german, invasion, in, 1941, the, hellenic, army, fought, significant, battles, along, with, units, of, new, zealanders, and, australians, during, the, german, occupation, 1941, 1944, the, mountain, was, one, of, the, centers, of, the, greek, resistance, while, a, little, later, the, greek, civil, war, 1946, 49, started, there, in, litochoro, the, whole, region, of, pieria, s, olympus, was, declared, an, archaeological, and, historical, site, for, the, preservation, of, its, monumental, and, historical, character,

and, the, macedonian, tombs, of, katerini, and, korinos, in, the, olympus, region, there, are, also, several, christian, monuments, among, them, the, highest, elevation, chapel, of, orthodox, christianity, dedicated, to, prophet, elias, in, greek, tradition, associated, with, mountaintops, on, the, summit, of, the, same, name, profitis, ilias, at, 2, 803, m, it, was, built, in, the, 16th, century, by, saint, dionysios, of, olympus, who, also, founded, the, most, significant, monastery, in, the, region, the, old, monastery, of, dionysios, elevation, 820, m, lies, in, enipeas, gorge, and, is, accessible, by, car, from, litochoro, it, was, looted, and, burned, by, the, ottomans, and, in, 1943, it, was, destroyed, by, the, german, invaders, who, suspected, it, was, a, guerrilla, den, nowadays, it, has, been, partially, restored, and, operates, as, a, dependency, of, the, new, monastery, of, dionysios, that, is, outside, litochoro, on, olympus, s, southern, foot, in, a, dominant, position, 820, m, in, ziliana, gorge, there, is, the, kanalon, monastery, 8, km, away, from, karya, it, was, founded, in, 1055, by, the, monks, damianos, and, joakim, and, since, 2001, it, has, been, restored, and, operates, as, a, convent, further, west, in, the, edge, of, mavratza, stream, at, 1, 020, m, there, is, the, agia, triada, sparmou, monastery, that, flourished, in, the, early, 18th, century, possessed, great, property, and, assisted, to, establish, the, famous, tsaritsani, school, it, was, abandoned, in, 1932, but, in, 2000, it, was, completely, renovated, and, reopened, as, a, male, monastery, affiliated, to, elassona, s, diocese, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, mount, olympus, was, regularly, visited, in, religious, pilgrimages, through, antiquity, and, the, early, middle, ages, for, instance, ancient, greek, pottery, coins, and, evidence, of, sacrificial, ashes, estimated, to, be, from, 400, b, c, have, been, found, on, the, summit, plutarch, writing, during, the, roman, empire, reported, that, writings, and, sacrificial, ashes, left, by, priests, and, religious, pilgrims, on, the, summit, of, the, mountains, of, mount, kyllini, and, mount, olympus, could, be, found, intact, several, years, later, neither, being, washed, away, by, rains, or, scattered, by, winds, plutarch, cited, this, as, evidence, that, the, highest, mountains, on, earth, were, above, the, clouds, and, winds, augustine, of, hippo, writing, in, the, early, middle, ages, similarly, reported, in, on, genesis, that, on, the, peak, of, mount, olympus, which, is, said, to, rise, above, the, area, of, this, humid, air, we, are, told, certain, letters, are, regularly, made, in, the, dust, and, are, a, year, later, found, whole, and, unmarred, by, those, who, climb, that, mountain, for, their, solemn, memorials, the, third, highest, peak, of, mount, olympus, called, agios, antonios, saint, anthony, 40, 04, 04, n, 22, 21, 04, e, 40, 0677, n, 22, 3511, e, 40, 0677, 22, 3511, 2, 817, m, is, known, to, have, been, the, site, of, a, sanctuary, of, zeus, in, antiquity, based, on, archaeological, finds, discovered, in, 1961, in, the, modern, era, a, series, of, explorers, tried, to, study, the, mountain, and, to, reach, its, summit, examples, include, the, french, archaeologist, leon, heuzey, 1855, the, german, explorer, heinrich, barth, 1862, and, the, german, engineer, edward, richter, richter, tried, to, reach, the, summit, in, 1911, but, was, abducted, by, klephts, who, also, killed, the, ottoman, gendarmes, that, accompanied, him, it, was, just, one, year, after, the, liberation, of, northern, greece, from, ottoman, rule, on, 2, august, 1913, that, the, summit, of, olympus, was, finally, reached, the, swiss, fr, d, ric, boissonnas, and, daniel, baud, bovy, aided, by, a, hunter, of, wild, goats, from, litochoro, christos, kakkalos, were, the, first, to, reach, greece, s, highest, peak, kakkalos, who, had, much, experience, climbing, olympus, was, the, first, of, the, three, to, climb, mytikas, afterwards, and, until, his, death, in, 1976, he, was, the, official, guide, on, olympus, in, 1921, he, and, marcel, kurz, reached, the, second, highest, summit, of, olympus, stefani, based, on, these, explorations, kurz, in, 1923, edited, le, mont, olympe, a, book, that, includes, the, first, detailed, map, of, the, summits, in, 1928, the, painter, vasilis, ithakisios, climbed, olympus, together, with, kakkalos, reaching, a, cave, that, he, named, shelter, of, the, muses, and, he, spent, many, summers, painting, views, of, the, mountain, olympus, was, later, photographed, and, mapped, in, detail, by, others, and, a, series, of, successful, climbs, and, winter, ascents, of, the, steepest, summits, in, difficult, weather, conditions, took, place, climbing, mount, olympus, is, a, non, technical, hike, except, for, the, final, section, from, the, skala, summit, to, the, mytikas, peak, which, is, a, yds, class, 3, rock, scramble, and, due, to, high, exposure, to, heights, requires, resistance, to, acrophobia, it, is, estimated, that, over, 10, 000, people, visit, mount, olympus, each, year, most, of, them, reaching, only, the, skala, and, skolio, summits, most, climbs, of, mount, olympus, start, from, the, town, of, litochoro, which, took, the, name, city, of, gods, because, of, its, location, at, the, foot, of, the, mountain, from, there, a, road, goes, to, prionia, where, the, hike, begins, at, the, bottom, of, the, mountain, generally, speaking, olympus, s, climate, can, be, described, as, mediterranean, with, continental, influence, its, local, variations, are, the, result, of, the, impact, of, the, sea, and, the, rugged, terrain, of, the, region, in, the, lower, locations, litochoro, and, the, foothills, the, climate, is, typically, mediterranean, i, e, hot, and, dry, in, the, summer, but, humid, and, cold, in, the, winter, higher, it, is, more, humid, warm, and, sometimes, severe, with, more, intense, meteorological, phenomena, in, these, locations, it, often, snows, throughout, winter, while, rain, and, snow, is, not, unusual, even, in, the, summer, the, temperature, varies, in, winter, from, 10, c, to, 10, c, and, in, summer, from, 0, c, to, 20, c, while, winds, are, an, almost, daily, occurrence, generally, the, temperature, falls, 1, c, per, 200, m, of, elevation, as, the, elevation, rises, meteorological, phenomena, are, more, intense, and, the, changes, in, temperature, and, humidity, are, often, sudden, the, coastal, northeast, slopes, of, olympus, receive, more, rain, than, the, continental, northwest, so, as, a, result, there, is, a, clear, difference, in, vegetation, being, more, abundant, in, the, first, of, them, the, hottest, month, is, august, while, the, coldest, is, february, the, mountain, s, highest, zone, over, 2, 000, metres, is, snowcapped, for, about, nine, months, september, to, may, in, some, places, the, winds, gather, snow, 8, 10, metres, thick, anemosouria, in, greek, while, in, some, deep, ravines, the, snow, is, maintained, all, over, the, year, everlasting, snow, for, this, olympus, s, alpine, region, recordings, have, been, made, in, the, 1960s, in, the, highest, elevation, weather, station, in, greece, that, was, established, on, the, summit, of, aghios, antonios, 2, 815, m, providing, a, number, of, interesting, data, for, the, mountain, s, climate, the, average, temperature, is, 5, c, in, winter, and, 10, c, in, summer, the, average, annual, precipitation, heights, vary, from, 149, cm, at, prionia, 1, 100, m, to, 170, cm, at, aghios, antonios, about, half, of, them, rainfall, and, hailstorms, in, summer, and, the, rest, snowfall, in, winter, the, weather, may, change, several, times, in, the, same, day, in, summer, rainfalls, are, frequent, commonly, as, evening, thunderstorms, many, times, accompanied, by, hail, and, strong, winds, however, water, springs, over, 2, 000, metres, are, scarce, and, visitors, should, ensure, that, they, have, always, water, and, of, course, the, necessary, clothing, for, any, weather, conditions, the, research, of, olympus, s, plants, started, in, 1836, when, the, french, botanist, aucher, loy, studied, them, according, to, this, and, later, studies, the, national, park, of, olympus, is, considered, one, of, the, richest, flora, regions, in, greece, with, about, 1, 700, species, and, subspecies, that, represent, some, 25, of, greek, flora, of, them, 187, are, characterized, as, significant, 56, are, greek, endemic, and, of, them, 23, are, local, endemic, i, e, they, can, be, found, only, in, olympus, and, 16, are, rare, in, greece, or, and, have, there, the, limits, of, their, spread, within, northern, greece, an, important, book, about, the, plants, and, flowers, from, the, beach, of, the, aegean, sea, up, to, the, upper, regions, of, mount, olympus, was, written, in, 1980, by, the, swedish, botanist, arne, strid, most, of, those, found, in, lower, elevation, are, the, common, mediterranean, and, central, european, species, ramonda, heldreichii, syn, jankaea, heldreichii, a, plant, relict, of, the, ice, age, is, of, particular, interest, to, botanists, the, intense, diversity, of, the, landscape, the, varying, orientation, of, the, slopes, and, their, position, in, relation, to, the, sea, affect, locally, olympus, s, climate, and, so, a, local, microclimate, prevails, combined, with, the, geological, background, and, the, soil, favor, the, growth, of, particular, vegetation, types, and, biotopes, generally, olympus, s, northeast, side, is, densely, forested, as, it, receives, the, most, rainfall, while, the, southwest, one, has, significantly, sparser, vegetation, in, olympus, there, are, generally, four, sequential, flora, zones, but, due, to, the, complex, topography, and, variety, of, microclimates, these, do, not, form, an, obvious, clear, sequence, with, elevation, a, zone, of, evergreen, broadleaf, trees, maquis, occurs, between, 300, and, 500, metres, elevation, along, with, oak, quercus, ilex, and, greek, strawberry, tree, there, occur, kermes, oak, strawberry, tree, phillyrea, latifolia, bay, laurel, cedar, and, others, of, the, deciduous, species, most, common, are, fraxinus, ulmus, montpellier, maple, judas, tree, terebinth, cotinus, coggygria, and, others, the, evergreen, broadleaf, trees, zone, is, gradually, replaced, by, ecosystems, of, european, black, pine, that, forms, compact, clusters, with, no, intermediate, zone, of, deciduous, oaks, although, trees, of, these, species, occur, sporadically, within, clusters, of, black, pine, on, the, northern, slopes, of, xirolakos, valley, between, 600, and, 700, metres, elevation, there, is, a, high, forest, of, downy, oak, of, about, 120, hectares, the, black, pine, dominates, on, the, eastern, and, northern, side, of, the, mountain, between, 500, and, 1, 700, metres, in, this, zone, there, is, also, hybrid, fir, in, small, groups, and, scrubs, or, small, clumps, particularly, in, the, lower, region, and, in, the, sites, naoumi, west, and, stalamatia, and, polykastro, east, where, it, is, mixed, with, black, pine, and, bosnian, pine, in, this, zone, there, is, also, beech, while, in, the, neighboring, mountains, pierians, and, ossa, it, creates, an, extended, vegetation, zone, in,
