steeped, in, latin, culture, unlike, the, north, of, france, justice, followed, written, roman, law, and, the, nobles, were, highly, educated, this, was, the, time, of, the, troubadours, who, wrote, their, poetry, in, occitan, called, proven, al, at, the, time, then, one, of, the, most, sophisticated, languages, in, europe, like, the, other, great, lords, of, the, midi, the, counts, of, toulouse, maintained, and, favoured, these, poets, this, is, how, count, raymond, v, employed, for, some, time, the, famous, bernard, de, ventadour, expert, in, singing, courtly, love, in, 1096, raymond, iv, count, of, toulouse, left, with, his, army, at, the, call, of, the, pope, urban, ii, to, join, the, first, crusade, of, which, he, was, one, of, the, main, leaders, this, exodus, of, its, warriors, and, nobles, reinforced, by, the, creation, of, the, faraway, county, of, tripoli, by, raymond, iv, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, weakened, the, city, militarily, as, well, as, the, ascendancy, that, its, counts, had, over, it, the, duke, william, ix, of, aquitaine, challenged, the, possession, of, the, city, on, the, grounds, that, it, should, have, been, inherited, by, his, wife, philippa, daughter, of, the, previous, count, of, toulouse, whereas, raymond, iv, was, only, his, brother, more, than, 50, years, later, his, granddaughter, eleanor, of, aquitaine, still, claimed, the, inheritance, in, vain, in, the, 12th, century, the, city, left, its, roman, limits, and, a, new, district, developed, around, the, church, of, saint, sernin, the, bourg, the, church, of, saint, sernin, was, famous, and, revered, for, its, many, relics, and, the, chapter, of, its, canons, which, had, possessions, as, far, away, as, spain, was, powerful, enough, to, free, itself, from, the, control, of, the, bishop, of, toulouse, this, dissent, had, important, local, political, repercussions, making, the, bourg, in, practice, a, separate, district, from, the, city, in, 1152, the, notables, of, toulouse, took, advantage, of, a, weakening, of, the, county, power, to, obtain, for, their, city, a, great, autonomy, they, created, a, municipal, body, of, consuls, called, capitouls, in, toulouse, to, lead, the, city, the, bourg, which, had, only, a, quarter, of, the, inhabitants, of, toulouse, obtained, as, many, capitouls, as, the, rest, of, the, city, economically, toulouse, which, was, at, the, center, of, a, large, cereal, growing, plain, was, distinguished, by, its, numerous, mills, that, took, advantage, of, the, force, of, the, garonne, among, which, the, bazacle, milling, company, was, the, first, recorded, european, joint, stock, company, at, the, beginning, of, the, thirteenth, century, the, county, of, toulouse, was, caught, up, in, another, crusade, that, would, last, twenty, years, 1209, 1229, of, which, it, was, the, target, this, time, the, reason, for, this, was, the, development, of, catharism, in, the, south, of, france, which, the, pope, innocent, iii, wanted, to, eradicate, by, all, possible, means, after, an, initial, victory, of, the, crusaders, led, by, simon, de, montfort, who, defeated, the, combined, forces, of, count, raymond, vi, of, toulouse, and, king, peter, ii, of, aragon, at, the, battle, of, muret, the, following, years, saw, the, fate, of, the, county, of, toulouse, swing, alternately, in, favour, of, one, party, or, the, other, finally, a, late, intervention, by, king, louis, viii, of, france, in, 1226, tipped, the, balance, in, favour, of, the, crusaders, resulting, in, the, submission, of, count, raymond, vii, to, the, french, crown, and, the, end, of, the, independence, of, the, county, of, toulouse, but, beyond, the, military, crusade, this, struggle, took, on, several, important, aspects, for, the, city, of, toulouse, in, 1271, joan, of, toulouse, and, her, husband, alphonse, of, poitiers, died, without, heirs, toulouse, which, since, the, treaty, of, 1229, had, been, subordinate, to, the, kingdom, of, france, no, longer, had, a, count, and, was, annexed, to, the, royal, domain, the, installation, of, numerous, royal, officers, and, the, development, of, trade, and, crafts, which, favoured, the, social, ascension, of, merchants, renewed, the, city, s, elites, in, 1298, king, philip, the, fair, greatly, facilitated, the, possibility, of, ennobling, the, capitouls, whose, council, renewed, every, year, was, increasingly, made, up, of, rich, merchants, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, was, a, prosperous, period, despite, the, dismemberment, in, 1317, of, the, very, large, bishopric, of, toulouse, which, lost, two, thirds, of, its, area, and, a, large, part, of, its, income, a, loss, only, partially, compensated, by, its, elevation, to, the, rank, of, archbishopric, and, the, episode, of, the, shepherds, crusade, which, brought, a, pogrom, against, toulouse, s, jewish, population, in, 1320, in, 1335, toulouse, had, between, 35, 000, and, 40, 000, inhabitants, in, 1323, the, consistori, del, gay, saber, was, created, in, toulouse, to, preserve, the, lyric, art, of, the, troubadours, by, organizing, a, poetry, contest, and, toulouse, became, the, centre, of, occitan, literary, culture, for, the, following, centuries, the, consistori, is, considered, to, be, the, oldest, literary, society, in, europe, at, the, origin, of, one, of, the, most, sophisticated, treatise, on, grammar, and, rhetoric, of, the, middle, ages, and, in, 1694, it, was, transformed, into, the, royal, academy, of, the, floral, games, acad, mie, des, jeux, floraux, still, active, today, by, king, louis, xiv, the, 14th, century, also, saw, a, significant, increase, in, the, influence, of, the, university, of, toulouse, particularly, following, the, move, of, the, papacy, from, rome, to, avignon, many, law, graduates, from, the, university, of, toulouse, had, brilliant, careers, in, the, avignon, curia, several, became, cardinals, and, three, became, popes, john, xxii, innocent, vi, and, urban, v, these, powerful, prelates, financed, the, establishment, of, colleges, in, the, university, towns, of, southern, france, not, only, toulouse, but, also, montpellier, cahors, and, avignon, the, black, death, in, 1348, then, the, hundred, years, war, caused, a, major, crisis, that, lasted, until, the, following, century, despite, strong, immigration, the, population, lost, more, than, 10, 000, inhabitants, in, 70, years, by, 1405, toulouse, had, only, 19, 000, people, in, these, hardships, the, city, was, the, key, stronghold, of, the, french, defence, in, the, south, of, france, during, the, worst, years, of, the, hundred, years, war, when, the, english, troops, from, aquitaine, had, taken, montauban, and, only, toulouse, remained, as, an, obstacle, to, their, conquest, of, southern, france, this, military, threat, to, the, city, and, especially, to, the, surrounding, countryside, was, not, conducive, to, its, development, despite, the, strengthening, of, ties, with, the, royalty, that, it, entailed, in, 1369, pope, urban, v, attributed, to, the, dominican, church, of, the, jacobins, of, toulouse, the, bones, of, the, dominican,

use, of, brick, in, buildings, rather, than, excessively, flammable, wood, or, cob, in, the, 16th, century, and, until, 1562, the, economy, of, toulouse, experienced, a, golden, age, its, parliament, made, it, the, judicial, capital, of, a, large, part, of, southern, france, and, the, city, became, the, first, european, centre, for, the, trade, in, woad, the, only, blue, dye, then, known, in, europe, which, was, very, much, in, demand, in, the, textile, industry, at, the, time, its, humanist, milieu, developed, thanks, to, its, university, and, parliament, which, trained, and, attracted, intellectual, elites, the, wealth, generated, by, this, culturally, and, economically, dynamic, environment, is, the, source, of, the, superb, renaissance, mansions, in, toulouse, in, 1550, the, population, of, the, city, made, it, the, second, or, third, largest, city, in, france, it, was, estimated, to, have, 50, 000, inhabitants, a, figure, it, would, not, regain, until, the, 18th, century, in, 1562, the, french, wars, of, religion, began, and, toulouse, became, an, ultra, catholic, stronghold, in, a, predominantly, protestant, region, the, era, of, economic, prosperity, came,

construction, works, of, the, 17th, century, completed, in, 1681, the, canal, stimulated, the, economy, of, toulouse, by, promoting, the, export, of, cereals, and, the, import, of, olive, oil, wine, and, other, goods, from, the, mediterranean, regions, in, the, 18th, century, toulouse, was, a, provincial, capital, that, prided, itself, on, its, royal, academies, the, only, city, in, france, along, with, paris, to, have, three, royal, academies, but, sometimes, seemed, far, removed, from, the, debates, of, ideas, that, agitated, the, enlightenment, a, famous, example, illustrates, this, backwardness, of, toulouse, mentalities, of, the, time, in, 1762, its, powerful, parliament, sentenced, jean, calas, to, death, the, philosopher, voltaire, then, accused, the, parlement, of, toulouse, of, religious, intolerance, calas, was, a, protestant, gave, the, affair, a, european, repercussion, and, succeeded, in, having, the, judgment, of, the, parliament, quashed, by, the, king, s, council, which, did, much, damage, to, the, reputation, of, the, parliament, it, was, on, this, occasion, that, voltaire, published, one, of, his, major, philosophical, works, his, famous, treatise, on, tolerance, with, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, and, the, reform, or, suppression, of, all, royal, institutions, toulouse, lost, much, of, its, power, and, influence, until, then, the, capital, of, the, vast, province, of, languedoc, with, a, parliament, ruling, over, an, even, larger, territory, the, city, then, found, itself, simply, at, the, head, of, the, single, small, department, of, haute, garonne, on, 10, april, 1814, four, days, after, napoleon, s, surrender, of, the, french, empire, to, the, nations, of, the, sixth, coalition, a, fact, that, the, two, armies, involved, were,

they, managed, to, resist, were, forced, to, withdraw, toulouse, was, thus, the, scene, of, the, last, franco, british, battle, on, french, territory, unlike, most, large, french, cities, there, was,

mainly, enclosed, within, the, 220, hectares, of, the, city, s, inner, boulevard, one, of, the, largest, protected, urban, areas, in, france, almost, all, the, buildings, of, the, historical, centre, were, made, with, the, traditional, building, material, of, the, region, the, foraine, brick, that, has, earned, the, city, the, nickname, of, ville, rose, pink, city, medieval, heir, to, the, roman, brick, the, foraine, brick, is, characterised, by, its, large, dimensions, its, flat, appearance, and, its, colour, ranging, from, orange, pink, to, red, white, stone, is, also, present, in, smaller, quantities, as, there, were, no, stone, quarries, near, toulouse, it, was, transported, from, the, pyrenees, via, the, garonne, river, and, was, for, a, long, time, rare, and, therefore, expensive, considered, in, toulouse, as, a, luxury, material, however, it, is, enough, to, give, toulouse, s, architecture, one, of, its, characteristics, red, white, polychromy, the, romanesque, architecture, of, toulouse, is, largely, dominated, by, the, presence, of, the, basilica, of, saint, sernin, one, of, the, most, important, churches, of, its, time, in, europe, and, fortunate, enough, to, keep, its, romanesque, character, virtually, intact, basilica, of, saint, sernin, part, of, the, way, of, saint, james, unesco, world, heritage, site, was, also, in, itself, a, major, place, of, pilgrimage, it, is, one, of, the, two, largest, surviving, romanesque, churches, in, europe, with, more, than, two, hundred, relics, including, that, of, saint, saturnin, who, gave, his, name, to, the, church, many, of, which, were, donated, by, charlemagne, to, the, shrine, that, preceded, the, present, church, saint, sernin, is, the, church, with, the, most, relics, after, saint, peter, of, rome, conceived, from, the, outset, as, a, gigantic, reliquary, the, church, was, mainly, built, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, to, welcome, the, crowds, of, pilgrims, its, double, sided, aisles, and, the, ambulatory, surrounding, the, apse, make, it, the, archetype, of, the, great, pilgrimage, church, where, pilgrims, could, make, the, circuit, around, the, church, and, were, able, to, stop, for, meditation, and, prayer, at, the, apsidal, chapels, of, the, transept, and, the, radiating, chapels, of, the, choir, the, church, is, also, particularly, noteworthy, for, the, quality, of, its, romanesque, sculptures, including, numerous, capitals, and, the, historiated, tympanum, of, the, mi, geville, gate, one, of, the, first, of, its, kind, at, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, the, catholic, clergy, of, the, south, of, france, seeing, a, growing, number, of, the, faithful, turning, to, the, catharism, which, advocated, a, more, pious, austerity, showed, the, will, to, correct, the, defects, of, the, catholic, church, which, indulged, in, luxury, under, the, impulse, of, the, bishop, of, toulouse, foulques, an, austere, and, militant, architectural, style, was, born, with, the, reconstruction, of, the, cathedral, of, toulouse, the, southern, french, gothic, conceived, according, to, an, ideal, of, poverty, and, humility, to, bring, the, faithful, together, in, a, single, vast, nave, to, facilitate, preaching, this, architectural, style, then, developed, during, the, 13th, century, in, the, grand, mendicant, convents, of, the, city, before, spreading, in, the, 14th, century, to, a, large, number, of, churches, and, cathedrals, in, the, region, several, churches, or, convents, in, toulouse, belong, to, this, architectural, trend, but, two, of, them, are, particularly, symbolic, and, remarkable, toulouse, has, preserved, about, thirty, gothic, stair, towers, plus, a, dozen, renaissance, or, later, towers, the, remains, of, private, mansions, called, h, tels, particuliers, from, the, middle, ages, and, the, early, 16th, century, often, hidden, in, courtyards, some, of, these, towers, are, high, enough, to, exceed, their, function, of, serving, the, floors, and, display, the, ambition, of, their, owners, at, a, time, when, most, of, the, houses, in, toulouse, were, built, in, wood, or, cob, the, brick, construction, of, these, towers, and, h, tels, also, testifies, to, their, quality, in, the, 16th, century, toulouse, experienced, a, golden, age, coinciding, with, the, renaissance, in, france, the, woad, trade, pastel, brought, merchants, of, international, stature, to, the, city, and, the, parlement, of, toulouse, made, the, city, the, judicial, capital, of, a, large, part, of, the, south, of, france, these, wealthy, elites, had, private, mansions, built, remarkable, for, their, architecture, inspired, by, architectural, treatises, such, as, those, of, serlio, alberti, or, vitruvius, but, also, by, the, royal, castles, of, the, loire, valley, and, the, le, de, france, renowned, for, the, quality, of, their, architecture, the, private, mansions, of, the, toulouse, renaissance, that, have, survived, to, the, present, day, were, built, over, more, than, a, century, around, 1515, 1620, by, reputed, architects, such, as, louis, privat, nicolas, bachelier, dominique, bachelier, or, pierre, souffron, the, most, famous, of, these, h, tels, are, those, of, ass, zat, bernuy, vieux, raisin, or, clary, the, french, wars, of, religion, which, started, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, brought, to, the, city, many, religious, orders, who, came, to, seek, asylum, in, this, solid, catholic, bastion, they, had, baroque, churches, built, in, the, 17th, century, among, them, the, order, of, carthusians, expelled, by, the, protestants, from, the, region, of, castres, founded, the, church, of, saint, pierre, des, chartreux, the, order, of, the, discalced, carmelites, built, the, church, of, saint, exup, re, the, blue, penitents, founded, the, church, of, saint, j, r, me, and, the, order, of, carmelite, nuns, created, a, convent, of, which, a, remarkable, painted, chapel, remains, after, the, renaissance, the, decorations, in, civil, architecture, became, less, numerous, and, ostentatious, due, to, the, importance, given, to, the, moderation, of, the, architectural, structures, and, the, development, of, interior, decorations, the, play, of, colours, between, brick, and, stone, and, reliefs, bossing, were, less, costly, and, nevertheless, effective, solutions, for, livening, up, facades, the, 17th, century, is, the, century, that, gave, toulouse, the, largest, number, of, its, private, mansions, most, of, them, built, by, members, of, parliament, in, the, 18th, century, toulouse, made, its, living, from, its, parliament, and, from, the, wheat, and, corn, trade, which, was, boosted, by, the, creation, of, the, canal, du, midi, at, the, end, of, the, previous, century, among, the, major, architectural, achievements, the, most, notable, were, undoubtedly, the, construction, of, the, quays, of, the, garonne, and, the, new, facade, of, the, capitole, 1750, 1760, designed, by, architect, guillaume, cammas, in, the, last, third, of, the, 18th, century, the, ever, increasing, influence, of, the, parisian, model, meant, that, red, brick, was, no, longer, popular, the, city, facades, were, then, whitewashed, to, imitate, stone, this, is, why, nowadays, even, though, the, white, paint, has, generally, been, removed, there, are, walls, with, deep, grooves, carved, in, brick, to, imitate, ashlar, architecture, toulouse, s, 19th, century, architecture, can, be, divided, into, three, periods, which, sometimes, overlapped, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, at, the, instigation, of, architect, jacques, pascal, virebent, the, main, architecturally, unified, squares, were, created, the, place, du, capitole, and, the, place, wilson, called, place, villeneuve, when, it, was, built, whose, uniform, architecture, was, inspired, by, rue, de, rivoli, in, paris, from, 1830, onwards, auguste, virebent, and, his, brothers, sons, of, jacques, pascal, developed, a, factory, of, low, cost, moulded, decorations, which, met, with, great, success, and, adorned, toulouse, facades, with, numerous, terracotta, ornaments, far, from, the, austere, architecture, of, their, father, then, in, the, last, third, of, the, 19th, century, large, haussmann, style, avenues, were, opened, in, the, town, centre, such, as, the, central, alsace, lorraine, street, built, in, yellow, brick, to, imitate, parisian, stone, from, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, arrival, of, the, railway, in, toulouse, facilitated, the, supply, of, stone, and, made, it, cheaper, for, construction, and, architects, did, not, hesitate, to, play, on, the, old, traditional, toulouse, codes, linked, to, the, prestige, of, stone, construction, even, if, these, no, longer, had, the, economic, justification, of, yesteryear, thus, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, main, railway, station, was, built, entirely, in, white, stone, subsequently, concrete, replaced, the, traditional, materials, but, brick, and, stone, were, still, used, for, cladding, as, shown, recently, by, the, work, of, prestigious, architects, such, as, robert, venturi, and, denise, scott, brown, for, the, seat, of, the, departmental, council, or, shelley, mcnamara, and, yvonne, farrell, for, the,

time, removing, the, housing, on, the, deck, and, using, techniques, such, as, lowered, arches, openings, in, the, piers, and, stacked, spouts, to, spread, the, water, making, it, the, only, bridge,
