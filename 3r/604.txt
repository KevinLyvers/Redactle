is, derived, from, a, local, term, of, uncertain, origin, regarding, the, islands, of, new, guinea, the, portuguese, captain, and, geographer, ant, nio, galv, o, wrote, that, the, people, of, all, these, islands, are, blacke, and, have, their, haire, frisled, whom, the, people, of, maluco, do, call, papuas, new, guinea, nueva, guinea, was, the, name, coined, by, the, spanish, explorer, y, igo, ortiz, de, retez, in, 1545, he, noted, the, resemblance, of, the, people, to, those, he, had, earlier, seen, along, the, guinea, coast, of, africa, guinea, in, its, turn, is, etymologically, derived, from, the, portuguese, word, guin, the, name, is, one, of, several, toponyms, sharing, similar, etymologies, ultimately, meaning, land, of, the, blacks, or, similar, meanings, in, reference, to, the, dark, skin, of, the, inhabitants, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, humans, first, arrived, in, papua, new, guinea, around, 42, 000, to, 45, 000, years, ago, they, were, descendants, of, migrants, out, of, africa, in, one, of, the, early, waves, of, human, migration, a, 2016, study, at, the, university, of, cambridge, by, christopher, klein, et, al, suggests, that, it, was, about, 50, 000, years, ago, that, these, peoples, reached, sahul, the, paleocontinent, consisting, of, present, day, australia, and, new, guinea, the, sea, levels, rose, and, isolated, new, guinea, about, 10, 000, years, ago, but, aboriginal, australians, and, papuans, diverged, from, each, other, genetically, earlier, about, 37, 000, years, bp, evolutionary, geneticist, svante, p, bo, found, that, people, of, new, guinea, share, 4, 7, of, their, genome, with, the, denisovans, indicating, that, the, ancestors, of, papuans, interbred, in, asia, with, these, archaic, hominins, agriculture, was, independently, developed, in, the, new, guinea, highlands, around, 7000, bc, making, it, one, of, the, few, areas, in, the, world, where, people, independently, domesticated, plants, a, major, migration, of, austronesian, speaking, peoples, to, coastal, regions, of, new, guinea, took, place, around, 500, bc, this, has, been, correlated, with, the, introduction, of, pottery, pigs, and, certain, fishing, techniques, in, the, 18th, century, traders, brought, the, sweet, potato, to, new, guinea, where, it, was, adopted, and, became, a, staple, food, portuguese, traders, had, obtained, it, from, south, america, and, introduced, it, to, the, moluccas, the, far, higher, crop, yields, from, sweet, potato, radically, transformed, traditional, agriculture, and, societies, sweet, potato, largely, supplanted, the, previous, staple, taro, and, resulted, in, a, significant, increase, in, population, in, the, highlands, although, by, the, late, 20th, century, headhunting, and, cannibalism, had, been, practically, eradicated, in, the, past, they, were, practised, in, many, parts, of, the, country, as, part, of, rituals, related, to, warfare, and, taking, in, enemy, spirits, or, powers, in, 1901, on, goaribari, island, in, the, gulf, of, papua, missionary, harry, dauncey, found, 10, 000, skulls, in, the, island, s, long, houses, a, demonstration, of, past, practices, according, to, marianna, torgovnick, writing, in, 1991, the, most, fully, documented, instances, of, cannibalism, as, a, social, institution, come, from, new, guinea, where, head, hunting, and, ritual, cannibalism, survived, in, certain, isolated, areas, into, the, fifties, sixties, and, seventies, and, still, leave, traces, within, certain, social, groups, little, was, known, in, europe, about, the, island, until, the, 19th, century, although, portuguese, and, spanish, explorers, such, as, dom, jorge, de, menezes, and, y, igo, ortiz, de, retez, had, encountered, it, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, traders, from, southeast, asia, visited, new, guinea, beginning, 5, 000, years, ago, to, collect, bird, of, paradise, plumes, christianity, was, introduced, to, new, guinea, on, 15, september, 1847, when, a, group, of, marist, missionaries, came, to, woodlark, island, they, established, their, first, mission, on, umboi, island, following, that, year, they, were, forced, to, withdraw, their, mission, endeavour, five, years, later, on, 8, october, 1852, the, pontifical, institute, for, foreign, missions, a, pontifical, institute, reestablished, the, mission, on, woodlark, island, encountering, sickness, and, resistance, from, local, people, the, country, s, dual, name, results, from, its, complex, administrative, history, before, independence, beginning, in, 1884, the, region, was, split, between, two, colonial, powers, germany, ruled, the, northern, half, of, the, country, for, several, decades, as, a, colony, named, german, new, guinea, while, the, southern, part, of, the, country, became, a, british, protectorate, in, 1888, the, british, protectorate, as, well, as, some, adjacent, islands, were, annexed, by, britain, as, british, new, guinea, in, 1902, papua, was, effectively, transferred, to, the, authority, of, the, new, british, dominion, of, australia, with, the, passage, of, the, papua, act, 1905, the, area, was, officially, renamed, the, territory, of, papua, and, the, australian, administration, became, formal, in, 1906, following, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, australian, forces, captured, german, new, guinea, and, occupied, it, throughout, the, war, after, germany, and, the, central, powers, were, defeated, in, the, war, the, league, of, nations, authorised, australia, to, administer, this, area, as, a, league, of, nations, mandate, territory, which, became, the, territory, of, new, guinea, in, contrast, to, establishing, an, australian, mandate, in, former, german, new, guinea, the, league, of, nations, determined, that, papua, was, an, external, territory, of, the, australian, commonwealth, as, a, matter, of, law, it, remained, a, british, possession, the, difference, in, legal, status, meant, that, until, 1949, papua, former, british, protectorate, territory, of, papua, and, new, guinea, former, german, territory, german, new, guinea, had, entirely, separate, administrations, both, controlled, by, australia, these, conditions, contributed, to, the, complexity, of, organising, the, country, s, post, independence, legal, system, the, highland, valleys, were, first, explored, by, australians, in, the, 1930s, and, were, found, to, be, inhabited, by, over, a, million, people, during, world, war, ii, the, new, guinea, campaign, 1942, 1945, was, one, of, the, major, military, campaigns, and,

five, years, after, the, previous, national, election, in, the, early, years, of, independence, the, instability, of, the, party, system, led, to, frequent, votes, of, no, confidence, in, parliament,

customary, title, by, traditional, landowners, the, precise, nature, of, the, seisin, varies, from, one, culture, to, another, many, writers, portray, land, as, the, communal, ownership, of, traditional, clans, however, closer, studies, usually, show, that, the, smallest, portions, of, land, whose, ownership, cannot, be, further, divided, are, held, by, the, individual, heads, of, extended, families, and, their, descendants, or, their, descendants, alone, if, they, have, recently, died, this, is, a, matter, of, vital, importance, because, a, problem, of, economic, development, is, identifying, the, membership, of, customary, landowning, groups, and, the, owners, disputes, between, mining, and, forestry, companies, and, landowner, groups, often, devolve, on, the, issue, of,

their, land, if, they, seek, to, develop, it, for, urban, or, rural, economic, activities, the, land, group, incorporation, act, requires, more, specific, identification, of, the, customary, landowners, than, hitherto, and, their, more, specific, authorisation, before, any, land, arrangements, are, determined, a, major, issue, in, recent, years, has, been, a, land, grab, using, or,
