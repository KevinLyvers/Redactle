ellesmere, island, inuktitut, romanized, umingmak, nuna, lit, land, of, muskoxen, french, le, d, ellesmere, is, canada, s, northernmost, and, third, largest, island, and, the, tenth, largest, in, the, world, it, comprises, an, area, of, 196, 236, km, 2, 75, 767, sq, mi, slightly, smaller, than, great, britain, and, the, total, length, of, the, island, is, 830, km, 520, mi, lying, within, the, arctic, archipelago, ellesmere, island, is, considered, part, of, the, queen, elizabeth, islands, cape, columbia, at, 83, 06, 41, n, 069, 57, 13, w, 83, 11139, n, 69, 95361, w, 83, 11139, 69, 95361, cape, columbia, is, the, most, northerly, point, of, land, in, canada, and, one, of, the, most, northern, points, of, land, on, the, planet, the, most, northerly, point, of, land, on, earth, is, the, nearby, kaffeklubben, island, of, greenland, the, arctic, cordillera, mountain, system, covers, much, of, ellesmere, island, making, it, the, most, mountainous, in, the, arctic, archipelago, more, than, one, fifth, of, the, island, is, protected, as, quttinirpaaq, national, park, in, 2021, the, population, of, ellesmere, island, was, recorded, at, 144, there, are, three, settlements, alert, eureka, and, grise, fiord, ellesmere, island, is, administered, as, part, of, the, qikiqtaaluk, region, in, the, canadian, territory, of, nunavut, ellesmere, island, has, three, major, geological, regions, the, grant, land, highlands, is, a, large, belt, of, fold, mountains, which, dominate, the, northern, face, of, the, island, it, is, part, of, the, franklinian, mobile, belt, a, zone, of, cretaceous, volcanic, and, intrusive, rock, south, of, this, is, the, greely, hazen, plateau, a, large, tableland, composed, of, sedimentary, and, volcanic, rocks, covering, most, of, the, island, the, coastal, sedimentary, plateau, is, a, succession, of, highly, eroded, sedimentary, peaks, which, are, part, of, the, franklinian, shield, with, an, extension, of, the, canadian, shield, precambrian, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, in, the, island, s, southeastern, corner, in, addition, there, are, syntectonic, clastics, which, comprise, the, ellesmere, island, volcanics, of, the, sverdrup, basin, magmatic, province, 12, 14, a, period, of, uplift, and, faulting, prior, to, the, pleistocene, epoch, 2, 6, ma, established, the, overall, features, of, the, island, additional, uplift, occurred, due, to, isostatic, rebound, following, the, last, glacial, period, land, features, were, then, shaped, by, erosion, from, glacial, ice, meltwaters, and, scouring, by, sea, ice, 12, it, is, believed, that, each, of, the, pre, contact, peoples, who, migrated, through, the, high, arctic, approached, ellesmere, island, from, the, south, and, west, they, were, able, to, travel, along, ellesmere, s, coasts, or, overland, to, nares, strait, and, some, of, them, crossed, the, strait, to, populate, greenland, 9, 11, the, archaeological, record, of, past, arctic, cultures, is, quite, complete, as, artefacts, deteriorate, very, slowly, items, exposed, to, the, cold, dry, winds, become, naturally, freeze, dried, while, items, that, become, buried, are, preserved, in, the, permafrost, artefacts, are, in, a, similar, condition, to, when, they, were, left, or, lost, and, settlements, abandoned, thousands, of, years, ago, can, be, seen, much, as, they, were, the, day, their, inhabitants, left, from, these, sites, and, artefacts, archaeologists, have, been, able, to, construct, a, history, of, these, cultures, 8, however, the, research, is, incomplete, and, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, details, of, excavations, have, been, published, 72, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, peoples, a, k, a, paleo, eskimos, in, the, high, arctic, had, small, populations, organized, as, hunting, bands, spread, from, axel, heiberg, island, to, the, northern, extremity, of, greenland, 49, where, the, independence, i, culture, was, active, from, 2700, bce, 28, on, ellesmere, they, chiefly, hunted, in, the, eureka, upland, and, the, hazen, plateau, six, different, small, tool, cultures, have, been, identified, at, the, smith, sound, region, independence, i, independence, i, saqqaq, pre, dorset, saqqaq, early, dorset, and, late, dorset, 49, they, chiefly, hunted, muskoxen, more, than, three, quarters, of, their, known, archeological, sites, on, ellesmere, are, located, in, the, island, s, interior, and, their, winter, dwellings, were, skin, tents, suggesting, a, need, for, mobility, to, follow, the, herds, there, is, evidence, at, lake, hazen, of, a, trade, network, c, 1500, 1000, bce, including, soapstone, lamps, from, greenland, and, incised, lance, heads, from, cultures, to, the, south, 50, the, thule, moved, into, the, high, arctic, at, the, time, of, a, warming, trend, c, 1000, ce, 28, their, major, population, centre, was, the, smith, sound, area, on, both, the, ellesmere, and, greenland, sides, due, to, its, proximity, to, polynyas, and, its, position, on, transportation, routes, 54, from, settlements, at, smith, sound, the, thule, sent, summer, hunting, parties, to, harvest, marine, mammals, in, nansen, strait, their, summer, camps, are, evidenced, by, tent, rings, as, far, north, as, archer, fiord, with, clusters, of, stone, dwellings, around, lady, franklin, bay, and, at, lake, hazen, which, suggest, semi, permanent, occupations, 28, the, thule, genetically, and, culturally, completely, replaced, the, dorset, people, some, time, after, 1300, ce, the, thule, displaced, the, small, tool, cultures, having, a, number, of, technological, advantages, which, notably, included, effective, weapons, kayaks, and, umiaks, for, hunting, marine, mammals, and, sled, dogs, for, surface, transport, and, pursuit, 51, the, thule, also, had, an, extensive, trade, network, evidenced, by, meteoritic, iron, from, greenland, which, was, exported, through, ellesmere, island, to, the, rest, of, the, archipelago, and, to, the, north, american, mainland, 52, 105, more, than, fifty, norse, artefacts, have, been, found, in, thule, archeological, sites, on, the, bache, peninsula, including, pieces, of, chain, mail, it, is, uncertain, if, ellesmere, island, was, directly, visited, by, norse, greenlanders, who, sailed, from, the, south, or, if, the, items, were, traded, through, a, network, of, middlemen, 54, it, is, also, possible, the, items, may, have, been, taken, from, a, shipwreck, 46, a, bronze, set, of, scales, discovered, in, western, ellesmere, island, has, been, interpreted, as, indicating, the, presence, of, a, norse, trader, in, the, region, 62, the, norse, artefacts, date, from, c, 1250, to, 1400, ce, between, 1400, and, 1600, ce, the, little, ice, age, developed, and, conditions, for, hunting, became, increasingly, difficult, forcing, the, thule, to, withdraw, from, ellesmere, and, the, other, northern, islands, of, the, archipelago, 29, the, thule, who, remained, in, northern, greenland, became, isolated, specialized, at, hunting, a, diminishing, number, of, game, animals, and, lost, the, ability, to, make, boats, thus, the, waters, around, ellesmere, were, not, navigated, again, until, the, arrival, of, large, european, vessels, after, 1800, 21, much, of, the, initial, phase, of, european, exploration, of, the, north, american, arctic, was, centred, on, a, search, for, the, northwest, passage, and, undertaken, by, britain, 334, the, 1616, expedition, of, william, baffin, were, the, first, europeans, to, record, sighting, the, then, unnamed, ellesmere, island, baffin, named, jones, and, smith, sounds, on, the, island, s, south, and, southeast, coasts, however, the, onset, of, the, little, ice, age, interrupted, the, progress, of, explorations, for, two, centuries, in, 1818, an, ice, jam, in, baffin, bay, broke, allowing, european, vessels, access, to, the, high, arctic, whalers, had, been, active, in, davis, strait, about, 1, 000, km, southeast, of, ellesmere, since, 1719, 29, 30, baffin, bay, was, then, navigable, in, the, summers, due, to, the, presence, of, an, ice, dam, in, smith, sound, which, prevented, arctic, drift, ice, from, flowing, south, the, other, channels, of, the, archipelago, remained, congested, with, ice, 37, that, year, john, ross, led, the, first, recorded, european, expedition, to, cape, york, 65, at, which, time, there, were, reportedly, only, 140, inughuit, 61, the, inughuit, of, north, greenland, the, kalaallit, of, west, greenland, and, inuit, of, the, archipelago, are, descendants, of, the, thule, culture, which, had, diverged, during, the, isolation, imposed, by, the, little, ice, age, knowledge, of, ellesmere, persisted, in, the, oral, histories, of, the, inuit, of, baffin, island, and, the, inughuit, of, northern, greenland, 55, who, each, called, it, umingmak, nuna, inuktitut, for, land, of, muskoxen, the, search, for, franklin, s, lost, expedition, also, searching, for, the, northwest, passage, and, to, establish, claims, to, the, far, north, involved, more, than, forty, expeditions, to, the, high, arctic, over, two, decades, and, represented, the, peak, period, of, euro, american, arctic, exploration, 334, 19, edward, augustus, inglefield, led, an, 1852, expedition, which, surveyed, the, coastlines, of, baffin, bay, and, smith, sound, being, stopped, by, ice, in, nares, strait, 339, he, named, ellesmere, island, for, the, president, of, the, royal, geographical, society, 1849, 1852, francis, egerton, 1st, earl, of, ellesmere, the, second, grinnell, expedition, 1853, 1855, made, slightly, further, progress, before, becoming, trapped, in, the, ice, over, two, winters, the, expedition, charted, both, sides, of, kane, basin, to, about, 80, n, from, where, elisha, kent, kane, claimed, to, have, sighted, the, conjectured, open, polar, sea, 339, 340, during, this, period, as, the, little, ice, age, abated, and, the, hunting, of, marine, mammals, became, more, feasible, again, aboriginal, peoples, began, to, return, to, ellesmere, island, the, most, well, known, of, these, migrations, in, both, inuit, and, european, accounts, is, the, journey, of, qitlaq, who, led, a, group, of, inuit, families, from, baffin, island, to, northwestern, greenland, via, ellesmere, island, in, the, 1850s, this, journey, reestablished, contact, between, inuit, who, had, been, separated, for, two, centuries, and, reintroduced, vital, technologies, to, the, inughuit, 99, 101, other, groups, followed, and, by, the, 1870s, inuit, were, living, on, ellesmere, island, and, had, regular, contact, with, those, on, the, neighbouring, islands, 109, contact, between, inuit, and, europeans, or, americans, was, often, indirect, as, the, inuit, happened, upon, shipwrecks, or, abandoned, base, camps, which, provided, wood, and, metal, resources, european, goods, were, also, obtained, through, inter, group, trade, long, term, contact, began, in, the, 1800s, through, whaling, stations, and, trading, posts, which, frequently, relocated, 12, euro, american, expeditions, employed, inughuit, inuit, and, west, greenlander, guides, hunters, and, labourers, gradually, blending, their, knowledge, with, european, technology, to, conduct, effective, exploration, 30, british, and, united, states, arctic, expeditions, had, been, interrupted, for, some, years, due, to, the, priorities, of, the, crimean, war, and, the, american, civil, war, respectively, 340, by, about, 1860, the, focus, of, arctic, exploration, had, shifted, to, the, north, pole, as, earlier, attempts, at, the, pole, via, svalbard, or, eastern, greenland, had, reached, impasses, numerous, expeditions, came, to, ellesmere, island, to, pursue, the, route, through, nares, straight, 334, the, united, states, expedition, led, by, adolphus, greely, in, 1881, crossed, the, island, from, east, to, west, 631, establishing, fort, conger, in, the, northern, part, of, the, island, the, greely, expedition, found, fossil, forests, on, ellesmere, island, in, the, late, 1880s, stenkul, fiord, was, first, explored, in, 1902, by, per, schei, a, member, of, otto, sverdrup, s, 2nd, norwegian, polar, expedition, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, was, documented, by, the, british, arctic, expedition, of, 1875, 76, in, which, lieutenant, pelham, aldrich, s, party, went, from, cape, sheridan, 82, 28, n,

the, ward, hunt, ice, shelf, in, 1906, robert, peary, led, an, expedition, in, northern, ellesmere, island, from, cape, sheridan, along, the, coast, to, the, western, side, of, nansen, sound, 93, w, during, peary, s, expedition, the, ice, shelf, was, continuous, it, has, since, been, estimated, to, have, covered, 8, 900, km, 2, 3, 400, sq, mi, the, ice, shelf, broke, apart, in, the, 20th, century, presumably, due, to, climate, change, in, 1880, the, british, arctic, territories, were, transferred, to, canada, canada, did, little, to, solidify, its, legal, possession, of, the, islands, until, prompted, by, foreign, action, in, 1902, 03, otto, sverdrup, claimed, three, islands, west, of, ellesmere, for, norway, the, alaska, boundary, dispute, was, settled, against, canada, s, interests, and, roald, amundsen, set, out, to, sail, the, northwest, passage, 101, 104, to, establish, an, official, government, presence, in, the, far, north, the, north, west, mounted, police, nwmp, were, sent, on, sovereignty, patrols, a, nwmp, detachment, sailed, to, the, arctic, whaling, stations, in, 1903, where, they, forbade, whalers, from, killing, muskox, or, trading, skins, in, order, to, prevent, overhunting, and, protect, the, inuit, s, ability, to, sustain, themselves, in, 1904, a, nwmp, detachment, sailed, to, cape, herschel, at, the, east, end, of, sverdrup, pass, where, they, could, intercept, hunters, accessing, the, interior, of, ellesmere, 101, 104, while, the, fur, trade, was, brought, under, control, american, exploration, parties, to, the, far, north, had, acted, with, autonomy, and, intensively, hunted, terrestrial, mammals, to, sustain, their, expeditions, peary, s, parties, had, heavily, hunted, muskoxen, on, ellesmere, and, had, nearly, brought, the, extinction, of, caribou, in, northern, greenland, the, crocker, land, expedition, 1913, 1916, also, extensively, hunted, muskoxen, in, response, to, these, and, other, trespasses, the, government, amended, the, northwest, game, act, to, prohibit, the, killing, of, muskoxen, except, for, native, inhabitants, who, otherwise, faced, starvation, 102, in, 1920, the, government, learned, that, inughuit, from, greenland, had, been, annually, visiting, ellesmere, island, for, polar, bear, and, muskox, hunting, in, violation, of, canadian, law, selling, the, skins, at, knud, rasmussen, s, trading, post, at, qaanaaq, formerly, known, as, thule, the, danish, government, stated, that, north, greenland, was, a, no, man, s, land, outside, their, administration, and, rasmussen, as, the, de, facto, sole, authority, refused, to, stop, the, trade, which, the, inughuit, needed, to, support, themselves, in, response, royal, canadian, mounted, police, rcmp, detachments, were, established, on, ellesmere, island, at, craig, harbour, in, 1922, and, at, bache, post, in, 1926, positioned, to, guard, the, coastal, and, overland, routes, to, the, hunting, grounds, on, the, western, side, of, ellesmere, 102, 104, 315, 316, in, addition, to, intercepting, illegal, hunting, and, fur, trading, the, rcmp, conducted, patrols, and, encouraged, the, inuit, to, maintain, their, traditional, lifestyle, 25, 26, the, posts, were, closed, in, the, mid, 1930s, after, the, sovereignty, issues, had, been, settled, 105, ellesmere, island, is, the, northernmost, island, of, the, arctic, archipelago, in, canada, s, far, north, and, one, of, the, world, s, northernmost, land, masses, it, is, exceeded, in, this, regard, only, by, neighbouring, greenland, which, extends, about, 60, km,
