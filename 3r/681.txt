greater, khorasan, middle, persian, romanized, or, s, n, persian, is, a, historical, eastern, region, in, the, iranian, plateau, in, west, and, central, asia, that, encompasses, western, and, northern, afghanistan, northeastern, iran, the, eastern, halves, of, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, western, tajikistan, and, portions, of, kyrgyzstan, and, kazakhstan, the, extent, of, the, region, referred, to, as, khorasan, varied, over, time, in, its, stricter, historical, sense, it, comprised, the, present, territories, of, northeastern, iran, parts, of, afghanistan, and, southern, parts, of, central, asia, extending, as, far, as, the, amu, darya, oxus, river, however, the, name, has, often, been, used, in, a, loose, sense, to, include, a, wider, region, that, included, most, of, transoxiana, encompassing, bukhara, and, samarqand, in, present, day, uzbekistan, extended, westward, to, the, caspian, coast, and, to, the, dasht, e, kavir, southward, to, sistan, and, eastward, to, the, pamir, mountains, greater, khorasan, is, today, sometimes, used, to, distinguish, the, larger, historical, region, from, the, former, khorasan, province, of, iran, 1906, 2004, which, roughly, encompassed, the, western, portion, of, the, historical, greater, khorasan, the, name, khor, s, n, is, persian, from, middle, persian, xwar, s, n, sp, xwl, s, n, meaning, where, the, sun, arrives, from, or, the, eastern, province, the, name, was, first, given, to, the, eastern, province, of, persia, ancient, iran, during, the, sasanian, empire, and, was, used, from, the, late, middle, ages, in, distinction, to, neighbouring, transoxiana, the, sassanian, name, xwar, s, n, has, in, turn, been, argued, to, be, a, calque, of, the, bactrian, name, of, the, region, miirosan, bactrian, spelling, earlier, which, had, the, same, meaning, sunrise, east, corresponding, to, a, hypothetical, proto, iranian, form, mi, r, s, na, see, mithra, bactrian, for, the, relevant, solar, deity, the, province, was, often, subdivided, into, four, quarters, such, that, nishapur, present, day, iran, marv, present, day, turkmenistan, herat, and, balkh, present, day, afghanistan, were, the, centers, respectively, of, the, westernmost, northernmost, central, and, easternmost, quarters, khorasan, was, first, established, as, an, administrative, division, in, the, 6th, century, approximately, after, 520, by, the, sasanians, during, the, reign, of, kavad, i, r, 488, 496, 498, 9, 531, or, khosrow, i, r, 531, 579, and, comprised, the, eastern, and, northeastern, parts, of, the, empire, the, use, of, bactrian, miirosan, the, east, as, an, administrative, designation, under, alkhan, rulers, in, the, same, region, is, possibly, the, forerunner, of, the, sasanian, administrative, division, of, khurasan, occurring, after, their, takeover, of, hephthalite, territories, south, of, the, oxus, the, transformation, of, the, term, and, its, identification, with, a, larger, region, is, thus, a, development, of, the, late, sasanian, and, early, islamic, periods, early, islamic, usage, often, regarded, everywhere, east, of, jibal, or, what, was, subsequently, termed, iraq, ajami, persian, iraq, as, being, included, in, a, vast, and, loosely, defined, region, of, khorasan, which, might, even, extend, to, the, indus, valley, and, the, pamir, mountains, the, boundary, between, these, two, was, the, region, surrounding, the, cities, of, gurgan, and, qumis, in, particular, the, ghaznavids, seljuqs, and, timurids, divided, their, empires, into, iraqi, and, khorasani, regions, khorasan, is, believed, to, have, been, bounded, in, the, southwest, by, desert, and, the, town, of, tabas, known, as, the, gate, of, khorasan, 562, from, which, it, extended, eastward, to, the, mountains, of, central, afghanistan, sources, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, refer, to, areas, in, the, south, of, the, hindu, kush, as, the, khorasan, marches, forming, a, frontier, region, between, khorasan, and, hindustan, first, established, in, the, 6th, century, as, one, of, four, administrative, military, divisions, by, the, sasanian, empire, the, scope, of, the, region, has, varied, considerably, during, its, nearly, 1, 500, year, history, initially, the, khorasan, division, of, the, sasanian, empire, covered, the, northeastern, military, gains, of, the, empire, at, its, height, including, cities, such, as, nishapur, herat, merv, faryab, taloqan, balkh, bukhara, badghis, abiward, gharjistan, tus, and, sarakhs, with, the, rise, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, designation, was, inherited, and, likewise, stretched, as, far, as, their, military, gains, in, the, east, starting, off, with, the, military, installations, at, nishapur, and, merv, slowly, expanding, eastwards, into, tokharistan, and, sogdia, under, the, caliphs, khorasan, was, the, name, of, one, of, the, three, political, zones, under, their, dominion, the, other, two, being, eraq, e, arab, arabic, iraq, and, eraq, e, ajam, non, arabic, iraq, or, persian, iraq, under, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, caliphates, khorasan, was, divided, into, four, major, sections, or, quarters, rub, each, section, based, on, a, single, major, city, nishapur, merv, herat, and, balkh, by, the, 10th, century, ibn, khordadbeh, and, the, hudud, al, alam, mentions, what, roughly, encompasses, the, previous, regions, of, abarshahr, tokharistan, and, sogdia, as, khwarasan, proper, they, further, report, the, southern, part, of, the, hindu, kush, i, e, the, regions, of, sistan, rukhkhudh, zabulistan, and, kabul, etc, to, make, up, the, khorasan, marches, a, frontier, region, between, khorasan, and, hindustan, by, the, late, middle, ages, the, term, lost, its, administrative, significance, in, the, west, only, being, loosely, applied, among, the, turko, persian, dynasties, of, modern, iran, to, all, its, territories, that, lay, east, and, north, east, of, the, dasht, e, kavir, desert, it, was, therefore, subjected, to, constant, change, as, the, size, of, their, empires, changed, in, the, east, khwarasan, likewise, became, a, term, associated, with, the, great, urban, centers, of, central, asia, it, is, mentioned, in, the, memoirs, of, babur, from, the, 1580s, that, the, people, of, hindust, n, call, every, country, beyond, their, own, khoras, n, in, the, same, manner, as, the, arabs, term, all, except, arabia, ajem, on, the, road, between, hindust, n, and, khoras, n, there, are, two, great, marts, the, one, k, bul, the, other, kandah, r, caravans, from, fergh, na, t, rkest, n, samarkand, balkh, bokh, ra, hiss, r, and, badakhsh, n, all, resort, to, k, bul, while, those, from, khoras, n, repair, to, kandah, r, this, country, lies, between, hindust, n, and, khoras, n, in, modern, times, the, term, has, been, source, of, great, nostalgia, and, nationalism, especially, amongst, the, tajiks, of, central, asia, many, tajiks, regard, khorasan, as, an, integral, part, of, their, national, identity, which, has, preserved, an, interest, in, the, term, including, its, meaning, and, cultural, significance, both, in, common, discussion, and, academia, despite, its, falling, out, of, political, use, in, the, region, according, to, afghan, historian, ghulam, mohammad, ghobar, 1897, 1978, afghanistan, s, current, persian, speaking, territories, formed, the, major, portion, of, khoras, n, as, two, of, the, four, main, capitals, of, khoras, n, herat, and, balkh, are, now, located, in, afghanistan, ghobar, uses, the, terms, proper, khorasan, and, improper, khorasan, in, his, book, to, distinguish, between, the, usage, of, khoras, n, in, its, strict, sense, and, its, usage, in, a, loose, sense, according, to, him, proper, khorasan, contained, regions, lying, between, balkh, in, the, east, merv, in, the, north, sistan, in, the, south, nishapur, in, the, west, and, herat, known, as, the, pearl, of, khorasan, in, the, center, improper, khorasan, s, boundaries, extended, to, as, far, as, hazarajat, and, kabul, in, the, east, baluchistan, in, the, south, transoxiana, and, khwarezm, in, the, north, and, damghan, and, gorgan, in, the, west, during, the, sasanian, era, likely, in, the, reign, of, khusrow, i, persia, was, divided, into, four, regions, known, as, kust, middle, persian, khw, rvar, n, in, the, west, ap, xtar, in, the, north, n, mr, z, in, the, south, and, khorasan, in, the, east, since, the, sasanian, territories, were, more, or, less, remained, stable, up, to, islamic, conquests, it, can, be, concluded, that, sasanian, khorasan, was, bordered, to, the, south, by, sistan, and, kerman, to, the, west, by, the, central, deserts, of, modern, iran, and, to, the, east, by, china, and, india, in, the, sasanian, era, khorasan, was, further, divided, into, four, smaller, regions, and, each, region, was, ruled, by, a, marzban, these, four, regions, were, nishapur, marv, herat, and, balkh, khorasan, in, the, east, saw, some, conflict, with, the, hephthalites, who, became, the, new, rulers, in, the, area, but, the, borders, remained, stable, being, the, eastern, parts, of, the, sassanids, and, further, away, from, arabia, khorasan, region, was, conquered, after, the, remaining, persia, the, last, sassanid, king, of, persia, yazdgerd, iii, moved, the, throne, to, khorasan, following, the, arab, invasion, in, the, western, parts, of, the, empire, after, the, assassination, of, the, king, khorasan, was, conquered, by, arab, muslims, in, 647, ad, like, other, provinces, of, persia, it, became, a, province, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, first, movement, against, the, arab, conquest, was, led, by, abu, muslim, khorasani, between, 747, and, 750, originally, from, isfahan, scholars, believe, abu, muslim, was, probably, persian, it, s, possible, he, may, have, been, born, a, slave, according, to, the, ancient, persian, historian, al, shahrastani, he, was, a, kaysanite, this, revolutionary, shi, a, movement, rejected, the, three, caliphs, that, had, preceded, ali, abu, muslim, helped, the, abbasids, come, to, power, but, was, later, killed, by, al, mansur, an, abbasid, caliph, the, first, kingdom, independent, from, arab, rule, was, established, in, khorasan, by, tahir, phoshanji, in, 821, but, it, seems, that, it, was, more, a, matter, of, political, and, territorial, gain, tahir, had, helped, the, caliph, subdue, other, nationalistic, movements, in, other, parts, of, persia, such, as, maziar, s, movement, in, tabaristan, other, major, independent, dynasties, who, ruled, over, khorasan, were, the, saffarids, from, zaranj, 861, 1003, samanids, from, bukhara, 875, 999, ghaznavids, from, ghazni, 963, 1167, seljuqs, 1037, 1194, khwarezmids, 1077, 1231, ghurids, 1149, 1212, and, timurids, 1370, 1506, in, 1221, genghis, khan, s, son, tolui, oversaw, the, mongol, subjugation, of, khorasan, carrying, out, the, task, with, a, thoroughness, from, which, that, region, has, never, recovered, throughout, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, century, the, majority, of, islamic, archaeological, efforts, were, focused, on, the, medieval, era, predominantly, in, areas, near, what, is, today, central, asia, under, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, the, rashidun, caliphate, seized, nearly, the, entire, persia, from, the, sasanian, empire, however, the, areas, of, khorasan, weren, t, conquered, until, c, 651, during, the, caliphate, of, uthman, r, 644, 656, the, rashidun, commanders, ahnaf, ibn, qays, and, abd, allah, ibn, amir, were, assigned, to, lead, the, invasion, of, khorasan, in, late, 651, the, rashidun, army, defeated, the, combined, forces, of, the, sasanian, and, the, first, turkic, khaganate, in, the, battle, of, the, oxus, river, the, next, year, ibn, amir, concluded, a, peace, treaty, with, kanadbak, an, iranian, nobleman, and, the, kanarang, of, tus, the, sasanian, rebel, burzin, shah, of, the, karen, family, revolted, against, ibn, amir, though, the, latter, crushed, the, rebels, in, the, battle, of, nishapur, after, the, invasion, of, persia, under, rashidun, was, completed, in, five, years, and, almost, all, of, the, persian, territories, came, under, arab, control, it, also, inevitable, created, new, problems, for, the, caliphate, pockets, of, tribal, resistance, continued, for, centuries, in, the, afghan, territories, during, the, 7th, century, arab, armies, made, their, way, into, the, region, of, afghanistan, from, khorasan, a, second, problem, was, as, a, corollary, to, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, the, muslims, became, neighbors, of, the, city, states, of, transoxiana, although, transoxiana, was, included, in, the, loosely, defined, turkestan, region, only, the, ruling, elite, of, transoxiana, was, partially, of, turkic, origins, whereas, the, local, population, was, mostly, a, diverse, mix, of, local, iranian, populations, as, the, arabs, reached, transoxiana, following, the, conquest, of, the, sassanid, persian, empire, local, iranian, turkic, and, arab, armies, clashed, over, the, control, of, transoxiana, s, silk, road, cities, in, particular, the, turgesh, under, the, leadership, of, suluk, and, khazars, under, barjik, clashed, with, their, arab, neighbours, in, order, to, control, this, economically, important, region, two, notable, umayyad, generals, qutayba, ibn, muslim, and, nasr, ibn, sayyar, were, instrumental, in, the, eventual, conquest, in, july, 738, at, the, age, of, 74, nasr, was, appointed, as, governor, of, khorasan, despite, his, age, he, was, widely, respected, both, for, his, military, record, his, knowledge, of, the, affairs, of, khorasan, and, his, abilities, as, a, statesman, julius, wellhausen, wrote, of, him, that, his, age, did, not, affect, the, freshness, of, his, mind, as, is, testified, not, only, by, his, deeds, but, also, by, the, verses, in, which, he, gave, expression, to, his, feelings, till, the, very, end, of, his, life, however, in, the, climate, of, the, times, his, nomination, owed, more, to, his, appropriate, tribal, affiliation, than, his, personal, qualities, in, 724, immediately, after, the, rise, of, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, r, 724, 743, to, the, throne, asad, s, brother, khalid, al, qasri, was, appointed, to, the, important, post, of, governor, of, iraq, with, responsibility, over, the, entire, islamic, east, which, he, held, until, 738, khalid, in, turn, named, asad, as, governor, of, khorasan, the, two, brothers, thus, became, according, to, patricia, crone, among, the, most, prominent, men, of, the, marwanid, period, asad, s, arrival, in, khorasan, found, the, province, in, peril, his, predecessor, muslim, ibn, sa, id, al, kilabi, had, just, attempted, a, campaign, against, ferghana, and, suffered, a, major, defeat, the, so, called, day, of, thirst, at, the, hands, of, the, turgesh, turks, and, the, soghdian, principalities, of, transoxiana, that, had, risen, up, against, muslim, rule, from, the, early, days, of, the, muslim, conquests, arab, armies, were, divided, into, regiments, drawn, from, individual, tribes, or, tribal, confederations, butun, or, asha, ir, despite, the, fact, that, many, of, these, groupings, were, recent, creations, created, for, reasons, of, military, efficiency, rather, than, any, common, ancestry, they, soon, developed, a, strong, and, distinct, identity, by, the, beginning, of, the, umayyad, period, this, system, progressed, to, the, formation, of, ever, larger, super, groupings, culminating, in, the, two, super, groups, the, northern, arab, mudaris, or, qaysis, and, the, south, arabs, or, yemenis, yaman, dominated, by, the, azd, and, rabi, ah, tribes, by, the, 8th, century, this, division, had, become, firmly, established, across, the, caliphate, and, was, a, source, of, constant, internal, instability, as, the, two, groups, formed, in, essence, two, rival, political, parties, jockeying, for, power, and, separated, by, a, fierce, hatred, for, each, other, during, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, s, reign, the, umayyad, government, appointed, mudaris, as, governors, in, khorasan, except, for, asad, ibn, abdallah, al, qasri, s, tenure, in, 735, 738, nasr, s, appointment, came, four, months, after, asad, s, death, in, the, interim, the, sources, report, variously, that, the, province, was, run, either, by, the, syrian, general, ja, far, ibn, hanzala, al, bahrani, or, by, asad, s, lieutenant, juday, al, kirmani, at, any, rate, the, sources, agree, that, al, kirmani, stood, at, the, time, as, the, most, prominent, man, in, khorasan, and, should, have, been, the, clear, choice, for, governor, his, yemeni, roots, he, was, the, leader, of, the, azd, in, khorasan, however, made, him, unpalatable, to, the, caliph, khorasan, became, the, headquarters, of, the, abbasid, revolution, against, the, umayyads, it, was, led, by, abu, muslim, who, himself, belonged, to, khorasan, this, province, was, part, of, the, iranian, world, that, had, been, heavily, colonised, by, arab, tribes, following, the, muslim, conquest, with, the, intent, of, replacing, umayyad, dynasty, which, is, proved, to, be, successful, under, the, sign, of, the, black, standard, between, the, early, 16th, and, early, 18th, centuries, parts, of, khorasan, were, contested, between, the, safavids, and, the, uzbeks, a, part, of, the, khorasan, region, was, conquered, in, 1722, by, the, ghilji, pashtuns, from, kandahar, and, became, part, of, the, hotaki, dynasty, from, 1722, to, 1729, nader, shah, recaptured, khorasan, in, 1729, and, chose, mashhad, as, the, capital, of, persia, following, his, assassination, in, 1747, the, eastern, parts, of, khorasan, including, herat, were, annexed, with, the, durrani, empire, mashhad, area, was, under, control, of, nader, shah, s, grandson, shahrukh, afshar, until, it, was, captured, by, the, qajar, dynasty, in, 1796, in, 1856, the, iranians, under, the, qajar, dynasty, briefly, recaptured, herat, by, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1857, signed, between, iran, and, the, british, empire, to, end, the, anglo, persian, war, the, iranian, troops, withdrew, from, herat, later, in, 1881, iran, relinquished, its, claims, to, a, part, of, the, northern, areas, of, khorasan, to, the, russian, empire, principally, comprising, merv, by, the, treaty, of, akhal, also, known, as, the, treaty, of, akhal, khorasan, khorasan, has, had, a, great, cultural, importance, among, other, regions, in, greater, iran, the, literary, new, persian, language, developed, in, khorasan, and, transoxiana, and, gradually, supplanted, the, parthian, language, the, new, persian, literature, arose, and, flourished, in, khorasan, and, transoxiana, where, the, early, iranian, dynasties, such, as, tahirids, samanids, saffirids, and, ghaznavids, a, turco, persian, dynasty, were, based, until, the, devastating, mongol, invasion, of, the, 13th, century, khorasan, remained, the, cultural, capital, of, persia, it, has, produced, scientists, such, as, avicenna, al, farabi, al, biruni, omar, khayyam, al, khwarizmi, abu, ma, shar, al, balkhi, known, as, albumasar, or, albuxar, in, the, west, alfraganus, abu, wafa, nasir, al,

physics, geography, and, geology, there, have, been, many, archaeological, sites, throughout, khorasan, however, many, of, these, expeditions, were, illegal, or, committed, in, the, sole, pursuit, of, profit, leaving, many, sites, without, documentation, or, record, 36, n, 62, e, 36, n, 62, e, 36, 62
