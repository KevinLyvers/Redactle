the, skagerrak, danish, norwegian, swedish, is, a, strait, running, between, the, jutland, peninsula, of, denmark, the, east, coast, of, norway, and, the, west, coast, of, sweden, connecting, the, north, sea, and, the, kattegat, sea, the, skagerrak, contains, some, of, the, busiest, shipping, routes, in, the, world, with, vessels, from, every, corner, of, the, globe, it, also, supports, an, intensive, fishing, industry, the, ecosystem, is, strained, and, negatively, affected, by, direct, human, activities, oslo, and, gothenburg, are, the, only, large, cities, in, the, skagerrak, region, the, strait, is, likely, named, after, skagen, a, town, near, the, northern, cape, of, denmark, with, rak, meaning, straight, waterway, the, skagerrak, is, 240, km, long, and, 80, 140, km, wide, deepening, towards, the, norwegian, coast, it, has, an, average, salinity, comparable, to, other, coastal, waters, housing, a, variety, of, habitats, historically, the, skagerrak, was, the, only, access, to, the, baltic, sea, until, the, construction, of, the, eider, canal, in, 1784, during, both, world, wars, the, strait, held, strategic, importance, for, germany, presently, it, remains, one, of, the, busiest, straits, worldwide, the, skagerrak, is, a, habitat, for, approximately, 2, 000, marine, species, including, a, unique, variety, of, atlantic, cod, it, also, contains, sandy, and, stony, reefs, and, cold, water, coral, reefs, environmental, institutions, have, expressed, concern, about, increasing, pressure, on, the, ecosystem, due, to, human, activities, and, climate, change, protections, are, in, place, with, several, marine, protected, areas, in, skagerrak, including, ytre, hvaler, national, park, in, norway, and, kosterhavet, national, park, in, sweden, the, meaning, of, skagerrak, is, most, likely, the, skagen, channel, strait, skagen, is, a, town, near, the, northern, cape, of, denmark, the, skaw, in, dutch, rak, means, straight, waterway, as, seen, in, dutch, hydronyms, such, as, damrak, gouderak, langerak, tuikwerderrak, and, volkerak, cognate, with, reach, the, ultimate, source, of, this, syllable, is, the, proto, indo, european, root, reg, straight, rak, means, straight, as, in, straight, ahead, in, modern, norwegian, and, swedish, r, k, in, both, modern, norwegian, and, swedish, refers, to, a, channel, or, opening, of, water, in, an, otherwise, ice, covered, body, of, water, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, a, connection, with, the, modern, danish, word, rak, meaning, rabble, or, riff, raff, it, is, therefore, likely, that, the, skagerrak, was, named, by, dutch, seafarers, as, was, the, adjacent, kattegat, the, skagerrak, is, 240, km, 150, mi, long, and, between, 80, and, 140, km, 50, and, 87, mi, wide, it, deepens, toward, the, norwegian, coast, reaching, over, 700, m, at, the, norwegian, trench, some, ports, along, the, skagerrak, are, oslo, larvik, and, kristiansand, in, norway, skagen, hirtshals, and, hanstholm, in, denmark, and, uddevalla, lysekil, and, str, mstad, in, sweden, the, skagerrak, has, an, average, salinity, of, 80, practical, salinity, units, which, is, very, low, close, to, that, of, brackish, water, but, comparable, to, most, other, coastal, waters, the, area, available, to, biomass, is, about, 3, 600, km, 2, 1, 400, sq, mi, and, includes, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, from, shallow, sandy, and, stony, reefs, in, sweden, and, denmark, to, the, depths, of, the, norwegian, trench, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, skagerrak, as, follows, on, the, west, a, line, joining, hanstholm, 57, 07, n, 8, 36, e, 57, 117, n, 8, 600, e, 57, 117, 8, 600, and, the, naze, lindesnes, 58, n, 7, e, 58, n, 7, e, 58, 7, on, the, southeast, the, northern, limit, of, the, kattegat, older, names, for, the, combined, skagerrak, and, kattegat, were, the, norwegian, sea, or, jutland, sea, the, latter, appears, in, the, kn, tlinga, saga, until, the, construction, of, the, eider, canal, in, 1784, a, predecessor, to, the, kiel, canal, skagerrak, was, the, only, way, in, and, out, of, the, baltic, sea, for, this, reason, the, strait, has, had, busy, international, traffic, for, centuries, after, the, industrial, revolution, the, traffic, increased, and, today, skagerrak, is, among, the, busiest, straits, in, the, world, in, 1862, a, short, cut, the, thybor, n, channel, at, the, limfjord, was, constructed, in, denmark, through, skagerrak, from, the, north, sea, by, going, directly, to, the, kattegat, the, limfjord, supports, only, minor, transports, though, in, both, world, wars, the, skagerrak, was, strategically, very, important, for, germany, the, biggest, sea, battle, of, the, first, world, war, the, battle, of, jutland, also, known, as, the, battle, of, the, skagerrak, took, place, here, may, 31, to, june, 1, 1916, in, the, second, world, war, the, importance, of, controlling, this, waterway, the, only, sea, access, to, the, baltic, was, the, motive, for, the, german, invasions, of, denmark, and, norway, as, well, as, the, construction, of, the, northern, parts, of, the, atlantic, wall, both, of, these, naval, engagements, have, contributed, to, the, large, number, of, shipwrecks, in, the, skagerrak, skagerrak, is, a, busy, shipping, lane, with, c, 7, 500, individual, vessels, excluding, fishing, vessels, from, all, over, the, world, visiting, in, 2013, alone, cargo, ships, are, by, far, the, most, common, vessel, in, skagerrak, at, c, 4, 000, individual, ships, in, 2013, followed, by, tankers, which, are, nearly, half, as, frequent, when, viewed, in, combination, with, the, baltic, sea, area, ships, from, 122, different, nationalities, visited, in, 2013, with, most, of, these, carrying, cargo, or, passengers, within, europe, regardless, of, their, flag, state, nearly, all, commercial, vessels, in, skagerrak, are, tracked, by, the, automatic, identification, system, ais, skagerrak, is, popular, for, recreational, activities, in, all, three, countries, there, are, many, summer, house, residences, and, several, marinas, along, the, coasts, the, skagerrak, is, habitat, for, approximately, 2, 000, marine, species, many, of, them, adapted, to, its, waters, for, example, a, variety, of, atlantic, cod, called, the, skagerrak, cod, spawns, off, the, norwegian, coast, the, eggs, are, buoyant, and, the, hatchlings, feed, on, zooplankton, juveniles, sink, to, the, bottom, where, they, have, a, shorter, maturity, cycle, 2, years, they, do, not, migrate, but, remain, local, to, norwegian, fjords, the, variety, of, habitats, and, the, large, volume, of, plankton, on, the, surface, support, prolific, marine, life, energy, moves, from, the, top, to, the, bottom, according, to, vinogradov, s, ladder, of, migrations, that, is, some, species, are, benthic, and, others, pelagic, but, there, are, graded, marine, layers, within, which, species, move, vertically, for, short, distances, in, addition, some, species, are, benthopelagic, moving, between, surface, and, bottom, the, benthic, species, include, coryphaenoides, rupestris, argentina, silus, etmopterus, spinax, chimaera, monstrosa, and, glyptocephalus, cynoglossus, on, the, top, are, clupea, harengus, scomber, scombrus, sprattus, sprattus, some, species, that, move, between, are, pandalus, borealis, sabinea, sarsi, etmopterus, spinax, apart, from, sandy, and, stony, reefs, extensive, cold, water, coral, reefs, mostly, of, lophelia, are, growing, in, skagerrak, the, s, cken, reef, in, the, swedish, marine, protection, of, koster, fjord, is, an, ancient, cold, water, coral, reef, and, the, only, known, coral, reef, in, the, country, the, tisler, reef, in, the, norwegian, marine, protection, of, ytre, hvaler, national, park, is, the, largest, known, coral, reef, in, europe, lophelia, reefs, are, also, present, in, the, norwegian, trench, and, they, are, known, from, the, shallow, waters, of, many, norwegian, fjords, skagerrak, also, holds, a, number, of, rare, bubble, reefs, biological, reefs, formed, around, cold, seeps, of, geological, carbohydrate, outgassings, usually, methane, these, rare, habitats, are, mostly, known, from, the, danish, waters, of, skagerrak, west, of, hirtshals, but, more, might, be, discovered, in, future, surveys, bubbly, reefs, are, very, rare, in, europe, and, supports, a, very, varied, ecosystem, with, the, centuries, long, heavy, international, seatraffic, of, skagerrak, the, seabed, also, holds, an, abundance, of, shipwrecks, wrecks, on, shallow, waters, provides, a, firm, anchoring, for, several, corals, and, polyps, and, explored, wrecks, have, been, revealed, to, support, dead, man, s, fingers, corals, brittle, stars, and, large, wolffish, a, 2020, seafloor, mapping, project, around, jammerbugten, in, skaggerak, ran, by, danish, explorer, klaus, thymann, found, evidence, of, much, greater, biodiversity, in, a, range, seafloor, habitats, previously, thought, to, be, sandy, with, a, low, density, of, wildlife, dead, man, s, fingers, corals, were, again, among, the, species, documented, for, the, first, time, in, these, coastal, habitats, scientists, and, environmental, institutions, have, expressed, concern, about, the, increasing, pressure, on, the, ecosystem, in, skagerrak, the, pressure, has, already, had, negative, impacts, and, is, caused, by, cumulative, environmental, effects, of, which, direct, human, activities, are, only, one, piece, of, the, puzzle, climate, change, and, ocean, acidification, are, expected, to, have, increasing, impacts, on, the, skagerrak, ecosystem, in, the, future, skagerrak, and, the, north, sea, receives, considerable, inputs, of, hazardous, material, and, radioactive, substances, most, is, ascribed, to, long, range, transport, from, other, countries, but, not, all, marine, litter, is, also, a, growing, problem, until, recently, waste, water, and, sewage, pouring, into, skagerrak, from, settlements, and, industries, was, not, treated, at, all, in, combination, with, wash, out, of, excessive, nutrients, from, conventional, farming, this, has, often, led, to, large, algae, blooms, there, are, several, marine, protections, in, skagerrak, including, skaagerak, is, the, setting, of, the, popular, television, show, badehotellet, from, denmark
