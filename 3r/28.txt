23, 26, 12, 5, n, 0, 0, 0, w, 23, 436806, n, 0, 00000, e, 23, 436806, 0, 00000, prime, meridian, the, tropic, of, cancer, also, known, as, the, northern, tropic, is, the, earth, s, northernmost, circle, of, latitude, where, the, sun, can, be, seen, directly, overhead, this, occurs, on, the, june, solstice, when, the, northern, hemisphere, is, tilted, toward, the, sun, to, its, maximum, extent, it, also, reaches, 90, degrees, below, the, horizon, at, solar, midnight, on, the, december, solstice, using, a, continuously, updated, formula, the, circle, is, currently, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, north, of, the, equator, its, southern, hemisphere, counterpart, marking, the, most, southerly, position, at, which, the, sun, can, be, seen, directly, overhead, is, the, tropic, of, capricorn, these, tropics, are, two, of, the, five, major, circles, of, latitude, that, mark, maps, of, earth, the, others, being, the, arctic, and, antarctic, circles, and, the, equator, the, positions, of, these, two, circles, of, latitude, relative, to, the, equator, are, dictated, by, the, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, relative, to, the, plane, of, its, orbit, and, since, the, tilt, changes, the, location, of, these, two, circles, also, changes, in, geopolitics, it, is, known, for, being, the, southern, limitation, on, the, mutual, defence, obligation, of, nato, as, member, states, of, nato, are, not, obligated, to, come, to, the, defence, of, territory, south, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, when, this, line, of, latitude, was, named, in, the, last, centuries, bce, the, sun, was, in, the, constellation, cancer, latin, crab, at, the, june, solstice, 90, ecliptic, longitude, due, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, this, is, no, longer, the, case, today, the, sun, is, in, constellation, taurus, at, the, june, solstice, the, word, tropic, itself, comes, from, the, greek, trope, meaning, turn, change, of, direction, or, circumstance, inclination, referring, to, the, fact, that, the, sun, appears, to, turn, back, at, the, solstices, the, tropic, of, cancer, s, position, is, not, fixed, but, constantly, changes, because, of, a, slight, wobble, in, the, earth, s, longitudinal, alignment, relative, to, the, ecliptic, the, plane, in, which, the, earth, orbits, around, the, sun, earth, s, axial, tilt, varies, over, a, 41, 000, year, period, from, about, 22, 1, to, 24, 5, degrees, and, as, of, 2000, is, about, 23, 4, degrees, which, will, continue, to, remain, valid, for, about, a, millennium, this, wobble, means, that, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, currently, drifting, southward, at, a, rate, of, almost, half, an, arcsecond, 0, 468, of, latitude, or, 15, m, 49, ft, per, year, the, circle, s, position, was, at, exactly, 23, 27, n, in, 1917, and, will, be, at, 23, 26, n, in, 2045, the, distance, between, the, antarctic, circle, and, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, essentially, constant, as, they, move, in, tandem, this, is, based, on, an, assumption, of, a, constant, equator, but, the, precise, location, of, the, equator, is, not, truly, fixed, see, equator, axial, tilt, and, circles, of, latitude, for, additional, details, download, coordinates, as, north, of, the, tropic, are, the, subtropics, and, the, north, temperate, zone, the, equivalent, line, of, latitude, south, of, the, equator, is, called, the, tropic, of, capricorn, and, the, region, between, the, two, centered, on, the, equator, is, the, tropics, in, the, year, 2000, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, population, lived, north, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, on, the, tropic, of, cancer, there, are, approximately, 13, hours, 35, minutes, of, daylight, during, the, summer, solstice, during, the, winter, solstice, there, are, 10, hours, 41, minutes, of, daylight, using, 23, 26, n, for, the, tropic, of, cancer, the, tropic, passes, through, the, following, 17, countries, including, two, disputed, territories, and, 8, water, bodies, starting, at, the, prime, meridian, and, heading, eastward, the, climate, at, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, generally, hot, and, dry, except, for, cooler, highland, regions, in, china, marine, environments, such, as, hawaii, and, easterly, coastal, areas, where, orographic, rainfall, can, be, very, heavy, in, some, places, reaching, 4, metres, 160, in, annually, most, regions, on, the, tropic, of, cancer, experience, two, distinct, seasons, an, extremely, hot, summer, with, temperatures, often, reaching, 45, c, 113, f, and, a, warm, winter, with, maxima, around, 22, c, 72, f, much, land, on, or, near, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, part, of, the, sahara, desert, while, to, the, east, the, climate, is, torrid, monsoonal, with, a, short, wet, season, from, june, to, september, and, very, little, rainfall, for, the, rest, of, the, year, the, highest, mountain, on, or, adjacent, to, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, yu, shan, in, taiwan, it, had, glaciers, descending, as, low, as, 2, 800, metres, 9, 190, ft, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, at, present, glaciers, still, exist, around, the, tropic, the, nearest, currently, surviving, are, the, minyong, and, baishui, in, the, himalayas, to, the, north, and, on, iztacc, huatl, in, mexico, to, the, south, according, to, the, rules, of, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, for, a, flight, to, compete, for, a, round, the, world, speed, record, it, must, cover, a, distance, no, less, than, the, length, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, cross, all, meridians, and, end, on, the, same, airfield, where, it, started, length, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, 36, 788, km, 22, 859, mi, for, an, ordinary, circumnavigation, the, rules, are, somewhat, relaxed, and, the, distance, is, set, to, a, rounded, value, of, at, least, 36, 770,
