slowly, adopting, christianity, and, began, to, build, a, new, state, the, hungarian, kingdom, in, the, years, 1001, 1002, and, 1018, 1029, slovakia, was, part, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, having, been, conquered, by, boleslaus, i, the, brave, after, the, territory, of, slovakia, was, returned, to, hungary, a, semi, autonomous, polity, continued, to, exist, or, was, created, in, 1048, by, king, andrew, i, called, duchy, of, nitra, comprising, roughly, the, territory, of, principality, of, nitra, and, bihar, principality, they, formed, what, was, called, a, tercia, pars, regni, third, of, a,

slovakia, was, an, integral, part, of, the, hungarian, state, the, ethnic, composition, of, slovakia, became, more, diverse, with, the, arrival, of, the, carpathian, germans, in, the, 13th, century, and, the, jews, in, the, 14th, century, a, significant, decline, in, the, population, resulted, from, the, invasion, of, the, mongols, in, 1241, and, the, subsequent, famine, however, in, medieval, times, the, area, of, slovakia, was, characterised, by, german, and, jewish, immigration, burgeoning, towns, construction, of, numerous, stone, castles, and, the, cultivation, of, the, arts, the, arrival, of, german, element, sometimes, proved, a, problem, for, the, autochthonous, slovaks, and, even, hungarians, in, the, broader, hungary, since, they, often, quickly, gained, most, power, in, medieval, towns, only, to, later, refuse, to, share, it, breaking, of, old, customs, by, germans, often, resulted, in, national, quarrels, one, of, which, had, to, be, sorted, out, by, the, king, louis, i, with, the, proclamation, privilegium, pro, slavis, privilege, for, slovaks, in, the, year, 1381, according, to, this, privilege, slovaks, and, germans, were, to, occupy, each, half, of, the,
