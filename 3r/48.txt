water, outflow, through, the, dardanelles, strait, analysis, of, the, aegean, during, 1991, and, 1992, revealed, three, distinct, water, masses, the, climate, of, the, aegean, sea, largely, reflects, the, climate, of, greece, and, western, turkey, which, is, to, say, predominantly, mediterranean, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, most, of, the, aegean, is, classified, as, hot, summer, mediterranean, csa, with, hotter, and, drier, summers, along, with, milder, and, wetter, winters, however, high, temperatures, during, summers, are, generally, not, quite, as, high, as, those, in, arid, or, semiarid, climates, due, to, the, presence, of, a, large, body, of, water, this, is, most, predominant, in, the, west, and, east, coasts, of, the, aegean, and, within, the, aegean, islands, in, the, north, of, the, aegean, sea, the, climate, is, instead, classified, as, cold, semi, arid, bsk, which, feature, cooler, summers, than, hot, summer, mediterranean, climates, the, etesian, winds, are, a, dominant, weather, influence, in, the, aegean, basin, the, below, table, lists, climate, conditions, of, some, major, aegean, cities, numerous, greek, and, turkish, settlements, are, located, along, their, mainland, coast, as, well, as, on, towns, on, the, aegean, islands, the, largest, cities, are, athens, and, thessaloniki, in, greece, and, zmir, in, turkey, the, most, populated, of, the, aegean, islands, is, crete, followed, by, euboea, and, rhodes, athens, zmir, thessaloniki, bodrum, greece, has, established, several, marine, protected, areas, along,

alonnisos, marine, park, while, the, missolonghi, aitoliko, lagoons, and, the, island, of, zakynthos, are, not, on, the, aegean, the, current, coastline, dates, back, to, about, 4000, bc, before, that, time, at, the, peak, of, the, last, ice, age, about, 18, 000, years, ago, sea, levels, everywhere, were, 130, metres, 430, ft, lower, and, there, were, large, well, watered, coastal, plains, instead, of, much, of, the, northern, aegean, when, they, were, first, occupied, the, present, day, islands, including, milos, with, its, important, obsidian, production, were, probably, still, connected, to, the, mainland, the, present, coastal, arrangement, appeared, around, 9, 000, years, ago, with, post, ice, age, sea, levels, continuing, to, rise, for, another, 3, 000, years, after, that, the, subsequent, bronze, age, civilizations, of, greece, and, the, aegean, sea, have, given, rise, to, the, general, term, aegean, civilization, in, ancient, times, the, sea, was, the, birthplace, of, two, ancient, civilizations, the, minoans, of, crete, and, the, mycenaeans, of, the, peloponnese, the, minoan, civilization, was, a, bronze, age, civilization, on, the, island, of, crete, and, other, aegean, islands, flourishing, from, around, 3000, to, 1450, bc, before, a, period, of, decline, finally, ending, at, around, 1100, bc, it, represented, the, first, advanced, civilization, in, europe, leaving, behind, massive, building, complexes, tools, stunning, artwork, writing, systems, and, a, massive, network, of, trade, the, minoan, period, saw, extensive, trade, between, crete, aegean, and, mediterranean, settlements, particularly, the, near, east, the, most, notable, minoan, palace, is, that, of, knossos, followed, by, that, of, phaistos, the, mycenaean, greeks, arose, on, the, mainland, becoming, the, first, advanced, civilization, in, mainland, greece, which, lasted, from, approximately, 1600, to, 1100, bc, it, is, believed, that, the, site, of, mycenae, which, sits, close, to, the, aegean, coast, was, the, center, of, mycenaean, civilization, the, mycenaeans, introduced, several, innovations, in, the, fields, of, engineering, architecture, and, military, infrastructure, while, trade, over, vast, areas, of, the, mediterranean, including, the, aegean, was, essential, for, the, mycenaean, economy, their, syllabic, script, the, linear, b, offers, the, first, written, records, of, the, greek, language, and, their, religion, already, included, several, deities, that, can, also, be, found, in, the, olympic, pantheon, mycenaean, greece, was, dominated, by, a, warrior, elite, society, and, consisted, of, a, network, of, palace, centered, states, that, developed, rigid, hierarchical, political, social, and, economic, systems, at, the, head, of, this, society, was, the, king, known, as, wanax, the, civilization, of, mycenaean, greeks, perished, with, the, collapse, of, bronze, age, culture, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, be, followed, by, the, so, called, greek, dark, ages, it, is, undetermined, what, cause, the, collapse, of, the, mycenaeans, during, the, greek, dark, ages, writing, in, the, linear, b, script, ceased, vital, trade, links, were, lost, and, towns, and, villages, were, abandoned, the, archaic, period, followed, the, greek, dark, ages, in, the, 8th, century, bc, greece, became, divided, into, small, self, governing, communities, and, adopted, the, phoenician, alphabet, modifying, it, to, create, the, greek, alphabet, by, the, 6th, century, bc, several, cities, had, emerged, as, dominant, in, greek, affairs, athens, sparta, corinth, and, thebes, of, which, athens, sparta, and, corinth, were, closest, to, the, aegean, sea, each, of, them, had, brought, the, surrounding, rural, areas, and, smaller, towns, under, their, control, and, athens, and, corinth, had, become, major, maritime, and, mercantile, powers, as, well, in, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, many, greeks, migrated, to, form, colonies, in, magna, graecia, southern, italy, and, sicily, asia, minor, and, further, afield, the, aegean, sea, was, the, setting, for, one, of, the, most, pivotal, naval, engagements, in, history, when, on, 20, september, 480, b, c, the, athenian, fleet, gained, a, decisive, victory, over, the, persian, fleet, of, the, xerxes, ii, of, persia, at, the, battle, of, salamis, thus, ending, any, further, attempt, of, western, expansion, by, the, achaemenid, empire, the, aegean, sea, would, later, come, to, be, under, the, control, albeit, briefly, of, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, philip, ii, and, his, son, alexander, the, great, led, a, series, of, conquests, that, led, not, only, to, the, unification, of, the, greek, mainland, and, the, control, of, the, aegean, sea, under, his, rule, but, also, the, destruction, of, the, achaemenid, empire, after, alexander, the, great, s, death, his, empire, was, divided, among, his, generals, cassander, became, king, of, the, hellenistic, kingdom, of, macedon, which, held, territory, along, the, western, coast, of, the, aegean, roughly, corresponding, to, modern, day, greece, the, kingdom, of, lysimachus, had, control, over, the, sea, s, eastern, coast, greece, had, entered, the, hellenistic, period, the, macedonian, wars, were, a, series, of, conflicts, fought, by, the, roman, republic, and, its, greek, allies, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, against, several, different, major, greek, kingdoms, they, resulted, in, roman, control, or, influence, over, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, including, the, aegean, in, addition, to, their, hegemony, in, the, western, mediterranean, after, the, punic, wars, during, roman, rule, the, land, around, the, aegean, sea, fell, under, the, provinces, of, achaea, macedonia, thracia, asia, and, creta, et, cyrenaica, island, of, crete, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, allowed, its, successor, state, the, byzantine, empire, to, continue, roman, control, over, the, aegean, sea, however, their, territory, would, later, be, threatened, by, the, early, muslim, conquests, initiated, by, muhammad, in, the, 7th, century, although, the, rashidun, caliphate, did, not, manage, to, obtain, land, along, the, coast, of, the, aegean, sea, its, conquest, of, the, eastern, anatolian, peninsula, as, well, as, egypt, the, levant, and, north, africa, left, the, byzantine, empire,

became, an, independent, islamic, state, the, byzantine, empire, launched, a, campaign, that, took, most, of, the, island, back, in, 842, and, 843, under, theoktistos, but, the, re, conquest, was, not, completed, and, was, soon, reversed, later, attempts, by, the, byzantine, empire, to, recover, the, island, were, without, success, for, the, approximately, 135, years, of, its, existence, the, emirate, of, crete, was, one, of, the, major, foes, of, byzantium, crete, commanded, the, sea, lanes, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, functioned, as, a, forward, base, and, haven, for, muslim,
