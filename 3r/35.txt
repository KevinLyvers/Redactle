the, international, date, line, idl, is, the, line, between, the, south, and, north, poles, that, is, the, boundary, between, one, calendar, day, and, the, next, it, passes, through, the, pacific, ocean, roughly, following, the, 180, 0, line, of, longitude, and, deviating, to, pass, around, some, territories, and, island, groups, crossing, the, date, line, eastbound, decreases, the, date, by, one, day, while, crossing, the, date, line, westbound, increases, the, date, the, line, is, a, cartographic, convention, and, is, not, defined, by, international, law, this, has, made, it, difficult, for, cartographers, to, agree, on, its, precise, course, and, has, allowed, countries, through, whose, waters, it, passes, to, move, it, at, times, for, their, convenience, people, traveling, westward, around, the, world, must, set, their, clocks, people, traveling, eastward, must, set, their, clocks, moving, forward, or, back, 24, hours, generally, also, implies, a, one, day, date, change, the, 14th, century, arab, geographer, abulfeda, predicted, that, circumnavigators, would, accumulate, a, one, day, offset, to, the, local, date, this, phenomenon, was, confirmed, in, 1522, at, the, end, of, the, magellan, elcano, expedition, the, first, successful, circumnavigation, after, sailing, westward, around, the, world, from, spain, the, expedition, called, at, cape, verde, for, provisions, on, wednesday, 9, july, 1522, ship, s, time, however, the, locals, told, them, that, it, was, actually, thursday, 10, july, 1522, the, crew, was, surprised, as, they, had, recorded, each, day, of, the, three, year, journey, without, omission, cardinal, gasparo, contarini, the, venetian, ambassador, to, spain, was, the, first, european, to, give, a, correct, explanation, of, the, discrepancy, the, idl, is, roughly, based, on, the, meridian, of, 180, longitude, roughly, down, the, middle, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, halfway, around, the, world, from, the, iers, reference, meridian, the, successor, to, the, historic, greenwich, prime, meridian, running, through, the, royal, greenwich, observatory, in, many, places, the, idl, follows, the, 180, meridian, exactly, in, other, places, however, the, idl, deviates, east, or, west, away, from, that, meridian, these, various, deviations, generally, accommodate, the, political, and, or, economic, affiliations, of, the, affected, areas, proceeding, from, north, to, south, the, first, deviation, of, the, idl, from, 180, is, to, pass, to, the, east, of, wrangel, island, and, the, chukchi, peninsula, the, easternmost, part, of, russian, siberia, wrangel, island, lies, directly, on, the, meridian, at, 71, 32, n, 180, 0, e, also, noted, as, 71, 32, n, 180, 0, w, it, then, passes, through, the, bering, strait, between, the, diomede, islands, at, a, distance, of, 1, 5, kilometres, 0, 93, mi, from, each, island, at, 168, 58, 37, w, it, then, bends, considerably, west, of, 180, passing, west, of, st, lawrence, island, and, st, matthew, island, the, idl, crosses, between, the, u, s, aleutian, islands, attu, island, being, the, westernmost, and, the, commander, islands, which, belong, to, russia, it, then, bends, southeast, again, to, return, to, 180, thus, all, of, russia, is, to, the, west, of, the, idl, and, all, of, the, united, states, is, to, the, east, except, for, the, insular, areas, of, guam, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, wake, island, reaching, the, hypothetical, but, not, used, utc, 13, 00, time, zone, the, idl, remains, on, the, 180, meridian, until, passing, the, equator, two, u, s, owned, uninhabited, atolls, howland, island, and, baker, island, just, north, of, the, equator, in, the, central, pacific, ocean, and, ships, at, sea, between, 172, 5, w, and, 180, have, the, earliest, time, on, earth, utc, 12, 00, hours, the, idl, circumscribes, kiribati, by, swinging, far, to, the, east, almost, reaching, the, 150, w, meridian, kiribati, s, easternmost, islands, the, southern, line, islands, south, of, hawaii, have, the, latest, time, on, earth, utc, 14, 00, hours, south, of, kiribati, the, idl, returns, westwards, but, remains, east, of, 180, passing, between, samoa, and, american, samoa, accordingly, samoa, tokelau, wallis, and, futuna, fiji, tonga, tuvalu, and, new, zealand, s, kermadec, islands, and, chatham, islands, are, all, west, of, the, idl, and, have, the, same, date, american, samoa, the, cook, islands, niue, and, french, polynesia, are, east, of, the, idl, and, one, day, behind, the, idl, then, bends, southwest, to, return, to, 180, it, follows, that, meridian, until, reaching, antarctica, which, has, multiple, time, zones, conventionally, the, idl, is, not, drawn, into, antarctica, on, most, maps, see, cartographic, practice, and, convention, below, according, to, the, clock, the, first, areas, to, experience, a, new, day, and, a, new, year, are, islands, that, use, utc, 14, 00, these, include, portions, of, the, republic, of, kiribati, including, millennium, island, in, the, line, islands, the, first, major, cities, to, experience, a, new, day, are, auckland, and, wellington, new, zealand, utc, 12, 00, utc, 13, 00, with, daylight, saving, time, a, 1994, realignment, of, the, idl, made, caroline, island, one, of, the, first, points, of, land, on, earth, to, reach, january, 1, 2000, on, the, calendar, utc, 14, 00, as, a, result, this, atoll, was, renamed, millennium, island, the, areas, that, are, the, first, to, see, the, daylight, of, a, new, day, vary, by, the, season, around, the, june, soltices, the, first, area, would, be, any, place, within, the, kamchatka, time, zone, utc, 12, 00, that, is, far, enough, north, to, experience, midnight, sun, on, the, given, date, at, the, equinoxes, the, first, place, to, see, daylight, would, be, the, uninhabited, millennium, island, in, kiribati, which, is, the, easternmost, land, located, west, of, the, idl, near, the, december, solstice, the, first, places, would, be, antarctic, research, stations, using, new, zealand, time, utc, 13, 00, during, summer, that, experience, midnight, sun, these, include, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, mcmurdo, station, scott, base, and, zucchelli, station, there, are, two, ways, time, zones, and, thereby, the, location, of, the, international, date, line, are, determined, one, on, land, and, adjacent, territorial, waters, and, the, other, on, open, seas, all, nations, unilaterally, determine, their, standard, time, zones, applicable, only, on, land, and, adjacent, territorial, waters, this, date, line, can, be, called, de, facto, since, it, is, not, based, on, international, law, but, on, national, laws, these, national, zones, do, not, extend, into, international, waters, the, nautical, date, line, not, the, same, as, the, idl, is, a, de, jure, construction, determined, by, international, agreement, it, is, the, result, of, the, 1917, anglo, french, conference, on, time, keeping, at, sea, which, recommended, that, all, ships, both, military, and, civilian, adopt, hourly, standard, time, zones, on, the, high, seas, the, united, states, adopted, its, recommendation, for, u, s, military, and, merchant, marine, ships, in, 1920, this, date, line, is, implied, but, not, explicitly, drawn, on, time, zone, maps, it, follows, the, 180, meridian, except, where, it, is, interrupted, by, territorial, waters, adjacent, to, land, forming, gaps, it, is, a, pole, to, pole, dashed, line, the, 15, gore, that, is, offset, from, utc, by, 12, hours, is, bisected, by, the, nautical, date, line, into, two, 7, 5, gores, that, differ, from, utc, by, 12, hours, in, theory, ships, are, supposed, to, adopt, the, standard, time, of, a, country, if, they, are, within, its, territorial, waters, within, 12, nautical, miles, 14, mi, 22, km, of, land, then, revert, to, international, time, zones, 15, wide, pole, to, pole, gores, as, soon, as, they, leave, in, practice, ships, use, these, time, zones, only, for, radio, communication, and, similar, purposes, for, internal, within, ship, purposes, such, as, work, and, meal, hours, ships, use, a, time, zone, of, their, own, choosing, the, idl, on, the, map, in, this, article, and, all, other, maps, is, based, on, the, de, facto, line, and, is, an, artificial, construct, of, cartographers, as, the, precise, course, of, the, line, in, international, waters, is, arbitrary, the, idl, does, not, extend, into, antarctica, on, the, world, time, zone, maps, by, the, united, states, central, intelligence, agency, cia, or, the, united, kingdom, s, his, majesty, s, nautical, almanac, office, hmnao, the, idl, on, modern, cia, maps, now, reflects, the, most, recent, shifts, in, the, idl, see, historic, alterations, below, the, current, hmnao, map, does, not, draw, the, idl, in, conformity, with, recent, shifts, in, the, idl, it, draws, a, line, virtually, identical, to, that, adopted, by, the, uk, s, hydrographic, office, about, 1900, instead, hmnao, labels, island, groups, with, their, time, zones, which, do, reflect, the, most, recent, idl, shifts, this, approach, is, consistent, with, the, principle, of, national, and, nautical, time, zones, the, islands, of, eastern, kiribati, are, actually, islands, of, asian, date, west, side, of, idl, in, a, sea, of, american, date, east, side, of, idl, similarly, the, western, aleutian, islands, are, islands, of, american, date, in, a, sea, of, asian, date, no, international, organization, nor, any, treaty, between, nations, has, fixed, the, idl, drawn, by, cartographers, the, 1884, international, meridian, conference, explicitly, refused, to, propose, or, agree, to, any, time, zones, stating, that, they, were, outside, its, purview, the, conference, resolved, that, the, universal, day, midnight, to, midnight, greenwich, mean, time, now, redefined, and, updated, as, coordinated, universal, time, or, utc, which, it, did, agree, to, shall, not, interfere, with, the, use, of, local, or, standard, time, where, desirable, from, this, comes, the, utility, and, importance, of, utc, or, z, zulu, time, it, permits, a, single, universal, reference, for, time, that, is, valid, for, all, points, on, the, globe, at, the, same, moment, ferdinand, magellan, claimed, the, philippines, for, spain, on, saturday, 16, march, 1521, having, sailed, westwards, from, seville, across, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, pacific, ocean, as, part, of, new, spain, the, philippines, had, its, most, important, communication, with, acapulco, in, mexico, so, it, was, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, idl, despite, being, on, the, western, edge, of, the, pacific, ocean, as, a, result, the, philippines, was, one, day, behind, its, asian, neighbours, for, 323, years, 9, months, and, 2, weeks, from, saturday, 16, march, 1521, julian, calendar, until, monday, 30, december, 1844, gregorian, calendar, after, mexico, gained, its, independence, from, spain, on, 27, september, 1821, philippine, trade, interests, turned, to, imperial, china, the, dutch, east, indies, and, adjacent, areas, so, the, philippines, decided, to, join, its, asian, neighbours, on, the, west, side, of, the, idl, to, advance, the, calendar, by, one, day, on, 16, august, 1844, the, then, governor, general, narciso, claveria, ordered, that, tuesday, 31, december, 1844, should, be, removed, from, the, calendar, monday, 30, december, 1844, was, followed, immediately, by, wednesday, 1, january, 1845, the, change, also, applied, to, the, other, remaining, spanish, colonies, in, the, pacific, the, caroline, islands, guam, mariana, islands, marshall, islands, and, palau, as, part, of, the, captaincy, general, of, the, philippines, western, publications, were, generally, unaware, of, this, change, until, the, early, 1890s, so, they, erroneously, gave, the, international, date, line, a, large, western, bulge, for, the, next, half, century, on, 5, march, 1797, missionaries, of, the, london, missionary, society, arrived, on, tahiti, from, england, they, had, first, tried, to, pass, cape, horn, but, failing, that, went, along, cape, of, good, hope, and, the, indian, ocean, instead, as, such, they, introduced, the, date, of, the, eastern, hemisphere, on, the, island, it, was, not, until, the, ending, of, the, franco, tahitian, war, and, the, restoration, of, the, french, protectorate, over, the, tahitian, kingdom, which, tahitian, nationalists, had, tried, to, fight, off, for, two, years, of, intense, war, with, more, than, 1000, deaths, that, the, french, commissioner, armand, joseph, bruat, and, the, regent, of, the, tahitian, kingdom, paraita, ordered, that, tahiti, had, to, follow, the, western, hemisphere, on, 29, december, 1846, alaska, was, on, the, western, side, of, the, international, date, line, since, russian, settlers, reached, alaska, from, siberia, in, addition, the, russian, empire, was, still, using, the, julian, calendar, which, had, fallen, 12, days, behind, the, gregorian, calendar, in, 1867, the, united, states, purchased, russian, america, and, moved, the, territory, to, the, east, side, of, the, international, date, line, the, transfer, ceremony, took, place, at, 3, 30, p, m, local, mean, time, 00, 31, gmt, in, the, capital, of, new, archangel, sitka, on, saturday, 7, october, 1867, julian, which, was, saturday, 19, october, 1867, gregorian, in, europe, since, alaska, moved, to, the, eastern, side, of, the, international, date, line, the, date, and, time, also, moved, back, to, 3, 30, p, m, local, time, friday, 18, october, 1867, 00, 31, gmt, saturday, now, known, as, alaska, day, the, samoan, islands, now, divided, into, samoa, and, american, samoa, were, on, the, west, side, of, the, idl, until, 1892, in, that, year, king, m, lietoa, laupepa, was, persuaded, by, american, traders, to, adopt, the, american, date, three, hours, behind, california, to, replace, the, former, asian, date, four, hours, ahead, of, japan, the, change, was, made, by, repeating, monday, 4, july, 1892, american, independence, day, in, 2011, samoa, shifted, back, to, the, west, side, of, the, idl, by, removing, friday, 30, december, 2011, from, its, calendar, this, changed, the, time, zone, from, utc, 11, 00, to, utc, 13, 00, utc, 10, to, utc, 14, dst, samoa, made, the, change, because, australia, and, new, zealand, have, become, its, biggest, trading, partners, and, also, have, large, communities, of, expatriates, being, 21, hours, behind, made, business, difficult, because, having, weekends, on, backward, days, meant, only, four, days, of, the, week, were, shared, workdays, the, idl, now, passes, between, samoa, and, american, samoa, which, remains, on, the, east, american, side, of, the, line, tokelau, is, a, territory, of, new, zealand, north, of, samoa, whose, principal, transportation, and, communications, links, with, the, rest, of, the, world, pass, through, samoa, for, that, reason, tokelau, crossed, the, idl, along, with, samoa, in, 2011, albeit, strictly, speaking, 1, hour, later, as, they, did, not, do, summer, time, daylight, saving, time, in, american, english, which, samoa, did, then, kwajalein, atoll, like, the, rest, of, the, marshall, islands, passed, from, spanish, to, german, to, japanese, control, during, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, during, that, period, it, was, west, of, the, idl, although, kwajalein, formally, became, part, of, the, trust, territory, of, the, pacific, islands, with, the, rest, of, the, marshalls, after, world, war, ii, the, united, states, established, a, military, installation, there, because, of, that, kwajalein, used, the, hawaiian, date, so, was, effectively, east, of, the, international, date, line, unlike, the, rest, of, the, marshalls, kwajalein, returned, to, the, west, side, of, the, idl, by, removing, saturday, 21, august, 1993, from, its, calendar, moreover, kwajalein, s, work, week, was, changed, to, tuesday, through, saturday, to, match, the, hawaiian, work, week, of, monday, through, friday, on, the, other, side, of, the, idl, as, a, british, colony, the, kiribati, colony, was, centered, in, the, gilbert, islands, just, west, of, the, idl, of, the, time, upon, independence, in, 1979, it, acquired, the, claim, to, the, phoenix, and, line, islands, east, of, the, idl, from, the, united, states, as, a, result, the, country, straddled, the, idl, government, and, commercial, concerns, on, opposite, sides, of, the, line, could, only, conduct, routine, business, by, radio, or, telephone, on, the, four, days, of, the, week, which, were, weekdays, on, both, sides, to, eliminate, this, anomaly, kiribati, introduced, a, change, of, date, for, its, eastern, half, by, removing, saturday, 31, december, 1994, from, its, calendar, because, of, this, friday, 30, december, 1994, was, followed, by, sunday, 1, january, 1995, after, the, change, the, idl, in, effect, moved, eastwards, to, go, around, the, entire, country, strictly, legal, the, 1917, nautical, idl, convention, is, still, valid, for, example, when, it, is, monday, on, kiribati, s, islands, it, is, still, sunday, in, the, surrounding, ocean, though, maps, are, usually, not, drawn, this, way, as, a, consequence, of, the, 1994, change, kiribati, s, easternmost, territory, the, line, islands, including, the, inhabited, island, of, kiritimati, christmas, island, started, the, year, 2000, before, any, other, country, a, feature, upon, which, the, kiribati, government, capitalized, as, a, potential, tourist, draw, generally, the, christian, calendar, and, christian, churches, recognize, the, idl, christmas, for, example, is, celebrated, on, 25, december, according, to, either, the, gregorian, or, the, julian, calendar, depending, upon, which, of, the, two, is, used, by, the, particular, church, as, that, date, falls, in, countries, located, on, either, side, of, the, idl, thus, whether, it, is, western, christmas, or, orthodox, christmas, christians, in, samoa, immediately, west, of, the, idl, will, celebrate, the, holiday, a, day, before, christians, in, american, samoa, which, is, immediately, east, of, the, idl, a, problem, with, the, general, rule, above, arises, in, certain, christian, churches, that, solemnly, observe, a, sabbath, day, as, a, particular, day, of, the, week, when, those, churches, are, located, in, countries, near, the, idl, notwithstanding, the, difference, in, dates, the, same, sunrise, happened, over, american, samoa, as, happens, over, samoa, a, few, minutes, later, and, the, same, sunset, happens, over, samoa, as, happened, over, american, samoa, a, few, minutes, earlier, in, other, words, the, secular, days, are, legally, different, but, they, are, physically, the, same, that, causes, questions, to, arise, under, religious, law, because, the, idl, is, an, arbitrary, imposition, the, question, can, arise, as, to, which, saturday, on, either, side, of, the, idl, or, more, fundamentally, on, either, side, of, 180, degrees, longitude, is, the, real, saturday, this, issue, which, also, arises, in, judaism, is, a, particular, problem, for, seventh, day, adventists, seventh, day, baptists, and, similar, churches, located, in, countries, near, the, idl, in, tonga, seventh, day, adventists, who, usually, observe, saturday, the, seventh, day, sabbath, observe, sunday, because, tonga, lies, east, of, the, 180, meridian, sunday, as, observed, in, tonga, west, of, the, idl, as, with, kiribati, samoa, and, parts, of, fiji, and, tuvalu, is, considered, by, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, to, be, the, same, day, as, saturday, observed, east, of, the, idl, most, seventh, day, adventists, in, samoa, planned, to, observe, sabbath, on, sunday, after, samoa, s, crossing, the, idl, in, december, 2011, but, sda, groups, in, samatau, village, and, other, places, approximately, 300, members, decided, to, accept, the, idl, adjustment, and, observe, the, sabbath, on, saturday, debate, continues, within, the, seventh, day, adventist, community, in, the, pacific, as, to, which, day, is, really, the, seventh, day, sabbath, the, samoan, independent, seventh, day, adventist, church, which, is, not, affiliated, to, the, worldwide, seventh, day, adventist, church, has, decided, to, continue, worshiping, on, saturday, after, a, six, day, week, at, the, end, of, 2011, the, islamic, calendar, and, muslim, communities, recognize, the, convention, of, the, idl, in, particular, the, day, for, holding, the, jumu, ah, prayer, appears, to, be, local, friday, everywhere, in, the, world, the, idl, is, not, a, factor, in, the, start, and, end, of, islamic, lunar, months, these, depend, solely, on, sighting, the, new, crescent, moon, as, an, example, the, fasts, of, the, month, of, ramadan, begin, the, morning, after, the, crescent, is, sighted, that, this, day, may, vary, in, different, parts, of, the, world, is, well, known, in, islam, see, ramadan, beginning, the, concept, of, an, international, date, line, in, jewish, law, is, first, mentioned, by, 12th, century, decisors, but, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, improved, transportation, and, communications, systems, in, the, 20th, century, that, the, question, of, an, international, date, line, truly, became, a, question, of, practical, jewish, law, as, a, practical, matter, the, conventional, international, date, line, or, another, line, in, the, pacific, ocean, close, to, it, serves, as, a, de, facto, date, line, for, purposes, of, jewish, law, at, least, in, existing, jewish, communities, for, example, residents, of, the, jewish, communities, of, japan, new, zealand, hawaii, and, french, polynesia, all, observe, shabbat, on, local, saturday, however, there, is, not, unanimity, as, to, how, jewish, law, reaches, that, conclusion, for, this, reason, some, authorities, rule, that, certain, aspects, of, sabbath, observance, are, required, on, sunday, in, japan, and, new, zealand, or, friday, in, hawaii, and, french, polynesia, in, addition, to, saturday, additionally, there, are, differences, of, opinion, as, to, which, day, or, days, individual, jews, traveling, in, the, pacific, region, away, from, established, jewish, communities, should, observe, shabbat, for, individuals, crossing, the, idl, the, change, of, calendar, date, influences, some, aspects, of, practice, under, jewish, law, yet, other, aspects, depend, on, an, individual, s, experience, of, sunsets, and, sunrises, to, count, days, notwithstanding, the, calendar, date, the, idl, is, a, central, factor, in, umberto, eco, s, book, the, island, of, the, day, before, 1994, in, which, the, protagonist, finds, himself, on, a, becalmed, ship, with, an, island, close, at, hand, on, the, other, side, of, the, idl, unable, to, swim, the, protagonist, indulges, in, increasingly, imaginative, speculation, regarding, the, physical, metaphysical, and, religious, importance, of, the, idl, the, concept, behind, the, idl, though, not, the, idl, itself, which, did, not, yet, exist, appears, as, a, plot, device, in, jules, verne, s, book, around, the, world, in, eighty, days, 1873, the, main, protagonist, phileas, fogg, travels, eastward, around, the, world, he, had, bet, with, his, friends, that, he, could, do, it, in, 80, days, to, win, the, wager, fogg, must, return, by, 8, 45, p, m, on, saturday, 21, december, 1872, however, the, journey, suffers, a, series, of, delays, and, when, fogg, reaches, london, it, is, 8, 50, p, m, on, friday, 20, december, although, he, believes, it, is, saturday, 21, december, and, that, he, has, lost, the, wager, by, a, margin, of, only, five, minutes, the, next, day, however, it, is, revealed, that, the, day, is, saturday, not, sunday, and, fogg, arrives, at, his, club, just, in, time, to, win, the, bet, verne, explains, in, journeying, eastward, he, had, gone, towards,

circumference, of, the, earth, and, these, three, hundred, and, sixty, degrees, multiplied, by, four, minutes, gives, precisely, twenty, four, hours, that, is, the, day, unconsciously, gained, in, other, words, while, phileas, fogg, going, eastward, saw, the, sun, pass, the, meridian, eighty, times, his, friends, in, london, only, saw, it, pass, the, meridian, seventy, nine, times, fogg, had, thought, it, was, one, day, later, than, it, actually, was, because, he, had, not, accounted, for, this, fact, during, his, journey, he, had, added, a, full, day, to, his, clock, at, the, rhythm, of, an, hour, per, fifteen, degrees, or, four, minutes, per, degree, as, verne, writes, at, the, time, the, concept, of, a, de, jure, international, date, line, did, not, exist, if, it, did, he, would, have, been, made, aware, that, it, would, be, a, day, less, than, it, used, to, be, once, he, reached, this, line, thus, the, day, he, would, add, to, his, clock, throughout, his, journey, would, be, thoroughly, removed, upon, crossing, this, imaginary, line, but, a, de, facto, date, line, did, exist, since, the, u, k, india, and, the, u, s, had, the, same, calendar, with, different, local, times, and, he, should, have, noticed, when, he, arrived, in, the, u, s, that, the, local, date, was, not, the, same, as, in, his, diary, his, servant, jean, passepartout, kept, his, watch, set, to, london, time, despite, the, clues, from, his, surroundings, ceremonies, aboard, ships, to, mark, a, sailor, s, or, passenger, s, first, crossing, of, the, equator, as, well, as, crossing, the, international,
