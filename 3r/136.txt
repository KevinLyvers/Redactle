river, splits, into, more, than, one, arm, after, the, large, irtysh, flows, into, it, at, about, 69, e, originating, in, china, the, irtysh, is, the, furthest, source, of, the, ob, from, their,

navigable, waters, within, the, ob, basin, reach, a, total, length, of, 15, 000, km, 9, 300, mi, the, importance, of, navigation, in, the, ob, basin, for, transport, was, particularly, great, before, the, completion, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, since, despite, the, general, south, to, north, direction, of, the, flow, of, ob, and, most, of, its, tributaries, the, width, of, the, ob, basin, provided, for, somewhat, indirect, transport, in, the, east, west, direction, as, well, the, novgorodians, were, aware, of, the, lands, of, western, siberia, from, at, least, the, 11th, century, which, were, designated, by, the, russian, word, yugra, novgorod, established, two, trade, routes, to, the, ob, river, both, starting, from, the, town, of, ustyug, the, first, route, went, along, the, sukhona, and, vychegda, then, along, the, usa, to, the, lower, reaches, of, the, ob, the, second, route, went, down, the, northern, dvina, then, along, the, coasts, of, the, white, sea, and, kara, sea, before, reaching, the, mouth, of, the, ob, the, russian, settlements, of, beryozov, and, obdorsk, were, founded, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, on, the, lower, reaches, of, the, ob, while, surgut, was, founded, on, the, middle, course, of, the, ob, until, the, early, 20th, century, a, particularly, important, western, river, port, was, tyumen, located, on, the, tura, a, tributary, of, the, tobol, reached, by, an, extension, of, the, yekaterinburg, perm, railway, in, 1885, and, thus, obtaining, a, rail, link, to, the, kama, and, volga, rivers, in, the, heart, of, russia, tyumen, became, an, important, railhead, for, some, years, until, the, railway, extended, further, east, in, the, eastern, reaches, of, the, ob, basin, tomsk, on, the, tom, functioned, as, an, important, terminus, tyumen, had, its, first, steamboat, in, 1836, and, steamboats, have, navigated, the, middle, reaches, of, the, ob, since, 1845, in, 1916, there, were, 49, steamers, on, the, ob, 10, on, the, yenisei, in, an, attempt, to, extend, the, ob, navigable, system, even, further, a, system, of, canals, utilising, the, ket, 900, km, 560, mi, long, in, all, was, built, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, connect, the, ob, with, the, yenisei, but, soon, abandoned, as, being, uncompetitive, with, the, railway, the, trans, siberian, railway, once, completed, provided, for, more, direct, year, round, transport, in, the, east, west, direction, but, the, ob, river, system, still, remained, important, for, connecting, the, huge, expanses, of, tyumen, oblast, and, tomsk, oblast, with, the, major, cities, along, the, trans, siberian, route, such, as, novosibirsk, or, omsk, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, construction, of, rail, links, to, labytnangi, tobolsk, and, the, oil, and, gas, cities, of, surgut, and, nizhnevartovsk, provided, more, railheads, but, did, not, diminish, the, importance, of, the, waterways, for, reaching, places, still, not, served, by, the, rail, a, dam, built, near, novosibirsk, in, 1956, created, the, then, largest, artificial, lake, in, siberia, called, novosibirsk, reservoir, from, the, 1960s, through, 1980s, soviet, engineers, and, administrators, contemplated, a, gigantic, project, to, divert, some, of, the, waters, of, ob, and, irtysh, to, kazakhstan, and, the, soviet, central, asian, republics, replenishing, the, aral, sea, as, well, the, project, never, left, the, drawing, board, abandoned, in, 1986, for, economic, and, environmental, considerations, the, water, in, the, river, is, significantly, polluted, in, the, lower, reaches, the, maximum, permissible, concentrations, of, petroleum, products, are, exceeded, by, 9, 10, times, the, oxygen, content, in, the, water, is, 4, times, lower, than, normal, the, irtysh, is, the, major, tributary, of, the, ob, the, larger, tributaries, along, its, course, are, in, addition, the, nadym, and, the, pur, river, flow, into, the, gulf, of, ob, and, the, taz, into, the, taz, estuary, a, side, arm, of, the, gulf, of, ob, cities, along, the, river, include, from, a, confluence, to, a, source
