southeast, asia, furthermore, as, the, cham, people, fled, the, vietnamese, one, of, the, earliest, locations, that, they, established, a, relationship, was, with, aceh, furthermore, it, is, thought, that, one, of, the, earliest, centers, of, islam, was, in, the, aceh, region, when, venetian, traveller, marco, polo, passed, by, sumatra, on, his, way, home, from, china, in, 1292, he, found, that,

gravestone, of, sultan, malik, as, salih, the, first, muslim, ruler, of, samudra, has, been, found, and, is, dated, ah, 696, ad, 1297, this, is, the, earliest, clear, evidence, of, a, muslim, dynasty, in, the, indonesia, malay, area, and, more, gravestones, from, the, 13th, century, show, that, this, region, continued, under, muslim, rule, ibn, batutah, a, moroccan, traveller, passing, through, on, his, way, to, china, in, 1345, and, 1346, found, that, the, ruler, of, samudra, was, a, follower, of, the, shafi, i, school, of, islam, after, the, initial, appearance, of, islam, in, aceh, it, further, spread, into, the, coastal, regions, by, the, 15th, century, aceh, soon, became, a, cultural, and, scholastic, islamic, center, throughout, southeast, asia, it, also, became, wealthy, because, it, was, a, center, of, extensive, trade, the, portuguese, apothecary, tome, pires, reported, in, his, early, 16th, century, book, suma, oriental, that, most, of, the, kings, of, sumatra, from, aceh, through, palembang, were, muslim, at, pasai, in, what, is, now, the, north, aceh, regency, there, was, a, thriving, international, port, pires, attributed, the, establishment, of, islam, in, pasai, to, the, cunning, of, the, muslim, merchants, the, ruler, of, pasai, however, had, not, been, able, to, convert, the, people, of, the, interior, the, sultanate, of, aceh, was, established, by, sultan, ali, mughayat, syah, in, 1511, in, 1584, 88, the, bishop, of, malacca, d, jo, o, ribeiro, gaio, based, on, information, provided, by, a, former, captive, called, diogo, gil, wrote, the, roteiro, das, cousas, do, achem, lisboa, 1997, a, description, of, the, sultanate, later, during, its, golden, era, in, the, 17th, century, its, territory, and, political, influence, expanded, as, far, as, satun, in, southern, thailand, johor, in, malay, peninsula, and, siak, in, what, is, today, the, province, of, riau, as, was, the, case, with, most, non, javan, pre, colonial, states, acehnese, power, expanded, outward, by, sea, rather, than, inland, as, it, expanded, down, the, sumatran, coast, its, main, competitors, were, johor, and, portuguese, malacca, on, the, other, side, of, the, straits, of, malacca, it, was, this, seaborne, trade, focus, that, saw, aceh, rely, on, rice, imports, from, north, java, rather, than, develop, self, sufficiency, in, rice, production, after, the, portuguese, occupation, of, malacca, in, 1511, many, islamic, traders, passing, the, malacca, straits, shifted, their, trade, to, banda, aceh, and, increased, the, acehnese, rulers, wealth, during, the, reign, of, sultan, iskandar, muda, in, the, 17th, century, aceh, s, influence, extended, to, most, of, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, aceh, allied, itself, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, their, struggle, against, the, portuguese, and, the, johor, sultanate, acehnese, military, power, waned, gradually, thereafter, and, aceh, ceded, its, territory, of, pariaman, in, sumatra, to, the, dutch, in, the, 18th, century, by, the, early, 19th, century, however, aceh, had, become, an, increasingly, influential, power, due, to, its, strategic, location, for, controlling, regional, trade, in, the, 1820s, it, was, the, producer, of, over, half, the, world, s, supply, of, black, pepper, the, pepper, trade, produced, new, wealth, for, the, sultanate, and, for, the, rulers, of, many, smaller, nearby, ports, that, had, been, under, aceh, s, control, but, were, now, able, to, assert, more, independence, these, changes, initially, threatened, aceh, s, integrity, but, a, new, sultan, tuanku, ibrahim, who, controlled, the, kingdom, from, 1838, to, 1870, reasserted, power, over, nearby, ports, under, the, anglo, dutch, treaty, of, 1824, the, british, ceded, their, colonial, possessions, on, sumatra, to, the, dutch, in, the, treaty, the, british, described, aceh, as, one, of, their, possessions, although, they, had, no, actual, control, over, the, sultanate, initially, under, the, agreement, the, dutch, agreed, to, respect, aceh, s, independence, in, 1871, however, the, british, dropped, previous, opposition, to, a, dutch, invasion, of, aceh, possibly, to, prevent, france, or, the, united, states, from, gaining, a, foothold, in, the, region, although, neither, the, dutch, nor, the, british, knew, the, specifics, there, had, been, rumors, since, the, 1850s, that, aceh, had, been, in, communication, with, the, rulers, of, france, and, of, the, ottoman, empire, pirates, operating, from, aceh, threatened, commerce, in, the, strait, of, malacca, the, sultan, was, unable, to, control, them, britain, was, a, protector, of, aceh, and, gave, the, netherlands, permission, to, eradicate, the, pirates, the, campaign, quickly, drove, out, the, sultan, but, the, local, leaders, mobilized, and, fought, the, dutch, in, four, decades, of, guerrilla, war, with, high, levels, of, atrocities, the, dutch, colonial, government, declared, war, on, aceh, on, 26, march, 1873, aceh, sought, american, help, but, washington, rejected, the, request, the, dutch, tried, one, strategy, after, another, over, the, course, of, four, decades, an, expedition, under, major, general, johan, harmen, rudolf, k, hler, in, 1873, occupied, most, of, the, coastal, areas, k, hler, s, strategy, was, to, attack, and, take, the, sultan, s, palace, it, failed, the, dutch, then, tried, a, naval, blockade, reconciliation, concentration, within, a, line, of, forts, and, lastly, passive, containment, they, had, scant, success, reaching, 15, to, 20, million, guilders, a, year, the, heavy, spending, for, failed, strategies, nearly, bankrupted, the, colonial, government, during, the, course, of, the, war, the, dutch, set, up, the, gouvernment, of, atjeh, and, dependencies, under, a, governor, although, it, did, not, establish, wider, control, of, its, territory, until, after, 1908, the, aceh, army, was, rapidly, modernized, and, aceh, soldiers, killed, k, hler, k, hler, made, some, grave, tactical, errors, and, the, reputation, of, the, dutch, was, severely, harmed, in, recent, years, in, line, with, expanding, international, attention, to, human, rights, issues, and, atrocities, in, war, zones, there, has, been, increasing, discussion, about, some, of, the, recorded, acts, of, cruelty, and, slaughter, committed, by, dutch, troops, during, the, period, of, warfare, in, aceh, hasan, mustafa, 1852, 1930, was, a, chief, penghulu, or, judge, for, the, colonial, government, and, was,

independent, indonesia, a, situation, created, by, a, complex, mix, of, what, the, acehnese, regarded, as, transgressions, against, and, betrayals, of, their, rights, sukarno, the, first, president, of, indonesia, had, reneged, on, his, promise, made, on, 16, june, 1948, that, aceh, would, be, allowed, to, rule, itself, in, accordance, with, islamic, law, aceh, was, politically, dismantled, and, incorporated, into, the, province, of, north, sumatra, in, 1950, this, resulted, in, the, acehnese, rebellion, of, 1953, 59, which, was, led, by, daud, beureu, eh, who, on, 20, september, 1953, declared, a, free, independent, aceh, under, the, leadership, of, sekarmadji, maridjan, kartosoewirjo, in, 1959, the, indonesian, government, attempted, to, placate, the, acehnese, by, offering, wide,

and, di, tiro, himself, had, to, live, in, exile, in, sweden, meanwhile, the, province, followed, suharto, s, policy, of, economic, development, and, industrialization, during, the, late, 1980s, several, security, incidents, prompted, the, indonesian, central, government, to, take, repressive, measures, and, to, send, troops, to, aceh, human, rights, abuse, was, rampant, for, the, next, decade, resulting, in, many, grievances, on, the, part, of, the, acehnese, toward, the, indonesian, central, government, in, 1990, the, indonesian, government, initiated, military, operations, against, gam, by, deploying, more, than, 12, 000, indonesian, troops, in, the, region, during, the, late, 1990s, chaos, in, java, and, an, ineffective, central, government, gave, an, advantage, to, the, free, aceh, movement, and, resulted, in, the, second, phase, of, the, rebellion, this, time, with, large, support, from, the, acehnese, people, this, support, was, demonstrated, during, the, 1999, plebiscite, in, banda, aceh, which, was, attended, by, nearly, half, a, million, people, of, four, million, population, of, the, province, the, indonesian, central, government, responded, in, 2001, by, broadening, aceh, s, autonomy, giving, its, government, the, right, to, apply, sharia, law, more, broadly, and, the, right, to, receive, direct, foreign, investment, this, was, again, accompanied, by, repressive, measures, however, and, in, 2003, an, offensive, began, and, a, state, of, emergency, was, proclaimed, in, the, province, the, war, was, still, ongoing, when, the, tsunami, disaster, of, 2004, struck, the, province, in, 2001, villagers, from, the, north, aceh, regency, sued, exxonmobil, for, human, rights, abuses, at, the, hands, of, indonesian, military, units,

shut, down, its, arun, natural, gas, operations, in, the, province, the, western, coastal, areas, of, aceh, including, the, cities, of, banda, aceh, calang, and, meulaboh, were, among, the, areas, hardest, hit, by, the, tsunami, resulting, from, the, magnitude, 9, 2, indian, ocean, earthquake, on, 26, december, 2004, while, estimates, vary, over, 170, 000, people, were, killed, by, tsunami, in, aceh, and, about, 500, 000, were, left, homeless, the, tragedy, of, the, tsunami, was, further, compounded, several, months, later, when, the, 2005, m8, 6, nias, simeulue, earthquake, struck, the, sea, bed, between, the, islands, of, simeulue, island, in, aceh, and, nias, in, north, sumatra, this, second, quake, killed, a, further, 1346, people, on, nias, and, simeulue, displaced, tens, of, thousands, more, and, caused, the, tsunami, response, to, be, expanded, to, include, nias, the, world, health, organisation, estimates, a, 100, increase, in, prevalence, of, mild, and, moderate, mental, disorders, in, aceh, s, general, population, after, the, tsunami, the, pacific, tsunami, warning, center, misjudging, the, intensity, of, the, sumatra, earthquake, sent, out, a, bulletin, that, no, tsunami, was, expected, following, a, magnitude, 8, 0, quake, based, on, historical, data, only, when, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, quakes, 9, 0, magnitude, became, available, did, scientists, at, the, warning, center, realize, they, were, dealing, with, a, basin, wide, tsunami, across, the, indian, ocean, when, the, tsunami, hit, it, was, enormous, and, the, death, toll, in, aceh, exceeded, 100, 000, there, was, no, tsunami, warning, system, in, 2004, tsunami, warning, systems, have, improved, since, the, immense, death, toll, drew, international, notice, but, in, rural, areas, where, many, don, t, have, internet, access, or, cell, phones, it, remains, a, challenge, to, communicate, warnings, in, a, timely, manner, a, warning, system, was, put, in, place, at, the, request, of, aceh, residents, but, it, was, disabled, in, 2007, after, technical, issues, and, a, false, alarm, that, caused, a, panic, the, population, of, aceh, before, the, december, 2004, tsunami, was, 4, 271, 000, 2004, the, population, as, of, 15, september, 2005, was, 4, 031, 589, and, in, january, 2014, was, 4, 731, 705, the, 2020, census, produced, a, total, population, of, 5, 274, 871, comprising, 2, 647, 563, males, and, 2, 627, 308, females, as, of, february, 2006, more, than, a, year, after, the, tsunami, a, large, number, of, people, were, still, living, in, barrack, style, temporary, living, centers, tlc, or, tents, reconstruction, was, visible, everywhere, but, due, to, the, sheer, scale, of, the, disaster, and, logistic, difficulties, progress, was, slow, a, study, in, 2007, estimated, that, 83, 6, of, the, population, had, a, psychiatric, illness, while, 69, 8, suffers, from, severe, emotional, distress, the, ramifications, of, the, tsunami, went, beyond, the, immediate, impact, to, the, lives, and, infrastructure, of, the, acehnese, living, on, the, coast, since, the, disaster, the, acehnese, rebel, movement, gam, which, had, been, fighting, for, independence, against, the, indonesian, authorities, for, 29, years, has, signed, a, peace, deal, 15, august, 2005, the, perception, that, the, tsunami, was, punishment, for, insufficient, piety, in, this, proudly, muslim, province, is, partly, behind, the, increased, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, religion, post, tsunami, this, has, been, most, obvious, in, the, increased, implementation, of, sharia, law, including, the, introduction, of, the, controversial, wilayatul, hisbah, or, syariah, police, as, homes, are, being, built, and, people, s, basic, needs, are, met, the, people, are, also, looking, to, improve, the, quality, of, education, increase, tourism, and, develop, responsible, sustainable, industry, well, qualified, educators, are, in, high, demand, in, aceh, while, parts, of, the, capital, banda, aceh, were, unscathed, the, areas, closest, to, the, water, especially, the, areas, of, kampung, jawa, and, meuraxa, were, completely, destroyed, most, of, the, rest, of, the, western, coast, of, aceh, was, severely, damaged, many, towns, completely, disappeared, other, towns, on, aceh, s, west, coast, hit, by, the, disaster, included, lhoknga, leupung, lamno, patek, calang, teunom, and, the, island, of, simeulue, affected, or, destroyed, towns, on, the, region, s, north, and, east, coasts, were, pidie, regency, samalanga, and, lhokseumawe, the, area, was, slowly, rebuilt, after, the, disaster, the, government, initially, proposed, the, creation, of, a, two, kilometer, buffer, zone, along, low, lying, coastal, areas, within, which, permanent, construction, was, not, permitted, this, proposal, was, unpopular, among, some, local, inhabitants, and, proved, impractical, in, most, situations, especially, fishing, families, that, are, dependent, on, living, near, to, the, sea, the, indonesian, government, set, up, a, special, agency, for, aceh, reconstruction, the, badan, rehabilitasi, dan, rekonstruksi, brr, headed, by, kuntoro, mangkusubroto, a, former, indonesian, government, minister, this, agency, had, ministry, level, of, authority, and, incorporated, officials, professionals, and, community, leaders, from, all, backgrounds, most, of, the, reconstruction, work, was, performed, by, local, people, using, a, mix, of, traditional, methods, and, partial, prefabricated, structures, with, funding, coming, from, many, international, organizations, and, individuals, governments, and, the, people, themselves, the, government, of, indonesia, estimated, in, their, preliminary, damage, and, losses, assessment, that, damages, amounted, to, us, 4, 5, billion, before, inflation, and, us, 6, 2, billion, including, inflation, three, years, after, the, tsunami, reconstruction, was, still, ongoing, the, world, bank, monitored, funding, for, reconstruction, in, aceh, and, reported, that, us, 7, 7, billion, had, been, earmarked, for, the, reconstruction, whilst, at, june, 2007, us, 5, 8, billion, had, been, allocated, to, specific, reconstruction, projects, of, which, us, 3, 4, billion, had, actually, been, spent, 58, in, 2009, the, government, opened, a, us, 5, 6, million, museum, to, commemorate, the, tsunami, with, photographs, stories, and, a, simulation, of, the, earthquake, that, triggered, the, tsunami, the, 2004, tsunami, helped, trigger, a, peace, agreement, between, the, gam, and, the, indonesian, government, the, mood, in, post, suharto, indonesia, in, the, liberal, democratic, reform, period, as, well, as, changes, in, the, indonesian, military, helped, create, an, environment, more, favorable, to, peace, talks, the, roles, of, newly, elected, president, susilo, bambang, yudhoyono, and, vice, president, jusuf, kalla, were, highly, significant, at, the, same, time, the, gam, leadership, was, undergoing, changes, and, the, indonesian, military, had, inflicted, so, much, damage, on, the, rebel, movement, that, it, had, little, choice, but, to, negotiate, with, the, central,

at, least, eight, baby, elephants, the, area, has, been, suffering, from, deforestation, since, the, 1970s, the, first, wood, pulp, mill, in, aceh, was, built, in, 1982, the, government, of, aceh, intends, a, law, by, which, 1, 2, million, hectares, would, be, opened, for, commercial, use, this, proposal, has, caused, many, protests, within, the, country, aceh, is, governed, not, as, a, regular, province, but, as, a, special, autonomous, province, daerah, istimewa, an, administrative, designation, intended, to, give, the, area, increased, autonomy, from, the, central, government, in, jakarta, this, has, resulted, in, canings, for, crimes, deemed, to, have, violated, sharia, law, such, as, gambling, drinking, skipping, friday, prayers, and, most, notably, homosexuality, regional, elections, have, been, held, in, aceh, in, recent, years, for, senior, positions, at, the, provincial, regency, kabupaten, and, district, kecamatan, levels, in, the, 2006, elections, irwandi, yusuf, was, elected, as, the, provincial, governor, for, 2007, 2012, and, in, elections, in, april, 2012, zaini, abdullah, was, elected, as, governor, for, 2012, 2017, beginning, with, the, promulgation, of, law, 44, 1999, aceh, s, governor, began, to, issue, limited, sharia, based, regulations, for, example, requiring, female, government, employees, to, wear, islamic, dress, these, regulations, were, not, enforced, by, the, provincial, government, but, as, early, as, april, 1999, reports, emerged, that, groups, of, men, in, aceh, were, engaging, in, vigilante, violence, in, an, effort, to, impose, sharia, for, example, by, conducting, jilbab, raids, subjecting, women, who, were, not, wearing, islamic, headscarves, to, verbal, abuse, cutting, their, hair, or, clothes, and, committing, other, acts, of, violence, against, them, the, frequency, of, these, and, other, attacks, on, individuals, considered, to, be, violating, sharia, principles, appeared, to, increase, following, the, enactment, of, law, 44, 1999, and, the, governor, s, sharia, regulations, in, 2014, a, group, of, scholars, who, call, themselves, tadzkiiratul, ummah, started, to, paint, the, pants, of, men, and, women, as, a, call, for, heavier, islamic, law, enforcement, in, the, area, upon, the, enactment, of, the, special, autonomy, law, in, 2001, aceh, s, provincial, legislature, enacted, a, series, of, qanuns, local, laws, governing, the, implementation, of, sharia, five, qanuns, enacted, between, 2002, and, 2004, contained, criminal, penalties, for, violations, of, sharia, qanun, 11, 2002, on, belief, ritual, and, promoting, islam, which, contains, the, islamic, attire, requirement, qanun, 12, 2003, prohibiting, the, consumption, and, sale, of, alcohol, qanun, 13, 2003, prohibiting,

aceh, responsibility, for, enforcement, of, the, qanuns, rests, both, with, the, national, police, and, with, a, special, sharia, police, force, unique, to, aceh, known, as, the, wilayatul, hisbah, sharia, authority, all, of, the, qanuns, provide, for, penalties, including, fines, imprisonment, and, caning, the, latter, a, punishment, unknown, in, most, parts, of, indonesia, between, mid, 2005, and, early, 2007, at, least, 135, people, were, caned, in, aceh, for, transgressing, the, qanuns, in, april, 2016, a, 60, year, old, non, muslim, woman, was, sentenced, to, 30, lashes, for, selling, alcohol, drinks, the, controversy, is, that, qanun, is, not, allowed, for, non, muslim, person, and, national, law, should, be, used, instead, as, in, other, parts, of, indonesia, in, april, 2009, partai, aceh, won, control, of, the, local, parliament, in, aceh, s, first, post, war, legislative, elections, in, september, 2009, one, month, before, the, new, legislators, were, to, take, office, the, outgoing, parliament, unanimously, endorsed, two, new, qanuns, to, expand, the, existing, criminal, sharia, framework, in, aceh, however, the, then, proposed, bylaws, was, met, with, widespread, condemnations, from, all, of, indonesia, and, then, governor, irwandi, yusuf, refused, to, sign, the, bylaw, thereby, keeping, it, a, law, without, legal, force, and, in, some, views, therefore, still, a, law, draft, rather, than, actual, law, in, march, 2013, the, aceh, government, removed, the, stoning, provision, from, its, own, draft, of, a, new, criminal, code, caning, in, practice, since, the, introduction, of, the, new, laws, there, has, been, a, considerable, increase, in, the, use, of, the, penalties, provided, set, out, in, the, laws, as, an, example, in, august, 2015, six, men, in, bireu, n, regency, were, arrested, and, caned, for, betting, on, the, names, of, passing, buses, and, it, was, reported, that, on, just, one, day, 18, september, 2015, a, total, of, 34, people, were, caned, in, banda, aceh, and, in, the, nearby, regency, of, aceh, besar, two, gay, men, are, to, be, publicly, lashed, 85, times, each, under, sharia, law, after, being, filmed, by,

marital, sex, typically, the, whipping, has, been, done, by, men, in, 2020, with, increased, enforcement, and, more, crimes, being, conducted, by, women, aceh, authorities, say, they, are, trying, to,

the, 2020, census, together, with, the, officially, estimated, population, as, at, mid, 2023, aceh, is, unique, in, indonesia, in, grouping, its, villages, into, mukims, these, are, sometimes, related, to, traditional, indigenous, communities, beginning, in, september, 2023, the, indonesian, government, provided, legal, recognition, to, the, claims, of, some, mukims, over, customary,

by, 7, 7, after, having, minimal, growth, since, the, devastating, tsunami, this, growth, was, primarily, driven, by, the, reconstruction, effort, with, massive, growth, in, the, building, construction, sector, the, ending, of, the, conflict, and, the, reconstruction, program, resulted, in, the, structure, of, the, economy, changing, significantly, since, 2003, service, sectors, played, a, more, dominant, role, whilst, the, share, of, the, oil, and, gas, sectors, continued, to, decline, after, peaking, at, around, 40, in, december, 2005, largely, as, a, result, of, the, dutch, disease, impact, of, sudden, aid, flows, into, the, province, inflation, declined, steadily, and, was, 8, 5, in, june, 2007, close, to, the, national, level, in, indonesia, of, 5, 7, persistent, inflation, means, that, aceh, s, consumer, price, index, cpi, remains, the, highest, in, indonesia, as, a, result, aceh, s, cost, competitiveness, has, declined, as, reflected, in, both, inflation, and, wage, data, although, inflation, has, slowed, down, cpi, has, registered, steady, increases, since, the, tsunami, using, 2002, as, a, base, aceh, s, cpi, increased, to, 185, 6, june, 2007, while, the, national, cpi, increased, to, 148, 2, there, have, been, relatively, large, nominal, wage, increases, in, particular, sectors, such, as, construction, where, on, average, workers, nominal, wages, have, risen, to, almost, rp, 60, 000, per, day, from, rp, 29, 000, pre, tsunami, this, is, also, reflected, in, aceh, s, minimum, regional, wage, umr, or, upah, minimum, regional, which, increased, by, 55, from, rp, 550, 000, pre, tsunami, to, rp, 850, 000, in, 2007, compared, with, an, increase, of, 42, in, neighboring, north, sumatra, from, rp, 537, 000, to, rp, 761, 000, poverty, levels, increased, slightly, in, aceh, in, 2005, after, the, tsunami, but, by, less, than, expected, the, poverty, level, then, fell, in, 2006, to, below, the, pre, tsunami, level, suggesting, that, the, rise, in, tsunami, related, poverty, was, short, lived, and, reconstruction, activities, and, the, end, of, the, conflict, most, probably, facilitated, this, decline, however, poverty, in, aceh, remains, significantly, higher, than, in, the, rest, of, indonesia, a, large, number, of, the, acehnese, remain, vulnerable, to, poverty, reinforcing, the, need, for, further, sustained, efforts, at, development, in, the, post, tsunami, construction, period, the, population, of, aceh, was, not, adequately, documented, during, the, indonesia, 2000, census, because, the, insurgency, complicated, the, process, of, collecting, accurate, information, an, estimated, 170, 000, people, died, in, aceh, in, the, 2004, tsunami, which, further, complicates, the, task, of, careful, demographic,
