its, name, from, dardanus, the, mythical, son, of, zeus, and, electra, the, name, comes, from, the, dardani, in, the, balkans, according, to, papazoglu, the, ancient, greek, name, hell, spontos,

today, it, is, a, major, sea, access, route, for, numerous, countries, including, russia, and, ukraine, control, over, it, has, been, an, objective, of, a, number, of, hostilities, in, modern,

near, the, western, entrance, of, the, strait, and, the, strait, s, asiatic, shore, was, the, focus, of, the, trojan, war, troy, was, able, to, control, the, marine, traffic, entering, this, vital, waterway, the, persian, army, of, xerxes, i, of, persia, and, later, the, macedonian, army, of, alexander, the, great, crossed, the, dardanelles, in, opposite, directions, to, invade, each, other, s, lands, in, 480, bc, and, 334, bc, respectively, herodotus, says, that, circa, 482, bc, xerxes, i, the, son, of, darius, had, two, pontoon, bridges, built, across, the, width, of, the, hellespont, at, abydos, in, order, that, his, huge, army, could, cross, from, persia, into, greece, this, crossing, was, named, by, aeschylus, in, his, tragedy, the, persians, as, the, cause, of, divine, intervention, against, xerxes, according, to, herodotus, vv, 34, both, bridges, were, destroyed, by, a, storm, and, xerxes, had, those, responsible, for, building, the, bridges, beheaded, and, the, strait, itself, whipped, the, histories, of, herodotus, vii, 33, 37, and, vii, 54, 58, give, details, of, building, and, crossing, of, xerxes, pontoon, bridges, xerxes, is, then, said, to, have,

that, this, was, a, highly, presumptuous, way, to, address, the, hellespont, but, in, no, way, atypical, of, xerxes, vii, 35, harpalus, the, engineer, is, said, to, have, eventually, helped, the, invading, armies, to, cross, by, lashing, the, ships, together, with, their, bows, facing, the, current, and, adding, two, additional, anchors, to, each, ship, from, the, perspective, of, ancient, greek, mythology, helle, the, daughter, of, athamas, supposedly, was, drowned, at, the, dardanelles, in, the, legend, of, the, golden, fleece, likewise, the, strait, was, the, scene, of, the, legend, of, hero, and, leander, wherein, the, lovesick, leander, swam, the, strait, nightly, in, order, to, tryst, with, his, beloved, the, priestess, hero, but, was, ultimately, drowned, in, a, storm, the,
