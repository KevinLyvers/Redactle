africa, and, the, largest, flowing, into, the, indian, ocean, from, africa, its, drainage, basin, covers, 1, 390, 000, km, 2, 540, 000, sq, mi, slightly, less, than, half, of, the, nile, s, the, 2, 574, km, 1, 599, mi, river, rises, in, zambia, and, flows, through, eastern, angola, along, the, north, eastern, border, of, namibia, and, the, northern, border, of, botswana, then, along, the, border, between, zambia, and, zimbabwe, to, mozambique, where, it, crosses, the, country, to, empty, into, the, indian, ocean, the, zambezi, s, most, noted, feature, is, victoria, falls, its, other, falls, include, the, chavuma, falls, at, the, border, between, zambia, and, angola, and, ngonye, falls, near, sioma, in, western, zambia, the, two, main, sources, of, hydroelectric, power, on, the, river, are, the, kariba, dam, which, provides, power, to, zambia, and, zimbabwe, and, the, cahora, bassa, dam, in, mozambique, which, provides, power, to, mozambique, and, south, africa, additionally, two, smaller, power, stations, are, along, the, zambezi, river, in, zambia, one, at, victoria, falls, and, the, other, in, zengamina, near, kalene, hill, in, the, ikelenge, district, the, river, rises, in, a, black, marshy, dambo, in, dense, undulating, miombo, woodland, 50, km, 31, mi, north, of, mwinilunga, and, 20, km, 12, mi, south, of, ikelenge, in, the, ikelenge, district, of, north, western, province, zambia, at, about, 1, 524, metres, 5, 000, ft, above, sea, level, the, area, around, the, source, is, a, national, monument, forest, reserve, and, important, bird, area, eastward, of, the, source, the, watershed, between, the, congo, and, zambezi, basins, is, a, well, marked, belt, of, high, ground, running, nearly, east, west, and, falling, abruptly, to, the, north, and, south, this, distinctly, cuts, off, the, basin, of, the, lualaba, the, main, branch, of, the, upper, congo, from, the, zambezi, in, the, neighborhood, of, the, source, the, watershed, is, not, as, clearly, defined, but, the, two, river, systems, do, not, connect, the, region, drained, by, the, zambezi, is, a, vast, broken, edged, plateau, 900, 1, 200, m, high, composed, in, the, remote, interior, of, metamorphic, beds, and, fringed, with, the, igneous, rocks, of, the, victoria, falls, at, chupanga, on, the, lower, zambezi, thin, strata, of, grey, and, yellow, sandstones, with, an, occasional, band, of, limestone, crop, out, on, the, bed, of, the, river, in, the, dry, season, and, these, persist, beyond, tete, where, they, are, associated, with, extensive, seams, of, coal, coal, is, also, found, in, the, district, just, below, victoria, falls, gold, bearing, rocks, occur, in, several, places, the, river, flows, to, the, southwest, into, angola, for, about, 240, km, 150, mi, then, is, joined, by, sizeable, tributaries, such, as, the, luena, and, the, chifumage, flowing, from, highlands, to, the, north, west, it, turns, south, and, develops, a, floodplain, with, extreme, width, variation, between, the, dry, and, rainy, seasons, it, enters, dense, evergreen, cryptosepalum, dry, forest, though, on, its, western, side, western, zambezian, grasslands, also, occur, where, it, re, enters, zambia, it, is, nearly, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, wide, in, the, rainy, season, and, flows, rapidly, with, rapids, ending, in, the, chavuma, falls, where, the, river, flows, through, a, rocky, fissure, the, river, drops, about, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, in, elevation, from, its, source, at, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, to, the, chavuma, falls, at, 1, 100, m, 3, 600, ft, over, a, distance, of, about, 400, km, 250, mi, from, this, point, to, the, victoria, falls, the, level, of, the, basin, is, very, uniform, dropping, only, by, another, 180, m, 590, ft, across, a, distance, of, around, 800, km, 500, mi, the, first, of, its, large, tributaries, to, enter, the, zambezi, is, the, kabompo, river, in, the, north, western, province, of, zambia, the, savanna, through, which, the, river, flows, gives, way, to, a, wide, floodplain, studded, with, borassus, fan, palms, a, little, farther, south, is, the, confluence, with, the, lungwebungu, river, this, is, the, beginning, of, the, barotse, floodplain, the, most, notable, feature, of, the, upper, zambezi, but, this, northern, part, does, not, flood, so, much, and, includes, islands, of, higher, land, in, the, middle, about, 30, km, below, the, confluence, of, the, lungwebungu, the, country, becomes, very, flat, and, the, typical, barotse, floodplain, landscape, unfolds, with, the, flood, reaching, a, width, of, 25, km, in, the, rainy, season, for, more, than, 200, km, downstream, the, annual, flood, cycle, dominates, the, natural, environment, and, human, life, society, and, culture, about, 80, km, further, down, the, luanginga, which, with, its, tributaries, drains, a, large, area, to, the, west, joins, the, zambezi, a, short, distance, higher, up, on, the, east, the, main, stream, is, joined, in, the, rainy, season, by, overflow, of, the, luampa, luena, system, a, short, distance, downstream, of, the, confluence, with, the, luanginga, is, lealui, one, of, the, capitals, of, the, lozi, people, who, populate, the, zambian, region, of, barotseland, in, the, western, province, the, chief, of, the, lozi, maintains, one, of, his, two, compounds, at, lealui, the, other, is, at, limulunga, which, is, on, high, ground, and, serves, as, the, capital, during, the, rainy, season, the, annual, move, from, lealui, to, limulunga, is, a, major, event, celebrated, as, one, of, zambia, s, best, known, festivals, the, kuomboka, after, lealui, the, river, turns, south, southeast, from, the, east, it, continues, to, receive, numerous, small, streams, but, on, the, west, it, is, without, major, tributaries, for, 240, km, before, this, the, ngonye, falls, and, subsequent, rapids, interrupt, navigation, south, of, ngonye, falls, the, river, briefly, borders, namibia, s, caprivi, strip, below, the, junction, of, the, cuando, river, and, the, zambezi, the, river, bends, almost, due, east, here, the, river, is, broad, and, shallow, and, flows, slowly, but, as, it, flows, eastward, towards, the, border, of, the, great, central, plateau, of, africa, it, reaches, a, chasm, into, which, the, victoria, falls, plunge, the, victoria, falls, are, considered, the, boundary, between, the, upper, and, middle, zambezi, below, them, the, river, continues, to, flow, due, east, for, about, 200, km, 120, mi, cutting, through, perpendicular, walls, of, basalt, 20, to, 60, m, 66, to, 197, ft, apart, in, hills, 200, to, 250, m, 660, to, 820, ft, high, the, river, flows, swiftly, through, the, batoka, gorge, the, current, being, continually, interrupted, by, reefs, it, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, spectacular, whitewater, trips, a, tremendous, challenge, for, kayakers, and, rafters, alike, beyond, the, gorge, are, a, succession, of, rapids, that, end, 240, km, 150, mi, below, victoria, falls, over, this, distance, the, river, drops, 250, m, 820, ft, at, this, point, the, river, enters, lake, kariba, created, in, 1959, following, the, completion, of, the, kariba, dam, the, lake, is, one, of, the, largest, man, made, lakes, in, the, world, and, the, hydroelectric, power, generating, facilities, at, the, dam, provide, electricity, to, much, of, zambia, and, zimbabwe, the, luangwa, and, kafue, rivers, are, the, two, largest, left, hand, tributaries, of, the, zambezi, the, kafue, joins, the, main, river, in, a, quiet, deep, stream, about, 180, m, 590, ft, wide, from, this, point, the, northward, bend, of, the, zambezi, is, checked, and, the, stream, continues, due, east, at, the, confluence, of, the, luangwa, 15, 37, s, it, enters, mozambique, the, middle, zambezi, ends, where, the, river, enters, lake, cahora, bassa, formerly, the, site, of, dangerous, rapids, known, as, kebrabassa, the, lake, was, created, in, 1974, by, the, construction, of, the, cahora, bassa, dam, the, lower, zambezi, s, 650, kilometres, 400, mi, from, cahora, bassa, to, the, indian, ocean, is, navigable, although, the, river, is, shallow, in, many, places, during, the, dry, season, this, shallowness, arises, as, the, river, enters, a, broad, valley, and, spreads, out, over, a, large, area, only, at, one, point, the, lupata, gorge, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, from, its, mouth, is, the, river, confined, between, high, hills, here, it, is, scarcely, 200, metres, 660, ft, wide, elsewhere, it, is, from, 5, to, 8, kilometres, 3, to, 5, mi, wide, flowing, gently, in, many, streams, the, river, bed, is, sandy, and, the, banks, are, low, and, reed, fringed, at, places, however, and, especially, in, the, rainy, season, the, streams, unite, into, one, broad, fast, flowing, river, about, 160, kilometres, 99, mi, from, the, sea, the, zambezi, receives, the, drainage, of, lake, malawi, through, the, shire, river, on, approaching, the, indian, ocean, the, river, splits, up, into, a, delta, each, of, the, primary, distributaries, kongone, luabo, and, timbwe, is, obstructed, by, a, sand, bar, a, more, northerly, branch, called, the, chinde, mouth, has, a, minimum, depth, at, low, water, of, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, at, the, entrance, and, 4, metres, 13, ft, further, in, and, is, the, branch, used, for, navigation, about, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, further, north, is, a, river, called, the, quelimane, after, the, town, at, its, mouth, this, stream, which, is, silting, up, receives, the, overflow, of, the, zambezi, in, the, rainy, season, average, minimum, and, maximum, discharge, of, the, zambezi, river, at, marromeu, lower, zambezi, period, from, 1998, to, 2022, the, delta, of, the, zambezi, is, today, about, half, as, broad, as, it, was, before, the, construction, of, the, kariba, and, cahora, bassa, dams, controlled, the, seasonal, variations, in, the, flow, rate, of, the, river, before, the, dams, were, built, seasonal, flooding, of, the, zambezi, had, quite, a, different, impact, on, the, ecosystems, of, the, delta, from, today, as, it, brought, nutrient, rich, fresh, water, down, to, the, indian, ocean, coastal, wetlands, the, lower, zambezi, experienced, a, small, flood, surge, early, in, the, dry, season, as, rain, in, the, gwembe, catchment, and, north, eastern, zimbabwe, rushed, through, while, rain, in, the, upper, zambezi, kafue, and, lake, malawi, basins, and, luangwa, to, a, lesser, extent, is, held, back, by, swamps, and, floodplains, the, discharges, of, these, systems, contribute, to, a, much, larger, flood, in, march, or, april, with, a, mean, monthly, maximum, for, april, of, 6, 700, m, 3, 240, 000, cu, ft, per, second, at, the, delta, the, record, flood, was, more, than, three, times, as, big, 22, 500, m, 3, 790, 000, cu, ft, per, second, being, recorded, in, 1958, by, contrast, the, discharge, at, the, end, of, the, dry, season, averaged, just, 500, m, 3, 18, 000, cu, ft, per, second, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, building, of, dams, changed, that, pattern, completely, downstream, the, mean, monthly, minimum, maximum, was, 500, to, 6, 000, m, 3, 18, 000, to, 212, 000, cu, ft, per, second, now, it, is, 1, 000, to, 3, 900, m, 3, 35, 000, to, 138, 000, cu, ft, per, second, medium, level, floods, especially, of, the, kind, to, which, the, ecology, of, the, lower, zambezi, was, adapted, happen, less, often, and, have, a, shorter, duration, as, with, the, itezhi, tezhi, dam, s, deleterious, effects, on, the, kafue, flats, this, has, these, effects, the, zambezi, delta, has, extensive, seasonally, and, permanently, flooded, grasslands, savannas, and, swamp, forests, together, with, the, floodplains, of, the, buzi, pungwe, and, save, rivers, the, zambezi, s, floodplains, make, up, the, world, wildlife, fund, s, zambezian, coastal, flooded, savanna, ecoregion, in, mozambique, the, flooded, savannas, lie, close, to, the, indian, ocean, coast, mangroves, fringe, the, delta, s, shoreline, although, the, dams, have, stemmed, some, of, the, annual, flooding, of, the, lower, zambezi, and, caused, the, area, of, floodplain, to, be, greatly, reduced, they, have, not, removed, flooding, completely, they, cannot, control, extreme, floods, and, they, have, only, made, medium, level, floods, less, frequent, when, heavy, rain, in, the, lower, zambezi, combines, with, significant, runoff, upstream, massive, floods, still, happen, and, the, wetlands, are, still, an, important, habitat, the, shrinking, of, the, wetlands, though, resulted, in, uncontrolled, hunting, of, animals, such, as, buffalo, and, waterbuck, during, the, mozambican, civil, war, although, the, region, has, had, a, reduction, in, the, populations, of, the, large, mammals, it, is, still, home, to, some, including, the, reedbuck, and, migrating, eland, carnivores, found, here, include, lion, panthera, leo, leopard, panthera, pardus, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, and, side, striped, jackal, canis, adustus, the, floodplains, are, a, haven, for, migratory, waterbirds, including, pintails, garganey, african, openbill, anastomus, lamelligerus, saddle, billed, stork, ephippiorhynchus, senegalensis, wattled, crane, bugeranus, carunculatus, and, great, white, pelican, pelecanus, onocrotalus, reptiles, include, nile, crocodile, crocodylus, niloticus, nile, monitor, lizard, varanus, niloticus, african, rock, python, python, sebae, the, endemic, pungwe, worm, snake, leptotyphlops, pungwensis, and, three, other, snakes, that,

many, animals, hippopotamuses, are, abundant, along, most, of, the, calm, stretches, of, the, river, as, well, as, nile, crocodiles, monitor, lizards, are, found, in, many, places, birds, are, abundant, with, species, including, heron, pelican, egret, lesser, flamingo, and, african, fish, eagle, present, in, large, numbers, riverine, woodland, also, supports, many, large, animals, such, as, buffalo, zebras, giraffes, and, elephants, the, zambezi, also, supports, several, hundred, species, of, fish, some, of, which, are, endemic, to, the, river, important, species, include, cichlids, which, are, fished, heavily, for, food, as, well, as, catfish, tigerfish, yellowfish, and, other, large, species, the, bull, shark, is, sometimes, known, as, the, zambezi, shark, after, the, river, not, to, be, mistaken, with, glyphis, freshwater, shark, genus, that, inhabit, the, river, as, well, upper, zambezi, 507, 200, km, 2, discharges, 1044, m, 3, s, at, victoria, falls, comprising,

occasionally, overflows, to, any, extent, into, the, zambezi, because, of, the, rainfall, distribution, northern, tributaries, contribute, much, more, water, than, southern, ones, for, example, the, northern, highlands, catchment, of, the, upper, zambezi, contributes, 25, kafue, 8, luangwa, and, shire, rivers, 16, each, total, 65, of, zambezi, discharge, the, large, cuando, basin, in, the, south, west, though, contributes, only, about, 2, m, 3, s, because, most, is, lost, through, evaporation, in, its, swamp, systems, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, were, particularly, wet, decades, in, the, basin, since, 1975, it, has, been, drier, the, average, discharge, being, only, 70, of, that, for, the, years, 1930, to, 1958, up, to, the, late, pliocene, or, pleistocene, more, than, two, million, years, ago, the, upper, zambezi, flowed, south, through, what, is, now, the, makgadikgadi, pan, to, the, limpopo, river, the, change, of, the, river, course, is, the, result, of, epeirogenic, movements, that, lifted, up, the, surface, at, the, present, day, water, divide, between, both, rivers, meanwhile, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, east, a, western, tributary, of, the, shire, river, in, the, east, african, rift, s, southern, extension, through, malawi, eroded, a, deep, valley, on, its, western, escarpment, at, a, slow, rate, the, middle, zambezi, started, cutting, back, the, bed, of, its, river, towards, the, west, aided, by, grabens, rift, valleys, forming, along, its, course, in, an, east, west, axis, as, it, did, so, it, captured, several, south, flowing, rivers, such, as, the, luangwa, and, kafue, eventually, the, large, lake, trapped, at, makgadikgadi, or, a, tributary, of, it, was, captured, by, the, middle, zambezi, cutting, back, towards, it, and, emptied, eastwards, the, upper, zambezi, was, captured, as, well, the, middle, zambezi, was, about, 300, m, 980, ft, lower, than, the, upper, zambezi, and, a, high, waterfall, formed, at, the, edge, of, the, basalt, plateau, across, which, the, upper, river, flows, this, was, the, first, victoria, falls, somewhere, down, the, batoka, gorge, near, where, lake, kariba, is, now, the, first, european, to, come, across, the, zambezi, river, was, vasco, da, gama, in, january, 1498, who, anchored, at, what, he, called, rio, dos, bons, sinais, river, of, good, omens, now, the, quelimane, or, qu, qua, a, small, river, on, the, northern, end, of, the, delta, which, at, that, time, was, connected, by, navigable, channels, to, the, zambezi, river, proper, the, connection, silted, up, by, the, 1830s, in, a, few, of, the, oldest, maps, the, entire, river, is, denoted, as, such, by, the, 16th, century, a, new, name, emerged, the, cuama, river, sometimes, quama, or, zuama, cuama, was, the, local, name, given, by, the, dwellers, of, the, swahili, coast, for, an, outpost, located, on, one, of, the, southerly, islands, of, the, delta, near, the, luabo, channel, most, old, nautical, maps, denote, the, luabo, entry, as, cuama, the, entire, delta, as, the, rivers, of, cuama, and, the, zambezi, proper, as, the, cuama, river, in, 1552, portuguese, chronicler, jo, o, de, barros, noted, that, the, same, cuama, river, was, called, zembere, by, the, inland, people, of, monomatapa, the, portuguese, dominican, friar, jo, o, dos, santos, visiting, monomatapa, in, 1597, reported, it, as, zambeze, bantu, languages, frequently, shifts, between, z, and, r, and, inquired, into, the, origins, of, the, name, he, was, told, it, was, named, after, a, people, the, river, cuama, is, by, them, called, zambeze, the, head, whereof, is, so, farre, within, land, that, none, of, them, know, it, but, by, tradition, of, their, progenitors, say, it, comes, from, a, lake, in, the, midst, of, the, continent, which, yeelds, also, other, great, rivers, divers, ways, visiting, the, sea, they, call, it, zambeze, of, a, nation, of, cafres, dwelling, neere, that, lake, which, are, so, called, j, santos, ethiopia, oriental, 1609, thus, the, term, zambezi, is, after, a, people, who, live, by, a, great, lake, to, the, north, the, most, likely, candidates, are, the, m, biza, or, bisa, people, in, older, texts, given, as, muisa, movisa, abisa, ambios, and, other, variations, a, bantu, people, who, live, in, what, is, now, central, eastern, zambia, between, the, zambezi, river, and, lake, bangweolo, at, the, time, before, the, lunda, invasion, the, bisa, would, have, likely, stretched, further, north, possibly, to, lake, tanganyika, the, bisa, had, a, reputation, as, great, cloth, traders, throughout, the, region, in, a, curious, note, goese, born, portuguese, trader, manuel, caetano, pereira, who, traveled, to, the, bisa, homelands, in, 1796, was, surprised, to, be, shown, a, second, separate, river, referred, to, as, the, zambezi, this, other, zambezi, that, puzzled, pereira, is, most, likely, what, modern, sources, spell, the, chambeshi, river, in, northern, zambia, the, monomatapa, notion, reported, by, santos, that, the, zambezi, was, sourced, from, a, great, internal, lake, might, be, a, reference, to, one, of, the, african, great, lakes, one, of, the, names, reported, by, early, explorers, for, lake, malawi, was, lake, zambre, probably, a, corruption, of, zambezi, possibly, because, lake, malawi, is, connected, to, the, lower, zambezi, via, the, shire, river, the, monomatapa, story, resonated, with, the, old, european, notion, drawn, from, classical, antiquity, that, all, the, great, african, rivers, the, nile, the, senegal, the, congo, and, the, zambezi, were, all, sourced, from, the, same, great, internal, lake, the, portuguese, were, also, told, that, the, mozambican, espirito, santo, river, actually, an, estuary, formed, by, the, umbeluzi, matola, and, tembe, rivers, was, sourced, from, a, lake, hence, its, outlet, became, known, as, delagoa, bay, as, a, result, several, old, maps, depict, the, zambezi, and, the, espirito, santo, rivers, converging, deep, in, the, interior, at, the, same, lake, however, the, bisa, derived, etymology, is, not, without, dispute, in, 1845, w, d, cooley, examining, pereira, s, notes, concluded, the, term, zambezi, derives, not, from, the, bisa, people, but, rather, from, the, bantu, term, mbege, mbeze, fish, and, consequently, it, probably, means, merely, river, of, fish, david, livingstone, who, reached, the, upper, zambezi, in, 1853, refers, to, it, as, zambesi, but, also, makes, note, of, the, local, name, leeambye, used, by, the, lozi, people, which, he, says, means, large, river, or, river, par, excellence, livingstone, records, other, names, for, the, zambezi, luambeji, luambesi, ambezi, ojimbesi, and, zambesi, applied, by, different, peoples, along, its, course, and, asserts, they, all, possess, a,
