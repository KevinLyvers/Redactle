situated, approximately, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, southwest, of, tassili, n, ajjer, the, archaeological, site, has, been, designated, a, national, park, a, biosphere, reserve, cypresses, and, was, inducted, into, the, unesco, world, heritage, site, list, as, tassili, n, ajjer, national, park, the, plateau, is, of, great, geological, and, aesthetic, interest, its, panorama, of, geological, formations, of, rock, forests, composed, of, eroded, sandstone, resembles, a, lunar, landscape, and, hosts, a, range, of, rock, art, styles, the, range, is, composed, largely, of, sandstone, the, sandstone, is, stained, by, a, thin, outer, layer, of, deposited, metallic, oxides, that, color, the, rock, formations, variously, from, near, black, to, dull, red, erosion, in, the, area, has, resulted, in, nearly, 300, natural, rock, arches, being, formed, in, the, south, east, along, with, deep, gorges, and, permanent, water, pools, in, the, north, due, to, the, higher, elevation, of, the, area, coupled, with, the, water, retentive, properties, of, the, sandstone, the, vegetation, here, is, somewhat, more, lush, and, verdant, than, in, the, lower, regions, of, desert, in, turn, this, creates, an, attractive, habitat, for, numerous, animal, species, from, the, smallest, invertebrates, up, the, food, chain, to, mammals, the, park, features, an, open, woodland, primarily, consisting, of, the, endangered, and, endemic, cupressus, dupreziana, saharan, cypress, and, myrtus, nivellei, saharan, myrtle, in, its, higher, elevation, eastern, half, the, tassili, cypress, is, one, of, the, longest, living, trees, and, organisms, on, earth, after, the, bristlecone, pines, genus, pinus, of, the, western, us, the, ecology, of, the, tassili, n, ajjer, is, more, fully, described, in, the, article, west, saharan, montane, xeric, woodlands, the, ecoregion, to, which, this, area, belongs, the, literal, english, translation, of, tassili, n, ajjer, is, plateau, of, rivers, fragmented, populations, of, west, african, crocodile, crocodylus, suchus, had, survived, in, tassili, n, ajjer, until, the, twentieth, century, today, the, species, is, primarily, found, in, more, tropical, and, sub, saharan, regions, of, western, and, central, africa, from, senegal, to, chad, the, aoudad, or, barbary, sheep, ammotragus, lervia, is, the, only, extant, species, of, animal, depicted, in, the, area, s, ancient, rock, artwork, algerian, rock, art, has, been, subject, to, european, study, since, 1863, with, surveys, conducted, by, a, pomel, 1893, 1898, st, phane, gsell, 1901, 1927, g, b, m, flamand, 1892, 1921, leo, frobenius, and, hugo, obermaier, 1925, henri, breuil, 1931, 1957, l, joleaud, 1918, 1938, and, raymond, vaufrey, 1935, 1955, tassili, was, already, well, known, by, the, early, 20th, century, but, westerners, were, broadly, introduced, to, it, through, a, series, of, sketches, made, by, french, legionnaires, particularly, lieutenant, charles, brenans, in, the, 1930s, he, brought, with, him, french, archaeologist, henri, lhote, who, would, later, return, during, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1962, and, 1970, lhote, s, expeditions, have, been, heavily, criticized, with, his, team, accused, of, faking, images, and, of, damaging, paintings, in, brightening, them, for, tracing, and, photography, which, resulted, in, reducing, the, original, colors, beyond, repair, the, site, of, tassili, was, primarily, occupied, during, the, neolithic, period, by, transhumant, pastoralist, groups, whose, lifestyle, benefited, both, humans, and, livestock, the, local, geography, elevation, and, natural, resources, were, optimal, conditions, for, dry, season, camping, of, small, groups, the, wadis, within, the, mountain, range, functioned, as, corridors, between, the, rocky, highlands, and, the, sandy, lowlands, the, highlands, have, archaeological, evidence, of, occupation, dating, from, 5500, to, 1500, bce, while, the, lowlands, have, stone, tumuli, and, hearths, dating, between, 6000, and, 4000, bce, the, lowland, locations, appear, to, have, been, used, as, living, sites, specifically, during, the, rainy, season, there, are, numerous, rock, shelters, within, the, sandstone, forests, strewn, with, neolithic, artifacts, including, ceramic, pots, and, potsherds, lithic, arrowheads, bowls, and, grinders, beads, and, jewelry, the, transition, to, pastoralism, following, the, african, humid, period, during, the, early, holocene, is, reflected, in, tassili, n, ajjer, s, archaeological, material, record, rock, art, and, zooarchaeology, further, the, occupation, of, tassili, is, part, of, a, larger, movement, and, climate, shift, within, the, central, sahara, paleoclimatic, and, paleoenvironment, studies, started, in, the, central, sahara, around, 14, 000, bp, and, then, proceeded, by, an, arid, period, that, resulted, in, narrow, ecological, niches, however, the, climate, was, not, consistent, and, the, sahara, was, split, between, the, arid, lowlands, and, the, humid, highlands, archaeological, excavations, confirm, that, human, occupation, in, the, form, of, hunter, gather, groups, occurred, between, 10, 000, and, 7500, bp, following, 7500, bp, humans, began, to, organize, into, pastoral, groups, in, response, to, the, increasingly, unpredictable, climate, there, was, a, dry, period, from, 7900, and, 7200, bp, in, tassili, that, preceded, the, appearance, of, the, first, pastoral, groups, which, is, consistent, with, other, parts, of, the, saharan, sahelian, belt, the, pre, pastoral, pottery, excavated, from, tassili, dates, around, 9, 000, 8, 500, bp, while, the, pastoral, pottery, is, from, 7100, 6000, bp, the, rock, art, at, tassili, is, used, in, conjunction, with, other, sites, including, dhar, tichitt, in, mauritania, to, study, the, development, of, animal, husbandry, and, trans, saharan, travel, in, north, africa, cattle, were, herded, across, vast, areas, as, early, as, 3000, 2000, bce, reflecting, the, origins, and, spread, of, pastoralism, in, the, area, this, was, followed, by, horses, before, 1000, bce, and, then, the, camel, in, the, next, millennium, the, arrival, of, camels, reflects, the, increased, development, of, trans, saharan, trade, as, camels, were, primarily, used, as, transport, in, trade, caravans, the, rock, formation, is, an, archaeological, site, noted, for, its, numerous, prehistoric, parietal, works, of, rock, art, first, reported, in, 1910, that, date, to, the, early, neolithic, era, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, during, which, the, sahara, was, a, habitable, savanna, rather, than, the, current, desert, although, sources, vary, considerably, the, earliest, pieces, of, art, are, presumed, to, be, 12, 000, years, old, the, vast, majority, date, to, the, ninth, and, tenth, millennia, bp, or, younger, according, to, osl, dating, of, associated, sediments, the, art, was, dated, by, gathering, small, fragments, of, the, painted, panels, that, had, dried, out, and, flaked, off, before, being, buried, among, the, 15, 000, engravings, so, far, identified, the, subjects, depicted, are, large, wild, animals, including, antelopes, and, crocodiles, cattle, herds, and, humans, who, engage, in, activities, such, as, hunting, and, dancing, these, paintings, are, some, of, the, earliest, by, central, saharan, artists, and, occur, in, the, largest, concentration, at, tassili, although, algeria, is, relatively, close, to, the, iberian, peninsula, the, rock, art, of, tassili, n, ajjer, evolved, separately, from, that, of, the, european, tradition, according, to, unesco, the, exceptional, density, of, paintings, and, engravings, have, made, tassili, world, famous, similar, to, other, saharan, sites, with, rock, art, tassili, can, be, separated, into, five, distinct, traditions, archaic, 10, 000, to, 7500, bce, round, head, 7550, to, 5050, bce, bovidian, or, pastoral, 4500, to, 4000, bce, horse, from, 2000, bce, and, 50, ce, and, camel, 1000, bce, and, onward, the, archaic, period, consists, primarily, of, wild, animals, that, lived, in, the, sahara, during, the, early, holocene, these, works, are, attributed, to, hunter, gather, peoples, consisting, of, only, etchings, images, are, primarily, of, larger, animals, depicted, in, a, naturalistic, manner, with, the, occasional, geometric, pattern, and, the, human, figure, usually, the, humans, and, animals, are, depicted, within, the, context, of, a, hunting, scene, the, round, head, period, is, associated, with, specific, stylistic, choices, depicting, humanoid, forms, and, is, well, separated, from, the, archaic, tradition, even, though, hunter, gatherers, were, the, artists, for, both, the, art, consists, mainly, of, paintings, with, some, of, the, oldest, and, largest, exposed, rock, paintings, in, africa, one, human, figure, stands, over, five, meters, and, another, at, three, and, a, half, meters, the, unique, depiction, of, floating, figures, with, round, featureless, heads, and, formless, bodies, appear, to, be, floating, on, the, rock, surface, hence, the, round, head, label, the, occurrence, of, these, paintings, and, motifs, are, concentrated, in, specific, locations, on, the, plateau, implying, that, these, sites, were, the, center, of, ritual, rites, and, ceremonies, most, animals, shown, are, mouflon, and, antelope, usually, in, static, positions, that, do, not, appear, to, be, part, of, a, hunting, scene, the, bovidian, pastoral, period, correlates, with, the, arrival, of, domesticated, cattle, into, the, sahara, and, the, gradual, shift, to, mobile, pastoralism, there, is, a, notable, and, visual, difference, between, the, pastoral, period, and, the, earlier, two, periods, coinciding, with, the, aridification, of, the, sahara, there, is, increased, stylistic, variation, implying, the, movement, of, different, cultural, groups, within, the, area, domesticated, animals, such, as, cattle, sheep, goats, and, dogs, are, depicted, paralleling, the, zooarchaeological, record, of, the, area, the, scenes, reference, diversified, communities, of, herders, hunters, with, bows, as, well, as, women, and, children, and, imply, a, growing, stratification, of, society, based, on, property, the, following, horse, traditions, correspond, with, the, complete, desertification, of, the, sahara, and, the, requirement, for, new, travel, methods, the, arrival, of, horses, horse, drawn, chariots, and, riders, are, depicted, often, in, mid, gallop, and, is, associated, more, with, hunting, than, warfare, inscriptions, of, libyan, berber, script, used, by, ancestral, berber, peoples, appear, next, to, the, images, however, the, text, is, completely, indecipherable, the, last, period, is, defined, by, the, appearance, of, camels, which, replaced, donkeys, and, cattle, as, the, main, mode, of, transportation, across, the, sahara, the, arrival, of, camels, coincides, with, the, development, of, long, distance, trade, routes, used, by, caravans, to, transport, salt, goods, and, enslaved, people, across, the, sahara, men, both, mounted, and, unmounted, with, shields, spears, and, swords, are, present, animals, including, cows, and, goats, are, included, but, wild, animals, were, crudely, rendered, although, these, periods, are, successive, the, timeframes, are, flexible, and, are, consistently, being, reconstructed, by, archaeologists, as, technology, and, interpretation, develop, the, art, had, been, dated, by, archaeologists, who, gathered, fallen, fragments, and, debris, from, the, rock, face, a, notable, piece, common, in, academic, writing, is, the, running, horned, woman, also, known, as, the, horned, goddess, from, the, round, head, period, the, image, depicts, a, female, figure, with, horns, in, midstride, dots, adorn, her, torso, and, limbs, and, she, is, dressed, in, fringed, armbands, a, skirt, leg, bands, and, anklets, according, to, arisika, razak, tassili, s, horned, goddess, is, an, early, example, of, the, african, sacred, feminine, her, femininity, fertility, and, connection, to, nature, are, emphasized, while, the, neolithic, artist, superimposes, the, figure, onto, smaller, older, figures, the, use, of, bull, horns, is, a, common, theme, in, later, round, head, paintings, which, reflects, the, steady, integration, of, domesticated, cattle, into, saharan, daily, life, cattle, imagery, specifically, that, of, bulls, became, a, central, theme, in, not, only, at, tassili, but, at, other, nearby, sites, in, libya, in, 1989, the, psychedelics, researcher, giorgio, samorini, proposed, the, theory, that, the, fungoid, like, paintings, in, the, caves, of, tassili, are, proof, of, the, relationship, between, humans, and, psychedelics, in, the, ancient, populations, of, the, sahara, when, it, was, still, a, verdant, land, one, of, the, most, important, scenes, is, to, be, found, in, the, tin, tazarift, rock, art, site, at, tassili, in, which, we, find, a, series, of, masked, figures, in, line, and, hieratically, dressed, or, dressed, as, dancers, surrounded, by, long, and, lively, festoons, of, geometrical, designs, of, different, kinds, each, dancer, holds, a, mushroom, like, object, in, the, right, hand, and, even, more, surprising, two, parallel, lines, come, out, of, this, object, to, reach, the, central, part, of, the, head, of, the, dancer, the, area, of, the, roots, of, the, two, horns, this, double, line, could, signify, an, indirect, association, or, non, material, fluid, passing, from, the, object, held, in, the, right, hand, and, the, mind, this, interpretation, would, coincide, with, the, mushroom, interpretation, if, we, bear, in, mind, the, universal, mental, value, induced, by, hallucinogenic, mushrooms, and, vegetals, which, is, often, of, a, mystical, and, spiritual, nature, dobkin, de, rios, 1984, 194, it, would, seem, that, these, lines, in, themselves, an, ideogram, that, represents, something, non, material, in, ancient, art, represent, the, effect, that, the, mushroom, has, on, the, human, mind, in, a, shelter, in, tin, abouteka, in, tassili, there, is, a, motif, appearing, at, least, twice, that, associates, mushrooms, and, fish, a, unique, association, of, symbols, among, ethno, mycological, cultures, two, mushrooms, are, depicted, opposite, each, other, in, a, perpendicular, position, about, the, fish, motif, and, near, the, tail, not, far, from, here, above, we, find, other, fish, which, are, similar, to, the, aforementioned, but, without, the, side, mushrooms, this, theory, was, reused, by, terence, mckenna, in, his, 1992, book, food, of, the, gods, hypothesizing, that, the, neolithic, culture, that, inhabited, the, site, used, psilocybin, mushrooms, as, part, of, its, religious, ritual, life, citing, rock, paintings, showing, persons, holding, mushroom, like, objects, in, their, hands, as, well, as, mushrooms, growing, from, their, bodies, for, henri, lhote, who, discovered, the, tassili, caves, in, the, late, 1950s, these, were, obviously, secret, sanctuaries, the, painting, that, best, supports, the, mushroom, hypothesis, is, the, tassili, mushroom, figure, matalem, amazar, where, the, body, of, the, represented, shaman, is, covered, with, mushrooms, according, to, earl, lee, in, his, book, from, the, bodies, of, the, gods, psychoactive, plants, and, the, cults, of, the, dead, 2012, this, imagery, refers, to, an, ancient, episode, where, a, mushroom, shaman, was, buried, while, fully, clothed, and, when, unearthed, sometime, later, tiny, mushrooms, would, be, growing, on, the, clothes, earl, lee, considered, the, mushroom, paintings, at, tassili, fairly, realistic, according, to, brian, akers, writer, for, the, mushroom, journal, the, fungoid, rock, art, in, tassili, does, not, resemble, the, representations, of, the, psilocybe, hispanica, in, the, selva, pascuala, caves, 2015, and, he, doesn, t, consider, it, realistic, the, tin, taghirt, site, is, located, in, the, tassili, n, ajjer, between, the, cities, of, dider, and, iherir
