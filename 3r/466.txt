which, helped, dramatically, increase, the, literacy, rate, in, addition, to, a, nationalization, program, of, industry, and, land, the, new, regime, s, foreign, policy, placed, an, emphasis, on, somalia, s, traditional, and, religious, links, with, the, arab, world, eventually, joining, the, arab, league, in, february, 1974, that, same, year, barre, also, served, as, chairman, of, the, organisation, of, african, unity, oau, the, predecessor, of, the, african, union, au, in, july, 1976, barre, s, src, disbanded, itself, and, established, in, its, place, the, somali, revolutionary, socialist, party, srsp, a, one, party, government, based, on, scientific, socialism, and, islamic, tenets, the, srsp, was, an, attempt, to, reconcile, the, official, state, ideology, with, the, official, state, religion, by, adapting, marxist, precepts, to, local, circumstances, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, muslim, principles, of, social, progress, equality, and, justice, which, the, government, argued, formed, the, core, of, scientific, socialism, and, its, own, accent, on, self, sufficiency, public, participation, and, popular, control, as, well, as, direct, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, while, the, srsp, encouraged, private, investment, on, a, limited, scale, the, administration, s, overall, direction, was, essentially, communist, in, july, 1977, the, ogaden, war, broke, out, after, barre, s, government, used, a, plea, for, national, unity, to, justify, an, aggressive, incorporation, of, the, predominantly, somali, inhabited, ogaden, region, of, ethiopia, into, a, pan, somali, greater, somalia, along, with, the, rich, agricultural, lands, of, south, eastern, ethiopia, infrastructure, and, strategically, important, areas, as, far, north, as, djibouti, in, the, first, week, of, the, conflict, somali, armed, forces, took, southern, and, central, ogaden, and, for, most, of, the, war, the, somali, army, scored, continuous, victories, on, the, ethiopian, army, and, followed, them, as, far, as, sidamo, by, september, 1977, somalia, controlled, 90, of, the, ogaden, and, captured, strategic, cities, such, as, jijiga, and, put, heavy, pressure, on, dire, dawa, threatening, the, train, route, from, the, latter, city, to, djibouti, after, the, siege, of, harar, a, massive, unprecedented, soviet, intervention, consisting, of, 20, 000, cuban, forces, and, several, thousand, soviet, experts, came, to, the, aid, of, ethiopia, s, communist, derg, regime, by, 1978, the, somali, troops, were, ultimately, pushed, out, of, the, ogaden, this, shift, in, support, by, the, soviet, union, motivated, the, barre, government, to, seek, allies, elsewhere, it, eventually, settled, on, the, soviets, cold, war, arch, rival, the, united, states, which, had, been, courting, the, somali, government, for, some, time, somalia, s, initial, friendship, with, the, soviet, union, and, later, partnership, with, the, united, states, enabled, it, to, build, the, largest, army, in, africa, a, new, constitution, was, promulgated, in, 1979, under, which, elections, for, a, people, s, assembly, were, held, however, barre, s, somali, revolutionary, socialist, party, politburo, continued, to, rule, in, october, 1980, the, srsp, was, disbanded, and, the, supreme, revolutionary, council, was, re, established, in, its, place, by, that, time, barre, s, government, had, become, increasingly, unpopular, many, somalis, had, become, disillusioned, with, life, under, military, dictatorship, the, regime, was, weakened, further, in, the, 1980s, as, the, cold, war, drew, to, a, close, and, somalia, s, strategic, importance, was, diminished, the, government, became, increasingly, authoritarian, and, resistance, movements, encouraged, by, ethiopia, sprang, up, across, the, country, eventually, leading, to, the, somali, civil, war, among, the, militia, groups, were, the, somali, salvation, democratic, front, ssdf, united, somali, congress, usc, somali, national, movement, snm, and, the, somali, patriotic, movement, spm, together, with, the, non, violent, political, oppositions, of, the, somali, democratic, movement, sdm, the, somali, democratic, alliance, sda, and, the, somali, manifesto, group, smg, as, the, moral, authority, of, barre, s, government, was, gradually, eroded, many, somalis, became, disillusioned, with, life, under, military, rule, by, the, mid, 1980s, resistance, movements, supported, by, ethiopia, s, communist, derg, administration, had, sprung, up, across, the, country, barre, responded, by, ordering, punitive, measures, against, those, he, perceived, as, locally, supporting, the, guerrillas, especially, in, the, northern, regions, the, clampdown, included, bombing, of, cities, with, the, northwestern, administrative, centre, of, hargeisa, a, somali, national, movement, snm, stronghold, among, the, targeted, areas, in, 1988, the, clampdown, initiated, by, barre, s, government, extended, its, reach, beyond, the, initial, bombings, in, the, north, to, encompass, various, regions, across, the, country, this, reproduction, of, aggressive, strategies, aimed, at, stifling, descent, and, retaining, authority, over, the, populace, was, a, hallmark, of, the, government, s, repressive, actions, in, the, south, one, of, the, most, notable, instances, occurred, in, 1991, when, barre, s, regime, initiated, a, ruthless, arial, assault, that, led, to, the, deaths, of, numerous, innocent, individuals, in, the, town, of, beledwene, situated, in, southern, somalia, the, cruelty, and, magnitude, of, this, atrocity, highlighted, the, degree, to, which, the, government, was, prepared, to, go, to, quash, any, sort, of, opposition, or, resistance, displaying, a, blatant, disregard, for, human, rights, and, the, worth, of, human, life, another, notable, instance, of, barre, s, repressive, policies, occurred, in, the, city, of, baidoa, which, earned, the, nickname, the, city, of, death, due, to, the, tragic, events, that, unfolded, there, during, the, famine, and, civil, war, it, is, worth, noting, that, hundreds, of, thousands, of, individuals, lost, their, lives, as, a, consequence, of, governmental, strategies, specifically, aimed, at, the, rahanweyn, community, residing, in, these, areas, during, 1990, in, the, capital, city, of, mogadishu, the, residents, were, prohibited, from, gathering, publicly, in, groups, greater, than, three, or, four, fuel, shortages, inflation, and, currency, devaluation, impacted, the, economy, a, thriving, black, market,

foreign, currency, although, no, travel, restrictions, were, placed, on, foreigners, photographing, many, locations, was, banned, during, daytime, in, mogadishu, the, appearance, of, any, government, military, force, was, extremely, rare, alleged, late, night, operations, by, government, authorities, however, included, disappearances, of, individuals, from, their, homes, in, 1991, the, barre, administration, was, ousted, by, a, coalition, of, clan, based, opposition, groups, backed, by, ethiopia, s, then, ruling, derg, regime, and, libya, following, a, meeting, of, the, somali, national, movement, and, northern, clans, elders, the, northern, former, british, portion, of, the, country, declared, its, independence, as, the, republic, of, somaliland, in, may, 1991, although, de, facto, independent, and, relatively, stable, compared, to, the, tumultuous, south, it, has, not, been, recognized, by, any, foreign, government, many, of, the, opposition, groups, subsequently, began, competing, for, influence, in, the, power, vacuum, that, followed, the, ouster, of, barre, s, regime, in, the, south, armed, factions, led, by, usc, commanders, general, mohamed, farah, aidid, and, ali, mahdi, mohamed, in, particular, clashed, as, each, sought, to, exert, authority, over, the, capital, in, 1991, a, multi, phased, international, conference, on, somalia, was, held, in, neighbouring, djibouti, owing, to, the, legitimacy, bestowed, on, muhammad, by, the, djibouti, conference, he, was, subsequently, recognized, by, the, international, community, as, the, new, president, of, somalia, he, was, not, able, to, exert, his, authority, beyond, parts, of, the, capital, power, was, instead, vied, with, other, faction, leaders, in, the, southern, half, of, somalia,
