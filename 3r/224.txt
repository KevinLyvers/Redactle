niagara, falls, n, a, r, r, ny, agg, r, gr, is, a, group, of, three, waterfalls, at, the, southern, end, of, niagara, gorge, spanning, the, border, between, the, province, of, ontario, in, canada, and, the, state, of, new, york, in, the, united, states, the, largest, of, the, three, is, horseshoe, falls, which, straddles, the, international, border, of, the, two, countries, it, is, also, known, as, the, canadian, falls, the, smaller, american, falls, and, bridal, veil, falls, lie, within, the, united, states, bridal, veil, falls, is, separated, from, horseshoe, falls, by, goat, island, and, from, american, falls, by, luna, island, with, both, islands, situated, in, new, york, formed, by, the, niagara, river, which, drains, lake, erie, into, lake, ontario, before, flowing, out, to, the, atlantic, ocean, through, the, st, lawrence, river, the, combined, falls, have, the, highest, flow, rate, of, any, waterfall, in, north, america, that, has, a, vertical, drop, of, more, than, 50, m, 160, ft, during, peak, daytime, tourist, hours, more, than, 168, 000, m, 3, 5, 9, million, cu, ft, of, water, goes, over, the, crest, of, the, falls, every, minute, horseshoe, falls, is, the, most, powerful, waterfall, in, north, america, as, measured, by, flow, rate, niagara, falls, is, famed, for, its, beauty, and, is, a, valuable, source, of, hydroelectric, power, balancing, recreational, commercial, and, industrial, uses, has, been, a, challenge, for, the, stewards, of, the, falls, since, the, 19th, century, niagara, falls, is, 27, km, 17, mi, northwest, of, buffalo, new, york, and, 69, km, 43, mi, southeast, of, toronto, between, the, twin, cities, of, niagara, falls, ontario, and, niagara, falls, new, york, niagara, falls, was, formed, when, glaciers, receded, at, the, end, of, the, wisconsin, glaciation, the, last, ice, age, and, water, from, the, newly, formed, great, lakes, carved, a, path, over, and, through, the, niagara, escarpment, en, route, to, the, atlantic, ocean, horseshoe, falls, is, about, 57, m, 187, ft, high, while, the, height, of, the, american, falls, varies, between, 21, and, 30, m, 69, and, 98, ft, because, of, the, presence, of, giant, boulders, at, its, base, the, larger, horseshoe, falls, is, about, 790, m, 2, 590, ft, wide, while, the, american, falls, is, 320, m, 1, 050, ft, wide, the, distance, between, the, american, extremity, of, niagara, falls, and, the, canadian, extremity, is, 1, 039, m, 3, 409, ft, the, peak, flow, over, horseshoe, falls, was, recorded, at, 6, 370, m, 3, 225, 000, cu, ft, per, second, the, average, annual, flow, rate, is, 2, 400, m, 3, 85, 000, cu, ft, per, second, since, the, flow, is, a, direct, function, of, the, lake, erie, water, elevation, it, typically, peaks, in, late, spring, or, early, summer, during, the, summer, months, at, least, 2, 800, m, 3, 99, 000, cu, ft, per, second, of, water, traverse, the, falls, some, 90, of, which, goes, over, horseshoe, falls, while, the, balance, is, diverted, to, hydroelectric, facilities, and, then, on, to, american, falls, and, bridal, veil, falls, this, is, accomplished, by, employing, a, weir, the, international, control, dam, with, movable, gates, upstream, from, horseshoe, falls, the, water, flow, is, halved, at, night, and, during, the, low, tourist, season, winter, months, and, only, attains, a, minimum, flow, of, 1, 400, cubic, metres, 49, 000, cu, ft, per, second, water, diversion, is, regulated, by, the, 1950, niagara, treaty, and, is, administered, by, the, international, niagara, board, of, control, the, verdant, green, color, of, the, water, flowing, over, niagara, falls, is, a, byproduct, of, the, estimated, 60, tonnes, minute, of, dissolved, salts, and, rock, flour, very, finely, ground, rock, generated, by, the, erosive, force, of, the, niagara, river, the, niagara, river, is, an, important, bird, area, due, to, its, impact, on, bonaparte, s, gulls, ring, billed, gulls, and, herring, gulls, several, thousand, birds, migrate, and, winter, in, the, surrounding, area, the, features, that, became, niagara, falls, were, created, by, the, wisconsin, glaciation, about, 10, 000, years, ago, the, retreat, of, the, ice, sheet, left, behind, a, large, amount, of, meltwater, see, lake, algonquin, lake, chicago, glacial, lake, iroquois, and, champlain, sea, that, filled, up, the, basins, that, the, glaciers, had, carved, thus, creating, the, great, lakes, as, we, know, them, today, scientists, posit, there, is, an, old, valley, st, david, s, buried, gorge, buried, by, glacial, drift, at, the, approximate, location, of, the, present, welland, canal, when, the, ice, melted, the, upper, great, lakes, emptied, into, the, niagara, river, which, followed, the, rearranged, topography, across, the, niagara, escarpment, in, time, the, river, cut, a, gorge, through, the, north, facing, cliff, or, cuesta, because, of, the, interactions, of, three, major, rock, formations, the, rocky, bed, did, not, erode, evenly, the, caprock, formation, is, composed, of, hard, erosion, resistant, limestone, and, dolomite, of, the, lockport, formation, middle, silurian, that, hard, layer, of, stone, eroded, more, slowly, than, the, underlying, materials, immediately, below, the, caprock, lies, the, weaker, softer, sloping, rochester, formation, lower, silurian, this, formation, is, composed, mainly, of, shale, though, it, has, some, thin, limestone, layers, it, also, contains, ancient, fossils, in, time, the, river, eroded, the, soft, layer, that, supported, the, hard, layers, undercutting, the, hard, caprock, which, gave, way, in, great, chunks, this, process, repeated, countless, times, eventually, carving, out, the, falls, submerged, in, the, river, in, the, lower, valley, hidden, from, view, is, the, queenston, formation, upper, ordovician, which, is, composed, of, shales, and, fine, sandstones, all, three, formations, were, laid, down, in, an, ancient, sea, their, differences, of, character, deriving, from, changing, conditions, within, that, sea, about, 10, 900, years, ago, the, niagara, falls, was, between, present, day, queenston, ontario, and, lewiston, new, york, but, erosion, of, the, crest, caused, the, falls, to, retreat, approximately, 6, 8, miles, 10, 9, km, southward, the, shape, of, horseshoe, falls, has, changed, through, the, process, of, erosion, evolving, from, a, small, arch, to, a, horseshoe, bend, to, the, present, day, v, shape, just, upstream, from, the, falls, current, location, goat, island, splits, the, course, of, the, niagara, river, resulting, in, the, separation, of, horseshoe, falls, to, the, west, from, the, american, and, bridal, veil, falls, to, the, east, engineering, has, slowed, erosion, and, recession, the, current, rate, of, erosion, is, approximately, 30, centimeters, 0, 98, feet, per, year, down, from, a, historical, average, of, 0, 91, m, 3, 0, ft, per, year, at, this, rate, in, about, 50, 000, years, niagara, falls, will, have, eroded, the, remaining, 32, km, 20, mi, to, lake, erie, and, the, falls, will, cease, to, exist, in, the, 1870s, sightseers, had, limited, access, to, niagara, falls, and, often, had, to, pay, for, a, glimpse, and, industrialization, threatened, to, carve, up, goat, island, to, further, expand, commercial, development, other, industrial, encroachments, and, lack, of, public, access, led, to, a, conservation, movement, in, the, u, s, known, as, free, niagara, led, by, such, notables, as, hudson, river, school, artist, frederic, edwin, church, landscape, designer, frederick, law, olmsted, and, architect, henry, hobson, richardson, church, approached, lord, dufferin, governor, general, of, canada, with, a, proposal, for, international, discussions, on, the, establishment, of, a, public, park, goat, island, was, one, of, the, inspirations, for, the, american, side, of, the, effort, william, dorsheimer, moved, by, the, scene, from, the, island, brought, olmsted, to, buffalo, in, 1868, to, design, a, city, park, system, which, helped, promote, olmsted, s, career, in, 1879, the, new, york, state, legislature, commissioned, olmsted, and, james, t, gardner, to, survey, the, falls, and, to, create, the, single, most, important, document, in, the, niagara, preservation, movement, a, special, report, on, the, preservation, of, niagara, falls, the, report, advocated, for, state, purchase, restoration, and, preservation, through, public, ownership, of, the, scenic, lands, surrounding, niagara, falls, restoring, the, former, beauty, of, the, falls, was, described, in, the, report, as, a, sacred, obligation, to, mankind, in, 1883, new, york, governor, grover, cleveland, drafted, legislation, authorizing, acquisition, of, lands, for, a, state, reservation, at, niagara, and, the, niagara, falls, association, a, private, citizens, group, founded, in, 1882, mounted, a, great, letter, writing, campaign, and, petition, drive, in, support, of, the, park, professor, charles, eliot, norton, and, olmsted, were, among, the, leaders, of, the, public, campaign, while, new, york, governor, alonzo, cornell, opposed, preservationists, efforts, were, rewarded, on, april, 30, 1885, when, governor, david, b, hill, signed, legislation, creating, the, niagara, reservation, new, york, s, first, state, park, new, york, state, began, to, purchase, land, from, developers, under, the, charter, of, the, niagara, reservation, state, park, in, the, same, year, the, province, of, ontario, established, the, queen, victoria, niagara, falls, park, for, the, same, purpose, on, the, canadian, side, the, niagara, parks, commission, governs, land, usage, along, the, entire, course, of, the, niagara, river, from, lake, erie, to, lake, ontario, in, 1887, olmsted, and, calvert, vaux, issued, a, supplemental, report, detailing, plans, to, restore, the, falls, their, intent, was, to, restore, and, conserve, the, natural, surroundings, of, the, falls, of, niagara, rather, than, to, attempt, to, add, anything, thereto, and, the, report, anticipated, fundamental, questions, such, as, how, to, provide, access, without, destroying, the, beauty, of, the, falls, and, how, to, restore, natural, landscapes, damaged, by, man, they, planned, a, park, with, scenic, roadways, paths, and, a, few, shelters, designed, to, protect, the, landscape, while, allowing, large, numbers, of, visitors, to, enjoy, the, falls, commemorative, statues, shops, restaurants, and, a, 1959, glass, and, metal, observation, tower, were, added, later, preservationists, continue, to, strive, to, strike, a, balance, between, olmsted, s, idyllic, vision, and, the, realities, of, administering, a, popular, scenic, attraction, preservation, efforts, continued, well, into, the, 20th, century, j, horace, mcfarland, the, sierra, club, and, the, appalachian, mountain, club, persuaded, the, united, states, congress, in, 1906, to, enact, legislation, to, preserve, the, falls, by, regulating, the, waters, of, the, niagara, river, the, act, sought, in, cooperation, with, the, canadian, government, to, restrict, diversion, of, water, and, a, treaty, resulted, in, 1909, that, limited, the, total, amount, of, water, diverted, from, the, falls, by, both, nations, to, approximately, 56, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, 1, 600, m, 3, s, that, limitation, remained, in, effect, until, 1950, erosion, control, efforts, have, always, been, of, importance, underwater, weirs, redirect, the, most, damaging, currents, and, the, top, of, the, falls, has, been, strengthened, in, june, 1969, a, temporary, rock, and, earth, dam, was, constructed, completely, diverting, the, niagara, river, from, american, falls, for, several, months, during, this, time, two, bodies, were, removed, from, under, the, falls, including, a, man, who, had, been, seen, jumping, over, the, falls, and, the, body, of, a, woman, which, was, discovered, once, the, falls, dried, while, horseshoe, falls, absorbed, the, extra, flow, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, studied, the, riverbed, and, mechanically, bolted, and, strengthened, any, faults, they, found, faults, that, would, if, left, untreated, have, hastened, the, retreat, of, american, falls, a, plan, to, remove, the, huge, mound, of, talus, deposited, in, 1954, was, abandoned, owing, to, cost, and, in, november, 1969, the, temporary, dam, was, dynamited, restoring, flow, to, american, falls, even, after, these, undertakings, luna, island, the, small, piece, of, land, between, the, american, falls, and, bridal, veil, falls, remained, off, limits, to, the, public, for, years, owing, to, fears, that, it, was, unstable, and, could, collapse, into, the, gorge, commercial, interests, have, continued, to, encroach, on, the, land, surrounding, the, state, park, including, the, construction, of, several, tall, buildings, most, of, them, hotels, on, the, canadian, side, the, result, is, a, significant, alteration, and, urbanisation, of, the, landscape, one, study, found, that, the, tall, buildings, changed, the, breeze, patterns, and, increased, the, number, of, mist, days, from, 29, per, year, to, 68, per, year, but, another, study, disputed, this, idea, in, 2013, new, york, state, began, an, effort, to, renovate, three, sisters, islands, located, south, of, goat, island, funds, were, used, from, the, re, licensing, of, the, new, york, power, authority, hydroelectric, plant, downriver, in, lewiston, new, york, to, rebuild, walking, paths, on, the, three, sisters, islands, and, to, plant, native, vegetation, on, the, islands, the, state, also, renovated, the, area, around, prospect, point, at, the, brink, of, american, falls, in, the, state, park, theories, differ, as, to, the, origin, of, the, name, of, the, falls, the, native, american, word, ongiara, means, thundering, water, the, new, york, times, used, this, in, 1925, according, to, iroquoian, scholar, bruce, trigger, niagara, is, derived, from, the, name, given, to, a, branch, of, the, local, native, neutral, confederacy, who, are, described, as, the, niagagarega, people, on, several, late, 17th, century, french, maps, of, the, area, according, to, george, r, stewart, it, comes, from, the, name, of, an, iroquois, town, called, onguiaahra, meaning, point, of, land, cut, in, two, in, 1847, an, iroquois, interpreter, stated, that, the, name, came, from, jaonniaka, re, meaning, noisy, point, or, portage, to, mohawks, the, name, refers, to, the, neck, pronounced, onyara, the, portage, or, neck, of, land, between, lakes, erie, and, ontario, onyara, many, figures, have, been, suggested, as, first, circulating, a, european, eyewitness, description, of, niagara, falls, the, frenchman, samuel, de, champlain, visited, the, area, as, early, as, 1604, during, his, exploration, of, what, is, now, canada, and, members, of, his, party, reported, to, him, the, spectacular, waterfalls, which, he, described, in, his, journals, the, first, description, of, the, falls, is, credited, to, belgian, missionary, father, louis, hennepin, in, 1677, after, traveling, with, the, explorer, ren, robert, cavelier, sieur, de, la, salle, thus, bringing, the, falls, to, the, attention, of, europeans, french, jesuit, missionary, paul, ragueneau, likely, visited, the, falls, some, 35, years, before, hennepin, s, visit, while, working, among, the, huron, first, nation, in, canada, jean, de, br, beuf, also, may, have, visited, the, falls, while, spending, time, with, the, neutral, nation, the, finnish, swedish, naturalist, pehr, kalm, explored, the, area, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, is, credited, with, the, first, scientific, description, of, the, falls, in, 1762, captain, thomas, davies, a, british, army, officer, and, artist, surveyed, the, area, and, painted, the, watercolor, an, east, view, of, the, great, cataract, of, niagara, the, first, eyewitness, painting, of, the, falls, during, the, 19th, century, tourism, became, popular, and, by, the, mid, century, it, was, the, area, s, main, industry, theodosia, burr, alston, daughter, of, vice, president, aaron, burr, and, her, husband, joseph, alston, were, the, first, recorded, couple, to, honeymoon, there, in, 1801, napoleon, bonaparte, s, brother, j, r, me, visited, with, his, bride, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, 1825, british, explorer, john, franklin, visited, the, falls, while, passing, through, new, york, en, route, to, cumberland, house, as, part, of, his, second, arctic, expedition, calling, them, so, justly, celebrated, as, the, first, in, the, world, for, grandeur, in, 1843, frederick, douglass, joined, the, american, anti, slavery, society, s, one, hundred, conventions, tour, throughout, new, york, and, the, midwest, sometime, on, this, tour, douglass, visited, niagara, falls, and, wrote, a, brief, account, of, the, experience, when, i, came, into, its, awful, presence, the, power, of, discription, failed, me, an, irrisistible, power, closed, my, lips, being, on, the, canadian, border, niagara, falls, was, on, one, of, the, routes, of, the, underground, railroad, the, falls, were, also, a, popular, tourist, attraction, for, southern, slaveowners, who, would, bring, their, enslaved, workers, on, the, trip, many, a, time, the, trusted, body, servant, or, slave, girl, would, leave, master, or, mistress, in, the, discharge, of, some, errand, and, never, come, back, this, sometimes, led, to, conflict, early, town, father, peter, porter, assisted, slavecatchers, in, finding, runaway, slaves, even, leading, in, the, case, of, runaway, solomon, moseby, to, a, riot, in, niagara, on, the, lake, canada, much, of, this, history, is, memorialized, in, the, niagara, falls, underground, railroad, heritage, center, after, the, american, civil, war, the, new, york, central, railroad, publicized, niagara, falls, as, a, focus, of, pleasure, and, honeymoon, visits, after, world, war, ii, the, auto, industry, along, with, local, tourism, boards, began, to, promote, niagara, honeymoons, in, about, 1840, the, english, industrial, chemist, hugh, lee, pattinson, traveled, to, canada, stopping, at, niagara, falls, long, enough, to, make, the, earliest, known, photograph, of, the, falls, a, daguerreotype, in, the, collection, of, newcastle, university, it, was, once, believed, that, the, small, figure, standing, silhouetted, with, a, top, hat, was, added, by, an, engraver, working, from, imagination, as, well, as, the, daguerreotype, as, his, source, but, the, figure, is, clearly, present, in, the, photograph, because, of, the, very, long, exposure, required, of, ten, minutes, or, more, the, figure, is, assumed, by, canada, s, niagara, parks, agency, to, be, pattinson, the, image, is, left, right, inverted, and, taken, from, the, canadian, side, pattinson, made, other, photographs, of, horseshoe, falls, these, were, then, transferred, to, engravings, to, illustrate, no, l, marie, paymal, lerebours, excursions, daguerriennes, paris, 1841, 1864, on, august, 6, 1918, an, iron, scow, became, stuck, on, the, rocks, above, the, falls, the, two, men, on, the, scow, were, rescued, but, the, vessel, remained, trapped, on, rocks, in, the, river, and, is, still, visible, there, in, a, deteriorated, state, although, its, position, shifted, by, 50, meters, 160, ft, during, a, storm, on, october, 31, 2019, daredevil, william, red, hill, sr, was, particularly, praised, for, his, role, in, the, rescue, after, the, first, world, war, tourism, boomed, as, automobiles, made, getting, to, the, falls, much, easier, the, story, of, niagara, falls, in, the, 20th, century, is, largely, that, of, efforts, to, harness, the, energy, of, the, falls, for, hydroelectric, power, and, to, control, the, development, on, both, sides, that, threaten, the, area, s, natural, beauty, before, the, late, 20th, century, the, northeastern, end, of, horseshoe, falls, was, in, the, united, states, flowing, around, the, terrapin, rocks, which, were, once, connected, to, goat, island, by, a, series, of, bridges, in, 1955, the, area, between, the, rocks, and, goat, island, was, filled, in, creating, terrapin, point, in, the, early, 1980s, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, filled, in, more, land, and, built, diversion, dams, and, retaining, walls, to, force, the, water, away, from, terrapin, point, altogether, 400, ft, 120, m, of, horseshoe, falls, were, eliminated, including, 100, ft, 30, m, on, the, canadian, side, according, to, author, ginger, strand, the, horseshoe, falls, is, now, entirely, in, canada, other, sources, say, most, of, horseshoe, falls, is, in, canada, the, only, recorded, freeze, up, of, the, river, and, falls, was, caused, by, an, ice, jam, on, march, 29, 1848, no, water, or, at, best, a, trickle, fell, for, as, much, as, 40, hours, waterwheels, stopped, and, mills, and, factories, shut, down, for, having, no, power, in, 1912, american, falls, was, completely, frozen, but, the, other, two, falls, kept, flowing, although, the, falls, commonly, ice, up, most, winters, the, river, and, the, falls, do, not, freeze, completely, the, years, 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014, 2017, and, 2019, are, noted, for, partial, freezing, of, the, falls, a, so, called, ice, bridge, was, common, in, certain, years, at, the, base, of, the, falls, and, was, used, by, people, who, wanted, to, cross, the, river, before, bridges, had, been, built, during, some, winters, the, ice, sheet, was, as, thick, as, 40, to, 100, feet, 12, to, 30, m, but, that, thickness, has, not, occurred, since, 1954, the, ice, bridge, of, 1841, was, said, to, be, at, least, 100, feet, thick, on, february, 4, 1912, the, ice, bridge, which, had, formed, on, january, 15, began, breaking, up, while, people, were, still, on, it, many, escaped, but, three, died, during, the, event, later, named, the, ice, bridge, tragedy, a, number, of, bridges, have, spanned, the, niagara, river, in, the, general, vicinity, of, the, falls, the, first, not, far, from, the, whirlpool, was, a, suspension, bridge, above, the, gorge, it, opened, for, use, by, the, public, in, july, 1848, and, remained, in, use, until, 1855, a, second, bridge, in, the, upper, falls, area, was, commissioned, with, two, levels, or, decks, one, for, use, by, the, great, western, railway, this, niagara, falls, suspension, bridge, opened, in, 1855, it, was, used, by, conductors, on, the, underground, railroad, to, escort, runaway, slaves, to, canada, in, 1882, the, grand, trunk, railway, took, over, control, of, the, second, deck, after, it, absorbed, the, great, western, company, significant, structural, improvements, were, made, in, the, late, 1870s, and, then, in, 1886, this, bridge, remained, in, use, until, 1897, because, of, the, volume, of, traffic, the, decision, was, made, to, construct, a, new, arch, bridge, nearby, under, and, around, the, existing, bridge, after, it, opened, in, september, 1897, a, decision, was, made, to, remove, and, scrap, the, railway, suspension, bridge, this, new, bridge, was, initially, known, as, the, niagara, railway, arch, or, lower, steel, arch, bridge, it, had, two, decks, the, lower, one, used, for, carriages, and, the, upper, for, trains, in, 1937, it, was, renamed, the, whirlpool, rapids, bridge, and, remains, in, use, today, all, of, the, structures, built, up, to, that, time, were, referred, to, as, lower, niagara, bridges, and, were, some, distance, from, the, falls, the, first, bridge, in, the, so, called, upper, niagara, area, closer, to, the, falls, was, a, two, level, suspension, structure, that, opened, in, january, 1869, it, was, destroyed, during, a, severe, storm, in, january, 1889, the, replacement, was, built, quickly, and, opened, in, may, 1889, in, order, to, handle, heavy, traffic, a, second, bridge, was, commissioned, slightly, closer, to, american, falls, this, one, was, a, steel, bridge, and, opened, to, traffic, in, june, 1897, it, was, known, as, the, upper, steel, arch, bridge, but, was, often, called, the, honeymoon, bridge, the, single, level, included, a, track, for, trolleys, and, space, for, carriages, and, pedestrians, the, design, led, to, the, bridge, being, very, close, to, the, surface, of, the, river, and, in, january, 1938, an, ice, jam, twisted, the, steel, frame, of, the, bridge, which, later, collapsed, on, january, 27, 1938, another, lower, niagara, bridge, had, been, commissioned, in, 1883, by, cornelius, vanderbilt, for, use, by, railways, at, a, location, roughly, approximately, 200, feet, south, of, the, railway, suspension, bridge, this, one, was, of, an, entirely, different, design, it, was, a, cantilever, bridge, to, provide, greater, strength, the, niagara, cantilever, bridge, had, two, cantilevers, which, were, joined, by, steel, sections, it, opened, officially, in, december, 1883, and, improvements, were, made, over, the, years, for, a, stronger, structure, as, rail, traffic, was, increasing, the, michigan, central, railroad, company, decided, to, build, a, new, bridge, in, 1923, to, be, located, between, the, lower, steel, arch, bridge, and, the, cantilever, bridge, the, michigan, central, railway, bridge, opened, in, february, 1925, and, remained, in, use, until, the, early, 21st, century, the, cantilever, bridge, was, removed, and, scrapped, after, the, new, rail, bridge, opened, nonetheless, it, was, inducted, into, the, north, america, railway, hall, of, fame, in, 2006, there, was, a, lengthy, dispute, as, to, which, agency, should, build, the, replacement, for, the, niagara, railway, arch, or, lower, steel, arch, bridge, in, the, upper, niagara, area, when, that, was, resolved, construction, of, a, steel, bridge, commenced, in, february, 1940, named, the, rainbow, bridge, and, featuring, two, lanes, for, traffic, separated, by, a, barrier, it, opened, in, november, 1941, and, remains, in, use, today, the, enormous, energy, of, niagara, falls, has, long, been, recognized, as, a, potential, source, of, power, the, first, known, effort, to, harness, the, waters, was, in, 1750, when, daniel, joncaire, built, a, small, canal, above, the, falls, to, power, his, sawmill, augustus, and, peter, porter, purchased, this, area, and, all, of, american, falls, in, 1805, from, the, new, york, state, government, and, enlarged, the, original, canal, to, provide, hydraulic, power, for, their, gristmill, and, tannery, in, 1853, the, niagara, falls, hydraulic, power, and, mining, company, was, chartered, which, eventually, constructed, the, canals, that, would, be, used, to, generate, electricity, in, 1881, under, the, leadership, of, jacob, f, schoellkopf, the, niagara, river, s, first, hydroelectric, generating, station, was, built, the, water, fell, 86, feet, 26, m, and, generated, direct, current, electricity, which, ran, the, machinery, of, local, mills, and, lit, up, some, of, the, village, streets, the, niagara, falls, power, company, a, descendant, of, schoellkopf, s, firm, formed, the, cataract, company, headed, by, edward, dean, adams, with, the, intent, of, expanding, niagara, falls, power, capacity, in, 1890, a, five, member, international, niagara, commission, headed, by, sir, william, thomson, among, other, distinguished, scientists, deliberated, on, the, expansion, of, niagara, hydroelectric, capacity, based, on, seventeen, proposals, but, could, not, select, any, as, the, best, combined, project, for, hydraulic, development, and, distribution, in, 1893, westinghouse, electric, which, had, built, the, smaller, scale, ames, hydroelectric, generating, plant, near, ophir, colorado, two, years, earlier, was, hired, to, design, a, system, to, generate, alternating, current, on, niagara, falls, and, three, years, after, that, a, large, scale, ac, power, system, was, created, activated, on, august, 26, 1895, the, adams, power, plant, transformer, house, remains, as, a, landmark, of, the, original, system, by, 1896, financing, from, moguls, including, j, p, morgan, john, jacob, astor, iv, and, the, vanderbilts, had, fueled, the, construction, of, giant, underground, conduits, leading, to, turbines, generating, upwards, of, 100, 000, horsepower, 75, mw, sent, as, far, as, buffalo, 20, mi, 32, km, away, some, of, the, original, designs, for, the, power, transmission, plants, were, created, by, the, swiss, firm, faesch, piccard, which, also, constructed, the, original, 5, 000, hp, 3, 7, mw, waterwheels, private, companies, on, the, canadian, side, also, began, to, harness, the, energy, of, the, falls, the, government, of, ontario, eventually, brought, power, transmission, operations, under, public, control, in, 1906, distributing, niagara, s, energy, to, various, parts, of, the, canadian, province, other, hydropower, plants, were, being, built, along, the, niagara, river, but, in, 1956, disaster, struck, when, the, region, s, largest, hydropower, station, was, partially, destroyed, in, a, landslide, this, drastically, reduced, power, production, and, put, tens, of, thousands, of, manufacturing, jobs, at, stake, in, 1957, congress, passed, the, niagara, redevelopment, act, which, granted, the, new, york, power, authority, the, right, to, fully, develop, the, united, states, share, of, the, niagara, river, s, hydroelectric, potential, in, 1961, when, the, niagara, falls, hydroelectric, project, went, online, it, was, the, largest, hydropower, facility, in, the, western, world, today, niagara, is, still, the, largest, electricity, producer, in, new, york, state, with, a, generating, capacity, of, 2, 4, gw, up, to, 1, 420, cubic, metres, 380, 000, us, gal, of, water, per, second, is, diverted, from, the, niagara, river, through, conduits, under, the, city, of, niagara, falls, to, the, lewiston, and, robert, moses, power, plants, currently, between, 50, and, 75, of, the, niagara, river, s, flow, is, diverted, via, four, huge, tunnels, that, arise, far, upstream, from, the, waterfalls, the, water, then, passes, through, hydroelectric, turbines, that, supply, power, to, nearby, areas, of, canada, and, the, united, states, before, returning, to, the, river, well, past, the, falls, when, electrical, demand, is, low, the, lewiston, units, can, operate, as, pumps, to, transport, water, from, the, lower, bay, back, up, to, the, plant, s, reservoir, allowing, this, water, to, be, used, again, during, the, daytime, when, electricity, use, peaks, during, peak, electrical, demand, the, same, lewiston, pumps, are, reversed, and, become, generators, to, preserve, niagara, falls, natural, beauty, a, 1950, treaty, signed, by, the, u, s, and, canada, limited, water, usage, by, the, power, plants, the, treaty, allows, higher, summertime, diversion, at, night, when, tourists, are, fewer, and, during, the, winter, months, when, there, are, even, fewer, tourists, this, treaty, designed, to, ensure, an, unbroken, curtain, of, water, flowing, over, the, falls, states, that, during, daylight, time, during, the, tourist, season, april, 1, to, october, 31, there, must, be, 100, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, 2, 800, m, 3, s, of, water, flowing, over, the, falls, and, during, the, night, and, off, tourist, season, there, must, be, 50, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, 1, 400, m, 3, s, of, water, flowing, over, the, falls, this, treaty, is, monitored, by, the, international, niagara, board, of, control, using, a, noaa, gauging, station, above, the, falls, during, winter, the, power, authority, of, new, york, works, with, ontario, power, generation, to, prevent, ice, on, the, niagara, river, from, interfering, with, power, production, or, causing, flooding, of, shoreline, property, one, of, their, joint, efforts, is, an, 8, 800, foot, long, 2, 700, m, ice, boom, which, prevents, the, buildup, of, ice, yet, allows, water, to, continue, flowing, downstream, in, addition, to, minimum, water, volume, the, crest, of, horseshoe, falls, was, reduced, to, maintain, an, uninterrupted, curtain, of, water, in, august, 2005, ontario, power, generation, which, is, responsible, for, the, sir, adam, beck, stations, started, a, major, civil, engineering, project, called, the, niagara, tunnel, project, to, increase, power, production, by, building, a, new, 12, 7, metre, 42, ft, diameter, 10, 2, kilometre, long, 6, 3, mi, water, diversion, tunnel, it, was, officially, placed, into, service, in, march, 2013, helping, to, increase, the, generating, complex, s, nameplate, capacity, by, 150, megawatts, it, did, so, by, tapping, water, from, farther, up, the, niagara, river, than, was, possible, with, the, preexisting, arrangement, the, tunnel, provided, new, hydroelectricity, for, approximately, 160, 000, homes, ships, can, bypass, niagara, falls, by, means, of, the, welland, canal, which, was, improved, and, incorporated, into, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, in, the, mid, 1950s, while, the, seaway, diverted, water, traffic, from, nearby, buffalo, and, led, to, the, demise, of, its, steel, and, grain, mills, other, industries, in, the, niagara, river, valley, flourished, with, the, help, of, the, electric, power, produced, by, the, river, however, since, the, 1970s, the, region, has, declined, economically, the, cities, of, niagara, falls, ontario, canada, and, niagara, falls, new, york, united, states, are, connected, by, two, international, bridges, the, rainbow, bridge, just, downriver, from, the, falls, affords, the, closest, view, of, the, falls, and, is, open, to, non, commercial, vehicle, traffic, and, pedestrians, the, whirlpool, rapids, bridge, lies, one, mile, 1, 6, km, north, of, the, rainbow, bridge, and, is, the, oldest, bridge, over, the, niagara, river, nearby, niagara, falls, international, airport, and, buffalo, niagara, international, airport, were, named, after, the, waterfall, as, were, niagara, university, countless, local, businesses, and, even, an, asteroid, the, first, recorded, publicity, stunt, using, the, falls, was, the, wreck, of, the, schooner, michigan, in, 1827, local, hotel, owners, acquired, a, former, lake, erie, freighter, loaded, it, with, animals, and, effigies, of, people, towed, it, to, a, spot, above, the, falls, and, let, it, plunge, over, the, brink, admission, of, fifty, cents, was, charged, in, october, 1829, sam, patch, who, called, himself, the, yankee, leapster, jumped, from, a, high, tower, into, the, gorge, below, the, falls, and, survived, this,

as, a, publicity, stunt, she, survived, bleeding, but, otherwise, unharmed, soon, after, exiting, the, barrel, she, said, no, one, ought, ever, do, that, again, days, before, taylor, s, attempt, her, domestic, cat, was, sent, over, the, falls, in, her, barrel, to, test, its, strength, the, cat, survived, the, plunge, unharmed, and, later, posed, with, taylor, in, photographs, since, taylor, s, historic, ride, over, a, dozen, people, have, intentionally, gone, over, the, falls, in, or, on, a, device, despite, her, advice, some, have, survived, unharmed, but, others, have, drowned, or, been, severely, injured, survivors, face, charges, and, stiff, fines, as, it, is, now, illegal, on, both, sides, of, the, border, to, attempt, to, go, over, the, falls, charles, stephens, a, 58, year, old,

his, barrel, released, prematurely, it, hit, the, side, of, the, tank, and, he, died, the, next, day, from, his, injuries, in, august, 1985, steve, trotter, an, aspiring, stuntman, from, rhode, island, became, the, youngest, person, ever, age, 22, and, the, first, american, in, 25, years, to, go, over, the, falls, in, a, barrel, ten, years, later, trotter, went, over, the, falls, again, becoming, the, second, person, to, go, over, the, falls, twice, and, survive, it, was, also, the, second, duo, lori, martin, joined, trotter, for, the, barrel, ride, over, the, falls, they, survived,
