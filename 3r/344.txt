the, range, has, some, of, the, earth, s, highest, peaks, including, the, highest, mount, everest, more, than, 100, peaks, exceeding, elevations, of, 7, 200, m, 23, 600, ft, above, sea, level, lie, in, the, himalayas, the, himalayas, abut, or, cross, six, countries, nepal, china, pakistan, bhutan, india, and, afghanistan, the, sovereignty, of, the, range, in, the, kashmir, region, is, disputed, among, india, pakistan, and, china, the, himalayan, range, is, bordered, on, the, northwest, by, the, karakoram, and, hindu, kush, ranges, on, the, north, by, the, tibetan, plateau, and, on, the, south, by, the, indo, gangetic, plain, some, of, the, world, s, major, rivers, the, indus, the, ganges, and, the, tsangpo, brahmaputra, rise, in, the, vicinity, of, the, himalayas, and, their, combined, drainage, basin, is, home, to, some, 600, million, people, 53, million, people, live, in, the, himalayas, the, himalayas, have, profoundly, shaped, the, cultures, of, south, asia, and, tibet, many, himalayan, peaks, are, sacred, in, hinduism, and, buddhism, the, summits, of, several, kangchenjunga, from, the, indian, side, gangkhar, puensum, machapuchare, nanda, devi, and, kailash, in, the, tibetan, transhimalaya, are, off, limits, to, climbers, lifted, by, the, subduction, of, the, indian, tectonic, plate, under, the, eurasian, plate, the, himalayan, mountain, range, runs, west, northwest, to, east, southeast, in, an, arc, 2, 400, km, 1, 500, mi, long, its, western, anchor, nanga, parbat, lies, just, south, of, the, northernmost, bend, of, the, indus, river, its, eastern, anchor, namcha, barwa, lies, immediately, west, of, the, great, bend, of, the, yarlung, tsangpo, river, the, range, varies, in, width, from, 350, km, 220, mi, in, the, west, to, 150, km, 93, mi, in, the, east, the, name, of, the, range, hails, from, the, sanskrit, him, laya, abode, of, snow, from, hima, frost, cold, and, laya, dwelling, house, they, are, now, known, as, the, himalaya, mountains, usually, shortened, to, the, himalayas, the, mountains, are, known, as, the, him, laya, in, nepali, and, hindi, both, written, hinv, l, in, garhwali, him, l, in, kumaoni, the, himalaya, or, the, land, of, snow, in, tibetan, also, known, as, him, laya, in, sinhala, written, as, the, him, liya, mountain, range, in, urdu, the, himaloy, parvatmala, in, bengali, and, the, ximalaya, mountain, range, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, x, m, l, y, sh, nm, i, in, chinese, the, name, of, the, range, is, sometimes, also, given, as, himavan, in, older, writings, including, the, sanskrit, epic, mahabharata, himavat, sanskrit, or, himavan, himav, n, sanskrit, is, a, hindu, deity, who, is, the, personification, of, the, himalayan, mountain, range, other, epithets, include, himaraja, sanskrit, lit, king, of, snow, or, parvateshwara, sanskrit, lit, lord, of, mountains, in, western, literature, some, writers, refer, to, it, as, the, himalaya, this, was, also, previously, transcribed, as, himmaleh, as, in, emily, dickinson, s, poetry, and, henry, david, thoreau, s, essays, the, himalayas, consists, of, four, parallel, mountain, ranges, from, south, to, north, the, sivalik, hills, on, the, south, the, lower, himalayan, range, the, great, himalayas, which, is, the, highest, and, central, range, and, the, tibetan, himalayas, on, the, north, the, karakoram, are, generally, considered, separate, from, the, himalayas, in, the, middle, of, the, great, curve, of, the, himalayan, mountains, lie, the, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, peaks, of, dhaulagiri, and, annapurna, in, nepal, separated, by, the, kali, gandaki, gorge, the, gorge, splits, the, himalayas, into, western, and, eastern, sections, both, ecologically, and, orographically, the, pass, at, the, head, of, the, kali, gandaki, the, kora, la, is, the, lowest, point, on, the, ridgeline, between, everest, and, k2, the, highest, peak, of, the, karakoram, range, to, the, east, of, annapurna, are, the, 8, 000,

east, of, the, kathmandu, valley, lies, the, valley, of, the, bhote, sun, kosi, river, which, rises, in, tibet, and, provides, the, main, overland, route, between, nepal, and, china, the, araniko, highway, china, national, highway, 318, further, east, is, the, mahalangur, himal, with, four, of, the, world, s, six, highest, mountains, including, the, highest, cho, oyu, everest, lhotse, and, makalu, the, khumbu, region, popular, for, trekking, is, found, here, on, the, south, western, approaches, to, everest, the, arun, river, drains, the, northern, slopes, of, these, mountains, before, turning, south, and, flowing, to, the, range, to, the, east, of, makalu, in, the, far, east, of, nepal, the, himalayas, rise, to, the, kangchenjunga, massif, on, the, border, with, india, the, third, highest, mountain, in, the, world, the, most, easterly, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, summit, and, the, highest, point, of, india, the, eastern, side, of, kangchenjunga, is, in, the, indian, state, of, sikkim, formerly, an, independent, kingdom, it, lies, on, the, main, route, from, india, to, lhasa, tibet, which, passes, over, the, nathu, la, pass, into, tibet, east, of, sikkim, lies, the, ancient, buddhist, kingdom, of, bhutan, the, highest, mountain, in, bhutan, is, gangkhar, puensum, which, is, also, a, strong, candidate, for, the, highest, unclimbed, mountain, in, the, world, the, himalayas, here, are, becoming, increasingly, rugged, with, heavily, forested, steep, valleys, the, himalayas, continue, turning, slightly, northeast, through, the, indian, state, of, arunachal, pradesh, as, well, as, tibet, before, reaching, their, easterly, conclusion, in, the, peak, of, namche, barwa, situated, in, tibet, inside, the, great, bend, of, the, yarlang, tsangpo, river, on, the, other, side, of, the, tsangpo, to, the, east, are, the, kangri, garpo, mountains, the, high, mountains, to, the, north, of, the, tsangpo, including, gyala, peri, however, are, also, sometimes, included, in, the, himalayas, going, west, from, dhaulagiri, western, nepal, is, somewhat, remote, and, lacks, major, high, mountains, but, is, home, to, rara, lake, the, largest, lake, in, nepal, the, karnali, river, rises, in, tibet, but, cuts, through, the, centre, of, the, region, further, west, the, border, with, india, follows, the, sarda, river, and, provides, a, trade, route, into, china, where, on, the, tibetan, plateau, lies, the, high, peak, of, gurla, mandhata, just, across, lake, manasarovar, from, this, lies, the, sacred, mount, kailash, in, the, kailash, ranges, which, stands, close, to, the, source, of, the, four, main, rivers, of, himalayas, and, is, revered, in, hinduism, jainism, buddhism, sufism, and, bonpo, in, uttarakhand, the, himalayas, are, regionally, divided, into, the, kumaon, and, garhwal, himalayas, with, the, high, peaks, of, nanda, devi, and, kamet, the, state, is, also, home, to, the, important, pilgrimage, destinations, of, chota, chaar, dhaam, with, gangotri, the, source, of, the, holy, river, ganges, yamunotri, the, source, of, the, river, yamuna, and, the, temples, at, badrinath, and, kedarnath, the, next, himalayan, indian, state, himachal, pradesh, is, noted, for, its, hill, stations, particularly, shimla, the, summer, capital, of, the, british, raj, and, dharamsala, the, centre, of, the, tibetan, community, and, government, in, exile, in, india, this, area, marks, the, start, of, the, punjab, himalaya, and, the, sutlej, river, the, most, easterly, of, the, five, tributaries, of, the, indus, cuts, through, the, range, here, further, west, the, himalayas, form, much, of, the, disputed, indian, administered, union, territory, of, jammu, and, kashmir, where, lie, the, mountainous, jammu, region, and, the, renowned, kashmir, valley, with, the, town, and, lakes, of, srinagar, the, himalayas, form, most, of, the, south, west, portion, of, the, disputed, indian, administered, union, territory, of, ladakh, the, twin, peaks, of, nun, kun, are, the, only, mountains, over, 7, 000, m, 4, 3, mi, in, this, part, of, the, himalayas, finally, the, himalayas, reach, their, western, end, in, the, dramatic, 8000, m, peak, of, nanga, parbat, which, rises, over, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, above, the, indus, valley, and, is, the, most, westerly, of, the, 8000, m, summits, the, western, end, terminates, at, a, magnificent, point, near, nanga, parbat, where, the, himalayas, intersect, with, the, karakoram, and, hindu, kush, ranges, in, the, disputed, pakistani, administered, territory, of, gilgit, baltistan, some, portion, of, the, himalayas, such, as, the, kaghan, valley, margalla, hills, and, galyat, tract, extend, into, the, pakistani, provinces, of, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, and, punjab, the, himalayan, range, is, one, of, the, youngest, mountain, ranges, on, the, planet, and, consists, mostly, of, uplifted, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rock, according, to, the, modern, theory, of, plate, tectonics, its, formation, is, a, result, of, a, continental, collision, or, orogeny, along, the, convergent, boundary, main, himalayan, thrust, between, the, indo, australian, plate, and, the, eurasian, plate, the, arakan, yoma, highlands, in, myanmar, and, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, in, the, bay, of, bengal, were, also, formed, as, a, result, of, this, collision, during, the, upper, cretaceous, about, 70, million, years, ago, the, north, moving, indo, australian, plate, which, has, subsequently, broken, into, the, indian, plate, and, the, australian, plate, was, moving, at, about, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, per, year, about, 50, million, years, ago, this, fast, moving, indo, australian, plate, had, completely, closed, the, tethys, ocean, the, existence, of, which, has, been, determined, by, sedimentary, rocks, settled, on, the, ocean, floor, and, the, volcanoes, that, fringed, its, edges, since, both, plates, were, composed, of, low, density, continental, crust, they, were, thrust, faulted, and, folded, into, mountain, ranges, rather, than, subducting, into, the, mantle, along, an, oceanic, trench, an, often, cited, fact, used, to, illustrate, this, process, is, that, the, summit, of, mount, everest, is, made, of, unmetamorphosed, marine, ordovician, limestone, with, fossil, trilobites, crinoids, and, ostracods, from, this, ancient, ocean, today, the, indian, plate, continues, to, be, driven, horizontally, at, the, tibetan, plateau, which, forces, the, plateau, to, continue, to, move, upwards, the, indian, plate, is, still, moving, at, 67, mm, 2, 6, in, per, year, and, over, the, next, 10, million, years, it, will, travel, about, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, into, asia, about, 20, mm, per, year, of, the, india, asia, convergence, is, absorbed, by, thrusting, along, the, himalaya, southern, front, this, leads, to, the, himalayas, rising, by, about, 5, mm, per, year, making, them, geologically, active, the, movement, of, the, indian, plate, into, the, asian, plate, also, makes, this, region, seismically, active, leading, to, earthquakes, from, time, to, time, during, the, last, ice, age, there, was, a, connected, ice, stream, of, glaciers, between, kangchenjunga, in, the, east, and, nanga, parbat, in, the, west, in, the, west, the, glaciers, joined, with, the, ice, stream, network, in, the, karakoram, and, in, the, north, they, joined, with, the, former, tibetan, inland, ice, to, the, south, outflow, glaciers, came, to, an, end, below, an, elevation, of, 1, 000, 2, 000, m, 3, 300, 6, 600, ft, while, the, current, valley, glaciers, of, the, himalaya, reach, at, most, 20, to, 32, km, 12, to, 20, mi, in, length, several, of, the, main, valley, glaciers, were, 60, to, 112, km, 37, to, 70, mi, long, during, the, ice, age, the, glacier, snowline, the, altitude, where, accumulation, and, ablation, of, a, glacier, are, balanced, was, about, 1, 400, 1, 660, m, 4, 590, 5, 450, ft, lower, than, it, is, today, thus, the, climate, was, at, least, 7, 0, to, 8, 3, c, 12, 6, to, 14, 9, f, colder, than, it, is, today, despite, their, scale, the, himalayas, do, not, form, a, major, continental, divide, and, a, number, of, rivers, cut, through, the, range, particularly, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, range, as, a, result, the, main, ridge, of, the, himalayas, is, not, clearly, defined, and, mountain, passes, are, not, as, significant, for, traversing, the, range, as, with, other, mountain, ranges, himalayas, rivers, drain, into, two, large, systems, the, northern, slopes, of, gyala, peri, and, the, peaks, beyond, the, tsangpo, sometimes, included, in, the, himalayas, drain, into, the, irrawaddy, river, which, originates, in, eastern, tibet, and, flows, south, through, myanmar, to, drain, into, the, andaman, sea, the, salween, mekong, yangtze, and, yellow, river, all, originate, from, parts, of, the, tibetan, plateau, that, are, geologically, distinct, from, the, himalaya, mountains, and, are, therefore, not, considered, true, himalayan, rivers, some, geologists, refer, to, all, the, rivers, collectively, as, the, circum, himalayan, rivers, the, great, ranges, of, central, asia, including, the, himalayas, contain, the, third, largest, deposit, of, ice, and, snow, in, the, world, after, antarctica, and, the, arctic, some, even, refer, to, this, region, as, the, third, pole, the, himalayan, range, encompasses, about, 15, 000, glaciers, which, store, about, 12, 000, km, 3, 2, 900, cu, mi, or, 3600, 4400, gt, 10, 12, kg, of, fresh, water, its, glaciers, include, the, gangotri, and, yamunotri, uttarakhand, and, khumbu, glaciers, mount, everest, region, langtang, glacier, langtang, region, and, zemu, sikkim, owing, to, the, mountains, latitude, near, the, tropic, of, cancer, the, permanent, snow, line, is, among, the, highest, in, the, world, at, typically, around, 5, 500, m, 18, 000, ft, in, contrast, equatorial, mountains, in, new, guinea, the, rwenzoris, and, colombia, have, a, snow, line, some, 900, m, 2, 950, ft, lower, the, higher, regions, of, the, himalayas, are, snowbound, throughout, the, year, in, spite, of, their, proximity, to, the, tropics, and, they, form, the, sources, of, several, large, perennial, rivers, in, recent, years, scientists, have, monitored, a, notable, increase, in, the, rate, of, glacier, retreat, across, the, region, as, a, result, of, climate, change, for, example, glacial, lakes, have, been, forming, rapidly, on, the, surface, of, debris, covered, glaciers, in, the, bhutan, himalaya, during, the, last, few, decades, studies, have, measured, an, approximately, 13, overall, decrease, in, glacial, coverage, in, the, himalayas, over, the, last, 40, 50, years, local, conditions, play, a, large, role, in, glacial, retreat, however, and, glacial, loss, can, vary, locally, from, a, few, m, yr, to, 61, m, yr, a, marked, acceleration, in, glacial, mass, loss, has, also, been, observed, since, 1975, from, about, 5, 13, gt, yr, to, 16, 24, gt, yr, although, the, effect, of, this, will, not, be, known, for, many, years, it, potentially, could, mean, disaster, for, the, hundreds, of, millions, of, people, who, rely, on, the, glaciers, to, feed, the, rivers, during, the, dry, seasons, the, global, climate, change, will, affect, the, water, resources, and, livelihoods, of, the, greater, himalayan, region, the, himalayan, region, is, dotted, with, hundreds, of, lakes, pangong, tso, which, is, spread, across, the, border, between, india, and, china, at, the, far, western, end, of, tibet, is, among, the, largest, with, a, surface, area, of, 700, km, 2, 270, sq, mi, south, of, the, main, range, the, lakes, are, smaller, tilicho, lake, in, nepal, in, the, annapurna, massif, is, one, of, the, highest, lakes, in, the, world, other, lakes, include, rara, lake, in, western, nepal, she, phoksundo, lake, in, the, shey, phoksundo, national, park, of, nepal, gurudongmar, lake, in, north, sikkim, gokyo, lakes, in, solukhumbu, district, of, nepal, and, lake, tsongmo, near, the, indo, china, border, in, sikkim, some, of, the, lakes, present, the, danger, of, a, glacial, lake, outburst, flood, the, tsho, rolpa, glacier, lake, in, the, rowaling, valley, in, the, dolakha, district, of, nepal, is, rated, as, the, most, dangerous, the, lake, which, is, located, at, an, altitude, of, 4, 580, m, 15, 030, ft, has, grown, considerably, over, the, last, 50, years, due, to, glacial, melting, the, mountain, lakes, are, known, to, geographers, as, tarns, if, they, are, caused, by, glacial, activity, tarns, are, found, mostly, in, the, upper, reaches, of, the, himalaya, above, 5, 500, m, 18, 000, ft, temperate, himalayan, wetlands, provide, important, habitat, and, layover, sites, for, migratory, birds, many, mid, and, low, altitude, lakes, remain, poorly, studied, in, terms, of, their, hydrology, and, biodiversity, like, khecheopalri, in, the, sikkim, eastern, himalayas, the, physical, factors, determining, the, climate, in, any, location, in, the, himalayas, include, latitude, altitude, and, the, relative, motion, of, the, southwest, monsoon, from, north, to, south, the, mountains, cover, more, than, eight, degrees, of, latitude, spanning, temperate, to, subtropical, zones, the, colder, air, of, central, asia, is, prevented, from, blowing, down, into, south, asia, by, the, physical, configuration, of, the, himalayas, this, causes, the, tropical, zone, to, extend, farther, north, in, south, asia, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, the, evidence, is, unmistakable, in, the, brahmaputra, valley, as, the, warm, air, from, the, bay, of, bengal, bottlenecks, and, rushes, up, past, namcha, barwa, the, eastern, anchor, of, the, himalayas, and, into, southeastern, tibet, temperatures, in, the, himalayas, cool, by, 2, 0, degrees, c, 3, 6, degrees, f, for, every, 300, metres, 980, ft, increase, of, altitude, as, the, physical, features, of, mountains, are, irregular, with, broken, jagged, contours, there, can, be, wide, variations, in, temperature, over, short, distances, temperature, at, a, location, on, a, mountain, depends, on, the, season, of, the, year, the, bearing, of, the, sun, with, respect, to, the, face, on, which, the, location, lies, and, the, mass, of, the, mountain, i, e, the, amount, of, matter, in, the, mountain, as, the, temperature, is, directly, proportional, to, received, radiation, from, the, sun, the, faces, that, receive, more, direct, sunlight, also, have, a, greater, heat, buildup, in, narrow, valleys, lying, between, steep, mountain, faces, there, can, be, dramatically, different, weather, along, their, two, margins, the, side, to, the, north, with, a, mountain, above, facing, south, can, have, an, extra, month, of, the, growing, season, the, mass, of, the, mountain, also, influences, the, temperature, as, it, acts, as, a, heat, island, in, which, more, heat, is, absorbed, and, retained, than, the, surroundings, and, therefore, influences, the, heat, budget, or, the, amount, of, heat, needed, to, raise, the, temperature, from, the, winter, minimum, to, the, summer, maximum, the, immense, scale, of, the, himalayas, means, that, many, summits, can, create, their, own, weather, the, temperature, fluctuating, from, one, summit, to, another, from, one, face, to, another, and, all, may, be, quite, different, from, the, weather, in, nearby, plateaus, or, valleys, the, himalayan, hydroclimate, is, crucial, for, south, asia, where, annual, summer, monsoon, floods, impact, millions, a, critical, influence, on, the, himalayan, climate, is, the, southwest, monsoon, variability, in, monsoon, rainfall, influenced, by, local, hadley, circulation, and, tropical, sea, surface, temperatures, is, the, main, factor, behind, wet, and, dry, years, this, is, not, so, much, the, rain, of, the, summer, months, as, the, wind, that, carries, the, rain, different, rates, of, heating, and, cooling, between, the, central, asian, continent, and, the, indian, ocean, create, large, differences, in, the, atmospheric, pressure, prevailing, above, each, in, the, winter, a, high, pressure, system, forms, and, remains, suspended, above, central, asia, forcing, air, to, flow, in, the, southerly, direction, over, the, himalayas, but, in, central, asia, as, there, is, no, substantial, source, for, water, to, be, diffused, as, vapour, the, winter, winds, blowing, across, south, asia, are, dry, in, the, summer, months, the, central, asian, plateau, heats, up, more, than, the, ocean, waters, to, its, south, as, a, result, the, air, above, it, rises, higher, and, higher, creating, a, thermal, low, off, shore, high, pressure, systems, in, the, indian, ocean, push, the, moist, summer, air, inland, toward, the, low, pressure, system, when, the, moist, air, meets, mountains, it, rises, and, upon, subsequent, cooling, its, moisture, condenses, and, is, released, as, rain, typically, heavy, rain, the, wet, summer, monsoon, winds, cause, precipitation, in, india, and, all, along, the, layered, southern, slopes, of, the, himalayas, this, forced, lifting, of, air, is, called, the, orographic, effect, the, vast, size, huge, altitude, range, and, complex, topography, of, the, himalayas, mean, they, experience, a, wide, range, of, climates, from, humid, subtropical, in, the, foothills, to, cold, and, dry, desert, conditions, on, the, tibetan, side, of, the, range, for, much, of, the, himalayas, in, the, areas, to, the, south, of, the, high, mountains, the, monsoon, is, the, most, characteristic, feature, of, the, climate, and, causes, most, of, the, precipitation, while, the, western, disturbance, brings, winter, precipitation, especially, in, the, west, heavy, rain, arrives, on, the, southwest, monsoon, in, june, and, persists, until, september, the, monsoon, can, seriously, impact, transport, and, cause, major, landslides, it, restricts, tourism, the, trekking, and, mountaineering, season, is, limited, to, either, before, the, monsoon, in, april, may, or, after, the, monsoon, in, october, november, autumn, in, nepal, and, sikkim, there, are, often, considered, to, be, five, seasons, summer, monsoon, autumn, or, post, monsoon, winter, and, spring, using, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, the, lower, elevations, of, the, himalayas, reaching, in, mid, elevations, in, central, nepal, including, the, kathmandu, valley, are, classified, as, cwa, humid, subtropical, climate, with, dry, winters, higher, up, most, of, the, himalayas, have, a, subtropical, highland, climate, cwb, the, intensity, of, the, southwest, monsoon, diminishes, as, it, moves, westward, along, the, range, with, as, much, as, 2, 030, mm, 80, in, of, rainfall, in, the, monsoon, season, in, darjeeling, in, the, east, compared, to, only, 975, mm, 38, 4, in, during, the, same, period, in, shimla, in, the, west, the, northern, side, of, the, himalayas, also, known, as, the, tibetan, himalaya, is, dry, cold, and, generally, windswept, particularly, in, the, west, where, it, has, a, cold, desert, climate, the, vegetation, is, sparse, and, stunted, and, the, winters, are, severely, cold, most, of, the, precipitation, in, the, region, is, in, the, form, of, snow, during, the, late, winter, and, spring, months, local, impacts, on, climate, are, significant, throughout, the, himalayas, temperatures, fall, by, 0, 2, to, 1, 2, c, for, every, 100, m, 330, ft, rise, in, altitude, this, gives, rise, to, a, variety, of, climates, from, a, nearly, tropical, climate, in, the, foothills, to, tundra, and, permanent, snow, and, ice, at, higher, elevations, local, climate, is, also, affected, by, the, topography, the, leeward, side, of, the, mountains, receive, less, rain, while, the, well, exposed, slopes, get, heavy, rainfall, and, the, rain, shadow, of, large, mountains, can, be, significant, for, example, leading, to, near, desert, conditions, in, the, upper, mustang, which, is, sheltered, from, the, monsoon, rains, by, the, annapurna, and, dhaulagiri, massifs, and, has, annual, precipitation, of, around, 300, mm, 12, in, while, pokhara, on, the, southern, side, of, the, massifs, has, substantial, rainfall, 3, 900, mm, or, 150, in, a, year, thus, although, annual, precipitation, is, generally, higher, in, the, east, than, in, the, west, local, variations, are, often, more, important, the, himalayas, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, climate, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, tibetan, plateau, they, prevent, frigid, dry, winds, from, blowing, south, into, the, subcontinent, which, keeps, south, asia, much, warmer, than, corresponding, temperate, regions, in, the, other, continents, it, also, forms, a, barrier, for, the, monsoon, winds, keeping, them, from, traveling, northwards, and, causing, heavy, rainfall, in, the, terai, region, the, himalayas, are, also, believed, to, play, an, important, part, in, the, formation, of, central, asian, deserts, such, as, the, taklamakan, and, gobi, the, 2019, hindu, kush, himalaya, assessment, concluded, that, between, 1901, and, 2014, the, hindu, kush, himalaya, or, hkh, region, had, already, experienced, warming, of, 0, 1, c, per, decade, with, the, warming, rate, accelerating, to, 0, 2, c, per, decade, over, the, past, 50, years, over, the, past, 50, years, the, frequency, of, warm, days, and, nights, had, also, increased, by, 1, 2, days, and, 1, 7, nights, per, decade, while, the, frequency, of, extreme, warm, days, and, nights, had, increased, by, 1, 26, days, and, 2, 54, nights, per, decade, there, was, also, a, corresponding, decline, of, 0, 5, cold, days, 0, 85, extreme, cold, days, 1, cold, night, and, 2, 4, extreme, cold, nights, per, decade, the, length, of, the, growing, season, has, increased, by, 4, 25, days, per, decade, there, is, less, conclusive, evidence, of, light, precipitation, becoming, less, frequent, while, heavy, precipitation, became, both, more, frequent, and, more, intense, finally, since, 1970s, glaciers, have, retreated, everywhere, in, the, region, beside, karakoram, eastern, pamir, and, western, kunlun, where, there, has, been, an, unexpected, increase, in, snowfall, glacier, retreat, had, been, followed, by, an, increase, in, the, number, of, glacial, lakes, some, of, which, may, be, prone, to, dangerous, floods, in, the, future, if, the, paris, agreement, goal, of, 1, 5, c, of, global, warming, is, not, exceeded, warming, in, the, hkh, will, be, at, least, 0, 3, c, higher, and, at, least, 0, 7, c, higher, in, the, hotspots, of, northwest, himalaya, and, karakoram, if, the, paris, agreement, goals, are, broken, then, the, region, is, expected, to, warm, by, 1, 7, 2, 4, c, in, the, near, future, 2036, 2065, and, by, 2, 2, 3, 3, c, 2066, 2095, near, the, end, of, the, century, under, the, intermediate, representative, concentration, pathway, 4, 5, rcp4, 5, under, the, high, warming, rcp8, 5, scenario, where, the, annual, emissions, continue, to, increase, for, the, rest, of, the, century, the, expected, regional, warming, is, 2, 3, 3, 2, c, and, 4, 2, 6, 5, c, respectively, under, all, scenarios, winters, will, warm, more, than, the, summers, and, the, tibetan, plateau, the, central, himalayan, range, and, the, karakoram, will, continue, to, warm, more, than, the, rest, of, the, region, climate, change, will, also, lead, to, the, degradation, of, up, to, 81, of, the, region, s, permafrost, by, the, end, of, the, century, future, precipitation, is, projected, to, increase, as, well, but, cmip5, models, struggle, to, make, specific, projections, due, to, the, region, s, topography, the, most, certain, finding, is, that, the, monsoon, precipitation, in, the, region, will, increase, by, 4, 12, in, the, near, future, and, by, 4, 25, in, the, long, term, there, has, also, been, modelling, of, the, changes, in, snow, cover, but, it, is, limited, to, the, end, of, century, under, the, rcp, 8, 5, scenario, it, projects, declines, of, 30, 50, in, the, indus, basin, 50, 60, in, the, ganges, basin, and, 50, 70, in, the, brahmaputra, basin, as, the, snowline, elevation, in, these, regions, will, rise, by, between, 4, 4, and, 10, 0, m, yr, there, has, been, more, extensive, modelling, of, glacier, trends, it, is, projected, that, one, third, of, all, glaciers, in, the, extended, hkh, region, will, be, lost, by, 2100, even, if, the, warming, is, limited, to, 1, 5, c, with, over, half, of, that, loss, in, the, eastern, himalaya, region, while, rcp, 4, 5, and, rcp, 8, 5, are, likely, to, lead, to, the, losses, of, 50, and, 67, of, the, region, s, glaciers, over, the, same, timeframe, the, flora, and, fauna, of, the, himalayas, vary, with, climate, rainfall, altitude, and, soils, the, climate, ranges, from, tropical, at, the, base, of, the, mountains, to, permanent, ice, and, snow, at, the, highest, elevations, the, amount, of, yearly, rainfall, increases, from, west, to, east, along, the, southern, front, of, the, range, this, diversity, of, altitude, rainfall, and, soil, conditions, combined, with, the, very, high, snow, line, supports, a, variety, of, distinct, plant, and, animal, communities, the, extremes, of, high, altitude, low, atmospheric, pressure, combined, with, extreme, cold, favor, extremophile, organisms, at, high, altitudes, the, elusive, and, previously, endangered, snow, leopard, is, the, main, predator, its, prey, includes, members, of, the, goat, family, grazing, on, the, alpine, pastures, and, living, on, the, rocky, terrain, notably, the, endemic, bharal, or, himalayan, blue, sheep, the, himalayan, musk, deer, is, also, found, at, high, altitudes, hunted, for, its, musk, it, is, now, rare, and, endangered, other, endemic, or, near, endemic, herbivores, include, the, himalayan, tahr, the, takin, the, himalayan, serow, and, the, himalayan, goral, the, critically, endangered, himalayan, subspecies, of, the, brown, bear, is, found, sporadically, across, the, range, as, is, the, asian, black, bear, in, the, mountainous, mixed, deciduous, and, conifer, forests, of, the, eastern, himalayas, red, pandas, feed, in, the, dense, understories, of, bamboo, lower, down, the, forests, of, the, foothills, are, inhabited, by, several, different, primates, including, the, endangered, gee, s, golden, langur, and, the, kashmir, gray, langur, with, highly, restricted, ranges, in, the, east, and, west, of, the, himalayas, respectively, the, unique, floral, and, faunal, wealth, of, the, himalayas, is, undergoing, structural, and, compositional, changes, due, to, climate, change, hydrangea, hirta, is, an, example, of, floral, species, that, can, be, found, in, this, area, the, increase, in, temperature, is, shifting, various, species, to, higher, elevations, the, oak, forest, is, being, invaded, by, pine, forests, in, the, garhwal, himalayan, region, there, are, reports, of, early, flowering, and, fruiting, in, some, tree, species, especially, rhododendron, apple, and, box, myrtle, the, highest, known, tree, species, in, the, himalayas, is, juniperus, tibetica, located, at, 4, 900, m, 16, 080, ft, in, southeastern, tibet, similar, to, the, mountains, the, communities, living, near, the, himalayas, are, experiencing, climate, change, and, its, negative, impacts, significantly, more, than, other, parts, of, the, world, some, of, the, impacts, that, the, communities, are, facing, include, erratic, rainfall, flooding, rising, temperatures, and, landslides, these, impacts, can, have, extreme, negative, effects, on, the, villages, living, in, the, area, especially, as, the, temperatures, rise, at, higher, rates, than, many, other, places, in, the, world, alexander, et, al, 2014, there, are, more, than, 1, 9, million, people, who, are, highly, vulnerable, due, to, climate, change, with, an, additional, 10, million, people, at, risk, in, nepal, nepal, is, among, the, top, ten, most, vulnerable, global, south, countries, due, to, climate, change, in, the, world, standing, at, number, 4, as, of, 2010, according, to, the, climate, change, risk, atlas, according, to, napa, national, adaptation, program, of, action, of, nepal, many, threats, including, floods, droughts, and, landslides, are, an, imminent, threat, to, the, glacial, lake, area, with, this, in, consideration, climate, change, policy, and, framework, for, lapa, local, adaptation, plans, of, action, were, prepared, in, 2011, primarily, focusing, on, addressing, climatic, hazards, local, communities, are, suffering, from, food, scarcity, and, malnutrition, as, well, as, an, increasing, risk, to, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, dengue, fever, as, temperatures, rise, and, allow, these, diseases, to, migrate, further, north, there, is, also, an, increasing, risk, of, water, borne, illnesses, accompanied, by, an, increasing, lack, of, safe, drinking, water, illness, is, not, the, only, danger, to, the, communities, as, temperatures, sky, rocket, with, the, climate, changing, weather, patterns, are, also, changing, and, more, extreme, weather, events, are, occurring, putting, local, communities, more, at, risk, to, physical, harm, and, death, during, erratic, weather, events, marginalized, groups, including, children, and, women, are, experiencing, more, severe, impacts, from, climate, change, and, are, often, more, exposed, to, disease, and, injury, over, the, last, couple, years, these, health, impacts, have, gotten, increasingly, worse, and, more, common, recent, studies, have, shown, that, dengue, fever, has, had, a, consistent, pattern, of, epidemic, in, nepal, in, the, years, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022, with, the, largest, in, terms, of, severity, occurring, in, 2022, 54, 784, reported, cases, were, recorded, from, all, 77, districts, in, seven, provinces, these, diseases, are, simply, in, addition, to, other, diseases, that, can, be, seen, with, the, rise, of, global, temperatures, and, air, pollution, many, vulnerable, groups, are, experiencing, an, increase, in, respiratory, illness, cardiac, illnesses, and, asthma, the, heat, can, lead, to, issues, such, as, a, strain, on, respiratory, illnesses, heat, stroke, and, fever, there, is, also, the, increased, risk, of, cancer, many, lower, income, communities, such, as, the, himalayan, villages, suffer, from, exposure, to, more, pollution, or, in, some, cases, exposure, to, toxic, chemicals, which, has, led, to, an, increased, rate, of, cancer, in, these, communities, as, well, as, an, increased, risk, of, death, the, increasing, temperatures, are, also, leading, to, a, decrease, in, territory, for, local, wildlife, this, trend, has, decreased, the, prey, populations, of, at, risk, predators, such, as, snow, leopards, seeking, alternative, food, sources, snow, leopards, and, other, predators, attack, local, farmers, livestock, this, livestock, consists, of, yaks, oxen, horses, and, goats, snow, leopards, have, killed, about, 2, 6, of, the, local, livestock, per, year, in, response, to, their, shrinking, habitat, the, overall, loss, about, a, quarter, of, the, average, income, of, local, farmers, has, had, a, major, impact, on, the, local, economy, in, retaliation, farmers, have, begun, killing, snow, leopards, seeking, to, protect, their, livestock, and, their, livelihoods, nepal, is, a, part, of, the, paris, agreement, and, thus, is, required, to, have, a, climate, action, plan, and, is, being, tracked, by, the, climate, action, tracker, according, to, the, climate, action, tracker, nepal, is, almost, sufficient, on, its, track, to, reach, the, goals, set, by, the, paris, agreement, there, are, two, factors, that, hold, nepal, back, from, reaching, sufficient, status, and, thus, stand, out, there, is, no, climate, finance, plan, and, emissions, and, temperature, rising, rate, ranking, at, critically, insufficient, nepal, has, many, goals, however, that, are, on, track, with, the, paris, agreement, the, first, of, note, being, a, goal, of, net, zero, emissions, by, 2045, to, reach, this, goal, nepal, submitted, two, separate, plans, to, account, for, whatever, future, they, experience, the, first, being, wam, with, additional, measures, and, the, second, being, wem, with, existing, measures, wem, is, based, primarily, on, already, existing, policies, and, highlights, the, energy, sector, as, the, main, target, for, co2, reduction, the, wam, scenario, introduces, a, far, more, ambitious, strategy, for, reducing, emissions, in, this, scenario, the, focus, is, primarily, on, an, intervention, method, and, disruption, of, the, energy, sector, reducing, the, use, of, fossil, fuels, and, the, incorporation, of, renewable, energy, sources, this, pathway, heavily, relies, on, reducing, emissions, from, energy, sources, while, preserving, the, carbon, absorbing, capacity, of, the, lulucf, land, use, land, use, change, and, forestry, sector, under, this, scenario, it, is, anticipated, that, net, co2, emissions, will, remain, negative, from, 2020, to, 2030, approach, zero, between, 2035, and, 2045, and, then, revert, to, negative, values, by, 2050, the, goal, of, this, scenario, is, to, accelerate, the, journey, toward, achieving, carbon, neutrality, before, 2045, these, policies, along, with, many, more, have, nepal, on, track, to, stay, beneath, the, 1, 5, threshold, set, by, the, paris, agreement, in, recent, years, many, citizens, of, these, himalayan, communities, have, started, to, notice, the, extreme, effects, of, climate, change, by, experiencing, nature, itself, they, have, noticed, a, decrease, in, precipitation, especially, in, lowland, districts, fluctuating, temperatures, during, months, of, the, year, that, are, typically, cooler, and, changes, in, weather, patterns, even, compared, to, early, 2000s, weather, many, local, villagers, have, identified, climate, change, simply, through, the, availability, of, certain, native, plants, decreasing, or, shifting, seasons, the, concept, of, climate, change, has, now, been, aligned, with, the, risk, of, natural, disasters, and, has, increased, awareness, in, the, local, communities, these, impacts, of, climate, change, have, greatly, affected, agriculture, in, the, area, and, has, forced, farmers, to, change, crops, and, when, they, plant, them, in, response, to, this, rather, than, push, for, policy, change, citizens, have, begun, to, adapt, to, climate, change, according, to, dhungana, 91, 94, of, the, respondents, experienced, drought, as, major, climatic, hazards, then, floods, at, 83, 87, landslides, at, 70, 97, and, forest, fires, at, 67, 74, in, response, to, this, citizens, have, begun, adapting, and, adopting, new, practices, as, a, response, to, drought, at, the, high, altitudes, plantations, are, planting, more, protective, trees, drought, resistant, plants, and, have, begun, adopting, irrigation, practices, drawing, from, nearby, streams, in, response, to, flooding, farmers, have, created, more, basins, dam, construction, and, small, drainage, canals, the, response, to, landslides, includes, plantation, grasses, in, previously, barren, areas, gabion, wall, construction, avoiding, livestock, grazing, in, landslide, prone, areas, and, a, prohibition, on, tillage, in, areas, at, risk, of, landslides, to, fight, the, increased, rate, of, forest, fires, citizens, have, begun, beating, the, fires, with, green, branches, and, mud, construction, of, fire, lines, and, are, raising, awareness, about, the, wildfires, fire, lines, are, lines, of, varying, width, built, through, the, leaf, litter, of, a, forest, floor, down, to, the, soil, and, minerals, to, prevent, a, spread, of, fire, past, the, line, the, main, reason, for, these, adaptations, is, to, decrease, the, risk, that, climate, change, poses, over, these, marginalized, communities, while, taking, advantage, of, the, moment, and, allowing, for, a, positive, change, towards, a, more, sustainable, or, adaptable, future, major, barriers, to, these, adaptations, include, a, lack, of, funds, a, lack, of, knowledge, a, lack, of, technology, a, lack, of, time, and, lack, of, mandatory, policy, there, are, many, cultural, and, mythological, aspects, associated, with, the, himalayas, in, jainism, mount, ashtapada, of, the, himalayan, mountain, range, is, a, sacred, place, where, the, first, jain, tirthankara, rishabhanatha, attained, moksha, it, is, believed, that, after, rishabhanatha, attained, nirvana, his, son, bharata, had, constructed, three, stupas, and, twenty, four, shrines, of, the, 24, tirthankara, s, with, their, idols, studded, with, precious, stones, over, there, and, named, it, sinhnishdha, for, the, hindus, the, himalayas, are, personified, as, himavat, the, king, of, all, mountains, and, the, father, of, the, goddess, parvati, the, himalayas, are, also, considered, to, be, the, father, of, the, goddess, ganga, the, personification, of, river, ganges, two, of, the, most, sacred, places, of, pilgrimage, for, the, hindus, are, the, temple, complex, in, pashupatinath, and, muktinath, also, known, as, shaligrama, because, of, the, presence, of, the, sacred, black, rocks, called, shaligrams, the, buddhists, also, lay, a, great, deal, of, importance, on, the, himalayas, paro, taktsang, is, the, holy, place, where, buddhism, started, in, bhutan, the, muktinath, is, also, a, place, of, pilgrimage, for, the, tibetan, buddhists, they, believe, that, the, trees, in, the, poplar, grove, came, from, the, walking, sticks, of, eighty, four, ancient, indian, buddhist, magicians, or, mahasiddhas, they, consider, the, saligrams, to, be, representatives, of, the, tibetan, serpent, deity, known, as, gawo, jagpa, the, himalayan, people, s, diversity, shows, in, many, different, ways, it, shows, through, their, architecture, their, languages, and, dialects, their, beliefs, and, rituals, as, well, as, their, clothing, the, shapes, and, materials, of, the, people, s, homes, reflect, their, practical, needs, and, beliefs, another, example, of, the, diversity, amongst, the, himalayan, peoples, is, that, handwoven, textiles, display, colors, and, patterns, unique, to, their, ethnic, backgrounds, finally, some, people, place, great, importance, on, jewelry, the, rai, and, limbu, women, wear, big, gold, earrings, and, nose, rings, to, show, their, wealth, through, their, jewelry, several, places, in, the, himalayas, are, of, religious, significance, in, buddhism, jainism, sikhism, islam, and, hinduism, a, notable, example, of, a, religious, site, is, paro, taktsang, where, padmasambhava, is, said, to, have, founded, buddhism, in, bhutan, a, number, of, vajrayana, buddhist, sites, are, situated, in, the, himalayas, in, tibet, bhutan, and, in, the, indian, regions, of, ladakh, sikkim, arunachal, pradesh, spiti, and, darjeeling, there, were, over, 6, 000, monasteries, in, tibet, including, the, residence, of, the, dalai, lama, bhutan, sikkim, and, ladakh, are, also, dotted, with, numerous, monasteries, the, himalayas, are, home, to, a, diversity, of, medicinal, resources, plants, from, the, forests, have, been, used, for, millennia, to, treat, conditions, ranging, from, simple, coughs, to, snake, bites, different, parts, of, the, plants, root, flower, stem, leaves, and, bark, are, used, as, remedies, for, different, ailments, for, example, a, bark, extract, from, an, abies, pindrow, tree, is, used, to, treat, coughs, and, bronchitis, leaf, and, stem, paste, from, an, andrachne, cordifolia, is, used, for, wounds, and, as, an, antidote, for, snake, bites, the, bark, of, a, callicarpa, arborea, is, used, for, skin, ailments, nearly, a, fifth, of, the, gymnosperms, angiosperms, and, pteridophytes, in, the, himalayas, are, found, to, have, medicinal, properties, and, more, are, likely, to, be, discovered, most, of, the, population, in, some, asian, and, african, countries, depends, on, medicinal, plants, rather, than, prescriptions, and, such, since, so, many, people, use, medicinal, plants, as, their, only, source, of, healing, in, the, himalayas, the, plants, are, an, important, source, of, income, this, contributes, to, economic, and, modern, industrial, development, both, inside, and, outside, the, region, the, only, problem, is, that, locals, are, rapidly, clearing, the, forests, on, the, himalayas, for, wood, often, illegally
