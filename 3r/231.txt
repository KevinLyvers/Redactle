the, greenland, ice, sheet, is, an, ice, sheet, which, forms, the, second, largest, body, of, ice, in, the, world, it, is, an, average, of, 1, 67, km, 1, 0, mi, thick, and, over, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, thick, at, its, maximum, it, is, almost, 2, 900, kilometres, 1, 800, mi, long, in, a, north, south, direction, with, a, maximum, width, of, 1, 100, kilometres, 680, mi, at, a, latitude, of, 77, n, near, its, northern, edge, the, ice, sheet, covers, 1, 710, 000, square, kilometres, 660, 000, sq, mi, around, 80, of, the, surface, of, greenland, or, about, 12, of, the, area, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, the, term, greenland, ice, sheet, is, often, shortened, to, gis, or, gris, in, scientific, literature, greenland, has, had, major, glaciers, and, ice, caps, for, at, least, 18, million, years, but, a, single, ice, sheet, first, covered, most, of, the, island, some, 2, 6, million, years, ago, since, then, it, has, both, grown, and, contracted, significantly, the, oldest, known, ice, on, greenland, is, about, 1, million, years, old, due, to, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, ice, sheet, is, now, the, warmest, it, has, been, in, the, past, 1000, years, and, is, losing, ice, at, the, fastest, rate, in, at, least, the, past, 12, 000, years, every, summer, parts, of, the, surface, melt, and, ice, cliffs, calve, into, the, sea, normally, the, ice, sheet, would, be, replenished, by, winter, snowfall, but, due, to, global, warming, the, ice, sheet, is, melting, two, to, five, times, faster, than, before, 1850, and, snowfall, has, not, kept, up, since, 1996, if, the, paris, agreement, goal, of, staying, below, 2, c, 3, 6, f, is, achieved, melting, of, greenland, ice, alone, would, still, add, around, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, to, global, sea, level, rise, by, the, end, of, the, century, if, there, are, no, reductions, in, emissions, melting, would, add, around, 13, cm, 5, in, by, 2100, 1302, with, a, worst, case, of, about, 33, cm, 13, in, for, comparison, melting, has, so, far, contributed, 1, 4, cm, 1, 2, in, since, 1972, while, sea, level, rise, from, all, sources, was, 15, 25, cm, 6, 10, in, between, 1901, and, 2018, 5, if, all, 2, 900, 000, cubic, kilometres, 696, 000, cu, mi, of, the, ice, sheet, were, to, melt, it, would, increase, global, sea, levels, by, 7, 4, m, 24, ft, global, warming, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 2, 3, c, 4, 1, f, would, likely, make, this, melting, inevitable, however, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, would, still, cause, ice, loss, equivalent, to, 1, 4, m, 4, 1, 2, ft, of, sea, level, rise, and, more, ice, will, be, lost, if, the, temperatures, exceed, that, level, before, declining, if, global, temperatures, continue, to, rise, the, ice, sheet, will, likely, disappear, within, 10, 000, years, at, very, high, warming, its, future, lifetime, goes, down, to, around, 1, 000, years, ice, sheets, form, through, a, process, of, glaciation, when, the, local, climate, is, sufficiently, cold, that, snow, is, able, to, accumulate, from, year, to, year, as, the, annual, snow, layers, pile, up, their, weight, gradually, compresses, the, deeper, levels, of, snow, to, firn, and, then, to, solid, glacier, ice, over, hundreds, of, years, once, the, ice, sheet, formed, in, greenland, its, size, remained, similar, to, its, current, state, however, there, have, been, 11, periods, in, greenland, s, history, when, the, ice, sheet, extended, up, to, 120, km, 75, mi, beyond, its, current, boundaries, with, the, last, one, around, 1, million, years, ago, the, weight, of, the, ice, causes, it, to, slowly, flow, unless, it, is, stopped, by, a, sufficiently, large, obstacle, such, as, a, mountain, greenland, has, many, mountains, near, its, coastline, which, normally, prevent, the, ice, sheet, from, flowing, further, into, the, arctic, ocean, the, 11, previous, episodes, of, glaciation, are, notable, because, the, ice, sheet, grew, large, enough, to, flow, over, those, mountains, nowadays, the, northwest, and, southeast, margins, of, the, ice, sheet, are, the, main, areas, where, there, are, sufficient, gaps, in, the, mountains, to, enable, the, ice, sheet, to, flow, out, to, the, ocean, through, outlet, glaciers, these, glaciers, regularly, shed, ice, in, what, is, known, as, ice, calving, sediment, released, from, calved, and, melting, ice, sinks, accumulates, on, the, seafloor, and, sediment, cores, from, places, such, as, the, fram, strait, provide, long, records, of, glaciation, at, greenland, while, there, is, evidence, of, large, glaciers, in, greenland, for, most, of, the, past, 18, million, years, these, ice, bodies, were, probably, similar, to, various, smaller, modern, examples, such, as, maniitsoq, and, flade, isblink, which, cover, 76, 000, and, 100, 000, square, kilometres, 29, 000, and, 39, 000, sq, mi, around, the, periphery, conditions, in, greenland, were, not, initially, suitable, for, a, single, coherent, ice, sheet, to, develop, but, this, began, to, change, around, 10, million, years, ago, during, the, middle, miocene, when, the, two, passive, continental, margins, which, now, form, the, uplands, of, west, and, east, greenland, experienced, uplift, and, ultimately, formed, the, upper, planation, surface, at, a, height, of, 2000, to, 3000, meter, above, sea, level, later, uplift, during, the, pliocene, formed, a, lower, planation, surface, at, 500, to, 1000, meters, above, sea, level, a, third, stage, of, uplift, created, multiple, valleys, and, fjords, below, the, planation, surfaces, this, uplift, intensified, glaciation, due, to, increased, orographic, precipitation, and, cooler, surface, temperatures, allowing, ice, to, accumulate, and, persist, as, recently, as, 3, million, years, ago, during, the, pliocene, warm, period, greenland, s, ice, was, limited, to, the, highest, peaks, in, the, east, and, the, south, ice, cover, gradually, expanded, since, then, until, the, atmospheric, co2, levels, dropped, to, between, 280, and, 320, ppm, 2, 7, 2, 6, million, years, ago, by, which, time, temperatures, had, dropped, sufficiently, for, the, disparate, ice, caps, to, connect, and, cover, most, of, the, island, the, base, of, the, ice, sheet, may, be, warm, enough, due, to, geothermal, activity, to, have, liquid, water, beneath, it, this, liquid, water, under, pressure, from, the, weight, of, ice, above, it, may, cause, erosion, eventually, leaving, nothing, but, bedrock, below, the, ice, sheet, however, there, are, parts, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, near, the, summit, where, the, ice, sheet, slides, over, a, basal, layer, of, ice, which, had, frozen, solid, to, the, ground, preserving, ancient, soil, which, can, then, be, recovered, by, drilling, the, oldest, such, soil, was, continuously, covered, by, ice, for, around, 2, 7, million, years, while, another, 3, kilometres, 1, 9, mi, deep, ice, core, from, the, summit, has, revealed, ice, that, is, around, 1, 000, 000, years, old, sediment, samples, from, the, labrador, sea, provide, evidence, that, nearly, all, of, the, south, greenland, ice, had, melted, around, 400, 000, years, ago, during, marine, isotope, stage, 11, other, ice, core, samples, from, camp, century, in, northwestern, greenland, show, that, the, ice, there, melted, at, least, once, during, the, past, 1, 4, million, years, during, the, pleistocene, and, did, not, return, for, at, least, 280, 000, years, these, findings, suggest, that, less, than, 10, of, the, current, ice, sheet, volume, was, left, during, those, geologically, recent, periods, when, the, temperatures, were, less, than, 2, 5, c, 4, 5, f, warmer, than, preindustrial, conditions, this, contradicts, how, climate, models, typically, simulate, the, continuous, presence, of, solid, ice, under, those, conditions, analysis, of, the, 100, 000, year, records, obtained, from, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, long, ice, cores, drilled, between, 1989, and, 1993, into, the, summit, of, greenland, s, ice, sheet, had, provided, evidence, for, geologically, rapid, changes, in, climate, and, informed, research, on, tipping, points, such, as, in, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, ice, cores, provide, valuable, information, about, the, past, states, of, the, ice, sheet, and, other, kinds, of, paleoclimate, data, subtle, differences, in, the, oxygen, isotope, composition, of, the, water, molecules, in, ice, cores, can, reveal, important, information, about, the, water, cycle, at, the, time, while, air, bubbles, frozen, within, the, ice, core, provide, a, snapshot, of, the, gas, and, particulate, composition, of, the, atmosphere, through, time, when, properly, analyzed, ice, cores, provide, a, wealth, of, proxies, suitable, for, reconstructing, the, past, temperature, record, precipitation, patterns, volcanic, eruptions, solar, variation, ocean, primary, production, and, even, changes, in, soil, vegetation, cover, and, the, associated, wildfire, frequency, the, ice, cores, from, greenland, also, record, human, impact, such, as, lead, production, during, the, time, of, ancient, greece, and, the, roman, empire, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1980s, an, area, in, the, north, atlantic, which, included, southern, greenland, was, one, of, the, few, locations, in, the, world, which, showed, cooling, rather, than, warming, this, location, was, relatively, warmer, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, than, in, the, decades, immediately, before, or, after, more, complete, data, sets, have, established, trends, of, warming, and, ice, loss, starting, from, 1900, well, after, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, its, impact, on, global, carbon, dioxide, levels, and, a, trend, of, strong, warming, starting, around, 1979, in, line, with, concurrent, observed, arctic, sea, ice, decline, in, 1995, 1999, central, greenland, was, already, 2, c, 3, 6, f, warmer, than, it, was, in, the, 1950s, between, 1991, and, 2004, average, winter, temperature, at, one, location, swiss, camp, rose, almost, 6, c, 11, f, consistent, with, this, warming, the, 1970s, were, the, last, decade, when, the, greenland, ice, sheet, grew, gaining, about, 47, gigatonnes, per, year, from, 1980, 1990, there, was, an, average, annual, mass, loss, of, 51, gt, y, the, period, 1990, 2000, showed, an, average, annual, loss, of, 41, gt, y, with, 1996, being, the, last, year, the, greenland, ice, sheet, saw, net, mass, gain, as, of, 2022, the, greenland, ice, sheet, had, been, losing, ice, for, 26, years, in, a, row, and, temperatures, there, had, been, the, highest, in, the, entire, past, last, millennium, about, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, warmer, than, the, 20th, century, average, several, factors, determine, the, net, rate, of, ice, sheet, growth, or, decline, these, are, when, the, ipcc, third, assessment, report, was, published, in, 2001, the, analysis, of, observations, to, date, had, shown, that, the, ice, accumulation, of, 520, 26, gigatonnes, per, year, was, offset, by, runoff, and, bottom, melting, equivalent, to, ice, losses, of, 297, 32, gt, yr, and, 32, 3, gt, yr, and, iceberg, production, of, 235, 33, gt, yr, with, a, net, loss, of, 44, 53, gigatonnes, per, year, annual, ice, losses, from, the, greenland, ice, sheet, accelerated, in, the, 2000s, reaching, 187, gt, yr, in, 2000, 2010, and, an, average, mass, loss, during, 2010, 2018, of, 286, gt, per, year, half, of, the, ice, sheet, s, observed, net, loss, 3, 902, gigatons, gt, of, ice, between, 1992, and, 2018, or, approximately, 0, 13, of, its, total, mass, happened, during, those, 8, years, when, converted, to, sea, level, rise, equivalent, the, greenland, ice, sheet, contributed, about, 13, 7, mm, since, 1972, between, 2012, and, 2017, it, contributed, 0, 68, mm, per, year, compared, to, 0, 07, mm, per, year, between, 1992, and, 1997, greenland, s, net, contribution, for, the, 2012, 2016, period, was, equivalent, to, 37, of, sea, level, rise, from, land, ice, sources, excluding, thermal, expansion, these, melt, rates, are, comparable, to, the, largest, experienced, by, the, ice, sheet, over, the, past, 12, 000, years, currently, the, greenland, ice, sheet, loses, more, mass, every, year, than, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, because, of, its, position, in, the, arctic, where, it, is, subject, to, intense, regional, amplification, of, warming, ice, losses, from, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, have, been, accelerating, due, to, its, vulnerable, thwaites, and, pine, island, glaciers, and, the, antarctic, contribution, to, sea, level, rise, is, expected, to, overtake, that, of, greenland, later, this, century, retreat, of, outlet, glaciers, as, they, shed, ice, into, the, arctic, is, a, large, factor, in, the, decline, of, greenland, s, ice, sheet, estimates, suggest, that, losses, from, glaciers, explain, between, 49, and, 66, 8, of, observed, ice, loss, since, the, 1980s, net, loss, of, ice, was, already, observed, across, 70, of, the, ice, sheet, margins, by, the, 1990s, with, thinning, detected, as, the, glaciers, started, to, lose, height, between, 1998, and, 2006, thinning, occurred, four, times, faster, for, coastal, glaciers, compared, to, the, early, 1990s, falling, at, rates, between, 1, m, 3, 1, 2, ft, and, 10, m, 33, ft, per, year, while, the, landlocked, glaciers, experienced, almost, no, such, acceleration, one, of, the, most, dramatic, examples, of, thinning, was, in, the, southeast, at, kangerlussuaq, glacier, it, is, over, 20, mi, 32, km, long, 4, 5, mi, 7, km, wide, and, around, 1, km, 1, 2, mi, thick, which, makes, it, the, third, largest, glacier, in, greenland, between, 1993, and, 1998, parts, of, the, glacier, within, 5, km, 3, mi, of, the, coast, lost, 50, m, 164, ft, in, height, its, observed, ice, flow, speed, went, from, 3, 1, 3, 7, mi, 5, 6, km, per, year, in, 1988, 1995, to, 8, 7, mi, 14, km, per, year, in, 2005, which, was, then, the, fastest, known, flow, of, any, glacier, the, retreat, of, kangerlussuaq, slowed, down, by, 2008, and, showed, some, recovery, until, 2016, 2018, when, more, rapid, ice, loss, occurred, greenland, s, other, major, outlet, glaciers, have, also, experienced, rapid, change, in, recent, decades, its, single, largest, outlet, glacier, is, jakobshavn, isbr, greenlandic, sermeq, kujalleq, in, west, greenland, which, has, been, observed, by, glaciologists, for, many, decades, it, historically, sheds, ice, from, 6, 5, of, the, ice, sheet, compared, to, 4, for, kangerlussuaq, at, speeds, of, 20, metres, 66, ft, per, day, while, it, lost, enough, ice, to, retreat, around, 30, km, 19, mi, between, 1850, and, 1964, its, mass, gain, increased, sufficiently, to, keep, it, in, balance, for, the, next, 35, years, only, to, switch, to, rapid, mass, loss, after, 1997, by, 2003, the, average, annual, ice, flow, speed, had, almost, doubled, since, 1997, as, the, ice, tongue, in, front, of, the, glacier, disintegrated, and, the, glacier, shed, 94, square, kilometres, 36, sq, mi, of, ice, between, 2001, and, 2005, the, ice, flow, reached, 45, metres, 148, ft, per, day, in, 2012, but, slowed, down, substantially, afterwards, and, showed, mass, gain, between, 2016, and, 2019, northern, greenland, s, petermann, glacier, is, smaller, in, absolute, terms, but, experienced, some, of, the, most, rapid, degradation, in, recent, decades, it, lost, 85, square, kilometres, 33, sq, mi, of, floating, ice, in, 2000, 2001, followed, by, a, 28, square, kilometre, 11, sq, mi, iceberg, breaking, off, in, 2008, and, then, a, 260, square, kilometres, 100, sq, mi, iceberg, calving, from, ice, shelf, in, august, 2010, this, became, the, largest, arctic, iceberg, since, 1962, and, amounted, to, a, quarter, of, the, shelf, s, size, in, july, 2012, petermann, glacier, lost, another, major, iceberg, measuring, 120, square, kilometres, 46, sq, mi, or, twice, the, area, of, manhattan, as, of, 2023, the, glacier, s, ice, shelf, had, lost, around, 40, of, its, pre, 2010, state, and, it, is, considered, unlikely, to, recover, from, further, ice, loss, in, the, early, 2010s, some, estimates, suggested, that, tracking, the, largest, glaciers, would, be, sufficient, to, account, for, most, of, the, ice, loss, however, glacier, dynamics, can, be, hard, to, predict, as, shown, by, the, ice, sheet, s, second, largest, glacier, helheim, glacier, its, ice, loss, culminated, in, rapid, retreat, in, 2005, associated, with, a, marked, increase, in, glacial, earthquakes, between, 1993, and, 2005, since, then, it, has, remained, comparatively, stable, near, its, 2005, position, losing, relatively, little, mass, in, comparison, to, jakobshavn, and, kangerlussuaq, although, it, may, have, eroded, sufficiently, to, experience, another, rapid, retreat, in, the, near, future, meanwhile, smaller, glaciers, have, been, consistently, losing, mass, at, an, accelerating, rate, and, later, research, has, concluded, that, total, glacier, retreat, is, underestimated, unless, the, smaller, glaciers, are, accounted, for, by, 2023, the, rate, of, ice, loss, across, greenland, s, coasts, had, doubled, in, the, two, decades, since, 2000, in, large, part, due, to, the, accelerated, losses, from, smaller, glaciers, since, the, early, 2000s, glaciologists, have, concluded, that, glacier, retreat, in, greenland, is, accelerating, too, quickly, to, be, explained, by, a, linear, increase, in, melting, in, response, to, greater, surface, temperatures, alone, and, that, additional, mechanisms, must, also, be, at, work, rapid, calving, events, at, the, largest, glaciers, match, what, was, first, described, as, the, jakobshavn, effect, in, 1986, thinning, causes, the, glacier, to, be, more, buoyant, reducing, friction, that, would, otherwise, impede, its, retreat, and, resulting, in, a, force, imbalance, at, the, calving, front, with, an, increase, in, velocity, spread, across, the, mass, of, the, glacier, the, overall, acceleration, of, jakobshavn, isbrae, and, other, glaciers, from, 1997, onwards, had, been, attributed, to, the, warming, of, north, atlantic, waters, which, melt, the, glacier, fronts, from, underneath, while, this, warming, had, been, going, on, since, the, 1950s, 1997, also, saw, a, shift, in, circulation, which, brought, relatively, warmer, currents, from, the, irminger, sea, into, closer, contact, with, the, glaciers, of, west, greenland, by, 2016, waters, across, much, of, west, greenland, s, coastline, had, warmed, by, 1, 6, c, 2, 9, f, relative, to, 1990s, and, some, of, the, smaller, glaciers, were, losing, more, ice, to, such, melting, than, normal, calving, processes, leading, to, rapid, retreat, conversely, jakobshavn, isbrae, is, sensitive, to, changes, in, ocean, temperature, as, it, experiences, elevated, exposure, through, a, deep, subglacial, trench, this, sensitivity, meant, that, an, influx, of, cooler, ocean, water, to, its, location, was, responsible, for, its, slowdown, after, 2015, in, large, part, because, the, sea, ice, and, icebergs, immediately, off, shore, were, able, to, survive, for, longer, and, thus, helped, to, stabilize, the, glacier, likewise, the, rapid, retreat, and, then, slowdown, of, helheim, and, kangerdlugssuaq, has, also, been, connected, to, the, respective, warming, and, cooling, of, nearby, currents, at, petermann, glacier, the, rapid, rate, of, retreat, has, been, linked, to, the, topography, of, its, grounding, line, which, appears, to, shift, back, and, forth, by, around, a, kilometer, with, the, tide, it, has, been, suggested, that, if, similar, processes, can, occur, at, the, other, glaciers, then, their, eventual, rate, of, mass, loss, could, be, doubled, there, are, several, ways, in, which, increased, melting, at, the, surface, of, the, ice, sheet, can, accelerate, lateral, retreat, of, outlet, glaciers, firstly, the, increase, in, meltwater, at, the, surface, causes, larger, amounts, to, flow, through, the, ice, sheet, down, to, bedrock, via, moulins, there, it, lubricates, the, base, of, the, glaciers, and, generates, higher, basal, pressure, which, collectively, reduces, friction, and, accelerates, glacial, motion, including, the, rate, of, ice, calving, this, mechanism, was, observed, at, sermeq, kujalleq, in, 1998, and, 1999, where, flow, increased, by, up, to, 20, for, two, to, three, months, however, some, research, suggests, that, this, mechanism, only, applies, to, certain, small, glaciers, rather, than, to, the, largest, outlet, glaciers, and, may, have, only, a, marginal, impact, on, ice, loss, trends, secondly, once, meltwater, flows, into, the, ocean, it, can, still, impact, the, glaciers, by, interacting, with, ocean, water, and, altering, its, local, circulation, even, in, the, absence, of, any, ocean, warming, in, certain, fjords, large, meltwater, flows, from, beneath, the, ice, may, mix, with, ocean, water, to, create, turbulent, plumes, that, can, be, damaging, to, the, calving, front, while, the, models, generally, consider, the, impact, from, meltwater, run, off, as, secondary, to, ocean, warming, observations, of, 13, glaciers, found, that, meltwater, plumes, play, a, greater, role, for, glaciers, with, shallow, grounding, lines, further, 2022, research, suggests, that, the, warming, from, plumes, had, a, greater, impact, on, underwater, melting, across, northwest, greenland, finally, it, has, been, shown, that, meltwater, can, also, flow, through, cracks, that, are, too, small, to, be, picked, up, by, most, research, tools, only, 2, cm, 1, in, wide, such, cracks, do, not, connect, to, bedrock, through, the, entire, ice, sheet, but, may, still, reach, several, hundred, meters, down, from, the, surface, their, presence, is, important, as, it, weakens, the, ice, sheet, conducts, more, heat, directly, through, the, ice, and, allows, it, to, flow, faster, this, recent, research, is, not, currently, captured, in, models, one, of, the, scientists, behind, these, findings, alun, hubbard, described, finding, moulins, where, current, scientific, understanding, doesn, t, accommodate, their, presence, because, it, disregards, how, they, may, develop, from, hairline, cracks, in, the, absence, of, existing, large, crevasses, that, are, normally, thought, to, be, necessary, for, their, formation, currently, the, total, accumulation, of, ice, on, the, surface, of, greenland, ice, sheet, is, larger, than, either, outlet, glacier, losses, individually, or, surface, melting, during, the, summer, and, it, is, the, combination, of, both, which, causes, net, annual, loss, for, instance, the, ice, sheet, s, interior, thickened, by, an, average, of, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, each, year, between, 1994, and, 2005, in, part, due, to, a, phase, of, north, atlantic, oscillation, increasing, snowfall, every, summer, a, so, called, snow, line, separates, the, ice, sheet, s, surface, into, areas, above, it, where, snow, continues, to, accumulate, even, then, with, the, areas, below, the, line, where, summer, melting, occurs, the, exact, position, of, the, snow, line, moves, around, every, summer, and, if, it, moves, away, from, some, areas, it, covered, the, previous, year, then, those, tend, to, experience, substantially, greater, melt, as, their, darker, ice, is, exposed, uncertainty, about, the, snow, line, is, one, of, the, factors, making, it, hard, to, predict, each, melting, season, in, advance, a, notable, example, of, ice, accumulation, rates, above, the, snow, line, is, provided, by, glacier, girl, a, lockheed, p, 38, lightning, fighter, plane, which, had, crashed, early, in, world, war, ii, and, was, recovered, in, 1992, by, which, point, it, had, been, buried, under, 268, ft, 81, 1, 2, m, of, ice, another, example, occurred, in, 2017, when, an, airbus, a380, had, to, make, an, emergency, landing, in, canada, after, one, of, its, jet, engines, exploded, while, it, was, above, greenland, the, engine, s, massive, air, intake, fan, was, recovered, from, the, ice, sheet, two, years, later, when, it, was, already, buried, beneath, 4, ft, 1, m, of, ice, and, snow, while, summer, surface, melting, has, been, increasing, it, is, still, expected, that, it, will, be, decades, before, melting, will, consistently, exceed, snow, accumulation, on, its, own, it, is, also, hypothesized, that, the, increase, in, global, precipitation, associated, with, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, water, cycle, could, increase, snowfall, over, greenland, and, thus, further, delay, this, transition, this, hypothesis, was, difficult, to, test, in, the, 2000s, due, to, the, poor, state, of, long, term, precipitation, records, over, the, ice, sheet, by, 2019, it, was, found, that, while, there, was, an, increase, in, snowfall, over, southwest, greenland, there, had, been, a, substantial, decrease, in, precipitation, over, western, greenland, as, a, whole, further, more, precipitation, in, the, northwest, had, been, falling, as, rain, instead, of, snow, with, a, fourfold, increase, in, rain, since, 1980, rain, is, warmer, than, snow, and, forms, darker, and, less, thermally, insulating, ice, layer, once, it, does, freeze, on, the, ice, sheet, it, is, particularly, damaging, when, it, falls, due, to, late, summer, cyclones, whose, increasing, occurrence, has, been, overlooked, by, the, earlier, models, there, has, also, been, an, increase, in, water, vapor, which, paradoxically, increases, melting, by, making, it, easier, for, heat, to, radiate, downwards, through, moist, as, opposed, to, dry, air, altogether, the, melt, zone, below, the, snow, line, where, summer, warmth, turns, snow, and, ice, into, slush, and, melt, ponds, has, been, expanding, at, an, accelerating, rate, since, the, beginning, of, detailed, measurements, in, 1979, by, 2002, its, area, was, found, to, have, increased, by, 16, since, 1979, and, the, annual, melting, season, broke, all, previous, records, another, record, was, set, in, july, 2012, when, the, melt, zone, extended, to, 97, of, the, ice, sheet, s, cover, and, the, ice, sheet, lost, approximately, 0, 1, of, its, total, mass, 2900, gt, during, that, year, s, melting, season, with, the, net, loss, 464, gt, setting, another, record, it, became, the, first, directly, observed, example, of, a, massive, melting, event, when, the, melting, took, place, across, practically, the, entire, ice, sheet, surface, rather, than, specific, areas, that, event, led, to, the, counterintuitive, discovery, that, cloud, cover, which, normally, results, in, cooler, temperature, due, to, their, albedo, actually, interferes, with, meltwater, refreezing, in, the, firn, layer, at, night, which, can, increase, total, meltwater, runoff, by, over, 30, thin, water, rich, clouds, have, the, worst, impact, and, they, were, the, most, prominent, in, july, 2012, ice, cores, had, shown, that, the, last, time, a, melting, event, of, the, same, magnitude, as, in, 2012, took, place, was, in, 1889, and, some, glaciologists, had, expressed, hope, that, 2012, was, part, of, a, 150, year, cycle, this, was, disproven, in, summer, 2019, when, a, combination, of, high, temperatures, and, unsuitable, cloud, cover, led, to, an, even, larger, mass, melting, event, which, ultimately, covered, over, 300, 000, sq, mi, 776, 996, 4, km, 2, at, its, greatest, extent, predictably, 2019, set, a, new, record, of, 586, gt, net, mass, loss, in, july, 2021, another, record, mass, melting, event, occurred, at, its, peak, it, covered, 340, 000, sq, mi, 880, 596, 0, km, 2, and, led, to, daily, ice, losses, of, 88, gt, across, several, days, high, temperatures, continued, in, august, 2021, with, the, melt, extent, staying, at, 337, 000, sq, mi, 872, 826, 0, km, 2, at, that, time, rain, fell, for, 13, hours, at, greenland, s, summit, station, located, at, 10, 551, ft, 3, 215, 9, m, elevation, researchers, had, no, rain, gauges, to, measure, the, rainfall, because, temperatures, at, the, summit, have, risen, above, freezing, only, three, times, since, 1989, and, it, had, never, rained, there, before, due, to, the, enormous, thickness, of, the, central, greenland, ice, sheet, even, the, most, extensive, melting, event, can, only, affect, a, small, fraction, of, it, before, the, start, of, the, freezing, season, and, so, they, are, considered, short, term, variability, in, the, scientific, literature, nevertheless, their, existence, is, important, the, fact, that, the, current, models, underestimate, the, extent, and, frequency, of, such, events, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, the, observed, ice, sheet, decline, in, greenland, and, antarctica, tracks, the, worst, case, rather, than, the, moderate, scenarios, of, the, ipcc, fifth, assessment, report, s, sea, level, rise, projections, some, of, the, most, recent, scientific, projections, of, greenland, melt, now, include, an, extreme, scenario, where, a, massive, melting, event, occurs, every, year, across, the, studied, period, i, e, every, year, between, now, and, 2100, or, between, now, and, 2300, to, illustrate, that, such, a, hypothetical, future, would, greatly, increase, ice, loss, but, still, wouldn, t, melt, the, entire, ice, sheet, within, the, study, period, on, the, ice, sheet, annual, temperatures, are, generally, substantially, lower, than, elsewhere, in, greenland, about, 20, c, 4, f, at, the, south, dome, latitudes, 63, 65, n, and, 31, c, 24, f, near, the, center, of, the, north, dome, latitude, 72, n, the, fourth, highest, summit, of, greenland, on, 22, december, 1991, a, temperature, of, 69, 6, c, 93, 3, f, was, recorded, at, an, automatic, weather, station, near, the, topographic, summit, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, making, it, the, lowest, temperature, ever, recorded, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, record, went, unnoticed, for, more, than, 28, years, and, was, finally, recognized, in, 2020, these, low, temperatures, are, in, part, caused, by, the, high, albedo, of, the, ice, sheet, as, its, bright, white, surface, is, very, effective, at, reflecting, sunlight, ice, albedo, feedback, means, that, as, the, temperatures, increase, this, causes, more, ice, to, melt, and, either, reveal, bare, ground, or, even, just, to, form, darker, melt, ponds, both, of, which, act, to, reduce, albedo, which, accelerates, the, warming, and, contributes, to, further, melting, this, is, taken, into, account, by, the, climate, models, which, estimate, that, a, total, loss, of, the, ice, sheet, would, increase, global, temperature, by, 0, 13, c, 0, 23, f, while, greenland, s, local, temperatures, would, increase, by, between, 0, 5, c, 0, 90, f, and, 3, c, 5, 4, f, even, incomplete, melting, already, has, some, impact, on, the, ice, albedo, feedback, besides, the, formation, of, darker, melt, ponds, warmer, temperatures, enable, increasing, growth, of, algae, on, the, ice, sheet, s, surface, mats, of, algae, are, darker, in, colour, than, the, surface, of, the, ice, so, they, absorb, more, thermal, radiation, and, increase, the, rate, of, ice, melt, in, 2018, it, was, found, that, the, regions, covered, in, dust, soot, and, living, microbes, and, algae, altogether, grew, by, 12, between, 2000, and, 2012, in, 2020, it, was, demonstrated, that, the, presence, of, algae, which, is, not, accounted, for, by, ice, sheet, models, unlike, soot, and, dust, had, already, been, increasing, annual, melting, by, 10, 13, additionally, as, the, ice, sheet, slowly, gets, lower, due, to, melting, surface, temperatures, begin, to, increase, and, it, becomes, harder, for, snow, to, accumulate, and, turn, to, ice, in, what, is, known, as, surface, elevation, feedback, even, in, 1993, greenland, s, melt, resulted, in, 300, cubic, kilometers, of, fresh, meltwater, entering, the, seas, annually, which, was, substantially, larger, than, the, liquid, meltwater, input, from, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, and, equivalent, to, 0, 7, of, freshwater, entering, the, oceans, from, all, of, the, world, s, rivers, this, meltwater, is, not, pure, and, contains, a, range, of, elements, most, notably, iron, about, half, of, which, around, 0, 3, million, tons, every, year, is, bioavailable, as, a, nutrient, for, phytoplankton, thus, meltwater, from, greenland, enhances, ocean, primary, production, both, in, the, local, fjords, and, further, out, in, the, labrador, sea, where, 40, of, the, total, primary, production, had, been, attributed, to, nutrients, from, meltwater, since, the, 1950s, the, acceleration, of, greenland, melt, caused, by, climate, change, has, already, been, increasing, productivity, in, waters, off, the, north, icelandic, shelf, while, productivity, in, greenland, s, fjords, is, also, higher, than, it, had, been, at, any, point, in, the, historical, record, which, spans, from, late, 19th, century, to, present, some, research, suggests, that, greenland, s, meltwater, mainly, benefits, marine, productivity, not, by, adding, carbon, and, iron, but, through, stirring, up, lower, water, layers, that, are, rich, in, nitrates, and, thus, bringing, more, of, those, nutrients, to, phytoplankton, on, the, surface, as, the, outlet, glaciers, retreat, inland, the, meltwater, will, be, less, able, to, impact, the, lower, layers, which, implies, that, benefit, from, the, meltwater, will, diminish, even, as, its, volume, grows, the, impact, of, meltwater, from, greenland, goes, beyond, nutrient, transport, for, instance, meltwater, also, contains, dissolved, organic, carbon, which, comes, from, the, microbial, activity, on, the, ice, sheet, s, surface, and, to, a, lesser, extent, from, the, remnants, of, ancient, soil, and, vegetation, beneath, the, ice, there, is, about, 0, 5, 27, billion, tonnes, of, pure, carbon, underneath, the, entire, ice, sheet, and, much, less, within, it, this, is, much, less, than, the, 1400, 1650, billion, tonnes, contained, within, the, arctic, permafrost, or, the, annual, anthropogenic, emissions, of, around, 40, billion, tonnes, of, co, 2, 1237, yet, the, release, of, this, carbon, through, meltwater, can, still, act, as, a, climate, change, feedback, if, it, increases, overall, carbon, dioxide, emissions, there, is, one, known, area, at, russell, glacier, where, meltwater, carbon, is, released, into, the, atmosphere, in, the, form, of, methane, see, arctic, methane, emissions, which, has, a, much, larger, global, warming, potential, than, carbon, dioxide, however, the, area, also, harbours, large, numbers, of, methanotrophic, bacteria, which, limit, those, methane, emissions, in, 2021, research, claimed, that, there, must, be, mineral, deposits, of, mercury, a, highly, toxic, heavy, metal, beneath, the, southwestern, ice, sheet, because, of, the, exceptional, concentrations, in, meltwater, entering, the, local, fjords, if, confirmed, these, concentrations, would, have, equalled, up, to, 10, of, mercury, in, all, of, the, world, s, rivers, in, 2024, a, follow, up, study, found, only, very, low, concentrations, in, meltwater, from, 21, locations, it, concluded, that, the, 2021, findings, were, best, explained, by, accidental, sample, contamination, with, mercury, ii, chloride, used, by, the, first, team, of, researchers, as, a, reagent, however, there, is, still, a, risk, of, toxic, waste, being, released, from, camp, century, formerly, a, united, states, military, site, built, to, carry, nuclear, weapons, for, the, project, iceworm, the, project, was, cancelled, but, the, site, was, never, cleaned, up, and, it, now, threatens, to, pollute, the, meltwater, with, nuclear, waste, 20, 000, liters, of, chemical, waste, and, 24, million, liters, of, untreated, sewage, as, the, melt, progresses, finally, increased, quantities, of, fresh, meltwater, can, affect, ocean, circulation, some, scientists, have, connected, this, increased, discharge, from, greenland, with, the, so, called, cold, blob, in, the, north, atlantic, which, is, in, turn, connected, to, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, or, amoc, and, its, apparent, slowdown, in, 2016, a, study, attempted, to, improve, forecasts, of, future, amoc, changes, by, incorporating, better, simulation, of, greenland, trends, into, projections, from, eight, state, of, the, art, climate, models, that, research, found, that, by, 2090, 2100, the, amoc, would, weaken, by, around, 18, with, a, range, of, potential, weakening, between, 3, and, 34, under, representative, concentration, pathway, 4, 5, which, is, most, akin, to, the, current, trajectory, while, it, would, weaken, by, 37, with, a, range, between, 15, and, 65, under, representative, concentration, pathway, 8, 5, which, assumes, continually, increasing, emissions, if, the, two, scenarios, are, extended, past, 2100, then, the, amoc, ultimately, stabilizes, under, rcp, 4, 5, but, it, continues, to, decline, under, rcp, 8, 5, the, average, decline, by, 2290, 2300, is, 74, and, there, is, 44, likelihood, of, an, outright, collapse, in, that, scenario, with, a, wide, range, of, adverse, effects, in, 2021, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, estimated, that, under, ssp5, 8, 5, the, scenario, associated, with, the, highest, global, warming, greenland, ice, sheet, melt, would, add, around, 13, cm, 5, in, to, the, global, sea, levels, with, a, likely, 17, 83, range, of, 9, 18, cm, 3, 1, 2, 7, in, and, a, very, likely, range, 5, 95, confidence, level, of, 5, 23, cm, 2, 9, in, while, the, moderate, ssp2, 4, 5, scenario, adds, 8, cm, 3, in, with, a, likely, and, very, likely, range, of, 4, 13, cm, 1, 1, 2, 5, in, and, 1, 18, cm, 1, 2, 7, in, respectively, the, optimistic, scenario, which, assumes, that, the, paris, agreement, goals, are, largely, fulfilled, ssp1, 2, 6, adds, around, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, and, no, more, than, 15, cm, 6, in, with, a, small, chance, of, the, ice, sheet, gaining, mass, and, thus, reducing, the, sea, levels, by, around, 2, cm, 1, in, 1260, some, scientists, led, by, james, hansen, have, claimed, that, the, ice, sheets, can, disintegrate, substantially, faster, than, estimated, by, the, ice, sheet, models, but, even, their, projections, also, have, much, of, greenland, whose, total, size, amounts, to, 7, 4, m, 24, ft, of, sea, level, rise, survive, the, 21st, century, a, 2016, paper, from, hansen, claimed, that, greenland, ice, loss, could, add, around, 33, cm, 13, in, by, 2060, in, addition, to, double, that, figure, from, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, if, the, co, 2, concentration, exceeded, 600, parts, per, million, which, was, immediately, controversial, amongst, the, scientific, community, while, 2019, research, from, different, scientists, claimed, a, maximum, of, 33, cm, 13, in, by, 2100, under, the, worst, case, climate, change, scenario, as, with, the, present, losses, not, all, parts, of, the, ice, sheet, would, contribute, to, them, equally, for, instance, it, is, estimated, that, on, its, own, the, northeast, greenland, ice, stream, would, contribute, 1, 3, 1, 5, cm, by, 2100, under, rcp, 4, 5, and, rcp, 8, 5, respectively, on, the, other, hand, the, three, largest, glaciers, jakobshavn, helheim, and, kangerlussuaq, are, all, located, in, the, southern, half, of, the, ice, sheet, and, just, the, three, of, them, are, expected, to, add, 9, 1, 14, 9, mm, under, rcp, 8, 5, similarly, 2013, estimates, suggested, that, by, 2200, they, and, another, large, glacier, would, add, 29, to, 49, millimetres, by, 2200, under, rcp, 8, 5, or, 19, to, 30, millimetres, under, rcp, 4, 5, altogether, the, single, largest, contribution, to, 21st, century, ice, loss, in, greenland, is, expected, to, be, from, the, northwest, and, central, west, streams, the, latter, including, jakobshavn, and, glacier, retreat, will, be, responsible, for, at, least, half, of, the, total, ice, loss, as, opposed, to, earlier, studies, which, suggested, that, surface, melting, would, become, dominant, later, this, century, if, greenland, were, to, lose, all, of, its, coastal, glaciers, though, then, whether, or, not, it, will, continue, to, shrink, will, be, entirely, determined, by, whether, its, surface, melting, in, the, summer, consistently, outweighs, ice, accumulation, during, winter, under, the, highest, emission, scenario, this, could, happen, around, 2055, well, before, the, coastal, glaciers, are, lost, sea, level, rise, from, greenland, does, not, affect, every, coast, equally, the, south, of, the, ice, sheet, is, much, more, vulnerable, than, the, other, parts, and, the, quantities, of, ice, involved, mean, that, there, is, an, impact, on, the, deformation, of, earth, s, crust, and, on, earth, s, rotation, while, this, effect, is, subtle, it, already, causes, east, coast, of, the, united, states, to, experience, faster, sea, level, rise, than, the, global, average, at, the, same, time, greenland, itself, would, experience, isostatic, rebound, as, its, ice, sheet, shrinks, and, its, ground, pressure, becomes, lighter, similarly, a, reduced, mass, of, ice, would, exert, a, lower, gravitational, pull, on, the, coastal, waters, relative, to, the, other, land, masses, these, two, processes, would, cause, sea, level, around, greenland, s, own, coasts, to, fall, even, as, it, rises, elsewhere, the, opposite, of, this, phenomenon, happened, when, the, ice, sheet, gained, mass, during, the, little, ice, age, increased, weight, attracted, more, water, and, flooded, certain, viking, settlements, likely, playing, a, large, role, in, the, viking, abandonment, soon, afterwards, notably, the, ice, sheet, s, massive, size, simultaneously, makes, it, insensitive, to, temperature, changes, in, the, short, run, yet, also, commits, it, to, enormous, changes, down, the, line, as, demonstrated, by, paleoclimate, evidence, polar, amplification, causes, the, arctic, including, greenland, to, warm, three, to, four, times, more, than, the, global, average, thus, while, a, period, like, the, eemian, interglacial, 130, 000, 115, 000, years, ago, was, not, much, warmer, than, today, globally, the, ice, sheet, was, 8, c, 14, f, warmer, and, its, northwest, part, was, 130, 300, meters, lower, than, it, is, at, present, some, estimates, suggest, that, the, most, vulnerable, and, fastest, receding, parts, of, the, ice, sheet, have, already, passed, a, point, of, no, return, around, 1997, and, will, be, committed, to, disappearance, even, if, the, temperature, stops, rising, a, 2022, paper, found, that, the, 2000, 2019, climate, would, already, result, in, the, loss, of, 3, 3, volume, of, the, entire, ice, sheet, in, the, future, committing, it, to, an, eventual, 27, cm, 10, 1, 2, in, of, slr, independent, of, any, future, temperature, change, they, have, additionally, estimated, that, if, the, then, record, melting, seen, on, the, ice, sheet, in, 2012, were, to, become, its, new, normal, then, the, ice, sheet, would, be, committed, to, around, 78, cm, 30, 1, 2, in, slr, another, paper, suggested, that, paleoclimate, evidence, from, 400, 000, years, ago, is, consistent, with, ice, losses, from, greenland, equivalent, to, at, least, 1, 4, m, 4, 1, 2, ft, of, sea, level, rise, in, a, climate, with, temperatures, close, to, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, which, are, now, inevitable, at, least, in, the, near, future, it, is, also, known, that, at, a, certain, level, of, global, warming, effectively, the, entirety, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, will, eventually, melt, its, volume, was, initially, estimated, to, amount, to, 2, 850, 000, km, 3, 684, 000, cu, mi, which, would, increase, the, global, sea, levels, by, 7, 2, m, 24, ft, but, later, estimates, increased, its, size, to, 2, 900, 000, km, 3, 696, 000, cu, mi, leading, to, 7, 4, m, 24, ft, of, sea, level, rise, in, 2006, it, was, estimated, that, the, ice, sheet, is, most, likely, to, be, committed, to, disappearance, at, 3, 1, c, 5, 6, f, with, a, plausible, range, between, 1, 9, c, 3, 4, f, and, 5, 1, c, 9, 2, f, however, these, estimates, were, drastically, reduced, in, 2012, with, the, suggestion, that, the, threshold, may, lie, anywhere, between, 0, 8, c, 1, 4, f, and, 3, 2, c, 5, 8, f, with, 1, 6, c, 2, 9, f, the, most, plausible, global, temperature, for, the, ice, sheet, s, disappearance, that, lowered, temperature, range, had, been, widely, used, in, the, subsequent, literature, and, in, the, year, 2015, prominent, nasa, glaciologist, eric, rignot, claimed, that, even, the, most, conservative, people, in, our, community, will, agree, that, greenland, s, ice, is, gone, after, 2, c, 3, 6, f, or, 3, c, 5, 4, f, of, global, warming, in, 2022, a, major, review, of, scientific, literature, on, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, barely, modified, these, values, it, suggested, that, the, threshold, would, be, most, likely, be, at, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, with, the, upper, level, at, 3, c, 5, 4, f, and, the, worst, case, threshold, of, 0, 8, c, 1, 4, f, remained, unchanged, at, the, same, time, it, noted, that, the, fastest, plausible, timeline, for, the, ice, sheet, disintegration, is, 1000, years, which, is, based, on, research, assuming, the, worst, case, scenario, of, global, temperatures, exceeding, 10, c, 18, f, by, 2500, while, its, ice, loss, otherwise, takes, place, over, around, 10, 000, years, after, the, threshold, is, crossed, the, longest, possible, estimate, is, 15, 000, years, model, based, projections, published, in, the, year, 2023, had, indicated, that, the, greenland, ice, sheet, could, be, a, little, more, stable, than, suggested, by, the, earlier, estimates, one, paper, found, that, the, threshold, for, ice, sheet, disintegration, is, more, likely, to, lie, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 2, 3, c, 4, 1, f, it, also, indicated, that, the, ice, sheet, could, still, be, saved, and, its, sustained, collapse, averted, if, the, warming, were, reduced, to, below, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, up, to, a, few, centuries, after, the, threshold, was, first, breached, however, while, that, would, avert, the, loss, of, the, entire, ice, sheet, it, would, increase, the, overall, sea, level, rise, by, up, to, several, meters, as, opposed, to, a, scenario, where, the, warming, threshold, was, not, breached, in, the, first, place, another, paper, using, a, more, complex, ice, sheet, model, has, found, that, since, the, warming, passed, 0, 6, c, 1, 1, f, degrees, 26, cm, 10, in, of, sea, level, rise, became, inevitable, closely, matching, the, estimate, derived, from, direct, observation, in, 2022, however, it, had, also, found, that, 1, 6, c, 2, 9, f, would, likely, only, commit, the, ice, sheet, to, 2, 4, m, 8, ft, of, long, term, sea, level, rise, while, near, complete, melting, of, 6, 9, m, 23, ft, worth, of, sea, level, rise, would, occur, if, the, temperatures, consistently, stay, above, 2, c, 3, 6, f, the, paper, also, suggested, that, ice, losses, from, greenland, may, be, reversed, by, reducing, temperature, to, 0, 6, c, 1, 1, f, or, lower, up, until, the, entirety, of, south, greenland, ice, melts, which, would, cause, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, of, sea, level, rise, and, prevent, any, regrowth, unless, co, 2, concentrations, is, reduced, to, 300, ppm, if, the, entire, ice, sheet, were, to, melt, it, would, not, begin, to, regrow, until, temperatures, fall, to, below, the, preindustrial, levels
