socio, economic, inconsistencies, within, the, region, the, entry, into, the, slave, trade, brought, even, more, tension, within, bordeaux, society, the, trade, exacerbated, the, divide, between, an, elite, with, growing, wealth, and, those, living, in, poverty, this, economic, divide, laid, out, the, foundation, for, the, mass, unrest, that, would, break, out, in, the, french, revolution, three,
