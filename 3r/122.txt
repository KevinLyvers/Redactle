before, declining, again, amidst, a, regional, cooling, and, drying, trend, until, 1, 400, years, ago, when, they, were, less, than, 10, metres, lower, than, average, modern, levels, they, then, began, to, rise, once, more, until, reaching, their, present, level, the, lake, often, remains, frozen, for, three, months, continuously, in, winter, during, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce,

of, 10, centimeters, 3, 9, in, which, was, reversed, at, a, rate, of, 10, cm, year, 3, 9, in, year, between, 1983, and, 1989, but, has, continued, to, drop, since, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, reported, in, 1998, the, lake, was, again, threatened, with, loss, of, surface, area, due, to, livestock, over, grazing, land, reclamations, and, natural, causes, surface, area, decreased, 11, 7, in, the, period, from, 1908, to, 2000, during, that, period, higher, lake, floor, areas, were, exposed, and, numerous, water, bodies, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, main, lake, in, the, 1960s, the,

into, half, a, dozen, more, small, lakes, at, the, border, qinghai, provincial, remote, sensing, center, attributed, the, separation, of, qinghai, lake, to, shrinkage, of, the, water, surface, as, a, result, of, a, lowered, water, level, and, desertification, in, the, region, the, water, surface, has, shrunk, by, 312, km, 2, 120, sq, mi, over, the, last, three, decades, the, lake, is, located, at, the, crossroads, of, several, bird, migration, routes, across, asia, many, species, use, qinghai, as, an, intermediate, stop, during, migration, as, such, it, is, a, focal, point, in, global, concerns, regarding, avian, influenza, h5n1, as, a, major, outbreak, here, could, spread, the, virus, across, europe, and, asia, further, increasing, the, chances, of, a, pandemic, minor, outbreaks, of, h5n1, have, already, been, identified, at, the, lake, the, bird, islands, have, been, sanctuaries, of, the, qinghai, lake, natural, protection, zone, since, 1997, there, are, five, native, fish, species, the, edible, naked, carp, gymnocypris, przewalskii, hu, ngy, which, is, the, most, abundant, in, the, lake, and, four, stoneloaches, triplophysa, stolickai, t, dorsonotata, t, scleroptera, and, t, siluroides, other, yellow, river, fish, species, occurred, in, the, lake, but, they, disappeared, with, the, increasing, salinity, and, basicity, beginning, in, the, early, holocene, there, is, an, island, in, the, western, part, of, the, lake, with, a, temple, and, a, few, hermitages, called, mah, deva, the, heart, of, the, lake, mtsho, snying, ma, h, de, wa, in, tibetan, which,

to, and, from, only, when, the, lake, froze, over, in, winter, a, nomad, described, the, size, of, the, island, by, saying, that, if, in, the, morning, a, she, goat, starts, to, browse, the, grass, around, it, clockwise, and, its, kid, anti, clockwise, they, will, meet, only, in, the, night, which, shows, how, big, the, island, is, it, is, also, known, as, the, place, to, which, gushri, khan, and, other, khoshut, mongols, migrated, during, the, 1620s, the, lake, is, currently, circumnavigated, by, pilgrims, mainly, tibetan, buddhists, especially, every, horse, year, of, the, 12, year, cycle, nikolay, przhevalsky, estimated, it, would, take, about, eight, days, by, horse, or, 15, walking, to, circumambulate, the, lake, but, pilgrims, report, it, takes, about, 18, days, on, horseback, and, one, took, 23, days, walking, to, complete, the, circuit
