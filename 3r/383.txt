krakatoa, k, r, k, t, o, k, r, k, also, transcribed, krakatau, t, a, is, a, caldera, in, the, sunda, strait, between, the, islands, of, java, and, sumatra, in, the, indonesian, province, of, lampung, the, caldera, is, part, of, a, volcanic, island, group, krakatoa, archipelago, comprising, four, islands, two, of, them, are, known, as, lang, and, verlaten, another, rakata, is, the, only, remnant, of, an, island, mostly, destroyed, by, an, eruption, in, 1883, which, created, the, caldera, in, 1927, a, fourth, island, anak, krakatoa, or, child, of, krakatoa, emerged, from, the, caldera, formed, in, 1883, there, has, been, new, eruptive, activity, since, the, late, 20th, century, with, a, large, collapse, causing, a, deadly, tsunami, in, december, 2018, the, most, notable, eruptions, of, krakatoa, culminated, in, a, series, of, massive, explosions, over, 26, 27, august, 1883, which, were, among, the, most, violent, volcanic, events, in, recorded, history, with, an, estimated, volcanic, explosivity, index, vei, of, 6, the, eruption, was, equivalent, to, 200, megatons, of, tnt, 840, pj, about, 13, 000, times, the, nuclear, yield, of, the, little, boy, bomb, 13, to, 16, kt, that, devastated, hiroshima, japan, during, world, war, ii, and, four, times, the, yield, of, tsar, bomba, the, most, powerful, nuclear, device, ever, detonated, at, 50, mt, the, 1883, eruption, ejected, approximately, 25, km, 3, 6, cubic, miles, of, rock, the, cataclysmic, explosion, was, heard, 3, 600, km, 2, 200, mi, away, in, alice, springs, australia, and, on, the, island, of, rodrigues, near, mauritius, 4, 780, km, 2, 970, mi, to, the, west, according, to, the, official, records, of, the, dutch, east, indies, colony, 165, villages, and, towns, were, destroyed, near, krakatoa, and, 132, were, seriously, damaged, at, least, 36, 417, people, died, and, many, more, thousands, were, injured, mostly, from, the, tsunamis, that, followed, the, explosion, the, eruption, destroyed, two, thirds, of, the, island, of, krakatoa, eruptions, in, the, area, since, 1927, have, built, a, new, island, at, the, same, location, named, anak, krakatau, which, is, indonesian, for, child, of, krakatoa, periodic, eruptions, have, continued, since, with, recent, eruptions, in, 2009, 2010, 2011, and, 2012, and, a, major, collapse, in, 2018, in, late, 2011, this, island, had, a, radius, of, roughly, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, and, a, highest, point, of, about, 324, metres, 1, 063, ft, above, sea, level, growing, five, metres, 16, ft, each, year, in, 2017, the, height, of, anak, krakatau, was, reported, as, over, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, above, sea, level, following, a, collapse, in, december, 2018, the, height, was, reduced, to, 110, meters, 361, ft, one, of, the, earliest, mentions, of, the, name, krakatoa, is, in, the, old, sundanese, text, bujangga, manik, which, was, probably, written, in, western, java, in, the, late, 15th, century, here, krakatoa, is, referred, to, as, the, island, of, rakata, a, mountain, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, pulo, rakata, gunung, ti, tengah, sagara, f, 27v, although, there, are, earlier, descriptions, in, european, sources, of, an, island, in, the, sunda, strait, with, a, pointed, mountain, the, earliest, mention, of, krakatoa, by, name, in, the, western, world, was, on, a, 1611, map, by, lucas, janszoon, waghenaer, who, labelled, the, island, pulo, carcata, pulo, is, the, sundanese, word, for, island, about, two, dozen, variants, have, been, found, including, crackatouw, cracatoa, and, krakatao, in, an, older, portuguese, based, spelling, the, first, known, appearance, of, the, spelling, krakatau, was, by, wouter, schouten, who, passed, by, the, high, tree, covered, island, of, krakatau, in, october, 1658, the, origin, of, the, indonesian, name, krakatau, is, uncertain, the, main, theories, are, the, smithsonian, institution, s, global, volcanism, program, cites, the, indonesian, name, krakatau, as, the, correct, name, but, says, that, krakatoa, is, often, employed, indonesia, has, over, 130, active, volcanoes, the, most, of, any, nation, they, make, up, the, axis, of, the, indonesian, island, arc, system, produced, by, northeastward, subduction, of, the, indo, australian, plate, a, majority, of, these, volcanoes, lie, along, indonesia, s, two, largest, islands, java, and, sumatra, these, two, islands, are, separated, by, the, sunda, strait, located, at, a, bend, in, the, axis, of, the, island, arc, krakatau, is, directly, above, the, subduction, zone, of, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, indo, australian, plate, where, the, plate, boundaries, make, a, sharp, change, of, direction, possibly, resulting, in, an, unusually, weak, crust, in, the, region, at, some, point, in, prehistory, an, earlier, caldera, forming, eruption, had, occurred, leaving, as, remnants, verlaten, or, sertung, lang, also, known, as, rakata, kecil, or, panjang, poolsche, hoed, polish, hat, and, the, base, of, rakata, later, at, least, two, more, cones, perboewatan, and, danan, formed, and, eventually, joined, with, rakata, forming, the, main, island, of, krakatoa, at, the, time, of, the, 1883, eruption, the, krakatoa, group, comprised, lang, verlaten, and, krakatoa, itself, an, island, 9, km, 5, 6, mi, long, by, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, wide, there, were, also, the, tree, covered, islet, near, lang, poolsche, hoed, and, several, small, rocky, islets, or, banks, between, krakatoa, and, verlaten, there, were, three, volcanic, cones, on, krakatoa, island, rakata, 820, m, or, 2, 690, ft, to, the, south, danan, 450, m, or, 1, 480, ft, near, the, center, and, perboewatan, 120, m, or, 390, ft, to, the, north, the, javanese, book, of, kings, pustaka, raja, a, 19th, century, compilation, of, historical, traditions, from, central, java, records, that, in, the, year, 338, aka, 416, ad, a, thundering, sound, was, heard, from, the, mountain, batuwara, which, was, answered, by, a, similar, noise, from, kapi, lying, westward, of, the, modern, bantam, a, great, glowing, fire, which, reached, the, sky, came, out, of, the, last, named, mountain, the, whole, world, was, greatly, shaken, and, violent, thundering, accompanied, by, heavy, rain, and, storms, took, place, but, not, only, did, not, this, heavy, rain, extinguish, the, eruption, of, the, fire, of, the, mountain, kapi, but, augmented, the, fire, the, noise, was, fearful, at, last, the, mountain, kapi, with, a, tremendous, roar, burst, into, pieces, and, sank, into, the, deepest, of, the, earth, the, water, of, the, sea, rose, and, inundated, the, land, the, country, to, the, east, of, the, mountain, batuwara, to, the, mountain, rajabasa, was, inundated, by, the, sea, the, inhabitants, of, the, northern, part, of, the, sunda, country, to, the, mountain, rajabasa, were, drowned, and, swept, away, with, all, property, the, water, subsided, but, the, land, on, which, kapi, stood, became, sea, and, java, and, sumatra, were, divided, into, two, parts, the, pustaka, raja, does, not, draw, on, primary, sources, for, its, description, of, this, event, and, its, historical, reliability, is, highly, dubious, it, is, therefore, impossible, to, verify, its, description, of, this, eruption, there, is, no, geological, evidence, presented, that, substantiates, this, eruption, david, keys, ken, wohletz, and, others, have, postulated, that, a, violent, volcanic, eruption, possibly, of, krakatoa, in, 535, was, responsible, for, the, global, climate, changes, of, 535, 536, drilling, projects, in, sunda, strait, ruled, out, any, possibility, that, an, eruption, took, place, in, 535, ad, thornton, mentions, that, krakatoa, was, known, as, the, fire, mountain, during, java, s, sailendra, dynasty, with, records, of, seven, eruptive, events, between, the, 9th, and, 16th, centuries, these, have, been, tentatively, dated, as, having, occurred, in, 850, 950, 1050, 1150, 1320, and, 1530, in, february, 1681, johann, wilhelm, vogel, a, dutch, mining, engineer, at, salida, sumatra, near, padang, on, his, way, to, batavia, now, jakarta, passed, through, the, sunda, strait, in, his, diary, he, wrote, i, saw, with, amazement, that, the, island, of, krakatoa, on, my, first, trip, to, sumatra, completely, green, and, healthy, with, trees, lay, completely, burnt, and, barren, in, front, of, our, eyes, and, that, at, four, locations, was, throwing, up, large, chunks, of, fire, and, when, i, asked, the, ship, s, captain, when, the, aforementioned, island, had, erupted, he, told, me, that, this, had, happened, in, may, 1680, he, showed, me, a, piece, of, pumice, as, big, as, his, fist, vogel, spent, several, months, in, batavia, returning, to, sumatra, in, november, 1681, on, the, same, ship, were, several, other, dutch, travellers, including, elias, hesse, a, writer, hesse, s, journal, reports, on, the, 19th, we, again, lifted, anchor, and, proceeded, first, to, the, north, of, us, to, the, island, of, sleepzie, sebesi, uninhabited, and, then, still, north, of, the, island, of, krakatou, which, erupted, about, a, year, ago, and, also, is, uninhabited, the, rising, smoke, column, of, this, island, can, be, seen, from, miles, away, we, were, with, our, ship, very, close, to, shore, and, we, could, see, the, trees, sticking, out, high, on, the, mountain, and, which, looked, completely, burned, but, we, could, not, see, the, fire, itself, the, eruption, was, also, reported, by, a, bengali, sea, captain, who, wrote, of, the, event, later, but, had, not, recorded, it, at, the, time, in, the, ship, s, log, neither, vogel, nor, hesse, mention, krakatoa, in, any, real, detail, in, their, other, passages, and, no, other, travellers, at, the, time, mention, an, eruption, or, evidence, of, one, in, november, 1681, a, pepper, crop, was, being, offered, for, sale, by, inhabitants, simon, winchester, maintains, in, his, 2003, book, krakatoa, the, day, the, world, exploded, august, 27, 1883, that, the, 1680, eruption, was, depicted, in, an, eighteenth, century, etching, by, dutch, cartographer, jan, van, schley, called, het, brandende, eiland, the, burning, island, writing, that, it, was, a, depiction, without, a, doubt, of, the, otherwise, little, chronicled, eruption, that, supposedly, took, place, in, 1680, in, 1880, verbeek, investigated, a, fresh, unweathered, lava, flow, at, the, northern, coast, of, perboewatan, which, he, claimed, could, not, have, been, more, than, two, centuries, old, in, february, 1780, the, crews, of, hms, resolution, 1771, and, hms, discovery, 1774, on, the, way, home, after, captain, james, cook, s, death, in, hawai, i, stopped, for, a, few, days, on, krakatoa, they, found, a, freshwater, and, a, hot, spring, on, the, island, they, described, the, natives, who, then, lived, on, the, island, as, friendly, and, made, several, sketches, in, his, journal, john, ledyard, calls, the, island, cocoterra, edmund, roberts, calls, the, island, crokatoa, in, his, journal, a, paraphrased, account, follows, on, 8, september, 1832, us, sloop, of, war, peacock, anchored, off, the, north, end, also, visiting, lang, island, in, search, of, inhabitants, fresh, water, and, yams, it, was, found, difficult, to, land, anywhere, due, to, a, heavy, surf, and, to, the, coral, having, extended, itself, to, a, considerable, distance, from, the, shore, hot, springs, boiling, furiously, up, through, many, fathoms, of, water, were, found, on, the, eastern, side, of, krakatoa, 150, feet, 46, m, from, the, shore, roberts, captain, geisinger, and, marine, lieutenant, fowler, visited, forsaken, island, having, mistaken, the, singing, of, locusts, for, the, sound, of, running, water, the, boat, glided, over, crystal, clear, water, over, an, extensive, and, highly, beautiful, submarine, garden, corals, of, every, shape, and, hue, were, there, some, resembling, sunflowers, and, mushrooms, others, cabbages, from, 1, to, 36, inches, 3, to, 91, cm, in, diameter, while, a, third, type, bore, a, striking, likeness, to, the, rose, the, hillsides, were, typical, of, tropical, climate, large, flocks, of, parrots, monkeys, in, great, variety, wild, mango, and, orange, groves, a, superb, scene, of, plants, and, flowers, of, every, description, glowing, in, vivid, tints, of, purple, red, blue, brown, and, green, but, not, water, or, provisions, in, 1620, the, dutch, set, up, a, naval, station, on, the, islands, and, somewhat, later, a, shipyard, was, built, sometime, in, the, late, 17th, century, an, attempt, was, made, to, establish, a, pepper, plantation, on, krakatoa, but, the, islands, were, generally, ignored, by, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, 1809, a, penal, colony, was, established, at, an, unspecified, location, which, was, in, operation, for, about, a, decade, by, the, 1880s, the, islands, were, without, permanent, inhabitants, the, nearest, settlement, was, the, nearby, island, of, sebesi, about, 12, km, or, 7, 5, mi, away, with, a, population, of, 3, 000, several, surveys, and, mariners, charts, were, made, and, the, islands, were, little, explored, or, studied, an, 1854, map, of, the, islands, was, used, in, an, english, chart, which, shows, some, difference, from, a, dutch, chart, made, in, 1874, in, july, 1880, rogier, verbeek, made, an, official, survey, of, the, islands, but, was, allowed, to, spend, only, a, few, hours, there, he, was, able, to, collect, samples, from, several, places, and, his, investigation, later, proved, important, in, judging, the, geological, impact, of, the, 1883, eruption, 9, while, seismic, activity, around, the, volcano, was, intense, in, the, years, preceding, the, cataclysmic, 1883, eruption, a, series, of, lesser, eruptions, began, on, 20, may, 1883, the, volcano, released, huge, plumes, of, steam, and, ash, lasting, until, late, august, on, 27, august, a, series, of, four, huge, explosions, almost, destroyed, the, island, the, explosions, were, so, violent, that, they, were, heard, 3, 110, km, 1, 930, mi, away, in, perth, western, australia, and, the, island, of, rodrigues, near, mauritius, 4, 800, km, 3, 000, mi, away, the, pressure, wave, from, the, third, and, most, violent, explosion, was, recorded, on, barographs, around, the, world, several, barographs, recorded, the, wave, seven, times, over, the, course, of, five, days, four, times, with, the, wave, travelling, away, from, the, volcano, to, its, antipodal, point, and, three, times, travelling, back, to, the, volcano, 63, the, wave, rounded, the, globe, three, and, a, half, times, ash, was, propelled, to, a, height, of, 80, km, 260, 000, ft, it, was, reported, that, the, sound, of, the, eruption, was, so, loud, that, anyone, within, 16, kilometres, 10, mi, would, have, gone, deaf, the, combined, effects, of, pyroclastic, flows, volcanic, ashes, and, tsunamis, had, disastrous, results, in, the, region, and, worldwide, the, death, toll, recorded, by, the, dutch, authorities, was, 36, 417, although, some, sources, put, the, estimate, at, more, than, 120, 000, there, are, numerous, documented, reports, of, groups, of, human, skeletons, floating, across, the, indian, ocean, on, rafts, of, volcanic, pumice, and, washing, up, on, the, east, coast, of, africa, up, to, a, year, after, the, eruption, summer, temperatures, in, the, northern, hemisphere, fell, by, an, average, of, 0, 4, c, 0, 72, f, in, the, year, following, the, eruption, verbeek, in, his, report, on, the, eruption, predicted, that, any, new, activity, would, manifest, itself, in, the, region, which, had, been, between, perboewatan, and, danan, this, prediction, came, true, on, 29, december, 1927, when, a, submarine, lava, dome, in, the, area, of, perboewatan, showed, evidence, of, eruptions, an, earlier, event, in, the, same, area, had, been, reported, in, june, 1927, a, new, island, volcano, rose, above, the, waterline, a, few, days, later, the, eruptions, were, initially, of, pumice, and, ash, and, that, island, and, the, two, islands, that, followed, were, quickly, eroded, away, by, the, sea, eventually, a, fourth, island, named, anak, krakatau, meaning, child, of, krakatoa, in, indonesian, broke, water, in, august, 1930, and, produced, lava, flows, more, quickly, than, the, waves, could, erode, them, on, october, 2, 1883, five, weeks, after, the, eruption, a, dutch, soldier, was, repeatedly, stabbed, by, a, bearded, white, robed, man, while, paying, for, tobacco, in, the, small, town, of, serang, the, would, be, assassin, was, never, captured, but, a, similarly, dressed, man, attacked, a, sentry, at, the, garrison, six, weeks, later, blaming, the, dutch, for, bringing, divine, vengeance, upon, the, area, the, extreme, religious, zeal, noted, by, the, man, s, interrogators, seen, as, widespread, and, historians, suggest, it, was, exploited, by, rising, muslim, conservatives, and, anticolonial, leaders, such, as, abdul, karim, amrullah, to, foment, the, banten, peasant, s, revolt, in, 1888, and, to, prey, upon, the, dutch, conscience, made, uneasy, by, max, havelaar, and, subsequent, revelations, of, abuses, the, explosion, was, the, first, natural, disaster, in, history, whose, effects, were, definitively, felt, worldwide, and, whose, cause, was, known, following, the, development, of, transoceanic, communication, cables, winchester, suggests, the, disaster, marks, the, birth, of, an, era, of, global, awareness, the, islands, have, become, a, major, case, study, of, island, biogeography, and, founder, populations, in, an, ecosystem, being, built, from, the, ground, up, in, an, environment, virtually, cleaned, the, islands, had, been, little, studied, or, biologically, surveyed, before, the, 1883, catastrophe, only, two, pre, 1883, biological, collections, are, known, one, of, plant, specimens, and, the, other, part, of, a, shell, collection, from, descriptions, and, drawings, made, by, hms, discovery, the, flora, appears, to, have, been, representative, of, a, typical, javan, tropical, climax, forest, the, pre, 1883, fauna, is, virtually, unknown, but, was, probably, typical, of, the, smaller, islands, in, the, area, from, a, biological, perspective, the, krakatau, problem, refers, to, the, question, of, whether, the, islands, were, completely, sterilized, by, the, 1883, eruption, or, whether, some, indigenous, life, survived, when, the, first, researchers, reached, the, islands, in, may, 1884, the, only, living, thing, they, found, was, a, spider, in, a, crevice, on, the, south, side, of, rakata, life, quickly, recolonized, the, islands, however, verbeek, s, visit, in, october, 1884, found, grass, shoots, already, growing, the, eastern, side, of, the, island, has, been, extensively, vegetated, by, trees, and, shrubs, presumably, brought, there, as, seeds, washed, up, by, ocean, currents, or, carried, in, birds, droppings, or, brought, by, natives, and, scientific, investigators, however, the, floral, ecosystem, on, rakata, is, considerably, vulnerable, to, environmental, factors, and, has, been, damaged, by, recent, eruptions, at, anak, krakatau, in, 1914, plans, were, to, set, aside, rakata, as, a, nature, preserve, in, 1916, johann, handl, a, german, pumice, collector, obtained, a, permit, to, mine, pumice, against, strong, community, objections, apparently, to, get, away, from, world, war, i, his, lease, of, 8, 7, square, kilometres, 3, 4, sq, mi, basically, the, eastern, half, of, the, island, was, to, be, for, 30, years, handl, took, up, residence, on, the, south, coast, of, rakata, where, he, built, a, house, and, planted, a, garden, along, with, four, european, families, and, about, 30, coolies, handl, found, un, burned, wood, below, the, 1883, ash, deposits, while, digging, and, fresh, water, was, found, below, 5, 5, metres, 18, ft, he, and, his, entourage, stayed, there, for, four, years, but, left, due, to, violation, of, the, terms, of, the, lease, it, is, his, party, that, is, believed, to, have, inadvertently, introduced, the, black, rat, to, the, island, which, quickly, proliferated, krakatoa, was, declared, as, a, nature, reserve, in, 1921, corresponding, to, iucn, management, category, ia, strict, nature, reserve, along, with, several, other, nature, reserves, it, was, proposed, as, a, national, park, in, 1980, in, 1991, ujung, kulon, national, park, and, krakatau, nature, reserve, was, inscribed, as, an, unesco, world, heritage, site, matching, natural,
