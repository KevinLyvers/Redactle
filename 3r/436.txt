the, failure, to, take, the, city, the, war, that, took, place, between, pharaoh, taharqa, and, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, was, a, decisive, event, in, western, history, with, the, nubians, being, defeated, in, their, attempts, to, gain, a, foothold, in, the, near, east, by, assyria, sennacherib, s, successor, esarhaddon, went, further, and, invaded, egypt, itself, to, secure, his, control, of, the, levant, this, succeeded, as, he, managed, to, expel, taharqa, from, lower, egypt, taharqa, fled, back, to, upper, egypt, and, nubia, where, he, died, two, years, later, lower, egypt, came, under, assyrian, vassalage, but, proved, unruly, unsuccessfully, rebelling, against, the, assyrians, then, the, king, tantamani, a, successor, of, taharqa, made, a, final, determined, attempt, to, regain, lower, egypt, from, the, newly, reinstated, assyrian, vassal, necho, i, he, managed, to, retake, memphis, killing, necho, in, the, process, and, besieged, cities, in, the, nile, delta, ashurbanipal, who, had, succeeded, esarhaddon, sent, a, large, army, in, egypt, to, regain, control, he, routed, tantamani, near, memphis, and, pursuing, him, sacked, thebes, although, the, assyrians, immediately, departed, upper, egypt, after, these, events, weakened, thebes, peacefully, submitted, itself, to, necho, s, son, psamtik, i, less, than, a, decade, later, this, ended, all, hopes, of, a, revival, of, the, nubian, empire, which, rather, continued, in, the, form, of, a, smaller, kingdom, centred, on, napata, the, city, was, raided, by, the, egyptian, c, 590, bc, and, sometime, soon, after, to, the, late, 3rd, century, bc, the, kushite, resettled, in, mero, on, the, turn, of, the, fifth, century, the, blemmyes, established, a, short, lived, state, in, upper, egypt, and, lower, nubia, probably, centred, around, talmis, kalabsha, but, before, 450, they, were, already, driven, out, of, the, nile, valley, by, the, nobatians, the, latter, eventually, founded, a, kingdom, on, their, own, nobatia, by, the, sixth, century, there, were, in, total, three, nubian, kingdoms, nobatia, in, the, north, which, had, its, capital, at, pachoras, faras, the, central, kingdom, makuria, centred, at, tungul, old, dongola, about, 13, kilometres, 8, miles, south, of, modern, dongola, and, alodia, in, the, heartland, of, the, old, kushitic, kingdom, which, had, its, capital, at, soba, now, a, suburb, of, modern, day, khartoum, still, in, the, sixth, century, they, converted, to, christianity, in, the, seventh, century, probably, at, some, point, between, 628, and, 642, nobatia, was, incorporated, into, makuria, between, 639, and, 641, the, muslim, arabs, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, conquered, byzantine, egypt, in, 641, or, 642, and, again, in, 652, they, invaded, nubia, but, were, repelled, making, the, nubians, one, of, the, few, who, managed, to, defeat, the, arabs, during, the, islamic, expansion, afterward, the, makurian, king, and, the, arabs, agreed, on, a, unique, non, aggression, pact, that, also, included, an, annual, exchange, of, gifts, thus, acknowledging, makuria, s, independence, while, the, arabs, failed, to, conquer, nubia, they, began, to, settle, east, of, the, nile, where, they, eventually, founded, several, port, towns, and, intermarried, with, the, local, beja, from, the, mid, eighth, to, mid, eleventh, century, the, political, power, and, cultural, development, of, christian, nubia, peaked, in, 747, makuria, invaded, egypt, which, at, this, time, belonged, to, the, declining, umayyads, and, it, did, so, again, in, the, early, 960s, when, it, pushed, as, far, north, as, akhmim, makuria, maintained, close, dynastic, ties, with, alodia, perhaps, resulting, in, the, temporary, unification, of, the, two, kingdoms, into, one, state, the, culture, of, the, medieval, nubians, has, been, described, as, afro, byzantine, but, was, also, increasingly, influenced, by, arab, culture, the, state, organisation, was, extremely, centralised, being, based, on, the, byzantine, bureaucracy, of, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, arts, flourished, in, the, form, of, pottery, paintings, and, especially, wall, paintings, the, nubians, developed, an, alphabet, for, their, language, old, nobiin, basing, it, on, the, coptic, alphabet, while, also, using, greek, coptic, and, arabic, women, enjoyed, high, social, status, they, had, access, to, education, could, own, buy, and, sell, land, and, often, used, their, wealth, to, endow, churches, and, church, paintings, even, the, royal, succession, was, matrilineal, with, the, son, of, the, king, s, sister, being, the, rightful, heir, from, the, late, 11th, 12th, century, makuria, s, capital, dongola, was, in, decline, and, alodia, s, capital, declined, in, the, 12th, century, as, well, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, bedouin, tribes, overran, most, of, sudan, migrating, to, the, butana, the, gezira, kordofan, and, darfur, in, 1365, a, civil, war, forced, the, makurian, court, to, flee, to, gebel, adda, in, lower, nubia, while, dongola, was, destroyed, and, left, to, the, arabs, afterwards, makuria, continued, to, exist, only, as, a, petty, kingdom, after, the, prosperous, reign, of, king, joel, fl, 1463, 1484, makuria, collapsed, coastal, areas, from, southern, sudan, up, to, the, port, city, of, suakin, was, succeeded, by, the, adal, sultanate, in, the, fifteenth, century, to, the, south, the, kingdom, of, alodia, fell, to, either, the, arabs, commanded, by, tribal, leader, abdallah, jamma, or, the, funj, an, african, people, originating, from, the, south, datings, range, from, the, 9th, century, after, the, hijra, c, 1396, 1494, the, late, 15th, century, 1504, to, 1509, an, alodian, rump, state, might, have, survived, in, the, form, of, the, kingdom, of, fazughli, lasting, until, 1685, in, 1504, the, funj, are, recorded, to, have, founded, the, kingdom, of, sennar, in, which, abdallah, jamma, s, realm, was, incorporated, by, 1523, when, jewish, traveller, david, reubeni, visited, sudan, the, funj, state, already, extended, as, far, north, as, dongola, meanwhile, islam, began, to, be, preached, on, the, nile, by, sufi, holy, men, who, settled, there, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, and, by, david, reubeni, s, visit, king, amara, dunqas, previously, a, pagan, or, nominal, christian, was, recorded, to, be, muslim, however, the, funj, would, retain, un, islamic, customs, like, the, divine, kingship, or, the, consumption, of, alcohol, until, the, 18th, century, sudanese, folk, islam, preserved, many, rituals, stemming, from, christian, traditions, until, the, recent, past, soon, the, funj, came, in, conflict, with, the, ottomans, who, had, occupied, suakin, c, 1526, and, eventually, pushed, south, along, the, nile, reaching, the, third, nile, cataract, area, in, 1583, 1584, a, subsequent, ottoman, attempt, to, capture, dongola, was, repelled, by, the, funj, in, 1585, afterwards, hannik, located, just, south, of, the, third, cataract, would, mark, the, border, between, the, two, states, the, aftermath, of, the, ottoman, invasion, saw, the, attempted, usurpation, of, ajib, a, minor, king, of, northern, nubia, while, the, funj, eventually, killed, him, in, 1611, 1612, his, successors, the, abdallab, were, granted, to, govern, everything, north, of, the, confluence, of, blue, and, white, niles, with, considerable, autonomy, during, the, 17th, century, the, funj, state, reached, its, widest, extent, but, in, the, following, century, it, began, to, decline, a, coup, in, 1718, brought, a, dynastic, change, while, another, one, in, 1761, 1762, resulted, in, the, hamaj, regency, where, the, hamaj, a, people, from, the, ethiopian, borderlands, effectively, ruled, while, the, funj, sultans, were, their, mere, puppets, shortly, afterwards, the, sultanate, began, to, fragment, by, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, essentially, restricted, to, the, gezira, the, coup, of, 1718, kicked, off, a, policy, of, pursuing, a, more, orthodox, islam, which, in, turn, promoted, the, arabisation, of, the, state, to, legitimise, their, rule, over, their, arab, subjects, the, funj, began, to, propagate, an, umayyad, descend, north, of, the, confluence, of, the, blue, and, white, niles, as, far, downstream, as, al, dabbah, the, nubians, adopted, the, tribal, identity, of, the, arab, jaalin, until, the, 19th, century, arabic, had, succeeded, in, becoming, the, dominant, language, of, central, riverine, sudan, and, most, of, kordofan, west, of, the, nile, in, darfur, the, islamic, period, saw, at, first, the, rise, of, the, tunjur, kingdom, which, replaced, the, old, daju, kingdom, in, the, 15th, century, and, extended, as, far, west, as, wadai, the, tunjur, people, were, probably, arabised, berbers, and, their, ruling, elite, at, least, muslims, in, the, 17th, century, the, tunjur, were, driven, from, power, by, the, fur, keira, sultanate, the, keira, state, nominally, muslim, since, the, reign, of, sulayman, solong, r, c, 1660, 1680, was, initially, a, small, kingdom, in, northern, jebel, marra, but, expanded, west, and, northwards, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, eastwards, under, the, rule, of, muhammad, tayrab, r, 1751, 1786, peaking, in, the, conquest, of, kordofan, in, 1785, the, apogee, of, this, empire, now, roughly, the, size, of, present, day, nigeria, would, last, until, 1821, in, 1821, the, ottoman, ruler, of, egypt, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, had, invaded, and, conquered, northern, sudan, although, technically, the, vali, of, egypt, under, the, ottoman, empire, muhammad, ali, styled, himself, as, khedive, of, a, virtually, independent, egypt, seeking, to, add, sudan, to, his, domains, he, sent, his, third, son, ismail, not, to,
