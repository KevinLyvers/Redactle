victoria, falls, lozi, mosi, oa, tunya, thundering, smoke, tonga, shungu, namutitima, boiling, water, is, a, waterfall, on, the, zambezi, river, located, on, the, border, between, zambia, and, zimbabwe, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, waterfalls, with, a, width, of, 1, 708, m, 5, 604, ft, the, region, around, it, is, inhabited, by, several, species, of, plants, and, animals, archaeology, and, oral, history, describe, a, long, record, of, african, knowledge, of, the, site, although, known, to, some, european, geographers, before, the, 19th, century, scottish, missionary, david, livingstone, identified, the, falls, in, 1855, naming, them, victoria, falls, after, queen, victoria, since, the, mid, 20th, century, the, site, has, been, a, major, tourist, destination, zambia, and, zimbabwe, both, have, national, parks, and, tourism, infrastructure, at, the, site, research, in, the, late, 2010s, found, that, precipitation, variability, due, to, climate, change, is, likely, to, alter, the, character, of, the, falls, david, livingstone, was, the, first, european, recorded, to, have, viewed, the, falls, on, 16, november, 1855, from, an, island, now, known, as, livingstone, island, one, of, two, land, masses, in, the, middle, of, the, river, immediately, upstream, from, the, falls, near, the, zambian, shore, livingstone, named, his, sighting, in, honour, of, queen, victoria, but, the, sotho, language, name, mosi, oa, tunya, the, smoke, that, thunders, continues, in, common, usage, the, world, heritage, list, officially, recognises, both, names, livingstone, also, cited, an, older, name, seongo, or, chongwe, which, means, the, place, of, the, rainbow, as, a, result, of, the, constant, spray, the, nearby, national, park, in, zambia, is, named, mosi, oa, tunya, whereas, the, national, park, and, town, on, the, zimbabwean, shore, are, both, named, victoria, falls, victoria, falls, is, classified, as, the, largest, based, on, its, combined, width, of, 1, 708, metres, 5, 604, ft, and, height, of, 108, metres, 354, ft, resulting, in, the, world, s, largest, sheet, of, falling, water, for, a, considerable, distance, upstream, from, the, falls, the, zambezi, flows, over, a, level, sheet, of, basalt, in, a, shallow, valley, bounded, by, low, and, distant, sandstone, hills, the, river, s, course, is, dotted, with, numerous, tree, covered, islands, which, increase, in, number, where, the, river, approaches, the, falls, there, is, a, flat, plateau, extending, in, all, directions, the, falls, are, formed, where, the, full, width, of, the, river, plummets, in, a, single, vertical, drop, into, a, transverse, chasm, 1, 708, metres, 5, 604, ft, wide, carved, along, a, fracture, zone, in, the, basalt, plateau, the, depth, of, the, chasm, called, the, first, gorge, varies, from, 80, metres, 260, ft, at, its, western, end, to, 108, metres, 354, ft, in, the, centre, the, only, outlet, from, the, first, gorge, is, a, 110, metre, wide, 360, ft, gap, about, two, thirds, of, the, way, across, the, width, of, the, falls, from, the, western, end, the, whole, volume, of, the, river, pours, into, the, victoria, falls, gorges, from, this, narrow, cleft, there, are, two, islands, on, the, crest, of, the, falls, boaruka, island, or, cataract, island, near, the, western, bank, and, livingstone, island, near, the, middle, at, less, than, full, flood, additional, islets, divide, the, curtain, of, water, into, separate, parallel, streams, the, main, streams, are, named, in, order, from, zimbabwe, west, to, zambia, east, the, devil, s, cataract, called, leaping, water, by, some, the, main, falls, the, rainbow, falls, the, highest, and, the, eastern, cataract, the, river, zambezi, upstream, from, the, falls, experiences, a, rainy, season, from, late, november, to, early, april, and, a, dry, season, the, rest, of, the, year, the, river, s, annual, flood, season, is, february, to, may, with, a, peak, in, april, the, spray, from, the, falls, typically, rises, to, a, height, of, over, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, sometimes, up, to, twice, as, high, and, is, visible, from, up, to, 50, km, 30, mi, away, at, full, moon, a, moonbow, can, also, be, seen, during, the, flood, season, however, the, foot, and, the, face, of, the, waterfall, can, t, be, seen, when, the, dry, season, takes, effect, the, islets, on, the, crest, become, wider, and, more, numerous, from, september, to, january, up, to, half, of, the, rocky, face, of, the, falls, may, become, dry, allowing, the, bottom, of, the, first, gorge, to, be, seen, along, most, of, its, length, at, this, time, it, becomes, possible, though, not, necessarily, safe, to, walk, across, some, stretches, of, the, river, at, the, crest, it, is, also, possible, to, walk, to, the, bottom, of, the, first, gorge, at, the, zimbabwean, side, the, minimum, flow, which, occurs, in, november, is, around, a, tenth, of, the, april, figure, this, variation, in, flow, is, greater, than, that, of, other, major, falls, and, causes, the, victoria, falls, annual, average, flow, rate, to, be, lower, than, might, be, expected, based, on, the, maximum, flow, in, 2019, unusually, low, rain, dramatically, reduced, the, fall, to, the, lowest, flow, in, a, century, global, climate, change, and, changed, climate, patterns, are, suggested, to, have, caused, this, the, entire, volume, of, the, zambezi, river, pours, through, the, first, gorge, s, 110, metre, wide, 360, ft, exit, for, a, distance, of, about, 150, metres, 490, ft, then, enters, a, zigzagging, series, of, gorges, designated, by, the, order, in, which, the, river, reaches, them, water, entering, the, second, gorge, makes, a, sharp, right, turn, and, has, carved, out, a, deep, pool, there, called, the, boiling, pot, reached, via, a, steep, footpath, from, the, zambian, side, it, is, about, 150, m, 500, ft, across, its, surface, is, smooth, at, low, water, but, at, high, water, is, marked, by, enormous, slow, swirls, and, heavy, turbulence, the, principal, gorges, are, the, upper, zambezi, river, originally, drained, south, through, present, day, botswana, to, join, the, limpopo, river, a, general, uplift, of, the, land, between, zimbabwe, and, the, kalahari, desert, about, 2, million, years, ago, blocked, this, drainage, route, and, a, large, paleolake, known, as, lake, makgadikgadi, formed, between, the, kalahari, and, the, batoka, basaltic, plateau, of, zimbabwe, and, zambia, this, lake, was, originally, endorheic, and, had, no, natural, outlet, under, wetter, climate, conditions, about, 20, 000, years, bp, it, eventually, overflowed, and, began, to, drain, to, the, east, cutting, the, batoka, gorge, through, the, basalt, the, recent, geological, history, of, victoria, falls, can, be, seen, in, the, overall, form, of, the, batoka, gorge, with, its, six, individual, gorges, and, eight, past, positions, of, the, falls, the, east, west, oriented, gorges, imply, structural, control, with, alignment, along, joints, of, shatter, zones, or, faults, with, 50, metres, 160, ft, of, vertical, displacement, as, is, the, case, of, the, second, and, fifth, gorges, headward, erosion, along, these, structural, lines, of, weakness, would, establish, a, new, fall, line, and, abandonment, of, the, earlier, line, north, south, oriented, joints, control, the, south, flowing, sections, of, the, river, one, of, these, is, the, boiling, pot, which, links, the, first, gorge, with, the, second, gorge, 147, 149, the, falls, may, have, already, started, cutting, back, the, next, major, gorge, at, the, dip, in, one, side, of, the, devil, s, cataract, between, the, western, river, bank, and, cataract, island, the, lip, in, the, current, falls, is, lowest, here, and, carries, the, greatest, concentration, of, water, at, flood, stage, 149, the, sedimentary, sequence, overlying, the, basalt, at, the, zambezi, river, margins, is, called, the, victoria, falls, formation, which, consists, of, gravel, the, pipe, sandstone, kalahari, sand, aeolian, sand, and, alluvium, a, 15, 45, m, scarp, bounds, the, river, about, 5, 6, km, from, the, main, channel, and, a, series, of, river, terraces, are, evident, between, the, scarp, and, the, channel, 144, 145, the, basalt, plateau, of, victoria, falls, over, which, the, zambezi, river, flows, was, formed, during, the, jurassic, period, around, 200, million, years, ago, early, stone, age, acheulean, stone, artefacts, and, oldowan, tools, were, excavated, at, archaeological, sites, around, the, falls, as, well, as, sangoan, tools, and, lupemban, artefacts, dating, to, the, middle, stone, age, early, iron, age, pottery, was, excavated, at, a, vlei, site, near, masuma, dam, in, the, early, 1960s, evidence, for, iron, smelting, was, also, found, in, a, settlement, dated, to, the, late, first, millennium, ad, the, southern, tonga, people, known, as, the, batoka, tokalea, called, the, falls, shungu, na, mutitima, the, matabele, later, arrivals, named, them, amanz, athunqayo, and, the, batswana, and, makololo, whose, language, is, used, by, the, lozi, people, call, them, mosi, o, tunya, all, these, names, mean, essentially, the, smoke, that, thunders, a, map, drawn, by, nicolas, de, fer, in, 1715, shows, the, fall, clearly, marked, in, the, correct, position, it, also, shows, dotted, lines, denoting, trade, routes, that, david, livingstone, followed, 140, years, later, a, map, from, c, 1750, drawn, by, jacques, nicolas, bellin, for, abb, antoine, fran, ois, prevost, d, exiles, marks, the, falls, as, cataractes, and, notes, a, settlement, to, the, north, of, the, zambezi, as, being, friendly, with, the, portuguese, at, the, time, in, november, 1855, david, livingstone, was, the, first, european, who, saw, the, falls, when, he, travelled, from, the, upper, zambezi, to, the, mouth, of, the, river, between, 1852, and, 1856, the, falls, were, well, known, to, local, tribes, and, voortrekker, hunters, may, have, known, of, them, as, may, the, arabs, under, a, name, equivalent, to, the, end, of, the, world, europeans, were, sceptical, of, their, reports, perhaps, thinking, that, the, lack, of, mountains, and, valleys, on, the, plateau, made, a, large, falls, unlikely, livingstone, had, been, told, about, the, falls, before, he, reached, them, from, upriver, and, was, paddled, across, to, the, livingstone, island, in, zambia, in, 1860, livingstone, returned, to, the, area, and, made, a, detailed, study, of, the, falls, with, john, kirk, other, early, european, visitors, included, portuguese, explorer, serpa, pinto, czech, explorer, emil, holub, who, made, the, first, detailed, plan, of, the, falls, and, its, surroundings, in, 1875, published, in, 1880, and, british, artist, thomas, baines, who, executed, some, of, the, earliest, paintings, of, the, falls, until, the, area, was, opened, up, by, the, building, of, the, railway, in, 1905, though, the, falls, were, seldom, visited, by, other, europeans, some, writers, believe, that, the, portuguese, priest, gon, alo, da, silveira, was, the, first, european, to, catch, sight, of, the, falls, back, in, the, sixteenth, century, european, settlement, of, the, victoria, falls, area, started, around, 1900, in, response, to, the, desire, of, cecil, rhodes, british, south, africa, company, for, mineral, rights, and, imperial, rule, north, of, the, zambezi, and, the, exploitation, of, other, natural, resources, such, as, timber, forests, north, east, of, the, falls, and, ivory, and, animal, skins, before, 1905, the, river, was, crossed, above, the, falls, at, the, old, drift, by, dugout, canoe, or, a, barge, towed, across, with, a, steel, cable, rhodes, vision, of, a, cape, cairo, railway, drove, plans, for, the, first, bridge, across, the, zambezi, he, insisted, it, be, built, where, the, spray, from, the, falls, would, fall, on, passing, trains, so, the, site, at, the, second, gorge, was, chosen, see, the, main, article, victoria, falls, bridge, for, details, from, 1905, the, railway, offered, accessible, travel, from, as, far, as, the, cape, in, the, south, and, from, 1909, as, far, as, the, belgian, congo, in, the, north, in, 1904, the, victoria, falls, hotel, was, opened, to, accommodate, visitors, arriving, on, the, new, railway, the, falls, became, an, increasingly, popular, attraction, during, british, colonial, rule, of, northern, rhodesia, zambia, and, southern, rhodesia, zimbabwe, with, the, town, of, victoria, falls, becoming, the, main, tourist, centre, in, 1964, northern, rhodesia, became, the, independent, state, of, zambia, the, following, year, rhodesia, unilaterally, declared, independence, this, was, not, recognised, by, zambia, the, united, kingdom, nor, the, vast, majority, of, states, and, led, to, united, nations, mandated, sanctions, in, response, to, the, emerging, crisis, in, 1966, zambia, restricted, or, stopped, border, crossings, it, did, not, re, open, the, border, completely, until, 1980, the, rhodesian, bush, war, erupted, on, the, southern, side, of, the, zambezi, from, 1972, to, 1980, with, terrorist, incursions, from, zambia, mozambique, and, botswana, visitor, numbers, began, to, drop, particularly, on, the, rhodesian, side, periodic, rhodesian, military, cross, border, operations, against, guerrilla, camps, in, zambia, causing, the, zambians, to, impose, security, measures, including, the, stationing, of, soldiers, to, restrict, access, to, the, gorges, and, some, parts, of, the, falls, zimbabwe, s, internationally, recognized, independence, in, 1980, brought, comparative, peace, and, the, 1980s, witnessed, renewed, levels, of, tourism, and, the, development, of, the, region, as, a, centre, for, adventure, sports, activities, that, gained, popularity, in, the, area, include, whitewater, rafting, in, the, gorges, bungee, jumping, from, the, bridge, game, fishing, horse, riding, kayaking, e, biking, and, sightseeing, flights, over, the, falls, by, the, end, of, the, 1990s, almost, 400, 000, people, were, visiting, the, falls, annually, and, this, was, expected, to, rise, to, over, a, million, in, the, next, decade, unlike, the, game, parks, victoria, falls, has, more, zimbabwean, and, zambian, visitors, than, international, tourists, the, attraction, is, accessible, by, bus, and, train, and, is, therefore, comparatively, inexpensive, to, reach, the, numbers, of, visitors, to, the, zimbabwean, side, of, the, falls, has, historically, been, much, higher, than, the, number, visiting, the, zambian, side, due, to, the, greater, development, of, the, visitor, facilities, there, however, the, number, of, tourists, visiting, zimbabwe, began, to, decline, in, the, early, 2000s, as, political, tensions, between, supporters, and, opponents, of, president, robert, mugabe, increased, in, 2006, hotel, occupancy, on, the, zimbabwean, side, hovered, at, around, 30, while, the, zambian, side, was, near, capacity, with, rates, in, top, hotels, reaching, us, 630, per, night, the, rapid, development, has, prompted, the, united, nations, to, consider, revoking, the, falls, status, as, a, world, heritage, site, in, addition, problems, of, waste, disposal, and, a, lack, of, effective, management, of, the, falls, environment, are, a, concern, a, famous, feature, is, the, naturally, formed, devil, s, pool, an, infinity, pool, that, sits, on, the, lip, of, victoria, falls, on, the, zambian, side, along, the, western, tip, of, livingstone, island, when, the, river, flow, is, at, a, certain, level, usually, between, september, and, december, a, rock, barrier, forms, an, eddy, with, minimal, current, allowing, adventurous, swimmers, to, splash, around, in, relative, safety, in, front, of, the, point, where, the, water, cascades, over, the, falls, the, two, national, parks, at, the, falls, are, relatively, small, mosi, oa, tunya, national, park, is, 66, km, 2, 25, sq, mi, and, victoria, falls, national, park, is, 23, km, 2, 8, 9, sq, mi, however, next, to, the, latter, on, the, southern, bank, is, the, zambezi, national, park, extending, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, west, along, the, river, animals, can, move, between, the, two, zimbabwean, parks, and, can, also, reach, matetsi, safari, area, kazuma, pan, national, park, and, hwange, national, park, to, the, south, on, the, zambian, side, fences, and, the, outskirts, of, livingstone, tend, to, confine, most, animals, to, the, mosi, oa, tunya, national, park, in, addition, fences, put, up, by, lodges, in, response, to, crime, restrict, animal, movement, on, botswana, s, side, of, the, border, chobe, national, park, is, a, short, distance, to, travel, to, and, is, a, popular, location, for, a, day, trip, for, many, tourists, visiting, victoria, falls, for, extended, stays, it, offers, more, diverse, flora, and, fauna, than, hwange, national, park, in, 2004, a, separate, group, of, police, called, the, tourism, police, was, started, they, are, commonly, seen, around, the, main, tourist, areas, and, can, be, identified, by, their, uniforms, with, yellow, reflective, bibs, riverine, forest, with, palm, trees, lines, the, banks, and, islands, above, the, falls, the, most, notable, aspect, of, the, area, s, vegetation, though, is, the, rainforest, nurtured, by, the, spray, from, the, falls, containing, plants, rare, for, the, area, such, as, pod, mahogany, ebony, ivory, palm, wild, date, palm, batoko, plum, and, creepers, and, lianas, outside, the, riparian, zone, mopane, woodland, savannah, predominates, in, the, area, with, smaller, areas, of, miombo, and, rhodesian, teak, woodland, and, shrubland, savannah, vegetation, has, suffered, in, recent, droughts, and, so, have, the, animals, that, depend, on, it, particularly, antelope, the, national, parks, contain, abundant, wildlife, including, sizeable, populations, of, elephant, cape, buffalo, giraffe, grant, s, zebra, and, a, variety, of, antelope, lions, african, leopards, and, south, african, cheetahs, are, only, occasionally, seen, vervet, monkeys, and, baboons, are, common, the, river, above, the, falls, contains, large, populations, of, hippopotamus, and, crocodile, african, bush, elephants, cross, the, river, in, the, dry, season, at, particular, crossing, points, klipspringers, honey, badgers, lizards, and, clawless, otters, can, be, glimpsed, in, the, gorges, but, they, are, mainly, known, for, 35, species, of, raptors, the, taita, falcon, verreaux, s, eagle, peregrine, falcon, and, augur, buzzard, breed, there, above, the, falls, herons, african, fish, eagles, and, numerous, kinds, of, waterfowl, are, common, the, river, is, home, to, 39, species, of, fish, below, the, falls, and, 84, species, above, it, this, illustrates, the, effectiveness, of, the, falls, as, a, dividing, barrier, between, the, upper, and, lower, zambezi, in, february, 2020, national, geographic, highlighted, the, threat, to, the, falls, from, extreme, weather, conditions, rising, temperatures, make, the, region, hotter, and, drier, there, is, substantial, water, flow, variability, from, year, to, year, with, a, significant, drop, in, the, general, trend, of, water, flow, in, september, october, november, and, december, this, is, particularly, pronounced, in, drought, years, which, are, becoming, more, frequent, and, intense, such, occurrences, have, affected, the, aesthetics, of, the, waterfalls, and, there, are, fears, that, victoria, falls, might, join, other, world, heritage, sites, categorised, as, last, chance, destinations, recognition, of, the, risks, to, the, falls, has, sparked, great, debate, among, those, in, the, tourism, industry, in, both, zambia, and, zimbabwe, while, it, may, have, had, a, negative, impact, on, tourism, many, experts, in, the, region, dismiss, the, story, as, ill, researched, and, irresponsible, journalism, they, do, not, deny, climate, change, and, the, impact, it, is, having, on, the, amount, of, water, that, cascades, over, the, falls, but, they, argue, the, narrative, is, incomplete
