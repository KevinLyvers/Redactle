the, equator, is, a, circle, of, latitude, that, divides, a, spheroid, such, as, earth, into, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, on, earth, the, equator, is, an, imaginary, line, located, at, 0, degrees, latitude, about, 40, 075, km, 24, 901, mi, in, circumference, halfway, between, the, north, and, south, poles, the, term, can, also, be, used, for, any, other, celestial, body, that, is, roughly, spherical, in, spatial, 3d, geometry, as, applied, in, astronomy, the, equator, of, a, rotating, spheroid, such, as, a, planet, is, the, parallel, circle, of, latitude, at, which, latitude, is, defined, to, be, 0, it, is, an, imaginary, line, on, the, spheroid, equidistant, from, its, poles, dividing, it, into, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, in, other, words, it, is, the, intersection, of, the, spheroid, with, the, plane, perpendicular, to, its, axis, of, rotation, and, midway, between, its, geographical, poles, on, and, near, the, equator, on, earth, noontime, sunlight, appears, almost, directly, overhead, no, more, than, about, 23, from, the, zenith, every, day, year, round, consequently, the, equator, has, a, rather, stable, daytime, temperature, throughout, the, year, on, the, equinoxes, approximately, march, 20, and, september, 23, the, subsolar, point, crosses, earth, s, equator, at, a, shallow, angle, sunlight, shines, perpendicular, to, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, and, all, latitudes, have, nearly, a, 12, hour, day, and, 12, hour, night, the, name, is, derived, from, medieval, latin, word, aequator, in, the, phrase, circulus, aequator, diei, et, noctis, meaning, circle, equalizing, day, and, night, from, the, latin, word, aequare, make, equal, the, latitude, of, the, earth, s, equator, is, by, definition, 0, zero, degrees, of, arc, the, equator, is, one, of, the, five, notable, circles, of, latitude, on, earth, the, other, four, are, the, two, polar, circles, the, arctic, circle, and, the, antarctic, circle, and, the, two, tropical, circles, the, tropic, of, cancer, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, the, equator, is, the, only, line, of, latitude, which, is, also, a, great, circle, meaning, one, whose, plane, passes, through, the, center, of, the, globe, the, plane, of, earth, s, equator, when, projected, outwards, to, the, celestial, sphere, defines, the, celestial, equator, in, the, cycle, of, earth, s, seasons, the, equatorial, plane, runs, through, the, sun, twice, a, year, on, the, equinoxes, in, march, and, september, to, a, person, on, earth, the, sun, appears, to, travel, along, the, equator, or, along, the, celestial, equator, at, these, times, locations, on, the, equator, experience, the, shortest, sunrises, and, sunsets, because, the, sun, s, daily, path, is, nearly, perpendicular, to, the, horizon, for, most, of, the, year, the, length, of, daylight, sunrise, to, sunset, is, almost, constant, throughout, the, year, it, is, about, 14, minutes, longer, than, nighttime, due, to, atmospheric, refraction, and, the, fact, that, sunrise, begins, or, sunset, ends, as, the, upper, limb, not, the, center, of, the, sun, s, disk, contacts, the, horizon, earth, bulges, slightly, at, the, equator, its, average, diameter, is, 12, 742, km, 7, 918, mi, but, the, diameter, at, the, equator, is, about, 43, km, 27, mi, greater, than, at, the, poles, sites, near, the, equator, such, as, the, guiana, space, centre, in, kourou, french, guiana, are, good, locations, for, spaceports, as, they, have, the, fastest, rotational, speed, of, any, latitude, 460, m, 1, 509, ft, sec, the, added, velocity, reduces, the, fuel, needed, to, launch, spacecraft, eastward, in, the, direction, of, earth, s, rotation, to, orbit, while, simultaneously, avoiding, costly, maneuvers, to, flatten, inclination, during, missions, such, as, the, apollo, moon, landings, the, precise, location, of, the, equator, is, not, truly, fixed, the, true, equatorial, plane, is, perpendicular, to, the, earth, s, rotation, axis, which, drifts, about, 9, metres, 30, ft, during, a, year, geological, samples, show, that, the, equator, significantly, changed, positions, between, 48, and, 12, million, years, ago, as, sediment, deposited, by, ocean, thermal, currents, at, the, equator, shifted, the, deposits, by, thermal, currents, are, determined, by, the, axis, of, earth, which, determines, solar, coverage, of, earth, s, surface, changes, in, earth, s, axis, can, also, be, observed, in, the, geographical, layout, of, volcanic, island, chains, which, are, created, by, shifting, hot, spots, under, earth, s, crust, as, the, axis, and, crust, move, this, is, consistent, with, the, indian, tectonic, plate, colliding, with, the, eurasian, tectonic, plate, which, is, causing, the, himalayan, uplift, the, international, association, of, geodesy, iag, and, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, use, an, equatorial, radius, of, 6, 378, 1366, km, 3, 963, 1903, mi, codified, as, the, iau, 2009, value, this, equatorial, radius, is, also, in, the, 2003, and, 2010, iers, conventions, it, is, also, the, equatorial, radius, used, for, the, iers, 2003, ellipsoid, if, it, were, really, circular, the, length, of, the, equator, would, then, be, exactly, 2, times, the, radius, namely, 40, 075, 0142, km, 24, 901, 4594, mi, the, grs, 80, geodetic, reference, system, 1980, as, approved, and, adopted, by, the, iugg, at, its, canberra, australia, meeting, of, 1979, has, an, equatorial, radius, of, 6, 378, 137, km, 3, 963, 191, mi, the, wgs, 84, world, geodetic, system, 1984, which, is, a, standard, for, use, in, cartography, geodesy, and, satellite, navigation, including, gps, also, has, an, equatorial, radius, of, 6, 378, 137, km, 3, 963, 191, mi, for, both, grs, 80, and, wgs, 84, this, results, in, a, length, for, the, equator, of, 40, 075, 0167, km, 24, 901, 4609, mi, the, geographical, mile, is, defined, as, one, arc, minute, of, the, equator, so, it, has, different, values, depending, on, which, radius, is, assumed, for, example, by, wsg, 84, the, distance, is, 1, 855, 3248, metres, 6, 087, 024, ft, while, by, iau, 2000, it, is, 1, 855, 3257, metres, 6, 087, 027, ft, this, is, a, difference, of, less, than, one, millimetre, 0, 039, in, over, the, total, distance, approximately, 1, 86, kilometres, or, 1, 16, miles, earth, is, commonly, modeled, as, a, sphere, flattened, 0, 336, along, its, axis, this, makes, the, equator, 0, 16, longer, than, a, meridian, a, great, circle, passing, through, the, two, poles, the, iugg, standard, meridian, is, to, the, nearest, millimetre, 40, 007, 862917, kilometres, 24, 859, 733480, mi, one, arc, minute, of, which, is, 1, 852, 216, metres, 6, 076, 82, ft, explaining, the, si, standardization, of, the, nautical, mile, as, 1, 852, metres, 6, 076, ft, more, than, 3, metres, 9, 8, ft, less, than, the, geographical, mile, the, sea, level, surface, of, earth, the, geoid, is, irregular, so, the, actual, length, of, the, equator, is, not, so, easy, to, determine, aviation, week, and, space, technology, on, 9, october, 1961, reported, that, measurements, using, the, transit, iv, a, satellite, had, shown, the, equatorial, diameter, from, longitude, 11, west, to, 169, east, to, be, 1, 000, feet, 305, m, greater, than, its, diameter, ninety, degrees, away, download, coordinates, as, the, equator, passes, through, the, land, of, eleven, sovereign, states, indonesia, is, the, country, straddling, the, greatest, length, of, the, equatorial, line, across, both, land, and, sea, starting, at, the, prime, meridian, and, heading, eastwards, the, equator, passes, through, the, equator, also, passes, through, the, territorial, seas, of, three, countries, maldives, south, of, gaafu, dhaalu, atoll, kiribati, south, of, buariki, island, and, the, united, states, south, of, baker, island, despite, its, name, no, part, of, equatorial, guinea, lies, on, the, equator, however, its, island, of, annob, n, is, 155, km, 96, mi, south, of, the, equator, and, the, rest, of, the, country, lies, to, the, north, france, norway, bouvet, island, and, the, united, kingdom, are, the, other, three, northern, hemisphere, based, countries, which, have, territories, in, the, southern, hemisphere, seasons, result, from, the, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, away, from, a, line, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, its, revolution, around, the, sun, throughout, the, year, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, are, alternately, turned, either, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, depending, on, earth, s, position, in, its, orbit, the, hemisphere, turned, toward, the, sun, receives, more, sunlight, and, is, in, summer, while, the, other, hemisphere, receives, less, sun, and, is, in, winter, see, solstice, at, the, equinoxes, earth, s, axis, is, perpendicular, to, the, sun, rather, than, tilted, toward, or, away, meaning, that, day, and, night, are, both, about, 12, hours, long, across, the, whole, of, earth, near, the, equator, this, means, the, variation, in, the, strength, of, solar, radiation, is, different, relative, to, the, time, of, year, than, it, is, at, higher, latitudes, maximum, solar, radiation, is, received, during, the, equinoxes, when, a, place, at, the, equator, is, under, the, subsolar, point, at, high, noon, and, the, intermediate, seasons, of, spring, and, autumn, occur, at, higher, latitudes, and, the, minimum, occurs, during, both, solstices, when, either, pole, is, tilted, towards, or, away, from, the, sun, resulting, in, either, summer, or, winter, in, both, hemispheres, this, also, results, in, a, corresponding, movement, of, the, equator, away, from, the, subsolar, point, which, is, then, situated, over, or, near, the, relevant, tropic, circle, nevertheless, temperatures, are, high, year, round, due, to, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, of, 23, 5, not, being, enough, to, create, a, low, minimum, midday, declination, to, sufficiently, weaken, the, sun, s, rays, even, during, the, solstices, high, year, round, temperatures, extend, to, about, 25, north, or, south, of, the, equator, although, the, moderate, seasonal, temperature, difference, is, defined, by, the, opposing, solstices, as, it, is, at, higher, latitudes, near, the, poleward, limits, of, this, range, near, the, equator, there, is, little, temperature, change, throughout, the, year, though, there, may, be, dramatic, differences, in, rainfall, and, humidity, the, terms, summer, autumn, winter, and, spring, do, not, generally, apply, lowlands, around, the, equator, generally, have, a, tropical, rainforest, climate, also, known, as, an, equatorial, climate, though, cold, ocean, currents, cause, some, regions, to, have, tropical, monsoon, climates, with, a, dry, season, in, the, middle, of, the, year, and, the, somali, current, generated, by, the, asian, monsoon, due, to, continental, heating, via, the, high, tibetan, plateau, causes, greater, somalia, to, have, an, arid, climate, despite, its, equatorial, location, average, annual, temperatures, in, equatorial, lowlands, are, around, 31, c, 88, f, during, the, afternoon, and, 23, c, 73, f, around, sunrise, rainfall, is, very, high, away, from, cold, ocean, current, upwelling, zones, from, 2, 500, to, 3, 500, mm, 100, to, 140, in, per, year, there, are, about, 200, rainy, days, per, year, and, average, annual, sunshine, hours, are, around, 2, 000, despite, high, year, round, sea, level, temperatures, some, higher, altitudes, such, as, the, andes, and, mount, kilimanjaro, have, glaciers, the, highest, point, on, the, equator, is, at, the, elevation, of, 4, 690, metres, 15, 387, ft, at, 0, 0, 0, n, 77, 59, 31, w, 0, 00000, n, 77, 99194, w, 0, 00000, 77, 99194, highest, point, on, the, equator, found, on, the, southern, slopes, of, volc, n, cayambe, in, ecuador, this, is, slightly, above, the, snow, line, and, is, the, only, place, on, the, equator, where, snow, lies, on, the, ground, at, the, equator, the, snow, line, is, around, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, lower, than, on, mount, everest, and, as, much, as, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, lower, than, the, highest, snow, line, in, the, world, near, the, tropic, of, capricorn, on, llullaillaco, there, is, a, widespread, maritime, tradition, of, holding, ceremonies, to, mark, a, sailor, s, first, crossing, of, the, equator, in, the, past, these, ceremonies, have, been, notorious, for, their, brutality, especially, in, naval, practice, milder, line, crossing, ceremonies, typically, featuring, king, neptune, are, also, held, for, passengers, entertainment, on, some, civilian, ocean, liners, and, cruise, ships
