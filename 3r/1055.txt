liverpool, existed, firstly, as, farmland, within, the, west, derby, hundred, before, growing, in, to, a, small, town, of, farmers, fishermen, and, tradesmen, and, tactical, army, base, for, king, john, of, england, the, town, was, planned, with, its, own, castle, although, due, to, outbreaks, of, disease, and, its, subordinance, to, the, nearby, roman, port, of, chester, the, town, s, growth, and, prosperity, stagnated, until, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, substantial, growth, took, place, in, the, mid, late, 18th, century, when, the, town, became, the, most, heavily, involved, european, port, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, king, john, s, letters, patent, of, 1207, announced, the, foundation, of, the, borough, of, liverpool, then, spelt, as, liuerpul, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, place, had, previously, been, a, centre, of, any, trade, the, creation, of, the, borough, was, probably, due, to, king, john, deciding, it, would, be, a, convenient, place, to, embark, men, and, supplies, for, his, irish, campaigns, in, particular, john, s, irish, campaign, of, 1209, the, original, street, plan, of, liverpool, is, said, to, have, been, designed, by,

likely, to, have, fallen, from, an, earlier, peak, of, 1000, people, due, to, slow, trade, and, the, effects, of, the, plague, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, slow, progress, in, trade, and, population, growth, battles, for, control, of, the, town, were, waged, during, the, english, civil, war, including, a, brief, siege, in, 1644, in, 1699, the, same, year, as, its, first, recorded, slave, ship, liverpool, merchant, set, sail, for, africa, liverpool, was, made, a, parish, by, act, of, parliament, but, arguably, the, legislation, of, 1695, that, reformed, the, liverpool, council, was, of, more, significance, to, its, subsequent, development, since, roman, times, the, nearby, city, of, chester, on, the, river, dee, had, been, the, region, s, principal, port, on, the, irish, sea, however, as, the, dee, began, to, silt, up, maritime, trade, from, chester, became, increasingly, difficult, and, shifted, towards, liverpool, on, the, neighbouring, river, mersey, the, first, of, the, liverpool, docks, was, constructed, in, 1715, and, the, system, of, docks, gradually, grew, into, a, large, interconnected, system, as, trade, from, the, west, indies, including, sugar, surpassed, that, of, ireland, and, europe, and, as, the, river, dee, continued, to, silt, up, liverpool, began, to, grow, with, increasing, rapidity, the, first, commercial, wet, dock, was, built, in, liverpool, in, 1715, substantial, profits, from, the, slave, trade, and, tobacco, helped, the, town, to, prosper, and, rapidly, grow, although, several, prominent, local, men, including, william,

reflected, this, wealth, in, 1830, liverpool, and, manchester, became, the, first, cities, to, have, an, intercity, rail, link, through, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, the, population, continued, to, rise, rapidly, especially, during, the, 1840s, when, irish, migrants, began, arriving, by, the, hundreds, of, thousands, as, a, result, of, the, great, famine, while, many, irish, settled, during, this, time, in, the, city, a, large, percentage, also, emigrated, to, the, united, states, or, moved, to, the, industrial, centres, of, lancashire, yorkshire, and, the, midlands, in,

the, late, 19th, century, the, etymology, of, scouser, is, derived, from, the, traditional, dish, scouse, brought, to, the, area, by, sailors, travelling, through, liverpool, s, port, prior, to, the, establishment, of, scouser, as, there, have, been, a, number, of, different, terms, used, to, refer, to, inhabitants, of, liverpool, of, varying, popularity, and, longevity, professor, tony, crowley, argues, that, up, until, the, 1950s, inhabitants, of, liverpool, were, generally, referred, to, by, a, number, of, demonyms, he, argues, that, there, was, a, debate, in, the, mid, 20th, century, between, the, two, rival, terms, of, liverpolitan, and, liverpudlian, the, debate, surrounded, the, lexicology, of, these, terms, and, their, connotations, of, social, class, professor, john, belchem, suggests, that, a, series, of, other, nicknames, such, as, dick, liver, dicky, sam, and, whacker, were, used, but, gradually, fell, out, of, use, belchem, and, philip, boland, suggest, that, comedic, radio, presenters, and, entertainers, brought, the, liverpool, identity, to, a, national, audience, which, in, turn, encouraged, locals, to, be, gradually, more, known, as, scousers, by, the, time, that, frank, shaw, s, my, liverpool, a, celebration, of, scousetown, was, published, in, 1971, belchem, argues, that, scouser, had, firmly, become, the, dominant, demonym, the, city, of, liverpool, is, at, the, core, of, a, much, larger, and, more, populous, metropolitan, area, however, at, the, most, recent, uk, census, in, 2021, the, area, governed, by, liverpool, city, council, had, a, population, of, 486, 100, a, 4, 2, increase, from, the, previous, census, in, 2011, this, figure, increased, to, 500, 500, people, by, 2022, according, to, data, from, liverpool, city, council, taking, in, to, account, how, local, government, is, organised, within, the, cities, and, metropolitan, areas, of, england, the, city, of, liverpool, was, the, fifth, largest, of, england, s, core, cities, and, had, the, second, overall, highest, population, density, of, those, by, 2021, the, population, of, the, city, has, steadily, risen, since, the, 2001, census, as, well, as, having, a, growing, population, the, population, density, also, grew, at, the, 2021, census, compared, to, the, previous, census, this, makes, liverpool, the, second, most, densely, populated, local, authority, in, north, west, england, after, manchester, the, population, of, the, city, is, comparatively, younger, than, that, of, england, as, a, whole, family, life, in, the, city, is, also, growing, at, odds, with, the, north, west, england, region, as, a, whole, at, the, 2021, census, the, percentage, of, households, including, a, couple, without, children, increased, in, liverpool, but, fell, across, the, north, west, the, percentage, of, people, aged, 16, years, and, over, excluding, full, time, students, who, were, employed, also, increased, in, liverpool, compared, to, the, overall,

outside, of, england, has, increased, since, the, previous, census, while, the, number, of, residents, who, did, not, identify, with, any, national, identity, associated, with, the, uk, has, also, increased, at, a, faster, rate, than, england, as, a, whole, the, overall, share, of, the, city, s, population, who, identified, as, asian, and, black, increased, while, the, percentage, who, identified, as, white, decreased, in, the, city, compared, with, previous, census, it, has, been, argued, that, the, city, can, claim, to, have, one, of, the, strongest, irish, heritages, in, the, united, kingdom, with, as, many, as, 75, percent, estimated, of, liverpool, s, population, with, some, form, of, irish, ancestry, the, growing, population, of, liverpool, in, the, 21st, century, reverses, a, trend, which, took, place, between, the, 1930s, and, 2001, when, the, population, of, the, city, proper, effectively, halved, at, the, 1931, united, kingdom, census, liverpool, s, population, reached, an, all, time, high, of, 846, 302, following, this, peak, in, response, to, central, government, policy, the, council, authority, of, liverpool, then, built, and, owned, large,
