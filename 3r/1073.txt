motorway, network, and, a, high, speed, rail, line, with, a, link, to, france, and, the, rest, of, europe, the, name, barcelona, comes, from, the, ancient, iberian, ba, keno, attested, in, an, ancient, coin, inscription, found, on, the, right, side, of, the, coin, in, iberian, script, as, in, ancient, greek, sources, as, barkin, n, and, in, latin, as, barcino, barcilonum, and, barcenona, other, sources, suggest, that, the, city, may, have, been, named, after, the, carthaginian, general, hamilcar, barca, who, was, supposed, to, have, founded, the, city, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, but, there, is, no, evidence, its, name, in, antiquity, barcino, was, connected, with, the, barcid, family, of, hamilcar, during, the, middle, ages, the, city, was, variously, known, as, barchinona, bar,

the, city, another, common, abbreviation, is, bcn, which, is, also, the, iata, airport, code, of, the, barcelona, el, prat, airport, the, city, is, referred, to, as, the, ciutat, comtal, in, catalan, and, ciudad, condal, in, spanish, i, e, comital, city, or, city, of, counts, owing, to, its, past, as, the, seat, of, the, count, of, barcelona, the, origin, of, the, earliest, settlement, at, the, site, of, present, day, barcelona, is, unclear, the, ruins, of, an, early, settlement, have, been, found, including, different, tombs, and, dwellings, dating, to, earlier, than, 5000, bc, in, greek, mythology, the, founding, of, barcelona, had, been, attributed, to, the, mythological, hercules, according, to, tradition, barcelona, was, founded, by, punic, phonecian, settlers, who, had, trading, posts, along, the, catalonian, coast, in, particular, some, historians, attribute, the, foundation, of, the, city, directly, to, the, historical, carthaginian, general, hamilcar, barca, father, of, hannibal, who, supposedly, named, the, city, barcino, after, his, family, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, but, this, theory, has, been, questioned, archeological, evidence, in, the, form, of, coins, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, have, been, found, on, the, hills, at, the, foot, of, montju, c, with, the, name, b, rkeno, written, in, an, ancient, script, in, the, iberian, language, thus, we, can, conclude, that, the, laietani, an, ancient, iberian, pre, roman, people, of, the, iberian, peninsula, who, inhabited, the, area, occupied, by, the, city, of, barcelona, around, 3, 2, bc, called, the, area, b, rkeno, which, means, the, place, of, the, plains, barrke, plains, terrace, in, about, 15, bc, the, romans, redrew, the, town, as, a, castrum, roman, military, camp, centred, on, the, mons, taber, a, little, hill, near, the, generalitat, catalan, government, and, city, hall, buildings, the, roman, forum, at, the, crossing, of, the, cardo, maximus, and, decumanus, maximus, was, approximately, placed, where, current, pla, a, de, sant, jaume, is, thus, the, political, centre, of, the, city, catalonia, and, its, domains, has, remained, in, the, same, place, for, over, 2, 000, years, under, the, romans, it, was, a, colony, with, the, surname, of, faventia, or, in, full, colonia, faventia, julia, augusta, pia, barcino, or, colonia, julia, augusta, faventia, paterna, barcino, pomponius, mela, mentions, it, among, the, small, towns, of, the, district, probably, as, it, was, eclipsed, by, its, neighbour, tarraco, modern, tarragona, but, it, may, be, gathered, from, later, writers, that, it, gradually, grew, in, wealth, and, consequence, favoured, as, it, was, with, a, beautiful, situation, and, an, excellent, harbour, it, enjoyed, immunity, from, imperial, burdens, the, city, minted, its, own, coins, some, from, the, era, of, galba, survive, important, roman, vestiges, are, displayed, in, pla, a, del, rei, underground, as, a, part, of, the, barcelona, city,

few, years, the, capital, of, all, hispania, after, being, conquered, by, the, umayyads, in, the, early, 8th, century, it, was, conquered, after, a, siege, in, 801, by, charlemagne, s, son, louis, who, made, barcelona, the, seat, of, the, carolingian, hispanic, march, marca, hispanica, a, buffer, zone, ruled, by, the, count, of, barcelona, the, counts, of, barcelona, became, increasingly, independent, and, expanded, their, territory, to, include, much, of, modern, catalonia, although, in, 985, barcelona, was, sacked, by, the, army, of, almanzor, the, sack, was, so, traumatic, that, most, of, barcelona, s, population, was, either, killed, or, enslaved, in, 1137, aragon, and, the, county, of, barcelona, merged, in, dynastic, union, by, the, marriage, of, ramon, berenguer, iv, and, petronilla, of, aragon, their, titles, finally, borne, by, only, one, person, when, their, son, alfonso, ii, of, aragon, ascended, to, the, throne, in, 1162, his, territories, were, later, to, be, known, as, the, crown, of, aragon, which, conquered, many, overseas, possessions, and, ruled, the, western, mediterranean, sea, with, outlying, territories, in, naples, and, sicily, and, as, far, as, athens, in, the, 13th, century, barcelona, was, the, leading, slave, trade, centre, of, the, crown, of, aragon, up, until, the, 15th, century, when, it, was, eclipsed, by, valencia, it, initially, fed, from, eastern, and, balkan, slave, stock, later, drawing, from, a, maghribian, and, ultimately, subsaharan, pool, of, slaves, the, bank, or, taula, de, canvi, de, barcelona, often, viewed, as, the, oldest, public, bank, in, europe, was, established, by, the, city, magistrates, in, 1401, it, originated, from, necessities, of, the, state, as, did, the, bank, of, venice, 1402, and, the, bank, of, genoa, 1407, the, marriage, of, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castile, in, 1469, united, the, two, royal, lines, madrid, became, the, centre, of, political, power, whilst, the, colonization, of, the, americas, reduced, the, financial, importance, at, least, in, relative, terms, of, mediterranean, trade, barcelona, was, a, centre, of, catalan, separatism, including, the, catalan, revolt, 1640, 52, against, philip, iv, of, spain, the, great, plague, of, 1650, 1654, halved, the, city, s, population, in, the, 18th, century, a, fortress, was, built, at, montju, c, that, overlooked, the, harbour, in, 1794, this, fortress, was, used, by, the, french, astronomer, pierre, fran, ois, andr, m, chain, for, observations, relating, to, a, survey, stretching, to, dunkirk, that, provided, the, official, basis, of, the, measurement, of, a, metre, the, definitive, metre, bar, manufactured, from, platinum, was, presented, to, the, french, legislative, assembly, on, 22, june, 1799, much, of, barcelona, was, negatively, affected, by, the, napoleonic, wars, but, the, start, of, industrialization, saw, the, fortunes, of, the, province, improve, in, the, mid, 1850s, barcelona, was, struggling, with, population, density, as, it, became, an, industrial, port, city, and, european, capital, the, city, s, density, was, at, 856, people, per, hectare, more, than, double, that, of, paris, mortality, rates, were, on, the, rise, and, any, outbreaks, of, disease, would, devastate, the, population, to, solve, the, issue, a, civil, engineer, named, ildefons, cerd, proposed, a, plan, for, a, new, district, known, as, the, eixample, the, citizens, of, barcelona, had, begun, to, demolish, the, medieval, wall, surrounding, and, constricting, the, city, cerd, thought, it, best, to, transform, the, land, outside, the, walls, into, an, area, characterized, by, a, scientific, approach, to, urbanization, his, proposal, consisted, of, a, grid, of, streets, to, unite, the, old, city, and, surrounding, villages, there, would, also, be, wide, streets, to, allow, people, to, breathe, clean, air, gardens, in, the, centre, of, each, street, block, integration, of, rich, and, poor, giving, both, groups, access, to, the, same, services, and, smooth, flowing, traffic, urban, quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and, efficiency, were, all, major, keys, for, cerd, s, vision, not, everything, he, imagined, would, be, realized, within, the, eixample, district, but, the, iconic, octagonal, superblocks, with, chamfered, corners, for, better, visibility, are, his, direct, brainchild, and, remain, immensely, helpful, even, 170, years, later, the, district, and, its, ideals, were, not, appreciated, at, the, time, the, city, council, awarded, the, design, of, the, extension, plan, to, another, architect, the, spanish, government, was, the, one, to, step, in, and, impose, cerd, s, plan, laying, the, groundwork, for, many, more, tensions, between, the, spanish, and, catalan, administrations, regardless, some, of, the, upper, class, citizens, of, barcelona, were, excited, by, the, new, plan, and, began, a, race, to, build, the, biggest, tallest, most, attractive, house, in, the, district, their, interest, and, money, fueled, the, rich, diversity, that, we, now, see, in, the, district, s, architecture, in, the, end, cerd, s, ideas, would, have, a, lasting, impact, on, barcelona, s, development, earning, it, international, recognition, for, its, highly, efficient, approach, to, urban, planning, and, design, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, city, and, catalonia, in, general, were, resolutely, republican, many, enterprises, and, public, services, were, collectivized, by, the, cnt, and, ugt, unions, as, the, power, of, the, republican, government, and, the, generalitat, diminished, much, of, the, city, was, under, the, effective, control, of, anarchist, groups, the, anarchists, lost, control, of, the, city, to, their, own, allies, the, communists, and, official, government, troops, after, the, street, fighting, of, the, barcelona, may, days, the, fall, of, the, city, on, 26, january, 1939, caused, a, mass, exodus, of, civilians, who, fled, to, the, french, border, the, resistance, of, barcelona, to, franco, s, coup, d, tat, was, to, have, lasting, effects, after, the, defeat, of, the, republican, government, the, autonomous, institutions, of, catalonia, were, abolished, and, the, use, of, the, catalan, language, in, public, life, was, suppressed, barcelona, remained, the, second, largest, city, in, spain, at, the, heart, of, a, region, which, was, relatively, industrialized, and, prosperous, despite, the, devastation, of, the, civil, war, the, result, was, a, large, scale, immigration, from, poorer, regions, of, spain, particularly, andalusia, murcia, and, galicia, which, in, turn, led, to, rapid, urbanization, in, 1992, barcelona, hosted, the, summer, olympics, the, after, effects, of, this, are, credited, with, driving, major, changes, in, what, had, up, until, then, been, a, largely, industrial, city, as, part, of, the, preparation, for, the, games, industrial, buildings, along, the, sea, front, were, demolished, and, 3, km, 2, mi, of, beach, were, created, new, construction, increased, the, road, capacity, of, the, city, by, 17, the, sewage, handling, capacity, by, 27, and, the, amount, of, new, green, areas, and, beaches, by, 78, between, 1990, and, 2004, the, number, of, hotel, rooms, in, the, city, doubled, perhaps, more, importantly, the, outside, perception, of, the, city, was, changed, making, by, 2012, barcelona, the, 12th, most, popular, city, destination, in, the, world, and, the, 5th, amongst, european, cities, the, death, of, franco, in, 1975, brought, on, a, period, of, democratization, throughout, spain, pressure, for, change, was, particularly, strong, in, barcelona, which, considered, that, it, had, been, punished, during, nearly, forty, years, of, francoism, for, its, support, of, the, republican, government, massive, but, peaceful, demonstrations, on, 11, september, 1977, assembled, over, a, million, people, in, the, streets, of, barcelona, to, call, for, the, restoration, of, catalan, autonomy, it, was, granted, less, than, a, month, later, the, development, of, barcelona, was, promoted, by, two, events, in, 1986, spanish, accession, to, the, european, community, and, particularly, barcelona, s, designation, as, host, city, of, the, 1992, summer, olympics, the, process, of, urban, regeneration, has, been, rapid, and, accompanied, by, a, greatly, increased, international, reputation, of, the, city, as, a, tourist, destination, the, increased, cost, of, housing, has, led, to, a, slight, decline, 16, 6, in, the, population, over, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, as, many, families, move, out, into, the, suburbs, this, decline, has, been, reversed, since, 2001, as, a, new, wave, of, immigration, particularly, from, latin, america, and, from, morocco, has, gathered, pace, in, 1987, an, eta, car, bombing, at, hipercor, killed, 21, people, on, 17, august, 2017, a, van, was, driven, into, pedestrians, on, la, rambla, killing, 14, and, injuring, at, least, 100, one, of, whom, later, died, other, attacks, took, place, elsewhere, in, catalonia, the, prime, minister, of, spain,

and, later, protests, in, july, 2023, barcelona, was, announced, as, the, unesco, uia, world, capital, of, architecture, for, the, 2024, 2026, term, this, means, it, will, be, the, hub, for,
