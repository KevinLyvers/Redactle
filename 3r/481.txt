botswana, officially, the, republic, of, botswana, is, a, landlocked, country, in, southern, africa, botswana, is, topographically, flat, with, approximately, 70, per, cent, of, its, territory, part, of, the, kalahari, desert, it, is, bordered, by, south, africa, to, the, south, and, southeast, namibia, to, the, west, and, north, zambia, to, the, north, and, zimbabwe, to, the, northeast, with, a, population, of, slightly, over, 2, 4, million, people, and, a, land, area, similar, to, france, botswana, is, one, of, the, most, sparsely, populated, countries, in, the, world, it, is, essentially, the, nation, state, of, the, tswana, people, who, constitute, nearly, 80, per, cent, of, the, population, the, tswana, ethnic, group, are, descended, mainly, from, bantu, speaking, peoples, who, migrated, into, southern, africa, including, modern, botswana, in, several, waves, before, ad, 600, in, 1885, the, british, colonised, the, area, and, declared, a, protectorate, named, bechuanaland, as, part, of, the, decolonisation, of, africa, bechuanaland, became, an, independent, commonwealth, republic, under, its, current, name, on, 30, september, 1966, since, then, it, has, been, a, parliamentary, republic, with, a, consistent, record, of, uninterrupted, democratic, elections, although, the, botswana, democratic, party, has, been, the, only, ruling, party, from, independence, until, 2024, as, of, 2024, botswana, is, the, third, least, corrupt, country, in, africa, according, to, the, corruption, perceptions, index, published, by, transparency, international, the, economy, is, dominated, by, mining, and, tourism, botswana, has, a, gdp, purchasing, power, parity, per, capita, of, about, 20, 158, as, of, 2024, botswana, is, the, world, s, biggest, diamond, producing, country, its, relatively, high, gross, national, income, per, capita, by, some, estimates, the, fourth, largest, in, africa, gives, the, country, a, relatively, high, standard, of, living, and, the, second, highest, human, development, index, of, continental, sub, saharan, africa, after, south, africa, botswana, is, a, member, of, the, southern, african, customs, union, the, southern, african, development, community, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, the, united, nations, the, country, s, name, means, land, of, the, tswana, referring, to, the, dominant, ethnic, group, in, botswana, the, constitution, of, botswana, recognizes, a, homogeneous, tswana, state, the, demonym, batswana, was, originally, applied, to, the, tswana, and, has, also, come, to, be, used, generally, as, a, term, for, all, citizens, of, botswana, it, is, estimated, that, hominids, lived, in, botswana, during, the, pleistocene, stone, tools, and, animal, remains, indicate, that, all, areas, of, the, country, were, inhabited, at, least, 400, 000, years, ago, it, was, claimed, to, have, been, the, birthplace, of, all, modern, humans, from, around, 200, 000, years, ago, evidence, left, by, modern, humans, such, as, cave, paintings, is, about, 73, 000, years, old, the, earliest, known, inhabitants, of, southern, africa, are, thought, to, have, been, the, forebears, of, present, day, san, bushmen, and, khoi, peoples, both, groups, speak, click, languages, from, the, small, khoe, kwadi, kx, a, and, tuu, families, whose, members, hunted, gathered, and, traded, over, long, distances, when, cattle, were, first, introduced, about, 2000, years, ago, into, southern, africa, pastoralism, became, a, major, feature, of, the, economy, since, the, region, had, large, grasslands, free, of, tsetse, flies, it, is, unclear, when, bantu, speaking, peoples, first, moved, into, the, country, from, the, north, although, ad, 600, seems, to, be, a, consensus, estimate, in, that, era, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, day, kalanga, moved, into, what, is, now, the, north, eastern, area, of, the, country, these, proto, kalanga, were, closely, connected, to, states, in, zimbabwe, as, well, as, to, the, mapungubwe, state, and, the, notable, of, these, was, domboshaba, ruins, a, cultural, and, heritage, site, in, botswana, initially, occupied, towards, the, end, of, the, great, zimbabwe, period, 1250, 1450, with, stone, walls, that, have, an, average, height, of, 1, 8, metres, the, site, is, a, respected, place, for, the, people, living, in, the, region, and, it, is, believed, that, the, chief, lived, on, the, top, of, the, hill, with, his, helpers, or, assistants, these, states, located, outside, of, current, botswana, s, borders, appear, to, have, kept, massive, herds, of, cattle, in, what, is, now, the, central, district, apparently, at, numbers, approaching, modern, cattle, density, this, massive, cattle, raising, complex, prospered, until, 1300, or, so, and, seems, to, have, regressed, following, the, collapse, of, mapungubwe, during, this, era, the, first, tswana, speaking, groups, the, bakgalagadi, moved, into, the, southern, areas, of, the, kalahari, all, these, various, peoples, were, connected, to, trade, routes, that, ran, via, the, limpopo, river, to, the, indian, ocean, and, trade, goods, from, asia, such, as, beads, made, their, way, to, botswana, most, likely, in, exchange, for, ivory, gold, and, rhinoceros, horn, toutswemogala, hill, iron, age, settlement, s, radio, carbon, dates, for, this, settlement, range, from, the, 7th, to, late, 19th, century, indicating, occupation, of, more, than, one, thousand, years, the, hill, was, part, of, the, formation, of, early, states, in, southern, africa, with, cattle, keeping, as, a, major, source, of, economy, toutswe, settlement, includes, house, floors, large, heaps, of, vitrified, cow, dung, and, burials, while, the, outstanding, structure, is, the, stone, wall, around, 1000, ad, the, toutswe, people, moved, into, botswana, however, agriculture, also, played, a, vital, role, in, the, longevity, of, toutswemogala, hill, s, extended, occupation, as, many, grain, storage, structures, have, also, been, found, on, the, site, many, different, stratified, layers, of, housing, floors, further, signal, continuous, occupation, over, hundreds, of, years, the, arrival, of, the, ancestors, of, the, tswana, speakers, who, came, to, control, the, region, has, yet, to, be, dated, precisely, members, of, the, bakwena, a, chieftaincy, under, a, leader, named, kgabo, ii, made, their, way, into, the, southern, kalahari, by, ad, 1500, at, the, latest, and, his, people, drove, the, bakgalagadi, inhabitants, west, into, the, desert, over, the, years, several, offshoots, of, the, bakwena, moved, into, adjoining, territories, the, bangwaketse, occupied, areas, to, the, west, while, the, bangwato, moved, northeast, into, formerly, kalanga, areas, not, long, afterwards, a, bangwato, offshoot, known, as, the, batawana, migrated, into, the, okavango, delta, probably, in, the, 1790s, the, first, written, records, relating, to, modern, day, botswana, appear, in, 1824, what, these, records, show, is, that, the, bangwaketse, had, become, the, predominant, power, in, the, region, under, the, rule, of, makaba, ii, the, bangwaketse, kept, vast, herds, of, cattle, in, well, protected, desert, areas, and, used, their, military, prowess, to, raid, their, neighbours, other, chiefdoms, in, the, area, by, this, time, had, capitals, of, 10, 000, or, so, and, were, fairly, prosperous, this, equilibrium, came, to, end, during, the, mfecane, period, 1823, 1843, when, a, succession, of, invading, peoples, from, south, africa, entered, the, country, although, the, bangwaketse, were, able, to, defeat, the, invading, bakololo, in, 1826, over, time, all, the, major, chiefdoms, in, botswana, were, attacked, weakened, and, impoverished, the, bakololo, and, amandebele, raided, repeatedly, and, took, large, numbers, of, cattle, women, and, children, from, the, batswana, most, of, whom, were, driven, into, the, desert, or, sanctuary, areas, such, as, hilltops, and, caves, only, after, 1843, when, the, amandebele, moved, into, western, zimbabwe, did, this, threat, subside, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, trade, with, cape, colony, based, merchants, opened, up, and, enabled, the, batswana, chiefdoms, to, rebuild, the, bakwena, bangwaketse, bangwato, and, batawana, cooperated, to, control, the, lucrative, ivory, trade, and, then, used, the, proceeds, to, import, horses, and, guns, which, in, turn, enabled, them, to, establish, control, over, what, is, now, botswana, this, process, was, largely, complete, by, 1880, and, thus, the, bushmen, the, kalanga, the, bakgalagadi, and, other, current, minorities, were, subjugated, by, the, batswana, following, the, great, trek, afrikaners, from, the, cape, colony, established, themselves, on, the, borders, of, botswana, in, the, transvaal, in, 1852, a, coalition, of, tswana, chiefdoms, led, by, sechele, i, defeated, afrikaner, incursions, at, the, battle, of, dimawe, and, after, about, eight, years, of, intermittent, tensions, and, hostilities, eventually, came, to, a, peace, agreement, in, potchefstroom, in, 1860, from, that, point, on, the, modern, day, border, between, south, africa, and, botswana, was, agreed, on, and, the, afrikaners, and, batswana, traded, and, worked, together, comparatively, peacefully, in, 1884, batawana, a, northern, based, tswana, clan, s, cavalry, under, the, command, of, kgosi, moremi, fought, and, defeated, the, ndebele, s, invasion, of, northern, botswana, at, the, battle, of, khutiyabasadi, this, is, the, start, of, the, collapse, of, the, ndebele, kingdom, in, zimbabwe, and, helped, the, tswana, speaking, authority, due, to, newly, peaceful, conditions, trade, thrived, between, 1860, and, 1880, taking, advantage, of, this, were, christian, missionaries, the, lutherans, and, the, london, missionary, society, both, became, established, in, the, country, by, 1856, by, 1880, every, major, village, had, a, resident, missionary, and, their, influence, slowly, became, felt, khama, iii, reigned, 1875, 1923, was, the, first, of, the, tswana, chiefs, to, make, christianity, a, state, religion, and, changed, a, great, deal, of, tswana, customary, law, as, a, result, christianity, became, the, de, facto, official, religion, in, all, the, chiefdoms, by, world, war, i, during, the, scramble, for, africa, the, territory, of, botswana, was, coveted, by, both, the, german, empire, and, britain, during, the, berlin, conference, britain, decided, to, annex, botswana, in, order, to, safeguard, the, road, to, the, north, and, thus, connect, the, cape, colony, to, its, territories, further, north, it, unilaterally, annexed, tswana, territories, in, january, 1885, and, then, sent, the, warren, expedition, north, to, consolidate, control, over, the, area, and, convince, the, chiefs, to, accept, british, overrule, despite, their, misgivings, they, eventually, acquiesced, to, this, fait, accompli, in, 1890, areas, north, of, 22, degrees, were, added, to, the, new, bechuanaland, protectorate, during, the, 1890s, the, new, territory, was, divided, into, eight, different, reserves, with, fairly, small, amounts, of, land, being, left, as, freehold, for, white, settlers, during, the, early, 1890s, the, british, government, decided, to, hand, over, the, bechuanaland, protectorate, to, the, british, south, africa, company, this, plan, which, was, well, on, its, way, to, fruition, despite, the, entreaties, of, tswana, leaders, who, toured, england, in, protest, was, eventually, foiled, by, the, failure, of, the, jameson, raid, in, january, 1896, when, the, union, of, south, africa, was, formed, in, 1910, from, the, main, british, colonies, in, the, region, the, high, commission, territories, the, bechuanaland, protectorate, basutoland, now, lesotho, and, swaziland, now, eswatini, were, not, included, but, provision, was, made, for, their, later, incorporation, however, the, uk, began, to, consult, with, their, inhabitants, as, to, their, wishes, although, successive, south, african, governments, sought, to, have, the, territories, transferred, to, their, jurisdiction, the, uk, kept, delaying, consequently, it, never, occurred, the, election, of, the, nationalist, government, in, 1948, which, instituted, apartheid, and, south, africa, s, withdrawal, from, the, commonwealth, in, 1961, ended, any, prospect, of, the, uk, or, these, territories, agreeing, to, incorporation, into, south, africa, an, expansion, of, british, central, authority, and, the, evolution, of, native, government, resulted, in, the, 1920, establishment, of, two, advisory, councils, to, represent, both, africans, and, europeans, the, african, council, consisted, of, the, eight, heads, of, the, tswana, tribes, and, some, elected, members, proclamations, in, 1934, regulated, tribal, rule, and, powers, a, european, african, advisory, council, was, formed, in, 1951, and, the, 1961, constitution, established, a, consultative, legislative, council, in, june, 1964, the, united, kingdom, accepted, proposals, for, a, democratic, self, government, in, botswana, an, independence, conference, was, held, in, london, in, february, 1966, the, seat, of, government, was, moved, in, 1965, from, mahikeng, in, south, africa, to, the, newly, established, gaborone, which, is, located, near, botswana, s, border, with, south, africa, based, on, the, 1965, constitution, the, country, held, its, first, general, elections, under, universal, suffrage, and, gained, independence, on, 30,
