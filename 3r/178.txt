quthing, the, orange, river, from, afrikaans, dutch, oranjerivier, is, a, river, in, southern, africa, it, is, the, longest, river, in, south, africa, with, a, total, length, of, 2, 432, km, 1, 511, mi, the, orange, river, basin, extends, from, lesotho, into, south, africa, and, namibia, to, the, north, it, rises, in, the, drakensberg, mountains, in, lesotho, flowing, westwards, through, south, africa, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, river, forms, part, of, the, international, borders, between, south, africa, and, lesotho, and, between, south, africa, and, namibia, as, well, as, several, provincial, borders, within, south, africa, except, for, upington, it, does, not, pass, through, any, major, cities, the, orange, river, plays, an, important, role, in, the, south, african, economy, by, providing, water, for, irrigation, and, hydroelectric, power, the, river, was, named, the, orange, river, in, honour, of, the, dutch, ruling, family, the, house, of, orange, by, the, dutch, explorer, robert, jacob, gordon, other, names, include, simply, the, word, for, river, in, khoekhoegowab, orthography, written, as, garib, which, is, rendered, in, afrikaans, as, gariep, river, with, the, intrusion, of, a, velar, fricative, in, place, of, the, alveolar, click, groote, river, derived, from, kai, garib, or, senqu, river, used, in, lesotho, derived, from, n, black, it, is, known, in, isizulu, as, isangqu, the, orange, rises, in, the, drakensberg, mountains, along, the, border, between, south, africa, and, lesotho, about, 193, km, 120, mi, west, of, the, indian, ocean, and, at, an, altitude, of, over, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, the, extremity, of, the, orange, river, inside, lesotho, is, known, as, the, senqu, parts, of, the, senqu, river, freeze, in, winter, because, of, the, high, altitude, this, creates, droughts, downstream, which, mainly, affect, goat, and, cattle, production, the, orange, river, then, runs, westward, through, south, africa, forming, the, south, western, boundary, of, the, free, state, province, in, this, section, the, river, flows, first, into, the, gariep, dam, and, later, into, the, vanderkloof, dam, from, the, border, of, lesotho, to, below, the, vanderkloof, dam, the, river, bed, is, deeply, incised, further, downstream, the, land, is, flatter, and, the, river, is, used, extensively, for, irrigation, at, the, western, point, of, the, free, state, southwest, of, kimberley, the, orange, meets, with, its, main, tributary, the, vaal, river, which, forms, much, of, the, northern, border, of, the, province, from, here, the, river, flows, further, westward, through, the, arid, wilderness, of, the, southern, kalahari, region, and, namaqualand, in, the, northern, cape, province, to, meet, with, namibia, at, 20, e, longitude, from, here, it, flows, westward, for, 550, km, 340, mi, forming, the, international, border, between, the, province, and, namibia, s, karas, region, on, the, border, the, river, passes, the, town, of, vioolsdrif, the, main, border, post, between, south, africa, and, namibia, in, the, last, 800, km, 500, mi, of, its, course, the, orange, receives, many, intermittent, streams, and, several, large, wadis, lead, into, it, in, this, section, the, namib, desert, terminates, on, the, north, bank, of, the, river, so, under, normal, circumstances, the, volume, of, water, added, by, these, tributaries, is, negligible, here, the, bed, of, the, river, is, once, again, deeply, incised, the, augrabies, falls, are, located, on, this, section, of, the, orange, where, the, river, descends, 122, m, 400, ft, in, a, course, of, 26, km, 16, mi, the, orange, empties, into, the, atlantic, ocean, between, the, small, towns, of, oranjemund, meaning, orange, mouth, in, namibia, and, alexander, bay, in, south, africa, about, equidistant, between, walvis, bay, and, cape, town, some, 33, km, 21, mi, from, its, mouth, it, is, obstructed, by, rapids, and, sand, bars, and, is, generally, not, navigable, for, long, stretches, the, river, has, a, total, length, of, 2, 432, km, 1, 511, mi, in, the, dry, season, the, volume, of, the, water, in, the, river, is, considerably, reduced, because, of, the, rapid, run, off, and, evaporation, at, the, source, of, the, orange, the, rainfall, is, about, 2, 000, mm, 79, in, per, annum, but, precipitation, decreases, as, the, river, flows, westward, at, its, mouth, the, rainfall, is, less, than, 50, mm, 2, 0, in, per, year, the, factors, that, support, evaporation, though, tend, to, increase, in, a, westerly, direction, in, the, wet, season, summer, the, orange, river, becomes, a, brown, coloured, torrent, the, huge, mass, of, sediment, carried, constitutes, a, long, term, threat, to, engineering, projects, on, the, river, the, total, catchment, of, the, orange, river, including, the, vaal, extends, over, 973, 000, km, 2, 376, 000, sq, mi, i, e, equivalent, to, about, 77, of, the, land, area, of, south, africa, 1, 221, 037, km, 2, 471, 445, sq, mi, around, 366, 000, km, 2, 141, 000, sq, mi, 38, however, are, situated, outside, the, country, in, lesotho, botswana, and, namibia, some, of, the, earliest, precolonial, inhabitants, called, the, river, n, arib, referring, to, its, black, colour, or, sometimes, just, kai, arib, great, river, from, which, is, derived, the, afrikaans, version, gariep, and, translation, groote, rivier, the, early, dutch, name, for, the, river, was, just, that, translation, groote, rivier, meaning, great, river, the, river, was, named, the, orange, river, by, colonel, robert, gordon, commander, of, the, united, east, india, company, voc, garrison, at, cape, town, on, a, trip, to, the, interior, in, 1779, gordon, named, the, river, in, honor, of, william, v, of, orange, a, popular, but, incorrect, belief, is, that, the, river, was, named, after, the, supposedly, orange, color, of, its, water, as, opposed, to, the, color, of, its, tributary, the, vaal, river, which, name, is, derived, from, the, name, hai, arib, pale, river, vaal, being, afrikaans, for, pale, or, grey, since, the, end, of, apartheid, the, name, gariep, has, had, greater, favour, in, official, correspondence, in, south, africa, although, the, name, orange, has, greater, international, recognition, in, lesotho, where, the, river, rises, it, is, known, as, the, senqu, river, derived, from, the, original, khoemana, name, the, eastern, cape, geographical, names, committee, has, advertised, its, intention, to, consider, a, name, change, from, the, colonial, name, for, that, portion, of, the, river, that, forms, the, border, between, the, eastern, cape, and, the, free, state, with, suggestions, being, igqili, or, senqu, the, advertisement, placed, in, the, aliwal, weekblad, newspaper, states, that, the, present, name, is, perceived, to, have, a, strong, association, with, the, history, of, colonial, subjugation, and, has, therefore, no, place, under, the, current, democratic, dispensation, in, south, african, folklore, the, orange, river, is, often, associated, with, the, grootslang, a, mythical, being, resembling, a, giant, serpent, which, is, often, connected, to, the, river, s, alluvial, diamonds, the, grootslang, is, described, as, living, in, a, gem, filled, cave, connected, to, the, orange, river, by, a, natural, pipe, through, which, the, diamonds, gradually, enter, the, river, other, sites, said, to, be, lairs, of, the, creature, include, the, pool, beneath, the, king, george, cataract, at, aughrabies, falls, which, is, also, said, to, be, a, source, of, diamonds, and, a, large, rock, in, the, middle, of, the, river, itself, in, this, version, of, the, legend, the, grootslang, is, also, said, to, prey, on, cattle, from, the, river, s, banks, as, the, collection, point, for, the, majority, of, south, africa, s, water, the, orange, river, plays, a, major, role, in, supporting, agriculture, industry, and, mining, to, assist, in, this, two, large, water, schemes, have, been, created, the, orange, river, project, and, the, lesotho, highlands, water, project, historically, the, river, played, an, important, role, in, the, south, african, diamond, rush, with, the, first, diamonds, in, the, country, being, discovered, in, alluvial, deposits, on, the, orange, today, several, commercial, diamond, mines, operate, along, the, final, stretch, of, the, orange, river, and, around, its, mouth, because, of, the, lack, of, dangerous, animals, and, high, water, levels, during, summer, the, river, is, used, for, recreational, canoeing, and, rafting, orange, river, rafting, has, become, very, popular, with, many, companies, using, their, camps, along, the, river, from, which, to, operate, the, most, popular, trips, are, four, day, and, six, day, river, trips, that, take, place, either, along, the, gorge, below, the, augrabies, falls, or, along, the, richtersveld, area, the, orange, river, project, orp, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, imaginative, projects, of, its, kind, in, south, africa, it, was, constructed, by, hendrik, verwoerd, s, government, at, the, height, of, the, apartheid, era, the, orp, was, built, to, exploit, the, waters, of, the, orange, river, which, without, the, vaal, river, represents, some, 14, 1, of, the, total, runoff, in, south, africa, and, in, the, process, to, satisfy, an, increasing, demand, for, water, the, main, objectives, of, the, project, were, the, gariep, dam, near, colesberg, is, the, main, storage, structure, within, the, orange, river, from, here, the, water, is, supplied, in, two, directions, westward, along, the, orange, river, via, hydroelectric, power, generators, to, the, vanderkloof, dam, and, southward, through, the, orange, fish, tunnel, to, the, eastern, cape, eskom, operates, hydroelectric, power, stations, at, both, the, gariep, dam, and, the, vanderkloof, dam, the, hydroelectric, power, station, at, the, vanderkloof, dam, was, the, first, power, generation, station, in, south, africa, situated, entirely, underground, the, towns, oviston, and, oranjekrag, were, established, to, facilitate, the, construction, and, operation, of, the, new, infrastructure, irrigation, in, the, vast, area, downstream, of, the, vanderkloof, dam, which, has, turned, thousands, of, hectares, of, arid, veld, into, highly, productive, agricultural, land, was, made, possible, by, the, construction, of, the, gariep, and, vanderkloof, dams, old, established, irrigation, schemes, such, as, those, at, buchuberg, upington, kakamas, and, vioolsdrif, have, also, benefitted, because, regulation, of, the, flow, is, now, possible, on, the, namibian, side, of, the, river, aussenkehr, produces, grapes, with, the, help, of, water, from, the, orange, in, recent, years, the, wine, producing, areas, along, the, orange, river, have, grown, in, importance, irrigation, in, the, eastern, cape, has, also, received, a, tremendous, boost, not, only, from, the, additional, water, being, made, available, but, also, owing, to, improvement, in, water, quality, without, this, improvement, the, citrus, farmers, along, the, lower, sundays, river, would, almost, certainly, have, continued, to, suffer, losses, of, productivity, the, lesotho, highlands, water, project, was, conceived, to, supplement, the, water, supply, in, the, vaal, river, system, water, is, delivered, to, south, africa, by, means, of, the, delivery, tunnel, which, passes, under, the, lesotho, south, africa, border, at, the, caledon, river, and, then, under, the, little, caledon, river, south, of, clarens, in, the, free, state, and, discharges, into, the, ash, river, about, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, further, to, the, north, the, scheme, became, viable, when, water, demands, in, gauteng, reached, levels, that, could, no, longer, be, supported, economically, by, alternative, schemes, such, as, the, tugela, river, vaal, river, pumped, storage, scheme, which, used, the, sterkfontein, dam, located, near, harrismith, in, the, free, state, in, 1867, the, first, diamond, discovered, in, south, africa, the, eureka, diamond, was, found, near, hopetown, on, the, orange, river, two, years, later, a, much, larger, diamond, known, as, the, star, of, south, africa, was, found, in, the, same, area, causing, a, diamond, rush, this, was, soon, eclipsed, by, the, diamond, rush, to, mine, diamonds, directly, from, kimberlite, at, kimberley, in, 1871, although, alluvial, diamonds, continued, to, be, found, in, the, orange, today, several, commercial, diamond, mines, operate, on, the, last, stretch, of, the, river, as, well, as, the, beaches, around, its, mouth, diamond, mines, also, operate, on, the, middle, stretch, of, the, river, during, the, temperate, months, of, march, and, april, given, good, rains, and, the, sluices, of, the, dams, being, open, a, canoeist, or, rafter, can, easily, travel, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, per, day, the, lower, reaches, of, the, river, are, most, popular, because, of, the, spectacular, topography, commercial, tours, are, available, and, these, expeditions, depart, from, the, border, town, of, vioolsdrif, the, orange, river, has, no, large, animals, it, lies, outside, the, range, of, the, nile, crocodile, and, although, hippopotami, were, once, abundant, they, were, hunted, to, extermination, in, the, 19th, century, the, orange, river, has, a, relative, paucity, of, species, diversity, surveys, from, 1995, to, 2001, in, the, lower, orange, river, found, 19, different, fish, species, from, eight, different, families, the, two, non, native, species, recorded, in, the, surveys, were, cyprinus, carpio, and, oreochromis, mossambicus, the, latter, of, which, had, increased, rapidly, in, abundance, since, the, early, 1980s, another, exotic, species, rainbow, trout, is, found, in, the, river, headwaters, in, lesotho, seven, species, are, endemic, to, the, vaal, orange, river, system
