the, apennines, or, apennine, mountains, p, n, a, n, ap, nyne, greek, or, latin, appenninus, or, apenninus, mons, a, singular, with, plural, meaning, italian, appennini, are, a, mountain, range, consisting, of, parallel, smaller, chains, extending, c, 1, 200, km, 750, mi, along, the, length, of, peninsular, italy, in, the, northwest, they, join, with, the, ligurian, alps, at, altare, in, the, southwest, they, end, at, reggio, di, calabria, the, coastal, city, at, the, tip, of, the, peninsula, since, 2000, the, environment, ministry, of, italy, following, the, recommendations, of, the, apennines, park, of, europe, project, has, been, defining, the, apennines, system, to, include, the, mountains, of, north, sicily, for, a, total, distance, of, 1, 500, kilometres, 930, mi, the, system, forms, an, arc, enclosing, the, east, side, of, the, ligurian, and, tyrrhenian, seas, the, apennines, conserve, some, intact, ecosystems, that, have, survived, human, intervention, in, these, are, some, of, the, best, preserved, forests, and, montane, grasslands, in, europe, now, protected, by, national, parks, and, within, them, a, high, diversity, of, flora, and, fauna, these, mountains, are, one, of, the, last, refuges, of, the, big, european, predators, such, as, the, italian, wolf, and, the, marsican, brown, bear, now, extinct, in, the, rest, of, central, europe, the, mountains, lend, their, name, to, the, apennine, peninsula, that, forms, the, major, part, of, italy, they, are, mostly, verdant, although, one, side, of, the, highest, peak, corno, grande, is, partially, covered, by, calderone, glacier, the, only, glacier, in, the, apennines, the, eastern, slopes, down, to, the, adriatic, sea, are, steep, while, the, western, slopes, form, foothills, on, which, most, of, peninsular, italy, s, cities, are, located, the, mountains, tend, to, be, named, from, the, province, or, provinces, in, which, they, are, located, for, example, the, ligurian, apennines, are, in, liguria, the, etymology, most, frequently, repeated, because, of, its, semantic, appropriateness, is, that, it, derives, from, the, celtic, penn, mountain, summit, a, penn, inus, which, could, have, been, assigned, during, the, celtic, domination, of, north, italy, in, the, 4th, century, bc, or, before, the, name, originally, applied, to, the, north, apennines, however, historical, linguists, have, never, found, a, derivation, with, which, they, all, agree, wilhelm, deecke, said, its, etymology, is, doubtful, but, some, derive, it, from, the, ligurian, celtish, pen, or, ben, which, means, mountain, peak, a, large, number, of, place, names, seem, to, reflect, pen, penarrig, penbrynn, pencoid, penmon, pentir, etc, or, ben, beanach, benmore, benabuird, benan, bencruachan, etc, in, one, derivation, pen, ben, is, cognate, with, old, irish, cenn, head, but, an, original, kwen, would, be, required, which, is, typologically, not, found, in, languages, that, feature, labio, velars, windisch, and, brugmann, reconstructed, indo, european, kwi, deriving, also, the, greek, pindus, mountains, from, the, same, root, but, kwen, kwi, is, not, explained, by, any, rule, by, some, english, pin, as, well, as, pen, and, latin, pinna, or, penna, feather, in, the, sense, of, the, horn, of, the, quill, have, been, connected, to, the, name, this, view, has, the, word, originating, in, latium, inconsistently, with, the, theory, of, the, northern, origin, none, of, these, derivations, are, unquestionably, accepted, the, apennine, culture, is, a, technology, complex, in, central, and, southern, italy, from, the, italian, middle, bronze, age, 15th, 14th, centuries, bc, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, apennine, was, divided, into, proto, early, middle, and, late, sub, phases, but, now, archaeologists, prefer, to, consider, as, apennine, only, the, ornamental, pottery, style, of, the, later, phase, of, middle, bronze, age, bm3, this, phase, is, preceded, by, the, grotta, nuova, facies, central, italy, and, by, the, protoapennine, b, facies, southern, italy, and, succeeded, by, the, subapennine, facies, of, 13th, century, bronzo, recente, apennine, pottery, is, a, burnished, ware, incised, with, spirals, meanders, and, geometrical, zones, filled, with, dots, or, transverse, dashes, it, has, been, found, on, ischia, island, in, association, with, lhii, and, lhiii, pottery, and, on, lipari, in, association, with, lhiiia, pottery, which, associations, date, it, to, the, late, bronze, age, as, it, is, defined, in, greece, and, the, aegean, the, people, of, the, apennine, culture, were, alpine, cattle, herdsmen, grazing, their, animals, over, the, meadows, and, groves, of, mountainous, central, italy, they, lived, in, small, hamlets, located, in, defensible, places, on, the, move, between, summer, pastures, they, built, temporary, camps, or, lived, in, caves, and, rock, shelters, their, range, was, not, necessarily, confined, to, the, hills, their, pottery, has, been, found, on, the, capitoline, hill, in, rome, as, well, as, on, the, islands, mentioned, above, the, apennines, are, divided, into, three, sectors, northern, appennino, settentrionale, central, appennino, centrale, and, southern, appennino, meridionale, a, number, of, long, hiking, trails, wind, through, the, apennines, of, note, is, european, walking, route, e1, coming, from, northern, europe, and, traversing, the, lengths, of, the, northern, and, central, apennines, the, grand, italian, trail, begins, in, trieste, and, after, winding, through, the, alpine, arc, traverses, the, entire, apennine, system, sicily, and, sardinia, the, northern, apennines, consist, of, three, subchains, the, ligurian, appennino, ligure, tuscan, emilian, appennino, tosco, emiliano, and, umbrian, apennines, appennino, umbro, the, ligurian, apennines, border, the, ligurian, sea, in, the, gulf, of, genoa, from, about, savona, below, the, upper, bormida, river, valley, to, about, la, spezia, la,

monte, maggiorasca, at, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, the, main, and, only, feasible, overland, route, connecting, the, coastal, plain, of, liguria, to, the, north, italian, plain, runs, through, bocchetta, di, altare, it, has, always, been, of, strategic, importance, defenders, of, north, italy, have, had, to, control, it, since, ancient, times, as, the, various, fortifications, placed, there, testify, trenitalia, the, state, railway, system, highly, developed, on, the, coastal, plain, now, traverses, the, mountains, routinely, through, a, number, of, railway, tunnels, such, as, the, one, at, giovi, pass, the, southeastern, border, of, the, ligurian, apennines, is, the, fiume, magra, which, projects, into, the, tyrrhenian, sea, south, of, la, spezia, and, the, fiume, taro, which, runs, in, the, opposite, direction, to, join, the, po, the, divide, between, the, two, upper, river, valleys, is, the, cisa, pass, under, it, in, two, tunnels, runs, the, autostrada, della, cisa, between, spezia, and, parma, starting, at, cisa, pass, the, mountain, chain, turns, further, to, the, southeast, to, cross, the, peninsula, along, the, border, between, the, emilia, romagna, and, tuscany, regions, they, are, named, the, tuscan, emilian, apennines, west, of, the, futa, pass, and, the, tuscan, romagnol, apennines, east, of, it, or, just, the, tuscan, apennines, they, extend, to, the, upper, tiber, river, the, highest, point, is, monte, cimone, at, 2, 165, m, 7, 103, ft, a, separate, branch, the, apuan, alps, goes, southwest, bordering, the, coast, south, of, la, spezia, whether, they, are, to, be, considered, part, of, the, apennines, is, a, matter, of, opinion, certainly, they, are, part, of, the, apennine, system, topographically, only, the, valley, of, the, river, serchio, which, running, parallel, to, the, coast, turns, and, exits, into, the, tyrrhenian, sea, north, of, pisa, separates, the, apuan, alps, from, the, apennines, geologically, the, rock, is, of, a, slightly, different, composition, marble, the, roman, marble, industry, was, centered, at, luna, and, is, now, active, in, carrara, as, the, tuscan, apennines, divide, the, peninsula, between, the, po, valley, and, the, plains, and, hills, of, tuscany, and, lazio, transportation, over, them, has, been, used, to, achieve, political, and, economic, unity, historically, the, romans, used, the, via, flaminia, between, rome, and, rimini, the, montane, distance, between, florence, in, tuscany, and, bologna, in, emilia, romagna, is, shorter, but, exploitation, of, it, required, the, conquest, of, more, rugged, terrain, which, was, not, feasible, for, the, ancients, railway, lines, were, constructed, over, the, mountains, in, the, early, 19th, century, but, they, were, of, low, capacity, and, unimprovable, since, 1856, a, series, of, tunnels, have, been, constructed, to, conduct, the, bologna, florence, rail, line, which, is, neither, a, single, line, nor, a, single, tunnel, the, porrettana, line, went, into, service, in, 1864, the, direttissima, in, 1934, and, the, high, speed, in, 1996, a, few, dozen, tunnels, support, the, three, of, them, the, longest, on, the, high, speed, line, being, the, voglia, tunnel, at, 16, 757, km, 10, 412, mi, the, longest, is, on, the, direttissima, the, great, apennine, tunnel, which, at, 18, 5, kilometres, 11, 5, miles, is, the, longest, entirely, within, italy, although, the, simplon, tunnel, which, connects, italy, and, switzerland, is, longer, automobile, traffic, is, carried, by, the, autostrada, del, sole, route, a1, which, goes, through, numerous, shorter, tunnels, bypassing, an, old, road, originally, roman, through, futa, pass, in, december, 2015, a, new, route, a1, called, variante, di, valico, was, opened, after, many, years, of, construction, consisting, of, major, tunnels, the, longest, being, the, new, 8, 6, kilometre, 5, 3, mile, tunel, base, and, new, overpasses, shortening, the, traveling, time, between, florence, and, bologna, by, road, the, foreste, casentinesi, monte, falterona, campigna, national, park, is, in, the, southern, part, of, the, tuscan, romagnol, apennines, the, southern, limit, of, the, tuscan, romagnol, apennines, is, the, bocca, serriola, pass, in, northern, umbria, which, links, fano, and, citt, di, castello, the, tiber, river, at, rome, flows, from, monte, fumaiolo, in, the, tuscan, romagnol, apennine, from, northeast, to, southwest, projecting, into, the, tyrrhenian, sea, at, right, angles, to, the, shore, the, upper, tiber, however, flows, from, northwest, to, southeast, gradually, turning, through, one, right, angle, clockwise, the, northern, tiber, valley, is, deep, and, separates, the, apennines, on, the, left, bank, from, a, lesser, range, the, tuscan, anti, apennines, sub, apennines, on, its, right, the, apennine, system, forms, an, irregular, arc, with, centers, of, curvature, located, in, the, tyrrhenian, sea, the, northern, and, southern, segments, comprise, parallel, chains, that, can, be, viewed, as, single, overall, mountain, ridges, such, as, the, ligurian, mountains, the, center, being, thicker, and, more, complex, is, geologically, divided, into, an, inner, and, an, outer, arc, with, regard, to, the, centers, of, curvature, the, geologic, definition, however, is, not, the, same, as, the, geographic, based, on, rock, type, and, orogenic, incidents, the, northern, segment, of, the, arc, is, divided, into, the, outer, northern, apennines, ona, and, the, inner, northern, apennines, ina, the, central, apennines, are, divided, into, the, umbrian, marchean, appennino, umbro, marchigiano, or, roman, apennines, in, the, north, and, the, abruzzi, apennines, appennino, abruzzese, in, the, south, it, extends, from, bocca, serriola, pass, in, the, north, to, forl, pass, in, the, south, the, west, border, of, the, umbria, marche, apennines, or, appennino, umbro, marchigiano, runs, through, cagli, they, extend, south, to, the, tronto, river, the, south, border, of, the, ona, the, highest, peak, monte, vettore, at, 2, 478, m, 8, 130, ft, is, part, of, the, monti, sibillini, incorporated, into, parco, nazionale, dei, monti, sibillini, further, north, is, the, parco, naturale, regionale, della, gola, della, rossa, e, di, frasassi, in, which, are, the, gola, della, rossa, red, gorge, and, frasassi, caves, still, further, north, is, parco, sasso, simone, e, simoncello, the, italian, park, service, calls, it, the, green, heart, of, italy, the, region, is, heavily, forested, such, as, the, riserva, naturale, statale, gola, del, furlo, where, furlo, pass, on, the, via, flaminia, is, located, both, the, etruscans, and, the, romans, constructed, tunnels, here, the, abruzzi, apennines, located, in, abruzzo, molise, and, southeastern, lazio, contain, the, highest, peaks, and, most, rugged, terrain, of, the, apennines, they, are, known, in, history, as, the, territory, of, the, italic, peoples, first, defeated, by, the, city, of, rome, coincidentally, they, exist, in, three, parallel, folds, or, chains, surviving, from, the, orogeny, these, extend, in, a, northwest, southeast, direction, from, the, river, tronto, to, the, river, sangro, which, drain, into, the, adriatic, the, coastal, hills, of, the, east, extend, between, san, benedetto, del, tronto, in, the, north, and, torino, di, sangro, in, the, south, the, eastern, chain, consists, mainly, of, the, southern, part, of, the, monti, sibillini, the, monti, della, laga, the, gran, sasso, d, italia, massif, and, the, majella, massif, among, them, are, two, national, parks, gran, sasso, e, monti, della, laga, national, park, and, majella, national, park, and, the, regional, park, of, the, monti, simbruini, gran, sasso, contains, corno, grande, the, highest, peak, of, the, apennines, 2912, m, other, features, between, the, western, and, central, ranges, are, the, plain, of, rieti, the, valley, of, the, salto, and, the, lago, fucino, while, between, the, central, and, eastern, ranges, are, the, valleys, of, aquila, and, sulmona, the, chief, rivers, on, the, west, are, the, nera, with, its, tributaries, the, velino, and, salto, and, the, aniene, both, of, which, fall, into, the, tiber, on, the, east, there, is, at, first, a, succession, of, small, rivers, which, flow, into, the, adriatic, from, which, the, highest, points, of, the, chain, are, some, 20, km, distant, such, as, the, tronto, tordino, vomano, and, others, the, pescara, which, receives, the, aterno, from, the, north, west, and, the, gizio, from, the, south, east, is, more, important, and, so, is, the, sangro, the, central, apennines, are, crossed, by, the, railway, from, rome, to, pescara, via, avezzano, and, sulmona, the, railway, from, orte, to, terni, and, thence, to, foligno, follows, the, nera, valley, while, from, terni, a, line, ascends, to, the, plain, of, rieti, and, thence, crosses, the, central, chain, to, aquila, whence, it, follows, the, valley, of, the, aterno, to, sulmona, in, ancient, times, the, via, salaria, via, caecilia, and, via, tiburtina, all, ran, from, rome, to, the, adriatic, coast, the, volcanic, mountains, of, the, province, of, rome, are, separated, from, the, apennines, by, the, tiber, valley, and, the, monti, lepini, part, of, the, volscian, chain, by, the, valleys, of, the, sacco, and, liri, in, the, southern, apennines, to, the, south, of, the, sangro, valley, the, three, parallel, chains, are, broken, up, into, smaller, groups, among, them, may, be, named, the, matese, the, highest, point, of, which, is, the, monte, miletto, 2, 050, metres, 6, 725, ft, the, chief, rivers, on, the, south, west, are, the, liri, or, garigliano, with, its, tributary, the, sacco, the, volturno, sebeto, sarno, on, the, north, the, trigno, biferno, and, fortore, daunian, mountains, in, apulia, are, connected, with, the, apennine, range, and, so, are, cilento, hills, on, the, west, on, the, converse, the, promontory, of, mount, gargano, on, the, east, is, completely, isolated, and, so, are, the, campanian, volcanic, arc, near, naples, the, district, is, traversed, from, north, west, to, south, east, by, the, railway, from, sulmona, to, benevento, and, on, to, avellino, and, from, south, west, to, northeast, by, the, railways, from, caianello, via, isernia, to, campobasso, and, termoli, from, caserta, to, benevento, and, foggia, and, from, nocera, inferiore, and, avellino, to, rocchetta, sant, antonio, the, junction, for, foggia, spinazzola, for, barletta, bari, and, taranto, and, potenza, roman, roads, followed, the, same, lines, as, the, railways, the, via, appia, ran, from, capua, to, benevento, whence, the, older, road, went, to, venosa, and, taranto, and, so, to, brindisi, while, the, via, traiana, ran, nearly, to, troia, near, foggia, and, thence, to, bari, the, valley, of, the, ofanto, which, runs, into, the, adriatic, close, to, barletta, marks, the, northern, termination, of, the, first, range, of, the, lucanian, apennines, now, basilicata, which, runs, from, east, to, west, while, south, of, the, valleys, of, the, sele, on, the, west, and, basento, on, the, east, which, form, the, line, followed, by, the, railway, from, battipaglia, via, potenza, to, metaponto, the, second, range, begins, to, run, due, north, and, south, as, far, as, the, plain, of, sibari, the, highest, point, is, the, monte, pollino, 2, 233, metres, 7, 325, ft, the, chief, rivers, are, the, sele, joined, by, the, negro, and, calore, on, the, west, and, the, bradano, basento, agri, sinni, on, the, east, which, flow, into, the, gulf, of, taranto, to, the, south, of, the, last, named, river, there, are, only, unimportant, streams, flowing, into, the, sea, east, and, west, inasmuch, as, here, the, width, of, the, peninsula, diminishes, to, some, 64, kilometres, 40, mi, the, railway, running, south, from, sicignano, to, lagonegro, ascending, the, valley, of, the, negro, is, planned, to, extend, to, cosenza, along, the, line, followed, by, the, ancient, via, popilia, which, beyond, cosenza, reached, the, west, coast, at, terina, and, thence, followed, it, to, reggio, the, via, herculia, a, branch, of, the, via, traiana, ran, from, aequum, tuticum, to, the, ancient, nerulum, at, the, narrowest, point, the, plain, of, sibari, through, which, the, rivers, coscile, and, crati, flow, to, the, sea, occurs, on, the, east, coast, extending, halfway, across, the, peninsula, here, the, limestone, apennines, proper, cease, and, the, granite, mountains, of, calabria, begin, the, first, group, extends, as, far, as, the, isthmus, formed, by, the, gulfs, of, south, eufemia, and, squillace, it, is, known, as, the, sila, and, the, highest, point, reached, is, 1, 930, metres, 6, 330, ft, the, botte, donato, the, forests, which, covered, it, in, ancient, times, supplied, the, greeks, and, sicilians, with, timber, for, shipbuilding, the, railway, from, south, eufemia, to, catanzaro, and, catanzaro, marina, crosses, the, isthmus, and, an, ancient, road, may, have, run, from, squillace, to, monteleone, the, second, group, extends, to, the, south, end, of, the, italian, peninsula, culminating, in, the, aspromonte, 1, 960, metres, 6, 420, ft, to, the, east, of, reggio, di, calabria, in, both, groups, the, rivers, are, quite, unimportant, finally, the, calabrian, southern, apennine, mountains, extend, along, the, northern, coast, of, sicily, the, sicilian, apennines, italian, appennino, siculo, pizzo, carbonara, 6, 493, feet, 1, 979, m, being, the, highest, peak, the, number, of, vascular, plant, species, in, the, apennines, has, been, estimated, at, 5, 599, of, these, 728, 23, 6, are, in, the, treeline, ecotone, hemicryptophytes, predominate, in, the, entire, apennine, chain, the, tree, line, ecotone, is, mainly, grasslands, of, the, montane, grasslands, and, shrublands, biome, with, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, and, mediterranean, forests, woodlands, and, scrub, below, it, the, tree, line, in, the, apennines, can, be, found, in, the, range, 1, 600, m, 5, 200, ft, to, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, about, 5, of, the, map, area, covered, by, the, apennines, is, at, or, above, the, tree, line, or, in, the, treeline, ecotone, the, snow, line, is, at, about, 3, 200, m, 10, 500, ft, leaving, the, apennines, below, it, except, for, the, one, remaining, glacier, snow, may, fall, from, october, to, may, rainfall, increases, with, latitude, the, range, s, climates, depending, on, elevation, and, latitude, are, the, oceanic, climate, and, mediterranean, climate, the, mammal, fauna, is, mainly, composed, of, italian, wolves, endemic, corsican, hare, badgers, weasels, foxes, marmots, etruscan, shrew, crested, porcupine, european, snow, vole, and, apennine, shrews, endemic, marsican, brown, bears, endemic, the, european, fallow, deer, the, european, mouflon, and, the, pyrenean, chamois, there, are, also, numerous, birds, such, as, the, golden, eagle, the, bonelli, s, eagle, the, eurasian, goshawk, the, hoopoe, the, hawk, the, european, roller, the, white, backed, woodpecker, the, european, green, woodpecker, the, alpine, chough, the, egyptian, vulture, the, european, nightjar, the, italian, sparrow, endemic, and, the, eurasian, eagle, owl, there, are, also, numerous, amphibians, such, as, the, apennine, yellow, bellied, toad, endemic, the, italian, cave, salamander, endemic, the, italian, newt, endemic, the, italian, stream, frog, endemic, and, the, spectacled, salamander, endemic, the,

reasons, for, this, choice, are, related, to, the, fact, that, the, italian, wolf, which, inhabits, the, apennine, mountains, and, the, western, alps, features, prominently, in, latin, and, italian, cultures, such, as, in, the, legend, of, the, founding, of, rome, in, italy, the, transhumance, took, place, mainly, starting, from, the, abruzzi, apennines, moving, both, towards, the, tuscan, and, lazio, maremma, and, above, all, towards, the, tavoliere, delle, puglie, the, apennines, are, to, some, extent, covered, with, forests, though, these, were, probably, more, extensive, in, classical, times, pliny, mentions, especially, pine, oak, and, beech, woods, hist, nat, xvi, 177, they, have, indeed, been, greatly, reduced, in, comparatively, modern, times, by, indiscriminate, timber, felling, and, though, serious, attempts, at, reforestation, have, been, made, by, the, government, much, remains, to, be, done, they, also, furnish, considerable, summer, pastures, especially, in,

created, in, the, apennine, orogeny, beginning, in, the, early, neogene, about, 20, mya, the, middle, miocene, and, continuing, today, geographically, they, are, partially, or, appear, to, be, continuous, with, the, alpine, system, prior, to, the, explosion, of, data, on, the, topic, from, about, the, year, 2000, many, authors, took, the, approach, that, the, apennines, had, the, same, origin, as, the, alps, even, today, some, authors, use, the, term, alpine, apennine, system, they, are, not, however, the, same, system, and, did, not, have, the, same, origin, the, alps, were, millions, of, years, old, before, the, apennines, rose, from, the, sea, the, northward, movement, of, the, african, plate, and, its, collision, with, the, european, plate, then, caused, the, alpine, orogeny, beginning, in, the, late, mesozoic, the, band, of, mountains, created, extends, from, spain, to, turkey, in, a, roughly, east, west, direction, and, includes, the, alps, the, apennines, are, much, younger, extend, from, northwest, to, southeast, and, are, not, a, displacement, of, the, alpine, chain, the, key, evidence, of, the, difference, is, the, geologic, behavior, of, the, po, valley, in, northern, italy, compressional, forces, have, been, acting, from, north, to, south, in, the, alps, and, from, south, to, north, in, the, apennines, but, instead, of, being, squeezed, into, mountains, the, valley, has, been, subsiding, at, 1, to, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, per, year, since, about, 25, mya, before, the, apennines, existed, it, is, now, known, to, be, not, an, erosional, feature, but, is, a, filled, portion, of, the, adriatic, trench, called, the, adriatic, foredeep, after, its, function, as, a, subduction, zone, was, discovered, the, apennine, orogeny, is, a, type, of, mountain, building, in, which, two, simpler, types, are, combined, in, an, apparently, paradoxical, configuration, sometimes, this, is, referred, to, as, syn, orogenic, extension, but, the, term, implies, that, the, two, processes, occur, simultaneously, during, time, some, scientists, imagine, that, this, is, relatively, rare, but, not, unique, in, mountain, building, whereas, others, imagine, that, this, is, fairly, common, in, all, mountain, belts, the, retreat, project, have, this, specific, feature, as, one, of, their, focus, points, in, essence, the, east, side, of, italy, features, a, fold, and, thrust, belt, raised, by, compressional, forces, acting, under, the, adriatic, sea, this, side, has, been, called, the, apennine, adriatic, compressional, zone, or, the, apennines, convergence, zone, on, the, west, side, of, italy, fault, block, mountains, prevail, created, by, a, spreading, or, extension, of, the, crust, under, the, tyrrhenian, sea, this, side, is, called, the, tyrrhenian, extensional, zone, the, mountains, of, italy, are, of, paradoxical, provenience, having, to, derive, from, both, compression, and, extension, the, paradox, of, how, contraction, and, extension, can, occur, simultaneously, in, convergent, mountain, belts, remains, a, fundamental, and, largely, unresolved, problem, in, continental, dynamics, both, the, folded, and, the, fault, block, systems, include, parallel, mountain, chains, in, the, folded, system, anticlines, erode, into, the, highest, and, longest, massifs, of, the, apennines, according, to, the, older, theories, originating, from, the, 1930s, to, 1970s, of, dutch, geologists, including, van, bemmelen, compression, and, extension, can, and, should, occur, simultaneously, at, different, depths, in, a, mountain, belt, in, these, theories, these, different, levels, are, called, stockwerke, more, recent, work, in, geotectonics, and, geodynamics, of, the, same, school, of, geoscientists, utrecht, and, amsterdam, university, by, vlaar, wortel, and, cloetingh, and, their, disciples, extended, these, concepts, even, further, into, a, temporal, realm, they, demonstrated, that, internal, and, external, forces, acting, upon, the, mountain, belt, e, g, slab, pull, and, intra, plate, stress, field, modulations, due, to, large, scale, reorganisations, of, the, tectonic, plates, result, in, both, longer,
