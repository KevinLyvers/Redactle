sunda, islands, and, the, world, s, 11th, largest, island, it, is, situated, east, of, borneo, west, of, the, maluku, islands, and, south, of, mindanao, and, the, sulu, archipelago, within, indonesia, only, sumatra, borneo, and, papua, are, larger, in, territory, and, only, java, and, sumatra, are, more, populous, the, landmass, of, sulawesi, includes, four, peninsulas, the, northern, minahasa, peninsula, the, east, peninsula, the, south, peninsula, and, the, southeast, peninsula, three, gulfs, separate, these, peninsulas, the, gulf, of, tomini, between, the, northern, minahasa, and, east, peninsulas, the, tolo, gulf, between, the, east, and, southeast, peninsulas, and, the, bone, gulf, between, the, south, and, southeast, peninsulas, the, strait, of, makassar, runs, along, the, western, side, of, the, island, and, separates, the, island, from, borneo, the, name, sulawesi, possibly, comes, from, the, words, sula, island, and, besi, iron, and, may, refer, to, the, historical, export, of, iron, from, the, rich, lake, matano, iron, deposits, the, name, came, into, common, use, in, english, following, indonesian, independence, the, name, celebes, was, originally, given, to, the, island, by, portuguese, explorers, while, its, direct, translation, is, unclear, it, might, be, considered, a, portuguese, rendering, of, the, native, name, sulawesi, sulawesi, is, the, world, s, eleventh, largest, island, covering, an, area, of, 186, 216, 16, km, 2, 71, 898, sq, mi, including, minor, islands, administered, as, part, of, sulawesi, the, central, part, of, the, island, is, ruggedly, mountainous, such, that, the, island, s, peninsulas, have, traditionally, been, remote, from, each, other, with, better, connections, by, sea, than, by, road, the, three, bays, that, divide, sulawesi, s, peninsulas, are, from, north, to, south, the, tomini, the, tolo, and, the, boni, these, separate, the, minahasa, or, northern, peninsula, the, east, peninsula, the, southeast, peninsula, and, the, south, peninsula, the, strait, of, makassar, runs, along, the, western, side, of, the, island, the, island, is, surrounded, by, borneo, to, the, west, by, the, philippines, to, the, north, by, maluku, to, the, east, and, by, flores, and, timor, to, the, south, the, selayar, islands, make, up, a, peninsula, stretching, southwards, from, southwest, sulawesi, into, the, flores, sea, are, administratively, part, of, sulawesi, the, sangihe, islands, and, talaud, islands, stretch, northward, from, the, northeastern, tip, of, sulawesi, while, buton, and, muna, islands, and, their, neighbors, lie, off, its, southeast, peninsula, the, togian, islands, are, in, the, gulf, of, tomini, and, peleng, island, and, the, banggai, islands, form, a, cluster, between, sulawesi, and, maluku, all, the, above, mentioned, islands, and, many, smaller, ones, off, the, coasts, of, sulawesiare, administratively, part, of, sulawesi, s, six, provinces, the, island, slopes, up, from, the, shores, of, the, deep, seas, surrounding, the, island, to, a, high, mostly, non, volcanic, mountainous, interior, active, volcanoes, are, found, in, the, northern, minahasa, peninsula, stretching, north, to, the, sangihe, islands, the, northern, peninsula, contains, several, active, volcanoes, such, as, mount, lokon, mount, awu, soputan, and, karangetang, according, to, plate, reconstructions, the, island, is, believed, to, have, been, formed, by, the, collision, of, terranes, from, the, asian, plate, forming, the, west, and, southwest, and, from, the, australian, plate, forming, the, southeast, and, banggai, with, island, arcs, previously, in, the, pacific, forming, the, north, and, east, peninsulas, because, of, its, several, tectonic, origins, various, faults, scar, the, land, and, as, a, result, the, island, is, prone, to, earthquakes, including, the, deadly, 2018, and, 2021, quakes, off, the, eastern, coast, of, sulawesi, the, north, banda, sea, was, created, through, subduction, rollback, during, the, early, miocene, evidence, for, this, tectonic, event, lies, with, the, extensive, interconnected, fault, network, found, in, the, area, a, volcanic, seamount, with, its, surrounding, ridges, and, an, accretionary, wedge, off, the, coast, of, east, selawesti, and, banggai, is, an, accumulation, of, carbonate, rocks, from, the, late, miocene, these, carbonates, are, likely, pinnacle, reefs, and, the, carbonate, platform, has, a, total, thickness, of, around, 180, 770, meters, sulawesi, in, contrast, to, most, of, the, other, islands, in, the, biogeographical, region, of, wallacea, is, not, truly, oceanic, but, a, composite, island, at, the, centre, of, the, asia, australia, collision, zone, parts, of, the, island, were, formerly, attached, to, either, the, asian, or, australian, continental, margin, and, became, separated, from, these, areas, by, vicariant, processes, in, the, west, the, opening, of, the, makassar, strait, separated, west, sulawesi, from, sundaland, in, the, eocene, c, 45, mya, in, the, east, the, traditional, view, of, collisions, of, multiple, micro, continental, fragments, sliced, from, new, guinea, with, an, active, volcanic, margin, in, west, sulawesi, at, different, times, since, the, early, miocene, c, 20, mya, has, recently, been, replaced, by, the, hypothesis, that, extensional, fragmentation, has, followed, a, single, miocene, collision, of, west, sulawesi, with, the, sula, spur, the, western, end, of, an, ancient, folded, belt, of, variscan, origin, in, the, late, paleozoic, the, bone, basin, lies, between, the, eastern, and, western, arms, of, sulawesi, according, to, recent, studies, the, basin, has, been, opened, up, due, to, extensional, forces, the, basin, is, bounded, by, normal, faults, on, each, side, of, the, basin, each, side, of, the, basin, is, surrounded, by, uplifted, basement, rock, with, young, sediments, found, in, the, middle, the, past, geological, history, has, allowed, for, a, large, accumulation, of, carbonates, which, could, lead, to, a, higher, potential, of, oil, and, gas, occurrences, however, the, faults, present, in, the, basin, makes, it, a, very, complicated, system, the, oldest, evidence, for, humans, on, sulawesi, are, stone, tools, produced, by, archaic, humans, dating, from, over, 200, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, that, were, found, at, the, talepu, site, in, southwestern, sulawesi, before, october, 2014, the, settlement, of, south, sulawesi, by, modern, humans, had, been, dated, to, c, 30, 000, bc, on, the, basis, of, radiocarbon, dates, obtained, from, rock, shelters, in, maros, no, earlier, evidence, of, human, occupation, had, at, that, point, been, found, but, the, island, almost, certainly, formed, part, of, the, land, bridge, used, for, the, settlement, of, australia, and, new, guinea, by, at, least, 40, 000, bc, there, is, no, evidence, of, homo, erectus, having, reached, sulawesi, crude, stone, tools, first, discovered, in, 1947, on, the, right, bank, of, the, walanae, river, at, barru, now, part, of, bone, regency, which, were, thought, to, date, to, the, pleistocene, on, the, basis, of, their, association, with, vertebrate, fossils, are, now, thought, to, date, to, perhaps, 50, 000, bc, following, peter, bellwood, s, model, of, a, southward, migration, of, austronesian, speaking, farmers, an, radiocarbon, dates, from, caves, in, maros, suggest, a, date, in, the, mid, second, millennium, bc, for, the, arrival, of, a, group, from, east, borneo, speaking, a, proto, south, sulawesi, language, pss, initial, settlement, was, probably, around, the, mouth, of, the, sa, dan, river, on, the, northwest, coast, of, the, peninsula, although, the, south, coast, has, also, been, suggested, subsequent, migrations, across, the, mountainous, landscape, resulted, in, the, geographical, isolation, of, pss, speakers, and, the, evolution, of, their, languages, into, the, eight, families, of, the, south, sulawesi, language, group, if, each, group, can, be, said, to, have, a, homeland, that, of, the, bugis, today, the, most, numerous, group, was, around, lakes, t, mp, and, sid, nr, ng, in, the, walenna, depression, here, for, some, 2, 000, years, lived, the, linguistic, group, that, would, become, the, modern, bugis, the, archaic, name, of, this, group, which, is, preserved, in, other, local, languages, was, ugiq, despite, the, fact, that, today, they, are, closely, linked, with, the, makassarese, the, closest, linguistic, neighbors, of, the, bugis, are, the, torajans, pre, 1200, bugis, society, was, most, likely, organized, into, chiefdoms, some, anthropologists, have, speculated, these, chiefdoms, would, have, warred, and, in, times, of, peace, interbred, further, they, have, speculated, that, personal, security, would, have, been, negligible, and, head, hunting, an, established, cultural, practice, the, political, economy, would, have, been, a, mixture, of, hunting, and, gathering, and, swidden, or, shifting, agriculture, speculative, planting, of, wet, rice, may, have, taken, place, along, the, margins, of, the, lakes, and, rivers, in, central, sulawesi, there, are, more, than, 400, granite, megaliths, which, various, archaeological, studies, have, dated, to, be, from, 3000, bc, to, ad, 1300, they, vary, in, size, from, a, few, centimeters, to, approximately, 4, 5, meters, 15, ft, the, original, purpose, of, the, megaliths, is, unknown, approximately, 30, of, the, megaliths, represent, human, forms, other, megaliths, are, in, form, of, large, pots, kalamba, and, stone, plates, tutu, na, a, burial, of, a, woman, associated, with, the, hunter, gatherer, toalean, culture, dating, to, 7, 000, years, ago, has, yielded, dna, that, has, provided, rare, insight, into, early, migrations, in, and, through, the, region, in, october, 2014, it, was, announced, that, cave, paintings, in, maros, had, been, dated, as, being, approximately, 40, 000, years, old, one, of, a, hand, was, 39, 900, years, old, which, brings, it, among, the, oldest, known, hand, stencils, in, the, world, the, record, is, detained, so, far, by, a, 64, 000, years, old, stencil, hand, made, by, a, neanderthal, in, maltravieso, cave, c, ceres, spain, dr, maxime, aubert, of, griffith, university, in, queensland, australia, said, that, was, the, minimum, age, for, the, outline, in, pettakere, cave, in, maros, and, added, next, to, it, is, a, pig, that, has, a, minimum, age, of, 35, 400, years, old, and, this, is, one, of, the, oldest, figurative, depictions, in, the, world, if, not, the, oldest, one, on, 11, december, 2019, a, team, of, researchers, led, by, dr, maxime, aubert, announced, the, discovery, of, the, oldest, hunting, scenes, in, prehistoric, art, in, the, world, that, is, more, than, 44, 000, years, old, from, the, limestone, cave, of, leang, bulu, sipong, 4, archaeologists, determined, the, age, of, the, depiction, of, hunting, a, pig, and, buffalo, thanks, to, the, calcite, popcorn, different, isotope, levels, of, radioactive, uranium, and, thorium, in, march, 2020, two, small, stone, plaquettes, were, found, by, griffith, university, archaeologists, in, the, leang, bulu, bettue, cave, dated, to, a, time, between, 26, 000, and, 14, 000, years, ago, while, one, of, the, stones, contained, an, anoa, water, buffalo, and, what, may, be, a, flower, star, or, eye, another, depicted, astronomic, rays, of, light, in, january, 2021, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, cave, art, that, is, at, least, 45, 500, years, old, in, a, leang, tedongnge, cave, according, to, the, journal, science, advances, the, cave, painting, of, a, warty, pig, is, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, settlement, of, the, region, an, adult, male, pig, measuring, 136, cm, x, 54, cm, and, what, is, likely, a, sulawesi, or, celebes, warty, pig, sus, celebensis, was, depicted, with, horn, like, facial, warts, and, two, hand, prints, above, its, hindquarters, according, to, co, author, adam, brumm, there, are, two, other, pigs, that, are, partly, preserved, and, it, appears, the, warty, pig, was, observing, a, fight, between, the, two, other, pigs, a, bronze, amaravathi, statue, was, discovered, at, sikendeng, south, sulawesi, near, karama, river, in, 1921, which, was, dated, to, 2nd, 7th, century, ad, by, bosch, 1933, in, 1975, small, locally, made, buddhist, statues, from, 10th, 11th, century, were, also, discovered, in, bontoharu, on, the, island, of, selayar, south, sulawesi, starting, in, the, 13th, century, access, to, prestige, trade, goods, and, to, sources, of, iron, started, to, alter, long, standing, cultural, patterns, and, to, permit, ambitious, individuals, to, build, larger, political, units, it, is, not, known, why, these, two, ingredients, appeared, together, one, was, perhaps, the, product, of, the, other, in, 1367, several, identified, polities, located, on, the, island, were, mentioned, in, the, javanese, manuscript, nagarakretagama, dated, from, the, majapahit, period, canto, 14, mentioned, polities, including, gowa, makassar, luwu, and, banggai, it, seems, that, by, the, 14th, century, polities, in, the, island, were, connected, in, an, archipelagic, maritime, trading, network, centered, in, the, majapahit, port, in, east, java, by, 1400, a, number, of, nascent, agricultural, principalities, had, arisen, in, the, western, cenrana, valley, as, well, as, on, the, south, coast, and, on, the, west, coast, near, modern, parepare, the, first, europeans, to, visit, the, island, which, they, believed, to, be, an, archipelago, due, to, its, contorted, shape, were, the, portuguese, sailors, sim, o, de, abreu, in, 1523, and, gomes, de, sequeira, among, others, in, 1525, sent, from, the, moluccas, in, search, of, gold, which, the, islands, had, the, reputation, of, producing, a, portuguese, base, was, installed, in, makassar, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 16th, century, lasting, until, 1665, when, it, was, taken, by, the, dutch, the, dutch, had, arrived, in, sulawesi, in, 1605, and, were, quickly, followed, by, the, english, who, established, a, factory, in, makassar, from, 1660, the, dutch, were, at, war, with, gowa, the, major, makassar, west, coast, power, in, 1669, admiral, speelman, forced, the, ruler, sultan, hasanuddin, to, sign, the, treaty, of, bongaya, which, handed, control, of, trade, to, the, dutch, east, india, company, the, dutch, were, aided, in, their, conquest, by, the, bugis, warlord, arung, palakka, ruler, of, the, bugis, kingdom, of, bone, the, dutch, built, a, fort, at, ujung, pandang, while, arung, palakka, became, the, regional, overlord, and, bone, the, dominant, kingdom, political, and, cultural, development, seems, to, have, slowed, as, a, result, of, the, status, quo, in, 1905, the, entire, island, became, part, of, the, dutch, state, colony, of, the, netherlands, east, indies, until, japanese, occupation, in, the, second, world, war, during, the, indonesian, national, revolution, the, dutch, captain, turk, westerling, led, campaigns, in, which, hundreds, maybe, thousands, died, during, the, south, sulawesi, campaign, following, the, transfer, of, sovereignty, in, december, 1949, sulawesi, became, part, of, the, federal, united, states, of, indonesia, which, in, 1950, became, absorbed, into, the, unitary, republic, of, indonesia, the, portuguese, were, rumoured, to, have, a, fort, in, parigi, in, 1555, the, kaili, were, an, important, group, based, in, the, palu, valley, and, related, to, the, toraja, scholars, relate, that, their, control, swayed, under, ternate, and, makassar, but, this, might, have, been, a, decision, by, the, dutch, to, give, their, vassals, a, chance, to, govern, a, difficult, group, padbruge, commented, that, in, the, 1700s, the, kaili, population, was, significantly, high, and, were, a, highly, militant, society, in, the, 1850s, a, civil, war, erupted, between, the, kaili, groups, including, the, banawa, in, which, the, dutch, colonial, government, decided, to, intervene, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, sarasins, journeyed, through, the, palu, valley, as, part, of, a, major, initiative, to, bring, the, kaili, under, dutch, rule, some, very, surprising, and, interesting, photographs, were, taken, of, shamans, called, tadulako, further, christian, religious, missions, entered, the, area, to, make, one, of, the, most, detailed, ethnographic, studies, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, swede, by, the, name, of, walter, kaudern, later, studied, much, of, the, literature, and, produced, a, synthesis, erskine, downs, in, the, 1950s, produced, a, summary, of, kruyts, and, andrianis, work, the, religion, of, the, bare, e, speaking, toradja, of, central, celebes, which, is, invaluable, for, english, speaking, researchers, one, of, the, most, recent, publications, is, when, the, bones, are, left, a, study, of, the, material, culture, of, central, sulawesi, offering, extensive, analysis, also, worthy, of, study, are, the, brilliant, works, of, monnig, atkinson, on, the, wana, shamans, who, live, in, the, mori, area, population, of, sulawesi, by, province, 2020, census, at, the, 2000, census, the, population, of, the, provinces, of, sulawesi, was, 14, 946, 488, about, 7, 25, of, indonesia, s, total, population, by, the, 2010, census, the, total, had, reached, 17, 371, 782, and, the, 2020, census, recorded, a, total, of, 19, 896, 951, the, official, estimate, for, mid, 2023, was, 20, 568, 411, the, largest, city, on, sulawesi, is, makassar, religion, in, sulawesi, 2023, islam, is, the, majority, religion, in, sulawesi, the, conversion, of, the, lowlands, of, the, south, western, peninsula, south, sulawesi, to, islam, occurred, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, kingdom, of, luwu, in, the, gulf, of, bone, was, the, first, to, embrace, islam, in, february, 1605, the, makassar, kingdom, of, gowa, talloq, centred, on, the, modern, day, city, of, makassar, followed, suit, in, september, however, the, gorontalo, and, the, mongondow, peoples, of, the, northern, peninsula, largely, converted, to, islam, only, in, the, 19th, century, most, muslims, are, sunnis, christians, form, a, substantial, minority, on, the, island, according, to, the, demographer, toby, alice, volkman, 17, of, sulawesi, s, population, is, protestant, and, less, than, 2, is, catholic, christians, are, concentrated, on, the, tip, of, the, northern, peninsula, around, the, city, of, manado, which, is, inhabited, by, the, minahasa, a, predominantly, protestant, people, and, the, northernmost, sangir, and, talaud, islands, the, toraja, people, of, tana, toraja, in, south, sulawesi, have, largely, converted, to, christianity, since, indonesia, s, independence, there, are, also, substantial, numbers, of, christians, around, lake, poso, in, central, sulawesi, among, the, pamona, speaking, peoples, of, central, sulawesi, and, near, mamasa, though, most, people, identify, themselves, as, muslims, or, christians, they, often, subscribe, to, local, beliefs, and, deities, as, well, smaller, communities, of, buddhists, and, hindus, are, also, found, on, sulawesi, usually, among, the, chinese, balinese, and, indian, communities, the, economy, of, sulawesi, is, heavily, centered, around, agriculture, fishing, mining, and, forestry, the, island, was, administered, as, one, province, between, 1945, and, 1960, in, 1960, it, was, divided, into, two, provinces, north, and, central, sulawesi, and, south, and, southeast, sulawesi, in, 1964, both, of, these, were, again, divided, the, former, into, north, sulawesi, and, central, sulawesi, and, the, latter, into, south, sulawesi, and, southeast, sulawesi, today, it, is, subdivided, into, six, provinces, gorontalo, west, sulawesi, south, sulawesi, central, sulawesi, southeast, sulawesi, and, north, sulawesi, among, these, the, newest, provinces, are, gorontalo, established, in, 2000, from, part, of, north, sulawesi, and, west, sulawesi, established, in, 2004, from, part, of, south, sulawesi, the, largest, cities, on, the, island, are, the, provincial, capitals, of, makassar, manado, palu, kendari, and, gorontalo, the, provincial, capital, of, west, sulawesi, the, town, of, mamuju, is, not, a, city, there, are, six, other, cities, bitung, palopo, bau, bau, parepare, kotamobagu, and, tomohun, sulawesi, is, part, of, wallacea, meaning, that, it, has, a, mix, of, both, indomalayan, and, australasian, species, that, reached, the, island, by, crossing, deep, water, oceanic, barriers, the, flora, includes, one, native, eucalypt, e, deglupta, there, are, 8, national, parks, on, the, island, of, which, 4, are, mostly, marine, the, parks, with, the, largest, terrestrial, area, are, bogani, nani, wartabone, with, 2, 871, km, 2, and, lore, lindu, national, park, with, 2, 290, km, 2, bunaken, national, park, which, protects, a, rich, coral, ecosystem, has, been, proposed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, coast, of, northern, tip, of, sulawesi, is, identified, as, a, site, of, highest, marine, biodiversity, importance, in, the, coral, triangle, early, in, the, pleistocene, sulawesi, had, a, dwarf, elephant, and, a, dwarf, form, of, stegodon, an, elephant, relative, s, sompoensis, later, both, were, replaced, by, larger, forms, a, giant, suid, celebochoerus, was, also, formerly, present, it, is, thought, that, many, of, the, migrants, to, sulawesi, arrived, via, the, philippines, while, sulawesi, in, turn, served, as, a, way, station, for, migrants, to, flores, a, pleistocene, faunal, turnover, is, recognized, with, the, competitive, displacement, of, several, indigenous, tarsiers, by, more, recently, arriving, ones, and, of, celebochoerus, by, other, medium, sized, herbivores, like, the, babirusa, anoa, and, celebes, warty, pig, there, are, 127, known, extant, native, mammalian, species, in, sulawesi, a, large, percentage, 62, 79, species, are, endemic, meaning, that, they, are, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, the, largest, of, these, are, the, two, species, of, anoa, or, dwarf, buffalo, other, artiodactyl, species, inhabiting, sulawesi, are, the, warty, pig, and, the, babirusas, which, are, aberrant, pigs, the, only, native, carnivoran, is, the,
