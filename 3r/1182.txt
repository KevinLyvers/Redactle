important, changes, in, its, urban, space, and, public, transport, looking, to, plan, demographic, and, economic, growth, that, would, position, it, as, a, strategic, hub, for, international,

development, of, the, city, for, the, next, two, centuries, one, of, the, most, important, interventions, in, the, city, was, in, its, transportation, system, in, 1967, there, were, 2, 679, urban, buses, in, bogot, that, transported, on, average, 1, 630, 000, passengers, per, day, the, city, had, about, 1, million, inhabitants, and, 80, km, 2, of, area, the, service, was, relatively, reasonable, but, as, the, city, grew, and, reached, more, than, five, million, and, an, area, greater, than, 300, km, 2, not, only, did, the, car, fleet, increase, substantially, to, more, than, 20, 000, vehicles, but, traffic, complexity, increased, as, well, as, pollution, and, the, inefficiency, of, the, only, existing, transportation, system, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, situation, was, difficult, there, was, no, real, urban, public, transport, system, that, would, serve, as, an, alternative, to, the, private, vehicle, which, further, incentivized, its, use, and, the, city, had, low, levels, of, competitiveness, in, latin, america, as, well, as, an, unsatisfactory, quality, of, life, for, the, vast, majority, of, its, inhabitants, the, administrations, of, mayors, andr, s, pastrana, 1988, 90, and, jaime, castro, 1992, 94, in, addition, to, the, first, of, antanas, mockus, 1995, 97, formulated, proposals, to, solve, the, problem, of, public, transport, with, limited, results, it, was, during, the, mayoralty, of, the, latter, when, there, was, talk, about, the, possibility, of, establishing, a, mass, transportation, system, that, would, help, remedy, the, problem, of, mobility, under, the, second, administration, of, antanas, mockus, bogot, opened, a, zone, of, tolerancia, which, legalized, prostitution, in, a, large, swath, of, the, center, of, the,

in, the, execution, of, the, development, plan, for, the, bogot, we, want, in, terms, of, mobility, and, in, a, mass, transportation, system, project, the, construction, of, special, infrastructure, exclusively, for, its, operation, was, determined, this, system, would, include, specialized, bus, corridors, equipped, with, single, use, lanes, stations, bridges, bike, paths, and, special, pedestrian, access, platforms, designed, to, facilitate, the, user, s, experience, in, the, system, however, pe, alosa, became, infamous, for, his, campaign, against, the, poor, saying, he, would, rather, see, robbers, on, the, streets, than, people, selling, candies, pe, alosa, served, a, second, term, 2016, 19, after, getting, elected, in, 2011, gustavo, petro, clashed, with, the, conservative, political, establishment, after, remunicipalization, of, the, city, s, garbage, collection, system, the, inspector, general, alejandro, ordo, ez, deposed, petro, for, alleged, constitutional, overreach, when, he, tried, to, replace, the, city, s, private, trash, collectors, petro, was, reinstated, weeks, later, after, a, bogot, court, ruled, that, ordo, ez, had, overstepped, his, authority, although, the, proposal, for, biarticulated, diesel, buses, called, transmilenio, was, in, its, early, stages, a, success, due, in, part, to, the, small, numbers, of, passengers, it, transported, in, the, long, term, it, became, an, inefficient, and, contaminating, system, saturated, for, a, metro, population, of, almost, ten, million, guilty, of, environmental, deterioration, and, air, pollution, for, its, part, the, cultural, equipment, plan, of, bogot, has, yielded, significant, results, including, the, construction, of, three, large, public, libraries, in, different, sectors, these, libraries, have, not, only, expanded, access, to, existing, library, resources, but, also, serve, as, some, of, the, 150, hubs, for, biblored, bogot, s, public,

1810, barely, changed, its, urban, layout, and, culture, santafe, was, slowly, leaving, behind, the, colonialism, after, the, independence, revolution, from, 1810, to, 1819, entering, the, 19th, century, the, city, of, bogot, was, still, the, political, and, demographic, core, of, nueva, granada, but, remained, a, small, city, as, compared, with, similar, cities, such, as, lima, and, buenos, aires, at, the, year, of, 1801, the, city, had, 173, blocks, and, 21, 394, inhabitants, marking, a, slow, population, growth, during, the, 18th, century, in, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, city, life, was, marked, by, the, lack, of, cultural, activity, and, public, services, as, well, as, by, the, excessive, catholic, religiosity, in, its, inhabitants, which, almost, controlled, the, whole, life, of, people, as, a, journalist, traveler, wrote, in, 1822, biblioteca, luis, angel, arango, 1990, 2, the, city, s, urban, shape, remained, the, same, in, the, 19th, century, as, the, 1557, urban, landscape, as, a, checkerboard, with, the, plaza, as, its, core, in, other, words, the, city, grew, in, area, adding, new, square, blocks, but, kept, the, same, urban, fabric, buildings, were, low, rise, as, a, traveler, wrote, in, 1830, bibliotheca, luis, angel, arango, 1990, 2, where, most, city, buildings, had, one, floor, and, a, few, had, no, more, than, two, one, special, characteristic, of, those, houses, with, two, floors, which, were, the, houses, of, the, wealthiest, families, of, bogot, were, their, balconies, the, building, facades, of, bogot, were, very, simplistic, without, ornaments, meaning, no, more, than, a, wall, with, windows, and, the, entry, door, however, due, to, the, poor, street, conditions, because, of, the, potholes, and, waste, in, addition, to, the, lack, of, cultural, and, social, activity, at, night, the, ornaments, were, reserved, to, indoors, where, bogotanos, spent, most, of, their, time, one, of, the, few, outdoor, activities, of, the, people, of, bogot, during, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, was, going, to, the, plaza, or, the, altozano, as, the, locals, called, it, the, plaza, was, the, social, core, of, the, city, where, fresh, fruits, were, sold, and, where, inhabitants, from, all, socioeconomic, backgrounds, converged, bibliotheca, luis, angel, arango, 1990, 2, the, landscape, of, bogot, was, very, similar, from, the, 16th, century, to, 19th, century, nonetheless, after, the, milestone, fact, of, the, independence, from, the, spanish, which, was, a, process, that, lasted, at, least, ten, years, from, 1810, to, 1819, some, changes, started, to, happen, those, changes, were, happening, slowly, while, the, new, republican, order, was, getting, power, trying, to, make, a, difference, from, the, colonial, ages, the, new, republic, began, changing, the, name, of, the, plazas, streets, and, even, the, name, of, the, city, from, santafe, to, bogot, the, names, of, colonial, streets, were, changed, to, numbers, and, the, name, of, plazas, were, changed, to, the, founding, fathers, of, colombia, thereafter, the, empty, plazas, of, the, colonial, ages, turned, into, ornamented, plazas, with, plenty, of, trees, and, civic, statues, for, instance, the, first, civil, statue, placed, in, a, plaza, in, colombia, was, the, figure, of, bolivar, the, main, founding, father, of, colombia, the, statue, of, bolivar, was, unveiled, on, july, 20, 1846, which, is, the, independence, day, of, colombia, trying, to, strengthen, the, patriotism, of, the, new, republic, in, people, of, bogot, and, colombia, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, from, 1870, to, 1900, more, clearly, marked, a, new, urban, landscape, of, bogot, the, constant, rural, migration, to, bogot, had, been, one, of, the, most, important, factors, that, allowed, the, city, to, maintain, its, influential, power, in, the, region, both, during, the, colonial, ages, and, during, the, republic, in, 1847, the, city, governor, and, the, council, tried, to, expand, the, urban, area, of, bogot, beyond, the, colonial, limits, whereas, only, until, the, 1860s, was, that, expansion, encouraged, by, the, president, of, colombia, tomas, cipriano, de, mosquera, the, mosquera, plan, included, lotting, the, western, part, of, bogot, building, bridges, and, wider, roads, and, plazas, but, that, plan, was, only, partially, implemented, in, the, following, decade, other, urban, initiatives, emerged, but, this, time, from, the, private, sector, a, group, of, businessmen, tired, of, the, city, s, slow, growth, and, development, proposed, the, construction, of, sewars, theaters, electric, systems, and, new, roads, in, order, to, hasten, the, development, of, bogot, because, of, the, 1876, civil, war, the, plan, could, not, be, implemented, but, from, that, initiative, the, council, adopted, the, first, urban, code, of, bogot, in, 1875, these, initiatives, tried, to, update, the, undeveloped, city, to, the, new, technologies, of, the, 1800s, however, the, pace, remained, slow, and, only, after, 1882, when, the, train, and, the, trolley, came, to, bogot, some, urban, development, projects, progressed, more, quickly, today, bogot, has, 20, localities, or, districts, forming, an, extensive, network, of, neighborhoods, areas, of, higher, economic, status, tend, to, be, located, in, the, north, close, to, the, eastern, hills, in, the, districts, of, chapinero, usaqu, n, and, the, east, of, suba, the, lower, middle, class, inhabit, the, central, western, and, northwestern, parts, of, the, city, the, working, class, neighborhoods, are, located, in, the, south, some, of, them, squatter, areas, the, urban, layout, in, the, center, of, the, city, is, based, on, the, focal, point, of, a, square, or, plaza, typical, of, spanish, founded, settlements, but, the, layout, gradually, becomes, more, modern, in, outlying, neighborhoods, the, types, of, roads, are, classified, as, calles, streets, which, run, from, west, to, east, horizontally, with, street, numbers, increasing, towards, the, north, and, also, towards, the, south, with, the, suffix, sur, from, calle, 0, down, south, carreras, roads, run, from, north, to, south, vertically, with, numbering, increasing, from, east, to, west, with, the, suffix, este, for, roads, east, of, carrera, 0, at, the, southeast, of, the, city, the, addresses, are, logically, sur, este, other, types, of, roads, more, common, in, newer, parts, of, the, city, may, be, termed, eje, axis, diagonal, or, transversal, the, numbering, system, for, street, addresses, recently, changed, and, numbers, are, assigned, according, to, street, rank, from, main, avenues, to, smaller, avenues, and, local, streets, some, of, bogot, s, main, roads, which, also, go, by, a, proper, name, in, addition, to, a, number, are, the, largest, and, most, populous, city, in, colombia, bogot, had, 7, 412, 566, inhabitants, within, the, city, s, limits, 2018, census, with, a, population, density, of, approximately, 4, 310, inhabitants, per, square, kilometer, only, 25, 166, people, are, located, in, rural, areas, of, capital, district, 47, 8, of, the, population, are, male, and, 52, 2, women, in, bogot, as, in, the, rest, of, the, country, urbanization, has, accelerated, due, to, industrialization, as, well, as, complex, political, and, social, reasons, such, as, poverty, and, violence, which, led, to, migration, from, rural, to, urban, areas, throughout, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, a, dramatic, example, of, this, is, the, number, of, displaced, people, who, have, arrived, in, bogot, due, to, the, internal, armed, conflict, some, estimates, show, that, bogot, s, floating, population, may, be, as, high, as, 4, million, people, most, of, them, being, migrant, workers, from, other, departments, and, displaced, people, the, majority, of, the, displaced, population, lives, in, the, ciudad, bol, var, kennedy, usme, and,

98, 8, of, the, population, has, no, ethnic, affiliation, but, are, whites, and, mestizos, in, bogot, the, accelerated, urbanization, process, is, not, exclusively, due, to, industrialization, since, there, are, complex, political, and, social, reasons, such, as, poverty, and, violence, which, have, motivated, migration, from, the, countryside, to, the, city, throughout, the, 20th, century, determining, an, exponential, growth, of, the, population, in, bogot, and, the, establishment, of, misery, belts, in, its, surroundings, according, to, the, consultancy, for, human, rights, codhes, in, the, period, 1999, 2005, more, than, 260, 000, displaced, people, arrived, in, bogot, approximately, 3, 8, of, the, total, population, of, bogot, the, locations, where, the, majority, of, the, displaced, population, is, concentrated, are, ciudad, bolivar, kennedy, bosa, and, usme, bogot, has, gone, to, great, lengths, to, change, its, formerly, notorious, crime, rate, and, its, image, with, increasing, success, after, being, considered, in, the, 1990s, to, be, one, of, the, most, violent, cities, in, the, world, in, 1993, there, were, 4, 352, murders, at, a, rate, of, 81, per, 100, 000,
