fleeing, a, famine, as, a, result, many, of, the, ukrainians, settled, in, chechen, ingush, assr, permanently, and, survived, the, famine, although, over, 50, 000, chechens, and, over, 12, 000, ingush, were, fighting, against, nazi, germany, on, the, front, line, including, heroes, of, the, ussr, abukhadzhi, idrisov, khanpasha, nuradilov, movlid, visaitov, and, although, nazi, german,

separate, chechen, ingush, regiment, movlid, visaitov, the, first, to, contact, american, forces, at, elbe, river, were, deported, there, is, a, theory, that, the, real, reason, why, chechens, and, ingush, were, deported, was, the, desire, of, russia, to, attack, turkey, an, anti, communist, country, as, chechens, and, ingush, could, impede, such, plans, in, 2004, the, european, parliament, recognized, the, deportation, of, chechens, and, ingush, as, an, act, of, genocide, the, territory, of, the, chechen, ingush, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, was, divided, between, stavropol,

soviet, federative, socialist, republic, and, hence, did, not, have, a, right, under, the, soviet, constitution, to, secede, it, also, argued, that, other, republics, of, russia, such, as, tatarstan, would, consider, seceding, from, the, russian, federation, if, chechnya, were, granted, that, right, finally, it, argued, that, chechnya, was, a, major, hub, in, the, oil, infrastructure, of, russia,
