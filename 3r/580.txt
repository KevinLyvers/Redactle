indies, in, the, caribbean, region, next, to, north, america, and, north, of, south, america, and, is, the, most, easterly, of, the, caribbean, islands, it, lies, on, the, boundary, of, the, south, american, and, caribbean, plates, its, capital, and, largest, city, is, bridgetown, inhabited, by, kalinago, people, since, the, 13th, century, and, prior, to, that, by, other, indigenous, peoples, spanish, navigators, took, possession, of, barbados, in, the, late, 15th, century, claiming, it, for, the, crown, of, castile, it, first, appeared, on, a, spanish, map, in, 1511, the, portuguese, empire, claimed, the, island, between, 1532, and, 1536, but, abandoned, it, in, 1620, with, their, only, remnants, being, an, introduction, of, wild, boars, for, a, good, supply, of, meat, whenever, the, island, was, visited, an, english, ship, the, olive, blossom, arrived, in, barbados, on, 14, may, 1625, its, men, took, possession, of, the, island, in, the, name, of, king, james, i, in, 1627, the, first, permanent, settlers, arrived, from, england, and, barbados, became, an, english, and, later, british, colony, during, this, period, the, colony, operated, on, a, plantation, economy, relying, on, the, labour, of, african, slaves, who, worked, on, the, island, s, plantations, slavery, continued, until, it, was, phased, out, through, most, of, the, british, empire, by, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, on, 30, november, 1966, barbados, moved, towards, political, independence, and, assumed, the, status, of, a, commonwealth, realm, becoming, a, separate, jurisdiction, with, elizabeth, ii, as, the, queen, of, barbados, on, 30, november, 2021, barbados, transitioned, to, a, republic, within, the, commonwealth, replacing, its, monarchy, with, a, ceremonial, president, barbados, s, population, is, predominantly, of, african, ancestry, while, it, is, technically, an, atlantic, island, barbados, is, closely, associated, with, the, caribbean, and, is, ranked, as, one, of, its, leading, tourist, destinations, the, name, barbados, is, from, either, the, portuguese, term, os, barbados, or, the, spanish, equivalent, los, barbados, both, meaning, the, bearded, ones, it, is, unclear, whether, bearded, refers, to, the, long, hanging, roots, of, the, bearded, fig, tree, ficus, citrifolia, a, species, of, banyan, indigenous, to, the, island, or, to, the, allegedly, bearded, kalinago, island, caribs, who, once, inhabited, the, island, or, more, fancifully, to, a, visual, impression, of, a, beard, formed, by, the, sea, foam, that, sprays, over, the, outlying, coral, reefs, in, 1519, a, map, produced, by, the, genoese, mapmaker, visconte, maggiolo, showed, and, named, barbados, in, its, correct, position, furthermore, the, island, of, barbuda, in, the, leewards, is, very, similar, in, name, and, was, once, named, las, barbudas, by, the, spanish, the, original, name, for, barbados, in, the, pre, columbian, era, was, ichirouganaim, according, to, accounts, by, descendants, of, the, indigenous, arawakan, speaking, tribes, in, other, regional, areas, with, possible, translations, including, red, land, with, white, teeth, or, redstone, island, with, teeth, outside, reefs, or, simply, teeth, colloquially, barbadians, refer, to, their, home, island, as, bim, or, other, nicknames, associated, with, barbados, including, bimshire, the, origin, is, uncertain, but, several, theories, exist, the, national, cultural, foundation, of, barbados, says, that, bim, was, a, word, commonly, used, by, slaves, and, that, it, derives, from, the, igbo, term, b, m, from, b, m, meaning, my, home, kindred, kind, the, igbo, phoneme, in, the, igbo, orthography, is, very, close, to, the, name, could, have, arisen, due, to, the, relatively, large, percentage, of, igbo, slaves, from, modern, day, southeastern, nigeria, arriving, in, barbados, in, the, 18th, century, the, words, bim, and, bimshire, are, recorded, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, and, chambers, twentieth, century, dictionaries, another, possible, source, for, bim, is, reported, to, be, in, the, agricultural, reporter, of, 25, april, 1868, where, the, rev, n, greenidge, father, of, one, of, the, island, s, most, famous, scholars, abel, hendy, jones, greenidge, suggested, that, bimshire, was, introduced, by, an, old, planter, listing, it, as, a, county, of, england, expressly, named, were, wiltshire, hampshire, berkshire, and, bimshire, lastly, in, the, daily, argosy, of, demerara, i, e, guyana, of, 1652, there, is, a, reference, to, bim, as, a, possible, corruption, of, byam, the, name, of, a, royalist, leader, against, the, parliamentarians, that, source, suggested, the, followers, of, byam, became, known, as, bims, and, that, this, became, a, word, for, all, barbadians, around, 700, 000, years, ago, the, island, emerged, from, the, ocean, as, a, body, of, soft, rock, known, as, a, diapir, rose, from, the, mantle, beneath, its, present, day, location, this, process, is, still, ongoing, raising, barbados, at, an, average, rate, of, 30, centimeters, per, thousand, years, dozens, of, inland, sea, reefs, still, dominate, coastal, features, within, terraces, and, cliffs, on, the, island, archeological, evidence, suggests, humans, may, have, first, settled, or, visited, the, island, c, 1600, bc, more, permanent, amerindian, settlement, of, barbados, dates, to, about, the, 4th, to, 7th, centuries, ad, by, a, group, known, as, the, saladoid, barrancoid, settlements, of, arawaks, from, south, america, appeared, by, around, 800, ad, and, again, in, the, 12th, 13th, century, the, kalinago, called, caribs, by, the, spanish, visited, the, island, regularly, although, there, is, no, evidence, of, permanent, settlement, it, is, uncertain, which, european, nation, arrived, first, in, barbados, which, probably, would, have, been, at, some, point, in, the, 15th, century, or, 16th, century, one, lesser, known, source, points, to, earlier, revealed, works, antedating, contemporary, sources, indicating, it, could, have, been, the, spanish, many, if, not, most, believe, the, portuguese, en, route, to, brazil, were, the, first, europeans, to, come, upon, the, island, the, island, was, largely, ignored, by, europeans, though, spanish, slave, raiding, is, thought, to, have, reduced, the, native, population, with, many, fleeing, to, other, islands, the, first, english, ship, which, had, arrived, on, 14, may, 1625, was, captained, by, john, powell, the, first, settlement, began, on, 17, february, 1627, near, what, is, now, holetown, formerly, jamestown, after, king, james, i, of, england, by, a, group, led, by, john, powell, s, younger, brother, henry, consisting, of, 80, settlers, and, 10, english, indentured, labourers, some, sources, state, that, some, africans, were, amongst, these, first, settlers, the, settlement, was, established, as, a, proprietary, colony, and, funded, by, sir, william, courten, a, city, of, london, merchant, who, acquired, the, title, to, barbados, and, several, other, islands, the, first, colonists, were, actually, tenants, and, much, of, the, profits, of, their, labour, returned, to, courten, and, his, company, courten, s, title, was, later, transferred, to, james, hay, 1st, earl, of, carlisle, in, what, was, called, the, great, barbados, robbery, carlisle, then, chose, as, governor, henry, powell, who, established, the, house, of, assembly, in, 1639, in, an, effort, to, appease, the, planters, who, might, otherwise, have, opposed, his, controversial, appointment, in, the, period, 1640, 1660, the, west, indies, attracted, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, total, number, of, english, emigrants, to, the, americas, by, 1650, there, were, 44, 000, settlers, in, the, west, indies, as, compared, to, 12, 000, on, the, chesapeake, and, 23, 000, in, new, england, most, english, arrivals, were, indentured, after, five, years, of, labour, they, were, given, freedom, dues, of, about, 10, usually, in, goods, before, the, mid, 1630s, they, also, received, 5, to, 10, acres, 2, to, 4, hectares, of, land, but, after, that, time, the, island, filled, and, there, was, no, more, free, land, during, the, cromwellian, era, 1650s, this, included, a, large, number, of, prisoners, of, war, vagrants, and, people, who, were, illicitly, kidnapped, who, were, forcibly, transported, to, the, island, and, sold, as, servants, these, last, two, groups, were, predominantly, irish, as, several, thousand, were, infamously, rounded, up, by, english, merchants, and, sold, into, servitude, in, barbados, and, other, caribbean, islands, during, this, period, a, practice, that, came, to, be, known, as, being, barbadosed, cultivation, of, sugar, was, thus, handled, primarily, by, european, indentured, labour, until, it, became, difficult, to, bring, more, indentured, servants, from, england, parish, registers, from, the, 1650s, show, that, for, the, white, population, there, were, four, times, as, many, deaths, as, marriages, the, mainstay, of, the, infant, colony, s, economy, was, the, growth, export, of, tobacco, but, tobacco, prices, eventually, fell, in, the, 1630s, as, chesapeake, production, expanded, around, the, same, time, fighting, during, the, war, of, the, three, kingdoms, and, the, interregnum, spilled, over, into, barbados, and, barbadian, territorial, waters, the, island, was, not, involved, in, the, war, until, after, the, execution, of, charles, i, when, the, island, s, government, fell, under, the, control, of, royalists, ironically, the, governor, philip, bell, remaining, loyal, to, parliament, while, the, barbadian, house, of, assembly, under, the, influence, of, humphrey, walrond, supported, charles, ii, to, try, to, bring, the, recalcitrant, colony, to, heel, the, commonwealth, parliament, passed, an, act, on, 3, october, 1650, prohibiting, trade, between, england, and, barbados, and, because, the, island, also, traded, with, the, netherlands, further, navigation, acts, were, passed, prohibiting, any, but, english, vessels, trading, with, dutch, colonies, these, acts, were, a, precursor, to, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, the, commonwealth, of, england, sent, an, invasion, force, under, the, command, of, sir, george, ayscue, which, arrived, in, october, 1651, ayscue, with, a, smaller, force, that, included, scottish, prisoners, surprised, a, larger, force, of, royalists, but, had, to, resort, to, spying, and, diplomacy, ultimately, on, 11, january, 1652, the, royalists, in, the, house, of, assembly, led, by, lord, willoughby, surrendered, which, marked, the, end, of, royalist, privateering, as, a, major, threat, the, conditions, of, the, surrender, were, incorporated, into, the, charter, of, barbados, treaty, of, oistins, which, was, signed, at, the, mermaid, s, inn, oistins, on, 17, january, 1652, starting, with, cromwell, a, large, percentage, of, the, white, labourer, population, were, indentured, servants, and, involuntarily, transported, people, from, ireland, irish, servants, in, barbados, were, often, treated, poorly, and, barbadian, planters, gained, a, reputation, for, cruelty, 55, the, decreased, appeal, of, an, indenture, on, barbados, combined, with, enormous, demand, for, labour, caused, by, sugar, cultivation, led, to, the, use, of, involuntary, transportation, to, barbados, as, a, punishment, for, crimes, or, for, political, prisoners, and, also, to, the, kidnapping, of, labourers, who, were, deported, to, barbados, 55, irish, indentured, servants, were, a, significant, portion, of, the, population, throughout, the, period, when, white, servants, were, used, for, plantation, labour, in, barbados, and, while, a, steady, stream, of, irish, servants, entered, the, barbados, throughout, the, 17th, century, cromwellian, efforts, to, pacify, ireland, created, a, veritable, tidal, wave, of, irish, labourers, who, were, sent, to, barbados, during, the, 1650s, 56, due, to, inadequate, historical, records, the, total, number, of, irish, labourers, sent, to, barbados, is, unknown, and, estimates, have, been, highly, contentious, 56, while, one, historical, source, estimated, that, as, many, as, 50, 000, irish, people, were, deported, to, either, barbados, or, virginia, during, the, 1650s, this, estimate, is, quite, likely, exaggerated, 56, another, estimate, that, 12, 000, irish, prisoners, had, arrived, in, barbados, by, 1655, has, been, described, as, probably, exaggerated, by, historian, richard, b, sheridan, 236, according, to, historian, thomas, bartlett, it, is, generally, accepted, that, approximately, 10, 000, irish, were, deported, to, the, west, indies, and, approximately, 40, 000, came, as, voluntary, indentured, servants, while, many, also, travelled, as, voluntary, un, indentured, emigrants, 256, the, introduction, of, sugar, cane, from, dutch, brazil, in, 1640, completely, transformed, society, the, economy, and, the, physical, landscape, barbados, eventually, had, one, of, the, world, s, biggest, sugar, industries, one, group, instrumental, in, ensuring, the, early, success, of, the, industry, was, the, sephardic, jews, who, had, originally, been, expelled, from, the, iberian, peninsula, to, end, up, in, dutch, brazil, as, the, effects, of, the, new, crop, increased, so, did, the, shift, in, the, ethnic, composition, of, barbados, and, surrounding, islands, the, workable, sugar, plantation, required, a, large, investment, and, a, great, deal, of, heavy, labour, at, first, dutch, traders, supplied, the, equipment, financing, and, african, slaves, in, addition, to, transporting, most, of, the, sugar, to, europe, in, 1644, the, population, of, barbados, was, estimated, at, 30, 000, of, which, about, 800, were, of, african, ancestry, with, the, remainder, mainly, of, english, ancestry, these, english, smallholders, were, eventually, bought, out, and, the, island, filled, up, with, large, sugar, plantations, worked, by, african, slaves, by, 1660, there, was, near, parity, with, 27, 000, black, people, and, 26, 000, white, people, by, 1666, at, least, 12, 000, white, smallholders, had, been, bought, out, died, or, left, the, island, many, choosing, to, emigrate, to, jamaica, or, the, american, colonies, notably, the, carolinas, as, a, result, barbados, enacted, a, slave, code, as, a, way, of, legislatively, controlling, its, enslaved, black, population, the, law, s, text, was, influential, in, laws, in, other, colonies, by, 1680, there, were, 20, 000, free, whites, and, 46, 000, enslaved, africans, by, 1724, there, were, 18, 000, free, whites, and, 55, 000, enslaved, africans, the, harsh, conditions, endured, by, the, slaves, resulted, in, several, planned, slave, rebellions, the, largest, of, which, was, bussa, s, rebellion, in, 1816, which, was, rapidly, suppressed, by, the, colonial, authorities, in, 1819, another, slave, revolt, broke, out, on, easter, day, the, revolt, was, put, down, in, blood, with, heads, being, displayed, on, stakes, nevertheless, the, brutality, of, the, repression, shocked, even, england, and, strengthened, the, abolitionist, movement, growing, opposition, to, slavery, led, to, its, abolition, in, the, british, empire, in, 1833, the, plantocracy, class, retained, control, of, political, and, economic, power, on, the, island, with, most, workers, living, in, relative, poverty, the, 1780, hurricane, killed, more, than, 4, 000, people, on, barbados, in, 1854, a, cholera, epidemic, killed, more, than, 20, 000, inhabitants, deep, dissatisfaction, with, the, situation, on, barbados, led, many, to, emigrate, things, came, to, a, head, in, the, 1930s, during, the, great, depression, as, barbadians, began, demanding, better, conditions, for, workers, the, legalisation, of, trade, unions, and, a, widening, of, the, franchise, which, at, that, point, was, limited, to, male, property, owners, as, a, result, of, the, increasing, unrest, the, british, sent, a, commission, called, the, west, indies, royal, commission, or, moyne, commission, in, 1938, which, recommended, enacting, many, of, the, requested, reforms, on, the, islands, as, a, result, afro, barbadians, began, to, play, a, much, more, prominent, role, in, the, colony, s, politics, with, universal, suffrage, being, introduced, in, 1950, prominent, among, these, early, activists, was, grantley, herbert, adams, who, helped, found, the, barbados, labour, party, blp, in, 1938, he, became, the, first, premier, of, barbados, in, 1953, followed, by, fellow, blp, founder, hugh, gordon, cummins, from, 1958, to, 1961, a, group, of, left, leaning, politicians, who, advocated, swifter, moves, to, independence, broke, off, from, the, blp, and, founded, the, democratic, labour, party, dlp, in, 1955, the, dlp, subsequently, won, the, 1961, barbadian, general, election, and, their, leader, errol, barrow, became, premier, full, internal, self, government, was, enacted, in, 1961, barbados, joined, the, short, lived, british, west, indies, federation, from, 1958, to, 1962, later, gaining, full, independence, on, 30, november, 1966, errol, barrow, became, the, country, s, first, prime, minister, barbados, opted, to, remain, within, the, commonwealth, of, nations, the, effect, of, political, independence, meant, that, the, united, kingdom, government, ceased, to, having, sovereignty, over, barbados, elizabeth, ii, instead, reigning, in, the, country, became, the, queen, of, barbados, the, monarch, then, was, represented, locally, by, a, governor, general, the, barrow, government, sought, to, diversify, the, economy, away, from, agriculture, seeking, to, boost, industry, and, the, tourism, sector, barbados, was, also, at, the, forefront, of, regional, integration, efforts, spearheading, the, creation, of, carifta, and, caricom, the, dlp, lost, the, 1976, barbadian, general, election, to, the, blp, under, tom, adams, adams, adopted, a, more, conservative, and, strongly, pro, western, stance, allowing, the, americans, to, use, barbados, as, the, launchpad, for, their, invasion, of, grenada, in, 1983, adams, died, in, office, in, 1985, and, was, replaced, by, harold, bernard, st, john, however, st, john, lost, the, 1986, barbadian, general, election, which, saw, the, return, of, the, dlp, under, errol, barrow, who, had, been, highly, critical, of, the, us, intervention, in, grenada, barrow, too, died, in, office, and, was, replaced, by, lloyd, erskine, sandiford, who, remained, prime, minister, until, 1994, owen, arthur, of, the, blp, won, the, 1994, barbadian, general, election, remaining, prime, minister, until, 2008, arthur, was, a, strong, advocate, of, republicanism, though, a, planned, referendum, to, replace, queen, elizabeth, as, head, of, state, in, 2008, never, took, place, the, dlp, won, the, 2008, barbadian, general, election, but, the, new, prime, minister, david, thompson, died, in, 2010, and, was, replaced, by, freundel, stuart, the, blp, returned, to, power, in, 2018, under, mia, mottley, who, became, barbados, s, first, female, prime, minister, the, government, of, barbados, announced, on, 15, september, 2020, that, it, intended, to, become, a, republic, by, 30, november, 2021, the, 55th, anniversary, of, its, independence, resulting, in, the, replacement, of, the, barbadian, monarchy, with, a, president, elected, through, electoral, college, barbados, would, then, cease, to, be, a, commonwealth, realm, but, could, maintain, membership, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, like, guyana, and, trinidad, and, tobago, on, 20, september, 2021, just, over, a, full, year, after, the, announcement, for, the,

from, the, south, american, plate, and, deposits, it, above, the, subduction, zone, forming, an, accretionary, prism, the, rate, of, this, depositing, of, material, allows, barbados, to, rise, at, a,
