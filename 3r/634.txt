following, the, russian, revolution, the, area, of, modern, south, ossetia, became, part, of, the, democratic, republic, of, georgia, in, 1918, conflict, began, between, the, landless, ossetian, peasants, living, in, shida, kartli, interior, georgia, who, were, influenced, by, bolshevism, and, demanded, ownership, of, the, lands, they, worked, and, the, menshevik, government, backed, ethnic, georgian, aristocrats, who, were, legal, owners, although, the, ossetians, were, initially, discontented, with, the, economic, policies, of, the, central, government, the, tension, soon, transformed, into, ethnic, conflict, the, first, ossetian, rebellion, began, in, february, 1918, when, three, georgian, princes, were, killed, and, their, land, was, seized, by, the, ossetians, the, central,

proceeded, to, occupy, the, town, of, tskhinvali, and, began, attacking, the, ethnic, georgian, civilian, population, during, uprisings, in, 1919, and, 1920, the, ossetians, were, covertly, supported, by, soviet, russia, but, even, so, were, defeated, according, to, allegations, made, by, ossetian, sources, the, crushing, of, the, 1920, uprising, caused, the, death, of, 5, 000, ossetians, while, ensuing, hunger, and, epidemics, were, the, causes, of, death, of, more, than, 13, 000, people, the, soviet, georgian, government, established, after, the, red, army, invasion, of, georgia, in, 1921, created, an, autonomous, administrative, unit, for, transcaucasian, ossetians, in, april, 1922, under, pressure, from, kavbiuro, the, caucasian, bureau, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, called, the, south, ossetian, autonomous, oblast, ao, some, believe, that, the, bolsheviks, granted, this, autonomy, to, the, ossetians, in, exchange, for, their, bolshevik, loyalty, in, fighting, the, democratic, republic, of, georgia, and, favouring, local, separatists, since, this, area, had, never, been, a, separate, entity, prior, to, the, russian, invasion, the, drawing, of, administrative, boundaries, of, the, south, ossetian, ao, was, quite, a, complicated, process, many, georgian, villages, were, included, within, the, south, ossetian, ao, despite, numerous, protests, by, the, georgian, population, while, the, city, of, tskhinvali, did, not, have, a, majority, ossetian, population, it, was, made, the, capital, of, the, south, ossetian, ao, in, addition, to, parts, of, gori, uezd, and, dusheti, uezd, of, tiflis, governorate, parts, of, racha, uezd, of, kutaisi, governorate, western, georgia, were, also, included, within, the, south,

thirds, of, ossetians, in, the, georgian, soviet, socialist, republic, lived, outside, the, south, ossetian, ao, tensions, in, the, region, began, to, rise, amid, rising, nationalism, among, both, georgians, and, ossetians, in, 1989, before, this, the, two, communities, of, the, south, ossetian, autonomous, oblast, of, the, georgian, ssr, had, been, living, in, peace, with, each, other, except, for, the, 1918, 1920, events, both, ethnicities, had, a, normal, degree, of, interaction, and, there, were, many, georgian, ossetian, intermarriages, the, dispute, surrounding, the, presence, of, the, ossetian, people, in, the, south, caucasus, has, been, one, of, the, causes, of, conflict, although, georgian, historiography, believes, that, ossetian, mass, migration, to, the, south, caucasus, georgia, began, in, the, 17th, century, ossetians, claim, to, have, been, residing, in, the, area, since, the, ancient, times, which, is, not, supported, by, available, sources, some, ossetian, historians, accept, that, the, migration, of, ossetian, ancestors, to, modern, south, ossetia, began, after, the, mongol, invasions, of, the, 13th, century, while, one, south, ossetian, de, facto, foreign, minister, in, the, 1990s, said, that, the, ossetians, first, appeared, in, the, area, only, in, the, early, 17th, century, since, it, was, created, after, the, russian, invasion, of, 1921,
