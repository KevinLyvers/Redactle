erne, are, an, archipelago, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, and, an, autonomous, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, the, official, language, of, the, country, is, faroese, which, is, closely, related, to, and, partially, mutually, intelligible, with, icelandic, located, a, similar, distance, from, iceland, norway, and, the, united, kingdom, the, islands, have, a, total, area, of, about, 1, 400, square, kilometres, 540, sq, mi, with, a, population, of, 54, 676, as, of, august, 2023, the, terrain, is, rugged, and, the, subpolar, oceanic, climate, cfc, is, windy, wet, cloudy, and, cool, despite, the, northerly, climate, the, temperatures, are, moderated, by, the, gulf, stream, and, average, above, freezing, throughout, the, year, hovering, around, 12, c, 54, f, in, summer, and, 5, c, 41, f, in, winter, as, a, result, of, its, northerly, latitude, and, proximity, to, the, arctic, circle, the, islands, experience, perpetual, civil, twilight, during, summer, nights, and, very, short, winter, days, the, capital, and, largest, city, t, rshavn, receives, the, fewest, recorded, hours, of, sunshine, of, any, city, in, the, world, at, only, 840, per, year, while, archaeological, evidence, places, the, first, known, habitation, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, f, reyinga, saga, and, the, writings, of, dicuil, place, initial, norse, settlement, in, the, early, 9th, century, as, with, the, subsequent, settlement, of, iceland, the, islands, were, mainly, settled, by, norwegians, and, norse, gaels, who, additionally, brought, thralls, i, e, slaves, or, serfs, of, gaelic, origin, following, the, introduction, of, christianity, by, sigmundur, brestisson, the, islands, came, under, norwegian, rule, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, faroe, islands, followed, norway, s, integration, into, the, kalmar, union, in, 1397, and, came, under, de, facto, danish, rule, following, that, union, s, dissolution, in, 1523, following, the, introduction, of, lutheranism, in, 1538, the, usage, of, faroese, was, banned, in, churches, schools, and, state, institutions, and, disappeared, from, writing, for, more, than, three, centuries, the, islands, were, formally, ceded, to, denmark, in, 1814, by, the, treaty, of, kiel, along, with, greenland, and, iceland, and, the, l, gting, was, subsequently, replaced, by, a, danish, judiciary, following, the, re, establishment, of, the, l, gting, and, an, official, faroese, orthography, the, faroese, language, conflict, saw, danish, being, gradually, displaced, by, faroese, as, the, language, of, the, church, public, education, and, law, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, islands, were, occupied, by, the, british, during, the, second, world, war, who, refrained, from, governing, faroese, internal, affairs, inspired, by, this, period, of, relative, self, government, and, the, declaration, of, iceland, as, a, republic, in, 1944, the, islands, held, a, referendum, in, 1946, that, resulted, in, a, narrow, majority, for, independence, the, results, were, annulled, by, christian, x, and, subsequent, negotiations, led, to, the, faroe, islands, being, granted, home, rule, in, 1948, while, remaining, part, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, to, this, day, the, faroe, islands, have, extensive, autonomy, and, control, most, areas, apart, from, military, defence, policing, justice, and, currency, with, partial, control, over, its, foreign, affairs, because, the, faroe, islands, are, not, part, of, the, same, customs, area, as, denmark, they, have, an, independent, trade, policy, and, are, able, to, establish, their, own, trade, agreements, with, other, states, the, islands, have, an, extensive, bilateral, free, trade, agreement, with, iceland, known, as, the, hoyv, k, agreement, in, the, nordic, council, they, are, represented, as, part, of, the, danish, delegation, in, certain, sports, the, faroe, islands, field, their, own, national, teams, they, did, not, become, a, part, of, the, european, economic, community, in, 1973, instead, keeping, autonomy, over, their, own, fishing, waters, as, a, result, the, faroe, islands, are, not, a, part, of, the, european, union, today, the, l, gting, albeit, suspended, between, 1816, and, 1852, holds, a, claim, as, one, of, the, oldest, continuously, running, parliaments, in, the, world, the, islands, endonym, f, royar, as, well, as, its, english, name, faroe, islands, alt, faeroe, or, the, faroes, derive, from, the, old, norse, f, reyjar, the, second, element, oyar, islands, is, a, holdover, from, old, faroese, sound, changes, have, rendered, the, word, s, modern, form, as, oyggjar, names, for, individual, islands, such, as, kalsoy, and, su, uroy, also, preserve, the, old, form, the, name, s, ultimate, etymological, origin, has, been, subject, to, dispute, the, most, widely, held, theory, first, attested, in, f, reyinga, saga, interprets, it, as, a, straightforward, compound, of, f, r, sheep, and, eyjar, islands, meaning, sheep, islands, in, reference, to, their, abundance, on, the, archipelago, clergymen, peder, clausson, and, lucas, debes, began, casting, doubt, on, this, theory, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, arguing, that, the, west, norse, speaking, settlers, whose, word, for, sheep, was, sau, r, instead, of, the, east, norse, f, r, could, not, have, coined, it, from, this, exact, origin, debes, surmised, that, it, could, have, derived, from, fj, r, far, while, hammershaimb, leaned, towards, fara, to, go, to, travel, others, have, theorised, an, old, irish, origin, relating, it, to, the, etymologies, of, neighbouring, orkney, and, shetland, scottish, writers, james, currie, and, william, j, watson, suggested, respectively, the, words, feur, pasture, eaten, up, outfield, and, fearann, land, territory, as, possible, derivations, arguing, that, the, original, celtic, attestations, of, the, islands, made, this, more, likely, archaeologist, anton, wilhelm, br, gger, concurred, elaborating, on, watson, s, theory, by, positing, that, the, norse, having, first, learned, of, the, islands, from, scottish, and, irish, accounts, as, a, fearann, could, have, coined, f, reyjar, as, a, phono, semantic, match, archaeological, studies, from, 2021, found, evidence, of, settlement, on, the, islands, before, the, arrival, of, norse, settlers, uncovering, burnt, grains, of, domesticated, barley, and, peat, ash, deposited, in, two, phases, the, first, dated, between, the, mid, fourth, and, mid, sixth, centuries, and, another, between, the, late, sixth, and, late, eighth, centuries, researchers, have, also, found, sheep, dna, in, lake, bed, sediments, dating, to, the, year, 500, barley, and, sheep, had, to, have, been, brought, to, the, islands, by, humans, as, scandinavians, did, not, begin, using, sails, until, about, 750, it, is, unlikely, they, could, have, reached, the, faroes, before, then, leading, to, the, study, concluding, that, the, settlers, were, more, likely, to, originate, from, scotland, or, ireland, these, findings, concur, with, historical, accounts, from, the, same, period, archaeologist, mike, church, noted, that, irish, monk, dicuil, described, a, group, of, islands, north, of, scotland, of, very, similar, character, to, the, faroe, islands, in, his, work, de, mensura, orbis, terrae, of, the, measure, of, the, worlds, of, the, earth, in, this, text, dicuil, describes, a, group, of, small, islands, nearly, all, of, them, separated, by, narrow, stretches, of, water, that, were, always, deserted, since, the, beginning, of, time, and, previously, populated, by, heremitae, ex, nostra, scotia, hermits, from, our, land, of, ireland, scotland, for, almost, a, hundred, years, before, being, displaced, by, the, arrival, of, norse, pirates, church, argued, that, these, were, likely, the, eremitic, papar, that, had, similarly, resided, in, parts, of, iceland, and, scotland, in, the, same, period, writers, like, br, gger, and, peter, andreas, munch, had, drawn, the, same, connections, from, dicuil, s, writings, with, the, latter, arguing, that, these, papar, were, also, the, ones, to, bring, sheep, to, the, islands, a, ninth, century, voyage, tale, concerning, irish, saint, brendan, one, of, dicuil, s, contemporaries, details, him, visiting, an, unnamed, northern, group, of, islands, this, has, also, been, argued, to, be, referring, to, the, faroe, islands, though, not, nearly, as, conclusively, a, number, of, toponyms, around, the, islands, refer, to, the, papar, and, the, irish, such, as, papar, kur, near, vestmanna, and, papursh, lsur, near, saksun, vestmanna, is, itself, short, for, vestmannah, vn, harbour, of, the, westmen, tombstones, in, a, churchyard, on, sk, voy, display, a, possible, gaelic, origin, or, influence, old, norse, speaking, settlers, arrived, in, the, early, 9th, century, and, their, old, west, norse, dialect, would, later, evolve, into, the, modern, faroese, language, a, number, of, the, settlers, were, norse, gaels, who, did, not, come, directly, from, scandinavia, but, rather, from, norse, communities, that, spanned, the, irish, sea, northern, isles, and, outer, hebrides, of, scotland, including, the, shetland, and, orkney, islands, these, settlers, also, brought, thralls, of, gaelic, origin, with, them, and, this, admixture, is, reflected, today, in, the, faroese, genetic, makeup, and, a, number, of, loanwords, from, old, irish, a, traditional, name, for, the, islands, in, irish, na, scigir, possibly, derives, from, eyja, skeggjar, island, beards, a, nickname, given, to, island, dwellers, according, to, f, reyinga, saga, many, of, the, norwegian, settlers, in, particular, were, spurred, by, their, disapproval, of, the, monarchy, of, harald, fairhair, whose, rule, was, also, seen, as, an, inciting, factor, for, the, settlement, of, iceland, the, founding, date, of, the, l, gting, is, not, historically, documented, though, the, saga, implies, that, it, was, a, well, established, institution, by, the, middle, of, the, 10th, century, when, a, legal, dispute, between, chieftains, havgr, mur, and, einar, su, uroyingur, resulting, in, the, exile, of, eldj, rn, kambh, ttur, is, recounted, in, detail, christianity, was, introduced, to, the, islands, in, the, late, 10th, and, early, 11th, centuries, by, chieftain, sigmundur, brestisson, baptised, as, an, adult, by, then, king, of, norway, olaf, tryggvason, his, mission, to, introduce, christianity, was, part, of, a, greater, plan, to, seize, the, islands, on, behalf, of, the, norwegian, crown, while, christianity, arrived, at, the, same, time, as, in, iceland, the, process, was, met, with, much, more, conflict, and, violence, and, was, defined, particularly, by, sigmundur, s, conflict, with, rival, chieftain, tr, ndur, g, tu, the, latter, of, whom, was, converted, under, threat, of, decapitation, although, their, conflict, resulted, in, sigmundur, s, murder, the, islands, fell, firmly, under, norwegian, rule, following, tr, ndur, s, death, in, 1035, while, the, faroe, islands, formally, remained, a, norwegian, possession, until, 1814, norway, s, merger, into, the, kalmar, union, in, 1397, gradually, resulted, in, the, islands, coming, under, de, facto, danish, control, when, the, protestant, reformation, reached, the, faroe, islands, in, 1538, the, faroese, language, was, also, outlawed, in, schools, churches, and, official, documentation, thus, faroese, remained, exclusively, a, spoken, language, until, the, 19th, century, following, the, napoleonic, wars, the, union, between, denmark, and, norway, was, dissolved, by, the, treaty, of, kiel, in, 1814, while, norway, was, transferred, to, the, swedish, crown, denmark, retained, possession, of, norway, s, north, atlantic, territories, which, included, the, faroe, islands, along, with, greenland, and, iceland, shortly, afterwards, denmark, asserted, control, and, began, to, restrict, the, islands, autonomy, in, 1816, the, faroe, islands, was, reconstituted, as, a, county, amt, within, the, danish, kingdom, the, l, gting, having, operated, continuously, for, almost, a, millennium, was, dissolved, and, replaced, by, a, danish, judiciary, and, the, post, of, l, gma, ur, lawspeaker, was, likewise, replaced, by, a, danish, appointed, amtmand, equivalent, to, a, governor, general, as, part, of, its, mercantilist, economic, policy, denmark, maintained, a, monopoly, over, trade, with, the, faroe, islands, and, forbade, the, faroese, from, trading, with, other, countries, the, trade, monopoly, in, the, faroe, islands, was, eventually, abolished, in, 1856, after, which, the, area, developed, into, a, modern, fishing, based, economy, with, its, own, fishing, fleet, in, 1846, the, faroe, islands, finally, regained, formal, political, representation, when, they, were, allocated, two, seats, in, the, danish, rigsdag, the, l, gting, itself, was, reinstated, as, an, advisory, body, to, the, amtmand, in, 1852, an, official, faroese, orthography, was, first, introduced, in, 1846, by, lutheran, minister, venceslaus, ulricus, hammershaimb, returning, the, language, to, print, after, 300, years, of, only, existing, in, oral, form, with, the, return, of, written, faroese, to, the, public, sphere, after, more, than, 300, years, nationalism, gained, a, foothold, in, faroese, society, the, modern, faroese, national, movement, is, commonly, agreed, to, have, begun, with, the, christmas, meeting, of, 1888, held, to, discuss, how, to, defend, the, faroese, language, and, faroese, traditions, this, meeting, led, to, the, rise, of, two, of, the, movement, s, most, prominent, early, figures, j, annes, patursson, and, rasmus, effers, e, it, was, initially, exclusively, concerned, with, the, status, of, the, faroese, language, but, it, soon, gained, a, political, dimension, with, the, advent, of, the, faroese, language, conflict, in, the, early, 20th, century, both, sides, of, the, conflict, were, represented, by, the, country, s, first, ever, political, parties, the, union, party, sambandsflokkurin, founded, in, 1906, which, supported, faroese, literature, but, opposed, its, usage, in, education, and, the, self, government, party, sj, lvst, risflokkurin, which, sought, to, introduce, faroese, as, the, official, language, in, all, public, spheres, and, additionally, demanded, increased, political, autonomy, for, the, islands, the, faroese, language, gradually, won, out, laws, and, protocols, of, the, l, gting, were, written, in, faroese, from, 1927, onwards, schools, switched, to, faroese, as, the, language, of, instruction, in, 1938, and, faroese, was, fully, authorised, as, the, language, of, the, church, the, following, year, finally, in, 1944, faroese, gained, equal, status, with, danish, in, legal, proceedings, in, the, first, year, of, the, second, world, war, on, 12, april, 1940, british, troops, occupied, the, faroe, islands, in, operation, valentine, nazi, germany, had, invaded, denmark, and, commenced, the, invasion, of, norway, on, 9, april, 1940, under, operation, weser, bung, in, 1942, 1943, the, british, royal, engineers, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, colonel, william, law, built, the, first, and, only, airport, in, the, faroe, islands, v, gar, airport, the, british, refrained, from, governing, faroese, internal, affairs, and, the, islands, became, effectively, self, governing, during, the, war, after, the, war, ended, and, the, british, army, left, this, period, and, iceland, s, declaration, as, a, republic, in, 1944, served, as, a, precedent, and, a, model, in, the, mind, of, many, faroe, islanders, the, l, gting, held, an, independence, referendum, on, 14, september, 1946, resulting, in, a, very, narrow, majority, for, independence, 50, 73, voted, in, favour, and, 49, 27, against, the, margin, was, only, 161, votes, the, l, gting, subsequently, declared, independence, on, 18, september, 1946, this, declaration, was, annulled, by, denmark, on, 20, september, arguing, that, the, number, of, invalid, votes, 481, being, greater, than, the, narrow, margin, in, favour, made, the, result, invalid, as, a, result, king, christian, x, of, denmark, ordered, that, the, faroese, l, gting, be, dissolved, on, 24, september, with, new, elections, held, that, november, the, faroese, parliamentary, election, of, 1946, resulted, in, a, majority, for, parties, opposed, to, independence, following, protracted, negotiations, denmark, granted, home, rule, to, the, faroe, islands, on, 30, march, 1948, this, agreement, granted, the, islands, a, high, degree, of, autonomy, and, faroese, finally, became, the, official, language, in, all, public, spheres, in, 1973, the, faroe, islands, declined, to, join, denmark, in, entering, the, european, economic, community, eec, as, a, result, the, islands, are, not, part, of, the, european, union, eu, today, although, as, danish, citizens, faroe, islanders, are, still, considered, eu, citizens, following, the, collapse, of, the, fishing, industry, in, the, early, 1990s, the, faroes, experienced, considerable, economic, difficulties, the, faroe, islands, are, an, island, group, consisting, of, 18, major, islands, and, a, total, of, 779, islands, islets, and, skerries, about, 655, kilometres, 407, mi, off, the, coast, of, northern, europe, between, the, norwegian, sea, and, the, north, atlantic, ocean, about, halfway, between, iceland, and, norway, the, closest, neighbours, being, the,

climate, is, classed, as, subpolar, oceanic, climate, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, cfc, with, areas, having, a, tundra, climate, especially, in, the, mountains, although, some, coastal, or, low, lying, areas, may, have, very, mild, winter, versions, of, a, tundra, climate, the, overall, character, of, the, climate, of, the, islands, is, influenced, by, the, strong, warming, influence, of, the, atlantic, ocean, which, produces, the, north, atlantic, current, this, together, with, the, remoteness, of, any, source, of, landmass, induced, warm, or, cold, airflows,

dominated, by, seabirds, and, birds, attracted, to, open, land, such, as, heather, probably, because, of, the, lack, of, woodland, and, other, suitable, habitats, many, species, have, developed, special, faroese, sub, species, such, as, the, common, eider, common, starling, eurasian, wren, and, black, guillemot, the, pied, raven, a, colour, morph, of, the, north, atlantic, subspecies, of,

by, the, islanders, in, accordance, with, longstanding, local, tradition, orcas, orcinus, orca, are, regular, visitors, around, the, islands, the, domestic, animals, of, the, faroe, islands, are, a, result, of, 1, 200, years, of, isolated, breeding, as, a, result, many, of, the, islands, domestic, animals, are, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, faroese, domestic, breeds, include, faroe, pony, faroe, cow, faroe, sheep, faroese, goose, and, faroese, duck, the, islands, were, built, up, during, a, period, of, high, volcanic, activity, in, the, early, palaeogene, around, 50, 60, million, years, ago, the, islands, are, built, up, in, layers, of, different, lava, flows, basalt, alternating, with, thin, layers, of, volcanic, ash, tuff, the, soft, ash, and, the, hard, basalt, thus, lie, layer, upon, layer, in, narrow, and, thick, strips, the, soft, tuff, or, ash, zones, erode, away, relatively, quickly, and, the, hard, lump, of, basalt, above, the, eroded, tuff, falls, away, forming, the, first, terrace, volcanic, activity, has, varied, over, millions, of, years, with, periods, of, quiescence, and, various, periods, of, quiet, eruptive, fissures, and, explosive, volcanism, in, a, few, places, mainly, on, su, uroy, thin, layers, of, coal, are, present, which, are, the, remains, of, swamp, forests, from, the, time, between, volcanic, eruptions, the, plateau, has, therefore, been, divided, into, different, basalt, series, according, to, the, course, of, volcanism, and, the, age, sequence, of, the, layers, there, are, major, differences, in, the, shapes, of, the, islands, terraces, the, lowest, and, oldest, series, are, thick, lava, deposits, that, can, be, seen, on, the, southern, part, of, su, uroy, mykines, and, tindh, lmur, and, the, western, side, of, v, gar, the, basalts, of, the, lower, basalt, series, are, often, pillared, which, is, shown, by, elongated, angular, and, regular, pillars, in, the, mountain, side, very, regular, vertical, columns, are, found, on, northern, mykines, where, they, can, be, up, to, 30, metres, 100, ft, high, the, middle, basalt, series, consists, of, thin, lava, flows, with, a, highly, porous, interlayer, this, series, has, very, little, resistance, to, crumbling, and, weathering, as, these, erosion, processes, are, more, severe, at, higher, altitudes, than, lower, down, the, lowlands, are, filled, with, weathering, material, from, the, heights, often, resulting, in, a, characteristic, curved, landscape, shape, this, can, be, clearly, seen, on, v, gar, the, northernmost, part, of, streymoy, and, the, north, western, part, of, eysturoy, glacial, activity, has, reduced, plateau, surfaces, especially, on, the, northern, islands, where, the, surfaces, have, been, reduced, to, a, series, of, narrower, or, wider, zig, zag, rows, along, the, length, of, the, islands, especially, on, the, islands, of, kunoy, kalsoy, and, bor, oy, where, an, eastward, and, a, westward, ice, mass, have, eroded, the, intervening, mountain, range, into, a, narrow, ridge, the, faroe, islands, are, a, self, governing, country, under, the, external, sovereignty, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, the, faroese, government,

union, and, norway, came, under, the, rule, of, the, king, of, sweden, while, the, faroe, islands, iceland, and, greenland, remained, danish, possessions, from, ancient, times, the, faroe, islands, had, a, parliament, l, gting, which, was, abolished, in, 1816, and, the, faroe, islands, were, to, be, governed, as, an, ordinary, danish, amt, county, with, the, amtmand, as, its, head, of, government, in, 1851, the, l, gting, was, reinstated, but, until, 1948, served, mainly, as, an, advisory, body, the, islands, are, home, to, a, notable, independence, movement, that, has, seen, an, increase, in, popular, support, within, recent, decades, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, some, of, the, population, favoured, independence, from, denmark, and, on, 14, september, 1946, an, independence, referendum, was, held, on, the, question, of, secession, it, was, a, consultative, referendum, the, parliament, not, being, bound, to, follow, the, people, s, vote, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, faroese, people, had, been, asked, whether, they, favoured, independence, or, wanted, to, continue, within, the, danish, kingdom, the, result, of, the, vote, was, only, a, slight, majority, in, favour, of, secession, the, speaker, of, the, l, gting, together, with, the, majority, initiated, the, process, of, becoming, an, independent, state, the, minority, of, the, l,

l, gting, that, the, king, rejecting, the, majority, vote, had, dissolved, the, parliament, and, ordered, new, elections, a, parliamentary, election, was, held, a, few, months, later, in, which, the, political, parties, that, favoured, remaining, in, the, danish, kingdom, increased, their, share, of, the, vote, and, formed, a, coalition, based, on, this, they, chose, to, reject, secession, instead, a, compromise, was, reached, and, the, folketing, passed, a, home, rule, law, that, went, into, effect, in, 1948, the, faroe, islands, status, as, a, danish, amt, was, thereby, brought, to, an, end, the, faroe, islands, were, given, a, high, degree, of, self, governance, supported, by, a, financial, subsidy, from, denmark, to, recompense, expenses, the, islands, have, on, danish, services, in, protest, against, the, new, home, rule, act, republic, tj, veldi, was, founded, as, of, 2021, the, islanders, were, evenly, split, between, those, favouring, independence, and, those, who, prefer, to, continue, as, a, part, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, within, both, camps, there, is, a, wide, range, of, opinions, of, those, who, favour, independence, some, are, in, favour, of, an, immediate, unilateral, declaration, of, independence, others, see, independence, as, something, to, be, attained, gradually, and, with, the, full, consent, of, the, danish, government, and, the, danish, nation, in, the, unionist, camp, there, are, also, many, who, foresee, and, welcome, a, gradual, increase, in, autonomy, even, while, strong, ties, with, denmark, are, maintained, two, attempts, have, been, made, to, draft, a, separate, faroese, constitution, the, first, time, was, in, 2011, when, the, then, prime, minister, lars, l, kke, rasmussen, denounced, it, as, incompatible, with, denmark, s, constitution, stating, that, if, the, faroe, islands, wished, to, continue, with, the, move, they, must, declare, independence, a, second, attempt, was, made, in, 2015, facing, similar, criticisms, before, eventually, being, withdrawn, without, a, vote, as, explicitly, asserted, by, both, treaties, of, the, european, union, the, faroe, islands, are, not, part, of, the, european, union, the, faroes, are, not, grouped, with, the, eu, when, it, comes, to, international, trade, for, instance, when, the, eu, and, russia, imposed, reciprocal, trade, sanctions, on, each, other, over, the, war, in, donbas, in, 2014, the, faroes, began, exporting, significant, amounts, of, fresh, salmon, to, russia, moreover, a, protocol, to, the, treaty, of, accession, of, denmark, to, the, european, communities, stipulates, that, danish, nationals, residing, in, the, faroe, islands, are, not, considered, danish, nationals, within, the, meaning, of, the, treaties, hence, danish, people, living, in, the, faroes, are, not, citizens, of, the, european, union, though, other, eu, nationals, living, there, remain, eu, citizens, the, faroes, are, not, covered, by, the, schengen, agreement, but, there, are, no, border, checks, when, travelling, between, the, faroes, and, any, schengen, country, the, faroes, have, been, part, of, the, nordic, passport, union, since, 1966, and, since, 2001, there, have, been, no, permanent, border, checks, between, the, nordic, countries, and, the, rest, of, the, schengen, area, as, part, of, the, schengen, agreement, the, faroe, islands, are, not, fully, independent, but, they, do, have, political, relations, directly, with, other, countries, through, agreement, with, denmark, the, faroe, islands, are, a, member, of, some, international, organisations, as, though, they, were, an, independent, country, the, faroes, have, associate, membership, in, the, nordic, council, but, have, expressed, wishes, for, full, membership, the, faroe, islands, are, a, member, of, several, international, sports, federations, like, uefa, fifa, in, football, and, fina, in, swimming, and, ehf, in, handball, and, have, their, own, national,

own, agreements, with, other, countries, regarding, trade, and, commerce, when, the, european, union, imposed, sanctions, against, the, russian, federation, in, 2014, the, faroe, islands, were, not, a, part, of, the, embargo, because, they, are, not, a, part, of, eu, and, the, islands, had, just, themselves, experienced, a, year, of, embargo, from, the, eu, including, denmark, against, the, islands, the, faroese, prime, minister, kaj, leo, johannesen, went, to, moscow, to, negotiate, the, trade, between, russia, and, the, faroe, islands, the, faroese, minister, of, fisheries, negotiates, with, the, eu, and, other, countries, regarding, the, rights, to, fish, in, mid, 2005, representatives, of, the, faroe, islands, raised, the, possibility, of, their, territory, joining, the, european, free, trade, association, efta, according, to, article, 56, of, the, efta, convention, only, states, may, become, members, of, the, efta, the, faroes, are, an, autonomous, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, denmark, and, not, a, sovereign, state, in, their, own, right, consequently, they, considered, the, possibility, that, the, kingdom, of, denmark, in, respect, of, the, faroes, could, join, the, efta, though, the, danish, government, has, stated, that, this, mechanism, would, not, allow, the, faroes, to, become, a, separate, member, of, the, eea, because, denmark, was, already, a, party, to, the, eea, agreement, the, government, of, denmark, officially, supports, new, membership, of, the, efta, with, effect, for, the, faroe, islands, defence, is, the, responsibility, of, the, danish,

business, projects, to, attract, new, investment, the, introduction, of, burger, king, in, t, rshavn, was, widely, publicized, as, a, sign, of, the, globalization, of, faroese, culture, it, remains, to, be, seen, whether, these, projects, will, succeed, in, broadening, the, islands, economic, base, the, islands, have, one, of, the, lowest, unemployment, rates, in, europe, but, this, should, not, necessarily, be, taken, as, a, sign, of, a, recovering, economy, as, many, young, students, move, to, denmark, and, other, countries, after, leaving, high, school, this, leaves, a, largely, middle, aged, and, elderly, population, that, may, lack, the, skills, and, knowledge, to, fill, newly, developed, positions, on, the, faroes, nonetheless, in, 2008, the, faroes, were, able, to, make, a, 52,

in, the, nordic, culture, the, faroe, islands, were, long, isolated, from, the, main, cultural, phases, and, movements, that, swept, across, parts, of, europe, this, means, that, they, have, maintained, a, great, part, of, their, traditional, culture, the, language, spoken, is, faroese, which, is, one, of, three, insular, north, germanic, languages, descended, from, the, old, norse, language, spoken, in, scandinavia, in, the, viking, age, the, others, being, icelandic, and, the, extinct, norn, which, is, thought, to, have, been, mutually, intelligible, with, faroese, until, the, 15th, century, faroese, had, a, similar, orthography, to, icelandic, and, norwegian, but, after, the, reformation, in, 1538, the, ruling, norwegians, outlawed, its, use, in, schools, churches, and, official, documents, although, a, rich, spoken, tradition, survived, for, 300, years, the, language, was, not, written, down, this, means, that, all, poems, and, stories, were, handed, down, orally, these, works, were, split, into, the, following, divisions, sagnir, historical, vint, r, stories, and, kv, i, ballads, often, set, to, music, and, the, medieval, chain, dance, these, were, eventually, written, down, in, the, 19th, century, faroese, written, literature, has, developed, only, in, the, past, 100, 200, years, this, is, mainly, because, of, the, islands, isolation, and, also, because, the, faroese, language, did, not, have, a, standardised, writing, system, the, danish, language, was, also, encouraged, at, the, expense, of, faroese, nevertheless, the, faroes, have, produced, several, authors, and, poets, a, rich, centuries, old, oral, tradition, of, folk, tales, and, faroese, folk, songs, accompanied, the, faroese, chain, dance, the, people, learned, these, songs, and, stories, by, heart, and, told, or, sang, them, to, each, other, teaching, the, younger, generations, too, this, kind, of, literature, was, gathered, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century,
