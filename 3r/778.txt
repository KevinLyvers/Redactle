al, liy, on, the, opposing, river, bank, in, 809, and, moved, his, capital, here, from, walili, volubilis, 35, 35, 83, the, early, population, was, composed, mostly, of, berbers, along, with, hundreds, of, arab, warriors, from, kairouan, who, made, up, idris, ii, s, entourage, 35, 41, 82, arab, immigration, to, fez, increased, afterwards, andalusi, families, of, mixed, arab, and, iberian, descent, who, were, expelled, from, c, rdoba, after, a, rebellion, in, 817, 818, against, al, hakam, i, were, one, major, component, of, the, immigrant, population, these, families, mainly, settled, in, madinat, fas, 46, 47, these, two, waves, of, immigrants, gave, the, city, its, arabic, character, and, would, subsequently, give, their, name, to, the, districts, of, adwat, al, andalus, and,

proxies, of, c, rdoba, and, the, proxies, of, the, fatimids, for, many, decades, following, another, successful, invasion, by, buluggin, ibn, ziri, in, 979, and, a, brief, period, of, fatimid, control, the, forces, of, al, mansur, of, cordoba, managed, to, retake, the, region, again, expelling, the, fatimids, permanently, from, 980, or, from, 986, fez, was, ruled, by, a, zenata, dynasty, from, the, maghrawa, tribe, who, were, allies, of, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, they, maintained, this, control, even, after, the, caliphate, s, collapse, in, the, early, 11th, century, and, until, the, arrival, of, the, almoravids, 16, 91, fez, continued, to, grow, under, zenata, control, even, though, conflicts, between, its, two, settlements, madinat, fas, and, al, liy, flared, up, during, periods, of, political, rivalry, ziri, ibn, atiyya, the, first, ruler, of, the, new, dynasty, had, a, troubled, reign, 50, however, ibn, atiyya, s, descendant, dunas, ibn, hamama, ruling, between, 1037, and, 1049, was, responsible, for, improving, the, city, s, infrastructure, he, developed, much, of, fez, s, water, supply, system, which, has, largely, survived, up, to, the, present, day, other, structures, built, in, his, time, included, hammams, bathhouses, mosques, and, the, first, bridges, over, the, oued, bou, khrareb, mostly, rebuilt, in, later, eras, 51, the, two, cities, became, increasingly, integrated, the, open, space, between, the, two, was, filled, up, by, new, houses, and, up, to, six, bridges, across, the, river, allowed, for, easier, passage, between, them, 36, a, decade, after, dunas, between, 1059, and, 1061, the, two, cities, were, ruled, separately, by, two, brothers, who, were, rival, zenata, emirs, that, fought, with, each, other, al, liy, was, controlled, by, an, emir, named, al, gisa, and, madinat, fas, was, controlled, by, al, fetouh, both, brothers, fortified, their, respective, shores, and, their, names, have, been, preserved, in, two, of, the, city, s, gates, to, this, day, bab, guissa, or, bab, gisa, in, the, north, and, bab, ftouh, in, the, south, 31, 50, 53, 110, in, 1069, 1070, or, possibly, a, few, years, later, fez, was, conquered, by, the, almoravids, under, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, in, the, same, year, of, this, conquest, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, unified, madinat, fas, and, al, liy, into, one, city, the, walls, dividing, them, were, destroyed, bridges, connecting, them, were, built, or, renovated, and, a, new, circuit, of, walls, was, constructed, that, encompassed, both, cities, a, kasbah, arabic, term, for, citadel, was, built, at, the, western, edge, of, the, city, just, west, of, bab, bou, jeloud, today, to, house, the, city, s, governor, and, garrison, 53, although, the, capital, was, moved, to, marrakesh, under, the, almoravids, fez, acquired, a, reputation, for, maliki, legal, scholarship, and, remained, an, important, centre, of, trade, and, industry, 52, 54, 17, 18, almoravid, impact, on, the, city, s, structure, was, such, that, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, the, second, founder, of, fez, in, 1145, the, almohad, leader, abd, al, mu, min, besieged, and, conquered, the, city, during, the, almohad, overthrow, of, the, almoravids, due, to, the, ferocious, resistance, they, encountered, from, the, local, population, the, almohads, demolished, the, city, s, fortifications, 55, however, due, to, fez, s, continuing, economic, and, military, importance, the, almohad, caliph, ya, qub, al, mansur, ordered, the, reconstruction, of, the, ramparts, 36, 606, the, walls, were, completed, by, his, successor, muhammad, al, nasir, in, 1204, 36, giving, them, their, definitive, shape, and, establishing, the, perimeter, of, fes, el, bali, to, this, day, 56, 19, the, almohads, built, the, kasbah, bou, jeloud, on, the, site, of, the, former, almoravid, kasbah, 56, and, also, built, the, first, kasbah, occupying, the, site, of, the, current, kasbah, an, nouar, 72, 109, not, all, the, land, within, the, city, walls, was, densely, inhabited, much, of, it, was, still, relatively, open, and, was, occupied, by, crops, and, gardens, used, by, the, inhabitants, 19, during, the, 12th, century, the, city, was, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, with, an, estimated, population, of, 200, 000, by, 1200, fez, and, cairo, had, probably, become, the, largest, muslim, cities, in, 1250, fez, regained, its, status, as, the, capital, under, the, marinid, dynasty, the, city, reached, its, golden, age, in, the, marinid, period, 16, 61, 78, 20, in, 1276, an, anti, marinid, revolt, resulted, in, a, massacre, of, the, jewish, community, that, was, stopped, by, the, intervention, of, the, ruler, abu, yusuf, ya, qub, following, the, revolt, abu, yusuf, yaqub, founded, fes, jdid, as, the, new, administrative, and, military, centre, under, the, marinids, many, of, the, principal, monuments, in, the, medina, were, built, and, the, city, established, its, reputation, as, an, important, intellectual, centre, 61, 78, between, 1271, and, 1357, seven, madrasas, were, built, which, are, among, the, best, examples, of, moroccan, architecture, and, some, of, the, most, richly, decorated, monuments, in, fez, 285, 289, 291, 293, 312, 314, the, jewish, quarter, of, fez, the, mellah, was, created, in, fes, jdid, at, some, point, during, the, marinid, period, the, exact, date, and, circumstances, of, its, formation, are, not, firmly, established, but, many, scholars, date, the, transfer, of, the, jewish, population, from, fes, el, bali, to, the, new, mellah, to, the, 15th, century, a, period, of, political, tension, and, instability, in, particular, jewish, sources, describe, the, transfer, as, a, consequence, of, the, rediscovery, of, idris, ii, s, body, in, the, heart, of, the, city, in, 1437, which, caused, the, surrounding, area, if, not, the, entire, city, to, acquire, a, holy, haram, status, requiring, that, non, muslims, be, removed, from, the, area, the, moroccan, jewish, community, had, initially, consisted, of, indigenous, local, jews, known, as, the, toshavim, but, these, were, joined, by, western, sephardic, jews, fleeing, from, the, iberian, peninsula, known, as, the, megorashim, in, subsequent, generations, especially, after, the, 1492, expulsion, of, jews, from, spain, and, 1496, expulsion, of, jews, from, portugal, the, 1465, moroccan, revolt, overthrew, the, last, marinid, sultan, in, 1472, the, wattasids, another, zenata, dynasty, which, had, previously, served, as, viziers, under, the, marinid, sultans, succeeded, as, rulers, of, morocco, from, fez, 114, 115, they, perpetuated, the, structure, of, the, marinid, state, and, continued, its, policies, but, were, unable, to, control, all, of, morocco, 15, 207, 209, they, did, not, contribute, significantly, to, the, physical, fabric, of, fez, in, the, 16th, century, the, saadis, a, dynasty, claiming, prophetic, heritage, rose, to, power, in, southern, morocco, and, challenged, the, wattasids, around, the, same, time, the, ottoman, empire, came, close, to, fez, after, its, conquest, of, algeria, in, january, 1549, the, saadi, sultan, mohammed, ash, sheikh, took, fez, and, ousted, the, last, wattasid, sultan, ali, abu, hassun, the, wattasids, later, retook, the, city, in, 1554, with, ottoman, support, but, this, reconquest, was, short, lived, and, later, that, same, year, the, wattasids, were, decisively, defeated, by, the, saadis, 157, the, ottomans, attempted, to, invade, morocco, after, the, assassination, of, mohammed, ash, sheikh, in, 1558, but, were, stopped, by, his, son, abdallah, al, ghalib, at, the, battle, of, wadi, al, laban, north, of, fez, 158, after, the, death, of, abdallah, al, ghalib, a, new, power, struggle, emerged, abd, al, malik, abdallah, s, brother, captured, fez, with, ottoman, support, and, ousted, his, nephew, abu, abdullah, from, the, throne, this, led, to, the, battle, of, wadi, al, makhazin, also, known, as, battle, of, the, three, kings, in, which, abd, al, malik, s, army, defeated, an, invading, portuguese, army, ensuring, moroccan, independence, abd, al, malik, was, killed, during, the, battle, and, was, succeeded, by, ahmad, al, mansur, r, 1578, 1603, the, saadis, who, used, marrakesh, again, as, their, capital, did, not, lavish, much, attention, on, fez, with, the, exception, of, the, ornate, ablutions, pavilions, added, to, the, qarawiyyin, mosque, s, courtyard, during, their, time, 70, perhaps, as, a, result, of, persistent, tensions, with, the, city, s, inhabitants, the, saadis, built, a, number, of, new, forts, and, bastions, around, the, city, which, appear, to, have, been, aimed, at, keeping, control, over, the, local, population, after, the, long, reign, of, ahmad, al, mansur, the, saadi, state, fell, into, civil, war, between, his, sons, and, potential, successors, fez, became, a, rival, seat, of, power, for, a, number, of, brothers, vying, against, other, family, members, ruling, from, marrakesh, both, cities, changed, hands, multiple, times, until, the, internecine, conflict, finally, ended, in, 1627, despite, the, reunification, of, the, realm, after, 1627, the, saadis, were, in, full, decline, and, fez, had, already, suffered, considerably, from, the, repeated, conquests, and, reconquests, during, the, conflict, in, 1641, muhammad, al, haj, of, the, sanhaja, dil, sufi, order, occupied, fez, 88, the, time, was, particularly, difficult, for, fessi, jews, 88, it, was, only, when, the, founder, of, the, alawi, dynasty, moulay, rashid, took, fez, in, 1666, that, the, city, saw, a, revival, and, became, the, capital, again, albeit, briefly, 25, moulay, rashid, set, about, restoring, the, city, after, a, long, period, of, neglect, he, built, the, kasbah, cherarda, also, known, as, the, kasbah, al, khemis, to, the, north, of, fes, jdid, in, order, to, house, a, large, part, of, his, tribal, troops, 84, 25, he, also, restored, or, rebuilt, what, became, known, as, the, kasbah, an, nouar, which, became, the, living, quarters, of, his, followers, from, the, tafilalt, region, the, alawi, dynasty, s, ancestral, home, 84, 72, 73, moulay, rashid, also, built, a, large, new, madrasa, the, cherratine, madrasa, in, 1670, after, rashid, s, death, fez, underwent, another, dark, period, moulay, isma, il, his, successor, apparently, disliked, the, city, possibly, due, to, a, rebellion, there, in, his, early, reign, and, chose, nearby, mekn, s, as, his, capital, instead, 84, although, he, did, restore, or, rebuild, some, major, monuments, in, the, city, such, as, the, zawiya, of, moulay, idris, ii, he, also, frequently, imposed, heavy, taxes, on, the, city, s, inhabitants, and, sometimes, even, forcibly, transferred, parts, of, its, population, to, repopulate, other, cities, in, the, country, 84, 85, after, his, death, morocco, was, plunged, into, anarchy, and, decades, of, conflict, between, his, sons, who, vied, to, succeed, him, fez, suffered, particularly, from, repeated, conflicts, with, the, udayas, or, oudayas, a, guich, tribe, vassal, tribe, serving, as, a, garrison, and, military, force, previously, installed, in, the, kasbah, cherarda, by, moulay, isma, il, sultan, moulay, abdallah, who, reigned, intermittently, during, this, period, and, used, fez, as, a, capital, was, initially, welcomed, in, 1728, 29, as, an, enemy, of, the, udayas, but, relations, between, him, and, the, city, s, population, quickly, soured, due, to, his, choice, of, governor, he, immediately, built, a, separate, fortified, palace, in, the, countryside, dar, dbibegh, where, he, resided, instead, for, nearly, three, more, decades, the, city, remained, in, more, or, less, perpetual, conflict, with, both, the, udayas, and, the, alawi, sultans, 85, 86, starting, with, the, reign, of, moulay, muhammad, ibn, abdallah, between, 1757, and, 1790, the, country, stabilized, and, fez, finally, regained, its, fortunes, although, its, status, was, partly, shared, with, marrakesh, it, remained, the, capital, of, morocco, for, the, rest, of, the, alawi, period, up, to, the, 20th, century, 88, 25, 26, the, alawis, continued, to, rebuild, or, restore, various, monuments, and, undertook, a, series, of, extensions, to, the, royal, palace, the, sultans, and, their, entourages, also, became, more, and, more, closely, associated, with, the, elites, of, fez, and, other, urban, centers, with, the, ulama, religious, scholars, of, fez, being, particularly, influential, after, moulay, slimane, s, death, powerful, families, from, fez, became, the, main, players, of, the, country, s, political, and, intellectual, scene, 242, 247, the, tijani, sufi, order, started, by, ahmad, al, tijani, d, 1815, has, had, its, spiritual, center, in, fez, since, al, tijani, moved, here, from, algeria, in, 1789, 244, the, order, spread, quickly, among, the, literary, elite, of, north, west, africa, and, its, ulama, had, significant, religious, intellectual, and, political, influence, in, fez, and, beyond, until, the, 19th, century, the, city, was, the, only, source, of, fezzes, also, known, as, the, tarboosh, the, last, major, change, to, fez, s, topography, before, the, 20th, century, was, made, during, the, reign, of, moulay, hassan, i, 1873, 1894, who, finally, connected, fes, jdid, and, fes, el, bali, by, building, a, walled, corridor, between, them, 89, 25, 26, new, gardens, and, summer, palaces, used, by, the, royals, and, the, capital, s, high, society, were, built, within, the, corridor, such, as, the, jnan, sbil, gardens, and, the, dar, batha, palace, 89, 90, moulay, hassan, also, expanded, the, old, royal, palace, itself, extending, its, entrance, up, to, the, current, location, of, the, old, mechouar, while, adding, the, new, mechouar, along, with, the, dar, al, makina, to, the, north, the, expansion, separated, the, moulay, abdallah, neighbourhood, to, the, northwest, from, the, rest, of, fes, jdid, fez, played, a, central, role, in, the, hafidhiya, the, brief, civil, war, that, erupted, when, abdelhafid, challenged, his, brother, abdelaziz, for, the, throne, the, ulama, of, fez, led, by, the, sufi, modernist, muhammad, bin, abdul, kabir, al, kattani, offered, their, conditioned, support, to, abd, al, hafid, which, turned, the, tide, of, the, conflict, abdelaziz, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, marrakesh, in, 1908, 76, 78, abdelhafid, s, reign, soon, deteriorated, and, in, early, 1911, the, sultan, was, besieged, in, fez, by, the, tribes, of, the, middle, atlas, abdelhafid, appealed, for, french, help, and, a, french, force, under, colonel, charles, mile, moinier, arrived, in, fez, on, may, 21, and, established, a, command, centre, at, dar, dbibegh, 313, 78, in, 1912, french, colonial, rule, was, instituted, over, morocco, following, the, treaty, of, fes, one, immediate, consequence, was, the, 1912, riots, in, fez, a, popular, uprising, which, included, deadly, attacks, targeting, europeans, as, well, as, native, jewish, inhabitants, in, the, mellah, followed, by, an, even, deadlier, repression, the, first, french, resident, general, hubert, lyautey, decided, to, move, the, administrative, capital, of, the, protectorate, to, rabat, in, 1912, 1913, which, has, remained, the, capital, ever, since, 149, a, number, of, social, and, physical, changes, took, place, during, this, period, and, across, the, 20th, century, starting, under, lyautey, one, important, policy, with, long, term, consequences, was, the, decision, to, largely, forego, redevelopment, of, existing, historic, walled, cities, in, morocco, and, to, intentionally, preserve, them, as, sites, of, historic, heritage, still, known, today, as, medinas, instead, the, french, administration, built, new, modern, cities, the, villes, nouvelles, just, outside, the, old, cities, where, european, settlers, largely, resided, with, modern, western, style, amenities, this, was, part, of, a, larger, policy, of, association, adopted, by, lyautey, which, favoured, various, forms, of, indirect, colonial, rule, by, preserving, local, institutions, and, elites, in, contrast, with, other, french, colonial, policies, that, had, favoured, assimilation, the, ville, nouvelle, also, became, known, as, dar, dbibegh, by, moroccans, as, the, former, palace, of, moulay, abdallah, was, located, in, the, same, area, the, creation, of, the, separate, french, ville, nouvelle, to, the, west, had, a, wider, impact, on, the, entire, city, s, development, while, new, colonial, policies, preserved, historic, monuments, they, stalled, urban, development, in, heritage, areas, scholar, janet, abu, lughod, has, argued, that, these, policies, created, a, kind, of, urban, apartheid, between, the, indigenous, moroccan, urban, areas, who, were, forced, to, remain, stagnant, in, terms, of, urban, development, and, architectural, innovation, and, the, new, mainly, european, inhabited, planned, cities, which, expanded, to, occupy, lands, formerly, used, by, moroccans, outside, the, city, 165, 166, this, separation, was, partly, softened, however, by, wealthy, moroccans, who, started, moving, into, the, ville, nouvelles, during, this, period, 26, by, contrast, the, old, city, medina, of, fez, was, increasingly, settled, by, poorer, rural, migrants, from, the, countryside, 26, fez, also, played, a, role, in, the, moroccan, nationalist, movement, and, in, protests, against, the, french, colonial,

nationalists, gathered, in, fez, to, draft, a, demand, for, independence, which, they, submitted, to, the, allies, on, january, 11, 1944, this, resulted, in, the, arrest, of, nationalist, leaders, followed, by, the, violent, suppression, of, protests, across, many, cities, including, fez, 255, after, morocco, regained, its, independence, in, 1956, many, of, the, trends, begun, under, colonial,
