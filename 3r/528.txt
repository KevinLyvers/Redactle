from, uruk, refer, to, a, place, called, dilmun, associated, on, several, occasions, with, copper, and, in, later, periods, it, was, a, source, of, imported, woods, in, southern, mesopotamia, scholars, have, suggested, that, dilmun, originally, designated, the, eastern, province, of, saudi, arabia, notably, linked, with, the, major, dilmunite, settlements, of, umm, an, nussi, and, umm, ar, ramadh, in, the, interior, and, tarout, on, the, coast, it, is, likely, that, tarout, island, was, the, main, port, and, the, capital, of, dilmun, mesopotamian, inscribed, clay, tablets, suggest, that, in, the, early, period, of, dilmun, a, form, of, hierarchical, organized, political, structure, existed, in, 1966, an, earthwork, in, tarout, exposed, an, ancient, burial, field, that, yielded, a, large, statue, dating, to, the, dilmunite, period, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, statue, was, locally, made, under, the, strong, mesopotamian, influence, on, the, artistic, principle, of, dilmun, by, 2200, bc, the, centre, of, dilmun, shifted, for, unknown, reasons, from, tarout, and, the, saudi, arabian, mainland, to, the, island, of, bahrain, and, a, highly, developed, settlement, emerged, there, where, a, laborious, temple, complex, and, thousands, of, burial, mounds, dating, to, this, period, were, discovered, by, the, late, bronze, age, a, historically, recorded, people, and, land,

politically, the, midianites, were, described, as, having, a, decentralized, structure, headed, by, five, kings, evi, rekem, tsur, hur, and, reba, the, names, appears, to, be, toponyms, of, important, midianite, settlements, it, is, common, to, view, that, midian, designated, a, confederation, of, tribes, the, sedentary, element, settled, in, the, hijaz, while, its, nomadic, affiliates, pastured, and, sometimes, pillaged, as, far, away, as, palestine, the, nomadic, midianites, were, one, of, the, earliest, exploiters, of, the, domestication, of, camels, that, enabled, them, to, navigate, through, the, harsh, terrains, of, the, region, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, bc, an, emerging, kingdom, appeared, in, north, western, arabia, it, started, as, a, sheikdom, of, dedan, which, developed, into, the, kingdom, of, lihyan, during, this, period, dedan, transformed, into, a, kingdom, that, encompassed, a, much, wider, domain, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, with, bustling, economic, activity, between, the, south, and, north, lihyan, acquired, large, influence, suitable, to, its, strategic, position, on, the, caravan, road, the, lihyanites, ruled, over, a, large, domain, from, yathrib, in, the, south, and, parts, of, the, levant, in, the, north, in, antiquity, gulf, of, aqaba, used, to, be, called, gulf, of, lihyan, a, testimony, to, the, extensive, influence, that, lihyan, acquired, the, lihyanites, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, nabataeans, around, 65, bc, upon, their, seizure, of, hegra, then, marching, to, tayma, and, to, their, capital, dedan, in, 9, bc, the, nabataeans, ruled, large, portions, of, north, arabia, until, their, domain, was, annexed, by, the, roman, empire, which, renamed, it, arabia, petraea, and, remained, under, the, rule, of, the, romans, until, 630, shortly, before, the, advent, of, islam, apart, from, urban, trading, settlements, such, as, mecca, and, medina, much, of, what, was, to, become, saudi, arabia, was, populated, by,

661, 750, abbasid, 750, 1517, and, the, fatimid, 909, 1171, caliphates, from, the, 10th, century, to, the, early, 20th, century, mecca, and, medina, were, under, the, control, of, a, local, arab, ruler, known, as, the, sharif, of, mecca, but, at, most, times, the, sharif, owed, allegiance, to, the, ruler, of, one, of, the, major, islamic, empires, based, in, baghdad, cairo, or, istanbul, most, of, the, remainder, of, what, became, saudi, arabia, reverted, to, traditional, tribal, rule, for, much, of, the, 10th, century, the, isma, ili, shi, ite, qarmatians, were, the, most, powerful, force, in, the, persian, gulf, in, 930, the, qarmatians, pillaged, mecca, outraging, the, muslim, world, particularly, with, their, theft, of, the, black, stone, in, 1077, 1078, an, arab, sheikh, named,

the, region, after, overthrowing, the, jarwanids, in, the, 15th, century, and, clashed, with, hormuz, for, more, than, two, decades, over, the, region, for, its, economic, revenues, until, finally, agreeing, to, pay, tribute, in, 1507, al, muntafiq, tribe, later, took, over, the, region, and, came, under, ottoman, suzerainty, the, bani, khalid, tribe, later, revolted, against, them, in, the, 17th, century, and, took, control, their, rule, extended, from, iraq, to, oman, at, its, height, and, they, too, came, under, ottoman, suzerainty, in, the, 16th, century, the, ottomans, added, the, red, sea, and, persian, gulf, coast, the, hejaz, asir, and, al, ahsa, to, the, empire, and, claimed, suzerainty, over, the, interior, one, reason, was, to, thwart, portuguese, attempts, to, attack, the, red, sea, hence, the, hejaz, and, the, indian, ocean, the, ottoman, degree, of, control, over, these, lands, varied, over, the, next, four, centuries, with, the, fluctuating, strength, or, weakness, of, the, empire, s, central, authority, these, changes, contributed, to, later, uncertainties, such, as, the, dispute, with, transjordan, over, the, inclusion, of, the, sanjak, of, ma, an,

with, ibn, saud, s, opposition, as, he, recognized, the, danger, of, a, direct, conflict, with, the, british, at, the, same, time, the, ikhwan, became, disenchanted, with, ibn, saud, s, domestic, policies, which, appeared, to, favour, modernization, and, the, increase, in, the, number, of, non, muslim, foreigners, in, the, country, as, a, result, they, turned, against, ibn, saud, and, after, a, two, year, struggle, were, defeated, in, 1929, at, the, battle, of, sabilla, where, their, leaders, were, massacred, on, ibn, saud, s, behalf, prince, faisal, declared, the, unification, on, 23,

and, substantial, political, leverage, internationally, cultural, life, rapidly, developed, primarily, in, the, hejaz, which, was, the, centre, for, newspapers, and, radio, however, the, large, influx, of, foreign, workers, in, saudi, arabia, in, the, oil, industry, increased, the, pre, existing, propensity, for, xenophobia, at, the, same, time, the, government, became, increasingly, wasteful, and, extravagant, by, the, 1950s, this, had, led, to, large, governmental, deficits, and, excessive, foreign, borrowing, in, 1953, saud, of, saudi, arabia, succeeded, as, the, king, of, saudi, arabia, in, 1964, he, was, deposed, in, favour, of, his, half, brother, faisal, of, saudi, arabia, after, an, intense, rivalry, fuelled, by, doubts, in, the, royal, family, over, saud, s, competence, in, 1972, saudi, arabia, gained, a, 20, control, in, aramco, thereby, decreasing, us, control, over, saudi, oil, in, 1973, saudi, arabia, led, an, oil, boycott, against, the, western, countries, that, supported, israel, in, the, yom, kippur, war, against, egypt, and, syria, leading, to, the, quadrupling, of, oil, prices, in, 1975, faisal, was, assassinated, by, his, nephew, prince,

developed, in, 1979, two, events, occurred, which, greatly, concerned, the, government, and, had, a, long, term, influence, on, saudi, foreign, and, domestic, policy, the, first, was, the, iranian, islamic, revolution, it, was, feared, that, the, country, s, shi, ite, minority, in, the, eastern, province, which, is, also, the, location, of, the, oil, fields, might, rebel, under, the, influence, of, their, iranian, co, religionists, there, were, several, anti, government, uprisings, in, the, region, such, as, the, 1979, qatif, uprising, the, second, event, was, the, grand, mosque, seizure, in, mecca, by, islamist, extremists, the, militants, involved, were, in, part, angered, by, what, they, considered, to, be, the, corruption, and, un, islamic, nature, of, the, saudi, government, the, government, regained, control, of, the, mosque, after, 10, days, and, those, captured, were, executed, part, of, the, response, of, the, royal, family, was, to, enforce, the, much, stricter, observance, of, traditional, religious, and, social, norms, in, the, country, for, example, the, closure, of, cinemas, and, to, give, the, ulema, a, greater, role, in, government, neither, entirely, succeeded, as, islamism, continued, to, grow, in, strength, in, 1980, saudi, arabia, bought, out, the, american, interests, in, aramco, king, khalid, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, june, 1982, he, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, king, fahd, who, added, the, title, custodian, of, the, two, holy, mosques, to, his, name, in, 1986, in, response, to, considerable, fundamentalist, pressure, to,

the, judicial, and, education, systems, and, a, monopoly, of, authority, in, religious, and, social, morals, by, the, 1970s, as, a, result, of, oil, wealth, and, the, modernization, initiated, by, king, faisal, important, changes, to, saudi, society, were, underway, and, the, power, of, the, ulema, was, in, decline, however, this, changed, following, the, seizure, of, the, grand, mosque, in, mecca, in, 1979, by, islamist, radicals, the, government, s, response, to, the, crisis, included, strengthening, the, ulema, s, powers, and, increasing, their, financial, support, in, particular, they, were, given, greater, control, over, the, education, system, and, allowed, to, enforce, the, stricter, observance, of, wahhabi, rules, of, moral, and, social, behaviour, after, his, accession, to, the, throne, in, 2005, king, abdullah, took, steps, to, reduce, the, powers, of, the, ulema, for, instance, transferring, control, over, girls, education, to, the, ministry, of, education, the,

century, founder, of, the, wahhabi, form, of, sunni, islam, which, is, today, dominant, in, saudi, arabia, the, family, is, second, in, prestige, only, to, the, al, saud, the, royal, family, with, whom, they, formed, a, mutual, support, pact, and, power, sharing, arrangement, nearly, 300, years, ago, the, pact, which, persists, to, this, day, is, based, on, the, al, saud, maintaining, the, al, ash, sheikh, s, authority, in, religious, matters, and, upholding, and, propagating, wahhabi, doctrine, in, return, the, al, ash, sheikh, support, the, al, saud, s, political, authority, thereby, using, its, religious, moral, authority, to, legitimize, the, royal, family, s, rule, although, the, al, ash, sheikh, s, domination, of, the, ulema, has, diminished, in, recent, decades, they, still, hold, the, most, important, religious, posts, and, are, closely, linked, to, the, al, saud, by, a, high, degree, of, intermarriage, the, primary, source, of, law, is, the, islamic, sharia, derived, from, the, teachings, of, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, the, traditions, of, the, prophet, saudi, arabia, is, unique, among, modern, muslim, states, in, that, sharia, is, not, codified, and, there, is, no, system, of, judicial, precedent, allowing, judges, to, use, independent, legal, reasoning, to, make, a, decision, thus, divergent, judgments, arise, even, in, apparently, identical, cases,

noted, for, its, literalist, interpretation, of, the, qur, an, and, hadith, however, in, 2021, saudi, arabia, announced, judicial, reforms, which, will, lead, to, an, entirely, codified, law, that, eliminates, discrepancies, royal, decrees, are, the, other, main, source, of, law, but, are, referred, to, as, regulations, rather, than, laws, because, they, are, subordinate, to, the, sharia, royal,
