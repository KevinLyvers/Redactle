through, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, for, some, 4, 880, kilometres, 3, 030, mi, among, south, american, rivers, it, is, second, in, length, only, to, the, amazon, river, it, merges, with, the, paraguay, river, and, then, farther, downstream, with, the, uruguay, river, to, form, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, empties, into, the, atlantic, ocean, the, first, european, to, go, up, the, paran, river, was, the, venetian, explorer, sebastian, cabot, in, 1526, while, working, for, spain, a, drought, hit, the, river, in, 2021, causing, a, 77, year, low, in, eastern, south, america, there, is, an, immense, number, of, river, names, containing, the, element, para, or, parana, from, guarani, language, words, meaning, river, or, sea, attempts, to, derive, a, more, precise, meaning, for, the, name, of, this, the, largest, of, them, e, g, kin, of, the, sea, have, been, discounted, the, course, is, formed, at, the, confluence, of, the, paranaiba, and, rio, grande, rivers, in, southern, brazil, from, the, confluence, the, river, flows, in, a, generally, southwestern, direction, for, about, 619, km, 385, mi, before, encountering, the, city, of, saltos, del, guaira, paraguay, this, was, once, the, location, of, the, gua, ra, falls, sete, quedas, waterfalls, where, the, paran, fell, over, a, series, of, seven, cascades, this, natural, feature, was, said, to, rival, the, world, famous, iguazu, falls, to, the, south, the, falls, were, flooded, however, by, the, construction, of, the, itaipu, dam, which, began, operating, in, 1984, for, approximately, the, next, 200, km, 120, mi, the, paran, flows, southward, and, forms, a, natural, boundary, between, paraguay, and, brazil, until, the, confluence, with, the, iguazu, river, further, upstream, from, this, confluence, however, the, river, is, dammed, by, the, itaipu, dam, the, second, largest, hydroelectric, power, plant, in, the, world, following, the, three, gorges, dam, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, creating, a, massive, shallow, reservoir, behind, it, after, merging, with, the, iguazu, the, paran, becomes, the, natural, border, between, paraguay, and, argentina, overlooking, the, paran, river, from, encarnaci, n, paraguay, across, the, river, is, downtown, posadas, argentina, the, river, continues, its, general, southward, course, for, about, 468, km, 291, mi, before, making, a, gradual, turn, to, the, west, for, another, 820, km, 510, mi, and, then, encounters, the, paraguay, river, the, largest, tributary, along, the, course, of, the, river, before, this, confluence, the, river, passes, through, a, second, major, hydroelectric, project, the, yacyret, dam, a, joint, project, between, paraguay, and, argentina, the, massive, reservoir, formed, by, the, project, has, been, the, source, of, a, number, of, problems, for, people, living, along, the, river, most, notably, the, poorer, merchants, and, residents, in, the, low, lying, areas, of, encarnaci, n, a, major, city, on, the, southern, border, of, paraguay, river, levels, rose, dramatically, upon, completion, of, the, dam, flooding, out, large, sections, of, the, city, s, lower, areas, from, the, confluence, with, the, paraguay, river, the, paran, again, turns, to, the, south, for, another, approximately, 820, km, 510, mi, through, argentina, making, a, slow, turn, back, to, the, east, near, the, city, of, rosario, for, the, final, stretch, of, less, than, 500, km, 310, mi, before, merging, with, the, uruguay, river, to, form, the, r, o, de, la, plata, this, flows, into, the, atlantic, ocean, during, the, part, of, its, course, downstream, from, the, city, of, diamante, entre, r, os, it, splits, into, several, arms, and, it, forms, the, paran, delta, the, main, tributaries, from, the, mouth,

arantes, period, 1971, 2000, together, with, its, tributaries, the, rio, paran, forms, a, massive, drainage, basin, that, encompasses, much, of, the, southcentral, part, of, south, america, essentially, including, all, of, paraguay, much, of, southern, brazil, northern, argentina, and, the, southeastern, part, of, bolivia, if, the, uruguay, river, is, counted, as, a, tributary, to, the, paran, this, watershed, extends, to, cover, most, of, uruguay, as, well, the, volume, of, water, flowing, into, the, atlantic, ocean, through, the, r, o, de, la, plata, roughly, equals, the, volume, at, the, mississippi, river, delta, this, watershed, contains, a, number, of, large, cities, including, s, o, paulo, buenos, aires, rosario, asunci, n, bras, lia, and, la, plata, the, paran, and, its, tributaries, provide, a, source, of, income, and, of, daily, sustenance, for, fishermen, who, live, along, its, banks, some, of, the, species, of, fish, such, as, the, surub, and, the, s, balo, are, commercially, important, and, they, are, exploited, for, heavy, internal, consumption, or, for, export, the, parana, river, delta, ranks, as, one, of, the, world, s, greatest, bird, watching, destinations, much, of, the, length, of, the, paran, is, navigable, and, the, river, serves, as, an, important, waterway, linking, inland, cities, in, argentina, and, paraguay, with, the, ocean, providing, deepwater, ports, in, some, of, these, cities, the, construction, of, enormous, hydroelectric, dams, along, the, river, s, length, has, blocked, its, use, as, a, shipping, corridor, to, cities, further, upstream, but, the, economic, impact, of, those, dams, offsets, this, the, yacyret, dam, and, the, itaipu, dam, on, the, paraguay, border, have, made, the, small, largely, undeveloped, nation, of, paraguay, the, world, s, largest, exporter, of, hydroelectric, power, due, to, its, use, for, oceangoing, ships, measurements, of, the, water, tables, extend, back, to, 1904,
