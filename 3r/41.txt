been, a, 60, population, growth, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, since, 2000, which, consequently, leads, people, to, resort, to, hijacking, kidnapping, robberies, and, more, due, to, food, shortages, climate, change, has, become, a, huge, problem, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, and, as, a, consequence, has, different, maritime, security, issues, become, more, pressing, these, maritime, security, crimes, are, characterized, not, only, by, piracy, but, by, a, myriad, of, maritime, crimes, despite, piracy, often, dominating, the, conversation, on, maritime, security, the, other, notable, crimes, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, are, illegal, fishing, kidnapping, for, ransom, drug, trafficking, and, oil, bunkering, illegal, oil, bunkering, consists, of, the, attacking, of, vessels, transporting,

the, nigerian, waters, kidnapping, for, ransom, is, also, one, of, the, most, prevalent, maritime, crimes, in, the, region, between, 2018, and, 2019, the, number, of, crew, members, that, were, kidnapped, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, increased, by, 50, leading, the, region, to, account, for, 90, of, global, kidnappings, at, sea, about, 92, of, the, hostage, taking, and, 73, of, kidnappings, happening, in, and, around, africa, are, happening, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, there, is, also, a, large, issue, of, drug, trafficking, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, and, the, region, has, over, the, last, few, years, become, a, haven, for, drug, trafficking, mainly, from, south, america, into, europe, iuu, fishing, also, known, as, illegal, unreported, and, unregulated, fishing, has, become, a, severe, problem, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, in, 2000, were, there, reports, of, 212, 800, tons, of, fish, caught, and, in, 2012, has, this, number, increased, by, 9, percent, to, 232, 200, tons, iuu, consequently, creates, spillover, problems, to, the, social, economic, and, environmental, life, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, it, presents, a, direct, threat, to, the, national, security, of, the, coastal, states, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, iuu, has, been, linked, to, multiple, issues, and, forms, of, organized, crime, some, of, these, crimes, are, arms, trafficking, drug, smuggling, forced, labor, piracy, and, more, iuu, depletes, fish, stocks, in, the, area, and, causes, issues, for, fishermen, and, the, local, population, s, food, security, one, of, the, main, issues, of, iuu, is, that, a, lot, of, the, fish, that, is, caught, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, is, fish, that, is, unreported, when, caught, this, causes, overfishing, and, overfishing, causes, depleting, fisheries, all, around, the, region, iuu, fishing, also, becomes, a, severe, issue, in, the, region, because, it, allows, fishermen, to, fish, in, vessels, that, are, not, nationally, regulated, or, managed, furthermore, can, these, vessels, threaten, people, s, human, security, due, to, poor, working, conditions, and, poorly, regulated, boats, many, of, the, iuu, fishing, boats, are, old, rusty, and, often, in, poor, condition, both, small, scale, and, large, scale, fisheries, often, do, illegal, fishing, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, can, we, see, severe, blue, crime, spillover, effects, of, iuu, through, both, piracy, and, human, trafficking, economic, activity, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, has, given, rise, to, maritime, piracy, in, the, region, it, is, evident, that, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, is, there, more, piracy, forced, labor, and, human, trafficking, as, a, consequence, of, iuu, fishing, depleting, fish, stock, and, large, competition, of, resources, and, food, there, have, been, many, reports, of, forced, labor, at, sea, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, on, illegal, fishing, boats, the, ejf, reports, that, through, their, studies, they, found, that, some, fishermen, and, immigrant, workers, have, been, forced, to, work, on, fishing, boats, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, for, months, at, a, time, without, access, to, land, some, of, these, workers, were, deployed, to, sea, each, day, in, canoes, and, in, the, night, where, they, were, forced, to, return, to, the, mother, ship, to, unload, fish, many, illegal, fishing, boats, have, operated, like, such, for, many, years, and, the, workers, are, often, contracted, for, two, years, at, a, time, with, no, chance, to, visit, home, or, at, times, even, land, in, general, many, workers, are, paid, in, boxes, of, what, the, ejf, called, trash, fish, caught, as, by, catch, and, then, the, way, they, would, earn, money, was, to, further, sell, this, fish, other, reports, of, forced, labor, on, illegal, fishing, boats, report, poor, and, non, existent, safety, equipment, little, to, no, hygiene, standards, poor, accommodation, standards, and, very, little, food, even, though, piracy, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, has, dropped, since, its, peak, in, 2020, is, it, still, a, pressing, issue, in, the, region, many, pirate, groups, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, often, recruit, unemployed, and, underemployed, fishermen, this, has, become, highly, lucrative, due, to, poor, wages, and, little, to, no, money, going, around, often, have, these, local, fishermen, been, lured, into, the, prospect, of, quick, easy, money, and, as, a, result, sold, their, fishing, boats, to, other, pirates, in, the, gulf, depliting, fishing, stocks, encourages, fishermen, to, engage, in, piracy, and, more, violence, in, the, region, is, occurring
