subregion, of, the, americas, that, includes, the, caribbean, sea, and, its, islands, some, of, which, are, surrounded, by, the, caribbean, sea, and, some, of, which, border, both, the, caribbean, sea, and, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, nearby, coastal, areas, on, the, mainland, are, sometimes, also, included, in, the, region, the, region, is, south, east, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, northern, america, east, of, central, america, and, north, of, south, america, situated, largely, on, the, caribbean, plate, the, region, has, thousands, of, islands, islets, reefs, and, cays, island, arcs, delineate, the, northern, and, eastern, edges, of, the, caribbean, sea, the, greater, antilles, in, the, north, and, the, lesser, antilles, which, includes, the, leeward, antilles, in, the, east, and, south, the, nearby, lucayan, archipelago, comprising, the, bahamas, and, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, and, the, island, of, barbados, in, the, lesser, antilles, are, considered, to, be, a, part, of, the, caribbean, despite, not, bordering, the, caribbean, sea, all, the, islands, in, the, antilles, plus, the, lucayan, archipelago, form, the, west, indies, which, is, often, interchangeable, with, the, term, caribbean, on, the, mainland, belize, and, the, caribbean, coasts, of, mexico, central, america, and, south, america, including, the, yucat, n, peninsula, of, mexico,

guyana, panama, and, suriname, are, often, included, as, parts, of, the, caribbean, due, to, their, political, and, cultural, ties, with, the, region, geopolitically, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, are, often, regarded, as, a, subregion, of, north, america, though, sometimes, they, are, included, in, middle, america, or, left, as, a, subregion, of, their, own, alternately, the, term, caribbean, may, have, the, intended, exclusion, or, even, unintentional, inclusion, as, part, of, latin, america, generally, the, caribbean, area, is, organized, into, 33, political, entities, including, 13, sovereign, states, 12, dependencies, historical, disputed, territories, have, existed, and, seven, other, overseas, territories, from, 15, december, 1954, to, 10, october, 2010, there, was, a, territory, known, as, the, netherlands, antilles, composed, of, five, islands, all, of, which, were, dutch, dependencies, from, 3, january, 1958, to, 31, may, 1962, there, was, also, a, short, lived, political, union, called, the, british, west, indies, federation, composed, of, ten, english, speaking, caribbean, territories, all, of, which, were, then, british, dependencies, because, of, a, history, of, waves, of, immigration, brought, by, colonization, by, the, spanish, english, dutch, and, french, the, atlantic, slave, trade, from, africa, and, indentured, servitude, from, asia, as, well, as, modern, immigration, the, modern, caribbean, is, one, of, the, most, ethnically, diverse, regions, on, the, planet, with, persons, of, all, these, ethnic, backgrounds, the, region, takes, its, name, from, that, of, the, caribs, an, ethnic, group, present, in, the, lesser, antilles, and, parts, of, adjacent, south, america, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, americas, the, two, most, prevalent, pronunciations, of, caribbean, outside, the, caribbean, are, k, r, b, i, n, karr, bee, n, with, the, primary, stress, on, the, third, syllable, and, k, r, b, i, n, k, rib, ee, n, with, the, stress, on, the, second, most, authorities, of, the, last, century, preferred, the, stress, on, the, third, syllable, this, is, the, older, of, the, two, pronunciations, but, the, stressed, second, syllable, variant, has, been, established, for, over, 75, years, it, has, been, suggested, that, speakers, of, british, english, prefer, k, r, b, i, n, karr, bee, n, while, north, american, speakers, more, typically, use, k, r, b, i, n, k, rib, ee, n, but, major, american, dictionaries, and, other, sources, list, the, stress, on, the, third, syllable, as, more, common, in, american, english, too, according, to, the, american, version, of, oxford, online, dictionaries, the, stress, on, the, second, syllable, is, becoming, more, common, in, uk, english, and, is, increasingly, considered, by, some, to, be, more, up, to, date, and, more, correct, the, oxford, online, dictionaries, claim, that, the, stress, on, the, second, syllable, is, the, most, common, pronunciation, in, the, caribbean, itself, but, according, to, the, dictionary, of, caribbean, english, usage, the, most, common, pronunciation, in, caribbean, english, stresses, the, first, syllable, instead, k, r, b, i, n, karr, ih, bee, an, the, word, caribbean, has, multiple, uses, its, principal, ones, are, geographical, and, political, the, caribbean, can, also, be, expanded, to, include, territories, with, strong, cultural, and, historical, connections, to, africa, slavery, european, colonisation, and, the, plantation, system, the, oldest, evidence, of, humans, in, the, caribbean, is, in, southern, trinidad, at, banwari, trace, where, remains, have, been, found, from, seven, thousand, years, ago, these, pre, ceramic, sites, which, belong, to, the, archaic, pre, ceramic, age, have, been, termed, ortoiroid, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, human, settlement, in, hispaniola, dates, to, about, 3600, bc, but, the, reliability, of, these, finds, is, questioned, consistent, dates, of, 3100, bc, appear, in, cuba, the, earliest, dates, in, the, lesser, antilles, are, from, 2000, bc, in, antigua, a, lack, of, pre, ceramic, sites, in, the, windward, islands, and, differences, in, technology, suggest, that, these, archaic, settlers, may, have, central, american, origins, whether, an, ortoiroid, colonization, of, the, islands, took, place, is, uncertain, but, there, is, little, evidence, of, one, dna, studies, changed, some, of, the, traditional, beliefs, about, pre, columbian, indigenous, history, according, to, national, geographic, studies, confirm, that, a, wave, of, pottery, making, farmers, known, as, ceramic, age, people, set, out, in, canoes, from, the, northeastern, coast, of, south, america, starting, some, 2, 500, years, ago, and, island, hopped, across, the, caribbean, they, were, not, however, the, first, colonizers, on, many, islands, they, encountered, a, foraging, people, who, arrived, some, 6, 000, or, 7, 000, years, ago, the, ceramicists, who, are, related, to, today, s, arawak, speaking, peoples, supplanted, the, earlier, foraging, inhabitants, presumably, through, disease, or, violence, as, they, settled, new, islands, between, 400, bc, and, 200, bc, the, first, ceramic, using, agriculturalists, the, saladoid, culture, entered, trinidad, from, south, america, they, expanded, up, the, orinoco, river, to, trinidad, and, then, spread, rapidly, up, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, some, time, after, 250, ad, another, group, the, barancoid, entered, trinidad, the, barancoid, society, collapsed, along, the, orinoco, around, 650, ad, and, another, group, the, arauquinoid, expanded, into, these, areas, and, up, the, caribbean, chain, around, 1300, ad, a, new, group, the, mayoid, entered, trinidad, and, remained, the, dominant, culture, until, spanish, settlement, at, the, time, of, the, european, discovery, of, most, of, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, three, major, amerindian, indigenous, peoples, lived, on, the, islands, the, ta, no, in, the, greater, antilles, the, bahamas, and, the, leeward, islands, the, island, caribs, and, galibi, in, the, windward, islands, and, the, ciboney, in, western, cuba, the, ta, nos, are, subdivided, into, classic, ta, nos, who, occupied, puerto, rico, and, part, of, hispaniola, western, ta, nos, who, occupied, the, bahamian, archipelago, cuba, jamaica, and, part, of, hispaniola, and, the, eastern, ta, nos, who, occupied, the, northern, lesser, antilles, the, southern, lesser, antilles, including, guadeloupe, dominica, and, trinidad, were, inhabited, by, both, carib, speaking, and, arawak, speaking, groups, soon, after, christopher, columbus, came, to, the, caribbean, both, portuguese, and, spanish, explorers, began, claiming, territories, in, central, and, south, america, these, early, colonies, brought, gold, to, europe, most, specifically, england, the, netherlands, and, france, these, nations, hoped, to, establish, profitable, colonies, in, the, caribbean, colonial, rivalries, made, the, caribbean, a, cockpit, for, european, wars, for, centuries, columbus, and, the, early, colonists, of, hispaniola, treated, the, indigenous, peoples, brutally, even, enslaving, children, in, 1512, after, pressure, from, dominican, friars, the, laws, of, burgos, were, introduced, by, the, spanish, crown, to, better, protect, the, rights, of, the, new, world, natives, the, spanish, used, a, form, of, slavery, called, the, encomienda, where, slaves, would, be, awarded, to, the, conquistadors, who, were, charged, with, protecting, and, converting, their, slaves, this, had, a, devastating, impact, on, the, population, so, starting, in, 1503, slaves, from, africa, were, imported, to, the, colony, while, early, slave, traders, were, portuguese, and, spanish, known, as, the, first, atlantic, system, by, the, 17th, century, the, trade, became, dominated, by, british, french, and, dutch, merchants, this, was, known, as, the, second, atlantic, system, 5, million, african, slaves, would, be, taken, to, the, caribbean, and, around, half, would, be, traded, to, the, british, caribbean, islands, slavery, was, abolished, first, in, the, dutch, empire, in, 1814, spain, abolished, slavery, in, its, empire, in, 1811, with, the, exceptions, of, cuba, puerto, rico, and, santo, domingo, slavery, was, not, abolished, in, cuba, until, 1886, britain, abolished, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, and, slavery, proper, in, 1833, france, abolished, slavery, in, its, colonies, in, 1848, the, caribbean, was, known, for, pirates, especially, between, 1640, and, 1680, the, term, buccaneer, is, often, used, to, describe, a, pirate, operating, in, this, region, the, caribbean, region, was, war, torn, throughout, much, of, its, colonial, history, but, the, wars, were, often, based, in, europe, with, only, minor, battles, fought, in, the, caribbean, some, wars, however, were, born, of, political, turmoil, in, the, caribbean, itself, in, 1791, a, slave, rebellion, in, the, french, colony, of, saint, domingue, led, to, the, establishment, in, 1804, of, haiti, the, first, republic, in, the, caribbean, neighboring, santo, domingo, now, dominican, republic, would, attain, its, independence, on, three, separate, occasions, in, 1821, 1844, and, 1865, cuba, became, independent, in, 1898, following, american, intervention, in, the, war, of, independence, during, the, spanish, american, war, following, the, war, spain, s, last, colony, in, the, americas, puerto, rico, became, an, unincorporated, territory, of, the, united, states, between, the, 1960s, and, 80s, most, of, the, british, holdings, in, the, caribbean, achieved, political, independence, starting, with, jamaica, in, 1962, then,

diversify, the, economies, of, the, caribbean, territories, the, tourism, industry, started, developing, in, the, early, 20th, century, rapidly, developing, in, the, 1960s, when, regular, international, flights, made, vacations, affordable, and, is, now, a, 50, billion, industry, another, industry, that, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, offshore, banking, and, financial, services, particularly, in, the, bahamas, and, the, cayman, islands, as, the, proximity, of, the, caribbean, islands, to, north, america, made, them, an, attractive, location, for, branches, of, foreign, banks, seeking, to, avail, themselves, of, less, complicated, regulations, and, lower, tax, rates, the, united, states, has, conducted, military, operations, in, the, caribbean, for, at, least, 100, years, since, the, monroe, doctrine, the, united, states, gained, a, major, influence, on, most, caribbean, nations, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, this, influence, was, extended, by, participation, in, the, banana, wars, victory, in, the, spanish, american, war, and, the, signing, of, the, platt, amendment, in, 1901, ensured, that, the, united, states, would, have, the, right, to, interfere, in, cuban, political, and, economic, affairs, militarily, if, necessary, after, the, cuban, revolution, of, 1959, relations, deteriorated, rapidly, leading, to, the, bay,

are, arid, climates, with, considerable, drought, in, some, years, and, the, peaks, of, mountains, tend, to, have, cooler, temperate, climates, rainfall, varies, with, elevation, size, and, water, currents, such, as, the, cool, upwellings, that, keep, the, abc, islands, arid, warm, moist, trade, winds, blow, consistently, from, the, east, creating, both, rain, forest, and, semi, arid, climates, across, the, region, the, tropical, rainforest, climates, include, lowland, areas, near, the, caribbean, sea, from, costa, rica, north, to, belize, as, well, as, the, dominican, republic, and, puerto,

extreme, northern, coast, of, venezuela, out, to, the, islands, including, aruba, and, curacao, as, well, as, the, northwestern, tip, of, yucat, n, while, the, region, generally, is, sunny, much, of, the, year, the, wet, season, from, may, through, november, sees, more, frequent, cloud, cover, both, broken, and, overcast, while, the, dry, season, from, december, through, april, is, more, often, clear, to, mostly, sunny, seasonal, rainfall, is, divided, into, dry, and, wet, seasons, with, the, latter, six, months, of, the, year, being, wetter, than, the, first, half, the, air, temperature,

international, s, biodiversity, hotspots, because, of, their, exceptionally, diverse, terrestrial, and, marine, ecosystems, ranging, from, montane, cloud, forests, to, tropical, rainforest, to, cactus, scrublands, the, region, also, contains, about, 8, by, surface, area, of, the, world, s, coral, reefs, along, with, extensive, seagrass, meadows, both, of, which, are, frequently, found, in, the, shallow, marine, waters, bordering, the, island, and, continental, coasts, of, the, region, for, the, fungi, there, is, a, modern, checklist, based, on, nearly, 90, 000, records, derived, from, specimens, in, reference, collections, published, accounts, and, field, observations, that, checklist, includes, more, than, 11, 250, species, of, fungi, recorded, from, the, region, as, its, authors, note, the, work, is, far, from, exhaustive, and, it, is, likely, that, the, true, total, number, of, fungal, species, already, known, from, the, caribbean, is, higher, the, true, total, number, of, fungal, species, occurring, in, the, caribbean, including, species, not, yet, recorded, is, likely, far, higher, given, the, generally, accepted, estimate, that, only, about, 7, of, all, fungi, worldwide, have, been, discovered, though, the, amount, of, available, information, is, still, small, a, first, effort, has, been, made, to, estimate, the, number, of, fungal, species, endemic, to, some, caribbean, islands, for, cuba, 2200, species, of, fungi, have, been, tentatively, identified, as, possible, endemics, of, the, island, for, puerto, rico, the, number, is, 789, species, for, the, dominican, republic, the, number, is, 699, species, for, trinidad, and, tobago, the, number, is, 407, species, many, of, the, ecosystems, of, the, caribbean, islands, have, been, devastated, by, deforestation, pollution, and, human, encroachment, the, arrival, of, the, first, humans, is, correlated, with, extinction, of, giant, owls, and, dwarf, ground, sloths, the, hotspot, contains, dozens, of, highly, threatened, animals, ranging, from, birds, to, mammals, and, reptiles, fungi, and, plants, examples, of, threatened, animals, include, the, puerto, rican, amazon, two, species, of,

700, species, of, reef, associated, fishes, have, undergone, rapid, decline, in, ecosystem, integrity, in, recent, years, and, are, considered, particularly, vulnerable, to, global, warming, and, ocean, acidification, according, to, a, unep, report, the, caribbean, coral, reefs, might, get, extinct, in, next, 20, years, due, to, population, explosion, along, the, coast, lines, overfishing, the, pollution, of, coastal, areas, and, global, warming, some, caribbean, islands, have, terrain, that, europeans, found, suitable, for, cultivation, for, agriculture, tobacco, was, an, important, early, crop, during, the, colonial, era, but, was, eventually, overtaken, by, sugarcane, production, as, the, region, s, staple, crop, sugar, was, produced, from, sugarcane, for, export, to, europe, cuba, and, barbados, were, historically, the, largest, producers, of, sugar, the, tropical, plantation, system, thus, came, to, dominate, caribbean, settlement, other, islands, were, found, to, have, terrain, unsuited, for, agriculture, for, example, dominica, which, remains, heavily, forested, the, islands, in, the, southern, lesser, antilles, aruba, bonaire, and, cura, ao, are, extremely, arid, making, them, unsuitable, for, agriculture, however, they, have, salt, pans, that, were, exploited, by, the, dutch, sea, water, was, pumped, into, shallow, ponds, producing, coarse, salt, when, the, water, evaporated, the, natural, environmental, diversity, of, the, caribbean, islands, has, led, to, recent, growth, in, eco, tourism, this, type, of, tourism, is, growing, on, islands, lacking, sandy, beaches, and, dense, human, populations, life, expectancy, in, some, countries, of, the, caribbean, in, 2022, according, to, estimation, of, the, world, bank, group, at, the, time, of, european, contact, the, dominant, ethnic, groups, in, the, caribbean, included, the, ta, no, of, the, greater, antilles, and, northern, lesser, antilles, the, island, caribs, of, the, southern, lesser, antilles, and, smaller, distinct, groups, such, as, the, guanajatabey, of, western, cuba, and, the, ciguayo, of, eastern, hispaniola, the, population, of, the, caribbean, is, estimated, to, have, been, around, 750, 000, immediately, before, european, contact, although, lower, and, higher, figures, are, given, after, contact, social, disruption, and, epidemic, diseases, such, as,

countries, arrived, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, indentured, servants, after, the, ending, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, population, increased, naturally, the, total, regional, population, was, estimated, at, 37, 5, million, by, 2000, in, haiti, and, most, of, the, french, anglophone, and, dutch, caribbean, the, population, is, predominantly, of, african, origin, on, many, islands,

europeans, indians, latinos, jews, and, arabs, this, is, a, result, of, years, of, importation, of, slaves, and, indentured, laborers, and, migration, most, multi, racial, jamaicans, refer, to,

not, enjoy, official, status, with, the, aforementioned, haitian, creole, and, papiamento, being, notable, exceptions, other, languages, such, as, caribbean, hindustani, chinese, javanese, arabic,

different, from, other, western, societies, in, terms, of, size, culture, and, degree, of, mobility, of, their, citizens, the, current, economic, and, political, problems, the, states, face, individually, are, common, to, all, caribbean, states, regional, development, has, contributed, to, attempts, to, subdue, current, problems, and, avoid, projected, problems, from, a, political, and, economic, perspective, regionalism, serves, to, make, caribbean, states, active, participants, in, current, international, affairs, through, collective, coalitions, in, 1973, the, first, political, regionalism, in, the, caribbean, basin, was, created, by, advances, of, the, english, speaking, caribbean, nations, through, the, institution, known, as, the, caribbean, common, market, and, community, caricom, which, is, located, in, guyana, certain, scholars, have, argued, both, for, and, against, generalizing, the, political, structures, of, the, caribbean, on, the, one, hand, the, caribbean, states, are, politically, diverse, ranging, from, socialist, systems, towards, more, capitalist, westminster, style, parliamentary, systems, other, scholars, argue, that, these, differences, are, superficial, and, that, they, tend, to, undermine, commonalities, in, the, various, caribbean, states, contemporary, caribbean, systems, seem, to, reflect, a, blending, of, traditional, and, modern, patterns, yielding, hybrid, systems, that, exhibit, significant, structural, variations, and, divergent, constitutional, traditions, yet, ultimately, appear, to, function, in, similar, ways, the, political, systems, of, the, caribbean, states, share, similar, practices, the, influence, of, regionalism, in, the, caribbean, is, often, marginalized, some, scholars, believe, that, regionalism, cannot, exist, in, the, caribbean, because, each, small, state, is, unique, on, the, other, hand, scholars, also, suggest, that, there, are, commonalities, amongst, the, caribbean, nations, that, suggest, regionalism, exists, proximity, as, well, as, historical, ties, among, the, caribbean, nations, has, led, to, cooperation, as, well, as, a, desire, for, collective, action, these, attempts, at, regionalization, reflect, the, nations, desires, to, compete, in, the, international, economic, system, furthermore, a, lack, of, interest, from, other, major, states, promoted, regionalism, in, the, region, in, recent, years, the, caribbean, has, suffered, from, a, lack, of, u, s, interest, with, the, end, of, the, cold, war, u, s, security, and, economic, interests, have, been, focused, on, other, areas, as, a, result, there, has, been, a, significant, reduction, in, u, s, aid, and, investment, to, the, caribbean, the, lack, of, international, support, for, these, small, relatively, poor, states, helped, regionalism, prosper, following, the, cold, war, another, issue, of, importance, in, the, caribbean, has, been, the, reduced, economic, growth, of, some, caribbean, states, due, to, the, united, states, and, european, union, s, allegations, of, special, treatment, toward, the, region, by, each, other, the, united, states, under, president, bill, clinton, launched, a, challenge, in, the, world, trade, organization, against, the, eu, over, europe, s, preferential, program, known, as, the, lom, convention, which, allowed, banana, exports, from, the, former, colonies, of, the, group, of, african, caribbean, and, pacific, states, acp, to, enter, europe, cheaply, the, world, trade, organization, sided, in, the, united, states, favour, and, the, beneficial, elements, of, the, convention, to, african, caribbean, and, pacific, states, have, been, partially, dismantled, and, replaced, by, the, cotonou, agreement, during, the, us, eu, dispute, the, united, states, imposed, large, tariffs, on, european, union, goods, up, to, 100, to, pressure, europe, to, change, the, agreement, with, the, caribbean, nations, in, favour, of, the, cotonou, agreement, farmers, in, the, caribbean, have, complained, of, falling, profits, and, rising, costs, as, the, lom, convention, weakens, some, farmers, have, faced, increased, pressure, to, turn, towards, the, cultivation, of, illegal, drugs, which, has, a, higher, profit, margin, and, fills, the, sizable, demand, for, these, illegal, drugs, in, north, america, and, europe, many, caribbean, nations, have, sought, to, deepen, ties, with, the, continent, of, africa, the, african, union, bloc, has, referred, to, the, caribbean, as, the, potential, sixth, region, of, the, african, union, some, caribbean, states, have, already, moved, to, join, africa, institutions, including, barbados, grenada, guyana, and, the, bahamas, which, have, all, became, members, of, the, african, export, import, bank, and, the, caribbean, development, bank, signing, a, cooperation, strategic, partnership, agreement, with, the, african, development, bank, afdb, at, present, antigua, and, barbuda, barbados, jamaica, guyana, and, suriname, are, at, various, stages, of, establishing, direct, air, flights, with, africa, to, boost, person, to, person, links, and, boost, trade, between, both, regions, the, first, inter, regional, africa, caribbean, community, caricom, summit, took, place, in, september, 2021, in, august, 2023, the, african, union, s, african, export, import, bank, officially, opened, its, first, caribbean, community, office, in, barbados, beginning, the, process, of, integrating, willing, caribbean, states, as, the, 6th, region, of, the, african, union, caribbean, nations, have, also, started, to, more, closely, cooperate, in, the, caribbean, financial, action, task, force, and, other, instruments, to, add, oversight, of, the, offshore, industry, one, of, the, most, important, associations, that, deal, with, regionalism, amongst, the, nations, of, the, caribbean, basin, has, been, the, association, of, caribbean, states, acs, proposed, by, caricom, in, 1992, the, acs, soon, won, the, support, of, the, other, countries, of, the, region, it, was, founded, in, july, 1994, the, acs, maintains, regionalism, within, the, caribbean, on, issues, unique, to, the, caribbean, basin, through, coalition, building, like, the, acs, and, caricom, regionalism, has, become, an, undeniable, part, of, the, politics, and, economics, of, the, caribbean, the, successes, of, region, building, initiatives, are, still, debated, by, scholars, yet, regionalism, remains, prevalent, throughout, the, caribbean, the, president, of, venezuela, hugo, chavez, launched, an, economic, group, called, the, bolivarian, alliance, for, the, americas, alba, which, several, eastern, caribbean, islands, joined, here, are, some, of, the, bodies, that, several, islands, share, in, collaboration, geography, these, three, form, the, sss, islands, that, with, the, abc, islands, comprise, the, dutch, caribbean, of, which, the, bes, islands, are, not,
