portuguese, language, countries, the, islands, making, up, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, were, formed, around, approximately, 30, million, years, ago, due, to, volcanic, activity, in, deep, water, along, the, cameroon, line, over, time, interactions, with, seawater, and, periods, of, eruption, have, engendered, a, wide, variety, of, different, igneous, and, volcanic, rocks, on, the, islands, with, complex, assemblages, of, minerals, the, islands, of, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, were, uninhabited, when, the, portuguese, arrived, sometime, around, 1470, the, first, europeans, to, put, ashore, were, jo, o, de, santar, m, and, p, ro, escobar, portuguese, navigators, explored, the, islands, and, decided, that, they, would, be, good, locations, for, bases, to, trade, with, the, mainland, the, dates, of, european, arrival, are, sometimes, given, as, 21, december, st, thomas, s, day, 1471, for, s, o, tom, and, 17, january, st, antony, s, day, 1472, for, pr, ncipe, though, other, sources, cite, different, years, around, that, time, pr, ncipe, was, initially, named, santo, ant, o, saint, anthony, changing, its, name, in, 1502, to, ilha, do, pr, ncipe, prince, s, island, in, reference, to, the, prince, of, portugal, to, whom, duties, on, the, island, s, sugar, crop, were, paid, the, first, successful, settlement, of, s, o, tom, was, established, in, 1493, by, lvaro, caminha, who, received, the, land, as, a, grant, from, the, crown, pr, ncipe, was, settled, in, 1500, under, a, similar, arrangement, attracting, settlers, proved, difficult, however, and, most, of, the, earliest, inhabitants, were, undesirables, sent, from, portugal, mostly, sephardic, jews, 2, 000, jewish, children, eight, years, old, and, under, were, taken, from, the, iberian, peninsula, for, work, on, the, sugar, plantations, in, time, these, settlers, found, the, volcanic, soil, of, the, region, suitable, for, agriculture, especially, the, growing, of, sugar, by, 1515, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, had, become, slave, depots, for, the, coastal, slave, trade, centered, at, elmina, the, cultivation, of, sugar, was, a, labour, intensive, process, and, the, portuguese, began, to, enslave, large, numbers, of, africans, from, the, continent, in, the, sugar, boom, s, early, stages, property, on, the, islands, had, little, value, with, farming, for, local, consumption, while, the, economy, relied, mainly, on, the, transit, of, slaves, though, already, many, foodstuffs, were, imported, when, the, local, landowner, lvaro, borges, died, in, 1504, his, cleared, land, and, domesticated, animals, were, sold, for, only, 13, 000, r, is, about, the, price, of, three, slaves, according, to, valentim, fernandes, around, 1506, s, o, tom, had, more, sugarcane, fields, than, madeira, from, which, they, already, produce, molasses, but, the, island, lacked, facilities, for, industrial, sugar, production, s, o, tom, would, only, become, economically, noteworthy, with, the, introduction, of, a, water, powered, sugar, mill, in, 1515, which, soon, led, to, the, mass, cultivation, of, sugar, the, fields, are, expanding, and, the, sugar, mills, too, at, this, time, only, two, sugar, mills, are, here, and, another, three, are, being, built, counting, the, mill, of, the, contractors, which, is, large, similarly, the, necessary, conditions, exist, such, as, streams, and, timber, to, be, able, to, build, many, more, and, the, canes, are, the, biggest, i, have, ever, seen, in, my, life, sugar, plantations, were, organized, with, slave, labor, and, by, the, mid, 16th, century, the, portuguese, settlers, had, turned, the, islands, into, africa, s, foremost, exporter, of, sugar, slaves, in, s, o, tom, were, brought, from, the, slave, coast, of, west, africa, the, niger, delta, the, island, of, fernando, po, and, later, from, the, kongo, and, angola, in, the, 16th, century, the, enslaved, were, imported, from, and, exported, to, portugal, elmina, the, kingdom, of, kongo, angola, and, the, spanish, americas, in, 1510, reportedly, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, slaves, were, imported, by, portugal, in, 1516, s, o, tom, received, 4, 072, slaves, with, the, purpose, of, re, exportation, from, 1519, to, 1540, the, island, was, the, center, of, the, slave, trade, between, elmina, and, the, niger, delta, throughout, the, early, to, mid, sixteenth, century, s, o, tom, traded, in, slaves, intermittently, with, angola, and, the, kingdom, of, kongo, in, 1525, s, o, tom, began, trafficking, slaves, to, the, spanish, americas, mainly, to, the, caribbean, and, brazil, from, 1532, to, 1536, s, o, tom, sent, an, annual, average, of, 342, slaves, to, the, antilles, prior, to, 1580, the, island, accounted, for, 75, percent, of, brazil, s, imports, mainly, slaves, the, slave, trade, remained, a, cornerstone, of, s, o, tom, s, economy, until, after, 1600, the, power, dynamics, of, s, o, tom, in, the, 16th, century, were, surprisingly, diverse, with, the, participation, of, free, mulatto, and, black, citizens, in, governance, voluntary, colonists, shunned, s, o, tom, for, its, disease, and, food, shortages, so, the, portuguese, crown, deported, convicts, to, the, island, and, encouraged, interracial, relationships, to, secure, the, colony, slavery, was, also, not, permanent, as, demonstrated, through, the, 1515, royal, decree, granting, the, manumission, of, african, wives, of, white, settlers, and, their, mixed, race, children, in, 1517, another, decree, freed, the, male, slaves, who, had, originally, arrived, on, the, island, with, the, first, colonists, after, 1520, a, royal, charter, allowed, for, property, owning, married, free, mulattos, to, hold, public, offices, this, was, followed, by, a, decree, in, 1546, establishing, civil, equality, between, these, qualified, mulattos, and, the, white, settlers, allowing, free, mulattos, and, black, citizens, opportunities, for, upward, mobility, and, participation, in, local, politics, and, business, social, divisions, led, to, frequent, disputes, within, the, colony, s, town, councils, and, with, the, governor, and, bishop, with, constant, political, instability, at, first, slavery, in, s, o, tom, was, less, strict, in, the, mid, 16th, century, an, anonymous, portuguese, pilot, noted, that, the, slaves, were, employed, as, couples, built, their, own, accommodations, and, worked, autonomously, once, a, week, on, the, cultivation, of, their, own, food, supply, however, this, more, relaxed, slave, system, did, not, last, long, following, the, introduction, of, plantations, throughout, slaves, frequently, ran, away, to, the, inhospitable, mountain, forests, of, the, island, s, interior, between, 1514, and, 1527, five, percent, of, slaves, that, were, imported, to, s, o, tom, escaped, often, to, starve, though, 1531, 1535, saw, major, food, shortages, even, in, the, plantations, eventually, the, maroon, people, developed, settlements, in, the, interior, known, as, macambos, the, first, signs, of, slave, rebellion, began, in, the, 1530s, when, the, maroon, gangs, organized, to, attack, plantations, some, of, which, were, abandoned, a, formal, complaint, was, lodged, by, local, portuguese, authorities, in, 1531, lamenting, that, too, many, settlers, and, black, citizens, were, being, killed, in, the, attacks, and, that, the, island, would, be, lost, if, the, problem, remained, unresolved, in, a, 1533, bush, war, a, bush, captain, led, militia, units, to, suppress, the, maroons, a, significant, event, in, the, maroon, fight, for, freedom, occurred, in, 1549, when, two, men, claiming, to, be, free, born, were, taken, in, from, the, macambos, by, a, wealthy, mulatto, planter, named, ana, de, chaves, with, the, support, of, de, chaves, the, two, men, petitioned, the, king, to, be, declared, free, and, the, request, was, approved, the, largest, population, of, maroons, coincided, with, the, sugar, boom, of, the, mid, 16th, century, as, the, plantations, teemed, with, slaves, between, 1587, and, 1590, many, of, the, runaway, slaves, were, defeated, in, another, bush, war, by, 1593, the, governor, declared, the, maroon, forces, almost, completely, extinguished, nevertheless, maroon, populations, kept, settlers, away, from, the, southern, and, western, regions, the, greatest, slave, revolt, occurred, in, july, 1595, when, the, government, was, weakened, by, disputes, between, the, bishop, and, the, governor, a, native, slave, named, amador, recruited, 5, 000, slaves, to, raid, and, destroy, plantations, sugar, mills, and, settler, houses, amador, s, rebellion, made, three, raids, on, the, town, and, destroyed, 60, of, the, island, s, 85, sugar, mills, but, they, were, defeated, by, the, militia, after, three, weeks, two, hundred, slaves, were, killed, in, combat, and, amador, and, the, other, rebel, leaders, were, executed, while, the, rest, of, the, slaves, were, granted, amnesty, and, returned, to, their, plantation, smaller, slave, rebellions, followed, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, eventually, competition, from, sugar, producing, colonies, in, the, western, hemisphere, began, to, hurt, the, islands, the, large, enslaved, population, also, proved, difficult, to, control, with, portugal, unable, to, invest, many, resources, in, the, effort, sugar, cultivation, thus, declined, over, the, next, 100, years, and, by, the, mid, 17th, century, s, o, tom, had, become, primarily, a, transit, point, for, ships, engaged, in, the, slave, trade, between, continental, africa, and, the, americas, in, the, early, 19th, century, two, new, cash, crops, coffee, and, cocoa, were, introduced, by, 1908, s, o, tom, had, become, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, cocoa, which, remains, the, country, s, most, important, crop, the, ro, as, system, which, gave, the, plantation, managers, a, high, degree, of, authority, led, to, abuses, against, the, african, farm, workers, although, portugal, officially, abolished, slavery, in, 1876, the, practice, of, forced, paid, labour, continued, scientific, american, documented, in, words, and, pictures, the, continued, use, of, slaves, in, s, o, tom, in, its, 13, march, 1897, issue, observations, of, the, solar, eclipse, of, 29, may, 1919, in, pr, ncipe, by, sir, arthur, eddington, provided, one, of, the, first, successful, tests, of, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, in, the, early, 20th, century, an, internationally, publicized, controversy, arose, over, charges, that, angolan, contract, workers, were, being, subjected, to, forced, labour, and, unsatisfactory, working, conditions, sporadic, labor, unrest, and, dissatisfaction, continued, well, into, the, 20th, century, culminating, in, an, outbreak, of, riots, in, 1953, in, which, several, hundred, african, laborers, were, killed, in, a, clash, with, their, portuguese, rulers, the, anniversary, of, this, batep, massacre, remains, officially, observed, by, the, government, by, the, late, 1950s, when, other, emerging, nations, across, the, african, continent, demanded, their, independence, a, small, group, of, s, o, tom, ans, formed, the,
