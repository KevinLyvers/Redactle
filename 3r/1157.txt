the, inner, city, by, the, housing, commission, of, victoria, which, resulted, in, the, demolition, of, many, neighbourhoods, and, a, proliferation, of, high, rise, towers, in, later, years, with,

more, new, jobs, were, created, in, melbourne, than, any, other, australian, city, almost, as, many, as, the, next, two, fastest, growing, cities, brisbane, and, perth, combined, and, melbourne, s, property, market, remained, highly, priced, resulting, in, historically, high, property, prices, and, widespread, rent, increases, beginning, in, the, 2010s, the, state, government, of, victoria, initiated, a, number, of, major, infrastructure, projects, designed, to, reduce, congestion, in, melbourne, and, encourage, economic, growth, including, the, metro, tunnel, the, west, gate, tunnel,

affected, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, spent, a, long, time, under, lockdown, restrictions, with, melbourne, experiencing, six, lockdowns, totalling, 262, days, while, this, contributed, to, a, net, outflow, of, migration, causing, a, slight, reduction, in, melbourne, s, population, over, the, course, of, 2020, to, 2022, melbourne, is, projected, to, be, the, fastest, growing, capital, city,

with, warm, summers, and, cool, winters, melbourne, is, well, known, for, its, changeable, weather, conditions, mainly, due, to, it, being, located, on, the, boundary, of, hot, inland, areas, and, the, cool, southern, ocean, this, temperature, differential, is, most, pronounced, in, the, spring, and, summer, months, and, can, cause, strong, cold, fronts, to, form, these, cold, fronts, can, be,

victorian, standards, are, nonetheless, drizzly, and, overcast, the, lack, of, winter, rainfall, is, owed, to, melbourne, s, rain, shadowed, location, between, the, otway, and, macedon, ranges, which, block, much, of, the, rainfall, arriving, from, the, north, and, west, port, phillip, is, often, warmer, than, the, surrounding, oceans, and, or, the, land, mass, particularly, in, spring, and,
