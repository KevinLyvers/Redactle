the, tibetan, plateau, also, known, as, qinghai, tibet, plateau, and, qing, zang, plateau, is, a, vast, elevated, plateau, located, at, the, intersection, of, central, south, and, east, asia, covering, most, of, the, tibet, autonomous, region, most, of, qinghai, western, half, of, sichuan, southern, gansu, provinces, in, western, china, southern, xinjiang, bhutan, the, indian, regions, of, ladakh, and, lahaul, and, spiti, himachal, pradesh, as, well, as, gilgit, baltistan, in, pakistan, northwestern, nepal, eastern, tajikistan, and, southern, kyrgyzstan, it, stretches, approximately, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, north, to, south, and, 2, 500, kilometres, 1, 600, mi, east, to, west, it, is, the, world, s, highest, and, largest, plateau, above, sea, level, with, an, area, of, 2, 500, 000, square, kilometres, 970, 000, sq, mi, with, an, average, elevation, exceeding, 4, 500, metres, 14, 800, ft, and, being, surrounded, by, imposing, mountain, ranges, that, harbor, the, world, s, two, highest, summits, mount, everest, and, k2, the, tibetan, plateau, is, often, referred, to, as, the, roof, of, the, world, the, tibetan, plateau, contains, the, headwaters, of, the, drainage, basins, of, most, of, the, streams, and, rivers, in, surrounding, regions, this, includes, the, three, longest, rivers, in, asia, the, yellow, yangtze, and, mekong, its, tens, of, thousands, of, glaciers, and, other, geographical, and, ecological, features, serve, as, a, water, tower, storing, water, and, maintaining, flow, it, is, sometimes, termed, the, third, pole, because, its, ice, fields, contain, the, largest, reserve, of, fresh, water, outside, the, polar, regions, the, impact, of, climate, change, on, the, tibetan, plateau, is, of, ongoing, scientific, interest, the, tibetan, plateau, is, surrounded, by, the, massive, mountain, ranges, of, high, mountain, asia, the, plateau, is, bordered, to, the, south, by, the, inner, himalayan, range, to, the, north, by, the, kunlun, mountains, which, separate, it, from, the, tarim, basin, and, to, the, northeast, by, the, qilian, mountains, which, separate, the, plateau, from, the, hexi, corridor, and, gobi, desert, to, the, east, and, southeast, the, plateau, gives, way, to, the, forested, gorge, and, ridge, geography, of, the, mountainous, headwaters, of, the, salween, mekong, and, yangtze, rivers, in, northwest, yunnan, and, western, sichuan, the, hengduan, mountains, in, the, west, the, curve, of, the, rugged, karakoram, range, of, northern, kashmir, embraces, the, plateau, the, indus, river, originates, in, the, western, tibetan, plateau, in, the, vicinity, of, lake, manasarovar, the, tibetan, plateau, is, bounded, in, the, north, by, a, broad, escarpment, where, the, altitude, drops, from, around, 5, 000, metres, 16, 000, ft, to, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, over, a, horizontal, distance, of, less, than, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, along, the, escarpment, is, a, range, of, mountains, in, the, west, the, kunlun, mountains, separate, the, plateau, from, the, tarim, basin, about, halfway, across, the, tarim, the, bounding, range, becomes, the, altyn, tagh, and, the, kunluns, by, convention, continue, somewhat, to, the, south, in, the, v, formed, by, this, split, is, the, western, part, of, the, qaidam, basin, the, altyn, tagh, ends, near, the, dangjin, pass, on, the, dunhuang, golmud, road, to, the, west, are, short, ranges, called, the, danghe, yema, shule, and, tulai, nanshans, the, easternmost, range, is, the, qilian, mountains, the, line, of, mountains, continues, east, of, the, plateau, as, the, qinling, which, separates, the, ordos, plateau, from, sichuan, north, of, the, mountains, runs, the, gansu, or, hexi, corridor, which, was, the, main, silk, road, route, from, china, proper, to, the, west, the, plateau, is, a, high, altitude, arid, steppe, interspersed, with, mountain, ranges, and, large, brackish, lakes, annual, precipitation, ranges, from, 100, to, 300, millimetres, 3, 9, to, 11, 8, in, and, falls, mainly, as, hail, the, southern, and, eastern, edges, of, the, steppe, have, grasslands, that, can, sustainably, support, populations, of, nomadic, herdsmen, although, frost, occurs, for, six, months, of, the, year, permafrost, occurs, over, extensive, parts, of, the, plateau, proceeding, to, the, north, and, northwest, the, plateau, becomes, progressively, higher, colder, and, drier, until, reaching, the, remote, changtang, region, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, plateau, here, the, average, altitude, exceeds, 5, 000, metres, 16, 000, ft, and, winter, temperatures, can, drop, to, 40, c, 40, f, as, a, result, of, this, extremely, inhospitable, environment, the, changtang, region, together, with, the, adjoining, kekexili, region, is, the, least, populous, region, in, asia, and, the, third, least, populous, area, in, the, world, after, antarctica, and, northern, greenland, the, geological, history, of, the, tibetan, plateau, is, closely, related, to, that, of, the, himalayas, the, himalayas, belong, to, the, alpine, orogeny, and, are, therefore, among, the, younger, mountain, ranges, on, the, planet, consisting, mostly, of, uplifted, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rock, their, formation, is, a, result, of, a, continental, collision, or, orogeny, along, the, convergent, boundary, between, the, indo, australian, plate, and, the, eurasian, plate, the, collision, began, in, the, upper, cretaceous, period, about, 70, million, years, ago, when, the, north, moving, indo, australian, plate, moving, at, about, 15, cm, 6, in, per, year, collided, with, the, eurasian, plate, about, 50, million, years, ago, this, fast, moving, indo, australian, plate, had, completely, closed, the, tethys, ocean, the, existence, of, which, has, been, determined, by, sedimentary, rocks, settled, on, the, ocean, floor, and, the, volcanoes, that, fringed, its, edges, since, these, sediments, were, light, they, crumpled, into, mountain, ranges, rather, than, sinking, to, the, floor, during, this, early, stage, of, its, formation, in, the, late, palaeogene, tibet, consisted, of, a, deep, palaeovalley, bounded, by, multiple, mountain, ranges, rather, than, the, more, topographically, uniform, elevated, flatland, that, it, is, today, the, tibetan, plateau, s, mean, elevation, continued, to, vary, since, its, initial, uplift, in, the, eocene, isotopic, records, show, the, plateau, s, altitude, was, around, 3, 000, metres, above, sea, level, around, the, oligocene, miocene, boundary, and, that, it, fell, by, 900, metres, between, 25, 5, and, 21, 6, million, years, ago, attributable, to, tectonic, unroofing, from, east, west, extension, or, to, erosion, from, climatic, weathering, the, plateau, subsequently, rose, by, 500, to, 1, 000, metres, between, 21, 6, and, 20, 4, million, years, ago, palaeobotanical, evidence, indicates, that, the, nujiang, suture, zone, and, the, yarlung, zangpo, suture, zone, remained, tropical, or, subtropical, lowlands, until, the, latest, oligocene, or, early, miocene, enabling, biotic, interchange, across, tibet, the, age, of, east, west, grabens, in, the, lhasa, and, himalaya, terranes, suggests, that, the, plateau, s, elevation, was, close, to, its, modern, altitude, by, around, 14, to, 8, million, years, ago, erosion, rates, in, tibet, decreased, significantly, around, 10, million, years, ago, the, indo, australian, plate, continues, to, be, driven, horizontally, below, the, tibetan, plateau, which, forces, the, plateau, to, move, upwards, the, plateau, is, still, rising, at, a, rate, of, approximately, 5, mm, 0, 2, in, per, year, although, erosion, reduces, the, actual, increase, in, height, much, of, the, tibetan, plateau, is, of, relatively, low, relief, the, cause, of, this, is, debated, among, geologists, some, argue, that, the, tibetan, plateau, is, an, uplifted, peneplain, formed, at, low, altitude, while, others, argue, that, the, low, relief, stems, from, erosion, and, infill, of, topographic, depressions, that, occurred, at, already, high, elevations, the, current, tectonics, of, the, plateau, are, also, debated, the, best, regarded, explanations, are, provided, by, the, block, model, and, the, alternative, continuum, model, according, to, the, former, the, crust, of, the, plateau, is, formed, of, several, blocks, with, little, internal, deformation, separated, by, major, strike, slip, faults, in, the, latter, the, plateau, is, affected, by, distributed, deformation, resulting, from, flow, within, the, crust, the, tibetan, plateau, supports, a, variety, of, ecosystems, most, of, them, classified, as, montane, grasslands, while, parts, of, the, plateau, feature, an, alpine, tundra, like, environment, other, areas, feature, monsoon, influenced, shrublands, and, forests, species, diversity, is, generally, reduced, on, the, plateau, due, to, the, elevation, and, low, precipitation, the, tibetan, plateau, hosts, the, tibetan, wolf, and, species, of, snow, leopard, wild, yak, wild, ass, cranes, vultures, hawks, geese, snakes, and, water, buffalo, one, notable, animal, is, the, high, altitude, jumping, spider, that, can, live, at, elevations, of, over, 6, 500, metres, 21, 300, ft, ecoregions, found, on, the, tibetan, plateau, as, defined, by, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, are, as, follows, extinct, humans, denisovans, lived, on, the, tibetan, plateau, from, around, 200, 000, to, 40, 000, years, ago, this, is, according, to, a, study, published, in, nature, nomads, on, the, tibetan, plateau, and, in, the, himalayas, are, the, remainders, of, nomadic, practices, historically, once, widespread, in, asia, and, africa, pastoral, nomads, constitute, about, 40, of, the, ethnic, tibetan, population, the, presence, of, nomadic, peoples, on, the, plateau, is, predicated, on, their, adaptation, to, survival, on, the, world, s, grassland, by, raising, livestock, rather, than, crops, which, are, unsuitable, to, the, terrain, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, earliest, human, occupation, of, the, plateau, occurred, between, 30, 000, and, 40, 000, years, ago, since, colonization, of, the, tibetan, plateau, tibetan, culture, has, adapted, and, flourished, in, the, western, southern, and, eastern, regions, of, the, plateau, the, northern, portion, the, changtang, is, generally, too, high, and, cold, to, support, permanent, population, one, of, the, most, notable, civilizations, to, have, developed, on, the, tibetan, plateau, is, the, tibetan, empire, from, the, 7th, century, to, the, 9th, century, ad, monsoons, are, caused, by, the, different, amplitudes, of, surface, temperature, seasonal, cycles, between, land, and, oceans, this, differential, warming, occurs, because, heating, rates, differ, between, land, and, water, ocean, heating, is, distributed, vertically, through, a, mixed, layer, that, may, be, 50, meters, deep, through, the, action, of, wind, and, buoyancy, generated, turbulence, whereas, the, land, surface, conducts, heat, slowly, with, the, seasonal, signal, penetrating, only, a, meter, or, so, additionally, the, specific, heat, capacity, of, liquid, water, is, significantly, greater, than, that, of, most, materials, that, make, up, land, together, these, factors, mean, that, the, heat, capacity, of, the, layer, participating, in, the, seasonal, cycle, is, much, larger, over, the, oceans, than, over, land, with, the, consequence, that, the, land, warms, and, cools, faster, than, the, ocean, in, turn, air, over, the, land, warms, faster, and, reaches, a, higher, temperature, than, does, air, over, the, ocean, the, warmer, air, over, land, tends, to, rise, creating, an, area, of, low, pressure, the, pressure, anomaly, then, causes, a, steady, wind, to, blow, toward, the, land, which, brings, the, moist, air, over, the, ocean, surface, with, it, rainfall, is, then, increased, by, the, presence, of, the, moist, ocean, air, the, rainfall, is, stimulated, by, a, variety, of, mechanisms, such, as, low, level, air, being, lifted, upwards, by, mountains, surface, heating, convergence, at, the, surface, divergence, aloft, or, from, storm, produced, outflows, near, the, surface, when, such, lifting, occurs, the, air, cools, due, to, expansion, in, lower, pressure, which, in, turn, produces, condensation, and, precipitation, in, winter, the, land, cools, off, quickly, but, the, ocean, maintains, the, heat, longer, the, hot, air, over, the, ocean, rises, creating, a, low, pressure, area, and, a, breeze, from, land, to, ocean, while, a, large, area, of, drying, high, pressure, is, formed, over, the, land, increased, by, wintertime, cooling, monsoons, are, similar, to, sea, and, land, breezes, a, term, usually, referring, to, the, localized, diurnal, cycle, of, circulation, near, coastlines, everywhere, but, they, are, much, larger, in, scale, stronger, and, seasonal, the, seasonal, monsoon, wind, shift, and, weather, associated, with, the, heating, and, cooling, of, the, tibetan, plateau, is, the, strongest, such, monsoon, on, earth, today, tibet, is, an, important, heating, surface, of, the, atmosphere, however, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, an, approximately, 2, 400, 000, square, kilometres, 930, 000, sq, mi, ice, sheet, covered, the, plateau, due, to, its, great, extent, this, glaciation, in, the, subtropics, was, an, important, element, of, radiative, forcing, with, a, much, lower, latitude, the, ice, in, tibet, reflected, at, least, four, times, more, radiation, energy, per, unit, area, into, space, than, ice, at, higher, latitudes, thus, while, the, modern, plateau, heats, the, overlying, atmosphere, during, the, last, ice, age, it, helped, to, cool, it, this, cooling, had, multiple, effects, on, regional, climate, without, the, thermal, low, pressure, caused, by, the, heating, there, was, no, monsoon, over, the, indian, subcontinent, this, lack, of, monsoon, caused, extensive, rainfall, over, the, sahara, expansion, of, the, thar, desert, more, dust, deposited, into, the, arabian, sea, and, a, lowering, of, the, biotic, life, zones, on, the, indian, subcontinent, animals, responded, to, this, shift, in, climate, with, the, javan, rusa, migrating, into, india, in, addition, the, glaciers, in, tibet, created, meltwater, lakes, in, the, qaidam, basin, the, tarim, basin, and, the, gobi, desert, despite, the, strong, evaporation, caused, by, the, low, latitude, silt, and, clay, from, the, glaciers, accumulated, in, these, lakes, when, the, lakes, dried, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, the, silt, and, clay, were, blown, by, the, downslope, wind, off, the, plateau, these, airborne, fine, grains, produced, the, enormous, amount, of, loess, in, the, chinese, lowlands, ice, of, the, plateau, provides, a, valuable, window, to, the, past, in, 2015, researchers, studying, the, plateau, reached, the, top, of, the, guliya, glacier, with, ice, thickness, of, 310, m, 1, 020, ft, and, drilled, to, a, depth, of, 50, m, 160, ft, in, order, to, recover, ice, core, samples, due, to, the, extremely, low, biomass, in, those, 15, 000, year, old, samples, it, had, taken, around, 5, years, of, research, to, extract, 33, viruses, of, which, 28, were, new, to, science, none, had, survived, the, extraction, process, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, those, viruses, infected, plants, or, other, microorganisms, the, tibetan, plateau, contains, the, world, s, third, largest, store, of, ice, qin, dahe, the, former, head, of, the, china, meteorological, administration, issued, the, following, assessment, in, 2009, temperatures, are, rising, four, times, faster, than, elsewhere, in, china, and, the, tibetan, glaciers, are, retreating, at, a, higher, speed, than, in, any, other, part, of, the, world, in, the, short, term, this, will, cause, lakes, to, expand, and, bring, floods, and, mudflows, in, the, long, run, the, glaciers, are, vital, lifelines, for, asian, rivers, including, the, indus, and, the, ganges, once, they, vanish, water, supplies, in, those, regions, will, be, in, peril, the, tibetan, plateau, contains, the, largest, area, of, low, latitude, glaciers, and, is, particularly, vulnerable, to, global, warming, over, the, past, five, decades, 80, of, the, glaciers, in, the, tibetan, plateau, have, retreated, losing, 4, 5, of, their, combined, areal, coverage, this, region, is, also, liable, to, suffer, damages, from, permafrost, thaw, caused, by, climate, change
