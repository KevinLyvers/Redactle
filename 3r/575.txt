additional, resources, to, siccfin, also, in, 2000, a, report, by, french, politicians, arnaud, montebourg, and, vincent, peillon, stated, that, monaco, had, relaxed, policies, with, respect, to, money, laundering, including, within, its, casino, and, that, the, government, of, monaco, had, been, placing, political, pressure, on, the, judiciary, so, that, alleged, crimes, were, not, being,

early, as, 2001, like, belgium, finland, france, the, netherlands, and, spain, monaco, decided, to, put, the, minting, date, on, its, coins, this, is, why, the, first, euro, coins, from, monaco, have, the, year, 2001, on, them, instead, of, 2002, like, the, other, countries, of, the, eurozone, that, decided, to, put, the, year, of, first, circulation, 2002, on, their, coins, three, different,
