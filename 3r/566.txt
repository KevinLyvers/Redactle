slavs, speeding, up, the, development, of, the, slavs, of, carantania, and, of, carniola, into, an, independent, carantanian, carniolans, slovene, ethnic, group, by, the, high, middle, ages, the, historic, provinces, of, carniola, styria, carinthia, gorizia, trieste, and, istria, developed, from, the, border, regions, and, were, incorporated, into, the, medieval, holy, roman, empire, the, consolidation, and, formation, of, these, historical, lands, took, place, in, a, long, period, between, the, 11th, and, 14th, centuries, and, were, led, by, a, number, of, important, feudal, families, such, as, the, dukes, of, spanheim, the, counts, of, gorizia, the, counts, of, celje, and, finally, the, house, of, habsburg, in, a, parallel, process, an, intensive, germanization, significantly, diminished, the, extent, of, slovene, speaking, areas, by, the, 15th, century, the, slovene, ethnic, territory, was, reduced, to, its, present, size, in, 1335, henry, of, gorizia, duke, of, carinthia,

of, the, territory, of, present, day, slovenia, became, a, hereditary, land, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, as, with, the, other, component, parts, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, carinthia, and, carniola, remained, a, semi, autonomous, state, with, its, own, constitutional, structure, for, a, long, time, the, counts, of, celje, a, feudal, family, from, this, area, who, in, 1436, acquired, the, title, of, state, princes, were, habsburgs, powerful, competitors, for, some, time, this, large, dynasty, important, at, a, european, political, level, had, its, seat, in, slovene, territory, but, died, out, in, 1456, its, numerous, large, estates, subsequently, became, the, property, of, the, habsburgs, who, retained, control, of, the, area, right, up, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century,

austrian, littoral, as, well, as, prekmurje, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, industrialization, was, accompanied, by, construction, of, railroads, to, link, cities, and, markets, but, the, urbanization, was, limited, due, to, limited, opportunities, between, 1880, and, 1910, there, was, extensive, emigration, around, 300, 000, slovenes, 1, in, 6, emigrated, to, other, countries, mostly, to, the, us, but, also, to, south, america, the, main, part, to, argentina, germany, egypt, and, to, larger, cities, in, austria, hungary, especially, vienna, and, graz, despite, this, emigration, the, population, of, slovenia, increased, significantly, literacy, was, exceptionally, high, at, 80, 90, the, 19th, century, also, saw, a, revival, of, culture, in, slovene, accompanied, by, a, romantic, nationalist, quest, for, cultural, and, political, autonomy, the, idea, of, a, united, slovenia, first, advanced, during, the, revolutions, of, 1848, became, the, common, platform, of, most, slovenian, parties, and, political, movements, in, austria, hungary, during, the, same, period, yugoslavism, an, ideology, stressing, the, unity, of, all, south, slavic, peoples, spread, as, a, reaction, to, pan, german, nationalism, and, italian, irredentism, world, war, i, brought, heavy, casualties, to, slovenes, particularly, the, twelve, battles, of, the, isonzo, which, took, place, in, present, day, slovenia, s, western, border, area, with, italy, hundreds, of, thousands, of, slovene, conscripts, were, drafted, into, the, austro, hungarian, army, and, over, 30, 000, of, them, died, hundreds, of, thousands, of, slovenes, from, princely, county, of, gorizia, and, gradisca, were, resettled, in, refugee, camps, in, italy, and, austria, while, the, refugees, in, austria, received,

the, fascists, took, power, in, italy, they, were, subjected, to, a, policy, of, violent, fascist, italianization, this, caused, the, mass, emigration, of, slovenes, especially, the, middle, class, from, the, slovene, littoral, and, trieste, to, yugoslavia, and, south, america, those, who, remained, organized, several, connected, networks, of, both, passive, and, armed, resistance, the, best,

slovene, parties, and, a, mass, mobilization, of, slovene, civil, society, known, as, the, declaration, movement, followed, this, demand, was, rejected, by, the, austrian, political, elites, but, following, the, dissolution, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, the, national, council, of, slovenes, croats, and, serbs, took, power, in, zagreb, on,

very, windy, because, it, lies, in, the, slipstream, of, the, alps, the, average, wind, speeds, are, lower, than, in, the, plains, of, the, nearby, countries, due, to, the, rugged, terrain, local, vertical, winds, with, daily, periods, are, present, besides, these, there, are, three, winds, of, particular, regional, importance, the, bora, the, jugo, and, the, foehn, the, jugo, and, the, bora,
