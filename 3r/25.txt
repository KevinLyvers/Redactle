the, geoid, d, i, d, jee, oyd, is, the, shape, that, the, ocean, surface, would, take, under, the, influence, of, the, gravity, of, earth, including, gravitational, attraction, and, earth, s, rotation, if, other, influences, such, as, winds, and, tides, were, absent, this, surface, is, extended, through, the, continents, such, as, might, be, approximated, with, very, narrow, hypothetical, canals, according, to, gauss, who, first, described, it, it, is, the, mathematical, figure, of, the, earth, a, smooth, but, irregular, surface, whose, shape, results, from, the, uneven, distribution, of, mass, within, and, on, the, surface, of, earth, it, can, be, known, only, through, extensive, gravitational, measurements, and, calculations, despite, being, an, important, concept, for, almost, 200, years, in, the, history, of, geodesy, and, geophysics, it, has, been, defined, to, high, precision, only, since, advances, in, satellite, geodesy, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, geoid, is, often, expressed, as, a, geoid, undulation, or, geoidal, height, above, a, given, reference, ellipsoid, which, is, a, slightly, flattened, sphere, whose, equatorial, bulge, is, caused, by, the, planet, s, rotation, generally, the, geoidal, height, rises, where, the, earth, s, material, is, locally, more, dense, and, exerts, greater, gravitational, force, than, the, surrounding, areas, the, geoid, in, turn, serves, as, a, reference, coordinate, surface, for, various, vertical, coordinates, such, as, orthometric, heights, geopotential, heights, and, dynamic, heights, see, geodesy, heights, all, points, on, a, geoid, surface, have, the, same, geopotential, the, sum, of, gravitational, potential, energy, and, centrifugal, potential, energy, at, this, surface, apart, from, temporary, tidal, fluctuations, the, force, of, gravity, acts, everywhere, perpendicular, to, the, geoid, meaning, that, plumb, lines, point, perpendicular, and, bubble, levels, are, parallel, to, the, geoid, being, an, equigeopotential, means, the, geoid, corresponds, to, the, free, surface, of, water, at, rest, if, only, the, earth, s, gravity, and, rotational, acceleration, were, at, work, this, is, also, a, sufficient, condition, for, a, ball, to, remain, at, rest, instead, of, rolling, over, the, geoid, earth, s, gravity, acceleration, the, vertical, derivative, of, geopotential, is, thus, non, uniform, over, the, geoid, the, geoid, surface, is, irregular, unlike, the, reference, ellipsoid, which, is, a, mathematical, idealized, representation, of, the, physical, earth, as, an, ellipsoid, but, is, considerably, smoother, than, earth, s, physical, surface, although, the, ground, of, the, earth, has, excursions, on, the, order, of, 8, 800, m, mount, everest, and, 11, 000, m, marianas, trench, the, geoid, s, deviation, from, an, ellipsoid, ranges, from, 85, m, iceland, to, 106, m, southern, india, less, than, 200, m, total, if, the, ocean, were, of, constant, density, and, undisturbed, by, tides, currents, or, weather, its, surface, would, resemble, the, geoid, the, permanent, deviation, between, the, geoid, and, mean, sea, level, is, called, ocean, surface, topography, if, the, continental, land, masses, were, crisscrossed, by, a, series, of, tunnels, or, canals, the, sea, level, in, those, canals, would, also, very, nearly, coincide, with, the, geoid, geodesists, are, able, to, derive, the, heights, of, continental, points, above, the, geoid, by, spirit, leveling, being, an, equipotential, surface, the, geoid, is, by, definition, a, surface, upon, which, the, force, of, gravity, is, perpendicular, everywhere, apart, from, temporary, tidal, fluctuations, this, means, that, when, traveling, by, ship, one, does, not, notice, the, undulation, of, the, geoid, neglecting, tides, the, local, vertical, plumb, line, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, geoid, and, the, local, horizon, tangential, to, it, likewise, spirit, levels, will, always, be, parallel, to, the, geoid, earth, s, gravitational, field, is, not, uniform, an, oblate, spheroid, is, typically, used, as, the, idealized, earth, but, even, if, the, earth, were, spherical, and, did, not, rotate, the, strength, of, gravity, would, not, be, the, same, everywhere, because, density, varies, throughout, the, planet, this, is, due, to, magma, distributions, the, density, and, weight, of, different, geological, compositions, in, the, earth, s, crust, mountain, ranges, deep, sea, trenches, crust, compaction, due, to, glaciers, and, so, on, if, that, sphere, were, then, covered, in, water, the, water, would, not, be, the, same, height, everywhere, instead, the, water, level, would, be, higher, or, lower, with, respect, to, earth, s, center, depending, on, the, integral, of, the, strength, of, gravity, from, the, center, of, the, earth, to, that, location, the, geoid, level, coincides, with, where, the, water, would, be, generally, the, geoid, rises, where, the, earth, s, material, is, locally, more, dense, exerts, greater, gravitational, force, and, pulls, more, water, from, the, surrounding, area, the, geoid, undulation, also, known, as, geoid, height, or, geoid, anomaly, n, is, the, height, of, the, geoid, relative, to, a, given, ellipsoid, of, reference, n, h, h, displaystyle, n, h, h, the, undulation, is, not, standardized, as, different, countries, use, different, mean, sea, levels, as, reference, but, most, commonly, refers, to, the, egm96, geoid, in, maps, and, common, use, the, height, over, the, mean, sea, level, such, as, orthometric, height, h, is, used, to, indicate, the, height, of, elevations, while, the, ellipsoidal, height, h, results, from, the, gps, system, and, similar, gnss, h, h, n, displaystyle, h, h, n, an, analogous, relationship, exists, between, normal, heights, and, the, quasigeoid, which, disregards, local, density, variations, in, practice, many, handheld, gps, receivers, interpolate, n, in, a, pre, computed, geoid, map, a, lookup, table, so, a, gps, receiver, on, a, ship, may, during, the, course, of, a, long, voyage, indicate, height, variations, even, though, the, ship, will, always, be, at, sea, level, neglecting, the, effects, of, tides, that, is, because, gps, satellites, orbiting, about, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, earth, can, measure, heights, only, relative, to, a, geocentric, reference, ellipsoid, to, obtain, one, s, orthometric, height, a, raw, gps, reading, must, be, corrected, conversely, height, determined, by, spirit, leveling, from, a, tide, gauge, as, in, traditional, land, surveying, is, closer, to, orthometric, height, modern, gps, receivers, have, a, grid, implemented, in, their, software, by, which, they, obtain, from, the, current, position, the, height, of, the, geoid, e, g, the, egm96, geoid, over, the, world, geodetic, system, wgs, ellipsoid, they, are, then, able, to, correct, the, height, above, the, wgs, ellipsoid, to, the, height, above, the, egm96, geoid, when, height, is, not, zero, on, a, ship, the, discrepancy, is, due, to, other, factors, such, as, ocean, tides, atmospheric, pressure, meteorological, effects, local, sea, surface, topography, and, measurement, uncertainties, the, undulation, of, the, geoid, n, is, closely, related, to, the, disturbing, potential, t, according, to, bruns, formula, named, after, heinrich, bruns, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, force, of, normal, gravity, computed, from, the, normal, field, potential, u, displaystyle, u, another, way, of, determining, n, is, using, values, of, gravity, anomaly, g, displaystyle, delta, g, differences, between, true, and, normal, reference, gravity, as, per, stokes, formula, or, stokes, integral, published, in, 1849, by, george, gabriel, stokes, the, integral, kernel, s, called, stokes, function, was, derived, by, stokes, in, closed, analytical, form, note, that, determining, n, displaystyle, n, anywhere, on, earth, by, this, formula, requires, g, displaystyle, delta, g, to, be, known, everywhere, on, earth, including, oceans, polar, areas, and, deserts, for, terrestrial, gravimetric, measurements, this, is, a, near, impossibility, in, spite, of, close, international, co, operation, within, the, international, association, of, geodesy, iag, e, g, through, the, international, gravity, bureau, bgi, bureau, gravim, trique, international, another, approach, for, geoid, determination, is, to, combine, multiple, information, sources, not, just, terrestrial, gravimetry, but, also, satellite, geodetic, data, on, the, figure, of, the, earth, from, analysis, of, satellite, orbital, perturbations, and, lately, from, satellite, gravity, missions, such, as, goce, and, grace, in, such, combination, solutions, the, low, resolution, part, of, the, geoid, solution, is, provided, by, the, satellite, data, while, a, tuned, version, of, the, above, stokes, equation, is, used, to, calculate, the, high, resolution, part, from, terrestrial, gravimetric, data, from, a, neighbourhood, of, the, evaluation, point, only, calculating, the, undulation, is, mathematically, challenging, the, precise, geoid, solution, by, petr, van, ek, and, co, workers, improved, on, the, stokesian, approach, to, geoid, computation, their, solution, enables, millimetre, to, centimetre, accuracy, in, geoid, computation, an, order, of, magnitude, improvement, from, previous, classical, solutions, geoid, undulations, display, uncertainties, which, can, be, estimated, by, using, several, methods, e, g, least, squares, collocation, lsc, fuzzy, logic, artificial, neural, networks, radial, basis, functions, rbf, and, geostatistical, techniques, geostatistical, approach, has, been, defined, as, the, most, improved, technique, in, prediction, of, geoid, undulation, variations, in, the, height, of, the, geoidal, surface, are, related, to, anomalous, density, distributions, within, the, earth, geoid, measures, thus, help, understanding, the, internal, structure, of, the, planet, synthetic, calculations, show, that, the, geoidal, signature, of, a, thickened, crust, for, example, in, orogenic, belts, produced, by, continental, collision, is, positive, opposite, to, what, should, be, expected, if, the, thickening, affects, the, entire, lithosphere, mantle, convection, also, changes, the, shape, of, the, geoid, over, time, the, surface, of, the, geoid, is, higher, than, the, reference, ellipsoid, wherever, there, is, a, positive, gravity, anomaly, or, negative, disturbing, potential, mass, excess, and, lower, than, the, reference, ellipsoid, wherever, there, is, a, negative, gravity, anomaly, or, positive, disturbing, potential, mass, deficit, this, relationship, can, be, understood, by, recalling, that, gravity, potential, is, defined, so, that, it, has, negative, values, and, is, inversely, proportional, to, distance, from, the, body, so, while, a, mass, excess, will, strengthen, the, gravity, acceleration, it, will, decrease, the, gravity, potential, as, a, consequence, the, geoid, s, defining, equipotential, surface, will, be, found, displaced, away, from, the, mass, excess, analogously, a, mass, deficit, will, weaken, the, gravity, pull, but, will, increase, the, geopotential, at, a, given, distance, causing, the, geoid, to, move, towards, the, mass, deficit, the, presence, of, a, localized, inclusion, in, the, background, medium, will, rotate, the, gravity, acceleration, vectors, slightly, towards, or, away, from, a, denser, or, lighter, body, respectively, causing, a, bump, or, dimple, in, the, equipotential, surface, the, largest, absolute, deviation, can, be, found, in, the, indian, ocean, geoid, low, 106, meters, below, the, average, sea, level, another, large, feature, is, the, north, atlantic, geoid, high, or, north, atlantic, geoid, swell, caused, in, part, by, the, weight, of, ice, cover, over, north, america, and, northern, europe, in, the, late, cenozoic, ice, age, recent, satellite, missions, such, as, the, gravity, field, and, steady, state, ocean, circulation, explorer, goce, and, grace, have, enabled, the, study, of, time, variable, geoid, signals, the, first, products, based, on, goce, satellite, data, became, available, online, in, june, 2010, through, the, european, space, agency, esa, launched, the, satellite, in, march, 2009, on, a, mission, to, map, earth, s, gravity, with, unprecedented, accuracy, and, spatial, resolution, on, 31, march, 2011, a, new, geoid, model, was, unveiled, at, the, fourth, international, goce, user, workshop, hosted, at, the, technical, university, of, munich, germany, studies, using, the, time, variable, geoid, computed, from, grace, data, have, provided, information, on, global, hydrologic, cycles, mass, balances, of, ice, sheets, and, postglacial, rebound, from, postglacial, rebound, measurements, time, variable, grace, data, can, be, used, to, deduce, the, viscosity, of, earth, s, mantle, spherical, harmonics, are, often, used, to, approximate, the, shape, of, the, geoid, the, current, best, such, set, of, spherical, harmonic, coefficients, is, egm2020, earth, gravitational, model, 2020, determined, in, an, international, collaborative, project, led, by, the, national, imagery, and, mapping, agency, now, the, national, geospatial, intelligence, agency, or, nga, the, mathematical,

coefficients, c, n, m, displaystyle, overline, c, nm, and, s, n, m, displaystyle, overline, s, nm, can, be, determined, by, first, observing, in, the, equation, for, v, displaystyle, v, that, for, a, specific, value, of, n, displaystyle, n, there, are, two, coefficients, for, every, value, of, m, displaystyle, m, except, for, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, there, is, only, one, coefficient, when, m, 0,
