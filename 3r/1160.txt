nicholson, later, renamed, wellington, was, seen, as, a, better, choice, for, an, administrative, capital, because, of, its, proximity, to, the, south, island, and, wellington, became, the, capital, in, 1865, after, losing, its, status, as, capital, auckland, remained, the, principal, city, of, the, auckland, province, until, the, provincial, system, was, abolished, in, 1876, in, response, to, the, ongoing, rebellion, by, h, ne, heke, in, the, mid, 1840s, the, government, encouraged, retired, but, fit, british, soldiers, and, their, families, to, migrate, to, auckland, to, form, a, defence, line, around, the, port, settlement, as, garrison, soldiers, by, the, time, the, first, fencibles, arrived, in, 1848, the, northern, war, had, concluded, outlying, defensive, towns, were, then, constructed, to, the, south, stretching, in, a, line, from, the, port, village, of, onehunga, in, the, west, to, howick, in, the, east, each, of, the, four, settlements, had, about, 800, settlers, the, men, were, fully, armed, in, case, of, emergency, but, spent, nearly, all, their, time, breaking, in, the, land, and, establishing, roads, in, the, early, 1860s, auckland, became, a, base, against, the, m, ori, king, movement, and, the, 12, 000, imperial, soldiers, stationed, there, led, to, a, strong, boost, to, local, commerce, this, and, continued, road, building, towards, the, south, into, the, waikato, region, enabled, p, keh, european, new, zealanders, influence, to, spread, from, auckland, the, city, s, population, grew, fairly, rapidly, from, 1, 500, in, 1841, to, 3, 635, in, 1845, then, to, 12, 423, by, 1864, the, growth, occurred, similarly, to, other, mercantile, dominated, cities, mainly, around, the, port, and, with, problems, of, overcrowding, and, pollution, auckland, s, population, of, ex, soldiers, was, far, greater, than, that, of, other, settlements, about, 50, per, cent, of, the, population, was, irish, which, contrasted, heavily, with, the, majority, english, settlers, in, wellington, christchurch, or, new, plymouth, the, majority, of, settlers, in, the, early, period, were, assisted, by, receiving, cheap, passage, to, new, zealand, trams, and, railway, lines, shaped, auckland, s, rapid, expansion, in, the, early, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, however, after, the, second, world, war, the, city, s, transport, system, and, urban, form, became, increasingly, dominated, by, the, motor, vehicle, arterial, roads, and, motorways, became, both, defining, and, geographically, dividing, features, of, the, urban, landscape, they, also, allowed, further, massive, expansion, that, resulted, in, the, growth, of, suburban, areas, such, as, the, north, shore, especially, after, the, construction, of, the, auckland, harbour, bridge, in, the, late, 1950s, and, manukau, city, in, the, south, economic, deregulation, in, the, mid, 1980s, led, to, very, dramatic, changes, to, auckland, s, economy, and, many, companies, relocated, their, head, offices, from, wellington, to, auckland, the, region, was, now, the, nerve, centre, of, the, entire, national, economy, auckland, also, benefited, from, a, surge, in, tourism, which, brought, 75, per, cent, of, new, zealand, s, international, visitors, through, its, airport, auckland, s, port, handled, 31, per, cent, of, the, country, s, container, trade, in, 2015, the, face, of, urban, auckland, changed, when, the, government, s, immigration, policy, began, allowing, immigrants, from, asia, in, 1986, this, has, led, to, auckland, becoming, a, multicultural, city,

especially, in, areas, close, to, the, waitemat, harbour, traditionally, the, most, common, residence, of, aucklanders, was, a, standalone, dwelling, on, a, quarter, acre, 1, 000, m, 2, however, subdividing, such, properties, with, infill, housing, has, long, been, the, norm, auckland, s, housing, stock, has, become, more, diverse, in, recent, decades, with, many, more, apartments, being, built, since, the, 1970s, particularly, since, the, 1990s, in, the, cbd, nevertheless, the, majority, of, aucklanders, live, in, single, dwelling, housing, and, are, expected, to, continue, to, do,

buyers, who, had, incomes, on, par, with, the, national, average, in, a, new, subdivision, at, hobsonville, point, 20, percent, of, new, homes, were, reduced, to, below, 550, 000, some, of, the, demand, for, new, housing, at, this, time, was, attributed, to, the, 43, 000, people, who, moved, into, auckland, between, june, 2014, and, june, 2015, research, has, found, that, auckland, is, set, to, become, even, more, densely, populated, in, future, which, could, ease, the, burden, by, creating, higher, density, housing, in, the, city, centre, from, around, november, 2021, to, may, 2022,
