square, kilometres, 10, sq, mi, the, first, inhabitants, of, tuvalu, were, polynesians, arriving, as, part, of, the, migration, of, polynesians, into, the, pacific, that, began, about, three, thousand, years, ago, long, before, european, contact, with, the, pacific, islands, polynesians, frequently, voyaged, by, canoe, between, the, islands, polynesian, navigation, skills, enabled, them, to, make, elaborately, planned, journeys, in, either, double, hulled, sailing, canoes, or, outrigger, canoes, scholars, believe, that, the, polynesians, spread, out, from, samoa, and, tonga, into, the, tuvaluan, atolls, which, then, served, as, a, stepping, stone, for, further, migration, into, the, polynesian, outliers, in, melanesia, and, micronesia, in, 1569, spanish, explorer, and, cartographer, lvaro, de, menda, a, became, the, first, european, known, to, sail, through, the, archipelago, sighting, the, island, of, nui, during, an, expedition, he, was, making, in, search, of,

the, late, 19th, century, great, britain, claimed, control, over, the, ellice, islands, designating, them, as, within, their, sphere, of, influence, between, 9, and, 16, october, 1892, captain, herbert, gibson, of, hms, curacoa, declared, each, of, the, ellice, islands, a, british, protectorate, britain, assigned, a, resident, commissioner, to, administer, the, ellice, islands, as, part, of, the, british, western, pacific, territories, bwpt, from, 1916, to, 1975, they, were, managed, as, part, of, the, gilbert, and, ellice, islands, colony, a, referendum, was, held, in, 1974, to,

on, 1, october, 1975, on, 1, january, 1976, the, old, administration, was, officially, separated, and, two, separate, british, colonies, kiribati, and, tuvalu, were, formed, on, 1, october, 1978,

tuvalu, became, the, 189th, member, of, the, united, nations, the, islands, do, not, have, a, significant, amount, of, soil, so, the, country, relies, heavily, on, imports, and, fishing, for, food, licensing, fishing, permits, to, international, companies, grants, and, aid, projects, and, remittances, to, their, families, from, tuvaluan, seafarers, who, work, on, cargo, ships, are, important, parts, of, the, economy, because, it, is, a, low, lying, island, nation, the, country, is, extremely, vulnerable, to, sea, level, rise, due, to, climate, change, it, is, active, in, international, climate, negotiations, as, part, of, the, alliance, of, small, island, states, the, origins, of, the, people, of, tuvalu, are, addressed, in, the, theories, regarding, the, migration, into, the, pacific, that, began, about, 3, 000, years, ago, during, pre, european, contact, times, there, was, frequent, canoe, voyaging, between, the, nearer, islands, including, samoa, and, tonga, eight, of, the, nine, islands, of, tuvalu, were, inhabited, this, explains, the, origin, of, the, name, tuvalu, which, means, eight, standing, together, in, tuvaluan, compare, to, walo, meaning, eight, in, proto, austronesian, possible, evidence, of, human, made, fires, in, the, caves, of, nanumanga, suggests, humans, may, have, occupied, the, islands, for, thousands, of, years, an, important, creation, myth, in, the, islands, of, tuvalu, is, the, story, of, te, pusi, mo, te, ali, the, eel, and, the, flounder, who, are, said, to, have, created, the, islands, of, tuvalu, te, ali, the, flounder, is, believed, to, be, the, origin, of, the, flat, atolls, of, tuvalu, and, te, pusi, the, eel, is, the, model, for, the, coconut, palms, that, are, important, in, the, lives, of, tuvaluans, the, stories, of, the, ancestors, of, the, tuvaluans, vary, from, island, to, island, on, niutao, funafuti, and, vaitupu, the, founding, ancestor, is, described, as, being, from, samoa, whereas, on, nanumea, the,

as, the, island, that, mourelle, also, sailed, past, on, 5, may, 1781, thus, solving, what, europeans, had, called, the, mystery, of, gran, cocal, mourelle, s, map, and, journal, named, the, island, el, gran, cocal, the, great, coconut, plantation, however, the, latitude, and, longitude, was, uncertain, longitude, could, be, reckoned, only, crudely, at, the, time, as, accurate, chronometers, did, not, become, available, until, the, late, 18th, century, in, 1809, captain, patterson, in, the, brig, elizabeth, sighted, nanumea, while, passing, through, the, northern, tuvalu, waters, on, a,

estimated, that, a, sea, level, rise, of, 20, 40, centimetres, 7, 9, 15, 7, inches, in, the, next, 100, years, could, make, tuvalu, uninhabitable, a, study, published, in, 2018, estimated, the, change, in, land, area, of, tuvalu, s, nine, atolls, and, 101, reef, islands, between, 1971, and, 2014, indicating, that, 75, of, the, islands, had, grown, in, area, with, an, overall, increase, of, more, than, 2, enele, sopoaga, the, prime, minister, of, tuvalu, at, the, time, responded, to, the, research, by, stating, that, tuvalu, is, not, expanding, and, has, gained, no, additional, habitable, land, sopoaga, has, also, said, that, evacuating, the, islands, is, the, last, resort, whether, there, are, measurable, changes, in, the, sea, level, relative, to, the, islands, of, tuvalu, is, a, contentious, issue, there, were, problems, associated, with, the, pre, 1993, sea, level, records, from, funafuti, which, resulted, in, improvements, in, the, recording, technology, to, provide, more, reliable, data, for, analysis, the, degree, of, uncertainty, as, to, estimates, of, sea, level, change, relative, to, the, islands, of, tuvalu, was, reflected, in, the, conclusions, made, in, 2002, from, the, available, data, the, uncertainty, as, to, the, accuracy, of, the, data, from, this, tide, gauge, resulted, in, a, modern, aquatrak, acoustic, gauge, being, installed, in, 1993, by, the, australian, national, tidal, facility, ntf, as, part, of, the, ausaid, sponsored, south, pacific, sea, level, and, climate, monitoring, project, the, 2011, report, of, the, pacific, climate, change, science, program, published, by, the, australian, government, concludes, the, sea, level, rise, near, tuvalu, measured, by, satellite, altimeters, since, 1993, is, about, 5, mm, 0, 2, in, per, year, tuvalu, has, adopted, a, national, plan, of, action, as, the, observable, transformations, over, the, last, ten, to, fifteen, years, show, tuvaluans, that, there, have, been, changes, to, the, sea, levels, these, include, sea, water, bubbling, up, through, the, porous, coral, rock, to, form, pools, at, high, tide, and, the, flooding, of, low, lying, areas, including, the, airport, during, spring, tides, and, king, tides, in, november, 2022, simon, kofe, minister, for, justice, communication, foreign, affairs, proclaimed, that, in, response, to, rising, sea, levels, and, the, perceived, failures, by, the, outside, world, to, combat, global, warming, the, country, would, be, uploading, a, virtual, version, of, itself, to, the, metaverse, in, an, effort, to, preserve, its, history, and, culture, the, major, concerns, about, climate, change, has, led, to, the, launching, and, development, of, the, national, adaptation, programme, of, action, napa, these, adaptation, measures, are, needed, to, decrease, the, amount, and, volume, of, the, negative, effects, from, climate, change, napa, has, selected, seven, adaptation, projects, with, all, different, themes, these, are, coastal, agricultural, water, health, fisheries, two, different, projects, and, disaster, for, example, a, target, of, one, of, these, projects, like, the, project, coastal, is, increasing, resilience, of, coastal, areas, and, settlement, to, climate, change, and, for, the, project, water, it, is, adaptation, to, frequent, water, shortages, through, increasing, household, water, capacity, water, collection, accessories, and, water, conservation, techniques, the, tuvalu, coastal, adaptation, project, tcap, was, launched, in, 2017, for, the, purpose, on, enhancing, the, resilience, of, the, islands, of, tuvalu, to, meet, the, challenges, resulting, from, higher, sea, levels, tuvalu, was, the, first, country, in, the, pacific, to, access, climate, finance, from, green, climate, fund, with, the, support, of, the, undp, in, december, 2022, work, on, the, funafuti, reclamation, project, commenced, the, project, is, to, dredge, sand, from, the, lagoon, to, construct, a, platform, on, funafuti, that, is, 780, metres, 2, 560, ft, meters, long, and, 100, metres, 330, ft, meters, wide, giving, a, total, area, of, approximately, 7, 8, ha, 19, 27, acres,

provided, funding, for, the, tcap, further, projects, that, are, part, of, tcap, are, capital, works, on, the, outer, islands, of, nanumea, and, nanumaga, aimed, at, reducing, exposure, to, coastal, damage, resulting, from, storms, because, of, the, low, elevation, the, islands, that, make, up, this, country, are, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, tropical, cyclones, and, by, the, threat, of, current, and, future, sea, level, rise, a, warning, system, which, uses, the, iridium, satellite, network, was, introduced, in, 2016, to, allow, outlying, islands, to, be, better, prepared, for, natural, disasters, the, highest, elevation, is, 4, 6, metres, 15, ft, above, sea, level, on, niulakita, tuvalu, thus, has, the, second, lowest, maximum, elevation, of, any, country, after, the, maldives, the, highest, elevations, are, typically, in, narrow, storm, dunes, on, the, ocean, side, of, the, islands, which, are, prone, to, overtopping, in, tropical, cyclones, as, occurred, with, cyclone, bebe, which, was, a, very, early, season, storm, that, passed, through, the, tuvaluan, atolls, in, october, 1972, cyclone, bebe, submerged, funafuti, eliminating, 95, of, structures, on, the, island, with, 6, people, lost, in, the, cyclone, sources, of, drinking, water, were, contaminated, as, a, result, of, the, system, s, storm, surge, and, the, flooding, of, the, sources, of, fresh,
