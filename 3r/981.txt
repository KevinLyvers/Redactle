people, the, city, was, largely, destroyed, at, the, hands, of, the, mongol, empire, in, 1258, resulting, in, a, decline, that, would, linger, through, many, centuries, due, to, frequent, plagues, and, multiple, successive, empires, with, the, recognition, of, iraq, as, an, independent, state, formerly, the, british, mandate, of, mesopotamia, in, 1932, baghdad, gradually, regained, some, of, its, former, prominence, as, a, significant, center, of, arab, culture, with, a, population, variously, estimated, at, 6, or, over, 7, million, compared, to, its, large, population, it, has, a, small,

resulting, in, a, substantial, loss, of, cultural, heritage, and, historical, artifacts, during, this, period, baghdad, had, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, terrorist, attacks, in, the, world, however, terrorist, attacks, have, gradually, been, on, the, decline, since, the, territorial, defeat, of, the, islamic, state, militant, group, in, iraq, in, 2017, and, are, very, rare, now, as, capital, of, iraq, baghdad, is, home, to, government, offices, and, diplomatic, missions, it, is, home, to, numerous, landmarks, popular, as, tourist, spots, such, mosques, churches, synagogues, malls, and, hotels, the, city, serves, as, an, important, gateway, hub, to, iraq, through, the, baghdad, international, airport, ethnically, baghdad, is, a, diverse, city, with, arabic, speaking, sunni, muslims, as, a, majority, while, assyrians, armenians, and, jews, are, a, minority, making, the, city, cosmopolitan, the, name, baghdad, is, pre, islamic, and, its, origin, is, disputed, the, site, where, the, city, of, baghdad, developed, has, been, populated, for, millennia, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, site, of, baghdad, was, occupied, by, various, peoples, long, before, the, arab, conquest, of, mesopotamia, in, 637, ce, and, several, ancient, empires, had, capitals, located, in, the, surrounding, area, arab, authors, realizing, the, pre, islamic, origins, of, baghdad, s, name, generally, looked, for, its, roots, in, middle, persian, they, suggested, various, meanings, the, most, common, of, which, was, bestowed, by, god, modern, scholars, generally, tend, to, favor, this, etymology, which, views, the, word, as, a, persian, compound, of, bagh, god, and, d, d, given, in, old, persian, the, first, element, can, be, traced, to, boghu, and, is, related, to, indo, iranian, bhag, and, slavic, bog, god, a, similar, term, in, middle, persian, is, the, name, mithrad, t, mehrdad, in, new, persian, known, in, english, by, its, borrowed, hellenistic, form, mithridates, meaning, given, by, mithra, d, t, is, the, more, archaic, form, of, d, d, related, to, sanskrit, d, t, latin, dat, and, english, donor, ultimately, borrowed, from, persian, mehrdad, there, are, a, number, of, other, locations, whose, names, are, compounds, of, the, middle, persian, word, bagh, including, baghlan, and, bagram, in, afghanistan, baghshan, in, iran, itself, and, baghdati, in, georgia, which, likely, share, the, same, etymological, iranic, origins, other, authors, have, suggested, older, origins, for, the, name, in, particular, the, name, bagdadu, or, hudadu, that, existed, in, old, babylonian, spelled, with, a, sign, that, can, represent, both, bag, and, hu, and, the, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, name, of, a, place, called, baghdatha, some, scholars, suggested, aramaic, derivations, another, view, suggested, by, christophe, wall, romana, is, that, name, of, baghdad, is, derived, from, akkad, as, the, cuneiform, logogram, for, akkad, is, pronounced, a, ga, d, ki, agade, and, its, resemblance, to, baghdad, is, compelling, when, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, founded, a, completely, new, city, for, his, capital, he, chose, the, name, city, of, peace, arabic, romanized, mad, nat, as, sal, m, which, now, refers, to, the, round, city, of, baghdad, proper, this, was, the, official, name, on, coins, weights, and, other, official, usage, although, the, common, people, continued, to, use, the, old, name, by, the, 11th, century, baghdad, became, almost, the, exclusive, name, for, the, world, renowned, metropolis, christophe, wall, romana, has, suggested, that, al, mansur, s, choice, to, found, his, new, city, at, baghdad, because, of, its, strategic, location, was, the, same, criteria, which, influenced, sargon, s, choice, to, found, the, original, city, of, akkad, in, the, exact, same, location, after, the, fall, of, the, umayyads, the, first, muslim, dynasty, the, victorious, abbasid, rulers, wanted, their, own, capital, from, which, they, could, rule, they, chose, a, site, north, of, the, sassanid, capital, of, ctesiphon, and, on, 30, july, 762, the, caliph, al, mansur, commissioned, the, construction, of, the, city, it, was, built, under, the, guidance, of, the, iranian, barmakids, mansur, believed, that, baghdad, was, the, perfect, city, to, be, the, capital, of, the, islamic, empire, under, the, abbasids, the, muslim, historian, al, tabari, reported, an, ancient, prediction, by, christian, monks, that, a, lord, named, miklas, would, one, day, build, a, spectacular, city, around, the, area, of, baghdad, when, al, mansur, heard, the, story, he, became, very, joyful, for, legend, has, it, he, was, called, miklas, as, a, child, mansur, loved, the, site, so, much, he, is, quoted, saying, this, is, indeed, the, city, that, i, am, to, found, where, i, am, to, live, and, where, my, descendants, will, reign, afterward, the, city, s, growth, was, helped, by, its, excellent, location, based, on, at, least, two, factors, it, had, control, over, strategic, and, trading, routes, along, the, tigris, and, it, had, an, abundance, of, water, in, a, dry, climate, water, exists, on, both, the, north, and, south, ends, of, the, city, allowing, all, households, to, have, a, plentiful, supply, which, was, quite, uncommon, during, this, time, the, city, of, baghdad, quickly, became, so, large, that, it, had, to, be, divided, into, three, judicial, districts, madinat, al, mansur, the, round, city, al, sharqiyya, al, karkh, and, askar, al, mahdi, on, the, west, bank, al, mansur, also, planned, out, al, karkh, district, so, that, he, could, separate, the, markets, from, the, round, city, in, order, to, keep, the, turbulent, populace, away, from, the, round, city, to, ensure, that, the, gates, would, not, be, open, at, night, for, markets, over, time, the, markets, became, diverse, and, a, home, to, merchants, and, craftsmen, officials, with, the, title, of, muhtasib, were, hired, to, look, after, markets, to, prevent, cheating, and, check, the, weighs, and, measures, of, stocks, baghdad, eclipsed, ctesiphon, the, capital, of, the, sassanians, which, was, located, some, 30, km, 19, mi, to, the, southeast, today, all, that, remains, of, ctesiphon, is, the, shrine, town, of, salman, pak, just, to, the, south, of, greater, baghdad, which, is, where, salman, the, persian, is, believed, to, have, been, buried, ctesiphon, itself, had, replaced, and, absorbed, seleucia, the, first, capital, of, the, seleucid, empire, which, had, earlier, replaced, the, city, of, babylon, according, to, the, traveler, ibn, battuta, baghdad, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, not, including, the, damage, it, has, received, the, residents, are, mostly, hanbalis, baghdad, is, also, home, to, the, grave, of, abu, hanifa, where, there, is, a, cell, and, a, mosque, above, it, the, sultan, of, baghdad, abu, said, bahadur, khan, was, a, tatar, king, who, embraced, islam, in, its, early, years, the, city, was, known, as, a, deliberate, reminder, of, an, expression, in, the, qur, an, when, it, refers, to, paradise, it, took, four, years, to, build, 764, 768, mansur, assembled, engineers, surveyors, and, art, constructionists, from, around, the, world, to, come, together, and, draw, up, plans, for, the, city, over, 100, 000, construction, workers, came, to, survey, the, plans, many, were, distributed, salaries, to, start, the, building, of, the, city, july, was, chosen, as, the, starting, time, because, two, astrologers, naubakht, ahvazi, an, iranian, zoroastrian, and, mashallah, an, iranian, jew, believed, that, the, city, should, be, built, under, the, sign, of, the, lion, leo, leo, is, associated, with, fire, and, symbolizes, productivity, pride, and, expansion, and, leo, s, connection, symbolically, to, mithra, the, bricks, used, to, make, the, city, were, 18, in, 460, mm, on, all, four, sides, abu, hanifah, was, the, counter, of, the, bricks, and, he, developed, a, canal, which, brought, water, to, the, work, site, for, both, human, consumption, and, the, manufacture, of, the, bricks, marble, was, also, used, to, make, buildings, throughout, the, city, and, marble, steps, led, down, to, the, river, s, edge, the, basic, framework, of, the, city, consists, of, two, large, semicircles, about, 19, km, 12, mi, in, diameter, the, inner, city, connecting, them, was, designed, as, a, circle, about, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, in, diameter, leading, it, to, be, known, as, the, round, city, the, original, design, shows, a, single, ring, of, residential, and, commercial, structures, along, the, inside, of, the, city, walls, but, the, final, construction, added, another, ring, inside, the, first, within, the, city, there, were, many, parks, gardens, villas, and, promenades, there, was, a, large, sanitation, department, many, fountains, and, public, baths, and, unlike, contemporary, european, cities, at, the, time, streets, were, frequently, washed, free, of, debris, and, trash, in, fact, by, the, time, of, harun, al, rashid, baghdad, had, a, few, thousand, hammams, these, baths, increased, public, hygiene, and, served, as, a, way, for, the, religious, to, perform, ablutions, as, prescribed, by, islam, moreover, entry, fees, were, usually, so, low, that, almost, everyone, could, afford, them, in, the, center, of, the, city, lay, the, mosque, as, well, as, headquarters, for, guards, the, purpose, or, use, of, the, remaining, space, in, the, center, is, unknown, the, circular, design, of, the, city, was, a, direct, reflection, of, the, traditional, persian, sasanian, urban, design, the, sasanian, city, of, gur, in, fars, built, 500, years, before, baghdad, is, nearly, identical, in, its, general, circular, design, radiating, avenues, and, the, government, buildings, and, temples, at, the, center, of, the, city, this, style, of, urban, planning, contrasted, with, ancient, greek, and, roman, urban, planning, in, which, cities, are, designed, as, squares, or, rectangles, with, streets, intersecting, each, other, at, right, angles, baghdad, was, a, hectic, city, during, the, day, and, had, many,

such, as, those, later, told, in, arabian, nights, storytelling, became, a, profession, called, al, qaskhun, which, survived, until, the, modern, era, the, four, surrounding, walls, of, baghdad, were, named, kufa, basra, khurasan, and, syria, named, because, their, gates, pointed, in, the, directions, of, these, destinations, the, distance, between, these, gates, was, a, little, less, than, 2, 4, km, 1, 5, mi, each, gate, had, double, doors, that, were, made, of, iron, the, doors, were, so, heavy, it, took, several, men, to, open, and, close, them, the, wall, itself, was, about, 44, m, thick, at, the, base, and, about, 12, m, thick, at, the, top, also, the, wall, was, 30, m, high, which, included, merlons, a, solid, part, of, an, embattled, parapet, usually, pierced, by, embrasures, this, wall, was, surrounded, by, another, wall, with, a, thickness, of, 50, m, the, second, wall, had, towers, and, rounded, merlons, which, surrounded, the, towers, this, outer, wall, was, protected, by, a, solid, glacis, which, is, made, out, of, bricks, and, quicklime, beyond, the, outer, wall, was, a, water, filled, moat, the, golden, gate, palace, the, residence, of, the, caliph, and, his, family, was, in, the, heart, of, baghdad, in, the, central, square, in, the, central, part, of, the, building, there, was, a, green, dome, that, was, 39m, high, surrounding, the, palace, was, an, esplanade, a, waterside, building, in, which, only, the, caliph, could, come, riding, on, horseback, in, addition, the, palace, was, near, other, mansions, and, officer, s, residences, near, the, gate, of, syria, a, building, served, as, the, home, for, the, guards, it, was, made, of, brick, and, marble, the, palace, governor, lived, in, the, latter, part, of, the, building, and, the, commander, of, the, guards, in, the, front, in, 813, after, the, death, of, caliph, al, amin, the, palace, was, no, longer, used, as, the, home, for, the, caliph, and, his, family, the, roundness, points, to, the, fact, that, it, was, based, on, arabic, script, the, two, designers, who, were, hired, by, al, mansur, to, plan, the, city, s, design, were, naubakht, a, zoroastrian, who, also, determined, that, the, date, of, the, foundation, of, the, city, would, be, astrologically, auspicious, and, mashallah, a, jew, from, khorasan, iran, within, a, generation, of, its, founding, baghdad, became, a, hub, of,

persians, syriacs, nestorians, jews, arab, christians, and, people, from, other, ethnic, and, religious, groups, native, to, the, region, these, are, considered, among, the, fundamental, elements, that, contributed, to, the, flourishing, of, scholarship, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, baghdad, was, also, a, significant, center, of, islamic, religious, learning, with, al, jahiz, contributing, to, the, formation, of, mu, tazili, theology, as, well, as, al, tabari, culminating, in, the, scholarship, on, the, quranic, exegesis, baghdad, is, likely, to, have, been, the, largest, city, in, the, world, from, shortly, after, its, foundation, until, the, 930s, when, it, tied, with, c, rdoba, several, estimates, suggest, that, the, city, contained, over, a, million, inhabitants, at, its, peak, many, of, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, tales, widely, known, as, the, arabian, nights, are, set, in, baghdad, during, this, period, it, would, surpass, even, constantinople, in, prosperity, and, size, among, the, notable, features, of, baghdad, during, this, period, were, its, exceptional, libraries, many, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, were, patrons, of, learning, and, enjoyed, collecting, both, ancient, and, contemporary, literature, although, some, of, the, princes, of, the, previous, umayyad, dynasty, had, begun, to, gather, and, translate, greek, scientific, literature, the, abbasids, were, the, first, to, foster, greek, learning, on, a, large, scale, many, of, these, libraries, were, private, collections, intended, only, for, the, use, of, the, owners, and, their, immediate, friends, but, the, libraries, of, the, caliphs, and, other, officials, soon, took, on, a, public, or, a, semi, public, character, four, great, libraries, were, established, in, baghdad, during, this, period, the, earliest, was, that, of, the, famous, al, ma, mun, who, was, caliph, from, 813, to, 833, another, was, established, by, sabur, ibn, ardashir, in, 991, or, 993, for, the, literary, men, and, scholars, who, frequented, his, academy, this, second, library, was, plundered, and, burned, by, the, seljuks, only, seventy, years, after, it, was, established, this, was, a, good, example, of, the, sort, of, library, built, up, out, of, the, needs, and, interests, of, a, literary, society, the, last, two, were, examples, of, madrasa, or, theological, college, libraries, the, nezamiyeh, was, founded, by, the, persian, nizam, al, mulk, who, was, vizier, of, two, early, seljuk, sultans, it, continued, to, operate, even, after, the, coming, of, the, mongols, in, 1258, the, mustansiriyah, madrasa, which, owned, an, exceedingly, rich, library, was, founded, by, al, mustansir, the, second, last, abbasid, caliph, who, died, in, 1242, this, would, prove, to, be, the, last, great, library, built, by, the, caliphs, of, baghdad, by, the, 10th, century, the, city, s, population, was, between, 1, 2, million, and, 2, million, baghdad, s, early, meteoric, growth, eventually, slowed, due, to, troubles, within, the, caliphate, including, relocations, of, the, capital, to, samarra, during, 808, 819, and, 836, 892, the, loss, of, the, western, and, easternmost,

petitioned, to, the, fatimid, imam, caliph, al, mustansir, to, support, him, in, conquering, baghdad, on, the, ismaili, imam, s, behalf, it, has, recently, come, to, light, that, the, famed, fatimid, da, i, al, mu, ayyad, al, shirazi, had, a, direct, role, in, supporting, al, basasiri, and, helped, the, general, to, succeed, in, taking, maw, il, w, sit, and, kufa, soon, after, by, december, 1058, a, shi, i, adh, n, call, to, prayer, was, implemented, in, baghdad, and, a, khutbah, sermon, was, delivered, in, the, name, of, the, fatimid, imam, caliph, despite, his, shi, i, inclinations, al,

baghdad, continued, into, a, period, of, decline, partially, as, a, result, of, the, enmity, between, its, rulers, and, iranian, safavids, which, did, not, accept, the, sunni, control, of, the, city, between, 1623, and, 1638, it, returned, to, iranian, rule, before, falling, back, into, ottoman, hands, baghdad, has, suffered, severely, from, visitations, of, the, plague, and, cholera, and,
