cho, literally, big, river, inuvialuktun, kuukpak, literally, great, river, is, a, river, in, the, canadian, boreal, forest, it, forms, along, with, the, slave, peace, and, finlay, the, longest, river, system, in, canada, and, includes, the, second, largest, drainage, basin, of, any, north, american, river, after, the, mississippi, the, mackenzie, river, flows, through, a, vast, thinly, populated, region, of, forest, and, tundra, entirely, within, the, northwest, territories, in, canada, although, its, many, tributaries, reach, into, five, other, canadian, provinces, and, territories, the, river, s, main, stem, is, 1, 738, kilometres, 1, 080, mi, long, flowing, north, northwest, from, great, slave, lake, into, the, arctic, ocean, where, it, forms, a, large, delta, at, its, mouth, its, extensive, watershed, drains, about, 20, percent, of, canada, it, is, the, largest, river, flowing, into, the, arctic, from, north, america, and, including, its, tributaries, has, a, total, length, of, 4, 241, kilometres, 2, 635, mi, making, it, the, thirteenth, longest, river, system, in, the, world, the, ultimate, source, of, the, mackenzie, river, is, thutade, lake, in, the, northern, interior, of, british, columbia, the, mackenzie, valley, is, believed, to, have, been, the, path, taken, by, prehistoric, peoples, during, the, initial, human, migration, from, asia, to, north, america, over, 10, 000, years, ago, despite, sparse, evidence, the, inuvialuit, gwich, in, and, other, indigenous, peoples, lived, along, the, river, for, thousands, of, years, the, river, provided, the, major, route, into, canada, s, northern, interior, for, early, european, explorers, economic, development, remains, limited, along, the, river, during, the, 19th, century, fur, trading, became, a, lucrative, business, but, this, was, affected, by, harsh, weather, conditions, the, discovery, of, oil, at, norman, wells, in, the, 1920s, began, a, period, of, industrialization, in, the, mackenzie, valley, metallic, minerals, have, been, found, along, the, eastern, and, southern, edges, of, the, basin, these, include, uranium, gold, lead, and, zinc, agriculture, remains, prevalent, along, the, south, particularly, in, the, peace, river, area, various, tributaries, and, headwaters, of, the, river, have, been, developed, for, hydroelectricity, production, flood, control, and, irrigation, through, its, many, tributaries, the, mackenzie, river, basin, covers, portions, of, five, canadian, provinces, and, territories, british, columbia, bc, alberta, saskatchewan, yukon, and, northwest, territories, thutade, lake, in, the, northern, interior, of, bc, is, the, ultimate, source, of, the, mackenzie, river, via, the, finlay, peace, river, system, which, stretches, 1, 923, kilometres, 1, 195, mi, through, bc, and, alberta, the, 1, 231, kilometre, 765, mi, athabasca, river, originates, further, south, in, jasper, national, park, in, southwest, alberta, together, the, peace, and, athabasca, rivers, drain, a, significant, portion, of, the, eastern, slope, of, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, central, alberta, prairie, the, peace, contributes, the, majority, of, the, water, about, 66, km, 3, 54, million, acre, feet, per, year, and, the, athabasca, contributes, 25, km, 3, 20, million, acre, feet, the, peace, and, athabasca, meet, at, the, peace, athabasca, delta, a, vast, inland, delta, at, the, western, end, of, lake, athabasca, which, also, takes, runoff, from, the, northern, third, of, saskatchewan, the, slave, river, is, formed, by, the, confluence, of, the, two, rivers, and, flows, 415, kilometres, 258, mi, due, north, into, great, slave, lake, at, fort, resolution, northwest, territories, the, slave, is, by, far, the, largest, river, flowing, into, the, lake, with, an, annual, flow, of, 108, km, 3, 87, million, acre, feet, it, contributes, about, 77, of, the, overall, inflow, and, forms, a, large, delta, where, it, enters, the, lake, other, rivers, entering, great, slave, lake, are, the, taltson, lockhart, and, hay, rivers, the, latter, of, which, also, extends, into, alberta, and, bc, the, mackenzie, river, issues, from, the, western, end, of, great, slave, lake, about, 150, km, 93, mi, south, west, of, yellowknife, the, channel, is, initially, several, kilometres, wide, but, narrows, to, about, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, at, fort, providence, which, was, historically, an, important, ferry, crossing, in, the, summer, and, used, as, an, ice, bridge, in, the, winter, for, traffic, along, the, yellowknife, highway, in, 2012, the, deh, cho, bridge, was, completed, at, a, point, about, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, upstream, providing, a, safer, permanent, crossing, it, is, the, only, bridge, across, the, main, stem, of, the, mackenzie, west, of, fort, providence, the, mackenzie, widens, considerably, resembling, a, shallow, swampy, lake, more, than, a, river, one, large, widening, here, is, known, as, mills, lake, after, heading, west, for, about, 100, km, 62, mi, the, mackenzie, narrows, and, turns, northwest, through, a, long, stretch, of, fast, water, and, rapids, past, the, village, of, jean, marie, river, at, fort, simpson, it, is, joined, by, the, liard, river, its, biggest, direct, tributary, from, the, west, the, liard, drains, a, large, area, in, the, southern, yukon, and, northern, bc, and, carries, a, large, amount, of, sediment, during, the, summer, melt, which, does, not, fully, mix, with, the, clear, water, in, the, mackenzie, for, almost, 500, km, 310, mi, downstream, with, the, resulting, phenomenon, of, a, clear, current, on, the, east, bank, and, muddy, water, on, the, west, bank, the, river, continues, west, northwest, until, its, confluence, with, the, north, nahanni, river, where, it, turns, north, towards, the, arctic, it, flows, through, open, taiga, with, its, wide, valley, bounded, on, the, west, by, the, mackenzie, mountains, and, to, the, east, by, low, hills, of, the, canadian, shield, this, mostly, uninhabited, area, is, called, the, mackenzie, lowlands, although, partly, forested, it, is, mostly, covered, by, large, areas, of, muskeg, swamps, and, many, small, lakes, a, number, of, major, tributaries, join, from, the, west, including, the, root, river, redstone, river, and, keele, river, below, the, keele, river, the, mackenzie, river, flows, north, along, the, western, base, of, the, franklin, mountains, before, turning, northwest, and, receives, the, great, bear, river, the, outflow, of, great, bear, lake, at, tulita, the, mackenzie, widens, considerably, to, about, 6, to, 7, km, 3, 7, to, 4, 3, mi, at, norman, wells, a, major, center, of, oil, production, there, is, a, narrows, at, the, mountain, river, confluence, called, the, sans, sault, rapids, where, the, mackenzie, falls, about, 6, metres, 20, ft, below, the, mountain, river, the, mackenzie, flows, due, north, until, reaching, the, ramparts, a, limestone, gorge, barely, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, wide, and, up, to, 45, metres, 148, ft, deep, below, the, ramparts, is, the, village, of, fort, good, hope, where, the, mackenzie, turns, northwest, again, soon, crossing, the, arctic, circle, the, mackenzie, here, flows, slightly, lower, in, elevation, than, the, surrounding, tundra, as, a, braided, river, between, low, bluffs, about, 3, to, 5, km, 1, 9, to, 3, 1, mi, apart, it, receives, the, arctic, red, river, from, the, southwest, at, tsiigehtchic, where, traffic, on, the, dempster, highway, crosses, via, ferry, ice, bridge, about, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, northwest, of, tsiigehtchic, is, point, separation, the, head, of, the, vast, mackenzie, river, delta, whose, branching, channels, ponds, and, wetlands, spread, across, more, than, 12, 000, square, kilometres, 4, 600, sq, mi, of, the, coastal, plain, the, delta, is, nearly, 210, km, 130, mi, from, north, to, south, and, ranges, in, width, from, 50, to, 80, km, 31, to, 50, mi, it, is, the, second, biggest, arctic, delta, in, the, world, after, the, lena, river, delta, in, russia, most, land, in, the, mackenzie, delta, consists, of, permafrost, with, great, depths, to, bedrock, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, delta, is, its, numerous, pingos, or, hills, of, earth, covered, ice, some, 1, 400, of, them, the, peel, river, carrying, much, of, the, runoff, from, the, northern, yukon, joins, in, the, delta, at, a, point, northeast, of, fort, mcpherson, below, there, the, mackenzie, diverges, into, several, large, channels, with, the, largest, heading, north, northeast, emptying, into, the, beaufort, sea, west, of, tuktoyaktuk, the, mackenzie, delta, contains, a, logjam, with, 400, 000, caches, of, wood, which, stores, 3, 4, million, tons, of, carbon, equivalent, to, a, year, s, emissions, from, 2, 5, million, cars, at, 1, 805, 000, km, 2, 697, 000, sq, mi, the, mackenzie, river, drainage, basin, encompasses, nearly, 20, percent, of, canada, about, 980, 000, km, 2, 380, 000, sq, mi, or, 54, percent, of, the, basin, lies, above, great, slave, lake, permafrost, underlies, about, three, quarters, of, the, watershed, reaching, up, to, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, in, the, mackenzie, delta, as, a, whole, the, mackenzie, basin, receives, only, meager, to, moderate, rainfall, averaging, 410, millimetres, 16, in, over, the, entire, basin, though, mountain, areas, experience, much, higher, precipitation, and, areas, near, and, north, of, the, arctic, circle, receive, much, lower, precipitation, the, mackenzie, drainage, basin, is, bordered, by, multiple, major, north, american, watersheds, much, of, the, western, edge, of, the, mackenzie, basin, runs, along, the, continental, divide, the, divide, separates, the, mackenzie, watershed, from, that, of, the, yukon, river, which, flows, to, the, bering, strait, and, the, fraser, river, and, columbia, river, systems, both, of, which, empty, into, the, pacific, ocean, lowland, divides, in, the, north, separate, the, mackenzie, basin, from, the, arctic, ocean, watersheds, of, the, anderson, horton, coppermine, and, back, rivers, in, the, east, the, mackenzie, borders, on, the, hudson, bay, watersheds, of, the, thelon, and, churchill, rivers, and, to, the, south, it, is, bordered, by, the, saskatchewan, nelson, river, system, which, also, empties, into, hudson, bay, the, mackenzie, system, is, hydrologically, connected, to, the, hudson, bay, watershed, via, wollaston, lake, which, is, not, only, the, source, of, the, fond, du, lac, tributary, of, lake, athabasca, but, also, of, the, cochrane, river, which, flows, east, into, the, churchill, river, the, eastern, portion, of, the, mackenzie, basin, is, dominated, by, vast, reaches, of, lake, studded, boreal, forest, and, includes, many, of, the, largest, lakes, in, north, america, by, both, volume, and, surface, area, great, bear, lake, is, the, biggest, in, the, watershed, and, third, largest, on, the, continent, with, a, surface, area, of, 31, 153, km, 2, 12, 028, sq, mi, and, a, volume, of, 2, 236, km, 3, 536, cu, mi, great, slave, lake, is, slightly, smaller, with, an, area, of, 28, 568, km, 2, 11, 030, sq, mi, and, containing, 2, 088, km, 3, 501, cu, mi, of, water, although, it, is, significantly, deeper, than, great, bear, the, third, major, lake, athabasca, is, less, than, a, third, that, size, with, an, area, of, 7, 800, km, 2, 3, 000, sq, mi, six, other, lakes, in, the, watershed, cover, more, than, 1, 000, km, 2, 390, sq, mi, including, the, williston, lake, reservoir, the, second, largest, artificial, lake, in, north, america, on, the, peace, river, the, river, discharges, more, than, 325, cubic, kilometres, 78, cu, mi, of, water, each, year, accounting, for, roughly, 11, of, the, total, river, flow, into, the, arctic, ocean, the, river, is, frozen, for, most, of, the, year, with, the, ice, typically, breaking, up, by, early, to, mid, may, in, the, south, and, late, may, early, june, in, the, north, ice, breaks, up, earlier, on, the, tributaries, sometimes, causing, ice, jams, and, flooding, where, they, meet, the, mackenzie, in, the, middle, of, the, larger, lakes, such, as, great, slave, ice, can, persist, as, late, as, mid, june, the, river, typically, freezes, by, late, october, or, november, starting, in, the, north, year, round, the, mackenzie, s, outflow, has, a, major, stabilizing, effect, in, the, local, climate, above, the, arctic, ocean, with, large, amounts, of, warmer, fresh, water, mixing, with, the, cold, seawater, the, average, flow, rate, at, the, mouth, is, 9, 910, m, 3, s, 350, 000, cu, ft, s, the, second, largest, in, canada, after, the, st, lawrence, and, the, fourteenth, largest, in, the, world, about, 60, percent, of, the, water, comes, from, the, western, half, of, the, basin, which, includes, the, rocky, selwyn, and, mackenzie, mountain, ranges, out, of, which, spring, major, tributaries, such, as, the, peace, and, liard, rivers, which, contribute, 23, and, 27, percent, of, the, total, flow, respectively, in, contrast, the, eastern, half, despite, being, dominated, by, marshland, and, large, lakes, provides, only, about, 25, percent, of, the, mackenzie, s, discharge, during, peak, flow, in, the, spring, the, difference, in, discharge, between, the, two, halves, of, the, watershed, becomes, even, more, marked, while, large, amounts, of, snow, and, glacial, melt, dramatically, drive, up, water, levels, in, the, mackenzie, s, western, tributaries, large, lakes, to, the, east, retard, springtime, discharges, spring, floods, from, the, peace, athabasca, system, are, significantly, slowed, by, the, delta, area, at, the, western, end, of, lake, athabasca, causing, the, lake, to, rise, and, the, excess, water, can, only, flow, out, after, the, rivers, have, receded, the, same, phenomenon, occurs, at, great, slave, lake, which, naturally, regulates, the, flow, from, the, slave, river, into, the, mackenzie, there, are, river, gauges, at, several, upstream, points, along, the, mackenzie, river, the, average, flow, rate, at, the, outlet, of, great, slave, lake, is, 4, 269, m, 3, s, 150, 800, cu, ft, s, at, fort, simpson, below, the, liard, river, it, is, 6, 769, m, 3, s, 239, 000, cu, ft, s, at, norman, wells, it, is, 8, 446, m, 3, s, 298, 300, cu, ft, s, and, at, the, arctic, red, confluence, it, is, 8, 926, m, 3, s, 315, 200, cu, ft, s, mackenzie, monthly, mean, discharge, at, arctic, red, river, m, 3, s, as, recently, as, the, last, glacial, maximum, about, 30, 000, years, ago, the, majority, of, northern, canada, was, buried, under, the, enormous, continental, laurentide, ice, sheet, the, tremendous, erosive, powers, of, the, laurentide, and, its, predecessors, at, maximum, extent, completely, buried, what, is, now, the, mackenzie, watershed, under, thousands, of, metres, of, ice, and, flattened, the, eastern, portions, of, the, watershed, when, the, ice, sheet, receded, for, the, last, time, it, left, a, 1, 100, km, 680, mi, long, proglacial, lake, lake, mcconnell, of, which, great, bear, great, slave, and, athabasca, lakes, are, remnants, today, s, mackenzie, river, is, very, young, in, geologic, terms, its, channel, formed, over, a, period, of, no, more, than, several, thousand, years, as, the, ice, sheet, retreated, prior, to, the, ice, ages, only, the, peel, river, tributary, flowed, through, what, is, now, the, mackenzie, delta, into, the, arctic, ocean, the, other, tributaries, of, the, mackenzie, combined, into, the, bell, river, which, flowed, east, into, hudson, bay, during, glaciation, the, weight, of, the, ice, sheet, depressed, northern, canada, s, terrain, to, such, an, extent, that, when, the, ice, retreated, the, mackenzie, system, was, captured, to, lower, elevations, in, the, northwest, establishing, the, present, flow, direction, to, the, arctic, fluvial, deposits, and, other, erosional, evidence, indicate, that, around, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, about, 13, 000, years, ago, the, mackenzie, channel, was, scoured, by, one, or, more, massive, glacial, lake, outburst, floods, unleashed, from, lake, agassiz, formed, by, melting, ice, west, of, the, present, day, great, lakes, at, its, peak, agassiz, had, a, greater, volume, than, all, present, day, freshwater, lakes, combined, this, is, believed, to, have, disrupted, currents, in, the, arctic, ocean, and, led, to, an, abrupt, 1, 300, year, long, cold, temperature, shift, called, the, younger, dryas, the, mackenzie, carries, a, very, large, sediment, load, transporting, about, 128, million, tonnes, each, year, to, its, delta, the, liard, river, alone, accounts, for, 32, percent, of, the, total, and, the, peel, river, about, 20, percent, essentially, all, of, the, sediment, is, contributed, by, areas, downstream, of, fort, providence, since, upstream, sediment, is, trapped, in, great, slave, lake, the, mackenzie, river, s, watershed, is, considered, one, of, the, largest, and, most, intact, ecosystems, in, north, america, especially, the, northern, half, approximately, 63, of, the, drainage, basin, or, 1, 137, 000, km, 2, 439, 000, sq, mi, is, forested, mostly, boreal, forest, wetlands, comprise, about, 18, or, about, 324, 900, km, 2, 125, 400, sq, mi, of, the, basin, more, than, 93, of, forested, areas, are, virgin, old, growth, forest, however, human, activities, such, as, oil, extraction, have, threatened, water, quality, in, the, headwaters, of, the, mackenzie, river, in, addition, a, warming, climate, in, northern, parts, of, the, watershed, is, melting, permafrost, and, destabilizing, soil, through, erosion, most, of, the, taiga, consists, of, black, spruce, aspen, and, poplar, forest, in, the, north, the, river, s, shores, are, lined, with, sparse, vegetation, like, dwarf, birch, and, willows, as, well, as, extensive, areas, of, muskeg, and, peat, bogs, south, of, great, slave, lake, there, are, much, larger, reaches, of, temperate, and, alpine, forest, prairie, and, fertile, floodplain, and, riparian, habitat, there, are, 53, fish, species, in, the, basin, none, of, them, endemic, the, mackenzie, river, has, a, similar, range, of, fish, fauna, to, the, mississippi, river, system, it, is, believed, that, the, two, river, systems, were, connected, during, the, ice, ages, by, meltwater, lakes, and, channels, allowing, fish, in, the, two, rivers, to, interbreed, fish, in, the, mackenzie, river, proper, include, the, northern, pike, several, minnow, species, and, lake, whitefish, fish, in, the, southern, half, of, the, watershed, are, genetically, isolated, from, those, of, the, northern, half, due, to, large, rapids, on, the, slave, river, preventing, fish, from, swimming, upstream, migratory, birds, use, the, three, major, deltas, in, the, mackenzie, river, basin, the, mackenzie, delta, and, the, inland, slave, and, peace, athabasca, deltas, as, resting, and, breeding, areas, the, latter, is, located, at, the, convergence, of, four, major, north, american, migratory, routes, or, flyways, as, recently, as, the, mid, twentieth, century, more, than, 400, 000, birds, passed, through, during, the, spring, and, up, to, a, million, in, autumn, some, 215, bird, species, in, total, have, been, catalogued, in, the, delta, including, species, such, as, the, whooping, crane, peregrine, falcon, and, bald, eagle, the, construction, of, the, w, a, c, bennett, dam, on, the, peace, river, has, reduced, the, seasonal, variations, of, water, levels, in, the, delta, causing, damage, to, its, ecosystem, bird, populations, have, seen, a, steady, decline, since, the, 1960s, water, mammals, such, as, beavers, and, muskrats, are, extremely, common, in, the, mackenzie, delta, and, surrounding, areas, of, muskeg, the, mackenzie, estuary, is, also, a, calving, area, for, beluga, whales, the, mackenzie, valley, is, believed, to, have, been, the, path, taken, by, prehistoric, peoples, during, the, initial, human, migration, from, asia, to, north, america, more, than, 10, 000, years, ago, however, archaeological, evidence, of, human, habitation, along, the, mackenzie, is, scant, despite, the, efforts, of, many, researchers, many, archaeological, sites, have, probably, been, destroyed, by, flooding, freeze, thaw, and, erosion, the, inuvialuit, gwich, in, and, other, indigenous, peoples, have, lived, along, the, river, for, thousands, of, years, however, the, oldest, known, evidence, of, continuous, occupation, stretches, back, only, about, 1300, 1400, years, at, the, gwich, in, community, of, tsiigehtchic, the, mackenzie, provided, the, major, route, into, canada, s, northern, interior, for, european, explorers, as, early, as, the, late, 18th, century, scottish, explorer, alexander, mackenzie, travelled, the, river, in, the, hope, it, would, lead, to, the, pacific, ocean, but, instead, reached, its, mouth, on, the, arctic, ocean, on, 14, july, 1789, there, is, a, story, likely, apocryphal, that, he, named, it, disappointment, river, but, eventually, it, was, named, after, him, no, european, reached, its, mouth, again, until, sir, john, franklin, on, 16, august, 1825, during, the, 1825, 1827, mackenzie, river, expedition, the, following, year, he, traced, the, coast, west, until, blocked, by, ice, while, john, richardson, followed, the, coast, east, to, the, coppermine, river, in, 1849, william, pullen, reached, the, mackenzie, from, the, bering, strait, in, the, following, decades, the, north, west, company, established, forts, on, the, river, the, precursors, of, present, day, settlements, such, as, fort, simpson, formerly, fort, of, the, forks, a, lucrative, fur, trade, was, carried, out, as, the, mackenzie, basin, teemed, with, beaver, and, muskrat, however, the, short, summer, and, harsh, winter, conditions, limited, trappers, activities, during, the, late, 19th, century, fort, simpson, was, regional, headquarters, for, the, hudson, s, bay, company, the, first, fur, trappers, were, native, but, starting, in, the, 1920s, increasing, numbers, of, european, trappers, entered, the, region, beaver, and, muskrat, populations, were, heavily, depleted, especially, in, areas, around, and, south, of, great, slave, lake, catholic, missionary, henri, grollier, founded, missions, at, fort, simpson, fort, norman, and, fort, good, hope, between, 1858, and, 1859, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, epidemics, of, introduced, european, diseases, swept, through, indigenous, communities, along, the, river, and, thousands, of, native, people, lost, their, lives, one, particularly, severe, influenza, in, 1928, killed, as, many, as, one, in, ten, native, people, along, the, mackenzie, river, fort, providence, lost, 20, percent, of, its, population, and, some, smaller, villages, and, camps, were, completely, wiped, out, steamboat, service, on, the, mackenzie, river, began, in, the, 1880s, and, the, number, of, vessels, surged, in, the, early, 1900s, as, the, klondike, gold, rush, brought, a, wave, of, prospectors, to, the, yukon, the, mackenzie, river, was, one, of, the, main, routes, into, the, northern, interior, with, sternwheelers, transporting, passengers, domestic, supplies, and, industrial, goods, from, as, far, upstream, as, the, athabasca, river, all, the, way, to, the, delta, though, with, several, areas, such, as, the, huge, rapids, on, the, slave, river, requiring, portages, the, route, taken, by, gold, seekers, started, in, edmonton, and, followed, the, athabasca, slave, and, mackenzie, rivers, as, far, as, the, peel, river, then, up, the, peel, and, its, tributary, the, rat, river, to, the, headwaters, of, the, porcupine, river, which, flows, to, the, yukon, river, many, who, attempted, the, 3, 200, kilometre, 2, 000, mi, journey, died, along, the, way, or, turned, back, before, reaching, the, yukon, oil, was, discovered, at, norman, wells, in, the, 1920s, beginning, a, period, of, industrialization, in, the, mackenzie, valley, oil, was, initially, shipped, out, by, steamboats, supplying, mines, and, towns, across, the, nwt, this, demand, grew, when, gold, was, discovered, on, the, northern, shore, of, great, slave, lake, leading, to, the, settlement, of, yellowknife, and, the, opening, of, several, mines, in, the, area, by, the, 1940s, steamboats, had, been, replaced, by, modern, gas, and, diesel, powered, craft, which, continue, to, serve, the, river, today, during, world, war, ii, oil, pumped, in, norman, wells, was, shipped, to, fairbanks, alaska, via, the, 1, 000, kilometre, 620, mi, canol, pipeline, the, pipeline, was, considered, a, fiasco, going, five, times, over, budget, and, losing, as, much, as, 20, percent, of, the, oil, due, to, poor, construction, it, only, operated, for, thirteen, months, shutting, down, in, 1945, much, abandoned, equipment, remains, along, the, corridor, today, part, of, the, pipeline, route, has, been, designated, the, canol, heritage, trail, in, 1964, the, mackenzie, northern, railway, now, a, subsidiary, of, cn, reached, the, shore, of, great, slave, lake, to, serve, the, new, pine, point, zinc, mine, near, hay, river, although, the, mine, shut, down, in, 1988, the, railroad, remains, an, important, transportation, link, between, the, mackenzie, river, waterway, and, the, rest, of, canada, in, the, 1950s, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, proposed, the, north, american, water, and, power, alliance, nawapa, a, vast, series, of, dams, tunnels, and, reservoirs, designed, to, move, 150, km, 3, 120, 000, 000, acre, ft, of, water, from, northern, canada, to, southern, canada, the, western, united, states, and, mexico, the, system, would, involve, building, massive, dams, on, the, liard, mackenzie, peace, columbia, and, fraser, river, systems, and, pumping, water, into, a, 650, km, 400, mi, long, reservoir, in, the, rocky, mountain, trench, the, water, would, then, flow, by, gravity, to, irrigate, more, than, 220, 000, km, 2, 85, 000, sq, mi, in, the, three, countries, and, generate, more, than, 50, 000, mw, of, surplus, energy, the, projects, were, never, built, due, to, the, massive, cost, and, environmental, impact, the, royal, canadian, mint, honoured, the, 200th, anniversary, of, the, naming, of, the, mackenzie, river, with, the, issue, of, a, silver, commemorative, dollar, in, 1989, in, 1997, a, cultural, landscape, along, the, section, of, the, mackenzie, river, at, tsiigehtchic, was, designated, the, nagwichoonjik, mackenzie, river, national, historic, site, of, canada, due, to, its, cultural, social, and, spiritual, significance, to, the, gwichya, gwich, in, in, 2008, canadian, and, japanese, researchers, extracted, a, constant, stream, of, natural, gas, from, a, test, project, at, the, mallik, methane, hydrate, field, in, the, mackenzie, delta, this, was, the, second, such, drilling, at, mallik, the, first, took, place, in, 2002, and, used, heat, to, release, methane, in, the, 2008, experiment, researchers, were, able, to, extract, gas, by, lowering, the, pressure, without, heating, requiring, significantly, less, energy, the, mallik, gas, hydrate, field, was, first, discovered, by, imperial, oil, in, 1971, 1972, as, of, 2001, approximately, 400, 000, people, lived, in, the, mackenzie, river, basin, representing, only, one, percent, of, canada, s, population, ninety, percent, of, the, population, lived, in, the, peace, and, athabasca, river, basins, mostly, in, alberta, the, cold, northern, permafrost, regions, beyond, the, arctic, circle, are, very, sparsely, populated, mainly, by, indigenous, peoples, most, of, the, mackenzie, watershed, is, unbroken, wilderness, and, human, activities, have, little, influence, on, the, overall, water, quality, although, there, are, some, localized, impacts, some, parts, of, the, mackenzie, basin, are, rich, in, natural, resources, oil, and, gas, in, the, northwest, territories, and, in, central, alberta, lumber, in, the, peace, river, headwaters, uranium, in, saskatchewan, gold, and, zinc, in, the, great, slave, lake, area, and, tungsten, in, the, yukon, as, of, 2003, there, were, two, operational, gold, mines, in, yellowknife, and, many, more, abandoned, mines, dot, the, region, communities, along, the, mackenzie, river, depend, on, subsistence, fishing, although, there, is, also, some, commercial, fishing, on, the, river, agriculture, in, the, mackenzie, river, basin, is, mainly, concentrated, in, the, peace, and, athabasca, valleys, to, the, south, the, valley, of, the, former, river, is, considered, to, be, some, of, the, best, northern, farmland, in, canada, due, to, the, high, concentration, of, minerals, found, in, the, soil, these, conditions, are, expected, to, be, improved, even, more, by, trends, in, climate, change, such, as, warmer, temperatures, and, a, longer, growing, season, according, to, the, british, columbia, environmental, network, there, is, enough, agricultural, capability, in, the, peace, river, valley, to, provide, vegetables, to, all, of, northern, canada, the, only, functioning, oil, pipeline, in, the, mackenzie, basin, connects, norman, wells, with, zama, city, alberta, norman, wells, was, the, main, oil, producing, area, on, the, mackenzie, river, until, the, 1970s, when, new, oil, fields, were, discovered, further, north, in, the, mackenzie, delta, and, the, surrounding, coastline, as, of, 2016, there, were, an, estimated, 166, billion, barrels, of, oil, reserves, in, this, region, there, is, a, proposal, for, a, mackenzie, valley, pipeline, which, has, not, been, built, due, to, environmental, concerns, and, falling, oil, and, gas, prices, during, the, ice, free, season, the, mackenzie, is, a, major, transportation, link, through, the, vast, wilderness, of, northern, canada, linking, the, many, isolated, communities, along, its, course, wide, calm, sections, of, the, river, are, frequently, used, to, land, seaplanes, in, the, ice, free, season, canada, s, northernmost, major, railhead, is, located, at, the, town, of, hay, river, on, the, south, shore, of, great, slave, lake, goods, shipped, there, by, train, and, truck, are, loaded, onto, barges, of, the, government, owned, marine, transportation, services, in, 2016, northern, transportation, company, went, bankrupt, and, its, assets, were, bought, by, the, government, of, northwest, territories, barge, traffic, travels, the, entire, length, of, the, mackenzie, in, long, trains, of, up, to, fifteen, shallow, draft, vessels, pulled, by, tugboats, goods, are, shipped, as, far, as, the, port, of, tuktoyaktuk, on, the, eastern, end, of, the, mackenzie, delta, where, they, are, transferred, to, oceangoing, vessels, and, delivered, to, communities, along, canada, s, arctic, coast, and, the, numerous, islands, to, the, north, in, winter, the, frozen, channel, of, the, mackenzie, river, especially, in, the, delta, region, is, used, as, an, ice, road, firm, enough, to, support, large, trucks, although, travel, between, northern, communities, is, mostly, by, dog, sleds, and, snowmobiles, although, the, mackenzie, river, is, wide, and, deep, navigation, is, notoriously, difficult, due, to, the, locations, of, sandbars, and, shallows, changing, from, year, to, year, in, some, narrower, parts, of, the, river, barges, must, be, uncoupled, and, towed, one, by, one, through, hazardous, stretches, despite, attempts, to, widen, and, deepening, the, channel, by, blasting, although, there, are, no, dams, along, the, main, stem, of, the, mackenzie, many, of, its, tributaries, and, headwaters, have, been, developed, for, hydroelectricity, production, flood, control, and, irrigation, the, w, a, c, bennett, and, peace, canyon, hydroelectric, dams, on, the, upper, peace, river, were, completed, in, 1968, and, 1980, by, bc, hydro, they, have, a, combined, capacity, of, more, than, 3, 600, megawatts, mw, the, reservoir, of, w, a, c, bennett, williston, lake, is, the, largest, body, of, fresh, water, in, bc, and, the, ninth, largest, man, made, lake, in, the, world, with, a, volume, of, 70, 3, km, 3, 57, 000, 000, acre, ft, other, smaller, hydroelectric, plants, are, located, along, the, snare, and, taltson, river, tributaries, providing, power, to, mines, in, the, great, slave, lake, region, by, acting, as, a, massive, stabilizer, on, the, water, flow, of, the, peace, river, williston, lake, reduces, flood, crests, on, the, peace, slave, and, mackenzie, rivers, as, far, downstream, as, fort, good, hope, this, has, made, the, peace, valley, more, suitable, for, farming, but, has, had, significant, impacts, on, downstream, wildlife, and, riparian, communities, the, more, stable, annual, flow, slows, down, the, spread, of, essential, nutrients, which, builds, up, in, the, form, of, sediments, thus, causing, the, river, to, become, more, polluted, there, have, been, many, proposals, to, dam, the, tributaries, of, the, mackenzie, river, which, would, lead, to, further, impacts, on, water, quality, and, seasonal, flow, patterns, a, potential, us, 1, billion, 1350, mw, hydro, plant, on, the, slave, river, was, canceled, in, 2010, after, an, agreement, could, not, be, reached, with, first, nations, people, in, the, area, to, be, flooded, by, the, reservoir, the, site, c, dam, on, the, peace, river, which, would, generate, enough, power, for, about, 460, 000, households, has, been, controversial, since, the, 1970s, as, of, april, 2019, despite, multiple, legal, challenges, by, first, nations, and, environmental, groups, the, dam, was, under, construction, with, a, completion, date, scheduled, for, 2024
