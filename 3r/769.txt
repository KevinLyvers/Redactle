of, a, causeway, to, the, nearby, island, of, pharos, that, would, generate, two, great, natural, harbours, alexandria, was, intended, to, supersede, the, older, greek, colony, of, naucratis, as, a,

visit, paid, by, king, agrippa, i, to, alexandria, principally, over, the, respect, paid, by, the, herodian, nation, to, the, roman, emperor, which, quickly, escalated, to, open, affronts, and, violence, between, the, two, ethnic, groups, and, the, desecration, of, alexandrian, synagogues, this, event, has, been, called, the, alexandrian, pogroms, the, violence, was, quelled, after, caligula, intervened, and, had, the, roman, governor, flaccus, removed, from, the, city, in, 115, ad, large, parts, of, alexandria, were, destroyed, during, the, diaspora, revolt, which, gave, hadrian, and, his, architect, decriannus, an, opportunity, to, rebuild, it, in, 215, ad, the, emperor, caracalla, visited, the, city, and, because, of, some, insulting, satires, that, the,

in, their, country, alexandria, lost, much, of, its, importance, in, international, trade, after, portuguese, navigators, discovered, a, new, sea, route, to, india, in, the, late, 15th, century, this, reduced, the, amount, of, goods, that, needed, to, be, transported, through, the, alexandrian, port, as, well, as, the, mamluks, political, power, after, the, battle, of, ridaniya, in, 1517, the, city, was, conquered, by, the, ottoman, turks, and, remained, under, ottoman, rule, until, 1798, alexandria, lost, much, of, its, former, importance, to, the, egyptian, port, city, of, rosetta, during, the, 9th, to, 18th, centuries, and, it, only, regained, its, former, prominence, with, the, construction, of, the, mahmoudiyah, canal, in, 1820, alexandria, figured, prominently, in, the, military, operations, of, napoleon, s, expedition, to, egypt, in, 1798, french, troops, stormed, the, city, on, 2, july, 1798, and, it, remained, in, their, hands, until, the, arrival, of, a, british,
