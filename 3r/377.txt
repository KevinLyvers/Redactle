the, outback, is, a, remote, vast, sparsely, populated, area, of, australia, the, outback, is, more, remote, than, the, bush, while, often, envisaged, as, being, arid, the, outback, regions, extend, from, the, northern, to, southern, australian, coastlines, and, encompass, a, number, of, climatic, zones, including, tropical, and, monsoonal, climates, in, northern, areas, arid, areas, in, the, red, centre, and, semi, arid, and, temperate, climates, in, southerly, regions, the, total, population, is, estimated, at, 607, 000, people, geographically, the, outback, is, unified, by, a, combination, of, factors, most, notably, a, low, human, population, density, a, largely, intact, natural, environment, and, in, many, places, low, intensity, land, uses, such, as, pastoralism, livestock, grazing, in, which, production, is, reliant, on, the, natural, environment, the, outback, is, deeply, ingrained, in, australian, heritage, history, and, folklore, in, australian, art, the, subject, of, the, outback, has, been, vogue, particularly, in, the, 1940s, in, 2009, as, part, of, the, q150, celebrations, the, queensland, outback, was, announced, as, one, of, the, q150, icons, of, queensland, for, its, role, as, a, natural, attraction, aboriginal, peoples, have, lived, in, the, outback, for, at, least, 50, 000, years, and, occupied, all, outback, regions, including, the, driest, deserts, when, europeans, first, entered, central, australia, in, the, 1800s, many, aboriginal, australians, retain, strong, physical, and, cultural, links, to, their, traditional, country, and, are, legally, recognised, as, the, traditional, owners, of, large, parts, of, the, outback, under, commonwealth, native, title, legislation, early, european, exploration, of, inland, australia, was, sporadic, more, focus, was, on, the, more, accessible, and, fertile, coastal, areas, the, first, party, to, successfully, cross, the, blue, mountains, just, outside, sydney, was, led, by, gregory, blaxland, in, 1813, 25, years, after, the, colony, was, established, people, starting, with, john, oxley, in, 1817, 1818, and, 1821, followed, by, charles, sturt, from, 1829, to, 1830, attempted, to, follow, the, westward, flowing, rivers, to, find, an, inland, sea, but, these, were, found, to, all, flow, into, the, murray, river, and, darling, river, which, turn, south, from, 1858, onwards, the, so, called, afghan, cameleers, and, their, beasts, played, an, instrumental, role, in, opening, up, the, outback, and, helping, to, build, infrastructure, over, the, period, 1858, to, 1861, john, mcdouall, stuart, led, six, expeditions, north, from, adelaide, south, australia, into, the, outback, culminating, in, successfully, reaching, the, north, coast, of, australia, and, returning, without, the, loss, of, any, of, the, party, s, members, lives, this, contrasts, with, the, ill, fated, burke, and, wills, expedition, in, 1860, 61, which, was, much, better, funded, but, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, three, of, the, members, of, the, transcontinental, party, the, overland, telegraph, line, was, constructed, in, the, 1870s, along, the, route, identified, by, stuart, in, 1865, the, surveyor, george, goyder, using, changes, in, vegetation, patterns, mapped, a, line, in, south, australia, north, of, which, he, considered, rainfall, to, be, too, unreliable, to, support, agriculture, exploration, of, the, outback, continued, in, the, 1950s, when, len, beadell, explored, surveyed, and, built, many, roads, in, support, of, the, nuclear, weapons, tests, at, emu, field, and, maralinga, and, rocket, testing, on, the, woomera, prohibited, area, mineral, exploration, continues, as, new, mineral, deposits, are, identified, and, developed, 2002, was, declared, the, year, of, the, outback, while, the, early, explorers, used, horses, to, cross, the, outback, the, first, woman, to, make, the, journey, riding, a, horse, was, anna, hingley, who, rode, from, broome, to, cairns, in, 2006, the, paucity, of, industrial, land, use, has, led, to, the, outback, being, recognised, globally, as, one, of, the, largest, remaining, intact, natural, areas, on, earth, global, human, footprint, and, wilderness, reviews, highlight, the, importance, of, outback, australia, as, one, of, the, world, s, large, natural, areas, along, with, the, boreal, forests, and, tundra, regions, in, north, america, the, sahara, and, gobi, deserts, and, the, tropical, forests, of, the, amazon, and, congo, basins, the, savanna, or, grassy, woodlands, of, northern, australia, are, the, largest, intact, savanna, regions, in, the, world, in, the, south, the, great, western, woodlands, which, occupy, 16, 000, 000, hectares, 40, 000, 000, acres, an, area, larger, than, all, of, england, and, wales, are, the, largest, remaining, temperate, woodland, left, on, earth, reflecting, the, wide, climatic, and, geological, variation, the, outback, contains, a, wealth, of, distinctive, and, ecologically, rich, ecosystems, major, land, types, include, the, outback, is, full, of, very, important, well, adapted, wildlife, although, much, of, it, may, not, be, immediately, visible, to, the, casual, observer, many, animals, such, as, red, kangaroos, and, dingoes, hide, in, bushes, to, rest, and, keep, cool, during, the, heat, of, the, day, birdlife, is, prolific, most, often, seen, at, waterholes, at, dawn, and, dusk, huge, flocks, of, budgerigars, cockatoos, corellas, and, galahs, are, often, sighted, on, bare, ground, or, roads, during, the, winter, various, species, of, snakes, and, lizards, bask, in, the, sun, but, they, are, rarely, seen, during, the, summer, months, feral, animals, such, as, camels, thrive, in, central, australia, brought, to, australia, by, pastoralists, and, explorers, along, with, the, early, afghan, drivers, feral, horses, known, as, brumbies, are, station, horses, that, have, run, wild, feral, pigs, foxes, cats, goats, and, rabbits, and, other, imported, animals, are, also, degrading, the, environment, so, time, and, money, is, spent, eradicating, them, in, an, attempt, to, help, protect, fragile, rangelands, the, outback, is, home, to, a, diverse, set, of, animal, species, such, as, the, kangaroo, emu, and, dingo, the, dingo, fence, was, built, to, restrict, movements, of, dingoes, and, wild, dogs, into, agricultural, areas, towards, the, south, east, of, the, continent, the, marginally, fertile, parts, are, primarily, utilised, as, rangelands, and, have, been, traditionally, used, for, sheep, or, cattle, grazing, on, cattle, stations, which, are, leased, from, the, federal, government, while, small, areas, of, the, outback, consist, of, clay, soils, the, majority, has, exceedingly, infertile, palaeosols, riversleigh, in, queensland, is, one, of, australia, s, most, renowned, fossil, sites, and, was, recorded, as, a, world, heritage, site, in, 1994, the, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, area, contains, fossil, remains, of, ancient, mammals, birds, and, reptiles, of, oligocene, and, miocene, age, the, largest, industry, across, the, outback, in, terms, of, the, area, occupied, is, pastoralism, in, which, cattle, sheep, and, sometimes, goats, are, grazed, in, mostly, intact, natural, ecosystems, widespread, use, of, bore, water, obtained, from, underground, aquifers, including, the, great, artesian, basin, has, enabled, livestock, to, be, grazed, across, vast, areas, in, which, no, permanent, surface, water, exists, naturally, capitalising, on, the, lack, of, pasture, improvement, and, absence, of, fertiliser, and, pesticide, use, many, outback, pastoral, properties, are, certified, as, organic, livestock, producers, in, 2014, 17, 000, 000, hectares, 42, 000, 000, acres, most, of, which, is, in, outback, australia, was, fully, certified, as, organic, farm, production, making, australia, the, largest, certified, organic, production, area, in, the, world, tourism, is, a, major, industry, across, the, outback, and, commonwealth, and, state, tourism, agencies, explicitly, target, outback, australia, as, a, desirable, destination, for, domestic, and, international, travellers, there, is, no, breakdown, of, tourism, revenues, for, the, outback, per, se, however, regional, tourism, is, a, major, component, of, national, tourism, incomes, tourism, australia, explicitly, markets, nature, based, and, indigenous, led, experiences, to, tourists, in, the, 2015, 2016, financial, year, 815, 000, visitors, spent, 988, million, while, on, holidays, in, the, northern, territory, alone, there, are, many, popular, tourist, attractions, in, the, outback, some, of, the, well, known, destinations, include, devils, marbles, kakadu, national, park, kata, tjuta, the, olgas, macdonnell, ranges, and, uluru, ayers, rock, other, than, agriculture, and, tourism, the, main, economic, activity, in, this, vast, and, sparsely, settled, area, is, mining, owing, to, the, almost, complete, absence, of, mountain, building, and, glaciation, since, the, permian, in, many, areas, since, the, cambrian, ages, the, outback, is, extremely, rich, in, iron, aluminium, manganese, and, uranium, ores, and, also, contains, major, deposits, of, gold, nickel, copper, lead, and, zinc, ores, because, of, its, size, the, value, of, grazing, and, mining, is, considerable, major, mines, and, mining, areas, in, the, outback, include, opals, at, coober, pedy, lightning, ridge, and, white, cliffs, metals, at, broken, hill, tennant, creek, olympic, dam, and, the, remote, challenger, mine, oil, and, gas, are, extracted, in, the, cooper, basin, around, moomba, in, western, australia, the, argyle, diamond, mine, in, the, kimberley, was, once, the, world, s, biggest, producer, of, natural, diamonds, and, contributed, approximately, one, third, of, the, world, s, natural, supply, but, was, closed, down, in, 2020, due, to, financial, reasons, the, pilbara, region, s, economy, is, dominated, by, mining, and, petroleum, industries, the, pilbara, s, oil, and, gas, industry, is, the, region, s, largest, export, industry, earned, 5, 0, billion, in, 2004, 05, accounting, for, over, 96, of, the, state, s, production, most, of, australia, s, iron, ore, is, also, mined, in, the, pilbara, and, it, also, has, one, of, the, world, s, major, manganese, mines, aboriginal, communities, in, outback, regions, such, as, the, anangu, pitjantjatjara, yankunytjatjara, lands, in, northern, south, australia, have, not, been, displaced, as, they, have, been, in, areas, of, intensive, agriculture, and, large, cities, in, coastal, areas, the, total, population, of, the, outback, in, australia, declined, from, 700, 000, in, 1996, to, 690, 000, in, 2006, the, largest, decline, was, in, the, outback, northern, territory, while, the, kimberley, and, pilbara, showed, population, increases, during, the, same, period, the, sex, ratio, is, 1040, males, for, 1000, females, and, 17, of, the, total, population, is, indigenous, the, royal, flying, doctor, service, rfds, started, service, in, 1928, and, helps, people, who, live, in, the, outback, of, australia, previously, serious, injuries, or, illnesses, often, meant, death, owing, to, the, lack, of, proper, medical, facilities, and, trained, personnel, in, many, outback, communities, the, number, of, children, is, too, small, for, a, conventional, school, to, operate, children, are, educated, at, home, by, the, school, of, the, air, originally, the, teachers, communicated, with, the, children, via, radio, but, now, satellite, telecommunication, is, used, instead, some, children, attend, boarding, school, mostly, only, those, in, secondary, school, the, term, outback, derives, from, the, adverbial, phrase, referring, to, the, back, yard, of, a, house, and, came, to, be, used, meiotically, in, the, late, 1800s, to, describe, the, vast, sparsely, settled, regions, of, australia, behind, the, cities, and, towns, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, term, in, this, context, in, print, was, in, 1869, when, the, writer, clearly, meant, the, area, west, of, wagga, wagga, new, south, wales, over, time, the, adverbial, use, of, the, phrase, was, replaced, with, the, present, day, noun, form, it, is, colloquially, said, that, the, outback, is, located, beyond, the, black, stump, the, location, of, the, black, stump, may, be, some, hypothetical, location, or, may, vary, depending, on, local, custom, and, folklore, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, term, comes, from, the, black, stump, wine, saloon, that, once, stood, about, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, out, of, coolah, new, south, wales, on, the, gunnedah, road, it, is, claimed, that, the, saloon, named, after, the, nearby, black, stump, run, and, black, stump, creek, was, an, important, staging, post, for, traffic, to, north, west, new, south, wales, and, it, became, a, marker, by, which, people, gauged, their, journeys, the, never, never, is, a, term, referring, to, remoter, parts, of, the, outback, the, outback, can, also, be, referred, to, as, back, of, beyond, or, back, o, bourke, although, these, terms, are, more, frequently, used, when, referring, to, something, a, long, way, from, anywhere, or, a, long, way, away, the, well, watered, north, of, the, continent, is, often, called, the, top, end, and, the, arid, interior, the, red, centre, owing, to, its, vast, amounts, of, red, soil, and, sparse, greenery, amongst, its, landscape, the, outback, is, criss, crossed, by, historic, tracks, most, of, the, major, highways, have, an, excellent, bitumen, surface, and, other, major, roads, are, usually, well, maintained, dirt, roads, the, stuart, highway, runs, from, north, to, south, through, the, centre, of, the, continent, roughly, paralleled, by, the, adelaide, darwin, railway, there, is, a, proposal, to, develop, some, of, the, roads, running, from, the, south, west, to, the, north, east, to, create, an, all, weather, road, named, the, outback, highway, crossing, the, continent, diagonally, from, laverton, western, australia, north, of, kalgoorlie, through, the, northern, territory, to, winton, in, queensland, air, transport, is, relied, on, for, mail, delivery, in, some, areas, owing, to, sparse, settlement, and, wet, season, road, closures, most, outback, mines, have, an, airstrip, and, many, have, a, fly, in, fly, out, workforce, most, outback, sheep, stations, and, cattle, stations, have, an, airstrip, and, quite, a, few, have, their, own, light, plane, medical, and, ambulance, services, are, provided, by, the, royal, flying, doctor, service, in, 2024, two, regional, rural, and, remote, air, lines, collapsed, namely, bonza, and, rex
