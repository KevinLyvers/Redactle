ridge, is, an, ancient, ridge, beneath, the, surface, of, lake, huron, running, from, alpena, michigan, southwest, to, point, clark, ontario, about, 9, 000, years, ago, when, water, levels, in, lake, huron, were, approximately, 100, m, 330, ft, below, today, s, levels, the, alpena, amberley, ridge, was, exposed, that, land, bridge, was, used, as, a, migration, route, for, large, herds, of, caribou, since, 2008, archaeologists, have, discovered, at, least, 60, stone, constructions, along, the, submerged, ridge, that, are, thought, to, have, been, used, as, hunting, blinds, by, paleo, indians, that, a, trade, network, brought, obsidian, from, oregon, almost, ten, thousand, years, ago, to, be, used, for, toolmaking, was, confirmed, by, a, 2013, underwater, discovery, along, the, ridge, on, the, eve, of, european, contact, the, extent, of, development, among, eastern, woodlands, native, american, societies, is, indicated, by, the, archaeological, evidence, of, a, town, on, or, near, lake, huron, that, contained, more, than, one, hundred, large, structures, housing, a, total, population, of, between, 4, 000, and, 6, 000, the, french, the, first, european, visitors, to, the, region, often, referred, to, lake, huron, as, la, mer, douce, the, fresh, water, sea, in, 1656, a, map, by, french, cartographer, nicolas, sanson, refers, to, the, lake, by, the, name, karegnondi, a, wyandot, word, that, has, been, translated, variously, as, freshwater, sea, lake, of, the, hurons, or, simply, lake, generally, the, lake, was, labeled, lac, des, hurons, lake, of, the, huron, on, most, early, european, maps, by, the, 1860s, many, european, settlements, on, the, shores, of, lake, huron, were, becoming, incorporated, including, sarnia, the, largest, city, on, lake, huron, on, october, 26, 2010, the, karegnondi, water, authority, was, formed, to, build, and, manage, a, pipeline, from, the, lake, to, flint, michigan, more, than, a, thousand, wrecks, have, been, recorded, in, lake, huron, of, these, 185, are, located, in, saginaw, bay, and, 116, are, found, in, the, 448, square, mile, 1, 160, km, 2, thunder, bay, national, marine, sanctuary, and, underwater, preserve, which, was, established, in, 2000, georgian, bay, contains, 212, sunken, vessels, purportedly, the, first, european, vessel, to, sail, the, great, lakes, le, griffon, also, became, the, first, ship, lost, on, the, great, lakes, it, was, built, in, 1679, on, the, eastern, shore, of, lake, erie, near, buffalo, new, york, robert, cavalier, sieur, de, la, salle, navigated, across, lake, erie, up, the, detroit, river, lake, st, clair, and, the, st, clair, river, out, into, lake, huron, passing, the, straits, of, mackinac, la, salle, made, landfall, on, washington, island, off, the, tip, of, the, door, peninsula, on, the, wisconsin, side, of, lake, michigan, la, salle, filled, le, griffon, with, pelts, and, in, late, november, 1679, sent, le, griffon, back, to, the, site, of, modern, day, buffalo, never, to, be, seen, again, two, wrecks, have, been, identified, as, le, griffon, although, neither, has, gained, final, verification, as, the, actual, wreck, blown, by, a, fierce, storm, after, leaving, le, griffon, ran, aground, before, the, storm, the, people, of, manitoulin, island, say, that, the, wreck, in, mississagi, strait, at, the, western, tip, of, the, island, is, that, of, le, griffon, meanwhile, others, near, tobermory, say, that, the, wreck, on, russell, island, 150, miles, 240, km, farther, east, in, georgian, bay, is, that, of, le, griffon, on, november, 9, 1913, the, great, lakes, storm, of, 1913, in, lake, huron, sank, 10, ships, and, more, than, 20, were, driven, ashore, the, storm, which, raged, for, 16, hours, killed, 235, seamen, matoa, a, propeller, freighter, measuring, 2, 311, gross, register, tons, had, passed, between, port, huron, michigan, and, sarnia, ontario, just, after, midnight, on, november, 9, just, after, six, in, the, morning, senator, pushed, upstream, less, than, an, hour, later, manola, a, propeller, freighter, of, 2, 325, gross, register, tons, also, built, in, cleveland, in, 1890, passed, through, captain, frederick, w, light, of, manola, reported, that, both, the, canadian, and, the, american, weather, stations, had, storm, flag, signals, flying, from, their, weather, towers, following, behind, at, 7, 00, a, m, that, sunday, regina, steamed, out, of, sarnia, into, the, northwest, gale, the, warnings, had, been, up, for, four, hours, manola, passed, regina, off, port, sanilac, 22, statute, miles, 19, nmi, 35, km, up, the, lake, captain, light, determined, that, if, it, continued, to, deteriorate, he, would, seek, shelter, at, harbor, beach, michigan, another, 30, statute, miles, 26, nmi, 48, km, up, the, lake, there, he, could, seek, shelter, behind, the, breakwater, before, he, reached, harbor, beach, the, winds, turned, to, the, northeast, and, the, lake, began, to, rise, it, was, noon, when, he, reached, harbor, beach, and, ran, for, shelter, the, waves, were, so, violent, that, manola, touched, bottom, entering, the, harbor, with, help, from, a, tugboat, manola, tied, up, to, the, break, wall, with, eight, lines, it, was, about, 3, 00, p, m, when, manola, was, secured, and, the, crew, prepared, to, drop, anchor, as, they, worked, the, cables, began, to, snap, from, wind, pressure, against, the, hull, to, keep, from, being, pushed, aground, they, kept, their, bow, into, the, wind, with, the, engines, running, half, to, full, in, turns, yet, the, ship, still, drifted, 800, feet, 240, m, before, its, movement, was, arrested, waves, breaking, over, the, ship, damaged, several, windows, and, the, crew, reported, seeing, portions, of, the, concrete, break, wall, peeling, off, as, the, waves, struck, it, meanwhile, fifty, miles, farther, up, the, lake, matoa, and, captain, hugh, mcleod, had, to, ride, out, the, storm, without, a, safe, harbor, matoa, was, found, stranded, on, the, port, austin, reef, when, the, winds, subsided, it, was, noon, on, monday, before, the, winds, let, up, and, not, until, 11, 00, p, m, that, night, before, captain, light, determined, it, to, be, safe, to, continue, his, journey, although, manola, survived, the, storm, she, was, renamed, mapledawn, in, 1920, and, on, november, 24, 1924, she, became, stranded, on, christian, island, in, georgian, bay, it, was, declared, a, total, loss, salvagers, were, able, to, recover, approximately, 75, 000, bushels, of, barley, lake, huron, has, a, lake, retention, time, of, 22, years, like, all, of, the, great, lakes, the, ecology, of, lake, huron, has, undergone, drastic, changes, in, the, last, century, the, lake, originally, supported, a, native, deepwater, fish, community, dominated, by, lake, trout, which, fed, on, several, species, of, ciscos, as, well, as, sculpins, and, other, native, fishes, several, invasive, species, including, sea, lamprey, alewife, and, rainbow, smelt, became, abundant, in, the, lake, by, the, 1930s, the, major, native, top, predator, lake, trout, was, virtually, extirpated, from, the, lake, by, 1950, through, a, combination, of, overfishing, and, the, effects, of, sea, lamprey, several, species, of, ciscos, were, also, extirpated, from, the, lake, by, the, 1960s, the, only, remaining, native, ciscoes, are, bloater, and, cisco, lake, herring, non, native, pacific, salmon, have, been, stocked, in, the, lake, since, the, 1960s, but, are, less, abundant, since, a, profound, food, web, change, that, took, place, in, 2003, lake, trout, have, also, been, stocked, for, decades, in, an, attempt, to, rehabilitate, the, species, and, today, are, largely, self, sustaining, especially, in, the, northern, half, of, the, lake, lake, huron, has, suffered, recently, by, the, introduction, of, a, variety, of, new, invasive, species, including, zebra, and, quagga, mussels, the, spiny, water, flea, and, round, gobies, the, demersal, fish, community, of, the, lake, was, in, a, state, of, collapse, by, 2006, and, a, number, of, drastic, changes, have, been, observed, in, the, zooplankton, community, of, the, lake, chinook, salmon, catches, have, also, been, greatly, reduced, in, recent, years, and, lake, whitefish, have, become, less, abundant, and, are, in, poor, condition, these, recent, changes, may, be, attributable, to, the, new, exotic, species, some, native, species, however, were, beneficiaries, of, these, chances, principally, a, result, of, the, almost, complete, disappearance, of, the, invasive, alewife, in, the, lake, these, native, species, include, lake, trout, and, walleye, the, walleye, population, in, saginaw, bay, area, of, lake, huron, reached, recovery, targets, in, 2009, michigan, ontario
