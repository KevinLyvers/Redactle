the, western, half, of, sicily, was, ethnically, and, culturally, distinct, from, central, and, eastern, sicily, during, this, time, there, was, also, a, small, jewish, presence, in, sicily, evidence, seen, in, the, catacombs, discovered, on, the, island, palermo, was, initially, ruled, by, the, aghlabids, later, it, was, the, centre, of, the, emirate, of, sicily, which, was, under, the, nominal, suzerainty, of, the, fatimid, caliphate, during, the, reign, of, this, dynasty, revolts, by, byzantine, sicilians, continuously, occurred, especially, in, the, east, where, greek, speaking, christians, predominated, parts, of, the, island, were, re, occupied, before, revolts, were, quashed, under, the, arab, rule, the, island, was, divided, in, three, administrative, regions, or, vals, roughly, corresponding, to, the, three, points, of, sicily, val, di, mazara, in, the, west, val, demone, in, the, northeast, and, val, di, noto, in, the, southeast, as, dhimmis, that, is, as, members, of, a, protected, class, of, approved, monotheists, the, eastern, orthodox, christians, were, allowed, freedom, of, religion, but, had, to, pay, a, tax, the, jizya, in, lieu, of, the, obligatory, alms, tax, the, zakat, paid, by, muslims, and, were, restricted, from, active, participation, in, public, affairs, by, the, 11th, century, the, emirate, of, sicily, began, to, fragment, as, intra, dynastic, quarreling, fractured, the, muslim, government, in, 1038, seventy, years, after, losing, their, last, cities, in, sicily, the, byzantines, under, the, greek, general, george, maniakes, invaded, the, island, together, with, their, varangian, and, norman, mercenaries, maniakes, was, killed, in, a, byzantine, civil, war, in, 1043, before, completing, a, reconquest, and, the, byzantines, withdrew, later, the, normans, invaded, in, 1061, and, after, taking, apulia, and, calabria, roger, i, occupied, messina, with, an, army, of, 700, knights, in, 1068, roger, i, was, victorious, at, misilmeri, most, crucial, was, the, siege, of, palermo, whose, fall, in, 1071, eventually, resulted, in, all, sicily, coming, under, norman, control, the, conquest, was, completed, in, 1091, when, they, captured, noto, the, last, arab, stronghold, palermo, continued, to, be, the, capital, under, the, normans, the, normans, formed, a, small, but, violent, ruling, class, they, destroyed, many, of, the, arab, towns, in, sicily, and, very, few, physical, remains, survive, from, the, arab, era, the, norman, hauteville, family, appreciated, and, admired, the, rich, and, layered, culture, in, which, they, now, found, themselves, they, also, introduced, into, sicily, their, own, culture, customs, and, politics, from, normandy, many, normans, in, sicily, adopted, the, habits, and, comportment, of, muslim, rulers, and, their, byzantine, subjects, in, dress, language, literature, even, to, the, extent, of, having, palace, eunuchs, and, according, to, some, accounts, a, harem, while, roger, i, died, in, 1101, his, wife, adelaide, ruled, until, 1112, when, their, son, roger, ii, of, sicily, came, of, age, having, succeeded, his, brother, simon, as, count, of, sicily, roger, ii, was, ultimately, able, to, raise, the, status, of, the, island, to, a, kingdom, in, 1130, along, with, his, other, holdings, which, included, the, maltese, islands, and, the, duchies, of, apulia, and, calabria, roger, ii, appointed, the, powerful, greek, george, of, antioch, to, be, his, emir, of, emirs, and, continued, the, syncretism, of, his, father, during, this, period, the, kingdom, of, sicily, was, prosperous, and, politically, powerful, becoming, one, of, the, wealthiest, states, in, all, of, europe, even, wealthier, than, the, kingdom, of, england, the, court, of, roger, ii, became, the, most, luminous, centre, of, culture, in, the, mediterranean, both, from, europe, and, the, middle, east, like, the, multi, ethnic, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, then, only, just, eclipsed, this, attracted, scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and, artisans, of, all, kinds, laws, were, issued, in, the, language, of, the, community, to, whom, they, were, addressed, in, norman, sicily, at, the, time, when, the, culture, was, still, heavily, arab, and, greek, governance, was, by, rule, of, law, which, promoted, justice, muslims, jews, byzantine, greeks, lombards, and, normans, worked, together, fairly, amicably, during, this, time, many, extraordinary, buildings, were, constructed, however, this, situation, changed, as, the, normans, imported, immigrants, from, normandy, england, lombardy, piedmont, provence, and, campania, to, secure, the, island, linguistically, the, island, shifted, from, being, one, third, greek, and, two, thirds, arabic, speaking, at, the, time, of, the, norman, conquest, to, becoming, fully, latinised, in, terms, of, religion, the, island, became, completely, roman, catholic, bearing, in, mind, that, until, 1054, the, churches, owing, allegiance, to, the, pope, and, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, belonged, to, one, church, sicily, before, the, norman, conquest, was, under, the, eastern, orthodox, patriarch, after, pope, innocent, iii, made, him, papal, legate, in, 1098, roger, i, created, several, catholic, bishoprics, while, still, allowing, the, construction, of, 12, greek, speaking, monasteries, the, greek, language, monasteries, and, 1500, parishes, continued, to, exist, until, the, adherents, of, the, greek, rite, were, forced, in, 1585, to, convert, to, catholicism, or, leave, a, small, pocket, of, greek, speakers, still, live, in, messina, after, a, century, the, norman, hauteville, dynasty, died, out, the, last, direct, descendant, and, heir, of, roger, ii, constance, married, emperor, henry, vi, this, eventually, led, to, the, crown, of, sicily, being, passed, to, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, who, were, germans, from, swabia, the, last, of, the, hohenstaufens, frederick, ii, the, only, son, of, constance, was, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, cultured, men, of, the, middle, ages, his, mother, s, will, had, asked, pope, innocent, iii, to, undertake, the, guardianship, of, her, son, frederick, was, four, when, at, palermo, he, was, crowned, king, of, sicily, in, 1198, frederick, received, no, systematic, education, and, was, allowed, to, run, free, in, the, streets, of,

innocent, s, deputy, regent, and, took, over, the, government, at, fifteen, he, married, constance, of, aragon, and, began, his, reclamation, of, the, imperial, crown, subsequently, due, to, muslim, rebellions, frederick, ii, destroyed, the, remaining, muslim, presence, in, sicily, estimated, at, 60, 000, people, moving, all, to, the, city, of, lucera, in, apulia, between, 1221, and, 1226, conflict, between, the, hohenstaufen, house, and, the, papacy, led, in, 1266, to, pope, innocent, iv, crowning, the, french, prince, charles, count, of, anjou, and, provence, as, the, king, of, both, sicily, and, naples, strong, opposition, to, french, officialdom, due, to, mistreatment, and, taxation, saw, the, local, peoples, of, sicily, rise, up, leading, in, 1282, to, an, insurrection, known, as, the, war, of, the, sicilian, vespers, which, eventually, saw, almost, the, entire, french, population, on, the, island, killed, during, the, war, the, sicilians, turned, to, peter, iii, of, aragon, son, in, law, of, the, last, hohenstaufen, king, for, support, after, being, rejected, by, the, pope, peter, gained, control, of, sicily, from, the, french, who, however, retained, control, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, a, crusade, was, launched, in, august, 1283, against, peter, iii, and, the, crown, of, aragon, by, pope, martin, iv, a, pope, from, le, de, france, but, it, failed, the, wars, continued, until, the, peace, of, caltabellotta, in, 1302, which, saw, peter, s, son, frederick, iii, recognized, as, the, king, of, the, isle, of, sicily, while, charles, ii, was, recognized, as, the, king, of, naples, by, pope, boniface, viii, sicily, was, ruled, as, an, independent, kingdom, by, relatives, of, the, kings, of, aragon, until, 1409, and, then, as, part, of, the, crown, of, aragon, in, october, 1347, in, messina, sicily, the, black, death, first, arrived, in, europe, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, waves, of, greeks, from, the, peloponnese, such, as, the, maniots, and, arvanites, migrated, to, sicily, in, large, numbers, to, escape, persecution, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, the, peloponnese, they, brought, with, them, eastern, orthodoxy, as, well, as, the, greek, and, arvanitika, languages, once, again, adding, onto, the, extensive, byzantine, greek, influence, the, onset, of, the, spanish, inquisition, in, 1492, led, to, ferdinand, ii, decreeing, the, expulsion, of, all, jews, from, sicily, the, eastern, part, of, the, island, was, hit, by, destructive, earthquakes, in, 1542, and, 1693, just, a, few, years, before, the, latter, earthquake, the, island, was, struck, by, a, plague, the, earthquake, in, 1693, took, an, estimated, 60, 000, lives, there, were, revolts, during, the, 17th, century, but, these, were, quelled, with, force, especially, the, revolts, of, palermo, and, messina, north, african, slave, raids, discouraged, settlement, along, the, coast, until, the, 19th, century, the, treaty, of, utrecht, in, 1713, saw, sicily, assigned, to, the, house, of, savoy, however, this, period, of, rule, lasted, only, seven, years, as, it, was, exchanged, for, the, island, of, sardinia, with, emperor, charles, vi, of, the, austrian, habsburg, dynasty, while, the, austrians, were, concerned, with, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, a, bourbon, prince, charles, from, spain, was, able, to, conquer, sicily, and, naples, at, first, sicily, was, able, to, remain, as, an, independent, kingdom, under, personal, union, while, the, bourbons, ruled, over, both, from, naples, however, the, advent, of, napoleon, s, first, french, empire, saw, naples, taken, at, the, battle, of, campo, tenese, and, bonapartist, king, of, naples, was, installed, ferdinand, iii, the, bourbon, was, forced, to, retreat, to, sicily, which, he, was, still, in, control, of, with, the, help, of, british, naval, protection, following, this, sicily, joined, the, napoleonic, wars, and, subsequently, the, british, under, lord, william, bentinck, established, a, military, and, diplomatic, presence, on, the, island, to, protect, against, a, french, invasion, sicilian, volunteers, joined, the, british, military, to, form, the, royal, sicilian, regiment, which, saw, action, at, the, battle, of, maida, and, then, transferred, to, iberia, after, the, wars, were, won, sicily, and, naples, formally, merged, as, the, two, sicilies, under, the, bourbons, major, revolutionary, movements, occurred, in, 1820, and, 1848, against, the, bourbon, government, with, sicily, seeking, independence, the, second, of, which, the, 1848, revolution, resulted, in, a, short, period, of, independence, for, sicily, however, in, 1849, the, bourbons, retook, control, of, the, island, and, dominated, it, until, 1860, the, expedition, of, the, thousand, led, by, giuseppe, garibaldi, captured, sicily, in, 1860, as, part, of, the, risorgimento, the, conquest, started, at, marsala, and, native, sicilians, joined, him, in, the, capture, of, the, southern, italian, peninsula, garibaldi, s, march, was, completed, with, the, siege, of, gaeta, where, the, final, bourbons, were, expelled, and, garibaldi, announced, his, dictatorship, in, the, name, of, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, kingdom, of, sardinia, sicily, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, after, a, referendum, in, which, more, than, 75, of, sicily, voted, in, favour, of, the, annexation, on, 21, october, 1860, although, not, everyone, was, allowed, to, vote, as, a, result, of, the, proclamation, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, sicily, became, part, of, the, kingdom, on, 17, march, 1861, the, sicilian, economy, and, the, wider, mezzogiorno, economy, remained, relatively, underdeveloped, after, the, italian, unification, in, spite, of, the, strong, investments, made, by, the, kingdom, of, italy, in, terms, of, modern, infrastructure, and, this, caused, an, unprecedented, wave, of, emigration, in, 1894, organisations, of, workers, and, peasants, known, as, the, fasci, siciliani, protested, against, the, bad, social, and, economic, conditions, of, the, island, but, they, were, suppressed, in, a, few, days, the, messina, earthquake, of, 28, december, 1908, killed, more, than, 80, 000, people, this, period, was, also, characterized, by, the, first, contact, between, the, sicilian, mafia, the, crime, syndicate, also, known, as, cosa, nostra, and, the, italian, government, the, mafia, s, origins, are, still, uncertain, but, it, is, generally, accepted, that, it, emerged, in, the, 18th, century, initially, in, the, role, of, private, enforcers, hired, to, protect, the, property, of, landowners, and, merchants, from, the, groups, of, brigands, briganti, who, frequently, pillaged, the, countryside, and, towns, the, battle, against, the, mafia, made, by, the, kingdom, of, italy, was, controversial, and, ambiguous, the, carabinieri, the, military, police, of, italy, and, sometimes, the, italian, army, were, often, involved, in, fights, against, the, mafia, members, but, their, efforts, were, frequently, useless, because, of, the, secret, cooperation, between, the, mafia, and, local, government, and, also, because, of, the, weakness, of, the, italian, judicial, system, in, the, 1920s, the, fascist, regime, began, a, stronger, military, action, against, the, mafia, which, was, led, by, prefect, cesare, mori, who, was, known, as, the, iron, prefect, because, of, his, iron, fisted, campaigns, this, was, the, first, time, in, which, an, operation, against, the, sicilian, mafia, ended, with, considerable, success, there, was, an, allied, invasion, of, sicily, during, world, war, ii, starting, on, 10, july, 1943, in, preparation, for, the, invasion, the, allies, revitalised, the, mafia, to, aid, them, the, invasion, of, sicily, contributed, to, the, 25, july, crisis, in, general, the, allied, victors, were, warmly, embraced, by, sicily, italy, became, a, republic, in, 1946, and, as, part, of, the, constitution, of, italy, sicily, was, one, of, the, five, regions, given, special, status, as, an, autonomous, region, both, the, partial, italian, land, reform, and, special, funding, from, the, italian, government, s, cassa, per, il, mezzogiorno, fund, for, the, south, from, 1950, to, 1984, helped, the, sicilian, economy, during, this, period, the, economic, and, social, condition, of, the, island, was, generally, improved, due, to, investments, in, infrastructure, such, as, motorways, and, airports, and, thanks, to, the, creation, of, industrial, and, commercial, areas, in, the, 1980s, the, mafia, was, weakened, by, another, campaign, led, by, magistrates, giovanni, falcone, and, paolo, borsellino, between, 1990, and, 2005, the, unemployment, rate, fell, from, about, 23, to, 11, the, cosa, nostra, has, traditionally, been, the, most, powerful, group, in, sicily, especially, around, palermo, a, police, investigation, in, summer, 2019, also, confirmed, strong, links, between, the, palermo, area, sicilian, mafia, and, american, organized, crime, particularly, the, gambino, crime, family, according, to, la, repubblica, off, they, go, through, the, streets, of, passo, di, rigano, boccadifalco, torretta, and, at, the, same, time, brooklyn, staten, island, new, jersey, because, from, sicily, to, the, us, the, old, mafia, has, returned, as, of, 2024, 4, 75, million, people, live, in, sicily, making, it, the, fourth, most, populated, region, in, italy, in, the, first, century, after, the, italian, unification, sicily, had, one, of, the, most, negative, net, migration, rates, among, the, regions, of, italy, because, of, the, emigration, of, millions, of, people, to, northern, italy, other, european, countries, north, america, south, america, and, australia, like, the, south, of, italy, and, sardinia, immigration, to, the, island, is, very, low, compared, to, other, regions, of, italy, because, workers, tend, to, head, to, northern, italy, instead, due, to, better, employment, and, industrial, opportunities, according, to, istat, figures, from, 2017, show, around, 175, 000, immigrants, out, of, the, total, 5, 029, 615, population, romanians, with, more, than, 50, 000, make, up, the, most, immigrants, followed, by, tunisians, moroccans, sri, lankans, albanians, and, others, mostly, from, eastern, europe, as, of, 31, december, 2020, there, were, 186, 195, foreigners, resident, in, the, region, as, in, the, rest, of, italy, the, official, language, is, italian, and, the, primary, religion, is, roman, catholicism, sicilian, emigration, started, shortly, after, the, italian, unification, and, has, not, stopped, ever, since, after, the, italian, unification, sicily, along, with, the, entire, italian, peninsula, has, also, been, strongly, marked, by, economic, emigration, most, of, the, assets, of, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, s, former, national, bank, banco, delle, due, sicilie, were, transferred, to, piedmont, during, the, first, decades, of, c, a, rising, number, of, southern, italian, manufactories, were, driven, into, ruin, due, to, high, taxation, imposed, by, the, central, government, the, aforementioned, factors, along, with, a, failed, land, reform, resulted, in, a, never, before, seen, wave, of, sicilians, emigrating, first, to, the, united, states, between, the, 1880s, and, the, 1920s, later, to, northern, italy, and, from, the, 1960s, onwards, also, to, belgium, france, germany, switzerland, as, well, as, australia, and, south, america, today, sicily, is, the, italian, region, with, the, highest, number, of, expatriates, as, of, 2017, 750, 000, sicilians, 14, 4, of, the, island, s, population, lived, abroad, for, lack, of, employment, every, year, many, sicilians, especially, young, graduates, still, leave, the, island, to, seek, jobs, abroad, today, an, estimated, 10, million, people, of, sicilian, origins, live, around, the, world, these, are, the, ten, largest, cities, of, sicily, as, in, most, italian, regions, roman, catholicism, is, the, predominant, religious, denomination, in, sicily, and, the, church, still, plays, an, important, role, in, the, lives, of, most, people, there, is, also, a, notable, small, minority, of, eastern, rite, byzantine, catholics, which, has, a, mixed, congregation, of, ethnic, albanians, it, is, operated, by, the, italo, albanian, catholic, church, most, people, still, attend, church, weekly, or, at, least, for, religious, festivals, and, many, people, get, married, in, churches, there, was, a, wide, presence, of, jews, in, sicily, for, at, least, 1, 400, years, and, possibly, for, more, than, 2, 000, years, some, scholars, believe, that, the, sicilian, jewry, are, partial, ancestors, of, the, ashkenazi, jews, however, much, of, the, jewish, community, faded, away, when, they, were, expelled, from, the, island, in, 1492, islam, was, present, during, the, emirate, of, sicily, although, muslims, were, also, expelled, today, mostly, due, to, immigration, to, the, island, there, are, also, several, religious, minorities, such, as, jehovah, s, witnesses, hinduism, islam, judaism, and, sikhism, there, are, also, a, some, evangelical, christians, who, live,
