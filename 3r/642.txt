the, tropics, are, the, regions, of, earth, surrounding, the, equator, they, are, defined, in, latitude, by, the, tropic, of, cancer, in, the, northern, hemisphere, at, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, n, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, in, the, southern, hemisphere, at, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, s, the, tropics, are, also, referred, to, as, the, tropical, zone, and, the, torrid, zone, see, geographical, zone, in, terms, of, climate, the, tropics, receive, sunlight, that, is, more, direct, than, the, rest, of, earth, and, are, generally, hotter, and, wetter, as, they, are, not, affected, as, much, by, the, solar, seasons, the, word, tropical, sometimes, refers, to, this, sort, of, climate, in, the, zone, rather, than, to, the, geographical, zone, itself, the, tropical, zone, includes, deserts, and, snow, capped, mountains, which, are, not, tropical, in, the, climatic, sense, the, tropics, are, distinguished, from, the, other, climatic, and, biomatic, regions, of, earth, which, are, the, middle, latitudes, and, the, polar, regions, on, either, side, of, the, equatorial, zone, the, tropics, constitute, 39, 8, of, earth, s, surface, area, and, contain, 36, of, earth, s, landmass, as, of, 2014, the, region, was, home, also, to, 40, of, the, world, s, population, and, this, figure, was, then, projected, to, reach, 50, by, 2050, because, of, global, warming, the, weather, conditions, of, the, tropics, are, expanding, with, areas, in, the, subtropics, having, more, extreme, weather, events, such, as, heatwaves, and, more, intense, storms, these, changes, in, weather, conditions, may, make, certain, parts, of, the, tropics, uninhabitable, the, word, tropic, comes, via, latin, from, ancient, greek, trop, meaning, to, turn, or, change, direction, the, tropics, are, defined, as, the, region, between, the, tropic, of, cancer, in, the, northern, hemisphere, at, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, n, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, in, the, southern, hemisphere, at, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, s, these, latitudes, correspond, to, the, axial, tilt, of, the, earth, the, tropic, of, cancer, is, the, northernmost, latitude, from, which, the, sun, can, ever, be, seen, directly, overhead, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, the, southernmost, this, means, that, the, tropical, zone, includes, everywhere, on, earth, which, is, a, subsolar, point, at, least, once, during, the, solar, year, thus, the, maximum, latitudes, of, the, tropics, have, equal, distances, from, the, equator, on, either, side, likewise, they, approximate, the, angle, of, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, this, angle, is, not, perfectly, fixed, mainly, due, to, the, influence, of, the, moon, but, the, limits, of, the, tropics, are, a, geographic, convention, and, their, variance, from, the, true, latitudes, is, very, small, many, tropical, areas, have, both, a, dry, and, a, wet, season, the, wet, season, rainy, season, or, green, season, is, the, time, of, year, ranging, from, one, or, more, months, when, most, of, the, average, annual, rainfall, in, a, region, falls, areas, with, wet, seasons, are, disseminated, across, portions, of, the, tropics, and, subtropics, some, even, in, temperate, regions, under, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, for, tropical, climates, a, wet, season, month, is, defined, as, one, or, more, months, where, average, precipitation, is, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, or, more, some, areas, with, pronounced, rainy, seasons, see, a, break, in, rainfall, during, mid, season, when, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, or, monsoon, trough, moves, poleward, of, their, location, during, the, middle, of, the, warm, season, typical, vegetation, in, these, areas, ranges, from, moist, seasonal, tropical, forests, to, savannahs, when, the, wet, season, occurs, during, the, warm, season, or, summer, precipitation, falls, mainly, during, the, late, afternoon, and, early, evening, hours, the, wet, season, is, a, time, when, air, quality, improves, freshwater, quality, improves, and, vegetation, grows, significantly, due, to, the, wet, season, supplementing, flora, leading, to, crop, yields, late, in, the, season, floods, and, rains, cause, rivers, to, overflow, their, banks, and, some, animals, to, retreat, to, higher, ground, soil, nutrients, are, washed, away, and, erosion, increases, the, incidence, of, malaria, increases, in, areas, where, the, rainy, season, coincides, with, high, temperatures, animals, have, adaptation, and, survival, strategies, for, the, wetter, regime, the, previous, dry, season, leads, to, food, shortages, into, the, wet, season, as, the, crops, have, yet, to, mature, however, regions, within, the, tropics, may, well, not, have, a, tropical, climate, under, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, much, of, the, area, within, the, geographical, tropics, is, classed, not, as, tropical, but, as, dry, arid, or, semi, arid, including, the, sahara, desert, the, atacama, desert, and, australian, outback, also, there, are, alpine, tundra, and, snow, capped, peaks, including, mauna, kea, mount, kilimanjaro, puncak, jaya, and, the, andes, as, far, south, as, the, northernmost, parts, of, chile, and, per, the, climate, is, changing, in, the, tropics, as, it, is, in, the, rest, of, the, world, the, effects, of, steadily, rising, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, on, the, climate, may, be, less, obvious, to, tropical, residents, however, because, they, are, overlain, by, considerable, natural, variability, much, of, this, variability, is, driven, by, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, the, tropics, has, warmed, by, 0, 7, 0, 8, c, over, the, last, century, only, slightly, less, than, the, global, average, but, a, strong, el, ni, o, made, 1998, the, warmest, year, in, most, areas, with, no, significant, warming, since, climate, models, predict, a, further, 1, 2, c, warming, by, 2050, and, 1, 4, c, by, 2100, tropical, plants, and, animals, are, those, species, native, to, the, tropics, tropical, ecosystems, may, consist, of, tropical, rainforests, seasonal, tropical, forests, dry, often, deciduous, forests, spiny, forests, deserts, savannahs, grasslands, and, other, habitat, types, there, are, often, wide, areas, of, biodiversity, and, species, endemism, present, particularly, in, rainforests, and, seasonal, forests, some, examples, of, important, biodiversity, and, high, endemism, ecosystems, are, el, yunque, national, forest, in, puerto, rico, costa, rican, and, nicaraguan, rainforests, amazon, rainforest, territories, of, several, south, american, countries, madagascar, dry, deciduous, forests, the, waterberg, biosphere, of, south, africa, and, eastern, madagascar, rainforests, often, the, soils, of, tropical, forests, are, low, in, nutrient, content, making, them, quite, vulnerable, to, slash, and, burn, deforestation, techniques, which, are, sometimes, an, element, of, shifting, cultivation, agricultural, systems, in, biogeography, the, tropics, are, divided, into, paleotropics, africa, asia, and, australia, and, neotropics, caribbean, central, america, and, south, america, together, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pantropic, the, system, of, biogeographic, realms, differs, somewhat, the, neotropical, realm, includes, both, the, neotropics, and, temperate, south, america, and, the, paleotropics, correspond, to, the, afrotropical, indomalayan, oceanian, and, tropical, australasian, realms, flora, are, plants, found, in, a, specific, region, at, a, specific, time, some, well, known, plants, that, are, exclusively, found, in, originate, from, or, are, often, associated, with, the, tropics, include, tropicality, refers, to, the, image, of, the, tropics, that, people, from, outside, the, tropics, have, of, the, region, ranging, from, critical, to, verging, on, fetishism, tropicality, gained, renewed, interest, in, geographical, discourse, when, french, geographer, pierre, gourou, published, les, pays, tropicaux, the, tropical, world, in, english, in, the, late, 1940s, tropicality, encompassed, two, major, images, one, is, that, the, tropics, represent, a, garden, of, eden, a, heaven, on, earth, a, land, of, rich, biodiversity, or, a, tropical, paradise, the, alternative, is, that, the, tropics, consist, of, wild, unconquerable, nature, the, latter, view, was, often, discussed, in, old, western, literature, more, so, than, the, first, evidence, suggests, over, time, that, the, view, of, the, tropics, as, such, in, popular, literature, has, been, supplanted, by, more, well, rounded, and, sophisticated, interpretations, western, scholars, tried, to, theorise, why, tropical, areas, were, relatively, more, inhospitable, to, human, civilisations, than, colder, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, a, popular, explanation, focused, on, the, differences, in, climate, tropical, jungles, and, rainforests, have, much, more, humid, and, hotter, weather, than, colder, and, drier, temperaments, of, the, northern, hemisphere, giving, to, a, more, diverse, biosphere, this, theme, led, some, scholars, to, suggest, that, humid, hot, climates, correlate, to, human, populations, lacking, control, over, nature, e, g, the, wild, amazonian, rainforests
