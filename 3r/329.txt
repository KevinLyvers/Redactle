the, rocky, mountains, also, known, as, the, rockies, are, a, major, mountain, range, and, the, largest, mountain, system, in, north, america, the, rocky, mountains, stretch, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, kilometers, in, straight, line, distance, from, the, northernmost, part, of, western, canada, to, new, mexico, in, the, southwestern, united, states, depending, on, differing, definitions, between, canada, and, the, u, s, its, northern, terminus, is, located, either, in, northern, british, columbia, s, terminal, range, south, of, the, liard, river, and, east, of, the, trench, or, in, the, northeastern, foothills, of, the, brooks, range, british, mountains, that, face, the, beaufort, sea, coasts, between, the, canning, river, and, the, firth, river, across, the, alaska, yukon, border, its, southernmost, point, is, near, the, albuquerque, area, adjacent, to, the, rio, grande, rift, and, north, of, the, sandia, manzano, mountain, range, being, the, easternmost, portion, of, the, north, american, cordillera, the, rockies, are, distinct, from, the, tectonically, younger, cascade, range, and, sierra, nevada, which, both, lie, farther, to, its, west, the, rockies, formed, 55, million, to, 80, million, years, ago, during, the, laramide, orogeny, in, which, a, number, of, plates, began, sliding, underneath, the, north, american, plate, the, angle, of, subduction, was, shallow, resulting, in, a, broad, belt, of, mountains, running, down, western, north, america, since, then, further, tectonic, activity, and, erosion, by, glaciers, have, sculpted, the, rockies, into, dramatic, peaks, and, valleys, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, humans, began, inhabiting, the, mountain, range, after, explorations, of, the, range, by, europeans, such, as, sir, alexander, mackenzie, and, anglo, americans, such, as, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, natural, resources, such, as, minerals, and, fur, drove, the, initial, economic, exploitation, of, the, mountains, although, the, range, itself, never, experienced, a, dense, population, most, of, the, highest, summits, of, the, rocky, mountains, are, in, colorado, with, that, state, having, an, average, elevation, in, excess, of, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, public, parks, and, forest, lands, protect, much, of, the, mountain, range, and, they, are, popular, tourist, destinations, especially, for, hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain, biking, snowmobiling, skiing, and, snowboarding, the, name, of, the, mountains, is, a, calque, of, an, algonquian, name, specifically, cree, asin, wati, originally, transcribed, as, sin, wati, literally, rocky, mountain, the, first, mention, of, their, present, name, by, a, european, was, in, the, journal, of, jacques, legardeur, de, saint, pierre, in, 1752, where, they, were, called, montagnes, de, roche, another, name, given, to, the, place, by, the, cree, is, aseniwuche, the, rocky, mountains, are, the, easternmost, portion, of, the, expansive, north, american, cordillera, they, are, often, defined, as, stretching, from, the, liard, river, in, british, columbia, 13, south, to, the, headwaters, of, the, pecos, river, a, tributary, of, the, rio, grande, in, new, mexico, the, rockies, vary, in, width, from, 110, to, 480, kilometres, 70, to, 300, miles, the, rocky, mountains, contain, the, highest, peaks, in, central, north, america, the, range, s, highest, peak, is, mount, elbert, in, colorado, at, 4, 401, metres, 14, 440, feet, above, sea, level, mount, robson, in, british, columbia, at, 3, 954, m, 12, 972, ft, is, the, highest, peak, in, the, canadian, rockies, the, eastern, edge, of, the, rockies, rises, dramatically, above, the, interior, plains, of, central, north, america, including, the, sangre, de, cristo, mountains, of, new, mexico, and, colorado, the, front, range, of, colorado, the, wind, river, range, and, big, horn, mountains, of, wyoming, the, absaroka, beartooth, ranges, and, rocky, mountain, front, of, montana, and, the, clark, range, of, alberta, central, ranges, of, the, rockies, include, the, la, sal, range, along, the, utah, colorado, border, the, abajo, mountains, and, henry, mountains, of, southeastern, utah, the, uinta, range, of, utah, and, wyoming, and, the, teton, range, of, wyoming, and, idaho, the, western, edge, of, the, rockies, includes, ranges, such, as, the, wasatch, near, salt, lake, city, the, san, juan, mountains, of, new, mexico, and, colorado, the, bitterroots, along, the, idaho, montana, border, and, the, sawtooths, in, central, idaho, the, great, basin, and, columbia, river, plateau, separate, these, subranges, from, distinct, ranges, further, to, the, west, in, canada, the, western, edge, of, the, rockies, is, formed, by, the, huge, rocky, mountain, trench, which, runs, the, length, of, british, columbia, from, its, beginning, as, the, kechika, valley, on, the, south, bank, of, the, liard, river, to, the, middle, lake, koocanusa, valley, in, northwestern, montana, the, canadian, rockies, are, defined, by, canadian, geographers, as, everything, south, of, the, liard, river, and, east, of, the, rocky, mountain, trench, and, do, not, extend, into, yukon, northwest, territories, or, central, british, columbia, they, are, divided, into, three, main, groups, the, muskwa, ranges, hart, ranges, collectively, called, the, northern, rockies, and, continental, ranges, other, more, northerly, mountain, ranges, of, the, eastern, canadian, cordillera, continue, beyond, the, liard, river, valley, including, the, selwyn, mackenzie, and, richardson, mountains, in, yukon, as, well, as, the, british, mountains, brooks, range, in, alaska, but, those, are, not, officially, recognized, as, part, of, the, rockies, by, the, geological, survey, of, canada, although, the, geological, society, of, america, definition, does, consider, them, parts, of, the, rocky, mountains, system, as, the, arctic, rockies, the, continental, divide, of, the, americas, is, in, the, rocky, mountains, and, designates, the, line, at, which, waters, flow, either, to, the, atlantic, or, pacific, oceans, triple, divide, peak, 2, 440, m, or, 8, 020, ft, in, glacier, national, park, is, so, named, because, water, falling, on, the, mountain, reaches, not, only, the, atlantic, and, pacific, but, hudson, bay, as, well, farther, north, in, alberta, the, athabasca, and, other, rivers, feed, the, basin, of, the, mackenzie, river, which, has, its, outlet, on, the, beaufort, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, human, population, is, not, very, dense, in, the, rockies, with, an, average, of, four, people, per, square, kilometer, and, few, cities, with, over, 50, 000, people, however, the, human, population, grew, rapidly, in, the, rocky, mountain, states, between, 1950, and, 1990, the, forty, year, statewide, increases, in, population, range, from, 35, in, montana, to, about, 150, in, utah, and, colorado, the, populations, of, several, mountain, towns, and, communities, have, doubled, in, the, forty, years, 1972, 2012, jackson, wyoming, increased, 260, from, 1, 244, to, 4, 472, residents, in, those, forty, years, the, rocks, in, the, rocky, mountains, were, formed, before, the, mountains, were, raised, by, tectonic, forces, the, oldest, rock, is, precambrian, metamorphic, rock, that, forms, the, core, of, the, north, american, continent, there, is, also, precambrian, sedimentary, argillite, dating, back, to, 1, 7, billion, years, ago, during, the, paleozoic, western, north, america, lay, underneath, a, shallow, sea, which, deposited, many, kilometers, of, limestone, and, dolomite, 76, in, the, southern, rockies, near, present, day, colorado, these, ancestral, rocks, were, disturbed, by, mountain, building, approximately, 300, ma, during, the, pennsylvanian, this, mountain, building, produced, the, ancestral, rocky, mountains, they, consisted, largely, of, precambrian, metamorphic, rock, forced, upward, through, layers, of, the, limestone, laid, down, in, the, shallow, sea, the, mountains, eroded, throughout, the, late, paleozoic, and, early, mesozoic, leaving, extensive, deposits, of, sedimentary, rock, terranes, began, colliding, with, the, western, edge, of, north, america, in, the, mississippian, approximately, 350, million, years, ago, causing, the, antler, orogeny, for, 270, million, years, the, focus, of, the, effects, of, plate, collisions, were, near, the, edge, of, the, north, american, plate, boundary, far, to, the, west, of, the, rocky, mountain, region, it, was, not, until, 80, ma, that, these, effects, began, reaching, the, rockies, the, current, rocky, mountains, arose, in, the, laramide, orogeny, from, between, 80, and, 55, ma, for, the, canadian, rockies, the, mountain, building, is, analogous, to, pushing, a, rug, on, a, hardwood, floor, 78, the, rug, bunches, up, and, forms, wrinkles, mountains, in, canada, the, terranes, and, subduction, are, the, foot, pushing, the, rug, the, ancestral, rocks, are, the, rug, and, the, canadian, shield, in, the, middle, of, the, continent, is, the, hardwood, floor, 78, further, south, an, unusual, subduction, may, have, caused, the, growth, of, the, rocky, mountains, in, the, united, states, where, the, farallon, plate, dove, at, a, shallow, angle, below, the, north, american, plate, this, low, angle, moved, the, focus, of, melting, and, mountain, building, much, farther, inland, than, the, normal, 300, to, 500, kilometres, 200, to, 300, mi, scientists, hypothesize, that, the, shallow, angle, of, the, subducting, plate, increased, the, friction, and, other, interactions, with, the, thick, continental, mass, above, it, tremendous, thrusts, piled, sheets, of, crust, on, top, of, each, other, building, the, broad, high, rocky, mountain, range, the, current, southern, rockies, were, forced, upwards, through, the, layers, of, pennsylvanian, and, permian, sedimentary, remnants, of, the, ancestral, rocky, mountains, such, sedimentary, remnants, were, often, tilted, at, steep, angles, along, the, flanks, of, the, modern, range, they, are, now, visible, in, many, places, throughout, the, rockies, and, are, shown, along, the, dakota, hogback, an, early, cretaceous, sandstone, formation, running, along, the, eastern, flank, of, the, modern, rockies, just, after, the, laramide, orogeny, the, rockies, were, like, tibet, a, high, plateau, probably, 6, 000, metres, 20, 000, ft, above, sea, level, in, the, last, sixty, million, years, erosion, stripped, away, the, high, rocks, revealing, the, ancestral, rocks, beneath, and, forming, the, current, landscape, of, the, rockies, 80, 81, periods, of, glaciation, occurred, from, the, pleistocene, epoch, 1, 8, million, 70, 000, years, ago, to, the, holocene, epoch, fewer, than, 11, 000, years, ago, these, ice, ages, left, their, mark, on, the, rockies, forming, extensive, glacial, landforms, such, as, u, shaped, valleys, and, cirques, recent, glacial, episodes, included, the, bull, lake, glaciation, which, began, about, 150, 000, years, ago, and, the, pinedale, glaciation, which, perhaps, remained, at, full, glaciation, until, 15, 000, 20, 000, years, ago, all, of, these, geological, processes, exposed, a, complex, set, of, rocks, at, the, surface, for, example, volcanic, rock, from, the, paleogene, and, neogene, periods, 66, million, 2, 6, million, years, ago, occurs, in, the, san, juan, mountains, and, in, other, areas, millennia, of, severe, erosion, in, the, wyoming, basin, transformed, intermountain, basins, into, a, relatively, flat, terrain, the, tetons, and, other, north, central, ranges, contain, folded, and, faulted, rocks, of, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, age, draped, above, cores, of, proterozoic, and, archean, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, ranging, in, age, from, 1, 2, billion, e, g, tetons, to, more, than, 3, 3, billion, years, beartooth, mountains, there, are, a, wide, range, of, environmental, factors, in, the, rocky, mountains, the, rockies, range, in, latitude, between, the, liard, river, in, british, columbia, at, 59, n, and, the, rio, grande, in, new, mexico, at, 35, n, prairie, occurs, at, or, below, 550, metres, 1, 800, ft, while, the, highest, peak, in, the, range, is, mount, elbert, at, 4, 400, metres, 14, 440, ft, precipitation, ranges, from, 250, millimetres, 10, in, per, year, in, the, southern, valleys, to, 1, 500, millimetres, 60, in, per, year, locally, in, the, northern, peaks, average, january, temperatures, can, range, from, 7, c, 20, f, in, prince, george, british, columbia, to, 6, c, 43, f, in, trinidad, colorado, therefore, there, is, no, single, monolithic, ecosystem, for, the, entire, rocky, mountain, range, instead, ecologists, divide, the, rockies, into, a, number, of, biotic, zones, each, zone, is, defined, by, whether, it, can, support, trees, and, the, presence, of, one, or, more, indicator, species, two, zones, that, do, not, support, trees, are, the, plains, and, the, alpine, tundra, the, great, plains, lie, to, the, east, of, the, rockies, and, is, characterized, by, prairie, grasses, below, roughly, 550, m, or, 1, 800, ft, alpine, tundra, occurs, in, regions, above, the, tree, line, for, the, rocky, mountains, which, varies, from, 3, 700, m, 12, 000, ft, in, new, mexico, to, 760, m, 2, 500, ft, at, the, northern, end, of, the, rockies, near, the, yukon, the, u, s, geological, survey, defines, ten, forested, zones, in, the, rockies, zones, in, more, southern, warmer, or, drier, areas, are, defined, by, the, presence, of, pinyon, pines, junipers, ponderosa, pines, or, oaks, mixed, with, pines, in, more, northern, colder, or, wetter, areas, zones, are, defined, by, douglas, firs, cascadian, species, such, as, western, hemlock, lodgepole, pines, quaking, aspens, or, firs, mixed, with, spruce, near, tree, line, zones, can, consist, of, white, pines, such, as, whitebark, pine, or, bristlecone, pine, or, a, mixture, of, white, pine, fir, and, spruce, that, appear, as, shrub, like, krummholz, finally, rivers, and, canyons, can, create, a, unique, forest, zone, in, more, arid, parts, of, the, mountain, range, the, rocky, mountains, are, an, important, habitat, for, a, great, deal, of, well, known, wildlife, such, as, wolves, elk, moose, mule, and, white, tailed, deer, pronghorn, mountain, goats, bighorn, sheep, badgers, black, bears, grizzly, bears, coyotes, lynxes, cougars, and, wolverines, north, america, s, largest, herds, of, elk, are, in, the, alberta, british, columbia, foothills, forests, the, status, of, most, species, in, the, rocky, mountains, is, unknown, due, to, incomplete, information, european, american, settlement, of, the, mountains, has, adversely, impacted, native, species, examples, of, some, species, that, have, declined, include, western, toads, greenback, cutthroat, trout, white, sturgeon, white, tailed, ptarmigan, trumpeter, swan, and, bighorn, sheep, in, the, u, s, portion, of, the, mountain, range, apex, predators, such, as, grizzly, bears, and, wolf, packs, had, been, extirpated, from, their, original, ranges, but, have, partially, recovered, due, to, conservation, measures, and, reintroduction, other, recovering, species, include, the, bald, eagle, and, the, peregrine, falcon, since, the, last, great, ice, age, the, rocky, mountains, were, home, first, to, indigenous, peoples, including, the, apache, arapaho, bannock, blackfoot, cheyenne, coeur, d, alene, kalispel, crow, nation, flathead, shoshone, sioux, ute, kutenai, ktunaxa, in, canada, sekani, dunne, za, and, others, paleo, indians, hunted, the, now, extinct, mammoth, and, ancient, bison, an, animal, 20, larger, than, modern, bison, in, the, foothills, and, valleys, of, the, mountains, like, the, modern, tribes, that, followed, them, paleo, indians, probably, migrated, to, the, plains, in, fall, and, winter, for, bison, and, to, the, mountains, in, spring, and, summer, for, fish, deer, elk, roots, and, berries, in, colorado, along, with, the, crest, of, the, continental, divide, rock, walls, that, native, americans, built, for, driving, game, date, back, 5, 400, 5, 800, years, a, growing, body, of, scientific, evidence, indicates, that, indigenous, people, had, significant, effects, on, mammal, populations, by, hunting, and, on, vegetation, patterns, through, deliberate, burning, recent, human, history, of, the, rocky, mountains, is, one, of, more, rapid, change, the, spanish, explorer, francisco, v, zquez, de, coronado, with, a, group, of, soldiers, and, missionaries, marched, into, the, rocky, mountain, region, from, the, south, in, 1540, in, 1610, the, spanish, founded, the, city, of, santa, fe, the, oldest, continuous, seat, of, government, in, the, united, states, at, the, foot, of, the, rockies, in, present, day, new, mexico, the, introduction, of, the, horse, metal, tools, rifles, new, diseases, and, different, cultures, profoundly, changed, the, native, american, cultures, native, american, populations, were, extirpated, from, most, of, their, historical, ranges, by, disease, warfare, habitat, loss, eradication, of, the, bison, and, continued, assaults, on, their, culture, in, 1739, french, fur, traders, pierre, and, paul, mallet, while, journeying, through, the, great, plains, discovered, a, range, of, mountains, at, the, headwaters, of, the, platte, river, which, local, american, indian, tribes, called, the, rockies, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, report, on, this, uncharted, mountain, range, sir, alexander, mackenzie, 1764, march, 11, 1820, became, the, first, european, to, cross, the, rocky, mountains, in, 1793, he, found, the, upper, reaches, of, the, fraser, river, and, reached, the, pacific, coast, of, what, is, now, canada, on, july, 20, of, that, year, completing, the, first, recorded, transcontinental, crossing, of, north, america, north, of, mexico, he, arrived, at, bella, coola, british, columbia, where, he, first, reached, saltwater, at, south, bentinck, arm, an, inlet, of, the, pacific, ocean, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, 1804, 1806, was, the, first, scientific, reconnaissance, of, the, rocky, mountains, specimens, were, collected, for, contemporary, botanists, zoologists, and, geologists, the, expedition, was, said, to, have, paved, the, way, to, and, through, the, rocky, mountains, for, european, americans, from, the, east, although, lewis, and, clark, met, at, least, 11, european, american, mountain, men, during, their, travels, mountain, men, primarily, french, spanish, and, british, roamed, the, rocky, mountains, from, 1720, to, 1800, seeking, mineral, deposits, and, furs, the, fur, trading, north, west, company, established, rocky, mountain, house, as, a, trading, post, in, what, is, now, the, rocky, mountain, foothills, of, present, day, alberta, in, 1799, and, their, business, rivals, the, hudson, s, bay, company, established, acton, house, nearby, these, posts, served, as, bases, for, most, european, activity, in, the, canadian, rockies, in, the, early, 19th, century, among, the, most, notable, are, the, expeditions, of, david, thompson, who, followed, the, columbia, river, to, the, pacific, ocean, on, his, 1811, expedition, he, camped, at, the, junction, of, the, columbia, river, and, the, snake, river, and, erected, a, pole, and, notice, claiming, the, area, for, the, united, kingdom, and, stating, the, intention, of, the, north, west, company, to, build, a, fort, at, the, site, by, the, anglo, american, convention, of, 1818, which, established, the, 49th, parallel, north, as, the, international, boundary, west, from, lake, of, the, woods, to, the, stony, mountains, the, uk, and, the, us, agreed, to, what, has, since, been, described, as, joint, occupancy, of, lands, further, west, to, the, pacific, ocean, resolution, of, the, territorial, and, treaty, issues, the, oregon, dispute, was, deferred, until, a, later, time, in, 1819, spain, ceded, their, rights, north, of, the, 42nd, parallel, to, the, united, states, though, these, rights, did, not, include, possession, and, also, included, obligations, to, britain, and, russia, concerning, their, claims, in, the, same, region, after, 1802, fur, traders, and, explorers, ushered, in, the, first, widespread, american, presence, in, the, rockies, south, of, the, 49th, parallel, the, more, famous, of, these, include, william, henry, ashley, jim, bridger, kit, carson, john, colter, thomas, fitzpatrick, andrew, henry, and, jedediah, smith, on, july, 24, 1832, benjamin, bonneville, led, the, first, wagon, train, across, the, rocky, mountains, by, using, south, pass, in, the, present, state, of, wyoming, similarly, in, the, wake, of, mackenzie, s, 1793, expedition, fur, trading, posts, were, established, west, of, the, northern, rockies, in, a, region, of, the, northern, interior, plateau, of, british, columbia, which, came, to, be, known, as, new, caledonia, beginning, with, fort, mcleod, today, s, community, of, mcleod, lake, and, fort, fraser, but, ultimately, focused, on, stuart, lake, post, today, s, fort, st, james, negotiations, between, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, over, the, next, few, decades, failed, to, settle, upon, a, compromise, boundary, and, the, oregon, dispute, became, important, in, geopolitical, diplomacy, between, the, british, empire, and, the, new, american, republic, in, 1841, james, sinclair, chief, factor, of, the, hudson, s, bay, company, guided, some, 200, settlers, from, the, red, river, colony, west, to, bolster, settlement, around, fort, vancouver, in, an, attempt, to, retain, the, columbia, district, for, britain, the, party, crossed, the, rockies, into, the, columbia, valley, a, region, of, the, rocky, mountain, trench, near, present, day, radium, hot, springs, british, columbia, then, traveled, south, despite, such, efforts, in, 1846, britain, ceded, all, claim, to, columbia, district, lands, south, of, the, 49th, parallel, to, the, united, states, as, resolution, to, the, oregon, boundary, dispute, by, the, oregon, treaty, thousands, passed, through, the, rocky, mountains, on, the, oregon, trail, beginning, in, the, 1840s, the, mormons, began, settling, near, the, great, salt, lake, in, 1847, from, 1859, to, 1864, gold, was, discovered, in, colorado, idaho, montana, and, british, columbia, sparking, several, gold, rushes, bringing, thousands, of, prospectors, and, miners, to, explore, every, mountain, and, canyon, and, to, create, the, rocky, mountains, first, major, industry, the, idaho, gold, rush, alone, produced, more, gold, than, the, california, and, alaska, gold, rushes, combined, and, was, important, in, the, financing, of, the, union, army, during, the, american, civil, war, the, transcontinental, railroad, was, completed, in, 1869, and, yellowstone, national, park, was, established, as, the, world, s, first, national, park, in, 1872, meanwhile, a, transcontinental, railroad, in, canada, was, originally, promised, in, 1871, though, political, complications, pushed, its, completion, to, 1885, the, canadian, pacific, railway, eventually, followed, the, kicking, horse, and, rogers, passes, to, the, pacific, ocean, canadian, railway, officials, also, convinced, parliament, to, set, aside, vast, areas, of, the, canadian, rockies, as, jasper, banff, yoho, and, waterton, lakes, national, parks, laying, the, foundation, for, a, tourism, industry, which, thrives, to, this, day, glacier, national, park, mt, was, established, with, a, similar, relationship, to, tourism, promotions, by, the, great, northern, railway, while, settlers, filled, the, valleys, and, mining, towns, conservation, and, preservation, ethics, began, to, take, hold, u, s, president, harrison, established, several, forest, reserves, in, the, rocky, mountains, in, 1891, 1892, in, 1905, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, extended, the, medicine, bow, forest, reserve, to, include, the, area, now, managed, as, rocky, mountain, national, park, economic, development, began, to, center, on, mining, forestry, agriculture, and, recreation, as, well, as, on, the, service, industries, that, support, them, tents, and, camps, became, ranches, and, farms, forts, and, train, stations, became, towns, and, some, towns, became, cities, economic, resources, of, the, rocky, mountains, are, varied, and, abundant, minerals, found, in, the, rocky, mountains, include, significant, deposits, of, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, silver, tungsten, and, zinc, the, wyoming, basin, and, several, smaller, areas, contain, significant, reserves, of, coal, natural, gas, oil, shale, and, petroleum, for, example, the, climax, mine, near, leadville, colorado, was, the, largest, producer, of, molybdenum, in, the, world, molybdenum, is, used, in, heat, resistant, steel, in, such, things, as, cars, and, planes, the,
