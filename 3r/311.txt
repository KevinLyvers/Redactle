equator, this, is, because, the, winds, of, the, tropical, monsoons, that, give, seasonal, rains, to, the, sahel, and, the, sudan, blow, from, the, west, consequently, they, lose, their, moisture, before, reaching, djibouti, and, northern, part, of, somalia, with, the, result, that, most, of, the, horn, receives, little, rainfall, during, the, monsoon, season, in, the, mountains, of, ethiopia,
