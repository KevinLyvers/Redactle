1, to, 21, 5, percent, as, a, result, of, migratory, influx, indicative, of, the, socio, economic, difficulties, local, armenians, experienced, under, soviet, azerbaijani, leadership, which, led, them, to, emigrate, from, karabakh, emeritus, professor, of, law, m, cherif, bassiouni, writes, of, the, stagnation, of, the, armenian, population, due, to, the, discriminatory, policies, of, azerbaijani, authorities, that, compelled, armenians, to, emigrate, also, adding, that, 600, 000, armenians, from, karabakh, reside, in, armenia, and, the, countries, of, the, cis, according, to,

were, discriminated, against, in, competing, for, jobs, in, the, province, underinvestment, in, the, region, also, blamed, on, baku, meant, less, economic, development, and, poor, infrastructure, even, by, soviet, standards, and, therefore, fewer, jobs, overall, especially, for, armenians, cultural, ties, with, armenia, were, strangled, in, red, tape, in, baku, and, a, decision, to, make, armenian, language, television, available, in, the, region, was, left, unimplemented, one, result, of, these, policies, was, a, continuing, exodus, of, armenians, from, karabagh, in, search, of,
