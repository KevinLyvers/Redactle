this, treaty, norway, relinquished, all, claims, to, the, kola, peninsula, the, treaty, did, not, address, the, situation, with, the, sami, people, paying, tribute, to, both, norway, and, novgorod, and, the, practice, continued, until, 1602, while, the, 1326, treaty, did, not, define, the, border, in, detail, it, confirmed, the, 1323, border, demarcation, which, remained, more, or, less, unchanged, for, the, next, six, hundred, years, until, 1920, in, the, 15th, century, novgorodians, started, to, establish, permanent, settlements, on, the, peninsula, umba, and, varzuga, the, first, documented, permanent, settlements, of, the, novgorodians, date, back, to, 1466, over, time, all, coastal, areas, to, the, west, of, the, pyalitsa, river, had, been, settled, creating, a, territory, where, the, population, was, mostly, novgorodian, administratively, this, territory, was, divided, into, varzuzhskaya, and, umbskaya, volosts, which, were, governed, by, a, posadnik, from, the, area, of, the, northern, dvina, the, novgorod, republic, lost, control, of, both, of, these, volosts, to, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, after, the, battle, of, shelon, in, 1471, and, the, republic, itself, ceased, to, exist, in, 1478, when, ivan, iii, took, the, city, of, novgorod, all, novgorod, territories, including, those, on, the, kola, peninsula, became, a, part, of, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow,

established, on, the, peninsula, the, sami, peoples, were, subject, to, forced, collectivization, with, more, than, half, of, their, reindeer, herds, collectivized, in, 1928, 1930, in, addition, the, traditional, sami, herding, practices, were, phased, out, in, favor, of, the, more, economically, profitable, komi, approach, which, emphasized, permanent, settlements, over, free, herding, since, the, sami, culture, is, strongly, tied, to, the, herding, practices, this, resulted, in, the, sami, people, gradually, losing, their, language, and, traditional, herding, knowledge, most, sami, were, forced, to, settle, in, the, village, of, lovozero, which, became, the, cultural, center, of, the, sami, people, in, russia, those, sami, resisting, the, collectivization, were, subject, to, forced,

mostly, along, the, shores, however, the, discovery, of, the, vast, natural, resource, deposits, and, industrialization, efforts, led, to, an, explosive, population, growth, during, the, soviet, times, by, 1970, the, population, of, the, peninsula, was, around, 799, 000, the, trend, reverted, in, the, 1990s, after, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, the, population, of, the, whole,

archangel, although, the, settlement, of, kola, was, still, permitted, to, trade, locally, produced, goods, during, the, 17th, century, the, salt, extraction, activities, gradually, went, into, decline, as, the, locally, produced, salt, was, uncompetitive, with, cheap, salt, produced, in, the, kama, river, regions, extensive, poaching, also, led, to, the, significantly, reduced, outputs, from, pearl, hunting, commercial, deer, herding, became, more, popular, although, its, share, in, the, economy, remained, negligible, until, the, 19th, century, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century,
