the, bering, sea, b, r, b, r, bair, ing, berr, ing, us, also, b, r, beer, ing, russian, romanized, b, ringovo, m, re, ipa, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, northern, pacific, ocean, it, forms, along, with, the, bering, strait, the, divide, between, the, two, largest, landmasses, on, earth, eurasia, and, the, americas, it, comprises, a, deep, water, basin, which, then, rises, through, a, narrow, slope, into, the, shallower, water, above, the, continental, shelves, the, bering, sea, is, named, after, vitus, bering, a, danish, born, russian, navigator, who, in, 1728, was, the, first, european, to, systematically, explore, it, sailing, from, the, pacific, ocean, northward, to, the, arctic, ocean, the, bering, sea, is, separated, from, the, gulf, of, alaska, by, the, alaska, peninsula, it, covers, over, 2, 000, 000, square, kilometers, 770, 000, sq, mi, and, is, bordered, on, the, east, and, northeast, by, alaska, on, the, west, by, the, russian, far, east, and, the, kamchatka, peninsula, on, the, south, by, the, alaska, peninsula, and, the, aleutian, islands, and, on, the, far, north, by, the, bering, strait, which, connects, the, bering, sea, to, the, arctic, ocean, s, chukchi, sea, bristol, bay, is, the, portion, of, the, bering, sea, between, the, alaska, peninsula, and, cape, newenham, on, mainland, southwest, alaska, the, bering, sea, ecosystem, includes, resources, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, united, states, and, russia, as, well, as, international, waters, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, known, as, the, donut, hole, the, interaction, between, currents, sea, ice, and, weather, makes, for, a, vigorous, and, productive, ecosystem, most, scientists, think, that, during, the, most, recent, ice, age, sea, level, was, low, enough, to, allow, humans, to, migrate, east, on, foot, from, asia, to, north, america, across, what, is, now, the, bering, strait, other, animals, including, megafauna, migrated, in, both, directions, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, bering, land, bridge, and, is, accepted, by, most, though, not, all, scientists, to, be, the, first, point, of, entry, of, humans, into, the, americas, there, is, a, small, portion, of, the, kula, plate, in, the, bering, sea, the, kula, plate, is, an, ancient, tectonic, plate, that, used, to, subduct, under, alaska, on, 18, december, 2018, a, large, meteor, exploded, above, the, bering, sea, the, meteor, exploded, at, an, altitude, of, 25, 6km, releasing, 49, kilotons, of, energy, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, bering, sea, as, follows, islands, of, the, bering, sea, include, regions, of, the, bering, sea, include, the, bering, sea, contains, 16, submarine, canyons, including, the, largest, submarine, canyon, in, the, world, zhemchug, canyon, the, bering, sea, shelf, break, is, the, dominant, driver, of, primary, productivity, in, the, bering, sea, this, zone, where, the, shallower, continental, shelf, drops, off, into, the, north, aleutians, basin, is, also, known, as, the, greenbelt, nutrient, upwelling, from, the, cold, waters, of, the, aleutian, basin, flowing, up, the, slope, and, mixing, with, shallower, waters, of, the, shelf, provide, for, constant, production, of, phytoplankton, the, second, driver, of, productivity, in, the, bering, sea, is, seasonal, sea, ice, that, in, part, triggers, the, spring, phytoplankton, bloom, seasonal, melting, of, sea, ice, causes, an, influx, of, lower, salinity, water, into, the, middle, and, other, shelf, areas, causing, stratification, and, hydrographic, effects, which, influence, productivity, in, addition, to, the, hydrographic, and, productivity, influence, of, melting, sea, ice, the, ice, itself, also, provides, an, attachment, substrate, for, the, growth, of, algae, as, well, as, interstitial, ice, algae, some, evidence, suggests, that, great, changes, to, the, bering, sea, ecosystem, have, already, occurred, warm, water, conditions, in, the, summer, of, 1997, resulted, in, a, massive, bloom, of, low, energy, coccolithophorid, phytoplankton, stockwell, et, al, 2001, a, long, record, of, carbon, isotopes, which, is, reflective, of, primary, production, trends, of, the, bering, sea, exists, from, historical, samples, of, bowhead, whale, baleen, trends, in, carbon, isotope, ratios, in, whale, baleen, samples, suggest, that, a, 30, 40, decline, in, average, seasonal, primary, productivity, has, occurred, over, the, last, 50, years, the, implication, is, that, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, bering, sea, is, much, lower, now, than, it, has, been, in, the, past, the, sea, supports, many, whale, species, including, the, beluga, humpback, whale, bowhead, whale, gray, whale, and, blue, whale, the, vulnerable, sperm, whale, and, the, endangered, fin, whale, sei, whale, and, the, rarest, in, the, world, the, north, pacific, right, whale, other, marine, mammals, include, walrus, steller, sea, lion, northern, fur, seal, orca, and, polar, bear, the, bering, sea, is, very, important, to, the, seabirds, of, the, world, over, 30, species, of, seabirds, and, approximately, 20, million, individuals, breed, in, the, bering, sea, region, seabird, species, include, tufted, puffins, the, endangered, short, tailed, albatross, spectacled, eider, and, red, legged, kittiwakes, many, of, these, species, are, unique, to, the, area, which, provides, highly, productive, foraging, habitat, particularly, along, the, shelf, edge, and, in, other, nutrient, rich, upwelling, regions, such, as, the, pribilof, zhemchug, and, pervenets, canyons, the, bering, sea, is, also, home, to, colonies, of, crested, auklets, with, upwards, of, a, million, individuals, two, bering, sea, species, the, steller, s, sea, cow, hydrodamalis, gigas, and, spectacled, cormorant, phalacrocorax, perspicillatus, are, extinct, because, of, overexploitation, by, man, in, addition, a, small, subspecies, of, canada, goose, the, bering, canada, goose, branta, canadensis, asiatica, is, extinct, due, to, overhunting, and, the, introduction, of, rats, to, their, breeding, islands, the, bering, sea, supports, many, species, of, fish, some, of, which, support, large, and, valuable, commercial, fisheries, commercial, fish, species, include, pacific, cod, several, species, of, flatfish, sablefish, pacific, salmon, and, pacific, herring, shellfish, include, red, king, crab, and, snow, crab, fish, biodiversity, is, high, and, at, least, 419, species, of, fish, have, been, reported, from, the, bering, sea, the, bering, sea, is, world, renowned, for, its, productive, and, profitable, fisheries, such, as, king, crab, opilio, and, tanner, crabs, bristol, bay, salmon, pollock, and, other, groundfish, these, fisheries, rely, on, the, productivity, of, the, bering, sea, via, a, complicated, and, little, understood, food, web, commercial, fishing, is, lucrative, business, in, the, bering, sea, which, is, relied, upon, by, the, largest, seafood, companies, in, the, world, to, produce, fish, and, shellfish, on, the, u, s, side, commercial, fisheries, catch, approximately, 1, billion, worth, of, seafood, annually, while, russian, bering, sea, fisheries, are, worth, approximately, 600, million, annually, the, bering, sea, also, serves, as, the, central, location, of, the, alaskan, king, crab, and, snow, crab, seasons, which, are, chronicled, on, the, discovery, channel, television, program, deadliest, catch, landings, from, alaskan, waters, represents, half, the, u, s, catch, of, fish, and, shellfish, because, of, the, changes, going, on, in, the, arctic, the, future, evolution, of, the, bering, sea, climate, and, ecosystem, is, uncertain, between, 1979, and, 2012, the, region, experienced, small, growth, in, sea, ice, extent, standing, in, contrast, to, the, substantial, loss, of, summer, sea, ice, in, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, north, the, white, seal, one, of, many, chapters, on, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, features, the, bering, sea, as, the, birthplace, and, homeland, of, kotick, a, rare, white, fur, seal, the, film, harbinger, down, which, was, released, on, august, 7, 2015, was, about, a, group, of, grad, students, who, booked, passage, on, the, crabbing, boat, harbinger, to, study, the, effects, of, global, warming, on, a, pod, of, beluga, whales, in, the, bering, sea, one, of, the, central, characters, in, the, 1949, film, down, to, the, sea, in, ships, has, the, given, name, bering, due, to, having, been, born, in, a, ship, crossing, the, bering, sea, the, 2002, supernatural, thriller, ghost, ship, directed, by, steve, beck, follows, a, marine, salvage, crew, in, the, bering, sea, who, discover, the, lost, italian, ocean, liner, antonia, graza, that, disappeared, in, 1962
