the, grand, canal, chinese, pinyin, d, y, nh, is, a, system, of, interconnected, canals, linking, various, major, rivers, in, north, and, east, china, serving, as, an, important, waterborne, transport, infrastructure, between, the, north, and, the, south, during, medieval, and, premodern, china, it, is, the, longest, artificial, waterway, in, the, world, and, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, grand, canal, s, main, stem, known, to, the, chinese, as, the, jing, hang, grand, canal, is, thought, to, extend, for, 1, 776, km, 1, 104, mi, and, is, divided, into, 6, main, subsections, the, jiangnan, canal, runs, from, the, qiantang, river, at, hangzhou, to, the, yangtze, river, at, zhenjiang, the, inner, canal, from, the, yangtze, at, yangzhou, to, the, huai, river, at, huai, an, which, for, centuries, was, also, its, junction, with, the, former, course, of, the, yellow, river, the, middle, canal, from, huai, an, to, the, nansi, lakes, the, lu, canal, from, the, lakes, past, jining, and, the, present, course, of, the, yellow, river, to, the, wei, river, at, linqing, the, southern, canal, from, linqing, to, the, hai, river, at, tianjin, and, the, northern, canal, from, tianjin, to, tongzhou, on, the, outskirts, of, beijing, as, such, it, passes, through, the, provinces, and, municipalities, of, zhejiang, jiangsu, shandong, hebei, tianjin, and, beijing, in, 2014, the, chinese, government, and, unesco, recognized, the, eastern, zhejiang, canal, from, hangzhou, to, ningbo, along, the, former, tongji, and, yongji, canals, as, official, components, of, the, grand, canal, the, oldest, sections, of, what, is, now, the, grand, canal, were, completed, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, during, the, conflicts, of, china, s, spring, and, autumn, period, to, provide, supplies, and, transport, routes, for, the, states, of, wu, and, yue, the, network, was, completed, by, emperor, yang, of, the, sui, dynasty, in, ad, 609, linking, the, fertile, jiangnan, region, in, the, south, to, his, capital, at, luoyang, in, the, west, and, to, his, armies, in, the, far, north, his, unsuccessful, and, unpopular, wars, and, the, massive, amounts, of, conscripted, labor, involved, in, creating, the, canal, were, among, the, chief, factors, in, the, rapid, fall, of, the, sui, but, the, connection, of, china, s, major, watersheds, and, population, centers, proved, enormously, beneficial, additional, canals, supplied, chang, an, now, xi, an, even, further, west, under, the, tang, dynasty, while, stopover, towns, along, the, main, course, became, the, economic, hubs, of, the, empire, periodic, flooding, of, the, yellow, river, threatened, the, safety, and, functioning, of, the, canal, while, during, wartime, the, rivers, high, dikes, were, sometimes, deliberately, broken, to, delay, or, sweep, away, advancing, enemy, troops, even, so, restoration, and, improvement, of, the, canal, and, its, associated, flood, control, works, was, assumed, as, a, duty, by, each, successive, dynasty, the, canal, played, a, major, role, in, periodically, reuniting, northern, and, southern, china, and, officials, in, charge, of, the, canal, and, nearby, salt, works, grew, enormously, wealthy, despite, damage, from, floods, rebellions, and, wars, the, canal, s, importance, only, grew, with, the, removal, of, the, capital, to, khanbaliq, under, the, mongol, yuan, and, to, beijing, under, yongle, emperor, of, the, ming, dynasty, and, the, manchu, qing, dynasty, despite, the, importance, of, railways, and, roads, in, modern, china, the, people, s, republic, of, china, has, worked, to, improve, the, navigability, of, the, canal, since, the, end, of, the, chinese, civil, war, and, the, portion, south, of, the, yellow, river, remains, in, heavy, use, by, barges, carrying, bulk, cargo, increasing, concern, over, pollution, in, china, and, particularly, the, use, of, the, grand, canal, as, the, eastern, path, of, the, south, north, water, diversion, project, intended, to, provide, clean, potable, water, to, the, north, has, led, to, regulations, and, several, projects, to, improve, water, quality, along, the, waterway, the, greatest, height, on, the, canal, is, an, elevation, of, 42, m, 138, ft, above, sea, level, reached, in, the, foothills, of, shandong, ships, in, chinese, canals, did, not, have, trouble, reaching, higher, elevations, after, the, song, official, and, engineer, qiao, weiyue, invented, the, pound, lock, in, the, 10th, century, the, canal, has, been, admired, by, many, visitors, throughout, its, history, including, the, japanese, monk, ennin, 794, 864, the, persian, historian, rashid, al, din, hamadani, 1247, 1318, the, korean, official, choe, bu, 1454, 1504, and, the, italian, missionary, matteo, ricci, 1552, 1610, in, the, late, spring, and, autumn, period, king, fuchai, of, wu, whose, capital, was, in, present, day, suzhou, ventured, north, to, attack, the, state, of, qi, he, ordered, a, canal, to, be, constructed, for, trading, purposes, as, well, as, a, means, to, ship, ample, supplies, north, in, case, his, forces, should, engage, the, northern, states, of, song, and, lu, this, became, known, as, the, han, or, hangou, canal, t, s, h, ng, u, work, began, in, 486, bc, from, south, of, yangzhou, to, north, of, huai, an, in, jiangsu, and, within, three, years, the, han, canal, had, connected, the, yangtze, with, the, huai, river, utilizing, existing, waterways, lakes, and, marshes, the, han, canal, is, known, as, the, second, oldest, section, of, the, later, grand, canal, since, the, hong, canal, t, s, h, ngg, u, canal, of, the, wild, geese, or, far, flung, canal, most, likely, preceded, it, it, linked, the, yellow, river, near, kaifeng, to, the, si, and, bian, rivers, and, became, the, model, for, the, shape, of, the, grand, canal, in, the, north, the, exact, date, of, the, hong, canal, s, construction, is, uncertain, it, is, first, mentioned, by, the, diplomat, su, qin, in, 330, bc, when, discussing, state, boundaries, the, historian, sima, qian, 145, 90, bc, knew, of, no, historical, date, for, it, placing, his, discussion, of, it, just, after, the, legendary, works, of, yu, the, great, modern, scholars, now, consider, it, to, belong, to, the, 6th, century, bc, the, reunification, of, china, under, the, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, ended, three, centuries, of, chaos, since, the, upheaval, of, the, five, barbarians, and, the, renewed, political, stability, allowed, both, the, thorough, repair, of, existing, canals, and, flood, control, systems, as, well, as, the, construction, of, new, canals, the, primary, consideration, of, the, sui, canals, was, the, need, to, tap, into, the, expanding, economic, and, agricultural, resources, of, the, jiangnan, region, in, the, southeast, to, enrich, the, main, sui, capital, at, luoyang, to, the, west, and, to, supply, the, expeditionary, sui, armies, in, the, goguryeo, sui, wars, to, the, northeast, the, institution, of, the, grand, canal, also, obviated, the, need, for, army, garrisons, to, become, self, sufficient, part, time, militia, farmers, while, guarding, the, dry, frontiers, between, china, goguryeo, and, g, kt, rk, a, dike, building, project, in, 587, along, the, yellow, river, overseen, by, engineer, liang, rui, established, canal, lock, gates, to, regulate, water, levels, for, the, canal, double, slipways, were, installed, to, haul, boats, over, when, the, difference, in, water, levels, was, too, great, for, the, flash, lock, to, operate, similarly, by, the, year, 600, there, were, major, buildups, of, silt, on, the, bottom, of, the, hong, canal, obstructing, river, barges, whose, drafts, were, too, deep, for, its, waters, the, chief, engineer, of, the, sui, dynasty, yuwen, kai, advised, the, digging, of, a, new, canal, that, would, run, parallel, to, the, existing, canal, diverging, from, it, at, chenliu, yanzhou, the, new, canal, was, to, pass, not, xuzhou, but, suzhou, to, avoid, connecting, with, the, si, river, and, instead, make, a, direct, connection, with, the, huai, river, just, west, of, lake, hongze, with, the, recorded, labor, of, five, million, people, under, the, supervision, of, ma, shumou, the, first, major, section, of, the, grand, canal, was, completed, in, the, year, 605, and, was, called, the, bian, qu, the, grand, canal, was, fully, completed, from, the, years, 604, to, 609, under, emperor, yang, first, by, linking, his, southern, capital, yangzhou, northwest, to, luoyang, by, the, tongji, canal, t, s, t, ngj, q, he, then, proceeded, to, connect, yangzhou, southeast, to, suzhou, and, hangzhou, by, the, jiangnan, canal, and, to, connect, luoyang, northeast, to, his, wars, with, korea, by, the, yongji, canal, t, s, y, ngj, q, after, this, network, s, completion, in, 609, emperor, yang, was, said, to, have, led, a, flotilla, of, boats, 105, km, 65, mi, long, from, the, north, down, to, his, southern, capital, at, yangzhou, this, process, again, involved, massive, levies, of, conscripted, labor, and, was, detailed, at, length, in, the, record, of, the, opening, of, the, canal, t, s, k, ih, j, at, this, point, the, grand, canal, continued, to, use, noncontiguous, artificial, channels, and, both, canalized, and, natural, waterways, rather, than, presenting, a, single, continuous, manmade, canal, however, running, alongside, and, parallel, to, the, course, of, the, canals, was, an, imperial, roadway, with, stables, maintained, at, regular, intervals, to, support, a, rapid, courier, system, enormous, lines, of, trees, were, also, planted, along, parts, of, the, canal, as, windbreaks, although, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, capital, at, chang, an, was, the, most, thriving, metropolis, of, china, in, its, day, it, was, the, city, of, yangzhou, in, proximity, to, the, grand, canal, that, was, the, economic, hub, of, the, tang, era, besides, being, the, headquarters, for, the, government, salt, monopoly, and, the, largest, pre, modern, industrial, production, center, of, the, empire, yangzhou, was, also, the, geographical, midpoint, along, the, north, south, trade, axis, and, so, became, the, major, center, for, southern, goods, shipped, north, one, of, the, greatest, benefits, of, the, canal, system, in, the, tang, dynasty, and, subsequent, dynasties, was, that, it, reduced, the, cost, of, shipping, grain, that, had, been, collected, in, taxes, caoyun, from, the, yangtze, delta, to, northern, china, minor, additions, to, the, canal, were, made, after, the, sui, period, to, cut, down, on, travel, time, but, overall, no, fundamental, differences, existed, between, the, sui, grand, canal, and, the, tang, grand, canal, by, the, year, 735, it, was, recorded, that, about, 149, 685, 400, kilograms, 165, 000, short, tons, of, grain, were, shipped, annually, along, the, canal, the, tang, government, oversaw, canal, lock, efficiency, and, built, granaries, along, the, route, in, case, a, flood, or, other, disaster, impeded, the, path, of, shipment, to, ensure, smooth, travel, of, grain, shipments, transport, commissioner, liu, yan, in, office, from, 763, to, 779, had, special, river, barge, ships, designed, and, constructed, to, fit, the, depths, of, each, section, of, the, entire, canal, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, 755, 763, the, economy, of, north, china, was, greatly, damaged, and, never, recovered, due, to, wars, and, to, constant, flooding, of, the, yellow, river, such, a, case, occurred, in, the, year, 858, when, an, enormous, flood, along, the, grand, canal, inundated, thousands, of, acres, of, farmland, and, killed, tens, of, thousands, of, people, in, the, north, china, plain, such, an, unfortunate, event, could, reduce, the, legitimacy, of, a, ruling, dynasty, by, causing, others, to, perceive, it, as, having, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, this, was, a, good, reason, for, dynastic, authorities, to, maintain, a, smooth, and, efficient, canal, system, the, city, of, kaifeng, grew, to, be, a, major, hub, later, becoming, the, capital, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, although, the, tang, and, song, dynasty, international, seaports, the, greatest, being, guangzhou, and, quanzhou, respectively, and, maritime, foreign, trade, brought, merchants, great, fortune, it, was, the, grand, canal, within, china, that, spurred, the, greatest, amount, of, economic, activity, and, commercial, profit, during, the, song, and, earlier, periods, barge, ships, occasionally, crashed, and, wrecked, along, the, shanyang, yundao, section, of, the, grand, canal, while, passing, the, double, slipways, and, more, often, than, not, those, were, then, robbed, of, the, tax, grain, by, local, bandits, this, prompted, qiao, weiyue, an, assistant, commissioner, of, transport, for, huainan, to, invent, a, double, gate, system, known, as, the, pound, lock, in, the, year, 984, this, allowed, ships, to, wait, within, a, gated, space, while, the, water, could, be, drained, to, appropriate, levels, the, chinese, also, built, roofed, hangars, over, the, space, to, add, further, protection, for, the, ships, much, of, the, grand, canal, was, ruined, for, several, years, after, 1128, when, kaifeng, s, governor, du, chong, d, ch, ng, d, 1141, decided, to, break, the, dykes, and, dams, holding, back, the, waters, of, the, yellow, river, in, order, to, decimate, the, oncoming, jurchen, invaders, during, the, jin, song, wars, over, a, series, of, floods, this, entirely, shifted, the, river, south, of, shandong, capturing, the, course, of, the, si, river, and, emptying, the, yellow, river, into, hongze, lake, and, the, east, china, sea, for, centuries, the, jurchen, jin, dynasty, continually, battled, with, the, song, in, this, region, the, warfare, led, to, the, dilapidation, of, the, canal, until, the, mongols, invaded, in, the, 13th, century, and, began, necessary, repairs, during, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, 1271, 1368, the, capital, of, china, was, moved, to, beijing, eliminating, the, need, for, the, canal, arm, flowing, west, to, kaifeng, or, luoyang, a, summit, section, was, dug, across, the, foothills, of, the, shandong, massif, during, the, 1280s, shortening, the, overall, length, by, as, much, as, 700, km, 430, mi, making, the, total, length, about, 1, 800, km, 1, 100, mi, and, linking, hangzhou, and, beijing, with, a, direct, north, south, waterway, for, the, first, time, as, in, the, song, and, jin, era, the, canal, fell, into, disuse, and, dilapidation, during, the, yuan, dynasty, s, decline, the, grand, canal, as, infrastructure, has, had, influence, on, other, architectural, works, in, the, west, the, erie, canal, in, north, america, is, designed, and, draws, inspiration, from, the, chinese, architecture, many, saw, the, canal, as, an, economic, advantage, that, could, bring, economic, prosperity, like, the, canal, and, its, benefits, matteo, ricci, s, journals, describes, the, canal, in, great, detail, documenting, the, economic, prosperity, the, pound, lock, is, one, of, the, more, notable, features, of, the, erie, canal, that, is, directly, connected, to, the, infrastructure, of, the, grand, canal, as, it, is, used, in, other, similar, bodies, of, water, the, grand, canal, was, renovated, almost, in, its, entirety, between, 1411, and, 1415, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, a, magistrate, of, jining, shandong, sent, a, memorandum, to, the, throne, of, the, yongle, emperor, protesting, the, current, inefficient, means, of, transporting, 4, 000, 000, dan, 428, 000, 000, liters, of, grain, a, year, by, means, of, transferring, it, along, several, different, rivers, and, canals, in, barge, types, that, went, from, deep, to, shallow, after, the, huai, river, and, then, transferred, back, onto, deep, barges, once, the, shipment, of, grain, reached, the, yellow, river, chinese, engineers, built, a, dam, to, divert, the, wen, river, to, the, southwest, in, order, to, feed, 60, of, its, water, north, into, the, grand, canal, with, the, remainder, going, south, they, dug, four, large, reservoirs, in, shandong, to, regulate, water, levels, which, allowed, them, to, avoid, pumping, water, from, local, sources, and, water, tables, between, 1411, and, 1415, a, total, of, 165, 000, laborers, dredged, the, canal, bed, in, shandong, and, built, new, channels, embankments, and, canal, locks, the, yongle, emperor, moved, the, ming, capital, from, nanjing, to, beijing, in, 1403, this, move, deprived, nanjing, of, its, status, as, chief, political, center, of, china, the, reopening, of, the, grand, canal, also, benefited, suzhou, over, nanjing, since, the, former, was, in, a, better, position, on, the, main, artery, of, the, grand, canal, and, so, it, became, ming, china, s, greatest, economic, center, the, only, other, viable, contender, with, suzhou, in, the, jiangnan, region, was, hangzhou, but, it, was, located, 200, km, 120, mi, further, down, the, grand, canal, and, away, from, the, main, delta, even, the, shipwrecked, korean, choe, bu, 1454, 1504, while, traveling, for, five, months, throughout, china, in, 1488, acknowledged, that, hangzhou, served, not, as, a, competitor, but, as, an, economic, feeder, into, the, greater, suzhou, market, therefore, the, grand, canal, served, to, make, or, break, the, economic, fortunes, of, certain, cities, along, its, route, and, served, as, the, economic, lifeline, of, indigenous, trade, within, china, the, scholar, gu, yanwu, of, the, early, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1912, estimated, that, the, previous, ming, dynasty, had, to, employ, 47, 004, full, time, laborers, recruited, by, the, lijia, corv, e, system, in, order, to, maintain, the, entire, canal, system, it, is, known, that, 121, 500, soldiers, and, officers, were, needed, simply, to, operate, the, 11, 775, government, grain, barges, in, the, mid, 15th, century, besides, its, function, as, a, grain, shipment, route, and, major, vein, of, river, borne, indigenous, trade, in, china, the, grand, canal, had, long, been, a, government, operated, courier, route, as, well, in, the, ming, dynasty, official, courier, stations, were, placed, at, intervals, of, 35, to, 45, km, 22, to, 28, mi, each, courier, station, was, assigned, a, different, name, all, of, which, were, popularized, in, travel, songs, of, the, period, the, manchus, invaded, china, in, the, mid, 17th, century, allowed, through, the, northern, passes, by, the, chinese, general, wu, sangui, once, the, ming, capital, at, beijing, had, fallen, into, the, hands, of, a, rebel, army, the, manchus, established, the, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1912, and, under, their, leadership, the, grand, canal, was, overseen, and, maintained, just, as, in, earlier, times, in, 1855, the, yellow, river, flooded, and, changed, its, course, severing, the, course, of, the, canal, in, shandong, this, was, foreseen, by, a, chinese, official, in, 1447, who, remarked, that, the, flood, prone, yellow, river, made, the, grand, canal, like, a, throat, that, could, be, easily, strangled, leading, some, officials, to, request, restarting, the, grain, shipments, through, the, east, china, sea, in, 1855, the, dikes, of, the, canal, were, opened, to, flood, advancing, troops, of, the, taiping, rebellion, s, northern, expedition, because, of, various, factors, the, difficulty, of, crossing, the, yellow, river, the, increased, development, of, an, alternative, sea, route, for, grain, ships, and, the, opening, of, the, tianjin, pukou, railway, and, the, beijing, hankou, railway, the, canal, languished, and, for, decades, the, northern, and, southern, parts, remained, separate, many, of, the, canal, sections, fell, into, disrepair, and, some, parts, were, returned, to, flat, fields, even, today, the, grand, canal, has, not, fully, recovered, its, importance, prior, to, the, floods, of, the, mid, 19th, century, after, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, the, need, for, economic, development, led, the, authorities, to, order, heavy, reconstruction, work, the, grand, canal, played, a, major, role, during, mao, zedong, s, great, leap, forward, as, it, provided, an, efficient, way, to, transport, grain, it, was, further, refurbished, following, deng, xiaoping, s, reform, and, opening, up, with, improving, economic, conditions, leading, to, greater, infrastructure, investment, the, economic, importance, of, the, canal, will, likely, continue, the, provincial, governments, of, shandong, jiangsu, and, zhejiang, undertook, dredging, intended, to, increase, shipping, capacity, by, 40, percent, by, 2012, the, central, government, has, also, made, the, main, route, of, the, grand, canal, the, eastern, path, of, the, south, north, water, diversion, project, using, enormous, pumping, stations, to, redirect, water, from, the, yangtze, delta, to, the, drier, north, the, canal, became, greatly, polluted, during, china, s, industrialization, by, the, 1990s, canal, barge, crews, could, tell, when, they, neared, hangzhou, by, the, stench, of, the, visibly, black, water, they, passed, through, similarly, fishermen, on, dongping, lake, in, shandong, objected, to, the, introduction, of, water, from, the, yangtze, as, part, of, the, south, north, water, diversion, project, when, they, saw, it, noticeably, killing, fish, and, affecting, their, catch, during, the, 21st, century, increasing, efforts, have, been, made, to, improve, environmental, conditions, along, the, canal, around, hangzhou, for, instance, a, 250, million, restoration, project, begun, in, 2001, improved, water, quality, to, the, point, where, it, no, longer, produces, a, noticeable, odor, and, is, once, again, capable, of, supporting, some, fauna, on, 22, june, 2014, unesco, s, conference, on, world, heritage, listed, the, grand, canal, as, a, world, heritage, site, as, well, as, its, present, day, course, fourteen, centuries, of, canal, building, have, left, the, grand, canal, with, a, number, of, historical, sections, some, of, these, have, disappeared, others, are, still, partially, extant, and, others, form, the, basis, for, the, modern, canal, the, following, are, the, most, important, but, do, not, form, an, exhaustive, list, in, 12, bc, in, order, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, grand, canal, having, to, use, 160, kilometers, 100, mi, of, the, perilous, course, of, the, yellow, river, in, northern, jiangsu, a, man, named, li, hualong, created, the, jia, canal, named, after, the, jia, river, whose, course, it, followed, it, ran, 140, kilometers, 87, mi, from, xiazhen, modern, weishan, on, the, shore, of, shandong, s, weishan, lake, to, suqian, in, jiangsu, the, construction, of, the, jia, canal, left, only, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, of, yellow, river, navigation, on, the, grand, canal, from, suqian, to, huai, an, which, by, 1688, had, been, removed, by, the, construction, of, the, middle, canal, by, jin, fu, in, 1566, to, escape, the, problems, caused, by, flooding, of, the, yellow, river, around, yutai, now, on, the, western, shore, of, weishan, lake, the, nanyang, new, canal, was, opened, it, ran, for, 75, kilometers, 47, mi, from, nanyang, now, nanyang, town, located, in, the, center, of, weishan, lake, to, the, small, settlement, of, liucheng, in, the, vicinity, of, modern, gaolou, village, weishan, county, shandong, north, of, xuzhou, city, this, change, in, effect, moved, the, grand, canal, from, the, low, lying, and, flood, prone, land, west, of, weishan, lake, onto, the, marginally, higher, land, to, its, east, it, was, fed, by, rivers, flowing, from, east, to, west, from, the, borders, of, the, shandong, massif, north, of, the, jizhou, canal, summit, section, the, huitong, canal, ran, downhill, fed, principally, by, the, river, wen, to, join, the, wei, river, in, the, city, of, linqing, in, 1289, a, geological, survey, preceded, its, one, year, construction, the, huitong, canal, built, by, an, engineer, called, ma, zhizhen, ran, across, sharply, sloping, ground, and, the, high, concentration, of, locks, gave, it, the, nicknames, chahe, or, zhahe, i, e, the, river, of, locks, its, great, number, of, feeder, springs, between, two, and, four, hundred, depending, on, the, counting, method, and, season, of, the, year, also, led, to, it, being, called, the, quanhe, or, river, of, springs, this, the, grand, canal, s, first, true, summit, section, was, engineered, by, the, mongol, oqruq, i, in, 1238, to, connect, jining, to, the, southern, end, of, the, huitong, canal, it, rose, to, a, height, of, 42, meters, 138, ft, above, the, yangtze, but, environmental, and, technical, factors, left, it, with, chronic, water, shortages, until, it, was, re, engineered, in, 1411, by, song, li, of, the, ming, song, li, s, improvements, recommended, by, a, local, man, named, bai, ying, included, damming, the, rivers, wen, and, guang, and, drawing, lateral, canals, from, them, to, feed, reservoir, lakes, at, the, very, summit, at, a, small, town, called, nanwang, in, ad, 369, general, huan, wen, of, the, eastern, jin, dynasty, connected, the, shallow, river, valleys, of, the, huai, and, the, yellow, he, achieved, this, by, joining, two, of, these, rivers, tributaries, the, si, and, the, ji, respectively, at, their, closest, point, across, a, low, watershed, of, the, shandong, massif, huan, wen, s, primitive, summit, canal, became, a, model, for, the, engineers, of, the, jizhou, canal, the, shanyang, canal, originally, opened, onto, the, yangtze, a, short, distance, south, of, yangzhou, as, the, north, shore, of, the, yangtze, gradually, silted, up, to, create, the, sandbank, island, of, guazhou, it, became, necessary, for, boats, crossing, to, and, from, the, jiangnan, canal, to, sail, the, long, way, around, the, eastern, edge, of, that, island, after, a, particularly, rough, crossing, of, the, yangtze, from, zhenjiang, the, local, prefect, realized, that, a, canal, dug, directly, across, guazhou, would, reduce, the, journey, time, and, thus, make, the, crossing, safer, the, yilou, canal, was, opened, in, 738, and, still, exists, though, not, as, part, of, the, modern, grand, canal, route, the, grand, canal, nominally, runs, between, beijing, and, hangzhou, over, a, total, length, of, 1, 794, km, 1, 115, mi, however, only, the, section, from, hangzhou, to, liangshan, county, is, currently, navigable, its, course, is, today, divided, into, seven, sections, from, south, to, north, these, are, the, jiangnan, canal, the, li, canal, the, inner, canal, the, middle, canal, the, lu, canal, the, south, canal, the, north, canal, and, the, tonghui, river, man, made, lake, lianhu, training, lake, lianhu, was, used, to, feed, water, to, the, grand, canal, section, near, jiangnan, since, the, canal, was, man, made, there, was, not, enough, naturally, flowing, water, to, keep, the, canal, at, proper, depth, so, that, boats, could, travel, through, it, so, a, man, made, lake, was, used, to, feed, water, to, the, jiangnan, section, of, the, grand, canal, it, was, protected, by, the, government, from, reclamation, and, any, use, of, the, lake, water, without, proper, taxation, was, deemed, illegal, it, was, supposed, to, be, protected, from, profitable, exploitation, but, because, the, government, changed, over, the, years, lake, lianhu, had, been, reclaimed, many, times, and, it, started, to, become, more, shallow, the, government, changed, the, lake, to, become, more, profitable, farmland, which, led, to, reclamations, and, agricultural, irrigation, using, the, lake, this, began, to, lead, to, lake, lianhu, not, being, able, to, properly, feed, water, to, the, grand, canal, loss, of, depth, due, to, reclamation, and, maintenance, costs, became, too, high, for, the, lake, to, become, practical, to, use, even, though, it, was, a, man, made, lake, it, was, still, a, beautiful, sight, many, different, people, praised, its, beauty, and, various, poems, have, been, written, about, the, lake, in, recent, years, recreational, uses, for, the, lake, have, become, more, popular, and, may, lead, to, the, lake, being, restored, this, southernmost, section, of, the, canal, runs, from, hangzhou, in, zhejiang, where, the, canal, connects, with, the, qiantang, river, to, zhenjiang, in, jiangsu, where, it, meets, the, yangtze, after, leaving, hangzhou, heading, north, toward, beijing, the, canal, passes, around, the, eastern, border, of, lake, tai, through, the, major, cities, of, jiaxing, suzhou, wuxi, and, changzhou, before, reaching, zhenjiang, the, jiangnan, or, south, of, the, yangtze, canal, is, heavily, utilized, by, barge, traffic, bringing, coal, containers, and, construction, materials, to, the, booming, delta, it, is, generally, a, minimum, of, 100, meters, wide, in, the, congested, city, centers, and, often, two, or, three, times, this, width, in, the, neighboring, countryside, in, recent, years, broad, bypass, canals, have, been, dug, around, the, major, cities, to, reduce, traffic, jams, the, suzhou, section, of, the, jiangnan, canal, flows, through, the, western, part, of, the, city, it, includes, ten, city, gates, and, over, 20, stone, bridges, of, traditional, design, and, historic, areas, that, have, been, well, preserved, as, well, as, temples, and, pavilions, the, inner, canal, runs, between, the, yangtze, and, huai, rivers, skirting, the, shaobo, gaoyou, and, hongze, lakes, of, central, jiangsu, this, section, connects, the, cities, of, huai, an, and, yangzhou, here, the, land, lying, to, the, west, of, the, canal, is, higher, than, its, bed, while, the, land, to, the, east, is, lower, historically, the, shanghe, region, west, of, the, canal, has, been, prone, to, frequent, flooding, while, the, xiahe, region, to, its, east, has, been, hit, by, less, frequent, but, immensely, damaging, inundations, caused, by, the, failure, of, the, grand, canal, levees, recent, works, have, allowed, floodwaters, from, shanghe, to, be, diverted, safely, out, to, sea, like, the, jiangnan, canal, the, inner, canal, is, heavily, utilized, by, barge, traffic, bringing, coal, construction, materials, and, increasingly, shipping, containers, around, jiangsu, province, this, middle, canal, section, runs, from, huai, an, to, weishan, lake, passing, through, luoma, lake, and, following, more, than, one, course, the, result, of, the, impact, of, centuries, of, yellow, river, flooding, after, pizhou, a, northerly, course, passes, through, tai, erzhuang, to, enter, weishan, lake, at, hanzhuang, bound, for, nanyang, and, jining, this, course, is, the, remnant, of, the, new, nanyang, canal, of, 1566, see, below, a, southerly, course, passes, close, by, xuzhou, and, enters, weishan, lake, near, peixian, this, latter, course, is, less, used, today, canal, is, utilized, by, barge, traffic, bringing, coal, and, construction, materials, around, northern, jiangsu, province, at, weishan, lake, both, courses, enter, shandong, province, from, here, to, linqing, the, canal, is, called, the, lu, or, shandong, canal, it, crosses, a, series, of, lakes, zhaoyang, dushan, and, nanyang, which, nominally, form, a, continuous, body, of, water, at, present, diversions, of, water, mean, that, the, lakes, are, often, largely, dry, land, north, of, the, northernmost, nanyang, lake, is, the, city, of, jining, further, on, about, 30, km, 19, mi, north, of, jining, the, highest, elevation, of, the, canal, 38, 5, m, or, 126, ft, above, sea, level, is, reached, at, the, town, of, nanwang, in, the, 1950s, a, new, canal, was, dug, to, the, south, of, the, old, summit, section, the, old, summit, section, is, now, dry, while, the, new, canal, holds, too, little, water, to, be, navigable, about, 50, km, 31, mi, further, north, passing, close, by, dongping, lake, the, canal, reaches, the, yellow, river, by, this, point, waterless, it, no, longer, connects, to, the, river, it, reappears, again, in, liaocheng, city, on, the, north, bank, where, intermittently, flowing, through, a, renovated, stone, channel, it, reaches, the, city, of, linqing, on, the, shandong, hebei, border, liangshan, county, is, the, northern, terminus, of, the, canal, for, barge, traffic, the, fifth, section, of, the, canal, extends, for, a, distance, of, 524, kilometers, 326, mi, from, linqing, to, tianjin, along, the, course, of, the, canalized, wei, river, though, one, of, the, northernmost, sections, its, name, derives, from, its, position, relative, to, tianjin, the, wei, river, at, this, point, is, heavily, polluted, while, drought, and, industrial, water, extraction, have, left, it, too, low, to, be, navigable, the, canal, now, in, hebei, province, passes, through, the, cities, of, dezhou, and, cangzhou, although, to, spectators, the, canal, appears, to, be, a, deep, waterway, in, these, city, centers, its, depth, is, maintained, by, weirs, and, the, canal, is, all, but, dry, where, it, passes, through, the, surrounding, countryside, at, its, terminus, the, canal, joins, the, hai, river, in, the, center, of, tianjin, city, before, turning, north, west, in, tianjin, the, canal, heads, northwest, for, a, short, time, following, the, course, of, the, yongding, a, tributary, of, the, hai, river, before, branching, off, toward, tongzhou, on, the, edge, of, the, municipality, of, beijing, it, is, here, that, the, modern, canal, stops, and, that, a, grand, canal, cultural, park, has, been, built, during, the, yuan, dynasty, a, further, canal, on, the, tonghui, river, connected, tongzhou, with, a, wharf, called, the, houhai, or, rear, sea, in, central, beijing, in, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, however, the, water, level, in, the, tonghui, river, dropped, and, ships, could, not, travel, from, tongzhou, to, beijing, tongzhou, then, became, the, northern, shipping, terminus, of, the, canal, cargo, was, unloaded, at, tongzhou, and, transported, to, beijing, by, land, the, tonghui, river, still, exists, as, a, wide, concrete, lined, storm, channel, and, drain, for, the, suburbs, of, beijing, the, eastern, zhejiang, canal, runs, 239, kilometers, 149, mi, across, the, coastal, plain, south, of, hangzhou, bay, in, northern, zhejiang, it, begins, at, the, qiantang, river, in, xixing, binjiang, district, hangzhou, crosses, the, cao, e, river, in, shaoxing, and, connects, to, the, yong, river, and, ports, on, the, east, china, sea, at, ningbo, this, hangzhou, ningbo, canal, began, as, the, shanyin, canal, excavated, in, shaoxing, by, the, yue, official, fan, li, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, during, china, s, spring, and, autumn, period, despite, the, difficulty, of, connecting, the, route, s, various, watersheds, the, present, route, was, completed, with, the, construction, of, the, xixing, canal, by, the, jin, official, he, xun, in, the, late, 3rd, century, ad, the, canal, was, an, important, artery, of, transport, and, supply, for, the, region, during, periods, of, disunity, in, medieval, china, and, was, particularly, prosperous, and, vital, during, the, southern, song, who, established, their, capital, at, lin, an, within, present, day, hangzhou, during, the, yuan, ming, and, qing, the, canal, diminished, in, importance, but, was, kept, navigable, until, the, development, of, railways, and, roads, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, renovation, of, the, canal, for, use, by, modern, barges, began, in, 2002, was, completed, except, for, areas, around, ningbo, by, 2009, and, was, fully, completed, in, late, 2013, in, november, 2008, the,
