yellowstone, national, park, is, a, national, park, of, the, united, states, located, in, the, northwest, corner, of, wyoming, and, extending, into, montana, and, idaho, it, was, established, by, the, 42nd, u, s, congress, with, the, yellowstone, national, park, protection, act, and, signed, into, law, by, president, ulysses, s, grant, on, march, 1, 1872, yellowstone, was, the, first, national, park, in, the, u, s, and, is, also, widely, held, to, be, the, first, national, park, in, the, world, the, park, is, known, for, its, wildlife, and, its, many, geothermal, features, especially, the, old, faithful, geyser, one, of, its, most, popular, while, it, represents, many, types, of, biomes, the, subalpine, forest, is, the, most, abundant, it, is, part, of, the, south, central, rockies, forests, ecoregion, while, native, americans, have, lived, in, the, yellowstone, region, for, at, least, 11, 000, years, aside, from, visits, by, mountain, men, during, the, early, to, mid, 19th, century, organized, exploration, did, not, begin, until, the, late, 1860s, management, and, control, of, the, park, originally, fell, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, u, s, department, of, the, interior, the, first, secretary, of, the, interior, to, supervise, the, park, being, columbus, delano, however, the, u, s, army, was, eventually, commissioned, to, oversee, the, management, of, yellowstone, for, 30, years, between, 1886, and, 1916, in, 1917, the, administration, of, the, park, was, transferred, to, the, national, park, service, which, had, been, created, the, previous, year, hundreds, of, structures, have, been, built, and, are, protected, for, their, architectural, and, historical, significance, and, researchers, have, examined, more, than, a, thousand, indigenous, archaeological, sites, yellowstone, national, park, spans, an, area, of, 3, 468, 4, sq, mi, 8, 983, km, 2, with, akes, canyons, rivers, and, mountain, ranges, yellowstone, lake, is, one, of, the, largest, high, elevation, lakes, in, north, america, and, is, centered, over, the, yellowstone, caldera, the, largest, super, volcano, on, the, continent, the, caldera, is, considered, a, dormant, volcano, it, has, erupted, with, tremendous, force, several, times, in, the, last, two, million, years, well, over, half, of, the, world, s, geysers, and, hydrothermal, features, are, in, yellowstone, fueled, by, this, ongoing, volcanism, lava, flows, and, rocks, from, volcanic, eruptions, cover, most, of, the, land, area, of, yellowstone, the, park, is, the, centerpiece, of, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, the, largest, remaining, nearly, intact, ecosystem, in, the, earth, s, northern, temperate, zone, in, 1978, yellowstone, was, named, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, hundreds, of, species, of, mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and, amphibians, have, been, documented, including, several, that, are, either, endangered, or, threatened, the, vast, forests, and, grasslands, also, include, unique, species, of, plants, yellowstone, park, is, the, largest, and, most, famous, megafauna, location, in, the, contiguous, united, states, grizzly, bears, cougars, wolves, and, free, ranging, herds, of, bison, and, elk, live, in, this, park, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, is, the, oldest, and, largest, public, bison, herd, in, the, united, states, forest, fires, occur, in, the, park, each, year, in, the, large, forest, fires, of, 1988, nearly, one, third, of, the, park, was, burnt, yellowstone, has, numerous, recreational, opportunities, including, hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and, sightseeing, paved, roads, provide, close, access, to, the, major, geothermal, areas, as, well, as, some, of, the, lakes, and, waterfalls, during, the, winter, visitors, often, access, the, park, by, way, of, guided, tours, that, use, either, snow, coaches, or, snowmobiles, the, park, contains, the, headwaters, of, the, yellowstone, river, from, which, it, takes, its, historical, name, near, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, french, trappers, named, the, river, roche, jaune, which, is, probably, a, translation, of, the, hidatsa, name, mi, tsi, a, da, zi, yellow, stone, river, later, american, trappers, rendered, the, french, name, in, english, as, yellow, stone, although, it, is, commonly, believed, that, the, river, was, named, for, the, yellow, rocks, seen, in, the, grand, canyon, of, the, yellowstone, the, native, american, name, source, is, unclear, the, human, history, of, the, park, began, at, least, 11, 000, years, ago, when, native, americans, began, to, hunt, and, fish, in, the, region, during, the, construction, of, the, post, office, in, gardiner, montana, in, the, 1950s, an, obsidian, point, of, clovis, origin, was, found, that, dated, from, approximately, 11, 000, years, ago, these, paleo, indians, of, the, clovis, culture, used, the, significant, amounts, of, obsidian, found, in, the, park, to, make, cutting, tools, and, weapons, arrowheads, made, of, yellowstone, obsidian, have, been, found, as, far, away, as, the, mississippi, valley, indicating, that, a, regular, obsidian, trade, existed, between, local, tribes, and, tribes, farther, east, when, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, entered, present, day, montana, in, 1805, they, encountered, the, nez, perce, crow, and, shoshone, tribes, who, described, to, them, the, yellowstone, region, to, the, south, but, they, chose, not, to, investigate, in, 1806, john, colter, a, member, of, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, left, to, join, a, group, of, fur, trappers, after, splitting, up, with, the, other, trappers, in, 1807, colter, passed, through, a, portion, of, what, later, became, the, park, during, the, winter, of, 1807, 1808, he, observed, at, least, one, geothermal, area, in, the, northeastern, section, of, the, park, near, tower, fall, after, surviving, wounds, he, suffered, in, a, battle, with, members, of, the, crow, and, blackfoot, tribes, in, 1809, colter, described, a, place, of, fire, and, brimstone, that, most, people, dismissed, as, delirium, the, supposedly, mystical, place, was, nicknamed, colter, s, hell, over, the, next, 40, years, numerous, reports, from, mountain, men, and, trappers, told, of, boiling, mud, steaming, rivers, and, petrified, trees, yet, most, of, these, reports, were, believed, at, the, time, to, be, a, myth, after, an, 1856, exploration, mountain, man, jim, bridger, also, believed, to, be, the, first, or, second, european, american, to, have, seen, the, great, salt, lake, reported, observing, boiling, springs, spouting, water, and, a, mountain, of, glass, and, yellow, rock, these, reports, were, largely, ignored, because, bridger, was, a, known, spinner, of, yarns, in, 1859, a, u, s, army, surveyor, named, captain, william, f, raynolds, embarked, on, a, two, year, survey, of, the, southern, central, rockies, after, wintering, in, wyoming, in, may, 1860, raynolds, and, his, party, which, included, geologist, ferdinand, v, hayden, and, guide, jim, bridger, attempted, to, cross, the, continental, divide, over, two, ocean, plateau, from, the, wind, river, drainage, in, northwest, wyoming, heavy, spring, snows, prevented, their, passage, but, had, they, been, able, to, traverse, the, divide, the, party, would, have, been, the, first, organized, survey, to, enter, the, yellowstone, region, the, american, civil, war, hampered, further, organized, explorations, until, the, late, 1860s, the, first, detailed, expedition, to, the, yellowstone, area, was, the, cook, folsom, peterson, expedition, of, 1869, which, consisted, of, three, privately, funded, explorers, the, folsom, party, followed, the, yellowstone, river, to, yellowstone, lake, the, members, of, the, folsom, party, kept, a, journal, and, based, on, the, information, it, reported, a, party, of, montana, residents, organized, the, washburn, langford, doane, expedition, in, 1870, it, was, headed, by, the, surveyor, general, of, montana, henry, washburn, and, included, nathaniel, p, langford, who, later, became, known, as, national, park, langford, and, a, u, s, army, detachment, commanded, by, lt, gustavus, doane, the, expedition, spent, about, a, month, exploring, the, region, collecting, specimens, and, naming, sites, of, interest, a, montana, writer, and, lawyer, named, cornelius, hedges, who, had, been, a, member, of, the, washburn, expedition, proposed, that, the, region, should, be, set, aside, and, protected, as, a, national, park, he, wrote, detailed, articles, about, his, observations, for, the, helena, herald, newspaper, between, 1870, and, 1871, hedges, essentially, restated, comments, made, in, october, 1865, by, acting, montana, territorial, governor, thomas, francis, meagher, who, had, previously, commented, that, the, region, should, be, protected, others, made, similar, suggestions, an, 1871, letter, to, ferdinand, v, hayden, from, jay, cooke, a, businessman, who, wanted, to, bring, tourists, to, the, region, encouraged, him, to, mention, it, in, his, official, report, of, the, survey, cooke, wrote, that, his, friend, congressman, william, d, kelley, had, also, suggested, congress, pass, a, bill, reserving, the, great, geyser, basin, as, a, public, park, forever, in, 1871, eleven, years, after, his, failed, first, effort, ferdinand, v, hayden, was, finally, able, to, explore, the, region, with, government, sponsorship, he, returned, to, the, region, with, a, second, larger, expedition, the, hayden, geological, survey, of, 1871, he, compiled, a, comprehensive, report, including, large, format, photographs, by, william, henry, jackson, and, paintings, by, thomas, moran, the, report, helped, to, convince, the, u, s, congress, to, withdraw, this, region, from, public, auction, on, march, 1, 1872, president, ulysses, s, grant, signed, the, act, of, dedication, law, that, created, yellowstone, national, park, hayden, while, not, the, only, person, to, have, thought, of, creating, a, park, in, the, region, was, its, first, and, most, enthusiastic, advocate, he, believed, in, setting, aside, the, area, as, a, pleasure, ground, for, the, benefit, and, enjoyment, of, the, people, and, warned, that, there, were, those, who, would, come, and, make, merchandise, of, these, beautiful, specimens, worrying, the, area, could, face, the, same, fate, as, niagara, falls, he, concluded, the, site, should, be, as, free, as, the, air, or, water, in, his, report, to, the, committee, on, public, lands, he, concluded, that, if, the, bill, failed, to, become, law, the, vandals, who, are, now, waiting, to, enter, into, this, wonder, land, will, in, a, single, season, despoil, beyond, recovery, these, remarkable, curiosities, which, have, required, all, the, cunning, skill, of, nature, thousands, of, years, to, prepare, hayden, and, his, 1871, party, recognized, yellowstone, as, a, unique, place, that, should, be, available, for, further, research, he, also, was, encouraged, to, preserve, it, for, others, to, see, and, experience, it, as, well, in, 1873, congress, authorized, and, funded, a, survey, to, find, a, wagon, route, to, the, park, from, the, south, which, was, completed, by, the, jones, expedition, of, 1873, eventually, the, railroads, and, sometime, after, that, the, automobile, would, make, that, possible, the, park, was, not, set, aside, strictly, for, ecological, purposes, hayden, imagined, something, akin, to, the, scenic, resorts, and, baths, in, england, germany, and, switzerland, the, act, of, dedication, an, act, to, set, apart, a, certain, tract, of, land, lying, near, the, headwaters, of, the, yellowstone, river, as, a, public, park, be, it, enacted, by, the, senate, and, house, of, representatives, of, the, united, states, of, america, in, congress, assembled, that, the, tract, of, land, in, the, territories, of, montana, and, wyoming, is, hereby, reserved, and, withdrawn, from, settlement, occupancy, or, sale, under, the, laws, of, the, united, states, and, dedicated, and, set, apart, as, a, public, park, or, pleasuring, ground, for, the, benefit, and, enjoyment, of, the, people, and, all, persons, who, shall, locate, or, settle, upon, or, occupy, the, same, or, any, part, thereof, except, as, hereinafter, provided, shall, be, considered, trespassers, and, removed, there, from, approved, march, 1, 1872, signed, by, there, was, considerable, local, opposition, to, yellowstone, national, park, during, its, early, years, some, of, the, locals, feared, that, the, regional, economy, would, be, unable, to, thrive, if, there, remained, strict, federal, prohibitions, against, resource, development, or, settlement, within, park, boundaries, and, local, entrepreneurs, advocated, reducing, the, size, of, the, park, so, that, mining, hunting, and, logging, activities, could, be, developed, to, this, end, numerous, bills, were, introduced, into, congress, by, montana, representatives, who, sought, to, remove, the, federal, land, use, restrictions, after, the, park, s, official, formation, nathaniel, langford, was, appointed, as, the, park, s, first, superintendent, in, 1872, by, the, secretary, of, interior, columbus, delano, the, first, overseer, and, controller, of, the, park, langford, served, for, five, years, but, was, denied, a, salary, funding, and, staff, langford, lacked, the, means, to, improve, the, land, or, properly, protect, the, park, and, without, formal, policy, or, regulations, he, had, few, legal, methods, to, enforce, such, protection, this, left, yellowstone, vulnerable, to, poachers, vandals, and, others, seeking, to, raid, its, resources, he, addressed, the, practical, problems, park, administrators, faced, in, the, 1872, report, to, the, secretary, of, the, interior, and, correctly, predicted, that, yellowstone, would, become, a, major, international, attraction, deserving, the, continuing, stewardship, of, the, government, in, 1874, both, langford, and, delano, advocated, the, creation, of, a, federal, agency, to, protect, the, vast, park, but, congress, refused, in, 1875, colonel, william, ludlow, who, had, previously, explored, areas, of, montana, under, the, command, of, george, armstrong, custer, was, assigned, to, organize, and, lead, an, expedition, to, montana, and, the, newly, established, yellowstone, park, observations, about, the, lawlessness, and, exploitation, of, park, resources, were, included, in, ludlow, s, report, of, a, reconnaissance, to, the, yellowstone, national, park, the, report, included, letters, and, attachments, by, other, expedition, members, including, naturalist, and, mineralogist, george, bird, grinnell, grinnell, documented, the, poaching, of, buffalo, deer, elk, and, antelope, for, hides, it, is, estimated, that, during, the, winter, of, 1874, 1875, not, less, than, 3, 000, buffalo, and, mule, deer, suffer, even, more, severely, than, the, elk, and, the, antelope, nearly, as, much, as, a, result, langford, was, forced, to, step, down, in, 1877, having, traveled, through, yellowstone, and, witnessed, land, management, problems, philetus, norris, volunteered, for, the, position, following, langford, s, exit, congress, finally, saw, fit, to, implement, a, salary, for, the, position, as, well, as, to, provide, minimal, funding, to, operate, the, park, norris, used, these, funds, to, expand, access, to, the, park, building, numerous, crude, roads, and, facilities, in, 1880, harry, yount, was, appointed, as, a, gamekeeper, to, control, poaching, and, vandalism, in, the, park, yount, had, previously, spent, decades, exploring, the, mountain, country, of, present, day, wyoming, including, the, grand, tetons, after, joining, f, v, hayden, s, geological, survey, in, 1873, yount, is, the, first, national, park, ranger, and, yount, s, peak, at, the, head, of, the, yellowstone, river, was, named, in, his, honor, these, measures, still, proved, to, be, insufficient, in, protecting, the, park, as, neither, norris, nor, the, three, superintendents, who, followed, were, given, sufficient, manpower, or, resources, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, native, american, tribes, were, effectively, excluded, from, the, national, park, under, a, half, dozen, tribes, had, made, seasonal, use, of, the, yellowstone, area, the, only, year, round, residents, were, small, bands, of, eastern, shoshone, known, as, sheepeaters, they, left, the, area, under, the, assurances, of, a, treaty, negotiated, in, 1868, under, which, the, sheepeaters, ceded, their, lands, but, retained, the, right, to, hunt, in, yellowstone, the, united, states, never, ratified, the, treaty, and, refused, to, recognize, the, claims, of, the, sheepeaters, or, any, other, tribe, that, had, used, yellowstone, the, nez, perce, band, associated, with, chief, joseph, numbering, about, 750, people, passed, through, yellowstone, national, park, in, thirteen, days, in, late, august, 1877, they, were, being, pursued, by, the, u, s, army, and, entered, the, national, park, about, two, weeks, after, the, battle, of, the, big, hole, some, of, the, nez, perce, were, friendly, to, the, tourists, and, other, people, they, encountered, in, the, park, some, were, not, nine, park, visitors, were, briefly, taken, captive, despite, joseph, and, other, chiefs, ordering, that, no, one, should, be, harmed, at, least, two, people, were, killed, and, several, wounded, one, of, the, areas, where, encounters, occurred, was, in, lower, geyser, basin, and, east, along, a, branch, of, the, firehole, river, to, mary, mountain, and, beyond, that, stream, was, named, nez, perce, creek, in, memory, of, their, trail, through, the, area, a, group, of, bannocks, entered, the, park, in, 1878, alarming, park, superintendent, philetus, norris, in, the, aftermath, of, the, sheepeater, indian, war, of, 1879, norris, built, a, fort, to, prevent, native, americans, from, entering, the, national, park, the, northern, pacific, railroad, built, a, train, station, in, livingston, montana, as, a, gateway, terminus, to, connect, to, the, northern, entrance, area, in, 1883, which, helped, to, increase, visitation, from, 300, in, 1872, to, 5, 000, in, 1883, the, spur, line, was, completed, in, fall, of, that, year, from, livingston, to, cinnabar, for, stage, connection, to, mammoth, then, in, 1902, extended, to, gardiner, station, where, passengers, also, switched, to, stagecoach, visitors, in, these, early, years, faced, poor, and, dusty, roads, plus, limited, services, with, automobiles, first, admitted, in, phases, beginning, only, in, 1915, by, 1901, a, chicago, burlington, quincy, connection, opened, via, cody, and, in, 1908, a, union, pacific, railroad, connection, to, west, yellowstone, followed, by, a, 1927, milwaukee, road, connection, to, gallatin, gateway, near, bozeman, also, motorcoaching, visitors, via, west, yellowstone, rail, visitation, fell, off, considerably, by, world, war, ii, and, ceased, regular, service, in, favor, of, the, automobile, around, the, 1960s, though, special, excursions, occasionally, continued, into, the, early, 1980s, ongoing, poaching, and, destruction, of, natural, resources, continued, unabated, until, the, u, s, army, arrived, at, mammoth, hot, springs, in, 1886, and, built, camp, sheridan, over, the, next, 22, years, as, the, army, constructed, permanent, structures, camp, sheridan, was, renamed, fort, yellowstone, on, may, 7, 1894, the, boone, and, crockett, club, acting, through, the, personality, of, george, g, vest, arnold, hague, william, hallett, phillips, w, a, wadsworth, archibald, rogers, theodore, roosevelt, and, george, bird, grinnell, were, successful, in, carrying, through, the, park, protection, act, which, saved, the, park, the, lacey, act, of, 1900, provided, legal, support, for, the, officials, prosecuting, poachers, with, the, funding, and, manpower, necessary, to, keep, a, diligent, watch, the, army, developed, its, own, policies, and, regulations, that, permitted, public, access, while, protecting, park, wildlife, and, natural, resources, when, the, national, park, service, was, created, in, 1916, many, of, the, management, principles, developed, by, the, army, were, adopted, by, the, new, agency, the, army, turned, control, over, to, the, national, park, service, on, october, 31, 1918, in, 1898, the, naturalist, john, muir, described, the, park, as, follows, however, orderly, your, excursions, or, aimless, again, and, again, amid, the, calmest, stillest, scenery, you, will, be, brought, to, a, standstill, hushed, and, awe, stricken, before, phenomena, wholly, new, to, you, boiling, springs, and, huge, deep, pools, of, purest, green, and, azure, water, thousands, of, them, are, plashing, and, heaving, in, these, high, cool, mountains, as, if, a, fierce, furnace, fire, were, burning, beneath, each, one, of, them, and, a, hundred, geysers, white, torrents, of, boiling, water, and, steam, like, inverted, waterfalls, are, ever, and, anon, rushing, up, out, of, the, hot, black, underworld, by, 1915, 1, 000, automobiles, per, year, were, entering, the, park, resulting, in, conflicts, with, horses, and, horse, drawn, transportation, horse, travel, on, roads, was, eventually, prohibited, the, civilian, conservation, corps, ccc, a, new, deal, relief, agency, for, young, men, played, a, major, role, between, 1933, and, 1942, in, developing, yellowstone, facilities, ccc, projects, included, reforestation, campground, development, of, many, of, the, park, s, trails, and, campgrounds, trail, construction, fire, hazard, reduction, and, fire, fighting, work, the, ccc, built, the, majority, of, the, early, visitor, centers, campgrounds, and, the, current, system, of, park, roads, during, world, war, ii, tourist, travel, fell, sharply, staffing, was, cut, and, many, facilities, fell, into, disrepair, by, the, 1950s, visitation, increased, tremendously, in, yellowstone, and, other, national, parks, to, accommodate, the, increased, visitation, park, officials, implemented, mission, 66, an, effort, to, modernize, and, expand, park, service, facilities, planned, to, be, completed, by, 1966, in, honor, of, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, founding, of, the, national, park, service, mission, 66, construction, diverged, from, the, traditional, log, cabin, style, with, design, features, of, a, modern, style, during, the, late, 1980s, most, construction, styles, in, yellowstone, reverted, to, the, more, traditional, designs, after, the, enormous, forest, fires, of, 1988, damaged, much, of, grant, village, structures, there, were, rebuilt, in, the, traditional, style, the, visitor, center, at, canyon, village, which, opened, in, 2006, incorporates, a, more, traditional, design, as, well, the, 1959, hebgen, lake, earthquake, just, west, of, yellowstone, at, hebgen, lake, damaged, roads, and, some, structures, in, the, park, in, the, northwest, section, of, the, park, new, geysers, were, found, and, many, existing, hot, springs, became, turbid, it, was, the, most, powerful, earthquake, to, hit, the, region, in, recorded, history, in, 1963, after, several, years, of, public, controversy, regarding, the, forced, reduction, of, the, elk, population, in, yellowstone, the, united, states, secretary, of, the, interior, stewart, udall, appointed, an, advisory, board, to, collect, scientific, data, to, inform, future, wildlife, management, of, the, national, parks, in, a, paper, known, as, the, leopold, report, the, committee, observed, that, culling, programs, at, other, national, parks, had, been, ineffective, and, recommended, the, management, of, yellowstone, s, elk, population, the, wildfires, during, the, summer, of, 1988, were, the, largest, in, the, history, of, the, park, approximately, 793, 880, acres, 3, 210, km, 2, 1, 240, sq, mi, or, 36, of, the, parkland, was, impacted, by, the, fires, leading, to, a, systematic, re, evaluation, of, fire, management, policies, the, fire, season, of, 1988, was, considered, normal, until, a, combination, of, drought, and, heat, by, mid, july, contributed, to, an, extreme, fire, danger, on, black, saturday, august, 20, 1988, strong, winds, expanded, the, fires, rapidly, and, more, than, 150, 000, acres, 610, km, 2, 230, sq, mi, burned, on, october, 1, 2013, yellowstone, national, park, closed, due, to, the, 2013, united, states, federal, government, shutdown, the, expansive, cultural, history, of, the, park, has, been, documented, by, the, 1, 000, archeological, sites, that, have, been, discovered, the, park, has, 1, 106, historic, structures, and, features, and, of, these, obsidian, cliff, and, five, buildings, have, been, designated, national, historic, landmarks, yellowstone, was, designated, an, international, biosphere, reserve, on, october, 26, 1976, and, a, un, world, heritage, site, on, september, 8, 1978, the, park, was, placed, on, the, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, from, 1995, to, 2003, due, to, the, effects, of, tourism, infection, of, wildlife, and, issues, with, invasive, species, in, 2010, yellowstone, national, park, was, honored, with, its, own, quarter, under, the, america, the, beautiful, quarters, program, justin, farrell, explores, three, moral, sensibilities, that, motivated, activists, in, dealing, with, yellowstone, first, came, the, utilitarian, vision, of, maximum, exploitation, of, natural, resources, a, characteristic, of, developers, in, the, late, 19th, century, second, was, the, spiritual, vision, of, nature, inspired, by, romanticism, and, the, transcendentalists, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, twentieth, century, saw, the, biocentric, moral, vision, that, focuses, on, the, health, of, the, ecosystem, as, theorized, by, aldo, leopold, which, led, to, the, expansion, of, federally, protected, areas, and, the, surrounding, ecosystems, the, heritage, and, research, center, is, located, at, gardiner, montana, near, the, north, entrance, to, the, park, the, center, is, home, to, the, yellowstone, national, park, s, museum, collection, archives, research, library, historian, archeology, lab, and, herbarium, the, yellowstone,

has, 110, miles, 180, km, of, shoreline, at, an, elevation, of, 7, 733, feet, 2, 357, m, above, sea, level, yellowstone, lake, is, the, largest, high, elevation, lake, in, north, america, forests, comprise, 80, percent, of, the, land, area, of, the, park, most, of, the, rest, is, grassland, the, continental, divide, of, north, america, runs, diagonally, through, the, southwestern, part, of, the, park, the, divide, is, a, topographic, feature, that, separates, the, pacific, ocean, and, atlantic, ocean, water, drainages, about, one, third, of, the, park, lies, on, the, west, side, of, the, divide, the, origins, of, the, yellowstone, and, snake, rivers, are, near, each, other, but, on, opposite, sides, of, the, divide, as, a, result, the, waters, of, the, snake, river, flow, to, the, pacific, ocean, while, those, of, the, yellowstone, find, their, way, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, park, sits, on, the, yellowstone, plateau, at, an, average, elevation, of, 8, 000, feet, 2, 400, m, above, sea, level, the, plateau, is, bounded, on, nearly, all, sides, by, mountain, ranges, of, the, middle, rocky, mountains, which, range, from, 9, 000, to, 11, 000, feet, 2, 700, to, 3, 400, m, in, elevation, the, highest, point, in, the, park, is, atop, eagle, peak, 11, 358, feet, or, 3, 462, metres, and, the, lowest, is, along, reese, creek, 5, 282, feet, or, 1, 610, metres, nearby, mountain, ranges, include, the, gallatin, range, to, the, northwest, the, beartooth, mountains, in, the, north, the, absaroka, range, to, the, east, the, teton, range, to, the, south, and, the, madison, range, to, the, west, the, most, prominent, summit, on, the, yellowstone, plateau, is, mount, washburn, at, 10, 243, feet, 3, 122, m, yellowstone, national, park, has, one, of, the, world, s, largest, petrified, forests, trees, which, were, long, ago, buried, by, ash, and, soil, and, transformed, from, wood, to, mineral, materials, this, ash, and, other, volcanic, debris, are, believed, to, have, come, from, the, park, area, itself, as, the, central, part, of, yellowstone, is, the, massive, caldera, of, a, supervolcano, the, park, contains, 290, waterfalls, of, at, least, 15, feet, 4, 6, m, the, highest, being, the, lower, falls, of, the, yellowstone, river, at, 308, feet, 94, m, three, deep, canyons, are, located, in, the, park, cut, through, the, volcanic, tuff, of, the, yellowstone, plateau, by, rivers, over, the, last, 640, 000, years, the, lewis, river, flows, through, lewis, canyon, in, the, south, and, the, yellowstone, river, has, carved, two, colorful, canyons, the, grand, canyon, of, the, yellowstone, and, the, black, canyon, of, the, yellowstone, in, its, journey, north, yellowstone, is, at, the, northeastern, end, of, the, snake, river, plain, a, great, bow, shaped, arc, through, the, mountains, that, extends, roughly, 400, miles, 640, km, from, the, park, to, the, idaho, oregon, border, the, volcanism, of, yellowstone, is, believed, to, be, linked, to, the, somewhat, older, volcanism, of, the, snake, river, plain, yellowstone, is, thus, the, active, part, of, a, hotspot, that, has, moved, northeast, over, time, the, origin, of, this, hotspot, volcanism, is, disputed, one, theory, holds, that, a, mantle, plume, has, caused, the, yellowstone, hotspot, to, migrate, northeast, while, another, theory, explains, migrating, hotspot, volcanism, as, the, result, of, the, fragmentation, and, dynamics, of, the, subducted, farallon, plate, in, earth, s, interior, the, yellowstone, caldera, is, the, largest, volcanic, system, in, north, america, and, worldwide, it, is, only, rivaled, by, the, lake, toba, caldera, on, sumatra, it, has, been, termed, a, supervolcano, because, the, caldera, was, formed, by, exceptionally, large, explosive, eruptions, the, magma, chamber, that, lies, under, yellowstone, is, estimated, to, be, a, single, connected, chamber, about, 37, miles, 60, km, long, 18, miles, 29, km, wide, and, 3, to, 7, miles, 4, 8, to, 11, 3, km, deep, the, current, caldera, was, created, by, a, cataclysmic, eruption, that, occurred, 640, 000, years, ago, which, released, more, than, 240, cu, mi, 1, 000, km, 3, of, ash, rock, and, pyroclastic, materials, this, eruption, was, more, than, 1, 000, times, larger, than, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, it, produced, a, caldera, nearly, 5, 8, mi, 1, 0, km, deep, and, 45, by, 28, miles, 72, by, 45, km, in, area, and, deposited, the, lava, creek, tuff, a, welded, tuff, geologic, formation, the, most, violent, known, eruption, which, occurred, 2, 1, million, years, ago, ejected, 588, cu, mi, 2, 450, km, 3, of, volcanic, material, and, created, the, rock, formation, known, as, the, huckleberry, ridge, tuff, and, the, island, park, caldera, a, smaller, eruption, ejected, 67, cu, mi, 280, km, 3, of, material, 1, 3, million, years, ago, forming, the, henry, s, fork, caldera, and, depositing, the, mesa, falls, tuff, each, of, the, three, climactic, eruptions, released, vast, amounts, of, ash, that, blanketed, much, of, central, north, america, falling, many, hundreds, of, miles, away, the, amount, of, ash, and, gases, released, into, the, atmosphere, probably, caused, significant, impacts, on, world, weather, patterns, and, led, to, the, extinction, of, some, species, primarily, in, north, america, a, subsequent, caldera, forming, eruption, occurred, about, 160, 000, years, ago, it, formed, the, relatively, small, caldera, that, contains, the, west, thumb, of, yellowstone, lake, since, the, last, supereruption, a, series, of, smaller, eruptive, cycles, between, 640, 000, and, 70, 000, years, ago, has, nearly, filled, in, the, yellowstone, caldera, with, 80, different, eruptions, of, rhyolitic, lavas, such, as, those, that, can, be, seen, at, obsidian, cliffs, and, basaltic, lavas, which, can, be, viewed, at, sheepeater, cliff, lava, strata, are, most, easily, seen, at, the, grand, canyon, of, the, yellowstone, where, the, yellowstone, river, continues, to, carve, into, the, ancient, lava, flows, the, canyon, is, a, classic, v, shaped, valley, indicative, of, river, type, erosion, rather, than, erosion, caused, by, glaciation, each, eruption, is, part, of, an, eruptive, cycle, that, climaxes, with, the, partial, collapse, of, the, roof, of, the, volcano, s, partially, emptied, magma, chamber, this, creates, a, collapsed, depression, called, a, caldera, and, releases, vast, amounts, of, volcanic, material, usually, through, fissures, that, ring, the, caldera, the, time, between, the, last, three, cataclysmic, eruptions, in, the, yellowstone, area, has, ranged, from, 600, 000, to, 800, 000, years, however, the, small, number, of, such, climactic, eruptions, cannot, be, used, to, make, an, accurate, prediction, for, future, volcanic, events, the, most, famous, geyser, in, the, park, and, perhaps, the, world, is, old, faithful, geyser, located, in, upper, geyser, basin, castle, geyser, lion, geyser, beehive, geyser, grand, geyser, the, world, s, tallest, predictable, geyser, giant, geyser, the, world, s, most, voluminous, geyser, riverside, geyser, and, numerous, other, geysers, are, in, the, same, basin, the, park, contains, the, tallest, active, geyser, in, the, world, steamboat, geyser, in, the, norris, geyser, basin, a, study, that, was, completed, in, 2011, found, that, at, least, 1, 283, geysers, have, erupted, in, yellowstone, of, these, an, average, of, 465, are, active, in, a, given, year, yellowstone, contains, at, least, 10, 000, geothermal, features, altogether, including, geysers, hot, springs, mudpots, and, fumaroles, over, half, of, the, world, s, geysers, and, hydrothermal, features, are, concentrated, in, yellowstone, in, may, 2001, the, u, s, geological, survey, yellowstone, national, park, and, the, university, of, utah, created, the, yellowstone, volcano, observatory, yvo, a, partnership, for, long, term, monitoring, of, the, geological, processes, of, the, yellowstone, plateau, volcanic, field, for, disseminating, information, concerning, the, potential, hazards, of, this, geologically, active, region, in, 2003, changes, at, the, norris, geyser, basin, resulted, in, the, temporary, closure, of, some, trails, in, the, basin, new, fumaroles, were, observed, and, several, geysers, showed, enhanced, activity, and, increasing, water, temperatures, several, geysers, became, so, hot, that, they, were, transformed, into, purely, steaming, features, the, water, had, become, superheated, and, they, could, no, longer, erupt, normally, this, coincided, with, the, release, of, reports, of, a, multiple, year, united, states, geological, survey, research, project, which, mapped, the, bottom, of, yellowstone, lake, and, identified, a, structural, dome, that, had, uplifted, at, some, time, in, the, past, research, indicated, that, these, uplifts, posed, no, immediate, threat, of, a, volcanic, eruption, since, they, may, have, developed, long, ago, and, there, had, been, no, temperature, increase, found, near, the, uplifts, most, recently, in, july, 2024, a, hydrothermal, explosion, occurred, in, biscuit, basin, on, march, 10, 2004, a, biologist, discovered, 5, dead, bison, which, apparently, had, inhaled, toxic, geothermal, gases, trapped, in, the, norris, geyser, basin, by, a, seasonal, atmospheric, inversion, this, was, closely, followed, by, an, upsurge, in, earthquake, activity, in, april, 2004, in, 2006, it, was, reported, that, the, mallard, lake, dome, and, the, sour, creek, dome, areas, that, have, long, been, known, to, show, significant, changes, in, their, ground, movement, had, risen, at, a, rate, of, 1, 5, to, 2, 4, inches, 3, 8, to, 6, 1, cm, per, year, from, mid, 2004, through, 2006, as, of, late, 2007, the, uplift, has, continued, at, a, reduced, rate, these, events, inspired, a, great, deal, of, media, attention, and, speculation, about, the, geologic, future, of, the, region, experts, responded, to, the, conjecture, by, informing, the, public, that, there, was, no, increased, risk, of, a, volcanic, eruption, in, the, near, future, these, changes, demonstrate, the, dynamic, nature, of, the, yellowstone, hydrothermal, system, yellowstone, experiences, thousands, of, small, earthquakes, every, year, virtually, all, of, which, are, undetectable, to, people, about, 2, 3, of, the, earthquakes, occur, in, an, area, between, hegben, lake, and, the, yellowstone, caldera, along, a, buried, fracture, zone, left, from, the, 2, 1, mya, eruption, there, have, been, six, earthquakes, with, at, least, magnitude, 6, or, greater, in, historical, times, including, the, 7, 2, magnitude, hebgen, lake, earthquake, which, occurred, just, outside, the, northwest, boundary, of, the, park, in, 1959, this, quake, triggered, a, huge, landslide, which, caused, a, partial, dam, collapse, on, hebgen, lake, immediately, downstream, the, sediment, from, the, landslide, dammed, the, river, and, created, a, new, lake, known, as, earthquake, lake, twenty, eight, people, were, killed, and, property, damage, was, extensive, in, the, immediate, region, the, earthquake, caused, some, geysers, in, the, northwestern, section, of, the, park, to, erupt, large, cracks, in, the, ground, formed, and, emitted, steam, and, some, hot, springs, that, normally, have, clear, water, turned, muddy, the, stress, created, in, the, fracture, zone, by, this, quake, is, theorized, to, be, responsible, for, the, current, quake, activity, in, the, northwestern, section, of, yellowstone, a, 6, 1, magnitude, earthquake, struck, inside, the, park, on, june, 30, 1975, but, the, damage, was, minimal, for, three, months, in, 1985, 3, 000, minor, earthquakes, were, detected, in, the, northwestern, section, of, the, park, during, what, has, been, referred, to, as, an, earthquake, swarm, and, has, been, attributed, to, minor, subsidence, of, the, yellowstone, caldera, beginning, on, april, 30, 2007, 16, small, earthquakes, with, magnitudes, up, to, 2, 7, occurred, in, the, yellowstone, caldera, for, several, days, these, swarms, of, earthquakes, are, common, and, there, have, been, 70, such, swarms, between, 1983, and, 2008, in, december, 2008, over, 250, earthquakes, were, measured, over, four, days, under, yellowstone, lake, the, largest, measuring, a, magnitude, of, 3, 9, in, january, 2010, more, than, 250, earthquakes, were, detected, over, two, days, seismic, activity, in, yellowstone, national, park, continues, and, is, reported, hourly, by, the, earthquake, hazards, program, of, the, u, s, geological, survey, on, march, 30, 2014, a, magnitude, 4, 8, earthquake, struck, almost, the, very, middle, of, yellowstone, near, the, norris, basin, at, 6, 34, am, reports, indicated, no, damage, this, was, the, largest, earthquake, to, hit, the, park, since, february, 22, 1980, yellowstone, national, park, is, the, centerpiece, of, the, 20, million, acres, 80, 940, km, 2, 31, 250, sq, mi, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, a, region, that, includes, grand, teton, national, park, adjacent, national, forests, and, expansive, wilderness, areas, in, those, forests, the, ecosystem, is, the, largest, remaining, continuous, stretch, of, mostly, undeveloped, pristine, land, in, the, contiguous, united, states, considered, the, world, s, largest, intact, ecosystem, in, the, northern, temperate, zone, with, the, successful, wolf, reintroduction, program, which, began, in, the, 1990s, much, of, the, original, faunal, and, floral, species, known, to, inhabit, the, region, when, the, first, explorers, entered, the, area, can, be, found, there, the, site, is, home, to, a, key, field, observation, site, for, the, national, ecological, observatory, network, over, 69, 000, species, of, trees, and, other, vascular, plants, are, native, to, the, park, another, 170, species, are, considered, to, be, exotic, species, and, are, non, native, of, the, eight, conifer, tree, species, documented, lodgepole, pine, forests, cover, 80, of, the, total, forested, areas, other, conifers, such, as, subalpine, fir, engelmann, spruce, rocky, mountain, douglas, fir, and, whitebark, pine, are, found, in, scattered, groves, throughout, the, park, as, of, 2007, the, whitebark, pine, is, threatened, by, a, fungus, known, as, white, pine, blister, rust, however, this, is, mostly, confined, to, forests, well, to, the, north, and, west, in, yellowstone, about, seven, percent, of, the, whitebark, pine, species, have, been, impacted, with, the, fungus, compared, to, nearly, complete, infestations, in, northwestern, montana, quaking, aspen, and, willows, are, the, most, common, species, of, deciduous, trees, the, aspen, forests, have, declined, significantly, since, the, early, 20th, century, but, scientists, at, oregon, state, university, attribute, the, recent, recovery, of, the, aspen, to, the, reintroduction, of, wolves, which, has, changed, the, grazing, habits, of, local, elk, there, are, dozens, of, species, of, flowering, plants, that, have, been, identified, most, of, which, bloom, between, may, and, september, the, yellowstone, sand, verbena, is, a, rare, flowering, plant, found, only, in, yellowstone, it, is, closely, related, to, species, usually, found, in, much, warmer, climates, making, the, sand, verbena, an, enigma, the, estimated, 8, 000, examples, of, this, rare, flowering, plant, all, make, their, home, in, the, sandy, soils, on, the, shores, of, yellowstone, lake, well, above, the, waterline, in, yellowstone, s, hot, waters, bacteria, form, mats, of, bizarre, shapes, consisting, of, trillions, of, individuals, these, bacteria, are, some, of, the, most, primitive, life, forms, on, earth, flies, and, other, arthropods, live, on, the, mats, even, in, the, middle, of, the, bitterly, cold, winters, initially, scientists, thought, that, microbes, there, gained, sustenance, only, from, sulfur, in, 2005, researchers, from, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, discovered, that, the, sustenance, for, at, least, some, of, the, diverse, hyperthermophilic, species, is, molecular, hydrogen, thermus, aquaticus, is, a, bacterium, found, in, the, yellowstone, hot, springs, that, produces, an, important, enzyme, taq, polymerase, that, is, easily, replicated, in, the, lab, and, is, useful, in, replicating, dna, as, part, of, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, process, the, retrieval, of, these, bacteria, can, be, achieved, with, no, impact, on, the, ecosystem, other, bacteria, in, the, yellowstone, hot, springs, may, also, prove, useful, to, scientists, who, are, searching, for, cures, for, various, diseases, in, 2016, researchers, from, uppsala, university, reported, the, discovery, of, a, class, of, thermophiles, hadesarchaea, in, yellowstone, s, culex, basin, these, organisms, are, capable, of, converting, carbon, monoxide, and, water, to, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, non, native, plants, sometimes, threaten, native, species, by, occupying, nutrient, resources, though, exotic, species, are, most, commonly, found, in, areas, with, the, greatest, human, visitation, such, as, near, roads, and, at, major, tourist, areas, they, have, also, spread, into, the, backcountry, generally, most, exotic, species, are, controlled, by, pulling, the, plants, out, of, the, soil, or, by, spraying, both, of, which, are, time, consuming, and, expensive, yellowstone, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, finest, megafauna, wildlife, habitat, in, the, lower, 48, states, there, are, almost, 60, species, of, mammals, in, the, park, including, the, rocky, mountain, wolf, coyote, the, canadian, lynx, cougars, and, black, and, grizzly, bears, other, large, mammals, include, the, bison, often, referred, to, as, buffalo, elk, moose, mule, deer, white, tailed, deer, mountain, goat, pronghorn, and, bighorn, sheep, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, is, the, largest, public, herd, of, american, bison, in, the, united, states, bison, once, numbered, between, 30, and, 60, million, individuals, throughout, north, america, and, yellowstone, remains, one, of, their, last, strongholds, their, populations, had, increased, from, less, than, 50, in, the, park, in, 1902, to, 4, 000, by, 2003, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, reached, a, peak, in, 2005, with, 4, 900, animals, despite, a, summer, estimated, population, of, 4, 700, in, 2007, the, number, dropped, to, 3, 000, in, 2008, after, a, harsh, winter, and, controversial, brucellosis, management, strategies, which, sent, hundreds, to, slaughter, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, is, believed, to, be, one, of, only, four, free, roaming, and, genetically, pure, herds, on, public, lands, in, north, america, the, other, three, herds, are, the, henry, mountains, bison, herd, of, utah, at, wind, cave, national, park, in, south, dakota, and, in, elk, island, national, park, in, alberta, the, relatively, large, bison, populations, are, a, concern, for, ranchers, who, fear, that, the, species, can, transmit, bovine, diseases, to, their, domesticated, cousins, about, half, of, yellowstone, s, bison, have, been, exposed, to, brucellosis, a, bacterial, disease, that, came, to, north, america, with, european, cattle, that, may, cause, cattle, to, miscarry, the, disease, has, little, effect, on, park, bison, and, no, reported, cases, of, transmission, from, wild, bison, to, domestic, livestock, have, been, filed, elk, also, carry, the, disease, and, are, believed, to, have, transmitted, the, infection, to, horses, and, cattle, to, combat, the, perceived, threat, of, brucellosis, transmission, to, cattle, national, park, personnel, regularly, corral, bison, herds, back, into, the, park, when, they, venture, outside, of, the, area, s, borders, during, the, winter, of, 1996, 1997, the, bison, herd, was, so, large, that, 1, 079, bison, that, had, exited, the, park, were, either, shot, or, sent, to, slaughter, animal, rights, activists, argue, that, this, is, a, cruel, practice, and, that, the, possibility, for, disease, transmission, is, not, as, great, as, some, ranchers, maintain, ecologists, point, out, that, the, bison, are, merely, traveling, to, seasonal, grazing, areas, that, lie, within, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, that, have, been, converted, to, cattle, grazing, some, of, which, are, within, national, forests, and, are, leased, to, private, ranchers, aphis, has, stated, that, with, vaccinations, and, other, means, brucellosis, can, be, eliminated, from, the, bison, and, elk, herds, throughout, yellowstone, starting, in, 1914, to, protect, elk, populations, the, u, s, congress, appropriated, funds, to, be, used, for, destroying, wolves, prairie, dogs, and, other, animals, injurious, to, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, on, public, lands, park, service, hunters, carried, out, these, orders, and, by, 1926, they, had, killed, 136, wolves, gradually, wolves, were, virtually, eliminated, from, yellowstone, further, exterminations, continued, until, the, national, park, service, ended, the, practice, in, 1935, with, the, passing, of, the, endangered, species, act, in, 1973, the, wolf, was, one, of, the, first, mammal, species, listed, after, the, wolves, were, extirpated, from, yellowstone, the, coyote, then, became, the, park, s, top, canine, predator, since, the, coyote, is, not, able, to, bring, down, large, animals, this, lack, of, an, apex, predator, resulted, in, a, marked, increase, in, lame, and, sick, megafauna, by, the, 1990s, the, federal, government, had, reversed, its, views, on, wolves, in, a, controversial, decision, by, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, which, oversees, threatened, and, endangered, species, northwestern, wolves, imported, from, canada, were, reintroduced, into, the, park, reintroduction, efforts, have, been, successful, with, populations, remaining, relatively, stable, a, survey, conducted, in, 2005, reported, that, there, were, 13, wolf, packs, totaling, 118, individuals, in, yellowstone, and, 326, in, the, entire, ecosystem, these, park, figures, were, lower, than, those, reported, in, 2004, but, may, be, attributable, to, wolf, migration, to, other, nearby, areas, as, suggested, by, the, substantial, increase, in, the, montana, population, during, that, interval, almost, all, the, wolves, documented, were, descended, from, the, 66, wolves, reintroduced, in, 1995, 96, the, recovery, of, populations, throughout, the, states, of, wyoming, montana, and, idaho, has, been, so, successful, that, on, february, 27, 2008, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, removed, the, northern, rocky, mountain, wolf, population, from, the, endangered, species, list, as, of, january, 2023, there, are, at, least, 108, wolves, in, the, park, in, 10, packs, wolves, in, yellowstone, sit, at, the, core, of, a, larger, population, connected, throughout, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, black, bears, are, common, in, the, park, and, were, a, park, symbol, due, to, visitor, interaction, with, the, bears, starting, in, 1910, feeding, and, close, contact, with, bears, has, not, been, permitted, since, the, 1960s, to, reduce, their, desire, for, human, foods, yellowstone, is, one, of, the, few, places, in, the, united, states, where, black, bears, can, be, seen, coexisting, with, grizzly, bears, black, bear, observations, occur, most, often, in, the, park, s, northern, ranges, and, in, the, bechler, area, which, is, in, the, park, s, southwestern, corner, as, of, 2017, an, estimated, 700, grizzly, bears, were, living, in, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, with, about, 150, grizzlies, living, wholly, or, partially, within, yellowstone, national, park, the, grizzly, was, initially, listed, as, a, threatened, species, in, the, contiguous, united, states, on, july, 28, 1975, by, the, fish, and, wildlife, service, the, grizzly, bear, was, taken, off, the, endangered, species, list, in, 2007, opponents, of, delisting, the, grizzly, expressed, concerns, that, states, might, once, again, allow, hunting, and, that, better, conservation, measures, were, needed, to, ensure, a, sustainable, population, a, federal, district, judge, overturned, the, delisting, ruling, in, 2009, reinstating, the, grizzly, the, grizzly, was, once, again, removed, from, the, list, in, 2017, in, september, 2018, a, u, s, district, judge, ruled, that, the, grizzly, s, protections, must, be, restored, in, full, arguing, the, fish, and, wildlife, service, was, mistaken, in, removing, the, bear, from, the, threatened, status, list, hunting, is, prohibited, within, yellowstone, national, park, while, hunters, may, transport, the, carcass, through, the, park, with, a, permit, population, figures, for, elk, are, more, than, 30, 000, the, largest, population, of, any, large, mammal, species, in, yellowstone, the, northern, herd, has, decreased, enormously, since, the, mid, 1990s, this, has, been, attributed, to, wolf, predation, and, causal, effects, such, as, elk, using, more, forested, regions, to, evade, predation, consequently, making, it, harder, for, researchers, to, accurately, count, them, the, northern, herd, migrates, west, into, southwestern, montana, in, the, winter, the, southern, herd, migrates, southward, and, the, majority, of, this, elk, winter, on, the, national, elk, refuge, immediately, southeast, of, grand, teton, national, park, the, southern, herd, migration, is, the, largest, mammalian, migration, remaining, in, the, u, s, outside, of, alaska, in, 2003, the, tracks, of, one, female, lynx, and, her, cub, were, spotted, and, followed, for, over, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, fecal, material, and, other, evidence, obtained, were, tested, and, confirmed, to, be, those, of, a, lynx, no, visual, confirmation, was, made, however, lynx, have, not, been, seen, in, yellowstone, since, 1998, though, dna, taken, from, hair, samples, obtained, in, 2001, confirmed, that, lynx, were, at, least, transient, to, the, park, other, less, commonly, seen, mammals, include, the, mountain, lion, and, wolverine, the, mountain, lion, has, an, estimated, population, of, only, 25, individuals, parkwide, accurate, population, figures, for, the, wolverine, are, not, known, these, uncommon, and, rare, mammals, provide, insight, into, the, health, of, protected, lands, such, as, yellowstone, and, help, managers, make, determinations, as, to, how, best, to, preserve, habitats, eighteen, species, of, fish, live, in, yellowstone, including, the, core, range, of, the, yellowstone, cutthroat, trout, a, fish, highly, sought, by, anglers, the, yellowstone, cutthroat, trout, has, faced, several, threats, since, the, 1980s, including, the, suspected, illegal, introduction, into, yellowstone, lake, of, lake, trout, an, invasive, species, which, consume, the, smaller, cutthroat, trout, although, lake, trout, were, established, in, shoshone, and, lewis, lakes, on, the, snake, river, drainage, after, u, s, government, stocking, operations, in, 1890, it, was, never, officially, introduced, into, the, yellowstone, river, drainage, the, cutthroat, trout, has, also, faced, an, ongoing, drought, as, well, as, the, accidental, introduction, of, a, parasite, whirling, disease, which, causes, a, terminal, nervous, system, disease, in, younger, fish, since, 2001, all, native, sport, fish, species, caught, in, yellowstone, waterways, are, subject, to, catch, and, release, regulations, yellowstone, is, also, home, to, seven, species, of, reptiles, including, the, painted, turtle, rubber, boa, and, prairie, rattlesnake, bullsnake, sagebrush, lizard, valley, garter, snake, and, wandering, garter, snake, and, four, species, of, amphibians, including, the, boreal, chorus, frog, tiger, salamander, western, toad, and, columbia, spotted, frog, three, hundred, eleven, species, of, birds, have, been, reported, almost, half, of, which, nest, in, yellowstone, in, 1999, twenty, six, pairs, of, nesting, bald, eagle, were, documented, extremely, rare, sightings, of, whooping, cranes, have, been, recorded, however, only, three, examples, of, this, species, are, known, to, live, in, the, rocky, mountains, out, of, 385, known, worldwide, other, birds, considered, to, be, species, of, special, concern, because, of, their, rarity, in, yellowstone, include, the, common, loon, harlequin, duck, osprey, peregrine, falcon, and, the, trumpeter, swan, as, wildfire, is, a, natural, part, of, most, ecosystems, plants, that, are, indigenous, to, yellowstone, have, adapted, in, a, variety, of, ways, douglas, fir, have, a, thick, bark, that, protects, the, inner, section, of, the, tree, from, most, fires, lodgepole, pines, the, most, common, tree, species, in, the, park, generally, have, cones, that, are, only, opened, by, the, heat, of, a, fire, their, seeds, are, held, in, place, by, a, tough, resin, and, fire, assists, in, melting, the, resin, allowing, the, seeds, to, disperse, fire, clears, out, dead, and, downed, wood, providing, fewer, obstacles, for, lodgepole, pines, to, flourish, subalpine, fir, engelmann, spruce, whitebark, pine, and, other, species, tend, to, grow, in, colder, and, moister, areas, where, the, fire, is, less, likely, to, occur, aspen, trees, sprout, new, growth, from, their, roots, and, even, if, a, severe, fire, kills, the, tree, above, ground, the, roots, often, survive, unharmed, because, they, are, insulated, from, the, heat, by, soil, the, national, park, service, estimates, that, in, natural, conditions, grasslands, in, yellowstone, burned, an, average, of, every, 20, to, 25, years, while, forests, in, the, park, would, experience, fire, about, every, 300, years, about, thirty, five, natural, forest, fires, are, ignited, each, year, by, lightning, while, another, six, to, ten, are, started, by, people, in, most, cases, by, accident, yellowstone, national, park, has, three, fire, lookout, towers, each, staffed, by, trained, firefighters, the, easiest, one, to, reach, is, atop, mount, washburn, which, has, interpretive, exhibits, and, an, observation, deck, open, to, the, public, the, park, also, monitors, fire, from, the, air, and, relies, on, visitor, reports, of, smoke, and, or, flames, fire, towers, are, staffed, almost, continuously, from, late, june, to, mid, september, the, primary, fire, season, fires, burn, with, the, greatest, intensity, in, the, late, afternoon, and, evening, few, fires, burn, more, than, 100, acres, 40, ha, and, the, vast, majority, of, fires, reach, only, a, little, over, an, acre, 0, 5, ha, before, they, burn, themselves, out, fire, management, focuses, on, monitoring, dead, and, down, wood, quantities, soil, and, tree, moisture, and, the, weather, to, determine, those, areas, most, vulnerable, to, fire, should, one, ignite, the, current, policy, is, to, suppress, all, human, caused, fires, and, to, evaluate, natural, fires, examining, the, benefit, or, detriment, they, may, pose, to, the, ecosystem, if, a, fire, is, considered, to, be, an, immediate, threat, to, people, and, structures, or, will, burn, out, of, control, then, fire, suppression, is, performed, to, minimize, the, chances, of, out, of, control, fires, and, threats, to, people, and, structures, park, employees, do, more, than, just, monitor, the, potential, for, fire, controlled, burns, are, prescribed, fires, that, are, deliberately, started, to, remove, dead, timber, under, conditions, that, allow, firefighters, an, opportunity, to, carefully, control, where, and, how, much, wood, is, consumed, natural, fires, are, sometimes, considered, prescribed, fires, if, they, are, left, to, burn, in, yellowstone, unlike, some, other, parks, there, have, been, very, few, fires, deliberately, started, by, employees, as, prescribed, burns, however, over, the, last, 30, years, over, 300, natural, fires, have, been, allowed, to, burn, naturally, in, addition, firefighters, remove, dead, and, down, wood, and, other, hazards, from, areas, where, they, will, be, a, potential, fire, threat, to, lives, and, property, reducing, the, chances, of, fire, danger, in, these, areas, fire, monitors, also, regulate, fire, through, educational, services, to, the, public, and, have, been, known, to, temporarily, ban, campfires, from, campgrounds, during, periods, of, high, fire, danger, the, common, notion, in, early, united, states, land, management, policies, was, that, all, forest, fires, were, bad, the, fire, was, seen, as, a, purely, destructive, force, and, there, was, little, understanding, that, it, was, an, integral, part, of, the, ecosystem, consequently, until, the, 1970s, when, a, better, understanding, of, wildfire, was, developed, all, fires, were, suppressed, this, led, to, an, increase, in, dead, and, dying, forests, which, would, later, provide, the, fuel, load, for, fires, that, would, be, much, harder, and, in, some, cases, impossible, to, control, the, latest, fire, management, plan, 2014, allows, natural, fires, to, burn, if, they, posed, no, immediate, threat, to, lives, and, property, the, spring, season, of, 1988, was, wet, but, by, summer, drought, began, moving, in, throughout, the, northern, rockies, creating, the, driest, year, on, record, to, that, point, grasses, and, plants, which, grew, well, in, the, early, summer, from, the, abundant, spring, moisture, produced, plenty, of, grass, which, soon, turned, to, dry, tinder, the, national, park, service, began, firefighting, efforts, to, keep, the, fires, under, control, but, the, extreme, drought, made, suppression, difficult, between, july, 15, and, 21, 1988, fires, quickly, spread, from, 8, 500, acres, 3, 400, ha, 13, 3, sq, mi, throughout, the, entire, yellowstone, region, which, included, areas, outside, the, park, to, 99, 000, acres, 40, 000, ha, 155, sq, mi, on, the, park, land, alone, by, the, end, of, the, month, the, fires, were, out, of, control, large, fires, burned, together, and, on, august, 20, 1988, the, single, worst, day, of, the, fires, more, than, 150, 000, acres, 61, 000, ha, 230, sq, mi, were, consumed, seven, large, fires, were, responsible, for, 95, of, the, 793, 000, acres, 321, 000, ha, 1, 239, sq, mi, that, were, burned, over, the, next, couple, of, months, the, cost, of, 25, 000, firefighters, and, u, s, military, forces, participating, in, the, suppression, efforts, was, 120, million, dollars, by, the, time, winter, brought, snow, that, helped, extinguish, the, last, flames, the, fires, had, destroyed, 67, structures, and, caused, several, million, dollars, in, damage, though, no, civilians, died, two, personnel, associated, with, the, firefighting, efforts, were, killed, contrary, to, media, reports, and, speculation, at, the, time, the, fires, killed, very, few, park, animals, surveys, indicated, that, only, about, 345, elk, of, an, estimated, 40, 000, 50, 000, 36, deer, 12, moose, 6, black, bears, and, 9, bison, had, perished, changes, in, fire, management, policies, were, implemented, by, land, management, agencies, throughout, the, united, states, based, on, knowledge, gained, from, the, 1988, fires, and, the, evaluation, of, scientists, and, experts, from, various, fields, by, 1992, yellowstone, had, adopted, a, new, fire, management, plan, which, observed, stricter, guidelines, for, the, management, of, natural, fires, yellowstone, s, climate, is, greatly, influenced, by, altitude, with, lower, elevations, generally, found, to, be, warmer, year, round, the, record, high, temperature, was, 99, f, 37, c, in, 2002, while, the, coldest, temperature, recorded, is, 66, f, 54, c, in, 1933, during, the, summer, months, of, june, to, early, september, daytime, highs, are, normally, in, the, 70, to, 80, f, 21, to, 27, c, range, while, nighttime, lows, can, go, to, below, freezing, 0, c, especially, at, higher, altitudes, summer, afternoons, are, frequently, accompanied, by, thunderstorms, spring, and, fall, temperatures, range, between, 30, and, 60, f, 1, and, 16, c, with, nights, in, the, teens, to, single, digits, 5, to, 20, c, winter, in, yellowstone, is, accompanied, by, high, temperatures, usually, between, 0, and, 20, f, 18, and, 7, c, and, nighttime, temperatures, below, 0, f, 18, c, for, most, of, the, winter, precipitation, in, yellowstone, is, highly, variable, and, ranges, from, 15, inches, 380, mm, annually, near, mammoth, hot, springs, to, 80, inches, 2, 000, mm, in, the, southwestern, sections, of, the, park, the, precipitation, of, yellowstone, is, greatly, influenced, by,
