on, the, northwest, by, stanislaus, national, forest, the, park, is, managed, by, the, national, park, service, and, covers, 759, 620, acres, 1, 187, sq, mi, 3, 074, km, 2, in, four, counties, centered, in, tuolumne, and, mariposa, extending, north, and, east, to, mono, and, south, to, madera, designated, a, world, heritage, site, in, 1984, yosemite, is, internationally, recognized, for, its, granite, cliffs, waterfalls, clear, streams, groves, of, giant, sequoia, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and, biological, diversity, almost, 95, percent, of, the, park, is, designated, wilderness, yosemite, is, one, of, the, largest, and, least, fragmented, habitat, blocks, in, the, sierra, nevada, its, geology, is, characterized, by, granite, and, remnants, of, older, rock, about, 10, million, years, ago, the, sierra, nevada, was, uplifted, and, tilted, to, form, its, unique, slopes, which, increased, the, steepness, of, stream, and, river, beds, forming, deep, narrow, canyons, about, one, million, years, ago, glaciers, formed, at, higher, elevations, they, moved, downslope, cutting, and, sculpting, the, u, shaped, yosemite, valley, european, american, settlers, first, entered, the, valley, in, 1851, other, travelers, entered, earlier, but, james, d, savage, is, credited, with, discovering, the, area, that, became, yosemite, national, park, native, americans, had, inhabited, the, region, for, nearly, 4, 000, years, although, humans, may, have, first, visited, as, long, as, 8, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, yosemite, was, critical, to, the, development, of, the, concept, of, national, parks, galen, clark, and, others, lobbied, to, protect, yosemite, valley, from, development, ultimately, leading, to, president, abraham, lincoln, s, signing, of, the, yosemite, grant, of, 1864, that, declared, yosemite, as, federally, preserved, land, in, 1890, john, muir, led, a, successful, movement, to, motivate, congress, to, establish, yosemite, valley, and, its, surrounding, areas, as, a, national, park, this, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, national, park, system, yosemite, draws, about, four, million, visitors, annually, most, visitors, spend, the, majority, of, their, time, in, the, valley, s, seven, square, miles, 18, km, 2, the, park, set, a, visitation, record, in, 2016, surpassing, five, million, visitors, for, the, first, time, in, 2023, the, park, saw, nearly, four, million, visitors, the, word, yosemite, derived, from, yohhe, meti, they, are, killers, in, miwok, historically, referred, to, the, name, that, the, miwok, gave, to, the, ahwahneechee, people, the, resident, indigenous, tribe, previously, the, region, had, been, called, ahwahnee, big, mouth, by, its, only, indigenous, inhabitants, the, ahwahneechee, the, term, yosemite, in, miwok, is, easily, confused, with, a, similar, term, for, grizzly, bear, and, is, still, a, common, misconception, the, indigenous, natives, of, yosemite, called, themselves, the, ahwahneechee, meaning, dwellers, in, ahwahnee, the, ahwahneechee, people, were, the, only, tribe, that, lived, within, the, park, boundaries, but, other, tribes, lived, in, surrounding, areas, together, they, formed, a, larger, indigenous, population, in, california, called, the, southern, sierra, miwok, they, are, related, to, the, northern, paiute, and, mono, tribes, other, tribes, like, the, central, sierra, miwoks, and, the, yokuts, who, both, lived, in, the, san, joaquin, valley, and, central, california, visited, yosemite, to, trade, and, intermarry, this, resulted, in, a, blending, of, culture, that, helped, preserve, their, presence, in, yosemite, after, early, american, settlements, and, urban, development, threatened, their, survival, vegetation, and, game, in, the, region, were, similar, to, modern, times, acorns, were, a, dietary, staple, as, well, as, other, seeds, and, plants, salmon, and, deer, the, 1848, 1855, california, gold, rush, was, a, major, event, impacting, the, native, population, it, drew, more, than, 90, 000, european, americans, to, the, area, in, 1849, causing, competition, for, resources, between, gold, miners, and, residents, about, 70, years, before, the, gold, rush, the, indigenous, population, was, estimated, to, be, 300, 000, quickly, dropping, to, 150, 000, and, just, ten, years, later, only, about, 50, 000, remained, the, reasons, for, such, a, decline, included, disease, birth, rate, decreases, starvation, and, conflict, the, conflict, in, yosemite, which, is, known, as, the, mariposa, war, was, part, of, the, california, genocide, which, was, the, systemic, killing, of, indigenous, peoples, throughout, the, state, between, the, 1840s, and, 1870s, it, started, in, december, 1850, when, california, funded, a, state, militia, to, drive, native, people, from, contested, territory, to, suppress, native, american, resistance, to, the, european, american, influx, yosemite, tribes, often, stole, from, settlers, and, miners, sometimes, killing, them, in, retribution, for, the, extermination, domestication, of, their, people, and, loss, of, their, lands, and, resources, the, war, and, formation, of, the, mariposa, battalion, was, partially, the, result, of, a, single, incident, involving, james, savage, a, fresno, trader, whose, trading, post, was, attacked, in, december, 1850, after, the, incident, savage, rallied, other, miners, and, gained, the, support, of, local, officials, to, pursue, a, war, against, the, natives, he, was, appointed, united, states, army, major, and, leader, of, the, mariposa, battalion, in, the, beginning, of, 1851, he, and, captain, john, boling, were, responsible, for, pursuing, the, ahwahneechee, people, led, by, chief, tenaya, and, driving, them, west, and, out, of, yosemite, in, march, 1851, under, savage, s, command, the, mariposa, battalion, captured, about, 70, ahwahneechee, and, planned, to, take, them, to, a, reservation, in, fresno, but, they, escaped, later, in, may, under, the, command, of, boling, the, battalion, captured, 35, ahwahneechee, including, chief, tenaya, and, marched, them, to, the, reservation, most, were, allowed, to, eventually, leave, and, the, rest, escaped, tenaya, and, others, fled, across, the, sierra, nevada, and, settled, with, the, mono, lake, paiutes, tenaya, and, some, of, his, companions, were, ultimately, killed, in, 1853, either, over, stealing, horses, or, a, gambling, conflict, the, survivors, of, tenaya, s, group, and, other, ahwahneechee, were, absorbed, into, the, mono, lake, paiute, tribe, accounts, from, this, battalion, were, the, first, well, documented, reports, of, european, americans, entering, yosemite, valley, attached, to, savage, s, unit, was, doctor, lafayette, bunnell, who, later, wrote, about, his, awestruck, impressions, of, the, valley, in, the, discovery, of, the, yosemite, bunnell, is, credited, with, naming, yosemite, valley, based, on, his, interviews, with, chief, tenaya, bunnell, wrote, that, chief, tenaya, was, the, founder, of, the, ahwahnee, colony, bunnell, falsely, believed, that, the, word, yosemite, meant, full, grown, grizzly, bear, after, the, mariposa, war, native, americans, continued, to, live, in, the, yosemite, area, in, reduced, numbers, the, remaining, yosemite, ahwahneechee, tribe, members, there, were, forced, to, relocate, to, a, village, constructed, in, 1851, by, the, state, government, they, learned, to, live, within, this, camp, and, their, limited, rights, adapting, to, the, changed, environment, by, entering, the, tourism, industry, through, employment, and, small, businesses, manufacturing, and, selling, goods, and, providing, services, in, 1953, the, national, park, service, banned, all, non, employee, natives, from, residing, in, the, park, and, evicted, the, non, employees, who, had, residence, in, 1969, with, only, a, few, families, left, in, the, park, the, national, park, service, evicted, the, remaining, native, people, living, within, in, the, park, all, park, employees, and, their, families, to, a, government, housing, area, for, park, employees, and, destroyed, the, village, as, part, of, a, fire, fighting, exercise, a, reconstructed, indian, village, of, ahwahnee, sits, behind, the, yosemite, museum, located, next, to, the, yosemite, valley, visitor, center, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, population, of, all, native, inhabitants, in, yosemite, was, difficult, to, determine, estimates, ranged, from, thirty, to, several, hundred, the, ahwahneechee, people, and, their, descendants, were, hard, to, identify, the, last, full, blooded, ahwahneechee, died, in, 1931, her, name, was, totuya, or, maria, lebrado, she, was, the, granddaughter, of, chief, tenaya, and, one, of, many, forced, out, of, her, ancestral, homelands, the, ahwahneechee, live, through, the, memory, of, their, descendants, their, fellow, yosemite, natives, and, through, the, yosemite, exhibit, in, the, smithsonian, and, the, yosemite, museum, as, a, method, of, self, preservation, and, resilience, the, indigenous, people, of, california, proposed, treaties, in, 1851, and, 1852, that, would, have, established, land, reservations, for, them, but, congress, refused, to, ratify, them, the, southern, sierra, miwuk, nation, is, seeking, tribal, sovereignty, and, federal, recognition, the, national, park, service, created, policies, to, protect, sacred, sites, and, allow, native, people, to, return, to, their, homelands, and, use, national, park, resources, in, 1855, entrepreneur, james, mason, hutchings, artist, thomas, ayres, and, two, others, were, the, first, tourists, to, visit, hutchings, and, ayres, were, responsible, for, much, of, yosemite, s, earliest, publicity, writing, articles, and, special, issues, about, the, valley, ayres, style, was, detailed, with, exaggerated, angularity, his, works, and, written, accounts, were, distributed, nationally, and, an, exhibition, of, his, drawings, was, held, in, new, york, city, hutchings, publicity, efforts, between, 1855, and, 1860, increased, tourism, to, yosemite, natives, supported, the, growing, tourism, industry, by, working, as, laborers, or, maids, later, they, performed, dances, for, tourists, acted, as, guides, and, sold, handcrafted, goods, notably, woven, baskets, the, indian, village, and, its, peoples, fascinated, visitors, especially, james, hutchings, who, advocated, for, yosemite, tourism, he, and, others, considered, the, indigenous, presence, to, be, one, of, yosemite, s, greatest, attractions, wawona, was, an, early, indian, encampment, for, nuchu, and, ahwahneechee, people, who, were, captured, and, relocated, to, a, reservation, on, the, fresno, river, by, savage, and, the, mariposa, battalion, in, march, 1851, galen, clark, discovered, the, mariposa, grove, of, giant, sequoia, in, wawona, in, 1857, he, had, simple, lodgings, and, roads, built, in, 1879, the, wawona, hotel, was, built, to, serve, tourists, visiting, mariposa, grove, as, tourism, increased, so, did, the, number, of, trails, and, hotels, to, build, on, it, the, wawona, tree, also, known, as, the, tunnel, tree, was, a, giant, sequoia, that, grew, in, the, mariposa, grove, it, was, 234, feet, 71, m, tall, and, was, 90, ft, 27, m, in, circumference, when, a, carriage, wide, tunnel, was, cut, through, the, tree, in, 1881, it, became, even, more, popular, as, a, tourist, photo, attraction, carriages, and, automobiles, traversed, the, road, that, passed, through, the, tree, the, tree, was, permanently, weakened, by, the, tunnel, and, it, fell, in, 1969, under, a, heavy, load, of, snow, it, was, estimated, to, have, been, 2, 100, years, old, yosemite, s, first, concession, was, established, in, 1884, when, john, degnan, and, his, wife, established, a, bakery, and, store, in, 1916, the, national, park, service, granted, a, 20, year, concession, to, the, desmond, park,

united, states, congress, passed, legislation, that, was, signed, by, president, abraham, lincoln, on, june, 30, 1864, creating, the, yosemite, grant, this, is, the, first, time, land, was, set, aside, specifically, for, preservation, and, public, use, by, the, u, s, government, and, set, a, precedent, for, the, 1872, creation, of, yellowstone, national, park, the, nation, s, first, yosemite, valley, and, the, mariposa, grove, were, ceded, to, california, as, a, state, park, and, a, board, of, commissioners, was, established, two, years, later, galen, clark, was, appointed, by, the, commission, as, the, grant, s, first, guardian, but, neither, clark, nor, the, commissioners, had, the, authority, to, evict, homesteaders, which, included, hutchings, the, issue, was, not, settled, until, 1872, when, the, homesteader, land, holdings, were, invalidated, by, the, u, s, supreme, court, clark, and, the, commissioners, were, ousted, in, a, dispute, that, reached, the, supreme, court, in, 1880, the, two, supreme, court, decisions, affecting, management, of, the, yosemite, grant, are, considered, precedents, in, land, management, law, hutchings, became, the, new, park, guardian, tourist, access, to, the, park, improved, and, conditions, in, the, valley, became, more, hospitable, tourism, significantly, increased, after, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, was, completed, in, 1869, while, the, long, horseback, ride, to, reach, the, area, was, a, deterrent, three, stagecoach, roads, were, built, in, the, mid, 1870s, to, provide, better, access, for, the, growing, number, of, visitors, john, muir, was, a, scottish, born, american, naturalist, and, explorer, muir, s, leadership, ensured, that, many, national, parks, were, left, untouched, including, yosemite, muir, wrote, articles, popularizing, the, area, and, increasing, scientific, interest, in, it, muir, was, one, of, the, first, to, theorize, that, the, major, landforms, in, yosemite, valley, were, created, by, alpine, glaciers, bucking, established, scientists, such, as, josiah, whitney, muir, wrote, scientific, papers, on, the, area, s, biology, landscape, architect, frederick, law, olmsted, emphasized, the, importance, of, conservation, of, yosemite, valley, overgrazing, of, meadows, especially, by, sheep, logging, of, giant, sequoia, and, other, damage, led, muir, to, become, an, advocate, for, further, protection, muir, convinced, prominent, guests, of, the, importance, of, putting, the, area, under, federal, protection, one, such, guest, was, robert, underwood, johnson, editor, of, century, magazine, muir, and, johnson, lobbied, congress, for, the, act, that, created, yosemite, national, park, on, october, 1, 1890, the, state, of, california, however, retained, control, of, yosemite, valley, and, mariposa, grove, muir, s, writings, raised, awareness, about, the, damage, caused, by, sheep, grazing, and, he, actively, campaigned, to, virtually, eliminate,

bill, that, shifted, control, the, national, park, service, nps, was, formed, in, 1916, and, yosemite, was, transferred, to, that, agency, s, jurisdiction, tuolumne, meadows, lodge, tioga, pass, road, and, campgrounds, at, tenaya, and, merced, lakes, were, also, completed, in, 1916, automobiles, started, to, enter, the, park, in, ever, increasing, numbers, following, the, opening, of, all, weather, highways, to, the, park, the, yosemite, museum, was, founded, in, 1926, through, the, efforts, of, ansel, franklin, hall, in, the, 1920s, the, museum, featured, native, americans, practicing, traditional, crafts, and, many, southern, sierra, miwok, continued, to, live, in, yosemite, valley, until, they, were, evicted, from, the, park, in, the, 1960s, although, the, nps, helped, create, a, museum, that, included, native, american, culture, its, early, actions, and, organizational, values, were, dismissive, of, yosemite, natives, and, the, ahwahneechee, nps, in, the, early, 20th, century, criticized, and, restricted, the, expression, of, indigenous, culture, and, behavior, for, example, park, officials, penalized, natives, for, playing, games, and, drinking, during, the, indian, field, days, of, 1924, in, 1929, park, superintendent, charles, g, thomson, concluded, that, the, indian, village, was, aesthetically, unpleasant, and, was, limiting, white, settler, development, and, ordered, the, camp, to, be, burned, down, in, 1969, many, native, residents, left, in, search, of, work, as, a, result, of, the, decline, in, tourism, nps, demolished, their, empty, houses, evicted, the, remaining, residents, and, destroyed, the, entire, village, this, was, the, last, indigenous, settlement, within, the, park, in, 1903, a, dam, in, hetch, hetchy, valley, in, the, northwestern, region, of, the, park, was, proposed, its, purpose, was, to, provide, water, and, hydroelectric, power, to, san, francisco, muir, and, the, sierra, club, opposed, the, project, while, others, including, gifford, pinchot, supported, it, in, 1913, the, o, shaughnessy, dam, was, approved, via, passage, of, the, raker, act, in, 1918, clare, marie, hodges, was, hired, as, the, first,

preservationists, persuaded, congress, to, designate, 677, 600, acres, 274, 200, ha, or, about, 89, percent, of, the, park, as, the, yosemite, wilderness, as, a, wilderness, area, it, would, be, preserved, in, its, natural, state, with, humans, being, only, temporary, visitors, in, 2016, the, trust, for, public, land, tpl, purchased, ackerson, meadow, a, 400, acre, tract, 160, ha, on, the, western, edge, of, the, park, for, 2, 3, million, ackerson, meadow, was, originally, included, in, the, proposed, 1890, park, boundary, but, never, acquired, by, the, federal, government, the, purchase, and, donation, of, the, meadow, was, made, possible, through, a, cooperative, effort, by, tpl, nps, and, yosemite, conservancy, on, september, 7, 2016, nps, accepted, the, donation, of, the, land, making, the, meadow, the, largest, addition, to, yosemite, since, 1949, with, extensive, erosion, from, years, of, cattle, ranching, the, land, is, being, transformed, back, into, a, healthy, meadow, yosemite, national, park, is, located, in, the, central, sierra, nevada, three, wilderness, areas, are, adjacent, to, yosemite, the, ansel, adams, wilderness, to, the, southeast, the, hoover, wilderness, to, the, northeast, and, the, emigrant, wilderness, to, the, north, the, 1, 189, sq, mi, 3, 080, km, 2, park, contains, thousands, of, lakes, and, ponds, 1, 600, miles, 2, 600, km, of, streams, 800, miles, 1, 300, km, of, hiking, trails, and, 350, miles, 560, km, of, roads, two, federally, designated, wild, and, scenic, rivers, the, merced, and, the, tuolumne, begin, within, yosemite, s, borders, and, flow, westward, through, the, sierra, foothills, into, the, central, valley, of, california, almost, all, of, the, landforms, are, cut, from, the, granitic, rock, of, the, sierra, nevada, batholith, a, batholith, is, a, large, mass, of, intrusive, igneous, rock, that, formed, deep, below, the, surface, about, five, percent, of, the, park, s, landforms, mostly, in, its, eastern, margin, near, mount, dana, are, metamorphosed, volcanic, and, sedimentary, rocks, these, roof, pendants, once, formed, the, roof, over, the, underlying, granitic, magma, erosion, acting, upon, different, types, of, uplift, generated, joint, and, fracture, systems, is, responsible, for, producing, the, valleys, canyons, domes, and, other, features, these, joints, and, fracture, systems, do, not, move, and, are, therefore, not, faults, spacing, between, joints, is, controlled, by, the, amount, of, silica, in, the, granite, and, granodiorite, rocks, more, silica, tends, to, form, a, more, resistant, rock, resulting, in, larger, spaces, between, joints, and, fractures, pillars, and, columns, such, as, washington, column, and, lost, arrow, are, generated, by, cross, joints, erosion, acting, on, master, joints, is, responsible, for, shaping, valleys, and, later, canyons, the, single, most, erosive, force, over, the, last, few, million, years, has, been, large, alpine, glaciers, which, turned, the, previously, v, shaped, river, cut, valleys, into, u, shaped, glacial, cut, canyons, such, as, yosemite, valley, and, hetch, hetchy, valley, exfoliation, caused, by, the, tendency, of, crystals, in, plutonic, rocks, to, expand, at, the, surface, acting, on, granitic, rock, with, widely, spaced, joints, is, responsible, for, producing, domes, such, as, half, dome, and, north, dome, and, inset, arches, like, royal, arches, yosemite, valley, represents, only, one, percent, of, the, park, area, the, tunnel, view, gives, a, view, of, the, valley, el, capitan, is, a, prominent, granite, cliff, that, looms, over, the, valley, and, is, a, rock, climbing, favorite, because, of, its, sheer, size, diverse, climbing, routes, and, year, round, accessibility, granite, domes, such, as, sentinel, dome, and, half, dome, rise, 3, 000, and, 4, 800, feet, 910, and, 1, 460, m, respectively, above, the, valley, floor, the, park, contains, dozens, of, other, granite, domes, the, high, country, of, yosemite, contains, other, important, features, such, as, tuolumne, meadows, dana, meadows, the, clark, range, the, cathedral, range, and, the, kuna, crest,

waterfalls, become, active, in, the, park, after, heavy, rains, or, melting, snowpack, park, glaciers, are, relatively, small, and, occupy, areas, that, are, in, almost, permanent, shade, such, as, north, and, northeast, facing, cirques, lyell, glacier, is, the, largest, glacier, in, yosemite, the, palisades, glaciers, are, the, largest, in, the, sierra, nevada, and, covers, 160, acres, 65, ha, none, of, the, yosemite, glaciers, are, a, remnant, of, the, ice, age, alpine, glaciers, responsible, for, sculpting, the, yosemite, landscape, instead, they, were, formed, during, one, of, the, neoglacial, episodes, that, have, occurred, since, the, thawing, of, the, ice, age, such, as, the, little, ice, age, many, yosemite, glaciers, have, disappeared, such, as, the, black, mountain, glacier, that, was, marked, in, 1871, and, had, gone, by, the, mid, 1980s, yosemite, s, final, two, glaciers, the, lyell, and, maclure, glaciers, have, receded, over, the, last, 100, years, and, are, expected, to, disappear, as, a, result, of, climate, change, yosemite, has, a, mediterranean, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, csa, meaning, most, precipitation, falls, during, the, mild, winter, and, the, other, seasons, are, nearly, dry, less, than, three, percent, of, precipitation, falls, during, the, long, hot, summers, because, of, orographic, lift, precipitation, increases,
