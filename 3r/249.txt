the, subject, of, ongoing, debate, in, puerto, rico, the, u, s, congress, and, the, united, nations, specifically, the, basic, question, is, whether, puerto, rico, should, remain, an, unincorporated, territory, of, the, u, s, become, a, u, s, state, or, become, an, independent, country, constitutionally, puerto, rico, is, subject, to, the, plenary, powers, of, the, u, s, congress, under, the, territorial, clause, of, article, iv, of, the, u, s, constitution, laws, enacted, at, the, federal, level, in, the, u, s, apply, to, puerto, rico, as, well, regardless, of, its, political, status, their, residents, do, not, have, voting, representation, in, the, u, s, congress, puerto, rico, lacks, the, full, sovereignty, of, an, independent, nation, for, example, the, power, to, manage, its, external, relations, with, other, nations, which, is, held, by, the, u, s, federal, government, the, u, s, supreme, court, has, indicated, that, once, the, u, s, constitution, has, been, extended, to, an, area, by, congress, or, the, courts, its, coverage, is, irrevocable, to, hold, that, the, political, branches, may, switch, the, constitution, on, or, off, at, will, would, lead, to, a, regime, in, which, they, not, this, court, say, what, the, law, is, puerto, ricans, were, collectively, made, u, s, citizens, in, 1917, as, a, result, of, the, jones, shafroth, act, u, s, citizens, residing, in, puerto, rico, cannot, vote, in, u, s, presidential, elections, though, both, major, parties, republican, and, democratic, hold, primary, elections, in, puerto, rico, to, choose, delegates, to, vote, on, the, parties, presidential, candidates, since, puerto, rico, is, an, unincorporated, territory, and, not, a, u, s, state, the, u, s, constitution, does, not, fully, enfranchise, u, s, citizens, residing, in, puerto, rico, only, fundamental, rights, under, the, american, federal, constitution, and, adjudications, are, applied, to, puerto, ricans, various, other, u, s, supreme, court, decisions, have, held, which, rights, apply, in, puerto, rico, and, which, ones, do, not, puerto, ricans, have, a, long, history, of, service, in, the, u, s, armed, forces, and, since, 1917, they, have, been, included, in, the, u, s, compulsory, draft, when, it, has, been, in, effect, though, the, commonwealth, government, has, its, own, tax, laws, residents, of, puerto, rico, contrary, to, a, popular, misconception, do, pay, u, s, federal, taxes, customs, taxes, which, are, subsequently, returned, to, the, puerto, rico, treasury, import, export, taxes, federal, commodity, taxes, social, security, taxes, etc, residents, pay, federal, payroll, taxes, such, as, social, security, and, medicare, as, well, as, commonwealth, of, puerto, rico, income, taxes, all, federal, employees, those, who, do, business, with, the, federal, government, puerto, rico, based, corporations, that, intend, to, send, funds, to, the, u, s, and, some, others, such, as, puerto, rican, residents, that, are, members, of, the, u, s, military, and, puerto, rico, residents, who, earned, income, from, sources, outside, puerto, rico, also, pay, federal, income, taxes, in, addition, because, the, cutoff, point, for, income, taxation, is, lower, than, that, of, the, u, s, irs, code, and, because, the, per, capita, income, in, puerto, rico, is, much, lower, than, the, average, per, capita, income, on, the, mainland, more, puerto, rico, residents, pay, income, taxes, to, the, local, taxation, authority, than, if, the, irs, code, were, applied, to, the, island, this, occurs, because, the, commonwealth, of, puerto, rico, government, has, a, wider, set, of, responsibilities, than, do, u, s, state, and, local, governments, in, 2009, puerto, rico, paid, 3, 742, billion, into, the, u, s, treasury, residents, of, puerto, rico, pay, into, social, security, and, are, thus, eligible, for, social, security, benefits, upon, retirement, they, are, excluded, from, the, supplemental, security, income, and, the, island, receives, a, smaller, fraction, of, the, medicaid, funding, it, would, receive, if, it, were, a, u, s, state, also, medicare, providers, receive, less, than, full, state, like, reimbursements, for, services, rendered, to, beneficiaries, in, puerto, rico, even, though, the, latter, paid, fully, into, the, system, puerto, rico, s, authority, to, enact, a, criminal, code, derives, from, congress, and, not, from, local, sovereignty, as, with, the, states, thus, individuals, committing, a, crime, can, only, be, tried, in, federal, or, territorial, court, otherwise, it, would, constitute, double, jeopardy, and, is, constitutionally, impermissible, in, 1992, president, george, h, w, bush, issued, a, memorandum, to, heads, of, executive, departments, and, agencies, establishing, the, current, administrative, relationship, between, the, federal, government, and, the, commonwealth, of, puerto, rico, this, memorandum, directs, all, federal, departments, agencies, and, officials, to, treat, puerto, rico, administratively, as, if, it, were, a, state, insofar, as, doing, so, would, not, disrupt, federal, programs, or, operations, many, federal, executive, branch,

which, was, saddled, with, outstanding, bond, debt, that, had, climbed, to, 70, billion, the, debt, had, been, increasing, during, a, decade, long, recession, the, commonwealth, had, been, defaulting, on, many, debts, including, bonds, since, 2015, with, debt, payments, due, the, governor, was, facing, the, risk, of, a, government, shutdown, and, failure, to, fund, the, managed, health, care, system, without, action, before, april, puerto, rico, s, ability, to, execute, contracts, for, fiscal, year, 2018, with, its, managed, care, organizations, will, be, threatened, thereby, putting, at, risk, beginning, july, 1, 2017, the, health, care, of, up, to, 900, 000, poor, u, s, citizens, living, in, puerto, rico, according, to, a, letter, sent, to, congress, by, the, secretary, of, the, treasury, and, the, secretary, of, health, and, human, services, they, also, said, that, congress, must, enact, measures, recommended, by, both, republicans, and, democrats, that, fix, puerto, rico, s, inequitable, health, care, financing, structure, and, promote, sustained, economic, growth, initially, the, oversight, board, created, under, promesa, called, for, puerto, rico, s, governor, ricardo, rossell, to, deliver, a, fiscal, turnaround, plan, by, 28, january, just, before, that, deadline, the, control, board, gave, the, commonwealth, government, until, 28, february, to, present, a, fiscal, plan, including, negotiations, with, creditors, for, restructuring, debt, to, solve, the, problems, a, moratorium, on, lawsuits, by, debtors, was, extended, to, 31, may, it, is, essential, for, puerto, rico, to, reach, restructuring, deals, to, avoid, a, bankruptcy, like, process, under, promesa, an, internal, survey, conducted, by, the, puerto, rican, economists, association, revealed, that, the, majority, of, puerto, rican, economists, reject, the, policy, recommendations, of, the, board, and, the, rossell, government, with, more, than, 80, of, economists, arguing, in, favor, of, auditing, the, debt, in, early, august, 2017, the, island, s, financial, oversight, board, created, by, promesa, planned, to, institute, two, days, off, without, pay, per, month, for, government, employees, down, from, the, original, plan, of, four, days, per, month, the, latter, had, been, expected, to, achieve, 218, million, in, savings, governor, rossello, rejected, this, plan, as, unjustified, and, unnecessary, pension, reforms, were, also, discussed, including, a, proposal, for, a, 10, reduction, in, benefits, to, begin, addressing, the, 50, billion, in, unfunded, pension, liabilities, puerto, rico, has, an, operating, budget, of, about, u, s, 9, 8, billion, with, expenses, at, about, 10, 4, billion, creating, a, structural, deficit, of, 775, million, about, 7, 9, of, the, budget, the, practice, of, approving, budgets, with, a, structural, deficit, has, been, done, for, 24, consecutive, years, starting, in, 2000, throughout, those, years, including, present, time, all, budgets, contemplated, issuing, bonds, to, cover, these, projected, deficits, rather, than, making, structural, adjustments, this, practice, increased, puerto, rico, s, cumulative, debt, as, the, government, had, already, been, issuing, bonds, to, balance, its, actual, budget, for, four, decades, beginning, in, 1973, projected, deficits, added, substantial, burdens, to, an, already, indebted, nation, which, accrued, a, public, debt, of, 71b, or, about, 70, of, puerto, rico, s, gross, domestic, product, this, sparked, an, ongoing, government, debt, crisis, after, puerto, rico, s, general, obligation, bonds, were, downgraded, to, speculative, non, investment, grade, junk, status, by, three, credit, rating, agencies, in, terms, of, financial, control, almost, 9, 6, or, about, 1, 5, billion, of, puerto, rico, s, central, government, budget, expenses, for, fy2014, is, expected, to, be, spent, on, debt, service, harsher, budget, cuts, are, expected, as, puerto, rico, must, now, repay, larger, chunks, of, debts, in, the, coming, years, for, practical, reasons, the, budget, is, divided, into, two, aspects, a, general, budget, which, comprises, the, assignments, funded, exclusively, by, the, department, of, treasury, of, puerto, rico, and, the, consolidated, budget, which, comprises, the, assignments, funded, by, the, general, budget, by, puerto, rico, s, government, owned, corporations, by, revenue, expected, from, loans, by, the, sale, of, government, bonds, by, subsidies, extended, by, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, and, by, other, funds, both, budgets, contrast, each, other, drastically, with, the, consolidated, budget, being, usually, thrice, the, size, of, the, general, budget, currently, 29b, and, 9, 0b, respectively, almost, one, out, of, every, four, dollars, in, the, consolidated, budget, comes, from, u, s, federal, subsidies, while, government, owned, corporations, compose, more, than, 31, of, the, consolidated, budget, the, critical, aspects, come, from, the, sale, of, bonds, which, comprise, 7, of, the, consolidated, budget, a, ratio, that, increased, annually, due, to, the, government, s, inability, to, prepare, a, balanced, budget, in, addition, to, being, incapable, of, generating, enough, income, to, cover, all, its, expenses, in, particular, the, government, owned, corporations, add, a, heavy, burden, to, the, overall, budget, and, public, debt, as, none, is, self, sufficient, for, example, in, fy2011, the, government, owned, corporations, reported, aggregated, losses, of, more, than, 1, 3b, with, the, puerto, rico, highways, and, transportation, authority, prhta, reporting, losses, of, 409m, the, puerto, rico, electric, power, authority, prepa, the, government, monopoly, that, controls, all, electricity, on, the, island, reporting, losses, of, 272m, while, the, puerto, rico, aqueducts, and, sewers, authority, prasa, the, government, monopoly, that, controls, all, water, utilities, on, the, island, reported, losses, of, 112m, losses, by, government, owned, corporations, have, been, defrayed, through, the, issuance, of, bonds, compounding, more, than, 40, of, puerto, rico, s, entire, public, debt, today, holistically, from, fy2000, fy2010, puerto, rico, s, debt, grew, at, a, compound, annual, growth, rate, cagr, of, 9, while, gdp, remained, stagnant, this, has, not, always, provided, a, long, term, solution, in, early, july, 2017, for, example, the, prepa, power, authority, was, effectively, bankrupt, after, defaulting, in, a, plan, to, restructure, 9, billion, in, bond, debt, the, agency, planned, to, seek, court, protection, the, cost, of, living, in, puerto, rico, is, high, and, has, increased, over, the, past, decade, statistics, used, for, cost, of, living, sometimes, do, not, take, into, account, certain, costs, such, as, the, high, cost, of, electricity, which, has, hovered, in, the, 24, to, 30, range, per, kilowatt, hour, two, to, three, times, the, national, average, increased, travel, costs, for, longer, flights, additional, shipping, fees, and, the, loss, of, promotional, participation, opportunities, for, customers, outside, the, continental, united, states, while, some, online, stores, do, offer, free, shipping, on, orders, to, puerto, rico, many, merchants, exclude, hawaii, alaska, puerto, rico, and, other, u, s, territories, the, household, median, income, is, stated, as, 19, 350, and, the, mean, income, as, 30, 463, in, the, u, s, census, bureau, s, 2015, update, the, report, also, indicates, that, 45, 5, of, individuals, are, below, the, poverty, level, the, median, home, value, in, puerto, rico, ranges, from, u, s, 100, 000, to, u, s, 214, 000, while, the, national, median, home, value, sits, at, 119, 600, one, of, the, most, cited, contributors, to, the, high, cost, of, living, in, puerto, rico, is, the, merchant, marine, act, of, 1920, also, known, as, the, jones, act, which, prevents, foreign, flagged, ships, from, carrying, cargo, between, two, american, ports, a, practice, known, as, cabotage, because, of, the, jones, act, foreign, ships, inbound, with, goods, from, central, and, south, america, western, europe, and, africa, cannot, stop, in, puerto, rico, offload, puerto, rico, bound, goods, load, mainland, bound, puerto, rico, manufactured, goods, and, continue, to, u, s, ports, instead, they, must, proceed, directly, to, u, s, ports, where, distributors, break, bulk, and, send, puerto, rico, bound, manufactured, goods, to, puerto, rico, across, the, ocean, by, u, s, flagged, ships, the, local, government, of, puerto, rico, has, requested, several, times, to, the, u, s, congress, to, exclude, puerto, rico, from, the, jones, act, restrictions, without, success, in, 2013, the, government, accountability, office, published, a, report, which, concluded, that, repealing, or, amending, the, jones, act, cabotage, law, might, cut, puerto, rico, shipping, costs, and, that, shippers, believed, that, opening, the, trade, to, non, u, s, flag, competition, could, lower, costs, ultimately, the, report, concluded, that, effects, of, modifying, the, application, of, the, jones, act, for, puerto, rico, are, highly, uncertain, for, both, puerto, rico, and, the, u, s, particularly, for, the, u, s, shipping, industry, and, the, military, preparedness, of, the, u, s, a, 2018, study, by, economists, at, boston, based, reeve, associates, and, puerto, rico, based, estudios, tecnicos, has, concluded, that, the, 1920, jones, act, has, no, impact, on, either, retail, prices, or, the, cost,

spanish, spoken, elsewhere, puerto, rican, spanish, utilizes, many, ta, no, words, as, well, as, english, words, the, largest, influence, on, the, spanish, spoken, in, puerto, rico, is, that, of, the,
