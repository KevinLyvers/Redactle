the, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, a, continental, glacier, covering, 98, of, the, antarctic, continent, with, an, area, of, 14, million, square, kilometres, 5, 4, million, square, miles, and, an, average, thickness, of, over, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, it, is, the, largest, of, earth, s, two, current, ice, sheets, containing, 26, 5, million, cubic, kilometres, 6, 400, 000, cubic, miles, of, ice, which, is, equivalent, to, 61, of, all, fresh, water, on, earth, its, surface, is, nearly, continuous, and, the, only, ice, free, areas, on, the, continent, are, the, dry, valleys, nunataks, of, the, antarctic, mountain, ranges, and, sparse, coastal, bedrock, however, it, is, often, subdivided, into, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, eais, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, wais, and, antarctic, peninsula, ap, due, to, the, large, differences, in, topography, ice, flow, and, glacier, mass, balance, between, the, three, regions, because, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, over, 10, times, larger, than, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, and, located, at, a, higher, elevation, it, is, less, vulnerable, to, climate, change, than, the, wais, in, the, 20th, century, eais, had, been, one, of, the, only, places, on, earth, which, displayed, limited, cooling, instead, of, warming, even, as, the, wais, warmed, by, over, 0, 1, c, decade, from, 1950s, to, 2000, with, an, average, warming, trend, of, 0, 05, c, decade, since, 1957, across, the, whole, continent, as, of, early, 2020s, there, is, still, net, mass, gain, over, the, eais, due, to, increased, precipitation, freezing, on, top, of, the, ice, sheet, yet, the, ice, loss, from, the, wais, glaciers, such, as, thwaites, and, pine, island, glacier, is, far, greater, by, 2100, net, ice, loss, from, antarctica, alone, would, add, around, 11, cm, 5, in, to, the, global, sea, level, rise, further, the, way, wais, is, located, deep, below, the, sea, level, leaves, it, vulnerable, to, marine, ice, sheet, instability, which, is, difficult, to, simulate, in, ice, sheet, models, if, instability, is, triggered, before, 2100, it, has, the, potential, to, increase, total, sea, level, rise, caused, by, antarctica, by, tens, of, centimeters, more, particularly, with, high, overall, warming, ice, loss, from, antarctica, also, generates, fresh, meltwater, at, a, rate, of, 1100, 1500, billion, tons, gt, per, year, this, meltwater, dilutes, the, saline, antarctic, bottom, water, which, weakens, the, lower, cell, of, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, and, may, even, contribute, to, its, collapse, although, this, will, likely, take, place, over, multiple, centuries, paleoclimate, research, and, improved, modelling, show, that, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, very, likely, to, disappear, even, if, the, warming, does, not, progress, any, further, and, only, reducing, the, warming, to, 2, c, 3, 6, f, below, the, temperature, of, 2020, may, save, it, it, is, believed, that, the, loss, of, the, ice, sheet, would, take, between, 2, 000, and, 13, 000, years, although, several, centuries, of, high, emissions, may, shorten, this, to, 500, years, 3, 3, m, 10, ft, 10, in, of, sea, level, rise, would, occur, if, the, ice, sheet, collapses, but, leaves, ice, caps, on, the, mountains, behind, and, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, 1, in, if, those, melt, as, well, isostatic, rebound, may, also, add, around, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, the, global, sea, levels, over, another, 1, 000, years, on, the, other, hand, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, far, more, stable, and, may, only, cause, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, 0, 9, m, 2, ft, 11, in, of, sea, level, rise, from, the, current, level, of, warming, which, is, a, small, fraction, of, the, 53, 3, m, 175, ft, contained, in, the, full, ice, sheet, around, 3, c, 5, 4, f, vulnerable, locations, like, wilkes, basin, and, aurora, basin, may, collapse, over, a, period, of, around, 2, 000, years, which, would, add, up, to, 6, 4, m, 21, ft, 0, in, to, sea, levels, the, loss, of, the, entire, ice, sheet, would, require, global, warming, in, a, range, between, 5, c, 9, 0, f, and, 10, c, 18, f, and, a, minimum, of, 10, 000, years, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, covers, an, area, of, almost, 14, million, square, kilometres, 5, 4, million, square, miles, and, contains, 26, 5, million, cubic, kilometres, 6, 400, 000, cubic, miles, of, ice, a, cubic, kilometer, of, ice, weighs, approximately, 0, 92, metric, gigatonnes, meaning, that, the, ice, sheet, weighs, about, 24, 380, 000, gigatonnes, this, ice, is, equivalent, to, around, 61, of, all, fresh, water, on, earth, the, only, other, currently, existing, ice, sheet, on, earth, is, the, greenland, ice, sheet, in, the, arctic, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, divided, by, the, transantarctic, mountains, into, two, unequal, sections, called, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, eais, and, the, smaller, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, wais, some, glaciologists, consider, ice, cover, over, the, relatively, small, antarctic, peninsula, also, in, west, antarctica, to, be, the, third, ice, sheet, in, antarctica, 2234, in, part, because, its, drainage, basins, are, very, distinct, from, the, wais, collectively, these, ice, sheets, have, an, average, thickness, of, around, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, even, the, transantarctic, mountains, are, largely, covered, by, ice, with, only, some, mountain, summits, and, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, being, ice, free, in, the, present, some, coastal, areas, also, have, exposed, bedrock, that, is, not, covered, by, ice, during, the, late, cenozoic, ice, age, many, of, those, areas, had, been, covered, by, ice, as, well, the, eais, rests, on, a, major, land, mass, but, the, bed, of, the, wais, is, in, places, more, than, 2, 500, meters, 8, 200, feet, below, sea, level, it, would, be, seabed, if, the, ice, sheet, were, not, there, the, wais, is, classified, as, a, marine, based, ice, sheet, meaning, that, its, bed, lies, below, sea, level, and, its, edges, flow, into, floating, ice, shelves, the, wais, is, bounded, by, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, and, outlet, glaciers, that, drain, into, the, amundsen, sea, thwaites, glacier, and, pine, island, glacier, are, the, two, most, important, outlet, glaciers, antarctica, is, the, coldest, and, driest, continent, on, earth, as, well, as, the, one, with, the, highest, average, elevation, because, antarctica, is, so, dry, there, is, little, water, vapor, so, its, air, doesn, t, conduct, heat, well, further, it, is, surrounded, by, the, southern, ocean, which, is, far, more, effective, at, absorbing, heat, than, any, other, ocean, it, also, has, extensive, year, around, sea, ice, which, has, a, high, albedo, reflectivity, and, adds, to, the, albedo, of, the, ice, s, sheet, own, bright, white, surface, antarctica, is, so, cold, that, it, is, the, only, place, on, earth, where, atmospheric, temperature, inversion, occurs, every, winter, elsewhere, the, atmosphere, on, earth, is, at, its, warmest, near, the, surface, and, it, becomes, cooler, as, elevation, increases, during, the, antarctic, winter, the, surface, of, central, antarctica, instead, becomes, cooler, than, middle, layers, of, the, atmosphere, this, means, that, greenhouse, gases, trap, heat, in, the, middle, atmosphere, and, reduce, its, flow, towards, the, surface, and, towards, space, instead, of, simply, preventing, the, flow, of, heat, from, the, lower, atmosphere, to, the, upper, layers, this, effect, lasts, until, the, end, of, the, antarctic, winter, thus, even, the, early, climate, models, predicted, that, temperature, trends, over, antarctica, would, emerge, slower, and, be, more, subtle, than, they, are, elsewhere, moreover, there, were, fewer, than, twenty, permanent, weather, stations, across, the, continent, with, only, two, in, the, continent, s, interior, while, automatic, weather, stations, were, deployed, relatively, late, and, their, observational, record, was, brief, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, likewise, satellite, temperature, measurements, did, not, begin, until, 1981, and, are, typically, limited, to, cloud, free, conditions, thus, datasets, representing, the, entire, continent, only, began, to, appear, by, the, very, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, only, exception, was, the, antarctic, peninsula, where, warming, was, both, well, documented, and, strongly, pronounced, it, was, eventually, found, to, have, warmed, by, 3, c, 5, 4, f, since, the, mid, 20th, century, based, on, this, limited, data, several, papers, published, in, the, early, 2000s, suggested, that, there, had, been, an, overall, cooling, over, continental, antarctica, that, is, outside, of, the, peninsula, a, 2002, analysis, led, by, peter, doran, received, widespread, media, coverage, after, it, also, indicated, stronger, cooling, than, warming, between, 1966, and, 2000, and, found, that, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, in, east, antarctica, had, experienced, cooling, of, 0, 7, c, per, decade, a, local, trend, confirmed, by, subsequent, research, at, mcmurdo, multiple, journalists, suggested, that, these, findings, were, contradictory, to, global, warming, even, though, the, paper, itself, noted, the, limited, data, and, still, found, warming, over, 42, of, the, continent, what, became, known, as, the, antarctic, cooling, controversy, received, further, attention, in, 2004, when, michael, crichton, wrote, a, novel, state, of, fear, which, alleged, a, conspiracy, amongst, climate, scientists, to, make, up, global, warming, and, claimed, that, doran, s, study, definitively, proved, there, was, no, warming, in, antarctica, outside, of, the, peninsula, relatively, few, scientists, responded, to, the, book, at, the, time, but, it, was, subsequently, brought, up, in, a, 2006, us, senate, hearing, in, support, of, climate, change, denial, and, peter, doran, felt, compelled, to, publish, a, statement, in, the, new, york, times, decrying, the, misinterpretation, of, his, work, the, british, antarctic, survey, and, nasa, also, issued, statements, affirming, the, strength, of, climate, science, after, the, hearing, by, 2009, research, was, finally, able, to, combine, historical, weather, station, data, with, satellite, measurements, to, create, consistent, temperature, records, going, back, to, 1957, which, demonstrated, warming, of, 0, 05, c, decade, since, 1957, across, the, continent, with, cooling, in, east, antarctica, offset, by, the, average, temperature, increase, of, at, least, 0, 176, 0, 06, c, per, decade, in, west, antarctica, subsequent, research, confirmed, clear, warming, over, west, antarctica, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, only, uncertainty, being, the, magnitude, over, 2012, 2013, estimates, based, on, wais, divide, ice, cores, and, the, revised, byrd, station, temperature, record, even, suggested, a, much, larger, west, antarctica, warming, of, 2, 4, c, 4, 3, f, since, 1958, or, around, 0, 46, c, 0, 83, f, per, decade, although, there, has, been, some, uncertainty, about, it, in, 2022, a, study, narrowed, the, warming, of, the, central, area, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, between, 1959, and, 2000, to, 0, 31, c, 0, 56, f, per, decade, and, conclusively, attributed, it, to, increases, in, greenhouse, gas, concentrations, caused, by, human, activity, local, changes, in, atmospheric, circulation, patterns, like, the, interdecadal, pacific, oscillation, or, the, southern, annular, mode, slowed, or, even, partially, reversed, the, warming, of, west, antarctica, between, 2000, and, 2020, with, the, antarctic, peninsula, experiencing, cooling, from, 2002, while, a, variability, in, those, patterns, is, natural, ozone, depletion, had, also, led, the, southern, annular, mode, sam, to, be, stronger, than, it, had, been, in, the, past, 600, years, of, observations, studies, predicted, a, reversal, in, the, sam, once, the, ozone, layer, began, to, recover, following, the, montreal, protocol, starting, from, 2002, and, these, changes, were, consistent, with, their, predictions, as, these, patterns, reversed, the, east, antarctica, interior, demonstrated, clear, warming, over, those, two, decades, in, particular, the, south, pole, warmed, by, 0, 61, 0, 34, c, per, decade, between, 1990, and, 2020, which, is, three, times, the, global, average, the, antarctica, wide, warming, trend, also, continued, after, 2000, and, in, february, 2020, the, continent, recorded, its, highest, temperature, of, 18, 3, c, which, was, a, degree, higher, than, the, previous, record, of, 17, 5, c, in, march, 2015, by, 2100, net, ice, loss, from, antarctica, alone, is, expected, to, add, about, 11, cm, 5, in, to, global, sea, level, rise, 1270, other, processes, may, cause, west, antarctica, to, contribute, more, to, sea, level, rise, one, such, process, is, marine, ice, sheet, instability, which, describes, the, potential, for, warm, water, currents, to, enter, between, the, seafloor, and, the, base, of, the, ice, sheet, once, the, sheet, is, no, longer, heavy, enough, to, displace, such, flows, another, potential, process, is, marine, ice, cliff, instability, when, ice, cliffs, with, heights, greater, than, 100, m, 330, ft, may, collapse, under, their, own, weight, once, they, are, no, longer, buttressed, by, ice, shelves, this, process, has, never, been, observed, and, it, only, occurs, in, some, models, such, processes, may, increase, sea, level, rise, caused, by, antarctica, to, 41, cm, 16, in, by, 2100, under, the, low, emission, scenario, and, 57, cm, 22, in, under, the, high, emission, scenario, 1270, ice, loss, from, antarctica, also, generates, more, fresh, meltwater, at, a, rate, of, 1100, 1500, billion, tons, gt, per, year, 1240, this, meltwater, then, mixes, back, into, the, southern, ocean, which, makes, its, water, fresher, this, freshening, of, the, southern, ocean, results, in, increased, stratification, and, stabilization, of, its, layers, 1240, and, this, has, the, single, largest, impact, on, the, long, term, properties, of, southern, ocean, circulation, these, changes, in, the, southern, ocean, cause, the, upper, cell, circulation, to, speed, up, accelerating, the, flow, of, major, currents, while, the, lower, cell, circulation, slows, down, as, it, is, dependent, on, the, highly, saline, antarctic, bottom, water, which, already, appears, to, have, been, observably, weakened, by, the, freshening, in, spite, of, the, limited, recovery, during, 2010s, 1240, since, the, 1970s, the, upper, cell, has, strengthened, by, 3, 4, sverdrup, sv, represents, a, flow, of, 1, million, cubic, meters, per, second, or, 50, 60, of, its, flow, while, the, lower, cell, has, weakened, by, a, similar, amount, but, because, of, its, larger, volume, these, changes, represent, a, 10, 20, weakening, while, these, effects, weren, t, fully, caused, by, climate, change, with, some, role, played, by, the, natural, cycle, of, interdecadal, pacific, oscillation, they, are, likely, to, worsen, in, the, future, as, of, early, 2020s, climate, models, best, limited, confidence, estimate, is, that, the, lower, cell, would, continue, to, weaken, while, the, upper, cell, may, strengthen, by, around, 20, over, the, 21st, century, a, key, reason, for, the, uncertainty, is, limited, certainty, about, future, ice, loss, from, antarctica, and, the, poor, and, inconsistent, representation, of, ocean, stratification, in, even, the, cmip6, models, the, most, advanced, generation, available, as, of, early, 2020s, one, study, suggests, that, the, circulation, would, lose, half, its, strength, by, 2050, under, the, worst, climate, change, scenario, with, greater, losses, occurring, afterwards, it, is, possible, that, the, south, ocean, overturning, circulation, may, not, simply, continue, to, weaken, in, response, to, increased, warming, and, freshening, but, will, eventually, collapse, outright, in, a, way, which, would, be, difficult, to, reverse, and, constitute, an, example, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, this, would, be, similar, to, some, projections, for, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, which, is, also, affected, by, the, ocean, warming, and, by, meltwater, flows, from, the, declining, greenland, ice, sheet, however, southern, hemisphere, is, only, inhabited, by, 10, of, the, world, s, population, and, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, has, historically, received, much, less, attention, than, the, amoc, some, preliminary, research, suggests, that, such, a, collapse, may, become, likely, once, global, warming, reaches, levels, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 3, c, 5, 4, f, but, there, is, far, less, certainty, than, with, the, estimates, for, most, other, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, even, if, initiated, in, the, near, future, the, circulation, s, collapse, is, unlikely, to, be, complete, until, close, to, 2300, similarly, impacts, such, as, the, reduction, in, precipitation, in, the, southern, hemisphere, with, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, north, or, a, decline, of, fisheries, in, the, southern, ocean, with, a, potential, collapse, of, certain, marine, ecosystems, are, also, expected, to, unfold, over, multiple, centuries, sea, level, rise, will, continue, well, after, 2100, but, potentially, at, very, different, rates, according, to, the, most, recent, reports, of, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, srocc, and, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, there, will, be, a, median, rise, of, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, and, maximum, rise, of, 37, cm, 15, in, under, the, low, emission, scenario, on, the, other, hand, the, highest, emission, scenario, results, in, a, median, rise, of, 1, 46, m, 5, ft, metres, with, a, minimum, of, 60, cm, 2, ft, and, a, maximum, of, 2, 89, m, 9, 1, 2, ft, over, even, longer, timescales, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, which, is, much, smaller, than, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, and, grounded, deep, below, the, sea, level, is, considered, highly, vulnerable, the, melting, of, all, the, ice, in, west, antarctica, would, increase, the, total, sea, level, rise, to, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, 1, in, mountain, ice, caps, not, in, contact, with, water, are, less, vulnerable, than, the, majority, of, the, ice, sheet, which, is, located, below, the, sea, level, the, collapse, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, would, cause, 3, 3, m, 10, ft, 10, in, of, sea, level, rise, this, kind, of, collapse, is, now, considered, practically, inevitable, because, it, appears, to, have, already, occurred, during, the, eemian, period, 125, 000, years, ago, when, temperatures, were, similar, to, the, early, 21st, century, the, amundsen, sea, also, appears, to, be, warming, at, rates, which, would, make, the, ice, sheet, s, collapse, effectively, inevitable, the, only, way, to, reverse, ice, loss, from, west, antarctica, once, triggered, is, by, lowering, the, global, temperature, to, 1, c, 1, 8, f, below, the, preindustrial, level, this, would, be, 2, c, 3, 6, f, below, the, temperature, of, 2020, other, researchers, suggested, that, a, climate, engineering, intervention, to, stabilize, the, ice, sheet, s, glaciers, may, delay, its, loss, by, centuries, and, give, more, time, to, adapt, this, is, an, uncertain, proposal, and, would, end, up, as, one, of, the, most, expensive, projects, ever, attempted, otherwise, the, disappearance, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, would, take, an, estimated, 2000, years, the, absolute, minimum, for, the, loss, of, west, antarctica, ice, is, 500, years, and, the, potential, maximum, is, 13, 000, years, once, the, ice, sheet, is, lost, the, isostatic, rebound, of, the, land, previously, covered, by, the, ice, sheet, would, result, in, an, additional, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, of, sea, level, rise, over, the, following, 1000, years, if, global, warming, were, to, reach, higher, levels, then, the, eais, would, play, an, increasingly, larger, role, in, sea, level, rise, occurring, after, 2100, according, to, the, most, recent, reports, of, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, srocc, and, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, the, most, intense, climate, change, scenario, where, the, anthropogenic, emissions, increase, continuously, rcp8, 5, would, result, in, antarctica, alone, losing, a, median, of, 1, 46, m, 4, ft, 9, in, confidence, interval, between, 60, cm, 2, 0, ft, and, 2, 89, m, 9, ft, 6, in, by, 2300, which, would, involve, some, loss, from, the, eais, in, addition, to, the, erosion, of, the, wais, this, antarctica, only, sea, level, rise, would, be, in, addition, to, ice, losses, from, the, greenland, ice, sheet, and, mountain, glaciers, as, well, as, the, thermal, expansion, of, ocean, water, if, the, warming, were, to, remain, at, elevated, levels, for, a, long, time, then, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, would, eventually, become, the, dominant, contributor, to, sea, level, rise, simply, because, it, contains, the, largest, amount, of, ice, sustained, ice, loss, from, the, eais, would, begin, with, the, significant, erosion, of, the, so, called, subglacial, basins, such, as, totten, glacier, and, wilkes, basin, which, are, located, in, vulnerable, locations, below, the, sea, level, evidence, from, the, pleistocene, shows, that, wilkes, basin, had, likely, lost, enough, ice, to, add, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, to, sea, levels, between, 115, 000, and, 129, 000, years, ago, during, the, eemian, and, about, 0, 9, m, 2, ft, 11, in, between, 318, 000, and, 339, 000, years, ago, during, the, marine, isotope, stage, 9, neither, wilkes, nor, the, other, subglacial, basins, were, lost, entirely, but, estimates, suggest, that, they, would, be, committed, to, disappearance, once, the, global, warming, reaches, 3, c, 5, 4, f, the, plausible, temperature, range, is, between, 2, c, 3, 6, f, and, 6, c, 11, f, then, the, subglacial, basins, would, gradually, collapse, over, a, period, of, around, 2, 000, years, although, it, may, be, as, fast, as, 500, years, or, as, slow, as, 10, 000, years, their, loss, would, ultimately, add, between, 1, 4, m, 4, ft, 7, in, and, 6, 4, m, 21, ft, 0, in, to, sea, levels, depending, on, the, ice, sheet, model, used, isostatic, rebound, of, the, newly, ice, free, land, would, also, add, 8, cm, 3, 1, in, and, 57, cm, 1, ft, 10, in, respectively, the, entire, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, holds, enough, ice, to, raise, global, sea, levels, by, 53, 3, m, 175, ft, its, complete, melting, is, also, possible, but, it, would, require, very, high, warming, and, a, lot, of, time, in, 2022, an, extensive, assessment, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, published, in, science, magazine, concluded, that, the, ice, sheet, would, take, a, minimum, of, 10, 000, years, to, fully, melt, it, would, most, likely, be, committed, to, complete, disappearance, only, once, the, global, warming, reaches, about, 7, 5, c, 13, 5, f, with, the, minimum, and, the, maximum, range, between,
