000, by, 1901, montreal, was, the, capital, of, the, province, of, canada, from, 1844, to, 1849, but, lost, its, status, when, a, tory, mob, burnt, down, the, parliament, building, to, protest, the, passage, of, the, rebellion, losses, bill, thereafter, the, capital, rotated, between, quebec, city, and, toronto, until, in, 1857, queen, victoria, herself, established, ottawa, as, the, capital, due, to, strategic, reasons, the, reasons, were, twofold, first, because, it, was, located, more, in, the, interior, of, the, province, of, canada, it, was, less, susceptible, to, attack, from, the, united, states, second, and, perhaps, more, importantly, because, it, lay, on, the, border, between, french, and, english, canada, ottawa, was, seen, as, a, compromise, between, montreal, toronto, kingston, and, quebec, city, which, were, all, vying, to, become, the, young, nation, s, official, capital, ottawa, retained, the, status, as, capital, of, canada, when, the, province, of, canada,

already, surpassed, that, traded, at, the, montreal, stock, exchange, in, the, 1940s, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, opened, in, 1959, allowing, vessels, to, bypass, montreal, in, time, this, development, led, to, the, end, of, the, city, s, economic, dominance, as, businesses, moved, to, other, areas, during, the, 1960s, there, was, continued, growth, as, canada, s, tallest, skyscrapers,

1970s, ushered, in, a, period, of, wide, ranging, social, and, political, changes, stemming, largely, from, the, concerns, of, the, french, speaking, majority, about, the, conservation, of, their,
