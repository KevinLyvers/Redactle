the, river, thames, t, m, z, temz, known, alternatively, in, parts, as, the, river, isis, is, a, river, that, flows, through, southern, england, including, london, at, 346, kilometres, 215, mi, it, is, the, longest, river, entirely, in, england, and, the, second, longest, in, the, united, kingdom, after, the, river, severn, the, river, rises, at, thames, head, in, gloucestershire, and, flows, into, the, north, sea, near, tilbury, essex, and, gravesend, kent, via, the, thames, estuary, from, the, west, it, flows, through, oxford, where, it, is, sometimes, called, the, isis, reading, henley, on, thames, and, windsor, the, thames, also, drains, the, whole, of, greater, london, the, lower, reaches, of, the, river, are, called, the, tideway, derived, from, its, long, tidal, reach, up, to, teddington, lock, its, tidal, section, includes, most, of, its, london, stretch, and, has, a, rise, and, fall, of, 7, metres, 23, ft, from, oxford, to, the, estuary, the, thames, drops, by, 55, metres, 180, ft, running, through, some, of, the, drier, parts, of, mainland, britain, and, heavily, abstracted, for, drinking, water, the, thames, discharge, is, low, considering, its, length, and, breadth, the, severn, has, a, discharge, almost, twice, as, large, on, average, despite, having, a, smaller, drainage, basin, in, scotland, the, tay, achieves, more, than, double, the, thames, average, discharge, from, a, drainage, basin, that, is, 60, smaller, along, its, course, are, 45, navigation, locks, with, accompanying, weirs, its, catchment, area, covers, a, large, part, of, south, eastern, and, a, small, part, of, western, england, the, river, is, fed, by, at, least, 50, named, tributaries, the, river, contains, over, 80, islands, with, its, waters, varying, from, freshwater, to, almost, seawater, the, thames, supports, a, variety, of, wildlife, and, has, a, number, of, adjoining, sites, of, special, scientific, interest, with, the, largest, being, in, the, north, kent, marshes, and, covering, 5, 289, ha, 20, 4, sq, mi, according, to, mallory, and, adams, the, thames, from, middle, english, temese, is, derived, from, the, brittonic, name, for, the, river, tamesas, from, tam, ssa, recorded, in, latin, as, tamesis, and, yielding, modern, welsh, tafwys, thames, the, name, element, tam, may, have, meant, dark, and, can, be, compared, to, other, cognates, such, as, russian, proto, slavic, t, m, n, lithuanian, tamsi, dark, latvian, tumsa, darkness, sanskrit, tamas, and, welsh, tywyll, darkness, and, middle, irish, teimen, dark, grey, the, origin, is, shared, by, many, other, river, names, in, britain, such, as, the, river, tamar, at, the, border, of, devon, and, cornwall, several, rivers, named, tame, in, the, midlands, and, north, yorkshire, the, tavy, on, dartmoor, the, team, of, the, north, east, the, teifi, and, teme, of, wales, the, teviot, in, the, scottish, borders, and, a, thames, tributary, the, thame, kenneth, h, jackson, proposed, that, the, name, of, the, thames, is, not, indo, european, and, of, unknown, meaning, while, peter, kitson, suggested, that, it, is, indo, european, but, originated, before, the, britons, and, has, a, name, indicating, muddiness, from, a, root, t, melt, early, variants, of, the, name, include, indirect, evidence, for, the, antiquity, of, the, name, thames, is, provided, by, a, roman, potsherd, found, at, oxford, bearing, the, inscription, tamesubugus, fecit, tamesubugus, made, it, is, believed, that, tamesubugus, name, was, derived, from, that, of, the, river, tamese, was, referred, to, as, a, place, not, a, river, in, the, ravenna, cosmography, c, ad, 700, the, river, s, name, has, always, been, pronounced, with, a, simple, t, t, the, middle, english, spelling, was, typically, temese, and, the, brittonic, form, tamesis, a, similar, spelling, from, 1210, tamisiam, the, accusative, case, of, tamisia, see, kingston, upon, thames, early, history, is, found, in, magna, carta, the, thames, through, oxford, is, sometimes, called, the, isis, historically, and, especially, in, victorian, times, gazetteers, and, cartographers, insisted, that, the, entire, river, was, correctly, named, the, isis, from, its, source, down, to, dorchester, on, thames, and, that, only, from, this, point, where, the, river, meets, the, thame, and, becomes, the, thame, isis, supposedly, subsequently, abbreviated, to, thames, should, it, be, so, called, ordnance, survey, maps, still, label, the, thames, as, river, thames, or, isis, down, to, dorchester, since, the, early, 20th, century, this, distinction, has, been, lost, in, common, usage, outside, of, oxford, and, some, historians, suggest, the, name, isis, is, nothing, more, than, a, truncation, of, tamesis, the, latin, name, for, the, thames, sculptures, titled, tamesis, and, isis, by, anne, seymour, damer, are, located, on, the, bridge, at, henley, on, thames, oxfordshire, the, original, terracotta, and, plaster, models, were, exhibited, at, the, royal, academy, london, in, 1785, they, are, now, on, show, at, the, river, and, rowing, museum, in, henley, richard, coates, suggests, that, while, the, river, was, as, a, whole, called, the, thames, part, of, it, where, it, was, too, wide, to, ford, was, called, p, lowonida, this, gave, the, name, to, a, settlement, on, its, banks, which, became, known, as, londinium, from, the, indo, european, roots, pleu, flow, and, nedi, river, meaning, something, like, the, flowing, river, or, the, wide, flowing, unfordable, river, the, river, gives, its, name, to, three, informal, areas, the, thames, valley, a, region, of, england, around, the, river, between, oxford, and, west, london, the, thames, gateway, and, the, greatly, overlapping, thames, estuary, around, the, tidal, thames, to, the, east, of, london, and, including, the, waterway, itself, thames, valley, police, is, a, formal, body, that, takes, its, name, from, the, river, covering, three, counties, in, non, administrative, use, the, river, s, name, is, used, in, those, of, thames, valley, university, thames, water, thames, television, publishing, company, thames, hudson, thameslink, north, south, rail, service, passing, through, central, london, and, south, thames, college, an, example, of, its, use, in, the, names, of, historic, entities, is, the, thames, ironworks, and, shipbuilding, company, marks, of, human, activity, in, some, cases, dating, back, to, pre, roman, britain, are, visible, at, various, points, along, the, river, these, include, a, variety, of, structures, connected, with, use, of, the, river, such, as, navigations, bridges, and, watermills, as, well, as, prehistoric, burial, mounds, the, lower, thames, in, the, roman, era, was, a, shallow, waterway, winding, through, marshes, but, centuries, of, human, intervention, have, transformed, it, into, a, deep, tidal, canal, flowing, between, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, of, solid, walls, these, defend, a, floodplain, where, 1, 5, million, people, work, and, live, a, major, maritime, route, is, formed, for, much, of, its, length, for, shipping, and, supplies, through, the, port, of, london, for, international, trade, internally, along, its, length, and, by, its, connection, to, the, british, canal, system, the, river, s, position, has, put, it, at, the, centre, of, many, events, in, british, history, leading, to, it, being, described, by, john, burns, as, liquid, history, two, broad, canals, link, the, river, to, other, rivers, the, kennet, and, avon, canal, reading, to, bath, and, the, grand, union, canal, london, to, the, midlands, the, grand, union, effectively, bypassed, the, earlier, narrow, and, winding, oxford, canal, which, remains, open, as, a, popular, scenic, recreational, route, three, further, cross, basin, canals, are, disused, but, are, in, various, stages, of, reconstruction, the, thames, and, severn, canal, via, stroud, which, operated, until, 1927, to, the, west, coast, of, england, the, wey, and, arun, canal, to, littlehampton, which, operated, until, 1871, to, the, south, coast, and, the, wilts, berks, canal, rowing, and, sailing, clubs, are, common, along, the, thames, which, is, navigable, to, such, vessels, kayaking, and, canoeing, also, take, place, major, annual, events, include, the, henley, royal, regatta, and, the, boat, race, while, the, thames, has, been, used, during, two, summer, olympic, games, 1908, rowing, and, 1948, rowing, and, canoeing, safe, headwaters, and, reaches, are, a, summer, venue, for, organised, swimming, which, is, prohibited, on, safety, grounds, in, a, stretch, centred, on, central, london, after, the, river, took, its, present, day, course, many, of, the, banks, of, the, thames, estuary, and, the, thames, valley, in, london, were, partly, covered, in, marshland, as, was, the, adjoining, lower, lea, valley, streams, and, rivers, like, the, river, lea, tyburn, brook, and, bollo, brook, drained, into, the, river, while, some, islands, e, g, thorney, island, formed, over, the, ages, the, northern, tip, of, the, ancient, parish, of, lambeth, for, example, was, marshland, known, as, lambeth, marshe, but, it, was, drained, in, the, 18th, century, the, street, names, lower, marsh, and, upper, marsh, preserve, a, memory, until, the, middle, of, the, victorian, era, malaria, was, commonplace, beside, the, river, thames, even, in, london, and, was, frequently, lethal, some, cases, continued, to, occur, into, the, early, 20th, century, draining, of, the, marshes, helped, with, its, eradication, but, the, causes, are, complex, and, unclear, the, east, end, of, london, also, known, simply, as, the, east, end, was, the, area, of, london, east, of, the, medieval, walled, city, of, london, and, north, of, the, river, thames, although, it, is, not, defined, by, universally, accepted, formal, boundaries, the, river, lea, can, be, considered, another, boundary, most, of, the, local, riverside, was, also, marshland, the, land, was, drained, and, became, farmland, it, was, built, on, after, the, industrial, revolution, canvey, island, in, southern, essex, area, 18, 45, km, 2, 7, 12, sq, mi, population, 40, 000, was, once, marshy, but, is, now, a, fully, reclaimed, island, in, the, thames, estuary, separated, from, the, mainland, of, south, essex, by, a, network, of, creeks, lying, below, sea, level, it, is, prone, to, flooding, at, exceptional, tides, but, has, nevertheless, been, inhabited, since, roman, times, the, usually, quoted, source, of, the, thames, is, at, thames, head, at, grid, reference, st980994, this, is, about, 2, 4, km, 1, 5, mi, north, of, the, village, of, kemble, in, southern, gloucestershire, near, the, town, of, cirencester, in, the, cotswolds, however, seven, springs, near, cheltenham, where, the, churn, which, feeds, into, the, thames, near, cricklade, rises, is, also, sometimes, quoted, as, the, thames, source, as, this, location, is, farthest, from, the, mouth, and, adds, some, 23, km, 14, mi, to, the, river, s, length, at, seven, springs, above, the, source, is, a, stone, with, the, latin, hexameter, inscription, hic, tuus, o, tamesine, pater, septemgeminus, fons, which, means, here, o, father, thames, your, sevenfold, source, the, springs, at, seven, springs, flow, throughout, the, year, while, those, at, thames, head, are, seasonal, a, winterbourne, with, a, length, of, 346, km, 215, mi, the, thames, is, the, longest, river, entirely, in, england, the, longest, river, in, the, united, kingdom, the, severn, flows, partly, in, wales, however, as, the, river, churn, sourced, at, seven, springs, is, 23, km, 14, mi, longer, than, the, section, of, the, thames, from, its, traditional, source, at, thames, head, to, the, confluence, the, overall, length, of, the, thames, measured, from, seven, springs, at, 369, km, 229, mi, is, greater, than, the, severn, s, length, of, 350, km, 220, mi, thus, the, churn, thames, river, may, be, regarded, as, the, longest, natural, river, in, the, united, kingdom, the, stream, from, seven, springs, is, joined, at, coberley, by, a, longer, tributary, which, could, further, increase, the, length, of, the, thames, with, its, source, in, the, grounds, of, the, national, star, college, at, ullenwood, the, thames, flows, through, or, alongside, ashton, keynes, cricklade, lechlade, oxford, abingdon, on, thames, wallingford, goring, on, thames, and, streatley, at, the, goring, gap, pangbourne, and, whitchurch, on, thames, reading, wargrave, henley, on, thames, marlow, maidenhead,

survey, from, the, banks, of, the, tidal, river, thames, contain, geochemical, information, and, fossils, which, provide, a, 10, 000, year, record, of, sea, level, change, combined, this, and, other, studies, suggest, that, the, thames, sea, level, has, risen, more, than, 30, metres, 100, ft, during, the, holocene, at, a, rate, of, around, 5, to, 6, mm, 0, 20, to, 0, 24, in, per, year, from, 10, 000, to, 6, 000, years, ago, the, rise, of, sea, level, dramatically, reduced, when, the, ice, melt, nearly, concluded, over, the, past, 4, 000, years, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, rates, of, sea, level, rise, range, from, 1, 22, to, 2, 14, mm, 0, 048, to, 0, 084, in, per, year, the, thames, river, basin, district, including, the, medway, catchment, covers, an, area, of, 16, 130, km, 2, 6, 229, sq, mi, the, entire, river, basin, is, a, mixture, of, urban, and, rural, with, rural, landscape, predominating, in, the, western, part, the, area, is, among, the, driest, in, the, united, kingdom, water, resources, consist, of, groundwater, from, aquifers, and, water, taken, from, the, thames, and, its, tributaries, much, of, it, stored, in, large, bank, side, reservoirs, the, thames, itself, provides, two, thirds, of, london, s, drinking, water, while, groundwater, supplies, about, 40, of, public, water, supplies, in, the, overall, catchment, area, groundwater, is, an, important, water, source, especially, in, the, drier, months, so, maintaining, its, quality, and, quantity, is, extremely, important, groundwater, is, vulnerable, to, surface, pollution, especially, in, highly, urbanised, areas, brooks, canals, and, rivers, within, an, area, of, 9, 951, km, 2, 3, 842, sq, mi, combine, to, form, 38, main, tributaries, feeding, the, thames, between, its, source, and, teddington, lock, this, is, the, usual, tidal, limit, however, high, spring, tides, can, raise, the, head, water, level, in, the, reach, above, teddington, and, can, occasionally, reverse, the, river, flow, for, a, short, time, in, these, circumstances, tidal, effects, can, be, observed, upstream, to, the, next, lock, beside, molesey, weir, which, is, visible, from, the, towpath, and, bridge, beside, hampton, court, palace, before, teddington, lock, was, built, in, 1810, 12, the, river, was, tidal, at, peak, spring, tides, as, far, as, staines, upon, thames, in, descending, order,

responsible, for, managing, the, flow, of, water, to, help, prevent, and, mitigate, flooding, and, providing, for, navigation, the, volume, and, speed, of, water, downstream, is, managed, by, adjusting, the, sluices, at, each, of, the, weirs, and, at, peak, high, water, levels, are, generally, dissipated, over, preferred, flood, plains, adjacent, to, the, river, occasionally, flooding, of,

creek, roding, barking, creek, darent, and, ingrebourne, in, london, the, water, is, slightly, brackish, with, sea, salt, being, a, mix, of, sea, and, fresh, water, this, part, of, the, river, is, managed, by, the, port, of, london, authority, the, flood, threat, here, comes, from, high, tides, and, strong, winds, from, the, north, sea, and, the, thames, barrier, was, built, in, the, 1980s, to, protect, london, from, this, risk, the, nore, is, the, sandbank, that, marks, the, mouth, of, the, thames, estuary, where, the, outflow, from, the, thames, meets, the, north, sea, it, is, roughly, halfway, between, havengore, creek, in, essex, and, warden, point, on, the, isle, of, sheppey, in, kent, until, 1964, it, marked, the, seaward, limit, of, the, port, of, london, authority, as, the, sandbank, was, a, major, hazard, for, shipping, coming, in, and, out, of, london, in, 1732, it, received, the, world, s, first, lightship, this, became, a, major, landmark, and, was, used, as, an, assembly, point, for, shipping, today, it, is, marked, by, sea, reach, no, 1, buoy, the, river, thames, contains, over, 80, islands, ranging, from, the, large, estuarial, marshlands, of, the, isle, of, sheppey, and, canvey, island, to, small, tree, covered, islets, like, rose, isle, in, oxfordshire, and, headpile, eyot, in, berkshire, they, are, found, all, the, way, from, fiddler, s, island, in, oxfordshire, to, the, isle, of, sheppey, in, kent, some, of, the, largest, inland, islands, for, example, formosa, island, near, cookham, and, andersey, island, at, abingdon, were, created, naturally, when, the, course, of, the, river, divided, into, separate, streams, in, the, oxford, area, the, river, splits, into, several, streams, across, the, floodplain, seacourt, stream, castle,

platts, eyot, at, hampton, was, the, place, where, motor, torpedo, boats, mtb, s, were, built, tagg, s, island, near, molesey, was, associated, with, the, impresario, fred, karno, and, eel, pie, island, at, twickenham, was, the, birthplace, of, the, south, east, s, r, b, music, scene, westminster, abbey, and, the, palace, of, westminster, commonly, known, today, as, the, houses, of, parliament, were, built, on, thorney, island, which, used, to, be, an, eyot, researchers, have, identified, the, river, thames, as, a, discrete, drainage, line, flowing, as, early, as, 58, million, years, ago, in, the, thanetian, stage, of, the, late, palaeocene, epoch, until, around, 500, 000, years, ago, the, thames, flowed, on, its, existing, course, through, what, is, now, oxfordshire, before, turning, to, the, north, east, through, hertfordshire, and, east, anglia, and, reaching, the, north, sea, near, present, day, ipswich, at, this, time, the, river, system, headwaters, lay, in, the, english, west, midlands, and, may, at, times, have, received, drainage, from, the, berwyn, mountains, in, north, wales, about, 450, 000, years, ago, in, the, most, extreme, ice, age, of, the, pleistocene, the, anglian, the, furthest, southern, extent, of, the, ice, sheet, reached, hornchurch, in, east, london, the, vale, of, st, albans, and, the, finchley, gap, it, dammed, the, river, in, hertfordshire, resulting, in, the, formation, of, large, ice, lakes, which, eventually, burst, their, banks, and, caused, the, river, to, divert, onto, its, present, course, through, the, area, of, present, day, london, the, ice, lobe, which, stopped, at, present, day, finchley, deposited, about, 14, metres, 46, ft, of, boulder, clay, there, its, torrent, of, meltwater, gushed, through, the, finchley, gap, and, south, towards, the, new, course, of, the, thames, and, proceeded, to, carve, out, the, brent, valley, in, the, process, the, anglian, ice, advance, resulted, in, a, new, course, for, the, thames, through, berkshire, and, on, into, london, after, which, the, river, rejoined, its, original, course, in, southern, essex, near, the, present, river, blackwater, estuary, here, it, entered, a, substantial, freshwater, lake, in, the, southern, north, sea, basin, south, of, what, is, called, doggerland, the, overspill, of, this, lake, caused, the, formation, of, the, channel, river, and, later, the, dover, strait, gap, between, present, day, britain, and, france, subsequent, development, led, to, the, continuation, of, the, course, that, the, river, follows, at, the, present, day, most, of, the, bedrock, of, the, vale, of, aylesbury, comprises, clay, and, chalk, that, formed, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, and, at, one, time, was, under, the, proto, thames, at, this, time, the, vast, underground, reserves, of, water, formed, that, make, the, water, table, higher, than, average, in, the, vale, of, aylesbury, at, the, height, of, the, last, ice, age, around, 20, 000, bc, britain, was, connected, to, mainland, europe, by, a, large, expanse, of, land, known, as, doggerland, in, the, southern, north, sea, basin, at, this, time, the, thames, course, did, not, continue, to, doggerland, but, flowed, southwards, from, the, eastern, essex, coast, where, it, met, the, waters, of, the, proto, rhine, meuse, scheldt, delta, flowing, from, what, are, now, the, netherlands, and, belgium, these, rivers, formed, a, single, river, the, channel, river, fleuve, manche, that, passed, through, the, dover, strait, and, drained, into, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, western, english, channel, upon, the, valley, sides, of, the, thames, and, some, of, its, tributaries, can, be, seen, other, terraces, of, brickearth, laid, over, and, sometimes, interlayered, with, the, clays, these, deposits, were, brought, in, by, the, winds, during, the, periglacial, periods, suggesting, that, wide, flat, marshes, were, then, part, of, the, landscape, which, the, new, rivers, proceeded, to, cut, into, the, steepness, of, some, valley, sides, indicates, very, much, lower, mean, sea, levels, caused, by, the, glaciation, locking, up, so, much, water, upon, the, land, masses, thus, causing, the, river, water, to, flow, rapidly, seaward, and, so, erode, its, bed, quickly, downwards, the, original, land, surface, was, around, 110, to, 120, metres, 350, to, 400, ft, above, the, current, sea, level, the, surface, had, sandy, deposits, from, an, ancient, sea, laid, over, sedimentary, clay, this, is, the, blue, london, clay, all, the, erosion, down, from, this, higher, land, surface, and, the, sorting, action, by, these, changes, of, water, flow, and, direction, formed, what, is, known, as, the, thames, river, gravel, terraces, since, roman, times, and, perhaps, earlier, the, isostatic, rebound, from, the, weight, of, previous, ice, sheets, and, its, interplay, with, the, eustatic, change, in, sea, level, have, resulted, in, the, old, valley, of, the, river, brent, together, with, that, of, the, thames, silting, up, again, thus, along, much, of, the, brent, s, present, day, course, one, can, make, out, the, water, meadows, of, rich, alluvium, which, is, augmented, by, frequent, floods, various, species, of, birds, feed, off, the, river, or, nest, on, it, some, being, found, both, at, sea, and, inland, these, include, cormorant, black, headed, gull, and, herring, gull, the, mute, swan, is, a, familiar, sight, on, the, river, but, the, escaped, black, swan, is, more, rare, the, annual, ceremony, of, swan, upping, is, an, old, tradition, of, counting, stocks, non, native, geese, that, can, be, seen, include, canada, geese, egyptian, geese, and, bar, headed, geese, and, ducks, include, the, familiar, native, mallard, plus, introduced, mandarin, duck, and, wood, duck, other, water, birds, to, be, found, on, the, thames, include, the, great, crested, grebe, coot, moorhen, heron, and, kingfisher, many, types, of, british, birds, also, live, alongside, the, river, although, they, are, not, specific, to, the, river, habitat, the, thames, contains, both, sea, water, and, fresh, water, thus, providing, support, for, seawater, and, freshwater, fish, however, many, populations, of, fish, are, at, risk, and, are, being, killed, in, tens, of, thousands, because, of, pollutants, leaking, into, the, river, from, human, activities, salmon, which, inhabit, both, environments, have, been, reintroduced, and, a, succession, of, fish, ladders, have, been, built, into, weirs, to, enable, them, to, travel, upstream, on, 5, august, 1993, the, largest, non, tidal, salmon, in, recorded, history, was, caught, close, to, boulters, lock, in, maidenhead, the, specimen, weighed, 6, 6, kg, 14, 1, 2, lb, and, measured, 56, cm, 22, in, in, length, the, eel, is, particularly, associated, with, the, thames, and, there, were, formerly, many, eel, traps, freshwater, fish, of, the, thames, and, its, tributaries, include, brown, trout, chub, dace, roach, barbel, perch, pike, bleak, and, flounder, colonies, of, short, snouted, seahorses, as, well, as, tope, and, starry, smooth, hound, sharks, have, also, recently, been, discovered, in, the, river, the, thames, is, also, host, to, some, invasive, crustaceans, including, the, signal, crayfish, and, the, chinese, mitten, crab, aquatic, mammals, are, also, known, to, inhabit, the, thames, the, population, of, grey, and, harbour, seals, numbers, up, to, 700, in, the, thames, estuary, these, animals, have, been, sighted, as, far, upriver, as, richmond, bottlenose, dolphins, and, harbour, porpoises, are, also, sighted, in, the, thames, on, 20, january, 2006, a, 4, 9, 5, 5, m, 16, 18, ft, northern, bottle, nosed, whale, was, seen, in, the, thames, as, far, upstream, as, chelsea, this, was, extremely, unusual, this, whale, is, generally, found, in, deep, sea, waters, crowds, gathered, along, the, riverbanks, to, witness, the, spectacle, but, there, was, soon, concern, as, the, animal, came, within, yards, of, the, banks, almost, beaching, and, crashed, into, an, empty, boat, causing, slight, bleeding, about, 12, hours, later, the, whale, is, believed, to, have, been, seen, again, near, greenwich, possibly, heading, back, to, sea, a, rescue, attempt, lasted, several, hours, but, the, whale, died, on, a, barge, see, river, thames, whale, the, river, thames, has, played, several, roles, in, human, history, as, an, economic, resource, a, maritime, route, a, boundary, a, fresh, water, source, a, source, of, food, and, more, recently, a, leisure, facility, in, 1929, john, burns, one, time, mp, for, battersea, responded, to, an, american, s, unfavourable, comparison, of, the, thames, with, the, mississippi, by, coining, the, expression, the, thames, is, liquid, history, there, is, evidence, of, human, habitation, living, off, the, river, along, its, length, dating, back, to, neolithic, times, the, british, museum, has, a, decorated, bowl, 3300, 2700, bc, found, in, the, river, at, hedsor, buckinghamshire, and, a, considerable, amount, of, material, was, discovered, during, the, excavations, of, dorney, lake, a, number, of, bronze, age, sites, and, artefacts, have, been, discovered, along, the, banks, of, the, river, including, settlements, at, lechlade, cookham, and, sunbury, on, thames, so, extensive, have, the, changes, to, this, landscape, been, that, what, little, evidence, there, is, of, man, s, presence, before, the, ice, came, has, inevitably, shown, signs, of, transportation, here, by, water, and, reveals, nothing, specifically, local, likewise, later, evidence, of, occupation, even, since, the, arrival, of, the, romans, may, lie, next, to, the, original, banks, of, the, brent, but, have, been, buried, under, centuries, of, silt, some, of, the, earliest, written, references, to, the, thames, latin, tamesis, occur, in, julius, caesar, s, account, of, his, second, expedition, to, britain, in, 54, bc, when, the, thames, presented, a, major, obstacle, and, he, encountered, the, iron, age, belgic, tribes, catuvellauni, and, atrebates, along, the, river, at, the, confluence, of, the, thames, and, cherwell, was, the, site, of, early, settlements, and, the, river, cherwell, marked, the, boundary, between, the, dobunni, tribe, to, the, west, and, the, catuvellauni, to, the, east, these, were, pre, roman, celtic, tribes, in, the, late, 1980s, a, large, romano, british, settlement, was, excavated, on, the, edge, of, the, village, of, ashton, keynes, in, wiltshire, starting, in, ad, 43, under, the, emperor, claudius, the, romans, occupied, england, and, recognising, the, river, s, strategic, and, economic, importance, built, fortifications, along, the, thames, valley, including, a, major, camp, at, dorchester, cornhill, and, ludgate, hill, provided, a, defensible, site, near, a, point, on, the, river, both, deep, enough, for, the, era, s, ships, and, narrow, enough, to, be, bridged, londinium, london, grew, up, around, the, walbrook, on, the, north, bank, around, the, year, 47, boudica, s, iceni, razed, the, settlement, in, ad, 60, or, 61, but, it, was, soon, rebuilt, and, once, the, bridge, was, built, it, grew, to, become, the, provincial, capital, of, the, island, the, next, roman, bridges, upstream, were, at, staines, on, the, devil, s, highway, between, londinium, and, calleva, silchester, boats, could, be, swept, up, to, it, on, the, rising, tide, with, no, need, for, wind, or, muscle, power, a, romano, british, settlement, grew, up, north, of, the, confluence, partly, because, the, site, was, naturally, protected, from, attack, on, the, east, side, by, the, river, cherwell, and, on, the, west, by, the, river, thames, this, settlement, dominated, the, pottery, trade, in, what, is, now, central, southern, england, and, pottery, was, distributed, by, boats, on, the, thames, and, its, tributaries, competition, for, the, use, of, the, river, created, the, centuries, old, conflict, between, those, who, wanted, to, dam, the, river, to, build, millraces, and, fish, traps, and, those, who, wanted, to, travel, and, carry, goods, on, it, economic, prosperity, and, the, foundation, of, wealthy, monasteries, by, the, anglo, saxons, attracted, unwelcome, visitors, and, by, around, ad, 870, the, vikings, were, sweeping, up, the, thames, on, the, tide, and, creating, havoc, as, in, their, destruction, of, chertsey, abbey, once, king, william, had, won, total, control, of, the, strategically, important, thames, valley, he, went, on, to, invade, the, rest, of, england, he, had, many, castles, built, including, those, at, wallingford, rochester, windsor, and, most, importantly, the, tower, of, london, many, details, of, thames, activity, are, recorded, in, the, domesday, book, the, following, centuries, saw, the, conflict, between, king, and, barons, coming, to, a, head, in, ad, 1215, when, king, john, was, forced, to, sign, magna, carta, on, an, island, in, the, thames, at, runnymede, among, a, host, of, other, things, this, granted, the, barons, the, right, of, navigation, under, clause, 23, another, major, consequence, of, john, s, reign, was, the, completion, of, the, multi, piered, london, bridge, which, acted, as, a, barricade, and, barrage, on, the, river, affecting, the, tidal, flow, upstream, and, increasing, the, likelihood, of, the, river, freezing, over, in, tudor, and, stuart, times, various, kings, and, queens, built, magnificent, riverside, palaces, at, hampton, court, kew, richmond, on, thames, whitehall, and, greenwich, as, early, as, the, 1300s, the, thames, was, used, to, dispose, of, waste, matter, produced, in, the, city, of, london, thus, turning, the, river, into, an, open, sewer, in, 1357, edward, iii, described, the, state, of, the, river, in, a, proclamation, dung, and, other, filth, had, accumulated, in, divers, places, upon, the, banks, of, the, river, with, fumes, and, other, abominable, stenches, arising, therefrom, the, growth, of, the, population, of, london, greatly, increased, the, amount, of, waste, that, entered, the, river, including, human, excrement, animal, waste, from, slaughter, houses, and, waste, from, manufacturing, processes, according, to, historian, peter, ackroyd, a, public, lavatory, on, london, bridge, showered, its, contents, directly, onto, the, river, below, and, latrines, were, built, over, all, the, tributaries, that, issued, into, the, thames, the, stuart, monarchs, and, the, city, of, london, organised, pageants, on, the, river, including, london, s, love, to, prince, henry, in, may, 1610, and, a, theatrical, sea, battle, for, the, wedding, of, princess, elizabeth, and, frederick, v, of, the, palatinate, in, february, 1613, during, a, series, of, cold, winters, the, thames, froze, over, above, london, bridge, in, the, first, frost, fair, in, 1607, a, tent, city, was, set, up, on, the, river, along, with, a, number, of, amusements, including, ice, bowling, in, good, conditions, barges, travelled, daily, from, oxford, to, london, carrying, timber, wool, foodstuffs, and, livestock, the, stone, from, the, cotswolds, used, to, rebuild, st, paul, s, cathedral, after, the, great, fire, in, 1666, was, brought, all, the, way, down, from, radcot, the, thames, provided, the, major, route, between, the, city, of, london, and, westminster, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, clannish, guild, of, watermen, ferried, londoners, from, landing, to, landing, and, tolerated, no, outside, interference, in, 1715, thomas, doggett, was, so, grateful, to, a, local, waterman, for, his, efforts, in, ferrying, him, home, pulling, against, the, tide, that, he, set, up, a, rowing, race, for, professional, watermen, known, as, doggett, s, coat, and, badge, by, the, 18th, century, the, thames, was, one, of, the, world, s, busiest, waterways, as, london, became, the, centre, of, the, vast, mercantile, british, empire, and, progressively, over, the, next, century, the, docks, expanded, in, the, isle, of, dogs, and, beyond, efforts, were, made, to, resolve, the, navigation, conflicts, upstream, by, building, locks, along, the, thames, after, temperatures, began, to, rise, again, starting, in, 1814, the, river, stopped, freezing, over, the, building, of, a, new, london, bridge, in, 1825, with, fewer, piers, pillars, than, the, old, allowed, the, river, to, flow, more, freely, and, prevented, it, from, freezing, over, in, cold, winters, throughout, early, modern, history, the, population, of, london, and, its, industries, discarded, their, rubbish, in, the, river, this, included, the, waste, from, slaughterhouses, fish, markets, and, tanneries, the, buildup, in, household, cesspools, could, sometimes, overflow, especially, when, it, rained, and, was, washed, into, london, s, streets, and, sewers, which, eventually, led, to, the, thames, in, the, late, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, people, known, as, mudlarks, scavenged, in, the, river, mud, for, a, meagre, living, in, the, 19th, century, the, quality, of, water, in, the, thames, deteriorated, further, the, discharge, of, raw, sewage, into, the, thames, was, formerly, only, common, in, the, city, of, london, making, its, tideway, a, harbour, for, many, harmful, bacteria, gasworks, were, built, alongside, the, river, and, their, by, products, leaked, into, the, water, including, spent, lime, ammonia, cyanide, and, carbolic, acid, the, river, had, an, unnaturally, warm, temperature, caused, by, chemical, reactions, in, the, water, which, also, removed, the, water, s, oxygen, four, serious, cholera, outbreaks, killed, tens, of, thousands, of, people, between, 1832, and, 1865, historians, have, attributed, prince, albert, s, death, in, 1861, to, typhoid, that, had, spread, in, the, river, s, dirty, waters, beside, windsor, castle, wells, with, water, tables, that, mixed, with, tributaries, or, the, non, tidal, thames, faced, such, pollution, with, the, widespread, installation, of, the, flush, toilet, in, the, 1850s, in, the, great, stink, of, 1858, pollution, in, the, river, reached, such, an, extreme, that, sittings, of, the, house, of, commons, at, westminster, had, to, be, abandoned, chlorine, soaked, drapes, were, hung, in, the, windows, of, parliament, in, an, attempt, to, stave, off, the, smell, of, the, river, but, to, no, avail, there, followed, a, concerted, effort, to, contain, the, city, s, sewage, by, constructing, massive, sewer, systems, on, the, north, and, south, river, embankments, under, the, supervision, of, engineer, joseph, bazalgette, meanwhile, there, were, similar, huge, projects, to, ensure, the, water, supply, reservoirs, and, pumping, stations, were, built, on, the, river, to, the, west, of, london, slowly, helping, the, quality, of, water, to, improve, the, victorian, era, was, one, of, imaginative, engineering, the, coming, of, the, railways, added, railway, bridges, to, the, earlier, road, bridges, and, also, reduced, commercial, activity, on, the, river, however, sporting, and, leisure, use, increased, with, the, establishment, of, regattas, such, as, henley, and, the, boat, race, one, of, the, worst, river, disasters, in, england, was, on, 3, september, 1878, when, the, crowded, pleasure, boat, princess, alice, collided, with, the, bywell, castle, killing, over, 640, people, the, growth, of, road, transport, and, the, decline, of, the, empire, in, the, years, following, 1914, reduced, the, economic, prominence, of, the, river, during, the, second, world, war, the, protection, of, certain, thames, side, facilities, particularly, docks, and, water, treatment, plants, was, crucial, to, the, munitions, and, water, supply, of, the, country, the, river, s, defences, included, the, maunsell, forts, in, the, estuary, and, the, use, of, barrage, balloons, to, counter, german, bombers, using, the, reflectivity, and, shapes, of, the, river, to, navigate, during, the, blitz, in, the, post, war, era, although, the, port, of, london, remains, one, of, the, uk, s, three, main, ports, most, trade, has, moved, downstream, from, central, london, in, the, late, 1950s, the, discharge, of, methane, gas, in, the, depths, of, the, river, caused, the, water, to, bubble, and, the, toxins, wore, away, at, boats, propellers, the, decline, of, heavy, industry, and, tanneries, reduced, use, of, oil, pollutants, and, improved, sewage, treatment, have, led, to, much, better, water, quality, compared, to, the, late, 19th, and, early, to, mid, 20th, centuries, and, aquatic, life, has, returned, to, its, formerly, dead, stretches, alongside, the, entire, river, runs, the, thames, path, a, national, route, for, walkers, and, cyclists, in, the, early, 1980s, a, pioneering, flood, control, device, the, thames, barrier, was, opened, it, is, closed, to, tides, several, times, a, year, to, prevent, water, damage, to, london, s, low, lying, areas, upstream, the, 1928, thames, flood, demonstrated, the, severity, of, this, type, of, event, in, the, late, 1990s, the, 11, km, 7, mi, long, jubilee, river, was, built, as, a, wide, naturalistic, flood, relief, channel, from, taplow, to, eton, to, help, reduce, the, flood, risk, in, maidenhead, windsor, and, eton, although, it, appears, to, have, increased, flooding, in, the, villages, immediately, downstream, in, 2010, the, thames, won, the, largest, environmental, award, in, the, world, the, 350, 000, international, riverprize, in, august, 2022, the, first, few, miles, of, the, river, dried, up, due, to, the, previous, month, s, heatwave, and, the, source, of, the, river, temporarily, moved, five, miles, to, beyond, somerford, keynes, one, of, the, major, resources,

thames, however, navigation, was, increasingly, impeded, by, weirs, and, mills, and, in, the, 14th, century, the, river, probably, ceased, to, be, navigable, for, heavy, traffic, between, henley, and, oxford, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, river, seems, to, have, been, reopened, for, navigation, from, henley, to, burcot, the, first, commission, concerned, with, the, management, of, the, river, was, the, oxford, burcot, commission, formed, in, 1605, to, make, the, river, navigable, between, burcot, and, oxford, in, 1751, the, thames, navigation, commission, was, formed, to, manage, the, whole, non, tidal, river, above, staines, the, city, of, london, long, claimed, responsibility, for, the, tidal, river, a, long, running, dispute, between, the, city, and, the, crown, over, ownership, of, the, river, was, not, settled, until, 1857, when, the, thames, conservancy, was, formed, to, manage, the, river, from, staines, downstream, in, 1866, the, functions, of, the, thames, navigation, commission, were, transferred, to, the, thames, conservancy, which, thus, had, responsibility, for, the, whole, river, in, 1909, the, powers, of, the, thames, conservancy, over, the, tidal, river, below, teddington, were, transferred, to, the, port, of, london, authority, in, 1974, the, thames, conservancy, became, part, of, the, new, thames, water, authority, when, thames, water, was,

in, use, kingston, s, growth, is, believed, to, stem, from, its, having, the, only, crossing, between, london, bridge, and, staines, until, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, during, the, 18th, century, many, stone, and, brick, road, bridges, were, built, from, new, or, to, replace, existing, bridges, both, in, london, and, along, the, length, of, the, river, these, included, putney, bridge, westminster, bridge, datchet, bridge, windsor, bridge, and, sonning, bridge, several, central, london, road, bridges, were, built, in, the, 19th, century, most, conspicuously, tower, bridge, the, only, bascule, bridge, on, the, river, designed, to, allow, ocean, going, ships, to, pass, beneath, it, the, most, recent, road, bridges, are, the, bypasses, at, isis, bridge, and, marlow, by, pass, bridge, and, the, motorway, bridges, most, notably, the, two, on, the, m25, route, queen, elizabeth, ii, bridge, and, m25, runnymede, bridge, railway, development, in, the, 19th, century, resulted, in, a, spate, of, bridge, building, including, blackfriars, railway, bridge, and, charing, cross, hungerford, railway, bridge, in, central, london, and, the, railway, bridges, by, isambard, kingdom,

built, in, east, london, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, being, the, blackwall, tunnel, and, the, rotherhithe, tunnel, the, latest, tunnels, are, the, dartford, crossings, many, foot, crossings, were, established, across, the, weirs, that, were, built, on, the, non, tidal, river, and, some, of, these, remained, when, the, locks, were, built, for, example, at, benson, lock, others, were, replaced, by, a, footbridge, when, the, weir, was, removed, as, at, hart, s, weir, footbridge, around, 2000, several, footbridges, were, added, along, the, thames, either, as, part, of, the, thames, path, or, in, commemoration, of, the, millennium, these, include, temple, footbridge, bloomers, hole, footbridge, the, hungerford, footbridges, and, the, millennium, bridge, all, of, which, have, distinctive, design, characteristics, before, bridges, were, built, the, main, means, of, crossing, the, river, was, by, ferry, a, significant, number, of, ferries, were, provided, specifically, for, navigation, purposes, when, the, towpath, changed, sides, it, was, necessary, to, take, the, towing, horse, and, its, driver, across, the, river, this, was, no, longer, necessary, when, barges, were, powered, by, steam, some, ferries, still, operate, on, the, river, the, woolwich, ferry, carries, cars, and, passengers, across, the, river, in, the, thames, gateway, and, links, the, north, circular, and, south, circular, roads, upstream, are, smaller, pedestrian, ferries, for, example, hampton, ferry, and, shepperton, to, weybridge, ferry, the, last, being, the, only, non, permanent, crossing, that, remains, on, the, thames, path, whilst, the, use, of, the, river, to, drive, water, mills, has, largely, died, out, there, has, been, a, recent, trend, to, use, the, head, of, water, provided, by, the, river, s, existing, weirs, to, drive, small, hydro, electric, power, plants, using, archimedes, screw, turbines, operational, schemes, include, treated, waste, water, from, all, the, towns,
