itself, discoveries, of, ruins, under, the, persian, gulf, may, be, of, dilmun, there, is, both, literary, and, archaeological, evidence, of, extensive, trade, between, ancient, mesopotamia, and, the, indus, valley, civilization, which, most, scholars, identify, with, meluhha, impressions, of, clay, seals, from, the, indus, valley, city, of, harappa, were, evidently, used, to, seal, bundles, of,

the, other, evidence, of, dilmun, being, an, influential, trading, center, what, the, commerce, consisted, of, is, less, known, timber, and, precious, woods, ivory, lapis, lazuli, gold, luxury, goods, such, as, carnelian, and, glazed, stone, beads, pearls, from, the, persian, gulf, and, shell, and, bone, inlays, were, among, the, goods, sent, to, mesopotamia, in, exchange, for, silver, tin, woolen, textiles, olive, oil, and, grains, copper, ingots, from, oman, and, bitumen, which, occurred, naturally, in, mesopotamia, may, have, been, exchanged, for, cotton, textiles, and, domestic, fowl, major, products, of, the, indus, region, that, are, not, native, to, mesopotamia, instances, of, all, of, these, trade, goods, have, been, found, the, importance, of, this, trade, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, the, weights, and, measures, used, at, dilmun, were, in, fact, identical, to, those, used, by, the, indus, and, were, not, used, in, southern, mesopotamia, mesopotamian, trade, documents, lists, of, goods, and, official, inscriptions, mentioning, meluhha, supplement, harappan, seals, and, archaeological, finds, literary, references, to, trade, with, meluhha, date, from, the, akkadian, period, c, 2300, bc, but, the, trade, probably, started, in, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 2600, bc, some, meluhhan, vessels, may, have, sailed, directly, to, mesopotamian, ports, but, by, the, isin, larsa, period, c, 1900, bc, dilmun, monopolized, the, trade, the, bahrain, national, museum, assesses, that, its, golden, age, lasted, from, c, 2200, bc, to, 1600, bc, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, gilgamesh, had, to, pass, through, mount, mashu, to, reach, dilmun, mount, mashu, is, usually, identified, with, the, whole, of, the, parallel, lebanon, and, anti, lebanon, ranges, with, the, narrow, gap, between, these, mountains, constituting, the, tunnel, dilmun, sometimes, described, as, the, place, where, the, sun, rises, and, the, land, of, the, living, is, the, scene, of, some, versions, of, the, eridu, genesis, and, the, place, where, the, deified, sumerian, hero, of, the, flood, utnapishtim, ziusudra, was, taken, by, the, gods, to, live, forever, thorkild, jacobsen, s, translation, of, the, eridu, genesis, calls, it, mount, dilmun, and, a, faraway, half, mythical, place, dilmun, is, also, described, in, the, epic, story, of, enki, and, ninhursag, as, the, site, at, which, the, creation, occurred, enki, says, to, ninhursag, for, dilmun, the, land, of, my, lady, s, heart, i, will, create, long, waterways, rivers, and, canals, whereby, water, will, flow, to, quench, the, thirst, of, all, beings, and, bring, abundance, to, all, that, lives, ninlil, the, sumerian, goddess, of, air, and, southerly, winds, had, her, home, in, dilmun, however, in, the, early, epic, enmerkar, and, the, lord, of, aratta, the, main, events, which, center, on, enmerkar, s, construction, of, the, ziggurats, in, uruk, and, eridu, are, described, as, taking, place, in, a, world, before, dilmun, had, yet, been, settled, gerrha, was, an, ancient, city, of, eastern, arabia, on, the, west, side, of, the, persian, gulf, more, accurately, the, ancient, city, of, gerrha, has, been, determined, to, have, existed, near, or, under, the, present, fort, of, uqair, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, northeast, of, al, a, s, in, the, eastern, province, of, saudi, arabia, this, site, was, first, proposed, by, r, e, cheesman, in, 1924, gerrha, and, uqair, are, archaeological, sites, on, the, eastern, coast, of, the, arabian, peninsula, only, 100, kilometres, 60, miles, from, the, ancient, burial, grounds, of, dilmun, on, the, island, of, bahrain, prior, to, gerrha, the, area, belonged, to, the, dilmuni, civilization, gerrha, itself, was, the, center, of, an, arab, kingdom, from, approximately, 650, bc, to, circa, 300, ad, the, kingdom, was, attacked, by, antiochus, iii, the, great, in, 205, 204, bc, though, it, seems, to, have, survived, it, is, unknown, exactly, when, gerrha, fell, but, the, area, was, under, sassanid, persian, control, after, 300, ad, gerrha, was, described, by, strabo, as, inhabited, by, chaldean, exiles, from, babylon, who, built, their, houses, of, salt, and, repaired, them, by, the, application, of, salt, water, pliny, the, elder, natural, history, 6, 32, says, it, was, 8, kilometres, 5, mi, in, circumference, with, towers, built, of, square, blocks, of, salt, gerrha, was, destroyed, by, the, qarmatians, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, and, all, 300, 000, inhabitants, were, killed, it, was, 3, kilometres, 2, mi, from, the, persian, gulf, near, current, day, hofuf, the, researcher, abdulkhaliq, al, janbi, argued, in, his, book, that, gerrha, was, most, likely, the, ancient, city, of, hajar, located, in, modern, day, al, ahsa, saudi, arabia, al, janbi, s, theory, is, the, most, widely, accepted, one, by, modern, scholars, although, there, are, some, difficulties, with, this, argument, given, that, al, ahsa, is, 60, km, 37, mi, inland, and, thus, less, likely, to, be, the, starting, point, for, a, trader, s, route, making, the, location, within, the, archipelago, of, islands, comprising, the, modern, kingdom, of, bahrain, particularly, the, main, island, of, bahrain, itself, another, possibility, various, other, identifications, of, the, site, have, been, attempted, with, jean, baptiste, bourguignon, d, anville, choosing, qatif, and, carsten, niebuhr, preferring, kuwait, the, island, of, bahrain, was, referred, to, by, the, ancient, greeks, as, tylos, ancient, greek, and, was, known, for, its, pearls, from, the, 6th, to, 3rd, century, bc, bahrain, was, part, of, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, 119, the, greek, admiral, nearchus, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, of, alexander, s, commanders, to, visit, the, island, and, he, found, a, verdant, land, that, was, part, of, a, wide, trading, network, he, recorded, in, the, island, of, tylos, situated, in, the, persian, gulf, are, large, plantations, of, cotton, trees, from, which, are, manufactured, clothes, called, sindones, of, different, degrees, of, value, some, being, costly, others, less, expensive, the, use, of, these, is, mostly, confined, to, india, but, extends, also, to, arabia, the, greek, historian, theophrastus, states, that, much, of, the, archipelago, was, covered, in, these, cotton, trees, and, noted, that, textiles, were, a, major, industry, according, to, him, tylos, was, also, famous, for, exporting, engraved, walking, canes, popular, in, babylon, it, is, not, known, whether, bahrain, was, part, of, the, seleucid, empire, although, the, archaeological, site, at, qalat, al, bahrain, has, been, proposed, as, a, seleucid, base, in, the, persian, gulf, alexander, had, planned, to, settle, the, eastern, shores, of, the, persian, gulf, with, greek, colonists, and, although, it, is, not, clear, that, this, happened, on, the, scale, he, envisaged, tylos, was, very, much, part, of, the, hellenised, world, the, language, of, the, upper, classes, was, greek, although, aramaic, was, in, everyday, use, while, zeus, was, worshipped, in, the, form, of, the, arabian, sun, god, shams, tylos, even, became, the, site, of, greek, athletic, contests, the, name, tylos, is, thought, to, be, a, hellenisation, of, the, semitic, tilmun, from, dilmun, the, term, tylos, was, commonly, used, for, the, archipelago, ptolemy, s, geographia, when, the, inhabitants, are, referred, to, as, thilouanoi, inhabitants, of, tylos, some, place, names, in, bahrain, go, back, to, the, tylos, era, for, instance, the, residential, suburb, of, arad, located, in, muharraq, is, believed, to, originate, from, arados, the, ancient, greek, name, for, the, island, of, muharraq, the, greek, historians, herodotus, and, strabo, both, believed, the, phoenicians, originated, from, bahrain, this, theory, was, accepted, by, the, 19th, century, german, classicist, arnold, heeren, who, said, that, in, the, greek, geographers, for, instance, we, read, of, two, islands, named, tyrus, or, tylos, and, arad, bahrain, which, boasted, that, they, were, the, mother, country, of, the, phoenicians, and, exhibited, relics, of, phoenician, temples, the, people, of, tyre, in, particular, have, long, maintained, persian, gulf, origins, and, the, similarity, in, the, words, tylos, and, tyre, has, been, commented, upon, herodotus, s, account, written, c, 430, bc, refers, to, phoenicians, inhabiting, the, shores, of, the, persian, gulf, according, to, the, persians, who, are, best, informed, in, history, the, phoenicians, began, the, quarrel, these, people, who, had, formerly, dwelt, in, the, far, east, and, then, to, the, shores, of, the, erythraean, sea, having, migrated, to, the, mediterranean, and, settled, in, the, parts, which, they, now, inhabit, began, at, once, they, say, to, adventure, on, long, voyages, freighting, their, vessels, with, the, wares, of, egypt, and, assyria, with, the, waning, of, seleucid, greek, power, tylos, was, incorporated, into, characene, the, state, founded, by, hyspaosines, in, 127, bc, in, modern, day, kuwait, a, building, inscription, found, in, bahrain, indicates, that, hyspoasines, occupied, the, islands, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, arrival, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, ad, eastern, arabia, was, controlled, by, two, other, iranian, dynasties, the, parthians, and, the, sasanians, by, about, 250, bc, the, seleucids, lost, their, territories, to, the, parthians, an, iranian, tribe, from, central, asia, the, parthian, empire, brought, the, persian, gulf, under, their, control, and, extended, their, influence, as, far, as, oman, because, they, needed, to, control, the, persian, gulf, trade, route, the, parthians, established, garrisons, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, persian, gulf, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, sasanians, succeeded, the, parthians, and, held, the, area, until, the, rise, of, islam, four, centuries, later, ardashir, the, first, ruler, of, the, sasanian, dynasty, conquered, bahrain, and, northern, oman, and, appointed, his, son, shapur, i, as, the, governor, of, eastern, arabia, the, province, of, mazun, shapur, constructed, a, new, city, there, and, named, it, batan, ardashir, after, his, father, mazun, stretched, from, oman, in, the, south, to, the, shatt, al, arab, in, the, north, and, included, the, archipelago, of, bahrain, thus, it, is, roughly, coterminous, with, the, modern, definition, of, eastern, arabia, it, was, subdivided, into, the, three, districts, of, haggar, hofuf, saudi, arabia, batan, ardashir, al, qatif, saudi, arabia, and, mishmahig, muharraq, bahrain, which, included, the, bahrain, archipelago, the, christian, name, used, for, the, region, encompassing, north, eastern, arabia, was, beth, qatraye, which, translates, to, region, of, the, qataris, in, syriac, it, included, bahrain, tarout, al, khatt, al, a, s, and, qatar, by, the, 5th, century, beth, qatraye, was, a, major, center, for, nestorian, christianity, which, had, come, to, dominate, the, southern, shores, of, the, persian, gulf, within, the, byzantine, empire, nestorians, were, persecuted, as, heretics, but, as, eastern, arabia, was, far, enough, from, the, empire, s, borders, that, nestorianism, flourished, several, notable, nestorian, writers, originated, from, beth, qatraye, including, isaac, of, nineveh, dadisho, qatraya, gabriel, of, qatar, and, ahob, of, qatar, christianity, declined, with, the, arrival, of, islam, in, eastern, arabia, in, 628, by, 676, the, bishops, of, beth, qatraye, had, stopped, attending, synods, although, christianity, persisted, in, the, region, until, the, late, 9th, century, the, dioceses, of, beth, qatraye, did, not, form, an, ecclesiastical, province, except, for, a, short, period, during, the, mid, to, late, 7th, century, they, were, instead, subject, to, the, metropolitanate, of, fars, hafit, tuwwam, abounds,
