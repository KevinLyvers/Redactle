wallonia, w, l, o, n, i, french, wallonie, officially, the, walloon, region, french, r, gion, wallonne, is, one, of, the, three, regions, of, belgium, along, with, flanders, and, brussels, covering, the, southern, portion, of, the, country, wallonia, is, primarily, french, speaking, it, accounts, for, 55, of, belgium, s, territory, but, only, a, third, of, its, population, the, walloon, region, and, the, french, community, of, belgium, which, is, the, political, entity, responsible, for, matters, related, mainly, to, culture, and, education, are, independent, concepts, because, the, french, community, of, belgium, encompasses, both, wallonia, and, the, bilingual, brussels, capital, region, but, not, the, german, speaking, community, of, belgium, during, the, industrial, revolution, wallonia, was, second, only, to, the, united, kingdom, in, industrialization, capitalizing, on, its, extensive, deposits, of, coal, and, iron, this, brought, the, region, wealth, and, from, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, to, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, wallonia, was, the, more, prosperous, half, of, belgium, since, world, war, ii, the, importance, of, heavy, industry, has, greatly, diminished, and, the, flemish, region, has, exceeded, wallonia, in, wealth, as, wallonia, has, declined, economically, wallonia, now, suffers, from, high, unemployment, and, has, a, significantly, lower, gdp, per, capita, than, flanders, the, economic, inequalities, and, linguistic, divide, between, the, two, are, major, sources, of, political, conflicts, in, belgium, and, a, major, factor, in, flemish, separatism, the, capital, of, wallonia, is, namur, and, the, most, populous, city, is, charleroi, most, of, wallonia, s, major, cities, and, two, thirds, of, its, population, lie, along, the, east, west, aligned, sambre, and, meuse, valley, the, former, industrial, backbone, of, belgium, to, the, north, of, this, valley, wallonia, lies, on, the, central, belgian, plateau, which, like, flanders, is, a, relatively, flat, and, agriculturally, fertile, area, the, south, and, southeast, of, wallonia, is, made, up, of, the, ardennes, an, expanse, of, forested, highland, that, is, less, densely, populated, there, is, a, german, speaking, minority, in, eastern, wallonia, resulting, from, the, annexation, of, three, cantons, previously, part, of, the, german, empire, at, the, conclusion, of, world, war, i, this, community, represents, less, than, 1, of, the, belgian, population, it, forms, the, german, speaking, community, of, belgium, which, has, its, own, government, and, parliament, for, culture, related, issues, wallonia, borders, flanders, and, the, netherlands, the, province, of, limburg, in, the, north, france, grand, est, and, hauts, de, france, to, the,

a, member, of, the, organisation, internationale, de, la, francophonie, since, 1980, the, term, wallonia, can, mean, slightly, different, things, in, different, contexts, one, of, the, three, federal, regions, of, belgium, is, still, constitutionally, defined, as, the, walloon, region, as, opposed, to, wallonia, but, the, latter, has, been, adopted, by, the, regional, government, and, is, in, common, use, prior, to, 2010, when, the, renaming, came, into, effect, wallonia, could, sometimes, refer, to, the, territory, governed, by, the, walloon, region, whereas, walloon, region, referred, specifically, to, the, government, in, practice, the, difference, between, the, two, terms, is, small, and, what, is, meant, is, usually, clear, based, on, context, wallonia, is, a, cognate, of, terms, such, as, wales, cornwall, and, wallachia, the, germanic, word, walha, meaning, the, strangers, referred, to, gallic, or, celtic, people, wallonia, is, named, after, the, walloons, a, group, of, locals, who, natively, speak, romance, languages, in, middle, dutch, and, french, the, term, walloons, included, both, historical, secular, walloon, principalities, as, well, as, the, french, speaking, population, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, li, ge, or, the, whole, population, of, the, romanic, sprachraum, within, the, medieval, low, countries, julius, caesar, conquered, gaul, in, 57, bc, the, low, countries, became, part, of, the, larger, gallia, belgica, province, which, originally, stretched, from, southwestern, germany, to, normandy, and, the, southern, part, of, the, netherlands, the, population, of, this, territory, was, celtic, with, a, germanic, influence, which, was, stronger, in, the, north, than, in, the, south, of, the, province, gallia, belgica, became, progressively, romanized, the, ancestors, of, the, walloons, became, gallo, romans, and, were, called, the, walha, by, their, germanic, neighbours, the, walha, abandoned, their, celtic, dialects, and, started, to, speak, vulgar, latin, the, merovingian, franks, gradually, gained, control, of, the, region, during, the, 5th, century, under, clovis, due, to, the, fragmentation, of, the, former, roman, empire, vulgar, latin, regionally, developed, along, different, lines, and, evolved, into, several, langue, d, o, l, dialects, which, in, wallonia, became, picard, walloon, and, lorrain, the, oldest, surviving, text, written, in, a, langue, d, o, l, the, sequence, of, saint, eulalia, has, characteristics, of, these, three, languages, and, was, likely, written, in, or, very, near, to, what, is, now, wallonia, around, 880, ad, from, the, 4th, to, the, 7th, century, the, franks, established, several, settlements, probably, mostly, in, the, north, of, the, province, where, the, romanization, was, less, advanced, and, some, germanic, trace, was, still, present, the, language, border, that, now, splits, belgium, in, the, middle, began, to, crystallize, between, 700, under, the, reign, of, the, merovingians, and, carolingians, and, around, 1000, after, the, ottonian, renaissance, french, speaking, cities, with, li, ge, as, the, largest, one, appeared, along, the, meuse, while, gallo, roman, cities, such, as, tongeren, maastricht, and, aachen, became, germanized, the, carolingian, dynasty, dethroned, the, merovingians, in, the, 8th, century, in, 843, the, treaty, of, verdun, gave, the, territory, of, present, day, wallonia, to, middle, francia, which, would, shortly, fragment, with, the, region, passing, to, lotharingia, on, lotharingia, s, breakup, in, 959, the, present, day, territory, of, belgium, became, part, of, lower, lotharingia, which, then, fragmented, into, rival, principalities, and, duchies, by, 1190, literary, latin, which, was, taught, in, schools, lost, its, hegemony, during, the, 13th, century, and, was, replaced, by, old, french, in, the, 15th, century, the, dukes, of, burgundy, took, over, the, low, countries, the, death, of, charles, the, bold, in, 1477, raised, the, issue, of, succession, and, the, li, geois, took, advantage, of, this, to, regain, some, of, their, autonomy, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, century, the, low, countries, were, governed, successively, by, the, habsburg, dynasty, of, spain, from, the, early, 16th, century, until, 1713, 14, and, later, by, austria, until, 1794, this, territory, was, enlarged, in, 1521, 22, when, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, gained, the, tournai, region, from, france, present, day, belgium, was, conquered, in, 1795, by, the, french, republic, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, it, was, annexed, to, the, republic, which, later, became, the, napoleonic, empire, after, the, battle, of, waterloo, wallonia, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, under, king, william, of, orange, the, walloons, played, an, active, part, in, the, belgian, revolution, in, 1830, the, provisional, government, of, belgium, proclaimed, belgium, s, independence, and, held, elections, for, the, national, congress, in, the, 19th, century, the, area, began, to, industrialize, and, wallonia, was, the, first, fully, industrialized, area, in, continental, europe, this, brought, the, region, great, economic, prosperity, which, was, not, mirrored, in, poorer, flanders, and, the, result, was, a, large, amount, of, flemish, immigration, to, wallonia, belgium, was, divided, into, two, divergent, communities, on, the, one, hand, the, very, catholic, flemish, society, was, characterized, by, an, economy, centred, on, agriculture, on, the, other, hand, wallonia, was, the, centre, of, the, continental, european, industrial, revolution, where, classical, liberal, and, socialist, movements, were, rapidly, emerging, major, strikes, and, general, strikes, took, place, in, wallonia, including, the, walloon, jacquerie, of, 1886, the, belgian, general, strikes, of, 1893, 1902, 1913, for, universal, suffrage, 1932, depicted, in, mis, re, au, borinage, and, 1936, after, world, war, ii, major, strikes, included, the, general, strike, against, leopold, iii, of, belgium, 1950, and, the, 1960, 1961, winter, general, strike, for, autonomy, for, wallonia, the, profitability, of, the, heavy, industries, to, which, wallonia, owed, its, prosperity, started, declining, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, centre, of, industrial, activity, shifted, north, to, flanders, the, loss, of, prosperity, caused, social, unrest, and, wallonia, sought, greater, autonomy, in, order, to, address, its, economic, problems, in, the, wake, of, the, 1960, 1961, winter, general, strike, the, process, of, state, reform, in, belgium, got, underway, this, reform, started, partly, with, the, linguistic, laws, of, 1962, 63, which, defined, the, four, language, areas, within, the, constitution, but, the, strikes, of, 1960, which, took, place, in, wallonia, more, than, in, flanders, are, not, principally, linked, with, the, four, language, areas, nor, with, the, communities, but, with, the, regions, in, 1968, the, conflict, between, the, communities, burst, out, french, speakers, in, flanders, who, were, not, necessarily, walloons, were, driven, out, of, most, notably, the, leuven, based, catholic, university, amid, shouts, of, walen, buiten, walloons, out, after, a, formal, split, of, the, university, in, two, and, the, creation, of, a, brand, new, campus, in, wallonia, a, wider, series, of, state, reforms, was, passed, in, belgium, which, resulted, in, the, federalisation, of, the, nation, and, the, creation, of, the, walloon, region, and, the, french, community, comprising, both, wallonia, and, brussels, administrative, entities, each, of, which, would, gain, various, levels, of, considerable, autonomy, wallonia, is,

period, but, their, output, was, small, and, was, principally, consumed, as, fuel, by, various, industries, such, as, the, important, glassmaking, industry, that, sprang, up, in, the, charleroi, basin, during, the, 14th, century, in, the, 19th, century, the, area, began, to, industrialize, mainly, along, the, so, called, sillon, industriel, it, was, the, first, fully, industrialized, area,

the, coal, was, running, out, and, the, cost, of, extracting, coal, was, constantly, rising, it, was, the, end, of, an, era, and, wallonia, has, been, making, efforts, to, redefine, itself, the, restoration, of, economical, development, is, high, on, the, political, agenda, and, the, government, is, encouraging, development, of, industries, notably, in, cutting, edge, technology, and, in, business, parks, the, economy, is, improving, but, wallonia, is, not, yet, at, the, level, of, flanders, and, is, still, suffering, from, difficulties, the, current, walloon, economy, is, relatively, diversified, although, certain, areas, especially, around, charleroi, and, li, ge, are, still, suffering, from, the, steel, industry, crisis, with, an, unemployment, rate, of, up, to, 30, percent,

issues, although, in, flanders, the, flemish, region, assigned, all, of, its, powers, to, the, flemish, community, the, walloon, region, remains, in, principle, distinct, from, and, independent, from, the, french, community, and, vice, versa, despite, this, the, french, community, s, parliament, is, almost, entirely, composed, of, members, of, wallonia, s, and, brussels, parliaments, so, the, bodies, are, governed, by, the, same, individuals, additionally, the, french, community, of, belgium, has, controversially, begun, referring, to, itself, exclusively, as, the, wallonia, brussels,
