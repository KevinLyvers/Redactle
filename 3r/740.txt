nowadays, it, is, one, of, the, most, decentralised, regions, in, the, world, in, this, regard, it, has, been, described, as, having, more, autonomy, than, just, about, any, other, in, europe, by, the, economist, as, regards, the, bounds, to, the, spanish, constitution, basque, nationalists, cite, the, fact, that, in, the, 1978, spanish, constitution, referendum, which, was, passed, with, a, majority, of, votes, and, a, poor, turnout, in, this, area, the, basque, country, had, the, highest, abstention, the, basque, nationalist, party, had, endorsed, abstention, on, the, grounds, that,

the, state, all, in, all, many, basques, believe, that, they, are, not, bound, to, a, constitution, that, they, never, endorsed, the, statute, of, autonomy, of, the, basque, country, is, an, organic, law, but, powers, have, been, devolved, gradually, during, decades, according, to, re, negotiations, between, the, spanish, and, the, consecutive, basque, regional, governments, to, reach, an, effective, implementation, while, the, transfer, of, many, powers, are, still, due, and, has, always, been, a, matter, of, heated, political, discussion, basque, nationalists, often, put, down, this,
