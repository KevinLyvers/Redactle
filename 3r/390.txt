denali, d, n, l, i, also, known, as, mount, mckinley, its, former, official, name, is, the, highest, mountain, peak, in, north, america, with, a, summit, elevation, of, 20, 310, feet, 6, 190, m, above, sea, level, it, is, the, tallest, mountain, in, the, world, from, base, to, peak, on, land, measuring, 18, 000, ft, 5, 500, m, with, a, topographic, prominence, of, 20, 194, feet, 6, 155, m, and, a, topographic, isolation, the, distance, to, the, nearest, peak, of, equal, or, greater, height, of, 4, 621, 1, miles, 7, 436, 9, km, denali, is, the, third, most, prominent, and, third, most, isolated, peak, on, earth, after, mount, everest, and, aconcagua, located, in, the, alaska, range, in, the, interior, of, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, denali, is, the, centerpiece, of, denali, national, park, and, preserve, the, koyukon, people, who, inhabit, the, area, around, the, mountain, have, referred, to, the, peak, as, denali, for, centuries, in, 1896, a, gold, prospector, named, it, mount, mckinley, in, support, of, then, presidential, candidate, william, mckinley, who, later, became, the, 25th, president, mckinley, s, name, was, the, official, name, recognized, by, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, from, 1917, until, 2015, in, august, 2015, 40, years, after, alaska, had, done, so, the, united, states, department, of, the, interior, announced, the, change, of, the, official, name, of, the, mountain, to, denali, in, 1903, james, wickersham, recorded, the, first, attempt, at, climbing, denali, which, was, unsuccessful, in, 1906, frederick, cook, claimed, the, first, ascent, but, this, ascent, is, unverified, and, its, legitimacy, questioned, the, first, verifiable, ascent, to, denali, s, summit, was, achieved, on, june, 7, 1913, by, climbers, hudson, stuck, harry, karstens, walter, harper, and, robert, tatum, who, went, by, the, south, summit, in, 1951, bradford, washburn, pioneered, the, west, buttress, route, considered, to, be, the, safest, and, easiest, route, and, therefore, the, most, popular, currently, in, use, on, september, 2, 2015, the, u, s, geological, survey, measured, the, mountain, at, 20, 310, feet, 6, 190, m, high, 10, ft, lower, than, the, 20, 320, feet, 6, 194, m, measured, in, 1952, using, photogrammetry, denali, is, a, granitic, pluton, mostly, pink, quartz, monzonite, lifted, by, tectonic, pressure, from, the, subduction, of, the, pacific, plate, beneath, the, north, american, plate, at, the, same, time, the, sedimentary, material, above, and, around, the, mountain, was, stripped, away, by, erosion, the, forces, that, lifted, denali, also, caused, many, deep, earthquakes, in, alaska, and, the, aleutian, islands, the, pacific, plate, is, seismically, active, beneath, denali, a, tectonic, region, that, is, known, as, the, mckinley, cluster, the, high, topography, of, denali, is, related, to, the, complex, structural, relationships, created, by, the, right, lateral, denali, fault, and, denali, fault, bend, the, denali, fault, is, caused, by, stresses, created, by, the, low, angle, subduction, of, the, yakutat, microplate, underneath, alaska, the, denali, fault, bend, is, characterized, as, a, gentle, restraining, bend, the, denali, fault, bend, represents, a, curvature, in, the, denali, fault, that, is, approximately, 75, km, long, this, curvature, creates, what, is, known, as, a, space, problem, as, the, right, lateral, movement, along, the, denali, fault, continues, high, compressional, forces, created, at, the, fault, bend, essentially, push, the, crust, up, in, a, vertical, fashion, the, longer, the, crust, stays, within, the, restraining, bend, the, higher, the, topography, will, be, several, active, normal, faults, north, of, the, restraining, bend, have, recently, been, mapped, with, slip, rates, of, approximately, 2, 6, mm, year, these, normal, faults, help, to, accommodate, the, unusual, curvature, of, the, restraining, bend, denali, has, a, summit, elevation, of, 20, 310, feet, 6, 190, m, above, sea, level, making, it, the, highest, peak, in, north, america, and, the, northernmost, mountain, above, 19, 685, feet, 6, 000, m, elevation, in, the, world, measured, from, base, to, peak, at, some, 18, 000, ft, 5, 500, m, it, is, among, the, largest, mountains, situated, entirely, above, sea, level, denali, rises, from, a, sloping, plain, with, elevations, from, 1, 000, to, 3, 000, ft, 300, to, 910, m, for, a, base, to, peak, height, of, 17, 000, to, 19, 000, ft, 5, 000, to, 6, 000, m, by, comparison, mount, everest, rises, from, the, tibetan, plateau, at, a, much, higher, base, elevation, base, elevations, for, everest, range, from, 13, 800, ft, 4, 200, m, on, the, south, side, to, 17, 100, ft, 5, 200, m, on, the, tibetan, plateau, for, a, base, to, peak, height, in, the, range, of, 12, 000, to, 15, 300, ft, 3, 700, to, 4, 700, m, denali, s, base, to, peak, height, is, little, more, than, half, the, 33, 500, ft, 10, 200, m, of, the, volcano, mauna, kea, which, lies, mostly, under, water, denali, has, two, significant, summits, the, south, summit, is, the, higher, one, while, the, north, summit, has, an, elevation, of, 19, 470, ft, 5, 934, m, and, a, prominence, of, approximately, 1, 270, ft, 387, m, the, north, summit, is, sometimes, counted, as, a, separate, peak, see, e, g, fourteener, and, sometimes, not, it, is, rarely, climbed, except, by, those, doing, routes, on, the, north, side, of, the, massif, five, large, glaciers, flow, off, the, slopes, of, the, mountain, the, peters, glacier, lies, on, the, northwest, side, of, the, massif, while, the, muldrow, glacier, falls, from, its, northeast, slopes, just, to, the, east, of, the, muldrow, and, abutting, the, eastern, side, of, the, massif, is, the, traleika, glacier, the, ruth, glacier, lies, to, the, southeast, of, the, mountain, and, the, kahiltna, glacier, leads, up, to, the, southwest, side, of, the, mountain, with, a, length, of, 44, mi, 71, km, the, kahiltna, glacier, is, the, longest, glacier, in, the, alaska, range, the, koyukon, athabaskans, who, inhabit, the, area, around, the, mountain, have, for, centuries, referred, to, the, peak, as, dinale, or, denali, the, name, is, based, on, a, koyukon, word, for, high, or, tall, during, the, russian, ownership, of, alaska, the, common, name, for, the, mountain, was, bolshaya, gora, russian, bolshaya, big, gora, mountain, which, is, the, russian, translation, of, denali, it, was, briefly, called, densmore, s, mountain, in, the, late, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, after, frank, densmore, a, gold, prospector, who, was, the, first, non, native, alaskan, to, reach, the, base, of, the, mountain, in, 1896, a, gold, prospector, named, it, mckinley, as, political, support, for, then, presidential, candidate, william, mckinley, who, became, president, the, following, year, the, united, states, formally, recognized, the, name, mount, mckinley, after, president, wilson, signed, the, mount, mckinley, national, park, act, of, february, 26, 1917, in, 1965, lyndon, b, johnson, declared, the, north, and, south, peaks, of, the, mountain, the, churchill, peaks, in, honor, of, british, statesman, winston, churchill, the, alaska, board, of, geographic, names, changed, the, name, of, the, mountain, to, denali, in, 1975, which, was, how, it, is, called, locally, however, a, request, in, 1975, from, the, alaska, state, legislature, to, the, united, states, board, on, geographic, names, to, do, the, same, at, the, federal, level, was, blocked, by, ohio, congressman, ralph, regula, whose, district, included, mckinley, s, home, town, of, canton, on, august, 30, 2015, just, ahead, of, a, presidential, visit, to, alaska, the, barack, obama, administration, announced, the, name, denali, would, be, restored, in, line, with, the, alaska, geographic, board, s, designation, u, s, secretary, of, the, interior, sally, jewell, issued, the, order, changing, the, name, to, denali, on, august, 28, 2015, effective, immediately, jewell, said, the, change, had, been, a, long, time, coming, the, renaming, of, the, mountain, received, praise, from, alaska, s, senior, u, s, senator, lisa, murkowski, r, ak, who, had, previously, introduced, legislation, to, accomplish, the, name, change, but, it, drew, criticism, from, several, politicians, from, president, mckinley, s, home, state, of, ohio, such, as, governor, john, kasich, u, s, senator, rob, portman, u, s, house, speaker, john, boehner, and, representative, bob, gibbs, who, described, obama, s, action, as, constitutional, overreach, because, he, said, an, act, of, congress, was, required, to, rename, the, mountain, the, alaska, dispatch, news, reported, that, the, secretary, of, the, interior, has, authority, under, federal, law, to, change, geographic, names, when, the, board, of, geographic, names, does, not, act, on, a, naming, request, within, a, reasonable, period, of, time, jewell, told, the, alaska, dispatch, news, that, i, think, any, of, us, would, think, that, 40, years, is, an, unreasonable, amount, of, time, indigenous, names, for, denali, can, be, found, in, seven, different, alaskan, languages, the, names, fall, into, two, categories, to, the, south, of, the, alaska, range, in, the, dena, ina, and, ahtna, languages, the, mountain, is, known, by, names, that, are, translated, as, big, mountain, to, the, north, of, the, alaska, range, in, the, lower, tanana, koyukon, upper, kuskokwim, holikachuk, and, deg, xinag, languages, the, mountain, is, known, by, names, that, are, translated, as, the, high, one, the, tall, one, koyukon, lower, and, middle, tanana, upper, kuskokwim, deg, xinag, and, holikachuk, asked, about, the, importance, of, the, mountain, and, its, name, will, mayo, former, president, of, the, tanana, chiefs, conference, an, organization, that, represents, 42, athabaskan, tribes, in, the, alaskan, interior, said, it, s, not, one, homogeneous, belief, structure, around, the, mountain, but, we, all, agree, that, we, re, all, deeply, gratified, by, the, acknowledgment, of, the, importance, of, denali, to, alaska, s, people, the, following, table, lists, the, alaskan, athabascan, names, for, denali, the, koyukon, athabaskans, living, in, the, yukon, tanana, and, kuskokwim, basins, were, the, first, native, americans, with, access, to, the, flanks, of, the, mountain, a, british, naval, captain, and, explorer, george, vancouver, is, the, first, european, on, record, to, have, sighted, denali, when, he, noted, distant, stupendous, mountains, while, surveying, the, knik, arm, of, the, cook, inlet, on, may, 6, 1794, the, russian, explorer, lavrenty, zagoskin, explored, the, tanana, and, kuskokwim, rivers, in, 1843, and, 1844, and, was, likely, the, first, european, to, sight, the, mountain, from, the, other, side, william, dickey, a, new, hampshire, born, resident, of, seattle, washington, who, had, been, digging, for, gold, in, the, sands, of, the, susitna, river, wrote, after, his, returning, from, alaska, an, account, in, the, new, york, sun, that, appeared, on, january, 24, 1897, his, report, drew, attention, with, the, sentence, we, have, no, doubt, that, this, peak, is, the, highest, in, north, america, and, estimate, that, it, is, over, 20, 000, feet, 6, 100, m, high, until, then, mount, logan, in, canada, s, yukon, territory, was, believed, to, be, the, continent, s, highest, point, though, later, praised, for, his, estimate, dickey, admitted, that, other, prospector, parties, had, also, guessed, the, mountain, to, be, over, 20, 000, feet, 6, 100, m, these, estimates, were, confirmed, in, 1898, by, the, surveyor, robert, muldrow, who, measured, its, elevation, as, 20, 300, feet, 6, 200, m, on, november, 5, 2012, the, united, states, mint, released, a, twenty, five, cent, piece, depicting, denali, national, park, it, is, the, fifteenth, of, the, america, the, beautiful, quarters, series, the, reverse, features, a, dall, sheep, with, the, peak, of, denali, in, the, background, during, the, summer, of, 1902, scientist, alfred, brooks, explored, the, flanks, of, the, mountain, as, a, part, of, an, exploratory, surveying, party, conducted, by, the, u, s, geological, survey, the, party, landed, at, cook, inlet, in, late, may, then, traveled, east, paralleling, the, alaska, range, before, reaching, the, slopes, of, denali, in, early, august, camped, on, the, flank, of, the, mountain, on, august, 3, brooks, noted, later, that, while, the, ascent, of, mount, mckinley, had, never, been, part, of, our, plans, the, party, decided, to, delay, one, day, so, that, we, might, actually, set, foot, on, the, slopes, of, the, mountain, setting, off, alone, with, good, weather, on, august, 4, brooks, aimed, to, reach, a, 10, 000, feet, 3, 048, m, shoulder, at, 7, 500, feet, 2, 286, m, brooks, found, his, way, blocked, by, sheer, ice, and, after, leaving, a, small, cairn, as, a, marker, descended, after, the, party, s, return, brooks, co, authored, a, plan, for, climbing, mt, mckinley, published, in, national, geographic, magazine, in, january, 1903, with, fellow, party, member, and, topographer, d, l, raeburn, in, which, they, suggested, that, future, attempts, at, the, summit, should, approach, from, the, north, not, the, south, the, report, received, substantial, attention, and, within, a, year, two, climbing, parties, declared, their, intent, to, summit, during, the, early, summer, of, 1903, judge, james, wickersham, then, of, eagle, alaska, made, the, first, recorded, attempt, to, climb, denali, along, with, a, party, of, four, others, the, group, attempted, to, get, as, close, to, the, mountain, as, possible, via, the, kantishna, river, by, steamer, before, offloading, and, following, chitsia, creek, with, a, poling, boat, mules, and, backpacks, a, route, suggested, to, them, by, tanana, athabaskan, people, they, met, along, the, way, the, party, received, further, navigational, assistance, at, anotoktilon, an, athabaskan, hunting, camp, where, residents, gave, the, group, detailed, directions, to, reach, the, glaciers, at, the, foot, of, denali, on, reaching, the, mountain, the, mountaineers, set, up, base, camp, on, the, lower, portion, of, peters, glacier, aiming, for, the, northwest, buttress, of, denali, s, north, peak, they, attempted, to, ascend, directly, however, crevasses, ice, fall, and, the, lack, of, a, clear, passage, caused, them, to, turn, and, attempt, to, follow, a, spur, via, jeffery, glacier, where, they, believed, they, could, see, a, way, to, the, summit, after, a, dangerous, ascent, at, around, 10, 000, feet, 3, 048, m, wickersham, found, that, the, route, did, not, connect, as, it, had, appeared, from, below, instead, discovering, a, tremendous, precipice, beyond, which, we, cannot, go, our, only, line, of, further, ascent, would, be, to, climb, the, vertical, wall, of, the, mountain, at, our, left, and, that, is, impossible, this, wall, now, known, as, the, wickersham, wall, juts, 15, 000, feet, 4, 572, m, upwards, from, the, glacier, to, the, north, peak, of, denali, because, of, the, route, s, history, of, avalanche, danger, it, was, not, successfully, climbed, until, 1963, later, in, the, summer, of, 1903, dr, frederick, cook, directed, a, team, of, five, men, on, another, attempt, at, the, summit, cook, was, already, an, experienced, explorer, and, had, been, a, party, member, on, successful, arctic, expeditions, commanded, both, by, robert, peary, and, roald, amundsen, yet, he, struggled, to, obtain, funding, for, his, own, expedition, eventually, organizing, it, on, a, shoestring, budget, without, any, other, experienced, climbers, the, party, navigated, up, the, cook, inlet, and, followed, the, path, of, the, 1902, brooks, party, towards, denali, cook, approached, the, mountain, via, the, peters, glacier, as, wickersham, had, done, however, he, was, able, to, overcome, the, ice, fall, that, had, caused, the, previous, group, to, turn, up, the, spur, towards, the, wickersham, wall, despite, avoiding, this, obstacle, on, august, 31, having, reached, an, elevation, of, about, 10, 900, feet, 3, 322, m, on, the, northwest, buttress, of, the, north, peak, the, party, found, they, had, reached, a, dead, end, and, could, make, no, further, progress, on, the, descent, the, group, completely, circumnavigated, the, mountain, the, first, climbing, party, to, do, so, although, cook, s, 1903, expedition, did, not, reach, the, summit, he, received, acclaim, for, the, accomplishment, a, 1, 000, miles, 1, 609, km, trek, in, which, he, not, only, circled, the, entire, mountain, but, also, found, on, the, descent, an, accessible, pass, northeast, of, the, muldrow, glacier, following, the, headwaters, of, the, toklat, and, chulitna, rivers, in, 1906, cook, initiated, another, expedition, to, denali, with, co, leader, herschel, parker, a, columbia, university, professor, of, electrical, engineering, with, extensive, mountaineering, experience, belmore, browne, an, experienced, climber, and, five, other, men, comprised, the, rest, of, the, group, cook, and, parker, s, group, spent, most, of, the, summer, season, exploring, the, southern, and, southeastern, approaches, to, the, mountain, eventually, reaching, a, high, point, on, tokositna, glacier, 25, miles, 40, km, from, the, summit, during, their, explorations, the, party, mapped, out, many, of, the, tributaries, and, glaciers, of, the, susitna, river, along, the, mountain, s, south, flank, as, the, summer, ended, the, team, retreated, to, the, coast, and, began, to, disperse, in, september, 1906, cook, and, a, single, party, member, horseman, robert, barrill, journeyed, towards, the, summit, again, in, what, cook, later, described, as, a, last, desperate, attempt, in, a, telegram, to, his, financial, backers, cook, and, barrill, spent, 12, days, in, total, on, the, attempt, and, claimed, to, have, reached, the, summit, via, the, ruth, glacier, upon, hearing, cook, s, claims, parker, and, browne, were, immediately, suspicious, browne, later, wrote, that, he, knew, cook, s, claims, were, lies, just, as, any, new, yorker, would, know, that, no, man, could, walk, from, the, brooklyn, bridge, to, grant, s, tomb, in, ten, minutes, in, may, 1907, harper, s, magazine, published, cook, s, account, of, the, climb, along, with, a, photograph, of, what, appeared, to, be, barrill, standing, on, the, summit, by, 1909, barrill, had, recanted, at, least, part, of, his, story, about, the, climb, and, others, publicly, questioned, the, account, however, cook, continued, to, assert, his, claim, the, controversy, continued, for, decades, in, 1956, mountaineers, bradford, washburn, and, walter, gonnason, tried, to, settle, the, matter, with, gonnason, attempting, to, follow, cook, s, purported, route, to, the, summit, washburn, noted, inconsistencies, between, cook, s, account, of, locations, of, glaciers, and, found, a, spot, at, 5, 400, feet, 1, 646, m, and, 19, miles, 31, km, southeast, of, the, summit, that, appeared, identical, to, the, supposed, summit, image, gonnason, was, not, able, to, complete, the, climb, but, because, he, was, turned, back, by, poor, weather, felt, that, this, did, not, definitely, disprove, cook, s, story, in, 1998, historian, robert, bryce, discovered, an, original, and, un, cropped, version, of, the, fake, peak, photograph, of, barrill, standing, on, the, promontory, it, showed, a, wider, view, of, surrounding, features, appearing, to, definitively, discount, cook, s, claim, given, the, skepticism, concerning, cook, s, story, interest, in, claiming, the, first, ascent, remained, miners, and, other, alaskans, living, in, kantishna, and, fairbanks, wanted, the, honors, to, go, to, local, men, in, 1909, four, alaska, residents, tom, lloyd, peter, anderson, billy, taylor, and, charles, mcgonagall, set, out, from, fairbanks, alaska, during, late, december, with, supplies, and, dogs, that, were, in, part, paid, for, by, bettors, in, a, fairbanks, tavern, by, march, 1910, the, men, had, established, a, base, camp, near, one, of, the, sites, where, the, brooks, party, had, been, and, pressed, on, from, the, north, via, the, muldrow, glacier, unlike, some, previous, expeditions, they, discovered, a, pass, since, named, mcgonagall, pass, which, allowed, them, to, bypass, the, wickersham, wall, and, access, the, higher, reaches, of, the, mountain, at, roughly, 11, 000, feet, 3, 353, m, tom, lloyd, old, and, less, physically, fit, than, the, others, stayed, behind, according, to, their, account, the, remaining, three, men, pioneered, a, route, following, karstens, ridge, around, the, harper, icefall, then, reached, the, upper, basin, before, ascending, to, pioneer, ridge, the, three, men, carried, a, 14, foot, long, 4, 3, m, spruce, pole, around, 19, 000, feet, 5, 791, m, charles, mcgonagall, older, and, having, exhausted, himself, carrying, the, spruce, pole, remained, behind, on, april, 3, 1910, billy, taylor, and, peter, anderson, scrambled, the, final, few, hundred, feet, to, reach, the, north, peak, of, denali, at, 19, 470, feet, 5, 934, m, high, the, shorter, of, the, two, peaks, the, pair, erected, the, pole, near, the, top, with, the, hope, that, it, would, be, visible, from, lower, reaches, to, prove, they, had, made, it, after, the, expedition, tom, lloyd, returned, to, fairbanks, while, the, three, others, remained, in, kantishna, to, mine, in, lloyd, s, recounting, all, four, men, made, it, to, the, top, of, not, only, the, north, peak, but, the, higher, south, peak, as, well, when, the, remaining, three, men, returned, to, town, with, conflicting, accounts, the, entire, expedition, s, legitimacy, was, questioned, several, years, later, another, climbing, group, would, claim, to, have, seen, the, spruce, pole, in, the, distance, supporting, their, north, peak, claim, however, some, continue, to, doubt, they, reached, the, summit, outside, of, the, single, later, climbing, group, who, were, friendly, with, some, of, the, sourdough, expedition, men, no, other, group, would, ever, see, it, jon, waterman, author, of, the, book, chasing, denali, which, explored, the, controversy, outlined, several, reasons, to, doubt, the, claim, there, was, never, any, photographic, evidence, the, four, men, climbed, during, the, winter, season, known, for, much, more, difficult, conditions, along, a, route, that, has, never, been, fully, replicated, they, were, inexperienced, climbers, ascending, without, any, of, the, usual, safety, gear, or, any, care, for, altitude, sickness, they, claimed, to, have, ascended, from, 11, 000, feet, 3, 353, m, to, the, top, in, less, than, 18, hours, unheard, of, at, a, time, when, siege, style, alpinism, was, the, norm, yet, waterman, says, these, guys, were, men, of, the, trail, they, didn, t, care, what, anybody, thought, they, were, just, tough, sobs, he, noted, that, the, men, were, largely, unlettered, and, that, some, of, the, ensuing, doubt, was, related, to, their, lack, of, sophistication, in, dealing, with, the, press, and, the, contemporary, climbing, establishment, in, 1912, the, parker, browne, expedition, nearly, reached, the, summit, turning, back, within, just, a, few, hundred, yards, meters, of, it, due, to, harsh, weather, on, july, 7, the, day, after, their, descent, a, 7, 4, magnitude, earthquake, shattered, the, glacier, they, had, ascended, the, first, ascent, of, the, main, summit, of, denali, came, on, june, 7, 1913, by, a, party, directed, by, hudson, stuck, and, harry, karstens, along, with, walter, harper, and, robert, tatum, karstens, relocated, to, alaska, in, the, gold, rush, of, 1897, and, in, subsequent, years, became, involved, in, a, variety, of, endeavors, beyond, mining, including, helping, establish, dog, mushing, routes, to, deliver, mail, across, vast, swathes, of, territory, and, supporting, expeditions, led, by, naturalist, charles, sheldon, near, the, base, of, denali, stuck, was, an, english, born, episcopal, priest, who, came, to, alaska, by, chance, he, became, acclimated, to, the, often, harsh, alaskan, environment, because, of, his, many, travels, between, far, flung, outposts, within, his, district, climbing, mountains, as, a, hobby, at, 21, years, old, harper, was, already, known, as, a, skilled, and, strong, outdoorsman, the, alaska, born, son, of, a, koyukon, athabascan, mother, and, irish, gold, prospector, father, tatum, also, 21, years, old, was, a, theology, student, working, at, a, tanana, mission, and, the, least, experienced, of, the, team, his, primary, responsibility, on, the, trip, was, as, a, cook, the, team, approached, the, peak, from, the, north, via, the, muldrow, glacier, and, mcgonagall, pass, while, ferrying, loads, up, to, a, camp, at, around, 10, 800, feet, 3, 292, m, they, suffered, a, setback, when, a, stray, match, accidentally, set, fire, to, some, supplies, including, several, tents, the, prior, year, s, earthquake, had, left, what, had, previously, been, described, by, the, parker, browne, expedition, as, a, gentle, slope, ascended, in, no, more, than, three, days, as, a, dangerous, ice, strewn, morass, on, a, knife, edged, ridge, later, named, karstens, ridge, it, would, take, the, team, three, weeks, to, cover, the, same, ground, as, karstens, and, harper, laboriously, cut, steps, into, the, ice, on, may, 30, the, team, with, the, help, of, some, good, weather, ascended, to, a, new, high, camp, situated, at, 17, 500, feet, 5, 334, m, in, the, grand, basin, between, the, north, and, south, peaks, on, june, 7, the, team, made, the, summit, attempt, temperatures, were, below, 20, f, 29, c, at, times, every, man, and, particularly, stuck, suffered, from, altitude, sickness, by, midday, harper, became, the, first, climber, to, reach, the, summit, followed, seconds, later, by, tatum, and, karstens, stuck, arrived, last, falling, unconscious, on, the, summit, using, the, mountain, s, contemporary, name, tatum, later, commented, the, view, from, the, top, of, mount, mckinley, is, like, looking, out, the, windows, of, heaven, during, the, climb, stuck, spotted, via, binoculars, the, presence, of, a, large, pole, near, the, north, summit, this, report, confirmed, the, sourdough, ascent, and, it, is, widely, believed, presently, that, the, sourdoughs, did, succeed, on, the, north, summit, however, the, pole, was, never, seen, before, or, since, so, there, is, still, some, doubt, stuck, also, discovered, that, the, parker, browne, party, were, only, about, 200, feet, 61, m, of, elevation, short, of, the, true, summit, when, they, turned, back, stuck, and, karstens, team, achieved, the, uncontroversial, first, ascent, of, denali, s, south, peak, however, the, news, was, met, with, muted, interest, by, the, wider, climbing, community, appalachia, journal, then, the, official, journal, of, the, american, alpine, club, published, a, small, notice, of, the, accomplishment, a, year, later, the, mountain, is, climbed, regularly, nowadays, in, 2003, around, 58, of, climbers, reached, the, top, but, by, that, time, the, mountain, had, claimed, the, lives, of, nearly, 100, mountaineers, the, vast, majority, of, climbers, use, the, west, buttress, route, pioneered, in, 1951, by, bradford, washburn, after, an, extensive, aerial, photographic, analysis, of, the, mountain, climbers, typically, take, two, to, four, weeks, to, ascend, denali, it, is, one, of, the, seven, summits, summiting, all, of, them, is, a, challenge, for, mountaineers, on, august, 4, 2018, five, people, died, in, the, k2, aviation, de, havilland, beaver, dhc, 2, crash, near, denali, from, 1947, to, 2018, in, the, united, states, 2, 799, people, were, reported, to, be, involved, in, mountaineering, accidents, and, 11, of, these, accidents, occurred, on, denali, of, these, 2, 799, accidents, 43, resulted, in, death, and, 8, of, these, deaths, occurred, on, denali, the, japanese, alpine, club, installed, a, meteorological, station, on, a, ridge, near, the, summit, of, denali, at, an, elevation, of, 18, 733, feet, 5, 710, m, in, 1990, in, 1998, this, weather, station, was, donated, to, the, international, arctic, research, center, at, the, university, of, alaska, fairbanks, in, june, 2002, a, weather, station, was, placed, at, the, 19, 000, foot, 5, 800, m, level, this, weather, station, was, designed, to, transmit, data, in, real, time, for, use, by, the, climbing, public, and, the, science, community, since, its, establishment, annual, upgrades, to, the, equipment, have, been, performed, with, instrumentation, custom, built, for, the, extreme, weather, and, altitude, conditions, this, weather, station, is, the, third, highest, weather, station, in, the, world, the, weather, station, recorded, a, temperature, of, 75, 5, f, 59, 7, c, on, december, 1, 2003, on, the, previous, day, of, november, 30, 2003, a, temperature, of, 74, 4, f, 59, 1, c, combined, with, a, wind, speed, of, 18, 4, miles, per, hour, 29, 6, km, h, to, produce, a, north, american, record, windchill, of, 118, 1, f, 83, 4, c, even, in, july, this, weather, station, has, recorded, temperatures, as, low, as, 22, 9, f, 30, 5, c, and, windchills, as, low, as, 59, 2, f, 50, 7, c, according, to, the, national, park, service, in, 1932, the, liek, lindley, expedition, recovered, a, self, recording, minimum, thermometer, left, near, browne, s, tower, at, about, 15, 000, feet, 4, 600, m, on, denali, by, the, stuck, karstens, party, in, 1913, the, spirit, thermometer, was, calibrated, down, to, 95, f, 71, c, and, the, lowest, recorded, temperature, was, below, that, point, harry, j, liek, took, the, thermometer, back, to, washington, d, c, where, it, was, tested, by, the, united, states, weather, bureau, and, found, to, be, accurate, the, lowest, temperature, that, it, had, recorded, was, found, to, be, approximately, 100, f, 73, c, another, thermometer, was, placed, at, the, 15, 000, foot, 4, 600, m, level, by, the, u, s, army, natick, laboratory, and, was, there, from, 1950, to, 1969, the, lowest, temperature, recorded, during, that, period, was, also, 100, f, 73, c, besides, the, north, summit, mentioned, above, other, features, on, the, massif, which, are, sometimes, included, as, separate, peaks, are, nearby, peaks, include
