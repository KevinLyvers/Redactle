unrecognised, states, the, black, sea, is, a, marginal, mediterranean, sea, lying, between, europe, and, asia, east, of, the, balkans, south, of, the, east, european, plain, west, of, the, caucasus, and, north, of, anatolia, it, is, bounded, by, bulgaria, georgia, romania, russia, turkey, and, ukraine, the, black, sea, is, supplied, by, major, rivers, principally, the, danube, dnieper, and, dniester, consequently, while, six, countries, have, a, coastline, on, the, sea, its, drainage, basin, includes, parts, of, 24, countries, in, europe, the, black, sea, not, including, the, sea, of, azov, covers, 436, 400, km, 2, 168, 500, sq, mi, has, a, maximum, depth, of, 2, 212, m, 7, 257, ft, and, a, volume, of, 547, 000, km, 3, 131, 000, cu, mi, most, of, its, coasts, ascend, rapidly, these, rises, are, the, pontic, mountains, to, the, south, bar, the, southwest, facing, peninsulas, the, caucasus, mountains, to, the, east, and, the, crimean, mountains, to, the, mid, north, in, the, west, the, coast, is, generally, small, floodplains, below, foothills, such, as, the, strandzha, cape, emine, a, dwindling, of, the, east, end, of, the, balkan, mountains, and, the, dobruja, plateau, considerably, farther, north, the, longest, east, west, extent, is, about, 1, 175, km, 730, mi, important, cities, along, the, coast, include, clockwise, from, the, bosporus, burgas, varna, constan, a, odesa, sevastopol, novorossiysk, sochi, poti, batumi, trabzon, and, samsun, the, black, sea, has, a, positive, water, balance, with, an, annual, net, outflow, of, 300, km, 3, 72, cu, mi, per, year, through, the, bosporus, and, the, dardanelles, into, the, aegean, sea, while, the, net, flow, of, water, through, the, bosporus, and, dardanelles, known, collectively, as, the, turkish, straits, is, out, of, the, black, sea, water, generally, flows, in, both, directions, simultaneously, denser, more, saline, water, from, the, aegean, flows, into, the, black, sea, underneath, the, less, dense, fresher, water, that, flows, out, of, the, black, sea, this, creates, a, significant, and, permanent, layer, of, deep, water, that, does, not, drain, or, mix, and, is, therefore, anoxic, this, anoxic, layer, is, responsible, for, the, preservation, of, ancient, shipwrecks, which, have, been, found, in, the, black, sea, which, ultimately, drains, into, the, mediterranean, sea, via, the, turkish, straits, and, the, aegean, sea, the, bosporus, strait, connects, it, to, the, small, sea, of, marmara, which, in, turn, is, connected, to, the, aegean, sea, via, the, strait, of, the, dardanelles, to, the, north, the, black, sea, is, connected, to, the, sea, of, azov, by, the, kerch, strait, the, water, level, has, varied, significantly, over, geological, time, due, to, these, variations, in, the, water, level, in, the, basin, the, surrounding, shelf, and, associated, aprons, have, sometimes, been, dry, land, at, certain, critical, water, levels, connections, with, surrounding, water, bodies, can, become, established, it, is, through, the, most, active, of, these, connective, routes, the, turkish, straits, that, the, black, sea, joins, the, world, ocean, during, geological, periods, when, this, hydrological, link, was, not, present, the, black, sea, was, an, endorheic, basin, operating, independently, of, the, global, ocean, system, similar, to, the, caspian, sea, today, currently, the, black, sea, water, level, is, relatively, high, thus, water, is, being, exchanged, with, the, mediterranean, the, black, sea, undersea, river, is, a, current, of, particularly, saline, water, flowing, through, the, bosporus, strait, and, along, the, seabed, of, the, black, sea, the, first, of, its, kind, discovered, current, names, of, the, sea, are, usually, equivalents, of, the, english, name, black, sea, including, these, given, in, the, countries, bordering, the, sea, such, names, have, not, yet, been, shown, conclusively, to, predate, the, 13th, century, in, greece, the, historical, name, euxine, sea, which, holds, a, different, literal, meaning, see, below, is, still, widely, used, the, black, sea, is, one, of, four, seas, named, in, english, after, common, color, terms, the, others, being, the, red, sea, the, white, sea, and, the, yellow, sea, the, earliest, known, name, of, the, black, sea, is, the, sea, of, zalpa, so, called, by, both, the, hattians, and, their, conquerors, the, hittites, the, hattic, city, of, zalpa, was, situated, probably, at, or, near, the, estuary, of, the, marrassantiya, river, the, modern, k, z, l, irmak, on, the, black, sea, coast, the, principal, greek, name, p, ntos, xeinos, is, generally, accepted, to, be, a, rendering, of, the, iranian, word, ax, aina, dark, colored, ancient, greek, voyagers, adopted, the, name, as, xe, i, nos, identified, with, the, greek, word, xeinos, inhospitable, the, name, p, ntos, xeinos, inhospitable, sea, first, attested, in, pindar, c, 475, bc, was, considered, an, ill, omen, and, was, euphemized, to, its, opposite, e, xeinos, p, ntos, hospitable, sea, also, first, attested, in, pindar, this, became, the, commonly, used, designation, in, greek, although, in, mythological, contexts, the, true, name, p, ntos, xeinos, remained, favoured, strabo, s, geographica, 1, 2, 10, reports, that, in, antiquity, the, black, sea, was, often, simply, called, the, sea, ho, pontos, he, thought, that, the, sea, was, called, the, inhospitable, sea, p, ntos, xeinos, by, the, inhabitants, of, the, pontus, region, of, the, southern, shoreline, before, greek, colonisation, due, to, its, difficult, navigation, and, hostile, barbarian, natives, 7, 3, 6, and, that, the, name, was, changed, to, hospitable, after, the, milesians, colonised, the, region, bringing, it, into, the, greek, world, popular, supposition, derives, black, sea, from, the, dark, color, of, the, water, or, climatic, conditions, some, scholars, understand, the, name, to, be, derived, from, a, system, of, colour, symbolism, representing, the, cardinal, directions, with, black, or, dark, for, north, red, for, south, white, for, west, and, green, or, light, blue, for, east, hence, black, sea, meant, northern, sea, according, to, this, scheme, the, name, could, only, have, originated, with, a, people, living, between, the, northern, black, and, southern, red, seas, this, points, to, the, achaemenids, 550, 330, bc, in, the, greater, bundahishn, a, middle, persian, zoroastrian, scripture, the, black, sea, is, called, siy, bun, in, the, tenth, century, persian, geography, book, hudud, al, alam, the, black, sea, is, called, georgian, sea, dary, yi, gurz, the, georgian, chronicles, use, the, name, z, ua, sperisa, sea, of, speri, after, the, kartvelian, tribe, of, speris, or, saspers, other, modern, names, such, as, chyornoye, more, and, karadeniz, both, meaning, black, sea, originated, during, the, 13th, century, a, 1570, map, asiae, nova, descriptio, from, abraham, ortelius, s, theatrum, orbis,

ottoman, empire, it, was, called, either, bahr, e, siyah, perso, arabic, or, karadeniz, ottoman, turkish, both, meaning, black, sea, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, black, sea, as, follows, on, the, southwest, the, northeastern, limit, of, the, sea, of, marmara, in, the, kertch, strait, a, line, joining, cape, takil, and, cape, panaghia, 45, 02, n, the, area, surrounding, the, black, sea, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, black, sea, region, its, northern, part, lies, within, the, chernozem, belt, black, soil, belt, which, goes, from, eastern, croatia, slavonia, along, the, danube, northern, serbia, northern, bulgaria, danubian, plain, and, southern, romania, wallachian, plain, to, northeast, ukraine, and, further, across, the, central, black, earth, region, and, southern, russia, into, siberia, the, littoral, zone, of, the, black, sea, is, often, referred, to, as, the, pontic, littoral, or, pontic, zone, the, largest, bays, of, the, black, sea, are, karkinit, bay, in, ukraine, the, gulf, of, burgas, in, bulgaria, dnieprovski, bay, and, dniestrovski, bay, both, in, ukraine, and, sinop, bay, and, samsun, bay, both, in, turkey, the, largest, rivers, flowing, into, the, black, sea, are, these, rivers, and, their, tributaries, comprise, a, 2, million, km, 2, 0, 77, million, sq, mi, black, sea, drainage, basin, that, covers, wholly, or, partially, 24, countries, unrecognised, states, some, islands, in, the, black, sea, belong, to, bulgaria, romania, turkey, and, ukraine, short, term, climatic, variation, in, the, black, sea, region, is, significantly, influenced, by, the, operation, of, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, the, climatic, mechanisms, resulting, from, the, interaction, between, the, north, atlantic, and, mid, latitude, air, masses, while, the, exact, mechanisms, causing, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, remain, unclear, it, is, thought, the, climate, conditions, established, in, western, europe, mediate, the, heat, and, precipitation, fluxes, reaching, central, europe, and, eurasia, regulating, the, formation, of, winter, cyclones, which, are, largely, responsible, for, regional, precipitation, inputs, and, influence, mediterranean, sea, surface, temperatures, ssts, the, relative, strength, of, these, systems, also, limits, the, amount, of, cold, air, arriving, from, northern, regions, during, winter, other, influencing, factors, include, the, regional, topography, as, depressions, and, storm, systems, arriving, from, the, mediterranean, are, funneled, through, the, low, land, around, the, bosporus, with, the, pontic, and, caucasus, mountain, ranges, acting, as, waveguides, limiting, the, speed, and, paths, of, cyclones, passing, through, the, region, the, black, sea, is, divided, into, two, depositional, basins, the, western, black, sea, and, eastern, black, sea, separated, by, the, mid, black, sea, high, which, includes, the, andrusov, ridge, tetyaev, high, and, archangelsky, high, extending, south, from, the, crimean, peninsula, the, basin, includes, two, distinct, relict, back, arc, basins, which, were, initiated, by, the, splitting, of, an, albian, volcanic, arc, and, the, subduction, of, both, the, paleo, and, neo, tethys, oceans, but, the, timings, of, these, events, remain, uncertain, arc, volcanism, and, extension, occurred, as, the, neo, tethys, ocean, subducted, under, the, southern, margin, of, laurasia, during, the, mesozoic, uplift, and, compressional, deformation, took, place, as, the, neotethys, continued, to, close, seismic, surveys, indicate, that, rifting, began, in, the, western, black, sea, in, the, barremian, and, aptian, followed, by, the, formation, of, oceanic, crust, 20, million, years, later, in, the, santonian, since, its, initiation, compressional, tectonic, environments, led, to, subsidence, in, the, basin, interspersed, with, extensional, phases, resulting, in, large, scale, volcanism, and, numerous, orogenies, causing, the, uplift, of, the, greater, caucasus, pontides, southern, crimean, peninsula, and, balkanides, mountain, ranges, during, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, in, the, neighboring, mediterranean, sea, water, levels, fell, but, without, drying, up, the, sea, the, collision, between, the, eurasian, and, african, plates, and, the, westward, escape, of, the, anatolian, block, along, the, north, anatolian, and, east, anatolian, faults, dictates, the, current, tectonic, regime, which, features, enhanced, subsidence, in, the, black, sea, basin, and, significant, volcanic, activity, in, the, anatolian, region, these, geological, mechanisms, in, the, long, term, have, caused, the, periodic, isolations, of, the, black, sea, from, the, rest, of, the, global, ocean, system, the, large, shelf, to, the, north, of, the, basin, is, up, to, 190, km, 120, mi, wide, and, features, a, shallow, apron, with, gradients, between, 1, 40, and, 1, 1000, the, southern, edge, around, turkey, and, the, eastern, edge, around, georgia, however, are, typified, by, a, narrow, shelf, that, rarely, exceeds, 20, km, 12, mi, in, width, and, a, steep, apron, that, is, typically, 1, 40, gradient, with, numerous, submarine, canyons, and, channel, extensions, the, euxine, abyssal, plain, in, the, centre, of, the, black, sea, reaches, a, maximum, depth, of, 2, 212, metres, 7, 257, 22, feet, just, south, of, yalta, on, the, crimean, peninsula, the, paleo, euxinian, is, described, by, the, accumulation, of, eolian, silt, deposits, related, to, the, riss, glaciation, and, the, lowering, of, sea, levels, mis, 6, 8, and, 10, the, karangat, marine, transgression, occurred, during, the, eemian, interglacial, mis, 5e, this, may, have, been, the, highest, sea, levels, reached, in, the, late, pleistocene, based, on, this, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, crimean, peninsula, was, isolated, from, the, mainland, by, a, shallow, strait, during, the, eemian, interglacial, the, neoeuxinian, transgression, began, with, an, inflow, of, waters, from, the, caspian, sea, neoeuxinian, deposits, are, found, in, the, black, sea, below, 20, m, 66, ft, water, depth, in, three, layers, the, upper, layers, correspond, with, the, peak, of, the, khvalinian, transgression, on, the, shelf, shallow, water, sands, and, coquina, mixed, with, silty, sands, and, brackish, water, fauna, and, inside, the, black, sea, depression, hydrotroilite, silts, the, middle, layers, on, the, shelf, are, sands, with, brackish, water, mollusc, shells, of, continental, origin, the, lower, level, on, the, shelf, is, mostly, alluvial, sands, with, pebbles, mixed, with, less, common, lacustrine, silts, and, freshwater, mollusc, shells, inside, the, black, sea, depression, they, are, terrigenous, non, carbonate, silts, and, at, the, foot, of, the, continental, slope, turbidite, sediments, the, black, sea, is, the, world, s, largest, body, of, water, with, a, meromictic, basin, the, deep, waters, do, not, mix, with, the, upper, layers, of, water, that, receive, oxygen, from, the, atmosphere, as, a, result, over, 90, of, the, deeper, black, sea, volume, is, anoxic, water, the, black, sea, s, circulation, patterns, are, primarily, controlled, by, basin, topography, and, fluvial, inputs, which, result, in, a, strongly, stratified, vertical, structure, because, of, the, extreme, stratification, it, is, classified, as, a, salt, wedge, estuary, inflow, from, the, mediterranean, sea, through, the, bosporus, and, dardanelles, has, a, higher, salinity, and, density, than, the, outflow, creating, the, classic, estuarine, circulation, this, means, that, the, inflow, of, dense, water, from, the, mediterranean, occurs, at, the, bottom, of, the, basin, while, the, outflow, of, fresher, black, sea, surface, water, into, the, sea, of, marmara, occurs, near, the, surface, according, to, gregg, 2002, the, outflow, is, 16, 000, cubic, metres, per, second, 570, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, or, around, 500, cubic, kilometres, per, year, 120, cubic, miles, per, year, and, the, inflow, is, 11, 000, m, 3, s, 390, 000, cu, ft, s, or, around, 350, km, 3, a, 84, cu, mi, a, the, following, water, budget, can, be, estimated, the, southern, sill, of, the, bosporus, is, located, at, 36, 5, m, 120, ft, below, present, sea, level, deepest, spot, of, the, shallowest, cross, section, in, the, bosporus, located, in, front, of, dolmabah, e, palace, and, has, a, wet, section, of, around, 38, 000, m, 2, 410, 000, sq, ft, inflow, and, outflow, current, speeds, are, averaged, around, 0, 3, to, 0, 4, m, s, 1, 0, to, 1, 3, ft, s, but, much, higher, speeds, are, found, locally, inducing, significant, turbulence, and, vertical, shear, this, allows, for, turbulent, mixing, of, the, two, layers, surface, water, leaves, the, black, sea, with, a, salinity, of, 17, practical, salinity, units, psu, and, reaches, the, mediterranean, with, a, salinity, of, 34, psu, likewise, an, inflow, of, the, mediterranean, with, salinity, 38, 5, psu, experiences, a, decrease, to, about, 34, psu, mean, surface, circulation, is, cyclonic, waters, around, the, perimeter, of, the, black, sea, circulate, in, a, basin, wide, shelfbreak, gyre, known, as, the, rim, current, the, rim, current, has, a, maximum, velocity, of, about, 50, 100, cm, s, 20, 39, in, s, within, this, feature, two, smaller, cyclonic, gyres, operate, occupying, the, eastern, and, western, sectors, of, the, basin, the, eastern, and, western, gyres, are, well, organized, systems, in, the, winter, but, dissipate, into, a, series, of, interconnected, eddies, in, the, summer, and, autumn, mesoscale, activity, in, the, peripheral, flow, becomes, more, pronounced, during, these, warmer, seasons, and, is, subject, to, interannual, variability, outside, of, the, rim, current, numerous, quasi, permanent, coastal, eddies, are, formed, as, a, result, of, upwelling, around, the, coastal, apron, and, wind, curl, mechanisms, the, intra, annual, strength, of, these, features, is, controlled, by, seasonal, atmospheric, and, fluvial, variations, during, the, spring, the, batumi, eddy, forms, in, the, southeastern, corner, of, the, sea, beneath, the, surface, waters, from, about, 50, to, 100, metres, 160, to, 330, ft, there, exists, a, halocline, that, stops, at, the, cold, intermediate, layer, cil, this, layer, is, composed, of, cool, salty, surface, waters, which, are, the, result, of, localized, atmospheric, cooling, and, decreased, fluvial, input, during, the, winter, months, it, is, the, remnant, of, the, winter, surface, mixed, layer, the, base, of, the, cil, is, marked, by, a, major, pycnocline, at, about, 100, 200, metres, 330, 660, ft, and, this, density, disparity, is, the, major, mechanism, for, isolation, of, the, deep, water, below, the, pycnocline, is, the, deep, water, mass, where, salinity, increases, to, 22, 3, psu, and, temperatures, rise, to, around, 8, 9, c, 48, 0, f, the, hydrochemical, environment, shifts, from, oxygenated, to, anoxic, as, bacterial, decomposition, of, sunken, biomass, utilizes, all, of, the, free, oxygen, weak, geothermal, heating, and, long, residence, time, create, a, very, thick, convective, bottom, layer, the, black, sea, undersea, river, is, a, current, of, particularly, saline, water, flowing, through, the, bosporus, strait, and, along, the, seabed, of, the, black, sea, the, discovery, of, the, river, announced, on, august, 1, 2010, was, made, by, scientists, at, the, university, of, leeds, and, is, the, first, of, its, kind, to, be, identified, the, undersea, river, stems, from, salty, water, spilling, through, the, bosporus, strait, from, the, mediterranean, sea, into, the, black, sea, where, the, water, has, a, lower, salt, content, because, of, the, anoxic, water, at, depth, organic, matter, including, anthropogenic, artifacts, such, as, boat, hulls, are, well, preserved, during, periods, of, high, surface, productivity, short, lived, algal, blooms, form, organic, rich, layers, known, as, sapropels, scientists, have, reported, an, annual, phytoplankton, bloom, that, can, be, seen, in, many, nasa, images, of, the, region, as, a, result, of, these, characteristics, the, black, sea, has, gained, interest, from, the, field, of, marine, archaeology, as, ancient, shipwrecks, in, excellent, states, of, preservation, have, been, discovered, such, as, the, byzantine, wreck, sinop, d, located, in, the, anoxic, layer, off, the, coast, of, sinop, turkey, modelling, shows, that, in, the, event, of, an, asteroid, impact, on, the, black, sea, the, release, of, hydrogen, sulfide, clouds, would, pose, a, threat, to, health, and, perhaps, even, life, for, people, living, on, the, black, sea, coast, there, have, been, isolated, reports, of, flares, on, the, black, sea, occurring, during, thunderstorms, possibly, caused, by, lightning, igniting, combustible, gas, seeping, up, from, the, sea, depths, the, black, sea, supports, an, active, and, dynamic, marine, ecosystem, dominated, by, species, suited, to, the, brackish, nutrient, rich, conditions, as, with, all, marine, food, webs, the, black, sea, features, a, range, of, trophic, groups, with, autotrophic, algae, including, diatoms, and, dinoflagellates, acting, as, primary, producers, the, fluvial, systems, draining, eurasia, and, central, europe, introduce, large, volumes, of, sediment, and, dissolved, nutrients, into, the, black, sea, but, the, distribution, of, these, nutrients, is, controlled, by, the, degree, of, physiochemical, stratification, which, is, in, turn, dictated, by, seasonal, physiographic, development, during, winter, strong, wind, promotes, convective, overturning, and, upwelling, of, nutrients, while, high, summer, temperatures, result, in, a, marked, vertical, stratification, and, a, warm, shallow, mixed, layer, day, length, and, insolation, intensity, also, control, the, extent, of, the, photic, zone, subsurface, productivity, is, limited, by, nutrient, availability, as, the, anoxic, bottom, waters, act, as, a, sink, for, reduced, nitrate, in, the, form, of, ammonia, the, benthic, zone, also, plays, an, important, role, in, black, sea, nutrient, cycling, as, chemosynthetic, organisms, and, anoxic, geochemical, pathways, recycle, nutrients, which, can, be, upwelled, to, the, photic, zone, enhancing, productivity, in, total, the, black, sea, s, biodiversity, contains, around, one, third, of, the, mediterranean, s, and, is, experiencing, natural, and, artificial, invasions, or, mediterranizations, the, main, phytoplankton, groups, present, in, the, black, sea, are, dinoflagellates, diatoms, coccolithophores, and, cyanobacteria, generally, the, annual, cycle, of, phytoplankton, development, comprises, significant, diatom, and, dinoflagellate, dominated, spring, production, followed, by, a, weaker, mixed, assemblage, of, community, development, below, the, seasonal, thermocline, during, summer, months, and, surface, intensified, autumn, production, this, pattern, of, productivity, is, augmented, by, an, emiliania, huxleyi, bloom, during, the, late, spring, and, summer, months, since, the, 1960s, rapid, industrial, expansion, along, the, black, sea, coastline, and, the, construction, of, a, major, dam, has, significantly, increased, annual, variability, in, the, n, p, si, ratio, in, the, basin, in, coastal, areas, the, biological, effect, of, these, changes, has, been, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, monospecific, phytoplankton, blooms, with, diatom, bloom, frequency, increasing, by, a, factor, of, 2, 5, and, non, diatom, bloom, frequency, increasing, by, a, factor, of, 6, the, non, diatoms, such, as, the, prymnesiophytes, emiliania, huxleyi, coccolithophore, chromulina, sp, and, the, euglenophyte, eutreptia, lanowii, are, able, to, out, compete, diatom, species, because, of, the, limited, availability, of, silicon, a, necessary, constituent, of, diatom, frustules, as, a, consequence, of, these, blooms, benthic, macrophyte, populations, were, deprived, of, light, while, anoxia, caused, mass, mortality, in, marine, animals, the, decline, in, macrophytes, was, further, compounded, by, overfishing, during, the, 1970s, while, the, invasive, ctenophore, mnemiopsis, reduced, the, biomass, of, copepods, and, other, zooplankton, in, the, late, 1980s, additionally, an, alien, species, the, warty, comb, jelly, mnemiopsis, leidyi, was, able, to, establish, itself, in, the, basin, exploding, from, a, few, individuals, to, an, estimated, biomass, of, one, billion, metric, tons, the, change, in, species, composition, in, black, sea, waters, also, has, consequences, for, hydrochemistry, as, calcium, producing, coccolithophores, influence, salinity, and, ph, although, these, ramifications, have, yet, to, be, fully, quantified, in, central, black, sea, waters, silicon, levels, were, also, significantly, reduced, due, to, a, decrease, in, the, flux, of, silicon, associated, with, advection, across, isopycnal, surfaces, this, phenomenon, demonstrates, the, potential, for, localized, alterations, in, black, sea, nutrient, input, to, have, basin, wide, effects, pollution, reduction, and, regulation, efforts, have, led, to, a, partial, recovery, of, the, black, sea, ecosystem, during, the, 1990s, and, an, eu, monitoring, exercise, eros21, revealed, decreased, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, values, relative, to, the, 1989, peak, recently, scientists, have, noted, signs, of, ecological, recovery, in, part, due, to, the, construction, of, new, sewage, treatment, plants, in, slovakia, hungary, romania, and, bulgaria, in, connection, with, membership, in, the, european, union, mnemiopsis, leidyi, populations, have, been, checked, with, the, arrival, of, another, alien, species, which, feeds, on, them, the, black, sea, is, connected, to, the, world, ocean, by, a, chain, of, two, shallow, straits, the, dardanelles, and, the, bosporus, the, dardanelles, is, 55, m, 180, ft, deep, and, the, bosporus, is, as, shallow, as, 36, m, 118, ft, by, comparison, at, the, height, of, the, last, ice, age, sea, levels, were, more, than, 100, m, 330, ft, lower, than, they, are, now, there, is, evidence, that, water, levels, in, the, black, sea, were, considerably, lower, at, some, point, during, the, post, glacial, period, some, researchers, theorize, that, the, black, sea, had, been, a, landlocked, freshwater, lake, at, least, in, upper, layers, during, the, last, glaciation, and, for, some, time, after, in, the, aftermath, of, the, last, glacial, period, water, levels, in, the, black, sea, and, the, aegean, sea, rose, independently, until, they, were, high, enough, to, exchange, water, the, exact, timeline, of, this, development, is, still, subject, to, debate, one, possibility, is, that, the, black, sea, filled, first, with, excess, freshwater, flowing, over, the, bosporus, sill, and, eventually, into, the, mediterranean, sea, there, are, also, catastrophic, scenarios, such, as, the, black, sea, deluge, hypothesis, put, forward, by, william, ryan, walter, pitman, and, petko, dimitrov, the, black, sea, deluge, is, a, hypothesized, catastrophic, rise, in, the, level, of, the, black, sea, c, 5600, bc, due, to, waters, from, the, mediterranean, sea, breaching, a, sill, in, the, bosporus, strait, the, hypothesis, was, headlined, when, the, new, york, times, published, it, in, december, 1996, shortly, before, it, was, published, in, an, academic, journal, while, it, is, agreed, that, the, sequence, of, events, described, did, occur, there, is, debate, over, the, suddenness, dating, and, magnitude, of, the, events, relevant, to, the, hypothesis, is, that, its, description, has, led, some, to, connect, this, catastrophe, with, prehistoric, flood, myths, the, black, sea, was, sailed, by, hittites, carians, colchians, armenians, thracians, greeks, persians, cimmerians, scythians, romans, byzantines, goths, huns, avars, slavs, varangians, crusaders, venetians, genoese, georgians, bulgarians, tatars, and, ottomans, the, concentration, of, historical, powers, combined, with, the, preservative, qualities, of, the, deep, anoxic, waters, of, the, black, sea, has, attracted, increased, interest, from, marine, archaeologists, who, have, begun, to, discover, a, large, number, of, ancient, ships, and, organic, remains, in, a, high, state, of, preservation, the, black, sea, was, a, busy, waterway, on, the, crossroads, of, the, ancient, world, the, balkans, to, the, west, the, eurasian, steppes, to, the, north, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, to, the, east, asia, minor, and, mesopotamia, to, the,

the, pontic, caspian, steppe, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, is, seen, by, several, researchers, as, the, pre, historic, original, homeland, urheimat, of, the, speakers, of, the, proto, indo, european, language, pie, greek, presence, in, the, black, sea, began, at, least, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, bc, with, colonies, scattered, along, the, black, sea, s, southern, coast, attracting, traders, and, colonists, due, to, the, grain, grown, in, the, black, sea, hinterland, by, 500, bc, permanent, greek, communities, existed, all, around, the, black, sea, and, a, lucrative, trade, network, connected, the, entirety, of, the, black, sea, to, the, wider, mediterranean, while, greek, colonies, generally, maintained, very, close, cultural, ties, to, their, founding, polis, greek, colonies, in, the, black, sea, began, to, develop, their, own, black, sea, greek, culture, known, today, as, pontic, the, coastal, communities, of, black, sea, greeks, remained, a, prominent, part, of, the, greek, world, for, centuries, and, the, realms, of, mithridates, of, pontus, rome, and, constantinople, spanned, the, black, sea, to, include, crimean, territories, the, black, sea, became, a, virtual, ottoman, navy, lake, within, five, years, of, the, republic, of, genoa, losing, control, of, the, crimean, peninsula, in, 1479, after, which, the, only, western, merchant, vessels, to, sail, its, waters, were, those, of, venice, s, old, rival, ragusa, the, black, sea, became, a, trade, route, of, slaves, between, crimea, and, ottoman, anatolia, via, the, crimean, nogai, slave, raids, in, eastern, europe, imperial, russia, became, a, significant, black, sea, power, in, the, late, 18th, century, occupying, the, littoral, of, novorossiya, in, 1764, and, of, crimea, in, 1783, ottoman, restrictions, on, black, sea, navigation, were, challenged, by, the, black, sea, fleet, founded, in, 1783, of, the, imperial, russian, navy, and, the, ottomans, relaxed, export, controls, after, the, outbreak, in, 1789, of, the, french, revolution, the, crimean, war, fought, between, 1853, and, 1856, saw, naval, engagements, between, the, french, and, british, allies, and, the, forces,

unfavourable, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, 1856, which, included, the, loss, of, a, naval, fleet, on, the, black, sea, and, the, provision, that, the, black, sea, was, to, be, a, demilitarized, zone, similar, to, a, contemporaneous, region, of, the, baltic, sea, the, black, sea, was, a, significant, naval, theatre, of, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, and, saw, both, naval, and, land, battles, between, 1941, and, 1945, during, world, war, ii, for, example, sevastopol, was, obliterated, by, the, nazis, who, even, brought, schwerer, gustav, to, the, siege, of, sevastopol, 1941, 1942, the,

between, november, and, december, in, the, 1980s, the, soviet, union, started, offshore, drilling, for, petroleum, in, the, sea, s, western, portion, adjoining, ukraine, s, coast, independent, ukraine, continued, and, intensified, that, effort, within, its, exclusive, economic, zone, inviting, major, international, oil, companies, for, exploration, discovery, of, the, new, massive, oilfields, in, the, area, stimulated, an, influx, of, foreign, investments, it, also, provoked, a, short, term, peaceful, territorial, dispute, with, romania, which, was, resolved, in, 2011, by, an, international, court, redefining, the, exclusive, economic, zones, between, the, two, countries, the, black, sea, contains, oil, and, natural, gas, resources, but, exploration, in, the, sea, is, incomplete, as, of, 2017, 20, wells, are, in, place, throughout, much, of, its, existence, the, black, sea, has, had, significant, oil, and, gas, forming, potential, because, of, significant, inflows, of, sediment, and, nutrient, rich, waters, however, this, varies, geographically, for, example, prospects, are, poorer, off, the, coast, of, bulgaria, because, of, the, large, influx, of, sediment, from, the, danube, which, obscured, sunlight, and, diluted, organic, rich, sediments, many, of, the, discoveries, to, date, have, taken, place, offshore, of, romania, in, the, western, black, sea, and, only, a, few, discoveries, have, been, made, in, the, eastern, black, sea, during, the, eocene, the, paratethys, sea, was, partially, isolated, and, sea, levels, fell, during, this, time, sand,

1999, with, two, deep, water, wells, limank, y, 1, and, limank, y, 2, drilled, in, turkish, waters, next, the, hpx, hopa, 1, deepwater, well, targeted, late, miocene, sandstone, units, in, achara, trialet, fold, belt, also, known, as, the, gurian, fold, belt, along, the, georgia, turkey, maritime, border, although, geologists, inferred, that, these, rocks, might, have, hydrocarbons, that, migrated, from, the, maykop, suite, the, well, was, unsuccessful, no, more, drilling, happened, for, five, years, after, the, hpx, 1, well, in, 2010, sinop, 1, targeted, carbonate, reservoirs, potentially, charged, from, the, nearby, maykop, suite, on, the, andrusov, ridge, but, the, well, struck, only, cretaceous, volcanic, rocks, yassih, y, k, 1, encountered, similar, problems, other, turkish, wells, s, rmene, 1, and, sile, 1, drilled, in, the, eastern, black, sea, in, 2011, and, 2015, respectively, tested, four, way, closures, above, cretaceous, volcanoes, with, no, results, in, either, case, a, different, turkish, well, kastamonu, 1, drilled, in, 2011, did, successfully, find, thermogenic, gas, in, pliocene, and, miocene, shale, cored, anticlines, in, the, western, black, sea, a, year, later, in, 2012, romania, drilled, domino, 1, which, struck, gas, prompting, the, drilling, of, other, wells, in, the, neptun, deep, in, 2016, the, bulgarian, well, polshkov, 1,

found, 320, billion, cubic, metres, 11, trillion, cubic, feet, of, natural, gas, in, the, biggest, ever, discovery, in, the, black, sea, and, hoped, to, begin, production, in, the, sakarya, gas, field, by, 2023, the, sector, is, near, where, romania, has, also, found, gas, reserves, in, the, years, following, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, popularity, of, the, black, sea, as, a, tourist,
