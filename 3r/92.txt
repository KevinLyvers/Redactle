haplochromines, in, lake, albert, four, are, endemic, haplochromis, albertianus, h, avium, h, bullatus, and, h, mahagiensis, and, two, are, also, found, in, the, nile, h, loati, and, pseudocrenilabrus, multicolor, in, comparison, most, of, the, more, than, 60, haplochromines, in, lake, edward, george, and, most, of, the, roughly, 600, haplochromines, in, lake, victoria, kyoga, are, endemic, the, only, other, endemic, fish, species, in, lake, albert, are, the, small, cyprinid, engraulicypris, bredoi, and, the, endangered, albert, lates, lake, albert, is, still, known, as,
