the, same, distribution, of, elements, as, found, naturally, on, very, deep, seabeds, but, the, geochemical, evidence, suggests, that, the, origin, of, these, elements, is, extreme, weathering, of,

contributes, no, adverse, health, effects, from, the, radioactivity, or, the, other, trace, elements, have, been, demonstrated, and, calculations, show, that, the, level, of, radioactivity, is, probably, much, too, low, to, be, detected, in, the, population, these, unusual, soils, are, very, rich, in, phosphate, but, it, is, not, accessible, to, plants, being, in, the, very, insoluble, form,
