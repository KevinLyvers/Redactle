the, legend, that, are, most, often, cited, the, first, states, that, 16th, century, nuns, from, the, convent, of, santa, rosa, were, worried, because, they, had, just, found, out, that, the, archbishop, was, going, to, visit, them, and, they, had, nothing, to, prepare, for, him, except, for, an, old, turkey, in, the, yard, supposedly, due, to, divine, inspiration, they, began, to, mix, together, many, of, the, spices, and, flavorings, they, had, on, hand, in, the, kitchen, including, different, types, of, chili, peppers, other, spices, day, old, bread, chocolate, and, approximately, twenty, other, ingredients, they, let, the, sauce, simmer, for, hours, and, poured, it, over, the, turkey, meat, fortunately, the, archbishop, was, very, pleased, with, the, meal, and, the, nuns, were, able, to, save, face, the, other, story, states, that, the, sauce, is, of, pre, hispanic, times, and, this, was, served, to, hern, n, cort, s, and, the, other, conquistadors, by, moctezuma, ii, the, aztecs, did, have, a, preparation, called, chilmulli, which, in, nahuatl, means, chili, pepper, sauce, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, chocolate, was, ever, used, to, flavor, prepared, foods, or, used, in, chilmulli, what, has, happened, is, that, the, sauce, gained, ingredients, as, it, was, reinterpreted, over, the, colonial, period, many, food, writers, and, gourmets, nowadays, consider, one, particular, dish, the, famous, turkey, in, mole, poblano, which, contains, chocolate, to, represent, the, pinnacle, of, the, mexican, cooking, tradition, another, famous, dish, chiles, en, nogada, was, also, supposedly, invented, here, the, story, begins, with, three, sisters, from, puebla, who, met, officers, from, agustin, de, iturbide, s, army, of, the, three, guarantees, in, mexico, city, and, fell, in, love, with, them, attempts, were, made, to, engage, the, couples, but, one, problem, was, that, none, of, the, sisters, knew, how, to, cook, upon, returning, to, puebla, their, mother, sent, them, to, the, convent, of, santa, monica, to, learn, the, women, decided, they, wanted, to, make, an, original, dish, to, impress, iturbide, and, his, officers, when, they, were, due, to, visit, puebla, the, dish, chiles, en, nogada, represents, the, colors, of, the, mexican, flag, green, parsley, white, the, walnut, sauce, and, red, pomegranate, seeds, the, dish, was, served, for, the, first, time, at, a, banquet, for, iturbide, with, great, success, another, signature, dish, in, puebla, is, the, cemita, which, is, a, type, of, well, stuffed, sandwich, on, a, bun, the, cemita, is, considered, to, be, the, sister, of, the, mexican, torta, the, first, cousin, of, the, pambazo, the, distant, cousin, of, the, paste, and, the, sandwich, and, the, precursor, to, the, giant, tortas, that, are, now, sold, in, most, parts, of, mexico, today, this, large, meaty, sandwich, is, named, after, the, bread, on, which, it, is, served, a, cemita, this, bread, is, based, on, a, bread, introduced, by, the, french, during, the, period, of, the, french, intervention, in, mexico, 1863, 1867, but, since, then, has, evolved, to, suit, mexican, tastes, especially, in, puebla, state, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, bread, began, to, be, served, sliced, with, a, filling, of, leftovers, generally, potatoes, beans, nopal, beef, chicken, or, pork, the, victoria, market, in, puebla, became, famous, for, a, version, with, beef, hoof, onions, and, chili, peppers, with, a, vinaigrette, sauce, other, markets, and, food, stands, soon, created, their, own, versions, of, the, cemita, with, just, about, any, kind, of, filling, combination, possible, during, the, same, time, period, it, became, traditional, to, sprinkle, sesame, seeds, onto, the, cemita, bread, often, with, designs, of, flowers, stars, animals, and, other, things, while, the, dish, started, out, as, a, lower, class, meal, it, is, now, enjoyed, by, people, of, all, social, classes, in, the, city, as, a, form, of, fast, food, soon, after, its, foundation, puebla, was, well, known, for, its, fine, ceramics, especially, for, the, style, that, would, be, called, talavera, this, has, been, due, to, the, abundance, of, quality, clay, in, the, region, drawing, some, of, the, best, artisans, between, 1550, and, 1570, spanish, potters, from, talavera, de, la, reina, in, spain, came, to, puebla, to, teach, the, locals, european, techniques, of, using, the, potter, s, wheel, and, tin, glazing, these, new, methods, were, mixed, with, native, designs, to, give, rise, to, what, became, known, as, poblano, talavera, the, glazing, technique, was, first, used, for, the, tiles, that, still, decorate, many, of, the, buildings, in, this, city, later, it, was, used, to, make, pots, plates, jars, religious, figures, and, other, items, by, the, mid, 17th, century, the, industry, here, had, become, well, established, guilds, were, formed, and, ordinances, passed, to, ensure, quality, blue, was, used, only, on, the, most, expensive, pieces, due, to, the, cost, of, the, mineral, used, to, produce, it, the, period, between, 1650, and, 1750, was, known, as, the, golden, age, in, 1813, the, constitution, eradicated, the, potter, s, guild, and, revoked, the, ordinances, established, in, 1653, to, standardize, production, now, anybody, could, use, this, ceramic, method, in, any, style, they, wanted, and, the, lack, of, regulations, led, to, a, decline, in, technique, and, artistic, quality, the, talavera, market, crashed, out, of, the, 46, workshops, in, production, since, the, 18th, century, only, seven, remained, when, enrique, luis, ventosa, a, 29, year, old, catalan, arrived, in, puebla, in, 1897, there, were, just, six, workshops, left, ventosa, was, fascinated, by, the, history, and, fine, craft, work, that, had, distinguished, puebla, from, the, rest, of, mexico, he, became, the, leading, force, behind, a, renaissance, in, talavera, ware, another, impetus, to, the, rebirth, of, puebla, tile, was, that, collectors, found, out, about, it, in, 1904, an, american, named, emily, johnston, de, forest, traveled, to, mexico, with, her, husband, and, discovered, talavera, she, established, contact, with, scholars, collectors, and, dealers, who, assisted, her, in, building, her, collection, eventually, her, collection, was, given, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, other, museums, like, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, built, their, own, collections, the, franz, mayer, museum, in, mexico, city, has, the, largest, collection, of, 726, pieces, according, to, colonial, era, published, sources, a, young, indian, woman, named, mirra, was, kidnapped, by, portuguese, pirates, and, taken, to, cochin, modern, day, kochi, in, the, south, of, india, there, she, escaped, her, kidnappers, and, took, refuge, in, a, jesuit, mission, where, she, was, baptized, with, the, name, catarina, de, san, juan, mirra, was, again, kidnapped, by, the, same, pirates, that, had, taken, her, from, her, birth, parents, and, in, manila, they, delivered, her, to, the, merchant, who, later, took, her, to, new, spain, once, in, acapulco, she, was, sold, to, a, puebla, merchant, by, the, name, of, miguel, de, sosa, through, her, life, catarina, or, mirra, continued, to, dress, in, a, sari, it, is, possible, that, this, gave, rise, to, the, china, dress, that, became, popular, in, mexico, in, the, 17th, century, a, few, years, after, her, arrival, in, mexico, miguel, de, sosa, died, providing, in, his, will, for, the, manumission, of, his, slave, she, was, taken, in, by, a, convent, where, it, is, said, she, began, to, have, visions, of, the, virgin, mary, and, baby, jesus, the, china, poblana, died, on, 5, january, 1688, at, the, age, of, 82, in, puebla, she, was, venerated, as, a, saint, until, 1691, when, the, mexican, inquisition, prohibited, open, devotion, to, her, today, the, templo, de, la, compa, a, in, puebla, is, known, as, la, tumba, de, la, china, poblana, because, in, its, sacristy, lie, the, remains, of, catarina, de, san, juan, there, have, long, been, rumours, of, a, system, of,
