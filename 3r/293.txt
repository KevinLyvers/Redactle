after, enlisting, french, military, help, in, suppressing, the, corsican, revolt, as, a, result, france, annexed, the, island, in, 1769, the, future, emperor, of, the, french, napoleon, bonaparte, was, a, native, corsican, born, that, same, year, in, ajaccio, his, ancestral, home, maison, bonaparte, is, now, a, visitor, attraction, and, museum, because, of, corsica, s, historical, ties, to, tuscany, the, island, has, retained, many, italian, cultural, elements, and, many, corsican, surnames, are, rooted, in, the, italian, peninsula, french, fran, ais, is, the, official, and, most, widely, spoken, language, on, the, island, with, corsican, the, native, language, and, an, italo, dalmatian, language, also, recognized, as, one, of, france, s, regional, languages, corsica, is, the, third, least, populated, region, of, france, after, mayotte, and, french, guiana, corsica, has, been, occupied, since, the, mesolithic, era, the, permanent, human, presence, in, corsica, is, documented, in, the, neolithic, period, from, the, 6th, millennium, bc, after, a, brief, occupation, by, the, carthaginians, colonization, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, an, only, slightly, longer, occupation, by, the, etruscans, it, was, incorporated, by, the, roman, republic, at, the, end, of, the, first, punic, war, and, with, sardinia, in, 238, bc, became, a, province, of, the, roman, republic, the, romans, who, built, a, colony, in, al, ria, considered, corsica, as, one, of, the, most, backward, regions, of, the, roman, world, the, island, produced, sheep, honey, resin, and, wax, and, exported, many, slaves, not, well, considered, because, of, their, fierce, and, rebellious, character, moreover, it, was, known, for, its, cheap, wines, exported, to, rome, and, was, used, as, a, place, of, exile, one, of, the, most, famous, being, the, roman, philosopher, seneca, corsica, was, integrated, into, roman, italy, by, emperor, diocletian, r, 284, 305, administratively, the, island, was, divided, into, pagi, which, in, the, middle, ages, became, the, pievi, the, basic, administrative, units, of, the, island, until, 1768, in, the, fifth, century, the, western, half, of, the, roman, empire, collapsed, and, the, island, was, invaded, by, the, vandals, and, the, ostrogoths, briefly, recovered, by, the, byzantine, empire, it, soon, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, lombards, this, made, it, a, dependency, of, the, march, of, tuscany, which, used, it, as, an, outpost, against, the, saracens, pepin, the, short, king, of, the, franks, and, charlemagne, s, father, expelled, the, lombards, and, nominally, granted, corsica, to, pope, stephen, ii, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 11th, century, pisa, and, genoa, together, freed, the, island, from, the, threat, of, arab, invasion, after, that, the, island, came, under, the, influence, of, the, republic, of, pisa, many, polychrome, churches, which, adorn, the, island, date, from, this, period, corsica, also, experienced, a, massive, immigration, from, tuscany, which, gave, to, the, island, its, present, toponymy, and, rendered, the, language, spoken, in, the, northern, two, thirds, of, the, island, very, close, to, the, tuscan, dialect, this, led, to, the, traditional, division, of, corsica, into, two, parts, along, the, main, chain, of, mountains, roughly, going, from, calvi, to, porto, vecchio, the, eastern, banda, di, dentro, or, cismonte, more, populated, developed, and, open, to, the, commerce, with, italy, and, the, western, banda, di, fuori, or, pomonte, almost, deserted, wild, and, remote, the, crushing, defeat, experienced, by, pisa, in, 1284, in, the, battle, of, meloria, against, genoa, had, among, its, consequences, the, end, of, the, pisan, rule, and, the, beginning, of, the, genoese, influence, in, corsica, this, was, contested, initially, by, the, king, of, aragon, who, in, 1296, had, received, from, the, pope, the, investiture, over, sardinia, and, corsica, a, popular, revolution, against, this, and, the, feudal, lords, led, by, sambucuccio, d, alando, got, the, aid, of, genoa, after, that, the, cismonte, was, ruled, as, a, league, of, comuni, and, churches, after, the, italian, experience, the, following, 150, years, were, a, period, of, conflict, when, the, genoese, rule, was, contested, by, aragon, the, local, lords, the, comuni, and, the, pope, finally, in, 1450, genoa, ceded, the, administration, of, the, island, to, its, main, bank, the, bank, of, saint, george, which, brought, peace, in, the, 16th, century, the, island, entered, into, the, fight, between, spain, and, france, for, supremacy, in, italy, in, 1553, a, franco, ottoman, fleet, occupied, corsica, but, the, reaction, of, spain, and, genoa, led, by, andrea, doria, reestablished, the, genoese, supremacy, on, the, island, confirmed, by, the, peace, of, cateau, cambr, sis, the, unlucky, protagonist, of, this, episode, was, sampiero, di, bastelica, who, would, later, come, to, be, considered, a, hero, of, the, island, their, power, reinstated, the, genoese, did, not, allow, the, corsican, nobility, to, share, in, the, government, of, the, island, and, oppressed, the, inhabitants, with, a, heavy, tax, burden, on, the, other, hand, they, introduced, the, chestnut, tree, on, a, large, scale, improving, the, diet, of, the, population, and, built, a, chain, of, towers, along, the, coast, to, defend, corsica, from, the, attacks, of, the, barbary, pirates, from, north, africa, the, period, of, peace, lasted, until, 1729, when, the, refusal, to, pay, taxes, by, a, peasant, sparked, the, general, insurrection, of, the, island, against, genoa, the, island, became, known, for, the, large, number, of, mercenary, soldiers, and, officers, it, produced, in, 1743, over, 4, 600, corsicans, or, 4, of, the, entire, population, of, the, island, were, serving, as, soldiers, in, various, armies, predominantly, those, of, genoa, venice, and, spain, making, it, one, of, the, most, militarized, societies, in, europe, in, 1729, the, corsican, revolution, for, independence, from, genoa, began, first, led, by, luiggi, giafferi, and, giacinto, paoli, and, later, by, paoli, s, son, pasquale, paoli, after, 26, years, of, struggle, against, the, republic, of, genoa, including, an, ephemeral, attempt, in, 1736, to, proclaim, an, independent, kingdom, of, corsica, under, the, german, adventurer, theodor, von, neuhoff, an, independent, corsican, republic, was, proclaimed, in, 1755, under, the, leadership, of, pasquale, paoli, and, remained, sovereign, until, 1769, when, the, island, was, conquered, by, france, following, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, pasquale, paoli, was, able, to, return, to, corsica, from, exile, in, britain, in, 1794, he, invited, british, forces, under, lord, hood, to, intervene, to, free, corsica, from, french, rule, anglo, corsican, forces, drove, the, french, from, the, island, and, established, an, anglo, corsican, kingdom, following, spain, s, entry, into, the, war, the, british, decided, to, withdraw, from, corsica, in, 1796, despite, being, the, birthplace, of, the, emperor, the, island, was, slightly, neglected, by, napoleon, s, government, in, 1814, near, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, corsica, was, briefly, occupied, again, by, british, troops, the, treaty, of, bastia, gave, the, british, crown, sovereignty, over, the, island, but, it, was, later, repudiated, by, lord, castlereagh, who, insisted, that, the, island, should, be, returned, to, a, restored, french, monarchy, after, the, restoration, the, island, was, further, neglected, by, the, french, state, despite, the, presence, of, a, middle, class, in, bastia, and, ajaccio, corsica, remained, an, otherwise, primitive, place, whose, economy, consisted, mainly, of, subsistence, agriculture, and, whose, population, constituted, a, pastoral, society, dominated, by, clans, and, the, rules, of, vendetta, the, code, of, vendetta, required, corsicans, to, seek, deadly, revenge, for, offences, against, their, family, s, honor, between, 1821, and, 1852, no, fewer, than, 4, 300, murders, were, perpetrated, in, corsica, during, the, first, half, of, the, century, the, people, of, corsica, were, still, immersed, in, the, italian, cultural, world, the, bourgeoisie, sent, children, to, pisa, to, study, official, acts, were, enacted, in, italian, and, most, books, were, printed, in, italian, moreover, many, islanders, sympathised, with, the, national, struggle, which, was, taking, place, in, nearby, italy, in, those, years, several, political, refugees, from, the, peninsula, like, niccol, tommaseo, spent, years, on, the, island, while, some, corsicans, like, count, leonetto, cipriani, took, active, part, in, the, fights, for, italian, independence, despite, all, that, during, those, years, the, corsicans, began, to, feel, an, increasingly, strong, attachment, to, france, the, reasons, for, that, are, manifold, the, knowledge, of, the, french, language, which, thanks, to, the, mandatory, primary, school, started, to, penetrate, among, the, local, youth, the, high, prestige, of, french, culture, the, awareness, of, being, part, of, a, big, powerful, state, the, possibility, of, well, paid, jobs, as, civil, servants, both, in, the, island, in, the, mainland, and, in, the, colonies, the, prospect, of, serving, the, french, army, during, the, wars, for, the, conquest, of, the, colonial, empire, the, introduction, of, steamboats, which, reduced, the, travel, time, between, mainland, france, and, the, island, drastically, and, last, but, not, least, napoleon, himself, whose, existence, alone, constituted, an, indissoluble, link, between, france, and, corsica, thanks, to, all, these, factors, by, around, 1870, corsica, had, landed, in, the, french, cultural, world, from, the, 19th, century, into, the, mid, 20th, century, corsicans, also, grew, closer, to, the, french, nation, through, participation, in, the, french, empire, compared, to, much, of, metropolitan, france, corsica, was, poor, and, many, corsicans, emigrated, while, corsicans, emigrated, globally, especially, to, many, south, american, countries, many, chose, to, move, within, the, french, empire, which, acted, as, a, conduit, for, emigration, and, eventual, return, as, many, young, corsican, men, could, find, better, job, opportunities, in, the, far, corners, of, the, empire, where, many, other, french, hesitated, to, go, in, many, parts, of, the, empire, corsicans, were, strongly, represented, such, as, in, saigon, where, in, 1926, 12, of, europeans, were, from, corsica, across, the, french, empire, many, corsicans, retained, a, sense, of, community, by, establishing, organizations, where, they, would, meet, regularly, keep, one, another, informed, of, developments, in, corsica, and, come, to, one, another, s, aid, in, times, of, need, after, the, collapse, of, france, to, the, german, wehrmacht, in, 1940, corsica, came, under, the, rule, of, the, vichy, french, regime, which, was, collaborating, with, nazi, germany, in, november, 1942, the, island, was, occupied, by, italian, and, german, forces, following, the, anglo, american, landings, in, north, africa, after, the, italian, armistice, in, september, 1943, italian, and, free, french, forces, pushed, the, germans, out, of, the, island, making, corsica, the, first, french, department, to, be, freed, during, the, may, 1958, crisis, the, french, military, command, in, algeria, mutinied, against, the, french, fourth, republic, and, on, 24, may, occupied, the, island, in, an, action, called, op, ration, corse, that, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, government, the, second, phase, of, the, coup, attempt, occupying, paris, was, cancelled, following, the, establishment, of, a, transitional, government, under, charles, de, gaulle, between, the, late, 1950s, and, the, 1970s, proposals, to, conduct, underground, nuclear, tests, in, the, argentella, mines, the, immigration, of, 18, 000, former, settlers, from, algeria, pieds, noirs, in, the, eastern, plains, and, continuing, chemical, pollution, fanghi, rossi, from, mainland, italy, increased, tensions, between, the, indigenous, inhabitants, and, the, french, government, tensions, escalated, until, an, armed, police, assault, on, a, pieds, noirs, owned, wine, cellar, in, aleria, occupied, by, corsican, nationalists, on, 23, august, 1975, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, corsican, conflict, an, armed, nationalist, struggle, against, the, french, government, ever, since, corsican, nationalism, has, been, a, feature, of, the, island, s, politics, with, calls, for, greater, autonomy, and, protection, for, corsican, culture, and, the, corsican, language, or, even, full, independence, some, groups, supporting, independence, such, as, the, national, liberation, front, of, corsica, have, carried, out, a, violent, campaign, that, includes, bombings, and, assassinations, targeting, buildings, and, officials, representing, the, french, government, periodic, flare, ups, of, raids, and, killings, culminated, in, the, assassination, of, prefect, claude, rignac, in, 1998, lately, the, drive, towards, independence, has, taken, a, more, electoral, approach, where, corsicans, elected, pro, autonomist, or, pro, independence, parties, overwhelmingly, in, the, past, few, elections, in, 2018, corsica, had, the, highest, murder, rate, in, france, in, march, 2022, corsica, saw, large, protests, and, riots, after, yvan, colonna, the, murderer, of, claude, rignac, was, murdered, in, prison, the, august, 2022, corsica, derecho, swept, across, the, island, and, killed, six, people,

red, deer, was, re, introduced, after, it, was, extinct, due, to, overhunting, this, corsican, subspecies, was, the, same, that, survived, on, sardinia, so, it, is, endemic, there, are, other, species, endemic, to, corsica, especially, in, the, upper, mountain, ranges, i, e, corsican, nuthatch, corsican, fire, salamander, and, corsican, brook, salamander, and, many, plant, subspecies, corsica, like, all, the, other, mediterranean, islands, was, home, to, endemic, mammals, during, the, late, pleistocene, most, or, all, of, these, are, shared, with, sardinia, as, sardinia, was, joined, to, corsica, for, much, of, the, pleistocene, after, the, arrival, of, humans, during, mesolithic, around, 8000, bc, these, began, to, disappear, some, of, the, smaller, mammals, managed, to, survive, until, at, least, the, early, iron, age, but, are, now, all, extinct, extinct, mammals, formerly, native, to, corsica, include, the, sardinian, dhole, the, mustelid, enhydrictis, galictoides, the, deer, praemegaceros, cazioti, the, corsican, giant, shrew, tyrrhenian, mole, sardinian, pika, tyrrhenian, vole, and, the, tyrrhenian, field, rat, as, of, the, january, 2024, estimate, corsica, has, a, population, of, 355, 528, inhabitants, at, the, 2019, census, 55, 7, of, the, inhabitants, of, corsica, were, people, born, on, the, island, 29, 9, were, from, continental, france, 0, 3, were, natives, of, overseas, france, and, 14, 1, were, born, in, foreign, countries, the, majority, of, the, foreign, immigrants, in, corsica, come, from, the, maghreb, particularly, moroccans, who, made, up, 29, 0, of, all, immigrants, in, corsica, at, the, 2019, census, and, from, southern, europe, particularly, portuguese, and, italians, 23, 9, and, 12, 5, of, immigrants, on, the, island, respectively, french, fran, ais, is, the, official, and, most, widely, spoken, language, on, the, island, italian, was, the, official, language, of, corsica, until, 9, may, 1859, when, it, was, replaced, by, french, corsican, corsu, a, minority, language, that, is, closely, related, to, medieval, tuscan, toscano, has, a, better, prospect, of, survival, than, most, other, french, regional, languages, corsican, is, the, second, most, widely, spoken, language, after, french, however, since, the, annexation, of, the, island, by, france, in, the, 18th, century, corsican, has, been, under, heavy, pressure, from, french, and, today, it, is, estimated, that, only, 10, of, corsica, s, population, speak, the, language, natively, with, only, 50, having, some, sort, of, proficiency, in, it, the, corsican, language, is, divided, into, two, main, varieties, cismuntanu, and, ultramuntanu, spoken, respectively, northeast, and, southwest, of, the, girolata, porto, vecchio, line, this, division, was, due, to, the, massive, immigration, from, tuscany, which, took, place, in, corsica, during, the, lower, middle, ages, as, a, result, the, cismuntanu, became, very, similar, to, the, tuscan, dialects, being, part, of, the, italo, dalmatian, language, group, while, the, ultramuntanu, maintained, its, original, characteristics, which, make, it, much, more, similar, to, a, southern,
