but, since, the, great, recession, it, has, stabilised, and, experienced, significant, population, growth, and, uneven, economic, growth, there, has, nonetheless, been, substantial, international, investment, and, speculation, in, the, city, s, financial, and, property, markets, development, on, the, urban, fringes, of, the, city, has, occurred, in, areas, such, as, borrowdale, glen, lorne,

highest, population, increase, and, urban, development, of, any, major, zimbabwean, city, since, 2000, with, other, cities, such, as, bulawayo, gweru, and, mutare, largely, stagnating, during, the,

metropolitan, area, population, will, reach, 4, to, 5, million, have, sparked, concerns, over, unchecked, sprawl, and, unregulated, development, the, concentration, of, real, estate, development, in, harare, has, also, come, at, the, expense, of, other, zimbabwean, cities, such, as, gweru, and, particularly, bulawayo, which, is, increasingly, characterized, by, stagnation, and, high, unemployment, due, to, the, collapse, of, many, of, its, heavy, industries, today, harare, s, property, market, remains, highly, priced, more, so, than, regional, cities, such, as, johannesburg, and, cape, town,

than, a, tropical, or, subtropical, climate, the, average, annual, temperature, is, 17, 95, c, 64, 3, f, rather, low, for, the, tropics, this, is, due, to, its, high, altitude, position, and, the, prevalence, of, cool, south, easterly, airflow, there, are, three, main, seasons, a, warm, wet, summer, from, november, to, march, april, a, cool, dry, winter, from, may, to, august, corresponding, to, winter, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, a, warm, to, hot, dry, season, in, september, october, daily, temperature, ranges, are, about, 7, 22, c, 45, 72, f, in, july, the, coldest, month,

varies, a, great, deal, from, year, to, year, and, follows, cycles, of, wet, and, dry, periods, from, 7, to, 10, years, long, records, begin, in, october, 1890, but, all, three, harare, stations, stopped, reporting, in, early, 2004, the, climate, supports, the, natural, vegetation, of, open, woodland, the, most, common, tree, of, the, local, region, is, the, msasa, or, brachystegia, spiciformis, whose, wine, red, leaves, are, most, visible, in, the, city, in, late, august, two, introduced, species, of, trees, the, jacaranda, and, the, flamboyant, from, south, america, and,

international, trade, centre, for, tobacco, maize, cotton, and, citrus, fruits, manufacturing, of, products, including, textiles, steel, and, chemicals, is, also, economically, significant, as, is, the, trade, of, precious, minerals, such, as, gold, diamonds, and, platinum, early, investor, optimism, following, the, inauguration, of, the, mnangagwa, government, in, 2017, has, since, largely, subsided, due, to, the, slow, pace, of, reforms, aimed, at, making, harare, and, zimbabwe, more, business, firnedly, the, economy, suffered, high, inflation, and, frequent, power, outages, in, 2019, which, further, hampered, investment, and, the, poor, implementation, of, adequate, monetary, reforms, alongside, deficit, reduction, attempts, had, a, similar, effect, although, the, government, has, repeatedly, stressed, its, commitments, to, improving, transparency, increasing, the, ease, of, doing, business, and, fighting, corruption, progress, remains, limited, under, the, mnangagwa, administration, harare, experienced, a, real, estate, boom, in, the, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, particularly, in, the, wealthy, northern, suburbs, with, prices, rising, dramatically, over, the, last, decade, despite, challenges, in, other, sectors, of, the, economy, this, boom, was, largely, fueled, by, members, of, the, zimbabwean, diaspora, and, by, speculation, with, investors, hedging, against, the, local, currency, however, the, once, growing, market, began, to, cool, off, due, to, a, 2019, hike, in, interest, rates, and, the, economic, fallout, from, the, covid, 19, pandemic, leaving, a, number, of, projects, unfinished, another, challenge, to, harare, s, economy, is, the, persistent, emigration, of, highly, educated, and, skilled, residents, to, the, united, kingdom, australia, canada, ireland, and, new, zealand, largely, due, to, the, economic, downturn, and, political, unrest, the, city, s, brain, drain, almost, unprecedented, compared, to, other, emerging, markets, has, led, to, declining, numbers, of, local, entrepreneurs, an, overstretched, and, declining, middle, class, and, a, dearth, of, employment, opportunities, outside, the, informal, and, public, sector, in, addition, the, city, s, working, class, residents, are, increasingly, moving, to, nearby, south, africa, and, botswana, though, they, are, readily, replaced, by, less, well, off, rural, migrants, however, despite, over, a, decade, of, neglect, the, city, s, infrastructure, and, human, capital, still, compares, favourably, with, cities, in, other, parts, of, africa, and, latin, america, it, remains, to, be, seen, whether, the, current, government, can, entice, its, diverse, and, well, educated, zimbabwean, diaspora, numbering, some, 4, to, 7, million, people, to, invest, in, the, economy, let, alone, consider, returning, locally, produced, art, handicrafts, and, souvenirs, can, be, purchased, at, locations, including, doon, estate, uwminsdale, avondale, market, and, mbare, musika, msasa, park, and, umwinsdale, in, particular, host, a, number, of, galleries, that, produce, high, quality, shona, soapstone, sculptures, and, textiles, such, as, patrick, mavros, studios, which, has, another, gallery, in, knightsbridge, london, international, brands, are, generally, less, common, in, harare, than, in, european, cities, however, conventional, and, luxury, shopping, can, be, found, on, fife, avenue, sam, nujoma, union, avenue, arundel, village, avondale, borrowdale, eastgate, and, westgate, virtually, all, luxury, shopping, is, concentrated, in, the, wealthier, northern, suburbs, particularly, borrowdale, harare, is, a, relatively, young, city, mostly, growing, during, the, country, s, post, federation, and, post, independence, booms, it, was, also, segregated, along, racial, and, class, lines, until, 1976, as, a, result, harare, today, is, a, mostly, low, density, urban, area, geared, towards, private, motorists, lacking, a, convenient, public, transportation, system, very, little, investment, has, been, made, to, develop, an, effective, and, integrated, public, transportation, system, leaving, a, significant, number, of, the, city, s, residents, dependent, on, the, city, s, informal, minibus, taxis, the, rise, of, local, ridesharing, apps, such, as, gtaxi, and, hwindi, has, partly, eased, pressure, on, the, city, s, transportation, system, but, such, rides, are, still, too, expensive, for, most, working, people, to, use, in, addition, bus, services, are, also, available, but, they, are, mostly, geared, towards, intercity, travel, and, recreation, than, journeys, within, harare, itself, the, city, s, public, transport, system, includes, public, and, private, sector, operations, the, former, consists, of, zupco, buses, privately, owned, public, transport, included, licensed, station, wagons, nicknamed, emergency, taxis, until, 1993, when, the, government, began, to, replace, them, with, licensed,
