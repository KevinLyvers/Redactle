this, traffic, greatly, increased, the, prosperity, of, the, city, during, that, period, after, declaring, independence, from, colombia, on, november, 3, 1903, philippe, bunau, varilla, a, french, engineer, was, named, envoy, extraordinary, and, minister, plenipotentiary, bunau, varilla, negotiated, the, hay, bunau, varilla, treaty, of, 1903, which, provided, the, united, states, with, a, 10,

ordered, the, fumigation, of, homes, and, the, cleansing, of, water, this, led, to, yellow, fever, being, eradicated, by, november, 1905, as, well, malaria, rates, falling, dramatically, however, most, of, the, laborers, for, the, construction, of, the, canal, were, brought, in, from, the, caribbean, which, created, unprecedented, racial, and, social, tensions, in, the, city, during, world,
