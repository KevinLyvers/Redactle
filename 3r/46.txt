by, land, on, the, north, by, southern, europe, and, anatolia, on, the, south, by, north, africa, on, the, east, by, the, levant, in, west, asia, and, on, the, west, almost, by, the, morocco, spain, border, the, mediterranean, has, played, a, central, role, in, the, history, of, western, civilization, geological, evidence, indicates, that, around, 5, 9, million, years, ago, the, mediterranean, was, cut, off, from, the, atlantic, and, was, partly, or, completely, desiccated, over, a, period, of, some, 600, 000, years, during, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, before, being, refilled, by, the, zanclean, flood, about, 5, 3, million, years, ago, the, mediterranean, sea, covers, an, area, of, about, 2, 500, 000, km, 2, 970, 000, sq, mi, representing, 0, 7, of, the, global, ocean, surface, but, its, connection, to, the, atlantic, via, the, strait, of, gibraltar, the, narrow, strait, that, connects, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, separates, the, iberian, peninsula, in, europe, from, morocco, in, africa, is, only, 14, km, 9, mi, wide, the, mediterranean, sea, encompasses, a, vast, number, of, islands, some, of, them, of, volcanic, origin, the, two, largest, islands, in, both, area, and, population, are, sicily, and, sardinia, the, mediterranean, sea, has, an, average, depth, of, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, and, the, deepest, recorded, point, is, 5,

shorelines, and, whether, only, straight, routes, are, considered, also, including, longitudinal, changes, the, shortest, shipping, route, between, the, multinational, gulf, of, trieste, and, the, libyan, coastline, of, the, gulf, of, sidra, is, about, 1, 900, kilometres, 1, 200, mi, the, water, temperatures, are, mild, in, winter, and, warm, in, summer, and, give, name, to, the, mediterranean, climate, type, due, to, the, majority, of, precipitation, falling, in, the, cooler, months, its, southern, and, eastern, coastlines, are, lined, with, hot, deserts, not, far, inland, but, the, immediate, coastline, on, all, sides, of, the, mediterranean, tends, to, have, strong, maritime, moderation, the, sea, was, an, important, route, for, merchants, and, travellers, of, ancient, times, facilitating, trade, and, cultural, exchange, between, the, peoples, of, the, region, the, history, of, the, mediterranean, region, is, crucial, to, understanding, the, origins, and, development, of, many, modern, societies, the, roman, empire, maintained, nautical, hegemony, over, the, sea, for, centuries, and, is, the, only, state, to, have, ever, controlled, all, of, its, coast, the, countries, surrounding, the, mediterranean, and, its, marginal, seas, in, clockwise, order, are, spain, france, monaco, italy, slovenia, croatia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, montenegro, albania, greece, turkey, syria, lebanon, israel, palestine, egypt, libya, tunisia, algeria, and, morocco, malta, and, cyprus, are, island, countries, in, the, sea, in, addition, two, overseas, territories, of, the, united, kingdom, gibraltar, and, akrotiri, and, dhekelia, have, coastlines, on, the, mediterranean, the, drainage, basin, encompasses, a, large, number, of, other, countries, the, nile, being, the, longest, river, ending, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, ancient, egyptians, called, the, mediterranean, wadj, wr, wadj, wer, wadj, ur, this, term, literally, great, green, was, the, name, given, by, the, ancient, egyptians, to, the, semi, solid, semi, aquatic, region, characterized, by, papyrus, forests, to, the, north, of, the, cultivated, nile, delta, and, by, extension, the, sea, beyond, the,

mediterr, neum, appears, later, solinus, apparently, used, this, in, the, 3rd, century, but, the, earliest, extant, witness, to, it, is, in, the, 6th, century, in, isidore, of, seville, it, means, in,

latin, name, from, m, sos, in, the, middle, and, g, inos, of, the, earth, from, g, land, earth, the, original, meaning, may, have, been, the, sea, in, the, middle, of, the, earth, rather, than, the, sea, enclosed, by, land, ancient, iranians, called, it, the, roman, sea, and, in, classical, persian, texts, it, was, called, dary, y, e, r, m, which, may, be, from, middle, persian, form, zr, h, hr,

numbers, book, of, joshua, ezekiel, or, simply, as, the, sea, 1, kings, however, it, has, also, been, called, the, hinder, sea, because, of, its, location, on, the, west, coast, of, the, region, of, syria, or, the, holy, land, and, therefore, behind, a, person, facing, the, east, which, is, sometimes, translated, as, western, sea, another, name, was, the, sea, of, the, philistines, book, of,

literature, it, was, ba, r, al, r, m, or, the, sea, of, the, romans, or, the, roman, sea, at, first, that, name, referred, only, to, the, eastern, mediterranean, but, the, term, was, later, extended, to, the, whole, mediterranean, other, arabic, names, were, ba, r, al, m, the, sea, of, syria, and, ba, r, al, maghrib, the, sea, of, the, west, in, turkish, it, is, the, akdeniz, the, white, sea, in, ottoman, which, sometimes, means, only, the, aegean, sea, the, origin, of, the, name, is, not, clear, as, it, is, not, known, in, earlier, greek, byzantine, or, islamic, sources, it, may, be, to, contrast, with, the, black, sea, in, persian, the, name, was, translated, as, ba, r, i, saf, d, which, was, also, used, in, later, ottoman, turkish, similarly, in, 19th, century, greek, the, name,

colonization, and, war, as, well, as, food, from, fishing, and, the, gathering, of, other, seafood, for, numerous, communities, throughout, the, ages, the, earliest, advanced, civilizations, in, the, mediterranean, were, the, egyptians, and, the, minoans, who, traded, extensively, with, each, other, other, notable, civilizations, that, appeared, somewhat, later, are, the, hittites, and, other, anatolian, peoples, the, phoenicians, and, mycenean, greece, around, 1200, bc, the, eastern, mediterranean, was, greatly, affected, by, the, bronze, age, collapse, which, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, many, cities, and, trade, routes, the, most, notable, mediterranean, civilizations, in, classical, antiquity, were, the, greek, city, states, and, the, phoenicians, both, of, which, extensively, colonized, the, coastlines, of, the, mediterranean, darius, i, of, persia, who, conquered, ancient, egypt, built, a, canal, linking, the, red, sea, to, the, nile, and, thus, the, mediterranean, darius, s, canal, was, wide, enough, for, two, triremes, to, pass, each, other, with, oars, extended, and, required, four, days, to, traverse, following, the, punic, wars, in, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, centuries, bc, the, roman, republic, defeated, the, carthaginians, to, become, the, preeminent, power, in, the, mediterranean, when, augustus, founded, the, roman, empire, the, romans, referred, to, the, mediterranean, as, mare, nostrum, our, sea, for, the, next, 400, years, the, roman, empire, completely, controlled, the, mediterranean, sea, and, virtually, all, its, coastal, regions, from, gibraltar, to, the, levant, being, the, only, state, in, history, to, ever, do, so, being, given, the, nickname, roman, lake, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, around, 476, ad, the, east, was, again, dominant, as, roman, power, lived, on, in, the, byzantine, empire, formed, in, the, 4th, century, from, the, eastern, half, of, the, roman, empire, though, the, eastern, roman, empire, would, continue, to, hold, almost, all, of, the, mediterranean, another, power, arose, in, the, 7th, century, and, with, it, the, religion, of, islam, which, soon, swept, across, from, the, east, at, its, greatest, extent, the, arabs, under, the, umayyads, controlled, most, of, the, mediterranean, region, and, left, a, lasting, footprint, on, its, eastern, and, southern, shores, the, arab, invasions, disrupted, the, trade, relations, between, western, and, eastern, europe, while, disrupting, trade, routes, with, eastern, asian, empires, this, however, had, the, indirect, effect, of, promoting, trade, across, the, caspian, sea, the, export, of, grains, from, egypt, was, re, routed, towards, the, eastern, world, products, from, east, asian, empires, like, silk, and, spices, were, carried, from, egypt, to, ports, like, venice, and, constantinople, by, sailors, and, jewish, merchants, the, viking, raids, further, disrupted, the, trade, in, western, europe, and, brought, it, to, a, halt, however, the, norsemen, developed, the, trade, from, norway, to, the, white, sea, while, also, trading, in, luxury, goods, from, spain, and, the, mediterranean, the, byzantines, in, the, mid, 8th, century, retook, control, of, the, area, around, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, mediterranean, venetian, ships, from, the, 9th, century, armed, themselves, to, counter, the, harassment, by, arabs, while, concentrating, trade, of, asian, goods, in, venice, the, fatimids, maintained, trade, relations, with, the, italian, city, states, like, amalfi, and, genoa, before, the, crusades, according, to, the, cairo, geniza, documents, a, document, dated, 996, mentions, amalfian, merchants, living, in, cairo, another, letter, states, that, the, genoese, had, traded, with, alexandria, the, caliph, al, mustansir, had, allowed, amalfian, merchants, to, reside, in, jerusalem, about, 1060, in, place, of, the, latin, hospice, the, crusades, led, to, the, flourishing, of, trade, between, europe, and, the, outremer, region, genoa, venice, and, pisa, created, colonies, in, regions, controlled, by, the, crusaders, and, came, to, control, the, trade, with, the, orient, these, colonies, also, allowed, them, to, trade, with, the, eastern, world, though, the, fall, of, the, crusader, states, and, attempts, at, banning, of, trade, relations, with, muslim, states, by, the, popes, temporarily, disrupted, the, trade, with, the, orient, it, however, continued, europe, started, to, revive, however, as, more, organized, and, centralized, states, began, to, form, in, the, later, middle, ages, after, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, ottoman, power, based, in, anatolia, continued, to, grow, and, in, 1453, extinguished, the, byzantine, empire, with, the, conquest, of, constantinople, ottomans, gained, control, of, much, of, the, eastern, part, sea, in, the, 16th, century, and, also, maintained, naval, bases, in, southern, france, 1543, 1544, algeria, and, tunisia, barbarossa, the, ottoman, captain, is, a, symbol, of, this, domination, with, the, victory, of, the, battle, of, preveza, 1538, the, battle, of, djerba, 1560, marked, the, apex, of, ottoman, naval, domination, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, as, the, naval, prowess, of, the, european, powers, increased, they, confronted, ottoman, expansion, in, the, region, when, the, battle, of, lepanto, 1571, checked, the, power, of, the, ottoman, navy, this, was, the, last, naval, battle, to, be, fought, primarily, between, galleys, the, barbary, pirates, of, northwest, africa, preyed, on, christian, shipping, and, coastlines, in, the, western, mediterranean, sea, according, to, robert, davis, from, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, pirates, captured, 1, million, to, 1, 25, million, europeans, as, slaves, the, development, of, oceanic, shipping, began, to, affect, the, entire, mediterranean, once, most, of, the, trade, between, western, europe, and, the, east, was, passing, through, the, region, but, after, the, 1490s, the, development, of, a, sea, route, to, the, indian, ocean, allowed, the, importation, of, asian, spices, and, other, goods, through, the, atlantic, ports, of, western, europe, the, sea, remained, strategically, important, british, mastery, of, gibraltar, ensured, their, influence, in, africa, and, southwest, asia, especially, after, the, naval, battles, of, abukir, 1799, battle, of, the, nile, and, trafalgar, 1805, the, british, had, for, a, long, time, strengthened, their, dominance, in, the, mediterranean, wars, included, naval, warfare, in, the, mediterranean, during, world, war, i, and, mediterranean, theatre, of, world, war, ii, with, the, opening, of, the, lockless, suez, canal, in, 1869, the, flow, of, trade, between, europe, and, asia, changed, fundamentally, the, fastest, route, now, led, through, the, mediterranean, towards, east, africa, and, asia, this, led, to, a, preference, for, the, mediterranean, countries, and, their, ports, like, trieste, with, direct, connections, to, central, and, eastern, europe, experienced, a, rapid, economic, rise, in, the, 20th, century, the, 1st, and, 2nd, world, wars, as, well, as, the, suez, crisis, and, the, cold, war, led, to, a, shift, of, trade, routes, to, the, european, northern, ports, which, changed, again, towards, the, southern, ports, through, european, integration, the, activation, of, the, silk, road, and, free, world, trade, in, 2013, the, maltese, president, described, the, mediterranean, sea, as, a, cemetery, due, to, the, large, number, of, migrants, who, drowned, there, after, their, boats, capsized, european, parliament, president, martin, schulz, said, in, 2014, that, europe, s, migration, policy, turned, the, mediterranean, into, a, graveyard, referring, to, the, number, of, drowned, refugees, in, the, region, as, a, direct, result, of, the, policies, an, azerbaijani, official, described, the, sea, as, a, burial, ground, where, people, die, following, the, 2013, lampedusa, migrant, shipwreck, the, italian, government, decided, to, strengthen, the, national, system, for, the, patrolling, of, the, mediterranean, sea, by, authorising, operation, mare, nostrum, a, military, and, humanitarian, mission, in, order, to, rescue, the, migrants, and, arrest, the, traffickers, of, immigrants, in, 2015, more, than, one, million, migrants, crossed, the, mediterranean, sea, into, europe, italy, was, particularly, affected, by, the, european, migrant, crisis, since, 2013, over, 700, 000, migrants, have, landed, in, italy, mainly, sub,

the, suez, canal, in, the, east, the, mediterranean, sea, is, bounded, by, the, coasts, of, europe, africa, and, asia, and, is, divided, into, two, deep, basins, the, drainage, basin, of, the, mediterranean, sea, is, particularly, heterogeneous, and, extends, much, further, than, the, mediterranean, region, its, size, has, been, estimated, between, 4, 000, 000, and, 5, 500, 000, km, 2, 1, 500, 000, and, 2, 100, 000, sq, mi, depending, on, whether, non, active, parts, deserts, are, included, or, not, the, longest, river, ending, in, the, mediterranean, sea, is, the, nile, which, takes, its, sources, in, equatorial, africa, the, basin, of, the, nile, constitutes, about, two, thirds, of, the, mediterranean, drainage, basin, and, encompasses, areas, as, high, as, the, ruwenzori,

basin, especially, near, the, alps, the, water, tower, of, europe, and, other, high, mountain, ranges, as, a, consequence, the, river, discharges, of, the, rh, ne, and, po, are, similar, to, that, of, the, nile, despite, the, latter, having, a, much, larger, basin, these, are, the, only, three, rivers, with, an, average, discharge, of, over, 1, 000, m, 3, s, 35, 000, cu, ft, s, among, large,

while, most, of, italy, s, northern, adriatic, coast, has, a, humid, subtropical, climate, although, they, are, rare, tropical, cyclones, occasionally, form, in, the, mediterranean, sea, typically, in, september, november, being, nearly, landlocked, affects, conditions, in, the, mediterranean, sea, for, instance, tides, are, very, limited, as, a, result, of, the, narrow, connection, with, the, atlantic, ocean, the, mediterranean, is, characterised, and, immediately, recognised, by, its, deep, blue, colour, evaporation, greatly, exceeds, precipitation, and, river, runoff, in, the, mediterranean, a, fact, that, is, central, to, the, water, circulation, within, the, basin, evaporation, is, especially, high, in, its, eastern, half, causing, the, water, level, to, decrease, and, salinity, to, increase, eastward, the, average, salinity, in, the, basin, is, 38, psu, at, 5, m, 16, ft, depth, the, temperature, of, the, water, in, the, deepest, part, of, the, mediterranean, sea, is, 13, 2, c, 55, 8, f, the, net, water, influx, from, the, atlantic, ocean, is, ca, 70, 000, m, 3, s, 2, 5, million, cu, ft, s, or, 2, 2, 10, 12, m, 3, a, 7, 8, 10, 13, cu, ft, a, without, this, atlantic, water, the, sea, level, of, the, mediterranean, sea, would, fall, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, m, 3, ft, per, year, in, oceanography, it, is, sometimes, called, the, eurafrican, mediterranean, sea, the, european, mediterranean, sea, or, the, african, mediterranean, sea, to, distinguish, it, from, mediterranean, seas, elsewhere, water, circulation, in, the, mediterranean, can, be, attributed, to, the, surface, waters, entering, from, the, atlantic, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, also, low, salinity, water, entering, the, mediterranean, from, the, black, sea, through, the, bosphorus, the, cool, and, relatively, low, salinity, atlantic, water, circulates, eastwards, along, the, north, african, coasts, a, part, of, the, surface, water, does, not, pass, the, strait, of, sicily, but, deviates, towards, corsica, before, exiting, the, mediterranean, the, surface, waters, entering, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, circulate, along, the, libyan, and, israeli, coasts, upon, reaching, the, levantine, sea, the, surface, waters, having, warmed, and, increased, its, salinity, from, its, initial, atlantic, state, is, now, denser, and, sinks, to, form, the, levantine, intermediate, waters, liw, most, of, the, water, found, anywhere, between, 50, and, 600, m, 160, and, 2, 000, ft, deep, in, the, mediterranean, originates, from, the, liw, liw, are, formed, along, the, coasts, of, turkey, and, circulate, westwards, along, the, greek, and, south, italian, coasts, liw, are, the, only, waters, passing, the, sicily, strait, westwards, after, the, strait, of,

mediterranean, originates, from, three, main, areas, the, adriatic, sea, from, which, most, of, the, deep, water, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, originates, the, aegean, sea, and, the, gulf, of, lion, deep, water, formation, in, the, mediterranean, is, triggered, by, strong, winter, convection, fueled, by, intense, cold, winds, like, the, bora, when, new, deep, water, is, formed, the, older, waters, mix, with, the, overlaying, intermediate, waters, and, eventually, exit, the, mediterranean, the, residence, time, of, water, in, the, mediterranean, is, approximately, 100, years, making, the, mediterranean, especially, sensitive, to, climate, change, being, a, semi, enclosed, basin, the, mediterranean, experiences, transitory, events, that, can, affect, the, water, circulation, on, short, time, scales, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, aegean, sea, became, the, main, area, for, deep, water, formation, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, after, particularly, cold, winter, conditions, this, transitory, switch, in, the, origin, of, deep, waters, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, was, termed, eastern, mediterranean, transient, emt, and, had, major, consequences, on, water, circulation, of, the, mediterranean, another, example, of, a, transient, event, affecting, the, mediterranean, circulation, is, the, periodic, inversion, of, the, north, ionian, gyre, which, is, an, anticyclonic, ocean, gyre, observed, in, the, northern, part, of, the, ionian, sea, off, the, greek, coast, the, transition, from, anticyclonic, to, cyclonic, rotation, of, this, gyre, changes, the, origin, of, the, waters, fueling, it, when, the, circulation, is, anticyclonic, most, common, the, waters, of, the, gyre, originate, from, the, adriatic, sea, when, the, circulation, is, cyclonic, the, waters, originate, from, the, levantine, sea, these, waters, have, different, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, and, the, periodic, inversion, of, the, north, ionian, gyre, called, bimodal, oscillating, system, or, bios, changes, the, mediterranean, circulation, and, biogeochemistry, around, the, adriatic, and, levantine, regions, because, of, the, short, residence, time, of, waters, the, mediterranean, sea, is, considered, a, hot, spot, for, climate, change, effects, deep, water, temperatures, have, increased, by, 0, 12, c, 0, 22, f, between, 1959, and, 1989, according, to, climate, projections, the, mediterranean, sea, could, become, warmer, the, decrease, in, precipitation, over, the, region, could, lead, to, more, evaporation, ultimately, increasing, the, mediterranean, sea, salinity, because, of, the, changes, in, temperature, and, salinity, the, mediterranean, sea, may, become, more, stratified, by, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, with, notable, consequences, on, water, circulation, and, biogeochemistry, the, stratification, and, warming, have, already, led, to, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, become, a, net, source, of, co, 2, to, the, atmosphere, notably, during, summer, this, strong, summer, degassing, combined, with, the, prolonged, and, pronounced, stratification, results, in, the, formation, of, aragonite, crystals, abiotically, in, the, water, column, the, cumulative, warming, at, the, surface, of, the, mediterranean, has, a, significant, impact, on, the, ecological, system, extreme, warming, has, led, to, biodiversity, loss, and, presents, an, existential, threat, to, some, habitats, while, making, conditions, more, hospitable, to, invasive, tropical, species, in, spite, of, its, great, biodiversity, concentrations, of, chlorophyll, and, nutrients, in, the, mediterranean, sea, are, very, low, making, it, one, of, the, most, oligotrophic, ocean, regions, in, the, world, the, mediterranean, sea, is, commonly, referred, to, as, an, lnlc, low, nutrient, low, chlorophyll, area, the, mediterranean, sea, fits, the, definition, of, a, desert, in, which, its, nutrient, contents, are, low, making, it, difficult, for, plants, and, animals, to, develop, there, are, steep, gradients, in, nutrient, concentrations, chlorophyll, concentrations, and, primary, productivity, in, the, mediterranean, nutrient, concentrations, in, the, western, part, of, the, basin, are, about, double, the, concentrations, in, the, eastern, basin, the, alboran, sea, close, to, the, strait, of, gibraltar, has, a, daily, primary, productivity, of, about, 0, 25, g, c, grams, of, carbon, m, 2, day, 1, whereas, the, eastern, basin, has, an, average, daily, productivity, of, 0, 16, g, c, m, 2, day, 1, for, this, reason, the, eastern, part, of, the, mediterranean, sea, is, termed, ultraoligotrophic, the, productive, areas, of, the, mediterranean, sea, are, few, and, small, high, i, e, more, than, 0, 5, grams, of, chlorophyll, a, per, cubic, meter, productivity, occurs, in, coastal, areas, close, to, the, river, mouths, which, are, the, primary, suppliers, of, dissolved, nutrients, the, gulf, of, lion, has, a, relatively, high, productivity, because, it, is, an, area, of, high, vertical, mixing, bringing, nutrients, to, the, surface, waters, that, can, be, used, by, phytoplankton, to, produce, chlorophyll, a, primary, productivity, in, the, mediterranean, is, also, marked, by, an, intense, seasonal, variability, in, winter, the, strong, winds, and, precipitation, over, the, basin, generate, vertical, mixing, bringing, nutrients, from, the, deep, waters, to, the, surface, where, phytoplankton, can, convert, it, into, biomass, however, in, winter, light, may, be, the, limiting, factor, for, primary, productivity, between, march, and, april, spring, offers, the, ideal, trade, off, between, light, intensity, and, nutrient, concentrations, in, surface, for, a, spring, bloom, to, occur, in, summer, high, atmospheric, temperatures, lead, to, the, warming, of, the, surface, waters, the, resulting, density, difference, virtually, isolates, the, surface, waters, from, the, rest, of, the, water, column, and, nutrient, exchanges, are, limited, as, a, consequence, primary, productivity, is, very, low, between, june, and, october, oceanographic, expeditions, uncovered, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, mediterranean, sea, biogeochemistry, most, of, the, chlorophyll, production, does, not, occur, on, the, surface, but, in, sub, surface, waters, between, 80, and, 200, meters, deep, another, key, characteristic, of, the, mediterranean, is, its, high, nitrogen, to, phosphorus, ratio, n, p, redfield, demonstrated, that, most, of, the, world, s, oceans, have, an, average, n, p, ratio, around, 16, however, the, mediterranean, sea, has, an, average, n, p, between, 24, and, 29, which, translates, a, widespread, phosphorus, limitation, because, of, its, low, productivity, plankton, assemblages, in, the, mediterranean, sea, are, dominated, by, small, organisms, such, as, picophytoplankton, and, bacteria, the, geologic, history, of, the, mediterranean, sea, is, complex, underlain, by, oceanic, crust, the, sea, basin, was, once, thought, to, be, a, tectonic, remnant, of, the, ancient, tethys, ocean, it, is, now, known, to, be, a, structurally, younger, basin, called, the, neotethys, which, was, first, formed, by, the, convergence, of, the, african, and, eurasian, plates, during, the, late, triassic, and, early, jurassic, because, it, is, a, near, landlocked, body, of, water, in, a, normally, dry, climate, the, mediterranean, is, subject, to, intensive, evaporation, and, the, precipitation, of, evaporites, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, started, about, six, million, years, ago, mya, when, the, mediterranean, became, landlocked, and, then, essentially, dried, up, there, are, salt, deposits, accumulated, on, the, bottom, of, the, basin, of, more, than, a, million, cubic, kilometres, in, some, places, more, than, three, kilometres, thick, scientists, estimate, that, the, sea, was, last, filled, about, 5, 3, million, years, ago, mya, in, less, than, two, years, by, the, zanclean, flood, water, poured, in, from, the, atlantic, ocean, through, a, newly, breached, gateway, now, called, the, strait, of, gibraltar, at, an, estimated, rate, of, about, three, orders, of, magnitude, one, thousand, times, larger, than, the, current, flow, of, the, amazon, river, the, mediterranean, sea, has, an, average, depth, of, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, and, the, deepest, recorded, point, is, 5, 267, m, 17, 280, ft, in, the, calypso, deep, in, the, ionian, sea, the, coastline, extends, for, 46, 000, km, 29, 000, mi, a, shallow, submarine, ridge, the, strait, of, sicily, between, the, island, of, sicily, and, the, coast, of, tunisia, divides, the, sea, in, two, main, subregions, the, western, mediterranean, with, an, area, of, about, 850, 000, km, 2, 330, 000, sq, mi, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, of, about, 1, 65, million, km, 2, 640, 000, sq, mi, coastal, areas, have, submarine, karst, springs, or, vrulja, s, which, discharge, pressurised, groundwater, into, the, water, from, below, the, surface, the, discharge, water, is, usually, fresh, and, sometimes, may, be, thermal, the, mediterranean, basin, and, sea, system, were, established, by, the, ancient, african, arabian, continent, colliding, with, the, eurasian, continent, as, africa, arabia, drifted, northward, it, closed, over, the, ancient, tethys, ocean, which, had, earlier, separated, the, two, supercontinents, laurasia, and, gondwana, at, about, that, time, in, the, middle, jurassic, period, roughly, 170, million, years, ago, a, much, smaller, sea, basin, dubbed, the, neotethys, was, formed, shortly, before, the, tethys, ocean, closed, at, its, western, arabian, end, the, broad, line, of, collisions, pushed, up, a, very, long, system, of, mountains, from, the, pyrenees, in, spain, to, the, zagros, mountains, in, iran, in, an, episode, of, mountain, building, tectonics, known, as, the, alpine, orogeny, the, neotethys, grew, larger, during, the, episodes, of, collisions, and, associated, foldings, and, subductions, that, occurred, during, the, oligocene, and, miocene, epochs, 34, to, 5, 33, mya, see, animation, africa, arabia, colliding, with, eurasia, accordingly, the, mediterranean, basin, consists, of, several, stretched, tectonic, plates, in, subduction, which, are, the, foundation, of, the, eastern, part, of, the, mediterranean, sea, various, zones, of, subduction, contain, the, highest, oceanic, ridges, east, of, the, ionian, sea, and, south, of, the, aegean, the, central, indian, ridge, runs, east, of, the, mediterranean, sea, south, east, across, the, in, between, of, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, into, the, indian, ocean, during, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, times, as, the, northwest, corner, of, africa, converged, on, iberia, it, lifted, the, betic, rif, mountain, belts, across, southern, iberia, and, northwest, africa, there, the, development, of, the, intramontane, betic, and, rif, basins, created, two, roughly, parallel, marine, gateways, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, mediterranean, sea, dubbed, the, betic, and, rifian, corridors, they, gradually, closed, during, the, middle, and, late, miocene, perhaps, several, times, in, the, late, miocene, the, closure, of, the, betic, corridor, triggered, the, so, called, messinian, salinity, crisis, msc, characterized, by, the, deposition, of, a, thick, evaporitic, sequence, with, salt, deposits, up, to, 2, km, thick, in, the, levantine, sea, and, by, a, massive, drop, in, water, level, in, much, of, the, basin, this, event, was, for, long, the, subject, of, acute, scientific, controversy, now, much, appeased, regarding, its, sequence, geographic, range, processes, leading, to, evaporite, facies, and, salt, deposits, the, start, of, the, msc, was, recently, estimated, astronomically, at, 5, 96, mya, and, it, persisted, for, some, 630, 000, years, until, about, 5, 3, mya, see, animation, messinian, salinity, crisis, at, right, after, the, initial, drawdown, and, re, flooding, there, followed, more, episodes, the, total, number, is, debated, of, sea, drawdowns, and, re, floodings, for, the, duration, of, the, msc, it, ended, when, the, atlantic, ocean, last, re, flooded, the, basin, creating, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, causing, the, zanclean, flood, at, the, end, of, the, miocene, 5, 33, mya, some, research, has, suggested, that, a, desiccation, flooding, desiccation, cycle, may, have, repeated, several, times, which, could, explain, several, events, of, large, amounts, of, salt, deposition, recent, studies, however, show, that, repeated, desiccation, and, re, flooding, is, unlikely, from, a, geodynamic, point, of, view, the, present, day, atlantic, gateway, the, strait, of, gibraltar, originated, in, the, early, pliocene, via, the, zanclean, flood, as, mentioned, there, were, two, earlier, gateways, the, betic, corridor, across, southern, spain, and, the, rifian, corridor, across, northern, morocco, the, betic, closed, about, 6, mya, causing, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, msc, the, rifian, or, possibly, both, gateways, closed, during, the, earlier, tortonian, times, causing, a, tortonian, salinity, crisis, from, 11, 6, to, 7, 2, mya, long, before, the, msc, and, lasting, much, longer, both, crises, resulted, in, broad, connections, between, the, mainlands, of, africa, and, europe, which, allowed, migrations, of, flora, and, fauna, especially, large, mammals, including, primates, between, the, two, continents, the, vallesian, crisis, indicates, a, typical, extinction, and, replacement, of, mammal, species, in, europe, during, tortonian, times, following, climatic, upheaval, and, overland, migrations, of, new, species, see, animation, messinian, salinity, crisis, and, mammal, migrations, at, right, the, almost, complete, enclosure, of, the, mediterranean, basin, has, enabled, the, oceanic, gateways, to, dominate, seawater, circulation, and, the, environmental, evolution, of, the, sea, and, basin, circulation, patterns, are, also, affected, by, several, other, factors, including, climate, bathymetry, and, water, chemistry, and, temperature, which, are, interactive, and, can, induce, precipitation, of, evaporites, deposits, of, evaporites, accumulated, earlier, in, the, nearby, carpathian, foredeep, during, the, middle, miocene, and, the, adjacent, red, sea, basin, during, the, late, miocene, and, in, the, whole, mediterranean, basin, during, the, msc, and, the, messinian, age, many, diatomites, are, found, underneath, the, evaporite, deposits, suggesting, a, connection, between, their, formations, today, evaporation, of, surface, seawater, output, is, more, than, the, supply, input, of, fresh, water, by, precipitation, and, coastal, drainage, systems, causing, the, salinity, of, the, mediterranean, to, be, much, higher, than, that, of, the, atlantic, so, much, so, that, the, saltier, mediterranean, waters, sink, below, the, waters, incoming, from, the, atlantic, causing, a, two, layer, flow, across, the, strait, of, gibraltar, that, is, an, outflow, submarine, current, of, warm, saline, mediterranean, water, counterbalanced, by, an, inflow, surface, current, of, less, saline, cold, oceanic, water, from, the, atlantic, in, the, 1920s, herman, s, rgel, proposed, the, building, of, a, hydroelectric, dam, the, atlantropa, project, across, the, straits, using, the, inflow, current, to, provide, a, large, amount, of, hydroelectric, energy, the, underlying, energy, grid, was, also, intended, to, support, a, political, union, between, europe, and, at, least, the, maghreb, part, of, africa, compare, eurafrika, for, the, later, impact, and, desertec, for, a, later, project, with, some, parallels, in, the, planned, grid, the, end, of, the, miocene, also, marked, a, change, in, the, climate, of, the, mediterranean, basin, fossil, evidence, from, that, period, reveals, that, the, larger, basin, had, a, humid, subtropical, climate, with, rainfall, in, the, summer, supporting, laurel, forests, the, shift, to, a, mediterranean, climate, occurred, largely, within, the, last, three, million, years, the, late, pliocene, epoch, as, summer, rainfall, decreased, the, subtropical, laurel, forests, retreated, and, even, as, they, persisted, on, the, islands, of, macaronesia, off, the, atlantic, coast, of, iberia, and, north, africa, the, present, mediterranean, vegetation, evolved, dominated, by, coniferous, trees, and, sclerophyllous, trees, and, shrubs, with, small, hard, waxy, leaves, that, prevent, moisture, loss, in, the, dry, summers, much, of, these, forests, and, shrublands, have, been, altered, beyond, recognition, by, thousands, of, years, of, human, habitation, there, are, now, very, few, relatively, intact, natural, areas, in, what, was, once, a, heavily, wooded, region, because, of, its, latitude, and, its, landlocked, position, the, mediterranean, is, especially, sensitive, to, astronomically, induced, climatic, variations, which, are, well, documented, in, its, sedimentary, record, since, the, mediterranean, is, subject, to, the, deposition, of, eolian, dust, from, the, sahara, during, dry, periods, whereas, riverine, detrital, input, prevails, during, wet, ones, the, mediterranean, marine, sapropel, bearing, sequences, provide, high, resolution, climatic, information, these, data, have, been, employed, in, reconstructing, astronomically, calibrated, time, scales, for, the, last, 9, ma, of, the, earth, s, history, helping, to, constrain, the, time, of, past, geomagnetic, reversals, furthermore, the, exceptional, accuracy, of, these, paleoclimatic, records, has, improved, our, knowledge, of, the, earth, s, orbital, variations, in, the, past, unlike, the, vast, multidirectional, ocean, currents, in, open, oceans, within, their, respective, oceanic, zones, biodiversity, in, the, mediterranean, sea, is, stable, due, to, the, subtle, but, strong, locked, nature, of, currents, which, is, favourable, to, life, even, the, smallest, macroscopic, type, of, volcanic, life, form, the, stable, marine, ecosystem, of, the, mediterranean, sea, and, sea, temperature, provides, a, nourishing, environment, for, life, in, the, deep, sea, to, flourish, while, assuring, a, balanced, aquatic, ecosystem, excluded, from, any, external, deep, oceanic, factors, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, more, than, 17, 000, marine, species, in, the, mediterranean, sea, with, generally, higher, marine, biodiversity, in, coastal, areas, continental, shelves, and, decreases, with, depth, as, a, result, of, the, drying, of, the, sea, during, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, the, marine, biota, of, the, mediterranean, is, derived, primarily, from, the, atlantic, ocean, the, north, atlantic, is, considerably, colder, and, more, nutrient, rich, than, the, mediterranean, and, the, marine, life, of, the, mediterranean, has, had, to, adapt, to, its, differing, conditions, in, the, five, million, years, since, the, basin, was, reflooded, the, alboran, sea, is, a, transition, zone, between, the, two, seas, containing, a, mix, of, mediterranean, and, atlantic, species, the, alboran, sea, has, the, largest, population, of, bottlenose, dolphins, in, the, western, mediterranean, is, home, to, the, last, population, of, harbour, porpoises, in, the, mediterranean, and, is, the, most, important, feeding, grounds, for, loggerhead, sea, turtles, in, europe, the, alboran, sea, also, hosts, important, commercial, fisheries, including, sardines, and, swordfish, the, mediterranean, monk, seals, live, in, the, aegean, sea, in, greece, in, 2003, the, world, wildlife, fund, raised, concerns, about, the, widespread, drift, net, fishing, endangering, populations, of, dolphins, turtles, and, other, marine, animals, such, as, the, spiny, squat, lobster, there, was, a, resident, population, of, orcas, in, the, mediterranean, until, the, 1980s, when, they, went, extinct, probably, due, to, long, term, pcb, exposure, there, are, still, annual, sightings, of, orca, vagrants, for, 4, 000, years, human, activity, has, transformed, most, parts, of, mediterranean, europe, and, the, humanisation, of, the, landscape, overlapped, with, the, appearance, of, the, present, mediterranean, climate, the, image, of, a, simplistic, environmental, determinist, notion, of, a, mediterranean, paradise, on, earth, in, antiquity, which, was, destroyed, by, later, civilisations, dates, back, to, at, least, the, 18th, century, and, was, for, centuries, fashionable, in, archaeological, and, historical, circles, based, on, a, broad, variety, of, methods, e, g, historical, documents, analysis, of, trade, relations, floodplain, sediments, pollen, tree, ring, and, further, archaeometric, analyses, and, population, studies, alfred, thomas, grove, s, and, oliver, rackham, s, work, on, the, nature, of, mediterranean, europe, challenges, this, common, wisdom, of, a, mediterranean, europe, as, a, lost, eden, a, formerly, fertile, and, forested, region, that, had, been, progressively, degraded, and, desertified, by, human, mismanagement, the, belief, stems, more, from, the, failure, of, the, recent, landscape, to, measure, up, to, the, imaginary, past, of, the, classics, as, idealised, by, artists, poets, and, scientists, of, the, early, modern, enlightenment, the, historical, evolution, of, climate, vegetation, and, landscape, in, southern, europe, from, prehistoric, times, to, the, present, is, much, more, complex, and, underwent, various, changes, for, example, some, of, the, deforestation, had, already, taken, place, before, the, roman, age, while, in, the, roman, age, large, enterprises, such, as, the, latifundia, took, effective, care, of, forests, and, agriculture, the, largest, depopulation, effects, came, with, the, end, of, the, empire, some, assume, that, the, major, deforestation, took, place, in, modern, times, the, later, usage, patterns, were, also, quite, different, e, g, in, southern, and, northern, italy, also, the, climate, has, usually, been, unstable, and, there, is, evidence, of, various, ancient, and, modern, little, ice, ages, and, plant, cover, accommodated, to, various, extremes, and, became, resilient, to, various, patterns, of, human, activity, even, grove, considered, that, human, activity, could, be, the, cause, of, climate, change, modern, science, has, been, able, to, provide, clear, evidence, of, this, the, wide, ecological, diversity, typical, of, mediterranean, europe, is, predominantly, based, on, human, behaviour, as, it, is, and, has, been, closely, related, to, human, usage, patterns, the, diversity, range, was, enhanced, by, the, widespread, exchange, and, interaction, of, the, longstanding, and, highly, diverse, local, agriculture, intense, transport, and, trade, relations, and, the, interaction, with, settlements, pasture, and, other, land, use, the, greatest, human, induced, changes, however, came, after, world, war, ii, in, line, with, the, 1950s, syndrome, as, rural, populations, throughout, the, region, abandoned, traditional, subsistence, economies, grove, and, rackham, suggest, that, the, locals, left, the, traditional, agricultural, patterns, and, instead, became, scenery, setting, agents, for, tourism, this, resulted, in, more, uniform, large, scale, formations, among, further, current, important, threats, to, mediterranean, landscapes, are, overdevelopment, of, coastal, areas, abandonment, of, mountains, and, as, mentioned, the, loss, of, variety, via, the, reduction, of, traditional, agricultural, occupations, the, region, has, a, variety, of, geological, hazards, which, have, closely, interacted, with, human, activity, and, land, use, patterns, among, others, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, thera, eruption, dated, to, the, 17th, or, 16th, century, bc, caused, a, large, tsunami, that, some, experts, hypothesise, devastated, the, minoan, civilisation, on, the, nearby, island, of, crete, further, leading, some, to, believe, that, this, may, have, been, the, catastrophe, that, inspired, the, atlantis, legend, mount, vesuvius, is, the, only, active, volcano, on, the, european, mainland, while, others, mount, etna, and, stromboli, are, on, neighbouring, islands, the, region, around, vesuvius, including, the, phlegraean, fields, caldera, west, of, naples, is, quite, active, and, constitute, the, most, densely, populated, volcanic, region, in, the, world, where, an, eruptive, event, may, occur, within, decades, vesuvius, itself, is, regarded, as, quite, dangerous, due, to, a, tendency, towards, explosive, plinian, eruptions, it, is, best, known, for, its, eruption, in, ad, 79, that, led, to, the, burying, and, destruction, of, the, roman, cities, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, the, large, experience, of, member, states, and, regional, authorities, has, led, to, exchange, on, the, international, level, with, the, cooperation, of, ngos, states, regional, and, municipality, authorities, and, private, persons, the, greek, turkish, earthquake, diplomacy, is, a, quite, positive, example, of, natural, hazards, leading, to, improved, relations, between, traditional, rivals, in, the, region, after, earthquakes, in, zmit, and, athens, in, 1999, the, european, union, solidarity, fund, eusf, was, set, up, to, respond, to, major, natural, disasters, and, express, european, solidarity, to, disaster, stricken, regions, within, all, of, europe, the, largest, amount, of, funding, requests, in, the, eu, relates, to, forest, fires, followed, by, floods, and, earthquakes, forest, fires, whether, human, made, or, natural, are, a, frequent, and, dangerous, hazard, in, the, mediterranean, region, tsunamis, are, also, an, often, underestimated, hazard, in, the, region, for, example, the, 1908, messina, earthquake, and, tsunami, took, more, than, 123, 000, lives, in, sicily, and, calabria, and, were, among, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, modern, europe, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, created, the, first, salt, water, passage, between, the, mediterranean, and, the, red, sea, the, red, sea, is, higher, than, the, eastern, mediterranean, so, the, canal, functions, as, a, tidal, strait, that, pours, red, sea, water, into, the, mediterranean, the, bitter, lakes, which, are, hyper, saline, natural, lakes, that, form, part, of, the, canal, blocked, the, migration, of, red, sea, species, into, the, mediterranean, for, many, decades, but, as, the, salinity, of, the, lakes, gradually, equalised, with, that, of, the, red, sea, the, barrier, to, migration, was, removed, and, plants, and, animals, from, the, red, sea, have, begun, to, colonise, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, red, sea, is, generally, saltier, and, more, nutrient, poor, than, the, atlantic, so, the, red, sea, species, have, advantages, over, atlantic, species, in, the, salty, and, nutrient, poor, eastern, mediterranean, accordingly, red, sea, species, invade, the, mediterranean, biota, and, not, vice, versa, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, lessepsian, migration, after, ferdinand, de, lesseps, the, french, engineer, or, erythrean, red, invasion, the, construction, of, the, aswan, high, dam, across, the, nile, river, in, the, 1960s, reduced, the, inflow, of, freshwater, and, nutrient, rich, silt, from, the, nile, into, the, eastern, mediterranean, making, conditions, there, even, more, like, the, red, sea, and, worsening, the, impact, of, the, invasive, species, invasive, species, have, become, a, major, component, of, the, mediterranean, ecosystem, and, have, serious, impacts, on, the, mediterranean, ecology, endangering, a, number, of, local, and, endemic, mediterranean, species, a, first, look, at, some, groups, of, marine, species, shows, that, over, 70, of, exotic, decapods, and, some, 2, 3, of, exotic, fishes, found, in, the, mediterranean, are, of, indo, pacific, origin, introduced, from, the, red, sea, via, the, suez, canal, this, makes, the, canal, the, first, pathway, of, arrival, of, alien, species, into, the, mediterranean, the, impacts, of, some, lessepsian, species, have, proven, to, be, considerable, mainly, in, the, levantine, basin, of, the, mediterranean, where, they, are, replacing, native, species, and, becoming, a, familiar, sight, according, to, definitions, by, the, mediterranean, science, commission, and, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, and, to, convention, on, biological, diversity, cbd, and, ramsar, convention, terminologies, they, are, alien, species, as, they, are, non, native, non, indigenous, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, are, found, outside, their, normal, non, adjacent, area, of, distribution, when, these, species, succeed, in, establishing, populations, in, the, mediterranean, sea, compete, with, and, begin, to, replace, native, species, they, are, alien, invasive, species, as, they, are, an, agent, of, change, and, a, threat, to, the, native, biodiversity, in, the, context, of, cbd, introduction, refers, to, the, movement, by, human, agency, indirect, or, direct, of, an, alien, species, outside, of, its, natural, range, past, or, present, the, suez, canal, being, an, artificial, human, made, canal, is, a, human, agency, lessepsian, migrants, are, therefore, introduced, species, indirect, and, unintentional, whatever, wording, is, chosen, they, represent, a, threat, to, the, native, mediterranean, biodiversity, because, they, are, non, indigenous, to, this, sea, in, recent, years, the, egyptian, government, s, announcement, of, its, intentions, to, deepen, and, widen, the, canal, raised, concerns, from, marine, biologists, fearing, that, such, an, act, will, only, worsen, the, invasion, of, red, sea, species, into, the, mediterranean, and, lead, to, even, more, species, passing, through, the, canal, in, recent, decades, the, arrival, of, exotic, species, from, the, tropical, atlantic, has, become, noticeable, in, many, cases, this, reflects, an, expansion, favoured, by, a, warming, trend, of, sub, tropical, atlantic, waters, and, also, by, a, fast, growing, maritime, traffic, of, the, natural, range, of, species, that, now, enter, the, mediterranean, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, while, not, as, intense, as, lessepsian, migration, the, process, is, of, importance, and, is, therefore, receiving, increased, levels, of, scientific, coverage, by, 2100, the, overall, level, of, the, mediterranean, could, rise, between, 3, and, 61, cm, 1, 2, and, 24, 0, in, as, a, result, of, the, effects, of, climate, change, this, could, have, adverse, effects, on, populations, across, the, mediterranean, coastal, ecosystems, also, appear, to, be, threatened, by, sea, level, rise, especially, enclosed, seas, such, as, the, baltic, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, these, seas, have, only, small, and, primarily, east, west, movement, corridors, which, may, restrict, northward, displacement, of, organisms, in, these, areas, sea, level, rise, for, the, next, century, 2100, could, be, between, 30, and, 100, cm, 12, and, 39, in, and, temperature, shifts, of, a, mere, 0, 05, 0, 1, c, 0, 09, 0, 18, f, in, the, deep, sea, are, sufficient, to, induce, significant, changes, in, species, richness, and, functional, diversity, pollution, in, this, region, has, been, extremely, high, in, recent, years, the, united, nations, environment, programme, has, estimated, that, 650, 000, 000, t, 720, 000, 000, short, tons, of, sewage, 129, 000, t, 142, 000, short, tons, of, mineral, oil, 60, 000, t, 66, 000, short, tons, of, mercury, 3, 800, t, 4, 200, short, tons, of, lead, and, 36, 000, t, 40, 000, short, tons, of, phosphates, are, dumped, into, the, mediterranean, each, year, the, barcelona, convention, aims, to, reduce, pollution, in, the, mediterranean, sea, and, protect, and, improve, the, marine, environment, in, the, area, thereby, contributing, to, its, sustainable, development, many, marine, species, have, been, almost, wiped, out, because, of, the, sea, s, pollution, one, of, them, is, the, mediterranean, monk, seal, which, is, considered, to, be, among, the, world, s, most, endangered, marine, mammals, the, mediterranean, is, also, plagued, by, marine, debris, a, 1994, study, of, the, seabed, using, trawl, nets, around, the, coasts, of, spain, france, and, italy, reported, a, particularly, high, mean, concentration, of, debris, an, average, of, 1, 935, items, per, km, 2, 5, 010, sq, mi, some, of, the, world, s, busiest, shipping, routes, are, in, the, mediterranean, sea, in, particular, the, maritime, silk, road, from, asia, and, africa, leads, through, the, suez, canal, directly, into, the, mediterranean, sea, to, its, deep, water, ports, in, valencia, piraeus, trieste, genoa, marseilles, and, barcelona, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, 220, 000, merchant, vessels, of, more, than, 100, tonnes, cross, the, mediterranean, sea, each, year, about, one, third, of, the, world, s, total, merchant, shipping, these, ships, often, carry, hazardous, cargo, which, if, lost, would, result, in, severe, damage, to, the, marine, environment, the, discharge, of, chemical, tank, washings, and, oily, wastes, also, represent, a, significant, source, of, marine, pollution, the, mediterranean, sea, constitutes, 0, 7, of, the, global, water, surface, and, yet, receives, 17, of, global, marine, oil, pollution, it, is, estimated, that, every, year, between, 100, 000, and, 150, 000, t, 98, 000, and, 148, 000, long, tons, of, crude, oil, are, deliberately, released, into, the, sea, from, shipping, activities, approximately, 370, 000, 000, t, 360, 000, 000, long, tons, of, oil, are, transported, annually, in, the, mediterranean, sea, more, than, 20, of, the, world, total, with, around, 250, 300, oil, tankers, crossing, the, sea, every, day, an, important, destination, is, the, port, of, trieste, the, starting, point, of, the, transalpine, pipeline, which, covers, 40, of, germany, s, oil, demand, 100, of, the, federal, states, of, bavaria, and, baden, w, rttemberg, 90, of, austria, and, 50, of, the, czech, republic, accidental, oil, spills, happen, frequently, with, an, average, of, 10, spills, per, year, a, major, oil, spill, could, occur, at, any, time, in, any, part, of, the, mediterranean, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, has, been, used, for, tourism, since, ancient, times, as, the, roman, villa, buildings, on, the, amalfi, coast, or, in, barcola, show, from, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, particular, the, beaches, became, places, of, longing, for, many, europeans, and, travellers, from, then, on, and, especially, after, world, war, ii, mass, tourism, to, the, mediterranean, began, with, all, its, advantages, and, disadvantages, while, initially, the, journey, was, by, train, and, later, by, bus, or, car, today, the, plane, is, increasingly, used, tourism, is, today, one, of, the, most, important, sources, of, income, for, many, mediterranean, countries, despite, the, human, made, geopolitical, conflicts, in, the, region, the, countries, have, tried, to, extinguish, rising, human, made, chaotic, zones, that, might, affect, the, region, s, economies, and, societies, in, neighbouring, coastal, countries, and, shipping, routes, naval, and, rescue, components, in, the, mediterranean, sea, are, considered, to, be, among, the, best, due, to, the, rapid, cooperation, between, various, naval, fleets, unlike, the, vast, open, oceans, the, sea, s, closed, position, facilitates, effective, naval, and, rescue, missions, considered, the, safest, and, regardless, of, any, human, made, or, natural, disaster, tourism, is, a, source, of, income, for, small, coastal, communities, including, islands, independent, of, urban, centres, however, tourism, has, also, played, a, major, role, in, the, degradation, of, the, coastal, and, marine, environment, rapid, development, has, been, encouraged, by, mediterranean, governments, to, support, the, large, numbers, of, tourists, visiting, the, region, but, this, has, caused, serious, disturbance, to, marine, habitats, by, erosion, and, pollution, in, many, places, along, the, mediterranean, coasts, tourism, often, concentrates, in, areas, of, high, natural, wealth, causing, a, serious, threat, to, the, habitats, of, endangered, species, such, as, sea, turtles, and, monk, seals, reductions, in, natural, wealth, may, reduce, the, incentive, for, tourists, to, visit, fish, stock, levels, in, the, mediterranean, sea, are, alarmingly, low, the, european, environment, agency, says, that, more, than, 65, of, all, fish, stocks, in, the, region, are, outside, safe, biological, limits, and, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organisation, that, some, of, the, most, important, fisheries, such, as, albacore, and, bluefin, tuna, hake, marlin, swordfish, red, mullet, and, sea, bream, are, threatened, there, are, clear, indications, that, catch, size, and, quality, have, declined, often, dramatically, and, in, many, areas, larger, and, longer, lived, species, have, disappeared, entirely, from, commercial, catches, large, open, water, fish, like, tuna, have, been, a, shared, fisheries, resource, for, thousands, of, years, but, the, stocks, are, now, dangerously, low, in, 1999, greenpeace, published, a, report, revealing, that, the, amount, of, bluefin, tuna, in, the, mediterranean, had, decreased, by, over, 80, in, the, previous, 20, years, and, government, scientists, warn, that, without, immediate, action, the, stock, will, collapse, a, study, showed, that, climate, change, related, exceptional, marine, heatwaves, in, the, mediterranean, sea, during, 2015, 2019, resulted, in, widespread, mass, sealife, die, offs, in, five, consecutive, years
