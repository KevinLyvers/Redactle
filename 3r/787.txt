word, is, sometimes, rendered, with, the, nasalised, vowels, as, g, or, g, g, historian, carl, christian, reindorf, confirmed, this, etymology, proposing, a, link, between, the, martial, qualities, and, migratory, behaviour, of, the, local, ants, and, those, of, the, ga, people, the, link, between, the, ethnonym, and, ants, was, explicitly, reflected, in, the, recognition, of, anthills, as,

gave, its, name, to, the, ga, districts, surrounding, accra, the, spelling, accra, was, given, to, nkran, by, europeans, an, earlier, spelling, used, by, the, danes, was, akra, the, main, ga, group, known, as, the, tumgwa, were, led, by, ayi, kushie, arrived, by, sea, when, the, guan, lartehs, on, the, coast, saw, them, on, their, canoes, at, sea, they, looked, like, ants, hence, the, lartehs, refer, to, them, as, nkran, ants, nkran, was, later, corrupted, by, the, danes, to, akra, then, to, present, day, accra, nkran, in, the, ga, language, is, gaga, thus, they, also, started, calling, themselves, ga, due, to, the, sheer, numbers, of, the, ga, immigrants, the, indigenous, lartehs, relocated, to, the, akuapem, ridge, initially, accra, was, not, the, most, prominent, trading, centre, the, trade, hubs, of, the, time, were, the, ports, at, ada, and, prampram, along, with, the, inland, centres, of, dodowa, and, akuse, the, dutch, built, the, nearby, outposts, of, ussher, fort, while, the, british, and, the, swedes, built, james, fort, and, christiansborg, castles, respectively, by, the, 17th, century, portugal, france, and, denmark, had, constructed, forts, in, the, city, britain, gradually, acquired, the, interests, of, all, other, countries, beginning, in, 1851, when, denmark, sold, christiansborg, which, they, had, acquired, from, the, swedes, and, their, other, forts, to, the, british, the, netherlands, was, the, last, to, sell, out, in, 1871, in, 1873, after, decades, of, tension, between, the, british, and, ashantis, the, british, captured, kumasi, destroying, portions, of, the, city, the, british, then, captured, accra, in, 1874, and, in, 1877, at, the, end, of, the, second, anglo, asante, war, accra, replaced, cape, coast, as, the, capital, of, the, british, gold, coast, this, decision, was, made, because, accra, had, a, drier, climate, relative, to, cape, coast, until, this, time, the, settlement, of, accra, was, confined, between, ussher, fort, to, the, east, and, the, korle, lagoon, to, the, west, as, the, newly, established, gold, coast, s, administrative, functions, were, moved, to, accra, 1877, an, influx, of, british, colonial, administrators, and, european, settlers, grew, around, the, christiansborg, modern, osu, ministries, ridge, labone, and, cantonments, began, and, the, city, began, to, expand, to, accommodate, the, new, residents, victoriaborg, was, formed, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, an, exclusively, european, residential, neighbourhood, located, to, the, east, of, the, city, limits, of, the, time, the, boundaries, of, accra, were, further, stretched, in, 1908, this, expansion, entailed, the, creation, of, a, native, only, neighbourhood, intended, to, accommodate, members, of, the, native, population, as, a, means, of, relieving, congestion, problems, in, the, overcrowded, city, centre, adabraka, was, thus, established, to, the, north, of, the, city, one, of, the, most, influential, decisions, in, the, history, of, the, city, was, that, of, building, the, accra, kumasi, railway, in, 1908, this, was, to, connect, accra, the, country, s, foremost, port, at, that, time, with, ghana, s, main, cocoa, producing, regions, in, 1923, the, railway, was, completed, and, by, 1924, cocoa, was, ghana, s, largest, export, the, colonial, era, heavily, influenced, the, shape, that, accra, took, during, this, period, for, example, the, segregation, of, european, and, african, neighbourhoods, was, mandated, by, law, until, 1923, and, all, new, buildings, were, required, to, be, built, out, of, stone, or, concrete, despite, these, regulations, european, settlers, in, the, gold, coast, were, very, hesitant, to, invest, any, large, amount, of, money, into, the, city, to, maintain, its, infrastructure, or, improve, public, works, this, did, not, change, until, the, governorship, of, sir, frederick, gordon, guggisberg, during, which, period, the, three, separate, settlements, osu, la, and, jamestown, merged, to, become, modern, accra, guggisberg, s, administration, laid, out, the, present, grid, networked, neighbourhoods, of, tudu, adabraka, and, asylum, down, among, the, achievements, of, guggisberg, was, the, building, of, a, bridge, across, the, korle, lagoon, in, 1923, which, opened, the, land, west, of, the, lagoon, for, settlement, guggisberg, also, oversaw, the, building, of, a, major, hospital, korle, bu, and, secondary, school, achimota, such, improvements, led, to, an, increase, in, accra, s, population, due, to, the, migration, of, rural, dwellers, into, the, city, and, the, immigration, of, increasing, numbers, of, british, businessmen, and, administrators, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, the, neighbourhoods, of, ridge, and, cantonments, were, planned, as, low, density, developments, for, europeans, while, many, rural, migrants, settled, in, neighbourhoods, which, had, not, yet, been, incorporated, into, accra, s, municipal, boundary, such, as, nima, and, surrounding, areas, thus, the, development, of, these, neighbourhoods, was, unregulated, by, the, government, creating, a, crowded, and, jumbled, shanty, town, landscape, another, area, of, accra, that, took, shape, at, this, time, was, the, central, business, district, cbd, more, administrative, buildings, were, built, on, high, street, forming, a, massive, judicial, administrative, complex, additionally, the, expansion, of, the, economy, led, to, many, more, commercial, buildings, being, built, in, the, cbd, in, 1944, accra, s, city, planner, maxwell, fry, devised, a, town, plan, which, was, revised, in, 1958, by, b, d, w, treavallion, and, alan, flood, although, the, fry, trevallion, plan, was, never, followed, through, it, illustrated, the, british, vision, of, how, accra, should, develop, in, 1948, ghana, remained, a, colony, of, great, britain, following, world, war, ii, the, chief, of, osu, alata, nii, kobina, bonney, iii, had, set, up, a, boycott, of, european, goods, across, the, country, due, to, the, rise, of, prices, for, essential, commodities, at, the, same, time, veterans, of, the, war, were, fighting, for, their, benefits, and, promised, pay, unarmed, ex, servicemen, organized, a, march, on, christiansborg, castle, accra, on, february, 28, 1948, their, plan, was, to, hand, a, petition, to, the, colonial, governor, demanding, they, receive, their, pay, and, benefits, before, reaching, the, castle, the, veterans, were, fired, upon, after, being, ordered, by, the, colonial, police, chief, to, disperse, three, of, the, leaders, of, the, demonstration, were, killed, including, sergeant, nii, adjetey, who, now, has, a, memorial, in, accra, in, the, fry, treavallion, plan, a, reorganization, of, the, cbd, was, called, for, as, well, as, the, development, of, the, coastal, region, of, the, city, to, reorganize, the, cbd, the, planners, decided, to, superimpose, a, tight, street, grid, north, of, fort, ussher, to, the, east, of, this, newly, organized, cbd, the, planners, hoped, to, preserve, a, broad, open, space, for, a, restaurant, country, club, and, polo, and, cricket, fields, additionally, the, british,

centre, lastly, the, fry, treavallion, plan, included, plans, to, make, the, coastal, region, an, extension, of, the, exclusive, european, neighbourhood, of, victoriaborg, and, to, create, a, recreational, preserve, for, the, elite, however, the, british, gold, coast, ended, before, the, fry, treavallion, plan, was, enacted, when, kwame, nkrumah, became, ghana, s, first, post, independence, prime, minister, in, 1957, he, created, his, own, plan, for, accra, s, development, instead, of, creating, spaces, to, serve, the, elite, nkrumah, sought, to, create, spaces, to, inspire, pride, and, nationalism, in, his, people, and, people, throughout, africa, rather, than, creating, ornamental, fountains, and, a, large, parliament, complex, nkrumah, decided, to, build, landmarks, such, as, independence, square, the, state, house, and, the, organisation, of, african, unity, building, and, to, refurbish, christianborg, castle, nkrumah, decided, to, leave, the, atlantic, coastal, region, undeveloped, so, as, to, not, detract, attention, from, the, community, centre, or, independence, square, lending, both, spaces, symbolic, significance, the, nkrumah, plan, did, not, emphasise, order, nearly, as, much, as, the, fry, treavallion, plan, did, whereas, the, british, plan, strove, to, lessen, crowding, in, the, commercial, district, and, help, relieve, the,

growth, rate, the, stagnation, of, the, ghanaian, economy, during, the, 1970s, slowed, the, growth, of, accra, s, population, as, shown, by, the, falling, growth, rate, of, the, 1970, 1984,
