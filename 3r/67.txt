the, tasman, sea, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, south, pacific, ocean, situated, between, australia, and, new, zealand, it, measures, about, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, across, and, about, 2, 800, km, 1, 700, mi, from, north, to, south, the, sea, was, named, after, the, dutch, explorer, abel, janszoon, tasman, who, in, 1642, was, the, first, known, person, to, cross, it, british, explorer, lieutenant, james, cook, later, extensively, navigated, the, tasman, sea, in, the, 1770s, during, his, three, voyages, of, exploration, the, tasman, sea, is, informally, referred, to, in, both, australian, and, new, zealand, english, as, the, ditch, for, example, crossing, the, ditch, means, travelling, to, australia, from, new, zealand, or, vice, versa, the, diminutive, term, the, ditch, used, for, the, tasman, sea, is, comparable, to, referring, to, the, north, atlantic, ocean, as, the, pond, the, south, of, the, sea, is, passed, over, by, depressions, going, from, west, to, east, the, northern, limit, of, these, westerly, winds, is, near, to, 40, s, during, the, southern, winter, from, april, to, october, the, northern, branch, of, these, winds, from, the, west, changes, its, direction, toward, the, north, and, goes, up, against, trade, winds, hence, the, sea, receives, frequent, winds, from, the, southwest, during, this, period, in, the, australian, summer, from, november, to, march, the, southern, branch, of, the, trade, winds, goes, up, against, west, winds, and, produces, further, wind, activity, in, the, area, the, tasman, sea, is, 2, 250, km, 1, 400, mi, wide, and, has, an, area, of, 2, 300, 000, km, 2, 890, 000, sq, mi, the, maximum, depth, of, the, sea, is, 5, 943, m, 19, 498, ft, the, base, of, the, sea, is, made, up, of, globigerina, ooze, a, small, zone, of, pteropod, ooze, is, found, to, the, south, of, new, caledonia, and, to, the, southern, extent, of, 30, s, siliceous, ooze, can, be, found, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, tasman, sea, as, on, the, west, a, line, from, gabo, island, near, cape, howe, 37, 30, s, to, the, northeast, point, of, east, sister, island, 148, e, thence, along, the, 148th, meridian, to, flinders, island, beyond, this, island, a, line, running, to, the, eastward, of, the, vansittart, shoals, to, barren, island, and, from, cape, barren, the, easternmost, point, of, barren, island, to, eddystone, point, 41, s, in, tasmania, thence, along, the, east, coast, to, south, east, cape, the, southern, point, of, tasmania, on, the, north, the, parallel, of, 30, s, from, the, australian, coast, eastward, as, far, as, a, line, joining, the, east, extremities, of, elizabeth, reef, and, south, east, rock, 31, 47, s, 159, 18, e, 31, 783, s, 159, 300, e, 31, 783, 159, 300, then, to, the, southward, along, this, line, to, the, south, east, rock, on, the, northeast, from, the, south, east, rock, to, the, north, point, of, three, kings, islands, 34, 10, s, 172, 10, e, 34,

48, s, 166, 30, e, to, north, west, cape, auckland, island, 50, 30, s, 166, 10, e, 50, 500, s, 166, 167, e, 50, 500, 166, 167, through, this, island, to, its, southern, point, on, the, south, a, line, joining, the, southern, point, of, auckland, island, 50, 55, s, 166, 0, e, 50, 917, s, 166, 000, e, 50, 917, 166, 000, to, south, east, cape, the, southern, point, of, tasmania, the, tasman, sea, s, midocean, ridge, developed, between, 85, and, 55, million, years, ago, as, australia, and, zealandia, broke, apart, during, the, breakup, of, supercontinent, gondwana, it, lies, roughly, midway, between, the, continental, margins, of, australia, and, zealandia, much, of, zealandia, is, submerged, so, the, ridge, runs, much, closer, to, the, australian, coast, than, new, zealand, s, the, tasman, sea, features, a, number, of, midsea, island, groups, quite, apart, from, coastal, islands, located, near, the, australian, and, new, zealand, mainlands, the, east, australian, current, that, commences, its, flow, southwards, in, the, tropics, of, the, coral, sea, near, the, eastern, coast, of, australia, is, the, most, energetic, circulation, feature, in, the, south, western, pacific, ocean, and, is, a, primary, means, of, heat, transport, from, the, tropics, to, the, middle, latitudes, between, australia, and, new, zealand, 1458, the, east, australian, current, is, a, return, of, the, westward, flowing, pacific, equatorial, current, pacific, south, equatorial, current, at, the, juncture, between, the, tasman, and, coral, seas, while, the, east, australian, current, continues, south, in, the, western, tasman, a, branch, flows, east, called, the, tasman, front, towards, the, north, of, new, zealand, with, most, continuing, eastward, above, new, zealand, into, the, south, pacific, ocean, it, transpires, that, while, predominantly, the, location, of, westerly, wind, stress, is, a, factor, in, how, far, north, the, formation, of, the, tasman, front, occurs, so, is, the, presence, of, the, new, zealand, land, mass, as, the, top, of, new, zealand, defines, the, furtherest, south, that, the, tasman, front, can, be, split, off, by, the, westerly, winds, 1457, 1467, 8, a, boundary, current, called, the, east, auckland, current, goes, down, the, west, coast, of, the, north, island, and, further, south, the, east, cape, current, that, has, been, diverted, towards, the, south, island, by, the, shapes, of, the, lord, howe, rise, and, southern, east, coast, of, the, north, island, continues, to, the, south, 1458, the, east, australian, current, south, of, tasmania, also, is, diverted, west, in, the, subtropical, front, which, collides, with, the, western, moving, subantarctic, front, of, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, the, east, australian, current, sheds, eddies, on, its, way, south, that, move, south, westward, with, some, known, as, the, tasman, leakage, making, it, as, far, westward, as, the, indian, ocean, 1458, a, deep, sea, research, ship, the, rv, tangaroa, explored, the, sea, and, found, 500, species, of, fish, and, 1300, species, of, invertebrates, the, tooth, of, a, megalodon, an, extinct, shark, was, also, found, by, researchers, in, 1876, the, first, telegraph, cable, connecting, australia, and, new, zealand, was, laid, in, the, tasman, sea, the, telegraph, cable, was, made, obsolete, in, 1963, when, the, commonwealth, pacific, cable, new, zealand, s, first, international, telephone, cable, was, completed, moncrieff, and, hood, were, the, first, to, attempt, a, trans, tasman, crossing, by, plane, in, january, 1928, the, aviators, were, never, seen, or, heard, of, again, the, first, successful, flight, over, the, sea, was, accomplished, by, charles, kingsford, smith, and, charles, ulm, later, that, year, the, first, person, to, row, solo, across, the, sea, was, colin, quincey, in, 1977, the, next, successful, solo, crossing, was, completed, by, his, son, shaun, quincey, in, 2010
