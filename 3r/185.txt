the, loire, l, w, r, lwar, us, also, l, u, r, loo, ar, french, occitan, l, ger, arpitan, l, re, breton, liger, latin, liger, is, the, longest, river, in, france, and, the, 171st, longest, in, the, world, with, a, length, of, 1, 006, kilometres, 625, mi, it, drains, 117, 054, km, 2, 45, 195, sq, mi, more, than, a, fifth, of, france, s, land, while, its, average, discharge, is, only, half, that, of, the, rh, ne, it, rises, in, the, southeastern, quarter, of, the, french, massif, central, in, the, c, vennes, range, in, the, department, of, ard, che, at, 1, 350, m, 4, 430, ft, near, mont, gerbier, de, jonc, it, flows, north, through, nevers, to, orl, ans, then, west, through, tours, and, nantes, until, it, reaches, the, bay, of, biscay, atlantic, ocean, at, saint, nazaire, its, main, tributaries, include, the, rivers, ni, vre, maine, and, the, erdre, on, its, right, bank, and, the, rivers, allier, cher, indre, vienne, and, the, s, vre, nantaise, on, the, left, bank, the, loire, gives, its, name, to, six, departments, loire, haute, loire, loire, atlantique, indre, et, loire, maine, et, loire, and, sa, ne, et, loire, the, lower, central, swathe, of, its, valley, straddling, the, pays, de, la, loire, and, centre, val, de, loire, regions, was, added, to, the, world, heritage, sites, list, of, unesco, on, december, 2, 2000, vineyards, and, ch, teaux, are, found, along, the, banks, of, the, river, throughout, this, section, and, are, a, major, tourist, attraction, the, human, history, of, the, loire, river, valley, is, thought, by, some, to, begin, with, the, middle, palaeolithic, period, of, 90, 40, kya, thousand, years, ago, followed, by, modern, humans, about, 30, kya, succeeded, by, the, neolithic, period, 6, 000, to, 4, 500, bc, all, of, the, recent, stone, age, in, europe, then, came, the, gauls, the, local, tribes, during, the, iron, age, period, of, 1500, to, 500, bc, they, used, the, loire, as, a, key, trading, route, by, 600, bc, using, pack, horses, to, link, its, trade, such, as, the, metals, of, the, armorican, massif, with, phoenicia, and, ancient, greece, via, lyon, on, the, rh, ne, gallic, rule, ended, in, the, valley, in, 56, bc, when, julius, caesar, conquered, the, adjacent, provinces, for, rome, christianity, was, introduced, into, this, valley, from, the, 3rd, century, ad, as, missionaries, many, later, recognized, as, saints, converted, the, pagans, in, this, period, settlers, established, vineyards, and, began, producing, wines, the, loire, valley, has, been, called, the, garden, of, france, and, is, studded, with, over, a, thousand, ch, teaux, each, with, distinct, architectural, embellishments, covering, a, wide, range, of, variations, from, the, early, medieval, to, the, late, renaissance, periods, they, were, originally, created, as, feudal, strongholds, over, centuries, past, in, the, strategic, divide, between, southern, and, northern, france, now, many, are, privately, owned, the, name, loire, comes, from, latin, liger, which, is, itself, a, transcription, of, the, native, gaulish, celtic, name, of, the, river, the, gaulish, name, comes, from, the, gaulish, word, liga, which, means, silt, sediment, deposit, alluvium, a, word, that, gave, french, lie, as, in, sur, lie, which, in, turn, gave, english, lees, liga, comes, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, leg, meaning, to, lie, lay, as, in, the, welsh, word, lleyg, and, also, which, gave, many, words, in, english, such, as, to, lie, to, lay, ledge, law, etc, the, source, of, the, river, lies, in, the, eastern, massif, central, in, springs, to, the, south, side, of, mont, gerbier, de, jonc, at, 44, 50, 38, n, 4, 13, 12, e, 44, 84389, n, 4, 22000, e, 44, 84389, 4, 22000, this, lies, in, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, southern, c, vennes, highlands, in, the, ard, che, commune, of, sainte, eulalie, of, southeastern, france, it, is, originally, a, mere, trickle, of, water, located, at, 1, 408, m, 4, 619, ft, above, sea, level, the, presence, of, an, aquifer, under, mont, gerbier, de, jonc, gives, rise, to, multiple, sources, three, of, them, located, at, the, foot, of, mount, have, been, highlighted, as, river, sources, the, three, streams, converge, to, form, the, loire, which, descends, the, valley, south, of, mount, through, the, village, of, sainte, eulalie, itself, the, loire, changed, its, course, due, to, tectonic, deformations, from, the, original, outfall, into, the, english, channel, to, its, new, outfall, into, the, atlantic, ocean, thereby, forming, today, s, narrow, terrain, of, gorges, the, loire, valley, with, alluvium, formations, and, the, long, stretch, of, beaches, along, the, atlantic, ocean, the, river, can, be, divided, into, three, main, zones, in, the, upper, basin, the, river, flows, through, a, narrow, incised, valley, marked, by, gorges, and, forests, on, the, edges, and, a, distinct, low, population, in, the, intermediate, section, the, alluvial, plain, broadens, and, the, river, meanders, and, forks, into, multiple, channels, river, flow, is, particularly, high, in, the, river, area, near, roanne, and, vichy, up, to, the, confluence, with, the, allier, in, the, middle, section, of, the, river, in, the, loire, valley, numerous, dikes, built, between, the, 12th, and, 19th, century, exist, providing, mitigation, against, flooding, in, this, section, the, river, is, relatively, straight, except, for, the, area, near, orl, ans, and, numerous, sand, banks, and, islands, exist, the, lower, course, of, the, river, is, characterized, by, wetlands, and, fens, which, are, of, major, importance, to, conservation, given, that, they, form, unique, habitats, for, migratory, birds, the, loire, flows, roughly, northward, through, roanne, and, nevers, to, orl, ans, and, thereafter, westward, through, tours, to, nantes, where, it, forms, an, estuary, it, flows, into, the, atlantic, ocean, at, 47, 16, 44, n, 2, 10, 19, w, 47, 27889, n, 2,

after, the, loire, the, loire, flows, through, the, following, d, partements, and, towns, the, loire, valley, in, the, loire, river, basin, is, a, 300, km, 190, mi, stretch, in, the, western, reach, of, the, river, starting, with, orl, ans, and, terminating, at, nantes, 56, km, 35, mi, short, of, the, loire, estuary, and, the, atlantic, ocean, the, tidal, stretch, of, the, river, extends, to, a, length, of, 60, km, 37, mi, and, a, width, of, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, which, has, oil, refineries, the, port, of, saint, nazaire, and, 40, 000, hectares, 99, 000, acres, of, wetland, whose, formation, is, dated, to, 7500, bc, caused, by, inundation, by, sea, waters, on, the, northern, bank, of, the, estuary, and, the, beaches, of, le, croisic, and, la, baule, along, the, coastline, its, main, tributaries, include, the, rivers, maine, ni, vre, and, the, erdre, on, its, right, bank, and, the, rivers, allier, cher, indre, vienne, and, the, s, vre, nantaise, on, the, left, bank, the, largest, tributary, of, the, river, is, the, allier, 410, km, 250, mi, in, length, which, joins, the, loire, near, the, town, of, nevers, at, 46, 57, 34, n, 3, 4, 44, e, 46, 95944, n, 3, 07889, e, 46, 95944,

basement, domain, and, the, domain, of, sedimentary, formations, the, basement, domain, primarily, consists, of, metamorphic, and, siliceous, fragmented, rocks, with, groundwater, occurring, in, fissures, the, sedimentary, domain, consists, of, limestone, and, carbonaceous, rocks, that, where, saturated, form, productive, aquifers, rock, outcrops, of, granite, or, basalt, also, are, exposed, in, the, river, bed, in, several, stretches, the, middle, stretches, of, the, river, have, many, limestone, caves, which, were, inhabited, by, humans, in, the, prehistoric, era, the, caves, are, several, types, of, limestone, formations, namely, tuffeau, a, porous, type, of, chalk, not, to, be, confused, with, tufa, and, falun, formed, 12, million, years, ago, the, coastal, zone, shows, hard, dark, stones, granite, schist, and, thick, soil, mantle, the, river, has, a, discharge, rate, of, 863, m, 3, s, 30, 500, cu, ft, s, which, is, an, average, over, the, period, 1967, 2008, the, discharge, rate, varies, strongly, along, the, river, with, roughly, 350, m, 3, s, 12, 000, cu, ft, s, at, orl, ans, and, 900, m, 3, s, 32, 000, cu, ft, s, at, the, mouth, it, also, depends, strongly, on, the, season, and, the, flow, of, only, 10, m, 3, s, 350, cu, ft, s, is, not, uncommon, in, august, september, near, orl, ans, during, floods, which, usually, occur, in, february, and, march, but, also, in, other, periods, the, flow, sometimes, exceeds, 2, 000, m, 3, s, 71, 000, cu, ft, s, for, the, upper, loire, and, 8, 000, m, 3, s, 280, 000, cu, ft, s, in, the, lower, loire, the, most, serious, floods, occurred, in, 1856, 1866, and, 1911, unlike, most, other, rivers, in, western, europe, there, are, very, few, dams, or, locks, creating, obstacles, to, its, natural, flow, the, flow, is, no, longer, partly, regulated, by, three, dams, grangent, dam, and, villerest, dam, on, the, loire, and, naussac, dam, on, the, allier, the, villerest, dam, built, in, 1985, a, few, kilometres, a, few, miles, south, of, roanne, has, played, a, key, role, in, preventing, recent, flooding, as, a, result, the, loire, is, a, very, popular, river, for, boating, excursions, flowing, through, a, pastoral, countryside, past, limestone, cliffs, and, historic, castles, four, nuclear, power, plants, are, located, on, the, river, belleville, chinon, dampierre, and, saint, laurent, in, 1700, the, port, of, nantes, numbered, more, inland, waterway, craft, than, any, other, port, in, france, testifying, to, the, historic, importance, of, navigation, on, france, s, longest, river, shallow, draught, gabares, and, other, river, craft, continued, to, transport, goods, into, the, industrial, era, including, coal, from, saint, tienne, loaded, on, to, barges, in, orl, ans, however, the, hazardous, free, flow, navigation, and, limited, tonnages, meant, that, railways, rapidly, killed, off, the, surviving, traffic, from, the, 1850s, in, 1894, a, company, was, set, up, to, promote, improvements, to, the, navigation, from, nantes, to, briare, the, works, were, authorised, in, 1904, and, carried, out, in, two, phases, from, angers, to, the, limit, of, tides, at, oudon, these, works, with, groynes, and, submersible, embankments, survive, and, contribute, to, the, limited, navigability, under, present, day, conditions, a, dam, across, the, loire, at, saint, l, ger, des, vignes, provides, navigable, conditions, to, cross, from, the, canal, du, nivernais, to, the, canal, lat, ral, la, loire, as, of, 2017, the, following, sections, are, navigable, the, french, language, adjective, lig, rien, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, loire, as, in, le, climat, lig, rien, the, climate, of, the, loire, valley, the, climate, is, considered, the, most, pleasant, of, northern, france, with, warmer, winters, and, more, generally, fewer, extremes, in, temperatures, rarely, exceeding, 38, c, 100, f, it, is, identified, as, temperate, maritime, climate, and, is, characterised, by, the, lack, of, dry, seasons, and, by, heavy, rains, and, snowfall, in, winter, especially, in, the, upper, streams, the, number, of, sunny, hours, per, year, varies, between, 1400, and, 2200, and, increases, from, northwest, to, southeast, the, loire, valley, in, particular, enjoys, a, pleasant, temperate, climate, the, region, experiences, a, rainfall, of, 690, mm, 27, 2, in, along, the, coast, and, 648, mm, 25, 5, in, inland, the, centre, region, of, the, loire, river, valley, accounts, for, the, largest, forest, in, france, the, forest, of, orl, ans, french, for, t, d,

mostly, under, private, control, consists, of, tree, species, of, oak, beech, and, pine, in, the, marshy, lands, ash, alder, and, willows, are, grown, with, duckweed, providing, the, needed, natural, fertilizing, effect, the, atlantic, coast, is, home, to, several, aquatic, herbs, the, important, species, is, salicornia, which, is, used, as, a, culinary, ingredient, on, account, of, its, diuretic, value, greeks, introduced, vines, romans, introduced, melons, apples, cherries, quinces, and, pears, during, the, middle, ages, apart, from, extracting, saffron, from, purple, crocus, species, in,

flows, through, the, continental, ecoregions, of, massif, central, and, paris, basin, south, and, in, its, lower, course, partly, through, south, atlantic, and, brittany, with, more, than, 100, alga, species, the, loire, has, the, highest, phytoplankton, diversity, among, french, rivers, the, most, abundant, are, diatoms, and, green, algae, about, 15, by, mass, which, mostly, occur, in, the, lower, reaches, their, total, mass, is, low, when, the, river, flow, exceeds, 800, m, 3, s, 28, 000, cu, ft, s, and, become, significant, at, flows, of, 300, m, 3, s, 11, 000, cu, ft, s, or, lower, which, occur, in, summer, with, decreasing, flow, first, species, which, appear, are, single, celled, diatoms, such, as, cyclostephanos, invisitatus, c, meneghiniana, s, hantzschii, and, thalassiosira, pseudonana, they, are, then, joined, by, multicellular, forms, including, fragilaria, crotonensis, nitzschia, fruticosa, and, skeletonema, potamos, as, well, as, green, algae, which, form, star, shaped, or, prostrate, colonies, whereas, the, total, biomass, is, low, in, the, upper, reaches, the, biodiversity, is, high, with, more, than, 250, taxa, at, orl, ans, at, high, flows, and, in, the, upper, reaches, the, fraction, of, the, green, algae, decrease, and, the, phytoplankton, is, dominated, by, diatoms, heterotrophic, bacteria, are, represented, by, cocci, 49, rods, 35, colonies, 12, and, filaments, 4, with, a, total, density, of, up, to, 1, 4, 10, 10, cells, per, litre, nearly, every, freshwater, fish, species, of, france, can, be, found, in, the, loire, river, basin, that, is, about, 57, species, from, 20, families, many, of, them, are, migratory, with, 11, species, ascending, the, river, for, spawning, the, most, common, species, are, the, atlantic,

species, are, represented, by, the, rock, bass, ambloplites, rupestris, although, only, one, native, fish, species, has, become, extinct, in, the, loire, namely, the, european, sea, sturgeon, acipenser, sturio, in, the, 1940s, the, fish, population, is, declining, mostly, due, to, the, decrease, in, the, spawning, areas, the, latter, are, mostly, affected, by, the, industrial, pollution, construction, of, dams, and, drainage, of, oxbows, and, swamps, the, loss, of, spawning, grounds, mostly, affects, the, pike, esox, lucius, which, is, the, major, predator, of, the, loire, as, well, as, eel, carp, rudd, and, salmon, the, great, loire, salmon, a, subspecies, of, atlantic, salmon, is, regarded, as, the, symbolic, fish, of, the, river, its, population, has, decreased, from, about, 100, 000, in, the, 19th, century, to, below, 100, in, the, 1990s, that, resulted, in, the, adoption, of, a, total, ban, of, salmon, fishing, in, the, loire, basin, in, 1984, a, salmon, restoration, program, was, initiated, in, the, 1980s, and, included, such, as, measures, as, removal, of, two, obsolete, hydroelectric, dams, and, introduction, of, juvenile, stock, as, a, result, the, salmon, population, increased, to, about, 500, in, 2005, most, amphibians, of, the, loire, are, found, in, the, slow, flow, areas, near, the, delta, especially, in, the, floodplain, marshes, and, oxbows, they, are, dominated, by, the, fire, salamander, salamandra, salamandra, frogs, and, toads, the, toads, include, bufo, bufo, alytes, obstetricans, bombina, variegata, bufo, calamita, pelobates,

are, water, birds, 44, species, are, common, for, managed, forests, 41, to, natural, forests, 13, to, open, and, 12, to, rocky, areas, this, avifauna, has, been, rather, stable, at, least, between, the, 1980s, and, 2000s, with, significant, abundance, variations, observed, only, for, 17, species, of, those, five, species, were, growing, in, population, four, declining, and, other, eight, were, fluctuating, some, of, these, variations, had, a, global, nature, such, as, the, expansion, of, the, mediterranean, gull, in, europe, the, loire, has, been, described, as, constantly, under, threat, of, losing, its, status, as, the, last, wild, river, in, france, the, reason, for, this, is, its, sheer, length, and, possibility, of, extensive, navigation, which, severely, limits, the, scope, of, river, conservation, the, federation, a, member, of, the, iucn, since, 1970, has, been, very, important, in, the, campaign, to, save, the, loire, river, system, from, development, in, 1986, the, french, government, the, loire, brittany, water, agency, and, the, epala, settled, an, agreement, on, flood, prevention, and, water, storage, programme, in, the, basin, involving, construction, of, four, large, dams, one, on, the, loire, itself, and, three, on, the, allier, and, cher, the, french, government, proposed, a, construction, of, a, dam, at, serre, de, la, fare, on, the, upper, loire, which, would, have, been, an, environmental, catastrophe, as, it, would, have, inundated, some, 20, km, 12, mi, of, pristine, gorges, as, a, result, the, wwf, and, other, ngos, established, the, loire, vivante, living, loire, network, in, 1988, to, oppose, this, and, arranged, an, initial, meeting, with, the, french, minister, of, the, environment, the, french, government, initially, rejected, the, conservation, concerns, and, in, 1989, gave, the, projects, the, green, light, this, sparked, public, demonstrations, by, the, wwf, and, conservation, groups, in, 1990, loire, vivante, met, with, the, french, prime, minister, and, the, government, successfully, as, the, government, demanded, that, the, epala, embark, upon, major, reforms, in, its, approach, to, managing, the, river, due, to, extensive, lobbying, the, proposal, and, the, other, dam, proposals, were, eventually, rejected, in, the, 1990s, the, gorges, zone, has, since, been, protected, as, a, natura, 2000, site, under, european, union, environmental, legislation, the, wwf, were, particularly, important, in, changing, the, perception, of, the, french, authorities, in, support, for, dam, building, to, environmental, protection, and, sustainable, management, of, its, river, basin, in, 1992, they, aided, the, loire, nature, project, which, received, funds, of, some, us, 9, million, under, the, eu, s, life, programme, until, 1999, embarking, upon, restoration, to, the, river, s, ecosystems, and, wildlife, that, year, the, upper, loire, valley, farmers, association, was, also, established, through, a, partnership, between, sos, loire, vivante, and, a, farmers, union, to, promote, sustainable, rural, tourism, the, french, government, adopted, the, natural, loire, river, plan, plan, loire, grandeur, nature, in, january, 1994, initiating, the, decommissioning, of, three, dams, on, the, river, the, final, dam, was, decommissioned, by, lectricit, de, france, at, a, cost, of, 7, million, francs, in, 1998, the, basis, of, the, decision, was, that, the, economic, benefits, of, the, dams, did, not, outweigh, their, significant, ecological, impacts, so, the, intention, was, to, restore, the, riverine, ecosystems, and, replenish, great, loire, salmon, stocks, the, loire, is, unique, in, this, respect, as, the, atlantic, salmon, can, swim, as, far, as, 900, km, 560, mi, up, the, river,

garden, of, france, due, to, the, abundance, of, vineyards, fruit, orchards, artichoke, asparagus, and, cherry, fields, which, line, the, banks, of, the, river, and, also, as, the, cradle, of, the, french, language, it, is, also, noteworthy, for, its, architectural, heritage, in, part, for, its, historic, towns, such, as, amboise, angers, blois, chinon, nantes, orl, ans, saumur, and, tours, but, in, particular, for, its, castles, such, as, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, ch, teau, d, angers, ch, teau, de, chambord, ch, teau, de, montsoreau, ch, teau, d, uss, ch, teau, de, villandry, and,

shaped, by, centuries, of, interaction, between, local, populations, and, their, physical, environment, in, particular, the, loire, itself, architectural, edifices, were, created, in, loire, valley, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, with, the, defensive, fortress, like, structures, called, the, keeps, or, donjons, built, between, 987, and, 1040, by, anjou, count, foulques, nerra, of, anjou, the, falcon, however, one, of, the, oldest, such, structures, in, france, is, the, donjon, de, foulques, nerra, built, in, 944, this, style, was, replaced, by, the, religious, architectural, style, in, the, 12th, to, 14th, centuries, when, the, impregnable, ch, teau, fortresses, were, built, on, top, of, rocky, hills, one, of, the, impressive, fortresses, of, this, type, is, the, ch, teau, d, angers, which, has, 17, gruesome, towers, this, was, followed, by, aesthetically, built, ch, teaux, to, also, function, as, residential, units, which, substituted, the, quadrangular, layout, of, the, keep, however, the, exterior, defensive, structures, in, the, form, of, portcullis, and, moats, surrounding, the, thick, walls, of, the, ch, teaux, forts, were, retained, there, was, further, refinement, in, the, design, of, the, ch, teaux, in, the, 15th, century, before, the, baroque, style, came, into, prominence, with, decorative, and, elegantly, designed, interiors, and, which, became, fashionable, from, the, 16th, to, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, baroque, style, artists, who, created, some, of, the, exquisite, ch, teau, structures, were, the, parisian, fran, ois, mansart, 1598, 1662, whose, classical, symmetrical, design, is, seen, in, the, ch, teau, de, blois, jacques, bougier, 1635, of, blois, whose, classical, design, is, the, ch, teau, de, cheverny, guillaume, bautru, remodelled, the, ch, teau, de, serrant, at, the, extreme, western, end, of, the, valley, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, feverish, pace, in, the, design, of, ch, teaux, for, introducing, exotic, styles, a, notable, structure, of, this, period, is, the, pagode, de, chanteloup, at, amboise, which, was, built, between, 1773, and, 1778, the, neoclassical, architectural, style, was, a, revival, of, classical, style, of, architecture, which, emerged, in, the, mid, 18th, century, one, such, notable, structure, is, the, ch, teau, de, menars, built, by, jacques, ange, gabriel, 1698, 1782, who, was, the, royal, architect, in, the, court, of, louis, xv, 1715, 74, this, style, was, perpetuated, during, the, reign, of, louis, xvi, 1774, 92, but, with, more, refinements, one, such, refined, ch, teau, seen, close, to, angers, is, the, ch, teau, de, montgeoffroy, furnishings, inside, the, ch, teaux, also, witnessed, changes, to, suit, the, living, styles, of, its, occupants,
