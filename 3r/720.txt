are, several, overlapping, definitions, including, ones, related, to, culture, language, politics, and, history, and, sometimes, involving, neighbouring, countries, the, demonym, associated, with, flanders, is, fleming, while, the, corresponding, adjective, is, flemish, which, can, also, refer, to, the, collective, of, dutch, dialects, spoken, in, that, area, or, more, generally, the, belgian, variant, of, standard, dutch, the, official, capital, of, flanders, is, the, city, of, brussels, although, the, brussels, capital, region, that, includes, it, has, an, independent, regional, government, the, powers, of, the, government, of, flanders, consist, among, others, of, economic, affairs, in, the, flemish, region, and, the, community, aspects, of, flanders, life, in, brussels, such, as, flemish, culture, and, education, geographically, flanders, is, mainly, flat, and, incorporates, the, whole, coast, of, belgium, on, the, north, sea, it, borders, the, french, department, of, nord, to, the, south, west, near, the, coast, the, dutch, provinces, of, zeeland, north, brabant, and, limburg, to, the, north, and, east, and, the, walloon, provinces, of, hainaut, walloon, brabant, and, li, ge, to, the, south, despite, accounting, for, only, 45, of, belgium, s, territory, more, than, half, the, population, lives, there, 6, 821, 770, or, 58, out, of, 11, 763, 650, belgian, inhabitants, as, of, january, 2024, much, of, flanders, is, agriculturally, fertile, and, densely, populated, at, 501, km, 2, 1, 300, sq, mi, the, brussels, region, is, an, officially, bilingual, enclave, within, the, flemish, region, flanders, also, has, exclaves, of, its, own, voeren, in, the, east, is, between, wallonia, and, the, netherlands, and, baarle, hertog, in, the, north, consists, of, 22, exclaves, surrounded, by, the, netherlands, not, including, brussels, there, are, five, present, day, flemish, provinces, antwerp, east, flanders, flemish, brabant, limburg, and, west, flanders, the, official, language, is, dutch, the, area, of, today, s, flanders, has, figured, prominently, in, european, history, since, the, middle, ages, the, original, county, of, flanders, stretched, around, ad, 900, from, the, strait, of, dover, to, the, scheldt, estuary, and, expanded, from, there, this, county, also, still, corresponds, roughly, with, the, modern, day, belgian, provinces, of, west, flanders, and, east, flanders, along, with, neighbouring, parts, of, france, and, the, netherlands, in, this, period, cities, such, as, ghent, and, bruges, of, the, historic, county, of, flanders, and, later, antwerp, of, the, duchy, of, brabant, made, it, one, of, the, richest, and, most, urbanised, parts, of, europe, trading, and, weaving, the, wool, of, neighbouring, lands, into, cloth, for, both, domestic, use, and, export, as, a, consequence, a, very, sophisticated, culture, developed, with, impressive, achievements, in, the, arts, and, architecture, rivaling, those, of, northern, italy, belgium, was, one, of, the, centres, of, the, 19th, century, industrial, revolution, but, this, occurred, mainly, in, french, speaking, wallonia, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, due, to, massive, national, investments, in, port, infrastructure, flanders, economy, modernised, rapidly, and, today, flanders, and, brussels, are, much, wealthier, than, wallonia, being, among, the, wealthiest, regions, in, europe, and, the, world, in, accordance, with, late, 20th, century, belgian, state, reforms, flanders, was, made, into, two, political, entities, the, flemish, region, dutch, vlaams, gewest, and, the, flemish, community, dutch, vlaamse, gemeenschap, these, entities, were, merged, although, geographically, the, flemish, community, which, has, a, broader, cultural, mandate, covers, brussels, whereas, the, flemish, region, does, not, the, term, flanders, has, several, main, modern, meanings, the, name, originally, applied, to, the, ancien, r, gime, territory, called, the, county, of, flanders, that, existed, from, the, 8th, century, latin, flandria, until, its, absorption, by, the, french, first, republic, until, the, 1600s, this, county, also, extended, over, parts, of, what, are, now, france, and, the, netherlands, however, the, term, came, to, be, used, for, a, bigger, territory, and, this, is, critical, to, the, evolution, of, modern, terminology, once, the, counts, of, flanders, who, were, also, dukes, of, burgundy, expanded, their, regional, power, to, create, the, bigger, entity, now, referred, to, by, historians, as, the, burgundian, netherlands, flanders, along, with, latin, belgium, were, the, first, two, common, names, to, describe, this, regional, block, with, the, breakaway, of, the, northern, netherlands, in, the, early, modern, period, the, term, flanders, continued, to, be, associated, with, the, whole, southern, part, of, the, low, countries, the, southern, spanish, or, austrian, netherlands, which, were, the, successors, of, the, burgundian, state, and, also, predecessors, of, modern, belgium, the, restriction, of, the, term, flanders, to, the, germanic, speaking, part, of, the, population, occurred, later, the, term, flemish, came, to, be, a, term, for, the, language, dutch, and, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, it, became, increasingly, common, to, refer, exclusively, to, the, dutch, speaking, part, of, belgium, as, flanders, belgium, divided, itself, into, official, french, and, dutch, speaking, parts, starting, in, the, early, 60s, today, flanders, extends, over, the, northern, part, of, belgium, including, not, only, the, dutch, speaking, belgian, parts, of, the, medieval, duchy, of, brabant, which, was, united, with, flanders, since, the, middle, ages, but, also, belgian, limburg, which, corresponds, closely, to, the, medieval, county, of, loon, and, was, never, under, burgundian, control, the, ambiguity, between, this, wider, cultural, area, and, that, of, the, county, or, province, still, remains, in, discussions, about, the, region, in, most, present, day, contexts, however, the, term, flanders, is, taken, to, refer, to, either, the, political, social, cultural, and, linguistic, community, and, the, corresponding, official, institution, the, flemish, community, or, the, geographical, area, one, of, the, three, institutional, regions, in, belgium, namely, the, flemish, region, in, the, history, of, art, and, other, fields, the, adjectives, flemish, and, netherlandish, are, commonly, used, to, designate, all, the, artistic, production, in, this, area, before, about, 1580, after, which, it, refers, specifically, to, the, southern, netherlands, for, example, the, term, flemish, primitives, now, outdated, in, english, but, used, in, french, dutch, and, other, languages, is, a, synonym, for, early, netherlandish, painting, and, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, mosan, art, categorized, as, flemish, art, in, music, the, franco, flemish, school, is, also, known, as, the, dutch, school, within, this, dutch, speaking, part, of, belgium, french, has, never, ceased, to, be, spoken, by, some, citizens, and, jewish, groups, have, been, speaking, yiddish, in, antwerp, for, centuries, regardless, of, nationality, or, linguistic, background, according, to, belgian, law, education, in, schools, located, in, the, flemish, region, must, be, mainly, in, the, dutch, language, in, brussels, teaching, is, also, done, in, french, when, julius, caesar, conquered, the, area, he, described, it, as, the, less, economically, developed, and, more, warlike, part, of, gallia, belgica, his, informants, told, him, that, especially, in, the, east, the, tribes, claimed, ancestral, connections, and, kinship, with, the, germanic, peoples, then, east, of, the, rhine, under, the, roman, empire, the, whole, of, gallia, belgica, became, an, administrative, province, the, future, counties, of, flanders, and, brabant, remained, part, of, this, province, connected, to, what, is, now, france, but, in, the, east, modern, limburg, became, part, of, the, rhine, frontier, province, of, germania, inferior, connected, to, what, is, now, the, netherlands, and, germany, gallia, belgica, and, germania, inferior, were, the, two, most, northerly, continental, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, future, county, of, flanders, the, main, belgic, tribe, in, early, roman, times, was, the, menapii, but, also, on, the, coast, were, the, marsacii, and, morini, in, the, central, part, of, modern, belgium, were, the, nervii, whose, territory, corresponded, to, medieval, brabant, as, well, as, french, speaking, hainaut, in, the, east, was, the, large, district, of, the, tungri, which, covered, both, french, and, dutch, speaking, parts, of, eastern, belgium, the, tungri, were, understood, to, have, links, to, germanic, tribes, east, of, the, rhine, another, notable, group, were, the, toxandrians, who, appear, to, have, lived, in, the, kempen, region, in, the, northern, parts, of, both, the, nervian, and, tungrian, districts, probably, stretching, into, the, modern, netherlands, the, roman, administrative, districts, civitates, of, the, menapii, nervii, and, tungri, therefore, corresponded, roughly, with, the, medieval, counties, of, flanders, brabant, and, loon, and, the, modern, flemish, provinces, of, east, and, west, flanders, menapii, brabant, and, antwerp, the, northern, nervii, and, belgian, limburg, part, of, the, tungri, brabant, appears, to, have, been, separated, from, the, tungri, by, a, relatively, unpopulated, forest, area, the, silva, carbonaria, forming, a, natural, boundary, between, northeast, and, southwest, belgium, linguistically, the, tribes, in, this, area, were, under, celtic, influence, in, the, south, and, germanic, influence, in, the, east, but, there, is, disagreement, about, what, languages, were, spoken, locally, apart, from, vulgar, latin, and, there, may, even, have, been, an, intermediate, nordwestblock, language, related, to, both, by, the, first, century, ad, germanic, languages, appear, to, have, become, prevalent, in, the, area, of, the, tungri, as, roman, influence, waned, frankish, populations, settled, in, the, tungiran, area, east, of, the, silva, carbonaria, and, eventually, pushed, through, it, under, chlodio, they, had, kings, in, each, roman, district, civitas, in, the, meantime, the, franks, contributed, to, the, roman, military, the, first, merovingian, king, childeric, i, was, king, of, the, franks, within, the, military, of, gaul, he, became, leader, of, the, administration, of, belgica, secunda, which, included, the, civitas, of, the, menapii, the, future, county, of, flanders, from, there, his, son, clovis, i, managed, to, conquer, both, the, roman, populations, of, northern, france, and, the, frankish, populations, beyond, the, forest, areas, the, county, of, flanders, was, a, feudal, fief, in, west, francia, the, first, certain, count, in, the, comital, family, baldwin, i, of, flanders, is, first, reported, in, a, document, of, 862, when, he, eloped, with, a, daughter, of, his, king, charles, the, bald, the, region, developed, as, a, medieval, economic, power, with, a, large, degree, of, political, autonomy, while, its, trading, cities, remained, strong, it, was, weakened, and, divided, when, districts, fell, under, direct, french, royal, rule, in, the, late, 12th, century, the, remaining, parts, of, flanders, came, under, the, rule, of, the, counts, of, neighbouring, imperial, hainaut, under, baldwin, v, of, hainaut, in, 1191, during, the, late, middle, ages, flanders, s, trading, towns, notably, ghent, bruges, and, ypres, made, it, one, of, the, richest, and, most, urbanized, parts, of, europe, weaving, the, wool, of, neighbouring, lands, into, cloth, for, both, domestic, use, and, export, as, a, consequence, a, sophisticated, culture, developed, with,

considerable, power, in, flanders, increasingly, powerful, from, the, 12th, century, the, territory, s, autonomous, urban, communes, were, instrumental, in, defeating, a, french, attempt, at, annexation, 1300, 1302, finally, defeating, the, french, in, the, battle, of, the, golden, spurs, 11, july, 1302, near, kortrijk, two, years, later, the, uprising, was, defeated, and, flanders, indirectly, remained, part, of, the, french, crown, flemish, prosperity, waned, in, the, following, century, due, to, widespread, european, population, decline, following, the, black, death, of, 1348, the, disruption, of, trade, during, the, anglo, french, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, and, increased, english, cloth, production, flemish, weavers, had, gone, over, to, worstead, and, north, walsham, in, norfolk, in, the, 12th, century, and, established, the, woolen, industry, the, county, of, flanders, started, to, take, control, of, the, neighbouring, county, of, brabant, during, the, life, of, louis, ii, count, of, flanders, 1330, 1384, who, fought, his, sister, in, law, joanna, duchess, of, brabant, for, control, of, it, the, entire, area, straddling, the, ancient, boundary, of, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, later, passed, to, philip, the, bold, in, 1384, the, duke, of, burgundy, with, his, capital, in, brussels, the, titles, were, eventually, more, clearly, united, under, his, grandson, philip, the, good, 1396, 1467, this, large, duchy, passed, in, 1477, to, the, habsburg, dynasty, and, in, 1556, to, the, kings, of, spain, western, and, southern, districts, of, flanders, were, confirmed, under, french, rule, under, successive, treaties, of, 1659, artois, 1668, and, 1678, the, county, of, loon, approximately, the, modern, flemish, province, of, limburg, remained, independent, of, france, forming, a, part, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, li, ge, until, the, french, revolution, but, surrounded, by, the, burgundians, and, under, their, influence, in, 1500, charles, v, was, born, in, ghent, he, inherited, the, seventeen, provinces, 1506, spain, 1516, with, its, colonies, and, in, 1519, was, elected, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, issued, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1549, which, established, the, low, countries, as, the, seventeen, provinces, or, spanish, netherlands, in, its, broad, sense, as, an, entity, separate, from, the, holy, roman, empire, and, from, france, in, 1556, charles, v, abdicated, due, to, ill, health, he, suffered, from, crippling, gout, spain, and, the, seventeen, provinces, went, to, his, son, philip, ii, of, spain, over, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, antwerp, grew, to, become, the, second, largest, european, city, north, of, the, alps, by, 1560, antwerp, was, the, richest, city, in, europe, at, this, time, according, to, luc, normand, tellier, it, is, estimated, that, the, port, of, antwerp, was, earning, the, spanish, crown, seven, times, more, revenues, than, the, americas, meanwhile, protestantism, had, reached, the, low, countries, among, the, wealthy, traders, of, antwerp, the, lutheran, beliefs, of, the, german, hanseatic, traders, found, appeal, perhaps, partly, for, economic, reasons, the, spread, of, protestantism, in, this, city, was, aided, by, the, presence, of, an, augustinian, cloister, founded, 1514, in, the, st, andries, quarter, luther, an, augustinian, himself, had, taught, some, of, the, monks, and, his, works, were, in, print, by, 1518, the, first, lutheran, martyrs, came, from, antwerp, the, reformation, resulted, in, consecutive, but, overlapping, waves, of, reform, a, lutheran, followed, by, a, militant, anabaptist, then, a, mennonite, and, finally, a, calvinistic, movement, these, movements, existed, independently, of, each, other, philip, ii, a, devout, catholic, and, self, proclaimed, protector, of, the, counter, reformation, suppressed, calvinism, in, flanders, brabant, and, holland, what, is, now, approximately, belgian, limburg, was, part, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, li, ge, and, was, catholic, de, facto, in, 1566, the, wave, of, iconoclasm, known, as, the, beeldenstorm, was, a, prelude, to, religious, war, between, catholics, and, protestants, especially, the, anabaptists, the, beeldenstorm, started, in, what, is, now, french, flanders, with, open, air, sermons, dutch, hagepreken, that, spread, through, the, low, countries, first, to, antwerp, and, ghent, and, from, there, further, east, and, north, subsequently, philip, ii, of, spain, sent, the, duke, of, alba, to, the, provinces, to, repress, the, revolt, alba, recaptured, the, southern, part, of, the, provinces, who, signed, the, union, of, atrecht, which, meant, that, they, would, accept, the, spanish, government, on, condition, of, more, freedom, but, the, northern, part, of, the, provinces, signed, the, union, of, utrecht, and, settled, in, 1581, the, republic, of, the, seven, united, netherlands, spanish, troops, quickly, started, fighting, the, rebels, and, the, spanish, armies, conquered, the, important, trading, cities, of, bruges, and, ghent, antwerp, which, was, then, the, most, important, port, in, the, world, also, had, to, be, conquered, but, before, the, revolt, was, defeated, a, war, between, spain, and, england, broke, out, forcing, spanish, troops, to, halt, their, advance, on, 17, august, 1585, antwerp, fell, this, ended, the, eighty, years, war, for, the, from, now, on, southern, netherlands, the, united, provinces, the, northern, netherlands, fought, on, until, 1648, the, peace, of, westphalia, during, the, war, with, england, the, rebels, from, the, north, strengthened, by, refugees, from, the, south, started, a, campaign, to, reclaim, areas, lost, to, philip, ii, s, spanish, troops, they, conquered, a, considerable, part, of, brabant, the, later, north, brabant, of, the, netherlands, and, the, south, bank, of, the, scheldt, estuary, zeelandic, flanders, before, being, stopped, by, spanish, troops, the, front, at, the, end, of, this, war, stabilized, and, became, the, border, between, present, day, belgium, and, the, netherlands, the, dutch, as, they, later, became, known, had, managed, to, reclaim, enough, of, spanish, controlled, flanders, to, close, off, the, river, scheldt, effectively, cutting, antwerp, off, from, its, trade, routes, the, fall, of, antwerp, to, the, spanish, and, the, closing, of, the, scheldt, caused, considerable, emigration, many, calvinist, merchants, of, antwerp, and, other, flemish, cities, left, flanders, and, migrated, north, many, of, them, settled, in, amsterdam, which, was, a, smaller, port, important, only, in, the, baltic, trade, the, flemish, exiles, helped, to, rapidly, transform, amsterdam, into, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, ports, this, is, why, the, exodus, is, sometimes, described, as, creating, a, new, antwerp, flanders, and, brabant, went, into, a, period, of, relative, decline, from, the, time, of, the, thirty, years, war, in, the, northern, netherlands, the, mass, emigration, from, flanders, and, brabant, became, an, important, driving, force, behind, the, dutch, golden, age, although, arts, remained, relatively, impressive, for, another, century, with, peter, paul, rubens, 1577, 1640, and, anthony, van, dyck, flanders, lost, its, former, economic, and, intellectual, power, under, spanish,

philip, ii, of, spain, left, them, in, 1559, in, 1794, the, french, republican, army, started, using, antwerp, as, the, northernmost, naval, port, of, france, the, following, year, france, officially, annexed, flanders, as, the, d, partements, of, lys, escaut, deux, n, thes, meuse, inf, rieure, and, dyle, obligatory, french, army, service, for, all, men, aged, 16, 25, years, was, a, main, reason, for, the, uprising, against, the, french, in, 1798, known, as, the, boerenkrijg, peasants, war, with, the, heaviest, fighting, in, the, campine, area, after, the, defeat, of, napoleon, bonaparte, at,

generaal, the, nobility, mainly, coming, from, the, south, became, more, and, more, estranged, from, their, northern, colleagues, resentment, grew, between, the, roman, catholics, from, the, south, and, the, protestants, from, the, north, and, also, between, the, powerful, liberal, bourgeoisie, from, the, south, and, their, more, moderate, colleagues, from, the, north, on, 25, august, 1830, after, the, showing, of, the, opera, la, muette, de, portici, of, daniel, auber, in, brussels, the, belgian, revolution, sparked, on, 4, october, 1830, the, provisional, government, dutch, voorlopig,

monarchy, under, the, house, of, saxe, coburg, flanders, now, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, belgium, which, was, recognized, by, the, major, european, powers, on, 20, january, 1831, the, cessation, was, recognized, by, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, on, 19, april, 1839, in, 1830, the, belgian, revolution, led, to, the, splitting, up, of, the, two, countries, belgium, was, confirmed, as, an, independent, state, by, the, treaty, of, london, of, 1839, but, deprived, of, the, eastern, half, of, limburg, now, dutch, limburg, and, the, eastern, half, of, luxembourg, now, the, grand, duchy, of, luxembourg, sovereignty, over, zeelandic, flanders, south, of, the, westerscheldt, river, delta, was, left, with, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, which, was, allowed, to, levy, a, toll, on, all, traffic, to, antwerp, harbour, until, 1863, in, 1873, dutch, became, an, official, language, in, public, secondary, schools, in, 1898, dutch, and, french, were, declared, equal, languages, in, laws, and, royal, orders, in, 1930, the, first, flemish, university, was, opened, the, first, official, translation, of, the, belgian, constitution, in, dutch, was, not, published, until, 1967, flanders, and, belgium, as, a, whole, saw, some, of, the, greatest, loss, of, life, on, the, western, front, of, the, first, world, war, in, particular, from, the, three, battles, of, ypres, the, war, strengthened, flemish, identity, and, consciousness, the, occupying, german, authorities, took, several, flemish, friendly, measures, the, resulting, suffering, of, the, war, is, remembered, by, flemish, organizations, during, the, yearly, yser, pilgrimage, in, diksmuide, at, the, monument, of, the, yser, tower, during, the, interbellum, and, world, war, ii, several, right, wing, fascist, and, or, national, socialistic, parties, emerged, in, belgium, since, these, parties, were, promised, more, rights, for, the, flemings, by, the, german, government, during, world, war, ii, many, of, them, collaborated, with, the, nazi, regime, after, the, war, collaborators, or, people, who, were, zwart, black, during, the, war, were, prosecuted, and, punished, among, them, many, flemish, nationalists, whose, main, political, goal, had, been, the, emancipation, of, flanders, as, a, result, until, today, flemish, nationalism, is, often, associated, with, right, wing, flemish, nationalism, is, however, a, direct, consequence, of, the, events, of, the, years, prior, to, the, first, world, war, in, which, many, were, oppressed, by, the, french, speaking,

ethnic, minority, youth, score, consistently, lower, and, the, difference, is, larger, than, in, most, comparable, countries, mirroring, the, historical, political, conflicts, between, the, secular, and, catholic, segments, of, the, population, the, flemish, educational, system, is, split, into, a, secular, branch, controlled, by, the, communities, the, provinces, or, the, municipalities, and, a, subsidised, religious, mostly, catholic, branch, for, the, subsidised, schools, the, main, costs, such, as, the, teacher, s, wages, and, building, maintenance, completely, borne, by, the, flemish, government, subsidised, schools, are, also, free, to, determine, their, own, teaching, and, examination, methods, but, in, exchange, they, must, be, able, to, prove, that, certain, minimal, terms, are, achieved, by, keeping, records, of, the, given, lessons, and, exams, it, should, however, be, noted, that, at, least, for, the, catholic, schools, the, religious, authorities, have, very, limited, power, over, these, schools, neither, do, the, schools, have, a, lot, of, power, on, their, own, instead, the, catholic, schools, are, a, member, of, the, catholic, umbrella, organisation, vsko, the, vsko, determines, most, practicalities, for, schools, like, the, advised, schedules, per, study, field, however, there, s, freedom, of, education, in, flanders, which, doesn, t, only, mean, that, every, pupil, can, choose, his, her, preferred, school, but, also, that, every, organisation, can, found, a, school, and, even, be, subsidised, when, abiding, the, different, rules, this, resulted, also, in, some, smaller, school, systems, follow, methodical, pedagogies, e, g, steiner, montessori, or, freinet, or, serve, the, jewish, and, protestant, minorities, during, the, school, year, 2003, 2004, 68, 30, of, the, total, population, of, children, between, the, ages, of, six, and, 18, went, to, subsidized, private, schools, both, religious, schools, or, methodical, pedagogies, schools, the, big, freedom, given, to, schools, results, in, a, constant, competition, to, be, the, best, school, the, schools, get, certain, reputations, amongst, parents, and, employers, so, it, s, important, for, schools, to, be, the, best, school, since, the, subsidies, depend, on, the, number, of, pupils, this, competition, has, been, pinpointed, as, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, high, overall, quality, of, the, flemish, education, however, the, importance, of, a, school, s, reputation, also, makes, schools, more, eager, to, expel, pupils, that, don, t, perform, well, resulting, in, the, ethnic, differences, and, the, well, known, waterfall, system, pupils, start, high, in, the, perceived, hierarchy, and, then, drop, towards, more, professional, oriented, directions, or, easier, schools, when, they, can, t, handle, the, pressure, any, longer, healthcare, is, a, federal, matter, but, the, flemish, government, is, responsible, for, care, health, education, and, preventive, care, the, standard, language, in, flanders, is, dutch, spelling, and, grammar, are, regulated, by, a, single, authority, the, dutch, language, union, nederlandse, taalunie, comprising, a, committee, of, ministers, of, the, flemish, and, dutch, governments, their, advisory, council, of, appointed, experts, a, controlling, commission, of, 22, parliamentarians, and, a, secretariate, the, term, flemish, can, be, applied, to, the, dutch, spoken, in, flanders, it, shows, many, regional, and, local, variations, the, biggest, difference, between, belgian, dutch, and, dutch, used, in, the, netherlands, is, in, the, pronunciation, of, words, the, dutch, spoken, in, the, north, of, the, netherlands, is, typically, described, as, being, sharper, while, belgian, dutch, is, softer, in, belgian, dutch, there, are, also, fewer, vowels, pronounced, as, diphthongs, when, it, comes, to, spelling, belgian, dutch, language, purists, historically, avoided, writing, words, using, a, french, spelling, or, searched, for, specific, translations, of, words, derived, from, french, while, the, dutch, often, retain, the, french, spelling, for, example, the, dutch, word, punaise, english, drawing, pin, is, derived, directly, from, the, french, language, belgian, dutch, language, purists, have, lobbied, to, accept, the, word, duimspijker, literally, thumb, spike, as, official, dutch, though, the, dutch, language, union, never, accepted, it, as, standard, dutch, other, proposals, by, purists, were, sometimes, accepted, and, sometimes, reverted, again, in, later, spelling, revisions, as, language, purists, were, quite, often, professionally, involved, in, language, e, g, as, a, teacher, these, unofficial, purist, translations, are, found, more, often, in,
