along, with, northwestern, lowlands, of, the, sierra, madre, oriental, range, its, largest, continual, expanse, is, located, in, mexico, covering, a, large, portion, of, the, state, of, chihuahua, along, with, portions, of, coahuila, north, eastern, durango, the, extreme, northern, part, of, zacatecas, and, small, western, portions, of, nuevo, le, n, with, an, area, of, about, 501, 896, km, 2, 193, 783, sq, mi, it, is, the, largest, hot, desert, in, north, america, the, desert, is, fairly, young, existing, for, only, 8000, years, there, are, several, larger, mountain, ranges, in, the, chihuahuan, desert, including, the, sierra, madre, the, sierra, del, carmen, the, organ, mountains, the, franklin, mountains, the, sacramento, mountains, the, chisos, mountains, the, guadalupe, mountains, and, the, davis, mountains, these, create, sky, islands, of, cooler, wetter, climates, adjacent, to, or, within, the, desert, and, such, elevated, areas, have, both, coniferous, and, broadleaf, woodlands, including, forests, along, drainages, and, favored, exposures, the, lower, elevations, of, the, sandia, manzano, mountains, the, magdalena, san, mateo, mountains, and, the, gila, region, partly, border, the, chihuahuan, desert, and, partly, border, other, ecoregions, that, are, not, deserts, there, are, few, urban, areas, within, the, desert, the, largest, is, ciudad, ju, rez, with, almost, two, million, inhabitants, chihuahua, saltillo, and, torre, n, and, the, us, cities, of, el, paso, and, albuquerque, alamogordo, alpine, benson, carlsbad, carrizozo, deming, fort, stockton, fort, sumner, las, cruces, marfa, pecos, roswell, and, willcox, are, among, the, other, communities, in, this, ecoregion, safford, and, benson, in, arizona, are, located, in, low, elevations, of, the, western, edges, of, the, chihuahuan, desert, but, in, an, ecotone, with, the, sonoran, desert, according, to, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, the, chihuahuan, desert, may, be, the, most, biologically, diverse, desert, in, the, world, as, measured, by, species, richness, or, endemism, the, region, has, been, badly, degraded, mainly, due, to, grazing, many, native, grasses, and, other, species, have, become, dominated, by, woody, native, plants, including, creosote, bush, and, mesquite, due, to, overgrazing, and, other, urbanization, the, mexican, wolf, once, abundant, was, nearly, extinct, and, remains, on, the, endangered, species, list, the, desert, is, mainly, a, rain, shadow, desert, because, the, two, main, mountain, ranges, which, bound, the, desert, the, sierra, madre, occidental, to, the, west, and, the, sierra, madre, oriental, to, the, east, block, most, moisture, from, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, respectively, climatically, the, desert, mostly, has, an, arid, mesothermal, climate, with, one, rainy, season, in, the, late, summer, and, smaller, amounts, of, precipitation, in, early, winter, the, mean, daily, temperature, of, the, coldest, month, warmer, than, 0, c, 32, f, the, majority, of, rain, falls, between, late, june, and, early, october, during, the, north, american, monsoon, when, moist, air, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, sea, of, cortez, penetrates, into, the, region, or, much, less, frequently, when, a, tropical, cyclone, moves, inland, and, stalls, owing, to, its, inland, position, and, higher, elevation, than, the, sonoran, desert, to, the, west, mostly, varying, from, 480, to, 1, 800, m, 1, 575, to, 5, 906, ft, in, elevation, the, desert, has, a, slightly, milder, climate, in, the, summer, though, usually, daytime, june, temperatures, are, in, the, range, of, 32, to, 40, c, or, 90, to, 104, f, with, mild, to, cool, winters, and, occasional, to, frequent, freezes, the, hottest, temperatures, in, the, desert, occur, in, lower, elevation, areas, and, valleys, including, near, the, rio, grande, from, south, of, el, paso, into, the, big, bend, and, the, bolson, de, mapimi, a, subtropical, temperature, regime, describes, lower, elevations, in, the, texas, big, bend, region, up, to, the, presidio, and, candelaria, areas, then, southward, into, similar, elevations, while, a, warm, temperate, temperature, regime, describes, higher, elevations, and, further, north, the, average, annual, temperature, in, the, desert, varies, from, about, 13, to, 22, c, 55, to, 72, f, depending, on, elevation, and, latitude, the, mean, annual, precipitation, for, the, chihuahuan, desert, is, 235, mm, 9, 3, in, with, a, range, of, approximately, 150, 400, mm, 6, 16, in, although, it, receives, more, precipitation, than, most, other, warm, desert, ecoregions, nearly, two, thirds, of, the, arid, zone, stations, have, annual, totals, between, 225, and, 275, mm, 8, 9, and, 10, 8, in, snowfall, is, scant, except, at, the, higher, elevation, edges, northern, and, eastern, portions, have, more, definite, winters, than, southern, and, western, portions, receiving, a, portion, of, winter, precipitation, as, snowfall, most, winters, the, creosote, bush, larrea, tridentata, is, the, dominant, plant, species, on, gravelly, and, occasional, sandy, soils, in, valley, areas, within, the, chihuahuan, desert, the, other, species, found, with, creosote, bush, depend, on, factors, including, the, soil, type, elevation, and, degree, of, slope, viscid, acacia, vachellia, vernicosa, and, tarbush, flourensia, cernua, dominate, northern, portions, while, broom, dalea, psorothamnus, scoparius, occurs, on, sandy, soils, in, western, portions, yucca, and, opuntia, species, are, abundant, on, slopes, and, uplands, in, most, areas, while, arizona, rainbow, cactus, echinocereus, polyacanthus, and, mexican, fire, barrel, cactus, ferocactus, pilosus, inhabit, portions, near, the, us, mexico, border, herbaceous, plants, such, as, bush, muhly, muhlenbergia, porteri, blue, grama, bouteloua, gracilis, gypsum, grama, b, breviseta, and, hairy, grama, b, hirsuta, are, dominant, in, desert, grasslands, and, near, the, mountain, edges, including, the, sierra, madre, occidental, lechuguilla, agave, lechuguilla, honey, mesquite, prosopis, glandulosa, opuntia, macrocentra, and, echinocereus, pectinatus, are, the, dominant, species, in, western, coahuila, ocotillo, fouquieria, splendens, lechuguilla, and, yucca, filifera, are, the, most, common, species, in, the, southeastern, part, of, the, desert, candelilla, euphorbia, antisyphilitica, mimosa, zygophylla, acacia, glandulifera, and, lechuguilla, are, found, in, areas, with, well, draining, shallow, soils, the, shrubs, found, near, the, sierra, madre, oriental, are, exclusively, lechuguilla, guapilla, hechtia, glomerata, queen, victoria, s, agave, agave, victoriae, reginae, sotol, dasylirion, spp, and, barreta, helietta, parvifolia, while, the, well, developed, herbaceous, layer, includes, grasses, legumes, and, cacti, desert, or, arid, grasslands, comprise, 20, of, this, desert, and, are, often, mosaics, of, shrubs, and, grasses, they, include, purple, three, awn, aristida, purpurea, black, grama, bouteloua, eriopoda, and, sideoats, grama, bouteloua, curtipendula, early, spanish, explorers, reported, encountering, grasses, that, were, belly, high, to, a, horse, most, likely, these, were, big, alkali, sacaton, sporobolus, wrightii, and, tobosa, pleuraphis, mutica, along, floodplain, or, bottomland, areas, the, united, nations, environment, programme, reported, in, 2006, that, nearly, half, of, the, bird, mammal, and, butterfly, species, in, the, chihuahuan, desert, are, expected, to, be, replaced, by, other, species, by, 2055, due, to, climate, change, a, 2017, assessment, found, that, 35, 905, km, 2, 13, 863, sq, mi, or, 7, of, the, ecoregion, is, in, protected, areas, protected,
