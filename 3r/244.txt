the, 2008, greenlandic, self, government, referendum, greenlanders, voted, for, the, self, government, act, which, transferred, more, power, from, the, danish, government, to, the, local, naalakkersuisut, greenlandic, government, under, this, structure, greenland, gradually, assumed, responsibility, for, a, number, of, governmental, services, and, areas, of, competence, the, danish, government, retains, control, of, citizenship, monetary, policy, and, foreign, affairs, including, defence, most, residents, of, greenland, are, inuit, the, population, is, concentrated, mainly, on, the, southwest, coast, and, the, rest, of, the, island, is, sparsely, populated, three, quarters, of, greenland, is, covered, by, the, only, permanent, ice, sheet, outside, antarctica, with, a, population, of, 56, 583, 2022, greenland, is, the, least, densely, populated, region, in, the, world, sixty, seven, percent, of, its, electricity, production, comes, from, renewable, energy, mostly, from, hydropower, the, early, norse, settlers, named, the, island, greenland, in, the, icelandic, sagas, the, norwegian, erik, the, red, was, exiled, from, iceland, with, his, father, thorvald, who, had, committed, manslaughter, with, his, extended, family, and, his, thralls, slaves, or, serfs, he, set, out, in, ships, to, explore, an, icy, land, known, to, lie, to, the, northwest, after, finding, a, habitable, area, and, settling, there, he, named, it, gr, nland, translated, as, greenland, supposedly, in, the, hope, that, the, pleasant, name, would, attract, settlers, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, states, in, the, summer, erik, left, to, settle, in, the, country, he, had, found, which, he, called, greenland, as, he, said, people, would, be, attracted, there, if, it, had, a, favorable, name, the, name, of, the, territory, in, the, greenlandic, language, is, kalaallit, nunaat, land, of, the, kalaallit, the, kalaallit, are, the, greenlandic, inuit, who, inhabit, the, territory, s, western, region, in, world, war, ii, the, united, states, military, used, bluie, as, a, code, name, for, greenland, where, they, kept, several, bases, named, bluie, east, or, west, sequential, numeral, in, prehistoric, times, greenland, was, home, to, several, successive, paleo, inuit, cultures, known, today, primarily, through, archaeological, finds, the, earliest, entry, of, the, paleo, inuit, into, greenland, is, thought, to, have, occurred, about, 2500, bc, from, about, 2500, bc, to, 800, bc, southern, and, western, greenland, was, inhabited, by, the, saqqaq, culture, most, finds, of, remains, from, that, period, have, been, around, disko, bay, including, the, site, of, saqqaq, for, which, the, culture, is, named, from, 2400, bc, to, 1300, bc, the, independence, i, culture, existed, in, northern, greenland, it, was, a, part, of, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, towns, including, deltaterrasserne, appeared, about, 800, bc, the, saqqaq, culture, disappeared, and, the, early, dorset, culture, emerged, in, western, greenland, and, the, independence, ii, culture, in, northern, greenland, the, dorset, culture, was, the, first, culture, to, extend, throughout, the, greenlandic, coastal, areas, in, the, west, and, the, east, it, lasted, until, the, total, onset, of, the, thule, culture, in, ad, 1500, the, people, of, the, dorset, culture, lived, mainly, by, hunting, whales, and, reindeer, from, 986, the, west, coast, was, settled, by, icelanders, and, norwegians, through, a, contingent, of, 14, boats, led, by, erik, the, red, they, formed, three, settlements, the, eastern, settlement, the, western, settlement, and, the, middle, settlement, on, fjords, near, the, southwestern, tip, of, the, island, they, shared, the, island, with, the, late, dorset, culture, inhabitants, who, occupied, the, northern, and, western, parts, and, later, with, those, of, the, thule, culture, who, entered, from, the, north, norse, greenlanders, submitted, to, norwegian, rule, in, 1261, under, the, kingdom, of, norway, the, kingdom, of, norway, entered, a, personal, union, with, denmark, in, 1380, and, from, 1397, was, a, part, of, the, kalmar, union, the, norse, settlements, such, as, brattahl, thrived, for, centuries, before, disappearing, in, the, 15th, century, perhaps, at, the, onset, of, the, little, ice, age, except, some, runic, inscriptions, the, only, contemporary, records, or, historiography, that, survives, from, the, norse, settlements, is, of, their, contact, with, iceland, or, norway, medieval, norwegian, sagas, and, historical, works, mention, greenland, s, economy, the, bishops, of, gardar, and, the, collection, of, tithes, a, chapter, in, the, konungs, skuggsj, the, king, s, mirror, describes, norse, greenland, s, exports, imports, and, grain, cultivation, icelandic, saga, accounts, of, life, in, greenland, were, composed, in, the, 13th, century, and, later, and, are, not, primary, sources, for, the, history, of, early, norse, greenland, those, accounts, are, closer, to, primary, for, more, contemporaneous, accounts, of, late, norse, greenland, modern, understanding, therefore, mostly, depends, on, the, physical, data, from, archeological, sites, interpretation, of, ice, core, and, clam, shell, data, suggests, that, between, ad, 800, and, 1300, the, regions, around, the, fjords, of, southern, greenland, had, a, relatively, mild, climate, several, degrees, celsius, warmer, than, usual, in, the, north, atlantic, with, trees, and, herbaceous, plants, growing, and, livestock, being, farmed, barley, was, grown, as, a, crop, up, to, the, 70th, parallel, the, ice, cores, show, that, greenland, has, had, dramatic, temperature, shifts, many, times, in, the, past, 100, 000, years, similarly, the, icelandic, book, of, settlements, records, famines, during, the, winters, in, which, the, old, and, helpless, were, killed, and, thrown, over, cliffs, these, norse, settlements, vanished, during, the, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, the, demise, of, the, western, settlement, coincides, with, a, decrease, in, summer, and, winter, temperatures, a, study, of, north, atlantic, seasonal, temperature, variability, during, the, little, ice, age, showed, a, significant, decrease, in, maximum, summer, temperatures, beginning, about, the, turn, of, the, 14th, century, as, much, as, 6, to, 8, c, 11, to, 14, f, lower, than, modern, summer, temperatures, the, study, also, found, that, the, lowest, winter, temperatures, of, the, last, 2, 000, years, occurred, in, the, late, 14th, century, and, early, 15th, century, the, eastern, settlement, was, probably, abandoned, in, the, early, to, mid, 15th, century, during, this, cold, period, theories, drawn, from, archeological, excavations, at, herjolfsnes, in, the, 1920s, suggest, that, the, condition, of, human, bones, from, this, period, indicates, that, the, norse, population, was, malnourished, possibly, because, of, soil, erosion, resulting, from, the, norsemen, s, destruction, of, natural, vegetation, in, the, course, of, farming, turf, cutting, and, wood, cutting, malnutrition, may, also, have, resulted, from, widespread, deaths, from, pandemic, plague, the, decline, in, temperatures, during, the, little, ice, age, and, armed, conflicts, with, the, skr, lings, norse, word, for, inuit, meaning, wretches, recent, archeological, studies, somewhat, challenge, the, general, assumption, that, the, norse, colonization, had, a, dramatic, negative, environmental, effect, on, the, vegetation, data, support, traces, of, a, possible, norse, soil, amendment, strategy, more, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, norse, who, never, numbered, more, than, about, 2, 500, gradually, abandoned, the, greenland, settlements, over, the, 15th, century, as, walrus, ivory, the, most, valuable, export, from, greenland, decreased, in, price, because, of, competition, with, other, sources, of, higher, quality, ivory, and, that, there, was, actually, little, evidence, of, starvation, or, difficulties, other, explanations, of, the, disappearance, of, the, norse, settlements, have, been, proposed, the, thule, people, are, the, ancestors, of, the, current, greenlandic, population, no, genes, from, the, paleo, inuit, have, been, found, in, the, present, population, of, greenland, the, thule, culture, migrated, eastward, from, what, is, now, known, as, alaska, around, 1000, ad, reaching, greenland, around, 1300, the, thule, culture, was, the, first, to, introduce, to, greenland, such, technological, innovations, as, dog, sleds, and, toggling, harpoons, there, is, an, account, of, contact, and, conflict, with, the, norse, population, as, told, by, the, inuit, it, is, republished, in, the, norse, atlantic, sagas, by, gwyn, jones, jones, reports, that, there, is, also, an, account, of, perhaps, the, same, incident, of, more, doubtful, provenance, told, by, the, norse, side, in, 1500, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, sent, gaspar, corte, real, to, greenland, in, search, of, a, northwest, passage, to, asia, which, according, to, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, part, of, portugal, s, sphere, of, influence, in, 1501, corte, real, returned, with, his, brother, miguel, corte, real, finding, the, sea, frozen, they, headed, south, and, arrived, in, labrador, and, newfoundland, upon, the, brothers, return, to, portugal, the, cartographic, information, supplied, by, corte, real, was, incorporated, into, a, new, map, of, the, world, which, was, presented, to, ercole, i, d, este, duke, of, ferrara, by, alberto, cantino, in, 1502, the, cantino, planisphere, made, in, lisbon, accurately, depicts, the, southern, coastline, of, greenland, in, 1605, 1607, king, christian, iv, of, denmark, and, norway, sent, a, series, of, expeditions, to, greenland, and, arctic, waterways, to, locate, the, lost, eastern, norse, settlement, and, assert, danish, norwegian, sovereignty, over, greenland, the, expeditions, were, mostly, unsuccessful, partly, due, to, leaders, who, lacked, experience, with, the, difficult, arctic, ice, and, weather, conditions, and, partly, because, the, expedition, leaders, were, given, instructions, to, search, for, the, eastern, settlement, on, the, east, coast, of, greenland, just, north, of, cape, farewell, which, is, almost, inaccessible, due, to, southward, drifting, ice, the, pilot, on, all, three, trips, was, english, explorer, james, hall, after, the, norse, settlements, died, off, greenland, came, under, the, de, facto, control, of, various, inuit, groups, but, the, dano, norwegian, government, never, forgot, or, relinquished, the, claims, to, greenland, that, it, had, inherited, from, the, norse, when, it, re, established, contact, with, greenland, in, the, early, 17th, century, denmark, norway, asserted, its, sovereignty, over, the, island, in, 1721, a, joint, mercantile, and, clerical, expedition, led, by, dano, norwegian, missionary, hans, egede, was, sent, to, greenland, not, knowing, whether, a, norse, civilization, remained, there, this, expedition, is, part, of, the, dano, norwegian, colonization, of, the, americas, after, 15, years, in, greenland, hans, egede, left, his, son, paul, egede, in, charge, of, the, mission, there, and, returned, to, denmark, where, he, established, a, greenland, seminary, this, new, colony, was, centred, at, godth, b, good, hope, on, the, southwest, coast, gradually, greenland, was, opened, up, to, danish, merchants, but, closed, to, those, from, other, countries, when, the, union, between, the, crowns, of, denmark, and, norway, was, dissolved, in, 1814, the, treaty, of, kiel, severed, norway, s, former, colonies, and, left, them, under, the, control, of, the, danish, monarch, norway, occupied, then, uninhabited, eastern, greenland, as, erik, the, red, s, land, in, july, 1931, claiming, that, it, constituted, terra, nullius, norway, and, denmark, agreed, to, submit, the, matter, in, 1933, to, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, which, decided, against, norway, greenland, s, connection, to, denmark, was, severed, on, 9, april, 1940, early, in, world, war, ii, after, denmark, was, occupied, by, nazi, germany, on, 8, april, 1941, the, united, states, occupied, greenland, to, defend, it, against, a, possible, invasion, by, germany, the, united, states, occupation, of, greenland, continued, until, 1945, greenland, was, able, to, buy, goods, from, the, united, states, and, canada, by, selling, cryolite, from, the,

collapse, of, the, third, reich, albert, speer, briefly, considered, escaping, in, a, small, aeroplane, to, hide, out, in, greenland, but, changed, his, mind, and, decided, to, surrender, to, the, united, states, armed, forces, greenland, had, been, a, protected, and, very, isolated, society, until, 1940, the, danish, government, had, maintained, a, strict, monopoly, of, greenlandic, trade, allowing, no, more, than, small, scale, barter, trading, with, british, whalers, in, wartime, greenland, developed, a, sense, of, self, reliance, through, self, government, and, independent, communication, with, the, outside, world, despite, this, change, in, 1946, a, commission, including, the, highest, greenlandic, council, the, landsr, dene, recommended, patience, and, no, radical, reform, of, the, system, two, years, later, the, first, step, towards, a, change, of, government, was, initiated, when, a, grand, commission, was, established, a, final, report, g, 50, was, presented, in, 1950, which, recommended, the, introduction, of, a, modern, welfare, state, with, denmark, s, development, as, sponsor, and, model, in, 1953, greenland, was, made, an, equal, part, of, the,

greenland, and, in, 1946, offered, to, buy, the, island, from, denmark, for, 100, 000, 000, the, danish, rejected, the, offer, in, the, 21st, century, the, united, states, remains, interested, in, investing, in, the, resource, base, of, greenland, and, in, tapping, hydrocarbons, off, the, greenlandic, coast, in, august, 2019, the, us, again, proposed, to, buy, the, country, prompting, premier,

greenlandification, during, this, period, the, danish, government, promoted, the, exclusive, use, of, the, danish, language, in, official, matters, and, required, greenlanders, to, go, to, denmark, for, their, post, secondary, education, many, greenlandic, children, grew, up, in, boarding, schools, in, southern, denmark, and, a, number, lost, their, cultural, ties, to, greenland, while, the, policies, succeeded, in, the, sense, of, shifting, greenlanders, from, being, primarily, subsistence, hunters, into, being, urbanized, wage, earners, the, greenlandic, elite, began, to, reassert, a, greenlandic, cultural, identity, a, movement, developed, in, favour, of, independence, reaching, its, peak, in, the, 1970s, as, a, consequence, of, political, complications, in, relation, to, denmark, s, entry, into, the, european, common, market, in, 1972, denmark, began, to, seek, a, different, status, for, greenland, resulting, in, the, home, rule, act, of, 1979, this, gave, greenland, limited, autonomy, with, its, own, legislature, taking, control, of, some, internal, policies, while, the, parliament, of, denmark, maintained, full, control, of, external, policies, security, and, natural,

survey, led, by, french, scientist, paul, emile, victor, in, 1951, concluded, that, under, the, ice, sheet, greenland, is, composed, of, three, large, islands, this, is, disputed, but, if, it, is, so, they, would, be, separated, by, narrow, straits, reaching, the, sea, at, ilulissat, icefjord, at, greenland, s, grand, canyon, and, south, of, nordostrundingen, all, towns, and, settlements, of, greenland, are, situated, along, the, ice, free, coast, with, the, population, being, concentrated, along, the, west, coast, the, northeastern, part, of, greenland, is, not, part, of, any, municipality, but, it, is, the, site, of, the, world, s, largest, national, park, northeast, greenland, national, park, at, least, four, scientific, expedition, stations, and, camps, had, been, established, on, the, ice, sheet, in, the, ice, covered, central, part, of, greenland, indicated, as, pale, blue, in, the, adjacent, map, eismitte, north, ice, north, grip, camp, and, the, raven, skiway, there, is, a, year, round, station, summit, camp, on, the, ice, sheet, established, in, 1989, the, radio, station, j, rgen, br, nlund, fjord, was, until, 1950, the, northernmost, permanent, outpost, in, the, world, the, extreme, north, of, greenland, peary, land, is, not, covered, by, an, ice, sheet, because, the, air, there, is, too, dry, to, produce, snow, which, is, essential, in, the, production, and, maintenance, of, an, ice, sheet, if, the, greenland, ice, sheet, were, to, melt, away, completely, the, world, s, sea, level, would, rise, by, more, than, 7, m, 23, ft, in, 2003, a, small, island, 35, m, 15, m, 115, ft, 49, ft, in, length, and, width, was, discovered, by, arctic, explorer, dennis, schmitt, and, his, team, at, the, coordinates, of, 83, 42, whether, this, island, is, permanent, is, not, yet, confirmed, if, it, is, it, is, the, northernmost, permanent, known, land, on, earth, in, 2007, the, existence, of, a, new, island, was, announced, named, uunartoq, qeqertaq, english, warming, island, this, island, has, always, been, present, off, the, coast, of, greenland, but, was, covered, by, a, glacier, this, glacier, was, discovered, in, 2002, to, be, shrinking, rapidly, and, by, 2007, had, completely, melted, away, leaving, the, exposed, island, the, island, was, named, place, of, the, year, by, the, oxford, atlas, of, the, world, in, 2007, ben, keene, the, atlas, s, editor, commented, in, the, last, two, or, three, decades, global, warming, has, reduced, the, size, of, glaciers, throughout, the, arctic, and, earlier, this, year, news, sources, confirmed, what, climate, scientists, already, knew, water, not, rock, lay, beneath, this, ice, bridge, on, the, east, coast, of, greenland, more, islets, are, likely, to, appear, as, the, sheet, of, frozen, water, covering, the, world, s, largest, island, continues, to, melt, some, controversy, surrounds, the, history, of, the, island, specifically, over, whether, the, island, might, have, been, revealed, during, a, brief, warm, period, in, greenland, during, the, mid, 20th, century, greenland, ice, sheet, always, loses, some, mass, from, ice, calving, at, its, coasts, but, it, used, to, gain, more, ice, on, average, due, to, the, accumulation, of, snowfall, yet, greenland, has, been, warming, starting, from, around, 1900, and, starting, from, 1980s, the, losses, became, larger, than, the, gains, after, 1996, greenland, has, not, had, a, single, year, when, it, did, not, lose, mass, on, average, in, 2010s, greenland, ice, sheet, had, been, melting, at, its, fastest, rate, over, at, least, the, past, 12, 000, years, and, on, track, to, exceed, that, later, in, the, century, in, 2012, 2019, and, 2021, so, called, massive, melting, events, had, occurred, when, practically, the, entire, surface, of, the, ice, sheet, had, been, melting, and, no, accumulation, had, been, taking, place, during, the, 2021, event, rain, fell, at, greenland, s, highest, point, for, the, first, time, in, recorded, history, an, event, so, unexpected, that, the, research, station, at, the, summit, had, no, rain, gauges, for, the, occasion, as, with, the, ice, losses, elsewhere, the, melting, of, greenland, contributes, to, sea, level, rise, between, 2012, and, 2017, this, melting, had, added, an, average, of, 0, 68, mm, per, year, which, was, equivalent, to, 37, of, sea, level, rise, from, land, ice, sources, excluding, thermal, expansion, of, water, from, the, continual, increase, in, the, ocean, heat, content, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, melting, of, greenland, alone, would, add, between, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, if, the, temperatures, are, kept, below, 2, c, 3, 6, f, to, around, 13, cm, 5, in, if, the, most, intense, climate, change, scenario, with, ever, increasing, greenhouse, gas, emissions, is, followed, 1302, under, this, scenario, the, worst, case, for, greenland, melting, could, reach, 33, cm, 13, in, of, sea, level, rise, equivalent, the, large, quantities, of, fresh, meltwater, also, affect, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, or, amoc, by, diluting, key, currents, slowing, it, down, due, to, this, meltwater, input, the, circulation, may, even, collapse, outright, with, widespread, detrimental, effects, although, research, suggests, this, is, only, likely, if, highest, possible, warming, is, sustained, for, multiple, centuries, greenland, ice, sheet, has, a, great, volume, of, 2, 900, 000, cubic, kilometres, 696, 000, cu, mi, this, means, that, if, it, were, all, to, melt, the, global, sea, levels, would, increase, by, 7, 4, m, 24, ft, from, that, alone, however, it, also, means, that, it, will, take, at, least, 1, 000, years, for, the, ice, sheet, to, disappear, even, with, very, high, warming, and, in, around, 10, 000, years, under, lower, warming, which, still, crosses, the, threshold, for, the, ice, sheet, s, disappearance, this, threshold, likely, lies, for, the, global, warming, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 2, 3, c, 4, 1, f, reducing, the, warming, back, to, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, above, preindustrial, levels, or, lower, i, e, through, large, scale, carbon, dioxide, removal, would, arrest, the, losses, but, still, cause, greater, ultimate, sea, level, rise, than, if, the, threshold, had, never, been, exceeded, further, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, itself, appears, to,
