the, harbor, britain, responded, with, a, series, of, punitive, laws, stripping, massachusetts, of, self, government, which, the, colonists, called, the, intolerable, acts, these, confrontations, led, to, the, first, battles, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, in, 1775, and, the, expulsion, of, the, british, authorities, from, the, region, in, spring, 1776, the, region, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, movement, to, abolish, slavery, in, the, united, states, and, it, was, the, first, region, of, the, u, s, transformed, by, the, industrial, revolution, initially, centered, on, the, blackstone, and, merrimack, river, valleys, the, physical, geography, of, new, england, is, diverse, southeastern, new, england, is, covered, by, a, narrow, coastal, plain, while, the, western, and, northern, regions, are, dominated, by, the, rolling, hills, and, worn, down, peaks, of, the, northern, end, of, the, appalachian, mountains, the, atlantic, fall, line, lies, close, to, the, coast, which, enabled, numerous, cities, to, take, advantage, of, water, power, along, the, many, rivers, such, as, the, connecticut, river, which, bisects, the, region, from, north, to, south, each, state, is, generally, subdivided, into, small, municipalities, known, as, towns, many, of, which, are, governed, by, town, meetings, unincorporated, areas, are, practically, nonexistent, outside, of, maine,

only, multi, state, region, with, clear, and, consistent, boundaries, it, maintains, a, strong, sense, of, cultural, identity, although, the, terms, of, this, identity, are, often, contrasted, combining, puritanism, with, liberalism, agrarian, life, with, industry, and, isolation, with, immigration, the, earliest, known, inhabitants, of, new, england, were, american, indians, who, spoke, a, variety, of, the, eastern, algonquian, languages, prominent, tribes, included, the, abenakis, mi, kmaq, penobscot, pequots, mohegans, narragansetts, nipmucs, pocumtucks, and, wampanoags, prior, to, the, arrival, of, european, colonists, the, western, abenakis, inhabited, what, is, now, new, hampshire, new, york, and, vermont, as, well, as, parts, of, quebec, and, western, maine, their,

linguistically, and, politically, as, early, as, the, year, 1600, french, dutch, and, english, traders, began, exploring, the, new, world, trading, metal, glass, and, cloth, for, local, beaver, pelts, on, april, 10, 1606, king, james, i, of, england, issued, a, charter, for, the, virginia, company, which, consisted, of, the, london, company, and, the, plymouth, company, these, two, privately, funded, ventures, were, intended, to, claim, land, for, england, to, conduct, trade, and, to, return, a, profit, in, 1620, the, pilgrims, arrived, on, the, mayflower, and, established, plymouth, colony, in, massachusetts, beginning, the, history, of, permanent, european, colonization, in, new, england, in, 1616, english, explorer, john, smith, named, the, region, new, england, the, name, was, officially, sanctioned, on, november, 3, 1620, when, the, charter, of, the, virginia, company, of, plymouth, was, replaced, by, a, royal, charter, for, the, plymouth, council, for, new, england, a, joint, stock, company, established, to, colonize, and, govern, the, region, the, pilgrims, wrote, and, signed, the, mayflower, compact, before, leaving, the, ship, and, it, became, their, first, governing, document, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, came, to, dominate, the, area, and, was, established, by, royal, charter, in, 1629, with, its, major, town, and, port, of, boston, established, in, 1630, massachusetts, puritans, began, to, establish, themselves, in, connecticut, as, early, as, 1633, roger, williams, was, banished, from, massachusetts, for, theological, reasons, he, led, a, group, south, where, they, founded, providence, plantations, which, grew, into, the, colony, of, rhode, island, and, providence, plantations, in, 1636, at, this, time, vermont, was, uncolonized, and, the, territories, of, new, hampshire, and, maine, were, claimed, and, governed, by, massachusetts, as, the, region, grew, it, received, many, immigrants, from, europe, due, to, its, religious, tolerance, and, economy, relationships, alternated, between, peace, and, armed, skirmishes, between, colonists, and, local, native, american, tribes, the, bloodiest, of, which, was, the, pequot, war, in, 1637, which, resulted, in, the, mystic, massacre, on, may, 19, 1643, the, colonies, of, massachusetts, bay, plymouth, new, haven, and, connecticut, joined, in, a, loose, compact, called, the, new, england, confederation, officially, the, united, colonies, of, new, england, the, confederation, was, designed, largely, to, coordinate, mutual, defense, and, it, gained, some, importance, during, king, philip, s, war, which, pitted, the, colonists, and, their, indian, allies, against, a, widespread, indian, uprising, from, june, 1675, through, april, 1678, resulting, in, killings, and, massacres, on, both, sides, in, the, aftermath, of, settler, native, conflicts, hundreds, of, captive, indians, were, sold, into, slavery, up, until, 1700, native, americans, comprised, a, majority, of, the, non, white, labor, force, in, colonial, new, england, during, the, next, 74, years, there, were, six, colonial, wars, that, took, place, primarily, between, new, england, and, new, france, during, which, new, england, was, allied, with, the, iroquois, confederacy, and, new, france, was, allied, with, the, wabanaki, confederacy, mainland, nova, scotia, came, under, the, control, of, new, england, after, the, siege, of, port, royal, 1710, but, both, new, brunswick, and, most, of, maine, remained, contested, territory, between, new, england, and, new, france, the, british, eventually, defeated, the, french, in, 1763, opening, the, connecticut, river, valley, for, british, settlement, into, western, new, hampshire, and, vermont, the, new, england, colonies, were, settled, primarily, by, farmers, who, became, relatively, self, sufficient, later, new, england, s, economy, began, to, focus, on, crafts, and, trade, aided, by, the, puritan, work, ethic, in, contrast, to, the, southern, colonies, which, focused, on, agricultural, production, while, importing, finished, goods, from, england, by, 1686, king, james, ii, had, become, concerned, about, the, increasingly, independent, ways, of, the, colonies, including, their, self, governing, charters, their, open, flouting, of, the, navigation, acts, and, their, growing, military, power, he, therefore, established, the, dominion, of, new, england, an, administrative, union, including, all, of, the, new, england, colonies, in, 1688, the, former, dutch, colonies, of, new, york, east, new, jersey, and, west, new, jersey, were, added, to, the, dominion, the, union, was, imposed, from, the, outside, and, contrary, to, the, rooted, democratic, tradition, of, the, colonies, and, it, was, highly, unpopular, among, the, colonists, the, dominion, significantly, modified, the, charters, of, the, colonies, including, the, appointment, of, royal, governors, to, nearly, all, of, them, there, was, an, uneasy, tension, among, the, royal, governors, their, officers, and, the, elected, governing, bodies, of, the, colonies, the, governors, wanted, unlimited, authority, and, the, different, layers, of, locally, elected, officials, would, often, resist, them, in, most, cases, the, local, town, governments, continued, operating, as, self, governing, bodies, just, as, they, had, before, the, appointment, of, the, governors, after, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1689, bostonians, overthrew, the, royal, governor, sir, edmund, andros, during, a, popular, and, bloodless, uprising, they, seized, dominion, officials, and, adherents, to, the, church, of, england, these, tensions, eventually, culminated, in, the, american, revolution, boiling, over, with, the, outbreak, of, the, war, of, american, independence, in, 1775, the, first, battles, of, which, were, fought, in, lexington, and, concord, massachusetts, leading, to, the, siege, of, boston, by, continental, troops, in, march, 1776, british, forces, were, compelled, to, retreat, from, boston, after, the, dissolution, of, the, dominion, of, new, england, the, colonies, of, new, england, ceased, to, function, as, a, unified, political, unit, but, remained, a, defined, cultural, region, there, were, often, disputes, over, territorial, jurisdiction, leading, to, land, exchanges, such, as, those, regarding, the, equivalent, lands, and, new, hampshire, grants, by, 1784, all, of, the, states, in, the, region, had, taken, steps, towards, the, abolition, of, slavery, with, vermont, and, massachusetts, introducing, total, abolition, in, 1777, and, 1783, respectively, the, nickname, yankeeland, was, sometimes, used, to, denote, the, new, england, area, especially, among, southerners, and, the, british, vermont, was, admitted, to, statehood, in, 1791, after, settling, a, dispute, with, new, york, the, territory, of, maine, had, been, a, part, of, massachusetts, but, it, was, granted, statehood, on, march, 15, 1820, as, part, of, the, missouri, compromise, today, new, england, is, defined, as, the, six, states, of, maine, vermont, new, hampshire, massachusetts, rhode, island, and, connecticut, new, england, s, economic, growth, relied, heavily, on, trade, with, the, british, empire, and, the, region, s, merchants, and, politicians, strongly, opposed, trade, restrictions, as, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, fought, the, war, of, 1812, new, england, federalists, organized, the, hartford, convention, in, the, winter, of, 1814, to, discuss, the, region, s, grievances, concerning, the, war, and, to, propose, changes, to, the, united, states, constitution, to, protect, the, region, s, interests, and, maintain, its, political, power, radical, delegates, within, the, convention, proposed, the, region, s, secession, from, the, united, states, but, they, were, outnumbered, by, moderates, who, opposed, the, idea, politically, the, region, often, disagreed, with, the, rest, of, the, country, massachusetts, and, connecticut, were, among, the, last, refuges, of, the, federalist, party, and, new, england, became, the, strongest, bastion, of, the, new, whig, party, when, the, second, party, system, began, in, the, 1830s, the, whigs, were, usually, dominant, throughout, new, england, except, in, the, more, democratic, maine, and, new, hampshire, new, england, was, key, to, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, united, states, the, blackstone, valley, running, through, massachusetts, and, rhode, island, has, been, called, the, birthplace, of, america, s, industrial, revolution, in, 1787, the, first, cotton, mill, in, america, was, founded, in, the, north, shore, seaport, of, beverly, massachusetts, as, the, beverly, cotton, manufactory, the, manufactory, was, also, considered, the, largest, cotton, mill, of, its, time, technological, developments, and, achievements, from, the, manufactory, led, to, the, development, of, more, advanced, cotton, mills, including, slater, mill, in, pawtucket, rhode, island, towns, such, as, lawrence, massachusetts, lowell, massachusetts, woonsocket, rhode, island, and, lewiston, maine, became, centers, of, the, textile, industry, following, the, innovations, at, slater, mill, and, the, beverly, cotton, manufactory, the, connecticut, river, valley, became, a, crucible, for, industrial, innovation, particularly, the, springfield, armory, pioneering, such, advances, as, interchangeable, parts, and, the, assembly, line, which, influenced, manufacturing, processes, all, around, the, world, from, early, in, the, nineteenth, century, until, the, mid, twentieth, the, region, surrounding, springfield, massachusetts, and, hartford, connecticut, served, as, the, united, states, epicenter, for, advanced, manufacturing, drawing, skilled, workers, from, all, over, the, world, the, rapid, growth, of, textile, manufacturing, in, new, england, between, 1815, and, 1860, caused, a, shortage, of, workers, recruiters, were, hired, by, mill, agents, to, bring, young, women, and, children, from, the, countryside, to, work, in, the, factories, between, 1830, and, 1860, thousands, of, farm, girls, moved, from, rural, areas, where, there, was, no, paid, employment, to, work, in, the, nearby, mills, such, as, the, lowell, mill, girls, as, the, textile, industry, grew, immigration, also, grew, by, the, 1850s, immigrants, began, working, in, the, mills, especially, french, canadians, and, irish, new, england, as, a, whole, was, the, most, industrialized, part, of, the, united, states, by, 1850, the, region, accounted, for, well, over, a, quarter, of, all, manufacturing, value, in, the, country, and, over, a, third, of, its, industrial, workforce, it, was, also, the, most, literate, and, most, educated, region, in, the, country, during, the, same, period, new, england, and, areas, settled, by, new, englanders, upstate, new, york, ohio, s, western, reserve, and, the, upper, midwestern, states, of, michigan, and, wisconsin, were, the, center, of, the, strongest, abolitionist, and, anti, slavery, movements, in, the, united, states, coinciding, with, the, protestant, great, awakening, in, the, region, abolitionists, who, demanded, immediate, emancipation, had, their, base, in, the, region, such, as, william, lloyd, garrison, john, greenleaf, whittier, and, wendell, phillips, so, too, did, anti, slavery, politicians, who, wanted, to, limit, the, growth, of, slavery, such, as, john, quincy, adams, charles, sumner, and, john, p, hale, the, anti, slavery, republican, party, was, formed, in, the, 1850s, and, all, of, new, england, became, strongly, republican, including, areas, that, had, previously, been, strongholds, for, both, the, whig, and, the, democratic, parties, new, england, remained, solidly, republican, until, catholics, began, to, mobilize, behind, the, democrats, especially, in, 1928, this, led, to, the, end, of, yankee, republicanism, and, began, new, england, s, relatively, swift, transition, into, a, consistently, democratic, stronghold, in, national, elections, the, flow, of, immigrants, continued, at, a, steady, pace, from, the, 1840s, until, cut, off, by, world, war, i, the, largest, numbers, came, from, ireland, and, britain, before, 1890, and, after, that, from, quebec, italy, and, southern, europe, the, immigrants, filled, the, ranks, of, factory, workers, craftsmen, and, unskilled, laborers, the, irish, and, italians, assumed, a, larger, and, larger, role, in, the, democratic, party, in, the, cities, and, statewide, while, the, rural, areas, remained, republican, the, great, depression, in, the, united, states, of, the, 1930s, hit, the, region, hard, with, high, unemployment, in, the, industrial, cities, the, boston, stock, exchange, rivaled, the, new, york, stock, exchange, in, 1930, in, the, beginning, of, 1930, john, c, hull, first, securities, director, of, massachusetts, 1930, 1936, helped, to, mitigate, the, consequences, of, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, and, the, great, depression, he, was, helpful, in, the, passing, of, the, securities, exchange, act, of, 1934, with, his, war, on, unlisted, securities, hull, gave, testimony, to, the, us, senate, sen, duncan, upshaw, fletcher, for, work, on, the, pecora, commission, which, revealed, that, neither, albert, h, wiggin, born, in, medfield,

workers, and, especially, catholics, pulling, them, into, the, new, deal, coalition, and, making, the, once, republican, region, into, one, that, was, closely, divided, however, the, enormous, spending, on, munitions, ships, electronics, and, uniforms, during, world, war, ii, caused, a, burst, of, prosperity, in, every, sector, the, region, lost, most, of, its, factories, starting, with, the, loss, of, textiles, in, the, 1930s, and, getting, worse, after, 1960, the, new, england, economy, was, radically, transformed, after, world, war, ii, the, factory, economy, practically, disappeared, once, bustling, new, england, communities, fell, into, economic, decay, following, the, flight, of, the, region, s, industrial, base, the, textile, mills, one, by, one, went, out, of, business, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1970s, for, example, the, crompton, company, went, bankrupt, in, 1984, after, 178, years, in, business, costing, the, jobs, of, 2, 450, workers, in, five, states, the, major, reasons, were, cheap, imports, the, strong, dollar, declining, exports, and, a, failure, to, diversify, the, shoe, industry, subsequently, left, the, region, as, well, what, remains, is, very, high, technology, manufacturing, such, as, jet, engines, nuclear, submarines, pharmaceuticals, robotics, scientific, instruments, and, medical, devices, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, invented, the, format, for, university, industry, relations, in, high, tech, fields, and, spawned, many, software, and, hardware, firms, some, of, which, grew, rapidly, by, the, 21st, century, the, region, had, become, famous, for, its, leadership, roles, in, the, fields, of, education, medicine, medical, research, high, technology, finance, and, tourism, some, industrial, areas, were, slow, in, adjusting, to, the, new, service, economy, in, 2000, new, england, had, two, of, the, ten, poorest, cities, in, the, u, s, by, percentage, living, below, the, poverty, line, the, state, capitals, of, providence, rhode, island, and, hartford, connecticut, they, were, no, longer, in, the, bottom, ten, by, 2010, connecticut, massachusetts, and, new, hampshire, remain, among, the, ten, wealthiest, states, in, the, united, states, in, terms, of, median, household, income, and, per, capita, income, the, states, of, new, england, have, a, combined, area, including, water, surfaces, of, 71, 988, square, miles, 186, 447, km, 2, making, the, region, slightly, larger, than, the, state, of, washington, and, slightly, smaller, than, great, britain, maine, alone, constitutes,
