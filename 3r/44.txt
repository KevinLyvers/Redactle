exploration, risk, maximum, burial, of, and, primary, gas, migration, from, the, source, rocks, could, have, terminated, as, early, as, the, jurassic, whereas, many, of, the, tilted, fault, blocks, were, reactivated, or, created, during, paleogene, inversion, of, the, basin, however, it, is, also, possible, that, a, secondary, gas, charge, occurred, during, regional, heating, associated, with, intrusion, of, paleogene, dykes, such, as, those, that, crop, out, nearby, on, the, coastline, of, north, wales, floodpage, et, al, 1999, have, invoked, this, second, phase, of, paleogene, hydrocarbon, generation, as, an, important, factor, in, the, charging, of, the, east, irish, sea, basin, s, oil, and, gas, fields, it, is, not, clear, as, yet, whether, aeromagnetic, anomalies, in, the, southeast, of, caernarfon, bay, are, imaging, a, continuation, of, the, dyke, swarm, into, this, area, too, or, whether, they, are, instead, associated, with, deeply, buried, permian, syn, rift, volcanics, alternatively, the, fault, block, traps, could, have, been, recharged, by, exsolution, of, methane, from, formation, brines, as, a, direct, result, of, the, tertiary, uplift, cf, dor, and, jensen, 1996, the, cardigan, bay, basin, forms, a, continuation, into, british, waters, of, ireland, s, north, celtic, sea, basin, which, has, two, producing, gas, fields, the, basin, comprises, a,

marine, sandstones, and, limestone, great, oolite, and, upper, jurassic, fluvial, sandstone, the, reservoir, for, the, dragon, discovery, the, most, likely, hydrocarbon, source, rocks, are, early, jurassic, marine, mudstones, these, are, fully, mature, for, oil, generation, in, the, west, of, the, british, sector, and, are, mature, for, gas, generation, nearby, in, the, irish, sector, gas, prone, westphalian, pre, rift, coal, measures, may, also, be, present, at, depth, locally, the, cardigan, bay, basin, was, subjected, to, two, tertiary, phases, of, compressive, uplift, whereas, maximum, burial, that, terminated, primary, hydrocarbon, generation, was, probably, around, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, or, earlier, if, cretaceous, strata, now, missing, were, never, deposited, in, the, basin, despite, the, tertiary, structuration, the, dragon, discovery, has, proved, that, potentially, commercial, volumes, of, hydrocarbons, were, retained, at, least, locally, in, cardigan, bay, in, addition, to, undrilled, structural, traps, the, basin, contains, the, untested, potential, for, stratigraphic, entrapment, of, hydrocarbons, near, synsedimentary, faults, especially, in,

in, place, this, undrilled, prospect, still, has, significant, risk, and, the, partners, are, currently, advancing, a, focused, work, programme, in, order, to, better, understand, and, hopefully, mitigate, these, risks, however, given, its, location, in, shallow, water, and, close, proximity, to, shore, the, prospect, is, of, great, interest, as, exploration, drilling, together, with, any, future, development, costs, are, likely, to, be, low, below, is, a, list, of, cities, and, towns, around, the, irish, sea, coasts, in, order, of, size, the, most, accessible, and, possibly, the, greatest, wildlife, resource, of, the, irish, sea, lies, in, its, estuaries, particularly, the, dee, estuary, the, mersey, estuary, the, ribble, estuary, morecambe, bay, the, solway, firth, the, firth, of, clyde, belfast, lough, strangford, lough, carlingford, lough, dundalk, bay, dublin, bay, and, wexford, harbour, however, a, lot, of, wildlife, also, depends, on, the, cliffs, salt, marshes, and, sand, dunes, of, the, adjoining, shores, the, seabed, and, the, open, sea, itself, the, information, on, the, invertebrates, of, the, seabed, of, the, irish, sea, is, rather, patchy, because, it, is, difficult, to, survey, such, a, large, area, where, underwater, visibility, is, often, poor, and, information, often, depends, upon, looking, at, material, brought, up, from, the, seabed, in, mechanical, grabs, however, the, groupings, of, animals, present, depend, to, a, large, extent, on, whether, the, seabed, is, composed, of, rock, boulders, gravel, sand, mud, or, even, peat, in, the, soft, sediments, seven, types, of, community, have, been, provisionally, identified, variously, dominated, by, brittle, stars, sea, urchins, worms, mussels, tellins, furrow, shells, and, tower, shells, parts, of, the, bed, of, the, irish, sea, are, very, rich, in, wildlife, the, seabed, southwest, of, the, isle, of, man, is, particularly, noted, for, its, rarities, and, diversity, as, are, the, horse, mussel, beds, of, strangford, lough, scallops, and, queen, scallops, are, found, in, more, gravelly, areas, in, the, estuaries, where, the, bed, is, more, sandy, or, muddy, the, number, of, species, is, smaller, but, the, size, of, their, populations, is, larger, brown, shrimp, cockles, and, edible, mussels, support, local, fisheries, in, morecambe, bay, and, the, dee, estuary, and, the, estuaries, are, also, important, as, nurseries, for, flatfish, herring, and, sea, bass, muddy, seabeds, in, deeper, waters, are, home, to, populations, of, the, dublin, bay, prawn, also, known, as, scampi, the, open, sea, is, a, complex, habitat, in, its, own, right, it, exists, in, three, spatial, dimensions, and, also, varies, over, time, and, tide, for, example, where, freshwater, flows, into, the, irish, sea, in, river, estuaries, its, influence, can, extend, far, offshore, as, the, freshwater, is, lighter, and, floats, on, top, of, the, much, larger, body, of, salt, water, until, wind, and, temperature, changes, mix, it, in, similarly, warmer, water, is, less, dense, and, seawater, warmed, in, the, inter, tidal, zone, may, float, on, the, colder, offshore, water, the, amount, of, light, penetrating, the, seawater, also, varies, with, depth, and, turbidity, this, leads, to, differing, populations, of, plankton, in, different, parts, of, the, sea, and, varying, communities, of, animals, that, feed, on, these, populations, however, increasing, seasonal, storminess, leads, to, greater, mixing, of, water, and, tends, to, break, down, these, divisions, which, are, more, apparent, when, the, weather, is, calm, for, long, periods, plankton, includes, bacteria, plants, phytoplankton, and, animals, zooplankton, that, drift, in, the, sea, most, are, microscopic, but, some, such, as, the, various, species, of, jellyfish, and, sea, gooseberry, can, be, much, bigger, diatoms, and, dinoflagellates, dominate, the, phytoplankton, although, they, are, microscopic, plants, diatoms, have, hard, shells, and, dinoflagellates, have, little, tails, that, propel, them, through, the, water, phytoplankton, populations, in, the, irish, sea, have, a, spring, bloom, every, april, and, may, when, the, seawater, is, generally, at, its, greenest, crustaceans, especially, copepods, dominate, the, zooplankton, however, many, animals, of, the, seabed, the, open, sea, and, the, seashore, spend, their, juvenile, stages, as, part, of, the, zooplankton, the, whole, plankton, soup, is, vitally, important, directly, or, indirectly, as, a, food, source, for, most, species, in, the, irish, sea, even, the, largest, the, enormous, basking, shark, for, example, lives, entirely, on, plankton, and, the, leatherback, turtle, s, main, food, is, jellyfish, a, colossal, diversity, of, invertebrate, species, live, in, the, irish, sea, and, its, surrounding, coastline, ranging, from, flower, like, fan, worms, to, predatory, swimming, crabs, to, large, chameleon, like, cuttlefish, some, of, the, most, significant, for, other, wildlife, are, the, reef, building, species, like, the, inshore, horse, mussel, of, strangford, lough, the, inter, tidal, honeycomb, worm, of, morecambe, bay, cumbria, and, lancashire, and, the, sub, tidal, honeycomb, worm, of, the, wicklow, reef, these, build, up, large, structures, over, many, years, and, in, turn, provide, surfaces, nooks, and, crannies, where, other, marine, animals, and, plants, may, become, established, and, live, out, some, or, all, of, their, lives, there, are, quite, regular, records, of, live, and, stranded, leatherback, turtles, in, and, around, the, irish, sea, this, species, travels, north, to, the, waters, off, the, british, isles, every, year, following, the, swarms, of, jellyfish, that, form, its, prey, loggerhead, turtle, ridley, sea, turtle, and, green, turtle, are, found, very, occasionally, in, the, irish, sea, but, are, generally, unwell, or, dead, when, discovered, they, have, strayed, or, been, swept, out, of, their, natural, range, further, south, into, colder, waters, the, estuaries, of, the, irish, sea, are, of, international, importance, for, birds, they, are, vital, feeding, grounds, on, migration, flyways, for, shorebirds, travelling, between, the, arctic, and, africa, others, depend, on, the, milder, climate, as, a, refuge, when, continental, europe, is, in, the, grip, of, winter, twenty, one, species, of, seabird, are, reported, as, regularly, nesting, on, beaches, or, cliffs, around, the, irish, sea, huge, populations, of, the, sea, duck, common, scoter, spend, winters, feeding, in, shallow, waters, off, eastern, ireland, lancashire, and, north, wales, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, all, frequent, the, irish, sea, but, knowledge, of, how, many, there, may, be, and, where, they, go, is, somewhat, sketchy, about, a, dozen, species, have, been, recorded, since, 1980, but, only, three, are, seen, fairly, often, these, are, the, harbour, porpoise, bottlenose, dolphin, and, common, dolphin, the, more, rarely, seen, species, are, minke, whale, fin, whale, sei, whale, humpback, whale, north, atlantic, right, whales, which, are, now, considered, to, be, almost, extinct, in, eastern, north, atlantic, sperm, whale, northern, bottlenose, whale, long, finned, pilot, whale, orca, white, beaked, dolphin, striped, dolphin, and, risso, s, dolphin, in, 2005, a, plan, to, reintroduce, grey, whales, by, airlifting, 50, of, them, from, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, irish, sea, was, claimed, to, be, logically, and, ethically, feasible, it, has, not, been, implemented, as, of, 2013, the, common, or, harbour, seal, and, the, grey, seal, are, both, resident, in, the, irish, sea, common, seals, breed, in, strangford, lough, grey, seals, in, southwest, wales, and, in, small, numbers, on, the, isle, of, man, grey, seals, haul, out, but, do, not, breed, off, hilbre, and, walney, islands, merseyside, the, wirral, st, annes, barrow, in, furness, borough, and, cumbria, the, irish, sea, has, been, described, by, greenpeace, as, the, most, radioactively, contaminated, sea, in, the, world, with, some, eight, million, litres, of, nuclear, waste, discharged, into, it, each, day, from, sellafield, reprocessing, plants, contaminating, seawater, sediments, and, marine, life, low, level, radioactive, waste, has, been, discharged, into, the, irish, sea, as, part, of, operations, at, sellafield, since, 1952, the, rate, of, discharge, began, to, accelerate, in, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, reaching, a, peak, in, the, 1970s, and, generally, declining, significantly, since, then, as, an, example, of, this, profile, discharges, of, plutonium, specifically, 241, pu, peaked, in, 1973, at, 2, 755, terabecquerels, 74, 500, ci, falling, to, 8, 1, tbq, 220, ci, by, 2004, improvements, in, the, treatment, of, waste, in, 1985, and, 1994, resulted, in, further, reductions, in, radioactive, waste, discharge, although, the, subsequent, processing, of, a, backlog, resulted, in, increased, discharges, of, certain, types, of, radioactive, waste, discharges, of, technetium, in, particular, rose, from, 6, 1, tbq, 160, ci, in, 1993, to, a, peak, of, 192, tbq, 5, 200, ci, in, 1995, before, dropping, back, to, 14, tbq, 380, ci, in, 2004, in, total, 22, petabecquerels, 590, kci, of, 241, pu, was, discharged, over, the, period, 1952, to, 1998, current, rates, of, discharge, for, many, radionuclides, are, at, least, 100, times, lower, than, they, were, in, the, 1970s, analysis, of, the, distribution, of, radioactive, contamination, after, discharge, reveals, that, mean, sea, currents, result, in, much, of, the, more, soluble, elements, such, as, caesium, being, flushed, out, of, the, irish, sea, through, the, north, channel, about, a, year, after, discharge, measurements, of, technetium, concentrations, post, 1994, has, produced, estimated, transit, times, to, the, north, channel, of, around, six, months, with, peak, concentrations, off, the, northeast, irish, coast, occurring, 18, 24, months, after, peak, discharge, less, soluble, elements, such, as, plutonium, are, subject, to, much, slower, redistribution, whilst, concentrations, have, declined, in, line, with, the, reduction, in, discharges, they, are, markedly, higher, in, the, eastern, irish, sea, compared, to, the, western, areas, the, dispersal,

tunnel, project, has, been, discussed, several, times, in, the, irish, parliament, the, idea, for, a, 34, kilometre, 21, mi, long, rail, bridge, or, tunnel, continues, to, be, mooted, several, potential, projects, have, been, proposed, including, one, between, dublin, and, holyhead, put, forward, in, 1997, by, the, british, engineering, firm, symonds, at, 80, km, 50, mi, it, would, have, been, by, far, the, longest, rail, tunnel, on, earth, with, an, estimated, cost, approaching, 20, billion, an, offshore, wind, farm, was, developed, on, the, arklow, bank, arklow, bank, wind, park,
