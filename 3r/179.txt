upper, niger, river, were, connected, to, each, other, and, formed, a, single, river, flowing, from, east, to, west, which, they, called, the, western, nile, in, fact, some, of, the, headwaters, of, the, senegal, river, are, near, the, niger, river, in, mali, and, guinea, it, was, believed, to, be, either, a, western, branch, of, the, egyptian, nile, river, or, drawn, from, the, same, source, variously, conjectured, to, some, great, internal, lakes, of, the, mountains, of, the, moon, or, ptolemy, s, gir, or, the, biblical, gihon, stream, arab, geographers, abd, al, hassan, ali, ibn, omar,

producing, ghana, empire, and, later, the, mali, empire, trans, saharan, traders, gave, the, senegal, its, famous, nickname, as, the, river, of, gold, the, trans, saharan, stories, about, the, river, of, gold, reached, the, ears, of, sub, alpine, european, merchants, that, frequented, the, ports, of, morocco, and, the, lure, proved, irresistible, arab, historians, report, at, least, three, separate, arab, maritime, expeditions, the, last, one, organized, by, a, group, of, eight, mughrarin, wanderers, of, lisbon, before, 1147, that, tried, to, sail, down, the, atlantic, coast, possibly, in, an, effort, find, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, drawing, from, classical, legend, and, arab, sources, the, river, of, gold, found, its, way, into, european, maps, in, the, 14th, century, in, the, hereford, mappa, mundi, c, 1300, there, is, a, river, labelled, nilus, fluvius, drawn, parallel, to, the, coast, of, africa, albeit, without, communication, with, atlantic, it, ends, in, a, lake, it, depicts, some, giant, ants, digging, up, gold, dust, from, its, sands, with, the, note, hic, grandes, formice, auream, serican, arenas, here, great, ants, guard, gold, sands, in, the, mappa, mundi, made, by, pietro, vesconte, for, the, c, 1320, atlas, of, marino, sanuto, there, is, an, unnamed, river, stemming, from, the, african, interior, and, opening, in, the, atlantic, ocean, the, 1351, medici, laurentian, atlas, shows, both, the, egyptian, nile, and, the, western, nile, stemming, from, the, same, internal, mountain, range, with, the, note, that, ilic, coligitur, aureaum, the, portolan, chart, of, giovanni, da, carignano, 1310s, 20s, has, the, river, with, the, label, iste, fluuis, exit, de, nilo, ubi, multum, aurum, repperitur, in, the, more, accurately, drawn, portolan, charts, starting, with, the, 1367, chart, of, domenico, and, francesco, pizzigano, and, carried, on, in, the, 1375, catalan, atlas, the, 1413, chart, of, the, catalan, converso, mecia, de, viladestes, etc, the, river, of, gold, is, depicted, if, only, speculatively, draining, into, the, atlantic, ocean, somewhere, just, south, of, cape, bojador, the, legend, of, cape, bojador, as, a, terrifying, obstacle, the, cape, of, no, return, to, european, sailors, emerged, around, the, same, time, possibly, encouraged, by, trans, saharan, traders, who, did, not, want, to, see, their, land, route, sidestepped, by, sea, the, river, is, frequently, depicted, with, a, great, river, island, midway, the, island, of, gold, first, mentioned, by, al, masudi, and, famously, called, wangara, by, al, idrisi, and, palolus, in, the, 1367, pizzigani, brothers, chart, it, is, conjectured, that, this, riverine, island, is, in, fact, just, the, bambuk, bur, goldfield, district, which, is, practically, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, rivers, the, senegal, river, to, the, north, the, fal, m, river, to, the, west, the, bakhoy, to, the, east, and, the, niger, and, tinkisso, to, the, south, the, 1413, portolan, chart, of, mecia, de, viladestes, gives, perhaps, the, most, detailed, depiction, of, the, early, state, of, european, knowledge, about, the, senegal, river, prior, to, the, 1440s, viladestes, labels, it, river, of, gold, riu, del, or, and, locates, it, a, considerable, distance, south, of, cape, bojador, buyeter, indeed, south, of, a, mysterious, cap, de, abach, possibly, cape, timris, there, are, extensive, notes, about, the, plentifulness, of, ivory, and, gold, in, the, area, including, a, note, that, reads, this, river, is, called, wad, al, nil, and, also, is, called, the, river, of, gold, for, one, can, here, obtain, the, gold, of, palolus, and, know, that, the, greater, part, of, those, that, live, here, occupy, themselves, collecting, gold, on, the, shores, of, the, river, which, at, its, mouth, is, a, league, wide, and, deep, enough, for, the, largest, ship, of, the, world, the, galley, of, jaume, ferrer, is, depicted, off, the, coast, on, the, left, with, a, quick, note, about, his, 1346, voyage, the, golden, round, island, at, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, is, the, indication, customary, on, portolan, charts, of, river, mouth, bars, or, islands, in, this, case, probably, a, reference, to, the, langue, de, barbarie, or, the, island, of, saint, louis, the, first, town, by, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, is, called, isingan, arguably, the, etymological, source, of, the, term, senegal, east, of, that, the, senegal, forms, a, riverine, island, called, insula, de, bronch, le, morfil, by, its, shores, lies, the, city, of, tocoror, takrur, above, it, is, a, depiction, of, the, almoravid, general, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, rex, bubecar, on, a, camel, further, east, along, the, river, is, the, seated, emperor, mansa, of, mali, rex, musa, meli, prob, mansa, musa, holding, a, gold, nugget, his, capital, civitat, musa, meli, is, shown, on, the, shores, of, the, river, and, the, range, of, the, emperor, of, mali, s, sway, is, suggested, by, all, the, black, banners, an, inscription, notes, this, lord, of, the, blacks, is, called, musa, melli, lord, of, guinea, the, greatest, noble, lord, of, these, parts, for, the, abundance, of, the, gold, which, is, collected, in, his, lands, curiously, there, is, a, defiant, gold, bannered, town, south, of, the, river, labelled, tegezeut, probably, the, ta, adjast, of, al, idrisi, and, might, be, an, ichoate, reference, to, djenn, east, of, mali, the, river, forms, a, lake, or, island, of, gold, shown, here, studded, with, river, washed, gold, nuggets, this, is, what, the, pizzigani, brothers, called, the, island, of, palolus, and, most, commentators, take, to, indicate, the, bambuk, bur, goldfields, it, is, connected, by, many, streams, to, the, southerly, mountains, of, gold, labelled, montanies, del, lor, the, futa, djallon, bambouk, mountains, and, loma, mountains, of, sierra, leone, it, is, evident, the, senegal, river, morphs, east, unbroken, into, the, niger, river, the, cities, of, tenbuch, timbuktu, geugeu, gao, and, mayna, niamey, or, a, misplaced, niani, are, denoted, along, the, same, single, river, south, of, them, barely, visible, are, what, seem, like, the, towns, of, kukiya, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, island, of, gold, and, east, of, that, probably, sokoto, called, zogde, in, the, catalan, atlas, and, much, further, southeast, probably, kano, north, of, the, senegal, niger, are, the, various, oases, and, stations, of, the, trans, saharan, route, tutega, tijigja, anzica, in, zize, tegaza, taghaza, etc, towards, the, mediterranean, coast, there, is, an, unlabeled, depiction, of, a, black, african, man, on, a, camel, traveling, from, uuegar, prob, hoggar, to, the, town, of, organa, ciutat, organa, variously, identified, as, kanem, or, ouargla, or, possibly, even, a, misplaced, depiction, of, ghana, long, defunct, but, on, the, other, hand, contemporaneous, with, the, depicted, abu, bakr, nearby, sits, its, arab, looking, king, rex, organa, holding, a, scimitar, the, river, of, gold, is, sourced, at, a, circular, island, what, seem, like, the, mountains, of, the, moon, albeit, unlabeled, here, from, this, same, source, also, flows, north, the, white, nile, towards, egypt, which, forms, the, frontier, between, the, muslim, king, of, nubia, rex, onubia, his, range, depicted, by, crescent, on, gold, banners, and, the, christian, prester, john, preste, joha, i, e, the, emperor, of, ethiopia, in, the, garb, of, a, christian, bishop, coincidentally, this, is, the, first, visual, depiction, of, prester, john, on, a, portolan, chart, uniquely, the, viladestes, map, shows, another, river, south, of, the, senegal, which, it, labels, the, flumen, gelica, poss, angelica, which, some, have, taken, to, depict, the, gambia, river, in, the, 1459, mappa, mundi, of, fra, mauro, drawn, a, half, century, later, after, the, portuguese, had, already, visited, the, senegal, albeit, still, trying, to, respect, classical, sources, shows, two, parallel, rivers, running, east, to, west, both, of, them, sourced, from, the, same, great, internal, lake, which, fra, mauro, asserts, is, also, the, same, source, as, the, egyptian, nile, mauro, names, the, two, parallel, rivers, differently, calling, one, flumen, mas, mas, river, the, other, the, canal, dal, oro, channel, of, gold, and, makes, the, note, that, inne, larena, de, questi, do, fiume, se, trova, oro, de, paiola, in, the, sands, of, both, these, rivers, gold, of, palola, may, be, found, and, nearer, to, the, sea, qui, se, racoce, oro, here, gold, is, collected, and, finally, on, the, coast, terra, de, palmear, land, of, palms, it, is, notable, that, fra, mauro, knew, of, the, error, of, henry, the, navigator, s, captains, about, the, daklha, inlet, which, mauro, carefully, labels, reodor, rio, do, ouro, western, sahara, distinctly, from, the, canal, del, oro, senegal, river, christian, europeans, soon, began, attempting, to, find, the, sea, route, to, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, the, first, known, effort, may, have, been, by, the, genoese, brothers, vandino, and, ugolino, vivaldi, who, set, out, down, the, coast, in, 1291, in, a, pair, of, ships, nothing, more, is, heard, of, them, in, 1346, the, majorcan, sailor, jaume, ferrer, set, out, on, a, galley, with, the, explicit, objective, of, finding, the, river, of, gold, riu, de, l, or, where, he, heard, that, most, people, along, its, shores, were, engaged, in, the, collection, of, gold, and, that, the, river, was, wide, and, deep, enough, for, the, largest, ships, nothing, more, is, heard, of, him, either, in, 1402, after, establishing, the, first, european, colony, on, the, canary, islands, the, french, norman, adventurers, jean, de, b, thencourt, and, gadifer, de, la, salle, set, about, immediately, probing, the, african, coast, looking, for, directions, to, the, mouth, of, senegal, the, project, of, finding, the, senegal, was, taken, up, in, the, 1420s, by, the, portuguese, prince, henry, the, navigator, who, invested, heavily, to, reach, it, in, 1434, one, of, henry, s, captains, gil, eanes, finally, surpassed, cape, bojador, and, returned, to, tell, about, it, henry, immediately, dispatched, a, follow, up, mission, in, 1435, under, gil, eanes, and, afonso, gon, alves, baldaia, going, down, the, coast, they, turned, around, the, al, dakhla, peninsula, in, the, western, sahara, and, emerged, into, an, inlet, which, they, excitedly, believed, to, be, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, the, name, they, mistakenly, bestowed, upon, the, inlet, rio, do, ouro, is, a, name, it, would, remain, stuck, with, down, to, the, 20th, century, realizing, the, mistake, henry, kept, pressing, his, captains, further, down, the, coast, and, in, 1445, the, portuguese, captain, nuno, trist, o, finally, reached, the, langue, de, barbarie, where, he, noticed, the, desert, end, and, the, treeline, begin, and, the, population, change, from, tawny, sanhaja, berbers, to, black, wolof, people, bad, weather, or, lack, of, supplies, prevented, trist, o, from, actually, reaching, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, but, he, rushed, back, to, portugal, to, report, he, had, finally, found, the, land, of, the, blacks, terra, dos, negros, and, that, the, nile, was, surely, nearby, shortly, after, possibly, still, within, that, same, year, another, captain, dinis, dias, sometimes, given, as, dinis, fernandes, was, the, first, known, european, since, antiquity, to, finally, reach, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, however, dias, did, not, sail, upriver, but, instead, kept, sailing, down, the, grande, c, te, to, the, bay, of, dakar, the, very, next, year, in, 1446, the, portuguese, slave, raiding, fleet, of, lan, arote, de, freitas, arrived, at, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, one, of, its, captains, est, v, o, afonso, volunteered, to, take, a, launch, to, explore, upriver, for, settlements, thus, becoming, the, first, european, to, actually, enter, the, senegal, river, he, didn, t, get, very, far, venturing, ashore, at, one, point, along, the, river, bank, afonso, tried, to, kidnap, two, wolof, children, from, a, woodsman, s, hut, but, he, ran, into, their, father, who, proceeded, to, chase, the, portuguese, back, to, their, launch, and, gave, them, such, a, beating, that, the, explorers, gave, up, on, going, any, further, and, turned, back, to, the, waiting, caravels, sometime, between, 1448, and, 1455, the, portuguese, captain, louren, o, dias, opened, regular, trade, contact, on, the, senegal, river, with, the, wolof, statelets, of, waalo, near, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, and, cayor, a, little, below, that, drumming, up, a, profitable, business, exchanging, mediterranean, goods, notably, horses, for, gold, and, slaves, chronicler, gomes, eanes, de, zurara, writing, in, 1453, still, called, it, the, nile, river, but, alvise, cadamosto, writing, in, the, 1460s, was, already, calling, it, the, senega, and, it, is, denoted, as, rio, do, anag, on, most, subsequent, portuguese, maps, of, the, age, cadamosto, relates, the, legend, that, both, the, senegal, and, the, egyptian, nile, were, branches, of, the, biblical, gihon, river, that, stems, from, the, garden, of, eden, and, flows, through, ethiopia, he, also, notes, that, the, senegal, was, called, the, niger, by, the, ancients, probably, a, reference, to, ptolemy, s, legendary, nigir, below, the, gir, which, would, be, later, identified, by, leo, africanus, with, the, modern, niger, river, much, the, same, story, is, repeated, by, marmol, in, 1573, with, the, additional, note, that, both, the, senegal, river, and, gambia, river, were, tributaries, of, the, niger, river, however, the, contemporary, african, atlas, of, venetian, cartographer, livio, sanuto, published, in, 1588, sketches, the, senegal, the, niger, and, the, gambia, as, three, separate, parallel, rivers, portuguese, chronicler, jo, o, de, barros, writing, in, 1552, says, the, river, s, original, local, wolof, name, was, ovedech, which, according, to, one, source, comes, from, vi, dekh, wolof, for, this, river, his, contemporary, dami, o, de, g, is, 1567, records, it, as, sonedech, from, sunu, dekh, wolof, for, our, river, writing, in, 1573, the, spanish, geographer, luis, del, marmol, carvajal, asserts, that, the, portuguese, called, it, zenega, the, zeneges, berber, zenaga, called, it, the, zenedec, the, gelofes, wolofs, call, it, dengueh, the, tucorones, fula, toucouleur, called, it, mayo, the, aragoles, soninke, sarakole, of, ngalam, called, it, colle, and, further, along, again, marmol, assuming, senegal, was, connected, to, the, niger, the, people, of, bagamo, bambara, of, bamako, called, it, zimbala, jimbala, and, the, people, of, timbuktu, called, it, the, y, a, the, 16th, century, chronicler, jo, o, de, barros, asserts, the, portuguese, renamed, it, senegal, because, that, was, the, personal, name, of, a, local, wolof, chieftain, who, frequently, conducted, business, with, the, portuguese, traders, but, this, etymology, is, doubtful, e, g, the, ruler, of, senegalese, river, state, of, waalo, bears, the, title, brak, and, cadamosto, gives, the, personal, name, of, the, senegal, river, chieftain, as, zucholin, the, confusion, may, have, arisen, because, cadamosto, says, the, portuguese, interacted, frequently, with, a, certain, wolof, chieftain, south, of, the, river, somewhere, on, the, grande, c, te, which, he, refers, to, as, budomel, budomel, is, almost, certainly, a, reference, to, the, ruler, of, cayor, a, combination, of, his, formal, title, damel, prefixed, by, the, generic, wolof, term, bor, lord, curiously, budomel, is, reminiscent, of, vedamel, already, used, by, the, genoese, back, in, the, 14th, century, as, an, alternative, name, of, the, senegal, river, it, is, almost, certain, that, the, genoese, vedamel, are, corruptions, from, the, arabic, either, wad, al, mal, river, of, treasure, i, e, gold, or, alternatively, wad, al, melli, river, of, mali, or, even, by, transcription, error, wad, al, nill, river, of, nile, other, etymological, theories, for, senegal, abound, a, popular, one, first, proposed, by, fr, david, boilat, 1853, was, that, senegal, comes, from, the, wolof, phrase, sunu, gaal, meaning, our, canoe, more, precisely, our, pirogue, bailot, speculates, the, name, probably, arose, as, a, misunderstanding, that, when, a, portuguese, captain, came, across, some, wolof, fishermen, and, asked, them, what, the, name, of, the, river, was, they, believed, he, was, asking, who, their, fishing, boat, belonged, to, and, replied, simply, it, is, our, canoe, sunu, gaal, the, our, canoe, theory, has, been, popularly, embraced, in, modern, senegal, for, its, charm, and, appeal, to, national, solidarity, we, re, all, in, one, canoe, etc, more, recent, historians, suggest, the, name, senegal, is, probably, a, derivation, of, azenegue, the, portuguese, term, for, the, saharan, berber, zenaga, people, that, lived, north, of, it, a, strong, challenge, to, this, theory, is, that, senegal, is, much, older, and, might, derive, from, sanghana, also, given, as, isenghan, asengan, singhanah, a, city, described, by, the, arab, historian, al, bakri, in, 1068, as, located, by, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, straddling, both, banks, and, the, capital, of, a, local, kingdom, the, location, senegany, is, depicted, in, 1351, genoese, map, known, as, the, medici, atlas, laurentian, gaddiano, portolan, this, town, isingan, is, fantastically, depicted, in, the, 1413, portolan, map, of, majorcan, cartographer, mecia, de, viladestes, the, name, itself, might, be, of, berber, zenaga, origin, speculatively, related, to, ismegh, black, slave, analogous, to, the, arabic, abd, or, sagui, nughal, border, some, sources, claim, isinghan, remained, the, usual, berber, term, to, refer, to, the, wolof, kingdom, of, cayor, some, serer, people, from, the, south, have, advanced, the, claim, that, the, river, s, name, is, originally, derived, from, the, compound, of, the, serer, term, sene, from, rog, sene, supreme, deity, in, serer, religion, and, o, gal, meaning, body, of, water, 15, 47, 17, n, 16, 31, 44, w, 15, 78806, n, 16, 52889, w, 15, 78806, 16, 52889
