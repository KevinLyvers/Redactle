the, carpathian, mountains, or, carpathians, k, r, p, e, i, n, z, are, a, range, of, mountains, forming, an, arc, across, central, europe, and, southeast, europe, roughly, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, long, it, is, the, third, longest, european, mountain, range, after, the, urals, at, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, and, the, scandinavian, mountains, at, 1, 700, km, 1, 100, mi, the, range, stretches, from, the, far, eastern, czech, republic, 3, and, austria, 1, in, the, northwest, through, slovakia, 21, poland, 10, ukraine, 10, romania, 50, to, serbia, 5, in, the, south, the, highest, range, within, the, carpathians, is, known, as, the, tatra, mountains, in, poland, and, slovakia, where, the, highest, peaks, exceed, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, the, second, highest, range, is, the, southern, carpathians, in, romania, where, the, highest, peaks, range, between, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, and, 2, 550, m, 8, 370, ft, the, divisions, of, the, carpathians, usually, involve, three, major, sections, the, term, outer, carpathians, is, frequently, used, to, describe, the, northern, rim, of, the, western, and, eastern, carpathians, the, carpathians, provide, habitat, for, the, largest, european, populations, of, brown, bears, wolves, chamois, and, lynxes, with, the, highest, concentration, in, romania, as, well, as, over, one, third, of, all, european, plant, species, the, mountains, and, their, foothills, also, have, many, thermal, and, mineral, waters, with, romania, having, one, third, of, the, european, total, romania, is, likewise, home, to, the, second, largest, area, of, virgin, forests, in, europe, after, russia, totaling, 250, 000, hectares, 65, most, of, them, in, the, carpathians, with, the, southern, carpathians, constituting, europe, s, largest, unfragmented, forest, area, deforestation, rates, due, to, illegal, logging, in, the, carpathians, are, high, in, modern, times, the, range, is, called, karpaty, in, czech, polish, and, slovak, and, karpaty, in, ukrainian, karpati, in, serbo, croatian, carpa, i, in, romanian, in, rusyn, karpaten, german, pronunciation, in, german, and, k, rp, tok, in, hungarian, although, the, toponym, was, recorded, by, ptolemy, in, the, second, century, ad, the, modern, form, of, the, name, is, a, neologism, in, most, languages, for, instance, havasok, snowy, mountains, was, its, medieval, hungarian, name, russian, chronicles, referred, to, it, as, hungarian, mountains, later, sources, such, as, dimitrie, cantemir, and, the, italian, chronicler, giovanandrea, gromo, referred, to, the, range, as, transylvania, s, mountains, while, the, 17th, century, historian, constantin, cantacuzino, translated, the, name, of, the, mountains, in, an, italian, romanian, glossary, to, rumanian, mountains, the, name, carpates, is, highly, associated, with, the, old, dacian, tribes, called, carpes, or, carpi, who, lived, in, an, area, to, the, east, of, the, carpathians, from, the, east, northeast, of, the, black, sea, to, the, transylvanian, plain, in, the, present, day, romania, and, moldova, karpates, is, considered, a, paleo, balkan, name, with, evidence, provided, by, the, albanian, k, rp, k, rpa, pl, k, rpa, k, rpat, rock, stiff, and, the, messapic, karpa, tuff, rock, limestone, preserved, as, c, rp, tuff, in, bitonto, dialect, and, c, rparu, limestone, in, salentino, this, connection, is, further, supported, by, the, fact, that, also, the, oronym, beskydy, a, series, of, mountain, ranges, in, the, carpathians, has, a, meaning, in, albanian, bjeshk, bjeshk, t, high, mountains, mountain, pastures, cf, also, the, albanian, oronym, bjeshk, t, e, namuna, the, accursed, mountains, albanian, alps, the, name, carpates, may, ultimately, be, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, sker, ker, which, meant,

late, roman, documents, the, eastern, carpathian, mountains, were, referred, to, as, montes, sarmatici, meaning, sarmatian, mountains, the, western, carpathians, were, called, carpates, a, name, that, is, first, recorded, in, ptolemy, s, geographia, second, century, ad, in, the, scandinavian, hervarar, saga, which, relates, ancient, germanic, legends, about, battles, between, goths, and, huns, the,

mountains, thorchal, tarczal, or, less, frequently, montes, nivium, snowy, mountains, the, northwestern, carpathians, begin, in, slovakia, and, southern, poland, they, surround, transcarpathia, and, transylvania, in, a, large, semicircle, sweeping, towards, the, southeast, and, end, on, the, danube, near, or, ova, in, romania, the, total, length, of, the, carpathians, is, over, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, the, mountain, chain, s, width, varies, between, 12, and, 500, km, 7, and, 311, mi, the, highest, altitudes, of, the, carpathians, occur, where, they, are, widest, the, system, attains, its, greatest, breadth, in, the, transylvanian, plateau, and, in, the, southern, tatra, mountains, group, the, highest, range, in, which, gerlachovsk, t, t, in, slovakia, is, the, highest, peak, is, 2,

although, commonly, referred, to, as, a, mountain, chain, the, carpathians, do, not, form, an, uninterrupted, chain, of, mountains, rather, they, consist, of, several, orographically, and, geologically, distinctive, groups, presenting, as, great, a, structural, variety, as, the, alps, the, carpathians, which, attain, an, altitude, over, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, in, only, a, few, places, lack, the, bold, peaks, extensive, snowfields, large, glaciers, high, waterfalls, and, numerous, large, lakes, that, are, common, in, the, alps, it, was, believed, that, no, area, of, the, carpathian, range, was, covered, in, snow, all, year, round, and, there, were, no, glaciers, but, recent, research, by, polish, scientists, discovered, one, permafrost, and, glacial, area, in, the, tatra, mountains, the, carpathians, at, their, highest, altitude, are, only, as, high, as, the, middle, region, of, the, alps, with, which, they, share, a, common, appearance, climate, and, flora, the, carpathians, are, separated, from, the, alps, by, the, danube, the, two, ranges, meet, at, only, one, point, the, leitha, mountains, at, bratislava, the, river, also, separates, them, from, the, balkan, mountains, at, or, ova, in, romania, the, valley, of, the, march, and, oder, separates, the, carpathians, from, the, silesian, and, moravian, chains, which, belong, to, the, middle, wing, of, the, great, central, mountain, system, of, europe, unlike, the, other, wings, of, the, system, the, carpathians, which, form, the, watershed, between, the, northern, seas, and, the, black, sea, are, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, plains, the, pannonian, plain, is, to, the, southwest, the, lower, danubian, plain, to, the, south, with, the, southern, part, being, in, bulgaria, and, the, northern, in, romania, and, the, galician, plain, to, the, northeast, important, cities, and, towns, in, or, near, the, carpathians, are, in, approximate, descending, order, of, population, this, is, an, incomplete, list, of, the, peaks, of, the, carpathians, having, summits, over, 2, 500, metres, 8, 200, ft, with, their, heights, geologic, divisions, and, locations, this, is, a, list, of, the, highest, national, peaks, of, the, carpathians, their, heights, geologic, divisions, and, locations, excluding, mountains, located, in, two, countries, on, the, border, in, the, romanian, part, of, the, main, chain, of, the, carpathians, mountain, passes, include, prislop, pass, tihu, a, pass, bicaz, canyon, ghime, pass, buz, u, pass, predeal, pass, crossed, by, the, railway, from, bra, ov, to,

both, crossed, by, the, railway, from, timi, oara, to, craiova, the, area, now, occupied, by, the, carpathians, was, once, occupied, by, smaller, ocean, basins, the, carpathian, mountains, were, formed, during, the, alpine, orogeny, in, the, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, by, moving, the, alcapa, alpine, carpathian, pannonian, tisza, and, dacia, plates, over, subducting, oceanic, crust, the, mountains, take, the, form, of, a, fold, and, thrust, belt, with, generally, north, vergence, in, the, western, segment, northeast, to, east, vergence, in, the, eastern, portion, and, southeast, vergence, in, the, southern, portion, currently, the, area, is, the, most, seismically, active, in, central, europe, the, external, generally, northern, portion, of, the, orogenic, belt, is, a, tertiary, accretionary, wedge, of, a, so, called, flysch, belt, the, carpathian, flysch, belt, created, by, rocks, scraped, off, the, sea, bottom, and, thrust, over, the, north, european, plate, the, carpathian, accretionary, wedge, is, made, of, several, thin, skinned, nappes, composed, of, cretaceous, to, paleogene, turbidites, thrusting, of, the, flysch, nappes, over, the, carpathian, foreland, caused, the, formation, of, the, carpathian, foreland, basin, the, boundary, between, the, flysch, belt, and, internal, zones, of, the, orogenic, belt, in, the, western, segment, of, the, mountain, range, is, marked, by, the, pieniny, klippen, belt, a, narrow, complicated, zone, of, polyphase, compressional, deformation, later, involved, in, a, supposed, strike, slip, zone, internal, zones, in, western, and, eastern, segments, contain, older, variscan, igneous, massifs, reworked, in, mesozoic, thick, and, thin, skinned, nappes, during, the, middle, miocene, this, zone, was, affected, by, intensive, calc, alkaline, arc, volcanism, that, developed, over, the, subduction, zone, of, the, flysch, basins, at, the, same, time, the, internal, zones, of, the, orogenic, belt, were, affected, by, large, extensional, structure, of, the, back, arc, pannonian, basin, the, last, volcanic, activity, occurred, at, ciomadul, about, 30, 000, years, ago, the, mountains, started, to, gain, their, current, shape, from, the, latest, miocene, onward, the, slopes, of, the, carphartian, contain, at, some, locations, solifluction, deposits, iron, gold, and, silver, were, found, in, great, quantities, in, the, western, carpathians, after, the, roman, emperor, trajan, s, conquest, of, dacia, he, brought, back, to, rome, over, 165, tons, of, gold, and, 330, tons, of, silver, the, ecology, of, the, carpathians, varies, with, altitude, ranging, from, lowland, forests, to, alpine, meadows, foothill, forests, are, primarily, of, broadleaf, deciduous, trees, including, oak, hornbeam, and, linden, european, beech, is, characteristic, of, the, montane, forest, zone, higher, elevation, subalpine, forests, are, characterized, by, norway, spruce, picea, abies, krummholz, and, alpine,

major, part, of, the, western, and, northeastern, outer, eastern, carpathians, in, poland, ukraine, and, slovakia, is, traditionally, called, the, eastern, beskids, romania, comprises, roughly, 50, of, the, carpathian, chain, where, the, rest, of, the, highest, peaks, above, 2500m, in, the, southern, carpathians, are, found, the, geological, border, between, the, western, and, eastern, carpathians, runs, approximately, along, the, line, south, to, north, between, the, towns, of, michalovce, bardejov, nowy, s, cz, and, tarn, w, in, older, systems, the, border, runs, more, in, the, east, along, the, line, north, to, south, along, the, rivers, san, and, os, awa, poland, the, town, of, snina, slovakia, and, river, tur, ia, ukraine, biologists, shift, the, border, even, further, to, the, east, the, border, between, the, eastern, and, southern, carpathians, is, formed, by, the, predeal, pass, south, of, bra, ov, and, the, prahova, valley, in, geopolitical, terms, carpathian, mountains, are, often, grouped, and, labeled, according, to, national, or, regional, borders, but, such, division, has, turned, out, to, be, relative, since, it, was, and, still, is, dependent, on, frequent, historical, political, and, administrative, changes, of, national, or, regional, borders, according, to, modern, geopolitical, division, carpathians, can, be, grouped, as, serbian, romanian, ukrainian, polish, slovakian, czech, and, austrian, within, each, nation, specific, classifications, of, the, carpathians, have, been, developing, often, reflecting, local, traditions, and, thus, creating, terminological, diversity, that, produces, various, challenges, in, the, fields, of, comparative, classification, and, international, systematization, the, section, of, the, carpathians, within, the, borders, of, romania, is, commonly, known, as, the, romanian, carpathians, in, local, use, romanians, sometimes, denote, as, eastern, carpathians, only, the, romanian, part, of, the, eastern, carpathians, which, lies, on, their, territory, i, e, from, the, ukrainian, border, or, from, the, prislop, pass, to, the, south, which, they, subdivide, into, three, simplified, geographical, groups, northern, central, southern, instead, of, outer, and, inner, eastern, carpathians, these, groups, are, the, section, of, the, carpathians, within, the, borders, of, ukraine, is, commonly, known, as, the, ukrainian, carpathians, classification, of, eastern, sections, of, the, carpathians, is, particularly, complex, since, it, was, influenced, by, several, overlapping, traditions, terms, like, wooded, carpathians, poloniny, mountains, or, eastern, beskids, are, often, used, in, varying, scopes, by, authors, belonging, to, different, traditions
