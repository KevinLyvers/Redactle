hawaii, h, w, a, i, h, wy, ee, hawaiian, hawai, i, is, an, island, state, of, the, united, states, in, the, pacific, ocean, about, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, southwest, of, the, u, s, mainland, it, is, the, only, state, not, on, the, north, american, mainland, the, only, state, that, is, an, archipelago, and, the, only, state, in, the, tropics, it, also, hosts, 10, out, of, 14, climates, the, highest, for, any, country, subdivision, and, is, one, of, two, u, s, states, with, a, tropical, climate, hawaii, consists, of, 137, volcanic, islands, that, comprise, almost, the, entire, hawaiian, archipelago, the, exception, which, is, outside, the, state, is, midway, atoll, spanning, 1, 500, miles, 2, 400, km, the, state, is, physiographically, and, ethnologically, part, of, the, polynesian, subregion, of, oceania, hawaii, s, ocean, coastline, is, consequently, the, fourth, longest, in, the, u, s, at, about, 750, miles, 1, 210, km, the, eight, main, islands, from, northwest, to, southeast, are, ni, ihau, kaua, i, o, ahu, moloka, i, l, na, i, kaho, olawe, maui, and, hawai, i, after, which, the, state, is, named, the, latter, is, often, called, the, big, island, or, hawaii, island, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, state, or, archipelago, the, uninhabited, northwestern, hawaiian, islands, make, up, most, of, the, papah, naumoku, kea, marine, national, monument, the, largest, protected, area, in, the, u, s, and, the, fourth, largest, in, the, world, of, the, 50, u, s, states, hawaii, is, the, eighth, smallest, in, land, area, and, the, 11th, least, populous, but, with, 1, 4, million, residents, it, ranks, 13th, in, population, density, two, thirds, of, hawaii, residents, live, on, o, ahu, home, to, the, state, s, capital, and, largest, city, honolulu, hawaii, is, among, the, country, s, most, diverse, states, owing, to, its, central, location, in, the, pacific, and, over, two, centuries, of, migration, as, one, of, only, six, majority, minority, states, it, has, the, only, asian, american, plurality, the, largest, buddhist, community, and, largest, proportion, of, multiracial, people, in, the, u, s, consequently, hawaii, is, a, unique, melting, pot, of, north, american, and, east, asian, cultures, in, addition, to, its, indigenous, hawaiian, heritage, settled, by, polynesians, sometime, between, 1000, and, 1200, ce, hawaii, was, home, to, numerous, independent, chiefdoms, in, 1778, british, explorer, james, cook, was, the, first, known, non, polynesian, to, arrive, at, the, archipelago, early, british, influence, is, reflected, in, the, state, flag, which, bears, a, union, jack, an, influx, of, european, and, american, explorers, traders, and, whalers, soon, arrived, leading, to, the, decimation, of, the, once, isolated, indigenous, community, through, the, introduction, of, diseases, such, as, syphilis, tuberculosis, smallpox, and, measles, the, native, hawaiian, population, declined, from, between, 300, 000, and, one, million, to, less, than, 40, 000, by, 1890, hawaii, became, a, unified, internationally, recognized, kingdom, in, 1810, remaining, independent, until, american, and, european, businessmen, overthrew, the, monarchy, in, 1893, this, led, to, annexation, by, the, u, s, in, 1898, as, a, strategically, valuable, u, s, territory, hawaii, was, attacked, by, japan, on, december, 7, 1941, which, brought, it, global, and, historical, significance, and, contributed, to, america, s, entry, into, world, war, ii, hawaii, is, the, most, recent, state, to, join, the, union, on, august, 21, 1959, in, 1993, the, u, s, government, formally, apologized, for, its, role, in, the, overthrow, of, hawaii, s, government, which, had, spurred, the, hawaiian, sovereignty, movement, and, has, led, to, ongoing, efforts, to, obtain, redress, for, the, indigenous, population, historically, dominated, by, a, plantation, economy, hawaii, remains, a, major, agricultural, exporter, due, to, its, fertile, soil, and, uniquely, tropical, climate, in, the, u, s, its, economy, has, gradually, diversified, since, the, mid, 20th, century, with, tourism, and, military, defense, becoming, the, two, largest, sectors, the, state, attracts, visitors, surfers, and, scientists, with, its, diverse, natural, scenery, warm, tropical, climate, abundant, public, beaches, oceanic, surroundings, active, volcanoes, and, clear, skies, on, the, big, island, hawaii, hosts, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, the, world, s, largest, naval, command, as, well, as, 75, 000, employees, of, the, defense, department, hawaii, s, isolation, results, in, one, of, the, highest, costs, of, living, in, the, u, s, however, hawaii, is, the, third, wealthiest, state, and, residents, have, the, longest, life, expectancy, of, any, u, s, state, at, 80, 7, years, the, state, of, hawaii, derives, its, name, from, the, name, of, its, largest, island, hawai, i, a, common, explanation, of, the, name, of, hawai, i, is, that, it, was, named, for, hawai, iloa, a, figure, from, hawaiian, oral, tradition, he, is, said, to, have, discovered, the, islands, when, they, were, first, settled, the, hawaiian, language, word, hawai, i, is, very, similar, to, proto, polynesian, sawaiki, with, the, reconstructed, meaning, homeland, cognates, of, hawai, i, are, found, in, other, polynesian, languages, including, m, ori, hawaiki, rarotongan, avaiki, and, samoan, savai, i, according, to, linguists, pukui, and, elbert, elsewhere, in, polynesia, hawai, i, or, a, cognate, is, the, name, of, the, underworld, or, of, the, ancestral, home, but, in, hawaii, the, name, has, no, meaning, in, 1978, hawaiian, was, added, to, the, constitution, of, the, state, of, hawaii, as, an, official, state, language, alongside, english, the, title, of, the, state, constitution, is, the, constitution, of, the, state, of, hawaii, article, xv, section, 1, of, the, constitution, uses, the, state, of, hawaii, diacritics, were, not, used, because, the, document, drafted, in, 1949, predates, the, use, of, the, okina, and, the, kahak, in, modern, hawaiian, orthography, the, exact, spelling, of, the, state, s, name, in, the, hawaiian, language, is, hawai, i, in, the, hawaii, admission, act, that, granted, hawaiian, statehood, the, federal, government, used, hawaii, as, the, state, name, official, government, publications, department, and, office, titles, and, the, seal, of, hawaii, use, the, spelling, without, symbols, for, glottal, stops, or, vowel, length, there, are, eight, main, hawaiian, islands, seven, are, inhabited, but, only, six, are, open, to, tourists, and, locals, ni, ihau, is, privately, managed, by, brothers, bruce, and, keith, robinson, access, is, restricted, to, those, who, have, their, permission, this, island, is, also, home, to, native, hawaiians, access, to, uninhabited, kaho, olawe, island, is, also, restricted, and, anyone, who, enters, without, permission, will, be, arrested, this, island, may, also, be, dangerous, since, it, was, a, military, base, during, the, world, wars, and, could, still, have, unexploded, ordnance, the, hawaiian, archipelago, is, 2, 000, mi, 3, 200, km, southwest, of, the, contiguous, united, states, hawaii, is, the, southernmost, u, s, state, and, the, second, westernmost, after, alaska, like, alaska, hawaii, borders, no, other, u, s, state, it, is, the, only, u, s, state, not, in, north, america, and, the, only, one, completely, surrounded, by, water, and, entirely, an, archipelago, in, addition, to, the, eight, main, islands, the, state, has, many, smaller, islands, and, islets, ka, ula, is, a, small, island, near, ni, ihau, the, northwestern, hawaiian, islands, is, a, group, of, nine, small, older, islands, northwest, of, kaua, i, that, extends, from, nihoa, to, kure, atoll, these, are, remnants, of, once, much, larger, volcanic, mountains, across, the, archipelago, are, around, 130, small, rocks, and, islets, such, as, molokini, which, are, made, up, of, either, volcanic, or, marine, sedimentary, rock, hawai, i, s, tallest, mountain, mauna, kea, is, 13, 796, ft, 4, 205, m, above, mean, sea, level, it, is, taller, than, mount, everest, if, measured, from, the, base, of, the, mountain, which, lies, on, the, floor, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, rises, about, 33, 500, feet, 10, 200, m, the, hawaiian, islands, were, formed, by, volcanic, activity, initiated, at, an, undersea, magma, source, called, the, hawai, i, hotspot, the, process, is, continuing, to, build, islands, the, tectonic, plate, beneath, much, of, the, pacific, ocean, continually, moves, northwest, and, the, hotspot, remains, stationary, slowly, creating, new, volcanoes, because, of, the, hotspot, s, location, all, active, land, volcanoes, are, on, the, southern, half, of, hawai, i, island, the, newest, volcano, kama, ehuakanaloa, formerly, l, ihi, is, south, of, the, coast, of, hawai, i, island, the, last, volcanic, eruption, outside, hawai, i, island, occurred, at, haleakal, on, maui, before, the, late, 18th, century, possibly, hundreds, of, years, earlier, in, 1790, k, lauea, exploded, it, is, the, deadliest, eruption, known, to,

the, eruption, destroyed, at, least, 36, buildings, and, this, coupled, with, the, lava, flows, and, the, sulfur, dioxide, fumes, necessitated, the, evacuation, of, more, than, 2, 000, inhabitants, from, their, neighborhoods, the, islands, of, hawai, i, are, distant, from, other, land, habitats, and, life, is, thought, to, have, arrived, there, by, wind, waves, i, e, by, ocean, currents, and, wings, i, e, birds, insects, and, any, seeds, that, they, may, have, carried, on, their, feathers, hawai, i, has, more, endangered, species, and, has, lost, a, higher, percentage, of, its, endemic, species, than, any, other, u, s, state, the, endemic, plant, brighamia, now, requires, hand, pollination, because, its, natural, pollinator, is, presumed, to, be, extinct, the, two, species, of,

hosting, more, military, space, for, the, united, states, than, any, other, territory, or, state, this, record, of, military, activity, has, taken, a, sharp, toll, on, the, environmental, health, of, the, hawaiian, archipelago, degrading, its, beaches, and, soil, and, making, some, places, entirely, unsafe, due, to, unexploded, ordnance, according, to, scholar, winona, laduke, the, vast, militarization, of, hawaii, has, profoundly, damaged, the, land, according, to, the, environmental, protection, agency, there, are, more, federal, hazardous, waste, sites, in, hawaii, 31, than, in, any, other, u, s, state, hawaii, state, representative, roy, takumi, writes, in, challenging, u, s, militarism, in, hawai, i, and, okinawa, that, these, military, bases, and, hazardous, waste, sites, have, meant, the, confiscation, of, large, tracts, of, land, from, native, peoples, and, quotes, late, hawaiian, activist, george, helm, as, asking, what, is, national, defense, when, what, is, being, destroyed, is, the, very, thing, the, military, is, entrusted, to, defend, the, sacred, land, of, hawai, i, contemporary, indigenous, hawaiians, are, still, protesting, the, occupation, of, their, homelands, and, environmental, degradation, due, to, increased, militarization, in, the, wake, of, 9, 11, after, the, rise, of, sugarcane, plantations, in, the, mid, 19th, century, island, ecology, changed, dramatically, plantations, require, massive, quantities, of, water, and, european, and, american, plantation, owners, transformed, the, land, in, order, to, access, it, primarily, by, building, tunnels, to, divert, water, from, the, mountains, to, the, plantations, constructing, reservoirs, and, digging, wells, these, changes, have, made, lasting, impacts, on, the, land, and, continue, to, contribute, to, resource, scarcity, for, native, hawaiians, today, according, to, stanford, scientist, and, scholar, sibyl, diver, indigenous, hawaiians, engage, in, a, reciprocal, relationship, with, the, land, based, on, principles, of, mutual, caretaking, reciprocity, and, sharing, this, relationship, ensures, the, longevity, sustainability, and, natural, cycles, of, growth, and, decay, as, well, as, cultivating, a, sense, of, respect, for, the, land, and, humility, towards, one, s, place, in, an, ecosystem, the, tourism, industry, s, ongoing, expansion, and, its, pressure, on, local, systems, of, ecology, cultural, tradition, and, infrastructure, is, creating, a, conflict, between, economic, and, environmental, health, in, 2020, the, center, for, biological, diversity, reported, on, the, plastic, pollution, of, hawaii, s, kamilo, beach, citing, massive, piles, of, plastic, waste, invasive, species, are, spreading, and, chemical, and, pathogenic, runoff, is, contaminating, groundwater, and, coastal, waters, hawai, i, is, one, of, two, u, s, states, along, with, texas, that, were, internationally, recognized, sovereign, nations, before, becoming, u, s, states, the, kingdom, of, hawai, i, was, sovereign, from, 1810, until, 1893, when, resident, american, and, european, capitalists, and, landholders, overthrew, the, monarchy, hawai, i, was, an, independent, republic, from, 1894, until, august, 12, 1898, when, it, officially, became, a, u, s, territory, hawai, i, was, admitted, as, a, u, s, state, on, august, 21, 1959, based, on, archaeological, evidence, the, earliest, habitation, of, the, hawaiian, islands, appears, to, date, between, 1000, and, 1200, ce, the, first, wave, was, probably, by, polynesian, settlers, from, the, marquesas, islands, and, a, second, wave, of, migration, from, raiatea, and, bora, bora, took, place, in, the, 11th, century, the, date, of, the, human, discovery, and, habitation, of, the, hawaiian, islands, is, the, subject, of, academic, debate, some, archaeologists, and, historians, think, it, was, a, later, wave, of, immigrants, from, tahiti, around, 1000, ce, who, introduced, a, new, line, of, high, chiefs, the, kapu, system, the, practice, of, human, sacrifice, and, the, building, of, heiau, this, later, immigration, is, detailed, in, hawaiian, mythology, mo, olelo, about, pa, ao, other, authors, say, there, is, no, archaeological, or, linguistic, evidence, of, a, later, influx, of, tahitian, settlers, and, that, pa, ao, must, be, regarded, as, a, myth, the, islands, history, is, marked, by, a, slow, steady, growth, in, population, and, the, size, of, the, chiefdoms, which, grew, to, encompass, whole, islands, local, chiefs, called, ali, i, ruled, their, settlements, and, launched, wars, to, extend, their, influence, and, defend, their, communities, from, predatory, rivals, ancient, hawai, i, was, a, caste, based, society, much, like, that, of, hindus, in, india, population, growth, was, facilitated, by, ecological, and, agricultural, practices, that, combined, upland, agriculture, manuka, ocean, fishing, makai, fishponds, and, gardening, systems, these, systems, were, upheld, by, spiritual, and, religious, beliefs, like, the, lokahi, that, linked, cultural, continuity, with, the, health, of, the, natural, world, according, to, hawaiian, scholar, mililani, trask, the, lokahi, symbolizes, the, greatest, of, the, traditions, values, and, practices, of, our, people, there, are, three, points, in, the, triangle, the, creator, akua, the, peoples, of, the, earth, kanaka, maoli, and, the, land, the, aina, these, three, things, all, have, a, reciprocal, relationship, the, 1778, arrival, of, british, explorer, captain, james, cook, marked, the, first, documented, contact, by, a, european, explorer, with, hawai, i, early, british, influence, can, be, seen, in, the, design, of, the, flag, of, hawai, i, which, bears, the, union, jack, in, the, top, left, corner, cook, named, the, archipelago, the, sandwich, islands, in, honor, of, his, sponsor, john, montagu, 4th, earl, of, sandwich, publishing, the, islands, location, and, rendering, the, native, name, as, owyhee, the, form, owyhee, or, owhyhee, is, preserved, in, the, names, of, certain, locations, in, the, american, part, of, the, pacific, northwest, among, them, owyhee, county, and, owyhee, mountains, in, idaho, named, after, three, native, hawaiian, members, of, a, trapping, party, who, went, missing, in, the, area, spanish, explorers, may, have, arrived, in, the, hawaiian, islands, in, the, 16th, century, 200, years, before, cook, s, first, documented, visit, in, 1778, ruy, l, pez, de, villalobos, commanded, a, fleet, of, six, ships, that, left, acapulco, in, 1542, bound, for, the, philippines, with, a, spanish, sailor, named, juan, gaetano, aboard, as, pilot, gaetano, s, reports, describe, an, encounter, with, either, hawai, i, or, the, marshall, islands, if, l, pez, de, villalobos, s, crew, spotted, hawai, i, gaetano, would, thus, be, the, first, european, to, see, the, islands, most, scholars, have, dismissed, these, claims, due, to, a, lack, of, credibility, nonetheless, spanish, archives, contain, a, chart, that, depicts, islands, at, the, same, latitude, as, hawai, i, but, with, a, longitude, ten, degrees, east, of, the, islands, in, this, manuscript, maui, is, named, la, desgraciada, the, unfortunate, island, and, what, appears, to, be, hawai, i, island, is, named, la, mesa, the, table, islands, resembling, kaho, olawe, l, na, i, and, moloka, i, are, named, los, monjes, the, monks, for, two, and, a, half, centuries, spanish, galleons, crossed, the, pacific, from, mexico, along, a, route, that, passed, south, of, hawai, i, on, their, way, to, manila, the, exact, route, was, kept, secret, to, protect, the, spanish, trade, monopoly, against, competing, powers, hawai, i, thus, maintained, independence, despite, being, on, a, sea, route, east, west, between, nations, that, were, subjects, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, an, empire, that, exercised, jurisdiction, over, many, subject, civilizations, and, kingdoms, on, both, sides, of, the, pacific, despite, such, contested, claims, cook, is, generally, considered, the, first, european, to, land, at, hawai, i, having, visited, the, hawaiian, islands, twice, as, he, prepared, for, departure, after, his, second, visit, in, 1779, a, quarrel, ensued, as, he, took, temple, idols, and, fencing, as, firewood, and, a, minor, chief, and, his, group, stole, a, boat, from, his, ship, cook, abducted, the, king, of, hawai, i, island, kalani, pu, u, and, held, him, for, ransom, aboard, his, ship, to, gain, return, of, cook, s, boat, as, this, tactic, had, previously, worked, in, tahiti, and, other, islands, instead, the, supporters, of, kalani, pu, u, attacked, killing, cook, and, four, sailors, as, cook, s, party, retreated, along, the, beach, to, their, ship, the, ship, departed, without, retrieving, the, stolen, boat, after, cook, s, visit, and, the, publication, of, several, books, relating, his, voyages, the, hawaiian, islands, attracted, many, european, and, american, explorers, traders, and, whalers, who, found, the, islands, to, be, a, convenient, harbor, and, source, of, supplies, these, visitors, introduced, diseases, to, the, once,

ranks, hawaii, third, in, income, tax, burden, and, second, in, its, overall, tax, burden, though, notes, that, a, significant, portion, of, taxes, are, borne, by, tourists, former, state, senator, sam, slom, attributed, hawaii, s, comparatively, high, tax, rate, to, the, fact, that, the, state, government, is, responsible, for, education, health, care, and, social, services, that, are, usually, handled, at, a, county, or, municipal, level, in, most, other, states, the, cost, of, living, in, hawaii, specifically, honolulu, is, high, compared, to, that, of, most, major, u, s, cities, although, it, is, 6, 7, lower, than, in, new, york, city, and, 3, 6, lower, than, in, san, francisco, these, numbers, may, not, take, into, account, some, costs, such, as, increased, travel, costs, for, flights, additional, shipping, fees, and, the, loss, of, promotional, participation, opportunities, for, customers, outside, the, contiguous, u, s, while, some, online, stores, offer, free, shipping, on, orders, to, hawaii, many, merchants, exclude, hawaii, alaska, puerto, rico, and, certain, other, u, s, territories, hawaiian, electric, industries, a, privately, owned, company, provides, 95, of, the, state, s, population, with, electricity, mostly, from, fossil, fuel, power, stations, average, electricity, prices, in, october, 2014, 36, 41, cents, per, kilowatt, hour, were, nearly, three,

was, us, 272, 700, while, the, national, median, home, value, was, us, 119, 600, hawaii, home, values, were, the, highest, of, all, states, including, california, with, a, median, home, value, of, us,

sales, price, at, us, 173, 200, the, sale, price, of, single, family, homes, in, hawaii, was, the, highest, of, any, u, s, city, in, 2010, just, above, that, of, the, silicon, valley, area, of, california, us, 602, 000, hawaii, s, very, high, cost, of, living, is, the, result, of, several, interwoven, factors, of, the, global, economy, in, addition, to, domestic, u, s, government, trade, policy, like, other, regions, with, desirable, weather, year, round, such, as, california, arizona, and, florida, hawaii, s, residents, can, be, considered, to, be, subject, to, a, sunshine, tax, this, situation, is, further, exacerbated, by, the, natural, factors, of, geography, and, world, distribution, that, lead, to, higher, prices, for, goods, due, to, increased, shipping, costs, a, problem, which, many, island, states, and, territories, suffer, from, as, well, the, higher, costs, to, ship, goods, across, an, ocean, may, be, further, increased, by, the, requirements, of, the, jones, act, which, generally, requires, that, goods, be, transported, between, places, within, the, u, s, including, between, the, mainland, u, s, west, coast, and, hawaii, using, only, u, s, owned, built, and, crewed, ships, jones, act, compliant, vessels, are, often, more, expensive, to, build, and, operate, than, foreign, equivalents, which, can, drive, up, shipping, costs, while, the, jones, act, does, not, affect, transportation, of, goods, to, hawaii, directly, from, asia, this, type, of, trade, is, nonetheless, not, common, this, is, a, result, of, other, primarily, economic, reasons, including, additional, costs, associated, with, stopping, over, in, hawaii, e, g, pilot, and, port, fees, the, market, size, of, hawaii, and, the, economics, of, using, ever, larger, ships, that, cannot, be, handled, in, hawaii, for, transoceanic, voyages, therefore, hawaii, relies, on, receiving, most, inbound, goods, on, jones, act, qualified, vessels, originating, from, the, u, s, west, coast, which, may, contribute, to, the, increased, cost, of, some, consumer, goods, and, therefore, the, overall, cost, of, living, critics, of, the, jones, act, contend, that, hawaii, consumers, ultimately, bear, the, expense, of, transporting, goods, imposed, by, the, jones, act, the, aboriginal, culture, of, hawaii, is, polynesian, hawaii, represents, the, northernmost, extension, of, the, vast, polynesian, triangle, of, the, south, and, central, pacific, ocean, while, traditional, hawaiian, culture, remains, as, vestiges, in, modern, hawaiian, society, there, are, re, enactments, of, the, ceremonies, and, traditions, throughout, the, islands, some, of, these, cultural, influences, including, the, popularity, in, greatly, modified, form, of, l, au, and, hula, are, strong, enough, to, affect, the, wider, united, states, the, cuisine, of, hawaii, is, a, fusion, of, many, foods, brought, by, immigrants, to, the, hawaiian, islands, including, the, earliest, polynesians, and, native, hawaiian, cuisine, and, american, chinese, filipino, japanese, korean, polynesian, puerto, rican, and, portuguese, origins, plant, and, animal, food, sources, are, imported, from, around, the, world, for, agricultural, use, in, hawaii, poi, a, starch, made, by, pounding, taro, is, one, of, the, traditional, foods, of, the, islands, many, local, restaurants, serve, the, ubiquitous, plate, lunch, which, features, two, scoops, of, rice, a, simplified, version, of, american, macaroni, salad, and, a, variety, of, toppings, including, hamburger, patties, a, fried, egg, and, gravy, of, a, loco, moco, japanese, style, tonkatsu, or, the, traditional, l, au, favorites, including, k, lua, pork, and, laulau, spam, musubi, is, an, example, of, the, fusion, of, ethnic, cuisine, that, developed, on, the, islands, among, the, mix, of, immigrant, groups, and, military, personnel, in, the, 1990s, a, group, of, chefs, developed, hawaii, regional, cuisine, as, a, contemporary, fusion,
