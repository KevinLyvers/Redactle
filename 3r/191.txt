which, ended, around, 10, 000, bc, is, called, the, vistulian, glaciation, or, weichselian, glaciation, in, regard, to, north, central, europe, the, river, forms, a, wide, delta, called, u, awy, wi, lane, or, the, vistula, fens, in, english, the, delta, currently, starts, around, bia, a, g, ra, near, sztum, about, 50, km, 31, mi, from, the, mouth, where, the, river, nogat, splits, off, the, nogat, also, starts, separately, as, a, river, named, on, this, map, alte, nogat, old, nogat, south, of, kwidzyn, but, further, north, it, picks, up, water, from, a, crosslink, with, the, vistula, and, becomes, a, distributary, of, the, vistula, flowing, away, northeast, into, the, vistula, lagoon, polish, zalew, wi, lany, with, a, small, delta, the, nogat, formed, part, of, the, border, between, east, prussia, and, interwar, poland, the, other, channel, of, the, vistula, below, this, point, is, sometimes, called, the, leniwka, various, causes, rain, snow, melt, ice, jams, have, caused, many, severe, floods, of, the, vistula, over, the, centuries, land, in, the, area, was, sometimes, depopulated, by, severe, flooding, and, later, had, to, be, resettled, see, figure, 7, on,

przegalinie, branch, reached, the, sea, in, danzig, until, the, 14th, century, the, elbing, vistula, was, the, bigger, list, of, right, and, left, tributaries, with, a, nearby, city, from, source, to, mouth, according, to, flood, studies, carried, out, by, zbigniew, pruszak, who, is, the, co, author, of, the, scientific, paper, implications, of, slr, and, further, studies, carried, out, by, scientists, attending, poland, s, final, international, astra, conference, and, predictions, stated, by, climate, scientists, at, the, climate, change, pre, summit, in, copenhagen, it, is, highly, likely, most, of, the, vistula, delta, region, which, is, below, sea, level, will, be, flooded, due, to, the, sea, level, rise, caused, by, climate, change, by, 2100, the, history, of, the, river, vistula, and, its, valley, spans, over, 2, million, years, the, river, is, connected, to, the, geological, period, called, the, quaternary, in, which, distinct, cooling, of, the, climate, took, place, in, the, last, million, years, an, ice, sheet, entered, the, area, of, poland, eight, times, bringing, along, with, it, changes, of, reaches, of, the, river, in, warmer, periods, when, the, ice, sheet, retreated, the, vistula, deepened, and, widened, its, valley, the, river, took, its, present, shape, within, the, last, 14, 000, years, after, the, complete, recession, of, the, scandinavian, ice, sheet, from, the, area, at, present, along, with, the, vistula, valley, erosion, of, the, banks, and, collecting, of, new, deposits, are, still, occurring, as, the, principal, river, of, poland, the, vistula, is, also, in, the, centre, of, europe, three, principal, geographical, and, geological, land, masses, of, the, continent, meet, in, its, river, basin, the, eastern, european, plain, western, europe, and, the, alpine, zone, to, which, the, alps, and, the, carpathians, belong, the, vistula, begins, in, the, carpathian, mountains, the, run, and, character, of, the, river, were, shaped, by, ice, sheets, flowing, down, from, the, scandinavian, peninsula, the, last, ice, sheet, entered, the, area, of, poland, about, 20, 000, years, ago, during, periods, of, warmer, weather, the, ancient, vistula, pra, wis, a, searched, for, the, shortest, way, to, the, sea, thousands, of, years, ago, it, flowed, into, the, north, sea, somewhere, at, the, latitude, of, contemporary, scotland, the, climate, of, the, vistula, valley, its, plants, animals, and, its, very, character, changed, considerably, during, the, process, of, glacial, retreat, the, vistula, is, navigable, from, the, baltic, sea, to, bydgoszcz, where, the, bydgoszcz, canal, joins, the, river, the, vistula, can, accommodate, modest, river, vessels, of, cemt, class, ii, farther, upstream, the, river, depth, lessens, although, a, project, was, undertaken, to, increase, the, traffic, carrying, capacity, of, the, river, upstream, of, warsaw, by, building, a, number, of, locks, in, and, around, krak, w, this, project, was, not, extended, further, so, that, navigability, of, the, vistula, remains, limited, the, potential, of, the, river, would, increase, considerably, if, a, restoration, of, the, east, west, connection, via, the, narew, bug, mukhovets, pripyat, dnieper, waterways, were, considered, the, shifting, economic, importance, of, parts, of, europe, may, make, this, option, more, likely, the, vistula, is, the, northern, part, of, the, proposed, e40, waterway, continuing, eastward, into, the, bug, river, linking, the, baltic, sea, to, the, black, sea, large, parts, of, the, vistula, basin, were, occupied, by, the, iron, age, lusatian, and, przeworsk, cultures, in, the, first, millennium, bc, genetic, analysis, indicates, that, there, has, been, an, unbroken, genetic, continuity, of, the, inhabitants, over, the, last, 3, 500, years, the, vistula, basin, along, with, the, lands, of, the, rhine, danube, elbe, and, oder, came, to, be, called, magna, germania, by, roman, authors, of, the, first, century, ad, this, does, not, imply, that, the, inhabitants, were, germanic, peoples, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, tacitus, when, describing, the, venethi, peucini, and, fenni, wrote, that, he, was, not, sure, if, he, should, call, them, germans, since, they, had, settlements, and, they, fought, on, foot, or, rather, sarmatians, since, they, have, some, similar, customs, to, them, ptolemy, in, the, second, century, ad, would, describe, the, vistula, as, the, border, between, germania, and, sarmatia, the, vistula, river, used, to, be, connected, to, the, dnieper, river, and, thence, to, the, black, sea, via, the, august, w, canal, a, technological, marvel, with, numerous, sluices, contributing, to, its, aesthetic, appeal, it, was, the, first, waterway, in, central, europe, to, provide, a, direct, link, between, the, two, major, rivers, the, vistula, and, the, neman, it, provided, a, link, with, the, black, sea, to, the, south, through, the, oginski, canal, dnieper, river, berezina, canal, and, dvina, river, the, baltic, sea, vistula, dnieper, black, sea, route, with, its, rivers, was, one, of, the, most, ancient, trade, routes, the, amber, road, on, which, amber, and, other, items, were, traded, from, northern, europe, to, greece, asia, egypt, and, elsewhere, the, vistula, estuary, was, settled, by, slavs, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, century, based, on, archeological, and, linguistic, findings, it, has, been, postulated, that, these, settlers, moved, northward, along, the, vistula, river, this, however, contradicts, another, hypothesis, supported, by, some, researchers, saying, the, veleti, moved, westward, from, the, vistula, delta, a, number, of, west, slavic, polish, tribes, formed, small, dominions, beginning, in, the, eighth, century, some, of, which, coalesced, later, into, larger, ones, among, the, tribes, listed, in, the, bavarian, geographer, s, ninth, century, document, was, the, vistulans, wi, lanie, in, southern, poland, krak, w, and, wi, lica, were, their, main, centres, many, polish, legends, are, connected, with, the, vistula, and, the, beginnings, of, polish, statehood, one, of, the, most, enduring, is, that, about, princess, wanda, co, nie, chcia, a, niemca, who, rejected, the, german, according, to, the, most, popular, variant, popularized, by, the, 15th, century, historian, jan, d, ugosz, wanda, daughter, of, king, krak, became, queen, of, the, poles, upon, her, father, s, death, she, refused, to, marry, a, german, prince, rytigier, r, diger, who, took, offence, and, invaded, poland, but, was, repelled, wanda, however, committed, suicide, drowning, in, the, vistula, river, to, ensure, he, would, not, invade, her, country, again, for, hundreds, of, years, the, river, was, one, of, the, main, trading, arteries, of, poland, and, the, castles, that, line, its, banks, were, highly, prized, possessions, salt, timber, grain, and, building, stone, were, among, goods, shipped, via, that, route, between, the, 10th, and, 13th, centuries, in, the, 14th, century, the, lower, vistula, was, controlled, by, the, teutonic, knights, order, invited, in, 1226, by, konrad, i, of, masovia, to, help, him, fight, the, pagan, prussians, on, the, border, of, his, lands, in, 1308, the, teutonic, knights, captured, the, gda, sk, castle, and, murdered, the, population, since, then, the, event, is, known, as, the, gda, sk, slaughter, the, order, had, inherited, gniew, from, sambor, ii, thus, gaining, a, foothold, on, the, left, bank, of, the, vistula, many, granaries, and, storehouses, built, in, the, 14th, century, line, the, banks, of, the, vistula, in, the, 15th, century, the, city, of, gda, sk, gained, great, importance, in, the, baltic, area, as, a, centre, of, merchants, and, trade, and, as, a, port, city, at, this, time, the, surrounding, lands, were, inhabited, by, pomeranians, but, gda, sk, soon, became, a, starting, point, for, german, settlement, of, the, largely, fallow, vistulan, country, before, its, peak, in, 1618, trade, increased, by, a, factor, of, 20, from, 1491, this, factor, is, evident, when, looking, at, the, tonnage, of, grain, traded, on, the, river, in, the, key, years, of, 1491, 14, 000, 1537, 23, 000, 1563, 150, 000, 1618, 310, 000, in, the, 16th, century, most, of, the, grain, exported, was, leaving, poland, through, gda, sk, which, because, of, its, location, at, the, end, of, the, vistula, and, its, tributary, waterway, and, of, its, baltic, seaport, trade, role, became, the, wealthiest, most, highly, developed, and, by, far, the, largest, centre, of, crafts, and, manufacturing, and, the, most, autonomous, of, the, polish, cities, other, towns, were, negatively, affected, by, gda, sk, s,

the, western, dvina, trade, both, cities, were, among, the, largest, in, the, country, around, 70, the, exports, from, gda, sk, were, of, grain, grain, was, also, the, largest, export, commodity, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, volume, of, traded, grain, can, be, considered, a, good, and, well, measured, proxy, for, the, economic, growth, of, the, commonwealth, the, owner, of, a, folwark, usually, signed, a, contract, with, the, merchants, of, gda, sk, who, controlled, 80, of, this, inland, trade, to, ship, the, grain, to, gda, sk, many, rivers, in, the, commonwealth, were, used, for, shipping, including, the, vistula, which, had, a, relatively, well, developed, infrastructure, with, river, ports, and, granaries, most, river, shipping, travelled, north, with, southward, transport, being, less, profitable, and, barges, and, rafts, often, being, sold, off, in, gda, sk, for, lumber, in, order, to, arrest, recurrent, flooding, on, the, lower, vistula, the, prussian, government, in, 1889, 95, constructed, an, artificial, channel, about, 12, kilometres, 7, miles, east, of, gda, sk, german, name, danzig, known, as, the, vistula, cut, german, weichseldurchstich, polish, przekop, wis, y, that, acted, as, a, huge, sluice, diverting, much, of, the, vistula, flow, directly, into, the, baltic, as, a, result, the, historic, vistula, channel, through, gda, sk, lost, much, of, its, flow, and, was, known, thereafter, as, the, dead, vistula, german, tote, weichsel, polish, martwa, wis, a, german, states, acquired, complete, control, of, the, region, in, 1795, 1812,
