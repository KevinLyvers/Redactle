k2, at, 8, 611, metres, 28, 251, ft, above, sea, level, is, the, second, highest, mountain, on, earth, after, mount, everest, at, 8, 849, metres, 29, 032, ft, it, lies, in, the, karakoram, range, partially, in, the, gilgit, baltistan, region, of, pakistan, administered, kashmir, and, partially, in, the, china, administered, trans, karakoram, tract, in, the, taxkorgan, tajik, autonomous, county, of, xinjiang, k2, became, known, as, the, savage, mountain, after, george, bell, a, climber, on, the, 1953, american, expedition, said, it, s, a, savage, mountain, that, tries, to, kill, you, of, the, five, highest, mountains, in, the, world, k2, has, long, been, the, deadliest, prior, to, 2021, approximately, one, person, had, died, on, the, mountain, for, every, four, who, reached, the, summit, after, an, increase, in, successful, attempts, as, of, august, 2023, an, estimated, 800, people, have, summited, k2, with, 96, deaths, during, attempted, climbs, also, occasionally, known, as, mount, godwin, austen, other, nicknames, for, k2, are, the, king, of, mountains, and, the, mountaineers, mountain, as, well, as, the, mountain, of, mountains, after, prominent, italian, climber, reinhold, messner, titled, his, book, about, k2, the, same, although, the, summit, of, everest, is, at, a, higher, altitude, k2, is, a, more, difficult, and, dangerous, climb, due, in, part, to, its, more, northern, location, where, inclement, weather, is, more, common, the, summit, was, reached, for, the, first, time, by, the, italian, climbers, lino, lacedelli, and, achille, compagnoni, on, the, 1954, italian, expedition, led, by, ardito, desio, most, ascents, are, made, during, july, and, august, typically, the, warmest, times, of, the, year, in, january, 2021, k2, became, the, final, eight, thousander, to, be, summited, in, the, winter, by, a, team, of, nepalese, climbers, led, by, nirmal, purja, and, mingma, gyalje, sherpa, k2, has, been, climbed, by, almost, all, of, its, ridges, apart, from, its, eastern, face, which, remains, unclimbed, the, name, k2, is, derived, from, the, notation, used, by, the, great, trigonometrical, survey, of, british, india, thomas, montgomerie, made, the, first, survey, of, the, karakoram, from, mount, haramukh, some, 210, km, 130, mi, to, the, south, and, sketched, the, two, most, prominent, peaks, labelling, them, k1, and, k2, where, the, k, stands, for, karakoram, the, policy, of, the, great, trigonometrical, survey, was, to, use, local, names, for, mountains, wherever, possible, and, k1, was, found, to, be, known, locally, as, masherbrum, k2, however, appeared, not, to, have, acquired, a, local, name, possibly, due, to, its, remoteness, the, mountain, is, not, visible, from, askole, one, of, the, highest, settlements, on, the, way, to, the, mountain, nor, from, the, nearest, habitation, to, the, north, k2, is, only, fleetingly, glimpsed, from, the, end, of, the, baltoro, glacier, beyond, which, few, local, people, would, have, ventured, the, name, chogori, derived, from, two, balti, words, chhogo, big, and, ri, mountain, has, been, suggested, as, a, local, name, but, evidence, for, its, widespread, use, is, scant, it, may, have, been, a, compound, name, invented, by, western, explorers, or, simply, a, bemused, reply, to, the, question, what, s, that, called, it, does, however, form, the, basis, for, the, name, qogir, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, qi, og, l, f, ng, by, which, chinese, authorities, officially, refer, to, the, peak, other, local, names, have, been, suggested, including, lamba, pahar, tall, mountain, in, urdu, and, dapsang, but, these, are, not, widely, used, with, the, mountain, lacking, a, local, name, the, name, mount, godwin, austen, was, suggested, in, honour, of, henry, godwin, austen, an, early, explorer, of, the, area, while, the, name, was, rejected, by, the, royal, geographical, society, it, was, used, on, several, maps, and, continues, to, be, used, occasionally, the, surveyor, s, mark, k2, therefore, continues, to, be, the, name, by, which, the, mountain, is, commonly, known, it, is, now, also, used, in, the, balti, language, rendered, as, kechu, or, ketu, balti, urdu, the, italian, climber, fosco, maraini, argued, in, his, account, of, the, ascent, of, gasherbrum, iv, that, while, the, name, of, k2, owes, its, origin, to, chance, its, clipped, impersonal, nature, is, highly, appropriate, for, so, remote, and, challenging, a, mountain, he, concluded, that, it, was, just, the, bare, bones, of, a, name, all, rock, and, ice, and, storm, and, abyss, it, makes, no, attempt, to, sound, human, it, is, atoms, and, stars, it, has, the, nakedness, of, the, world, before, the, first, man, or, of, the, cindered, planet, after, the, last, andr, weil, named, k3, surfaces, in, mathematics, partly, after, the, beauty, of, the, mountain, k2, k2, lies, in, the, northwestern, karakoram, range, it, is, located, in, the, baltistan, region, of, gilgit, baltistan, pakistan, and, the, taxkorgan, tajik, autonomous, county, of, xinjiang, china, the, tarim, sedimentary, basin, borders, the, range, on, the, north, and, the, lesser, himalayas, on, the, south, melt, waters, from, glaciers, such, as, those, south, and, east, of, k2, feed, agriculture, in, the, valleys, and, contribute, significantly, to, the, regional, fresh, water, supply, k2, is, ranked, 22nd, by, topographic, prominence, a, measure, of, a, mountain, s, independent, stature, it, is, a, part, of, the, same, extended, area, of, uplift, including, the, karakoram, the, tibetan, plateau, and, the, himalayas, as, mount, everest, and, it, is, possible, to, follow, a, path, from, k2, to, everest, that, goes, no, lower, than, 4, 594, metres, 15, 072, ft, at, the, kora, la, on, the, nepal, china, border, in, the, mustang, lo, many, other, peaks, far, lower, than, k2, are, more, independent, in, this, sense, it, is, however, the, most, prominent, peak, within, the, karakoram, range, k2, is, notable, for, its, local, relief, as, well, as, its, total, height, it, stands, over, 3, 000, metres, 9, 840, ft, above, much, of, the, glacial, valley, bottoms, at, its, base, it, is, a, consistently, steep, pyramid, dropping, quickly, in, almost, all, directions, the, north, side, is, the, steepest, there, it, rises, over, 3, 200, metres, 10, 500, ft, above, the, k2, qogir, glacier, in, only, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, of, horizontal, distance, in, most, directions, it, achieves, over, 2, 800, metres, 9, 200, ft, of, vertical, relief, in, less, than, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, ft, a, 1986, expedition, led, by, george, wallerstein, made, an, inaccurate, measurement, showing, that, k2, was, taller, than, mount, everest, and, therefore, the, tallest, mountain, in, the, world, a, corrected, measurement, was, made, in, 1987, but, by, then, the, claim, that, k2, was, the, tallest, mountain, in, the, world, had, already, made, it, into, many, news, reports, and, reference, works, k2, s, height, given, on, maps, and, encyclopedias, is, 8, 611, metres, 28, 251, ft, in, the, summer, of, 2014, a, pakistani, italian, expedition, to, k2, named, k2, 60, years, later, was, organized, to, commemorate, the, 60th, anniversary, of, the, first, ascent, of, k2, one, of, the, goals, of, the, expedition, was, to, accurately, measure, the, height, of, the, mountain, using, satellite, navigation, the, height, of, k2, measured, during, this, expedition, was, 8, 609, 02, metres, 28, 244, 8, ft, the, mountains, of, k2, and, broad, peak, and, the, area, westward, to, the, lower, reaches, of, sarpo, laggo, glacier, consist, of, metamorphic, rocks, known, as, the, k2, gneiss, and, part, of, the, karakoram, metamorphic, complex, the, k2, gneiss, consists, of, a, mixture, of, orthogneiss, and, biotite, rich, paragneiss, on, the, south, and, southeast, face, of, k2, the, orthogneiss, consists, of, a, mixture, of, a, strongly, foliated, plagioclase, hornblende, gneiss, and, a, biotite, hornblende, k, feldspar, orthogneiss, which, has, been, intruded, by, garnet, mica, leucogranitic, dikes, in, places, the, paragneisses, include, clinopyroxene, hornblende, bearing, psammites, garnet, grossular, diopside, marbles, and, biotite, graphite, phyllites, near, the, memorial, to, the, climbers, who, have, died, on, k2, above, base, camp, on, the, south, spur, thin, impure, marbles, with, quartzites, and, mica, schists, called, the, gilkey, puchoz, sequence, are, interbanded, within, the, orthogneisses, on, the, west, face, of, broad, peak, and, the, south, spur, of, k2, lamprophyre, dikes, which, consist, of, clinopyroxene, and, biotite, porphyritic, vogesites, and, minettes, have, intruded, the, k2, gneiss, the, k2, gneiss, is, separated, from, the, surrounding, sedimentary, and, metasedimentary, rocks, of, the, surrounding, karakoram, metamorphic, complex, by, normal, faults, for, example, a, fault, separates, the, k2, gneiss, of, the, east, face, of, k2, from, limestones, and, slates, comprising, nearby, skyang, kangri, 40, ar, 39, ar, ages, of, 115, to, 120, million, years, ago, obtained, from, and, geochemical, analyses, of, the, k2, gneiss, demonstrate, that, it, is, a, metamorphosed, older, cretaceous, pre, collisional, granite, the, granitic, precursor, protolith, to, the, k2, gneiss, originated, as, the, result, of, the, production, of, large, bodies, of, magma, by, a, northward, dipping, subduction, zone, along, what, was, the, continental, margin, of, asia, at, that, time, and, their, intrusion, as, batholiths, into, its, lower, continental, crust, during, the, initial, collision, of, the, asia, and, indian, plates, this, granitic, batholith, was, buried, to, depths, of, about, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, or, more, highly, metamorphosed, highly, deformed, and, partially, remelted, during, the, eocene, period, to, form, gneiss, later, the, k2, gneiss, was, then, intruded, by, leucogranite, dikes, and, finally, exhumed, and, uplifted, along, major, breakback, thrust, faults, during, post, miocene, time, the, k2, gneiss, was, exposed, as, the, entire, k2, broad, peak, gasherbrum, range, experienced, rapid, uplift, with, which, erosion, rates, have, been, unable, to, keep, pace, the, mountain, was, first, surveyed, by, a, british, team, in, 1856, team, member, thomas, montgomerie, designated, the, mountain, k2, for, being, the, second, peak, of, the, karakoram, range, the, other, peaks, were, originally, named, k1, k3, k4, and, k5, but, were, eventually, renamed, masherbrum, gasherbrum, iv, gasherbrum, ii, and, gasherbrum, i, respectively, in, 1892, martin, conway, led, a, british, expedition, that, reached, concordia, on, the, baltoro, glacier, the, first, serious, attempt, to, climb, k2, was, undertaken, in, 1902, by, oscar, eckenstein, aleister, crowley, jules, jacot, guillarmod, heinrich, pfannl, victor, wessely, and, guy, knowles, via, the, northeast, ridge, in, the, early, 1900s, modern, transportation, did, not, exist, in, the, region, it, took, fourteen, days, just, to, reach, the, foot, of, the, mountain, after, five, serious, and, costly, attempts, the, team, reached, 6, 525, metres, 21, 407, ft, although, considering, the, difficulty, of, the, challenge, and, the, lack, of, modern, climbing, equipment, or, weatherproof, fabrics, crowley, s, statement, that, neither, man, nor, beast, was, injured, highlights, the, relative, skill, of, the, ascent, the, failures, were, also, attributed, to, sickness, crowley, was, suffering, the, residual, effects, of, malaria, a, combination, of, questionable, physical, training, personality, conflicts, and, poor, weather, conditions, of, 68, days, spent, on, k2, at, the, time, the, record, for, the, longest, time, spent, at, such, an, altitude, only, eight, provided, clear, weather, the, next, expedition, to, k2, in, 1909, led, by, prince, luigi, amedeo, duke, of, the, abruzzi, reached, an, elevation, of, around, 6, 250, metres, 20, 510, ft, on, the, south, east, spur, now, known, as, the, abruzzi, spur, or, abruzzi, ridge, this, would, eventually, become, part, of, the, standard, route, but, was, abandoned, at, the, time, due, to, its, steepness, and, difficulty, after, trying, and, failing, to, find, a, feasible, alternative, route, on, the, west, ridge, or, the, north, east, ridge, the, duke, declared, that, k2, would, never, be, climbed, and, the, team, switched, its, attention, to, chogolisa, where, the, duke, came, within, 150, metres, 490, ft, of, the, summit, before, being, driven, back, by, a, storm, the, next, attempt, on, k2, was, not, made, until, 1938, when, the, first, american, karakoram, expedition, led, by, charles, houston, made, a, reconnaissance, of, the, mountain, they, concluded, that, the, abruzzi, spur, was, the, most, practical, route, and, reached, a, height, of, around, 8, 000, meters, 26, 000, ft, before, turning, back, due, to, diminishing, supplies, and, the, threat, of, bad, weather, the, following, year, the, 1939, american, expedition, led, by, fritz, wiessner, came, within, 200, metres, 660, ft, of, the, summit, but, ended, in, disaster, when, dudley, wolfe, pasang, kikuli, pasang, kitar, and, pintso, disappeared, high, on, the, mountain, charles, houston, returned, to, k2, to, lead, the, 1953, american, expedition, the, attempt, failed, after, a, storm, pinned, down, the, team, for, 10, days, at, 7, 800, metres, 25, 590, ft, during, which, time, climber, art, gilkey, became, critically, ill, a, desperate, retreat, followed, during, which, pete, schoening, saved, almost, the, entire, team, during, a, mass, fall, known, simply, as, the, belay, and, gilkey, was, killed, either, in, an, avalanche, or, in, a, deliberate, attempt, to, avoid, burdening, his, companions, despite, the, retreat, and, tragic, end, the, expedition, has, been, given, iconic, status, in, mountaineering, history, the, gilkey, memorial, was, built, in, his, memory, at, the, mountain, s, foot, the, 1954, italian, expedition, finally, succeeded, in, ascending, to, the, summit, of, k2, via, the, abruzzi, spur, on, 31, july, 1954, the, expedition, was, led, by, ardito, desio, and, the, two, climbers, who, reached, the, summit, were, lino, lacedelli, and, achille, compagnoni, the, team, included, a, pakistani, member, colonel, muhammad, ata, ullah, who, had, been, a, part, of, the, 1953, american, expedition, also, on, the, expedition, were, walter, bonatti, and, pakistani, hunza, porter, amir, mehdi, who, both, proved, vital, to, the, expedition, s, success, in, that, they, carried, oxygen, tanks, to, 8, 100, metres, 26, 600, ft, for, lacedelli, and, compagnoni, the, ascent, is, controversial, because, lacedelli, and, compagnoni, established, their, camp, at, a, higher, elevation, than, originally, agreed, with, mehdi, and, bonatti, it, being, too, dark, to, ascend, or, descend, mehdi, and, bonatti, were, forced, to, overnight, without, shelter, above, 8, 000, metres, 26, 000, ft, leaving, the, oxygen, tanks, behind, as, requested, when, they, descended, bonatti, and, mehdi, survived, but, mehdi, was, hospitalised, for, months, and, had, to, have, his, toes, amputated, because, of, frostbite, efforts, in, the, 1950s, to, suppress, these, facts, to, protect, lacedelli, and, compagnoni, s, reputations, as, italian, national, heroes, were, later, brought, to, light, it, was, also, revealed, that, the, moving, of, the, camp, was, deliberate, a, move, apparently, made, because, compagnoni, feared, being, outshone, by, the, younger, bonatti, bonatti, was, given, the, blame, for, mehdi, s, hospitalisation, on, 9, august, 1977, 23, years, after, the, italian, expedition, ichiro, yoshizawa, led, the, second, successful, ascent, with, ashraf, aman, as, the, first, native, pakistani, climber, the, japanese, expedition, took, the, abruzzi, spur, and, used, more, than, 1, 500, porters, the, third, ascent, of, k2, was, in, 1978, via, a, new, route, the, long, and, corniced, northeast, ridge, the, top, of, the, route, traversed, left, across, the, east, face, to, avoid, a, vertical, headwall, and, joined, the, uppermost, part, of, the, abruzzi, route, this, ascent, was, made, by, an, american, team, led, by, james, whittaker, the, summit, party, was, louis, reichardt, jim, wickwire, john, roskelley, and, rick, ridgeway, wickwire, endured, an, overnight, bivouac, about, 150, metres, 490, ft, below, the, summit, one, of, the, highest, bivouacs, in, history, this, ascent, was, emotional, for, the, american, team, as, they, saw, themselves, as, completing, a, task, that, had, been, begun, by, the, 1938, team, forty, years, earlier, another, notable, japanese, ascent, was, that, of, the, difficult, north, ridge, on, the, chinese, side, of, the, peak, in, 1982, a, team, from, the, japan, mountaineering, association, led, by, isao, shinkai, and, masatsugo, konishi, put, three, members, naoe, sakashita, hiroshi, yoshino, and, yukihiro, yanagisawa, on, the, summit, on, 14, august, however, yanagisawa, fell, and, died, on, the, descent, four, other, members, of, the, team, achieved, the, summit, the, next, day, the, first, climber, to, reach, the, summit, of, k2, twice, was, czech, climber, josef, rakoncaj, rakoncaj, was, a, member, of, the, 1983, italian, expedition, led, by, francesco, santon, which, made, the, second, successful, ascent, of, the, north, ridge, 31, july, 1983, three, years, later, on, 5, july, 1986, he, reached, the, summit, via, the, abruzzi, spur, double, with, broad, peak, west, face, solo, as, a, member, of, agostino, da, polenza, s, international, expedition, the, first, woman, to, summit, k2, was, polish, climber, wanda, rutkiewicz, on, 23, june, 1986, liliane, and, maurice, barrard, who, had, summited, later, that, day, fell, during, the, descent, liliane, barrard, s, body, was, found, on, 19, july, 1986, at, the, foot, of, the, south, face, on, july, 28, 2024, japanese, climber, naoko, watanabe, became, the, first, woman, to, summit, k2, three, times, in, 1986, two, polish, expeditions, summited, via, two, new, routes, the, magic, line, and, the, polish, line, jerzy, kukuczka, and, tadeusz, piotrowski, piotrowski, fell, to, his, death, as, the, two, were, descending, thirteen, climbers, from, several, expeditions, died, in, the, 1986, k2, disaster, another, six, mountaineers, died, in, the, 1995, k2, disaster, while, eleven, climbers, died, in, the, 2008, k2, disaster, k2, features, several, routes, each, with, distinct, characteristics, however, they, all, share, common, challenges, the, first, is, the, extreme, altitude, which, results, in, a, significant, reduction, in, available, oxygen, at, the, summit, of, k2, only, one, third, of, the, oxygen, present, at, sea, level, is, available, to, climbers, the, second, challenge, is, the, mountain, s, tendency, to, experience, extreme, storms, lasting, several, days, which, have, resulted, in, many, of, the, deaths, on, the, peak, the, third, is, the, steep, exposed, and, demanding, nature, of, all, routes, on, the, mountain, which, makes, retreat, particularly, difficult, especially, during, storms, despite, numerous, attempts, the, first, successful, winter, ascent, occurred, only, in, 2021, all, major, climbing, routes, are, located, on, the, pakistani, side, the, base, camp, is, also, located, on, the, pakistani, side, the, standard, route, of, ascent, used, by, 75, of, all, climbers, is, the, abruzzi, spur, located, on, the, pakistani, side, first, attempted, by, prince, luigi, amedeo, duke, of, the, abruzzi, in, 1909, this, is, the, peak, s, southeast, ridge, rising, above, the, godwin, austen, glacier, the, spur, proper, begins, at, an, altitude, of, 5, 400, metres, 17, 700, ft, where, advanced, base, camp, is, usually, placed, the, route, follows, an, alternating, series, of, rock, ribs, snow, ice, fields, and, some, technical, rock, climbing, on, two, famous, features, house, s, chimney, and, the, black, pyramid, above, the, black, pyramid, the, route, continues, along, dangerously, exposed, and, difficult, to, navigate, slopes, leading, to, the, easily, visible, shoulder, and, then, on, to, the, summit, the, last, major, obstacle, is, a, narrow, couloir, known, as, the, bottleneck, which, places, climbers, dangerously, close, to, a, wall, of, seracs, that, form, an, ice, cliff, to, the, east, of, the, summit, it, was, partly, due, to, the, collapse, of, one, of, these, seracs, around, 2001, that, no, climbers, reached, the, summit, in, 2002, and, 2003, between, 1, and, 2, august, 2008, 11, climbers, from, several, expeditions, died, during, a, series, of, accidents, including, several, icefalls, in, the, bottleneck, almost, opposite, the, abruzzi, spur, is, the, north, ridge, which, ascends, the, chinese, side, of, the, peak, it, is, rarely, climbed, partly, due, to, very, difficult, access, involving, crossing, the, shaksgam, river, which, is, a, hazardous, undertaking, in, contrast, to, the, crowds, of, climbers, and, trekkers, at, the, abruzzi, basecamp, usually, at, most, two, teams, are, encamped, below, the, north, ridge, this, route, more, technically, difficult, than, the, abruzzi, ascends, a, long, steep, primarily, rock, ridge, to, high, on, the, mountain, camp, iv, the, eagle, s, nest, at, 7, 900, metres, 25, 900, ft, and, then, crosses, a, dangerously, slide, prone, hanging, glacier, by, a, leftward, climbing, traverse, to, reach, a, snow, couloir, which, accesses, the, summit, besides, the, original, japanese, ascent, a, notable, ascent, of, the, north, ridge, was, the, one, in, 1990, by, greg, child, greg, mortimer, and, steve, swenson, which, was, done, alpine, style, above, camp, 2, though, using, some, fixed, ropes, already, put, in, place, by, a, japanese, team, because, 75, of, people, who, climb, k2, use, the, abruzzi, spur, these, listed, routes, are, rarely, climbed, no, one, has, climbed, the, east, face, of, the, mountain, due, to, the, instability, of, the, snow, and, ice, formations, on, that, side, besides, the, east, face, the, north, face, has, not, yet, been, climbed, either, in, 2007, denis, urubko, and, serguey, samoilov, intended, to, climb, the, k2, s, north, face, but, they, were, stymied, by, increasingly, deteriorating, conditions, after, finding, their, intended, route, menaced, by, growing, avalanche, danger, they, traversed, onto, the, normal, north, ridge, route, and, summited, on, 2, october, 2007, making, the, latest, summer, season, ascent, of, the, peak, in, history, for, most, of, its, climbing, history, k2, was, not, usually, climbed, with, supplemental, oxygen, and, small, relatively, lightweight, teams, were, the, norm, however, the, 2004, season, saw, a, great, increase, in, the, use, of, oxygen, 28, of, 47, summiteers, used, oxygen, in, that, year, acclimatisation, is, essential, when, climbing, without, oxygen, to, avoid, some, degree, of, altitude, sickness, k2, s, summit, is, well, above, the, altitude, at,
