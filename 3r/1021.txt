appearance, of, the, city, changed, drastically, during, soviet, times, especially, as, a, result, of, joseph, stalin, s, large, scale, effort, to, modernize, moscow, stalin, s, plans, for, the, city, included, a, network, of, broad, avenues, and, roadways, some, of, them, over, ten, lanes, wide, which, while, greatly, simplifying, movement, through, the, city, were, constructed, at, the, expense, of, a, great, number, of, historical, buildings, and, districts, among, the, many, casualties, of, stalin, s, demolitions, was, the, sukharev, tower, a, longtime, city, landmark, as, well, as, mansions, and, commercial, buildings, the, city, s, newfound, status, as, the, capital, of, a, deeply, secular, nation, made, religiously, significant, buildings, especially, vulnerable, to,

cathedral, and, the, cathedral, of, christ, the, savior, during, the, 1990s, both, were, rebuilt, many, smaller, churches, however, were, lost, while, the, later, stalinist, period, was, characterized, by, the, curtailing, of, creativity, and, architectural, innovation, the, earlier, post, revolutionary, years, saw, a, plethora, of, radical, new, buildings, created, in, the, city, especially, notable, were, the, constructivist, architects, associated, with, vkhutemas, responsible, for, such, landmarks, as, lenin, s, mausoleum, another, prominent, architect, was, vladimir, shukhov, famous, for, shukhov, tower, just, one, of, many, hyperboloid, towers, designed, by, shukhov, it, was, built, between, 1919, and, 1922, as, a, transmission, tower, for, a, russian,

the, gum, department, store, on, red, square, bridged, with, innovative, metal, and, glass, vaults, perhaps, the, most, recognizable, contributions, of, the, stalinist, period, are, the, so, called, seven, sisters, seven, massive, skyscrapers, scattered, throughout, the, city, at, about, an, equal, distance, from, the, kremlin, a, defining, feature, of, moscow, s, skyline, their, imposing, form, was, allegedly, inspired, by, the, manhattan, municipal, building, in, new, york, city, and, their, style, with, intricate, exteriors, and, a, large, central, spire, has, been, described, as, stalinist, gothic, architecture, all, seven, towers, can, be, seen, from, most, high, points, in, the, city, they, are, among, the, tallest, constructions, in, central, moscow, apart, from, the, ostankino, tower, which, when, it, was, completed, in, 1967, was, the, highest, free, standing, land, structure, in, the, world, and, today, remains, the, world, s, seventy, second, tallest, ranking, among, buildings, such, as, the, burj, khalifa, in, dubai, taipei, 101, in, taiwan, and, the, cn, tower, in, toronto, the, soviet, goal, of, providing, housing, for, every, family, and, the, rapid, growth, of, moscow, s, population, led, to, the, construction, of, large, monotonous, housing, blocks, most, of, these, date, from, the, post, stalin, era, and, the, styles, are, often, named, after, the, leader, then, in, power, brezhnev, khrushchev, etc, they, are, usually, badly, maintained, although, the, city, still, has, some, five, story, apartment, buildings, constructed, before, the, mid, 1960s, more, recent, apartment, buildings, are, usually, at, least, nine, floors, tall, and, have, elevators, it, is, estimated, that, moscow, has, over, twice, as, many, elevators, as, new, york, city, and, four, times, as, many, as, chicago, moslift, one, of, the, city, s, major, elevator, operating, companies, has, about, 1500, elevator, mechanics, on, call, to, release, residents, trapped, in, elevators, stalinist, era, buildings, mostly, found, in, the, central, part, of, the, city, are, massive, and, usually, ornamented, with, socialist, realism, motifs, that, imitate, classical, themes, however, small, churches, almost, always, eastern, orthodox, found, across, the, city, provide, glimpses, of, its, past, the, old, arbat, street, a, tourist, street, that, was, once, the, heart, of, a, bohemian, area, preserves, most, of, its, buildings, from, prior, to, the, 20th, century, many, buildings, found, off, the, main, streets, of, the, inner, city, behind, the, stalinist, fa, ades, of, tverskaya, street, for, example, are, also, examples, of, bourgeois, architecture, typical, of, tsarist, times, ostankino, palace, kuskovo, uzkoye, and, other, large, estates, just, outside, moscow, originally, belong, to, nobles, from, the, tsarist, era, and, some, convents, and, monasteries, both, inside, and, outside, the, city, are, open, to, muscovites, and, tourists, attempts, are, being, made, to, restore, many, of, the, city, s, best, kept, examples, of, pre, soviet, architecture, these, restored, structures, are, easily, spotted, by, their, bright, new, colors, and, spotless, fa, ades, there, are, a, few, examples, of, notable, early, soviet, avant, garde, work, too, such, as, the, house, of, the, architect, konstantin, melnikov, in, the, arbat, area, many, of, these, restorations, were, criticized, for, alleged, disrespect, of, historical, authenticity, facadism, is, also, widely, practiced, later, examples, of, interesting, soviet, architecture, are, usually, marked, by, their, impressive, size, and, the, semi, modernist, styles, employed, such, as, with, the, novy, arbat, project, familiarly, known, as, false, teeth, of, moscow, and, notorious, for, the, wide, scale, disruption, of, a, historic, area, in, central, moscow, involved, in, the, project, plaques, on, house, exteriors, will, inform, passers, by, that, a, well, known, personality, once, lived, there, frequently, the, plaques, are, dedicated, to, soviet, celebrities, not, well, known, outside, or, often, like, with, decorated, generals, and, revolutionaries, now, both, inside, of, russia, there, are, also, many, museum, houses, of, famous, russian, writers, composers, and, artists, in, the, city, moscow, s, skyline, is, quickly, modernizing, with, several, new, towers, under, construction, in, recent, years, the, city, administration, has, been, widely, criticized, for, heavy, destruction, that, has, affected, many, historical, buildings, as, much, as, a, third, of, historic, moscow, has, been, destroyed, in, the, past, few, years, to, make, space, for, luxury, apartments, and, hotels, other, historical, buildings, including, such, landmarks, as, the, 1930, moskva, hotel, and, the, 1913, department, store, voyentorg, have, been, razed, and, reconstructed, anew, with, the, inevitable, loss, of, historical, value, critics, blame, the, government, for, not, enforcing, conservation, laws, in, the, last, 12, years, more, than, 50, buildings, with, monument, status, were, torn, down, several, of, those, dating, back, to, the, 17th, century, some, critics, also, wonder, if, the, money, used, for, the, reconstruction, of, razed, buildings, could, not, be, used, for, the, renovation, of, decaying, structures, which, include, many, works, by, architect, konstantin, melnikov, and, mayakovskaya, metro, station, some, organizations, such, as, moscow, architecture, preservation, society, and, save, europe, s, heritage, are, trying, to, draw, the, international, public, attention, to, these, problems, there, are, 96, parks, and, 18, gardens, in, moscow, including, four, botanical, gardens, there, are, 450, square, kilometres, 170, sq, mi, of, green, zones, besides, 100, square, kilometres, 39, sq, mi, of, forests, moscow, is, a, very, green, city, if, compared, to, other, cities, of, comparable, size, in, western, europe, and, north, america, this, is, partly, due, to, a, history, of, having, green, yards, with, trees, and, grass, between, residential, buildings, there, are, on, average, 27, square, meters, 290, sq, ft, of, parks, per, person, in, moscow, compared, with, 6, for, paris, 7, 5, in, london, and, 8, 6, in, new, york, gorky, park, officially, the, central, park, of, culture, and, rest, named, after, maxim, gorky,
