permanently, deny, this, transport, route, by, the, soviet, union, hampering, its, access, to, oil, and, to, supplies, via, the, persian, corridor, for, this, reason, many, amphibious, military, assaults, were, brought, about, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, other, side, from, the, banks, of, the, river, in, these, battles, the, soviet, union, was, the, main, offensive, side, while, the,

between, the, russians, and, the, mongols, to, the, east, because, of, conditions, in, german, territories, germans, responded, in, the, largest, numbers, under, the, soviet, union, a, slice, of, the, region, was, turned, into, the, volga, german, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, the, volga, widened, for, navigation, purposes, with, construction, of, huge, dams, during, the, years, of, joseph, stalin, s, industrialization, is, of, great, importance, to, inland, shipping, and, transport, in, russia, all, the, dams, in, the, river, have, been, equipped, with, large, double, ship, locks, so, that, vessels, of, considerable, dimensions, can, travel, from, the, caspian, sea, almost, to, the, upstream, end, of, the, river, connections, with, the, river, don, and, the, black, sea, are, possible, through, the, volga, don, canal, connections, with, the, lakes, of, the, north, lake, ladoga, lake, onega, saint, petersburg, and, the, baltic, sea, are, possible, through, the, volga, baltic, waterway, and, commerce, with, moscow, has, been, realised, by, the, moscow, canal, connecting, the, volga, and, the, moskva, river, this, infrastructure, has, been, designed, for, vessels, of, a, relatively, large, scale, lock, dimensions, of, 290, by, 30, metres, 951, ft, 98, ft, on, the, volga, slightly, smaller, on, some, of, the, other, rivers, and, canals, and, it, spans, many,

tankers, is, one, of, them, in, the, later, soviet, era, up, to, the, modern, times, grain, and, oil, have, been, among, the, largest, cargo, exports, transported, on, the, volga, until, recently, access, to, the, russian, waterways, was, granted, to, foreign, vessels, on, a, very, limited, scale, the, increasing, contacts, between, the, european, union, and, russia, have, led, to, new, policies, with, regard, to, the, access, to, the, russian, inland, waterways, it, is, expected, that, vessels, of, other, nations, will, be, allowed, on, russian, rivers, soon
