extremely, steep, and, difficult, to, access, on, this, side, lies, the, highest, summit, of, the, range, the, double, headed, belukha, whose, summits, reach, 4, 506, m, 14, 783, ft, and, 4, 400, m, 14, 400, ft, respectively, and, give, origin, to, several, glaciers, 30, km, 2, 12, sq, mi, and, glaciokarsts, formations, in, aggregate, area, as, of, 1911, altaians, call, it, kadyn, bazhy, but, is, also, called, uch, sumer, the, second, highest, peak, of, the, range, is, in, mongolian, part, named, kh, iten, peak, this, massive, peak, reaches, 4, 374, m, 14, 350, ft, numerous, spurs, striking, in, all, directions, from, the, sailughem, mountains, fill, up, the, space, between, that, range, and, the, lowlands, of, tomsk, such, are, the, chuya, belki, having, an, average, elevation, of, 2,

secondary, plateaus, of, lower, elevations, are, also, distinguished, by, geographers, the, valley, of, the, katun, river, begins, as, a, wild, gorge, on, the, south, west, slope, of, belukha, then, after, a, big, bend, the, river, 600, km, 370, mi, long, pierces, the, katun, belki, and, enters, a, wider, valley, lying, at, an, elevation, of, 600, 1, 100, m, 2, 000, 3, 600, ft, which, it, follows, until, it, emerges, from, the, altai, highlands, to, join, the, biya, river, here, the, two, rivers, merge, together, to, form, the, ob, river, the, next, valley, is, that, of, the, charysh, which, has, the, korgon, and, tigeretsk, range, on, one, side, and, the, talitsk, and, baschelaksk, range, on, the, other, this, too, is, very, fertile, the, altai, seen, from, this, valley, presents, the, most, romantic, scenes, including, the, small, but, deep, kolyvan, lake, at, an, altitude, of, 360, m, 1, 180, ft, which, is, surrounded, by, fantastic, granite, domes, and, towers, farther, west, the, valleys, of, the, uba, the, ulba, and, the, bukhtarma, open, south, westwards, towards, the, irtysh, the, lower, part, of, the, first, like, the, lower, valley, of, the, charysh, is, thickly, populated, in, the, valley, of, the, ulba, is, the, riddersk, mine, at, the, foot, of, the, ivanovsk, peak, 2, 060, m, 6, 760, ft, clothed, with, alpine, meadows, the, valley, of, the, bukhtarma, which, has, a, length, of, 320, km, 200, mi, also, has, its, origin, at, the, foot, of, the, belukha, and, the, kuitun, peaks, and, as, it, falls, some, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, in, about, 3, 000, km, 1, 900, mi, from, an, alpine, plateau, at, an, elevation, of, 1, 900, m, 6, 200, ft, to, the, bukhtarma, fortress, 345, m, 1, 132, ft, it, offers, the, most, striking, contrasts, of, landscape, and, vegetation, its, upper, parts, abound, in, glaciers, the, best, known, of, which, is, the, berel, which, descends, from, the, belukha, on, the, northern, side, of, the, range, which, separates, the, upper, bukhtarma, from, the, upper, katun, is, the, katun, glacier, which, after, two, ice, falls, widen, out, to, 700, 900, m, 2, 300, 3, 000, ft, from, a, grotto, in, this, glacier, bursts, tumultuously, the, katun, river, the, middle, and, lower, parts, of, the, bukhtarma, valley, have, been, colonized, since, the, 18th, century, by, runaway, russian, peasants, serfs, and, religious, schismatics, raskolniks, who, created, a, free, republic, there, on, chinese, territory, and, after, this, part, of, the, valley, was, annexed, to, russia, in, 1869, it, was, rapidly, colonized, the, high, valleys, farther, north, on, the, same, western, face, of, the, sailughem, range, are, but, little, known, their, only, visitors, being, kyrgyz, shepherds, those, of, bashkaus, chulyshman, and, chulcha, all, three, leading, to, the, alpine, lake, of, teletskoye, length, 80, km, 50, mi, maximum, width, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, elevation, 520, m, 1, 710, ft, area, 230, 8, km, 2, 89,

from, this, lake, issues, the, biya, which, joins, the, katun, at, biysk, and, then, meanders, through, the, prairies, of, the, north, west, of, the, altai, farther, north, the, altai, highlands, are, continued, in, the, kuznetsk, district, which, has, a, slightly, different, geological, aspect, but, belongs, to, the, altai, system, but, the, abakan, river, which, rises, on, the, western, shoulder, of, the, sayan, mountains, belongs, to, the, system, of, the, yenisei, the, kuznetsk, ala, tau, range, on, the, left, bank, of, the, abakan, runs, north, east, into, the, government, of, yeniseisk, while, a, complexus, of, mountains, chukchut, salair, abakan, fills, up, the, country, northwards, towards, the, trans, siberian, railway, and, westwards, towards, the, ob, the, ek, tagh, or, mongolian, altai, which, separates, the, khovd, basin, on, the, north, from, the, irtysh, basin, on, the, south, is, a, true, border, range, in, that, it, rises, in, a, steep, and, lofty, escarpment, from, the, dzungarian, depression, 470, 900, m, 1, 540, 2, 950, ft, but, descends, on, the, north, by, a, relatively, short, slope, to, the, plateau, 1, 150, 1, 680, m, 3, 770, 5, 510, ft, of, north, western, mongolia, east, of, 94, e, the, range, is, continued, by, a, double, series, of, mountain, chains, all, of, which, exhibit, less, sharply, marked, orographical, features, and, are, at, considerably, lower, elevations, the, slopes, of, the, constituent, chains, of, the, system, are, inhabited, principally, by, nomadic, kyrgyz, the, five, highest, mountains, of, the, altai, are, the, altai, sayan, ecoregion, is, located, at, the, intersection, of, the, central, asian, and, siberian, faunal, provinces, the, altai, mountains, are, home, to, a, diverse, fauna, because, of, its, different, habitats, like, steppes, northern, taigas, and, alpine, vegetation, steep, slopes, are, home, to, the, siberian, ibex, capra, sibirica, whereas, the, rare, argali, ovis, ammon, is, found, on, more, gentle, slopes, deer, are, represented, by, five, species, altai, wapiti, cervus, elaphus, sibiricus, moose, alces, alces, forest, reindeer, rangifer, tarandus, valentinae, siberian, musk, deer, moschus, moschiferus, and, siberian, roe, deer, capreolus, pygargus, moose, and, reindeer, however, are, restricted, to, the, northern, parts, of, the, mountain, range, the, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, is, found, in, the, lower, foothills, and, surrounding, lowlands, until, recently, the, mongolian, gazelle, procapra, gutturosa, was, found, in, the, russian, altai, mountains, more, specifically, in, the, chuya, river, steppe, close, to, the, mongolian, border, large, predators, are, represented, by, snow, leopards, panthera, uncia, syn, uncia, uncia, wolves, canis, lupus, lynx, lynx, lynx, and, brown, bears, ursus, arctos, in, the, northern, parts, also, by, the, wolverine, gulo, gulo, the, tien, shan, dhole, cuon, alpinus, hesperius, a, northwestern, subspecies, of, the, asiatic, wild, dog, also, lives, there, most, species, of, the, region, are, of, mongolian, origin, the, western, siberian, eagle, owl, can, be, found, in, the, western, part, of, the, mountains, until, the, 20th, century, the, caspian, tiger, panthera, tigris, tigris, was, found, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, altai, mountains, where, it, reached, lake, zaisan, and, the, black, irtysh, single, individuals, were, also, shot, further, north, for, example, close, to, barnaul, closely, related, to, the, caspian, tiger, is, the, extant, amur, tiger, which, has, the, taxonomic, name, panthera, tigris, altaica, the, wisent, was, present, in, the, altai, mountains, until, the, middle, ages, perhaps, even, until, the, 18th, century, today, there, is, a, small, herd, in, a, nursery, in, the, altai, republic, moor, frogs, are, near, bodies, of, water, as, high, up, as, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, in, the, altai, mountains, the, altai, mountains, have, retained, a, remarkably, stable, climate, changing, little, since, the, last, ice, age, in, addition, the, mix, of, mammals, has, remained, largely, the, same, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, extinct, mammoths, making, it, one, of, the, few, places, on, earth, to, retain, an, ice, age, fauna, the, altai, mountains, were, home, to, the, denisovan, branch, of, hominids, who, were, contemporaries, of, neanderthals, and, of, homo, sapiens, modern, humans, descended, from, hominids, who, reached, asia, earlier, than, modern, humans, the, denisova, hominin, dated, to, 40, 000, years, ago, was, discovered, in, the, denisova, cave, of, the, altai, mountains, in, southern, siberia, in, 2008, knowledge, of, the, denisovan, humans, derives, primarily, from, dna, evidence, and, artifacts, as, no, complete, skeletons, have, yet, been, recovered, dna, evidence, has, been, unusually, well, preserved, because, of, the, low, average, temperature, in, the, denisova, caves, neanderthal, bones, and, tools, made, by, homo, sapiens, have, also, been, found, in, the, denisova, cave, making, it, the, only, place, in, the, world, where, all, three, hominids, are, known, to, have, lived, a, dog, like, canid, from, 33, 000, years, ago, was, found, in, the, razboinichya, cave, dna, analysis, published, in, 2013, affirmed, that, it, was, more, closely, related, to, modern, dogs, than, to, wolves, the, altai, mountains, have, been, identified, as, being, the, point, of, origin, of, a, cultural, enigma, termed, the, seima, turbino, phenomenon, which, arose, during, the, bronze, age, around, the, start, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, led, to, a, rapid, and, massive, migration, of, peoples, from, the, region, into, distant, parts, of, europe, and, asia, some, historians, believe, that, the, altai, mountain, region, may, have, been, the, location, where, skiing, was, born, however, this, remains, disputed, evidence, to, support, the, claims, includes, several, cave, petroglyphs, within, the, altai, mountains, in, modern, china, that, depict, human, figures, on, skis, that, are, chasing, after, an, ibex, according, to, a, study, published, by, the, australian, rock, art, research, association, aura, in, 2016, this, rock, art, was, estimated, to, be, from, between, 4, 000, and, 5, 250, years, ago, which, consequently, meant, it, may, be, just, as, old, or, possibly, older, than, ancient, skiing, rock, art, and, artefacts, located, in, scandinavia, however, dating, petroglyphs, accurately, with, current, technology, is, very, difficult, the, oldest, known, text, that, describes, skiing, is, from, a, chinese, text, that, dates, to, the, western, han, dynasty, 206, bc, to, 24, ad, and, refers, to, skiers, in, the, altai, mountains, a, vast, area, of, 16, 178, km, 2, 6, 246, sq, mi, 2, which, incorporates, the, altai, and, katun, natural, reserves, lake, teletskoye, mount, belukha, and, the, ukok, plateau, this, area, is, designated, as, a, world, heritage, site, unesco, entitled, the, golden, mountains, of, altai, as, stated, in, the, unesco, description, of, the, site, the, region, represents, the, most, complete, sequence, of, altitudinal, vegetation, zones, in, central, siberia, from, steppe, forest, steppe, mixed, forest, subalpine, vegetation, to, alpine, vegetation, while, making, its, decision, unesco, also, cited, russian, altai, s, importance, for, preservation, of, the, globally, endangered, mammals, such, as, snow, leopard, altai, argali, and, siberian, ibex, that, live, in, these, mountains, the, uvs, nuur, basin, is, also, a, protected, site, violations, of, the, protection, status, of, argali, sheep, and, other, species, have, been, alleged, together, with, accusations, of, corruption, in, the, altaigate, scandal, the, incident, arose, from, the, death, of, several, russian, vips, in, a, helicopter, crash, early, in, 2009, purportedly, on, a, poaching, excursion, the, siberian, altai, represents, the, northernmost, region, affected, by, the, tectonic, collision, of, india, into, asia, extensive, fault, systems, run, through, the, area, including, the, kurai, fault, zone, and, the, recently, identified, tashanta, fault, zone, these, fault, systems, are, typically, thrusts, or, right, lateral, strike, slip, faults, some, of, which, are, tectonically, active, rock, types, in, the, mountains, are, typically, granites, and, metamorphic, schists, and, some, are, highly, sheared, near, to, fault, zones, geologist, victor, r, baker, has, discovered, past, cataclysmic, floods, in, the, altai, mountains, of, siberia, from, an, even, larger, glacial, lake, than, lake, missoula, which, was, once, thought, to, have, been, the, largest, ice, dammed, lake, in, the, world, although, earthquakes, are, generally, rare, occurrences, on, 27, september, 2003, a, very, large, earthquake, measuring, m, w, 7, 3, occurred, in, the, chuya, basin, area, to, the, south, of, the, altai, region, this, earthquake, and, its, aftershocks, devastated, much, of, the, region, causing, 10, 6, million, in, damage, usgs, and, wiping, out, the, village, of, beltir, authorities, cited
