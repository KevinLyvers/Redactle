main, five, oceans, division, further, subdivision, the, pacific, ocean, is, the, largest, and, deepest, of, earth, s, five, oceanic, divisions, it, extends, from, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, north, to, the, southern, ocean, or, depending, on, definition, to, antarctica, in, the, south, and, is, bounded, by, the, continents, of, asia, and, australia, in, the, west, and, the, americas, in, the, east, at, 165, 250, 000, square, kilometers, 63, 800, 000, square, miles, in, area, as, defined, with, a, southern, antarctic, border, this, largest, division, of, the, world, ocean, and, the, hydrosphere, covers, about, 46, of, earth, s, water, surface, and, about, 32, of, the, planet, s, total, surface, area, larger, than, its, entire, land, area, 148, 000, 000, km, 2, 57, 000, 000, sq, mi, the, centers, of, both, the, water, hemisphere, and, the, western, hemisphere, as, well, as, the, oceanic, pole, of, inaccessibility, are, in, the, pacific, ocean, ocean, circulation, caused, by, the, coriolis, effect, subdivides, it, into, two, largely, independent, volumes, of, water, that, meet, at, the, equator, the, north, pacific, ocean, and, the, south, pacific, ocean, or, more, loosely, the, south, seas, the, pacific, ocean, can, also, be, informally, divided, by, the, international, date, line, into, the, east, pacific, and, the, west, pacific, which, allows, it, to, be, further, divided, into, four, quadrants, namely, the, northeast, pacific, off, the, coasts, of, north, america, the, southeast, pacific, off, south, america, northwest, pacific, off, far, eastern, pacific, asia, and, the, southwest, pacific, around, oceania, the, pacific, ocean, s, mean, depth, is, 4, 000, meters, 13, 000, feet, challenger, deep, in, the, mariana, trench, located, in, the, northwestern, pacific, is, the, deepest, known, point, in, the, world, reaching, a, depth, of, 10, 928, meters, 35, 853, feet, the, pacific, also, contains, the, deepest, point, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, horizon, deep, in, the, tonga, trench, at, 10, 823, meters, 35, 509, feet, the, third, deepest, point, on, earth, the, sirena, deep, is, also, located, in, the, mariana, trench, the, western, pacific, has, many, major, marginal, seas, including, the, philippine, sea, south, china, sea, east, china, sea, sea, of, japan, sea, of, okhotsk, bering, sea, gulf, of, alaska, mar, de, grau, tasman, sea, and, the, coral, sea, in, the, early, 16th, century, spanish, explorer, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, crossed, the, isthmus, of, panama, in, 1513, and, sighted, the, great, southern, sea, which, he, named, mar, del, sur, in, spanish, afterwards, the, ocean, s, current, name, was, coined, by, portuguese, explorer, ferdinand, magellan, during, the, spanish, circumnavigation, of, the, world, in, 1521, as, he, encountered, favorable, winds, on, reaching, the, ocean, he, called, it, mar, pac, fico, which, in, portuguese, means, peaceful, sea, top, large, seas, across, the, continents, of, asia, australia, and, the, americas, more, than, 25, 000, islands, large, and, small, rise, above, the, surface, of, the, pacific, ocean, multiple, islands, were, the, shells, of, former, active, volcanoes, that, have, lain, dormant, for, thousands, of, years, close, to, the, equator, without, vast, areas, of, blue, ocean, are, a, dot, of, atolls, that, have, over, intervals, of, time, been, formed, by, seamounts, as, a, result, of, tiny, coral, islands, strung, in, a, ring, within, surroundings, of, a, central, lagoon, important, human, migrations, occurred, in, the, pacific, in, prehistoric, times, modern, humans, first, reached, the, western, pacific, in, the, paleolithic, at, around, 60, 000, to, 70, 000, years, ago, originating, from, a, southern, coastal, human, migration, out, of, africa, they, reached, east, asia, mainland, southeast, asia, the, philippines, new, guinea, and, then, australia, by, making, the, sea, crossing, of, at, least, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, between, sundaland, and, sahul, it, is, not, known, with, any, certainty, what, level, of, maritime, technology, was, used, by, these, groups, the, presumption, is, that, they, used, large, bamboo, rafts, which, may, have, been, equipped, with, some, sort, of, sail, the, reduction, in, favourable, winds, for, a, crossing, to, sahul, after, 58, 000, b, p, fits, with, the, dating, of, the, settlement, of, australia, with, no, later, migrations, in, the, prehistoric, period, the, seafaring, abilities, of, pre, austronesian, residents, of, island, south, east, asia, are, confirmed, by, the, settlement, of, buka, by, 32, 000, b, p, and, manus, by, 25, 000, b, p, journeys, of, 180, kilometres, 110, mi, and, 230, kilometres, 140, mi, are, involved, respectively, the, descendants, of, these, migrations, today, are, the, negritos, melanesians, and, indigenous, australians, their, populations, in, maritime, southeast, asia, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, later, intermarried, with, the, incoming, austronesian, settlers, from, taiwan, and, the, northern, philippines, but, also, earlier, groups, associated, with, austroasiatic, speakers, resulting, in, the, modern, peoples, of, island, southeast, asia, and, oceania, a, later, seaborne, migration, is, the, neolithic, austronesian, expansion, of, the, austronesian, peoples, austronesians, originated, from, the, island, of, taiwan, c, 3000, 1500, bce, they, are, associated, with, distinctive, maritime, sailing, technologies, notably, outrigger, boats, catamarans, lashed, lug, boats, and, the, crab, claw, sail, it, is, likely, that, the, progressive, development, of, these, technologies, were, related, to, the, later, steps, of, settlement, into, near, and, remote, oceania, starting, at, around, 2200, bce, austronesians, sailed, southwards, to, settle, the, philippines, from, probably, the, bismarck, archipelago, they, crossed, the, western, pacific, to, reach, the, marianas, islands, by, 1500, bce, as, well, as, palau, and, yap, by, 1000, bce, they, were, the, first, humans, to, reach, remote, oceania, and, the, first, to, cross, vast, distances, of, open, water, they, also, continued, spreading, southwards, and, settling, the, rest, of, maritime, southeast, asia, reaching, indonesia, and, malaysia, by, 1500, bce, and, further, west, to, madagascar, and, the, comoros, in, the, indian, ocean, by, around, 500, ce, more, recently, it, is, suggested, that, austronesians, expanded, already, earlier, arriving, in, the, philippines, already, in, 7000, bce, additional, earlier, migrations, into, insular, southeast, asia, associated, with, austroasiatic, speakers, from, mainland, southeast, asia, are, estimated, to, have, taken, place, already, in, 15000, bce, at, around, 1300, to, 1200, bce, a, branch, of, the, austronesian, migrations, known, as, the, lapita, culture, reached, the, bismarck, archipelago, the, solomon, islands, vanuatu, fiji, and, new, caledonia, from, there, they, settled, tonga, and, samoa, by, 900, to, 800, bce, some, also, back, migrated, northwards, in, 200, bce, to, settle, the, islands, of, eastern, micronesia, including, the, carolines, the, marshall, islands, and, kiribati, mixing, with, earlier, austronesian, migrations, in, the, region, this, remained, the, furthest, extent, of, the, austronesian, expansion, into, polynesia, until, around, 700, ce, when, there, was, another, surge, of, island, exploration, they, reached, the, cook, islands, tahiti, and, the, marquesas, by, 700, ce, hawai, i, by, 900, ce, rapa, nui, by, 1000, ce, and, finally, new, zealand, by, 1200, ce, austronesians, may, have, also, reached, as, far, as, the, americas, although, evidence, for, this, remains, inconclusive, the, first, contact, of, european, navigators, with, the, western, edge, of, the, pacific, ocean, was, made, by, the, portuguese, expeditions, of, ant, nio, de, abreu, and, francisco, serr, o, via, the, lesser, sunda, islands, to, the, maluku, islands, in, 1512, and, with, jorge, lvares, s, expedition, to, southern, china, in, 1513, both, ordered, by, afonso, de, albuquerque, from, malacca, the, eastern, side, of, the, ocean, was, encountered, by, spanish, explorer, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, in, 1513, after, his, expedition, crossed, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, reached, a, new, ocean, he, named, it, mar, del, sur, sea, of, the, south, or, south, sea, because, the, ocean, was, to, the, south, of, the, coast, of, the, isthmus, where, he, first, observed, the, pacific, in, 1520, navigator, ferdinand, magellan, and, his, crew, were, the, first, to, cross, the, pacific, in, recorded, history, they, were, part, of, a, spanish, expedition, to, the, spice, islands, that, would, eventually, result, in, the, first, world, circumnavigation, magellan, called, the, ocean, pac, fico, or, pacific, meaning, peaceful, because, after, sailing, through, the, stormy, seas, off, cape, horn, the, expedition, found, calm, waters, the, ocean, was, often, called, the, sea, of, magellan, in, his, honor, until, the, eighteenth, century, magellan, stopped, at, one, uninhabited, pacific, island, before, stopping, at, guam, in, march, 1521, although, magellan, himself, died, in, the, philippines, in, 1521, spanish, navigator, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, led, the, remains, of, the, expedition, back, to, spain, across, the, indian, ocean, and, round, the, cape, of, good, hope, completing, the, first, world, circumnavigation, in, 1522, sailing, around, and, east, of, the, moluccas, between, 1525, and, 1527, portuguese, expeditions, encountered, the, caroline, islands, the, aru, islands, and, papua, new, guinea, in, 1542, 43, the, portuguese, also, reached, japan, in, 1564, five, spanish, ships, carrying, 379, soldiers, crossed, the, ocean, from, mexico, led, by, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, and, colonized, the, philippines, and, mariana, islands, for, the, remainder, of, the, 16th, century, spain, maintained, military, and, mercantile, control, with, ships, sailing, from, mexico, and, peru, across, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, philippines, via, guam, and, establishing, the, spanish, east, indies, the, manila, galleons, operated, for, two, and, a, half, centuries, linking, manila, and, acapulco, in, one, of, the, longest, trade, routes, in, history, spanish, expeditions, also, arrived, at, tuvalu, the, marquesas, the, cook, islands, the, solomon, islands, vanuatu, the, marshalls, and, the, admiralty, islands, in, the, south, pacific, later, in, the, quest, for, terra, australis, the, southern, land, spanish, explorations, in, the, 17th, century, such, as, the, expedition, led, by, the, portuguese, navigator, pedro, fernandes, de,

continental, islands, high, islands, coral, reefs, and, uplifted, coral, platforms, continental, islands, lie, outside, the, andesite, line, and, include, new, guinea, the, islands, of, new, zealand, and, the, philippines, some, of, these, islands, are, structurally, associated, with, nearby, continents, high, islands, are, of, volcanic, origin, and, many, contain, active, volcanoes, among, these, are, bougainville, hawaii, and, the, solomon, islands, the, coral, reefs, of, the, south, pacific, are, low, lying, structures, that, have, built, up, on, basaltic, lava, flows, under, the, ocean, s, surface, one, of, the, most, dramatic, is, the, great, barrier, reef, off, northeastern, australia, with, chains, of, reef, patches, a, second, island, type, formed, of, coral, is, the, uplifted, coral, platform, which, is, usually, slightly, larger, than, the, low, coral, islands, examples, include, banaba, formerly, ocean, island, and, makatea, in, the, tuamotu, group, of, french, polynesia, the, volume, of, the, pacific, ocean, representing, about, 50, 1, percent, of, the, world, s, oceanic, water, has, been, estimated, at, some, 714, million, cubic, kilometers, 171, million, cubic, miles, surface, water, temperatures, in, the, pacific, can, vary, from, 1, 4, c, 29, 5, f, the, freezing, point, of, seawater, in, the, poleward, areas, to, about, 30, c, 86, f, near, the, equator, salinity, also, varies, latitudinally, reaching, a, maximum, of, 37, parts, per, thousand, in, the, southeastern, area, the, water, near, the, equator, which, can, have, a, salinity, as, low, as, 34,

temperatures, is, the, greatest, however, each, particular, basin, has, its, own, seasonal, patterns, on, a, worldwide, scale, may, is, the, least, active, month, while, september, is, the, most, active, month, november, is, the, only, month, in, which, all, the, tropical, cyclone, basins, are, active, the, pacific, hosts, the, two, most, active, tropical, cyclone, basins, which, are, the, northwestern, pacific, and, the, eastern, pacific, pacific, hurricanes, form, south, of, mexico, sometimes, striking, the, western, mexican, coast, and, occasionally, the, southwestern, united, states, between, june, and, october, while, typhoons, forming, in, the, northwestern, pacific, moving, into, southeast, and, east, asia, from, may, to, december, tropical, cyclones, also, form, in, the, south, pacific, basin, where, they, occasionally, impact, island, nations, in, the, arctic, icing, from, october, to, may, can, present, a, hazard, for, shipping, while, persistent, fog, occurs, from, june, to, december, a, climatological, low, in, the, gulf, of, alaska, keeps, the, southern, coast, wet, and, mild, during, the, winter, months, the, westerlies, and, associated, jet, stream, within, the, mid, latitudes, can, be, particularly, strong, especially, in, the, southern, hemisphere, due, to, the, temperature, difference, between, the, tropics, and, antarctica, which, records, the, coldest, temperature, readings, on, the, planet, in, the, southern, hemisphere, because, of, the, stormy, and, cloudy, conditions, associated, with, extratropical, cyclones, riding, the, jet, stream, it, is, usual, to, refer, to, the, westerlies, as, the, roaring, forties, furious, fifties, and, shrieking, sixties, according, to, the, varying, degrees, of, latitude, the, ocean, was, first, mapped, by, abraham, ortelius, he, called, it, maris, pacifici, following, ferdinand, magellan, s, description, of, it, as, a, pacific, sea, during, his, circumnavigation, from, 1519, to, 1522, to, magellan, it, seemed, much, more, calm, pacific, than, the, atlantic, the, andesite, line, is, the, most, significant, regional, distinction, in, the, pacific, a, petrologic, boundary, it, separates, the, deeper, mafic, igneous, rock, of, the, central, pacific, basin, from, the, partially, submerged, continental, areas, of, felsic, igneous, rock, on, its, margins, the, andesite, line, follows, the, western, edge, of, the, islands, off, california, and, passes, south, of, the, aleutian, arc, along, the, eastern, edge, of, the, kamchatka, peninsula, the, kuril, islands, japan, the, mariana, islands, the, solomon, islands, and, new, zealand, s, north, island, the, dissimilarity, continues, northeastward, along, the, western, edge, of, the, andes, cordillera, along, south, america, to, mexico, returning, then, to, the, islands, off, california, indonesia, the, philippines, japan, new, guinea, and, new, zealand, lie, outside, the, andesite, line, within, the, closed, loop, of, the, andesite, line, are, most, of, the, deep, troughs, submerged, volcanic, mountains, and, oceanic, volcanic, islands, that, characterize, the, pacific, basin, here, basaltic, lavas, gently, flow, out, of, rifts, to, build, huge, dome, shaped, volcanic, mountains, whose, eroded, summits, form, island, arcs, chains, and, clusters, outside, the, andesite, line, volcanism, is, of, the, explosive, type, and, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, is, the, world, s, foremost, belt, of, explosive, volcanism, the, ring, of, fire, is, named, after, the, several, hundred, active, volcanoes, that, sit, above, the, various, subduction, zones, the, pacific, ocean, is, the, only, ocean, which, is, mostly, bounded, by, subduction, zones, only, the, central, part, of, the, north, american, coast, and, the, antarctic, and, australian, coasts, have, no, nearby, subduction, zones, the, pacific, ocean, was, born, 750, million, years, ago, at, the, breakup, of, rodinia, although, it, is, generally, called, the, panthalassa, until, the, breakup, of, pangea, about, 200, million, years, ago, the, oldest, pacific, ocean, floor, is, only, around, 180, ma, old, with, older, crust, subducted, by, now, the, pacific, ocean, contains, several, long, seamount, chains, formed, by, hotspot, volcanism, these, include, the, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, and, the, louisville, ridge, the, exploitation, of, the, pacific, s, mineral, wealth, is, hampered, by, the, ocean, s, great, depths, in, shallow, waters, of, the, continental, shelves, off, the, coasts, of, australia, and, new, zealand, petroleum, and, natural, gas, are, extracted, and, pearls, are, harvested, along, the, coasts, of, australia, japan, papua, new, guinea, nicaragua, panama, and, the, philippines, although, in, sharply, declining, volume, in, some, cases, fish, are, an, important, economic, asset, in, the, pacific, the, shallower, shoreline, waters, of, the, continents, and, the, more, temperate, islands, yield, herring, salmon, sardines, snapper, swordfish, and, tuna, as, well, as, shellfish, overfishing, has, become, a, serious, problem, in, some, areas, overfishing, leads, to, depleted, fish, populations, and, closed, fisheries, causing, both, economic, and, ecologic, consequences, for, example, catches, in, the, rich, fishing, grounds, of, the, okhotsk, sea, off, the, russian, coast, have, been, reduced, by, at, least, half, since, the, 1990s, as, a, result, of, overfishing, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, is, most, susceptible, to, micro, plastic, pollution, due, to, its, proximity, to, highly, populated, countries, like, japan, and, china, the, quantity, of, small, plastic, fragments, floating, in, the, north, east, pacific, ocean, increased, a, hundredfold, between, 1972, and, 2012, the, ever, growing, great, pacific, garbage, patch, between, california, and, japan, is, three, times, the, size, of, france, an, estimated, 80, 000, metric, tons, of, plastic, inhabit, the, patch, totaling, 1, 8, trillion, pieces, marine, pollution, is, a, generic, term, for, the, harmful, entry, into, the, ocean, of, chemicals, or, particles, the, main, culprits, are, those, using, the, rivers, for, disposing, of, their, waste, the, rivers, then, empty, into, the, ocean, often, also, bringing, chemicals, used, as, fertilizers, in, agriculture, the, excess, of, oxygen, depleting, chemicals, in, the, water, leads, to, hypoxia, and, the, creation, of, a, dead, zone, marine, debris, also, known, as, marine, litter, is, human, created, waste, that, has, ended, up, floating, in, a, lake, sea, ocean, or, waterway, oceanic, debris, tends, to, accumulate, at, the, center, of, gyres, and, coastlines, frequently, washing, aground, where, it, is, known, as, beach, litter, in, addition, the, pacific, ocean, has, served, as, the, crash, site, of, satellites, including, mars, 96, fobos, grunt, and, upper, atmosphere, research, satellite, from, 1946, to, 1958, marshall, islands, served, as, the, pacific, proving, grounds, designated, by, the, united, states, and, played, host, to, a, total, of, 67, nuclear, tests, conducted, across, various, atolls, several, nuclear, weapons, were, lost, in, the, pacific, ocean, including, one, megaton, bomb, that, was, lost, during, the, 1965, philippine, sea, a, 4, incident, in, 2021, the, discharge, of, radioactive, water, from, the, fukushima, nuclear, plant, into, the, pacific, ocean, over, a, course, of, 30, years, was, approved, by, the, japanese, cabinet, the, cabinet, concluded, the, radioactive, water, would, have, been, diluted, to, drinkable, standard, apart, from, dumping, leakage, of, tritium, into, the, pacific, was, estimated, to, be, between, 20, and, 40, trillion, bqs, from, 2011, to, 2013, according, to, the, fukushima, plant, an, emerging, threat, for, the, pacific, ocean, is, the, development, of, deep, sea, mining, deep, sea, mining, is, aimed, at, extracting, manganese, nodules, that, contain, minerals, such, as, magnesium, nickel, copper, zinc, and, cobalt, the, largest, deposits, of, these, are, found, in, the, pacific, ocean, between, mexico, and, hawaii, in, the, clarion, clipperton, fracture, zone, deep, sea, mining, for, manganese, nodules, appears, to, have, drastic, consequences, for, the, ocean, it, disrupts, deep, sea, ecosystems, and, may, cause, irreversible, damage, to, fragile, marine, habitats, sediment, stirring, and, chemical, pollution, threaten, various, marine, animals, in, addition, the, mining, process, can, lead, to, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, promote, further, climate, change, preventing, deep, sea, mining, is, therefore, important, to, ensure, the, long, term, health, of, the, ocean, scientific, researchers, have, proposed, delimiting, the, boundary, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, by, two, different, natural, boundaries, by, the, shackleton, fracture, zone, and, by, the, scotia, arc, the, former, being, more, current, than, the, latter
