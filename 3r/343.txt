the, transantarctic, mountains, abbreviated, tam, comprise, a, mountain, range, of, uplifted, rock, primarily, sedimentary, in, antarctica, which, extends, with, some, interruptions, across, the, continent, from, cape, adare, in, northern, victoria, land, to, coats, land, these, mountains, divide, east, antarctica, and, west, antarctica, they, include, a, number, of, separately, named, mountain, groups, which, are, often, again, subdivided, into, smaller, ranges, the, range, was, first, sighted, by, james, clark, ross, in, 1841, at, what, was, later, named, the, ross, ice, shelf, in, his, honour, it, was, first, crossed, during, the, british, national, antarctic, expedition, of, 1901, 1904, the, mountain, range, stretches, between, the, ross, sea, and, the, weddell, sea, the, entire, width, of, antarctica, hence, the, name, with, a, total, length, of, about, 3, 500, km, 2, 000, mi, the, transantarctic, mountains, are, one, of, the, longest, mountain, ranges, on, earth, the, antarctandes, are, even, longer, having, in, common, with, the, transantarctic, mountains, the, ranges, from, cape, adare, to, the, queen, maud, mountains, but, extending, thence, through, the, whitmore, mountains, and, ellsworth, mountains, up, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, 100, 300, km, 60, 200, mi, wide, range, forms, the, boundary, between, east, antarctica, and, west, antarctica, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, bounds, the, tam, along, their, entire, length, on, the, eastern, hemisphere, side, while, the, western, hemisphere, side, of, the, range, is, bounded, by, the, ross, sea, in, victoria, land, from, cape, adare, to, mcmurdo, sound, the, ross, ice, shelf, from, mcmurdo, sound, to, near, the, scott, glacier, and, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, beyond, the, large, summits, and, dry, valleys, of, the, tam, are, some, of, the, few, places, in, antarctica, not, covered, by, ice, the, highest, of, which, rise, more, than, 4, 500, metres, 14, 800, ft, above, sea, level, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, lie, near, mcmurdo, sound, and, represent, a, special, antarctic, phenomenon, landscapes, that, are, snow, and, ice, free, due, to, the, extremely, limited, precipitation, and, ablation, of, ice, in, the, valleys, the, highest, mountain, of, the, tam, is, the, 4, 528, m, 14, 856, ft, high, mount, kirkpatrick, in, the, queen, alexandra, range, penguins, seals, and, sea, birds, live, along, the, ross, sea, coastline, in, victoria, land, while, life, in, the, interior, of, the, transantarctic, range, is, limited, to, bacteria, lichens, algae, and, fungi, forests, once, covered, antarctica, including, plentiful, wollemi, pines, and, southern, beeches, however, with, the, gradual, cooling, associated, with, the, break, up, of, gondwana, these, forests, gradually, disappeared, it, is, believed, that, the, last, trees, on, the, antarctic, continent, were, on, transantarctic, mountains, the, transantarctic, mountains, were, first, seen, by, captain, james, clark, ross, in, 1841, from, the, ross, sea, the, range, is, a, natural, barrier, that, must, be, crossed, to, reach, the, south, pole, from, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, first, crossing, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, took, place, during, the, 1902, 1904, british, national, antarctic, expedition, at, the, ross, ice, shelf, a, reconnaissance, party, under, the, command, of, albert, armitage, reached, 2, 700, m, 8, 900, ft, altitude, in, 1902, the, following, year, a, party, under, expedition, leader, robert, falcon, scott, crossed, into, east, antarctica, at, a, location, now, known, as, ferrar, glacier, named, after, the, geologist, of, the, expedition, they, explored, part, of, victoria, land, on, the, antarctic, plateau, before, returning, via, the, same, glacier, in, 1908, ernest, shackleton, s, party, crossed, the, mountains, through, the, beardmore, glacier, scott, returned, to, that, same, glacier, in, 1911, while, roald, amundsen, crossed, the, range, via, the, axel, heiberg, glacier, much, of, the, range, remained, unexplored, until, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, when, missions, such, as, operation, highjump, and, the, international, geophysical, year, igy, made, extensive, use, of, aerial, photography, and, concentrated, on, a, thorough, investigation, of, the, entire, continent, the, name, transantarctic, mountains, was, first, applied, to, this, range, in, a, 1960, paper, by, geologist, warren, b, hamilton, following, his, igy, fieldwork, it, was, subsequently, recommended, by, the, advisory, committee, on, antarctic, names, a, us, authority, on, geographic, names, in, 1962, this, purely, descriptive, label, in, contrast, to, many, other, geographic, names, on, antarctica, is, internationally, accepted, at, present, the, leverett, glacier, in, the, queen, maud, mountains, is, the, planned, route, through, the, tam, for, the, overland, supply, road, between, mcmurdo, station, and, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, the, transantarctic, mountains, are, considerably, older, than, other, mountain, ranges, of, the, continent, which, are, mainly, volcanic, in, origin, the, range, was, uplifted, during, the, opening, of, the, west, antarctic, rift, system, to, the, east, beginning, about, 65, million, years, ago, in, the, early, cenozoic, and, soon, after, became, occupied, by, glaciers, the, mountains, consist, of, sedimentary, layers, lying, upon, a, basement, of, granites, and, gneisses, the, sedimentary, layers, include, the, beacon, supergroup, sandstones, siltstones, and, coal, deposited, beginning, in, the, silurian, period, and, continuing, into, the, jurassic, in, many, places, the, beacon, supergroup, has, been, intruded, by, dikes, and, sills, of, jurassic, age, ferrar, dolerite, many, of, the, fossils, found, in, antarctica, are, from, locations, within, these, sedimentary, formations, ice, from, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, flows, through, the, transantarctic, mountains, via, a, series, of, outlet, glaciers, into, the, ross, sea, ross, ice, shelf, and, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, these, glaciers, generally, flow, perpendicular, to, the, orientation, of, the, range, and, define, subranges, and, peak, groups, it, has, been, thought, that, many, of, these, outlet, glaciers, follow, the, traces, of, large, scale, geologic, faults, however, the, ice, flow, theories, will, be, re, evaluated, in, light, of, new, data, from, recent, ice, penetrating, radar, surveys, which, revealed, the, presence, of, three, previously, unknown, deep, subglacial, valleys, affecting, the, mountainous, subglacial, topography, beneath, the, ice, divide, these, geographic, features, are, likely, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, models, and, calculations, related, to, ice, flow, through, the, transantarctic, mountain, region, in, geographic, order, from, the, ross, sea, towards, the, weddell, sea
