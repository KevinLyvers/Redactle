bodies, are, a, single, lake, that, is, by, area, the, largest, freshwater, lake, in, the, world, lake, michigan, is, the, only, great, lake, located, fully, in, the, united, states, the, other, four, are, shared, between, the, u, s, and, canada, it, is, the, world, s, largest, lake, by, area, located, fully, in, one, country, and, is, shared, from, west, to, east, by, the, u, s, states, of, wisconsin, illinois, indiana, and, michigan, ports, along, its, shores, include, chicago, illinois, gary, indiana, milwaukee, and, green, bay, wisconsin, and, muskegon, michigan, to, the, north, the, lake, is, flanked, by, long, bays, including, green, bay, in, the, northwest, and, grand, traverse, and, little, traverse, bays, in, the, northeast, the, word, michigan, is, believed, to, come, from, the, ojibwe, michi, gami, or, mishigami, meaning, great, water, some, of, the, most, well, studied, early, human, inhabitants, of, the, lake, michigan, region, were, the, hopewell, native, americans, their, culture, declined, after, 800, ad, when, for, the, following, few, hundred, years, the, region, was, the, home, of, peoples, known, as, the, late, woodland, native, americans, in, the, early, 17th, century, when, western, european, explorers, made, their, first, forays, into, the, region, they, encountered, descendants, of, the, late, woodland, native, americans, mainly, the, historic, chippewa, menominee, sauk, fox, winnebago, miami, ottawa, and, potawatomi, peoples, the, french, explorer, jean, nicolet, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, european, to, reach, lake, michigan, possibly, in, 1634, or, 1638, in, the, earliest, european, maps, of, the, region, the, name, of, lake, illinois, has, been, found, named, for, the, illinois, confederation, of, tribes, in, addition, to, that, of, michigan, during, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, the, beaver, wars, over, the, fur, trade, with, the, european, colonies, initiated, by, the, iroquois, forced, a, massive, demographic, shift, as, their, western, neighbors, fled, the, violence, the, iroquois, sought, refuge, to, the, west, and, north, of, lake, michigan, the, straits, of, mackinac, were, an, important, native, american,

waterways, leading, from, the, saint, lawrence, river, to, the, mississippi, river, and, thence, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, french, coureurs, des, bois, and, voyageurs, established, small, ports, and, trading, communities, such, as, green, bay, on, the, lake, during, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, in, the, 19th, century, lake, michigan, was, integral, to, the, development, of, chicago, and, the, midwestern, united, states, west, of, the, lake, for, example, 90, of, the, grain, shipped, from, chicago, traveled, by, ships, east, over, lake, michigan, during, the, antebellum, years, the, volume, rarely, fell, below, 50, after, the, civil, war, even, with, the, major, expansion, of, railroad, shipping, the, first, person, to, reach, the, deep, bottom, of, lake, michigan, was, j, val, klump, a, scientist, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, milwaukee, in, 1985, klump, reached, the, bottom, via, submersible, as, part, of, a, research, expedition, the, warming, of, lake, michigan, was, the, subject, of, a, 2018, report, by, purdue, university, in, each, decade, since, 1980, steady, increases, in, obscure, surface, temperature, have, occurred, this, is, likely, to, lead, to, decreasing, native, habitat, and, to, adversely, affect, native, species, survival, including, game, fish, the, milwaukee, reef, running, under, lake, michigan, from, a, point, between, milwaukee, and, racine, to, a, point, between, grand, haven, and, muskegon, divides, the, lake, into, northern, and, southern, basins, each, basin, has, a, clockwise, flow, of, water, deriving, from, rivers, and, winds, prevailing, westerly, winds, tend, to, move, the, surface, water, toward, the, east, producing, a, moderating, effect, on, the, climate, of, western, michigan, there, is, a, mean, difference, in, summer, water, temperatures, of, 5, to, 10, degrees, fahrenheit, 2, to, 5, degrees, celsius, between, the, wisconsin, and, michigan, shores, hydrologically, michigan, and, huron, are, the, same, body, of, water, sometimes, called, lake, michigan, huron, but, are, normally, considered, distinct, counted, together, it, is, the, largest, body, of, fresh, water, in, the, world, by,

century, construction, of, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, and, great, lakes, waterway, opened, the, great, lakes, to, ocean, going, vessels, but, the, wider, ocean, going, container, ships, that, were, developed, later, do, not, fit, through, the, locks, on, these, routes, which, limits, shipping, on, the, lakes, lake, freighters, are, used, on, the, lakes, that, are, too, large, to, pass, the, locks, and, enter, the, ocean, despite, their, vast, size, large, sections, of, the, great, lakes, freeze, in, winter, interrupting, most, shipping, some, icebreakers, ply, the, lakes, lake, michigan, is, connected, by, the, illinois, waterway, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, via, the, illinois, river, and, the, mississippi, river, commercial, tug, and, barge, traffic, on, these, waterways, is, heavy, pleasure, boats, can, enter, or, exit, the, great, lakes, by, way, of, the, erie, canal, and, hudson, river, in, new, york, the, erie, canal, connects, to, the, great, lakes, at, the, east, end, of, lake, erie, at, buffalo, new, york, and, at, the, south, side, of, lake, ontario, at, oswego, new, york, the, lake, fluctuates, from, month, to, month, with, the, highest, lake, levels, typically, occurring, in, summer, the, normal, high, water, mark, is, 2, 00, feet, 0, 61, m, above, datum, 577, 5, ft, 176, 0, m, in, october, 1986, lakes, michigan, and, huron, reached, their, highest, level, at, 5, 92, feet, 1, 80, m, above, datum, the, monthly, average, high, water, records, were, broken, for, several, months, in, a, row, in, 2020, lake, levels, tend, to, be, the, lowest, in, winter, the, normal, low, water, mark, is, 1, 00, foot, 30, cm, below, datum, 577, 5, ft, or, 176, 0, m, in, the, winter, of, 1964, lakes, michigan, and, huron, reached, their, lowest, level, at, 1, 38, feet, 42, cm, below, datum, as, with, the, high, water, records, monthly, low, water, records, were, set, each, month, from, february, 1964, through, january, 1965, during, this, twelve, month, period, water, levels, ranged, from, 1, 38, to, 0, 71, feet, 42, 22, cm, below, chart, datum, the, all, time, low, water, mark, was, eclipsed, in, january, 2013, in, january, 2013, lake, michigan, s, monthly,

long, term, average, and, had, declined, 17, inches, since, january, 2012, keith, kompoltowicz, chief, of, watershed, hydrology, for, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, district, office, in, detroit, explained, that, biggest, factors, leading, to, the, lower, water, levels, in, 2013, were, a, combination, of, the, lack, of, a, large, snowpack, in, the, winter, of, 2011, 2012, coupled, with, very, hot, and, dry, conditions, in, the, summer, of, 2012, since, then, water, levels, rebounded, rising, more, than, 6, feet, 1, 8, meters, to, historical, record, high, levels, lake, michigan, like, the, other, great, lakes, supplies, drinking, water, to, millions, of, people, in, bordering, areas, the, great, lakes, are, collectively, administered, by, the, conference, of, great, lakes, and, st, lawrence, governors, and, premiers, intergovernmental, organization, led, by, the, governing, chief, executives, of, the, canadian, provinces, of, ontario, and, qu, bec, and, by, the, governors, of, the, u, s, states, of, illinois, indiana, michigan, minnesota, new, york, ohio, pennsylvania, and, wisconsin, the, conference, came, into, force, in, december, 2008, with, the,

and, refineries, operate, near, the, indiana, shoreline, the, chicago, tribune, reported, that, bp, is, a, major, polluter, dumping, thousands, of, pounds, of, raw, sludge, into, the, lake, every, day, from, its, whiting, indiana, oil, refinery, in, march, 2014, bp, s, whiting, refinery, was, responsible, for, spilling, more, than, 1, 600, us, gallons, 6, 100, l, of, oil, into, the, lake, lake, michigan, has, many, beaches, the, region, is, often, referred, to, as, the, third, coast, of, the, united, states, after, those, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, pacific, ocean, the, sand, is, often, soft, and, off, white, known, as, singing, sands, because, of, the, squeaking, noise, caused, by, high, quartz, content, it, emits, when, walked, upon, some, beaches, have, sand, dunes, covered, in, green, beach, grass, and, sand, cherries, and, the, water, is, usually, clear, and, cool, between, 55, and, 80, f, 13, and, 27, c, even, in, the, late, summer, months, however, because, prevailing, westerly, winds, tend, to, move, the, surface, water, toward, the, east, there, is, a, flow, of, warmer, water, to, the, michigan, shore, in, the, summer, the, sand, dunes, located, on, the, east, shore, of, lake, michigan, are, the, largest, freshwater, dune, system, in, the, world, in, multiple, locations, along, the, shoreline, the, dunes, rise, several, hundred, feet, above, the, lake, surface, large, dune, formations, can, be, seen, in, many, state, parks, national, forests, and, national, parks, along, the, indiana, and, michigan, shoreline, some, of, the, most, expansive, and, unique, dune, formations, can, be, found, at, indiana, dunes, national, park, saugatuck, dunes, state, park, warren, dunes, state, park, hoffmaster, state, park, silver, lake, state, park, ludington, state, park, and, sleeping, bear, dunes, national, lakeshore, small, dune, formations, can, be, found, on, the, western, shore, of, lake, michigan, at, illinois, beach, state, park, and, moderate, sized, dune, formations, can, be, found, in, kohler, andrae, state, park, and, point, beach, state, forest, in, wisconsin, a, large, dune, formation, can, be, found, in, whitefish, dunes, state, park, in, wisconsin, in, the, door, peninsula, lake, michigan, beaches, in, northern, michigan, are, the, only, place, in, the, world, aside, from, a, few, inland, lakes, in, that, region, where, petoskey, stones, the, michigan, state, stone, can, be, found, the, beaches, of, the, western, coast, and, the, northernmost, part, of, the, east, coast, are, often, rocky, with, some, sandy, beaches, the, southern, and, eastern, beaches, are, typically, sandy, and, dune, covered, this, is, partly, because, of, the, prevailing, winds, from, the, west, which, also, cause, thick, layers, of, ice, to, build, on, the, eastern, shore, in, winter, the, chicago, city, waterfront, has, been, developed, for, parks, beaches, harbors, and, marinas, and, residential, developments, connected, by, the, chicago, lakefront, trail, where, there, are, no, beaches, or, marinas, stone, or, concrete, revetments, protect, the, shoreline, from, erosion, the, chicago, lakefront, is, accessible, for, about, 24, miles, 39, km, between, the, city, s, southern, and, northern, limits, along, the, lake, twelve, million, people, live, along, lake, michigan, s, shores, mainly, in, the, chicago, and, milwaukee, metropolitan, areas, the, economy, of, many, communities, in, northern, michigan, and, door, county, wisconsin, is, supported, by, tourism, with, large, seasonal, populations, attracted, by, lake, michigan, many, seasonal, residents, have, summer, homes, along, the, waterfront, and, return, to, other, homes, for, the, winter, the, southern, tip, of, the, lake, near, gary, indiana, is, heavily, industrialized, cities, on, the, shores, of, lake, michigan, include, illinois, indiana, michigan, wisconsin, the, national, park, service, maintains, the, sleeping, bear, dunes, national, lakeshore, and, indiana, dunes, national, park, parts, of, the, shoreline, are, within, the, hiawatha, national, forest, and, the, manistee, national, forest, the, manistee, national, forest, section, of, the, shoreline, includes, the, nordhouse, dunes, wilderness, the, lake, michigan, division, of, the, michigan, islands, national, wildlife, refuge, is, also, within, the, lake, as, are, the, green, bay, national, wildlife, refuge, and, the, wisconsin, shipwreck, coast, national, marine, sanctuary, there, are, numerous, state, and, local, parks, located, on, the, shores, of, the, lake, or, on, islands, within, the, lake, lake, michigan, is, home, to, a, small, variety, of, fish, species, and, other, organisms, it, was, originally, home, to, lake, whitefish, lake, trout, yellow, perch, panfish, largemouth, bass, smallmouth, bass, and, bowfin, as, well, as, some, species, of, catfish, as, a, result, of, improvements, to, the, welland, canal, in, 1918, an, invasion, of, sea, lampreys, and, overharvesting, there, has, been, a, decline, in, native, lake, trout, populations, ultimately, causing, an, increase, in, the, population, of, another, invasive, species, the, alewife, as, a, result, salmonids, including, various, strains, of, brown, trout, steelhead, rainbow, trout, coho, and, chinook, salmon, were, introduced, as, predators, in, order, to, decrease, the, wildlife, population, this, program, was, so, successful, that, the, introduced, population, of, trout, and, salmon, exploded, resulting, in, the, creation, of, a, large, sport, fishery, for, these, introduced, species, lake, michigan, is, now, stocked, annually, with, steelhead, brown, trout, and, coho, and, chinook, salmon, which, have, also, begun, natural, reproduction, in, some, lake, michigan, tributaries, however, several, introduced, invasive, species, such, as, lampreys, round, goby, zebra, mussels, and, quagga, mussels, continue, to, cause, major, changes, in, water, clarity, and, fertility, resulting, in, knock, on, changes, to, lake, michigan, s, ecosystem, threatening, the, vitality, of, native, fish, populations, fisheries, in, inland, waters, of, the, united, states, are, small, compared, to, marine, fisheries, the, largest, fisheries, are, the, landings, from, the, great, lakes, worth, about, 14, million, in, 2001, michigan, s, commercial, fishery, today, consists, mainly, of, 150, tribe, licensed, commercial, fishing, operations, through, the, chippewa, ottawa, resource, authority, and, tribes, belonging, to, the, great, lakes, indian, fish, and, wildlife, commission, which, harvest, 50, percent, of, the, great, lakes, commercial, catch, in, michigan, waters, and, 45, state, licensed, commercial, fishing, enterprises, the, prime, commercial, species, is, the, lake, whitefish, the, annual, harvest, declined, from, an, average, of, 11, million, pounds, 5, 000, 000, kg, from, 1981, through, to, 1999, to, more, recent, annual, harvests, of, 8, to, 9, 5, million, pounds, 3, 600, 000, to, 4, 300, 000, kg, the, price, for, lake, whitefish, dropped, from, 1, 04, lb, to, as, low, as, 0, 40, lb, during, periods, of, high, production, sports, fishing, includes, salmon, whitefish, smelt, lake, trout, and, walleye, as, major, catches, in, the, late, 1960s, successful, stocking, programs, for, pacific, salmon, led, to, the, development, of, lake, michigan, s, charter, fishing, industry, like, all, of, the, great, lakes, lake, michigan, is, today, used, as, a, major, mode, of, transport, for, bulk, goods, in, 2002, 162, million, net, tons, of, dry, bulk, cargo, were, moved, via, the, lakes, this, was, in, order, of, volume, iron, ore, grain, and, potash, the, iron, ore, and, much, of, the, stone, and, coal, are, used, in, the, steel, industry, there, is, also, some, shipping, of, liquid, and, containerized, cargo, but, most, container, vessels, cannot, pass, the, locks, on, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, because, the, ships, are, too, wide, the, total, amount, of, shipping, on, the, lakes, has, been, on, a, downward, trend, for, several, years, the, port, of, chicago, operated, by, the, illinois, international, port, district, has, grain, 14, million, bushels, and, bulk, liquid, 800, 000, barrels, storage, facilities, along, lake, calumet, the, central, element, of, the, port, district, calumet, harbor, is, maintained, by,
