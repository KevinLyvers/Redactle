prior, to, the, late, 7th, century, ce, few, archaeological, finds, dating, from, 1933, and, beyond, indicate, that, the, site, or, vicinity, of, shiraz, was, likely, settled, in, the, pre, islamic, era, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, bce, a, number, of, achaemenid, and, sasanian, era, remains, have, been, discovered, around, the, city, including, reliefs, at, barm, e, delak, to, the, east,

alongside, the, name, of, the, sasanian, administrative, district, of, the, area, ardashir, khwarrah, according, to, the, diplomat, and, academic, john, limbert, this, indicates, that, the, name, shiraz, is, traced, back, to, the, elamite, shirrazish, and, that, both, refer, to, a, settlement, that, existed, at, the, site, of, qasr, e, abu, nasr, interpretations, of, what, type, of, settlement, ancient, shiraz, was, vary, according, to, berney, and, ring, the, lack, of, references, to, shiraz, in, early, persian, sources, suggests, the, city, could, not, have, been, more, than, a, way, station, in, the, plain, in, which, it, lies, on, the, other, hand, according, to, abdolmajed, arfaee, achaemenid, era, shiraz, must, have, been, one, of, the, most, important, settlements, in, the, area, he, bases, this, on, its, frequent, appearance, in, the, persepolis, administrative, archives, 84, different, tablets, as, well, as, the, number, of, workers, present, in, groups, as, large, as, 490, most, textual, references, to, shiraz, involve, rations, for, workers, it, is, never, mentioned, as, a, travel, destination, arfaee, says, that, sasanian, shiraz, was, relatively, insignificant, before, its, re, foundation, in, the, early, islamic, period, according, to, john, limbert, however, shiraz, prospered, between, the, 6th, and, 8th, centuries, ce, and, was, possibly, the, administrative, center, for, the, shiraz, plain, until, the, modern, city, of, shiraz, was, founded, shiraz, was, founded, or, restored, in, 693, by, muhammad, ibn, yusuf, al, thaqafi, the, brother, of, the, umayyad, viceroy, of, the, eastern, half, of, the, caliphate, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, or, the, latter, s, kinsman, muhammad, ibn, qasim, the, arab, muslim, army, had, conquered, the, wider, region, of, fars, where, the, site, of, shiraz, is, located, in, several, expeditions, launched, from, their, garrison, town, of, basra, between, 640, and, 653, and, specifically, captured, the, immediate, area, around, shiraz, early, on, in, 641, this, area, did, not, possess, any, cities, though, there, were, a, number, of, forts, which, were, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, the, arabs, the, sasanians, held, firm, in, istakhr, their, capital, in, fars, until, the, arabs, captured, it, in, a, heavy, battle, in, 653, during, which, the, plain, of, shiraz, had, been, utilized, as, an, arab, campground, because, of, istakhr, s, deep, association, with, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, zoroastrian, religion, the, arabs, sought, to, establish, in, nearby, shiraz, a, rival, cultural, and, administrative, center, thus, during, its, initial, founding, in, 693, the, city, was, planned, to, be, much, larger, than, isfahan, however, the, initial, ambitions, were, not, realized, and, shiraz, remained, a, provincial, backwater, in, the, shadow, of, istakhr, until, at, least, the, late, 9th, century, according, to, limbert, this, is, partly, attributed, to, the, reticence, of, the, largely, zoroastrian, population, of, fars, to, inhabit, the, islamic, arab, city, as, the, population, gradually, shifted, to, islam, from, zoroastrianism, and, istakhr, concurrently, declined, shiraz, grew, into, the, practical, center, of, fars, according, to, muslim, traditional, sources, shiraz, was, used, as, a, hideout, by, three, of, the, brothers, of, the, shia, muslim, imam, ali, al, ridha, following, the, latter, s, death, in, 817, 18, and, later, by, one, of, the, brothers, sons, ali, ibn, hamza, ibn, musa, until, he, was, found, and, executed, by, the, abbasid, authorities, in, c, 835, as, abbasid, authority, waned, during, this, period, regional, dynasties, emerged, with, considerable, autonomy, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, iranian, muslim, saffarid, dynasty, under, ya, qub, ibn, al, layth, made, shiraz, the, capital, of, their, autonomous, state, which, encompassed, most, of, modern, day, iran, in, 894, ya, qub, s, brother, and, successor, amr, founded, the, city, s, first, congregational, mosque, today, known, as, the, atigh, jame, mosque, the, iranian, buyid, dynasty, under, imad, al, dawla, ali, ibn, buya, ousted, the, saffarids, in, 933, and, his, nephew, and, successor, adud, al, dawla, fana, khusraw, took, over, and, ruled, fars, between, 949, and, 983, and, added, iraq, the, seat, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, to, his, shiraz, based, domains, in, 977, the, abbasids, thenceforth, became, a, puppet, state, of, the, shiraz, based, dynasty, shiraz, developed, into, the, largest, and, most, prosperous, city, of, fars, and, an, important, economic, and, cultural, center, of, the, caliphate, adud, al, dawla, had, a, large, library, a, hospital, and, several, mosques, bazaars, caravanserais, palaces, and, gardens, built, in, the, city, while, south, of, it, he, erected, a, fortified, camp, for, his, troops, known, as, kard, fana, khusraw, in, 974, one, of, the, congregational, mosques, built, by, adud, al, dawla, has, survived, until, the, present, day, two, zoroastrian, fire, temples, also, existed, in, shiraz, catering, to, the, persians, who, had, not, converted, to, islam, one, of, adud, al, dawla, s, palaces, stretched, out, for, nearly, three, miles, and, consisted, of, 360, rooms, under, the, buyids, shiraz, was, divided, into, twelve, quarters, and, had, eight, gates, it, owed, its, economic, prosperity, to, the, booming, agricultural, trade, of, fars, the, city, largely, consumed, the, agricultural, products, of, the, province, including, grapes, linen, wool, cotton, collyrium, rose, violet, and, palm, blossom, water, it, was, also, a, market, for, rug, weavers, and, painters, to, sell, their, pricey, products, a, testament, to, the, residents, wealth, at, the, time, wine, grains, gold, and, silver, were, exported, from, the, farsi, port, cities, of, siraf, and, najairam, adud, al, dawla, patronized, scientific, medical, and, islamic, religious, research, in, shiraz, the, city, was, spared, destruction, by, the, invading, mongols, when, its, local, ruler, offered, tributes, and, submission, to, genghis, khan, shiraz, was, again, spared, by, tamerlane, when, in, 1382, the, local, monarch, shah, shoja, agreed, to, submit, to, the, invader, in, the, 13th, century, shiraz, became, a, leading, center, of, the, arts, and, letters, thanks, to, the, encouragement, of, its,
