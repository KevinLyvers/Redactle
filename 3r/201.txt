the, drake, passage, is, the, body, of, water, between, south, america, s, cape, horn, chile, argentina, and, the, south, shetland, islands, of, antarctica, it, connects, the, southwestern, part, of, the, atlantic, ocean, scotia, sea, with, the, southeastern, part, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, extends, into, the, southern, ocean, the, passage, is, named, after, the, 16th, century, english, explorer, and, privateer, sir, francis, drake, the, drake, passage, is, considered, one, of, the, most, treacherous, voyages, for, ships, to, make, currents, at, its, latitude, meet, no, resistance, from, any, landmass, and, waves, top, 40, feet, 12, m, giving, it, a, reputation, for, being, the, most, powerful, convergence, of, seas, as, the, drake, passage, is, the, narrowest, passage, choke, point, around, antarctica, its, existence, and, shape, strongly, influence, the, circulation, of, water, around, antarctica, and, the, global, oceanic, circulation, as, well, as, the, global, climate, the, bathymetry, of, the, drake, passage, plays, an, important, role, in, the, global, mixing, of, oceanic, water, in, 1525, spanish, navigator, francisco, de, hoces, discovered, the, drake, passage, while, sailing, south, from, the, entrance, of, the, strait, of, magellan, because, of, this, the, drake, passage, is, referred, to, as, the, mar, de, hoces, sea, of, hoces, in, spanish, maps, and, sources, while, almost, always, in, the, rest, of, the, spanish, speaking, countries, it, is, mostly, known, as, pasaje, de, drake, argentina, mainly, paso, drake, or, mar, de, drake, chile, mainly, the, passage, received, its, english, name, from, sir, francis, drake, during, his, raiding, expedition, after, passing, in, 1578, through, the, strait, of, magellan, with, marigold, elizabeth, and, his, flagship, golden, hind, drake, entered, the, pacific, ocean, and, was, blown, far, south, in, a, tempest, marigold, was, lost, and, elizabeth, abandoned, the, fleet, only, drake, s, golden, hind, entered, the, passage, this, incident, demonstrated, to, the, english, that, there, was, open, water, south, of, south, america, in, 1616, dutch, navigator, willem, schouten, became, the, first, to, sail, around, cape, horn, and, through, the, drake, passage, on, december, 25, 2019, a, crew, of, six, explorers, successfully, rowed, across, the, passage, becoming, the, first, in, history, to, do, so, this, accomplishment, became, the, subject, of, a, 2020, documentary, the, impossible, row, the, drake, passage, opened, when, antarctica, separated, from, south, america, due, to, plate, tectonics, however, there, is, much, debate, about, when, this, occurred, with, estimates, ranging, from, 49, to, 17, million, years, ago, ma, the, opening, had, a, major, effect, on, the, global, oceans, due, to, deep, currents, like, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, this, opening, could, have, been, a, primary, cause, of, changes, in, global, circulation, and, climate, as, well, as, the, rapid, expansion, of, antarctic, ice, sheets, because, as, antarctica, was, encircled, by, ocean, currents, it, was, cut, off, from, receiving, heat, from, warmer, regions, the, 800, kilometre, wide, 500, mi, passage, between, cape, horn, and, livingston, island, is, the, shortest, crossing, from, antarctica, to, another, landmass, the, boundary, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, is, sometimes, taken, to, be, a, line, drawn, from, cape, horn, to, snow, island, 130, kilometres, 81, mi, north, of, mainland, antarctica, though, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, it, as, the, meridian, that, passes, through, cape, horn, 67, 16, w, both, lines, lie, within, the, drake, passage, the, other, two, passages, around, the, southern, extremity, of, south, america, the, strait, of, magellan, and, the, beagle, channel, have, frequent, narrows, leaving, little, maneuvering, room, for, a, ship, as, well, as, unpredictable, winds, and, tidal, currents, most, sailing, ships, thus, prefer, the, drake, passage, which, is, open, water, for, hundreds, of, miles, no, significant, land, sits, at, the, latitudes, of, the, drake, passage, this, is, important, to, the, unimpeded, eastward, flow, of, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, which, carries, a, huge, volume, of, water, through, the, passage, and, around, antarctica, the, passage, hosts, whales, dolphins, and, seabirds, including, giant, petrels, other, petrels, albatrosses, and, penguins, the, presence, of, the, drake, passageway, allows, the, three, main, ocean, basins, atlantic, pacific, and, indian, to, be, connected, via, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, the, strongest, oceanic, current, with, an, estimated, transport, of, 100, 150, sv, sverdrups, million, m, 3, s, this, flow, is, the, only, large, scale, exchange, occurring, between, the, global, oceans, and, the, drake, passage, is, the, narrowest, passage, on, its, flow, around, antarctica, as, such, a, significant, amount, of, research, has, been, done, in, understanding, how, the, shape, of, the, drake, passage, bathymetry, and, width, affects, the, global, climate, major, features, of, the, modern, ocean, s, temperature, and, salinity, fields, including, the, overall, thermal, asymmetry, between, the, hemispheres, the, relative, saltiness, of, deep, water, formed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, existence, of, a, transequatorial, conveyor, circulation, develop, after, drake, passage, is, opened, the, importance, of, an, open, drake, passage, extends, farther, than, the, southern, ocean, latitudes, the, roaring, forties, and, the, furious, fifties, blow, around, antarctica, and, drive, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, as, a, result, of, ekman, transport, water, gets, transported, northward, from, the, acc, on, the, left, hand, side, while, facing, the, stream, direction, using, a, lagrangian, approach, water, parcels, passing, through, the, drake, passage, can, be, followed, in, their, journey, in, the, oceans, around, 23, sv, of, water, is, transported, from, the, drake, passage, to, the, equator, mainly, in, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, this, value, is, not, far, from, the, gulf, stream, transport, in, the, florida, strait, 33, sv, but, is, an, order, of, magnitude, lower, than, the, transport, of, the, acc, 100, 150, sv, water, transported, from, the, southern, ocean, to, the, northern, hemisphere, contributes, to, the, global, mass, balance, and, permits, the, meridional, circulation, across, the, oceans, several, studies, have, linked, the, current, shape, of, the, drake, passage, to, an, effective, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, models, have, been, run, with, different, widths, and, depths, of, the, drake, passage, and, consequent, changes, in, the, global, oceanic, circulation, and, temperature, distribution, have, been, analyzed, it, appears, that, the, conveyor, belt, of, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, appears, only, in, presence, of, an, open, drake, passage, subject, to, wind, forcing, with, a, closed, drake, passage, there, is, no, north, atlantic, deep, water, nadw, cell, and, no, acc, with, a, shallower, drake, passage, a, weak, acc, appears, but, still, no, nadw, cell, it, has, also, been, shown, that, present, day, distribution, of, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, can, be, obtained, only, with, an, open, drake, passage, regarding, the, global, surface, temperature, an, open, and, sufficiently, deep, drake, passage, cools, the, southern, ocean, and, warms, the, high, latitudes, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, isolation, of, antarctica, by, the, acc, that, can, flow, only, with, an, open, drake, passage, is, credited, by, many, researchers, with, causing, the, glaciation, of, the, continent, and, global, cooling, in, the, eocene, epoch, diapycnal, mixing, is, the, process, by, which, different, layers, of, a, stratified, fluid, mix, it, directly, affects, vertical, gradients, thus, it, is, of, great, importance, to, all, gradient, driven, types, of, transport, and, circulation, including, thermohaline, circulation, mixing, drives, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, without, internal, mixing, cooler, water, would, never, rise, above, warmer, water, and, there, would, be, no, density, buoyancy, driven, circulation, however, mixing, in, the, interior, of, most, of, the, ocean, is, thought, to, be, ten, times, weaker, than, required, to, support, the, global, circulation, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, the, extra, mixing, can, be, ascribed, to, breaking, of, internal, waves, lee, waves, when, a, stratified, fluid, reaches, an, internal, obstacle, a, wave, is, created, that, can, eventually, break, mixing, the, fluid, s, layers, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, diapycnal, diffusivity, in, the, drake, passage, is, 20, times, the, value, immediately, to, the, west, in, the, pacific, sector, of, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, much, of, the, energy, that, is, dissipated, through, internal, wave, breaking, around, 20, of, the, wind, energy, put, into, the, ocean, is, dissipated, in, the, southern, ocean, in, short, without, the, coarse, topography, in, the, depths, of, the, drake, passage, oceanic, internal, mixing, would, be, weaker, and, the, global, circulation, would, be, affected, worldwide, satellite, measurements, of, oceanic, properties, have, been, available, since, the, 1980s, before, then, data, could, be, only, gathered, through, oceanic, ships, taking, direct, measurements, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, has, been, and, is, surveyed, making, repeated, transects, south, america, and, the, antarctic, peninsula, constrain, the, acc, in, the, drake, passage, the, convenience, of, measuring, the, acc, across, the, passage, lays, in, the, clear, boundaries, of, the, current, in, that, stripe, even, after, the, advent, of, satellite, altimetry, data, direct, observations, in, the, drake, passage, have, not, lost, their, exceptionality, the, relative, shallowness, and, narrowness, of, the, passage, makes, it, particularly, suitable, to, assess, the, validity, of, horizontally, and, vertically, changing, quantities, such, as, velocity, in, ekman, s, theory, in, addition, the, strength, of, the, acc, makes, meanders, and, pinching, cold, core, cyclonic, rings, easier, to, observe, wildlife, in, the, drake, passage, includes, the, following, species, 58, 35, s, 65, 54, w, 58, 583, s, 65, 900, w, 58, 583,
