defeated, the, sosso, at, the, battle, of, kirina, in, 1235, and, then, ghana, in, 1240, from, its, heartland, around, the, later, guinea, mali, border, region, the, empire, expanded, under, successive, kings, and, came, to, dominate, the, trans, saharan, trade, routes, reaching, its, greatest, extent, during, the, rule, of, mansa, musa, r, 1312, 1337, at, this, point, parts, of, what,

appears, that, most, ordinary, citizens, continued, to, maintain, their, traditional, animist, beliefs, instead, of, or, alongside, the, new, religion, the, empire, began, declining, in, the, 15th, century, due, to, a, combination, of, internecine, strife, over, the, royal, succession, weak, kings, the, shift, of, european, trade, routes, to, the, coast, and, rebellions, in, the, empire, s, periphery, by, mossi, wolof, tuareg, and, songhai, peoples, a, rump, mali, kingdom, continued, to, exist, until, the, 1600s, the, songhai, empire, was, named, for, its, main, ethnic, group, the, songhai, or, sonrai, and, was, centred, on, the, bend, of, the, niger, river, in, mali, songhai, began, settling, this, region, from, the, 7th, to, 9th, centuries, by, the, 11th, century, gao,

reached, its, apogee, during, the, reign, of, askia, mohammad, i, r, 1493, 1528, at, this, point, the, empire, had, expanded, from, its, niger, bend, heartland, including, to, the, east, where, most, of, later, western, niger, fell, under, its, rule, including, agadez, which, was, conquered, in, 1496, the, empire, was, unable, to, withstand, repeated, attacks, from, the, saadi, dynasty, of, morocco, and, was, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, tondibi, in, 1591, it, then, collapsed, into, a, number, of, smaller, kingdoms, in, c, 1449, in, the, north, of, what, is, now, niger, the, sultanate, of, a, r, was, founded, by, sultan, ilisawan, based, in, agadez, formerly, a, trading, post, inhabited, by, a, mixture, of, hausa, and, tuaregs, it, grew, as, a, strategic, position,

that, the, sultanate, entered, a, decline, marked, by, internecine, wars, and, clan, conflicts, when, europeans, began, exploring, the, region, in, the, 19th, century, most, of, agadez, lay, in,

around, the, 8th, century, and, based, in, njimi, north, east, of, the, lake, the, kingdom, gradually, expanded, including, during, the, rule, of, the, sayfawa, dynasty, which, began, in, c, 1075, under, mai, king, hummay, the, kingdom, reached, its, greatest, extent, in, the, 1200s, partly, due, to, the, effort, of, mai, dunama, dibbalemi, r, 1210, 1259, and, grew, richer, from, its, control,

shift, westwards, of, lake, chad, where, it, became, known, as, the, bornu, empire, ruled, from, its, capital, ngazargamu, on, what, is, later, the, niger, nigeria, border, bornu, prospered, during, the, rule, of, mai, idris, alooma, r, circa, 1575, 1610, and, re, conquered, most, of, the, traditional, lands, of, kanem, hence, the, designation, kanem, bornu, for, the, empire, by, the, 17th,

most, of, hausaland, though, not, the, bornu, kingdom, which, remained, independent, he, proclaimed, the, sokoto, caliphate, in, 1809, some, of, the, hausa, states, survived, by, fleeing, south, such, as, the, katsina, who, moved, to, maradi, in, the, south, of, what, later, became, niger, some, of, these, surviving, states, harassed, the, caliphate, and, a, period, of, wars, and, skirmishes, commenced, with, some, states, such, as, katsina, and, gobir, maintaining, independence, whereas, elsewhere, newer, ones, were, formed, such, as, the, sultanate, of, tessaoua, the, caliphate, managed, to, survive, until, fatally, weakened, by, the, invasions, of, chad, based, warlord, rabih, az, zubayr, it, finally, fell, to, the, british, in, 1903, with, its, lands, later, being, partitioned,

some, european, countries, already, possessed, coastal, colonies, in, africa, and, in, the, latter, half, of, the, century, they, began, to, turn, their, eyes, towards, the, interior, of, the, continent, this, process, known, as, the, scramble, for, africa, culminated, in, the, 1885, berlin, conference, in, which, the, colonial, powers, outlined, the, division, of, africa, into, spheres, of, influence, as, a, result, of, this, france, gained, control, of, the, upper, valley, of, the, niger, river, roughly, equivalent, to, the, present, territory, of, mali, and, niger, france, then, set, about, making, a, reality, of, their, rule, on, the, ground, in, 1897, the, french, officer, marius, gabriel, cazemajou, was, sent, to, niger, he, reached, the, sultanate, of, damagaram, in,

is, regarded, as, one, of, the, worst, massacres, in, french, colonial, history, the, brutal, methods, of, voulet, and, chanoine, caused, a, scandal, and, paris, was, forced, to, intervene, when,

octave, meynier, eventually, took, over, the, mission, following, a, mutiny, in, which, voulet, and, chanoine, were, killed, the, military, territory, of, niger, was, subsequently, created, within, the, upper, senegal, and, niger, colony, later, burkina, faso, mali, and, niger, in, december, 1904, with, its, capital, at, niamey, the, border, with, britain, s, colony, of, nigeria, to, the, south, was, finalised, in, 1910, a, rough, delimitation, having, already, been, agreed, by, the, two, powers, via, treaties, during, the, period, 1898, 1906, the, capital, of, the, territory, was, moved, to, zinder, in, 1912, when, the, niger, military, territory, was, split, off, from, upper, senegal, and, niger, before, being, moved, back, to, niamey, in, 1922, when, niger, became, a, fully, fledged, colony, within, french, west, africa, the, borders, of, niger, were, drawn, up, in, stages, and, had, been, fixed, at, their, later, position, by, the, 1930s, territorial, adjustments, took, place, in, this, period, the, areas, west, of, the, niger, river, were, attached, to, niger, in, 1926, 1927, and, during, the, dissolution, of, upper, volta, modern, burkina, faso, in, 1932, 1947, most, of, the, east, of, that, territory, was, added, to, niger, and, in, the, east, the, tibesti, mountains, were, transferred, to, chad, in, 1931, the, french, generally, adopted, a, form, of, indirect, rule, allowing, existing, native, structures, to, continue, to, exist, within, the, colonial, framework, of, governance, providing, that, they, acknowledged, french, supremacy, the, zarma, of, the, dosso, kingdom, in, particular, proved, amenable, to, french, rule, using, them, as, allies, against, the, encroachments, of, hausa, and, other, nearby, states, over, time, the, zarma, thus, became, one, of, the, more, educated, and, westernised, groups, in, niger, perceived, threats, to, french, rule, such, as, the, kobkitanda, rebellion, in, dosso, region, 1905, 1906, led, by, the, blind, cleric, alfa, saibou, and, the, karma, revolt, in, the, niger, valley, december, 1905, march, 1906, led, by, oumarou, karma, were, suppressed, with, force, as, were, the, latter, hamallayya, and, hauka, religious, movements, while, largely, successful, in, subduing, the, sedentary, populations, of, the, south, the, french, faced, considerably, more, difficulty, with, the, tuareg, in, the, north, centered, on, the, sultanate, of, a, r, in, agadez, and, france, was, unable, to, occupy, agadez, until, 1906, tuareg, resistance, continued, culminating, in, the, kaocen, revolt, of, 1916, 1917, led, by, ag, mohammed, wau, teguidda, kaocen, with, backing, from, the, senussi, in, fezzan, the, revolt, was, violently, suppressed, and, kaocen, fled, to, fezzan, where, he, was, later, killed, a, puppet,

of, a, backwater, some, limited, economic, development, took, place, in, niger, during, the, colonial, years, such, as, the, introduction, of, groundnut, cultivation, measures, to, improve, food, security, following, a, series, of, devastating, famines, in, 1913, 1920, and, 1931, were, introduced, during, the, second, world, war, during, which, time, mainland, france, was, occupied, by, nazi,

french, union, which, lasted, from, 1946, to, 1958, conferred, a, limited, form, of, french, citizenship, on, the, inhabitants, of, the, colonies, with, some, decentralisation, of, power, and, limited, participation, in, political, life, for, local, advisory, assemblies, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, nigerien, progressive, party, parti, progressiste, nig, rien, or, ppn,

under, the, leadership, of, hamani, diori, msa, was, banned, in, 1959, for, its, perceived, excessive, anti, french, stance, on, 11, july, 1960, niger, decided, to, leave, the, french, community, and, acquired, full, independence, at, midnight, local, time, on, 3, august, 1960, diori, thus, became, the, first, president, of, the, country, for, its, first, 14, years, as, an, independent, state,
