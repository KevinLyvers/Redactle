subcontinent, including, most, of, modern, day, northern, and, eastern, india, most, of, eastern, pakistan, virtually, all, of, bangladesh, and, southern, plains, of, nepal, also, known, as, the, indus, ganga, plain, the, region, is, named, after, the, indus, and, the, ganges, rivers, and, encompasses, a, number, of, large, urban, areas, the, plain, is, bounded, on, the, north, by, the, himalayas, which, feed, its, numerous, rivers, and, are, the, source, of, the, fertile, alluvium, deposited, across, the, region, by, the, two, river, systems, the, southern, edge, of, the, plain, is, marked, by, the, deccan, plateau, on, the, west, rises, the, iranian, plateau, many, developed, cities, like, delhi, dhaka, kolkata, lahore, islamabad, and, karachi, are, located, in, the, indo, gangetic, plain, the, region, is, known, for, the, indus, valley, civilisation, which, was, the, first, ancient, culture, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, flat, and, fertile, terrain, has,

but, also, firmly, established, a, muslim, presence, by, the, 13th, century, following, the, battle, the, delhi, sultanate, became, prominent, in, the, region, and, collapse, of, organised, rajput, resistance, in, northern, india, led, to, muslim, control, of, the, region, within, a, generation, the, indo, gangetic, plain, is, divided, into, two, drainage, basins, by, the, delhi, ridge, the, western, part, drains, to, the, indus, and, the, eastern, part, consists, of, the, ganga, brahmaputra, drainage, systems, this, divide, is, only, 350, metres, above, sea, level, causing, the, perception, that, the, indo, gangetic, plain, appears, to, be, continuous, from, sindh, in, the, west, to, bengal, and, assam, in, the, east, a, thin, strip, between, the, foothills, of, the, himalayas, and, the, plain, the, bhabar, is, a, region, of, porous, ground, consisting, of, boulders, and, pebbles, that, have, washed, down, from, the, mountains, it, is, not, suitable, for, crops, and, is, forested, the, streams, disappear, underground, here, below, the, bhabar, lie, the, grasslands, of, terai, and, dooars, the, many, tributaries, of, the, indus, river, and, the, ganga, river, divide, the, plain, into, doabs, tongues, of, land, that, extend, to, where, the, tributaries, meet, close, to, the, rivers, is, khadar, land, of, new, alluvium, that, is, subject, to, flooding, above, the, flood, limit, bangar, land, is, older, alluvium, deposited, in, the, middle, pleistocene, the, annual, rainfall, increases, from, west, towards, the, east, the, lower, ganges, plains, and, the, assam, valley, are, more, verdant, than, the, middle, ganga, plain, the, lower, ganga, is, centered, in, west, bengal, from, which, it, flows, into, bangladesh, after, joining, the, jamuna, a, distributary, of, brahmaputra, both, rivers, form, the, ganges, delta, the, brahmaputra, rises, in, tibet, as, the, yarlung, zangbo, river, and, flows, through, arunachal, pradesh, and, assam, before, crossing, into, bangladesh, some, geographers, subdivide, the, indo, gangetic, plain, into, several, parts, the, gujarat, sindh, punjab, doab, rohilkhand, awadh, bihar, bengal, and, assam, regions, roughly, the, indo, gangetic, plain, stretches, across, the, fertile, terai, region, is, spread, across, southern, nepal, and, northern, eastern, india, along, the, foothills, of, the, himalayas, the, rivers, encompassed, are, the, beas, the, chambal, the, chenab, the, ganga, the, gomti, the, indus, the, ravi, the, sutlej, and, the, yamuna, the, soil, is, rich, in, silt, making, the, plain, one, of, the, most, intensely, farmed, areas, of, the, world, even, rural, areas, here, are, densely, populated, the, indus, ganga, plains, also, known, as, the, great, indian, plains, are, large, floodplains, of, the, indus, ganga, and, brahmaputra, river, systems, they, run, parallel, to, the, himalaya, mountains, from, jammu, and, kashmir, and, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, in, the, west, to, assam, in, the, east, and, draining, most, of, northern, and, eastern, india, the, plains, encompass, an, area, of, 700, 000, km, 2, 270, 000, sq, mi, and, vary, in, width, through, their, length, by, several, hundred, kilometres, the, major, rivers, of, this, system, are, the, ganga, and, the, indus, along, with, their, tributaries, beas, yamuna, gomti, ravi, chambal, sutlej, and, chenab, the, indus, ganga, belt, is, the, world, s, most, extensive, expanse, of, uninterrupted, alluvium, formed, by, the, deposition, of, silt, by, the, numerous, rivers, the, plains, are, flat, and, mostly, treeless, making, it, conducive, for, irrigation, through, canals, the, area, is, also, rich, in, ground, water, sources, the, plains, are, the, world, s, most, intensely, farmed, areas, the, main, crops, grown, are, rice, and, wheat, that, are, grown, in, rotation, others, include, maize, sugarcane, and, cotton, sustaining, 9, to, 14, of, the, global, population, across, various, studies, the, indo, gangetic, plains, rank, among, the, world, s, most, densely, populated, areas, until, recent, history, the, open, grasslands, of, the, indus, ganga, plain, were, inhabited, by, several, large, species, of, animal, the, open, plains, were, home, to, large, numbers, of, herbivores, which, included, all, three, of, the, asian, rhinoceros, indian, rhinoceros, javan, rhinoceros, sumatran, rhinoceros, the, open, grasslands, were, in, many, ways, similar, to, the, landscape, of, modern, africa, gazelle, buffalo, rhinos, elephants, lions, and, hippo, roamed, the, grasslands, as, they, do, in, africa, today, large, herds, of, indian, elephants, gazelles, antelopes, and, horses, lived, alongside, several, species, of, wild, cattle, including, the, now, extinct, aurochs, in, the, forested, areas, there, were, several, species, of, wild, pig, deer, and, muntjac, in, the, wetter, regions, close, to, the, ganga, there, would, have, been, large, herds, of, water, buffalo, grazing, on, the, riverbanks, along, with, extinct, species, of, hippopotamus, so, many, large, animals, would, have, supported, a, large, population, of, predators, as, well, indian, wolves, dholes, striped, hyenas, asiatic, cheetahs, and, asiatic, lions, would, have, hunted, large, game, on, the, open, plains, while, bengal, tigers, and, leopards, would, stalk, prey, in, the, surrounding, woods, and, sloth, bears, hunt, for, termites, in, both, of, these, areas, in, the, ganges, there, were, large, concentrations, of, gharial, mugger, crocodile, and, river, dolphin, controlling, fish, stocks, and, the, occasional, migrating, herd, crossing, the, river, farming, on, the, indus, ganga, plain, primarily, consists, of, rice, and, wheat, grown, in, crop, rotation, other, crops, include, maize, millets, barley, sugarcane, and, cotton, the, main, source, of, rainfall, is, the, southwest, monsoon, which, is, normally, sufficient, for, general, agriculture, the, many, rivers, flowing, out, of, the, himalayas, provide, water, for, major, irrigation, works, due, to, a, rapidly, growing, population, as, well, as, other, factors, this, area, is, considered, at, high, risk, for, water, shortages, in, the, future, the, area, constitutes, the, land, between, the, brahmaputra, river, and, the, aravalli, range, the, ganga, and, other, rivers, such, as, the, yamuna, the, ghaghara, and, the, chambal, river, flow, through, the, area, because, it, is, not, fully, possible, to, define, the, boundaries, of, the, indo, gangetic, plain, it, is, also, difficult, to, give, an, exact, list, of, which, administrative, areas, are, part, of, the, plain, the, areas, that, are, completely, or, more, than, half, in, the, plain, are, 27, 15, n, 80, 30, e, 27, 25, n, 80, 5, e, 27, 25, 80, 5
