the, southern, alps, m, ori, k, tiritiri, o, te, moana, officially, southern, alps, k, tiritiri, o, te, moana, are, a, mountain, range, extending, along, much, of, the, length, of, new, zealand, s, south, island, reaching, its, greatest, elevations, near, the, range, s, western, side, the, name, southern, alps, generally, refers, to, the, entire, range, although, separate, names, are, given, to, many, of, the, smaller, ranges, that, form, part, of, it, the, range, includes, the, south, island, s, main, divide, which, separates, the, water, catchments, of, the, more, heavily, populated, eastern, side, of, the, island, from, those, on, the, west, coast, politically, the, main, divide, forms, the, boundary, between, the, marlborough, canterbury, and, otago, regions, to, the, southeast, and, the, tasman, and, west, coast, regions, to, the, northwest, the, m, ori, name, of, the, range, is, k, tiritiri, o, te, moana, meaning, the, mirage, of, the, ocean, the, english, explorer, james, cook, bestowed, the, name, southern, alps, on, 23, march, 1770, admiring, their, prodigious, height, they, had, previously, been, noted, by, abel, tasman, in, 1642, whose, description, of, the, south, island, s, west, coast, is, often, translated, as, a, land, uplifted, high, following, the, passage, of, the, ng, i, tahu, claims, settlement, act, 1998, the, official, name, of, the, range, was, updated, to, southern, alps, k, tiritiri, o, te, moana, the, southern, alps, run, approximately, 500, km, northeast, to, southwest, its, tallest, peak, is, aoraki, mount, cook, the, highest, point, in, new, zealand, at, 3, 724, metres, 12, 218, ft, the, southern, alps, include, sixteen, other, points, that, exceed, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, in, height, see, nz, mountains, by, height, the, mountain, ranges, are, bisected, by, glacial, valleys, many, of, which, are, infilled, with, glacial, lakes, on, the, eastern, side, including, lake, coleridge, in, the, north, and, lake, wakatipu, in, otago, in, the, south, according, to, an, inventory, conducted, in, the, late, 1970s, the, southern, alps, contained, over, 3, 000, glaciers, larger, than, one, hectare, the, longest, of, which, the, tasman, glacier, is, 23, 5, kilometres, 14, 6, mi, in, length, which, has, retreated, from, a, recent, maximum, of, 29, kilometres, 18, mi, in, the, 1960s, settlements, include, maruia, springs, a, spa, near, lewis, pass, the, town, of, arthur, s, pass, and, mount, cook, village, major, crossings, of, the, southern, alps, in, the, new, zealand, road, network, include, lewis, pass, sh, 7, arthur, s, pass, sh, 73, haast, pass, sh, 6, and, the, road, to, milford, sound, sh, 94, new, zealand, has, a, humid, maritime, temperate, climate, with, the, southern, alps, lying, perpendicular, to, the, prevailing, westerly, flow, of, air, annual, precipitation, varies, greatly, across, the, range, from, 3, 000, millimetres, 120, in, at, the, west, coast, 15, 000, millimetres, 590, in, close, to, the, main, divide, to, 1, 000, millimetres, 39, in, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, east, of, the, main, divide, this, high, precipitation, aids, the, growth, of, glaciers, above, the, snow, line, large, glaciers, and, snowfields, can, be, found, west, of, or, on, the, main, divide, with, smaller, glaciers, farther, east, see, glaciers, of, new, zealand, because, of, its, orientation, perpendicular, to, the, prevailing, westerly, winds, the, range, creates, excellent, wave, soaring, conditions, for, glider, pilots, the, town, of, omarama, in, the, lee, of, the, mountains, has, gained, an, international, reputation, for, its, gliding, conditions, the, prevailing, westerlies, also, create, a, weather, pattern, known, as, the, nor, west, arch, in, which, moist, air, is, pushed, up, over, the, mountains, forming, an, arch, of, cloud, in, an, otherwise, blue, sky, this, weather, pattern, is, frequently, visible, in, summer, across, canterbury, and, north, otago, the, nor, wester, is, a, foehn, wind, similar, to, the, chinook, of, canada, where, mountain, ranges, in, the, path, of, prevailing, moisture, laden, winds, force, air, upwards, thus, cooling, the, air, and, condensing, the, moisture, to, rain, producing, hot, dry, winds, in, the, descending, air, lee, of, the, mountains, the, southern, alps, lie, along, a, geological, plate, boundary, part, of, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, with, the, pacific, plate, to, the, southeast, pushing, westward, and, colliding, with, the, northward, moving, indo, australian, plate, to, the, northwest, over, the, last, 45, million, years, the, collision, has, pushed, up, a, 20, km, thickness, of, rocks, on, the, pacific, plate, to, form, the, alps, although, much, of, this, has, been, eroded, away, uplift, has, been, most, rapid, during, the, last, 5, million, years, and, the, mountains, continue, to, be, raised, today, by, tectonic, pressure, causing, earthquakes, on, the, alpine, fault, and, other, nearby, faults, despite, the, substantial, uplift, most, of, the, relative, motion, along, the, alpine, fault, is, transverse, not, vertical, however, significant, dip, slip, occurs, on, the, plate, boundary, to, the, north, and, east, of, the, north, island, in, the, hikurangi, trough, and, kermadec, trench, the, transfer, of, motion, from, strike, slip, on, the, alpine, fault, to, dip, slip, motion, at, these, subduction, zones, to, the, north, creates, the, marlborough, fault, system, which, has, resulted, in, significant, uplift, in, the, region, in, 2017, a, large, international, team, of, scientists, reported, they, had, discovered, beneath, whataroa, a, small, township, on, the, alpine, fault, extreme, hydrothermal, activity, which, could, be, commercially, very, significant, the, mountains, are, rich, in, flora, with, about, 25, of, the, country, s, plant, species, being, found, above, the, treeline, in, alpine, plant, habitats, and, grassland, with, mountain, beech, forest, at, lower, elevations, of, the, eastern, side, but, not, in, westland, the, cold, windswept, slopes, above, the, treeline, are, covered, with, areas, of, fellfield, to, the, east, the, alps, descend, to, the, canterbury, otago, tussock, grasslands, plants, adapted, to, the, alpine, conditions, include, woody, shrubs, like, hebe, dracophyllum, and, coprosma, the, conifer, snow, totara, podocarpus, nivalis, and, carex, sedge, grasses, wildlife, of, the, mountains, includes, the, endemic, rock, wren, xenicus, gilviventris, there, are, also, a, number, of, endemic, insects, adapted, to, these, high, altitudes, like, flies, moths, beetles, bees, and, the, mountain, stone, w, t, which, can, freeze, solid, over, winter, to, survive, the, alpine, conditions, the, beech, forests, of, the, lower, elevations, are, important, habitat, for, several, birds, such, as, the, great, spotted, kiwi, apteryx, haastii, the, south, island, k, k, nestor, meridionalis, meridionalis, and, the, orange, fronted, k, k, riki, cyanoramphus, malherbi, the, kea, can, be, found, in, the, forested, foothills, as, well, as, higher, colder, elevations, it, is, the, world, s, only, alpine, parrot, and, was, once, hunted, as, a, pest, the, mountains, are, inaccessible, and, retain, their, natural, vegetation, a, large, proportion, of, the, range, is, well, protected, by, national, parks, notably, the, westland, tai, poutini, national, park, mount, aspiring, national, park, and, aoraki, mount, cook, national, park, or, by, protected, areas, such, as, lake, sumner, forest, park, indigenous, plant, life, is, affected, by, introduced, animals, such, as, red, deer, cervus, elaphus, chamois, rupicapra, rupicapra, and, himalayan, tahr, hemitragus, jemlahicus, all, of, which, have, at, times, been, targeted, for, culling, likewise, native, birds, and, reptiles, are, vulnerable, to, introduced, predators
