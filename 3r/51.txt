the, norwegian, sea, norwegian, norskehavet, icelandic, noregshaf, faroese, norskahavi, is, a, marginal, sea, grouped, with, either, the, atlantic, ocean, or, the, arctic, ocean, northwest, of, norway, between, the, north, sea, and, the, greenland, sea, adjoining, the, barents, sea, to, the, northeast, in, the, southwest, it, is, separated, from, the, atlantic, ocean, by, a, submarine, ridge, running, between, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, to, the, north, the, jan, mayen, ridge, separates, it, from, the, greenland, sea, unlike, many, other, seas, most, of, the, bottom, of, the, norwegian, sea, is, not, part, of, a, continental, shelf, and, therefore, lies, at, a, great, depth, of, about, two, kilometres, on, average, rich, deposits, of, oil, and, natural, gas, are, found, under, the, sea, bottom, and, are, being, explored, commercially, in, the, areas, with, sea, depths, of, up, to, about, one, kilometre, the, coastal, zones, are, rich, in, fish, that, visit, the, norwegian, sea, from, the, north, atlantic, or, barents, sea, cod, for, spawning, the, warm, north, atlantic, current, ensures, relatively, stable, and, high, water, temperatures, so, that, unlike, the, arctic, seas, the, norwegian, sea, is, ice, free, throughout, the, year, recent, research, has, concluded, that, the, large, volume, of, water, in, the, norwegian, sea, with, its, large, heat, absorption, capacity, is, more, important, as, a, source, of, norway, s, mild, winters, than, the, gulf, stream, and, its, extensions, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, norwegian, sea, as, follows, the, norwegian, sea, was, formed, about, 250, million, years, ago, when, the, eurasian, plate, of, norway, and, the, north, american, plate, including, greenland, started, to, move, apart, the, existing, narrow, shelf, sea, between, norway, and, greenland, began, to, widen, and, deepen, the, present, continental, slope, in, the, norwegian, sea, marks, the, border, between, norway, and, greenland, as, it, stood, approximately, 250, million, years, ago, in, the, north, it, extends, east, from, svalbard, and, on, the, southwest, between, britain, and, the, faroes, this, continental, slope, contains, rich, fishing, grounds, and, numerous, coral, reefs, settling, of, the, shelf, after, the, separation, of, the, continents, has, resulted, in, landslides, such, as, the, storegga, slide, about, 8, 000, years, ago, that, induced, a, major, tsunami, the, coasts, of, the, norwegian, sea, were, shaped, during, the, last, ice, age, large, glaciers, several, kilometres, high, pushed, into, the, land, forming, fjords, removing, the, crust, into, the, sea, and, thereby, extending, the, continental, slopes, this, is, particularly, clear, off, the, norwegian, coast, along, helgeland, and, north, to, the, lofoten, islands, the, norwegian, continental, shelf, is, between, 40, and, 200, kilometres, wide, and, has, a, different, shape, from, the, shelves, in, the, north, sea, and, barents, sea, it, contains, numerous, trenches, and, irregular, peaks, which, usually, have, an, amplitude, of, less, than, 100, metres, but, can, reach, up, to, 400, metres, they, are, covered, with, a, mixture, of, gravel, sand, and, mud, and, the, trenches, are, used, by, fish, as, spawning, grounds, deeper, into, the, sea, there, are, two, deep, basins, separated, by, a, low, ridge, its, deepest, point, at, 3, 000, m, between, the, v, ring, plateau, and, jan, mayen, island, the, southern, basin, is, larger, and, deeper, with, large, areas, between, 3, 500, and, 4, 000, metres, deep, the, northern, basin, is, shallower, at, 3, 200, 3, 300, metres, but, contains, many, individual, sites, going, down, to, 3, 500, metres, submarine, thresholds, and, continental, slopes, mark, the, borders, of, these, basins, with, the, adjacent, seas, to, the, south, lies, the, european, continental, shelf, and, the, north, sea, to, the, east, is, the, eurasian, continental, shelf, with, the, barents, sea, to, the, west, the, scotland, greenland, ridge, separates, the, norwegian, sea, from, the, north, atlantic, this, ridge, is, on, average, only, 500, metres, deep, only, in, a, few, places, reaching, the, depth, of, 850, metres, to, the, north, lie, the, jan, mayen, ridge, and, mohns, ridge, which, lie, at, a, depth, of, 2, 000, metres, with, some, trenches, reaching, depths, of, about, 2, 600, metres, four, major, water, masses, originating, in, the, atlantic, and, arctic, oceans, meet, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, the, associated, currents, are, of, fundamental, importance, for, the, global, climate, the, warm, salty, north, atlantic, current, flows, in, from, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, colder, and, less, saline, norwegian, current, originates, in, the, north, sea, the, so, called, east, iceland, current, transports, cold, water, south, from, the, norwegian, sea, toward, iceland, and, then, east, along, the, arctic, circle, this, current, occurs, in, the, middle, water, layer, deep, water, flows, into, the, norwegian, sea, from, the, greenland, sea, the, tides, in, the, sea, are, semi, diurnal, that, is, they, rise, twice, a, day, to, a, height, of, about, 3, 3, metres, the, hydrology, of, the, upper, water, layers, is, largely, determined, by, the, flow, from, the, north, atlantic, it, reaches, a, speed, of, 10, sv, 1, sv, million, m, 3, s, and, its, maximum, depth, is, 700, metres, at, the, lofoten, islands, but, normally, it, is, within, 500, metres, part, of, it, comes, through, the, faroe, shetland, channel, and, has, a, comparatively, high, salinity, of, 35, 3, parts, per, thousand, this, current, originates, in, the, north, atlantic, current, and, passes, along, the, european, continental, slope, increased, evaporation, due, to, the, warm, european, climate, results, in, the, elevated, salinity, another, part, passes, through, the, greenland, scotland, trench, between, the, faroe, islands, and, iceland, this, water, has, a, mean, salinity, between, 35, and, 35, 2, the, flow, shows, strong, seasonal, variations, and, can, be, twice, as, high, in, winter, as, in, summer, while, at, the, faroe, shetland, channel, it, has, a, temperature, of, about, 9, 5, c, it, cools, to, about, 5, c, at, svalbard, and, releases, this, energy, about, 250, terawatts, to, the, environment, the, current, flowing, from, the, north, sea, originates, in, the, baltic, sea, and, thus, collects, most, of, the, drainage, from, northern, europe, this, contribution, is, however, relatively, small, the, temperature, and, salinity, of, this, current, show, strong, seasonal, and, annual, fluctuations, long, term, measurements, within, the, top, 50, metres, near, the, coast, show, a, maximum, temperature, of, 11, 2, c, at, the, 63, n, parallel, in, september, and, a, minimum, of, 3, 9, c, at, the, north, cape, in, march, the, salinity, varies, between, 34, 3, and, 34, 6, and, is, lowest, in, spring, owing, to, the, inflow, of, melted, snow, from, rivers, the, largest, rivers, discharging, into, the, sea, are, namsen, ranelva, and, vefsna, they, are, all, relatively, short, but, have, a, high, discharge, rate, owing, to, their, steep, mountainous, nature, a, portion, of, the, warm, surface, water, flows, directly, within, the, west, spitsbergen, current, from, the, atlantic, ocean, off, the, greenland, sea, to, the, arctic, ocean, this, current, has, a, speed, of, 3, 5, sv, and, has, a, large, impact, on, the, climate, other, surface, water, 1, sv, flows, along, the, norwegian, coast, in, the, direction, of, the, barents, sea, this, water, may, cool, enough, in, the, norwegian, sea, to, submerge, into, the, deeper, layers, there, it, displaces, water, that, flows, back, into, the, north, atlantic, arctic, water, from, the, east, iceland, current, is, mostly, found, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, sea, near, greenland, its, properties, also, show, significant, annual, fluctuations, with, long, term, average, temperature, being, below, 3, c, and, salinity, between, 34, 7, and, 34, 9, the, fraction, of, this, water, on, the, sea, surface, depends, on, the, strength, of, the, current, which, in, turn, depends, on, the, pressure, difference, between, the, icelandic, low, and, azores, high, the, larger, the, difference, the, stronger, the, current, the, norwegian, sea, is, connected, with, the, greenland, sea, and, the, arctic, ocean, by, the, 2, 600, metre, deep, fram, strait, the, norwegian, sea, deep, water, nsdw, occurs, at, depths, exceeding, 2, 000, metres, this, homogeneous, layer, with, a, salinity, of, 34, 91, experiences, little, exchange, with, the, adjacent, seas, its, temperature, is, below, 0, c, and, drops, to, 1, c, at, the, ocean, floor, compared, with, the, deep, waters, of, the, surrounding, seas, nsdw, has, more, nutrients, but, less, oxygen, and, is, relatively, old, the, weak, deep, water, exchange, with, the, atlantic, ocean, is, due, to, the, small, depth, of, the, relatively, flat, greenland, scotland, ridge, between, scotland, and, greenland, an, offshoot, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, only, four, areas, of, the, greenland, scotland, ridge, are, deeper, than, 500, metres, the, faroe, bank, channel, about, 850, metres, some, parts, of, the, iceland, faroe, ridge, about, 600, metres, the, wyville, thomson, ridge, 620, metres, and, areas, between, greenland, and, the, denmark, strait, 850, metres, this, is, much, shallower, than, the, norwegian, sea, cold, deep, water, flows, into, the, atlantic, through, various, channels, about, 1, 9, sv, through, the, faroe, bank, channel, 1, 1, sv, through, the, iceland, faroe, channel, and, 0, 1, sv, via, the, wyville, thomson, ridge, the, turbulence, that, occurs, when, the, deep, water, falls, behind, the, greenland, scotland, ridge, into, the, deep, atlantic, basin, mixes, the, adjacent, water, layers, and, forms, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, one, of, two, major, deep, sea, currents, providing, the, deep, ocean, with, oxygen, the, thermohaline, circulation, affects, the, climate, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, the, regional, climate, can, significantly, deviate, from, average, there, is, also, a, difference, of, about, 10, c, between, the, sea, and, the, coastline, temperatures, rose, between, 1920, and, 1960, and, the, frequency, of, storms, decreased, in, this, period, the, storminess, was, relatively, high, between, 1880, and, 1910, decreased, significantly, in, 1910, 1960, and, then, recovered, to, the, original, level, in, contrast, to, the, greenland, sea, and, arctic, seas, the, norwegian, sea, is, ice, free, year, round, owing, to, its, warm, currents, the, convection, between, the, relatively, warm, water, and, cold, air, in, the, winter, plays, an, important, role, in, the, arctic, climate, the, 10, degree, july, isotherm, air, temperature, line, runs, through, the, northern, boundary, of, the, norwegian, sea, and, is, often, taken, as, the, southern, boundary, of, the, arctic, in, winter, the, norwegian, sea, generally, has, the, lowest, air, pressure, in, the, entire, arctic, and, where, most, icelandic, low, depressions, form, the, water, temperature, in, most, parts, of, the, sea, is, 2, 7, c, in, february, and, 8, 12, c, in, august, the, norwegian, sea, is, a, transition, zone, between, boreal, and, arctic, conditions, and, thus, contains, flora, and, fauna, characteristic, of, both, climatic, regions, the, southern, limit, of, many, arctic, species, runs, through, the, north, cape, iceland, and, the, center, of, the, norwegian, sea, while, the, northern, limit, of, boreal, species, lies, near, the, borders, of, the, greenland, sea, with, the, norwegian, sea, and, barents, sea, that, is, these, areas, overlap, some, species, like, the, scallop, chlamys, islandica, and, capelin, tend, to, occupy, this, area, between, the, atlantic, and, arctic, oceans, most, of, the, aquatic, life, in, the, norwegian, sea, is, concentrated, in, the, upper, layers, estimates, for, the, entire, north, atlantic, are, that, only, 2, of, biomass, is, produced, at, depths, below, 1, 000, metres, and, only, 1, 2, occurs, near, the, sea, floor, the, blooming, of, the, phytoplankton, is, dominated, by, chlorophyll, and, peaks, around, 20, may, the, major, phytoplankton, forms, are, diatoms, in, particular, the, genus, thalassiosira, and, chaetoceros, after, the, spring, bloom, the, haptophytes, of, the, genus, phaecocystis, pouchetti, become, dominant, zooplankton, is, mostly, represented, by, the, copepods, calanus, finmarchicus, and, calanus, hyperboreus, where, the, former, occurs, about, four, times, more, often, than, the, latter, and, is, mostly, found, in, the, atlantic, streams, whereas, c, hyperboreus, dominates, the, arctic, waters, they, are, the, main, diet, of, most, marine, predators, the, most, important, krill, species, are, meganyctiphanes, norvegica, thyssanoessa, inermis, and, thyssanoessa, longicaudata, in, contrast, to, the, greenland, sea, there, is, a, significant, presence, of, calcareous, plankton, coccolithophore, and, globigerinida, in, the, norwegian, sea, plankton, production, strongly, fluctuates, between, years, for, example, c, finmarchicus, yield, was, 28, g, m, 2, dry, weight, in, 1995, and, only, 8, g, m, 2, in, 1997, this, correspondingly, affected, the, population, of, all, its, predators, shrimp, of, the, species, pandalus, borealis, play, an, important, role, in, the, diet, of, fish, particularly, cod, and, blue, whiting, and, mostly, occur, at, depths, between, 200, and, 300, metres, a, special, feature, of, the, norwegian, sea, is, extensive, coral, reefs, of, lophelia, pertusa, which, provide, shelter, to, various, fish, species, although, these, corals, are, widespread, in, many, peripheral, areas, of, the, north, atlantic, they, never, reach, such, amounts, and, concentrations, as, at, the, norwegian, continental, slopes, however, they, are, at, risk, due, to, increasing, trawling, which, mechanically, destroys, the, coral, reefs, the, norwegian, coastal, waters, are, the, most, important, spawning, ground, of, the, herring, populations, of, the, north, atlantic, and, the, hatching, occurs, in, march, the, eggs, float, to, the, surface, and, are, washed, off, the, coast, by, the, northward, current, whereas, a, small, herring, population, remains, in, the, fjords, and, along, the, northern, norwegian, coast, the, majority, spends, the, summer, in, the, barents, sea, where, it, feeds, on, the, rich, plankton, upon, reaching, puberty, herring, returns, to, the, norwegian, sea, the, herring, stock, varies, greatly, between, years, it, increased, in, the, 1920s, owing, to, the, milder, climate, and, then, collapsed, in, the, following, decades, until, 1970, the, decrease, was, however, at, least, partly, caused, by, overfishing, the, biomass, of, young, hatched, herring, declined, from, 11, million, tonnes, in, 1956, to, almost, zero, in, 1970, that, affected, the, ecosystem, not, only, of, the, norwegian, sea, but, also, of, the, barents, sea, enforcement, of, environmental, and, fishing, regulations, has, resulted, in, partial, recovery, of, the, herring, populations, since, 1987, this, recovery, was, accompanied, by, a, decline, of, capelin, and, cod, stocks, while, the, capelin, benefited, from, the, reduced, fishing, the, temperature, rise, in, the, 1980s, and, competition, for, food, with, the, herring, resulted, in, a, near, disappearance, of, young, capelin, from, the, norwegian, sea, meanwhile, the, elderly, capelin, population, was, quickly, fished, out, this, also, reduced, the, population, of, cod, a, major, predator, of, capelin, as, the, herring, was, still, too, small, in, numbers, to, replace, the, capelin, in, the, cod, s, diet, blue, whiting, micromesistius, poutassou, has, benefited, from, the, decline, of, the, herring, and, capelin, stocks, as, it, assumed, the, role, of, major, predator, of, plankton, the, blue, whiting, spawns, near, the, british, isles, the, sea, currents, carry, their, eggs, to, the, norwegian, sea, and, the, adults, also, swim, there, to, benefit, from, the, food, supply, the, young, spend, the, summer, and, the, winter, until, february, in, norwegian, coastal, waters, and, then, return, to, the, warmer, waters, west, of, scotland, the, norwegian, arctic, cod, mostly, occurs, in, the, barents, sea, and, at, the, svalbard, archipelago, in, the, rest, of, the, norwegian, sea, it, is, found, only, during, the, reproduction, season, at, the, lofoten, islands, whereas, pollachius, virens, and, haddock, spawn, in, the, coastal, waters, mackerel, is, an, important, commercial, fish, the, coral, reefs, are, populated, by, different, species, of, the, genus, sebastes, significant, numbers, of, minke, humpback, sei, and, orca, whales, are, present, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, white, beaked, dolphins, occur, in, the, coastal, waters, orcas, and, some, other, whales, visit, the, sea, in, the, summer, months, for, feeding, their, population, is, closely, related, to, the, herring, stocks, and, they, follow, the, herring, schools, within, the, sea, with, a, total, population, of, about, 110, 000, minke, whales, are, by, far, the, most, common, whales, in, the, sea, they, are, hunted, by, norway, and, iceland, with, a, quota, of, about, 1, 000, per, year, in, norway, in, contrast, to, the, past, nowadays, primarily, their, meat, is, consumed, rather, than, fat, and, oil, the, bowhead, whale, used, to, be, a, major, plankton, predator, but, it, almost, disappeared, from, the, norwegian, sea, after, intense, whaling, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, temporarily, extinct, in, the, entire, north, atlantic, similarly, the, blue, whale, used, to, form, large, groups, between, jan, mayen, and, spitsbergen, but, is, hardly, present, nowadays, observations, of, northern, bottlenose, whales, in, the, norwegian, sea, are, rare, other, large, animals, of, the, sea, are, hooded, and, harp, seals, and, squid, important, waterfowl, species, of, the, norwegian, sea, are, puffin, kittiwake, and, guillemot, puffins, and, guillemots, also, suffered, from, the, collapse, of, the, herring, population, especially, the, puffins, on, the, lofoten, islands, the, latter, hardly, had, an, alternative, to, herring, and, their, population, was, approximately, halved, between, 1969, and, 1987, norway, iceland, and, denmark, faroe, islands, share, the, territorial, waters, of, the, norwegian, sea, with, the, largest, part, belonging, to, the, first, norway, has, claimed, twelve, mile, limit, as, territorial, waters, since, 2004, and, an, exclusive, economic, zone, of, 200, miles, since, 1976, consequently, due, to, the, norwegian, islands, of, svalbard, and, jan, mayen, the, southeast, northeast, and, northwest, edge, of, the, sea, fall, within, norway, the, southwest, border, is, shared, between, iceland, and, denmark, faroe, islands, according, to, the, f, royingas, ga, norse, settlers, arrived, on, the, islands, around, the, 8th, century, king, harald, fairhair, is, credited, with, being, the, driving, force, to, colonize, these, islands, as, well, as, others, in, the, norwegian, sea, the, largest, damage, to, the, norwegian, sea, was, caused, by, extensive, fishing, whaling, and, pollution, other, contamination, is, mostly, by, oil, and, toxic, substances, but, also, from, the, great, number, of, ships, sunk, during, the, two, world, wars, the, environmental, protection, of, the, norwegian, sea, is, mainly, regulated, by, the, ospar, convention, fishing, has, been, practised, near, the, lofoten, archipelago, for, hundreds, of, years, the, coastal, waters, of, the, remote, lofoten, islands, are, one, of, the, richest, fishing, areas, in, europe, as, most, of, the, atlantic, cod, swims, to, the, coastal, waters, of, lofoten, in, the, winter, to, spawn, so, in, the, 19th, century, dried, cod, was, one, of, norway, s, main, exports, and, by, far, the, most, important, industry, in, northern, norway, strong, sea, currents, maelstroms, and, especially, frequent, storms, made, fishing, a, dangerous, occupation, several, hundred, men, died, on, the, fatal, monday, in, march, 1821, 300, of, them, from, a, single, parish, and, about, a, hundred, boats, with, their, crews, were, lost, within, a, short, time, in, april, 1875, over, the, last, century, the, norwegian, sea, has, been, suffering, from, overfishing, in, 2018, 41, of, stocks, were, excessively, harvested, two, out, of, sixteen, of, the, total, allowed, catches, tacs, agreed, upon, by, the, european, union, eu, and, norway, follow, scientific, advice, nine, of, those, tacs, are, at, least, 25, above, scientific, advice, while, the, other, five, are, set, above, scientific, evidence, when, excluding, landing, obligation, under, the, common, fisheries, policy, cfp, the, eu, committed, to, phase, out, overfishing, by, 2015, 2020, at, the, absolute, latest, as, of, 2019, the, eu, was, reported, to, not, be, on, path, to, achieving, that, goal, whaling, was, also, important, for, the, norwegian, sea, in, the, early, 1600s, the, englishman, stephen, bennet, started, hunting, walrus, at, bear, island, in, may, 1607, the, muscovy, company, while, looking, for, the, northwest, passage, and, exploring, the, sea, discovered, the, large, populations, of, walrus, and, whales, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, started, hunting, them, in, 1610, near, spitsbergen, later, in, the, 17th, century, dutch, ships, started, hunting, bowhead, whales, near, jan, mayen, the, bowhead, population, between, svalbard, and, jan, mayen, was, then, about, 25, 000, individuals, britons, and, dutch, were, then, joined, by, germans, danes, and, norwegians, between, 1615, and, 1820, the, waters, between, jan, mayen, svalbard, bear, island, and, greenland, between, the, norwegian, greenland, and, barents, seas, were, the, most, productive, whaling, area, in, the, world, however, extensive, hunting, had, wiped, out, the, whales, in, that, region, by, the, early, 20th, century, for, many, centuries, the, norwegian, sea, was, regarded, as, the, edge, of, the, known, world, the, disappearance, of, ships, there, due, to, the, natural, disasters, induced, legends, of, monsters, that, stopped, and, sank, ships, kraken, as, late, as, in, 1845, the, encyclop, dia, metropolitana, contained, a, multi, page, review, by, erik, pontoppidan, 1698, 1764, on, ship, sinking, sea, monsters, half, a, mile, in, size, many, legends, might, be, based, on, the, work, historia, de, gentibus, septentrionalibus, of, 1539, by, olaus, magnus, which, described, the, kraken, and, maelstroms, of, the, norwegian, sea, the, kraken, also, appears, in, alfred, tennyson, s, poem, of, the, same, name, in, herman, melville, s, moby, dick, and, in, twenty, thousand, leagues, under, the, seas, by, jules, verne, between, the, lofoten, islands, of, moskenes, ya, and, v, r, ya, at, the, tiny, mosken, island, lies, the, moskenstraumen, a, system, of, tidal, eddies, and, a, whirlpool, called, a, maelstrom, with, a, speed, on, the, order, of, 15, km, h, 9, mph, the, value, strongly, varies, between, sources, it, is, one, of, the, strongest, maelstroms, in, the, world, it, was, described, in, the, 13th, century, in, the, old, norse, poetic, edda, and, remained, an, attractive, subject, for, painters, and, writers, including, edgar, allan, poe, walter, moers, and, jules, verne, the, word, was, introduced, into, the, english, language, by, poe, in, his, story, a, descent, into, the, maelstr, m, 1841, describing, the, moskenstraumen, the, moskenstraumen, is, created, as, a, result, of, a, combination, of, several, factors, including, the, tides, the, position, of, the, lofoten, and, the, underwater, topography, unlike, most, other, whirlpools, it, is, located, in, the, open, sea, rather, than, in, a, channel, or, bay, with, a, diameter, of, 40, 50, metres, it, can, be, dangerous, even, in, modern, times, to, small, fishing, vessels, that, might, be, attracted, by, the, abundant, cod, feeding, on, the, microorganisms, sucked, in, by, the, whirlpool, the, fish, rich, coastal, waters, of, northern, norway, have, long, been, known, and, attracted, skilled, sailors, from, iceland, and, greenland, thus, most, settlements, in, iceland, and, greenland, were, on, the, west, coasts, of, the, islands, which, were, also, warmer, due, to, the, atlantic, currents, the, first, reasonably, reliable, map, of, northern, europe, the, carta, marina, of, 1539, represents, the, norwegian, sea, as, coastal, waters, and, shows, nothing, north, of, the, north, cape, the, norwegian, sea, off, the, coast, regions, appeared, on, the, maps, in, the, 17th, century, as, an, important, part, of, the, then, sought, northern, sea, route, and, a, rich, whaling, ground, jan, mayen, island, was, discovered, in, 1607, and, become, an, important, base, of, dutch, whalers, the, dutchman, willem, barents, discovered, bear, island, and, svalbard, which, was, then, used, by, russian, whalers, called, pomors, the, islands, on, the, edge, of, the, norwegian, sea, have, been, rapidly, divided, between, nations, during, the, peaks, of, whaling, some, 300, ships, with, 12, 000, crew, members, were, yearly, visiting, svalbard, the, first, depth, measurements, of, the, norwegian, sea, were, performed, in, 1773, by, constantine, phipps, aboard, hms, racehorse, as, a, part, of, his, north, pole, expedition, systematic, oceanographic, research, in, the, norwegian, sea, started, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, declines, in, the, yields, of, cod, and, herring, off, the, lofoten, prompted, the, norwegian, government, to, investigate, the, matter, the, zoologist, georg, ossian, sars, and, meteorologist, henrik, mohn, persuaded, the, government, in, 1874, to, send, out, a, scientific, expedition, and, between, 1876, and, 1878, they, explored, much, of, the, sea, aboard, v, ringen, the, data, obtained, allowed, mohn, to, establish, the, first, dynamic, model, of, ocean, currents, which, incorporated, winds, pressure, differences, sea, water, temperature, and, salinity, and, agreed, well, with, later, measurements, in, 2019, deposits, of, iron, copper, zink, and, cobalt, were, found, on, the, mohn, ridge, likely, from, hydrothermal, vents, until, the, 20th, century, the, coasts, of, the, norwegian, sea, were, sparsely, populated, and, therefore, shipping, in, the, sea, was, mostly, focused, on, fishing, whaling, and, occasional, coastal, transportation, since, the, late, 19th, century, the, norwegian, coastal, express, sea, line, has, been, established, connecting, the, more, densely, populated, south, with, the, north, of, norway, by, at, least, one, trip, a, day, the, importance, of, shipping, in, the, norwegian, sea, also, increased, with, the, expansion, of, the, russian, and, soviet, navies, in, the, barents, sea, and, development, of, international, routes, to, the, atlantic, through, the, baltic, sea, kattegat, skagerrak, and, north, sea, the, norwegian, sea, is, ice, free, and, provides, a, direct, route, from, the, atlantic, to, the, russian, ports, in, the, arctic, murmansk, arkhangelsk, and, kandalaksha, which, are, directly, linked, to, central, russia, this, route, was, extensively, used, for, supplies, during, world, war, ii, of, 811, us, ships, 720, reached, russian, ports, bringing, some, 4, million, tonnes, of, cargo, that, included, about, 5, 000, tanks, and, 7, 000, aircraft, the, allies, lost, 18, convoys, and, 89, merchant, ships, on, this, route, the, major, operations, of, the, german, navy, against, the, convoys, included, pq, 17, in, july, 1942, the, battle, of, the, barents, sea, in, december, 1942, and, the, battle, of, the, north, cape, in, december, 1943, and, were, carried, out, around, the, border, between, the, norwegian, sea, and, barents, sea, near, the, north, cape, navigation, across, the, norwegian, sea, declined, after, world, war, ii, and, intensified, only, in, the, 1960s, 70s, with, the, expansion, of, the, soviet, northern, fleet, which, was, reflected, in, major, joint, naval, exercises, of, the, soviet, northern, baltic, fleets, in, the, norwegian, sea, the, sea, was, the, gateway, for, the, soviet, navy, to, the, atlantic, ocean, and, thus, to, the, united, states, and, the, major, soviet, port, of, murmansk, was, just, behind, the, border, of, the, norwegian, and, barents, sea, the, countermeasures, by, the, nato, countries, resulted, in, a, significant, naval, presence, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, intense, cat, and, mouse, games, between, soviet, and, nato, aircraft, ships, and, especially, submarines, a, relic, of, the, cold, war, in, the, norwegian, sea, the, soviet, nuclear, submarine, k, 278, komsomolets, sank, in, 1989, southwest, of, bear, island, at, the, border, of, the, norwegian, and, barents, seas, with, radioactive, material, onboard, that, poses, potential, danger, to, flora, and, fauna, the, norwegian, sea, is, part, of, the, northern, sea, route, for, ships, from, european, ports, to, asia, the, travel, distance, from, rotterdam, to, tokyo, is, 21, 100, km, 13, 111, mi, via, the, suez, canal, and, only, 14, 100, km, 8, 761, mi, through, the, norwegian, sea, sea, ice, is, a, common, problem, in, the, arctic, seas, but, ice, free, conditions, along, the, entire, northern, route, were, observed, at, the, end, of, august, 2008, russia, is, planning, to, expand, its, offshore, oil, production, in, the, arctic, which, should, increase, the, traffic, of, tankers, through, the, norwegian, sea, to, markets, in, europe, and, america, it, is, expected, that, the, number, of, oil, shipments, through, the, northern, norwegian, sea, will, increase, from, 166, in, 2002, to, 615, in, 2015, the, most, important, products, of, the, norwegian, sea, are, no, longer, fish, but, oil, and, especially, gas, found, under, the, ocean, floor, norway, started, undersea, oil, production, in, 1993, followed, by, development, of, the, huldra, gas, field, in, 2001, the, large, depth, and, harsh, waters, of, the, norwegian, sea, pose, significant, technical, challenges, for, offshore, drilling, whereas, drilling, at, depths, exceeding, 500, metres, has, been, conducted, since, 1995, only, a, few, deep, gas, fields, have, been, explored, commercially, the, most, important, current, project, is, ormen, lange, depth, 800, 1, 100, m, where, gas, production, started, in, 2007, with, reserves, of, 4, 0, 10, 11, m, 3, 1, 4, 10, 13, cu, ft, it, is, the, major, norwegian, gas, field, it, is, connected, to, the, langeled, pipeline, currently, the, world, s, longest, underwater, pipeline, and, thus, to, a, major, european, gas, pipeline, network, several, other, gas, fields, are, being, developed, as, of, 2019, there, is, an, estimated, 6, 5, hm, 3, of, crude, oil, in, the, norwegian, sea, with, an, expectation, to, increase, oil, production, in, the, region, up, until, 2025, a, particular, challenge, is, the, kristin, field, where, the, temperature, is, as, high, as, 170, c, and, the, gas, pressure, exceeds, 900, bar, 900, times, the, normal, pressure, further, north, are, norne, and, sn, hvit, in, the, fishing, simulation, game, russian, fishing, 4, norwegian, sea, is, a, popular, map, especially, for, boat, fishing
