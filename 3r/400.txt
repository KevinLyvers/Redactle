vinson, massif, v, n, s, n, m, s, i, f, is, a, large, mountain, massif, in, antarctica, that, is, 21, km, 13, mi, long, and, 13, km, 8, mi, wide, and, lies, within, the, sentinel, range, of, the, ellsworth, mountains, it, overlooks, the, ronne, ice, shelf, near, the, base, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, massif, is, located, about, 1, 200, kilometres, 750, mi, from, the, south, pole, vinson, massif, was, discovered, in, january, 1958, by, u, s, navy, aircraft, in, 1961, the, vinson, massif, was, named, by, the, advisory, committee, on, antarctic, names, us, acan, after, carl, g, vinson, united, states, congressman, from, the, state, of, georgia, for, his, support, for, antarctic, exploration, on, november, 1, 2006, us, acan, declared, mount, vinson, and, vinson, massif, to, be, separate, entities, vinson, massif, lies, within, the, unrecognised, chilean, claim, under, the, antarctic, treaty, system, mount, vinson, is, the, highest, peak, in, antarctica, at, 4, 892, metres, 16, 050, ft, it, lies, in, the, north, part, of, vinson, massif, s, summit, plateau, in, the, south, portion, of, the, main, ridge, of, the, sentinel, range, about, 2, kilometres, 1, 1, 4, mi, north, of, hollister, peak, it, was, first, climbed, in, 1966, by, an, american, team, led, by, nicholas, clinch, an, expedition, in, 2001, was, the, first, to, climb, via, the, eastern, route, and, also, took, gps, measurements, of, the, height, of, the, peak, as, of, february, 2010, 1, 400, climbers, have, attempted, to, reach, the, summit, of, mount, vinson, mount, vinson, is, ranked, 6th, by, topographic, isolation, the, vinson, massif, extends, between, goodge, col, and, branscomb, glacier, to, the, northwest, nimitz, glacier, and, gildea, glacier, to, the, southwest, and, south, and, dater, glacier, and, its, tributary, hinkley, glacier, to, the, east, the, southeastern, part, of, the, massif, ends, at, hammer, col, which, joins, it, to, the, craddock, massif, of, which, the, highest, point, is, mount, rutford, 4, 477, metres, 14, 688, ft, the, massif, comprises, both, the, high, central, vinson, plateau, with, its, few, peaks, rising, to, over, 4, 700, metres, 15, 400, ft, and, several, side, ridges, mostly, trending, southwest, or, northeast, from, the, plateau, the, current, height, 4, 892, metres, 16, 050, ft, of, mount, vinson, was, measured, by, a, gps, survey, that, was, conducted, by, the, 2004, omega, foundation, team, comprising, damien, gildea, of, australia, leader, and, rodrigo, fica, and, camilo, rada, of, chile, since, 1998, and, continuing, through, 2007, the, omega, foundation, has, placed, a, gps, receiver, on, the, summit, for, a, suitable, period, of, time, to, obtain, accurate, satellite, readings, steeply, inclined, strata, known, as, the, crashsite, group, forms, vinson, massif, it, consists, of, 3, 000, meters, 9, 800, ft, of, shallow, water, mostly, marine, tan, green, and, red, quartzose, sandstones, quartzites, and, argillites, in, ascending, order, the, crashsite, group, is, subdivided, into, the, howard, nunataks, formation, 1, 630, meters, 5, 350, ft, the, mount, liptak, formation, 1, 070, meters, 3, 510, ft, and, the, mount, wyatt, earp, formation, 300, meters, 980, ft, erosion, resistant, and, steeply, inclined, beds, of, the, mount, wyatt, earp, formation, comprise, the, crest, of, the, vinson, massif, including, mount, vinson, the, steeply, inclined, strata, of, the, crashsite, group, are, part, of, the, western, limb, of, a, major, syncline, that, forms, the, core, of, the, sentinel, range, within, the, ellsworth, mountains, the, mount, wyatt, earp, formation, contains, devonian, fossils, the, transition, beds, at, the, base, of, the, crashsite, group, contain, late, cambrian, trilobites, the, intervening, lower, parts, of, the, crashsite, group, likely, include, ordovician, and, silurian, strata, the, climate, on, mount, vinson, is, generally, controlled, by, the, polar, ice, cap, s, high, pressure, system, creating, predominantly, stable, conditions, but, as, in, any, polar, climate, high, winds, and, snowfall, are, a, possibility, though, the, annual, snowfall, on, mount, vinson, is, low, high, winds, can, cause, base, camp, accumulations, up, to, 46, centimetres, 18, in, in, a, year, during, the, summer, season, november, through, january, there, are, 24, hours, of, sunlight, while, the, average, temperature, during, these, months, is, 30, c, 20, f, the, intense, sun, will, melt, snow, on, dark, objects, over, successive, years, the, limited, amount, of, snow, that, falls, on, vinson, massif, compacts, and, is, transformed, into, ice, forming, glaciers, these, glaciers, follow, the, topography, and, flow, down, the, mountain, s, valleys, the, uppermost, glacier, occupies, jacobsen, valley, on, the, north, face, of, mount, vinson, and, flows, either, into, branscomb, glacier, to, the, west, or, crosswell, glacier, to, the, east, the, crosswell, glacier, flows, into, the, rutford, ice, stream, via, ellen, glacier, the, south, face, of, mount, vinson, is, drained, by, roch, glacier, which, flows, westwards, into, branscomb, glacier, with, the, latter, leaving, vinson, massif, to, join, nimitz, glacier, a, high, mountain, provisionally, known, as, vinson, was, long, suspected, to, be, in, this, part, of, west, antarctica, but, it, was, not, actually, seen, until, january, 1958, when, it, was, spotted, by, us, navy, aircraft, from, byrd, station, it, was, named, after, carl, vinson, united, states, representative, from, georgia, who, was, a, key, supporter, of, funding, for, antarctic, research, the, first, measurement, of, the, vinson, massif, was, established, in, 1959, at, the, elevation, of, 5, 140, m, 16, 864, ft, in, 1963, two, groups, within, the, american, alpine, club, aac, one, led, by, charles, d, hollister, and, samuel, c, silverstein, m, d, then, in, new, york, and, the, other, led, by, peter, schoening, of, seattle, washington, began, lobbying, the, national, science, foundation, to, support, an, expedition, to, climb, mount, vinson, the, two, groups, merged, in, spring, 1966, at, the, urging, of, the, national, science, foundation, and, the, aac, and, nicholas, clinch, was, recruited, by, the, aac, to, lead, the, merged, expeditions, officially, named, the, american, antarctic, mountaineering, expedition, aame, 1966, 67, the, expedition, was, sponsored, by, the, aac, and, the, national, geographic, society, and, supported, in, the, field, by, the, u, s, navy, and, the, national, science, foundation, office, of, antarctic, programs, ten, scientists, and, mountaineers, participated, in, aame, 1966, 67, in, addition, to, clinch, they, were, barry, corbet, john, evans, university, of, minnesota, eiichi, fukushima, university, of, washington, seattle, charles, hollister, ph, d, columbia, university, william, long, alaska, methodist, university, brian, marts, peter, schoening, samuel, silverstein, rockefeller, university, and, richard, wahlstrom, in, the, months, prior, to, its, departure, for, antarctica, the, expedition, received, considerable, press, attention, primarily, because, of, the, reports, that, woodrow, wilson, sayre, was, planning, to, fly, in, a, piper, apache, piloted, by, max, conrad, the, flying, grandfather, with, four, companions, into, the, sentinel, range, to, climb, the, mount, vinson, sayre, had, a, reputation, for, problematic, trips, as, a, result, of, his, unauthorized, unsuccessful, and, nearly, fatal, attempt, to, climb, mount, everest, from, the, north, in, 1962, his, unauthorized, incursion, into, tibet, led, china, to, file, an, official, protest, with, the, u, s, state, department, in, the, end, the, purported, race, did, not, materialize, as, conrad, had, difficulties, with, his, plane, according, to, press, reports, he, and, sayre, were, still, in, buenos, aires, on, the, day, the, first, four, members, of, aame, 1966, 67, reached, mount, vinson, s, summit, in, december, 1966, the, navy, transported, the, expedition, and, its, supplies, from, christchurch, new, zealand, to, the, u, s, base, at, mcmurdo, sound, antarctica, and, from, there, in, a, ski, equipped, c, 130, hercules, to, the, sentinel, range, all, members, of, the, expedition, reached, the, summit, of, mount, vinson, the, first, group, of, four, climbers, summited, on, december, 18, 1966, four, more, on, december, 19, and, the, last, three, on, december, 20, on, august, 17, 2006, from, nomination, by, damien, gildea, of, the, omega, foundation, us, acan, approved, naming, the, subsidiary, peaks, south, of, mount, vinson, for, the, aame, 1966, 67, members, nicholas, clinch, barry, corbet, eiichi, fukushima, charles, hollister, brian, marts, samuel, silverstein, peter, schoening, and, richard, wahlstrom, other, peaks, in, the, sentinel, range, had, previously, been, named, for, john, evans, and, william, long, the, climb, of, vinson, offers, little, technical, difficulty, beyond, the, usual, hazards, of, travel, in, antarctica, and, as, one, of, the, seven, summits, it, has, received, much, attention, from, well, funded, climbers, in, recent, years, multiple, guide, companies, offer, guided, expeditions, to, mount, vinson, at, a, typical, cost, of, around, us, 45, 000, per, person, including, transportation, to, antarctica, from, chile, the, skyrunner, fernanda, maciel, did, the, fastest, ascent, of, vinson, in, 6h40min, and, round, trip, in, 9h41min, from, base, camp, while, the, vast, majority, of, prior, climbs, to, the, summit, have, used, the, western, side, of, the, massif, from, the, branscomb, glacier, the, first, ascent, from, the, east, side, was, successfully, completed, by, an, eight, person, team, sponsored, by, nova, in, january, 2001, the, team, consisted, of, the, team, not, only, made, the, first, ascent, from, the, east, side, but, also, performed, scientific, research, into, snow, accumulation, at, different, elevations, as, well, as, taking, the, first, ground, based, gps, reading, from, the, summit, the, gps, reading, gave, the, elevation, of, the, highest, point, in, antarctica, as, 4, 900, m, 16, 077, ft, eclipsing, the, earlier, established, heights, recorded, in, 1959, and, 1979, another, first, was, the, successful, aircraft, landing, of, a, twin, otter, on, the, upper, dater, glacier, on, the, eastern, slopes, of, mount, vinson, nova, named, the, production, mountain, of, ice, which, first, aired, on, pbs, in, february, 2003, https, alpinemag, fr,
