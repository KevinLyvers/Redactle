the, majority, of, contemporary, territory, of, turkey, geographically, anatolia, is, bounded, by, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, south, the, aegean, sea, to, the, west, the, turkish, straits, to, the, northwest, and, the, black, sea, to, the, north, the, eastern, and, southeastern, limits, has, either, been, expanded, to, the, entirety, of, asiatic, turkey, or, to, an, imprecise, line, from, the, black, sea, to, gulf, of, iskenderun, topographically, the, sea, of, marmara, connects, the, black, sea, with, the, aegean, sea, through, the, bosporus, strait, and, the, dardanelles, strait, and, separates, anatolia, from, thrace, in, the, balkan, peninsula, of, southeastern, europe, anatolia, was, an, early, centre, for, the, development, of, farming, during, the, neolithic, period, following, its, origination, in, the, adjacent, fertile, crescent, beginning, around, 9, 000, years, ago, there, was, major, migration, of, anatolian, neolithic, farmers, into, europe, with, their, descendants, coming, to, dominate, europe, as, far, west, as, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, british, isles, the, ancient, anatolian, peoples, spoke, the, now, extinct, anatolian, languages, of, the, indo, european, language, family, which, were, largely, replaced, by, the, greek, language, during, classical, antiquity, as, well, as, during, the, hellenistic, roman, and, byzantine, periods, the, major, anatolian, languages, included, hittite, luwian, and, lydian, while, other, poorly, attested, local, languages, included, phrygian, and, mysian, hurro, urartian, languages, were, spoken, in, the, southeastern, kingdom, of, mitanni, while, galatian, a, celtic, language, was, spoken, in, galatia, central, anatolia, ancient, peoples, in, the, region, included, galatians, hurrians, assyrians, armenians, hattians, cimmerians, as, well, as, ionian, dorian, and, aeolic, greeks, the, turkification, of, anatolia, began, under, the, rule, of, the, seljuk, empire, in, the, late, 11th, century, continued, under, the, ottoman, empire, between, the, late, 13th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, continues, today, under, the, republic, of, t, rkiye, however, various, non, turkic, languages, continue, to, be, spoken, by, minorities, in, anatolia, including, kurdish, neo, aramaic, armenian, north, caucasian, languages, laz, georgian, and, greek, traditionally, anatolia, is, considered, to, extend, in, the, east, to, an, indefinite, line, running, from, the, gulf, of, alexandretta, to, the, black, sea, coterminous, with, the, anatolian, plateau, this, traditional, geographical, definition, is, used, for, example, in, the, latest, edition, of, merriam, webster, s, geographical, dictionary, under, this, definition, anatolia, is, bounded, to, the, east, by, the, armenian, highlands, and, the, euphrates, before, that, river, bends, to, the, southeast, to, enter, mesopotamia, to, the, southeast, it, is, bounded, by, the, ranges, that, separate, it, from, the, orontes, valley, in, syria, and, the, mesopotamian, plain, following, the, armenian, genocide, western, armenia, was, renamed, the, eastern, anatolia, region, by, the, newly, established, turkish, government, in, 1941, with, the, first, geography, congress, which, divided, turkey, into, seven, geographical, regions, based, on, differences, in, climate, and, landscape, the, eastern, provinces, of, turkey, were, placed, into, the, eastern, anatolia, region, which, largely, corresponds, to, the, historical, region, of, western, armenia, named, as, such, after, the, division, of, greater, armenia, between, the, roman, byzantine, empire, western, armenia, and, sassanid, persia, eastern, armenia, in, 387, ad, vazken, davidian, terms, the, expanded, use, of, anatolia, to, apply, to, territory, in, eastern, turkey, that, was, formerly, referred, to, as, armenia, which, had, a, sizeable, armenian, population, before, the, armenian, genocide, an, ahistorical, imposition, and, notes, that, a, growing, body, of, literature, is, uncomfortable, with, referring, to, the, ottoman, east, as, eastern, anatolia, the, highest, mountain, in, the, eastern, anatolia, region, also, the, highest, peak, in, the, armenian, highlands, is, mount, ararat, 5123, m, the, euphrates, aras, karasu, and, murat, rivers, connect, the, armenian, highlands, to, the, south, caucasus, and, the, upper, euphrates, valley, along, with, the, oruh, these, rivers, are, the, longest, in, the, eastern, anatolia, region, the, english, language, name, anatolia, derives, from, the, greek, anatol, meaning, the, east, and, designating, from, a, greek, point, of, view, eastern, regions, in, general, the, greek, word, refers, to, the, direction, where, the, sun, rises, coming, from, anatello, rise, up, comparable, to, terms, in, other, languages, such, as, levant, from, latin, levo, to, rise, orient, from, latin, orior, to, arise, to, originate, hebrew, mizra, east, from, zara, to, rise, to, shine, aramaic, midna, from, dena, to, rise, to, shine, the, use, of, anatolian, designations, has, varied, over, time, perhaps, originally, referring, to, the, aeolian, ionian, and, dorian, colonies, situated, along, the, eastern, coasts, of, the, aegean, sea, but, also, encompassing, eastern, regions, in, general, such, use, of, anatolian, designations, was, employed, during, the, reign, of, roman, emperor, diocletian, r, 284, 305, who, created, the, diocese, of, the, east, known, in, greek, as, the, eastern, diocese, but, completely, unrelated, to, the, regions, of, asia, minor, in, their, widest, territorial, scope, anatolian, designations, were, employed, during, the, reign, of, roman, emperor, constantine, i, 306, 337, who, created, the, praetorian, prefecture, of, the, east, known, in, greek, as, the, eastern, prefecture, encompassing, all, eastern, regions, of, the, late, roman, empire, and, spanning, from, thrace, to, egypt, only, after, the, loss, of, other, eastern, regions, during, the, 7th, century, and, the, reduction, of, byzantine, eastern, domains, to, asia, minor, that, region, became, the, only, remaining, part, of, the, byzantine, east, and, thus, commonly, referred, to, in, greek, as, the, eastern, part, of, the, empire, at, the, same, time, the, anatolic, theme, the, eastern, theme, was, created, as, a, province, theme, covering, the, western, and, central, parts, of, turkey, s, present, day, central, anatolia, region, centered, around, iconium, but, ruled, from, the, city, of, amorium, the, latinized, form, anatolia, with, its, ia, ending, is, probably, a, medieval, latin, innovation, the, modern, turkish, form, anadolu, derives, directly, from, the, greek, name, a, anatol, the, russian, male, name, anatoly, the, french, anatole, and, plain, anatol, all, stemming, from, saints, anatolius, of, laodicea, d, 283, and, anatolius, of, constantinople, d, 458, the, first, patriarch, of, constantinople, share, the, same, linguistic, origin, the, oldest, known, name, for, any, region, within, anatolia, is, related, to, its, central, area, known, as, the, land, of, hatti, a, designation, that, was, initially, used, for, the, land, of, ancient, hattians, but, later, became, the, most, common, name, for, the, entire, territory, under, the, rule, of, ancient, hittites, the, first, recorded, name, the, greeks, used, for, the, anatolian, peninsula, though, not, particularly, popular, at, the, time, was, as, a, perhaps, from, an, akkadian, expression, for, the, sunrise, or, possibly, echoing, the, name, of, the, assuwa, league, in, western, anatolia, the, romans, used, it, as, the, name, of, their, province, comprising, the, west, of, the, peninsula, plus, the, nearby, aegean, islands, as, the, name, asia, broadened, its, scope, to, apply, to, the, vaster, region, east, of, the, mediterranean, some, greeks, in, late, antiquity, came, to, use, the, name, asia, minor, mikr, as, a, meaning, lesser, asia, to, refer, to, present, day, anatolia, whereas, the, administration, of, the, empire, preferred, the, description, anatol, lit, the, east, the, endonym, r, man, a, the, land, of, the, romans, i, e, the, eastern, roman, empire, was, understood, as, another, name, for, the, province, by, the, invading, seljuq, turks, who, founded, a, sultanate, of, r, m, in, 1077, thus, land, of, the, r, m, became, another, name, for, anatolia, by, the, 12th, century, europeans, had, started, referring, to, anatolia, as, turchia, during, the, era, of, the, ottoman, empire, many, mapmakers, referred, to, the, mountainous, plateau, in, eastern, anatolia, as, armenia, other, contemporary, sources, called, the, same, area, kurdistan, geographers, have, used, east, anatolian, plateau, armenian, plateau, and, the, iranian, plateau, to, refer, to, the, region, the, former, two, largely, overlap, while, a, standard, definition, of, anatolia, refers, to, the, entire, asian, side, of, turkey, according, to, archaeologist, lori, khatchadourian, this, difference, in, terminology, primarily, result, from, the, shifting, political, fortunes, and, cultural, trajectories, of, the, region, since, the, nineteenth, century, turkey, s, first, geography, congress, in, 1941, created, two, geographical, regions, of, turkey, to, the, east, of, the, gulf, of, iskenderun, black, sea, line, the, eastern, anatolia, region, and, the, southeastern, anatolia, region, the, former, largely, corresponding, to, the, western, part, of, the, armenian, highlands, the, latter, to, the, northern, part, of, the, mesopotamian, plain, according, to, richard, hovannisian, this, changing, of, toponyms, was, necessary, to, obscure, all, evidence, of, the, armenian, presence, as, part, of, the, policy, of, armenian, genocide, denial, embarked, upon, by, the, newly, established, turkish, government, and, what, hovannisian, calls, its, foreign, collaborators, human, habitation, in, anatolia, dates, back, to, the, paleolithic,

considered, the, most, advanced, of, these, recent, advances, in, archaeogenetics, have, confirmed, that, the, spread, of, agriculture, from, the, middle, east, to, europe, was, strongly, correlated, with, the, migration, of, early, farmers, from, anatolia, about, 9, 000, years, ago, and, was, not, just, a, cultural, exchange, anatolian, neolithic, farmers, derived, most, of, their, ancestry, from, local, anatolian, hunter, gatherers, suggesting, that, agriculture, was, adopted, in, site, by, these, hunter, gatherers, and, not, spread, by, demic, diffusion, into, the, region, anatolian, derived, neolithic, farmers, would, subsequently, spread, across, europe, as, far, west, as, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, british, isles, as, well, as, to, the, maghreb, most, modern, europeans, derive, a, significant, part, of, their, ancestry, from, these, neolithic, anatolian, farmers, neolithic, anatolia, has, been, proposed, as, the, homeland, of, the, indo, european, language, family, although, linguists, tend, to, favour, a, later, origin, in, the, steppes, north, of, the, black, sea, however, it, is, clear, that, the, anatolian, languages, the, earliest, attested, branch, of, indo, european, have, been, spoken, in, anatolia, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, bce, the, earliest, historical, data, related, to, anatolia, appear, during, the, bronze, age, and, continue, throughout, the, iron, age, the, most, ancient, period, in, the, history, of, anatolia, spans, from, the, emergence, of, ancient, hattians, up, to, the, conquest, of, anatolia, by, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, 6th, century, bce, the, earliest, historically, attested, populations, of, anatolia, were, the, hattians, in, central, anatolia, and, hurrians, further, to, the, east, the, hattians, were, an, indigenous, people, whose, main, center, was, the, city, of, hattush, affiliation, of, hattian, language, remains, unclear, while, hurrian, language, belongs, to, a, distinctive, family, of, hurro, urartian, languages, all, of, those, languages, are, extinct, relationships, with, indigenous, languages, of, the, caucasus, have, been, proposed, but, are, not, generally, accepted, the, region, became, famous, for, exporting, raw, materials, organized, trade, between, anatolia, and, mesopotamia, started, to, emerge, during, the, period, of, the, akkadian, empire, and, was, continued, and, intensified, during, the, period, of, the, old, assyrian, empire, between, the, 21st, and, the, 18th, centuries, bce, assyrian, traders, were, bringing, tin, and, textiles, in, exchange, for, copper, silver, or, gold, cuneiform, records, dated, c, 20th, century, bce, found, in, anatolia, at, the, assyrian, colony, of, kanesh, use, an, advanced, system, of, trading, computations, and, credit, lines, unlike, the, akkadians, and, assyrians, whose, anatolian, trading, posts, were, peripheral, to, their, core, lands, in, mesopotamia, the, hittites, were, centered, at, hattusa, modern, bo, azkale, in, north, central, anatolia, by, the, 17th, century, bce, they, were, speakers, of, an, indo, european, language, the, hittite, language, or, nesili, the, language, of, nesa, in, hittite, the, hittites, originated, from, local, ancient, cultures, that, grew, in, anatolia, in, addition, to, the, arrival, of, indo, european, languages, attested, for, the, first, time, in, the, assyrian, tablets, of, nesa, around, 2000, bce, they, conquered, hattusa, in, the, 18th, century, bce, imposing, themselves, over, hattian, and, hurrian, speaking, populations, according, to, the, widely, accepted, kurgan, theory, on, the, proto, indo, european, homeland, however, the, hittites, along, with, the, other, indo, european, ancient, anatolians, were, themselves, relatively, recent, immigrants, to, anatolia, from, the, north, however, they, did, not, necessarily, displace, the, population, genetically, they, assimilated, into, the, former, peoples, culture, preserving, the, hittite, language, the, hittites, adopted, the, mesopotamian, cuneiform, script, in, the, late, bronze, age, hittite, new, kingdom, c, 1650, bce, was, founded, becoming, an, empire, in, the, 14th, century, bce, after, the, conquest, of, kizzuwatna, in, the, south, east, and, the, defeat, of, the, assuwa, league, in, western, anatolia, the, empire, reached, its, height, in, the, 13th, century, bce, controlling, much, of, asia, minor, northwestern, syria, and, northwest, upper, mesopotamia, however, the, hittite, advance, toward, the, black, sea, coast, was, halted, by, the, semi, nomadic, pastoralist, and, tribal, kaskians, a, non, indo, european, people, who, had, earlier, displaced, the, palaic, speaking, indo, europeans, much, of, the, history, of, the, hittite, empire, concerned, war, with, the, rival, empires, of, egypt, assyria, and, the, mitanni, the, ancient, egyptians, eventually, withdrew, from, the, region, after, failing, to, gain, the, upper, hand, over, the, hittites, and, becoming, wary, of, the, power, of, assyria, which, had, destroyed, the, mitanni, empire, the, assyrians, and, hittites, were, then, left, to, battle, over, control, of, eastern, and, southern, anatolia, and, colonial, territories, in, syria, the, assyrians, had, better, success, than, the, egyptians, annexing, much, hittite, and, hurrian, territory, in, these, regions, after, 1180, bce, during, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, hittite, empire, disintegrated, into, several, independent, syro, hittite, states, subsequent, to, losing, much, territory, to, the, middle, assyrian, empire, and, being, finally, overrun, by, the, phrygians, another, indo, european, people, who, are, believed, to, have, migrated, from, the, balkans, the, phrygian, expansion, into, southeast, anatolia, was, eventually, halted, by, the, assyrians, who, controlled, that, region, another, indo, european, people, the, luwians, rose, to, prominence, in, central, and, western, anatolia, c, 2000, bce, their, language, belonged, to, the, same, linguistic, branch, as, hittite, the, general, consensus, amongst, scholars, is, that, luwian, was, spoken, across, a, large, area, of, western, anatolia, including, possibly, wilusa, troy, the, seha, river, land, to, be, identified, with, the, hermos, and, or, kaikos, valley, and, the, kingdom, of, mira, kuwaliya, with, its, core, territory, of, the, maeander, valley, from, the, 9th, century, bce, luwian, regions, coalesced, into, a, number, of, states, such, as, lydia, caria, and, lycia, all, of, which, had, hellenic, influence, arameans, encroached, over, the, borders, of, south, central, anatolia, in, the, century, or, so, after, the, fall, of, the, hittite, empire, and, some, of, the, syro, hittite, states, in, this, region, became, an, amalgam, of, hittites, and, arameans, these, became, known, as, syro, hittite, states, from, the, 10th, to, late, 7th, centuries, bce, much, of, anatolia, particularly, the,

assyrian, city, to, fall, was, harran, in, southeast, anatolia, this, city, was, the, birthplace, of, the, last, king, of, babylon, the, assyrian, nabonidus, and, his, son, and, regent, belshazzar, much, of, the, region, then, fell, to, the, short, lived, iran, based, median, empire, with, the, babylonians, and, scythians, briefly, appropriating, some, territory, from, the, late, 8th, century, bce, a, new, wave, of, indo, european, speaking, raiders, entered, northern, and, northeast, anatolia, the, cimmerians, and, scythians, the, cimmerians, overran, phrygia, and, the, scythians,

continue, to, debate, the, cause, of, the, urban, decline, in, byzantine, anatolia, between, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, variously, attributing, it, to, the, plague, of, justinian, 541, the,
