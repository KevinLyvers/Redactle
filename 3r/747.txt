meanwhile, the, majority, in, southern, ireland, which, became, the, irish, free, state, in, 1922, and, a, significant, minority, in, northern, ireland, were, irish, nationalists, generally, catholics, who, wanted, a, united, independent, ireland, today, the, former, generally, see, themselves, as, british, and, the, latter, generally, see, themselves, as, irish, while, a, northern, irish, or, ulster, identity, is, claimed, by, a, significant, minority, from, all, backgrounds, the, creation, of, northern, ireland, was, accompanied, by, violence, both, in, defence, of, and, against, partition, during, the, conflict, of, 1920, 22, the, capital, belfast, saw, major, communal, violence, mainly, between, protestant, unionist, and, catholic, nationalist, civilians, more,

the, late, 1960s, a, campaign, to, end, discrimination, against, catholics, and, nationalists, was, opposed, by, loyalists, who, saw, it, as, a, republican, front, this, unrest, sparked, the, troubles, a, thirty, year, conflict, involving, republican, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, and, state, forces, which, claimed, over, 3, 500, lives, and, injured, 50, 000, others, the, 1998, good, friday, agreement, was, a, major, step, in, the, peace, process, including, paramilitary, disarmament, and, security, normalisation, although, sectarianism, and, segregation, remain, major, social, problems, and, sporadic, violence, has, continued, the, economy, of, northern, ireland, was, the, most, industrialised, in, ireland, at, the, time, of, partition, but, soon, began, to, decline, exacerbated, by, the, political, and, social, turmoil, of, the, troubles, its, economy, has, grown, significantly, since, the, late, 1990s, unemployment, in, northern, ireland, peaked, at, 17, 2, in, 1986, but, dropped, back, down, to, below, 10, in, the, 2010s, similar, to, the, rate, of, the, rest, of, the, uk, cultural, links, between, northern, ireland, the, rest, of, ireland, and, the, rest, of, the, uk, are, complex, with, northern, ireland, sharing, both, the, culture, of, ireland, and, the, culture, of, the, united, kingdom, in, many, sports, there, is, an, all, ireland, governing, body, or, team, for, the, whole, island, the, most, notable, exception, is, association, football, northern, ireland, competes, separately, at, the, commonwealth, games, and, people, from, northern, ireland, may, compete, for, either, great, britain, or, ireland, at, the, olympic, games, the, region, that, is, now, northern, ireland, was, long, inhabited, by, native, gaels, who, were, irish, speaking, and, predominantly, catholic, it, was, made, up, of, several, gaelic, kingdoms, and, territories, and, was, part, of, the, province, of, ulster, in, 1169, ireland, was, invaded, by, a, coalition, of, forces, under, the, command, of, the, english, crown, that, quickly, overran, and, occupied, most, of, the, island, beginning, 800, years, of, foreign, central, authority, attempts, at, resistance, were, swiftly, crushed, everywhere, outside, of, ulster, unlike, in, the, rest, of, the, country, where, gaelic, authority, continued, only, in, scattered, remote, pockets, the, major, kingdoms, of, ulster, would, mostly, remain, intact, with, english, authority, in, the, province, contained, to, areas, on, the, eastern, coast, closest, to, great, britain, english, power, gradually, eroded, in, the, face, of, stubborn, irish, resistance, in, the, centuries, that, followed, eventually, being, reduced, to, only, the, city, of, dublin, and, its, suburbs, when, henry, viii, launched, the, 16th, century, tudor, re, conquest, of, ireland, ulster, once, again, resisted, most, effectively, in, the, nine, years, war, 1594, 1603, an, alliance, of, gaelic, chieftains, led, by, the, two, most, powerful, ulster, lords, hugh, roe, o, donnell, and, the, earl, of, tyrone, fought, against, the, english, government, in, ireland, the, ulster, dominated, alliance, represented, the, first, irish, united, front, prior, resistance, had, always, been, geographically, localized, despite, being, able, to, cement, an, alliance, with, spain, and, major, victories, early, on, defeat, was, virtually, inevitable, following, england, s, victory, at, the, siege, of, kinsale, in, 1607, the, rebellion, s, leaders, fled, to, mainland, europe, alongside, much, of, ulster, s, gaelic, nobility, their, lands, were, confiscated, by, the, crown, and, colonized, with, english, speaking, protestant, settlers, from, britain, in, the, plantation, of, ulster, this, led, to, the, founding, of, many, of, ulster, s, towns, and, created, a, lasting, ulster, protestant, community, with, ties, to, britain, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1641, began, in, ulster, the, rebels, wanted, an, end, to, anti, catholic, discrimination, greater, irish, self, governance, and, to, roll, back, the, plantation, it, developed, into, an, ethnic, conflict, between, irish, catholics, and, british, protestant, settlers, and, became, part, of, the, wider, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, 1639, 53, which, ended, with, the, english, parliamentarian, conquest, further, protestant, victories, in, the, williamite, jacobite, war, 1688, 91, solidified, anglican, protestant, rule, in, the, kingdom, of, ireland, the, williamite, victories, of, the, siege, of, derry, 1689, and, battle, of, the, boyne, 1690, are, still, celebrated, by, some, protestants, in, northern, ireland, many, more, scots, protestants, migrated, to, ulster, during, the, scottish, famine, of, the, 1690s, following, the, williamite, victory, and, contrary, to, the, treaty, of, limerick, 1691, a, series, of, penal, laws, were, passed, by, the, anglican, protestant, ruling, class, in, ireland, the, intention, was, to, disadvantage, catholics, and, to, a, lesser, extent, presbyterians, some, 250, 000, ulster, presbyterians, emigrated, to, the, british, north, american, colonies, between, 1717, and, 1775, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, more, than, 27, million, scotch, irish, americans, now, living, in, the, united, states, along, with, many, scotch, irish, canadians, in, canada, in, the, context, of, institutional, discrimination, the, 18th, century, saw, secret, militant, societies, develop, in, ulster, and, act, on, sectarian, tensions, in, violent, attacks, this, escalated, at, the, end, of, the, century, especially, during, the, county, armagh, disturbances, where, the, protestant, peep, o, day, boys, fought, the, catholic, defenders, this, led, to, the, founding, of, the, protestant, orange, order, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1798, was, led, by, the, united, irishmen, a, cross, community, irish, republican, group, founded, by, belfast, presbyterians, which, sought, irish, independence, following, this, the, government, of, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, pushed, for, the, two, kingdoms, to, be, merged, in, an, attempt, to, quell, violent, sectarianism, remove, discriminatory, laws, and, prevent, the, spread, of, french, style, republicanism, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, was, formed, in, 1801, and, governed, from, london, during, the, 19th, century, legal, reforms, known, as, the, catholic, emancipation, continued, to, remove, discrimination, against, catholics, and, progressive, programs, enabled, tenant, farmers, to, buy, land, from, landlords, by, the, late, 19th, century, a, large, and, disciplined, cohort, of, irish, nationalist, mps, at, westminster, committed, the, liberal, party, to, irish, home, rule, self, government, for, ireland, within, the, united, kingdom, this, was, bitterly, opposed, by, irish, unionists, most, of, whom, were, protestants, who, feared, an, irish, devolved, government, dominated, by, irish, nationalists, and, catholics, the, government, of, ireland, bill, 1886, and, government, of, ireland, bill, 1893, were, defeated, however, home, rule, became, a, near, certainty, in, 1912, after, the, government, of, ireland, act, 1914, was, first, introduced, the, liberal, government, was, dependent, on, nationalist, support, and, the, parliament, act, 1911, prevented, the, house, of, lords, from, blocking, the, bill, indefinitely, in, response, unionists, vowed, to, prevent, irish, home, rule, from, conservative, and, unionist, party, leaders, such, as, bonar, law, and, dublin, based, barrister, edward, carson, to, militant, working, class, unionists, in, ireland, this, sparked, the, home, rule, crisis, in, september, 1912, more, than, 500, 000, unionists, signed, the, ulster, covenant, pledging, to, oppose, home, rule, by, any, means, and, to, defy, any, irish, government, in, 1914, unionists, smuggled, thousands, of, rifles, and, rounds, of, ammunition, from, imperial, germany, for, use, by, the, ulster, volunteers, uvf, a, paramilitary, organisation, formed, to, oppose, home, rule, irish, nationalists, had, also, formed, a, paramilitary, organisation, the, irish, volunteers, it, sought, to, ensure, home, rule, was, implemented, and, it, smuggled, its, own, weapons, into, ireland, a, few, months, after, the, ulster, volunteers, ireland, seemed, to, be, on, the, brink, of, civil, war, unionists, were, in, a, minority, in, ireland, as, a, whole, but, a, majority, in, the, province, of, ulster, especially, the, counties, antrim, down, armagh, and, londonderry, unionists, argued, that, if, home, rule, could, not, be, stopped, then, all, or, part, of, ulster, should, be, excluded, from, it, in, may, 1914, the, uk, government, introduced, an, amending, bill, to, allow, for, ulster, to, be, excluded, from, home, rule, there, was, then, debate, over, how, much, of, ulster, should, be, excluded, and, for, how, long, some, ulster, unionists, were, willing, to, tolerate, the, loss, of, some, mainly, catholic, areas, of, the, province, the, crisis, was, interrupted, by, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, august, 1914, and, ireland, s, involvement, in, it, the, uk, government, abandoned, the, amending, bill, and, instead, rushed, through, a, new, bill, the, suspensory, act, 1914, suspending, home, rule, for, the, duration, of, the, war, with, the, exclusion, of, ulster, still, to, be, decided, by, the, end, of, the, war, during, which, the, 1916, easter, rising, had, taken, place, most, irish, nationalists, now, wanted, full, independence, rather, than, home, rule, in, september, 1919, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, tasked, a, committee, with, planning, another, home, rule, bill, headed, by, english, unionist, politician, walter, long, it, was, known, as, the, long, committee, it, decided, that, two, devolved, governments, should, be, established, one, for, the, nine, counties, of, ulster, and, one, for, the, rest, of, ireland, together, with, a, council, of, ireland, for, the, encouragement, of, irish, unity, most, ulster, unionists, wanted, the, territory, of, the, ulster, government, to, be, reduced, to, six, counties, so, that, it, would, have, a, larger, protestant, unionist, majority, which, they, believed, would, guarantee, its, longevity, the, six, counties, of, antrim, down, armagh, londonderry, tyrone, and, fermanagh, comprised, the, maximum, area, unionists, believed, they, could, dominate, the, area, that, was, to, become, northern, ireland, included, counties, fermanagh, and, tyrone, even, though, they, had, nationalist, majorities, in, the, 1918, irish, general, election, events, overtook, the, government, in, the, 1918, irish, general, election, the, pro, independence, sinn, f, in, party, won, the, overwhelming, majority, of, irish, seats, sinn, f, in, s, elected, members, boycotted, the, british, parliament, and, founded, a, separate, irish, parliament, d, il, ireann, declaring, an, independent, irish, republic, covering, the, whole, island, many, irish, republicans, blamed, the, british, establishment, for, the, sectarian, divisions, in, ireland, and, believed, that, ulster, unionism, would, fade, once, british, rule, was, ended, the, british, authorities, outlawed, the, d, il, in, september, 1919, and, a, guerrilla, conflict, developed, as, the, irish, republican, army, ira, began, attacking, british, forces, this, became, known, as, the, irish, war, of, independence, meanwhile, the, government, of, ireland, act, 1920, passed, through, the, british, parliament, in, 1920, it, would, divide, ireland, into, two, self, governing, uk, territories, the, six, northeastern, counties, northern, ireland, being, ruled, from, belfast, and, the, other, twenty, six, counties, southern, ireland, being, ruled, from, dublin, both, would, have, a, shared, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, who, would, appoint, both, governments, and, a, council, of, ireland, which, the, uk, government, intended, to, evolve, into, an, all, ireland, parliament, the, act, received, royal, assent, that, december, becoming, the, government, of, ireland, act, 1920, it, came, into, force, on, 3, may, 1921, partitioning, ireland, and, creating, northern, ireland, the, 1921, irish, elections, were, held, on, 24, may, in, which, unionists, won, most, seats, in, the, northern, ireland, parliament, it, first, met, on, 7, june, and, formed, its, first, devolved, government, headed, by, ulster, unionist, party, leader, james, craig, irish, nationalist, members, refused, to, attend, king, george, v, addressed, the, ceremonial, opening, of, the, northern, parliament, on, 22, june, during, 1920, 22, in, what, became, northern, ireland, partition, was, accompanied, by, violence, in, defence, or, opposition, to, the, new, settlement, during, the, troubles, 1920, 1922, the, ira, carried, out, attacks, on, british, forces, in, the, north, east, but, was, less, active, than, in, the, rest, of, ireland, protestant, loyalists, attacked, catholics, in, reprisal, for, ira, actions, in, the, summer, of, 1920, sectarian, violence, erupted, in, belfast, and, derry, and, there, were, mass, burnings, of, catholic, property, in, lisburn, and, banbridge, conflict, continued, intermittently, for, two, years, mostly, in, belfast, which, saw, savage, and, unprecedented, communal, violence, between, protestants, and, catholics, including, rioting, gun, battles, and, bombings, homes, businesses, and, churches, were, attacked, and, people, were, expelled, from, workplaces, and, mixed, neighbourhoods, more, than, 500, were, killed, and, more, than, 10, 000, became, refugees, most, of, them, catholics, the, british, army, was, deployed, and, the, ulster, special, constabulary, usc, was, formed, to, help, the, regular, police, the, usc, was, almost, wholly, protestant, members, of, the, usc, and, regular, police, were, involved, in, reprisal, attacks, on, catholic, civilians, a, truce, between, british, forces, and, the, ira, was, established, on, 11, july, 1921, ending, the, fighting, in, most, of, ireland, however, communal, violence, continued, in, belfast, and, in, 1922, the, ira, launched, a, guerrilla, offensive, along, the, new, irish, border, the, anglo, irish, treaty, was, signed, between, representatives, of, the, governments, of, the, uk, and, the, irish, republic, on, 6, december, 1921, laying, out, the, process, for, the, creation, of, the, irish, free, state, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, northern, ireland, would, become, part, of, the, free, state, unless, its, government, opted, out, by, presenting, an, address, to, the, king, although, in, practice, partition, remained, in, place, the, irish, free, state, came, into, existence, on, 6, december, 1922, and, on, the, following, day, the, parliament, of, northern, ireland, resolved, to, exercise, its, right, to, opt, out, of, the, free, state, by, making, an, address, to, king, george, v, the, text, of, the, address, was, most, gracious, sovereign, we, your, majesty, s, most, dutiful, and, loyal, subjects, the, senators, and, commons, of, northern, ireland, in, parliament, assembled, having, learnt, of, the, passing, of, the, irish, free, state, constitution, act, 1922, being, the, act, of, parliament, for, the, ratification, of, the, articles, of, agreement, for, a, treaty, between, great, britain, and, ireland, do, by, this, humble, address, pray, your, majesty, that, the, powers, of, the, parliament, and, government, of, the, irish, free, state, shall, no, longer, extend, to, northern, ireland, shortly, afterwards, the, irish, boundary, commission, was, established, to, decide, on, the, border, between, the, irish, free, state, and, northern, ireland, owing, to, the, outbreak, of, the, irish, civil, war, the, work, of, the, commission, was, delayed, until, 1925, the, free, state, government, and, irish, nationalists, hoped, for, a, large, transfer, of, territory, to, the, free, state, as, many, border, areas, had, nationalist, majorities, many, believed, this, would, leave, the, remaining, northern, ireland, territory, too, small, to, be, viable, however, the, commission, s, final, report, recommended, only, small, transfers, of, territory, and, in, both, directions, the, free, state, northern, ireland, and, uk, governments, agreed, to, suppress, the, report, and, accept, the, status, quo, while, the, uk, government, agreed, that, the, free, state, would, no, longer, have, to, pay, a, share, of, the, uk, national, debt, northern, ireland, s, border, was, drawn, to, give, it, a, decisive, protestant, majority, at, the, time, of, its, creation, northern, ireland, s, population, was, two, thirds, protestant, and, one, third, catholic, most, protestants, were, unionists, loyalists, who, sought, to, maintain, northern, ireland, as, a, part, of, the, united, kingdom, while, most, catholics, were, irish, nationalists, republicans, who, sought, an, independent, united, ireland, there, was, mutual, self, imposed, segregation, in, northern, ireland, between, protestants, and, catholics, such, as, in, education, housing, and, often, employment, for, its, first, fifty, years, northern, ireland, had, an, unbroken, series, of, ulster, unionist, party, governments, every, prime, minister, and, almost, every, minister, of, these, governments, were, members, of, the, orange, order, as, were, all, but, 11, of, the, 149, ulster, unionist, party, uup, mps, elected, during, this, time, almost, all, judges, and, magistrates, were, protestant, many, of, them, closely, associated, with, the, uup, northern, ireland, s, new, police, force, was, the, royal, ulster, constabulary, ruc, which, succeeded, the, royal, irish, constabulary, ric, it, too, was, almost, wholly, protestant, and, lacked, operational, independence, responding, to, directions, from, government, ministers, the, ruc, and, the, reserve, ulster, special, constabulary, usc, were, militarized, police, forces, due, to, the, perceived, threat, of, militant, republicanism, in, 1936, the, british, advocacy, group, the, national, council, for, civil, liberties, characterised, the, usc, as, nothing, but, the, organised, army, of, the, unionist, party, they, had, at, their, disposal, the, special, powers, act, a, sweeping, piece, of, legislation, which, allowed, arrests, without, warrant, internment, without, trial, unlimited, search, powers, and, bans, on, meetings, and, publications, this, 1922, act, was, made, permanent, in, 1933, and, was, not, repealed, until, 1973, the, nationalist, party, was, the, main, political, party, in, opposition, to, the, uup, governments, however, its, elected, members, often, protested, by, abstaining, from, the, northern, ireland, parliament, and, many, nationalists, did, not, vote, in, parliamentary, elections, other, early, nationalist, groups, which, campaigned, against, partition, included, the, national, league, of, the, north, formed, in, 1928, the, northern, council, for, unity, formed, in, 1937, and, the, irish, anti, partition, league, formed, in, 1945, the, local, government, act, northern, ireland, of, 1922, allowed, for, the, altering, of, municipal, and, rural, boundaries, this, act, led, to, the, gerrymandering, of, local, election, boundaries, in, the, nationalists, majority, cities, of, derry, city, enniskillen, omagh, armagh, and, many, other, towns, and, rural, districts, that, action, ensured, unionist, control, over, local, councils, in, areas, where, they, were, a, minority, the, uup, governments, and, some, uup, dominated, local, authorities, discriminated, against, the, catholic, and, irish, nationalist, minority, especially, by, the, gerrymandering, of, local, electoral, boundaries, the, allocation, of, public, housing, public, sector, employment, and, policing, showing, a, consistent, and, irrefutable, pattern, of, deliberate, discrimination, against, catholics, many, catholics, nationalists, saw, the, gerrymandered, local, electoral, boundaries, and, the, abolishing, of, proportional, representation, as, proof, of, government, sponsored, discrimination, until, 1969, a, system, was, in, place, called, plural, voting, which, was, a, practice, whereby, one, person, might, be, able, to, vote, multiple, times, in, an, election, property, and, business, owners, could, vote, both, in, the, constituency, where, their, property, lay, and, that, in, which, they, lived, if, the, two, were, different, this, system, often, resulted, in, one, person, being, able, to, cast, multiple, votes, decades, later, uup, first, minister, of, northern, ireland, david, trimble, said, that, northern, ireland, under, the, uup, had, been, a, cold, house, for, catholics, during, world, war, ii, recruitment, to, the, british, military, was, noticeably, lower, than, the, high, levels, reached, during, world, war, i, in, june, 1940, to, encourage, the, neutral, irish, state, to, join, with, the, allies, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, indicated, to, taoiseach, amon, de, valera, that, the, british, government, would, encourage, irish, unity, but, believing, that, churchill, could, not, deliver, de, valera, declined, the, offer, the, british, did, not, inform, the, government, of, northern, ireland, that, they, had, made, the, offer, to, the, dublin, government, and, de, valera, s, rejection, was, not, publicised, until, 1970, belfast, was, a, key, industrial, city, in, the, uk, s, war, effort, producing, ships, tanks, aircraft, and, munitions, the, unemployment, that, had, been, so, persistent, in, the, 1930s, disappeared, and, labour, shortages, appeared, prompting, migration, from, the, free, state, the, city, was, thinly, defended, and, had, only, 24, anti, aircraft, guns, richard, dawson, bates, the, minister, for, home, affairs, had, prepared, too, late, assuming, that, belfast, was, far, enough, away, to, be, safe, the, city, s, fire, brigade, was, inadequate, and, as, the, northern, ireland, government, had, been, reluctant, to, spend, money, on, air, raid, shelters, it, only, started, to, build, them, after, the, blitz, in, london, during, the, autumn, of, 1940, there, were, no, searchlights, in, the, city, which, made, shooting, down, enemy, bombers, more, difficult, in, april, may, 1941, the, belfast, blitz, began, when, the, luftwaffe, launched, a, series, of, raids, that, were, the, most, deadly, seen, outside, london, working, class, areas, in, the, north, and, east, of, the, city, were, particularly, hard, hit, and, over, 1, 000, people, were, killed, and, hundreds, were, seriously, injured, tens, of, thousands, of, people, fled, the, city, in, fear, of, future, attacks, in, the, final, raid, luftwaffe, bombs, inflicted, extensive, damage, to, the, docks, and, the, harland, wolff, shipyard, closing, it, for, six, months, half, of,

between, the, two, heads, of, government, since, partition, the, troubles, which, started, in, the, late, 1960s, consisted, of, about, 30, years, of, recurring, acts, of, intense, violence, during, which, 3, 254, people, were, killed, with, over, 50, 000, casualties, from, 1969, to, 2003, there, were, over, 36, 900, shooting, incidents, and, over, 16, 200, bombings, or, attempted, bombings,

included, only, rate, payers, and, their, spouses, and, so, excluded, over, a, quarter, of, the, electorate, while, the, majority, of, disenfranchised, electors, were, protestant, catholics, were, over, represented, since, they, were, poorer, and, had, more, adults, still, living, in, the, family, home, nicra, s, campaign, seen, by, many, unionists, as, an, irish, republican, front, and, the, violent, reaction, to, it, proved, to, be, a, precursor, to, a, more, violent, period, as, early, as, 1969, armed, campaigns, of, paramilitary, groups, began, including, the, provisional, ira, campaign, of, 1969, 1997, which, was, aimed, at, the, end, of, british, rule, in, northern, ireland, and, the, creation, of, a, united, ireland, and, the, ulster, volunteer, force, formed, in, 1966, in, response, to, the, perceived, erosion, of, both, the, british, character, and, unionist, domination, of, northern, ireland, the, state, security, forces, the, british, army, and, the, police, the, royal, ulster, constabulary, were, also, involved, in, the, violence, the, uk, government, s, position, is, that, its, forces, were, neutral, in, the, conflict, trying, to, uphold, law, and, order, in, northern, ireland, and, the, right, of, the, people, of, northern, ireland, to, democratic, self, determination, republicans, regarded, the, state, forces, as, combatants, in, the, conflict, pointing, to, the, collusion, between, the, state, forces, and, the, loyalist, paramilitaries, as, proof, of, this, the, ballast, investigation, by, the, police, ombudsman, for, northern, ireland, has, confirmed, that, british, forces, and, in, particular, the, ruc, did, collude, with, loyalist, paramilitaries, were, involved, in, murder, and, did, obstruct, the, course, of, justice, when, such, claims, had, been, investigated, although, the, extent, to, which, such, collusion, occurred, is, still, disputed, as, a, consequence, of, the, worsening, security, situation, the, autonomous, regional, government, for, northern, ireland, was, suspended, in, 1972, alongside, the, violence, there, was, a, political, deadlock, between, the, major, political, parties, in, northern, ireland, including, those, who, condemned, the, violence, over, the, future, status, of, northern, ireland, and, the, form, of, government, there, should, be, within, northern, ireland, in, 1973, northern, ireland, held, a, referendum, to, determine, if, it, should, remain, in, the, united, kingdom, or, be, part, of, a, united, ireland, the, vote, went, heavily, in, favour, 98, 9, of, maintaining, the, status, quo, approximately, 57, 5, of, the, total, electorate, voted, in, support, but, only, 1, of, catholics, voted, following, a, boycott, organised, by, the, social, democratic, and, labour, party, sdlp, the, troubles, were, brought, to, an, uneasy, end, by, a, peace, process, that, included, the, declaration, of, ceasefires, by, most, paramilitary, organisations, and, the, complete, decommissioning, of, their, weapons, the, reform, of, the, police, and, the, corresponding, withdrawal, of, army, troops, from, the, streets, and, sensitive, border, areas, such, as, south, armagh, and, fermanagh, as, agreed, by, the, signatories, to, the, belfast, agreement, commonly, known, as, the, good, friday, agreement, this, reiterated, the, long, held, british, position, which, had, never, before, been, fully, acknowledged, by, successive, irish, governments, that, northern, ireland, will, remain, within, the, united, kingdom, until, a, majority, of, voters, in, northern, ireland, decides, otherwise, the, constitution, of, ireland, was, amended, in, 1999, to, remove, a, claim, of, the, irish, nation, to, sovereignty, over, the, entire, island, in, article, 2, the, new, articles, 2, and, 3, added, to, the, constitution, to, replace, the, earlier, articles, implicitly, acknowledge, that, the, status, of, northern, ireland, and, its, relationships, within, the, rest, of, the, united, kingdom, and, with, the, republic, of, ireland, would, only, be, changed, with, the, agreement, of, a, majority, of, voters, in, each, jurisdiction, this, aspect, was, also, central, to, the, belfast, agreement, which, was, signed, in, 1998, and, ratified, by, referendums, held, simultaneously, in, both, northern, ireland, and, the, republic, at, the, same, time, the, uk, government, recognised, for, the, first, time, as, part, of, the, prospective, the, so, called, irish, dimension, the, principle, that, the, people, of, the, island, of, ireland, as, a, whole, have, the, right, without, any, outside, interference, to, solve, the, issues, between, north, and, south, by, mutual, consent, the, latter, statement, was, key, to, winning, support, for, the, agreement, from, nationalists, it, established, a, devolved, power, sharing, government, the, northern, ireland, assembly, located, on, the, stormont, estate, which, must, consist, of, both, unionist, and, nationalist, parties, these, institutions, were, suspended, by, the, uk, government, in, 2002, after, police, service, of, northern, ireland, psni, allegations, of, spying, by, people, working, for, sinn, f, in, at, the, assembly, stormontgate, the, resulting, case, against, the, accused, sinn, f, in, member, collapsed, on, 28, july, 2005, the, provisional, ira, declared, an, end, to, its, campaign, and, has, since, decommissioned, what, is, thought, to, be, all, of, its, arsenal, this, final, act, of, decommissioning, was, performed, under, the, watch, of, the, independent, international, commission, on, decommissioning, iicd, and, two, external, church, witnesses, many, unionists, however, remained, sceptical, the, iicd, later, confirmed, that, the, main, loyalist, paramilitary, groups, the, ulster, defence, association, uvf, and, the, red, hand, commando, had, decommissioned, what, is, thought, to, be, all, of, their, arsenals, witnessed, by, former, archbishop, robin, eames, and, a, former, top, civil, servant, politicians, elected, to, the, assembly, at, the, 2003, assembly, election, were, called, together, on, 15, may, 2006, under, the, northern, ireland, act, 2006, to, elect, a, first, minister, and, deputy, first, minister, of, northern, ireland, and, choose, the, members, of, an, executive, before, 25, november, 2006, as, a, preliminary, step, to, the, restoration, of, devolved, government, following, the, election, on, 7, march, 2007, the, devolved, government, returned, on, 8, may, 2007, with, democratic, unionist, party, dup, leader, ian, paisley, and, sinn, f, in, deputy, leader, martin, mcguinness, taking, office, as, first, minister, and, deputy, first, minister, respectively, in, its, white, paper, on, brexit, the, united, kingdom, government, reiterated, its, commitment, to, the, belfast, agreement, concerning, northern, ireland, s, status, it, said, that, the, uk, government, s, clearly, stated, preference, is, to, retain, northern, ireland, s, current, constitutional, position, as, part, of, the, uk, but, with, strong, links, to, ireland, on, 3, february, 2022, paul, givan, resigned, as, first, minister, which, automatically, resigned, michelle, o, neill, as, deputy, first, minister, and, collapsed, the, executive, of, northern, ireland, on, 30, january, 2024, leader, of, the, dup, jeffrey, donaldson, announced, that, the, dup, would, restore, an, executive, government, on, the, condition, that, new, legislation, was, passed, by, the, uk, house, of, commons, the, main, political, divide, in, northern, ireland, is, between, unionists, who, wish, to, see, northern, ireland, continue, as, part, of, the, united, kingdom, and, nationalists, who, wish, to, see, northern, ireland, unified, with, the, republic, of, ireland, independent, from, the, united, kingdom, these, two, opposing, views, are, linked, to, deeper, cultural, divisions, unionists, are, predominantly, ulster, protestant, descendants, of, mainly, scottish, english, and, huguenot, settlers, as, well, as, gaels, who, converted, to, one, of, the, protestant, denominations, nationalists, are, overwhelmingly, catholic, and, descend, from, the, population, predating, the, settlement, with, a, minority, from, the, scottish, highlands, as, well, as, some, converts, from, protestantism, discrimination, against, nationalists, under, the, stormont, government, 1921, 1972, gave, rise, to, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, 1960s, while, some, unionists, argue, that, discrimination, was, not, just, due, to, religious, or, political, bigotry, but, also, the, result, of, more, complex, socio, economic, socio, political, and, geographical, factors, its, existence, and, the, manner, in, which, nationalist, anger, at, it, was, handled, were, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, troubles, the, political, unrest, went, through, its, most, violent, phase, between, 1968, and, 1994, in, 2007, 36, of, the, population, defined, themselves, as, unionist, 24, as, nationalist, and, 40, defined, themselves, as, neither, according, to, a, 2015, opinion, poll, 70, express, a, long, term, preference, of, the, maintenance, of, northern, ireland, s, membership, of, the, united, kingdom, either, directly, ruled, or, with, devolved, government, while, 14, express, a, preference, for, membership, of, a, united, ireland, this, discrepancy, can, be, explained, by, the, overwhelming, preference, among, protestants, to, remain, a, part, of, the, uk, 93, while, catholic, preferences, are, spread, across, several, solutions, to, the, constitutional, question, including, remaining, a, part, of, the, uk, 47, a, united, ireland, 32, northern, ireland, becoming, an, independent, state, 4, and, those, who, don, t, know, 16, official, voting, figures, which, reflect, views, on, the, national, question, along, with, issues, of, the, candidate, geography, personal, loyalty, and,

the, election, results, are, not, necessarily, an, indication, of, the, electorate, s, stance, regarding, the, constitutional, status, of, northern, ireland, most, of, the, population, of, northern, ireland, is, at, least, nominally, christian, mostly, roman, catholic, and, protestant, denominations, many, voters, regardless, of, religious, affiliation, are, attracted, to, unionism, s, conservative, policies, while, other, voters, are, instead, attracted, to, the, traditionally, leftist, sinn, f, in, and, sdlp, and, their, respective, party, platforms, for, democratic, socialism, and, social, democracy, for, the, most, part, protestants, feel, a, strong, connection, with, great, britain, and, wish, for, northern, ireland, to, remain, part, of, the, united, kingdom, many, catholics, however, generally, aspire, to, a, united, ireland, or, are, less, certain, about, how, to, solve, the, constitutional, question, catholics, have, a, slight, majority, in, northern, ireland, according, to, the, latest, northern, ireland, census, the, make, up, of, the, northern, ireland, assembly, reflects, the, appeals, of, the, various, parties, within, the, population, of,

described, as, a, country, province, region, and, other, terms, officially, by, the, press, and, in, common, speech, the, choice, of, term, can, be, controversial, and, can, reveal, one, s, political, preferences, this, has, been, noted, as, a, problem, by, several, writers, on, northern, ireland, with, no, generally, recommended, solution, iso, 3166, 2, gb, defines, northern, ireland, as, a,

and, scotland, one, principality, wales, and, one, province, northern, ireland, however, this, term, can, be, controversial, particularly, for, nationalists, for, whom, the, title, province, is, properly, reserved, for, the, traditional, province, of, ulster, of, which, northern, ireland, comprises, six, out, of, nine, counties, some, authors, have, described, the, meaning, of, this, term, as, being, equivocal, referring, to, northern, ireland, as, being, a, province, both, of, the, united, kingdom, and, the, traditional, country, of, ireland, the, uk, office, for, national, statistics,

pronounce, as, aitch, as, in, british, english, and, catholics, tend, to, pronounce, as, haitch, as, in, hiberno, english, however, geography, is, a, much, more, important, determinant, of, dialect, than, religious, background, the, irish, language, irish, an, ghaeilge, or, gaelic, is, the, second, most, spoken, language, in, northern, ireland, and, is, a, native, language, of, ireland, it, was,

versions, of, a, gaelic, name, today, the, language, is, often, associated, with, irish, nationalism, and, thus, with, catholics, however, in, the, 19th, century, the, language, was, seen, as, a,
