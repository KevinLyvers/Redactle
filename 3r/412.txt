sundarbans, pronounced, s, n, d, r, b, n, z, is, a, mangrove, area, in, the, delta, formed, by, the, confluence, of, the, ganges, brahmaputra, and, meghna, rivers, in, the, bay, of, bengal, spread, across, parts, of, india, and, bangladesh, this, forest, is, the, largest, mangrove, forest, in, the, world, it, spans, the, area, from, the, baleswar, river, in, bangladesh, s, division, of, khulna, to, the, hooghly, river, in, india, s, state, of, west, bengal, it, comprises, closed, and, open, mangrove, forests, land, used, for, agricultural, purpose, mudflats, and, barren, land, and, is, intersected, by, multiple, tidal, streams, and, channels, sundarbans, is, home, to, the, world, s, largest, area, of, mangrove, forests, four, protected, areas, in, the, sundarbans, are, enlisted, as, unesco, world, heritage, sites, viz, sundarbans, west, bangladesh, sundarbans, south, bangladesh, sundarbans, east, bangladesh, and, sundarbans, national, park, india, despite, the, protected, status, the, indian, sundarbans, were, considered, endangered, in, a, 2020, assessment, under, the, iucn, red, list, of, ecosystems, framework, the, sundarbans, mangrove, forest, covers, an, area, of, about, 10, 277, km, 2, 3, 968, sq, mi, of, which, forests, in, bangladesh, s, khulna, division, extend, over, 6, 017, km, 2, 2, 323, sq, mi, and, in, west, bengal, s, presidency, division, they, extend, over, 4, 260, km, 2, 1, 640, sq, mi, across, the, south, 24, parganas, and, north, 24, parganas, districts, the, most, abundant, tree, species, are, sundri, heritiera, fomes, and, gewa, excoecaria, agallocha, the, forests, provide, habitat, to, 453, fauna, wildlife, including, 290, bird, 120, fish, 42, mammal, 35, reptile, and, eight, amphibian, species, despite, a, total, ban, on, all, killing, or, capture, of, wildlife, other, than, fish, and, some, invertebrates, there, has, been, a, consistent, pattern, of, depleted, biodiversity, or, loss, of, species, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, ecological, quality, of, the, forest, declining, despite, preservation, commitments, from, both, governments, the, sundarbans, are, under, threat, from, both, natural, and, human, made, causes, in, 2007, the, landfall, of, cyclone, sidr, damaged, around, 40, of, the, sundarbans, the, forest, is, also, suffering, from, increased, salinity, caused, by, sea, level, rise, due, to, effects, of, climate, change, and, reduced, freshwater, supply, in, may, 2009, cyclone, aila, devastated, the, sundarbans, with, massive, casualties, at, least, 100, 000, people, were, affected, by, this, cyclone, the, proposed, coal, fired, rampal, power, station, situated, 14, km, 8, 7, mi, north, of, the, sundarbans, at, rampal, upazila, of, bagerhat, district, in, khulna, bangladesh, is, anticipated, to, further, damage, this, unique, mangrove, forest, according, to, a, 2016, report, by, unesco, climate, change, is, expected, to, continue, to, negatively, affect, both, natural, systems, and, human, populations, in, the, region, resulting, in, further, ecosystem, degradation, and, climate, migration, experts, examining, the, region, recommend, further, focus, on, mangrove, restoration, and, management, and, advocating, for, adaptation, of, human, populations, through, processes, like, managed, retreat, and, investments, in, resilient, infrastructure, the, literal, meaning, of, sundarbans, bengali, romanized, sund, rb, n, is, beautiful, forest, alternatively, it, was, proposed, that, the, name, is, a, corruption, of, samudraban, shomudrob, n, sea, forest, or, chandra, bandhe, the, name, of, a, tribe, however, the, likely, origin, of, the, word, is, sundari, or, sundri, the, local, name, of, the, mangrove, species, heritiera, fomes, abundant, in, the, area, the, history, of, human, settlement, in, the, sundarbans, area, can, be, traced, back, to, mauryan, era, 4th, 2nd, century, bce, a, ruin, of, an, abandoned, city, was, found, in, the, baghmara, forest, block, that, is, attributed, to, chand, sadagar, a, pre, mauryan, semi, historical, figure, in, bengali, folklore, archaeological, excavation, at, kapilmuni, paikgacha, upazilla, north, of, the, sundarbans, in, bangladesh, revealed, ruins, of, urban, settlement, dating, back, to, the, early, middle, ages, during, the, mughal, period, forest, tracts, were, leased, out, by, the, local, rulers, for, establishing, settlements, in, 1757, the, british, east, india, company, obtained, proprietary, rights, over, sundarbans, from, the, mughal, emperor, alamgir, ii, and, completed, mapping, the, area, in, 1764, however, systematic, forest, management, started, a, century, later, the, first, forest, management, division, to, have, jurisdiction, over, the, sundarbans, was, established, in, 1869, in, 1875, a, large, portion, of, the, mangrove, forests, was, declared, as, reserved, forests, under, the, indian, forest, act, of, 1865, act, viii, of, 1865, the, remaining, portions, of, the, forests, were, declared, a, reserve, forest, the, following, year, and, the, forest, which, was, so, far, administered, by, the, civil, administration, district, was, placed, under, the, control, of, the, forest, department, a, forest, division, which, is, the, basic, forest, management, and, administration, unit, was, created, in, 1879, with, the, headquarters, in, today, khulna, bangladesh, the, first, management, plan, was, written, for, the, period, 1893, 1898, the, sundarban, forest, lies, in, the, vast, delta, on, the, bay, of, bengal, formed, by, the, super, confluence, of, the, hooghly, padma, both, are, distributaries, of, ganges, brahmaputra, and, meghna, rivers, across, southern, bangladesh, the, seasonally, flooded, sundarbans, freshwater, swamp, forest, lies, inland, from, the, mangrove, forests, on, the, coastal, fringe, the, forest, covers, 10, 277, km, 2, 3, 968, sq, mi, of, which, about, 6, 017, km, 2, 2, 323, sq, mi, are, in, bangladesh, the, indian, part, of, sundarbans, is, estimated, to, be, about, 4, 260, km, 2, 1, 640, sq, mi, of, which, about, 1, 700, km, 2, 660, sq, mi, is, occupied, by, water, bodies, in, the, forms, of, river, canals, and, creeks, of, width, varying, from, a, few, metres, to, several, kilometres, the, sundarbans, is, intersected, by, a, complex, network, of, tidal, waterways, mudflats, and, small, islands, of, salt, tolerant, mangrove, forests, the, interconnected, network, of, waterways, makes, almost, every, corner, of, the, forest, accessible, by, boat, the, area, is, known, for, the, bengal, tiger, panthera, tigris, as, well, as, numerous, fauna, including, species, of, birds, chital, crocodiles, and, snakes, the, fertile, soils, of, the, delta, have, been, subject, to, intensive, human, use, for, centuries, and, the, ecoregion, has, been, mostly, converted, to, intensive, agriculture, with, few, enclaves, of, forest, remaining, the, remaining, forests, taken, together, with, the, sundarbans, mangroves, are, important, habitat, for, the, endangered, tiger, additionally, the, mangroves, species, present, in, the, sundarban, area, serve, a, crucial, function, as, a, protective, barrier, for, the, millions, of, inhabitants, in, and, around, kolkata, khulna, and, port, of, mongla, against, the, floods, that, result, from, the, cyclones, it, also, protects, from, tsunami, and, soil, erosion, for, the, coastal, population, the, mangrove, dominated, ganges, delta, the, sundarbans, is, a, complex, ecosystem, comprising, one, of, the, three, largest, single, tracts, of, mangrove, forests, of, the, world, the, larger, part, is, situated, in, bangladesh, a, smaller, portion, of, it, lies, in, india, the, indian, part, of, the, forest, is, estimated, to, be, about, 40, percent, while, the, bangladeshi, part, is, 60, percent, to, the, south, the, forest, meets, the, bay, of, bengal, to, the, east, it, is, bordered, by, the, baleswar, river, and, to, the, north, there, is, a, sharp, interface, with, intensively, cultivated, land, the, natural, drainage, in, the, upstream, areas, other, than, the, main, river, channels, is, everywhere, impeded, by, extensive, embankments, and, polders, the, sundarbans, was, originally, measured, about, 200, years, ago, to, be, of, about, 16, 700, square, kilometres, 6, 400, sq, mi, now, it, has, dwindled, into, about, one, third, of, its, original, size, the, total, land, area, today, is, 4, 143, square, kilometres, 1, 600, sq, mi, including, exposed, sandbars, with, a, total, area, of, 42, square, kilometres, 16, sq, mi, the, remaining, water, area, of, 1, 874, square, kilometres, 724, sq, mi, encompasses, rivers, small, streams, and, canals, rivers, in, the, sundarbans, are, meeting, places, of, salt, water, and, freshwater, thus, it, is, a, region, of, transition, between, the, freshwater, of, the, rivers, originating, from, the, ganges, and, the, saline, water, of, the, bay, of, bengal, the, sundarbans, along, the, bay, of, bengal, has, evolved, over, the, millennia, through, natural, deposition, of, upstream, sediments, accompanied, by, intertidal, segregation, the, physiography, is, dominated, by, deltaic, formations, that, include, innumerable, drainage, lines, associated, with, surface, and, subaqueous, levees, splays, and, tidal, flats, there, are, also, marginal, marshes, above, mean, tide, level, tidal, sandbars, and, islands, with, their, networks, of, tidal, channels, subaqueous, distal, bars, and, proto, delta, clays, and, silt, sediments, the, sundarbans, floor, varies, from, 0, 9, to, 2, 11, metres, 3, 0, to, 6, 9, ft, above, sea, level, biotic, factors, here, play, a, significant, role, in, physical, coastal, evolution, and, for, wildlife, a, variety, of, habitats, have, developed, which, include, beaches, estuaries, permanent, and, semi, permanent, swamps, tidal, flats, tidal, creeks, coastal, dunes, back, dunes, and, levees, the, mangrove, vegetation, itself, assists, in, the, formation, of, new, landmass, and, the, intertidal, vegetation, plays, a, significant, role, in, swamp, morphology, the, activities, of, mangrove, fauna, in, the, intertidal, mudflats, develop, micromorphological, features, that, trap, and, hold, sediments, to, create, a, substratum, for, mangrove, seeds, the, morphology, and, evolution, of, the, eolian, dunes, is, controlled, by, an, abundance, of, xerophytic, and, halophytic, plants, creepers, grasses, and, sedges, stabilise, sand, dunes, and, uncompacted, sediments, the, sunderbans, mudflats, banerjee, 1998, are, found, at, the, estuary, and, on, the, deltaic, islands, where, low, velocity, of, river, and, tidal, current, occurs, the, flats, are, exposed, in, low, tides, and, submerged, in, high, tides, thus, being, changed, morphologically, even, in, one, tidal, cycle, the, tides, are, so, large, that, approximately, one, third, of, the, land, disappears, and, reappears, every, day, the, interior, parts, of, the, mudflats, serve, as, a, perfect, home, for, mangroves, sundarbans, features, two, ecoregions, sundarbans, freshwater, swamp, forests, im0162, and, sundarbans, mangroves, im1406, the, sundarbans, freshwater, swamp, forests, are, a, tropical, moist, broadleaf, forest, ecoregion, of, bangladesh, and, india, it, represents, the, brackish, swamp, forests, that, lie, behind, the, sundarbans, mangroves, where, the, salinity, is, more, pronounced, the, freshwater, ecoregion, is, an, area, where, the, water, is, only, slightly, brackish, and, becomes, quite, fresh, during, the, rainy, season, when, the, freshwater, plumes, from, the, ganges, and, the, brahmaputra, rivers, push, the, intruding, salt, water, out, and, bring, a, deposit, of, silt, it, covers, 14, 600, square, kilometres, 5, 600, sq, mi, of, the, vast, ganges, brahmaputra, delta, finishing, at, the, mouth, of, the, bay, of, bengal, from, the, northern, part, of, khulna, district, and, the, southern, part, of, north, 24, parganas, district, in, the, indian, state, of, west, bengal, the, sundarbans, freshwater, swamp, forests, lie, between, the, upland, lower, gangetic, plains, moist, deciduous, forests, and, the, brackish, water, sundarbans, mangroves, bordering, the, bay, of, bengal, a, victim, of, large, scale, clearing, and, settlement, to, support, one, of, the, densest, human, populations, in, asia, this, ecoregion, is, under, a, great, threat, of, extinction, hundreds, of, years, of, habitation, and, exploitation, have, exacted, a, heavy, toll, on, this, ecoregion, s, habitat, and, biodiversity, there, are, two, protected, areas, narendrapur, 110, km, 2, and, ata, danga, baor, 20, km, 2, that, cover, a, mere, 130, km, 2, of, the, ecoregion, habitat, loss, in, this, ecoregion, is, so, extensive, and, the, remaining, habitat, is, so, fragmented, that, it, is, difficult, to, ascertain, the, composition, of, the, original, vegetation, of, this, ecoregion, according, to, champion, and, seth, 1968, the, freshwater, swamp, forests, are, characterised, by, heritiera, minor, xylocarpus, molluccensis, bruguiera, conjugata, sonneratia, apetala, avicennia, officinalis, and, sonneratia, caseolaris, with, pandanus, tectorius, hibiscus, tiliaceus, and, nipa, fruticans, along, the, fringing, banks, the, sundarbans, mangroves, ecoregion, on, the, coast, forms, the, seaward, fringe, of, the, delta, and, is, the, world, s, largest, mangrove, ecosystem, with, 20, 400, square, kilometres, 7, 900, sq, mi, of, an, area, covered, the, dominant, mangrove, species, heritiera, fomes, is, locally, known, as, sundri, or, sundari, mangrove, forests, are, not, home, to, a, great, variety, of, plants, they, have, a, thick, canopy, and, the, undergrowth, is, mostly, seedlings, of, the, mangrove, trees, besides, the, sundari, other, tree, species, in, the, forest, include, avicennia, xylocarpus, mekongensis, xylocarpus, granatum, sonneratia, apetala, bruguiera, gymnorhiza, ceriops, decandra, aegiceras, corniculatum, rhizophora, mucronata, and, nypa, fruticans, palms, twenty, six, of, the, fifty, broad, mangrove, species, found, in, the, world, grow, well, in, the, sundarbans, the, commonly, identifiable, vegetation, types, in, the, dense, sundarbans, mangrove, forests, are, salt, water, mixed, forest, mangrove, scrub, brackish, water, mixed, forest, littoral, forest, wet, forest, and, wet, alluvial, grass, forests, the, bangladesh, mangrove, vegetation, of, the, sundarbans, differs, greatly, from, other, non, deltaic, coastal, mangrove, forests, and, upland, forests, associations, unlike, the, former, the, rhizophoraceae, are, of, minor, importance, ecological, succession, is, generally, defined, as, the, successive, occupation, of, a, site, by, different, plant, communities, in, an, accreting, mudflats, the, outer, community, along, the, sequence, represents, the, pioneer, community, which, is, gradually, replaced, by, the, next, community, representing, the, seral, stages, and, finally, by, a, climax, community, typical, of, the, climatic, zone, robert, scott, troup, suggested, that, succession, began, in, the, newly, accreted, land, created, by, fresh, deposits, of, eroded, soil, the, pioneer, vegetation, on, these, newly, accreted, sites, is, sonneratia, followed, by, avicennia, and, nypa, as, the, ground, is, elevated, as, a, result, of, soil, deposition, other, trees, make, their, appearance, the, most, prevalent, though, one, of, the, late, species, to, appear, is, excoecaria, as, the, level, of, land, rises, through, accretion, and, the, land, is, only, occasionally, flooded, by, tides, heritiera, fomes, begins, to, appear, a, total, of, 245, genera, and, 334, plant, species, were, recorded, by, david, prain, in, 1903, while, most, of, the, mangroves, in, other, parts, of, the, world, are, characterised, by, members, of, the, rhizophoraceae, avicenneaceae, or, combretaceae, the, mangroves, of, bangladesh, are, dominated, by, the, malvaceae, and, euphorbiaceae, the, sundarbans, flora, is, characterised, by, the, abundance, of, sundari, heritiera, fomes, gewa, excoecaria, agallocha, goran, ceriops, decandra, and, keora, sonneratia, apetala, all, of, which, occur, prominently, throughout, the, area, the, characteristic, tree, of, the, forest, is, the, sundari, heritiera, littoralis, from, which, the, name, of, the, forest, had, probably, been, derived, it, yields, a, hard, wood, used, for, building, houses, and, making, boats, furniture, and, other, things, new, forest, accretions, is, often, conspicuously, dominated, by, keora, sonneratia, apetala, and, tidal, forests, it, is, an, indicator, species, for, newly, accreted, mudbanks, and, is, an, important, species, for, wildlife, especially, spotted, deer, axis, axis, there, is, abundance, of, dhundul, or, passur, xylocarpus, granatum, and, kankra, bruguiera, gymnorhiza, though, distribution, is, discontinuous, among, palms, poresia, coaractata, myriostachya, wightiana, and, golpata, nypa, fruticans, and, among, grasses, spear, grass, imperata, cylindrica, and, khagra, phragmites, karka, are, well, distributed, the, varieties, of, the, forests, that, exist, in, sundarbans, include, mangrove, scrub, littoral, forest, saltwater, mixed, forest, brackish, water, mixed, forest, and, swamp, forest, besides, the, forest, there, are, extensive, areas, of, brackish, water, and, freshwater, marshes, intertidal, mudflats, sandflats, sand, dunes, with, typical, dune, vegetation, open, grassland, on, sandy, soils, and, raised, areas, supporting, a, variety, of, terrestrial, shrubs, and, trees, since, prain, s, report, there, have, been, considerable, changes, in, the, status, of, various, mangrove, species, and, taxonomic, revision, of, the, man, grove, flora, however, very, little, exploration, of, the, botanical, nature, of, the, sundarbans, has, been, made, to, keep, up, with, these, changes, differences, in, vegetation, have, been, explained, in, terms, of, freshwater, and, low, salinity, influences, in, the, northeast, and, variations, in, drainage, and, siltation, the, sundarbans, has, been, classified, as, a, moist, tropical, forest, demonstrating, a, whole, mosaic, of, seres, comprising, primary, colonisation, on, new, accretions, to, more, mature, beach, forests, historically, vegetation, types, have, been, recognised, in, broad, correlation, with, varying, degrees, of, water, salinity, freshwater, flushing, and, physiography, the, sundarbans, provides, a, unique, ecosystem, and, a, rich, wildlife, habitat, according, to, the, 2015, tiger, census, in, bangladesh, and, the, 2011, tiger, census, in, india, the, sundarbans, have, about, 180, tigers, 106, in, bangladesh, and, 74, in, india, earlier, estimates, based, on, counting, unique, pugmarks, were, much, higher, the, more, recent, counts, have, used, camera, traps, an, improved, methodology, that, yields, more, accurate, results, tiger, attacks, were, historically, common, in, the, area, and, are, still, frequent, in, the, sundarbans, with, around, 40, people, killed, in, 2000, 2010, most, importantly, mangroves, are, a, transition, from, the, marine, to, freshwater, and, terrestrial, systems, and, provide, critical, habitat, for, numerous, species, of, small, fish, crabs, shrimps, and, other, crustaceans, that, adapt, to, feed, and, shelter, and, reproduce, among, the, tangled, mass, of, roots, known, as, pneumatophores, which, grow, upward, from, the, anaerobic, mud, to, get, the, supply, of, oxygen, a, 1991, study, has, revealed, that, the, indian, part, of, the, sundarbans, supports, diverse, biological, resources, including, at, least, 150, species, of, commercially, important, fish, 270, species, of, birds, 42, species, of, mammals, 35, reptiles, and, 8, amphibian, species, although, new, ones, are, being, discovered, this, represents, a, significant, proportion, of, the, species, present, in, bangladesh, i, e, about, 30, of, the, reptiles, 37, the, birds, and, 34, of, the, mammals, and, includes, many, species, which, are, now, extinct, elsewhere, in, the, country, two, amphibians, 14, reptiles, 25, aves, and, five, mammals, are, endangered, the, sundarbans, is, an, important, wintering, area, for, migrant, water, birds, and, is, an, area, suitable, for, watching, and, studying, avifauna, the, management, of, wildlife, is, restricted, to, firstly, the, protection, of, fauna, from, poaching, and, secondly, designation, of, some, areas, as, wildlife, sanctuaries, where, no, extraction, of, forest, produce, is, allowed, and, where, the, wildlife, face, few, disturbances, although, the, fauna, of, bangladesh, have, diminished, in, recent, times, and, the, sundarbans, has, not, been, spared, from, this, decline, the, mangrove, forest, retains, several, good, wildlife, habitats, and, their, associated, fauna, of, these, the, tiger, and, dolphin, are, target, species, for, planning, wildlife, management, and, tourism, development, there, are, high, profile, and, vulnerable, mammals, living, in, two, contrasting, environments, and, their, statuses, and, management, are, strong, indicators, of, the, general, condition, and, management, of, wildlife, some, species, are, protected, by, legislation, notably, by, the, bangladesh, wildlife, preservation, order, 1973, p, o, 23, of, 1973, the, sundarbans, are, an, important, habitat, for, the, bengal, tiger, panthera, tigris, the, forest, also, provides, habitat, for, small, wild, cats, such, as, the, jungle, cat, felis, chaus, fishing, cat, prionailurus, viverrinus, and, leopard, cat, p, bengalensis, several, predators, dwell, in, the, labyrinth, of, channels, branches, and, roots, that, poke, up, into, the, air, this, is, the, only, mangrove, ecoregion, that, harbors, the, indo, pacific, region, s, largest, terrestrial, predator, the, bengal, tiger, unlike, in, other, habitats, tigers, live, here, and, swim, among, the, mangrove, islands, where, they, hunt, scarce, prey, such, as, the, chital, deer, axis, axis, indian, muntjacs, muntiacus, muntjak, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, and, rhesus, macaque, macaca, mulatta, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, now, 180, bengal, tigers, and, about, 30, 000, spotted, deer, in, the, area, the, tigers, are, known, to, attack, and, kill, humans, who, venture, into, the, forest, with, around, 40, deaths, recorded, in, 2000, 2010, forest, inventories, reveal, a, decline, in, standing, volume, of, the, two, main, commercial, mangrove, species, sundari, heritiera, spp, and, gewa, excoecaria, agallocha, by, 40, and, 45, respectively, between, 1959, and, 1983, despite, a, total, ban, on, all, killing, or, capture, of, wildlife, other, than, fish, and, some, invertebrates, it, appears, that, there, is, a, consistent, pattern, of, depleted, biodiversity, or, loss, of, species, notably, at, least, six, mammals, and, one, important, reptile, in, the, 20th, century, and, that, the, ecological, quality, of, the, original, mangrove, forest, is, declining, the, endangered, species, that, live, within, the, sundarbans, and, extinct, species, that, used, to, be, include, the, bengal, tiger, estuarine, crocodile, northern, river, terrapin, batagur, baska, olive, ridley, sea, turtle, gangetic, dolphin, ground, turtles, hawksbill, sea, turtles, and, king, crabs, horse, shoe, the, sundarbans, hold, globally, important, numbers, of, the, critically, endangered, masked, finfoot, and, are, important, wintering, sites, for, the, spoon, billed, sandpiper, and, the, indian, skimmer, some, species, such, as, hog, deer, axis, porcinus, water, buffalos, bubalus, bubalis, barasingha, or, swamp, deer, cervus, duvauceli, javan, rhinoceros, rhinoceros, sondaicus, indian, rhinoceros, rhinoceros, unicornis, and, the, mugger, crocodile, crocodylus, palustris, started, to, become, extinct, in, the, sundarbans, towards, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, because, of, extensive, poaching, and, hunting, by, the, british, and, locals, there, are, other, threatened, mammal, species, such, as, the, capped, langur, semnopithecus, pileatus, smooth, coated, otter, lutrogale, perspicillata, asian, small, clawed, otter, aonyx, cinerea, and, large, indian, civet, viverra, zibetha, the, physical, development, processes, along, the, coast, are, influenced, by, a, multitude, of, factors, comprising, wave, motions, micro, and, macro, tidal, cycles, and, long, shore, currents, typical, to, the, coastal, tract, the, shore, currents, vary, greatly, along, with, the, monsoon, these, are, also, affected, by, cyclonic, action, erosion, and, accretion, through, these, forces, maintains, varying, levels, as, yet, not, properly, measured, of, physiographic, change, whilst, the, mangrove, vegetation, itself, provides, a, remarkable, stability, to, the, entire, system, during, each, monsoon, season, almost, all, the, bengal, delta, is, submerged, much, of, it, for, half, a, year, the, sediment, of, the, lower, delta, plain, is, primarily, advected, inland, by, monsoonal, coastal, setup, and, cyclonic, events, one, of, the, greatest, challenges, people, living, on, the, ganges, delta, may, face, in, coming, years, is, the, threat, of, rising, sea, levels, caused, mostly, by, subsidence, in, the, region, and, partly, by, climate, change, in, many, of, the, bangladesh, s, mangrove, wetlands, freshwater, reaching, the, mangroves, was, considerably, reduced, from, the, 1970s, because, of, diversion, of, freshwater, in, the, upstream, area, by, neighbouring, india, through, the, use, of, the, farakka, barrage, bordering, rajshahi, bangladesh, also, the, bengal, basin, is, slowly, tilting, towards, the, east, because, of, neo, tectonic, movement, forcing, greater, freshwater, input, to, the, bangladesh, sundarbans, as, a, result, the, salinity, of, the, bangladesh, sundarbans, is, much, lower, than, that, of, the, indian, side, a, 1990, study, noted, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, environmental, degradation, in, the, himalayas, or, a, greenhouse, induced, rise, in, sea, level, have, aggravated, floods, in, bangladesh, however, a, 2007, report, by, unesco, case, studies, on, climate, change, and, world, heritage, has, stated, that, an, anthropogenic, 45, centimetre, 18, in, rise, in, sea, level, likely, by, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, combined, with, other, forms, of, anthropogenic, stress, on, the, sundarbans, could, lead, to, the, destruction, of, 75, percent, of, the, sundarbans, mangroves, already, lohachara, island, and, new, moore, island, south, talpatti, island, have, disappeared, under, the, sea, and, ghoramara, island, is, half, submerged, in, a, study, conducted, in, 2012, the, zoological, society, of, london, zsl, found, out, that, the, sunderban, coast, was, retreating, up, to, 200, metres, 660, ft, in, a, year, agricultural, activities, had, destroyed, around, 17, 179, hectares, 42, 450, acres, of, mangroves, within, three, decades, 1975, 2010, shrimp, cultivation, had, destroyed, another, 7, 554, hectares, 18, 670, acres, researches, from, the, school, of, oceanographic, studies, jadavpur, university, estimated, the, annual, rise, in, sea, level, to, be, 8, millimetres, 0, 31, in, in, 2010, it, had, doubled, from, 3, 14, millimetres, 0, 124, in, recorded, in, 2000, the, rising, sea, levels, had, also, submerged, around, 7, 500, hectares, 19, 000, acres, of, forest, areas, this, coupled, with, an, around, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, rise, in, surface, water, temperatures, and, increased, levels, of, salinity, have, posed, a, problem, for, the, survival, of, the, indigenous, flora, and, fauna, the, sundari, trees, are, exceptionally, sensitive, to, salinity, and, are, being, threatened, with, extinction, loss, of, the, mangrove, forest, will, result, in, the, loss, of, the, protective, biological, shield, against, cyclones, and, tsunamis, this, may, put, the, surrounding, coastal, communities, at, high, risk, moreover, the, submergence, of, land, mass, have, rendered, up, to, 6, 000, families, homeless, and, around, 70, 000, people, are, immediately, threatened, with, the, same, this, is, causing, the, flight, of, human, capital, to, the, mainland, about, 13, in, the, decade, of, 2000, 2010, a, 2015, ethnographic, study, conducted, by, a, team, of, researchers, from, heidelberg, university, in, germany, found, a, crisis, brewing, in, the, sunderbans, the, study, contended, that, poor, planning, on, the, part, of, the, india, and, bangladesh, governments, coupled, with, natural, ecological, changes, were, forcing, the, flight, of, human, capital, from, the, region, according, to, a, report, created, by, unesco, the, landfall, of, cyclone, sidr, damaged, around, 40, of, sundarbans, in, 2007, in, august, 2010, a, memorandum, of, understanding, was, signed, between, bangladesh, power, development, board, bpdb, and, india, s, state, owned, national, thermal, power, corporation, ntpc, where, they, designated, to, implement, the, coal, fired, rampal, power, station, by, 2016, the, proposed, project, on, an, area, of, over, 1, 834, acres, of, land, is, situated, 14, kilometres, 8, 7, mi, north, of, the, sundarbans, this, project, violates, the, environmental, impact, assessment, guidelines, for, coal, based, thermal, power, plants, environmental, activists, contend, that, the, proposed, location, of, the, rampal, station, would, violate, provisions, of, the, ramsar, convention, the, government, of, bangladesh, rejected, the, allegations, that, the, coal, based, power, plant, would, adversely, affect, the, world, s, largest, mangrove, forest, on, 9, december, 2014, an, oil, tanker, named, southern, star, vii, carrying, 358, 000, litres, 79, 000, imp, gal, 95, 000, us, gal, of, furnace, oil, was, sunk, in, the, sela, river, of, sundarbans, after, it, had, been, hit, by, a, cargo, vessel, the, oil, spread, over, 350, km, 2, 140, sq, mi, area, after, the, clash, as, of, 17, december, the, slick, spread, to, a, second, river, and, a, network, of, canals, in, the, sundarbans, and, blackened, the, shoreline, the, event, was, very, threatening, to, trees, plankton, and, vast, populations, of, small, fishes, and, dolphins, the, event, occurred, at, a, protected, sundarbans, mangrove, area, home, to, the, rare, irrawaddy, and, ganges, dolphins, until, 15, december, 2014, only, 50, 000, litres, 11, 000, imp, gal, 13, 000, us, gal, of, oil, from, the, area, had, been, cleaned, up, by, local, residents, the, bangladesh, navy, and, the, government, of, bangladesh, some, reports, indicated, that, the, event, killed, some, wildlife, on, 13, december, 2014, a, dead, irrawaddy, dolphin, was, seen, floating, on, the, harintana, tembulbunia, channel, of, the, sela, river, the, sundarbans, plays, an, important, role, in, the, economy, of, the, southwestern, region, of, bangladesh, as, well, as, in, the, national, economy, it, is, the, single, largest, source, of, forest, produce, in, the, country, the, forest, provides, raw, materials, for, wood, based, industries, in, addition, to, traditional, forest, produce, like, timber, fuelwood, pulpwood, etc, large, scale, harvest, of, non, wood, forest, products, such, as, thatching, materials, honey, beeswax, fish, crustacean, and, mollusc, resources, of, the, forest, takes, place, regularly, the, vegetated, tidal, lands, of, the, sundarbans, function, as, an, essential, habitat, produces, nutrients, and, purifies, water, the, forest, also, traps, nutrient, and, sediment, acts, as, a, storm, barrier, shore, stabiliser, and, energy, storage, unit, last, but, not, the, least, the, sunderbans, provides, an, aesthetic, attraction, for, local, and, foreign, tourists, the, water, houseboat, in, the, sundarbans, is, also, a, recent, attraction, among, the, tourists, the, forest, has, immense, protective, and, productive, functions, constituting, 51, of, the, total, reserved, forest, estate, of, bangladesh, it, contributes, about, 41, of, total, forest, revenue, and, accounts, for, about, 45, of, all, timber, and, fuel, wood, output, of, the, country, a, number, of, industries, e, g, newsprint, mill, match, factory, hardboard, boat, building, furniture, making, are, based, on, raw, materials, obtained, from, the, sundarbans, ecosystem, non, timber, forest, products, and, plantations, help, generate, considerable, employment, and, income, opportunities, for, at, least, half, a, million, poor, coastal, people, it, provides, natural, protection, to, life, and, properties, of, the, coastal, population, in, cyclone, prone, bangladesh, part, of, the, sundarbans, is, shielded, from, tidal, inflow, by, leaves, and, there, one, finds, villages, and, agriculture, during, the, monsoon, season, the, low, lying, agricultural, lands, are, waterlogged, and, the, summer, crop, kharif, crop, is, therefore, mainly, deepwater, rice, or, floating, rice, in, the, dry, winter, season, the, land, is, normally, uncropped, and, used, for, cattle, grazing, however, the, lands, near, the, villages, are, irrigated, from, ponds, that, were, filled, up, during, monsoon, and, vegetable, crops, rabi, crops, can, be, grown, here, some, farms, and, mangrove, areas, are, being, cleared, for, aquaculture, the, sundarbans, has, a, population, of, over, 4, million, but, much, of, it, is, mostly, free, of, permanent, human, habitation, despite, human, habitations, and, a, century, of, economic, exploitation, of, the, forest, well, into, the, late, 1940s, the, sundarbans, retained, a, forest, closure, of, about, 70, according, to, the, overseas, development, administration, oda, of, the, united, kingdom, in, 1980, the, sundarbans, area, is, one, of, the, most, densely, populated, areas, in, the, world, and, the, population, is, increasing, as, a, result, half, of, this, ecoregion, s, mangrove, forests, have, been, cut, down, to, supply, fuelwood, and, other, natural, resources, despite, the, intense, and, large, scale, exploitation, this, still, is, one, of, the, largest, contiguous, areas, of, mangroves, in, the, world, another, threat, comes, from, deforestation, and, water, diversion, from, the, rivers, inland, which, causes, far, more, silt, to, be, brought, to, the, estuary, clogging, up, the, waterways, the, directorate, of, forest,
