the, great, artesian, basin, gab, of, australia, is, the, largest, and, deepest, artesian, basin, in, the, world, extending, over, 1, 700, 000, square, kilometres, 660, 000, sq, mi, measured, water, temperatures, range, from, 30, to, 100, c, 86, to, 212, f, the, basin, provides, the, only, source, of, fresh, water, through, much, of, inland, australia, the, basin, underlies, 22, of, the, australian, continent, including, most, of, queensland, the, south, east, corner, of, the, northern, territory, north, eastern, south, australia, and, northern, new, south, wales, it, is, 3000, metres, 9800, feet, deep, in, places, and, is, estimated, to, contain, 64, 900, cubic, kilometres, 15, 600, cubic, miles, of, groundwater, the, great, artesian, basin, coordinating, committee, gabcc, coordinates, activity, between, federal, state, territory, and, local, levels, of, government, and, community, organisations, this, area, is, one, of, the, distinct, physiographic, provinces, of, the, larger, east, australian, basins, division, and, includes, the, smaller, wilcannia, threshold, physiographic, section, the, water, of, the, great, artesian, basin, is, held, in, a, sandstone, layer, laid, down, by, continental, erosion, of, higher, ground, during, the, triassic, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, periods, during, a, time, when, much, of, what, is, now, inland, australia, was, below, sea, level, the, sandstone, was, covered, by, a, layer, of, marine, sedimentary, rock, which, formed, a, confining, layer, that, trapped, water, in, the, sandstone, aquifer, the, eastern, edge, of, the, basin, was, uplifted, when, the, great, dividing, range, formed, the, other, side, was, created, from, the, landforms, of, the, central, eastern, lowlands, and, the, great, western, plateau, to, the, west, most, recharge, water, enters, the, rock, formations, from, relatively, high, ground, near, the, eastern, edge, of, the, basin, in, queensland, and, new, south, wales, and, very, gradually, flows, toward, the, south, and, west, a, much, smaller, amount, enters, along, the, western, margin, in, arid, central, australia, flowing, to, the, south, and, east, through, the, permeable, sandstone, at, a, rate, of, one, to, five, metres, per, year, discharge, water, eventually, exits, through, a, number, of, springs, and, seeps, mostly, in, the, southern, part, of, the, basin, the, age, of, the, groundwater, determined, by, carbon, 14, and, chlorine, 36, measurements, combined, with, hydraulic, modelling, ranges, from, several, thousand, years, for, the, recharge, areas, in, the, north, to, nearly, 2, million, years, in, the, south, western, discharge, zones, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, waters, of, the, great, artesian, basin, gab, discharged, through, mound, springs, many, in, arid, south, australia, such, as, witjira, dalhousie, springs, these, springs, sustained, a, variety, of, endemic, invertebrates, such, as, molluscs, and, supported, extensive, aboriginal, communities, and, trade, routes, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, springs, facilitated, exploration, and, allowed, the, provision, of, faster, communications, between, south, eastern, australia, and, europe, via, the, australian, overland, telegraph, line, the, great, artesian, basin, became, an, important, water, supply, for, cattle, stations, irrigation, and, livestock, and, domestic, purposes, and, is, a, vital, life, line, for, rural, australia, to, tap, it, boreholes, are, drilled, down, to, a, suitable, rock, layer, and, the, pressure, of, the, water, often, forces, it, up, without, the, need, for, pumps, the, discovery, and, use, of, the, water, in, the, great, artesian, basin, allowed, the, settlement, of, thousands, of, square, kilometres, of, country, away, from, rivers, in, inland, new, south, wales, queensland, and, south, australia, that, would, otherwise, have, been, unavailable, for, pastoral, activities, european, discovery, of, the, basin, dates, from, 1878, when, a, shallow, bore, near, bourke, produced, flowing, water, there, were, similar, discoveries, in, 1886, at, back, creek, east, of, barcaldine, and, in, 1887, near, cunnamulla, in, essence, water, extraction, from, the, gab, is, a, mining, operation, with, recharge, much, less, than, current, extraction, rates, in, 1915, there, were, 1, 500, bores, providing, 2, 000, megalitres, 1, 600, acre, ft, of, water, per, day, but, today, the, total, output, has, dropped, to, 1, 500, megalitres, 1, 200, acre, ft, per, day, this, included, just, under, 2, 000, freely, flowing, bores, and, more, than, 9, 000, that, required, mechanical, power, to, bring, water, to, the, surface, many, bores, are, unregulated, or, abandoned, resulting, in, considerable, water, wastage, these, problems, have, existed, for, many, decades, and, in, january, 2007, the, australian, commonwealth, government, announced, additional, funding, in, an, attempt, to, bring, them, under, control, however, many, of, the, mound, springs, referred, to, above, have, dried, up, due, to, a, drop, in, water, pressure, probably, resulting, in, extinction, of, several, invertebrate, species, the, olympic, dam, mine, in, south, australia, is, permitted, to, extract, up, to, 42, megalitres, 1, 5, 10, 6, cu, ft, of, water, daily, from, the, great, artesian, basin, under, the, roxby, downs, indenture, ratification, act, 1982, the, underground, copper, and, uranium, mine, commenced, operations, in, 1988, and, is, expected, to, continue, operating, until, approximately, 2060, in, addition, the, basin, provides, water, via, a, 1, 2, kilometre, deep, 3, 4, mi, bore, for, a, geothermal, power, station, at, birdsville, water, emerges, from, the, bore, at, 98, c, 208, f, and, provides, 25, of, the, town, s, electricity, needs, after, being, cooled, the, water, is, also, the, source, of, the, town, s, drinking, water, the, great, artesian, basin, underlies, parts, of, queensland, new, south, wales, south, australia, and, the, northern, territory, which, each, operate, under, different, legislative, frameworks, policies, and, resource, management, approaches, in, 2020, the, australian, government, department, of, climate, change, energy, the, environment, and, water, published, the, great, artesian, basin, strategic, management, plan, which, was, prepared, together, with, the, individual, governments, and, in, consultation, with, the, gabcc, stakeholders, and, public, feedback, the, great, artesian, basin, coordinating, committee, gabcc, provides, advice, from, community, organisations, and, agencies, to, state, territory, and, australian, government, ministers, on, efficient, effective, and, sustainable, whole, of, basin, resource, management, and, to, coordinate, activity, between, stakeholders, membership, of, the, committee, comprises, all, state, territory, and, australian, government, agencies, with, responsibilities, for, management, of, parts, of, the, great, artesian, basin, community, representatives, nominated, by, agencies, and, sector, representatives, in, 2011, abc, tv, s, public, affairs, program, four, corners, revealed, that, significant, concerns, were, being, expressed, about, depletion, and, chemical, damage, to, the, basin, as, a, result, of, coal, seam, gas, extraction, in, one, incident, reported, in, the, program, the, queensland, gas, company, qgc, fracked, its, myrtle, 3, well, connecting, the, springbok, aquifer, to, the, coal, seam, below, the, walloon, coal, measures, in, 2009, a, local, farmer, was, concerned, that, the, process, might, have, released, 130, litres, 29, imp, gal, 34, us, gal, of, a, potentially, toxic, chemical, into, the, basin, qgc, admitted, the, incident, but, did, not, alert, authorities, or, nearby, water, users, about, the, problem, until, thirteen, months, after, the, incident, the, safety, data, sheet, qgc, had, submitted, for, the, hydraulic, fracturing, chemical, was, derived, from, the, united, states, incomplete, and, ten, years, out, of, date, over, thirty, chemicals, may, be, used, in, the, process, of, hydraulic, fracturing, and, their, long, term, impact, on, aquifers, agriculture, and, people, supported, by, them, has, been, quantifiable, and, verified, for, quite, some, time, lead, aluminium, arsenic, barium, boron, nickel, and, uranium, have, all, been, found, beyond, recommended, levels, in, the, groundwater, contaminated, by, coal, seam, gas, instances, of, groundwater, being, contaminated, and, by, extension, poisoning, the, ecosystems, sustained, by, the, availability, of, groundwater, have, been, widely, documented, and, are, an, exacerbating, factor, in, regards, to, the, population, s, capability, to, cope, with, drought, through, usage, of, groundwater, sources, in, australia, glencore, planned, to, inject, up, to, 110, 000, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, per, year, into, a, groundwater, formation, in, the, basin, hydrogeologist, ned, hamer, stated, that, the, carbon, dioxide, would, increase, the, acidity, of, the, water, to, the, extent, that, it, would, dissolve, the, rock, releasing, heavy, metals, into, the, water, and, making, it, unusable, the, queensland, government, rejected, the, proposal, and, subsequently, banned, carbon, capture, using, the, great, artesian, basin
