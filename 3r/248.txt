first, european, forts, in, the, americas, la, navidad, 1492, 1493, as, well, as, the, first, settlement, and, proper, town, la, isabela, 1493, 1500, and, the, first, permanent, settlement, the, current, capital, of, the, dominican, republic, santo, domingo, est, 1498, these, settlements, were, founded, successively, during, each, of, christopher, columbus, s, first, three, voyages, the, spanish, empire, controlled, the, entire, island, of, hispaniola, from, the, 1490s, until, the, 17th, century, when, french, pirates, began, establishing, bases, on, the, western, side, of, the, island, the, official, name, was, la, espa, ola, meaning, the, spanish, island, it, was, also, called, santo, domingo, after, saint, dominic, the, island, was, called, various, names, by, its, native, people, the, ta, no, the, taino, had, no, written, language, hence, historical, evidence, for, these, names, comes, through, three, european, historians, the, italian, peter, martyr, d, anghiera, and, the, spaniards, bartolom, de, las, casas, and, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, based, on, a, comprehensive, survey, and, map, prepared, by, andr, s, de, morales, in, 1508, martyr, reported, that, the, island, as, a, whole, was, called, quizquella, or, quisqueya, and, ayiti, referred, to, a, rugged, mountainous, region, on, the, western, end, of, the, island, diego, lvarez, chanca, a, physician, on, columbus, s, second, voyage, also, noted, that, ayiti, or, ha, ti, was, the, easternmost, province, of, the, island, an, area, in, the, dominican, republic, called, los, haitises, national, park, on, the, other, hand, oviedo, and, las, casas, both, recorded, that, the, entire, island, was, called, ayiti, by, the, ta, no, when, columbus, took, possession, of, the, island, in, 1492, he, named, it, insula, hispana, in, latin, and, la, isla, espa, ola, in, spanish, both, meaning, the, spanish, island, las, casas, shortened, the, name, to, espa, ola, and, when, peter, martyr, detailed, his, account, of, the, island, in, latin, he, rendered, its, name, as, hispaniola, due, to, ta, no, spanish, and, french, influences, on, the, island, historically, the, whole, island, was, often, referred, to, as, ha, ti, hayti, santo, domingo, or, saint, domingue, martyr, s, literary, work, was, translated, into, english, and, french, soon, after, being, written, the, name, hispaniola, became, the, most, frequently, used, term, in, english, speaking, countries, for, the, island, in, scientific, and, cartographic, works, in, 1918, the, united, states, occupation, government, led, by, harry, shepard, knapp, obliged, the, use, of, the, name, hispaniola, on, the, island, and, recommended, the, use, of, that, name, to, the, national, geographic, society, the, name, ha, ti, was, adopted, by, haitian, revolutionary, jean, jacques, dessalines, in, 1804, as, the, official, name, of, independent, saint, domingue, in, tribute, to, the, amerindian, predecessors, it, was, also, adopted, as, the, official, name, of, independent, santo, domingo, as, the, republic, of, spanish, haiti, a, state, that, existed, from, november, 1821, until, its, annexation, by, haiti, in,

hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, during, the, 1st, millennium, bc, the, arawakan, speaking, ancestors, of, the, taino, people, began, to, migrate, into, the, caribbean, unlike, the, archaic, peoples, they, practiced, the, intensive, production, of, pottery, and, agriculture, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, ancestors, of, the, taino, people, on, hispaniola, is, the, ostionoid, culture, which, dates, to, around, 600, ad, the, taino, represented, the, dominant, group, on, the, island, during, the, period, of, european, contact, each, society, on, the, island, was, a, small, independent, kingdom, with, a, lead, known, as, a, cacique, in, 1492, which, is, considered, the, peak, of, the, ta, no, there, were, five, different, kingdoms, on, the, island, the, xaragua, higuey, caizcimu, magua, huhabo, ciguayos, cayabo, or, maguana, and, marien, bainoa, many, distinct, ta, no, languages, also, existed, in, this, time, period, there, is, still, heated, debate, over, the, population, of, ta, no, people, on, the, island, of, hispaniola, in, 1492, but, estimates, range, from, no, more, than, a, few, tens, of, thousands, according, to, a, 2020, genetic, analysis, to, upwards, of, 750, 000, a, ta, no, home, consisted, of, a, circular, building, with, woven, straw, and, palm, leaves, as, covering, most, individuals, slept, in, fashioned, hammocks, but, grass, beds, were, also, used, the, cacique, lived, in, a, different, structure, with, larger, rectangular, walls, and, a, porch, the, ta, no, village, also, had, a, flat, court, used, for, ball, games, and, festivals, religiously, the, ta, no, people, were, polytheists, and, their, gods, were, called, zem, religious, worship, and, dancing, were, common, and, medicine, men, or, priests, also, consulted, the, zem,

and, birds, in, lakes, and, in, the, sea, they, were, able, to, catch, ducks, and, turtles, the, ta, no, also, relied, on, agriculture, as, a, primary, food, source, the, indigenous, people, of, hispaniola, raised, crops, in, a, conuco, which, is, a, large, mound, packed, with, leaves, and, fixed, crops, to, prevent, erosion, some, common, agricultural, goods, were, cassava, maize, squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, cotton, and, tobacco, which, was, used, as, an, aspect, of, social, life, and, religious, ceremonies, the, ta, no, people, traveled, often, and, used, hollowed, canoes, with, paddles, when, on, the, water, for, fishing, or, for, migration, purposes, and, upwards, of, 100, people, could, fit, into, a, single, canoe, the, ta, no, came, frequently, in, contact, with, the, caribs, another, indigenous, tribe, the, ta, no, people, had, to, defend, themselves, using, bows, and, arrows, with, poisoned, tips, and, some, war, clubs, when, columbus, landed, on, hispaniola, many, ta, no, leaders, wanted, protection, from, the, caribs, christopher, columbus, first, landed, at, hispaniola, on, december, 6, 1492, at, a, small, bay, he, named, san, nicolas, now, called, m, le, saint, nicolas, on, the, north, coast, of, present, day, haiti, he, was, welcomed, in, a, friendly, fashion, by, the, indigenous, people, known, as, the, ta, no, trading, with, the, natives, yielded, more, gold, than, they, had, come, across, previously, on, the, other, caribbean, islands, and, columbus, was, led, to, believe, that, much, more, gold, would, be, found, inland, before, he, could, explore, further, his, flagship, the, santa, maria, ran, aground, and, sank, in, the, bay, on, december, 24, with, only, two, smaller, ships, remaining, for, the, voyage, home, columbus, built, a, fortified, encampment, la, navidad, on, the, shore, and, left, behind, 21, crewman, to, await, his, return, the, following, year, colonization, began, in, earnest, the, following, year, when, columbus, brought, 1, 300, men, to, hispaniola, in, november, 1493, with, the, intention, of, establishing, a, permanent, settlement, they, found, the, encampment, at, navidad, had, been, destroyed, and, all, the, crewmen, left, behind, killed, by, the, natives, columbus, decided, to, sail, east, in, search, of, a, better, site, to, found, a, new, settlement, in, january, 1494, they, established, la, isabela, in, present, day, dominican, republic, in, 1496, the, town, of, nueva, isabela, was, founded, after, being, destroyed, by, a, hurricane, it, was, rebuilt, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, ozama, river, and, called, santo, domingo, it, is, the, oldest, permanent, european, settlement, in, the, americas, the, island, had, an, important, role, in, the, establishment, of, latin, american, colonies, for, decades, to, come, due, to, its, strategic, location, it, was, the, military, stronghold, of, conquistadors, of, the, spanish, empire, serving, as, a, headquarters, for, the, further, colonial, expansion, into, the, americas, the, colony, was, a, meeting, point, of, european, explorers, soldiers, and, settlers, who, brought, with, them, the, culture, architecture, laws, and, traditions, of, the, old, world, spaniards, imposed, a, harsh, regime, of, forced, labor, and, enslavement, of, the, ta, nos, as, well, as, redirection, of, their, food, production, and, labor, to, spaniards, this, had, a, devastating, impact, on, both, mortality, and, fertility, of, the, ta, no, population, over, the, first, quarter, century, colonial, administrators, and, dominican, and, hieronymite, friars, observed, that, the, search, for, gold, and, agrarian, enslavement, through, the, encomienda, system, were, deciminating, the, indigenous, population, demographic, data, from, two, provinces, in, 1514, shows, a, low, birth, rate, consistent, with, a, 3, 5, annual, population, decline, in, 1503, spaniards, began, to, bring, enslaved, africans, after, a, charter, was, passed, in, 1501, allowing, the, import, of, african, slaves, by, ferdinand, and, isabel, the, spanish, believed, africans, would, be, more, capable, of, performing, physical, labor, from, 1519, to, 1533, the, indigenous, uprising, known, as, enriquillo, s, revolt, after, the, ta, no, cacique, who, led, them, ensued, resulting, from, escaped, african, slaves, on, the, island, maroons, possibly, working, with, the, ta, no, people, precious, metals, played, a, large, role, in, the, history, of, the, island, after, columbus, s, arrival, one, of, the, first, inhabitants, columbus, came, across, on, this, island, was, a, girl, wearing, only, a, gold, nose, plug, soon, the, ta, nos, were, trading, pieces, of, gold, for, hawk, s, bells, with, their, cacique, declaring, the, gold, came, from, cibao, traveling, further, east, from, navidad, columbus, came, across, the, yaque, del, norte, river, which, he, named, r, o, de, oro, river, of, gold, because, its, sands, abound, in, gold, dust, on, columbus, s, return, during, his, second, voyage, he, learned, it, was, the, chief, caonabo, who, had, massacred, his, settlement, at, navidad, while, columbus, established, a, new, settlement, the, village, of, la, isabela, on, jan, 1494, he, sent, alonso, de, ojeda, and, 15, men, to, search, for, the, mines, of, cibao, after, a, six, day, journey, ojeda, came, across, an, area, containing, gold, in, which, the, gold, was, extracted, from, streams, by, the, ta, no, people, columbus, himself, visited, the, mines, of, cibao, on, 12, march, 1494, he, constructed, the, fort, of, santo, tom, s, present, day, j, nico, leaving, captain, pedro, margarit, in, command, of, 56, men, 119, 122, 126, on, 24, march, 1495, columbus, with, his, ally, guacanagarix, embarked, on, a, war, of, revenge, against, caonabo, capturing, him, and, his, family, while, killing, many, indians, and, capturing, others, afterwards, every, person, of, fourteen, years, of, age, or, upward, was, to, pay, a, large, hawk, s, bell, of, gold, dust, every, three, months, as, the, spaniards, were, sure, there, was, more, gold, in, the, island, than, the, natives, had, yet, found, and, were, determined, to, make, them, dig, it, out, 149, 150, gold, mining, using, forced, indigenous, labor, began, early, on, hispaniola, miguel, d, az, and, francisco, de, garay, discovered, large, gold, nuggets, on, the, lower, haina, river, in, 1496, these, san, cristobal, mines, were, later, known, as, the, minas, viejas, mines, then, in, 1499, the, first, major, discovery, of, gold, was, made, in, the, cordillera, central, which, led, to, a, mining, boom, by, 1501, columbus, s, cousin, giovanni, colombo, had, discovered, gold, near, buenaventura, the, deposits, were, later, known, as, minas, nuevas, two, major, mining, areas, resulted, one, along, san, cristobal, buenaventura, and, another, in, cibao, within, the, la, vega, cotuy, bonao, triangle, while, santiago, de, los, caballeros, concepci, n, and, bonao, became, mining, towns, the, gold, rush, of, 1500, 1508, ensued, and, ovando, expropriated, the, gold, mines, of, miguel, d, az, and, francisco, de, garay, in, 1504, as, pit, mines, became, royal, mines, for, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, who, reserved, the, best, mines, for, himself, though, placers, were, open, to, private, prospectors, king, ferdinand, kept, 967, natives, in, the, san, crist, bal, mining, area, supervised, by, salaried, miners, 68, 71, 78, 125, 127, under, the, royal, governor, nicol, s, de, ovando, the, indigenous, people, were, forced, to, work, in, the, gold, mines, by, 1503, the, spanish, crown, legalized, the, allocation, of, private, grants, of, indigenous, labor, to, particular, spaniards, for, mining, through, the, encomienda, system, once, the, indigenous, were, forced, into, mining, far, from, their, home, villages, they, suffered, hunger, and, other, difficult, conditions, by, 1508, the, ta, no, population, of, about, 400, 000, was, reduced, to, 60, 000, and, by, 1514, only, 26, 334, remained, about, half, resided, in, the, mining, towns, of, concepci, n, santiago, santo, domingo, and, buenaventura, the, repartimiento, of, 1514, accelerated, emigration, of, the, spanish, colonists, coupled, with, the, exhaustion, of, the, mines, 191, 192, the, first, documented, outbreak, of, smallpox, previously, an, eastern, hemisphere, disease, occurred, on, hispaniola, in, december, 1518, among, enslaved, african, miners, some, scholars, speculate, that, european, diseases, arrived, before, this, date, but, there, is, no, compelling, evidence, for, an, outbreak, the, natives, had, no, acquired, immunity, to, european, diseases, including, smallpox, by, may, 1519, as, many, as, one, third, of, the, remaining, ta, nos, had, died, in, the, century, following, the, spanish, arrival, on, hispaniola, the, ta, no, population, fell, by, up, to, 95, of, the, population, out, of, a, pre, contact, population, estimated, from, tens, of, thousands, to, 8, 000, 000, many, authors, have, described, the, treatment, of, tainos, in, hispaniola, under, the, spanish, empire, as, genocide, sugar, cane, was, introduced, to, hispaniola, by, settlers, from, the, canary, islands, and, the, first, sugar, mill, in, the, new, world, was, established, in, 1516, on, hispaniola, the, need, for, a, labor, force, to, meet, the, growing, demands, of, sugar, cane, cultivation, led, to, an, exponential, increase, in, the, importation, of, slaves, over, the, following, two, decades, the, sugar, mill, owners, soon, formed, a, new, colonial, elite, the, first, major, slave, revolt, in, the, americas, occurred, in, santo, domingo, during, 1521, when, enslaved, muslims, of, the, wolof, nation, led, an, uprising, in, the, sugar, plantation, of, admiral, don, diego, colon, son, of, christopher, columbus, many, of, these, insurgents, managed, to, escape, where, they, formed, independent, maroon, communities, in, the, south, of, the, island, beginning, in, the, 1520s, the, caribbean, sea, was, raided, by, increasingly, numerous, french, pirates, in, 1541, spain, authorized, the, construction, of, santo, domingo, s, fortified, wall, and, in, 1560, decided, to, restrict, sea, travel, to, enormous, well, armed, convoys, in, another, move, which, would, destroy, hispaniola, s, sugar, industry, in, 1561, havana, more, strategically, located, in, relation, to, the, gulf, stream, was, selected, as, the, designated, stopping, point, for, the, merchant, flotas, which, had, a, royal, monopoly, on, commerce, with, the, americas, in, 1564, the, island, s, main, inland, cities, santiago, de, los, caballeros, and, concepci, n, de, la, vega, were, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, in, the, 1560s, english, privateers, joined, the, french, in, regularly, raiding, spanish, shipping, in, the, americas, by, the, early, 17th, century, hispaniola, and, its, nearby, islands, notably, tortuga, became, regular, stopping, points, for, caribbean, pirates, in, 1606, the, government, of, philip, iii, ordered, all, inhabitants, of, hispaniola, to, move, close, to, santo, domingo, to, fight, against, piracy, rather, than, secure, the, island, his, action, meant, that, french, english, and, dutch, pirates, established, their, own, bases, on, the, less, populated, north, and, west, coasts, of, the, island, in, 1625, french, and, english, pirates, arrived, on, the, island, of, tortuga, just, off, the, northwest, coast, of, hispaniola, which, was, originally, settled, by, a, few, spanish, colonists, the, pirates, were, attacked, in, 1629, by, spanish, forces, commanded, by, don, fadrique, de, toledo, who, fortified, the, island, and, expelled, the, french, and, english, as, most, of, the, spanish, army, left, for, the, main, island, of, hispaniola, to, root, out, french, colonists, there, the, french, returned, to, tortuga, in, 1630, and, had, constant, battles, for, several, decades, in, 1654, the, spanish, re, captured, tortuga, for, the, last, time, in, 1655, the, island, of, tortuga, was, reoccupied, by, the, english, and, french, in, 1660, the, english, appointed, a, frenchman, as, governor, who, proclaimed, the, king, of, france, set, up, french, colours, and, defeated, several, english, attempts, to, reclaim, the, island, in, 1665, french, colonization, of, the, island, was, officially, recognized, by, king, louis, xiv, the, french, colony, was, given, the, name, saint, domingue, by, 1670, a, welsh, privateer, named, henry, morgan, invited, the, pirates, on, the, island, of, tortuga, to, set, sail, under, him, they, were, hired, by, the, french, as, a, striking, force, that, allowed, france, to, have, a, much, stronger, hold, on, the, caribbean, region, consequently, the, pirates, never, really, controlled, the, island, and, kept, tortuga, as, a, neutral, hideout, the, capital, of, the, french, colony, of, saint, domingue, was, moved, from, tortuga, to, port, de, paix, on, the, mainland, of, hispaniola, in, 1676, in, 1680, new, acts, of, parliament, forbade, sailing, under, foreign, flags, in, opposition, to, former, practice, this, was, a, major, legal, blow, to, the, caribbean, pirates, settlements, were, made, in, the, treaty, of, ratisbon, of, 1684, signed, by, the, european, powers, that, put, an, end, to, piracy, most, of, the, pirates, after, this, time, were, hired, out, into, the, royal, services, to, suppress, their, former, buccaneer, allies, in, the, 1697, treaty, of, ryswick, spain, formally, ceded, the, western, third, of, the, island, to, france, saint, domingue, quickly, came, to, overshadow, the, east, in, both, wealth, and, population, nicknamed, the, pearl, of, the, antilles, it, became, the, most, prosperous, colony, in, the, west, indies, with, a, system, of, human, slavery, used, to, grow, and, harvest, sugar, cane, during, a, time, when, european, demand, for, sugar, was, high, slavery, kept, costs, low, and, profit, was, maximized, it, was, an, important, port, in, the, americas, for, goods, and, products, flowing, to, and, from, france, and, europe, european, colonists, often, died, young, due, to, tropical, fevers, as, well, as, from, violent, slave, resistance, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, in, 1791, during, the, french, revolution, a, major, slave, revolt, broke, out, on, saint, domingue, when, the, french, republic, abolished, slavery, in, the, colonies, on, february, 4, 1794, it, was, a, european, first, the, ex, slave, army, joined, forces, with, france, in, its, war, against, its, european, neighbors, in, the, second, 1795, treaty, of, basel, july, 22, spain, ceded, the, eastern, two, thirds, of, the, island, of, hispaniola, later, to, become, the, dominican, republic, french, settlers, had, begun, to, colonize, some, areas, in, the, spanish, side, of, the, territory, under, napoleon, france, reimposed, slavery, in, most, of, its, caribbean, islands, in, 1802, and, sent, an, army, to, bring, the, island, into, full, control, however, thousands, of, the, french, troops, succumbed, to, yellow, fever, during, the, summer, months, and, more, than, half, of, the, french, army, died, because, of, disease, after, an, extremely, brutal, war, with, atrocities, committed, on, both, sides, the, french, removed, the, surviving, 7, 000, troops, in, late, 1803, the, leaders, of, the, revolution, declared, western, hispaniola, the, new, nation, of, independent, haiti, in, early, 1804, france, continued, to, rule, spanish, santo, domingo, in, 1805, haitian, troops, of, general, henri, christophe, tried, to, conquer, all, of, hispaniola, they, invaded, santo, domingo, and, sacked, the, towns, of, santiago, de, los, caballeros, and, moca, killing, most, of, their, residents, but, news, of, a, french, fleet, sailing, towards, haiti, forced, general, christophe, to, withdraw, from, the, east, leaving, it, in, french, hands, in, 1808, following, napoleon, s, invasion, of, spain, the, criollos, of, santo, domingo, revolted, against, french, rule, and, with, the, aid, of, the, united, kingdom, returned, santo, domingo, to, spanish, control, fearing, the, influence, of, a, society, of, slaves, that, had, successfully, revolted, against, their, owners, the, united, states, and, european, powers, refused, to, recognize, haiti, the, second, republic, in, the, western, hemisphere, france, demanded, a, high, payment, for, compensation, to, slaveholders, who, lost, their, property, and, haiti, was, saddled, with, unmanageable, debt, for, decades, haiti, would, annex, spanish, haiti, which, had, recently, gained, independence, however, suppression, of, the, dominican, culture, would, lead, to, the, dominican, war, of, independence, this, is, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, tensions, between, the, two, countries, today, haiti, would, become, one, of, the, poorest, countries, in, the, americas, while, the, dominican, republic, gradually, has, developed, into, one, of, the, largest, economies, of, central, america, and, the, caribbean, hispaniola, is, the, second, largest, island, in, the, caribbean, after, cuba, with, an, area, of, 76, 192, square, kilometers, 29, 418, sq, mi, 48, 440, square, kilometers, 18, 700, sq, mi, of, which, is, under, the, sovereignty, of, the, dominican, republic, occupying, the, eastern, portion, and, 27,

of, the, dominican, republic, into, northwestern, haiti, where, it, is, known, as, the, massif, du, nord, this, mountain, range, boasts, the, highest, peak, in, the, antilles, pico, duarte, at, 3, 101, meters, 10, 174, ft, above, sea, level, the, cordillera, septentrional, runs, parallel, to, the, central, range, across, the, northern, end, of, the, dominican, republic, extending, into, the, atlantic, ocean, as, the, saman, peninsula, the, cordillera, central, and, cordillera, septentrional, are, separated, by, the, lowlands, of, the, cibao, valley, and, the, atlantic, coastal, plains, which, extend, westward, into, haiti, as, the, plaine, du, nord, northern, plain, the, lowest, of, the, ranges, is, the, cordillera, oriental, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, country, the, sierra, de, neiba, rises, in, the, southwest, of, the, dominican, republic, and, continues, northwest, into, haiti, parallel, to, the, cordillera, central, as, the, montagnes, noires, cha, ne, des, matheux, and, the, montagnes, du, trou, d, eau, the, plateau, central, lies, between, the, massif, du, nord, and, the, montagnes, noires, and, the, plaine, de, l, artibonite, lies, between, the, montagnes, noires, and, the, cha, ne, des, matheux, opening, westward, toward, the, gulf, of, gon, ve, the, largest, gulf, of, the, antilles, the, southern, range, begins, in, the, southwesternmost, dominican, republic, as, the, sierra, de, bahoruco, and, extends, west, into, haiti, as, the, massif, de, la, selle, and, the, massif, de, la, hotte, which, form, the, mountainous, spine, of, haiti, s, southern, peninsula, pic, de, la, selle, is, the, highest, peak, in, the, southern, range, the, third, highest, peak, in, the, antilles, and, consequently, the, highest, point, in, haiti, at, 2, 680, meters, 8, 790, ft, above, sea, level, a, depression, runs, parallel, to, the, southern, range, between, the, southern, range, and, the, cha, ne, des, matheux, sierra, de, neiba, it, is, known, as, the, plaine, du, cul, de, sac, in, haiti, and, haiti, s, capital, port, au, prince, lies, at, its, western, end, the, depression, is, home, to, a, chain, of, salt, lakes, including, lake, azuei, in, haiti, and, lake, enriquillo, in, the, dominican, republic, the, island, has, four, distinct, ecoregions, the, hispaniolan, moist, forests, ecoregion, covers, approximately, 50, of, the, island, especially, the, northern, and, eastern, portions, predominantly, in, the, lowlands, but, extending, up, to, 2, 100, meters, 6, 900, ft, elevation, the, hispaniolan, dry, forests, ecoregion, occupies, approximately, 20, of, the, island, lying, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, mountains, in, the, southern, and, western, portion, of, the, island, and, in, the, cibao, valley, in, the, center, north, of, the, island, the, hispaniolan, pine, forests, occupy, the, mountainous, 15, of, the, island, above, 850, metres, 2, 790, ft, elevation, the, flooded, grasslands, and, savannas, ecoregion, in, the, south, central, region, of, the, island, surrounds, a, chain, of, lakes, and, lagoons, in, which, the, most, notable, include, that, of, lake, azuei, and, trou, ca, man, in, haiti, and, the, nearby, lake, enriquillo, in, the, dominican, republic, which, is, not, only, the, lowest, point, of, the, island, but, also, the, lowest, point, for, an, island, country, hispaniola, s, climate, shows, considerable, variation, due, to, its, diverse, mountainous, topography, and, is, the, most, varied, island, of, all, the, antilles, except, in, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, season, the, predominant, winds, over, hispaniola, are, the, northeast, trade, winds, as, in, jamaica, and, cuba, these, winds, deposit, their, moisture, on, the, northern, mountains, and, create, a, distinct, rain, shadow, on, the, southern, coast, where, some, areas, receive, as, little, as, 400, millimetres, 16, in, of, rainfall, and, have, semi, arid, climates, annual, rainfall, under, 600, millimetres, 24, in, also, occurs, on, the, southern, coast, of, haiti, s, northwest, peninsula, and, in, the, central, az, a, region, of, the, plaine, du, cul, de, sac, in, these, regions, moreover, there, is, generally, little, rainfall, outside, hurricane, season, from, august, to, october, and, droughts, are, by, no, means, uncommon, when, hurricanes, do, not, come, on, the, northern, coast, in, contrast, rainfall, may, peak, between, december, and, february, though, some, rain, falls, in, all, months, of, the, year, annual, amounts, typically, range, from, 1, 700, to, 2, 000, millimetres, 67, to, 79, in, on, the, northern, coastal, lowlands, there, is, probably, much, more, in, the, cordillera, septentrional, though, no, data, exist, the, interior, of, hispaniola, along, with, the, southeastern, coast, centered, around, santo, domingo, typically, receives, around, 1, 400, millimetres, 55, in, per, year, with, a, distinct, season, from, may, to, october, usually, this, wet, season, has, two, peaks, one, around, may, the, other, around, the, hurricane, season, in, the, interior, highlands, rainfall, is, much, greater, around, 3, 100, millimetres, 120, in, per, year, but, with, a, similar, pattern, to, that, observed, in, the, central, lowlands, the, variations, of, temperature, depend, on, altitude, and, are, much, less, marked, than, rainfall, variations, in, the, island, lowland, hispaniola, is, generally, more, hot, and, humid, with, temperatures, averaging, 28, c, 82, f, with, high, humidity, during, the, daytime, and, around, 20, c, 68, f, at, night, at, higher, altitudes, temperatures, fall, steadily, so, that, frosts, occur, during, the, dry, season, on, the, highest, peaks, where, maxima, are, no, higher, than, 18, c, 64, f, there, are, many, bird, species, in, hispaniola, and, the, island, s, amphibian, species, are, also, diverse, there, are, many, species, endemic, to, the, island, including, insects, and, other, invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, fishs, birds, and, mammals, originally, animals, native, animals, and, also, imported, animals, introduced, animals, not, native, animals, or, invasive, species, just, like, farm, animals, transport, animals, house, animals, pets, and, more, the, two, endemic, terrestrial, mammals, on, the, island, are, the, hispaniolan, hutia, plagiodontia, aedium, and, the, hispaniolan, solenodon, solenodon, paradoxus, there, are, also, many, avian, species, on, the, island, with, six, endemic, genera, calyptophilus, dulus, nesoctites, phaenicophilus, xenoligea, and, microligea, more, than, half, of, the, original, distribution, of, its, ecoregions, has, been, lost, due, to, habitat, destruction, impacting, the, local, fauna, and, some, of, the, original, animals, either, threat, threatened, with, extinction, or, totally, extinct, because, of, climate, change, or, because, they, have, been, hunted, by, humans, or, their, habitats, have, been, felled, or, changed, for, some, reasons, or, have, become, some, of, the, animals, have, been, threatened, by, introduced, animals, not, native, animals, or, invasive, species, or, there, are, fighting, for, space, to, survive, and, perhaps, some, animals, that, feed, on, the, same, plants, or, animals, or, just, something, like, that, the, island, has, four, distinct, ecoregions, the, hispaniolan, moist, forests, ecoregion, covers, approximately, 50, of, the, island, especially, the, northern, and, eastern, portions, predominantly, in, the, lowlands, but, extending, up, to, 2, 100, meters, 6, 900, ft, elevation, the, hispaniolan, dry, forests, ecoregion, occupies, approximately, 20, of, the, island, lying, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, mountains, in, the, southern, and, western, portion, of, the, island, and, in, the, cibao, valley, in, the, center, north, of, the, island, the, hispaniolan, pine, forests, occupy, the, mountainous, 15, of, the, island, above, 850, metres, 2, 790, ft, elevation, the, flooded, grasslands, and, savannas, ecoregion, in, the, south, central, region, of, the, island, surrounds, a, chain, of, lakes, and, lagoons, the, most, notable, of, which, are, etang, saumatre, and, trou, ca, man, in, haiti, and, the, nearby, lake, enriquillo, in, the, dominican, republic, in, haiti, deforestation, has, long, been, cited, by, scientists, as, a, source, of, ecological, crisis, the, timber, industry, dates, back, to, french, colonial, rule, haiti, has, seen, a, dramatic, reduction, of, forests, due, to, the, excessive, and, increasing, use, of, charcoal, as, fuel, for, cooking, various, media, outlets, have, suggested, that, the, country, has, just, 2, forest, cover, but, this, has, not, been, substantiated, by, research, also, extremely, important, are, the, rarely, mentioned, species, of, pinguicula, casabitoana, a, carnivorous, plant, gonocalyx, tetraptera, gesneria, sylvicola, lyonia, alaini, and, myrcia, saliana, as, well, as, palo, de, viento, didymopanax, tremulus, jaiqui, bumelia, salicifolia, pino, criciolio, pino, criciol, sangre, de, pollo, mecranium, amigdalinum, and, palo, santo, alpinia, speciosa, according, to, reports, in, the, dominican, republic, and, haiti, the, flora, in, this, naturally, protected, area, consists, of, 621, species, of, vascular, plants, of, which, 153, are, highly, endemic, to, la, hispaniola, the, most, prominent, endemic, species, of, flora, that, abound, in, the, area, are, ebano, verde, green, ebony, magnolia, pallescens, a, highly, endangered, hardwood, recent, in, depth, studies, of, satellite, imagery, and, environmental, analysis, regarding, forest, classification, conclude, that, haiti, actually, has, approximately, 30, tree, cover, this, is, nevertheless, a, stark, decrease, from, the, country, s, 60, forest, cover, in, 1925, the, country, has, been, significantly, deforested, over, the, last, 50, years, resulting, in, the, desertification, of, many, portions, of, haitian, territory, haiti, s, poor, citizens, use, cooking, fires, often, and, this, is, a, major, culprit, behind, the, nation, s, loss, of, trees, haitians, use, trees, as, fuel, either, by, burning, the, wood, directly, or, by, first, turning, it, into, charcoal, in, ovens, seventy, one, percent, of, all, fuel, consumed, in, haiti, is, wood, or, charcoal, haiti, s, government, began, establishing, protected, areas, across, the, country, in, 1968, these, 26, areas, today, represent, nearly, 7, per, cent, of, the, country, s, land, and, 1, 5, per, cent, of, its, waters, in, the, dominican, republic, the, forest, cover, has, increased, in, 2003, the, dominican, republic, s, forest, cover, had, been, reduced, to, 32, of, its, land, area, but, by, 2011, forest, cover, had, increased, to, nearly, 40, the, success, of, the, dominican, forest, growth, is, due, to, several, dominican, government, policies, and, private, organizations, for, the, purpose, of, reforesting, and, a, strong, educational, campaign, that, has, resulted, in, increased, awareness, by, the, dominican, people, of, the, importance, of, forests, for, their, welfare, and, other, forms, of, life, on, the, island, hispaniola, is, the, most, populous, caribbean, island, with, a, combined, population, of, 23, million, inhabitants, as, of, july, 2023, the, dominican, republic, is, a, hispanophone, nation, of, approximately, 11, 3, million, people, spanish, is, spoken, by, essentially, all, dominicans, as, a, primary, language, roman, catholicism, is, the, official, and, dominant, religion, and, some, evangelicalism, and, protestant, churches, and, the, church, of, jesus, christ, and, minority, religions, such, as, african, religions, afro, american, religions, african, diaspora, religions,

jehovah, s, witnesses, pentecostalism, and, others, also, exist, haiti, is, a, creole, speaking, nation, of, roughly, 11, 7, million, people, although, french, is, spoken, as, a, primary, language, by, the, educated, and, wealthy, minority, virtually, the, entire, population, speaks, haitian, creole, one, of, several, french, derived, creole, languages, roman, catholicism, is, the, dominant, religion, practiced, by, more, than, half, the, population, although, in, some, cases, in, combination, with, haitian, vodou, faith, another, 25, of, the, populace, belong, to, protestant, churches, the, ethnic, composition, of, the, dominican, population, is, 73, mixed, ethnicity, 16, white, and, 11, black, descendants, of, early, spanish, settlers, and, of, black, slaves, from, west, africa, constitute, the, two, main, racial, strains, the, ethnic, composition, of, haiti, is, estimated, to, be, 95, black, and, 5, white, and, mulatto, in, recent, times, dominican, and, puerto, rican, researchers, identified, in, the, current, dominican, population, the, presence, of, genes, belonging, to, the, aborigines, of, the, canary, islands, commonly, called, guanches, these, genes, also, have, been, detected, in, puerto, rico, the, island, has, the, largest, economy, in, the, greater, antilles, however, most, of, the, economic, development, is, found, in, the, dominican, republic, the, dominican, economy, being, nearly, 800, larger, than, the, haitian, economy, as, of, 2018, the, estimated, annual, per, capita, income, is, us, 868, in, haiti, and, us, 8, 050, in, the, dominican, republic, the, divergence, between, the, level, of, economic, development, in, haiti, and, the, dominican, republic, makes, its, border, the, highest, contrast, of, all, western, land, borders, the, island, also, has, an, economic, history, and, current, day, interest, and, involvement, in, precious, metals, in, 1860, it, was, observed, that, the, island, contained, a, large, supply, of, gold, which, the, early, spaniards, had, hardly, developed, by, 1919, condit, and, ross, noted, that, much, of, the, island, was, covered, by, government, granted, concessions, for, mining, different, types, of, minerals, besides, gold, these, minerals, included, silver, manganese, copper, magnetite, iron, and, nickel, mining, operations, in, 2016, have, taken, advantage, of, the, volcanogenic, massive, sulfide, ore, deposits, around, maim, n, to, the, northeast, the, pueblo, viejo, gold, mine, was, operated, by, state, owned, rosario, dominicana, from, 1975, until, 1991, in, 2009, pueblo, viejo, dominicana, corporation, formed, by, barrick, gold, and, goldcorp, started, open, pit, mining, operations, of, the, monte, negro, and, moore, oxide, deposits, the, mined, ore, is, processed, with, gold, cyanidation, pyrite, and, sphalerite, are, the, main, sulfide, minerals, found, in, the, 120, meter, thick, volcanic, conglomerates, and, agglomerates, which, constitute, the, world, s, second, largest, sulphidation, gold, deposit, between, bonao, and, maim, n, falconbridge, dominicana, has, been, mining, nickel, laterites, since, 1971, the, cerro, de, maimon, copper, gold, open, pit, mine, southeast, of, maim, n, has, been, operated, by, perilya, since, 2006, copper, is, extracted, from, the, sulfide, ores, while, gold, and, silver, are, extracted, from, both, the, sulfide, and, the, oxide, ores, processing, is, via, froth, flotation, and, cyanidation, the, ore, is, located, in, the, vms, early, cretaceous, maim, n, formation, goethite, enriched, with, gold, and, silver, is, found, in, the, 30, meter, thick, oxide, cap, below, that, cap, is, a, supergene, zone, containing, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and, sphalerite, below, the, supergene, zone, is, found, the, unaltered, massive, sulphide, mineralization, this, is, a, list, of, dominican, republic, and, haiti, regions, by, human, development, index, as, of, 2018
