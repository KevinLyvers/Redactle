the, bosporus, or, bosphorus, strait, b, s, p, r, s, b, s, f, r, s, boss, p, r, s, boss, f, r, s, turkish, stanbul, bo, az, lit, istanbul, strait, colloquially, bo, az, is, a, natural, strait, and, an, internationally, significant, waterway, located, in, istanbul, turkey, the, bosporus, connects, the, black, sea, to, the, sea, of, marmara, and, forms, one, of, the, continental, boundaries, between, asia, and, europe, it, also, divides, turkey, by, separating, asia, minor, from, thrace, it, is, the, world, s, narrowest, strait, used, for, international, navigation, most, of, the, shores, of, the, bosporus, strait, except, for, the, area, to, the, north, are, heavily, settled, with, the, city, of, istanbul, s, metropolitan, population, of, 17, million, inhabitants, extending, inland, from, both, banks, the, bosporus, strait, and, the, dardanelles, strait, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, sea, of, marmara, are, together, known, as, the, turkish, straits, sections, of, the, shore, of, the, bosporus, in, istanbul, have, been, reinforced, with, concrete, or, rubble, and, those, sections, of, the, strait, prone, to, deposition, are, periodically, dredged, the, name, of, the, strait, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, b, sporos, which, was, folk, etymologised, as, i, e, cattle, strait, like, ox, ford, from, the, genitive, of, bo, s, ox, cattle, poros, passage, thus, meaning, cattle, passage, or, cow, passage, this, is, a, reference, to, the, greek, mythological, story, of, io, who, was, transformed, into, a, cow, and, condemned, to, wander, the, earth, until, she, crossed, the, bosporus, where, she, met, the, titan, prometheus, who, comforted, her, by, telling, her, that, she, would, be, restored, to, human, form, by, zeus, and, become, the, ancestor, of, the, greatest, of, all, heroes, heracles, hercules, io, supposedly, went, ashore, near, chrysopolis, present, day, sk, dar, which, was, named, bous, the, cow, the, same, site, was, also, known, as, damalis, as, it, was, where, the, athenian, general, chares, had, erected, a, monument, to, his, wife, damalis, which, included, a, colossal, statue, of, a, cow, the, name, translating, to, heifer, the, english, spelling, with, ph, bosphor, is, not, justified, by, the, ancient, greek, name, and, dictionaries, prefer, the, spelling, with, p, however, ph, occurs, as, a, variant, in, medieval, latin, as, bosphor, and, occasionally, bosphorus, or, bospherus, and, in, medieval, greek, sometimes, as, giving, rise, to, the, french, bosphore, the, spanish, b, sforo, the, italian, bosforo, and, the, russian, the, 12th, century, greek, scholar, john, tzetzes, calls, it, damaliten, bosporon, after, damalis, but, he, also, reports, that, in, popular, usage, the, strait, was, known, as, prosphorion, during, his, day, the, name, of, the, most, ancient, northern, harbour, of, constantinople, in, english, the, preferred, spelling, tends, to, be, bosphorus, historically, the, bosporus, was, also, known, as, the, strait, of, constantinople, or, the, thracian, bosporus, to, distinguish, it, from, the, cimmerian, bosporus, in, crimea, these, are, expressed, in, herodotus, s, histories, 4, 83, as, bosporus, thracius, bosporus, thraciae, and, b, sporos, thr, ikios, respectively, other, names, used, by, herodotus, to, refer, to, the, strait, include, chalcedonian, bosporus, bosporus, chalcedoniae, herodotus, 4, 87, or, mysian, bosporus, bosporus, mysius, the, term, eventually, came, to, be, used, as, the, common, noun, meaning, a, strait, and, was, also, formerly, applied, to, the, hellespont, in, classical, greek, by, aeschylus, and, sophocles, as, a, maritime, waterway, the, bosporus, connects, the, black, sea, to, the, sea, of, marmara, and, thence, to, the, aegean, and, mediterranean, seas, via, the, dardanelles, it, also, connects, various, seas, along, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, balkans, the, near, east, and, western, eurasia, thus, the, bosporus, allows, maritime, connections, from, the, black, sea, all, the, way, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, via, gibraltar, and, to, the, indian, ocean, through, the, suez, canal, making, it, a, crucial, international, waterway, in, particular, for, the, passage, of, goods, coming, from, russia, there, is, one, very, small, island, in, the, bosporus, just, off, kuru, e, me, now, generally, known, as, galatasaray, island, galatasaray, adas, this, was, given, to, the, armenian, architect, sarkis, balyan, by, sultan, abd, lhamid, ii, in, 1880, the, house, he, built, on, it, was, later, demolished, the, island, became, a, walled, garden, and, then, a, water, sports, centre, before, it, was, given, to, the, galatasaray, sports, club, hence, its, name, however, in, the, 2010s, it, was, completely, overbuilt, with, nightclubs, in, another, change, the, government, had, these, torn, down, in, 2017, it, reopened, to, the, public, in, the, summer, of, 2022, the, exact, cause, and, date, of, the, formation, of, the, bosporus, remain, a, subject, of, debate, among, geologists, one, recent, hypothesis, dubbed, the, black, sea, deluge, hypothesis, which, was, launched, by, a, study, of, the, same, name, in, 1997, by, two, scientists, from, columbia, university, postulates, that, the, bosporus, was, flooded, around, 5600, bce, revised, to, 6800, bce, in, 2003, when, the, rising, waters, of, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, sea, of, marmara, broke, through, to, the, black, sea, which, at, the, time, according, to, the, hypothesis, was, a, low, lying, body, of, fresh, water, many, geologists, however, claim, that, the, strait, is, much, older, even, if, relatively, young, on, a, geologic, timescale, the, limits, of, the, bosporus, are, defined, as, the, line, connecting, the, lighthouses, of, rumeli, feneri, and, anadolu, feneri, in, the, north, and, between, the, ah, rkap, feneri, and, the, kad, k, y, nciburnu, feneri, in, the, south, fener, is, turkish, for, lighthouse, between, these, limits, the, strait, is, 31, km, 17, nmi, long, with, a, width, of, 3, 329, m, 1, 798, nmi, at, the, northern, entrance, and, 2, 826, m, 1, 526, nmi, at, the, southern, entrance, its, maximum, width, is, 3, 420, m, 1, 85, nmi, between, umuryeri, and, b, y, kdere, liman, and, minimum, width, is, 700, m, 0, 38, nmi, between, kandilli, point, and, a, iyan, the, depth, of, the, bosporus, varies, from, 13, to, 110, m, 43, to, 361, ft, in, midstream, with, an, average, of, 65, m, 213, ft, the, deepest, point, is, between, kandilli, and, bebek, at, 110, m, 360, ft, the, shallowest, locations, are, off, kad, k, y, nciburnu, at, 18, m, 59, ft, and, off, a, iyan, point, at, 13, m, 43, ft, the, southbound, flow, of, water, is, 16, 000, m, 3, s, fresh, water, at, the, surface, and, the, northbound, flow, is, 11, 000, m, 3, s, salt, water, near, the, bottom, dan, parsons, and, researchers, at, the, university, of, leeds, school, of, earth, and, environment, describe, a, black, sea, undersea, river, the, golden, horn, is, an, estuary, off, the, main, strait, that, historically, acted, as, a, moat, to, protect, constantinople, from, attack, as, well, as, providing, sheltered, anchorage, for, the, imperial, navies, of, various, empires, until, the, 19th, century, after, which, it, became, a, historic, neighbourhood, at, the, heart, of, istanbul, before, the, 20th, century, it, was, already, known, that, the, black, sea, and, the, sea, of, marmara, flow, into, each, other, in, a, geographic, example, of, density, flow, then, in, august, 2010, a, continuous, underwater, channel, of, suspension, composition, was, discovered, flowing, along, the, floor, of, the, bosporus, which, would, be, the, sixth, largest, river, on, earth, if, it, were, on, land, the, 2010, team, of, scientists, led, by, the, university, of, leeds, used, a, robotic, yellow, submarine, to, observe, detailed, flows, within, this, undersea, river, scientifically, referred, to, as, a, submarine, channel, for, the, first, time, submarine, channels, are, similar, to, land, rivers, but, they, are, formed, by, density, currents, underwater, flow, mixtures, of, sand, mud, and, water, that, are, denser, than, sea, water, and, so, sink, and, flow, along, the, bottom, these, channels, are, the, main, transport, pathway, for, sediments, to, the, deep, sea, where, they, form, sedimentary, deposits, the, team, studied, the, detailed, flow, within, these, channels, and, its, findings, included, that, the, channel, complex, and, the, density, flow, provide, the, ideal, natural, laboratory, for, investigating, and, detailing, the, structure, of, the, flow, field, through, the, channel, our, initial, findings, show, that, the, flow, in, these, channels, is, quite, different, to, the, flow, in, river, channels, on, land, specifically, as, flow, moves, around, a, bend, it, spirals, in, the, opposite, direction, in, the, deep, sea, compared, to, the, spiral, found, in, river, channels, on, land, this, is, important, in, understanding, the, sedimentology, and, layers, of, sediment, deposited, by, these, systems, the, central, tenet, of, the, black, sea, deluge, hypothesis, is, that, as, the, ocean, rose, 72, 5, metres, 238, ft, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, when, the, massive, ice, sheets, melted, the, sealed, bosporus, was, overwhelmed, by, a, spectacular, flood, that, increased, the, then, fresh, water, black, sea, lake, by, 50, and, drove, people, back, from, the, shores, for, many, months, this, hypothesis, was, supported, by, the, findings, of, undersea, explorer, robert, ballard, who, discovered, settlements, along, the, old, shoreline, scientists, dated, the, flood, to, 7500, bp, or, 5500, bc, from, fresh, salt, water, microflora, driven, out, by, the, rapidly, rising, water, which, must, have, been, terrifying, and, inexplicable, people, spread, to, all, corners, of, the, western, world, carrying, the, story, of, a, major, flood, as, the, waters, surged, they, scoured, a, network, of, sea, floor, channels, less, resistant, to, denser, suspended, solids, in, liquid, which, remains, a, very, active, layer, today, the, first, images, of, these, submarine, channels, showing, them, to, be, of, great, size, were, obtained, in, 1999, during, a, nato, saclant, undersea, research, project, using, jointly, the, nato, rv, alliance, and, the, turkish, navy, survey, ship, ubuklu, in, 2002, a, survey, carried, out, on, board, the, ifremer, rv, le, suroit, for, blason, project, lericolais, et, al, 2003, completed, the, multibeam, mapping, of, this, underwater, channel, fan, delta, a, complete, map, was, published, in, 2009, using, these, previous, results, together, with, high, quality, mapping, obtained, in, 2006, by, researchers, at, memorial, university, of, newfoundland, who, were, project, partners, in, the, study, the, project, was, led, by, jeff, peakall, and, daniel, parsons, at, the, university, of, leeds, in, collaboration, with, the, university, of, southampton, memorial, university, of, newfoundland, and, the, institute, of, marine, sciences, the, survey, was, run, and, coordinated, from, the, institute, of, marine, sciences, research, ship, the, r, v, koca, piri, reis, the, shores, of, the, bosporus, were, once, lined, with, small, fishing, villages, that, had, grown, up, since, byzantine, times, but, really, came, into, their, own, in, the, 19th, century, until, the, early, 20th, century, most, were, only, accessible, by, boat, known, as, caiques, along, the, bosporus, since, there, were, no, coast, roads, today, the, villages, are, no, more, than, suburbs, of, greater, istanbul, but, many, retain, the, memory, of, their, original, village, status, in, the, suffix, k, y, village, to, their, names, e, g, ortak, y, yenik, y, arnavutk, y, engelk, y, and, vanik, y, these, villages, often, had, distinct, identities, associated, with, agriculture, arnavutk, y, for, example, was, associated, with, strawberry, growing, while, engelk, y, was, famous, for, its, sweet, cucumbers, as, part, of, the, only, passage, between, the, black, sea, and, the, mediterranean, the, bosporus, has, always, been, of, great, importance, from, a, commercial, and, military, point, of, view, and, it, remains, strategically, important, today, it, is, a, major, sea, access, route, for, numerous, countries, including, russia, and, ukraine, control, over, it, has, been, an, objective, of, a, number, of, conflicts, in, modern, history, notably, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 78, as, well, as, of, the, attack, of, the, allied, powers, on, the, dardanelles, during, the, 1915, battle, of, gallipoli, in, the, course, of, world, war, i, in, 2022, during, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, the, bosporus, importance, as, a, route, by, which, grain, reached, the, world, was, thrown, into, sharp, profile, the, strategic, importance, of, the, bosporus, dates, back, millennia, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, greek, city, state, of, athens, which, depended, on, grain, imports, from, the, black, sea, ports, of, scythia, maintained, critical, alliances, with, cities, which, controlled, the, straits, such, as, the, megarian, colony, of, byzantium, in, an, attempt, to, subdue, the, scythian, horsemen, who, roamed, across, the, north, of, the, black, sea, the, persian, king, darius, i, the, great, r, 522, bc, 486, bc, crossed, the, bosporus, then, marched, towards, the, river, danube, his, army, crossed, the, bosporus, using, an, enormous, bridge, made, by, connecting, boats, this, bridge, essentially, connected, the, farthest, geographic, tip, of, asia, to, europe, encompassing, at, least, some, 1, 000, metres, of, open, years, later, xerxes, i, would, construct, a, similar, boat, bridge, across, the, dardanelles, hellespont, strait, 480, bc, during, his, invasion, of, greece, the, byzantines, called, the, bosporus, stenon, and, used, the, following, major, toponyms, in, the, area, the, strategic, significance, of, the, strait, was, one, of, the, factors, in, the, decision, of, the, roman, emperor, constantine, the, great, to, found, his, new, capital, constantinople, there, in, ad, 330, this, then, became, the, capital, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, on, 29, may, 1453, the, then, emergent, ottoman, empire, conquered, the, city, of, constantinople, following, a, lengthy, campaign, during, which, the, ottomans, constructed, fortifications, on, each, side, of, the, strait, the, anadoluhisar, anatolian, castle, 1393, and, the, rumelihisar, european, castle, 1451, in, preparation, for, not, only, the, primary, battle, but, to, assert, long, term, control, over, the, bosporus, and, surrounding, waterways, the, final, 53, day, campaign, which, resulted, in, ottoman, victory, constituted, an, important, turn, in, world, history, together, with, christopher, columbus, s, first, voyage, to, the, americas, in, 1492, the, 1453, conquest, of, constantinople, is, commonly, noted, as, among, the, events, that, brought, an, end, to, the, middle, ages, and, marked, the, transition, to, the, renaissance, and, the, age, of, discovery, the, event, also, marked, the, end, of, the, byzantines, the, final, remnants, of, the, roman, empire, and, the, transfer, of, the, control, of, the, bosporus, into, ottoman, hands, the, ottomans, then, made, constantinople, their, new, capital, and, the, base, from, which, they, expanded, their, empire, in, the, centuries, that, followed, at, its, peak, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, the, ottoman, empire, was, able, to, use, the, strategic, importance, of, the, bosporus, to, wrest, control, of, the, entire, black, sea, area, which, they, regarded, as, an, ottoman, lake, from, which, russian, warships, were, prohibited, subsequently, several, international, treaties, have, governed, access, to, the, strait, under, the, treaty, of, h, nk, r, skelesi, of, 8, july, 1833, the, bosporus, and, dardanelles, straits, were, to, be, closed, to, the, naval, vessels, of, other, powers, on, russian, demand, by, the, terms, of, the, london, straits, convention, concluded, on, 13, july, 1841, between, the, great, powers, of, europe, russia, the, united, kingdom, france, austria, and, prussia, the, ancient, rule, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, re, established, by, closing, the, turkish, straits, to, all, warships, barring, those, of, the, sultan, s, allies, during, wartime, this, benefited, british, naval, power, at, the, expense, of, the, russians, as, the, latter, then, lacked, direct, access, to, the, mediterranean, during, the, 19th, century, many, of, the, foreign, powers, represented, in, constantinople, maintained, second, embassies, up, the, bosporus, and, would, relocate, their, staff, there, during, the, hot, humid, summer, months, most, of, these, summer, embassies, were, on, the, european, shore, at, yenik, y, austrian, tarabya, german, english, french, italian, and, b, y, kdere, spanish, russian, some, of, the, buildings, still, survive, today, although, the, british, summer, embassy, burnt, down, in, 1911, and, the, italian, summer, embassy, a, fine, building, by, raimondo, d, aronco, survives, in, very, dilapidated, condition, following, the, first, world, war, the, 1920, treaty, of, s, vres, demilitarised, the, strait, and, made, it, an, international, territory, under, the, control, of, the, league, of, nations, this, was, amended, by, the, treaty, of, lausanne, 1923, which, restored, the, straits, to, turkey, but, allowed, all, foreign, warships, and, commercial, shipping, to, traverse, the, straits, freely, turkey, eventually, rejected, the, terms, of, that, treaty, and, remilitarised, the, straits, area, the, reversion, was, formalised, under, the, montreux, convention, regarding, the, regime, of, the, turkish, straits, of, 20, july, 1936, that, convention, which, is, still, in, force, treats, the, straits, as, an, international, shipping, lane, except, that, turkey, retains, the, right, to, restrict, the, naval, traffic, of, non, black, sea, states, turkey, was, neutral, in, the, second, world, war, until, february, 1945, and, the, straits, were, closed, to, the, warships, of, belligerent, nations, during, this, time, although, some, german, auxiliary, vessels, were, permitted, to, transit, in, diplomatic, conferences, soviet, representatives, had, expressed, an, interest, in, obtaining, naval, bases, on, the, straits, this, together, with, stalin, s, demands, for, the, restitution, of, the, turkish, provinces, of, kars, artvin, and, ardahan, to, the, soviet, union, which, were, lost, by, turkey, in, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1877, 1878, but, were, regained, with, the, treaty, of, kars, in, 1921, was, a, consideration, in, turkey, s, decision, to, abandon, neutrality, in, foreign, affairs, turkey, declared, war, against, germany, in, february, 1945, but, did, not, engage, in, offensive, actions, turkey, joined, nato, in, 1952, thus, affording, the, straits, even, more, strategic, importance, as, a, commercial, and, military, waterway, during, the, early, 21st, century, the, turkish, straits, have, become, particularly, important, for, the, oil, industry, russian, oil, from, ports, such, as, novorossiysk, was, exported, by, tankers, primarily, to, the, u, s, via, the, bosporus, and, the, dardanelles, straits, in, 2011, turkey, proposed, to, build, a, 50, km, 31, mi, canal, west, of, the, bosporus, suggesting, that, it, would, reduce, the, risk, presented, to, the, bosporus, by, oil, tankers, and, other, cargo, ships, the, project, proved, highly, controversial, and, as, of, 2022, work, had, not, been, started, on, building, the, canal, even, though, a, route, for, it, had, been, established, the, bosphorus, takes, its, name, from, the, greek, mythological, story, of, io, who, was, transformed, into, a, cow, and, pursued, by, a, gadfly, was, condemned, to, wander, the, earth, until, she, reached, the, strait, there, she, met, the, titan, prometheus, who, comforted, her, by, telling, her, that, she, would, be, restored, to, human, form, by, zeus, and, become, the, ancestor, of, the, greatest, of, all, heroes, heracles, hercules, according, to, ancient, greek, mythology, it, was, said, that, colossal, floating, rocks, known, as, the, symplegades, or, clashing, rocks, once, guarded, both, sides, of, the, bosporus, and, destroyed, any, ship, that, attempted, to, pass, through, the, strait, by, crushing, them, their, destructive, power, was, finally, overcome, by, the, argonaut, hero, jason, who, managed, to, pass, between, them, unscathed, whereupon, the, rocks, became, fixed, opening, greek, access, to, the, black, sea, the, bosporus, is, traversed, by, numerous, passenger, and, vehicular, ferries, daily, as, well, as, by, recreational, and, fishing, boats, ranging, from, dinghies, to, yachts, owned, by, both, public, and, private, entities, the, strait, also, serves, a, significant, amount, of, international, commercial, shipping, traffic, in, the, form, of, freighters, and, tankers, between, its, northern, limits, at, rumeli, feneri, and, anadolu, feneri, and, its, southern, ones, at, ah, rkap, feneri, and, kad, k, y, nciburnu, feneri, there, are, numerous, dangerous, points, for, large, scale, maritime, traffic, that, require, sharp, turns, and, management, of, visual, obstructions, famously, the, stretch, between, kandilli, point, and, a, iyan, requires, a, 45, degree, course, alteration, in, a, location, where, the, currents, can, reach, 7, to, 8, knots, 3, 6, to, 4, 1, m, s, to, the, south, at, yenik, y, the, necessary, course, alteration, is, 80, degrees, compounding, these, difficult, changes, in, trajectory, the, rear, and, forward, sight, lines, at, kandilli, and, yenik, y, are, also, completely, blocked, prior, to, and, during, the, course, alteration, making, it, impossible, for, ships, approaching, from, the, opposite, direction, to, see, around, the, bends, the, risks, posed, by, this, geography, are, further, multiplied, by, the, heavy, ferry, traffic, across, the, strait, linking, the, european, and, asian, sides, of, the, city, as, such, all, the, dangers, and, obstacles, characteristic, of, narrow, waterways, are, present, and, acute, in, this, vital, sea, lane, in, 2011, the, turkish, government, started, to, discuss, creating, a, man, made, canal, roughly, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, long, that, would, run, north, south, through, the, western, edges, of, istanbul, province, as, a, second, route, from, the, black, sea, to, the, marmara, it, was, suggested, that, this, would, reduce, the, risk, from, shipping, to, the, bosporus, the, controverislal, kanal, stanbul, project, continues, to, be, debated, in, 2022, the, dues, levied, by, turkey, for, freight, ships, increased, 500, to, us, 4, per, ton, the, first, change, since, 1983, the, bosporus, is, fairly, deep, and, there, is, no, definite, limit, on, the, depth, and, length, of, a, ship, but, ships, over, 150, metres, long, or, 10, metres, deep, must, pre, book, their, passage, those, over, 300, metres, long, must, follow, a, special, clearance, procedure, there, is, an, air, draft, limit, of, 57, metres, two, suspension, bridges, and, a, cable, stayed, bridge, cross, the, bosporus, the, first, of, these, the, 1, 074, m, 3, 524, ft, long, 15th, july, martyrs, bridge, was, completed, in, 1973, when, it, was, called, the, bosporus, bridge, the, second, named, fatih, sultan, mehmet, bosporus, ii, bridge, is, 1, 090, m, 3, 576, ft, long, and, was, completed, in, 1988, about, 5, km, 3, mi, north, of, the, first, bridge, the, first, bosporus, bridge, forms, part, of, the, o1, motorway, while, the, fatih, sultan, mehmet, bridge, forms, part, of, the, trans, european, motorway, the, third, and, most, recent, bridge, the, yavuz, sultan, selim, bridge, is,
