a, prime, meridian, is, an, arbitrarily, chosen, meridian, a, line, of, longitude, in, a, geographic, coordinate, system, at, which, longitude, is, defined, to, be, 0, together, a, prime, meridian, and, its, anti, meridian, the, 180th, meridian, in, a, 360, system, form, a, great, circle, this, great, circle, divides, a, spheroid, like, earth, into, two, hemispheres, the, eastern, hemisphere, and, the, western, hemisphere, for, an, east, west, notational, system, for, earth, s, prime, meridian, various, conventions, have, been, used, or, advocated, in, different, regions, throughout, history, earth, s, current, international, standard, prime, meridian, is, the, iers, reference, meridian, it, is, derived, but, differs, slightly, from, the, greenwich, meridian, the, previous, standard, a, prime, meridian, for, a, planetary, body, not, tidally, locked, or, at, least, not, in, synchronous, rotation, is, entirely, arbitrary, unlike, an, equator, which, is, determined, by, the, axis, of, rotation, however, for, celestial, objects, that, are, tidally, locked, more, specifically, synchronous, their, prime, meridians, are, determined, by, the, face, always, inward, of, the, orbit, a, planet, facing, its, star, or, a, moon, facing, its, planet, just, as, equators, are, determined, by, rotation, longitudes, for, the, earth, and, moon, are, measured, from, their, prime, meridian, at, 0, to, 180, east, and, west, for, all, other, solar, system, bodies, longitude, is, measured, from, 0, their, prime, meridian, to, 360, west, longitudes, are, used, if, the, rotation, of, the, body, is, prograde, or, direct, like, earth, meaning, that, its, direction, of, rotation, is, the, same, as, that, of, its, orbit, east, longitudes, are, used, if, the, rotation, is, retrograde, the, notion, of, longitude, for, greeks, was, developed, by, the, greek, eratosthenes, c, 276, 195, bce, in, alexandria, and, hipparchus, c, 190, 120, bce, in, rhodes, and, applied, to, a, large, number, of, cities, by, the, geographer, strabo, 64, 63, bce, c, 24, ce, but, it, was, ptolemy, c, 90, 168, ce, who, first, used, a, consistent, meridian, for, a, world, map, in, his, geographia, ptolemy, used, as, his, basis, the, fortunate, isles, a, group, of, islands, in, the, atlantic, which, are, usually, associated, with, the, canary, islands, 13, to, 18, w, although, his, maps, correspond, more, closely, to, the, cape, verde, islands, 22, to, 25, w, the, main, point, is, to, be, comfortably, west, of, the, western, tip, of, africa, 17, 5, w, as, negative, numbers, were, not, yet, in, use, his, prime, meridian, corresponds, to, 18, 40, west, of, winchester, about, 20, w, today, at, that, time, the, chief, method, of, determining, longitude, was, by, using, the, reported, times, of, lunar, eclipses, in, different, countries, one, of, the, earliest, known, descriptions, of, standard, time, in, india, appeared, in, the, 4th, century, ce, astronomical, treatise, surya, siddhanta, postulating, a, spherical, earth, the, book, described, the, thousands, years, old, customs, of, the, prime, meridian, or, zero, longitude, as, passing, through, avanti, the, ancient, name, for, the, historic, city, of, ujjain, and, rohitaka, the, ancient, name, for, rohtak, 28, 54, n, 76, 38, e, 28, 900, n, 76, 633, e, 28, 900, 76, 633, rohitaka, rohtak, a, city, near, the, kurukshetra, ptolemy, s, geographia, was, first, printed, with, maps, at, bologna, in, 1477, and, many, early, globes, in, the, 16th, century, followed, his, lead, but, there, was, still, a, hope, that, a, natural, basis, for, a, prime, meridian, existed, christopher, columbus, reported, 1493, that, the, compass, pointed, due, north, somewhere, in, mid, atlantic, and, this, fact, was, used, in, the, important, treaty, of, tordesillas, of, 1494, which, settled, the, territorial, dispute, between, spain, and, portugal, over, newly, discovered, lands, the, tordesillas, line, was, eventually, settled, at, 370, leagues, 2, 193, kilometers, 1, 362, statute, miles, or, 1, 184, nautical, miles, west, of, cape, verde, this, is, shown, in, the, copies, of, spain, s, padron, real, made, by, diogo, ribeiro, in, 1527, and, 1529, s, o, miguel, island, 25, 5, w, in, the, azores, was, still, used, for, the, same, reason, as, late, as, 1594, by, christopher, saxton, although, by, then, it, had, been, shown, that, the, zero, magnetic, declination, line, did, not, follow, a, line, of, longitude, in, 1541, mercator, produced, his, famous, 41, cm, terrestrial, globe, and, drew, his, prime, meridian, precisely, through, fuerteventura, 14, 1, w, in, the, canaries, his, later, maps, used, the, azores, following, the, magnetic, hypothesis, but, by, the, time, that, ortelius, produced, the, first, modern, atlas, in, 1570, other, islands, such, as, cape, verde, were, coming, into, use, in, his, atlas, longitudes, were, counted, from, 0, to, 360, not, 180, w, to, 180, e, as, is, usual, today, this, practice, was, followed, by, navigators, well, into, the, 18th, century, in, 1634, cardinal, richelieu, used, the, westernmost, island, of, the, canaries, el, hierro, 19, 55, west, of, paris, as, the, choice, of, meridian, the, geographer, delisle, decided, to, round, this, off, to, 20, so, that, it, simply, became, the, meridian, of, paris, disguised, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, battle, was, on, to, improve, the, determination, of, longitude, at, sea, leading, to, the, development, of, the, marine, chronometer, by, john, harrison, but, it, was, the, development, of, accurate, star, charts, principally, by, the, first, british, astronomer, royal, john, flamsteed, between, 1680, and, 1719, and, disseminated, by, his, successor, edmund, halley, that, enabled, navigators, to, use, the, lunar, method, of, determining, longitude, more, accurately, using, the, octant, developed, by, thomas, godfrey, and, john, hadley, in, the, 18th, century, most, countries, in, europe, adapted, their, own, prime, meridian, usually, through, their, capital, hence, in, france, the, paris, meridian, was, prime, in, prussia, it, was, the, berlin, meridian, in, denmark, the, copenhagen, meridian, and, in, united, kingdom, the, greenwich, meridian, between, 1765, and, 1811, nevil, maskelyne, published, 49, issues, of, the, nautical, almanac, based, on, the, meridian, of, the, royal, observatory, greenwich, maskelyne, s, tables, not, only, made, the, lunar, method, practicable, they, also, made, the, greenwich, meridian, the, universal, reference, point, even, the, french, translations, of, the, nautical, almanac, retained, maskelyne, s, calculations, from, greenwich, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, every, other, table, in, the, connaissance, des, temps, considered, the, paris, meridian, as, the, prime, in, 1884, at, the, international, meridian, conference, in, washington, d, c, 22, countries, voted, to, adopt, the, greenwich, meridian, as, the, prime, meridian, of, the, world, the, french, argued, for, a, neutral, line, mentioning, the, azores, and, the, bering, strait, but, eventually, abstained, and, continued, to, use, the, paris, meridian, until, 1911, the, current, international, standard, prime, meridian, is, the, iers, reference, meridian, the, international, hydrographic, organization, adopted, an, early, version, of, the, irm, in, 1983, for, all, nautical, charts, it, was, adopted, for, air, navigation, by, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, on, 3, march, 1989, since, 1984, the, international, standard, for, the, earth, s, prime, meridian, is, the, iers, reference, meridian, between, 1884, and, 1984, the, meridian, of, greenwich, was, the, world, standard, these, meridians, are, very, close, to, each, other, in, october, 1884, the, greenwich, meridian, was, selected, by, delegates, forty, one, delegates, representing, twenty, five, nations, to, the, international, meridian, conference, held, in, washington, d, c, united, states, to, be, the, common, zero, of, longitude, and, standard, of, time, reckoning, throughout, the, world, the, position, of, the, historic, prime, meridian, based, at, the, royal, observatory, greenwich, was, established, by, sir, george, airy, in, 1851, it, was, defined, by, the, location, of, the, airy, transit, circle, ever, since, the, first, observation, he, took, with, it, prior, to, that, it, was, defined, by, a, succession, of, earlier, transit, instruments, the, first, of, which, was, acquired, by, the, second, astronomer, royal, edmond, halley, in, 1721, it, was, set, up, in, the, extreme, north, west, corner, of, the, observatory, between, flamsteed, house, and, the, western, summer, house, this, spot, now, subsumed, into, flamsteed, house, is, roughly, 43, metres, 47, yards, to, the, west, of, the, airy, transit, circle, a, distance, equivalent, to, roughly, 2, seconds, of, longitude, it, was, airy, s, transit, circle, that, was, adopted, in, principle, with, french, delegates, who, pressed, for, adoption, of, the, paris, meridian, abstaining, as, the, prime, meridian, of, the, world, at, the, 1884, international, meridian, conference, all, of, these, greenwich, meridians, were, located, via, an, astronomic, observation, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, oriented, via, a, plumb, line, along, the, direction, of, gravity, at, the, surface, this, astronomic, greenwich, meridian, was, disseminated, around, the, world, first, via, the, lunar, distance, method, then, by, chronometers, carried, on, ships, then, via, telegraph, lines, carried, by, submarine, communications, cables, then, via, radio, time, signals, one, remote, longitude, ultimately, based, on, the, greenwich, meridian, using, these, methods, was, that, of, the, north, american, datum, 1927, or, nad27, an, ellipsoid, whose, surface, best, matches, mean, sea, level, under, the, united, states, beginning, in, 1973, the, international, time, bureau, and, later, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, changed, from, reliance, on, optical, instruments, like, the, airy, transit, circle, to, techniques, such, as, lunar, laser, ranging, satellite, laser, ranging, and, very, long, baseline, interferometry, the, new, techniques, resulted, in, the, iers, reference, meridian, the, plane, of, which, passes, through, the, centre, of, mass, of, the, earth, this, differs, from, the, plane, established, by, the, airy, transit, which, is, affected, by, vertical, deflection, the, local, vertical, is, affected, by, influences, such, as, nearby, mountains, the, change, from, relying, on, the, local, vertical, to, using, a, meridian, based, on, the, centre, of, the, earth, caused, the, modern, prime, meridian, to, be, 5, 3, east, of, the, astronomic, greenwich, prime, meridian, through, the, airy, transit, circle, at, the, latitude, of, greenwich, this, amounts, to, 102, metres, 112, yards, this, was, officially, accepted, by, the, bureau, international, de, l, heure, bih, in, 1984, via, its, bts84, bih, terrestrial, system, that, later, became, wgs84, world, geodetic, system, 1984, and, the, various, international, terrestrial, reference, frames, itrfs, due, to, the, movement, of, earth, s, tectonic, plates, the, line, of, 0, longitude, along, the, surface, of, the, earth, has, slowly, moved, toward, the, west, from, this, shifted, position, by, a, few, centimetres, inches, that, is, towards, the, airy, transit, circle, or, the, airy, transit, circle, has, moved, toward, the, east, depending, on, your, point, of, view, since, 1984, or, the, 1960s, with, the, introduction, of, satellite, technology, it, became, possible, to, create, a, more, accurate, and, detailed, global, map, with, these, advances, there, also, arose, the, necessity, to, define, a, reference, meridian, that, whilst, being, derived, from, the, airy, transit, circle, would, also, take, into, account, the, effects, of, plate, movement, and, variations, in, the, way, that, the, earth, was, spinning, as, a, result, the, iers, reference, meridian, was, established, and, is, commonly, used, to, denote, the, earth, s, prime, meridian, 0, longitude, by, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, which, defines, and, maintains, the, link, between, longitude, and, time, based, on, observations, to, satellites, and, celestial, compact, radio, sources, quasars, from, various, coordinated, stations, around, the, globe, airy, s, transit, circle, drifts, northeast, about, 2, 5, centimetres, 1, inch, per, year, relative, to, this, earth, centred, 0, longitude, it, is, also, the, reference, meridian, of, the, global, positioning, system, operated, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, and, of, wgs84, and, its, two, formal, versions, the, ideal, international, terrestrial, reference, system, itrs, and, its, realization, the, international, terrestrial, reference, frame, itrf, a, current, convention, on, the, earth, uses, the, line, of, longitude, 180, opposite, the, irm, as, the, basis, for, the, international, date, line, download, coordinates, as, on, earth, starting, at, the, north, pole, and, heading, south, to, the, south, pole, the, iers, reference, meridian, as, of, 2016, passes, through, 8, countries, 4, seas, 3, oceans, and, 1, channel, as, on, the, earth, prime, meridians, must, be, arbitrarily, defined, often, a, landmark, such, as, a, crater, is, used, other, times, a, prime, meridian, is, defined, by, reference, to, another, celestial, object, or, by, magnetic, fields, the, prime, meridians, of, the, following, planetographic, systems, have, been, defined
