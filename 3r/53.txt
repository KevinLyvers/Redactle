https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Azov
the, sea, of, azov, is, an, inland, shelf, sea, in, eastern, europe, connected, to, the, black, sea, by, the, narrow, about, 4, km, 2, 5, mi, strait, of, kerch, and, sometimes, regarded, as, a, northern, extension, of, the, black, sea, the, sea, is, bounded, by, russia, on, the, east, and, by, ukraine, on, the, northwest, and, southwest, the, parts, of, ukraine, bordering, the, sea, are, currently, under, russian, occupation, it, is, an, important, access, route, for, central, asia, from, the, caspian, sea, via, the, volga, don, canal, the, sea, is, largely, affected, by, the, inflow, of, the, don, kuban, and, other, rivers, which, bring, sand, silt, and, shells, which, in, turn, form, numerous, bays, limans, and, narrow, spits, because, of, these, deposits, the, sea, bottom, is, relatively, smooth, and, flat, with, the, depth, gradually, increasing, toward, the, middle, because, of, the, river, inflow, water, in, the, sea, has, low, salinity, and, a, high, amount, of, biomass, such, as, green, algae, that, affects, the, water, colour, abundant, plankton, result, in, unusually, high, fish, productivity, the, sea, shores, and, spits, are, low, they, are, rich, in, vegetation, and, bird, colonies, the, sea, of, azov, is, the, shallowest, sea, in, the, world, with, the, depth, varying, between, 0, 9, and, 14, metres, 3, and, 46, ft, there, is, a, constant, outflow, of, water, from, the, sea, of, azov, to, the, black, sea, the, name, is, likely, to, derive, from, the, settlement, of, an, area, around, azov, whose, name, comes, from, the, kipchak, turkish, asak, or, azaq, lowlands, a, russian, pseudo, etymology, however, instead, derives, it, from, an, eponymous, cuman, prince, named, azum, or, asuf, said, to, have, been, killed, defending, his, town, in, 1067, a, formerly, common, spelling, of, the, name, in, english, was, the, sea, of, azoff, in, antiquity, the, sea, had, other, names, latin, palus, maeotis, greek, or, now, latin, mare, asoviense, in, antiquity, the, sea, was, usually, known, as, the, maeotis, swamp, ancient, greek, h, mai, tis, l, mn, latin, palus, maeotis, from, the, marshlands, to, its, northeast, it, remains, unclear, whether, it, was, named, for, the, nearby, maeotians, or, if, that, name, was, applied, broadly, to, various, peoples, who, happened, to, live, beside, it, other, names, included, lake, maeotis, or, maeotius, m, otius, or, m, otis, lacus, the, maeotian, or, maeotic, sea, m, otium, or, m, oticum, quor, the, cimmerian, or, scythican, swamps, cimmeriae, or, scythic, paludes, and, the, cimmerian, or, bosporic, sea, cimmericum, or, bosporicum, mare, the, maeotians, themselves, were, said, by, pliny, to, call, the, sea, temarunda, alternative, spellings, temarenda, and, temerinda, meaning, mother, of, waters, the, medieval, russians, knew, it, as, the, sea, of, surozh, after, the, adjacent, city, now, known, as, sudak, it, was, known, in, ottoman, turkish, as, the, bal, k, denis, fish, sea, from, its, high, productivity, there, are, traces, of, neolithic, settlement, in, the, area, now, covered, by, the, sea, in, 1997, william, ryan, and, walter, pitman, of, columbia, university, published, a, theory, that, a, massive, flood, through, the, bosporus, occurred, in, ancient, times, they, claim, that, the, black, and, caspian, seas, were, vast, freshwater, lakes, but, in, about, 5600, bc, the, mediterranean, spilled, over, a, rocky, sill, at, the, bosporus, creating, the, current, link, between, the, black, and, mediterranean, seas, subsequent, work, has, been, done, both, to, support, and, to, discredit, this, theory, and, archaeologists, still, debate, it, this, has, led, some, to, associate, this, catastrophe, with, prehistoric, flood, myths, the, maeotian, marshes, around, the, mouth, of, the, tanais, river, the, present, day, don, were, famous, in, antiquity, as, they, served, as, an, important, check, on, the, migration, of, nomadic, people, from, the, eurasian, steppelands, the, maeotians, themselves, lived, by, fishing, and, farming, but, were, avid, warriors, able, to, defend, themselves, against, invaders, misled, by, its, strong, currents, ancient, geographers, had, only, a, vague, idea, of, the, extent, of, the, sea, whose, fresh, water, caused, them, to, typically, label, it, a, swamp, or, a, lake, herodotus, 5th, century, bc, judged, it, as, large, as, the, black, sea, while, the, pseudo, scylax, 4th, century, bc, thought, it, about, half, as, large, it, was, long, believed, to, provide, direct, communication, with, the, arctic, ocean, polybius, 2nd, century, bc, confidently, expected, that, the, strait, to, the, sea, of, azov, would, close, in, the, near, future, due, to, ongoing, deposition, of, sediments, from, rivers, in, the, 1st, century, strabo, reckoned, the, distance, from, the, cimmerian, bosporus, the, strait, of, kerch, to, the, mouth, of, the, tanais, at, 2200, stadia, a, roughly, correct, figure, but, did, not, know, that, its, width, continuously, narrows, milesian, colonization, began, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, bosporan, kingdom, was, named, for, the, cimmerian, bosporus, rather, than, for, the, more, famous, bosporus, at, the, other, end, of, the, black, sea, briefly, annexed, by, pontus, from, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, it, stretched, along, both, southern, shores, of, the, sea, of, azov, from, the, time, of, greek, colonization, to, the, end, of, the, roman, empire, serving, as, a, client, kingdom, which, exported, wheat, fish, and, slaves, in, exchange, for, greek, and, roman, manufactures, and, luxuries, its, later, history, is, uncertain, but, probably, the, huns, after, defeating, the, alans, people, who, had, settled, in, the, region, from, central, asia, overran, it, in, the, late, 4th, century, the, sea, of, azov, was, frequently, the, scene, of, military, conflicts, between, russia, pursuing, naval, expansion, to, the, south, and, the, major, power, in, the, region, turkey, during, the, russo, turkish, war, 1686, 1700, there, were, two, campaigns, in, 1695, 96, to, capture, the, then, turkish, fortress, of, azov, defended, by, a, garrison, of, 7, 000, the, campaigns, were, headed, by, peter, i, and, aimed, to, gain, russian, access, to, the, sea, of, azov, and, black, sea, the, first, campaign, began, in, the, spring, of, 1695, the, russian, army, consisted, of, 31, thousand, men, and, 170, cannons, and, included, selected, trained, regiments, and, cossacks, it, reached, azov, on, 27, 28, june, and, besieged, it, by, land, by, 5, july, after, two, unsuccessful, assaults, on, 5, august, and, 25, september, the, siege, was, lifted, the, second, campaign, involved, both, ground, forces, and, the, azov, fleet, which, was, built, in, moscow, oblast, voronezh, bryansk, and, other, regions, between, winter, 1695, and, spring, 1696, in, april, 1696, the, army, of, 75, 000, headed, by, aleksei, shein, moved, to, azov, by, land, and, by, ship, via, the, don, river, to, taganrog, in, early, may, they, were, joined, by, another, fleet, led, by, peter, i, on, 27, may, the, russian, fleet, blocked, azov, by, sea, on, 14, june, the, turkish, fleet, tried, to, break, the, blockade, but, after, losing, two, ships, retreated, to, the, sea, after, intensive, bombardment, of, the, fortress, from, land, and, sea, on, 17, july, the, russian, army, broke, the, defense, lines, and, occupied, parts, of, the, wall, after, heavy, fighting, the, garrison, surrendered, on, 17, july, after, the, war, the, russian, fleet, base, was, moved, to, taganrog, and, azov, and, 215, ships, were, built, there, between, 1696, and, 1711, in, 1711, as, a, result, of, the, russo, turkish, war, 1710, 1711, and, the, treaty, of, the, pruth, azov, was, returned, to, turkey, and, the, russian, azov, fleet, was, destroyed, the, city, was, recaptured, by, russia, in, 1737, during, the, russo, austrian, turkish, war, 1735, 1739, however, as, a, result, of, the, consequent, treaty, of, ni, russia, was, not, allowed, to, keep, the, fortress, and, military, fleet, another, major, military, campaign, on, the, sea, of, azov, took, place, during, the, crimean, war, of, 1853, 56, a, naval, and, ground, campaign, pitting, the, allied, navies, of, britain, and, france, against, russia, took, place, between, may, and, november, 1855, the, british, and, french, forces, besieged, taganrog, aiming, to, disrupt, russian, supplies, to, crimea, capturing, taganrog, would, also, result, in, an, attack, on, rostov, which, was, a, strategic, city, for, russian, support, of, their, caucasian, operations, on, 12, may, 1855, the, allied, forces, easily, captured, kerch, and, gained, access, to, the, sea, of, azov, and, on, 22, may, they, attacked, taganrog, the, attack, failed, and, was, followed, by, a, siege, despite, the, vast, superiority, of, the, allied, forces, about, 16, 000, soldiers, against, fewer, than, 2, 000, the, city, withstood, all, attempts, to, capture, it, which, ended, around, august, 1855, with, the, retreat, of, the, allied, army, individual, coastal, attacks, continued, without, success, and, ceased, in, october, 1855, in, december, 2003, ukraine, and, the, russian, federation, agreed, in, a, treaty, to, treat, the, sea, and, the, kerch, strait, as, shared, internal, waters, in, september, 2018, ukraine, announced, the, intention, to, add, navy, ships, and, further, ground, forces, along, the, coast, of, the, sea, of, azov, with, the, ships, based, at, berdiansk, the, military, posturing, was, exacerbated, following, the, construction, of, the, crimean, bridge, which, is, too, low, to, allow, passage, of, panamax, ships, into, ukraine, s, port, late, that, september, two, ukrainian, vessels, departed, from, the, black, sea, port, odesa, passed, under, the, crimean, bridge, and, arrived, in, mariupol, tensions, increased, further, after, the, kerch, strait, incident, in, november, 2018, when, russia, seized, three, ukrainian, navy, vessels, attempting, to, enter, the, sea, of, azov, control, of, the, western, shore, of, the, sea, is, vital, to, the, economy, of, ukraine, but, it, is, also, of, immense, strategic, importance, to, russia, as, a, land, route, to, crimea, as, well, as, it, is, for, passage, by, russian, marine, traffic, on, december, 10, 2021, the, ukrainian, navy, announced, that, russia, had, blocked, off, nearly, 70, percent, of, the, sea, of, azov, issuing, navigation, warnings, ostensibly, to, conduct, artillery, fire, exercises, on, the, sea, near, mariupol, berdyansk, and, henichesk, it, raised, apprehension, regarding, a, potential, russian, invasion, since, it, had, begun, amassing, tens, of, thousands, of, troops, near, the, southeast, ukraine, border, and, had, begun, a, propaganda, war, against, the, kyiv, government, the, russians, seized, three, ukrainian, military, vessel, as, the, boats, were, trying, to, cross, the, strait, and, captured, 24, sailors, who, were, finally, released, after, months, of, negotiations, on, february, 24, 2022, russian, forces, began, shelling, mariupol, at, the, start, of, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, by, may, with, the, end, of, the, siege, of, mariupol, russia, fully, captured, the, city, and, blocked, off, ukraine, s, access, to, the, sea, by, controlling, the, entire, north, pryazovia, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limit, of, the, sea, of, azov, in, the, kertch, strait, as, the, limit, of, the, black, sea, which, is, itself, defined, as, a, line, joining, cape, takil, and, cape, panaghia, 45, 02, n, the, sea, is, considered, an, internal, sea, of, russia, and, ukraine, and, its, use, is, governed, by, an, agreement, between, these, countries, ratified, in, 2003, the, sea, is, 360, kilometres, 220, mi, long, and, 180, kilometres, 110, mi, wide, and, has, an, area, of, 39, 000, square, kilometres, 15, 000, sq, mi, it, is, the, smallest, sea, within, the, countries, of, the, former, soviet, union, the, main, rivers, flowing, into, it, are, the, don, and, kuban, they, ensure, that, the, waters, of, the, sea, have, comparatively, low, salinity, and, are, almost, fresh, in, places, and, also, bring, in, huge, volumes, of, silt, and, sand, accumulation, of, sand, and, shells, results, in, a, smooth, and, low, coastline, as, well, as, in, numerous, spits, and, sandbanks, the, sea, of, azov, is, the, shallowest, sea, in, the, world, with, an, average, depth, of, 7, metres, 23, ft, and, maximum, depth, of, 14, metres, 46, ft, in, the, bays, where, silt, has, built, up, the, average, depth, is, about, 1, metre, 3, ft, the, sea, bottom, is, also, relatively, flat, with, the, depth, gradually, increasing, from, the, coast, to, the, centre, the, sea, of, azov, is, an, internal, sea, with, passage, to, the, atlantic, ocean, going, through, the, black, marmara, aegean, and, mediterranean, seas, it, is, connected, to, the, black, sea, by, the, strait, of, kerch, which, at, its, narrowest, has, a, width, of, 4, kilometres, 2, 5, mi, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 15, metres, 49, ft, the, narrowness, of, the, kerch, strait, limits, the, water, exchange, with, the, black, sea, as, a, result, the, salinity, of, the, sea, of, azov, is, low, in, the, open, sea, it, is, 10, 12, psu, about, one, third, of, the, salinity, of, the, oceans, it, is, even, lower, 2, 7, psu, in, the, taganrog, bay, at, the, northeast, end, of, the, sea, the, long, term, variations, of, salinity, are, within, a, few, psu, and, are, mostly, caused, by, changes, in, humidity, and, precipitation, although, more, than, 20, rivers, flow, into, the, sea, mostly, from, the, north, two, of, them, the, don, and, kuban, rivers, account, for, more, than, 90, of, water, inflow, the, contribution, of, the, don, is, about, twice, that, of, the, kuban, the, kuban, delta, is, located, at, the, southeast, on, the, east, side, of, the, kerch, strait, it, is, over, 100, km, long, and, covers, a, vast, flooded, area, with, numerous, channels, because, of, the, spread, the, delta, has, low, contrast, in, satellite, images, and, is, hardly, visible, in, the, map, the, don, flows, from, the, north, into, the, large, taganrog, bay, the, depth, there, varies, between, 2, and, 9, metres, while, the, maximum, depth, is, observed, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, typical, values, of, the, annual, inflow, and, outflow, of, water, to, the, sea, averaged, over, the, period, from, 1923, to, 1985, are, as, follows, river, inflow, 38, 6, km, 3, precipitation, 15, 5, km, 3, evaporation, 34, 6, km, 3, inflow, from, the, black, sea, 36, 38, km, 3, outflow, 53, 55, km, 3, thus, about, 17, km, 3, of, fresh, water, is, outflowing, from, the, azov, sea, to, the, black, sea, the, depth, of, azov, sea, is, decreasing, mostly, due, to, the, river, induced, deposits, whereas, the, past, hydrological, expeditions, recorded, depths, of, up, to, 16, metres, more, recent, ones, could, not, find, places, deeper, than, 13, 5, 14, metres, this, might, explain, the, variation, in, the, maximum, depths, among, different, sources, the, water, level, fluctuates, by, some, 20, cm, over, the, year, due, to, the, snow, melts, in, spring, the, taman, peninsula, has, about, 25, mud, volcanoes, most, of, which, are, active, their, eruptions, are, usually, quiet, spilling, out, mud, and, such, gases, as, methane, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, sulfide, but, are, sometimes, violent, and, resemble, regular, volcanic, eruptions, some, of, those, volcanoes, are, under, water, near, the, shores, of, the, peninsula, a, major, eruption, on, 6, september, 1799, near, stanitsa, golubitskaya, lasted, about, 2, hours, and, formed, a, mud, island, 100, metres, in, diameter, and, 2, metres, in, height, the, island, was, then, washed, away, by, the, sea, similar, eruptions, occurred, in, 1862, 1906, 1924, 1950, and, 1952, the, current, vertical, profile, of, the, sea, of, azov, exhibits, oxygenated, surface, waters, and, anoxic, bottom, waters, with, the, anoxic, waters, forming, in, a, layer, 0, 5, to, 4, metres, 1, 6, 13, 1, ft, in, thickness, the, occurrence, of, the, anoxic, layer, is, attributed, to, seasonal, eutrophication, events, associated, with, increased, sedimentary, input, from, the, don, and, kuban, rivers, this, sedimentary, input, stimulates, biotic, activity, in, the, surface, layers, in, which, organisms, photosynthesise, under, aerobic, conditions, once, the, organisms, expire, the, dead, organic, matter, sinks, to, the, bottom, of, the, sea, where, bacteria, and, microorganisms, using, all, available, oxygen, consume, the, organic, matter, leading, to, anoxic, conditions, studies, have, shown, that, in, the, sea, of, azov, the, exact, vertical, structure, is, dependent, on, wind, strength, and, sea, surface, temperature, but, typically, a, stagnation, zone, lies, between, the, oxic, and, anoxic, layers, many, rivers, flowing, into, the, sea, of, azov, form, bays, lagoons, and, limans, the, sand, silt, and, shells, they, bring, are, deposited, in, the, areas, of, reduced, flow, that, is, the, sides, of, the, bays, forming, narrow, sandbanks, called, spits, typical, maximum, depth, in, the, bays, and, limans, is, a, few, metres, because, of, shallow, waters, and, abundant, rivers, the, spits, are, remarkably, long, and, numerous, in, the, sea, the, arabat, spit, stretches, over, 112, kilometres, 70, mi, and, is, one, of, the, world, s, longest, spits, three, other, spits, fedotov, spit, achuevsk, spit, and, obitochna, spit, are, longer, than, 30, km, most, spits, stretch, from, north, to, south, and, their, shape, can, significantly, change, over, just, several, years, a, remarkable, feature, of, the, sea, of, azov, is, the, large, complex, of, shallow, lagoons, called, syvash, or, rotten, sea, their, typical, depth, is, only, 0, 5, 1, metres, with, a, maximum, of, 3, metres, they, cover, an, area, of, 2, 560, square, kilometres, 990, sq, mi, in, the, northeastern, crimea, which, is, separated, from, the, sea, by, the, arabatsk, spit, north, of, the, spit, lies, the, city, of, henichesk, population, 22, 500, and, south, of, it, is, the, bay, of, arabat, syvash, accepts, up, to, 1, 5, km, 3, of, azov, water, per, year, because, of, the, lagoons, wide, extent, and, shallowness, the, water, rapidly, evaporates, resulting, in, the, high, salinity, of, 170, on, the, practical, salinity, scale, i, e, 170, psu, for, this, reason, syvash, has, long, had, an, important, salt, producing, industry, north, of, the, arabat, spit, is, the, molochnyi, liman, with, the, associated, fedotov, spit, 45, km, long, which, are, formed, by, the, molochna, river, farther, north, between, the, fedotov, spit, and, obytochna, spit, 30, km, long, lies, obytochny, bay, further, north, between, obytochna, spit, and, berdyansk, spit, 23, km, long, is, berdyansk, bay, with, two, cities, berdyansk, population, 112, 000, and, primorsk, population, 13, 900, further, north, again, lies, belosaraysk, bay, with, belosaraysk, spit, formed, by, the, river, kalmius, the, major, city, in, the, area, is, mariupol, population, 491, 600, then, approaching, the, taganrog, bay, and, very, close, to, taganrog, are, the, mius, liman, and, krivaya, spit, formed, by, the, mius, river, with, an, area, of, about, 5, 600, square, kilometres, 2, 200, sq, mi, taganrog, bay, is, the, largest, bay, of, the, sea, of, azov, it, is, located, in, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, sea, and, is, bounded, by, the, belosaraysk, and, dolgaya, spits, the, don, flows, into, it, from, the, north, east, on, its, shores, stand, the, two, principal, cities, of, the, sea, of, azov, taganrog, population, 257, 600, and, azov, population, 83, 200, south, east, of, the, bay, is, yeysk, liman, it, lies, entirely, on, the, continent, entering, the, taganrog, bay, through, the, yeysk, and, glafirovsk, spits, and, is, the, mouth, of, the, yeya, river, yeysk, spit, is, part, of, yeysk, city, which, has, a, population, of, 87, 500, it, extends, into, the, prominent, yeysk, peninsula, which, is, tipped, in, the, north, west, by, the, dolgaya, spit, south, of, it, also, enclosed, by, the, continent, lies, beisug, liman, which, is, restricted, by, the, yasensk, spit, and, is, fed, by, the, beysug, river, south, west, of, the, liman, the, 31, km, long, achuevsk, spit, runs, along, the, coastline, between, the, achuevsk, spit, and, beisug, liman, stands, primorsko, akhtarsk, with, 32, 165, inhabitants, in, the, south, the, sea, of, azov, is, connected, to, the, black, sea, via, the, strait, of, kerch, which, is, bordered, to, the, west, by, the, kerch, peninsula, of, the, crimea, and, to, the, east, by, the, russian, taman, peninsula, in, krasnodar, krai, the, city, of, kerch, population, 151, 300, is, located, on, the, kerch, peninsula, and, the, taman, peninsula, contains, the, delta, of, the, kuban, a, major, russian, river, the, strait, is, 41, kilometres, long, and, 4, to, 15, kilometres, wide, its, narrowest, part, lies, on, the, sea, of, azov, side, restricted, by, the, chushka, spit, which, faces, southwards, in, consequence, of, the, outflow, from, the, azov, to, the, black, sea, the, strait, of, kerch, is, spanned, by, the, crimean, bridge, which, was, opened, in, may, 2018, this, is, a, major, geopolitical, issue, since, shipping, vessels, over, a, certain, size, can, not, pass, under, the, span, since, then, russia, has, been, accused, of, interdicting, shipping, through, the, kerch, strait, the, sea, is, relatively, small, and, nearly, surrounded, by, land, therefore, its, climate, is, continental, with, cold, winters, and, hot, and, dry, summers, in, autumn, and, winter, the, weather, is, affected, by, the, siberian, anticyclone, which, brings, cold, and, dry, air, from, siberia, with, winds, of, 4, 7, m, s, sometimes, up, to, 15, m, s, those, winds, may, lower, the, winter, temperatures, from, the, usual, 1, to, 5, c, to, below, 30, c, the, mean, mid, summer, temperatures, are, 23, 25, c, with, a, maximum, of, about, 40, c, winds, are, weaker, in, summer, typically, 3, 5, m, s, precipitation, varies, between, 312, and, 528, mm, year, and, is, 1, 5, 2, times, larger, in, summer, than, in, winter, average, water, temperatures, are, 0, 1, c, in, winter, 2, 3, c, in, the, kerch, strait, and, 24, 25, c, in, summer, with, a, maximum, of, about, 28, c, on, the, open, sea, and, above, 30, c, near, the, shores, during, the, summer, the, sea, surface, is, usually, slightly, warmer, than, the, air, because, of, the, shallow, character, of, the, sea, the, temperature, usually, lowers, by, only, about, 1, c, with, depth, but, in, cold, winters, the, difference, can, reach, 5, 7, c, the, winds, cause, frequent, storms, with, the, waves, reaching, 6, metres, in, the, taganrog, bay, 2, 4, metres, near, the, southern, shores, and, 1, metre, in, the, kerch, strait, in, the, open, sea, their, height, is, usually, 1, 2, metres, sometimes, up, to, 3, metres, winds, also, induce, frequent, seiches, standing, waves, with, an, amplitude, of, 20, 50, cm, and, lasting, from, minutes, to, hours, another, consequence, of, the, winds, is, water, currents, the, prevailing, current, is, a, counterclockwise, swirl, due, to, the, westerly, and, south, westerly, winds, their, speed, is, typically, less, than, 10, cm, s, but, can, reach, 60, 70, cm, s, for, 15, 20, m, s, winds, in, the, bays, the, flow, is, largely, controlled, by, the, inflow, of, the, rivers, and, is, directed, away, from, the, shore, in, the, kerch, strait, the, flow, is, normally, toward, the, black, sea, due, to, the, predominance, of, northern, winds, and, the, water, inflow, from, the, rivers, its, average, speed, is, 10, 20, cm, s, reaching, 30, 40, cm, in, the, narrowest, parts, although, the, sea, is, not, subject, to, tidal, variation, there, are, seasonal, changes, in, the, observed, sea, level, of, up, to, 10, 20, inches, 250, 510, mm, caused, by, seasonal, variations, in, river, outflows, the, shallowness, and, low, salinity, of, the, sea, make, it, vulnerable, to, freezing, during, the, winter, fast, ice, bands, ranging, from, 7, km, in, the, north, to, 1, 5, km, in, the, south, can, occur, temporarily, at, any, time, from, late, december, to, mid, march, several, ships, were, trapped, in, ice, in, 2012, when, it, froze, over, the, ice, thickness, reaches, 30, 40, centimetres, 12, 16, in, in, most, parts, of, the, sea, and, 60, 80, cm, in, the, taganrog, bay, the, ice, is, often, unstable, and, piles, up, to, the, height, of, several, metres, before, the, introduction, of, icebreakers, navigation, was, halted, in, the, winter, historically, the, sea, has, had, rich, marine, life, both, in, variety, with, over, 80, fish, and, 300, invertebrate, species, identified, and, in, numbers, consequently, fishing, has, long, been, a, major, activity, in, the, area, the, annual, catch, of, recent, years, was, 300, 000, tonnes, about, half, of, which, are, valuable, species, sturgeon, pike, perch, bream, sea, roach, etc, this, was, partly, due, to, extremely, high, biological, productivity, of, the, sea, which, was, stimulated, by, the, strong, supply, of, nutrients, from, numerous, rivers, feeding, the, sea, low, water, salinity, ample, heating, due, to, shallow, waters, and, long, vegetation, period, however, diversity, and, numbers, have, been, reduced, by, artificial, reduction, of, river, flow, construction, of, dams, over, fishing, and, water, intense, large, scale, cultivation, of, cotton, causing, increasing, levels, of, pollution, fish, hauls, have, rapidly, decreased, and, in, particular, anchovy, fisheries, have, collapsed, because, of, the, shallow, waters, the, development, of, aquatic, life, in, the, sea, of, azov, is, more, characteristic, of, a, lagoon, and, the, plankton, patterns, are, rather, similar, in, the, open, sea, and, near, the, shores, despite, its, shallowness, the, water, has, low, transparency, so, bottom, plants, are, poorly, developed, and, most, algae, are, of, planktonic, type, the, sea, is, characterised, by, high, concentrations, of, organic, matter, and, long, blooming, periods, another, specific, feature, of, the, sea, is, the, variable, salinity, low, in, the, large, bays, and, higher, in, the, open, sea, especially, near, the, kerch, strait, therefore, the, plankton, species, are, distributed, inhomogeneously, in, the, sea, of, azov, although, many, additional, species, are, brought, in, from, the, saltier, black, sea, most, of, them, cannot, adjust, to, the, variable, salinity, of, the, sea, of, azov, except, for, the, euryhaline, species, about, 600, species, of, planktonic, algae, are, known, in, the, sea, of, azov, the, number, of, species, is, dominated, by, diatoms, and, green, algae, blue, green, algae, and, pyrophites, are, significant, and, euglena, and, yellow, green, algae, form, only, 5, of, the, species, green, algae, are, mostly, responsible, for, the, colour, of, the, sea, in, the, satellite, images, see, photos, above, regarding, zooplankton, the, fresh, waters, of, the, tanganrog, bay, are, inhabited, by, cladocera, copepoda, and, rotifers, such, as, brachionus, plicatilis, keratella, curdata, and, asplanchna, western, part, of, the, sea, which, is, more, saline, hosts, three, forms, of, acartia, clausi, as, well, as, centropages, ponticus, meroplankton, and, larvae, of, gastropoda, bivalvia, and, polychaete, benthos, species, reside, mostly, at, the, sea, bottom, and, include, worms, crustaceans, bottom, protists, coelenterata, and, mollusks, mollusks, account, for, 60, 98, of, the, invertebrate, biomass, at, the, sea, of, azov, bottom, there, are, 183, ichthyofauna, species, from, 112, genera, and, 55, families, in, the, sea, of, azov, region, among, them, there, are, 50, rare, and, 19, endangered, species, and, the, sturgeon, acipenser, nudiventris, is, probably, extinct, in, the, region, the, fauna, of, the, freshwater, taganrog, bay, is, much, poorer, it, consists, of, 55, species, from, 36, genera, and, 16, families, among, them, three, species, are, rare, and, 6, are, endangered, the, shores, of, the, sea, of, azov, contain, numerous, estuaries, and, marshes, and, are, dominated, by, reeds, sedges, typha, and, sparganium, typical, submerged, plants, are, charales, pond, weed, hornworts, and, water, lilies, also, common, is, sacred, lotus, the, number, of, species, is, large, for, example, the, belosaraysk, and, berdyansk, spits, alone, contain, more, than, 200, each, some, spits, are, declared, national, nature, reserves, such, as, beglitsk, belosaraysk, krivaya, and, berdyansk, spits, estuaries, and, spits, of, the, sea, are, rich, in, birds, mostly, waterfowl, such, as, wild, geese, ducks, and, seagulls, colonies, of, cormorants, and, pelicans, are, common, also, frequently, observed, are, swans, herons, sandpipers, and, many, birds, of, prey, mammals, include, foxes, wild, cats, hares, hedgehogs, weasels, martens, and, wild, boar, muskrats, were, introduced, to, the, area, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, are, hunted, for, their, fur, some, ichthyofauna, species, such, as, anchovy, garfish, black, sea, whiting, and, pickerel, visit, the, sea, of, azov, from, the, black, sea, for, spawning, this, was, especially, frequent, in, 1975, 77, when, the, salinity, of, the, southern, sea, of, azov, was, unusually, high, and, additional, species, were, seen, such, as, bluefish, turbot, chuco, spurdog, black, sea, salmon, mackerel, and, even, corkwing, wrasse, rock, hopper, bullhead, and, eelpout, unlike, the, black, sea, plankton, which, does, not, adapt, well, to, the, low, salinity, of, the, sea, of, azov, and, concentrates, near, the, kerch, strait, fishes, and, invertebrates, of, the, black, sea, adjust, well, they, are, often, stronger, than, the, native, species, are, used, to, the, relatively, low, temperatures, of, the, black, sea, and, survive, winter, in, the, sea, of, azov, well, balanus, improvisus, is, the, first, benthos, species, which, spread, from, the, black, sea, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, settled, in, the, sea, of, azov, its, current, density, is, 7, kg, m, 2, from, 1956, rapana, venosa, is, observed, in, the, sea, of, azov, but, it, could, not, adjust, to, low, salinity, and, therefore, is, limited, to, the, neighborhood, of, the, kerch, strait, several, sea, of, azov, mollusks, such, as, shipworm, teredo, navalis, soft, shell, clam, mya, arernaria, mediterranean, mussel, mytilus, galloprovincialis, and, anadara, inaequivalvis, originate, from, the, black, sea, another, example, of, invading, species, is, the, dutch, crab, rhithropanopeus, harrisii, which, is, observed, both, in, saline, and, freshwater, parts, formerly, three, types, of, dolphins, short, beaked, common, dolphin, common, bottlenose, dolphin, and, harbour, porpoise, regularly, visited, the, sea, of, azov, from, the, black, sea, although, the, common, dolphin, usually, avoided, the, basin, and, kerch, strait, due, to, low, salinity, one, type, of, harbour, porpoise, phocoena, phocoena, relicta, used, to, live, in, the, sea, of, azov, and, was, therefore, called, azov, dolphin, in, the, soviet, union, nowadays, dolphins, are, rarely, observed, in, the, sea, of, azov, this, is, attributed, to, shallowing, of, the, sea, increasing, navigation, activities, pollution, and, reduction, in, the, fish, population, various, species, of, pinnipeds, and, belugas, were, introduced, into, black, sea, by, mankind, and, later, escaped, either, by, accidental, or, purported, causes, of, these, grey, seal, has, been, recorded, within, kerch, strait, and, sea, of, azov, mediterranean, monk, seals, became, extinct, in, the, black, sea, in, 1997, and, the, historic, presence, of, large, whales, such, as, minke, whales, in, the, black, sea, is, recorded, although, it, is, unclear, whether, these, mammals, historically, occurred, in, the, azov, basin, for, centuries, the, sea, of, azov, has, been, an, important, waterway, for, the, transport, of, goods, and, passengers, the, first, modern, ironworks, in, imperial, russia, were, located, upstream, on, the, kalmius, river, at, donetsk, originally, named, hughesovka, russian, it, was, also, important, for, the, transportation, of, iron, ores, from, the, mines, of, the, kerch, peninsula, to, the, processing, plant, of, azovstal, in, mariupol, formerly, zhdanov, ukraine, this, activity, stopped, after, the, closure, of, the, mines, in, the, 1990s, navigation, increased, after, the, construction, in, 1952, of, the, volga, don, canal, which, connected, the, sea, of, azov, with, the, volga, river, the, most, important, riverine, transport, route, in, the, central, russia, thus, connecting, major, cities, such, as, moscow, volgograd, and, astrakhan, currently, the, major, ports, are, in, taganrog, mariupol, yeysk, and, berdyansk, increasing, navigation, rates, have, resulted, in, more, pollution, and, even, in, ecological, disasters, on, 11, november, 2007, a, strong, storm, resulted, in, the, sinking, of, four, ships, in, the, strait, of, kerch, in, the, russian, port, of, kavkaz, the, ships, were, the, russian, bulk, carriers, volnogorsk, nakhichevan, kovel, and, the, georgian, haji, izmail, with, a, turkish, crew, six, other, ships, were, driven, from, their, anchors, and, stranded, and, two, tankers, were, damaged, volgoneft, 139, and, volgoneft, 123, as, a, result, about, 1300, tons, of, fuel, oil, and, about, 6800, tons, of, sulfur, entered, the, sea, another, traditional, activity, in, the, sea, is, fishing, the, sea, of, azov, used, to, be, the, most, productive, fishing, area, in, the, soviet, union, typical, annual, fish, catches, of, 300, 000, tonnes, converted, to, 80, kg, per, hectare, of, surface, the, corresponding, numbers, are, 2, kg, in, the, black, sea, and, 0, 5, kilograms, 1, 1, lb, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, catch, has, decreased, in, the, 21st, century, with, more, emphasis, now, on, fish, farming, especially, of, sturgeon, traditionally, much, of, the, coastline, has, been, a, zone, of, health, resorts, the, irrigation, system, of, the, taman, peninsula, supplied, by, the, extended, delta, of, the, kuban, river, is, favorable, for, agriculture, and, the, region, is, famous, for, its, vines, the, area, of, the, syvash, lagoons, and, arabat, spit, was, traditionally, a, centre, of, a, salt, producing, industry, the, arabat, spit, alone, produced, about, 24, 000, tonnes, year, in, the, 19th, century
