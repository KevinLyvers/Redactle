lake, eyre, r, air, officially, known, as, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, is, an, endorheic, lake, in, the, east, central, part, of, the, far, north, region, of, south, australia, some, 700, km, 435, mi, north, of, adelaide, the, shallow, lake, is, the, depocentre, of, the, vast, endorheic, lake, eyre, basin, and, contains, the, lowest, natural, point, in, australia, at, approximately, 15, m, 49, ft, below, sea, level, on, the, rare, occasions, that, it, fills, completely, it, is, the, largest, lake, in, australia, covering, an, area, of, up, to, 9, 500, km, 2, 3, 668, sq, mi, when, the, lake, is, full, it, has, the, same, salinity, as, seawater, but, becomes, hypersaline, as, the, lake, dries, up, and, the, water, evaporates, the, lake, was, named, in, honour, of, edward, john, eyre, the, first, european, to, see, it, in, 1840, it, was, officially, renamed, in, december, 2012, to, include, its, aboriginal, name, kati, thanda, in, accordance, with, a, policy, of, dual, naming, the, native, title, over, the, lake, and, surrounding, region, is, held, by, the, arabana, people, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, is, in, the, deserts, of, central, australia, in, northern, south, australia, the, lake, eyre, basin, is, a, large, endorheic, system, surrounding, the, lakebed, the, lowest, part, of, which, is, filled, with, the, characteristic, salt, pan, caused, by, the, seasonal, expansion, and, subsequent, evaporation, of, the, trapped, waters, even, in, the, dry, season, there, is, usually, some, water, remaining, in, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, normally, collecting, in, over, 200, smaller, sub, lakes, within, its, margins, the, lake, was, formed, by, aeolian, processes, after, tectonic, upwarping, occurred, to, the, south, subsequent, to, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, epoch, during, the, rainy, season, rivers, from, the, north, east, part, of, the, lake, eyre, basin, in, outback, south, west, and, central, queensland, flow, towards, the, lake, through, the, channel, country, the, amount, of, water, from, the, monsoon, determines, whether, water, will, reach, the, lake, and, if, it, does, how, deep, the, lake, will, get, the, average, rainfall, in, the, area, of, the, lake, is, 100, to, 150, millimetres, 3, 9, to, 5, 9, in, per, year, the, 15, m, 49, ft, altitude, usually, attributed, to, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, refers, to, the, deepest, parts, of, the, lake, floor, in, belt, bay, and, the, madigan, gulf, the, shoreline, lies, at, 9, m, 30, ft, the, lake, is, the, area, of, maximum, deposition, of, sediment, in, the, lake, eyre, basin, lake, eyre, is, divided, into, two, sections, which, are, joined, by, the, goyder, channel, these, are, known, as, lake, eyre, north, which, is, 144, kilometres, 89, mi, in, length, and, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, wide, and, lake, eyre, south, which, measures, 65, by, 24, kilometres, 40, by, 15, mi, the, salt, crusts, are, thickest, up, to, 50, cm, 20, in, in, the, southern, belt, bay, jackboot, bay, and, madigan, gulf, sub, basins, of, lake, eyre, north, since, 1883, proposals, have, been, made, to, flood, lake, eyre, with, seawater, brought, to, the, basin, via, a, canal, or, pipeline, the, purpose, was, in, part, to, increase, evaporation, and, thereby, increase, rainfall, in, the, region, downwind, of, an, enlarged, lake, eyre, the, added, rainfall, has, been, modelled, as, small, due, to, the, basin, s, low, elevation, below, sea, level, and, the, region, s, high, annual, evaporation, rate, between, 2, 500, and, 3, 500, millimetres, 98, and, 138, in, such, schemes, have, generally, been, considered, impractical, as, it, is, likely, that, accumulation, of, salt, deposits, would, rapidly, block, the, engineered, channel, at, a, rate, of, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, evaporation, per, day, a, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, viaduct, flowing, a, 0, 5, m, s, 1, 6, ft, s, would, supply, enough, water, to, create, a, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, sea, if, brine, water, were, not, sent, back, to, the, ocean, it, would, precipitate, 90, 000, long, tons, 91, 000, t, of, salt, every, year, the, salinity, in, the, lake, increases, as, the, 450, mm, 18, in, salt, crust, dissolves, over, a, period, of, six, months, of, a, major, flood, resulting, in, a, massive, fish, kill, when, over, 4, m, 13, ft, deep, the, lake, is, no, saltier, than, the, sea, but, salinity, increases, as, the, water, evaporates, with, saturation, occurring, at, about, a, 500, mm, 20, in, depth, the, lake, takes, on, a, pink, hue, when, saturated, due, to, the, presence, of, beta, carotene, pigment, caused, by, the, alga, dunaliella, salina, wangkangurru, also, known, as, arabana, wangkangurru, wangganguru, wanggangurru, wongkangurru, is, an, australian, aboriginal, language, spoken, on, wangkangurru, country, it, is, closely, related, to, arabana, language, of, south, australia, the, wangkangurru, language, region, was, traditionally, in, the, south, australian, queensland, border, region, taking, in, birdsville, and, extending, south, towards, innamincka, and, kati, thanda, including, the, local, government, areas, of, the, shire, of, diamantina, as, well, as, the, outback, communities, authority, of, south, australia, typically, a, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, flood, occurs, every, three, years, a, 4, m, 13, ft, flood, every, decade, and, a, fill, or, near, fill, a, few, times, a, century, the, water, in, the, lake, soon, evaporates, with, a, minor, or, medium, flood, drying, by, the, end, of, the, following, summer, most, of, the, water, entering, the, lakes, arrives, via, warburton, river, in, strong, la, ni, a, years, the, lake, can, fill, since, 1885, this, has, occurred, in, 1886, 1887, 1889, 1890, 1916, 1917, 1950, 1955, 1974, 1977, and, 1999, 2001, with, the, highest, flood, of, 6, m, 20, ft, in, 1974, local, rain, can, also, fill, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, to, 3, 4, m, 9, 8, 13, 1, ft, as, occurred, in, 1984, and, 1989, torrential, rain, in, january, 2007, took, about, six, weeks, to, reach, the, lake, but, only, placed, a, small, amount, of, water, into, it, when, recently, flooded, the, lake, is, almost, fresh, and, native, freshwater, fish, including, bony, bream, nematolosa, erebi, the,

1, 5, m, 5, ft, deep, in, late, may, which, is, a, quarter, of, its, maximum, recorded, depth, of, 6, m, 20, ft, 9, km, 3, 2, cu, mi, of, water, crossed, the, queensland, south, australian, border, with, most, of, it, coming, from, massive, floods, in, the, georgina, river, however, owing, to, the, very, low, rainfall, in, the, lower, reaches, of, these, rivers, contrasting, with, heavy, rainfall, in, the, upper, catchments, the, greater, proportion, soaked, into, the, desert, or, evaporated, en, route, to, the, lake, leaving, less, than, 4, km, 3, 0, 96, cu, mi, in, the, lake, which, covered, an, area, of, 800, km, 2, 309, sq, mi, or, 12, of, the, total, as, the, flood, did, not, start, filling, the, lake, s, deepest, point, belt, bay, until, late, march, little, bird, life, appeared, preferring, instead, to, nest, in, the, upper, reaches, of, the, lake, eyre, basin, north, of, birdsville, where, large, lakes, appeared, in, january, as, a, result, of, monsoonal, rain, the, high, rainfall, in, summer, 2010, sent, flood, water, into, the, diamantina, georgina, and, cooper, creek, catchments, of, the, lake, eyre, basin, with, the, cooper, creek, reaching, the, lake, for, the, first, time, since, 1990, the, higher, rainfall, prompted, many, different, birds, to, migrate, back, to, the, area, for, breeding, heavy, local, rain, in, early, march, 2011, in, the, stuart, creek, and, warriner, catchments, filled, lake, eyre, south, with, lake, eyre, north, about, 75, per, cent, covered, with, water, firstly, from, the, neales, and, macumba, rivers, and, later, from, the, warburton, river, in, late, 2015, water, began, flowing, into, lake, eyre, following, heavy, rain, in, the, north, east, of, the, state, in, late, march, 2019, floodwaters, began, arriving, as, a, result, of, torrential, rains, in, northern, queensland, in, january, in, the, past, the, water, had, taken, anywhere, from, three, to, 10, months, to, reach, the, lake, but, this, time, it, arrived, in, two, the, first, flooding, would, be, closely, followed, by, another, surge, following, rains, produced, by, cyclone, trevor, traditional, owners, and, graziers, agree, that, it, is, essential, that, the, river, run, its, course, and, should, not, be, harvested, during, floods, as, any, interference, in, the, natural, systems, could, damage, the, ecosystem, the, lake, eyre, yacht, club, is, a, dedicated, group, of, sailors, who, sail, on, the, lake, s, floods, including, recent, trips, in, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007, and, 2009, a, number, of, 6, m, 20, ft, trailer, sailers, sailed, on, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, in, 1975, 1976, and, 1984, when, the, flood, depth, reached, 3, 6, m, 9, 8, 19, 7, ft, in, july, 2010, the, yacht, club, held, its, first, regatta, since, 1976, and, its, first, on, lake, killamperpunna, a, freshwater, lake, on, cooper, creek, the, cooper, had, reached, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, for, the, first, time, since, 1990, it, is, estimated, that, these, waters, reach, lake, eyre, roughly, 8, years, in, 100, when, the, lake, is, full, a, notable, phenomenon, is, that, around, midday, the, surface, can, often, become, very, flat, the, surface, then, reflects, the, sky, in, a, way, that, leaves, both, the, horizon, and, water, surface, virtually, impossible, to, see, the, commodore, of, the, lake, eyre, yacht, club, has, stated, that, sailing, during, this, time, has, the, appearance, of, sailing, in, the, sky, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, has, been, a, site, for, various, land, speed, record, attempts, on, its, salt, flats, similar, to, those, found, in, the, bonneville, salt, flats, especially, those, by, donald, campbell, with, the, bluebird, proteus, cn7, phytoplankton, in, the, lake, includes, nodularia, spumigena, and, a, number, of, species, of, dunaliella, birds, such, as, pelicans, and, banded, stilts, are, drawn, to, a, filled, lake, from, southern, coastal, regions, of, australia, and, from, as, far, afield, as, papua, new, guinea, during, the, 1989, 1990, flood, it, was, estimated, that, 200, 000, pelicans, 80, of, australia, s, total, population, came, to, feed, and, roost, at, lake, eyre, scientists, are, presently, unable, to, determine, how, such, birds, appear, able, to, detect, the, filling, of, the, lake, even, when, hundreds, or, thousands, of, kilometres, away, from, the, basin, the, extent, of, the, lake, is, covered, by, two, protected, areas, declared, by, the, government, of, south, australia, the, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, national, park, and, the, elliot, price, conservation, park,
