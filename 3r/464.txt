000, the, urban, population, rose, from, 6, of, the, population, in, 1990, to, 16, 6, in, 2006, by, 2011, however, the, proportion, had, dropped, slightly, to, 14, 8, rwanda, has, been, a, unified, state, since, pre, colonial, times, and, the, population, is, drawn, from, just, one, cultural, and, linguistic, group, the, banyarwanda, this, contrasts, with, most, modern, african, states, whose, borders, were, drawn, by, colonial, powers, and, did, not, correspond, to, ethnic, boundaries, or, pre, colonial, kingdoms, within, the, banyarwanda, people, there, are, three, separate, groups, the, hutu, tutsi, and, twa, the, cia, world, factbook, gives, estimates, that, the, hutu, made, up, 84, of, the, population, in, 2009, the, tutsi, 15, and, twa, 1, the, twa, are, a, pygmy, people, who, descend, from, rwanda, s, earliest, inhabitants, but, scholars, do, not, agree, on, the, origins, of, and, differences, between, the, hutu, and, tutsi, anthropologist, jean, hiernaux, contends, that, the, tutsi, are, a, separate, race, with, a, tendency, towards, long, and, narrow, heads, faces, and, noses, others, such, as, villia, jefremovas, believe, there, is, no, discernible, physical, difference, and, the, categories, were, not, historically, rigid, in, precolonial, rwanda, the, tutsi, were, the, ruling, class, from, whom, the, kings, and, the, majority, of, chiefs, were, derived, while, the, hutu, were, agriculturalists, the, current, government, discourages, the, hutu, tutsi, twa, distinction, and, has, removed, such, classification, from, identity, cards, the, 2002, census, was, the, first, since, 1933, which, did, not, categorise, rwandan, population, into, the, three, groups, prior, to, 2012, the, rwandan, government, provided, free, education, in, state, run, schools, for, nine, years, six, years, in, primary, and, three, years, following, a, common, secondary, programme, in, 2012, this, started, to, be, expanded, to, 12, years, a, 2015, study, suggests, that, while, enrollment, rates, in, primary, schools, are, near, ubiquity, rates, of, completion, are, low, and, repetition, rates, high, while, schooling, is, fee, free, there, is, an, expectation, that, parents, should, contribute, to, the, cost, of, their, children, s, education, by, providing, them, with, school, supplies, supporting, teacher, development, and, making, a, contribution, to, school, construction, according, to, the, government, these, costs, should, not, be, a, basis, for, the, exclusion, of, children, from, education, however, there, are, many, private, schools, across, the, country, some, church, run, which, follow, the, same, syllabus, but, charge, fees, from, 1994, until, 2009, secondary, education, was, offered, in, either, french, or, english, because, of, the,
