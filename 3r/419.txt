ngorongoro, conservation, area, uk, r, r, o, us, r, o, r, o, o, r, o, r, o, is, a, protected, area, and, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, located, in, ngorongoro, district, 180, km, 110, mi, west, of, arusha, city, in, arusha, region, within, the, crater, highlands, geological, area, of, northeastern, tanzania, the, area, is, named, after, ngorongoro, crater, a, large, volcanic, caldera, within, the, area, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, authority, administers, the, conservation, area, an, arm, of, the, tanzanian, government, and, its, boundaries, follow, the, boundary, of, the, ngorongoro, district, in, arusha, region, the, western, portion, of, the, park, abuts, the, serengeti, national, park, and, the, area, comprising, the, two, parks, and, kenya, s, maasai, mara, game, reserve, is, home, to, great, migration, a, massive, annual, migration, of, millions, of, wildebeest, zebras, gazelles, and, other, animals, the, conservation, area, also, contains, olduvai, gorge, one, of, the, most, important, paleoanthropological, sites, in, the, world, the, 2009, ngorongoro, wildlife, conservation, act, placed, new, restrictions, on, human, settlement, and, subsistence, farming, in, the, crater, displacing, maasai, pastoralists, most, of, whom, had, been, relocated, to, ngorongoro, from, their, ancestral, lands, to, the, north, when, the, british, colonial, government, established, serengeti, national, park, in, 1959, the, name, of, the, crater, has, an, onomatopoeic, origin, it, was, named, by, the, maasai, pastoralists, after, the, sound, produced, by, the, cowbell, ngoro, ngoro, based, on, fossil, evidence, found, at, the, olduvai, gorge, various, hominid, species, have, occupied, the, area, for, 3, million, years, hunter, gatherers, were, replaced, by, pastoralists, a, few, thousand, years, ago, the, mbulu, came, to, the, area, about, 2, 000, years, ago, and, were, joined, by, the, datooga, around, the, year, 1700, both, groups, were, driven, from, the, area, by, the, maasai, in, the, 1800s, no, europeans, are, known, to, have, set, foot, in, the, ngorongoro, crater, until, 1892, when, it, was, visited, by, oscar, baumann, two, german, brothers, adolph, and, friedrich, siedentopf, farmed, in, the, crater, until, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, after, leasing, the, land, from, the, administration, of, german, east, africa, the, brothers, regularly, organized, shooting, parties, to, entertain, their, german, friends, they, also, attempted, to, drive, the, wildebeest, herds, out, of, the, crater, in, 1921, the, first, game, preservation, ordinance, was, passed, which, restricted, hunting, to, permit, holders, throughout, tanzania, in, 1928, hunting, was, prohibited, on, all, land, within, the, crater, rim, except, the, former, siedentopf, farms, the, national, park, ordinance, of, 1948, implemented, in, 1951, created, the, serengeti, national, park, snp, this, however, caused, problems, with, the, maasai, and, other, tribes, resulting, in, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, ordinance, 1959, that, separated, the, conservation, area, from, the, national, park, maasai, pastoralists, living, in, serengeti, national, park, were, systematically, relocated, to, ngorongoro, increasing, the, population, of, maasai, and, livestock, living, in, the, crater, 48, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, authority, was, established, by, the, game, park, laws, miscellaneous, amendments, act, 1976, and, owns, the, majority, of, ngorongoro, conservation, area, land, including, the, crater, the, area, became, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1979, originally, inscribed, for, its, natural, significance, it, then, received, mixed, heritage, status, in, 2010, its, cultural, recognition, stemming, from, an, exceptionally, long, sequence, of, crucial, evidence, related, to, human, evolution, and, human, environment, dynamics, including, physical, evidence, of, the, most, important, benchmarks, in, human, evolutionary, development, this, recognition, however, has, not, included, the, maasai, community, hence, the, longstanding, conflict, surrounding, the, use, and, management, of, the, park, the, wildlife, conservation, act, of, 2009, further, restricted, human, use, of, ngorongoro, crater, and, created, a, legal, framework, to, politically, disenfranchise, and, forcibly, displace, traditional, pastoralists, 57, 59, the, restriction, on, land, use, generates, tension, between, the, local, maasai, communities, and, conservation, authorities, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, is, seeking, solutions, to, ease, conflict, and, improve, collaborative, efforts, toward, conservation, with, the, locals, the, conservation, area, land, is, multi, use, and, unique, because, it, is, the, only, conservation, area, in, tanzania, that, protects, wildlife, while, allowing, human, habitation, land, use, is, controlled, to, prevent, negative, effects, on, the, wildlife, population, for, example, cultivation, is, prohibited, at, all, but, subsistence, levels, the, area, is, part, of, the, serengeti, ecosystem, and, to, the, northwest, adjoins, the, snp, and, is, contiguous, with, the, southern, serengeti, plains, these, plains, also, extend, to, the, north, into, the, unprotected, loliondo, division, and, are, kept, open, to, wildlife, through, transhumance, pastoralism, practiced, by, the, maasai, the, south, and, west, of, the, area, are, volcanic, highlands, including, the, famous, ngorongoro, crater, and, the, lesser, known, empakaai, crater, the, southern, and, eastern, boundaries, are, approximately, defined, by, the, rim, of, the, east, african, rift, wall, which, also, prevents, animal, migration, in, these, directions, the, pliocene, ngorongoro, volcanic, group, consists, of, eight, extinct, shield, volcanoes, within, the, eyasi, half, graben, the, eastern, boundary, marked, by, the, gregory, rift, western, escarpment, the, lake, eyasi, escarpment, bounds, the, half, graben, on, the, southwest, within, the, complex, five, volcanoes, are, dome, shaped, cones, while, three, have, calderas, ngorongoro, volcano, 2, 5, 1, 9, ma, is, primarily, basaltic, trachyandesite, the, caldera, is, fed, by, the, munge, and, oljoro, nyuki, rivers, while, the, ngoitokitok, hot, springs, feed, into, the, goringop, swamp, lake, magadi, is, a, shallow, 1, 7, m, alkaline, lake, other, volcanoes, within, the, complex, include, olmoti, 2, 01, 1, 79, ma, empakaai, loolmalasin, sadiman, 3, 7, ma, lemagrut, and, oldeani, the, northwest, portion, of, the, conservation, area, consists, of, the, serengeti, plains, the, salei, plains, the, oldupai, gorge, and, the, gol, mountains, inselbergs, these, inselbergs, are, part, of, the, mozambique, belt, quartzite, and, mica, schist, about, 800, 500, ma, in, age, the, main, feature, of, the, ngorongoro, conservation, authority, is, the, ngorongoro, crater, the, world, s, largest, inactive, intact, and, unfilled, volcanic, caldera, the, crater, which, formed, when, a, large, volcano, erupted, and, collapsed, on, itself, two, to, three, million, years, ago, is, 610, metres, 2, 000, feet, deep, and, its, floor, covers, 260, square, kilometres, 100, square, miles, estimates, of, the, height, of, the, original, volcano, range, from, 4, 500, to, 5, 800, metres, 14, 800, to, 19, 000, feet, high, the, crater, floor, is, 1, 800, metres, 5, 900, feet, above, sea, level, the, crater, was, voted, by, seven, natural, wonders, as, one, of, the, seven, natural, wonders, of, africa, in, arusha, tanzania, in, february, 2013, the, ngorongoro, volcano, was, active, from, about, 2, 45, to, 2, million, years, ago, volcanic, eruptions, like, that, of, ngorongoro, which, resulted, in, the, formation, of, ngorongoro, crater, in, tanzania, were, very, common, similar, collapses, occurred, in, the, case, of, olmoti, and, empakaai, but, they, were, much, smaller, in, magnitude, and, impact, out, of, the, two, recent, volcanoes, to, the, northeast, of, the, empakaai, caldera, kerimasi, and, ol, doinyo, lengai, doinyo, lengai, is, still, active, and, had, major, eruptions, in, 2007, and, 2008, smaller, ash, eruptions, and, lava, flows, continue, to, slowly, fill, the, current, crater, its, name, in, maasai, means, mountain, of, god, the, munge, stream, drains, olmoti, crater, to, the, north, and, is, the, main, water, source, draining, into, the, seasonal, salt, lake, in, the, center, of, the, crater, this, lake, is, known, by, two, names, makat, as, the, maasai, called, it, meaning, salt, and, magadi, the, lerai, stream, drains, the, humid, forests, to, the, south, of, the, crater, and, feeds, the, lerai, forest, on, the, crater, floor, when, there, is, enough, rain, the, lerai, drains, into, lake, magadi, as, well, extraction, of, water, by, lodges, and, ngorongoro, conservation, area, headquarters, reduces, the, amount, of, water, entering, lerai, by, around, 25, the, other, major, water, source, in, the, crater, is, the, ngoitokitok, spring, near, the, eastern, crater, wall, there, is, a, picnic, site, here, open, to, tourists, and, a, huge, swamp, fed, by, the, spring, and, the, area, is, inhabited, by, hippopotamuses, elephants, lions, and, many, others, many, other, small, springs, can, be, found, around, the, crater, s, floor, and, these, are, important, water, supplies, for, the, animals, and, local, maasai, especially, during, times, of, drought, maasai, were, previously, permitted, to, graze, their, cattle, within, the, crater, but, as, of, 2015, were, restricted, from, doing, so, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, also, protects, oldupai, or, olduvai, gorges, situated, in, the, plains, area, it, is, considered, to, be, the, seat, of, humanity, after, the, discovery, of, the, earliest, known, specimens, of, the, human, genus, homo, habilis, as, well, as, early, hominidae, such, as, paranthropus, boisei, the, olduvai, gorge, is, a, steep, sided, ravine, in, the, great, rift, valley, which, stretches, along, eastern, africa, olduvai, is, in, the, eastern, serengeti, plains, in, northeastern, tanzania, and, is, about, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, long, it, lies, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, ngorongoro, highlands, and, is, the, driest, part, of, the, region, the, gorge, is, named, after, oldupaai, the, maasai, word, for, the, wild, sisal, plant, sansevieria, ehrenbergii, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, prehistoric, sites, in, the, world, and, research, there, has, been, instrumental, in, furthering, understanding, of, early, human, evolution, excavation, work, there, was, pioneered, by, mary, and, louis, leakey, in, the, 1950s, and, is, continued, today, by, their, family, some, believe, that, millions, of, years, ago, the, site, was, that, of, a, large, lake, the, shores, of, which, were, covered, with, successive, deposits, of, volcanic, ash, around, 500, 000, years, ago, seismic, activity, diverted, a, nearby, stream, which, began, to, cut, down, into, the, sediments, revealing, seven, main, layers, in, the, walls, of, the, gorge, approximately, 25, 000, large, animals, mostly, ungulates, live, in, the, crater, large, mammals, in, the, crater, include, the, black, rhinoceros, diceros, bicornis, michaeli, the, local, population, of, which, declined, from, about, 108, in, 1964, 66, to, between, 11, 14, in, 1995, the, african, buffalo, or, cape, buffalo, syncerus, caffer, and, the, hippopotamus, hippopotamus, amphibius, there, also, are, many, other, ungulates, the, blue, wildebeest, connochaetes, taurinus, 7, 000, estimated, in, 1994, grant, s, zebra, equus, quagga, boehmi, 4, 000, the, eland, taurotragus, oryx, and, grant, s, nanger, granti, and, thomson, s, gazelles, eudorcas, thomsonii, 3, 000, waterbucks, kobus, ellipsiprymnus, occur, mainly, near, lerai, forest, absent, are, giraffe, impala, aepyceros, melampus, topi, damaliscus, lunatus, oribi, ourebia, oribi, and, crocodile, crocodylus, niloticus, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, raineyi, east, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, lupinus, and, african, leopard, panthera, pardus, pardus, are, rarely, seen, spotted, hyenas, crocuta, crocuta, have, been, the, subject, of, a, long, term, research, study, in, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, since, 1996, although, thought, of, as, a, natural, enclosure, for, a, very, wide, variety, of, wildlife, 20, percent, or, more, of, the, wildebeest, and, half, the, zebra, populations, vacate, the, crater, in, the, wet, season, while, cape, buffalo, syncerus, caffer, stay, their, highest, numbers, are, during, the, rainy, season, since, 1986, the, crater, s, wildebeest, population, has, fallen, from, 14, 677, to, 7, 250, 2003, 2005, the, numbers, of, eland, and, thomson, s, gazelle, also, have, declined, while, the, buffalo, population, has, increased, greatly, probably, due, to, the, long, prevention, of, fire, which, favors, high, fibrous, grasses, over, shorter, less, fibrous, types, serval, leptailurus, serval, occurs, widely, in, the, crater, lake, magadi, a, large, lake, in, the, southwest, of, the, crater, is, often, inhabited, by, thousands, of, mainly, lesser, flamingoes, the, crater, has, one, endemic, species, of, mammal, mduma, s, shrew, crocidura, mdumai, which, is, restricted, to, montane, forests, on, the, edge, of, the, crater, this, shrew, is, considered, endangered, due, to, deforestation, from, smallholder, farming, the, crater, has, one, of, the, densest, known, population, of, lions, numbering, 62, in, 2001, a, side, effect, of, the, crater, being, a, natural, enclosure, is, that, the, lion, population, is, significantly, inbred, this, is, due, to, the, very, small, amount, of, new, bloodlines, that, enter, the, local, gene, pool, as, very, few, migrating, male, lions, enter, the, crater, from, the, outside, those, who, do, enter, the, crater, are, often, prevented, from, contributing, to, the, gene, pool, by, the, crater, s, male, lions, who, expel, any, outside, competitors, long, term, data, imply, that, lions, in, the, crater, were, struck, by, four, deadly, disease, outbreaks, between, 1962, and, 2002, drought, in, 1961, and, rains, throughout, the, 1962, dry, season, caused, a, massive, build, up, of, blood, sucking, stable, flies, stomoxys, calcitrans, by, may, 1962, they, drained, blood, and, caused, painful, skin, sores, that, became, infected, causing, lion, numbers, to, crash, from, 75, 100, to, 12, the, population, recovered, to, around, 100, by, 1975, and, remained, stable, until, 1983, when, a, persistent, decline, began, numbers, have, generally, remained, below, 60, animals, since, 1993, reaching, a, low, of, 29, in, 1998, in, 2001, 34, percent, of, the, lion, population, died, between, january, and, april, from, a, combination, of, tick, borne, disease, and, canine, distemper, the, lion, population, is, also, influenced, to, some, extent, by, the, takeover, of, prides, by, incoming, males, which, typically, kill, small, cubs, the, biggest, influence, however, appears, to, be, disease, particularly, canine, distemper, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, has, a, healthy, resident, population, of, most, species, of, wildlife, and, masai, people, the, ndutu, lake, area, to, the, west, of, the, conservation, area, has, particularly, strong, cheetah, and, lion, populations, common, in, the, area, are, hartebeest, alcelaphus, buselaphus, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, and, jackals, the, population, of, african, wild, dog, may, have, declined, recently, servals, occur, widely, on, the, plains, to, the, west, of, the, ngorongoro, crater, the, annual, ungulate, migration, passes, through, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, with, 1, 7, million, wildebeest, 260, 000, zebra, and, 470, 000, gazelles, moving, into, the, area, in, december, and, moving, out, in, june, this, movement, changes, seasonally, with, the, rains, but, the, migration, traverses, almost, the, entire, plains, in, search, of, food, high, demands, for, natural, resources, and, modernity, from, an, increasing, resident, human, population, as, well, as, the, need, to, promote, and, manage, tourism, are, the, most, pressing, current, concerns, the, estimated, 93, 000, pastoralists, who, live, within, nca, today, are, nearly, five, times, the, number, that, were, there, when, the, property, was, listed, 1979, emerging, dwellings, and, settlements, have, apparent, ramifications, despite, the, fact, that, small, scale, agriculture, is, currently, illegal, communities, are, increasingly, requesting, the, resumption, of, subsistence, crop, farming, to, attain, food, self, sufficiency, escalating, tensions, between, residents, and, conservation, organizations, furthermore, approximately, 300, 000, domestic, animals, live, with, wildlife, on, nca, property, the, area, s, resident, pastoralist, community, has, gradually, increased, from, approximately, 8, 700, in, 1966, to, 20, 000, at, the, date, of, world, heritage, status, 1979, to, 93, 136, in, 2017, by, 2027, the, population, is, predicted, to, reach, 161, 000, people, the, repercussions, of, this, population, growth, include, increased, infrastructure, grazing, areas, human, wildlife, confrontations, and, land, use, conflicts, the, scenic, values, of, the, place, are, being, conserved, however, it, is, clear, that, houses, and, other, infrastructure, associated, with, the, growing, pastoralist, population, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, values, traditional, building, materials, and, techniques, based, on, locally, available, natural, materials, are, gradually, giving, way, to, the, use, of, imported, materials, e, g, cement, and, corrugated, iron, and, the, unsustainable, usage, of, heavy, poles, from, local, forests, although, the, ncaa, has, devised, a, set, of, building, codes, to, guide, such, developments, the, outcomes, of, code, implementation, are, unknown, lodge, and, tented, camp, developments, are, frequently, well, located, disguised, and, appropriately, constructed, whereas, pastoralist, habitation, is, uncontrolled, moving, vehicle, dust, plumes, have, a, minor, impact, on, scenic, qualities, in, the, near, term, uncontrolled, dwelling, unit, construction, on, the, property, would, damage, the, site, s, integrity, the, construction, of, structures, must, be, regularly, supervised, and, regulated, human, animal, conflict, occurs, whenever, livestock, is, lost, to, predatory, animals, and, or, depredated, by, wildlife, inside, or, near, a, conservation, area, the, maasai, have, a, long, tradition, of, coexisting, with, wildlife, and, have, developed, a, high, tolerance, for, it, poverty, food, insecurity, increasing, human, population, in, the, landscape, and, limiting, resources, on, the, other, hand, are, bringing, cow, and, animal, interactions, closer, together, as, well, as, intensifying, competition, and, conflict, historically, the, traditional, maasai, culture, has, posed, challenges, for, individuals, seeking, to, assume, complex, managerial, roles, within, their, communities, until, recently, there, was, resistance, among, the, maasai, towards, embracing, education, as, a, necessity, it, s, only, more, recently, that, attitudes, have, shifted, with, the, realization, that, to, influence, the, ongoing, changes, affecting, their, community, they, must, engage, with, external, influences, rather, than, remain, isolated, for, example, one, senior, traditional, leader, remarked, that, he, sincerely, regrets, running, away, from, school, as, a, child, and, he, has, probably, certainly, passed, this, attitude, on, to, the, younger, members, of, his, community, as, a, result, traditionally, the, ncaa, faced, a, significant, issue, in, encouraging, maasai, villages, to, use, any, schools, they, established, this, alone, will, have, dampened, the, ncaa, s, enthusiasm, for, school, building, initiatives
