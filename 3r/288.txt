great, britain, commonly, shortened, to, britain, is, an, island, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, off, the, north, west, coast, of, continental, europe, consisting, of, the, countries, england, scotland, and, wales, with, an, area, of, 209, 331, km, 2, 80, 823, sq, mi, it, is, the, largest, of, the, british, isles, the, largest, european, island, and, the, ninth, largest, island, in, the, world, it, is, dominated, by, a, maritime, climate, with, narrow, temperature, differences, between, seasons, the, island, of, ireland, with, an, area, 40, per, cent, that, of, great, britain, is, to, the, west, these, islands, along, with, over, 1, 000, smaller, surrounding, islands, and, named, substantial, rocks, comprise, the, british, isles, archipelago, connected, to, mainland, europe, until, 9, 000, years, ago, by, a, landbridge, now, known, as, doggerland, great, britain, has, been, inhabited, by, modern, humans, for, around, 30, 000, years, in, 2011, it, had, a, population, of, about, 61, million, making, it, the, world, s, third, most, populous, island, after, honshu, in, japan, and, java, in, indonesia, and, the, most, populated, island, outside, of, asia, the, term, great, britain, can, also, refer, to, the, political, territory, of, england, scotland, and, wales, which, includes, their, offshore, islands, this, territory, together, with, northern, ireland, constitutes, the, united, kingdom, the, archipelago, has, been, referred, to, by, a, single, name, for, over, 2000, years, the, term, british, isles, derives, from, terms, used, by, classical, geographers, to, describe, this, island, group, by, 50, bc, greek, geographers, were, using, equivalents, of, prettanik, as, a, collective, name, for, the, british, isles, however, with, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, the, latin, term, britannia, was, used, for, the, island, of, great, britain, and, later, roman, occupied, britain, south, of, caledonia, the, earliest, known, name, for, great, britain, is, albion, greek, or, insula, albionum, from, either, the, latin, albus, meaning, white, possibly, referring, to, the, white, cliffs, of, dover, the, first, view, of, britain, from, the, continent, or, the, island, of, the, albiones, the, oldest, mention, of, terms, related, to, great, britain, was, by, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, or, possibly, by, pseudo, aristotle, in, his, text, on, the, universe, vol, iii, to, quote, his, works, there, are, two, very, large, islands, in, it, called, the, british, isles, albion, and, ierne, the, first, known, written, use, of, the, word, britain, was, an, ancient, greek, transliteration, of, the, original, proto, celtic, term, in, a, work, on, the, travels, and, discoveries, of, pytheas, that, has, not, survived, the, earliest, existing, records, of, the, word, are, quotations, of, the, periplus, by, later, authors, such, as, those, within, strabo, s, geographica, pliny, s, natural, history, and, diodorus, of, sicily, s, bibliotheca, historica, pliny, the, elder, ad, 23, 79, in, his, natural, history, records, of, great, britain, its, former, name, was, albion, but, at, a, later, period, all, the, islands, of, which, we, shall, just, now, briefly, make, mention, were, included, under, the, name, of, britanni, the, name, britain, descends, from, the, latin, name, for, britain, britannia, or, britt, nia, the, land, of, the, britons, old, french, bretaigne, whence, also, modern, french, bretagne, and, middle, english, bretayne, breteyne, the, french, form, replaced, the, old, english, breoton, breoten, bryten, breten, also, breoton, lond, breten, lond, britannia, was, used, by, the, romans, from, the, 1st, century, bc, for, the, british, isles, taken, together, it, is, derived, from, the, travel, writings, of, pytheas, around, 320, bc, which, described, various, islands, in, the, north, atlantic, as, far, north, as, thule, probably, norway, the, peoples, of, these, islands, of, prettanike, were, called, the, priteni, or, pretani, priteni, is, the, source, of, the, welsh, language, term, prydain, britain, which, has, the, same, source, as, the, goidelic, term, cruithne, used, to, refer, to, the, early, brythonic, speaking, inhabitants, of, ireland, the, latter, were, later, called, picts, or, caledonians, by, the, romans, greek, historians, diodorus, of, sicily, and, strabo, preserved, variants, of, prettanike, from, the, work, of, greek, explorer, pytheas, of, massalia, who, travelled, from, his, home, in, hellenistic, southern, gaul, to, britain, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, term, used, by, pytheas, may, derive, from, a, celtic, word, meaning, the, painted, ones, or, the, tattooed, folk, in, reference, to, body, decorations, according, to, strabo, pytheas, referred, to, britain, as, bretannik, which, is, treated, a, feminine, noun, marcian, of, heraclea, in, his, periplus, maris, exteri, described, the, island, group, as, the, prettanic, isles, the, greco, egyptian, scientist, ptolemy, referred, to, the, larger, island, as, great, britain, megale, brettania, and, to, ireland, as, little, britain, mikra, brettania, in, his, work, almagest, 147, 148, ad, in, his, later, work, geography, c, 150, ad, he, gave, the, islands, the, names, alwion, iwernia, and, mona, the, isle, of, man, suggesting, these, may, have, been, the, names, of, the, individual, islands, not, known, to, him, at, the, time, of, writing, almagest, the, name, albion, appears, to, have, fallen, out, of, use, sometime, after, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, after, which, britain, became, the, more, commonplace, name, for, the, island, after, the, anglo, saxon, period, britain, was, used, as, a, historical, term, only, geoffrey, of, monmouth, in, his, pseudohistorical, historia, regum, britanniae, c, 1136, refers, to, the, island, of, great, britain, as, britannia, major, greater, britain, to, distinguish, it, from, britannia, minor, lesser, britain, the, continental, region, which, approximates, to, modern, brittany, and, had, been, settled, in, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, by, celtic, briton, migrants, from, great, britain, the, term, great, britain, was, first, used, officially, in, 1474, in, the, instrument, drawing, up, the, proposal, for, a, marriage, between, cecily, daughter, of, edward, iv, of, england, and, james, son, of, james, iii, of, scotland, which, described, it, as, this, nobill, isle, callit, gret, britanee, the, scottish, philosopher, and, historian, john, major, mair, published, his, history, of, great, britain, both, england, and, scotland,

of, man, and, the, channel, islands, the, political, union, which, joined, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, scotland, occurred, in, 1707, when, the, acts, of, union, ratified, the, 1706, treaty, of, union, and, merged, the, parliaments, of, the, two, nations, forming, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, which, covered, the, entire, island, before, this, a, personal, union, had, existed, between, these, two, countries, since, the, 1603, union, of, the, crowns, under, james, vi, of, scotland, and, i, of, england, the, oldest, evidence, for, archaic, humans, in, britain, are, the, happisburgh, footprints, and, associated, stone, tools, found, in, norfolk, dating, to, around, 950, 850, 000, years, ago, prior, to, 450, 000, years, ago, britain, formed, a, peninsular, extension, of, mainland, europe, until, catastrophic, flooding, between, then, and, 130, 000, years, ago, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, english, channel, and, britain, becoming, an, island, during, warm, interglacial, periods, like, the, last, interglacial, eemian, 130, 115, 000, years, ago, though, it, remained, connected, to, mainland, europe, during, glacial, periods, when, sea, levels, were, low, archaic, humans, repeatedly, occupied, britain, before, abandoning, the, area, during, cooler, periods, modern, humans, arrived, in, britain, about, 40, 000, years, ago, as, evidenced, by, remains, found, in, kents, cavern, in, devon, following, the, disappearance, of, neanderthals, prior, to, 9, 000, years, ago, britain, retained, a, land, connection, to, the, continent, with, an, area, of, mostly, low, marshland, doggerland, joining, it, to, what, are, now, denmark, and, the, netherlands, during, the, mesolithic, period, britain, was, inhabited, by, hunter, gatherers, neolithic, farmers, of, anatolian, origin, arrived, in, britain, around, 4000, bc, replacing, the, pre, existing, hunter, gatherers, around, 2000, bc, the, bronze, age, bell, beaker, culture, arrived, in, britain, which, genetic, evidence, suggests, was, associated, with, another, episode, of, nearly, complete, population, replacement, later, significant, migration, to, southern, britain, around, 1000, bc, may, have, brought, the, celtic, languages, to, the, island, during, the, iron, age, britain, was, inhabited, by, various, different, celtic, tribes, the, romans, conquered, most, of, the, island, up, to, hadrian, s, wall, in, northern, england, and, this, became, the, ancient, roman, province, of, britannia, in, the, course, of, the, 500, years, after, the, roman, empire, fell, the, britons, of, the, south, and, east, of, the, island, were, assimilated, or, displaced, by, invading, germanic, tribes, angles, saxons, and, jutes, often, referred, to, collectively, as, anglo, saxons, at, about, the, same, time, gaelic, tribes, from, ireland, invaded, the, north, west, absorbing, both, the, picts, and, britons, of, northern, britain, eventually, forming, the, kingdom, of, scotland, in, the, 9th, century, the, south, east, of, scotland, was, colonised, by, the, angles, and, formed, until, 1018, a, part, of, the, kingdom, of, northumbria, ultimately, the, population, of, south, east, britain, came, to, be, referred, to, as, the, english, people, so, named, after, the, angles, germanic, speakers, referred, to, britons, as, welsh, this, term, came, to, be, applied, exclusively, to, the, inhabitants, of, what, is, now, wales, but, it, also, survives, in, names, such, as, wallace, and, in, the, second, syllable, of, cornwall, cymry, a, name, the, britons, used, to, describe, themselves, is, similarly, restricted, in, modern, welsh, to, people, from, wales, but, also, survives, in, english, in, the, place, name, of, cumbria, the, britons, living, in, the, areas, now, known, as, wales, cumbria, and, cornwall, were, not, assimilated, by, the, germanic, tribes, a, fact, reflected, in, the, survival, of, celtic, languages, in, these, areas, into, more, recent, times, at, the, time, of, the, germanic, invasion, of, southern, britain, many, britons, emigrated, to, the, area, now, known, as, brittany, where, breton, a, celtic, language, closely, related, to, welsh, and, cornish, and, descended, from, the, language, of, the, emigrants, is, still, spoken, in, the, 9th, century, a, series, of, danish, assaults, on, northern, english, kingdoms, led, to, them, coming, under, danish, control, an, area, known, as, the, danelaw, in, the, 10th, century, however, all, the, english, kingdoms, were, unified, under, one, ruler, as, the, kingdom, of, england, when, the, last, constituent, kingdom, northumbria, submitted, to, edgar, in, 959, in, 1066, england, was, conquered, by, the, normans, who, introduced, a, norman, speaking, administration, that, was, eventually, assimilated, wales, came, under, anglo, norman, control, in, 1282, and, was, officially, annexed, to, england, in, the, 16th, century, on, 20, october, 1604, king, james, who, had, succeeded, separately, to, the, two, thrones, of, england, and, scotland, proclaimed, himself, king, of, great, brittaine, france, and, ireland, when, james, died, in, 1625, and, the, privy, council, of, england, was, drafting, the, proclamation, of, the, new, king, charles, i, a, scottish, peer, thomas, erskine, 1st, earl, of, kellie, succeeded, in, insisting, that, it, use, the, phrase, king, of, great, britain, which, james, had, preferred, rather, than, king, of, scotland, and, england, or, vice, versa, while, that, title, was, also, used, by, some, of, james, s, successors, england, and, scotland, each, remained, legally, separate, countries, each, with, its, own, parliament, until, 1707, when, each, parliament, passed, an, act, of, union, to, ratify, the, treaty, of, union, that, had, been, agreed, the, previous, year, this, created, a, single, kingdom, with, one, parliament, with, effect, from, 1, may, 1707, the, treaty, of, union, specified, the, name, of, the, new, all, island, state, as, great, britain, while, describing, it, as, one, kingdom, and, the, united, kingdom, to, most, historians, therefore, the, all, island, state, that, existed, between, 1707, and, 1800, is, either, great, britain, or, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, great, britain, lies, on, the, european, continental, shelf, part, of, the, eurasian, plate, and, off, the, north, west, coast, of, continental, europe, separated, from, this, european, mainland, by, the, north, sea, and, by, the, english, channel, which, narrows, to, 34, km, 18, nmi, 21, mi, at, the, straits, of, dover, it, stretches, over, about, ten, degrees, of, latitude, on, its, longer, north, south, axis, and, covers, 209, 331, km, 2, 80, 823, sq, mi, excluding, the, much, smaller, surrounding, islands, the, north, channel, irish, sea, st, george, s, channel, and, celtic, sea, separate, the, island, from, the, island, of, ireland, to, its, west, the, island, is, since, 1993, joined, via, one, structure, with, continental, europe, the, channel, tunnel, the, longest, undersea, rail, tunnel, in, the, world, the, island, is, marked, by, low, rolling, countryside, in, the, east, and, south, while, hills, and, mountains, predominate, in, the, western, and, northern, regions, it, is, surrounded, by, over, 1, 000, smaller, islands, and, islets, the, greatest, distance, between, two, points, is, 968, 0, km, 601, 1, 2, mi, between, land, s, end, cornwall, and, john, o, groats, caithness, 838, miles, 1, 349, km, by, road, the, english, channel, is, thought, to, have, been, created, between, 450, 000, and, 180, 000, years, ago, by, two, catastrophic, glacial, lake, outburst, floods, caused, by, the, breaching, of, the, weald, artois, anticline, a, ridge, that, held, back, a, large, proglacial, lake, now, submerged, under, the, north, sea, around, 10, 000, years, ago, during, the, devensian, glaciation, with, its, lower, sea, level, great, britain, was, not, an, island, but, an, upland, region, of, continental, north, western, europe, lying, partially, underneath, the, eurasian, ice, sheet, the, sea, level, was, about, 120, metres, 390, ft, lower, than, today, and, the, bed, of, the, north, sea, was, dry, and, acted, as, a, land, bridge, now, known, as, doggerland, to, the, continent, it, is, generally, thought, that, as, sea, levels, gradually, rose, after, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, of, the, current, ice, age, doggerland, reflooded, cutting, off, what, was, the, british, peninsula, from, the, european, mainland, by, around, 6500, bc, great, britain, has, been, subject, to, a, variety, of, plate, tectonic, processes, over, a, very, extended, period, of, time, changing, latitude, and, sea, levels, have, been, important, factors, in, the, nature, of, sedimentary, sequences, whilst, successive, continental, collisions, have, affected, its, geological, structure, with, major, faulting, and, folding, being, a, legacy, of, each, orogeny, mountain, building, period, often, associated, with, volcanic, activity, and, the, metamorphism, of, existing, rock, sequences, as, a, result, of, this, eventful, geological, history, the, island, shows, a, rich, variety, of, landscapes, the, oldest, rocks, in, great, britain, are, the, lewisian, gneisses, metamorphic, rocks, found, in, the, far, north, west, of, the, island, and, in, the, hebrides, with, a, few, small, outcrops, elsewhere, which, date, from, at, least, 2, 700, my, ago, south, of, the, gneisses, are, a, complex, mixture, of, rocks, forming, the, north, west, highlands, and, grampian, highlands, in, scotland, these, are, essentially, the, remains, of, folded, sedimentary, rocks, that, were, deposited, between, 1, 000, my, and, 670, my, ago, over, the, gneiss, on, what, was, then, the, floor, of, the, iapetus, ocean, in, the, current, era, the, north, of, the, island, is, rising, as, a, result, of, the, weight, of, devensian, ice, being, lifted, counterbalanced, the, south, and, east, is, sinking, generally, estimated, at, 1, mm, 1, 25, inch, per, year, with, the, london, area, sinking, at, double, this, partly, due, to, the, continuing, compaction, of, the, recent, clay, deposits, animal, diversity, is, modest, as, a, result, of, factors, including, the, island, s, small, land, area, the, relatively, recent, age, of, the, habitats, developed, since, the, last, glacial, period, and, the, island, s, physical, separation, from, continental, europe, and, the, effects, of, seasonal, variability, great, britain, also, experienced, early, industrialisation, and, is, subject, to, continuing, urbanisation, which, have, contributed, towards, the, overall, loss, of, species, a, defra, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, study, from, 2006, suggested, that, 100, species, have, become, extinct, in, the, uk, during, the, 20th, century, about, 100, times, the, background, extinction, rate, however, some, species, such, as, the, brown, rat, red, fox, and, introduced, grey, squirrel, are, well, adapted, to, urban, areas, rodents, make, up, 40, of, the, mammal, species, these, include, squirrels, mice, voles, rats, and, the, recently, reintroduced, european, beaver, there, is, also, an, abundance, of, european, rabbit, european, hare, shrews, european, mole, and, several, species, of, bat, carnivorous, mammals, include, the, red,

the, largest, land, based, wild, animals, today, are, deer, the, red, deer, is, the, largest, species, with, roe, deer, and, fallow, deer, also, prominent, the, latter, was, introduced, by, the, normans, sika, deer, and, two, more, species, of, smaller, deer, muntjac, and, chinese, water, deer, have, been, introduced, muntjac, becoming, widespread, in, england, and, parts, of, wales, while,
