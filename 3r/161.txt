nile, the, headwaters, of, the, apur, mac, river, on, nevado, mismi, had, been, considered, for, nearly, a, century, the, amazon, basin, s, most, distant, source, until, a, 2014, study, found, it, to, be, the, headwaters, of, the, mantaro, river, on, the, cordillera, rumi, cruz, in, peru, the, mantaro, and, apur, mac, rivers, join, and, with, other, tributaries, form, the, ucayali, river, which, in, turn, meets, the, mara, n, river, upstream, of, iquitos, peru, forming, what, countries, other, than, brazil, consider, to, be, the, main, stem, of, the, amazon, brazilians, call, this, section,

amazon, represents, 20, of, the, global, riverine, discharge, into, oceans, the, amazon, basin, is, the, largest, drainage, basin, in, the, world, with, an, area, of, approximately, 7, 000, 000, km, 2, 2, 700, 000, sq, mi, the, portion, of, the, river, s, drainage, basin, in, brazil, alone, is, larger, than, any, other, river, s, basin, the, amazon, enters, brazil, with, only, one, fifth, of, the, flow, it, finally, discharges, into, the, atlantic, ocean, yet, already, has, a, greater, flow, at, this, point, than, the, discharge, of, any, other, river, in, the, world, the, amazon, was, initially, known, by, europeans, as, the, mara, n, and, the, peruvian, part, of, the, river, is, still, known, by, that, name, as, well, as, the, brazilian, state, of, maranh, o, which, contains, part, of, the, amazon, it, later, became, known, as, rio, amazonas, in, spanish, and, portuguese, the, name, rio, amazonas, was, reportedly, given, after, native, warriors, attacked, a, 16th, century, expedition, by, francisco, de, orellana, the, warriors, were, led, by, women, reminding, de, orellana, of, the, amazon, warriors, a, tribe, of, women, warriors, related, to, iranian, scythians, and, sarmatians, mentioned, in, greek, mythology, the, word, amazon, itself, may, be, derived, from, the, iranian, compound, ha, maz, an, one, fighting, together, or, ethnonym, ha, mazan, warriors, a, word, attested, indirectly, through, a, derivation, a, denominal, verb, in, hesychius, of, alexandria, s, gloss, hamazakaran, to, make, war, in, persian, where, it, appears, together, with, the, indo, iranian, root, kar, make, from, which, sanskrit, karma, is, also, derived, other, scholars, claim, that, the, name, is, derived, from, the, tupi, word, amassona, meaning, boat, destroyer, recent, geological, studies, suggest, that, for, millions, of, years, the, amazon, river, used, to, flow, in, the, opposite, direction, from, east, to, west, eventually, the, andes, mountains, formed, blocking, its, flow, to, the, pacific, ocean, and, causing, it, to, switch, directions, to, its, current, mouth, in, the, atlantic, ocean, during, what, many, archaeologists, called, the, formative, stage, amazonian, societies, were, deeply, involved, in, the, emergence, of, south, america, s, highland, agrarian, systems, the, trade, with, andean, civilizations, in, the, terrains, of, the, headwaters, in, the, andes, formed, an, essential, contribution, to, the, social, and, religious, development, of, higher, altitude, civilizations, like, the, muisca, and, incas, early, human, settlements, were, typically, based, on, low, lying, hills, or, mounds, shell, mounds, were, the, earliest, evidence, of, habitation, they, represent, piles, of, human, refuse, waste, and, are, mainly, dated, between, 7500, bc, and, 4000, bc, they, are, associated, with, ceramic, age, cultures, no, preceramic, shell, mounds, have, been, documented, so, far, by, archaeologists, artificial, earth, platforms, for, entire, villages, are, the, second, type, of, mounds, they, are, best, represented, by, the, marajoara, culture, figurative, mounds, are, the, most, recent, types, of, occupation, there, is, ample, evidence, that, the, areas, surrounding, the, amazon, river, were, home, to, complex, and, large, scale, indigenous, societies, mainly, chiefdoms, who, developed, towns, and, cities, archaeologists, estimate, that, by, the, time, the, spanish, conquistador, de, orellana, traveled, across, the, amazon, in, 1541, more, than, 3, million, indigenous, people, lived, around, the, amazon, these, pre, columbian, settlements, created, highly, developed, civilizations, for, instance, pre, columbian, indigenous, people, on, the, island, of, maraj, may, have, developed, social, stratification, and, supported, a, population, of, 100, 000, people, to, achieve, this, level, of, development, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, the, amazon, rainforest, altered, the, forest, s, ecology, by, selective, cultivation, and, the, use, of, fire, scientists, argue, that, by, burning, areas, of, the, forest, repeatedly, the, indigenous, people, caused, the, soil, to, become, richer, in, nutrients, this, created, dark, soil, areas, known, as, terra, preta, de, ndio, indian, dark, earth, because, of, the, terra, preta, indigenous, communities, were, able, to, make, land, fertile, and, thus, sustainable, for, the, large, scale, agriculture, needed, to, support, their, large, populations, and, complex, social, structures, further, research, has, hypothesized, that, this, practice, began, around, 11, 000, years, ago, some, say, that, its, effects, on, forest, ecology, and, regional, climate, explain, the, otherwise, inexplicable, band, of, lower, rainfall, through, the, amazon, basin, many, indigenous, tribes, engaged, in, constant, warfare, according, to, james, s, olson, the, munduruku, expansion, in, the, 18th, century, dislocated, and, displaced, the, kawah, b, breaking, the, tribe, down, into, much, smaller, groups, first, came, to, the, attention, of, europeans, in, 1770, when, they, began, a, series, of, widespread, attacks, on, brazilian, settlements, along, the, amazon, river, in, march, 1500, spanish, conquistador, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, was, the, first, documented, european, to, sail, up, the, amazon, river, pinz, n, called, the, stream, r, o, santa, mar, a, del, mar, dulce, later, shortened, to, mar, dulce, literally, sweet, sea, because, of, its, freshwater, pushing, out, into, the, ocean, another, spanish, explorer, francisco, de, orellana, was, the, first, european, to, travel, from, the, origins, of, the, upstream, river, basins, situated, in, the, andes, to, the, mouth, of, the, river, in, this, journey, orellana, baptized, some, of, the, affluents, of, the, amazonas, like, rio, negro, napo, and, jurua, the, name, amazonas, is, thought, to, be, taken, from, the, native, warriors, that, attacked, this, expedition, mostly, women, that, reminded, de, orellana, of, the, mythical, female, amazon, warriors, from, the, ancient, hellenic, culture, in, greece, see, also, origin, of, the, name, gonzalo, pizarro, set, off, in, 1541, to, explore, east, of, quito, into, the, south, american, interior, in, search, of, el, dorado, the, city, of, gold, and, la, canela, the, valley, of, cinnamon, he, was, accompanied, by, his, second, in, command, francisco, de, orellana, after, 170, km, 106, mi, the, coca, river, joined, the, napo, river, at, a, point, now, known, as, puerto, francisco, de, orellana, the, party, stopped, for, a, few, weeks, to, build, a, boat, just, upriver, from, this, confluence, they, continued, downriver, through, an, uninhabited, area, where, they, could, not, find, food, orellana, offered, and, was, ordered, to, follow, the, napo, river, then, known, as, r, o, de, la, canela, cinnamon, river, and, return, with, food, for, the, party, based, on, intelligence, received, from, a, captive, native, chief, named, delicola, they, expected, to, find, food, within, a, few, days, downriver, by, ascending, another, river, to, the, north, de, orellana, took, about, 57, men, the, boat, and, some, canoes, and, left, pizarro, s, troops, on, 26, december, 1541, however, de, orellana, missed, the, confluence, probably, with, the, aguarico, where, he, was, searching, supplies, for, his, men, by, the, time, he, and, his, men, reached, another, village, many, of, them, were, sick, from, hunger, and, eating, noxious, plants, and, near, death, seven, men, died, in, that, village, his, men, threatened, to, mutiny, if, the, expedition, turned, back, to, attempt, to, rejoin, pizarro, the, party, being, over, 100, leagues, downstream, at, this, point, he, accepted, to, change, the, purpose, of, the, expedition, to, discover, new, lands, in, the, name, of, the, king, of, spain, and, the, men, built, a, larger, boat, in, which, to, navigate, downstream, after, a, journey, of, 600, km, 370, mi, down, the, napo, river, they, reached, a, further, major, confluence, at, a, point, near, modern, iquitos, and, then, followed, the, upper, amazon, now, known, as, the, solim, es, for, a, further, 1, 200, km, 746, mi, to, its, confluence, with, the, rio, negro, near, modern, manaus, which, they, reached, on, 3, june, 1542, regarding, the, initial, mission, of, finding, cinnamon, pizarro, reported, to, the, king, that, they, had, found, cinnamon, trees, but, that, they, could, not, be, profitably, harvested, true, cinnamon, cinnamomum, verum, is, not, native, to, south, america, other, related, cinnamon, containing, plants, of, the, family, lauraceae, are, fairly, common, in, that, part, of, the, amazon, and, pizarro, probably, saw, some, of, these, the, expedition, reached, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, on, 24, august, 1542, demonstrating, the, practical, navigability, of, the, great, river, in, 1560, another, spanish, conquistador, lope, de, aguirre, may, have, made, the, second, descent, of, the, amazon, historians, are, uncertain, whether, the, river, he, descended, was, the, amazon, or, the, orinoco, river, which, runs, more, or, less, parallel, to, the, amazon, further, north, portuguese, explorer, pedro, teixeira, was, the, first, european, to, travel, up, the, entire, river, he, arrived, in, quito, in, 1637, and, returned, via, the, same, route, from, 1648, to, 1652, portuguese, brazilian, bandeirante, ant, nio, raposo, tavares, led, an, expedition, from, s, o, paulo, overland, to, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, investigating, many, of, its, tributaries, including, the, rio, negro, and, covering, a, distance, of, over, 10, 000, km, 6, 200, mi, in, what, is, currently, in, brazil, ecuador, bolivia, colombia, peru, and, venezuela, several, colonial, and, religious, settlements, were, established, along, the, banks, of, primary, rivers, and, tributaries, for, trade, slaving, and, evangelization, among, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, vast, rainforest, such, as, the, urarina, in, the, late, 1600s, czech, jesuit, father, samuel, fritz, an, apostle, of, the, omagus, established, some, forty, mission, villages, fritz, proposed, that, the, mara, n, river, must, be, the, source, of, the, amazon, noting, on, his, 1707, map, that, the, mara, n, has, its, source, on, the, southern, shore, of, a, lake, that, is, called, lauricocha, near, hu, nuco, fritz, reasoned, that, the, mara, n, is, the, largest, river, branch, one, encounters, when, journeying, upstream, and, lies, farther, to, the, west, than, any, other, tributary, of, the, amazon, for, most, of, the, 18th, 19th, centuries, and, into, the, 20th, century, the, mara, n, was, generally, considered, the, source, of, the, amazon, early, scientific, zoological, and, botanical, exploration, of, the, amazon, river, and, basin, took, place, from, the, 18th, century, through, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, cabanagem, revolt, 1835, 1840, was, directed, against, the, white, ruling, class, it, is, estimated, that, from, 30, to, 40, of, the, population, of, gr, o, par, estimated, at, 100, 000, people, died, the, population, of, the, brazilian, portion, of, the, amazon, basin, in, 1850, was, perhaps, 300, 000, of, whom, about, 175, 000, were, europeans, and, 25, 000, were, slaves, the, brazilian, amazon, s, principal, commercial, city, par, now, bel, m, had, from, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, inhabitants, including, slaves, the, town, of, man, os, now, manaus, at, the, mouth, of, the, rio, negro, had, a, population, between, 1, 000, and, 1, 500, all, the, remaining, villages, as, far, up, as, tabatinga, on, the, brazilian, frontier, of, peru, were, relatively, small, on, 6, september, 1850, emperor, pedro, ii, of, brazil, sanctioned, a, law, authorizing, steam, navigation, on, the, amazon, and, gave, the, viscount, of, mau, irineu, evangelista, de, sousa, the, task, of, putting, it, into, effect, he, organised, the, companhia, de, navega, o, e, com, rcio, do, amazonas, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, 1852, in, the, following, year, it, commenced, operations, with, four, small, steamers, the, monarca, monarch, the, camet, the, maraj, and, the, rio, negro, at, first, navigation, was, principally, confined, to, the, main, river, and, even, in, 1857, a, modification, of, the, government, contract, only, obliged, the, company, to, a, monthly, service, between, par, and, manaus, with, steamers, of, 200, tons, cargo, capacity, a, second, line, to, make, six, round, voyages, a, year, between, manaus, and, tabatinga, and, a, third, two, trips, a, month, between, par, and, camet, this, was, the, first, step, in, opening, up, the, vast, interior, the, success, of, the, venture, called, attention, to, the, opportunities, for, economic, exploitation, of, the, amazon, and, a, second, company, soon, opened, commerce, on, the, madeira, pur, s, and, negro, a, third, established, a, line, between, par, and, manaus, and, a, fourth, found, it, profitable, to, navigate, some, of, the, smaller, streams, in, that, same, period, the, amazonas, company, was, increasing, its, fleet, meanwhile, private, individuals, were, building, and, running, small, steam, craft, of, their, own, on, the, main, river, as, well, as, on, many, of, its, tributaries, on, 31, july, 1867, the, government, of, brazil, constantly, pressed, by, the, maritime, powers, and, by, the, countries, encircling, the, upper, amazon, basin, especially, peru, decreed, the, opening, of, the, amazon, to, all, countries, but, they, limited, this, to, certain, defined, points, tabatinga, on, the, amazon, camet, on, the, tocantins, santar, m, on, the, tapaj, s, borba, on, the, madeira, and, manaus, on, the, rio, negro, the, brazilian, decree, took, effect, on, 7, september, 1867, thanks, in, part, to, the, mercantile, development, associated, with, steamboat, navigation, coupled, with, the, internationally, driven, demand, for, natural, rubber, the, peruvian, city, of, iquitos, became, a, thriving, cosmopolitan, center, of, commerce, foreign, companies, settled, in, iquitos, from, where, they, controlled, the, extraction, of, rubber, in, 1851, iquitos, had, a, population, of, 200, and, by, 1900, its, population, reached, 20, 000, in, the, 1860s, approximately, 3, 000, tons, of, rubber, were, being, exported, annually, and, by, 1911, annual, exports, had, grown, to, 44, 000, tons, representing, 9, 3, of, peru, s, exports, during, the, rubber, boom, it, is, estimated, that, diseases, brought, by, immigrants, such, as, typhus, and, malaria, killed, 40, 000, native, amazonians, the, first, direct, foreign, trade, with, manaus, commenced, around, 1874, local, trade, along, the, river, was, carried, on, by, the, english, successors, to, the, amazonas, company, the, amazon, steam, navigation, company, as, well, as, numerous, small, steamboats, belonging, to, companies, and, firms, engaged, in, the, rubber, trade, navigating, the, negro, madeira, pur, s, and, many, other, tributaries, such, as, the, mara, n, to, ports, as, distant, as, nauta, peru, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, exports, of, the, amazon, basin, were, india, rubber, cacao, beans, brazil, nuts, and, a, few, other, products, of, minor, importance, such, as, pelts, and, exotic, forest, produce, resins, barks, woven, hammocks, prized, bird, feathers, live, animals, and, extracted, goods, such, as, lumber, and, gold, since, colonial, times, the, portuguese, portion, of, the, amazon, basin, has, remained, a, land, largely, undeveloped, by, agriculture, and, occupied, by, indigenous, people, who, survived, the, arrival, of, european, diseases, four, centuries, after, the, european, discovery, of, the, amazon, river, the, total, cultivated, area, in, its, basin, was, probably, less, than, 65, km, 2, 25, sq, mi, excluding, the, limited, and, crudely, cultivated, areas, among, the, mountains, at, its, extreme, headwaters, this, situation, changed, dramatically, during, the, 20th, century, wary, of, foreign, exploitation, of, the, nation, s, resources, brazilian, governments, in, the, 1940s, set, out, to, develop, the, interior, away, from, the, seaboard, where, foreigners, owned, large, tracts, of, land, the, original, architect, of, this, expansion, was, president, get, lio, vargas, with, the, demand, for, rubber, from, the, allied, forces, in, world, war, ii, providing, funding, for, the, drive, in, the, 1960s, economic, exploitation, of, the, amazon, basin, was, seen, as, a, way, to, fuel, the, economic, miracle, occurring, at, the, time, this, resulted, in, the, development, of, operation, amazon, an, economic, development, project, that, brought, large, scale, agriculture, and, ranching, to, amazonia, this, was, done, through, a, combination, of, credit, and, fiscal, incentives, however, in, the, 1970s, the, government, took, a, new, approach, with, the, national, integration, program, pin, a, large, scale, colonization, program, saw, families, from, northeastern, brazil, relocated, to, the, land, without, people, in, the, amazon, basin, this, was, done, in, conjunction, with, infrastructure, projects, mainly, the, trans, amazonian, highway, transamaz, nica, the, trans, amazonian, highway, s, three, pioneering, highways, were, completed, within, ten, years, but, never, fulfilled, their, promise, large, portions, of, the, trans, amazonian, and, its, accessory, roads, such, as, br, 317, manaus, porto, velho, are, derelict, and, impassable, in, the, rainy, season, small, towns, and, villages, are, scattered, across, the, forest, and, because, its, vegetation, is, so, dense, some, remote, areas, are, still, unexplored, many, settlements, grew, along, the, road, from, bras, lia, to, bel, m, with, the, highway, and, national, integration, program, however, the, program, failed, as, the, settlers, were, unequipped, to, live, in, the, delicate, rainforest, ecosystem, this, although, the, government, believed, it, could, sustain, millions, instead, could, sustain, very, few, with, a, population, of, 1, 9, million, people, in, 2014, manaus, is, the, largest, city, on, the, amazon, manaus, alone, makes, up, approximately, 50, of, the, population, of, the, largest, brazilian, state, of, amazonas, the, racial, makeup, of, the, city, is, 64, pardo, mulatto, and, mestizo, and, 32, white, although, the, amazon, river, remains, undammed, around, 412, dams, are, in, operation, on, the, amazon, s, tributary, rivers, of, these, 412, dams, 151, are, constructed, over, six, of, the, main, tributary, rivers, that, drain, into, the, amazon, since, only, 4, of, the, amazon, s, hydropower, potential, has, been, developed, in, countries, like, brazil, more, damming, projects, are, underway, and, hundreds, more, are, planned, after, witnessing, the, negative, effects, of, environmental, degradation, sedimentation, navigation, and, flood, control, caused, by, the, three, gorges, dam, in, the, yangtze, river, scientists, are, worried, that, constructing, more, dams, in, the, amazon, will, harm, its, biodiversity, in, the, same, way, by, blocking, fish, spawning, runs, reducing, the, flows, of, vital, oil, nutrients, and, clearing, forests, damming, the, amazon, river, could, potentially, bring, about, the, end, of, free, flowing, rivers, and, contribute, to, an, ecosystem, collapse, that, will, cause, major, social, and, environmental, problems, the, most, distant, source, of, the, amazon, was, thought, to, be, in, the, apur, mac, river, drainage, for, nearly, a, century, such, studies, continued, to, be, published, even, as, recently, as, 1996, 2001, 2007, and, 2008, where, various, authors, identified, the, snowcapped, 5, 597, m, 18, 363, ft, nevado, mismi, peak, located, roughly, 160, km, 99, mi, west, of, lake, titicaca, and, 700, km, 430, mi, southeast, of, lima, as, the, most, distant, source, of, the, river, from, that, point, quebrada, carhuasanta, emerges, from, nevado, mismi, joins, quebrada, apacheta, and, soon, forms, r, o, lloqueta, which, becomes, r, o, hornillos, and, eventually, joins, the, r, o, apur, mac, a, 2014, study, by, americans, james, contos, and, nicolas, tripcevich, in, area, a, peer, reviewed, journal, of, the, royal, geographical, society, however, identifies, the, most, distant, source, of, the, amazon, as, actually, being, in, the, r, o, mantaro, drainage, a, variety, of, methods, were, used, to, compare, the, lengths, of, the, mantaro, river, vs, the, apur, mac, river, from, their, most, distant, source, points, to, their, confluence, showing, the, longer, length, of, the, mantaro, then, distances, from, lago, jun, n, to, several, potential, source, points, in, the, uppermost, mantaro, river, were, measured, which, enabled, them, to, determine, that, the, cordillera, rumi, cruz, was, the, most, distant, source, of, water, in, the, mantaro, basin, and, therefore, in, the, entire, amazon, basin, the, most, accurate, measurement, method, was, direct, gps, measurement, obtained, by, kayak, descent, of, each, of, the, rivers, from, their, source, points, to, their, confluence, performed, by, contos, obtaining, these, measurements, was, difficult, given, the, class, iv, v, nature, of, each, of, these, rivers, especially, in, their, lower, abyss, sections, ultimately, they, determined, that, the, most, distant, point, in, the, mantaro, drainage, is, nearly, 80, km, farther, upstream, compared, to, mt, mismi, in, the, apur, mac, drainage, and, thus, the, maximal, length, of, the, amazon, river, is, about, 80, km, longer, than, previously, thought, contos, continued, downstream, to, the, ocean, and, finished, the, first, complete, descent, of, the, amazon, river, from, its, newly, identified, source, finishing, november, 2012, a, journey, repeated, by, two, groups, after, the, news, spread, after, about, 700, km, 430, mi, the, apur, mac, then, joins, r, o, mantaro, to, form, the, ene, which, joins, the, perene, to, form, the, tambo, which, joins, the, urubamba, river, to, form, the,

the, mara, n, some, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, the, forested, banks, are, just, above, the, water, and, are, inundated, long, before, the, river, attains, its, maximum, flood, stage, the, low, river, banks, are, interrupted, by, only, a, few, hills, and, the, river, enters, the, enormous, amazon, rainforest, although, the, ucayali, mara, n, confluence, is, the, point, at, which, most, geographers, place, the, beginning, of, the, amazon, river, proper, in, brazil, the, river, is, known, at, this, point, as, the, solim, es, das, guas, the, river, systems, and, flood, plains, in, brazil, peru, ecuador, colombia, and, venezuela, whose, waters, drain, into, the, solim, es, and, its, tributaries, are, called, the, upper, amazon, the, amazon, proper, runs, mostly, through, brazil, and, peru, and, is, part, of, the, border, between, colombia, and, peru, it, has, a, series, of, major, tributaries, in, colombia, ecuador, and, peru, some, of, which, flow, into, the, mara, n, and, ucayali, and, others, directly, into, the, amazon, proper, these, include, rivers, putumayo, caquet, vaup, s, guain, a, morona, pastaza, nucuray, urituyacu, chambira, tigre, nanay, napo, and, huallaga, at, some, points, the, river, divides, into, anabranches, or, multiple, channels, often, very, long, with, inland, and, lateral, channels, all, connected, by, a, complicated, system, of, natural, canals, cutting, the, low, flat, igap, lands, which, are, never, more, than, 5, m, 16, ft, above, low, river, into, many, islands, from, the, town, of, canaria, at, the, great, bend, of, the, amazon, to, the, negro, vast, areas, of, land, are, submerged, at, high, water, above, which, only, the, upper, part, of, the, trees, of, the, sombre, forests, appear, near, the, mouth, of, the, rio, negro, to, serpa, nearly, opposite, the, river, madeira, the, banks, of, the, amazon, are, low, until, approaching, manaus, they, rise, to, become, rolling, hills, the, lower, amazon, begins, where, the, darkly, colored, waters, of, the, rio, negro, meets, the, sandy, colored, rio, solim, es, the, upper, amazon, and, for, over, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, these, waters, run, side, by, side, without, mixing, at, bidos, a, bluff, 17, m, 56, ft, above, the, river, is, backed, by, low, hills, the, lower, amazon, seems, to, have, once, been, a, gulf, of, the, atlantic, ocean, the, waters, of, which, washed, the, cliffs, near, bidos, only, about, 10, of, the, amazon, s, water, enters, downstream, of, bidos, very, little, of, which, is, from, the, northern, slope, of, the, valley, the, drainage, area, of, the, amazon, basin, above, bidos, city, is, about, 5, 000, 000, km, 2, 1, 900, 000, sq, mi, and, below, only, about, 1, 000, 000, km, 2, 390, 000, sq, mi, around, 20, exclusive, of, the, 1, 400, 000, km, 2, 540, 000, sq, mi, of, the, tocantins, basin, the, tocantins, river, enters, the, southern, portion, of, the, amazon, delta, in, the, lower, reaches, of, the, river, the, north, bank, consists, of, a, series, of, steep, table, topped, hills, extending, for, about, 240, km, 150, mi, from, opposite, the, mouth, of, the, xingu, as, far, as, monte, alegre, these, hills, are, cut, down, to, a, kind, of, terrace, which, lies, between, them, and, the, river, on, the, south, bank, above, the, xingu, a, line, of, low, bluffs, bordering, the, floodplain, extends, nearly, to, santar, m, in, a, series, of, gentle, curves, before, they, bend, to, the, southwest, and, abutting, upon, the, lower, tapaj, s, merge, into, the, bluffs, which, form, the, terrace, margin, of, the, tapaj, s, river, valley, bel, m, is, the, major, city, and, port, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, at, the, atlantic, ocean, the, definition, of, where, exactly, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, is, located, and, how, wide, it, is, is, a, matter, of, dispute, because, of, the, area, s, peculiar, geography, the, par, and, the, amazon, are, connected, by, a, series, of, river, channels, called, furos, near, the, town, of, breves, between, them, lies, maraj, the, world, s, largest, combined, river, sea, island, if, the, par, river, and, the, maraj, island, ocean, frontage, are, included, the, amazon, estuary, is, some, 325, km, 202, mi, wide, in, this, case, the, width, of, the, mouth, of, the, river, is, usually, measured, from, cabo, norte, the, cape, located, straight, east, of, pracu, ba, in, the, brazilian, state, of, amap, to, ponta, da, tijoca, near, the, town, of, curu, in, the, state, of, par, a, more, conservative, measurement, excluding, the, par, river, estuary, from, the, mouth, of, the, araguari, river, to, ponta, do, navio, on, the, northern, coast, of, maraj, would, still, give, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, a, width, of, over, 180, km, 112, mi, if, only, the, river, s, main, channel, is, considered, between, the, islands, of, curu, state, of, amap, and, jurupari, state, of, par, the, width, falls, to, about, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, the, plume, generated, by, the, river, s, discharge, covers, up, to, 1, 3, million, km, 2, and, is, responsible, for, muddy, bottoms, influencing, a, wide, area, of, the, tropical, north, atlantic, in, terms, of, salinity, ph, light, penetration, and, sedimentation, there, are, no, bridges, across, the, entire, width, of, the, river, this, is, not, because, the, river, would, be, too, wide, to, bridge, for, most, of, its, length, engineers, could, build, a, bridge, across, the, river, easily, for, most, of, its, course, the, river, flows, through, the, amazon, rainforest, where, there, are, very, few, roads, and, cities, most, of, the, time, the, crossing, can, be, done, by, a, ferry, the, manaus, iranduba, bridge, linking, the, cities, of, manaus, and, iranduba, spans, the, rio, negro, the, second, largest, tributary, of, the, amazon, just, before, their, confluence, while, debate, as, to, whether, the, amazon, or, the, nile, is, the, world, s, longest, river, has, gone, on, for, many, years, the, historic, consensus, of, geographic, authorities, has, been, to, regard, the, amazon, as, the, second, longest, river, in, the, world, with, the, nile, being, the, longest, however, the, amazon, has, been, reported, as, being, anywhere, between, 6, 275, km, 3, 899, mi, and, 6, 992, km, 4, 345, mi, long, it, is, often, said, to, be, at, least, 6, 575, km, 4, 086, mi, long, the, nile, is, reported, to, be, anywhere, from, 5, 499, to, 7, 088, km, 3, 417, to, 4, 404, mi, often, it, is, said, to, be, about, 6, 650, km, 4, 130, mi, long, there, are, several, factors, that, can, affect, these, measurements, such, as, the, position, of, the, geographical, source, and, the, mouth, the, scale, of, measurement, and, the, length, measuring, techniques, for, details, see, also, list, of, rivers, by, length, in, july, 2008, the, brazilian, institute, for, space, research, inpe, published, a, news, article, on, their, webpage, claiming, that, the, amazon, river, was, 140, km, 87, mi, longer, than, the, nile, the, amazon, s, length, was, calculated, as, 6, 992, km, 4, 345, mi, taking, the, apacheta, creek, as, its, source, using, the, same, techniques, the, length, of, the, nile, was, calculated, as, 6, 853, km, 4, 258, mi, which, is, longer, than, previous, estimates, but, still, shorter, than, the, amazon, the, results, were, reached, by, measuring, the, amazon, downstream, to, the, beginning, of, the, tidal, estuary, of, canal, do, sul, and, then, after, a, sharp, turn, back, following, tidal, canals, surrounding, the, isle, of, maraj, and, finally, including, the, marine, waters, of, the, r, o, par, bay, in, its, entire, length, according, to, an, earlier, article, on, the, webpage, of, the, national, geographic, the, amazon, s, length, was, calculated, as, 6, 800, km, 4, 200, mi, by, a, brazilian, scientist, in, june, 2007, guido, gelli, director, of, science, at, the, brazilian, institute, of, geography, and, statistics, ibge, told, london, s, telegraph, newspaper, that, it, could, be, considered, that, the, amazon, was, the, longest, river, in, the, world, however, according, to, the, above, sources, none, of, the, two, results, was, published, and, questions, were, raised, about, the, researchers, methodology, in, 2009, a, peer, reviewed, article, was, published, concluding, that, the, nile, is, longer, than, the, amazon, by, stating, a, length, of, 7, 088, km, 4, 404, mi, for, the, nile, and, 6, 575, km, 4, 086, mi, for, the, amazon, measured, by, using, a, combination, of, satellite, image, analysis, and, field, investigations, to, the, source, regions, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, final, length, of, the, amazon, remains, open, to, interpretation, and, continued, debate, the, amazon, basin, the, largest, in, the, world, covers, about, 40, of, south, america, an, area, of, approximately, 7, 050, 000, km, 2, 2, 720, 000, sq, mi, it, drains, from, west, to, east, from, iquitos, in, peru, across, brazil, to, the, atlantic, it, gathers, its, waters, from, 5, degrees, north, latitude, to, 20, degrees, south, latitude, its, most, remote, sources, are, found, on, the, inter, andean, plateau, just, a, short, distance, from, the, pacific, ocean, the, amazon, river, and, its, tributaries, are, characterised, by, extensive, forested, areas, that, become, flooded, every, rainy, season, every, year, the, river, rises, more, than, 9, m, 30, ft, flooding, the, surrounding, forests, known, as, v, rzea, flooded, forests, the, amazon, s, flooded, forests, are, the, most, extensive, example, of, this, habitat, type, in, the, world, in, an, average, dry, season, 110, 000, km, 2, 42, 000, sq, mi, of, land, are, water, covered, while, in, the, wet, season, the, flooded, area, of, the, amazon, basin, rises, to, 350, 000, km, 2, 140, 000, sq, mi, the, quantity, of, water, released, by, the, amazon, to, the, atlantic, ocean, is, enormous, up, to, 300, 000, m, 3, s, 11, 000, 000, cu, ft, s, in, the, rainy, season, with, an, average, of, 209, 000, m, 3, s, 7, 400, 000, cu, ft, s, from, 1973, to, 1990, the, amazon, is, responsible, for, about, 20, of, the, earth, s, fresh, water, entering, the, ocean, the, river, pushes, a, vast, plume, of, fresh, water, into, the, ocean, the, plume, is, about, 400, km, 250, mi, long, and, between, 100, and, 200, km, 62, and, 124, mi, wide, the, fresh, water, being, lighter, flows, on, top, of, the, seawater, diluting, the, salinity, and, altering, the, colour, of, the, ocean, surface, over, an, area, up, to, 2, 500, 000, km, 2, 970, 000, sq, mi, in, extent, for, centuries, ships, have, reported, fresh, water, near, the, amazon, s, mouth, yet, well, out, of, sight, of, land, in, what, otherwise, seemed, to, be, the, open, ocean, the, atlantic, has, sufficient, wave, and, tidal, energy, to, carry, most, of, the, amazon, s, sediments, out, to, sea, thus, the, amazon, does, not, form, a, true, delta, the, great, deltas, of, the, world, are, all, in, relatively, protected, bodies, of, water, while, the, amazon, empties, directly, into, the, turbulent, atlantic, there, is, a, natural, water, union, between, the, amazon, and, the, orinoco, basins, the, so, called, casiquiare, canal, the, casiquiare, is, a, river, distributary, of, the, upper, orinoco, which, flows, southward, into, the, rio, negro, which, in, turn, flows, into, the, amazon, the, casiquiare, is,
