the, sierra, nevada, s, i, r, n, v, d, v, d, see, err, nih, va, h, d, is, a, mountain, range, in, the, western, united, states, between, the, central, valley, of, california, and, the, great, basin, the, vast, majority, of, the, range, lies, in, the, state, of, california, although, the, carson, range, spur, lies, primarily, in, nevada, the, sierra, nevada, is, part, of, the, american, cordillera, an, almost, continuous, chain, of, mountain, ranges, that, forms, the, western, backbone, of, the, americas, the, sierra, runs, 400, mi, 640, km, north, south, and, its, width, ranges, from, 50, mi, 80, km, to, 80, mi, 130, km, across, east, west, notable, features, include, general, sherman, the, largest, tree, in, the, world, by, volume, lake, tahoe, the, largest, alpine, lake, in, north, america, mount, whitney, at, 14, 505, ft, 4, 421, m, the, highest, point, in, the, contiguous, united, states, and, yosemite, valley, sculpted, by, glaciers, from, one, hundred, million, year, old, granite, containing, high, waterfalls, the, sierra, is, home, to, three, national, parks, twenty, six, wilderness, areas, ten, national, forests, and, two, national, monuments, these, areas, include, yosemite, sequoia, and, kings, canyon, national, parks, as, well, as, devils, postpile, national, monument, more, than, one, hundred, million, years, ago, during, the, nevadan, orogeny, granite, formed, deep, underground, the, range, started, to, uplift, less, than, five, million, years, ago, and, erosion, by, glaciers, exposed, the, granite, and, formed, the, light, colored, mountains, and, cliffs, that, make, up, the, range, the, uplift, caused, a, wide, range, of, elevations, and, climates, in, the, sierra, nevada, which, are, reflected, by, the, presence, of, five, life, zones, areas, with, similar, plant, and, animal, communities, uplift, continues, due, to, faulting, caused, by, tectonic, forces, creating, spectacular, fault, block, escarpments, along, the, eastern, edge, of, the, southern, sierra, the, sierra, nevada, has, played, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, california, and, the, united, states, the, california, gold, rush, occurred, in, the, western, foothills, from, 1848, through, 1855, due, to, its, inaccessibility, the, range, was, not, fully, explored, until, 1912, 81, used, in, 1542, by, juan, rodr, guez, cabrillo, to, describe, a, pacific, coast, range, santa, cruz, mountains, the, term, sierra, nevada, was, a, general, identification, of, less, familiar, ranges, toward, the, interior, in, 1776, pedro, font, s, map, applied, the, name, to, the, range, currently, known, as, the, sierra, nevada, the, literal, translation, is, snowy, mountains, from, sierra, a, range, of, mountains, 1610s, from, spanish, sierra, jagged, mountain, range, lit, saw, from, latin, serra, a, saw, and, from, fem, of, spanish, nevado, snowy, while, many, mountain, ranges, are, unanimously, referred, to, in, the, plural, smokies, rockies, cascades, etc, since, sierra, is, already, pluralized, in, its, native, language, some, locals, who, live, in, the, sierra, are, not, hesitant, to, admonish, those, who, refer, to, the, area, as, the, sierras, however, there, are, historical, and, literary, references, that, use, the, plural, such, as, the, 1871, collection, of, joaquin, miller, poems, songs, of, the, sierras, ansel, adams, in, response, to, a, publication, of, his, photographs, under, the, title, parmelian, prints, of, the, high, sierras, commented, the, name, sierra, is, already, a, plural, to, add, an, s, is, a, linguistic, californian, and, mountaineering, sin, the, sierra, nevada, lies, primarily, in, central, and, eastern, california, with, the, carson, range, a, small, but, historically, important, spur, extending, into, nevada, west, to, east, the, sierra, nevada, s, elevation, increases, gradually, from, 500, feet, 150, m, in, the, central, valley, to, more, than, 14, 000, feet, 4, 300, m, atop, the, highest, peaks, of, its, crest, 50, to, 75, miles, 80, to, 121, km, to, the, east, the, east, slope, forms, the, steep, sierra, escarpment, unlike, its, surroundings, the, range, receives, a, substantial, amount, of, snowfall, and, precipitation, due, to, orographic, lift, the, sierra, nevada, s, irregular, northern, boundary, stretches, from, the, susan, river, and, fredonyer, pass, to, the, north, fork, feather, river, it, represents, where, the, granitic, bedrock, of, the, sierra, nevada, dives, below, the, southern, extent, of, cenozoic, igneous, surface, rock, from, the, cascade, range, it, is, bounded, on, the, west, by, california, s, central, valley, on, the, east, by, the, basin, and, range, province, and, on, the, southeast, by, the, mojave, desert, the, southern, boundary, is, at, tehachapi, pass, physiographically, the, sierra, is, a, section, of, the, cascade, sierra, mountains, province, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, larger, pacific, mountain, system, physiographic, division, the, california, geological, survey, states, that, the, northern, sierra, boundary, is, marked, where, bedrock, disappears, under, the, cenozoic, volcanic, cover, of, the, cascade, range, the, range, is, drained, on, its, western, slope, by, the, central, valley, watershed, which, discharges, into, the, pacific, ocean, at, san, francisco, the, northern, third, of, the, western, sierra, is, part, of, the, sacramento, river, watershed, including, the, feather, yuba, and, american, river, tributaries, and, the, middle, third, is, drained, by, the, san, joaquin, river, including, the, mokelumne, stanislaus, tuolumne, and, merced, river, tributaries, the, southern, third, of, the, range, is, drained, by, the, kings, kaweah, tule, and, kern, rivers, which, flow, into, the, endorheic, basin, of, tulare, lake, which, rarely, overflows, into, the, san, joaquin, during, wet, years, the, eastern, slope, watershed, of, the, sierra, is, much, narrower, its, rivers, flow, out, into, the, endorheic, great, basin, of, eastern, california, and, western, nevada, from, north, to, south, the, susan, river, flows, into, intermittent, honey, lake, the, truckee, river, flows, from, lake, tahoe, into, pyramid, lake, the, carson, river, runs, into, carson, sink, the, walker, river, into, walker, lake, rush, lee, vining, and, mill, creeks, flow, into, mono, lake, and, the, owens, river, into, dry, owens, lake, although, none, of, the, eastern, rivers, reach, the, sea, many, of, the, streams, from, mono, lake, southwards, are, diverted, into, the, los, angeles, aqueduct, which, provides, water, to, southern, california, the, height, of, the, mountains, in, the, sierra, nevada, increases, gradually, from, north, to, south, between, fredonyer, pass, and, lake, tahoe, the, peaks, range, from, 5, 000, feet, 1, 500, m, to, more, than, 9, 000, feet, 2, 700, m, the, crest, near, lake, tahoe, is, roughly, 9, 000, feet, 2, 700, m, high, with, several, peaks, approaching, the, height, of, freel, peak, 10, 881, ft, or, 3, 317, m, farther, south, the, highest, peak, in, yosemite, national, park, is, mount, lyell, 13, 120, ft, or, 3, 999, m, the, sierra, rises, to, almost, 14, 000, feet, 4, 300, m, with, mount, humphreys, near, bishop, california, finally, near, lone, pine, mount, whitney, is, at, 14, 505, feet, 4, 421, m, the, highest, point, in, the, contiguous, united, states, south, of, mount, whitney, the, elevation, of, the, range, quickly, dwindles, the, crest, elevation, is, almost, 10, 000, feet, 3, 000, m, near, lake, isabella, but, south, of, the, lake, the, peaks, reach, only, a, modest, 8, 000, feet, 2, 400, m, there, are, several, notable, geographical, features, in, the, sierra, nevada, communities, in, the, sierra, nevada, include, paradise, south, lake, tahoe, truckee, grass, valley, lee, vining, mammoth, lakes, sonora, nevada, city, placerville, pollock, pines, portola, auburn, colfax, and, kennedy, meadows, much, of, the, sierra, nevada, consists, of, federal, lands, and, is, either, protected, from, development, or, strictly, managed, the, mountain, range, is, home, to, three, national, parks, yosemite, kings, canyon, and, sequoia, and, two, national, monuments, devils, postpile, and, giant, sequoia, ten, national, forests, span, much, of, the, mountain, range, s, remaining, area, within, these, national, parks, monuments, and, forests, lie, 26, wilderness, areas, which, together, protect, 15, 4, of, the, sierra, s, 63, 118, km, 2, 24, 370, sq, mi, from, logging, and, grazing, the, united, states, forest, service, and, the, bureau, of, land, management, currently, control, 52, of, the, land, in, the, sierra, nevada, logging, and, grazing, are, generally, allowed, on, land, controlled, by, these, agencies, under, federal, regulations, that, balance, recreation, and, development, on, the, land, the, california, bighorn, sheep, zoological, area, near, mount, williamson, in, the, southern, sierra, was, established, to, protect, the, endangered, sierra, nevada, bighorn, sheep, starting, in, 1981, hikers, were, unable, to, enter, the, area, from, may, 15, through, december, 15, in, order, to, protect, the, sheep, as, of, 2010, the, restriction, has, been, lifted, and, access, to, the, area, is, open, for, the, whole, year, the, earliest, rocks, in, the, sierra, nevada, are, metamorphic, roof, pendants, of, paleozoic, age, the, oldest, being, metasedimentary, rocks, from, the, cambrian, in, the, mount, morrison, region, these, dark, colored, hornfels, slates, marbles, and, schists, are, found, in, the, western, foothills, notably, around, coarsegold, west, of, the, tehachapi, pass, and, east, of, the, sierra, crest, the, earliest, granite, of, the, sierra, started, to, form, in, the, triassic, period, this, granite, is, mostly, found, east, of, the, crest, and, north, of, 37, 2, n, in, the, triassic, and, into, the, jurassic, an, island, arc, collided, with, the, west, coast, of, north, america, and, raised, a, chain, of, volcanoes, in, an, event, called, the, nevadan, orogeny, nearly, all, subaerial, sierran, arc, volcanoes, have, since, disappeared, their, remains, were, redeposited, during, the, great, valley, sequence, and, the, subsequent, cenozoic, filling, of, the, great, valley, which, is, the, source, of, much, of, the, sedimentary, rock, in, california, in, the, cretaceous, a, subduction, zone, formed, at, the, edge, of, the, continent, this, means, that, an, oceanic, plate, started, to, dive, beneath, the, north, american, plate, magma, formed, through, the, subduction, of, the, ancient, farallon, plate, rose, in, plumes, plutons, deep, underground, their, combined, mass, forming, what, is, called, the, sierra, nevada, batholith, these, plutons, formed, at, various, times, from, 115, ma, to, 87, ma, the, earlier, plutons, formed, in, the, western, half, of, the, sierra, while, the, later, plutons, formed, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, sierra, at, this, time, the, sierra, nevada, formed, the, western, ramp, of, a, high, plateau, to, the, east, the, nevadaplano, during, this, period, rivers, cut, deep, canyons, into, the, range, generating, topographic, relief, similar, to, the, modern, sierra, nevada, this, period, of, incision, was, halted, approximately, 30, million, years, ago, by, vast, outpourings, of, pyroclastic, flows, from, nevada, which, filled, the, northern, sierran, valleys, with, volcanic, deposits, these, pyroclastic, flows, which, continued, for, about, 10, million, years, were, followed, by, andesitic, lahars, which, nearly, completely, buried, the, northern, sierran, landscape, such, that, only, the, tallest, peaks, emerged, above, a, volcanic, plain, this, second, period, of, volcanism, appears, to, have, been, triggered, by, crustal, extension, associated, with, extension, of, the, basin, and, range, province, as, this, andesitic, volcanism, began, waning, about, 5, million, years, ago, the, rivers, were, able, to, begin, eroding, away, the, 100s, of, meters, of, volcanic, deposits, and, resume, the, incision, that, had, been, halted, by, the, first, period, of, volcanism, some, studies, have, argued, that, this, recent, incision, is, a, sign, of, recent, tectonic, uplift, other, geologists, claim, that, the, elevations, of, many, of, the, modern, rivers, flowing, down, the, range, are, only, 100, 300, m, lower, than, their, ancient, counterparts, from, 30, 40, million, years, ago, and, the, overall, elevation, and, bedrock, topography, of, the, northern, sierra, nevada, has, changed, little, since, at, least, 30, 40, million, years, ago, about, 2, 5, ma, the, earth, s, climate, cooled, and, ice, ages, started, glaciers, carved, out, characteristic, u, shaped, canyons, throughout, the, sierra, the, combination, of, river, and, glacier, erosion, exposed, the, uppermost, portions, of, the, plutons, emplaced, millions, of, years, before, leaving, only, a, remnant, of, metamorphic, rock, on, top, of, some, sierra, peaks, extension, of, the, basin, and, range, continues, today, leading, to, downdropping, of, crustal, blocks, just, east, of, the, sierra, nevada, during, large, earthquakes, such, as, the, lone, pine, earthquake, of, 1872, the, climate, of, the, sierra, nevada, is, influenced, by, the, mediterranean, climate, of, california, during, the, fall, winter, and, spring, precipitation, in, the, sierra, ranges, from, 20, to, 80, in, 510, to, 2, 030, mm, where, it, occurs, mostly, as, snow, above, 6, 000, ft, 1, 800, m, precipitation, is, highest, on, the, central, and, northern, portions, of, the, western, slope, between, 5, 000, and, 8, 000, feet, 1, 500, and, 2, 400, m, elevation, due, to, orographic, lift, 69, above, 8, 000, feet, 2, 400, m, precipitation, diminishes, on, the, western, slope, up, to, the, crest, since, most, of, the, precipitation, has, been, wrung, out, at, lower, elevations, most, parts, of, the, range, east, of, the, crest, are, in, a, rain, shadow, and, receive, less, than, 25, inches, of, precipitation, per, year, while, most, summer, days, are, dry, afternoon, thunderstorms, are, common, particularly, during, the, north, american, monsoon, in, mid, and, late, summer, some, of, these, summer, thunderstorms, drop, over, an, inch, of, rain, in, a, short, period, and, the, lightning, can, start, fires, summer, high, temperatures, average, 42, 90, f, 6, 32, c, winters, are, comparatively, mild, and, the, temperature, is, usually, only, just, low, enough, to, sustain, a, heavy, snowpack, for, example, tuolumne, meadows, at, 8, 600, feet, 2, 600, m, elevation, has, winter, daily, highs, about, 40, f, 4, c, with, daily, lows, about, 10, f, 12, c, the, growing, season, lasts, 20, to, 230, days, strongly, dependent, on, elevation, the, highest, elevations, of, the, sierra, have, an, alpine, climate, the, sierra, nevada, snowpack, is, the, major, source, of, water, and, a, significant, source, of, electric, power, generation, in, california, many, reservoirs, were, constructed, in, the, canyons, of, the, sierra, throughout, the, 20th, century, several, major, aqueducts, serving, both, agriculture, and, urban, areas, distribute, sierra, water, throughout, the, state, however, the, sierra, casts, a, rain, shadow, which, greatly, affects, the, climate, and, ecology, of, the, central, great, basin, this, rain, shadow, is, largely, responsible, for, nevada, being, the, driest, state, in, the, united, states, precipitation, varies, substantially, from, year, to, year, it, is, not, uncommon, for, some, years, to, receive, precipitation, totals, far, above, or, below, normal, the, height, of, the, range, and, the, steepness, of, the, sierra, escarpment, particularly, at, the, southern, end, of, the, range, produces, a, wind, phenomenon, known, as, the, sierra, rotor, this, is, a, horizontal, rotation, of, the, atmosphere, just, east, of, the, crest, of, the, sierra, set, in, motion, as, an, effect, of, strong, westerly, winds, because, of, the, large, number, of, airplanes, that, have, crashed, in, the, sierra, nevada, primarily, due, to, the, complex, weather, and, atmospheric, conditions, such, as, downdrafts, and, microbursts, caused, by, geography, there, a, portion, of, the, area, a, triangle, whose, vertices, are, reno, nevada, fresno, california, and, las, vegas, nevada, has, been, dubbed, the, nevada, triangle, in, reference, to, the, bermuda, triangle, some, counts, put, the, number, of, crashes, in, the, triangle, at, 2, 000, including, millionaire, and, record, breaking, flyer, steve, fossett, hypotheses, that, the, crashes, are, related, in, some, way, to, the, united, states, air, force, s, area, 51, or, to, the, activities, of, extra, terrestrial, aliens, have, no, evidence, to, support, them, the, sierra, nevada, is, divided, into, a, number, of, biotic, zones, each, of, which, is, defined, by, its, climate, and, supports, a, number, of, interdependent, species, life, in, the, higher, elevation, zones, adapted, to, colder, weather, and, to, most, of, the, precipitation, falling, as, snow, the, rain, shadow, of, the, sierra, causes, the, eastern, slope, to, be, warmer, and, drier, each, life, zone, is, higher, in, the, east, a, list, of, biotic, zones, and, corresponding, elevations, is, presented, below, archaeological, excavations, placed, martis, people, of, paleo, indians, in, northcentral, sierra, nevada, during, the, period, of, 3, 000, bce, to, 500, ce, the, earliest, identified, sustaining, indigenous, people, in, the, sierra, nevada, were, the, northern, paiute, tribes, on, the, east, side, with, the, mono, tribe, and, sierra, miwok, tribe, on, the, western, side, and, the, kawaiisu, and, t, batulabal, tribes, in, the, southern, sierra, today, some, historic, intertribal, trade, route, trails, over, mountain, passes, are, known, artifact, locations, such, as, duck, pass, with, its, obsidian, arrowheads, the, california, and, sierra, native, american, tribes, were, predominantly, peaceful, with, occasional, territorial, disputes, between, the, paiute, and, sierra, miwok, tribes, in, the, mountains, washo, and, maidu, were, also, in, this, area, prior, to, the, era, of, european, exploration, and, displacement, american, exploration, of, the, mountain, range, started, in, 1827, although, prior, to, the, 1820s, there, were, spanish, missions, pueblos, towns, presidios, forts, and, ranchos, along, the, coast, of, california, no, spanish, explorers, visited, the, sierra, nevada, the, first, americans, to, visit, the, mountains, were, amongst, a, group, led, by, fur, trapper, jedediah, smith, crossing, north, of, the, yosemite, area, in, may, 1827, at, ebbetts, pass, in, 1833, a, subgroup, of, the, bonneville, expedition, led, by, joseph, reddeford, walker, was, sent, westward, to, find, an, overland, route, to, california, eventually, the, party, discovered, a, route, along, the, humboldt, river, across, present, day, nevada, ascending, the, sierra, nevada, starting, near, present, day, bridgeport, and, descending, between, the, tuolumne, and, merced, river, drainage, the, group, may, have, been, the, first, non, indigenous, people, to, see, yosemite, valley, the, walker, party, probably, visited, either, the, tuolumne, or, merced, groves, of, giant, sequoia, becoming, the, first, non, indigenous, people, to, see, the, giant, trees, but, journals, relating, to, the, walker, party, were, destroyed, in, 1839, in, a, print, shop, fire, in, philadelphia, starting, in, 1841, emigrants, from, the, united, states, started, to, move, to, california, via, sonora, and, walker, passes, in, the, winter, of, 1844, lt, john, c, fr, mont, accompanied, by, kit, carson, was, the, first, european, american, to, see, lake, tahoe, the, fr, mont, party, camped, at, 8, 050, ft, 2, 450, m, the, california, gold, rush, began, at, sutter, s, mill, near, coloma, in, the, western, foothills, of, the, sierra, on, january, 24, 1848, james, w, marshall, a, foreman, working, for, sacramento, pioneer, john, sutter, found, shiny, metal, in, the, tailrace, of, a, lumber, mill, marshall, was, building, for, sutter, on, the, american, river, rumors, soon, started, to, spread, and, were, confirmed, in, march, 1848, by, san, francisco, newspaper, publisher, and, merchant, samuel, brannan, brannan, strode, through, the, streets, of, san, francisco, holding, aloft, a, vial, of, gold, shouting, gold, gold, gold, from, the, american, river, on, august, 19, 1848, the, new, york, herald, was, the, first, major, newspaper, on, the, east, coast, to, report, the, discovery, of, gold, on, december, 5, 1848, president, james, polk, confirmed, the, discovery, of, gold, in, an, address, to, congress, 80, soon, waves, of, immigrants, from, around, the, world, later, called, the, forty, niners, invaded, the, gold, country, of, california, or, mother, lode, miners, lived, in, tents, wood, shanties, or, deck, cabins, removed, from, abandoned, ships, wherever, gold, was, discovered, hundreds, of, miners, would, collaborate, to, put, up, a, camp, and, stake, their, claims, because, the, gold, in, the, california, gravel, beds, was, so, richly, concentrated, the, early, forty, niners, simply, panned, for, gold, in, california, s, rivers, and, streams, 198, 200, however, panning, cannot, take, place, on, a, large, scale, and, miners, and, groups, of, miners, graduated, to, more, complex, placer, mining, groups, of, prospectors, would, divert, the, water, from, an, entire, river, into, a, sluice, alongside, the, river, and, then, dig, for, gold, in, the, newly, exposed, river, bottom, 90, by, 1853, most, of, the, easily, accessible, gold, had, been, collected, and, attention, turned, to, extracting, gold, from, more, difficult, locations, hydraulic, mining, was, used, on, ancient, gold, bearing, gravel, beds, on, hillsides, and, bluffs, in, the, gold, fields, 89, in, hydraulic, mining, a, high, pressure, hose, directed, a, powerful, stream, or, jet, of, water, at, gold, bearing, gravel, beds, it, is, estimated, that, by, the, mid, 1880s, 11, million, troy, ounces, 340, metric, tons, of, gold, worth, approximately, us, 16, billion, in, 2020, prices, had, been, recovered, by, hydraulicking, a, consequence, of, these, extraction, methods, was, that, large, amounts, of, gravel, silt, heavy, metals, and, other, pollutants, were, washed, into, streams, and, rivers, 32, 36, as, of, 1999, many, areas, still, bear, the, scars, of, hydraulic, mining, since, the, resulting, exposed, earth, and, downstream, gravel, deposits, do, not, support, plant, life, 116, 121, it, is, estimated, that, by, 1855, at, least, 300, 000, gold, seekers, merchants, and, other, immigrants, had, arrived, in, california, from, around, the, world, 25, the, huge, numbers, of, newcomers, brought, by, the, gold, rush, drove, native, americans, out, of, their, traditional, hunting, fishing, and, food, gathering, areas, to, protect, their, homes, and, livelihood, some, native, americans, responded, by, attacking, the, miners, provoking, counter, attacks, on, native, villages, the, native, americans, out, gunned, were, often, slaughtered, the, gold, rush, populated, the, western, foothills, of, the, sierra, nevada, but, even, by, 1860, most, of, the, sierra, was, unexplored, the, state, legislature, authorized, the, california, geological, survey, to, officially, explore, the, sierra, and, survey, the, rest, of, the, state, josiah, whitney, was, appointed, to, head, the, survey, men, of, the, survey, including, william, h, brewer, charles, f, hoffmann, and, clarence, king, explored, the, backcountry, of, what, would, become, yosemite, national, park, in, 1863, in, 1864, they, explored, the, area, around, kings, canyon, in, 1869, john, muir, started, his, wanderings, in, the, sierra, nevada, range, and, in, 1871, king, was, the, first, to, climb, mount, langley, mistakenly, believing, he, had, summited, mount, whitney, the, highest, peak, in, the, range, in, 1873, mount, whitney, was, climbed, for, the, first, time, by, 3, men, from, lone, pine, california, on, a, fishing, trip, from, 1892, to, 1897, theodore, solomons, made, the, first, attempt, to, map, a, route, along, the, crest, of, the, sierra, other, people, finished, exploring, and, mapping, the, sierra, bolton, coit, brown, explored, the, kings, river, watershed, in, 1895, 1899, joseph, n, leconte, mapped, the, area, around, yosemite, national, park, and, what, would, become, kings, canyon, national, park, james, s, hutchinson, a, noted, mountaineer, climbed, the, palisades, 1904, and, mount, humphreys, 1905, by, 1912, the, usgs, published, a, set, of, maps, of, the, sierra, nevada, and, the, era, of, exploration, was, over, 81, logging, in, the, sierra, nevada, has, significantly, impacted, the, landscape, the, logging, industry, in, the, sierra, nevada, started, in, the, early, 1800s, when, settlers, relied, on, hand, tools, and, ox, teams, 103, 127, before, the, california, gold, rush, the, industry, was, relatively, small, and, most, of, the, lumber, used, in, the, state, was, imported, however, as, the, demand, for, lumber, to, support, the, mining, industry, increased, logging, became, a, major, industry, in, the, region, initially, most, of, the, lumber, produced, in, california, was, used, in, mining, the, comstock, lode, was, a, major, center, for, logging, with, operations, supplying, lumber, for, the, construction, of, mine, structures, such, as, tunnels, shafts, and, buildings, as, well, as, fuel, for, the, mines, dan, dequille, observed, in, 1876, the, comstock, lode, may, truthfully, be, said, to, be, the, tomb, of, the, forests, of, the, sierra, millions, upon, millions, of, feet, of, lumber, are, annually, buried, in, the, mines, nevermore, to, be, resurrected, in, the, late, 1800s, the, logging, industry, moved, westward, due, to, the, depletion, of, white, pine, forests, in, the, upper, midwest, 9, 14, this, shift, was, encouraged, by, the, positive, portrayal, of, the, sierra, nevada, as, a, promising, timber, region, in, 1859, horace, greely, marveled, i, never, saw, anything, so, much, like, good, timber, in, the, course, of, any, seventy, five, miles, travel, as, i, saw, in, crossing, the, sierra, nevada, the, logging, industry, experienced, significant, growth, in, the, late, 1800s, due, to, several, factors, the, timber, and, stone, act, of, 1878, allowed, individuals, to, claim, ownership, of, old, growth, timber, tracts, which, were, later, consolidated, under, joint, stock, companies, such, as, those, founded, by, midwestern, lumber, magnates, 142, 144, these, companies, had, the, financial, resources, to, transport, timber, from, remote, locations, and, build, sawmills, near, the, tracks, of, the, southern, pacific, railroad, which, connected, the, san, joaquin, valley, to, the, rest, of, the, state, in, the, 1870s, this, facilitated, the, nationwide, distribution, of, lumber, in, addition, technological, advancements, such, as, the, shay, locomotive, and, the, v, shaped, log, flume, made, it, easier, to, transport, lumber, across, mountainous, terrain, the, tourism, potential, of, the, sierra, nevada, was, recognized, early, in, the, european, history, of, the, range, yosemite, valley, was, first, protected, by, the, federal, government, in, 1864, the, valley, and, mariposa, grove, were, ceded, to, california, in, 1866, and, turned, into, a, state, park, john, muir, perceived, overgrazing, by, sheep, and, logging, of, giant, sequoia, to, be, a, problem, in, the, sierra, muir, successfully, lobbied, for, the, protection, of, the, rest, of, yosemite, national, park, congress, created, an, act, to, protect, the, park, in, 1890, the, valley, and, mariposa, grove, were, added, to, the, park, in, 1906, in, the, same, year, sequoia, national, park, was, formed, to, protect, the, giant, sequoia, all, logging, of, the, sequoia, ceased, at, that, time, in, 1903, the, city, of, san, francisco, proposed, building, a, hydroelectric, dam, to, flood, hetch, hetchy, valley, the, city, and, the, sierra, club, argued, over, the, dam, for, 10, years, until, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, raker, act, in, 1913, and, allowed, dam, building, to, proceed, o, shaughnessy, dam, was, completed, in, 1923, between, 1912, and, 1918, congress, debated, three, times, to, protect, lake, tahoe, in, a, national, park, none, of, these, efforts, succeeded, and, after, world, war, ii, towns, such, as, south, lake, tahoe, grew, around, the, shores, of, the, lake, by, 1980, the, permanent, population, of, the, lake, tahoe, area, grew, to, 50, 000, while, the, summer, population, grew, to, 90, 000, the, development, around, lake, tahoe, affected, the, clarity, of, the, lake, water, in, order, to, preserve, the, lake, s, clarity, construction, in, the, tahoe, basin, is, currently, regulated, by, the, tahoe, regional, planning, agency, as, the, 20th, century, progressed, more, of, the, sierra, became, available, for, recreation, other, forms, of, economic, activity, decreased, the, john, muir, trail, a, trail, that, followed, the, sierra, crest, from, yosemite, valley, to, mount, whitney, was, funded, in, 1915, and, finished, in, 1938, kings, canyon, national, park, was, formed, in, 1940, to, protect, the, deep, canyon, of, the, kings, river, in, the, 1920s, automobile, clubs, and, nearby, towns, started, to, lobby, for, trans, sierra, highways, over, piute, pass, which, would, have, closed, the, gap, in, sr, 168, and, other, locations, however, by, end, of, the, 1920s, the, forest, service, and, the, sierra, club, decided, that, roadless, wilderness, in, the, sierra, was, valuable, and, fought, the, proposal, the, piute, pass, proposal, faded, out, by, the, early, 1930s, with, the, forest, service, proposing, a, route, over, minaret, summit, in, 1933, the, minaret, summit, route, was, lobbied, against, by, california, s, governor, ronald, reagan, in, 1972, the, expansion, of, the, john, muir, and, ansel, adams, wildernesses, in, the, 1980s, sealed, off, the, minaret, summit, route, a, trans, sierra, route, between, porterville, and, lone, pine, was, proposed, by, local, businessmen, in, 1923, eventually, a, circuitous, route, across, the, sierra, was, built, across, sherman, pass, by, 1976, by, 1964, the, wilderness, act, protected, portions, of, the, sierra, as, primitive, areas, where, humans, are, simply, temporary, visitors, gradually, 20, wilderness, areas, were, established, to, protect, scenic, backcountry, of, the, sierra, these, wilderness, areas, include, the, john, muir, wilderness, protecting, the, eastern, slope, of, the, sierra, and, the, area, between, yosemite, and, kings, canyon, parks, and, wilderness, within, each, of, the, national, parks, the, sierra, nevada, still, faces, a, number, of, issues, that, threaten, its, conservation, logging, occurs, on, both, private, and, public, lands, including, controversial, clearcut, methods, and, thinning, logging, on, private, and, public, lands, grazing, occurs, on, private, lands, as, well, as, on, national, forest, lands, which, include, wilderness, areas, overgrazing, can, alter, hydrologic, processes, and, vegetation, composition, remove, vegetation, that, serves, as, food, and, habitat, for, native, species, and, contribute, to, sedimentation, and, pollution, in, waterways, a, recent, increase, in, large, wildfires, like, the, rim, fire, in, yosemite, national, park, and, the, stanislaus, national, forest, and, the, king, fire, on, the, eldorado, national, forest, has, prompted, concerns, a, 2015, study, indicated, that, the, increase, in, fire, risk, in, california, may, be, attributable, to, human, induced, climate, change, a, study, looking, back, over, 8, 000, years, found, that, warmer, climate, periods, experienced, severe, droughts, and, more, stand, replacing, fires, and, concluded, that, as, climate, is, such, a, powerful, influence, on, wildfires, trying, to, recreate, presettlement, forest, structure, may, be, difficult, in, a, warmer, future
