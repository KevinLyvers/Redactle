the, tripoli, district, in, the, arab, world, tripoli, is, also, known, as, tripoli, of, the, west, arabic, ar, bulus, al, gharb, to, distinguish, it, from, tripoli, lebanon, known, in, arabic, as, ar, bulus, ash, sham, meaning, tripoli, of, the, east, or, levantine, tripoli, it, is, affectionately, called, the, mermaid, of, the, mediterranean, ar, sat, al, ba, r, lit, bride, of, the, sea, describing, its, turquoise, waters, and, whitewashed, buildings, the, name, derives, from, ancient, greek, romanized, tripolis, literally, three, cities, referring, to, oea, sabratha, and, leptis, magna, the, city, of, oea, was, the, only, one, of, the, three, to, survive, antiquity, and, became, known, as, tripoli, within, a, wider, region, known, as, tripolitania, neighboring, sabratha, was, sometimes, referred, to, by, sailors, as, old, tripoli, in, arabic, it, is, called, ar, bulus, pronunciation, libyan, arabic, r, bl, s, pronunciation, berber, rables, from, ancient, greek, tr, polis, from, ancient, greek, romanized, treis, p, leis, lit, three, cities, the, city, was, founded, in, the, 7th, century, bc, by, the, phoenicians, who, gave, it, the, libyco, berber, name, oyat, punic, wy, t, suggesting, that, the, city, may, have, been, built, upon, an, existing, native, berber, city, the, phoenicians, were, probably, attracted, to, the, site, by, its, natural, harbor, flanked, on, the, western, shore, by, the, small, easily, defensible, peninsula, on, which, they, established, their, colony, the, city, then, passed, into, the, hands, of, the, greek, rulers, of, cyrenaica, as, oea, greek, o, a, cyrene, was, a, colony, on, the, north, african, shore, a, bit, east, of, tambroli, and, halfway, to, egypt, the, carthaginians, later, wrested, it, again, from, the, greeks, by, the, later, half, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, it, belonged, to, the, romans, who, included, it, in, their, province, of, africa, and, gave, it, the, name, of, regio, syrtica, around, the, beginning, of, the, 3rd, century, ad, it, became, known, as, the, regio, tripolitana, meaning, region, of, the, three, cities, namely, oea, i, e, modern, tripoli, sabratha, and, leptis, magna, it, was, probably, raised, to, the, rank, of, a, separate, province, by, septimius, severus, who, was, a, native, of, leptis, magna, in, spite, of, centuries, of, roman, habitation, the, only, visible, roman, remains, apart, from, scattered, columns, and, capitals, usually, integrated, in, later, buildings, is, the, arch, of, marcus, aurelius, from, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, fact, that, tripoli, has, been, continuously, inhabited, unlike, e, g, sabratha, and, leptis, magna, has, meant, that, the, inhabitants, have, either, quarried, material, from, older, buildings, destroying, them, in, the, process, or, built, on, top, of, them, burying, them, beneath, the, streets, where, they, remain, largely, unexcavated, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, tripolitania, region, was, in, some, economic, decline, during, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, in, part, due, to, the, political, unrest, spreading, across, the, mediterranean, world, in, the, wake, of, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, as, well, as, pressure, from, the, invading, vandals, it, is, recorded, by, ibn, abd, al, hakam, that, during, the, siege, of, tripoli, by, a, general, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, named, amr, ibn, al, as, seven, of, his, soldiers, from, the, clan, of, madhlij, sub, branch, of, kinana, unintentionally, found, a, section, on, the, western, side, of, tripoli, beach, that, was, not, walled, during, their, hunting, routine, those, seven, soldiers, then, managed, to, infiltrate, through, this, way, without, being, detected, by, the, city, guards, then, managed, to, incite, a, riot, within, the, city, while, shouting, takbir, causing, the, confused, byzantine, garrison, soldiers, to, think, the, muslim, forces, were, already, inside, in, the, city, and, flee, towards, their, ship, leaving, tripoli, thus, allowing, amr, to, subdue, the, city, easily, according, to, al, baladhuri, tripoli, was, unlike, western, north, africa, taken, by, the, muslims, very, early, after, alexandria, in, the, 22nd, year, of, the, hijra, that, is, between, 30, november, 642, and, 18, november, 643, ad, following, the, conquest, tripoli, was, ruled, by, dynasties, based, in, cairo, egypt, first, the, fatimids, banu, khazrun, and, later, the, mamluks, and, kairouan, in, ifriqiya, the, arab, fihrid, muhallabid, and, aghlabid, dynasties, for, some, time, it, was, a, part, of, the, berber, almohad, caliphate, hafsid, kingdom, and, banu, thabit, dynasty, in, 1510, the, city, was, conquered, by, pedro, navarro, count, of, oliveto, for, spain, in, 1530, it, was, assigned, together, with, malta, to, the, knights, of, st, john, who, had, been, expelled, by, the, ottoman, turks, from, their, stronghold, on, the, island, of, rhodes, finding, themselves, in, hostile, territory, the, knights, reinforced, the, city, walls, and, built, defenses, though, built, on, top, of, older, buildings, possibly, including, a, roman, public, bath, much, of, the, earliest, defensive, structures, of, the, tripoli, castle, or, assaraya, al, hamra, i, e, the, red, castle, are, attributed, to, the, knights, of, st, john, having, previously, combated, piracy, from, their, base, on, rhodes, the, knights, were, given, charge, of, the, city, to, prevent, it, from, being, retaken, by, barbary, pirates, the, disruption, the, pirates, caused, to, the, christian, shipping, lanes, in, the, mediterranean, had, been, one, of, the, main, incentives, for, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, city, the, knights, held, the, city, until, the, siege, of, tripoli, in, 1551, and, their, surrender, to, the, ottomans, led, by, the, muslim, turkish, commander, turgut, reis, turgut, reis, served, as, pasha, of, tripoli, during, his, rule, he, adorned, and, built, up, the, city,

had, fallen, during, the, ottoman, siege, of, the, island, to, a, tomb, in, the, sidi, darghut, mosque, which, he, had, established, close, to, his, palace, in, tripoli, the, palace, has, since, disappeared, supposedly, it, was, situated, between, the, so, called, ottoman, prison, and, the, arch, of, marcus, aurelius, but, the, mosque, along, with, his, tomb, still, stands, close, to, the, bab, al, bahr, gate, after, the, capture, by, the, ottoman, turks, tripoli, once, again, became, a, base, of, operation, for, barbary, pirates, one, of, several, western, attempts, to, dislodge, them, again, was, a, royal, navy, attack, under, john, narborough, in, 1675, of, which, a, vivid, eye, witness, account, has, survived, effective, ottoman, rule, during, this, period, 1551, 1711, was,

tax, to, the, sultan, but, were, in, all, other, aspects, rulers, of, an, independent, kingdom, this, order, of, things, continued, under, the, rule, of, his, descendants, accompanied, by, the, brazen, piracy, and, blackmailing, until, 1835, when, the, ottoman, empire, took, advantage, of, an, internal, struggle, and, re, established, its, authority, the, ottoman, province, vilayet, of,
