has, vast, mineral, and, petroleum, reserves, its, economy, is, among, the, fastest, growing, in, the, world, especially, since, the, end, of, the, civil, war, but, economic, growth, is, highly, uneven, with, most, of, the, nation, s, wealth, concentrated, in, a, disproportionately, small, part, of, the, population, the, largest, investment, and, trade, partners, are, china, the, european,

member, of, the, united, nations, african, union, the, community, of, portuguese, language, countries, and, the, southern, african, development, community, as, of, 2023, the, angolan, population, is, estimated, at, 37, 2, million, angola, is, multicultural, and, multiethnic, angolan, culture, reflects, centuries, of, portuguese, influence, namely, the, predominance, of, the, portuguese, language, and, of, the, catholic, church, intermingled, with, a, variety, of, indigenous, customs, and, traditions, the, name, angola, comes, from, the, portuguese, colonial, name, reino, de, angola, kingdom, of, angola, which, appeared, as, early, as, paulo, dias, de, novais, s, 1571, charter, the, toponym, was, derived, by, the, portuguese, from, the, title, ngola, held, by, the, kings, of, ndongo, and, matamba, ndongo, in, the, highlands, between, the, kwanza, and, lucala, rivers, was, nominally, a, possession, of, the, kingdom, of, kongo, but, in, the, 16th, century, it, was, seeking, greater, independence, modern, angola, was, populated, predominantly, by, nomadic, khoi, and, san, peoples, prior, to, the, first, bantu, migrations, the, khoi, and, san, peoples, were, hunter, gatherers, rather, than, practicing, pastoralism, or, cultivation, of, crops, in, the, first, millennium, bc, they, were, displaced, by, bantu, peoples, arriving, from, the, north, most, of, whom, likely, originated, in, what, is, today, northwestern, nigeria, and, southern, niger, bantu, speakers, introduced, the, cultivation, of, bananas, and, taro, as, well, as, maintenance, of, large, cattle, herds, to, angola, s, central, highlands, and, the, luanda, plain, due, to, a, number, of, inhibiting, geographic, factors, throughout, the, territory, of, angola, namely, harshly, traversable, land, hot, humid, climate, and, a, plethora, of, deadly, diseases, intermingling, of, pre, colonial, tribes, in, angola, had, been, rare, after, settlement, of, the, migrants, a, number, of, political, entities, developed, the, best, known, of, these, was, the, kingdom, of, kongo, based, in, angola, it, extended, northward, to, what, are, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, republic, of, the, congo, and, gabon, it, established, trade, routes, with, other, city, states, and, civilisations, up, and, down, the, coast, of, southwestern, and, western, africa, its, traders, even, reached, great, zimbabwe, and, the, mutapa, empire, although, the, kingdom, engaged, in, little, or, no, trans, oceanic, trade, to, its, south, lay, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, from, which, the, area, of, the, later, portuguese, colony, was, sometimes, known, as, dongo, next, to, that, was, the, kingdom, of, matamba, the, lesser, kingdom, of, kakongo, to, the, north, was, later, a, vassal, of, the, kingdom, of, kongo, the, people, in, all, of, these, states, spoke, kikongo, as, a, common, language, portuguese, explorer, diogo, c, o, reached, the, area, in, 1484, the, previous, year, the, portuguese, had, established, relations, with, the, kingdom, of, kongo, which, stretched, at, the, time, from, modern, gabon, in, the, north, to, the, kwanza, river, in, the, south, the, portuguese, established, their, primary, early, trading, post, at, soyo, which, is, now, the, northernmost, city, in, angola, apart, from, the, cabinda, exclave, paulo, dias, de, novais, founded, s, o, paulo, de, loanda, luanda, in, 1575, with, a, hundred, families, of, settlers, and, four, hundred, soldiers, benguela, was, fortified, in, 1587, and, became, a, township, in, 1617, an, authoritarian, state, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, highly, centralised, around, its, monarch, and, controlled, neighbouring, states, as, vassals, it, had, a, strong, economy, based, on, the, industries, of, copper, ivory, salt, hides, and, to, a, lesser, extent, slaves, the, transition, from, a, feudal, system, of, slavery, to, a, capitalist, one, with, portugal, would, prove, crucial, to, the, history, of, the, kingdom, of, kongo, as, relations, between, kongo, and, portugal, grew, in, the, early, 16th, century, trade, between, the, kingdoms, also, increased, most, of, the, trade, was, in, palm, cloth, copper, and, ivory, but, also, increasing, numbers, of, slaves, kongo, exported, few, slaves, and, its, slave, market, had, remained, internal, but, following, the, development, of, a, successful, sugar, growing, colony, after, portuguese, settlement, of, s, o, tom, kongo, became, a, major, source, of, slaves, for, the, island, s, traders, and, plantations, correspondence, by, king, afonso, documents, the, purchase, and, sale, of, slaves, within, the, country, his, accounts, also, detail, which, slaves, captured, in, war, were, given, or, sold, to, portuguese, merchants, afonso, continued, to, expand, the, kingdom, of, kongo, into, the, 1540s, expanding, its, borders, to, the, south, and, east, the, expansion, of, kongo, s, population, coupled, with, afonso, s, earlier, religious, reforms, allowed, the, ruler, to, centralize, power, in, his, capital, and, increase, the, power, of, the, monarchy, he, also, established, a, royal, monopoly, on, some, trade, to, govern, the, growing, slave, trade, afonso, and, several, portuguese, kings, claimed, a, joint, monopoly, on, the, external, slave, trade, the, slave, trade, increasingly, became, kongo, s, primary, and, arguably, sole, economic, sector, a, major, obstacle, for, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, that, slaves, were, the, only, commodity, for, which, the, european, powers, were, willing, to, trade, kongo, lacked, an, effective, international, currency, kongolese, nobles, could, buy, slaves, with, the, national, currency, of, nzimbu, shells, which, could, be, traded, for, slaves, these, could, be, sold, to, gain, international, currency, as, the, slave, trade, was, the, only, commodity, in, which, europeans, were, interested, in, the, region, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, kongo, economy, was, unable, to, diversify, or, later, industrialise, outside, of, sectors, in, which, slavery, was, involved, such, as, the, arms, industry, the, increased, production, and, sale, of, guns, within, the, kingdom, was, due, to, the, salient, issue, of, the, slave, trade, which, had, become, an, increasingly, violent, struggle, there, was, a, constant, need, for, slaves, for, the, kings, and, queens, to, sell, in, exchange, for, foreign, commodities, the, absence, of, which, would, prevent, them, from, having, any, influence, with, european, powers, such, as, portugal, and, eventually, the, dutch, republic, kongolese, kings, needed, this, influence, to, garner, support, from, european, powers, for, quelling, internal, rebellions, the, situation, became, increasingly, complicated, during, the, rule, of, garcia, ii, who, needed, the, assistance, of, the, dutch, military, to, drive, out, the, portuguese, from, luanda, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, portugal, was, kongo, s, primary, slave, trading, partner, by, the, early, 17th, century, the, supply, of, foreign, slaves, captured, by, the, kongolese, externally, was, waning, the, government, began, to, approve, the, enslavement, of, freeborn, kongolese, citizens, for, relatively, minor, infractions, nearly, any, disobeying, of, the, authoritarian, system, and, the, aristocracy, if, several, villagers, were, deemed, guilty, of, a, crime, it, became, relatively, common, for, the, whole, village, to, be, enslaved, the, resulting, chaos, and, internal, conflict, from, garcia, ii, s, reign, would, lead, into, that, of, his, son, and, successor, ant, nio, i, he, was, killed, in, 1665, by, portuguese, at, the, battle, of, mbwila, 1665, together, with, a, substantial, proportion, of, the, aristocracy, the, colonists, were, expanding, their, power, war, broke, out, more, widely, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, after, the, death, of, ant, nio, i, much, of, the, stability, and, access, to, iron, ore, and, charcoal, necessary, for, gunsmiths, to, maintain, the, arms, industry, was, disrupted, from, then, on, in, this, period, almost, every, kongolese, citizen, was, in, danger, of, being, enslaved, many, kongolese, subjects, were, adroit, in, making, guns, and, they, were, enslaved, to, have, their, skills, available, to, colonists, in, the, new, world, where, they, worked, as, blacksmiths, ironworkers, and, charcoal, makers, the, portuguese, established, several, other, settlements, forts, and, trading, posts, along, the, angolan, coast, principally, trading, in, angolan, slaves, for, plantations, local, slave, dealers, provided, a, large, number, of, slaves, for, the, portuguese, empire, usually, in, exchange, for, manufactured, goods, from, europe, this, part, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, continued, until, after, brazil, s, independence, in, the, 1820s, despite, portugal, s, territorial, claims, in, angola, its, control, over, much, of, the, country, s, vast, interior, was, minimal, in, the, 16th, century, portugal, gained, control, of, the, coast, through, a, series, of, treaties, and, wars, life, for, european, colonists, was, difficult, and, progress, was, slow, john, iliffe, notes, that, portuguese, records, of, angola, from, the, 16th, century, show, that, a, great, famine, occurred, on, average, every, seventy, years, accompanied, by, epidemic, disease, it, might, kill, one, third, or, one, half, of, the, population, destroying, the, demographic, growth, of, a, generation, and, forcing, colonists, back, into, the, river, valleys, during, the, portuguese, restoration, war, the, dutch, west, india, company, occupied, the, principal, settlement, of, luanda, in, 1641, using, alliances, with, local, peoples, to, carry, out, attacks, against, portuguese, holdings, elsewhere, a, fleet, under, salvador, de, s, retook, luanda, in, 1648, reconquest, of, the, rest, of, the, territory, was, completed, by, 1650, new, treaties, with, the, kongo, were, signed, in, 1649, others, with, njinga, s, kingdom, of, matamba, and, ndongo, followed, in, 1656, the, conquest, of, pungo, andongo, in, 1671, was, the, last, major, portuguese, expansion, from, luanda, as, attempts, to, invade, kongo, in, 1670, and, matamba, in, 1681, failed, colonial, outposts, also, expanded, inward, from, benguela, but, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, inroads, from, luanda, and, benguela, were, very, limited, hamstrung, by, a, series, of, political, upheavals, in, the, early, 1800s, portugal, was, slow, to, mount, a, large, scale, annexation, of, angolan, territory, the, slave, trade, was, abolished, in, angola, in, 1836, and, in, 1854, the, colonial, government, freed, all, its, existing, slaves, four, years, later, a, more, progressive, administration, appointed, by, portugal, abolished, slavery, altogether, however, these, decrees, remained, largely, unenforceable, and, the, portuguese, depended, on, assistance, from, the, british, royal, navy, and, what, became, known, as, the, blockade, of, africa, to, enforce, their, ban, on, the, slave, trade, this, coincided, with, a, series, of, renewed, military, expeditions, into, the, bush, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, portugal, had, established, its, dominion, as, far, north, as, the, congo, river, and, as, far, south, as, moss, medes, until, the, late, 1880s, portugal, entertained, proposals, to, link, angola, with, its, colony, in, mozambique, but, was, blocked, by, british, and, belgian, opposition, in, this, period, the, portuguese, came, up, against, different, forms, of, armed, resistance, from, various, peoples, in, angola, the, berlin, conference, in, 1884, 1885, set, the, colony, s, borders, delineating, the, boundaries, of, portuguese, claims, in, angola, although, many, details, were, unresolved, until, the, 1920s, trade, between, portugal, and, its, african, territories, rapidly, increased, as, a, result, of, protective, tariffs, leading, to, increased, development, and, a, wave, of, new, portuguese, immigrants, between, 1939, and, 1943, portuguese, army, operations, against, the, mucubal, who, they, accused, of, rebellion, and, cattle, thieving, resulted, in, hundreds, of, mucubal, killed, during, the, campaign, 3, 529, were, taken, prisoner, 20, of, whom, were, women, and, children, and, imprisoned, in, concentration, camps, many, died, in, captivity, from, undernourishment, violence, and, forced, labor, around, 600, were, sent, to, sao, tome, and, principe, hundreds, were, also, sent, to, a, camp, in, damba, where, 26, died, under, colonial, law, black, angolans, were, forbidden, from, forming, political, parties, or, labour, unions, the, first, nationalist, movements, did, not, take, root, until, after, world, war, ii, spearheaded, by, a, largely, westernised, and, portuguese, speaking, urban, class, which, included, many, mesti, os, during, the, early, 1960s, they, were, joined, by, other, associations, stemming, from, ad, hoc, labour, activism, in, the, rural, workforce, portugal, s, refusal, to, address, increasing, angolan, demands, for, self, determination, provoked, an, armed, conflict, which, erupted, in, 1961, with, the, baixa, de, cassanje, revolt, and, gradually, evolved, into, a, protracted, war, of, independence, that, persisted, for, the, next, twelve, years, throughout, the, conflict, three, militant, nationalist, movements, with, their, own, partisan, guerrilla, wings, emerged, from, the, fighting, between, the, portuguese, government, and, local, forces, supported, to, varying, degrees, by, the, portuguese, communist, party, the, national, front, for, the, liberation, of, angola, fnla, recruited, from, bakongo, refugees, in, zaire, benefiting, from, particularly, favourable, political, circumstances, in, l, opoldville, and, especially, from, a, common, border, with, zaire, angolan, political, exiles, were, able, to, build, up, a, power, base, among, a, large, expatriate, community, from, related, families, clans, and, traditions, people, on, both, sides, of, the, border, spoke, mutually, intelligible, dialects, and, enjoyed, shared, ties, to, the, historical, kingdom, of, kongo, though, as, foreigners, skilled, angolans, could, not, take, advantage, of, mobutu, sese, seko, s, state, employment, programme, some, found, work, as, middlemen, for, the, absentee, owners, of, various, lucrative, private, ventures, the, migrants, eventually, formed, the, fnla, with, the, intention, of, making, a, bid, for, political, power, upon, their, envisaged, return, to, angola, a, largely, ovimbundu, guerrilla, initiative, against, the, portuguese, in, central, angola, from, 1966, was, spearheaded, by, jonas, savimbi, and, the, national, union, for, the, total, independence, of, angola, unita, it, remained, handicapped, by, its, geographic, remoteness, from, friendly, borders, the, ethnic, fragmentation, of, the, ovimbundu, and, the, isolation, of, peasants, on, european, plantations, where, they, had, little, opportunity, to, mobilise, during, the, late, 1950s, the, rise, of, the, marxist, leninist, popular, movement, for, the, liberation, of, angola, mpla, in, the, east, and, dembos, hills, north, of, luanda, came, to, hold, special, significance, formed, as, a, coalition, resistance, movement, by, the, angolan, communist, party, the, organisation, s, leadership, remained, predominantly, ambundu, and, courted, public, sector, workers, in, luanda, although, both, the, mpla, and, its, rivals, accepted, material, assistance, from, the, soviet, union, or, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, former, harboured, strong, anti, imperialist, views, and, was, openly, critical, of, the, united, states, and, its, support, for, portugal, this, allowed, it, to, win, important, ground, on, the, diplomatic, front, soliciting, support, from, nonaligned, governments, in, morocco, ghana, guinea, mali, and, the, united, arab, republic, the, mpla, attempted, to, move, its, headquarters, from, conakry, to, l, opoldville, in, october, 1961, renewing, efforts, to, create, a, common, front, with, the, fnla, then, known, as, the, union, of, angolan, peoples, upa, and, its, leader, holden, roberto, roberto, turned, down, the, offer, when, the, mpla, first, attempted, to, insert, its, own, insurgents, into, angola, the, cadres, were, ambushed, and, annihilated, by, upa, partisans, on, roberto, s, orders, setting, a, precedent, for, the, bitter, factional, strife, which, would, later, ignite, the, angolan, civil, war, throughout, the, war, of, independence, the, three, rival, nationalist, movements, were, severely, hampered, by, political, and, military, factionalism, as, well, as, their, inability, to, unite, guerrilla, efforts, against, the, portuguese, between, 1961, and, 1975, the, mpla, unita, and, the, fnla, competed, for, influence, in, the, angolan, population, and, the, international, community, the, soviet, union, and, cuba, became, especially, sympathetic, towards, the, mpla, and, supplied, that, party, with, arms, ammunition, funding, and, training, they, also, backed, unita, militants, until, it, became, clear, that, the, latter, was, at, irreconcilable, odds, with, the, mpla, the, collapse, of, portugal, s, estado, novo, government, following, the, 1974, carnation, revolution, suspended, all, portuguese, military, activity, in, africa, and, the, brokering, of, a, ceasefire, pending, negotiations, for, angolan, independence, encouraged, by, the, organisation, of, african, unity, holden, roberto, jonas, savimbi, and, mpla, chairman, agostinho, neto, met, in, mombasa, in, early, january, 1975, and, agreed, to, form, a, coalition, government, this, was, ratified, by, the, alvor, agreement, later, that, month, which, called, for, general, elections, and, set, the, country, s, independence, date, for, 11, november, 1975, all, three, factions, however, followed, up, on, the, ceasefire, by, taking, advantage, of, the, gradual, portuguese, withdrawal, to, seize, various, strategic, positions, acquire, more, arms, and, enlarge, their, militant, forces, the, rapid, influx, of, weapons, from, numerous, external, sources, especially, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, as, well, as, the, escalation, of, tensions, between, the, nationalist, parties, fueled, a, new, outbreak, of, hostilities, with, tacit, american, and, zairean, support, the, fnla, began, massing, large, numbers, of, troops, in, northern, angola, in, an, attempt, to, gain, military, superiority, meanwhile, the, mpla, began, securing, control, of, luanda, a, traditional, ambundu, stronghold, sporadic, violence, broke, out, in, luanda, over, the, next, few, months, after, the, fnla, attacked, the, mpla, s, political, headquarters, in, march, 1975, the, fighting, intensified, with, street, clashes, in, april, and, may, and, unita, became, involved, after, over, two, hundred, of, its, members, were, massacred, by, an, mpla, contingent, that, june, an, upswing, in, soviet, arms, shipments, to, the, mpla, influenced, a, decision, by, the, central, intelligence, agency, to, likewise, provide, substantial, covert, aid, to, the, fnla, and, unita, in, august, 1975, the, mpla, requested, direct, assistance, from, the, soviet, union, in, the, form, of, ground, troops, the, soviets, declined, offering, to, send, advisers, but, no, troops, however, cuba, was, more, forthcoming, and, in, late, september, dispatched, nearly, five, hundred, combat, personnel, to, angola, along, with, sophisticated, weaponry, and, supplies, by, independence, there, were, over, a, thousand, cuban, soldiers, in, the, country, they, were, kept, supplied, by, a, massive, airbridge, carried, out, with, soviet, aircraft, the, persistent, buildup, of, cuban, and, soviet, military, aid, allowed, the, mpla, to, drive, its, opponents, from, luanda, and, blunt, an, abortive, intervention, by, zairean, and, south, african, troops, which, had, deployed, in, a, belated, attempt, to, assist, the, fnla, and, unita, the, fnla, was, largely, annihilated, after, the, decisive, battle, of, quifangondo, although, unita, managed, to, withdraw, its, civil, officials, and, militia, from, luanda, and, seek, sanctuary, in, the, southern, provinces, from, there, savimbi, continued, to, mount, a, determined, insurgent, campaign, against, the, mpla, between, 1975, and, 1991, the, mpla, implemented, an, economic, and, political, system, based, on, the, principles, of, scientific, socialism, incorporating, central, planning, and, a, marxist, leninist, one, party, state, it, embarked, on, an, ambitious, programme, of, nationalisation, and, the, domestic, private, sector, was, essentially, abolished, privately, owned, enterprises, were, nationalised, and, incorporated, into, a, single, umbrella, of, state, owned, enterprises, known, as, unidades, economicas, estatais, uee, under, the, mpla, angola, experienced, a, significant, degree, of, modern, industrialisation, however, corruption, and, graft, also, increased, and, public, resources, were, either, allocated, inefficiently, or, simply, embezzled, by, officials, for, personal, enrichment, the, ruling, party, survived, an, attempted, coup, d, tat, by, the, maoist, oriented, communist, organisation, of, angola, oca, in, 1977, which, was, suppressed, after, a, series, of, bloody, political, purges, left, thousands, of, oca, supporters, dead, the, mpla, abandoned, its, former, marxist, ideology, at, its, third, party, congress, in, 1990, and, declared, social, democracy, to, be, its, new, platform, angola, subsequently, became, a, member, of, the, international, monetary, fund, restrictions, on, the, market, economy, were, also, reduced, in, an, attempt, to, draw, foreign, investment, by, may, 1991, it, reached, a, peace, agreement, with, unita, the, bicesse, accords, which, scheduled, new, general, elections, for, september, 1992, when, the, mpla, secured, a, major, electoral, victory, unita, objected, to, the, results, of, both, the,
