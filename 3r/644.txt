east, africa, also, known, as, eastern, africa, or, the, east, of, africa, is, a, region, at, the, eastern, edge, of, the, african, continent, distinguished, by, its, geographical, historical, and, cultural, landscape, defined, in, varying, scopes, the, region, is, recognized, in, the, united, nations, statistics, division, scheme, as, encompassing, 18, sovereign, states, and, 4, territories, east, africa, is, acknowledged, as, the, cradle, of, early, modern, humans, who, first, emerged, around, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, years, ago, before, spreading, globally, though, madagascar, was, only, settled, 3000, years, ago, in, a, narrow, sense, particularly, in, english, speaking, contexts, east, africa, refers, to, the, area, comprising, kenya, tanzania, and, uganda, largely, due, to, their, shared, history, under, the, omani, empire, and, as, parts, of, the, british, east, africa, protectorate, and, german, east, africa, further, extending, east, africa, s, definition, the, horn, of, africa, comprising, djibouti, eritrea, ethiopia, and, somalia, stands, out, as, a, distinct, geopolitical, entity, within, east, africa, the, east, african, community, an, economic, and, political, bloc, currently, includes, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, somalia, burundi, kenya, rwanda, south, sudan, uganda, and, tanzania, notably, the, african, great, lakes, region, overlaps, significantly, with, these, countries, inside, of, somalia, there, are, two, unrecognised, states, somaliland, and, puntland, although, puntland, still, wants, to, join, back, with, somalia, for, now, it, is, independent, adjacent, to, these, mainland, territories, are, island, nations, and, territories, such, as, socotra, comoros, mauritius, seychelles, r, union, mayotte, and, the, scattered, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, regions, including, portions, of, mozambique, and, madagascar, often, aligned, with, southern, africa, share, significant, historical, and, cultural, connections, with, east, africa, particularly, through, the, indian, ocean, s, maritime, networks, sudan, is, also, sometimes, included, due, in, part, because, it, is, a, member, of, the, common, market, for, eastern, and, southern, africa, comesa, free, trade, area, according, to, the, theory, of, the, recent, african, origin, of, modern, humans, the, predominantly, held, belief, among, most, archaeologists, east, africa, in, the, area, of, the, african, great, lakes, is, where, anatomically, modern, humans, first, appeared, there, are, differing, theories, on, whether, there, was, a, single, exodus, or, several, a, multiple, dispersal, model, involves, the, southern, dispersal, theory, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, north, africa, was, the, region, of, africa, from, which, modern, humans, who, first, trekked, out, of, the, continent, according, to, both, genetic, and, fossil, evidence, it, has, been, posited, that, archaic, homo, sapiens, evolved, into, anatomically, modern, humans, in, the, horn, of, africa, around, 200, 000, years, ago, and, dispersed, from, there, the, recognition, of, homo, sapiens, idaltu, and, omo, kibish, as, anatomically, modern, humans, would, justify, the, description, of, contemporary, humans, with, the, subspecies, name, homo, sapiens, sapiens, because, of, their, early, dating, and, unique, physical, characteristics, idaltu, and, kibish, represent, the, immediate, ancestors, of, anatomically, modern, humans, as, suggested, by, the, out, of, africa, theory, in, 2017, finds, of, modern, human, remains, dating, to, ca, 300, 000, years, ago, in, jebel, irhoud, in, morocco, suggested, that, modern, humans, arose, earlier, and, possibly, in, a, larger, area, of, africa, than, previously, thought, east, africa, is, one, of, the, earliest, regions, where, homo, sapiens, are, believed, to, have, lived, evidence, was, found, in, 2018, dating, to, about, 320, 000, years, ago, at, the, kenyan, site, of, olorgesailie, of, the, early, emergence, of, modern, behaviors, associated, with, homo, sapiens, including, long, distance, trade, networks, involving, goods, such, as, obsidian, the, use, of, pigments, and, the, possible, making, of, projectile, points, it, is, observed, by, the, authors, of, three, 2018, studies, on, the, site, that, the, evidence, of, these, behaviors, is, approximately, contemporary, to, the, earliest, known, homo, sapiens, fossil, remains, from, africa, such, as, at, jebel, irhoud, and, florisbad, and, they, suggest, that, complex, and, modern, behaviors, had, already, begun, in, africa, around, the, time, of, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, in, september, 2019, scientists, reported, the, computerized, determination, based, on, 260, ct, scans, of, a, virtual, skull, shape, of, the, last, common, human, ancestor, to, modern, humans, h, sapiens, representative, of, the, earliest, homo, sapiens, and, suggested, that, homo, sapiens, arose, between, 350, 000, and, 260, 000, years, ago, through, a, merging, of, populations, in, south, and, east, africa, the, migration, route, of, the, out, of, africa, theory, probably, occurred, in, east, africa, through, bab, el, mandeb, today, at, the, bab, el, mandeb, straits, the, red, sea, is, about, 12, miles, 19, kilometres, wide, but, 50, 000, years, ago, it, was, much, narrower, and, sea, levels, were, 70, meters, lower, though, the, straits, were, never, completely, closed, there, may, have, been, islands, in, between, which, could, be, reached, using, simple, rafts, some, of, the, earliest, hominin, skeletal, remains, have, been, found, in, the, wider, region, including, fossils, discovered, in, the, awash, valley, of, ethiopia, as, well, as, in, the, koobi, fora, in, kenya, and, olduvai, gorge, in, tanzania, the, southern, part, of, east, africa, was, occupied, until, recent, times, by, khoisan, hunter, gatherers, whereas, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, donkey, and, such, crop, plants, as, teff, allowed, the, beginning, of, agriculture, around, 7, 000, bce, lowland, barriers, and, diseases, carried, by, the, tsetse, fly, however, prevented, the, donkey, and, agriculture, from, spreading, southwards, only, in, quite, recent, times, has, agriculture, spread, to, the, more, humid, regions, south, of, the, equator, through, the, spread, of, cattle, sheep, and, crops, such, as, millet, language, distributions, suggest, that, this, most, likely, occurred, from, sudan, into, the, african, great, lakes, region, since, the, nilotic, languages, spoken, by, these, pre, bantu, farmers, have, their, closest, relatives, in, the, middle, nile, basin, djibouti, eritrea, ethiopia, somalia, and, the, red, sea, coast, of, sudan, are, considered, the, most, likely, location, of, the, land, known, to, the, ancient, egyptians, as, punt, the, old, kingdom, s, first, mention, dates, to, the, 25th, century, bce, the, ancient, puntites, were, a, nation, of, people, that, had, close, relations, with, pharaonic, egypt, during, the, times, of, pharaoh, sahure, and, queen, hatshepsut, the, kingdom, of, aksum, was, a, trading, empire, centered, eritrea, and, northern, ethiopia, it, existed, from, approximately, 100, 940, ce, growing, from, the, proto, aksumite, iron, age, period, c, 4th, century, bce, to, achieve, prominence, by, the, 1st, century, ce, the, kingdom, is, mentioned, in, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, as, an, important, market, place, for, ivory, which, was, exported, throughout, the, ancient, world, aksum, was, at, the, time, ruled, by, zoskales, who, also, governed, the, port, of, adulis, the, aksumite, rulers, facilitated, trade, by, minting, their, own, aksumite, currency, the, state, also, established, its, hegemony, over, the, declining, kingdom, of, kush, and, regularly, entered, the, politics, of, the, kingdoms, on, the, arabian, peninsula, eventually, extending, its, rule, over, the, region, with, the, conquest, of, the, himyarite, kingdom, between, 2500, and, 3000, years, ago, bantu, speaking, peoples, began, a, millennia, long, series, of, migrations, eastward, from, their, homeland, around, southern, cameroon, this, bantu, expansion, introduced, agriculture, into, much, of, the, african, great, lakes, region, during, the, following, fifteen, centuries, the, bantu, slowly, intensified, farming, and, grazing, over, all, suitable, regions, of, east, africa, in, the, process, making, contact, with, austronesian, and, arabic, speaking, settlers, on, southern, coastal, areas, the, latter, also, spread, islam, to, the, coastal, belt, but, most, bantu, remained, african, traditional, religion, adherents, over, a, period, of, many, centuries, most, hunting, foraging, peoples, were, displaced, and, absorbed, by, incoming, bantu, communities, as, well, as, by, later, nilotic, communities, the, bantu, expansion, was, a, long, series, of, physical, migrations, a, diffusion, of, language, and, knowledge, out, into, and, in, from, neighboring, populations, and, a, creation, of, new, societal, groups, involving, inter, marriage, among, communities, and, small, groups, moving, to, communities, and, small, groups, moving, to, new, areas, after, their, movements, from, their, original, homeland, in, west, africa, bantus, also, encountered, in, central, east, africa, peoples, of, cushitic, origin, as, cattle, terminology, in, use, amongst, the, few, modern, bantu, pastoralist, groups, suggests, the, bantu, migrants, would, acquire, cattle, from, their, new, cushitic, neighbors, linguistic, evidence, also, indicates, that, bantus, most, likely, borrowed, the, custom, of, milking, cattle, directly, from, cushitic, peoples, in, the, area, on, the, coastal, section, of, the, african, great, lakes, region, another, mixed, bantu, community, developed, through, contact, with, muslim, arab, and, persian, traders, leading, to, the, development, of, the, mixed, arab, persian, and, african, swahili, city, states, the, swahili, culture, that, emerged, from, these, exchanges, evinces, many, arab, and, islamic, influences, not, seen, in, traditional, bantu, culture, as, do, the, many, afro, arab, members, of, the, bantu, swahili, people, with, its, original, speech, community, centered, on, the, coastal, parts, of, tanzania, particularly, zanzibar, and, kenya, a, seaboard, referred, to, as, the, swahili, coast, the, bantu, swahili, language, contains, many, arabic, loan, words, as, a, consequence, of, these, interactions, its, important, to, note, that, kiswahili, grammar, and, structure, are, purely, african, and, bantu, even, if, its, vocabulary, has, non, african, influence, in, the, same, way, english, remains, a, germanic, language, regardless, of, its, vocabulary, being, heavily, influenced, by, latin, and, french, among, other, languages, the, earliest, bantu, inhabitants, of, the, east, coast, of, kenya, and, tanzania, encountered, by, these, later, arab, and, persian, settlers, have, been, variously, identified, with, the, trading, settlements, of, rhapta, azania, and, menouthias, referenced, in, early, greek, and, chinese, writings, from, 50, ce, to, 500, ce, ultimately, giving, rise, to, the, name, for, tanzania, these, early, writings, perhaps, document, the, first, wave, of, bantu, settlers, to, reach, central, east, africa, during, their, migration, between, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, large, african, great, lakes, kingdoms, and, states, emerged, such, as, the, buganda, and, karagwe, kingdoms, of, uganda, and, tanzania, the, portuguese, were, the, first, europeans, to, explore, the, region, of, current, day, kenya, tanzania, and, mozambique, by, sea, vasco, da, gama, visited, mombasa, in, 1498, da, gama, s, voyage, was, successful, in, reaching, india, which, permitted, the, portuguese, to, trade, with, the, far, east, directly, by, sea, this, in, turn, challenged, the, older, trading, networks, of, mixed, land, and, sea, routes, such, as, the, spice, trade, routes, which, utilized, the, persian, gulf, red, sea, and, camel, caravans, to, reach, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, republic, of, venice, had, gained, control, over, much, of, the, trade, routes, between, europe, and, asia, after, traditional, land, routes, to, india, had, been, closed, by, the, ottoman, turks, portugal, hoped, to, use, the, sea, route, pioneered, by, da, gama, to, break, the, once, venetian, trading, monopoly, portuguese, rule, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, focused, mainly, on, a, coastal, strip, centered, around, mombasa, the, portuguese, presence, in, the, area, officially, began, after, 1505, when, flagships, under, the, command, of, don, francisco, de, almeida, conquered, kilwa, an, island, located, in, what, is, now, southern, tanzania, in, march, 1505, having, received, from, manuel, i, of, portugal, the, appointment, of, viceroy, of, the, newly, conquered, territory, in, india, he, set, sail, from, lisbon, in, command, of, a, large, and, powerful, fleet, and, arrived, in, july, at, quiloa, kilwa, which, yielded, to, him, almost, without, a, struggle, a, much, more, vigorous, resistance, was, offered, by, the, moors, of, mombasa, however, the, town, was, taken, and, destroyed, and, its, large, treasures, went, to, strengthen, the, resources, of, almeida, attacks, followed, on, hoja, now, known, as, ungwana, located, at, the, mouth, of, the, tana, river, barawa, angoche, pate, and, other, coastal, towns, until, the, western, indian, ocean, was, a, safe, haven, for, portuguese, commercial, interests, at, other, places, on, his, way, such, as, the, island, of, angediva, near, goa, and, cannanore, the, portuguese, built, forts, and, adopted, measures, to, secure, the, portuguese, supremacy, portugal, s, main, goal, on, the, swahili, coast, was, to, take, control, of, the, spice, trade, from, the, arabs, at, this, stage, the, portuguese, presence, in, east, africa, served, the, purposes, of, controlling, trade, within, the, indian, ocean, and, securing, the, sea, routes, linking, europe, to, asia, portuguese, naval, vessels, were, very, disruptive, to, the, commerce, of, portugal, s, enemies, within, the, western, indian, ocean, and, were, able, to, demand, high, tariffs, on, items, transported, through, the, sea, due, to, their, strategic, control, of, ports, and, shipping, lanes, the, construction, of, fort, jesus, in, mombasa, in, 1593, was, meant, to, solidify, portuguese, hegemony, in, the, region, but, their, influence, was, clipped, by, the, british, dutch, and, omani, arab, incursions, into, the, great, lakes, region, during, the, 17th, century, the, omani, arabs, posed, the, most, direct, challenge, to, portuguese, influence, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, by, this, time, the, portuguese, empire, had, already, lost, its, interest, on, the, spice, trade, sea, route, due, to, the, decreasing, profitability, of, that, business, the, arabs, reclaimed, much, of, the, indian, ocean, trade, forcing, the, portuguese, to, retreat, south, where, they, remained, in, portuguese, east, africa, mozambique, as, sole, rulers, until, the, 1975, independence, of, mozambique, omani, arab, colonization, of, the, kenyan, and, tanzanian, coasts, brought, the, once, independent, city, states, under, closer, foreign, scrutiny, and, domination, than, was, experienced, during, the, portuguese, period, like, their, predecessors, the, omani, arabs, were, primarily, able, only, to, control, the, coastal, areas, not, the, interior, however, the, creation, of, clove, plantations, intensification, of, the, slave, trade, and, relocation, of, the, omani, capital, to, zanzibar, in, 1839, by, seyyid, said, had, the, effect, of, consolidating, the, omani, power, in, the, region, arab, governance, of, all, the, major, ports, along, the, swahili, coast, continued, until, british, interests, aimed, particularly, at, ending, the, slave, trade, and, creation, of, a, wage, labour, system, began, to, put, pressure, on, omani, rule, by, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, slave, trade, on, the, open, seas, had, been, completely, outlawed, by, the, british, and, the, omani, arabs, had, little, ability, to, resist, the, british, navy, s, ability, to, enforce, the, directive, the, omani, presence, continued, in, zanzibar, and, pemba, until, the, zanzibar, revolution, in, 1964, however, the, official, omani, arab, presence, in, kenya, was, checked, by, german, and, british, seizure, of, key, ports, and, creation, of, crucial, trade, alliances, with, influential, local, leaders, in, the, 1880s, between, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, east, africa, became, a, theatre, of, competition, between, the, major, imperialistic, european, nations, of, the, time, the, three, main, colors, of, the, african, country, were, beige, red, and, blue, the, red, stood, for, the, english, blue, stood, for, the, french, and, the, beige, stood, for, germany, during, the, period, of, colonialism, during, the, period, of, the, scramble, for, africa, almost, every, country, in, the, larger, region, to, varying, degrees, became, part, of, a, european, colonial, empire, portugal, had, first, established, a, strong, presence, in, southern, mozambique, and, the, indian, ocean, since, the, 15th, century, while, during, this, period, their, possessions, increasingly, grew, including, parts, from, the, present, northern, mozambique, country, up, to, mombasa, in, present, day, kenya, at, lake, malawi, they, finally, met, the, recently, created, british, protectorate, of, nyasaland, nowadays, malawi, which, surrounded, the, homonymous, lake, on, three, sides, leaving, the, portuguese, the, control, of, lake, s, eastern, coast, the, british, empire, set, foot, in, the, region, s, most, exploitable, and, promising, lands, acquiring, what, is, today, uganda, and, kenya, the, protectorate, of, uganda, and, the, colony, of, kenya, were, located, in, a, rich, farmland, area, mostly, appropriate, for, the, cultivation, of, cash, crops, like, coffee, and, tea, as, well, as, for, animal, husbandry, with, products, produced, from, cattle, and, goats, such, as, goat, meat, beef, and, milk, moreover, this, area, had, the, potential, for, a, significant, residential, expansion, being, suitable, for, the, relocation, of, a, large, number, of, british, nationals, to, the, region, prevailing, climatic, conditions, and, the, regions, geomorphology, allowed, the, establishment, of, flourishing, european, style, settlements, like, nairobi, vila, pery, vila, junqueiro, porto, am, lia, louren, o, marques, and, entebbe, the, french, settled, the, largest, island, of, the, indian, ocean, and, the, fourth, largest, globally, madagascar, along, with, a, group, of, smaller, islands, nearby, namely, r, union, and, the, comoros, madagascar, became, part, of, the, french, colonial, empire, following, two, military, campaigns, against, the, kingdom, of, madagascar, which, it, initiated, after, persuading, britain, to, relinquish, its, interests, in, the, island, in, exchange, for, control, of, zanzibar, off, the, coast, of, tanganyika, an, important, island, hub, of, the, spices, trade, the, british, also, held, a, number, of, island, colonies, in, the, region, including, the, extended, archipelago, of, seychelles, and, the, rich, farming, island, of, mauritius, previously, under, the, french, sovereignty, the, german, empire, gained, control, of, a, large, area, named, german, east, africa, comprising, present, day, rwanda, burundi, and, the, mainland, part, of, tanzania, named, tanganyika, in, 1922, the, british, gained, a, league, of, nations, mandate, over, tanganyika, which, it, administered, until, independence, was, granted, to, tanganyika, in, 1961, following, the, zanzibar, revolution, of, 1965, the, independent, state, of, tanganyika, formed, the, united, republic, of, tanzania, by, creating, a, union, between, the, mainland, and, the, island, chain, of, zanzibar, zanzibar, is, now, a, semi, autonomous, state, in, a, union, with, the, mainland, which, is, collectively, and, commonly, referred, to, as, tanzania, german, east, africa, though, very, extensive, was, not, of, such, strategic, importance, as, the, british, crown, s, colonies, to, the, north, the, inhabitation, of, these, lands, was, difficult, and, thus, limited, mainly, due, to, climatic, conditions, and, the, local, geomorphology, italy, gained, control, of, various, parts, of, somalia, in, the, 1880s, the, southern, three, fourths, of, somalia, became, an, italian, protectorate, italian, somaliland, meanwhile, in, 1884, a, narrow, coastal, strip, of, somaliland, came, under, british, control, british, somaliland, this, somaliland, protectorate, was, just, opposite, the, british, colony, of, aden, on, the, arabian, peninsula, with, these, territories, secured, britain, was, able, to, serve, as, gatekeeper, of, the, sea, lane, leading, to, british, india, in, 1890, beginning, with, the, purchase, of, the, small, port, town, of, asseb, from, a, local, sultan, in, eritrea, the, italians, colonized, all, of, eritrea, in, 1895, from, bases, in, somalia, and, eritrea, the, italians, launched, the, first, italo, ethiopian, war, against, the, orthodox, empire, of, ethiopia, by, 1896, the, war, had, become, a, total, disaster, for, the, italians, and, ethiopia, was, able, to, retain, its, independence, ethiopia, remained, independent, until, 1936, when, after, the, second, italo, abyssinian, war, it, became, part, of, italian, east, africa, the, italian, occupation, of, ethiopia, ended, in, 1941, during, world, war, ii, as, part, of, the, east, african, campaign, the, french, also, staked, out, an, east, african, outpost, on, the, route, to, french, indochina, starting, in, the, 1850s, the, small, protectorate, of, djibouti, became, french, somaliland, in, 1897, since, the, end, of, colonialism, several, east, african, countries, have, been, riven, with,

renowned, for, their, concentrations, of, wild, animals, such, as, the, big, five, the, elephant, buffalo, lion, black, rhinoceros, and, leopard, though, populations, have, been, declining, under, increased, stress, in, recent, times, particularly, those, of, the, rhino, and, elephant, the, geography, of, east, africa, is, often, stunning, and, scenic, shaped, by, global, plate, tectonic, forces, that, have, created, the, east, african, rift, east, africa, is, the, site, of, mount, kilimanjaro, and, mount, kenya, the, two, tallest, peaks, in, africa, it, also, includes, the, world, s,

wolaytta, branches, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, niger, congo, languages, of, the, bantu, branch, are, most, widely, spoken, among, these, languages, are, kikuyu, luhya, kinyarwanda, kirundi, kisukuma, luganda, and, many, others, swahili, with, at, least, 80, million, speakers, as, a, first, or, second, language, is, an, important, trade, language, in, the, great, lakes, area, it, has, official, status, in, tanzania, kenya, and, uganda, nilotic, languages, such, as, luo, kalenjin, maasai, and, nuer, are, spoken, in, lesser, numbers, primarily, in, the, african, great, lakes, and, nile, valley, indo, european, languages, such, as, english, french, portuguese, and, italian, remain, important, in, higher, institutions, in, some, parts, of, the, larger, region, east, africa, has, a, diverse, climate, that, consists, of, hot, dry, desert, regions, cooler, regions, and, highlands, its, climate, generally, is, rather, atypical, of, equatorial, regions, being, mostly, arid, or, semi, arid, with, rainfall, totals, across, much, of, the, lowland, regions, below, 600, millimetres, or, 24, inches, per, year, in, fact, on, the, northern, coast, of, somalia, annual, rainfall, is, less, than, 100, millimetres, or, 4, inches, and, many, years, can, go, by, without, any, rain, whatsoever, the, causes, of, the, low, rainfall, totals, are, not, fully, understood, one, factor, is, presence, of, the, somali, jet, a, fast, wind, system, in, boreal, summer, which, brings, cool, southern, hemisphere, air, into, east, africa, a, second, cause, is, the, presence, of, east, to, west, river, valleys, in, the, east, african, rift, which, channel, strong, moisture, laden, winds, from, the, indian, ocean, away, from, east, africa, and, towards, the, congo, basin, rainforest, rainfall, generally, increases, towards, the, south, and, with, altitude, being, around, 400, mm, 16, in, at, mogadishu, and, 1, 200, mm, 47, in, at, mombasa, on, the, coast, whilst, inland, it, increases, from, around, 130, mm, 5, in, at, garoowe, to, over, 1, 100, mm, 43, in, at, moshi, near, kilimanjaro, rainfall, in, most, of, east, africa, east, of, the, rwenzoris, and, ethiopian, highlands, is, characterised, by, two, main, rainfall, seasons, the, long, rains, from, march, to, may, and, the, short, rains, from, october, to, december, this, is, usually, attributed, to, the, passage, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, across, the, region, in, those, months, but, it, may, also, be, analogous, to, the, autumn, monsoon, rains, of, parts, of, sri, lanka, vietnam, and, the, brazilian, nordeste, west, of, the, mountains, the, rainfall, pattern, is, more, typically, tropical, with, rain, throughout, the, year, near, the, equator, and, a, single, wet, season, in, most, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, from, june, to, september, contracting, to, july, and, august, around, asmara, annual, rainfall, here, ranges, from, over, 1, 600, mm, 63, in, on, the, western, slopes, to, around, 1, 250, mm, 49, in, at, addis, ababa, and, 550, mm, 22, in, at, asmara, in, the, high, mountains, rainfall, can, be, over, 2, 500, millimetres, or, 100, inches, rainfall, variability, is, influenced, by, both, el, ni, o, events, and, a, positive, indian, ocean, dipole, el, ni, o, events, tend, to, increase, rainfall, except, in, the, northern, and, western, parts, of, the, ethiopian, and, eritrean, highlands, where, they, produce, drought, and, poor, nile, floods, similarly, a, positive, indian, ocean, dipole, result, in, warm, sea, surface, temperatures, off, the, coast, of, east, africa, and, lead, to, increased, rainfall, over, east, africa, temperatures, in, east, africa, except, on, the, hot, and, generally, humid, coastal, belt, are, moderate, with, maxima, of, around, 25, c, 77, f, and, minima, of, 15, c, 59, f, at, an, altitude, of, 1, 500, metres, 4, 921, ft, at, altitudes, of, above, 2, 500, metres, 8, 200, ft, frosts, are, common, during, the, dry, season, and, maxima, typically, about, 21, c, 70, f, or, less, the, largest, tectonic, movement, in, east, africa, is, the, east, african, rift, both, the, somali, plate, and, nubian, plate, are, separating, at, 7mm, per, annum, there, are, movies, that, have, depicted, east, africa, in, various, forms, 7, days, in, entebbe, the, last, king, of, scotland, out, of, africa, queen, of, katwe, the, constant, gardener, hotel, rwanda, the, good, lie, and, captain, phillips, are, a, few, of, the, critically, acclaimed, movies, in, the, video, games, halo, 2, and, halo, 3, east, africa, is, one, of, the, central, locations, for, the, campaigns
