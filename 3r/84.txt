the, white, sea, russian, romanized, beloye, more, karelian, and, finnish, vienanmeri, lit, dvina, sea, nenets, romanized, serako, yam, is, a, southern, inlet, of, the, barents, sea, located, on, the, northwest, coast, of, russia, it, is, surrounded, by, karelia, to, the, west, the, kola, peninsula, to, the, north, and, the, kanin, peninsula, to, the, northeast, the, whole, of, the, white, sea, is, under, russian, sovereignty, and, considered, to, be, part, of, the, internal, waters, of, russia, administratively, it, is, divided, between, the, arkhangelsk, and, murmansk, oblasts, and, the, republic, of, karelia, the, major, port, of, arkhangelsk, is, located, on, the, white, sea, for, much, of, russia, s, history, this, was, russia, s, main, centre, of, international, maritime, trade, conducted, by, the, pomors, seaside, settlers, from, kholmogory, in, the, modern, era, it, became, an, important, soviet, naval, and, submarine, base, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, connects, the, white, sea, with, the, baltic, sea, the, white, sea, is, one, of, the, four, seas, named, not, only, in, english, after, common, colour, terms, the, others, being, the, black, red, and, yellow, seas, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, northern, limit, of, the, white, sea, as, a, line, joining, svyatoy, nos, murmansk, coast, 39, 47, e, and, cape, kanin, there, are, four, main, bays, or, gulfs, on, the, white, sea, these, bays, connect, with, the, funnel, shaped, opening, to, the, barents, sea, via, a, narrow, strait, called, gorlo, russian, meaning, throat, kandalaksha, gulf, lies, in, the, western, part, of, the, white, sea, it, is, the, deepest, part, of, the, sea, reaching, 340, metres, 1, 115, feet, on, the, south, onega, bay, receives, the, onega, river, to, the, southeast, the, dvina, bay, receives, the, northern, dvina, at, the, major, port, of, arkhangelsk, on, the, east, side, of, the, gorlo, opposite, to, the, kola, peninsula, is, mezen, bay, it, receives, the, mezen, river, and, the, kuloy, river, other, major, rivers, flowing, into, the, sea, are, the, vyg, niva, umba, varzuga, and, ponoy, the, seabed, of, the, central, part, and, dvina, bay, is, covered, in, silt, and, sand, whereas, the, bottom, of, the, northern, part, the, kandalaksha, gulf, and, onega, bay, is, a, mixture, of, sand, and, stones, ice, age, deposits, often, emerge, near, the, sea, shores, northwestern, coasts, are, tall, and, rocky, but, the, slope, is, much, weaker, at, the, southeastern, side, the, white, sea, contains, a, large, number, of, islands, but, most, of, them, are, small, the, main, island, group, is, the, solovetsky, islands, located, almost, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, near, the, entrance, to, onega, bay, kiy, island, in, onega, bay, is, significant, due, to, a, historic, monastery, velikiy, island, located, close, to, the, shore, is, the, largest, island, in, the, kandalaksha, gulf, the, white, sea, is, a, water, filled, depression, in, the, block, of, a, continental, shelf, known, as, the, baltic, shield, its, bottom, is, very, uneven, and, contains, the, kandalaksha, hollow, in, the, northwest, and, the, solovetsky, islands, in, the, south, also, the, onega, bay, has, many, small, underwater, elevations, the, opening, and, the, gorlo, of, the, sea, are, rather, shallow, with, depths, about, 50, metres, or, less, there, is, an, underwater, ridge, in, the, northern, part, of, the, gorlo, resulting, in, maximum, depths, of, 40, metres, in, that, part, this, hinders, water, exchange, between, the, white, and, barents, seas, the, exchange, is, assisted, by, the, tides, which, are, semidiurnal, rising, twice, a, day, with, the, amplitude, increasing, from, 1, metre, on, the, south, to, 10, metres, in, mezen, bay, currents, are, rather, weak, in, the, open, seas, with, the, speed, below, 1, km, h, but, they, significantly, strengthen, in, the, bays, the, tidal, waves, are, much, faster, than, the, regular, currents, and, reach, the, speeds, of, 9, km, h, in, mezen, bay, 3, 6, km, h, in, onega, bay, and, 1, 3, km, h, in, the, kandalaksha, gulf, rivers, bring, annually, about, 215, km, 3, of, fresh, water, on, average, mostly, to, the, onega, mezen, and, dvina, bays, the, northern, dvina, alone, may, contribute, up, to, 171, km, 3, in, some, years, with, the, mezen, onega, kem, and, vyg, rivers, adding, up, to, 38, 5, 27, 0, 12, 5, and, 11, 5, km, 3, respectively, about, 40, of, this, volume, is, brought, during, the, snow, melting, in, may, and, the, inflow, is, minimal, in, february, march, this, inflow, raises, and, lowers, the, sea, level, that, promotes, the, water, exchange, with, the, barents, sea, as, a, result, annually, about, 2, 000, km, 3, and, 2, 200, km, 3, flow, in, and, out, of, the, white, sea, respectively, the, inflow, of, fresh, water, in, spring, decreases, the, surface, salinity, in, the, top, 5, 10, metre, layer, to, 23, parts, per, thousand, in, the, eastern, and, 26, 27, in, the, western, parts, of, the, sea, reaching, 10, 12, in, dvina, bay, it, also, increases, the, content, of, silicon, and, silicates, in, water, which, is, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, white, sea, storms, are, the, strongest, in, october, november, shallow, sea, depths, reduce, the, wave, height, to, the, average, of, 1, metre, sometimes, reaching, 3, 5, metres, the, sea, is, quiet, in, july, august, the, climate, varies, between, polar, and, subarctic, with, frequent, fogs, and, clouds, winds, are, predominantly, southwestern, in, winter, with, speeds, of, 4, 8, m, s, they, bring, cold, air, from, the, south, establishing, the, temperature, of, about, 15, c, february, over, most, of, the, sea, the, northern, part, is, warmer, at, about, 9, c, sometimes, reaching, 6, c, due, to, the, warm, air, masses, from, the, atlantic, arctic, anticyclones, however, change, winds, to, the, northeastern, ones, bringing, much, colder, weather, with, temperatures, of, about, 25, c, summers, are, cold, cloudy, and, relatively, humid, with, northeastern, winds, and, frequent, rains, average, july, temperatures, are, 8, 10, c, occasional, southeastern, winds, bring, warm, air, from, europe, raising, the, temperature, to, 17, 19, c, and, sometimes, even, to, 30, c, annual, precipitations, increase, from, 282, mm, in, the, north, 529, in, the, south, in, winter, from, october, november, to, april, may, the, sea, freezes, with, the, average, january, water, temperatures, of, 1, 9, c, in, the, north, between, 1, 3, and, 1, 7, in, the, centre, and, between, 0, 5, and, 0, 7, in, the, bays, these, variations, are, due, to, the, distribution, of, water, salinity, across, the, sea, which, increases, from, 24, to, 26, in, the, centre, to, 30, 5, in, the, gorlo, reaching, 34, 0, 34, 5, toward, the, barents, sea, the, freezing, period, varies, from, year, to, year, as, shown, in, the, satellite, image, to, the, right, the, ice, is, not, stationary, but, 90, of, it, is, floating, and, is, continuously, removed, to, the, barents, sea, ice, thickness, is, usually, about, 40, cm, but, may, reach, 150, cm, in, cold, winters, in, summer, surface, water, warms, up, to, 15, in, the, central, part, but, remains, relatively, cold, in, the, north, at, 7, 8, due, to, the, water, exchange, between, the, surface, and, the, cold, bottom, part, which, is, enhanced, by, the, shallow, depths, in, the, northern, parts, deep, sea, about, 100, m, or, more, is, characterised, by, stable, temperature, 1, 4, and, salinity, 30, the, depth, distribution, of, water, temperature, is, very, inhomogeneous, across, the, sea, for, example, at, the, exit, from, dvina, bay, water, temperature, drops, to, 0, c, at, the, depth, of, only, 12, 15, m, but, the, same, temperature, is, reached, at, 65, m, at, the, exit, from, the, kandalaksha, gulf, residents, of, novgorod, knew, of, the, white, sea, from, at, least, the, 11th, century, and, rapidly, explored, its, commercial, significance, for, navigation, and, its, coastal, forests, rich, in, fur, animals, one, of, the, earliest, settlements, near, the, sea, shores, grew, up, in, the, late, 14th, century, at, kholmogory, on, the, northern, dvina, from, there, in, 1492, a, merchant, fleet, laden, with, grain, and, carrying, ambassadors, of, ivan, iii, of, russia, sailed, to, denmark, marking, the, establishment, of, the, first, international, seaport, in, russia, the, first, foreign, ship, to, arrive, in, kholmogory, was, the, english, edward, bonaventure, commanded, by, richard, chancellor, in, 1553, together, with, two, other, ships, under, the, command, of, hugh, willoughby, his, crew, had, sought, a, northern, route, to, the, indies, especially, india, and, china, the, expedition, sponsored, by, king, edward, vi, of, england, and, a, group, of, about, 240, english, merchants, had, london, s, authorisation, to, establish, trade, connections, the, ships, of, willoughby, were, separated, and, the, other, two, were, lost, at, sea, but, edward, bonaventure, managed, to, pass, the, white, sea, and, reach, kholmogory, from, where, chancellor, was, escorted, to, moscow, to, meet, the, russian, tsar, ivan, iv, returning, from, russia, in, 1554, chancellor, brought, back, a, detailed, description, of, moscow, and, the, russian, north, which, were, largely, unknown, to, europe, as, well, as, a, letter, from, the, tsar, expressing, desire, to, establish, trade, relations, with, england, in, 1555, queen, mary, issued, a, charter, authorising, the, muscovy, company, to, trade, with, russia, via, the, white, sea, route, dutch, ships, soon, followed, the, english, and, the, port, of, kholmogory, became, busy, with, shipments, of, fur, and, fish, local, and, foreign, shops, and, factories, were, established, in, the, city, at, that, time, the, port, was, reinforced, with, a, fortress, which, sustained, a, siege, by, the, polish, lithuanian, army, in, 1613, increasing, traffic, overloaded, the, port, which, relied, on, shallow, river, waters, and, had, limited, ship, capacity, however, instead, of, expanding, the, old, port, ivan, iv, established, a, new, one, down, river, in, 1584, called, new, kholmogory, which, from, 1596, began, to, become, known, as, arkhangelsk, between, the, 15th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, white, sea, served, as, the, major, trade, route, in, and, out, of, russia, this, role, decreased, later, after, the, foundation, of, saint, petersburg, 1703, which, opened, a, more, direct, ice, free, connection, between, russia, and, the, bulk, of, western, europe, via, the, baltic, sea, from, the, 1920s, most, northern, russian, sea, shipments, diverted, from, the, white, sea, to, the, new, port, of, murmansk, officially, founded, in, 1916, where, the, waters, did, not, freeze, in, winter, the, entire, water, area, of, the, white, sea, is, the, territorial, waters, of, the, russian, federation, any, movement, of, foreign, vessels, on, the, white, sea, is, carried, out, in, accordance, with, the, legislation, of, the, russian, federation, the, sea, hosts, more, than, 700, species, of, invertebrates, about, 60, species, of, fish, and, five, species, of, marine, mammals, including, the, friendly, beluga, and, the, white, whale, several, other, dolphin, species, such, as, harbour, porpoises, appear, less, frequently, while, larger, whales, such, as, bowhead, humpback, and, rorquals, northern, bottlenose, orcas, have, been, considered, as, rare, visitors, to, the, waters, while, actual, frequency, of, occurrences, within, white, sea, basin, is, not, specified, the, fishing, industry, is, relatively, small, mostly, targeting, harp, seal, ringed, seal, herring, saffron, cod, european, smelt, atlantic, cod, and, atlantic, salmon, there, is, a, developing, seaweed, industry, the, white, sea, is, an, important, traffic, centre, of, northwestern, russia, interconnecting, various, economic, regions, and, providing, an, outlet, to, the, foreign, routes, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, links, it, through, lake, onega, to, the, baltic, sea, and, the, major, city, and, port, of, saint, petersburg, the, baltic, sea, in, turn, is, connected, by, the, volga, baltic, waterway, to, the, volga, river, black, caspian, and, azov, seas, the, major, ports, on, the, white, sea, are, arkhangelsk, belomorsk, onega, mezen, kem, kandalaksha, and, umba, despite, being, frozen, in, winter, the, sea, remains, navigable, all, year, around, because, of, deployment, of, icebreakers
