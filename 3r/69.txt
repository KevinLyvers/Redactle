the, yellow, sea, also, known, as, north, sea, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, western, pacific, ocean, located, between, mainland, china, and, the, korean, peninsula, and, can, be, considered, the, northwestern, part, of, the, east, china, sea, since, november, 1, 2018, the, yellow, sea, has, served, as, the, location, of, peace, zones, between, north, and, south, korea, it, is, one, of, four, seas, named, after, color, terms, the, others, being, the, black, sea, the, red, sea, and, the, white, sea, and, its, name, is, descriptive, of, the, golden, yellow, color, of, the, silt, ridden, water, discharged, from, major, rivers, the, innermost, bay, of, northwestern, yellow, sea, is, called, the, bohai, sea, previously, gulf, of, zhili, beizhili, into, which, flow, some, of, the, most, important, rivers, of, northern, china, such, as, the, yellow, river, through, shandong, province, and, its, capital, jinan, the, hai, river, through, beijing, and, tianjin, and, the, liao, river, through, liaoning, province, the, northeastern, extension, of, the, yellow, sea, is, called, the, korea, bay, into, which, flow, the, yalu, river, the, chongchon, river, and, the, taedong, river, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, yellow, sea, hwang, hai, as, follows, the, yellow, sea, is, separated, from, the, sea, of, japan, by, the, boundary, from, the, southern, end, of, haenam, peninsula, in, jeollanamdo, to, jeju, island, and, divided, into, the, east, china, sea, by, the, boundary, from, the, west, end, of, jeju, island, to, the, yangtze, river, estuary, the, yellow, sea, excluding, the, bohai, extends, by, about, 960, km, 600, mi, from, north, to, south, and, about, 700, km, 430, mi, from, east, to, west, it, has, an, area, of, approximately, 380, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, and, a, volume, of, about, 17, 000, km, 3, 4, 100, cu, mi, its, depth, is, only, 44, m, 144, ft, on, average, with, a, maximum, of, 152, m, 499, ft, the, sea, is, a, flooded, section, of, continental, shelf, that, formed, after, the, last, glacial, period, some, 10, 000, years, ago, as, sea, levels, rose, 120, m, 390, ft, to, their, current, levels, the, depth, gradually, increases, from, north, to, south, the, sea, bottom, and, shores, are, dominated, by, sand, and, silt, brought, by, the, rivers, through, the, bohai, sea, liao, river, yellow, river, hai, he, and, the, korea, bay, yalu, river, these, deposits, together, with, sand, storms, are, responsible, for, the, yellowish, colour, of, the, water, referenced, in, the, sea, s, name, the, sea, annually, receives, so, much, sand, and, silt, from, rivers, such, as, the, yellow, river, that, it, actually, turns, into, a, golden, yellow, colour, the, seas, surrounding, korea, which, occupy, a, corner, of, northeast, asia, border, the, island, nation, from, the, east, south, and, west, korea, has, named, these, the, east, sea, south, sea, and, west, sea, officially, known, as, the, yellow, sea, respectively, major, islands, of, the, sea, include, anmado, baengnyeongdo, daebudo, deokjeokdo, gageodo, ganghwado, hauido, heuksando, hongdo, jejudo, jindo, muuido, sido, silmido, sindo, wando, yeongjongdo, and, yeonpyeongdo, all, in, south, korea, the, area, has, cold, dry, winters, with, strong, northernly, monsoons, blowing, from, late, november, to, march, average, january, temperatures, are, 10, c, 14, f, in, the, north, and, 3, c, 37, f, in, the, south, summers, are, wet, and, warm, with, frequent, typhoons, between, june, and, october, air, temperatures, range, between, 10, and, 28, c, 50, and, 82, f, the, average, annual, precipitation, increases, from, about, 500, mm, 20, in, in, the, north, to, 1, 000, mm, 39, in, in, the, south, fog, is, frequent, along, the, coasts, especially, in, the, upwelling, cold, water, areas, the, sea, has, a, warm, cyclone, current, forming, part, of, the, kuroshio, current, which, diverges, near, the, western, part, of, japan, and, flows, northward, into, the, yellow, sea, at, a, speed, of, less, than, 0, 8, km, h, 0, 50, mph, southward, currents, prevail, near, the, sea, coast, especially, in, the, winter, monsoon, period, the, water, temperature, is, close, to, freezing, in, the, northern, part, in, winter, so, drift, ice, patches, and, continuous, ice, fields, form, and, hinder, navigation, between, november, and, march, the, water, temperature, and, salinity, are, homogeneous, across, the, depth, the, southern, waters, are, warmer, at, 6, 8, c, 43, 46, f, in, spring, and, summer, the, upper, layer, is, warmed, up, by, the, sun, and, diluted, by, the, fresh, water, from, rivers, while, the, deeper, water, remains, cold, and, saline, this, deep, water, stagnates, and, slowly, moves, south, commercial, bottom, dwelling, fishes, are, found, around, this, mass, of, water, especially, at, its, southern, part, summer, temperatures, range, between, 22, and, 28, c, 72, and, 82, f, the, average, salinity, is, relatively, low, at, 30, in, the, north, to, 33, 34, in, the, south, dropping, to, 26, or, lower, near, the, river, deltas, in, the, southwest, monsoon, season, june, to, august, the, increased, rainfall, and, runoff, further, reduce, the, salinity, of, the, upper, sea, layer, water, transparency, increases, from, about, 10, meters, 33, ft, in, the, north, up, to, 45, meters, 148, ft, in, the, south, tides, are, semidiurnal, i, e, rise, twice, a, day, their, amplitude, varies, between, about, 0, 9, and, 3, meters, 3, 0, and, 9, 8, ft, at, the, coast, of, china, tides, are, higher, at, the, korean, peninsula, typically, ranging, between, 4, and, 8, meters, 13, and, 26, ft, and, reaching, the, maximum, in, spring, the, tidal, system, rotates, in, a, counterclockwise, direction, the, speed, of, the, tidal, current, is, generally, less, than, 1, 6, km, h, 0, 99, mph, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, but, may, increase, to, more, than, 5, 6, km, h, 3, 5, mph, near, the, coasts, the, fastest, tides, reaching, 20, km, h, 12, mph, occur, in, the, myeongnyang, strait, between, jindo, island, and, the, korean, peninsula, the, tide, related, sea, level, variations, result, in, a, land, pass, 2, 9, km, 1, 8, mi, long, and, 10, 40, meters, 33, 131, ft, wide, opening, for, approximately, an, hour, between, jindo, and, modo, islands, the, event, occurs, about, twice, a, year, at, the, beginning, of, may, and, in, the, middle, of, june, it, had, long, been, celebrated, in, a, local, festival, called, jindo, sea, parting, festival, but, was, largely, unknown, to, the, outside, world, until, 1975, when, the, french, ambassador, pierre, randi, described, the, phenomenon, in, a, french, newspaper, the, sea, is, rich, in, seaweed, predominantly, kelp, laminaria, japonica, cephalopods, crustaceans, shellfish, clams, and, especially, in, blue, green, algae, which, bloom, in, summer, and, contribute, to, the, water, color, see, image, above, for, example, the, seaweed, production, in, the, area, was, as, high, as, 1, 5, million, tonnes, in, 1979, for, china, alone, the, abundance, of, all, these, plant, and, animal, species, increases, toward, the, south, and, indicates, a, high, sea, productivity, accounting, for, the, diversity, of, fish, species, and, high, fish, yield, from, the, sea, several, species, of, goby, new, to, science, have, been, discovered, recently, in, the, yellow, sea, the, southern, part, of, the, yellow, sea, including, the, entire, west, coast, of, korea, contains, a, 10, km, wide, 6, 2, mi, belt, of, intertidal, mudflats, which, has, the, total, area, of, 2, 850, km, 2, 1, 100, sq, mi, and, is, maintained, by, 4, 10, m, 13, 33, ft, those, flats, consist, of, highly, productive, sediments, with, a, rich, benthic, fauna, and, are, of, great, importance, for, migratory, waders, and, shorebirds, surveys, show, that, the, area, is, the, single, most, important, site, for, migratory, birds, on, northward, migration, in, the, entire, east, asian, australasian, flyway, with, more, than, 35, species, occurring, in, internationally, significant, numbers, two, million, birds, at, minimum, pass, through, at, the, time, and, about, half, that, number, use, it, on, southward, migration, about, 300, 000, migrating, birds, were, transiting, annually, only, through, the, saemangeum, tidal, flat, area, this, estuary, was, however, dammed, by, south, korea, in, 1991, 2006, that, resulted, in, drying, off, the, land, land, reclamation, also, took, 65, of, the, intertidal, area, of, china, north, korea, and, south, korea, between, the, 1950s, and, 2002, and, as, of, 2005, there, were, plans, to, reclaim, a, further, 45, populations, of, oceanic, megafauna, such, as, marine, mammals, sea, turtles, and, larger, fish, have, decreased, in, modern, times, not, only, due, to, pollution, but, also, due, to, hunting, japanese, industrial, whaling, and, illegal, mass, operations, by, the, soviet, union, with, support, from, japan, have, been, major, drivers, of, population, decline, species, that, reside, in, the, area, today, include, spotted, seals, and, cetaceans, such, as, minke, whales, killer, whales, false, killer, whales, and, finless, porpoises, but, nonetheless, all, the, remnants, of, species, listed, could, be, in, very, small, numbers, historically, large, whales, were, very, abundant, either, for, summering, and, wintering, in, the, yellow, and, bohai, seas, for, example, a, unique, population, of, resident, fin, whales, and, gray, whales, were, historically, presented, or, possibly, hosted, some, north, pacific, right, whales, and, humpback, whales, 3, whales, including, a, cow, calf, pair, was, observed, at, changhai, county, in, 2015, year, round, other, than, migrating, individuals, and, many, other, migratory, species, such, as, baird, s, beaked, whales, even, blue, whales, japanese, sea, lions, dugongs, in, southern, regions, only, and, leatherback, turtles, used, to, breed, or, migrate, into, yellow, and, bohai, seas, spotted, seals, are, the, only, resident, species, of, seal, in, the, yellow, sea, a, sanctuary, for, these, seals, is, situated, at, baengnyeongdo, which, is, also, known, for, its, finless, porpoises, great, white, sharks, have, also, been, known, to, prey, on, seals, in, the, area, the, coasts, of, the, yellow, sea, are, very, densely, populated, at, approximately, 250, inhabitants, per, square, kilometer, 650, sq, mi, the, sea, waters, had, been, used, for, fishing, by, the, chinese, korean, and, japanese, ships, for, centuries, especially, rich, in, fish, are, the, bottom, layers, about, 200, fish, species, are, exploited, commercially, especially, sea, bream, croakers, lizard, fishes, prawns, cutlassfish, horse, mackerel, squid, eel, filefish, pacific, herring, chub, mackerel, flounder, and, jellyfish, the, intensity, of, fishing, has, been, gradually, increasing, for, china, and, korea, and, decreasing, for, japan, for, example, the, production, volumes, for, china, rose, from, 619, 000, tonnes, in, 1985, to, 1, 984, 400, tonnes, in, 1996, all, species, are, overfished, however, and, while, the, total, catchments, are, rising, the, fish, population, is, continuously, declining, for, most, species, navigation, is, another, traditional, activity, in, the, yellow, sea, the, main, chinese, ports, are, dalian, tianjin, qingdao, and, qinhuangdao, the, major, south, korean, ports, on, the, yellow, sea, are, incheon, gunsan, and, mokpo, and, that, for, north, korea, is, nampho, the, outport, of, pyongyang, the, bohai, train, ferry, provides, a, shortcut, between, the, liaodong, peninsula, and, shandong, a, major, naval, accident, occurred, on, 24, november, 1999, at, yantai, shandong, china, when, the, 9, 000, ton, chinese, ferry, dashun, caught, fire, and, capsized, in, rough, seas, about, 300, people, were, killed, making, it, the, worst, maritime, incident, in, china, oil, exploration, has, been, successful, in, the, chinese, and, north, korean, portions, of, the, sea, with, the, proven, and, estimated, reserves, of, about, 9, and, 20, billion, tonnes, respectively, however, the, study, and, exploration, of, the, sea, is, somewhat, hindered, by, insufficient, sharing, of, information, between, the, involved, countries, china, initiated, collaborations, with, foreign, oil, companies, in, 1979, but, this, initiative, declined, later, a, major, oil, spill, occurred, on, 16, july, 2010, when, a, pipeline, exploded, at, the, north, east, port, of, dalian, causing, a, wide, scale, fire, and, spreading, about, 1, 500, tonnes, of, oil, over, the, sea, area, of, 430, km, 2, 170, sq, mi, the, port, had, been, closed, and, fishing, suspended, until, the, end, of, august, eight, hundred, fishing, boats, and, 40, specialized, vessels, were, mobilized, to, relieve, the, environmental, damage, the, yellow, sea, is, considered, among, the, most, degraded, marine, areas, on, earth, loss, of, natural, coastal, habitats, due, to, land, reclamation, has, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, more, than, 60, of, tidal, wetlands, around, the, yellow, sea, coastline, in, approximately, 50, years, rapid, coastal, development, for, agriculture, aquaculture, and, industrial, development, are, considered, the, primary, drivers, of, coastal, destruction, in, the, region, this, degree, of, loss, of, area, widespread, pollution, algal, blooms, and, declines, of, invertebrate, and, vertebrate, fauna, have, resulted, in, the, classification, of, this, ecosystem, as, endangered, in, addition, to, land, reclamation, the, yellow, sea, ecosystem, is, facing, several, other, serious, environmental, problems, pollution, is, widespread, and, deterioration, of, pelagic, and, benthic, habitat, quality, has, occurred, and, harmful, algal, blooms, frequently, occur, invasion, of, introduced, species, are, having, a, detrimental, effect, on, the, yellow, sea, environment, there, are, 25, intentionally, introduced, species, and, 9, unintentionally, introduced, species, in, the, yellow, sea, large, marine, ecosystem, declines, of, biodiversity, fisheries, and, ecosystem, services, in, the, yellow, sea, are, widespread, the, tidal, flats, of, the, yellow, sea, are, considered, endangered, on, 1, november, 2018, officials, from, south, korea, s, ministry, of, national, defense, confirmed, that, peace, zones, had, been, established, by, the, north, and, south, korean, militaries, in, the, yellow, sea, area, that, touches, the, north, and, south, korean, demarcation, line, a, buffer, zone, was, also, created, in, the, yellow, sea, s, northern, limit, line, nll
