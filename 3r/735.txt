1824, shortly, before, its, merger, with, west, prussia, the, population, of, east, prussia, was, 1, 080, 000, people, according, to, karl, andree, germans, were, slightly, more, than, half, of, the, people, while, 280, 000, 26, were, ethnically, polish, and, 200, 000, 19, were, ethnically, lithuanian, as, of, 1819, there, were, also, 20, 000, strong, ethnic, curonian, and, latvian, minorities, as, well, as, 2, 400, jews, according, to, georg, hassel, similar, numbers, are, given, by, august, von, haxthausen, in, his, 1839, book, with, a, breakdown, by, county, however, the, majority, of, east, prussian, polish, and, lithuanian, inhabitants, were, lutherans, not, catholics, like, their, ethnic, kinsmen, across, the, border, in, the, russian, empire, only, in, southern, warmia, catholic, poles, so, called, warmians, not, to, be, confused, with, predominantly, protestant, masurians, comprised, the, majority, of, population, numbering, 26, 067, people, 81, in, county, allenstein, polish, olsztyn, in, 1837, in, the, 19th, century, east, prussia, was, commonly, viewed, by, german, commentators, as, culturally, backwards, and, a, part, of, the, german, mission, in, the, east, rather, than, a, core, german, territory, pan, germanist, politician, ernst, hasse, criticised, the, lack, of, folk, identity, and, imagined, community, it, is, the, case, that, there, is, almost, no, common, folk, identity, among, the, poseners, and, prussians, at, all, who, can, recognise, a, posener, or, prussian, by, dialect, and, character, distinct, features, hardly, exist, while, the, north, of, east, prussia, was, overwhelmingly, german, the, south, was, majority, slavic, and, mostly, composed, of, poles, and, masurians, there, was, also, a, slight, lithuanian, majority, in, the, north, eastern, area, of, east, prussia, lithuania, minor, regional, and, local, identities, were, particularly, strong, in, east, prussia, local, polish, population, often, identified, with, masuria, rather, than, poland, and, prussian, lithuanians, also, did, not, actively, identify, themselves, with, the, lithuanian, nation, moreover, confessional, identity, often, prevailed, over, the, national, one, german, authorities, were, concerned, about, the, catholic, polish, axis, german, catholics, were, alienated, from, the, german, nation, because, of, the, kulturkampf, legislation, and, tended, to, support, the, polish, national, movement, an, east, german, newspaper, thorner, zeitung, reported, in, 1871, that, not, only, polish, catholics, but, also, a, great, number, of, german, catholics, are, willing, to, vote, for, a, polish, party, candidate, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, east, prussia, had, a, significant, polish, minority, and, german, nationalist, circles, warned, of, the, prospect, of, polonization, of, east, prussia, the, perceived, weakness, of, germanness, of, east, prussia, was, also, reinforced, by, the, ostflucht, as, east, prussia, suffered, from, both, under, industrialisation, and, rural, overpopulation, after, 1876, farm, prices, in, east, prussia, fell, by, 20, percent, which, encouraged, local, landowners, to, hire, foreign, workers, from, congress, poland, incidentally, strengthening, the, polish, element, in, the, region, the, increased, slavic, immigration, to, the, region, generated, by, the, requirement, of, the, junkers, for, cheap, labour, and, better, economic, conditions, in, west, germany, caused, many, german, inhabitants, to, leave, the, region, most, germans, moved, to, work, in, the, industrial, heartland, of, western, germany, while, others, migrated, abroad, poles, and, lithuanians, of, east, prussia, also, had, much, higher, birth, rate, and, natural, increase, rates, than, the, germans, and, rarely, emigrated, discussing, the, situation, in, east, prussia, polish, geographer, stanis, aw, srokowski, remarked, the, poles, who, live, in, the, southern, and, western, parts, of, east, prussia, and, the, lithuanians, of, the, north, west, have, succeeded, better, than, the, germans, in, reconciling, their, mode, of, life, with, their, earnings, this, has, of, course, led, to, a, lower, standard, of, life, but, it, has, enabled, them, to, adapt, themselves, to, actual, conditions, and, even, to, prosper, where, the, germans, fail, moreover, both, these, national, minorities, in, east, prussia, are, bound, to, the, soil, by, centuries, of, tradition, they, are, not, comparative, new, comers, like, the, majority, of, the, germans, there, for, these, reasons, the, poles, and, lithuanians, in, that, province, hardly, ever, emigrate, from, the, land, of, their, birth, especially, as, the, emigration, in, question, is, not, so, attractive, for, them, as, for, the, germans, proceeding, to, central, or, western, germany, the, former, would, really, be, going, to, a, foreign, country, amongst, people, not, speaking, their, language, and, having, other, customs, than, theirs, the, memel, territory, klaip, da, region, formerly, part, of, northeastern, east, prussia, as, well, as, prussian, lithuania, was, annexed, by, lithuania, in, 1923, in, 1938, nazi, germany, radically, renamed, about, a, third, of, the, place, names, of, this, area, replacing, old, prussian, and, lithuanian, names, with, newly, invented, german, names, in, september, 1914, after, hostilities, began, between, germany, on, the, one, hand, and, france, and, russia, on, the, other, the, german, army, was, about, to, seize, paris, and, the, french, urged, russia, to, attack, east, prussia, nicholas, ii, launched, a, major, attack, resulting, in, a, russian, victory, in, the, battle, of, gumbinnen, the, russian, army, arrived, at, the, outskirts, of, the, city, of, k, nigsberg, but, did, not, take, it, and, settled, at, insterburg, this, russian, victory, and, east, prussia, s, occupation, by, russia, saved, paris, by, forcing, the, germans, to, send, many, troops, to, their, east, provinces, later, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, pushed, russia, back, at, the, battle, of, tannenberg, thereby, liberating, east, prussia, from, russian, troops, yet, russian, troops, remained, in, the, easternmost, part, of, the, region, until, early, 1915, during, world, war, ii, the, hohenbruch, concentration, camp, was, operated, at, modern, gromovo, mostly, for, polish, prisoners, as, well, as, several, subcamps, of, the, stutthof, concentration, camp, the, oflag, 52, oflag, 60, and, dulag, luft, prisoner, of, war, camps, and, a, camp, for, romani, people, in, k, nigsberg, see, romani, holocaust, on, 29, august, 1944, soviet, troops, reached, the, border, of, east, prussia, by, january, 1945, they, had, taken, all, of, east, prussia, except, for, the, area, around, k, nigsberg, many, inhabitants, fled, west, at, this, time, during, the, last, days, of, the, war, over, two, million, people, fled, anticipating, imminent, red, army, conquest, and, were, evacuated, by, sea, initially, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, the, current, southern, border, strip, passed, under, polish, control, with, polish, administration, organized, in, the, towns, of, gierdawy, and, i, awka, however, the, area, was, eventually, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, and, included, within, the, kaliningrad, oblast, under, the, potsdam, agreement, of, 1, august, 1945, the, city, became, part, of, the, soviet, union, pending, the, final, determination, of, territorial, borders, at, an, anticipated, peace, settlement, this, final, determination, eventually, took, place, on, 12, september, 1990, when, the, treaty, on, the, final, settlement, with, respect, to, germany, was, signed, the, excerpt, from, the, initial, agreement, pertaining, to, the, partition, of, east, prussia, including, the, area, surrounding, k, nigsberg, is, as, follows, note, that, k, nigsberg, is, spelt, koenigsberg, in, the, original, document, vi, city, of, koenigsberg, and, the, adjacent, area, the, conference, examined, a, proposal, by, the, soviet, government, that, pending, the, final, determination, of, territorial, questions, at, the, peace, settlement, the, section, of, the, western, frontier, of, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, which, is, adjacent, to, the, baltic, sea, should, pass, from, a, point, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, bay, of, danzig, to, the, east, north, of, braunsberg, goldep, to, the, meeting, point, of, the, frontiers, of, lithuania, the, polish, republic, and, east, prussia, the, conference, has, agreed, in, principle, to, the, proposal, of, the, soviet, government, concerning, the, ultimate, transfer, to, the, soviet, union, of, the, city, of, koenigsberg, and, the, area, adjacent, to, it, as, described, above, subject, to, expert, examination, of, the, actual, frontier, u, s, president, harry, truman, and, british, prime, minister, clement, attlee, supported, the, proposal, of, the, conference, at, the, forthcoming, peace, settlement, in, 1946, k, nigsberg, was, added, as, a, semi, exclave, to, the, russian, sfsr, and, renamed, kaliningrad, after, the, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ussr, mikhail, kalinin, kalinin, was, unrelated, to, the, city, and, there, were, already, cities, named, in, honour, of, kalinin, in, the, soviet, union, namely, kalinin, now, tver, and, kaliningrad, now, korolev, moscow, oblast, the, german, language, was, replaced, with, the, russian, language, and, the, remaining, german, population, was, expelled, between, 1947, and, 1948, the, territory, was, then, re, populated, with, soviet, citizens, mostly, ethnic, russians, but, to, a, lesser, extent, also, ukrainians, and, belarusians, some, historians, speculate, that, it, may, have, originally, been, offered, to, the, lithuanian, ssr, because, the, resolution, from, the, conference, specifies, that, kaliningrad, s, border, would, be, at, the, pre, war, lithuanian, frontier, according, to, some, historians, joseph, stalin, created, it, as, an, oblast, separate, from, the, lithuanian, ssr, because, it, further, separated, the, baltic, states, from, the, west, others, think, that, the, reason, was, that, the, region, was, far, too, strategic, for, the, ussr, to, leave, it, in, the, hands, of, another, ssr, other, than, the, russian, one, in, the, 1950s, nikita, khrushchev, offered, the, entire, kaliningrad, oblast, to, the, lithuanian, ssr, but, antanas, snie, kus, refused, to, accept, the, territory, because, it, would, add, at, least, a, million, ethnic, russians, to, lithuania, proper, in, the, soviet, era, the, city, was, completely, closed, and, with, the, exception, of, rare, visits, of, friendship, from, neighboring, poland, it, was, practically, not, visited, by, foreigners, in, 1950, there, were, 1, 165, 000, inhabitants, which, was, only, half, the, number, of, the, pre, war, population, the, old, city, was, not, restored, and, the, ruins, of, the, k, nigsberg, castle, were, demolished, in, the, late, 1960s, on, leonid, brezhnev, s, personal, orders, despite, the, protests, of, architects, historians, and, residents, of, the, city, the, reconstruction, of, the, oblast, threatened, by, hunger, in, the, immediate, post, war, years, was, carried, out, through, an, ambitious, policy, of, oceanic, fishing, with, the, creation, of, one, of, the, main, fishing, harbours, of, the, ussr, in, kaliningrad, city, fishing, not, only, fed, the, regional, economy, but, also, was, a, basis, for, social, and, scientific, development, in, particular, oceanography, from, 1953, to, 1962, a, monument, to, stalin, stood, on, victory, square, in, 1973, the, town, hall, was, turned, into, the, house, of, soviets, in, 1975, the, trolleybus, was, launched, again, in, 1980, a, concert, hall, was, opened, in, the, building, of, the, former, lutheran, church, of, the, holy, family, in, 1986, the, kreuzkirche, building, was, transferred, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, in, 1957, an, agreement, was, signed, and, later, came, into, force, which, delimited, the, border, between, the, polish, people, s, republic, a, soviet, satellite, state, at, the, time, and, the, soviet, union, in, 2010, the, german, magazine, der, spiegel, published, a, report, claiming, that, kaliningrad, had, been, offered, to, germany, in, 1990, against, payment, the, offer, was, not, seriously, considered, by, the, west, german, government, which, at, the, time, saw, reunification, with, east, germany, as, a, higher, priority, however, this, story, was, later, denied, by, mikhail, gorbachev, the, independence, of, lithuania, in, 1990, and, full, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, isolated, kaliningrad, from, the, rest, of, russia, having, previously, been, joined, by, other, soviet, republics, this, isolation, became, more, severe, when, both, poland, and, lithuania, joined, nato, and, the, european, union, and, imposed, strict, border, controls, on, kaliningrad, oblast, all, military, and, civilian, land, links, between, the, region, and, the, rest, of, russia, now, must, pass, through, members, of, nato, and, the, eu, thus, far, the, eu, has, rejected, russian, proposals, for, visa, free, travel, between, kaliningrad, and, the, rest, of, russia, travel, arrangements, based, on, the, facilitated, transit, document, ftd, and, facilitated, rail, transit, document, frtd, have, been, made, kaliningrad, oblast, s, geographic, isolation, has, badly, affected, its, economic, situation, concurrent, significant, reduction, in, the, size, of, the, russian, military, garrison, has, hurt, as, well, since, previously, the, military, was, a, major, local, employer, some, of, the, region, s, cultural, heritage, most, notably, the, k, nigsberg, cathedral, was, restored, in, the, 1990s, as, citizens, started, to, examine, previously, ignored, german, past, on, 12, january, 1996, kaliningrad, oblast, and, sverdlovsk, oblast, became, the, first, oblasts, of, russia, to, sign, a, power, sharing, treaty, with, the, federal, government, granting, them, autonomy, however, this, agreement, was, abolished, on, 31, may, 2002, after, 1991, some, ethnic, germans, emigrated, to, the, area, such, as, volga, germans, from, other, parts, of, russia, and, kazakhstan, these, germans, are, overwhelmingly, russian, speaking, and, as, such, were, rejected, for, resettlement, within, germany, under, germany, s, new, rules, a, similar, migration, by, poles, from, the, lands, of, the, former, soviet, union, to, the, kaliningrad, oblast, occurred, at, this, time, as, well, the, situation, has, begun, to, change, albeit, slowly, germany, lithuania, and, poland, have, renewed, contact, with, kaliningrad, oblast, through, town, twinning, and, other, projects, this, has, helped, to, promote, interest, in, the, history, and, culture, of, the, east, prussian, and, lietuvininkai, communities, in, july, 2007, russian, first, deputy, prime, minister, sergei, ivanov, declared, that, if, us, controlled, missile, defense, systems, were, deployed, in, poland, then, nuclear, weapons, might, be, deployed, in, kaliningrad, on, 5, november, 2008, russian, president, dmitry, medvedev, said, that, installing, missiles, in, kaliningrad, was, almost, a, certainty, these, plans, were, suspended, in, january, 2009, but, implemented, in, october, 2016, in, 2011, a, long, range, voronezh, radar, was, commissioned, to, monitor, missile, launches, within, about, 6,

kaliningradzki, to, obw, d, kr, lewiecki, kr, lewiec, being, the, historical, polish, name, for, the, city, of, kaliningrad, the, reason, given, for, the, change, is, that, mikhail, kalinin, a,
