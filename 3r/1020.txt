art, deco, and, art, nouveau, buildings, as, well, as, neo, romanian, buildings, dating, from, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, a, collection, of, modern, buildings, from, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, mostly, utilitarian, communist, era, architecture, dominates, most, southern, boroughs, recently, built, contemporary, structures, such, as, skyscrapers, and, office, buildings, complete,

medieval, and, renaissance, edifices, remain, the, most, notable, are, in, the, lipscani, area, this, precinct, contains, notable, buildings, such, as, manuc, s, inn, hanul, lui, manuc, and, the, ruins, of, the, old, court, curtea, veche, during, the, late, middle, ages, this, area, was, the, heart, of, commerce, in, bucharest, from, the, 1970s, onwards, the, area, went, through, urban, decline, and, many, historical, buildings, fell, into, disrepair, in, 2005, the, lipscani, area, was, restored, to, execute, a, massive, redevelopment, project, during, the, rule, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, the, government, conducted, extensive, demolition, of, churches, and, many, other, historic, structures, in, romania, according, to, alexandru, budi, teanu, former, chief, architect, of, bucharest, the, sight, of, a, church, bothered, ceau, escu, it, didn, t, matter, if, they, demolished, or, moved, it, as, long, as, it, was, no, longer, in, sight, nevertheless, a, project, organised, by, romanian, engineer, eugeniu, iord, chescu, was, able, to, move, many, historic, structures, to, less, prominent, sites, and, save, them, the, city, centre, has, retained, architecture, from, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, particularly, the, interwar, period, which, is, often, seen, as, the, golden, age, of, bucharest, architecture, during, this, time, the, city, grew, in, size, and, wealth, therefore, seeking, to, emulate, other, large, european, capitals, such, as, paris, much, of, the, architecture, of, the, time, belongs, to, a, modern, rationalist, architecture, current, led, by, horia, creang, and, marcel, iancu, in, romania, the, tendencies, of, innovation, in, the, architectural, language, met, the, need, of, valorisation, and, affirmation, of, the, national, cultural, identity, the, art, nouveau, movement, found, expression, through, new, architectural, style, initiated, by, ion, mincu, and, taken, over, by, other, prestigious, architects, who, capitalised, important, references, of, romanian, laic, and, medieval, ecclesiastical, architecture, for, example, the, mogo, oaia, palace, the, stavropoleos, church, or, the, disappeared, church, of, v, c, re, ti, monastery, and, romanian, folk, motifs, the, romanian, revival, architecture, which, was, born, as, the, result, of, the, attempts, of, finding, a, specific, romanian, architectural, style, is, exemplified, though, buildings, such, as, nicolae, minovici, folk, art, museum, and, the, romanian, peasant, museum, another, style, of, the, 1930s, is, the, moorish, florentine, or, mediterranean, picturesque, which, eclectically, uses, romanesque, gothic, and, renaissance, elements, in, civic, architecture, with, a, mediterranean, vibe, giving, rise, to, mediterranean, revival, architecture, some, buildings, from, the, interwar, era, have, a, modernist, brutalist, look, such, as, the, tehnoimport, building, which, was, built, in, 1935, and, may, be, mistaken, as, communist, architecture, modernist, styles, during, the, interwar, period, include, art, deco, stripped, classicism, bauhaus, and, rationalism, two, buildings, from, this, time, are, the, cre, ulescu, palace, housing, cultural, institutions, including, unesco, s, european, centre, for, higher, education, and, the, cotroceni, palace, the, residence, of, the, romanian, president, many, large, scale, constructions, such, as, the, gara, de, nord, the, busiest, railway, station, in, the, city, national, bank, of, romania, s, headquarters, and, the, telephones, company, building, date, from, these, times, in, the, 2000s, some, historic, buildings, in, the, city, centre, underwent, restoration, in, some, residential, areas, of, the, city, particularly, in, high, income, central, and, northern, districts, turn, of, the, 20th, century, villas, were, mostly, restored, beginning, in, the, late, 1990s, a, major, part, of, bucharest, s, architecture, is, made, up, of, buildings, constructed, during, the, communist, era, replacing, the, historical, architecture, with, high, density, apartment, blocks, significant, portions, of, the, historic, centre, of, bucharest, were, demolished, to, construct, one, of, the, largest, buildings, in, the, world, the, palace, of, the, parliament, then, officially, called, the, house, of, the, republic, in, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, project, of, systematization, new, buildings, were, built, in, previously, historical, areas, which, were, razed, and, then, built, upon, communist, architecture, broadly, includes, three, stages, architecture, that, was, built, in, the, early, years, of, communism, in, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, which, followed, the, soviet, stalinist, trend, of, socialist, realism, an, example, being, the, house, of, the, free, press, which, was, named, casa, sc, nteii, during, communism, postwar, modernism, in, the, 1960s, and, the, 1970s, and, the, systematization, program, of, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, which, included, mass, demolitions, of, historical, buildings, and, their, replacement, with, north, korean, influenced, buildings, after, nicolae, ceau, escu, visited, east, asia, in, 1971, and, was, impressed, by, its, juche, ideology, the, communist, regime, installed, after, world, war, ii, took, control, over, all, aspects, of, life, including, architecture, dictating, a, uniform, bureaucratic, vision, of, urbanism, and, architectural, design, gheorghe, gheorghiu, dej, who, was, premier, of, the, socialist, republic, of, romania, from, 1947, until, 1965, began, the, country, s, policies, of, industrialization, with, infrastructure, development, for, heavy, industry, and, construction, for, mass, resettlement, to, new, industrial, and, agricultural, centers, away, from, bucharest, and, other, principal, cities, the, architecture, from, this, period, is, more, or, less, easy, to, spot, by, its, use, of, neoclassical, elements, and, proportions, but, in, a, simplified, way, there, are, also, some, small, 3, 4, floors, russian, blocks, from, this, era, some, of, them, built, of, red, bricks, communist, era, architecture, from, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, can, be, found, especially, in, bucharest, s, residential, districts, mainly, in, blocuri, which, are, high, density, apartment, blocks, that, house, the, majority, of, the, city, s, population, initially, these, apartment, blocks, started, to, be, constructed, in, the, 1960s, on, relatively, empty, areas, and, fields, good, examples, include, pajura, drumul, taberei, berceni, and, titan, however, with, the, 1970s, they, mostly, targeted, peripheral, neighbourhoods, such, as, colentina, pantelimon, militari, and, rahova, construction, of, these, apartment, blocks, were, also, often, randomised, for, instance, some, small, streets, were, demolished, and, later, widened, with, the, blocks, being, built, next, to, them, but, other, neighbouring, streets, were, left, intact, like, in, the, example, of, calea, mo, ilor, from, 1978, to, 1982, or, built, in, various, patterns, such, as, the, pia, a, iancului, lizeanu, apartment, buildings, from, 1962, to, 1963, the, last, years, of, communism, were, marked, by, major, urban, redevelopment, schemes, which, changed, dramatically, the, face, of, many, cities, including, bucharest, one, of, the, most, singular, examples, of, late, stage, communist, architecture, of, the, 1980s, is, centrul, civic, a, development, that, replaced, a, major, part, of, bucharest, s, historic, city, centre, with, giant, utilitarian, buildings, mainly, with, marble, or, travertine, fa, ades, inspired, by, north, korean, architecture, the, mass, demolitions, that, occurred, in, the, 1980s, under, which, an, overall, area, of, eight, square, kilometres, of, the, historic, centre, of, bucharest, were, levelled, including, monasteries, churches, synagogues, a, hospital, and, a, noted, art, deco, sports, stadium, changed, drastically, the, appearance, of, the, city, since, the, fall, of, communism, in, 1989, several, communist, era, buildings, have, been, refurbished, modernised, and, used, for, other, purposes, perhaps, the, best, example, of, this, is, the, conversion, of, obsolete, retail, complexes, into, shopping, malls, and, commercial, centres, these, giant, circular, halls, which, were, unofficially, called, hunger, circuses, due, to, the, food, shortages, experienced, in, the, 1980s, were, constructed, during, the, ceau, escu, era, to, act, as, produce, markets, and, refectories, although, most, were, left, unfinished, at, the, time, of, the, revolution, modern, shopping, malls, such, as, the, unirea, shopping, centre, bucharest, mall, plaza, romania, and, city, mall, emerged, on, pre, existent, structures, of, former, hunger, circuses, another, example, is, the, conversion, of, a, large, utilitarian, construction, in, centrul, civic, into, a, marriott, hotel, this, process, was, accelerated, after, 2000, when, the, city, underwent, a, property, boom, and, many, communist, era, buildings, in, the, city, centre, became, prime, real, estate, due, to, their, location, many, communist, era, apartment, blocks, have, also, been, refurbished, to, improve, urban, appearance, the, newest, contribution, to, bucharest, s, architecture, took, place, after, the, fall, of, communism, particularly, after, 2000, when, the, city, went, through, a, period, of, urban, renewal, and, architectural, revitalization, on, the, back, of, romania, s, economic, growth, buildings, from, this, time, are, mostly, made, of, glass, and, steel, and, often, have, more, than, 10, stories, examples, include, shopping, malls, particularly, the, bucharest, mall, a, conversion, and, extension, of, an, abandoned, building, office, buildings, bank, headquarters, etc, during, the, 21st, century, several, high, rise, office, buildings, were, built, particularly, in, the, northern, and, eastern, parts, of, the, city, additionally, a, trend, to, add, modern, wings, and, fa, ades, to, historic, buildings, has, occurred, the, most, prominent, example, of, which, is, the, bucharest, architects, association, building, which, is, a, modern, glass, and, steel, construction, built, inside, a, historic, stone, fa, ade, in, 2013, the, bucharest, skyline, enriched, with, a, 137, m, high, office, building, skytower, of, floreasca, city, centre, the, tallest, building, in, romania, examples, of, modern, skyscrapers, built, in, the, 21st, century, include, bucharest, tower, centre, euro, tower, nusco, tower, cathedral, plaza, city, gate, towers, rin, grand, hotel, premium, plaza, bucharest, corporate, centre, millennium, business, centre, pgv, tower, charles, de, gaulle, plaza, business, development, centre, bucharest, brd, tower, and, bucharest, financial, plaza, despite, this, vertical, development, romanian, architects, avoid, designing, very, tall, buildings, due, to, vulnerability, to, earthquakes, aside, from, buildings, used, for, business, and, institutions, residential, developments, have, also, been, built, many, of, which, consist, of, high, rise, office, buildings, and, suburban, residential, communities, an, example, of, a, new, high, rise, residential, complex, is, asmita, gardens, these, developments, are, increasingly, prominent, in, northern, bucharest, which, is, less, densely, populated, and, is, home, to, middle, and, upper, class, bucharesters, due, to, the, process, of, gentrification, overall, 159, faculties, are, in, 34,
