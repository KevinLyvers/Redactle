closed, down, leaving, between, 40, 000, and, 50, 000, people, without, a, source, of, income, and, many, moved, into, informal, settlements, in, the, city, centre, the, ahmedabad, municipal, corporation, amc, the, governing, and, administrative, body, of, the, city, simultaneously, lost, much, of, its, tax, base, and, saw, an, increased, demand, for, services, in, the, 1990s, newly, emerging, pharmaceutical, chemical, and, automobile, manufacturing, industries, required, skilled, labor, so, many, migrants, seeking, work, ended, up, in, the, informal, sector, and, settled, in, slums, ahmedabad, has, made, efforts, to, reduce, poverty, and, improve, the, living, conditions, of, poor, residents, the, urban, poverty, rate, has, declined, from, 28, in, 1993, 1994, to, 10, in, 2011, 2012, this, is, partly, due, to, the, strengthening, of, the, amc, and, its, partnership, with, several, civil, society, organizations, csos, representing, poor, residents, through, projects, and, programs, the, amc, has, provided, utilities, and, basic, services, to, slums, however, some, challenges, remain, and, there, are, still, many, residents, who, lack, access, to, sanitation, clean, running, water, and, electricity, riots, often, rooted, in, religious, tensions, threaten, the, stability, of, neighborhoods, and, have, caused, spatial, segregation, across, religious, and, caste, lines, there, remains, to, be, seen, a, concerted, effort, to, balance, pro, poor, inclusive, development, with, national, initiatives, that, aim, to, create, global, cities, that, are, the, focus, of, capital, investment, and, technological, innovation, as, of, 2011, about, 66, of, the, population, lives, in, formal, housing, with, the, other, 34, living, in, slums, or, chawls, which, are, tenements, for, industrial, workers, there, are, approximately, 700, slum, settlements, in, ahmedabad, and, 11, of, the, total, housing, stock, is, public, housing, the, population, of, ahmedabad, has, increased, while, the, housing, stock, has, remained, generally, constant, and, this, has, led, to, a, rise, in, density, of, both, formal, and, informal, housing, and, a, more, economical, usage, of, existing, space, the, indian, census, estimates, that, the, ahmedabad, slum, population, was, 25, 6, of, the, total, population, in, 1991, and, had, decreased, to, 4, 5, in, 2011, but, these, numbers, are, contested, and, local, entities, maintain, that, the, census, underestimates, informal, populations, there, is, a, consensus, that, there, has, been, a, reduction, in, the, percentage, of, the, population, that, lives, in, slum, settlements, and, that, there, has, also, been, a, general, improvement, in, living, conditions, for, slum, residents, in, the, 1990s, the, amc, faced, increased, slum, populations, they, found, that, residents, were, willing, and, able, to, pay, for, legal, connections, to, water, sewage, and, electricity, but, because, of, tenure, issues, they, were, paying, higher, prices, for, low, quality, informal, connections, to, address, this, beginning, in, 1995, the, amc, partnered, with, civil, society, organizations, to, create, the, slum, networking, project, snp, to, improve, basic, services, in, 60, slums, benefitting, approximately, 13, 000, households, this, project, also, known, as, parivartan, change, involved, participatory, planning, in, which, slum, residents, were, partners, alongside, amc, private, institutions, microfinance, lenders, and, local, ngos, the, goal, of, the, program, was, to, provide, both, physical, infrastructure, including, water, supply, sewers, individual, toilets, paved, roads, storm, drainage, and, tree, planting, and, community, development, i, e, the, formation, of, resident, associations, women, s, groups, community, health, interventions, and, vocational, training, in, addition, participating, households, were, granted, a, minimum, de, facto, tenure, of, ten, years, the, project, cost, a, total, of, 4, 350, million, community, members, and, the, private, sector, each, contributed, 600, million, ngos, provided, 90, million, and, the, amc, paid, for, the, rest, of, the, project, each, slum, household, was, responsible, for, no, more, than, 12, of, the, cost, of, upgrading, their, home, this, project, has, generally, been, regarded, as, a, success, having, access, to, basic, services, increased, the, residents, working, hours, since, most, work, out, of, their, homes, it, also, reduced, the, incidence, of, illness, particularly, water, borne, illness, and, increased, children, s, rates, of, school, attendance, the, snp, received, the, 2006, unhabitat, dubai, international, award, for, best, practice, to, improve, the, living, environment, however, concerns, remain, about, the, community, s, responsibility, and, capacity, for, the, maintenance, of, the, new, infrastructure, additionally, trust, was, weakened, when, the, amc, demolished, two, of, slums, that, were, upgraded, as, part, of, snp, to, create, recreational, parks, according, to, the, 2011, census, hindus, are, the, predominant, religious, community, in, the, city,
