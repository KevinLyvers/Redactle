the, ring, of, fire, also, known, as, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, the, rim, of, fire, the, girdle, of, fire, or, the, circum, pacific, belt, is, a, tectonic, belt, of, volcanoes, and, earthquakes, it, is, about, 40, 000, km, 25, 000, mi, long, and, up, to, about, 500, km, 310, mi, wide, and, surrounds, most, of, the, pacific, ocean, the, ring, of, fire, contains, between, 750, and, 915, active, or, dormant, volcanoes, around, two, thirds, of, the, world, total, the, exact, number, of, volcanoes, within, the, ring, of, fire, depends, on, which, regions, are, included, about, 90, of, the, world, s, earthquakes, including, most, of, its, largest, occur, within, the, belt, the, ring, of, fire, is, not, a, single, geological, structure, it, was, created, by, the, subduction, of, different, tectonic, plates, at, convergent, boundaries, around, the, pacific, ocean, these, include, the, antarctic, nazca, and, cocos, plates, subducting, beneath, the, south, american, plate, the, pacific, and, juan, de, fuca, plates, beneath, the, north, american, plate, the, philippine, plate, beneath, the, eurasian, plate, and, a, complex, boundary, between, the, pacific, and, australian, plate, the, interactions, at, these, plate, boundaries, have, formed, oceanic, trenches, volcanic, arcs, back, arc, basins, and, volcanic, belts, the, inclusion, of, some, areas, in, the, ring, of, fire, such, as, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, western, indonesia, is, disputed, the, ring, of, fire, has, existed, for, more, than, 35, million, years, but, subduction, has, existed, for, much, longer, in, some, parts, of, the, ring, many, older, extinct, volcanoes, are, located, within, the, ring, more, than, 350, of, the, ring, of, fire, s, volcanoes, have, been, active, in, historical, times, while, the, four, largest, volcanic, eruptions, on, earth, in, the, holocene, epoch, all, occurred, at, volcanoes, in, the, ring, of, fire, most, of, earth, s, active, volcanoes, with, summits, above, sea, level, are, located, in, the, ring, of, fire, many, of, these, subaerial, volcanoes, are, stratovolcanoes, e, g, mount, st, helens, formed, by, explosive, eruptions, of, tephra, alternating, with, effusive, eruptions, of, lava, flows, lavas, at, the, ring, of, fire, s, stratovolcanoes, are, mainly, andesite, and, basaltic, andesite, but, dacite, rhyolite, basalt, and, some, other, rarer, types, also, occur, other, types, of, volcano, are, also, found, in, the, ring, of, fire, such, as, subaerial, shield, volcanoes, e, g, plosky, tolbachik, and, submarine, seamounts, e, g, monowai, from, ancient, greek, and, roman, times, until, the, late, 18th, century, volcanoes, were, associated, with, fire, based, on, the, ancient, belief, that, volcanoes, were, caused, by, fires, burning, within, the, earth, this, historical, link, between, volcanoes, and, fire, is, preserved, in, the, name, of, the, ring, of, fire, despite, the, fact, that, volcanoes, do, not, burn, the, earth, with, fire, the, existence, of, a, belt, of, volcanic, activity, around, the, pacific, ocean, was, known, in, the, early, 19th, century, for, example, in, 1825, the, pioneering, volcanologist, g, p, scrope, described, the, chains, of, volcanoes, around, the, pacific, ocean, s, rim, in, his, book, considerations, on, volcanos, three, decades, later, a, book, about, the, perry, expedition, to, japan, commented, on, the, ring, of, fire, volcanoes, as, follows, they, are, in, the, line, of, that, immense, circle, of, volcanic, development, which, surrounds, the, shores, of, the, pacific, from, tierra, del, fuego, around, to, the, moluccas, narrative, of, the, expedition, of, an, american, squadron, to, the, china, seas, and, japan, 1852, 54, an, article, appeared, in, scientific, american, in, 1878, with, the, title, the, ring, of, fire, and, the, volcanic, peaks, of, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, which, outlined, the, phenomenon, of, volcanic, activity, around, the, boundaries, of, the, pacific, early, explicit, references, to, volcanoes, forming, a, ring, of, fire, around, the, pacific, ocean, also, include, alexander, p, livingstone, s, book, complete, story, of, san, francisco, s, terrible, calamity, of, earthquake, and, fire, published, in, 1906, in, which, he, describes, the, great, ring, of, fire, which, circles, round, the, whole, surface, of, the, pacific, ocean, in, 1912, geologist, patrick, marshall, introduced, the, term, andesite, line, to, mark, a, boundary, between, islands, in, the, southwest, pacific, which, differ, in, volcano, structure, and, lava, types, the, concept, was, later, extended, to, other, parts, of, the, pacific, ocean, the, andesite, line, and, the, ring, of, fire, closely, match, in, terms, of, location, the, development, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, since, the, early, 1960s, has, provided, the, current, understanding, and, explanation, of, the, global, distribution, of, volcanoes, and, earthquakes, including, those, in, the, ring, of, fire, there, is, consensus, among, geologists, about, most, of, the, regions, which, are, included, in, the, ring, of, fire, there, are, however, a, few, regions, on, which, there, is, no, universal, agreement, see, distribution, of, volcanoes, indonesia, lies, at, the, intersection, of, the, ring, of, fire, and, the, alpide, belt, which, is, the, earth, s, other, very, long, subduction, related, volcanic, and, earthquake, zone, also, known, as, the, mediterranean, indonesian, volcanic, belt, running, east, west, through, southern, asia, and, southern, europe, some, geologists, include, all, of, indonesia, in, the, ring, of, fire, many, geologists, exclude, indonesia, s, western, islands, which, they, include, in, the, alpide, belt, some, geologists, include, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, the, south, shetland, islands, in, the, ring, of, fire, other, geologists, exclude, these, areas, the, rest, of, antarctica, is, excluded, because, the, volcanism, there, is, not, related, to, subduction, the, ring, of, fire, does, not, extend, across, the, southern, pacific, ocean, from, new, zealand, to, the, antarctic, peninsula, or, from, new, zealand, to, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, because, the, submarine, plate, boundaries, in, this, part, of, the, pacific, ocean, the, pacific, antarctic, ridge, the, east, pacific, rise, and, the, chile, ridge, are, divergent, instead, of, convergent, although, some, volcanism, occurs, in, this, region, it, is, not, related, to, subduction, some, geologists, include, the, izu, islands, the, bonin, islands, and, the, mariana, islands, other, geologists, exclude, them, volcanoes, in, the, central, parts, of, the, pacific, basin, for, example, the, hawaiian, islands, are, very, far, from, subduction, zones, and, they, are, not, part, of, the, ring, of, fire, the, ring, of, fire, has, existed, for, more, than, 35, million, years, in, some, parts, of, the, ring, of, fire, subduction, has, been, occurring, for, much, longer, the, current, configuration, of, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, has, been, created, by, the, development, of, the, present, day, subduction, zones, initially, by, about, 115, million, years, ago, in, south, america, north, america, and, asia, as, plate, configurations, gradually, changed, the, current, subduction, zones, of, indonesia, and, new, guinea, were, created, about, 70, million, years, ago, followed, finally, by, the, new, zealand, subduction, zone, about, 35, million, years, ago, along, the, coast, of, east, asia, during, the, late, triassic, about, 210, million, years, ago, subduction, of, the, izanagi, plate, the, paleo, pacific, plate, was, occurring, and, this, continued, in, the, jurassic, producing, volcanic, belts, for, example, in, what, is, now, eastern, china, the, pacific, plate, came, into, existence, in, the, early, jurassic, about, 190, million, years, ago, far, from, the, margins, of, the, then, paleo, pacific, ocean, until, the, pacific, plate, grew, large, enough, to, reach, the, margins, of, the, ocean, basin, other, older, plates, were, subducted, ahead, of, it, at, the, ocean, basin, margins, for, example, subduction, has, been, occurring, at, the, coast, of, south, america, since, the, jurassic, period, more, than, 145, million, years, ago, and, remnants, of, jurassic, and, cretaceous, volcanic, arcs, are, preserved, there, at, about, 120, to, 115, million, years, ago, the, farallon, plate, was, subducting, under, south, america, north, america, and, north, east, asia, while, the, izanagi, plate, was, subducting, under, east, asia, by, 85, to, 70, million, years, ago, the, izanagi, plate, had, moved, north, eastwards, and, was, subducting, under, east, asia, and, north, america, while, the, farallon, plate, was, subducting, under, south, america, and, the, pacific, plate, was, subducting, under, east, asia, about, 70, to, 65, million, years, ago, the, farallon, plate, was, subducting, under, south, america, the, kula, plate, was, subducting, under, north, america, and, north, east, asia, and, the, pacific, plate, was, subducting, under, east, asia, and, papua, new, guinea, about, 35, million, years, ago, the, kula, and, farallon, plates, had, been, subducted, and, the, pacific, plate, was, subducting, around, its, rim, in, a, configuration, closely, resembling, the, outline, of, the, present, day, ring, of, fire, the, eastern, parts, of, the, ring, of, fire, result, from, the, collision, of, a, few, relatively, large, plates, the, western, parts, of, the, ring, are, more, complex, with, a, number, of, large, and, small, tectonic, plates, in, collision, in, south, america, the, ring, of, fire, is, the, result, of, the, antarctic, plate, the, nazca, plate, and, the, cocos, plate, being, subducted, beneath, the, south, american, plate, in, central, america, the, cocos, plate, is, being, subducted, beneath, the, caribbean, plate, a, portion, of, the, pacific, plate, and, the, small, juan, de, fuca, plate, are, being, subducted, beneath, the, north, american, plate, along, the, northern, portion, the, northwestward, moving, pacific, plate, is, being, subducted, beneath, the, aleutian, islands, arc, farther, west, the, pacific, plate, is, being, subducted, at, the, kamchatka, peninsula, and, kuril, arcs, farther, south, at, japan, taiwan, and, the, philippines, the, philippine, plate, is, being, subducted, beneath, the, eurasian, plate, the, southwest, section, of, the, ring, of, fire, is, more, complex, with, a, number, of, smaller, tectonic, plates, in, collision, with, the, pacific, plate, at, the, mariana, islands, the, philippines, eastern, indonesia, papua, new, guinea, tonga, and, new, zealand, this, part, of, the, ring, excludes, australia, because, that, landmass, lies, in, the, center, of, its, tectonic, plate, far, from, subduction, zones, if, a, tectonic, plate, s, oceanic, lithosphere, is, subducted, beneath, oceanic, lithosphere, of, another, plate, a, volcanic, island, arc, is, created, at, the, subduction, zone, an, example, in, the, ring, of, fire, is, the, mariana, arc, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, if, however, oceanic, lithosphere, is, subducted, under, continental, lithosphere, then, a, volcanic, continental, arc, forms, a, ring, of, fire, example, is, the, coast, of, chile, the, steepness, of, the, descending, plate, at, a, subduction, zone, depends, on, the, age, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, that, is, being, subducted, the, older, the, oceanic, lithosphere, being, subducted, the, steeper, the, angle, of, descent, of, the, subducted, slab, as, the, pacific, s, mid, ocean, ridges, which, are, the, source, of, its, oceanic, lithosphere, are, not, actually, in, the, middle, of, the, ocean, but, located, much, closer, to, south, america, than, to, asia, the, oceanic, lithosphere, consumed, at, the, south, american, subduction, zones, is, younger, and, therefore, subduction, occurs, at, the, south, american, coast, at, a, relatively, shallow, angle, older, oceanic, lithosphere, is, subducted, in, the, western, pacific, with, steeper, angles, of, slab, descent, this, variation, affects, for, example, the, location, of, volcanoes, relative, to, the, ocean, trench, lava, composition, type, and, severity, of, earthquakes, sediment, accretion, and, the, amount, of, compression, or, tension, a, spectrum, of, subduction, zones, exists, between, the, chilean, and, mariana, end, members, oceanic, trenches, are, the, topographic, expression, of, subduction, zones, on, the, floor, of, the, oceans, oceanic, trenches, associated, with, the, ring, of, fire, s, subduction, zones, are, subduction, zones, around, the, pacific, ocean, do, not, form, a, complete, ring, where, subduction, zones, are, absent, there, are, corresponding, gaps, in, subduction, related, volcanic, belts, in, the, ring, of, fire, in, some, gaps, there, is, no, volcanic, activity, in, other, gaps, volcanic, activity, does, occur, but, it, is, caused, by, processes, not, related, to, subduction, there, are, gaps, in, the, ring, of, fire, at, some, parts, of, the, pacific, coast, of, the, americas, in, some, places, the, gaps, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, flat, slab, subduction, examples, are, the, three, gaps, between, the, four, sections, of, the, andean, volcanic, belt, in, south, america, in, north, america, there, is, a, gap, in, subduction, related, volcanic, activity, in, northern, mexico, and, southern, california, due, partly, to, a, divergent, boundary, in, the, gulf, of, california, and, due, partly, to, the, san, andreas, fault, a, non, volcanic, transform, boundary, another, north, american, gap, in, subduction, related, volcanic, activity, occurs, in, northern, british, columbia, yukon, and, south, east, alaska, where, volcanism, is, caused, by, intraplate, continental, rifting, the, four, largest, volcanic, eruptions, on, earth, in, the, holocene, epoch, the, last, 11, 700, years, occurred, at, volcanoes, in, the, ring, of, fire, they, are, the, eruptions, at, fisher, caldera, alaska, 8700, bc, kuril, lake, kamchatka, 6450, bc, kikai, caldera, japan, 5480, bc, and, mount, mazama, oregon, 5677, bc, more, broadly, twenty, of, the, twenty, five, largest, volcanic, eruptions, on, earth, in, this, time, interval, occurred, at, ring, of, fire, volcanoes, about, 90, of, the, world, s, earthquakes, and, most, of, the, world, s, largest, earthquakes, occur, along, the, ring, of, fire, the, next, most, seismically, active, region, 5, 6, of, earthquakes, and, some, of, the, world, s, largest, earthquakes, is, the, alpide, belt, which, extends, from, central, indonesia, to, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, via, the, himalayas, and, southern, europe, from, 1900, to, the, end, of, 2020, most, earthquakes, of, magnitude, m, w, 8, 0, occurred, in, the, ring, of, fire, they, are, presumed, to, have, been, megathrust, earthquakes, at, subduction, zones, including, four, of, the, most, powerful, earthquakes, on, earth, since, modern, seismological, measuring, equipment, and, magnitude, measurement, scales, were, introduced, in, the, 1930s, some, geologists, include, the, volcanoes, of, the, south, shetland, islands, off, the, northern, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, as, part, of, the, ring, of, fire, these, volcanoes, e, g, deception, island, are, due, to, rifting, in, the, bransfield, back, arc, basin, close, to, the, south, shetland, subduction, zone, the, antarctic, peninsula, graham, land, is, also, sometimes, included, in, the, ring, volcanoes, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, e, g, the, volcanoes, of, victoria, land, including, mount, erebus, and, the, volcanoes, of, mary, byrd, land, are, not, related, to, subduction, therefore, they, are, not, part, of, the, ring, of, fire, the, balleny, islands, located, between, antarctica, and, new, zealand, are, volcanic, but, their, volcanism, is, not, related, to, subduction, therefore, they, are, not, part, of, the, ring, of, fire, the, world, s, highest, active, volcano, is, ojos, del, salado, 6, 893, m, or, 22, 615, ft, which, is, in, the, andes, mountains, section, of, the, ring, of, fire, it, forms, part, of, the, border, between, argentina, and, chile, and, it, last, erupted, in, ad, 750, another, ring, of, fire, andean, volcano, on, the, argentina, chile, border, is, llullaillaco, 6, 739, m, or, 22, 110, ft, which, is, the, world, s, highest, historically, active, volcano, last, erupting, in, 1877, chile, has, experienced, numerous, volcanic, eruptions, from, about, 90, volcanoes, during, the, holocene, epoch, villarrica, is, one, of, chile, s, most, active, volcanoes, rising, above, the, lake, and, town, of, the, same, name, it, is, the, westernmost, of, three, large, stratovolcanoes, that, trend, perpendicular, to, the, andes, along, the, gastre, fault, villarrica, along, with, quetrupill, n, and, the, chilean, part, of, lan, n, are, protected, within, villarrica, national, park, villarrica, with, its, lava, of, basaltic, andesitic, composition, is, one, of, only, five, volcanoes, worldwide, known, to, have, an, active, lava, lake, within, its, crater, the, volcano, usually, generates, strombolian, eruptions, with, ejection, of, incandescent, pyroclasts, and, lava, flows, melting, of, snow, and, glacier, ice, as, well, as, rainfall, often, causes, lahars, such, as, during, the, eruptions, of, 1964, and, 1971, a, two, kilometre, wide, 1, 1, 4, mi, postglacial, caldera,

conguill, o, national, park, llaima, s, activity, has, been, documented, since, the, 17th, century, and, consists, of, several, separate, episodes, of, moderate, explosive, eruptions, with, occasional, lava, flows, lascar, is, a, stratovolcano, and, the, most, active, volcano, of, the, northern, chilean, andes, the, largest, eruption, of, lascar, took, place, about, 26, 500, years, ago, and, following, the, eruption, of, the, tumbres, scoria, flow, about, 9, 000, years, ago, activity, shifted, back, to, the, eastern, edifice, where, three, overlapping, craters, were, formed, frequent, small, to, moderate, explosive, eruptions, have, been, recorded, from, lascar, in, historical, time, since, the, mid, 19th, century, along, with, periodic, larger, eruptions, that, produced, ash, and, tephra, fall, up, to, hundreds, of, kilometers, away, from, the, volcano, the, largest, eruption, of, lascar, in, recent, history, took, place, in, 1993, producing, pyroclastic, flows, as,

in, the, western, united, states, this, arc, includes, nearly, 20, major, volcanoes, among, a, total, of, over, 4, 000, separate, volcanic, vents, including, numerous, stratovolcanoes, shield, volcanoes, lava, domes, and, cinder, cones, along, with, a, few, isolated, examples, of, rarer, volcanic, forms, such, as, tuyas, volcanism, in, the, arc, began, about, 37, million, years, ago, but, most, of, the, present, day, cascade, volcanoes, are, less, than, 2, million, years, old, and, the, highest, peaks, are, less, than, 100, 000, years, old, the, arc, is, formed, by, the, subduction, of, the, gorda, and, juan, de, fuca, plates, at, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, this, is, a, 1, 090, kilometre, long, 680, mi, fault, running, 80, km, 50, mi, off, the, coast, of, the, pacific, northwest, from, northern, california, to, vancouver, island, british, columbia, the, plates, move, at, a, relative, rate, of, over, 10, mm, 0, 4, in, per, year, at, an, oblique, angle, to, the, subduction, zone, because, of, the, very, large, fault, area, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, can, produce, very, large, earthquakes, magnitude, 9, 0, or, greater, if, rupture, occurred, over, its, whole, area, when, the, locked, zone, stores, energy, for, an, earthquake, the, transition, zone, although, somewhat, plastic, can, rupture, thermal, and, deformation, studies, indicate, that, the,

compressed, similar, to, a, giant, spring, when, the, stored, energy, is, suddenly, released, by, slippage, across, the, fault, at, irregular, intervals, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, can, create, very, large, earthquakes, such, as, the, magnitude, 9, cascadia, earthquake, of, 1700, geological, evidence, indicates, that, great, earthquakes, may, have, occurred, at, least, seven, times, in, the, last, 3, 500, years, suggesting, a, return, time, of, 400, to, 600, years, also, evidence, of, accompanying, tsunamis, with, every, earthquake, is, seen, as, the, prime, reason, these, earthquakes, are, known, is, through, scars, the, tsunamis, left, on, the, coast, and, through, japanese, records, tsunami, waves, can, travel, across, the, pacific, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens,

volcanoes, which, have, erupted, since, about, 1760, volcanoes, are, found, not, only, in, the, mainland, but, also, in, the, aleutian, islands, the, united, states, geological, survey, and, the, national, earthquake, information, center, monitor, volcanoes, and, earthquakes, in, the, united, states, british, columbia, and, yukon, are, home, to, a, region, of, volcanoes, and, volcanic, activity, in, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, more, than, 20, volcanoes, have, erupted, in, the, western, canada, during, the, holocene, epoch, but, only, 6, are, directly, related, to, subduction, bridge, river, cones, mount, cayley, mount, garibaldi, garibaldi, lake, silverthrone, caldera, and, mount, meager, massif, several, mountains, in, populated, areas, of, british, columbia, are, dormant, volcanoes, most, of, these, were, active, during, the, pleistocene, and, holocene, epochs, although, none, of, canada, s, volcanoes, are, currently, erupting, several, volcanoes, volcanic, fields, and, volcanic, centers, are, considered, potentially, active, there, are, hot, springs, at, some, volcanoes, since, 1975, seismic, activity, appears, to, have, been, associated, with, some, volcanoes, in, british, columbia, including, the, six, subduction, related, volcanoes, as, well, as, intraplate, volcanoes, such, as, wells, gray, clearwater, volcanic, field, the, volcanoes, are, grouped, into, five, volcanic, belts, with, different, tectonic, settings, the, northern, cordilleran, volcanic, province, is, an, area, of, numerous, volcanoes, which, are, caused, by, continental, rifting, not, subduction, therefore, geologists, often, regard, it, as, a, gap, in, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, between, the, cascade, volcanic, arc, further, south, and, alaska, s, aleutian, arc, further, north, the, garibaldi, volcanic, belt, in, southwestern, british, columbia, is, the, northern, extension, of, the, cascade, volcanic, arc, in, the, united, states, which, includes, mount, baker, and, mount, st, helens, and, contains, the, most, explosive, young, volcanoes, in, canada, it, formed, as, a, result, of, subduction, of, the, juan, de, fuca, plate, a, remnant, of, the, much, larger, farallon, plate, under, the, north, american, plate, along, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, the, garibaldi, volcanic, belt, includes, the, bridge, river, cones, mount, cayley, mount, fee, mount, garibaldi, mount, price, mount, meager, massif, the, squamish, volcanic, field, and, more, smaller, volcanoes, the, eruption, styles, in, the, belt, range, from, effusive, to, explosive, with, compositions, from, basalt, to, rhyolite, morphologically, centers, include, calderas, cinder, cones, stratovolcanoes, and, small, isolated, lava, masses, due, to, repeated, continental, and, alpine, glaciations, many, of, the, volcanic, deposits, in, the, belt, reflect, complex, interactions, between, magma, composition, topography, and, changing, ice, configurations, the, most, recent, major, catastrophic, eruption, in, the, garibaldi, volcanic, belt, was, an, explosive, eruption, of, the, mount, meager, massif, about, 2, 350, years, ago, it, was, similar, to, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, sending, an, ash, column, about, 20, km, into, the, stratosphere, the, chilcotin, group, is, a, north, south, range, of, volcanoes, in, southern, british, columbia, running, parallel, to, the, garibaldi, volcanic, belt, the, majority, of, the, eruptions, in, this, belt, happened, either, 6, 10, million, years, ago, miocene, or, 2, 3, million, years, ago, pliocene, although, with, some, slightly, more, recent, eruptions, in, the, pleistocene, it, is, thought, to, have, formed, as, a, result, of, back, arc, extension, behind, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, volcanoes, in, this, belt, include, mount, noel, the, clisbako, caldera, complex, lightning, peak, black, dome, mountain, and, many, lava, flows, eruptions, of, basaltic, to, rhyolitic, volcanoes, and, hypabyssal, rocks, of, the, alert, bay, volcanic, belt, in, northern, vancouver, island, are, probably, linked, with, the, subducted, margin, flanked, by, the, explorer, and, juan, de, fuca, plates, at, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, it, appears, to, have, been, active, during, the, pliocene, and, pleistocene, however, no, holocene, eruptions, are, known, and, volcanic, activity, in, the, belt, has, likely, ceased, the, active, queen, charlotte, fault, on, the, west, coast, of, the, haida, gwaii, british, columbia, has, generated, three, large, earthquakes, during, the, 20th, century, a, magnitude, 7, event, in, 1929, a, magnitude, 8, 1, in, 1949, canada, s, largest, recorded, earthquake, and, a, magnitude, 7, 4, in, 1970, the, public, safety, geo, science, program, at,
