overseeing, belarus, transformation, from, an, agrarian, to, industrial, economy, the, parliament, of, the, republic, proclaimed, the, sovereignty, of, belarus, on, 27, july, 1990, and, during, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, belarus, gained, independence, on, 25, august, 1991, following, the, adoption, of, a, new, constitution, in, 1994, alexander, lukashenko, was, elected, belarus, s,

baku, initiative, the, name, belarus, is, closely, related, with, the, term, belaya, rus, i, e, white, rus, there, are, several, claims, to, the, origin, of, the, name, white, rus, an, ethno, religious, theory, suggests, that, the, name, used, to, describe, the, part, of, old, ruthenian, lands, within, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, that, had, been, populated, mostly, by, slavs, who, had, been, christianized, early, as, opposed, to, black, ruthenia, which, was, predominantly, inhabited, by, pagan, balts, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, name, comments, on, the, white, clothing, worn, by, the, local, slavic, population, a, third, theory, suggests, that, the, old, rus, lands, that, were, not, conquered, by, the, tatars, i, e, polotsk, vitebsk, and, mogilev, had, been, referred, to, as, white, rus, a, fourth, theory, suggests, that, the, color, white, was, associated, with, the, west, and, belarus, was, the, western, part, of, rus, in, the, 9th, to, 13th, centuries, the, name, rus, is, often, conflated, with, its, latin, forms, russia, and, ruthenia, thus, belarus, is, often, referred, to, as, white, russia, or, white, ruthenia, the, name, first, appeared, in, german, and, latin, medieval, literature, the, chronicles, of, jan, of, czarnk, w, mention, the, imprisonment, of, lithuanian, grand, duke, jogaila, and, his, mother, at, albae, russiae, poloczk, dicto, in, 1381, the, first, known, use, of, white, russia, to, refer, to, belarus, was, in, the, late, 16th, century, by, englishman, sir, jerome, horsey, who, was, known, for, his, close, contacts, with, the, russian, royal, court, during, the, 17th, century, the, russian, tsars, used, the, term, to, describe, the, lands, added, from, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, the, term, belorussia, russian, the, latter, part, similar, but, spelled, and, stressed, differently, from, russia, first, rose, in, the, days, of, the, russian, empire, and, the, russian, tsar, was, usually, styled, the, tsar, of, all, the, russias, as, russia, or, the, russian, empire, was, formed, by, three, parts, of, russia, the, great, little, and, white, this, asserted, that, the, territories, are, all, russian, and, all, the, peoples, are, also, russian, in, the, case, of, the, belarusians, they, were, variants, of, the, russian, people, after, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, 1917, the, term, white, russia, caused, some, confusion, as, it, was, also, the, name, of, the, military, force, that, opposed, the, red, bolsheviks, during, the, period, of, the, byelorussian, ssr, the, term, byelorussia, was, embraced, as, part, of, a, national, consciousness, in, western, belarus, under, polish, control, byelorussia, became, commonly, used, in, the, regions, of, bia, ystok, and, grodno, during, the, interwar, period, the, term, byelorussia, its, names, in, other, languages, such, as, english, being, based, on, the, russian, form, was, used, officially, only, until, 1991, officially, the, full, name, of, the, country, is, republic, of, belarus, respublika, belarus, in, russia, the, usage, of, belorussia, is, still, very, common, in, lithuanian, besides, baltarusija, white, russia, belarus, is, also, called, gudija, the, etymology, of, the, word, gudija, is, not, clear, by, one, hypothesis, the, word, derives, from, the, old, prussian, name, gudwa, which, in, turn, is, related, to, the, form, udwa, which, is, a, distorted, version, of, sudwa, sudovia, sudovia, in, its, turn, is, one, of, the, names, of, the, yotvingians, another, hypothesis, connects, the, word, with, the, gothic, kingdom, that, occupied, parts, of, the, territory, of, modern, belarus, and, ukraine, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, the, self, naming, of, goths, was, gutans, and, gytos, which, are, close, to, gudija, yet, another, hypothesis, is, based, on, the, idea, that, gudija, in, lithuanian, means, the, other, and, may, have, been, used, historically, by, lithuanians, to, refer, to, any, people, who, did, not, speak, lithuanian, from, 5000, to, 2000, bc, the, bandkeramik, predominated, in, what, now, constitutes, belarus, and, the, cimmerians, as, well, as, other, pastoralists,

culture, were, found, in, belarus, and, parts, of, ukraine, the, region, was, first, permanently, settled, by, baltic, tribes, in, the, 3rd, century, around, the, 5th, century, the, area, was, taken, over, by, the, slavs, the, takeover, was, partially, due, to, the, lack, of, military, coordination, of, the, balts, but, their, gradual, assimilation, into, slavic, culture, was, peaceful, in, nature, invaders, from, asia, among, whom, were, the, huns, and, avars, swept, through, c, 400, 600, ad, but, were, unable, to, dislodge, the, slavic, presence, in, the, 9th, century, the, territory, of, modern, belarus, became, part, of, kievan, rus, a, vast, east, slavic, state, ruled, by, the, rurikids, upon, the, death, of, its, ruler, yaroslav, the, wise, in, 1054, the, state, split, into, independent, principalities, the, battle, on, the, nemiga, river, in, 1067, was, one, of, the, more, notable, events, of, the, period, the, date, of, which, is, considered, the, founding, date, of, minsk, many, early, principalities, were, virtually, razed, or, severely, affected, by, a, major, mongol, invasion, in, the, 13th, century, but, the, lands, of, modern, day, belarus, avoided, the, brunt, of, the, invasion, and, eventually, joined, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, there, are, no, sources, of, military, seizure, but, the, annals, affirm, the, alliance, and, united, foreign, policy, of, polotsk, and, lithuania, for, decades, trying, to, avoid, the, tatar, yoke, the, principality, of, minsk, sought, protection, from, lithuanian, princes, further, north, and, in, 1242, the, principality, of, minsk, became, a, part, of, the, expanding, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, incorporation, into, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, resulted, in, an, economic, political, and, ethno, cultural, unification, of, belarusian, lands, of, the, principalities, held, by, the, duchy, nine, of, them, were, settled, by, a, population, that, would, eventually, become, the, belarusians, during, this, time, the, duchy, was, involved, in, several, military, campaigns, including, fighting, on, the, side, of, poland, against, the, teutonic, knights, at, the, battle, of, grunwald, in,

potential, threat, from, muscovy, to, strengthen, their, independence, within, the, format, of, the, union, three, editions, of, the, statutes, of, lithuania, were, issued, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, third, article, of, the, statutes, established, that, all, lands, of, the, duchy, will, be, eternally, within, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, never, enter, as, a, part, of, other, states, the, statutes, allowed, the, right, to, own, land, only, to, noble, families, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, anyone, from, outside, the, duchy, gaining, rights, to, a, property, would, actually, own, it, only, after, swearing, allegiance, to, the, grand, duke, of, lithuania, a, title, dually, held, by, the, king, of, poland, these, articles, were, aimed, to, defend, the, rights, of, the, lithuanian, nobility, within, the, duchy, against, polish, and, other, nobles, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, the, years, following, the, union, the, process, of,
