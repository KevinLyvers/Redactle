siberia, s, a, b, r, i, sy, beer, ee, russian, romanized, sibir, ipa, is, an, extensive, geographical, region, comprising, all, of, north, asia, from, the, ural, mountains, in, the, west, to, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, east, it, has, formed, a, part, of, the, sovereign, territory, of, russia, and, its, predecessor, states, since, the, centuries, long, conquest, of, siberia, which, began, with, the, fall, of, the, khanate, of, sibir, in, the, late, 16th, century, and, concluded, with, the, annexation, of, chukotka, in, 1778, siberia, is, vast, and, sparsely, populated, covering, an, area, of, over, 13, 1, million, square, kilometres, 5, 100, 000, sq, mi, but, home, to, roughly, a, quarter, of, russia, s, population, novosibirsk, krasnoyarsk, and, omsk, are, the, largest, cities, in, the, area, because, siberia, is, a, geographic, and, historic, concept, and, not, a, political, entity, there, is, no, single, precise, definition, of, its, territorial, borders, traditionally, siberia, spans, the, entire, expanse, of, land, from, the, ural, mountains, to, the, pacific, ocean, with, the, ural, river, usually, forming, the, southernmost, portion, of, its, western, boundary, and, includes, most, of, the, drainage, basin, of, the, arctic, ocean, it, is, further, defined, as, stretching, from, the, territories, within, the, arctic, circle, in, the, north, to, the, northern, borders, of, kazakhstan, mongolia, and, china, in, the, south, although, the, hills, of, north, central, kazakhstan, are, also, commonly, included, the, russian, government, divides, the, region, into, three, federal, districts, groupings, of, russian, federal, subjects, of, which, only, the, central, one, is, officially, referred, to, as, siberian, the, other, two, are, the, ural, and, far, eastern, federal, districts, named, for, the, ural, and, russian, far, east, regions, that, correspond, respectively, to, the, western, and, eastern, thirds, of, siberia, in, the, broader, sense, siberia, is, known, for, its, long, harsh, winters, with, a, january, average, of, 25, c, 13, f, although, it, is, geographically, in, asia, russian, sovereignty, and, colonization, since, the, 16th, century, have, rendered, the, region, culturally, and, ethnically, european, over, 85, of, its, population, are, of, european, descent, chiefly, russian, comprising, the, siberian, sub, ethnic, group, and, eastern, slavic, cultural, influences, predominate, throughout, the, region, nevertheless, there, exist, sizable, ethnic, minorities, of, asian, lineage, including, various, turkic, communities, many, of, which, such, as, the, yakuts, tuvans, altai, and, khakas, are, indigenous, along, with, the, mongolic, buryats, ethnic, koreans, and, smaller, groups, of, samoyedic, and, tungusic, peoples, several, of, whom, are, classified, as, indigenous, small, numbered, peoples, by, the, russian, government, among, many, others, the, origin, of, the, name, is, uncertain, the, russian, name, yugra, was, applied, to, the, northern, lands, east, of, the, urals, which, had, been, known, of, since, the, 11th, century, or, earlier, while, the, name, siberia, is, first, mentioned, in, russian, chronicles, at, the, start, of, the, 15th, century, in, connection, with, the, death, of, the, khan, tokhtamysh, in, the, siberian, land, some, sources, say, that, siberia, originates, from, the, siberian, tatar, word, for, sleeping, land, sib, ir, a, further, variant, claims, that, the, region, was, named, after, the, sibe, people, the, polish, historian, chyliczkowski, has, proposed, that, the, name, derives, from, the, proto, slavic, word, for, north, sever, same, as, severia, anatole, baikaloff, has, dismissed, this, explanation, he, said, that, the, neighboring, chinese, turks, and, mongolians, who, have, similar, names, for, the, region, would, not, have, known, russian, he, suggested, that, the, name, might, be, a, combination, of, two, words, with, turkic, origin, su, water, and, bir, wild, land, another, account, sees, the, name, as, the, ancient, tribal, ethnonym, of, the, sirtya, also, syopyr, s, p, r, a, hypothetical, paleo, asiatic, ethnic, group, assimilated, by, the, nenets, mongolist, gy, rgy, kara, posits, that, siberia, is, derived, from, a, mongolic, word, sibir, cognate, with, modern, buryat, sheber, or, dense, forest, siberia, in, paleozoic, times, formed, the, continent, of, siberia, angaraland, which, fused, to, euramerica, during, the, late, carboniferous, as, part, of, the, formation, of, pangea, the, siberian, traps, were, formed, by, one, of, the, largest, known, volcanic, events, of, the, last, 251, million, years, of, earth, s, geological, history, their, activity, continued, for, a, million, years, and, some, scientists, consider, it, a, possible, cause, of, the, great, dying, about, 250, million, years, ago, estimated, to, have, killed, 90, of, species, existing, at, the, time, the, region, has, paleontological, significance, as, it, contains, bodies, of, prehistoric, animals, from, the, pleistocene, epoch, preserved, in, ice, or, permafrost, specimens, of, goldfuss, cave, lion, cubs, yuka, the, mammoth, and, another, woolly, mammoth, from, oymyakon, a, woolly, rhinoceros, from, the, kolyma, and, bison, and, horses, from, yukagir, have, been, found, remote, wrangel, island, and, the, taymyr, peninsula, are, believed, to, have, been, the, last, places, on, earth, to, support, woolly, mammoths, as, isolated, populations, until, their, extinction, around, 2000, bc, at, least, three, species, of, humans, lived, in, southern, siberia, around, 40, 000, years, ago, h, sapiens, h, neanderthalensis, and, the, denisovans, in, 2010, dna, evidence, identified, the, last, as, a, separate, species, late, paleolithic, southern, siberians, appear, to, be, related, to, paleolithic, europeans, and, the, paleolithic, j, mon, people, of, japan, ancient, dna, analysis, has, revealed, that, the, oldest, fossil, known, to, carry, the, derived, kitlg, allele, which, is, responsible, for, blond, hair, in, modern, europeans, is, a, 17, 000, year, old, ancient, north, eurasian, specimen, from, siberia, ancient, north, eurasian, populations, genetically, similar, to, mal, ta, buret, culture, and, afontova, gora, were, an, important, genetic, contributor, to, native, americans, europeans, ancient, central, asians, south, asians, and, some, east, asian, groups, such, as, the, ainu, people, evidence, from, full, genomic, studies, suggests, that, the, first, people, in, the, americas, diverged, from, ancient, east, asians, about, 36, 000, years, ago, and, expanded, northwards, into, siberia, where, they, encountered, and, interacted, with, ancient, north, eurasians, giving, rise, to, both, paleosiberian, peoples, and, ancient, native, americans, which, later, migrated, towards, the, beringian, region, became, isolated, from, other, populations, and, subsequently, populated, the, americas, during, past, millennia, different, groups, of, nomads, such, as, the, enets, the, nenets, the, huns, the, xiongnu, the, scythians, and, the, yugur, inhabited, various, parts, of, siberia, the, afanasievo, and, tashtyk, cultures, of, the, yenisey, valley, and, altay, mountains, are, associated, with, the, indo, european, migrations, across, eurasia, the, proto, mongol, khitan, people, also, occupied, parts, of, the, region, in, the, 13th, century, during, the, period, of, the, mongol, empire, the, mongols, conquered, a, large, part, of, this, area, with, the, breakup, of, the, golden, horde, the, autonomous, khanate, of, sibir, was, formed, in, the, late, 15th, century, turkic, speaking, yakut, migrated, north, from, the, lake, baikal, region, under, pressure, from, the, mongol, tribes, from, the, 13th, to, 15th, centuries, siberia, remained, a, sparsely, populated, area, historian, john, f, richards, wrote, it, is, doubtful, that, the, total, early, modern, siberian, population, exceeded, 300, 000, persons, the, first, mention, of, siberia, in, chronicles, is, recorded, in, the, year, 1032, the, city, state, of, novgorod, established, two, trade, routes, to, the, ob, river, and, laid, claim, to, the, lands, the, russians, called, yugra, the, russians, were, attracted, by, its, furs, in, particular, novgorod, launched, military, campaigns, to, extract, tribute, from, the, local, population, but, often, met, resistance, such, as, two, campaigns, in, 1187, and, 1193, mentioned, in, chronicles, that, were, defeated, after, novgorod, was, annexed, by, moscow, the, newly, emerging, centralized, russian, state, also, laid, claim, to, the, region, with, ivan, iii, of, russia, sending, expeditionary, forces, to, siberia, in, 1483, and, 1499, 1500, the, russians, received, tribute, but, contact, with, the, tribes, ceased, after, they, left, the, growing, power, of, russia, began, to, undermine, the, siberian, khanate, in, the, 16th, century, first, groups, of, traders, and, cossacks, began, to, enter, the, area, the, russian, army, was, directed, to, establish, forts, farther, and, farther, east, to, protect, new, russian, settlers, who, migrated, from, europe, towns, such, as, mangazeya, tara, yeniseysk, and, tobolsk, developed, the, last, becoming, the, de, facto, capital, of, siberia, from, 1590, at, this, time, sibir, was, the,

along, a, left, tributary, of, the, ob, other, sources, contend, that, the, sibe, an, indigenous, tungusic, people, offered, fierce, resistance, to, russian, expansion, beyond, the, urals, some, suggest, that, the, term, siberia, is, a, russification, of, their, ethnonym, by, the, mid, 17th, century, russia, had, established, areas, of, control, that, extended, to, the, pacific, ocean, some, 230, 000, russians, had, settled, in, siberia, by, 1709, siberia, became, one, of, the, destinations, for, sending, internal, exiles, exile, was, the, main, russian, punitive, practice, with, more, than, 800, 000, people, exiled, during, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, great, modern, change, in, siberia, was, the, trans, siberian, railway, constructed, during, 1891, 1916, it, linked, siberia, more, closely, to, the, rapidly, industrialising, russia, of, nicholas, ii, r, 1894, 1917, around, seven, million, russians, moved, to, siberia, from, europe, between, 1801, and, 1914, between, 1859, and, 1917, more, than, half, a, million, people, migrated, to, the, russian, far, east, siberia, has, extensive, natural, resources, during, the, 20th, century, large, scale, exploitation, of, these, took, place, and, industrial, towns, cropped, up, throughout, the, region, at, 7, 15, a, m, on, 30, june, 1908, the, tunguska, event, felled, millions, of, trees, near, the, podkamennaya, tunguska, river, stony, tunguska, river, in, central, siberia, most, scientists, believe, this, resulted, from, the, air, burst, of, a, meteor, or, a, comet, even, though, no, crater, has, ever, been, found, the, landscape, in, the, sparsely, inhabited, area, still, bears, the, scars, of, this, event, in, the, early, decades, of, the, soviet, union, especially, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, government, used, the, gulag, state, agency, to, administer, a, system, of, penal, labour, camps, replacing, the, previous, katorga, system, according, to, semi, official, soviet, estimates, which, did, not, become, public, until, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, government, in, 1991, from, 1929, to, 1953, more, than, 14, million, people, passed, through, these, camps, and, prisons, many, of, them, in, siberia, another, seven, to, eight, million, people, were, internally, deported, to, remote, areas, of, the, soviet, union, including, entire, nationalities, or, ethnicities, in, several, cases, half, a, million, 516, 841, prisoners, died, in, camps, from, 1941, to, 1943, during, world, war, ii, at, other, periods, mortality, was, comparatively, lower, the, size, scope, and, scale, of, the, gulag, slave, labour, camps, remain, subjects, of, much, research, and, debate, many, gulag, camps, operated, in, extremely, remote, areas, of, northeastern, siberia, the, best, known, clusters, included, sevvostlag, the, north, east, camps, along, the, kolyma, and, norillag, near, norilsk, where, 69, 000, prisoners, lived, in, 1952, major, industrial, cities, of, northern, siberia, such, as, norilsk, and, magadan, developed, from, camps, built, by, prisoners, and, run, by, former, prisoners, siberia, spans, an, area, of, 13, 1, million, square, kilometres, 5,

in, asia, but, is, culturally, and, politically, considered, european, since, it, is, a, part, of, russia, major, geographical, zones, within, siberia, include, the, west, siberian, plain, and, the, central, siberian, plateau, eastern, and, central, sakha, comprises, numerous, north, south, mountain, ranges, of, various, ages, these, mountains, extend, up, to, almost, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, but, above, a, few, hundred, metres, they, are, almost, completely, devoid, of, vegetation, the, verkhoyansk, range, was, extensively, glaciated, in, the, pleistocene, but, the, climate, was, too, dry, for, glaciation, to, extend, to, low, elevations, at, these, low, elevations, are, numerous, valleys, many, of, them, deep, and, covered, with, larch, forest, except, in, the, extreme, north, where, the, tundra, dominates, soils, are, mainly, turbels, a, type, of, gelisol, the, active, layer, tends, to, be, less, than, one, metre, deep, except, near, rivers, the, highest, point, in, siberia, is, the, active, volcano, klyuchevskaya, sopka, on, the, kamchatka, peninsula, its, peak, reaches, 4, 750, metres, 15, 580, ft, the, west, siberian, plain, consisting, mostly, of, cenozoic, alluvial, deposits, is, somewhat, flat, in, the, mid, pleistocene, many, deposits, on, this, plain, resulted, from, ice, dams, which, produced, a, large, glacial, lake, this, mid, to, late, pleistocene, lake, blocked, the, northward, flow, of, the, ob, and, yenisey, rivers, resulting, in, a, redirection, southwest, into, the, caspian, and, aral, seas, via, the, turgai, valley, the, area,

named, angaraland, that, formed, an, independent, continent, before, the, permian, see, the, siberian, continent, it, is, exceptionally, rich, in, minerals, containing, large, deposits, of, gold, diamonds, and, ores, of, manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, and, molybdenum, much, of, the, area, includes, the, siberian, traps, a, large, igneous, province, a, massive, eruptive, period, approximately, coincided, with, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, volcanic, event, is, one, of, the, largest, known, volcanic, eruptions, in, earth, s, history, only, the, extreme, northwest, was, glaciated, during, the, quaternary, but, almost, all, is, under, exceptionally, deep, permafrost, and, the, only, tree, that, can, thrive, despite, the, warm, summers, is, the, deciduous, siberian, larch, larix, sibirica, with, its, very, shallow, roots, outside, the, extreme, northwest, the, taiga, is, dominant, covering, a, significant, fraction, of, the, entirety, of,

the, central, siberian, platform, some, authors, refer, to, it, as, the, eastern, siberian, platform, bounded, on, the, northeast, and, east, by, the, late, carboniferous, through, jurassic, verkhoyansk, foldbelt, on, the, northwest, by, the, paleozoic, taymr, foldbelt, and, on, the, southeast, south, and, southwest, by, the, middle, silurian, to, middle, devonian, baykalian, foldbelt, 228, a, regional, geologic, reconnaissance, study, begun, in, 1932, and, followed, by, surface, and, subsurface, mapping, revealed, the, markova, angara, arch, anticline, this, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, markovo, oil, field, in, 1962, with, the, markovo, 1, well, which, produced, from, the, early, cambrian, osa, horizon, bar, sandstone, at, a, depth, of, 2, 156, metres, 7, 073, ft,

while, daytime, temperatures, in, summer, typically, exceed, 20, c, 68, f, with, a, reliable, growing, season, an, abundance, of, sunshine, and, exceedingly, fertile, chernozem, soils, southern, siberia, is, good, enough, for, profitable, agriculture, as, was, demonstrated, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, far, the, most, commonly, occurring, climate, in, siberia, is, continental, subarctic, koppen, dfc, dwc, or, dsc, with, the, annual, average, temperature, about, 5, c, 23, f, and, an, average, for, january, of, 25, c, 13, f, and, an, average, for, july, of, 17, c, 63, f,

quite, heavy, summer, rainfall, researchers, including, sergei, kirpotin, at, tomsk, state, university, and, judith, marquand, at, oxford, university, warn, that, western, siberia, has, begun, to, thaw, as, a, result, of, global, warming, the, frozen, peat, bogs, in, this, region, may, hold, billions, of, tons, of, methane, gas, which, may, be, released, into, the, atmosphere, methane, is, a, greenhouse, gas, 22, times, more, powerful, than, carbon, dioxide, in, 2008, a, research, expedition, for, the, american, geophysical, union, detected, levels, of, methane, up, to, 100, times, above,

outfall, of, the, lena, and, the, area, between, the, laptev, sea, and, east, siberian, sea, since, 1988, experimentation, at, pleistocene, park, has, proposed, to, restore, the, grasslands, of, prehistoric, times, by, conducting, research, on, the, effects, of, large, herbivores, on, permafrost, suggesting, that, animals, rather, than, climate, maintained, the, past, ecosystem, the, nature, reserve, park, also, conducts, climatic, research, on, the, changes, expected, from, the, reintroduction, of, grazing, animals, or, large, herbivores, hypothesizing, that, a, transition, from, tundra, to, grassland, would, lead, to, a, net, change, in, energy, emission, to, absorption, ratios, according, to, vasily, kryuchkov, approximately, 31, 000, square, kilometers, of, the, russian, arctic, has, subjected, to, severe, environmental, disturbance, the, term, siberia, has, both, a, long, history, and, wide, significance, and, association, the, understanding, and, association, of, siberia, have, gradually, changed, during, the, ages, historically, siberia, was, defined, as, the, whole, part, of, russia, and, north, kazakhstan, to, the, east, of, ural, mountains, including, the, russian, far, east, according, to, this, definition, siberia, extended, eastward, from, the, ural, mountains, to, the, pacific, coast, and, southward, from, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, border, of, central, asia, and, the, national, borders, of, both, mongolia, and, china, soviet, era, sources, great, soviet, encyclopedia, and, others, and, modern, russian, ones, usually, define, siberia, as, a, region, extending, eastward, from, the, ural, mountains, to, the, watershed, between, pacific, and, arctic, drainage, basins, and, southward, from, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, hills, of, north, central, kazakhstan, and, the, national, borders, of, both, mongolia, and, china, by, this, definition, siberia, includes, the, federal, subjects, of, the, siberian, federal, district, and, some, of, the, ural, federal, district, as, well, as, sakha, yakutia, republic, which, is, a, part, of, the, far, eastern, federal, district, geographically, this, definition, includes, subdivisions, of, several, other, subjects, of, urals, and, far, eastern, federal, districts, but, they, are, not, included, administratively, this, definition, excludes, sverdlovsk, oblast, and, chelyabinsk, oblast, both, of, which, are, included, in, some, wider, definitions, of, siberia, other, sources, may, use, either, a, somewhat, wider, definition, that, states, the, pacific, coast, not, the, watershed, is, the,
