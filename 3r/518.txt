or, part, as, alashiya, in, contemporary, texts, became, more, connected, to, the, wider, mediterranean, world, driven, by, the, trade, in, copper, extracted, from, the, troodos, mountains, which, stimulated, the, development, of, urbanized, settlements, across, the, island, with, records, suggesting, that, cyprus, at, this, time, was, ruled, by, kings, who, corresponded, with, the, leaders, of, other, mediterranean, states, like, the, pharaohs, of, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, as, documented, in, the, amarna, letters, the, first, recorded, name, of, a, cypriot, king, is, kushmeshusha, as, appears, on, letters, sent, to, ugarit, in, the, 13th, century, bc, at, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, the, island, experienced, two, waves, of, greek, settlement, the, first, wave, consisted, of, mycenaean, greek, traders, who, started, visiting, cyprus, around, 1400, bc, a, major, wave, of, greek, settlement, is, believed, to, have, taken, place, following, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, of, mycenaean, greece, from, 1100, to, 1050, bc, with, the, island, s, predominantly, greek, character, dating, from, this, period, cyprus, occupies, an, important, role, in, greek, mythology, being, the, birthplace, of, aphrodite, and, adonis, and, home, to, king, cinyras, teucer, and, pygmalion, literary, evidence, suggests, an, early, phoenician, presence, at, kition, which, was, under, tyrian, rule, at, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, bc, some, phoenician, merchants, who, were, believed, to, come, from, tyre, colonised, the, area, and, expanded, the, political, influence, of, kition, after, c, 850, bc, the, sanctuaries, were, rebuilt, and, reused, by, the, phoenicians, cyprus, is, at, a, strategic, location, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, it, was, ruled, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, for, a, century, starting, in, 708, bc, before, a, brief, spell, under, egyptian, rule, and, eventually, achaemenid, rule, in, 545, bc, the, cypriots, led, by, onesilus, king, of, salamis, joined, their, fellow, greeks, in, the, ionian, cities, during, the, unsuccessful, ionian, revolt, in, 499, bc, against, the, achaemenids, the, revolt, was, suppressed, but, cyprus, managed, to, maintain, a, high, degree, of, autonomy, and, remained, inclined, towards, the, greek, world, during, the, whole, period, of, the, persian, rule, there, is, a, continuity, in, the, reign, of, the, cypriot, kings, and, during, their, rebellions, they, were, crushed, by, persian, rulers, from, asia, minor, which, is, an, indication, that, the, cypriots, were, ruling, the, island, with, directly, regulated, relations, with, the, great, king, and, there, was, not, a, persian, satrap, the, kingdoms, of, cyprus, enjoyed, special, privileges, and, a, semi, autonomous, status, but, they, were, still, considered, vassal, subjects, of, the, great, king, the, island, was, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, in, 333, bc, and, cypriot, navy, helped, alexander, during, the, siege, of, tyre, 332, bc, the, cypriot, fleet, was, also, sent, to, help, amphoterus, in, addition, alexander, had, two, cypriot, generals, stasander, and, stasanor, both, from, the, soli, and, later, both, became, satraps, in, alexander, s, empire, following, alexander, s, death, the, division, of, his, empire, and, the, subsequent, wars, of, the, diadochi, cyprus, became, part, of, the, hellenistic, empire, of, ptolemaic, egypt, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, island, was, fully, hellenized, in, 58, bc, cyprus, was, acquired, by, the, roman, republic, and, became, roman, cyprus, in, 22, bc, when, the, roman, empire, was, divided, into, eastern, and, western, parts, in, 286, cyprus, became, part, of, the, east, roman, empire, also, called, the, byzantine, empire, and, would, remain, so, for, some, 900, years, under, byzantine, rule, the, greek, orientation, that, had, been, prominent, since, antiquity, developed, the, strong, hellenistic, christian, character, that, continues, to, be, a, hallmark, of, the, greek, cypriot, community, beginning, in, 649, cyprus, endured, repeated, attacks, and, raids, launched, by, umayyad, caliphate, many, were, quick, piratical, raids, but, others, were, large, scale, attacks, in, which, many, cypriots, were, slaughtered, and, great, wealth, carried, off, or, destroyed, the, city, of, salamis, was, destroyed, and, never, rebuilt, in, 688, emperor, justinian, ii, and, caliph, abd, al, malik, signed, a, treaty, whereby, cyprus, would, be, paying, an, equal, amount, of, tribute, to, the, caliphate, and, tax, to, the, empire, and, would, remain, neutral, in, status, to, both, byzantine, control, remained, stronger, in, the, northern, coast, the, arabs, exerted, more, influence, in, the, south, there, are, no, byzantine, churches, which, survive, from, this, period, and, the, island, entered, a, period, of, impoverishment, full, byzantine, rule, was, restored, in, 965, when, emperor, nikephoros, ii, phokas, scored, decisive, victories, on, land, and, sea, in, 1156, raynald, of, ch, tillon, and, thoros, ii, of, armenia, brutally, sacked, cyprus, over, a, period, of, three, weeks, stealing, so, much, plunder, and, capturing, so, many, of, the, leading, citizens, and, their, families, for, ransom, that, the, island, took, generations, to, recover, several, greek, priests, were, mutilated, and, sent, away, to, constantinople, in, 1185, isaac, komnenos, a, member, of, the, byzantine, imperial, family, took, over, cyprus, and, declared, it, independent, of, the, empire, in, 1191, during, the, third, crusade, richard, i, of, england, captured, the, island, from, isaac, he, used, it, as, a, major, supply, base, that, was, relatively, safe, from, the, saracens, a, year, later, richard, sold, the, island, to, the, knights, templar, who, following, a, bloody, revolt, in, turn, sold, it, to, guy, of, lusignan, his, brother, and, successor, aimery, was, recognised, as, king, of, cyprus, by, henry, vi, holy, roman, emperor, following, the, death, in, 1473, of, james, ii, the, last, lusignan, king, the, republic, of, venice, assumed, control, of, the, island, while, the, late, king, s, venetian, widow, queen, catherine, cornaro, reigned, as, figurehead, venice, formally, annexed, the, kingdom, of, cyprus, in, 1489, following, the, abdication, of, catherine, the, venetians, fortified, nicosia, by, building, the, walls, of, nicosia, and, used, it, as, an, important, commercial, hub, throughout, venetian, rule, the, ottoman, empire, frequently, raided, cyprus, in, 1539, the, ottomans, destroyed, limassol, and, so, fearing, the, worst, the, venetians, also, fortified, famagusta, and, kyrenia, although, the, lusignan, french, aristocracy, remained, the, dominant, social, class, in, cyprus, throughout, the, medieval, period, the, former, assumption, that, greeks, were, treated, only, as, serfs, on, the, island, is, no, longer, considered, by, academics, to, be, accurate, it, is, now, accepted, that, the, medieval, period, saw, increasing, numbers, of, greek, cypriots, elevated, to, the, upper, classes, a, growing, greek, middle, ranks, and, the, lusignan, royal, household, even, marrying, greeks, this, included, king, john, ii, of, cyprus, who, married, helena, palaiologina, in, 1570, a, full, scale, ottoman, assault, with, 60, 000, troops, brought, the, island, under, ottoman, control, despite, stiff, resistance, by, the, inhabitants, of, nicosia, and, famagusta, ottoman, forces, capturing, cyprus, massacred, many, greek, and, armenian, christian, inhabitants, the, previous, latin, elite, were, destroyed, and, the, first, significant, demographic, change, since, antiquity, took, place, with, the, formation, of, a, muslim, community, soldiers, who, fought, in, the, conquest, settled, on, the, island, and, turkish, peasants, and, craftsmen, were, brought, to, the, island, from, anatolia, this, new, community, also, included, banished, anatolian, tribes, undesirable, persons, and, members, of, various, troublesome, muslim, sects, as, well, as, a, number, of, new, converts, on, the, island, the, ottomans, abolished, the, feudal, system, previously, in, place, and, applied, the, millet, system, to, cyprus, under, which, non, muslim, peoples, were, governed, by, their, own, religious, authorities, in, a, reversal, from, the, days, of, latin, rule, the, head, of, the, church, of, cyprus, was, invested, as, leader, of, the, greek, cypriot, population, and, acted, as, mediator, between, christian, greek, cypriots, and, the, ottoman, authorities, this, status, ensured, that, the, church, of, cyprus, was, in, a, position, to, end, the, constant, encroachments, of, the, roman, catholic, church, ottoman, rule, of, cyprus, was, at, times, indifferent, at, times, oppressive, depending, on, the, temperaments, of, the, sultans, and, local, officials, the, ratio, of, muslims, to, christians, fluctuated, throughout, the, period, of, ottoman, domination, in, 1777, 78, 47, 000, muslims, constituted, a, majority, over, the, island, s, 37, 000, christians, by, 1872, the, population, of, the, island, had, risen, to, 144, 000, comprising, 44, 000, muslims, and, 100, 000, christians, the, muslim, population, included, numerous, crypto, christians, including, the, linobambaki, a, crypto, catholic, community, that, arose, due, to, religious, persecution, of, the, catholic, community, by, the, ottoman, authorities, this, community, would, assimilate, into, the, turkish, cypriot, community, during, british, rule, as, soon, as, the, greek, war, of, independence, broke, out, in, 1821, several, greek, cypriots, left, for, greece, to, join, the, greek, forces, in, response, the, ottoman, governor, of, cyprus, arrested, and, executed, 486, prominent, greek, cypriots, including, the, archbishop, of, cyprus, kyprianos, and, four, other, bishops, in, 1828, modern, greece, s, first, president, ioannis, kapodistrias, called, for, union, of, cyprus, with, greece, and, numerous, minor, uprisings, took, place, reaction, to, ottoman, misrule, led, to, uprisings, by, both, greek, and, turkish, cypriots, although, none, were, successful, after, centuries, of, neglect, by, the, ottoman, empire, the, poverty, of, most, of, the, people, and, the, ever, present, tax, collectors, fueled, greek, nationalism, and, by, the, 20th, century, the, idea, of, union, with, newly, independent, greece, was, firmly, rooted, among, greek, cypriots, under, ottoman, rule, numeracy, school, enrolment, and, literacy, rates, were, all, low, they, persisted, some, time, after, ottoman, rule, ended, and, then, increased, rapidly, during, the, twentieth, century, in, the, aftermath, of, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 1878, and, the, congress, of, berlin, cyprus, was, leased, to, the, british, empire, which, de, facto, took, over, its, administration, in, 1878, though, in, terms, of, sovereignty, cyprus, remained, a, de, jure, ottoman, territory, until, 5, november, 1914, together, with, egypt, and, sudan, in, exchange, for, guarantees, that, britain, would, use, the, island, as, a, base, to, protect, the, ottoman, empire, against, possible, russian, aggression, the, island, would, serve, britain, as, a, key, military, base, for, its, colonial, routes, by, 1906, when, the, famagusta, harbour, was, completed, cyprus, was, a, strategic, naval, outpost, overlooking, the, suez, canal, the, crucial, main, route, to, india, which, was, then, britain, s, most, important, overseas, possession, following, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, and, the, decision, of, the, ottoman, empire, to, join, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, on, 5, november, 1914, the, british, empire, formally, annexed, cyprus, and, declared, the, ottoman, khedivate, of, egypt, and, sudan, a, sultanate, and, british, protectorate, in, october, 1915, britain, offered, cyprus, to, greece, ruled, by, king, constantine, i, of, greece, on, the, condition, that, greece, join, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, british, and, went, to, serbia, s, assistance, in, order, to, fulfill, her, treaty, obligations, under, the, serbo, greek, pact, of, may, 1913, it, gave, greece, a, golden, opportunity, in, achieving, enosis, with, cyprus, alternatively, it, was, a, lost, opportunity, when, the, zaimis, administration, declined, the, british, proposal, in, 1923, under, the, treaty, of, lausanne, the, nascent, turkish, republic, relinquished, any, claim, to, cyprus, and, in, 1925, it, was, declared, a, british, crown, colony, during, the, second, world, war, many, greek, and, turkish, cypriots, enlisted, in, the, cyprus, regiment, the, greek, cypriot, population, meanwhile, had, become, hopeful, that, the, british, administration, would, lead, to, enosis, the, idea, of, enosis, was, historically, part, of, the, megali, idea, a, greater, political, ambition, of, a, greek, state, encompassing, the, territories, with, large, greek, populations, in, the, former, ottoman, empire, including, cyprus, and, asia, minor, with, a, capital, in, constantinople, and, was, actively, pursued, by, the, cypriot, orthodox, church, which, had, its, members, educated, in, greece, these, religious, officials, together, with, greek, military, officers, and, professionals, some, of, whom, still, pursued, the, megali, idea, would, later, found, the, guerrilla, organisation, eoka, ethniki, organosis, kyprion, agoniston, or, national, organisation, of, cypriot, fighters, the, greek, cypriots, viewed, the, island, as, historically, greek, and, believed, that, union, with, greece, was, a, natural, right, in, the, 1950s, the, pursuit, of, enosis, became, a, part, of, the, greek, national, policy, initially, the, turkish, cypriots, favoured, the, continuation, of, the, british, rule, however, they, were, alarmed, by, the, greek, cypriot, calls, for, enosis, as, they, saw, the, union, of, crete, with, greece, which, led, to, the, exodus, of, cretan, turks, as, a, precedent, to, be, avoided, and, they, took, a, pro, partition, stance, in, response, to, the, militant, activity, of, eoka, the, turkish, cypriots, also, viewed, themselves, as, a, distinct, ethnic, group, of, the, island, and, believed, in, their, having, a, separate, right, to, self, determination, from, greek, cypriots, meanwhile, in, the, 1950s, turkish, leader, menderes, considered, cyprus, an, extension, of, anatolia, rejected, the, partition, of, cyprus, along, ethnic, lines, and, favoured, the, annexation, of, the, whole, island, to, turkey, nationalistic, slogans, centred, on, the, idea, that, cyprus, is, turkish, and, the, ruling, party, declared, cyprus, to, be, a, part, of, the, turkish, homeland, that, was, vital, to, its, security, upon, realising, that, the, fact, that, the, turkish, cypriot, population, was, only, 20, of, the, islanders, made, annexation, unfeasible, the, national, policy, was, changed, to, favour, partition, the, slogan, partition, or, death, was, frequently, used, in, turkish, cypriot, and, turkish, protests, starting, in, the, late, 1950s, and, continuing, throughout, the, 1960s, although, after, the, z, rich, and, london, conferences, turkey, seemed, to, accept, the, existence, of, the, cypriot, state, and, to, distance, itself, from, its, policy, of, favouring, the, partition, of, the, island, the, goal, of, the, turkish, and, turkish, cypriot, leaders, remained, that, of, creating, an, independent, turkish, state, in, the, northern, part, of, the, island, in, january, 1950, the, church, of, cyprus, organised, a, referendum, under, the, supervision, of, clerics, and, with, no, turkish, cypriot, participation, where, 96, of, the, participating, greek, cypriots, voted, in, favour, of, enosis, 9, the, greeks, were, 80, 2, of, the, total, island, s, population, at, the, time, census, 1946, restricted, autonomy, under, a, constitution, was, proposed, by, the, british, administration, but, eventually, rejected, in, 1955, the, eoka, organisation, was, founded, seeking, union, with, greece, through, armed, struggle, at, the, same, time, the, turkish, resistance, organisation, tmt, calling, for, taksim, or, partition, was, established, by, the, turkish, cypriots, as, a, counterweight, british, officials, also, tolerated, the, creation, of, the, turkish, underground, organisation, tmt, the, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, in, a, letter, dated, 15, july, 1958, had, advised, the, governor, of, cyprus, not, to, act, against, tmt, despite, its, illegal, actions, so, as, not, to, harm, british, relations, with, the, turkish, government, during, british, rule, the, future, of, the, island, became, a, matter, of, disagreement, between, the, two, prominent, ethnic, communities, greek, cypriots, who, made, up, 77, of, the, population, in, 1960, and, turkish, cypriots, who, made, up, 18, of, the, population, from, the, 19th, century, onwards, the, greek, cypriot, population, pursued, enosis, union, with, greece, which, became, a, greek, national, policy, in, the, 1950s, the, turkish, cypriot, population, initially, advocated, the, continuation, of, the, british, rule, then, demanded, the, annexation, of, the, island, to, turkey, and, in, the, 1950s, together, with, turkey, established, a, policy, of, taksim, the, partition, of, cyprus, and, the, creation, of, a, turkish, polity, in, the, north, cyprus, was, granted, independence, in, 1960, following, an, armed, campaign, spearheaded, by, eoka, as, per, the, z, rich, and, london, agreement, cyprus, officially, attained, independence, on, 16, august, 1960, and, at, the, time, had, a, total, population, of, 573, 566, of, whom, 442, 138, 77, 1, were, greeks, 104, 320, 18, 2, turks, and, 27, 108, 4, 7, others, the, uk, retained, the, two, sovereign, base, areas, of, akrotiri, and, dhekelia, while, government, posts, and, public, offices, were, allocated, by, ethnic, quotas, giving, the, minority, turkish, cypriots, a, permanent, veto, 30, in, parliament, and, administration, and, granting, the,
