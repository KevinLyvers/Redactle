the, gal, pagos, islands, spanish, islas, gal, pagos, are, an, archipelago, of, volcanic, islands, in, the, eastern, pacific, located, around, the, equator, 900, km, 560, mi, west, of, the, mainland, of, south, america, they, form, the, gal, pagos, province, of, the, republic, of, ecuador, with, a, population, of, slightly, over, 33, 000, 2020, the, province, is, divided, into, the, cantons, of, san, crist, bal, santa, cruz, and, isabela, the, three, most, populated, islands, in, the, chain, the, gal, pagos, are, famous, for, their, large, number, of, endemic, species, which, were, studied, by, charles, darwin, in, the, 1830s, and, inspired, his, theory, of, evolution, by, means, of, natural, selection, all, of, these, islands, are, protected, as, part, of, ecuador, s, gal, pagos, national, park, and, marine, reserve, thus, far, there, is, no, firm, evidence, that, polynesians, or, the, indigenous, peoples, of, south, america, reached, the, islands, before, their, accidental, discovery, by, bishop, tom, s, de, berlanga, in, 1535, if, some, visitors, did, arrive, poor, access, to, fresh, water, on, the, islands, seems, to, have, limited, settlement, the, spanish, empire, similarly, ignored, the, islands, although, during, the, golden, age, of, piracy, various, pirates, used, the, gal, pagos, as, a, base, for, raiding, spanish, shipping, along, the, peruvian, coast, the, goats, and, black, and, brown, rats, introduced, during, this, period, greatly, damaged, the, existing, ecosystems, of, several, islands, british, sailors, were, chiefly, responsible, for, exploring, and, mapping, the, area, darwin, s, voyage, on, hms, beagle, was, part, of, an, extensive, british, survey, of, the, coasts, of, south, america, ecuador, which, won, its, independence, from, spain, in, 1822, and, left, gran, colombia, in, 1830, formally, occupied, and, claimed, the, islands, on, 12, february, 1832, while, the, voyage, was, ongoing, jos, de, villamil, the, founder, of, the, ecuadorian, navy, led, the, push, to, colonize, and, settle, the, islands, gradually, supplanting, the, english, names, of, the, major, islands, with, spanish, ones, the, united, states, built, the, islands, first, airport, as, a, base, to, protect, the, western, approaches, of, the, panama, canal, in, the, 1930s, after, world, war, ii, its, facilities, were, transferred, to, ecuador, with, the, growing, importance, of, ecotourism, to, the, local, economy, the, airport, modernized, in, the, 2010s, using, recycled, materials, for, any, expansion, and, shifting, entirely, to, renewable, energy, sources, to, handle, its, roughly, 300, 000, visitors, each, year, the, gal, pagos, or, galapagos, islands, are, named, for, their, giant, tortoises, which, were, more, plentiful, at, the, time, of, their, discovery, the, spanish, word, gal, pago, derives, from, a, pre, roman, iberian, word, meaning, turtle, the, meaning, it, still, has, in, most, dialects, within, ecuadorian, spanish, however, it, is, now, also, used, to, describe, the, islands, large, tortoises, the, islands, name, is, pronounced, in, most, dialects, of, spanish, but, by, locals, the, accent, over, the, second, a, does, not, change, the, name, s, pronunciation, but, moves, the, stress, from, the, 3rd, syllable, to, the, 2nd, it, is, usually, read, l, p, s, in, british, english, and, l, p, s, in, american, english, the, name, is, first, attested, as, the, spanish, latin, hybrid, insulae, de, los, galopegos, islands, of, the, turtles, on, the, map, of, the, americas, in, abraham, ortelius, s, theater, of, the, lands, of, the, world, theatrum, orbis, terrarum, first, published, in, 1570, the, islands, were, also, previously, known, as, the, enchanted, isles, or, islands, islas, encantadas, from, sailors, difficulty, with, the, winds, and, currents, around, them, as, the, ecuador, archipelago, archipi, lago, de, ecuador, or, archipelago, of, the, equator, archipi, lago, del, ecuador, following, their, settlement, by, ecuador, in, 1832, and, as, the, colon, or, columbus, archipelago, archipi, lago, del, col, n, in, 1892, upon, the, quadricentennial, of, columbus, s, first, voyage, the, islands, were, mapped, by, the, english, buccaneer, william, ambrosia, cowley, in, 1684, and, by, the, british, captain, james, colnett, in, 1793, the, names, they, chose, to, honour, british, kings, nobles, and, naval, officers, of, their, eras, continued, to, be, used, for, the, major, islands, until, recently, and, are, still, used, for, many, of, the, smaller, islets, the, spanish, names, have, varied, over, time, but, the, current, official, names, have, gradually, supplanted, the, english, ones, for, most, of, the, major, islands, volcanism, has, been, continuous, on, the, gal, pagos, islands, for, at, least, 20, million, years, and, perhaps, even, longer, the, mantle, plume, beneath, the, east, ward, moving, nazca, plate, 51, km, myr, has, given, rise, to, a, 3, kilometre, thick, platform, under, the, island, chain, and, seamounts, besides, the, gal, pagos, archipelago, other, key, tectonic, features, in, the, region, include, the, northern, gal, pagos, volcanic, province, between, the, archipelago, and, the, gal, pagos, spreading, center, gsc, 200, km, 120, mi, to, the, north, at, the, boundary, of, the, nazca, plate, and, the, cocos, plate, this, spreading, center, truncates, into, the, east, pacific, rise, on, the, west, and, is, bounded, by, the, cocos, ridge, and, carnegie, ridge, in, the, east, furthermore, the, gal, pagos, hotspot, is, at, the, northern, boundary, of, the, pacific, large, low, shear, velocity, province, while, the, easter, hotspot, is, on, the, southern, boundary, the, gal, pagos, archipelago, is, characterized, by, numerous, contemporaneous, volcanoes, some, with, plume, magma, sources, others, from, the, asthenosphere, possibly, due, to, the, young, and, thin, oceanic, crust, the, gsc, caused, structural, weaknesses, in, this, thin, lithosphere, leading, to, eruptions, forming, the, gal, pagos, platform, fernandina, and, isabela, in, particular, are, aligned, along, these, weaknesses, lacking, a, well, defined, rift, zone, the, islands, have, a, high, rate, of, inflation, prior, to, eruption, sierra, negra, on, isabela, island, experienced, a, 240, cm, 94, in, uplift, between, 1992, and, 1998, most, recent, eruption, in, 2005, while, fernandina, on, fernandina, island, indicated, an, uplift, of, 90, cm, 35, in, most, recent, eruption, in, 2009, alcedo, on, isabela, island, had, an, uplift, of, greater, than, 90, cm, most, recent, eruption, in, 1993, additional, characteristics, of, the, gal, pagos, archipelago, are, closer, volcano, spacing, smaller, volcano, sizes, and, larger, calderas, for, instance, isabela, island, includes, six, major, volcanoes, ecuador, wolf, darwin, alcedo, sierra, negra, and, cerro, azul, with, most, recent, eruptions, ranging, from, 1813, to, 2008, the, neighboring, islands, of, santiago, and, fernandina, last, erupted, in, 1906, and, 2009, respectively, overall, the, nine, active, volcanoes, in, the, archipelago, have, erupted, 24, times, between, 1961, and, 2011, the, shape, of, these, volcanoes, is, tall, and, rounded, as, opposed, wide, and, smooth, in, the, hawaiian, islands, the, gal, pagos, s, shape, is, due, to, the, pattern, of, radial, and, circumferential, fissure, radial, on, the, flanks, but, circumferential, near, the, caldera, summits, it, is, the, circumferential, fissures, which, give, rise, to, stacks, of, short, lava, flows, the, volcanoes, at, the, west, end, of, the, archipelago, are, in, general, taller, younger, have, well, developed, calderas, and, are, mostly, composed, of, tholeiitic, basalt, while, those, on, the, east, are, shorter, older, lack, calderas, and, have, a, more, diverse, composition, the, ages, of, the, islands, from, west, to, east, are, 0, 05, ma, for, fernandina, 0, 65, ma, for, isabela, 1, 10, ma, for, santiago, 1, 7, ma, for, santa, cruz, 2, 90, ma, for, santa, fe, and, 3, 2, ma, for, san, cristobal, the, calderas, on, sierra, negra, and, alcedo, have, active, fault, systems, the, sierra, negra, fault, is, associated, with, a, sill, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, below, the, caldera, the, caldera, on, fernandina, experienced, the, largest, basaltic, volcano, collapse, in, history, with, the, 1968, phreatomagmatic, eruption, fernandina, has, also, been, the, most, active, volcano, since, 1790, with, recent, eruptions, in, 1991, 1995, 2005, and, 2009, and, the, entire, surface, has, been, covered, in, numerous, flows, since, 4, 3, ka, the, western, volcanoes, have, numerous, tuff, cones, the, islands, are, located, in, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, 973, km, 605, mi, off, the, west, coast, of, south, america, the, majority, of, islands, are, also, more, broadly, part, of, the, south, pacific, the, closest, land, mass, is, that, of, mainland, ecuador, the, country, to, which, they, belong, 926, km, 500, nmi, to, the, east, the, islands, are, found, at, the, coordinates, 1, 40, n, 1, 36, s, 89, 16, 92, 01, w, straddling, the, equator, islands, in, the, chain, are, located, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, with, volc, n, wolf, and, volc, n, ecuador, on, isla, isabela, being, directly, on, the, equator, espa, ola, island, the, southernmost, islet, of, the, archipelago, and, darwin, island, the, northernmost, one, are, spread, out, over, a, distance, of, 220, km, 137, mi, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, considers, them, wholly, within, the, south, pacific, ocean, however, the, gal, pagos, archipelago, consists, of, 7, 880, km, 2, 3, 040, sq, mi, of, land, spread, over, 45, 000, km, 2, 17, 000, sq, mi, of, ocean, the, largest, of, the, islands, isabela, measures, 2, 250, square, miles, 5, 800, km, 2, and, makes, up, close, to, three, quarters, of, the, total, land, area, of, the, gal, pagos, volc, n, wolf, on, isabela, is, the, highest, point, with, an, elevation, of, 1, 707, m, 5, 600, ft, above, sea, level, the, group, consists, of, 18, main, islands, 3, smaller, islands, and, 107, rocks, and, islets, the, islands, are, located, at, the, galapagos, triple, junction, the, archipelago, is, located, on, the, nazca, plate, a, tectonic, plate, which, is, moving, east, southeast, diving, under, the, south, american, plate, at, a, rate, of, about, 2, 5, inches, 6, 4, cm, per, year, it, is, also, atop, the, gal, pagos, hotspot, a, place, where, the, earth, s, crust, is, being, melted, from, below, by, a, mantle, plume, creating, volcanoes, the, first, islands, formed, here, at, least, 8, million, and, possibly, up, to, 90, million, years, ago, while, the, older, islands, have, disappeared, below, the, sea, as, they, moved, away, from, the, mantle, plume, the, youngest, islands, isabela, and, fernandina, are, still, being, formed, in, april, 2009, lava, from, the, volcanic, island, fernandina, started, flowing, both, towards, the, island, s, shoreline, and, into, the, center, caldera, in, late, june, 2018, sierra, negra, one, of, five, volcanoes, on, isabela, and, one, of, the, most, active, in, the, galapagos, archipelago, began, erupting, for, the, first, time, since, 2005, lava, flows, made, their, way, to, the, coastline, prompting, the, evacuation, of, about, fifty, nearby, residents, and, restricting, tourist, access, the, 18, main, islands, each, having, a, land, area, at, least, 1, km, 2, of, the, archipelago, with, their, english, names, shown, alphabetically, mosquera, is, also, home, to, one, of, the, largest, colonies, of, sea, lions, in, the, galapagos, and, there, have, been, occasional, orca, whale, sightings, around, the, islet, as, is, usual, in, the, archipelago, the, islet, is, shared, by, many, seabirds, marine, iguanas, blue, footed, boobies, and, sally, lightfoot, crabs, although, the, islands, are, located, on, the, equator, the, humboldt, current, brings, cold, water, to, them, causing, frequent, drizzles, during, most, of, the, year, the, weather, is, regularly, influenced, by, the, el, ni, o, events, which, occur, every, 3, to, 7, years, and, bring, warmer, sea, surface, temperatures, a, rise, in, sea, level, greater, wave, action, and, a, depletion, of, nutrients, in, the, water, this, cycle, can, greatly, affect, the, precipitation, from, one, year, to, another, at, charles, darwin, station, the, precipitation, during, the, month, of, march, in, the, particularly, wet, year, of, 1969, was, 249, 0, mm, 9, 80, in, but, during, march, 1970, the, next, year, it, was, only, 1, 2, mm, 0, 047, in, there, is, also, a, large, range, in, precipitation, from, one, place, to, another, and, across, the, islands, two, main, seasons, the, archipelago, is, mainly, characterized, by, a, mixture, of, a, tropical, savanna, climate, and, a, semi, arid, climate, transitioning, to, a, tropical, rainforest, climate, in, the, northwest, during, the, rainy, season, known, as, the, gar, a, from, june, to, november, the, temperature, near, the, sea, is, around, 22, c, 72, f, a, steady, cool, wind, blows, from, south, and, southeast, frequent, drizzles, gar, as, for, days, and, dense, fog, conceals, the, islands, during, the, warm, season, from, december, to, may, the, average, sea, and, air, temperatures, rise, to, around, 25, c, 77, f, there, is, no, wind, at, all, and, the, sun, shines, apart, from, sporadic, strong, downpours, weather, also, changes, as, altitude, increases, on, the, larger, islands, temperature, decreases, gradually, with, altitude, while, precipitation, increases, due, to, the, condensation, of, moisture, from, clouds, on, the, slopes, this, pattern, of, generally, wet, highlands, and, drier, lowlands, affects, the, plant, life, on, the, larger, islands, the, vegetation, in, the, highlands, tends, to, be, green, and, lush, with, tropical, woodland, in, places, the, lowland, areas, tend, to, have, arid, and, semi, arid, vegetation, with, many, thorny, shrubs, and, cacti, and, areas, of, barren, volcanic, rock, some, islands, also, fall, within, the, rain, shadow, of, others, during, some, seasons, during, march, 1969, the, precipitation, over, charles, darwin, station, on, the, southern, coast, of, santa, cruz, was, 249, 0, mm, 9, 80, in, while, on, nearby, baltra, island, the, precipitation, during, the, same, month, was, only, 137, 6, mm, 5, 42, in, this, is, because, baltra, is, located, behind, santa, cruz, when, the, prevailing, winds, are, southerly, causing, more, moisture, to, fall, on, the, santa, cruz, highlands, the, following, table, for, the, especially, wet, year, of, 1969, shows, the, variation, of, precipitation, in, different, places, of, santa, cruz, island, most, of, the, gal, pagos, is, covered, in, semi, desert, vegetation, including, shrublands, grasslands, and, dry, forest, a, few, of, the, islands, have, high, elevation, areas, with, cooler, temperatures, and, higher, rainfall, which, are, home, to, humid, climate, forests, and, shrublands, and, montane, grasslands, pampas, at, the, highest, elevations, there, are, about, 500, species, of, native, vascular, plants, on, the, islands, including, 90, species, of, ferns, about, 180, vascular, plant, species, are, endemic, the, islands, are, well, known, for, their, distinctive, endemic, species, including, giant, tortoises, finches, flightless, cormorants, gal, pagos, lava, lizards, and, marine, iguanas, which, evolved, to, adapt, to, islands, environments, whether, polynesians, or, the, indigenous, peoples, of, south, america, ever, made, it, to, the, islands, is, disputed, oceanic, pacific, islands, in, the, same, general, area, as, gal, pagos, including, clipperton, cocos, the, desventuradas, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, and, the, revillagigedos, were, all, uninhabited, when, discovered, by, europeans, with, no, evidence, to, indicate, any, prehistoric, human, activity, the, easternmost, oceanic, island, in, the, south, pacific, that, was, discovered, with, a, human, population, was, easter, island, whose, rapa, nui, people, are, known, to, be, polynesian, rather, than, south, american, in, 1572, the, spanish, chronicler, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, claimed, that, topa, inca, yupanqui, the, second, sapa, inca, of, the, inca, empire, had, visited, the, archipelago, there, is, however, little, evidence, for, this, and, many, experts, consider, it, a, far, fetched, legend, especially, since, the, incas, were, not, typically, a, seafaring, people, a, 1952, archaeological, survey, by, thor, heyerdahl, and, arne, skj, lsvold, found, potsherds, and, other, artifacts, from, several, sites, on, the, islands, that, they, claimed, suggested, visitation, by, south, americans, during, the, pre, columbian, era, the, group, located, an, inca, flute, and, shards, from, more, than, 130, pieces, of, ceramics, later, identified, as, pre, incan, however, no, remains, of, graves, ceremonial, vessels, or, buildings, have, ever, been, found, suggesting, no, permanent, settlement, occurred, before, the, spanish, arrived, in, the, 16th, century, a, 2016, reanalysis, of, heyerdahl, and, skj, lsvold, s, archaeological, sites, rejected, their, conclusions, they, found, that, at, all, locations, excavated, by, the, 1952, survey, artifacts, of, indian, and, european, origin, were, interspersed, without, the, distinct, spatial, or, stratigraphic, arrangement, that, would, be, expected, from, independent, sequential, deposition, heyerdahl, and, skj, lsvold, had, noted, this, in, their, original, report, while, ignoring, its, implications, radiocarbon, dates, from, the, sites, placed, them, in, the, post, spanish, era, and, preliminary, paleoenvironmental, analysis, showed, no, disturbance, older, than, 500, years, before, present, suggesting, no, evidence, from, the, survey, that, the, islands, were, visited, prior, to, their, spanish, discovery, in, 1535, the, authors, suggested, that, native, artifacts, found, by, heyerdahl, and, skj, lsvold, had, probably, been, brought, as, mementos, or, souvenirs, at, the, time, of, spanish, occupation, a, 2008, report, by, archeologists, from, the, australian, national, university, stated, that, certain, asia, pacific, taxa, may, have, been, growing, in, the, gal, pagos, prior, to, 1535, this, opens, a, direction, for, future, research, which, might, constitute, a, strong, line, of, evidence, for, accidental, or, deliberate, landfall, in, the, gal, pagos, by, a, polynesian, vessel, although, the, report, noted, current, scholarship, finds, no, evidence, that, pacific, islands, beyond, easter, island, play, a, stepping, stone, role, in, the, interaction, between, amerindians, or, polynesians, in, prehistory, the, lack, of, fresh, water, on, the, islands, seems, to, have, limited, visits, and, settlement, if, any, ever, occurred, european, discovery, of, the, gal, pagos, islands, is, recorded, occurring, on, 10, march, 1535, when, the, spanish, bishop, of, panama, tom, s, de, berlanga, sailing, to, peru, to, adjudicate, a, dispute, between, francisco, pizarro, and, diego, de, almagro, drifted, off, course, while, his, ship, was, becalmed, in, the, doldrums, they, found, the, islands, they, visited, uninhabited, and, so, arid, and, barren, that, two, men, and, ten, horses, died, for, lack, of, fresh, water, and, the, rest, were, forced, to, subsist, on, cactus, pads, the, ship, left, them, unclaimed, and, unsettled, berlanga, however, wrote, a, brief, account, of, the, islands, their, condition, and, their, main, wildlife, for, charles, v, the, gal, pagos, islands, first, appeared, on, the, maps, of, gerardus, mercator, and, abraham, ortelius, around, 1570, the, first, english, captain, to, visit, the, gal, pagos, islands, was, richard, hawkins, in, 1593, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, archipelago, was, often, used, as, a, hideout, by, mostly, english, pirates, who, attacked, spanish, treasure, fleets, carrying, gold, silver, and, supplies, from, peru, to, panama, and, spain, the, english, pirate, william, ambrosia, cowley, thoroughly, mapped, the, islands, in, 1684, while, sailing, on, john, cook, s, batchelor, s, or, bachelor, s, delight, and, john, eaton, s, nicholas, as, they, raided, peruvian, shipping, one, cargo, captured, that, year, was, 7, 8, tuns, of, quince, marmalade, whose, remains, scattered, pottery, around, the, islands, publishing, the, first, thorough, chart, of, the, islands, cowley, coined, the, english, names, for, 16, of, the, islands, chiefly, honoring, english, royalty, nobles, and, jamaican, officials, of, the, era, who, might, provide, future, patronage, in, 1793, during, the, early, french, revolutionary, wars, the, british, captain, james, colnett, described, the, flora, and, fauna, of, gal, pagos, and, suggested, the, islands, could, be, used, as, a, base, for, whalers, operating, in, the, pacific, colnett, improved, upon, cowley, s, chart, coining, additional, names, although, accidentally, transferring, cowley, s, charles, island, from, espa, ola, to, floreana, whalers, and, maritime, fur, traders, killed, and, captured, thousands, of, the, gal, pagos, tortoises, to, extract, their, fat, the, tortoises, could, be, kept, on, board, ship, as, a, means, of, providing, of, fresh, protein, as, these, animals, could, survive, for, several, months, on, board, without, any, food, or, water, the, hunting, of, the, tortoises, was, responsible, for, greatly, diminishing, and, in, some, cases, eliminating, certain, species, along, with, whalers, came, the, fur, seal, hunters, who, brought, the, population, of, this, animal, close, to, extinction, the, first, known, permanent, human, resident, on, gal, pagos, was, patrick, watkins, an, irish, sailor, who, was, marooned, on, the, floreana, from, 1807, to, 1809, according, to, later, accounts, watkins, managed, to, survive, by, hunting, growing, vegetables, and, trading, with, visiting, whalers, before, stealing, a, longboat, from, a, whaling, ship, impressing, five, of, its, crew, as, his, slaves, and, navigating, to, guayaquil, on, the, ecuadorian, mainland, watkins, was, the, only, one, of, the, six, to, survive, the, journey, in, 1818, the, nantucket, whaleship, globe, under, captain, george, washington, gardner, discovered, a, mother, lode, of, sperm, whales, some, thousand, miles, west, of, the, south, american, coast, approximately, at, the, equator, he, returned, to, nantucket, in, 1820, with, more, than, 2, 000, barrels, of, sperm, whale, oil, and, the, news, of, his, discovery, this, led, to, an, influx, of, whaleships, to, exploit, the, new, whaling, ground, and, the, gal, pagos, islands, became, a, frequent, stop, for, the, whalers, both, before, and, after, visiting, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, offshore, grounds, this, led, to, the, establishment, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, of, a, kind, of, unofficial, post, office, where, whaleships, stopped, to, pick, up, and, drop, off, letters, as, well, as, for, provisioning, and, repairing, in, october, 1820, the, whaleship, essex, out, of, nantucket, stopped, at, the, gal, pagos, for, these, purposes, on, its, way, to, the, offshore, grounds, on, colnett, s, charles, island, while, most, of, the, crew, were, hunting, tortoises, one, crewmember, english, boatsteerer, thomas, chappel, for, reasons, still, unclear, lit, a, fire, which, quickly, burned, out, of, control, some, of, the, tortoise, hunters, had, a, narrow, escape, and, had, to, run, a, gauntlet, of, fire, to, get, back, to, the, ship, soon, almost, the, entire, island, was, in, flames, crewmembers, reported, that, after, a, day, of, sailing, away, they, could, still, see, the, flames, against, the, horizon, one, crewmember, who, returned, to, the, gal, pagos, several, years, afterward, described, the, entire, island, as, still, a, blackened, wasteland, ecuador, won, its, independence, from, spain, in, 1822, and, left, gran, colombia, in, 1830, gen, jos, de, villamil, the,

settlement, company, in, mid, 1831, and, with, president, juan, jos, flores, s, support, sent, col, ignacio, hern, ndez, with, a, dozen, craftsmen, to, begin, the, settlement, on, charles, island,

as, gal, pagos, day, or, the, day, of, the, province, darwin, s, birthday, was, the, same, day, as, was, francisco, de, orellana, s, arrival, at, the, headwaters, of, the, amazon, river, in, 1542, celebrated, on, the, mainland, as, amazon, day, villamil, arrived, in, september, and, established, haven, of, peace, asilo, de, paz, or, de, la, paz, in, the, island, s, highlands, the, initial, colonists, who, joined, him, were, ecuadorian, soldiers, chiefly, political, prisoners, whose, death, sentences, were, commuted, in, exchange, for, their, agreement, to, permanently, settle, the, islands, with, their, families, they, were, joined, in, october, by, additional, artisans, and, farmers, bringing, the, population, to, about, 120, at, which, point, villamil, was, formally, made, the, area, s, first, governor, villamil, s, lieutenant, governor, was, the, norwegian, born, american, and, chilean, sailor, and, shipwright, nicholas, oliver, lawson, haven, of, peace, was, originally, successful, and, peaceful, but, after, being, named, a, penal, colony, in, march, 1833, violence, and, costs, began, to, rise, villamil, was, faced, with, bankruptcy, by, 1837, and, resigned, his, post, founding, a, colony, of, 21, on, indefatigable, island, renamed, bolivia, and, leaving, lawson, as, its, mayor, gen, villamil, s, successors, incompetent, strict, or, both, prompted, a, bloody, uprising, in, 1841, that, caused, most, settlers, to, return, to, the, mainland, villamil, returned, to, try, to, rebuild, afterwards, but, was, unsuccessful, and, abandoned, the, attempt, in, 1848, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, under, captain, robert, fitzroy, was, undertaken, to, better, survey, the, coasts, and, harbours, of, south, america, for, the, british, navy, s, hydrographic, department, it, reached, the, gal, pagos, on, 15, september, 1835, and, while, surveying, its, islands, channels, and, bays, the, captain, and, others, on, the, crew, observed, the, geology, plants, and, wildlife, on, floreana, isabela, and, santiago, before, continuing, on, their, round, the, world, expedition, on, october, 20, the, young, naturalist, charles, darwin, primarily, a, geologist, at, the, time, was, struck, by, the, many, volcanic, features, they, saw, later, referring, to, the, archipelago, as, that, land, of, craters, his, study, of, several, volcanic, formations, over, the, five, weeks, he, stayed, in, the, islands, led, to, several, important, geological, discoveries, including, the, first, correct, explanation, for, how, volcanic, tuff, is, formed, darwin, noticed, the, mockingbirds, differed, between, islands, though, he, thought, the, birds, now, known, as, darwin, s, finches, were, unrelated, to, each, other, and, did, not, bother, labelling, them, by, island, acting, as, governor, of, the, islands, while, villamil, was, on, the, mainland, nicholas, lawson, met, darwin, and, the, british, crew, mentioning, in, passing, that, the, tortoises, of, the, different, islands, could, be, easily, identified, by, their, different, shells, by, the, end, of, his, voyage, darwin, was, beginning, to, wonder, if, the, distribution, of, the, mockingbirds, and, the, tortoises, might, undermine, the, stability, of, species, upon, his, return, to, england, analysis, of, the, bird, specimens, he, had, collected, showed, that, what, had, appeared, to, be, many, different, species, were, actually, finches, displaying, developments, unique, to, the, islands, the, voyage, became, crucial, in, darwin, s, development, of, his, theory, of, evolution, of, species, by, natural, selection, presented, in, the, 1859, on, the, origin, of, species, the, englishman, william, gurney, became, mayor, of, a, new, settlement, on, chatham, island,

valdiz, n, by, some, of, his, workers, cobos, brought, from, the, continent, to, san, crist, bal, island, a, group, of, more, than, a, hundred, workers, and, tried, his, luck, at, planting, sugar, cane, he, ruled, his, plantation, with, an, iron, hand, which, led, to, his, assassination, in, 1904, in, 1897, antonio, gil, began, another, plantation, on, isabela, island, over, the, course, of, a, whole, year, from, september, 1904, an, expedition, of, the, academy, of, sciences, of, california, led, by, rollo, beck, stayed, in, the, gal, pagos, collecting, scientific, material, on, geology, entomology, ornithology, botany, zoology, and, herpetology, another, expedition, from, that, academy, was, done, in, 1932, templeton, crocker, expedition, to, collect, insects, fish, shells, fossils, birds, and, plants, for, a, long, time, during, the, early, 1900s, and, at, least, through, 1929, a, cash, strapped, ecuador, had, reached, out, for, potential, buyers, of, the, islands, to, alleviate, financial, troubles, at, home, the, us, had, repeatedly, expressed, its, interest, in, buying, the, islands, for, military, use, as, they, were, positioned, strategically, guarding, the, panama, canal, besides, the, united, states, japan, germany, and, chile, also, expressed, interest, in, establishing, bases, in, the, islands, at, the, turn, of, the, century, chile, had, previously, acquired, the, straits, of, magellan, and, easter, island, for, strategic, reasons, and, lieutenant, gregorio, santa, cruz, argued, in, 1903, that, possessing, an, island, in, equatorial, waters, like, the, gal, pagos, would, be, of, great, benefit, since, the, geopolitical, situation, of, chile, was, expected, to, drastically, change, when, the, panama, canal, opened, another, benefit, would, be, to, widen, the, security, radius, of, chile, chile, was, alarmed, by, the, united, states, plans, to, establish, a, guantanamo, like, base, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, since, it, would, mean, that, chile, s, nitrate, rich, northern, provinces, would, be, within, the, range, of, united, states, navy, ecuador, s, staunch, resistance, to, a, us, purchase, or, bases, in, the, islands, can, be, credited, to, chilean, diplomacy, which, in, turn, was, informally, backed, on, this, issue, by, great, britain, and, germany, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, a, small, wave, of, european, settlers, arrived, in, the, islands, there, occurred, a, series, of, unsolved, disappearances, on, the, island, of, floreana, in, the, 1930s, among, the, largely, european, expatriate, residents, at, the, time, which, prompted, the, movies, the, empress, of, floreana, and, the, gal, pagos, affair, satan, came, to, eden, ecuadorian, laws, provided, all, colonists, with, the, possibility, of, receiving, twenty, hectares, each, of, free, land, the, right, to, maintain, their, citizenship, freedom, from, taxation, for, the, first, ten, years, in, gal, pagos, and, the, right, to, hunt, and, fish, freely, on, all, uninhabited, islands, where, they, might, settle, the, first, european, colonists, to, arrive, were, norwegians, who, settled, briefly, on, floreana, before, moving, on, to, san, cristobal, and, santa, cruz, a, few, years, later, other, colonists, from, europe, america, and, ecuador, started, arriving, on, the, islands, seeking, a, simpler, life, descendants, of, the,

expand, in, the, 1960s, imposing, several, restrictions, upon, the, human, population, already, living, on, the, island, however, opportunities, in, the, tourism, fishing, and, farming, industries, attracted, a, mass, of, poor, fishermen, and, farmers, from, mainland, ecuador, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, violent, confrontations, between, parts, of, the, local, population, and, the, gal, pagos,

april, 1969, soon, other, travel, companies, brought, in, tour, ships, and, yachts, and, local, fishermen, began, converting, their, wooden, boats, for, rudimentary, cruising, with, guests, these, vessels, were, the, main, source, of, overnight, accommodations, in, the, gal, pagos, today, there, are, about, 85, yachts, and, ships, equipped, for, overnight, guests, in, 2006, the, baltra, military, governed, island, was, opened, up, to, limited, overnight, camping, baltra, also, requires, permits, by, the, military, government, for, overnight, stays, on, the, beach, other, inhabited,

all, groups, are, accompanied, by, licensed, guides, though, the, first, protective, legislation, for, the, gal, pagos, was, enacted, in, 1930, and, supplemented, in, 1936, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1950s, that, positive, action, was, taken, to, control, what, was, happening, to, the, native, flora, and, fauna, in, 1955, the, international, union, for, the, conservation, of, nature, organized, a, fact, finding, mission, to, the, gal, pagos, two, years, later, in, 1957, unesco, in, cooperation, with, the, government, of, ecuador, sent, another, expedition, to, study, the, conservation, situation, and, choose, a, site, for, a, research, station, in, 1959, the, centenary, year, of, charles, darwin, s, publication, of, the, origin, of, species, the, ecuadorian, government, declared, 97, 5, of, the, archipelago, s, land, area, a, national, park, excepting, areas, already, colonised, the, charles, darwin, foundation, cdf, was, founded, the, same, year, the, core, responsibility, of, cdf, an, international, nongovernmental, organization, ngo, constituted, in, belgium, is, to, conduct, research, and, provide, the, research, findings, to, the, government, for, effective, management, of, gal, pagos, cdf, s, research, efforts, began, with, the, establishment, of, the, charles, darwin, research, station, on, santa, cruz, island, in, 1964, during, the, early, years, conservation, programs, such, as, eradication, of, introduced, species, and, protection, of, native, species, were, carried, out, by, research, station, personnel, now, much, of, that, work, is, accomplished, by, the, gal, pagos, national, park, service, using, the, research, findings, and, methodologies, developed, by, cdf, in, 1986, the, 70, 000, square, kilometers, 27, 000, sq, mi, of, ocean, surrounding, the, islands, was, declared, a, marine, reserve, second, in, size, only, to, australia, s, great, barrier, reef, in, 1990, the, archipelago, became, a, whale, sanctuary, unesco, recognized, the, islands, in, 1978, as, a, world, heritage, site, and, in, 1985, as, a, biosphere, reserve, this, was, later, extended, in, december, 2001, to, include, the, marine, reserve, in, july, 2010, the, world, heritage, committee, agreed, to, remove, the, gal, pagos, islands, from, its, list, of, precious, sites, endangered, by, environmental, threats, or, overuse, noteworthy, species, include, introduced, plants, and, animals, such, as, feral, goats, cats, and, cattle, brought, accidentally, or, willingly, to, the, islands, by, humans, represent, the, main, threat, to, gal, pagos, quick, to, reproduce, and, with, no, natural, predators, these, alien, species, decimated, the, habitats, of, native, species, the, native, animals, lacking, natural, predators, on, the, islands, are, defenseless, to, introduced, predators, there, are, over, 700, introduced, plant, species, today, there, are, only, 500, native, and, endemic, species, this, difference, is, creating, a, major, problem, for, the, islands, and, the, natural, species, that, inhabit, them, these, plants, have, invaded, large, areas, and, eliminated, endemic, species, in, the, humid, zones, of, san, cristobal, floreana, isabela, and, santa, cruz, some, of, the, most, harmful, introduced, plants, are, the, guayaba, or, guava, psidium, guajava, avocado, persea, americana, cascarilla, cinchona, pubescens, balsa, ochroma, pyramidale, hill, raspberry, rubus, niveus, various, citrus, orange, grapefruit, lemon, floripondio, higuerilla, ricinus, communis, trees, and, the, elephant, grass, pennisetum, purpureum, many, species, were, introduced, to, the, gal, pagos, by, pirates, thor, heyerdahl, quoted, documents, that, mention, the, viceroy, of, peru, knowing, that, british, pirates, ate, the, goats, that, they, themselves, had, released, in, the, islands, ordered, dogs, to, be, freed, there, to, eliminate, the, goats, also, when, colonization, of, floreana, by, jos, de, villamil, failed, he, ordered, the, goats, donkeys, cattle, and, other, animals, from, the, farms, in, floreana, be, transferred, to, other, islands, for, the, purpose, of, later, colonization, non, native, goats, pigs, dogs, rats, cats, mice, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, poultry, ants, cockroaches, and, some, parasites, inhabit, the, islands, today, dogs, and, cats, attack, the, tame, birds, and, destroy, the, nests, of, birds, land, tortoises, and, marine, turtles, they, sometimes, kill, small, gal, pagos, tortoises, and, iguanas, pigs, are, even, more, harmful, covering, larger, areas, and, destroying, the, nests, of, tortoises, turtles, and, iguanas, as, well, as, eating, the, animals, native, food, pigs, also, knock, down, vegetation, in, their, search, for, roots, and, insects, this, problem, abounds, in, cerro, azul, volcano, and, isabela, and, in, santiago, pigs, may, be, the, cause, of, the, disappearance, of, the, land, iguanas, that, were, so, abundant, when, darwin, visited, the, black, rat, rattus, rattus, attacks, small, gal, pagos, tortoises, when, they, leave, the, nest, so, in, pinz, n, they, stopped, the, reproduction, for, a, period, of, more, than, 50, years, only, adults, were, found, on, that, island, also, where, the, black, rat, is, found, the, endemic, rat, has, disappeared, cattle, and, donkeys, eat, all, the, available, vegetation, and, compete, with, native, species, for, scarce, water, in, 1959, fishermen, introduced, one, male, and, two, female, goats, to, pinta, island, by, 1973, the, national, park, service, estimated, the, population, of, goats, to, be, over, 30, 000, individuals, goats, were, also, introduced, to, marchena, in, 1967, and, to, rabida, in, 1971, a, goat, eradication, program, however, cleared, the, goats, from, pinta, and, santiago, and, most, of, the, goat, population, from, isabela, and, by, 2006, all, feral, pigs, donkeys, and, non, sterile, goats, had, been, eliminated, from, santiago, and, isabela, the, largest, islands, with, the, worst, problems, due, to, non, native, mammals, six, species, of, small, non, native, vertebrates, have, established, self, sufficient, populations, in, gal, pagos, and,

sufficient, populations, but, evidence, is, unclear, the, fast, growing, poultry, industry, on, the, inhabited, islands, has, been, cause, for, concern, from, local, conservationists, who, fear, domestic, birds, could, introduce, disease, into, the, endemic, wild, bird, populations, the, gal, pagos, marine, sanctuary, is, under, threat, from, a, host, of, illegal, fishing, activities, in, addition, to, other, problems, of, development, the, most, pressing, threat, to, the, marine, reserve, comes, from, local, mainland, and, foreign, fishing, targeting, marine, life, illegally, within,

in, danger, because, of, threats, posed, by, invasive, species, unbridled, tourism, and, overfishing, on, 29, july, 2010, the, world, heritage, committee, decided, to, remove, the, gal, pagos, islands, from, the, list, because, the, committee, found, significant, progress, had, been, made, by, ecuador, in, addressing, these, problems, on, 28, january, 2008, gal, pagos, national, park,
