most, of, the, 17th, century, spanish, ships, were, menaced, by, pirates, so, they, developed, a, complex, system, where, ships, with, military, protection, were, dispatched, to, central, america, in, a, convoy, from, seville, the, only, port, allowed, to, trade, with, the, american, colonies, to, lima, peru, and, from, there, to, the, other, cities, of, the, viceroyalty, because, of, this, products, took, a, very, long, time, to, arrive, in, buenos, aires, and, the, taxes, generated, by, the, transport, made, them, prohibitive, this, scheme, frustrated, the, traders, of, buenos, aires, and, a, thriving, informal, yet, tolerated, by, the, authorities, contraband, industry, developed, inside, the, viceroyalties, and, with, the, portuguese, this, also, instilled, a, deep, resentment, among, porte, os, towards, the, spanish, authorities, sensing, these, feelings, charles, iii, of, spain, progressively, eased, the, trade, restrictions, before, finally, declaring, buenos, aires, an, open, port, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, capture, of, portobelo, in, panama, by, british, forces, also, fueled, the, need, to, foster, commerce, via, the, atlantic, route, to, the, detriment, of, lima, based, trade, one, of, his, rulings, was, to, split, a, region, from, the, viceroyalty, of, per, and, create, instead, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, with, buenos, aires, as, the, capital, however, charles, s, placating, actions, did, not, have, the, desired, effect, and, the, porte, os, some, of, them, versed, in, the, ideology, of, the, french, revolution, instead, became, even, more, convinced, of, the, need, for, independence, from, spain, during, the, british, invasions, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, british, forces, attacked, buenos, aires, twice, in, 1806, the, british, successfully, invaded, buenos, aires, but, an, army, from, montevideo, led, by, santiago, de, liniers, defeated, them, in, the, brief, period, of, british, rule, the, viceroy, rafael,

could, not, resume, his, duties, as, viceroy, santiago, de, liniers, chosen, as, new, viceroy, prepared, the, city, against, a, possible, new, british, attack, and, repelled, a, second, invasion, by, britain, in, 1807, the, militarization, generated, in, society, changed, the, balance, of, power, favorably, for, the, criollos, in, contrast, to, peninsulars, as, well, as, the, development, of, the, peninsular, war, in, spain, an, attempt, by, the, peninsular, merchant, mart, n, de, lzaga, to, remove, liniers, and, replace, him, with, a, junta, was, defeated, by, the, criollo, armies, however, by, 1810, it, would, be, those, same, armies, who, would, support, a, new, revolutionary, attempt, successfully, removing, the, new, viceroy, baltasar, hidalgo, de, cisneros, this, is, known, as, the, may, revolution, which, is, now, celebrated, as, a, national, holiday, this, event, started, the, argentine, war, of, independence, and, many, armies, left, buenos, aires, to, fight, the, diverse, strongholds, of, royalist, resistance, with, varying, levels, of, success, the, government, was, held, first, by, two, juntas, of, many, members, then, by, two, triumvirates, and, finally, by, a, unipersonal, office, the, supreme, director, formal, independence, from, spain, was, declared, in, 1816, at, the, congress, of, tucum, n, buenos, aires, managed, to, endure, the, whole, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, without, falling, again, under, royalist, rule, historically, buenos, aires, has, been, argentina, s, main, venue, of, liberal, free, trading, and, foreign, ideas, in, contrast, many, of, the, provinces, especially, those, to, the, city, s, northwest, advocated, a, more, nationalistic, and, catholic, approach, to, political, and, social, issues, in, fact, much, of, the, internal, tension, in, argentina, s, history, starting, with, the, centralist, federalist, conflicts, of, the, 19th, century, can, be, traced, back, to, these, contrasting, views, in, the, months, immediately, following, said, may, revolution, buenos, aires, sent, a, number, of, military, envoys, to, the, provinces, with, the, intention, of, obtaining, their, approval, instead, the, enterprise, fueled, tensions, between, the, capital, and, the, provinces, many, of, these, missions, ended, in, violent, clashes, in, the, 19th, century, the, city, was, blockaded, twice, by, naval, forces, by, the, french, from, 1838, to, 1840, and, later, by, an, anglo, french, expedition, from, 1845, to, 1848, both, blockades, failed, to, bring, the, argentine, government, to, the, negotiating, table, and, the, foreign, powers, eventually, desisted, from, their, demands, during, most, of, the, 19th, century, the, political, status, of, the, city, remained, a, sensitive, subject, it, was, already, the, capital, of, buenos, aires, province, and, between, 1853, and, 1860, it, was, the, capital, of, the, seceded, state, of, buenos, aires, the, issue, was, fought, out, more, than, once, on, the, battlefield, until, the, matter, was, finally, settled, in, 1880, when, the, city, was, federalized, and, became, the, seat, of, government, with, its, mayor, appointed, by, the, president, the, casa, rosada, became, the, seat, of, the, president, health, conditions, in, poor, areas, were, appalling, with, high, rates, of, tuberculosis, contemporaneous, public, health, physicians, and, politicians, typically, blamed, both, the, poor, themselves, and, their, ramshackle, tenement, houses, conventillos, for, the, spread, of, the, dreaded, disease, people, ignored, public, health, campaigns, to, limit, the, spread, of, contagious, diseases, such, as, the, prohibition, of, spitting, on, the, streets, the, strict, guidelines, to, care, for, infants, and, young, children, and, quarantines, that, separated, families, from, ill, loved, ones, in, addition, to, the, wealth, generated, by, customs, duties, and, argentine, foreign, trade, in, general, as, well, as, the, existence, of, fertile, pampas, railroad, development, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, increased, the, economic, power, of, buenos, aires, as, raw, materials, flowed, into, its, factories, a, leading, destination, for, immigrants, from, europe, particularly, italy, and, spain, from, 1880, to, 1930, buenos, aires, became, a, multicultural, city, that, ranked, itself,
