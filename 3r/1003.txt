century, d, l, k, became, one, of, aintab, s, dependencies, according, to, geographer, yaqut, al, hamawi, in, the, next, century, aintab, was, the, capital, of, its, district, and, a, town, with, fine, markets, much, frequented, by, merchants, and, travellers, while, duluk, was, in, ruins, according, to, abulfeda, still, aintab, continued, to, be, hotly, contested, throughout, these, centuries, 22, 3, it, was, besieged, by, the, mongols, in, 1270, 23, it, repeatedly, changed, hands, between, the, ilkhanate, and, the, mamluk, sultanate, or, the, dulkadirids, a, turkoman, vassal, state, of, the, mamluks, gaziantep, was, near, the, southern, frontier, of, the, dulkadir, emirate, and, on, several, occasions, it, slipped, out, of, their, control, 23, the, ilkhans, ruled, over, it, between, 1260, and, 1261, 1271, 1272, 1280, 1281, and, 1299, 1317, the, mamluks, controlled, the, city, between, 1261, and, 1271, 1272, 1280, 1281, 1299, 1317, 1341, 1353, 1378, 1381, 1389, it, was, unsuccessfully, besieged, by, the, dulkadir, leader, sevli, beg, in, 1390, although, the, mamluks, and, their, dulkadirid, vassals, could, control, the, city, from, 1395, until, the, ottoman, conquest, in, 1516, the, city, was, besieged, by, timur, in, 1400, and, then, in, 1420, by, the, ak, koyunlu, leader, kara, yusuf, 23, these, attacks, all, caused, destruction, and, suffering, among, the, local, population, but, at, the, same, time, the, city, was, acquiring, a, reputation, as, a, cultured, urban, center, badr, al, din, al, ayni, an, aintab, native, who, became, a, successful, diplomat, judge, and, historian, under, the, mamluks, wrote, at, the, end, of, the, 1300s, that, the, city, was, called, little, bukhara, because, so, many, scholars, came, to, study, there, ayni, also, left, a, firsthand, account, of, the, suffering, caused, during, sevli, beg, s, siege, in, 1390, 23, another, rough, patch, for, aintab, s, people, came, in, the, late, 1460s, when, the, dulkadir, prince, ehsuvar, rebelled, against, the, mamluks, 25, mamluk, forces, captured, aintab, in, may, 1468, driving, out, ehsuvar, s, forces, a, report, by, the, governor, of, aleppo, indicates, that, resistance, had, been, fierce, just, a, month, later, ehsuvar, recaptured, aintab, after, four, engagements, with, mamluk, forces, after, ehsuvar, s, final, defeat, and, public, execution, by, the, mamluks, in, 1473, gaziantep, enjoyed, a, period, of, relative, peace, and, stability, under, his, brother, and, successor, ala, ddevle, ala, ddevle, appears, to, have, considered, gaziantep, an, important, possession, and, commissioned, several, constructions, in, the, city, including, a, reservoir, and, a, large, mosque, in, the, middle, of, town, the, city, s, fortress, was, also, renovated, completed, in, 1481, these, repairs, were, likely, ordered, by, the, mamluk, sultan, qaitbay, during, his, tour, of, northern, syria, in, 1477, his, name, is, inscribed, above, the, entrance, portal, perhaps, symbolically, marking, his, territory, 26, the, end, of, the, dulkadir, principality, came, around, 1515, ala, ddevle, refused, to, fight, alongside, the, ottomans, at, the, battle, of, chaldiran, in, 1514, the, ottomans, used, this, as, a, pretext, to, overthrow, him, and, in, june, 1515, he, was, executed, 24, as, ala, ddevle, had, been, a, mamluk, vassal, the, mamluks, considered, this, an, affront, and, the, mamluk, sultan, qansuh, al, ghawri, mobilized, an, army, and, marched, north, towards, aleppo, 25, the, conflict, over, the, region, meant, that, in, gaziantep, anxieties, about, the, fate, of, the, city, and, its, surroundings, must, have, been, high, later, court, records, from, the, early, 1540s, provide, documentary, evidence, of, dislocation, and, loss, of, population, as, people, fled, this, may, have, been, more, pronounced, in, rural, areas, than, in, the, city, itself, 30, the, ottoman, empire, captured, gaziantep, just, before, the, battle, of, marj, dabiq, in, 1516, under, the, reign, of, sultan, selim, i, in, the, ottoman, period, aintab, was, a, sanjak, centred, initially, in, the, dulkadir, eyalet, 1516, 1818, and, later, in, the, aleppo, vilayet, 1908, 1918, it, was, also, a, kaza, in, the, aleppo, vilayet, 1818, 1908, the, city, established, itself, as, a, centre, for, commerce, due, to, its, location, straddling, trade, routes, although, it, was, controlled, by, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, only, between, 1155, 1157, and, 1204, 1206, for, most, of, the, last, two, millennia, gaziantep, hosted, a, large, armenian, community, armenians, played, a, significant, role, in, the, city, s, history, culture, welfare, and, prosperity, these, communities, no, longer, exist, in, the, city, due, to, the, hamidian, massacres, in, 1895, and, the, armenian, genocide, in, 1915, gaziantep, served, a, significant, trade, route, within, the, ottoman, empire, armenians, were, active, in, manufacturing, agriculture, production, and, most, notably, trade, and, became, the, wealthiest, ethnic, group, in, the, city, until, their, wealth, was, confiscated, during, the, armenian, genocide, at, the, beginning, of, his, campaign, against, the, mamluks, in, 1516, the, ottoman, sultan, selim, i, brought, his, army, to, gaziantep, en, route, to, syria, the, city, s, mamluk, governor, yunus, beg, submitted, to, selim, without, a, fight, and, gave, him, the, keys, to, the, castle, on, 20, august, 26, the, next, day, 21, august, selim, set, up, camp, outside, the, city, with, great, majesty, and, pomp, and, held, meetings, with, local, military, commanders, to, discuss, strategy, for, the, upcoming, battle, 26, 7, the, fateful, battle, of, marj, dabiq, took, place, just, days, later, on, 24, august, gaziantep, although, not, an, active, battle, site, thus, played, a, strategic, role, in, the, ottoman, conquest, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, 27, the, ottoman, victory, at, marj, dabiq, had, profound, consequences, for, gaziantep, although, its, inhabitants, had, no, way, of, knowing, at, the, time, for, the, first, time, in, almost, 1, 000, years, gaziantep, was, located, in, the, middle, of, an, empire, rather, than, a, contested, border, region, it, lost, its, strategic, importance, but, also, its, vulnerability, to, attack, for, four, centuries, until, the, french, occupation, in, 1921, gaziantep, was, relatively, peaceful, 27, in, the, short, term, though, gaziantep, was, still, reeling, from, the, instability, before, and, after, the, ottoman, conquest, 28, 9, during, that, period, gaziantep, had, suffered, from, depredation, as, well, as, fear, caused, by, political, uncertainty, 29, besides, political, conflict, the, city, s, economic, slump, at, this, time, can, also, be, partly, attributed, to, a, general, decline, in, commerce, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, region, that, caused, a, general, economic, downturn, in, the, region, in, the, early, 1500s, 31, 2, only, around, the, 1530s, when, the, ottoman, authorities, turned, their, attention, to, the, territories, recently, conquered, from, dulkadir, do, cadastral, records, indicate, renewed, prosperity, in, gaziantep, 28, 30, 1, an, important, event, was, s, leyman, the, magnificent, s, successful, mesopotamian, campaign, against, safavid, iran, in, 1534, 36, which, took, baghdad, and, increased, the, security, of, trade, routes, in, gaziantep, s, region, 31, as, with, the, earlier, economic, downturn, the, renewed, prosperity, in, gaziantep, in, the, 1530s, was, part, of, a, broader, regional, pattern, of, economic, growth, during, this, period, 32, as, a, disclaimer, some, of, this, apparent, economic, growth, may, be, an, artifact, of, using, tax, documents, as, a, source, tax, assessors, may, have, simply, been, doing, more, accurate, counts, in, later, surveys, or, the, government, might, have, been, applying, more, strict, scrutiny, as, their, control, increased, 32, part, of, this, was, deliberate, the, ottomans, had, a, policy, of, lowering, taxes, in, recently, conquered, territories, both, to, placate, locals, and, to, provide, an, economic, stimulus, to, help, war, torn, areas, recover, 32, 3, later, as, their, control, solidified, the, authorities, would, raise, taxes, again, according, to, leslie, peirce, this, seems, to, have, been, the, case, in, gaziantep, tax, rates, in, 1536, were, significantly, lower, than, the, rates, in, 1520, which, she, assumes, were, the, pre, ottoman, rates, the, rates, went, up, again, in, the, 1543, survey, which, she, interprets, as, the, ottomans, raising, taxes, again, in, the, meantime, 33, the, dulkadir, emirate, did, not, simply, go, away, immediately, after, the, ottoman, victory, at, marj, dabiq, it, stuck, around, as, an, ottoman, vassal, until, 1522, when, the, last, dulkadir, ruler, resisted, discipline, by, the, ottoman, administration, the, ottomans, had, him, executed, and, officially, dismantled, the, dulkadir, principality, annexing, its, territories, to, the, empire, to, form, the, beglerbeglik, of, dulkadir, 25, despite, being, part, of, the, former, dulkadir, territories, though, the, sanjak, of, gaziantep, was, initially, put, under, the, beglerbeglik, of, aleppo, instead, of, dulkadir, this, indicates, how, just, as, in, the, mamluk, period, gaziantep, was, then, seen, more, as, part, of, northern, syria, than, as, part, of, anatolia, the, area, was, culturally, mixed, and, many, locals, were, bilingual, in, turkish, and, arabic, as, well, as, other, languages, gaziantep, s, cultural, and, economic, ties, were, mostly, with, aleppo, which, was, a, major, international, center, of, trade, 27, at, some, point, in, the, 1530s, gaziantep, was, moved, into, the, beglerbeglik, of, dulkadir, whose, capital, was, mara, even, though, it, was, now, administratively, part, of, dulkadir, gaziantep, remained, commercially, more, connected, to, aleppo, 27, the, 17th, century, turkish, traveller, evliya, elebi, noted, it, had, 3, 900, shops, and, two, bedesten, s, in, 1818, gaziantep, was, moved, back, into, the, aleppo, province, 27, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, aintab, had, a, population, of, about, 45, 000, two, thirds, of, whom, were, muslim, largely, turkish, but, also, partially, arab, a, large, community, of, christians, lived, in, the, armenian, community, in, the, 19th, century, considerable, american, protestant, christian, missionary, activity, occurred, in, aintab, in, particular, central, turkey, college, was, founded, in, 1874, by, the, american, mission, board, and, largely, served, the, armenian, community, the, armenians, were, systemically, slaughtered, during, the, hamidian, massacres, in, 1895, and, later, the, armenian, genocide, in, 1915, consequently, the, central, turkey, college, was, transferred, to, aleppo, in, 1916, after, the, first, world, war, and, armistice, of, mudros, gaziantep, was, occupied, by, the, united, kingdom, on, 17, december, 1918, and, it, was, transferred, to, france, on, 5, november, 1919, the, french, armenian, legion, was, also, involved, in, occupation, in, april, 1920, irregular, turkish, troops, known, as, kuva, yi, milliye, besieged, the, city, but, the, 10, month, long, battle, resulted, in, french, victory, around, 6, 000, turkish, civilians, were, killed, in, the, process, the, french, made, the, last, attempt, to, revive, the, armenian, community, in, the, city, during, the, siege, of, aintab, where, the, armenians, who, fled, the, genocide, were, promised, their, homes, back, in, their, native, lands, however, on, 25, december, 1921, the, treaty, of, ankara, was, signed, and, as, a, result, the, french, evacuated, the, city, according, to, mit, kurt, born, in, modern, day, gaziantep, and, an, academic, at, harvard, s, center, for, middle, east, studies, the, famous, battle, of, aintab, against, the, french, seems, to, have, been, as, much, the, organised, struggle, of, a, group, of, genocide, profiteers, seeking, to, hold, onto, their, loot, as, it, was, a, fight, against, an, occupying, force, the, resistance, sought, to, make, it, impossible, for, the, armenian, repatriates, to, remain, in, their, native, towns, terrorising, them, to, make, them, flee, in, short, not, only, did, the, local, landowners, industrialists, and, civil, military, bureaucratic, elites, lead, to, the, resistance, movement, but, they, also, financed, it, to, cleanse, aintab, of, armenians, the, same, turkish, families, who, made, their, wealth, through, the, expropriation, of, armenians, in, 1915, and, 1921, 1922, continued, to, dominate, the, city, s, politics, through, the, one, party, period, of, the, republic, of,

according, to, kuyucu, and, zer, though, the, resulting, maps, and, plans, are, unavailable, 64, another, early, city, plan, for, gaziantep, was, drawn, up, by, barsumyan, and, nazaryan, in, the, early, 1920s, during, the, turkish, war, of, independence, 197, 11, the, barsumyan, nazaryan, plan, included, an, airport, for, the, city, but, omitted, any, railway, connections, 197, during, this, period, because, the, jewish, and, armenian, communities, had, left, the, city, during, the, war, period, the, city, did, not, expand, into, new, areas, instead, now, vacant, neighborhoods, were, used, to, meet, new, demand, 64, in, the, first, years, of, the, republic, of, turkey, new, city, planning, laws, were, enacted, requiring, all, major, cities, to, have, development, plans, 64, in, 1938, the, gaziantep, municipality, requested, that, hermann, jansen, draw, up, a, plan, for, the, city, 200, 199, 200, the, resulting, jansen, plan, was, the, first, large, scale, city, planning, initiative, in, gaziantep, and, many, of, its, proposals, were, ultimately, put, into, action, 67, the, jansen, plan, sought, to, preserve, the, existing, urban, character, of, gaziantep, while, also, planning, new, areas, outside, the, traditional, core, 64, it, mainly, focused, on, new, development, on, the, north, south, and, west, sides, of, the, city, 200, new, industrial, zones, were, drawn, up, along, important, transportation, arteries, particularly, the, nizip, and, aleppo, roads, 200, the, most, important, was, a, 33, hectare, industrial, zone, on, the, north, side, of, town, which, was, to, be, connected, to, the, railway, network, 200, the, new, industrial, area, was, specifically, chosen, to, be, on, the, northeast, because, the, prevailing, wind, direction, is, from, the, northwest, so, this, way, air, pollution, would, not, be, blown, over, the, city, 66, the, plan, introduced, several, important, changes, to, the, city, s, transportation, network, 64, one, of, the, most, important, was, the, addition, of, a, rail, line, to, connect, gaziantep, to, the, national, rail, system, 64, up, to, now, turkish, railway, construction, had, ignored, gaziantep, partly, because, of, its, mountainous, surroundings, a, national, railway, plan, also, introduced, in, 1938, left, gaziantep, unconnected, to, the, rail, network, 198, 9, the, jansen, plan, represented, the, first, major, proposal, to, construct, a, railway, to, gaziantep, 200, jansen, wanted, to, put, the, train, station, on, the, north, side, of, the, city, for, multiple, reasons, 64, 5, first, because, the, topography, on, the, north, side, is, flatter, and, second, because, putting, a, railway, on, the, south, side, would, separate, the, old, town, from, the, new, planned, residential, areas, further, south, which, jansen, wanted, to, avoid, 65, jansen, also, planned, significant, changes, to, the, city, s, streets, opening, up, several, new, boulevards, and, widening, pre, existing, streets, to, help, make, a, continuous, transportation, network, 65, he, proposed, combining, the, narl, and, aleppo, roads, into, smet, n, n, caddesi, which, was, to, be, the, main, transportation, axis, of, the, city, 65, the, existing, commercial, axis, along, the, aleppo, road, lined, with, hans, and, marketplaces, was, to, be, expanded, with, new, commercial, buildings, along, the, new, n, n, cd, 65, 6, the, plan, also, sought, to, create, a, sw, ne, axis, connecting, the, kilis, and, nizip, roads, by, way, of, stasyon, caddesi, in, the, north, and, atat, rk, caddesi, in, the, west, this, axis, would, also, be, connected, to, n, n, cd, 65, two, important, pre, existing, streets, in, the, old, town, suburcu, cd, and, eski, saray, cd, would, also, be, expanded, and, connected, with, these, other, streets, 65, finally, besides, road, and, rail, jansen, also, proposed, the, construction, of, an, airport, on, the, west, side, of, town, 65, one, of, the, most, important, features, of, the, jansen, plan, was, the, designation, of, a, green, belt, along, alleben, creek, running, east, west, across, the, entire, city, where, no, construction, was, to, take, place, 66, this, would, provide, a, large, open, recreational, area, 66, jansen, also, proposed, a, large, area, to, the, north, of, the, creek, to, be, used, for, sports, fields, and, a, hippodrome, although, these, were, never, built, 66, the, jansen, plan, zoned, for, new, residential, areas, to, the, south, of, the, old, city, 65, this, may, have, been, done, to, follow, the, pre, existing, main, axis, along, the, southbound, aleppo, road, 65, it, may, have, also, been, because, jansen, wanted, the, existing, houses, of, the, old, city, to, be, visible, from, the, south, 65, he, wanted, to, build, new, residential, areas, in, a, similar, fashion, with, two, story, houses, arranged, on, parallel, streets, that, followed, the, slope, of, hills, 65, in, order, to, provide, space, for, the, southward, residential, expansion, jansen, proposed, that, the, pre, existing, cemetery, on, the, south, side, of, town, be, moved, to, a, new, planned, location, in, the, northeast, 65, 6, to, the, northwest, of, the, old, city, jansen, wanted, to, build, one, story, houses, among, vineyards, in, a, low, density, agricultural, area, 65, the, proposed, workers, quarter, in, the, northeast, near, the, planned, industrial, zone, was, to, follow, a, similar, plan, with, low, cost, single, story, houses, 65, for, the, city, s, new, administrative, buildings, jansen, chose, to, develop, the, ukurbostan, area, located, in, the, old, city, center, but, with, some, vacant, space, available, 66, in, a, departure, from, his, typical, policy, of, not, modifying, the, old, urban, fabric, also, proposed, demolishing, some, existing, buildings, and, altering, the, pre, existing, street, layout, to, accommodate, this, new, construction, 66, many, elements, of, the, jansen, plan, were, ultimately, put, into, action, and, it, had, a, significant, influence, on, how, gaziantep, was, built, during, the, 20th, century, 66, it, especially, shaped, the, city, s, transport, network, the, construction, of, a, rail, line, on, the, north, side, the, opening, of, new, transportation, axes, such, as, n, n, cd, and, the, expansion, of, existing, roads, were, all, realized, 66, the, expansion, of, commercial, areas, along, the, old, aleppo, road, led, to, the, development, of, n, n, cd, as, one, of, the, city, s, main, commercial, axes, a, role, it, still, plays, today, 66, the, airport, area, he, proposed, however, was, never, built, in, the, 1950s, as, urbanization, and, population, growth, created, new, demand, the, area, was, turned, into, a, residential, zone, instead, 66, the, planned, residential, expansion, to, the, south, did, take, place, as, did, the, proposed, relocation, of, the, cemetery, to, the, northeast, but, ultimately, the, main, direction, of, residential, expansion, shifted, to, the, northwest, instead, 66, this, is, partly, because, the, hilly, area, to, the, south, is, less, conducive, for, construction, 67, the, industrial, zone, on, the, northeast, was, built, but, the, adjacent, workers, quarter, never, materialized, 66, although, the, recreational, areas, to, the, north, were, never, built, the, alleben, green, belt, became, an, important, green, space, in, the, city, and, it, remains, to, this, day, although, some, of, it, has, since, been, turned, over, for, new, construction, 66, jansen, s, recommendation, of, low, rise, development, also, succeeded, at, preserving, the, silhouette, of, the, city, until, the, 1970s, 66, one, failing, of, the, jansen, plan, was, that, it, significantly, underestimated, the, population, growth, of, the, city, during, the, next, 50, years, particularly, after, 1945, 66, this, lack, led, to, the, growth, of, uncontrolled, unplanned, settlements, in, the, city, 67, in, addition, jansen, s, general, non, intervention, policy, with, the, old, city, center, proved, insufficient, to, maintain, its, character, in, the, absence, of, managed, oversight, many, old, buildings, ended, up, deteriorating, ultimately, getting, demolished, and, then, being, replaced, with, new, structures, that, architecturally, did, not, blend, in, 67, by, the, 1950s, gaziantep, s, rapid, growth, was, outpacing, the, jansen, plan, s, limits, resulting, in, the, creation, of, unplanned, settlements, such, as, kar, yaka, in, the, north, and, d, ztepe, in, the, south, and, prompting, the, creation, of, a, new, city, plan, 556, this, plan, drawn, up, by, kemal, ahmet, aru, and, hamit, kemali, s, ylemezo, lu, in, 1955, continued, the, basic, principles, of, the, jansen, plan, while, adding, some, revisions, 556, the, city, s, shape, remained, compact, and, focused, around, a, single, center, which, was, now, being, extended, towards, the, south, and, west, 556, 7, the, main, goal, of, the, aru, s, ylemezo, lu, plan, was, to, provide, new, housing, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, growing, urban, population, 560, there, was, also, an, effort, to, shift, from, agriculturally, oriented, economy, to, industrial, 560, among, the, important, features, introduced, in, the, aru, s, ylemezo, lu, plan, were, the, railway, station, now, in, its, current, location, and, the, addition, of, the, new, pek, yolu, highway, as, a, northwards, continuation, of, stasyon, cd, 556, the, new, planned, upscale, residential, neighborhoods, of, bah, elievler, kavakl, k, and, retmenevleri, signalled, a, shift, towards, building, new, neighborhoods, to, the, southwest, 556, ordu, cd, a, westward, extension, of, atat, rk, cd, was, opened, up, and, the, kilis, aleppo, axis, shifted, to, this, route, 556, 7, in, general, the, aru, s, ylemezo, lu, plan, planned, a, grid, plan, for, the, city, s, streets, 10, the, area, north, of, alleben, creek, which, under, the, jansen, plan, had, been, designated, as, recreational, areas, were, converted, into, residential, development, under, aru, s, ylemezo, lu, plan, 557, several, small, new, industrial, areas, were, also, developed, around, nizip, cd, araban, yolu, and, pek, yolu, 556, in, 1973, a, competition, was, organized, under, the, supervision, of, ller, bank, to, draft, a, third, city, zoning, plan, for, gaziantep, it, was, held, simultaneously, with, ones, in, konya, and, kayseri, 557, the, gaziantep, contest, was, won, by, a, team, led, by, z, ht, can, and, also, including, yal, n, alaybeyo, lu, abdullah, dellalo, lu, m, zeyyen, can, and, haluk, aral, 557, the, resulting, can, plan, consisted, of, several, stages, guiding, the, city, s, development, until, a, target, year, of, 1995, when, they, projected, a, population, of, 1, million, for, gaziantep, 557, the, can, plan, focused, on, developing, gaziantep, as, an, industrial, center, with, an, increasing, share, of, land, dedicated, to, industrial, use, 557, these, industrial, areas, were, also, increasingly, set, apart, from, residential, areas, 561, the, can, plan, envisioned, a, three, pole, city, with, industrial, areas, at, the, west, and, east, ends, and, new, residential, development, in, the, south, 557, gaziantep, s, organized, industrial, zone, had, been, established, in, 1969, and, was, one, of, the, first, in, turkey, 558, by, 1978, manufacturing, had, reached, 11, 6, of, gaziantep, s, gdp, 561, compared, to, about, 17, for, the, country, as, a, whole, the, 1970s, were, gaziantep, s, highest, period, of, immigration, 558, new, residential, development, during, this, period, was, clustered, into, two, main, areas, 558, the, first, area, was, neighborhoods, on, the, south, and, east, sides, of, town, like, kar, yaka, d, ztepe, and, ksorut, where, many, manufacturing, jobs, were, available, 558, the, second, consisted, of, areas, on, the, north, and, west, where, relatively, higher, income, people, who, worked, in, the, service, sector, lived, 558, the, patterns, for, urban, development, differed, between, these, two, areas, 558, in, the, south, and, east, there, was, an, irregular, settlement, pattern, formed, by, purchasing, land, around, factories, 558, in, the, north, and, west, there, was, a, regular, grid, of, wide, streets, lined, with, houses, and, apartment, complexes, 558, beginning, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, can, plan, was, undermined, by, illegal, building, and, zoning, amnesties, which, disrupted, the, plan, s, form, and, caused, the, city, to, grow, in, unplanned, ways, 558, the, municipal, government, tried, to, address, the, situation, by, performing, piecemeal, interventions, to, rehabilitate, these, areas, but, ultimately, the, effect, was, that, poorly, integrated, pockets, of, the, city, were, formed, 558, the, problem, of, illegal, construction, in, the, late, 80s, combined, with, the, introduction, of, the, metropolitan, municipality, law, and, changes, to, national, zoning, regulations, such, as, zoning, law, 3194, both, giving, cities, increased, authority, in, urban, planning, as, opposed, to, the, central, government, necessitated, an,

predicted, population, of, about, 1, 8, million, 558, it, planned, for, the, city, to, expand, to, 8010, ha, of, which, 26, would, be, residential, 22, would, be, industrial, and, 17, would, be, open, green, spaces, 558, the, aldan, plan, followed, a, metropolitan, polycentric, model, with, new, commercial, zones, mixed, in, with, the, residential, areas, to, serve, as, secondary, urban, centers, 558, the, main, directions, for, new, development, were, toward, the, west, and, south, 558, a, new, ring, road, on, the, east, south, and, west, helped, boost, growth, in, these, directions, 558, some, of, the, new, secondary, centers, were, built, in, the, karata, and, brahimli, areas, 559, another, major, addition, was, a, new, commercial, area, on, the, east, side, of, the, city, called,
