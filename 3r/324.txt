the, iberian, peninsula, ipa, a, b, r, i, n, also, known, as, iberia, is, a, peninsula, in, south, western, europe, defining, the, westernmost, edge, of, eurasia, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, european, landmass, by, the, pyrenees, it, includes, the, territories, of, peninsular, spain, and, continental, portugal, comprising, most, of, the, region, as, well, as, the, tiny, adjuncts, of, andorra, the, british, overseas, territory, of, gibraltar, and, pursuant, to, the, traditional, definition, of, the, pyrenees, as, the, peninsula, s, northeastern, boundary, a, small, part, of, france, with, an, area, of, approximately, 583, 254, square, kilometres, 225, 196, sq, mi, and, a, population, of, roughly, 53, million, it, is, the, second, largest, european, peninsula, by, area, after, the, scandinavian, peninsula, the, iberian, peninsula, has, always, been, associated, with, the, river, ebro, ib, ros, in, ancient, greek, and, ib, rus, or, hib, rus, in, latin, the, association, was, so, well, known, it, was, hardly, necessary, to, state, for, example, ib, ria, was, the, country, this, side, of, the, ib, rus, in, strabo, pliny, goes, so, far, as, to, assert, that, the, greeks, had, called, the, whole, of, spain, hiberia, because, of, the, hiberus, river, the, river, appears, in, the, ebro, treaty, of, 226, bce, between, rome, and, carthage, setting, the, limit, of, carthaginian, interest, at, the, ebro, the, fullest, description, of, the, treaty, stated, in, appian, uses, ib, rus, with, reference, to, this, border, polybius, states, that, the, native, name, is, ib, r, apparently, the, original, word, stripped, of, its, greek, or, latin, os, or, us, termination, the, early, range, of, these, natives, which, geographers, and, historians, place, from, the, present, southern, spain, to, the, present, southern, france, along, the, mediterranean, coast, is, marked, by, instances, of, a, readable, script, expressing, a, yet, unknown, language, dubbed, iberian, whether, this, was, the, native, name, or, was, given, to, them, by, the, greeks, for, their, residence, near, the, ebro, remains, unknown, credence, in, polybius, imposes, certain, limitations, on, etymologizing, if, the, language, remains, unknown, the, meanings, of, the, words, including, iber, must, also, remain, unknown, in, modern, basque, the, word, ibar, means, valley, or, watered, meadow, while, ibai, means, river, but, there, is, no, proof, relating, the, etymology, of, the, ebro, river, with, these, basque, names, the, word, iberia, is, a, noun, adapted, from, the, latin, word, hiberia, originating, in, the, ancient, greek, word, ib, r, used, by, greek, geographers, under, the, rule, of, the, roman, empire, to, refer, to, what, is, known, today, in, english, as, the, iberian, peninsula, at, that, time, the, name, did, not, describe, a, single, geographical, entity, or, a, distinct, population, the, same, name, was, used, for, the, kingdom, of, iberia, natively, known, as, kartli, in, the, caucasus, the, core, region, of, what, would, later, become, the, kingdom, of, georgia, it, was, strabo, who, first, reported, the, delineation, of, iberia, from, gaul, keltik, by, the, pyrenees, and, included, the, entire, land, mass, southwest, he, says, west, from, there, with, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, the, consolidation, of, romance, languages, the, word, iberia, continued, the, roman, word, hiberia, and, the, greek, word, the, ancient, greeks, reached, the, iberian, peninsula, of, which, they, had, heard, from, the, phoenicians, by, voyaging, westward, on, the, mediterranean, hecataeus, of, miletus, was, the, first, known, to, use, the, term, iberia, which, he, wrote, about, c, 500, bce, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, says, of, the, phocaeans, that, it, was, they, who, made, the, greeks, acquainted, with, iberia, according, to, strabo, prior, historians, used, iberia, to, mean, the, country, this, side, of, the, ib, ros, the, ebro, as, far, north, as, the, rh, ne, but, in, his, day, they, set, the, pyrenees, as, the, limit, polybius, respects, that, limit, but, identifies, iberia, as, the, mediterranean, side, as, far, south, as, gibraltar, with, the, atlantic, side, having, no, name, elsewhere, he, says, that, saguntum, is, on, the, seaward, foot, of, the, range, of, hills, connecting, iberia, and, celtiberia, according, to, charles, ebel, the, ancient, sources, in, both, latin, and, greek, use, hispania, and, hiberia, greek, iberia, as, synonyms, the, confusion, of, the, words, was, because, of, an, overlapping, in, political, and, geographic, perspectives, the, latin, word, hiberia, similar, to, the, greek, iberia, literally, translates, to, land, of, the, hiberians, this, word, was, derived, from, the, river, hiberus, now, called, ebro, or, ebre, hiber, iberian, was, thus, used, as, a, term, for, peoples, living, near, the, river, ebro, the, first, mention, in, roman, literature, was, by, the, annalist, poet, ennius, in, 200, bce, virgil, wrote, impacatos, h, iberos, restless, iberi, in, his, georgics, the, roman, geographers, and, other, prose, writers, from, the, time, of, the, late, roman, republic, called, the, entire, peninsula, hispania, in, greek, and, roman, antiquity, the, name, hesperia, was, used, for, both, the, italian, and, iberian, peninsula, in, the, latter, case, hesperia, ultima, referring, to, its, position, in, the, far, west, appears, as, form, of, disambiguation, from, the, former, among, roman, writers, also, since, roman, antiquity, jews, gave, the, name, sepharad, to, the, peninsula, as, they, became, politically, interested, in, the, former, carthaginian, territories, the, romans, began, to, use, the, names, hispania, citerior, and, hispania, ulterior, for, near, and, far, hispania, at, the, time, hispania, was, made, up, of, three, roman, provinces, hispania, baetica, hispania, tarraconensis, and, hispania, lusitania, strabo, says, that, the, romans, use, hispania, and, iberia, synonymously, distinguishing, between, the, near, northern, and, the, far, southern, provinces, the, name, iberia, was, ambiguous, being, also, the, name, of, the, kingdom, of, iberia, in, the, caucasus, whatever, languages, may, generally, have, been, spoken, on, the, peninsula, soon, gave, way, to, latin, except, for, that, of, the, vascones, which, was, preserved, as, a, language, isolate, by, the, barrier, of, the, pyrenees, the, modern, phrase, iberian, peninsula, was, coined, by, the, french, geographer, jean, baptiste, bory, de, saint, vincent, on, his, 1823, work, guide, du, voyageur, en, espagne, prior, to, that, date, geographers, had, used, the, terms, spanish, peninsula, or, pyrenaean, peninsula, the, iberian, peninsula, has, been, inhabited, by, members, of, the, homo, genus, for, at, least, 1, 2, million, years, as, remains, found, in, the, sites, in, the, atapuerca, mountains, demonstrate, among, these, sites, is, the, cave, of, gran, dolina, where, six, hominin, skeletons, dated, between, 780, 000, and, one, million, years, ago, were, found, in, 1994, experts, have, debated, whether, these, skeletons, belong, to, the, species, homo, erectus, homo, heidelbergensis, or, a, new, species, called, homo, antecessor, around, 200, 000, bp, during, the, lower, paleolithic, period, neanderthals, first, entered, the, iberian, peninsula, around, 70, 000, bp, during, the, middle, paleolithic, period, the, last, glacial, event, began, and, the, neanderthal, mousterian, culture, was, established, around, 37, 000, bp, during, the, upper, paleolithic, the, neanderthal, ch, telperronian, cultural, period, began, emanating, from, southern, france, this, culture, extended, into, the, north, of, the, peninsula, it, continued, to, exist, until, around, 30, 000, bp, when, neanderthal, man, faced, extinction, about, 40, 000, years, ago, anatomically, modern, humans, entered, the, iberian, peninsula, from, across, the, pyrenees, on, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, humans, developed, a, series, of, different, cultures, such, as, the, aurignacian, gravettian, solutrean, and, magdalenian, cultures, some, of, them, characterized, by, the, complex, forms, of, the, art, of, the, upper, paleolithic, during, the, neolithic, expansion, various, megalithic, cultures, developed, in, the, iberian, peninsula, an, open, seas, navigation, culture, from, the, east, mediterranean, called, the, cardium, culture, also, extended, its, influence, to, the, eastern, coasts, of, the, peninsula, possibly, as, early, as, the, 5th, millennium, bce, these, people, may, have, had, some, relation, to, the, subsequent, development, of, the, iberian, civilization, as, is, the, case, for, most, of, the, rest, of, southern, europe, the, principal, ancestral, origin, of, modern, iberians, are, early, european, farmers, who, arrived, during, the, neolithic, the, large, predominance, of, y, chromosome, haplogroup, r1b, common, throughout, western, europe, is, testimony, to, a, considerable, input, from, various, waves, of, predominantly, male, western, steppe, herders, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, during, the, bronze, age, iberia, experienced, a, significant, genetic, turnover, with, 100, of, the, paternal, ancestry, and, 40, of, the, overall, ancestry, being, replaced, by, peoples, with, steppe, related, ancestry, in, the, chalcolithic, c, 3000, bce, a, series, of, complex, cultures, developed, that, would, give, rise, to, the, peninsula, s, first, civilizations, and, to, extensive, exchange, networks, reaching, to, the, baltic, middle, east, and, north, africa, around, 2800, 2700, bce, the, beaker, culture, which, produced, the, maritime, bell, beaker, probably, originated, in, the, vibrant, copper, using, communities, of, the, tagus, estuary, and, spread, from, there, to, many, parts, of, western, europe, the, bronze, age, began, on, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 2100, cal, bc, according, to, radiocarbon, datings, of, several, key, sites, bronze, age, cultures, developed, beginning, c, 1800, bce, when, the, culture, of, los, millares, was, followed, by, that, of, el, argar, during, the, early, bronze, age, southeastern, iberia, saw, the, emergence, of, important, settlements, a, development, that, has, compelled, some, archeologists, to, propose, that, these, settlements, indicate, the, advent, of, state, level, social, structures, from, this, centre, bronze, metalworking, technology, spread, to, other, cultures, like, the, bronze, of, levante, south, western, iberian, bronze, and, las, cogotas, preceded, by, the, chalcolithic, sites, of, los, millares, the, argaric, culture, flourished, in, southeastern, iberia, in, from, 2200, bc, to, 1550, bc, when, depopulation, of, the, area, ensued, along, with, disappearing, of, copper, bronze, arsenic, metallurgy, the, most, accepted, model, for, el, argar, has, been, that, of, an, early, state, society, most, particularly, in, terms, of, class, division, exploitation, and, coercion, with, agricultural, production, maybe, also, human, labour, controlled, by, the, larger, hilltop, settlements, and, the, elite, using, violence, in, practical, and, ideological, terms, to, clamp, down, on, the, population, ecological, degradation, landscape, opening, fires, pastoralism, and, maybe, tree, cutting, for, mining, have, been, suggested, as, reasons, for, the, collapse, the, culture, of, the, motillas, developed, an, early, system, of, groundwater, supply, plants, the, so, called, motillas, in, the, upper, guadiana, basin, in, the, southern, meseta, in, a, context, of, extreme, aridification, in, the, area, in, the, wake, of, the, 4, 2, kiloyear, climatic, event, which, roughly, coincided, with, the, transition, from, the, copper, age, to, the, bronze, age, increased, precipitation, and, recovery, of, the, water, table, from, about, 1800, bc, onward, should, have, led, to, the, forsaking, of, the, motillas, which, may, have, flooded, and, the, redefinition, of, the, relation, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, territory, with, the, environment, by, the, iron, age, starting, in, the, 8th, century, bce, the, iberian, peninsula, consisted, of, complex, agrarian, and, urban, civilizations, either, pre, celtic, or, celtic, such, as, the, celtiberians, gallaeci, astures, celtici, lusitanians, and, others, the, cultures, of, the, iberians, in, the, eastern, and, southern, zones, and, the, cultures, of, the, aquitanian, in, the, western, portion, of, the, pyrenees, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, bce, the, phoenicians, a, thalassocratic, civilization, originally, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, began, to, explore, the, coastline, of, the, peninsula, interacting, with, the, metal, rich, communities, in, the, southwest, of, the, peninsula, contemporarily, known, as, the, semi, mythical, tartessos, around, 1100, bce, phoenician, merchants, founded, the, trading, colony, of, gadir, or, gades, modern, day, c, diz, phoenicians, established, a, permanent, trading, port, in, the, gadir, colony, c, 800, bce, in, response, to, the, increasing, demand, of, silver, from, the, assyrian, empire, the, seafaring, phoenicians, greeks, and, carthaginians, successively, settled, along, the, mediterranean, coast, and, founded, trading, colonies, there, over, several, centuries, in, the, 8th, century, bce, the, first, greek, colonies, such, as, emporion, modern, emp, ries, were, founded, along, the, mediterranean, coast, on, the, east, leaving, the, south, coast, to, the, phoenicians, together, with, the, presence, of, phoenician, and, greek, epigraphy, several, paleohispanic, scripts, developed, in, the, iberian, peninsula, along, the, 1st, millennium, bce, the, development, of, a, primordial, paleohispanic, script, antecessor, to, the, rest, of, paleohispanic, scripts, originally, supposed, to, be, a, non, redundant, semi, syllabary, derived, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, and, originated, in, southwestern, iberia, by, the, 7th, century, bce, has, been, tentatively, proposed, in, the, sixth, century, bce, the, carthaginians, arrived, in, the, peninsula, while, struggling, with, the, greeks, for, control, of, the, western, mediterranean, their, most, important, colony, was, carthago, nova, modern, day, cartagena, spain, in, 218, bce, during, the, second, punic, war, against, the, carthaginians, the, first, roman, troops, occupied, the, iberian, peninsula, known, to, them, as, hispania, after, 197, the, territories, of, the, peninsula, most, accustomed, to, external, contact, and, with, the, most, urban, tradition, the, mediterranean, coast, and, the, guadalquivir, valley, were,

peninsula, which, required, a, massive, number, of, forced, laborers, initially, from, hispania, and, latter, also, from, the, gallic, borderlands, and, other, locations, of, the, mediterranean, bringing, in, a, far, reaching, environmental, outcome, vis, vis, long, term, global, pollution, records, with, levels, of, atmospheric, pollution, from, mining, across, the, mediterranean, during, classical, antiquity, having, no, match, until, the, industrial, revolution, in, addition, to, mineral, extraction, of, which, the, region, was, the, leading, supplier, in, the, early, roman, world,

the, 15th, century, during, the, 16th, century, spain, created, a, vast, empire, in, the, americas, with, a, state, monopoly, in, seville, becoming, the, center, of, the, ensuing, transatlantic, trade, based, on, bullion, iberian, imperialism, starting, by, the, portuguese, establishment, of, routes, to, asia, and, the, posterior, transatlantic, trade, with, the, new, world, by, spaniards, and, portuguese, along, dutch, english, and, french, precipitated, the, economic, decline, of, the, italian, peninsula, the, 16th, century, was, one, of, population, growth, with, increased, pressure, over, resources, in, the, case, of, the, iberian, peninsula, a, part, of, the, population, moved, to, the, americas, meanwhile, jews, and, moriscos, were, banished, relocating, to, other, places, in, the, mediterranean, basin, most, of, the, moriscos, remained, in, spain, after, the, morisco, revolt, in, las, alpujarras, during, the, mid, 16th, century, but, roughly, 300, 000, of, them, were, expelled, from, the, country, in, 1609, 1614, and, emigrated, en, masse, to, north, africa, in, 1580, after, the, political, crisis, that, followed, the, 1578, death, of, king, sebastian, portugal, became, a, dynastic, composite, entity, of, the, hapsburg, monarchy, thus, the, whole, peninsula, was, united, politically, during, the, period, known, as, the, iberian, union, 1580, 1640, during, the, reign, of, philip, ii, of, spain, i, of, portugal, the, councils, of, portugal, italy, flanders, and, burgundy, were, added, to, the, group, of, counselling, institutions, of, the, hispanic, monarchy, to, which, the, councils, of, castile, aragon, indies, chamber, of, castile, inquisition, orders, and, crusade, already, belonged, defining, the, organization, of, the, royal, court, that, underpinned, the, polysynodial, system, through, which, the, empire, operated, during, the, iberian, union, the, first, great, wave, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, happened, according, to, enriqueta, vila, villar, as, new, markets, opened, because, of, the, unification, gave, thrust, to, the, slave, trade, by, 1600, the, percentage, of, urban, population, for, spain, was, roughly, 11, 4, while, for, portugal, the, urban, population, was, estimated, as, 14, 1, which, were, both, above, the, 7, 6, european, average, of, the, time, edged, only, by, the, low, countries, and, the, italian, peninsula, some, striking, differences, appeared, among, the, different, iberian, realms, castile, extending, across, a, 60, of, the, territory, of, the, peninsula, and, having, 80, of, the, population, was, a, rather, urbanised, country, yet, with, a, widespread, distribution, of, cities, meanwhile, the, urban, population, in, the, crown, of, aragon, was, highly, concentrated, in, a, handful, of, cities, zaragoza, kingdom, of, aragon, barcelona, principality, of, catalonia, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, in, valencia, alicante, and, orihuela, the, case, of, portugal, presented, an, hypertrophied, capital, lisbon, which, greatly, increased, its, population, during, the, 16th, century, from, 56, 000, to, 60, 000, inhabitants, by, 1527, to, roughly, 120, 000, by, the, third, quarter, of, the, century, with, its, demographic, dynamism, stimulated, by, the, asian, trade, followed, at, great, distance, by, porto, and, vora, both, roughly, accounting, for, 12, 500, inhabitants, throughout, most, of, the, 16th, century, both, lisbon, and, seville, were, among, the, western, europe, s, largest, and, most, dynamic, cities, the, 17th, century, has, been, largely, considered, as, a, very, negative, period, for, the, iberian, economies, seen, as, a, time, of, recession, crisis, or, even, decline, the, urban, dynamism, chiefly, moving, to, northern, europe, a, dismantling, of, the, inner, city, network, in, the, castilian, plateau, took, place, during, this, period, with, a, parallel, accumulation, of, economic, activity, in, the, capital, madrid, with, only, new, castile, resisting, recession, in, the, interior, regarding, the, atlantic, fa, ade, of, castile, aside, from, the, severing, of, trade, with, northern, europe, inter, regional, trade, with, other, regions, in, the, iberian, peninsula, also, suffered, to, some, extent, in, aragon, suffering, from, similar, problems, than, castile, the, expelling, of, the, moriscos, in, 1609, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, aggravated, the, recession, silk, turned, from, a, domestic, industry, into, a, raw, commodity, to, be, exported, however, the, crisis, was, uneven, affecting, longer, the, centre, of, the, peninsula, as, both, portugal, and, the, mediterranean, coastline, recovered, in, the, later, part, of, the, century, by, fuelling, a, sustained, growth, the, aftermath, of, the, intermittent, 1640, 1668, portuguese, restoration, war, brought, the, house, of, braganza, as, the, new, ruling, dynasty, in, the, portuguese, territories, across, the, world, bar, ceuta, putting, an, end, to, the, iberian, union, despite, both, portugal, and, spain, starting, their, path, towards, modernization, with, the, liberal, revolutions, of, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, this, process, was, concerning, structural, changes, in, the, geographical, distribution, of, the, population, relatively, tame, compared, to, what, took, place, after,
