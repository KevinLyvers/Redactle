lake, turkana, t, r, k, n, k, n, is, a, saline, lake, in, the, kenyan, rift, valley, in, northern, kenya, with, its, far, northern, end, crossing, into, ethiopia, it, is, the, world, s, largest, permanent, desert, lake, and, the, world, s, largest, alkaline, lake, by, volume, it, is, the, world, s, fourth, largest, salt, lake, after, the, caspian, sea, issyk, kul, and, lake, van, passing, the, shrinking, south, aral, sea, and, among, all, lakes, it, ranks, 24th, lake, turkana, is, now, threatened, by, the, construction, of, the, gilgel, gibe, iii, dam, in, ethiopia, due, to, the, damming, of, the, omo, river, which, supplies, most, of, the, lake, s, water, although, the, lake, commonly, has, been, and, to, some, degree, still, is, used, for, drinking, water, its, salinity, slightly, brackish, and, very, high, levels, of, fluoride, much, higher, than, in, fluoridated, water, generally, make, it, unsuitable, and, it, has, also, been, a, source, of, diseases, spread, by, contaminated, water, increasingly, communities, on, the, lake, s, shores, rely, on, underground, springs, for, drinking, water, the, same, characteristics, that, make, it, unsuitable, for, drinking, limit, its, use, in, irrigation, the, climate, is, hot, and, very, dry, the, rocks, of, the, surrounding, area, are, predominantly, volcanic, central, island, is, an, active, volcano, emitting, vapour, outcrops, and, rocky, shores, are, found, on, the, east, and, south, shores, of, the, lake, while, dunes, spits, and, flats, are, on, the, west, and, north, at, a, lower, elevation, on, shore, and, off, shore, winds, can, be, extremely, strong, as, the, lake, warms, and, cools, more, slowly, than, the, land, sudden, violent, storms, are, frequent, three, rivers, the, omo, turkwel, and, kerio, flow, into, the, lake, but, lacking, outflow, its, only, water, loss, is, by, evaporation, lake, volume, and, dimensions, are, variable, for, example, its, level, fell, by, 10, m, 33, ft, between, 1975, and, 1993, despite, the, lack, of, outflow, in, ecology, it, is, often, regarded, as, a, part, of, or, at, least, associated, with, the, nile, basin, because, of, its, prehistoric, connection, to, this, system, and, the, similarities, in, their, aquatic, faunas, due, to, temperature, its, surface, water, typically, is, 27, 31, c, and, the, mean, air, temperature, of, the, region, generally, is, similar, or, slightly, higher, aridity, and, geographic, inaccessibility, the, lake, retains, its, wild, character, nile, crocodiles, are, found, in, great, abundance, on, the, flats, the, rocky, shores, are, home, to, scorpions, and, carpet, vipers, the, lake, is, rich, in, fish, and, fishing, is, very, important, to, the, local, economy, but, this, is, threatened, by, falling, water, levels, and, overfishing, lake, turkana, national, parks, are, now, listed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, sibiloi, national, park, lies, on, the, lake, s, eastern, shore, while, central, island, national, park, and, south, island, national, park, lie, in, the, lake, both, are, known, for, their, nile, crocodiles, an, abundance, of, hominid, fossils, have, been, discovered, in, the, area, surrounding, lake, turkana, the, area, still, sees, few, visitors, being, two, days, drive, from, nairobi, the, lake, is, also, an, imaginary, boundary, of, the, rendille, and, borana, and, oromo, to, the, turkana, land, the, area, is, primarily, clay, based, and, is, more, alkaline, than, seawater, after, the, independence, of, kenya, the, president, mzee, jomo, kenyatta, renamed, it, in, 1975, after, the, turkana, the, predominant, tribe, there, the, turkana, refer, to, the, lake, as, anam, ka, alakol, meaning, the, sea, of, many, fish, it, is, from, the, name, ka, alakol, that, kalokol, a, town, on, the, western, shore, of, lake, turkana, east, of, lodwar, derives, its, name, the, previous, indigenous, turkana, name, for, lake, turkana, was, anam, a, cheper, natives, who, live, around, lake, turkana, include, the, turkana, rendille, gabbra, daasanach, hamar, koke, karo, nyagatom, mursi, surma, and, molo, peoples, for, the, location, of, many, of, these, peoples, refer, to, the, dialect, map, in, the, article, the, lake, was, originally, named, lake, rudolf, in, honour, of, crown, prince, rudolf, of, austria, by, count, s, muel, teleki, de, sz, k, and, his, second, in, command, lieutenant, ludwig, ritter, von, h, hnel, a, hungarian, and, an, austrian, on, 6, march, 1888, they, were, the, first, europeans, to, have, recorded, visiting, the, lake, after, a, long, safari, across, east, africa, the, lake, kept, its, european, name, during, the, colonial, period, of, british, east, africa, however, the, existence, of, the, lake, and, its, shape, and, location, were, well, known, in, europe, long, before, teleki, conceived, of, his, visit, at, some, unknown, time, the, lake, acquired, an, alternative, name, as, the, jade, sea, from, its, turquoise, colour, seen, approaching, from, a, distance, the, colour, comes, from, algae, that, rise, to, the, surface, in, calm, weather, this, is, likely, also, a, european, name, j, w, gregory, reported, in, the, geographical, journal, of, 1894, that, it, was, called, basso, narok, meaning, black, lake, in, the, samburu, language, likewise, the, nearby, ethiopian, lake, chew, bahir, is, called, basso, naibor, in, samburu, meaning, white, lake, the, samburu, are, among, the, dominant, tribes, in, the, lake, turkana, region, when, the, explorers, came, what, the, native, form, of, this, phrase, was, what, it, might, mean, and, in, which, language, is, not, clear, the, major, biomes, are, the, lake, itself, which, is, an, aquatic, biome, and, the, surrounding, region, which, is, classified, as, desert, and, xeric, shrubland, the, chalbi, desert, is, east, of, the, lake, during, moister, times, a, dry, grassland, appears, featuring, aristida, adcensionis, and, a, mutabilis, during, drier, times, the, grass, disappears, the, shrublands, contain, dwarf, shrubs, such, as, duosperma, eremophilum, and, indigofera, spinosa, near, the, lake, are, doum, palms, both, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, are, found, in, the, lake, of, the, former, cyanobacteria, are, represented, by, microcystis, aeruginosa, and, microalgae, by, botryococcus, braunii, also, present, are, anabaenopsis, arnoldii, planctonema, lauterbornii, oocystis, gigas, sphaerocystis, schroeteri, and, some, others, the, zooplankton, includes, copepods, cladocerans, and, protozoans, compared, to, other, large, african, lakes, turkana, has, relatively, few, fish, species, the, lake, holds, about, 50, fish, species, including, 12, endemics, the, cichlids, haplochromis, macconneli, h, rudolfianus, h, turkanae, and, hemichromis, exsul, the, barb, enteromius, turkanae, the, catfish, chrysichthys, turkana, the, robber, tetras, brycinus, ferox, and, b, minutus, the, rudolf, lates, lates, longispinis, the, lampeyes, lacustricola, jeanneli, and, micropanchax, rudolfianus, and, the, cyprinid, neobola, stellae, non, endemics, include, species, such, as, nile, tilapia, mango, tilapia, bichirs, the, elephantfish, mormyrus, kannume, african, arowana, african, knifefish, distichodus, niloticus, the, nile, perch, and, numerous, others, during, the, early, holocene, the, water, level, of, the, lake, was, higher, and, it, overflowed, into, the, nile, river, allowing, fish, and, crocodiles, access, consequently, the, non, endemic, fishes, in, the, lake, are, mainly, riverine, species, of, nilotic, origin, some, of, the, non, endemics, do, not, breed, in, the, lake, but, migrate, up, the, omo, river, and, other, affluents, to, breed, the, lake, is, heavily, fished, the, lake, turkana, region, is, home, to, hundreds, of, species, of, birds, native, to, kenya, the, east, african, rift, system, also, serves, as, a, flyway, for, migrating, birds, bringing, in, hundreds, more, the, birds, are, essentially, supported, by, plankton, masses, in, the, lake, which, also, feed, the, fish, some, birds, more, common, to, turkana, are, the, little, stint, the, wood, sandpiper, and, the, common, sandpiper, the, african, skimmer, rhyncops, flavirostris, nests, in, the, banks, of, central, island, the, white, breasted, cormorant, phalacrocorax, lucidus, ranges, over, the, lake, as, do, many, other, waterbirds, the, greater, flamingo, wades, in, its, shallows, heuglin, s, bustard, neotis, heuglinii, is, found, in, the, east, of, the, lake, region, the, lake, formerly, contained, africa, s, largest, population, of, nile, crocodiles, 14, 000, as, estimated, in, a, 1968, study, by, alistair, graham, the, lake, also, has, a, large, population, of, large, water, turtles, particularly, in, the, area, of, central, island, the, turkana, mud, turtle, is, endemic, to, the, lake, over, the, dry, grasslands, ranges, a, frail, population, of, grazing, mammals, and, predators, the, grazers, are, chiefly, grevy, s, zebra, burchell, s, zebra, the, beisa, oryx, grant, s, gazelle, the, topi, and, the, reticulated, giraffe, they, are, hunted, by, the, lion, and, the, cheetah, elephants, and, the, black, rhinoceroses, are, no, longer, seen, although, teleki, reported, seeing, and, shooting, many, closer, to, the, dust, is, the, cushioned, gerbil, gerbillus, pulvinatus, lake, turkana, is, an, east, african, rift, feature, a, rift, is, a, weak, place, in, the, earth, s, crust, due, to, the, separation, of, two, tectonic, plates, often, accompanied, by, a, graben, or, trough, in, which, lake, water, can, collect, the, rift, began, when, east, africa, impelled, by, currents, in, the, mantle, began, separating, from, the, rest, of, africa, moving, to, the, northeast, currently, the, graben, is, 320, km, wide, in, the, north, of, the, lake, 170, km, in, the, south, this, rift, is, one, of, two, and, is, called, the, great, or, eastern, rift, there, is, another, to, the, west, the, western, rift, lake, turkana, is, a, unique, feature, of, the, east, african, landscape, besides, being, a, permanent, desert, lake, it, is, the, only, lake, that, retains, the, waters, originating, from, two, separate, catchment, areas, of, the, nile, the, lake, turkana, drainage, basin, draws, its, waters, mainly, from, kenya, highlands, and, ethiopian, highlands, the, basement, rocks, of, the, region, have, been, dated, by, two, analytical, determinations, to, 522, and, 510, million, years, ago, mya, no, rift, was, in, the, offing, at, that, time, a, rift, is, signalled, by, volcanic, activity, through, the, weakened, crust, the, oldest, volcanic, activity, of, the, region, occurred, in, the, nabwal, hills, northeast, of, turkana, and, is, dated, to, 34, 8, mya, in, the, late, eocene, the, visible, tectonic, features, of, the, region, result, from, extensive, extrusions, of, basalt, over, the, turkana, omo, basin, in, the, window, 4, 18, 3, 99, mya, these, are, called, the, gombe, group, basalts, they, are, subdivided, into, the, mursi, basalts, and, the, gombi, basalts, the, two, latter, basalts, are, identified, as, the, outcrops, forming, the, rocky, mountains, and, badlands, around, the, lake, in, the, omo, portion, of, the, basin, of, the, mursi, basalts, the, mursi, formation, is, on, the, west, side, of, the, omo, the, nkalabong, on, the, omo, and, the, usno, and, shungura, east, of, the, omo, probably, the, best, known, of, the, formations, are, the, koobi, fora, on, the, east, side, of, turkana, and, the, nachukui, on, the, west, short, term, fluctuations, in, lake, level, combined, with, periodic, volcanic, ash, spewings, over, the, region, have, resulted, in, a, fortuitous, layering, of, the, ground, cover, over, the, basal, rocks, these, horizons, can, be, dated, more, precisely, by, chemical, analysis, of, the, tuff, as, this, region, is, believed, to, have, been, an, evolutionary, nest, of, hominins, the, dates, are, important, for, generating, a, diachronic, array, of, fossils, both, hominoid, and, nonhominoid, that, is, both, ape, includes, hominins, and, non, ape, many, thousands, have, been, excavated, terraces, representing, ancient, shores, are, visible, in, the, turkana, basin, the, highest, is, 100, m, above, the, surface, of, the, lake, only, approximate, as, the, lake, level, fluctuates, which, occurred, about, 9500, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, african, humid, period, it, is, generally, theorised, that, turkana, was, part, of, the, upper, nile, system, at, that, time, connecting, to, lake, baringo, at, the, southern, end, and, the, white, nile, in, the, north, and, that, volcanic, land, adjustments, severed, the, connection, such, a, hypothesis, explains, the, nile, species, in, the, lake, such, as, the, crocodiles, and, the, nile, perch, high, water, levels, also, occurred, approximately, 9000, 6000, and, 5000, years, ago, each, of, which, were, followed, by, drops, in, lake, level, of, more, than, 40m, in, less, than, 200, years, it, is, thought, that, changes, in, the, position, of, the, congo, air, boundary, affected, the, ability, of, moisture, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, reach, eastern, africa, which, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, level, of, lake, turkana, and, adjacent, water, bodies, the, archaeoastronomical, site, namoratunga, which, has, been, dated, circa, 300, bc, is, located, near, lake, turkana, hominin, fossils, of, some, of, the, earliest, human, ancestors, have, been, found, in, the, turkana, basin, lake, turkana, is, considered, the, cradle, of, human, life, because, of, the, diverse, hominid, species, found, living, millions, of, years, apart, in, this, desert, landscape, these, fossils, have, facilitated, our, understanding, of, the, dynamic, human, evolution, process, and, implies, that, they, descended, from, more, than, one, common, ancestor, diverging, into, multiple, lineages, the, changing, forest, environment, forced, the, early, humans, to, adapt, to, a, more, open, grassland, that, increased, their, exposure, to, threatening, predators, volcanic, ash, and, drier, climates, were, ideal, for, preserving, these, human, fossils, but, it, also, caused, the, lake, to, shrink, or, disappear, at, times, in, a, dry, riverbed, the, lomekwi, 3, site, recovered, primitive, hammers, anvils, and, cutting, tools, however, the, emergence, of, acheulean, technology, no, longer, assumes, that, tool, use, was, a, distinguishing, factor, among, homo, species, as, australopethicus, afarensis, were, also, using, simple, tools, prior, to, the, appearance, of, the, genus, homo, over, 3, 3, million, years, ago, australopithecus, anamensis, fossils, discovered, by, meave, leakey, in, 1994, date, to, around, 4, million, years, ago, setting, the, beginning, date, of, bipedalism, back, half, a, million, years, richard, leakey, has, led, numerous, anthropological, expeditions, in, the, area, which, have, led, to, many, important, discoveries, of, hominin, remains, the, two, million, year, old, skull, 1470, was, found, in, 1972, it, was, originally, thought, to, be, homo, habilis, but, the, scientific, name, homo, rudolfensis, derived, from, the, old, name, of, this, lake, rudolf, was, proposed, in, 1986, by, v, p, alexeev, in, 1984, the, turkana, boy, a, nearly, complete, skeleton, of, a, homo, ergaster, juvenile, was, discovered, by, kamoya, kimeu, more, recently, meave, leakey, discovered, a, 3, 5, million, year, old, skull, there, designated, kenyanthropus, platyops, the, flat, faced, man, of, kenya, marta, miraz, n, lahr, discovered, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, warfare, at, the, site, of, nataruk, located, near, the, shore, of, an, ancient, and, larger, lake, turkana, and, where, numerous, human, skeletons, showing, major, traumatic, injuries, to, the, head, neck, ribs, knees, and, hands, are, evidence, of, inter, group, conflict, between, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, 10, 000, years, ago, with, over, 230, individuals, found, at, the, koobi, fora, site, along, the, western, shore, and, scattered, homo, sapiens, skeletons, with, bone, marks, along, the, eastern, shore, at, the, nataruk, site, this, region, provides, considerable, insight, to, the, way, these, early, humans, thrived, and, survived, the, inconsistent, climate, along, the, lake, shore, and, beyond, homo, erectus, is, the, closest, of, homo, sapiens, ancestors, and, contended, to, be, the, first, hominin, to, cross, the, levantine, corridor, out, of, africa, into, europe, and, asia, 1, 8, million, years, ago, many, language, groups, are, represented, in, the, area, around, lake, turkana, which, is, evidence, for, numerous, migrations, of, diverse, people, over, thousands, of, years, the, current, language, groups, include, at, least, three, separate, subgroups, of, the, nilotic, nilo, saharan, and, cushitic, afro, asiatic, language, families, which, have, further, subdivided, into, more, than, 12, languages, surrounding, the, lake, today, in, the, early, holocene, during, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, lake, levels, were, high, and, fishing, and, foraging, were, the, primary, subsistence, economies, this, was, mostly, supplanted, by, animal, based, agriculture, by, 5000, years, ago, when, the, lake, level, was, in, a, period, of, rapid, fluctuation, during, the, later, holocene, human, responses, to, climatic, changes, included, intensive, fishing, when, lake, level, was, high, and, a, shift, to, cattle, herding, when, the, level, dropped, megalithic, graves, are, found, widely, distributed, on, the, lake, shores, and, appear, to, correspond, to, the, period, when, domesticated, animals, were, first, introduced, to, the, region, about, 5000, years, ago, while, later, the, dead, were, buried, in, small, grave, cairns, people, who, live, in, the, region, today, commonly, practice, mixed, subsistence, switching, between, hunting, fishing, and, animal, herding, based, on, what, is, feasible, in, a, given, year, however, the, construction, of, infrastructure, like, christian, missionary, stations, energy, extraction, wind, oil, and, ngo, aid, distribution, points, have, made, the, region, more, connected, to, and, dependent, on, outside, resources, for, subsistence, traditional, modes, of, subsistence, like, pastoralism, and, fishing, are, now, supplemented, by, the, cash, based, economy, the, lake, turkana, wind, power, consortium, ltwp, plans, to, provide, 310, mw, of, power, to, kenya, s, national, electricity, grid, by, tapping, the, unique, wind, conditions, around, the, lake, the, plan, calls, for, 365, wind, turbines, each, with, a, nameplate, capacity, of, 850, kilowatts, as, of, october, 2016, 155, turbines, had, been, installed, with, completion, expected, in, 2017, it, will, be, the, largest, wind, power, project, in, africa, full, commercial, operation, achieved, in, march, 2019, 100, capacity, factor, meaning, full, 310, mw, generated, achieved, in, march, 2021, the, gibe, iii, dam, is, already, under, construction, by, ethiopia, along, its, omo, river, with, general, recognition, that, it, will, cause, a, major, decrease, in, river, flow, downstream, and, a, serious, reduction, of, inflow, to, kenya, s, lake, turkana, which, receives, 90, per, cent, of, its, waters, from, the, river, according, to, the, arwg, report, these, changes, will, destroy, the, survival, means, of, at, least, 200, 000, pastoralists, flood, dependent, agriculturalists, and, fishers, along, the, omo, river, 300, 000, pastoralists, and, fishers, around, the, shores, of, lake, turkana, plunging, the, region, s, ethnic, groups, into, cross, border, violent, conflict, reaching, well, into, south, sudan, as, starvation, confronts, all, of, them, the, report, offers, a, devastating, look, at, a, deeply, flawed, development, process, fuelled, by, the, special, interests, of, global, finance, and, african, governments, in, the, process, it, identifies, major, overlooked, or, otherwise, minimised, risks, not, the, least, of, which, is, a, u, s, geological, survey, estimation, of, a, high, risk, for, a, magnitude, 7, or, 8, earthquake, in, the, gibe, iii, dam, region, the, magnitude, of, the, impact, that, the, dam, and, possible, irrigation, projects, induced, by, the, dam, will, have, on, the, water, level, of, lake, turkana, is, controversial, a, hydrological, study, conducted, for, the, african, development, bank, in, november, 2010, concluded, that, the, filling, of, the, dam, will, reduce, the, lake, s, water, level, by, two, metres, if, no, irrigation, will, be, undertaken, irrigation, would, cause, a, further, drop, in, the, lake, level, friends, of, lake, turkana, a, kenyan, organisation, representing, indigenous, groups, in, northwestern, kenya, whose, livelihoods, are, linked, to, lake, turkana, had, previously, estimated, that, the, dam, could, reduce, the, level, of, lake, turkana, by, up, to, 10, meter, affecting, up, to, 300, 000, people, this, could, cause, the, brackish, water, to, increase, in, salinity, to, where, it, may, no, longer, be, drinkable, by, the, indigenous, groups, around, the, lake, currently, the, salinity, of, the, water, is, about, 2332, mg, l, and, it, is, estimated, that, a, 10, meter, decrease, in, the, water, level, of, lake, turkana, could, cause, the, salinity, to, rise, to, 3397, mg, l, raising, salinity, could, also, drastically, reduce, the, number, of, fish, in, the, lake, which, the, people, around, lake, turkana, depend, on, for, sustenance, and, their, livelihoods, according, to, critics, this, will, condemn, the, lake, to, a, not, so, slow, death, according, to, dam, proponents, the, impact, on, lake, turkana, will, be, limited, to, the, temporary, reduction, in, flows, during, the, filling, of, the, reservoir, various, sources, state, that, the, filling, could, take, between, one, and, three, wet, seasons, the, total, storage, volume, of, the, reservoir, of, gibe, iii, dam, will, be, between, 11, 75, and, 14, billion, cubic, meter, depending, on, sources, according, to, the, firm, that, builds, the, dam, this, would, reduce, the, water, level, in, the, lake, by, less, than, 50, cm, per, year, for, three, years, and, that, salinity, will, not, change, in, any, way, according, to, the, international, lake, environment, committee, 90, of, lake, turkana, s, water, is, delivered, by, the, omo, river, on, which, the, dam, would, be, built, with, no, outlet, lake, turkana, loses, 2, 3, meters, of, water, every, year, to, evaporation, and, its, level, is, sensitive, to, climatic, and, seasonal, fluctuations, for, purposes, of, comparison, the, historic, level, of, lake, turkana, declined, from, a, high, of, 20m, above, today, s, level, in, the, 1890s, to, the, same, level, as, today, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, then, it, increased, again, gradually, by, 7, metres, to, reach, a, peak, around, 1980, and, subsequently, decreased, again, the, environmental, and, social, impact, assessment, esia, summary, of, the, project, did, not, assess, the, impact, of, the, dam, on, the, water, level, and, water, quality, of, lake, turkana, the, director, of, kenya, s, water, services, regulatory, board, john, nyaoro, argued, that, the, dam, would, have, no, negative, impact, on, lake, turkana, a, kenya, government, report, in, 2021, estimated, that, the, surface, area, of, lake, turkana, had, increased, by, 10, between, 2010, and, 2020
