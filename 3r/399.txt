mount, vesuvius, v, s, u, v, i, s, viss, oo, vee, s, is, a, somma, stratovolcano, located, on, the, gulf, of, naples, in, campania, italy, about, 9, km, 5, 6, mi, east, of, naples, and, a, short, distance, from, the, shore, it, is, one, of, several, volcanoes, forming, the, campanian, volcanic, arc, vesuvius, consists, of, a, large, cone, partially, encircled, by, the, steep, rim, of, a, summit, caldera, resulting, from, the, collapse, of, an, earlier, much, higher, structure, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, in, 79, ad, destroyed, the, roman, cities, of, pompeii, herculaneum, oplontis, stabiae, and, other, settlements, the, eruption, ejected, a, cloud, of, stones, ash, and, volcanic, gases, to, a, height, of, 33, km, 21, mi, erupting, molten, rock, and, pulverized, pumice, at, the, rate, of, 6, 10, 5, cubic, metres, 7, 8, 10, 5, cu, yd, per, second, more, than, 1, 000, people, are, thought, to, have, died, in, the, eruption, though, the, exact, toll, is, unknown, the, only, surviving, witness, account, consists, of, two, letters, by, pliny, the, younger, to, the, historian, tacitus, vesuvius, has, erupted, many, times, since, it, is, the, only, volcano, on, europe, s, mainland, to, have, erupted, in, the, last, hundred, years, it, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, dangerous, volcanoes, in, the, world, because, 3, 000, 000, people, live, near, enough, to, be, affected, by, an, eruption, with, at, least, 600, 000, in, the, danger, zone, this, is, the, most, densely, populated, volcanic, region, in, the, world, eruptions, tend, to, be, violent, and, explosive, these, are, known, as, plinian, eruptions, vesuvius, has, a, long, historic, and, literary, tradition, it, was, considered, a, divinity, of, the, genius, type, at, the, time, of, the, eruption, of, ad, 79, it, appears, under, the, inscribed, name, vesuvius, as, a, serpent, in, the, decorative, frescos, of, many, lararia, or, household, shrines, surviving, from, pompeii, an, inscription, from, capua, to, iovi, vesvvio, indicates, that, he, was, worshipped, as, a, power, of, jupiter, that, is, jupiter, vesuvius, the, romans, regarded, mount, vesuvius, as, being, devoted, to, hercules, the, historian, diodorus, siculus, relates, a, tradition, that, hercules, in, the, performance, of, his, labors, passed, through, the, country, of, nearby, cumae, on, his, way, to, sicily, and, found, there, a, place, called, the, phlegraean, plain, fiery, from, the, mountain, which, of, old, spouted, forth, a, huge, fire, the, mountain, is, called, vesuvius, it, was, inhabited, by, giant, bandits, the, sons, of, the, earth, with, the, gods, assistance, he, pacified, the, region, and, continued, the, facts, behind, the, tradition, if, any, remain, unknown, as, does, whether, herculaneum, was, named, after, it, an, epigram, by, the, poet, martial, in, 88, ad, suggests, that, both, venus, patroness, of, pompeii, and, hercules, were, worshipped, in, the, region, devastated, by, the, eruption, of, 79, vesuvius, was, a, name, of, the, volcano, in, frequent, use, by, the, authors, of, the, late, roman, republic, and, the, early, roman, empire, its, collateral, forms, were, vesaevus, vesevus, vesbius, and, vesvius, writers, in, ancient, greek, used, or, many, scholars, since, then, have, offered, an, etymology, given, that, peoples, of, varying, ethnicity, and, language, occupied, campania, during, the, roman, iron, age, the, etymology, depends, to, a, large, degree, on, the, presumption, of, what, language, was, spoken, there, at, the, time, naples, was, settled, by, greeks, as, the, name, nea, polis, new, city, testifies, the, oscans, an, italic, people, lived, in, the, countryside, the, latins, also, competed, for, the, occupation, of, campania, etruscan, settlements, were, in, the, vicinity, other, peoples, of, unknown, provenance, are, said, to, have, been, there, at, some, time, by, various, ancient, authors, some, theories, about, its, origin, are, vesuvius, is, a, humpbacked, peak, consisting, of, a, large, cone, gran, cono, partially, encircled, by, the, steep, rim, of, a, summit, caldera, caused, by, the, collapse, of, an, earlier, and, originally, much, higher, structure, called, mount, somma, the, gran, cono, was, produced, during, the, a, d, 79, eruption, for, this, reason, the, volcano, is, also, called, somma, vesuvius, or, somma, vesuvio, the, caldera, started, forming, during, an, eruption, around, 17, 000, 18, 000, years, ago, and, was, enlarged, by, later, paroxysmal, eruptions, ending, in, the, one, of, ad, 79, this, structure, has, given, its, name, to, the, term, somma, volcano, which, describes, any, volcano, with, a, summit, caldera, surrounding, a, newer, cone, the, cliffs, forming, the, northern, ridge, of, monte, somma, s, caldera, rim, reach, a, maximum, height, of, 1, 132, m, 3, 714, ft, at, punta, nasone, the, summit, of, the, main, cone, of, vesuvius, is, 1, 281, m, 4, 203, ft, above, sea, level, and, more, than, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, above, the, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, long, valley, of, atrio, di, cavallo, the, northern, floor, of, monte, somma, s, caldera, the, volcano, s, slopes, are, scarred, by, lava, flows, while, the, rest, are, heavily, vegetated, with, scrub, and, forests, at, higher, altitudes, and, vineyards, lower, down, vesuvius, is, a, stratovolcano, and, was, formed, as, a, result, of, the, collision, of, two, tectonic, plates, the, african, and, the, eurasian, the, former, was, subducted, at, a, convergent, boundary, beneath, the, latter, deeper, into, the, earth, as, the, water, saturated, sediments, of, the, african, oceanic, plate, were, pushed, to, hotter, depths, inside, the, planet, the, water, boiled, off, and, lowered, the, melting, point, of, the, upper, mantle, enough, to, partially, melt, the, rocks, because, magma, is, less, dense, than, the, solid, rock, around, it, it, was, pushed, upward, finding, a, weak, spot, at, the, earth, s, surface, it, broke, through, thus, forming, the, volcano, the, volcano, is, one, of, several, forming, the, campanian, volcanic, arc, others, include, campi, flegrei, a, large, caldera, a, few, kilometers, to, the, north, west, ischia, a, volcanic, island, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, to, the, west, and, several, undersea, volcanoes, to, the, south, the, arc, forms, the, southern, end, of, a, larger, chain, of, volcanoes, produced, by, the, subduction, process, described, above, which, extends, northwest, along, the, length, of, italy, as, far, as, monte, amiata, in, southern, tuscany, vesuvius, is, the, only, one, to, have, erupted, in, recent, history, although, some, of, the, others, have, erupted, within, the, last, few, hundred, years, many, are, either, extinct, or, have, not, erupted, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, mount, vesuvius, has, erupted, many, times, numerous, others, preceded, the, eruption, in, ad, 79, in, prehistory, including, at, least, three, significantly, larger, an, example, is, the, avellino, eruption, around, 1800, bc, which, engulfed, several, bronze, age, settlements, since, ad, 79, the, volcano, has, also, erupted, repeatedly, in, 172, 203, 222, possibly, in, 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around, 860, around, 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around, 1073, 1139, 1150, and, there, may, have, been, eruptions, in, 1270, 1347, and, 1500, the, volcano, erupted, again, in, 1631, six, times, in, the, 18th, century, including, 1779, and, 1794, eight, times, in, the, 19th, century, notably, in, 1872, and, in, 1906, 1929, and, 1944, there, have, been, no, eruptions, since, 1944, and, none, of, the, eruptions, after, ad, 79, were, as, large, or, destructive, as, the, pompeian, one, the, eruptions, vary, greatly, in, severity, but, are, characterized, by, explosive, outbursts, of, the, kind, dubbed, plinian, after, pliny, the, younger, a, roman, writer, who, published, a, detailed, description, of, the, ad, 79, eruption, including, his, uncle, s, death, on, occasion, eruptions, from, vesuvius, have, been, so, large, that, the, whole, of, southern, europe, has, been, blanketed, by, ash, in, 472, and, 1631, vesuvian, ash, fell, on, constantinople, istanbul, over, 1, 200, kilometres, 750, mi, away, a, few, times, since, 1944, landslides, in, the, crater, have, raised, clouds, of, ash, dust, raising, false, alarms, of, an, eruption, since, 1750, seven, of, the, eruptions, of, vesuvius, have, had, durations, of, more, than, five, years, only, mount, etna, has, had, as, many, long, duration, eruptions, in, the, last, 270, years, the, two, most, recent, eruptions, of, vesuvius, 1875, 1906, and, 1913, 1944, each, lasted, more, than, 30, years, vesuvius, is, still, regarded, as, an, active, volcano, although, its, current, activity, produces, little, more, than, sulfur, rich, steam, from, vents, at, the, bottom, and, walls, of, the, crater, layers, of, lava, ash, scoria, and, pumice, make, up, the, volcanic, peak, their, mineralogy, is, variable, but, generally, silica, undersaturated, and, rich, in, potassium, with, phonolite, produced, in, the, more, explosive, eruptions, e, g, the, eruption, in, 1631, displaying, a, complete, stratigraphic, and, petrographic, description, phonolite, was, firstly, erupted, followed, by, a, tephritic, phonolite, and, finally, a, phonolitic, tephrite, according, to, the, smithsonian, institution, s, global, volcanism, program, vesuvius, has, had, 54, confirmed, eruptions, during, the, holocene, epoch, the, last, 11, 700, years, a, volcanic, explosivity, index, vei, has, been, assigned, to, all, but, one, of, these, eruptions, scientific, knowledge, of, the, geologic, history, of, vesuvius, comes, from, core, samples, taken, from, a, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, plus, borehole, on, the, flanks, of, the, volcano, extending, into, mesozoic, rock, cores, were, dated, by, potassium, argon, and, argon, argon, dating, the, area, has, been, subject, to, volcanic, activity, for, at, least, 400, 000, years, the, lowest, layer, of, eruption, material, from, the, somma, caldera, lies, on, top, of, the, 40, 000, year, old, campanian, ignimbrite, produced, by, the, campi, flegrei, complex, the, volcanic, complex, stands, on, a, large, sedimentary, plain, several, surviving, works, written, over, the, 200, years, preceding, the, ad, 79, eruption, describe, the, mountain, as, having, had, a, volcanic, nature, although, pliny, the, elder, did, not, depict, the, mountain, in, this, way, in, his, natural, history, in, ad, 79, vesuvius, erupted, in, one, of, the, most, catastrophic, eruptions, of, all, time, historians, have, learned, about, the, eruption, from, the, eyewitness, account, of, pliny, the, younger, a, roman, administrator, and, poet, several, dates, are, given, in, the, surviving, copies, of, the, letters, the, latest, evidence, supports, earlier, findings, and, indicates, that, the, eruption, occurred, after, 17, october, the, volcano, ejected, a, cloud, of, stones, ashes, and, volcanic, gases, to, a, height, of, 33, km, 21, mi, spewing, molten, rock, and, pulverized, pumice, at, the, rate, of, 6, 10, 5, cubic, metres, 7, 8, 10, 5, cu, yd, per, second, ultimately, releasing, 100, 000, times, the, thermal, energy, released, by, the, hiroshima, nagasaki, bombings, the, cities, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, were, destroyed, by, pyroclastic, surges, and, the, ruins, buried, under, tens, of, metres, of, tephra, the, ad, 79, eruption, was, preceded, by, a, powerful, earthquake, in, 62, which, caused, widespread, destruction, around, the, bay, of, naples, and, particularly, to, pompeii, some, of, the, damage, had, still, not, been, repaired, when, the, volcano, erupted, the, deaths, of, 600, sheep, from, tainted, air, in, the, vicinity, of, pompeii, indicates, that, the, earthquake, of, ad, 62, may, have, been, related, to, new, activity, by, vesuvius, the, romans, grew, accustomed, to, minor, earth, tremors, in, the, region, the, writer, pliny, the, younger, even, wrote, that, they, were, not, particularly, alarming, because, they, are, frequent, in, campania, small, earthquakes, started, taking, place, four, days, before, the, eruption, becoming, more, frequent, over, the, next, four, days, but, the, warnings, were, not, recognized, reconstructions, of, the, eruption, and, its, effects, vary, considerably, in, the, details, but, have, the, same, overall, features, the, eruption, lasted, two, days, the, morning, of, the, first, day, was, perceived, as, normal, by, the, only, eyewitness, to, leave, a, surviving, document, pliny, the, younger, in, the, middle, of, the, day, an, explosion, threw, up, a, high, altitude, column, from, which, ash, and, pumice, began, to, fall, blanketing, the, area, rescues, and, escapes, occurred, during, this, time, at, some, time, in, the, night, or, early, the, next, day, pyroclastic, surges, in, the, close, vicinity, of, the, volcano, began, lights, were, seen, on, the, peak, interpreted, as, fires, people, as, far, away, as, misenum, fled, for, their, lives, the, flows, were, rapid, moving, dense, and, very, hot, knocking, down, wholly, or, partly, all, structures, in, their, path, incinerating, or, suffocating, all, population, remaining, there, and, altering, the, landscape, including, the, coastline, additional, light, tremors, accompanied, these, and, a, mild, tsunami, in, the, bay, of, naples, by, late, afternoon, of, the, second, day, the, eruption, was, over, leaving, only, haze, in, the, atmosphere, through, which, the, sun, shone, weakly, the, latest, scientific, studies, of, the, ash, produced, by, vesuvius, reveal, a, multi, phase, eruption, the, initial, major, explosion, produced, a, column, of, ash, and, pumice, ranging, between, 15, and, 30, kilometres, 49, 000, and, 98, 000, ft, high, which, rained, on, pompeii, to, the, southeast, but, not, on, herculaneum, upwind, the, chief, energy, supporting, the, column, came, from, the, escape, of, steam, superheated, by, the, magma, created, from, seawater, seeping, over, time, into, the, deep, faults, of, the, region, which, interacted, with, magma, subsequently, the, cloud, collapsed, as, the, gases, expanded, and, lost, their, capability, to, support, their, solid, contents, releasing, it, as, a, pyroclastic, surge, which, first, reached, herculaneum, but, not, pompeii, additional, blasts, reinstituted, the, column, the, eruption, alternated, between, plinian, and, pel, an, six, times, surges, 3, and, 4, are, believed, by, the, authors, to, have, buried, pompeii, surges, are, identified, in, the, deposits, by, dune, and, cross, bedding, formations, which, are, not, produced, by, fallout, another, study, used, the, magnetic, characteristics, of, over, 200, samples, of, roof, tile, and, plaster, fragments, collected, around, pompeii, to, estimate, the, equilibrium, temperature, of, the, pyroclastic, flow, the, magnetic, study, revealed, that, on, the, first, day, of, the, eruption, a, fall, of, white, pumice, containing, clastic, fragments, of, up, to, 3, centimetres, 1, 2, in, fell, for, several, hours, it, heated, the, roof, tiles, up, to, 140, c, 284, f, this, period, would, have, been, the, last, opportunity, to, escape, the, collapse, of, the, plinian, columns, on, the, second, day, caused, pyroclastic, density, currents, pdcs, that, devastated, herculaneum, and, pompeii, the, depositional, temperature, of, these, pyroclastic, surges, reached, up, to, 300, c, 572, f, any, population, remaining, in, structural, refuges, could, not, have, escaped, as, gases, of, incinerating, temperatures, surrounded, the, city, the, lowest, temperatures, were, in, rooms, under, collapsed, roofs, at, approximately, 100, c, 212, f, the, only, surviving, eyewitness, account, of, the, event, consists, of, two, letters, by, pliny, the, younger, to, the, historian, tacitus, pliny, the, younger, describes, amongst, other, things, the, last, days, in, the, life, of, his, uncle, pliny, the, elder, observing, the, first, volcanic, activity, from, misenum, across, the, bay, of, naples, from, the, volcano, approximately, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, the, elder, pliny, launched, a, rescue, fleet, and, went, himself, to, the, rescue, of, a, personal, friend, his, nephew, declined, to, join, the, party, one, of, the, nephew, s, letters, relates, what, he, could, discover, from, witnesses, of, his, uncle, s, experiences, in, a, second, letter, the, younger, pliny, details, his, own, observations, after, the, departure, of, his, uncle, the, two, men, saw, an, extraordinarily, dense, cloud, rising, rapidly, above, the, peak, this, cloud, and, a, request, by, a, messenger, for, an, evacuation, by, sea, prompted, the, elder, pliny, to, order, rescue, operations, in, which, he, sailed, away, to, participate, his, nephew, attempted, to, resume, a, normal, life, but, that, night, a, tremor, awoke, him, and, his, mother, prompting, them, to, abandon, the, house, for, the, courtyard, further, tremors, near, dawn, caused, the, population, to, abandon, the, village, and, caused, disastrous, wave, action, in, the, bay, of, naples, a, massive, black, cloud, glistering, with, lightning, obscured, the, early, morning, light, a, scene, pliny, describes, as, sheet, lightning, the, cloud, obscured, point, misenum, near, at, hand, and, the, island, of, capraia, capri, across, the, bay, fearing, for, their, lives, the, population, began, to, flee, the, shore, along, the, road, an, ash, rain, fell, causing, pliny, to, shake, it, off, periodically, to, avoid, being, buried, later, that, same, day, the, pumice, and, ash, stopped, falling, and, the, sun, shone, weakly, through, the, cloud, encouraging, pliny, and, his, mother, to, return, to, their, home, and, wait, for, news, of, pliny, the, elder, pliny, s, uncle, pliny, the, elder, was, in, command, of, the, roman, fleet, at, misenum, and, had, meanwhile, decided, to, investigate, the, phenomenon, at, close, hand, in, a, light, vessel, as, the, ship, was, preparing, to, leave, the, area, a, messenger, came, from, his, friend, rectina, wife, of, tascius, living, on, the, coast, near, the, foot, of, the, volcano, explaining, that, her, party, could, only, get, away, by, sea, and, asking, for, rescue, pliny, ordered, the, immediate, launching, of, the, fleet, galleys, to, the, evacuation, of, the, coast, he, continued, in, his, light, ship, to, the, rescue, of, rectina, s, party, he, set, off, across, the, bay, but, in, the, shallows, on, the, other, side, encountered, thick, showers, of, hot, cinders, lumps, of, pumice, and, pieces, of, rock, advised, by, the, helmsman, to, turn, back, he, stated, fortune, favors, the, brave, and, ordered, him, to, continue, to, stabiae, about, 4, 5, km, from, pompeii, pliny, the, elder, and, his, party, saw, what, they, believed, to, be, flames, coming, from, several, parts, of, the, crater, after, staying, overnight, the, party, was, driven, from, the, building, by, an, accumulation, of, material, presumably, tephra, which, threatened, to, block, all, egress, they, woke, pliny, who, had, been, napping, and, emitting, loud, snoring, they, elected, to, take, to, the, fields, with, pillows, tied, to, their, heads, to, protect, them, from, the, raining, debris, they, approached, the, beach, again, but, the, wind, prevented, the, ships, from, leaving, pliny, sat, down, on, a, sail, that, had, been, spread, for, him, and, could, not, rise, even, with, assistance, when, his, friends, departed, though, pliny, the, elder, died, his, friends, ultimately, escaped, by, land, in, the, first, letter, to, tacitus, pliny, the, younger, suggested, that, his, uncle, s, death, was, due, to, the, reaction, of, his, weak, lungs, to, a, cloud, of, poisonous, sulphurous, gas, that, wafted, over, the, group, however, stabiae, was, 16, km, from, the, vent, roughly, where, the, modern, town, of, castellammare, di, stabia, is, situated, and, his, companions, were, unaffected, by, the, volcanic, gases, it, is, more, likely, that, the, corpulent, pliny, died, from, another, cause, such, as, a, stroke, or, heart, attack, his, body, was, found, with, no, apparent, injuries, the, next, day, after, dispersal, of, the, plume, along, with, pliny, the, elder, the, only, other, noble, casualties, of, the, eruption, to, be, known, by, name, were, agrippa, a, son, of, the, herodian, jewish, princess, drusilla, and, the, procurator, antonius, felix, and, his, wife, by, 2003, around, 1, 044, casts, made, from, impressions, of, bodies, in, the, ash, deposits, had, been, recovered, in, and, around, pompeii, with, the, scattered, bones, of, another, 100, the, remains, of, about, 332, bodies, have, been, found, at, herculaneum, 300, in, arched, vaults, discovered, in, 1980, what, percentage, these, numbers, are, of, the, total, dead, or, the, percentage, of, the, dead, to, the, total, number, at, risk, remain, unknown, thirty, eight, percent, of, the, 1, 044, were, found, in, the, ash, fall, deposits, the, majority, inside, buildings, these, are, thought, to, have, been, killed, mainly, by, roof, collapses, with, the, smaller, number, of, victims, found, outside, of, buildings, probably, being, killed, by, falling, roof, slates, or, by, larger, rocks, thrown, out, by, the, volcano, the, remaining, 62, of, remains, found, at, pompeii, were, in, the, pyroclastic, surge, deposits, and, thus, were, probably, killed, by, them, probably, from, a, combination, of, suffocation, from, inhaling, ashes, and, blast, and, debris, thrown, around, examination, of, cloth, frescoes, and, skeletons, shows, that, in, contrast, to, the, victims, found, at, herculaneum, it, is, unlikely, that, high, temperatures, were, a, significant, cause, of, the, destruction, at, pompeii, herculaneum, much, closer, to, the, crater, was, saved, from, tephra, falls, by, the, wind, direction, but, was, buried, under, 23, metres, 75, ft, of, material, deposited, by, pyroclastic, surges, likely, most, of, the, known, victims, in, this, town, were, killed, by, the, surges, people, caught, on, the, former, seashore, by, the, first, surge, died, of, thermal, shock, the, rest, were, concentrated, in, arched, chambers, at, a, density, of, as, high, as, three, persons, per, square, metre, as, only, 85, metres, 279, ft, of, the, coast, have, been, excavated, further, casualties, may, be, discovered, since, the, eruption, of, ad, 79, vesuvius, has, erupted, around, three, dozen, times, the, volcano, became, quiescent, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, and, in, the, following, years, it, again, became, covered, with, gardens, and, vineyards, as, old, even, the, inside, of, the, crater, was, moderately, filled, with, shrubbery, in, march, 1944, the, united, states, army, air, forces, usaaf, 340th, bombardment, group, was, based, at, pompeii, airfield, near, terzigno, italy, just, a, few, kilometres, from, the, eastern, base, of, the, volcano, the,

cubic, kilometre, 0, 24, cu, mi, the, most, recent, of, which, overwhelmed, pompeii, and, herculaneum, have, happened, after, periods, of, inactivity, of, a, few, thousand, years, sub, plinian, eruptions, producing, about, 0, 1, cubic, kilometres, 0, 024, cu, mi, such, as, those, of, 472, and, 1631, have, been, more, frequent, with, a, few, hundred, years, between, them, from, the, 1631, eruption, until, 1944, there, was, a, comparatively, small, eruption, every, few, years, emitting, 0, 001, 0, 01, km, 3, of, magma, for, vesuvius, the, amount, of, magma, expelled, in, an, eruption, increases, roughly, linearly, with, the, interval, since, the, previous, one, and, at, a, rate, of, around, 0, 001, cubic, kilometres, 0, 00024, cu, mi, for, each, year, this, gives, an, approximate, figure, of, 0, 08, cubic, kilometres, 0, 019, cu, mi, for, an, eruption, after, 80, years, of, inactivity, magma, sitting, in, an, underground, chamber, for, many, years, will, start, to, see, higher, melting, point, constituents, such, as, olivine, crystallizing, out, the, effect, is, to, increase, the, concentration, of, dissolved, gases, mostly, sulfur, dioxide, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, remaining, liquid, magma, making, the, subsequent, eruption, more, violent, as, gas, rich, magma, approaches, the, surface, during, an, eruption, the, huge, drop, in, internal, pressure, caused, by, the, reduction, in, weight, of, the, overlying, rock, which, drops, to, zero, at, the, surface, causes, the, gases, to, come, out, of, solution, the, volume, of, gas, increasing, explosively, from, nothing, to, perhaps, many, times, that, of, the, accompanying, magma, additionally, the, removal, of, the, higher, melting, point, material, will, raise, the, concentration, of, felsic, components, such, as, silicates, potentially, making, the, magma, more, viscous, adding, to, the, explosive, nature, of, the, eruption, the, government, emergency, plan, for, an, eruption, therefore, assumes, that, the, worst, case, will, be, an, eruption, of, similar, size, and, type, to, the, 1631, vei, 4, eruption, in, this, scenario, the, volcano, s, slopes, extending, out, to, about, 7, kilometres, 4, 3, mi, from, the, vent, may, be, exposed, to, pyroclastic, surges, sweeping, down, them, whilst, much, of, the, surrounding, area, could, suffer, from, tephra, falls, because, of, prevailing, winds, towns, and, cities, south, and, east, of, the, volcano, are, most, at, risk, from, this, it, is, assumed, that, tephra, accumulation, exceeding, 100, kilograms, per, square, metre, 20, lb, sq, ft, at, which, point, people, are, at, risk, from, collapsing, roofs, may, extend, out, as, far, as, avellino, to, the, east, or, salerno, to, the, south, east, near, naples, this, tephra, fall, hazard, is, assumed, to, extend, barely, past, the, volcano, s, slopes, to, the, northwest, the, specific, areas, affected, by, the, ash, cloud, depend, upon, the, circumstances, surrounding, the, eruption, the, plan, assumes, between, two, weeks, and, 20, days, notice, of, an, eruption, and, foresees, the, emergency, evacuation, of, 600, 000, people, almost, entirely, comprising, all, those, living, in, the, zona, rossa, red, zone, i, e, at, greatest, risk, from, pyroclastic, flows, the, evacuation, by, train, ferry, car, and, bus, is, planned, to, take, about, seven, days, and, the, evacuees, would, mostly, be, sent, to, other, parts, of, the, country, rather, than, to, safe, areas, in, the, local, campania, region, and, may, have, to, stay, away, for, several, months, however, the, dilemma, that, would, face, those, implementing, the, plan, is, when, to, start, this, massive, evacuation, if, it, starts, too, late, thousands, could, be, killed, whereas, if, it, is, started, too, early, the, indicators, of, an, eruption, may, turn, out, to, be, a, false, alarm, in, 1984, 40, 000, people, were, evacuated, from, the, campi, flegrei, area, another, volcanic, complex, near, naples, but, no, eruption, occurred, ongoing, efforts, are, being, made, by, the, government, at, various, levels, especially, of, campania, to, reduce, the, population, living, in, the, red, zone, by, demolishing, illegally, constructed, buildings, establishing, a, national, park, around, the, whole, volcano, to, prevent, the, future, construction, of, buildings, and, by, offering, sufficient, financial, incentives, to, people, for, moving, away, one, of, the, underlying, goals, is, to, reduce, the, time, needed, to, evacuate, the, area, over, the, next, twenty, to, thirty, years, to, two, or, three, days, the, volcano, is, closely, monitored, by, the, osservatorio, vesuvio, in, ercolano, with, extensive, networks, of, seismic, and, gravimetric, stations, a, combination, of, a, gps, based, geodetic, array, and, satellite, based, synthetic, aperture, radar, to, measure, ground, movement, and, by, local, surveys, and, chemical, analyses, of, gases, emitted, from, fumaroles, all, of, this, is, intended, to, track, magma, rising, underneath, the, volcano, the, official, ingv, monitoring, bulletin, from, the, vesuvius, observatory, as, of, july, 2024, classifies, mount, vesuvius, at, a, green, alert, level, this, indicates, a, state, of, low, volcanic, activity, the, surveillance, system, has, not, detected, any, significant, changes, in, vesuvius, activity, state, the, low, energy, earthquakes, are, attributable, to, gravitational, subsidence, activity, of, rocks, inside, the, crater, the, area, around, vesuvius, was, officially, declared, a, national, park, on, 5, june, 1995, the, summit, of, vesuvius, is, open, to, visitors, and, there, is, a, small, network, of, paths, around, the, volcano, that, are, maintained, by, the, park, authorities, on, weekends, there, is, access, by, road, to, within, 200, metres, 660, ft, of, the, summit, measured, vertically, but, after, that, access, is, on, foot, only, there, is, a, spiral, walkway, around, the, volcano, from, the, road, to, the, crater, mount, vesuvius, first, funicular, a, type, of, vertical, transport, that, uses, two, opposing, interconnected, rail, guided, passenger, cars, always, moving, in, concert, opened, in, 1880, subsequently, destroyed, by, the, march, 1944, eruption, funicul, funicul, a, neapolitan, language, song, was, written, to, commemorate, the, opening, of, the,
