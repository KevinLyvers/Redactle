derivation, does, not, account, for, this, kuala, lumpur, lies, at, the, confluence, of, gombak, river, and, klang, river, and, therefore, should, be, named, kuala, gombak, since, the, kuala, is, typically, named, after, the, river, that, joins, a, larger, river, or, the, sea, some, have, argued, that, sungai, lumpur, in, fact, extended, down, to, the, confluence, and, therefore, the, point,
