and, amdo, often, maintained, a, more, decentralized, indigenous, political, structure, being, divided, among, a, number, of, small, principalities, and, tribal, groups, while, also, often, falling, under, chinese, rule, most, of, this, area, was, eventually, annexed, into, the, chinese, provinces, of, sichuan, and, qinghai, the, current, borders, of, tibet, were, generally, established, in, the, 18th, century, following, the, xinhai, revolution, against, the, qing, dynasty, in, 1912, qing, soldiers, were, disarmed, and, escorted, out, of, the, tibet, area, tsang, the, region, subsequently,

service, sector, has, become, the, largest, sector, in, tibet, accounting, for, 50, 1, of, the, local, gdp, in, 2020, the, tibetan, name, for, their, land, bod, means, tibet, or, tibetan, plateau, although, it, originally, meant, the, central, region, around, lhasa, now, known, in, tibetan, as, the, standard, tibetan, pronunciation, of, bod, is, transcribed, as, bh, in, tournadre, phonetic, transcription, b, in, the, thl, simplified, phonetic, transcription, and, poi, in, tibetan, pinyin, some, scholars, believe, the, first, written, reference, to, bod, tibet, was, the, ancient, bautai, people, recorded, in, the, egyptian, greek, works, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, 1st, century, ce, and, geographia, ptolemy, 2nd, century, ce, itself, from, the, sanskrit, form, bhau, a, of, the, indian, geographical, tradition, the, best, known, medieval, chinese, name, for, tibet, is, tubo, chinese, or, t, b, or, t, f, n, this, name, first, appears, in, chinese, characters, as, in, the, 7th, century, li, tai, and, as, in, the, 10th, century, old, book, of, tang, describing, 608, 609, emissaries, from, tibetan, king, namri, songtsen, to, emperor, yang, of, sui, in, the, middle, chinese, language, spoken, during, that, period, as, reconstructed, by, william, h, baxter, was, pronounced, thu, x, phjon, and, was, pronounced, thu, x, pjon, with, the, x, representing, a, shang, tone, other, pre, modern, chinese, names, for, tibet, include, american, tibetologist, elliot, sperling, has, argued, in, favor, of, a, recent, tendency, by, some, authors, writing, in, chinese, to, revive, the, term, tubote, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, t, b, t, for, modern, use, in, place, of, xizang, on, the, grounds, that, tubote, more, clearly, includes, the, entire, tibetan, plateau, rather, than, simply, the, tibet, autonomous, region, the, english, word, tibet, or, thibet, dates, back, to, the, 18th, century, historical, linguists, generally, agree, that, tibet, names, in, european, languages, are, loanwords, from, semitic, bat, or, t, b, tt, arabic, hebrew, itself, deriving, from, turkic, t, b, d, plural, of, t, b, n, literally, the, heights, linguists, generally, classify, the, tibetan, language, as, a, tibeto, burman, language, of, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, although, the, boundaries, between, tibetan, and, certain, other, himalayan, languages, can, be, unclear, according, to, matthew, kapstein, from, the, perspective, of, historical, linguistics, tibetan, most, closely, resembles, burmese, among, the, major, languages, of, asia, grouping, these, two, together, with, other, apparently, related, languages, spoken, in, the, himalayan, lands, as, well, as, in, the, highlands, of, southeast, asia, and, the, sino, tibetan, frontier, regions, linguists, have, generally, concluded, that, there, exists, a, tibeto, burman, family, of, languages, more, controversial, is, the, theory, that, the, tibeto, burman, family, is, itself, part, of, a, larger, language, family, called, sino, tibetan, and, that, through, it, tibetan, and, burmese, are, distant, cousins, of, chinese, the, language, has, numerous, regional, dialects, which, are, generally, not, mutually, intelligible, it, is, employed, throughout, the, tibetan, plateau, and, bhutan, and, is, also, spoken, in, parts, of, nepal, and, northern, india, such, as, sikkim, in, general, the, dialects, of, central, tibet, including, lhasa, kham, amdo, and, some, smaller, nearby, areas, are, considered, tibetan, dialects, other, forms, particularly, dzongkha, sikkimese, sherpa, and, ladakhi, are, considered, by, their, speakers, largely, for, political, reasons, to, be, separate, languages, however, if, the, latter, group, of, tibetan, type, languages, are, included, in, the, calculation, then, greater, tibetan, is, spoken, by, approximately, 6, million, people, across, the, tibetan, plateau, tibetan, is, also, spoken, by, approximately, 150, 000, exile, speakers, who, have, fled, from, modern, day, tibet, to, india, and, other, countries, although, spoken, tibetan, varies, according, to, the, region, the, written, language, based, on, classical, tibetan, is, consistent, throughout, this, is, probably, due, to, the, long, standing, influence, of, the, tibetan, empire, whose, rule, embraced, and, extended, at, times, far, beyond, the, present, tibetan, linguistic, area, which, runs, from, gilgit, baltistan, in, the, west, to, yunnan, and, sichuan, in, the, east, and, from, north, of, qinghai, lake, south, as, far, as, bhutan, the, tibetan, language, has, its, own, script, which, it, shares, with, ladakhi, and, dzongkha, and, which, is, derived, from, the, ancient, indian, br, hm, script, starting, in, 2001, the, local, deaf, sign, languages, of, tibet, were, standardized, and, tibetan, sign, language, is, now, being, promoted, across, the, country, the, first, tibetan, english, dictionary, and, grammar, book, was, written, by, alexander, csoma, de, k, r, s, in, 1834, humans, inhabited, the, tibetan, plateau, at, least, 21, 000, years, ago, this, population, was, largely, replaced, around, 3, 000, bp, by, neolithic, immigrants, from, northern, china, but, there, is, a, partial, genetic, continuity, between, the, paleolithic, inhabitants, and, contemporary, tibetan, populations, the, earliest, tibetan, historical, texts, identify, the, zhang, zhung, culture, as, a, people, who, migrated, from, the, amdo, region, into, what, is, now, the, region, of, guge, in, western, tibet, zhang, zhung, is, considered, to, be, the, original, home, of, the, b, n, religion, by, the, 1st, century, bce, a, neighboring, kingdom, arose, in, the, yarlung, valley, and, the, yarlung, king, drigum, tsenpo, attempted, to, remove, the, influence, of, the, zhang, zhung, by, expelling, the, zhang, s, b, n, priests, from, yarlung, he, was, assassinated, and, zhang, zhung, continued, its, dominance, of, the, region, until, it, was, annexed, by, songtsen, gampo, in, the, 7th, century, prior, to, songtsen, gampo, the, kings, of, tibet, were, more, mythological, than, factual, and, there, is, insufficient, evidence, of, their, existence, the, history, of, a, unified, tibet, begins, with, the, rule, of, songtsen, gampo, 604, 650, ce, who, united, parts, of, the, yarlung, river, valley, and, founded, the, tibetan, empire, he, also, brought, in, many, reforms, and, tibetan, power, spread, rapidly, creating, a, large, and, powerful, empire, it, is, traditionally, considered, that, his, first, wife, was, the, princess, of, nepal, bhrikuti, and, that, she, played, a, great, role, in, the, establishment, of, buddhism, in, tibet, in, 640, he, married, princess, wencheng, the, niece, of, the, chinese, emperor, taizong, of, tang, china, under, the, next, few, tibetan, kings, buddhism, became, established, as, the, state, religion, and, tibetan, power, increased, even, further, over, large, areas, of, central, asia, while, major, inroads, were, made, into, chinese, territory, even, reaching, the, tang, s, capital, chang, an, modern, xi, an, in, late, 763, however, the, tibetan, occupation, of, chang, an, only, lasted, for, fifteen, days, after, which, they, were, defeated, by, tang, and, its, ally, the, turkic, uyghur, khaganate, the, kingdom, of, nanzhao, in, yunnan, and, neighbouring, regions, remained, under, tibetan, control, from, 750, to, 794, when, they, turned, on, their, tibetan, overlords, and, helped, the, chinese, inflict, a, serious, defeat, on, the, tibetans, in, 747, the, hold, of, tibet, was, loosened, by, the, campaign, of, general, gao, xianzhi, who, tried, to, re, open, the, direct, communications, between, central, asia, and, kashmir, by, 750, the, tibetans, had, lost, almost, all, of, their, central, asian, possessions, to, the, chinese, however, after, gao, xianzhi, s, defeat, by, the, arabs, and, qarluqs, at, the, battle, of, talas, 751, and, the, subsequent, civil, war, known, as, the, an, lushan, rebellion, 755, chinese, influence, decreased, rapidly, and, tibetan, influence, resumed, at, its, height, in, the, 780s, to, 790s, the, tibetan, empire, reached, its, highest, glory, when, it, ruled, and, controlled, a, territory, stretching, from, modern, day, afghanistan, bangladesh, bhutan, burma, china, india, nepal, pakistan, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, in, 821, 822, ce, tibet, and, china, signed, a, peace, treaty, a, bilingual, account, of, this, treaty, including, details, of, the, borders, between, the, two, countries, is, inscribed, on, a, stone, pillar, which, stands, outside, the, jokhang, temple, in, lhasa, tibet, continued, as, a, central, asian, empire, until, the, mid, 9th, century, when, a, civil, war, over, succession, led, to, the, collapse, of, imperial, tibet, the, period, that, followed, is, known, traditionally, as, the, era, of, fragmentation, when, political, control, over, tibet, became, divided, between, regional, warlords, and, tribes, with, no, dominant, centralized, authority, an, islamic, invasion, from, bengal, took, place, in, 1206, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty,

the, ganden, phodrang, qing, dynasty, rule, in, tibet, began, with, their, 1720, expedition, to, the, country, when, they, expelled, the, invading, dzungars, amdo, came, under, qing, control, in, 1724, and, eastern, kham, was, incorporated, into, neighbouring, chinese, provinces, in, 1728, meanwhile, the, qing, government, sent, resident, commissioners, called, ambans, to, lhasa, in, 1750, the, ambans, and, the, majority, of, the, han, chinese, and, manchus, living, in, lhasa, were, killed, in, a, riot, and, qing, troops, arrived, quickly, and, suppressed, the, rebels, in, the, next, year, like, the, preceding, yuan, dynasty, the, manchus, of, the, qing, dynasty, exerted, military, and, administrative, control, of, the, region, while, granting, it, a, degree, of, political, autonomy, the, qing, commander, publicly, executed, a, number, of, supporters, of, the, rebels, and, as, in, 1723, and, 1728, made, changes, in, the, political, structure, and, drew, up, a, formal, organization, plan, the, qing, now, restored, the, dalai, lama, as, ruler, leading, the, governing, council, called, kashag, but, elevated, the, role, of, ambans, to, include, more, direct, involvement, in, tibetan, internal, affairs, at, the, same, time, the, qing, took, steps, to, counterbalance, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, by, adding, officials, recruited, from, the, clergy, to, key, posts, for, several, decades, peace, reigned, in, tibet, but, in, 1792, the, qing, qianlong, emperor, sent, a, large, chinese, army, into, tibet, to, push, the, invading, nepalese, out, this, prompted, yet, another, qing, reorganization, of, the, tibetan, government, this, time, through, a, written, plan, called, the, twenty, nine, regulations, for, better, government, in, tibet, qing,

the, years, immediately, following, the, 1792, regulations, were, the, peak, of, the, qing, imperial, commissioners, authority, but, there, was, no, attempt, to, make, tibet, a, chinese, province, in, 1834, the, sikh, empire, invaded, and, annexed, ladakh, a, culturally, tibetan, region, that, was, an, independent, kingdom, at, the, time, seven, years, later, a, sikh, army, led, by, general, zorawar, singh, invaded, western, tibet, from, ladakh, starting, the, sino, sikh, war, a, qing, tibetan, army, repelled, the, invaders, but, was, in, turn, defeated, when, it, chased, the, sikhs, into, ladakh, the, war, ended, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, chushul, between, the, chinese, and, sikh, empires, as, the, qing, dynasty, weakened, its, authority, over, tibet, also, gradually, declined, and, by, the, mid, 19th, century, its, influence, was, minuscule, qing, authority, over, tibet, had, become, more, symbolic, than, real, by, the, late, 19th, century, although, in, the, 1860s, the, tibetans, still, chose, for, reasons, of, their, own, to, emphasize, the, empire, s, symbolic, authority, and, make, it, seem, substantial, in, 1774, a, scottish, nobleman, george, bogle, travelled, to, shigatse, to, investigate, prospects, of, trade, for, the, east, india, company, his, efforts, while, largely, unsuccessful, established, permanent, contact, between, tibet, and, the, western, world, however, in, the, 19th, century, tensions, between, foreign, powers, and, tibet, increased, the, british, empire, was, expanding, its, territories, in, india, into, the, himalayas, while, the, emirate, of, afghanistan, and, the, russian, empire, were, both, doing, likewise, in, central, asia, in, 1904, a, british, expedition, to, tibet, spurred, in, part, by, a, fear, that, russia, was, extending, its, power, into, tibet, as, part, of, the, great, game, was, launched, although, the, expedition, initially, set, out, with, the, stated, purpose, of, resolving, border, disputes, between, tibet, and, sikkim, it, quickly, turned, into, a, military, invasion, the, british, expeditionary, force, consisting, of, mostly, indian, troops, quickly, invaded, and, captured, lhasa, with, the, dalai, lama, fleeing, to, the, countryside, afterwards, the, leader, of, the, expedition, sir, francis, younghusband, negotiated, the, convention, between, great, britain, and, tibet, with, the, tibetans, which, guaranteed, the, british, great, economic, influence, but, ensured, the, region, remained, under, chinese, control, the, qing, imperial, resident, known, as, the, amban, publicly, repudiated, the, treaty, while, the, british, government, eager, for, friendly, relations, with, china, negotiated, a, new, treaty, two, years, later, known, as, the, convention, between, great, britain, and, china, respecting, tibet, the, british, agreed, not, to, annex, or, interfere, in, tibet, in, return, for, an, indemnity, from, the, chinese, government, while, china, agreed, not, to, permit, any, other, foreign, state, to, interfere, with, the, territory, or, internal, administration, of, tibet, in, 1910, the, qing, government, sent, a, military, expedition, of, its, own, under, zhao, erfeng, to, establish, direct, manchu, chinese, rule, and, in, an, imperial, edict, deposed, the, dalai, lama, who, fled, to, british, india, zhao, erfeng, defeated, the, tibetan, military, conclusively, and, expelled, the, dalai, lama, s, forces, from, the, province, his, actions, were, unpopular, and, there, was, much, animosity, against, him, for, his, mistreatment, of, civilians, and, disregard, for, local, culture, after, the, xinhai, revolution, 1911, 1912, toppled, the, qing, dynasty, and, the, last, qing, troops, were, escorted, out, of, tibet, the, new, republic, of, china, apologized, for, the, actions, of, the, qing, and, offered, to, restore, the, dalai, lama, s, title, the, dalai, lama, refused, any, chinese, title, and, declared, himself, ruler, of, an, independent, tibet, in, 1913, tibet, and, mongolia, concluded, a, treaty, of, mutual, recognition, the, roc, continued, to, view, the, former, qing, territory, as, its, own, including, tibet, 69, for, the, next, 36, years, the, 13th, dalai, lama, and, the, regents, who, succeeded, him, governed, tibet, during, this, time, tibet, fought, chinese, warlords, for, control, of, the, ethnically, tibetan, areas, in, xikang, and, qinghai, parts, of, kham, and, amdo, along, the, upper, reaches, of, the, yangtze, river, in, 1914, the, tibetan, government, signed, the, simla, convention, with, britain, which, recognized, chinese, suzerainty, over, tibet, in, return, for, a, border, settlement, china, refused, to, sign, the, convention, tibet, continued, to, lack, clear, boundaries, or, international, recognition, of, its, status, 69, when, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, regents, displayed, negligence, in, affairs, the, kuomintang, government, of, the, republic, of, china, took, advantage, of, this, to, expand, its, reach, into, the, territory, on, december, 20, 1941, kuomintang, leader, chiang, kai, shek, noted, in, his, diary, that, tibet, would, be, among, the, territories, which, he, would, demand, as, restitution, for, china, following, the, conclusion, of, world, war, ii, emerging, with, control, over, most, of, mainland, china, after, the, chinese, civil, war, the, people, s, republic, of, china, annexed, tibet, in, 1950, and, negotiated, the, seventeen, point, agreement, with, the, newly, enthroned, 14th, dalai, lama, s, government, affirming, the, people, s, republic, of, china, s, sovereignty, but, granting, the, area, autonomy, subsequently, on, his, journey, into, exile, the, 14th, dalai, lama, completely, repudiated, the, agreement,
