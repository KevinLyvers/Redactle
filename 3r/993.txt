the, hijra, or, approximately, the, 9th, century, bce, by, the, fourth, century, arab, tribes, began, to, encroach, from, yemen, and, there, were, three, prominent, jewish, tribes, that, inhabited, the, city, around, the, time, of, muhammad, the, banu, qaynuqa, the, banu, qurayza, and, banu, nadir, ibn, khordadbeh, later, reported, that, during, the, persian, empire, s, domination, in, hejaz, the, banu, qurayza, served, as, tax, collectors, for, the, persian, shah, the, situation, changed, after, the, arrival, of, two, new, arab, tribes, the, aws, or, banu, aws, and, the, khazraj, also, known, as, the, banu, khazraj, at, first, these, tribes, were, allied, with, the, jewish, tribes, who, ruled, the, region, but, they, later, revolted, and, became, independent, toward, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, the, jewish, rulers, lost, control, of, the, city, to, the, two, arab, tribes, most, modern, historians, accept, the, claim, of, the, muslim, sources, that, after, the, revolt, the, jewish, tribes, became, clients, of, the, aws, and, the, khazraj, however, according, to, scottish, scholar, william, montgomery, watt, the, clientship, of, the, jewish, tribes, is, not, borne, out, by, the, historical, accounts, of, the, period, prior, to, 627, and, he, maintained, that, the, jewish, populace, retained, a, measure, of, political, independence, early, muslim, chronicler, ibn, ishaq, tells, of, an, ancient, conflict, between, the, last, yemenite, king, of, the, himyarite, kingdom, and, the, residents, of, yathrib, when, the, king, was, passing, by, the, oasis, the, residents, killed, his, son, and, the, yemenite, ruler, threatened, to, exterminate, the, people, and, cut, down, the, palms, according, to, ibn, ishaq, he, was, stopped, from, doing, so, by, two, rabbis, from, the, banu, qurayza, tribe, who, implored, the, king, to, spare, the, oasis, because, it, was, the, place, to, which, a, prophet, of, the, quraysh, would, migrate, in, time, to, come, and, it, would, be, his, home, and, resting, place, the, yemenite, king, thus, did, not, destroy, the, town, and, converted, to, judaism, he, took, the, rabbis, with, him, and, in, mecca, they, reportedly, recognized, the, ka, bah, as, a, temple, built, by, abraham, and, advised, the, king, to, do, what, the, people, of, mecca, did, to, circumambulate, the, temple, to, venerate, and, honor, it, to, shave, his, head, and, to, behave, with, all, humility, until, he, had, left, its, precincts, on, approaching, yemen, tells, ibn, ishaq, the, rabbis, demonstrated, to, the, local, people, a, miracle, by, coming, out, of, a, fire, unscathed, and, the, yemenites, accepted, judaism, eventually, the, banu, aws, and, the, banu, khazraj, became, hostile, to, each, other, and, by, the, time, of, muhammad, s, hijrah, emigration, to, medina, in, 622, they, had, been, fighting, for, 120, years, and, were, sworn, enemies, the, banu, nadir, and, the, banu, qurayza, were, allied, with, the, aws, while, the, banu, qaynuqa, sided, with, the, khazraj, they, fought, a, total, of, four, wars, their, last, and, bloodiest, known, battle, was, the, battle, of, bu, ath, fought, a, few, years, prior, to, the, arrival, of, muhammad, the, outcome, of, the, battle, was, inconclusive, and, the, feud, continued, abd, allah, ibn, ubayy, one, khazraj, chief, had, refused, to, take, part, in, the, battle, which, earned, him, a, reputation, for, equity, and, peacefulness, he, was, the, most, respected, inhabitant, of, the, city, prior, to, muhammad, s, arrival, to, solve, the, ongoing, feud, concerned, residents, of, yathrib, met, secretly, with, muhammad, in, aqaba, a, place, outside, mecca, inviting, him, and, his, small, group, of, believers, to, come, to, the, city, where, muhammad, could, serve, a, mediator, between, the, factions, and, his, community, could, practice, its, faith, freely, in, 622, muhammad, and, an, estimated, 70, meccan, muhajirun, left, mecca, over, a, period, of, a, few, months, for, sanctuary, in, yathrib, an, event, that, transformed, the, religious, and, political, landscape, of, the, city, completely, the, longstanding, enmity, between, the, aus, and, khazraj, tribes, was, dampened, as, many, of, the, two, arab, tribes, and, some, local, jews, embraced, the, new, religion, of, islam, muhammad, linked, to, the, khazraj, through, his, great, grandmother, was, agreed, on, as, the, leader, of, the, city, the, natives, of, yathrib, who, had, converted, to, islam, of, any, background, pagan, arab, or, jewish, were, called, the, ansar, the, patrons, or, the, helpers, according, to, ibn, ishaq, all, parties, in, the, area, agreed, to, the, constitution, of, medina, which, committed, all, parties, to, mutual, cooperation, under, the, leadership, of, muhammad, the, nature, of, this, document, as, recorded, by, ibn, ishaq, and, transmitted, by, ibn, hisham, is, the, subject, of, dispute, among, modern, western, historians, many, of, whom, maintain, that, this, treaty, is, possibly, a, collage, of, different, agreements, oral, rather, than, written, of, different, dates, and, that, it, is, not, clear, exactly, when, they, were, made, other, scholars, however, both, western, and, muslim, argue, that, the, text, of, the, agreement, whether, a, single, document, originally, or, several, is, possibly, one, of, the, oldest, islamic, texts, we, possess, in, yemenite, jewish, sources, another, treaty, was, drafted, between, muhammad, and, his, jewish, subjects, known, as, kit, b, dimmat, al, nabi, written, in, the, 3rd, year, of, the, hijra, 625, and, which, gave, express, liberty, to, jews, living, in, arabia, to, observe, the, sabbath, and, to, grow, out, their, side, locks, in, return, they, were, to, pay, the, jizya, annually, for, protection, by, their, patrons, while, the, muslims, would, pay, the, zakat, tax, in, the, year, 625, abu, sufyan, ibn, harb, a, senior, chieftain, of, mecca, who, later, converted, to, islam, led, a, meccan, force, against, medina, muhammad, marched, out, to, meet, the, qurayshi, army, with, an, estimated, 1, 000, troops, but, just, as, the, army, approached, the, battlefield, 300, men, under, abd, allah, ibn, ubayy, withdrew, dealing, a, severe, blow, to, the, muslim, army, s, morale, muhammad, continued, marching, with, his, now, 700, strong, force, and, ordered, a, group, of, 50, archers, to, climb, a, small, hill, now, called, jabal, ar, rummaah, the, archers, hill, to, keep, an, eye, on, the, meccan, s, cavalry, and, to, provide, protection, to, the, rear, of, the, muslim, s, army, as, the, battle, heated, up, the, meccans, were, forced, to, retreat, the, frontline, was, pushed, further, and, further, away, from, the, archers, and, foreseeing, the, battle, to, be, a, victory, for, the, muslims, the, archers, decided, to, leave, their, posts, to, pursue, the, retreating, meccans, a, small, party, however, stayed, behind, pleading, the, rest, to, not, disobey, muhammad, s, orders, seeing, that, the, archers, were, starting, to, descend, from, the, hill, khalid, ibn, al, walid, commanded, his, unit, to, ambush, the, hill, and, his, cavalry, unit, pursued, the, descending, archers, were, systematically, slain, by, being, caught, in, the, plain, ahead, of, the, hill, and, the, frontline, watched, upon, by, their, desperate, comrades, who, stayed, behind, up, in, the, hill, who, were, shooting, arrows, to, thwart, the, raiders, but, with, little, to, no, effect, however, the, meccans, did, not, capitalize, on, their, advantage, by, invading, medina, and, returned, to, mecca, the, madanis, people, of, medina, suffered, heavy, losses, and, muhammad, was, injured, in, 627, abu, sufyan, led, another, force, toward, medina, knowing, of, his, intentions, muhammad, asked, for, proposals, for, defending, the, northern, flank, of, the, city, as, the, east, and, west, were, protected, by, volcanic, rocks, and, the, south, was, covered, with, palm, trees, salman, al, farsi, a, persian, sahabi, who, was, familiar, with, sasanian, war, tactics, recommended, digging, a, trench, to, protect, the, city, and, muhammad, accepted, it, the, subsequent, siege, came, to, be, known, as, the, battle, of, the, trench, and, the, battle, of, the, confederates, after, a, month, long, siege, and, various, skirmishes, the, meccans, withdrew, again, due, to, the, harsh, winter, during, the, siege, abu, sufyan, contacted, the, jewish, tribe, of, banu, qurayza, and, formed, an, agreement, with, them, to, attack, the, muslim, defenders, and, effectively, encircle, the, defenders, it, was, however, discovered, by, the, muslims, and, thwarted, this, was, in, breach, of, the, constitution, of, medina, and, after, the, meccan, withdrawal, muhammad, immediately, marched, against, the, qurayza, and, laid, siege, to, their, strongholds, the, jewish, forces, eventually, surrendered, some, members, of, the, aws, negotiated, on, behalf, of, their, old, allies, and, muhammad, agreed, to, appoint, one, of, their, chiefs, who, had, converted, to, islam, sa, d, ibn, mu, adh, as, judge, sa, ad, judged, that, all, male, members, of, the, tribe, should, be, killed, and, the, women, and, children, enslaved, this, action, was, conceived, of, as, a, defensive, measure, to, ensure, that, the, muslim, community, could, be, confident, of, its, continued, survival, in, medina, the, french, historian, robert, mantran, proposes, that, from, this, point, of, view, it, was, successful, from, this, point, on, the, muslims, were, no, longer, primarily, concerned, with, survival, but, with, expansion, and, conquest, in, the, ten, years, following, the, hijra, medina, formed, the, base, from, which, muhammad, and, the, muslim, army, attacked, and, were, attacked, and, it, was, from, here, that, he, marched, on, mecca, entering, it, without, battle, in, 630, despite, muhammad, s, tribal, connection, to, mecca, the, growing, importance, of, mecca, in, islam, the, significance, of, the, ka, bah, as, the, center, of, the, islamic, world, as, the, direction, of, prayer, qibla, and, in, the, islamic, pilgrimage, hajj, muhammad, returned, to, medina, which, remained, for, some, years, the, most, important, city, of, islam, and, the, base, of, operations, of, the, early, rashidun, caliphate, the, city, is, presumed, to, have, been, renamed, madinat, al, nabi, city, of, the, prophet, in, arabic, in, honor, of, muhammad, s, prophethood, and, the, city, being, the, site, of, his, burial, alternatively, lucien, gubbay, suggests, the, name, medina, could, also, have, been, a, derivative, from, the, aramaic, word, medinta, which, the, jewish, inhabitants, could, have, used, for, the, city, under, the, first, three, caliphs, abu, bakr, umar, and, uthman, medina, was, the, capital, of, a, rapidly, increasing, muslim, empire, during, the, reign, of, uthman, ibn, al, affan, the, third, caliph, a, party, of, arabs, from, egypt, disgruntled, at, some, of, his, political, decisions, attacked, medina, in, 656, and, assassinated, him, in, his, own, home, ali, the, fourth, caliph, changed, the, capital, of, the, caliphate, from, medina, to, kufa, in, iraq, for, being, in, a, more, strategic, location, since, then, medina, s, importance, dwindled, becoming, more, a, place, of, religious, importance, than, of, political, power, medina, witnessed, little, to, no, economic, growth, during, and, after, ali, s, reign, after, al, hasan, the, son, of, ali, ceded, power, to, mu, awiyah, i, son, of, abu, sufyan, mu, awiyah, marched, into, kufa, ali, s, capital, and, received, the, allegiance, of, the, local, iraqis, this, is, considered, to, be, the, beginning, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, mu, awiyah, s, governors, took, special, care, of, medina, and, dug, the, ayn, az, zarqa, a, blue, spring, spring, along, with, a, project, that, included, the, creation, of, underground, ducts, for, the, purposes, of, irrigation, dams, were, built, in, some, of, the, wadis, and, the, subsequent, agricultural, boom, led, to, the, strengthening, of, the, economy, following, a, period, of, unrest, during, the, second, fitna, in, 679, husayn, ibn, ali, was, martyred, at, karbala, and, yazid, assumed, unchecked, control, for, the, next, three, years, in, 682, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, declared, himself, caliph, of, mecca, and, the, people, of, medina, swore, allegiance, to, him, this, led, to, an, eight, year, long, period, of, economic, distress, for, the, city, in, 692, the, umayyads, regained, power, and, medina, experienced, its, second, period, of, huge, economic, growth, trade, improved, and, more, people, moved, into, the, city, the, banks, of, wadi, al, aqiq, were, now, lush, with, greenery, this, period, of, peace, and, prosperity, coincided, with, the, rule, of, umar, ibn, abdulaziz, who, many, consider, to, be, the, fifth, of, the, rashidun, abdulbasit, a, badr, in, his, book, madinah, the, enlightened, city, history, and, landmarks, divides, this, period, into, three, distinct, phases, badr, describes, the, period, between, 749, and, 974, as, a, push, and, pull, between, peace, and, political, turmoil, while, medina, continued, to, pay, allegiance, to, the, abbasids, from, 974, to, 1151, the, sharifate, of, medina, was, in, a, liaison, with, the, fatimids, even, though, the, political, stand, between, the, two, remained, turbulent, and, did, not, exceed, the, normal, allegiance, from, 1151, onwards, medina, paid, allegiance, to, the, zengids, and, the, emir, nuruddin, zengi, took, care, of, the, roads, used, by, pilgrims, and, funded, the, fixing, of, the, water, sources, and, streets, when, he, visited, medina, in, 1162, he, ordered, the, construction, of, a, new, wall, that, encompassed, the, new, urban, areas, outside, the, old, city, wall, zengi, was, succeeded, by, saladin, founder, of, the, ayyubid, dynasty, who, supported, qasim, ibn, muhanna, the, sharif, of, medina, and, greatly, funded, the, growth, of, the, city, while, slashing, taxes, paid, by, the, pilgrims, he, also, funded, the, bedouins, who, lived, on, the, routes, used, by, pilgrims, to, protect, them, on, their, journeys, the, later, abbasids, also, continued, to, fund, the, expenses, of, the, city, while, medina, was, formally, allied, with, the, abbasids, during, this, period, they, maintained, closer, relations, with, the, zengids, and, ayyubids, the, historic, city, formed, an, oval, surrounded, by, a, strong, wall, 30, to, 40, ft, 9, 1, to, 12, 2, m, high, dating, from, this, period, and, was, flanked, with, towers, of, its, four, gates, the, bab, al, salam, the, gate, of, peace, was, remarked, for, its, beauty, beyond, the, walls, of, the, city, the, west, and, south, were, suburbs, consisting, of, low, houses, yards, gardens, and, plantations, after, the, fall, of, baghdad, the, capital, of, the, abbasid, empire, to, the, mongols, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, cairo, took, over, the, egyptian, governorate, and, effectively, gained, control, of, medina, in, 1258, medina, was, threatened, by, lava, from, the, harrat, rahat, volcanic, region, but, was, narrowly, saved, from, being, burnt, after, the, lava, turned, northward, during, mamluk, reign, the, masjid, an, nabawi, caught, fire, twice, once, in, 1256, when, the, storage, caught, fire, burning, the, entire, mosque, and, the, other, time, in, 1481, when, the, masjid, was, struck, by, lightning, this, period, also, coincided, with, an, increase, in, scholarly, activity, in, medina, with, scholars, such, as, ibn, farhun, al, hafiz, zain, al, din, al, iraqi, al, sakhawi, and, others, settling, in, the, city, the, striking, iconic, green, dome, also, found, its, beginnings, as, a, cupola, built, under, mamluk, sultan, al, mansur, qalawun, as, salihi, in, 1297, in, 1517, the, first, ottoman, period, began, with, selim, i, s, conquest, of,

fortress, around, the, city, and, constructed, a, strong, castle, armed, by, an, ottoman, battalion, to, protect, the, city, this, is, also, the, period, in, which, many, of, the, prophet, s, mosque, s, modern, features, were, built, even, though, it, was, not, painted, green, yet, these, suburbs, also, had, walls, and, gates, the, ottoman, sultans, took, a, keen, interest, in, the, prophet, s, mosque, and, redesigned, it, over, and, over, to, suit, their, preferences, as, the, ottomans, hold, over, their, domains, broke, loose, the, madanis, pledged, alliance, to, saud, bin, abdulaziz,
