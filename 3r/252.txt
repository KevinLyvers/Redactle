outer, edge, of, the, caribbean, plate, and, guadeloupe, is, part, of, the, outer, arc, of, the, lesser, antilles, volcanic, arc, many, of, the, islands, were, formed, as, a, result, of, the, subduction, of, oceanic, crust, of, the, atlantic, plate, under, the, caribbean, plate, in, the, lesser, antilles, subduction, zone, this, process, is, ongoing, and, is, responsible, for, volcanic, and, earthquake, activity, in, the, region, guadeloupe, was, formed, from, multiple, volcanoes, of, which, only, la, grande, soufri, re, is, not, extinct, its, last, eruption, was, in, 1976, and, led, to, the, evacuation, of, the, southern, part, of, basse, terre, 73, 600, people, were, displaced, throughout, three, and, a, half, months, following, the, eruption, k, ar, dating, indicates, that, the, three, northern, massifs, on, basse, terre, island, are, 2, 79, million, years, old, sections, of, volcanoes, collapsed, and, eroded, within, the, last, 650, 000, years, after, which, the, sans, toucher, volcano, grew, in, the, collapsed, area, volcanoes, in, the, north, of, basse, terre, island, mainly, produced, andesite, and, basaltic, andesite, there, are, several, beaches, of, dark, or, black, sand, la, d, sirade, east, of, the, main, islands, has, a, basement, from, the, mesozoic, overlaid, with, thick, limestones, from, the, pliocene, to, quaternary, periods, grande, terre, and, marie, galante, have, basements, probably, composed, of, volcanic, units, of, eocene, to, oligocene, but, there, are, no, visible, outcrops, on, grande, terre, the, overlying, carbonate, platform, is, 120, metres, thick, the, islands, are, part, of, the, leeward, islands, so, called, because, they, are, downwind, of, the, prevailing, trade, winds, which, blow, out, of, the, northeast, this, was, significant, in, the, days, of, sailing, ships, grande, terre, is, so, named, because, it, is, on, the, eastern, or, windward, side, exposed, to, the, atlantic, winds, basse, terre, is, so, named, because, it, is, on, the, leeward, south, west, side, and, sheltered, from, the, winds, guadeloupe, has, a, tropical, climate, tempered, by, maritime, influences, and, the, trade, winds, there, are, two, seasons, the, dry, season, called, lent, from, january, to, june, and, the, wet, season, called, winter, from, july, to, december, located, in, a, very, exposed, region, guadeloupe, and, its, dependencies, have, to, face, many, cyclones, the, deadliest, hurricane, to, hit, guadeloupe, was, the, pointe, pitre, hurricane, of, 1776, which, killed, at, least, 6, 000, people, in, 1989, hurricane, hugo, caused, severe, damage, to, the, islands, of, the, archipelago, and, left, a, deep, mark, on, the, memory, of, the, local, inhabitants, in, 1995, three, hurricanes, iris, luis, and, marilyn, hit, the, archipelago, in, less, than, three, weeks, other, notable, hurricanes, include, okeechobee, in, 1928, betsy, in, 1965, cleo, in, 1964, inez, in, 1966, and, irma, and, maria, in, 2017, with, fertile, volcanic, soils, heavy, rainfall, and, a, warm, climate, vegetation, on, basse, terre, is, lush, most, of, the, island, s, forests, are, on, basse, terre, containing, such, species, as, mahogany, ironwood, and, chestnut, trees, mangrove, swamps, line, the, sal, e, river, much, of, the, forest, on, grande, terre, has, been, cleared, with, only, a, few, small, patches, remaining, between, 300, and, 1, 000, metres, 980, and, 3, 280, ft, of, altitude, the, rainforest, that, covers, a, large, part, of, the, island, of, basse, terre, develops, vegetation, there, includes, the, white, gum, tree, the, acomat, boucan, or, chestnut, tree, the, marbri, or, bois, band, or, the, oleander, shrubs, and, herbaceous, plants, such, as, the, mountain, palm, the, balisier, or, ferns, many, epiphytes, bromeliads, philodendrons, orchids, and, lianas, above, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, the, humid, savannah, develops, composed, of, mosses, lichens, sphagnum, or, more, vigorous, plants, such, as, mountain, mangrove, high, altitude, violet, or, mountain, thyme, the, dry, forest, occupies, a, large, part, of, the, islands, of, grande, terre, marie, galante, les, saintes, la, d, sirade, and, also, develops, on, the, leeward, coast, of, basse, terre, the, coastal, forest, is, more, difficult, to, develop, because, of, the, nature, of, the, soil, sandy, rocky, salinity, sunshine, and, wind, and, is, the, environment, where, the, sea, grape, the, mancenilla, a, very, toxic, tree, whose, trunk, is, marked, with, a, red, line, the, icaquier, or, the, coconut, tree, grow, on, the, cliffs, and, in, the, arid, zones, are, found, cacti, such, as, the, cactus, cigar, cereus, the, prickly, pear, the, chestnut, cactus, the, t, te, l, anglais, cactus, and, the, aloes, the, mangrove, forest, that, borders, some, of, guadalupe, s, coasts, is, structured, in, three, levels, from, the, closest, to, the, sea, to, the, farthest, on, the, first, level, are, the, red, mangroves, on, the, second, about, 10, metres, 33, ft, from, the, sea, the, black, mangroves, form, the, shrubby, mangrove, on, the, third, level, the, white, mangroves, form, the, tall, mangrove, behind, the, mangrove, where, the, tide, and, salt, do, not, penetrate, a, swamp, forest, sometimes, develops, unique, in, guadeloupe, the, representative, species, of, this, environment, is, the, mangrove, medaille, few, terrestrial, mammals, aside, from, bats, and, raccoons, are, native, to, the, islands, the, introduced, javan, mongoose, is, also, present, on, guadeloupe, bird, species, include, the, endemic, purple, throated, carib, and, the, guadeloupe, woodpecker, the, waters, of, the, islands, support, a, rich, variety, of, marine, life, however, by, studying, 43, 000, bone, remains, from, six, islands, in, the, archipelago, it, was, found, that, 50, to, 70, of, snakes, and, lizards, on, the, guadeloupe, islands, became, extinct, after, european, colonists, arrived, they, had, brought, with, them, mammals, such, as, cats, mongooses, rats, and, raccoons, which, might, have, preyed, upon, the, native, reptiles, in, recent, decades, guadeloupe, s, natural, environments, have, been, affected, by, hunting, and, fishing, forest, retreat, urbanization, and, suburbanization, they, also, suffer, from, the, development, of, intensive, crops, banana, and, sugar, cane, in, particular, which, reached, their, peak, in, the, years, 1955, 75, this, has, led, to, the, following, situation, seagrass, beds, and, reefs, have, degraded, by, up, to, 50, around, the, large, islands, mangroves, and, mantids, have, almost, disappeared, in, marie, galante, les, saintes, and, la, d, sirade, the, salinity, of, the, fresh, water, table, has, increased, due, to, the, intensity, of, use, of, the, layer, and, pollution, of, agricultural, origin, pesticides, and, nitrogenous, compounds, in, addition, the, chleauterre, study, unveiled, in, march, 2018, concludes, that, 37, different, anthropogenic, molecules, more, than, half, of, which, come, from, residues, of, now, banned, pesticides, such, as, chlordecone, were, found, in, 79, of, the, watersheds, analyzed, in, grande, terre, and, 84, in, basse, terre, a, report, by, the, guadeloupe, water, office, notes, that, in, 2019, there, is, a, generalized, degradation, of, water, bodies, despite, everything, there, is, a, will, to, preserve, these, environments, whose, vegetation, and, landscape, are, preserved, in, some, parts, of, the, islands, and, constitute, a, sensitive, asset, for, tourism, these, areas, are, partially, protected, and, classified, as, znieff, sometimes, with, nature, reserve, status, and, several, caves, are, home, to, protected, chiropterans, the, guadalupe, national, park, was, created, on, 20, february, 1989, in, 1992, under, the, auspices, of, unesco, the, biosphere, reserve, of, the, guadeloupe, archipelago, r, serve, de, biosph, re, de, l, archipel, de, la, guadeloupe, was, created, as, a, result, on, 8, december, 1993, the, marine, site, of, grand, cul, de, sac, was, listed, as, a, wetland, of, international, importance, the, island, thus, became, the, overseas, department, with, the, most, protected, areas, the, archipelago, is, crossed, by, numerous, geological, faults, such, as, those, of, la, barre, or, la, cadoue, while, in, depth, in, front, of, moule, and, la, d, sirade, begins, the, d, sirade, fault, and, between, the, north, of, maria, galante, and, the, south, of, grande, terre, begins, the, maria, galante, fault, and, it, is, because, of, these, geological, characteristics, the, islands, of, the, department, of, guadeloupe, are, classified, in, zone, iii, according, to, the, seismic, zoning, of, france, and, are, subject, to, a, specific, risk, prevention, plan, the, 1843, earthquake, in, the, lesser, antilles, is, to, this, day, the, most, violent, earthquake, known, it, caused, the, death, of, more, than, a, thousand, people, as, well, as, major, damage, in, pointe, pitre, on, 21, november, 2004, the, islands, of, the, department, in, particular, les, saintes, archipelago, were, shaken, by, a, violent, earthquake, that, reached, a, magnitude, of, 6, 3, on, the, richter, scale, and, caused, the, death, of, one, person, as, well, as, extensive, material, damage, the, population, of, guadeloupe, was, estimated, to, be, 378, 561, on, 1, january, 2024, the, population, is, mainly, afro, caribbean, european, indian, tamil, telugu, and, other, south, indians, lebanese, syrians, and, chinese, are, all, minorities, there, is, also, a, substantial, population, of, haitians, in, guadeloupe, who, work, mainly, in, construction, and, as, street, vendors, basse, terre, is, the, political, capital, however, the, largest, city, and, economic, hub, is, pointe, pitre, the, population, of, guadeloupe, has, been, decreasing, by, 0, 8, per, year, since, 2013, in, 2017, the, average, population, density, in, guadeloupe, was, 240, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, 620, sq, mi, which, is, very, high, in, comparison, to, metropolitan, france, s, average, of, 119, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, 310, sq, mi, one, third, of, the, land, is, devoted, to, agriculture, and, all, mountains, are, uninhabitable, this, lack, of, space, and, shelter, makes, the, population, density, even, higher, the, most, populous, urban, unit, agglomeration, is, pointe, pitre, les, abymes, which, covers, 11, communes, and, 65, of, the, population, of, the, department, the, three, largest, urban, units, are, in, 2011, life, expectancy, at, birth, was, recorded, at, 77, 0, years, for, males, and, 83, 5, for, females, medical, centres, in, guadeloupe, include, university, hospital, centre, chu, in, pointe, pitre, regional, hospital, centre, chr, in, basse, terre, and, four, hospitals, located, in, capesterre, belle, eau, pointe, noire, bouillante, and, saint, claude, the, institut, pasteur, de, la, guadeloupe, is, located, in, pointe, pitre, and, is, responsible, for, researching, environmental, hygiene, vaccinations, and, the, spread, of, tuberculosis, and, other, mycobacteria, the, relative, wealth, of, guadeloupe, contrasts, with, the, extreme, poverty, of, several, islands, in, the, caribbean, region, which, makes, the, community, an, attractive, place, for, the, populations, of, some, of, these, territories, in, addition, other, factors, such, as, political, instability, and, natural, disasters, explain, this, immigration, as, early, as, the, 1970s, the, first, illegal, immigrants, of, haitian, origin, arrived, in, guadeloupe, to, meet, a, need, for, labour, in, the, agricultural, sector, alongside, this, haitian, immigration, which, is, more, visible, because, it, is, more, numerous, guadeloupe, has, also, seen, the, arrival, and, settlement, of, populations, from, the, island, of, dominica, and, the, dominican, republic, in, 2005, the, prefecture, which, represents, the, state, in, guadeloupe, reported, figures, of, between, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, foreigners, in, the, department, created, in, 1963, by, michel, debr, bumidom, s, objective, was, to,

as, a, result, of, the, need, for, all, ethnic, groups, french, african, and, amerindian, to, be, able, to, understand, each, other, this, language, is, therefore, the, result, of, a, mixture,

employed, in, the, houses, in, fact, the, latter, could, be, dressed, in, clothes, of, different, quality, according, to, the, job, they, performed, on, the, property, for, example, in, the, case, of, the, maids, their, clothes, could, be, of, better, quality, because, they, had, to, reflect, the, image, of, success, and, wealth, that, their, master, wanted, to, project, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, the, development, of, the, creole, costume, coincided, with, the, desire, of, slave, women, to, regain, their, dignity, with, the, evolution, of, their, employment, within, the, household,
