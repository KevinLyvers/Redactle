in, general, a, rural, area, or, a, countryside, is, a, geographic, area, that, is, located, outside, towns, and, cities, typical, rural, areas, have, a, low, population, density, and, small, settlements, agricultural, areas, and, areas, with, forestry, are, typically, described, as, rural, as, well, as, other, areas, lacking, substantial, development, different, countries, have, varying, definitions, of, rural, for, statistical, and, administrative, purposes, rural, areas, have, unique, economic, and, social, dynamics, due, to, their, relationship, with, land, based, industry, such, as, agriculture, forestry, and, resource, extraction, rural, economics, can, be, subject, to, boom, and, bust, cycles, and, vulnerable, to, extreme, weather, or, natural, disasters, such, as, droughts, these, dynamics, alongside, larger, economic, forces, encouraging, urbanization, have, led, to, significant, demographic, declines, called, rural, flight, where, economic, incentives, encourage, younger, populations, to, go, to, cities, for, education, and, access, to, jobs, leaving, older, less, educated, and, less, wealthy, populations, in, the, rural, areas, slower, economic, development, results, in, poorer, services, like, healthcare, education, and, infrastructure, this, cycle, of, poverty, contributes, to, why, three, quarters, of, the, global, impoverished, live, in, rural, areas, according, to, the, food, and, agricultural, organization, some, communities, have, successfully, encouraged, economic, development, in, rural, areas, with, policies, such, as, increased, access, to, electricity, or, internet, historically, development, policies, have, focused, on, larger, extractive, industries, such, as, mining, and, forestry, however, recent, approaches, more, focused, on, sustainable, development, take, into, account, economic, diversification, in, these, communities, in, canada, the, organization, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, defines, a, predominantly, rural, region, as, having, more, than, 50, of, the, population, living, in, rural, communities, where, a, rural, community, has, a, population, density, less, than, 150, people, per, square, kilometre, in, canada, the, census, division, has, been, used, to, represent, regions, and, census, consolidated, sub, divisions, have, been, used, to, represent, communities, intermediate, regions, have, 15, to, 49, percent, of, their, population, living, in, a, rural, community, predominantly, urban, regions, have, less, than, 15, percent, of, their, population, living, in, a, rural, community, predominantly, rural, regions, are, classified, as, rural, metro, adjacent, rural, non, metro, adjacent, and, rural, northern, following, philip, ehrensaft, and, jennifer, beeman, 1992, rural, metro, adjacent, regions, are, predominantly, rural, census, divisions, which, are, adjacent, to, metropolitan, centres, while, rural, non, metro, adjacent, regions, are, those, predominantly, rural, census, divisions, which, are, not, adjacent, to, metropolitan, centres, rural, northern, regions, are, predominantly, rural, census, divisions, that, are, found, either, entirely, or, mostly, above, the, following, lines, of, latitude, in, each, province, newfoundland, and, labrador, 50th, manitoba, 53rd, alberta, british, columbia, ontario, quebec, and, saskatchewan, 54th, as, well, rural, northern, regions, encompass, all, of, the, yukon, northwest, territories, and, nunavut, statistics, canada, defines, rural, areas, by, their, population, counts, this, has, referred, to, the, population, living, outside, settlements, of, 1, 000, or, fewer, inhabitants, the, current, definition, states, that, census, rural, is, the, population, outside, settlements, with, fewer, than, 1, 000, inhabitants, and, a, population, density, below, 400, people, per, square, kilometre, rural, areas, in, the, united, states, often, referred, to, as, rural, america, consists, of, approximately, 97, of, the, united, states, land, area, an, estimated, 60, million, people, or, one, in, five, residents, 17, 9, of, the, total, u, s, population, live, in, rural, america, definitions, vary, from, different, parts, of, the, united, states, government, as, to, what, constitutes, those, areas, in, brazil, there, are, different, notions, of, rural, area, and, countryside, rural, areas, are, any, place, outside, a, municipality, s, urban, development, buildings, streets, and, it, is, carried, by, informal, usage, otherwise, countryside, interior, in, portuguese, are, officially, defined, as, all, municipalities, outside, the, state, territory, capital, s, metropolitan, region, some, states, as, mato, grosso, do, sul, do, not, have, any, metropolitan, regions, thus, all, of, the, state, except, its, capital, is, officially, countryside, rio, de, janeiro, is, singular, in, brazil, and, it, is, de, facto, a, metropolitan, state, as, circa, 70, of, its, population, are, located, in, greater, rio, in, the, federal, district, it, is, not, applicable, and, there, is, no, countryside, as, all, of, it, is, treated, as, the, federal, capital, bras, lia, is, nominally, the, capital, but, the, capitality, is, shared, through, all, federal, district, because, brazil, de, facto, defines, its, capital, as, a, municipality, and, in, municipal, matters, the, federal, district, is, treated, and, governs, as, a, single, municipality, city, state, like, bras, lia, df, 15, of, the, french, population, lives, in, rural, areas, spread, over, 90, of, the, country, the, government, under, president, emmanuel, macron, launched, an, action, plan, in, 2019, amid, the, yellow, vests, movement, in, favor, of, rural, areas, named, the, agenda, rural, among, many, initiatives, recommended, to, redynamize, rural, areas, energy, transition, is, one, of, them, research, is, being, carried, out, to, assess, the, impact, of, new, projects, in, rural, areas, in, 2018, the, government, had, launched, the, action, c, ur, de, ville, program, to, revitalize, town, centers, across, the, country, 222, towns, were, selected, as, part, of, the, five, year, program, one, of, the, program, s, aims, is, to, make, the, towns, attractive, so, the, areas, nearby, can, also, benefit, from, investments, germany, is, divided, into, 402, administrative, districts, 295, rural, districts, and, 107, urban, districts, as, one, of, the, largest, agricultural, producers, in, the, european, union, more, than, half, of, germany, s, territory, which, is, almost, 19, million, hectares, is, used, for, farming, and, located, in, the, rural, areas, almost, 10, of, people, in, germany, have, jobs, related, to, the, agricultural, forest, and, fisheries, sectors, approximately, a, fifth, of, them, are, employed, in, the, primary, production, since, there, is, a, policy, of, equal, living, conditions, people, see, rural, areas, as, equivalent, as, urban, areas, village, renewal, is, an, approach, to, develop, countryside, and, supports, the, challenges, faced, in, the, process, of, it, in, britain, there, are, various, definitions, of, a, rural, area, rural, is, defined, by, the, uk, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, defra, using, population, data, from, the, latest, census, such, as, the, united, kingdom, census, 2001, these, definitions, have, various, grades, but, the, upper, point, is, any, local, government, area, with, more, than, 26, of, its, population, living, in, a, rural, settlement, or, market, town, market, town, being, defined, as, any, settlement, which, has, permission, to, hold, a, street, market, a, number, of, measures, are, in, place, to, protect, the, british, countryside, including, green, belts, rural, areas, are, also, known, as, the, countryside, or, a, village, in, india, it, has, a, very, low, population, density, in, rural, areas, agriculture, is, the, chief, source, of, livelihood, along, with, fishing, cottage, industries, pottery, etc, almost, every, indian, economic, agency, today, has, its, own, definition, of, rural, india, some, of, which, follow, according, to, the, planning, commission, a, town, with, a, maximum, population, of, 15, 000, is, considered, rural, in, nature, in, these, areas, the, panchayat, makes, all, the, decisions, there, are, five, people, in, the, panchayat, the, national, sample, survey, organization, nsso, defines, rural, as, follows, rbi, defines, rural, areas, as, those, areas, with, a, population, of, less, than, 49, 000, tier, 3, to, tier, 6, cities, it, is, generally, said, that, the, rural, areas, house, up, to, 70, of, india, s, population, rural, india, contributes, a, large, chunk, to, india, s, gdp, by, way, of, agriculture, self, employment, services, construction, etc, as, per, a, strict, measure, used, by, the, national, sample, survey, in, its, 63rd, round, called, monthly, per, capita, expenditure, rural, expenditure, accounts, for, 55, of, total, national, monthly, expenditure, the, rural, population, currently, accounts, for, one, third, of, the, total, indian, fmcg, sales, in, japan, rural, areas, are, referred, to, as, inaka, which, translates, literally, to, the, countryside, or, one, s, native, village, according, to, the, 2017, census, about, 64, of, pakistanis, live, in, rural, areas, most, rural, areas, in, pakistan, tend, to, be, near, cities, and, are, peri, urban, areas, this, is, due, to, the, definition, of, a, rural, area, in, pakistan, being, an, area, that, does, not, come, within, an, urban, boundary, rural, areas, in, pakistan, that, are, near, cities, are, considered, as, suburban, areas, or, suburbs, the, remote, rural, villagers, of, pakistan, commonly, live, in, houses, made, of, bricks, clay, or, mud, socioeconomic, status, among, rural, pakistani, villagers, is, often, based, upon, the, ownership, of, agricultural, land, which, also, may, provide, social, prestige, in, village, cultures, the, majority, of, rural, pakistani, inhabitants, livelihoods, is, based, upon, the, rearing, of, livestock, which, also, comprises, a, significant, part, of, pakistan, s, gross, domestic, product, some, livestock, raised, by, rural, pakistanis, include, cattle, and, goats, in, new, zealand, census, areas, are, classified, based, on, their, degree, of, rurality, however, traffic, law, has, a, different, interpretation, and, defines, a, rural, area, as, a, road, or, a, geographical, area, that, is, not, an, urban, traffic, area, to, which, the, rural, speed, limit, generally, applies, rural, economics, is, the, study, of, rural, economies, rural, economies, include, both, agricultural, and, non, agricultural, industries, so, rural, economics, has, broader, concerns, than, agricultural, economics, which, focus, more, on, food, systems, rural, development, and, finance, attempt, to, solve, larger, challenges, within, rural, economics, these, economic, issues, are, often, connected, to, the, migration, from, rural, areas, due, to, lack, of, economic, activities, and, rural, poverty, some, interventions, have, been, very, successful, in, some, parts, of, the, world, with, rural, electrification, and, rural, tourism, providing, anchors, for, transforming, economies, in, some, rural, areas, these, challenges, often, create, rural, urban, income, disparities, rural, development, is, the, process, of, improving, the, quality, of, life, and, economic, well, being, of, people, living, in, rural, areas, often, relatively, isolated, and, sparsely, populated, areas, often, rural, regions, have, experienced, rural, poverty, poverty, greater, than, urban, or, suburban, economic, regions, due, to, lack, of, access, to, economic, activities, and, lack, of, investments, in, key, infrastructure, such, as, education, rural, development, has, traditionally, centered, on, the, exploitation, of, land, intensive, natural, resources, such, as, agriculture, and, forestry, however, changes, in, global, production, networks, and, increased, urbanization, have, changed, the, character, of, rural, areas, increasingly, rural, tourism, niche, manufacturers, and, recreation, have, replaced, resource, extraction, and, agriculture, as, dominant, economic, drivers, the, need, for, rural, communities, to, approach, development, from, a, wider, perspective, has, created, more, focus, on, a, broad, range, of, development, goals, rather, than, merely, creating, incentive, for, agricultural, or, resource, based, businesses, rural, electrification, is, the, process, of, bringing, electrical, power, to, rural, and, remote, areas, rural, communities, are, suffering, from, colossal, market, failures, as, the, national, grids, fall, short, of, their, demand, for, electricity, as, of, 2019, 770, million, people, live, without, access, to, electricity, 10, 2, of, the, global, population, electrification, typically, begins, in, cities, and, towns, and, gradually, extends, to, rural, areas, however, this, process, often, runs, into, obstacles, in, developing, nations, expanding, the, national, grid, is, expensive, and, countries, consistently, lack, the, capital, to, grow, their, current, infrastructure, additionally, amortizing, capital, costs, to, reduce, the, unit, cost, of, each, hook, up, is, harder, to, do, in, lightly, populated, areas, yielding, higher, per, capita, share, of, the, expense, if, countries, are, able, to, overcome, these, obstacles, and, reach, nationwide, electrification, rural, communities, will, be, able, to, reap, considerable, amounts, of, economic, and, social, development, rural, flight, also, known, as, rural, to, urban, migration, rural, depopulation, or, rural, exodus, is, the, migratory, pattern, of, people, from, rural, areas, into, urban, areas, it, is, urbanization, seen, from, the, rural, perspective, in, industrializing, economies, like, britain, in, the, eighteenth, century, or, east, asia, in, the, twentieth, century, it, can, occur, following, the, industrialization, of, primary, industries, such, as, agriculture, mining, fishing, and, forestry, when, fewer, people, are, needed, to, bring, the, same, amount, of, output, to, market, and, related, secondary, industries, refining, and, processing, are, consolidated, rural, exodus, can, also, follow, an, ecological, or, human, caused, catastrophe, such, as, a, famine, or, resource, depletion, these, are, examples, of, push, factors, the, same, phenomenon, can, also, be, brought, about, simply, because, of, higher, wages, and, educational, access, available, in, urban, areas, examples, of, pull, factors, once, rural, populations, fall, below, a, critical, mass, the, population, is, too, small, to, support, certain, businesses, which, then, also, leave, or, close, in, a, vicious, circle, even, in, non, market, sectors, of, the, economy, providing, services, to, smaller, and, more, dispersed, populations, becomes, proportionately, more, expensive, for, governments, which, can, lead, to, closures, of, state, funded, offices, and, services, which, further, harm, the, rural, economy, schools, are, the, archetypal, example, because, they, influence, the, decisions, of, parents, of, young, children, a, village, or, region, without, a, school, will, typically, lose, families, to, larger, towns, that, have, one, but, the, concept, urban, hierarchy, can, be, applied, more, generally, to, many, services, and, is, explained, by, central, place, theory, rural, poverty, refers, to, situations, where, people, living, in, non, urban, regions, are, in, a, state, or, condition, of, lacking, the, financial, resources, and, essentials, for, living, it, takes, account, of, factors, of, rural, society, rural, economy, and, political, systems, that, give, rise, to, the, marginalization, and, economic, disadvantage, found, there, rural, areas, because, of, their, small, spread, out, populations, typically, have, less, well, maintained, infrastructure, and, a, harder, time, accessing, markets, which, tend, to, be, concentrated, in, population, centers, rural, communities, also, face, disadvantages, in, terms, of, legal, and, social, protections, with, women, and, marginalized, communities, frequently, having, a, harder, time, accessing, land, education, and, other, support, systems, that, help, with, economic, development, several, policies, have, been, tested, in, both, developing, and, developed, economies, including, rural, electrification, and, access, to, other, technologies, such, as, internet, gender, parity, and, improved, access, to, credit, and, income, in, academic, studies, rural, poverty, is, often, discussed, in, conjunction, with, spatial, inequality, which, in, this, context, refers, to, the, inequality, between, urban, and, rural, areas, both, rural, poverty, and, spatial, inequality, are, global, phenomena, but, like, poverty, in, general, there, are, higher, rates, of, rural, poverty, in, developing, countries, than, in, developed, countries, eradicating, rural, poverty, through, effective, policies, and, economic, growth, is, a, continuing, difficulty, for, the, international, community, as, it, invests, in, rural, development, according, to, the, international, fund, for, agricultural, development, 70, percent, of, the, people, in, extreme, poverty, are, in, rural, areas, most, of, whom, are, smallholders, or, agricultural, workers, whose, livelihoods, are, heavily, dependent, on, agriculture, these, food, systems, are, vulnerable, to, extreme, weather, which, is, expected, to, affect, agricultural, systems, the, world, over, more, as, climate, change, increases, in, medicine, rural, health, or, rural, medicine, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, health, and, health, care, delivery, in, rural, environments, the, concept, of, rural, health, incorporates, many, fields, including, wilderness, medicine, geography, midwifery, nursing, sociology, economics, and, telehealth, or, telemedicine, rural, populations, often, experience, health, disparities, and, greater, barriers, in, access, to, healthcare, compared, to, urban, populations, globally, rural, populations, face, increased, burdens, of, noncommunicable, diseases, such, as, cardiovascular, disease, cancer, diabetes, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disorder, contributing, to, worse, health, outcomes, and, higher, mortality, rates, factors, contributing, to, these, health, disparities, include, remote, geography, increased, rates, of, health, risk, behaviors, lower, population, density, decreased, health, insurance, coverage, among, the, population, lack, of, health, infrastructure, and, work, force, demographics, people, living, in, rural, areas, also, tend, to, have, less, education, lower, socioeconomic, status, and, higher, rates, of, alcohol, and, smoking, when, compared, to, their, urban, counterparts, additionally, the, rate, of, poverty, is, higher, in, rural, populations, globally, contributing, to, health, disparities, due, to, an, inability, to, access, healthy, foods, healthcare, and, housing, because, of, their, unique, dynamics, different, academic, fields, have, developed, to, study, rural, communities, rural, economics, is, the, study, of, rural, economies, rural, economies, include, both, agricultural, and, non, agricultural, industries, so, rural, economics, has, broader, concerns, than, agricultural, economics, which, focus, more, on, food, systems, rural, development, and, finance, attempt, to, solve, larger, challenges, within, rural, economics, these, economic, issues, are, often, connected, to, the, migration, from, rural, areas, due, to, lack, of, economic, activities, and, rural, poverty, some, interventions, have, been, very, successful, in, some, parts, of, the, world, with, rural, electrification, and, rural, tourism, providing, anchors, for, transforming, economies, in, some, rural, areas, these, challenges, often, create, rural, urban, income, disparities, rural, planning, is, an, academic, discipline, that, exists, within, or, alongside, the, field, of, urban, planning, regional, planning, or, urbanism, the, definition, of, these, fields, differs, between, languages, and, contexts, sometimes, the, terms, are, used, interchangeably, specific, interventions, and, solutions, will, depend, entirely, on, the, needs, of, each, region, in, each, country, but, generally, speaking, regional, planning, at, the, macro, level, will, seek, to, 1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, rural, sociology, is, a, field, of, sociology, traditionally, associated, with, the, study, of, social, structure, and, conflict, in, rural, areas, it, is, an, active, academic, field, in, much, of, the, world, originating, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1910s, with, close, ties, to, the, national, department, of, agriculture, and, land, grant, university, colleges, of, agriculture
