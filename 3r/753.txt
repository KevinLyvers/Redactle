https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto
a, ghetto, is, a, part, of, a, city, in, which, members, of, a, minority, group, are, concentrated, especially, as, a, result, of, political, social, legal, religious, environmental, or, economic, pressure, ghettos, are, often, known, for, being, more, impoverished, than, other, areas, of, the, city, versions, of, such, restricted, areas, have, been, found, across, the, world, each, with, their, own, names, classifications, and, groupings, of, people, the, term, was, originally, used, for, the, venetian, ghetto, in, venice, italy, as, early, as, 1516, to, describe, the, part, of, the, city, where, jewish, people, were, restricted, to, live, and, thus, segregated, from, other, people, however, other, early, societies, may, have, formed, their, own, versions, of, the, same, structure, words, resembling, ghetto, in, meaning, appear, in, hebrew, yiddish, italian, germanic, old, french, and, latin, during, the, holocaust, more, than, 1, 000, nazi, ghettos, were, established, to, hold, the, jewish, populations, of, europe, with, the, goal, of, exploiting, and, killing, european, jews, as, part, of, the, final, solution, of, nazi, germany, the, term, ghetto, acquired, deep, cultural, meaning, in, the, united, states, especially, in, the, context, of, segregation, and, civil, rights, it, has, been, widely, used, in, the, country, since, the, 20th, century, to, refer, to, poor, neighborhoods, of, largely, minority, populations, it, is, also, used, in, some, european, countries, such, as, romania, and, slovakia, to, refer, to, poor, neighborhoods, the, term, slum, is, usually, used, to, refer, to, areas, in, developing, countries, that, suffer, from, absolute, poverty, while, the, term, ghetto, is, used, to, refer, to, areas, of, developed, countries, that, suffer, from, relative, poverty, the, word, ghetto, comes, from, the, jewish, area, of, venice, the, venetian, ghetto, in, cannaregio, 1516, 1797, by, 1899, the, term, had, been, extended, to, crowded, urban, quarters, of, other, minority, groups, the, etymology, of, the, word, is, uncertain, as, there, is, no, agreement, among, etymologists, about, the, origins, of, the, venetian, language, term, as, it, pertains, to, a, neighborhood, one, theory, of, the, word, can, be, traced, to, a, special, use, of, the, venetian, gh, to, meaning, foundry, there, was, one, near, the, site, of, that, city, s, ghetto, when, it, was, founded, in, 1516, according, to, various, other, theories, it, comes, from, another, possibility, is, from, the, italian, egitto, egypt, from, latin, aegyptus, possibly, in, memory, of, the, exile, of, the, israelites, in, egypt, the, character, of, ghettos, has, varied, through, times, the, term, was, used, for, an, area, known, as, the, jewish, quarter, which, meant, the, area, of, a, city, traditionally, inhabited, by, jews, in, the, diaspora, jewish, quarters, like, the, jewish, ghettos, in, europe, were, often, the, outgrowths, of, segregated, ghettos, instituted, by, the, surrounding, authorities, a, yiddish, term, for, a, jewish, quarter, or, neighborhood, is, di, yidishe, gas, yiddish, or, the, jewish, street, many, european, and, middle, eastern, cities, once, had, a, historical, jewish, quarter, jewish, ghettos, in, christian, europe, existed, because, of, majority, discrimination, against, jews, on, the, basis, of, religion, language, and, dated, views, on, race, they, were, considered, outsiders, as, a, result, jews, were, placed, under, strict, regulations, throughout, many, european, cities, in, some, cases, the, ghetto, was, a, jewish, quarter, with, a, relatively, affluent, population, for, instance, the, jewish, ghetto, in, venice, in, other, cases, ghettos, were, places, of, terrible, poverty, during, periods, of, population, growth, ghettos, as, that, of, rome, had, narrow, streets, and, tall, crowded, houses, residents, generally, were, allowed, to, administer, their, own, justice, system, based, on, jewish, traditions, and, elders, during, world, war, ii, the, nazis, established, new, ghettos, in, numerous, cities, of, eastern, europe, as, a, form, of, concentration, camp, to, confine, jews, and, romani, into, limited, areas, the, nazis, most, often, referred, to, these, areas, in, documents, and, signage, at, their, entrances, as, jewish, quarter, these, nazi, camps, sometimes, coincided, with, traditional, jewish, ghettos, and, jewish, quarters, but, not, always, on, june, 21, 1943, heinrich, himmler, issued, a, decree, ordering, the, dissolution, of, all, j, dische, wohnbezirke, ghettos, in, the, east, and, their, transference, to, nazi, concentration, camps, or, their, extermination, the, nazi, ghettos, were, an, essentially, different, institution, than, the, historical, ghettos, of, european, society, the, historical, ghettos, were, places, where, jews, lived, for, many, generations, and, created, their, own, culture, even, if, they, were, under, social, and, political, conditions, of, segregation, and, discrimination, the, nazi, ghettos, were, part, of, the, final, solution, they, were, intended, as, a, transitional, stage, first, confine, each, city, s, jews, in, one, easily, accessible, and, controllable, location, then, liquidate, the, ghetto, and, send, the, jews, to, an, extermination, camp, most, nazi, ghettos, were, liquidated, in, 1943, some, such, as, that, of, d, persisted, until, 1944, very, few, e, g, the, budapest, ghetto, and, the, theresienstadt, ghetto, existed, until, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1945, a, mellah, is, a, walled, jewish, quarter, of, a, city, in, morocco, an, analogue, of, the, european, ghetto, jewish, populations, were, confined, to, mellahs, in, morocco, beginning, from, the, 15th, century, after, the, expulsion, of, jews, and, muslims, from, iberia, and, especially, since, the, early, 19th, century, in, cities, a, mellah, was, surrounded, by, a, wall, with, a, fortified, gateway, usually, the, jewish, quarter, was, situated, near, the, royal, palace, or, the, residence, of, the, governor, in, order, to, protect, its, inhabitants, from, recurring, riots, in, contrast, rural, mellahs, were, separate, villages, inhabited, solely, by, the, jews, before, and, during, world, war, ii, many, jews, fled, from, german, occupied, europe, to, shanghai, after, japan, invaded, china, it, established, the, shanghai, ghetto, an, area, of, approximately, one, square, mile, 2, 6, km, 2, in, the, hongkou, district, of, the, empire, of, japan, to, which, it, relocated, about, 20, 000, jewish, refugees, under, its, proclamation, concerning, restriction, of, residence, and, business, of, stateless, refugees, the, development, of, ghettos, in, the, united, states, is, closely, associated, with, different, waves, of, immigration, and, internal, urban, migration, the, irish, and, german, immigrants, of, the, mid, 19th, century, were, the, first, ethnic, groups, to, form, ethnic, enclaves, in, united, states, cities, this, was, followed, by, large, numbers, of, immigrants, from, southern, and, eastern, europe, including, many, italians, and, poles, and, russians, between, 1880, and, 1920, jewish, immigrants, were, part, of, the, earliest, german, wave, as, well, as, comprising, numerous, immigrants, from, eastern, europe, the, russian, empire, at, the, time, most, remained, in, their, established, immigrant, communities, but, by, the, second, or, third, generation, many, families, were, able, to, relocate, to, newer, housing, built, in, the, suburbs, after, world, war, ii, these, ethnic, ghetto, areas, included, the, lower, east, side, in, manhattan, new, york, which, later, became, notable, as, predominantly, jewish, and, later, still, as, chinese, and, latino, east, harlem, was, once, predominantly, italian, and, in, the, 1950s, became, home, to, a, large, puerto, rican, community, little, italys, across, the, country, were, predominantly, italian, ghettos, many, polish, immigrants, settled, in, areas, of, other, nationals, such, as, pilsen, of, chicago, and, polish, hill, of, pittsburgh, since, the, late, 20th, century, brighton, beach, in, brooklyn, has, become, the, home, of, predominately, jewish, russian, and, ukrainian, immigrants, who, left, after, the, soviet, union, lifted, some, migration, restrictions, and, later, after, its, fall, a, commonly, used, definition, of, a, ghetto, is, a, community, distinguished, by, a, homogeneous, race, or, ethnicity, additionally, a, key, feature, that, developed, throughout, the, post, industrial, era, and, continues, to, symbolize, the, demographics, of, american, ghettos, is, the, prevalence, of, poverty, poverty, constitutes, the, separation, of, ghettos, from, other, suburbanized, or, private, neighborhoods, the, high, percentage, of, poverty, partly, justifies, the, difficulty, of, emigration, which, tends, to, reproduce, constraining, social, opportunities, and, inequalities, in, society, the, term, ghettos, has, been, commonly, used, for, some, time, but, ghettos, were, around, long, before, the, term, was, coined, urban, areas, in, the, u, s, can, often, be, classified, as, black, or, white, with, the, inhabitants, primarily, belonging, to, a, homogenous, racial, grouping, this, classification, can, be, traced, back, as, early, as, the, year, 1880, as, african, americans, were, living, in, their, own, neighborhoods, sixty, years, after, the, american, civil, rights, movement, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, most, of, the, united, states, remains, a, residentially, segregated, society, in, which, black, people, and, white, people, inhabit, different, neighborhoods, of, significantly, different, quality, many, of, these, neighborhoods, are, located, in, northern, and, western, cities, where, african, americans, moved, during, the, great, migration, 1914, 1970, a, period, when, over, a, million, african, americans, moved, out, of, the, rural, southern, united, states, to, escape, the, widespread, racism, of, the, south, to, seek, out, employment, opportunities, in, industrial, cities, and, to, pursue, what, was, widely, perceived, to, be, a, better, quality, of, life, in, the, north, and, west, such, as, new, york, city, detroit, cleveland, chicago, pittsburgh, los, angeles, oakland, portland, and, seattle, african, americans, found, they, had, to, struggle, with, white, ethnic, groups, in, northern, and, midwestern, cities, many, of, them, more, recent, european, immigrants, often, they, were, restricted, to, areas, of, older, and, poor, housing, in, the, new, cities, where, they, settled, the, social, disruption, and, economic, competition, following, world, war, i, as, veterans, returned, to, the, us, resulted, in, an, outbreak, of, racial, violence, of, whites, against, blacks, in, many, of, these, northern, cities, such, as, chicago, omaha, washington, dc, and, others, southern, industrial, cities, were, also, affected, such, racist, attacks, were, extremely, violent, in, some, cases, they, included, burning, or, bombing, homes, of, african, americans, many, innocent, blacks, were, killed, african, american, leaders, described, 1919, as, the, red, summer, because, of, the, widespread, racial, outbreaks, and, white, attacks, on, mainly, african, americans, two, main, factors, ensured, further, separation, between, races, and, classes, and, ultimately, the, development, of, contemporary, ghettos, the, relocation, of, industrial, enterprises, and, the, movement, of, middle, to, upper, class, residents, into, suburban, neighborhoods, between, 1967, and, 1987, economic, restructuring, resulted, in, a, dramatic, decline, of, manufacturing, jobs, which, had, formerly, provided, good, livings, for, unionized, working, class, blacks, and, whites, the, once, thriving, northern, and, western, industrial, cities, survived, by, a, gradual, shift, to, service, and, financial, occupations, subsidized, highways, and, suburban, development, in, the, postwar, period, had, pulled, many, middle, and, upper, class, families, and, related, businesses, to, the, suburbs, those, who, could, not, afford, to, move, were, left, with, disrupted, neighborhoods, and, economies, in, the, inner, cities, african, americans, were, disproportionately, affected, and, became, either, unemployed, or, underemployed, with, little, wage, and, reduced, benefits, a, concentration, of, african, americans, predominated, in, some, inner, city, neighborhoods, it, is, also, significant, to, compare, the, demographic, patterns, between, black, people, and, european, immigrants, according, to, the, labor, market, european, immigrants, and, african, americans, were, both, subject, to, an, ethnic, division, of, labor, because, of, discrimination, african, americans, were, often, restricted, to, the, least, secure, division, of, the, labor, market, david, ward, refers, to, this, stagnant, position, in, african, american, or, black, ghettos, as, the, elevator, model, which, implies, that, each, group, of, immigrants, or, migrants, takes, turns, in, the, processes, of, social, mobility, and, suburbanization, and, several, groups, did, not, start, on, the, ground, floor, the, inability, of, black, people, to, move, from, the, ground, floor, as, ward, suggests, is, dependent, upon, prejudice, and, segregationist, patterns, established, in, the, south, prior, to, world, war, i, where, most, african, americans, were, disenfranchised, by, the, turn, of, the, century, and, deprived, of, political, power, after, the, exodus, of, african, americans, to, the, north, during, and, after, world, war, i, they, had, to, compete, with, numerous, european, immigrants, thus, african, americans, were, diminished, to, unskilled, jobs, the, slow, rate, of, advancement, in, black, communities, outlines, the, rigidity, of, the, labor, market, competition, and, conflict, adding, another, dimension, to, the, prevalence, of, poverty, and, social, instability, in, african, american, or, black, ghettos, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, many, white, americans, began, to, move, away, from, inner, cities, to, newer, suburban, communities, a, process, known, as, white, flight, white, flight, occurred, in, part, as, a, response, to, black, people, moving, into, white, urban, neighborhoods, discriminatory, practices, especially, those, intended, to, preserve, emerging, white, suburbs, restricted, the, ability, of, black, people, to, move, from, inner, cities, to, the, suburbs, even, when, they, were, economically, able, to, afford, it, in, contrast, to, this, the, same, period, in, history, marked, a, massive, suburban, expansion, available, primarily, to, whites, of, both, wealthy, and, working, class, backgrounds, facilitated, through, highway, construction, and, the, availability, of, federally, subsidized, home, mortgages, va, fha, home, owners, loan, corporation, these, made, it, easier, for, families, to, buy, new, houses, in, the, suburbs, but, not, to, rent, apartments, in, cities, the, united, states, began, restructuring, its, economy, after, world, war, ii, fueled, by, new, globalizing, processes, and, demonstrated, through, technological, advances, and, improvements, in, efficiency, the, structural, shift, of, 1973, during, the, post, fordist, era, became, a, large, component, to, the, racial, ghetto, and, its, relationship, with, the, labor, market, sharon, zukin, declares, the, designated, stratum, of, african, americans, in, the, labor, force, was, placed, even, below, the, working, class, low, skill, urban, jobs, were, now, given, to, incoming, immigrants, from, mexico, or, the, caribbean, additionally, zukin, notes, not, only, have, social, services, been, drastically, reduced, punitive, and, other, social, controls, over, the, poor, have, been, increased, such, as, law, enforcement, and, imprisonment, 514, described, as, the, urban, crisis, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, transition, stressed, regional, divisions, according, to, differences, in, income, and, racial, lines, white, donuts, around, black, holes, hardly, coincidental, the, steady, separation, occurred, during, the, period, of, civil, rights, laws, urban, riots, and, black, power, in, addition, the, international, encyclopedia, of, social, sciences, stresses, the, various, challenges, developed, by, this, urban, crisis, including, 313, oorly, underserviced, infrastructures, inadequate, housing, to, accommodate, a, growing, urban, populace, group, conflict, and, competition, over, limited, jobs, and, space, the, inability, for, many, residents, to, compete, for, new, technology, based, jobs, and, tensions, between, the, public, and, private, sectors, left, to, the, formation, and, growth, of, u, s, ghettos, the, cumulative, economic, and, social, forces, in, ghettos, give, way, to, social, political, and, economic, isolation, and, inequality, while, indirectly, defining, a, separation, between, superior, and, inferior, status, of, groups, in, response, to, the, influx, of, black, people, from, the, south, banks, insurance, companies, and, businesses, began, denying, or, increasing, the, cost, of, services, such, as, banking, insurance, access, to, jobs, access, to, health, care, or, even, supermarkets, to, residents, in, certain, often, racially, determined, areas, the, most, devastating, form, of, redlining, and, the, most, common, use, of, the, term, refers, to, mortgage, discrimination, data, on, house, prices, and, attitudes, toward, integration, suggest, that, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, segregation, was, a, product, of, collective, actions, taken, by, non, black, people, to, exclude, black, people, from, outside, neighborhoods, the, racial, provisions, of, the, fha, underwriting, manual, of, 1936, included, the, following, guidelines, which, exacerbated, the, segregation, issue, recommended, restrictions, should, include, provision, for, prohibition, of, the, occupancy, of, properties, except, by, the, race, for, which, they, are, intended, schools, should, be, appropriate, to, the, needs, of, the, new, community, and, they, should, not, be, attended, in, large, numbers, by, inharmonious, racial, groups, this, meant, that, ethnic, minorities, could, secure, mortgage, loans, only, in, certain, areas, and, it, resulted, in, a, large, increase, in, the, residential, racial, segregation, and, urban, decay, in, the, united, states, the, creation, of, new, highways, in, some, cases, divided, and, isolated, black, neighborhoods, from, goods, and, services, many, times, within, industrial, corridors, for, example, birmingham, alabama, s, interstate, highway, system, attempted, to, maintain, the, racial, boundaries, that, had, been, established, by, the, city, s, 1926, racial, zoning, law, the, construction, of, interstate, highways, through, black, neighborhoods, in, the, city, led, to, significant, population, loss, in, those, neighborhoods, and, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, neighborhood, racial, segregation, residential, segregation, was, further, perpetuated, because, whites, were, willing, to, pay, more, than, black, people, to, live, in, predominantly, white, areas, some, social, scientists, suggest, that, the, historical, processes, of, suburbanization, and, decentralization, are, instances, of, white, privilege, that, have, contributed, to, contemporary, patterns, of, environmental, racism, following, the, emergence, of, anti, discrimination, policies, in, housing, and, labor, sparked, by, the, civil, rights, movement, members, of, the, black, middle, class, moved, out, of, the, ghetto, the, fair, housing, act, was, passed, in, 1968, this, was, the, first, federal, law, that, outlawed, discrimination, in, the, sale, and, rental, of, housing, on, the, basis, of, race, color, national, origin, religion, and, later, sex, familial, status, and, disability, the, office, of, fair, housing, and, equal, opportunity, was, charged, with, administering, and, enforcing, the, law, since, housing, discrimination, became, illegal, new, housing, opportunities, were, made, available, to, the, black, community, and, many, left, the, ghetto, urban, sociologists, frequently, title, this, historical, event, as, black, middle, class, exodus, or, black, flight, elijah, anderson, describes, a, process, by, which, members, of, the, black, middle, class, begin, to, distance, themselves, socially, and, culturally, from, ghetto, residents, during, the, later, half, of, the, twentieth, century, eventually, expressing, this, distance, by, literally, moving, away, this, is, followed, by, the, exodus, of, black, working, class, families, 49, as, a, result, the, ghetto, becomes, primarily, occupied, by, what, sociologists, and, journalists, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, frequently, title, the, underclass, william, julius, wilson, suggests, this, exodus, worsened, the, isolation, of, the, black, underclass, not, only, were, they, socially, and, physically, distanced, from, whites, they, also, became, isolated, from, the, black, middle, class, 7, 8, two, dominant, theories, arise, pertaining, to, the, production, and, development, of, u, s, ghettos, race, based, and, class, based, as, well, as, an, alternative, theory, put, forward, by, thomas, sowell, first, are, the, race, based, theorists, who, argue, the, importance, of, race, in, ghettos, their, analysis, consists, of, the, dominant, racial, group, in, the, u, s, white, anglo, saxon, protestants, and, their, use, of, certain, racist, tactics, in, order, to, maintain, their, hegemony, over, black, people, and, lengthen, their, spatial, separation, race, based, theorists, offset, other, arguments, that, focus, on, the, influence, of, the, economy, on, segregation, more, contemporary, research, of, race, based, theorists, is, to, frame, a, range, of, methods, conducted, by, white, americans, to, preserve, race, based, residential, inequities, as, a, function, of, the, dominantly, white, state, run, government, involving, uneven, development, mortgage, and, business, discrimination, and, disinvestment, u, s, ghettos, then, as, suggested, by, race, based, theorists, are, conserved, by, distinctly, racial, reasoning, the, more, dominant, view, on, the, other, hand, is, represented, by, class, based, theorists, such, theories, confirm, class, to, be, more, important, than, race, in, the, structuring, of, u, s, ghettos, although, racial, concentration, is, a, key, signifier, for, ghettos, class, based, theorists, emphasize, the, role, and, impact, of, broader, societal, structures, in, the, creation, of, african, american, or, black, ghettos, dynamics, of, low, wage, service, and, unemployment, triggered, from, deindustrialization, and, the, intergenerational, diffusion, of, status, within, families, and, neighborhoods, for, instance, prove, the, rise, in, socioeconomic, polarization, between, classes, to, be, the, creator, of, american, ghetto, not, racism, furthermore, the, culture, of, poverty, theory, first, developed, by, oscar, lewis, states, that, a, prolonged, history, of, poverty, can, itself, become, a, cultural, obstacle, to, socioeconomic, success, and, in, turn, can, continue, a, pattern, of, socioeconomic, polarization, ghettos, in, short, instill, a, cultural, adaptation, to, social, and, class, based, inequalities, reducing, the, ability, of, future, generations, to, mobilize, or, migrate, an, alternative, theory, put, forward, by, thomas, sowell, in, black, rednecks, and, white, liberals, asserts, that, modern, urban, black, ghetto, culture, is, rooted, in, the, white, cracker, culture, of, the, north, britons, and, scots, irish, who, migrated, from, the, generally, lawless, border, regions, of, britain, to, the, american, south, where, they, formed, a, redneck, culture, common, to, both, black, and, white, people, in, the, antebellum, south, characteristics, of, this, culture, included, lively, music, and, dance, violence, unbridled, emotions, flamboyant, imagery, illegitimacy, religious, oratory, marked, by, strident, rhetoric, and, a, lack, of, emphasis, on, education, and, intellectual, interests, because, redneck, culture, proved, counterproductive, that, culture, long, ago, died, out, among, both, white, and, black, southerners, while, still, surviving, today, in, the, poorest, and, worst, of, the, urban, black, ghettos, which, sowell, described, as, being, characterized, by, brawling, braggadocio, self, indulgence, disregard, of, the, future, and, where, belligerence, is, considered, being, manly, and, crudity, is, considered, cool, while, being, civilized, is, regarded, as, acting, white, sowell, blames, liberal, americans, who, since, the, 1960s, have, embraced, black, ghetto, culture, as, the, only, authentic, black, culture, and, even, glamorize, it, while, they, denounce, any, criticism, of, the, ghetto, lifestyle, or, any, attempt, to, change, it, sowell, asserts, that, white, liberal, americans, have, perpetuated, this, counterproductive, and, self, destructive, lifestyle, among, black, americans, living, in, urban, ghettos, through, the, welfare, state, and, look, the, other, way, policing, and, smiling, at, gangsta, rap, contemporary, african, american, or, black, ghettos, are, characterized, by, an, overrepresentation, of, a, particular, ethnicity, or, race, vulnerability, to, crime, social, problems, governmental, reliance, and, political, disempowerment, sharon, zukin, explains, that, through, these, reasons, society, rationalizes, the, term, bad, neighborhoods, zukin, stresses, that, these, circumstances, are, largely, related, to, racial, concentration, residential, abandonment, and, de, constitution, and, reconstitution, of, communal, institutions, 516, many, scholars, diagnose, this, poorly, facilitated, and, fragmented, view, of, the, united, states, as, the, age, of, extremes, this, term, argues, that, inequalities, of, wealth, and, power, reinforce, spatial, separation, for, example, the, growth, of, gated, communities, can, be, interconnected, with, the, continued, ghettoization, of, the, poor, another, characteristic, to, african, american, or, black, ghettos, and, spatial, separation, is, the, dependence, on, the, state, and, lack, of, communal, autonomy, sharon, zukin, refers, to, brownsville, brooklyn, as, an, example, this, relationship, between, racial, ghettos, and, the, state, is, demonstrated, through, various, push, and, pull, features, implemented, through, government, subsidized, investments, which, certainly, assisted, the, movement, of, white, americans, into, the, suburbs, after, world, war, ii, since, the, 1960s, after, the, de, constitution, of, the, inner, cities, african, american, or, black, ghettos, have, attempted, to, reorganize, or, reconstitute, in, effect, they, are, increasingly, regarded, as, public, and, state, dependent, communities, brownsville, for, instance, initiated, the, constitution, of, community, established, public, housing, anti, poverty, organizations, and, social, service, facilities,
