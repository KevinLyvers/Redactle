in, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, bc, combined, with, written, evidence, it, is, generally, admitted, that, smyrna, and, chios, put, forth, the, strongest, arguments, in, claiming, homer, and, the, main, belief, is, that, he, was, born, in, ionia, a, river, meles, still, bearing, the, same, name, is, located, within, the, city, limits, although, associations, with, the, homeric, river, is, subject, to, controversy, from, the, 7th, century, onwards, smyrna, achieved, the, identity, of, a, city, state, about, a, thousand, people, lived, inside, the, city, walls, with, others, living, in,

small, town, but, an, urban, center, taking, part, in, the, mediterranean, trade, the, city, eventually, became, one, of, the, twelve, ionian, cities, and, was, well, on, its, way, to, becoming, a,

although, recent, analyses, on, the, remains, in, bayrakl, demonstrate, that, the, temple, had, been, in, continuous, use, or, was, very, quickly, repaired, under, the, lydian, rule, soon, afterwards, an, invasion, from, outside, anatolia, by, the, persian, empire, effectively, ended, old, smyrna, s, history, as, an, urban, center, of, note, the, persian, emperor, cyrus, the, great, attacked, the,

smyrna, on, a, small, hill, by, the, sea, was, large, enough, only, for, a, few, thousand, people, therefore, the, slopes, of, mount, pagos, kadifekale, were, chosen, for, the, foundation, of, the,
