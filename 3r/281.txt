project, was, abandoned, under, premier, nikita, khrushchev, in, 2000, the, russian, government, revived, the, idea, adding, a, suggestion, that, a, 40, km, 25, mile, long, bridge, could, be, constructed, between, sakhalin, and, the, japanese, island, of, hokkaid, providing, japan, with, a, direct, connection, to, the, eurasian, railway, network, it, was, claimed, that, construction, work, could, begin, as, early, as, 2001, the, idea, was, received, skeptically, by, the, japanese, government, and, appears, to, have, been, shelved, probably, permanently, after, the, cost, was, estimated, at, as, much, as, 50, billion, in, november, 2008, russian, president, dmitry, medvedev, announced, government, support, for, the, construction, of, the, sakhalin, tunnel, along, with, the, required,

the, oil, and, gas, are, also, bound, for, east, asian, markets, sakhalin, ii, has, come, under, fire, from, environmental, groups, namely, sakhalin, environment, watch, for, dumping, dredging, material, in, aniva, bay, these, groups, were, also, worried, about, the, offshore, pipelines, interfering, with, the, migration, of, whales, off, the, island, the, consortium, has, as, of, january, 2006, rerouted, the, pipeline, to, avoid, the, whale, migration, after, a, doubling, in, the, projected, cost, the, russian, government, threatened, to, halt, the, project, for, environmental, reasons, there, have, been, suggestions, that, the, russian, government, is, using, the, environmental, issues, as, a, pretext, for, obtaining, a, greater, share, of, revenues, from, the, project, and, or, forcing, involvement, by, the, state, controlled, gazprom, the, cost, overruns, at, least, partly, due, to, shell, s, response, to, environmental, concerns, are, reducing, the, share, of, profits, flowing, to, the, russian, treasury, in, 2000, the, oil, and, gas, industry, accounted, for, 57, 5, of, sakhalin, s, industrial, output, by, 2006, it, is, expected, to, account, for, 80, of, the, island, s, industrial, output, sakhalin, s, economy, is, growing, rapidly, thanks, to, its, oil, and, gas, industry, as, of, 18, april, 2007, gazprom, had, taken, a, 50, plus, one, share, interest, in, sakhalin, ii, by, purchasing, 50, of, shell, mitsui, and, mitsubishi, s, shares, in, june, 2021, it, was, announced, that, russia, aims, to, make, sakhalin, island, carbon, neutral, by,
