money, making, proposition, constables, received, half, of, the, fines, from, liquor, cases, meaning, chief, constable, ingram, could, easily, pay, his, 60, per, month, salary, and, the, expense, of, a, town, jail, for, the, town, of, calgary, 1884, turned, out, to, be, a, success, however, two, dark, years, lay, ahead, for, the, fledgling, community, the, turmoil, started, in, late, 1885, when,

herald, and, clerk, of, the, district, court, cayley, published, articles, critical, of, travis, and, his, judgment, in, which, travis, responded, by, calling, cayley, to, court, dismissing, him, from, his, position, as, clerk, ordering, cayley, to, apologize, and, pay, a, 100, fine, cayley, refused, to, pay, the, fine, which, travis, increased, to, 500, and, on, january, 5, the, day, after,

and, the, councillors, guilty, disqualifying, them, from, running, in, the, 1886, election, barring, them, from, municipal, office, for, two, years, and, fining, murdoch, 100, and, the, councillors, 20, this, was, despite, the, fact, murdoch, was, visiting, eastern, canada, while, the, alleged, tampering, was, occurring, travis, disqualification, did, not, dissuade, calgary, voters, and, murdoch, defeated, his, opponent, james, reilly, by, a, significant, margin, in, early, january, to, be, re, elected, as, mayor, travis, accepted, a, petition, from, reilly, to, unseat, murdoch, and, two, of, the, elected, councillors, and, declare, reilly, the, mayor, of, calgary, both, murdoch, and, reilly, claimed, to, be, the, lawful, mayor, of, the, growingly, disorganized, town, of, calgary, both,

1886, destroyed, much, of, the, community, s, downtown, part, of, the, slow, response, to, the, fire, can, be, attributed, to, the, absence, of, functioning, local, government, during, 1886, as, neither, george, murdoch, or, james, reilly, was, capable, of, effectively, governing, the, town, the, newly, ordered, chemical, engine, for, the, recently, organized, calgary, fire, department, calgary, hook, ladder, and, bucket, corps, was, held, in, the, cpr, s, storage, yard, due, to, lack, of, payment, members, of, the, calgary, fire, department, broke, into, the, cpr, storage, yard, on, the, day, of, the, fire, to, retrieve, the, engine, in, total, fourteen, buildings, were, destroyed, with, losses, estimated, at, 103, 200, although, no, one, was, killed, or, injured, the, new, town,

so, davis, s, success, was, a, sign, that, calgary, was, surpassing, edmonton, previously, the, main, centre, on, the, western, prairies, calgary, continued, to, expand, when, real, estate, speculation, took, hold, of, calgary, in, 1889, speculators, began, buying, and, building, west, of, centre, street, and, calgary, quickly, began, to, sprawl, west, to, the, ire, of, property, owners,
