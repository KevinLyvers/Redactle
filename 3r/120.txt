dividing, range, separating, kyrgyzstan, from, kazakhstan, it, is, the, eighth, deepest, lake, in, the, world, the, eleventh, largest, lake, in, the, world, by, volume, though, not, in, surface, area, the, deepest, lake, whose, deepest, point, is, above, sea, level, 939, meters, or, 3, 080, feet, and, the, third, largest, saline, lake, issyk, kul, means, warm, lake, in, the, kyrgyz, language, although, it, is, located, at, a, lofty, elevation, of, 1, 607, metres, 5, 272, ft, and, subject, to, severe, cold, during, winter, it, rarely, freezes, over, due, to, high, salinity, the, lake, is, a, ramsar, site, of, globally, significant, biodiversity, and, forms, part, of, the, issyk, kul, biosphere, reserve, issyk, kul, lake, is, 182, kilometres, 113, mi, long, up, to, 60, kilometres, 37, mi, wide, and, its, area, is, 6, 236, square, kilometres, 2, 408, sq, mi, it, is, the, second, largest, mountain, lake, in, the, world, behind, lake, titicaca, in, south, america, it, is, at, an, altitude, of, 1, 607, metres, 5, 272, ft, and, reaches, 668, metres, 2, 192, ft, in, depth, about, 118, rivers, and, streams, flow, into, the, lake, the, largest, are, the, jyrgalang, and, t, p, it, is, fed, by, springs, including, many, hot, springs, and, snow, melt, the, lake, has, no, current, outlet, but, some, hydrologists, hypothesize, that, the, lake, s, water, filters, deep, underground, into, the, chu, river, the, bottom, of, the, lake, contains, the, mineral, monohydrocalcite, one, of, the, few, known, lacustrine, deposits, the, lake, s, southern, shore, is, dominated, by, the, ruggedly, beautiful, teskey, ala, too, range, of, the, tian, shan, mountains, the, northern, slopes, of, the, range, are, long, and, send, a, considerable, flow, to, issyk, kul, numerous, streams, taking, their, rise, at, the, slopes, flow, together, into, comparatively, large, rivers, they, deeply, dissect, the, range, and, flow, in, wide, valleys, on, exit, from, mountains, the, rivers, form, large, alluvial, cones, in, eastern, part, of, issyk, kul, they, flow, into, jyrgalang, river, the, kungey, alatau, of, the, tian, shan, runs, parallel, to, the, north, shore, the, southern, slopes, of, the, kungey, alatau, are, comparatively, short, therefore, the, rivers, rising, on, them, are, relatively, small, and, do, not, have, a, chance, to, flow, together, to, form, larger, hydrographic, systems, as, a, result, they, separately, empty, either, into, issyk, kul, or, into, t, p, river, flowing, along, the, range, the, lake, water, s, salinity, is, approx, 0, 6, compared, to, 3, 5, salinity, of, typical, seawater, and, although, the, lake, level, is, still, currently, some, 8, metres, 26, ft, higher, than, in, medieval, times, its, level, now, drops, by, approximately, 5,

of, issyk, kul, region, the, lake, contains, highly, endemic, fish, biodiversity, and, some, of, the, species, including, four, endemics, are, seriously, endangered, in, recent, years, yields, of, all, fish, species, have, declined, markedly, due, to, a, combination, of, overfishing, heavy, predation, by, two, of, the, introduced, invasive, species, the, pike, perch, and, the, rainbow, trout, and, the, cessation, of, lake, restocking, with, juvenile, fish, from, hatcheries, at, least, four, commercially, targeted, endemic, fish, species, are, sufficiently, threatened, to, be, included, in,

on, other, species, but, is, limited, in, habitat, for, reproduction, and, in, food, the, lake, supports, large, numbers, of, wintering, waterfowl, as, well, as, waders, and, passerines, on, passage, migration, both, the, western, and, eastern, ends, of, the, lake, have, been, recognised, as, important, bird, areas, ibas, by, birdlife, international, there, is, a, small, lake, below, the, water, level, of, issyk, kul, at, the, south, west, side, of, the, lake, this, lake, is, called, tyz, k, l, salt, lake, in, kyrgyz, due, to, its, very, high, saline, content, and, swimming, in, the, issyk, kul, salt, lake, is, a, very, different, experience, from, less, salty, water, the, lake, receives, its, water, from, small, cold, springs, at, the, beach, which, lead, the, cold, less, heavy, water, to, the, top, of, the, lake, and, often, the, salty, heavy, water, below, is, oddly, more, warm, than, the, water, on, the, surface, during, the, soviet, period, the, soviet, navy, operated, an,

the, 2007, bilateral, agreement, on, friendship, cooperation, mutual, help, and, protection, of, secret, materials, the, russian, military, will, pay, 4, 5, million, annually, to, lease, the, area, india, also, plans, to, invest, in, the, facility, to, test, all, types, of, torpedoes, such, as, heavy, weight, torpedoes, and, those, that, have, thermal, navigation, system, another, advantage, that, works, for, the, testing, center, is, that, the, torpedoes, fired, can, also, be, recovered, allowing, scientists, to, make, physical, verification, of, a, torpedo, structure, for, further, study, india, is, also, planning, to, use, the, torpedo, test, facility, to, test, the, autonomous, underwater, vehicle, being, developed, by, nstl, for, this, india, has, proposed, to, engage, local, companies, with, know, how, in, torpedo, technology, to, further, co, develop, the, facility, towns, and, some, villages, around, the, lake, listed, clockwise, from, the, lake, s, western, tip
