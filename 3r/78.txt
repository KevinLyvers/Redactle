baffin, bay, inuktitut, saknirutiak, imanga, greenlandic, avannaata, imaa, french, baie, de, baffin, danish, baffinbugten, located, between, baffin, island, and, the, west, coast, of, greenland, is, defined, by, the, international, hydrographic, organization, as, a, marginal, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, art, 23, it, is, sometimes, considered, a, sea, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, it, is, connected, to, the, atlantic, via, davis, strait, and, the, labrador, sea, the, narrower, nares, strait, connects, baffin, bay, with, the, arctic, ocean, the, bay, is, not, navigable, most, of, the, year, because, of, the, ice, cover, and, high, density, of, floating, ice, and, icebergs, in, the, open, areas, however, a, polynya, of, about, 80, 000, km, 2, 31, 000, sq, mi, known, as, the, north, water, opens, in, summer, on, the, north, near, smith, sound, most, of, the, aquatic, life, of, the, bay, is, concentrated, near, that, region, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, baffin, bay, as, follows, on, the, north, a, line, from, cape, sheridan, grant, land, 82, 35, n, 60, 45, w, 82, 583, n, 60, 750, w, 82, 583, 60, 750, to, cape, bryant, greenland, on, the, east, the, west, coast, of, greenland, on, the, south, the, parallel, of, 70, north, between, greenland, and, baffin, land, on, the, west, the, eastern, limits, of, the, north, west, passages, the, area, of, the, bay, has, been, inhabited, since, c, 500, bc, around, ad, 1200, the, initial, dorset, settlers, were, replaced, by, the, thule, the, later, inuit, peoples, recent, excavations, also, suggest, that, the, norse, colonization, of, the, americas, reached, the, shores, of, baffin, bay, sometime, between, the, 10th, and, 15th, centuries, the, english, explorer, john, davis, was, the, first, recorded, european, to, enter, the, bay, arriving, in, 1585, in, 1612, a, group, of, english, merchants, formed, the, company, of, merchants, of, london, discoverers, of, the, north, west, passage, their, governor, thomas, smythe, organized, five, expeditions, to, explore, the, northern, coasts, of, canada, in, search, of, a, maritime, passage, to, the, far, east, henry, hudson, and, thomas, button, explored, hudson, bay, william, gibbons, labrador, and, robert, bylot, hudson, strait, and, the, area, which, became, known, as, baffin, s, bay, after, his, pilot, william, baffin, aboard, discovery, baffin, charted, the, area, and, named, lancaster, smith, and, jones, sounds, after, members, of, his, company, by, the, completion, of, his, 1616, voyage, baffin, held, out, no, hope, of, an, ice, free, passage, and, the, area, remained, unexplored, for, another, two, centuries, over, time, his, account, came, to, be, doubted, until, it, was, confirmed, by, john, ross, s, 1818, voyage, more, advanced, scientific, studies, followed, in, 1928, in, the, 1930s, and, after, world, war, ii, by, danish, american, and, canadian, expeditions, currently, there, are, a, few, inuit, settlements, on, the, canadian, coast, of, the, bay, including, arctic, bay, population, 690, pond, inlet, 1, 315, and, clyde, river, 820, those, settlements, are, accessed, and, supplied, by, air, and, annual, sealifts, in, 1975, a, town, was, built, at, nanisivik, to, support, lead, and, zinc, production, at, the, nanisivik, mine, the, first, canadian, mine, in, the, arctic, the, mine, was, closed, in, 2002, due, to, declining, resources, and, metal, prices, whereas, the, town, still, has, a, functional, seaport, and, an, airport, as, of, the, 2006, census, it, has, an, official, population, of, zero, baffin, bay, was, the, epicenter, of, a, 7, 3, magnitude, earthquake, in, 1933, this, is, the, largest, known, earthquake, north, of, the, arctic, circle, it, caused, no, damage, because, of, its, offshore, location, and, the, small, number, of, the, nearby, onshore, communities, the, northwestern, part, of, the, bay, remains, one, of, the, most, seismically, active, regions, in, eastern, canada, five, earthquakes, of, magnitude, 6, have, occurred, here, since, 1933, the, latest, strong, earthquake, occurred, on, 15, april, 2010, and, had, the, magnitude, of, 5, 1, baffin, bay, is, an, arm, of, the, atlantic, ocean, bounded, by, the, baffin, island, in, the, west, greenland, in, the, east, and, ellesmere, island, in, the, north, it, connects, to, the, atlantic, through, the, davis, strait, and, to, the, arctic, through, several, narrow, channels, of, nares, strait, it, is, a, northwestern, extension, of, the, north, atlantic, and, labrador, sea, it, can, also, be, viewed, as, a, long, strait, separating, baffin, island, and, greenland, the, bay, is, less, than, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, deep, near, the, coast, where, the, sea, bottom, is, covered, with, gravel, crushed, stone, and, sand, in, the, centre, there, is, a, deep, pit, called, the, baffin, basin, reaching, 2, 136, m, 7, 008, ft, see, depth, map, which, is, mostly, covered, in, silt, currents, form, a, cyclonic, circulation, on, the, eastern, periphery, in, summer, the, west, greenland, current, transports, water, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, north, in, its, western, part, the, baffin, island, current, brings, the, arctic, waters, to, the, south, the, climate, is, arctic, with, frequent, storms, especially, in, winter, average, january, temperatures, are, 20, c, 4, f, in, the, south, and, 28, c, 18, f, in, the, north, in, july, the, average, temperature, is, 7, c, 45, f, the, annual, precipitation, is, 100, 250, mm, 3, 9, 9, 8, in, on, the, greenland, side, and, about, twice, as, much, near, baffin, island, the, water, temperature, at, the, surface, is, below, 1, c, 30, f, in, winter, in, summer, it, varies, from, 4, 5, c, 39, 41, f, in, the, south, east, to, 0, c, 32, f, and, below, at, north, west, the, salinity, exceeds, 34, parts, per, thousand, in, winter, in, summer, it, is, 32, on, the, east, and, 30, 31, on, the, west, deep, waters, are, formed, as, a, result, of, mixing, of, arctic, and, atlantic, waters, their, temperature, is, about, 0, 5, c, 31, 1, f, and, salinity, is, 34, 5, in, winter, 80, of, the, bay, is, covered, with, continuous, ice, floating, ice, and, fast, ice, in, some, winters, the, continuous, ice, stretches, from, shore, to, shore, the, ice, is, most, abundant, in, march, and, least, in, august, september, in, summer, drifting, ice, remains, in, the, central, and, western, parts, of, the, bay, numerous, icebergs, are, formed, in, this, period, and, are, brought, together, with, ice, to, the, atlantic, ocean, near, newfoundland, the, tides, are, semidiurnal, with, an, average, height, of, 4, m, 13, ft, and, the, maximum, of, 9, m, 30, ft, their, speed, varies, between, 1, and, 3, 7, km, h, 0, 62, and, 2, 30, mph, hour, and, the, direction, by, as, much, as, 180, this, variability, results, in, the, collision, and, crushing, of, fresh, old, and, pack, ice, winds, are, predominantly, north, western, through, the, whole, year, south, eastern, and, eastern, winds, are, common, in, july, and, august, between, may, and, july, sometimes, april, a, significant, portion, of, navigable, open, water, polynya, forms, at, the, extreme, north, of, the, bay, presumably, due, to, the, relatively, warm, greenland, current, with, an, area, of, about, 80, 000, km, 2, 31, 000, sq, mi, in, summer, it, is, the, largest, polynya, of, the, canadian, arctic, and, covers, the, smith, sound, between, the, ellesmere, island, and, greenland, this, polynya, has, a, stable, position, and, existed, for, at, least, 9, 000, years, it, was, first, described, in, 1616, by, william, baffin, and, was, named, north, water, by, whalers, of, the, 18, 19th, centuries, the, north, water, provides, air, to, ice, algae, and, zooplankton, and, is, characterized, by, abundant, fauna, of, about, 20, 000, beluga, whales, living, in, the, baffin, bay, some, 15, 000, are, concentrated, at, the, north, water, other, abundant, animals, of, the, region, include, walrus, narwhal, harp, seal, bearded, seal, ringed, seal, bowhead, whale, rorquals, and, polar, bear, all, aquatic, mammals, crucially, depend, on, the, availability, of, open, water, they, have, very, limited, ability, to, maintain, breathing, holes, in, ice, and, are, all, vulnerable, to, attacks, by, the, polar, bear, when, breathing, at, the, holes, the, seals, and, walrus, occupy, areas, of, fast, ice, which, is, essential, for, giving, birth, and, raising, the, pups, bearded, seals, feed, near, the, bottom, of, the, bay, and, therefore, are, restricted, to, the, shallow, waters, ringed, seal, is, the, most, common, meal, of, the, polar, bear, it, is, also, an, occasional, prey, of, the, walrus, and, arctic, fox, most, large, animals, of, the, bay, are, being, traditionally, hunted, but, the, hunting, has, been, restricted, in, the, 20th, century, in, order, to, preserve, the, wildlife, population, for, example, the, quota, for, polar, bears, in, the, bay, area, is, 105, per, year, there, are, about, 400, plant, and, tree, species, on, the, bay, shores, including, birch, willow, alder, and, plants, adapted, to, salty, soils, as, well, as, lyme, grass, mosses, and, lichens, these, serve, as, food, for, caribou, and, rodents, such, as, lemming, resident, fish, species, include, polar, cod, arctic, flounder, pleuronectidae, liopsetta, four, horned, sculpin, and, capelin, whereas, cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and, rattail, migrate, from, the, atlantic, the, birds, are, represented, by, the, little, auk, snowy, owl, willow, ptarmigan, rock, ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, arctic, redpoll, and, guillemots, most, of, them, migrate, to, the, south, during, the, winter, the, us, geological, survey, has, estimated, that, at, least, 13, of, the, world, s, undiscovered, oil, deposits, and, 30, of, the, world, s, undiscovered, gas, pockets, are, located, in, the, arctic, with, the, seas, around, greenland, potentially, holding, large, amounts, of, natural, gas, and, lesser, amounts, of, crude, oil, and, natural, gas, liquids, accordingly, the, greenland, authorities, have, offered, a, large, number, of, off, shore, concessions, for, potential, hydrocarbon, oil, and, gas, extraction, the, largest, concession, areas, are, located, in, seas, west, of, greenland, primarily, in, baffin, bay, and, the, davis, strait, but, with, several, smaller, concessions, in, the, greenland, sea, in, the, east, also
