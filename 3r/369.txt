the, a, r, mountains, or, a, r, massif, tamaj, q, ay, r, hausa, eastern, azbin, western, abzin, is, a, triangular, massif, located, in, northern, niger, within, the, sahara, part, of, the, west, saharan, montane, xeric, woodlands, ecoregion, they, rise, to, more, than, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, and, extend, over, 84, 000, km, 2, 32, 000, sq, mi, lying, in, the, midst, of, desert, north, of, the, 17th, parallel, the, a, r, plateau, with, an, average, altitude, between, 500, and, 900, m, 1, 600, and, 3, 000, ft, forms, an, island, of, sahel, climate, which, supports, a, wide, variety, of, life, many, pastoral, and, farming, communities, and, dramatic, geological, and, archaeological, sites, there, are, notable, archaeological, excavations, in, the, region, that, illustrate, the, prehistoric, past, of, this, region, the, endangered, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, once, existed, in, this, region, but, may, now, be, extirpated, due, to, human, population, pressures, in, this, region, the, precambrian, to, cenozoic, a, r, mountains, consist, of, peralkaline, granite, intrusions, which, appear, dark, in, colour, unusual, since, most, granitic, masses, are, light, toned, in, the, field, in, the, sahara, desert, such, mountains, often, stand, out, in, stark, relief, as, topographic, heights, amidst, lowlands, covered, by, sand, the, terrain, consists, of, high, plateau, mountain, ranges, and, broad, sandy, valleys, and, seasonal, wadis, which, once, contained, rivers, areas, of, these, deep, often, intersecting, valleys, also, contain, waterborne, clay, and, silt, deposits, underground, watercourses, in, some, of, these, valleys, continue, to, provide, year, round, oasis, and, seasonal, vegetation, the, a, r, mountains, themselves, consist, of, nine, almost, circular, massifs, rising, from, a, rocky, plateau, bordered, by, the, sand, dunes, and, plain, of, the, t, n, r, desert, to, the, east, the, massif, is, a, plateau, consisting, of, a, sub, cambrian, age, erosion, surface, on, precambrian, metamorphic, rocks, punctuated, by, a, series, of, flat, topped, granite, intrusion, peaks, which, include, mont, idoukal, n, tagh, s, niger, s, highest, point,

extinct, caldera, of, arakao, cenozoic, lava, flows, of, hawaiite, to, trachyte, composition, volcanic, cones, tuff, rings, and, one, of, the, largest, ring, dike, systems, in, the, world, at, izouzaoenehe, lie, the, marble, blue, mountains, and, the, lower, zagado, valley, is, surrounded, by, white, marble, hills, carboniferous, sandstone, and, coal, units, in, the, iullemmeden, basin, just, to, the, west, of, the, massif, contain, uranium, mineralisation, sourced, from, the, granites, of, the, massif, because, of, its, altitude, on, average, between, 500, and, 900, m, and, despite, its, low, rainfall, 50, to, 160, mm, year, on, the, lower, plateau, the, a, r, forms, a, green, region, in, comparison, with, the, surrounding, deserts, especially, after, the, august, september, seasonal, rains, the, climate, is, classified, as, sahel, like, that, of, the, regions, well, to, its, south, while, the, mountains, are, largely, bare, of, vegetation, the, dry, wadi, river, valleys, known, by, the, hausa, term, kori, channel, and, hold, rainwater, in, gueltas, stone, pools, such, as, that, near, the, town, of, timia, creating, oases, which, provide, forage, for, animals, and, in, some, areas, farming, the, high, bagzane, plateau, of, the, central, a, r, in, particular, provides, adequate, rainfall, for, intensive, agriculture, other, vast, areas, of, the, region, are, entirely, devoid, of, plant, life, and, with, their, volcanic, protrusions, and, rock, fields, present, an, otherworldly, appearance, more, than, 430, vascular, species, have, been, recorded, so, far, in, the, a, r, mountains, the, location, of, the, a, r, as, a, southern, extension, of, the, hoggar, mountain, range, makes, it, a, connection, between, the, saharan, flora, and, the, sahelian, flora, however, the, presence, of, mountains, up, to, 2000, m, a, s, l, generates, locally, favourable, conditions, for, several, species, of, the, sudanian, zone, and, the, mediterranean, zone, during, the, 20th, century, a, series, of, scientific, missions, in, the, a, r, has, permitted, to, identify, the, majority, of, plant, species, developing, in, the, a, r, vachellia, tortilis, subsp, raddiana, afagag, and, balanites, aegyptiaca, aborak, are, among, the, most, frequent, tree, species, in, the, intermountain, zone, in, the, vicinity, of, temporary, rivers, named, koris, species, like, vachellia, nilotica, faidherbia, albida, and, the, palm, hyphaene, thebaica, coexist, with, date, palm, cultivars, phoenix, dactylifera, severe, droughts, and, high, aridity, have, made, the, intermountain, zone, of, the, a, r, a, particularly, harsh, place, for, plants, to, develop, the, additional, presence, of, domestic, herbivores, has, led, to, a, severe, deficit, in, tree, regeneration, which, has, been, cited, as, a, major, ecological, concern, tree, regeneration, has, been, observed, enhanced, as, soon, as, tree, seedlings, are, protected, by, large, tussocks, of, the, frequent, grass, panicum, turgidum, this, positive, interaction, between, plants, represents, a, promising, restoration, tool, to, be, used, by, local, inhabitants, in, comparison, mountainous, areas, are, even, less, documented, tropical, tree, species, less, resistant, to, drought, have, been, described, in, the, highlands, among, which, the, fabaceae, senegalia, laeta, and, vachellia, seyal, quezel, has, observed, the, remnant, presence, of, a, rare, endemic, taxon, related, to, the, olive, in, the, northern, sector, of, the, a, r, range, recently, this, taxon, olea, europaea, subsp, laperrinei, has, been, found, in, other, mountains, of, the, a, r, these, very, isolated, small, populations, represent, the, southern, limit, of, the, species, distribution, a, study, led, on,

pachycymbium, decaisneanum, cleome, aculeata, echinops, mildbraedii, and, indigofera, nummularia, are, tropical, species, with, relatively, low, resistance, to, water, stress, whereas, silene,

evidence, a, marked, mountain, climatic, specificity, in, the, a, r, with, a, positive, impact, on, species, richness, and, species, diversity, because, of, their, strong, geographic, isolation,
