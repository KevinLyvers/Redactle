hokkaido, japanese, hepburn, hokkaid, pronounced, lit, northern, sea, circuit, is, the, second, largest, island, of, japan, and, comprises, the, largest, and, northernmost, prefecture, making, up, its, own, region, the, tsugaru, strait, separates, hokkaid, from, honshu, the, two, islands, are, connected, by, the, undersea, railway, seikan, tunnel, the, largest, city, on, hokkaido, is, its, capital, sapporo, which, is, also, its, only, ordinance, designated, city, sakhalin, lies, about, 43, kilometres, 27, mi, to, the, north, of, hokkaid, and, to, the, east, and, northeast, are, the, kuril, islands, which, are, administered, by, russia, though, the, four, most, southerly, are, claimed, by, japan, the, position, of, the, island, on, the, northern, end, of, the, archipelago, results, in, colder, climate, with, the, island, seeing, significant, snowfall, each, winter, despite, the, harsher, climate, it, serves, as, an, agricultural, breadbasket, for, many, crops, hokkaido, was, formerly, known, as, ezo, yezo, yeso, or, yesso, although, japanese, settlers, ruled, the, southern, tip, of, the, island, since, the, 16th, century, hokkaido, was, primarily, inhabited, by, the, ainu, people, in, 1869, following, the, meiji, restoration, the, entire, island, was, annexed, colonized, and, renamed, hokkaido, by, japan, japanese, settlers, dispossessed, the, ainu, of, their, land, and, forced, them, to, assimilate, in, the, 21st, century, the, ainu, are, almost, totally, assimilated, into, japanese, society, as, a, result, the, majority, of, japanese, of, ainu, descent, have, no, knowledge, of, their, heritage, and, culture, when, establishing, the, development, commission, the, meiji, government, decided, to, change, the, name, of, ezochi, matsuura, takeshir, submitted, six, proposals, including, names, such, as, kaihokud, and, hokkaid, to, the, government, the, government, eventually, decided, to, use, the, name, hokkaid, but, decided, to, write, it, as, as, a, compromise, between, and, because, of, the, similarity, with, names, such, as, t, kaid, according, to, matsuura, the, name, was, thought, up, because, the, ainu, called, the, region, kai, the, kai, element, also, strongly, resembles, the, on, yomi, or, sino, japanese, reading, of, the, characters, on, yomi, as, kun, yomi, as, which, have, been, used, for, over, a, thousand, years, in, china, and, japan, as, the, standard, orthographic, form, to, be, used, when, referring, to, ainu, and, related, peoples, it, is, possible, that, matsuura, s, kai, was, actually, an, alteration, influenced, by, the, sino, japanese, reading, of, ka, i, of, the, nivkh, exonym, for, the, ainu, namely, qoy, or, ipa, in, 1947, hokkaid, became, a, full, fledged, prefecture, the, historical, suffix, d, translates, to, prefecture, in, english, ambiguously, the, same, as, fu, for, osaka, and, kyoto, and, ken, for, the, rest, of, the, prefectures, d, as, shorthand, can, be, used, to, uniquely, identify, hokkaido, for, example, as, in, d, d, hokkaido, road, or, d, gikai, hokkaido, assembly, the, same, way, to, is, used, for, tokyo, the, prefecture, s, government, calls, itself, the, hokkaid, government, rather, than, the, hokkaid, prefectural, government, with, the, rise, of, indigenous, rights, movements, there, emerged, a, notion, that, hokkaido, should, have, an, ainu, language, name, if, a, decision, to, change, the, name, is, made, however, whichever, ainu, phrase, is, chosen, its, original, referent, is, critically, different, from, the, large, geographical, entity, the, phrase, aynumosir, has, been, a, preferred, choice, among, japanese, activists, its, primary, meaning, is, the, land, of, humans, as, opposed, to, the, land, of, gods, kamuymosir, when, contrasted, with, sisammosir, the, land, of, the, neighbors, often, pointing, to, honshu, or, japanese, settlements, on, the, southern, tip, of, hokkaido, it, means, the, land, of, the, ainu, people, which, depending, on, context, can, refer, to, hokkaido, although, from, a, modern, ethnolinguistic, point, of, view, the, ainu, people, have, extended, their, domain, to, a, large, part, of, sakhalin, and, the, entire, kuril, islands, another, phrase, yaunmosir, has, gained, prominence, it, literally, means, the, onshore, land, as, opposed, to, the, offshore, land, repunmosir, which, depending, on, context, can, refer, to, the, kuril, islands, honshu, or, any, foreign, country, if, the, speaker, is, a, resident, of, hokkaido, yaunmosir, can, refer, to, hokkaido, yet, another, phrase, akor, mosir, means, our, inclusive, land, if, uttered, among, hokkaido, ainus, it, can, refer, to, hokkaido, or, japan, as, a, whole, during, the, jomon, period, the, local, culture, and, the, associated, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, flourished, in, hokkaid, beginning, over, 15, 000, years, ago, in, contrast, to, the, island, of, honshu, hokkaid, saw, an, absence, of, conflict, during, this, time, period, jomon, beliefs, in, natural, spirits, are, theorized, to, be, the, origins, of, ainu, spirituality, about, 2, 000, years, ago, the, island, was, colonized, by, yayoi, people, and, much, of, the, island, s, population, shifted, away, from, hunting, and, gathering, towards, agriculture, the, nihon, shoki, finished, in, 720, ad, is, often, said, to, be, the, first, mention, of, hokkaid, in, recorded, history, according, to, the, text, abe, no, hirafu, led, a, large, navy, and, army, to, northern, areas, from, 658, to, 660, and, came, into, contact, with, the, mishihase, and, emishi, one, of, the, places, hirafu, went, to, was, called, watarishima, which, is, often, believed, to, be, present, day, hokkaid, however, many, theories, exist, concerning, the, details, of, this, event, including, the, location, of, watarishima, and, the, common, belief, that, the, emishi, in, watarishima, were, the, ancestors, of, the, present, day, ainu, people, during, the, nara, and, heian, periods, 710, 1185, people, in, hokkaid, conducted, trade, with, dewa, province, an, outpost, of, the, japanese, central, government, from, the, feudal, period, the, people, in, hokkaid, began, to, be, called, ezo, hokkaid, subsequently, became, known, as, ezochi, lit, ezo, land, or, ezogashima, lit, island, of, the, ezo, the, ezo, mainly, relied, upon, hunting, and, fishing, and, obtained, rice, and, iron, through, trade, with, the, japanese, during, the, muromachi, period, 1336, 1573, the, japanese, established, a, settlement, at, the, south, of, the, oshima, peninsula, with, a, series, of, fortified, residences, such, as, that, of, shinoridate, as, more, people, moved, to, the, settlement, to, avoid, battles, disputes, arose, between, the, japanese, and, the, ainu, the, disputes, eventually, developed, into, war, takeda, nobuhiro, 1431, 1494, killed, the, ainu, leader, koshamain, and, defeated, the, opposition, in, 1457, nobuhiro, s, descendants, became, the, rulers, of, the, matsumae, han, which, was, granted, exclusive, trading, rights, with, the, ainu, in, the, azuchi, momoyama, and, edo, periods, 1568, 1868, the, matsumae, family, s, economy, relied, upon, trade, with, the, ainu, who, had, extensive, trading, networks, the, matsumae, held, authority, over, the, south, of, ezochi, until, the, end, of, the, edo, period, the, matsumae, clan, rule, over, the, ainu, must, be, understood, in, the, context, of, the, expansion, of, the, japanese, feudal, state, medieval, military, leaders, in, northern, honshu, ex, northern, fujiwara, akita, clan, maintained, only, tenuous, political, and, cultural, ties, to, the, imperial, court, and, its, proxies, the, kamakura, shogunate, and, ashikaga, shogunate, feudal, strongmen, sometimes, defined, their, own, roles, within, the, medieval, institutional, order, taking, shogunate, titles, while, in, other, times, they, assumed, titles, that, seemed, to, give, them, a, non, japanese, identity, in, fact, many, of, the, feudal, strongmen, were, descended, from, emishi, military, leaders, who, had, been, assimilated, into, japanese, society, the, matsumae, clan, were, of, yamato, descent, like, other, ethnic, japanese, people, whereas, the, emishi, of, northern, honshu, were, a, distinctive, group, related, to, the, ainu, the, emishi, were, conquered, and, integrated, into, the, japanese, state, dating, back, as, far, as, the, 8th, century, and, as, result, began, to, lose, their, distinctive, culture, and, ethnicity, as, they, became, minorities, by, the, time, the, matsumae, clan, ruled, over, the, ainu, most, of, the, emishi, were, ethnically, mixed, and, physically, closer, to, japanese, than, they, were, to, ainu, from, this, the, transformation, theory, postulates, that, native, j, mon, peoples, changed, gradually, with, the, infusion, of, yayoi, immigrants, into, the, t, hoku, region, of, northern, honshu, in, contrast, to, the, replacement, theory, that, posits, the, j, mon, was, replaced, by, the, yayoi, there, were, numerous, revolts, by, the, ainu, against, feudal, rule, the, last, large, scale, resistance, was, shakushain, s, revolt, in, 1669, 1672, in, 1789, a, smaller, movement, known, as, the, menashi, kunashir, rebellion, was, crushed, after, that, rebellion, the, terms, japanese, and, ainu, referred, to, clearly, distinguished, groups, and, the, matsumae, were, unequivocally, japanese, according, to, john, a, harrison, of, the, university, of, florida, prior, to, 1868, japan, used, proximity, as, its, claim, to, hokkaido, saghalien, and, the, kuril, islands, however, japan, had, never, thoroughly, explored, governed, or, exploited, the, areas, and, this, claim, was, invalidated, by, the, movement, of, russia, into, the, northeast, pacific, area, and, by, russian, settlements, on, kamchatka, from, 1699, sakhalin, 1850s, and, the, sea, of, okhotsk, coast, 1640s, onwards, prior, to, the, meiji, restoration, of, 1868, the, tokugawa, shogunate, realized, the, need, to, prepare, northern, defenses, against, a, possible, russian, invasion, and, took, over, control, of, most, of, ezochi, in, 1855, 1858, many, japanese, settlers, regarded, the, ainu, as, inhuman, and, the, inferior, descendants, of, dogs, the, tokugawa, irregularly, imposed, various, assimilation, programs, on, the, ainu, due, to, the, tokugawa, s, perception, of, a, threat, from, russia, for, example, assimilation, programs, were, implemented, in, response, to, perceived, threats, from, russia, which, included, the, laxman, expedition, of, 1793, and, the, golovnin, incident, of, 1804, once, the, respective, russian, threats, appeared, to, subside, the, assimilation, programs, were, halted, until, 1855, however, in, 1855, once, the, treaty, of, shimoda, was, signed, which, defined, the, borders, between, russian, empire, and, tokugawa, japan, the, tokugawa, again, viewed, russia, as, a, threat, to, japanese, sovereignty, over, hokkaido, and, reinstated, assimilation, programs, on, the, ainu, prior, to, the, meiji, era, the, island, was, called, ezochi, which, can, be, translated, as, land, of, the, barbarians, or, the, land, for, people, who, did, not, obey, the, government, shortly, after, the, boshin, war, in, 1868, a, group, of, tokugawa, loyalists, led, by, enomoto, takeaki, temporarily, occupied, the, island, the, polity, is, commonly, but, mistakenly, known, as, the, republic, of, ezo, but, the, rebellion, was, defeated, in, may, 1869, through, colonial, practices, ezochi, was, annexed, into, japanese, territory, ezochi, was, subsequently, put, under, control, of, hakodate, prefectural, government, when, establishing, the, development, commission, kaitakushi, the, meiji, government, introduced, a, new, name, after, 1869, the, northern, japanese, island, was, known, as, hokkaid, which, can, be, translated, to, northern, sea, route, and, regional, subdivisions, were, established, including, the, provinces, of, oshima, shiribeshi, iburi, ishikari, teshio, kitami, hidaka, tokachi, kushiro, nemuro, and, chishima, the, initiative, to, colonize, ezo, which, later, became, hokkaido, traces, back, to, 1869, where, japanese, proponents, argued, that, the, colonization, of, ezo, would, serve, as, a, strategic, move, to, enhance, japan, s, standing, and, influence, on, the, global, stage, particularly, in, negotiations, with, western, powers, specifically, russia, the, meiji, government, invested, heavily, in, colonizing, hokkaido, for, several, reasons, firstly, they, aimed, to, assert, their, control, over, the, region, as, a, buffer, against, potential, russian, advances, secondly, they, were, attracted, to, hokkaido, s, rich, natural, resources, including, coal, timber, fish, and, fertile, land, lastly, since, western, powers, viewed, colonial, expansion, as, a, symbol, of, prestige, japan, viewed, the, colonization, of, hokkaido, as, an, opportunity, to, present, itself, as, a, modern, and, respected, nation, to, western, powers, the, primary, purpose, of, the, development, commission, was, to, secure, hokkaid, before, the, russians, extended, their, control, of, the, far, east, beyond, vladivostok, the, japanese, failed, to, settle, in, the, interior, lowlands, of, the, island, because, of, aboriginal, resistance, the, resistance, was, eventually, destroyed, and, the, lowlands, were, under, the, control, of, the, commission, the, most, important, goal, of, the, japanese, was, to, increase, the, farm, population, and, to, create, a, conducive, environment, for, emigration, and, settlement, however, the, japanese, did, not, have, expertise, in, modern, agricultural, techniques, and, only, possessed, primitive, mining, and, lumbering, methods, kuroda, kiyotaka, was, put, in, charge, of, the, project, and, turned, to, the, united, states, for, help, his, first, step, was, to, journey, to, the, united, states, and, recruit, horace, capron, president, ulysses, s, grant, s, commissioner, of, agriculture, from, 1871, to, 1873, capron, bent, his, efforts, to, expounding, western, agriculture, and, mining, with, mixed, results, frustrated, with, obstacles, to, his, efforts, capron, returned, home, in, 1875, in, 1876, william, s, clark, arrived, to, found, an, agricultural, college, in, sapporo, although, he, only, remained, a, year, clark, left, a, lasting, impression, on, hokkaid, inspiring, the, japanese, with, his, teachings, on, agriculture, as, well, as, christianity, his, parting, words, boys, be, ambitious, can, be, found, on, public, buildings, in, hokkaid, to, this, day, the, population, of, hokkaid, increased, from, 58, 000, to, 240, 000, during, that, decade, kuroda, hired, capron, for, 10, 000, per, year, and, paid, for, all, expenses, related, to, the, mission, kuroda, and, his, government, were, likely, intrigued, by, capron, s, previous, colonial, experience, particularly, his, involvement, in, the, forced, removal, of, native, americans, from, texas, to, new, territories, after, the, mexican, american, war, capron, introduced, capital, intensive, farming, techniques, by, adopting, american, methods, and, tools, importing, seeds, for, western, crops, and, bringing, in, european, livestock, breeds, which, included, his, favorite, north, devon, cattle, he, founded, experimental, farms, in, hokkaido, conducted, surveys, to, assess, mineral, deposits, and, agricultural, potential, and, advocated, for, improvements, in, water, access, mills, and, roads, the, settler, colonization, of, hokkaido, by, the, japanese, was, organized, and, supported, through, collaboration, between, the, japanese, state, and, american, experts, and, technology, from, the, 1870s, to, the, 1880s, japanese, leaders, placed, their, efforts, on, settling, hokkaido, by, systematically, migrating, former, samurai, lords, samurai, retainers, and, common, citizens, which, included, farmers, and, peasants, providing, them, with, free, land, and, financial, assistance, this, transformation, was, facilitated, with, the, expertise, of, american, advisors, who, introduced, various, colonization, technologies, transforming, hokkaido, into, land, suitable, for, japan, s, capitalist, aspirations, japanese, leaders, drew, inspiration, from, american, settler, colonialism, during, their, diplomatic, visits, to, the, united, states, japanese, colonial, officials, learned, settler, colonial, techniques, from, western, imperial, powers, particularly, the, united, states, this, included, declaring, large, portions, of, hokkaido, as, ownerless, land, providing, a, pretext, for, the, dispossession, of, the, ainu, people, japan, established, the, hokkaido, colonization, board, in, 1869, a, year, after, the, start, of, the, meiji, era, with, the, goal, of, encouraging, japanese, settlers, to, hokkaido, mainland, japanese, settlers, began, migrating, to, hokkaido, leading, to, japan, s, colonization, of, the, island, motivated, by, capitalist, and, industrial, goals, the, meiji, government, forcefully, appropriated, fertile, land, and, mineral, rich, regions, throughout, hokkaido, without, consideration, for, their, historical, ainu, inhabitancy, the, meiji, government, implemented, land, seizures, and, enacted, land, ownership, laws, that, favored, japanese, settlers, effectively, stripping, ainu, people, of, their, customary, land, rights, and, traditional, means, of, subsistence, the, 1899, hokkaido, former, aborigines, protection, act, further, marginalized, and, impoverished, the, ainu, people, by, forcing, them, to, leave, their, traditional, lands, and, relocating, them, to, the, rugged, mountainous, regions, in, the, center, of, the, island, the, act, prohibited, the, ainu, from, fishing, and, hunting, which, were, their, main, source, of, subsistence, the, ainu, were, valued, primarily, as, a, source, of, inexpensive, manual, labor, and, discriminatory, assimilation, policies, further, entrenched, their, sense, of, inferiority, as, well, as, worsened, poverty, and, disease, within, ainu, communities, these, policies, exacerbated, diasporic, trends, among, the, ainu, population, as, many, sought, employment, with, the, government, or, private, enterprises, often, earning, meager, wages, that, barely, sustained, their, families, the, meiji, government, embarked, on, assimilation, campaigns, aimed, not, only, at, assimilating, the, ainu, but, also, eradicating, their, language, and, culture, entirely, they, were, forced, to, take, on, japanese, names, and, language, and, gradually, saw, their, culture, and, traditions, eroded, the, ainu, were, forbidden, to, speak, their, own, language, and, taught, only, japanese, at, school, facing, pervasive, stigma, many, ainu, concealed, their, heritage, given, the, meiji, state, s, full, political, control, over, the, island, the, subsequent, subjugation, of, its, indigenous, inhabitants, aggressive, economic, exploitation, and, ambitious, permanent, settlement, endeavors, hokkaido, emerged, as, the, sole, successful, settler, colony, of, japan, after, the, meiji, colonization, of, hokkaido, meiji, japan, depended, on, prison, labour, to, accelerate, the, colonization, process, the, japanese, built, three, prisons, and, rendered, hokkaido, a, prison, island, where, political, prisoners, were, incarcerated, and, used, as, prison, labour, during, the, opening, ceremony, of, the, first, prison, the, ainu, name, shibetsuputo, was, replaced, with, the, japanese, name, tsukigata, as, an, attempt, to, japanize, hokkaido, s, geography, the, second, prison, opened, near, the, hokutan, horonai, coal, mine, where, ainu, people, were, forced, to, work, cheap, prison, labour, played, an, important, role, in, coal, and, sulphur, mining, as, well, as, road, construction, in, hokkaido, eventually, several, types, of, indentured, labour, korean, labour, child, labour, and, women, labour, replaced, convict, labour, in, hokkaido, working, conditions, were, difficult, and, dangerous, japan, s, transition, to, capitalism, depended, heavily, on, the, growth, of, the, coal, mining, sector, in, hokkaid, the, importance, of, coal, from, hokkaid, increased, throughout, the, first, world, war, and, the, mines, required, a, large, amount, of, labourers, in, mid, july, 1945, various,
