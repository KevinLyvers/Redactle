the, panama, canal, spanish, canal, de, panam, is, an, artificial, 82, kilometer, 51, mile, waterway, in, panama, that, connects, the, atlantic, ocean, with, the, pacific, ocean, cutting, across, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, is, a, conduit, for, maritime, trade, locks, at, each, end, lift, ships, up, to, gatun, lake, an, artificial, fresh, water, lake, 26, meters, 85, ft, above, sea, level, created, by, damming, up, the, chagres, river, and, lake, alajuela, to, reduce, the, amount, of, excavation, work, required, for, the, canal, locks, then, lower, the, ships, at, the, other, end, an, average, of, 200, 000, 000, l, 52, 000, 000, us, gal, of, fresh, water, is, used, in, a, single, passing, of, a, ship, the, canal, is, threatened, by, low, water, levels, during, droughts, the, panama, canal, shortcut, greatly, reduces, the, time, for, ships, to, travel, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, enabling, them, to, avoid, the, lengthy, hazardous, route, around, the, southernmost, tip, of, south, america, via, the, drake, passage, or, strait, of, magellan, it, is, one, of, the, largest, and, most, difficult, engineering, projects, ever, undertaken, colombia, france, and, later, the, united, states, controlled, the, territory, surrounding, the, canal, during, construction, france, began, work, on, the, canal, in, 1881, but, stopped, because, of, lack, of, investors, confidence, due, to, engineering, problems, and, a, high, worker, mortality, rate, the, us, took, over, the, project, in, 1904, and, opened, the, canal, in, 1914, the, us, continued, to, control, the, canal, and, surrounding, panama, canal, zone, until, the, torrijos, carter, treaties, provided, for, its, handover, to, panama, in, 1977, after, a, period, of, joint, american, panamanian, control, the, panamanian, government, took, control, in, 1999, it, is, now, managed, and, operated, by, the, panamanian, government, owned, panama, canal, authority, the, original, locks, are, 33, 5, meters, 110, ft, wide, and, allow, the, passage, of, panamax, ships, a, third, wider, lane, of, locks, was, constructed, between, september, 2007, and, may, 2016, the, expanded, waterway, began, commercial, operation, on, 26, june, 2016, the, new, locks, allow, transit, of, larger, neopanamax, ships, annual, traffic, has, risen, from, about, 1, 000, ships, in, 1914, when, the, canal, opened, to, 14, 702, vessels, in, 2008, for, a, total, of, 333, 7, million, panama, canal, universal, measurement, system, pc, ums, tons, by, 2012, more, than, 815, 000, vessels, had, passed, through, the, canal, in, 2017, it, took, ships, an, average, of, 11, 38, hours, to, pass, between, the, canal, s, two, outer, locks, the, american, society, of, civil, engineers, has, ranked, the, panama, canal, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, modern, world, the, earliest, record, regarding, a, canal, across, the, isthmus, of, panama, was, in, 1534, when, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, and, king, of, spain, ordered, a, survey, for, a, route, through, the, americas, in, order, to, ease, the, voyage, for, ships, traveling, between, spain, and, peru, the, spanish, were, seeking, to, gain, a, military, advantage, over, the, portuguese, in, 1668, the, english, physician, and, philosopher, sir, thomas, browne, speculated, in, his, encyclopedic, work, pseudodoxia, epidemica, that, some, isthmus, have, been, eaten, through, by, the, sea, and, others, cut, by, the, spade, and, if, the, policy, would, permit, that, of, panama, in, america, were, most, worthy, the, attempt, it, being, but, few, miles, over, and, would, open, a, shorter, cut, unto, the, east, indies, and, china, given, the, strategic, location, of, panama, and, the, potential, of, its, narrow, isthmus, separating, two, great, oceans, other, trade, links, in, the, area, were, attempted, over, the, years, one, early, example, of, this, was, ill, fated, darien, scheme, launched, by, the, kingdom, of, scotland, in, 1698, to, set, up, an, overland, trade, route, generally, inhospitable, conditions, thwarted, the, effort, and, it, was, abandoned, in, april, 1700, in, 1788, americans, suggested, that, the, spanish, should, build, the, canal, since, they, controlled, the, colonies, where, it, would, be, built, they, said, that, this, would, be, a, less, treacherous, route, for, ships, than, going, around, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, and, that, tropical, ocean, currents, would, naturally, widen, the, canal, after, construction, during, an, expedition, from, 1788, to, 1793, alessandro, malaspina, outlined, plans, for, construction, of, a, canal, numerous, canals, were, built, in, other, countries, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, success, of, the, erie, canal, through, central, new, york, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1820s, and, the, collapse, of, the, spanish, empire, in, latin, america, resulted, in, growing, american, interest, in, building, an, inter, oceanic, canal, beginning, in, 1826, us, officials, began, negotiations, with, gran, colombia, present, day, colombia, venezuela, ecuador, and, panama, hoping, to, gain, a, concession, to, build, a, canal, jealous, of, their, newly, gained, independence, and, fearing, domination, by, the, more, powerful, united, states, president, sim, n, bol, var, and, new, granada, officials, declined, american, offers, after, the, collapse, of, gran, colombia, new, granada, remained, unstable, under, constant, government, intrigue, great, britain, attempted, to, develop, a, canal, in, 1843, according, to, the, new, york, daily, tribune, 24, august, 1843, barings, bank, of, london, and, the, republic, of, new, granada, entered, into, a, contract, for, the, construction, of, a, canal, across, the, isthmus, of, darien, isthmus, of, panama, they, referred, to, it, as, the, atlantic, and, pacific, canal, and, it, was, a, wholly, british, endeavor, projected, for, completion, in, five, years, the, plan, was, never, carried, out, at, nearly, the, same, time, other, ideas, were, floated, including, a, canal, and, or, a, railroad, across, mexico, s, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, that, did, not, develop, either, in, 1846, the, mallarino, bidlack, treaty, negotiated, between, the, us, and, new, granada, granted, the, united, states, transit, rights, and, the, right, to, intervene, militarily, in, the, isthmus, in, 1848, the, discovery, of, gold, in, california, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, generated, renewed, interest, in, a, canal, crossing, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, william, henry, aspinwall, who, had, won, the, federal, subsidy, to, build, and, operate, the, pacific, mail, steamships, at, around, the, same, time, benefited, from, the, gold, discovery, aspinwall, s, route, included, steamship, legs, from, new, york, city, to, panama, and, from, panama, to, california, with, an, overland, portage, through, panama, this, route, with, an, overland, leg, in, panama, was, soon, frequently, traveled, as, it, provided, one, of, the, fastest, connections, between, san, francisco, california, and, the, east, coast, cities, about, 40, days, transit, in, total, nearly, all, the, gold, that, was, shipped, out, of, california, went, by, the, fast, panama, route, several, new, and, larger, paddle, steamers, were, soon, plying, this, new, route, including, private, steamship, lines, owned, by, american, entrepreneur, cornelius, vanderbilt, that, made, use, of, an, overland, route, through, nicaragua, and, the, unfortunate, ss, central, america, in, 1850, the, united, states, began, construction, of, the, panama, railroad, now, called, the, panama, railway, to, cross, the, isthmus, it, opened, in, 1855, this, overland, link, became, a, vital, piece, of, western, hemisphere, infrastructure, greatly, facilitating, trade, the, later, canal, route, was, constructed, parallel, to, it, as, it, had, helped, clear, dense, forests, an, all, water, route, between, the, oceans, was, still, the, goal, in, 1855, william, kennish, a, manx, born, engineer, working, for, the, united, states, government, surveyed, the, isthmus, and, issued, a, report, on, a, route, for, a, proposed, panama, canal, his, report, was, published, as, a, book, entitled, the, practicability, and, importance, of, a, ship, canal, to, connect, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, in, 1876, lucien, napol, on, bonaparte, wyse, and, his, chief, assistant, armand, r, clus, both, officers, and, engineers, of, the, french, navy, explored, several, routes, in, the, darien, atrato, regions, and, made, proposals, including, the, construction, of, tunnels, and, locks, a, second, isthmian, exploratory, visit, began, on, 6, december, 1877, where, two, routes, were, explored, in, panama, the, san, blas, route, and, a, route, from, limon, bay, to, panama, city, the, current, canal, route, the, french, had, achieved, success, in, building, the, suez, canal, in, the, middle, east, while, it, was, a, lengthy, project, they, were, encouraged, to, plan, for, a, canal, to, cross, the, panamanian, isthmus, wyse, went, to, bogot, and, on, 20, march, 1878, signed, a, treaty, in, the, name, of, the, soci, t, civile, internationale, du, canal, interoc, anique, par, l, isthme, du, darien, headed, by, general, tienne, t, rr, with, the, colombian, government, known, as, the, wyse, concession, to, build, an, interoceanic, canal, through, panama, the, first, attempt, to, construct, a, canal, through, what, was, then, colombia, s, province, of, panama, began, on, 1, january, 1881, the, project, was, inspired, by, the, diplomat, ferdinand, de, lesseps, who, was, able, to, raise, considerable, funds, in, france, as, a, result, of, the, huge, profits, generated, by, his, successful, construction, of, the, suez, canal, although, the, panama, canal, needed, to, be, only, 40, percent, as, long, as, the, suez, canal, it, was, much, more, of, an, engineering, challenge, because, of, the, combination, of, tropical, rain, forests, debilitating, climate, the, need, for, canal, locks, and, the, lack, of, any, ancient, route, to, follow, lesseps, wanted, a, sea, level, canal, like, the, suez, but, he, visited, the, site, only, a, few, times, during, the, dry, season, which, lasts, only, four, months, of, the, year, his, men, were, unprepared, for, the, rainy, season, during, which, the, chagres, river, where, the, canal, started, became, a, raging, torrent, rising, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, the, dense, jungle, was, alive, with, venomous, snakes, insects, and, spiders, but, the, worst, challenges, were, yellow, fever, malaria, and, other, tropical, diseases, which, killed, thousands, of, workers, by, 1884, the, death, rate, was, over, 200, per, month, public, health, measures, were, ineffective, because, the, role, of, the, mosquito, as, a, disease, vector, was, then, unknown, conditions, were, downplayed, in, france, to, avoid, recruitment, problems, but, the, high, mortality, rate, made, it, difficult, to, maintain, an, experienced, workforce, workers, had, to, continually, widen, the, main, cut, through, the, mountain, at, culebra, and, reduce, the, angles, of, the, slopes, to, minimize, landslides, into, the, canal, steam, shovels, were, used, in, the, construction, of, the, canal, purchased, from, bay, city, industrial, works, a, business, owned, by, william, l, clements, in, bay, city, michigan, bucket, chain, excavators, manufactured, by, both, alphonse, couvreux, and, wehyer, richemond, and, buette, were, also, used, other, mechanical, and, electrical, equipment, was, limited, in, capabilities, and, steel, equipment, rusted, rapidly, in, the, rainy, climate, in, france, lesseps, kept, the, investment, and, supply, of, workers, flowing, long, after, it, was, obvious, that, the, targets, were, not, being, met, but, eventually, the, money, ran, out, the, french, effort, went, bankrupt, in, 1889, after, reportedly, spending, us, 287, 000, 000, an, estimated, 22, 000, men, died, from, disease, and, accidents, and, the, savings, of, 800, 000, investors, were, lost, work, was, suspended, on, may, 15, and, in, the, ensuing, scandal, known, as, the, panama, affair, some, of, those, deemed, responsible, were, prosecuted, including, gustave, eiffel, lesseps, and, his, son, charles, were, found, guilty, of, misappropriation, of, funds, and, sentenced, to, five, years, imprisonment, this, sentence, was, later, overturned, and, the, father, at, age, 88, was, never, imprisoned, in, 1894, a, second, french, company, the, compagnie, nouvelle, du, canal, de, panama, was, created, to, take, over, the, project, a, minimal, workforce, of, a, few, thousand, people, was, employed, primarily, to, comply, with, the, terms, of, the, colombian, panama, canal, concession, to, run, the, panama, railroad, and, to, maintain, the, existing, excavation, and, equipment, in, salable, condition, the, company, sought, a, buyer, for, these, assets, with, an, asking, price, of, us, 109, 000, 000, in, the, meantime, they, continued, with, enough, activity, to, maintain, their, franchise, phillipe, bunau, varilla, the, french, manager, of, the, new, panama, canal, company, eventually, managed, to, persuade, lesseps, that, a, lock, and, lake, canal, was, more, realistic, than, a, sea, level, canal, the, comit, technique, a, high, level, technical, committee, was, formed, by, the, compagnie, nouvelle, to, review, the, studies, and, work, that, already, finished, and, that, still, ongoing, and, come, up, with, the, best, plan, for, completing, the, canal, the, committee, arrived, on, the, isthmus, in, february, 1896, and, went, immediately, quietly, and, efficiently, about, their, work, of, devising, the, best, possible, canal, plan, which, they, presented, on, 16, november, 1898, many, aspects, of, the, plan, were, similar, in, principle, to, the, canal, that, was, finally, built, by, the, americans, in, 1914, it, was, a, lock, canal, with, two, high, level, lakes, to, lift, ships, up, and, over, the, continental, divide, double, locks, would, be, 738, feet, long, and, about, 30, feet, deep, 225, m, 9, m, one, chamber, of, each, pair, would, be, 82, feet, 25, m, wide, the, other, 59, ft, 18, m, there, would, be, eight, sets, of, locks, two, at, bohio, soldado, and, two, at, obispo, on, the, atlantic, side, one, at, paraiso, two, at, pedro, miguel, and, one, at, miraflores, on, the, pacific, artificial, lakes, would, be, formed, by, damming, the, chagres, river, at, bohio, and, alhajuela, providing, both, flood, control, and, electric, power, at, this, time, the, president, and, the, senate, of, the, united, states, were, interested, in, establishing, a, canal, across, the, isthmus, with, some, favoring, a, canal, across, nicaragua, and, others, advocating, the, purchase, of, the, french, interests, in, panama, bunau, varilla, who, was, seeking, american, involvement, asked, for, 100, million, but, accepted, 40, million, in, the, face, of, the, nicaraguan, option, in, june, 1902, the, us, senate, voted, in, favor, of, the, spooner, act, to, pursue, the, panamanian, option, provided, the, necessary, rights, could, be, obtained, on, 22, january, 1903, the, hay, herr, n, treaty, was, signed, by, united, states, secretary, of, state, john, m, hay, and, colombian, charg, tom, s, herr, n, for, 10, million, and, an, annual, payment, it, would, have, granted, the, united, states, a, renewable, lease, in, perpetuity, from, colombia, on, the, land, proposed, for, the, canal, the, treaty, was, ratified, by, the, us, senate, on, 14, march, 1903, but, the, senate, of, colombia, unanimously, rejected, the, treaty, since, it, had, become, significantly, unpopular, in, bogot, due, to, concerns, over, insufficient, compensation, threat, to, sovereignty, and, perpetuity, roosevelt, changed, tactics, based, in, part, on, the, mallarino, bidlack, treaty, of, 1846, and, actively, supported, the, separation, of, panama, from, colombia, shortly, after, recognizing, panama, he, signed, a, treaty, with, the, new, panamanian, government, under, terms, similar, to, the, hay, herr, n, treaty, on, 2, november, 1903, us, warships, blocked, sea, lanes, against, possible, colombian, troop, movements, en, route, to, put, down, the, panama, rebellion, panama, declared, independence, on, 3, november, 1903, the, united, states, quickly, recognized, the, new, nation, this, happened, so, quickly, that, by, the, time, the, colombian, government, in, bogot, launched, a, response, to, the, panamanian, uprising, us, troops, had, already, entered, the, rebelling, province, the, colombian, troops, dispatched, to, panama, were, hastily, assembled, conscripts, with, little, training, while, these, conscripts, may, have, been, able, to, defeat, the, panamanian, rebels, they, would, not, have, been, able, to, defeat, the, us, army, troops, that, were, supporting, the, panamanian, rebels, the, reason, an, army, of, conscripts, was, sent, was, that, it, was, the, best, response, the, colombians, could, muster, as, colombia, still, was, recovering, from, a, civil, war, between, liberals, and, conservatives, from, october, 1899, to, november, 1902, known, as, the, thousand, days, war, the, us, was, fully, aware, of, these, conditions, and, even, incorporated, them, into, the, planning, of, the, panama, intervention, as, the, us, acted, as, an, arbitrator, between, the, two, sides, the, peace, treaty, that, ended, the, thousand, days, war, was, signed, on, the, uss, wisconsin, on, 21, november, 1902, while, in, port, the, us, also, brought, engineering, teams, to, panama, with, the, peace, delegation, to, begin, planning, the, canal, s, construction, before, the, us, had, even, gained, the, rights, to, build, the, canal, all, these, factors, would, result, in, the, colombians, being, unable, to, put, down, the, panamanian, rebellion, and, expel, the, united, states, troops, occupying, what, today, is, the, independent, nation, of, panama, on, 6, november, 1903, philippe, bunau, varilla, as, panama, s, ambassador, to, the, united, states, signed, the, hay, bunau, varilla, treaty, granting, rights, to, the, united, states, to, build, and, indefinitely, administer, the, panama, canal, zone, and, its, defenses, this, is, sometimes, misinterpreted, as, the, 99, year, lease, because, of, misleading, wording, included, in, article, 22, of, the, agreement, almost, immediately, the, treaty, was, condemned, by, many, panamanians, as, an, infringement, on, their, country, s, new, national, sovereignty, this, would, later, become, a, contentious, diplomatic, issue, among, colombia, panama, and, the, united, states, president, roosevelt, famously, stated, i, took, the, isthmus, started, the, canal, and, then, left, congress, not, to, debate, the, canal, but, to, debate, me, several, parties, in, the, united, states, called, this, an, act, of, war, on, colombia, the, new, york, times, described, the, support, given, by, the, united, states, to, bunau, varilla, as, an, act, of, sordid, conquest, the, new, york, evening, post, called, it, a, vulgar, and, mercenary, venture, the, us, maneuvers, are, often, cited, as, the, classic, example, of, us, gunboat, diplomacy, in, latin, america, and, the, best, illustration, of, what, roosevelt, meant, by, the, old, african, adage, speak, softly, and, carry, a, big, stick, you, will, go, far, after, the, revolution, in, 1903, the, republic, of, panama, became, a, us, protectorate, until, 1939, in, 1904, the, united, states, purchased, the, french, equipment, and, excavations, including, the, panama, railroad, for, us, 40, million, of, which, 30, million, related, to, excavations, completed, primarily, in, the, culebra, cut, valued, at, about, 1, 00, per, cubic, yard, the, united, states, also, paid, the, new, country, of, panama, 10, million, and, a, 250, 000, payment, each, following, year, in, 1921, colombia, and, the, united, states, entered, into, the, thomson, urrutia, treaty, in, which, the, united, states, agreed, to, pay, colombia, 25, million, 5, million, upon, ratification, and, four, 5, million, annual, payments, and, grant, colombia, special, privileges, in, the, canal, zone, in, return, colombia, recognized, panama, as, an, independent, nation, the, us, formally, took, control, of, the, canal, property, on, 4, may, 1904, inheriting, from, the, french, a, depleted, workforce, and, a, vast, jumble, of, buildings, infrastructure, and, equipment, much, of, it, in, poor, condition, a, us, government, commission, the, isthmian, canal, commission, icc, was, established, to, oversee, construction, it, was, given, control, of, the, panama, canal, zone, over, which, the, united, states, exercised, sovereignty, the, commission, reported, directly, to, secretary, of, war, william, howard, taft, and, was, directed, to, avoid, the, inefficiency, and, corruption, that, had, plagued, the, french, 15, years, earlier, on, 6, may, 1904, president, theodore, roosevelt, appointed, john, findley, wallace, formerly, chief, engineer, and, finally, general, manager, of, the, illinois, central, railroad, as, chief, engineer, of, the, panama, canal, project, overwhelmed, by, the, disease, plagued, country, and, forced, to, use, often, dilapidated, french, infrastructure, and, equipment, as, well, as, being, frustrated, by, the, overly, bureaucratic, icc, wallace, resigned, abruptly, in, june, 1905, the, icc, brought, on, a, new, chairman, theodore, p, shonts, and, a, new, chief, engineer, was, appointed, john, frank, stevens, a, self, educated, engineer, who, had, built, the, great, northern, railroad, stevens, was, not, a, member, of, the, icc, he, increasingly, viewed, its, bureaucracy, as, a, serious, hindrance, bypassing, the, commission, and, sending, requests, and, demands, directly, to, the, roosevelt, administration, in, washington, dc, one, of, stevens, first, achievements, in, panama, was, in, building, and, rebuilding, the, housing, cafeterias, hotels, water, systems, repair, shops, warehouses, and, other, infrastructure, needed, by, the, thousands, of, incoming, workers, stevens, began, the, recruitment, effort, to, entice, thousands, of, workers, from, the, united, states, and, other, areas, to, come, to, the, canal, zone, to, work, workers, from, the, caribbean, called, afro, panamanians, came, in, large, numbers, and, many, settled, permanently, stevens, tried, to, provide, accommodation, in, which, the, workers, could, work, and, live, in, reasonable, safety, and, comfort, he, also, re, established, and, enlarged, the, railway, which, was, to, prove, crucial, in, transporting, millions, of, tons, of, soil, from, the, cut, through, the, mountains, to, the, dam, across, the, chagres, river, colonel, william, c, gorgas, had, been, appointed, chief, sanitation, officer, of, the, canal, construction, project, in, 1904, gorgas, implemented, a, range, of, measures, to, minimize, the, spread, of, deadly, diseases, particularly, yellow, fever, and, malaria, which, had, recently, been, shown, to, be, mosquito, borne, following, the, work, of, cuban, epidemiologist, carlos, finlay, and, american, pathologist, walter, reed, investment, was, made, in, extensive, sanitation, projects, including, city, water, systems, fumigation, of, buildings, spraying, of, insect, breeding, areas, with, oil, and, larvicide, installation, of, mosquito, netting, and, window, screens, and, elimination, of, stagnant, water, despite, opposition, from, the, commission, one, member, said, his, ideas, were, barmy, gorgas, persisted, and, when, stevens, arrived, he, threw, his, weight, behind, the, project, after, two, years, of, extensive, work, the, mosquito, spread, diseases, were, nearly, eliminated, despite, the, monumental, effort, about, 5, 600, workers, died, from, disease, and, accidents, during, the, us, construction, phase, of, the, canal, besides, healthier, and, far, better, living, conditions, for, the, workers, another, benefit, given, to, american, citizens, working, on, the, canal, was, a, medal, for, two, years, of, service, additional, bars, were, added, for, each, two, year, period, after, that, designed, by, victor, d, brenner, and, featuring, the, then, current, president, they, were, popularly, known, as, the, roosevelt, medal, a, total, of, 7189, were, ultimately, issued, with, a, few, people, receiving, as, many, as, four, bars, certificates, are, available, today, in, 1905, a, us, engineering, panel, was, commissioned, to, review, the, canal, design, which, had, not, been, finalized, in, january, 1906, the, panel, in, a, majority, of, eight, to, five, recommended, to, president, roosevelt, a, sea, level, canal, as, had, been, attempted, by, the, french, and, temporarily, abandoned, by, them, in, 1887, for, a, ten, locks, system, designed, by, philippe, bunau, varilla, and, definitively, in, 1898, for, a, lock, and, lake, canal, designed, by, the, comit, technique, of, the, compagnie, nouvelle, de, canal, de, panama, as, conceptualized, by, adolphe, godin, de, l, pinay, in, 1879, but, in, 1906, stevens, who, had, seen, the, chagres, in, full, flood, was, summoned, to, washington, he, declared, a, sea, level, approach, to, be, an, entirely, untenable, proposition, he, argued, in, favor, of, a, canal, using, a, lock, system, to, raise, and, lower, ships, from, a, large, reservoir, 85, ft, 26, m, above, sea, level, this, would, create, both, the, largest, dam, gatun, dam, and, the, largest, human, made, lake, gatun, lake, in, the, world, at, that, time, the, water, to, refill, the, locks, would, be, taken, from, gatun, lake, by, opening, and, closing, enormous, gates, and, valves, and, letting, gravity, propel, the, water, from, the, lake, gatun, lake, would, connect, to, the, pacific, through, the, mountains, at, the, gaillard, culebra, cut, unlike, godin, de, l, pinay, with, the, congr, s, international, d, etudes, du, canal, interoc, anique, stevens, successfully, convinced, roosevelt, of, the, necessity, and, feasibility, of, this, alternative, scheme, the, construction, of, a, canal, with, locks, required, the, excavation, of, more, than, 17, million, cu, yd, 13, million, m, 3, of, material, over, and, above, the, 30, million, cu, yd, 23, million, m, 3, excavated, by, the, french, as, quickly, as, possible, the, americans, replaced, or, upgraded, the, old, unusable, french, equipment, with, new, construction, equipment, that, was, designed, for, a, much, larger, and, faster, scale, of, work, 102, large, railroad, mounted, steam, shovels, were, purchased, 77, from, bucyrus, erie, and, 25, from, the, marion, power, shovel, company, these, were, joined, by, enormous, steam, powered, cranes, giant, hydraulic, rock, crushers, concrete, mixers, dredges, and, pneumatic, power, drills, nearly, all, of, which, were, manufactured, by, new, extensive, machine, building, technology, developed, and, built, in, the, united, states, the, railroad, also, had, to, be, comprehensively, upgraded, with, heavy, duty, double, tracked, rails, over, most, of, the, line, to, accommodate, new, rolling, stock, in, many, places, the, new, gatun, lake, flooded, over, the, original, rail, line, and, a, new, line, had, to, be, constructed, above, gatun, lake, s, waterline, between, 1912, and, 1914, there, was, a, controversy, about, the, tolls, for, the, canal, in, 1907, stevens, resigned, as, chief, engineer, his, replacement, appointed, by, president, theodore, roosevelt, was, us, army, major, george, washington, goethals, of, the, us, army, corps, of, engineers, soon, to, be, promoted, to, lieutenant, colonel, and, later, to, general, he, was, a, strong, west, point, trained, leader, and, civil, engineer, with, experience, in, canals, unlike, stevens, goethals, directed, the, work, in, panama, to, a, successful, conclusion, in, 1914, two, years, ahead, of, the, target, date, of, 10, june, 1916, goethals, divided, the, engineering, and, excavation, work, into, three, divisions, atlantic, central, and, pacific, the, atlantic, division, under, major, william, l, sibert, was, responsible, for, construction, of, the, massive, breakwater, at, the, entrance, to, limon, bay, the, gatun, locks, and, their, 3, 1, 2, mile, 5, 6, km, approach, channel, and, the, immense, gatun, dam, the, pacific, division, under, sydney, b, williamson, the, only, civilian, member, of, this, high, level, team, was, similarly, responsible, for, the, pacific, 3, mile, 4, 8, km, breakwater, in, panama, bay, the, approach, channel, to, the, locks, and, the, miraflores, and, pedro, miguel, locks, and, their, associated, dams, and, reservoirs, the, central, division, under, major, david, du, bose, gaillard, of, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, was, assigned, one, of, the, most, difficult, parts, excavating, the, culebra, cut, through, the, continental, divide, to, connect, gatun, lake, to, the, pacific, panama, canal, locks, on, 10, october, 1913, president, woodrow, wilson, sent, a, signal, from, the, white, house, by, telegraph, which, triggered, the, explosion, that, destroyed, the, gamboa, dike, this, flooded, the, culebra, cut, thereby, joining, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, via, the, panama, canal, alexandre, la, valley, a, floating, crane, built, by, lobnitz, company, and, launched, in, 1887, was, the, first, self, propelled, vessel, to, transit, the, canal, from, ocean, to, ocean, this, vessel, crossed, the, canal, from, the, atlantic, in, stages, during, construction, finally, reaching, the, pacific, on, 7, january, 1914, ss, cristobal, a, cargo, and, passenger, ship, built, by, maryland, steel, and, launched, in, 1902, as, ss, tremont, on, 3, august, 1914, was, the, first, ship, to, transit, the, canal, from, ocean, to, ocean, the, construction, of, the, canal, was, completed, in, 1914, 401, years, after, panama, was, first, crossed, overland, by, the, europeans, in, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, s, party, of, conquistadores, the, united, states, spent, almost, 500, million, roughly, equivalent, to, 15, 2, billion, in, 2023, to, finish, the, project, this, was, by, far, the, largest, american, engineering, project, to, date, the, canal, was, formally, opened, on, 15, august, 1914, with, the, passage, of, the, cargo, ship, ss, ancon, the, opening, of, the, panama, canal, in, 1914, caused, a, severe, drop, in, traffic, along, chilean, ports, due, to, shifts, in, maritime, trade, routes, despite, the, closure, of, the, canal, for, nearly, seven, months, after, a, landslide, in, the, culebra, cut, on, 18, september, 1915, the, burgeoning, sheep, farming, business, in, southern, patagonia, suffered, a, significant, setback, by, the, change, in, trade, routes, as, did, the, economy, of, the, falkland, islands, throughout, this, time, ernest, red, hallen, was, hired, by, the, isthmian, canal, commission, to, document, the, progress, of, the, work, in, 1914, steam, shovels, from, the, panama, canal, were, purchased, and, put, to, use, in, chuquicamata, copper, mine, of, northern, chile, by, the, 1930s, water, supply, became, an, issue, for, the, canal, prompting, construction, of, the, madden, dam, across, the, chagres, river, above, gatun, lake, completed, in, 1935, the, dam, created, madden, lake, later, alajuela, lake, which, provides, additional, water, storage, for, the, canal, in, 1939, construction, began, on, a, further, major, improvement, a, new, set, of, locks, large, enough, to, carry, the, larger, warships, that, the, united, states, was, building, at, the, time, and, planned, to, continue, building, the, work, proceeded, for, several, years, and, significant, excavation, was, carried, out, on, the, new, approach, channels, but, the, project, was, canceled, after, world, war, ii, after, world, war, ii, us, control, of, the, canal, and, the, canal, zone, surrounding, it, became, contentious, relations, between, panama, and, the, united, states, became, increasingly, tense, many, panamanians, felt, that, the, zone, rightfully, belonged, to, panama, student, protests, were, met, by, the, fencing, in, of, the, zone, and, an, increased, military, presence, there, demands, for, the, united, states, to, hand, over, the, canal, to, panama, increased, after, the, suez, crisis, in, 1956, when, the, united, states, used, financial, and, diplomatic, pressure, to, force, france, and, the, uk, to, abandon, their, attempt, to, retake, control, of, the, suez, canal, previously, nationalized, by, the, nasser, regime, in, egypt, panamanian, unrest, culminated, in, riots, on, martyr, s, day, 9, january, 1964, when, about, 20, panamanians, and, 3, 5, us, soldiers, were, killed, a, decade, later, in, 1974, negotiations, toward, a, settlement, began, and, resulted, in, the, torrijos, carter, treaties, on, 7, september, 1977, the, treaty, was, signed, by, president, of, the, united, states, jimmy, carter, and, omar, torrijos, de, facto, leader, of, panama, this, mobilized, the, process, of, granting, the, panamanians, free, control, of, the, canal, so, long, as, panama, signed, a, treaty, guaranteeing, the, permanent, neutrality, of, the, canal, the, treaty, led, to, full, panamanian, control, effective, at, noon, on, 31, december, 1999, and, the, panama, canal, authority, acp, assumed, command, of, the, waterway, the, panama, canal, remains, one, of, the, chief, revenue, sources, for, panama, before, this, handover, the, government, of, panama, held, an, international, bid, to, negotiate, a, 25, year, contract, for, operation, of, the, container, shipping, ports, located, at, the, canal, s, atlantic, and, pacific, outlets, the, contract, was, not, affiliated, with, the, acp, or, panama, canal, operations, and, was, won, by, the, firm, hutchison, whampoa, a, hong, kong, based, shipping, interest, owned, by, li, ka, shing, while, globally, the, atlantic, ocean, is, east, of, the, isthmus, and, the, pacific, is, west, the, general, direction, of, the, canal, passage, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, is, from, northwest, to, southeast, because, of, the, shape, of, the, isthmus, at, the, point, the, canal, occupies, the, bridge, of, the, americas, spanish, puente, de, las, am, ricas, at, the, pacific, side, is, about, a, third, of, a, degree, east, of, the, col, n, end, on, the, atlantic, side, still, in, formal, nautical, communications, the, simplified, directions, southbound, and, northbound, are, used, the, canal, consists, of, artificial, lakes, several, improved, and, artificial, channels, and, three, sets, of, locks, an, additional, artificial, lake, alajuela, lake, known, during, the, american, era, as, madden, lake, acts, as, a, reservoir, for, the, canal, the, layout, of, the, canal, as, seen, by, a, ship, passing, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, is, thus, the, total, length, of, the, canal, is, 80, km, 50, mi, in, 2017, it, took, ships, an, average, of, 11, 38, hours, to, pass, between, the, canal, s, two, outer, locks, download, coordinates, as, created, in, 1913, by, damming, the, chagres, river, the, gatun, lake, is, a, key, part, of, the, panama, canal, providing, the, millions, of, liters, of, water, necessary, to, operate, its, locks, each, time, a, ship, passes, through, at, time, of, formation, gatun, lake, was, the, largest, human, made, lake, in, the, world, because, of, the, importance, of, the, canal, to, international, trade, many, ships, are, built, to, the, maximum, size, allowed, for, its, first, century, the, width, and, length, of, ships, that, may, transit, the, canal, was, limited, by, the, pedro, miguel, locks, their, draft, by, the, canal, s, minimum, 12, 6, m, 41, 2, ft, depth, and, their, height, by, the, main, span, of, the, bridge, of, the, americas, at, balboa, ships, built, to, those, limits, are, known, as, panamax, vessels, a, panamax, cargo, ship, typically, has, a, deadweight, tonnage, dwt, of, 65, 000, 80, 000, tons, but, its, actual, cargo, is, restricted, to, about, 52, 500, tons, because, of, the, canal, s, draft, restrictions, within, the, canal, the, longest, ship, ever, to, transit, the, canal, was, the, san, juan, prospector, now, marcona, prospector, an, ore, bulk, oil, carrier, that, is, 296, 57, m, 973, ft, long, with, a, beam, of, 32, 31, m, 106, ft, initially, the, locks, at, gatun, were, designed, to, be, 28, 5, m, 94, ft, wide, in, 1908, the, united, states, navy, requested, that, the, width, be, increased, to, at, least, 36, m, 118, ft, to, allow, the, passage, of, large, warships, a, compromise, was, made, and, the, locks, were, built, 33, 53, m, 110, 0, ft, wide, each, lock, is, 320, m, 1, 050, ft, long, with, the, walls, ranging, in, thickness, from, 15, m, 49, ft, at, the, base, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, at, the, top, the, central, wall, between, the, parallel, locks, at, gatun, is, 18, m, 59, ft, thick, and, over, 24, m, 79, ft, high, the, steel, lock, gates, measure, an, average, of, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, thick, 19, 5, m, 64, ft, wide, and, 20, m, 66, ft, high, panama, canal, pilots, were, initially, unprepared, to, handle, the, flight, decks, of, aircraft, carriers, which, protrude, beyond, the, hull, on, either, side, of, the, ship, when, uss, saratoga, made, her, first, trip, through, the, gatun, locks, in, 1928, the, ship, knocked, over, all, the, concrete, lamp, posts, along, the, canal, in, 2016, a, decade, long, expansion, project, created, larger, locks, allowing, bigger, ships, to, transit, through, deeper, and, wider, channels, the, allowed, dimensions, of, ships, using, these, locks, increased, by, 25, percent, in, length, 51, percent, in, beam, and, 26, percent, in, draft, as, defined, by, neopanamax, metrics, as, with, a, toll, road, vessels, transiting, the, canal, must, pay, tolls, tolls, for, the, canal, are, set, by, the, panama, canal, authority, and, are, based, on, vessel, type, size, and, the, type, of, cargo, for, container, ships, the, toll, is, assessed, on, the, ship, s, capacity, expressed, in, twenty, foot, equivalent, units, teus, one, teu, being, the, size, of, a, standard, intermodal, shipping, container, effective, 1, april, 2016, this, toll, went, from, us, 74, per, loaded, container, to, 60, per, teu, capacity, plus, 30, per, loaded, container, for, a, potential, 90, per, teu, when, the, ship, is, full, a, panamax, container, ship, may, carry, up, to, 4, 400, teu, the, toll, is, calculated, differently, for, passenger, ships, and, for, container, ships, carrying, no, cargo, in, ballast, as, of, april, 1, 2016, the, ballast, rate, is, us, 60, down, from, us, 65, 60, per, teu, passenger, vessels, in, excess, of, 30, 000, tons, pc, ums, pay, a, rate, based, on, the, number, of, berths, that, is, the, number, of, passengers, that, can, be, accommodated, in, permanent, beds, since, 1, april, 2016, the, per, berth, charge, is, 111, for, unoccupied, berths, and, 138, for, occupied, berths, in, the, panamax, locks, starting, in, 2007, this, fee, has, greatly, increased, the, tolls, for, such, ships, passenger, vessels, of, less, than, 30, 000, tons, or, less, than, 33, tons, per, passenger, are, charged, according, to, the, same, per, ton, schedule, as, are, freighters, almost, all, major, cruise, ships, have, more, than, 33, tons, per, passenger, the, rule, of, thumb, for, cruise, line, comfort, is, generally, given, as, a, minimum, of, 40, tons, per, passenger, most, other, types, of, vessels, pay, a, toll, per, pc, ums, net, ton, in, which, one, ton, is, actually, a, volume, of, 100, cubic, feet, 2, 83, m, 3, the, calculation, of, tonnage, for, commercial, vessels, is, quite, complex, as, of, fiscal, year, 2016, this, toll, is, us, 5, 25, per, ton, for, the, first, 10, 000, tons, us, 5, 14, per, ton, for, the, next, 10, 000, tons, and, us, 5, 06, per, ton, thereafter, as, with, container, ships, reduced, tolls, are, charged, for, freight, ships, in, ballast, 4, 19, 4, 12, 4, 05, respectively, on, 1, april, 2016, a, more, complicated, toll, system, was, introduced, having, the, neopanamax, locks, at, a, higher, rate, in, some, cases, natural, gas, transport, as, a, new, separate, category, and, other, changes, as, of, 1, october, 2017, there, are, modified, tolls, and, categories, of, tolls, in, effect, small, less, than, 125, ft, vessels, up, to, 583, pc, ums, net, tons, when, carrying, passengers, or, cargo, or, up, to, 735, pc, ums, net, tons, when, in, ballast, or, up, to, 1, 048, fully, loaded, displacement, tons, are, assessed, minimum, tolls, based, upon, their, length, overall, according, to, the, following, table, as, of, 29, april, 2015, morgan, adams, of, los, angeles, california, holds, the, distinction, of, paying, the, first, toll, received, by, the, u, s, government, for, the, use, of, the, panama, canal, by, a, pleasure, boat, his, boat, lasata, passed, through, the, zone, on, 14, august, 1914, the, crossing, occurred, during, a, 10, 000, kilometer, 6, 000, mile, sea, voyage, from, jacksonville, florida, to, los, angeles, in, 1914, the, most, expensive, regular, toll, for, canal, passage, to, date, was, charged, on, 14, april, 2010, to, the, cruise, ship, norwegian, pearl, which, paid, us, 375, 600, the, average, toll, is, around, us, 54, 000, the, highest, fee, for, priority, passage, charged, through, the, transit, slot, auction, system, was, us, 220, 300, paid, on, 24, august, 2006, by, the, panamax, tanker, erikoussa, bypassing, a, 90, ship, queue, waiting, for, the, end, of, maintenance, work, on, the, gatun, locks, and, thus, avoiding, a, seven, day, delay, the, normal, fee, would, have, been, just, us, 13, 430, the, lowest, toll, ever, paid, was, 36, cents, equivalent, to, 6, 39, in, 2023, by, american, richard, halliburton, who, swam, the, panama, canal, in, 1928, opponents, to, the, 1977, torrijos, carter, treaties, feared, that, efficiency, and, maintenance, would, suffer, following, the, u, s, withdrawal, from, the, panama, canal, zone, however, this, has, been, proven, not, to, be, the, case, in, 2004, it, was, reported, that, canal, operations, capitalizing, on, practices, developed, during, the, american, administration, were, improving, under, panamanian, control, canal, waters, time, cwt, the, average, time, it, takes, a, vessel, to, navigate, the, canal, including, waiting, time, is, a, key, measure, of, efficiency, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 2000s, it, ranged, between, 20, and, 30, hours, according, to, the, acp, the, accident, rate, has, also, not, changed, appreciably, in, the, past, decade, varying, between, 10, and, 30, accidents, each, year, from, about, 14, 000, total, annual, transits, an, official, accident, is, one, in, which, a, formal, investigation, is, requested, and, conducted, increasing, volumes, of, imports, from, asia, which, previously, landed, on, us, west, coast, ports, are, now, passing, through, the, canal, to, the, american, east, coast, the, total, number, of, ocean, going, transits, increased, from, 11, 725, in, 2003, to, 13, 233, in, 2007, falling, to, 12, 855, in, 2009, the, canal, s, fiscal, year, runs, from, october, through, september, this, has, been, coupled, with, a, steady, rise, in, average, ship, size, and, in, the, numbers, of, panamax, vessels, passing, through, the, canal, so, that, the, total, tonnage, carried, rose, from, 227, 9, million, pc, ums, tons, in, fiscal, year, 1999, to, a, then, record, high, of, 312, 9, million, tons, in, 2007, and, falling, to, 299, 1, million, tons, in, 2009, tonnage, for, fiscal, 2013, 2014, and, 2015, was, 320, 6, 326, 8, and, 340, 8, million, pc, ums, tons, carried, on, 13, 660, 13, 481, and, 13, 874, transits, respectively, in, the, first, decade, after, the, transfer, to, panamanian, control, the, panama, canal, authority, acp, invested, nearly, us, 1, billion, in, widening, and, modernizing, the, canal, with, the, aim, of, increasing, capacity, by, 20, percent, the, acp, cites, a, number, of, major, improvements, including, the, widening, and, straightening, of, the, culebra, cut, to, reduce, restrictions, on, passing, vessels, the, deepening, of, the, navigational, channel, in, gatun, lake, to, reduce, draft, restrictions, and, improve, water, supply, and, the, deepening, of, the, atlantic, and, pacific, entrances, to, the, canal, this, is, supported, by, new, equipment, such, as, a, new, drill, barge, and, suction, dredger, and, an, increase, of, the, tug, boat, fleet, by, 20, percent, in, addition, improvements, have, been, made, to, the, canal, s, operating, machinery, including, an, increased, and, improved, tug, locomotive, fleet, the, replacement, of, more, than, 16, km, 10, mi, of, locomotive, track, and, new, lock, machinery, controls, improvements, have, been, made, to, the, traffic, management, system, to, allow, more, efficient, control, over, ships, in, the, canal, in, december, 2010, record, breaking, rains, caused, a, 17, hour, closure, of, the, canal, this, was, the, first, closure, since, the, u, s, invasion, of, panama, in, 1989, the, rains, also, caused, an, access, road, to, the, centenario, bridge, to, collapse, the, canal, handles, more, vessel, traffic, than, had, ever, been, envisioned, by, its, builders, in, 1934, it, was, estimated, that, the, maximum, capacity, of, the, canal, would, be, around, 80, million, tons, per, year, as, noted, above, canal, traffic, in, 2015, reached, 340, 8, million, tons, of, shipping, to, improve, capacity, a, number, of, improvements, have, been, made, to, maximize, the, use, of, the, locking, system, these, improvements, enlarged, the, capacity, from, 300, million, pcums, 2008, to, 340, pcums, 2012, these, improvements, were, started, before, the, new, locks, project, and, are, complementary, to, it, the, canal, faces, increasing, competition, from, other, quarters, because, canal, tolls, have, risen, as, ships, have, become, larger, some, critics, have, suggested, that, the, suez, canal, is, now, a, viable, alternative, for, cargo, between, asia, and, the, us, east, coast, the, panama, canal, however, continues, to, serve, more, than, 144, of, the, world, s, trade, routes, and, the, majority, of, canal, traffic, comes, from, the, all, water, route, from, asia, to, the, us, east, and, gulf, coasts, an, alternative, route, through, nicaragua, and, lake, nicaragua, has, been, proposed, on, 15, june, 2013, nicaragua, awarded, the, hong, kong, based, hknd, group, a, 50, year, concession, to, develop, a, canal, through, the, country, in, february, 2018, analysts, widely, viewed, the, project, as, defunct, though, the, head, of, the, project, insisted, work, was, on, going, in, april, 2018, hknd, group, closed, its, offices, leaving, no, forwarding, address, or, telephone, numbers, to, be, reached, the, increasing, rate, of, melting, of, ice, in, the, arctic, ocean, has, led, to, speculation, that, the, northwest, passage, or, arctic, bridge, may, become, viable, for, commercial, shipping, this, route, would, save, 9, 300, km, 5, 800, mi, on, the, route, from, asia, to, europe, compared, with, the, panama, canal, possibly, leading, to, a, diversion, of, some, traffic, to, that, route, however, such, a, route, is, beset, by, unresolved, territorial, issues, and, would, still, hold, significant, problems, owing, to, ice, gatun, lake, is, filled, with, rainwater, and, the, lake, accumulates, excess, water, during, wet, months, for, the, old, locks, water, is, lost, to, the, oceans, at, a, rate, of, 101, 000, m, 3, 26, 7, million, us, gal, 81, 9, acre, ft, per, downward, lock, movement, the, ship, s, submerged, volume, is, not, relevant, to, this, amount, of, water, during, the, dry, season, when, there, is, less, rainfall, there, is, also, a, shortage, of, water, in, gatun, lake, as, a, signatory, to, the, 2000, united, nations, global, compact, and, member, of, the, world, business, council, for, sustainable, development, the, acp, developed, an, environmentally, and, socially, sustainable, program, for, expansion, which, protects, the, aquatic, and, terrestrial, resources, of, the, canal, watershed, the, expansion, uses, three, water, saving, basins, at, each, new, lock, diminishing, water, loss, it, also, preserves, freshwater, resources, along, the, waterway, by, reusing, 60, percent, of, water, from, the, basins, in, the, locks, in, each, transit, the, mean, sea, level, at, the, pacific, side, is, about, 20, cm, 8, in, higher, than, that, of, the, atlantic, side, due, to, differences, in, ocean, conditions, such, as, water, density, and, weather, the, 2015, 16, fiscal, year, was, one, of, the, driest, periods, on, record, restricting, ships, passage, 2019, was, the, fifth, driest, year, for, 70, years, temperature, rise, has, also, caused, an, increase, in, evaporation, in, normal, times, 36, ships, can, transit, the, canal, each, day, but, in, early, december, 2023, ships, were, backing, up, because, only, 22, ships, per, day, could, transit, due, to, low, water, levels, in, january, 2024, 24, ships, per, day, were, allowed, to, transit, as, demand, is, rising, for, efficient, global, shipping, of, goods, the, canal, is, positioned, to, be, a, significant, feature, of, world, shipping, for, the, foreseeable, future, however, changes, in, shipping, patterns, particularly, the, increasing, numbers, of, larger, than, panamax, ships, necessitated, changes, to, the, canal, for, it, to, retain, a, significant, market, share, in, 2006, it, was, anticipated, that, by, 2011, 37, percent, of, the, world, s, container, ships, would, be, too, large, for, the, present, canal, and, hence, a, failure, to, expand, would, result, in, a, significant, loss, of, market, share, the, maximum, sustainable, capacity, of, the, original, canal, given, some, relatively, minor, improvement, work, was, estimated, at, 340, million, pc, ums, tons, per, year, it, was, anticipated, that, this, capacity, would, be, reached, between, 2009, and, 2012, close, to, 50, percent, of, transiting, vessels, were, already, using, the, full, width, of, the, locks, an, enlargement, scheme, to, allow, for, a, greater, number, of, transits, and, the, ability, to, handle, larger, ships, similar, to, the, third, lock, scheme, of, 1939, had, been, under, consideration, for, some, time, and, by, 2006, panama, s, government, canal, authority, was, recommending, such, a, plan, the, expansion, proposal, with, a, cost, estimate, of, us, 5, 25, billion, was, expected, to, double, the, canal, s, shipping, capacity, by, allowing, both, the, passage, of, longer, and, wider, post, panamax, ships, and, an, increase, in, overall, traffic, this, proposal, was, approved, in, a, national, referendum, by, about, 80, percent, on, 22, october, 2006, the, canal, expansion, was, built, between, 2007, and, 2016, the, expansion, plan, had, two, new, flights, of, locks, built, parallel, to, and, operated, in, addition, to, the, old, locks, one, east, of, the, existing, gatun, locks, and, one, southwest, of, the, miraflores, locks, each, supported, by, approach, channels, each, flight, ascends, from, sea, level, directly, to, the, level, of, gatun, lake, the, existing, two, stage, ascent, at, miraflores, and, pedro, miguel, locks, was, not, replicated, the, new, lock, chambers, feature, sliding, gates, doubled, for, safety, and, are, 427, m, 1, 400, ft, long, 55, m, 180, ft, wide, and, 18, 3, m, 60, ft, deep, this, allows, the, transit, of, vessels, with, a, beam, of, up, to, 49, m, 160, ft, an, overall, length, of, up, to, 366, m, 1, 200, ft, and, a, draft, of, up, to, 15, m, 49, ft, equivalent, to, a, container, ship, carrying, around, 12, 000, containers, each, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, in, length, teu, the, new, locks, are, supported, by, new, approach, channels, including, a, 6, 2, km, 3, 9, mi, channel, at, miraflores, from, the, locks, to, the, gaillard, cut, skirting, miraflores, lake, each, of, these, channels, are, 218, m, 720, ft, wide, which, will, require, post, panamax, vessels, to, navigate, the, channels, in, one, direction, at, a, time, the, gaillard, cut, and, the, channel, through, gatun, lake, were, widened, to, at, least, 280, m, 920, ft, on, the, straight, portions, and, at, least, 366, m, 1, 200, ft, on, the, bends, the, maximum, level, of, gatun, lake, was, raised, from, 26, 7, to, 27, 1, m, 88, to, 89, ft, each, flight, of, locks, is, accompanied, by, nine, water, reuse, basins, three, per, lock, chamber, each, basin, being, about, 70, m, 230, ft, wide, 430, m, 1, 400, ft, long, and, 5, 50, m, 18, ft, deep, these, gravity, fed, basins, allow, 60, percent, of, the, water, used, in, each, transit, to, be, reused, the, new, locks, consequently, use, 7, percent, less, water, per, transit, than, each, of, the, existing, lock, lanes, the, deepening, of, gatun, lake, and, the, raising, of, its, maximum, water, level, also, provide, capacity, for, significantly, more, water, storage, these, measures, are, intended, to, allow, the, expanded, canal, to, operate, without, constructing, new, reservoirs, the, estimated, cost, of, the, project, is, us, 5, 25, billion, the, project, was, designed, to, allow, for, an, anticipated, growth, in, traffic, from, 280, million, pc, ums, tons, in, 2005, to, nearly, 510, million, pc, ums, tons, in, 2025, the, expanded, canal, will, have, a, maximum, sustainable, capacity, of, about, 600, million, pc, ums, tons, per, year, tolls, will, continue, to, be, calculated, based, on, vessel, tonnage, and, in, some, cases, depend, on, the, locks, used, an, article, in, the, february, 2007, issue, of, popular, mechanics, magazine, described, the, engineering, aspects, of, the, expansion, project, there, is, also, a, follow, up, article, in, the, february, 2010, issue, of, popular, mechanics, on, 3, september, 2007, thousands, of, panamanians, stood, across, from, para, so, hill, in, panama, to, witness, a, huge, initial, explosion, and, launch, of, the, expansion, program, the, first, phase, of, the, project, was, the, dry, excavations, of, the, 218, meters, 715, feet, wide, trench, connecting, the, gaillard, cut, with, the, pacific, coast, removing, 47, million, cubic, meters, of, earth, and, rock, by, june, 2012, a, 30, m, reinforced, concrete, monolith, had, been, completed, the, first, of, 46, such, monoliths, which, will, line, the, new, pacific, side, lock, walls, by, early, july, 2012, however, it, was, announced, that, the, canal, expansion, project, had, fallen, six, months, behind, schedule, leading, expectations, for, the, expansion, to, open, in, april, 2015, rather, than, october, 2014, as, originally, planned, by, september, 2014, the, new, gates, were, projected, to, be, open, for, transit, at, the, beginning, of, 2016, it, was, announced, in, july, 2009, that, the, belgian, dredging, company, jan, de, nul, together, with, a, consortium, of, contractors, consisting, of, the, spanish, sacyr, vallehermoso, the, italian, impregilo, and, the, panamanian, company, grupo, cusa, had, been, awarded, the, contract, to, build, the, six, new, locks, for, us, 3, 1, billion, which, was, one, billion, less, than, the, next, highest, competing, bid, due, to, having, a, concrete, budget, 71, percent, smaller, than, that, of, the, next, bidder, and, allotted, roughly, 25, percent, less, for, steel, to, reinforce, that, concrete, the, contract, resulted, in, 100, million, in, dredging, works, over, the, next, few, years, for, the, belgian, company, and, a, great, deal, of, work, for, its, construction, division, the, design, of, the, locks, is, a, carbon, copy, of, the, berendrecht, lock, which, is, 68, m, wide, and, 500, m, long, making, it, the, second, largest, lock, in, the, world, after, the, kieldrecht, lock, in, the, port, of, antwerp, belgium, completed, in, 1989, by, the, port, of, antwerp, which, de, nul, helped, build, the, company, still, has, engineers, and, specialists, who, were, part, of, that, project, in, january, 2014, a, contract, dispute, threatened, the, progress, of, the, project, there, was, a, delay, of, less, than, two, months, however, with, work, by, the, consortium, members, reaching, goals, by, june, 2014, in, june, 2015, flooding, of, the, new, locks, began, first, on, the, atlantic, side, then, on, the, pacific, by, then, the, canal, s, re, inauguration, was, slated, for, april, 2016, on, 23, march, 2016, the, expansion, inauguration, was, set, for, 26, june, 2016, the, new, locks, opened, for, commercial, traffic, on, 26, june, 2016, and, the, first, ship, to, cross, the, canal, using, the, third, set, of, locks, was, a, modern, neopanamax, vessel, the, chinese, owned, container, ship, cosco, shipping, panama, the, original, locks, now, over, 100, years, old, allow, engineers, greater, access, for, maintenance, and, are, projected, to, continue, operating, indefinitely, after, the, construction, of, the, new, locks, in, addition, to, the, already, existing, ones, to, date, the, ship, with, the, largest, dimensions, transiting, the, panama, canal, new, sideway, had, the, following, dimensions, 366, 47, meters, in, length, 48, 23, meters, in, width, and, 15, meters, draft, the, total, cost, is, unknown, since, the, expansion, s, contractors, are, seeking, at, least, an, additional, us, 3, 4, billion, from, the, canal, authority, due, to, excess, expenses, in, 1978, it, was, published, that, clearing, the, forest, in, the, watershed, might, kill, the, canal, in, 1985, the, forested, portion, had, dropped, to, 30, as, of, 2000, deforestation, through, growth, of, human, population, land, degradation, erosion, and, overhunting, continued, to, be, threats, to, the, ecosystem, of, the, panama, canal, watershed, deforestation, causes, erosion, raising, the, bottom, of, the, gatun, and, alajuala, lakes, lowering, their, water, holding, capacity, ship, traffic, routinely, contaminates, the, water, in, 1986, a, crude, oil, spill, east, of, the, caribbean, entrance, to, the, panama, canal, killed, plants, and, invertebrates, especially, with, the, 2016, expansion, invasive, species, can, travel, faster, either, on, the, hulls, of, ships, or, in, ballast, water, lake, water, has, become, salty, over, time, on, 7, july, 2014, wang, jing, chairman, of, the, hk, nicaragua, canal, development, investment, co, ltd, hknd, group, advised, that, a, route, for, nicaragua, s, proposed, canal, had, been, approved, the, construction, work, was, projected, by, hknd, to, begin, in, 2014, and, take, 5, years, although, there, had, been, little, progress, before, the, project, s, abandonment, the, nicaraguan, parliament, approved, plans, for, the, 280, km, 174, mi, canal, through, nicaragua, and, according, to, the, deal, the, company, would, have, been, responsible, for, operating, and, maintaining, the, canal, for, a, 50, year, period, by, may, 2017, no, concrete, action, had, been, reportedly, taken, constructing, the, canal, and, further, doubts, were, expressed, about, its, financing, in, february, 2018, analysts, widely, viewed, the, project, as, defunct, though, the, head, of, the, project, insisted, work, was, on, going, and, hknd, retained, the, legal, rights, to, the, concession, for, the, canal, as, well, as, side, projects, despite, hknd, vanishing, in, april, 2018, the, nicaraguan, government, indicates, that, it, will, continue, with, the, 908, km, 2, 351, sq, mi, dry, land, expropriations, within, nicaragua, under, land, expropriation, canal, law, 840, in, 2011, colombia, s, then, president, juan, manuel, santos, announced, a, proposal, for, a, 220, km, 137, mi, railway, between, colombia, s, pacific, and, caribbean, coasts, however, in, 2015, the, director, of, the, colombia, china, chamber, of, commerce, said, the, proposal, was, mentioned, in, 2011, and, subsequently, had, minimal, relevance, climate, change, has, thinned, much, of, the, ice, that, in, the, past, made, this, route, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, impassable, satellite, navigation, can, help, monitor, location, of, the, ice, which, remains, further, easing, transit, a, few, ships, have, successfully, crossed, the, previously, impossible, route, since, 2000, since, 2019, mexico, has, been, building, a, corridor, of, its, own, known, as, the, interoceanic, corridor, of, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, ciit, by, its, initials, in, spanish, which, will, use, primarily, a, railway, the, tren, interoce, nico, to, transport, cargo, and, passengers, from, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, atlantic, it, is, planned, to, open, on, 22, december, 2023, and, for, all, the, works, related, to, it, to, have, begun, operation, by, july, 2024, this, idea, is, older, than, the, panama, canal, itself, with, the, original, tehuantepec, railway, which, is, being, rehabilitated, for, the, ciit, being, inaugurated, in, 1907, to, initial, success, but, falling, out, of, use, due, to, the, mexican, revolution, and, the, opening, of, the, panama, canal, in, 1914, the, current, corridor, is, expected, to, have, certain, advantages, over, the, panama, canal, such, as, its, speed, being, able, to, transport, cargo, from, one, ocean, to, the, other, in, about, six, hours, and, its, location, being, closer, to, the, united, states, than, panama, in, addition, to, the, creation, of, ten, industrial, parks, in, the, isthmus, with, various, tax, benefits, to, encourage, private, investment, however, despite, being, often, described, as, a, potential, alternative, competitor, to, the, panama, canal, the, ambassador, of, panama, in, mexico, alfredo, oranges, and, the, former, director, of, the, ciit, rafael, mar, n, mollinedo, have, stated, that, they, do, not, see, the, ciit, in, this, way, and, that, they, prefer, to, see, it, as, a, complement, to, the, panama, canal, which, could, relieve, the, intense, traffic, the, canal, has, to, cope, with, the, ambassador, even, proposed, collaborating, with, the, mexican, government, to, make, the, corridor, more, efficient, individuals, companies, and, governments, have, explored, the, possibility, of, constructing, deep, water, ports, and, rail, links, connecting, coasts, as, a, dry, canal, in, guatemala, costa, rica, and, el, salvador, honduras, however, plans, to, construct, these, sea, rail, sea, links, have, yet, to, materialize, during, the, last, one, hundred, years, the, panama, canal, authority, has, granted, membership, in, the, esteemed, order, of, bearers, of, the, master, key, of, the, panama, canal, and, appointed, a, few, honorary, lead, pilots, to, employees, captains, and, dignitaries, one, of, the, most, recent, was, u, s, federal, maritime, commissioner, louis, sola, who, was, awarded, for, his, work, for, supporting, seafarers, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, previously, transiting, the, canal, more, than, 100, times, on, the, date, of, 25, april, 2006, was, awarded, the, title, of, panama, canal, honorary, pilot, the, senior, captain, raffaele, minotauro, an, unlimited, oceangoing, shipmaster, senior, grade, of, the, former, italian, governmental, navigation, company, known, as, the, italian, line, another, of, the, said, important, award, was, given, to, the, commodore, ronald, warwick, in, 2014, a, former, master, of, the, cunard, liners, queen, elizabeth, 2, and, rms, queen, mary, 2, who, has, traversed, the, canal,
