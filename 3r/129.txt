trans, boundary, river, of, asia, which, flows, through, india, and, bangladesh, the, 2, 525, km, 1, 569, mi, long, river, rises, in, the, western, himalayas, in, the, indian, state, of, uttarakhand, it, flows, south, and, east, through, the, gangetic, plain, of, north, india, receiving, the, right, bank, tributary, the, yamuna, which, also, rises, in, the, western, indian, himalayas, and, several, left, bank, tributaries, from, nepal, that, account, for, the, bulk, of, its, flow, in, west, bengal, state, india, a, feeder, canal, taking, off, from, its, right, bank, diverts, 50, of, its, flow, southwards, artificially, connecting, it, to, the, hooghly, river, the, ganges, continues, into, bangladesh, its, name, changing, to, the, padma, it, is, then, joined, by, the, jamuna, the, lower, stream, of, the, brahmaputra, and, eventually, the, meghna, forming, the, major, estuary, of, the, ganges, delta, and, emptying, into, the, bay, of, bengal, the, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, system, is, the, second, largest, river, on, earth, by, discharge, the, main, stem, of, the, ganges, begins, at, the, town, of, devprayag, at, the, confluence, of, the, alaknanda, which, is, the, source, stream, in, hydrology, on, account, of, its, greater, length, and, the, bhagirathi, which, is, considered, the, source, stream, in, hindu, mythology, the, ganges, is, a, lifeline, to, tens, of, millions, of, people, who, live, in, its, basin, and, depend, on, it, for, their, daily, needs, it, has, been, important, historically, with, many, former, provincial, or, imperial, capitals, such, as, pataliputra, kannauj, sonargaon, dhaka, bikrampur, kara, munger, kashi, patna, hajipur, kanpur, delhi, bhagalpur, murshidabad, baharampur, kampilya, and, kolkata, located, on, its, banks, or, those, of, its, tributaries, and, connected, waterways, the, river, is, home, to, approximately, 140, species, of, fish, 90, species, of, amphibians, and, also, reptiles, and, mammals, including, critically, endangered, species, such, as, the, gharial, and, south, asian, river, dolphin, the, ganges, is, the, most, sacred, river, to, hindus, it, is, worshipped, as, the, goddess, ganga, in, hinduism, the, ganges, is, threatened, by, severe, pollution, this, not, only, poses, a, danger, to, humans, but, also, to, many, species, of, animals, the, levels, of, fecal, coliform, bacteria, from, human, waste, in, the, river, near, varanasi, are, more, than, 100, times, the, indian, government, s, official, limit, the, ganga, action, plan, an, environmental, initiative, to, clean, up, the, river, has, been, considered, a, failure, which, is, variously, attributed, to, corruption, a, lack, of, will, in, the, government, poor, technical, expertise, poor, environmental, planning, and, a, lack, of, support, from, religious, authorities, the, upper, phase, of, the, river, ganges, begins, at, the, confluence, of, the, bhagirathi, and, alaknanda, rivers, in, the, town, of, devprayag, in, the, garhwal, division, of, the, indian, state, of, uttarakhand, the, bhagirathi, is, considered, to, be, the, source, in, hindu, culture, and, mythology, although, the, alaknanda, is, longer, and, therefore, hydrologically, the, source, stream, the, headwaters, of, the, alakananda, are, formed, by, snow, melt, from, peaks, such, as, nanda, devi, trisul, and, kamet, the, bhagirathi, rises, at, the, foot, of, gangotri, glacier, at, gomukh, at, an, elevation, of, 4, 356, m, 14, 291, ft, and, was, mythologically, referred, to, as, residing, in, the, matted, locks, of, shiva, symbolically,

river, son, river, punpun, and, damodar, the, hydrology, of, the, ganges, river, is, very, complicated, especially, in, the, ganges, delta, region, one, result, is, different, ways, to, determine, the, river, s, length, its, discharge, and, the, size, of, its, drainage, basin, the, name, ganges, is, used, for, the, river, between, the, confluence, of, the, bhagirathi, and, alaknanda, rivers, in, the, himalayas, and, the, first, bifurcation, of, the, river, near, the, farakka, barrage, and, the, india, bangladesh, border, the, length, of, the, ganges, is, frequently, said, to, be,

the, source, of, the, bhagirathi, river, gangotri, glacier, at, gomukh, and, its, mouth, being, the, mouth, of, the, meghna, river, on, the, bay, of, bengal, sometimes, the, source, of, the, ganges, is, considered, to, be, at, haridwar, where, its, himalayan, headwater, streams, debouch, onto, the, gangetic, plain, in, some, cases, the, length, of, the, ganges, is, given, by, its, hooghly, river, distributary, which, is, longer, than, its, main, outlet, via, the, meghna, river, resulting, in, a, total, length, of, about, 2, 704, km, 1, 680, mi, if, taken, from, the, source, of, the, bhagirathi, or, 2, 321, 50, km, 1, 442, 51, mi, if, from, haridwar, to, the, hooghly, s, mouth, in, other, cases, the, length, is, said, to, be, about, 2, 304, km, 1, 432, mi, from, the, source, of, the, bhagirathi, to, the, bangladesh, border, where, its, name, changes, to, padma, for, similar, reasons, sources, differ, over, the, size, of, the, river, s, drainage, basin, the, basin, covers, parts, of, four, countries, india, nepal, china, and, bangladesh, eleven, indian, states, himachal, pradesh, uttarakhand, uttar, pradesh, madhya, pradesh, chhattisgarh, bihar, jharkhand, punjab, haryana, rajasthan, west, bengal, and, the, union, territory, of, delhi, the, ganges, basin, including, the, delta, but, not, the, brahmaputra, or, meghna, basins, is, about, 1, 080, 000, km, 2, 420, 000, sq, mi, of, which, 861, 000, km, 2, 332, 000, sq, mi, is, in, india, about, 80, 140, 000, km, 2, 54, 000, sq, mi, in, nepal, 13, 46, 000, km, 2, 18, 000, sq, mi, in, bangladesh, 4, and, 33, 000, km, 2, 13, 000, sq, mi, in, china, 3, sometimes, the, ganges, and, brahmaputra, meghna, drainage, basins, are, combined, for, a, total, of, about, 1, 600, 000, km, 2, 620, 000, sq, mi, or, 1, 621, 000, km, 2, 626, 000, sq, mi, the, combined, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, basin, abbreviated, gbm, or, gmb, drainage, basin, is, spread, across, bangladesh, bhutan, india, nepal, and, china, the, ganges, basin, ranges, from, the, himalaya, and, the, transhimalaya, in, the, north, to, the, northern, slopes, of, the, vindhya, range, in, the, south, from, the, eastern, slopes, of, the, aravalli, in, the, west, to, the, chota, nagpur, plateau, and, the, sunderbans, delta, in, the, east, a, significant, portion, of, the, discharge, from, the, ganges, comes, from, the, himalayan, mountain, system, within, the, himalaya, the, ganges, basin, spreads, almost, 1, 200, km, from, the, yamuna, satluj, divide, along, the, simla, ridge, forming, the, boundary, with, the, indus, basin, in, the, west, to, the, singalila, ridge, along, the, nepal, sikkim, border, forming, the, boundary, with, the, brahmaputra, basin, in, the, east, this, section, of, the, himalaya, contains, 9, of, the, 14, highest, peaks, in, the, world, over, 8, 000m, in, height, including, mount, everest, which, is, the, high, point, of, the, ganges, basin, the, other, peaks, over, 8, 000m, in, the, basin, are, kangchenjunga, lhotse, makalu, cho, oyu, dhaulagiri, manaslu, annapurna, and, shishapangma, the, himalayan, portion, of, the, basin, includes, the, south, eastern, portion, of, the, state, of, himachal, pradesh, the, entire, state, of, uttarakhand, the, entire, country, of, nepal, and, the, extreme, north, western, portion, of, the, state, of, west, bengal, the, discharge, of, the, ganges, also, differs, by, source, frequently, discharge, is, described, for, the, mouth, of, the, meghna, river, thus, combining, the, ganges, with, the, brahmaputra, and, meghna, this, results, in, a, total, average, annual, discharge, of, about, 38, 000, m, 3, s, 1, 300, 000, cu, ft, s, or, 42, 470, m, 3, s, 1, 500, 000, cu, ft, s, in, other, cases, the, average, annual, discharges, of, the, ganges, brahmaputra, and, meghna, are, given, separately, at, about, 16, 650, m, 3, s, 588, 000, cu, ft, s, for, the, ganges, about, 19, 820, m, 3, s, 700, 000, cu, ft, s, for, the, brahmaputra, and, about, 5, 100, m, 3, s, 180, 000, cu, ft, s, for, the, meghna, the, maximum, peak, discharge, of, the, ganges, as, recorded, at, hardinge, bridge, in, bangladesh, exceeded, 70, 000, m, 3, s, 2, 500, 000, cu, ft, s, the, minimum, recorded, at, the, same, place, was, about, 180, m, 3, s, 6, 400, cu, ft, s, in, 1997, the, hydrologic, cycle, in, the, ganges, basin, is, governed, by, the, southwest, monsoon, about, 84, of, the, total, rainfall, occurs, in, the, monsoon, from, june, to, september, consequently, streamflow, in, the, ganges, is, highly, seasonal, the, average, dry, season, to, monsoon, discharge, ratio, is, about, 1, 6, as, measured, at, hardinge, bridge, this, strong, seasonal, variation, underlies, many, problems, of, land, and, water, resource, development, in, the, region, the, seasonality, of, flow, is, so, acute, it, can, cause, both, drought, and, floods, bangladesh, in, particular, frequently, experiences, drought, during, the, dry, season, and, regularly, suffers, extreme, floods, during, the, monsoon, in, the, ganges, delta, many, large, rivers, come, together, both, merging, and, bifurcating, in, a, complicated, network, of, channels, the, two, largest, rivers, the, ganges, and, brahmaputra, both, split, into, distributary, channels, the, largest, of, which, merge, with, other, large, rivers, before, themselves, joining, the, bay, of, bengal, but, this, current, channel, pattern, was, not, always, the, case, over, time, the, rivers, in, ganges, delta, have, often, changed, course, sometimes, altering, the, network, of, channels, in, significant, ways, before, the, late, 12th, century, the, bhagirathi, hooghly, distributary, was, the, main, channel, of, the, ganges, and, the, padma, was, only, a, minor, spill, channel, the, main, flow, of, the, river, reached, the, sea, not, via, the, modern, hooghly, river, but, rather, by, the, adi, ganga, between, the, 12th, and, 16th, centuries, the, bhagirathi, hooghly, and, padma, channels, were, more, or, less, equally, significant, after, the, 16th, century, the, padma, grew, to, become, the, main, channel, of, the, ganges, it, is, thought, that, the, bhagirathi, hooghly, became, increasingly, choked, with, silt, causing, the, main, flow, of, the, ganges, to, shift, to, the, southeast, and, the, padma, river, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, padma, had, become, the, main, distributary, of, the, ganges, one, result, of, this, shift, to, the, padma, was, that, the, ganges, now, joined, the, meghna, and, brahmaputra, rivers, before, emptying, into, the, bay, of, bengal, the, present, confluence, of, the, ganges, and, meghna, was, formed, very, recently, about, 150, years, ago, also, near, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, course, of, the, lower, brahmaputra, changed, dramatically, significantly, altering, its, relationship, with, the, ganges, in, 1787, there, was, a, great, flood, on, the, teesta, river, which, at, the, time, was, a, tributary, of, the, ganges, padma, river, the, flood, of, 1787, caused, the, teesta, to, undergo, a, sudden, change, course, an, avulsion, shifting, east, to, join, the, brahmaputra, and, causing, the, brahmaputra, to, shift, its, course, south, cutting, a, new, channel, this, new, main, channel, of, the, brahmaputra, is, called, the, jamuna, river, it, flows, south, to, join, the, ganges, padma, during, ancient, times, the, main, flow, of, the, brahmaputra, was, more, easterly, passing, by, the, city, of, mymensingh, and, joining, the, meghna, river, today, this, channel, is, a, small, distributary, but, retains, the, name, brahmaputra, sometimes, old, brahmaputra, the, site, of, the, old, brahmaputra, meghna, confluence, in, the, locality, of, langalbandh, is, still, considered, sacred, by, hindus, near, the, confluence, is, a, major, early, historic, site, called, wari, bateshwar, in, the, rainy, season, of, 1809, the, lower, channel, of, the, bhagirathi, leading, to, kolkata, had, been, entirely, shut, but, in, the, following, year, it, opened, again, and, was, nearly, of, the, same, size, as, the, upper, channel, but, both, however, suffered, a, considerable, diminution, owing, probably, to, the, new, communication, opened, below, the, jalanggi, on, the, upper, channel, discharge, of, the, ganges, river, at, farakka, barrage, period, from, 1998, 01, 01, to, 2023, 12, 31, the, first, european, traveller, to, mention, the, ganges, was, the, greek, envoy, megasthenes, ca, 350, 290, bce, he, did, so, several, times, in, his, work, indica, india, again, possesses, many, rivers, both, large, and, navigable, which, having, their, sources, in, the, mountains, which, stretch, along, the, northern, frontier, traverse, the, level, country, and, not, a, few, of, these, after, uniting, with, each, other, fall, into, the, river, called, the, ganges, now, this, river, which, at, its, source, is, 30, stadia, broad, flows, from, north, to, south, and, empties, its, waters, into, the, ocean, forming, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, gangaridai, a, nation, which, possesses, a, vast, force, of, the, largest, sized, elephants, diodorus, ii, 37, in, 1951, a, water, sharing, dispute, arose, between, india, and, east, pakistan, now, bangladesh, after, india, declared, its, intention, to, build, the, farakka, barrage, the, original, purpose, of, the, barrage, which, was, completed, in, 1975, was, to, divert, up, to, 1, 100, m, 3, s, 39, 000, cu, ft, s, of, water, from, the, ganges, to, the, bhagirathi, hooghly, distributary, to, restore, navigability, at, the, port, of, kolkata, it, was, assumed, that, during, the, worst, dry, season, the, ganges, flow, would, be, around, 1, 400, to, 1, 600, m, 3, s, 49, 000, to, 57, 000, cu, ft, s, thus, leaving, 280, to, 420, m, 3, s, 9, 900, to, 14, 800, cu, ft, s, for, the, then, east, pakistan, east, pakistan, objected, and, a, protracted, dispute, ensued, in, 1996, a, 30, year, treaty, was, signed, with, bangladesh, the, terms, of, the, agreement, are, complicated, but, in, essence, they, state, that, if, the, ganges, flow, at, farakka, was, less, than, 2, 000, m, 3, s, 71, 000, cu, ft, s, then, india, and, bangladesh, would, each, receive, 50, of, the, water, with, each, receiving, at, least, 1, 000, m, 3, s, 35, 000, cu, ft, s, for, alternating, ten, day, periods, however, within, a, year, the, flow, at, farakka, fell, to, levels, far, below, the, historic, average, making, it, impossible, to, implement, the, guaranteed, sharing, of, water, in, march, 1997, flow, of, the, ganges, in, bangladesh, dropped, to, its, lowest, ever, 180, m, 3, s, 6, 400, cu, ft, s, dry, season, flows, returned, to, normal, levels, in, the, years, following, but, efforts, were, made, to, address, the, problem, one, plan, is, for, another, barrage, to, be, built, in, bangladesh, at, pangsha, west, of, dhaka, this, barrage, would, help, bangladesh, better, utilize, its, share, of, the, waters, of, the, ganges, the, ganges, is, a, sacred, river, to, hindus, along, every, fragment, of, its, length, all, along, its, course, hindus, bathe, in, its, waters, paying, homage, to, their, ancestors, and, their, gods, by, cupping, the, water, in, their, hands, lifting, it, and, letting, it, fall, back, into, the, river, they, offer, flowers, and, rose, petals, and, float, shallow, clay, dishes, filled, with, oil, and, lit, with, wicks, diyas, on, the, journey, back, home, from, the, ganges, they, carry, small, quantities, of, river, water, with, them, for, use, in, rituals, ganga, jal, literally, the, water, of, the, ganges, the, ganges, is, the, embodiment, of, all, sacred, waters, in, hindu, mythology, local, rivers, are, said, to, be, like, the, ganges, and, are, sometimes, called, the, local, ganges, the, godavari, river, of, maharashtra, in, western, india, is, called, the, ganges, of, the, south, or, the, dakshin, ganga, the, godavari, is, the, ganges, that, was, led, by, the, sage, gautama, to, flow, through, central, india, the, ganges, is, invoked, whenever, water, is, used, in, hindu, ritual, and, is, therefore, present, in, all, sacred, waters, despite, this, nothing, is, more, stirring, for, a, hindu, than, a, dip, in, the, actual, river, which, is, thought, to, remit, sins, especially, at, one, of, the, famous, tirthas, such, as, varanasi, gangotri, haridwar, or, the, triveni, sangam, at, prayagraj, the, symbolic, and, religious, importance, of, the, ganges, is, one, of, the, few, things, that, hindus, even, their, skeptics, have, agreed, upon, jawaharlal, nehru, a, religious, iconoclast, himself, asked, for, a, handful, of, his, ashes, to, be, thrown, into, the, ganges, the, ganga, he, wrote, in, his, will, is, the, river, of, india,

lifetimes, of, sins, those, who, cannot, journey, to, the, river, however, can, achieve, the, same, results, by, bathing, in, any, nearby, body, of, water, which, for, the, true, believer, takes, on, all, the, attributes, of, the, ganges, the, karunasiri, is, an, old, theme, in, hinduism, with, a, number, of, different, versions, of, the, story, in, the, vedic, version, indra, the, lord, of, swarga, heaven, slays, the, celestial, serpent, vritra, releasing, the, celestial, liquid, soma, or, the, nectar, of, the, gods, which, then, plunges, to, the, earth, and, waters, it, with, sustenance, in, the, vaishnava, version, of, the, myth, the, heavenly, waters, were, then, a, river, called, vishnupadi, sanskrit, from, the, foot, of, vishnu, as, lord, vishnu, as, the, avatar, vamana, completes, his, celebrated, three, strides, of, earth, sky, and, heaven, he, stubs, his, toe, on, the, vault, of, heaven, punches, open, a, hole, and, releases, the, vishnupadi, which, until, now, had, been, circling, the, cosmic, egg, flowing, out, of, the, vault, she, plummets, down, to, indra, s, heaven, where, she, is, received, by, dhruva, once, a, steadfast, worshipper, of, vishnu, now, fixed, in, the, sky, as, the, pole, star, next, she, streams, across, the, sky, forming, the, milky, way, and, arrives, on, the, moon, she, then, flows, down, earthwards, to, brahma, s, realm, a, divine, lotus, atop, mount, meru, whose, petals, form, the, earthly, continents, there, the, divine, waters, break, up, with, one, stream, the, bhagirathi, flowing, down, one, petal, into, bharatvarsha, india, as, the, ganges, it, is, shiva, however, among, the, major, deities, of, the, hindu, pantheon, who, appears, in, the, most, widely, known, version, of, the, avatarana, story, told, and, retold, in, the, ramayana, the, mahabharata, and, several, puranas, the, story, begins, with, a, sage, kapila, whose, intense, meditation, has, been, disturbed, by, the, sixty, thousand, sons, of, king, sagara, livid, at, being, disturbed, kapila, sears, them, with, his, angry, gaze, reduces, them, to, ashes, and, dispatches, them, to, the, netherworld, only, the, waters, of, the, ganges, then, in, heaven, can, bring, the, dead, sons, their, salvation, a, descendant, of, these, sons, king, bhagiratha, anxious, to, restore, his, ancestors, undertakes, rigorous, penance, and, is, eventually, granted, the, prize, of, ganges, s, descent, from, heaven, however, since, her, turbulent, force, would, also, shatter, the, earth, bhagiratha, persuades, shiva, in, his, abode, on, mount, kailash, to, receive, the, ganges, in, the, coils, of, his, tangled, hair, and, break, her, fall, the, ganges, descends, is, tamed, in, shiva, s, locks, and, arrives, in, the, himalayas, she, is, then, led, by, the, waiting, bhagiratha, down, into, the, plains, at, haridwar, across, the, plains, first, to, the, confluence, with, the, yamuna, at, prayag, and, then, to, varanasi, and, eventually, to, ganges, sagar, ganges, delta, where, she, meets, the, ocean, sinks, to, the, netherworld, and, saves, the, sons, of, sagara, in, honour, of, bhagirath, s, pivotal, role, in, the, avatarana, the, source, stream, of, the, ganges, in, the, himalayas, is, named, bhagirathi, sanskrit, of, bhagiratha, as, the, ganges, had, descended, from, heaven, to, earth, in, the, hindu, tradition, she, is, also, considered, the, vehicle, of, ascent, from, earth, to, heaven, as, the, triloka, patha, gamini, sanskrit, triloka, three, worlds, patha, road, gamini, one, who, travels, of, the, tradition, she, flows, in, heaven, earth, and, the, netherworld, and, consequently, is, a, tirtha, or, crossing, point, of, all, beings, the, living, as, well, as, the, dead, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, story, of, the, avatarana, is, told, at, shraddha, ceremonies, for, the, deceased, in, hinduism, and, ganges, water, is, used, in, vedic, rituals, after, death, among, all, hymns, devoted, to, the, ganges, there, are, none, more, popular, than, the, ones, expressing, the, worshipper, s, wish, to, breathe, his, last, surrounded, by, her, waters, the, gangashtakam, expresses, this, longing, fervently, o, mother, necklace, adorning, the, worlds, banner, rising, to, heaven, i, ask, that, i, may, leave, of, this, body, on, your, banks, drinking, your, water, rolling, in, your, waves, remembering, your, name, bestowing, my, gaze, upon, you, no, place, along, her, banks, is, more, longed, for, at, the, moment, of, death, by, hindus, than, varanasi, the, great, cremation, ground, or, mahashmshana, those, who, are, lucky, enough, to, die, in, varanasi, are, cremated, on, the, banks, of, the, ganges, and, are, granted, instant, salvation, if, the, death, has, occurred, elsewhere, salvation, can, be, achieved, by, immersing, the, ashes, in, the, ganges, if, the, ashes, have, been, immersed, in, another, body, of, water, a, relative, can, still, gain, salvation, for, the, deceased, by, journeying, to, the, ganges, if, possible, during, the, lunar, fortnight, of, the, ancestors, in, the, hindu, calendar, month, of, ashwin, september, or, october, and, performing, the, shraddha, rites, hindus, also, perform, pinda, pradana, a, rite, for, the, dead, in, which, balls, of, rice, and, sesame, seed, are, offered, to, the, ganges, while, the, names, of, the, deceased, relatives, are, recited, every, sesame, seed, in, every, ball, thus, offered, according, to, one, story, assures, a, thousand, years, of, heavenly, salvation, for, each, relative, indeed, the, ganges, is, so, important, in, the, rituals, after, death, that, the, mahabharata, in, one, of, its, popular, lokas, says, if, only, one, bone, of, a, deceased, person, should, touch, the, water, of, the, ganges, that, person, shall, dwell, honoured, in, heaven, as, if, to, illustrate, this, truism, the, kashi, khanda, varanasi, chapter, of, the, skanda, purana, recounts, the, remarkable, story, of, vahika, a, profligate, and, unrepentant, sinner, who, is, killed, by, a, tiger, in, the, forest, his, soul, arrives, before, yama, the, lord, of, death, to, be, judged, for, the, afterworld, having, no, compensating, virtue, vahika, s, soul, is, at, once, dispatched, to, hell, while, this, is, happening, his, body, on, earth, however, is, being, picked, at, by, vultures, one, of, whom, flies, away, with, a, foot, bone, another, bird, comes, after, the, vulture, and, in, fighting, him, off, the, vulture, accidentally, drops, the, bone, into, the, ganges, below, blessed, by, this, event, vahika, on, his, way, to, hell, is, rescued, by, a, celestial, chariot, which, takes, him, instead, to, heaven, hindus, consider, the, waters, of, the, ganges, to, be, both, pure, and, purifying, regardless, of, all, scientific, understanding, of, its, waters, the, ganges, is, always, ritually, and, symbolically, pure, in, hindu, culture, nothing, reclaims, order, from, disorder, more, than, the, waters, of, the, ganga, moving, water, as, in, a, river, is, considered, purifying, in, hindu, culture, because, it, is, thought, to, both, absorb, impurities, and, take, them, away, the, swiftly, moving, ganga, especially, in, its, upper, reaches, where, a, bather, has, to, grasp, an, anchored, chain, to, not, be, carried, away, is, especially, purifying, what, the, ganges, removes, however, is, not, necessarily, physical, dirt, but, symbolic, dirt, it, wipes, away, the, sins, of, the, bather, not, just, of, the, present, but, of, a, lifetime, a, popular, paean, to, the, ganga, is, the, ganga, lahiri, composed, by, a, 17th, century, poet, jagannatha, who, legend, has, it, was, turned, out, of, his, hindu, brahmin, caste, for, carrying, on, an, affair, with, a, muslim, woman, having, attempted, futilely, to, be, rehabilitated, within, the, hindu, fold, the, poet, finally, appeals, to, ganga, the, hope, of, the, hopeless, and, the, comforter, of, last, resort, along, with, his, beloved, jagannatha, sits, at, the, top, of, the, flight, of, steps, leading, to, the, water, at, the, famous, panchganga, ghat, in, varanasi, as, he, recites, each, verse, of, the, poem, the, water, of, the, ganges, rises, one, step, until, in, the, end, it, envelops, the, lovers, and, carries, them, away, i, come, to, you, as, a, child, to, his, mother, begins, the, ganga, lahiri, i, come, as, an, orphan, to, you, moist, with, love, i, come, without, refuge, to, you, giver, of, sacred, rest, i, come, a, fallen, man, to, you, uplifter, of, all, i, come, undone, by, disease, to, you, the, perfect, physician, i, come, my, heart, dry, with, thirst, to, you, ocean, of, sweet, wine, do, with, me, whatever, you, will, ganga, is, a, consort, to, all, three, major, male, deities, of, hinduism, as, brahma, s, partner, she, always, travels, with, him, in, the, form, of, water, in, his, kamandalu, water, pot, she, is, also, vishnu, s, consort, not, only, does, she, emanate, from, his, foot, as, vishnupadi, in, the, avatarana, story, but, is, also, with, sarasvati, and, lakshmi, one, of, his, co, wives, in, one, popular, story, envious, of, being, outdone, by, each, other, the, co, wives, begin, to, quarrel, while, lakshmi, attempts, to, mediate, the, quarrel, ganga, and, sarasvati, heap, misfortune, on, each, other, they, curse, each, other, to, become, rivers, and, to, carry, within, them, by, washing, the, sins, of, their, human, worshippers, soon, their, husband, vishnu, arrives, and, decides, to, calm, the, situation, by, separating, the, goddesses, he, orders, sarasvati, to, marry, brahma, ganga, to, marry, shiva, and, lakshmi, as, the, blameless, conciliator, to, remain, as, his, own, wife, ganga, and, sarasvati, however, are, so, distraught, at, this, dispensation, and, wail, so, loudly, that, vishnu, is, forced, to, take, back, his, words, consequently, in, their, lives, as, rivers, they, are, still, thought, to, be, with, him, it, is, shiva, s, relationship, with, ganga, that, is, the, best, known, in, ganges, mythology, her, descent, the, avatarana, is, not, a, one, time, event, but, a, continuously, occurring, one, in, which, she, is, forever, falling, from, heaven, into, his, locks, and, being, forever, tamed, shiva, is, depicted, in, hindu, iconography, as, gangadhara, the, bearer, of, the, ganga, with, ganga, shown, as, spout, of, water, rising, from, his, hair, the, shiva, ganga, relationship, is, both, perpetual, and, intimate, shiva, is, sometimes, called, uma, ganga, patiswara, husband, and, lord, of, uma, parvati, and, ganga, and, ganga, often, arouses, the, jealousy, of, shiva, s, better, known, consort, ganga, is, the, shakti, or, the, moving, restless, rolling, energy, in, the, form, of, which, the, otherwise, reclusive, and, unapproachable, shiva, appears, on, earth, as, water, this, moving, energy, can, be, felt, tasted, and, absorbed, the, war, god, skanda, addresses, the, sage, agastya, in, the, kashi, khand, of, the, skanda, purana, in, these, words, one, should, not, be, amazed, that, this, ganges, is, really, power, for, is, she, not, the, supreme, shakti, of, the, eternal, shiva, taken, in, the, form, of, water, this, ganges, filled, with, the, sweet, wine, of, compassion, was, sent, out, for, the, salvation, of, the, world, by, shiva, the, lord, of, the, lords, good, people, should, not, think, this, triple, pathed, river, to, be, like, the, thousand, other, earthly, rivers, filled, with, water, the, ganga, is, also, the, mother, the, ganga, mata, mata, mother, of, hindu, worship, and, culture, accepting, all, and, forgiving, all, unlike, other, goddesses, she, has, no, destructive, or, fearsome, aspect, destructive, though, she, might, be, as, a, river, in, nature, she, is, also, a, mother, to, other, gods, she, accepts, shiva, s, incandescent, seed, from, the, fire, god, agni, which, is, too, hot, for, this, world, and, cools, it, in, her, waters, this, union, produces, skanda, or, kartikeya, the, god, of, war, in, the, mahabharata, she, is, married, to, shantanu, and, the, mother, of, heroic, warrior, patriarch, bhishma, when, bhishma, is, mortally, wounded, in, battle, ganga, comes, out, of, the, water, in, human, form, and, weeps, uncontrollably, over, his, body, the, ganges, is, the, distilled, lifeblood, of, the, hindu, tradition, of, its, divinities, holy, books, and, enlightenment, as, such, her, worship, does, not, require, the, usual, rites, of, invocation, avahana, at, the, beginning, and, dismissal, visarjana, at, the, end, required, in, the, worship, of, other, gods, her, divinity, is, immediate, and, everlasting, early, in, ancient, indian, culture, the, river, ganges, was, associated, with, fecundity, its, redeeming, waters, and, its, rich, silt, providing, sustenance, to, all, who, lived, along, its, banks, a, counterpoise, to, the, dazzling, heat, of, the, indian, summer, the, ganges, came, to, be, imbued, with, magical, qualities, and, to, be, revered, in, anthropomorphic, form, by, the, 5th, century, ce, an, elaborate, mythology, surrounded, the, ganges, now, a, goddess, in, her, own, right, and, a, symbol, for, all, rivers, of, india, hindu, temples, all, over, india, had, statues, and, reliefs, of, the, goddess, carved, at, their, entrances, symbolically, washing, the, sins, of, arriving, worshippers, and, guarding, the, gods, within, as, protector, of, the, sanctum, sanctorum, the, goddess, soon, came, to, be, depicted, with, several, characteristic, accessories, the, makara, a, crocodile, like, undersea, monster, often, shown, with, an, elephant, like, trunk, the, kumbha, an, overfull, vase, various, overhead, parasol, like, coverings, and, a, gradually, increasing, retinue, of, humans, central, to, the, goddess, s, visual, identification, is, the, makara, which, is, also, her, vahana, or, mount, an, ancient, symbol, in, india, it, pre, dates, all, appearances, of, the, goddess, ganga, in, art, the, makara, has, a, dual, symbolism, on, the, one, hand, it, represents, the, life, affirming, waters, and, plants, of, its, environment, on, the, other, it, represents, fear, both, fear, of, the, unknown, which, it, elicits, by, lurking, in, those, waters, and, real, fear, which, it, instils, by, appearing, in, sight, the, earliest, extant, unambiguous, pairing, of, the, makara, with, ganga, is, at, the, udayagiri, caves, in, central, india, circa, 400, ce, here, in, the, cave, v, flanking, the, main, figure, of, vishnu, shown, in, his, boar, incarnation, two, river, goddesses, ganga, and, yamuna, appear, atop, their, respective, mounts, makara, and, kurma, a, turtle, or, tortoise, the, makara, is, often, accompanied, by, a, gana, a, small, boy, or, child, near, its, mouth, as, for, example, shown, in, the, gupta, period, relief, from, besnagar, central, india, in, the, left, most, frame, above, the, gana, represents, both, posterity, and, development, udbhava, the, pairing, of, the, fearsome, life, destroying, makara, with, the, youthful, life, affirming, gana, speaks, to, two, aspects, of, the, ganges, herself, although, she, has, provided, sustenance, to, millions, she, has, also, brought, hardship, injury, and, death, by, causing, major, floods, along, her, banks, the, goddess, ganga, is, also, accompanied, by, a, dwarf, attendant, who, carries, a, cosmetic, bag, and, on, whom, she, sometimes, leans, as, if, for, support, see, for, example, frames, 1, 2, and, 4, above, the, purna, kumbha, or, full, pot, of, water, is, the, second, most, discernible, element, of, the, ganga, iconography, appearing, first, also, in, the, relief, in, the, udayagiri, caves, 5th, century, it, gradually, appeared, more, frequently, as, the, theme, of, the, goddess, matured, by, the, 7th, century, it, had, become, an, established, feature, as, seen, for, example, in, the, dashavatara, temple, deogarh, uttar, pradesh, 7th, century, the, trimurti, temple, badoli, chittorgarh, rajasthan, and, at, the, lakshmaneshwar, temple, kharod, bilaspur, chhattisgarh, 9th, or, 10th, century, and, seen, very, clearly, in, frame, 3, above, and, less, clearly, in, the, remaining, frames, worshipped, even, today, the, full, pot, is, emblematic, of, the, formless, brahman, as, well, as, of, woman, of, the, womb, and, of, birth, furthermore, the, river, goddesses, ganga, and, saraswati, were, both, born, from, brahma, s, pot, containing, the, celestial, waters, in, her, earliest, depictions, at, temple, entrances, the, goddess, ganga, appeared, standing, beneath, the, overhanging, branch, of, a, tree, as, seen, as, well, in, the, udayagiri, caves, however, soon, the, tree, cover, had, evolved, into, a, chatra, or, parasol, held, by, an, attendant, for, example, in, the, 7th, century, dasavatara, temple, at, deogarh, the, parasol, can, be, clearly, seen, in, frame, 3, above, its, stem, can, be, seen, in, frame, 4, but, the, rest, has, broken, off, the, cover, undergoes, another, transformation, in, the, temple, at, kharod, bilaspur, 9th, or, 10th, century, where, the, parasol, is, lotus, shaped, and, yet, another, at, the, trimurti, temple, at, badoli, where, the, parasol, has, been, replaced, entirely, by, a, lotus, as, the, iconography, evolved, sculptors, especially, in, central, india, were, producing, animated, scenes, of, the, goddess, replete, with, an, entourage, and, suggestive, of, a, queen, en, route, to, a, river, to, bathe, a, relief, similar, to, the, depiction, in, frame, 4, above, is, described, in, pal, 1997, p, 43, as, follows, a, typical, relief, of, about, the, ninth, century, that, once, stood, at, the, entrance, of, a, temple, the, river, goddess, ganga, is, shown, as, a, voluptuously, endowed, lady, with, a, retinue, following, the, iconographic, prescription, she, stands, gracefully, on, her, composite, makara, mount, and, holds, a, water, pot, the, dwarf, attendant, carries, her, cosmetic, bag, and, a, female, holds, the, stem, of, a, giant, lotus, leaf, that, serves, as, her, mistress, s, parasol, the, fourth, figure, is, a, male, guardian, often, in, such, reliefs, the, makara, s, tail, is, extended, with, great, flourish, into, a, scrolling, design, symbolizing, both, vegetation, and, water, kumbh, mela, is, a, mass, hindu, pilgrimage, in, which,

tributaries, especially, the, yamuna, have, been, used, for, irrigation, since, ancient, times, dams, and, canals, were, common, in, the, gangetic, plain, by, the, 4th, century, bce, the, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, basin, has, a, huge, hydroelectric, potential, on, the, order, of, 200, 000, to, 250, 000, megawatts, nearly, half, of, which, could, easily, be, harnessed, as, of, 1999, india, tapped, about, 12, of, the, hydroelectric, potential, of, the, ganges, and, just, 1, of, the, vast, potential, of, the, brahmaputra, megasthenes, a, greek, ethnographer, who, visited, india, during, the, 3rd, century, bce, when, mauryans, ruled, india, described, the, existence, of, canals, in, the, gangetic, plain, kautilya, also, known, as, chanakya, an, advisor, to, chandragupta, maurya, the, founder, of, maurya, empire, included, the, destruction, of, dams, and, levees, as, a, strategy, during, the, war, firuz, shah, tughlaq, had, many, canals, built, the, longest, of, which, 240, km, 150, mi, was, built, in, 1356, on, the, yamuna, river, now, known, as, the, western, yamuna, canal, it, has, fallen, into, disrepair, and, been, restored, several, times, the, mughal, emperor, shah, jahan, built, an, irrigation, canal, on, the, yamuna, river, in, the, early, 17th, century, it, fell, into, disuse, until, 1830, when, it, was, reopened, as, the, eastern, yamuna, canal, under, british, control, the, reopened, canal, became, a, model, for, the, upper, ganges, canal, and, all, following, canal, projects, the, first, british, canal, in, india, which, did, not, have, indian, antecedents, was, the, ganges, canal, built, between, 1842, and, 1854, contemplated, first, by, col, john, russell, colvin, in, 1836, it, did, not, at, first, elicit, much, enthusiasm, from, its, eventual, architect, sir, proby, thomas, cautley, who, balked, at, the, idea, of, cutting, a, canal, through, extensive, low, lying, land, to, reach, the, drier, upland, destination, however, after, the, agra, famine, of, 1837, 38, during, which, the, east, india, company, s, administration, spent, rs, 2, 300, 000, on, famine, relief, the, idea, of, a, canal, became, more, attractive, to, the, company, s, budget, conscious, court, of, directors, in, 1839, the, governor, general, of, india, lord, auckland, with, the, court, s, assent, granted, funds, to, cautley, for, a, full, survey, of, the, swath, of, land, that, underlay, and, fringed, the, projected, course, of, the, canal, the, court, of, directors, moreover, considerably, enlarged, the, scope, of, the, projected, canal, which, in, consequence, of, the, severity, and, geographical, extent, of, the, famine, they, now, deemed, to, be, the, entire, doab, region, the, enthusiasm, however, proved, to, be, short, lived, auckland, s, successor, as, governor, general, lord, ellenborough, appeared, less, receptive, to, large, scale, public, works, and, for, the, duration, of, his, tenure, withheld, major, funds, for, the, project, only, in, 1844, when, a, new, governor, general, lord, hardinge, was, appointed, did, official, enthusiasm, and, funds, return, to, the, ganges, canal, project, although, the, intervening, impasse, had, seemingly, affected, cautley, s, health, and, required, him, to, return, to, britain, in, 1845, for, recuperation, his, european, sojourn, gave, him, an, opportunity, to, study, contemporary, hydraulic, works, in, the, united, kingdom, and, italy, by, the, time, of, his, return, to, india, even, more, supportive, men, were, at, the, helm, both, in, the, north, western, provinces, with, james, thomason, as, lt, governor, and, in, british, india, with, lord, dalhousie, as, governor, general, canal, construction, under, cautley, s, supervision, now, went, into, full, swing, a, 560, km, 350, mi, long, canal, with, another, 480, km, 300, mi, of, branch, lines, eventually, stretched, between, the, headworks, in, haridwar, splitting, into, two, branches, below, aligarh, and, its, two, confluences, with, the, yamuna, jumna, in, map, mainstem, in, etawah, and, the, ganges, in, kanpur, cawnpore, in, map, the, ganges, canal, which, required, a, total, capital, outlay, of, 2, 15, million, was, officially, opened, in, 1854, by, lord, dalhousie, according, to, historian, ian, stone, it, was, the, largest, canal, ever, attempted, in, the, world, five, times, greater, in, its, length, than, all, the, main, irrigation, lines, of, lombardy, and, egypt, put, together, and, longer, by, a, third, than, even, the, largest, usa, navigation, canal, the, pennsylvania, canal, a, major, barrage, at, farakka, was, opened, on, 21, april, 1975, it, is, located, close, to, the, point, where, the, main, flow, of, the, river, enters, bangladesh, and, the, tributary, hooghly, also, known, as, bhagirathi, continues, in, west, bengal, past, kolkata, this, barrage, which, feeds, the, hooghly, branch, of, the, river, by, a, 42, km, 26, mi, long, feeder, canal, and, its, water, flow, management, has, been, a, long, lingering, source, of, dispute, with, bangladesh, indo, bangladesh, ganges, water, treaty, signed, in, december, 1996, addressed, some, of, the, water, sharing, issues, between, india, and, bangladesh, there, is, lav, khush, barrage, across, the, river, ganges, in, kanpur, tehri, dam, was, constructed, on, bhagirathi, river, a, tributary, of, the, ganges, it, is, located, 1, 5, km, downstream, of, ganesh, prayag, the, place, where, bhilangana, meets, bhagirathi, bhagirathi, is, called, the, ganges, after, devprayag, construction, of, the, dam, in, an, earthquake, prone, area, was, controversial, bansagar, dam, was, built, on, the, sone, river, a, tributary, of, the, ganges, for, both, irrigation, and, hydroelectric, power, generation, ganges, floodwaters, along, with, brahmaputra, waters, can, be, supplied, to, most, of, its, right, side, basin, area, along, with, central, and, south, india, by, constructing, a, coastal, reservoir, to, store, water, on, the, bay, of, bengal, sea, area, the, ganges, basin, with, its, fertile, soil, is, instrumental, to, the, agricultural, economies, of, india, and, bangladesh, the, ganges, and, its, tributaries, provide, a, perennial, source, of, irrigation, to, a, large, area, chief, crops, cultivated, in, the, area, include, rice, sugarcane, lentils, oil, seeds, potatoes, and, wheat, along, the, banks, of, the, river, the, presence, of, swamps, and, lakes, provides, a, rich, growing, area, for, crops, such, as, legumes, chillies, mustard, sesame, sugarcane, and, jute, there, are, also, many, fishing, opportunities, along, the, river, though, it, remains, highly, polluted, also, the, major, industrial, towns, of, unnao, and, kanpur, situated, on, the, banks, of, the, river, with, the, predominance, of, tanning, industries, add, to, the, pollution, tourism, is, another, related, activity, three, towns, holy, to, hinduism, haridwar, prayagraj, and, varanasi, attract, millions, of, pilgrims, to, its, waters, to, take, a, dip, in, the, ganges, which, is, believed, to, cleanse, oneself, of, sins, and, help, attain, salvation, the, rapids, of, the, ganges, are, also, popular, for, river, rafting, in, the, town, of, rishikesh, attracting, adventure, seekers, in, the, summer, months, several, cities, such, as, kanpur, kolkata, and, patna, have, also, developed, riverfront, walkways, along, the, banks, to, attract, tourists, human, development, mostly, agriculture, has, replaced, nearly, all, of, the, original, natural, vegetation, of, the, ganges, basin, more, than, 95, of, the, upper, gangetic, plain, has, been, degraded, or, converted, to, agriculture, or, urban, areas, only, one, large, block, of, relatively, intact, habitat, remains, running, along, the, himalayan, foothills, and, including, rajaji, national, park, jim, corbett, national, park, and, dudhwa, national, park, as, recently, as, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, upper, gangetic, plain, harboured, impressive, populations, of, wild, asian, elephants, elephas, maximus, bengal, tigers, panthera, t, tigris, indian, rhinoceros,

wild, animals, mostly, deer, wild, boars, wildcats, and, small, numbers, of, indian, wolves, golden, jackals, and, red, and, bengal, foxes, bengal, tigers, survive, only, in, the, sundarbans, area, of, the, ganges, delta, the, sundarbands, freshwater, swamp, ecoregion, however, is, nearly, extinct, the, sundarbans, mangroves, heritiera, fomes, also, grow, in, the, sundarbans, area, of, the, ganges, delta, threatened, mammals, in, the, upper, gangetic, plain, include, the, tiger, elephant, sloth, bear, and, four, horned, antelope, tetracerus, quadricornis, many, types, of, birds, are, found, throughout, the, basin, such, as, myna, psittacula, parakeets, crows, kites, partridges, and, fowls, ducks, and, snipes, migrate, across, the, himalayas, during, the, winter, attracted, in, large, numbers, to, wetland, areas, there, are, no, endemic, birds, in, the, upper, gangetic, plain, the, great, indian, bustard, ardeotis, nigriceps, and, lesser, florican, sypheotides, indicus, are, considered, globally, threatened, the, natural, forest, of, the, upper, gangetic, plain, has, been, so, thoroughly, eliminated, it, is, difficult, to, assign, a, natural, vegetation, type, with, certainty, there, are, a, few, small, patches, of, forest, left, and, they, suggest, that, much, of, the, upper, plains, may, have, supported, a, tropical, moist, deciduous, forest, with, sal, shorea, robusta, as, a, climax, species, a, similar, situation, is, found, in, the, lower, gangetic, plain, which, includes, the, lower, brahmaputra, river, the, lower, plains, contain, more, open, forests, which, tend, to, be, dominated, by, bombax, ceiba, in, association, with, albizzia, procera, duabanga, grandiflora, and, sterculia, vilosa, there, are, early, seral, forest, communities, that, would, eventually, become, dominated, by, the, climax, species, sal, shorea, robusta, if, forest, succession, was, allowed, to, proceed, in, most, places, forests, fail, to, reach, climax, conditions, due, to, human, causes, the, forests, of, the, lower, gangetic, plain, despite, thousands, of, years, of, human, settlement, remained, largely, intact, until, the, early, 20th, century, today, only, about, 3, of, the, ecoregion, is, under, natural, forest, and, only, one, large, block, south, of, varanasi, remains, there, are, over, forty, protected, areas, in, the, ecoregion, but, over, half, of, these, are, less, than, 100, square, kilometres, 39, sq, mi, the, fauna, of, the, lower, gangetic, plain, is, similar, to, the, upper, plains, with, the, addition, of, a, number, of, other, species, such, as, the, smooth, coated, otter, lutrogale, perspicillata, and, the, large, indian, civet, viverra, zibetha, it, has, been, estimated, that, about, 350, fish, species, live, in, the, entire, ganges, drainage, including, several, endemics, in, a, major, 2007, 2009, study, of, fish, in, the, ganges, basin, including, the, river, itself, and, its, tributaries, but, excluding, the, brahmaputra, and, meghna, basins, a, total, of, 143, fish, species, were, recorded, including, 10, non, native, introduced, species, the, most, diverse, orders, are, cypriniformes, barbs, and, allies, siluriformes, catfish, and, perciformes, perciform, fish, each, comprising, about, 50, 23, and, 14, of, the, total, fish, species, in, the, drainage, there, are, distinct, differences, between, the, different, sections, of, the, river, basin, but, cyprinidae, is, the, most, diverse, throughout, in, the, upper, section, roughly, equalling, the, basin, parts, in, uttarakhand, more, than, 50, species, have, been, recorded, and, cyprinidae, alone, accounts, for, almost, 80, those, followed, by, balitoridae, about, 15, 6, and, sisoridae, about, 12, 2, sections, of, the, ganges, basin, at, altitudes, above, 2, 400, 3, 000, m, 7, 900, 9, 800, ft, above, sea, level, are, generally, without, fish, typical, genera, approaching, this, altitude, are, schizothorax, tor, barilius, nemacheilus, and, glyptothorax, about, 100, species, have, been, recorded, from, the, middle, section, of, the, basin, roughly, equalling, the, sections, in, uttar, pradesh, and, parts, of, bihar, and, more, than, 55, of, these, are, in, family, cyprinidae, followed, by, schilbeidae, about, 10, 6, and, clupeidae, about, 8, 6, the, lower, section, roughly, equalling, the, basin, in, parts, of, bihar, and, west, bengal, includes, major, floodplains, and, is, home, to, almost, 100, species, about, 46, of, these, are, in, the, family, cyprinidae, followed, by, schilbeidae, about, 11, 4, and, bagridae, about, 9, the, ganges, basin, supports, major, fisheries, but, these, have, declined, in, recent, decades, in, the, prayagraj, region, in, the, middle, section, of, the, basin, catches, of, carp, fell, from, 424, 91, metric, tons, in, 1961, 1968, to, 38, 58, metric, tons, in, 2001, 2006, and, catches, of, catfish, fell, from, 201, 35, metric, tons, in, 1961, 1968, to, 40, 56, metric, tons, in, 2001, 2006, in, the, patna, region, in, the, lower, section, of, the, basin, catches, of, carp, fell, from, 383, 2, metric, tons, to, 118, and, catfish, from, 373, 8, metric, tons, to, 194, 48, some, of, the,

species, that, are, listed, as, threatened, with, the, primary, issues, being, overfishing, sometimes, illegal, pollution, water, abstraction, siltation, and, invasive, species, among, the, threatened, species, is, the, critically, endangered, ganges, shark, glyphis, gangeticus, several, fish, species, migrate, between, different, sections, of, the, river, but, these, movements, may, be, prevented, by, the, building, of, dams, the, main, sections, of, the, ganges, river, are, home, to, the, gharial, gavialis, gangeticus, and, mugger, crocodile, crocodylus, palustris, and, the, ganges,

this, dolphin, used, to, exist, in, large, schools, near, urban, centres, in, both, the, ganges, and, brahmaputra, rivers, but, is, now, seriously, threatened, by, pollution, dam, construction, and, improper, fishing, methods, their, numbers, have, now, dwindled, to, a, quarter, of, their, numbers, of, fifteen, years, before, and, they, have, become, extinct, in, the, ganges, main, tributaries, a, 2012, survey, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, found, only, 3, 000, left, in, the, water, catchment, of, both, river, systems, the, ganges, river, dolphin, is, one, of, only, five, true, freshwater,

tocantins, basin, in, brazil, there, are, several, marine, dolphins, whose, ranges, include, some, freshwater, habitats, but, these, five, are, the, only, dolphins, who, live, only, in, freshwater, rivers, and, lakes, the, tibetan, plateau, contains, the, world, s, third, largest, store, of, ice, qin, dahe, the, former, head, of, the, china, meteorological, administration, said, that, the, recent, fast, pace, of, melting, and, warmer, temperatures, will, be, good, for, agriculture, and, tourism, in, the, short, term, but, issued, a, strong, warning, temperatures, are, rising, four, times, faster, than, elsewhere, in, china, and, the, tibetan, glaciers, are, retreating, at, a, higher, speed, than, in, any, other, part, of, the, world, in, the, short, term, this, will, cause, lakes, to, expand, and, bring, floods, and, mudflows, in, the, long, run, the, glaciers, are, vital, lifelines, for, asian, rivers, including, the, indus, and, the, ganges, once, they, vanish, water, supplies, in, those, regions, will, be, in, peril, in, 2007, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, in, its, fourth, report, stated, that, the, himalayan, glaciers, which, feed, the, river, were, at, risk, of, melting, by, 2035, the, ipcc, has, now, withdrawn, that, prediction, as, the, original, source, admitted, that, it, was, speculative, and, the, cited, source, was, not, a, peer, reviewed, finding, in, its, statement, the, ipcc, stands, by, its, general, findings, relating, to, the, himalayan, glaciers, being, at, risk, from, global, warming, with, consequent, risks, to, water, flow, into, the, gangetic, basin, many, studies, have, suggested, that, climate, change, will, affect, the, water, resources, in, the, ganges, river, basin, including, increased, summer, monsoon, flow, and, peak, runoff, could, result, in, an, increased, risk, of, flooding, the, ganges, suffers, from, extreme, pollution, levels, caused, by, the, 400, million, people, who, live, close, to, the, river, sewage, from, many, cities, along, the, river, s, course, industrial, waste, and, religious, offerings, wrapped, in, non, degradable, plastics, add, large, amounts, of, pollutants, to, the, river, as, it, flows, through, densely, populated, areas, the, problem, is, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, many, poorer, people, rely, on, the, river, on, a, daily, basis, for, bathing, washing, and, cooking, the, world, bank, estimates, that, the, health, costs, of, water, pollution, in, india, equal, three, percent, of, india, s, gdp, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, eighty, percent, of, all, illnesses, in, india, and, one, third, of, deaths, can, be, attributed, to, water, borne, diseases, varanasi, a, city, of, one, million, people, that, many, pilgrims, visit, to, take, a, holy, dip, in, the, ganges, releases, around, 200, million, liters, of, untreated, human, sewage, into, the, river, each, day, leading, to, large, concentrations, of, fecal, coliform, bacteria, according, to, official, standards, water, safe, for, bathing, should, not, contain, more, than, 500, fecal, coliforms, per, 100, ml, yet, upstream, of, varanasi, s, ghats, the, river, water, already, contains, 120, times, as, much, 60, 000, fecal, coliform, bacteria, per, 100, ml, after, the, cremation, of, the, deceased, at, varanasi, s, ghats, the, bones, and, ashes, are, immersed, into, the, ganges, however, in, the, past, thousands, of, uncremated, bodies, were, thrown, into, the, ganges, during, cholera, epidemics, spreading, the, disease, even, today, holy, men, pregnant, women, people, with, leprosy, or, chicken, pox, people, who, have, been, bitten, by, snakes, people, who, have, committed, suicide, the, poor, and, children, under, 5, are, not, cremated, at, the, ghats, but, are, left, to, float, free, to, decompose, in, the, waters, in, addition, those, who, cannot, afford, the, large, amount, of, wood, needed, to, incinerate, the, entire, body, leave, behind, many, half, burned, body, parts, after, passing, through, varanasi, and, receiving, 32, streams, of, raw, sewage, from, the, city, the, concentration, of, fecal, coliforms, in, the, river, s, waters, rises, from, 60, 000, to, 1, 5, million, with, observed, peak, values, of, 100, million, per, 100, ml, drinking, and, bathing, in, its, waters, therefore, carries, a, high, risk, of, infection, between, 1985, and, 2000, rs, 10, billion, around, us, 226, million, or, less, than, 4, cents, per, person, per, year, were, spent, on, the, ganga, action, plan, an, environmental, initiative, that, was, the, largest, single, attempt, to, clean, up, a, polluted, river, anywhere, in, the, world, the, ganga, action, plan, has, been, described, variously, as, a, failure, and, a, major, failure, according, to, one, study, the, ganga, action, plan, which, was, taken, on, priority, and, with, much, enthusiasm, was, delayed, for, two, years, the, expenditure, was, almost, doubled, but, the, result, was, not, very, appreciable, much, expenditure, was, done, on, political, propaganda, the, concerning, governments, and, the, related, agencies, were, not, very, prompt, to, make, it, a, success, the, public, of, the, areas, was, not, taken, into, consideration, the, release, of, urban, and, industrial, wastes, in, the, river, was, not, controlled, fully, the, flowing, of, dirty, water, through, drains, and, sewers, were, not, adequately, diverted, the, continuing, customs, of, burning, dead, bodies, throwing, carcasses, washing, of, dirty, clothes, by, washermen, and, immersion, of, idols, and, cattle, wallowing, were, not, checked, very, little, provision, of, public, latrines, was, made, and, the, open, defecation, of, lakhs, of, people, continued, along, the, riverside, all, these, made, the, action, plan, a, failure, the, failure, of, the, ganga, action, plan, has, also, been, variously, attributed, to, environmental, planning, without, proper, understanding, of, the, human, environment, interactions, indian, traditions, and, beliefs, corruption, and, a, lack, of, technical, knowledge, and, lack, of, support, from, religious, authorities, in, december, 2009, the, world, bank, agreed, to, loan, india, us, 1, billion, over, the, next, five, years, to, help, save, the, river, according, to, 2010, planning, commission, estimates, an, investment, of, almost, rs, 70, billion, rs, 70, billion, approximately, us, 1, 5, billion, is, needed, to, clean, up, the, river, in, november, 2008, the, ganges, alone, among, india, s, rivers, was, declared, a, national, river, facilitating, the, formation, of, a, national, ganga, river, basin, authority, that, would, have, greater, powers, to, plan, implement, and, monitor, measures, aimed, at, protecting, the, river, in, july, 2014, the, government, of, india, announced, an, integrated, ganges, development, project, titled, namami, gange, programme, and, allocated, 2, 037, crore, for, this, purpose, the, main, objectives, of, the, namami, gange, project, is, to, improve, the, water, quality, by, the, abatement, of, pollution, and, rejuvenation, of, river, ganga, by, creating, infrastructures, like, sewage, treatment, plants, river, surface, cleaning, biodiversity, conservation, afforestation, and, public, awareness, in, march, 2017, the, high, court, of, uttarakhand, declared, the, ganges, river, a, legal, person, in, a, move, that, according, to, one, newspaper, could, help, in, efforts, to, clean, the, pollution, choked, rivers, as, of, 6, april, 2017, the,
