the, ross, sea, is, a, deep, bay, of, the, southern, ocean, in, antarctica, between, victoria, land, and, marie, byrd, land, and, within, the, ross, embayment, and, is, the, southernmost, sea, on, earth, it, derives, its, name, from, the, british, explorer, james, clark, ross, who, visited, this, area, in, 1841, to, the, west, of, the, sea, lies, ross, island, and, victoria, land, to, the, east, roosevelt, island, and, edward, vii, peninsula, in, marie, byrd, land, while, the, southernmost, part, is, covered, by, the, ross, ice, shelf, and, is, about, 200, miles, 320, km, from, the, south, pole, its, boundaries, and, area, have, been, defined, by, the, new, zealand, national, institute, of, water, and, atmospheric, research, as, having, an, area, of, 637, 000, square, kilometres, 246, 000, sq, mi, the, circulation, of, the, ross, sea, is, dominated, by, a, wind, driven, ocean, gyre, and, the, flow, is, strongly, influenced, by, three, submarine, ridges, that, run, from, southwest, to, northeast, the, circumpolar, deep, water, current, is, a, relatively, warm, salty, and, nutrient, rich, water, mass, that, flows, onto, the, continental, shelf, at, certain, locations, the, ross, sea, is, covered, with, ice, for, most, of, the, year, the, nutrient, laden, water, supports, an, abundance, of, plankton, and, this, encourages, a, rich, marine, fauna, at, least, ten, mammal, species, six, bird, species, and, 95, fish, species, are, found, here, as, well, as, many, invertebrates, and, the, sea, remains, relatively, unaffected, by, human, activities, new, zealand, has, claimed, that, the, sea, comes, under, its, jurisdiction, as, part, of, the, ross, dependency, marine, biologists, consider, the, sea, to, have, a, high, level, of, biological, diversity, and, it, is, the, site, of, much, scientific, research, it, is, also, the, focus, of, some, environmentalist, groups, who, have, campaigned, to, have, the, area, proclaimed, as, a, world, marine, reserve, in, 2016, an, international, agreement, established, the, region, as, a, marine, park, the, ross, sea, was, discovered, by, the, ross, expedition, in, 1841, in, the, west, of, the, ross, sea, is, ross, island, with, the, mt, erebus, volcano, in, the, east, is, roosevelt, island, the, southern, part, is, covered, by, the, ross, ice, shelf, roald, amundsen, started, his, south, pole, expedition, in, 1911, from, the, bay, of, whales, which, was, located, at, the, shelf, in, the, western, parts, of, the, ross, sea, mcmurdo, sound, is, a, port, that, is, usually, free, of, ice, during, the, summer, the, southernmost, part, of, the, ross, sea, is, gould, coast, which, is, approximately, 200, miles, 320, km, from, the, geographic, south, pole, the, ross, sea, and, ross, ice, shelf, overlies, a, deep, continental, shelf, although, the, average, depth, of, the, world, s, continental, shelves, at, the, shelf, break, joining, the, continental, slope, is, about, 130, meters, the, ross, shelf, average, depth, is, about, 500, meters, it, is, shallower, in, the, western, ross, sea, east, longitudes, than, the, east, west, longitudes, this, over, deepened, condition, is, due, to, cycles, of, erosion, and, deposition, of, sediments, from, expanding, and, contracting, ice, sheets, overriding, the, shelf, during, oligocene, and, later, time, and, is, also, found, on, other, locations, around, antarctica, erosion, was, more, focused, on, the, inner, parts, of, the, shelf, while, deposition, of, sediment, dominated, the, outer, shelf, making, the, inner, shelf, deeper, than, the, outer, seismic, studies, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, defined, the, major, features, of, the, geology, of, the, ross, sea, the, deepest, or, basement, rocks, are, faulted, into, four, major, north, trending, graben, systems, which, are, basins, for, sedimentary, fill, these, basins, include, the, northern, and, victoria, land, basin, in, the, west, the, central, trough, and, the, eastern, basin, which, has, approximately, the, same, width, as, the, other, three, the, coulman, high, separates, the, victoria, land, basin, and, central, trough, and, the, central, high, separates, the, central, trough, and, eastern, basin, the, majority, of, the, faulting, and, accompanying, graben, formation, along, with, crustal, extension, occurred, during, the, rifting, away, of, the, zealandia, microcontinent, from, antarctica, in, gondwana, during, cretaceous, time, paleogene, and, neogene, age, and, faulting, and, extension, is, restricted, to, the, victoria, land, basin, and, northern, basin, basement, grabens, are, filled, with, rift, sediments, of, uncertain, character, and, age, a, widespread, unconformity, has, cut, into, the, basement, and, sedimentary, fill, of, the, large, basins, above, this, major, unconformity, named, rsu, 6, are, a, series, of, glacial, marine, sedimentary, units, deposited, during, multiple, advances, and, retreats, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, across, the, sea, floor, of, the, ross, sea, during, the, oligocene, and, later, drill, holes, have, recovered, cores, of, rock, from, the, western, edges, of, the, sea, the, most, ambitious, recent, efforts, are, the, cape, roberts, project, crp, and, the, andrill, project, deep, sea, drilling, project, dsdp, leg, 28, completed, several, holes, 270, 273, farther, from, land, in, the, central, and, western, portions, of, the, sea, these, resulted, in, defining, a, stratigraphy, for, most, of, the, older, glacial, sequences, which, comprise, oligocene, and, younger, sediments, the, ross, sea, wide, major, unconformity, rsu, 6, has, been, proposed, to, mark, a, global, climate, event, and, the, first, appearance, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, in, the, oligocene, during, 2018, expedition, 374, of, the, international, ocean, discovery, program, iodp, the, latest, successor, to, the, dsdp, drilled, additional, holes, u1521, 1525, in, the, central, ross, sea, for, determining, neogene, and, quaternary, ice, sheet, history, the, nature, of, the, basement, rocks, and, the, fill, within, the, grabens, are, known, in, few, locations, basement, rocks, have, been, sampled, at, dsdp, leg, 28, drill, site, 270, where, metamorphic, rocks, of, unknown, age, were, recovered, and, in, the, eastern, ross, sea, where, a, bottom, dredge, was, collected, in, both, these, locations, the, metamorphic, rocks, are, mylonites, deformed, in, the, cretaceous, suggesting, extreme, stretching, of, the, ross, embayment, during, that, time, marie, byrd, land, rocks, exposed, in, western, marie, byrd, land, on, the, edward, vii, peninsula, and, within, the, ford, ranges, are, candidates, for, basement, in, the, eastern, ross, sea, the, oldest, rocks, are, permian, sediments, of, the, swanson, formation, which, is, slightly, metamorphosed, the, ford, granodiorite, of, devonian, age, intrudes, these, sediments, cretaceous, byrd, coast, granite, in, turn, intrudes, the, older, rocks, the, byrd, coast, and, older, formations, have, been, cut, by, basalt, dikes, scattered, through, the, ford, ranges, and, fosdick, mountains, are, late, cenozoic, volcanic, rocks, that, are, not, found, to, the, west, on, edward, vii, peninsula, metamorphic, rocks, migmatites, are, found, in, the, fosdick, mountains, and, alexandra, mountains, these, were, metamorphosed, and, deformed, in, the, cretaceous, the, ross, supergroup, system, and, beacon, supergroup, ross, system, rocks, exposed, in, victoria, land, and, in, the, transantarctic, mountains, on, the, western, side, of, the, ross, sea, are, possible, basement, rock, below, the, sedimentary, cover, of, the, sea, floor, the, rocks, are, of, upper, precambrian, to, lower, paleozoic, in, age, deformed, in, many, places, during, the, ross, orogeny, in, the, cambrian, these, miogeosyncline, metasedimentary, rocks, are, partly, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, often, including, limestone, groups, within, the, ross, system, include, the, robertson, bay, group, priestley, group, skelton, group, beardmore, group, byrd, group, queen, maud, group, and, koettlitz, group, the, robertson, bay, group, compares, closely, with, other, ross, system, members, the, priestley, group, rocks, are, similar, to, those, of, the, robertson, bay, group, and, include, dark, slates, argillites, siltstones, fine, sandstones, and, limestones, they, can, be, found, near, the, priestley, and, campbell, glaciers, for, thirty, miles, along, the, lower, skelton, glacier, are, the, calcareous, greywackes, and, argillites, of, the, skelton, group, the, region, between, the, lower, beardmore, glacier, and, the, lower, shackelton, glacier, sits, the, beardmore, group, north, of, the, nimrod, glacier, are, four, block, faulted, ranges, that, make, up, the, byrd, group, the, contents, of, the, queen, maud, group, area, are, mainly, post, tectonic, granite, beacon, sandstone, of, devonian, triassic, age, and, the, ferarr, volcanic, rocks, of, jurassic, age, are, separated, from, the, ross, supergroup, by, the, kukri, peneplain, beacon, rocks, are, reported, to, have, been, recovered, in, the, drill, cores, of, the, cape, roberts, project, at, the, western, edge, of, the, ross, sea, the, ross, sea, circulation, dominated, by, polynya, processes, is, in, general, very, slow, moving, circumpolar, deep, water, cdw, is, a, relatively, warm, salty, and, nutrient, rich, water, mass, that, flows, onto, the, continental, shelf, at, certain, locations, in, the, ross, sea, through, heat, flux, this, water, mass, moderates, the, ice, cover, the, near, surface, water, also, provides, a, warm, environment, for, some, animals, and, nutrients, to, excite, primary, production, cdw, transport, onto, the, shelf, is, known, to, be, persistent, and, periodic, and, is, thought, to, occur, at, specific, locations, influenced, by, bottom, topography, the, circulation, of, the, ross, sea, is, dominated, by, a, wind, driven, gyre, the, flow, is, strongly, influenced, by, three, submarine, ridges, that, run, from, southwest, to, northeast, flow, over, the, shelf, below, the, surface, layer, consists, of, two, anticyclonic, gyres, connected, by, a, central, cyclonic, flow, the, flow, is, considerable, in, spring, and, winter, due, to, influencing, tides, the, ross, sea, is, covered, with, ice, for, much, of, the, year, and, ice, concentrations, and, in, the, south, central, region, little, melting, occurs, ice, concentrations, in, the, ross, sea, are, influenced, by, winds, with, ice, remaining, in, the, western, region, throughout, the, austral, spring, and, generally, melting, in, january, due, to, local, heating, this, leads, to, extremely, strong, stratification, and, shallow, mixed, layers, in, the, western, ross, sea, observation, and, data, access, in, the, region, is, coordinated, by, the, ross, sea, working, group, of, the, southern, ocean, observing, system, the, ross, sea, is, one, of, the, last, stretches, of, seas, on, earth, that, remains, relatively, unaffected, by, human, activities, consequently, the, ross, sea, has, become, a, focus, of, numerous, environmentalist, groups, who, have, campaigned, to, make, the, area, a, world, marine, reserve, citing, the, rare, opportunity, to, protect, the, ross, sea, from, a, growing, number, of, threats, and, destruction, the, ross, sea, is, regarded, by, marine, biologists, as, having, a, very, high, biological, diversity, and, as, such, has, a, long, history, of, human, exploration, and, scientific, research, with, some, datasets, going, back, over, 150, years, the, ross, sea, is, home, to, at, least, 10, mammal, species, half, a, dozen, species, of, birds, 95, species, of, fish, and, over, 1, 000, invertebrate, species, some, species, of, birds, that, nest, in, and, near, the, ross, sea, include, the, ad, lie, penguin, emperor, penguin, antarctic, petrel, snow, petrel, and, south, polar, skua, marine, mammals, in, the, ross, sea, include, the, antarctic, minke, whale, killer, whale, weddell, seal, crabeater, seal, and, leopard, seal, antarctic, toothfish, antarctic, silverfish, antarctic, krill, and, crystal, krill, also, swim, in, the, cold, antarctic, water, of, the, ross, sea, the, flora, and, fauna, are, considered, similar, to, other, southern, antarctic, marine, regions, particularly, in, summer, the, nutrient, rich, sea, water, supports, an, abundant, planktonic, life, in, turn, providing, food, for, larger, species, such, as, fish, seals, whales, and, sea, and, shore, birds, albatrosses, rely, on, wind, to, travel, and, cannot, get, airborne, in, a, calm, the, westerlies, do, not, extend, as, far, south, as, the, ice, edge, and, therefore, albatrosses, do, not, travel, often, to, the, ice, pack, an, albatross, would, be, trapped, on, an, ice, floe, for, many, days, if, it, landed, in, the, calm, the, coastal, parts, of, the, sea, contain, a, number, of, rookeries, of, ad, lie, and, emperor, penguins, which, have, been, observed, at, a, number, of, places, around, the, ross, sea, both, towards, the, coast, and, outwards, in, open, sea, a, 10, metre, 32, 8, feet, long, colossal, squid, weighing, 495, kilograms, 1, 091, lb, was, captured, in, the, ross, sea, on, february, 22, 2007, in, 2010, the, ross, sea, antarctic, toothfish, fishery, was, independently, certified, by, the, marine, stewardship, council, and, has, been, rated, as, a, good, alternative, by, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, seafood, watch, program, however, a, 2008, document, submitted, to, the, commission, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, ccamlr, reported, significant, declines, in, toothfish, populations, of, mcmurdo, sound, coinciding, with, the, development, of, the, industrial, toothfishing, industry, since, 1996, and, other, reports, have, noted, a, coincident, decrease, in, the, number, of, orcas, the, report, recommended, a, full, moratorium, on, fishing, over, the, ross, shelf, in, october, 2012, philippa, ross, james, ross, great, great, great, granddaughter, voiced, her, opposition, to, fishing, in, the, area, in, the, southern, winter, of, 2017, new, zealand, scientists, discovered, the, breeding, ground, of, the, antarctic, toothfish, in, the, northern, ross, sea, seamounts, for, the, first, time, underscoring, how, little, is, known, about, the, species, on, 28, october, 2016, at, its, annual, meeting, in, hobart, a, ross, sea, marine, park, was, declared, by, the, ccamlr, under, an, agreement, signed, by, 24, countries, and, the, european, union, it, protected, over, 1, 5, million, square, kilometers, of, sea, and, was, the, world, s, largest, protected, area, at, the, time, however, a, sunset, provision, of, 35, years, was, part, of, negotiations, which, means, it, does, not, meet, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, definition, of, a, marine, protected, area, which, requires, it, to, be, permanent, beginning, in, 2005, the, commission, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, ccamlr, commissioned, scientific, analysis, and, planning, for, marine, protected, areas, mpa, in, the, antarctic, in, 2010, the, ccamlr, endorsed, their, scientific, committee, s, proposal, to, develop, antarctic, mpas, for, conservation, purposes, the, us, state, department, submitted, a, proposal, for, a, ross, sea, mpa, at, the, september, 2012, meeting, of, the, ccamlr, at, this, stage, a, sustained, campaign, by, various, international, and, national, ngos, commenced, to, accelerate, the, process, in, july, 2013, the, ccamlr, held, a, meeting, in, bremerhaven, in, germany, to, decide, whether, to, turn, the, ross, sea, into, an, mpa, the, deal, failed, due, to, russia, voting, against, it, citing, uncertainty, about, whether, the, commission, had, the, authority, to, establish, a, marine, protected, area, in, october, 2014, the, mpa, proposal, was, again, defeated, at, the, ccamlr, by, votes, against, from, china, and, russia, at, the, october, 2015, meeting, a, revised, mpa, proposal, from, the, us, and, new, zealand, was, expanded, with, the, assistance, of, china, who, however, shifted, the, mpa, s, priorities, from, conservation, by, allowing, commercial, fishing, the, proposal, was, again, blocked, by, russia, media, related, to, ross, sea, at, wikimedia, commons
