from, europe, and, semi, and, un, skilled, black, workers, imported, from, other, parts, of, southern, africa, though, they, worked, together, they, were, forced, by, the, government, to, live, separately, work, was, considered, to, be, an, exception, to, apartheid, in, order, to, keep, johannesburg, functioning, as, south, africa, s, economic, capital, in, the, 1950s, the, government, began, a, policy, of, building, townships, for, black, families, prior, to, this, unskilled, workers, were, asked, to, work, on, single, status, in, male, only, hostels, at, the, mines, and, had, to, commute, to, see, their, families, in, whatever, province, they, originated, outside, of, johannesburg, to, provide, workers, for, johannesburg, soweto, a, township, founded, for, black, workers, coming, to, work, in, the, gold, mines, of, johannesburg, was, intended, to, house, 50, 000, people, but, soon, was, the, home, of, ten, times, that, number, as, thousands, of, unemployed, rural, blacks, came, to, johannesburg, for, employment, and, an, income, to, send, back, to, their, villages, it, was, estimated, that, in, 1989, the, population, of, soweto, was, equal, to, that, of, johannesburg, if, not, greater, in, march, 1960, johannesburg, witnessed, widespread, demonstrations, against, apartheid, in, response, to, the, sharpeville, massacre, on, 11, july, 1963, the, south, african, police, raided, a, house, in, the, johannesburg, suburb, of, rivonia, where, nine, members, of, the, banned, african, national, congress, anc, were, arrested, on, charges, of, planning,

fiercest, struggles, between, the, police, and, anti, apartheid, demonstrators, the, central, area, of, the, city, underwent, something, of, a, decline, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, due, to, the, high, crime, rate, and, when, property, speculators, directed, large, amounts, of, capital, into, suburban, shopping, malls, decentralised, office, parks, and, entertainment, centres, sandton, city, was, opened, in, 1973, followed, by, rosebank, mall, in, 1976, and, eastgate, in, 1979, during, the, 1990s, the, city, faced, rapid, growth, of, crime, throughout, large, parts, of, the, city, some, areas,

on, the, site, after, being, destroyed, the, site, will, consist, of, a, 5, 000, m, 2, 54, 000, sq, ft, precinct, on, 12, may, 2008, a, series, of, riots, started, in, the, township, of, alexandra, in, the, north, eastern, part, of, johannesburg, when, locals, attacked, migrants, from, mozambique, malawi, and, zimbabwe, killing, two, people, and, injuring, 40, others, these, riots, sparked, the,

but, its, streams, contribute, to, two, of, southern, africa, s, mightiest, rivers, the, limpopo, and, the, orange, most, of, the, springs, from, which, many, of, these, streams, emanate, are, now, covered, in, concrete, and, canalised, accounting, for, the, fact, that, the, names, of, early, farms, in, the, area, often, end, with, fontein, meaning, spring, in, afrikaans, braamfontein, rietfontein, zevenfontein, doornfontein, zandfontein, and, randjesfontein, are, some, examples, when, the, first, white, settlers, reached, the, area, that, is, now, johannesburg, they, noticed, the, glistening, rocks, on, the, ridges, running, with, trickles, of, water, fed, by, the, streams, giving, the, area, its, name, the, witwatersrand, the, ridge, of, white, waters, another, explanation, is, that, the, whiteness, comes, from, the, quartzite, rock, which, has, a, particular, sheen, to, it, after, rain, the, site, was, not, chosen, for, its, streams, however, the, main, reasons, the, city, was, founded, where, it, stands, today, was, because, of, the, gold, indeed, the, city, once, sat, near, massive, amounts, of, gold, given, that, at, one, point, the, witwatersrand, gold,
