the, newly, formed, nation, faced, various, challenges, particularly, from, military, actions, in, the, vicinity, although, institutions, like, the, instituto, nacional, and, the, national, library, were, established, during, the, patria, vieja, they, were, shut, down, after, the, patriots, defeat, at, the, battle, of, rancagua, in, 1814, the, royal, government, continued, until, 1817, when, the, army, of, the, andes, emerged, victorious, at, the, battle, of, chacabuco, and, restored, the, patriot, government, in, santiago, however, independence, was, still, uncertain, the, spanish, army, achieved, further, victories, in, 1818, and, advanced, toward, santiago, but, their, progress, was, finally, halted, at, the, battle, of, maip, on, april, 5, 1818, on, the, maipo, river, plains, with,

expansion, to, the, south, and, west, of, the, capital, as, well, as, the, growth, of, the, bustling, district, of, la, chimba, which, resulted, from, the, division, of, old, properties, in, the, area, this, new, peripheral, development, marked, the, end, of, the, previous, checkerboard, structure, that, had, dominated, the, city, center, during, the, republican, era, several, institutions, were, founded, including, the, university, of, chile, the, normal, school, of, preceptors, the, school, of, arts, and, crafts, and, the, quinta, normal, the, latter, comprised, the, museum, of, fine,

initiated, the, construction, of, the, camino, de, cintura, a, road, surrounding, the, entire, city, the, redevelopment, of, alameda, avenue, also, took, place, during, this, time, turning, it, into, the, city, s, main, road, also, during, this, era, o, higgins, park, was, established, with, the, help, of, european, landscapers, in, 1873, the, public, park, known, for, its, large, gardens, lakes,

officially, opened, in, 1884, during, this, period, rail, lines, connected, santiago, to, valpara, so, and, regions, in, northern, and, southern, chile, the, streets, of, santiago, were, also, paved, and, by, 1875, there, were, 1, 107, railway, cars, in, the, city, while, 45, 000, people, used, trams, daily, as, the, new, century, began, santiago, underwent, various, changes, due, to, the, rapid, growth, of, industry, valpara, so, which, had, previously, been, the, economic, center, of, the, country, gradually, lost, its, prominence, to, the, capital, by, 1895, 75, of, the, national, manufacturing, industry, was, located, in, santiago, while, only, 28, was, in, valpara, so, by, 1910, major, banks, and, shops, had, established, themselves, in, the, central, streets, of, santiago, further, diminishing, the, role, of, valpara, so, the, enactment, of, the, autonomous, municipalities, act, empowered, municipalities, to, establish, various, administrative, divisions, within, the, santiago, department, with, the, goal, of, enhancing, local, governance, in, 1891, the, municipalities, of, maip, u, oa, renca, lampa, and, colina, were, created, followed, by, providencia, and, barrancas, in, 1897, and, las, condes, in, 1901, the, la, victoria, departmento, was, also, divided, leading, to, the, creation, of, lo, ca, as, in, 1891, which, was, then, further, split, into, la, granja, and, puente, alto, in, 1892, followed, by, la, florida, in, 1899, and, la, cisterna, in, 1925, the, san, cristobal, hill, underwent, a, prolonged, process, of, development, during, this, period, in, 1903, an, astronomical, observatory, was, established, on, the, hill, and, the, following, year, construction, began, on, a, 14, metre, 46, ft, statue, of, the, virgin, mary, today, the, statue, is, visible, from, various, points, in, the, city, however, the, shrine, was, not, completed, until, several, decades, later, the, 1910, chile, centennial, celebrations, marked, the, beginning, of, several, urban, development, projects, the, railway, network, was, expanded, connecting, the, city, and, its, growing, suburbs, with, a, new, ring, and, route, to, caj, n, del, maipo, a, new, railway, station, was, also, built, in, the, north, of, the, city, the, mapocho, station, the, parque, forestal, was, established, on, the, southern, side, of, the, mapocho, river, and, new, buildings, such, as, the, museum, of, fine, arts, the, barros, arana, public, boarding, school, and, the, national, library, were, opened, in, addition, a, sewer, system, was, installed, serving, approximately, 85, of, the, city, s, population, the, 1920, census, estimated, the, population, of, santiago, to, be, 507, 296, inhabitants, equivalent, to, 13, 6, of, the, total, population, of, chile, this, represented, a, growth, of, 52, 5, from, the, 1907, census, an, annual, increase, of, 3, 3, which, was, almost, three, times, the, national, average, this, growth, was, mainly, due, to, an, influx, of, farmers, from, the, southern, regions, who, came, to, work, in, the, factories, and, railroads, that, were, being, built, however, this, growth, was, concentrated, in, the, suburbs, and, not, in, the, city, center, during, this, time, the, downtown, district, consolidated, as, a, commercial, financial, and, administrative, center, with, the, establishment, of, various, shops, and, businesses, around, ahumada, street, and, a, civic, district, in, the, vicinity, of, the, palace, of, la, moneda, the, latter, project, involved, the, construction, of, modernist, buildings, for, the, offices, of, the, ministries, and, other, public, services, as, well, as, the, start, of, the, construction, of, medium, rise, buildings, meanwhile, the, traditional, residents, of, the, center, began, to, migrate, to, more, rural, areas, like, providencia, and, u, oa, which, attracted, the, oligarchy, and, european, immigrant, professionals, and, san, miguel, for, middle, class, families, additionally, in, the, periphery, villas, were, built, by, various, organizations, of, the, time, modernity, also, spread, in, the, city, with, the, introduction, of, the, first, theaters, the, expansion, of, the, telephone, network, and, the, opening, of, los, cerrillos, airport, in, 1928, among, other, advancements, the, perception, that, the, early, 20th, century, was, a, time, of, economic, prosperity, due, to, technological, advancements, was, in, stark, contrast, to, the, living, conditions, of, lower, social, classes, the, previous, decades, of, growth, resulted, in, an, unprecedented, population, boom, starting, in, 1929, but, was, met, with, tragedy, as, the, great, depression, hit, the, collapse, of, the, nitrate, industry, in, the, north, left, 60, 000, people, unemployed, compounded, by, a, decline, in, agricultural, exports, resulting, in, an, estimated, 300, 000, unemployed, people, nationwide, desperate, for, survival, many, migrants, flocked, to, santiago, and, its, thriving, industry, however, they, often, found, themselves, struggling, to, find, housing, with, many, being, forced, to, live, on, the, streets, the, harsh, living, conditions, resulted, in, widespread, diseases, like, tuberculosis, and, took, a, toll, on, the, homeless, population, at, the, same, time, unemployment, rates, and, living, costs, skyrocketed, while, the, salaries, of, the, people, in, santiago, fell, the, situation, would, change, several, years, later, with, a, new, industrial, boom, fostered, by, corfo, and, the, expansion, of, the, state, apparatus, from, the, late, 1930s, at, this, time, the, aristocracy, lost, much, of, its, power, and, the, middle, class, composed, of, merchants, bureaucrats, and, professionals, acquired, the, role, of, setting, national, policy, in, this, context, santiago, began, to, develop, a, substantial, middle, and, lower, class, population, while, the, upper, classes, sought, refuge, in, the, districts, of, the, capital, thus, the, old, moneyed, class, who, previously, frequented, cousi, o, and, alameda, park, lost, their, hegemony, over, popular, entertainment, venues, and, the, national, stadium, emerged, in, 1938, in, the, following, decades, santiago, continued, to, grow, at, an, unprecedented, rate, in, 1940, the, city, had, a, population, of, 952, 075, residents, which, increased, to, 1, 350, 409, by, 1952, and, reached, 1, 907, 378, in, the, 1960, census, this, growth, was, reflected, in, the, urbanization, of, rural, areas, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, where, middle, and, lower, class, families, with, stable, housing, were, established, in, 1930, the, urban, area, covered, 6, 500, hectares, which, increased, to, 20, 900, in, 1960, and, to, 38, 296, in, 1980, although, growth, was, mainly, concentrated, in, communities, such, as, barrancas, to, the, west, conchal, to, the, north, and, la, cisterna, and, la, granja, to, the, south, the, center, of, the, city, lost, population, leaving, more, space, for, commercial, banking, and, government, development, the, upper, class, on, the, other, hand, began, to, settle, in, the, foothills, of, las, condes, and, the, la, reina, sector, the, regulation, of, growth, in, santiago, only, began, in, the, 1960s, with, the, creation, of, various, development, plans, for, greater, santiago, a, concept, that, reflected, the, city, s, new, reality, as, a, much, larger, urban, center, in, 1958, the, intercommunal, plan, of, santiago, was, released, which, proposed, a, limit, of, 38, 600, urban, and, semi, urban, hectares, for, a, maximum, population, of, 3, 260, 000, residents, the, plan, also, included, plans, for, the, construction, of, new, avenues, such, as, the, am, rico, vespucio, avenue, and, panamericana, route, 5, as, well, as, the, expansion, of, industrial, belts, the, 1962, world, cup, provided, a, new, impetus, for, city, improvement, efforts, and, in, 1966, the, santiago, metropolitan, park, was, established, on, cerro, san, crist, bal, the, ministry, of, housing, and, urbanism, minvu, also, began, to, eradicate, shantytowns, and, build, new, homes, finally, the, edificio, diego, portales, was, constructed, in, 1972, in, 1967, the, new, pudahuel, international, airport, was, opened, and, after, years, of, discussion, construction, of, the, santiago, metro, began, in, 1969, the, first, phase, of, the, metro, which, ran, beneath, the, western, section, of, alameda, was, opened, in, 1975, and, soon, became, one, of, the, most, prestigious, buildings, in, the, city, over, the, following, years, the, metro, continued, to, expand, with, two, perpendicular, lines, in, place, by, the, end, of, 1978, building, telecommunications, infrastructure, was, also, an, important, development, of, this, period, as, reflected, in, the, construction, of, the, torre, entel, which, since, its, construction, in, 1975, has, become, one, of, the, symbols, of, the, capital, and, remained, the, tallest, structure, in, the, country, for, two, decades, after, the, military, coup, of, 1973, and, the, establishment, of, the, military, regime, significant, changes, in, urban, planning, did, not, occur, until, the, 1980s, when, the, government, embraced, a, neoliberal, economic, model, in, 1979, the, master, plan, was, revised, expanding, the, urban, area, to, over, 62, 000, hectares, for, real, estate, development, this, led, to, urban, sprawl, particularly, in, la, florida, causing, the, city, to, reach, 40, 619, hectares, in, size, in, the, early, 1990s, according, to, the, 1992, census, santiago, became, the, country, s, most, populous, municipality, with, 328, 881, residents, tragically, a, powerful, earthquake, struck, the, city, on, 3, march, 1985, causing, minimal, casualties, but, leaving, many, homeless, and, destroying, numerous, historic, buildings, with, the, onset, of, the, transition, to, democracy, in, 1990, the, city, of,
