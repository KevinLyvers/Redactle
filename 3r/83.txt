the, kara, sea, is, a, marginal, sea, separated, from, the, barents, sea, to, the, west, by, the, kara, strait, and, novaya, zemlya, and, from, the, laptev, sea, to, the, east, by, the, severnaya, zemlya, archipelago, ultimately, the, kara, barents, and, laptev, seas, are, all, extensions, of, the, arctic, ocean, north, of, siberia, the, kara, sea, s, northern, limit, is, marked, geographically, by, a, line, running, from, cape, kohlsaat, in, graham, bell, island, franz, josef, land, to, cape, molotov, arctic, cape, the, northernmost, point, of, komsomolets, island, in, severnaya, zemlya, the, kara, sea, is, roughly, 1, 450, km, 900, mi, long, and, 970, km, 600, mi, wide, with, an, area, of, around, 880, 000, km, 2, 339, 770, sq, mi, and, a, mean, depth, of, 110, metres, 360, ft, its, main, ports, are, novy, port, and, dikson, and, it, is, important, as, a, fishing, ground, although, the, sea, is, ice, bound, for, all, but, two, months, of, the, year, the, kara, sea, contains, the, east, prinovozemelsky, field, an, extension, of, the, west, siberian, oil, basin, containing, significant, undeveloped, petroleum, and, natural, gas, in, 2014, us, government, sanctions, resulted, in, exxon, having, until, 26, september, to, discontinue, its, operations, in, the, kara, sea, it, is, named, after, the, kara, river, flowing, into, baydaratskaya, bay, which, is, now, relatively, insignificant, but, which, played, an, important, role, in, the, russian, conquest, of, northern, siberia, the, kara, river, name, is, derived, from, a, nenets, word, meaning, hummocked, ice, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, kara, sea, as, follows, there, are, many, islands, and, island, groups, in, the, kara, sea, unlike, the, other, marginal, seas, of, the, arctic, where, most, islands, lie, along, the, coasts, in, the, kara, sea, many, islands, like, the, arkticheskiy, institut, islands, the, izvesti, tsik, islands, the, kirov, islands, uedineniya, or, lonely, island, wiese, island, and, voronina, island, are, located, in, the, open, sea, of, its, central, regions, the, largest, group, in, the, kara, sea, is, by, far, the, nordenski, ld, archipelago, with, five, large, subgroups, and, over, ninety, islands, other, important, islands, in, the, kara, sea, are, bely, island, dikson, island, taymyr, island, the, kamennyye, islands, and, oleni, island, despite, the, high, latitude, all, islands, are, unglaciated, except, for, ushakov, island, at, the, extreme, northern, limit, of, the, kara, sea, water, circulation, patterns, in, the, kara, sea, are, complex, the, kara, sea, tends, to, be, sea, ice, covered, between, september, and, may, and, between, may, and, august, heavily, influenced, by, freshwater, run, off, roughly, 1200, km, 3, yr, 1, from, the, russian, rivers, e, g, ob, yenisei, pyasina, pur, and, taz, the, kara, sea, is, also, affected, by, the, water, inflow, from, the, barents, sea, which, brings, 0, 6, sv, in, august, and, 2, 6, sv, in, december, the, advected, water, originates, from, the, atlantic, but, it, was, cooled, and, mixed, with, freshwater, in, the, barents, sea, before, it, reaches, the, kara, sea, simulations, with, the, hamburg, shelf, ocean, model, hamsom, suggest, that, no, typical, water, current, pattern, consists, in, the, kara, sea, throughout, the, year, depending, on, the, freshwater, run, off, the, dominant, wind, patterns, and, the, sea, ice, formation, the, water, currents, change, barents, sea, is, the, fastest, warming, part, of, the, arctic, and, some, assessments, now, treat, barents, sea, ice, as, a, separate, tipping, point, from, the, rest, of, the, arctic, sea, ice, suggesting, that, it, could, permanently, disappear, once, the, global, warming, exceeds, 1, 5, degrees, this, rapid, warming, also, makes, it, easier, to, detect, any, potential, connections, between, the, state, of, sea, ice, and, weather, conditions, elsewhere, than, in, any, other, area, the, first, study, proposing, a, connection, between, floating, ice, decline, in, the, barents, sea, and, the, neighbouring, kara, sea, and, more, intense, winters, in, europe, was, published, in, 2010, and, there, has, been, extensive, research, into, this, subject, since, then, for, instance, a, 2019, paper, holds, bks, ice, decline, responsible, for, 44, of, the, 1995, 2014, central, eurasian, cooling, trend, far, more, than, indicated, by, the, models, while, another, study, from, that, year, suggests, that, the, decline, in, bks, ice, reduces, snow, cover, in, the, north, eurasia, but, increases, it, in, central, europe, there, are, also, potential, links, to, summer, precipitation, a, connection, has, been, proposed, between, the, reduced, bks, ice, extent, in, november, december, and, greater, june, rainfall, over, south, china, one, paper, even, identified, a, connection, between, kara, sea, ice, extent, and, the, ice, cover, of, lake, qinghai, on, the, tibetan, plateau, the, kara, sea, was, formerly, known, as, oceanus, scythicus, or, mare, glaciale, and, it, appears, with, these, names, in, 16th, century, maps, since, it, is, closed, by, ice, most, of, the, year, it, remained, largely, unexplored, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, in, 1556, stephen, borough, sailed, in, the, searchthrift, to, try, to, reach, the, ob, river, but, he, was, stopped, by, ice, and, fog, at, the, entrance, to, the, kara, sea, not, until, 1580, did, another, english, expedition, under, arthur, pet, and, charles, jackman, attempt, its, passage, they, too, failed, to, penetrate, it, and, england, lost, interest, in, searching, for, the, northeast, passage, in, 1736, 1737, russian, admiral, stepan, malygin, undertook, a, voyage, from, dolgy, island, in, the, barents, sea, the, two, ships, in, this, early, expedition, were, the, perviy, under, malygin, s, command, and, the, vtoroy, under, captain, a, skuratov, after, entering, the, little, explored, kara, sea, they, sailed, to, the, mouth, of, the, ob, river, malygin, took, careful, observations, of, these, hitherto, almost, unknown, areas, of, the, russian, arctic, coastline, with, this, knowledge, he, was, able, to, draw, the, first, somewhat, accurate, map, of, the, arctic, shores, between, the, pechora, river, and, the, ob, river, in, 1878, finnish, explorer, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, on, ship, vega, sailed, across, the, kara, sea, from, gothenburg, along, the, coast, of, siberia, and, despite, the, ice, packs, got, to, 180, longitude, by, early, september, frozen, in, for, the, winter, in, the, chukchi, sea, nordenski, ld, waited, and, bartered, with, the, local, chukchi, people, the, following, july, the, vega, was, freed, from, the, ice, and, continued, to, yokohama, japan, he, became, the, first, to, force, the, northeast, passage, the, largest, group, of, islands, in, the, kara, sea, the, nordenski, ld, archipelago, has, been, named, in, his, honour, the, year, 1912, was, a, tragic, one, for, russian, explorers, in, the, kara, sea, in, that, fateful, year, unbroken, consolidated, ice, blocked, the, way, for, the, northern, sea, route, and, three, expeditions, that, had, to, cross, the, kara, sea, became, trapped, and, failed, sedov, s, on, vessel, st, foka, brusilov, s, on, the, st, anna, and, rusanov, s, on, the, gercules, georgy, sedov, intended, to, reach, franz, josef, land, on, ship, leave, a, depot, over, there, and, sledge, to, the, pole, due, to, the, heavy, ice, the, vessel, could, only, reach, novaya, zemlya, the, first, summer, and, wintered, in, franz, josef, land, in, february, 1914, sedov, headed, to, the, north, pole, with, two, sailors, and, three, sledges, but, he, fell, ill, and, died, on, rudolf, island, georgy, brusilov, attempted, to, navigate, the, northeast, passage, was, trapped, in, the, kara, sea, and, drifted, northward, for, more, than, two, years, reaching, latitude, 83, 17, n, thirteen, men, headed, by, valerian, albanov, left, the, vessel, and, started, across, the, ice, to, franz, josef, land, but, only, albanov, and, one, sailor, alexander, konrad, survived, after, a, gruesome, three, month, ordeal, the, survivors, brought, the, ship, log, of, st, anna, the, map, of, her, drift, and, daily, meteorological, records, but, the, destiny, of, those, who, stayed, on, board, remains, unknown, in, the, same, year, the, expedition, of, vladimir, rusanov, was, lost, in, the, kara, sea, the, prolonged, absence, of, those, three, expeditions, stirred, public, attention, and, a, few, small, rescue, expeditions, were, launched, including, jan, nag, rski, s, five, air, flights, over, the, sea, and, ice, from, the, nw, coast, of, novaya, zemlya, after, the, russian, revolution, in, 1917, the, scale, and, scope, of, exploration, of, the, kara, sea, increased, greatly, as, part, of, the, work, of, developing, the, northern, sea, route, polar, stations, of, which, five, already, existed, in, 1917, increased, in, number, providing, meteorologic, ice, reconnaissance, and, radio, facilities, by, 1932, there, were, 24, stations, by, 1948, about, 80, and, by, the, 1970s, more, than, 100, the, use, of, icebreakers, and, later, aircraft, as, platforms, for, scientific, work, were, developed, in, 1929, and, 1930, the, icebreaker, sedov, carried, groups, of, scientists, to, severnaya, zemlya, the, last, major, piece, of, unsurveyed, territory, in, the, soviet, arctic, the, archipelago, was, completely, mapped, under, georgy, ushakov, between, 1930, and, 1932, particularly, worth, noting, are, three, cruises, of, the, icebreaker, sadko, which, went, farther, north, than, most, in, 1935, and, 1936, the, last, unexplored, areas, in, the, northern, kara, sea, were, examined, and, the, small, and, elusive, ushakov, island, was, discovered, in, the, summer, of, 1942, german, kriegsmarine, warships, and, submarines, entered, the, kara, sea, to, destroy, as, many, russian, vessels, as, possible, this, naval, campaign, was, named, operation, wunderland, its, success, was, limited, by, the, presence, of, ice, floes, as, well, as, bad, weather, and, fog, these, effectively, protected, the, soviet, ships, preventing, the, damage, that, could, have, been, inflicted, on, the, soviet, fleet, under, fair, weather, conditions, in, october, 2010, the, russian, government, awarded, a, license, to, russian, oil, company, rosneft, for, developing, the, east, prinovozemelsky, oil, and, gas, structure, in, the, kara, sea, there, is, concern, about, radioactive, contamination, from, nuclear, waste, the, former, soviet, union, dumped, in, the, sea, and, the, effect, this, will, have, on, the, marine, environment, according, to, an, official, white, paper, report, compiled, and, released, by, the, russian, government, in, march, 1993, the, soviet, union, dumped, six, nuclear, submarine, reactors, and, ten, nuclear, reactors, into, the, kara, sea, between, 1965, and, 1988, solid, high, and, low, level, wastes, unloaded, from, northern, fleet, nuclear, submarines, during, reactor, refuelings, were, dumped, in, the, kara, sea, mainly, in, the, shallow, fjords, of, novaya, zemlya, where, the, depths, of, the, dumping, sites, range, from, 12, to, 135, meters, and, in, the, novaya, zemlya, trough, at, depths, of, up, to, 380, meters, liquid, low, level, wastes, were, released, in, the, open, barents, and, kara, seas, a, subsequent, appraisal, by, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, showed, that, releases, are, low, and, localized, from, the, 16, naval, reactors, reported, by, the, iaea, as, having, come, from, seven, submarines, and, the, icebreaker, lenin, which, were, dumped, at, five, sites, in, the, kara, sea, most, of, the, dumped, reactors, had, suffered, an, accident, the, soviet, submarine, k, 27, was, scuttled, in, stepovogo, bay, with, its, two, reactors, filled, with, spent, nuclear, fuel, at, a, seminar, in, february, 2012, it, was, revealed, that, the, reactors, on, board, the, submarine, could, re, achieve, criticality, and, explode, a, buildup, of, heat, leading, to, a, steam, explosion, vs, nuclear, the, catalogue, of, waste, dumped, at, sea, by, the, soviets, according, to, documents, seen, by, bellona, includes, some, 17, 000, containers, of, radioactive, waste, 19, ships, containing, radioactive, waste, 14, nuclear, reactors, including, five, that, still, contain, spent, nuclear, fuel, 735, other, pieces, of, radioactively, contaminated, heavy, machinery, and, the, k, 27, nuclear, submarine, with, its, two, reactors, loaded, with, nuclear, fuel, the, great, arctic, state, nature, reserve, the, largest, nature, reserve, of, russia, was, founded, on, 11, may, 1993, by, resolution, no, 431, of, the, government, of, the, russian, federation, rf, the, kara, sea, islands, section, 4, 000, km, 2, of, the, great, arctic, nature, reserve, includes, the, sergei, kirov, archipelago, the, voronina, island, the, izvestiy, tsik, islands, the, arctic, institute, islands, the, svordrup, island, uedineniya, ensomheden, and, a, number, of, smaller, islands, this, section, represents, rather, fully, the, natural, and, biological, diversity, of, arctic, sea, islands, of, the, eastern, part, of, the, kara, sea, nearby, the, franz, josef, land, and, severny, island, in, northern, novaya, zemlya, are, also, registered, as, a, sanctuary, the, russian, arctic, national, park
