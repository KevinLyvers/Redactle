moved, into, the, area, that, today, is, southern, namibia, their, encounters, with, the, nomadic, nama, tribes, were, largely, peaceful, they, received, the, missionaries, accompanying, the, oorlam, very, well, granting, them, the, right, to, use, waterholes, and, grazing, against, an, annual, payment, on, their, way, further, north, however, the, oorlam, encountered, clans, of, the, ovaherero, at, windhoek, gobabis, and, okahandja, who, resisted, their, encroachment, the, nama, herero, war, broke, out, in, 1880, with, hostilities, ebbing, only, after, the, german, empire, deployed, troops,

region, were, the, portuguese, navigators, diogo, c, o, in, 1485, and, bartolomeu, dias, in, 1486, but, the, portuguese, did, not, try, to, claim, the, area, like, most, of, the, interior, of, sub,

approximately, 65, 000, herero, about, 80, of, the, population, the, survivors, when, finally, released, from, detention, were, subjected, to, a, policy, of, dispossession, deportation, forced, labour, racial, segregation, and, discrimination, in, a, system, that, in, many, ways, foreshadowed, the, apartheid, established, by, south, africa, in, 1948, most, africans, were, confined, to, so, called, native, territories, which, under, south, african, rule, after, 1949, were, turned, into, homelands, bantustans, some, historians, have, speculated, that, the, downfall, of, the, herero, in, namibia, was, a, model, for, the, nazis, in, the, holocaust, the, memory, of, what, happened, under, german, rule, has, contributed, to, shape, the, ethnic, identity, in, independent, namibia, and, has, kept, its, significance, in, today, s, relations, with, germany, the, german, minister, for, development, aid, apologised, for, the, namibian, genocide, in, 2004, however, the, german, government, distanced, itself, from, this, apology, only, in, 2021, did, the, german, government, acknowledge, the, genocide, and, agreed, to, pay, 1, 1, billion, over, 30, years, in, community, aid,

of, versailles, resulted, in, south, west, africa, remaining, a, possession, of, south, africa, at, first, as, a, league, of, nations, mandate, until, 1990, the, mandate, system, was, formed, as, a, compromise, between, those, who, advocated, for, an, allied, annexation, of, former, german, and, ottoman, territories, and, a, proposition, put, forward, by, those, who, wished, to, grant, them, to, an, international, trusteeship, until, they, could, govern, themselves, it, permitted, the, south, african, government, to, administer, south, west, africa, until, that, territory, s, inhabitants, were, prepared, for, political, self, determination, south, africa, interpreted, the, mandate, as, a, veiled, annexation, and, made, no, attempt, to, prepare, south, west, africa, for, future, autonomy, as, a, result, of, the, conference, on, international, organization, in, 1945, the, league, of, nations, was, formally, superseded, by, the, united, nations, un, and, former, league, mandates, by, a, trusteeship, system, article, 77, of, the, united, nations, charter, stated, that, un, trusteeship, shall, apply, to, territories, now, held, under, mandate, furthermore, it, would, be, a, matter, of, subsequent, agreement, as, to, which, territories, in, the, foregoing, territories, will, be, brought, under, the, trusteeship, system, and, under, what, terms, the, un, requested, all, former, league, of, nations, mandates, be, surrendered, to, its, trusteeship, council, in, anticipation, of, their, independence, south, africa, declined, to, do, so, and, instead, requested, permission, from, the, un, to, formally, annex, south, west, africa, for, which, it, received, considerable, criticism, when, the, un, general, assembly, rejected, this, proposal, south, africa, dismissed, its, opinion, and, began, solidifying, control, of, the, territory, the, un, general, assembly, and, security, council, responded, by, referring, the, issue, to, the, international, court, of, justice, icj, which, held, a, number, of, discussions, on, the, legality, of, south, african, rule, between, 1949, and, 1966, south, africa, began, imposing, apartheid, its, codified, system, of, racial, segregation, and, discrimination, on, south, west, africa, during, the, late, 1940s, black, south, west, africans, were, subject, to, pass, laws, curfews, and, a, host, of, residential, regulations, that, restricted, their, movement, development, was, concentrated, in, the, southern, region, of, the, territory, adjacent, to, south, africa, known, as, the, police, zone, where, most, of, the, major, settlements, and, commercial, economic, activity, were, located, outside, the, police, zone, indigenous, peoples, were, restricted, to, theoretically, self, governing, tribal, homelands, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, accelerated, decolonisation, of, africa, and, mounting, pressure, on, the, remaining, colonial, powers, to, grant, their, colonies, self, determination, resulted, in, the, formation, of, nascent, nationalist, parties, in, south, west, africa, movements, such, as, the, south, west, african, national, union, swanu, and, the, south, west, african, people, s, organisation, swapo, advocated, for, the, formal, termination, of, south, africa, s, mandate, and, independence, for, the, territory, in, 1966, following, the, icj, s, controversial, ruling, that, it, had, no, legal, standing, to, consider, the, question, of, south, african, rule, swapo, launched, an, armed, insurgency, that, escalated, into, part, of, a, wider, regional, conflict, known, as, the, south, african, border, war, in, 1971, namibian, contract, workers, led, a, general, strike, against, the, contract, system, and, in, support, of, independence, some, of, the, striking, workers, would, later, join, swapo, s, plan, as, part, of, the, south, african, border, war, as, swapo, s, insurgency, intensified, south, africa, s, case, for, annexation, in, the, international, community, continued, to, decline, the, un, declared, that, south, africa, had, failed, in, its, obligations, to, ensure, the, moral, and, material, well, being, of, south, west, africa, s, indigenous, inhabitants, and, had, thus, disavowed, its, own, mandate, on, 12, june, 1968, the, un, general, assembly, adopted, a, resolution, proclaiming, that, in, accordance, with, the, desires, of, its, people, south, west, africa, be, renamed, namibia, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 269, adopted, in, august, 1969, declared, south, africa, s, continued,

several, flashpoints, for, cold, war, proxy, conflicts, in, southern, africa, during, the, latter, years, of, the, plan, insurgency, the, insurgents, sought, out, weapons, and, sent, recruits, to, the, soviet, union, for, military, training, as, the, plan, war, effort, gained, momentum, the, soviet, union, and, other, sympathetic, states, such, as, cuba, continued, to, increase, their, support,

war, rhetoric, in, south, africa, and, the, united, states, for, its, part, the, soviet, union, supported, swapo, partly, because, it, viewed, south, africa, as, a, regional, western, ally, growing, war, weariness, and, the, reduction, of, tensions, between, the, superpowers, compelled, south, africa, angola, and, cuba, to, accede, to, the, tripartite, accord, under, pressure, from, both, the,

be, extracted, in, the, future, according, to, the, diamond, investigation, a, book, about, the, global, diamond, market, from, 1978, de, beers, the, largest, diamond, company, bought, most, of, the, namibian, diamonds, and, would, continue, to, do, so, because, whatever, government, eventually, comes, to, power, they, will, need, this, revenue, to, survive, although, much, of, the, world, s, diamond, supply, comes, from, what, have, been, called, african, blood, diamonds, namibia, has, managed, to, develop, a, diamond, mining, industry, largely, free, of, the, kinds, of, conflict, extortion, and, murder, that, have, plagued, many, other, african, nations, with, diamond, mines, this, has, been, attributed, to, political, dynamics, economic, institutions, grievances, political, geography, and, the, effects, of, neighbourhoods, and, is, the, result, of, a, joint, agreement, between, the, government, and, de, beers, that, has, led, to, a, taxable, base, strengthening, state,

the, coastal, towns, of, swakopmund, walvis, bay, and, l, deritz, windhoek, plays, a, very, important, role, in, namibia, s, tourism, due, to, its, central, location, and, close, proximity, to, hosea,

independence, in, 1990, a, large, part, of, the, population, can, not, however, make, use, of, these, resources, due, to, the, prohibitively, high, consumption, cost, and, the, long, distance,
