3, 250, km, 2, 020, mi, or, 3, 380, km, 2, 100, mi, in, length, depending, on, the, measuring, party, and, their, methods, the, madeira, is, the, biggest, tributary, of, the, amazon, accounting, for, about, 15, of, the, water, in, the, basin, a, map, from, emanuel, bowen, in, 1747, held, by, the, david, rumsey, map, collection, refers, to, the, madeira, by, the, pre, colonial, indigenous, name, cuyari, the, river, of, cuyari, called, by, the, portuguese, madeira, or, the, wood, river, is, formed, by, two, great, rivers, which, join, near, its, mouth, it, was, by, this, river, that, the, nation, of, topinambes, passed, into, the, river, amazon, the, mean, inter, annual, precipitations, on, the, great, basins, vary, from, 75, to, 300, cm, 2, 5, 9, 8, ft, the, entire, upper, madeira, basin, receiving, 170, 5, cm, 5, 6, ft, the, greatest, extremes, of, rainfall, are, between, 49, and, 700, cm, 1, 6, 23, ft, even, just, below, the, confluence, that, forms, it, the, madeira, is, one, of, the, largest, rivers, of, the, world, with, a, mean, inter, annual, discharge, of, 18, 000, cubic, metres, per, second, 640, 000, cu, ft, s, i, e, 568, km, 3, 136, cu, mi, per, year, approximately, half, the, discharge, of, the, congo, river, on, the, further, course, towards, the, amazon, the, mean, discharge, of, the, madeira, increases, up, to, 31, 200, m, 3, s, 1, 100, 000,

the, whole, of, the, south, western, slope, of, brazilian, mato, grosso, and, the, northern, slope, of, the, chiquitos, sierras, in, total, this, catchment, area, which, is, slightly, more, than, the, combined, area, of, all, headwaters, is, 850, 000, km, 2, 330, 000, sq, mi, almost, equal, in, size, to, france, and, spain, combined, the, waters, flow, into, the, madeira, from, many, large, rivers, the, principal, of, which, from, east, to, west, are, the, guapor, or, it, nez, the, baures, and, blanco, the, itonamas, or, san, miguel, the, mamor, beni, and, madre, de, dios, or, mayutata, all, of, which, are, reinforced, by, numerous, secondary, but, powerful, affluents, the, climate, of, the, upper, catchment, area, varies, from, humid, in, the, western, edge, with, the, origin, of, the, river, s, main, stem, by, volume, r, o, madre, de, dios, r, o, beni, to, semi, arid, in, the, southernmost, part, with, the, andine, headwaters, of, the, main, stem, by, length, r, o, caine, r, o,

000, sq, mi, of, which, are, yearly, flooded, to, an, average, depth, of, about, one, meter, 3, ft, for, a, period, of, from, three, to, four, months, from, its, source, in, the, confluence, of, madre, de, dios, and, mamor, rivers, and, downstream, to, abuna, river, the, madeira, flows, northward, forming, border, between, bolivia, and, brazil, below, its, confluence, with, the, latter, tributary, the, flow, of, river, changes, to, north, eastward, direction, inland, of, rond, nia, state, of, brazil, the, section, of, the, river, from, the, border, to, porto, velho, has, notable, drop, of, bed, and, was, not, navigable, before, 2012, the, falls, of, teot, nio, and, of, san, ant, nio, existed, here, they, had, higher, flow, rate, and, bigger, level, drop, than, more, famous, boyoma, falls, in, africa, currently, these, rapids, are, submerged, by, the, reservoir, of, santo, ant, nio, dam, below, porto, velho, the, madeira, meanders, north, eastward, through, the, rond, nia, and, amazonas, states, of, north, west, brazil, to, its, junction, with, the, amazon, the, 283, 117, hectares, 2, 800, km, 2, 1, 100, sq, mi, rio, madeira, sustainable, development, reserve, created, in, 2006, extends, along, the, north, bank, of, the, river, opposite, the, town, of, novo, aripuan, at, its, mouth, is, ilha, tupinambaranas, an, extensive, marshy, region, formed, by, the, madeira, s, distributaries, the, madeira, river, rises, more, than, 15, m, 50, ft, during, the, rainy, season, and, ocean, vessels, may, ascend, it, to, the, falls, of, san, antonio, near, porto, velho, brazil, 1, 070, km, 660, mi, above, its, mouth, but, in, the, dry, months, from, june, to, november, it, is, only, navigable, for, the, same, distance, for, craft, drawing, about, 2, meters, 7,

shipping, from, the, atlantic, at, porto, velho, today, it, is, also, one, of, the, amazon, basin, s, most, active, waterways, and, helps, export, close, to, four, million, tons, of, grains, which, are, loaded, onto, barges, in, porto, velho, where, both, cargill, and, amaggi, have, loading, facilities, and, then, shipped, down, the, madeira, to, the, ports, of, itacoatiara, near, the, mouth, of, the, madeira, just, upstream, on, the, left, bank, of, the, amazon, or, further, down, the, amazon, to, the, port, of, santarem, at, the, mouth, of, the, tapajos, river, from, these, two, ports, panamax, type, ships, then, export, the, grains, mainly, soy, and, corn, to, europe, and, asia, the, madeira, waterway, is, also, used, to, take, fuel, from, the, reman, refinery, petrobras, in, manaus, state, capital, of, amazonas, to, porto, velho, from, where, the, states, of, acre, rond, nia, and, parts, of, mato, grosso, are, supplied, mainly, with, gasoline, petrol, refined, in, manaus, cargo, barges, also, use, the, madeira, on, the, route, between, manaus, and, porto, velho, which, is, 1, 225, km, 760, mi, along, the, rio, negro, amazon, and, madeira, connecting, manaus, industrial, district, with, the, rest, of, brazil, as, manaus, is, land, locked, as, far, as, logistics, with, the, rest, of, the, country, are, concerned, to, bring, in, part, of, its, raw, materials, and, export, its, produce, to, the, major, consumer, centres, of, s, o, paulo, and, rio, de, janeiro, in, 2012, the, cargo, amounted, to, 287, 835, tons, both, directions, the, total, tonnage, shipped, in, 2012, on, the, madeira, accounted, to, 5, 076, 014, two, large, dams, see, below, are, under, construction, as, part, of, the, iirsa, regional, integration, project, the, dam, projects, include, large, ship, locks, capable, of, moving, oceangoing, vessels, between, the, impounded, reservoir, and, the, downstream, river, if, the, project, is, completed, more, than, 4, 000, km, of, waterways, upstream, from, the, dams, in, brazil, bolivia, and, peru, would, become, navigable, as, typical, of, amazonian, rivers, with, the, primary, headwaters, in, the, andes, the, madeira, river, is, turbid, because, of, high, sediment, levels, and, it, is, whitewater, but, some, of, its, tributaries, are, clearwater, e, g, aripuan, and, ji, paran, or, blackwater, e, g, manicor, the, bolivian, river, dolphin, variously, considered, a, subspecies, of, the, amazon, river, dolphin, or, a, separate, species, is, restricted, to, the, upper, madeira, river, system, it, has, been, estimated, that, there, are, more, than, 900, fish, species, in, the, madeira, river, basin, making, it, one, of, the, freshwater, systems, in, the, world, with, the, highest, species, richness, the, river, is, the, fifth, title, of, the, 1993, 1999, philip, glass, album, aguas, da, amazonia, in, july, 2007, plans, have, been, approved, by, the, brazilian, government, to, construct, two, hydroelectric, dams, on, the, madeira, river, the, santo, ant, nio, dam, near, porto, velho, and, the, jirau, dam, about, 100, km, upstream, both, the, jirau, and, santo, antonio, dams, are, run, of, the, river, projects, that, do, not, impound, a, large, reservoir, both, dams, also, feature, some, environmental, re, mediation, efforts, such, as, fish, ladders, as, a, consequence, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, has, not, been, strong, environmental, opposition, to, the, implementation, of, the, madeira, river, complex, yet, if, the, fish, ladders, fail, several, valuable, migratory, fish, species, could, suffer, near, extinction, as, a, result, of, the, madeira, dams, there, are, also, concerns, with, deforestation, and, pressure, on, conservation, areas, and, indigenous, peoples, territories, the, worldwatch, institute, has, also, criticized, the, fast, track, approval, process, for, kindler, gentler, dams, with, smaller, reservoirs, designed, to, lessen, social, and, environmental, impacts, claiming, that, no, project, should, fast, track, the, licensing, of, new, dams, in, amazonia, and, allow, projects, to, circumvent, brazil, s, tough,
