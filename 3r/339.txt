the, cerrado, portuguese, pronunciation, is, a, vast, ecoregion, of, tropical, savanna, in, eastern, brazil, being, present, in, the, states, of, goi, s, mato, grosso, do, sul, mato, grosso, tocantins, maranh, o, piau, bahia, minas, gerais, s, o, paulo, paran, and, the, federal, district, the, core, areas, of, the, cerrado, biome, are, the, brazilian, highlands, the, planalto, the, main, habitat, types, of, the, cerrado, consist, of, forest, savanna, wooded, savanna, park, savanna, and, gramineous, woody, savanna, the, cerrado, also, includes, savanna, wetlands, and, gallery, forests, the, second, largest, of, brazil, s, major, habitat, types, after, the, amazonian, rainforest, the, cerrado, accounts, for, a, full, 21, percent, of, the, country, s, land, area, extending, marginally, into, paraguay, and, bolivia, about, 75, of, the, cerrado, s, 2, million, km, 2, is, privately, owned, vast, amounts, of, research, have, shown, that, the, cerrado, is, one, of, the, richest, of, all, tropical, savanna, regions, and, has, high, levels, of, endemism, characterizing, it, by, its, enormous, ranges, of, plant, and, animal, biodiversity, world, wide, fund, for, nature, named, the, cerrado, the, biologically, richest, savanna, in, the, world, with, about, 10, 000, plant, species, and, 10, endemic, bird, species, there, are, nearly, 200, species, of, mammal, in, the, cerrado, though, only, 14, are, endemic, the, large, fraction, of, private, ownership, makes, protection, difficult, though, the, cerrado, s, climate, is, typical, of, the, wetter, savanna, regions, of, the, world, with, a, semi, humid, tropical, climate, the, cerrado, is, limited, to, two, dominant, seasons, throughout, the, year, wet, and, dry, annual, temperatures, for, the, cerrado, average, between, 22, and, 27, c, and, average, precipitation, between, 80, 200, cm, for, over, 90, of, the, area, this, ecoregion, has, a, very, strong, dry, season, during, the, southern, winter, approx, april, september, the, cerrado, is, characterized, by, unique, vegetation, types, it, is, composed, of, a, shifting, mosaic, of, habitats, with, the, savanna, like, cerrado, itself, on, well, drained, areas, between, strips, of, gallery, forest, closed, canopy, tall, forest, which, occur, along, streams, between, the, cerrado, and, the, gallery, forest, is, an, area, of, vegetation, known, as, the, wet, campo, with, distinct, up, and, downslope, borders, where, tree, growth, is, inhibited, due, to, wide, seasonal, fluctuations, in, the, water, table, the, savanna, portion, of, the, cerrado, is, heterogeneous, in, terms, of, canopy, cover, goodland, 1971, divided, the, cerrado, into, four, categories, ranging, from, least, to, most, canopy, cover, campo, sujo, herbaceous, layer, with, occasional, small, trees, about, 3, m, tall, campo, cerrado, slightly, higher, density, of, trees, about, 4, m, tall, on, average, cerrado, sensu, stricto, orchard, like, vegetation, with, trees, about, 6, m, high, and, cerrad, o, canopy, cover, near, 50, with, general, height, 9, m, probably, around, 800, species, of, trees, are, found, in, the, cerrado, among, the, most, diverse, families, of, trees, in, the, cerrado, are, the, leguminosae, 153, spp, malpighiaceae, 46, myrtaceae, 43, melastomataceae, 32, and, rubiaceae, 30, much, of, the, cerrado, is, dominated, by, the, vochysiaceae, 23, species, in, the, cerrado, due, to, the, abundance, of, three, species, in, the, genus, qualea, the, herbaceous, layer, usually, reaches, about, 60, cm, in, height, and, is, composed, mainly, of, the, poaceae, cyperaceae, leguminosae, compositae, myrtaceae, and, rubiaceae, much, of, the, vegetation, in, the, gallery, forests, is, similar, to, nearby, rainforest, however, there, are, some, endemic, species, found, only, in, the, cerrado, gallery, forests, soil, fertility, fire, regime, and, hydrology, are, thought, to, be, most, influential, in, determining, cerrado, vegetation, cerrado, soils, are, always, well, drained, and, most, are, oxisols, with, low, ph, and, low, calcium, and, magnesium, the, amount, of, potassium, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, has, been, found, to, be, positively, correlated, with, tree, trunk, basal, area, in, cerrado, habitats, much, as, in, other, grasslands, and, savannas, fire, is, important, in, maintaining, and, shaping, the, cerrado, s, landscape, many, plants, in, the, cerrado, are, fire, adapted, exhibiting, characters, like, thick, corky, bark, to, withstand, the, heat, cerrado, vegetation, is, believed, to, be, ancient, stretching, back, perhaps, as, far, in, a, prototypic, form, as, the, cretaceous, before, africa, and, south, america, separated, a, dynamic, expansion, and, contraction, between, cerrado, and, amazonian, rainforest, has, probably, occurred, historically, with, expansion, of, the, cerrado, during, glacial, periods, like, the, pleistocene, these, processes, and, the, resulting, fragmentation, in, multiple, refugia, have, probably, contributed, to, the, high, species, richness, both, of, the, cerrado, and, of, the, amazonian, rainforest, the, cerrado, has, a, high, diversity, of, vertebrates, with, 150, amphibian, species, 120, reptile, species, 837, bird, species, and, 161, mammal, species, recorded, lizard, diversity, is, generally, thought, to, be, relatively, low, in, the, cerrado, compared, to, other, areas, like, caatinga, or, lowland, rainforest, although, one, recent, study, found, 57, species, in, one, cerrado, area, with, the, high, diversity, driven, by, the, availability, of, open, habitat, ameiva, ameiva, is, among, the, largest, lizards, found, in, the, cerrado, and, is, the, most, important, lizard, predator, where, it, is, found, in, the, cerrado, there, is, a, relatively, high, diversity, of, snakes, in, the, cerrado, 22, 61, species, depending, on, site, with, colubridae, being, the, richest, family, the, open, nature, of, the, cerrado, vegetation, most, likely, contributes, to, the, high, diversity, of, snakes, information, about, cerrado, amphibians, is, extremely, limited, although, the, cerrado, probably, has, a, unique, assemblage, of, species, with, some, endemic, to, the, region, most, birds, found, in, the, cerrado, breed, there, although, there, are, some, austral, migrants, breed, in, temperate, south, america, and, winter, in, the, amazon, basin, and, nearctic, migrants, breed, in, temperate, north, america, and, winter, in, the, neotropics, that, pass, through, most, breeding, birds, in, the, cerrado, are, found, in, more, closed, canopy, areas, like, gallery, forests, although, 27, of, the, birds, breed, only, in, open, habitats, and, 21, breed, in, either, open, or, closed, habitats, many, of, the, birds, in, the, cerrado, especially, those, found, in, closed, forest, are, related, to, species, from, the, atlantic, rainforest, and, also, the, amazon, rainforest, the, crowned, solitary, eagle, hyacinth, macaw, toco, toucan, buff, necked, ibis, dwarf, tinamou, and, brazilian, merganser, are, examples, of, birds, found, in, the, cerrado, gallery, forests, serve, as, primary, habitat, for, most, of, the, mammals, in, the, cerrado, having, more, water, being, protected, from, fires, that, sweep, the, landscape, and, having, a, more, highly, structured, habitat, eleven, mammal, species, are, endemic, to, the, cerrado, notable, species, include, large, herbivores, like, the, brazilian, tapir, and, pampas, deer, and, large, predators, like, the, maned, wolf, cougar, jaguar, giant, otter, ocelot, and, jaguarundi, although, the, diversity, is, much, lower, than, in, the, adjacent, amazon, and, atlantic, forest, several, species, of, monkeys, are, present, including, black, striped, capuchin, black, howler, monkey, and, black, tufted, marmoset, the, insects, of, the, cerrado, are, relatively, understudied, a, yearlong, survey, of, the, cerrado, at, one, reserve, in, brazil, found, that, the, orders, coleoptera, hymenoptera, diptera, and, isoptera, accounted, for, 89, 5, of, all, captures, the, cerrado, also, supports, a, high, density, up, to, 4000, per, hectare, of, the, nests, of, leaf, cutter, ants, sa, vas, which, are, also, very, diverse, along, with, termites, leaf, cutter, ants, are, the, primary, herbivores, of, the, cerrado, and, play, an, important, role, in, consuming, and, decomposing, organic, matter, as, well, as, constituting, an, important, food, source, to, many, other, animal, species, the, highest, diversity, of, galling, insects, insects, that, build, galls, in, the, world, is, also, found, in, the, cerrado, with, the, most, species, 46, found, at, the, base, of, the, serra, do, cip, in, southeast, brazil, the, first, detailed, european, account, of, the, brazilian, cerrados, was, provided, by, danish, botanist, eugenius, warming, 1892, in, the, book, lagoa, santa, in, which, he, describes, the, main, features, of, the, cerrado, vegetation, in, the, state, of, minas, gerais, taking, advantage, of, the, sprouting, of, the, herbaceous, stratum, that, follows, a, burning, in, the, cerrado, the, aboriginal, inhabitants, of, these, regions, learned, to, use, the, fire, as, a, tool, to, increase, the, fodder, to, offer, to, their, domesticated, animals, xavantes, tapuias, karaj, s, av, canoeiros, krah, s, xerentes, xacriab, s, were, some, of, the, first, indigenous, peoples, occupying, different, regions, in, the, cerrado, many, groups, among, the, indigenous, were, nomads, and, explored, the, cerrado, by, hunting, and, collecting, others, practiced, coivara, agriculture, an, itinerant, type, of, slash, and, burn, agriculture, the, mixing, of, indigenous, quilombola, maroon, communities, extractivists, geraizeiros, living, in, the, drier, regions, riverbank, dwellers, and, vazanteiros, living, on, floodplains, shaped, a, diverse, local, population, that, relies, heavily, on, the, resources, of, their, environment, until, the, mid, 1960s, agricultural, activities, in, the, cerrado, were, very, limited, since, natural, cerrado, soils, are, not, fertile, enough, for, crop, production, directed, mainly, at, the, extensive, production, of, beef, cattle, for, subsistence, of, the, local, market, after, this, period, however, the, urban, and, industrial, development, of, the, southeast, region, has, forced, agriculture, to, the, central, west, region, the, transfer, of, the, country, s, capital, to, bras, lia, has, been, another, focus, of, attraction, of, population, to, the, central, region, from, 1975, until, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, many, governmental, subsidy, programs, were, launched, to, promote, agriculture, with, the, intent, of, stimulating, the, development, of, the, cerrado, region, as, a, result, there, has, been, a, significant, increase, in, agricultural, and, cattle, production, on, the, other, hand, the, urban, pressure, and, the, rapid, establishment, of, agricultural, activities, in, the, region, have, been, rapidly, reducing, the, biodiversity, of, the, ecosystems, and, the, population, in, the, cerrado, region, more, than, doubled, from, 1970, to, 2010, going, from, 35, 8, to, 76, million, the, cerrado, was, thought, challenging, for, agriculture, until, researchers, at, brazil, s, agricultural, and, livestock, research, agency, embrapa, discovered, that, it, could, be, made, fit, for, industrial, crops, by, appropriate, additions, of, phosphorus, and, lime, in, the, late, 1990s, between, 14, million, and, 16, million, tons, of, lime, were, being, poured, on, brazilian, fields, each, year, the, quantity, rose, to, 25, million, tons, in, 2003, and, 2004, equaling, around, five, tons, of, lime, per, hectare, this, manipulation, of, the, soil, allowed, for, industrial, agriculture, to, grow, exponentially, in, the, area, researchers, also, developed, tropical, varieties, of, soybeans, until, then, a, temperate, crop, and, currently, brazil, is, the, world, s, main, soyabeans, exporter, due, to, the, boom, in, animal, feed, production, caused, by, the, global, rise, in, meat, demand, today, the, cerrado, region, provides, more, than, 70, of, the, beef, cattle, production, in, the, country, being, also, a, major, production, center, of, grains, mainly, soya, beans, maize, and, rice, large, extensions, of, the, cerrado, are, also, used, for, the, production, of, cellulose, pulp, for, the, paper, industry, with, the, cultivation, of, several, species, of, eucalyptus, and, pines, but, as, a, secondary, activity, coffee, produced, in, the, cerrado, is, now, a, major, export, charcoal, production, for, brazil, s, steel, industry, comes, in, second, to, agriculture, in, the, cerrado, they, actually, are, quite, intertwined, when, land, is, being, cleared, to, make, more, land, for, agriculture, the, tree, s, trunks, and, roots, are, often, used, in, the, production, of, charcoal, helping, to, make, money, for, the, clearing, the, brazilian, steel, industry, has, traditionally, always, used, the, trunks, and, roots, from, the, cerrado, for, charcoal, but, now, that, the, steel, mills, in, the, state, of, minas, gerais, are, among, the, world, s, largest, it, has, taken, a, much, higher, toll, on, the, cerrado, however, recently, because, of, the, conservation, efforts, and, the, diminishing, vegetation, in, the, cerrado, they, now, are, receiving, some, charcoal, from, the, eucalyptus, plantations, and, these, efforts, are, growing, the, cerrado, biome, is, strategic, for, the, water, resources, of, brazil, the, biome, contains, the, headwaters, and, the, largest, portion, of, south, american, watersheds, the, paran, paraguay, araguaia, tocantins, and, s, o, francisco, river, basins, and, the, upper, catchments, of, large, amazon, tributaries, such, as, the, xingu, and, tapaj, s, during, the, last, four, decades, the, cerrado, s, river, basins, have, been, highly, impacted, by, extreme, deforestation, expansion, of, the, agricultural, and, cattle, ranching, frontier, construction, of, dams, and, extraction, of, water, for, irrigation, the, cerrado, is, the, second, largest, biome, in, south, america, and, the, most, biodiverse, savanna, in, the, world, however, it, is, not, currently, recognized, by, the, brazilian, constitution, as, a, national, heritage, it, is, also, home, to, the, guarani, aquifer, stores, the, largest, fresh, water, underground, reservoirs, in, south, america, and, supplies, water, to, a, third, of, the, amazon, river, and, the, largest, basins, in, the, continent, brazilian, agriculturalists, and, ministers, regard, it, as, having, no, conservation, value, and, the, government, has, protected, merely, 1, 5, of, the, cerrado, biome, in, federal, reserves, by, 1994, an, estimated, 695, 000, km, 2, of, cerrado, representing, 35, of, its, area, had, been, converted, to, anthropic, landscape, in, total, 37, 3, of, the, cerrado, has, already, been, totally, converted, to, human, use, while, an, additional, 41, 4, is, used, for, pasture, and, charcoal, production, the, gallery, forests, in, the, region, have, been, among, the, most, heavily, affected, it, is, estimated, that, only, about, 432, 814, km, 2, or, 21, 3, of, the, original, vegetation, remains, intact, today, during, the, last, 25, years, this, biome, has, been, increasingly, threatened, by, industrial, monoculture, farming, particularly, soybeans, the, unregulated, expansion, of, industrial, agriculture, the, burning, of, vegetation, for, charcoal, and, the, development, of, dams, to, provide, irrigation, are, drawing, criticisms, and, have, been, identified, as, potential, threats, to, several, brazilian, rivers, this, industrial, farming, of, the, cerrado, with, the, clearing, of, land, for, eucalyptus, and, soy, plantations, has, grown, so, much, because, of, various, forms, of, subsidy, including, very, generous, tax, incentives, and, low, interest, loans, this, has, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, a, highly, mechanized, capital, intensive, system, of, agriculture, there, is, also, a, strong, agribusiness, lobby, in, brazil, and, in, particular, the, production, of, soybeans, in, the, cerrado, is, influenced, by, large, corporations, such, as, adm, cargill, and, bunge, these, latter, two, directly, associated, with, the, mass, deforestation, of, this, biome, one, issue, with, expanding, this, reserve, is, that, research, needs, to, be, done, to, choose, the, location, of, these, reserves, because, the, cerrado, biome, is, floristically, very, heterogeneous, and, constitutes, a, biological, mosaic, teams, from, the, university, of, bras, lia, cpac, and, the, royal, botanic, garden, edinburgh, have, been, collaborating, on, this, project, for, a, number, of, years, supported, by, brazilian, european, community, and, british, funds, the, project, has, recently, been, expanded, into, a, major, anglo, brazilian, initiative, conservation, and, management, of, the, biodiversity, of, the, cerrado, biome, with, uk, overseas, development, administration, funding, its, aim, is, to, survey, the, floristic, patterns, of, cerrado, vegetation, and, to, discover, representative, areas, and, biodiversity, hot, spots, a, 2017, assessment, found, that, 433, 581, km, 2, or, 23, of, the, ecoregion, is, in, protected, areas, protected, areas, in, brazil, include, as, well, as, in, bolivia
