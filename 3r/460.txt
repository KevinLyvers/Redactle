madagascar, officially, the, republic, of, madagascar, is, an, island, country, comprising, the, island, of, madagascar, and, numerous, smaller, peripheral, islands, lying, off, the, southeastern, coast, of, africa, it, is, the, world, s, fourth, largest, island, the, second, largest, island, country, and, the, 46th, largest, country, in, the, world, its, capital, and, largest, city, is, antananarivo, following, the, prehistoric, breakup, of, the, supercontinent, gondwana, madagascar, split, from, africa, during, the, early, jurassic, around, 180, million, years, ago, and, split, from, the, indian, subcontinent, around, 90, million, years, ago, allowing, native, plants, and, animals, to, evolve, in, relative, isolation, consequently, it, is, a, biodiversity, hotspot, and, one, of, the, world, s, 17, megadiverse, countries, with, over, 90, of, wildlife, being, endemic, the, island, has, a, subtropical, to, tropical, maritime, climate, madagascar, was, first, settled, during, or, before, the, mid, first, millennium, ad, by, austronesian, peoples, presumably, arriving, on, outrigger, canoes, from, present, day, indonesia, these, were, joined, around, the, ninth, century, ad, by, bantu, migrants, crossing, the, mozambique, channel, from, east, africa, other, groups, continued, to, settle, on, madagascar, over, time, each, one, making, lasting, contributions, to, malagasy, cultural, life, consequently, there, are, 18, or, more, classified, peoples, of, madagascar, the, most, numerous, being, the, merina, of, the, central, highlands, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, island, of, madagascar, was, ruled, by, a, fragmented, assortment, of, shifting, sociopolitical, alliances, beginning, in, the, early, 19th, century, most, of, it, was, united, and, ruled, as, the, kingdom, of, madagascar, by, a, series, of, merina, nobles, the, monarchy, was, ended, in, 1897, by, the, annexation, by, france, from, which, madagascar, gained, independence, in, 1960, the, country, has, since, undergone, four, major, constitutional, periods, termed, republics, and, has, been, governed, as, a, constitutional, democracy, since, 1992, following, a, political, crisis, and, military, coup, in, 2009, madagascar, underwent, a, protracted, transition, towards, its, fourth, and, current, republic, with, constitutional, governance, being, restored, in, january, 2014, madagascar, is, a, member, of, the, united, nations, un, the, african, union, au, the, southern, african, development, community, sadc, and, the, organisation, internationale, de, la, francophonie, malagasy, and, french, are, both, official, languages, of, the, state, christianity, is, the, country, s, predominant, religion, with, a, significant, minority, still, practising, traditional, faiths, madagascar, is, classified, as, a, least, developed, country, by, the, un, ecotourism, and, agriculture, paired, with, greater, investments, in, education, health, and, private, enterprise, are, key, elements, of, its, development, strategy, despite, substantial, economic, growth, since, the, early, 2000s, income, disparities, have, widened, and, quality, of, life, remains, low, for, the, majority, of, the, population, as, of, 2021, 68, 4, percent, of, the, population, is, considered, to, be, multidimensionally, poor, in, the, malagasy, language, the, island, of, madagascar, is, called, madagasikara, malagasy, pronunciation, and, its, people, are, referred, to, as, malagasy, the, origin, of, the, name, is, uncertain, and, is, likely, foreign, having, been, propagated, in, the, middle, ages, by, europeans, if, this, is, the, case, it, is, unknown, when, the, name, was, adopted, by, the, inhabitants, of, the, island, no, single, malagasy, language, name, predating, madagasikara, appears, to, have, been, used, by, the, local, population, to, refer, to, the, island, although, some, communities, had, their, name, for, part, or, all, of, the, lands, they, inhabited, one, hypothesis, relates, madagascar, to, the, word, malay, referring, to, the, austronesian, origin, of, the, malagasy, people, in, modern, day, indonesia, in, a, map, by, muhammad, al, idrisi, dating, from, the, year, 1154, the, island, is, named, gesira, malai, or, malay, island, in, arabic, the, inversion, of, this, name, to, malai, gesira, as, it, was, known, by, the, greeks, is, thought, to, be, the, precursor, of, the, modern, name, of, the, island, the, name, malay, island, was, later, rendered, in, latin, as, malichu, an, abbreviated, form, of, malai, insula, in, the, medieval, hereford, mappa, mundi, as, the, name, of, madagascar, another, hypothesis, is, that, madagascar, is, a, corrupted, transliteration, of, mogadishu, the, capital, of, somalia, and, an, important, medieval, indian, ocean, port, this, would, have, resulted, from, 13th, century, venetian, explorer, marco, polo, confusing, the, two, locations, in, his, memoirs, in, which, he, mentions, the, land, of, madageiscar, to, the, south, of, socotra, this, name, would, then, have, been, popularized, on, renaissance, maps, by, europeans, one, of, the, first, documents, written, that, might, explain, why, marco, polo, called, it, madagascar, is, in, a, 1609, book, on, madagascar, by, jerome, megiser, jerome, megiser, describes, an, event, in, which, the, kings, of, mogadishu, and, adal, traveled, to, madagascar, with, a, fleet, of, around, twenty, five, thousand, men, in, order, to, invade, the, wealthy, islands, of, taprobane, and, sumatra, however, a, tempest, threw, them, off, course, and, they, landed, on, the, coasts, of, madagascar, conquering, the, island, and, signing, a, treaty, with, its, inhabitants, they, remained, for, eight, months, and, erected, at, different, points, of, the, island, eight, pillars, on, which, they, engraved, magadoxo, a, name, which, later, by, corruption, became, madagascar, jan, huyghen, van, linschoten, a, dutch, traveler, who, copied, portuguese, works, and, maps, confirmed, this, event, by, saying, madagascar, has, its, name, from, makdishu, mogadishu, whose, shayk, invaded, it, the, name, malagasikara, or, malagascar, is, also, historically, attested, a, british, state, paper, in, 1699, records, the, arrival, of, eighty, to, ninety, passengers, from, malagaskar, to, what, would, eventually, become, new, york, city, an, 1882, edition, of, the, british, newspaper, the, graphic, referred, to, malagascar, as, the, name, of, the, island, stating, that, it, is, etymologically, a, word, of, malay, origin, and, may, be, related, to, the, name, of, malacca, in, 1891, saleh, bin, osman, a, zanzibari, traveler, refers, to, the, island, as, malagaskar, when, recounting, his, journeys, including, as, part, of, the, emin, pasha, relief, expedition, in, 1905, charles, basset, wrote, in, his, doctoral, thesis, that, malagasikara, was, the, way, the, island, is, referred, to, by, its, natives, who, emphasized, that, they, were, malagasy, and, not, madagasy, traditionally, archaeologists, have, estimated, that, the, earliest, settlers, arrived, in, successive, waves, in, outrigger, canoes, from, south, borneo, possibly, throughout, the, period, between, 350, bc, and, 550, ad, while, others, are, cautious, about, dates, earlier, than, ad, 250, in, either, case, these, dates, make, madagascar, one, of, the, most, recent, major, landmasses, on, earth, to, be, settled, by, humans, predating, the, settlement, of, iceland, and, new, zealand, it, is, proposed, that, ma, anyan, people, were, brought, as, laborers, and, slaves, by, javan, and, sumatran, malays, in, their, trading, fleets, to, madagascar, dates, earlier, than, the, mid, first, millennium, ad, are, not, strongly, supported, upon, arrival, early, settlers, practiced, slash, and, burn, agriculture, to, clear, the, coastal, rainforests, for, cultivation, the, first, settlers, encountered, madagascar, s, abundance, of, megafauna, including, 17, species, of, giant, lemurs, the, large, flightless, elephant, birds, including, possibly, the, largest, bird, to, ever, exist, aepyornis, maximus, the, giant, fossa, and, several, species, of, malagasy, hippopotamus, which, have, since, become, extinct, because, of, hunting, and, habitat, destruction, by, 600, ad, groups, of, these, early, settlers, had, begun, clearing, the, forests, of, the, central, highlands, arab, traders, first, reached, the, island, between, the, 7th, and, 9th, centuries, a, wave, of, bantu, speaking, migrants, from, southeastern, africa, arrived, around, the, year, 1000, around, this, time, zebu, from, south, india, were, first, brought, intermingling, with, sanga, found, in, east, africa, irrigated, paddy, fields, were, developed, in, the, central, highland, betsileo, kingdom, and, were, extended, with, terraced, paddies, throughout, the, neighboring, kingdom, of, imerina, a, century, later, the, rising, intensity, of, land, cultivation, and, the, ever, increasing, demand, for, zebu, pasturage, had, largely, transformed, the, central, highlands, from, a, forest, ecosystem, to, grassland, by, the, 17th, century, the, oral, histories, of, the, merina, people, who, arrived, in, the, central, highlands, between, 600, and, 1, 000, years, ago, describe, encountering, an, established, population, they, called, the, vazimba, probably, the, descendants, of, an, earlier, and, less, technologically, advanced, austronesian, settlement, wave, the, vazimba, were, assimilated, or, expelled, from, the, highlands, by, the, merina, kings, andriamanelo, ralambo, and, andrianjaka, in, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, today, the, spirits, of, the, vazimba, are, revered, as, tompontany, ancestral, masters, of, the, land, by, many, traditional, malagasy, communities, the, written, history, of, madagascar, began, with, the, arabs, who, established, trading, posts, along, the, northwest, coast, by, at, least, the, 10th, century, and, introduced, islam, the, arabic, script, used, to, transcribe, the, malagasy, language, in, a, form, of, writing, known, as, sorabe, arab, astrology, and, other, cultural, elements, european, contact, began, in, 1500, when, the, portuguese, sea, captain, diogo, dias, sighted, the, island, while, participating, in, the, 2nd, armada, of, the, portuguese, india, armadas, matatana, was, the, first, portuguese, settlement, on, the, south, coast, 10, km, west, of, fort, dauphin, in, 1508, settlers, there, built, a, tower, a, small, village, and, a, stone, column, this, settlement, was, established, in, 1513, at, the, behest, of, the, viceroy, of, portuguese, india, jeronimo, de, azevedo, contacts, continued, from, the, 1550s, several, colonization, and, conversion, missions, were, ordered, by, king, jo, o, iii, and, by, the, viceroy, of, india, including, one, in, 1553, by, baltazar, lobo, de, sousa, in, that, mission, according, to, detailed, descriptions, by, chroniclers, diogo, do, couto, and, jo, o, de, barros, emissaries, reached, the, inland, via, rivers, and, bays, exchanging, goods, and, even, converting, one, of, the, local, kings, the, french, established, trading, posts, along, the, east, coast, in, the, late, 17th, century, from, about, 1774, to, 1824, madagascar, gained, prominence, among, pirates, and, european, traders, particularly, those, involved, in, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, the, small, island, of, nosy, boroha, off, the, northeastern, coast, of, madagascar, has, been, proposed, by, some, historians, as, the, site, of, the, legendary, pirate, utopia, of, libertalia, many, european, sailors, were, shipwrecked, on, the, coasts, of, the, island, among, them, robert, drury, whose, journal, is, one, of, the, few, written, depictions, of, life, in, southern, madagascar, during, the, 18th, century, european, accounts, until, the, early, 20th, century, identified, malagasy, people, as, being, of, jewish, origin, the, wealth, generated, by, maritime, trade, spurred, the, rise, of, organized, kingdoms, on, the, island, some, of, which, had, grown, quite, powerful, by, the, 17th, century, among, these, were, the, betsimisaraka, alliance, of, the, eastern, coast, and, the, sakalava, chiefdoms, of, menabe, and, boina, on, the, west, coast, the, kingdom, of, imerina, located, in, the, central, highlands, with, its, capital, at, the, royal, palace, of, antananarivo, emerged, at, around, the, same, time, under, the, leadership, of, king, andriamanelo, upon, its, emergence, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, highland, kingdom, of, imerina, was, initially, a, minor, power, relative, to, the, larger, coastal, kingdoms, and, grew, even, weaker, in, the, early, 18th, century, when, king, andriamasinavalona, divided, it, among, his, four, sons, following, almost, a, century, of, warring, and, famine, imerina, was, reunited, in, 1793, by, king, andrianampoinimerina, 1787, 1810, from, his, initial, capital, ambohimanga, and, later, from, the, rova, of, antananarivo, this, merina, king, rapidly, expanded, his, rule, over, neighbouring, principalities, his, ambition, to, bring, the, entire, island, under, his, control, was, largely, achieved, by, his, son, and, successor, king, radama, i, 1810, 28, who, was, recognized, by, the, british, government, as, king, of, madagascar, radama, concluded, a, treaty, in, 1817, with, the, british, governor, of, mauritius, to, abolish, the, lucrative, slave, trade, in, return, for, british, military, and, financial, assistance, artisan, missionary, envoys, from, the, london, missionary, society, began, arriving, in, 1818, and, included, such, key, figures, as, james, cameron, david, jones, and, david, griffiths, who, established, schools, transcribed, the, malagasy, language, using, the, roman, alphabet, translated, the, bible, and, introduced, a, variety, of, new, technologies, to, the, island, radama, s, successor, queen, ranavalona, i, 1828, 61, responded, to, increasing, political, and, cultural, encroachment, on, the, part, of, britain, and, france, by, issuing, a, royal, edict, prohibiting, the, practice, of, christianity, in, madagascar, and, pressuring, most, foreigners, to, leave, the, territory, william, ellis, of, the, london, missionary, society, described, his, visits, made, during, her, reign, in, his, book, three, visits, to, madagascar, during, the, years, 1853, 1854, and, 1856, the, queen, made, heavy, use, of, the, traditional, practice, of, fanompoana, forced, labor, as, tax, payment, to, complete, public, works, projects, and, develop, a, standing, army, of, between, 20, 000, and, 30, 000, merina, soldiers, whom, she, deployed, to, pacify, outlying, regions, of, the, island, and, further, expand, the, kingdom, of, merina, to, encompass, most, of, madagascar, residents, of, madagascar, could, accuse, one, another, of, various, crimes, including, theft, christianity, and, especially, witchcraft, for, which, the, ordeal, of, tangena, was, routinely, obligatory, between, 1828, and, 1861, the, tangena, ordeal, caused, about, 3, 000, deaths, annually, in, 1838, it, was, estimated, that, as, many, as, 100, 000, people, in, imerina, died, as, a, result, of, the, tangena, ordeal, constituting, roughly, 20, percent, of, the, population, the, combination, of, regular, warfare, disease, difficult, forced, labor, and, harsh, measures, of, justice, resulted, in, a, high, mortality, rate, among, soldiers, and, civilians, alike, during, her, 33, year, reign, the, population, of, madagascar, is, estimated, to, have, declined, from, around, 5, million, to, 2, 5, million, between, 1833, and, 1839, among, those, who, continued, to, reside, in, imerina, were, jean, laborde, an, entrepreneur, who, developed, munitions, and, other, industries, on, behalf, of, the, monarchy, and, joseph, fran, ois, lambert, a, french, adventurer, and, slave, trader, with, whom, then, prince, radama, ii, signed, a, controversial, trade, agreement, termed, the, lambert, charter, succeeding, his, mother, radama, ii, attempted, to, relax, the, queen, s, stringent, policies, but, was, overthrown, two, years, later, by, prime, minister, rainivoninahitriniony, and, an, alliance, of, andriana, noble, and, hova, commoner, courtiers, who, sought, to, end, the, absolute, power, of, the, monarch, following, the, coup, the, courtiers, offered, radama, s, queen, rasoherina, the, opportunity, to, rule, if, she, would, accept, a, power, sharing, arrangement, with, the, prime, minister, a, new, social, contract, that, would, be, sealed, by, a, political, marriage, between, them, queen, rasoherina, accepted, first, marrying, rainivoninahitriniony, then, later, deposing, him, and, marrying, his, brother, prime, minister, rainilaiarivony, who, would, go, on, to, marry, queen, ranavalona, ii, and, queen, ranavalona, iii, in, succession, over, the, course, of,
