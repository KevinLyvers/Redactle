mont, blanc, bre, m, b, l, k, ame, m, n, t, b, l, k, is, the, highest, mountain, in, the, alps, and, western, europe, and, the, highest, mountain, in, europe, outside, the, caucasus, mountains, rising, 4, 805, 59, m, 15, 766, ft, above, sea, level, located, on, the, franco, italian, border, it, is, the, second, most, prominent, mountain, in, europe, after, mount, elbrus, and, the, 11th, most, prominent, mountain, in, the, world, it, gives, its, name, to, the, mont, blanc, massif, which, straddles, parts, of, france, italy, and, switzerland, mont, blanc, s, summit, lies, on, the, watershed, line, between, the, valleys, of, ferret, and, veny, in, italy, and, the, valleys, of, montjoie, and, arve, in, france, ownership, of, the, summit, area, has, long, been, disputed, between, france, and, italy, the, mont, blanc, massif, is, popular, for, outdoor, activities, like, hiking, climbing, trail, running, and, winter, sports, like, skiing, and, snowboarding, the, most, popular, climbing, route, to, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, is, the, go, ter, route, which, typically, takes, two, days, the, three, towns, and, their, communes, which, surround, mont, blanc, are, courmayeur, in, aosta, valley, italy, and, saint, gervais, les, bains, and, chamonix, in, haute, savoie, france, the, latter, town, was, the, site, of, the, first, winter, olympics, a, cable, car, ascends, and, crosses, the, mountain, range, from, courmayeur, to, chamonix, through, the, col, du, g, ant, the, 11, 6, km, 7, 1, 4, mi, mont, blanc, tunnel, constructed, between, 1957, and, 1965, runs, beneath, the, mountain, and, is, a, major, transalpine, transport, route, mont, blanc, and, adjacent, mountains, in, the, massif, are, predominately, formed, from, a, large, intrusion, of, granite, termed, a, batholith, which, was, forced, up, through, a, basement, layer, of, gneiss, and, mica, schists, during, the, variscan, mountain, forming, event, of, the, late, palaeozoic, period, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, is, located, at, the, point, of, contact, of, these, two, rock, types, to, the, southwest, the, granite, contact, is, of, a, more, intrusive, nature, whereas, to, the, northeast, it, changes, to, being, more, tectonic, the, granites, are, mostly, very, coarse, grained, ranging, in, type, from, microgranites, to, porphyroid, granites, the, massif, is, tilted, in, a, north, westerly, direction, and, was, cut, by, near, vertical, recurrent, faults, lying, in, a, north, south, direction, during, the, variscan, orogeny, further, faulting, with, shear, zones, subsequently, occurred, during, the, later, alpine, orogeny, repeated, tectonic, phases, have, caused, breakup, of, the, rock, in, multiple, directions, and, in, overlapping, planes, finally, past, and, current, glaciation, caused, significant, sculpting, of, the, landscape, into, its, present, day, form, the, first, systematic, account, of, the, minerals, of, the, mont, blanc, area, was, published, in, 1873, by, venance, payot, his, list, entitled, statistique, min, ralogique, des, environs, du, mt, blanc, catalogued, 90, mineral, types, although, it, also, included, those, present, only, as, very, small, components, of, rocks, if, these, are, excluded, it, is, known, today, that, at, least, 68, separate, mineral, species, occur, across, the, wider, range, of, the, mont, blanc, massif, located, on, the, watershed, between, the, rh, ne, and, the, po, the, massif, of, mont, blanc, is, also, situated, between, the, two, different, climatic, regions, of, the, northern, and, western, alps, and, that, of, the, southern, alps, climatic, conditions, on, the, mer, de, glace, are, similar, to, those, found, on, the, northern, side, of, the, swiss, alps, 26, the, climate, is, cold, and, temperate, k, ppen, climate, classification, cfb, and, is, greatly, influenced, by, altitude, being, the, highest, part, of, the, alps, mont, blanc, and, surrounding, mountains, can, create, their, own, weather, patterns, temperatures, drop, as, the, mountains, gain, in, height, and, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, is, a, permanent, ice, cap, with, temperatures, around, 20, c, 4, f, the, summit, is, also, prone, to, strong, winds, and, sudden, weather, changes, because, of, its, great, overall, height, a, considerable, proportion, is, permanently, glaciated, or, snow, covered, and, is, exposed, to, extremely, cold, conditions, 24, there, is, however, significant, variation, in, precipitation, with, altitude, for, example, the, village, of, chamonix, below, mont, blanc, is, at, an, elevation, of, approximately, 1, 030, m, 3, 380, ft, it, receives, around, 1, 020, mm, 40, in, of, annual, precipitation, whilst, the, col, du, midi, which, is, at, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, above, sea, level, receives, significantly, more, totalling, 3, 100, mm, 122, in, however, at, an, even, higher, altitude, near, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, precipitation, is, considerably, less, with, only, around, 1, 100, mm, 43, in, recorded, despite, the, latter, measurements, being, taken, at, the, height, of, 4, 300, m, 14, 100, ft, 23, the, mont, blanc, was, the, highest, mountain, of, the, frankish, empire, under, charlemagne, and, the, highest, mountain, of, the, holy, roman, empire, until, 1792, in, 1760, swiss, naturalist, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, began, to, go, to, chamonix, to, observe, mont, blanc, he, tried, to, summit, it, with, the, courmayeur, mountain, guide, jean, laurent, jordaney, a, native, of, pr, saint, didier, who, accompanied, de, saussure, since, 1774, on, the, miage, glacier, and, mont, crammont, the, first, recorded, ascent, of, mont, blanc, at, the, time, neither, within, italy, nor, france, was, on, 8, august, 1786, by, jacques, balmat, and, the, doctor, michel, paccard, this, climb, initiated, by, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, who, rewarded, the, successful, ascent, traditionally, marks, the, start, of, modern, mountaineering, the, first, woman, to, reach, the, summit, was, marie, paradis, in, 1808, at, the, scale, of, the, mont, blanc, massif, the, border, between, italy, and, france, passes, along, most, of, the, main, alpine, watershed, from, the, aiguille, des, glaciers, to, mont, dolent, where, it, reaches, the, border, with, switzerland, however, its, precise, location, near, the, summits, of, mont, blanc, and, nearby, d, me, du, go, ter, is, disputed, italian, officials, claim, the, border, follows, the, watershed, splitting, both, summits, between, italy, and, france, in, contrast, french, officials, claim, the, border, avoids, the, two, summits, placing, them, entirely, with, france, the, size, of, these, two, distinct, disputed, areas, is, approximately, 65, hectares, 160, acres, on, mont, blanc, and, ten, hectares, 25, acres, on, d, me, du, go, ter, in, 1723, the, duke, of, savoy, victor, amadeus, ii, acquired, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, the, resulting, state, of, sardinia, was, to, become, preeminent, in, the, italian, unification, citing, the, treaty, of, paris, 1796, france, claims, that, the, historical, border, of, savoy, and, piedmont, diverged, from, the, watershed, line, fully, encompassing, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, within, savoy, and, consequently, within, french, territory, after, the, napoleonic, wars, the, congress, of, vienna, restored, the, king, of, sardinia, in, savoy, nice, and, piedmont, his, traditional, territories, overruling, the, 1796, treaty, of, paris, forty, five, years, later, after, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, it, was, replaced, by, a, new, legal, act, this, act, was, signed, in, turin, on, 24, march, 1860, by, napoleon, iii, and, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, savoy, and, deals, with, the, annexation, of, savoy, following, the, french, neutrality, for, the, plebiscites, held, in, tuscany, modena, parma, and, romagna, to, join, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, against, the, pope, s, will, a, demarcation, agreement, signed, on, 7, march, 1861, defined, the, new, border, with, the, formation, of, italy, for, the, first, time, mont, blanc, was, located, on, the, border, of, france, and, italy, along, the, old, border, between, the, department, of, savoy, and, that, of, piedmont, formerly, belonging, to, the, savoyard, state, the, 1860, act, is, still, legally, valid, for, both, the, french, and, italian, governments, italy, claims, that, the, border, was, moved, by, france, in, 1865, when, surveys, carried, out, by, a, cartographer, of, the, french, army, captain, jj, mieulet, incorporated, the, summit, into, french, territory, making, the, state, border, deviate, from, the, watershed, line, and, giving, rise, to, the, differences, with, the, maps, published, in, italy, in, the, same, period, modern, swiss, mapping, published, by, the, federal, office, of, topography, plots, a, region, of, disputed, territory, statut, de, territoire, contest, around, the, summits, of, both, mont, blanc, and, the, d, me, du, go, ter, one, of, its, interpretations, of, the, french, italian, border, places, both, summits, straddling, a, line, running, directly, along, the, geographic, ridgeline, watershed, between, france, and, italy, thus, sharing, their, summits, equally, between, both, states, however, a, second, interpretation, places, both, summits, as, well, as, that, of, mont, blanc, de, courmayeur, although, much, less, clearly, in, the, latter, case, solely, within, france, nato, maps, take, data, from, the, italian, national, mapping, agency, the, istituto, geografico, militare, which, is, based, upon, past, treaties, in, force, in, 1890, pierre, janssen, an, astronomer, and, the, director, of, the, meudon, astrophysical, observatory, considered, the, construction, of, an, observatory, at, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, gustave, eiffel, agreed, to, take, on, the, project, provided, he, could, build, on, a, rock, foundation, if, found, at, a, depth, of, less, than, twelve, metres, 39, ft, below, the, ice, in, 1891, the, swiss, surveyor, imfeld, dug, two, 23, metre, 75, ft, horizontal, tunnels, twelve, metres, 39, ft, below, the, ice, summit, but, found, nothing, solid, consequently, the, eiffel, project, was, abandoned, despite, this, the, observatory, was, built, in, 1893, during, the, cold, wave, of, january, 1893, a, temperature, of, 43, c, 45, f, was, recorded, on, mont, blanc, being, the, lowest, ever, recorded, there, levers, attached, to, the, ice, supported, the, observatory, this, worked, to, some, extent, until, 1906, when, the, building, started, leaning, heavily, the, movement, of, the, levers, corrected, the, lean, slightly, but, three, years, later, two, years, after, janssen, s, death, a, crevasse, started, opening, under, the, observatory, it, was, abandoned, eventually, the, building, fell, and, only, the, tower, could, be, saved, in, extremis, the, mountain, was, the, scene, of, two, fatal, air, crashes, air, india, flight, 245, in, 1950, and, air, india, flight, 101, in, 1966, both, planes, were, approaching, geneva, airport, and, the, pilots, miscalculated, their, descent, 48, and, 117, people, respectively, died, the, passengers, on, flight, 101, included, nuclear, scientist, homi, j, bhabha, known, as, the, father, of, india, s, nuclear, programme, in, 1946, a, drilling, project, was, initiated, to, carve, a, tunnel, through, the, mountain, the, mont, blanc, tunnel, would, connect, chamonix, france, and, courmayeur, italy, and, become, one, of, the, major, transalpine, transport, routes, between, the, two, countries, in, 1965, the, tunnel, opened, to, vehicle, traffic, with, a, length, of, 11, 611, metres, 7, 215, mi, in, 1999, a, transport, truck, caught, fire, in, the, tunnel, beneath, the, mountain, in, total, 39, people, were, killed, when, the, fire, raged, out, of, control, the, tunnel, was, renovated, in, the, aftermath, to, increase, driver, safety, renovations, include, computerised, detection, equipment, extra, security, bays, a, parallel, escape, shaft, and, a, fire, station, in, the, middle, of, the, tunnel, the, escape, shafts, also, have, clean, air, flowing, through, them, via, vents, any, people, in, the, security, bays, now, have, live, video, contact, to, communicate, with, the, control, centre, a, remote, site, for, cargo, safety, inspection, was, created, on, each, side, aosta, in, italy, and, passy, le, fayet, in, france, here, all, trucks, are, inspected, before, entering, the, tunnel, these, remote, sites, are, also, used, as, staging, areas, to, control, commercial, traffic, during, peak, hours, the, renovated, tunnel, reopened, three, years, after, the, disaster, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, is, a, thick, perennial, ice, and, snow, dome, whose, thickness, varies, therefore, no, exact, and, permanent, summit, elevation, can, be, determined, though, accurate, measurements, have, been, made, on, specific, dates, its, official, elevation, was, 4, 807, m, 15, 771, ft, for, a, long, time, in, 2002, the, ign, and, expert, surveyors, with, the, aid, of, gps, technology, measured, it, to, be, 4, 807, 40, m, 15, 772, ft, 4, in, after, the, 2003, heatwave, in, europe, a, team, of, scientists, remeasured, the, height, on, 6, and, 7, september, the, team, was, made, up, of, the, glaciologist, luc, moreau, two, surveyors, from, the, gps, company, three, people, from, the, ign, seven, expert, surveyors, four, mountain, guides, from, chamonix, and, saint, gervais, and, four, students, from, various, institutes, in, france, this, team, noted, that, the, elevation, was, 4, 808, 45, m, 15, 775, ft, 9, in, and, the, peak, had, shifted, to, a, point, 75, cm, 30, in, away, from, where, it, had, been, in, 2002, after, these, results, were, published, more, than, 500, points, were, measured, to, assess, the, effects, of, climate, change, and, the, mountain, s, height, fluctuations, at, different, points, since, then, the, mountain, s, elevation, has, been, measured, every, two, years, the, summit, was, measured, again, in, 2005, and, the, results, were, published, on, 16, december, 2005, the, height, was, found, to, be, 4, 808, 75, m, 15, 776, ft, 9, in, 30, cm, 12, in, more, than, the, previously, recorded, height, the, rock, summit, was, found, to, be, at, 4, 792, m, 15, 722, ft, some, 40, m, 130, ft, west, of, the, ice, covered, summit, in, 2007, the, summit, was, measured, at, 4, 807, 9, m, 15, 774, ft, and, in, 2009, at, 4, 807, 45, m, 15, 772, ft, in, 2013, the, summit, was, measured, at, 4, 810, 02, m, 15, 781, ft, and, in, 2015, at, 4, 808, 73, m, 15, 777, ft, from, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, on, a, clear, day, the, jura, the, vosges, the, black, forest, and, the, massif, central, mountain, ranges, can, be, seen, as, well, as, the, principal, summits, of, the, alps, several, classic, climbing, routes, lead, to, the, summit, of, mont, blanc, nowadays, the, summit, is, ascended, by, an, average, of, 20, 000, mountaineer, tourists, each, year, it, could, be, considered, a, technically, easy, yet, arduous, ascent, for, someone, well, trained, and, acclimatised, to, the, altitude, from, l, aiguille, du, midi, where, the, cable, car, stops, mont, blanc, seems, quite, close, being, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, higher, but, while, the, peak, looks, deceptively, close, the, la, voie, des, 3, monts, route, known, to, be, more, technical, and, challenging, than, other, more, commonly, used, routes, requires, more, ascent, over, two, other, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, mountains, mont, blanc, du, tacul, and, mont, maudit, before, the, final, section, of, the, climb, is, reached, the, last, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, push, to, the, summit, is, undertaken, each, year, climbing, deaths, occur, on, mont, blanc, on, the, busiest, weekends, normally, around, august, the, local, rescue, service, performs, an, average, of, 12, missions, mostly, directed, to, aid, people, in, trouble, on, one, of, the, normal, routes, of, the, mountain, some, routes, require, knowledge, of, high, altitude, mountaineering, and, a, guide, or, at, least, an, experienced, mountaineer, and, all, require, proper, equipment, all, routes, are, long, and, arduous, involving, delicate, passages, and, the, hazard, of, rockfall, or, avalanche, climbers, may, also, suffer, altitude, sickness, occasionally, life, threatening, particularly, if, they, are, not, properly, acclimatised, a, 1994, estimate, suggests, there, had, been, 6, 000, to, 8, 000, alpinist, fatalities, in, total, more, than, on, any, other, mountain, 208, these, numbers, exclude, the, fatalities, of, air, india, flight, 245, and, air, india, flight, 101, two, planes, that, crashed, into, mont, blanc, despite, unsubstantiated, claims, recurring, in, media, that, some, estimates, put, the, fatality, rate, at, an, average, of, 100, hikers, a, year, actual, reported, annual, numbers, at, least, since, the, 1990s, are, between, 10, and, 20, in, 2017, fourteen, people, died, out, of, 20, 000, summit, attempts, and, two, remained, missing, with, 15, in, 2018, as, of, august, a, french, study, on, the, especially, risky, go, ter, couloir, on, the, normal, route, on, mont, blanc, and, necessary, rescue, operations, found, that, between, 1990, and, 2011, there, were, 74, deaths, between, the, t, te, rousse, refuge, 3, 187, m, and, the, go, ter, refuge, 3, 830, m, there, were, 17, more, in, 2012, 15, none, in, 2016, and, 11, in, 2017, the, recent, temperature, rises, and, heatwaves, such, as, those, of, the, summers, of, 2015, and, 2018, have, significantly, impacted, many, climbing, routes, across, the, alps, including, those, on, mont, blanc, for, example, in, 2015, the, grand, mulets, route, previously, popular, in, the, 20th, century, was, blocked, by, virtually, impenetrable, crevasse, fields, and, the, gouter, hut, was, closed, by, municipal, decree, for, some, days, because, of, a, very, high, rockfall, danger, with, some, stranded, climbers, evacuated, by, helicopter, in, 2016, a, crevasse, opened, at, high, altitude, also, indicating, previously, unobserved, glacial, movements, the, new, crevasse, forms, an, obstacle, to, be, scaled, by, climbing, parties, on, the, final, part, of, the, itinerary, to, the, top, shared, by, the, popular, go, ter, route, and, the, grand, mulets, route, in, july, 2014, an, american, entrepreneur, and, traveller, patrick, sweeney, attempted, to, break, the, record, with, his, nine, year, old, son, and, 11, year, old, daughter, they, were, caught, in, an, avalanche, escaped, death, and, decided, not, to, pursue, their, attempt, in, august, 2014, an, unknown, austrian, climber, with, his, 5, year, old, son, were, intercepted, by, mountain, gendarmes, at, 3, 200, m, 10, 500, ft, and, forced, to, turn, back, on, 5, august, 2017, 9, year, old, hungarian, twins, and, their, mother, were, rescued, from, 3, 800, m, 12, 500, ft, by, helicopter, while, their, father, and, family, friend, continued, their, summit, attempt, the, mont, blanc, massif, is, being, put, forward, as, a, potential, world, heritage, site, because, of, its, uniqueness, and, cultural, importance, considered, the, birthplace, and, symbol, of, modern, mountaineering, it, would, require, the, three, governments, of, italy, france, and, switzerland, to, request, unesco, for, it, to, be, listed, mont, blanc, is, one, of, the, most, visited, tourist, destinations, in, the, world, for, this, reason, some, view, it, as, threatened, pro, mont, blanc, an, international, collective, of, associations, for, the, protection, of, mont, blanc, published, in, 2002, the, book, le, versant, noir, du, mont, blanc, the, black, hillside, of, mont, blanc, which, exposes, current, and, future, problems, in, conserving, the, site, in, 2007, europe, s, two, highest, toilets, at, 4, 260, metres, 13, 976, feet, were, taken, by, helicopter, to, the, top, of, mont, blanc, they, are, also, serviced, by, helicopter, they, will, serve, 30, 000, skiers, and, hikers, annually, helping, to, alleviate, the, discharge, of, urine, and, faeces, that, spreads, down, the, mountain, face, with, the, spring, thaw, global, warming, has, begun, to, melt, glaciers, and, cause, avalanches, on, mont, blanc, creating, more, dangerous, climbing, conditions
