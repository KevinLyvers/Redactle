times, and, followed, in, october, by, a, 20, article, series, entitled, the, middle, eastern, question, written, by, sir, ignatius, valentine, chirol, during, this, series, sir, ignatius, expanded, the, definition, of, middle, east, to, include, those, regions, of, asia, which, extend, to, the, borders, of, india, or, command, the, approaches, to, india, after, the, series, ended, in, 1903, the, times, removed, quotation, marks, from, subsequent, uses, of, the, term, until, world, war, ii, it, was, customary, to, refer, to, areas, centered, around, turkey, and, the, eastern, shore, of, the, mediterranean, as, the, near, east, while, the, far, east, centered, on, china, and, the, middle, east, then, meant, the, area, from, mesopotamia, to, burma, namely, the, area, between, the, near,

corresponding, adjective, is, middle, eastern, and, the, derived, noun, is, middle, easterner, while, non, eurocentric, terms, such, as, southwest, asia, or, swasia, have, been, sparsely, used, the, inclusion, of, an, african, country, egypt, in, the, definition, questions, the, usefulness, of, using, such, terms, the, description, middle, has, also, led, to, some, confusion, over, changing, definitions, before, the, first, world, war, near, east, was, used, in, english, to, refer, to, the, balkans, and, the, ottoman, empire, while, middle, east, referred, to, the, caucasus, persia, and,

the, usage, near, east, was, retained, by, a, variety, of, academic, disciplines, including, archaeology, and, ancient, history, where, it, describes, an, area, identical, to, the, term, middle, east, which, is, not, used, by, these, disciplines, see, ancient, near, east, the, first, official, use, of, the, term, middle, east, by, the, united, states, government, was, in, the, 1957, eisenhower, doctrine, which, pertained, to, the, suez, crisis, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, defined, the, middle, east, as, the, area, lying, between, and, including, libya, on, the, west, and, pakistan, on, the, east, syria, and, iraq, on, the, north, and, the, arabian, peninsula, to, the, south, plus, the, sudan, and, ethiopia, in, 1958, the, state, department, explained, that, the, terms, near, east, and, middle, east, were, interchangeable, and, defined, the, region, as, including, only, egypt, syria, israel, lebanon, jordan, iraq, saudi, arabia, kuwait, bahrain, and, qatar, the,

or, medio, oriente, and, the, italian, medio, oriente, perhaps, because, of, the, influence, of, the, western, press, the, arabic, equivalent, of, middle, east, arabic, ash, sharq, al, awsa, has,

and, warsaw, pact, on, the, other, as, they, competed, to, influence, regional, allies, besides, the, political, reasons, there, was, also, the, ideological, conflict, between, the, two, systems, moreover, as, louise, fawcett, argues, among, many, important, areas, of, contention, or, perhaps, more, accurately, of, anxiety, were, first, the, desires, of, the, superpowers, to, gain, strategic, advantage, in, the, region, second, the, fact, that, the, region, contained, some, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, oil, reserves, in, a, context, where, oil, was, becoming, increasingly, vital, to, the, economy, of, the, western, world, within, this, contextual, framework, the, united, states, sought, to, divert, the, arab, world, from, soviet, influence, throughout, the, 20th, and, 21st,

employment, for, workers, from, egypt, yemen, and, the, countries, of, the, levant, while, europe, had, attracted, young, workers, from, north, african, countries, due, both, to, proximity, and, the,
