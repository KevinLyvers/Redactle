https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Passage
the, northeast, passage, abbreviated, as, nep, russian, romanized, severo, vostochnyy, prokhod, norwegian, nord, stpassasjen, is, the, shipping, route, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, along, the, arctic, coasts, of, norway, and, russia, the, western, route, through, the, islands, of, canada, is, accordingly, called, the, northwest, passage, nwp, the, nep, traverses, from, west, to, east, the, barents, sea, kara, sea, laptev, sea, east, siberian, sea, and, chukchi, sea, and, it, includes, the, northern, sea, route, nsr, the, northern, sea, route, is, a, portion, of, the, nep, it, is, defined, in, russian, law, and, does, not, include, the, barents, sea, and, therefore, does, not, reach, the, atlantic, ocean, however, since, the, nsr, has, a, significant, overlap, over, the, majority, of, the, nep, the, nsr, term, is, often, used, to, refer, to, the, entirety, of, the, northeast, passage, this, practice, injects, confusion, in, understanding, the, specifics, of, both, navigational, procedures, and, jurisdiction, the, northeast, passage, is, one, of, several, arctic, maritime, routes, the, others, being, the, northwest, passage, going, through, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, and, the, coast, of, alaska, and, the, transpolar, route, going, across, the, north, pole, the, first, confirmed, complete, passage, from, west, to, east, was, made, by, the, finland, swedish, explorer, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, with, the, swedish, ship, vega, 1878, 79, backed, by, the, royal, funding, of, king, oscar, ii, of, sweden, nordenski, ld, was, forced, to, winter, just, a, few, days, sailing, distance, from, the, bering, strait, due, to, pack, ice, the, motivation, to, navigate, the, northeast, passage, was, initially, economic, in, russia, the, idea, of, a, possible, seaway, connecting, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, oceans, was, first, proposed, by, the, diplomat, gerasimov, in, 1525, however, russian, settlers, and, traders, on, the, coast, of, the, white, sea, the, pomors, had, been, exploring, parts, of, the, route, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, during, a, sail, across, the, barents, sea, in, search, of, the, northeast, passage, in, 1553, english, explorer, hugh, willoughby, thought, he, saw, islands, to, the, north, and, islands, called, willoughby, s, land, were, shown, on, maps, published, by, plancius, and, mercator, in, the, 1590s, and, they, continued, to, appear, on, maps, by, jan, janssonius, and, willem, blaeu, into, the, 1640s, by, the, 17th, century, traders, had, established, a, continuous, sea, route, from, arkhangelsk, to, the, yamal, peninsula, where, they, portaged, to, the, gulf, of, ob, this, route, known, as, the, mangazeya, seaway, after, its, eastern, terminus, the, trade, depot, of, mangazeya, was, an, early, precursor, to, the, northern, sea, route, east, of, the, yamal, the, route, north, of, the, taimyr, peninsula, proved, impossible, or, impractical, east, of, the, taimyr, from, the, 1630s, russians, began, to, sail, the, arctic, coast, from, the, mouth, of, the, lena, river, to, a, point, beyond, the, mouth, of, the, kolyma, river, both, vitus, bering, in, 1728, and, james, cook, in, 1778, entered, the, bering, strait, from, the, south, and, sailed, some, distance, northwest, but, from, 1648, semyon, dezhnev, to, 1879, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, no, one, is, recorded, as, having, sailed, eastward, between, the, kolyma, and, bering, strait, the, western, parts, of, the, passage, were, explored, by, northern, european, countries, such, as, england, the, netherlands, denmark, and, norway, looking, for, an, alternative, seaway, to, china, and, india, had, it, proved, practicable, such, a, seaway, would, have, had, enormous, economic, and, military, importance, although, these, expeditions, failed, new, coasts, and, islands, were, discovered, the, most, notable, was, the, 1596, expedition, led, by, dutch, navigator, willem, barentsz, who, discovered, spitsbergen, and, bear, island, and, rounded, the, north, end, of, novaya, zemlya, fearing, english, and, dutch, penetration, into, siberia, russia, closed, the, mangazeya, seaway, in, 1619, pomor, activity, in, northern, asia, declined, and, most, arctic, exploration, in, the, 17th, century, was, carried, out, by, siberian, cossacks, sailing, from, one, river, mouth, to, another, in, their, arctic, worthy, kochs, in, 1648, the, most, famous, of, these, expeditions, led, by, fedot, alekseev, and, semyon, dezhnev, sailed, east, from, the, mouth, of, the, kolyma, river, to, the, pacific, ocean, and, rounded, the, chukchi, peninsula, thus, proving, that, no, land, connection, existed, between, asia, and, north, america, eighty, years, after, dezhnev, in, 1728, another, russian, explorer, danish, born, vitus, bering, on, svyatoy, gavriil, saint, gabriel, made, a, similar, voyage, in, reverse, starting, in, kamchatka, and, going, north, to, the, passage, that, now, bears, his, name, the, bering, strait, it, was, bering, who, named, the, diomede, islands, which, dezhnev, had, vaguely, mentioned, bering, s, explorations, of, 1725, 30, were, part, of, a, larger, scheme, of, peter, the, great, known, as, the, great, northern, expedition, the, second, kamchatka, expedition, took, place, in, 1735, 42, with, two, ships, svyatoy, pyotr, saint, peter, and, svyatoy, pavel, saint, paul, the, latter, commanded, by, bering, s, deputy, in, the, first, expedition, captain, aleksey, chirikov, during, the, second, expedition, bering, became, the, first, westerner, to, sight, the, coast, of, northwestern, north, america, and, chirikov, was, the, first, westerner, to, land, there, a, storm, had, separated, the, two, ships, earlier, on, his, return, leg, bering, discovered, the, aleutian, islands, but, fell, ill, and, svyatoy, pyotr, had, to, take, shelter, on, an, island, off, kamchatka, where, bering, died, bering, island, independent, of, bering, and, chirikov, other, russian, imperial, navy, parties, took, part, in, the, second, great, northern, expedition, one, of, these, led, by, semyon, chelyuskin, in, may, 1742, reached, cape, chelyuskin, the, northernmost, point, of, both, the, northeast, passage, and, the, eurasian, continent, later, expeditions, to, explore, the, northeast, passage, took, place, in, the, 1760s, vasiliy, chichagov, 1785, 95, joseph, billings, and, gavril, sarychev, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, baron, ferdinand, petrovich, wrangel, pyotr, fyodorovich, anjou, count, fyodor, litke, and, others, the, possibility, of, navigating, the, length, of, the, passage, was, proven, by, the, mid, 19th, century, however, it, was, only, in, 1878, 79, that, fenno, swedish, explorer, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, born, in, finland, but, exiled, to, sweden, many, years, before, the, expedition, made, the, first, complete, passage, of, the, northeast, passage, leading, the, vega, expedition, from, west, to, east, the, ship, s, captain, on, this, expedition, was, lieutenant, louis, palander, of, the, swedish, royal, navy, one, year, before, nordenski, ld, s, voyage, commercial, exploitation, of, a, section, of, the, route, started, with, the, so, called, kara, expeditions, exporting, siberian, agricultural, produce, via, the, kara, sea, of, 122, convoys, between, 1877, and, 1919, only, 75, succeeded, transporting, as, little, as, 55, tons, of, cargo, from, 1911, the, kolyma, river, steamboats, ran, from, vladivostok, to, the, kolyma, once, a, year, in, 1912, two, russian, expeditions, set, out, captain, georgy, brusilov, and, the, brusilov, expedition, in, the, santa, anna, and, captain, alexander, kuchin, with, vladimir, rusanov, in, the, gerkules, hercules, each, with, a, woman, on, board, both, expeditions, were, hastily, arranged, and, both, disappeared, the, german, arctic, expedition, of, 1912, led, by, herbert, schr, der, stranz, ended, disastrously, with, only, 7, of, 15, crew, members, surviving, the, preliminary, expedition, to, nordaustlandet, in, 1913, jonas, lied, organized, a, successful, expedition, through, the, kara, sea, to, the, yenisei, explorer, and, scientist, fridtjof, nansen, and, siberian, industrialist, stephan, vostrotin, were, prominent, passengers, lied, had, founded, the, siberian, company, with, the, purpose, of, exporting, and, importing, goods, through, the, great, siberian, rivers, and, the, kara, sea, the, 1913, trip, is, recorded, in, nansen, s, through, siberia, in, 1915, a, russian, expedition, led, by, boris, vilkitskiy, made, the, passage, from, east, to, west, with, the, icebreakers, taymyr, and, vaygach, nordenski, ld, nansen, amundsen, delong, makarov, and, others, also, led, expeditions, mainly, for, scientific, and, cartographic, purposes, the, introduction, of, radio, steamboats, and, icebreakers, made, running, the, northern, sea, route, viable, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, the, soviet, union, was, isolated, from, the, western, powers, which, made, it, imperative, to, use, this, route, besides, being, the, shortest, seaway, between, the, western, and, far, eastern, ussr, it, was, the, only, one, that, lay, completely, inside, soviet, internal, waters, and, did, not, impinge, on, waters, of, opposing, countries, in, 1932, a, soviet, expedition, on, the, icebreaker, a, sibiryakov, led, by, professor, otto, yulievich, schmidt, was, the, first, to, sail, all, the, way, from, arkhangelsk, to, the, bering, strait, in, the, same, summer, without, wintering, en, route, after, trial, runs, in, 1933, and, 1934, the, northern, sea, route, was, officially, defined, and, open, and, commercial, exploitation, began, in, 1935, the, next, year, part, of, the, baltic, fleet, made, the, passage, to, the, pacific, where, armed, conflict, with, japan, was, looming, a, special, governing, body, glavsevmorput, chief, directorate, of, the, northern, sea, route, was, set, up, in, 1932, with, otto, schmidt, as, its, director, it, supervised, navigation, and, built, arctic, ports, during, the, early, part, of, world, war, ii, the, soviets, allowed, the, german, auxiliary, cruiser, komet, to, use, the, northern, sea, route, in, the, summer, of, 1940, to, evade, the, british, royal, navy, and, break, out, into, the, pacific, ocean, komet, was, escorted, by, soviet, icebreakers, during, her, journey, after, the, start, of, the, soviet, german, war, the, soviets, transferred, several, destroyers, from, the, pacific, fleet, to, the, northern, fleet, via, the, arctic, the, soviets, also, used, the, northern, sea, route, to, transfer, materials, from, the, soviet, far, east, to, european, russia, and, the, germans, launched, operation, wunderland, to, interdict, this, traffic, a, convoy, of, seven, brand, new, merchant, vessels, 900, dwt, to, 5500, dwt, built, for, the, people, s, republic, of, china, but, sailing, under, the, polish, flag, from, gdynia, reached, the, port, of, pevek, via, the, kara, vilkitsky, dmitry, laptev, and, sannikov, straits, two, days, of, navigation, before, the, bering, strait, in, 1956, in, july, 1965, uscgc, northwind, wagb, 282, commanded, by, captain, kingdrel, n, ayers, uscg, conducted, an, oceanographic, survey, between, greenland, iceland, and, scotland, and, was, the, first, western, vessel, to, operate, in, the, kara, sea, of, the, soviet, union, for, which, she, received, the, coast, guard, unit, commendation, with, operational, distinguishing, device, the, real, then, classified, mission, of, northwind, was, to, attempt, a, transit, of, the, northeast, passage, the, effort, was, not, successful, due, to, diplomatic, reasons, and, caused, an, international, incident, between, the, u, s, s, r, and, u, s, a, after, the, soviet, union, dissolved, in, the, early, 1990s, commercial, navigation, in, the, siberian, arctic, went, into, decline, regular, shipping, is, found, only, from, murmansk, to, dudinka, in, the, west, and, between, vladivostok, and, pevek, in, the, east, ports, between, dudinka, and, pevek, see, virtually, no, shipping, logashkino, and, nordvik, were, abandoned, and, are, now, ghost, towns, renewed, interest, led, to, several, demonstration, voyages, in, 1997, including, the, passage, of, the, finnish, product, tanker, uikku, a, january, 2013, reuters, news, report, on, expanding, russian, arctic, natural, gas, shipments, to, asia, stated, that, while, shipping, traffic, on, the, nsr, surged, in, 2012, to, around, 1, million, tons, of, various, kinds, of, cargoes, it, pales, by, comparison, with, the, 1987, peak, of, 6, 6, million, tons, it, also, reported, that, the, finnish, crude, oil, tanker, uikku, was, the, first, non, russian, energy, vessel, to, brave, the, nsr, in, 1997, now, the, nsr, is, developing, rapidly, in, 2021, 85, ships, with, around, 2, 75m, tons, of, cargo, made, their, way, along, the, nsr, only, 12, of, which, were, under, the, russian, flag, a, similar, route, to, the, nep, is, the, northern, sea, route, nsr, the, nsr, is, a, shipping, route, that, administratively, begins, at, the, boundary, between, the, barents, and, kara, seas, the, kara, strait, and, ends, in, the, bering, strait, cape, dezhnev, the, length, of, the, northern, sea, route, from, the, kara, gates, to, provideniya, bay, is, about, 5600, km, the, distance, from, st, petersburg, to, vladivostok, through, the, nsr, is, over, 14, thousand, km, for, comparison, the, same, distance, through, the, suez, canal, is, over, 23, thousand, km, the, northern, sea, route, serves, the, arctic, ports, and, major, rivers, of, siberia, by, importing, fuel, equipment, food, and, exporting, timber, and, minerals, the, suez, or, panama, canal, are, the, alternatives, to, the, northern, sea, route, however, if, the, distance, from, the, port, of, murmansk, russia, to, the, port, of, yokohama, japan, through, the, suez, canal, is, 12, 840, nautical, miles, the, same, itinerary, along, the, northern, sea, route, equals, only, 5, 770, nautical, miles, therefore, the, nep, encompasses, all, the, east, arctic, seas, and, the, nsr, all, the, seas, except, the, barents, sea, since, the, nsr, constitutes, the, majority, of, the, nep, sometimes, the, term, nsr, has, been, used, to, refer, to, the, entirety, of, the, nep, the, governance, of, the, nep, has, developed, considerably, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, main, sources, of, governance, are, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, unclos, the, arctic, council, ac, the, international, maritime, organization, imo, and, the, domestic, legislation, of, the, russian, federation, in, combination, they, cover, territorial, claims, economic, exploitation, technical, shipping, requirements, environmental, protection, and, search, and, rescue, responsibilities, for, example, rosatom, assumes, the, possibility, and, functions, of, the, nsr, rosatom, is, a, state, corporation, that, organizes, the, navigation, of, vessels, in, the, waters, of, the, nsr, in, accordance, with, the, merchant, shipping, code, manages, a, fleet, of, powerful, nuclear, icebreakers, ensures, the, safety, and, uninterrupted, operation, of, navigation, provides, port, services, for, gas, tankers, in, case, of, unfavorable, weather, conditions, rosatom, also, provides, navigation, and, hydrographic, support, in, the, waters, of, the, northern, sea, route, develops, the, infrastructure, of, sea, harbors, and, manages, the, state, property, of, these, ports, for, this, purpose, the, directorate, of, the, northern, sea, route, was, formed, that, now, manages, three, subordinate, organizations, atomflot, rosatomflot, hydrographic, enterprise, and, chukotatomenergo, recently, the, main, directorate, of, the, northern, sea, route, glavsevmorput, was, established, on, the, basis, of, the, naval, operations, headquarters, of, fsue, atomflot, the, main, purpose, of, the, creation, of, the, glavsevmorput, is, to, organize, the, navigation, of, vessels, in, the, waters, of, the, northern, sea, route, glavsevmorput, federal, state, budgetary, institution, solves, the, following, tasks, ensuring, the, organization, of, icebreaking, vessels, taking, into, account, the, hydrometeorological, ice, and, navigation, conditions, in, the, waters, of, the, nsr, vessels, navigation, in, the, waters, of, the, nsr, issuance, suspension, renewal, and, termination, of, permits, for, sailing, vessels, in, the, waters, of, the, nsr, to, solve, these, tasks, the, department, arranges, icebreaker, fleet, vessels, in, the, waters, of, the, nsr, monitors, the, traffic, in, the, nsr, water, area, provides, information, on, hydrometeorological, ice, and, navigation, conditions, and, processes, information, from, vessels, located, in, the, nsr, water, area, rosatom, is, a, legacy, member, of, the, arctic, economic, council, that, s, why, all, the, operations, are, aimed, to, establish, economic, well, being, environmental, neutrality, and, human, capital, development, the, northeast, passage, is, a, shorter, route, to, connect, northeast, asia, with, western, europe, compared, to, the, existing, routes, through, the, suez, canal, the, panama, canal, or, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, table, below, shows, the, sailing, distances, between, the, major, east, asia, sea, ports, and, rotterdam, in, europe, these, distances, assume, no, route, diversions, owing, to, ice, conditions, a, usable, northern, sea, route, between, northern, europe, and, north, pacific, ports, would, cut, time, at, sea, and, resultant, fuel, consumption, by, more, than, half, for, the, corporate, players, in, bulk, shipping, of, relative, low, value, raw, materials, cost, savings, for, fuel, may, appear, as, a, driver, to, explore, the, northern, sea, route, for, commercial, transits, and, not, necessarily, reduced, lead, time, the, northern, sea, route, allows, economies, of, scale, compared, to, coastal, route, alternatives, with, vessel, draught, and, beam, limitation, environmental, demands, faced, by, the, maritime, shipping, industry, may, emerge, as, a, driver, for, developing, the, northern, sea, route, increased, awareness, of, environmental, benefits, and, costs, for, both, the, northern, sea, route, and, suez, routes, will, probably, be, important, factors, in, this, respect, in, 2011, four, ships, sailed, the, length, of, the, northern, sea, route, and, northeast, passage, from, the, atlantic, to, pacific, oceans, in, 2012, 46, ships, sailed, the, nsr, in, august, 2012, russian, media, reported, that, 85, of, vessels, transiting, the, northern, sea, route, in, 2011, were, carrying, gas, or, oil, and, 80, were, high, capacity, tankers, as, the, northern, sea, route, is, a, strategically, important, transport, artery, it, can, already, be, called, economically, profitable, in, comparison, for, example, with, the, suez, canal, due, to, a, number, of, reasons, in, september, 2012, inuit, circumpolar, conference, chair, jimmy, stotts, was, reported, as, saying, there, is, concern, that, increased, shipping, could, adversely, affect, indigenous, hunting, of, marine, mammals, also, concerning, is, the, lack, of, infrastructure, on, the, western, alaska, coast, to, deal, with, a, spill, or, a, wrecked, vessel, however, a, polar, opinion, also, does, exist, the, northern, sea, route, is, considerably, shorter, than, the, existing, sea, routes, from, asia, to, europe, which, makes, it, more, ecological, due, to, less, consumption, of, co, 2, a, usable, northern, sea, route, between, northern, europe, and, north, pacific, ports, would, cut, time, at, sea, and, accordingly, fuel, consumption, by, more, than, half, for, the, corporate, players, in, bulk, shipping, of, relative, low, value, raw, materials, cost, savings, for, fuel, may, appear, as, a, driver, to, explore, the, northern, sea, route, for, commercial, transits, and, not, necessarily, reduced, lead, time, the, northern, sea, route, allows, economies, of, scale, compared, to, coastal, route, alternatives, with, vessel, draught, and, beam, limitation, environmental, demands, faced, by, the, maritime, shipping, industry, may, emerge, as, a, driver, for, developing, the, northern, sea, route, according, to, the, fourth, imo, ghg, study, 2020, sea, cargo, transportation, is, responsible, for, 2, 9, of, global, emissions, more, than, that, in, the, next, 20, years, the, trading, maritime, volume, is, expected, to, double, which, may, cause, even, worse, consequences, for, the, environment, now, marine, transport, produces, about, 1, gigaton, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, emissions, per, year, and, has, been, struggling, for, many, years, to, reduce, its, environmental, impact, for, example, the, international, maritime, organization, imo, has, obliged, sea, carriers, to, reduce, co, 2, emissions, by, 50, by, 2050, it, may, seem, very, realistic, but, achieving, this, result, may, become, a, tough, challenge, firstly, marine, transport, generates, 14, of, all, transport, emissions, and, secondly, effective, techniques, that, could, replace, marine, engines, powered, by, fossil, fuels, do, not, exist, yet, due, to, its, shorter, length, navigation, on, the, nsr, contributes, to, reducing, the, carbon, footprint, of, maritime, transport, thus, contributing, to, the, achievement, of, the, paris, agreement, goals, unlike, the, similar, latitudes, in, alaska, and, canada, along, the, northwest, passage, parts, of, the, nep, remain, ice, free, year, round, this, is, mostly, the, case, of, the, barents, sea, by, the, northern, coast, of, norway, and, northwestern, coast, of, russia, the, barents, sea, is, affected, by, the, currents, of, warm, water, from, the, gulf, stream, feeding, into, the, north, atlantic, other, parts, of, the, nep, mostly, the, nsr, part, freeze, in, winter, and, partially, melt, in, the, summer, months, especially, along, the, coasts, since, the, early, 2000s, the, summer, melting, has, been, stronger, and, the, winter, freezing, has, been, weaker, opening, the, waters, to, the, possibility, of, more, non, ice, breaking, ships, taking, advantage, of, the, route, for, longer, periods, of, time, only, one, russian, seaport, in, the, barents, sea, along, the, officially, defined, northern, sea, route, which, begins, at, the, kara, gates, strait, is, ice, free, year, round, murmansk, on, the, kola, peninsula, other, arctic, ports, are, generally, usable, from, july, to, october, or, such, as, dudinka, are, served, by, nuclear, powered, icebreakers, beyond, the, bering, strait, the, end, of, the, northern, sea, route, and, south, along, russia, s, pacific, seaboard, petropavlovsk, in, kamchatka, vanino, nakhodka, and, vladivostok, are, accessible, year, round, the, development, of, the, icebreaking, fleet, is, the, most, important, condition, for, constant, navigation, in, arctic, waters, since, 2008, the, structure, of, rosatom, includes, the, russian, nuclear, icebreaker, fleet, which, is, the, largest, in, the, world, with, a, container, ship, four, service, vessels, and, seven, nuclear, powered, icebreakers, yamal, 50, let, pobedy, taymyr, vaygach, arctic, siberia, and, ural, the, last, three, are, the, latest, universal, icebreakers, of, the, 22220, project, and, the, world, s, only, transport, vessel, with, the, sevmorput, nuclear, power, plant, in, operation, due, to, its, harsh, climatic, conditions, and, the, low, population, density, the, nep, has, had, relatively, little, activity, the, nsr, portion, of, the, nep, experienced, its, highest, levels, of, activity, during, the, soviet, era, the, nsr, greatly, developed, as, a, heavily, subsidized, domestic, route, with, traffic, peaking, in, 1987, with, 6, 58, million, tons, of, cargo, carried, by, 331, ships, over, 1306, voyages, with, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, and, its, subsidies, the, nsr, traffic, collapsed, to, 1, 5, 2, m, tons, of, cargo, since, the, early, 2000s, the, thickness, and, area, extent, of, the, arctic, sea, ice, has, experienced, significant, reduction, compared, to, the, recorded, averages, this, has, led, to, an, increase, in, transit, shipping, in, 2011, four, ships, sailed, the, entire, length, of, the, nep, 46, in, 2012, and, 19, in, 2013, the, number, of, trips, is, still, very, small, compared, to, the, thousands, of, ships, each, year, through, the, suez, canal, mainstream, container, shipping, is, expected, to, continue, to, overwhelmingly, use, the, suez, route, while, niche, activities, like, bulk, shipping, is, expected, to, grow, driven, by, the, mining, industries, of, the, arctic, nevertheless, the, cargo, traffic, is, steadily, growing, every, year, the, research, shows, that, the, nsr, scr, combined, shipping, scheme, can, be, more, competitive, than, the, use, of, the, suez, canal, route, only, if, the, shipping, company, provides, sufficient, loading, on, the, nsr, uses, a, reliable, ice, class, vessel, for, navigation, and, the, price, of, crude, oil, is, high, the, economic, advantage, of, the, nsr, scr, combined, shipping, scheme, is, obvious, ice, thickness, directly, affects, the, shipping, cost, now, when, the, arctic, ice, is, slowly, melting, due, to, weather, conditions, the, cost, of, icebreaking, service, is, expected, to, reduce, also, vessels, of, some, ice, classes, can, sail, on, the, nsr, independently, that, is, why, the, nsr, icebreaker, escort, fee, may, be, several, times, lower, than, the, scr, toll, state, corporation, rosatom, assumes, the, possibility, and, functions, of, the, nsr, and, ensures, the, safety, of, navigation, on, the, high, technological, level, besides, organizing, the, navigation, along, the, nsr, and, the, icebreaking, services, with, the, world, s, only, nuclear, icebreaker, fleet, rosatom, is, planning, to, implement, the, arctic, ice, regime, shipping, system, airss, methodology, this, system, will, represent, a, digital, space, that, will, provide, various, services, to, cargo, carriers, shipowners, captains, insurers, and, other, participants, in, the, logistics, market, on, the, nsr, in, particular, it, involves, issuing, permits, for, the, passage, of, vessels, monitoring, dispatching, and, managing, the, work, of, the, fleet, the, single, digital, platform, will, collect, information, from, all, the, available, sources, for, example, hydrometeorological, data, the, location, of, ships, and, icebreakers, port, congestion, as, a, result, users, will, receive, an, advanced, ice, navigator, that, will, allow, to, plot, a, precise, route, in, view, of, the, changing, ice, conditions, of, the, nsr, in, other, words, the, study, of, sibul, et, al, proposed, a, path, finding, algorithm, for, the, nsr, strategic, assessment, it, uses, real, weather, as, input, and, find, the, optimal, shipping, route, the, term, ice, free, generally, refers, to, the, absence, of, fast, ice, i, e, continuously, frozen, surface, ice, sheet, cover, under, common, usage, ice, free, does, not, mean, that, there, is, no, arctic, sea, ice, ice, free, regions, can, contain, broken, ice, cover, of, varying, density, often, still, requiring, appropriately, strengthened, hulls, or, icebreaker, support, for, safe, passage, french, sailor, eric, brossier, made, the, first, passage, by, sailboat, in, only, one, season, in, the, summer, of, 2002, he, returned, to, europe, the, following, summer, through, the, northwest, passage, the, same, year, arved, fuchs, and, its, crew, sailed, the, northeast, passage, with, the, dagmar, aaen, the, northern, sea, route, was, opened, by, receding, ice, in, 2005, but, was, closed, by, 2007, the, amount, of, polar, ice, had, receded, to, 2005, levels, in, august, 2008, in, late, august, 2008, it, was, reported, that, images, from, the, nasa, aqua, satellite, had, revealed, that, the, last, ice, blockage, of, the, northern, sea, route, in, the, laptev, sea, had, melted, this, would, have, been, the, first, time, since, satellite, records, began, that, both, the, northwest, passage, and, northern, sea, route, had, been, open, simultaneously, however, other, scientists, suggested, that, the, satellite, images, may, have, been, misread, and, that, the, sea, route, was, not, yet, passable, in, 2009, the, bremen, based, beluga, group, claimed, they, were, the, first, western, company, to, attempt, to, cross, the, northern, sea, route, for, shipping, without, assistance, from, icebreakers, cutting, 4000, nautical, miles, off, the, journey, between, ulsan, korea, and, rotterdam, the, voyage, was, widely, covered, and, sometimes, incorrectly, said, to, be, the, first, time, that, non, russian, ships, made, the, transit, in, 1997, a, finnish, oil, tanker, uikku, sailed, the, length, of, the, northern, sea, route, from, murmansk, to, the, bering, strait, becoming, the, first, western, ship, to, complete, the, voyage, however, the, new, 2008, ice, strengthened, heavy, lift, vessels, beluga, fraternity, and, beluga, foresight, commenced, an, east, to, west, passage, of, the, northern, sea, route, in, august, 2009, as, part, of, a, small, convoy, escorted, by, the, russian, nuclear, icebreaker, ns, 50, let, pobedy, westward, through, the, bering, sannikov, and, vilkitskiy, straits, the, two, vessels, embarked, russian, ice, pilots, for, the, voyage, to, the, western, siberian,
