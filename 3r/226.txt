the, great, barrier, reef, is, the, world, s, largest, coral, reef, system, composed, of, over, 2, 900, individual, reefs, and, 900, islands, stretching, for, over, 2, 300, kilometres, 1, 400, mi, over, an, area, of, approximately, 344, 400, square, kilometres, 133, 000, sq, mi, the, reef, is, located, in, the, coral, sea, off, the, coast, of, queensland, australia, separated, from, the, coast, by, a, channel, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, wide, in, places, and, over, 61, metres, 200, ft, deep, the, great, barrier, reef, can, be, seen, from, outer, space, and, is, the, world, s, biggest, single, structure, made, by, living, organisms, this, reef, structure, is, composed, of, and, built, by, billions, of, tiny, organisms, known, as, coral, polyps, it, supports, a, wide, diversity, of, life, and, was, selected, as, a, world, heritage, site, in, 1981, cnn, labelled, it, one, of, the, seven, natural, wonders, of, the, world, in, 1997, australian, world, heritage, places, included, it, in, its, list, in, 2007, the, queensland, national, trust, named, it, a, state, icon, of, queensland, in, 2006, a, large, part, of, the, reef, is, protected, by, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, which, helps, to, limit, the, impact, of, human, use, such, as, fishing, and, tourism, other, environmental, pressures, on, the, reef, and, its, ecosystem, include, runoff, of, humanmade, pollutants, climate, change, accompanied, by, mass, coral, bleaching, dumping, of, dredging, sludge, and, cyclic, population, outbreaks, of, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, according, to, a, study, published, in, october, 2012, by, the, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, the, reef, has, lost, more, than, half, its, coral, cover, since, 1985, a, finding, reaffirmed, by, a, 2020, study, which, found, over, half, of, the, reef, s, coral, cover, to, have, been, lost, between, 1995, and, 2017, with, the, effects, of, a, widespread, 2020, bleaching, event, not, yet, quantified, the, great, barrier, reef, has, long, been, known, to, and, used, by, the, aboriginal, australian, and, torres, strait, islander, peoples, and, is, an, important, part, of, local, groups, cultures, and, spirituality, the, reef, is, a, very, popular, destination, for, tourists, especially, in, the, whitsunday, islands, and, cairns, regions, tourism, is, an, important, economic, activity, for, the, region, generating, over, aud, 3, billion, per, year, in, november, 2014, google, launched, google, underwater, street, view, in, 3d, of, the, great, barrier, reef, a, march, 2016, report, stated, that, coral, bleaching, was, more, widespread, than, previously, thought, seriously, affecting, the, northern, parts, of, the, reef, as, a, result, of, warming, ocean, temperatures, in, october, 2016, outside, published, an, obituary, for, the, reef, the, article, was, criticised, for, being, premature, and, hindering, efforts, to, bolster, the, resilience, of, the, reef, in, march, 2017, the, journal, nature, published, a, paper, showing, that, huge, sections, of, an, 800, kilometre, 500, mi, stretch, in, the, northern, part, of, the, reef, had, died, in, the, course, of, 2016, of, high, water, temperatures, an, event, that, the, authors, put, down, to, the, effects, of, global, climate, change, the, percentage, of, baby, corals, being, born, on, the, great, barrier, reef, dropped, drastically, in, 2018, and, scientists, are, describing, it, as, the, early, stage, of, a, huge, natural, selection, event, unfolding, many, of, the, mature, breeding, adults, died, in, the, bleaching, events, of, 2016, 17, leading, to, low, coral, birth, rates, the, types, of, corals, that, reproduced, also, changed, leading, to, a, long, term, reorganisation, of, the, reef, ecosystem, if, the, trend, continues, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, act, 1975, section, 54, stipulates, an, outlook, report, on, the, reef, s, health, pressures, and, future, every, five, years, the, last, report, was, published, in, 2019, in, march, 2022, another, mass, bleaching, event, has, been, confirmed, which, raised, further, concerns, about, the, future, of, this, reef, system, especially, when, considering, the, possible, effects, of, el, ni, o, weather, phenomenon, the, australian, institute, of, marine, science, conducts, annual, surveys, of, the, great, barrier, reef, s, status, and, the, 2022, report, showed, the, greatest, recovery, in, 36, years, it, is, mainly, due, to, the, regrowth, of, two, thirds, of, the, reef, by, the, fast, growing, acropora, coral, which, is, the, dominant, coral, there, the, great, barrier, reef, has, long, been, known, to, and, used, by, the, aboriginal, australian, and, torres, strait, islander, peoples, and, is, an, important, part, of, local, groups, cultures, and, spirituality, the, first, european, to, sight, the, great, barrier, reef, was, james, cook, in, 1770, who, sailed, and, mapped, the, east, coast, of, australia, on, 11, june, 1770, cook, s, ship, hms, endeavour, ran, aground, on, a, shoal, south, of, the, present, day, location, of, cooktown, requiring, seven, weeks, to, repair, it, was, matthew, flinders, who, named, the, great, barrier, reef, after, his, more, detailed, mapping, of, it, in, 1802, flinders, used, various, terms, to, describe, the, reefs, comprising, what, we, now, call, the, great, barrier, reef, including, great, reef, for, one, such, reef, barrier, reef, for, any, reef, preventing, a, sailing, vessel, in, or, waves, from, the, open, sea, from, reaching, the, coast, and, barrier, reefs, for, the, collection, of, such, reefs, the, great, barrier, reef, is, a, distinct, feature, of, the, east, australian, cordillera, division, it, reaches, from, torres, strait, between, bramble, cay, its, northernmost, island, and, the, south, coast, of, papua, new, guinea, in, the, north, to, the, unnamed, passage, between, lady, elliot, island, its, southernmost, island, and, fraser, island, in, the, south, lady, elliot, island, is, located, 1, 915, km, 1, 190, mi, southeast, of, bramble, cay, as, the, crow, flies, it, includes, the, smaller, murray, islands, the, plate, tectonic, theory, indicates, australia, has, moved, northwards, at, a, rate, of, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, per, year, starting, during, the, cenozoic, 18, eastern, australia, experienced, a, period, of, tectonic, uplift, which, moved, the, drainage, divide, in, queensland, 400, km, 250, mi, inland, also, during, this, time, queensland, experienced, volcanic, eruptions, leading, to, central, and, shield, volcanoes, and, basalt, flows, 19, some, of, these, became, volcanic, islands, 26, after, the, coral, sea, basin, formed, coral, reefs, began, to, grow, in, the, basin, but, until, about, 25, million, years, ago, northern, queensland, was, still, in, temperate, waters, south, of, the, tropics, too, cool, to, support, coral, growth, 27, the, great, barrier, reef, s, development, history, is, complex, after, queensland, drifted, into, tropical, waters, it, was, largely, influenced, by, reef, growth, and, decline, as, sea, level, changed, 27, 28, reefs, can, increase, in, diameter, by, 1, to, 3, centimetres, 0, 39, to, 1, 18, in, per, year, and, grow, vertically, anywhere, from, 1, to, 25, cm, 0, 39, to, 9, 84, in, per, year, however, they, grow, only, above, a, depth, of, 150, metres, 490, ft, due, to, their, need, for, sunlight, and, cannot, grow, above, sea, level, when, queensland, edged, into, tropical, waters, 24, million, years, ago, some, coral, grew, 29, but, a, sedimentation, regime, quickly, developed, with, erosion, of, the, great, dividing, range, creating, river, deltas, oozes, and, turbidites, unsuitable, conditions, for, coral, growth, 10, million, years, ago, the, sea, level, significantly, lowered, which, further, enabled, sedimentation, the, reef, s, substrate, may, have, needed, to, build, up, from, the, sediment, until, its, edge, was, too, far, away, for, suspended, sediments, to, inhibit, coral, growth, in, addition, approximately, 400, 000, years, ago, there, was, a, particularly, warm, interglacial, period, with, higher, sea, levels, and, a, 4, c, 7, f, water, temperature, change, 37, the, land, that, formed, the, substrate, of, the, current, great, barrier, reef, was, a, coastal, plain, formed, from, the, eroded, sediments, of, the, great, dividing, range, with, some, larger, hills, most, of, which, were, themselves, remnants, of, older, reefs, or, in, rare, cases, volcanoes, 26, 18, the, reef, research, centre, a, cooperative, research, centre, has, found, coral, skeleton, deposits, that, date, back, half, a, million, years, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, gbrmpa, considers, the, earliest, evidence, of, complete, reef, structures, to, have, been, 600, 000, years, ago, according, to, the, gbrmpa, the, current, living, reef, structure, is, believed, to, have, begun, growing, on, the, older, platform, about, 20, 000, years, ago, the, australian, institute, of, marine, science, agrees, placing, the, beginning, of, the, growth, of, the, current, reef, at, the, time, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, at, around, that, time, sea, level, was, 120, metres, 390, ft, lower, than, it, is, today, from, 20, 000, years, ago, until, 6, 000, years, ago, sea, level, rose, steadily, around, the, world, as, it, rose, the, corals, could, then, grow, higher, on, the, newly, submerged, maritime, margins, of, the, hills, of, the, coastal, plain, by, around, 13, 000, years, ago, the, sea, level, was, only, 60, metres, 200, ft, lower, than, the, present, day, and, corals, began, to, surround, the, hills, of, the, coastal, plain, which, were, by, then, continental, islands, as, the, sea, level, rose, further, still, most, of, the, continental, islands, were, submerged, the, corals, could, then, overgrow, the, submerged, hills, to, form, the, present, cays, and, reefs, sea, level, here, has, not, risen, significantly, in, the, last, 6, 000, years, the, crc, reef, research, centre, estimates, the, age, of, the, present, living, reef, structure, at, 6, 000, to, 8, 000, years, old, the, shallow, water, reefs, that, can, be, seen, in, air, photographs, and, satellite, images, cover, an, area, of, 20, 679, km, 2, most, about, 80, of, which, has, grown, on, top, of, limestone, platforms, that, are, relics, of, past, pleistocene, phases, of, reef, growth, the, remains, of, an, ancient, barrier, reef, similar, to, the, great, barrier, reef, can, be, found, in, the, kimberley, western, australia, the, great, barrier, reef, world, heritage, area, has, been, divided, into, 70, bioregions, of, which, 30, are, reef, bioregions, in, the, northern, part, of, the, great, barrier, reef, ribbon, reefs, and, deltaic, reefs, have, formed, these, structures, are, not, found, in, the, rest, of, the, reef, system, a, previously, undiscovered, reef, 500, metres, tall, and, 1, 5, km, wide, at, the, base, was, found, in, the, northern, area, in, 2020, there, are, no, atolls, in, the, system, 7, and, reefs, attached, to, the, mainland, are, rare, 18, fringing, reefs, are, distributed, widely, but, are, most, common, towards, the, southern, part, of, the, great, barrier, reef, attached, to, high, islands, for, example, the, whitsunday, islands, lagoonal, reefs, are, found, in, the, southern, great, barrier, reef, and, further, north, off, the, coast, of, princess, charlotte, bay, crescentic, reefs, are, the, most, common, shape, of, reef, in, the, middle, of, the, system, for, example, the, reefs, surrounding, lizard, island, crescentic, reefs, are, also, found, in, the, far, north, of, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, and, in, the, swain, reefs, 20, 22, degrees, south, planar, reefs, are, found, in, the, northern, and, southern, parts, near, cape, york, peninsula, princess, charlotte, bay, and, cairns, most, of, the, islands, on, the, reef, are, found, on, planar, reefs, 158, 160, wonky, holes, can, have, localised, impact, on, the, reef, providing, upwellings, of, fresh, water, sometimes, rich, in, nutrients, contributing, to, eutrophication, navigation, through, and, around, the, reefs, is, a, major, challenge, more, than, 20, ships, were, recorded, lost, in, the, region, between, 1791, and, 1850, surveys, between, 1815, and, 1860, by, phillip, parker, king, in, the, mermaid, francis, price, blackwood, in, hms, fly, owen, stanley, in, the, rattlesnake, and, henry, mangles, denham, in, the, herald, led, to, considerable, navigational, improvements, as, they, outlined, the, contrasting, advantages, and, perils, of, the, inner, route, between, australia, s, east, coast, and, the, western, edge, of, the, reefs, and, the, outer, route, in, the, open, sea, the, great, barrier, reef, supports, an, extraordinary, diversity, of, life, including, many, vulnerable, or, endangered, species, some, of, which, may, be, endemic, to, the, reef, system, thirty, species, of, cetaceans, have, been, recorded, in, the, great, barrier, reef, including, the, dwarf, minke, whale, indo, pacific, humpback, dolphin, and, the, humpback, whale, large, populations, of, dugongs, live, there, more, than, 1, 500, fish, species, live, on, the, reef, including, the, clownfish, red, bass, red, throat, emperor, and, several, species, of, snapper, and, coral, trout, forty, nine, species, mass, spawn, while, eighty, four, other, species, spawn, elsewhere, in, their, range, seventeen, species, of, sea, snake, live, on, the, great, barrier, reef, in, warm, waters, up, to, 50, metres, 160, ft, deep, and, are, more, common, in, the, southern, than, in, the, northern, section, none, found, in, the, great, barrier, reef, world, heritage, area, are, endemic, nor, are, any, endangered, six, species, of, sea, turtles, come, to, the, reef, to, breed, the, green, sea, turtle, leatherback, sea, turtle, hawksbill, turtle, loggerhead, sea, turtle, flatback, turtle, and, the, olive, ridley, the, green, sea, turtles, on, the, great, barrier, reef, have, two, genetically, distinct, populations, one, in, the, northern, part, of, the, reef, and, the, other, in, the, southern, part, fifteen, species, of, seagrass, in, beds, attract, the, dugongs, and, turtles, and, provide, fish, habitat, 133, the, most, common, genera, of, seagrasses, are, halophila, and, halodule, saltwater, crocodiles, live, in, mangrove, and, salt, marshes, on, the, coast, near, the, reef, nesting, has, not, been, reported, and, the, salt, water, crocodile, population, in, the, gbrwha, is, wide, ranging, but, low, density, around, 125, species, of, shark, stingray, skates, or, chimaera, live, on, the, reef, close, to, 5, 000, species, of, mollusc, have, been, recorded, on, the, reef, including, the, giant, clam, and, various, nudibranchs, and, cone, snails, forty, nine, species, of, pipefish, and, nine, species, of, seahorse, have, been, recorded, at, least, seven, species, of, frog, inhabit, the, islands, 215, species, of, birds, including, 22, species, of, seabirds, and, 32, species, of, shorebirds, visit, the, reef, or, nest, or, roost, on, the, islands, 450, 451, including, the, white, bellied, sea, eagle, and, roseate, tern, most, nesting, sites, are, on, islands, in, the, northern, and, southern, regions, of, the, great, barrier, reef, with, 1, 4, to, 1, 7, million, birds, using, the, sites, to, breed, the, islands, of, the, great, barrier, reef, also, support, 2, 195, known, plant, species, three, of, these, are, endemic, the, northern, islands, have, 300, 350, plant, species, which, tend, to, be, woody, whereas, the, southern, islands, have, 200, which, tend, to, be, herbaceous, the, whitsunday, region, is, the, most, diverse, supporting, 1, 141, species, the, plants, are, propagated, by, birds, there, are, at, least, 330, species, of, ascidians, on, the, reef, system, with, the, diameter, of, 1, 10, cm, 0, 4, 4, in, between, 300, and, 500, species, of, bryozoans, live, on, the, reef, four, hundred, coral, species, both, hard, corals, and, soft, corals, inhabit, the, reef, the, majority, of, these, spawn, gametes, breeding, in, mass, spawning, events, that, are, triggered, by, the, rising, sea, temperatures, of, spring, and, summer, the, lunar, cycle, and, the, diurnal, cycle, reefs, in, the, inner, great, barrier, reef, spawn, during, the, week, after, the, full, moon, in, october, while, the, outer, reefs, spawn, in, november, and, december, its, common, soft, corals, belong, to, 36, genera, five, hundred, species, of, marine, algae, or, seaweed, live, on, the, reef, including, thirteen, species, of, genus, halimeda, which, deposit, calcareous, mounds, up, to, 100, metres, 110, yd, wide, creating, mini, ecosystems, on, their, surface, which, have, been, compared, to, rainforest, cover, 185, climate, change, pollution, crown, of, thorns, starfish, and, fishing, are, the, primary, threats, to, the, health, of, this, reef, system, other, threats, include, shipping, accidents, oil, spills, and, tropical, cyclones, skeletal, eroding, band, a, disease, of, bony, corals, caused, by, the, protozoan, halofolliculina, corallasia, affects, 31, coral, species, according, to, a, 2012, study, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, since, 1985, the, great, barrier, reef, has, lost, more, than, half, of, its, corals, with, two, thirds, of, the, loss, occurring, from, 1998, due, to, the, factors, listed, before, in, 2022, the, northern, and, central, parts, of, the, reef, had, the, highest, amount, of, coral, cover, since, monitoring, began, but, the, cover, in, the, southern, part, had, decreased, and, bleaching, events, occurred, more, frequently, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, considers, the, greatest, threat, to, the, great, barrier, reef, to, be, climate, change, causing, ocean, warming, which, increases, coral, bleaching, mass, coral, bleaching, events, due, to, marine, heatwaves, occurred, in, the, summers, of, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017, and, 2020, and, coral, bleaching, is, expected, to, become, an, annual, occurrence, in, 2020, a, study, found, that, the, great, barrier, reef, has, lost, more, than, half, of, its, corals, since, 1995, due, to, warmer, seas, driven, by, climate, change, as, global, warming, continues, corals, will, not, be, able, to, keep, up, with, increasing, ocean, temperatures, coral, bleaching, events, lead, to, increased, disease, susceptibility, which, causes, detrimental, ecological, effects, for, reef, communities, in, july, 2017, unesco, published, in, a, draft, decision, expressing, serious, concern, about, the, impact, of, coral, bleaching, on, the, great, barrier, reef, the, draft, decision, also, warned, australia, that, it, will, not, meet, the, targets, of, the, reef, 2050, report, without, considerable, work, to, improve, water, quality, climate, change, has, implications, for, other, forms, of, reef, life, some, fish, s, preferred, temperature, range, leads, them, to, seek, new, habitat, thus, increasing, chick, mortality, in, predatory, seabirds, climate, change, will, also, affect, the, sea, turtle, s, population, and, available, habitat, bleaching, events, in, benthic, coral, communities, deeper, than, 20, metres, or, 66, feet, in, the, great, barrier, reef, are, not, as, well, documented, as, those, at, shallower, depths, but, recent, research, has, shown, that, benthic, communities, are, just, as, negatively, impacted, in, the, face, of, rising, ocean, temperatures, five, great, barrier, reef, species, of, large, benthic, corals, were, found, bleached, under, elevated, temperatures, affirming, that, benthic, corals, are, vulnerable, to, thermal, stress, another, key, threat, faced, by, the, great, barrier, reef, is, pollution, and, declining, water, quality, the, rivers, of, north, eastern, australia, pollute, the, reef, during, tropical, flood, events, over, 90, of, this, pollution, comes, from, farm, runoff, 80, of, the, land, adjacent, to, the, great, barrier, reef, is, used, for, farming, including, intensive, cropping, of, sugar, cane, and, major, beef, cattle, grazing, farming, practices, damage, the, reef, due, to, overgrazing, increased, run, off, of, agricultural, sediments, nutrients, and, chemicals, including, fertilisers, herbicides, and, pesticides, representing, a, major, health, risk, for, the, coral, and, biodiversity, of, the, reefs, according, to, a, 2016, report, while, higher, regulation, contributes, to, less, overall, pollution, from, other, land, uses, such, as, industrial, mining, port, development, dredging, and, urban, development, these, can, still, be, locally, significant, sediments, containing, high, levels, of, copper, and, other, heavy, metals, sourced, from, the, ok, tedi, mine, in, papua, new, guinea, are, a, potential, pollution, risk, for, the, far, northern, great, barrier, reef, and, torres, strait, regions, some, 67, of, corals, died, in, the, reef, s, worst, hit, northern, section, the, arc, centre, of, excellence, for, coral, reef, studies, report, said, the, runoff, problem, is, exacerbated, by, the, loss, of, coastal, wetlands, which, act, as, a, natural, filter, for, toxins, and, help, deposit, sediment, it, is, thought, that, the, poor, water, quality, is, due, to, increased, light, and, oxygen, competition, from, algae, farming, fertiliser, runoff, release, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, into, the, oceanic, ecosystem, and, these, limiting, nutrients, cause, massive, algal, growth, which, eventually, leads, to, a, reduction, in, oxygen, available, for, other, creatures, in, a, process, called, eutrophication, this, decreases, the, biodiversity, in, the, affected, areas, altering, the, species, composition, a, study, by, katharina, fabricius, and, glen, death, of, australian, institute, of, marine, science, found, that, hard, corals, numbers, were, almost, double, on, reefs, that, were, far, from, agricultural, areas, fertilizers, also, increase, the, amount, of, phytoplankton, available, for, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, larvae, to, consume, a, study, showed, that, a, doubling, of, the, chlorophyll, in, the, water, leads, to, a, tenfold, increase, in, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, larvae, s, survival, rate, sediment, runoff, from, farming, carries, chemicals, into, the, reef, environment, also, reduces, the, amount, of, light, available, to, the, corals, decreasing, their, ability, to, extract, energy, from, their, environment, pesticides, used, in, farming, are, made, up, of, heavy, metals, such, as, lead, mercury, arsenic, and, other, toxins, are, released, into, the, wider, environment, due, to, erosion, of, farm, soil, which, has, a, detrimental, effect, on, the, coral, mining, company, queensland, nickel, discharged, nitrate, laden, water, into, the, great, barrier, reef, in, 2009, and, 2011, on, the, later, occasion, releasing, 516, tonnes, 508, long, tons, 569, short, tons, of, waste, water, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, gbrmpa, stated, we, have, strongly, encouraged, the, company, to, investigate, options, that, do, not, entail, releasing, the, material, to, the, environment, and, to, develop, a, management, plan, to, eliminate, this, potential, hazard, however, gbrmpa, does, not, have, legislative, control, over, how, the, yabulu, tailings, dam, is, managed, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, preys, on, coral, polyps, large, outbreaks, of, these, starfish, can, devastate, reefs, in, 2000, an, outbreak, contributed, to, a, loss, of, 66, of, live, coral, cover, on, sampled, reefs, in, a, study, by, the, reef, research, centre, rrc, outbreaks, are, believed, to, occur, in, natural, cycles, worsened, by, poor, water, quality, and, overfishing, of, the, starfish, s, predators, the, unsustainable, overfishing, of, keystone, species, such, as, the, giant, triton, can, disrupt, food, chains, vital, to, reef, life, fishing, also, impacts, the, reef, through, increased, water, pollution, from, boats, by, catch, of, unwanted, species, such, as, dolphins, and, turtles, and, habitat, destruction, from, trawling, anchors, and, nets, as, of, the, middle, of, 2004, approximately, one, third, of, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, is, protected, from, species, removal, of, any, kind, including, fishing, without, written, permission, shipping, accidents, are, a, pressing, concern, as, several, commercial, shipping, routes, pass, through, the, great, barrier, reef, although, the, route, through, the, great, barrier, reef, is, not, easy, reef, pilots, consider, it, safer, than, outside, the, reef, in, the, event, of, mechanical, failure, since, a, ship, can, sit, safely, while, being, repaired, there, have, been, over, 1, 600, known, shipwrecks, in, the, great, barrier, reef, region, on, 3, april, 2010, the, bulk, coal, carrier, shen, neng, 1, ran, aground, on, douglas, shoals, spilling, up, to, four, tonnes, of, oil, into, the, water, and, causing, extensive, damage, to, the, reef, the, government, of, queensland, has, a, shark, control, program, shark, culling, that, deliberately, kills, sharks, throughout, queensland, including, in, the, great, barrier, reef, environmentalists, and, scientists, say, that, this, program, harms, the, marine, ecosystem, they, also, say, it, is, outdated, cruel, and, ineffective, the, queensland, shark, control, program, uses, shark, nets, and, drum, lines, with, baited, hooks, to, kill, sharks, in, the, great, barrier, reef, there, are, 173, lethal, drum, lines, in, the, great, barrier, reef, in, queensland, sharks, found, alive, on, the, baited, hooks, are, shot, queensland, s, shark, control, program, killed, about, 50, 000, sharks, from, 1962, to, 2018, also, queensland, s, shark, control, program, has, also, killed, many, other, animals, such, as, dolphins, and, turtles, the, program, killed, 84, 000, marine, animals, from, 1962, to, 2015, including, in, the, great, barrier, reef, in, 2018, humane, society, international, filed, a, lawsuit, against, the, government, of, queensland, to, stop, shark, culling, in, the, great, barrier, reef, in, march, 2015, the, australian, and, queensland, s, governments, formed, a, plan, for, the, protection, and, preservation, of, the, reef, s, universal, heritage, until, 2050, this, 35, years, plan, titled, reef, 2050, plan, is, a, document, proposing, possible, measures, for, the, long, term, management, of, the, pollution, climate, change, and, other, issues, that, threaten, the, life, span, and, value, of, this, global, heritage, the, plan, contains, all, the, elements, for, measurement, and, improvements, including, long, term, sustainability, plan, water, quality, improvement, plan, and, the, investment, plan, for, the, protection, and, preservation, of, the, reef, until, 2050, however, whereas, the, 2050, plan, aims, to, incorporate, protective, measures, such, as, improving, water, quality, reef, restoration, killing, of, predatory, starfish, it, does, not, incorporate, additional, measures, to, address, what, may, be, the, root, cause, the, problem, climate, change, which, is, caused, by, greenhouse, gas, emissions, as, such, experts, doubted, whether, it, would, be, enough, to, save, the, fragile, environment, another, issue, is, that, the, time, left, to, the, 1, 5, c, warming, threshold, the, temperature, limit, that, coral, reefs, can, still, cope, with, is, very, limited, as, part, of, the, reef, 2050, plan, an, aud, 443, million, grant, was, given, to, the, great, barrier, reef, foundation, in, 2018, the, announcement, of, the, grant, was, subject, to, backlash, as, the, grant, had, avoided, proper, tender, and, transparency, processes, the, great, barrier, reef, contributes, to, the, overall, wellbeing, of, the, marine, biome, numerous, species, of, aquatic, plants, fish, and, megafauna, use, the, reef, for, feeding, shelter, and, mating, threats, such, as, ocean, acidification, pollution, runoff, and, outbreaks, of, destructive, species, like, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, have, brought, about, the, decline, of, this, ecosystem, these, threats, to, the, reef, are, not, only, a, danger, to, the, organisms, inhabiting, it, but, also, the, economy, of, this, region, a, large, part, of, which, relies, on, revenue, from, ecotourism, of, the, great, barrier, reef, the, australian, government, has, had, the, goal, of, protecting, this, world, heritage, site, since, 1972, when, they, created, the, australian, institute, of, marine, science, the, australian, and, queensland, governments, have, contributed, about, 142, 5, million, to, their, national, environmental, science, program, which, is, how, they, ve, collected, much, of, their, data, regarding, threats, to, the, great, barrier, reef, in, addition, the, reef, 2050, water, quality, improvement, plan, was, announced, in, 2018, in, order, to, help, transition, local, communities, agricultural, organizations, and, industries, to, more, sustainable, practices, this, plan, will, join, the, queensland, government, and, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, to, manage, the, amounts, of, runoff, that, reach, the, great, barrier, reef, as, well, as, mitigating, crown, of, thorns, starfish, population, flare, ups, the, great, barrier, reef, has, long, been, known, to, and, used, by, the, aboriginal, australian, and, torres, strait, islander, peoples, aboriginal, australians, have, been, living, in, the, area, for, at, least, 40, 000, years, and, torres, strait, islanders, since, about, 10, 000, years, ago, for, these, 70, or, so, clan, groups, the, reef, is, also, an, important, cultural, feature, in, 1768, louis, de, bougainville, found, the, reef, during, an, exploratory, mission, but, did, not, claim, the, area, for, the, french, on, 11, june, 1770, hm, bark, endeavour, captained, by, explorer, james, cook, ran, aground, on, the, great, barrier, reef, sustaining, considerable, damage, lightening, the, ship, and, re, floating, it, during, an, incoming, tide, eventually, saved, it, one, of, the, most, famous, wrecks, was, hms, pandora, which, sank, on, 29, august, 1791, killing, 35, men, the, queensland, museum, has, led, archaeological, digs, to, wreck, of, pandora, since, 1983, because, the, reef, had, no, atolls, it, was, largely, unstudied, in, the, 19th, century, 7, during, this, time, some, of, the, reef, s, islands, were, mined, for, deposits, of, guano, and, lighthouses, were, built, as, beacons, throughout, the, system, 452, as, in, raine, island, the, earliest, example, in, 1922, the, great, barrier, reef, committee, began, carrying, out, much, of, the, early, research, on, the, reef, 9, royal, commissions, disallowed, oil, drilling, in, the, great, barrier, reef, in, 1975, the, government, of, australia, created, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, and, prohibited, various, activities, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, does, not, include, the, entire, great, barrier, reef, province, the, park, is, managed, in, partnership, with, the, government, of, queensland, through, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, to, ensure, that, it, is, used, in, a, sustainable, manner, a, combination, of, zoning, management, plans, permits, education, and, incentives, such, as, eco, tourism, certification, are, employed, in, the, effort, to, conserve, the, reef, in, 1999, the, australian, parliament, passed, the, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, which, improved, the, operation, of, national, environmental, law, by, providing, guidance, about, regional, biodiversity, conservation, priorities, the, marine, bioregional, planning, process, came, from, the, implementation, of, this, law, this, process, conserves, marine, biodiversity, by, considering, the, whole, ecosystem, a, species, is, in, and, how, different, species, interact, in, the, marine, environment, there, are, two, steps, to, this, process, the, first, step, is, to, identify, regional, conservation, priorities, in, the, five, currently, different, marine, regions, the, second, step, is, to, identify, marine, reserves, protected, areas, or, marine, parks, to, be, added, to, australia, s, national, representative, system, of, marine, protected, areas, like, protected, areas, on, land, marine, reserves, are, created, to, protect, biodiversity, for, generations, to, come, marine, reserves, are, identified, based, on, criteria, written, in, a, document, created, by, australian, and, new, zealand, environment, and, conservation, council, called, guidelines, for, establishing, the, national, representative, system, of, marine, protected, areas, also, known, as, just, the, guidelines, these, guidelines, are, nationally, recognised, and, implemented, at, the, local, level, based, on, the, australian, policy, for, implementation, outlined, in, the, goals, and, principles, for, the, establishment, of, the, national, representative, system, of, marine, protected, areas, in, commonwealth, waters, these, policies, are, in, place, to, make, sure, that, a, marine, reserve, is, only, added, to, the, nrsmpa, after, careful, evaluation, of, different, data, the, priorities, for, each, region, are, created, based, on, human, and, environmental, threats, and, the, marine, bioregional, plans, are, drafted, to, address, these, priorities, to, assess, different, region, s, priorities, three, steps, are, taken, first, a, bioregional, profile, is, created, second, a, bioregional, plan, is, drafted, and, third, the, plan, is, finalised, after, the, plan, is, finalised, activity, in, different, bioregions, may, become, limited, based, on, particular, threats, an, activity, may, pose, in, 2001, the, gbrmpa, released, a, report, about, the, declining, water, quality, in, the, great, barrier, reef, and, detailed, the, importance, of, this, issue, in, response, to, this, report, in, 2003, the, australian, and, queensland, governments, launched, a, joint, initiative, to, improve, the, quality, of, water, entering, the, great, barrier, reef, the, decline, in, the, quality, of, water, over, the, past, 150, years, due, to, development, has, contributed, to, coral, bleaching, algal, blooms, and, pesticide, pollution, these, forms, of, pollution, have, made, the, reef, less, resilient, to, climate, change, when, the, plan, was, introduced, in, october, 2003, it, originally, contained, 65, actions, built, on, previous, legislation, their, immediate, goal, was, to, halt, and, reverse, the, decline, in, water, quality, entering, the, reef, by, 2013, by, 2020, they, hope, that, the, quality, of, the, water, entering, in, the, reef, improves, enough, so, that, it, doesn, t, have, a, detrimental, impact, on, the, health, of, the, great, barrier, reef, to, achieve, these, goals, they, decided, to, reduce, pollutants, in, the, water, entering, the, reef, and, to, rehabilitate, and, conserve, areas, of, the, reef, that, naturally, help, reduce, water, pollutants, to, achieve, the, objectives, described, above, this, plan, focuses, on, non, point, sources, of, pollution, which, cannot, be, traced, to, a, single, source, such, as, a, waste, outlet, the, plan, specifically, targets, nutrients, pesticides, and, sediment, that, make, their, way, into, the, reef, as, a, result, of, agricultural, activities, other, non, point, sources, of, pollution, that, are, attributed, to, urban, areas, are, covered, under, different, legislation, in, 2009, the, plan, was, updated, the, updated, version, states, that, to, date, none, of, the, efforts, undertaken, to, improve, the, quality, of, water, entering, the, reef, has, been, successful, the, new, plan, attempts, to, address, this, issue, by, targeting, priority, outcomes, integrating, industry, and, community, initiatives, and, incorporating, new, policy, and, regulatory, frameworks, reef, plan, 5, this, updated, version, has, improved, the, clarity, of, the, previous, plan, and, targets, set, by, that, plan, have, improved, accountability, and, further, improved, monitoring, and, assessment, the, 2009, report, found, that, 41, out, of, the, 65, actions, met, their, original, goals, however, 18, were, not, progressing, well, according, to, evaluation, criteria, as, well, as, 6, were, rated, as, having, unsatisfactory, levels, of, progress, some, key, achievements, made, since, the, plan, s, initial, passing, in, 2003, were, the, establishment, of, the, reef, quality, partnership, to, set, targets, report, findings, and, monitor, progress, towards, targets, improved, land, condition, by, landowners, was, rewarded, with, extended, leases, water, quality, improvement, plans, were, created, to, identify, regional, targets, and, identified, management, changes, that, needed, to, be, made, to, reach, those, targets, nutrient, management, zones, have, been, created, to, combat, sediment, loss, in, particular, areas, education, programs, have, been, started, to, help, gather, support, for, sustainable, agriculture, changes, to, land, management, practices, have, taken, place, through, the, implementation, of, the, farm, management, systems, and, codes, of, practice, the, creation, of, the, queensland, wetland, program, and, other, achievements, were, made, to, help, improve, the, water, quality, flowing, into, the, coral, reefs, a, taskforce, of, scientists, was, also, created, to, assess, the, impact, of, different, parts, of, the, plan, on, the, quality, of, water, flowing, into, the, coral, reefs, they, found, that, many, of, the, goals, have, yet, to, be, reached, but, found, more, evidence, that, states, that, improving, the, water, quality, of, the, great, barrier, reef, will, improve, its, resilience, to, climate, change, the, reefocus, summit, in, 2008, which, is, also, detailed, in, the, report, came, to, similar, conclusions, after, this, a, stakeholder, working, group, was, formed, that, worked, between, several, groups, as, well, as, the, australian, and, queensland, governments, to, update, reef, goals, and, objectives, the, updated, version, of, the, plan, focuses, on, strategic, priority, areas, and, actions, to, achieve, 2013, goals, also, quantitative, targets, have, been, made, to, critically, assess, whether, targets, are, being, met, some, examples, of, the, water, quality, goals, outlined, by, this, plan, are, that, by, 2013, there, will, be, a, 50, reduction, in, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, loads, at, the, end, of, catchments, and, that, by, 2020, there, will, be, a, reduction, in, sediment, load, by, 20, the, plan, also, outlines, a, number, of, steps, that, must, be, taken, by, landholders, to, help, improve, grazing, soil, nutrient, and, chemical, management, practices, there, are, also, a, number, of, supporting, initiatives, to, take, place, outlined, in, the, plan, to, help, create, a, framework, to, improve, land, use, practices, which, will, in, turn, improve, water, quality, through, these, means, the, governments, of, australia, and, queensland, hope, to, improve, water, quality, by, 2013, the, 2013, outlook, report, and, revised, water, quality, plan, will, assess, what, needs, to, be, done, in, the, future, to, improve, water, quality, and, the, livelihoods, of, the, wildlife, that, resides, there, in, july, 2004, a, new, zoning, plan, took, effect, for, the, entire, marine, park, and, has, been, widely, acclaimed, as, a, new, global, benchmark, for, marine, ecosystem, conservation, the, rezoning, was, based, on, the, application, of, systematic, conservation, planning, techniques, using, marxan, software, while, protection, across, the, marine, park, was, improved, the, highly, protected, zones, increased, from, 4, 5, to, over, 33, 3, at, the, time, it, was, the, largest, marine, protected, area, in, the, world, although, in, 2006, the, new, northwestern, hawaiian, islands, national, monument, became, the, largest, in, 2006, a, review, of, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, act, of, 1975, recommended, that, there, should, be, no, further, zoning, plan, changes, until, 2013, and, that, every, five, years, a, peer, reviewed, outlook, report, should, be, published, examining, the, reef, s, health, management, and, environmental, pressures, in, each, outlook, report, several, assessments, are, required, each, assessment, has, a, set, of, assessment, criteria, that, allows, for, better, presentation, of, available, evidence, each, assessment, is, judged, by, these, criteria, and, given, a, grade, every, outlook, report, follows, the, same, judging, and, grading, process, so, that, information, can, be, tracked, over, time, no, new, research, is, done, to, produce, the, report, only, readily, available, information, goes, into, the, report, so, little, of, what, is, known, about, the, reef, is, actually, featured, in, each, outlook, report, in, december, 2013, greg, hunt, the, australian, environment, minister, approved, a, plan, for, dredging, to, create, three, shipping, terminals, as, part, of, the, construction, of, a, coalport, according, to, corresponding, approval, documents, the, process, will, create, around, 3, million, cubic, metres, of, dredged, seabed, that, will, be, dumped, within, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, area, on, 31, january, 2014, the, gbrmpa, issued, a, dumping, permit, that, will, allow, three, million, cubic, metres, of, sea, bed, from, abbot, point, north, of, bowen, to, be, transported, and, unloaded, in, the, waters, of, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, potential, significant, harms, have, been, identified, in, relation, to, dredge, spoil, and, the, process, of, churning, up, the, sea, floor, in, the, area, and, exposing, it, to, air, firstly, new, research, shows, the, finer, particles, of, dredge, spoil, can, cloud, the, water, and, block, sunlight, thereby, starving, sea, grass, and, coral, up, to, distances, of, 80, km, away, from, the, point, of, origin, due, to, the, actions, of, wind, and, currents, furthermore, dredge, spoil, can, literally, smother, reef, or, sea, grass, to, death, while, storms, can, repeatedly, resuspend, these, particles, so, that, the, harm, caused, is, ongoing, secondly, disturbed, sea, floor, can, release, toxic, substances, into, the, surrounding, environment, the, dredge, spoil, from, the, abbot, point, port, project, is, to, be, dumped, 24, kilometres, 15, mi, away, near, bowen, in, north, queensland, and, the, approval, from, the, authority, will, result, in, the, production, of, an, extra, 70, million, tonnes, of, coal, annually, worth, between, a, 1, 4, billion, and, 2, 8, billion, authority, chairman, dr, russell, reichelt, stated, after, the, confirmation, of, the, approval, this, approval, is, in, line, with, the, agency, s, view, that, port, development, along, the, great, barrier, reef, coastline, should, be, limited, to, existing, ports, as, a, deepwater, port, that, has, been, in, operation, for, nearly, 30, years, abbot, point, is, better, placed, than, other, ports, along, the, great, barrier, reef, coastline, to, undertake, expansion, as, the, capital, and, maintenance, dredging, required, will, be, significantly, less, than, what, would, be, required, in, other, areas, it, s, important, to, note, the, seafloor, of, the, approved, disposal, area, consists, of, sand, silt, and, clay, and, does, not, contain, coral, reefs, or, seagrass, beds, the, approval, was, provided, with, a, corresponding, set, of, 47, new, environmental, conditions, that, include, the, following, the, australian, federal, government, announced, on, 13, november, that, there, would, now, be, a, ban, on, the, dumping, of, dredge, spoil, in, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, the, world, heritage, committee, asked, environment, minister, greg, hunt, to, investigate, alternative, options, to, dump, on, land, instead, the, queensland, government, and, the, commonwealth, have, now, accepted, the, alternative, option, and, advice, from, the, world, heritage, committee, and, will, now, commence, dumping, on, land, due, to, its, vast, biodiversity, warm, clear, waters, and, accessibility, from, the, tourist, boats, called, live, aboards, the, reef, is, a, very, popular, destination, especially, for, scuba, divers, tourism, on, the, great, barrier, reef, is, concentrated, in, cairns, and, also, the, whitsundays, due, to, their, accessibility, these, areas, make, up, 7, 8, of, the, park, s, area, the, whitsundays, and, cairns, have, their, own, plans, of, management, many, cities, along, the, queensland, coast, offer, daily, boat, trips, several, continental, and, coral, cay, islands, are, now, resorts, including, green, island, and, lady, elliot, island, as, of, 1996, 27, islands, on, the, great, barrier, reef, supported, resorts, in, 1996, most, of, the, tourism, in, the, region, was, domestically, generated, and, the, most, popular, visiting, times, were, during, the, australian, winter, at, this, time, it, was, estimated, that, tourists, to, the, great, barrier, reef, contributed, a, 776, million, per, annum, as, the, largest, commercial, activity, in, the, region, it, was, estimated, in, 2003, that, tourism, generated, over, a, 4, billion, annually, and, the, 2005, estimate, increased, to, a, 5, 1, billion, a, deloitte, report, published, by, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, in, march, 2013, states, that, the, reef, s, 2, 000, kilometres, of, coastline, attracts, tourism, worth, a, 6, 4, billion, annually, and, employs, more, than, 64, 000, people, approximately, two, million, people, visit, the, great, barrier, reef, each, year, although, most, of, these, visits, are, managed, in, partnership, with, the, marine, tourism, industry, there, is, a, concern, among, the, general, public, that, tourism, is, harmful, to, the, great, barrier, reef, a, variety, of, boat, tours, and, cruises, are, offered, from, single, day, trips, to, longer, voyages, boat, sizes, range, from, dinghies, to, superyachts, glass, bottomed, boats, and, underwater, observatories, are, also, popular, as, are, helicopter, flights, by, far, the, most, popular, tourist, activities, on, the, great, barrier, reef, are, snorkelling, and, diving, for, which, pontoons, are, often, used, and, the, area, is, often, enclosed, by, nets, the, outer, part, of, the, great, barrier, reef, is, favoured, for, such, activities, due, to, water, quality, management, of, tourism, in, the, great, barrier, reef, is, geared, towards, making, tourism, ecologically, sustainable, a, daily, fee, is, levied, that, goes, towards, research, of, the, great, barrier, reef, this, fee, ends, up, being, 20, of, the, gbrmpa, s, income, policies, on, cruise, ships, bareboat, charters, and, anchorages, limit, the, traffic, on, the, great, barrier, reef, the, problems, that, surround, ecotourism, in, the, great, barrier, reef, revolve, around, permanent, tourism, platforms, platforms, are, large, ship, like, vessels, that, act, as, a, base, for, tourists, while, scuba, diving, and, snorkelling, in, the, great, barrier, reef, seabirds, will, land, on, the, platforms, and, defecate, which, will, eventually, be, washed, into, the, sea, the, feces, carry, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, often, ddt, and, mercury, which, cause, aspergillosis, yellow, band, disease, and, black, band, disease, areas, without, tourism, platforms, have, 14, out, of, 9, 468, 1, 1, diseased, corals, versus, areas, with, tourism, platforms, that, have, 172, out, of, 7, 043, 12, diseased, corals, tourism, is, a, major, economic, activity, for, the, region, thus, while, non, permanent, platforms, could, be, possible, in, some, areas, overall, permanent, platforms, are, likely, a, necessity, solutions, have, been, suggested, to, siphon, bird, waste, into, gutters, connecting, to, tanks, helping, lower, runoff, that, causes, coral, disease, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, has, also, placed, many, permanent, anchorage, points, around, the, general, use, areas, these, act, to, reduce, damage, to, the, reef, due, to, anchoring, destroying, soft, coral, chipping, hard, coral, and, disturbing, sediment, as, it, is, dragged, across, the, bottom, tourism, operators, also, must, comply, with, speed, limits, when, travelling, to, or, from, tourist, destinations, to, prevent, excessive, wake, from, the, boats, disturbing, the, reef, ecosystem, the, fishing, industry, in, the, great, barrier, reef, controlled, by, the, queensland, government, is, worth, a, 1, billion, annually, it, employs, approximately, 2000, people, and, fishing, in, the, great, barrier, reef, is, pursued, commercially, for, recreation, and, as, a, traditional, means, for, feeding, one, s, family, under, the, native, title, act, 1993, native, title, holders, retain, the, right, to, legally, hunt, dugongs, and, green, turtles, for, personal, domestic, or, non, commercial, communal, needs, four, traditional, owners, groups, agreed, to, cease, the, hunting, of, dugongs, in, the, area, in, 2011, due, to, their, declining, numbers, partially, accelerated, by, seagrass, damage, from, cyclone, yasi, cave, dive, sites
