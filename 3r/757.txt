a, slum, is, a, highly, populated, urban, residential, area, consisting, of, densely, packed, housing, units, of, weak, build, quality, and, often, associated, with, poverty, the, infrastructure, in, slums, is, often, deteriorated, or, incomplete, and, they, are, primarily, inhabited, by, impoverished, people, although, slums, are, usually, located, in, urban, areas, in, some, countries, they, can, be, located, in, suburban, areas, where, housing, quality, is, low, and, living, conditions, are, poor, while, slums, differ, in, size, and, other, characteristics, most, lack, reliable, sanitation, services, supply, of, clean, water, reliable, electricity, law, enforcement, and, other, basic, services, slum, residences, vary, from, shanty, houses, to, professionally, built, dwellings, which, because, of, poor, quality, construction, or, lack, of, basic, maintenance, have, deteriorated, due, to, increasing, urbanization, of, the, general, populace, slums, became, common, in, the, 19th, to, late, 20th, centuries, in, the, united, states, and, europe, slums, are, still, predominantly, found, in, urban, regions, of, developing, countries, but, are, also, still, found, in, developed, economies, the, world, s, largest, slum, city, is, found, in, orangi, in, karachi, pakistan, slums, form, and, grow, in, different, parts, of, the, world, for, many, different, reasons, causes, include, rapid, rural, to, urban, migration, economic, stagnation, and, depression, high, unemployment, poverty, informal, economy, forced, or, manipulated, ghettoization, poor, planning, politics, natural, disasters, and, social, conflicts, strategies, tried, to, reduce, and, transform, slums, in, different, countries, with, varying, degrees, of, success, include, a, combination, of, slum, removal, slum, relocation, slum, upgrading, urban, planning, with, citywide, infrastructure, development, and, public, housing, the, un, defines, slums, as, individuals, living, under, the, same, roof, lacking, one, or, more, of, the, following, conditions, access, to, improved, water, access, to, improved, sanitation, sufficient, living, area, housing, durability, and, security, of, tenure, it, is, thought, that, slum, is, a, british, slang, word, from, the, east, end, of, london, meaning, room, which, evolved, to, back, slum, around, 1845, meaning, back, alley, street, of, poor, people, numerous, other, non, english, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, with, slum, shanty, town, favela, rookery, gecekondu, skid, row, barrio, ghetto, banlieue, bidonville, taudis, bandas, de, miseria, barrio, marginal, morro, paragkoupoli, loteamento, barraca, musseque, iskuwater, inner, city, tugurio, solares, mudun, safi, kawasan, kumuh, karyan, medina, achouaia, brarek, ishash,

connotations, and, using, this, label, for, an, area, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, delegitimize, that, land, use, when, hoping, to, repurpose, it, before, the, 19th, century, rich, and, poor, people, lived, in, the, same, districts, with, the, wealthy, living, on, the, high, streets, and, the, poor, in, the, service, streets, behind, them, but, in, the, 19th, century, wealthy, and, upper, middle, class, people, began, to, move, out, of, the, central, part, of, rapidly, growing, cities, leaving, poorer, residents, behind, slums, were, common, in, the, united, states, and, europe, before, the, early, 20th, century, london, s, east, end, is, generally, considered, the, locale, where, the, term, originated, in, the, 19th, century, where, massive, and, rapid, urbanization, of, the, dockside, and, industrial, areas, led, to, intensive, overcrowding, in, a, warren, of, post, medieval, streetscape, the, suffering, of, the, poor, was, described, in, popular, fiction, by, moralist, authors, such, as, charles, dickens, most, famously, oliver, twist, 1837, 9, and, echoed, the, christian, socialist, values, of, the, time, which, soon, found, legal, expression, in, the, public, health, act, of, 1848, as, the, slum, clearance, movement, gathered, pace, deprived, areas, such, as, old, nichol, were, fictionalised, to, raise, awareness, in, the, middle, classes, in, the, form, of, moralist, novels, such, as, a, child, of, the, jago, 1896, resulting, in, slum, clearance, and, reconstruction, programmes, such, as, the, boundary, estate, 1893, 1900, and, the, creation, of, charitable, trusts, such, as, the, peabody, trust, founded, in, 1862, and, joseph, rowntree, foundation, 1904, which, still, operate, to, provide, decent, housing, today, slums, are, often, associated, with, victorian, britain, particularly, in, industrial, english, towns, lowland, scottish, towns, and, dublin, city, in, ireland, friedrich, engels, described, these, british, neighborhoods, as, cattle, sheds, for, human, beings, these, were, generally, still, inhabited, until, the, 1940s, when, the, british, government, started, slum, clearance, and, built, new, council, houses, there, are, still, examples, left, of, slum, housing, in, the, uk, but, many, have, been, removed, by, government, initiative, redesigned, and, replaced, with, better, public, housing, in, europe, slums, were, common, by, the, 1920s, it, had, become, a, common, slang, expression, in, england, meaning, either, various, taverns, and, eating, houses, loose, talk, or, gypsy, language, or, a, room, with, low, going, ons, in, life, in, london, 1821, pierce, egan, used, the, word, in, the, context, of, the, back, slums, of, holy, lane, or, st, giles, a, footnote, defined, slum, to, mean, low, unfrequent, parts, of, the, town, charles, dickens, used, the, word, slum, in, a, similar, way, in, 1840, writing, i, mean, to, take, a, great, london, back, slum, kind, walk, tonight, slum, began, to, be, used, to, describe, bad, housing, soon, after, and, was, used, as, alternative, expression, for, rookeries, in, 1850, the, catholic, cardinal, wiseman, described, the, area, known, as, devil, s, acre, in, westminster, london, as, follows, close, under, the, abbey, of, westminster, there, lie, concealed, labyrinths, of, lanes, and, potty, and, alleys, and, slums, nests, of, ignorance, vice, depravity, and, crime, as, well, as, of, squalor, wretchedness, and, disease, whose, atmosphere, is, typhus, whose, ventilation, is, cholera, in, which, swarms, of, huge, and, almost, countless, population, nominally, at, least, catholic, haunts, of, filth, which, no, sewage, committee, can, reach, dark, corners, which, no, lighting, board, can, brighten, this, passage, was, widely, quoted, in, the, national, press, leading, to, the, popularization, of, the, word, slum, to, describe, bad, housing, in, france, as, in, most, industrialised, european, capitals, slums, were, widespread, in, paris, and, other, urban, areas, in, the, 19th, century, many, of, which, continued, through, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, cholera, epidemic, of, 1832, triggered, a, political, debate, and, louis, ren, villerm, study, of, various, arrondissements, of, paris, demonstrated, the, differences, and, connection, between, slums, poverty, and, poor, health, melun, law, first, passed, in, 1849, and, revised, in, 1851, followed, by, establishment, of, paris, commission, on, unhealthful, dwellings, in, 1852, began, the, social, process, of, identifying, the, worst, housing, inside, slums, but, did, not, remove, or, replace, slums, after, world, war, ii, french, people, started, mass, migration, from, rural, to, urban, areas, of, france, this, demographic, and, economic, trend, rapidly, raised, rents, of, existing, housing, as, well, as, expanded, slums, french, government, passed, laws, to, block, increase, in, the, rent, of, housing, which, inadvertently, made, many, housing, projects, unprofitable, and, increased, slums, in, 1950, france, launched, its, habitation, loyer, mod, r, initiative, to, finance, and, build, public, housing, and, remove, slums, managed, by, techniciens, urban, technocrats, and, financed, by, livret, a, a, tax, free, savings, account, for, french, public, some, slums, remain, in, the, early, 21st, century, in, france, most, of, which, are, dismantled, after, a, few, months, the, largest, being, the, petite, ceinture, slum, on, the, northern, paris, decommissioned, train, tracks, new, york, city, is, believed, to, have, created, the, united, states, first, slum, named, the, five, points, in, 1825, as, it, evolved, into, a, large, urban, settlement, five, points, was, named, for, a, lake, named, collect, which, by, the, late, 1700s, was, surrounded, by, slaughterhouses, and, tanneries, which, emptied, their, waste, directly, into, its, waters, trash, piled, up, as, well, and, by, the, early, 1800s, the, lake, was, filled, up, and, dry, on, this, foundation, was, built, five, points, the, united, states, first, slum, five, points, was, occupied, by, successive, waves, of, freed, slaves, irish, then, italian, then, chinese, immigrants, it, housed, the, poor, rural, people, leaving, farms, for, opportunity, and, the, persecuted, people, from, europe, pouring, into, new, york, city, bars, bordellos, squalid, and, lightless, tenements, lined, its, streets, violence, and, crime, were, commonplace, politicians, and, social, elite, discussed, it, with, derision, slums, like, five, points, triggered, discussions, of, affordable, housing, and, slum, removal, as, of, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, five, points, slum, had, been, transformed, into, the, little, italy, and, chinatown, neighborhoods, of, new, york, city, through, that, city, s, campaign, of, massive, urban, renewal, five, points, was, not, the, only, slum, in, america, jacob, riis, walker, evans, lewis, hine, and, others, photographed, many, before, world, war, ii, slums, were, found, in, every, major, urban, region, of, the, united, states, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, long, after, the, great, depression, most, of, these, slums, had, been, ignored, by, the, cities, and, states, which, encompassed, them, until, the, 1960s, war, on, poverty, was, undertaken, by, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, a, type, of, slum, housing, sometimes, called, poorhouses, crowded, boston, common, later, at, the, fringes, of, the, city, rio, de, janeiro, documented, its, first, slum, in, 1920, census, by, the, 1960s, over, 33, of, population, of, rio, lived, in, slums, 45, of, mexico, city, and, ankara, 65, of, algiers, 35, of, caracas, 25, of, lima, and, santiago, 15, of, singapore, by, 1980, in, various, cities, and, towns, of, latin, america, alone, there, were, about, 25, 000, slums, slums, sprout, and, continue, for, a, combination, of, demographic, social, economic, and, political, reasons, common, causes, include, rapid, rural, to, urban, migration, poor, planning, economic, stagnation, and, depression, poverty, high, unemployment, informal, economy, colonialism, and, segregation, politics, natural, disasters, and, social, conflicts, rural, urban, migration, is, one, of, the, causes, attributed, to, the, formation, and, expansion, of, slums, since, 1950, world, population, has, increased, at, a, far, greater, rate, than, the, total, amount, of, arable, land, even, as, agriculture, contributes, a, much, smaller, percentage, of, the, total, economy, for, example, in, india, agriculture, accounted, for, 52, of, its, gdp, in, 1954, and, only, 19, in, 2004, in, brazil, the, 2050, gdp, contribution, of, agriculture, is, one, fifth, of, its, contribution, in, 1951, agriculture, meanwhile, has, also, become, higher, yielding, less, disease, prone, less, physically, harsh, and, more, efficient, with, tractors, and, other, equipment, the, proportion, of, people, working, in, agriculture, has, declined, by, 30, over, the, last, 50, years, while, global, population, has, increased, by, 250, many, people, move, to, urban, areas, primarily, because, cities, promise, more, jobs, better, schools, for, poor, s, children, and, diverse, income, opportunities, than, subsistence, farming, in, rural, areas, for, example, in, 1995, 95, 8, of, migrants, to, surabaya, indonesia, reported, that, jobs, were, their, primary, motivation, for, moving, to, the, city, however, some, rural, migrants, may, not, find, jobs, immediately, because, of, their, lack, of, skills, and, the, increasingly, competitive, job, markets, which, leads, to, their, financial, shortage, many, cities, on, the, other, hand, do, not, provide, enough, low, cost, housing, for, a, large, number, of, rural, urban, migrant, workers, some, rural, urban, migrant, workers, cannot, afford, housing, in, cities, and, eventually, settle, down, in, only, affordable, slums, further, rural, migrants, mainly, lured, by, higher, incomes, continue, to, flood, into, cities, they, thus, expand, the, existing, urban, slums, according, to, ali, and, toran, social, networks, might, also, explain, rural, urban, migration, and, people, s, ultimate, settlement, in, slums, in, addition, to, migration, for, jobs, a, portion, of, people, migrate, to, cities, because, of, their, connection, with, relatives, or, families, once, their, family, support, in, urban, areas, is, in, slums, those, rural, migrants, intend, to, live, with, them, in, slums, the, formation, of, slums, is, closely, linked, to, urbanization, in, 2008, more, than, 50, of, the, world, s, population, lived, in, urban, areas, in, china, for, example, it, is, estimated, that, the, population, living, in, urban, areas, will, increase, by, 10, within, a, decade, according, to, its, current, rates, of, urbanization, the, un, habitat, reports, that, 43, of, urban, population, in, developing, countries, and, 78, of, those, in, the, least, developed, countries, are, slum, dwellers, some, scholars, suggest, that, urbanization, creates, slums, because, local, governments, are, unable, to, manage, urbanization, and, migrant, workers, without, an, affordable, place, to, live, in, dwell, in, slums, rapid, urbanization, drives, economic, growth, and, causes, people, to, seek, working, and, investment, opportunities, in, urban, areas, however, as, evidenced, by, poor, urban, infrastructure, and, insufficient, housing, the, local, governments, sometimes, are, unable, to, manage, this, transition, this, incapacity, can, be, attributed, to, insufficient, funds, and, inexperience, to, handle, and, organize, problems, brought, by, migration, and, urbanization, in, some, cases, local, governments, ignore, the, flux, of, immigrants, during, the, process, of, urbanization, such, examples, can, be, found, in, many, african, countries, in, the, early, 1950s, many, african, governments, believed, that, slums, would, finally, disappear, with, economic, growth, in, urban, areas, they, neglected, rapidly, spreading, slums, due, to, increased, rural, urban, migration, caused, by, urbanization, some, governments, moreover, mapped, the, land, where, slums, occupied, as, undeveloped, land, another, type, of, urbanization, does, not, involve, economic, growth, but, economic, stagnation, or, low, growth, mainly, contributing, to, slum, growth, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, parts, of, asia, this, type, of, urbanization, involves, a, high, rate, of, unemployment, insufficient, financial, resources, and, inconsistent, urban, planning, policy, in, these, areas, an, increase, of, 1, in, urban, population, will, result, in, an, increase, of, 1, 84, in, slum, prevalence, urbanization, might, also, force, some, people, to, live, in, slums, when, it, influences, land, use, by, transforming, agricultural, land, into, urban, areas, and, increases, land, value, during, the, process, of, urbanization, some, agricultural, land, is, used, for, additional, urban, activities, more, investment, will, come, into, these, areas, which, increases, the, land, value, before, some, land, is, completely, urbanized, there, is, a, period, when, the, land, can, be, used, for, neither, urban, activities, nor, agriculture, the, income, from, the, land, will, decline, which, decreases, the, people, s, incomes, in, that, area, the, gap, between, people, s, low, income, and, the, high, land, price, forces, some, people, to, look, for, and, construct, cheap, informal, settlements, which, are, known, as, slums, in, urban, areas, the, transformation, of, agricultural, land, also, provides, surplus, labour, as, peasants, have, to, seek, jobs, in, urban, areas, as, rural, urban, migrant, workers, many, slums, are, part, of, economies, of, agglomeration, in, which, there, is, an, emergence, of, economies, of, scale, at, the, firm, level, transport, costs, and, the, mobility, of, the, industrial, labour, force, the, increase, in, returns, of, scale, will, mean, that, the, production, of, each, good, will, take, place, in, a, single, location, and, even, though, an, agglomerated, economy, benefits, these, cities, by, bringing, in, specialization, and, multiple, competing, suppliers, the, conditions, of, slums, continue, to, lag, behind, in, terms, of, quality, and, adequate, housing, alonso, villar, argues, that, the, existence, of, transport, costs, implies, that, the, best, locations, for, a, firm, will, be, those, with, easy, access, to, markets, and, the, best, locations, for, workers, those, with, easy, access, to, goods, the, concentration, is, the, result, of, a, self, reinforcing, process, of, agglomeration, concentration, is, a, common, trend, of, the, distribution, of, population, urban, growth, is, dramatically, intense, in, the, less, developed, countries, where, a, large, number, of, huge, cities, have, started, to, appear, which, means, high, poverty, rates, crime, pollution, and, congestion, lack, of, affordable, low, cost, housing, and, poor, planning, encourages, the, supply, side, of, slums, the, millennium, development, goals, proposes, that, member, nations, should, make, a, significant, improvement, in, the, lives, of, at, least, 100, million, slum, dwellers, by, 2020, if, member, nations, succeed, in, achieving, this, goal, 90, of, the, world, total, slum, dwellers, may, remain, in, the, poorly, housed, settlements, by, 2020, choguill, claims, that, the, large, number, of, slum, dwellers, indicates, a, deficiency, of, practical, housing, policy, whenever, there, is, a, significant, gap, in, growing, demand, for, housing, and, insufficient, supply, of, affordable, housing, this, gap, is, typically, met, in, part, by, slums, the, economist, has, observed, that, good, housing, is, obviously, better, than, a, slum, but, a, slum, is, better, than, none, insufficient, financial, resources, and, lack, of, coordination, in, government, bureaucracy, are, two, main, causes, of, poor, house, planning, financial, deficiency, in, some, governments, may, explain, the, lack, of, affordable, public, housing, for, the, poor, since, any, improvement, of, the, tenant, in, slums, and, expansion, of, public, housing, programs, involve, a, great, increase, in, the, government, expenditure, the, problem, can, also, lie, on, the, failure, in, coordination, among, different, departments, in, charge, of, economic, development, urban, planning, and, land, allocation, in, some, cities, governments, assume, that, the, housing, market, will, adjust, the, supply, of, housing, with, a, change, in, demand, however, with, little, economic, incentive, the, housing, market, is, more, likely, to, develop, middle, income, housing, rather, than, low, cost, housing, the, urban, poor, gradually, become, marginalized, in, the, housing, market, where, few, houses, are, built, to, sell, to, them, some, of, the, slums, in, today, s, world, are, a, product, of, urbanization, brought, by, colonialism, for, instance, the, europeans, arrived, in, kenya, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, created, urban, centers, such, as, nairobi, mainly, to, serve, their, financial, interests, they, regarded, the, africans, as, temporary, migrants, and, needed, them, only, for, supply, of, labour, the, housing, policy, aiming, to, accommodate, these, workers, was, not, well, enforced, and, the, government, built, settlements, in, the, form, of, single, occupancy, bedspaces, due, to, the, cost, of, time, and, money, in, their, movement, back, and, forth, between, rural, and, urban, areas, their, families, gradually, migrated, to, the, urban, centre, as, they, could, not, afford, to, buy, houses, slums, were, thus, formed, others, were, created, because, of, segregation, imposed, by, the, colonialists, for, example, dharavi, slum, of, mumbai, now, one, of, the, largest, slums, in, india, used, to, be, a, village, referred, to, as, koliwadas, and, mumbai, used, to, be, referred, as, bombay, in, 1887, the, british, colonial, government, expelled, all, tanneries, other, noxious, industry, and, poor, natives, who, worked, in, the, peninsular, part, of, the, city, and, colonial, housing, area, to, what, was, back, then, the, northern, fringe, of, the, city, a, settlement, now, called, dharavi, this, settlement, attracted, no, colonial, supervision, or, investment, in, terms, of, road, infrastructure, sanitation, public, services, or, housing, the, poor, moved, into, dharavi, found, work, as, servants, in, colonial, offices, and, homes, and, in, the, foreign, owned, tanneries, and, other, polluting, industries, near, dharavi, to, live, the, poor, built, shanty, towns, within, easy, commute, to, work, by, 1947, the, year, india, became, an, independent, nation, of, the, commonwealth, dharavi, had, blossomed, into, bombay, s, largest, slum, similarly, some, of, the, slums, of, lagos, nigeria, sprouted, because, of, neglect, and, policies, of, the, colonial, era, during, apartheid, era, of, south, africa, under, the, pretext, of, sanitation, and, plague, epidemic, prevention, racial, and, ethnic, group, segregation, was, pursued, people, of, colour, were, moved, to, the, fringes, of, the, city, policies, that, created, soweto, and, other, slums, officially, called, townships, large, slums, started, at, the, fringes, of, segregation, conscious, colonial, city, centers, of, latin, america, marcuse, suggests, ghettoes, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, have, been, created, and, maintained, by, the, segregationist, policies, of, the, state, and, regionally, dominant, group, social, exclusion, and, poor, infrastructure, forces, the, poor, to, adapt, to, conditions, beyond, his, or, her, control, poor, families, that, cannot, afford, transportation, or, those, who, simply, lack, any, form, of, affordable, public, transportation, generally, end, up, in, squat, settlements, within, walking, distance, or, close, enough, to, the, place, of, their, formal, or, informal, employment, ben, arimah, cites, this, social, exclusion, and, poor, infrastructure, as, a, cause, for, numerous, slums, in, african, cities, poor, quality, unpaved, streets, encourage, slums, a, 1, increase, in, paved, all, season, roads, claims, arimah, reduces, slum, incidence, rate, by, about, 0, 35, affordable, public, transport, and, economic, infrastructure, empowers, poor, people, to, move, and, consider, housing, options, other, than, their, current, slums, a, growing, economy, that, creates, jobs, at, rate, faster, than, population, growth, offers, people, opportunities, and, incentive, to, relocate, from, poor, slum, to, more, developed, neighborhoods, economic, stagnation, in, contrast, creates, uncertainties, and, risks, for, the, poor, encouraging, people, to, stay, in, the, slums, economic, stagnation, in, a, nation, with, a, growing, population, reduces, per, capita, disposal, income, in, urban, and, rural, areas, increasing, urban, and, rural, poverty, rising, rural, poverty, also, encourages, migration, to, urban, areas, a, poorly, performing, economy, in, other, words, increases, poverty, and, rural, to, urban, migration, thereby, increasing, slums, many, slums, grow, because, of, growing, informal, economy, which, creates, demand, for, workers, informal, economy, is, that, part, of, an, economy, that, is, neither, registered, as, a, business, nor, licensed, one, that, does, not, pay, taxes, and, is, not, monitored, by, local, state, or, federal, government, informal, economy, grows, faster, than, formal, economy, when, government, laws, and, regulations, are, opaque, and, excessive, government, bureaucracy, is, corrupt, and, abusive, of, entrepreneurs, labour, laws, are, inflexible, or, when, law, enforcement, is, poor, urban, informal, sector, is, between, 20, and, 60, of, most, developing, economies, gdp, in, kenya, 78, per, cent, of, non, agricultural, employment, is, in, the, informal, sector, making, up, 42, per, cent, of, gdp, in, many, cities, the, informal, sector, accounts, for, as, much, as, 60, per, cent, of, employment, of, the, urban, population, for, example, in, benin, slum, dwellers, comprise, 75, per, cent, of, informal, sector, workers, while, in, burkina, faso, the, central, african, republic, chad, and, ethiopia, they, make, up, 90, per, cent, of, the, informal, labour, force, slums, thus, create, an, informal, alternate, economic, ecosystem, that, demands, low, paid, flexible, workers, something, impoverished, residents, of, slums, deliver, in, other, words, countries, where, starting, registering, and, running, a, formal, business, is, difficult, tend, to, encourage, informal, businesses, and, slums, without, a, sustainable, formal, economy, that, raise, incomes, and, create, opportunities, squalid, slums, are, likely, to, continue, the, world, bank, and, un, habitat, estimate, assuming, no, major, economic, reforms, are, undertaken, more, than, 80, of, additional, jobs, in, urban, areas, of, developing, world, may, be, low, paying, jobs, in, the, informal, sector, everything, else, remaining, same, this, explosive, growth, in, the, informal, sector, is, likely, to, be, accompanied, by, a, rapid, growth, of, slums, research, in, the, latest, years, based, on, ethnographic, studies, conducted, since, 2008, about, slums, published, initially, in, 2017, has, found, out, the, primary, importance, of, labour, as, the, main, cause, of, emergence, rural, urban, migration, consolidation, and, growth, of, informal, settlements, it, also, showed, that, work, has, also, a, crucial, role, in, the, self, construction, of, houses, alleys, and, overall, informal, planning, of, slums, as, well, as, constituting, a, central, aspect, by, residents, living, in, slums, when, their, communities, suffer, upgrading, schemes, or, when, they, are, resettled, to, formal, housing, for, example, it, was, recently, proved, that, in, a, small, favela, in, the, northeast, of, brazil, favela, sururu, de, capote, the, migration, of, dismissed, sugar, cane, factory, workers, to, the, city, of, macei, who, initiated, the, self, construction, of, the, favela, has, been, driven, by, the, necessity, to, find, a, job, in, the, city, the, same, observation, was, noticed, on, the, new, migrants, who, contribute, to, the, consolidation, and, growth, of, the, slum, also, the, choice, of, the, terrain, for, the, construction, of, the, favela, the, margins, of, a, lagoon, followed, the, rationale, that, it, could, offer, conditions, to, provide, them, means, of, work, circa, 80, of, residents, living, in, that, community, live, from, the, fishery, of, a, mussel, which, divides, the, community, through, gender, and, age, alleys, and, houses, were, planned, to, facilitate, the, working, activities, that, provided, subsistence, and, livelihood, to, the, community, when, resettled, the, main, reason, of, changes, of, formal, housing, units, was, due, to, the, lack, of, possibilities, to, perform, their, work, in, the, new, houses, designed, according, to, formal, architecture, principles, or, even, by, the, distances, they, had, to, travel, to, work, in, the, slum, where, they, originally, lived, which, was, in, turn, faced, by, residents, by, self, constructing, spaces, to, shelter, the, work, originally, performed, in, the, slum, in, the, formal, housing, units, similar, observations, were, made, in, other, slums, residents, also, reported, that, their, work, constitutes, their, dignity, citizenship, and, self, esteem, in, the, underprivileged, settings, in, which, they, live, the, reflection, of, this, recent, research, was, possible, due, to, participatory, observations, and, the, fact, that, the, author, of, the, research, has, lived, in, a, slum, to, verify, the, socioeconomic, practices, which, were, prone, to, shape, plan, and, govern, space, in, slums, urban, poverty, encourages, the, formation, and, demand, for, slums, with, rapid, shift, from, rural, to, urban, life, poverty, migrates, to, urban, areas, the, urban, poor, arrives, with, hope, and, very, little, of, anything, else, they, typically, have, no, access, to, shelter, basic, urban, services, and, social, amenities, slums, are, often, the, only, option, for, the, urban, poor, many, local, and, national, governments, have, for, political, interests, subverted, efforts, to, remove, reduce, or, upgrade, slums, into, better, housing, options, for, the, poor, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, for, example, french, political, parties, relied, on, votes, from, slum, population, and, had, vested, interests, in, maintaining, that, voting, block, removal, and, replacement, of, slum, created, a, conflict, of, interest, and, politics, prevented, efforts, to, remove, relocate, or, upgrade, the, slums, into, housing, projects, that, are, better, than, the, slums, similar, dynamics, are, cited, in, favelas, of, brazil, slums, of, india, and, shanty, towns, of, kenya, scholars, claim, politics, also, drives, rural, urban, migration, and, subsequent, settlement, patterns, pre, existing, patronage, networks, sometimes, in, the, form, of, gangs, and, other, times, in, the, form, of, political, parties, or, social, activists, inside, slums, seek, to, maintain, their, economic, social, and, political, power, these, social, and, political, groups, have, vested, interests, to, encourage, migration, by, ethnic, groups, that, will, help, maintain, the, slums, and, reject, alternate, housing, options, even, if, the, alternate, options, are, better, in, every, aspect, than, the, slums, they, seek, to, replace, millions, of, lebanese, people, formed, slums, during, the, lebanese, civil, war, from, 1975, to, 1990, similarly, in, recent, years, numerous, slums, have, sprung, around, kabul, to, accommodate, rural, afghans, escaping, taliban, violence, major, natural, disasters, in, poor, nations, often, lead, to, migration, of, disaster, affected, families, from, areas, crippled, by, the, disaster, to, unaffected, areas, the, creation, of, temporary, tent, city, and, slums, or, expansion, of, existing, slums, these, slums, tend, to, become, permanent, because, the, residents, do, not, want, to, leave, as, in, the, case, of, slums, near, port, au, prince, after, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, and, slums, near, dhaka, after, 2007, bangladesh, cyclone, sidr, slums, typically, begin, at, the, outskirts, of, a, city, over, time, the, city, may, expand, past, the, original, slums, enclosing, the, slums, inside, the, urban, perimeter, new, slums, sprout, at, the, new, boundaries, of, the, expanding, city, usually, on, publicly, owned, lands, thereby, creating, an, urban, sprawl, mix, of, formal, settlements, industry, retail, zones, and, slums, this, makes, the, original, slums, valuable, property, densely, populated, with, many, conveniences, attractive, to, the, poor, at, their, start, slums, are, typically, located, in, the, least, desirable, lands, near, the, town, or, city, that, are, state, owned, are, part, of, a, philanthropic, trust, possessed, by, a, religious, entity, or, have, no, clear, land, title, in, cities, located, in, mountainous, terrain, slums, begin, on, difficult, to, reach, slopes, or, start, at, the, bottom, of, flood, prone, valleys, often, hidden, from, the, plain, view, of, downtown, but, close, to, some, natural, water, source, in, cities, located, near, lagoons, marshlands, and, rivers, they, start, on, banks, or, on, stilts, above, water, or, the, dry, river, bed, in, flat, terrain, slums, begin, on, lands, unsuitable, for, agriculture, near, city, trash, dumps, next, to, railway, tracks, and, other, shunned, undesirable, locations, these, strategies, shield, slums, from, the, risk, of, being, noticed, and, removed, when, they, are, small, and, most, vulnerable, to, local, government, officials, initial, homes, tend, to, be, tents, and, shacks, that, are, quick, to, install, but, as, a, slum, grows, becomes, established, and, newcomers, pay, the, informal, association, or, gang, for, the, right, to, live, in, the, slum, the, construction, materials, for, the, slums, switches, to, more, durable, materials, such, as, bricks, and, concrete, suitable, for, slum, s, topography, the, original, slums, over, time, get, established, next, to, centers, of, economic, activity, schools, hospitals, and, sources, of, employment, which, the, poor, rely, on, established, old, slums, surrounded, by, the, formal, city, infrastructure, cannot, expand, horizontally, therefore, they, grow, vertically, by, stacking, additional, rooms, sometimes, for, a, growing, family, and, sometimes, as, a, source, of, rent, from, new, arrivals, in, slums, some, slums, name, themselves, after, founders, of, political, parties, locally, respected, historical, figures, current, politicians, or, a, politician, s, spouse, to, garner, political, backing, against, eviction, informality, of, land, tenure, is, a, key, characteristic, of, urban, slums, at, their, start, slums, are, typically, located, in, undesirable, lands, near, the, town, or, city, that, are, state, owned, or, philanthropic, trust, owned, or, religious, entity, owned, or, have, no, clear, land, title, some, immigrants, regard, unoccupied, land, as, land, without, owners, and, therefore, occupy, it, in, some, cases, the, local, community, or, the, government, allots, lands, to, people, which, will, later, develop, into, slums, and, over, which, the, dwellers, don, t, have, property, rights, informal, land, tenure, also, includes, occupation, of, land, belonging, to, someone, else, according, to, flood, 51, percent, of, slums, are, based, on, invasion, of, private, land, in, sub, saharan, africa, 39, percent, in, north, africa, and, west, asia, 10, percent, in, south, asia, 40, percent, in, east, asia, and, 40, percent, in, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, in, some, cases, once, the, slum, has, many, residents, the, early, residents, form, a, social, group, an, informal, association, or, a, gang, that, controls, newcomers, charges, a, fee, for, the, right, to, live, in, the, slums, and, dictates, where, and, how, new, homes, get, built, within, the, slum, the, newcomers, having, paid, for, the, right, feel, they, have, commercial, right, to, the, home, in, that, slum, the, slum, dwellings, built, as, the, slum, grows, are, constructed, without, checking, land, ownership, rights, or, building, codes, are, not, registered, with, the, city, and, often, not, recognized, by, the, city, or, state, governments, secure, land, tenure, is, important, for, slum, dwellers, as, an, authentic, recognition, of, their, residential, status, in, urban, areas, it, also, encourages, them, to, upgrade, their, housing, facilities, which, will, give, them, protection, against, natural, and, unnatural, hazards, undocumented, ownership, with, no, legal, title, to, the, land, also, prevents, slum, settlers, from, applying, for, mortgage, which, might, worsen, their, financial, situations, in, addition, without, registration, of, the, land, ownership, the, government, has, difficulty, in, upgrading, basic, facilities, and, improving, the, living, environment, insecure, tenure, of, the, slum, as, well, as, a, lack, of, socially, and, politically, acceptable, alternatives, to, slums, also, creates, difficulty, in, citywide, infrastructure, development, such, as, rapid, mass, transit, electrical, and, sewer, pipe, layout, highways, and, roads, slum, areas, are, characterized, by, substandard, housing, structures, shanty, homes, are, often, built, hurriedly, on, ad, hoc, basis, with, materials, unsuitable, for, housing, often, the, construction, quality, is, inadequate, to, withstand, heavy, rains, high, winds, or, other, local, climate, and, location, paper, plastic, earthen, floors, mud, and, wattle, walls, wood, held, together, by, ropes, straw, or, torn, metal, pieces, as, roofs, are, some, of, the, materials, of, construction, in, some, cases, brick, and, cement, is, used, but, without, attention, to, proper, design, and, structural, engineering, requirements, various, space, dwelling, placement, bylaws, and, local, building, codes, may, also, be, extensively, violated, overcrowding, is, another, characteristic, of, slums, many, dwellings, are, single, room, units, with, high, occupancy, rates, each, dwelling, may, be, cohabited, by, multiple, families, five, and, more, persons, may, share, a, one, room, unit, the, room, is, used, for, cooking, sleeping, and, living, overcrowding, is, also, seen, near, sources, of, drinking, water, cleaning, and, sanitation, where, one, toilet, may, serve, dozens, of, families, in, a, slum, of, kolkata, india, over, 10, people, sometimes, share, a, 45, m, 2, room, in, kibera, slum, of, nairobi, kenya, population, density, is, estimated, at, 2, 000, people, per, hectare, or, about, 500, 000, people, in, one, square, mile, however, the, density, and, neighbourhood, effects, of, slum, populations, may, also, offer, an, opportunity, to, target, health, interventions, one, of, the, identifying, characteristics, of, slums, is, the, lack, of, or, inadequate, public, infrastructure, from, safe, drinking, water, to, electricity, from, basic, health, care, to, police, services, from, affordable, public, transport, to, fire, ambulance, services, from, sanitation, sewer, to, paved, roads, new, slums, usually, lack, all, of, these, established, old, slums, sometimes, garner, official, support, and, get, some, of, these, infrastructure, such, as, paved, roads, and, unreliable, electricity, or, water, supply, slums, usually, lack, street, addresses, which, creates, further, problems, slums, often, have, very, narrow, alleys, that, do, not, allow, vehicles, including, emergency, vehicles, to, pass, the, lack, of, services, such, as, routine, garbage, collection, allows, rubbish, to, accumulate, in, huge, quantities, the, lack, of, infrastructure, is, caused, by, the, informal, nature, of, settlement, and, no, planning, for, the, poor, by, government, officials, fires, are, often, a, serious, problem, in, many, countries, local, and, national, government, often, refuse, to, recognize, slums, because, the, slum, are, on, disputed, land, or, because, of, the, fear, that, quick, official, recognition, will, encourage, more, slum, formation, and, seizure, of, land, illegally, recognizing, and, notifying, slums, often, triggers, a, creation, of, property, rights, and, requires, that, the, government, provide, public, services, and, infrastructure, to, the, slum, residents, with, poverty, and, informal, economy, slums, do, not, generate, tax, revenues, for, the, government, and, therefore, tend, to, get, minimal, or, slow, attention, in, other, cases, the, narrow, and, haphazard, layout, of, slum, streets, houses, and, substandard, shacks, along, with, persistent, threat, of, crime, and, violence, against, infrastructure, workers, makes, it, difficult, to, layout, reliable, safe, cost, effective, and, efficient, infrastructure, in, yet, others, the, demand, far, exceeds, the, government, bureaucracy, s, ability, to, deliver, low, socioeconomic, status, of, its, residents, is, another, common, characteristic, attributed, to, slum, residents, slums, are, often, placed, in, areas, vulnerable, to, natural, disasters, such, as, landslides, and, floods, in, cities, located, in, mountainous, terrain, slums, begin, on, slopes, difficult, to, reach, or, start, at, the, bottom, of, flood, prone, valleys, often, hidden, from, plain, view, in, the, city, center, but, close, to, some, natural, water, source, in, cities, located, near, lagoons, marshlands, and, rivers, they, start, at, banks, or, on, stilts, above, water, or, the, dry, river, bed, in, flat, terrain, slums, begin, on, lands, unsuitable, for, agriculture, near, city, trash, dumps, next, to, railway, tracks, and, other, shunned, undesirable, locations, these, strategies, shield, slums, from, the, risk, of, being, noticed, and, removed, when, they, are, small, and, most, vulnerable, to, local, government, officials, however, the, ad, hoc, construction, lack, of, quality, control, on, building, materials, used, poor, maintenance, and, uncoordinated, spatial, design, make, them, prone, to, extensive, damage, during, earthquakes, as, well, from, decay, these, risks, will, be, intensified, by, climate, change, some, slums, risk, man, made, hazards, such, as, toxic, industries, traffic, congestion, and, collapsing, infrastructure, fires, are, another, major, risk, to, slums, and, its, inhabitants, with, streets, often, too, narrow, to, allow, proper, and, quick, access, to, fire, control, trucks, due, to, lack, of, skills, and, education, as, well, as, competitive, job, markets, many, slum, dwellers, face, high, rates, of, unemployment, the, limit, of, job, opportunities, causes, many, of, them, to, employ, themselves, in, the, informal, economy, inside, the, slum, or, in, developed, urban, areas, near, the, slum, this, can, sometimes, be, licit, informal, economy, or, illicit, informal, economy, without, working, contract, or, any, social, security, some, of, them, are, seeking, jobs, at, the, same, time, and, some, of, those, will, eventually, find, jobs, in, formal, economies, after, gaining, some, professional, skills, in, informal, sectors, examples, of, licit, informal, economy, include, street, vending, household, enterprises, product, assembly, and, packaging, making, garlands, and, embroideries, domestic, work, shoe, polishing, or, repair, driving, tuk, tuk, or, manual, rickshaws, construction, workers, or, manually, driven, logistics, and, handicrafts, production, in, some, slums, people, sort, and, recycle, trash, of, different, kinds, from, household, garbage, to, electronics, for, a, living, selling, either, the, odd, usable, goods, or, stripping, broken, goods, for, parts, or, raw, materials, typically, these, licit, informal, economies, require, the, poor, to, regularly, pay, a, bribe, to, local, police, and, government, officials, examples, of, illicit, informal, economy, include, illegal, substance, and, weapons, trafficking, drug, or, moonshine, changaa, production, prostitution, and, gambling, all, sources, of, risks, to, the, individual, families, and, society, recent, reports, reflecting, illicit, informal, economies, include, drug, trade, and, distribution, in, brazil, s, favelas, production, of, fake, goods, in, the, colon, as, of, tijuana, smuggling, in, katchi, abadis, and, slums, of, karachi, or, production, of, synthetic, drugs, in, the, townships, of, johannesburg, the, slum, dwellers, in, informal, economies, run, many, risks, the, informal, sector, by, its, very, nature, means, income, insecurity, and, lack, of, social, mobility, there, is, also, absence, of, legal, contracts, protection, of, labour, rights, regulations, and, bargaining, power, in, informal, employments, some, scholars, suggest, that, crime, is, one, of, the, main, concerns, in, slums, empirical, data, suggest, crime, rates, are, higher, in, some, slums, than, in, non, slums, with, slum, homicides, alone, reducing, life, expectancy, of, a, resident, in, a, brazil, slum, by, 7, years, than, for, a, resident, in, nearby, non, slum, in, some, countries, like, venezuela, officials, have, sent, in, the, military, to, control, slum, criminal, violence, involved, with, drugs, and, weapons, rape, is, another, serious, issue, related, to, crime, in, slums, in, nairobi, slums, for, example, one, fourth, of, all, teenage, girls, are, raped, each, year, on, the, other, hand, while, un, habitat, reports, some, slums, are, more, exposed, to, crimes, with, higher, crime, rates, for, instance, the, traditional, inner, city, slums, crime, is, not, the, direct, resultant, of, block, layout, in, many, slums, rather, crime, is, one, of, the, symptoms, of, slum, dwelling, thus, slums, consist, of, more, victims, than, criminals, consequently, slums, in, all, do, not, have, consistently, high, crime, rates, slums, have, the, worst, crime, rates, in, sectors, maintaining, influence, of, illicit, economy, such, as, drug, trafficking, brewing, prostitution, and, gambling, often, in, such, circumstance, multiple, gangs, fight, for, control, over, revenue, slum, crime, rate, correlates, with, insufficient, law, enforcement, and, inadequate, public, policing, in, main, cities, of, developing, countries, law, enforcement, lags, behind, urban, growth, and, slum, expansion, often, police, can, not, reduce, crime, because, due, to, ineffective, city, planning, and, governance, slums, set, inefficient, crime, prevention, system, such, problems, is, not, primarily, due, to, community, indifference, leads, and, information, intelligence, from, slums, are, rare, streets, are, narrow, and, a, potential, death, traps, to, patrol, and, many, in, the, slum, community, have, an, inherent, distrust, of, authorities, from, fear, ranging, from, eviction, to, collection, on, unpaid, utility, bills, to, general, law, and, order, lack, of, formal, recognition, by, the, governments, also, leads, to, few, formal, policing, and, public, justice, institutions, in, slums, women, in, slums, are, at, greater, risk, of, physical, and, sexual, violence, factors, such, as, unemployment, that, lead, to, insufficient, resources, in, the, household, can, increase, marital, stress, and, therefore, exacerbate, domestic, violence, slums, are, often, non, secured, areas, and, women, often, risk, sexual, violence, when, they, walk, alone, in, slums, late, at, night, violence, against, women, and, women, s, security, in, slums, emerge, as, recurrent, issues, another, prevalent, form, of, violence, in, slums, is, armed, violence, gun, violence, mostly, existing, in, african, and, latin, american, slums, it, leads, to, homicide, and, the, emergence, of, criminal, gangs, typical, victims, are, male, slum, residents, violence, often, leads, to, retaliatory, and, vigilante, violence, within, the, slum, gang, and, drug, wars, are, endemic, in, some, slums, predominantly, between, male, residents, of, slums, the, police, sometimes, participate, in, gender, based, violence, against, men, as, well, by, picking, up, some, men, beating, them, and, putting, them, in, jail, domestic, violence, against, men, also, exists, in, slums, including, verbal, abuses, and, even, physical, violence, from, households, cohen, as, well, as, merton, theorized, that, the, cycle, of, slum, violence, does, not, mean, slums, are, inevitably, criminogenic, rather, in, some, cases, it, is, frustration, against, life, in, slum, and, a, consequence, of, denial, of, opportunity, to, slum, residents, to, leave, the, slum, further, crime, rates, are, not, uniformly, high, in, world, s, slums, the, highest, crime, rates, in, slums, are, seen, where, illicit, economy, such, as, drug, trafficking, brewing, prostitution, and, gambling, is, strong, and, multiple, gangs, are, fighting, for, control, slum, dwellers, usually, experience, a, high, rate, of, disease, diseases, that, have, been, reported, in, slums, include, cholera, hiv, aids, measles, malaria, dengue, typhoid, drug, resistant, tuberculosis, and, other, epidemics, studies, focus, on, children, s, health, in, slums, address, that, cholera, and, diarrhea, are, especially, common, among, young, children, besides, children, s, vulnerability, to, diseases, many, scholars, also, focus, on, high, hiv, aids, prevalence, in, slums, among, women, throughout, slum, areas, in, various, parts, of, the, world, infectious, diseases, are, a, significant, contributor, to, high, mortality, rates, for, example, according, to, a, study, in, nairobi, s, slums, hiv, aids, and, tuberculosis, attributed, to, about, 50, of, the, mortality, burden, factors, that, have, been, attributed, to, a, higher, rate, of, disease, transmission, in, slums, include, high, population, densities, poor, living, conditions, low, vaccination, rates, insufficient, health, related, data, and, inadequate, health, service, overcrowding, leads, to, faster, and, wider, spread, of, diseases, due, to, the, limited, space, in, slum, housing, poor, living, conditions, also, make, slum, dwellers, more, vulnerable, to, certain, diseases, poor, water, quality, a, manifest, example, is, a, cause, of, many, major, illnesses, including, malaria, diarrhea, and, trachoma, improving, living, conditions, such, as, introduction, of, better, sanitation, and, access, to, basic, facilities, can, ameliorate, the, effects, of, diseases, such, as, cholera, slums, have, been, historically, linked, to, epidemics, and, this, trend, has, continued, in, modern, times, for, example, the, slums, of, west, african, nations, such, as, liberia, were, crippled, by, as, well, as, contributed, to, the, outbreak, and, spread, of, ebola, in, 2014, slums, are, considered, a, major, public, health, concern, and, potential, breeding, grounds, of, drug, resistant, diseases, for, the, entire, city, the, nation, as, well, as, the, global, community, child, malnutrition, is, more, common, in, slums, than, in, non, slum, areas, in, mumbai, and, new, delhi, 47, and, 51, of, slum, children, under, the, age, of, five, are, stunted, and, 35, and, 36, of, them, are, underweighted, these, children, all, suffer, from, third, degree, malnutrition, the, most, severe, level, according, to, who, standards, a, study, conducted, by, tada, et, al, in, bangkok, slums, illustrates, that, in, terms, of, weight, forage, 25, 4, of, the, children, who, participated, in, the, survey, suffered, from, malnutrition, compared, to, around, 8, national, malnutrition, prevalence, in, thailand, in, ethiopia, and, the, niger, rates, of, child, malnutrition, in, urban, slums, are, around, 40, the, major, nutritional, problems, in, slums, are, protein, energy, malnutrition, pem, vitamin, a, deficiency, vad, iron, deficiency, anemia, ida, and, iodine, deficiency, disorders, idd, malnutrition, can, sometimes, lead, to, death, among, children, dr, abhay, bang, s, report, shows, that, malnutrition, kills, 56, 000, children, annually, in, urban, slums, in, india, widespread, child, malnutrition, in, slums, is, closely, related, to, family, income, mothers, food, practice, mothers, educational, level, and, maternal, employment, or, housewifery, poverty, may, result, in, inadequate, food, intake, when, people, cannot, afford, to, buy, and, store, enough, food, which, leads, to, malnutrition, another, common, cause, is, mothers, faulty, feeding, practices, including, inadequate, breastfeeding, and, wrongly, preparation, of, food, for, children, tada, et, al, s, study, in, bangkok, slums, shows, that, around, 64, of, the, mothers, sometimes, fed, their, children, instant, food, instead, of, a, normal, meal, and, about, 70, of, the, mothers, did, not, provide, their, children, three, meals, every, day, mothers, lack, of, education, leads, to, their, faulty, feeding, practices, many, mothers, in, slums, don, t, have, knowledge, on, food, nutrition, for, children, maternal, employment, also, influences, children, s, nutritional, status, for, the, mothers, who, work, outside, their, children, are, prone, to, be, malnourished, these, children, are, likely, to, be, neglected, by, their, mothers, or, sometimes, not, carefully, looked, after, by, their, female, relatives, a, multitude, of, non, contagious, diseases, also, impact, health, for, slum, residents, examples, of, prevalent, non, infectious, diseases, include, cardiovascular, disease, diabetes, chronic, respiratory, disease, neurological, disorders, and, mental, illness, in, some, slum, areas, of, india, diarrhea, is, a, significant, health, problem, among, children, factors, like, poor, sanitation, low, literacy, rates, and, limited, awareness, make, diarrhea, and, other, dangerous, diseases, extremely, prevalent, and, burdensome, on, the, community, lack, of, reliable, data, also, has, a, negative, impact, on, slum, dwellers, health, a, number, of, slum, families, do, not, report, cases, or, seek, professional, medical, care, which, results, in, insufficient, data, this, might, prevent, appropriate, allocation, of, health, care, resources, in, slum, areas, since, many, countries, base, their, health, care, plans, on, data, from, clinic, hospital, or, national, mortality, registry, moreover, health, service, is, insufficient, or, inadequate, in, most, of, the, world, s, slums, emergency, ambulance, service, and, urgent, care, services, are, typically, unavailable, as, health, service, providers, sometimes, avoid, servicing, slums, a, study, shows, that, more, than, half, of, slum, dwellers, are, prone, to, visit, private, practitioners, or, seek, self, medication, with, medicines, available, in, the, home, private, practitioners, in, slums, are, usually, those, who, are, unlicensed, or, poorly, trained, and, they, run, clinics, and, pharmacies, mainly, for, the, sake, of, money, the, categorization, of, slum, health, by, the, government, and, census, data, also, has, an, effect, on, the, distribution, and, allocation, of, health, resources, in, inner, city, areas, a, significant, portion, of, city, populations, face, challenges, with, access, to, health, care, but, do, not, live, in, locations, that, are, described, as, within, the, slum, area, overall, a, complex, network, of, physical, social, and, environmental, factors, contribute, to, the, health, threats, faced, by, slum, residents, recent, years, have, seen, a, dramatic, growth, in, the, number, of, slums, as, urban, populations, have, increased, in, developing, countries, nearly, a, billion, people, worldwide, live, in, slums, and, some, project, the, figure, may, grow, to, 2, billion, by, 2030, if, governments, and, the, global, community, ignore, slums, and, continue, current, urban, policies, united, nations, habitat, group, believes, change, is, possible, some, ngo, s, are, focused, at, addressing, local, problems, i, e, sanitation, issues, health, through, the, mapping, out, of, the, slums, and, its, health, services, creation, of, latrines, creation, of, local, food, production, projects, and, even, microcredit, projects, in, one, project, in, rio, de, janeiro, the, government, even, employed, slum, residents, for, the, reforestation, of, a, nearby, location, to, achieve, the, goal, of, cities, without, slums, the, un, claims, that, governments, must, undertake, vigorous, urban, planning, city, management, infrastructure, development, slum, upgrading, and, poverty, reduction, some, city, and, state, officials, have, simply, sought, to, remove, slums, this, strategy, for, dealing, with, slums, is, rooted, in, the, fact, that, slums, typically, start, illegally, on, someone, else, s, land, property, and, they, are, not, recognized, by, the, state, as, the, slum, started, by, violating, another, s, property, rights, the, residents, have, no, legal, claim, to, the, land, critics, argue, that, slum, removal, by, force, tend, to, ignore, the, social, problems, that, cause, slums, the, poor, children, as, well, as, working, adults, of, a, city, s, informal, economy, need, a, place, to, live, slum, clearance, removes, the, slum, but, it, does, not, remove, the, causes, that, create, and, maintain, the, slum, policymakers, urban, planners, and, politicians, need, to, take, the, factors, that, cause, people, to, live, in, informal, housing, into, consideration, while, tackling, the, issue, of, slums, slum, relocation, strategies, rely, on, removing, the, slums, and, relocating, the, slum, poor, to, free, semi, rural, peripheries, of, cities, sometimes, in, free, housing, an, example, of, this, is, the, governmental, program, in, morocco, called, cities, without, shantytowns, sometimes, referred, to, as, cities, without, slums, or, in, french, villes, sans, bidonvilles, which, was, launched, to, put, an, end, to, informal, housing, and, resettle, the, communities, in, slums, into, apartments, this, strategy, ignores, several, dimensions, of, a, slum, life, the, strategy, sees, slum, as, merely, a, place, where, the, poor, lives, in, reality, slums, are, often, integrated, with, every, aspect, of, a, slum, resident, s, life, including, sources, of, employment, distance, from, work, and, social, life, slum, relocation, that, displaces, the, poor, from, opportunities, to, earn, a, livelihood, generates, economic, insecurity, in, the, poor, in, some, cases, the, slum, residents, oppose, relocation, even, if, the, replacement, land, and, housing, to, the, outskirts, of, cities, is, of, better, quality, than, their, current, house, examples, include, zone, one, tondo, organization, of, manila, philippines, and, abahlali, base, mjondolo, of, durban, south, africa, in, other, cases, such, as, ennakhil, slum, relocation, project, in, morocco, systematic, social, mediation, has, worked, the, slum, residents, have, been, convinced, that, their, current, location, is, a, health, hazard, prone, to, natural, disaster, or, that, the, alternative, location, is, well, connected, to, employment, opportunities, some, governments, have, begun, to, approach, slums, as, a, possible, opportunity, to, urban, development, by, slum, upgrading, this, approach, was, inspired, in, part, by, the, theoretical, writings, of, john, turner, in, 1972, the, approach, seeks, to, upgrade, the, slum, with, basic, infrastructure, such, as, sanitation, safe, drinking, water, safe, electricity, distribution, paved, roads, rain, water, drainage, system, and, bus, metro, stops, the, assumption, behind, this, approach, is, that, if, slums, are, given, basic, services, and, tenure, security, that, is, the, slum, will, not, be, destroyed, and, slum, residents, will, not, be, evicted, then, the, residents, will, rebuild, their, own, housing, engage, their, slum, community, to, live, better, and, over, time, attract, investment, from, government, organizations, and, businesses, turner, argued, not, to, demolish, the, housing, but, to, improve, the, environment, if, governments, can, clear, existing, slums, of, unsanitary, human, waste, polluted, water, and, litter, and, from, muddy, unlit, lanes, they, do, not, have, to, worry, about, the, shanty, housing, squatters, have, shown, great, organizational, skills, in, terms, of, land, management, and, they, will, maintain, the, infrastructure, that, is, provided, in, mexico, city, for, example, the, government, attempted, to, upgrade, and, urbanize, settled, slums, in, the, periphery, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, by, including, basic, amenities, such, as, concrete, roads, parks, illumination, and, sewage, currently, most, slums, in, mexico, city, face, basic, characteristics, of, traditional, slums, characterized, to, some, extent, in, housing, population, density, crime, and, poverty, however, the, vast, majority, of, its, inhabitants, have, access, to, basic, amenities, and, most, areas, are, connected, to, major, roads, and, completely, urbanized, nevertheless, smaller, settlements, lacking, these, can, still, be, found, in, the, periphery, of, the, city, and, its, inhabitants, are, known, as, paracaidistas, a, more, recent, example, of, slum, upgrading, approach, is, primed, initiative, in, medellin, colombia, where, streets, metrocable, transportation, and, other, public, infrastructure, has, been, added, these, slum, infrastructure, upgrades, were, combined, with, city, infrastructure, upgrade, such, as, addition, of, metro, paved, roads, and, highways, to, empower, all, city, residents, including, the, poor, with, reliable, access, throughout, city, most, slum, upgrading, projects, however, have, produced, mixed, results, while, initial, evaluations, were, promising, and, success, stories, widely, reported, by, media, evaluations, done, 5, to, 10, years, after, a, project, completion, have, been, disappointing, herbert, werlin, notes, that, the, initial, benefits, of, slum, upgrading, efforts, have, been, ephemeral, the, slum, upgrading, projects, in, kampungs, of, jakarta, indonesia, for, example, looked, promising, in, first, few, years, after, upgrade, but, thereafter, returned, to, a, condition, worse, than, before, particularly, in, terms, of, sanitation, environmental, problems, and, safety, of, drinking, water, communal, toilets, provided, under, slum, upgrading, effort, were, poorly, maintained, and, abandoned, by, slum, residents, of, jakarta, similarly, slum, upgrading, efforts, in, philippines, india, and, brazil, have, proven, to, be, excessively, more, expensive, than, initially, estimated, and, the, condition, of, the, slums, 10, years, after, completion, of, slum, upgrading, has, been, slum, like, the, anticipated, benefits, of, slum, upgrading, claims, werlin, have, proven, to, be, a, myth, there, is, limited, but, consistent, evidence, that, slums, upgrading, may, prevent, diarrhoeal, diseases, and, water, related, expenditure, slum, upgrading, is, largely, a, government, controlled, funded, and, run, process, rather, than, a, competitive, market, driven, process, krueckeberg, and, paulsen, note, conflicting, politics, government, corruption, and, street, violence, in, slum, regularization, process, is, part, of, the, reality, slum, upgrading, and, tenure, regularization, also, upgrade, and, regularize, the, slum, bosses, and, political, agendas, while, threatening, the, influence, and, power, of, municipal, officials, and, ministries, slum, upgrading, does, not, address, poverty, low, paying, jobs, from, informal, economy, and, other, characteristics, of, slums, recent, research, shows, that, the, lack, of, these, options, make, residents, to, undertake, measures, to, assure, their, working, needs, one, example, in, the, northeast, of, brazil, vila, s, pedro, was, mischaracterized, by, informal, self, constructions, by, residents, to, restore, working, opportunities, originally, employed, in, the, informal, settlement, it, is, unclear, whether, slum, upgrading, can, lead, to, long, term, sustainable, improvement, to, slums, urban, infrastructure, such, as, reliable, high, speed, mass, transit, system, motorways, interstates, and, public, housing, projects, have, been, cited, as, responsible, for, the, disappearance, of, major, slums, in, the, united, states, and, europe, from, the, 1960s, through, 1970s, charles, pearson, argued, in, uk, parliament, that, mass, transit, would, enable, london, to, reduce, slums, and, relocate, slum, dwellers, his, proposal, was, initially, rejected, for, lack, of, land, and, other, reasons, but, pearson, and, others, persisted, with, creative, proposals, such, as, building, the, mass, transit, under, the, major, roads, already, in, use, and, owned, by, the, city, london, underground, was, born, and, its, expansion, has, been, credited, to, reducing, slums, in, respective, cities, and, to, an, extent, the, new, york, city, subway, s, smaller, expansion, as, cities, expanded, and, business, parks, scattered, due, to, cost, ineffectiveness, people, moved, to, live, in, the, suburbs, thus, retail, logistics, house, maintenance, and, other, businesses, followed, demand, patterns, city, governments, used, infrastructure, investments, and, urban, planning, to, distribute, work, housing, green, areas, retail, schools, and, population, densities, affordable, public, mass, transit, in, cities, such, as, new, york, city, london, and, paris, allowed, the, poor, to, reach, areas, where, they, could, earn, a, livelihood, public, and, council, housing, projects, cleared, slums, and, provided, more, sanitary, housing, options, than, what, existed, before, the, 1950s, slum, clearance, became, a, priority, policy, in, europe, between, 1950, 1970s, and, one, of, the, biggest, state, led, programs, in, the, uk, the, slum, clearance, effort, was, bigger, in, scale, than, the, formation, of, british, railways, the, national, health, service, and, other, state, programs, uk, government, data, suggests, the, clearances, that, took, place, after, 1955, demolished, about, 1, 5, million, slum, properties, resettling, about, 15, of, uk, s, population, out, of, these, properties, similarly, after, 1950, denmark, and, others, pursued, parallel, initiatives, to, clear, slums, and, resettle, the, slum, residents, the, us, and, european, governments, additionally, created, a, procedure, by, which, the, poor, could, directly, apply, to, the, government, for, housing, assistance, thus, becoming, a, partner, to, identifying, and, meeting, the, housing, needs, of, its, citizens, one, historically, effective, approach, to, reduce, and, prevent, slums, has, been, citywide, infrastructure, development, combined, with, affordable, reliable, public, mass, transport, and, public, housing, projects, however, slum, relocation, in, the, name, of, urban, development, is, criticized, for, uprooting, communities, without, consultation, or, consideration, of, ongoing, livelihood, for, example, the, sabarmati, riverfront, project, a, recreational, development, in, ahmedabad, india, forcefully, relocated, over, 19, 000, families, from, shacks, along, the, river, to, 13, public, housing, complexes, that, were, an, average, of, 9, km, away, from, the, family, s, original, dwelling, slums, exist, in, many, countries, and, have, become, a, global, phenomenon, a, un, habitat, report, states, that, in, 2006, there, were, nearly, 1, billion, people, settling, in, slum, settlements, in, most, cities, of, central, america, asia, south, america, and, africa, and, a, smaller, number, in, the, cities, of, europe, and, north, america, in, 2012, according, to, un, habitat, about, 863, million, people, in, the, developing, world, lived, in, slums, of, these, the, urban, slum, population, at, mid, year, was, around, 213, million, in, sub, saharan, africa, 207, million, in, east, asia, 201, million, in, south, asia, 113, million, in, latin, america, and, caribbean, 80, million, in, southeast, asia, 36, million, in, west, asia, and, 13, million, in, north, africa, 127, among, individual, countries, the, proportion, of, urban, residents, living, in, slum, areas, in, 2009, was, highest, in, the, central, african, republic, 95, 9, chad, 89, 3, niger, 81, 7, and, mozambique, 80, 5, the, distribution, of, slums, within, a, city, varies, throughout, the, world, in, most, of, the, developed, countries, it, is, easier, to, distinguish, the, slum, areas, and, non, slum, areas, in, the, united, states, slum, dwellers, are, usually, in, city, neighborhoods, and, inner, suburbs, while, in, europe, they, are, more, common, in, high, rise, housing, on, the, urban, outskirts, in, many, developing, countries, slums, are, prevalent, as, distributed, pockets, or, as, urban, orbits, of, densely, constructed, informal, settlements, in, some, cities, especially, in, countries, in, south, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, slums, are, not, just, marginalized, neighborhoods, holding, a, small, population, slums, are, widespread, and, are, home, to, a, large, part, of, urban, population, these, are, sometimes, called, slum, cities, the, percentage, of, developing, world, s, urban, population, living, in, slums, has, been, dropping, with, economic, development, even, while, total, urban, population, has, been, increasing, in, 1990, 46, percent, of, the, urban, population, lived, in, slums, by, 2000, the, percentage, had, dropped, to, 39, which, further, dropped, to, 32, by, 2010
