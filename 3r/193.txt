the, murray, river, in, south, australia, river, murray, ngarrindjeri, millewa, yorta, yorta, dhungala, tongala, is, a, river, in, southeastern, australia, it, is, australia, s, longest, river, at, 2, 508, km, 1, 558, mi, extent, its, tributaries, include, five, of, the, next, six, longest, rivers, of, australia, the, murrumbidgee, darling, lachlan, warrego, and, paroo, rivers, together, with, that, of, the, murray, the, catchments, of, these, rivers, form, the, murray, darling, basin, which, covers, about, one, seventh, the, area, of, australia, it, is, widely, considered, australia, s, most, important, irrigated, region, the, murray, rises, in, the, australian, alps, draining, the, western, side, of, australia, s, highest, mountains, then, meanders, northwest, across, australia, s, inland, plains, forming, the, border, between, the, states, of, new, south, wales, and, victoria, as, it, flows, into, south, australia, from, an, east, west, direction, it, turns, south, at, morgan, for, its, final, 315, km, 196, mi, reaching, the, eastern, edge, of, lake, alexandrina, which, fluctuates, in, salinity, the, water, then, flows, through, several, channels, around, hindmarsh, island, and, mundoo, island, there, it, is, joined, by, lagoon, water, from, the, coorong, to, the, south, east, before, emptying, into, the, great, australian, bight, often, referenced, on, australian, maps, as, the, southern, ocean, through, the, murray, mouth, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, east, of, goolwa, south, despite, discharging, considerable, volumes, of, water, at, times, particularly, before, the, advent, of, large, scale, river, regulation, the, waters, at, the, murray, mouth, are, almost, invariably, slow, and, shallow, as, of, 2010, the, murray, river, system, received, 58, per, cent, of, its, natural, flow, the, figure, varies, considerably, the, border, between, victoria, and, new, south, wales, nsw, lies, along, the, top, of, the, southern, or, left, bank, of, the, murray, river, the, murray, forms, part, of, the, 3, 750, km, 2, 330, mi, long, combined, murray, darling, river, system, that, drains, most, of, the, inland, of, victoria, new, south, wales, and, the, southern, part, of, queensland, the, murray, carries, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, water, of, comparably, sized, rivers, in, other, parts, of, the, world, and, with, great, annual, variability, of, its, flow, it, has, dried, up, completely, during, extreme, droughts, on, three, occasions, since, official, record, keeping, began, more, often, a, sandbar, formed, at, the, mouth, and, stopped, the, flow, the, murray, is, the, border, between, new, south, wales, and, victoria, specifically, at, the, top, of, the, bank, of, the, victorian, side, of, the, river, in, a, 1980, judgement, the, high, court, of, australia, ruled, on, the, question, as, to, which, state, had, jurisdiction, in, the, unlawful, death, of, a, man, who, was, fishing, by, the, river, s, edge, on, the, victorian, side, of, the, river, this, boundary, definition, can, be, ambiguous, since, the, river, changes, its, course, over, time, and, some, of, the, river, banks, have, been, modified, for, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, west, of, the, line, of, longitude, 141, e, the, border, is, between, victoria, and, south, australia, in, the, middle, of, the, river, the, discrepancy, was, caused, during, the, 1840s, when, the, border, was, originally, surveyed, by, an, east, west, miscalculation, of, 3, 72, kilometres, 2, 31, miles, west, of, this, sector, the, murray, is, entirely, within, the, state, of, south, australia, major, settlements, along, the, course, of, the, river, from, its, source, to, the, southern, ocean, and, their, populations, from, the, 2016, australian, census, are, as, follows, the, murray, and, its, tributaries, support, a, variety, of, river, life, adapted, to, its, vagaries, this, includes, native, fish, such, as, the, famous, murray, cod, trout, cod, golden, perch, macquarie, perch, silver, perch, eel, tailed, catfish, australian, smelt, and, western, carp, gudgeon, as, well, as, other, aquatic, species, such, as, the, murray, short, necked, turtle, broad, clawed, yabbies, and, the, large, clawed, macrobrachium, shrimp, in, addition, to, aquatic, species, more, widely, distributed, through, southeastern, australia, such, as, common, long, necked, turtles, common, yabbies, the, small, claw, less, paratya, shrimp, water, rats, and, platypus, the, murray, crayfish, an, endangered, species, was, able, to, increase, its, numbers, thanks, to, scientists, the, murray, also, supports, fringeing, corridors, and, forests, of, the, river, red, gum, the, health, of, the, murray, has, declined, significantly, since, european, settlement, particularly, through, regulation, of, its, flows, extreme, droughts, between, 2000, and, 2007, put, significant, stress, on, river, red, gum, forests, leading, to, mounting, concern, over, their, long, term, survival, the, murray, has, also, flooded, on, occasion, the, most, significant, was, the, flood, of, 1956, lasting, for, up, to, six, months, it, inundated, many, towns, on, its, lower, reaches, in, south, australia, between, 2, 5, and, 0, 5, million, years, ago, the, murray, terminated, in, a, vast, freshwater, lake, lake, bungunnia, formed, by, earth, movements, that, blocked, the, river, near, swan, reach, at, its, maximum, extent, lake, bungunnia, covered, 33, 000, km, 2, 12, 741, sq, mi, extending, to, near, the, menindee, lakes, in, the, north, and, to, near, boundary, bend, in, the, south, the, draining, of, lake, bungunnia, occurred, approximately, 600, 000, years, ago, deep, clays, deposited, by, the, lake, are, evident, in, cliffs, around, chowilla, in, south, australia, considerably, higher, rainfall, would, have, been, required, to, keep, such, a, lake, full, the, draining, of, lake, bungunnia, appears, to, have, marked, the, end, of, a, wet, phase, in, the, history, of, the, murray, darling, basin, and, the, onset, of, widespread, arid, conditions, similar, to, today, a, species, of, neoceratodus, lungfish, existed, in, lake, bungunnia, today, neoceratodus, lungfish, are, only, found, in, several, queensland, rivers, the, noted, barmah, river, red, gum, forests, owe, their, existence, to, the, cadell, fault, about, 25, 000, years, ago, displacement, occurred, along, this, fault, raising, its, eastern, edge, which, runs, north, south, 8, to, 12, m, 26, to, 39, ft, above, the, floodplain, this, created, a, complex, series, of, events, a, section, of, the, original, murray, river, channel, immediately, behind, the, fault, was, rendered, abandoned, it, exists, today, as, an, empty, channel, known, as, green, gully, the, goulburn, river, was, dammed, by, the, southern, end, of, the, fault, to, create, a, natural, lake, the, murray, river, flowed, to, the, north, around, the, cadell, fault, creating, the, channel, of, the, edward, river, which, exists, today, and, through, which, much, of, the, murray, s, waters, still, flow, then, the, natural, dam, on, the, goulburn, river, failed, the, lake, drained, and, the, murray, changed, its, course, to, the, south, and, started, to, flow, through, the, smaller, goulburn, river, channel, creating, the, barmah, choke, and, the, narrows, where, the, river, channel, is, unusually, narrow, before, entering, into, the, proper, murray, river, channel, again, the, primary, result, of, the, cadell, fault, that, the, west, flowing, water, of, the, murray, river, strikes, the, north, south, fault, and, diverts, both, north, and, south, around, the, fault, in, the, two, main, channels, edward, and, ancestral, goulburn, in, addition, to, a, fan, of, small, streams, and, regularly, floods, a, large, amount, of, low, lying, country, in, the, area, these, conditions, are, perfect, for, river, red, gums, which, rapidly, formed, forests, in, the, area, thus, the, displacement, of, the, cadell, fault, 25, 000, bp, led, directly, to, the, formation, of, the, famous, barmah, river, red, gum, forests, the, barmah, choke, and, the, narrows, restrict, the, amount, of, water, that, can, travel, down, this, part, of, the, murray, in, times, of, flood, and, high, irrigation, flows, the, majority, of, the, water, in, addition, to, flooding, the, red, gum, forests, actually, travels, through, the, edward, river, channel, the, murray, has, not, had, enough, flow, power, to, naturally, enlarge, the, barmah, choke, and, the, narrows, to, increase, the, amount, of, water, they, can, carry, the, cadell, fault, is, quite, noticeable, as, a, continuous, low, earthen, embankment, as, one, drives, into, barmah, from, the, west, although, to, the, untrained, eye, it, may, appear, man, made, the, murray, mouth, is, the, point, at, which, the, murray, river, empties, into, the, sea, and, the, interaction, between, its, shallow, shifting, and, variable, currents, and, the, open, sea, can, be, complex, and, unpredictable, during, the, peak, period, of, murray, river, commerce, roughly, 1855, to, 1920, it, presented, a, major, impediment, to, the, passage, of, goods, and, produce, between, adelaide, and, the, murray, settlements, and, many, vessels, foundered, or, were, wrecked, there, since, the, early, 2000s, dredging, machines, have, operated, at, the, murray, mouth, for, 24, hours, a, day, moving, sand, from, the, channel, to, maintain, a, minimal, flow, from, the, sea, and, into, the, coorong, s, lagoon, system, without, the, dredging, the, mouth, would, silt, up, and, close, cutting, the, supply, of, fresh, sea, water, into, the, coorong, national, park, which, would, then, warm, up, stagnate, and, die, being, one, of, the, major, river, systems, on, one, of, the, driest, continents, on, earth, the, murray, has, significant, cultural, relevance, to, aboriginal, australians, according, to, the, people, of, lake, alexandrina, the, murray, was, created, by, the, tracks, of, the, great, ancestor, ngurunderi, as, he, pursued, pondi, the, murray, cod, the, chase, originated, in, the, interior, of, new, south, wales, ngurunderi, pursued, the, fish, who, like, many, totem, animals, in, aboriginal, myths, is, often, portrayed, as, a, man, on, rafts, or, lala, made, from, red, gums, and, continually, launched, spears, at, his, target, but, pondi, was, a, wily, prey, and, carved, a, weaving, path, carving, out, the, river, s, various, tributaries, ngurunderi, was, forced, to, beach, his, rafts, and, often, create, new, ones, as, he, changed, from, reach, to, reach, of, the, river, at, kobathatang, ngurunderi, finally, got, lucky, and, struck, pondi, in, the, tail, with, a, spear, however, the, shock, to, the, fish, was, so, great, it, launched, him, forward, in, a, straight, line, to, a, place, called, peindjalang, near, tailem, bend, eager, to, rectify, his, failure, to, catch, his, prey, the, hunter, and, his, two, wives, sometimes, the, escaped, sibling, wives, of, waku, and, kanu, hurried, on, and, took, positions, high, on, the, cliff, on, which, tailem, bend, now, stands, they, sprung, an, ambush, on, pondi, only, to, fail, again, ngurunderi, set, off, in, pursuit, again, but, lost, his, prey, as, pondi, dived, into, lake, alexandrina, ngurunderi, and, the, women, settled, on, the, shore, only, to, suffer, bad, luck, with, fishing, being, plagued, by, a, water, fiend, known, as, muldjewangk, they, later, moved, to, a, more, suitable, spot, at, the, site, of, present, day, ashville, the, twin, summits, of, mount, misery, are, said, to, be, the, remnants, of, his, rafts, they, are, known, as, lalangengall, or, the, two, watercraft, this, story, of, a, hunter, pursuing, a, murray, cod, that, carved, out, the, murray, persists, in, numerous, forms, in, various, language, groups, that, inhabit, the, enormous, area, spanned, by, the, murray, system, the, wotojobaluk, people, of, victoria, tell, of, totyerguil, from, the, area, now, known, as, swan, hill, who, ran, out, of, spears, while, chasing, otchtout, the, cod, roonka, flat, near, blanchetown, was, a, site, of, occupation, since, at, least, 7000bc, the, first, europeans, to, encounter, the, river, were, hamilton, hume, and, william, hovell, who, crossed, the, river, where, albury, now, stands, in, 1824, hume, named, it, the, hume, river, after, his, father, in, 1830, captain, charles, sturt, reached, the, river, after, travelling, down, its, tributary, the, murrumbidgee, river, and, named, it, the, murray, river, in, honour, of, the, then, british, secretary, of, state, for, war, and, the, colonies, sir, george, murray, not, realising, it, was, the, same, river, that, hume, and, hovell, had, encountered, further, upstream, sturt, continued, down, the, remaining, length, of, the, murray, to, finally, reach, lake, alexandrina, and, the, river, s, mouth, the, vicinity, of, the, murray, mouth, was, explored, more, thoroughly, by, captain, collet, barker, in, 1831, the, first, three, settlers, on, the, murray, river, are, known, to, have, been, james, collins, hawker, explorer, and, surveyor, along, with, edward, john, eyre, explorer, and, later, governor, of, jamaica, plus, e, b, scott, onetime, superintendent, of, yatala, labour, prison, hawker, is, known, to, have, sold, his, share, in, the, bungaree, station, which, he, founded, with, his, brothers, and, relocated, alongside, the, murray, at, a, site, near, moorundie, in, 1852, francis, cadell, in, preparation, for, the, launch, of, his, steamer, service, explored, the, river, in, a, canvas, boat, travelling, 1, 300, miles, 2, 100, km, downstream, from, swan, hill, in, 1858, while, acting, as, minister, of, land, and, works, for, new, south, wales, irish, nationalist, and, founder, of, young, ireland, charles, gavan, duffy, founded, carlyle, township, on, the, murray, river, after, his, close, friend, scottish, historian, and, essayist, thomas, carlyle, included, in, the, township, were, jane, street, named, in, honour, of, carlyle, s, wife, jane, carlyle, and, stuart, mill, street, in, honour, of, political, philosopher, john, stuart, mill, in, 1858, the, government, zoologist, william, blandowski, together, with, gerard, krefft, explored, the, lower, reaches, of, the, murray, and, darling, rivers, compiling, a, list, of, birds, and, mammals, george, chinese, morrison, then, aged, 18, navigated, the, river, by, canoe, from, wodonga, to, its, mouth, in, 65, days, completing, the, 1, 555, mile, 2, 503, km, journey, in, january, 1881, shipping, cannot, enter, the, murray, from, the, sea, because, it, does, not, have, an, estuary, however, in, the, 19th, century, the, river, supported, a, substantial, commercial, trade, using, shallow, draft, paddle, steamers, the, first, trips, being, made, by, two, boats, from, south, australia, on, the, spring, flood, of, 1853, the, lady, augusta, captained, by, francis, cadell, reached, swan, hill, while, another, mary, ann, captained, by, william, randell, reached, moama, near, echuca, in, 1855, a, steamer, carrying, gold, mining, supplies, reached, albury, but, echuca, was, the, usual, turn, around, point, though, small, boats, continued, to, link, with, up, river, ports, such, as, tocumwal, wahgunyah, and, albury, the, arrival, of, steamboat, transport, was, welcomed, by, pastoralists, who, had, been, suffering, from, a, shortage, of, transport, due, to, the, demands, of, the, gold, fields, by, 1860, a, dozen, steamers, were, operating, in, the, high, water, season, along, the, murray, and, its, tributaries, once, the, railway, reached, echuca, in, 1864, the, bulk, of, the, woolclip, from, the, riverina, was, transported, via, river, to, echuca, and, then, south, to, melbourne, the, steam, paddleship, etona, was, launched, as, a, mission, steamer, replacing, an, earlier, steam, launch, also, named, etona, which, had, been, operating, on, the, murray, since, 1891, the, vessel, was, based, at, murray, bridge, and, operated, between, goolwa, and, the, victorian, border, stopping, at, towns, such, as, mannum, morgan, and, renmark, as, well, as, isolated, settlements, and, workcamps, the, forepart, of, the, vessel, was, used, a, chapel, fitted, with, an, altar, and, organ, with, a, capacity, of, 20, people, there, was, also, a, cabin, the, minister, onboard, rev, william, bussell, doubled, as, captain, on, 16, august, 1898, etona, arrived, at, renmark, where, the, bishop, of, adelaide, rev, dr, john, harmer, held, services, the, following, sunday, with, the, assistance, of, rev, h, m, wylie, in, september, of, the, same, year, the, service, due, in, holder, on, the, 18th, was, suspended, due, to, the, vessel, grounding, on, a, sandbank, during, its, year, of, launch, the, boiler, of, etona, gave, way, being, replaced, at, a, cost, of, 87, the, murray, was, plagued, by, snags, fallen, trees, submerged, in, the, water, and, considerable, efforts, were, made, to, clear, the, river, of, these, threats, to, shipping, by, using, barges, equipped, with, steam, driven, winches, in, recent, times, efforts, have, been, made, to, restore, many, of, these, snags, by, placing, dead, gum, trees, back, into, the, river, the, primary, purpose, of, this, is, to, provide, habitat, for, fish, species, whose, breeding, grounds, and, shelter, were, eradicated, by, the, removal, of, the, snags, author, e, j, brady, chronicled, an, eventful, journey, downriver, in, a, small, motor, boat, from, albury, to, the, coast, in, 1911, in, river, rovers, the, volume, and, value, of, river, trade, made, echuca, victoria, s, second, port, and, in, the, decade, from, 1874, it, underwent, considerable, expansion, by, this, time, up, to, thirty, steamers, and, a, similar, number, of, barges, were, working, the, river, in, season, river, transport, began, to, decline, once, the, railways, touched, the, murray, at, numerous, points, the, unreliable, levels, made, it, impossible, for, boats, to, compete, with, the, rail, and, later, road, transport, however, the, river, still, carries, pleasure, boats, along, its, entire, length, today, most, traffic, on, the, river, is, recreational, small, private, boats, are, used, for, water, skiing, and, fishing, houseboats, are, common, both, commercial, for, hire, and, privately, owned, there, are, a, number, of, both, historic, paddle, steamers, and, newer, boats, offering, cruises, ranging, from, half, an, hour, to, five, days, the, murray, river, has, been, a, significant, barrier, to, land, based, travel, and, trade, many, of, the, ports, for, transport, of, goods, along, the, murray, have, also, developed, as, places, to, cross, the, river, either, by, bridge, or, ferry, the, first, bridge, to, cross, the, murray, which, was, built, in, 1869, is, in, the, town, of, murray, bridge, formerly, called, edwards, crossing, to, distinguish, this, bridge, from, the, many, others, that, span, the, murray, river, this, bridge, is, known, as, murray, river, road, bridge, murray, bridge, tolls, applied, on, south, australian, ferries, until, abolished, in, november, 1961, small, scale, pumping, plants, began, drawing, water, from, the, murray, in, the, 1850s, and, the, first, high, volume, plant, was, constructed, at, mildura, in, 1887, the, introduction, of, pumping, stations, along, the, river, promoted, an, expansion, of, farming, and, led, ultimately, to, the, development, of, irrigation, areas, including, the, murrumbidgee, irrigation, area, in, 1915, the, three, murray, states, new, south, wales, victoria, and, south, australia, signed, the, river, murray, agreement, which, proposed, the, construction, of, storage, reservoirs, in, the, river, s, headwaters, as, well, as, at, lake, victoria, near, the, south, australian, border, along, the, intervening, stretch, of, the, river, a, series, of, locks, and, weirs, were, built, these, were, originally, proposed, to, support, navigation, even, in, times, of, low, water, but, riverborne, transport, was, already, declining, due, to, improved, highway, and, railway, systems, the, disruption, of, the, river, s, natural, flow, run, off, from, agriculture, and, the, introduction, of, pest, species, such, as, the, european, carp, has, led, to, serious, environmental, damage, along, the, river, s, length, there, are, widespread, concerns, that, the, river, will, be, unusably, salty, in, the, medium, to, long, term, a, serious, problem, given, that, the, murray, supplies, 40, per, cent, of, the, water, supply, for, adelaide, efforts, to, alleviate, the, problems, have, proceeded, but, disagreement, between, various, groups, has, hampered, progress, introduced, fish, species, such, as, carp, gambusia, weather, loach, redfin, perch, brown, trout, and, rainbow, trout, have, also, had, serious, negative, effects, on, native, fish, the, most, pernicious, are, carp, which, have, contributed, to, environmental, degradation, of, the, murray, and, its, tributaries, by, destroying, aquatic, plants, and, permanently, raising, turbidity, carp, is, the, most, common, species, and, can, be, found, in, all, segments, of, the, river, four, large, reservoirs, were, built, along, the, murray, in, addition, to, lake, victoria, completed, late, 1920s, these, are, lake, hume, near, albury, wodonga, completed, 1936, lake, mulwala, at, yarrawonga, completed, 1939, and, lake, dartmouth, which, is, actually, on, the, mitta, mitta, river, upstream, of, lake, hume, completed, 1979, the, murray, also, receives, water, from, the, complex, dam, and, pipeline, system, of, the, snowy, mountains, scheme, an, additional, reservoir, was, proposed, in, the, 1960s, at, chowilla, dam, which, was, to, have, been, built, in, south, australia, and, would, have, flooded, land, mostly, in, victoria, and, new, south, wales, it, was, cancelled, in, favour, of, building, dartmouth, dam, due, to, costs, and, concerns, relating, to, increased, salinity, from, 1935, to, 1940, a, series, of, barrages, was, built, near, the, murray, mouth, to, stop, seawater, entering, the, lower, part, of, the, river, during, low, flow, periods, they, are, the, goolwa, barrage, with, a, length, of, 632, metres, 2, 073, ft, mundoo, channel, barragel, 800, metres, 2, 600, ft, boundary, creek, barragel, 243, metres, 797, ft, ewe, island, barrage, 853, metres, 2, 799, ft, and, tauwitchere, barrage, 3, 6, kilometres, 2, 2, mi, these, dams, inverted, the, patterns, of, the, river, s, natural, flow, from, the, original, winter, spring, flood, and, summer, autumn, dry, to, the, present, low, level, through, winter, and, higher, during, summer, these, changes, ensured, the, availability, of, water, for, irrigation, and, made, the, murray, valley, australia, s, most, productive, agricultural, region, but, have, seriously, disrupted, the, life, cycles, of, many, ecosystems, both, inside, and, outside, the, river, and, the, irrigation, has, led, to, dryland, salinity, that, now, threatens, the, agricultural, industries, in, 2006, the, government, of, south, australia, released, a, plan, to, investigate, the, construction, of, controversial, wellington, weir, lock, 1, was, completed, near, blanchetown, in, 1922, torrumbarry, weir, downstream, of, echuca, began, operating, in, december, 1923, of, the, several, locks, that, were, proposed, only, thirteen, were, completed, locks, 1, to, 11, on, the, stretch, downstream, of, mildura, lock, 15, at, euston, and, lock, 26, at, torrumbarry, construction, of, the, remaining, weirs, purely, for, navigation, purposes, was, abandoned, in, 1934, the, last, lock, to, be, completed, was, lock, 15, in, 1937, lock, 11, just, downstream, of, mildura, creates, a, 100, kilometre, 62, mi, long, lock, pool, that, aided, irrigation, pumping, from, mildura, and, red, cliffs, each, lock, has, a, navigable, passage, next, to, it, through, the, weir, which, is, opened, during, periods, of, high, river, flow, when, there, is, too, much, water, for, the, lock, the, weirs, can, be, completely, removed, and, the, locks, completely,
