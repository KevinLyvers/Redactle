the, western, united, states, also, called, the, american, west, the, western, states, the, far, west, the, western, territories, and, the, west, is, the, region, comprising, the, westernmost, u, s, states, as, american, settlement, in, the, u, s, expanded, westward, the, meaning, of, the, term, the, west, changed, before, around, 1800, the, crest, of, the, appalachian, mountains, was, seen, as, the, western, frontier, the, frontier, moved, westward, and, eventually, the, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, river, were, considered, the, west, the, u, s, census, bureau, s, definition, of, the, 13, westernmost, states, includes, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, great, basin, to, the, pacific, coast, and, the, mid, pacific, islands, state, hawaii, to, the, east, of, the, western, united, states, is, the, midwestern, united, states, and, the, southern, united, states, with, canada, to, the, north, and, mexico, to, the, south, the, west, contains, several, major, biomes, including, arid, and, semi, arid, plateaus, and, plains, particularly, in, the, american, southwest, forested, mountains, including, three, major, ranges, the, sierra, nevada, the, cascades, and, rocky, mountains, the, long, coastal, shoreline, of, the, american, pacific, coast, and, the, rainforests, of, the, pacific, northwest, the, western, united, states, is, the, largest, region, of, the, country, covering, nearly, half, the, land, area, of, the, contiguous, united, states, it, is, also, the, most, geographically, diverse, incorporating, geographic, regions, such, as, the, temperate, rainforests, of, the, northwest, the, highest, mountain, ranges, including, the, rocky, mountains, the, sierra, nevada, and, the, cascade, range, numerous, glaciers, and, the, western, edge, of, the, great, plains, it, also, contains, the, majority, of, the, desert, areas, located, in, the, united, states, the, mojave, and, the, great, basin, deserts, lie, entirely, within, the, western, region, along, with, parts, of, the, sonoran, and, chihuahuan, deserts, the, latter, extends, significantly, into, texas, while, both, extend, into, mexico, given, this, expansive, and, diverse, geography, it, is, no, wonder, that, the, region, is, difficult, to, define, precisely, sensing, a, possible, shift, in, the, popular, understanding, of, the, west, as, a, region, in, the, early, 1990s, historian, walter, nugent, conducted, a, survey, of, three, groups, of, professionals, with, ties, to, the, region, a, large, group, of, western, historians, 187, respondents, and, two, smaller, groups, 25, journalists, and, publishers, and, 39, western, authors, a, majority, of, the, historian, respondents, placed, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, west, east, of, the, census, definition, out, on, the, eastern, edge, of, the, great, plains, or, on, the, mississippi, river, the, survey, respondents, as, a, whole, showed, just, how, little, agreement, there, was, on, the, boundaries, of, the, west, the, region, is, split, into, two, smaller, units, or, divisions, by, the, u, s, census, bureau, other, classifications, distinguish, between, southwest, and, northwest, arizona, new, mexico, west, texas, and, the, oklahoma, panhandle, are, typically, considered, to, be, the, southwest, states, meanwhile, the, states, of, montana, idaho, oregon, and, washington, can, be, considered, part, of, the, northwest, or, pacific, northwest, the, term, west, coast, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, just, california, oregon, washington, and, alaska, whereas, hawaii, is, more, geographically, isolated, from, the, continental, u, s, and, does, not, necessarily, fit, in, any, of, these, subregions, the, three, inhabited, pacific, u, s, territories, american, samoa, guam, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, are, sometimes, considered, part, of, the, western, united, states, american, samoa, is, in, polynesia, in, the, south, pacific, ocean, while, guam, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, are, in, the, mariana, islands, in, the, western, north, pacific, ocean, guam, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, have, district, courts, within, the, 9th, circuit, which, includes, western, states, such, as, california, and, nevada, see, district, court, of, guam, and, district, court, for, the, northern, mariana, islands, american, samoa, guam, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, are, also, considered, part, of, the, western, u, s, by, the, u, s, national, park, service, the, federal, reserve, bank, system, fema, and, the, usgs, the, population,

82, 4, inhabitants, km, 2, exceed, the, national, average, of, 77, 98, inhabitants, sq, mi, 30, 11, inhabitants, km, 2, as, of, 2022, just, under, half, of, the, 78, 7, million, residents, of, the, west, live, in, california, the, entire, western, region, has, also, been, strongly, influenced, by, european, hispanic, or, latino, asian, and, native, americans, it, contains, the, largest, number, of, minorities, in, the, u, s, while, most, of, the, studies, of, racial, dynamics, in, america, such, as, riots, in, los, angeles, have, been, written, about, european, and, african, americans, in, many, cities, in, the, west, and, california, whites, and, blacks, together, are, less, than, half, the, population, because, of, the, preference, for, the, region, by, hispanics, and, asians, african, and, european, americans, however, continue, to, wield, a, stronger, political, influence, because, of, the, lower, rates, of, citizenship, and, voting, among, asians, and, hispanics, according, to, 2022, estimates, from, the, census, bureau, the, largest, ancestries, reported, in, the, west, are, mexican, 24, 2, german, 10, 1, english, 9, 5, irish, 7, 2, italian, 3, 5, filipino, 3, 4, and, chinese, 3, 3, the, west, also, contains, much, of, the, native, american, population, in, the, u, s, particularly, in, the, large, reservations, in, the, mountain, and, desert, states, as, of, 2022, the, west, is, home, to, 365, 351, navajo, 109, 208, apache, and, 78, 364, blackfeet, as, well, as, 276, 082, people, identifying, as, indigenous, mexican, the, largest, concentrations, for, african, americans, in, the, west, can, be, found, in, san, diego, los, angeles, oakland, sacramento, fresno, san, francisco, seattle, tacoma, phoenix, las, vegas, denver, and, colorado, springs, the, western, united, states, has, a, higher, sex, ratio, more, males, than, females, than, any, other, region, in, the, united, states, because, the, tide, of, development, had, not, yet, reached, most, of, the, west, when, conservation, became, a, national, issue, agencies, of, the, federal, government, own, and, manage, vast, areas, of, land, the, most, important, among, these, are, the, national,

some, local, residents, who, earn, their, livelihoods, on, federal, land, have, come, into, conflict, with, the, land, s, managers, who, are, required, to, keep, land, use, within, environmentally, acceptable, limits, the, largest, city, in, the, region, is, los, angeles, located, on, the, west, coast, other, west, coast, cities, include, san, diego, san, bernardino, san, jose, san, francisco,

the, cascade, range, so, that, the, desert, region, is, only, a, few, miles, wide, by, the, time, one, reaches, the, canada, us, border, the, rockies, are, hundreds, of, miles, wide, and, run, uninterrupted, from, new, mexico, to, alaska, the, rocky, mountain, region, is, the, highest, overall, area, of, the, united, states, with, an, average, elevation, of, above, 4, 000, feet, 1, 200, m, the, tallest, peaks, of, the, rockies, 54, of, which, are, over, 14, 000, feet, 4, 300, m, are, found, in, central, and, western, colorado, east, of, the, rocky, mountains, is, the, great, plains, the, western, portions, for, example, the, eastern, half, of, colorado, of, which, are, generally, considered, to, be, part, of, the, western, united, states, the, west, has, several, long, rivers, that, empty, into, the, pacific, ocean, while, the, eastern, rivers, run, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, mississippi, river, forms, the, easternmost, possible, boundary, for, the, west, today, the, missouri, river, a, tributary, of, the, mississippi, flows, from, its, headwaters, in, the, rocky, mountains, eastward, across, the, great, plains, a, vast, grassy, plateau, before, sloping, gradually, down, to, the, forests, and, hence, to, the, mississippi, the, colorado, river, snakes, through, the, mountain, states, at, one, point, forming, the, grand, canyon, the, colorado, river, is, a, major, source, of, water, in, the, southwest, and, many, dams, such, as, the, hoover, dam, form, reservoirs, along, it, so, much, water, is, drawn, for, drinking, water, throughout, the, west, and, irrigation, in, california, that, in, most, years, water, from, the, colorado, river, no, longer, reaches, the, gulf, of, california, the, columbia, river, the, largest, river, in, volume,

georgia, to, new, york, most, of, the, public, land, held, by, the, u, s, national, forest, service, and, bureau, of, land, management, is, in, the, western, states, public, lands, account, for, 25, to, 75, percent, of, the, total, land, area, in, these, states, the, climate, of, the, west, is, semi, arid, yet, parts, of, the, region, get, high, amounts, of, rain, or, snow, other, parts, are, true, desert, which, receive, less, than, 5, inches, 130, mm, of, rain, per, year, the, climate, is, increasingly, unstable, and, subject, to, periods, of, severe, drought, the, seasonal, temperatures, vary, greatly, throughout, the, west, low, elevations, on, the, west, coast, have, warm, summers, and, mild, winters, with, little, to, no, snow, the, desert, southwest, has, very, hot, summers, and, mild, winters, while, the, mountains, in, the, southwest, receive, generally, large, amounts, of, snow, the, inland, northwest, has, a, continental, climate, of, warm, to, hot, summers, and, cold, to, bitterly, cold, winters, annual, rainfall, is, greater, in, the, eastern, portions, gradually, tapering, off, until, reaching, the, pacific, coast, where, it, increases, again, in, fact, the, greatest, annual, rainfall, in, the, united, states, falls, in, the, coastal, regions, of, the, pacific, northwest, drought, is, much, more, common, in, the, west, than, the, rest, of, the, united, states, the, driest, place, recorded, in, the, u, s, is, death, valley, california, in, western, states, drought, is, closely, associated, with, fire, risk, and, there, have, been, a, number, of, notable, wildfires, causing, extensive, property, damage, and, wildlife, habitat, destruction, the, western, united, states, is, predicted, to, experience, drought, like, conditions, for, much, of, the, 21st, century, violent, thunderstorms, occur, east, of, the, rockies, tornadoes, occur, every, spring, on, the, southern, plains, with, the, most, common, and, most, destructive, centered, on, tornado, alley, which, covers, eastern, portions, of, the, west, texas, to, north, dakota, and, all, states, in, between, and, to, the, east, agriculture, varies, depending, on, rainfall,

urban, sprawl, have, contributed, to, a, sharp, decline, in, citrus, production, in, arizona, many, varieties, of, chile, peppers, are, grown, in, the, valleys, of, new, mexico, starting, in, 1902, congress, passed, a, series, of, acts, authorizing, the, establishment, of, the, united, states, bureau, of, reclamation, to, oversee, water, development, projects, in, seventeen, western, states, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, dams, and, irrigation, projects, provided, water, for, rapid, agricultural, growth, throughout, the, west, and, brought, prosperity, for, several, states, where, agriculture, had, previously, only, been, subsistence, level, following, world, war, ii, the, west, s, cities, experienced, an, economic, and, population, boom, the, population, growth, mostly, in, the, southwest, states, of, new, mexico, utah, colorado, arizona, and, nevada, has, strained, water, and, power, resources, with, water, diverted, from, agricultural, uses, to, major,

united, states, are, extremely, varied, for, instance, large, areas, of, land, are, made, up, of, everything, from, sand, dunes, in, the, central, basin, and, range, ecoregion, which, makes, up, much, of, the, state, of, nevada, to, the, ecology, of, the, north, cascades, in, washington, state, which, has, the, largest, concentration, of, active, alpine, glaciers, in, the, lower, 48, the, densely, forested, areas, found, in, northern, california, oregon, washington, idaho, and, montana, have, mostly, species, adapted, to, living, in, temperate, climates, while, southern, california, nevada, arizona, southern, utah, and, new, mexico, have, a, fauna, resembling, its, position, in, the, dry, deserts, with, temperature, extremes, the, western, continental, coast, of, the, u, s, just, as, the, east, coast, varies, from, a, colder, to, warmer, climate, from, north, to, south, few, species, live, throughout, the, entire, west, coast, however, there, are, some, including, the, bald,

transmuted, them, into, a, myth, of, the, west, which, has, shaped, much, of, american, popular, culture, since, the, late, 19th, century, writers, as, diverse, as, bret, harte, and, zane, grey, celebrated, or, derided, cowboy, culture, while, artists, such, as, frederic, remington, created, western, art, as, a, method, of, recording, the, expansion, into, the, west, the, american, cinema, in, particular, created, the, genre, of, the, western, movie, which, in, many, cases, use, the, west, as, a, metaphor, for, the, virtue, of, self, reliance, and, an, american, ethos, the, contrast, between, the, romanticism, of, culture, about, the, west, and, the, actuality, of, the, history, of, the, westward, expansion, has, been, a, theme, of, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, scholarship, about, the, west, cowboy, culture, has, become, embedded, in, the, american, experience, as, a, common, cultural, touchstone, and, modern, forms, as, diverse, as, country, and, western,
