https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains
the, appalachian, mountains, often, called, the, appalachians, are, a, mountain, range, in, eastern, to, northeastern, north, america, the, term, appalachian, refers, to, several, different, regions, associated, with, the, mountain, range, and, its, surrounding, terrain, the, general, definition, used, is, one, followed, by, the, united, states, geological, survey, and, the, geological, survey, of, canada, to, describe, the, respective, countries, physiographic, regions, the, u, s, uses, the, term, appalachian, highlands, and, canada, uses, the, term, appalachian, uplands, the, appalachian, mountains, are, not, synonymous, with, the, appalachian, plateau, which, is, one, of, the, provinces, of, the, appalachian, highlands, the, appalachian, range, runs, from, the, island, of, newfoundland, in, canada, 2, 050, mi, 3, 300, km, southwestward, to, central, alabama, in, the, united, states, south, of, newfoundland, it, crosses, the, 96, square, mile, archipelago, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, an, overseas, collectivity, of, france, meaning, it, is, technically, in, three, countries, the, highest, peak, of, the, mountain, range, is, mount, mitchell, in, north, carolina, at, 6, 684, feet, 2, 037, m, which, is, also, the, highest, point, in, the, united, states, east, of, the, mississippi, river, the, range, is, older, than, the, other, major, mountain, range, in, north, america, the, rocky, mountains, of, the, west, some, of, the, outcrops, in, the, appalachians, contain, rocks, formed, during, the, precambrian, era, the, geologic, processes, that, led, to, the, formation, of, the, appalachian, mountains, started, 1, 1, billion, years, ago, the, first, mountain, range, in, the, region, was, created, when, the, continents, of, laurentia, and, amazonia, collided, creating, a, supercontinent, called, rodinia, the, collision, of, these, continents, caused, the, rocks, to, be, folded, and, faulted, creating, the, first, mountains, in, the, region, many, of, the, rocks, and, minerals, that, were, formed, during, that, event, can, currently, be, seen, at, the, surface, of, the, present, appalachian, range, around, 480, million, years, ago, geologic, processes, began, that, led, to, three, distinct, orogenic, eras, that, created, much, of, the, surface, structure, seen, in, today, s, appalachians, during, this, period, mountains, once, reached, elevations, similar, to, those, of, the, alps, and, the, rockies, before, natural, erosion, occurred, over, the, last, 240, million, years, leading, to, what, is, present, today, the, appalachian, mountains, are, a, barrier, to, east, west, travel, as, they, form, a, series, of, alternating, ridgelines, and, valleys, oriented, in, opposition, to, most, highways, and, railroads, running, east, west, this, barrier, was, extremely, important, in, shaping, the, expansion, of, the, united, states, in, the, colonial, era, the, range, is, the, home, of, a, very, popular, recreational, feature, the, appalachian, trail, this, is, a, 2, 175, mile, 3, 500, km, hiking, trail, that, runs, all, the, way, from, mount, katahdin, in, maine, to, springer, mountain, in, georgia, passing, over, or, past, a, large, part, of, the, appalachian, range, the, international, appalachian, trail, is, an, extension, of, this, hiking, trail, into, the, canadian, portion, of, the, appalachian, range, in, new, brunswick, and, qu, bec, while, exploring, inland, along, the, northern, coast, of, florida, in, 1528, the, members, of, the, narv, ez, expedition, including, lvar, n, ez, cabeza, de, vaca, found, a, native, american, village, near, present, day, tallahassee, florida, whose, name, they, transcribed, as, apalchen, or, apalachen, the, name, was, soon, altered, by, the, spanish, to, apalachee, and, used, as, a, name, for, the, tribe, and, region, spreading, well, inland, to, the, north, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, s, expedition, first, entered, apalachee, territory, on, june, 15, 1528, and, applied, the, name, now, spelled, appalachian, it, is, the, fourth, oldest, surviving, european, place, name, in, the, us, after, the, 1540, expedition, of, hernando, de, soto, spanish, cartographers, began, to, apply, the, name, of, the, tribe, to, the, mountains, themselves, the, first, cartographic, appearance, of, apalchen, is, on, diego, guti, rrez, s, map, of, 1562, the, first, use, for, the, mountain, range, is, the, map, of, jacques, le, moyne, de, morgues, in, 1565, the, name, was, not, commonly, used, for, the, whole, mountain, range, until, the, late, 19th, century, a, competing, and, often, more, popular, name, was, the, allegheny, mountains, alleghenies, and, even, alleghania, in, the, early, 19th, century, washington, irving, proposed, renaming, the, united, states, either, appalachia, or, alleghania, in, u, s, dialects, in, the, southern, regions, of, the, appalachians, the, word, is, pronounced, p, l, t, n, z, with, the, third, syllable, sounding, like, latch, in, northern, parts, of, the, mountain, range, it, is, pronounced, p, l, e, t, n, z, or, p, l, e, n, z, the, third, syllable, is, like, lay, and, the, fourth, chins, or, shins, there, is, often, great, debate, between, the, residents, of, the, regions, regarding, the, correct, pronunciation, elsewhere, a, commonly, accepted, pronunciation, for, the, adjective, appalachian, is, p, l, t, i, n, with, the, last, two, syllables, ian, pronounced, as, in, the, word, romanian, perhaps, partly, because, the, range, runs, through, large, portions, of, both, the, united, states, and, canada, and, partly, because, the, range, was, formed, over, numerous, geologic, time, periods, one, of, which, is, sometimes, termed, the, appalachian, orogeny, writing, communities, struggle, to, agree, on, an, encyclopedic, definition, of, the, mountain, range, however, each, of, the, governments, has, an, agency, that, informs, the, public, about, the, major, landforms, that, make, up, the, countries, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, and, the, geological, survey, of, canada, gsc, the, landforms, are, referred, to, as, physiographic, regions, the, regions, create, precise, boundaries, from, which, maps, can, be, drawn, the, appalachian, highlands, is, the, name, of, one, of, the, eight, physiographic, regions, of, the, contiguous, 48, united, states, the, appalachian, uplands, is, the, name, of, one, of, seven, physiographic, regions, of, canada, the, second, level, in, the, physiographic, classification, schema, for, the, usgs, is, province, the, same, word, as, canada, uses, to, divide, its, political, subdivisions, meaning, that, the, terminology, used, by, the, two, countries, do, not, match, below, the, region, level, the, lowest, level, of, classification, is, section, the, appalachian, uplands, are, one, of, the, seven, physiographic, divisions, in, canada, canada, s, gsc, does, not, use, the, same, classification, system, as, the, usgs, below, the, division, level, the, agency, does, break, the, divisions, of, the, appalachian, uplands, into, 13, subsections, that, are, in, four, different, political, provinces, of, canada, while, the, appalachian, highlands, and, appalachian, uplands, are, generally, continuous, across, the, u, s, canadian, border, the, st, lawrence, valley, area, is, handled, differently, in, the, physiographic, classification, schemas, the, part, of, the, st, lawrence, valley, in, the, united, states, is, one, of, the, second, level, classifications, part, of, the, appalachian, highlands, in, canada, the, area, is, part, of, the, first, level, classification, the, st, lawrence, lowlands, this, includes, the, area, around, the, city, of, montreal, anticosti, island, and, the, northwest, coastline, of, newfoundland, the, dissected, plateau, area, while, not, actually, made, up, of, geological, mountains, is, popularly, called, mountains, especially, in, eastern, kentucky, and, west, virginia, and, while, the, ridges, are, not, high, the, terrain, is, extremely, rugged, in, ohio, and, new, york, some, of, the, plateau, has, been, glaciated, which, has, rounded, off, the, sharp, ridges, and, filled, the, valleys, to, some, extent, the, glaciated, regions, are, usually, referred, to, as, hill, country, rather, than, mountains, the, appalachian, belt, includes, the, plateaus, sloping, southward, to, the, atlantic, ocean, in, new, england, and, southeastward, to, the, border, of, the, coastal, plain, through, the, central, and, southern, atlantic, states, and, on, the, northwest, the, allegheny, and, cumberland, plateaus, declining, toward, the, great, lakes, and, the, interior, plains, a, remarkable, feature, of, the, belt, is, the, longitudinal, chain, of, broad, valleys, including, the, great, appalachian, valley, which, in, the, southerly, sections, divides, the, mountain, system, into, two, unequal, portions, but, in, the, northernmost, lies, west, of, all, the, ranges, possessing, typical, appalachian, features, and, separates, them, from, the, adirondack, group, the, mountain, system, has, no, axis, of, dominating, altitudes, but, in, every, portion, the, summits, rise, to, rather, uniform, heights, and, especially, in, the, central, section, the, various, ridges, and, intermontane, valleys, have, the, same, trend, as, the, system, itself, none, of, the, summits, reaches, the, region, of, perpetual, snow, in, pennsylvania, there, are, over, sixty, summits, that, rise, over, 2, 500, ft, 800, m, the, summits, of, mount, davis, and, blue, knob, rise, over, 3, 000, ft, 900, m, in, maryland, eagle, rock, and, dans, mountain, are, conspicuous, points, reaching, 3, 162, and, 2, 882, ft, 964, and, 878, m, respectively, on, the, same, side, of, the, great, valley, south, of, the, potomac, are, the, pinnacle, 3, 007, feet, 917, m, and, pidgeon, roost, 3, 400, ft, 1, 000, m, in, west, virginia, more, than, 150, peaks, rise, above, 4, 000, ft, 1, 200, m, including, spruce, knob, 4, 863, ft, 1, 482, m, the, highest, point, in, the, allegheny, mountains, a, number, of, other, points, in, the, state, rise, above, 4, 800, ft, 1, 500, m, cheat, mountain, snowshoe, mountain, at, thorny, flat, 4, 848, ft, 1, 478, m, and, bald, knob, 4, 842, ft, 1, 476, m, are, among, the, more, notable, peaks, in, west, virginia, the, blue, ridge, mountains, rising, in, southern, pennsylvania, and, there, known, as, south, mountain, attain, elevations, of, about, 2, 000, ft, 600, m, in, pennsylvania, south, mountain, achieves, its, highest, point, just, below, the, mason, dixon, line, in, maryland, at, quirauk, mountain, 2, 145, ft, 654, m, and, then, diminishes, in, height, southward, to, the, potomac, river, once, in, virginia, the, blue, ridge, again, reaches, 2, 000, ft, 600, m, and, higher, in, the, virginia, blue, ridge, the, following, are, some, of, the, highest, peaks, north, of, the, roanoke, river, stony, man, 4, 031, ft, 1, 229, m,

southernmost, spur, of, the, blue, ridge, mountains, sources, written, prior, to, the, recognition, of, the, physiographic, region, concept, divided, the, appalachian, mountains, into, three, major, sections, plate, tectonics, over, the, period, dating, back, at, least, 1, billion, years, led, to, geological, creation, of, the, land, that, is, now, the, appalachian, mountain, range, the, continental, movement, led, to, collisions, that, built, mountains, and, they, later, pulled, apart, creating, oceans, over, parts, of, the, continent, that, are, now, exposed, the, first, mountain, building, tectonic, plate, collision, that, initiated, the, construction, of, what, are, today, the, appalachians, occurred, at, least, a, billion, years, ago, when, the, pre, north, american, craton, called, laurentia, collided, with, at, least, one, other, craton, amazonia, all, the, other, cratons, of, the, earth, also, collided, at, about, this, time, to, form, the, supercontinent, rodinia, and, were, surrounded, by, one, single, ocean, it, is, possible, that, the, cratons, of, kalahari, and, rio, plato, were, also, part, of, that, early, collision, since, they, were, present, as, rodinia, broke, up, mountain, building, referred, to, as, the, grenville, orogeny, occurred, along, the, boundaries, of, the, cratons, the, present, appalachian, mountains, have, at, least, two, areas, which, are, made, from, rock, formations, that, were, formed, during, this, orogeny, the, blue, ridge, mountains, and, the, adirondacks, after, the, grenville, orogeny, the, direction, of, the, continental, drift, reversed, and, the, single, supercontinent, rodinia, began, to, break, up, the, mountains, formed, during, the, grenvillian, era, underwent, erosion, due, to, weathering, glaciation, and, other, natural, processes, resulting, in, the, leveling, of, the, landscape, the, eroded, sediments, from, these, mountains, contributed, to, the, formation, of, sedimentary, basins, and, valleys, for, example, in, what, is, now, the, southern, united, states, the, ococee, basin, was, formed, seawater, filled, the, basin, rivers, from, the, surrounding, countryside, carried, clay, silt, sand, and, gravel, to, the, basin, much, as, rivers, today, carry, sediment, from, the, midcontinent, region, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, sediment, spread, out, in, layers, on, the, basin, floor, the, basin, continued, to, subside, and, over, a, long, period, of, time, probably, millions, of, years, a, great, thickness, of, sediment, accumulated, eventually, the, tectonic, forces, pulling, the, two, continents, apart, became, so, strong, that, an, ocean, formed, off, the, eastern, coast, of, the, laurentian, margin, this, was, called, the, iapetus, ocean, and, was, the, precursor, of, the, modern, atlantic, ocean, the, rocks, of, the, valley, and, ridge, province, formed, over, millions, of, years, in, the, iapetus, shells, and, other, hard, parts, of, ancient, marine, plants, and, animals, accumulated, to, form, limey, deposits, that, later, became, limestone, this, is, the, same, process, by, which, limestone, forms, in, modern, oceans, the, weathering, of, limestone, now, exposed, at, the, land, surface, produces, the, lime, rich, soils, that, are, so, prevalent, in, the, fertile, farmland, of, the, valley, and, ridge, province, during, this, continental, break, up, around, 600, million, to, 560, million, years, ago, volcanic, activity, was, present, along, the, tectonic, margins, there, is, evidence, of, this, activity, in, today, s, blue, ridge, mountains, mount, rogers, whitetop, mountain, and, pine, mountain, are, all, the, result, of, volcanic, activity, that, occurred, around, this, time, evidence, of, subsurface, activity, dikes, and, sills, intruding, into, the, overlying, rock, is, present, in, the, blue, ridge, as, well, for, instance, mafic, rocks, have, been, found, along, the, fries, fault, in, the, central, blue, ridge, area, of, montgomery, county, va, the, iapetus, continued, to, expand, and, during, that, time, bacteria, algae, and, many, species, of, invertebrates, flourished, in, the, oceans, but, there, were, no, plants, or, animals, on, land, then, during, the, middle, ordovician, period, about, 500, to, 470, million, years, ago, the, motion, of, the, crustal, plates, changed, and, the, continents, began, to, move, back, toward, each, other, the, once, quiet, appalachian, passive, margin, changed, to, a, very, active, plate, boundary, when, a, neighboring, iapetus, oceanic, plate, containing, a, volcanic, arc, collided, with, and, began, sinking, beneath, the, north, american, craton, volcanoes, grew, along, the, continental, margin, coincident, with, the, initiation, of, subduction, thrust, faulting, uplifted, and, warped, older, sedimentary, rock, laid, down, on, the, passive, margin, as, the, mountains, rose, erosion, began, to, wear, them, down, over, time, streams, carried, rock, debris, downslope, to, be, deposited, in, nearby, lowlands, the, taconic, orogeny, ended, after, about, 60, million, years, but, built, much, of, the, land, mass, that, is, now, new, england, and, southwestward, to, pennsylvania, the, taconic, orogeny, was, the, second, of, four, mountain, building, plate, collisions, that, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, appalachians, culminating, in, the, collision, of, north, america, and, africa, see, alleghanian, orogeny, the, third, mountain, building, event, was, the, acadian, orogeny, which, occurred, between, 375, and, 359, million, years, ago, the, acadian, orogeny, was, caused, by, a, series, of, collisions, of, pieces, of, crust, from, the, avalonia, terrane, sections, broken, off, from, continent, of, gondwana, with, the, north, american, plate, the, collision, initiating, this, orogeny, resulted, in, the, closing, of, the, southern, iapetus, ocean, and, the, formation, of, a, high, mountain, belt, after, the, acadian, collision, took, place, gondwana, began, to, retreat, from, laurentia, with, the, newly, accreted, avalonian, terranes, left, behind, as, gondwana, moved, away, a, new, ocean, opened, up, the, rheic, ocean, during, the, middle, to, late, devonian, and, subsequently, its, closure, would, result, in, the, formation, of, the, alleghanian, orogeny, as, the, continental, plates, moved, closer, together, fragments, of, oceanic, crust, islands, and, other, continental, masses, collided, with, the, eastern, margin, of, ancestral, north, america, by, this, time, plants, had, appeared, on, land, followed, by, scorpions, insects, and, amphibians, the, ocean, continued, to, shrink, until, about, 270, million, years, ago, the, continents, that, were, ancestral, to, north, america, and, africa, collided, during, the, formation, of, the, supercontinent, pangea, because, north, america, and, africa, were, once, geographically, connected, the, appalachians, formed, part, of, the, same, mountain, chain, as, the, little, atlas, in, morocco, this, mountain, range, known, as, the, central, pangean, mountains, extended, into, scotland, before, the, mesozoic, era, opening, of, the, iapetus, ocean, from, the, north, america, europe, collision, see, caledonian, orogeny, by, the, end, of, the, mesozoic, era, the, appalachian, mountains, had, been, eroded, to, an, almost, flat, plain, it, was, not, until, the, region, was, uplifted, during, the, cenozoic, era, that, the, distinctive, topography, of, the, present, formed, uplift, rejuvenated, the, streams, which, rapidly, responded, by, cutting, downward, into, the, ancient, bedrock, some, streams, flowed, along, weak, layers, that, define, the, folds, and, faults, created, many, millions, of, years, earlier, other, streams, downcut, so, rapidly, that, they, cut, right, across, the, resistant, folded, rocks, of, the, mountain, core, carving, canyons, across, rock, layers, and, geologic, structures, the, appalachian, mountains, contain, major, deposits, of, anthracite, coal, as, well, as, bituminous, coal, in, the, folded, mountains, the, coal, is, in, metamorphosed, form, as, anthracite, represented, by, the, coal, region, of, northeastern, pennsylvania, the, bituminous, coal, fields, of, western, pennsylvania, western, maryland, southeastern, ohio, eastern, kentucky, southwestern, virginia, and, west, virginia, contain, the, sedimentary, form, of, coal, the, mountain, top, removal, method, of, coal, mining, in, which, entire, mountain, tops, are, removed, is, currently, threatening, vast, areas, and, ecosystems, of, the, appalachian, mountain, region, the, surface, coal, mining, that, started, in, the, 1940s, has, significantly, impacted, the, central, appalachian, mountains, in, kentucky, tennessee, virginia, and, west, virginia, early, mining, methods, were, unregulated, and, mined, land, reclamation, research, including, acid, base, reaction, was, led, by, the, west, virginia, university, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, west, virginia, developed, rigorous, mine, reclamation, standards, for, state, coal, mines, in, the, late, 1960s, regulations, were, introduced, by, most, federal, states, to, protect, the, appalachian, mountains, by, the, late, 1960s, social, and, political, activism, brought, about, the, surface, mining, control, and, reclamation, act, of, 1977, the, 1859, discovery, of, commercial, quantities, of, petroleum, in, the, appalachian, mountains, of, western, pennsylvania, started, the, modern, united, states, petroleum, industry, recent, discoveries, of, commercial, natural, gas, deposits, in, the, marcellus, shale, formation, and, utica, shale, formations, have, once, again, focused, oil, industry, attention, on, the, appalachian, basin, some, plateaus, of, the, appalachian, mountains, contain, metallic, minerals, such, as, iron, and, zinc, there, are, many, geological, issues, concerning, the, rivers, and, streams, of, the, appalachians, in, spite, of, the, existence, of, the, great, appalachian, valley, many, of, the, main, rivers, are, transverse, to, the, mountain, system, axis, the, drainage, divide, of, the, appalachians, follows, a, tortuous, course, that, crosses, the, mountainous, belt, just, north, of, the, new, river, in, virginia, south, of, the, new, river, rivers, head, into, the, blue, ridge, cross, the, higher, unakas, receive, important, tributaries, from, the, great, valley, and, traversing, the, cumberland, plateau, in, spreading, gorges, water, gaps, escape, by, way, of, the, cumberland, river, and, the, tennessee, river, rivers, to, the, ohio, river, and, the, mississippi, river, and, thence, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, the, central, section, north, of, the, new, river, the, rivers, rising, in, or, just, beyond, the, valley, ridges, flow, through, great, gorges, to, the, great, valley, and, then, across, the, blue, ridge, to, tidal, estuaries, penetrating, the, coastal, plain, via, the, roanoke, river, james, river, potomac, river, and, susquehanna, river, in, the, northern, section, the, height, of, land, lies, on, the, inland, side, of, the, mountainous, belt, and, thus, the, main, lines, of, drainage, run, from, north, to, south, exemplified, by, the, hudson, river, however, the, valley, through, which, the, hudson, river, flows, was, cut, by, the, gigantic, glaciers, of, the, ice, ages, the, same, glaciers, that, deposited, their, terminal, moraines, in, southern, new, york, and, formed, the, east, west, long, island, the, appalachian, region, is, generally, considered, the, geographical, divide, between, the, eastern, seaboard, of, the, united, states, and, the, midwest, region, of, the, country, the, eastern, continental, divide, follows, the, appalachian, mountains, from, pennsylvania, to, georgia, the, appalachians, particularly, the, central, and, southern, regions, is, one, of, the, most, biodiverse, places, in, north, america, the, north, south, orientation, of, the, long, ridges, and, valleys, contributes, to, the, high, number, of, plant, and, animal, species, species, were, able, to, migrate, through, these, from, either, direction, during, alternating, periods, of, warming, and, cooling, settling, in, the, microclimates, that, best, suited, them, the, flora, of, the, appalachians, are, diverse, and, vary, primarily, in, response, to, geology, latitude, elevation, and, moisture, availability, geobotanically, they, constitute, a, floristic, province, of, the, north, american, atlantic, region, the, appalachians, consist, primarily, of, deciduous, broad, leaf, trees, and, evergreen, needle, leaf, conifers, but, also, contain, the, evergreen, broad, leaf, american, holly, ilex, opaca, and, the, deciduous, needle, leaf, conifer, the, tamarack, or, eastern, larch, larix, laricina, the, dominant, northern, and, high, elevation, conifer, is, the, red, spruce, picea, rubens, which, grows, from, near, sea, level, to, above, 4, 000, ft, 1, 200, m, above, sea, level, asl, in, northern, new, england, and, southeastern, canada, it, also, grows, southward, along, the, appalachian, crest, to, the, highest, elevations, of, the, southern, appalachians, as, in, north, carolina, and, tennessee, in, the, central, appalachians, it, is, usually, confined, above, 3, 000, ft, 900, m, asl, except, for, a, few, cold, valleys, in, which, it, reaches, lower, elevations, in, the, southern, appalachians, it, is, restricted, to, higher, elevations, another, species, is, the, black, spruce, picea, mariana, which, extends, farthest, north, of, any, conifer, in, north, america, is, found, at, high, elevations, in, the, northern, appalachians, and, in, bogs, as, far, south, as, pennsylvania, the, appalachians, are, also, home, to, two, species, of, fir, the, boreal, balsam, fir, abies, balsamea, and, the, southern, high, elevation, endemic, fraser, fir, abies, fraseri, fraser, fir, is, endemic, to, the, highest, parts, of, the, southern, appalachian, mountains, where, along, with, red, spruce, it, forms, a, fragile, ecosystem, known, as, the, southern, appalachian, spruce, fir, forest, fraser, fir, rarely, occurs, below, 5, 500, ft, 1, 700, m, and, becomes, the, dominant, tree, type, at, 6, 200, ft, 1, 900, m, by, contrast, balsam, fir, is, found, from, near, sea, level, to, the, tree, line, in, the, northern, appalachians, but, ranges, only, as, far, south, as, virginia, and, west, virginia, in, the, central, appalachians, where, it, is, usually, confined, above, 3, 900, ft, 1, 200, m, asl, except, in, cold, valleys, curiously, it, is, associated, with, oaks, in, virginia, the, balsam, fir, of, virginia, and, west, virginia, is, thought, by, some, to, be, a, natural, hybrid, between, the, more, northern, variety, and, fraser, fir, while, red, spruce, is, common, in, both, upland, and, bog, habitats, balsam, fir, as, well, as, black, spruce, and, tamarack, are, more, characteristic, of, the, latter, however, balsam, fir, also, does, well, in, soils, with, a, ph, as, high, as, 6, eastern, or, canada, hemlock, tsuga, canadensis, is, another, important, evergreen, needle, leaf, conifer, that, grows, along, the, appalachian, chain, from, north, to, south, but, is, confined, to, lower, elevations, than, red, spruce, and, the, firs, it, generally, occupies, richer, and, less, acidic, soils, than, the, spruce, and, firs, and, is, characteristic, of, deep, shaded, and, moist, mountain, valleys, and, coves, it, is, subject, to, the, hemlock, woolly, adelgid, adelges, tsugae, an, introduced, insect, that, is, rapidly, extirpating, it, as, a, forest, tree, less, abundant, and, restricted, to, the, southern, appalachians, is, carolina, hemlock, tsuga, caroliniana, like, canada, hemlock, this, tree, suffers, severely, from, the, hemlock, woolly, adelgid, several, species, of, pines, characteristic, of, the, appalachians, are, eastern, white, pine, pinus, strobus, virginia, pine, pinus, virginiana, pitch, pine, pinus, rigida, table, mountain, pine, pinus, pungens, and, shortleaf, pine, pinus, echinata, red, pine, pinus, resinosa, is, a, boreal, species, that, forms, a, few, high, elevation, outliers, as, far, south, as, west, virginia, all, of, these, species, except, white, pine, tend, to, occupy, sandy, rocky, poor, soil, sites, which, are, mostly, acidic, in, character, white, pine, a, large, species, valued, for, its, timber, tends, to, do, best, in, rich, moist, soil, either, acidic, or, alkaline, in, character, pitch, pine, is, also, at, home, in, acidic, boggy, soil, and, table, mountain, pine, may, occasionally, be, found, in, this, habitat, as, well, shortleaf, pine, is, generally, found, in, warmer, habitats, and, at, lower, elevations, than, the, other, species, all, the, species, listed, do, best, in, open, or, lightly, shaded, habitats, although, white, pine, also, thrives, in, shady, coves, valleys, and, on, floodplains, the, appalachians, are, characterized, by, a, wealth, of, large, beautiful, deciduous, broadleaf, hardwood, trees, their, occurrences, are, best, summarized, and, described, in, e, lucy, braun, s, 1950, classic, deciduous, forests, of, eastern, north, america, macmillan, new, york, the, most, diverse, and, richest, forests, are, the, mixed, mesophytic, or, medium, moisture, types, which, are, largely, confined, to, rich, moist, montane, soils, of, the, southern, and, central, appalachians, particularly, in, the, cumberland, and, allegheny, mountains, but, also, thrive, in, the, southern, appalachian, coves, characteristic, canopy, species, are, white, basswood, tilia, heterophylla, yellow, buckeye, aesculus, octandra, sugar, maple, acer, saccharum, american, beech, fagus, grandifolia, tuliptree, liriodendron, tulipifera, white, ash, fraxinus, americana, and, yellow, birch, betula, alleganiensis, other, common, trees, are, red, maple, acer, rubrum, shagbark, and, bitternut, hickories, carya, ovata, and, c, cordiformis, and, black, or, sweet, birch, betula, lenta, small, understory, trees, and, shrubs, include, flowering, dogwood, cornus, florida, hophornbeam, ostrya, virginiana, witch, hazel, hamamelis, virginiana, and, spicebush, lindera, benzoin, there, are, also, hundreds, of, perennial, and, annual, herbs, among, them, such, herbal, and, medicinal, plants, as, american, ginseng, panax, quinquefolius, goldenseal, hydrastis, canadensis, bloodroot, sanguinaria, canadensis, and, black, cohosh, cimicifuga, racemosa, the, foregoing, trees, shrubs, and, herbs, are, also, more, widely, distributed, in, less, rich, mesic, forests, that, generally, occupy, coves, stream, valleys, and, flood, plains, throughout, the, southern, and, central, appalachians, at, low, and, intermediate, elevations, in, the, northern, appalachians, and, at, higher, elevations, of, the, central, and, southern, appalachians, these, diverse, mesic, forests, give, way, to, less, diverse, northern, hardwood, forests, with, canopies, dominated, only, by, american, beech, sugar, maple, american, basswood, tilia, americana, and, yellow, birch, and, with, far, fewer, species, of, shrubs, and, herbs, drier, and, rockier, uplands, and, ridges, are, occupied, by, oak, chestnut, forests, dominated, by, a, variety, of, oaks, quercus, spp, hickories, carya, spp, and, in, the, past, by, the, american, chestnut, castanea, dentata, the, american, chestnut, was, virtually, eliminated, as, a, canopy, species, by, the, introduced, fungal, chestnut, blight, cryphonectaria, parasitica, but, lives, on, as, sapling, sized, sprouts, that, originate, from, roots, which, are, not, killed, by, the, fungus, in, present, day, forest, canopies, chestnut, has, been, largely, replaced, by, oaks, the, oak, forests, of, the, southern, and, central, appalachians, consist, largely, of, black, northern, red, white, chestnut, and, scarlet, oaks, quercus, velutina, q, rubra, q, alba, q, prinus, and, q, coccinea, and, hickories, such, as, the, pignut, carya, glabra, in, particular, the, richest, forests, which, grade, into, mesic, types, usually, in, coves, and, on, gentle, slopes, have, predominantly, white, and, northern, red, oaks, while, the, driest, sites, are, dominated, by, chestnut, oak, or, sometimes, by, scarlet, or, northern, red, oaks, in, the, northern, appalachians, the, oaks, except, for, white, and, northern, red, drop, out, while, the, latter, extends, farthest, north, the, oak, forests, generally, lack, the, diverse, small, tree, shrub, and, herb, layers, of, mesic, forests, shrubs, are, generally, ericaceous, and, include, the, evergreen, mountain, laurel, kalmia, latifolia, various, species, of, blueberries, vaccinium, spp, black, huckleberry, gaylussacia, baccata, a, number, of, deciduous, rhododendrons, azaleas, and, smaller, heaths, such, as, teaberry, gaultheria, procumbens, and, trailing, arbutus, epigaea, repens, the, evergreen, great, rhododendron, rhododendron, maximum, is, characteristic, of, moist, stream, valleys, these, occurrences, are, in, line, with, the, prevailing, acidic, character, of, most, oak, forest, soils, in, contrast, the, much, rarer, chinquapin, oak, quercus, muehlenbergii, demands, alkaline, soils, and, generally, grows, where, limestone, rock, is, near, the, surface, hence, no, ericaceous, shrubs, are, associated, with, it, the, appalachian, flora, also, include, a, diverse, assemblage, of, bryophytes, mosses, and, liverworts, as, well, as, fungi, some, species, are, rare, and, or, endemic, as, with, vascular, plants, these, tend, to, be, closely, related, to, the, character, of, the, soils, and, the, thermal, environment, in, which, they, are, found, eastern, deciduous, forests, are, subject, to, a, number, of, serious, insect, and, disease, outbreaks, among, the, most, conspicuous, is, that, of, the, introduced, spongy, moth, lymantria, dispar, which, infests, primarily, oaks, causing, severe, defoliation, and, tree, mortality, but, it, also, has, the, benefit, of, eliminating, weak, individuals, and, thus, improving, the, genetic, stock, as, well, as, creating, rich, habitat, of, a, type, through, accumulation, of, dead, wood, because, hardwoods, sprout, so, readily, this, moth, is, not, as, harmful, as, the, hemlock, woolly, adelgid, perhaps, more, serious, is, the, introduced, beech, bark, disease, complex, which, includes, both, a, scale, insect, cryptococcus, fagisuga, and, fungal, components, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, appalachian, forests, were, subject, to, severe, and, destructive, logging, and, land, clearing, which, resulted, in, the, designation, of, the, national, forests, and, parks, as, well, many, state, protected, areas, however, these, and, a, variety, of, other, destructive, activities, continue, albeit, in, diminished, forms, and, thus, far, only, a, few, ecologically, based, management, practices, have, taken, hold, appalachian, bogs, are, boreal, ecosystems, which, occur, in, many, places, in, the, appalachians, particularly, the, allegheny, and, blue, ridge, subranges, though, popularly, called, bogs, many, of, them, are, technically, fens, several, mountain, summits, in, the, southern, appalachians, are, covered, with, expansive, open, habitats, either, grassy, meadows, or, heath, known, as, appalachian, balds, these, habitats, support, many, unique, plant, and, animal, communities, including, rare, relict, species, that, are, adapted, to, the, open, exposed, habitat, their, origins, are, heavily, debated, while, all, were, formerly, thought, to, have, anthropogenic, origins, more, recent, evidence, indicates, a, mixed, origin, many, were, formed, by, climatic, conditions, in, the, pleistocene, and, kept, open, by, pleistocene, megafauna, then, by, other, grazing, wildlife, such, as, bison, elk, and, deer, and, native, american, burning, practices, and, finally, by, grazing, livestock, introduced, by, european, settlers, others, especially, those, dominated, by, introduced, grasses, may, be, fully, anthropogenic, in, origin, the, abandonment, of, grazing, has, caused, trees, to, encroach, on, many, of, these, balds, threatening, their, ecosystems, in, contrast, to, the, largely, grazing, influenced, balds, of, the, southern, appalachians, parts, of, the, northern, appalachians, such, as, the, white, mountains, the, adirondack, mountains, and, mount, katahdin, have, summits, covered, with, true, alpine, tundra, these, ecosystems, are, kept, clear, due, to, extremely, harsh, winter, storms, and, support, a, vegetation, community, more, akin, to, that, of, the, arctic, circle, animals, that, characterize, the, appalachian, forests, include, five, species, of, tree, squirrels, the, most, commonly, seen, is, the, low, to, moderate, elevation, eastern, gray, squirrel, sciurus, carolinensis, occupying, similar, habitat, is, the, slightly, larger, fox, squirrel, sciurus, niger, and, the, much, smaller, southern, flying, squirrel, glaucomys, volans, more, characteristic, of, cooler, northern, and, high, elevation, habitat, is, the, red, squirrel, tamiasciurus, hudsonicus, whereas, the, appalachian, northern, flying, squirrel, glaucomys, sabrinus, fuscus, which, closely, resembles, the, southern, flying, squirrel, is, confined, to, northern, hardwood, and, spruce, fir, forests, as, familiar, as, squirrels, are, the, eastern, cottontail, rabbit, silvilagus, floridanus, and, the, white, tailed, deer, odocoileus, virginianus, the, latter, in, particular, has, greatly, increased, in, abundance, as, a, result, of, the, extirpation, of, the, eastern, wolf, canis, lupus, lycaon, and, the, north, american, cougar, this, has, led, to, the, overgrazing, and, browsing, of, many, plants, of, the, appalachian, forests, as, well, as, destruction, of, agricultural, crops, other, deer, include, the, moose, alces, alces, found, only, in, the, north, and, the, elk, cervus, canadensis, which, although, once, extirpated, is, now, making, a, comeback, through, transplantation, in, the, southern, and, central, appalachians, in, quebec, the, chic, chocs, host, the, only, population, of, reindeer, rangifer, tarandus, south, of, the, st, lawrence, river, an, additional, species, that, is, common, in, the, north, but, extends, its, range, southward, at, high, elevations, to, virginia, and, west, virginia, is, the, varying, or, snowshoe, hare, lepus, americanus, however, these, central, appalachian, populations, are, scattered, and, very, small, another, species, of, great, interest, is, the, beaver, castor, canadensis, which, is, showing, a, great, resurgence, in, numbers, after, its, near, extirpation, for, its, pelt, this, resurgence, is, bringing, about, a, drastic, alteration, in, habitat, through, the, construction, of, dams, and, other, structures, throughout, the, mountains, other, common, forest, animals, are, the, black, bear, ursus, americanus, striped, skunk, mephitis, mephitis, raccoon, procyon, lotor, opossum, didelphis, virginianus, woodchuck, marmota, monax, bobcat, lynx, rufus, gray, fox, urocyon, cinereoargenteus, red, fox, vulpes, vulpes, and, in, recent, years, the, coyote, canis, latrans, another, species, favored, by, the, advent, of, europeans, and, the, extirpation, of, eastern, and, red, wolves, canis, rufus, european, boars, sus, scrofa, were, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, characteristic, birds, of, the, forest, are, wild, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, silvestris, ruffed, grouse, bonasa, umbellus, mourning, dove, zenaida, macroura, common, raven, corvus, corax, wood, duck, aix, sponsa, great, horned, owl, bubo, virginianus, barred, owl, strix, varia, screech, owl, megascops, asio, red, tailed, hawk, buteo, jamaicensis, red, shouldered, hawk, buteo, lineatus, and, northern, goshawk, as, well, as, a, great, variety, of, songbirds, passeriformes, like, the, warblers, in, particular, of, great, importance, are, the, many, species, of, salamanders, and, in, particular, the, lungless, species, family, plethodontidae, that, live, in, great, abundance, concealed, by, leaves, and, debris, on, the, forest, floor, most, frequently, seen, however, is, the, eastern, or, red, spotted, newt, notophthalmus, viridescens, whose, terrestrial, eft, form, is, often, encountered, on, the, open, dry, forest, floor, it, has, been, estimated, that, salamanders, represent, the, largest, class, of, animal, biomass, in, the, appalachian, forests, frogs, and, toads, are, of, lesser, diversity, and, abundance, but, the, wood, frog, rana, sylvatica, is, like, the, eft, commonly, encountered, on, the, dry, forest, floor, while, a, number, of, species, of, small, frogs, such, as, spring, peepers, pseudacris, crucifer, enliven, the, forest, with, their, calls, salamanders, and, other, amphibians, contribute, greatly, to, nutrient, cycling, through, their, consumption, of, small, life, forms, on, the, forest, floor, and, in, aquatic, habitats, although, reptiles, are, less, abundant, and, diverse, than, amphibians, a, number, of, snakes, are, conspicuous, members, of, the, fauna, one, of, the, largest, is, the, non, venomous, black, rat, snake, elaphe, obsoleta, obsoleta, while, the, common, garter, snake, thamnophis, sirtalis, is, among, the, smallest, but, most, abundant, the, eastern, copperhead, agkistrodon, contortrix, and, the, timber, rattler, crotalus, horridus, are, venomous, pit, vipers, there, are, few, lizards, but, the, broad, headed, skink, eumeces, laticeps, at, up, to, 13, in, 33, cm, in, length, and, an, excellent, climber, and, swimmer, is, one, of, the, largest, and, most, spectacular, in, appearance, and, action, the, most, common, turtle, is, the, eastern, box, turtle, terrapene, carolina, carolina, which, is, found, in, both, upland, and, lowland, forests, in, the, central, and, southern, appalachians, prominent, among, aquatic, species, is, the, large, common, snapping, turtle, chelydra, serpentina, which, occurs, throughout, the, appalachians, appalachian, streams, are, notable, for, their, highly, diverse, freshwater, fish, life, among, the, most, abundant, and, diverse, are, those, of, the, minnow, family, family, cyprinidae, while, species, of, the, colorful, darters, percina, spp, are, also, abundant, a, characteristic, fish, of, shaded, cool, appalachian, forest, streams, is, the, wild, brook, or, speckled, trout, salvelinus, fontinalis, which, is, much, sought, after, as, a, game, fish, the, roots, of, the, appalachian, regions, histories, trace, back, to, the, indigenous, peoples, who, inhabited, these, lands, long, before, european, arrival, indigenous, communities, across, the, appalachians, developed, diverse, cultures, languages, and, societies, adapting, to, the, region, s, varying, environments, and, ecosystems, the, interactions, between, indigenous, communities, and, the, natural, world, laid, the, foundation, for, the, intricate, relationship, between, humans, and, the, appalachian, landscape, indigenous, peoples, thrived, in, these, challenging, terrains, adapting, their, lifestyles, to, the, resources, available, they, forged, deep, connections, with, the, land, developing, sustainable, practices, for, hunting, fishing, agriculture, and, gathering, the, appalachian, landscape, provided, a, rich, tapestry, of, flora, and, fauna, which, indigenous, communities, learned, to, harness, for, their, sustenance, and, well, being, the, appalachian, mountains, served, as, a, conduit, for, trade, networks, connecting, distant, indigenous, communities, through, intricate, trails, these, trade, routes, facilitated, the, exchange, of, goods, ideas, and, cultural, practices, across, vast, distances, this, network, fostered, a, sense, of, shared, identity, among, diverse, indigenous, groups, transcending, geographical, boundaries, during, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, european, explorers, embarked, on, voyages, of, discovery, across, the, atlantic, ocean, while, seeking, new, trade, routes, and, riches, they, encountered, the, vast, landmass, of, north, america, including, the, appalachian, regions, the, mountains, posed, a, formidable, geographical, obstacle, that, european, explorers, had, to, navigate, the, french, british, and, spanish, were, among, the, major, powers, vying, for, dominance, in, the, new, world, and, their, interactions, with, indigenous, communities, and, the, appalachian, landscape, shaped, the, course, of, history, the, appalachian, highlands, and, lowlands, became, focal, points, for, european, colonial, expansion, french, and, british, explorers, traversed, the, appalachian, mountains, as, they, established, footholds, in, north, america, the, french, established, settlements, in, the, great, lakes, region, and, canada, while, the, british, colonies, stretched, along, the, eastern, seaboard, of, what, would, become, the, united, states, the, territorial, ambitions, of, european, powers, set, the, stage, for, later, conflicts, such, as, the, french, and, indian, war, the, british, proclamation, of, 1763, holds, significance, in, both, canadian, and, american, histories, in, the, united, states, the, proclamation, aimed, to, curb, westward, expansion, beyond, the, appalachian, mountains, to, avoid, conflicts, with, indigenous, nations, leading, to, tensions, between, american, colonists, and, the, british, crown, and, contributing, to, the, drive, for, independence, in, canada, the, proclamation, provided, a, framework, for, governing, newly, acquired, french, territories, including, quebec, to, ensure, stability, and, control, over, the, region, the, ramifications, of, the, proclamation, were, multifaceted, reflecting, the, complex, dynamics, of, colonial, governance, and, indigenous, relations, the, appalachian, mountains, in, both, countries, nurtured, unique, cultural, identities, that, persist, to, this, day, the, isolation, of, these, mountainous, regions, allowed, for, the, development, of, distinctive, music, folklore, and, traditions, appalachian, music, played, a, significant, role, in, the, broader, evolution, of, american, and, canadian, music, genres, while, each, side, of, the, border, has, its, own, cultural, expressions, the, shared, geographical, features, and, historical, interactions, contributed, to, common, threads, of, self, reliance, resilience, and, connection, to, nature, that, characterize, appalachian, culture, european, exploration, of, the, appalachian, regions, contributed, to, the, mapping, and, understanding, of, the, area, s, geographical, features, explorers, documented, the, rugged, terrain, dense, forests, and, abundant, natural, resources, their, observations, shaped, the, perceptions, of, the, appalachian, landscape, and, influenced, subsequent, settlement, patterns, and, resource, utilization, the, range, posed, significant, barriers, to, westward, expansion, leaving, an, indelible, mark, on, colonization, efforts, the, cumberland, gap, a, prominent, geographic, feature, played, a, pivotal, role, in, westward, expansion, in, the, united, states, this, passage, through, the, appalachian, mountains, provided, a, route, for, pioneers, seeking, new, opportunities, beyond, the, mountains, similarly, canada, had, its, own, geographical, passage, the, gasp, peninsula, which, facilitated, exploration, and, trade, in, the, canadian, appalachian, region, these, passages, were, vital, gateways, that, shaped, the, movement,
