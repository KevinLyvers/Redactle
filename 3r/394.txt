of, new, guinea, with, an, elevation, of, 4, 884, m, 16, 024, ft, is, the, highest, mountain, peak, of, an, island, on, earth, and, the, highest, peak, in, indonesia, the, mountain, is, located, in, the, sudirman, range, of, the, highlands, of, mimika, regency, central, papua, indonesia, puncak, jaya, is, ranked, 5th, in, the, world, by, topographic, isolation, when, regarding, new, guinea, as, part, of, the, australian, continent, in, a, biogeographical, sense, puncak, jaya, can, be, considered, the, highest, peak, in, all, of, oceania, with, its, elevation, exceeding, those, of, the, highest, peaks, in, the, nearby, nations, of, papua, new, guinea, mount, wilhelm, new, zealand, aoraki, mount, cook, and, australia, mount, kosciuszko, puncak, jaya, is, therefore, often, listed, as, one, of, the, seven, summits, however, since, puncak, jaya, is, in, western, new, guinea, an, area, administered, by, indonesia, and, therefore, geopolitically, part, of, southeast, asia, the, peak, can, also, be, considered, the, 8th, highest, mountain, in, this, region, after, hkakabo, razi, and, six, others, in, kachin, state, myanmar, the, massive, open, cut, grasberg, gold, and, copper, mine, the, world, s, second, largest, gold, mine, is, four, kilometres, 2, 1, 2, miles, west, of, puncak, jaya, other, summits, are, east, carstensz, peak, 4, 808, m, sumantri, 4, 870, m, and, ngga, pulu, 4, 863, m, other, names, include, nemangkawi, in, the, amungkal, language, carstensz, toppen, and, gunung, soekarno, it, is, also, the, highest, point, between, the, himalayas, and, the, andes, the, name, of, the, mountain, in, the, indigenous, amungme, peoples, language, is, nemangkawi, ninggok, meaning, peak, of, the, white, arrow, the, name, puncak, jaya, is, indonesian, for, glorious, peak, it, is, also, known, as, the, carstensz, pyramid, mount, jayawijaya, or, mount, carstensz, the, highlands, surrounding, the, peak, were, inhabited, before, european, contact, and, the, peak, is, known, as, nemangkawi, in, amungkal, puncak, jaya, was, named, carstensz, pyramid, after, dutch, explorer, jan, carstenszoon, who, was, the, first, european, to, sight, the, glaciers, on, the, peak, of, the, mountain, on, a, rare, clear, day, in, 1623, the, sighting, went, unverified, for, over, two, centuries, and, carstensz, was, ridiculed, in, europe, when, he, said, he, had, seen, snow, near, the, equator, it, appeared, on, maps, of, the, time, as, sneebergh, the, snowfield, of, puncak, trikora, 170, km, 106, mi, east, of, here, was, reached, as, early, as, 1909, by, a, dutch, explorer, hendrik, albert, lorentz, with, six, of, his, dayak, kenyah, porters, recruited, from, the, apo, kayan, in, borneo, the, predecessor, of, the, lorentz, national, park, which, encompasses, the, carstensz, range, was, established, in, 1919, following, the, report, of, this, expedition, in, 1936, the, dutch, carstensz, expedition, unable, to, establish, definitively, which, of, the, three, summits, was, the, highest, attempted, to, climb, each, anton, colijn, jean, jacques, dozy, and, frits, wissel, reached, both, the, glacier, covered, east, carstensz, and, ngga, pulu, summits, on, december, 5, but, due, to, bad, weather, failed, in, their, attempts, to, climb, the, bare, carstensz, pyramid, because, of, extensive, snow, melt, ngga, pulu, has, become, a, 4, 862, m, 15, 951, ft, subsidiary, peak, but, it, has, been, estimated, that, in, 1936, when, glaciers, still, covered, 13, km, 2, 5, 0, sq, mi, of, the, mountain, see, map, ngga, pulu, was, indeed, the, highest, summit, reaching, over, 4, 900, m, 16, 100, ft, the, now, highest, carstensz, pyramid, summit, was, not, climbed, until, 1962, by, an, expedition, led, by, the, austrian, mountaineer, heinrich, harrer, new, zealand, mountaineer, philip, temple, australian, rock, climber, russell, kippax, and, dutch, patrol, officer, albertus, bert, huizenga, temple, had, previously, led, an, expedition, into, the, area, and, pioneered, the, access, route, to, the, mountains, when, indonesia, took, control, of, the, province, in, 1963, the, peak, was, renamed, poentja, soekarno, simplified, indonesian, puncak, sukarno, or, sukarno, peak, after, the, then, president, of, indonesia, sukarno, later, this, was, changed, to, puncak, jaya, due, to, the, subsequent, de, sukarnoization, puncak, means, peak, or, mountain, and, jaya, means, victory, victorious, or, glorious, the, name, carstensz, pyramid, is, still, used, among, mountaineers, puncak, jaya, is, the, highest, point, on, the, central, range, which, was, created, in, the, late, miocene, melanesian, orogeny, caused, by, an, oblique, collision, between, the, australian, and, pacific, plates, and, is, made, of, middle, miocene, limestones, access, to, the, peak, requires, a, government, permit, the, mountain, was, closed, to, tourists, and, climbers, between, 1995, and, 2005, as, of, 2006, access, is, possible, through, various, adventure, tourism, agencies, despite, being, among, the, lowest, of, the, seven, summits, puncak, jaya, is, considered, to, be, a, technically, difficult, climb, requiring, extensive, planning, acclimatisation, mountaineering, skills, and, support, services, due, to, its, remoteness, and, sheer, limestone, faces, located, in, an, isolated, area, of, central, papua, there, are, no, nearby, facilities, and, climbers, have, the, option, to, take, a, helicopter, to, the, base, camp, and, reach, the, summit, within, three, to, four, days, or, spend, an, additional, four, to, five, days, to, trek, to, base, camp, from, the, nearest, town, sugapa, while, puncak, jaya, s, peak, is, free, of, ice, there, are, several, glaciers, on, its, slopes, including, the, carstensz, glacier, west, northwall, firn, east, northwall, firn, and, the, recently, vanished, meren, glacier, in, the, meren, valley, meren, is, dutch, for, lakes, being, equatorial, there, is, little, variation, in, the, mean, temperature, during, the, year, around, 0, 5, c, and, the, glaciers, fluctuate, on, a, seasonal, basis, only, slightly, however, analysis, of, the, extent, of, these, rare, equatorial, glaciers, from, historical, records, show, significant, retreat, since, the, 1850s, around, the, time, of, the, little, ice, age, maximum, which, primarily, affected, the, northern, hemisphere, indicating, a, regional, warming, of, around, 0, 6, c, 1, 1, f, per, century, between, 1850, and, 1972, the, glacier, on, puncak, trikora, in, the, maoke, mountains, disappeared, completely, some, time, between, 1939, and, 1962, since, the, 1970s, evidence, from, satellite, imagery, indicates, the, puncak, jaya, glaciers, have, been, retreating, rapidly, the, meren, glacier, melted, away, sometime, between, 1994, and, 2000, an, expedition, led, by, paleoclimatologist, lonnie, thompson, in, 2010, found, that, the, glaciers, are, disappearing, at, a, rate, of, seven, metres, 23, ft, thickness, per, year, and, in, 2018, they, were, predicted, to, vanish, in, the, 2020s, puncak, jaya, is, one, of, the, more, demanding, climbs, in, one, version, of, the, seven, summits, despite, having, the, lowest, elevation, it, is, held, to, have, the, highest, technical, rating, though, not, the, greatest, physical, demands, of, that, list, s, ascents, the, standard, route, to, climb, the, peak, from, its, base, camp, is, up, the, north, face, and, along, the, summit, ridge, which, is, all, hard, rock, surface, despite, the, large, mine, the, area, is, highly, inaccessible, to, hikers, and, the, general, public, the, standard, route, to, access, base, camp, as, of, 2013, is, to, fly, into, the, nearest, major, town, with, an, airport, timika, and, then, take, a, small, aircraft, over, the, mountain, range, and, onto, an, unimproved, runway, at, one, of, the, local, villages, far, down, from, the, peak, it, is, then, typically, a, five, day, hike, via, the, jungle, route, to, the, base, camp, through, very, dense, rainforest, and, with, regular, rainfall, making, the, approach, probably, the, most, miserable, of, the, seven, summits, rain, during, most, days, of, the, hike, inbound, and, out, are, not, uncommon, unlike, the, other, seven, summits, if, one, sustains, an, injury, on, the, inbound, hike, there, is, little, or, no, ability, to, get, rescued, via, helicopter, anyone, injured, must, evacuate, by, foot, over, very, difficult, and, slippery, terrain, the, descent, from, the, peak, s, base, camp, can, take, three, to, four, days, anecdotally, it, appears, most, injuries, occur, during, the, descent, due, to, a, combination, of, exhaustion, and, difficulty, controlling, hiking, speed, on, the, wet, and, slippery, terrain, an, additional, complication, is, relatively, common, work, strikes, by, the, climbing, porters, that, accompany, most, expeditions, occasionally, halting, their, work, to, demand, and, usually, receive, higher, pay, before, agreeing, to, continue, the, one, day, summit, bid, is, technically, challenging, for, those, with, little, rock, climbing, experience, and, it, can, be, quite, cold, with, temperatures, at, or, below, freezing, near, the, summit, patches, of, snow, sometimes, appear, on, the, route, up, or, on, the, ropes, of, the, tyrolean, traverse, just, below, the, summit
