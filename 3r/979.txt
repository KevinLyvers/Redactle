metropolis, and, also, the, seventh, largest, city, in, iran, the, city, is, 140, km, 87, mi, to, the, south, of, tehran, and, on, the, banks, of, the, qom, river, qom, is, considered, holy, in, shi, a, islam, as, it, is, the, site, of, the, shrine, of, fatimah, bint, musa, sister, of, imam, ali, ibn, musa, rida, persian, imam, reza, 789, 816, the, city, is, the, largest, center, for, shi, a, scholarship, in, the, world, and, is, a, significant, destination, of, pilgrimage, with, around, twenty, million, pilgrims, visiting, the, city, every, year, the, majority, being, iranians, but, also, other, shi, a, muslims, from, all, around, the, world, qom, has, developed, into, a, lively, industrial, center, owing, in, part, to, its, proximity, to, tehran, it, is, a, regional, center, for, the, distribution, of, petroleum, and, petroleum, products, and, a, natural, gas, pipeline, from, bandar, anzali, and, tehran, and, a, crude, oil, pipeline, from, tehran, run, through, qom, to, the, abadan, refinery, on, the, persian, gulf, qom, gained, additional, prosperity, when, oil, was, discovered, at, sarajeh, near, the, city, in, 1956, and, a, large, refinery, was, built, between, qom, and, tehran, some, researchers, have, considered, the, word, kom, in, the, ancient, name, of, komidan, komiran, to, mean, city, and, believe, that, there, is, a, lexical, connection, between, the, words, komiran, shemiran, near, tehran, tehran, chamran, in, saveh, areas, and, iran, and, they, considered, the, old, name, of, qom, to, be, komiran, in, the, meaning, of, iran, city, the, present, town, of, qom, in, central, iran, dates, back, to, ancient, times, its, pre, islamic, history, can, be, partially, documented, although, the, earlier, epochs, remain, unclear, excavations, at, tepe, sialk, indicate, that, the, region, had, been, settled, since, ancient, times, ghirshman, and, vanden, berghe, and, more, recent, surveys, have, revealed, traces, of, large, inhabited, places, south, of, qom, dating, from, the, 4th, and, 1st, millennium, bc, while, nothing, is, known, about, the, area, from, elamite, medes, and, achaemenid, times, there, are, significant, archeological, remains, from, the, seleucid, and, parthian, epochs, of, which, the, ruins, of, khurha, about, 70, kilometres, or, 43, miles, southwest, of, qom, are, the, most, famous, and, important, remnants, their, dating, and, function, have, instigated, long, and, controversial, debates, and, interpretations, for, they, have, been, interpreted, and, explained, variously, as, the, remains, of, a, sasanian, temple, or, of, a, seleucid, dionysian, temple, or, of, a, parthian, complex, its, true, function, is, still, a, matter, of, dispute, but, the, contributions, by, wolfram, kleiss, point, to, a, parthian, palace, that, served, as, a, station, on, the, nearby, highway, and, was, used, until, sasanian, times, the, recently, published, results, of, the, excavations, carried, out, in, 1955, by, iranian, archeologists, have, however, revived, the, old, thesis, of, a, seleucid, religious, building, besides, khurha, which, is, already, mentioned, as, khor, abad, at, qomi, in, the, 9th, century, the, region, has, turned, up, a, few, other, remnants, from, this, epoch, including, the, four, parthian, heads, found, near, qom, now, kept, in, the, national, museum, of, iran, in, tehran, qomi, names, parthian, personalities, as, founders, of, villages, in, the, qom, area, the, possible, mention, of, qom, in, the, form, of, greek, names, in, two, ancient, geographical, works, the, tabula, peutingera, and, ptolemy, s, geographical, tables, remains, doubtful, the, sasanian, epoch, offers, many, archeological, findings, and, remnants, besides, the, fact, that, various, sources, mention, qom, the, most, interesting, building, from, an, archeological, point, of, view, is, the, qal, a, ye, do, tar, in, qom, itself, which, was, long, thought, to, have, served, religious, purposes, while, more, recent, research, points, to, an, administrative, use, the, wider, surroundings, of, qom, also, contain, numerous, traces, from, palaces, religious, military, and, administrative, buildings, some, of, these, are, mentioned, by, qomi, who, also, names, many, more, fire, temples, in, the, urban, area, of, present, qom, and, its, region, of, which, no, archeological, traces, are, left, although, the, location, of, one, fire, temple, can, probably, be, equated, with, today, s, masjed, e, em, m, in, the, city, according, to, qomi, the, most, important, fire, temple, of, the, area, stood, in, the, nearby, village, of, dizijan, t, ri, e, qom, and, some, other, sources, also, speak, of, genuine, historical, figures, of, the, sasanian, epoch, in, connection, with, qom, and, its, region, they, shed, new, light, on, the, time, of, the, seizure, of, power, by, the, first, sasanian, king, ardashir, i, who, fought, his, decisive, battles, near, qom, and, the, collapse, of, the, sasanian, empire, which, is, extensively, reported, by, ebn, a, am, kufi, and, the, neh, yat, al, erab, and, names, a, certain, rz, d, as, the, satrap, of, the, region, the, existence, of, an, urban, settlement, in, the, sasanian, epoch, is, furthermore, verified, by, middle, persian, sources, literary, sources, inscriptions, and, seals, that, mention, in, the, time, of, shapur, i, and, kaw, d, i, the, names, godm, n, gom, n, and, r, n, win, n, rd, kaw, d, both, of, which, could, be, identified, as, qom, altogether, one, can, assume, that, qom, functioned, as, a, small, administrative, unit, throughout, the, whole, sasanian, era, probably, the, urban, structure, of, the, sasanian, settlement, of, qom, can, be, compared, with, the, type, of, city, of, ctesiphon, or, mad, en, and, consisted, of, several, villages, and, little, towns, with, abara, tej, n, mamajj, n, and, jamkar, n, as, the, bigger, settlements, that, were, loosely, connected, by, defense, installations, it, is, difficult, to, decipher, the, actual, process, of, the, arab, conquest, of, qom, from, the, extant, arabic, sources, according, to, bal, ori, the, first, tentative, conquest, of, qom, took, place, in, 23, 644, by, abu, musa, ashaari, after, a, few, days, of, fighting, although, abu, musa, s, route, through, western, persia, as, narrated, by, bal, ori, appears, somewhat, confusing, it, remains, unclear, who, the, defenders, of, qom, were, probably, fleeing, sasanian, nobles, and, local, soldiers, returning, from, the, great, battles, against, the, arabs, formed, the, core, of, the, resistance, the, area, remained, largely, untouched, for, 60, years, after, the, initial, conquest, and, was, probably, administered, from, isfahan, the, first, permanent, settlement, of, arab, settlers, in, qom, took, place, during, the, revolts, of, mukhtar, al, thaqafi, and, mo, arref, b, mo, ira, b, a, ba, in, 66, 77, 685, 96, when, small, groups, of, refugees, moved, there, and, qom, itself, was, affected, by, the, fighting, between, the, umayyad, state, power, and, the, rebels, the, decisive, step, for, the, later, urban, development, of, qom, occurred, when, a, group, of, ashaari, arabs, came, to, the, area, these, ashaaries, originated, in, yemen, and, the, first, important, figure, among, them, was, the, first, conqueror, of, the, area, of, qom, the, above, mentioned, abu, musa, ashaari, abd, all, h, b, sa, d, and, a, wa, b, sa, d, were, grandsons, of, abi, musa, s, nephew, and, led, the, group, of, ashaaries, that, emigrated, from, kufa, to, the, region, of, qom, it, is, not, exactly, clear, why, they, migrated, but, it, might, have, also, been, a, general, opposition, to, the, umayyad, dynasty, a, central, element, was, the, early, contact, with, the, leading, local, zoroastrian, persian, noble, yazdanfadar, as, the, arabs, required, a, great, deal, of, pasture, for, their, large, herds, of, cattle, and, were, much, wealthier, than, the, local, persians, they, slowly, started, to, buy, land, and, take, over, more, villages, the, decisive, step, for, controlling, the, area, was, the, elimination, of, the, local, persian, noble, class, that, took, place, after, the, death, of, yazdanfadar, in, 733, although, a, few, names, of, governors, and, their, tax, assessments, are, known, from, the, time, after, the, administrative, independence, the, death, of, f, timah, bint, m, s, the, sister, of, the, eighth, imam, of, shias, ali, al, ridha, in, the, city, in, 201, 816, 17, proved, to, be, of, great, importance, for, the, later, history, of, qom, f, timah, bint, m, s, died, while, following, her, brother, to, khorasan, a, region, in, northern, iran, the, place, of, her, entombment, developed, from, 869, 70, into, a, building, that, was, transformed, over, time, into, today, s, magnificent, and, economically, important, sanctuary, in, 825, 26, a, major, rebellion, against, the, tax, regulations, of, the, caliphate, broke, out, in, qom, it, was, caused, by, the, refusal, of, the, caliph, al, ma, mun, to, lower, the, yearly, tax, assessment, as, he, had, done, in, ray, the, revolt, was, led, by, an, ashaari, named, yahya, ibn, emran, maintaining, that, taxes, should, not, be, paid, to, an, unlawful, ruler, yahya, was, killed, by, troops, sent, by, the, caliph, and, the, citizens, were, severely, punished, the, taxes, were, raised, from, 2, million, to, 7, million, dirhams, two, years, later, the, taxes, were, again, raised, by, 700, 000, dirham, by, the, ashaari, governor, ali, ibn, isa, who, was, subsequently, deposed, because, he, was, strongly, rejected, by, the, inhabitants, of, qom, but, in, 833, ali, returned, to, the, post, of, governor, wali, and, forcefully, collected, tax, debts, that, were, laid, upon, him, by, the, caliph, he, destroyed, parts, of, qom, and, handed, over, a, wanted, rebel, to, caliphal, authorities, under, al, mo, tasem, between, 839, 42, two, contradicting, tax, assessments, were, carried, out, under, turbulent, circumstances, which, amounted, to, a, sum, of, 5, million, dirhams, the, names, of, those, involved, have, survived, the, move, of, a, hadith, transmitter, from, kufa, to, qom, which, took, place, probably, in, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, indicates, the, increased, importance, of, qom, as, a, center, of, shia, learning, at, about, the, same, time, another, military, attack, on, the, city, occurred, in, 254, 868, when, mofle, the, turkish, officer, of, the, caliph, al, mosta, in, executed, some, of, its, inhabitants, because, of, the, city, s, refusal, to, pay, taxes, mofle, became, governor, of, qom, and, lasted, in, that, position, for, at, least, five, years, during, his, governorship, important, alids, moved, to, qom, and, there, are, references, to, close, contacts, between, the, representative, of, the, 11th, shia, s, imam, hassan, al, askari, in, qom, and, other, qomis, the, representative, a, mad, b, es, q, was, at, the, same, time, administrator, of, the, f, ema, sanctuary, and, the, agent, wakil, responsible, for, the, pensions, of, the, alids, the, first, friday, mosque, in, qom, was, built, in, 878, 79, on, the, site, of, a, fire, temple, although, there, are, also, confusing, reports, concerning, a, possible, earlier, friday, mosque, in, 881, 82, qom, was, occupied, by, the, turkish, military, leader, edgu, tegin, arabic, yadkutakin, b, as, takin, or, a, kutakin, who, tried, to, collect, the, tax, arrears, for, seven, years, which, partially, ruined, the, guarantors, some, of, whom, are, known, of, these, taxes, at, about, the, same, time, the, early, orthodox, shias, achieved, their, victory, in, the, town, in, 893, 94, at, the, latest, all, extremists, ol, t, were, driven, out, of, town, by, the, leading, shia, shaikh, of, qom, a, mad, b, mo, ammed, b, isa, ashaari, probably, one, year, later, in, 1895, the, famous, islamic, mystic, osayn, b, man, ur, allaj, stayed, in, qom, where, he, was, arrested, from, 895, 96, onwards, the, history, of, qom, was, connected, with, a, family, of, turkish, military, leaders, from, the, army, of, the, caliph, al, mu, tadid, including, the, governor, berun, birun, in, the, same, year, berun, destroyed, a, big, and, probably, still, active, fire, temple, located, on, the, territory, of, the, evolving, city, and, probably, opposite, today, s, sanctuary, of, f, timah, bint, m, s, in, these, unstable, political, times, qom, was, visited, by, the, vizier, of, al, mo, tazed, obayd, allah, ibn, solayman, and, two, tax, assessments, were, organized, an, administrative, peculiarity, of, qom, was, put, to, an, end, at, about, the, same, time, to, wit, the, independent, appointment, of, judges, through, the, arab, inhabitants, of, qom, until, the, time, of, al, moktafi, which, together, with, the, dispatch, of, a, joint, arab, persian, delegation, to, the, vizier, amid, ibn, abbas, indicate, the, end, of, the, elevated, position, of, the, arabs, in, qom, the, period, of, the, governor, abbas, ibn, amr, ganawi, 292, 96, 904, 09, is, remarkable, for, the, presence, of, non, twelver, shias, in, qom, and, the, establishment, of, the, office, of, the, jahba, financial, officer, as, the, tax, broker, for, the, city, which, fostered, local, self, determination, in, 909, hosayn, ibn, hamdan, ibn, hamdun, was, appointed, governor, of, qom, and, k, n, by, the, caliph, al, moqtader, and, had, to, assist, the, caliph, s, army, against, the, saffarids, in, fars, altogether, he, stayed, in, power, only, for, two, years, before, he, had, to, return, to, baghdad, in, the, years, 301, 913, 14, to, 315, 927, the, people, of, qom, had, besides, another, tax, assessment, meanwhile, the, eighth, a, caliphal, intervention, that, resulted, in, the, appointment, of, a, governor, to, stabilize, the, administrative, grip, over, the, region, this, move, caused, more, unrest, and, affected, the, balance, of, power, in, an, area, that, was, disputed, between, the, powers, of, the, time, daylamites, samanids, beginning, in, 316, 928, qom, fell, into, the, sphere, of, interest, of, daylami, warlords, and, was, relieved, from, the, direct, authority, of, the, caliph, although, it, changed, hands, several, times, between, 928, and, 943, the, daylamites, brutally, exploited, the, city, through, harsh, taxes, with, the, firm, establishment, of, buyids, control, from, 340, 951, 52, on, the, political, circumstances, were, less, troubled, than, before, although, the, economic, situation, deteriorated, no, outstanding, events, are, reported, for, the, relatively, stable, political, period, until, 988, 89, but, qom, seems, to, have, been, isolated, inside, persia, because, of, its, shia, creed, at, the, same, time, the, fatima, sanctuary, was, enlarged, and, the, number, of, sayyeds, residing, in, qom, reached, a, considerable, number, in, 373, 984, qom, and, its, environs, were, impacted, by, the, revolt, of, the, kurdish, mo, ammad, barzik, ni, against, the, buyid, fakr, al, dawla, the, population, amounted, to, 50, 000, inhabitants, at, the, most, and, consisted, of, persians, and, arabs, who, had, adopted, the, persian, of, the, time, as, their, language, and, many, social, customs, from, the, persians, whose, proportion, was, probably, smaller, than, the, arabs, the, kurds, lived, in, the, countryside, to, the, west, the, twelver, shia, constituted, the, great, majority, of, the, population, and, many, important, shia, scholars, of, the, time, came, from, qom, or, lived, there, as, many, as, 331, male, alids, lived, in, qom, in, 988, 89, and, they, produced, a, good, number, of, community, leaders, and, there, is, also, mention, of, one, prominent, female, alid, besides, f, timah, bint, m, s, these, alids, descended, from, the, imams, and, were, supported, by, pensions, apart, from, the, shia, mainstream, other, shia, sects, existed, in, the, city, and, one, can, also, assume, the, presence, of, sunnies, emmis, or, followers, of, other, revealed, religions, jews, christians, and, zoroastrians, must, have, lived, in, the, city, too, as, the, payment, of, poll, tax, jezya, indicates, although, their, number, can, only, be, very, roughly, estimated, at, a, few, thousand, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, and, must, have, shrunk, drastically, in, the, 10th, century, the, majority, of, these, non, muslims, were, zoroastrians, who, made, their, living, mostly, as, farmers, jews, must, have, lived, in, qom, as, well, but, information, on, them, is, scant, it, is, striking, that, the, formerly, dominant, ashaaries, had, lost, their, leading, positions, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, this, points, at, a, new, social, situation, that, allowed, assimilated, persians, to, join, the, local, establishment, the, city, s, topography, in, the, 10th, century, still, reflected, the, evolutionary, merging, of, the, original, six, villages, these, were, still, separated, by, fields, the, town, center, was, located, in, the, village, of, mamajj, n, which, was, connected, to, other, parts, of, the, city, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, by, four, bridges, there, were, about, eight, squares, whose, function, is, not, clear, and, three, mosques, within, the, city, there, is, almost, no, information, about, madrasas, the, sanctuary, must, have, still, been, quite, small, as, only, two, cupolas, are, mentioned, a, bazaar, and, bathhouses, must, have, existed, too, as, well, as, certain, administrative, buildings, prison, mint, five, bigger, and, eight, smaller, roads, indicate, good, traffic, connections, which, were, supported, by, at, least, three, or, maybe, even, nine, city, gates, qom, was, then, in, a, difficult, economic, and, social, position, many, houses, inside, the, city, as, well, as, bridges, and, mills, were, ruined, and, the, roads, and, agriculture, were, suffering, from, an, insecure, situation, this, has, to, be, attributed, to, difficult, social, circumstances, and, excessive, taxation, the, water, supply, seems, to, have, been, satisfactory, and, the, ashaaries, seem, to, have, undertaken, continuous, renovation, works, on, the, irrigation, channels, between, 733, and, 900, the, a, aris, were, also, the, proprietors, of, the, water, rights, which, were, safeguarded, in, the, water, authority, div, n, e, b, that, regulated, the, water, shares, the, system, made, the, a, aris, the, wealthiest, inhabitants, of, qom, and, stayed, in, place, until, 347, 958, 59, when, they, were, expropriated, by, the, buyids, which, consequently, brought, about, a, decline, in, the, whole, system, of, irrigation, although, there, were, attempts, at, restoration, in, 371, 981, 82, only, three, of, originally, twenty, one, channels, had, flowing, water, which, meant, enough, drinking, water, was, supplied, for, the, population, but, the, available, amount, could, not, have, been, adequate, for, agricultural, purposes, altogether, the, state, of, cultivation, in, qom, seems, to, have, resembled, that, of, the, other, regions, of, persia, although, the, thirty, different, crops, and, plants, are, only, indirectly, mentioned, in, connection, with, the, tax, assessments, the, soil, is, reported, to, have, good, quality, and, produced, big, quantities, of, food, little, is, known, about, animal, husbandry, in, the, region, but, the, considerable, number, of, fifty, one, mills, existed, of, which, a, fifth, was, in, decay, legends, speak, of, mineral, deposits, and, mines, of, silver, iron, gold, and, lead, while, kurds, seem, to, have, produced, salt, from, a, lake, nearby, see, qom, lake, the, production, of, chairs, textiles, and, saddle, equipment, indicates, craftsmanship, the, city, s, taxation, has, to, be, distinguished, between, the, more, proper, rule, of, the, abbasid, tax, bureaucracy, and, the, time, of, the, deylamid, warlords, where, rules, were, bent, arbitrarily, a, stunning, diversity, of, taxes, is, known, often, meant, to, serve, the, abbasid, bureaucracy, and, the, deylamid, and, buyid, war, machinery, but, the, karaj, land, tax, which, was, composed, of, many, different, separate, sums, was, the, most, important, single, tax, existing, in, qom, at, least, since, post, sasanian, times, within, the, known, 18, tax, figures, ranging, over, 160, years, there, are, great, differences, and, the, tax, figures, vary, from, 8, million, to, 2, million, dirhams, with, a, mean, value, at, around, 3, million, in, taxation, qom, always, followed, the, solar, calendar, with, its, own, local, variation, starting, from, the, death, of, the, sasanian, yazdegerd, iii, a, highly, differentiated, tax, administration, existed, and, is, known, in, great, detail, 24, tax, collectors, omm, l, are, listed, from, 189, 804, 05, to, 371, 981, 82, plus, two, jahaba, a, who, acted, as, mediators, after, the, attempt, to, enforce, collective, responsibility, by, the, taxpayers, had, failed, the, information, in, the, t, ri, e, qom, on, taxation, also, mention, by, name, 21, tax, districts, ras, tiq, in, the, region, with, 900, villages, little, is, known, about, the, time, until, the, period, of, seljuki, dominance, in, 387, 997, qom, became, involved, in, internal, buyid, quarrels, and, was, subsequently, unsuccessfully, besieged, in, 418, 1027, 28, qom, fell, under, the, rule, of, ahryu, from, the, kakuyid, dynasty, and, a, few, years, later, 1030, 40, it, became, part, of, the, ghaznavid, domain, the, seljuki, did, not, occupy, qom, at, once, but, left, the, town, and, jeb, l, in, kakuyid, hands, for, ten, years, from, 442, 1050, 51, on, the, city, was, under, seljuk, rule, and, nothing, is, known, about, its, fate, until, 487, 1094, afterwards, the, growing, instability, of, the, seljuk, empire, involved, qom, in, the, power, struggles, between, the, competing, seljuk, factions, in, jeb, l, and, the, city, changed, hands, many, times, the, most, stable, period, seems, to, have, been, the, 14, years, 513, 27, 1119, 33, when, qom, lay, in, sanjar, s, sphere, of, power, and, witnessed, the, construction, of, a, second, friday, mosque, qom, enjoyed, relative, prosperity, in, its, economy, in, the, seljuk, period, the, rigidly, sunni, seljuks, seem, to, have, practiced, a, pragmatic, policy, and, one, of, the, main, sources, of, this, time, abd, al, jalil, qazvini, speaks, of, good, relations, between, the, famous, vizier, nizam, al, mulk, and, seljuk, sultans, on, the, one, hand, and, members, of, the, local, nobility, on, the, other, sultans, reportedly, visited, the, sanctuary, although, no, specific, sultan, is, mentioned, by, name, and, in, general, no, religiously, motivated, punitive, action, against, qom, is, known, to, have, taken, place, under, seljuk, rule, a, considerable, number, of, religious, buildings, were, erected, at, least, ten, madrasas, are, known, by, name, two, friday, mosques, seem, to, have, existed, in, seljuk, times, the, old, one, was, renovated, and, a, new, one, located, outside, of, the, town, area, was, built, in, 528, 1133, 34, by, the, order, of, sultan, togrel, ii, persian, qom, must, have, expanded, during, this, period, but, precise, reasons, for, its, prosperity, are, not, known, a, family, of, osaynid, alids, was, influential, and,
