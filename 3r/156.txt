the, colorado, river, spanish, r, o, colorado, is, one, of, the, principal, rivers, along, with, the, rio, grande, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, in, northern, mexico, the, 1, 450, mile, long, 2, 330, km, river, the, 5th, longest, in, the, united, states, drains, an, expansive, arid, watershed, that, encompasses, parts, of, seven, u, s, states, and, two, mexican, states, the, name, colorado, derives, from, the, spanish, language, for, colored, reddish, due, to, its, heavy, silt, load, starting, in, the, central, rocky, mountains, of, colorado, it, flows, generally, southwest, across, the, colorado, plateau, and, through, the, grand, canyon, before, reaching, lake, mead, on, the, arizona, nevada, border, where, it, turns, south, toward, the, international, border, after, entering, mexico, the, colorado, approaches, the, mostly, dry, colorado, river, delta, at, the, tip, of, the, gulf, of, california, between, baja, california, and, sonora, known, for, its, dramatic, canyons, whitewater, rapids, and, eleven, u, s, national, parks, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, are, a, vital, source, of, water, for, 40, million, people, an, extensive, system, of, dams, reservoirs, and, aqueducts, divert, almost, its, entire, flow, for, agricultural, irrigation, and, urban, water, supply, its, large, flow, and, steep, gradient, are, used, to, generate, hydroelectricity, meeting, peaking, power, demands, in, much, of, the, intermountain, west, intensive, water, consumption, has, dried, up, the, lower, 100, miles, 160, km, of, the, river, which, has, rarely, reached, the, sea, since, the, 1960s, native, americans, have, inhabited, the, colorado, river, basin, for, at, least, 8, 000, years, starting, around, 1, ce, large, agriculture, based, societies, were, established, but, a, combination, of, drought, and, poor, land, use, practices, led, to, their, collapse, in, the, 1300s, their, descendants, include, tribes, such, as, the, puebloans, while, others, including, the, navajo, settled, in, the, colorado, basin, after, the, 1000s, in, the, 1500s, spanish, explorers, began, mapping, and, claiming, the, watershed, which, became, part, of, mexico, upon, winning, its, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, even, after, most, of, the, watershed, became, us, territory, in, 1846, much, of, the, river, s, course, remained, unknown, several, expeditions, charted, the, colorado, in, the, mid, 19th, century, one, of, which, led, by, john, wesley, powell, was, the, first, to, run, the, rapids, of, the, grand, canyon, large, scale, settlement, of, the, lower, basin, began, in, the, mid, to, late, 1800s, with, steamboats, sailing, from, the, gulf, of, california, to, landings, along, the, river, that, linked, to, wagon, roads, to, the, interior, starting, in, the, 1860s, gold, and, silver, strikes, drew, prospectors, to, the, upper, colorado, river, basin, large, scale, river, management, began, in, the, early, 1900s, with, major, guidelines, established, in, a, series, of, international, and, us, interstate, treaties, known, as, the, law, of, the, river, the, us, federal, government, constructed, most, of, the, major, dams, and, aqueducts, between, 1910, and, 1970, the, largest, hoover, dam, was, completed, in, 1935, numerous, water, projects, have, also, involved, state, and, local, governments, with, all, of, their, waters, fully, allocated, both, the, colorado, and, the, neighboring, rio, grande, are, now, considered, among, the, most, controlled, and, litigated, river, systems, in, the, world, since, 2000, extended, drought, has, conflicted, with, increasing, demands, for, colorado, river, water, and, the, level, of, human, development, and, control, of, the, river, continues, to, generate, controversy, the, colorado, begins, at, la, poudre, pass, in, the, never, summer, mountains, in, rocky, mountain, national, park, 10, 184, ft, 3, 104, m, above, sea, level, after, a, short, run, south, the, river, turns, west, below, grand, lake, the, largest, natural, lake, in, the, state, for, the, first, 250, miles, 400, km, of, its, course, the, colorado, carves, its, way, through, the, mountainous, western, slope, a, sparsely, populated, region, defined, by, the, portion, of, the, state, west, of, the, continental, divide, as, it, flows, southwest, it, gains, strength, from, many, small, tributaries, as, well, as, larger, ones, including, the, blue, eagle, and, roaring, fork, rivers, after, passing, through, de, beque, canyon, the, colorado, emerges, from, the, rockies, into, the, grand, valley, a, major, farming, and, ranching, region, where, it, meets, one, of, its, largest, tributaries, the, gunnison, river, at, grand, junction, most, of, the, upper, river, is, a, swift, whitewater, stream, ranging, from, 200, to, 500, feet, 60, to, 150, m, wide, the, depth, ranging, from, 6, to, 30, feet, 2, to, 9, m, with, a, few, notable, exceptions, such, as, the, blackrocks, reach, where, the, river, is, nearly, 100, feet, 30, m, deep, in, a, few, areas, such, as, the, marshy, kawuneeche, valley, near, the, headwaters, and, the, grand, valley, it, exhibits, braided, characteristics, from, grand, junction, the, colorado, turns, northwest, before, cutting, southwest, across, the, eponymous, colorado, plateau, a, vast, area, of, high, desert, centered, at, the, four, corners, of, the, southwestern, united, states, here, the, climate, becomes, significantly, drier, than, that, in, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, river, becomes, entrenched, in, progressively, deeper, gorges, of, bare, rock, beginning, with, ruby, canyon, and, then, westwater, canyon, as, it, enters, utah, now, once, again, heading, southwest, farther, downstream, it, receives, the, dolores, river, and, defines, the, southern, border, of, arches, national, park, before, passing, moab, and, flowing, through, the, portal, where, it, exits, the, moab, valley, between, a, pair, of, 1, 000, foot, 300, m, sandstone, cliffs, in, utah, the, colorado, flows, primarily, through, the, slickrock, country, which, is, characterized, by, its, narrow, canyons, and, unique, folds, created, by, the, tilting, of, sedimentary, rock, layers, along, faults, this, is, one, of, the, most, inaccessible, regions, of, the, continental, united, states, below, the, confluence, with, the, green, river, its, largest, tributary, in, canyonlands, national, park, the, colorado, enters, cataract, canyon, named, for, its, dangerous, rapids, and, then, glen, canyon, known, for, its, arches, and, erosion, sculpted, navajo, sandstone, formations, here, the, san, juan, river, carrying, runoff, from, the, southern, slope, of, colorado, s, san, juan, mountains, joins, the, colorado, from, the, east, the, colorado, then, enters, northern, arizona, where, since, the, 1960s, glen, canyon, dam, near, page, has, flooded, the, glen, canyon, reach, of, the, river, forming, lake, powell, for, hydroelectricity, generation, in, arizona, the, river, passes, lee, s, ferry, an, important, crossing, for, early, explorers, and, settlers, and, since, the, early, 20th, century, the, principal, point, where, colorado, river, flows, are, measured, for, apportionment, to, the, seven, u, s, and, two, mexican, states, in, the, basin, downstream, the, river, enters, marble, canyon, the, beginning, of, the, grand, canyon, passing, under, the, navajo, bridges, on, a, now, southward, course, below, the, confluence, with, the, little, colorado, river, the, river, swings, west, into, granite, gorge, the, most, dramatic, portion, of, the, grand, canyon, where, the, river, cuts, up, to, one, mile, 1, 6, km, into, the, colorado, plateau, exposing, some, of, the, oldest, visible, rocks, on, earth, dating, as, long, ago, as, 2, billion, years, the, 277, miles, 446, km, of, the, river, that, flow, through, the, grand, canyon, are, largely, encompassed, by, grand, canyon, national, park, and, are, known, for, their, difficult, whitewater, separated, by, pools, that, reach, up, to, 110, feet, 34, m, in, depth, at, the, lower, end, of, grand, canyon, the, colorado, widens, into, lake, mead, the, largest, reservoir, in, the, continental, united, states, formed, by, hoover, dam, on, the, border, of, arizona, and, nevada, situated, southeast, of, metropolitan, las, vegas, the, dam, is, an, integral, component, for, management, of, the, colorado, river, controlling, floods, and, storing, water, for, farms, and, cities, in, the, lower, colorado, river, basin, below, the, dam, the, river, passes, under, the, mike, o, callaghan, pat, tillman, memorial, bridge, which, at, nearly, 900, feet, 270, m, above, the, water, is, the, highest, concrete, arch, bridge, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, then, turns, due, south, towards, mexico, defining, the, arizona, nevada, and, arizona, california, borders, after, leaving, the, confines, of, the, black, canyon, the, river, emerges, from, the, colorado, plateau, into, the, lower, colorado, river, valley, lcrv, a, desert, region, dependent, on, irrigation, agriculture, and, tourism, and, also, home, to, several, major, indian, reservations, the, river, widens, here, to, a, broad, moderately, deep, waterway, averaging, 500, to, 1, 000, feet, 150, to, 300, m, wide, and, reaching, up, to, 0, 25, miles, 400, m, across, with, depths, ranging, from, 8, to, 60, feet, 2, to, 20, m, before, channelization, of, the, colorado, in, the, 20th, century, the, lower, river, was, subject, to, frequent, course, changes, caused, by, seasonal, flow, variations, joseph, c, ives, who, surveyed, the, lower, river, in, 1861, wrote, that, the, shifting, of, the, channel, the, banks, the, islands, the, bars, is, so, continual, and, rapid, that, a, detailed, description, derived, from, the, experiences, of, one, trip, would, be, found, incorrect, not, only, during, the, subsequent, year, but, perhaps, in, the, course, of, a, week, or, even, a, day, the, lcrv, is, one, of, the, most, densely, populated, areas, along, the, river, and, there, are, numerous, towns, including, bullhead, city, arizona, needles, california, and, lake, havasu, city, arizona, here, several, large, diversions, draw, from, the, river, providing, water, for, both, local, uses, and, distant, regions, including, the, salt, river, valley, of, arizona, and, metropolitan, southern, california, the, last, major, u, s, diversion, is, at, imperial, dam, where, over, 90, percent, of, the, river, s, flow, is, moved, into, the, gila, gravity, canal, and, yuma, area, project, and, the, much, bigger, all, american, canal, to, irrigate, california, s, imperial, valley, the, most, productive, winter, agricultural, region, in, the, united, states, below, imperial, dam, only, a, small, portion, of, the, colorado, river, makes, it, beyond, yuma, arizona, and, the, confluence, with, the, intermittent, gila, river, which, carries, runoff, from, western, new, mexico, and, most, of, arizona, before, defining, 24, miles, 39, km, of, the, mexico, united, states, border, at, morelos, dam, the, entire, remaining, flow, of, the, colorado, is, diverted, to, irrigate, the, mexicali, valley, among, mexico, s, most, fertile, agricultural, lands, below, san, luis, r, o, colorado, the, colorado, passes, entirely, into, mexico, defining, the, baja, california, sonora, border, since, 1960, the, stretch, of, the, colorado, between, here, and, the, gulf, of, california, has, been, dry, or, a, trickle, formed, by, irrigation, return, flows, the, hardy, river, provides, most, of, the, flow, into, the, colorado, river, delta, a, vast, alluvial, floodplain, covering, about, 3, 000, square, miles, 7, 800, km, 2, of, northwestern, mexico, a, large, estuary, is, formed, here, before, the, colorado, empties, into, the, gulf, about, 75, miles, 120, km, south, of, yuma, occasionally, the, international, boundary, and, water, commission, allows, a, springtime, pulse, flow, to, recharge, the, delta, before, 20th, century, development, dewatered, the, lower, colorado, a, major, tidal, bore, was, present, in, the, delta, and, estuary, the, first, historical, record, was, made, by, the, croatian, missionary, in, spanish, service, father, ferdinand, kon, ak, on, july, 18, 1746, during, spring, tide, conditions, the, tidal, bore, locally, called, el, burro, formed, in, the, estuary, about, montague, island, in, baja, california, and, propagated, upstream, the, colorado, is, joined, by, over, 25, significant, tributaries, of, which, the, green, river, is, the, largest, by, both, length, and, discharge, the, green, river, takes, drainage, from, the, wind, river, range, of, west, central, wyoming, from, utah, s, uinta, mountains, and, from, the, rockies, of, northwestern, colorado, the, gila, river, is, the, second, longest, and, drains, a, greater, area, than, the, green, but, has, a, significantly, lower, flow, because, of, a, more, arid, climate, and, larger, diversions, for, irrigation, and, cities, both, the, gunnison, and, san, juan, rivers, which, derive, most, of, their, water, from, rocky, mountains, snowmelt, contribute, more, water, than, the, gila, contributed, naturally, the, colorado, river, basin, consists, of, 246, 000, square, miles, 640, 000, km, 2, making, it, the, seventh, largest, drainage, basin, in, north, america, about, 238, 600, square, miles, 618, 000, km, 2, or, 97, percent, of, the, basin, is, in, the, united, states, the, basin, extends, into, western, colorado, and, new, mexico, southwestern, wyoming, eastern, and, southern, utah, southeastern, nevada, and, california, and, most, of, arizona, the, areas, drained, within, baja, california, and, sonora, in, mexico, are, very, small, and, do, not, contribute, significant, runoff, aside, from, the, colorado, river, delta, the, basin, extends, into, sonora, at, a, few, locations, further, east, including, the, headwaters, of, the, santa, cruz, river, and, san, pedro, river, both, tributaries, of, the, gila, river, for, hydrological, management, purposes, the, colorado, river, basin, is, divided, into, the, upper, basin, the, drainage, area, above, lees, ferry, and, the, lower, basin, the, upper, basin, covers, only, 45, percent, of, the, land, area, of, the, colorado, river, basin, but, contributes, 92, percent, of, the, runoff, the, entire, eastern, boundary, of, the, colorado, river, basin, runs, along, the, north, american, continental, divide, and, is, defined, largely, by, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, rio, grande, basin, the, wind, river, range, in, wyoming, marks, the, northern, extent, of, the, basin, and, is, separated, from, the, colorado, rockies, by, the, endorheic, great, divide, basin, in, southwestern, wyoming, streams, that, are, nearby, the, east, side, of, the, divide, drain, into, the, mississippi, river, and, rio, grande, while, nearby, areas, north, of, the, wind, river, range, drain, into, the, columbia, river, the, western, boundary, of, the, colorado, river, basin, is, formed, by, various, ranges, and, plateaus, that, border, the, great, basin, including, the, uinta, mountains, and, wasatch, range, major, great, basin, watersheds, bordering, the, colorado, river, basin, are, the, great, salt, lake, and, sevier, lake, watersheds, to, the, south, the, colorado, river, basin, borders, several, watersheds, in, mexico, draining, into, the, gulf, of, california, including, the, sonoyta, concepci, n, and, yaqui, rivers, much, of, the, basin, is, at, high, elevation, the, mean, elevation, is, 5, 500, feet, 1, 700, m, lees, ferry, more, than, halfway, along, the, colorado, river, from, its, source, is, 3, 150, feet, 960, m, above, sea, level, the, highest, point, in, the, colorado, river, basin, is, 14, 321, foot, 4, 365, m, uncompahgre, peak, in, colorado, s, san, juan, mountains, while, some, water, from, the, river, drains, via, irrigation, run, off, into, california, s, salton, sea, 236, feet, 72, m, below, sea, level, about, 72, percent, of, the, colorado, river, basin, is, classified, as, arid, with, the, sonoran, and, mojave, deserts, covering, the, southern, portion, and, the, colorado, plateau, encompassing, much, of, the, central, portion, the, colorado, plateau, is, home, to, most, of, the, major, canyon, systems, formed, by, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, particularly, those, of, the, green, and, san, juan, rivers, about, 23, percent, of, the, basin, is, forest, with, the, largest, area, in, the, rocky, mountains, other, significant, forested, areas, include, the, kaibab, aquarius, and, markagunt, plateaus, in, southern, utah, and, northern, arizona, and, the, mogollon, rim, in, central, arizona, these, high, plateaus, and, escarpments, often, exceeding, 9, 000, feet, 2, 700, m, in, elevation, form, the, northern, and, southern, edges, of, the, colorado, plateau, geological, province, developed, land, use, in, the, basin, is, mostly, irrigated, agriculture, chiefly, in, the, grand, valley, the, lower, colorado, river, valley, and, the, salt, river, valley, but, the, total, area, of, crop, and, pasture, land, is, only, 2, 3, percent, of, the, entire, basin, urban, areas, cover, less, than, 1, percent, climate, in, the, colorado, river, basin, ranges, from, subtropical, hot, desert, at, southern, lower, elevations, to, alpine, in, the, rocky, mountains, mean, monthly, high, temperatures, are, 25, 3, c, 77, 5, f, in, the, upper, basin, and, 33, 4, c, 92, 1, f, in, the, lower, basin, and, lows, average, 3, 6, and, 8, 9, c, 25, 5, and, 48, 0, f, respectively, annual, precipitation, averages, 6, 5, inches, 164, mm, ranging, from, over, 60, inches, 1, 500, mm, in, some, areas, of, the, rockies, to, less, than, 4, inches, 100, mm, in, dry, desert, valleys, the, upper, basin, generally, receives, snow, and, rain, during, the, winter, and, early, spring, while, precipitation, in, the, lower, basin, falls, mainly, during, intense, but, infrequent, summer, thunderstorms, brought, on, by, the, north, american, monsoon, precipitation, is, influenced, by, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, with, el, ni, o, being, associated, with, wetter, conditions, and, la, ni, a, with, drier, conditions, the, effect, of, enso, is, significantly, more, pronounced, in, the, lower, basin, where, it, has, a, strong, impact, on, monsoonal, rainfall, runoff, patterns, across, the, colorado, river, basin, reflect, this, most, of, the, perennial, tributaries, originate, in, the, upper, basin, while, tributaries, in, the, lower, basin, are, either, ephemeral, such, as, the, little, colorado, river, or, highly, seasonal, such, as, the, gila, and, salt, rivers, as, of, 2010, approximately, 13, million, people, lived, within, the, colorado, river, basin, while, about, 40, million, people, live, in, areas, supplied, by, colorado, river, water, colorado, river, basin, states, are, among, the, fastest, growing, in, the, us, the, population, of, nevada, alone, increased, by, about, 66, percent, between, 1990, and, 2000, as, arizona, grew, by, some, 40, percent, phoenix, arizona, las, vegas, nevada, and, mexicali, baja, california, are, the, largest, cities, by, population, within, the, colorado, river, basin, other, significant, cities, include, tucson, arizona, st, george, utah, and, flagstaff, arizona, due, to, the, rugged, and, inhospitable, topography, through, which, the, river, flows, there, are, only, a, few, major, towns, along, the, colorado, river, itself, including, grand, junction, colorado, and, yuma, arizona, the, unimpaired, annual, runoff, of, the, colorado, river, at, lees, ferry, arizona, is, estimated, at, 14, 7, million, acre, feet, 18, 1, km, 3, or, an, annualized, discharge, of, 20, 300, cu, ft, s, 570, m, 3, s, for, the, 1906, 2023, period, river, flows, at, the, lees, ferry, stream, gauge, about, halfway, along, the, length, of, the, colorado, and, 16, miles, 26, km, below, glen, canyon, dam, are, used, to, determine, water, allocations, in, the, colorado, river, basin, flows, originating, above, lees, ferry, represent, the, majority, of, colorado, river, runoff, tributaries, between, there, and, imperial, dam, near, the, us, mexico, border, contribute, a, further, 1, 1, million, acre, feet, 1, 4, km, 3, and, the, gila, salt, river, system, historically, accounted, for, another, 1, 7, million, acre, feet, 2, 1, km, 3, while, much, of, this, water, was, lost, to, evaporation, in, the, deserts, of, the, lower, basin, anywhere, from, 10, to, 20, million, acre, feet, 12, to, 25, km, 3, per, year, reached, the, colorado, river, delta, prior, to, the, early, 20th, century, up, to, 90, percent, of, the, river, s, flow, originates, as, snowmelt, from, the, rocky, mountains, and, other, smaller, mountain, ranges, of, the, colorado, plateau, natural, seasonal, flows, at, its, mouth, varied, widely, often, exceeding, 100, 000, cu, ft, s, 2, 800, m, 3, s, in, the, spring, melt, and, falling, as, low, as, 2, 500, cu, ft, s, 71, m, 3, s, in, winter, snowmelt, typically, begins, in, april, peaks, in, may, or, june, and, can, extend, into, august, in, wet, years, monsoon, rainstorms, often, occur, in, the, lower, basin, from, august, through, october, contributing, much, of, the, flow, in, tributaries, below, lees, ferry, and, often, causing, flash, flooding, since, the, initial, closure, of, hoover, dam, in, 1934, lower, colorado, river, flows, have, been, greatly, moderated, with, monthly, means, below, the, dam, ranging, from, 16, 400, cu, ft, s, 460, m, 3, s, in, may, to, 11, 200, cu, ft, s, 320, m, 3, s, in, october, upstream, of, the, massive, hoover, and, glen, canyon, dams, inflows, to, lake, powell, still, experience, distinct, spring, highs, and, winter, lows, though, overall, volumes, have, been, reduced, due, to, upper, basin, water, diversions, flow, regimes, in, a, few, upper, basin, tributaries, such, as, the, yampa, river, remain, almost, completely, unaltered, by, the, 1950s, the, colorado, delta, was, regularly, drying, up, in, fall, and, winter, though, spring, high, flows, often, still, made, it, to, the, ocean, after, the, initial, closure, of, glen, canyon, dam, in, 1963, these, seasonal, flows, were, almost, completely, eliminated, with, the, exception, of, a, few, very, wet, years, such, as, 1983, 1987, in, 1984, 16, 5, million, acre, feet, 20, 4, km, 3, of, excess, runoff, reached, the, ocean, flows, have, further, declined, due, to, evaporation, from, reservoirs, and, particularly, after, 2000, reduced, snowpack, with, warming, winter, temperatures, in, the, rockies, water, diversions, have, effectively, removed, some, tributaries, entirely, including, the, gila, river, once, the, colorado, s, largest, tributary, below, lees, ferry, most, colorado, river, water, is, diverted, in, the, united, states, with, only, about, 2, 8, million, acre, feet, 3, 5, km, 3, per, year, reaching, mexico, since, 1950, at, morelos, dam, the, remaining, flow, is, diverted, to, irrigate, the, mexicali, valley, leaving, the, colorado, river, delta, almost, entirely, dry, except, for, small, amounts, of, agricultural, wastewater, as, recently, as, the, cretaceous, period, about, 100, million, years, ago, much, of, western, north, america, was, still, part, of, the, pacific, ocean, tectonic, forces, from, the, collision, of, the, farallon, plate, with, the, north, american, plate, pushed, up, the, rocky, mountains, between, 50, and, 75, million, years, ago, in, a, mountain, building, episode, known, as, the, laramide, orogeny, the, colorado, river, first, formed, as, a, west, flowing, stream, draining, the, southwestern, portion, of, the, range, and, the, uplift, also, diverted, the, green, river, once, a, tributary, of, the, mississippi, river, west, towards, the, colorado, about, 30, to, 20, million, years, ago, volcanic, activity, related, to, the, orogeny, led, to, the, mid, tertiary, ignimbrite, flare, up, which, created, smaller, formations, such, as, the, chiricahua, mountains, in, arizona, and, deposited, massive, amounts, of, volcanic, ash, and, debris, over, the, watershed, the, colorado, plateau, first, began, to, rise, during, the,

present, course, into, the, gulf, of, california, the, time, scale, and, sequence, over, which, the, river, s, present, course, and, the, grand, canyon, were, formed, is, uncertain, before, the, gulf, of, california, was, formed, around, 12, to, 5, million, years, ago, by, faulting, processes, along, the, boundary, of, the, north, american, and, pacific, plates, the, colorado, flowed, west, to, an, outlet, on, the, pacific, ocean, possibly, monterey, bay, on, the, central, california, coast, and, may, have, played, a, role, in, the, formation, of, the, monterey, submarine, canyon, crustal, extension, in, the, basin, and, range, province, began, about, 20, million, years, ago, and, the, modern, sierra, nevada, began, forming, about, 10, million, years, ago, eventually, diverting, the, colorado, southwards, towards, the, gulf, as, the, colorado, plateau, continued, to, rise, between, 5, and, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, river, maintained, its, ancestral, course, as, an, antecedent, stream, and, began, to, cut, the, grand, canyon, antecedence, played, a, major, part, in, shaping, other, peculiar, geographic, features, in, the, watershed, including, the, dolores, river, s, bisection, of, paradox, valley, in, colorado, and, the, green, river, s, cut, through, the, uinta, mountains, in, utah, sediments, carried, from, the, plateau, by, the, colorado, river, created, a, vast, delta, made, of, more, than, 10, 000, cubic, miles, 42, 000, km, 3, of, material, that, walled, off, the, northernmost, part, of, the, gulf, in, approximately, 1, million, years, cut, off, from, the, ocean, the, portion, of, the, gulf, north, of, the, delta, eventually, evaporated, and, formed, the, salton, sink, which, reached, about, 260, feet, 79, m, below, sea, level, since, then, the, river, has, changed, course, into, the, salton, sink, at, least, three, times, transforming, it, into, lake, cahuilla, which, at, maximum, size, flooded, up, the, valley, to, present, day, indio, california, the, lake, took, about, 50, years, to, evaporate, after, the, colorado, resumed, flowing, to, the, gulf, the, present, day, salton, sea, can, be, considered, the, most, recent, incarnation, of, lake, cahuilla, though, on, a, much, smaller, scale, between, 1, 8, million, and, 10, 000, years, ago, massive, flows, of, basalt, from, the, uinkaret, volcanic, field, in, northern, arizona, dammed, the, colorado, river, within, the, grand, canyon, at, least, 13, lava, dams, were, formed, the, largest, of, which, was, more, than, 2, 300, feet, 700, m, high, backing,

accumulated, in, the, impounded, lakes, over, time, suggests, that, most, of, these, dams, did, not, survive, for, more, than, a, few, decades, before, collapsing, or, being, washed, away, failure, of, the, lava, dams, caused, by, erosion, leaks, and, cavitation, caused, catastrophic, floods, which, may, have, been, some, of, the, largest, ever, to, occur, in, north, america, rivaling, the,

with, no, gold, to, be, found, in, the, same, year, melchior, d, az, explored, the, colorado, river, s, delta, and, named, it, rio, del, tizon, fire, brand, river, after, seeing, a, practice, used, by, the, local, people, for, warming, themselves, by, the, late, 1500s, or, early, 1600s, the, utes, had, acquired, horses, from, the, spanish, and, their, use, for, hunting, trade, and, warfare, soon, became, widespread, among, utes, and, navajo, in, the, colorado, river, basin, this, conferred, them, a, military, advantage, over, goshutes, and, southern, paiutes, that, were, slower, to, adopt, horses, the, navajo, also, adopted, a, culture, of, livestock, herding, as, they, acquired, sheep, and, goats, from, the, spanish, juan, bautista, de, anza, in, 1774, was, the, first, spaniard, to, reach, yuma, crossing, where, he, established, friendly, relations, with, the, quechan, people, and, opened, the, anza, trail, between, arizona, and, the, california, coast, the, spanish, soon, founded, mission, puerto, de, purisima, concepcion, and, mission, san, pedro, y, san, pablo, de, bicuner, along, the, lower, colorado, river, however, spanish, attempts, to, control, the, crossing, led, to, the, 1781, yuma, revolt, in, which, over, 100, soldiers, and, colonists, were, killed, and, the, settlements, were, abandoned, the, quechan, blocked, foreigners, use, of, the, crossing, until, the, arrival, of, american, mountain, men, and, fur, trappers, in, the, 1820s, the, name, rio, colorado, first, appears, in, 1701, on, the, map, paso, por, tierra, a, la, california, published, by, missionary, eusebio, kino, who, also, determined, during, that, time, that, baja, california, was, a, peninsula, not, an, island, as, previously, believed, in, the, 1700s, and, early, 1800s, many, spanish, and, american, explorers, believed, in, the, existence, of, a, buenaventura, river, that, ran, from, the, rocky, mountains, to, the, pacific, coast, in, 1776, silvestre, v, lez, de, escalante, attached, this, name, to, the, upper, green, river, and, a, number, of, later, maps, showed, this, connecting, to, lake, timpanogos, now, utah, lake, and, flowing, west, to, california, the, dominguez, escalante, expedition, first, reached, the, colorado, river, near, the, junction, with, the, dolores, river, naming, the, larger, river, rio, san, rafael, they, later, forded, the, colorado, in, southeastern, utah, at, crossing, of, the, fathers, now, submerged, in, lake, powell, in, the, 1820s, american, fur, trappers, along, the, upper, green, river, in, wyoming, known, to, them, as, the, seedskeedee, or, variants, thereof, seeking, a, route, to, export, furs, to, the, coast, surmised, that, this, and, what, the, spanish, called, the, colorado, were, in, fact, connected, william, h, ashley, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, navigate, from, the, green, river, to, the, colorado, s, mouth, in, 1825, in, 1826, jedediah, smith, arrived, at, the, lower, colorado, river, referring, to, it, as, the, seedskeedee, and, proceeded, upstream, exploring, as, far, as, black, canyon, during, the, 1830s, various, fur, trappers, from, wyoming, made, it, as, far, downstream, as, cataract, canyon, and, glen, canyon, but, none, were, able, to, navigate, the, full, length, of, the, river, in, 1843, john, c, fr, mont, explored, the, great, basin, and, conclusively, determined, no, buenaventura, river, flowed, west, to, california, thus, the, direction, of, river, flow, must, be, southwest, by, the, early, 19th, century, the, stretch, of, the, colorado, above, the, confluence, of, the, green, river, at, cataract, canyon, utah, became, known, to, fur, trappers, as, the, grand, river, though, the, exact, origin, of, this, name, is, unknown, the, grand, river, above, the, confluence, with, the, gunnison, river, was, also, called, the, bunkara, river, the, blue, river, or, the, north, fork, of, the, grand, river, until, the, 1870s, by, the, early, 1900s, the, name, grand, river, had, been, attached, to, the, entire, stream, as, far, as, grand, lake, which, was, then, considered, its, official, source, although, the, grand, river, was, renamed, the, colorado, in, 1921, its, name, survives, in, numerous, places, such, as, grand, county, and, grand, junction, colorado, in, 1848, the, u, s, army, established, fort, yuma, creating, the, first, permanent, u, s, settlement, along, the, river, this, served, as, a, military, garrison, and, supply, point, for, settlers, headed, to, california, along, the, southern, emigrant, trail, due, to, the, arduous, task, of, ferrying, supplies, overland, the, schooner, invincible, attempted, to, bring, supplies, up, the, river, but, was, thwarted, by, the, delta, s, strong, tides, steamboats, were, brought, to, the, river, starting, in, 1852, with, the, sidewheeler, uncle, sam, whose, first, voyage, from, the, gulf, to, yuma, took, fifteen, days, 15, exploration, by, steamboat, soon, advanced, upriver, in, 1857, george, a, johnson, in, the, general, jesup, was, able, to, reach, pyramid, canyon, over, 300, miles, 480, km, north, of, fort, yuma, 16, 17, 19, he, was, followed, by, lt, joseph, christmas, ives, who, used, a, specially, built, shallow, draft, steamboat, explorer, to, reach, black, canyon, where, hoover, dam, stands, today, part, 1, 85, 87, having, set, out, to, determine, the, river, s, suitability, as, a, navigation, route, ives, remarked, ours, has, been, the, first, and, will, doubtless, be, the, last, party, of, whites, to, visit, this, profitless, locality, it, seems, intended, by, nature, that, the, colorado, river, along, the, greater, portion, of, its, lonely, and, majestic, way, shall, be, forever, unvisited, and, undisturbed, the, last, part, of, the, colorado, river, to, be, surveyed, was, the, grand, canyon, itself, in, 1869, john, wesley, powell, with, nine, men, set, out, on, an, expedition, from, green, river, station, wyoming, they, were, the, first, part, of, non, natives, to, travel, the, length, of, the, grand, canyon, and, the, first, to, successfully, travel, by, boat, from, the, upper, green, river, to, the, lower, colorado, powell, led, a, second, expedition, in, 1871, with, financial, backing, from, the, u, s, government, and, continued, to, conduct, geographical, and, botanical, surveys, across, the, region, until, the, 1890s, another, grand, canyon, river, expedition, was, led, in, 1889, 1890, by, robert, brewster, stanton, to, survey, a, route, for, a, proposed, railroad, through, the, canyon, which, was,

colorado, river, reservations, chemehuevi, and, later, some, hopi, and, navajo, peoples, were, also, moved, to, the, colorado, river, reservation, where, they, today, form, the, colorado, river, indian, tribes, as, the, american, frontier, expanded, into, the, colorado, plateau, an, effort, to, expel, the, navajo, from, the, four, corners, region, was, begun, by, general, james, henry, carleton, who, in, 1864, enlisted, mountain, man, kit, carson, to, lead, a, campaign, against, the, navajo, carson, with, the, help, of, the, navajo, s, ute, enemies, captured, more, than, 8, 000, navajo, and, forcibly, marched, them, to, fort, sumner, new, mexico, hundreds, died, during, what, is, now, known, as, the, long, walk, and, while, enduring, appalling, conditions, at, fort, sumner, after, the, failure, of, the, army, to, maintain, the, reservation, there, the, treaty, of, bosque, redondo, established, the, navajo, nation, in, the, four, corners, where, the, navajo, were, allowed, to, return, in, 1868, gold, and, silver, were, also, discovered, in, the, upper, basin, beginning, with, the, 1859, blue, river, strike, that, led, to, the, founding, of, breckenridge, colorado, up, until, the, 1860s, southwestern, colorado, had, remained, relatively, untouched, by, u, s, westward, expansion, as, the, americans, had, recognized, ute, sovereignty, by, treaty, following, the, 1861, carving, out, of, colorado, territory, and, further, mineral, strikes, including, ouray, and, telluride, ute, leaders, were, coerced, into, signing, the, 1873, brunot, agreement, in, which, they, lost, rights, to, most, of, their, land, a, flood, of, mineral, prospecting, and, settlement, ensued, in, western, colorado, by, 1881, the, army, had, driven, out, the, remaining, pockets, of, ute, resistance, on, the, western, slope, officially, opening, the, grand, river, country, to, settlement, and, the, town, of, grand, junction, was, incorporated, a, year, later, the,

the, green, river, was, longer, and, drained, a, larger, area, taylor, argued, that, the, grand, river, should, be, considered, the, main, stream, as, it, carried, the, larger, volume, of, water, taylor, felt, slighted, that, the, colorado, river, as, named, did, not, begin, in, the, state, of, colorado, and, he, wasn, t, going, to, let, utah, or, wyoming, lay, claim, to, the, river, s,

that, each, drop, of, its, water, is, used, an, average, of, 17, times, in, a, single, year, southern, nevada, water, authority, has, called, the, colorado, river, one, of, the, most, controlled, controversial, and, litigated, rivers, in, the, world, in, 1922, six, u, s, states, signed, the, colorado, river, compact, which, divided, half, of, the, river, s, flow, to, both, the, upper, basin, the, drainage, area, above, lee, s, ferry, comprising, parts, of, colorado, new, mexico, utah, and, wyoming, and, a, small, portion, of, arizona, and, the, lower, basin, arizona, california, nevada, and, parts, of, new, mexico, and, utah, the, upper, and, lower, basin, were, each, allocated, 7, 5, million, acre, feet, 9, 3, km, 3, of, water, per, year, a, figure, believed, to, represent, half, of, the, river, s, annual, flow, at, lee, s, ferry, the, allotments, operated, under, the, premise, that, approximately, 17, 5, million, acre, feet, of, water, flowed, through, the, river, annually, arizona, initially, refused, to, ratify, the, compact, because, it, feared, that, california, would, take, too, much, of, the, lower, basin, allotment, in, 1944, a, compromise, was, reached, in, which, arizona, was, allocated, 2, 8, million, acre, feet, 3, 5, km, 3, but, with, the, caveat, that, california, s, 4, 4, million, acre, foot, 5, 4, km, 3, allocation, was, prioritized, during, drought, years, these, and, nine, other, decisions, compacts, federal, acts, and, agreements, made, between, 1922, and, 1973, constitute, what, is, now, known, as, the, law, of, the, river, in, 1944, a, treaty, between, the, u, s, and, mexico, allocated, 1, 5, million, acre, feet, 1, 9, km, 3, of, colorado, river, water, to, mexico, each, year, morelos, dam, was, constructed, in, 1950, to, enable, mexico, to, utilize, its, share, of, the, river, water, allocated, to, mexico, from, the, colorado, river, is, regulated, by, the, international, boundary, and, water, commission, which, also, apportions, waters, from, the, rio, grande, between, the, two, countries, large, scale, development, of, colorado, river, water, supplies, started, in, the, late, 19th, century, at, the, river, s, headwaters, in, la, poudre, pass, the, grand, ditch, directing, runoff, from, the, river, s, headwaters, across, the, continental, divide, to, arid, eastern, colorado, was, considered, an, engineering, marvel, when, completed, in, 1890, this, was, the, first, of, twenty, four, transmountain, diversions, constructed, to, draw, water, across, the, rocky, mountains, as, the, front, range, corridor, increased, in, population, these, diversions, draw, water, from, the, upper, colorado, and, its, tributaries, into, the, south, platte, river, arkansas, river, and, rio, grande, basins, today, about, 80, percent, of, colorado, s, population, lives, on, the, eastern, slope, of, the, rockies, while, 80, percent, of, precipitation, falls, on, the, western, slope, while, first, planned, at, the, same, time, as, the, grand, ditch, construction, on, the, colorado, big, thompson, project, c, bt, did, not, begin, until, the, 1930s, today, the, c, bt, is, the, largest, of, the, transmountain, diversions, delivering, 230, 000, acre, feet, 280, 000, 000, m, 3, per, year, from, the, colorado, river, to, cities, north, of, denver, numerous, other, projects, followed, with, the, largest, including, the, roberts, tunnel, which, delivers, water, from, the, blue, river, to, the, city, of, denver, and, the, fryingpan, arkansas, project, which, diverts, water, from, the, fryingpan, river, to, the, arkansas, river, basin, combined, the, transmountain, diversions, draw, about, 580, 000, acre, feet, 720, 000, 000, m, 3, of, water, per, year, out, of, the, colorado, river, basin, historically, most, of, the, water, has, been, used, for, irrigation, although, water, usage, is, increasing, for, urban, water, supply, and, for, recreational, purposes, such, as, snowmaking, and, increasing, eastern, slope, streamflows, for, boating, and, fishing, denver, water, receives, about, 50, percent, of, its, supply, from, the, colorado, river, basin, however, diversions, have, caused, environmental, harm, to, the, upper, colorado, river, system, by, reducing, streamflows, in, many, tributaries, a, number, of, reservoirs, have, been, built, to, offset, the, impact, of, transmountain, diversions, by, storing, water, for, dry, season, release, on, the, western, slope, including, williams, fork, reservoir, in, 1959, and, wolford, mountain, reservoir, in, 1996, the, colorado, river, delta, region, in, mexico, became, a, favored, place, for, americans, to, invest, in, agriculture, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, mexican, president, porfirio, d, az, welcomed, foreign, capital, to, develop, the, country, the, colorado, river, land, company, formed, by, los, angeles, times, publisher, harry, chandler, his, father, in, law, harrison, gray, otis, and, others, developed, the, mexicali, valley, in, baja, california, as, a, thriving, land, company, the, company, headquarters, was, nominally, based, in, mexico, but, its, real, headquarters, was, in, los, angeles, california, land, was, leased, mainly, to, americans, who, were, required, to, develop, it, colorado, river, water, was, used, to, irrigate, the, rich, soil, the, company, largely, escaped, the, turmoil, of, the, mexican, revolution, 1910, 20, but, in, the, postrevolutionary, period, the, mexican, government, expropriated, the, company, s, land, to, satisfy, the, demand, for, land, reform, in, 1900, the, california, development, company, cdc, envisioned, irrigating, the, imperial, valley, a, then, dry, basin, on, the, california, mexico, border, using, water, from, the, colorado, river, due, to, the, valley, s, location, below, sea, level, water, could, be, diverted, and, allowed, to, flow, there, entirely, by, gravity, engineer, george, chaffey, was, hired, to, design, the, alamo, canal, which, split, from, the, colorado, near, pilot, knob, california, and, ran, south, into, mexico, where, it, joined, the, alamo, river, a, dry, arroyo, which, had, historically, carried, overflowing, floodwaters, from, the, colorado, into, the, salton, sink, at, the, bottom, of, imperial, valley, the, scheme, worked, initially, by, 1903, about, four, thousand, people, lived, in, the, valley, and, more, than, 100, 000, acres, 40, 000, ha, of, farmland, had, been, developed, the, alamo, canal, experienced, continual, problems, due, to, the, colorado, s, high, sediment, content, and, its, varying, water, levels, during, low, flows, the, river, often, dropped, below, the, level, of, the, canal, intake, while, high, flows, silted, up, the, intake, forcing, the, repeated, excavation, of, new, cuts, in, early, 1905, flooding, destroyed, the, intake, gates, and, water, began, to, flow, uncontrolled, down, the, canal, towards, the, salton, sink, by, august, the, breach, had, grown, large, enough, to, swallow, the, entire, flow, of, the, river, which, began, to, flood, the, bottom, of, the, valley, the, southern, pacific, railroad, attempted, to, dam, the, flow, in, order, to, protect, their, tracks, which, ran, through, the, valley, but, was, hampered, by, repeated, flooding, it, took, seven, attempts, more, than, 3, million, and, two, years, for, the, railroad, the, cdc, and, the, federal, government, to, permanently, block, the, breach, and, restore, the, river, s, original, course, but, not, before, part, of, the, imperial, valley, was, flooded, under, a, 45, mile, long, 72, km, lake, today, s, salton, sea, the, imperial, valley, fiasco, demonstrated, that, further, economic, development, of, the, region, would, require, a, dam, to, control, the, colorado, s, unpredictable, flows, a, large, dam, on, the, colorado, river, had, been, envisioned, since, the, 1920s, in, 1928, congress, authorized, the, reclamation, service, today, s, u, s, bureau, of, reclamation, or, usbr, to, build, the, boulder, canyon, project, whose, key, feature, would, be, a, dam, on, the, colorado, in, black, canyon, 30, miles, 48, km, southeast, of, las, vegas, nevada, on, september, 30, 1935, hoover, dam, was, completed, forming, lake, mead, capable, of, holding, more, than, two, years, of, the, colorado, s, flow, lake, mead, was, and, still, is, the, largest, artificial, lake, in, the, u, s, by, storage, capacity, the, construction, of, hoover, dam, stabilized, the, lower, channel, of, the, colorado, river, stored, water, for, irrigation, in, times, of, drought, captured, sediment, and, controlled, floods, hoover, was, the, tallest, dam, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, construction, and, also, had, the, world, s, largest, hydroelectric, power, plant, the, boulder, canyon, project, act, also, authorized, the, all, american, canal, which, was, built, as, a, permanent, replacement, for, the, alamo, canal, and, follows, a, route, entirely, within, the, u, s, on, its, way, to, the, imperial, valley, the, canal, s, intake, is, located, at, imperial, dam, 20, miles, 32, km, above, yuma, arizona, which, diverts, the, majority, of, the, colorado, s, flow, with, only, a, small, portion, continuing, to, mexico, with, a, capacity, of, over, 26, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, 740, m, 3, s, the, all, american, canal, is, the, largest, irrigation, canal, in, the, world, because, the, hot, sunny, climate, lends, to, a, year, round, growing, season, the, imperial, valley, has, become, one, of, the, most, productive, farming, regions, in, north, america, providing, much, of, the, winter, produce, supply, in, the, u, s, the, imperial, irrigation, district, supplies, water, to, 520, 000, acres, 210, 000, ha, south, of, the, salton, sea, the, coachella, canal, which, branches, northward, from, the, all, american, canal, irrigates, another, 78, 000, acres, 32, 000, ha, in, the, coachella, valley, parker, dam, was, initially, built, as, the, diversion, point, for, the, colorado, river, aqueduct, planned, by, the, metropolitan, water, district, of, southern, california, to, supply, water, to, los, angeles, the, construction, of, the, dam, was, opposed, by, arizona, which, feared, that, california, would, take, too, much, water, from, the, colorado, at, one, point, arizona, sent, members, of, its, national, guard, to, stop, work, on, the, dam, ultimately, a, compromise, was, reached, with, arizona, dropping, its, objections, in, exchange, for, the, usbr, constructing, the, gila, project, which, irrigates, 110, 000, acres, 450, km, 2, on, the, arizona, side, of, the, river, by, 1941, the, 241, mile, 388, km, long, colorado, river, aqueduct, was, completed, delivering, 1, 2, million, acre, feet, 1, 5, km, 3, of, water, west, to, southern, california, the, aqueduct, enabled, the, continued, growth, of, los, angeles, and, its, suburbs, and, provides, water, to, about, 10, million, people, today, the, san, diego, aqueduct, which, branches, off, from, the, colorado, river, aqueduct, in, riverside, county, california, opened, in, stages, between, 1954, 1971, and, provides, water, to, another, 3, million, people, in, the, san, diego, metro, area, the, las, vegas, valley, of, nevada, experienced, rapid, growth, after, hoover, dam, and, by, 1937, las, vegas, had, tapped, a, pipeline, into, lake, mead, nevada, officials, believing, that, groundwater, resources, in, the, southern, part, of, the, state, were, sufficient, for, future, growth, were, more, concerned, with, securing, a, large, amount, of, the, dam, s, power, supply, than, water, from, the, colorado, thus, they, settled, for, the, smallest, water, allocation, of, all, the, states, in, the, colorado, river, compact, in, 2018, due, to, declining, water, levels, in, lake, mead, a, second, pipeline, was, completed, with, a, lower, intake, elevation, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, upper, basin, states, with, the, exception, of, colorado, had, developed, very, little, of, their, water, allocations, from, the, colorado, river, compact, by, the, 1950s, however, water, demand, was, rapidly, increasing, in, utah, s, wasatch, front, salt, lake, city, metro, area, and, the, rio, grande, valley, of, new, mexico, which, both, began, exploring, ways, to, divert, water, from, the, colorado, basin, the, upper, basin, states, were, concerned, that, they, would, not, be, able, to, use, their, full, compact, allocations, due, to, increasing, water, demands, in, the, lower, basin, the, compact, requires, the, upper, basin, to, deliver, a, minimum, annual, flow, of, 7, 5, million, acre, feet, 9, 3, 10, 9, m, 3, past, lee, s, ferry, measured, on, a, 10, year, rolling, average, without, additional, reservoir, storage, the, upper, basin, states, could, not, utilize, their, allocations, without, impacting, water, deliveries, to, the, lower, basin, in, dry, years, in, 1956, congress, authorized, the, usbr, to, construct, the, colorado, river, storage, project, crsp, which, planned, several, large, reservoirs, on, the, upper, colorado, green, gunnison, and, san, juan, rivers, the, initial, blueprints, for, the, crsp, included, two, dams, on, the, green, river, within, echo, park, canyon, in, dinosaur, national, monument, a, move, criticized, by, both, the, national, park, service, and, environmental, groups, such, as, the, sierra, club, the, controversy, received, nationwide, media, attention, and, the, usbr, dropped, its, plans, for, the, dinosaur, dams, in, exchange, for, increasing, the, size, of, a, proposed, dam, at, glen, canyon, the, controversy, associated, with, glen, canyon, dam, did, not, build, momentum, until, construction, was, well, underway, due, to, glen, canyon, s, remote, location, most, of, the, american, public, did, not, even, know, of, its, existence, the, few, who, did, contended, that, it, had, much, greater, scenic, value, than, echo, park, the, environmental, movement, in, the, american, southwest, has, opposed, the, damming, and, diversion, of, the, colorado, river, system, due, to, negative, effects, on, the, ecology, and, natural, beauty, of, the, river, and, its, tributaries, during, the, construction, of, glen, canyon, dam, 1956, 66, environmental, organizations, vowed, to, block, any, further, development, of, the, river, and, a, number, of, later, dam, and, aqueduct, proposals, were, defeated, by, citizen, opposition, sierra, club, leader, david, brower, fought, the, dam, both, during, the, construction, and, for, many, years, afterwards, until, his, death, in, 2000, brower, believed, that, he, was, personally, responsible, for, the, failure, to, prevent, glen, canyon, s, flooding, calling, it, his, greatest, mistake, greatest, sin, in, addition, to, glen, canyon, dam, the, crsp, includes, the, flaming, gorge, dam, on, the, green, river, the, blue, mesa, morrow, point, and, crystal, dams, on, the, gunnison, river, and, the, navajo, dam, on, the, san, juan, river, a, total, of, 22, participating, projects, of, which, 16, have, been, constructed, were, later, authorized, in, order, to, develop, local, water, supplies, at, various, locations, across, the, upper, basin, states, these, include, the, central, utah, project, which, delivers, 102, 000, acre, feet, 126, 000, 000, m, 3, per, year, from, the, green, river, basin, to, the, wasatch, front, and, the, san, juan, chama, project, which, diverts, 110, 000, acre, feet, 140, 000, 000, m, 3, per, year, from, the, san, juan, river, to, the, rio, grande, valley, both, are, multi, purpose, projects, serving, a, variety, of, agricultural, municipal, and, industrial, uses, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, planners, were, concerned, that, continued, growth, in, water, demand, would, outstrip, the, available, water, supply, from, the, colorado, river, after, exploring, a, multitude, of, potential, projects, the, usbr, published, a, study, in, january, 1964, known, as, the, pacific, southwest, water, plan, which, proposed, diverting, water, from, the, northwestern, united, states, into, the, colorado, river, basin, arizona, s, water, allocation, was, a, significant, focus, of, the, plan, due, to, the, growing, concern, that, its, water, supply, could, be, curtailed, due, to, california, s, seniority, of, water, rights, in, addition, the, plan, would, guarantee, full, water, supplies, to, nevada, california, and, mexico, allowing, the, upper, basin, states, to, utilize, their, full, allocations, without, risking, reductions, in, the, lower, basin, the, project, would, cost, an, estimated, 3, 1, billion, the, first, stage, of, this, plan, would, divert, water, from, northern, california, s, trinity, klamath, and, eel, rivers, to, southern, california, allowing, more, colorado, river, water, to, be, used, by, exchange, in, arizona, a, canal, system, which, ultimately, would, become, the, central, arizona, project, cap, would, be, constructed, to, deliver, arizona, s, colorado, river, allocation, to, phoenix, and, tucson, both, located, far, away, from, the, colorado, river, in, the, middle, of, the, state, at, this, point, central, arizona, was, still, entirely, dependent, on, local, water, supplies, such, as, the, 1911, theodore, roosevelt, dam, and, was, quickly, running, out, of, surplus, water, in, order, to, supply, the, massive, amount, of, power, required, to, pump, colorado, river, water, to, central, arizona, two, hydroelectric, dams, were, proposed, in, the, grand, canyon, bridge, canyon, dam, and, marble, canyon, dam, which, while, not, directly, located, in, grand, canyon, national, park, would, greatly, impact, flows, of, the, colorado, river, through, the, park, with, the, controversy, over, glen, canyon, dam, still, ongoing, the, public, pressure, against, these, dams, was, immense, as, a, result, the, two, grand, canyon, dams, were, omitted, from, the, final, cap, authorization, in, 1968, in, addition, the, boundaries, of, grand, canyon, national, park, were, redrawn, to, prevent, future, dam, projects, in, the, area, the, pumping, power, was, replaced, by, the, building, of, the, coal, fired, navajo, generating, station, near, page, arizona, in, 1976, in, 2019, the, navajo, generating, station, ceased, operation, the, cap, was, constructed, in, stages, from, 1973, to, 1993, ultimately, extending, 336, miles, 541, km, from, the, colorado, river, at, parker, dam, to, tucson, arizona, it, delivers, 1, 4, million, acre, feet, 1, 7, km, 3, of, water, per, year, irrigates, 830, 000, acres, 3, 400, km, 2, of, farmland, and, provides, municipal, water, to, about, 5, million, people, due, to, environmental, concerns, most, of, the, facilities, proposed, in, the, pacific, southwest, water, plan, were, never, built, though, a, smaller, version, of, the, trinity, river, project, was, constructed, as, part, of, the, unrelated, central, valley, project, leaving, arizona, and, nevada, vulnerable, to, future, water, reductions, under, the, compact, water, rights, of, native, americans, in, the, colorado, river, basin, were, largely, ignored, during, the, extensive, water, resources, development, carried, out, on, the, river, and, its, tributaries, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, construction, of, dams, has, often, had, negative, impacts, on, tribal, peoples, such, as, the, chemehuevi, when, their, riverside, lands, were, flooded, after, the, completion, of, parker, dam, in, 1938, ten, native, american, tribes, in, the, basin, now, hold, or, continue, to, claim, water, rights, to, the, colorado, river, the, u, s, government, has, taken, some, actions, to, help, quantify, and, develop, the, water, resources, of, native, american, reservations, the, first, federally, funded, irrigation, project, in, the, u, s, was, the, construction, of, an, irrigation, canal, on, the, colorado, river, indian, reservation, in, 1867, other, water, projects, include, the, navajo, indian, irrigation, project, authorized, in, 1962, for, the, irrigation, of, lands, in, part, of, the, navajo, nation, in, north, central, new, mexico, the, navajo, continue, to, seek, expansion, of, their, water, rights, because, of, difficulties, with, the, water, supply, on, their, reservation, about, 40, percent, of, its, inhabitants, must, haul, water, by, truck, many, miles, to, their, homes, in, the, 21st, century, they, have, filed, legal, claims, against, the, governments, of, arizona, new, mexico, and, utah, for, increased, water, rights, some, of, these, claims, have, been, successful, for, the, navajo, such, as, a, 2004, settlement, in, which, they, received, a, 326, 000, acre, foot, 402, 000, ml, allotment, from, new, mexico, a, deficit, river, as, if, the, river, were, somehow, at, fault, for, its, overuse, when, the, colorado, river, compact, was, drafted, in, the, 1920s, it, was, based, on, barely, 30, years, of, streamflow, records, that, suggested, an, average, annual, flow, of, 17, 5, million, acre, feet, 21, 6, km, 3, past, lee, s, ferry, modern, studies, of, tree, rings, revealed, that, those, three, decades, were, probably, the, wettest, in, the, past, 500, to, 1, 200, years, and, that, the, natural, long, term, annual, flow, past, lee, s, ferry, is, probably, closer, to, 13, 5, million, acre, feet, 16, 7, km, 3, with, a, natural, flow, at, the, mouth, around, 16, 3, million, acre, feet, 20, 1, km, 3, this, has, resulted, in, more, water, being, allocated, to, river, users, than, actually, exists, in, the, colorado, droughts, have, exacerbated, the, issue, of, water, over, allocation, the, most, severe, drought, on, record, the, southwestern, north, american, megadrought, began, in, the, early, 21st, century, in, which, the, river, basin, has, produced, above, average, runoff, in, only, five, years, between, 2000, and, 2021, the, region, is, experiencing, a, warming, trend, which, is, accompanied, by, earlier, snowmelt, lower, precipitation, and, greater, evapotranspiration, a, 2004, study, showed, that, a, 1, 6, percent, decrease, of, precipitation, would, lead, to, runoff, declining, by, as, much, as, 18, percent, by, 2050, since, 2000, reservoir, levels, have, fluctuated, greatly, from, year, to, year, but, have, experienced, a, steady, long, term, decline, the, particularly, dry, spell, between, 2000, and, 2004, brought, lake, powell, to, just, a, third, of, capacity, in, 2005, the, lowest, level, on, record, since, initial, filling, in, 1969, in, late, 2010, lake, mead, was, approaching, the, drought, trigger, elevation, of, 1, 075, feet, 328, m, at, which, water, supplies, to, arizona, and, nevada, would, be, reduced, in, accordance, with, the, colorado, river, compact, due, to, arizona, and, nevada, s, water, rights, being, junior, to, california, s, their, allocations, can, legally, be, cut, to, zero, before, any, reductions, are, made, on, the, california, side, a, wet, winter, in, 2011, temporarily, raised, lake, levels, but, dry, conditions, returned, in, the, next, two, years, in, 2014, the, bureau, of, reclamation, cut, releases, from, lake, powell, by, 10, percent, the, first, such, reduction, since, the, 1960s, when, lake, powell, was, being, filled, for, the, first, time, this, resulted, in, lake, mead, dropping, to, its, lowest, recorded, level, since, 1937, when, it, was, first, being, filled, water, year, 2018, had, a, much, lower, than, average, snowpack, in, july, 2021, after, two, more, extremely, dry, winters, lake, powell, fell, below, the, previous, low, set, in, 2005, in, response, the, bureau, of, reclamation, began, releasing, water, from, upstream, reservoirs, in, order, to, keep, powell, above, the, minimum, level, for, hydropower, generation, lake, mead, fell, below, the, 1, 075, foot, 328, m, level, expected, to, trigger, federally, mandated, cuts, to, arizona, and, nevada, s, water, supplies, for, the, first, time, in, history, and, is, expected, to, continue, declining, into, 2022, on, august, 16, 2021, the, bureau, of, reclamation, released, the, colorado, river, basin, august, 2021, 24, month, study, and, for, the, first, time, declared, a, shortage, and, that, because, of, ongoing, historic, drought, and, low, runoff, conditions, in, the, colorado, river, basin, downstream, releases, from, glen, canyon, dam, and, hoover, dam, will, be, reduced, in, 2022, due, to, declining, reservoir, levels, the, lower, basin, reductions, will, reduce, the, annual, apportionments, arizona, s, by, 18, percent, nevada, s, by, 7, percent, and, mexico, s, by, 5, percent, on, june, 14, 2022, bureau, of, reclamation, commissioner, camille, touton, told, the, senate, committee, on, energy, and, natural, resources, that, additional, cuts, of, 2, 4, million, acre, feet, were, required, to, stabilize, reservoir, levels, in, 2023, touton, warned, that, if, states, were, unable, to, negotiate, the, requisite, cuts, the, interior, department, may, use, its, legal, authority, to, cut, releases, when, the, states, were, unable, to, come, to, an, agreement, about, how, to, share, the, proposed, cuts, reclamation, began, the, legal, steps, to, unilaterally, reduce, releases, from, hoover, and, glen, canyon, dams, in, 2023, as, of, december, 2022, the, lower, basin, states, of, nevada, arizona, and, california, had, not, agreed, on, how, to, reduce, water, use, by, the, approximately, 30, required, to, keep, levels, in, lakes, mead, and, powell, from, crashing, the, bureau, of, reclamation, has, projected, that, water, levels, at, lake, powell, could, fall, low, enough, that, by, july, 2023, glen, canyon, dam, would, no, longer, be, able, to, generate, any, hydropower, arizona, proposed, a, plan, that, severely, cut, allocations, to, california, and, california, responded, with, a, plan, that, severely, cut, allocations, to, arizona, failing, to, reach, consensus, in, april, 2023, the, federal, government, proposed, cutting, allocations, to, nevada, arizona, and, california, evenly, which, would, cut, deliveries, by, as, much, as, one, quarter, to, each, state, rather, than, according, to, senior, water, rights, in, may, 2023, the, states, finally, reached, a, temporary, agreement, to, prevent, deadpool, reducing, allocations, by, 3, million, acre, feet, over, three, years, until, the, end, of, 2026, 700, 000, acre, feet, were, to, be, negotiated, later, among, california, arizona, and, nevada, the, cuts, were, less, than, the, federal, government, had, demanded, and, so, further, cuts, will, be, needed, after, 2026, fewer, cuts, were, needed, in, the, short, term, because, the, colorado, river, basin, experienced, an, unusually, rainy, and, snowy, weather, in, early, 2023, the, agreement, also, became, easier, to, negotiate, because, many, cuts, are, being, offset, by, one, time, federal, funding, billions, of, dollars, in, funding, for, programs, in, the, colorado, river, basin, to, recycle, water, increase, efficiency, and, competitive, grants, to, pay, water, rights, holders, not, to, use, water, from, the, river, are, being, provided, by, the, infrastructure, investment, and, jobs, act, and, inflation, reduction, act, and, other, programs, funded, through, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, and, united, states, department, of, the, interior, these, are, projected, to, reduce, demand, by, hundreds, of, thousands, of, acre, feet, per, year, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, often, nourish, extensive, corridors, of, riparian, growth, as, they, traverse, the, arid, desert, regions, of, the, watershed, although, riparian, zones, represent, a, relatively, small, proportion, of, the, basin, and, have, been, affected, by, engineering, projects, and, river, diversion, in, many, places, they, have, the, greatest, biodiversity, of, any, habitat, in, the, basin, the, most, prominent, riparian, zones, along, the, river, occur, along, the, lower, colorado, below, davis, dam, especially, in, the, colorado, river, delta, where, riparian, areas, support, 358, species, of, birds, despite, the, reduction, in, freshwater, flow, and, invasive, plants, such, as, tamarisk, salt, cedar, reduction, of, the, delta, s, size, has, also, threatened, animals, such, as, jaguars, and, the, vaquita, porpoise, which, is, endemic, to, the, gulf, human, development, of, the, colorado, river, has, also, helped, to, create, new, riparian, zones, by, smoothing, the, river, s, seasonal, flow, notably, through, the, grand, canyon, more, than, 1, 600, species, of, plants, grow, in, the, colorado, river, watershed, ranging, from, the, creosote, bush, saguaro, cactus, and, joshua, trees, of, the, sonoran, and, mojave, deserts, to, the, forests, of, the, rocky, mountains, and, other, uplands, composed, mainly, of, ponderosa, pine, subalpine, fir, douglas, fir, and, engelmann, spruce, before, logging, in, the, 19th, century, forests, were, abundant, in, high, elevations, as, far, south, as, the, mexico, u, s, border, and, runoff, from, these, areas, nourished, abundant, grassland, communities, in, river, valleys, some, arid, regions, of, the, watershed, such, as, the, upper, green, river, valley, in, wyoming, canyonlands, national, park, in, utah, and, the, san, pedro, river, valley, in, arizona, and, sonora, supported, extensive, reaches, of, grassland, roamed, by, large, mammals, such, as, buffalo, and, antelope, as, late, as, the, 1860s, near, tucson, arizona, where, now, there, is, only, powder, dry, desert, the, grass, once, reached, as, high, as, the, head, of, a, man, on, horse, back, rivers, and, streams, in, the, colorado, basin, were, once, home, to, 49, species, of, native, fish, of, which, 42, were, endemic, engineering, projects, and, river, regulation, have, led, to, the, extinction, of, four, species, and, severe, declines, in, the, populations, of, 40, species, bonytail, chub, razorback, sucker, colorado, pikeminnow, and, humpback, chub, are, among, those, considered, the, most, at, risk, all, are, unique, to, the, colorado, river, system, and, well, adapted, to, the, river, s, natural, silty, conditions, and, flow, variations, clear, cold, water, released, by, dams, has, significantly, changed, characteristics, of, habitat, for, these, and, other, colorado, river, basin, fishes, a, further, 40, species, that, occur, in, the, river, today, notably, the, brown, trout, were, introduced, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, mainly, for, sport, fishing, historically, the, colorado, transported, from, 85, to, 100, million, short, tons, 77, 000, 000, to, 91, 000, 000, t, of, sediment, or, silt, to, the, gulf, of, california, each, year, second, only, to, the, mississippi, among, north, american, rivers, this, sediment, nourished, wetlands, and, riparian, areas, along, the, river, s, lower, course, particularly, in, its, 3, 000, square, mile, 7, 800, km, 2, delta, once, the, largest, desert, estuary, on, the, continent, currently, the, majority, of, sediments, carried, by, the, colorado, river, are, deposited, at, the, upper, end, of, lake, powell, and, most, of, the, remainder, ends, up, in, lake, mead, various, estimates, place, the, time, it, would, take, for, powell, to, completely, fill, with, silt, at, 300, to, 700, years, dams, trapping, sediment, not, only, pose, damage, to, river, habitat, but, also, threaten, future, operations, of, the, colorado, river, reservoir, system, reduction, in, flow, caused, by, dams, diversions, water, for, thermoelectric, power, stations, and, evaporation, losses, from, reservoirs, the, latter, of, which, consumes, more, than, 15, percent, of, the, river, s, natural, runoff, has, had, severe, ecological, consequences, in, the, colorado, river, delta, and, the, gulf, of, california, historically, the, delta, with, its, large, freshwater, outflow, and, extensive, salt, marshes, provided, an, important, breeding, ground, for, aquatic, species, in, the, gulf, today, s, desiccated, delta, at, only, a, fraction, of, its, former, size, no, longer, provides, suitable, habitat, and, populations, of, fish, shrimp, and, sea, mammals, in, the, gulf, have, seen, a, dramatic, decline, since, 1963, the, only, times, when, the, colorado, river, has, reached, the, ocean, have, been, during, el, ni, o, events, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, reduced, flows, have, led, to, increases, in, the, concentration, of, certain, substances, in, the, lower, river, that, have, impacted, water, quality, salinity, is, one, of, the, major, issues, and, also, leads, to, the, corrosion, of, pipelines, in, agricultural, and, urban, areas, the, lower, colorado, s, salt, content, was, about, 50, parts, per, million, ppm, in, its, natural, state, but, by, the, 1960s, it, had, increased, to, well, over, 2000, ppm, by, the, early, 1970s, there, was, also, serious, concern, about, salinity, caused, by, salts, leached, from, local, soils, by, irrigation, drainage, water, which, were, estimated, to, add, 10, million, short, tons, 9, 100, 000, t, of, excess, salt, to, the, river, per, year, the, colorado, river, basin, salinity, control, act, was, passed, in, 1974, mandating, conservation, practices, including, the, reduction, of, saline, drainage, the, program, reduced, the, annual, load, by, about, 1, 2, million, short, tons, 1, 100, 000, t, but, salinity, remains, an, ongoing, issue, in, 1997, the, usbr, estimated, that, saline, irrigation, water, caused, crop, damages, exceeding, 500, million, in, the, u, s, and, 100, million, in, mexico, further, efforts, have, been, made, to, combat, the, salt, issue, in, the, lower, colorado, including, the, construction, of, a, desalination, plant, at, yuma, in, 2011, the, seven, u, s, states, agreed, upon, a, plan, of, implementation, which, aims, to, reduce, salinity, by, 644, 000, short, tons, 584, 000, t, per, year, by, 2030, in, 2013, the, bureau, of, reclamation, estimated, that, around, 32, million, was, spent, each, year, to, prevent, around, 1, 2, million, tons, of, salt, from, entering, and, damaging, the, colorado, river, agricultural, runoff, containing, pesticide, residues, has, also, been, concentrated, in, the, lower, river, in, greater, amounts, this, has, led, to, fish, kills, six, of, these, events, were, recorded, between, 1964, and, 1968, alone, the, pesticide, issue, is, even, greater, in, streams, and, water, bodies, near, agricultural, lands, irrigated, by, the, imperial, irrigation, district, with, colorado, river, water, in, the, imperial, valley, colorado, river, water, used, for, irrigation, overflows, into, the, new, and, alamo, rivers, and, into, the, salton, sea, both, rivers, and, the, sea, are, among, the, most, polluted, bodies, of, water, in, the, united, states, posing, dangers, not, only, to, aquatic, life, but, to, contact, by, humans, and, migrating, birds, pollution, from, agricultural, runoff, is, not, limited, to, the, lower, river, the, issue, is, also, significant, in, upstream, reaches, such, as, colorado, s, grand, valley, also, a, major, center, of, irrigated, agriculture, large, dams, such, as, hoover, and, glen, canyon, typically, release, water, from, lower, levels, of, their, reservoirs, resulting, in, stable, and, relatively, cold, year, round, temperatures, in, long, reaches, of, the, river, the, colorado, s, average, temperature, once, ranged, from, 85, f, 29, c, at, the, height, of, summer, to, near, freezing, in, winter, but, modern, flows, through, the, grand, canyon, for, example, rarely, deviate, significantly, from, 46, f, 8, c, changes, in, temperature, regime, have, caused, declines, of, native, fish, populations, and, stable, flows, have, enabled, increased, vegetation, growth, obstructing, riverside, habitat, these, flow, patterns, have, also, made, the, colorado, more, dangerous, to, recreational, boaters, people, are, more, likely, to, die, of, hypothermia, in, the, colder, water, and, the, general, lack, of, flooding, allows, rockslides, to, build, up, making, the, river, more, difficult, to, navigate, in, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, renewed, interest, in, restoring, a, limited, water, flow, to, the, delta, in, november, 2012, the, u, s, and, mexico, reached, an, agreement, known, as, minute, 319, permitting, mexico, storage, of, its, water, allotment, in, u, s, reservoirs, during, wet, years, thus, increasing, the, efficiency, with, which, the, water, can, be, used, in, addition, to, renovating, irrigation, canals, in, the, mexicali, valley, to, reduce, leakage, this, will, make, about, 45, 000, acre, feet, 56, 000, 000, m, 3, per, year, available, for, release, to, the, delta, on, average, the, water, will, be, used, to, provide, both, an, annual, base, flow, and, a, spring, pulse, flow, to, mimic, the, river, s, original, snowmelt, driven, regime, the, first, pulse, flow, an, eight, week, release, of, 105, 000, acre, feet, 130, 000, 000, m, 3, was, initiated, on, march, 21, 2014, with, the, aim, of, revitalising, 2, 350, acres, 950, hectares, of, wetland, this, pulse, reached, the, sea, on, may, 16, 2014, marking, the, first, time, in, 16, years, that, any, water, from, the, colorado, flowed, into, the, ocean, and, was, hailed, as, an, experiment, of, historic, political, and, ecological, significance, and, a, landmark, in, u, s, mexican, cooperation, in, conservation, the, pulse, will, be, followed, by, the, steady, release, of, 52, 000, acre, feet, 64, 000, 000, m, 3, over, the, following, three, years, just, a, small, fraction, of, its, average, flow, before, damming, famed, for, its, dramatic, rapids, and, canyons, the, colorado, is, one, of, the, most, well, known, whitewater, rivers, in, the, united, states, and, its, grand, canyon, section, run, by, more, than, 22, 000, people, annually, has, been, called, the, granddaddy, of, rafting, trips, grand, canyon, trips, typically, begin, at, lee, s, ferry, and, take, out, at, diamond, creek, or, lake, mead, they, range, from, one, to, eighteen, days, for, commercial, trips, and, from, two, to, twenty, five, days, for, private, trips, private, noncommercial, trips, are, extremely, difficult, to, arrange, because, the, national, park, service, limits, river, traffic, for, environmental, purposes, people, who, desire, such, a, trip, often, have, to, wait, more, than, 10, years, for, the, opportunity, several, other, sections, of, the, river, and, its, tributaries, are, popular, whitewater, runs, and, many, of, these, are, also, served, by, commercial, outfitters, the, colorado, s, cataract, canyon, and, many, reaches, in, the, colorado, headwaters, are, even, more, heavily, used, than, the, grand, canyon, and, about, 60, 000, boaters, run, a, single, 4, 5, mile, 7, 2, km, section, above, radium, colorado, each, year, the, upper, colorado, also, includes, many, of, the, river, s, most, challenging, rapids, including, those, in, gore, canyon, which, is, considered, so, dangerous, that, boating, is, not, recommended, another, section, of, the, river, above, moab, known, as, the, colorado, daily, or, fisher, towers, section, is, the, most, visited, whitewater, run, in, utah, with, more, than, 77, 000, visitors, in, 2011, alone, the, rapids, of, the, green, river, s, gray, and, desolation, canyons, and, the, less, difficult, goosenecks, section, of, the, lower, san, juan, river, are, also, frequently, traversed, by, boaters, eleven, u, s, national, parks, arches, black, canyon, of, the, gunnison, bryce, canyon, canyonlands, capitol, reef, grand, canyon, mesa, verde, petrified, forest, rocky, mountain, saguaro, and, zion, are, in, the, watershed, in, addition, to, many, national, forests, state, parks, and, recreation, areas, hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and, fishing, are, among, the, multiple, recreation, opportunities, offered, by, these, areas, fisheries, have, declined, in, many, streams, in, the, watershed, especially, in, the, rocky, mountains, because, of, polluted, runoff, from, mining, and, agricultural, activities, the, colorado, s, major, reservoirs, are, also, heavily, traveled, summer, destinations, houseboating, and, water, skiing, are, popular, activities, on, lakes, mead, powell, havasu, and, mojave, as, well, as, flaming, gorge, reservoir, in, utah, and, wyoming, and, navajo, reservoir, in, new, mexico, and, colorado, lake, powell, and, surrounding, glen, canyon, national, recreation, area, received, more, than, two, million, visitors, per, year, in, 2007, while, nearly, 7, 9, million, people, visited, lake, mead, and, the, lake, mead, national, recreation, area, in, 2008, colorado, river, recreation, employs, some, 250, 000, people, and, contributes, 26, billion, each, year, to, the, southwest, economy
