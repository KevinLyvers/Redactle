scholars, paul, raymaekers, an, anthropologist, and, ethnologist, suggests, that, the, name, derives, from, the, combination, of, the, kikongo, and, kihumbu, languages, the, prefix, ki, n, signifies, a, hill, or, inhabited, area, while, nsasa, or, nshasa, refers, to, a, bag, of, salt, according, to, raymackers, kinshasa, was, a, significant, trading, site, where, people, from, the, lower, congo, now, kongo, central, province, and, south, atlantic, ocean, exchanged, salt, for, goods, like, iron, slaves, and, ivory, brought, by, those, from, the, upper, congo, now, tshopo, province, however, hendrik, van, moorsel, an, anthropologist, historian, and, researcher, proposes, that, bateke, fishermen, traded, fish, for, cassava, with, locals, along, the, riverbank, and, the, place, of, this, exchange, was, called, ulio, in, teke, exchange, is, utsaya, and, place, of, exchange, is, intsaya, thus, the, name, evolved, from, ulio, to, intsaya, and, later, under, the, influence, of, kikongo, transformed, into, kintsaya, eventually, becoming, kinshasa, kinshasa, also, known, as, n, shasa, is, regarded, as, the, primary, place, of, exchange, on, the, southern, bank, of, the, pool, malebo, where, bartering, occurred, even, before, the, commercial, boom, of, kintambo, the, name, nshasa, is, believed, to, originate, from, the, teke, verb, tsaya, tsaa, meaning, to, exchange, and, the, noun, intsaya, insaa, referring, to, any, market, or, place, of, exchange, it, was, at, this, location, that, teke, brokers, traded, ivory, and, slaves, from, the, banunu, slave, traders, often, mistaken, for, the, yanzi, for, european, trade, items, brought, by, the, zombo, and, kongo, people, despite, the, various, theories, the, historical, name, of, kinshasa, is, known, to, have, been, nshasa, as, documented, by, henry, morton, stanley, during, his, crossing, of, africa, from, zanzibar, to, boma, in, 1874, 1877, when, he, mentioned, visiting, the, king, of, nshasa, on, 14, march,
