mount, pel, e, or, mont, pel, e, p, l, e, p, lay, french, montagne, pel, e, antillean, creole, montann, p, l, meaning, bald, mountain, or, peeled, mountain, in, french, is, an, active, volcano, at, the, northern, end, of, martinique, an, island, and, french, overseas, department, in, the, lesser, antilles, volcanic, arc, of, the, caribbean, its, volcanic, cone, is, composed, of, stratified, layers, of, hardened, ash, and, solidified, lava, its, most, recent, eruption, was, in, 1932, the, stratovolcano, s, 1902, eruption, destroyed, the, town, of, saint, pierre, killing, 29, 000, to, 30, 000, people, in, the, space, of, a, few, minutes, in, the, worst, volcanic, disaster, of, the, 20th, century, the, main, eruption, on, 8, may, 1902, left, only, three, known, survivors, ludger, sylbaris, survived, because, he, was, in, a, poorly, ventilated, dungeon, like, jail, cell, l, on, comp, re, l, andre, living, on, the, edge, of, the, city, escaped, with, severe, burns, the, third, was, a, young, girl, named, havivra, da, ifrile, who, fled, to, a, nearby, sea, cave, in, a, boat, enduring, burns, from, falling, ash, in, 2023, it, was, listed, as, unesco, world, heritage, site, mount, pel, e, is, the, result, of, a, typical, subduction, zone, the, subduction, formed, the, lesser, antilles, island, arc, a, curved, chain, of, volcanoes, approximately, 850, kilometres, 530, mi, in, length, between, puerto, rico, and, venezuela, where, the, caribbean, plate, meets, atlantic, oceanic, crust, belonging, to, the, south, american, plate, other, volcanoes, in, the, island, arc, are, also, known, for, their, volcanic, activity, including, saint, vincent, s, la, soufri, re, guadeloupe, s, la, grande, soufriere, volcano, montserrat, s, soufri, re, hills, and, the, submarine, volcano, kick, em, jenny, volcanologists, have, identified, three, different, phases, in, the, evolution, of, mount, pel, e, volcano, initial, intermediate, and, modern, in, an, initial, phase, called, the, pal, o, pel, e, stage, mount, pelee, was, a, common, stratovolcano, the, cone, of, pal, o, pel, e, was, composed, of, many, layers, of, lava, flows, and, fragmented, volcanic, debris, remains, of, the, pal, o, pel, e, cone, are, still, visible, at, the, northern, view, at, the, volcano, today, a, second, stage, now, called, the, intermediate, phase, started, around, 100, 000, years, ago, after, a, long, period, of, quiescence, this, stage, is, grouped, by, the, formation, of, the, morne, macouba, lava, dome, then, later, on, the, morne, macouba, caldera, during, the, intermediate, phase, there, were, several, eruptions, which, produced, pyroclastic, flows, like, those, that, destroyed, saint, pierre, in, the, 1902, eruption, around, 25, 000, years, ago, a, large, southwest, sector, collapse, occurred, forming, a, landslide, this, event, was, similar, to, the, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, in, 1980, the, modern, stage, of, the, evolution, of, mount, pel, e, has, created, most, of, the, current, cone, with, deposits, of, pumice, and, the, results, of, past, pyroclastic, flows, more, than, 30, eruptions, have, been, identified, during, the, last, 5, 000, years, of, the, volcano, s, activity, three, thousand, years, ago, following, a, large, pumice, eruption, the, tang, sec, french, for, dry, pond, caldera, was, then, formed, the, 1902, eruption, took, place, within, the, tang, sec, crater, this, eruption, formed, many, pyroclastic, flows, and, produced, a, dome, that, filled, the, caldera, mount, pel, e, continued, to, erupt, until, 4, july, 1905, thereafter, the, volcano, was, dormant, until, 1929, on, 16, september, 1929, mount, pel, e, began, to, erupt, again, this, time, there, was, no, hesitation, on, the, part, of, authorities, and, the, danger, area, was, immediately, evacuated, the, 1929, eruption, formed, a, second, dome, in, the, tang, sec, caldera, and, produced, pyroclastic, flows, emptying, into, the, blanche, river, valley, although, there, were, pyroclastic, flows, the, activity, was, not, as, violent, as, the, 1902, activity, it, culminated, in, another, spine, or, lava, plug, albeit, smaller, than, the, 1902, plug, being, emplaced, at, the, summit, the, activity, ended, in, late, 1932, the, volcano, is, currently, active, a, few, volcano, tectonic, earthquakes, occur, on, martinique, every, year, and, mount, pel, e, is, under, continuous, watch, by, geophysicists, and, volcanologists, ipgp, before, the, 1902, eruption, as, early, as, the, summer, of, 1900, signs, of, increased, fumarole, activity, were, present, in, the, tang, sec, crater, relatively, minor, phreatic, steam, eruptions, that, occurred, in, 1792, and, 1851, were, evidence, that, the, volcano, was, active, signs, of, unrest, are, likely, to, precede, any, future, eruptive, activity, from, mount, pel, e, and, its, past, activity, including, the, violent, eruptions, uncovered, by, carbon, dating, is, an, extremely, important, factor, for, hazard, assessment, the, city, of, saint, pierre, was, never, fully, rebuilt, though, some, villages, grew, up, in, its, place, the, estimated, population, of, the, commune, of, saint, pierre, in, 2017, was, 4, 123, on, december, 6, 2020, the, martinique, volcano, observatory, mvo, raised, mount, pelee, s, alert, level, to, yellow, from, green, due, to, an, increase, in, seismicity, under, the, volcano, beginning, in, april, 2019, and, observations, of, tremors, the, previous, month, as, far, as, was, known, this, was, the, first, sign, of, activity, since, the, end, of, the, 1929, 1932, eruption, this, volcano, is, of, course, highly, dangerous, and, great, vigilance, of, its, activity, is, required, whether, or, not, it, is, going, to, enter, a, new, eruptive, period, is, currently, unknown, according, to, the, mvo, press, release, the, increase, in, seismicity, of, superficial, volcanic, origin, up, to, 4, 5, km, 2, 5, 3, mi, below, the, summit, observed, since, april, 2019, is, therefore, clearly, above, the, base, level, characteristic, for, mount, pel, e, in, april, 2019, volcanic, seismicity, appeared, at, depth, around, and, under, mount, pel, e, more, than, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, below, sea, level, it, could, correspond, to, the, arrival, at, depth, of, magmatic, fluids, finally, new, recorded, tremor, type, signals, were, observed, on, november, 8, and, 9, 2020, they, could, correspond, to, a, reactivation, of, the, hydrothermal, system, even, if, in, the, current, state, of, measurements, there, is, no, deformation, of, the, volcano, on, the, scale, of, the, observation, network, the, appearance, in, a, few, months, of, these, three, different, types, of, seismic, signals, of, volcanic, origin, shows, a, clear, change, in, the, behavior, of, the, volcanic, system, the, activity, of, which, is, increasing, from, the, base, level, observed, over, several, decades, the, martinique, volcano, frog, allobates, chalcopis, is, endemic, to, mount, pel, e, and, the, only, species, among, related, frogs, family, aromobatidae, endemic, to, an, oceanic, island, a, 9, 262, ha, 22, 890, acre, largely, forested, tract, encompassing, the, mountain, and, extending, to, the, sea, on, its, north, western, side, has, been, recognised, as, an, important, bird, area, iba, by, birdlife, international, because, it, supports, populations, of, bridled, quail, doves, lesser, antillean, swifts, green, and, purple, throated, caribs, blue, headed, and, antillean, crested, hummingbirds, caribbean, elaenias, lesser, antillean, flycatchers, lesser, antillean, pewees, scaly, breasted, and, pearly, eyed, thrashers, brown, and, grey, tremblers, rufous, throated, solitaires, antillean, euphonias, martinique, orioles, lesser, antillean, saltators, and, lesser, antillean, bullfinches, on, september, 16, 2023, the, volcanoes, and, forests, of, mount, pel, e, and, the, pitons, of, northern, martinique, were, listed, as, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, volcanic, mountain, range, represents, 12, of, martinique, s, territory, it, is, the, 7th, natural, site, in, france, to, be, listed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, world, heritage, status, could, also, have, a, positive, impact, on, tourism, and, the, economy, increasing, visitor, numbers, by, 30, to, 40, according, to, the, martinique, nature, park
