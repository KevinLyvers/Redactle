milan, is, credited, to, two, celtic, peoples, the, bituriges, and, the, aedui, having, as, their, emblems, a, ram, and, a, boar, therefore, the, city, s, symbol, is, a, wool, bearing, boar, an,

of, the, roman, monarchy, during, the, reign, of, tarquinius, priscus, tarquin, is, traditionally, recorded, as, reigning, from, 616, to, 579, bc, according, to, ancient, roman, historian, titus, livy, medhelanon, in, particular, was, developed, around, a, sanctuary, which, was, the, oldest, area, of, the, village, the, sanctuary, which, consisted, of, a, wooded, area, in, the, shape, of, an, ellipse, with, a, central, clearing, was, aligned, according, to, precise, astronomical, points, for, this, reason, it, was, used, for, religious, gatherings, especially, in, particular, celebratory, moments, the, sanctuary, of, medhelanon, was, an, ellipse, with, axes, of, 443, m, 1, 453, ft, and, 323, m, 1, 060, ft, located, near, piazza, della, scala, the, urban, planning, profile, was, based, on, these, early, paths, and, on, the, shape, of, the, sanctuary, reached, in, some, cases, up, to, the, 19th, century, and, even, beyond, for, example, the, route, of, the, modern, corso, vittorio, emanuele, piazza, del, duomo, piazza, cordusio, and, via, broletto, which, is, curvilinear, could, correspond, to, the, south, side, of, the, ellipse, of, the, ancient, sanctuary, of, medhelanon, one, axis, of, the, medhelanon, sanctuary, was, aligned, towards, the, heliacal, rising, of, antares, while, the, other, towards, the, heliacal, rising, of, capella, the, latter, coincided, with, a, celtic, spring, festival, celebrated, on, 24, march, while, the, heliacal, rising, of, antares, corresponded, with, 11, november, which, opened, and, closed, the, celtic, year, and, which, coincided, with, the, point, where, the, sun, rose, on, the, winter, solstice, about, two, centuries, after, the, creation, of, the, celtic, sanctuary, the, first, residential, settlements, began, to, be, built, around, it, medhelanon, then, transformed, from, a, simple, religious, center, to, an, urban, and, then, military, centre, thus, becoming, a, real, village, the, first, homes, were, built, just, south, of, the, celtic, sanctuary, near, the, modern, royal, palace, of, milan, subsequently, with, the, growth, of, the, town, centre, other, important, buildings, for, the, medhelanon, community, were, built, first, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, goddess, belisama, was, built, which, was, located, near, the, modern, milan, cathedral, then, near, the, modern, via, moneta, which, is, located, near, today, s, piazza, san, sepolcro, a, fortified, building, with, military, functions, was, built, which, was, surrounded, by, a, defensive, moat, during, the, roman, republic, the, romans, led, by, consul, gnaeus, cornelius, scipio, calvus, fought, the, insubres, and, captured, the, settlement, in, 222, bc, the, chief, of, the, insubres, then, submitted, to, rome, giving, the, romans, control, of, the, settlement, the, romans, eventually, conquered, the, entirety, of, the, region, calling, the, new, province, cisalpine, gaul, latin, gallia, cisalpina, gaul, this, side, of, the, alps, and, may, have, given, the, city, its, latinized, name, of, mediolanum, in, gaulish, medio, meant, middle, centre, and, the, name, element, lanon, is, the, celtic, equivalent, of, latin, planum, plain, thus, mediolanon, latinized, as, mediol, num, meant, settlement, in, the, midst, of, the, plain, mediolanum, became, the, most, important, center, of, cisalpine, gaul, and, in, the, wake, of, economic, development, in, 49, bc, was, elevated, within, the, lex, roscia, to, the, status, of, municipium, the, ancient, celtic, settlement, was, from, a, topographic, point, of, view, superimposed, and, replaced, by, the, roman, one, the, roman, city, was, then, gradually, superimposed, and, replaced, by, the, medieval, one, the, urban, center, of, milan, has, therefore, grown, constantly, and, rapidly, until, modern, times, around, the, first, celtic, nucleus, the, original, celtic, toponym, medhelanon, then, changed, as, evidenced, by, a, graffiti, in, celtic, language, present, on, a,
