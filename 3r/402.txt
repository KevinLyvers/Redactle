the, atacama, desert, spanish, desierto, de, atacama, is, a, desert, plateau, located, on, the, pacific, coast, of, south, america, in, the, north, of, chile, stretching, over, a, 1, 600, kilometre, long, 1, 000, mile, strip, of, land, west, of, the, andes, mountains, it, covers, an, area, of, 105, 000, km, 2, 41, 000, sq, mi, which, increases, to, 128, 000, km, 2, 49, 000, sq, mi, if, the, barren, lower, slopes, of, the, andes, are, included, the, atacama, desert, is, the, driest, nonpolar, desert, in, the, world, and, the, second, driest, overall, behind, some, specific, spots, within, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, it, is, the, only, true, desert, to, receive, less, precipitation, than, polar, deserts, and, the, largest, fog, desert, in, the, world, the, area, has, been, used, as, an, experimentation, site, for, mars, expedition, simulations, due, to, its, similarities, to, the, martian, environment, the, constant, temperature, inversion, caused, by, the, cool, north, flowing, humboldt, ocean, current, and, the, strong, pacific, anticyclone, contribute, to, the, extreme, aridity, of, the, desert, the, most, arid, region, of, the, atacama, desert, is, situated, between, two, mountain, chains, the, andes, and, the, chilean, coast, range, which, are, high, enough, to, prevent, moisture, advection, from, either, the, pacific, or, the, atlantic, ocean, creating, a, two, sided, rain, shadow, effect, according, to, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, the, atacama, desert, ecoregion, occupies, a, continuous, strip, for, nearly, 1, 600, kilometres, 1, 000, mi, along, the, narrow, coast, of, the, northern, third, of, chile, from, near, arica, 18, 24, s, southward, to, near, la, serena, 29, 55, s, the, national, geographic, society, considers, the, coastal, area, of, southern, peru, to, be, part, of, the, atacama, desert, and, includes, the, deserts, south, of, the, ica, region, in, peru, however, other, sources, consider, that, the, part, of, the, desert, in, peru, is, a, different, ecosystem, and, should, properly, be, named, as, pampas, de, la, joya, desert, peru, borders, it, on, the, north, and, the, chilean, matorral, ecoregion, borders, it, on, the, south, to, the, east, lies, the, less, arid, central, andean, dry, puna, ecoregion, the, drier, portion, of, this, ecoregion, is, located, south, of, the, loa, river, between, the, parallel, sierra, vicu, a, mackenna, and, the, cordillera, domeyko, to, the, north, of, the, loa, lies, the, pampa, del, tamarugal, the, coastal, cliff, of, northern, chile, west, of, the, chilean, coast, range, is, the, main, topographical, feature, of, the, coast, the, geomorphology, of, the, atacama, desert, has, been, characterized, as, a, low, relief, bench, similar, to, a, giant, uplifted, terrace, by, armijo, and, co, workers, the, intermediate, depression, or, central, valley, forms, a, series, of, endorheic, basins, in, much, of, the, atacama, desert, south, of, latitude, 19, 30, s, north, of, this, latitude, the, intermediate, depression, drains, into, the, pacific, ocean, in, december, 2023, scientists, for, the, first, time, reported, on, a, recently, discovered, area, in, the, territory, of, puna, de, atacama, which, may, have, similarities, to, earth, during, the, archean, eon, and, thus, to, the, environment, of, the, first, life, forms, on, earth, it, could, as, well, be, similar, to, conceivably, hospitable, conditions, on, the, planet, mars, during, earlier, martian, times, the, almost, total, lack, of, precipitation, is, the, most, prominent, characteristic, of, the, atacama, desert, the, atacama, desert, is, commonly, known, as, the, driest, place, in, the, world, especially, the, surroundings, of, the, abandoned, yungay, mining, town, where, the, university, of, antofagasta, desert, research, station, is, located, in, antofagasta, region, chile, the, average, rainfall, is, about, 15, mm, 0, 6, in, per, year, although, some, locations, only, receive, 1, to, 3, mm, 0, 04, to, 0, 12, in, in, a, year, moreover, some, weather, stations, in, the, atacama, have, never, received, rain, periods, up, to, four, years, have, been, registered, with, no, rainfall, in, the, central, sector, delimited, by, the, cities, of, antofagasta, calama, and, copiap, in, chile, evidence, suggests, that, the, atacama, may, not, have, had, any, significant, rainfall, from, 1570, to, 1971, the, atacama, desert, may, be, the, oldest, desert, on, earth, and, has, experienced, hyper, aridity, since, at, least, the, middle, miocene, since, the, establishment, of, a, proto, humboldt, current, in, conjunction, with, the, opening, of, the, tasmania, antarctic, passage, ca, 33, ma, the, opening, of, the, tasmania, antarctic, passage, allowed, for, cold, currents, to, move, along, the, west, coast, of, south, america, which, influenced, the, availability, of, warm, humid, air, to, travel, from, the, amazon, basin, to, the, atacama, though, there, was, a, general, lack, of, humid, air, after, 33, ma, there, were, punctuated, intervals, of, increased, humidity, such, as, between, around, 10, 86, and, 6, 4, ma, when, the, tiliviche, palaeolake, existed, before, turning, into, a, salar, sometime, before, the, middle, pliocene, the, long, history, of, aridity, raises, the, possibility, that, supergene, mineralisation, under, the, appropriate, conditions, can, form, in, arid, environments, instead, of, requiring, humid, conditions, the, presence, of, evaporite, formations, suggests, that, in, some, sections, of, the, atacama, desert, arid, conditions, have, persisted, for, the, last, 200, million, years, since, the, triassic, aridity, in, atacama, desert, predates, the, rise, of, the, central, andes, yet, hyper, aridity, is, generally, thought, to, have, resulted, from, the, rise, of, the, andes, as, such, it, is, hypothesised, it, had, climatic, conditions, akin, to, the, namib, desert, prior, to, the, rise, of, the, mountains, the, atacama, is, so, arid, that, many, mountains, higher, than, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, are, completely, free, of, glaciers, only, the, highest, peaks, such, as, ojos, del, salado, monte, pissis, and, debatably, llullaillaco, have, some, permanent, snow, coverage, the, southern, part, of, the, desert, between, 25, and, 27, s, may, have, been, glacier, free, throughout, the, quaternary, including, during, glaciations, though, permafrost, extends, down, to, an, altitude, of, 4, 400, m, 14, 400, ft, and, is, continuous, above, 5, 600, m, 18, 400, ft, studies, by, a, group, of, british, scientists, have, suggested, that, some, river, beds, have, been, dry, for, 120, 000, years, however, some, locations, in, the, atacama, receive, a, marine, fog, known, locally, as, the, camanchaca, providing, sufficient, moisture, for, hypolithic, algae, lichens, and, even, some, cacti, the, genus, copiapoa, is, notable, among, these, geographically, the, aridity, of, the, atacama, is, explained, by, its, being, situated, between, two, mountain, chains, the, andes, and, the, chilean, coast, range, of, sufficient, height, to, prevent, moisture, advection, from, either, the, pacific, or, the, atlantic, oceans, a, two, sided, rain, shadow, despite, modern, views, of, the, atacama, desert, as, fully, devoid, of, vegetation, in, pre, columbian, and, colonial, times, a, large, flatland, area, there, known, as, pampa, del, tamarugal, was, a, woodland, but, demand, for, firewood, associated, with, silver, and, saltpeter, mining, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, resulted, in, widespread, deforestation, in, a, region, about, 100, km, 60, mi, south, of, antofagasta, which, averages, 3, 000, m, 10, 000, ft, in, elevation, the, soil, has, been, compared, to, that, of, mars, owing, to, its, otherworldly, appearance, the, atacama, has, been, used, as, a, location, for, filming, mars, scenes, most, notably, in, the, television, series, space, odyssey, voyage, to, the, planets, in, 2003, a, team, of, researchers, published, a, report, in, which, they, duplicated, the, tests, used, by, the, viking, 1, and, viking, 2, mars, landers, to, detect, life, and, were, unable, to, detect, any, signs, in, atacama, desert, soil, in, the, region, of, yungay, the, region, may, be, unique, on, earth, in, this, regard, and, is, being, used, by, nasa, to, test, instruments, for, future, mars, missions, the, team, duplicated, the, viking, tests, in, mars, like, earth, environments, and, found, that, they, missed, present, signs, of, life, in, soil, samples, from, antarctic, dry, valleys, the, atacama, desert, of, chile, and, peru, and, other, locales, however, in, 2014, a, new, hyperarid, site, was, reported, mar, a, elena, south, which, was, much, drier, than, yungay, and, thus, a, better, mars, like, environment, towards, atacama, near, the, deserted, coast, you, see, a, land, without, men, where, there, is, not, a, bird, not, a, beast, nor, a, tree, nor, any, vegetation, la, araucana, by, alonso, de, ercilla, 1569, in, 2008, the, phoenix, mars, lander, detected, perchlorates, on, the, surface, of, mars, at, the, same, site, where, water, was, first, discovered, perchlorates, are, also, found, in, the, atacama, and, associated, nitrate, deposits, have, contained, organics, leading, to, speculation, that, signs, of, life, on, mars, are, not, incompatible, with, perchlorates, the, atacama, is, also, a, testing, site, for, the, nasa, funded, earth, mars, cave, detection, program, on, 21, february, 2023, scientists, reported, the, findings, of, a, dark, microbiome, of, unfamiliar, microorganisms, in, the, atacama, desert, in, june, 1991, antofagasta, and, taltal, and, inland, regions, as, far, as, calama, received, unusual, rainfall, leading, to, formation, of, a, series, of, mudflows, that, killed, 91, persons, in, 2012, the, altiplano, winter, brought, floods, to, san, pedro, de, atacama, on, 25, march, 2015, heavy, rainfall, affected, the, southern, part, of, the, atacama, desert, resulting, floods, triggered, mudflows, that, affected, the, cities, of, copiapo, tierra, amarilla, chanaral, and, diego, de, almagro, causing, the, deaths, of, more, than, 100, people, in, spite, of, the, geographic, and, climatic, conditions, of, the, desert, a, rich, variety, of, flora, has, evolved, there, over, 500, species, have, been, gathered, within, the, border, of, this, desert, these, species, are, characterized, by, their, extraordinary, ability, to, adapt, to, this, extreme, environment, the, most, common, species, are, herbs, and, flowers, such, as, thyme, llareta, and, saltgrass, distichlis, spicata, and, where, humidity, is, sufficient, trees, such, as, the, cha, ar, geoffroea, decorticans, the, pimiento, tree, and, the, leafy, algarrobo, prosopis, chilensis, the, llareta, is, one, of, the, highest, growing, wood, species, in, the, world, it, is, found, at, altitudes, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, m, 9, 800, and, 16, 400, ft, its, dense, form, is, similar, to, a, pillow, some, 3, to, 4, m, 9, 8, to, 13, 1, ft, thick, it, concentrates, and, retains, the, heat, from, the, day, to, cope, with, low, evening, temperatures, the, growth, rate, of, the, llareta, has, been, recently, estimated, at, 1, 5, cm, year, 0, 59, in, year, making, many, llaretas, over, 3, 000, years, old, it, produces, a, much, prized, resin, which, the, mining, industry, once, harvested, indiscriminately, as, fuel, making, this, plant, endangered, the, desert, is, also, home, to, cacti, succulents, and, other, plants, that, thrive, in, a, dry, climate, cactus, species, here, include, the, candelabro, browningia, candelaris, and, cardon, echinopsis, atacamensis, which, can, reach, a, height, of, 7, m, 23, ft, and, a, diameter, of, 70, cm, 28, in, the, atacama, desert, flowering, spanish, desierto, florido, can, be, seen, from, september, to, november, in, years, with, sufficient, precipitation, as, happened, in, 2015, the, climate, of, the, atacama, desert, limits, the, number, of, animals, living, permanently, in, this, extreme, ecosystem, some, parts, of, the, desert, are, so, arid, no, plant, or, animal, life, can, survive, outside, of, these, extreme, areas, sand, colored, grasshoppers, blend, with, pebbles, on, the, desert, floor, and, beetles, and, their, larvae, provide, a, valuable, food, source, in, the, lomas, hills, desert, wasps, and, butterflies, can, be, found, during, the, warm, and, humid, season, especially, on, the, lomas, red, scorpions, also, live, in, the, desert, a, unique, environment, is, provided, by, some, lomas, where, the, fog, from, the, ocean, provides, enough, moisture, for, seasonal, plants, and, a, few, animal, species, surprisingly, few, reptile, species, inhabit, the, desert, and, even, fewer, amphibian, species, chaunus, atacamensis, the, vallenar, toad, or, atacama, toad, lives, on, the, lomas, where, it, lays, eggs, in, permanent, ponds, or, streams, iguanians, and, lava, lizards, inhabit, parts, of, the, desert, while, salt, flat, lizards, liolaemus, live, in, the, dry, areas, bordering, the, ocean, one, species, liolaemus, fabiani, is, endemic, to, the, salar, de, atacama, the, atacama, salt, flat, birds, are, one, of, the, most, diverse, animal, groups, in, the, atacama, humboldt, penguins, live, year, round, along, the, coast, nesting, in, desert, cliffs, overlooking, the, ocean, inland, high, altitude, salt, flats, are, inhabited, by, andean, flamingos, while, chilean, flamingos, can, be, seen, along, the, coast, other, birds, including, species, of, hummingbirds, and, rufous, collared, sparrow, visit, the, lomas, seasonally, to, feed, on, insects, nectar, seeds, and, flowers, the, lomas, help, sustain, several, threatened, species, such, as, the, endangered, chilean, woodstar, because, of, the, desert, s, extreme, aridity, only, a, few, specially, adapted, mammal, species, live, in, the, atacama, such, as, darwin, s, leaf, eared, mouse, the, less, arid, parts, of, the, desert, are, inhabited, by, the, south, american, gray, fox, and, the, viscacha, a, relative, of, the, chinchilla, larger, animals, such, as, guanacos, and, vicu, as, graze, in, areas, where, grass, grows, mainly, because, it, is, seasonally, irrigated, by, melted, snow, vicu, as, need, to, remain, near, a, steady, water, supply, while, guanacos, can, roam, into, more, arid, areas, and, survive, longer, without, fresh, water, south, american, fur, seals, and, south, american, sea, lions, often, gather, along, the, coast, the, atacama, is, sparsely, populated, with, most, towns, located, along, the, pacific, coast, in, interior, areas, oases, and, some, valleys, have, been, populated, for, millennia, and, were, the, location, of, the, most, advanced, pre, columbian, societies, found, in, chile, the, chinchorro, culture, developed, in, the, atacama, desert, area, from, 7000, bce, to, 1500, bce, these, peoples, were, sedentary, fishermen, inhabiting, mostly, coastal, areas, their, presence, is, found, from, today, s, towns, of, ilo, in, southern, peru, to, antofagasta, in, northern, chile, presence, of, fresh, water, in, the, arid, region, on, the, coast, facilitated, human, settlement, in, these, areas, the, chinchorro, were, famous, for, their, detailed, mummification, and, funerary, practices, san, pedro, de, atacama, at, about, 2, 400, m, 8, 000, ft, elevation, is, like, many, of, the, small, towns, before, the, inca, empire, and, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, the, extremely, arid, interior, was, inhabited, primarily, by, the, atacame, o, tribe, they, are, noted, for, building, fortified, towns, called, pucar, s, one, of, which, is, located, a, few, kilometers, from, san, pedro, de, atacama, the, town, s, church, was, built, by, the, spanish, in, 1577, the, atacame, o, were, an, extinct, south, american, indian, culture, different, from, the, aymara, to, the, north, and, the, diaguita, to, the, south, the, oasis, settlement, of, pica, has, pre, hispanic, origins, and, served, as, an, important, stopover, for, transit, between, the, coast, and, the, altiplano, during, the, time, of, the, inca, empire, the, coastal, cities, originated, in, the, 16th, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, during, the, time, of, the, spanish, empire, when, they, emerged, as, shipping, ports, for, silver, produced, in, potos, and, other, mining, centers, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, carlos, iv, defines, the, southern, border, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, at, the, port, of, nuestra, se, ora, del, paposo, during, the, 19th, century, the, desert, came, under, control, of, bolivia, chile, and, peru, with, the, discovery, of, sodium, nitrate, deposits, and, as, a, result, of, chilean, expansion, plans, the, area, soon, became, a, zone, of, conflict, and, resulted, in, the, war, of, the, pacific, chile, annexed, most, of, the, desert, and, cities, along, the, coast, developed, into, international, ports, hosting, many, chilean, workers, who, migrated, there, with, the, guano, and, saltpeter, booms, of, the, 19th, century, the, population, grew, immensely, mostly, as, a, result, of, immigration, from, central, chile, in, the, 20th, century, the, nitrate, industry, declined, and, at, the, same, time, the, largely, male, population, of, the, desert, became, increasingly, problematic, for, the, chilean, state, miners, and, mining, companies, came, into, conflict, and, protests, spread, throughout, the, region, around, 1900, there, were, irrigation, system, of, puquios, spread, through, the, oases, of, atacama, desert, puquios, are, known, from, the, valleys, of, azapa, and, sibaya, and, the, oases, of, la, calera, pica, matilla, and, puquio, de, n, ez, in, 1918, geologist, juan, br, ggen, mentioned, the, existence, of, 23, socavones, shafts, in, the, pica, oasis, yet, these, have, since, been, abandoned, due, to, economic, and, social, changes, the, desert, has, rich, deposits, of, copper, and, other, minerals, and, the, world, s, largest, natural, supply, of, sodium, nitrate, chile, saltpeter, which, was, mined, on, a, large, scale, until, the, early, 1940s, the, atacama, border, dispute, over, these, resources, between, chile, and, bolivia, began, in, the, 19th, century, and, resulted, in, the, war, of, the, pacific, the, desert, is, littered, with, about, 170, abandoned, nitrate, or, saltpeter, mining, towns, almost, all, of, which, were, shut, down, decades, after, the, invention, of, synthetic, nitrate, in, germany, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, see, haber, process, the, towns, include, chacabuco, humberstone, santa, laura, pedro, de, valdivia, puelma, mar, a, elena, and, oficina, anita, the, atacama, desert, is, rich, in, metallic, mineral, resources, such, as, copper, gold, silver, and, iron, as, well, as, nonmetallic, minerals, including, important, deposits, of, boron, lithium, sodium, nitrate, and, potassium, salts, the, salar, de, atacama, is, where, bischofite, is, extracted, these, resources, are, exploited, by, various, mining, companies, such, as, codelco, lomas, bayas, mantos, blancos, and, soquimich, in, recent, years, large, amounts, of, used, clothing, imported, from, overseas, have, begun, to, accumulate, in, portions, of, the, desert, because, of, the, dry, conditions, they, do, not, decompose, at, the, normal, rate, and, fires, have, exposed, nearby, residents, to, air, pollution, because, of, its, high, altitude, nearly, nonexistent, cloud, cover, dry, air, and, freedom, from, light, pollution, and, radio, interference, from, widely, populated, cities, and, towns, this, desert, is, one, of, the, best, places, in, the, world, to, conduct, astronomical, observations, hundreds, of, thousands, of, stars, can, be, viewed, via, telescope, since, the, desert, experiences, more, than, 200, cloudless, nights, each, year, a, number, of, telescopes, have, been, installed, to, help, astronomers, from, across, the, globe, study, the, universe, a, radio, astronomy, telescope, called, the, atacama, large, millimeter, array, built, by, european, countries, japan, the, united, states, canada, and, chile, in, the, llano, de, chajnantor, observatory, officially, opened, on, 3, october, 2011, a, number, of, radio, astronomy, projects, such, as, the, cbi, the, aste, and, the, act, among, others, have, been, operating, in, the, chajnantor, area, since, 1999, on, 26, april, 2010, the, eso, council, decided, to, build, a, fourth, site, cerro, armazones, to, be, home, to, the, extremely, large, telescope, construction, work, at, the, elt, site, started, in, june, 2014, the, carnegie, institution, for, science, operates, the, las, campanas, observatory, with, several, telescope, in, the, southern, portion, of, the, desert, the, european, southern, observatory, operates, three, major, observatories, in, the, atacama, and, is, currently, building, a, fourth, the, atacama, desert, is, popular, with, all, terrain, sports, enthusiasts, various, championships, have, taken, place, here, including, the, lower, atacama, rally, lower, chile, rally, patagonia, atacama, rally, and, the, latter, dakar, rally, s, editions, the, rally, was, organized, by, the, amaury, sport, organisation, and, held, in, 2009, 2010, 2011,

through, the, desert, from, 15, 19, november, 2012, most, people, who, go, to, tour, the, sites, in, the, desert, stay, in, the, town, of, san, pedro, de, atacama, the, atacama, desert, is, in, the, top, three, tourist, locations, in, chile, the, specially, commissioned, eso, hotel, is, reserved, for, astronomers, and, scientists, about, 80, geysers, occur, in, a, valley, about, 80, km, from, the, town, of, san, pedro, de, atacama, they, are, closer, to, the, town, of, chiu, chiu, the, ba, os, de, puritama, are, rock, pools, which, are, 60, kilometres, 37, miles, from, the, geysers
