also, the, idea, that, one, is, not, speaking, in, the, correct, manner, of, legitimate, mayan, dialect, which, also, causes, for, more, differences, in, the, accent, and, overall, language, of, the,

radio, internet, and, tv, many, elements, of, the, culture, and, language, of, the, rest, of, mexico, are, now, slowly, but, consistently, permeating, the, culture, apart, from, the, mayan, language,
