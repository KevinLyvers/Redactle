excess, deaths, from, hunger, and, illness, the, total, number, of, conflict, related, deaths, during, this, period, is, difficult, to, determine, due, to, a, lack, of, data, one, estimate, based, on, portuguese, indonesian, and, catholic, church, data, suggests, it, may, have, been, as, high, as, 200, 000, repression, and, restrictions, counteracted, improvements, in, health, and, education, infrastructure, and, services, meaning, there, was, little, overall, improvement, in, living, standards, economic, growth, mostly, benefited, immigrants, from, elsewhere, in, indonesia, 271, a, huge,

proposed, models, would, create, different, levels, of, administration, between, the, sucos, and, the, central, government, in, most, proposals, there, were, no, specific, provisions, for, suco, level, governance, and, they, were, expected, to, continue, to, exist, as, mostly, traditional, spaces, identifying, communities, rather, than, being, part, of, the, civil, administration, in, the,
