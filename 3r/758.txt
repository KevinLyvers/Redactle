https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb
a, suburb, more, broadly, suburban, area, is, an, area, within, a, metropolitan, area, which, is, predominantly, residential, and, within, commuting, distance, of, a, large, city, suburbs, can, have, their, own, political, or, legal, jurisdiction, especially, in, the, united, states, but, this, is, not, always, the, case, especially, in, the, united, kingdom, where, most, suburbs, are, located, within, the, administrative, boundaries, of, cities, in, most, english, speaking, countries, suburban, areas, are, defined, in, contrast, to, central, city, or, inner, city, areas, but, in, australian, english, and, south, african, english, suburb, has, become, largely, synonymous, with, what, is, called, a, neighborhood, in, the, u, s, due, in, part, to, historical, trends, such, as, white, flight, some, suburbs, in, the, united, states, have, a, higher, population, and, higher, incomes, than, their, nearby, inner, cities, in, some, countries, including, india, china, new, zealand, canada, the, united, kingdom, and, parts, of, the, united, states, new, suburbs, are, routinely, annexed, by, adjacent, cities, due, to, urban, sprawl, in, others, such, as, morocco, france, and, much, of, the, united, states, many, suburbs, remain, separate, municipalities, or, are, governed, locally, as, part, of, a, larger, metropolitan, area, such, as, a, county, district, or, borough, in, the, united, states, regions, beyond, the, suburbs, are, known, as, exurban, areas, or, exurbs, exurbs, have, less, population, density, than, suburbs, but, still, more, than, rural, areas, suburbs, and, exurbs, are, sometimes, linked, to, the, nearby, city, economically, particularly, by, commuters, suburbs, first, emerged, on, a, large, scale, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, as, a, result, of, improved, rail, and, road, transport, which, led, to, an, increase, in, commuting, in, general, they, are, less, densely, populated, than, inner, city, neighborhoods, within, the, same, metropolitan, area, and, most, residents, routinely, commute, to, city, centers, or, business, districts, via, private, vehicles, or, public, transits, however, there, are, many, exceptions, including, industrial, suburbs, planned, communities, and, satellite, cities, suburbs, tend, to, proliferate, around, cities, that, have, an, abundance, of, adjacent, flat, land, the, english, word, is, derived, from, the, old, french, subburbe, which, is, in, turn, derived, from, the, latin, suburbium, formed, from, sub, meaning, under, or, below, and, urbs, city, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, in, english, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, appears, in, middle, english, c, 1350, in, the, manuscript, of, the, midlands, prose, psalter, in, which, the, form, suburbes, is, used, in, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, suburban, areas, in, the, wider, sense, noted, in, the, lead, paragraph, have, become, formalized, as, geographic, subdivisions, of, a, city, and, are, used, by, postal, services, in, addressing, in, rural, areas, in, both, countries, their, equivalents, are, called, localities, see, suburbs, and, localities, the, terms, inner, suburb, and, outer, suburb, are, used, to, differentiate, between, the, higher, density, areas, in, proximity, to, the, city, center, which, would, not, be, referred, to, as, suburbs, in, most, other, countries, and, the, lower, density, suburbs, on, the, outskirts, of, the, urban, area, the, term, middle, suburbs, is, also, used, inner, suburbs, such, as, te, aro, in, wellington, eden, terrace, in, auckland, prahran, in, melbourne, and, ultimo, in, sydney, are, usually, characterized, by, higher, density, apartment, housing, and, greater, integration, between, commercial, and, residential, areas, in, the, united, states, and, canada, suburb, can, refer, either, to, an, outlying, residential, area, of, a, city, or, town, or, to, a, separate, municipality, or, unincorporated, area, outside, a, town, or, city, although, a, majority, of, americans, regard, themselves, as, residents, of, suburban, communities, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, has, no, formal, definition, for, what, constitutes, a, suburb, in, the, united, states, leaving, its, precise, meaning, disputed, in, canada, the, term, may, also, be, used, in, the, british, sense, especially, as, cities, annex, formerly, outlying, areas, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, the, term, suburb, simply, refers, to, a, residential, area, outside, the, city, center, regardless, of, administrative, boundaries, suburbs, in, this, sense, can, range, from, areas, that, seem, more, like, residential, areas, of, a, city, proper, to, areas, separated, by, open, countryside, from, the, city, center, in, large, cities, such, as, london, and, leeds, many, suburbs, are, formerly, separate, towns, and, villages, that, have, been, absorbed, during, a, city, s, expansion, such, as, ealing, bromley, and, guiseley, in, ireland, this, can, be, seen, in, the, dublin, suburban, areas, of, swords, blanchardstown, and, tallaght, the, history, of, suburbia, is, part, of, the, study, of, urban, history, which, focuses, on, the, origins, growth, diverse, typologies, culture, and, politics, of, suburbs, as, well, as, on, the, gendered, and, family, oriented, nature, of, suburban, space, many, people, have, assumed, that, early, 20th, century, suburbs, were, enclaves, for, middle, class, whites, a, concept, that, carries, tremendous, cultural, influence, yet, is, actually, stereotypical, some, suburbs, are, based, on, a, society, of, working, class, and, minority, residents, many, of, whom, want, to, own, their, own, house, meanwhile, other, suburbs, instituted, explicitly, racist, policies, to, deter, people, deemed, as, other, a, practice, most, common, in, the, united, states, in, contrast, to, other, countries, around, the, world, mary, corbin, sies, argues, that, it, is, necessary, to, examine, how, suburb, is, defined, as, well, as, the, distinction, made, between, cities, and, suburbs, geography, economic, circumstances, and, the, interaction, of, numerous, factors, that, move, research, beyond, acceptance, of, stereotyping, and, its, influence, on, scholarly, assumptions, the, earliest, appearance, of, suburbs, coincided, with, the, spread, of, the, first, urban, settlements, large, walled, towns, tended, to, be, the, focus, around, which, smaller, villages, grew, up, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, market, town, the, word, suburbani, was, first, employed, by, the, roman, statesman, cicero, in, reference, to, the, large, villas, and, estates, built, by, the, wealthy, patricians, of, rome, on, the, city, s, outskirts, towards, the, end, of, the, eastern, han, dynasty, until, 190, ad, when, dong, zhuo, razed, the, city, the, capital, luoyang, was, mainly, occupied, by, the, emperor, and, important, officials, the, city, s, people, mostly, lived, in, small, cities, right, outside, luoyang, which, were, suburbs, in, all, but, name, as, populations, grew, during, the, early, modern, period, in, europe, towns, swelled, with, a, steady, influx, of, people, from, the, countryside, in, some, places, nearby, settlements, were, swallowed, up, as, the, main, city, expanded, the, peripheral, areas, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, were, generally, inhabited, by, the, very, poorest, due, to, the, rapid, migration, of, the, rural, poor, to, the, industrializing, cities, of, england, in, the, late, 18th, century, a, trend, in, the, opposite, direction, began, to, develop, whereby, newly, rich, members, of, the, middle, classes, began, to, purchase, estates, and, villas, on, the, outskirts, of, london, this, trend, accelerated, through, the, 19th, century, especially, in, cities, like, london, and, birmingham, that, were, growing, rapidly, and, the, first, suburban, districts, sprung, up, around, downtowns, to, accommodate, those, who, wanted, to, escape, the, squalid, conditions, of, the, industrial, towns, initially, such, growth, came, along, rail, lines, in, the, form, of, ribbon, developments, as, suburban, residents, could, commute, via, train, to, downtown, for, work, in, australia, where, melbourne, would, soon, become, the, second, largest, city, in, the, british, empire, the, distinctively, australasian, suburb, with, its, loosely, aggregated, quarter, acre, sections, developed, in, the, 1850s, and, eventually, became, a, component, of, the, australian, dream, toward, the, end, of, the, century, with, the, development, of, public, transit, systems, such, as, the, underground, railways, trams, and, buses, it, became, possible, for, the, majority, of, a, city, s, population, to, reside, outside, the, city, and, to, commute, into, the, center, for, work, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, first, major, suburban, areas, were, springing, up, around, london, as, the, city, then, the, largest, in, the, world, became, more, overcrowded, and, unsanitary, a, major, catalyst, for, suburban, growth, was, the, opening, of, the, metropolitan, railway, in, the, 1860s, the, line, later, joined, the, capital, s, financial, heart, in, the, city, to, what, were, to, become, the, suburbs, of, middlesex, the, line, reached, harrow, in, 1880, unlike, other, railway, companies, which, were, required, to, dispose, of, surplus, land, london, s, met, was, allowed, to, retain, such, land, that, it, believed, was, necessary, for, future, railway, use, initially, the, surplus, land, was, managed, by, the, land, committee, and, from, the, 1880s, the, land, was, developed, and, sold, to, domestic, buyers, in, places, like, willesden, park, estate, cecil, park, near, pinner, and, at, wembley, park, in, 1912, it, was, suggested, that, a, specially, formed, company, should, take, over, from, the, surplus, lands, committee, and, develop, suburban, estates, near, the, railway, however, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, delayed, these, plans, until, 1919, when, with, the, expectation, of, a, postwar, housing, boom, metropolitan, railway, country, estates, limited, mrce, formed, mrce, went, on, to, develop, estates, at, kingsbury, garden, village, near, neasden, wembley, park, cecil, park, and, grange, estate, at, pinner, and, the, cedars, estate, at, rickmansworth, and, to, found, places, such, as, harrow, garden, village, the, met, s, marketing, department, coined, the, term, metro, land, in, 1915, when, the, guide, to, the, extension, line, became, the, metro, land, guide, priced, at, 1, d, this, promoted, the, land, served, by, the, met, for, the, walker, visitor, and, later, the, house, hunter, published, annually, until, 1932, the, last, full, year, of, independence, for, the, met, the, guide, extolled, the, benefits, of, the, good, air, of, the, chilterns, using, language, such, as, each, lover, of, metroland, may, well, have, his, own, favorite, wood, beech, and, coppice, all, tremulous, green, loveliness, in, spring, and, russet, and, gold, in, october, the, dream, as, promoted, involved, a, modern, home, in, beautiful, countryside, with, a, fast, railway, service, to, central, london, by, 1915, people, from, across, london, had, flocked, to, live, the, new, suburban, dream, in, large, newly, built, areas, across, north, west, london, suburbanization, in, the, interwar, period, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, garden, city, movement, of, ebenezer, howard, and, the, creation, of, the, first, garden, suburbs, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, garden, suburb, was, developed, through, the, efforts, of, social, reformer, henrietta, barnett, and, her, husband, inspired, by, ebenezer, howard, and, the, model, housing, development, movement, then, exemplified, by, letchworth, garden, city, as, well, as, the, desire, to, protect, part, of, hampstead, heath, from, development, they, established, trusts, in, 1904, which, bought, 243, acres, of, land, along, the, newly, opened, northern, line, extension, to, golders, green, and, created, the, hampstead, garden, suburb, the, suburb, attracted, the, talents, of, architects, including, raymond, unwin, and, sir, edwin, lutyens, and, it, ultimately, grew, to, encompass, over, 800, acres, during, world, war, i, the, tudor, walters, committee, was, commissioned, to, make, recommendations, for, the, post, war, reconstruction, and, housebuilding, in, part, this, was, a, response, to, the, shocking, lack, of, fitness, amongst, many, recruits, during, world, war, one, attributed, to, poor, living, conditions, a, belief, summed, up, in, a, housing, poster, of, the, period, you, cannot, expect, to, get, an, a1, population, out, of, c3, homes, referring, to, military, fitness, classifications, of, the, period, the, committee, s, report, of, 1917, was, taken, up, by, the, government, which, passed, the, housing, town, planning, c, act, 1919, also, known, as, the, addison, act, after, christopher, addison, the, then, minister, for, housing, the, act, allowed, for, the, building, of, large, new, housing, estates, in, the, suburbs, after, the, first, world, war, and, marked, the, start, of, a, long, 20th, century, tradition, of, state, owned, housing, which, would, later, evolve, into, council, estates, the, report, also, legislated, on, the, required, minimum, standards, necessary, for, further, suburban, construction, this, included, regulation, on, the, maximum, housing, density, and, their, arrangement, and, it, even, made, recommendations, on, the, ideal, number, of, bedrooms, and, other, rooms, per, house, although, the, semi, detached, house, was, first, designed, by, the, shaws, a, father, and, son, architectural, partnership, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, during, the, suburban, housing, boom, of, the, interwar, period, that, the, design, first, proliferated, as, a, suburban, icon, being, preferred, by, middle, class, home, owners, to, the, smaller, terraced, houses, the, design, of, many, of, these, houses, highly, characteristic, of, the, era, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, art, deco, movement, taking, influence, from, tudor, revival, chalet, style, and, even, ship, design, within, just, a, decade, suburbs, dramatically, increased, in, size, harrow, weald, went, from, just, 1, 500, to, over, 10, 000, while, pinner, jumped, from, 3, 000, to, over, 20, 000, during, the, 1930s, over, 4, million, new, suburban, houses, were, built, the, suburban, revolution, had, made, england, the, most, heavily, suburbanized, country, in, the, world, by, a, considerable, margin, boston, and, new, york, city, spawned, the, first, major, suburbs, the, streetcar, lines, in, boston, and, the, rail, lines, in, manhattan, made, daily, commutes, possible, no, metropolitan, area, in, the, world, was, as, well, served, by, railroad, commuter, lines, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, as, new, york, and, it, was, the, rail, lines, to, westchester, from, the, grand, central, terminal, commuter, hub, that, enabled, its, development, westchester, s, true, importance, in, the, history, of, american, suburbanization, derives, from, the, upper, middle, class, development, of, villages, including, scarsdale, new, rochelle, and, rye, serving, thousands, of, businessmen, and, executives, from, manhattan, the, suburban, population, in, north, america, exploded, during, the, post, world, war, ii, economic, expansion, returning, veterans, wishing, to, start, a, settled, life, moved, in, masses, to, the, suburbs, levittown, developed, as, a, major, prototype, of, mass, produced, housing, due, to, the, influx, of, people, in, these, suburban, areas, the, amount, of, shopping, centers, began, to, increase, as, suburban, america, took, shape, these, malls, helped, supply, goods, and, services, to, the, growing, urban, population, shopping, for, different, goods, and, services, in, one, central, location, without, having, to, travel, to, multiple, locations, helped, to, keep, shopping, centers, a, component, of, these, newly, designed, suburbs, which, were, booming, in, population, the, television, helped, contribute, to, the, rise, of, shopping, centers, by, allowing, for, additional, advertisement, through, the, medium, in, addition, to, creating, a, desire, among, consumers, to, buy, products, that, are, shown, being, used, in, suburban, life, on, various, television, programs, another, factor, that, led, to, the, rise, of, these, shopping, centers, was, the, building, of, many, highways, the, highway, act, of, 1956, helped, to, fund, the, building, of, 64, 000, kilometers, across, the, nation, by, having, 26, billion, dollars, on, hand, which, helped, to, link, many, more, to, these, shopping, centers, with, ease, these, newly, built, shopping, centers, which, were, often, large, buildings, full, of, multiple, stores, and, services, were, being, used, for, more, than, shopping, but, as, a, place, of, leisure, and, a, meeting, point, for, those, who, lived, within, suburban, america, at, this, time, these, centers, thrived, offering, goods, and, services, to, the, growing, populations, in, suburban, america, in, 1957, 940, shopping, centers, were, built, and, this, number, more, than, doubled, by, 1960, to, keep, up, with, the, demand, of, these, densely, populated, areas, very, little, housing, had, been, built, during, the, great, depression, and, world, war, ii, except, for, emergency, quarters, near, war, industries, overcrowded, and, inadequate, apartments, was, the, common, condition, some, suburbs, had, developed, around, large, cities, where, there, was, rail, transportation, to, the, jobs, downtown, however, the, real, growth, in, suburbia, depended, on, the, availability, of, automobiles, highways, and, inexpensive, housing, the, population, had, grown, and, the, stock, of, family, savings, had, accumulated, the, money, for, down, payments, automobiles, and, appliances, the, product, was, a, great, housing, boom, whereas, an, average, of, 316, 000, new, non, farm, housing, units, were, constructed, from, the, 1930s, through, 1945, there, were, 1, 450, 000, constructed, annually, from, 1946, through, 1955, the, g, i, bill, guaranteed, low, cost, loans, for, veterans, with, very, low, down, payments, and, low, interest, rates, with, 16, million, eligible, veterans, the, opportunity, to, buy, a, house, was, suddenly, at, hand, in, 1947, alone, 540, 000, veterans, bought, one, their, average, price, was, 7300, the, construction, industry, kept, prices, low, by, standardization, for, example, standardizing, sizes, for, kitchen, cabinets, refrigerators, and, stoves, allowed, for, mass, production, of, kitchen, furnishings, developers, purchased, empty, land, just, outside, the, city, installed, tract, houses, based, on, a, handful, of, designs, and, provided, streets, and, utilities, while, local, public, officials, raced, to, build, schools, the, most, famous, development, was, levittown, in, long, island, just, east, of, new, york, city, it, offered, a, new, house, for, 1000, down, and, 70, a, month, it, featured, three, bedrooms, a, fireplace, a, gas, range, and, gas, furnace, and, a, landscaped, lot, of, 75, by, 100, feet, all, for, a, total, price, of, 10, 000, veterans, could, get, one, with, a, much, lower, down, payment, at, the, same, time, african, americans, were, rapidly, moving, north, and, west, for, better, jobs, and, educational, opportunities, than, were, available, to, them, in, the, segregated, south, their, arrival, in, northern, and, western, cities, en, masse, in, addition, to, being, followed, by, race, riots, in, several, large, cities, such, as, philadelphia, los, angeles, detroit, chicago, and, washington, d, c, further, stimulated, white, suburban, migration, the, growth, of, the, suburbs, was, facilitated, by, the, development, of, zoning, laws, redlining, and, numerous, innovations, in, transport, redlining, and, other, discriminatory, measures, built, into, federal, housing, policy, furthered, the, racial, segregation, of, postwar, america, for, example, by, refusing, to, insure, mortgages, in, and, near, african, american, neighborhoods, the, government, s, efforts, were, primarily, designed, to, provide, housing, to, white, middle, class, and, lower, middle, class, families, african, americans, and, other, people, of, color, largely, remained, concentrated, within, decaying, cores, of, urban, poverty, creating, a, phenomenon, known, as, white, flight, after, world, war, ii, the, availability, of, fha, loans, stimulated, a, housing, boom, in, american, suburbs, in, the, older, cities, of, the, northeast, u, s, streetcar, suburbs, originally, developed, along, train, or, trolley, lines, that, could, shuttle, workers, into, and, out, of, city, centers, where, the, jobs, were, located, this, practice, gave, rise, to, the, term, bedroom, community, meaning, that, most, daytime, business, activity, took, place, in, the, city, with, the, working, population, leaving, the, city, at, night, for, the, purpose, of, going, home, to, sleep, economic, growth, in, the, united, states, encouraged, the, suburbanization, of, american, cities, that, required, massive, investments, for, the, new, infrastructure, and, homes, consumer, patterns, were, also, shifting, at, this, time, as, purchasing, power, was, becoming, stronger, and, more, accessible, to, a, wider, range, of, families, suburban, houses, also, brought, about, needs, for, products, that, were, not, needed, in, urban, neighborhoods, such, as, lawnmowers, and, automobiles, during, this, time, commercial, shopping, malls, were, being, developed, near, suburbs, to, satisfy, consumers, needs, and, their, car, dependent, lifestyle, zoning, laws, also, contributed, to, the, location, of, residential, areas, outside, of, the, city, center, by, creating, wide, areas, or, zones, where, only, residential, buildings, were, permitted, these, suburban, residences, are, built, on, larger, lots, of, land, than, in, the, central, city, for, example, the, lot, size, for, a, residence, in, chicago, is, usually, 125, feet, 38, m, deep, while, the, width, can, vary, from, 14, feet, 4, 3, m, wide, for, a, row, house, to, 45, feet, 14, m, wide, for, a, large, stand, alone, house, in, the, suburbs, where, stand, alone, houses, are, the, rule, lots, may, be, 85, feet, 26, m, wide, by, 115, feet, 35, m, deep, as, in, the, chicago, suburb, of, naperville, manufacturing, and, commercial, buildings, were, segregated, in, other, areas, of, the, city, alongside, suburbanization, many, companies, began, locating, their, offices, and, other, facilities, in, the, outer, areas, of, the, cities, which, resulted, in, the, increased, density, of, older, suburbs, and, the, growth, of, lower, density, suburbs, even, further, from, city, centers, an, alternative, strategy, is, the, deliberate, design, of, new, towns, and, the, protection, of, green, belts, around, cities, some, social, reformers, attempted, to, combine, the, best, of, both, concepts, in, the, garden, city, movement, in, the, u, s, 1950, was, the, first, year, that, more, people, lived, in, suburbs, than, elsewhere, in, the, u, s, the, development, of, the, skyscraper, and, the, sharp, inflation, of, downtown, real, estate, prices, also, led, to, downtowns, being, more, fully, dedicated, to, businesses, thus, pushing, residents, outside, the, city, center, while, suburbs, are, often, associated, with, the, middle, classes, in, many, parts, of, the, developed, world, suburbs, can, be, economically, distressed, areas, inhabited, by, higher, proportions, of, recent, immigrants, with, higher, delinquency, rates, and, social, problems, reminiscent, of, the, inner, cities, of, the, u, s, examples, include, the, banlieues, of, france, or, the, concrete, suburbs, of, sweden, even, if, the, suburbs, of, these, countries, also, include, middle, class, and, upper, class, neighborhoods, that, often, consist, of, single, family, houses, following, the, growth, of, the, middle, class, due, to, african, industrialization, the, development, of, middle, class, suburbs, has, boomed, since, the, beginning, of, the, 1990s, particularly, in, cities, such, as, cairo, nairobi, johannesburg, and, lagos, in, an, illustrative, case, of, south, africa, rdp, housing, has, been, built, in, much, of, soweto, many, houses, are, american, in, appearance, but, are, smaller, and, often, consist, of, a, kitchen, and, living, room, two, or, three, bedrooms, and, a, bathroom, however, there, are, more, affluent, neighborhoods, more, comparable, to, american, suburbs, particularly, east, of, the, fnb, soccer, city, stadium, and, south, of, the, city, in, areas, like, eikenhof, where, the, eye, of, africa, planned, community, exists, this, master, planned, community, is, nearly, indistinguishable, from, the, most, amenity, rich, resort, style, american, suburbs, in, florida, arizona, and, california, complete, with, a, golf, course, resort, pool, equestrian, facility, 24, hour, staffed, gates, gym, and, bmx, track, as, well, as, several, tennis, basketball, and, volleyball, courts, in, cape, town, there, is, a, distinct, european, style, originating, from, european, influence, during, the, mid, 1600s, when, the, dutch, settled, the, cape, houses, like, these, are, called, cape, dutch, houses, and, can, be, found, in, the, affluent, suburbs, of, constantia, and, bishopscourt, large, cities, like, sydney, and, melbourne, had, streetcar, suburbs, in, the, tram, era, with, the, automobile, the, australian, usage, came, about, as, outer, areas, were, quickly, surrounded, in, fast, growing, cities, but, retained, the, appellation, suburb, the, term, was, eventually, applied, to, neighborhoods, in, the, original, core, as, well, in, australia, sydney, s, urban, sprawl, has, occurred, predominantly, in, the, western, suburbs, the, locality, of, olympic, park, was, designated, an, official, suburb, in, 2009, bangladesh, has, multiple, suburbs, uttara, ashulia, to, name, a, few, however, most, suburbs, in, dhaka, are, different, from, the, ones, in, europe, americas, most, suburbs, in, bangladesh, are, filled, with, high, rise, buildings, paddy, fields, and, farms, and, are, designed, more, like, rural, villages, canada, is, an, urbanized, nation, where, over, 80, of, the, population, lives, in, urban, areas, loosely, defined, and, roughly, two, thirds, live, in, one, of, canada, s, 33, census, metropolitan, areas, cmas, with, a, population, of, over, 100, 000, however, of, this, metropolitan, population, in, 2001, nearly, half, lived, in, low, density, neighborhoods, with, only, one, in, five, living, in, a, typical, urban, neighborhood, the, percentage, living, in, low, density, neighborhoods, varied, from, a, high, of, nearly, two, thirds, of, calgary, cma, residents, 67, to, a, low, of, about, one, third, of, montr, al, cma, residents, 34, large, cities, in, canada, acquired, streetcar, suburbs, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, modern, canadian, suburbs, tend, to, be, less, automobile, centric, than, those, in, the, united, states, and, public, transit, use, is, encouraged, but, can, be, notably, unused, throughout, canada, there, are, comprehensive, plans, in, place, to, curb, sprawl, population, and, income, growth, in, canadian, suburbs, had, tended, to, outpace, growth, in, core, urban, or, rural, areas, but, in, many, areas, this, trend, has, now, reversed, the, suburban, population, increased, by, 87, between, 1981, and, 2001, well, ahead, of, urban, growth, the, majority, of, recent, population, growth, in, canada, s, three, largest, metropolitan, areas, greater, toronto, greater, montr, al, and, greater, vancouver, has, occurred, in, non, core, municipalities, this, trend, is, also, beginning, to, take, effect, in, vancouver, and, to, a, lesser, extent, montr, al, in, certain, cities, particularly, edmonton, and, calgary, suburban, growth, takes, place, within, the, city, boundaries, as, opposed, to, in, bedroom, communities, this, is, due, to, annexation, and, a, large, geographic, footprint, within, the, city, borders, calgary, is, unusual, among, canadian, cities, because, it, has, developed, as, a, unicity, it, has, annexed, most, of, its, surrounding, towns, and, large, amounts, of, undeveloped, land, around, the, city, as, a, result, most, of, the, communities, that, calgarians, refer, to, as, suburbs, are, actually, inside, the, city, limits, in, the, 2016, census, the, city, of, calgary, had, a, population, of, 1, 239, 220, whereas, the, calgary, metropolitan, area, had, a, population, of, 1, 392, 609, indicating, the, vast, majority, of, people, in, the, calgary, cma, lived, within, the, city, limits, the, perceived, low, population, density, of, calgary, largely, results, from, its, many, internal, suburbs, and, the, large, amount, of, undeveloped, land, within, the, city, the, city, actually, has, a, policy, of, densifying, its, new, developments, in, china, the, term, suburb, is, new, although, suburbs, are, already, being, constructed, rapidly, chinese, suburbs, mostly, consist, of, rows, upon, rows, of, apartment, blocks, and, condos, that, end, abruptly, into, the, countryside, also, new, town, developments, are, extremely, common, single, family, suburban, homes, tend, to, be, similar, to, their, western, equivalents, although, primarily, outside, beijing, and, shanghai, also, mimic, spanish, and, italian, architecture, in, hong, kong, however, suburbs, are, mostly, government, planned, new, towns, containing, numerous, public, housing, estates, however, other, new, towns, also, contain, private, housing, estates, and, low, density, developments, for, the, upper, classes, in, the, illustrative, case, of, rome, italy, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, suburbs, were, intentionally, created, ex, novo, to, give, lower, classes, a, destination, in, consideration, of, the, actual, and, foreseen, massive, arrival, of, poor, people, from, other, areas, of, the, country, many, critics, have, seen, in, this, development, pattern, which, was, circularly, distributed, in, every, direction, also, a, quick, solution, to, a, problem, of, public, order, keeping, the, unwelcome, poorest, classes, together, with, the, criminals, in, this, way, better, controlled, comfortably, remote, from, the, elegant, official, town, on, the, other, hand, the, expected, huge, expansion, of, the, town, soon, effectively, covered, the, distance, from, the, central, town, and, now, those, suburbs, are, completely, engulfed, by, the, main, territory, of, the, town, other, newer, suburbs, called, exurbs, were, created, at, a, further, distance, from, them, in, japan, the, construction, of, suburbs, has, boomed, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, many, cities, are, experiencing, the, urban, sprawl, effect, in, mexico, suburbs, are, generally, similar, to, their, united, states, counterparts, houses, are, made, in, many, different, architectural, styles, which, may, be, of, european, american, and, international, architecture, and, which, vary, in, size, suburbs, can, be, found, in, guadalajara, mexico, city, monterrey, and, most, major, cities, lomas, de, chapultepec, is, an, example, of, an, affluent, suburb, although, it, is, located, inside, the, city, and, by, no, means, is, today, a, suburb, in, the, strict, sense, of, the, word, in, other, countries, the, situation, is, similar, to, that, of, mexico, with, many, suburbs, being, built, most, notably, in, peru, and, chile, which, have, experienced, a, boom, in, the, construction, of, suburbs, since, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, as, the, growth, of, middle, class, and, upper, class, suburbs, increased, low, class, squatter, areas, have, increased, most, notably, lost, cities, in, mexico, campamentos, in, chile, barriadas, in, peru, villa, miserias, in, argentina, asentamientos, in, guatemala, and, favelas, of, brazil, brazilian, affluent, suburbs, are, generally, denser, more, vertical, and, mixed, in, use, inner, suburbs, they, concentrate, infrastructure, investment, and, attention, from, the, municipal, seat, and, the, best, offer, of, mass, transit, true, sprawling, towards, neighboring, municipalities, is, typically, empoverished, periferia, the, periphery, in, the, sense, of, it, dealing, with, spatial, marginalization, with, a, very, noticeable, example, being, the, rail, suburbs, of, rio, de, janeiro, the, north, zone, the, baixada, fluminense, the, part, of, the, west, zone, associated, with, supervia, s, ramal, de, santa, cruz, these, in, comparison, with, the, inner, suburbs, often, prove, to, be, remote, violent, food, deserts, with, inadequate, sewer, structure, coverage, saturated, mass, transit, more, precarious, running, water, electricity, and, communication, services, and, lack, of, urban, planning, and, landscaping, while, also, not, necessarily, qualifying, as, actual, favelas, or, slums, they, often, are, former, agricultural, land, or, wild, areas, settled, through, squatting, suburbs, grew, and, expanded, due, to, the, mass, rural, exodus, during, the, years, of, the, military, dictatorship, this, is, particularly, true, of, s, o, paulo, rio, de, janeiro, and, bras, lia, which, grew, with, migration, from, more, distant, and, impoverished, parts, of, the, country, and, deal, with, overpopulation, as, a, result, in, malaysia, suburbs, are, common, especially, in, klang, valley, the, largest, conurbation, in, the, country, these, suburbs, also, serve, as, major, housing, areas, and, commuter, towns, terraced, houses, semi, detached, houses, and, shophouses, are, common, concepts, in, suburban, planning, in, certain, places, such, as, klang, subang, jaya, and, petaling, jaya, suburbs, form, the, core, the, latter, one, has, been, turned, into, a, satellite, city, of, kuala, lumpur, suburbs, are, also, evident, in, other, major, conurbations, in, the, country, such, as, penang, island, butterworth, bukit, mertajam, johor, bahru, skudai, pasir, gudang, ipoh, simpang, pulai, kota, melaka, ayer, keroh, kuching, petra, jaya, and, alor, setar, anak, bukit, in, russia, until, recently, the, term, suburb, refers, to, high, rise, residential, apartments, which, usually, consist, of, two, bedrooms, one, bathroom, a, kitchen, and, a, living, room, however, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, in, russia, there, has, been, a, cottage, boom, as, a, result, of, which, a, huge, number, of, cottage, villages, appeared, in, almost, every, city, of, the, country, including, moscow, no, different, from, the, suburbs, in, western, countries, in, the, united, kingdom, suburbs, are, located, between, the, exurbs, and, inner, cities, of, a, metropolitan, area, the, growth, in, the, use, of, trains, and, later, cars, and, highways, increased, the, ease, with, which, workers, could, have, a, job, in, the, city, while, commuting, in, from, the, suburbs, in, the, united, kingdom, as, mentioned, above, railways, stimulated, the, first, mass, exodus, to, the, suburbs, the, metropolitan, railway, for, example, was, active, in, building, and, promoting, its, own, housing, estates, in, the, north, west, of, london, consisting, mostly, of, detached, houses, on, large, plots, which, it, then, marketed, as, metro, land, in, the, uk, the, government, is, seeking, to, impose, minimum, densities, on, newly, approved, housing, schemes, in, parts, of, south, east, england, the, goal, is, to, build, sustainable, communities, rather, than, housing, estates, however, commercial, concerns, tend, to, delay, the, opening, of, services, until, a, large, number, of, residents, have, occupied, the, new, neighborhood, many, white, people, moved, to, the, suburbs, during, the, white, flight, in, the, 19th, century, horse, drawn, and, later, electric, trolleys, enabled, the, creation, of, streetcar, suburbs, which, expanded, the, area, in, which, city, commuters, could, live, these, are, typically, medium, density, neighborhoods, contiguous, with, the, core, urban, area, built, for, pedestrian, access, to, the, streetcar, lines, with, widespread, adoption, of, the, automobile, progressing, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1950s, and, especially, with, the, introduction, of, the, interstate, highway, system, new, suburbs, were, designed, around, car, transport, instead, of, pedestrians, over, time, many, suburban, areas, especially, those, not, within, the, political, boundaries, of, the, city, containing, the, central, business, area, began, to, see, independence, from, the, central, city, as, an, asset, in, some, cases, suburbanites, saw, self, government, as, a, means, to, keep, out, people, who, could, not, afford, the, added, suburban, property, maintenance, costs, not, needed, in, city, living, federal, subsidies, for, suburban, development, accelerated, this, process, as, did, the, practice, of, redlining, by, banks, and, other, lending, institutions, in, some, cities, such, as, miami, san, francisco, and, washington, d, c, the, main, city, is, much, smaller, than, the, surrounding, suburban, areas, leaving, the, city, proper, with, a, small, portion, of, the, metro, area, s, population, and, land, area, mesa, arizona, and, virginia, beach, virginia, the, two, most, populous, suburbs, in, the, u, s, are, actually, more, populous, than, many, core, cities, including, miami, minneapolis, new, orleans, cleveland, tampa, st, louis, pittsburgh, cincinnati, and, others, virginia, beach, is, now, the, most, populous, city, in, virginia, having, long, since, exceeded, the, population, of, its, neighboring, primary, city, norfolk, while, virginia, beach, has, slowly, been, taking, on, the, characteristics, of, an, urban, city, it, will, not, likely, achieve, the, population, density, and, urban, characteristics, of, norfolk, a, second, suburban, city, in, virginia, chesapeake, has, also, exceeded, the, population, of, adjacent, norfolk, with, only, a, few, large, commercial, areas, and, no, definitive, downtown, area, chesapeake, is, primarily, residential, in, nature, with, vast, rural, areas, remaining, within, the, city, limits, cleveland, ohio, is, typical, of, many, american, central, cities, its, municipal, borders, have, changed, little, since, 1922, even, though, the, cleveland, urbanized, area, has, grown, many, times, over, several, layers, of, suburban, municipalities, now, surround, cities, like, boston, cleveland, chicago, detroit, los, angeles, dallas, denver, houston, new, york, city, san, francisco, sacramento, atlanta, miami, baltimore, milwaukee, pittsburgh, philadelphia, phoenix, norfolk, st, louis, salt, lake, city, las, vegas, minneapolis, and, washington, d, c, suburbs, in, the, united, states, have, a, prevalence, of, usually, detached, single, family, homes, they, are, characterized, by, by, 2010, suburbs, increasingly, gained, people, in, racial, minority, groups, as, many, members, of, minority, groups, gained, better, access, to, education, and, sought, more, favorable, living, conditions, compared, to, inner, city, areas, conversely, many, white, americans, also, moved, back, to, city, centers, nearly, all, major, city, downtowns, such, as, downtown, miami, downtown, detroit, downtown, philadelphia, downtown, roanoke, or, downtown, los, angeles, are, experiencing, a, renewal, with, large, population, growth, residential, apartment, construction, and, increased, social, cultural, and, infrastructural, investments, as, have, suburban, neighborhoods, close, to, city, centers, better, public, transit, proximity, to, work, and, cultural, attractions, and, frustration, with, suburban, life, and, gridlock, have, attracted, young, americans, to, the, city, centers, the, hispanic, and, asian, population, is, increasing, in, the, suburbs, suburbs, typically, have, longer, travel, times, to, work, than, traditional, neighborhoods, only, the, traffic, within, the, short, streets, themselves, is, less, this, is, due, to, three, factors, almost, mandatory, automobile, ownership, due, to, poor, suburban, bus, systems, and, nearly, nonexistent, rail, systems, longer, travel, distances, and, the, hierarchy, system, which, is, less, efficient, at, distributing, traffic, than, the, traditional, grid, of, streets, in, the, suburban, system, most, trips, from, one, component, to, another, component, requires, that, cars, enter, a, collector, road, no, matter, how, short, or, long, the, distance, is, this, is, compounded, by, the, hierarchy, of, streets, where, entire, neighborhoods, and, subdivisions, are, dependent, on, one, or, two, collector, roads, because, all, traffic, is, forced, onto, these, roads, they, are, often, heavy, with, traffic, all, day, if, a, traffic, crash, occurs, on, a, collector, road, or, if, road, construction, inhibits, the, flow, then, the, entire, road, system, may, be, rendered, useless, until, the, blockage, is, cleared, the, traditional, grown, grid, in, turn, allows, for, a, larger, number, of, choices, and, alternate, routes, suburban, systems, of, the, sprawl, type, are, also, quite, inefficient, for, cyclists, or, pedestrians, as, the, direct, route, is, usually, not, available, for, them, either, this, encourages, car, trips, even, for, distances, as, low, as, several, hundreds, of, yards, or, meters, which, may, have, become, up, to, several, miles, or, kilometers, due, to, the, road, network, improved, sprawl, systems, though, retaining, the, car, detours, possess, cycle, paths, and, footpaths, connecting, across, the, arms, of, the, sprawl, system, allowing, a, more, direct, route, while, still, keeping, the, cars, out, of, the, residential, and, side, streets, more, commonly, central, cities, seek, ways, to, tax, nonresidents, working, downtown, known, as, commuter, taxes, as, property, tax, bases, dwindle, taken, together, these, two, groups, of, taxpayers, represent, a, largely, untapped, source, of, potential, revenue, that, cities, may, begin, to, target, more, aggressively, particularly, if, they, re, struggling, according, to, struggling, cities, this, will, help, bring, in, a, substantial, revenue, for, the, city, which, is, a, great, way, to, tax, the, people, who, make, the, most, use, of, the, highways, and, repairs, today, more, companies, settle, down, in, suburbs, because, of, low, property, costs, suburbs, and, suburban, living, have, been, the, subject, for, a, wide, variety, of, films, books, television, shows, and, songs, french, songs, like, la, zone, by, fr, hel, 1933, aux, quatre, coins, de, la, banlieue, by, damia, 1936, ma, banlieue, by, reda, caire, 1937, or, banlieue, by, robert, lamoureux, 1953, evoke, the, suburbs, of, paris, explicitly, since, the, 1930s, those, singers, give, a, sunny, festive, almost, bucolic, image, of, the, suburbs, yet, still, few, urbanized, during, the, fifties, and, the, sixties, french, singer, songwriter, l, o, ferr, evokes, in, his, songs, popular, and, proletarian, suburbs, of, paris, to, oppose, them, to, the, city, considered, by, comparison, as, a, bourgeois, and, conservative, place, french, cinema, was, although, soon, interested, in, urban, changes, in, the, suburbs, with, such, movies, as, mon, oncle, by, jacques, tati, 1958, l, amour, existe, by, maurice, pialat, 1961, or, two, or, three, things, i, know, about, her, by, jean, luc, godard, 1967, in, his, one, act, opera, trouble, in, tahiti, 1952, leonard, bernstein, skewers, american, suburbia, which, produces, misery, instead, of, happiness, the, american, photojournalist, bill, owens, documented, the, culture, of, suburbia, in, the, 1970s, most, notably, in, his, book, suburbia, the, 1962, song, little, boxes, by, malvina, reynolds, lampoons, the, development, of, suburbia, and, its, perceived, bourgeois, and, conformist, values, while, the, 1982, song, subdivisions, by, the, canadian, band, rush, also, discusses, suburbia, as, does, rockin, the, suburbs, by, ben, folds, the, 2010, album, the, suburbs, by, the, canadian, based, alternative, band, arcade, fire, dealt, with, aspects, of, growing, up, in, suburbia, suggesting, aimlessness, apathy, and, endless, rushing, are, ingrained, into, the, suburban, culture, and, mentality, suburb, the, musical, was, written, by, robert, s, cohen, and, david, javerbaum, over, the, hedge, is, a, syndicated, comic, strip, written, and, drawn, by, michael, fry, and, t, lewis, it, tells, the, story, of, a, raccoon, turtle, a, squirrel, and, their, friends, who, come, to, terms, with, their, woodlands, being, taken, over, by, suburbia, trying, to, survive, the, increasing, flow, of, humanity, and, technology, while, becoming, enticed, by, it, at, the, same, time, a, film, adaptation, of, over, the, hedge, was, produced, in, 2006, british, television, series, such, as, the, good, life, butterflies, and, the, fall, and, rise, of, reginald, perrin, have, depicted, suburbia, as, well, manicured, but, relentlessly, boring, and, its, residents, as, either, overly, conforming, or, prone, to, going, stir, crazy, in, contrast, u, s, shows, such, as, knots, landing, desperate, housewives, and, weeds, portray, the, suburbs, as, concealing, darker, secrets, behind, a, fa, ade, of, manicured, lawns, friendly, people, and, beautifully, kept, houses, films, such, as, the, burbs, and, disturbia, have, brought, this, theme, to, the, cinema
