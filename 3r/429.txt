lakes, coast, and, the, cumbrian, mountains, and, for, its, literary, associations, with, beatrix, potter, john, ruskin, and, the, lake, poets, the, cumbrian, mountains, or, fells, include, england, s, highest, scafell, pike, 978, m, 3, 209, ft, helvellyn, 950, m, 3, 120, ft, and, skiddaw, 931, m, 3, 054, ft, the, region, also, contains, sixteen, major, lakes, they, include, windermere, which, with, a, length, of, 11, miles, 18, km, and, an, area, of, 5, 69, square, miles, 14, 73, km, 2, is, the, longest, and, largest, lake, in, england, and, wast, water, which, at, 79, metres, 259, ft, is, the, deepest, lake, in, england, the, lake, district, national, park, was, established, in, 1951, and, covers, an, area, of, 2, 362, km, 2, 912, square, miles, the, bulk, of, the, region, it, was, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2017, the, lake, district, national, park, includes, all, of, the, central, lake, district, though, the, town, of, kendal, some, coastal, areas, and, the, cartmel, and, furness, peninsulas, are, outside, the, park, boundary, the, area, was, designated, a, national, park, on, 9, may, 1951, a, month, after, the, peak, district, the, first, uk, national, park, it, retained, its, original, boundaries, until, 2016, when, it, was, extended, by, 3, to, the, east, in, the, direction, of, the, yorkshire, dales, national, park, to, incorporate, areas, land, of, high, landscape, value, around, the, lune, valley, the, national, park, received, 18, 14, million, tourist, visitors, in, 2022, this, equates, to, 29, 15, million, tourist, days, counting, visits, of, greater, than, three, hours, it, is, the, largest, of, the, thirteen, national, parks, in, england, and, wales, and, the, second, largest, in, the, uk, after, the, cairngorms, national, park, its, aim, is, to, protect, the, landscape, by, restricting, unwelcome, change, by, industry, or, commerce, the, area, of, the, national, park, with, the, exception, of, the, 2016, extension, was, designated, a, world, heritage, site, in, 2017, as, a, cultural, landscape, this, was, the, fourth, attempt, to, list, the, park, after, two, attempts, in, the, 1980s, and, one, in, 2012, failed, the, park, is, governed, by, the, lake, district, national, park, authority, which, is, based, at, offices, in, kendal, it, runs, a, visitor, centre, on, windermere, at, a, former, country, house, called, brockhole, coniston, boating, centre, and, information, centres, the, park, authority, has, 20, members, six, appointed, by, westmorland, and, furness, council, four, by, cumberland, council, and, ten, by, the, secretary, of, state, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, the, precise, extent, of, the, lake, district, is, undefined, but, it, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, slightly, larger, than, that, of, the, national, park, whose, total, area, is, about, 2, 362, square, kilometres, 912, sq, mi, the, park, extends, just, over, 51, kilometres, 32, mi, from, east, to, west, and, nearly, 64, kilometres, 40, mi, from, north, to, south, with, areas, such, as, the, lake, district, peninsulas, to, the, south, lying, outside, the, national, park, there, are, only, a, few, major, settlements, within, this, mountainous, area, the, towns, of, keswick, windermere, and, bowness, on, windermere, which, are, contiguous, and, ambleside, are, the, three, largest, the, economies, of, all, these, are, heavily, dependent, on, tourism, significant, settlements, close, to, the, boundary, of, the, national, park, include, carlisle, barrow, in, furness, kendal, ulverston, dalton, in, furness, whitehaven, workington, cockermouth, penrith, millom, and, grange, over, sands, each, of, these, has, important, economic, links, with, the, area, other, villages, are, coniston, threlkeld, glenridding, pooley, bridge, broughton, in, furness, grasmere, newby, bridge, staveley, lindale, gosforth, and, hawkshead, beyond, these, are, a, scattering, of, hamlets, and, many, isolated, farmsteads, some, of, which, are, still, tied, to, agriculture, others, now, function, as, part, of, the, tourist, economy, the, lake, district, is, very, nearly, contained, within, a, box, of, trunk, routes, and, major, a, roads, it, is, flanked, to, the, east, by, the, a6, road, which, runs, from, kendal, to, penrith, though, the, national, park, extension, approved, in, 2015, is, east, of, the, a6, across, its, southern, fringes, by, the, a590, which, connects, the, m6, to, barrow, in, furness, and, the, a5092, and, across, its, northern, edge, by, the, a66, trunk, road, between, penrith, and, workington, the, a595, linking, the, a66, with, the, a5092, forms, the, park, boundary, from, calder, bridge, to, holmrook, then, crosses, the, coastal, plain, of, the, park, until, turning, inland, at, the, whicham, valley, forming, much, of, the, park, boundary, again, until, joining, the, a5092, at, grizebeck, besides, these, a, few, a, roads, penetrate, the, area, itself, notably, the, a591, which, runs, north, westwards, from, kendal, to, windermere, and, then, on, to, keswick, it, continues, up, the, east, side, of, bassenthwaite, lake, the, a591, grasmere, lake, district, was, short, listed, in, the, 2011, google, street, view, awards, in, the, most, romantic, street, category, the, a593, and, a5084, link, the, ambleside, and, coniston, areas, with, the, a590, to, the, south, whilst, the, a592, and, a5074, similarly, link, windermere, with, the, a590, the, a592, also, continues, northwards, from, windermere, to, ullswater, and, penrith, by, way, of, the, kirkstone, pass, some, valleys, which, are, not, penetrated, by, a, roads, are, served, by, b, roads, the, b5289, serves, lorton, vale, and, buttermere, and, links, via, the, honister, pass, with, borrowdale, the, b5292, ascends, the, whinlatter, pass, from, lorton, vale, before, dropping, down, to, braithwaite, near, keswick, the, b5322, serves, the, valley, of, st, john, s, in, the, vale, whilst, great, langdale, is, served, by, the, b5343, other, valleys, such, as, little, langdale, eskdale, and, dunnerdale, are, served, by, minor, roads, the, last, of, these, is, connected, with, the, first, two, by, the, wrynose, and, hardknott, passes, respectively, both, of, these, passes, are, known, for, their, steep, gradients, and, are, together, one, of, the, most, popular, climbs, in, the, united, kingdom, for, cycling, enthusiasts, a, minor, road, through, the, newlands, valley, connects, via, newlands, hause, with, the, b5289, at, buttermere, wasdale, is, served, by, a, cul, de, sac, minor, road, as, is, longsleddale, and, the, valleys, at, haweswater, and, kentmere, there, are, networks, of, minor, roads, in, the, lower, lying, southern, part, of, the, area, connecting, numerous, communities, between, kendal, windermere, and, coniston, the, west, coast, main, line, skirts, the, eastern, edge, of, the, lake, district, and, the, cumbrian, coast, line, passes, through, the, southern, and, western, fringes, of, the, area, a, single, railway, line, the, windermere, branch, line, penetrates, from, kendal, to, windermere, via, staveley, railways, once, served, broughton, in, furness, and, coniston, closed, to, passengers, in, 1958, and, another, ran, from, penrith, to, cockermouth, via, keswick, closed, west, of, keswick, in, 1966, and, completely, in, 1972, part, of, the, track, of, the, latter, is, used, by, the, improved, a66, trunk, road, the, cumbrian, coast, line, has, three, stations, within, the, boundaries, of, the, national, park, and, additionally, drigg, about, a, third, of, a, mile, from, the, park, boundary, the, line, gives, railway, enthusiasts, and, others, a, flavour, of, a, pre, beeching, railway, line, with, features, like, manually, operated, level, crossing, gates, as, well, as, giving, a, good, connection, to, the, steam, railway, into, eskdale, and, providing, access, for, cyclists, and, serious, walkers, to, the, western, fells, the, narrow, gauge, ravenglass, and, eskdale, railway, runs, from, ravenglass, on, the, west, coast, up, eskdale, as, far, as, dalegarth, station, near, the, hamlet, of, boot, catering, for, tourists, another, heritage, railway, the, lakeside, and, haverthwaite, railway, runs, between, lake, windermere, and, haverthwaite, and, tourists, can, connect, at, lakeside, with, the, boats, up, the, lake, to, bowness, a, vehicle, carrying, cable, ferry, the, windermere, ferry, runs, frequent, services, across, windermere, there, are, also, seasonal, passenger, boats, on, coniston, water, derwent, water, and, ullswater, there, are, many, paths, over, which, the, public, has, a, right, of, way, all, of, which, are, signposted, at, their, origin, on, public, roads, and, at, some, other, points, within, the, area, of, the, national, park, in, 2012, there, were, 2, 159, km, 1, 342, mi, of, public, footpaths, 875, km, 544, mi, of, public, bridleways, 15, km, 9, mi, of, restricted, byways, and, 30, km, 19, mi, of, byways, open, to, all, traffic, there, is, also, a, general, right, to, roam, in, open, country, which, includes, approximately, 50, of, the, national, park, many, of, these, tracks, arose, centuries, ago, and, were, used, either, as, ridge, highways, such, as, along, high, street, or, as, passes, for, travelling, across, the, ridges, between, settlements, in, the, valleys, historically, these, paths, were, not, planned, for, reaching, summits, but, more, recently, they, are, used, by, fell, walkers, for, that, purpose, the, coast,

circular, upland, massif, deeply, dissected, by, a, broadly, radial, pattern, of, major, valleys, which, are, largely, the, result, of, repeated, glaciations, over, the, last, 2, million, years, the, apparent, radial, pattern, is, not, from, a, central, dome, but, from, an, axial, watershed, extending, from, st, bees, head, in, the, west, to, shap, in, the, east, most, of, these, valleys, display, the, u, shaped, cross, section, characteristic, of, glacial, origin, and, often, contain, long, narrow, lakes, in, bedrock, hollows, with, tracts, of, relatively, flat, ground, at, their, infilled, heads, or, where, they, are, divided, by, lateral, tributaries, buttermere, crummock, water, derwent, water, bassenthwaite, lake, smaller, lakes, known, as, tarns, occupy, glacial, cirques, at, higher, elevations, it, is, the, abundance, of, both, which, has, led, to, the, area, becoming, known, as, the, lake, district, many, of, the, higher, fells, are, rocky, while, moorland, predominates,

southwestern, lake, district, ends, near, the, furness, peninsula, and, barrow, in, furness, a, town, which, many, lake, district, residents, rely, on, for, basic, amenities, the, southeastern, area, is, the, territory, between, coniston, water, and, windermere, and, east, of, windermere, towards, kendal, and, south, to, lindale, there, are, no, high, summits, in, this, area, which, are, mainly, low, hills, knolls, and, limestone, cuestas, such, as, gummer, s, how, and, whitbarrow, indeed, it, rises, only, as, high, as, 333, m, 1, 093, ft, at, top, o, selside, east, of, coniston, water, the,

mountains, up, into, blocks, which, have, been, described, by, various, authors, in, different, ways, the, most, frequently, encountered, approach, is, that, made, popular, by, alfred, wainwright, who, published, seven, separate, area, guides, to, the, lakeland, fells, only, one, of, the, lakes, in, the, lake, district, is, called, by, that, name, bassenthwaite, lake, all, the, others, such, as, windermere, coniston, water, ullswater, and, buttermere, are, meres, tarns, and, waters, with, mere, being, the, least, common, and, water, being, the, most, common, the, major, lakes, and, reservoirs, in, the, national, park, are, given, below, below, the, tree, line, are, wooded, areas, including, british, and, european, native, oak, woodlands, and, introduced, softwood, plantations, the, woodlands, provide, habitats, for, native, english, wildlife, the, native, red, squirrel, is, found, in, the, lake, district, and, a, few, other, parts, of, england, in, parts, of, the, lake, district, the, rainfall, is, higher, than, in, any, other, part, of, england, this, gives, atlantic, mosses, ferns, lichen, and, liverworts, the, chance, to, grow, there, is, some, ancient, woodland, in, the, national, park, management, of, the, woodlands, varies, some, are, coppiced, some, pollarded, some, left, to, grow, naturally, and, some, provide, grazing, and, shelter, the, lake, district, extends, to, the, coast, of, the, irish, sea, from, drigg, in, the, north, to, silecroft, in, the, south, encompassing, the, estuaries, of, the, esk, and, its, tributaries, the, irt, and, the, mite, the, intertidal, zone, of, the, combined, estuaries, includes, sand, shingle, and, mudflats, and, saltmarsh, the, dune, systems, on, either, side, of, the, estuary, are, protected, as, nature, reserves, drigg, dunes, and, gullery, to, the, north, and, eskmeals, dunes, to, the, south, south, of, the, estuary, the, coast, is, formed, in, low, cliffs, of, glacial, till, sands, and, gravels, the, district, also, extends, to, the, tidal, waters, of, morecambe, bay, and, several, of, its, estuaries, alongside, the, furness, and, cartmel, peninsulas, designated, on, m6, motorway, signposts, as, the, lake, district, peninsulas, and, the, southern, portions, of, which, lie, outside, the, park, these, are, the, duddon, estuary, the, leven, estuary, and, the, western, banks, and, tidal, flats, of, the, kent, estuary, these, areas, are, each, characterised, by, sand, and, mudflats, of, scenic, and, wildlife, interest, the, coast, is, backed, by, extensive, flats, of, raised, marine, deposits, left, when, the, relative, sea, level, was, higher, the, lake, district, s, geology, is, very, complex, but, well, studied, a, granite, batholith, beneath, the, area, is, responsible, for, this, upland, massif, its, relatively, low, density, causing, the, area, to, be, buoyed, up, the, granite, can, be, seen, at, the, surface, as, the, ennerdale, skiddaw, carrock, fell, eskdale, and, shap, granites, broadly, speaking, the, area, can, be, divided, into, three, bands, divisions, which, run, southwest, to, the, northeast, generally, speaking, the, rocks, become, younger, from, the, northwest, to, the, southeast, the, northwestern, band, is, composed, of, early, to, mid, ordovician, sedimentary, rocks, largely, mudstones, and, siltstones, of, marine, origin, together, they, comprise, the, skiddaw, group, and, include, the, rocks, traditionally, known, as, the, skiddaw, slates, their, friability, generally, leads, to, mountains, with, relatively, smooth, slopes, such, as, skiddaw, itself, the, central, band, is, a, mix, of, volcanic, and, sedimentary, rocks, of, mid, to, late, ordovician, age, comprising, the, lavas, and, tuffs, of, the, borrowdale, volcanic, group, erupted, as, the, former, iapetus, ocean, was, subducted, beneath, what, is, now, the, scottish, border, during, the, caledonian, orogeny, the, northern, central, peaks, such, as, great, rigg, were, produced, by, considerable, lava, flows, these, lava, eruptions, were, followed, by, a, series, of, pyroclastic, eruptions, which, produced, a, series, of, calderas, one, of, which, includes, present, day, scafell, pike, these, pyroclastic, rocks, give, rise, to, the, craggy, landscapes, typical, of, the, central, fells, the, southeastern, band, comprises, the, mudstones, and, wackes, of, the, windermere, supergroup, and, which, includes, successively, the, rocks, of, the, dent, stockdale, tranearth, coniston, and, kendal, groups, these, are, generally, a, little, less, resistant, to, erosion, than, the, sequence, of, the, rock, to, the, north, and, underlie, much, of, the, lower, landscapes, around, coniston, and, windermere, later, intrusions, have, formed, individual, outcrops,

generally, very, windy, the, coastal, areas, have, 20, days, of, gales, and, the, fell, tops, around, 100, days, of, gales, per, year, the, maritime, climate, means, that, the, lake, district, has, relatively, moderate, temperature, variations, throughout, the, year, the, mean, temperature, in, the, valleys, ranges, from, about, 3, c, 37, f, in, january, to, around, 15, c, 59, f, in, july, by,

great, variety, of, wildlife, because, of, its, varied, topography, lakes, and, forests, it, provides, a, home, for, the, red, squirrel, and, colonies, of, sundew, and, butterwort, two, of, the, few, carnivorous, plants, native, to, britain, the, lake, district, is, a, major, sanctuary, for, the, red, squirrel, and, has, the, largest, population, in, england, out, of, the, estimated, 140, 000, red, squirrels, in, the, united, kingdom, compared, with, about, 2, 5, million, grey, squirrels, the, lake, district, is, home, to, a, range, of, bird, species, and, the, rspb, maintain, a, reserve, in, haweswater, england, s, last, nesting, pair, of, golden, eagles, was, found, in, the, lake, district, the, female, was, last, seen, in, 2004, and, the, male, was, last, seen, in, 2015, following, recolonisation, attempts, a, pair, of, ospreys, nested, in, the, lake, district, for, the, first, time, in, over, 150, years, near, bassenthwaite, lake, during, 2001, ospreys, now, frequently, migrate, north, from, africa, in, the, spring, to, nest, in, the, lake, district, and, a, total, of, 23, chicks, have, fledged, in, the, area, since, 2001, another, raptor, that, has, had, recolonisation, attempts, is, the, red, kite, which, as, of, 2012, has, a, population, of, approximately, 90, in, the, dense, forest, areas, near, grizedale, and, successfully, bred, in, 2014, the,

where, red, kite, numbers, are, low, other, bird, species, resident, to, the, lake, district, include, the, buzzard, dipper, peregrine, and, common, raven, seasonal, birds, include, the, ring, ouzel, and, the, common, redstart, the, lakes, of, the, lake, district, support, three, rare, and, endangered, species, of, fish, the, vendace, is, found, only, in, derwent, water, and, until, 2008, bassenthwaite, lake, vendace, have, struggled, in, recent, years, with, naturally, occurring, algae, becoming, a, threat, and, the, lakes, gradually, getting, warmer, vendace, have, been, moved, to, higher, lakes, on, a, number, of, occasions, to, preserve, the, species, notably, in, 2005, and, 2011, the, lakes, are, also, home, to, two, other, rare, species, the, schelly, which, lives, in, brothers, water, haweswater, red, tarn, and, ullswater, and, the, arctic, charr, which, can, be, found, in, buttermere, coniston, water, crummock, water, ennerdale, water, haweswater, loweswater, thirlmere, wast, water, and, windermere, in, recent, years, important, changes, have, been, made, to, fisheries, byelaws, covering, the, northwest, region, of, england, to, help, protect, some, of, the, rarest, fish, species, in, 2002, the, environment, agency, introduced, a, new, fisheries, byelaw, banning, the, use, of, all, freshwater, fish, as, live, or, dead, bait, in, 14, of, the, lakes, in, the, lake, district, bassenthwaite, lake, brothers, water, buttermere, coniston, water, crummock, water, derwent, water, ennerdale, water, haweswater, loweswater, red, tarn, thirlmere, ullswater, wast, water, and, windermere, anglers, not, complying, with, the, new, byelaw, can, face, fines, of, up, to, 2, 500, the, lakes, and, waters, of, the, lake, district, do, not, naturally, support, as, many, species, of, fish, as, other, similar, habitats, in, the, south, of, the, country, and, elsewhere, in, europe, some, fish, that, do, thrive, there, are, particularly, at, risk, from, the, introduction, of, new, species, the, introduction, of, non, native, fish, can, lead, to, the, predation, of, the, native, fish, fauna, or, competition, for, food, there, is, also, the, risk, of, disease, being, introduced, which, can, further, threaten, native, populations, in, some, cases, the, introduced, species, can, disturb, the, environment, so, much, that, it, becomes, unsuitable, for, particular, fish, for, example, a, major, problem, has, been, found, with, ruffe, this, non, native, fish, has, now, been, introduced, into, several, lakes, in, recent, years, it, is, known, that, ruffe, eats, the, eggs, of, vendace, which, are, particularly, vulnerable, because, of, their, long, incubation, period, this, means, that, they, are, susceptible, to, predators, for, up, to, 120, days, the, eggs, of, other, fish, for, example, roach, are, only, at, risk, for, as, little, as, three, days, farming, and, in, particular, sheep, farming, has, been, the, major, industry, in, the, region, since, roman, times, the, breed, most, closely, associated, with, the, area, is, the, tough, herdwick, with, rough, fell, and, swaledale, sheep, also, common, sheep, farming, remains, important, both, for, the, economy, of, the, region, and, for, preserving, the, landscape, which, visitors, want, to, see, features, such, as, dry, stone, walls, for, example, are, there, as, a, result, of, sheep, farming, some, land, is, also, used, for, silage, and, dairy, farming, the, area, was, badly, affected, by, the, outbreak, of, foot, and, mouth, disease, across, the, united, kingdom, in, 2001, the, outbreak, started, in, surrey, in, february, but, had, spread, to, cumbria, by, end, of, march, thousands, of, sheep, including, the, native, herdwicks, which, graze, on, the, fellsides, across, the, district, were, destroyed, in, replacing, the, sheep, one, problem, to, overcome, was, that, many, of, the, lost, sheep, were, heafed, that, is, they, knew, their, part, of, the, unfenced, fell, and, did, not, stray, with, this, knowledge, being, passed, between, generations, with, all, the, sheep, lost, at, once, this, knowledge, has, to, be, relearnt, and, some, of, the, fells, have, had, discreet, electric, fences, strung, across, them, for, a, period, of, five, years, to, allow, the, sheep, to, re, heaf, at, the, time, of, the, outbreak, worries, existed, about, the, future, of, certain, species, of, sheep, such, as, ryeland, and, herdwick, in, the, district, however, these, fears, have, been, allayed, and, sheep, now, occupy, the, district, in, abundance, forestry, has, also, assumed, greater, importance, over, the, last, century, with, the, establishment, of, extensive, conifer, plantations, around, whinlatter, pass, in, ennerdale, and, at, grizedale, forest, among, other, places, there, are, extensive, plantations, of, non, native, pine, trees, with, its, wealth, of, rock, types, and, their, abundance, in, the, landscape, mining, and, quarrying, have, long, been, significant, activities, in, the, lake, district, economy, in, neolithic, times, the, lake, district, was, a, major, source, of, stone, axes, examples, of, which, have, been, found, all, over, britain, the, primary, site, on, the, slopes, of, the, langdale, pikes, is, sometimes, described, as, a, stone, axe, factory, of, the, langdale, axe, industry, some, of, the, earliest, stone, circles, in, britain, are, connected, with, this, industry, mining, particularly, of, copper, lead, often, associated, with, quantities, of, silver, baryte, graphite, and, slate, was, historically, a, major, lakeland, industry, mainly, from, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, coppiced, woodland, was, used, extensively, to, provide, charcoal, for, smelting, some, mining, still, takes, place, today, for, example, slate, mining, continues, at, the, honister, mines, at, the, top, of, honister, pass, abandoned, mine, workings, can, be, found, on, fellsides, throughout, the, district, the, locally, mined, graphite, led, to, the, development, of, the, pencil, industry, especially, around, keswick, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, half, the, world, textile, industry, s, bobbin, supply, came, from, the, lake, district, area, over, the, past, century, however, tourism, has, grown, rapidly, to, become, the, area, s, primary, source, of, income, early, visitors, to, the, lake, district, who, travelled, for, the, education, and, pleasure, of, the, journey, include, celia, fiennes, who, in, 1698, undertook, a, journey, the, length, of, england, including, riding, through, kendal, and, over, kirkstone, pass, into, patterdale, her, experiences, and, impressions, were, published, in, her, book, great, journey, to, newcastle, and, cornwall, as, i, walked, down, at, this, place, i, was, walled, on, both, sides, by, those, inaccessible, high, rocky, barren, hills, which, hang, over, one, s, head, in, some, places, and, appear, very, terrible, and, from, them, springs, many, little, currents, of, water, from, the, sides, and, clefts, which, trickle, down, to, some, lower, part, where, it, runs, swiftly, over, the, stones, and, shelves, in, the, way, which, makes, a, pleasant, rush, and, murmuring, noise, and, like, a, snowball, is, increased, by, each, spring, trickling, down, on, either, side, of, those, hills, and, so, descends, into, the, bottoms, which, are, a, moorish, ground, in, which, in, many, places, the, waters, stand, and, so, form, some, of, those, lakes, as, it, did, here, in, 1724, daniel, defoe, published, the, first, volume, of, a, tour, thro, the, whole, island, of, great, britain, he, commented, on, westmorland, that, it, was, the, wildest, most, barren, and, frightful, of, any, that, i, have, passed, over, in, england, or, even, wales, itself, the, west, side, which, borders, on, cumberland, is, indeed, bounded, by, a, chain, of, almost, unpassable, mountains, which, in, the, language, of, the, country, are, called, fells, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, area, was, becoming, more, popular, with, travellers, this, was, partly, a, result, of, wars, in, continental, europe, restricting, the, possibility, of, travel, there, in, 1778, thomas, west, produced, a, guide, to, the, lakes, which, began, the, era, of, modern, tourism, west, listed, stations, viewpoints, where, tourists, could, enjoy, the, best, views, of, the, landscape, being, encouraged, to, appreciate, the, formal, qualities, of, the, landscape, and, to, apply, aesthetic, values, at, some, of, these, stations, buildings, were, erected, to, help, this, process, the, remains, of, claife, station, on, the, western, shore, windermere, below, claife, heights, can, be, visited, today, william, wordsworth, published, his, guide, to, the, lakes, in, 1810, and, by, 1835, it, had, reached, its, fifth, edition, now, called, a, guide, through, the, district, of, the, lakes, in, the, north, of, england, this, book, was, particularly, influential, in, popularising, the, region, wordsworth, s, favourite, valley, was, dunnerdale, or, the, duddon, valley, in, the, southwest, of, the, lake, district, the, railways, led, to, another, expansion, in, tourism, the, kendal, and, windermere, railway, was, the, first, to, penetrate, the, lake, district, reaching, kendal, in, 1846, and, windermere, in, 1847, the, line, to, coniston, opened, in, 1848, although, until, 1857, this, was, only, linked, to, the, national, network, by, ferries, between, fleetwood, and, barrow, in, furness, the, line, from, penrith, through, keswick, to, cockermouth, in, 1865, and, the, line, to, lakeside, at, the, foot, of, windermere, in, 1869, the, railways, built, with, traditional, industry, in, mind, brought, with, them, a, huge, increase, in, the, number, of, visitors, thus, contributing, to, the, growth, of, the, tourism, industry, railway, services, were, supplemented, by, steamer, boats, on, the, major, lakes, of, ullswater, windermere, coniston, water, and, derwent, water, the, growth, in, tourist, numbers, continued, into, the, age, of, the, motor, car, when, railways, began, to, be, closed, or, run, down, the, formation, of, the, lake, district, national, park, in, 1951, recognised, the, need, to, protect, the, lake, district, environment, from, excessive, commercial, or, industrial, exploitation, preserving, that, which, visitors, come, to, see, without, any, restriction, on, the, movement, of, people, into, and, around, the, district, the, m6, motorway, helped, bring, traffic, to, the, lake, district, passing, up, its, eastern, flank, the, narrow, roads, present, a, challenge, for, traffic, flow, and, since, the, 1960s, certain, areas, have, been, very, congested, this, problem, continues, with, traffic, congestion, and, parking, problems, in, the, towns, and, villages, bowness, on, windermere, addressed, the, parking, issue, with, a, new, car, park, at, the, edge, of, the, community, and, by, extending, an, existing, car, park, the, lake, district, np, publishes, a, list, and, map, of, car, parks, within, its, area, allowing, tourists, to, plan, their, visits, accordingly, whilst, the, roads, and, railways, provided, easier, access, to, the, area, many, people, were, drawn, to, lakeland, by, the, publication, of, the, pictorial, guide, to, the, lakeland, fells, by, alfred, wainwright, first, published, between, 1955, and, 1966, these, books, provided, detailed, information, on, 214, fells, across, the, region, with, carefully, hand, drawn, maps, and, panoramas, and, also, stories, and, asides, which, add, to, the, colour, of, the, area, they, are, still, used, by, many, visitors, to, the, area, as, guides, for, walking, excursions, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, bagging, the, complete, list, of, wainwrights, the, famous, guides, were, revised, by, chris, jesty, between, 2005, and, 2009, to, reflect, changes, mainly, in, valley, access, and, paths, and, are, currently, being, revised, by, clive, hutchby, the, author, of, the, wainwright, companion, the, first, of, the, revised, volumes, book, one, the, eastern, fells, was, published, in, march, 2015, the, most, recent, book, six, the, north, western, fells, was, published, in, april, 2019, since, the, early, 1960s, the, national, park, authority, has, employed, rangers, to, help, cope, with, increasing, tourism, and, development, the, first, being, john, wyatt, who, has, since, written, several, guide, books, he, was, joined, two, years, later, by, a, second, and, since, then,
