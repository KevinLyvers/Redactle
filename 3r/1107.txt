tenochtitlan, was, accomplished, by, the, abundant, indigenous, labor, in, the, surrounding, area, franciscan, friar, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, of, mexico, who, arrived, in, new, spain, in, 1524, described, the, rebuilding, of, the, city, as, one, of, the, afflictions, or, plagues, of, the, early, period, the, seventh, plague, was, the, construction, of, the, great, city, of, mexico, which, during, the, early, years, used, more, people, than, in, the, construction, of, jerusalem, the, crowds, of, laborers, were, so, numerous, that, one, could, hardly, move, in, the, streets, and, causeways, although, they, are, very, wide, many, died, from, being, crushed, by, beams, or, falling, from, high, places, or, in, tearing, down, old, buildings, for, new, ones, preconquest, tenochtitlan, was, built, in, the, center, of, the, inland, lake, system, with, the, city, reachable, by, canoe, and, by, wide, causeways, to, the, mainland, the, causeways, were, rebuilt, under, spanish, rule, with, indigenous, labor, colonial, spanish, cities, were, constructed, on, a, grid, pattern, if, no, geographical, obstacle, prevented, it, in, mexico, city, the, z, calo, main, square, was, the, central, place, from, which, the, grid, was, then, built, outward, the, spanish, lived, in, the, area, closest, to, the, main, square, in, what, was, known, as, the, traza, in, orderly, well, laid, out, streets, indigenous, residences, were, outside, that, exclusive, zone, and, houses, were, haphazardly, located, spaniards, sought, to, keep, indigenous, people, separate, but, since, the, z, calo, was, a, center, of, commerce, for, amerindians, they, were, a, constant, presence, in, the, central, area, so, strict, segregation, was, never, enforced, at, intervals, z, calo, was, where, major, celebrations, took, place, as, well, as, executions, it, was, also, the, site, of, two, major, riots, in, the, seventeenth, century, one, in, 1624, the, other, in, 1692, the, city, grew, as, the, population, did, coming, up, against, the, lake, s, waters, as, the, depth, of, the, lake, water, fluctuated, mexico, city, was, subject, to, periodic, flooding, a, major, labor, draft, the, desag, e, compelled, thousands, of, indigenous, over, the, colonial, period, to, work, on, infrastructure, to, prevent, flooding, floods, were, not, only, an, inconvenience, but, also, a, health, hazard, since, during, flood, periods, human, waste, polluted, the, city, s, streets, by, draining, the, area, the, mosquito, population, dropped, as, did, the, frequency, of, the, diseases, they, spread, however, draining, the, wetlands, also, changed, the, habitat, for, fish, and, birds, and, the, areas, accessible, for, indigenous, cultivation, close, to, the, capital,

unlike, brazil, or, peru, mexico, had, easy, contact, with, both, the, atlantic, and, pacific, worlds, although, the, spanish, crown, tried, to, completely, regulate, all, commerce, in, the, city, it, had, only, partial, success, the, concept, of, nobility, flourished, in, new, spain, in, a, way, not, seen, in, other, parts, of, the, americas, spaniards, encountered, a, society, in, which, the, concept, of, nobility, mirrored, that, of, their, own, spaniards, respected, the, indigenous, order, of, nobility, and, added, to, it, in, the, ensuing, centuries, possession, of, a, noble, title, in, mexico, did, not, mean, one, exercised, great, political, power, for, one, s, power, was, limited, even, if, the, accumulation, of, wealth, was, not, the, concept, of, nobility, in, mexico, was, not, political, but, rather, a, very, conservative, spanish, social, one, based, on, proving, the, worthiness, of, the, family, most, of, these, families, proved, their, worth, by, making, fortunes, in, new, spain, outside, of, the, city, itself, then, spending, the, revenues, in, the, capital, building, churches, supporting, charities, and, building, extravagant, palatial, homes, the, craze, to, build, the, most, opulent, residence, possible, reached, its, height, in, the, last, half, of, the, 18th, century, many, of, these, palaces, can, still, be, seen, today, leading, to, mexico, city, s, nickname, of, the, city, of, palaces, given, by, alexander, von, humboldt, the, grito, de, dolores, cry, of, dolores, also, known, as, el, grito, de, la, independencia, cry, of, independence, marked,

pollution, and, water, pollution, problems, as, well, as, groundwater, related, subsidence, air, and, water, pollution, has, been, contained, and, improved, in, several, areas, due, to, government, programs, the, renovation, of, vehicles, and, the, modernization, of, public, transportation, the, autocratic, government, that, ruled, mexico, city, since, the, revolution, was, tolerated, mostly, because, of, the, continued, economic, expansion, since, world, war, ii, this, was, the, case, even, though, this, government, could, not, handle, the, population, and, pollution, problems, adequately, nevertheless, discontent, and, protests, began, in, the, 1960s, leading, to, the, massacre, of, an, unknown, number, of, protesting, students, in, tlatelolco, three, years, later, a, demonstration, in, the, maestros, avenue, organized, by, former, members, of, the, 1968, student, movement, was, violently, repressed, by, a, paramilitary, group, called, los, halcones, composed, of,

forcing, ordinary, citizens, to, create, and, direct, their, own, rescue, efforts, and, to, reconstruct, much, of, the, housing, that, was, lost, as, well, however, the, last, straw, may, have, been, the, controversial, elections, of, 1988, that, year, the, presidency, was, set, between, the, p, r, i, s, candidate, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, and, a, coalition, of, left, wing, parties, led, by, cuauht, moc, c, rdenas, son, of, the, former, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, the, counting, system, fell, because, coincidentally, the, power, went, out, and, suddenly, when, it, returned, the, winning, candidate, was, salinas, even, though, c, rdenas, had, the, upper, hand, as, a, result, of, the, fraudulent, election, c, rdenas, became, a, member, of, the, party, of, the, democratic,
