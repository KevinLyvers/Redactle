ago, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, celtic, tribes, settled, in, the, region, between, the, rivers, rhine, and, meuse, six, centuries, later, the, romans, would, name, the, celtic, tribes, inhabiting, these, exact, regions, collectively, as, the, treveri, many, examples, of, archaeological, evidence, proving, their, existence, in, luxembourg, have, been, discovered, the, most, famous, being, the,

are, often, described, as, the, ones, having, brought, the, germanic, language, to, present, day, luxembourg, since, the, old, frankish, language, spoken, by, them, is, considered, by, linguists, to, be, a, direct, forerunner, of, the, moselle, franconian, dialect, which, later, evolved, into, among, others, the, modern, day, luxembourgish, language, 70, the, christianization, of, luxembourg, is, usually, dated, back, to, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, the, most, famous, figure, in, this, context, is, willibrord, a, northumbrian, missionary, saint, who, together, with, other, monks,

called, emperor, s, bible, and, the, golden, gospels, of, henry, iii, were, also, produced, in, echternach, at, this, time, 9, 25, when, the, carolingian, empire, was, divided, many, times, starting, with, the, treaty, of, verdun, in, 843, today, s, luxembourgish, territory, became, successively, part, of, the, kingdom, of, middle, francia, 843, 855, the, kingdom, of, lotharingia, 855, 959, and, finally, of, the, duchy, of, lorraine, 959, 1059, which, itself, had, become, a, state, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, recorded, history, of, luxembourg, begins, with, the, acquisition, of, lucilinburhuc, today, luxembourg, castle, situated, on, the, bock, rock, by, siegfried, count, of, the, ardennes, in, 963, through, an, exchange, act, with, st, maximin, s, abbey, trier, around, this, fort, a, town, gradually, developed, which, became, the, center, of, a, state, of, great, strategic, value, within, the, duchy, of, lorraine, over, the, years, the, fortress, was, extended, by, siegfried, s, descendants, and, by, 1083, one, of, them, conrad, i, was, the, first, to, call, himself, a, count, of, luxembourg, and, with, it, effectively, creating, the, independent, county, of, luxembourg, which, was, still, a, state, within, the, holy, roman, empire, by, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, the, counts, of, luxembourg, had, managed, to, gain, considerable, wealth, and, power, and, had, expanded, their, territory, from, the, river, meuse, to, the, moselle, by, the, time, of, the, reign, of, henry, v, the, blonde, bitburg, la, roche, en, ardenne, durbuy, arlon, thionville, marville, longwy, and, in, 1264, the, competing, county, of, vianden, and, with, it, st, vith, and, schleiden, had, either, been, incorporated, directly, or, become, vassal, states, to, the, county, of, luxembourg, the, only, major, setback, during, their, rise, in, power, came, in, 1288, when, henry, vi, and, his, three, brothers, died, at, the, battle, of, worringen, while, trying, unsuccessfully, to, add, the, duchy, of, limburg, to, their, realm, but, despite, the, defeat, the, battle, of, worringen, helped, the, counts, of, luxembourg, to, achieve, military, glory, which, they, had, previously, lacked, as, they, had, mostly, enlarged, their, territory, by, means, of, inheritances, marriages, and, fiefdoms, the, ascension, of, the, counts, of, luxembourg, culminated, when, henry, vii, became, king, of, the, romans, king, of, italy, and, finally, in, 1312, holy, roman, emperor, with, the, ascension, of, henry, vii, as, emperor, the, dynasty, of, the, house, of, luxembourg, not, only, began, to, rule, the, holy, roman, empire, but, rapidly, began, to, exercise, growing, influence, over, other, parts, of, central, europe, as, well, henry, s, son, john, the, blind, in, addition, to, being, count, of, luxembourg, also, became, king, of, bohemia, he, remains, a, major, figure, in, luxembourgish, history, and, folklore, and, is, considered, by, many, historians, the, epitome, of, chivalry, in, medieval, times, he, is, also, known, for, having, founded, the, schueberfouer, in, 1340, and, for, his, heroic, death, at, the, battle, of, cr, cy, in, 1346, john, the, blind, is, considered, a, national, hero, in, luxembourg, in, the, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, three, more, members, of, the, house, of, luxembourg, reigned, as, holy, roman, emperors, and, bohemian, kings, john, s, descendants, charles, iv, sigismund, who, also, was, king, of, hungary, and, croatia, and, wenceslaus, iv, charles, iv, created, the, long, lasting, golden, bull, of, 1356, a, decree, which, fixed, important, aspects, of, the, constitutional, structure, of, the, empire, luxembourg, remained, an, independent, fief, county, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, in, 1354, charles, iv, elevated, it, to, the, status, of, a, duchy, with, his, half, brother, wenceslaus, i, becoming, the, first, duke, of, luxembourg, while, his, kin, were, occupied, ruling, and, expanding, their, power, within, the, holy, roman, empire, and, elsewhere, wenceslaus, annexed, the, county, of, chiny, in, 1364, and, with, it, the, territories, of, the, new, duchy, of, luxembourg, reached, its, greatest, extent, during, these, 130, years, the, house, of, luxembourg, was, contending, with, the, house, of, habsburg, for, supremacy, within, the, holy, roman, empire, and, central, europe, it, all, came, to, end, in, 1443, when, the, house, of, luxembourg, suffered, a, succession, crisis, precipitated, by, the, lack, of, a, male, heir, to, assume, the, throne, since, sigismund, and, elizabeth, of, g, rlitz, were, both, heirless, all, possessions, of, the, luxembourg, dynasty, were, redistributed, among, the, european, aristocracy, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, become, a, possession, of, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, as, the, house, of, luxembourg, had, become, extinct, and, luxembourg, now, became, part, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, this, would, mark, the, start, of, nearly, 400, years, of, foreign, rule, over, luxembourg, in, 1482, philip, the, handsome, inherited, all, of, what, became, then, known, as, the, habsburg, netherlands, and, with, it, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, for, nearly, 320, years, luxembourg, would, remain, a, possession, of, the, mighty, house, of, habsburg, at, first, under, austrian, rule, 1506, 1556, then, under, spanish, rule, 1556, 1714, before, going, back, again, to, austrian, rule, 1714, 1794, with, having, become, a, habsburg, possession, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, became, like, many, countries, in, europe, at, the, time, heavily, involved, in, the, many, conflicts, for, dominance, of, europe, between, the, habsburg, held, countries, and, the, kingdom, of, france, in, 1542, the, king, of, france, fran, ois, i, invaded, luxembourg, twice, but, the, habsburgs, under, charles, v, managed, to, reconquer, the, duchy, each, time, luxembourg, became, part, of, the, spanish, netherlands, in, 1556, and, when, france, and, spain, went, to, war, in, 1635, it, resulted, in, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, in, which, the, first, partition, of, luxembourg, was, decided, under, the, treaty, spain, ceded, the, luxembourgish, fortresses, of, stenay, thionville, and, montm, dy, and, the, surrounding, territory, to, france, effectively, reducing, the, size, of, luxembourg, for, the, first, time, in, centuries, in, context, of, the, nine, years, war, in, 1684, france, invaded, luxembourg, again, conquering, and, occupying, the, duchy, until, 1697, when, it, was, returned, to, the, spanish, in, order, to, garner, support, for, the, bourbon, cause, during, the, prelude, to, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, when, the, war, broke, out, in, 1701, luxembourg, and, the, spanish, netherlands, were, administered, by, the, pro, french, faction, under, the, governor, maximilian, ii, emanuel, elector, of, bavaria, and, sided, with, the, bourbons, the, duchy, was, subsequently, occupied, by, the, pro, austrian, allied, forces, during, the, conflict, and, was, awarded, to, austria, at, its, conclusion, in, 1714, as, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, repeatedly, passed, back, and, forth, from, spanish, and, austrian, to, french, rule, each, of, the, conquering, nations, contributed, to, strengthening, and, expanding, the, fortress, that, the, castle, of, luxembourg, had, become, over, the, years, one, example, of, this, includes, french, military, engineer, marquis, de, vauban, who, advanced, the, fortifications, around, and, on, the, heights, of, the, city, fortification, walls, that, are, still, visible, today, during, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, revolutionary, france, invaded, the, austrian, netherlands, and, with, it, luxembourg, yet, again, in, the, years, 1793, and, 1794, most, of, the, duchy, was, conquered, relatively, quickly, and, the, french, revolutionary, army, committed, many, atrocities, and, pillages, against, the, luxembourgish, civilian, population, and, abbeys, the, most, infamous, being, the, massacres, of, differdange, and, dudelange, as, well, as, the, destruction, of, the, abbeys, of, clairefontaine, echternach, and, orval, however, the, fortress, of, luxembourg, resisted, for, nearly, 7, months, before, the, austrian, forces, holding, it, surrendered, luxembourg, s, long, defense, led, lazare, carnot, to, call, luxembourg, the, best, fortress, in, the, world, except, gibraltar, giving, rise, to, the, city, s, nickname, the, gibraltar, of, the, north, luxembourg, was, annexed, by, france, becoming, the, d, partement, des, for, ts, department, of, forests, and, the, incorporation, of, the, former, duchy, as, a, d, partement, into, france, was, formalised, at, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, in, 1797, from, the, start, of, the, occupation, the, new, french, officials, in, luxembourg, who, spoke, only, french, implemented, many, republican, reforms, among, them, the, principle, of, laicism, which, led, to, an, outcry, in, strongly, catholic, luxembourg, additionally, french, was, implemented, as, the, only, official, language, and, luxembourgish, people, were, barred, access, to, all, civil, services, when, the, french, army, introduced, military, duty, for, the, local, population, riots, broke, out, which, culminated, in, 1798, when, luxembourgish, peasants, started, a, rebellion, even, though, the, french, managed, to, rapidly, suppress, this, revolt, called, kl, ppelkrich, it, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, historical, memory, of, the, country, and, its, citizens, however, many, republican, ideas, of, this, era, continue, to, have, a, lasting, effect, on, luxembourg, one, of, the, many, examples, features, the, implementation, of, the, napoleonic, code, civil, which, was, introduced, in, 1804, and, is, still, valid, today, after, the, defeat, of, napoleon, in, 1815, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, was, restored, however, as, the, territory, had, been, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, as, well, as, the, habsburgian, netherlands, in, the, past, both, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, now, claimed, possession, of, the, territory, at, the, congress, of, vienna, the, great, powers, decided, that, luxembourg, would, become, a, member, state, of, the, newly, formed, german, confederation, but, at, the, same, time, william, i, of, the, netherlands, the, king, of, the, netherlands, would, become, in, personal, union, the, head, of, state, to, satisfy, prussia, it, was, decided, that, not, only, the, fortress, of, luxembourg, be, manned, by, prussian, troops, but, also, that, large, parts, of, luxembourgish, territory, mainly, the, areas, around, bitburg, and, st, vith, become, prussian, possessions, this, marked, the, second, time, that, the, duchy, of, luxembourg, was, reduced, in, size, and, is, generally, known, as, the, second, partition, of, luxembourg, to, compensate, the, duchy, for, this, loss, it, was, decided, to, elevate, the, duchy, to, a, grand, duchy, thus, giving, the, dutch, monarchs, the, additional, title, of, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, after, belgium, became, an, independent, country, following, the, victorious, belgian, revolution, of, 1830, 1831, it, claimed, the, entire, grand, duchy, of, luxembourg, as, being, part, of, belgium, however, the, dutch, king, who, was, also, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, as, well, as, prussia, did, not, want, to, lose, their, grip, on, the, mighty, fortress, of, luxembourg, and, did, not, agree, with, the, belgian, claims, the, dispute, would, be, solved, at, the, 1839, treaty, of, london, where, the, decision, of, the, third, partition, of, luxembourg, was, taken, this, time, the, territory, was, reduced, by, more, than, half, as, the, predominantly, francophone, western, part, of, the, country, but, also, the, then, luxembourgish, speaking, part, of, arelerland, was, transferred, to, the, new, state, of, belgium, thereby, giving, luxembourg, its, modern, day, borders, the, treaty, of, 1839, also, established, full, independence, of, the, remaining, germanic, speaking, grand, duchy, of, luxembourg, in, 1842, luxembourg, joined, the, german, customs, union, zollverein, this, resulted, in, the, opening, of, the, german, market, the, development, of, luxembourg, s, steel, industry, and, expansion, of, luxembourg, s, railway, network, from, 1855, to, 1875, after, the, luxembourg, crisis, of, 1866, nearly, led, to, war, between, prussia, and, france, as, both, were, unwilling, to, see, the, other, taking, influence, over, luxembourg, and, its, mighty, fortress, the, grand, duchy, s, independence, and, neutrality, were, reaffirmed, by, the, second, treaty, of, london, and, prussia, was, finally, willing, to, withdraw, its, troops, from, the, fortress, of, luxembourg, under, the, condition, that, the, fortifications, would, be, dismantled, that, happened, the, same, year, at, the, time, of, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, luxembourg, s, neutrality, was, respected, and, neither, france, nor, germany, invaded, the, country, as, a, result, of, the, recurring, disputes, between, the, major, european, powers, the, people, of, luxembourg, gradually, developed, a, consciousness, of, independence, and, a, national, awakening, took, place, in, the, 19th, century, the, people, of, luxembourg, began, referring, to, themselves, as, luxembourgers, rather, than, being, part, of, one, of, the, larger, surrounding, nations, this, consciousness, of, mir, w, lle, bleiwe, wat, mir, sinn, we, want, to, remain, what, we, are, culminated, in, 1890, when, the, last, step, towards, full, independence, was, finally, taken, due, to, a, succession, crisis, the, dutch, monarchy, ceased, to, hold, the, title, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, beginning, with, adolph, of, nassau, weilburg, the, grand, duchy, would, have, their, own, monarchy, thus, reaffirming, its, full, independence, in, august, 1914, during, world, war, i, imperial, germany, violated, luxembourg, s, neutrality, by, invading, it, in, order, to, defeat, france, nevertheless, despite, the, german, occupation, luxembourg, was, allowed, to, maintain, much, of, its, independence, and, political, mechanisms, unaware, of, the, fact, that, germany, secretly, planned, to, annex, the, grand, duchy, in, case, of, a, german, victory, the, septemberprogramm, the, luxembourgish, government, continued, to, pursue, a, policy, of, strict, neutrality, however, the, luxembourgish, population, did, not, believe, germany, had, good, intentions, fearing, that, it, would, annex, luxembourg, around, 1, 000, luxembourgers, served, in, the, french, army, their, sacrifices, have, been, commemorated, at, the, g, lle, fra, after, the, war, grand, duchess, marie, ad, la, de, was, seen, by, many, people, including, the, french, and, belgian, governments, as, having, collaborated, with, the, germans, and, calls, for, her, abdication, and, the, establishment, of, a, republic, became, louder, after, the, retreat, of, the, german, army, communists, in, luxembourg, city, and, esch, sur, alzette, tried, to, establish, a, soviet, worker, s, republic, similar, to, the, ones, emerging, in, germany, but, these, attempts, lasted, only, 2, days, in, november, 1918, a, motion, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, demanding, the, abolition, of, the, monarchy, was, defeated, narrowly, by, 21, votes, to, 19, with, three, abstentions, france, questioned, the, luxembourgish, government, s, and, especially, marie, ad, la, de, s, neutrality, during, the, war, and, calls, for, an, annexation, of, luxembourg, to, either, france, or, belgium, grew, louder, in, both, countries, in, january, 1919, a, company, of, the, luxembourgish, army, rebelled, declaring, itself, to, be, the, army, of, the, new, republic, but, french, troops, intervened, and, put, an, end, to, the, rebellion, nonetheless, the, disloyalty, shown, by, her, own, armed, forces, was, too, much, for, marie, ad, la, de, who, abdicated, in, favor, of, her, sister, charlotte, 5, days, later, the, same, year, in, a, popular, referendum, 77, 8, of, the, luxembourgish, population, declared, in, favor, of, maintaining, monarchy, and, rejected, the, establishment, of, a, republic, during, this, time, belgium, pushed, for, an, annexation, of, luxembourg, however, all, such, claims, were, ultimately, dismissed, at, the, paris, peace, conference, thus, securing, luxembourg, s, independence, in, 1940, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, luxembourg, s, neutrality, was, violated, again, when, nazi, germany, s, wehrmacht, entered, the, country, entirely, without, justification, in, contrast, to, the, first, world, war, under, the, german, occupation, of, luxembourg, during, world, war, ii, the, country, was, treated, as, german, territory, and, informally, annexed, to, the, adjacent, province, of, nazi, germany, gau, moselland, this, time, luxembourg, did, not, remain, neutral, as, luxembourg, s, government, in, exile, based, in, london, supported, the, allies, sending, a, small, group, of, volunteers, who, participated, in, the, normandy, invasion, and, multiple, resistance, groups, formed, inside, the, occupied, country, with, 2, 45, of, its, prewar, population, killed, and, a, third, of, all, buildings, in, luxembourg, being, destroyed, or, heavily, damaged, mainly, due, to, the, battle, of, the, bulge, luxembourg, suffered, the, highest, such, loss, in, western, europe, but, its, commitment, to, the, allied, war, effort, was, never, questioned, around, 1, 000, 2, 500, of, luxembourg, s, jews, were, murdered, in, the, holocaust, the,
