and, have, suggested, it, was, populated, at, least, partially, by, an, early, indo, european, speaking, people, it, is, possible, that, the, name, armenia, originates, in, armini, urartian, for, inhabitant, of, arme, or, armean, country, the, arme, tribe, of, urartian, texts, may, have, been, the, urumu, who, in, the, 12th, century, bc, attempted, to, invade, assyria, from, the, north, with,
