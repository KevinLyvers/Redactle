dialogue, partner, of, the, shanghai, cooperation, organization, bahrain, is, the, dual, form, of, arabic, word, bahr, meaning, literally, sea, so, al, bahrayn, originally, means, literally, the, two, seas, however, the, name, has, been, lexicalised, as, a, feminine, proper, noun, and, does, not, follow, the, grammatical, rules, for, duals, thus, its, form, is, always, bahrayn, and, never, bahr, n, the, expected, nominative, form, endings, are, added, to, the, word, with, no, changes, as, in, the, name, of, the, national, anthem, bahraynun, our, bahrain, or, the, demonym, bahrayn, the, medieval, grammarian, al, jawahari, commented, on, this, saying, that, the, more, formally, correct, term, bahr, lit, belonging, to, the, sea, would, have, been, misunderstood, and, so, was, unused, it, remains, disputed, which, two, seas, the, name, bahrayn, originally, refers, to, the, term, appears, five, times, in, the, quran, but, does, not, refer, to, the, modern, island, originally, known, to, the, arabs, as, awal, today, bahrain, s, two, seas, are, generally, taken, to, be, the, bay, east, and, west, of, the, island, the, seas, north, and, south, of, the, island, or, the, salt, and, fresh, water, present, above, and, below, the, ground, in, addition, to, wells, there, are, areas, of, the, sea, north, of, bahrain, where, fresh, water, bubbles, up, in, the, middle, of, the, saltwater, as, noted, by, visitors, since, antiquity, an, alternative, theory, concerning, bahrain, s, toponymy, is, offered, by, the, al, ahsa, region, which, suggests, that, the, two, seas, were, the, great, green, ocean, the, persian, gulf, and, a, peaceful, lake, on, the, arabian, mainland, until, the, late, middle, ages, bahrain, referred, to, the, region, of, eastern, arabia, that, included, southern, iraq, kuwait, al, hasa, qatif, and, bahrain, the, region, stretched, from, basra, in, iraq, to, the, strait, of, hormuz, in, oman, this, was, iql, m, al, bahrayn, s, bahrayn, province, the, exact, date, at, which, the, term, bahrain, began, to, refer, solely, to, the, awal, archipelago, is, unknown, the, entire, coastal, strip, of, eastern, arabia, was, known, as, bahrain, for, a, millennium, the, island, and, kingdom, were, also, commonly, spelled, bahrein, into, the, 1950s, bahrain, was, home, to, dilmun, an, important, bronze, age, trade, centre, linking, mesopotamia, and, the, indus, valley, bahrain, was, later, ruled, by, the, assyrians, and, babylonians, from, the, sixth, to, third, century, bc, bahrain, was, part, of, the, achaemenid, empire, by, about, 250, bc, parthia, brought, the, persian, gulf, under, its, control, and, extended, its, influence, as, far, as, oman, the, parthians, established, garrisons, along, the, southern, coast, of, the, persian, gulf, to, control, trade, routes, during, the, classical, era, bahrain, was, referred, to, by, the, ancient, greeks, as, tylos, the, centre, of, pearl, trading, when, the, greek, admiral, nearchus, serving, under, alexander, the, great, landed, on, bahrain, nearchus, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, of, alexander, s, commanders, to, visit, the, island, and, he, found, a, verdant, land, that, was, part, of, a, wide, trading, network, he, recorded, that, on, the, island, of, tylos, situated, in, the, persian, gulf, are, large, plantations, of, cotton, trees, from, which, are, manufactured, clothes, called, sindones, of, strongly, differing, degrees, of, value, some, being, costly, others, less, expensive, the, use, of, these, is, not, confined, to, india, but, extends, to, arabia, the, greek, historian, theophrastus, states, that, much, of, bahrain, was, covered, by, these, cotton, trees, and, that, bahrain, was, famous, for, exporting, walking, canes, engraved, with, emblems, that, were, customarily, carried, in, babylon, alexander, had, planned, to, settle, greek, colonists, in, bahrain, and, although, it, is, not, clear, that, this, happened, on, the, scale, he, envisaged, bahrain, became, very, much, part, of, the, hellenised, world, the, language, of, the, upper, classes, was, greek, although, aramaic, was, in, everyday, use, local, coinage, shows, a, seated, zeus, who, may, have, been, worshipped, there, as, a, syncretised, form, of, the, arabian, sun, god, shams, tylos, was, also, the, site, of, greek, athletic, contests, the, greek, historian, strabo, believed, the, phoenicians, originated, from, bahrain, herodotus, also, believed, that, the, homeland, of, the, phoenicians, was, bahrain, this, theory, was, accepted, by, the, 19th, century, german, classicist, arnold, heeren, who, said, that, in, the, greek, geographers, for, instance, we, read, of, two, islands, named, tyrus, or, tylos, and, aradus, which, boasted, that, they, were, the, mother, country, of, the, phoenicians, and, exhibited, relics, of, phoenician, temples, the, people, of, tyre, in, particular, have, long, maintained, persian, gulf, origins, and, the, similarity, in, the, words, tylos, and, tyre, has, been, commented, upon, however, there, is, little, evidence, of, any, human, settlement, at, all, on, bahrain, during, the, time, when, such, migration, had, supposedly, taken, place, the, name, tylos, is, thought, to, be, a, hellenisation, of, the, semitic, tilmun, from, dilmun, the, term, tylos, was, commonly, used, for, the, islands, until, ptolemy, s, geographia, when, the, inhabitants, are, referred, to, as, thilouanoi, some, place, names, in, bahrain, go, back, to, the, tylos, era, for, instance, the, name, of, arad, a, residential, suburb, of, muharraq, is, believed, to, originate, from, arados, the, ancient, greek, name, for, muharraq, in, the, 3rd, century, ardashir, i, the, first, ruler, of, the, sassanid, dynasty, marched, on, oman, and, bahrain, where, he, defeated, sanatruq, the, ruler, of, bahrain, bahrain, was, also, the, site, of, worship, of, an, ox, deity, called, awal, arabic, worshipers, built, a, large, statue, to, awal, in, muharraq, although, it, has, now, been, lost, for, many, centuries, after, tylos, bahrain, was, known, as, awal, by, the, 5th, century, bahrain, became, a, centre, for, nestorian, christianity, with, the, village, samahij, as, the, seat, of, bishops, in, 410, according, to, the, oriental, syriac, church, synodal, records, a, bishop, named, batai, was, excommunicated, from, the, church, in, bahrain, as, a, sect, the, nestorians, were, often, persecuted, as, heretics, by, the, byzantine, empire, but, bahrain, was, outside, the, empire, s, control, offering, some, safety, the, names, of, several, muharraq, villages, today, reflect, bahrain, s, christian, legacy, with, al, dair, meaning, the, monastery, bahrain, s, pre, islamic, population, consisted, of, christian, arabs, mostly, abd, al, qays, persians, zoroastrians, jews, and, aramaic, speaking, agriculturalists, according, to, robert, bertram, serjeant, the, baharna, may, be, the, arabised, descendants, of, converts, from, the, original, population, of, christians, aramaeans, jews, and, persians, inhabiting, the, island, and, cultivated, coastal, provinces, of, eastern, arabia, at, the, time, of, the, muslim, conquest, the, sedentary, people, of, pre, islamic, bahrain, were, aramaic, speakers, and, to, some, degree, persian, speakers, while, syriac, functioned, as, a, liturgical, language,

to, the, bahrain, region, by, muhammad, in, ad, 628, and, that, munzir, ibn, sawa, al, tamimi, the, local, ruler, responded, to, his, mission, and, converted, the, entire, area, in, the, year, 899, the, qarmatians, a, millenarian, ismaili, muslim, sect, seized, bahrain, seeking, to, create, a, utopian, society, based, on, reason, and, redistribution, of, property, among, initiates, thereafter, the, qarmatians, demanded, tribute, from, the, caliph, in, baghdad, and, in, 930, sacked, mecca, bringing, the, sacred, black, stone, back, to, their, base, in, ahsa, in, medieval, bahrain, for,
