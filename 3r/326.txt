69, 30, s, 65, 00, w, 69, 500, s, 65, 000, w, 69, 500, 65, 000, the, antarctic, peninsula, known, as, o, higgins, land, in, chile, and, tierra, de, san, mart, n, in, argentina, and, originally, as, graham, land, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, palmer, peninsula, in, the, united, states, is, the, northernmost, part, of, mainland, antarctica, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, part, of, the, larger, peninsula, of, west, antarctica, protruding, 1, 300, km, 810, miles, from, a, line, between, cape, adams, weddell, sea, and, a, point, on, the, mainland, south, of, the, eklund, islands, beneath, the, ice, sheet, that, covers, it, the, antarctic, peninsula, consists, of, a, string, of, bedrock, islands, these, are, separated, by, deep, channels, whose, bottoms, lie, at, depths, considerably, below, current, sea, level, they, are, joined, by, a, grounded, ice, sheet, tierra, del, fuego, the, southernmost, tip, of, south, america, is, about, 1, 000, km, 620, miles, away, across, the, drake, passage, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, 522, 000, square, kilometres, 202, 000, sq, mi, in, area, and, 80, ice, covered, the, marine, ecosystem, around, the, western, continental, shelf, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, wap, has, been, subjected, to, rapid, climate, change, over, the, past, 50, years, the, warm, moist, maritime, climate, of, the, northern, wap, has, shifted, south, this, climatic, change, increasingly, displaces, the, once, dominant, cold, dry, continental, antarctic, climate, this, regional, warming, has, caused, multi, level, responses, in, the, marine, ecosystem, such, as, increased, heat, transport, decreased, sea, ice, extent, and, duration, local, declines, in, ice, dependent, ad, lie, penguins, increase, in, ice, tolerant, gentoo, and, chinstrap, penguins, alterations, in, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, community, composition, as, well, as, changes, in, krill, recruitment, abundance, and, availability, to, predators, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, currently, dotted, with, numerous, research, stations, and, nations, have, made, multiple, claims, of, sovereignty, the, peninsula, is, part, of, disputed, and, overlapping, claims, by, argentina, chile, and, the, united, kingdom, none, of, these, claims, have, international, recognition, and, under, the, antarctic, treaty, system, the, respective, countries, do, not, attempt, to, enforce, their, claims, the, british, claim, however, is, recognised, by, australia, france, new, zealand, and, norway, argentina, has, the, most, bases, and, personnel, stationed, on, the, peninsula, the, most, likely, first, sighting, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, therefore, also, of, the, whole, antarctic, mainland, was, on, 27, january, 1820, by, an, expedition, of, the, imperial, russian, navy, led, by, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, but, the, party, did, not, recognize, as, the, mainland, what, they, thought, was, an, icefield, covered, by, small, hillocks, three, days, later, on, 30, january, 1820, edward, bransfield, and, william, smith, with, a, british, expedition, were, the, first, to, chart, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, this, area, was, later, to, be, called, trinity, peninsula, and, is, the, extreme, northeast, portion, of, the, peninsula, the, next, confirmed, sighting, was, in, 1832, by, john, biscoe, a, british, explorer, who, named, the, northern, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, as, graham, land, the, first, european, to, land, on, the, continent, is, also, disputed, a, 19th, century, seal, hunter, john, davis, was, almost, certainly, the, first, but, sealers, were, secretive, about, their, movements, and, their, logbooks, were, deliberately, unreliable, to, protect, any, new, sealing, grounds, from, competition, between, 1901, and, 1904, otto, nordenskj, ld, led, the, swedish, antarctic, expedition, one, of, the, first, expeditions, to, explore, parts, of, antarctica, they, landed, on, the, antarctic, peninsula, in, february, 1902, aboard, the, ship, antarctic, which, sank, not, far, from, the, peninsula, all, crew, were, rescued, by, an, argentine, ship, the, british, graham, land, expedition, between, 1934, and, 1937, carried, out, aerial, surveys, using, a, de, havilland, fox, moth, aircraft, and, concluded, that, graham, land, was, not, an, archipelago, but, a, peninsula, agreement, on, the, name, antarctic, peninsula, by, the, advisory, committee, on, antarctic, names, and, uk, antarctic, place, names, committee, in, 1964, resolved, a, long, standing, difference, over, the, use, of, the, united, states, name, palmer, peninsula, or, the, british, name, graham, land, for, this, geographic, feature, this, dispute, was, resolved, by, making, graham, land, the, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, northward, of, a, line, between, cape, jeremy, and, cape, agassiz, and, palmer, land, the, part, southward, of, that, line, which, is, roughly, 69, s, palmer, land, is, named, for, the, united, states, seal, hunter, nathaniel, palmer, the, chilean, name, for, the, feature, o, higgins, land, is, in, honor, of, bernardo, o, higgins, the, chilean, patriot, and, antarctic, visionary, most, other, spanish, speaking, countries, call, it, la, pen, nsula, ant, rtica, though, argentina, also, officially, refers, to, this, as, tierra, de, san, mart, n, as, of, 2018, argentina, has, more, bases, and, personnel, in, the, peninsula, than, any, other, nation, other, portions, of, the, peninsula, are, named, by, and, after, the, various, expeditions, that, discovered, them, including, the, bowman, black, danco, davis, english, falli, res, nordenskj, ld, loubet, and, wilkins, coasts, the, first, antarctic, research, stations, were, established, during, world, war, ii, by, a, british, military, operation, operation, tabarin, the, 1950s, saw, a, marked, increase, in, the, number, of, research, bases, as, britain, chile, and, argentina, competed, to, make, claims, over, the, same, area, meteorology, and, geology, were, the, primary, research, subjects, since, the, peninsula, has, the, mildest, climate, in, antarctica, the, highest, concentration, of, research, stations, on, the, continent, can, be, found, there, or, on, the, many, nearby, islands, and, it, is, the, part, of, antarctica, most, often, visited, by, tour, vessels, and, yachts, occupied, bases, include, base, general, bernardo, o, higgins, riquelme, bellingshausen, station, carlini, base, comandante, ferraz, antarctic, station, palmer, station, rothera, research, station, and, san, mart, n, base, today, on, the, antarctic, peninsula, there, are, many, abandoned, scientific, and, military, bases, argentina, s, esperanza, base, was, the, birthplace, of, emilio, marcos, palma, the, first,

antarctic, peninsula, also, located, here, are, the, scaife, mountains, the, eternity, range, is, found, in, the, middle, of, the, peninsula, other, geographical, features, include, avery, plateau, the, twin, towers, of, una, peaks, because, the, antarctic, peninsula, which, reaches, north, of, the, antarctic, circle, is, the, most, northerly, part, of, antarctica, it, has, the, mildest, climates, within, this, continent, its, climate, is, therefore, classified, as, a, tundra, rather, than, an, ice, cap, its, temperatures, are, warmest, in, january, averaging, 1, to, 2, c, 34, to, 36, f, and, coldest, in, june, averages, from, 15, to, 20, c, 5, to, 4, f, its, west, coast, from, the, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, south, to, 68, s, which, has, a, maritime, antarctic, climate, is, the, mildest, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, within, this, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, temperatures, exceed, 0, c, 32, f, for, 3, or, 4, months, during, the, summer, and, rarely, fall, below, 10, c, 14, f, during, the, winter, farther, south, along, the, west, coast, and, the, northeast, coast, of, the, peninsula, mean, monthly, temperatures, exceed, 0, c, 32, f, for, only, one, or, two, months, of, summer, and, average, around, 15, c, 5, f, in, winter, the, east, coast, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, south, of, 63, s, is, generally, much, colder, with, mean, temperatures, exceeding, 0, c, 32, f, for, at, most, one, month, of, summer, and, winter, mean, temperatures, ranging, from, 5, to, 25, c, 23, to, 13, f, the, colder, temperatures, of, the, southeast, weddell, sea, side, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, are, reflected, in, the, persistence, of, ice, shelves, that, cling, to, the, eastern, side, precipitation, varies, greatly, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, from, the, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, to, 68, s, precipitation, averages, 35, 50, cm, 14, 20, in, per, year, a, good, portion, of, this, precipitation, falls, as, rain, during, the, summer, on, two, thirds, of, the, days, of, the, year, and, with, little, seasonal, variation, in, amounts, between, about, 68, s, and, 63, s, on, the, west, coast, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, along, its, northeast, coast, precipitation, is, 35, cm, 14, in, or, less, with, occasional, rain, along, the, east, coast, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, south, of, 63, s, precipitation, ranges, from, 10, to, 15, cm, 3, 9, to, 5, 9, in, in, comparison, the, subantarctic, islands, have, precipitation, of, 100, 200, cm, 39, 79, in, per, year, and, the, dry, interior, of, antarctica, is, a, virtual, desert, with, only, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, precipitation, per, year, because, of, issues, concerning, global, climate, change, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, adjacent, parts, of, the, weddell, sea, and, its, pacific, continental, shelf, have, been, the, subject, of, intensive, geologic, paleontologic, and, paleoclimatic, research, by, interdisciplinary, and, multinational, groups, over, the, last, several, decades, the, combined, study, of, the, glaciology, of, its, ice, sheet, and, the, paleontology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, structural, geology, and, volcanology, of, glacial, and, nonglacial, deposits, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, has, allowed, the, reconstruction, of, the, paleoclimatology, and, prehistoric, ice, sheet, fluctuation, of, it, for, over, the, last, 100, million, years, this, research, shows, the, dramatic, changes, in, climate, which, have, occurred, within, this, region, after, it, reached, its, approximate, position, within, the, antarctic, circle, during, the, cretaceous, period, the, fossil, bluff, group, which, outcrops, within, alexander, island, provides, a, detailed, record, which, includes, paleosols, and, fossil, plants, of, middle, cretaceous, albian, terrestrial, climates, the, sediments, that, form, the, fossil, bluff, group, accumulated, within, a, volcanic, island, arc, which, now, forms, the, bedrock, backbone, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, in, prehistoric, floodplains, and, deltas, and, offshore, as, submarine, fans, and, other, marine, sediments, as, reflected, in, the, plant, fossils, paleosols, and, climate, models, the, climate, was, warm, humid, and, seasonally, dry, according, to, climate, models, the, summers, were, dry, and, winters, were, wet, the, rivers, were, perennial, and, subject, to, intermittent, flooding, as, the, result, of, heavy, rainfall, warm, high, latitude, climates, reached, a, peak, during, the, mid, late, cretaceous, cretaceous, thermal, maximum, plant, fossils, found, within, the, late, cretaceous, coniacian, and, santonian, early, campanian, strata, of, the, hidden, lake, and, santa, maria, formations, which, outcrop, within, james, ross, seymour, and, adjacent, islands, indicate, that, this, emergent, volcanic, island, arc, enjoyed, warm, temperate, or, subtropical, climates, with, adequate, moisture, for, growth, and, without, extended, periods, of, below, freezing, winter, temperatures, after, the, peak, warmth, of, the, cretaceous, thermal, maximum, the, climate, both, regionally, and, globally, appears, to, have, cooled, as, seen, in, the, antarctic, fossil, wood, record, later, warm, high, latitude, climates, returned, to, the, antarctic, peninsula, region, during, the, paleocene, and, early, eocene, as, reflected, in, fossil, plants, abundant, plant, and, marine, fossils, from, paleogene, marine, sediments, that, outcrop, on, seymour, island, indicate, the, presence, of, cool, and, moist, high, latitudes, environment, during, the, early, eocene, detailed, studies, of, the, paleontology, sedimentology, and, stratigraphy, of, glacial, and, nonglacial, deposits, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, adjacent, parts, of, the, weddell, sea, and, its, pacific, continental, shelf, have, found, that, it, has, become, progressively, glaciated, as, the, climate, of, antarctica, dramatically, and, progressively, cooled, during, the, last, 37, million, years, this, progressive, cooling, was, contemporaneous, with, a, reduction, in, atmospheric, co, 2, concentrations, during, this, climatic, cooling, the, antarctic, peninsula, was, probably, the, last, region, of, antarctica, to, have, been, fully, glaciated, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, mountain, glaciation, was, initiated, during, the, latest, eocene, about, 37, 34, ma, the, transition, from, temperate, alpine, glaciation, to, a, dynamic, ice, sheet, occurred, about, 12, 8, ma, at, this, time, the, antarctic, peninsula, formed, as, the, bedrock, islands, underlying, it, were, overridden, and, joined, by, an, ice, sheet, in, the, early, pliocene, about, 5, 3, 3, 6, ma, during, the, quaternary, period, the, size, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, has, fluctuated, in, response, to, glacial, interglacial, cycles, during, glacial, epochs, this, ice, sheet, was, significantly, thicker, than, it, is, currently, and, extended, to, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelves, during, interglacial, epochs, the, west, antarctica, ice, sheet, was, thinner, than, during, glacial, epochs, and, its, margins, lay, significantly, inland, of, the, continental, margins, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, about, 20, 000, to, 18, 000, years, ago, the, ice, sheet, covering, the, antarctic, peninsula, was, significantly, thicker, than, it, is, now, except, for, a, few, isolated, nunataks, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, its, associated, islands, were, completely, buried, by, the, ice, sheet, in, addition, the, ice, sheet, extended, past, the, present, shoreline, onto, the, pacific, outer, continental, shelf, and, completely, filled, the, weddell, sea, up, to, the, continental, margin, with, grounded, ice, the, deglaciation, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, largely, occurred, between, 18, 000, and, 6, 000, years, ago, as, an, interglacial, climate, was, established, in, the, region, it, initially, started, about, 18, 000, to, 14, 000, years, ago, with, retreat, of, the, ice, sheet, from, the, pacific, outer, continental, shelf, and, the, continental, margin, within, the, weddell, sea, within, the, weddell, sea, the, transition, from, grounded, ice, to, a, floating, ice, shelf, occurred, about, 10, 000, years, ago, the, deglaciation, of, some, locations, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, continued, until, 4, 000, to, 3, 000, years, ago, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, an, interglacial, climatic, optimum, occurred, about, 3, 000, to, 5, 000, years, ago, after, the, climate, optimum, a, distinct, climate, cooling, which, lasted, until, historic, times, occurred, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, a, part, of, the, world, that, is, experiencing, extraordinary, warming, each, decade, for, the, last, five, average, temperatures, in, the, antarctic, peninsula, have, risen, by, 0, 5, c, 0, 90, f, ice, mass, loss, on, the, peninsula, occurred, at, a, rate, of, 60, billion, tons, year, in, 2006, with, the, greatest, change, occurring, in, the, northern, tip, of, the, peninsula, seven, ice, shelves, along, the, antarctic, peninsula, have, retreated, or, disintegrated, in, the, last, two, decades, research, by, the, united, states, geological, survey, has, revealed, that, every, ice, front, on, the, southern, half, of, the, peninsula, experienced, a, retreat, between, 1947, and, 2009, according, to, a, study, by, the, british, antarctic, survey, glaciers, on, the, peninsula, are, not, only, retreating, but, also, increasing, their, flow, rate, as, a, result, of, increased, buoyancy, in, the, lower, parts, of, the, glaciers, professor, david, vaughan, has, described, the, disintegration, of, the, wilkins, ice, shelf, as, the, latest, evidence, of, rapid, warming, in, the, area, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, has, been, unable, to, determine, the, greatest, potential, effect, on, sea, level, rise, that, glaciers, in, the, region, may, cause, the, coasts, of, the, peninsula, have, the, mildest, climate, in, antarctica, and, moss, and, lichen, covered, rocks, are, free, of, snow, during, the, summer, months, although, the, weather, is, still, intensely,

antarctic, peninsula, and, southern, south, america, also, present, are, the, antarctic, petrel, antarctic, shag, king, penguin, macaroni, penguin, and, arctic, tern, although, this, very, remote, part, of, the, world, has, never, been, inhabited, and, is, protected, by, the, antarctic, treaty, system, which, bans, industrial, development, waste, disposal, and, nuclear, testing, there, is, still, a, threat, to, these, fragile, ecosystems, from, increasing, tourism, primarily, on, cruises, across, the, southern, ocean, from, the, port, of, ushuaia, argentina, a, rich, record, of, fossil, leaves, wood, pollen, and, flowers, demonstrates, that, flowering, plants, thrived, in, subtropical, climates, within, the, volcanic, island, arcs, that, occupied, the, antarctic, peninsula, region, during, the, cretaceous, and, very, early, paleogene, periods, the, analysis, of, fossil, leaves, and, flowers, indicates, that, semitropical, woodlands, which, were, composed, of, ancestors, of, plants, that, live, in, the, tropics, today, thrived, within, this, region, during, a, global, thermal, maximum, with, summer, temperatures, that, averaged, 20, c, 68, f, the, oldest, fossil, plants, come, from, the, middle, cretaceous, albian, fossil, bluff, group, which, outcrop, along, the, edge, of, alexander, island, these, fossils, reveal, that, at, this, time, the, forests, consisted, of, large, conifers, with, mosses, and, ferns, in, the, undergrowth, the, paleosols, in, which, trees, are, rooted, have, physical, characteristics, indicative, of, modern, soils, that, form, under, seasonally, dry, climates, with, periodic, high, rainfall, younger, cretaceous, strata, which, outcrop, within, james, ross, seymour, and, adjacent, islands, contain, fossil, plants, of, late, cretaceous, angiosperms, with, leaf, morphotypes, that, are, similar, to, those, of, living, families, such, as, sterculiaceae, lauraceae, winteraceae, cunoniaceae, and, myrtaceae, they, indicate, that, the, emergent, parts, of, the, volcanic, island, arc, the, eroded, roots, of, which, now, form, the, central, part, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, were, covered, by, either, warm, temperate, or, subtropical, forests, these, fossil, plants, are, indicative, of, tropical, and, subtropical, forest, at, high, paleolatitudes, during, the, middle, and, late, cretaceous, which, grew, in, climates, without, extended, periods, of, below, freezing, winter, temperatures, and, with, adequate, moisture, for, growth, the, cretaceous, strata, of, james, ross, island, also, yielded, the, dinosaur, genus, antarctopelta, which, was, the, first, dinosaur, fossil, to, be, found, on, antarctica, paleogene, and, early, eocene, marine, sediments, that, outcrop, on, seymour, island, contain, plant, rich, horizons, the, fossil, plants, are, dominated, by, permineralized, branches, of, conifers, and, compressions, of, angiosperm, leaves, and, are, found, within, carbonate, concretions, these, seymour, island, region, fossils, date, to, about, 51, 5, 49, 5, ma, and, are, dominated, by, leaves, cone, scales, and, leafy, branches, of, araucarian, conifers, very, similar, in, all, respects, to, living, araucaria, araucana, monkey, puzzle, from, chile, they, suggest, that, the, adjacent, parts, of, the, prehistoric, antarctic, peninsula, were, covered, by, forests, that, grew, in, a, cool, and, moist, high, latitude, environment, during, the, early, eocene, during, the, cenozoic, climatic, cooling, the, antarctic, peninsula, was, the, last, region, of, antarctica, to, have, been, fully, glaciated, according, to, current, research, as, a, result, this, region, was, probably, the, last, refugium, for, plants, and, animals, that, had, inhabited, antarctica, after, it, separated, from, the, gondwanaland, supercontinent, analysis, of, paleontologic, stratigraphic, and, sedimentologic, data, acquired, from, the, study, of, drill, core, and, seismic, acquired, during, the, shallow, drilling, on, the, antarctic, continental, shelf, shaldril, and, other, projects, and, from, fossil, collections, from, and, rock, outcrops, within, alexander, james, ross, king, george, seymour, and, south, shetland, islands, has, yielded, a, record, of, the, changes, in, terrestrial, vegetation, that, occurred, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, over, the, course, of, the, past, 37, million, years, this, research, found, that, vegetation, within, the, antarctic, peninsula, changed, in, response, to, a, progressive, climatic, cooling, that, started, with, the, initiation, of, mountain, glaciation, in, the, latest, eocene, about, 37, 34, ma, the, cooling, was, contemporaneous, with, glaciation, elsewhere, in, antarctica, and, a, reduction, in, atmospheric, co, 2, concentrations, initially, during, the, eocene, this, climate, cooling, resulted, in, a, decrease, in, diversity, of, the, angiosperm, dominated, vegetation, that, inhabited, the, northern, antarctic, peninsula, during, the, oligocene, about, 34, 23, ma, these, woodlands, were, replaced, by, a, mosaic, of, southern, beech, nothofagus, and, conifer, dominated, woodlands, and, tundra, as, the, climate, continued, to, cool, by, middle, miocene, 16, 11, 6, ma, a, tundra, landscape, completely, replaced, any, remaining, woodlands, at, this, time, woodlands, became, completely, extirpated, from, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, all, of, antarctica, a, tundra, landscape, probably, persisted, until, about, 12, 8, ma, when, the, transition, from, a, temperate, alpine, glaciation, to, a, dynamic, ice, sheet, occurred, eventually, the, antarctic, peninsula, was, overridden, by, an, ice, sheet, which, has, persisted, without, any, interruption, to, this, day, in, the, early, pliocene, about, 5, 3, 3, 6, ma
