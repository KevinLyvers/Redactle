aligned, movement, bolivarian, alliance, for, the, peoples, of, our, america, and, community, of, latin, american, and, caribbean, states, there, are, two, prevailing, theories, on, how, the, name, nicaragua, came, to, be, the, first, is, that, the, name, was, coined, by, spanish, colonists, based, on, the, name, nicarao, who, was, the, chieftain, or, cacique, of, a, powerful, indigenous, tribe, encountered, by, the, spanish, conquistador, gil, gonz, lez, d, vila, during, his, entry, into, southwestern, nicaragua, in, 1522, this, theory, holds, that, the, name, nicaragua, was, formed, from, nicarao, and, agua, spanish, for, water, to, reference, the, fact, that, there, are, two, large, lakes, and, several, other, bodies, of, water, within, the, country, however, as, of, 2002, it, was, determined, that, the, cacique, s, real, name, was, macuilmiquiztli, which, meant, five, deaths, in, the, nahuatl, language, rather, than, nicarao, the, second, theory, is, that, the, country, s, name, comes, from, any, of, the, following, nahuatl, words, nic, anahuac, which, meant, anahuac, reached, this, far, or, the, nahuas, came, this, far, or, those, who, come, from, anahuac, came, this,
