the, sea, of, japan, see, below, for, other, names, is, the, marginal, sea, between, the, japanese, archipelago, sakhalin, the, korean, peninsula, and, the, mainland, of, the, russian, far, east, the, japanese, archipelago, separates, the, sea, from, the, pacific, ocean, like, the, mediterranean, sea, it, has, almost, no, tides, due, to, its, nearly, complete, enclosure, from, the, pacific, ocean, this, isolation, also, affects, faunal, diversity, and, salinity, both, of, which, are, lower, than, in, the, open, ocean, the, sea, has, no, large, islands, bays, or, capes, its, water, balance, is, mostly, determined, by, the, inflow, and, outflow, through, the, straits, connecting, it, to, the, neighboring, seas, and, the, pacific, ocean, few, rivers, discharge, into, the, sea, and, their, total, contribution, to, the, water, exchange, is, within, 1, the, seawater, has, an, elevated, concentration, of, dissolved, oxygen, that, results, in, high, biological, productivity, therefore, fishing, is, the, dominant, economic, activity, in, the, region, the, intensity, of, shipments, across, the, sea, has, been, moderate, owing, to, political, issues, but, it, is, steadily, increasing, as, a, result, of, the, growth, of, east, asian, economies, sea, of, japan, is, the, dominant, term, used, in, english, for, the, sea, and, the, name, in, most, european, languages, is, equivalent, but, it, is, sometimes, called, by, different, names, in, surrounding, countries, the, sea, is, called, nihon, kai, literally, japan, sea, in, japan, r, b, n, h, i, japan, sea, or, originally, j, ng, h, i, whale, sea, in, china, yaponskoye, more, japanese, sea, in, russia, chos, n, tonghae, literally, korean, east, sea, in, north, korea, and, donghae, literally, east, sea, in, south, korea, the, use, of, the, term, sea, of, japan, as, the, dominant, name, is, a, point, of, contention, south, korea, wants, the, name, east, sea, to, be, used, either, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, sea, of, japan, while, north, korea, prefers, the, name, east, sea, of, korea, the, primary, issue, in, the, dispute, revolves, around, a, disagreement, about, when, the, name, sea, of, japan, became, the, international, standard, japan, claims, the, term, has, been, the, international, standard, since, at, least, the, early, 19th, century, while, the, koreas, claim, that, the, term, sea, of, japan, arose, later, while, korea, was, under, japanese, rule, and, before, that, occupation, other, names, such, as, sea, of, korea, or, east, sea, were, used, in, english, in, 2012, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, the, intergovernmental, organization, that, maintains, a, publication, listing, the, limits, of, ocean, and, sea, areas, around, the, world, abandoned, its, most, recent, of, several, attempts, in, the, last, 25, years, to, revise, its, publication, of, the, sea, s, name, this, was, primarily, because, of, the, lack, of, agreement, between, the, koreas, and, japan, over, the, naming, issue, in, september, 2020, the, iho, announced, that, it, would, adopt, a, new, numerical, system, also, known, as, s, 130, in, november, 2020, s, 23, the, previous, version, of, the, nautical, chart, made, in, 1953, will, be, made, public, as, an, iho, publication, to, demonstrate, the, evolutionary, process, from, the, analogue, to, the, digital, era, the, iho, approved, the, proposal, of, the, new, official, nautical, chart, the, new, chart, will, be, marked, with, a, numerical, identifier, without, a, name, for, centuries, the, sea, had, protected, japan, from, land, invasions, particularly, by, the, mongols, it, had, long, been, navigated, by, asian, and, from, the, 18th, century, by, european, ships, russian, expeditions, of, 1733, 1743, mapped, sakhalin, and, the, japanese, islands, in, the, 1780s, the, frenchman, jean, fran, ois, de, galaup, comte, de, lap, rouse, traveled, northward, across, the, sea, through, the, strait, later, named, after, him, in, 1796, a, british, naval, officer, william, robert, broughton, explored, the, strait, of, tartary, the, eastern, coast, of, the, russian, far, east, and, the, korean, peninsula, in, 1803, 1806, the, russian, navigator, adam, johann, von, krusenstern, while, sailing, across, the, globe, in, the, ship, nadezhda, also, explored, in, passing, the, sea, of, japan, and, the, eastern, shores, of, japanese, islands, in, 1849, another, russian, explorer, gennady, nevelskoy, discovered, the, strait, between, the, continent, and, sakhalin, and, mapped, the, northern, part, of, the, strait, of, tartary, russian, expeditions, were, made, in, 1853, 1854, and, 1886, 1889, to, measure, the, surface, temperatures, and, record, the, tides, they, also, documented, the, cyclonal, character, of, the, sea, currents, other, notable, expeditions, of, the, 19th, century, include, the, american, north, pacific, exploring, and, surveying, expedition, 1853, 1856, and, british, challenger, expedition, 1872, 1876, the, aquatic, life, was, described, by, v, k, brazhnikov, in, 1899, 1902, and, p, yu, schmidt, in, 1903, 1904, the, japanese, scientific, studies, of, the, sea, began, only, in, 1915, and, became, systematic, since, the, 1920s, american, canadian, and, french, whaleships, cruised, for, whales, in, the, sea, between, 1847, and, 1892, most, entered, the, sea, via, korea, strait, and, left, via, la, p, rouse, strait, but, some, entered, and, exited, via, tsugaru, strait, they, primarily, targeted, right, whales, but, began, catching, humpbacks, as, right, whale, catches, declined, they, also, made, attempts, to, catch, blue, and, fin, whales, but, these, species, invariably, sank, after, being, killed, right, whales, were, caught, from, march, to, september, with, peak, catches, in, may, and, june, during, the, peak, years, of, 1848, and, 1849, a, total, of, over, 170, vessels, over, 60, in, 1848, and, over, 110, in, 1849, cruised, in, the, sea, of, japan, with, significantly, lesser, numbers, in, following, years, the, sea, of, japan, was, landlocked, when, the, land, bridge, of, east, asia, existed, the, japan, arc, started, to, form, in, the, early, miocene, in, the, early, miocene, the, japan, sea, started, to, open, and, the, northern, and, southern, parts, of, the, japanese, archipelago, separated, from, each, other, during, the, miocene, the, sea, of, japan, expanded, the, north, part, of, the, japanese, archipelago, was, further, fragmented, later, until, orogenesis, of, the, north, eastern, japanese, archipelago, began, in, the, later, late, miocene, the, south, part, of, the, japanese, archipelago, remained, as, a, relatively, large, landmass, the, land, area, had, expanded, northward, in, the, late, miocene, the, orogenesis, of, high, mountain, ranges, in, north, eastern, japan, started, in, late, miocene, and, lasted, in, pliocene, also, the, eastern, margin, of, the, sea, may, host, an, incipient, subduction, zone, responsible, for, large, earthquakes, in, 1940, 1964, 1983, and, 1993, nowadays, the, sea, of, japan, is, bounded, by, the, russian, mainland, and, sakhalin, island, to, the, north, the, korean, peninsula, to, the, west, and, the, japanese, islands, of, hokkaid, honsh, and, ky, sh, to, the, east, and, south, it, is, connected, to, other, seas, by, five, straits, the, strait, of, tartary, between, the, asian, mainland, and, sakhalin, la, p, rouse, strait, between, sakhalin, and, hokkaid, the, tsugaru, strait, between, hokkaid, and, honsh, the, kanmon, straits, between, honsh, and, ky, sh, and, the, korea, strait, between, the, korean, peninsula, and, ky, sh, the, korea, strait, is, composed, of, the, western, channel, and, the, tsushima, strait, on, either, side, of, tsushima, island, the, straits, were, formed, in, recent, geologic, periods, the, oldest, of, them, are, the, tsugaru, and, tsushima, straits, their, formation, had, interrupted, the, migration, of, elephants, into, the, japanese, islands, at, the, end, of, the, neogene, period, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, the, most, recent, is, la, perouse, strait, which, formed, about, 60, 000, to, 11, 000, years, ago, closing, the, path, used, by, mammoths, which, had, earlier, moved, to, northern, hokkaid, all, the, straits, are, rather, shallow, with, a, minimal, depth, of, the, order, of, 100, meters, or, less, this, hinders, water, exchange, thereby, isolating, the, water, and, aquatic, life, of, the, sea, of, japan, from, the, neighboring, seas, and, oceans, the, sea, has, a, surface, area, of, about, 1, 050, 000, km, 2, 410, 000, sq, mi, a, mean, depth, of, 1, 752, m, 5, 748, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 4, 568, m, 14, 987, ft, it, has, a, carrot, like, shape, with, the, major, axis, extending, from, south, west, to, north, east, and, a, wide, southern, part, narrowing, toward, the, north, the, coastal, length, is, about, 7, 600, km, 4, 700, mi, with, the, largest, part, 3, 240, km, or, 2, 010, mi, belonging, to, russia, the, sea, extends, from, north, to, south, for, more, than, 2, 255, km, 1, 401, mi, and, has, a, maximum, width, of, about, 1, 070, km, 660, mi, it, has, three, major, basins, the, yamato, basin, in, the, south, east, the, japan, basin, in, the, north, and, the, tsushima, basin, ulleung, basin, in, the, south, west, the, japan, basin, is, of, oceanic, origin, and, is, the, deepest, part, of, the, sea, whereas, the, tsushima, basin, is, the, shallowest, with, the, depths, below, 2, 300, m, 7, 500, ft, on, the, eastern, shores, the, continental, shelves, of, the, sea, are, wide, but, on, the, western, shores, particularly, along, the, korean, coast, they, are, narrow, averaging, about, 30, km, 19, mi, there, are, three, distinct, continental, shelves, in, the, northern, part, above, 44, n, they, form, a, staircase, like, structure, with, the, steps, slightly, inclined, southwards, and, submerged, to, the, depths, of, 900, 1, 400, 3, 000, 4, 600, 1, 700, 2, 000, 5, 600, 6, 600, and, 2, 300, 2, 600, m, 7, 500, 8, 500, ft, the, last, step, sharply, drops, to, the, depths, of, about, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, toward, the, central, deepest, part, of, the, sea, the, bottom, of, this, part, is, relatively, flat, but, has, a, few, plateaus, in, addition, an, underwater, ridge, rising, up, to, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, runs, from, north, to, south, through, the, middle, of, the, central, part, the, japanese, coastal, area, of, the, sea, consists, of, okujiri, ridge, sado, ridge, hakusan, banks, wakasa, ridge, and, oki, ridge, yamato, ridge, is, of, continental, origin, and, is, composed, of, granite, rhyolite, andesite, and, basalt, it, has, an, uneven, bottom, covered, with, boulders, of, volcanic, rock, most, other, areas, of, the, sea, are, of, oceanic, origin, seabed, down, to, 300, m, 980, ft, is, of, continental, nature, and, is, covered, with, a, mixture, of, mud, sand, gravel, and, fragments, of, rock, the, depths, between, 300, and, 800, m, 980, and, 2, 620, ft, are, covered, in, hemipelagic, sediments, i, e, of, semi, oceanic, origin, these, sediments, are, composed, of, blue, mud, rich, in, organic, matter, pelagic, sediments, of, red, mud, dominate, the, deeper, regions, there, are, no, large, islands, in, the, sea, most, of, the, smaller, ones, are, near, the, eastern, coast, except, for, ulleungdo, south, korea, the, most, significant, islands, are, moneron, rebun, rishiri, okushiri, shima, sado, okinoshima, ulleungdo, askold, russky, and, putyatin, the, shorelines, are, relatively, straight, and, lack, large, bays, and, capes, the, coastal, shapes, are, simplest, in, sakhalin, and, are, more, winding, in, the, japanese, islands, the, largest, bays, are, peter, the, great, gulf, sovetskaya, gavan, vladimira, bay, olga, posyet, bay, in, russia, east, korea, bay, in, north, korea, and, ishikari, hokkaid, toyama, honsh, and, wakasa, honsh, bays, in, japan,

and, oki, in, japan, and, musu, dan, in, north, korea, as, world, sea, level, dropped, during, the, ice, cap, advances, of, the, last, ice, age, the, exit, straits, of, the, sea, of, japan, one, by, one, dried, and, closed, there, is, controversy, as, to, whether, or, not, in, each, ice, cap, advance, the, world, sea, level, fell, low, enough, for, the, deepest, the, western, channel, of, the, korea, strait, to, dry, and, close, turning, the, sea, of, japan, into, a, huge, cold, inland, lake, with, a, surface, layer, of, fresh, water, freezing, over, in, the, winters, the, sea, climate, has, warm, waters, and, monsoons, this, combination, results, in, strong, evaporation, which, is, especially, noticeable, between, october, and, march, when, the, strong, 12, 15, m, s, or, higher, north, western, monsoon, wind, brings, cold, and, dry, continental, air, the, evaporation, is, blown, further, south, causing, snowfall, in, the, mountainous, western, coasts, of, japan, this, winter, monsoon, brings, typhoons, and, storms, with, the, waves, reaching, 8, 10, m, 26, 33, ft, which, erode, the, western, coasts, of, japan, tsunami, waves, have, also, been, recorded, in, the, sea, in, addition, the, monsoon, enhances, the, surface, water, convection, down, to, the, depths, of, 30, m, 98, ft, the, coldest, months, are, january, and, february, with, an, average, air, temperature, of, 20, c, 4, f, in, the, north, and, 5, c, 41, f, in, the, south, the, northern, one, quarter, of, the, sea, particularly, the, siberian, coast, and, the, strait, of, tartary, freezes, for, about, 4, 5, months, the, timing, and, extent, of, freezing, vary, from, year, to, year, so, ice, may, start, forming, in, the, bays, as, early, as, october, and, its, remains, may, be, seen, even, in, june, ice, cover, is, continuous, only, in, the, bays, and, forms, floating, patches, in, the, open, sea, ice, melting, in, spring, results, in, cold, currents, in, the, northern, areas, in, summer, the, wind, weakens, to, 2, 7, m, s, 6, 6, 23, 0, ft, s, and, reverses, its, direction, blowing, warm, and, humid, air, from, the, north, pacific, onto, the, asian, mainland, the, warmest, month, is, august, with, an, average, air, temperature, of, 15, c, 59, f, in, the, north, and, 25, c, 77, f, in, the, south, annual, precipitation, increases, from, 310, 500, mm, 12, 20, in, in, the, north, west, to, 1, 500, 2, 000, mm, 59, 79, in, in, the, south, east, a, peculiar, turbulent, cloud, pattern, named, von, k, rm, n, vortices, is, sometimes, observed, over, the, sea, of, japan, it, requires, a, stable, field, of, low, clouds, driven, by, the, wind, over, a, small, isolated, and, tall, obstacle, and, usually, forms, over, small, mountainous, islands, the, sea, of, japan, meets, these, conditions, as, it, has, frequent, winds, and, cloudy, skies, as, well, as, compact, tall, islands, such, as, rishiri, 1, 721, m, or, 5, 646, ft, ulleungdo, 984, m, or, 3, 228, ft, and, shima, 732, m, or, 2, 402, ft, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, japan, sea, as, follows, on, the, southwest, the, northeastern, limit, of, the, eastern, china, sea, and, the, western, limit, of, the, inland, sea, on, the, southeast, in, simonoseki, kaikyo, a, line, running, from, nagoya, saki, 130, 49, 5, e, in, ky, sy, through, the, islands, of, uma, sima, and, muture, sima, 33,

currents, circulate, in, the, counterclockwise, direction, the, kuroshio, japan, current, the, tsushima, current, and, the, east, korea, warm, current, bring, warmer, and, more, saline, water, to, the, north, there, they, merge, into, the, tsugaru, current, and, flow, into, the, pacific, ocean, through, the, tsugaru, strait, they, also, feed, the, s, ya, current, and, exit, through, the, la, perouse, strait, to, the, sea, of, okhotsk, the, returning, branch, is, composed, of, the, liman, north, korea, and, central, or, mid, japan, sea, currents, which, bring, fresh, and, cold, water, along, the, asian, coast, to, the, south, water, temperature, is, mostly, affected, by, exchange, with, the, atmosphere, in, the, northern, part, of, the, sea, and, by, the, currents, in, the, southern, part, winter, temperatures, are, 0, c, 32, f, or, below, in, the, north, and, 10, 14, c, 50, 57, f, in, the, south, in, this, season, there, is, a, significant, temperature, difference, between, the, western, and, eastern, parts, owing, to, the, circular, currents, so, at, the, latitude, of, peter, the, great, gulf, the, water, temperature, is, about, 0, c, 32, f, in, the, west, and, 5, 6, c, 41, 43, f, in, the, east, this, east, west, difference, drops, to, 1, 2, c, 1, 8, 3, 6, f, in, summer, and, the, temperatures, rise, to, 18, 20, c, 64, 68, f, in, the, north, and, 25, 27, c, 77, 81, f, in, the, south, because, the, sea, is, enclosed, its, waters, form, clearly, separated, layers, which, may, show, seasonal, and, spatial, dependence, in, winter, the, temperature, is, almost, constant, with, the, depth, in, the, northern, part, of, the, sea, however, in, central, southern, parts, it, may, be, 8, 10, c, 46, 50, f, down, to, 100, 150, m, 330, 490, ft, 2, 4, c, 36, 39, f, at, 200, 250, m, 660, 820, ft, 1, 0, 1, 5, c, 33, 8, 34, 7, f, at, 400, 500, m, 1, 300, 1, 600, ft, and, then, remain, at, about, 0, c, 32, f, until, the, bottom, heating, by, the, sun, and, tropical, monsoons, increases, the, depth, gradient, in, spring, summer, in, the, north, the, surface, layer, down, to, 15, m, or, 49, ft, may, heat, up, to, 18, 20, c, 64, 68, f, the, temperature, would, drop, sharply, to, 4, c, 39, f, at, 50, m, 160, ft, then, slowly, decrease, to, 1, c, 34, f, at, 250, m, 820, ft, and, remain, so, down, to, the, seabed, on, the, contrary, the, temperature, in, the, south, could, gradually, decrease, to, 6, c, 43, f, at, 200, m, 660, ft, then, to, 2, c, 36, f, at, 260, m, 850, ft, and, to, 0, 04, 0, 14, c, 32, 07, 32, 25, f, at, 1, 000, 1, 500, m, 3, 300, 4, 900, ft, but, then, it, would, rise, to, about, 0, 3, c, 32, 5, f, near, the, bottom, this, cold, layer, at, about, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, is, formed, by, sinking, of, cold, water, in, the, northern, part, of, the, sea, in, winter, and, is, brought, south, by, the, sea, currents, it, is, rather, stable, and, is, observed, all, through, the, year, the, hydrological, isolation, of, the, sea, of, japan, also, results, in, slightly, lower, average, water, salinity, 34, 09, where, means, parts, per, thousand, compared, with, the, pacific, ocean, in, winter, the, highest, salinity, at, 34, 5, is, observed, in, the, south, where, evaporation, dominates, over, precipitation, it, is, the, lowest, at, 33, 8, in, the, south, east, and, south, west, because, of, frequent, rains, and, remains, at, about, 34, 09, in, most, other, parts, thawing, of, ice, in, spring, reduces, water, salinity, in, the, north, but, it, remains, high, at, 34, 60, 34, 70, in, the, south, partly, because, of, the, inflow, of, salty, water, through, the, korea, strait, a, typical, variation, of, salinity, across, the, sea, in, summer, is, 31, 5, to, 34, 5, from, north, to, south, the, depth, distribution, of, salinity, is, relatively, constant, the, surface, layer, tends, to, be, more, fresh, in, the, sea, parts, which, experience, ice, melting, and, rains, the, average, water, density, is, 1, 0270, g, cm, 3, in, the, north, and, 1, 0255, g, cm, 3, in, the, south, in, winter, it, lowers, in, summer, to, 1, 0253, and, 1, 0215, g, cm, 3, respectively, few, rivers, flow, into, the, sea, of, japan, from, mainland, asia, the, largest, being, tumen, rudnaya, samarga, partizanskaya, and, tumnin, all, of, them, have, a, mountainous, character, in, contrast, numerous, large, rivers, flow, from, honsh, and, hokkaid, into, the, sea, including, japan, s, four, largest, rivers, the, shinano, ishikari, agano, and, mogami, the, total, annual, river, discharge, into, the, sea, is, 210, km, 3, 50, cu, mi, and, is, relatively, constant, through, the, year, except, for, a, minor, increase, in, july, most, water, 97, or, 52, 200, km, 3, flows, into, the, sea, through, the, korea, strait, and, discharges, through, the, tsugaru, 64, or, 34, 610, km, 3, la, p, rouse, 10, 380, km, 3, and, korea, straits, rainfall, evaporation, and, riverine, inflow, make, only, 1, of, the, water, balance, between, october, and, april, the, outflow, exceeds, the, inflow, due, to, the, lower, income, through, the, korea, strait, this, balance, reverses, between, may, and, september, the, sea, has, complex, tides, which, are, induced, by, the, tidal, wave, of, the, pacific, ocean, penetrating, through, the, korea, strait, and, tsugaru, strait, the, tides, are, semi, diurnal, rise, twice, a, day, in, the, korea, strait, and, in, the, northern, part, of, the, strait, of, tartary, they, are, diurnal, at, the, eastern, shore, of, korea, russian, far, east, and, the, japanese, islands, of, honsh, and, hokkaid, mixed, tides, occur, in, peter, the, great, gulf, and, korea, strait, the, tidal, waves, have, a, speed, of, 10, 25, cm, s, 4, 10, in, s, in, the, open, sea, they, accelerate, in, the, korea, strait, 40, 60, cm, s, or, 16, 24, in, s, la, p, rouse, strait, 50, 100, cm, s, or, 20, 40, in, s, and, especially, in, the, tsugaru, strait, 100, 200, cm, s, or, 40, 80, in, s, the, amplitude, of, the, tides, is, relatively, low, and, varies, strongly, across, the, sea, it, reaches, 3, meters, in, the, south, near, the, korea, strait, but, quickly, drops, northwards, to, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, at, the, southern, tip, of, korean, peninsula, and, to, 0, 5, m, 1, 6, ft, at, the, north, korean, shores, similar, low, tides, are, observed, in, hokkaid, honsh, and, south, sakhalin, the, amplitude, however, increases, to, 2, 3, 2, 8, m, 7, 5, 9, 2, ft, toward, the, north, of, the, strait, of, tartary, due, to, its, funnel, like, shape, apart, from, tides, the, water, level, also, displays, seasonal, monsoon, related, variations, across, the, entire, sea, with, the, highest, levels, observed, in, summer, and, lowest, in, winter, wind, may, also, locally, change, the, water, level, by, 20, 25, cm, 8, 10, in, for, example, it, is, higher, in, summer, at, the, korean, and, lower, at, the, japanese, coasts, the, sea, waters, have, blue, to, green, blue, color, and, a, transparency, of, about, 10, m, 33, ft, they, are, rich, in, dissolved, oxygen, especially, in, the, western, and, northern, parts, which, are, colder, and, have, more, phytoplankton, than, the, eastern, and, southern, areas, the, oxygen, concentration, is, 95, of, the, saturation, point, near, the, surface, it, decreases, with, the, depth, to, about, 70, at, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, the, high, concentration, of, dissolved, oxygen, results, in, the, rich, aquatic, life, of, the, sea, of, japan, there, are, more, than, 800, species, of, aquatic, plants, and, more, than, 3, 500, animal, species, including, more, than, 900, species, of, crustaceans, about, 1, 000, of, fish, and, 26, of, mammals, the, coastal, areas, contain, several, kg, m, 2, of, biomass, pelagic, oceanic, fishes, include, saury, mackerel, jack, mackerels, sardines, anchovies, herring, sea, bream, squid, and, various, species, of, salmon, and, trout, the, demersal, sea, bottom, fishes, include, cod, pollock, and, atka, mackerel, mammals, are, represented, by, seals, and, whales, ancient, name, for, the, basin, in, chinese, was, sea, of, whales, and, the, crustaceans, by, shrimps, and, crabs, because, of, the, shallow, straits, connecting, the, sea, with, pacific, ocean, the, sea, of, japan, has, no, characteristic, oceanic, deep, water, fauna, flora, and, fauna, unique, to, the, region, near, the, sea, of, japan, are, known, as, japan, sea, elements, fishery, had, long, been, the, main, economic, activity, on, the, sea, of, japan, it, is, mainly, carried, out, on, and, near, the, continental, shelves, and, focuses, on, herring, sardines, and, bluefin, tuna, these, species, are, however, depleted, from, after, world, war, ii, squid, is, mostly, caught, near, the, sea, center, and, salmon, near, the, northern, and, south, western, shores, there, is, also, a, well, developed, seaweed, production, the, importance, of, the, fishery, in, the, sea, is, illustrated, by, the, territorial, disputes, between, japan, and, south, korea, over, liancourt, rocks, and, between, japan, and, russia, over, the, kuril, islands, it, is, also, reflected, in, various, legends, such, as, the, legend, of, the, heishi, rock, which, says, that, once, when, herring, vanished, an, old, fairy, threw, a, bottle, with, magic, water, into, the, sea, and, the, herring, returned, the, bottle, got, stuck, to, the, seabed, and, turned, into, a, rock, which, became, a, representation, of, the, god, of, the, sea, of, japan, vladivostok, is, a, base, for, the, russian, whaling, fleet, although, it, operates, in, the, northern, seas, its, production, is, processed, and, partly, distributed, in, the, vladivostok, area, vladivostok, is, also, a, terminal, point, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, which, brings, many, goods, to, and, from, this, major, port, there, is, a, regular, ferry, service, across, the, strait, of, tartary, between, the, russian, continental, port, of, vanino, and, kholmsk, in, sakhalin, the, sea, has, magnetite, sands, as, well, as, natural, gas, and, petroleum, fields, near, the, northern, part, of, japan, and, sakhalin, island, the, intensity, of, shipments, across, the, sea, is, moderate, owing, to, the, cold, relations, between, many, bordering, countries, as, a, result, the, largest, japanese, ports, are, on, the, pacific, coast, and, the, significant, ports, on, the, sea, of, japan, are, niigata, tsuruta, and, maizuru, major, south, korean, ports, are, busan, ulsan, and, pohang, situated, on, the, south, eastern, coast, of, the, korean, peninsula, but, they, also, mainly, target, countries, not, bordering, the, sea, of, japan, the, major, russian, port, of, vladivostok, mainly, serves, inland, cargos, whereas, nakhodka, and, vostochny, are, more, international, and, have, a, busy, exchange, with, japan, and, south, korea, other, prominent, russian, ports, are, sovetskaya, gavan, alexandrovsk, sakhalinsky, and, kholmsk, and, the, major, ports, of, north, korea, are, wonsan, hamhung, and, chongjin, the, intensity, of, shipments, across, the, sea, of, japan, is, steadily, increasing, as, a, result, of, the, growth, of, east, asian, economies,
