the, deccan, is, a, large, plateau, and, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, located, between, the, western, ghats, and, the, eastern, ghats, and, is, loosely, defined, as, the, peninsular, region, between, these, ranges, that, is, south, of, the, narmada, river, to, the, north, it, is, bounded, by, the, satpura, and, vindhya, ranges, it, covers, the, modern, day, indian, states, of, maharashtra, telangana, karnataka, and, andhra, pradesh, a, rocky, terrain, marked, by, boulders, its, elevation, ranges, between, 100, and, 1, 000, metres, 330, and, 3, 280, ft, with, an, average, of, about, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, it, slopes, generally, eastward, and, thus, its, principal, rivers, the, godavari, krishna, and, kaveri, cauvery, flow, eastward, from, the, western, ghats, to, the, bay, of, bengal, the, plateau, is, drier, than, the, coastal, region, of, southern, india, and, is, arid, in, places, the, deccan, plateau, has, produced, some, of, the, major, dynasties, in, indian, history, including, the, pallava, satavahana, vakataka, chalukya, and, rashtrakuta, dynasties, also, the, western, chalukya, empire, the, kadambas, the, yadava, dynasty, the, kakatiya, empire, the, musunuri, nayakas, regime, the, vijayanagara, and, the, maratha, empires, as, well, as, the, muslim, bahmani, sultanate, the, deccan, sultanates, and, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, the, word, deccan, is, an, anglicized, version, of, the, prakrit, word, dakkha, a, which, is, used, in, other, languages, of, the, deccan, including, kannada, telugu, marathi, and, dakhni, it, has, etymological, roots, in, the, sanskrit, dak, i, a, meaning, south, which, evolved, into, the, later, prakrit, one, geographers, have, variously, defined, the, deccan, region, using, indices, such, as, rainfall, vegetation, soil, type, or, physical, features, according, to, one, geographical, definition, it, is, the, peninsular, tableland, lying, to, the, south, of, the, tropic, of, cancer, its, outer, boundary, is, marked, by, the, 300, m, contour, line, with, vindhya, kaimur, watersheds, in, the, north, this, area, can, be, subdivided, into, two, major, geologic, physiographic, regions, an, igneous, rock, plateau, with, fertile, black, soil, and, a, gneiss, peneplain, with, infertile, red, soil, interrupted, by, several, hills, historians, have, defined, the, term, deccan, differently, these, definitions, range, from, a, narrow, one, by, r, g, bhandarkar, 1920, who, defines, deccan, as, the, marathi, speaking, area, lying, between, the, godavari, and, krishna, rivers, to, a, broad, one, by, k, m, panikkar, 1969, who, defines, it, as, the, entire, indian, peninsula, to, the, south, of, the, vindhyas, firishta, 16th, century, defined, deccan, as, the, territory, inhabited, by, the, native, speakers, of, kannada, marathi, and, telugu, languages, richard, m, eaton, 2005, settles, on, this, linguistic, definition, for, a, discussion, of, the, region, s, geopolitical, history, stewart, n, gordon, 1998, notes, that, historically, the, term, deccan, and, the, northern, border, of, deccan, has, varied, from, tapti, river, in, the, north, to, godavari, river, in, the, south, depending, on, the, southern, boundary, of, the, northern, empires, therefore, while, discussing, the, history, of, the, marathas, gordon, uses, deccan, as, a, relational, term, defining, it, as, the, area, beyond, the, southern, border, of, a, northern, based, kingdom, of, india, the, deccan, plateau, is, a, topographically, variegated, region, located, south, of, the, gangetic, plains, the, portion, lying, between, the, arabian, sea, and, the, bay, of, bengal, and, includes, a, substantial, area, to, the, north, of, the, satpura, range, which, has, popularly, been, regarded, as, the, divide, between, northern, india, and, the, deccan, the, plateau, is, bounded, on, the, east, and, west, by, the, ghats, while, its, northern, extremity, is, the, vindhya, range, the, deccan, s, average, elevation, is, about, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, sloping, generally, eastward, its, principal, rivers, the, godavari, krishna, and, kaveri, flow, from, the, western, ghats, eastward, to, the, bay, of, bengal, tiruvannamalai, and, vellore, in, tamil, nadu, is, often, regarded, as, the, southern, gateway, of, the, deccan, plateau, the, western, ghats, mountain, range, is, very, massive, and, blocks, the, moisture, from, the, southwest, monsoon, from, reaching, the, deccan, plateau, so, the, region, receives, very, little, rainfall, the, eastern, deccan, plateau, is, at, a, lower, elevation, spanning, the, southeastern, coast, of, india, its, forests, are, also, relatively, dry, but, serve, to, retain, the, rain, to, form, streams, that, feed, into, rivers, that, flow, into, basins, and, then, into, the, bay, of, bengal, most, deccan, plateau, rivers, flow, south, most, of, the, northern, part, of, the, plateau, is, drained, by, the, godavari, river, and, its, tributaries, including, the, indravati, river, starting, from, the, western, ghats, and, flowing, east, towards, the, bay, of, bengal, most, of, the, central, plateau, is, drained, by, the, tungabhadra, river, krishna, river, and, its, tributaries, including, the, bhima, river, which, also, run, east, the, southernmost, part, of, the, plateau, is, drained, by, the, kaveri, river, which, rises, in, the, western, ghats, of, karnataka, and, bends, south, to, break, through, the, nilgiri, hills, at, the, island, town, of, shivanasamudra, and, then, falls, into, tamil, nadu, at, hogenakal, falls, before, flowing, into, the, stanley, reservoir, and, the, mettur, dam, that, created, the, reservoir, and, finally, emptying, into, the, bay, of, bengal, on, the, western, edge, of, the, plateau, lie, the, sahyadri, the, nilgiri, the, anaimalai, and, the, elamalai, hills, commonly, known, as, western, ghats, the, average, height, of, the, western, ghats, which, run, along, the,

dry, and, hot, with, temperatures, regularly, exceeding, 35, c, the, plateau, s, climate, is, drier, than, that, on, the, coasts, and, is, arid, in, places, although, sometimes, used, to, mean, all, of, india, south, of, the, narmada, river, the, word, deccan, relates, more, specifically, to, that, area, of, rich, volcanic, soils, and, lava, covered, plateaus, in, the, northern, part, of, the, peninsula, between, the, narmada, and, krishna, rivers, the, northwestern, part, of, the, deccan, plateau, a, precambrian, shield, is, partially, covered, by, the, deccan, traps, deccan, steps, a, large, igneous, province, made, up, of, a, series, of, flood, basalt, lava, flows, this, rocky, material, covers, the, whole, of, maharashtra, thereby, making, it, one, of, the, largest, volcanic, provinces, in, the, world, it, consists, of, more, than, 2, 000, metres, 7, 000, ft, of, basalt, lava, flows, and, covers, an, area, of, nearly, 500, 000, km, 2, 190, 000, sq, mi, in, west, central, india, estimates, of, the, original, area, covered, by, the, lava, flows, are, as, high, as, 1, 500, 000, km, 2, 580, 000, sq, mi, the, volume, of, basalt, is, estimated, to, be, 511, 000, km, 3, the, deep, dark, silty, soil, found, here, is, suitable, for, cotton, cultivation, typically, the, deccan, plateau, is, made, up, of, basalt, an, extrusive, igneous, rock, extending, up, to, bhor, ghat, near, karjat, also, in, certain, sections, of, the, region, we, can, find, granite, which, is, an, intrusive, igneous, rock, the, difference, between, these, two, rock, types, is, that, basalt, rock, forms, on, eruption, of, lava, that, is, on, the, surface, either, out, of, a, volcano, or, through, massive, fissures, as, in, the, deccan, basalts, in, the, ground, while, granite, forms, deep, within, the, earth, granite, is, a, felsic, rock, meaning, it, is, rich, in, potassium, feldspar, and, quartz, this, composition, is, continental, in, origin, meaning, it, is, the, primary, composition, of, the, continental, crust, since, it, cooled, relatively, slowly, it, has, large, visible, crystals, basalt, on, the, other, hand, is, mafic, in, composition, meaning, it, is, rich, in, pyroxene, and, in, some, cases, olivine, both, of, which, are, mg, fe, rich, minerals, basalt, is, similar, in, composition, to, mantle, rocks, indicating, that, it, came, from, the, mantle, and, did, not, mix, with, continental, rocks, basalt, forms, in, areas, that, are, spreading, whereas, granite, forms, mostly, in, areas, that, are, colliding, since, both, rocks, are, found, in, the, deccan, plateau, it, indicates, two, different, environments, of, formation, the, volcanic, basalt, beds, of, the, deccan, were, laid, down, in, the, massive, deccan, traps, eruption, which, occurred, towards, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, between, 67, and, 66, million, years, ago, some, paleontologists, speculate, that, this, eruption, may, have, been, one, of, the, causes, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, layer, after, layer, was, formed, by, the, volcanic, activity, that, lasted, many, thousands, of, years, and, when, the, volcanoes, became, extinct, they, left, a, region, of, highlands, with, typically, vast, stretches, of, flat, areas, on, top, like, a, table, the, volcanic, hotspot, that, produced, the, deccan, traps, is, hypothesized, to, lie, under, the, present, day, island, of, r, union, in, the, indian, ocean, the, deccan, is, rich, in, minerals, primary, mineral, ores, found, in, this, region, are, mica, and, iron, ore, in, the, chhota, nagpur, region, and, diamonds, gold, and, other, metals, in, the, kollur, region, and, kolar, gold, fields, the, large, areas, of, remaining, forest, on, the, plateau, are, still, home, to, a, variety, of, grazing, animals, from, the, four, horned, antelope, tetracerus, quadricornis, chinkara, gazella, bennettii, and, blackbuck, antilope, cervicapra, to, the, gaur, bos, gaurus, a, r, and, wild, water, buffalo, bubalus, arnee, the, northern, deccan, is, inhabited, by, indo, aryan, peoples, major, groups, include, the, marathi, and, deccani, peoples, the, marathi, language, is, spoken, in, the, state, of, maharashtra, while, the, deccani, language, which, is, a, variety, of, hindustani, is, spoken, in, northern, telangana, northeastern, karnataka, and, southeastern, maharashtra, with, the, city, of, hyderabad, being, a, major, stronghold, of, the, language, the, southern, deccan, is, inhabited, by, dravidian, peoples, the, prominent, languages, spoken, by, these, groups, are, telugu, kannada, and, tamil, which, are, the, majority, languages, of, the, states, telangana, karnataka, and, tamil, nadu, respectively, the, deccan, produced, some, of, the, most, significant, dynasties, in, indian, history, such, as, the, vijayanagara, empire, the, rashtrakuta, dynasty, the, chola, dynasty, the, thagadur, dynasty, adhiyamans, pallavas, the, tondaiman, satavahana, dynasty,

established, are, the, growth, of, the, maurya, empire, 300, bce, and, after, that, the, deccan, was, ruled, by, the, satavahana, dynasty, which, protected, the, deccan, against, the, scythian, invaders, the, western, satraps, prominent, dynasties, of, this, time, include, the, cholas, 3rd, century, bce, to, 12th, century, ce, chalukyas, 6th, to, 12th, centuries, rashtrakutas, 753, 982,

inscription, at, nasik, refers, to, the, reign, of, an, abhira, prince, named, ishwarsena, son, of, shivadatta, after, the, collapse, of, the, satavahana, dynasty, the, deccan, was, ruled, by, the, vakataka, dynasty, from, the, third, century, to, fifth, century, from, the, sixth, to, eighth, century, the, deccan, was, ruled, by, the, chalukya, dynasty, which, produced, great, rulers, such, as, pulakesi, ii, who, defeated, the, north, india, emperor, harsha, and, vikramaditya, ii, whose, general, defeated, the, arab, invaders, in, the, eighth, century, from, the, eighth, to, tenth, century, the, rashtrakuta, dynasty, ruled, this, region, it, led, successful, military, campaigns, into, northern, india, and, was, described, by, arab, scholars, as, one, of, the, four, great, empires, of, the, world, in, the, tenth, century, the, western, chalukya, empire, which, produced, scholars, such, as, the, social, reformer, basavanna, vij, ne, vara, the, mathematician, bh, skara, ii, and, someshwara, iii, who, wrote, the, text, manasollasa, was, established, from, the, early, 11th, century, to, the, 12th, century, the, deccan, plateau, was, dominated, by, the, western, chalukya, empire, and, the, chola, dynasty, several, battles, were, fought, between, the, western, chalukya, empire, and, the, chola, dynasty, in, the, deccan, plateau, during, the, reigns, of, raja, raja, chola, i, rajendra, chola, i, jayasimha, ii, someshvara, i, and, vikramaditya, vi, and, kulottunga, i, in, 1294, alauddin, khalji, emperor, of, delhi, invaded, the, deccan, stormed, devagiri, and, reduced, the, yadava, rajas, of, maharashtra, to, the, position, of, tributary, princes, see, daulatabad, then, proceeded, southward, to, conquer, the, orugallu, carnatic, in, 1307, a, fresh, series, of, incursions, led, by, malik, kafur, began, in, response, to, unpaid, tributes, resulting, in, the, final, ruin, of, the, yadava, clan, and, in, 1338, the, conquest, of, the, deccan, was, completed, by, sultan, muhammad, bin, tughluq, the, imperial, hegemony, was, brief, as, soon, the, earlier, kingdoms, reverted, to, their, former, masters, these, defections, by, the, states, were, soon, followed, by, a, general, revolt, of, the, foreign, governors, resulting, in, the, establishment, in, 1347, of, the, independent, bahmani, dynasty, the, power, of, the, delhi, sultanate, evaporated, south, of, the, narmada, river, the, southern, deccan, came, under, the, rule, of, the, famous, vijayanagara, empire, which, reached, its, zenith, during, the, reign, of, emperor, krishnadevaraya, vijayanagara, empire, jostled, for, control, over, the, key, regions, in, the, deccan, as, territories, were, regularly, fought, out, for, against, the, bahmani, sultanate, krishnadevaraya, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, defeated, the, last, remnant, of, bahmani, sultanate, power, after, which, the, bahmani, sultanate, collapsed, when, the, bahmani, empire, dissolved, in, 1518, its, dominions, were, distributed, into, the, five, muslim, states, of, golkonda, bijapur, ahmednagar, bidar, and, berar, giving, rise, to, the, deccan, sultanates, south, of, these, the, hindu, state, of, carnatic, or, vijayanagar, still, survived, but, this, too, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, talikota, 1565, by, a, league, of, the, muslim, powers, berar, had, already, been, annexed, by, ahmednagar, in, 1572, and, bidar, was, absorbed, by, bijapur, in, 1619, mughal, interest, in, the, deccan, also, rose, at, this, time, partially, incorporated, into, the, empire, in, 1598, ahmadnagar, was, fully, annexed, in, 1636, bijapur, in, 1686, and, golkonda, in, 1687, in, 1645, shivaji, laid, the, foundation, of, the, maratha, empire, the, marathas, under, shivaji, directly, challenged, the, bijapur, sultanate, and, ultimately, the, mighty, mughal, empire, once, the, bijapur, sultanate, stopped, being, a, threat, to, the, maratha, empire, marathas, became, much, more, aggressive, and, began, to, frequently, raid, mughal, territory, these, raids, however, angered, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, and, by, 1680, he, moved, his, capital, from, delhi, to, aurangabad, in, deccan, to, conquer, maratha, held, territories, after, shivaji, died, his, son, sambhaji, defended, the, maratha, empire, from, the, mughal, onslaught, but, was, captured, by, the, mughals, and, executed, by, 1698, the, last, maratha, stronghold, at, jinji, fell, and, mughals, then, controlled, all, maratha, held, territories, in, 1707, emperor, aurangzeb, died, at, the, age, of, 89, which, allowed, the, marathas, to, reacquire, lost, territories, and, establish, authority, in, much, of, modern, maharashtra, after, the, death, of, chhatrapati, shahu, the, peshwas, became, the, de, facto, leaders, of, the, empire, from, 1749, to, 1761, while, shivaji, s, successors, continued, as, nominal, rulers, from, their, base, in, satara, the, marathas, kept, the, british, at, bay, during, the, 18th, century, by, 1760, with, the, defeat, of, the, nizam, in, the, deccan, maratha, power, had, reached, its, zenith, however, dissension, between, the, peshwa, and, their, sardars, army, commanders, saw, a, gradual, downfall, of, the, empire, leading, to, its, eventual, annexation, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1818, after, the, three, anglo, maratha, wars, a, few, years, later, aurangzeb, s, viceroy, in, ahmednagar, nizam, ul, mulk, established, the, seat, of, an, independent, government, at, hyderabad, in, 1724, mysore, was, ruled, by, hyder, ali, during, the, contests, for, power, which, ensued, from, about, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, between, the, powers, on, the, plateau, the, french, and, british, took, opposite, sides, after, a, brief, series, of, victories, the, interests, of, france, declined, and, a, new, empire, in, india, was, established, by, the, british, mysore, formed, one, of, their, earliest, conquests, in, the, deccan, tanjore, and, the, carnatic, were, soon, annexed, to, their, dominions, followed, by, the, peshwa, territories, in, 1818, in, british, india, the, plateau, was, largely, divided, between, the, presidencies, of, bombay, and, madras, the, two, largest, native, states, at, that, time, were, hyderabad, and, mysore, many, smaller, states, existed, at, the, time, including, kolhapur, and, sawantwari, after, independence, in, 1947, almost, all, native, states, were, incorporated, into, the, republic, of, india, the, indian, army, annexed, hyderabad, in, operation, polo, in, 1948, when, it, refused, to, join, in, 1956, the,
