centuries, christopher, columbus, was, the, first, european, to, see, the, islands, making, his, first, landfall, in, the, new, world, in, 1492, when, he, landed, on, the, island, of, san, salvador, later, the, spanish, shipped, the, native, lucayans, to, hispaniola, and, enslaved, them, there, after, which, the, bahama, islands, were, mostly, deserted, from, 1513, until, 1648, nearly, all, native, bahamians, having, been, forcibly, removed, for, enslavement, or, having, died, of, diseases, that, europeans, brought, with, them, from, europe, in, 1649, english, colonists, from, bermuda, known, as, the, eleutheran, adventurers, settled, on, the, island, of, eleuthera, the, bahamas, became, a, british, crown, colony, in, 1718, when, the, british, clamped, down, on, piracy, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, crown, resettled, thousands, of, american, loyalists, to, the, bahamas, they, took, enslaved, people, with, them, and, established, plantations, on, land, grants, enslaved, africans, and, their, descendants, constituted, the, majority, of, the, population, from, this, period, on, the, slave, trade, was, abolished, by, the, british, in, 1807, although, slavery, in, the, bahamas, was, not, abolished, until, 1834, the, bahamas, became, a, haven, of, manumission, for, african, slaves, from, outside, the, british, west, indies, in, 1818, africans, liberated, from, illegal, slave, ships, were, resettled, on, the, islands, by, the, royal, navy, while, some, north, american, slaves, and, seminoles, escaped, to, the, bahamas, from, florida, bahamians, were, even, known, to, recognise, the, freedom, of, enslaved, people, carried, by, the, ships, of, other, nations, which, reached, the, bahamas, today, black, bahamians, make, up, 90, of, the, population,

bahamas, has, the, fourteenth, largest, gross, domestic, product, per, capita, in, the, americas, its, economy, is, based, on, tourism, and, offshore, finance, the, name, bahamas, is, derived, from, the, lucayan, name, bahama, large, upper, middle, island, used, by, the, indigenous, ta, no, people, for, the, island, of, grand, bahama, tourist, guides, often, state, that, the, name, comes, from, the, spanish, baja, mar, shallow, sea, wolfgang, ahrens, of, york, university, argues, that, this, is, a, folk, etymology, alternatively, bahama, may, have, been, derived, from, guanahan, a, local, name, of, unclear, meaning, first, attested, on, the, c, 1523, turin, map, bahama, originally, referred, to, grand, bahama, alone, but, was, used, inclusively, in, english, by, 1670, toponymist, isaac, taylor, argues, that, the, name, was, derived, from, bimani, bimini, which, spaniards, in, haiti, identified, with, palombe, a, legendary, place, where, john, mandeville, s, travels, said, there, was, a, fountain, of, youth, the, bahamas, is, one, of, only, two, countries, whose, official, names, start, with, the, article, the, the, other, is, the, gambia, the, usage, likely, arose, because, the, name, also, refers, to, the, islands, a, geographical, feature, that, would, take, a, definite, article, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, bahamas, were, the, taino, people, who, moved, into, the, uninhabited, southern, islands, from, hispaniola, and, cuba, around, the, 800s, 1000s, ad, having, migrated, there, from, mainland, south, america, they, came, to, be, known, as, the, lucayan, people, an, estimated, 30, 000, lucayans, inhabited, the, bahamas, at, the, time, of, christopher, columbus, arrival, in, 1492, columbus, first, landfall, in, what, was, to, europeans, a, new, world, was, on, an, island, he, named, san, salvador, known, to, the, lucayans, as, guanahani, while, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, this, island, lay, within, the, bahamas, precisely, which, island, columbus, landed, on, is, a, matter, of, scholarly, debate, some, researchers, believe, the, site, to, be, present, day, san, salvador, island, formerly, known, as, watling, s, island, situated, in, the, southeastern, bahamas, whilst, an, alternative, theory, holds, that, columbus, landed, to, the, southeast, on, samana, cay, according, to, calculations, made, in, 1986, by, national, geographic, writer, and, editor, joseph, judge, based, on, columbus, log, on, the, landfall, island, columbus, made, first, contact, with, the, lucayans, and, exchanged, goods, with, them, claiming, the, islands, for, the, crown, of, castile, before, proceeding, to, explore, the, larger, isles, of, the, greater, antilles, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, theoretically, divided, the, new, territories, between, the, kingdom, of, castile, and, the, kingdom, of, portugal, placing, the, bahamas, in, the, spanish, sphere, however, they, did, little, to, press, their, claim, on, the, ground, the, spanish, did, however, exploit, the, native, lucayan, peoples, many, of, whom, were, enslaved, and, sent, to, hispaniola, for, use, as, forced, labour, the, slaves, suffered, harsh, conditions, and, most, died, from, contracting, diseases, to, which, they, had, no, immunity, half, of, the, taino, died, from, smallpox, alone, as, a, result, of, these, depredations, the, population, of, the, bahamas, was, severely, diminished, the, english, had, expressed, an, interest, in, the, bahamas, as, early, as, 1629, however, it, was, not, until, 1648, that, the, first, english, settlers, arrived, on, the, islands, known, as, the, eleutherian, adventurers, and, led, by, william, sayle, they, migrated, from, bermuda, seeking, greater, religious, freedom, these,

passed, near, the, eastern, portions, of, the, islands, in, 1999, hurricane, dorian, of, 2019, passed, over, the, archipelago, at, destructive, category, 5, strength, with, sustained, winds, of, 298, km, h, 185, mph, and, wind, gusts, up, to, 350, km, h, 220, mph, becoming, the, strongest, tropical, cyclone, on, record, to, impact, the, northwestern, islands, of, grand, bahama, and, great, abaco, it, was, generally, believed, that, the, bahamas, were, formed, approximately, 200, million, years, ago, when, pangaea, started, to, break, apart, in, current, times, it, endures, as, an, archipelago, containing, over, 700, islands, and, cays, fringed, around, different, coral, reefs, the, limestone, that, comprises, the, banks, has, been, accumulating, since, at, least, the, cretaceous, period, and, perhaps, as, early, as, the, jurassic, today, the, total, thickness, under, the, great, bahama, bank, is, over, 4, 5, kilometres, 2, 8, miles, as, the, limestone, was, deposited, in, shallow, water, the, only, way, to, explain, this, massive, column, is, to, estimate, that, the, entire, platform, has, subsided, under, its, own, weight, at, a, rate, of, roughly, 3, 6, centimetres, 2, inches, per, 1, 000, years, the, bahamas, is, part, of, the, lucayan, archipelago, which, continues, into, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, the, mouchoir, bank, the, silver, bank, and, the, navidad, bank, the, bahamas, platform, which, includes, the, bahamas, southern, florida, northern, cuba, the, turks, and, caicos, and, the, blake, plateau, formed, about, 150, ma, not, long, after, the, formation, of, the, north, atlantic, the, 6, 4, km, 4, 0, mi, thick, limestones, which, predominate, in, the, bahamas, date, back, to, the, cretaceous, these, limestones, would, have, been, deposited, in, shallow, seas, assumed, to, be, a, stretched, and, thinned, portion, of, the, north, american, continental, crust, sediments, were, forming, at, about, the, same, rate, as, the, crust, below, was, sinking, due, to, the, added, weight, thus, the, entire, area, consisted, of, a, large, marine, plain, with, some, islands, then, at, about, 80, ma, the, area, became, flooded, by, the, gulf, stream, this, resulted, in, the, drowning, of, the, blake, plateau, the, separation, of, the, bahamas, from, cuba, and, florida, the, separation, of, the, southeastern, bahamas, into, separate, banks, the, creation, of, the, cay, sal, bank, plus, the, little, and, great, bahama, banks, sedimentation, from, the, carbonate, factory, of, each, bank, or, atoll, continues, today, at, the, rate, of, about, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, per, kyr, coral, reefs, form, the, retaining, walls, of, these, atolls, within, which, oolites, and, pellets, form, coral, growth, was, greater, through, the, tertiary, until, the, start, of, the, ice, ages, and, hence, those, deposits, are, more, abundant, below, a, depth, of, 36, m, 118, ft, in, fact, an, ancient, extinct, reef, exists, half, a, kilometre, seaward, of, the, present, one, 30, m, 98, ft, below, sea, level, oolites, form, when, oceanic, water, penetrate, the, shallow, banks, increasing, the, temperature, about, 3, c, 5, 4, f, and, the, salinity, by, 0, 5,
