the, northwest, passage, nwp, is, the, sea, lane, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, through, the, arctic, ocean, along, the, northern, coast, of, north, america, via, waterways, through, the, arctic, archipelago, of, canada, the, eastern, route, along, the, arctic, coasts, of, norway, and, siberia, is, accordingly, called, the, northeast, passage, nep, the, various, islands, of, the, archipelago, are, separated, from, one, another, and, from, mainland, canada, by, a, series, of, arctic, waterways, collectively, known, as, the, northwest, passages, northwestern, passages, or, the, canadian, internal, waters, for, centuries, european, explorers, beginning, with, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, sought, a, navigable, passage, as, a, possible, trade, route, to, asia, but, were, blocked, by, north, central, and, south, america, by, ice, or, by, rough, waters, e, g, tierra, del, fuego, an, ice, bound, northern, route, was, discovered, in, 1850, by, the, irish, explorer, robert, mcclure, scotsman, john, rae, explored, a, more, southerly, area, in, 1854, through, which, norwegian, roald, amundsen, found, a, route, making, the, first, complete, passage, in, 1903, 1906, until, 2009, the, arctic, pack, ice, prevented, regular, marine, shipping, throughout, most, of, the, year, arctic, sea, ice, decline, linked, primarily, to, climate, change, has, rendered, the, waterways, more, navigable, for, ice, navigation, the, contested, sovereignty, claims, over, the, waters, may, complicate, future, shipping, through, the, region, the, canadian, government, maintains, that, the, northwestern, passages, are, part, of, canadian, internal, waters, but, the, united, states, claims, that, they, are, an, international, strait, and, transit, passage, allowing, free, and, unencumbered, passage, if, as, the, head, of, a, canadian, mining, company, claims, parts, of, the, eastern, end, of, the, passage, are, barely, 15, metres, 49, ft, deep, the, route, s, viability, as, a, euro, asian, shipping, route, is, reduced, in, 2016, a, chinese, shipping, line, expressed, a, desire, to, make, regular, voyages, of, cargo, ships, using, the, passage, to, the, eastern, united, states, and, europe, after, a, successful, passage, by, nordic, orion, of, 73, 500, tonnes, deadweight, tonnage, in, september, 2013, fully, laden, nordic, orion, sat, too, deep, in, the, water, to, sail, through, the, panama, canal, the, northwest, passage, has, three, sections, many, attempts, were, made, to, find, a, salt, water, exit, west, from, hudson, bay, but, the, fury, and, hecla, strait, in, the, far, north, is, blocked, by, ice, the, eastern, entrance, and, main, axis, of, the, northwest, passage, the, parry, channel, was, found, in, 1819, the, approach, from, the, west, through, bering, strait, is, impractical, because, of, the, need, to, sail, around, ice, near, point, barrow, east, of, point, barrow, the, coast, is, fairly, clear, in, summer, this, area, was, mapped, in, pieces, from, overland, in, 1821, 1839, this, leaves, the, large, rectangle, north, of, the, coast, south, of, parry, channel, and, west, of, baffin, island, this, area, was, mostly, mapped, in, 1848, 1854, by, ships, looking, for, franklin, s, lost, expedition, the, first, crossing, was, made, by, roald, amundsen, in, 1903, 1906, he, used, a, small, ship, and, hugged, the, coast, before, the, little, ice, age, late, middle, ages, to, the, 19th, century, norwegian, vikings, sailed, as, far, north, and, west, as, ellesmere, island, skraeling, island, and, ruin, island, for, hunting, expeditions, and, trading, with, the, inuit, and, people, of, the, dorset, culture, who, inhabited, the, region, between, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, and, the, 20th, century, colonial, powers, from, europe, dispatched, explorers, to, discover, a, commercial, sea, route, north, and, west, around, north, america, the, northwest, passage, represented, a, new, route, to, the, established, trading, nations, of, asia, england, called, the, hypothetical, northern, route, the, northwest, passage, the, desire, to, establish, such, a, route, motivated, much, of, the, european, exploration, of, both, coasts, of, north, america, also, known, as, the, new, world, when, it, became, apparent, that, there, was, no, route, through, the, heart, of, the, continent, attention, turned, to, the, possibility, of, a, passage, through, northern, waters, there, was, a, lack, of, scientific, knowledge, about, conditions, for, instance, some, people, believed, that, seawater, was, incapable, of, freezing, as, late, as, the, mid, 18th, century, captain, james, cook, had, reported, that, antarctic, icebergs, had, yielded, fresh, water, seemingly, confirming, the, hypothesis, explorers, thought, that, an, open, polar, sea, close, to, the, north, pole, must, exist, the, belief, that, a, route, lay, to, the, far, north, persisted, for, several, centuries, and, led, to, numerous, expeditions, into, the, arctic, many, ended, in, disaster, including, that, by, sir, john, franklin, in, 1845, while, searching, for, him, the, mcclure, arctic, expedition, discovered, the, northwest, passage, in, 1850, in, 1906, the, norwegian, explorer, roald, amundsen, was, the, first, to, complete, the, passage, solely, by, ship, from, greenland, to, alaska, in, the, sloop, gj, a, since, that, date, several, fortified, ships, have, made, the, journey, from, east, to, west, the, direction, of, most, early, exploration, attempts, expeditions, entered, the, passage, from, the, atlantic, ocean, via, the, davis, strait, and, through, baffin, bay, both, of, which, are, in, canada, five, to, seven, routes, have, been, taken, through, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, via, the, mcclure, strait, dease, strait, and, the, prince, of, wales, strait, but, not, all, of, them, are, suitable, for, larger, ships, from, there, ships, passed, through, westward, through, the, beaufort, sea, and, the, chukchi, sea, and, then, southwards, through, the, bering, strait, separating, russia, and, alaska, into, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, 21st, century, major, changes, to, the, ice, pack, due, to, climate, change, have, stirred, speculation, that, the, passage, may, become, clear, enough, of, ice, to, permit, safe, commercial, shipping, for, at, least, part, of, the, year, on, august, 21, 2007, the, northwest, passage, became, open, to, ships, without, the, need, of, an, icebreaker, according, to, nalan, koc, of, the, norwegian, polar, institute, this, was, the, first, time, the, passage, has, been, clear, since, they, began, keeping, records, in, 1972, the, northwest, passage, opened, again, on, august, 25, 2008, it, is, usually, reported, that, ocean, thawing, will, open, up, the, northwest, passage, and, the, northern, sea, route, for, various, kind, of, ships, making, it, possible, to, sail, around, the, arctic, ice, cap, and, possibly, cutting, thousands, of, miles, off, shipping, routes, warning, that, the, nasa, satellite, images, suggested, that, the, arctic, had, entered, a, death, spiral, caused, by, climate, change, professor, mark, serreze, a, sea, ice, specialist, at, the, u, s, national, snow, and, ice, data, center, nsidc, said, the, passages, are, open, it, s, a, historic, event, we, are, going, to, see, this, more, and, more, as, the, years, go, by, however, some, thick, sections, of, ice, will, remain, hard, to, melt, in, the, shorter, term, drifting, and, persistence, of, large, chunks, of, ice, especially, in, springtime, can, be, problematic, as, they, can, clog, entire, straits, or, severely, damage, a, ship, s, hull, cargo, routes, may, thus, be, slow, and, uncertain, depending, on, prevailing, conditions, and, the, ability, to, predict, them, because, much, containerized, traffic, operates, in, a, just, in, time, mode, which, does, not, tolerate, delays, well, and, because, of, the, relative, isolation, of, the, passage, which, impedes, shipping, companies, from, optimizing, their, operations, by, grouping, multiple, stopovers, on, the, same, itinerary, the, northwest, passage, and, other, arctic, routes, are, not, always, seen, as, promising, shipping, lanes, by, industry, insiders, at, least, for, the, time, being, the, uncertainty, related, to, physical, damage, to, ships, is, also, thought, to, translate, into, higher, insurance, premiums, especially, because, of, the, technical, challenges, posed, by, arctic, navigation, as, of, 2014, only, 12, percent, of, canada, s, arctic, waters, have, been, charted, to, modern, standards, the, beluga, group, of, bremen, germany, sent, the, first, western, commercial, vessels, through, the, northern, sea, route, northeast, passage, in, 2009, canada, s, prime, minister, stephen, harper, announced, that, ships, entering, the, north, west, passage, should, first, report, to, his, government, the, first, commercial, cargo, ship, to, have, sailed, through, the, northwest, passage, was, ss, manhattan, in, august, 1969, ss, manhattan, of, 115, 000, deadweight, tonnage, was, the, largest, commercial, vessel, ever, to, navigate, the, northwest, passage, the, largest, passenger, ship, to, navigate, the, northwest, passage, was, the, cruise, liner, crystal, serenity, of, gross, tonnage, 69, 000, starting, on, august, 10, 2016, the, ship, sailed, from, vancouver, to, new, york, city, with, 1, 500, passengers, and, crew, taking, 28, days, in, 2018, two, of, the, freighters, leaving, baffinland, s, port, in, the, milne, inlet, on, baffin, island, s, north, shore, were, bound, for, ports, in, asia, those, freighters, did, not, sail, west, through, the, remainder, of, the, northwest, passage, they, sailed, east, rounded, the, tip, of, greenland, and, transited, russia, s, northern, sea, route, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, northwestern, passages, as, follows, on, the, west, the, eastern, limit, of, beaufort, sea, from, lands, end, through, the, southwest, coast, of, prince, patrick, island, to, griffiths, point, thence, a, line, to,

ellesmere, island, skraeling, island, for, hunting, expeditions, and, trading, with, inuit, groups, the, subsequent, arrival, of, the, little, ice, age, is, thought, to, have, been, one, of, the, reasons, that, european, seafaring, into, the, northwest, passage, ceased, until, the, late, 15th, century, in, 1539, hern, n, cort, s, commissioned, francisco, de, ulloa, to, sail, along, the, baja, california, peninsula, on, the, western, coast, of, north, america, ulloa, concluded, that, the, gulf, of, california, was, the, southernmost, section, of, a, strait, supposedly, linking, the, pacific, with, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, his, voyage, perpetuated, the, notion, of, the, island, of, california, and, saw, the, beginning, of, a, search, for, the, strait, of, ani, n, the, strait, probably, took, its, name, from, ania, a, chinese, province, mentioned, in, a, 1559, edition, of, marco, polo, s, book, it, first, appears, on, a, map, issued, by, italian, cartographer, giacomo, gastaldi, about, 1562, five, years, later, bolognino, zaltieri, issued, a, map, showing, a, narrow, and, crooked, strait, of, anian, separating, asia, from, the, americas, the, strait, grew, in, european, imagination, as, an, easy, sea, lane, linking, europe, with, the, residence, of, khagan, the, great, khan, in, cathay, northern, china, cartographers, and, seamen, tried, to, demonstrate, its, reality, sir, francis, drake, sought, the, western, entrance, in, 1579, the, greek, pilot, juan, de, fuca, sailing, from, acapulco, in, mexico, under, the, flag, of, the, spanish, crown, claimed, he, had, sailed, the, strait, from, the, pacific, to, the, north, sea, and, back, in, 1592, the, spaniard, bartholomew, de, fonte, claimed, to, have, sailed, from, hudson, bay, to, the, pacific, via, the, strait, in, 1640, the, first, recorded, attempt, to, discover, the, northwest, passage, was, the, east, west, voyage, of, john, cabot, in, 1497, sent, by, henry, vii, in, search, of, a, direct, route, to, the, orient, in, 1524, charles, v, sent, est, v, o, gomes, to, find, a, northern, atlantic, passage, to, the, spice, islands, an, english, expedition, was, launched, in, 1576, by, martin, frobisher, who, took, three, trips, west, to, what, is, now, the, canadian, arctic, in, order, to, find, the, passage, frobisher, bay, which, he, first, charted, is, named, after, him, as, part, of, another, expedition, in, july, 1583, sir, humphrey, gilbert, who, had, written, a, treatise, on, the, discovery, of, the, passage, and, was, a, backer, of, frobisher, claimed, the, territory, of, newfoundland, for, the, english, crown, on, august, 8, 1585, the, english, explorer, john, davis, entered, cumberland, sound, baffin, island, the, major, rivers, on, the, east, coast, were, also, explored, in, case, they, could, lead, to, a, transcontinental, passage, jacques, cartier, s, explorations, of, the, saint, lawrence, river, in, 1535, were, initiated, in, hope, of, finding, a, way, through, the, continent, cartier, became, persuaded, that, the, st, lawrence, was, the, passage, when, he, found, the, way, blocked, by, rapids, at, what, is, now, montreal, he, was, so, certain, that, these, rapids, were, all, that, was, keeping, him, from, china, in, french, la, chine, that, he, named, the, rapids, for, china, samuel, de, champlain, renamed, them, sault, saint, louis, in, 1611, but, the, name, was, changed, to, lachine, rapids, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1602, george, weymouth, became, the, first, european, to, explore, what, would, later, be, called, hudson, strait, when, he, sailed, discovery, 300, nautical, miles, 560, km, into, the, strait, weymouth, s, expedition, to, find, the, northwest, passage, was, funded, jointly, by, the, british, east, india, company, and, the, muscovy, company, discovery, was, the, same, ship, used, by, henry, hudson, on, his, final, voyage, john, knight, employed, by, the, british, east, india, company, and, the, muscovy, company, set, out, in, 1606, to, follow, up, on, weymouth, s, discoveries, and, find, the, northwest, passage, after, his, ship, ran, aground, and, was, nearly, crushed, by, ice, knight, disappeared, while, searching, for, a, better, anchorage, in, 1609, henry, hudson, sailed, up, what, is, now, called, the, hudson, river, in, search, of, the, passage, encouraged, by, the, saltiness, of, the, water, in, the, estuary, he, reached, present, day, albany, new, york, before, giving, up, on, september, 14, 1609, hudson, entered, the, tappan, zee, while, sailing, upstream, from, new, york, harbor, at, first, hudson, believed, the, widening, of, the, river, indicated, that, he, had, found, the, northwest, passage, he, proceeded, upstream, as, far, as, present, day, troy, before, concluding, that, no, such, strait, existed, there, he, later, explored, the, arctic, and, hudson, bay, in, 1611, while, in, james, bay, hudson, s, crew, mutinied, they, set, hudson, and, his, teenage, son, john, along, with, seven, sick, infirm, or, loyal, crewmen, adrift, in, a, small, open, boat, he, was, never, seen, again, a, mission, was, sent, out, in, 1612, again, in, discovery, commanded, by, sir, thomas, button, to, find, henry, hudson, and, continue, through, the, northwest, passage, after, failing, to, find, hudson, and, exploring, the, west, coast, of, hudson, bay, button, returned, home, due, to, illness, in, the, crew, in, 1614, william, gibbons, attempted, to, find, the, passage, but, was, turned, back, by, ice, the, next, year, 1615, robert, bylot, a, survivor, of, hudson, s, crew, returned, to, hudson, strait, in, discovery, but, was, turned, back, by, ice, bylot, tried, again, in, 1616, with, william, baffin, they, sailed, as, far, as, lancaster, sound, and, reached, 77, 45, north, latitude, a, record, which, stood, for, 236, years, before, being, blocked, by, ice, on, may, 9, 1619, under, the, auspices, of, king, christian, iv, of, denmark, norway, jens, munk, set, out, with, 65, men, and, the, king, s, two, ships, einh, rningen, unicorn, a, small, frigate, and, lamprenen, lamprey, a, sloop, which, were, outfitted, under, his, own, supervision, his, mission, was, to, discover, the, northwest, passage, to, the, indies, and, china, munk, penetrated, davis, strait, as, far, north, as, 69, found, frobisher, bay, and, then, spent, almost, a, month, fighting, his, way, through, hudson, strait, in, september, 1619, he, found, the, entrance, to, hudson, bay, and, spent, the, winter, near, the, mouth, of, the, churchill, river, cold, famine, and, scurvy, destroyed, so, many, of, his, men, that, only, he, and, two, other, men, survived, with, these, men, he, sailed, for, home, with, lamprey, on, july, 16, 1620, reaching, bergen, norway, on, september, 20, 1620, ren, robert, cavelier, sieur, de, la, salle, built, the, sailing, ship, le, griffon, in, his, quest, to, find, the, northwest, passage, via, the, upper, great, lakes, he, made, his, way, across, lake, erie, and, lake, huron, making, port, on, mackinac, island, before, landing, at, washington, island, at, the, mouth, of, green, bay, to, trade, for, furs, with, pottawatomie, indians, la, salle, stayed, behind, while, the, ship, sailed, back, to, mackinac, with, the, furs, le, griffon, disappeared, in, 1679, on, the, return, trip, of, her, maiden, voyage, in, the, spring, of, 1682, la, salle, made, his, famous, voyage, down, the, mississippi, river, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, la, salle, led, an, expedition, from, france, in, 1684, to, establish, a, french, colony, on, the, gulf, of, mexico, he, was, murdered, by, his, followers, in, 1687, henry, ellis, born, in, ireland, was, part, of, a, company, aiming, to, discover, the, northwest, passage, in, may, 1746, after, the, difficult, extinction, of, a, fire, on, board, the, ship, he, sailed, to, greenland, where, he, traded, goods, with, the, inuit, peoples, on, july, 8, 1746, he, crossed, to, the, town, of, fort, nelson, and, spent, the, summer, on, the, hayes, river, he, renewed, his, efforts, in, june, 1747, without, success, before, returning, to, england, in, 1772, the, english, fur, trader, samuel, hearne, travelled, overland, northwest, from, hudson, bay, to, the, arctic, ocean, thereby, proving, that, there, was, no, strait, connecting, hudson, bay, to, the, pacific, ocean, most, northwest, passage, expeditions, originated, in, europe, or, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, seeking, to, traverse, the, passage, in, the, westbound, direction, some, progress, was, made, in, exploring, the, western, reaches, of, the, imagined, passage, in, 1728, vitus, bering, a, danish, navy, officer, in, russian, service, used, the, strait, first, discovered, by, semyon, dezhnyov, in, 1648, but, later, accredited, to, and, named, after, bering, the, bering, strait, he, concluded, that, north, america, and, russia, were, separate, land, masses, by, sailing, between, them, in, 1741, with, lieutenant, aleksei, chirikov, he, explored, seeking, further, lands, beyond, siberia, while, they, were, separated, chirikov, discovered, several, of, the, aleutian, islands, while, bering, charted, the, alaskan, region, his, ship, was, wrecked, off, the, kamchatka, peninsula, as, many, of, his, crew, were, disabled, by, scurvy, the, spanish, made, several, voyages, to, the, northwest, coast, of, north, america, during, the, late, 18th, century, determining, whether, a, northwest, passage, existed, was, one, of, the, motives, for, their, efforts, among, the, voyages, that, involved, careful, searches, for, a, passage, included, the, 1775, and, 1779, voyages, of, juan, francisco, de, la, bodega, y, quadra, the, journal, of, francisco, antonio, mourelle, who, served, as, quadra, s, second, in, command, in, 1775, fell, into, english, hands, it, was, translated, and, published, in, london, stimulating, exploration, captain, james, cook, made, use, of, the, journal, during, his, explorations, of, the, region, in, 1791, alessandro, malaspina, sailed, to, yakutat, bay, alaska, which, was, rumoured, to, be, a, passage, in, 1790, and, 1791, francisco, de, eliza, led, several, exploring, voyages, into, the, strait, of, juan, de, fuca, searching, for, a, possible, northwest, passage, and, finding, the, strait, of, georgia, to, fully, explore, this, new, inland, sea, an, expedition, under, dionisio, alcal, galiano, was, sent, in, 1792, he, was, explicitly, ordered, to, explore, all, channels, that, might, turn, out, to, be, a, northwest, passage, in, 1776, captain, james, cook, was, dispatched, by, the, admiralty, in, great, britain, on, an, expedition, to, explore, the, passage, a, 1745, act, when, extended, in, 1775, promised, a, 20, 000, prize, for, whoever, discovered, the, passage, initially, the, admiralty, had, wanted, charles, clerke, to, lead, the, expedition, with, cook, in, retirement, following, his, exploits, in, the, pacific, acting, as, a, consultant, however, cook, had, researched, bering, s, expeditions, and, the, admiralty, ultimately, placed, their, faith, in, the, veteran, explorer, to, lead, with, clerke, accompanying, him, after, journeying, through, the, pacific, to, make, an, attempt, from, the, west, cook, began, at, nootka, sound, in, april, 1778, he, headed, north, along, the, coastline, charting, the, lands, and, searching, for, the, regions, sailed, by, the, russians, 40, years, previously, the, admiralty, s, orders, had, commanded, the, expedition, to, ignore, all, inlets, and, rivers, until, they, reached, a, latitude, of, 65, n, cook, however, failed, to, make, any, progress, in, sighting, a, northwestern, passage, various, officers, on, the, expedition, including, william, bligh, george, vancouver, and, john, gore, thought, the, existence, of, a, route, was, improbable, before, reaching, 65, n, they, found, the, coastline, pushing, them, further, south, but, gore, convinced, cook, to, sail, on, into, the, cook, inlet, in, the, hope, of, finding, the, route, they, continued, to, the, limits, of, the, alaskan, peninsula, and, the, start, of, the, 1, 200, mi, 1, 900, km, chain, of, aleutian, islands, despite, reaching, 70, n, they, encountered, nothing, but, icebergs, from, 1792, to, 1794, the, vancouver, expedition, led, by, george, vancouver, who, had, previously, accompanied, cook, surveyed, in, detail, all, the, passages, from, the, northwest, coast, he, confirmed, that, there, was, no, such, passage, south, of, the, bering, strait, this, conclusion, was, supported, by, the, evidence, of, alexander, mackenzie, who, explored, the, arctic, and, pacific, oceans, in, 1793, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, some, parts, of, the, northwest, passage, north, of, the, bering, strait, were, explored, separately, by, many, expeditions, including, those, by, john, ross, elisha, kent, kane, william, edward, parry, and, james, clark, ross, overland, expeditions, were, also, led, by, john, franklin, george, back, peter, warren, dease, thomas, simpson, and, john, rae, in, 1826, frederick, william, beechey, explored, the, north, coast, of, alaska, discovering, point, barrow, sir, robert, mcclure, was, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, northwest, passage, in, 1851, when, he, looked, across, mcclure, strait, from, banks, island, and, viewed, melville, island, however, this, strait, was, not, navigable, to, ships, at, that, time, the, only, usable, route, linking, the, entrances, of, lancaster, sound, and, dolphin, and, union, strait, was, discovered, by, john, rae, in, 1854, in, 1845, a, lavishly, equipped, two, ship, expedition, led, by, sir, john, franklin, sailed, to, the, canadian, arctic, to, chart, the, last, unknown, swaths, of, the, northwest, passage, confidence, was, high, as, they, estimated, there, was, less, than, 500, km, 310, mi, remaining, of, unexplored, arctic, mainland, coast, when, the, ships, failed, to, return, relief, expeditions, and, search, parties, explored, the, canadian, arctic, which, resulted, in, a, thorough, charting, of, the, region, along, with, a, possible, passage, many, artifacts, from, the, expedition, were, found, over, the, next, century, and, a, half, including, notes, that, the, ships, were, ice, locked, in, 1846, near, king, william, island, about, halfway, through, the, passage, and, unable, to, break, free, records, showed, franklin, died, in, 1847, and, captain, francis, rawdon, moira, crozier, took, over, command, in, 1848, the, expedition, abandoned, the, two, ships, and, its, members, tried, to, escape, south, across, the, tundra, by, sledge, although, some, of, the, crew, may, have, survived, into, the, early, 1850s, no, evidence, has, ever, been, found, of, any, survivors, in, 1853, explorer, john, rae, was, told, by, local, inuit, about, the, disastrous, fate, of, franklin, s, expedition, but, his, reports, were, not, welcomed, in, britain, on, account, of, his, reports, of, cannibalism, amongst, the, surviving, crews, starvation, exposure, and, scurvy, all, contributed, to, the, men, s, deaths, in, 1981, owen, beattie, an, anthropologist, from, the, university, of, alberta, examined, remains, from, sites, associated, with, the, expedition, this, led, to, further, investigations, and, the, examination, of, tissue, and, bone, from, the, frozen, bodies, of, three, seamen, john, torrington, william, braine, and, john, hartnell, exhumed, from, the, permafrost, of, beechey, island, laboratory, tests, revealed, high, concentrations, of, lead, in, all, three, the, expedition, carried, 8, 000, tins, of, food, sealed, with, a, lead, based, solder, another, researcher, has, suggested, botulism, caused, deaths, among, crew, members, evidence, from, 1996, that, confirms, reports, first, made, by, john, rae, in, 1854, based, on, inuit, accounts, suggests, that, the, last, of, the, crew, may, have, resorted, to, cannibalism, of, deceased, members, in, an, effort, to, survive, during, the, search, for, franklin, commander, robert, mcclure, and, his, crew, in, hms, investigator, traversed, the, northwest, passage, from, west, to, east, in, the, years, 1850, to, 1854, partly, by, ship, and, partly, by, sledge, mcclure, started, out, from, england, in, december, 1849, sailed, the, atlantic, ocean, south, to, cape, horn, and, entered, the, pacific, ocean, he, sailed, the, pacific, north, and, passed, through, the, bering, strait, turning, east, at, that, point, and, reaching, banks, island, mcclure, s, ship, was, trapped, in, the, ice, for, three, winters, near, banks, island, at, the, western, end, of, viscount, melville, sound, finally, mcclure, and, his, crew, who, were, by, that, time, dying, of, starvation, were, found, by, searchers, who, had, travelled, by, sledge, over, the, ice, from, a, ship, of, sir, edward, belcher, s, expedition, they, rescued, mcclure, and, his, crew, returning, with, them, to, belcher, s, ships, which, had, entered, the, sound, from, the, east, mcclure, and, his, crew, returned, to, england, in, 1854, on, one, of, belcher, s, ships, they, were, the, first, people, known, to, circumnavigate, the, americas, and, to, discover, and, transit, the, northwest, passage, albeit, by, ship, and, by, sledge, over, the, ice, both, mcclure, and, his, ship, were, found, by, a, party, from, hms, resolute, one, of, belcher, s, ships, so, his, sledge, journey, was, relatively, short, this, was, an, astonishing, feat, for, that, day, and, age, and, mcclure, was, knighted, and, promoted, in, rank, he, was, made, rear, admiral, in, 1867, both, he, and, his, crew, also, shared, 10, 000, awarded, them, by, the, british, parliament, in, july, 2010, canadian, archaeologists, found, his, ship, hms, investigator, fairly, intact, but, sunk, about, 8, m, 26, ft, below, the, surface, the, expeditions, by, franklin, and, mcclure, were, in, the, tradition, of, british, exploration, well, funded, ship, expeditions, using, modern, technology, and, usually, including, british, naval, personnel, by, contrast, john, rae, was, an, employee, of, the, hudson, s, bay, company, which, operated, a, far, flung, trade, network, and, drove, exploration, of, the, canadian, north, they, adopted, a, pragmatic, approach, and, tended, to, be, land, based, while, franklin, and, mcclure, tried, to, explore, the, passage, by, sea, rae, explored, by, land, he, used, dog, sleds, and, techniques, of, surviving, in, the, environment, which, he, had, learned, from, the, native, inuit, the, franklin, and, mcclure, expeditions, each, employed, hundreds, of, personnel, and, multiple, ships, john, rae, s, expeditions, included, fewer, than, ten, people, and, succeeded, rae, was, also, the, explorer, with, the, best, safety, record, having, lost, only, one, man, in, years, of, traversing, arctic, lands, in, 1854, rae, returned, to, the, cities, with, information, from, the, inuit, about, the, disastrous, fate, of, the, franklin, expedition, the, first, explorer, to, conquer, the, northwest, passage, solely, by, ship, was, the, norwegian, explorer, roald, amundsen, in, a, three, year, journey, between, 1903, and, 1906, amundsen, explored, the, passage, with, a, crew, of, six, amundsen, who, had, sailed, to, escape, creditors, seeking, to, stop, the, expedition, completed, the, voyage, in, the, converted, 45, net, register, tonnage, 4, 500, cu, ft, or, 130, m, 3, herring, boat, gj, a, gj, a, was, much, smaller, than, vessels, used, by, other, arctic, expeditions, and, had, a, shallow, draft, amundsen, intended, to, hug, the, shore, live, off, the, limited, resources, of, the, land, and, sea, through, which, he, was, to, travel, and, had, determined, that, he, needed, to, have, a, tiny, crew, to, make, this, work, trying, to, support, much, larger, crews, had, contributed, to, the, catastrophic, failure, of, john, franklin, s, expedition, fifty, years, previously, losing, two, ships, and, their, crews, the, ship, s, shallow, draft, was, intended, to, help, her, traverse, the, shoals, of, the, arctic, straits, amundsen, set, out, from, kristiania, oslo, in, june, 1903, and, was, west, of, the, boothia, peninsula, by, late, september, gj, a, was, put, into, a, natural, harbour, on, the, south, shore, of, king, william, island, by, october, 3, she, was, iced, in, there, the, expedition, remained, for, nearly, two, years, with, the, expedition, members, learning, from, the, local, inuit, and, undertaking, measurements, to, determine, the, location, of, the, north, magnetic, pole, the, harbour, now, known, as, gjoa, haven, later, developed, as, the, only, permanent, settlement, on, the, island, after, completing, the, northwest, passage, portion, of, this, trip, and, having, anchored, near, herschel, island, amundsen, skied, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, to, the, city, of, eagle, alaska, he, sent, a, telegram, announcing, his, success, and, skied, the, return, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, to, rejoin, his, companions, although, his, chosen, east, west, route, via, the, rae, strait, contained, young, ice, and, thus, was, navigable, some, of, the, waterways, were, extremely, shallow, 3, ft, 0, 91, m, deep, making, the, route, commercially, impractical, the, first, traversal, of, the, northwest, passage, via, dog, sled, was, accomplished, by, greenlander, knud, rasmussen, while, on, the, fifth, thule, expedition, 1921, 1924, rasmussen, and, two, greenland, inuit, travelled, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, over, the, course, of, 16, months, via, dog, sled, canadian, royal, canadian, mounted, police, officer, henry, larsen, was, the, second, to, sail, the, passage, crossing, west, to, east, leaving, vancouver, on, june, 23, 1940, and, arriving, at, halifax, on, october, 11, 1942, more, than, once, on, this, trip, he, was, uncertain, whether, st, roch, a, royal, canadian, mounted, police, ice, fortified, schooner, would, survive, the, pressures, of, the, sea, ice, at, one, point, larsen, wondered, if, we, had, come, this, far, only, to, be, crushed, like, a, nut, on, a, shoal, and, then, buried, by, the, ice, the, ship, and, all, but, one, of, her, crew, survived, the, winter, on, boothia, peninsula, each, of, the, men, on, the, trip, was, awarded, a, medal, by, canada, s, sovereign, king, george, vi, in, recognition, of, this, feat, of, arctic, navigation, later, in, 1944, larsen, s, return, trip, was, far, more, swift, than, his, first, he, made, the, trip, in, 86, days, to, sail, back, from, halifax, nova, scotia, to, vancouver, british, columbia, he, set, a, record, for, traversing, the, route,

on, august, 25, 2023, and, charged, with, violations, of, the, migratory, birds, convention, act, and, the, canada, national, parks, act, they, were, due, to, appear, in, court, on, january, 8, 2024, charges, included, possessing, a, firearm, in, a, park, disturbing, wildlife, in, a, park, unlawfully, entering, a, park, without, registering, unlawfully, entering, a, restricted, area, in, a, park, camping, on, public, land, in, a, park, and, possession, of, a, firearm, in, a, migratory, bird, sanctuary, however, on, may, 6, 2024, 39, of, the, 45, charges, were, dropped, it, is, unclear, at, this, time, the, disposition, of, the, remaining, 6, charges, a, freedom, of, information, request, has, been, submitted, to, determine, the, final, disposition, of, charges, the, crown, the, canadian, government, classifies, the, waters, of, the, northwest, passage, in, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, as, internal, waters, of, canada, as, per, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, and, by, the, precedent, in, the, drawing, of, baselines, for, other, archipelagos, giving, canada, the, right, to, bar, transit, through, these, waters, some, maritime, nations, notably, the, united, states, claim, these, waters, to, be, an, international, strait, where, foreign, vessels, have, the, right, of, transit, passage, in, such, a, regime, canada, would, have, the, right, to, enact, fishing, and, environmental, regulation, and, fiscal, and, smuggling, laws, as, well, as, laws, intended, for, the, safety, of, shipping, but, not, the, right, to, close, the, passage, while, canada, is, a, party, to, the, 1982, convention, the, united, states, has, not, ratified, it, the, dispute, between, canada, and, the, united, states, arose, in, 1969, with, the, trip, of, the, u, s, oil, tanker, ss, manhattan, through, the, arctic, archipelago, the, prospect, of, more, american, traffic, headed, to, the, prudhoe, bay, oil, field, made, the, canadian, government, realize, that, political, action, was, required, if, the, passage, s, deep, waters, become, completely, ice, free, in, summer, months, they, will, be, particularly, enticing, for, supertankers, that, are, too, big, to, pass, through, the, panama, canal, and, must, otherwise, navigate, around, the, tip, of, south, america, in, 1985, the, u, s, coast, guard, icebreaker, polar, sea, passed, through, from, greenland, to, alaska, the, ship, submitted, to, inspection, by, the, canadian, coast, guard, before, passing, through, but, the, event, infuriated, the, canadian, public, and, resulted, in, a, diplomatic, incident, the, united, states, government, when, asked, by, a, canadian, reporter, indicated, that, they, did, not, ask, for, permission, as, they, insist, that, the, waters, were, an, international, strait, the, canadian, government, issued, a, declaration, in, 1986, reaffirming, canadian, rights, to, the, waters, the, united, states, refused, to, recognize, the, canadian, claim, in, 1988, the, governments, of, canada, and, the, united, states, signed, an, agreement, arctic, cooperation, that, resolved, the, practical, issue, without, solving, the, sovereignty, questions, under, the, law, of, the, sea, ships, engaged, in, transit, passage, are, not, permitted, to, engage, in, research, the, agreement, states, that, all, u, s, coast, guard, and, navy, vessels, are, engaged, in, research, and, so, would, require, permission, from, the, government, of, canada, to, pass, through, however, in, late, 2005, it, was, reported, that, u, s, nuclear, submarines, had, travelled, unannounced, through, canadian, arctic, waters, breaking, the, arctic, cooperation, agreement, and, sparking, outrage, in, canada, in, his, first, news, conference, after, the, 2006, federal, election, prime, minister, designate, stephen, harper, contested, an, earlier, statement, made, by, the, u, s, ambassador, that, arctic, waters, were, international, stating, the, canadian, government, s, intention, to, enforce, its, sovereignty, there, the, allegations, arose, after, the, u, s, navy, released, photographs, of, uss, charlotte, surfaced, at, the, north, pole, on, april, 9, 2006, canada, s, joint, task, force, north, declared, that, the, canadian, forces, will, no, longer, refer, to, the, region, as, the, northwest, passage, but, as, the, canadian, internal, waters, the, declaration, came, after, the, successful, completion, of, operation, nunalivut, inuktitut, for, the, land, is, ours, which, was, an, expedition, into, the, region, by, five, military, patrols, in, 2006, a, report, prepared, by, the, staff, of, the, parliamentary, information, and, research, service, of, canada, suggested, that, because, of, the, september, 11, attacks, the, united, states, might, be, less, interested, in, pursuing, the, international, waterways, claim, in, the, interests, of, having, a, more, secure, north, american, perimeter, this, report, was, based, on, an, earlier, paper, the, northwest, passage, shipping, channel, is, canada, s, sovereignty, really, floating, away, by, andrea, charron, given, to, the, 2004, canadian, defence, and, foreign, affairs, institute, symposium, later, in, 2006, former, united, states, ambassador, to, canada, paul, cellucci, agreed, with, this, position, however, the, succeeding, ambassador, david, wilkins, stated, that, the, northwest, passage, was, in, international, waters, on, july, 9, 2007, prime, minister, harper, announced, the, establishment, of, a, deep, water, port, in, the, far, north, in, the, press, release, harper, said, canada, has, a, choice, when, it, comes, to, defending, our, sovereignty, over, the, arctic, we, either, use, it, or, lose, it, and, make, no, mistake, this, government, intends, to, use, it, because, canada, s, arctic, is, central, to, our, national, identity, as, a, northern, nation, it, is, part, of, our, history, and, it, represents, the, tremendous, potential, of, our, future, on, july, 10, 2007, rear, admiral, timothy, mcgee, of, the, u, s, navy, and, rear, admiral, brian, salerno, of, the, u, s, coast, guard, announced, that, the, united, states, would, be, increasing, its, ability, to, patrol, the, arctic, in, june, 2019, the, u, s, state, department, spokesperson, morgan, ortagus, said, we, view, canada, s, claim, that, the, waters, of, the, northwest, passage, are, internal, waters, of, canada, as, inconsistent, with, international, law, despite, historical, precedent, regarding, archipelago, baselines, in, summer, 2000, two, canadian, ships, took, advantage, of, thinning, summer, ice, cover, on, the, arctic, ocean, to, make, the, crossing, it, is, thought, that, climate, change, is, likely, to, open, the, passage, for, increasing, periods, making, it, potentially, attractive, as, a, major, shipping, route, however, the, passage, through, the, arctic, ocean, would, require, significant, investment, in, escort, vessels, and, staging, ports, and, it, would, remain, seasonal, therefore, the, canadian, commercial, marine, transport, industry, does, not, anticipate, the, route, as, a, viable, alternative, to, the, panama, canal, within, the, next, 10, to, 20, years, as, of, 2004, on, september, 14, 2007, the, european, space, agency, esa, stated, that, ice, loss, that, year, had, opened, up, the, historically, impassable, passage, setting, a, new, low, of, ice, cover, as, seen, in, satellite, measurements, which, went, back, to, 1978, according, to, the, arctic, climate, impact, assessment, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, start, of, the, 21st, had, seen, marked, shrinkage, of, ice, cover, the, extreme, loss, in, 2007, rendered, the, passage, fully, navigable, however, the, esa, study, was, based, only, on, analysis, of, satellite, images, and, could, in, practice, not, confirm, anything, about, the, actual, navigation, of, the, waters, of, the, passage, esa, suggested, the, passage, would, be, navigable, during, reduced, ice, cover, by, multi, year, ice, pack, namely, sea, ice, surviving, one, or, more, summers, where, previously, any, traverse, of, the, route, had, to, be, undertaken, during, favourable, seasonable, climatic, conditions, or, by, specialist, vessels, or, expeditions, the, agency, s, report, speculated, that, the, conditions, prevalent, in, 2007, had, shown, the, passage, may, open, sooner, than, expected, an, expedition, in, may, 2008, reported, that, the, passage, was, not, yet, continuously, navigable, even, by, an, icebreaker, and, not, yet, ice, free, scientists, at, a, meeting, of, the, american, geophysical, union, on, december, 13, 2007, revealed, that, nasa, satellites, observing, the, western, arctic, showed, a, 16, decrease, in, cloud, coverage, during, the, summer, of, 2007, compared, to, 2006, this, would, have, the, effect, of, allowing, more, sunlight, to, penetrate, earth, s, atmosphere, and, warm, the, arctic, ocean, waters, thus, melting, sea, ice, and, contributing, to, opening, the, northwest, passage, in, 2006, the, cruise, liner, ms, bremen, successfully, ran, the, northwest, passage, helped, by, satellite, images, telling, where, sea, ice, was, on, november, 28, 2008, the, canadian, coast, guard, confirmed, the, first, commercial, ship, sailed, through, the, northwest, passage, in, september, 2008, mv, camilla, desgagn, s, owned, by, desgagn, s, transarctik, inc, and, along, with, the, arctic, cooperative, part, of, nunavut, sealift, and, supply, incorporated, nssi, transported, cargo, from, montreal, to, the, hamlets, of, cambridge, bay, kugluktuk, gjoa, haven, and, taloyoak, a, member, of, the, crew, is, reported, to, have, claimed, that, there, was, no, ice, whatsoever, shipping, from, the, east, was, to, resume, in, the, fall, of, 2009, although, sealift, is, an, annual, feature, of, the, canadian, arctic, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, western, communities, had, been, serviced, from, the, east, the, western, portion, of, the, canadian, arctic, is, normally, supplied, by, northern, transportation, company, limited, ntcl, from, hay, river, and, the, eastern, portion, by, nnsi, and, ntcl, from, churchill, and, montreal, in, january, 2010, the, ongoing, reduction, in, the, arctic, sea, ice, led, telecoms, cable, specialist, kodiak, kenai, cable, to, propose, the, laying, of, a, fibre, optic, cable, connecting, london, and, tokyo, by, way, of, the, northwest, passage, saying, the, proposed, system, would, nearly, cut, in, half, the, time, it, takes, to, send, messages, from, the, united, kingdom, to, japan, in, september, 2013, the, first, large, ice, strengthened, sea, freighter, nordic, orion, used, the, passage, in, 2016, a, new, record, was, set, when, the, cruise, ship, crystal, serenity, transited, with, 1, 700, passengers, and, crew, crystal, serenity, is, the, largest, cruise, ship, to, navigate, the, northwest, passage, starting, on, august, 10, 2016, the, ship, sailed, from, vancouver, to, new, york, city, taking, 28, days, for, the, journey, plans, to, lay, a, fibre, optic, cable, through, the, passage, were, revived, in, 2021, the, project, is, known, as, far, north, fiber, scientists, believe, that, reduced, sea, ice, in, the, northwest, passage, has, permitted, some, new, species, to, migrate, across, the, arctic, ocean, the, gray, whale, eschrichtius, robustus, has, not, been, seen, in, the, atlantic, since, it, was, hunted, to, extinction, there, in, the, 18th, century, but, in, may, 2010, one, such, whale, turned, up, in, the, mediterranean, scientists, speculated, the, whale, had, followed, its, food, sources, through, the, northwest, passage, and, simply, kept, on, going, the, plankton, species, neodenticula, seminae, had, not, been, recorded, in, the, atlantic, for, 800, 000, years, however, it, has, become, increasingly, prevalent, there, again, scientists, believe, that, it, got, there, through, the, reopened, northwest, passage, in, august, 2010, two, bowhead, whales, from, west, greenland, and, alaska, respectively, entered, the, northwest, passage, from, opposite, directions, and, spent, approximately, 10, days, in, the, same, area, download, coordinates, as
