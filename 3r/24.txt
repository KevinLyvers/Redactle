a, geodetic, datum, or, geodetic, system, also, geodetic, reference, datum, geodetic, reference, system, or, geodetic, reference, frame, or, terrestrial, reference, frame, is, a, global, datum, reference, or, reference, frame, for, unambiguously, representing, the, position, of, locations, on, earth, by, means, of, either, geodetic, coordinates, and, related, vertical, coordinates, or, geocentric, coordinates, datums, are, crucial, to, any, technology, or, technique, based, on, spatial, location, including, geodesy, navigation, surveying, geographic, information, systems, remote, sensing, and, cartography, a, horizontal, datum, is, used, to, measure, a, horizontal, position, across, the, earth, s, surface, in, latitude, and, longitude, or, another, related, coordinate, system, a, vertical, datum, is, used, to, measure, the, elevation, or, depth, relative, to, a, standard, origin, such, as, mean, sea, level, msl, a, three, dimensional, datum, enables, the, expression, of, both, horizontal, and, vertical, position, components, in, a, unified, form, the, concept, can, be, generalized, for, other, celestial, bodies, as, in, planetary, datums, since, the, rise, of, the, global, positioning, system, gps, the, ellipsoid, and, datum, wgs, 84, it, uses, has, supplanted, most, others, in, many, applications, the, wgs, 84, is, intended, for, global, use, unlike, most, earlier, datums, before, gps, there, was, no, precise, way, to, measure, the, position, of, a, location, that, was, far, from, reference, points, used, in, the, realization, of, local, datums, such, as, from, the, prime, meridian, at, the, greenwich, observatory, for, longitude, from, the, equator, for, latitude, or, from, the, nearest, coast, for, sea, level, astronomical, and, chronological, methods, have, limited, precision, and, accuracy, especially, over, long, distances, even, gps, requires, a, predefined, framework, on, which, to, base, its, measurements, so, wgs, 84, essentially, functions, as, a, datum, even, though, it, is, different, in, some, particulars, from, a, traditional, standard, horizontal, or, vertical, datum, a, standard, datum, specification, whether, horizontal, vertical, or, 3d, consists, of, several, parts, a, model, for, earth, s, shape, and, dimensions, such, as, a, reference, ellipsoid, or, a, geoid, an, origin, at, which, the, ellipsoid, geoid, is, tied, to, a, known, often, monumented, location, on, or, inside, earth, not, necessarily, at, 0, latitude, 0, longitude, and, multiple, control, points, or, reference, points, that, have, been, precisely, measured, from, the, origin, and, physically, monumented, then, the, coordinates, of, other, places, are, measured, from, the, nearest, control, point, through, surveying, because, the, ellipsoid, or, geoid, differs, between, datums, along, with, their, origins, and, orientation, in, space, the, relationship, between, coordinates, referred, to, one, datum, and, coordinates, referred, to, another, datum, is, undefined, and, can, only, be, approximated, using, local, datums, the, disparity, on, the, ground, between, a, point, having, the, same, horizontal, coordinates, in, two, different, datums, could, reach, kilometers, if, the, point, is, far, from, the, origin, of, one, or, both, datums, this, phenomenon, is, called, datum, shift, or, more, generally, datum, transformation, as, it, may, involve, rotation, and, scaling, in, addition, to, displacement, because, earth, is, an, imperfect, ellipsoid, local, datums, can, give, a, more, accurate, representation, of, some, specific, area, of, coverage, than, wgs, 84, can, osgb36, for, example, is, a, better, approximation, to, the, geoid, covering, the, british, isles, than, the, global, wgs, 84, ellipsoid, however, as, the, benefits, of, a, global, system, outweigh, the, greater, accuracy, the, global, wgs, 84, datum, has, become, widely, adopted, the, spherical, nature, of, earth, was, known, by, the, ancient, greeks, who, also, developed, the, concepts, of, latitude, and, longitude, and, the, first, astronomical, methods, for, measuring, them, these, methods, preserved, and, further, developed, by, muslim, and, indian, astronomers, were, sufficient, for, the, global, explorations, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, however, the, scientific, advances, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, brought, a, recognition, of, errors, in, these, measurements, and, a, demand, for, greater, precision, this, led, to, technological, innovations, such, as, the, 1735, marine, chronometer, by, john, harrison, but, also, to, a, reconsideration, of, the, underlying, assumptions, about, the, shape, of, earth, itself, isaac, newton, postulated, that, the, conservation, of, momentum, should, make, earth, oblate, wider, at, the, equator, while, the, early, surveys, of, jacques, cassini, 1720, led, him, to, believe, earth, was, prolate, wider, at, the, poles, the, subsequent, french, geodesic, missions, 1735, 1739, to, lapland, and, peru, corroborated, newton, but, also, discovered, variations, in, gravity, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, geoid, model, a, contemporary, development, was, the, use, of, the, trigonometric, survey, to, accurately, measure, distance, and, location, over, great, distances, starting, with, the, surveys, of, jacques, cassini, 1718, and, the, anglo, french, survey, 1784, 1790, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, survey, control, networks, covered, france, and, the, united, kingdom, more, ambitious, undertakings, such, as, the, struve, geodetic, arc, across, eastern, europe, 1816, 1855, and, the, great, trigonometrical, survey, of, india, 1802, 1871, took, much, longer, but, resulted, in, more, accurate, estimations, of, the, shape, of, the, earth, ellipsoid, the, first, triangulation, across, the, united, states, was, not, completed, until, 1899, the, u, s, survey, resulted, in, the, north, american, datum, horizontal, of, 1927, nad27, and, the, vertical, datum, of, 1929, navd29, the, first, standard, datums, available, for, public, use, this, was, followed, by, the, release, of, national, and, regional, datums, over, the, next, several, decades, improving, measurements, including, the, use, of, early, satellites, enabled, more, accurate, datums, in, the, later, 20th, century, such, as, nad83, in, north, america, etrs89, in, europe, and, gda94, in, australia, at, this, time, global, datums, were, also, first, developed, for, use, in, satellite, navigation, systems, especially, the, world, geodetic, system, wgs, 84, used, in, the, u, s, global, positioning, system, gps, and, the, international, terrestrial, reference, system, and, frame, itrf, used, in, the, european, galileo, system, a, horizontal, datum, is, a, model, used, to, precisely, measure, positions, on, earth, it, is, thus, a, crucial, component, of, any, spatial, reference, system, or, map, projection, a, horizontal, datum, binds, a, specified, reference, ellipsoid, a, mathematical, model, of, the, shape, of, the, earth, to, the, physical, earth, thus, the, geographic, coordinate, system, on, that, ellipsoid, can, be, used, to, measure, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, real, world, locations, regional, horizontal, datums, such, as, nad27, and, nad83, usually, create, this, binding, with, a, series, of, physically, monumented, geodetic, control, points, of, known, location, global, datums, such, as, wgs84, and, itrf, are, typically, bound, to, the, center, of, mass, of, the, earth, making, them, useful, for, tracking, satellite, orbits, and, thus, for, use, in, satellite, navigation, systems, a, specific, point, can, have, substantially, different, coordinates, depending, on, the, datum, used, to, make, the, measurement, for, example, coordinates, in, nad83, can, differ, from, nad27, by, up, to, several, hundred, feet, there, are, hundreds, of, local, horizontal, datums, around, the, world, usually, referenced, to, some, convenient, local, reference, point, contemporary, datums, based, on, increasingly, accurate, measurements, of, the, shape, of, earth, are, intended, to, cover, larger, areas, the, wgs, 84, datum, which, is, almost, identical, to, the, nad83, datum, used, in, north, america, and, the, etrs89, datum, used, in, europe, is, a, common, standard, datum, a, vertical, datum, is, a, reference, surface, for, vertical, positions, such, as, the, elevations, of, earth, features, including, terrain, bathymetry, water, level, and, human, made, structures, an, approximate, definition, of, sea, level, is, the, datum, wgs, 84, an, ellipsoid, whereas, a, more, accurate, definition, is, earth, gravitational, model, 2008, egm2008, using, at, least, 2, 159, spherical, harmonics, other, datums, are, defined, for, other, areas, or, at, other, times, ed50, was, defined, in, 1950, over, europe, and, differs, from, wgs, 84, by, a, few, hundred, meters, depending, on, where, in, europe, you, look, mars, has, no, oceans, and, so, no, sea, level, but, at, least, two, martian, datums, have, been, used, to, locate, places, there, in, geodetic, coordinates, earth, s, surface, is, approximated, by, an, ellipsoid, and, locations, near, the, surface, are, described, in, terms, of, geodetic, latitude, displaystyle, phi, longitude, displaystyle, lambda, and, ellipsoidal, height, h, displaystyle, h, the, ellipsoid, is, completely, parameterised, by, the, semi, major, axis, a, displaystyle, a, and, the, flattening, f, displaystyle, f, from, a, displaystyle, a, and, f, displaystyle, f, it, is, possible, to, derive, the, semi, minor, axis, b, displaystyle, b, first, eccentricity, e, displaystyle, e, and, second, eccentricity, e, displaystyle, e, of, the, ellipsoid, the, two, main, reference, ellipsoids, used, worldwide, are, the, grs80, and, the, wgs, 84, a, more, comprehensive, list, of, geodetic, systems, can, be, found, here, the, global, positioning, system, gps, uses, the, world, geodetic, system, 1984, wgs, 84, to, determine, the, location, of, a, point, near, the, surface, of, earth, the, difference, in, co, ordinates, between, datums, is, commonly, referred, to, as, datum, shift, the, datum, shift, between, two, particular, datums, can, vary, from, one, place, to, another, within, one, country, or, region, and, can, be, anything, from, zero, to, hundreds, of, meters, or, several, kilometers, for, some, remote, islands, the, north, pole, south, pole, and, equator, will, be, in, different, positions, on, different, datums, so, true, north, will, be, slightly, different, different, datums, use, different, interpolations, for, the, precise, shape, and, size, of, earth, reference, ellipsoids, for, example, in, sydney, there, is, a, 200, metres, 700, feet, difference, between, gps, coordinates, configured, in, gda, based, on, global, standard, wgs, 84, and, agd, used, for, most, local, maps, which, is, an, unacceptably, large, error, for, some, applications, such, as, surveying, or, site, location, for, scuba, diving, datum, conversion, is, the, process, of, converting, the, coordinates, of, a, point, from, one, datum, system, to, another, because, the, survey, networks, upon, which, datums, were, traditionally, based, are, irregular, and, the, error, in, early, surveys, is, not, evenly, distributed, datum, conversion, cannot, be, performed, using, a, simple, parametric, function, for, example, converting, from, nad27, to, nad83, is, performed, using, nadcon, later, improved, as, harn, a, raster, grid, covering, north, america, with, the, value, of, each, cell, being, the, average, adjustment, distance, for, that, area, in, latitude, and, longitude, datum, conversion, may, frequently, be, accompanied, by, a, change, of, map, projection, a, geodetic, reference, datum, is, a, known, and, constant, surface, which, is, used, to, describe, the, location, of, unknown, points, on, earth, since, reference, datums, can, have, different, radii, and, different, center, points, a, specific, point, on, earth, can, have, substantially, different, coordinates, depending, on, the, datum, used, to, make, the, measurement, there, are, hundreds, of, locally, developed, reference, datums, around, the, world, usually, referenced, to, some, convenient, local, reference, point, contemporary, datums, based, on, increasingly, accurate, measurements, of, the, shape, of, earth, are, intended, to, cover, larger, areas, the, most, common, reference, datums, in, use, in, north, america, are, nad27, nad83, and, wgs, 84, the, north, american, datum, of, 1927, nad, 27, is, the, horizontal, control, datum, for, the, united, states, that, was, defined, by, a, location, and, azimuth, on, the, clarke, spheroid, of, 1866, with, origin, at, the, survey, station, meades, ranch, kansas, the, geoidal, height, at, meades, ranch, was, assumed, to, be, zero, as, sufficient, gravity, data, was, not, available, and, this, was, needed, to, relate, surface, measurements, to, the, datum, geodetic, positions, on, the, north, american, datum, of, 1927, were, derived, from, the, coordinates, of, and, an, azimuth, at, meades, ranch, through, a, readjustment, of, the, triangulation, of, the, entire, network, in, which, laplace, azimuths, were, introduced, and, the, bowie, method, was, used, http, www, ngs, noaa, gov, faq, shtml, whatdatum, nad27, is, a, local, referencing, system, covering, north, america, the, north, american, datum, of, 1983, nad, 83, is, the, horizontal, control, datum, for, the, united, states, canada, mexico, and, central, america, based, on, a, geocentric, origin, and, the, geodetic, reference, system, 1980, grs80, this, datum, designated, as, nad, 83, is, based, on, the, adjustment, of, 250, 000, points, including, 600, satellite, doppler, stations, which, constrain, the, system, to, a, geocentric, origin, nad83, may, be, considered, a, local, referencing, system, wgs, 84, is, the, world, geodetic, system, of, 1984, it, is, the, reference, frame, used, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, dod, and, is, defined, by, the, national, geospatial, intelligence, agency, nga, formerly, the, defense, mapping, agency, then, the, national, imagery, and, mapping, agency, wgs, 84, is, used, by, the, dod, for, all, its, mapping, charting, surveying, and, navigation, needs, including, its, gps, broadcast, and, precise, orbits, wgs, 84, was, defined, in, january, 1987, using, doppler, satellite, surveying, techniques, it, was, used, as, the, reference, frame, for, broadcast, gps, ephemerides, orbits, beginning, january, 23, 1987, at, 0000, gmt, january, 2, 1994, wgs, 84, was, upgraded, in, accuracy, using, gps, measurements, the, formal, name, then, became, wgs, 84, g730, since, the, upgrade, date, coincided, with, the, start, of, gps, week, 730, it, became, the, reference, frame, for, broadcast, orbits, on, june, 28, 1994, at, 0000, gmt, september, 30, 1996, the, start, of, gps, week, 873, wgs, 84, was, redefined, again, and, was, more, closely, aligned, with, international, earth, rotation, service, iers, frame, itrf, 94, it, was, then, formally, called, wgs, 84, g873, wgs, 84, g873, was, adopted, as, the, reference, frame, for, broadcast, orbits, on, january, 29, 1997, another, update, brought, it, to, wgs, 84, g1674, the, wgs, 84, datum, within, two, meters, of, the, nad83, datum, used, in, north, america, is, the, only, world, referencing, system, in, place, today, wgs, 84, is, the, default, standard, datum, for, coordinates, stored, in, recreational, and, commercial, gps, units, users, of, gps, are, cautioned, that, they, must, always, check, the, datum, of, the, maps, they, are, using, to, correctly, enter, display, and, to, store, map, related, map, coordinates, the, datum, of, the, map, must, be, entered, into, the, gps, map, datum, field, examples, of, map, datums, are, the, earth, s, tectonic, plates, move, relative, to, one, another, in, different, directions, at, speeds, on, the, order, of, 50, to, 100, mm, 2, 0, to, 3, 9, in, per, year, therefore, locations, on, different, plates, are, in, motion, relative, to, one, another, for, example, the, longitudinal, difference, between, a, point, on, the, equator, in, uganda, on, the, african, plate, and, a, point, on, the, equator, in, ecuador, on, the, south, american, plate, increases, by, about, 0, 0014, arcseconds, per, year, these, tectonic, movements, likewise, affect, latitude, if, a, global, reference, frame, such, as, wgs84, is, used, the, coordinates, of, a, place, on, the, surface, generally, will, change, from, year, to, year, most, mapping, such, as, within, a, single, country, does, not, span, plates, to, minimize, coordinate, changes, for, that, case, a, different, reference, frame, can, be, used, one, whose, coordinates, are, fixed, to, that, particular, plate, examples, of, these, reference, frames, are, nad83, for, north, america, and, etrs89, for, europe
