average, the, highest, amount, paid, in, any, british, territory, this, was, a, form, of, reparation, that, was, not, given, to, the, enslaved, africans, at, the, time, nor, since, the, end, of, slavery, did, little, to, change, the, formerly, enslaved, africans, working, conditions, if, they, stayed, at, their, trade, a, series, of, institutions, restricted, the, ability, of, emancipated,

and, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, caused, a, near, collapse, of, the, colony, s, economy, as, british, demand, for, timber, plummeted, the, effects, of, widespread, unemployment, were, worsened, by, a, devastating, hurricane, that, struck, the, colony, in, 1931, perceptions, of, the, government, s, relief, effort, as, inadequate, were, aggravated, by, its, refusal, to, legalize, labour, unions, or, introduce, a, minimum, wage, economic, conditions, improved, during, world, war, ii, as, many, belizean, men, entered, the, armed,

that, only, 10, of, all, species, have, been, discovered, belize, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, completely, ban, bottom, trawling, in, december, 2010, in, december, 2015, belize, banned, offshore, oil, drilling, within, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, of, the, barrier, reef, and, all, of, its, seven, world, heritage, sites, despite, these, protective, measures, the, reef, remains, under, threat, from, oceanic, pollution, as, well, as, uncontrolled, tourism, shipping, and, fishing, other, threats, include, hurricanes, along, with, global, warming, and, the, resulting, increase, in,

mopan, indigenous, to, belize, but, were, forced, out, to, guatemala, by, the, british, for, raiding, settlements, they, returned, to, belize, to, evade, enslavement, by, the, guatemalans, in, the, 19th, century, and, q, eqchi, also, fled, from, slavery, in, guatemala, in, the, 19th, century, the, latter, groups, are, chiefly, found, in, the, toledo, district, the, maya, speak, their, native,

intermarried, with, miskito, from, nicaragua, jamaicans, and, other, caribbean, people, mestizos, europeans, garifunas, maya, etc, the, majority, of, creoles, trace, their, ancestry, to, several, of, the, aforementioned, groups, the, creole, and, african, slaves, came, to, british, honduras, modern, day, belize, from, jamaica, as, jamaica, was, the, closest, british, colony, administering, british, honduras, at, the, time, and, it, was, the, slave, ships, final, destination, it, is, also, mentioned, that, many, slaves, brought, to, belize, were, trouble, makers, and, resisters, from, jamaican, sugar, cane, plantations, belize, town, was, the, epicentre, of, the, colony, and, many, slaves, ended, up, in, the, logwood, and, timber, industry, women, and, children, stayed, doing, domestic, and, farm, work, slaves, in, belize, were, more, free, to, travel, and, roam, around, the, colony, due, to, their, work, this, caused, the, rapid, integration, of, african, slaves, from, different, tribes, and, parts, of, africa, to, mingle, with, the, free, coloureds, and, sons, and, daughters, of, slave, owners, with, slaves, some, predominant, coloured, or, light, skinned, creole,

complexion, and, more, visible, european, traits, the, belizean, creole, along, with, africans, and, garifuna, make, up, the, afro, belizean, population, about, 30, of, the, population, the, creoles, have, had, a, great, impact, in, belizean, history, and, politics, they, were, active, and, part, of, the, battle, of, st, george, s, caye, part, of, the, british, west, indies, battalion, in, world,

the, uk, in, which, after, returning, to, belize, the, educated, scholars, rallied, and, started, the, movement, for, adult, suffrage, self, government, and, independence, all, of, the, important, historical, events, started, in, belize, city, and, most, of, the, first, people, involved, were, of, creole, descent, which, were, the, upper, and, middle, class, of, belize, at, the, time, well, known, creole, belizeans, were, samuel, haynes, philip, goldson, dean, barrow, dame, minita, gordon, cleopatra, white, cordel, hyde, and, patrick, faber, among, others, the, creole, were, the, biggest, ethnic, group, in, belize, until, the, 1980s, due, to, mass, migration, of, afro, belizeans, to, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, west, indies, from, the, 1960s, to, 1970s, and, the, mass, immigration, of, central, american, refugees, to, belize, due, to, the, central, american, war, and, political, instability, the, country, s, demographics, changed, forever, for, all,
