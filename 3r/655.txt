patagonia, spanish, pronunciation, is, a, geographical, region, that, encompasses, the, southern, end, of, south, america, governed, by, argentina, and, chile, the, region, comprises, the, southern, section, of, the, andes, mountains, with, lakes, fjords, temperate, rainforests, and, glaciers, in, the, west, and, deserts, tablelands, and, steppes, to, the, east, patagonia, is, bounded, by, the, pacific, ocean, on, the, west, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, east, and, many, bodies, of, water, that, connect, them, such, as, the, strait, of, magellan, the, beagle, channel, and, the, drake, passage, to, the, south, the, colorado, and, barrancas, rivers, which, run, from, the, andes, to, the, atlantic, are, commonly, considered, the, northern, limit, of, argentine, patagonia, the, archipelago, of, tierra, del, fuego, is, sometimes, included, as, part, of, patagonia, most, geographers, and, historians, locate, the, northern, limit, of, chilean, patagonia, at, huincul, fault, in, araucan, a, region, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, arrival, patagonia, was, inhabited, by, multiple, indigenous, tribes, in, a, small, portion, of, northwestern, patagonia, indigenous, peoples, practiced, agriculture, while, in, the, remaining, territory, peoples, lived, as, hunter, gatherers, traveling, by, foot, in, eastern, patagonia, or, by, dugout, canoe, and, dalca, in, the, fjords, and, channels, in, colonial, times, indigenous, peoples, of, northeastern, patagonia, adopted, a, horseriding, lifestyle, while, the, interest, of, the, spanish, empire, had, been, chiefly, to, keep, other, european, powers, away, from, patagonia, independent, chile, and, argentina, began, to, colonize, the, territory, slowly, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, this, process, brought, a, decline, of, the, indigenous, populations, whose, lives, and, habitats, were, disrupted, while, at, the, same, time, thousands, of, europeans, argentines, chilotes, and, mainland, chileans, settled, in, patagonia, the, contemporary, economy, of, eastern, patagonia, revolves, around, sheep, farming, and, oil, and, gas, extraction, while, in, western, patagonia, fishing, salmon, aquaculture, and, tourism, dominate, the, name, patagonia, comes, from, the, word, patag, n, magellan, used, this, term, in, 1520, to, describe, the, native, tribes, of, the, region, whom, his, expedition, thought, to, be, giants, the, people, he, called, the, patagons, are, now, believed, to, have, been, the, tehuelche, who, tended, to, be, taller, than, europeans, of, the, time, argentine, researcher, miguel, doura, observed, that, the, name, patagonia, possibly, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, region, of, modern, turkey, called, paphlagonia, possible, home, of, the, patagon, personage, in, the, chivalric, romances, primaleon, printed, in, 1512, ten, years, before, magellan, arrived, in, these, southern, lands, this, hypothesis, was, published, in, a, 2011, new, review, of, spanish, philology, report, there, are, various, placenames, in, the, chilo, archipelago, with, chono, etymologies, despite, the, main, indigenous, language, of, the, archipelago, at, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, being, mapudungun, a, theory, postulated, by, chronicler, jos, p, rez, garc, a, explains, this, holding, that, the, cuncos, also, known, as, veliches, settled, in, chilo, island, in, pre, hispanic, times, as, a, consequence, of, a, push, from, more, northern, huilliches, who, in, turn, were, being, displaced, by, mapuches, while, being, outside, traditional, huilliche, territory, the, western, patagonian, volcanoes, michimahuida, hornopir, n, and, chait, n, have, huilliche, etymologies, in, chubut, province, modern, toponymy, comes, from, the, word, chupat, belonging, to, a, transitional, language, between, the, southern, and, northern, tehuelche, ethnic, groups, that, were, located, in, that, region, called, tews, n, or, teushen, the, word, means, transparency, and, is, related, to, the, clarity, and, purity, of, the, river, that, bears, that, name, and, runs, through, the, province, it, is, also, related, to, the, origin, of, the, welsh, pronunciation, of, the, word, chupat, which, later, became, chubut, it, is, called, camwy, in, patagonian, welsh, chupat, chubut, and, camwy, have, the, same, meaning, and, are, used, to, talk, about, the, river, and, the, province, welsh, settlers, and, placenames, are, associated, with, one, of, the, projects, of, the, country, of, wales, project, hiraeth, due, to, the, language, culture, and, location, many, patagonians, do, not, consider, themselves, latinos, and, proudly, call, themselves, patagonians, instead, people, from, y, wladfa, laurie, island, the, atlantic, islands, antarctica, including, the, chilean, town, in, antarctica, the, stars, village, and, the, argentine, civilian, settlement, hope, base, other, non, latin, speaking, areas, use, this, term, as, a, patriotic, and, inclusive, demonym, a, patagonian, is, a, person, that, is, part, of, the, patagonia, region, language, and, culture, that, person, could, be, a, citizen, from, chilean, patagonia, argentine, patagonia, or, of, native, communities, that, existed, before, the, land, was, divided, by, the, boundary, treaty, of, 1881, patagonia, is, divided, between, western, patagonia, chile, and, eastern, patagonia, argentina, and, several, territories, are, still, under, dispute, and, claiming, their, rights, mapuche, people, came, from, the, chilean, andes, and, voted, to, remain, in, different, sides, of, patagonia, welsh, settlers, came, from, wales, and, north, america, and, voted, to, remain, in, patagonia, when, the, treaty, was, signed, they, voted, for, culture, and, administration, to, be, apart, from, the, country, keeping, the, settlement, language, schools, traditions, regional, dates, flag, anthems, and, celebrations, patagonians, also, live, abroad, in, settlements, like, saltcoats, saskatchewan, canada, new, south, wales, australia, south, africa, the, falkland, islands, and, north, america, argentine, patagonia, is, for, the, most, part, a, region, of, steppe, like, plains, rising, in, a, succession, of, 13, abrupt, terraces, about, 100, m, 330, ft, at, a, time, and, covered, with, an, enormous, bed, of, shingle, almost, bare, of, vegetation, in, the, hollows, of, the, plains, are, ponds, or, lakes, of, fresh, and, brackish, water, towards, chilean, territory, the, shingle, gives, way, to, porphyry, granite, and, basalt, lavas, and, animal, life, becomes, more, abundant, vegetation, is, more, luxuriant, consisting, principally, of, southern, beech, and, conifers, the, high, rainfall, against, the, western, andes, wet, andes, and, the, low, sea, surface, temperatures, offshore, give, rise, to, cold, and, humid, air, masses, contributing, to, the, ice, fields, and, glaciers, the, largest, ice, fields, in, the, southern, hemisphere, outside, of, antarctica, among, the, depressions, by, which, the, plateau, is, intersected, transversely, the, principal, ones, are, the, gualichu, south, of, the, r, o, negro, the, maquinchao, and, valcheta, through, which, previously, flowed, the, waters, of, nahuel, huapi, lake, which, now, feed, the, limay, river, the, senguerr, spelled, senguer, on, most, argentine, maps, and, within, the, corresponding, region, and, the, deseado, river, besides, these, transverse, depressions, some, of, them, marking, lines, of, ancient, interoceanic, communication, others, were, occupied, by, either, more, or, less, extensive, lakes, such, as, the, yagagtoo, musters, and, colhue, huapi, and, others, situated, to, the, south, of, puerto, deseado, in, the, center, of, the, country, across, much, of, patagonia, east, of, the, andes, volcanic, eruptions, have, created, formation, of, basaltic, lava, plateaus, during, the, cenozoic, the, plateaus, are, of, different, ages, with, the, older, of, neogene, and, paleogene, age, being, located, at, higher, elevations, than, pleistocene, and, holocene, lava, plateaus, and, outcrops, erosion, which, is, caused, principally, by, the, sudden, melting, and, retreat, of, ice, aided, by, tectonic, changes, has, scooped, out, a, deep, longitudinal, depression, best, in, evidence, where, in, contact, with, folded, cretaceous, rocks, which, are, lifted, up, by, the, cenozoic, granite, it, generally, separates, the, plateau, from, the, first, lofty, hills, whose, ridges, are, generally, called, the, pre, cordillera, to, the, west, of, these, a, similar, longitudinal, depression, extends, all, along, the, foot, of, the, snowy, andean, cordillera, this, latter, depression, contains, the, richest, most, fertile, land, of, patagonia, lake, basins, along, the, cordillera, were, also, gradually, excavated, by, ice, streams, including, lake, argentino, and, lake, fagnano, as, well, as, coastal, bays, such, as, bah, a, in, til, the, establishment, of, dams, near, the, andes, in, argentina, in, the, 20th, century, has, led, to, a, sediment, shortage, along, the, atlantic, coast, of, patagonia, the, geological, limit, of, patagonia, has, been, proposed, to, be, huincul, fault, which, forms, a, major, discontinuity, the, fault, truncates, various, structures, including, the, pampean, orogen, found, further, north, the, ages, of, base, rocks, change, abruptly, across, the, fault, discrepancies, have, been, mentioned, among, geologists, on, the, origin, of, the, patagonian, landmass, v, ctor, ramos, has, proposed, that, the, patagonian, landmass, originated, as, an, allochthonous, terrane, that, separated, from, antarctica, and, docked, in, south, america, 250, to, 270, mya, in, the, permian, period, a, 2014, study, by, r, j, pankhurst, and, coworkers, rejects, any, idea, of, a, far, traveled, patagonia, claiming, it, is, likely, of, parautochtonous, nearby, origin, the, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, deposits, have, revealed, a, most, interesting, vertebrate, fauna, this, together, with, the, discovery, of, the, perfect, cranium, of, a, turtle, chelonian, of, the, genus, niolamia, which, is, almost, identical, to, ninjemys, oweni, of, the, pleistocene, age, in, queensland, forms, an, evident, proof, of, the, connection, between, the, australian, and, south, american, continents, the, patagonian, niolamia, belongs, to, the, sarmienti, formation, fossils, of, the, mid, cretaceous, argentinosaurus, which, may, be, the, largest, of, all, dinosaurs, have, been, found, in, patagonia, and, a, model, of, the, mid, jurassic, piatnitzkysaurus, graces, the, concourse, of, the, trelew, airport, the, skeleton, is, in, the, trelew, paleontological, museum, the, museum, s, staff, has, also, announced, the, discovery, of, a, species, of, dinosaur, even, bigger, than, argentinosaurus, of, more, than, paleontological, interest, the, middle, jurassic, los, molles, formation, and, the, still, richer, late, jurassic, tithonian, and, early, cretaceous, berriasian, vaca, muerta, formation, above, it, in, the, neuqu, n, basin, are, reported, to, contain, huge, hydrocarbon, reserves, mostly, gas, in, los, molles, both, gas, and, oil, in, vaca, muerta, partly, accessible, through, hydraulic, fracturing, other, specimens, of, the, interesting, fauna, of, patagonia, belonging, to, the, middle, cenozoic, are, the, gigantic, wingless, birds, exceeding, in, size, any, hitherto, known, and, the, singular, mammal, pyrotherium, also, of, very, large, dimensions, in, the, cenozoic, marine, formation, considerable, numbers, of, cetaceans, have, been, discovered, during, the, oligocene, and, early, miocene, large, swathes, of, patagonia, were, subject, to, a, marine, transgression, which, might, have, temporarily, linked, the, pacific, and, atlantic, oceans, as, inferred, from, the, findings, of, marine, invertebrate, fossils, of, both, atlantic, and, pacific, affinity, in, la, cascada, formation, connection, would, have, occurred, through, narrow, epicontinental, seaways, that, formed, channels, in, a, dissected, topography, the, antarctic, plate, started, to, subduct, beneath, south, america, 14, million, years, ago, in, the, miocene, forming, the, chile, triple, junction, at, first, the, antarctic, plate, subducted, only, in, the, southernmost, tip, of, patagonia, meaning, that, the, chile, triple, junction, was, located, near, the, strait, of, magellan, as, the, southern, part, of, the, nazca, plate, and, the, chile, rise, became, consumed, by, subduction, the, more, northerly, regions, of, the, antarctic, plate, began, to, subduct, beneath, patagonia, so, that, the, chile, triple, junction, advanced, to, the, north, over, time, the, asthenospheric, window, associated, to, the, triple, junction, disturbed, previous, patterns, of, mantle, convection, beneath, patagonia, inducing, an, uplift, of, c, 1, km, that, reversed, the, miocene, transgression, at, a, state, level, patagonia, visually, occupies, an, area, within, two, countries, approximately, 10, in, chile, and, approximately, 90, in, argentina, both, countries, have, organized, their, patagonian, territories, into, nonequivalent, administrative, subdivisions, provinces, and, departments, in, argentina, as, well, as, regions, provinces, and, communes, in, chile, as, chile, is, a, unitary, state, its, first, level, administrative, divisions, the, regions, enjoy, far, less, autonomy, than, analogous, argentine, provinces, argentine, provinces, have, elected, governors, and, legislatures, while, chilean, regions, had, government, appointed, intendants, prior, to, the, adoption, of, elected, governors, from, 2021, the, patagonian, provinces, of, argentina, are, neuqu, n, r, o, negro, chubut, santa, cruz, and, tierra, del, fuego, the, southernmost, part, of, buenos, aires, province, can, also, be, considered, part, of, patagonia, the, two, chilean, regions, undisputedly, located, entirely, within, patagonia, are, ays, n, and, magallanes, palena, province, a, part, of, the, los, lagos, region, is, also, located, within, patagonia, by, some, definitions, chilo, archipelago, the, rest, of, the, los, lagos, region, and, part, of, the, los, r, os, region, are, also, part, of, patagonia, patagonia, s, climate, is, mostly, cool, and, dry, year, round, the, east, coast, is, warmer, than, the, west, especially, in, summer, as, a, branch, of, the, southern, equatorial, current, reaches, its, shores, whereas, the, west, coast, is, washed, by, a, cold, current, however, winters, are, colder, on, the, inland, plateaus, east, of, the, slopes, and, further, down, the, coast, on, the, southeast, end, of, the, patagonian, region, for, example, at, puerto, montt, on, the, inlet, behind, chilo, island, the, mean, annual, temperature, is, 11, c, 52, f, and, the, average, extremes, are, 25, 5, and, 1, 5, c, 77, 9, and, 29, 3, f, whereas, at, bah, a, blanca, near, the, atlantic, coast, and, just, outside, the, northern, confines, of, patagonia, the, annual, temperature, is, 15, c, 59, f, and, the, range, much, greater, as, temperatures, above, 35, c, and, below, 5, c, are, recorded, every, year, at, punta, arenas, in, the, extreme, south, the, mean, temperature, is, 6, c, 43, f, and, the, average, extremes, are, 24, 5, and, 2, c, 76, 1, and, 28, 4, f, the, prevailing, winds, are, westerly, and, the, westward, slope, has, a, much, heavier, precipitation, than, the, eastern, in, a, rainshadow, effect, the, western, islands, close, to, torres, del, paine, receive, an, annual, precipitation, of, 4, 000, to, 7, 000, mm, whilst, the, eastern, hills, are, less, than, 800, mm, and, the, plains, may, be, as, low, as, 200, mm, annual, precipitation, precipitation, is, highly, seasonal, in, northwestern, patagonia, for, example, villa, la, angostura, in, argentina, close, to, the, border, with, chile, receives, up, to, 434, mm, of, rain, and, snow, in, may, 297, mm, in, june, and, 273, in, july, compared, to, 80, in, february, and, 72, in, march, the, total, for, the, city, is, 2074, mm, making, it, one, of, the, rainiest, in, argentina, further, west, some, areas, receive, up, to, 4, 000, mm, and, more, especially, on, the, chilean, side, in, the, northeast, the, seasons, for, rain, are, reversed, most, rain, falls, from, occasional, summer, thunderstorms, but, totals, barely, reach, 500, mm, in, the, northeast, corner, and, rapidly, decrease, to, less, than, 300, mm, the, patagonian, west, coast, which, belongs, exclusively, to, chile, has, a, cool, oceanic, climate, with, summer, maximum, temperatures, ranging, from, 14, c, in, the, south, to, 19, c, in, the, north, and, nights, between, 5, and, 11, c, and, very, high, precipitation, from, 2, 000, to, more, than, 7, 000, mm, in, local, microclimates, snow, is, uncommon, at, the, coast, in, the, north, but, happens, more, often, in, the, south, and, frost, is, usually, not, very, intense, immediately, east, from, the, coast, are, the, andes, cut, by, deep, fjords, in, the, south, and, by, deep, lakes, in, the, north, and, with, varying, temperatures, according, to, the, altitude, the, tree, line, ranges, from, close, to, 2, 000, m, on, the, northern, side, except, for, the, andes, in, northern, neuqu, n, in, argentina, where, sunnier, and, dryer, conditions, allow, trees, to, grow, up, to, close, to, 3, 000, m, and, diminishes, southward, to, only, 600, 800, m, in, tierra, del, fuego, precipitation, changes, dramatically, from, one, spot, to, the, other, and, diminishes, very, quickly, eastward, an, example, of, this, is, laguna, fr, as, in, argentina, which, receives, 4, 400, mm, yearly, the, city, of, bariloche, about, 40, km, further, east, receives, about, 1, 000, mm, and, the, airport, another, 15, km, east, receives, less, than, 600, mm, the, easterly, slopes, of, the, andes, are, home, to, several, argentine, cities, san, mart, n, de, los, andes, bariloche, el, bols, n, esquel, and, el, calafate, temperatures, there, are, milder, in, the, summer, in, the, north, between, 20, and, 24, c, with, cold, nights, between, 4, and, 9, c, in, the, south, summers, are, between, 16, and, 20, c, at, night, temperatures, are, similar, to, the, north, and, much, colder, in, the, winter, with, frequent, snowfall, although, snow, cover, rarely, lasts, very, long, daytime, highs, range, from, 3, to, 9, c, in, the, north, and, from, 0, to, 7, c, in, the, south, whereas, nights, range, from, 5, to, 2, c, everywhere, cold, waves, can, bring, much, colder, values, a, temperature, of, 25, c, has, been, recorded, in, bariloche, and, most, places, can, often, have, temperatures, between, 12, and, 15, c, and, highs, staying, around, 0, c, for, a, few, days, directly, east, of, these, areas, the, weather, becomes, much, harsher, precipitation, drops, to, between, 150, and, 300, mm, the, mountains, no, longer, protect, the, cities, from, the, wind, and, temperatures, become, more, extreme, maquinchao, is, a, few, hundred, kilometers, east, of, bariloche, at, the, same, altitude, on, a, plateau, and, summer, daytime, temperatures, are, usually, about, 5, c, warmer, rising, up, to, 35, c, sometimes, but, winter, temperatures, are, much, more, extreme, the, record, is, 35, c, and, some, nights, not, uncommonly, reach, 10, c, colder, than, bariloche, the, plateaus, in, santa, cruz, province, and, parts, of, chubut, usually, have, snow, cover, through, the, winter, and, often, experience, very, cold, temperatures, in, chile, the, city, of, balmaceda, is, known, for, being, situated, in, this, region, which, is, otherwise, almost, exclusively, in, argentina, and, for, being, the, coldest, place, in, chile, in, 2017, temperatures, even, dropped, down, to, 20, c, in, the, region, the, northern, atlantic, coast, has, warm, summers, 28, to, 32, c, but, with, relatively, cool, nights, at, 15, c, and, mild, winters, with, highs, around, 12, c, and, lows, about, 2, 3, c, occasionally, temperatures, reach, 10, or, 40, c, and, rainfall, is, very, scarce, the, weather, only, gets, a, bit, colder, further, south, in, chubut, and, the, city, of, comodoro, rivadavia, has, summer, temperatures, of, 24, to, 28, c, nights, of, 12, to, 16, c, and, winters, with, days, around, 10, c, and, nights, around, 3, c, and, less, than, 250, mm, of, rain, however, a, drastic, drop, occurs, as, one, moves, south, to, santa, cruz, rio, gallegos, in, the, south, of, the, province, has, summer, temps, of, 17, to, 21, c, nights, between, 6, and, 10, c, and, winter, temperatures, of, 2, to, 6, c, with, nights, between, 5, and, 0, c, despite, being, right, on, the, coast, snowfall, is, common, despite, the, dryness, and, temperatures, are, known, to, fall, to, under, 18, c, and, to, remain, below, freezing, for, several, days, in, a, row, rio, gallegos, is, also, among, the, windiest, places, on, earth, with, winds, reaching, 100, km, h, occasionally, tierra, del, fuego, is, extremely, wet, in, the, west, relatively, damp, in, the, south, and, dry, in, the, north, and, east, summers, are, cool, 13, to, 18, c, in, the, north, 12, to, 16, c, in, the, south, with, nights, generally, between, 3, and, 8, c, cloudy, in, the, south, and, very, windy, winters, are, dark, and, cold, but, without, the, extreme, temperatures, in, the, south, and, west, ushuaia, rarely, reaches, 10, c, but, hovers, around, 0, c, for, several, months, and, snow, can, be, heavy, in, the, east, and, north, winters, are, much, more, severe, with, cold, snaps, bringing, temperatures, down, to, 20, c, all, the, way, to, the, rio, grande, on, the, atlantic, coast, snow, can, fall, even,

glacial, period, ice, fields, and, subsequent, large, meltwater, streams, would, have, made, settlement, difficult, at, that, time, the, region, seems, to, have, been, inhabited, continuously, since, 10, 000, bc, by, various, cultures, and, alternating, waves, of, migration, the, details, of, which, are, as, yet, poorly, understood, several, sites, have, been, excavated, notably, caves, such, as, cueva, del, milodon, in, ltima, esperanza, in, southern, patagonia, and, tres, arroyos, on, tierra, del, fuego, that, support, this, date, hearths, stone, scrapers, and, animal, remains, dated, to, 9400, 9200, bc, have, been, found, east, of, the, andes, the, cueva, de, las, manos, is, a, famous, site, in, santa, cruz, argentina, this, cave, at, the, foot, of, a, cliff, is, covered, in, wall, paintings, particularly, the, negative, images, of, hundreds, of, hands, believed, to, date, from, around, 8000, bc, based, on, artifacts, found, in, the, region, apparently, hunting, of, guanaco, and, to, a, lesser, extent, rhea, and, were, the, primary, food, sources, of, tribes, living, on, the, eastern, plains, whether, the, megafauna, of, patagonia, including, the, ground, sloth, and, horse, were, extinct, in, the, area, before, the, arrival, of, humans, is, unclear, although, this, is, now, the, more, widely, accepted, account, it, is, also, not, clear, if, domestic, dogs, were, part, of, early, human, activity, bolas, are, commonly, found, and, were, used, to, catch, guanaco, and, rhea, a, maritime, tradition, existed, along, the, pacific, coast, whose, latest, exponents, were, the, yaghan, y, mana, to, the, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, the, kaweshqar, between, taitao, peninsula, and, tierra, del, fuego, and, the, chono, people, in, the, chonos, archipelago, the, selk, nam, haush, and, tehuelche, are, generally, thought, to, be, culturally, and, linguistically, related, peoples, physically, distinct, from, the, sea, faring, peoples, it, is, possible, that, isla, grande, de, tierra, del, fuego, was, connected, to, the, mainland, in, the, early, holocene, c, 9000, years, bp, much, in, the, same, way, that, riesco, island, was, back, then, a, selk, nam, tradition, recorded, by, the, salesian, missionary, giuseppe, mar, a, beauvoir, relate, that, the, selk, nam, arrived, in, tierra, del, fuego, by, land, and, that, the, selk, nam, were, later, unable, to, return, north, as, the, sea, had, flooded, their, crossing, agriculture, was, practised, in, pre, hispanic, argentina, as, far, south, as, southern, mendoza, province, agriculture, was, at, times, practised, beyond, this, limit, in, nearby, areas, of, patagonia, but, populations, reverted, at, times, to, non, agricultural, lifestyles, by, the, time, of, the, spanish, arrival, to, the, area, 1550s, there, is, no, record, of, agriculture, being, practised, in, northern, patagonia, the, extensive, patagonian, grasslands, and, an, associated, abundance, of, guanaco, game, may, have, contributed, for, the, indigenous, populations, to, favour, a, hunter, gathered, lifestyle, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, region, included, the, tehuelches, whose, numbers, and, society, were, reduced, to, near, extinction, not, long, after, the, first, contacts, with, europeans, tehuelches, included, the, gununa, kena, to, the, north, mecharnuekenk, in, south, central, patagonia, and, the, aonikenk, or, southern, tehuelche, in, the, far, south, north, of, the, magellan, strait, on, isla, grande, de, tierra, del, fuego, the, selk, nam, ona, and, haush, manek, enk, lived, in, the, north, and, southeast, respectively, in, the, archipelagos, to, the, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, were, y, mana, with, the, kaw, skar, alakaluf, in, the, coastal, areas, and, islands, in, western, tierra, del, fuego, and, the, southwest, of, the, mainland, in, the, patagonian, archipelagoes, north, of, taitao, peninsula, lived, the, chonos, these, groups, were, encountered, in, the, first, periods, of, european, contact, with, different, lifestyles, body, decoration, and, language, although, it, is, unclear, when, this, configuration, emerged, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, mapuche, speaking, agriculturalists, penetrated, the, western, andes, and, from, there, across, into, the, eastern, plains, and, down, to, the, far, south, through, confrontation, and, technological, ability, they, came, to, dominate, the, other, peoples, of, the, region, in, a, short, period, of, time, and, are, the, principal, indigenous, community, today, navigators, such, as, gon, alo, coelho, and, amerigo, vespucci, possibly, had, reached, the, area, his, own, account, of, 1502, has, it, that, they, reached, the, latitude, 52, s, but, vespucci, s, failure, to, accurately, describe, the, main, geographical, features, of, the, region, such, as, the, r, o, de, la, plata, casts, doubts, on, whether, they, really, did, so, the, first, or, more, detailed, description, of, part, of, the, coastline, of, patagonia, is, possibly, mentioned, in, a, portuguese, voyage, in, 1511, 1512, traditionally, attributed, to, captain, diogo, ribeiro, who, after, his, death, was, replaced, by, estev, o, de, frois, and, was, guided, by, the, pilot, and, cosmographer, jo, o, de, lisboa, the, explorers, after, reaching, rio, de, la, plata, which, they, would, explore, on, the, return, voyage, contacting, the, charr, a, and, other, peoples, eventually, reached, san, matias, gulf, at, 42, s, the, expedition, reported, that, after, going, south, of, the, 40th, parallel, they, found, a, land, or, a, point, extending, into, the, sea, and, further, south, a, gulf, the, expedition, is, said, to, have, rounded, the, gulf, for, nearly, 300, km, 186, mi, and, sighted, the, continent, on, the, southern, side, of, the, gulf, the, atlantic, coast, of, patagonia, was, first, fully, explored, in, 1520, by, the, spanish, expedition, led, by, ferdinand, magellan, who, on, his, passage, along, the, coast, named, many, of, its, more, striking, features, san, mat, as, gulf, cape, of, 11, 000, virgins, now, simply, cape, virgenes, and, others, magellan, s, fleet, spent, a, difficult, winter, at, what, he, named, puerto, san, juli, n, before, resuming, its, voyage, further, south, on, 21, august, 1520, during, this, time, it, encountered, the, local, inhabitants, likely, to, be, tehuelche, people, described, by, his, reporter, antonio, pigafetta, as, giants, called, patagons, the, territory, became, the, spanish, colony, of, the, governorate, of, new, l, on, granted, in, 1529, to, governor, sim, n, de, alcazaba, y, sotomayor, part, of, the, governorates, of, the, spanish, empire, of, the, americas, the, territory, was, redefined, in, 1534, and, consisted, of, the, southernmost, part, of, the, south, american, continent, and, the, islands, towards, antarctica, rodrigo, de, isla, sent, inland, in, 1535, from, san, mat, as, by, sim, n, de, alcazaba, y, sotomayor, on, whom, western, patagonia, had, been, conferred, by, charles, i, of, spain, is, presumed, to, have, been, the, first, european, to, have, traversed, the, great, patagonian, plain, if, the, men, under, his, charge, had, not, mutinied, he, might, have, crossed, the, andes, to, reach, the, pacific, coast, pedro, de, mendoza, on, whom, the, country, was, next, bestowed, founded, buenos, aires, but, did, not, venture, south, alonso, de, camargo, 1539, juan, ladrilleros, 1557, and, hurtado, de, mendoza, 1558, helped, to, make, known, the, pacific, coasts, and, while, sir, francis, drake, s, voyage, in, 1577, down, the, atlantic, coast, through, the, strait, of, magellan, and, northward, along, the, pacific, coast, was, memorable, yet, the, descriptions, of, the, geography, of, patagonia, owe, much, more, to, the, spanish, explorer, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, 1579, 1580, who, devoting, himself, especially, to, the, south, west, region, made, careful, and, accurate, surveys, the, settlements, that, he, founded, at, nombre, de, jes, s, and, san, felipe, was, neglected, by, the, spanish, government, the, latter, being, abandoned, before, thomas, cavendish, visited, it, in, 1587, during, his, circumnavigation, and, so, desolate, that, he, called, it, port, famine, after, the, discovery, of, the, route, around, cape, horn, the, spanish, crown, lost, interest, in, southern, patagonia, until, the, 18th, century, when, the, coastal, settlements, carmen, de, patagones, san, jos, puerto, deseado, and, nueva, colonia, floridablanca, were, established, although, it, maintained, its, claim, of, a, de, jure, sovereignty, over, the, area, in, 1669, the, district, around, puerto, deseado, was, explored, by, john, davis, and, was, claimed, in, 1670, by, sir, john, narborough, for, king, charles, ii, of, england, but, the, english, made, no, attempt, to, establish, settlements, or, explore, the, interior, the, first, european, explorers, of, patagonia, observed, that, the, indigenous, people, in, the, region, were, taller, than, the, average, europeans, of, the, time, prompting, some, of, them, to, believe, that, patagonians, were, giants, according, to, antonio, pigafetta, one, of, the, magellan, expedition, s, few, survivors, and, its, published, chronicler, magellan, bestowed, the, name, patag, o, or, patag, n, on, the, inhabitants, they, encountered, there, and, the, name, patagonia, for, the, region, although, pigafetta, s, account, does, not, describe, how, this, name, came, about, subsequent, popular, interpretations, gave, credence, to, a, derivation, meaning, land, of, the, big, feet, however, this, etymology, is, questionable, the, term, is, most, likely, derived, from, an, actual, character, name, patag, n, a, savage, creature, confronted, by, primale, n, of, greece, the, hero, in, the, homonymous, spanish, chivalry, novel, or, knight, errantry, tale, by, francisco, v, zquez, this, book, published, in, 1512, was, the, sequel, of, the, romance, palmer, n, de, oliva, it, was, much, in, vogue, at, the, time, and, a, favorite, reading, of, magellan, magellan, s, perception, of, the, natives, dressed, in, skins, and, eating, raw, meat, clearly, recalled, the, uncivilized, patag, n, in, v, zquez, s, book, novelist, and, travel, writer, bruce, chatwin, suggests, etymological, roots, of, both, patagon, and, patagonia, in, his, book, in, patagonia, noting, the, similarity, between, patagon, and, the, greek, word, which, means, a, roaring, or, gnashing, of, teeth, in, his, chronicle, pigafetta, describes, the, patagonians, as, roaring, like, bulls, the, main, interest, in, the, region, sparked, by, pigafetta, s, account, came, from, his, reports, of, their, meeting, with, the, local, inhabitants, whom, they, claimed, to, measure, some, 9, to, 12, feet, in, height, so, tall, that, we, reached, only, to, his, waist, hence, the, later, idea, that, patagonia, meant, big, feet, this, supposed, race, of, patagonian, giants, or, patagones, entered, into, the, common, european, perception, of, this, then, little, known, and, distant, area, to, be, further, fueled, by, subsequent, reports, of, other, expeditions, and, famous, travelers, such, as, sir, francis, drake, which, seemed, to, confirm, these, accounts, early, charts, of, the, new, world, sometimes, added, the, legend, regio, gigantum, region, of, the, giants, to, the, patagonian, area, by, 1611, the, patagonian, god, setebos, settaboth, in, pigafetta, was, familiar, to, the, hearers, of, the, tempest, the, concept, and, general, belief, persisted, for, a, further, 250, years, and, was, to, be, sensationally, reignited, in, 1767, when, an, official, but, anonymous, account, was, published, of, commodore, john, byron, s, recent, voyage, of, global, circumnavigation, in, hms, dolphin, byron, and, crew, had, spent, some, time, along, the, coast, and, the, publication, voyage, round, the, world, in, his, majesty, s, ship, the, dolphin, seemed, to, give, proof, positive, of, their, existence, the, publication, became, an, overnight, bestseller, thousands, of, extra, copies, were, to, be, sold, to, a, willing, public, and, other, prior, accounts, of, the, region, were, hastily, republished, even, those, in, which, giant, like, folk, were, not, mentioned, at, all, however, the, patagonian, giant, frenzy, died, down, substantially, only, a, few, years, later, when, some, more, sober, and, analytical, accounts, were, published, in, 1773, john, hawkesworth, published, on, behalf, of, the, admiralty, a, compendium, of, noted, english, southern, hemisphere, explorers, journals, including, that, of, james, cook, and, john, byron, in, this, publication, drawn, from, their, official, logs, the, people, byron, s, expedition, had, encountered, clearly, were, no, taller, than, 6, foot, 6, inch, 1, 98, m, very, tall, but, by, no, means, giants, interest, soon, subsided, although, awareness, of, and, belief, in, the, concept, persisted, in, some, quarters, even, into, the, 20th, century, the, spanish, failure, at, colonizing, the, strait, of, magellan, made, chilo, archipelago, assume, the, role, of, protecting, the, area, of, western, patagonia, from, foreign, intrusions, valdivia, reestablished, in, 1645, and, chilo, acted, as, sentries, being, hubs, where, the, spanish, collected, information, and, rumors, from, all, over, patagonia, as, a, result, of, the, corsair, and, pirate, menace, spanish, authorities, ordered, the, depopulation, of, the, guaitecas, archipelago, to, deprive, enemies, of, any, eventual, support, from, native, populations, this, then, led, to, the, transfer, of, the, majority, of, the, indigenous, chono, population, to, the, chilo, archipelago, in, the, north, while, some, chonos, moved, south, of, taitao, peninsula, effectively, depopulating, the, territory, in, the, 18th, century, the, publication, of, thomas, falkner, s, book, a, description, of, patagonia, and, the, adjacent, parts, of, south, america, in, england, fuelled, speculations, in, spain, about, renewed, british, interest, in, patagonia, in, response, an, order, from, the, king, of, spain, was, issued, to, settle, the, eastern, coast, of, patagonia, this, led, to, the, brief, existence, of, colonies, at, the, gulf, of, san, jorge, 1778, 1779, and, san, juli, n, 1780, 1783, and, the, more, longlasting, colony, of, carmen, de, patagones, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, european, knowledge, of, patagonia, was, further, augmented, by, the, voyages, of, the, previously, mentioned, john, byron, 1764, 1765, samuel, wallis, 1766, in, the, same, hms, dolphin, which, byron, had, earlier, sailed, in, and, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, 1766, thomas, falkner, a, jesuit, who, resided, near, forty, years, in, those, parts, published, his, description, of, patagonia, hereford, 1774, francisco, viedma, founded, el, carmen, nowadays, carmen, de, patagones, and, antonio, settled, the, area, of, san, julian, bay, where, he, founded, the, colony, of, floridablanca, and, advanced, inland, to, the, andes, 1782, basilio, villarino, ascended, the, rio, negro, 1782, two, hydrographic, surveys, of, the, coasts, were, of, first, rate, importance, the, first, expedition, 1826, 1830, included, hms, adventure, and, hms, beagle, under, phillip, parker, king, and, the, second, 1832, 1836, was, the, voyage, of, the, beagle, under, robert, fitzroy, the, latter, expedition, is, particularly, noted, for, the, participation, of, charles, darwin, who, spent, considerable, time, investigating, various, areas, of, patagonia, onshore, including, long, rides, with, gauchos, in, r, o, negro, and, who, joined, fitzroy, in, a, 200, mi, 320, km, expedition, taking, ships, boats, up, the, course, of, the, santa, cruz, river, during, the, independence, wars, rumours, about, the, imminent, arrival, of, spanish, troops, to, patagonia, either, from, peru, or, chilo, were, common, among, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pampas, and, northern, patagonia, in, 1820, chilean, patriot, leader, jos, miguel, carrera, allied, with, the, indigenous, ranquel, people, of, the, pampas, in, order, to, fight, the, rival, patriots, in, buenos, aires, jos, miguel, carrera, ultimately, planned, to, cross, the, andes, into, chile, and, oust, his, rivals, in, chile, the, last, royalist, armed, group, in, what, is, today, argentina, and, chile, the, pincheira, brothers, moved, from, the, vicinities, of, chill, n, across, the, andes, into, northern, patagonia, as, patriots, consolidated, control, of, chile, the, pincheira, brothers, was, an, outlaw, gang, made, of, europeans, spanish, american, spanish, mestizos, and, local, indigenous, peoples, this, group, was, able, to, move, to, patagonia, thanks, to, its, alliance, with, two, indigenous, tribes, the, ranqueles, and, the, boroanos, in, the, interior, of, patagonia, far, from, the, de, facto, territory, of, chile, and, the, united, provinces, the, pincheira, brothers, established, permanent, encampment, with, thousands, of, settlers, from, their, bases, the, pincheiras, led, numerous, raids, into, the, countryside, of, the, newly, established, republics, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, araucanization, of, the, natives, of, northern, patagonia, intensified, and, many, mapuches, migrated, to, patagonia, to, live, as, nomads, that, raised, cattle, or, pillaged, the, argentine, countryside, the, cattle, stolen, in, the, incursions, malones, were, later, taken, to, chile, through, the, mountain, passes, and, traded, for, goods, especially, alcoholic, beverages, the, main, trail, for, this, trade, was, called, camino, de, los, chilenos, and, runs, a, length, around, 1000, km, from, the, buenos, aires, province, to, the, mountain, passes, of, neuqu, n, province, the, lonco, calfucur, crossed, the, andes, from, chile, to, the, pampas, around, 1830, after, a, call, from, the, governor, of, buenos, aires, juan, manuel, de, rosas, to, fight, the, boroano, people, in, 1859, he, attacked, bah, a, blanca, in, argentina, with, 3, 000, warriors, as, in, the, case, of, calfucura, many, other, bands, of, mapuches, got, involved, in, the, internal, conflicts, of, argentina, until, conquest, of, the, desert, to, counter, the, cattle, raids, a, trench, called, the, zanja, de, alsina, was, built, by, argentina, in, the, pampas, in, the, 1870s, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, newly, independent, nations, of, argentina, and, chile, began, an, aggressive, phase, of, expansion, into, the, south, increasing, confrontation, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, region, in, 1860, french, adventurer, orelie, antoine, de, tounens, proclaimed, himself, king, of, the, kingdom, of, araucan, a, and, patagonia, of, the, mapuche, following, the, last, instructions, of, bernardo, o, higgins, the, chilean, president, manuel, bulnes, sent, an, expedition, to, the, strait, of, magellan, and, founded, fuerte, bulnes, in, 1843, five, years, later, the, chilean, government, moved, the, main, settlement, to, the, current, location, of, punta, arenas, the, oldest, permanent, settlement, in, southern, patagonia, the, creation, of, punta, arenas, was, instrumental, in, making, chile, s, claim, of, the, strait, of, magellan, permanent, in, the, 1860s, sheep, from, the, falkland, islands, were, introduced, to, the, lands, around, the, straits, of, magellan, and, throughout, the, 19th, century, sheepfarming, grew, to, be, the, most, important, economic, sector, in, southern, patagonia, george, chaworth, musters, in, 1869, wandered, in, company, with, a, band, of, tehuelches, through, the, whole, length, of, the, country, from, the, strait, to, the, manzaneros, in, the, northwest, and, collected, a, great, deal, of, information, about, the, people, and, their, mode, of, life, argentine, authorities, worried, that, the, strong, connections, araucanized, tribes, had, with, chile, would, allegedly, give, chile, certain, influence, over, the, pampas, argentine, authorities, feared, that, in, an, eventual, war, with, chile, over, patagonia, the, natives, would, side, with, the, chileans, and, the, war, would, be, brought, to, the, vicinity, of, buenos, aires, the, decision, to, plan, and, execute, the, conquest, of, the, desert, was, probably, catalyzed, by, the, 1872, attack, of, cufulcur, and, his, 6, 000, followers, on, the, cities, of, general, alvear, veinticinco, de, mayo, and, nueve, de, julio, where, 300, criollos, were, killed, and, 200, 000, heads, of, cattle, taken, in, the, 1870s, the, conquest, of, the, desert, was, a, controversial, campaign, by, the, argentine, government, executed, mainly, by, general, julio, argentino, roca, to, subdue, or, some, claim, to, exterminate, the, native, peoples, of, the, south, in, 1885, a, mining, expeditionary, party, under, the, romanian, adventurer, julius, popper, landed, in, southern, patagonia, in, search, of, gold, which, they, found, after, traveling, southwards, towards, the, lands, of, tierra, del, fuego, this, led, to, the, further, opening, up, of, the, area, to, prospectors, european, missionaries, and, settlers, arrived, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, notably, the, welsh, settlement, of, the, chubut, valley, numerous, croatians, also, settled, in, patagonia, during, the, first, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, border, between, the, two, nations, in, patagonia, was, established, by, the, mediation, of, the, british, crown, numerous, modifications, have, been, made, since, then, the, last, conflict, having, been, resolved, in, 1994, by, an, arbitration, tribunal, constituted, in, rio, de, janeiro, it, granted, argentina, sovereignty, over, the, southern, patagonia, icefield, cerro, fitz, roy, and, laguna, del, desierto, until, 1902, a, large, proportion, of, patagonia, s, population, were, natives, of, chilo, archipelago, chilotes, who, worked, as, peons, in, large, livestock, farming, estancias, because, they, were, manual, laborers, their, social, status, was, below, that, of, the, gauchos, and, the, argentine, chilean, and, european, landowners, and, administrators, before, and, after, 1902, when, the, boundaries, were, drawn, argentina, expelled, many, chilotes, from, their, territory, as, they, feared, that, having, a, large, chilean, population, in, argentina, could, pose, a, risk, to, their, future, control, these, workers, founded, the, first, inland, chilean, settlement, in, what, is, now, the, ays, n, region,

its, discovery, near, comodoro, rivadavia, in, 1907, energy, production, is, also, a, crucial, part, of, the, local, economy, railways, were, planned, to, cover, continental, argentine, patagonia, to, serve, the, oil, mining, agricultural, and, energy, industries, and, a, line, was, built, connecting, san, carlos, de, bariloche, to, buenos, aires, portions, of, other, lines, were, built, to, the,
