name, galicia, derives, from, the, latin, toponym, callaecia, later, gallaecia, related, to, the, name, of, an, ancient, celtic, tribe, that, resided, north, of, the, douro, river, the, gallaeci, or, callaeci, in, latin, or, o, kalla, ko, in, greek, these, callaeci, were, the, first, tribe, in, the, area, to, help, the, lusitanians, against, the, invading, romans, the, romans, applied, their, name, to, all, the, other, tribes, in, the, northwest, who, spoke, the, same, language, and, lived, the, same, life, the, toponymy, of, the, name, has, been, studied, since, the, 7th, century, by, authors, such, as, isidore, of, seville, who, wrote, that, galicians, are, called, so, because, of, their, fair, skin, as, the, gauls, relating, the, name, to, the, greek, word, for, milk, see, the, etymology, of, the, word, galaxy, in, the, 21st, century, some, scholars, j, j, moralejo, carlos, b, a, have, derived, the, name, of, the, ancient, callaeci, either, from, proto, indo, european, kl, h, no, hill, through, a, local, relational, suffix, aik, also, attested, in, celtiberian, so, meaning, the, hill, people, or, from, proto, celtic, kall, forest, so, meaning, the, forest, people, in, any, case, galicia, being, per, se, a, derivation, of, the, ethnic, name, kallaik, i, means, the, land, of, the, galicians, another, recent, proposal, comes, from, linguist, francesco, benozzo, after, identifying, the, root, gall, kall, in, a, number, of, celtic, words, with, the, meaning, stone, or, rock, as, follows, gall, old, irish, gal, middle, welsh, gailleichan, scottish, gaelic, kailho, breton, galagh, manx, and, gall, gaulish, hence, benozzo, explains, the, ethnonym, callaeci, as, being, the, stone, people, or, the, people, of, the, stone, those, who, work, with, stones, about, the, builders, of, the, ancient, megaliths, and, stone, formations, so, common, in, galicia, the, name, evolved, during, the, middle, ages, from, gallaecia, sometimes, written, galletia, to, gallicia, in, the, 13th, century, with, the, written, emergence, of, the, galician, language, galiza, became, the, most, usual, written, form, of, the, name, of, the, country, being, replaced, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, by, the, current, form, galicia, which, is, also, the, spelling, of, the, name, in, spanish, the, historical, denomination, galiza, became, popular, again, during, the, end, of, the, 19th, and, the, first, three, quarters, of, the, 20th, century, and, is, still, used, with, some, frequency, today, the, xunta, de, galicia, the, local, devolved, government, uses, galicia, the, royal, galician, academy, the, institution, responsible, for, regulating, the, galician, language, whilst, recognizing, galiza, as, a, legitimate, current, denomination, has, stated, that, the, only,

objects, from, the, middle, paleolithic, the, earliest, culture, to, have, left, significant, architectural, traces, is, the, megalithic, culture, which, expanded, along, the, western, european, coasts, during, the, neolithic, and, calcolithic, eras, thousands, of, megalithic, tumuli, are, distributed, throughout, the, country, mostly, along, the, coastal, areas, within, each, tumulus, is, a, stone, burial, chamber, known, locally, as, anta, dolmen, frequently, preceded, by, a, corridor, galicia, was, later, influenced, by, the, bell, beaker, culture, its, rich, mineral, deposits, of, tin,

second, half, of, the, first, millennium, bc, it, is, usually, considered, a, local, evolution, of, the, atlantic, bronze, age, with, later, developments, and, influences, overlapping, into, the, roman, era, geographically, it, corresponds, to, the, people, the, romans, called, gallaeci, which, were, composed, of, a, large, series, of, nations, or, tribes, among, them, the, artabri, bracari, limici, celtici, albiones, and, lemavi, they, were, capable, fighters, strabo, described, them, as, the, most, difficult, foes, the, romans, encountered, in, conquering, lusitania, while, appian,

galicia, mainly, for, its, mineral, resources, most, notably, gold, under, roman, rule, most, galician, hillforts, began, to, be, sometimes, forcibly, abandoned, and, gallaeci, served, frequently, in, the, roman, army, as, auxiliary, troops, romans, brought, new, technologies, new, travel, routes, new, forms, of, organizing, property, and, a, new, language, latin, the, roman, empire, established,

in, corunna, but, the, remoteness, and, lesser, interest, of, the, country, since, the, 2nd, century, ad, when, the, gold, mines, stopped, being, productive, led, to, a, lesser, degree, of, romanization, in, the, 3rd, century, it, was, made, a, province, under, the, name, gallaecia, which, included, also, northern, portugal, asturias, and, a, large, section, of, what, today, is, known, as, castile, and, le, n, in, the, early, 5th, century, the, deep, crisis, suffered, by, the, roman, empire, allowed, different, tribes, of, central, europe, suebi, vandals, and, alani, to, cross, the,

would, settle, peacefully, and, govern, galicia, as, imperial, allies, so, from, 409, galicia, was, taken, by, the, suebi, forming, the, first, medieval, kingdom, to, be, created, in, europe, in, 411, even, before, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, being, also, the, first, germanic, kingdom, to, mint, coinage, in, roman, lands, during, this, period, a, briton, colony, and, bishopric, see, mailoc,

defeated, it, bringing, it, under, visigoth, control, later, the, muslims, invaded, spain, 711, but, the, arabs, and, moors, never, managed, to, have, any, real, control, over, galicia, which, was, later, incorporated, into, the, expanding, christian, kingdom, of, asturias, usually, known, as, gallaecia, or, galicia, yill, qiya, and, gal, siya, by, muslim, chroniclers, as, well, as, by, many, european, contemporaries, this, era, consolidated, galicia, as, a, christian, society, which, spoke, a, romance, language, during, the, next, century, galician, noblemen, took, northern, portugal, conquering, coimbra, in, 871, thus, freeing, what, was, considered, the, southernmost, city, of, ancient, galicia, in, the, 9th, century, the, rise, of, the, cult, of, the, apostle, james, in, santiago, de, compostela, gave, galicia, particular, symbolic, importance, among, christians, an, importance, it, would, hold, throughout, the, reconquista, as, the, middle, ages, went, on, santiago,

own, native, kings, while, vikings, locally, known, as, leodemanes, or, lordomanes, occasionally, raided, the, coasts, the, towers, of, catoira, pontevedra, were, built, as, a, system, of, fortifications, to, prevent, and, stop, the, viking, raids, on, santiago, de, compostela, in, 1063, ferdinand, i, of, castile, divided, his, realm, among, his, sons, and, the, kingdom, of, galicia, was, granted, to, garcia, ii, of, galicia, in, 1072, it, was, forcibly, annexed, by, garcia, s, brother, alfonso, vi, of, le, n, from, that, time, galicia, was, united, with, the, kingdom, of, le, n, under, the, same, monarchs, in, the, 13th, century, alfonso, x, of, castile, standardized, the, castilian, language, i, e, spanish, and, made, it, the, language, of, court, and, government, nevertheless, in, his, kingdom, of, galicia, the, galician, language, was, the, only, language, spoken, and, the, most, used, in, government, and, legal, uses, as, well, as, in, literature, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, progressive, distancing, of, the, kings, from, galician, affairs, left, the, kingdom, in, the, hands, of, the, local, knights, counts, and, bishops, who, frequently, fought, each, other, to, increase, their, fiefs, or, simply, to, plunder, the, lands, of, others, at, the, same, time, the, deputies, of, the, kingdom, in, the, cortes, stopped, being, called, the, kingdom, of, galicia, slipping, away, from, the, control, of, the, king, responded, with, a, century, of, fiscal, insubordination, on, the, other, hand, the, lack, of, an, effective, royal, justice, system, in, the, kingdom, led, to, the, social, conflict, known, as, the, guerras, irmandi, as, wars, of, the, brotherhoods, when, leagues, of, peasants, and, burghers, with, the, support, of, several, knights, noblemen, and, under, legal, protection, offered, by, the, remote, king, toppled, many, of, the, castles, of, the, kingdom, and, briefly, drove, the, noblemen, into, portugal, and, castile, soon, after, in, the, late, 15th, century, in, the, dynastic, conflict, between, isabella, i, of, castile, and, joanna, la, beltraneja, part, of, the, galician, aristocracy, supported, joanna, after, isabella, s, victory, she, initiated, an, administrative, and, political, reform, which, the, chronicler, jeronimo, zurita, defined, as, doma, del, reino, de, galicia, it, was, then, when, the, taming, of, galicia, began, because, not, just, the, local, lords, and, knights, but, all, the, people, of, that, nation, were, the, ones, against, the, others, very, bold, and, warlike, these, reforms, while, establishing, a, local, government, and, tribunal, the, real, audiencia, del, reino, de, galicia, and, bringing, the, nobleman, under, submission, also, brought, most, galician, monasteries, and, institutions, under, castilian, control, in, what, has, been, criticized, as, a, process, of, centralisation, at, the, same, time, the, kings, began, to, call, the, xunta, or, cortes, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, an, assembly, of, deputies, or, representatives, of, the, cities, of, the, kingdom, to, ask, for, monetary, and, military, contributions, this, assembly, soon, developed, into, the, voice, and, legal, representation, of, the, kingdom, and, the, depositary, of, its, will, and, laws, the, modern, period, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, began, with, the, defeat, of, some, of, the, most, powerful, galician, lords, such, as, pedro, lvarez, de, sotomayor, called, pedro, madruga, and, rodrigo, henriquez, osorio, at, the, hands, of, the, castilian, armies, sent, to, galicia, between, the, years, 1480, and, 1486, isabella, i, of, castile, considered, a, usurper, by, many, galician, nobles, defeated, all, armed, resistance, and, definitively, established, the, royal, power, of, the, castilian, monarchy, fearing, a, general, revolt, the, monarchs, ordered, the, banishing, of, the, rest, of, the, great, lords, like, pedro, de, bola, o, diego, de, andrade, or, lope, s, nchez, de, moscoso, among, others, the, establishment, of, the, santa, hermandad, in, 1480, and, the, real, audiencia, del, reino, de, galicia, in, 1500, a, tribunal, and, executive, body, directed, by, the, governor, captain, general, as, a, direct, representative, of, the, king, implied, initially, the, submission, of, the, kingdom, to, the, crown, after, a, century, of, unrest, and, fiscal, insubordination, as, a, result, from, 1480, to, 1520, the, kingdom, of, galicia, contributed, more, than, 10, of, the, total, earnings, of, the, crown, of, castille, including, the, americas, well, over, its, economic, relevance, like, the, rest, of, spain, the, 16th, century, was, marked, by, population, growth, up, to, 1580, when, the, simultaneous, wars, with, the, netherlands, france, and, england, hampered, galicia, s, atlantic, commerce, which, consisted, mostly, in, the, exportation, of, sardines, wood, and, some, cattle, and, wine, in, the, late, years, of, the, 15th, century, the, written, form, of, the, galician, language, began, a, slow, decline, as, it, was, increasingly, replaced, by, spanish, which, would, culminate, in, the, s, culos, escuros, the, dark, centuries, of, the, language, roughly, from, the, 16th, century, through, to, the, mid, 18th, century, when, written, galician, almost, completely, disappeared, except, for, private, or, occasional, uses, but, the, spoken, language, remained, the, common, language, of, the, people, in, the, villages, and, even, the, cities, from, that, moment, galicia, which, participated, to, a, minor, extent, in, the, american, expansion, of, the, spanish, empire, found, itself, at, the, center, of, the, atlantic, wars, fought, by, spain, against, the, french, and, the, protestant, powers, of, england, and, the, netherlands, whose, privateers, attacked, the, coastal, areas, but, major, assaults, were, not, common, as, the, coastline, was, difficult, and, the, harbors, easily, defended, the, most, famous, assaults, were, upon, the, city, of, vigo, by, sir, francis, drake, in, 1585, and, 1589, and, the, siege, of, a, coru, a, in, 1589, by, the, english, armada, galicia, also, suffered, occasional, slave, raids, by, barbary, pirates, but, not, as, frequently, as, the, mediterranean, coastal, areas, the, most, famous, barbary, attack, was, the, bloody, sack, of, the, town, of, cangas, in, 1617, at, the, time, the, king, s, petitions, for, money, and, troops, became, more, frequent, due, to, the, human, and, economic, exhaustion, of, castile, the, junta, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, the, local, cortes, or, representative, assembly, was, initially, receptive, to, these, petitions, raising, large, sums, accepting, the, conscription, of, the, men, of, the, kingdom, and, even, commissioning, a, new, naval, squadron, which, was, sustained, with, the, incomes, of, the, kingdom, after, the, rupture, of, the, wars, with, portugal, and, catalonia, the, junta, changed, its, attitude, this, time, due, to, the, exhaustion, of, galicia, now, involved, not, just, in, naval, or, oversea, operations, but, also, in, an, exhausting, war, with, the, portuguese, war, which, produced, thousands, of, casualties, and, refugees, and, was, heavily, disturbing, to, the, local, economy, and, commerce, so, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, junta, frequently, denied, or, considerably, reduced, the, initial, petitions, of, the, monarch, and, though, the, tension, did, not, rise, to, the, levels, experienced, in, portugal, or, catalonia, there, were, frequent, urban, mutinies, and, some, voices, even, asked, for, the, secession, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, during, the, peninsular, war, the, successful, uprising, of, the, local, people, against, the, new, french, authorities, together, with, the, support, of, the, british, army, limited, the, occupation, to, six, months, in, 1808, 1809, during, the, pre, war, period, the, supreme, council, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, junta, suprema, del, reino, de, galicia, auto, proclaimed, interim, sovereign, in, 1808, was, the, sole, government, of, the, country,

centralized, monarchy, instead, of, seven, provinces, and, a, regional, administration, galicia, was, reorganized, into, the, current, four, provinces, although, it, was, recognized, as, a, historical, region, that, status, was, strictly, honorific, in, reaction, nationalist, and, federalist, movements, arose, the, liberal, general, miguel, sol, s, cuetos, led, a, separatist, coup, attempt, in, 1846, against, the, authoritarian, regime, of, ram, n, mar, a, narv, ez, sol, s, and, his, forces, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, cacheiras, 23, april, 1846, and, the, survivors, including, sol, s, himself, were, shot, they, have, taken, their, place, in, galician, memory, as, the, martyrs, of, carral, or, simply, the, martyrs, of, liberty, defeated, on, the, military, front,
