the, brahmaputra, is, a, trans, boundary, river, which, flows, through, southwestern, china, northeastern, india, and, bangladesh, it, is, known, as, brahmaputra, or, luit, in, assamese, yarlung, tsangpo, in, tibetan, the, siang, dihang, river, in, arunachali, and, jamuna, river, in, bengali, it, is, the, 9th, largest, river, in, the, world, by, discharge, and, the, 15th, longest, it, originates, in, the, manasarovar, lake, region, near, mount, kailash, on, the, northern, side, of, the, himalayas, in, burang, county, of, tibet, where, it, is, known, as, the, yarlung, tsangpo, river, the, brahmaputra, flows, along, southern, tibet, to, break, through, the, himalayas, in, great, gorges, including, the, yarlung, tsangpo, grand, canyon, and, into, arunachal, pradesh, it, enters, india, near, the, village, of, gelling, in, arunachal, pradesh, and, flows, southwest, through, the, assam, valley, as, the, brahmaputra, and, south, through, bangladesh, as, the, jamuna, not, to, be, confused, with, the, yamuna, of, india, in, the, vast, ganges, delta, it, merges, with, the, ganges, popularly, known, as, the, padma, in, bangladesh, and, becomes, the, meghna, and, ultimately, empties, into, the, bay, of, bengal, at, 3, 000, km, 1, 900, mi, long, the, brahmaputra, is, an, important, river, for, irrigation, and, transportation, in, the, region, the, average, depth, of, the, river, is, 30, m, 100, ft, and, its, maximum, depth, is, 135, m, 440, ft, at, sadiya, the, river, is, prone, to, catastrophic, flooding, in, the, spring, when, the, himalayan, snow, melts, the, average, discharge, of, the, brahmaputra, is, about, 22, 000, m, 3, s, 780, 000, cu, ft, s, and, floods, reach, about, 103, 000, m, 3, s, 3, 600, 000, cu, ft, s, it, is, a, classic, example, of, a, braided, river, and, is, highly, susceptible, to, channel, migration, and, avulsion, it, is, also, one, of, the, few, rivers, in, the, world, that, exhibits, a, tidal, bore, it, is, navigable, for, most, of, its, length, the, brahmaputra, drains, the, himalayas, east, of, the, indo, nepal, border, south, central, portion, of, the, tibetan, plateau, above, the, ganga, basin, south, eastern, portion, of, tibet, the, patkai, hills, the, northern, slopes, of, the, meghalaya, hills, the, assam, plains, and, northern, bangladesh, the, basin, especially, south, of, tibet, is, characterized, by, high, levels, of, rainfall, kangchenjunga, 8, 586, m, is, the, only, peak, above, 8, 000, m, and, hence, is, the, highest, point, within, the, brahmaputra, basin, the, brahmaputra, s, upper, course, was, long, unknown, and, its, identity, with, the, yarlung, tsangpo, was, only, established, by, exploration, in, 1884, 86, the, river, is, often, called, the, tsangpo, brahmaputra, river, the, lower, reaches, are, sacred, to, hindus, while, most, rivers, on, the, indian, subcontinent, have, female, names, this, river, has, a, rare, male, name, brahmaputra, means, son, of, brahma, in, sanskrit, it, is, known, by, various, names, in, different, regional, languages, br, hm, putr, in, assamese, tibetan, wylie, yar, klung, gtsang, po, yarlung, tsangpo, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, b, l, m, p, t, l, h, it, is, also, called, tsangpo, brahmaputra, and, red, river, of, india, when, referring, to, the, whole, river, including, the, stretch, within, the, tibet, autonomous, region, in, its, tibetan, and, indian, names, the, river, is, unusually, masculine, in, gender, the, upper, reaches, of, the, brahmaputra, river, known, as, the, yarlung, tsangpo, from, the, tibetan, language, originates, on, the, angsi, glacier, near, mount, kailash, located, on, the, northern, side, of, the, himalayas, in, burang, county, of, tibet, the, source, of, the, river, was, earlier, thought, to, be, on, the, chemayungdung, glacier, which, covers, the, slopes, of, the, himalayas, about, 60, mi, 97, km, southeast, of, lake, manasarovar, in, southwestern, tibet, from, its, source, the, river, runs, for, nearly, 1, 100, km, 680, mi, in, a, generally, easterly, direction, between, the, main, range, of, the, himalayas, to, the, south, and, the, kailas, range, to, the, north, in, tibet, the, tsangpo, receives, a, number, of, tributaries, the, most, important, left, bank, tributaries, are, the, raka, zangbo, raka, tsangpo, which, joins, the, river, west, of, xigaz, shigatse, and, the, lhasa, kyi, which, flows, past, the, tibetan, capital, of, lhasa, and, joins, the, tsangpo, at, q, x, the, nyang, river, joins, the, tsangpo, from, the, north, at, zela, tsela, dzong, on, the, right, bank, a, second, river, called, the, nyang, qu, nyang, chu, meets, the, tsangpo, at, xigaz, after, passing, pi, pe, in, tibet, the, river, turns, suddenly, to, the, north, and, northeast, and, cuts, a, course, through, a, succession, of, great, narrow, gorges, between, the, mountainous, massifs, of, gyala, peri, and, namcha, barwa, in, a, series, of, rapids, and, cascades, thereafter, the, river, turns, south, and, southwest, and, flows, through, a, deep, gorge, the, yarlung, tsangpo, grand, canyon, across, the, eastern, extremity, of, the, himalayas, with, canyon, walls, that, extend, upward, for, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, and, more, on, each, side, during, that, stretch, the, river, crosses, the, china, india, line, of, actual, control, to, enter, northern, arunachal, pradesh, where, it, is, known, as, the, dihang, or, siang, river, and, turns, more, southerly, the, yarlung, tsangpo, leaves, the, part, of, tibet, to, enter, indian, state, of, arunachal, pradesh, where, the, river, is, called, siang, it, makes, a, very, rapid, descent, from, its, original, height, in, tibet, and, finally, appears, in, the, plains, where, it, is, called, dihang, it, flows, for, about, 35, km, 22, mi, southward, after, which, it, is, joined, by, the, dibang, river, and, the, lohit, river, at, the, head, of, the, assam, valley, below, the, lohit, the, river, is, called, brahmaputra, and, doima, mother, of, water, and, burlung, buthur, by, native, bodo, tribals, it, then, enters, the, state, of, assam, and, becomes, very, wide, as, wide, as, 20, km, 12, mi, in, parts, of, assam, the, reason, for, such, an, unusual, course, and, drastic, change, is, that, the, river, is, antecedent, to, the, himalayas, meaning, that, it, had, existed, before, them, and, has, entrenched, itself, since, they, started, rising, the, dihang, winding, out, of, the, mountains, turns, towards, the, southeast, and, descends, into, a, low, lying, basin, as, it, enters, northeastern, assam, state, just, west, of, the, town, of, sadiya, the, river, again, turns, to, the, southwest, and, is, joined, by, two, mountain, streams, the, lohit, and, the, dibang, below, that, confluence, about, 1, 450, km, 900, mi, from, the, bay, of, bengal, the, river, becomes, known, conventionally, as, the, brahmaputra, son, of, brahma, in, assam, the, river, is, mighty, even, in, the, dry, season, and, during, the, rains, its, banks, are, more, than, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, apart, as, the, river, follows, its, braided, 700, km, 430, mi, course, through, the, valley, it, receives, several, rapidly, flowing, himalayan, streams, including, the, subansiri, kameng, bhareli, dhansiri, manas, champamati, saralbhanga, and, sankosh, rivers, the, main, tributaries, from, the, hills, and, from, the, plateau, to, the, south, are, the, burhi, dihing, the, disang, the, dikhu, and, the, kopili, between, dibrugarh, and, lakhimpur, districts, the, river, divides, into, two, channels, the, northern, kherkutia, channel, and, the, southern, brahmaputra, channel, the, two, channels, join, again, about, 100, km, 62, mi, downstream, forming, the, majuli, island, which, is, the, largest, river, island, in, the, world, at, guwahati, near, the, ancient, pilgrimage, centre, of, hajo, the, brahmaputra, cuts, through, the, rocks, of, the, shillong, plateau, and, is, at, its, narrowest, at, 1, km, 1, 100, yd, bank, to, bank, the, terrain, of, this, area, made, it, logistically, ideal, for, the, battle, of, saraighat, the, military, confrontation, between, the, mughal, empire, and, the, ahom, kingdom, in, march, 1671, the, first, combined, railroad, roadway, bridge, across, the, brahmaputra, was, constructed, at, saraighat, it, was, opened, to, traffic, in, april, 1962, the, environment, of, the, brahmaputra, floodplains, in, assam, have, been, described, as, the, brahmaputra, valley, semi, evergreen, forests, ecoregion, in, bangladesh, the, brahmaputra, is, joined, by, the, teesta, river, or, tista, one, of, its, largest, tributaries, below, the, tista, the, brahmaputra, splits, into, two, distributary, branches, the, western, branch, which, contains, the, majority, of, the, river, s, flow, continues, due, south, as, the, jamuna, jomuna, to, merge, with, the, lower, ganga, called, the, padma, river, p, dma, the, eastern, branch, formerly, the, larger, but, now, much, smaller, is, called, the, lower, or, old, brahmaputra, brommoputro, it, curves, southeast, to, join, the, meghna, river, near, dhaka, the, padma, and, meghna, converge, near, chandpur, and, flow, out, into, the, bay, of, bengal, this, final, part, of, the, river, is, called, meghna, the, brahmaputra, enters, the, plains, of, bangladesh, after, turning, south, around, the, garo, hills, below, dhuburi, india, after, flowing, past, chilmari, bangladesh, it, is, joined, on, its, right, bank, by, the, tista, river, and, then, follows, a, 240, km, 150, mi, course, due, south, as, the, jamuna, river, south, of, gaibanda, the, old, brahmaputra, leaves, the, left, bank, of, the, mainstream, and, flows, past, jamalpur, and, mymensingh, to, join, the, meghna, river, at, bhairab, bazar, before, its, confluence, with, the, ganga, the, jamuna, receives, the, combined, waters, of, the, baral, atrai, and, hurasagar, rivers, on, its, right, bank, and, becomes, the, point, of, departure, of, the, large, dhaleswari, river, on, its, left, bank, a, tributary, of, the, dhaleswari, the, buriganga, old, ganga, flows, past, dhaka, the, capital, of, bangladesh, and, joins, the, meghna, river, above, munshiganj, the, jamuna, joins, with, the, ganga, north, of, goalundo, ghat, below, which, as, the, padma, their, combined, waters, flow, to, the, southeast, for, a, distance, of, about, 120, km, 75, mi, after, several, smaller, channels, branch, off, to, feed, the, ganga, brahmaputra, delta, to, the, south, the, main, body, of, the, padma, reaches, its, confluence, with, the, meghna, river, near, chandpur, and, then, enters, the, bay, of, bengal, through, the, meghna, estuary, and, lesser, channels, flowing, through, the, delta, the, growth, of, the, ganga, brahmaputra, delta, is, dominated, by, tidal, processes, the, ganga, delta, fed, by, the, waters, of, numerous, rivers, including, the, ganga, and, brahmaputra, is, 105, 000, km, 2, 41, 000, sq, mi, one, of, the, largest, river, deltas, in, the, world, the, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, system, has, the, second, greatest, average, discharge, of, the, world, s, rivers, roughly, 44, 000, m, 3, s, 1, 600, 000, cu, ft, s, and, the, river, brahmaputra, alone, supplies, about, 50, of, the, total, discharge, the, rivers, combined, suspended, sediment, load, of, about, 1, 87, billion, tonnes, 1, 84, billion, tons, per, year, is, the, world, s, highest, in, the, past, the, lower, course, of, the, brahmaputra, was, different, and, passed, through, the, jamalpur, and, mymensingh, districts, in, an, 8, 8, magnitude, earthquake, on, 2, april, 1762, however, the, main, channel, of, the, brahmaputra, at, bhahadurabad, point, was, switched, southwards, and, opened, as, jamuna, due, to, the, result, of, tectonic, uplift, of, the, madhupur, tract, rising, temperature, is, one, of, the, major, causes, of, snow, melting, at, the, upper, brahmaputra, catchment, the, discharge, of, the, river, brahmaputra, is, highly, affected, by, the, melting, of, snow, at, the, upper, part, of, its, catchment, then, of, river, flow, due, to, the, melting, of, snow, in, the, river, brahmaputra, basin, affects, the, downstream, discharge, of, the, river, this, increase, in, discharge, due, to, the, significant, retreat, of, snow, gives, rise, to, severe, catastrophic, problems, such, as, flood, and, erosion, the, brahmaputra, river, is, characterized, by, its, significant, rates, of, sediment, discharge, the, large, and, variable, flows, along, with, its, rapid, channel, aggradations, and, accelerated, rates, of, basin, denudation, over, time, the, deepening, of, the, bengal, basin, caused, by, erosion, will, result, in, the, increase, in, hydraulic, radius, and, hence, allowing, for, the, huge, accumulation, of, sediments, fed, from, the, himalayan, erosion, by, efficient, sediment, transportation, the, thickness, of, the, sediment, accumulated, above, the, precambrian, basement, has, increased, over, the, years, from, a, few, hundred, meters, to, over, 18, km, 11, mi, in, the, bengal, fore, deep, to, the, south, the, ongoing, subsidence, of, the, bengal, basin, and, the, high, rate, of, himalayan, uplift, continues, to, contribute, to, the, large, water, and, sediment, discharges, of, fine, sand, and, silt, with, 1, clay, in, the, brahmaputra, river, climatic, change, plays, a, crucial, role, in, affecting, the, basin, hydrology, throughout, the, year, there, is, a, significant, rise, in, hydrograph, with, a, broad, peak, between, july, and, september, the, brahmaputra, river, experiences, two, high, water, seasons, one, in, early, summer, caused, by, snowmelt, in, the, mountains, and, one, in, late, summer, caused, by, runoff, from, monsoon, rains, the, river, flow, is, strongly, influenced, by, snow, and, ice, melting, of, the, glaciers, which, are, located, mainly, on, the, eastern, himalaya, regions, in, the, upstream, parts, of, the, basin, the, snow, and, glacier, melt, contribution, to, the, total, annual, runoff, is, about, 27, while, the, annual, rainfall, contributes, to, about, 1, 9, m, 6, ft, 3, in, and, 22, 000, m, 3, s, 780, 000, cu, ft, s, of, discharge, the, highest, recorded, daily, discharge, in, the, brahmaputra, at, pandu, was, 72, 726, m, 3, s, 2, 568, 300, cu, ft, s, august, 1962, while, the, lowest, was, 1, 757, m, 3, s, 62, 000, cu, ft, s, in, february, 1968, the, increased, rates, of, snow, and, glacial, melt, are, likely, to, increase, summer, flows, in, some, river, systems, for, a, few, decades, followed, by, a, reduction, in, flow, as, the, glaciers, disappear, and, snowfall, diminishes, this, is, particularly, true, for, the, dry, season, when, water, availability, is, crucial, for, the, irrigation, systems, the, course, of, the, brahmaputra, river, has, changed, drastically, in, the, past, two, and, a, half, centuries, moving, its, river, course, westwards, for, a, distance, of, about, 80, km, 50, mi, leaving, its, old, river, course, appropriately, named, the, old, brahmaputra, river, behind, in, the, past, the, floodplain, of, the, old, river, course, had, soils, which, were, more, properly, formed, compared, to, graded, sediments, on, the, operating, jamuna, river, this, change, of, river, course, resulted, in, modifications, to, the, soil, forming, process, which, include, acidification, the, breakdown, of, clays, and, buildup, of, organic, matter, with, the, soils, showing, an, increasing, amount, of, biotic, homogenization, mottling, the, coating, around, peds, and, maturing, soil, arrangement, shape, and, pattern, in, the, future, the, consequences, of, local, ground, subsidence, coupled, with, flood, prevention, propositions, for, instance, localised, breakwaters, that, increase, flood, plain, water, depths, outside, the, water, breakers, may, alter, the, water, levels, of, the, floodplains, throughout, the, years, bars, scroll, bars, and, sand, dunes, are, formed, at, the, edge, of, the, flood, plain, by, deposition, the, height, difference, of, the, channel, topography, is, often, not, more, than, 1, 2, m, 3, 7, ft, furthermore, flooding, over, the, history, of, the, river, has, caused, the, formation, of, river, levees, due, to, deposition, from, the, overbank, flow, the, height, difference, between, the, levee, top, and, the, surrounding, floodplains, is, typically, 1, m, 3, ft, along, small, channels, and, 2, 3, m, 7, 10, ft, along, major, channels, crevasse, splay, a, sedimentary, fluvial, deposit, which, forms, when, a, stream, breaks, its, natural, or, artificial, levees, and, deposits, sediment, on, a, floodplain, are, often, formed, due, to, a, breach, in, the, levee, forming, a, lobe, of, sediments, which, progrades, onto, the, adjacent, floodplain, lastly, flood, basins, are, often, formed, between, the, levees, of, adjacent, rivers, during, the, monsoon, season, june, october, floods, are, a, very, common, occurrence, deforestation, in, the, brahmaputra, watershed, has, resulted, in, increased, siltation, levels, flash, floods, and, soil, erosion, in, critical, downstream, habitat, such, as, the, kaziranga, national, park, in, middle, assam, occasionally, massive, flooding, causes, huge, losses, to, crops, life, and, property, periodic, flooding, is, a, natural, phenomenon, which, is, ecologically, important, because, it, helps, maintain, the, lowland, grasslands, and, associated, wildlife, periodic, floods, also, deposit, fresh, alluvium, replenishing, the, fertile, soil, of, the, brahmaputra, river, valley, thus, flooding, agriculture, and, agricultural, practices, are, closely, connected, the, effects, of, flooding, can, be, devastating, and, cause, significant, damage, to, crops, and, houses, serious, bank, erosive, with, consequent, loss, of, homesteads, school, and, land, and, loss, of, many, lives, livestock, and, fisheries, during, the, 1998, flood, over, 70, of, the, land, area, of, bangladesh, was, inundated, affecting, 31, million, people, and, 1, million, homesteads, in, the, 1998, flood, which, had, an, unusually, long, duration, from, july, to, september, claimed, 918, human, lives, and, was, responsible, for, damaging, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, of, roads, and, 6, 000, km, 3, 700, mi, embankments, and, affecting, 6, 000, km, 2, 2, 300, sq, mi, of, standing, crops, the, 2004, floods, over, 25, of, the, population, of, bangladesh, or, 36, million, people, were, affected, by, the, floods, 800, people, died, 952, 000, houses, were, destroyed, and, 1, 4, million, were, badly, damaged, 24, 000, educational, institutions, were, affected, including, the, destruction, of, 1200, primary, schools, 2, million, governments, and, private, tube, wells, were, affected, over, 3, million, latrines, were, damaged, or, washed, away, this, increases, the, risks, of, waterborne, diseases, including, diarrhea, and, cholera, also, 1, 1, million, ha, 2, 7, million, acres, of, the, rice, crop, was, submerged, and, lost, before, it, could, be, harvested, with, 7, of, the, yearly, aus, early, season, rice, crop, lost, 270, 000, ha, 670, 000, acres, of, grazing, land, was, affected, 5600, livestock, perished, together, with, 254, 00, poultry, and, 63, million, tonnes, 69, million, short, tons, of, lost, fish, production, flood, control, measures, are, taken, by, the, water, resource, department, and, the, brahmaputra, board, but, until, now, the, flood, problem, remains, unsolved, at, least, a, third, of, the, land, of, majuli, island, has, been, eroded, by, the, river, recently, it, is, suggested, that, a, highway, protected, by, concrete, mat, along, the, river, bank, and, excavation, of, the, river, bed, can, curb, this, menace, this, project, named, the, brahmaputra, river, restoration, project, is, yet, to, be, implemented, by, the, government, recently, the, central, government, approved, the, construction, of, brahmaputra, express, highways, the, course, of, the, brahmaputra, river, has, changed, dramatically, over, the, past, 250, years, with, evidence, of, large, scale, avulsion, in, the, period, 1776, 1850, of, 80, km, 50, mi, from, east, of, the, madhupur, tract, to, the, west, of, it, prior, to, 1843, the, brahmaputra, flowed, within, the, channel, now, termed, the, old, brahmaputra, the, banks, of, the, river, are, mostly, weakly, cohesive, sand, and, silts, which, usually, erodes, through, large, scale, slab, failure, where, previously, deposited, materials, undergo, scour, and, bank, erosion, during, flood, periods, presently, the, river, s, erosion, rate, has, decreased, to, 30, m, 98, ft, per, year, as, compared, to, 150, m, 490, ft, per, year, from, 1973, to, 1992, this, erosion, has, however, destroyed, so, much, land, that, it, has, caused, 0, 7, million, people, to, become, homeless, due, to, loss, of, land, several, studies, have, discussed, the, reasons, for, the, avulsion, of, the, river, into, its, present, course, and, have, suggested, a, number, of, reasons, including, tectonic, activity, switches, in, the, upstream, course, of, the, teesta, river, the, influence, of, increased, discharge, catastrophic, floods, and, river, capture, into, an, old, river, course, from, an, analysis, of, maps, of, the, river, between, 1776, and, 1843, it, was, concluded, in, a, study, that, the, river, avulsion, was, more, likely, gradual, than, catastrophic, and, sudden, and, may, have, been, generated, by, bank, erosion, perhaps, around, a, large, mid, channel, bar, causing, a, diversion, of, the, channel, into, the, existing, floodplain, channel, the, brahmaputra, channel, is, governed, by, the, peak, and, low, flow, periods, during, which, its, bed, undergoes, tremendous, modification, the, brahmaputra, s, bank, line, migration, is, inconsistent, with, time, the, brahmaputra, river, bed, has, widened, significantly, since, 1916, and, appears, to, be, shifting, more, towards, the, south, than, towards, the, north, together, with, the, contemporary, slow, migration, of, the, river, the, left, bank, is, being, eroded, away, faster, than, the, right, bank, the, brahmaputra, river, experiences, high, levels, of, bank, erosion, usually, via, slab, failure, and, channel, migration, caused, by, its, strong, current, lack, of, riverbank, vegetation, and, loose, sand, and, silt, which, compose, its, banks, it, is, thus, difficult, to, build, permanent, structures, on, the, river, and, protective, structures, designed, to, limit, the, river, s, erosional, effects, often, face, numerous, issues, during, and, after, construction, in, fact, a, 2004, report, by, the, bangladesh, disaster, and, emergency, sub, group, bder, has, stated, that, several, of, such, protective, systems, have, just, failed, however, some, progress, has, been, made, in, the, form, of, construction, works, which, stabilize, sections, of, the, river, albeit, with, the, need, for, heavy, maintenance, the, bangabandhu, bridge, the, only, bridge, to, span, the, river, s, major, distributary, the, jamuna, was, thus, opened, in, june, 1998, constructed, at, a, narrow, braid, belt, of, the, river, it, is, 4, 8, km, 3, 0, mi, long, with, a, platform, 18, 5, m, 61, ft, wide, and, it, is, used, to, carry, railroad, traffic, as, well, as, gas, power, and, telecommunication, lines, due, to, the, variable, nature, of, the, river, the, prediction, of, the, river, s, future, course, is, crucial, in, planning, upstream, engineering, to, prevent, flooding, on, the, bridge, china, had, built, the, zangmu, dam, in, the, upper, course, of, the, brahmaputra, river, in, the, tibet, region, and, it, was, operationalised, on, 13, october, 2015, the, main, tributaries, from, the, mouth, tributary, tributary, km, km, 2, m, 3, s, sunkosh, bhareli, siyom, matsang, tsangpo, period, 1971, 2000, the, kachari, group, called, the, river, dilao, tilao, early, greek, accounts, of, curtius, and, strabo, give, its, name, as, dyardanes, ancient, greek, and, oidanes, in, the, past, the, course, of, the, lower, brahmaputra, was, different, and, passed, through, the, jamalpur, and, mymensingh, districts, some, water, still, flows, through, that, course, now, called, the, old, brahmaputra, as, a, distributary, of, the, main, channel, a, question, about, the, river, system, in, bangladesh, is, when, and, why, the, brahmaputra, changed, its, main, course, at, the, site, of, the, jamuna, and, the, old, brahmaputra, fork, that, can, be, seen, by, comparing, modern, maps, to, historic, maps, before, the, 1800s, the, brahmaputra, likely, flowed, directly, south, along, its, present, main, channel, for, much, of, the, time, since, the, last, glacial, maximum, switching, back, and, forth, between, the, two, courses, several, times, throughout, the, holocene, one, idea, about, the, most, recent, avulsion, is, that, the, change, in, the, course, of, the, main, waters, of, the, brahmaputra, took, place, suddenly, in, 1787, the, year, of, the, heavy, flooding, of, the, river, tista, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, at, least, three, fair, sized, streams, flowed, between, the, rajshahi, and, dhaka, divisions, viz, the, daokoba, a, branch, of, the, tista, the, monash, or, konai, and, the, salangi, the, lahajang, and, the, elengjany, were, also, important, rivers, in, renault, s, time, the, brahmaputra, as, a, first, step, towards, securing, a, more, direct, course, to, the, sea, by, leaving, the, mahdupur, jungle, to, the, east, began, to, send, a, considerable, volume, of, water, down, the, jinai, or, jabuna, from, jamalpur, into, the, monash, and, salangi, these, rivers, gradually, coalesced, and, kept, shifting, to, the, west, till, they, met, the, daokoba, which, was, showing, an, equally, rapid, tendency, to, cut, towards, the, east, the, junction, of, these, rivers, gave, the, brahmaputra, a, course, worthy, of, her, immense, power, and, the, rivers, to, right, and, left, silted, up, in, renault, s, altas, they, very, much, resemble, the, rivers, of, jessore, which, dried, up, after, the, hundred, mouthed, ganga, had, cut, her, new, channel, to, join, the, meghna, at, the, south, of, the, munshiganj, subdivision, in, 1809, francis, buchanan, hamilton, wrote, that, the, new, channel, between, bhawanipur, and, dewanranj, was, scarcely, inferior, to, the, mighty, river, and, threatens, to, sweep, away, the, intermediate, country, by, 1830, the, old, channel, had, been, reduced, to, its, present, insignificance, it, was, navigable, by, country, boats, throughout, the, year, and, by, launches, only, during, rains, but, at, the, point, as, low, as, jamalpur, it, was, formidable, throughout, the, cold, weather, similar, was, the, position, for, two, or, three, months, just, below, mymensingh, also, the, waters, of, the, river, brahmaputra, are, shared, by, tibet, india, and, bangladesh, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, there, was, repeated, speculation, that, mentioned, chinese, plans, to, build, a, dam, at, the, great, bend, with, a, view, to, diverting, the, waters, to, the, north, of, the, country, this, has, been, denied, by, the, chinese, government, for, many, years, at, the, kathmandu, workshop, of, strategic, foresight, group, in, august, 2009, on, water, security, in, the, himalayan, region, which, brought, together, in, a, rare, development, leading, hydrologists, from, the, basin, countries, the, chinese, scientists, argued, that, it, was, not, feasible, for, china, to, undertake, such, a, diversion, however, on, 22, april, 2010, china, confirmed, that, it, was, indeed, building, the, zangmu, dam, on, the, brahmaputra, in, tibet, but, assured, india, that, the, project, would, not, have, any, significant, effect, on, the, downstream, flow, to, india, this, claim, has, also, been, reiterated, by, the, government, of, india, in, an, attempt, to, assuage, domestic, criticism, of, chinese, dam, construction, on, the, river, but, is, one, that, remains, hotly, debated, recent, years, have, seen, an, intensification, of, grassroots, opposition, especially, in, the, state, of, assam, against, chinese, upstream, dam, building, as, well, as, growing, criticism, of, the, indian, government, for, its, perceived, failure, to, respond, appropriately, to, chinese, hydropower, plans, in, a, meeting, of, scientists, at, dhaka, at, 2010, 25, leading, experts, from, the, basin, countries, issued, a, dhaka, declaration, on, water, security, calling, for, the, exchange, of, information, in, low, flow, periods, and, other, means, of, collaboration, even, though, the, 1997, un, watercourses, convention, does, not, prevent, any, of, the, basin, countries, from, building, a, dam, upstream, customary, law, offers, some, relief, to, the, lower, riparian, countries, there, is, also, the, potential, for, china, india, and, bangladesh, to, cooperate, on, transboundary, water, navigation, the, lives, of, many, millions, of, indian, and, bangladeshi, citizens, are, reliant, on, the, brahmaputra, river, its, delta, is, home, to, 130, million, people, and, 600, 000, people, live, on, the, riverine, islands, these, people, rely, on, the, annual, normal, flood, to, bring, moisture, and, fresh, sediments, to, the, floodplain, soils, hence, providing, the, necessities, for, agricultural, and, marine, farming, in, fact, two, of, the, three, seasonal, rice, varieties, aus, and, aman, cannot, survive, without, the, floodwater, furthermore, the, fish, caught, both, on, the, floodplain, during, flood, season, and, from, the, many, floodplain, ponds, are, the, main, source, of, protein, for, many, rural, populations, brahmaputra, and, ganges, floodwaters, can, be, supplied, to, most, lands, in, india, by, constructing, a, coastal, reservoir, to, store, water, on, the, bay, of, bengal, sea, area, from, east, to, west, till, parshuram, kund, then, from, southwest, to, northeast, from, parshuram, kund, to, patum, finally, from, east, to, southwest, from, parshuram, kund, to, burhidhing, 9, new,

these, were, announced, in, 2017, by, india, s, minister, for, morth, nitin, gadkari, from, east, to, west, in, course, of, last, 64, years, since, tibet, became, part, of, china, as, an, autonomous, region, at, least, 10, bridges, have, been, built, on, brahmaputra, river, currently, as, per, satellite, imagery, only, 4, 5, bridges, built, on, river, brahmaputra, have, been, confirmed, these, are, as, follows, as, per, google, map, satellite, view, national, waterway, 2, nw2, is, 891, km, long, sadiya, dhubri, stretch, of, brahmaputra, river, in, assam
