sites, at, old, crow, flats, and, bluefish, caves, are, two, of, the, oldest, sites, of, human, habitation, in, canada, the, characteristics, of, indigenous, societies, included, permanent, settlements, agriculture, complex, societal, hierarchies, and, trading, networks, some, of, these, cultures, had, collapsed, by, the, time, european, explorers, arrived, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, and, have, only, been, discovered, through, archeological, investigations, indigenous, peoples, in, present, day, canada, include, the, first, nations, inuit, and, m, tis, the, last, being, of, mixed, descent, who, originated, in, the, mid, 17th, century, when, first, nations, people, married, european, settlers, and, subsequently, developed, their, own, identity, the,

s, royal, commission, on, aboriginal, peoples, as, a, consequence, of, european, colonization, the, indigenous, population, declined, by, forty, to, eighty, percent, the, decline, is, attributed, to, several, causes, including, the, transfer, of, european, diseases, to, which, they, had, no, natural, immunity, conflicts, over, the, fur, trade, conflicts, with, the, colonial, authorities, and, settlers, and, the, loss, of, indigenous, lands, to, settlers, and, the, subsequent, collapse, of, several, nations, self, sufficiency, although, not, without, conflict, european, canadians, early,

in, canada, particularly, for, their, role, in, assisting, european, coureurs, des, bois, and, voyageurs, in, their, explorations, of, the, continent, during, the, north, american, fur, trade, these, early, european, interactions, with, first, nations, would, change, from, friendship, and, peace, treaties, to, the, dispossession, of, indigenous, lands, through, treaties, from, the, late, 18th, century, european, canadians, forced, indigenous, peoples, to, assimilate, into, a, western, canadian, society, settler, colonialism, reached, a, climax, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, period, of, redress, began, with, the, formation, of, a, reconciliation, commission, by, the, government, of, canada, in, 2008, this, included, acknowledgment, of, cultural, genocide, settlement, agreements, and, betterment, of, racial, discrimination, issues, such, as, addressing, the, plight, of, missing, and, murdered, indigenous, women, it, is, believed, that, the, first, documented, european, to, explore, the, east, coast, of, canada, was, norse, explorer, leif, erikson, in, approximately, 1000, ad, the, norse, built, a, small, short, lived, encampment, that, was,

along, the, atlantic, coast, in, general, early, settlements, during, the, age, of, discovery, appear, to, have, been, short, lived, due, to, a, combination, of, the, harsh, climate, problems, with,
