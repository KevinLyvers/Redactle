the, great, dividing, range, also, known, as, the, east, australian, cordillera, or, the, eastern, highlands, is, a, cordillera, system, in, eastern, australia, consisting, of, an, expansive, collection, of, mountain, ranges, plateaus, and, rolling, hills, it, runs, roughly, parallel, to, the, east, coast, of, australia, and, forms, the, fifth, longest, land, based, mountain, chain, in, the, world, and, the, longest, entirely, within, a, single, country, it, is, mainland, australia, s, most, substantial, topographic, feature, and, serves, as, the, definitive, watershed, for, the, river, systems, in, eastern, australia, hence, the, name, the, great, dividing, range, stretches, more, than, 3, 500, kilometres, 2, 175, mi, from, dauan, island, in, the, torres, strait, off, the, northern, tip, of, cape, york, peninsula, running, the, entire, length, of, the, eastern, coastline, through, queensland, and, new, south, wales, then, turning, west, across, victoria, before, finally, fading, into, the, wimmera, plains, as, rolling, hills, west, of, the, grampians, region, the, width, of, the, range, varies, from, about, 160, km, 100, mi, to, over, 300, km, 190, mi, the, greater, blue, mountains, area, gondwana, rainforests, and, wet, tropics, of, queensland, world, heritage, areas, are, located, in, the, range, the, highest, place, in, australia, the, 2, 228, m, 7, 310, ft, mount, kosciuszko, resides, in, the, snowy, mountains, portion, of, southern, great, dividing, range, the, dividing, range, does, not, consist, of, a, single, continuous, mountain, chain, but, is, rather, a, combined, complex, cordillera, of, mountain, ranges, plateaus, hilly, upland, areas, and, escarpments, with, an, ancient, and, complex, geological, history, the, physiographic, division, name, for, the, landmass, is, called, the, east, australian, cordillera, in, some, places, the, terrain, is, relatively, flat, consisting, of, very, low, hills, typically, the, highlands, range, from, 300, to, 1, 600, metres, 980, to, 5, 250, ft, in, height, the, mountains, and, plateaus, which, consist, of, limestones, sandstone, quartzite, schists, and, dolomite, have, been, created, by, faulting, and, folding, processes, the, crests, of, the, great, dividing, range, is, defined, by, the, watershed, boundary, between, the, drainage, basins, of, river, systems, east, the, coastal, or, rainward, side, and, west, the, inland, or, leeward, side, of, it, the, higher, and, more, rugged, parts, of, the, range, do, not, necessarily, form, part, of, the, crest, of, the, range, but, may, be, branches, and, offshoots, from, it, the, term, great, dividing, range, may, refer, specifically, to, the, watershed, crest, of, the, range, or, to, the, entire, upland, complex, including, all, of, the, hills, and, mountains, between, the, east, coast, of, australia, and, the, central, plains, and, lowlands, at, some, places, it, can, be, up, to, 400, km, 249, mi, wide, notable, ranges, and, other, features, which, form, part, of, the, range, complex, have, their, own, distinctive, names, as, a, rule, of, thumb, rivers, east, southeast, of, the, dividing, range, drain, directly, eastward, into, the, south, pacific, and, the, tasman, sea, or, southward, into, the, bass, strait, rivers, west, of, the, dividing, range, drain, in, various, westerly, directions, according, to, latitudes, the, murray, darling, basin, in, southeastern, australia, darling, downs, eastern, south, west, queensland, west, central, new, south, wales, northern, victoria, and, the, murraylands, riverland, region, of, southeastern, south, australia, drain, southwestwards, into, the, great, australian, bight, via, the, coastal, lake, alexandrina, the, eastern, half, of, the, lake, eyre, basin, in, east, central, australia, the, cooper, creek, and, warburton, river, systems, in, central, western, south, west, queensland, and, eastern, far, north, of, south, australia, drain, southwestwards, into, the, endorheic, kati, thanda, lake, eyre, the, numerous, rivers, of, western, cape, york, peninsula, in, northeastern, australia, north, far, north, queensland, drain, westwards, or, northwestwards, directly, into, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, the, sharp, rise, between, the, coastal, lowlands, and, the, eastern, uplands, has, affected, australia, s, climate, mainly, due, to, orographic, precipitation, and, these, areas, of, highest, relief, have, revealed, an, impressive, gorge, country, areas, to, the, east, of, the, mountain, range, in, southern, nsw, usually, experience, a, f, hn, effect, which, is, a, dry, wind, originating, from, the, great, dividing, range, that, abruptly, raises, the, air, temperature, in, the, lee, of, that, mountain, range, and, reduces, atmospheric, moisture, this, dry, wind, which, elevates, fire, danger, in, the, warm, months, occurs, because, of, the, partial, orographic, obstruction, of, relatively, damp, low, level, air, and, the, subsiding, of, drier, upper, level, air, in, leeward, of, the, mountains, the, drier, air, is, then, heated, more, because, of, the, adiabatic, compression, as, it, comes, down, the, lee, slopes, forming, a, rain, shadow, in, the, cool, season, the, great, dividing, range, would, shield, much, of, the, southeast, i, e, sydney, central, coast, hunter, valley, illawarra, the, act, the, monaro, and, south, coast, from, south, westerly, cold, fronts, that, originate, from, the, southern, ocean, which, bring, chilling, rains, sleet, and, snow, to, the, upwind, side, of, the, ranges, such, as, on, the, western, central, tablelands, south, west, slopes, and, snowy, mountains, regions, all, which, have, relatively, wetter, winters, upwind, locations, include, crookwell, batlow, tumut, corryong, bright, beechworth, eildon, tolmie, and, those, in, west, gippsland, namely, the, latrobe, valley, and, wilsons, promontory, whereas, on, the, downwind, eastern, slopes, cooma, omeo, goulburn, bowral, bombala, nimmitabel, and, canberra, are, warmer, and, drier, relative, to, altitude, moreover, oberon, shooters, hill, and, sunny, corner, are, on, the, crest, of, the, ranges, and, thus, exposed, from, all, directions, hence, their, evenly, spread, rainfall, the, main, ski, resorts, in, new, south, wales, such, as, thredbo, village, perisher, and, charlotte, pass, lie, transitionally, between, the, leeward, and, windward, side, the, former, town, being, more, leeward, and, the, latter, more, windward, although, they, receive, substantial, precipitation, from, over, the, crest, of, the, ranges, they, lack, the, persistent, cloud, cover, which, characterises, truly, windward, locations, on, the, western, face, which, are, cabramurra, kiandra, mount, buller, falls, creek, mount, hotham, mount, buffalo, and, mount, baw, baw, the, great, dividing, range, was, formed, during, the, carboniferous, period, over, 300, million, years, ago, when, australia, collided, with, what, are, now, parts, of, south, america, and, new, zealand, the, range, has, experienced, significant, erosion, since, see, geology, of, australia, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, prior, to, british, colonisation, the, ranges, were, home, to, various, aboriginal, australian, nations, and, clans, evidence, remains, in, some, places, of, their, traditional, way, of, life, including, decorated, caves, campsites, and, trails, used, to, travel, between, the, coastal, and, inland, regions, many, descendants, of, these, nations, still, exist, today, and, some, remain, the, traditional, owners, and, custodians, of, their, lands, after, british, colonisation, in, 1788, the, ranges, were, an, obstacle, to, exploration, and, settlement, by, the, british, settlers, although, not, high, parts, of, the, highlands, were, very, rugged, crossing, the, blue, mountains, was, particularly, challenging, due, to, the, mistaken, idea, that, the, creeks, should, be, followed, rather, than, the, ridges, and, almost, impenetrable, labyrinthine, sandstone, mountains, the, blue, mountains, actually, lie, to, the, east, of, the, watershed, that, divides, the, hawkesbury, nepean, system, and, the, murray, darling, system, the, true, great, dividing, range, the, watershed, in, this, area, lies, to, the, west, of, lithgow, passing, near, the, locality, of, mt, lambie, and, village, of, capertee, there, as, in, some, other, places, in, new, south, wales, the, great, divide, is, only, a, slight, rise, in, the, surrounding, topography, knowing, that, local, aboriginal, people, had, already, established, routes, crossing, the, range, and, by, making, use, of, aboriginal, walking, trails, a, usable, ridge, top, route, was, finally, discovered, by, europeans, directly, westward, from, sydney, across, the, blue, mountains, to, bathurst, by, an, expedition, jointly, led, by, gregory, blaxland, william, lawson, and, william, charles, wentworth, towns, in, the, blue, mountains, were, later, named, after, each, of, these, men, this, was, the, start, of, the, development, of, the, agricultural, districts, of, inland, new, south, wales, a, road, was, built, to, blaxland, by, convicts, within, six, months, easier, routes, to, inland, new, south, wales, were, discovered, towards, goulburn, to, the, southwest, and, westwards, from, newcastle, subsequent, explorations, were, made, across, and, around, the, ranges, by, allan, cunningham, john, oxley, hamilton, hume, paul, edmund, strzelecki, ludwig, leichhardt, and, thomas, mitchell, these, explorers, were, mainly, concerned, with, finding, and, appropriating, good, agricultural, land, by, the, late, 1830s, the, most, fertile, rangelands, adjacent, to, the, mountain, ranges, had, been, explored, appropriated, from, the, traditional, inhabitants, and, some, settled, these, included, the, gippsland, and, riverina, regions, in, the, south, up, to, the, liverpool, plains, and, the, darling, downs, in, the, north, various, road, and, railway, routes, were, subsequently, established, through, many, parts, of, the, ranges, although, many, areas, remain, remote, to, this, day, for, example, in, eastern, victoria, there, is, only, one, major, road, crossing, the, highlands, from, north, to, south, the, great, alpine, road, parts, of, the, highlands, consisting, of, relatively, flat, and, by, australian, standards, well, watered, land, were, developed, for, agricultural, and, pastoral, uses, such, areas, include, the, atherton, tableland, and, darling, downs, in, queensland, and, the, northern, tablelands, southern, highlands, and, southern, tablelands, in, new, south, wales, other, parts, of, the, highlands, are, too, rugged, for, agriculture, and, have, been, used, for, forestry, many, parts, of, the, highlands, which, were, not, developed, are, now, included, in, national, parks, all, of, mainland, australia, s, alpine, areas, including, its, highest, mountain, mount, kosciuszko, 2, 228, metres, or, 7, 310, feet, ahd, are, part, of, this, range, called, the, main, range, the, highest, areas, in, southern, new, south, wales, and, eastern, victoria, are, known, as, the, australian, alps, the, central, core, of, the, great, dividing, range, is, dotted, with, hundreds, of, peaks, and, is, surrounded, by, many, smaller, mountain, ranges, or, spurs, canyons, valleys, and, plains, of, regional, significance, some, of, the, major, plains, include, the, high, plains, of, south, eastern, australia, the, southern, highlands, the, central, highlands, and, bogong, high, plains, of, victoria, other, tablelands, considered, part, of, the, great, dividing, range, are, the, atherton, tableland, canberra, wine, region, and, the, southern, tablelands, the, dandenong, ranges, barrington, tops, bunya, mountains, blue, mountains, liverpool, range, mcpherson, ranges, and, the, moonbi, range, are, some, of, the, smaller, spurs, and, ranges, that, make, up, the, greater, dividing, range, other, notable, ranges, and, tablelands, which, form, part, of, the, great, dividing, range, include, the, liverpool, range, mount, royal, range, and, the, monaro, district, whilst, some, of, the, peaks, of, the, highlands, reach, respectable, heights, of, a, little, over, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, the, age, of, the, range, and, its, erosion, mean, that, most, of, the, mountains, are, not, very, steep, and, virtually, all, peaks, can, be, reached, without, mountaineering, equipment, in, some, areas, such, as, the, snowy, mountains, victorian, alps, the, scenic, rim, and, the, eastern, escarpments, of, the, new, england, region, the, highlands, form, a, significant, barrier, the, eastern, escarpment, is, the, site, of, many, spectacular, waterfalls, which, were, formed, by, rivers, plunging, off, the, tablelands, in, other, areas, the, slopes, are, gentle, and, in, places, the, range, is, barely, perceptible, well, known, passes, on, the, range, include, coxs, gap, cunninghams, gap, dead, horse, gap, nowlands, gap, and, spicers, gap, major, cities, located, on, the, upland, areas, of, the, range, include, canberra, toowoomba, and, the, outer, suburbs, of, sydney, melbourne, brisbane, gold, coast, and, cairns, in, north, queensland, many, towns, and, cities, are, located, on, the, range, and, also, in, lowland, areas, and, foothills, adjacent, to, the, highlands, there, is, a, strong, natural, history, and, cultural, attachment, to, the, dividing, range, region, in, towns, and, on, many, sometimes, remote, landholdings, some, of, the, towns, cities, located, on, or, near, the, range, include, the, lower, reaches, are, used, for, forestry, an, activity, that, causes, friction, with, conservationists, the, range, is, also, the, source, of, virtually, all, of, eastern, australia, s, water, supply, both, through, runoff, caught, in, dams, and, throughout, much, of, queensland, through, the, great, artesian, basin, valleys, along, the, chain, of, mountains, have, yielded, a, water, source, for, important, reservoirs, and, water, supply, projects, such, as, the, upper, nepean, scheme, snowy, mountains, scheme, and, warragamba, dam, the, bradfield, scheme, has, been, mooted, as, a, way, to, transport, water, from, the, wet, tropics, of, queensland, in, the, coastal, northeast, of, far, north, queensland, via, a, series, of, dams, tunnels, southwest, to, inland, dryer, regions, including, a, tunnel, through, the, great, dividing, range, into, the, flinders, river, then, a, tunnel, into, the, torrens, creek, in, the, white, mountains, national, park, then, flows, south, into, thompson, river, cooper, creek, part, of, the, eyre, basin, many, other, variations, have, been, proposed, the, great, dividing, range, creates, the, drainage, basins, of, the, australian, south, east, coast, drainage, division, and, the, australian, north, east, coast, drainage, division, whose, water, flows, to, the, east, coast, and, into, the, pacific, ocean, tasman, sea, and, bass, strait, with, the, westerly, murray, darling, basin, which, flow, inland, away, from, the, coast, into, the, interior, plains, some, of, the, rivers, which, flow, west, of, the, ranges, includes, the, condamine, river, flinders, river, herbert, river, lachlan, river, macdonald, river, macintyre, river, and, namoi, river, rivers, that, flow, north, into, the, murray, darling, basin, from, victoria, include, the, goulburn, mitta, mitta, kiewa, ovens, king, loddon, and, campaspe, rivers, rivers, that, flow, east, into, the, pacific, ocean, include, the, annan, river, barron, river, brisbane, river, burdekin, river, burnett, river, clarence, river, daintree, river, fitzroy, river, hastings, river, hawkesbury, river, hunter, river, karuah, river, macleay, river, mary, river, pascoe, river, richmond, river, and, the, shoalhaven, river, those, that, flow, south, primarily, through, victoria, include, the, snowy, cann, tambo, mitchell, latrobe, thomson, yarra, werribee, hopkins, and, glenelg, rivers, at, some, high, hill, passes, the, range, provides, cool, sites, appropriate, for, vineyards, the, engineers, of, early, rail, passages, across, the, great, dividing, range, needed, to, find, low, sections, of, the, range, to, cross, as, well, as, suitable, low, gradient, paths, up, the, mountains, on, either, side, rail, passages, include, many, of, australia, s, highways, such, as, the, alpine, way, great, alpine, road, snowy, mountains, highway, hume, highway, illawarra, highway, northern, highway, melba,

thunderbolts, way, the, calder, highway, the, western, highway, and, the, murray, valley, highway, traverse, parts, of, the, range, much, of, the, range, lies, within, a, succession, of, national, parks, and, other, reserves, most, of, the, national, parks, are, listed, below, and, there, are, almost, double, that, amount, of, state, forests, in, 2009, as, part, of, the, q150, celebrations, the, great, dividing, range, was, announced, as, one, of, the, q150, icons, of, queensland, for, its, role, as, a, location
