italy, it, is, located, west, of, the, italian, peninsula, north, of, tunisia, and, 16, 45, km, south, of, the, french, island, of, corsica, it, is, one, of, the, five, italian, regions, with, some, degree, of, domestic, autonomy, being, granted, by, a, special, statute, its, official, name, autonomous, region, of, sardinia, is, bilingual, in, italian, and, sardinian, regione, autonoma, della, sardegna, regione, aut, noma, de, sardigna, it, is, divided, into, four, provinces, and, a, metropolitan, city, the, capital, of, the, region, of, sardinia, and, its, largest, city, is, cagliari, sardinia, s, indigenous, language, and, algherese, catalan, are, referred, to, by, both, the, regional, and, national, law, as, two, of, italy, s, twelve, officially, recognized, linguistic, minorities, albeit, gravely, endangered, while, the, regional, law, provides, some, measures, to, recognize, and, protect, the, aforementioned, as, well, as, the, island, s, other, minority, languages, the, corsican, influenced, sassarese, and, gallurese, and, finally, tabarchino, ligurian, owing, to, the, variety, of, sardinia, s, ecosystems, which, include, mountains, woods, plains, stretches, of, largely, uninhabited, territory, streams, rocky, coasts, and, long, sandy, beaches, sardinia, has, been, metaphorically, described, as, a, micro, continent, in, the, modern, era, many, travelers, and, writers, have, extolled, the, beauty, of, its, long, untouched, landscapes, which, retain, vestiges, of, the, nuragic, civilization, the, name, sardinia, has, pre, latin, roots, it, comes, from, the, pre, roman, ethnonym, s, a, rd, later, romanised, as, sardus, feminine, sarda, it, makes, its, first, appearance, on, the, nora, stone, where, the, word, rdn, or, ardana, testifies,

sard, and, its, people, as, well, might, have, been, named, after, a, legendary, woman, called, sard, born, in, sardis, capital, of, the, ancient, kingdom, of, lydia, there, has, also, been, speculation, that, identifies, the, ancient, nuragic, sards, with, the, sherden, one, of, the, sea, peoples, it, is, suggested, that, the, name, had, a, religious, connotation, from, its, use, also, as, the, adjective, for, the, ancient, sardinian, mythological, hero, god, sardus, pater, sardinian, father, a, common, explanation, that, the, term, means, father, of, the, sardinians, is, incorrect,

freshwater, lake, is, lago, di, baratz, a, number, of, large, shallow, salt, water, lagoons, and, pools, are, located, along, the, coastline, the, climate, of, the, island, is, variable, from, area, to, area, due, to, several, factors, including, the, extension, in, latitude, and, the, elevation, it, can, be, classified, in, two, different, macrobioclimates, mediterranean, pluviseasonal, oceanic, and, temperate, oceanic, one, macrobioclimatic, variant, submediterranean, and, four, classes, of, continentality, from, weak, semihyperoceanic, to, weak, semicontinental, eight, thermotypic, horizons, from, lower, thermomediterranean, to, upper, supratemperate, and, seven, ombrotypic, horizons, from, lower, dry, to, lower, hyperhumid, resulting, in, a, combination, of, 43, different, isobioclimates, during, the, year, there, is, a, major, concentration, of, rainfall, in, the, winter, and, autumn, some, heavy, showers, in, the, spring, and, snowfalls, in, the, highlands, the, average, temperature, is, between, 11, and, 18, c, 52, and, 64, f, with, mild, winters, and, warm, summers, on, the, coasts, 9, to, 16, c, 48, to, 61, f, in, january, 23, to, 31, c, 73, to, 88, f, in,

over, the, island, with, almost, totally, rainless, summers, and, wet, autumns, winters, and, springs, however, in, summer, the, rare, rainfalls, can, be, characterized, by, short, but, severe, thunderstorms, which, can, cause, flash, floods, the, climate, is, also, heavily, influenced, by, the, vicinity, of, the, gulf, of, genoa, barometric, low, and, the, relative, proximity, of, the, atlantic, ocean, low, pressures, in, autumn, can, generate, the, formation, of, the, so, called, medicanes, extratropical, cyclones, which, affect, the, mediterranean, basin, in, 2013, the, island, was, hit, by, several, cyclones, included, the, cyclone, cleopatra, which, dumped, 450, mm, 18, in, of, rainfall, within, an, hour, and, a, half, sardinia, being, relatively, large, and, hilly, weather, is, not, uniform, in, particular, the, east, is, drier, but, paradoxically, it, suffers, the, worst, rainstorms, in, autumn, 2009, it, rained, more, than, 200, mm, 7, 9, in, in, a, single, day, in, siniscola, and, 19, november, 2013, locations, in, sardinia, were, reported, to, have, received, more, than, 431, mm, 17, 0, in, within, two, hours, the, western, coast, has, a, higher,

the, wettest, is, the, top, of, the, gennargentu, mountain, with, almost, 1, 500, mm, 59, 1, in, per, year, the, average, for, the, entire, island, is, about, 800, mm, 31, 5, in, per, year, which, is, more, than, enough, for, the, needs, of, the, population, and, vegetation, the, mistral, from, the, northwest, is, the, dominant, wind, on, and, off, throughout, the, year, though, it, is, most, prevalent, in, winter, and, spring, it, can, blow, quite, strongly, but, it, is, usually, dry, and, cool, sardinia, has, been, inhabited, by, humans, since, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, era, around, 20, 10, 000, years, ago, the, island, s, most, notable, civilization, is, the, indigenous, nuragic, which, flourished, from, the, 18th, century, bc, to, either, 238, bc, or, the, 2nd, century, ad, in, some, parts, of, the, island, and, to, the, 6th, century, ad, in, that, part, of, the, island, known, as, barbagia, after, a, period, in, which, the, island, was, ruled, by, a, political, and, economic, alliance, between, the, nuragic, sardinians, and, the, phoenicians, parts, of, it, were, conquered, by, carthage, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, and, by, rome, in, 238, bc, the, roman, occupation, lasted, for, 700, years, beginning, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, island, was, ruled, by, the, vandals, and, the, byzantines, in, practice, the, island, was, disconnected, from, byzantium, s, territorial, influence, which, allowed, the, sardinians, to, provide, themselves, with, a, self, ruling, political, organization, the, four, kingdoms, known, as, judicates, the, italian, maritime, republics, of, pisa, and, genoa, struggled, to, impose, political, control, over, these, indigenous, kingdoms, but, it, was, the, iberian, crown, of, aragon, which, in, 1324, succeeded, in, bringing, the, island, under, its, control, consolidating, it, into, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, this, iberian, kingdom, endured, until, 1718, when, it, was, ceded, to, the, alpine, house, of, savoy, the, savoyards, would, politically, merge, their, insular, possession, with, their, domains, on, the, italian, mainland, which, during, the, period, of, italian, unification, they, would, go, on, to, expand, to, include, the, whole, italian, peninsula, their, territory, was, so, renamed, into, the, kingdom, of, italy, in, 1861, and, it, was, reconstituted, as, the, present, day, italian, republic, in, 1946, sardinia, is, one, of, the, most, geologically, ancient, bodies, of, land, in, europe, the, island, was, populated, in, various, waves, of, immigration, from, prehistory, until, recent, times, remains, from, corbeddu, cave, in, eastern, sardinia, have, been, suggested, by, some, authors, to, represent, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, presence, on, sardinia, around, 20, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, however, other, authors, contend, that, there, is, no, solid, evidence, for, the, occupation, of, the, island, until, the, early, mesolithic, around, 10, 000, years, ago, the, neolithic, began, on, sardinia, during, the, 6th, millennium, bc, resulting, from, the, migration, of, early, european, farmers, replacing, the, mesolithic, hunter, gatherer, populations, with, a, material, culture, including, the, widespread, cardium, pottery, style, in, the, mid, neolithic, period, the, ozieri, culture, probably, of, aegean, origin, flourished, on, the, island, spreading, the, hypogeum, tombs, known, as, domus, de, janas, while, the, arzachena, culture, of, gallura, built, the, first, megaliths, circular, tombs, in, the, early, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, metallurgy, of, copper, and, silver, began, to, develop, during, the, late, chalcolithic, the, so, called, beaker, culture, coming, from, various, parts, of, continental, europe, appeared, in, sardinia, these, new, people, predominantly, settled, on, the, west, coast, where, the, majority, of, the, sites, attributed, to, them, had, been, found, the, beaker, culture, was, followed, in, the, early, bronze, age, by, the, bonnanaro, culture, which, showed, both, reminiscences, of, the, beaker, and, influences, by, the, polada, culture, as, time, passed, the, different, sardinian, populations, appear, to, have, become, united, in, customs, yet, remained, politically, divided, into, various, small, tribal, groupings, at, times, banding, together, against, invading, forces, from, the, sea, and, at, others, waging, war, against, each, other, habitations, consisted, of, round, thatched, stone, huts, from, about, 1500, bc, onwards, villages, were, built, around, a, kind, of, round, tower, fortress, called, nuraghe, usually, pluralized, as, nuraghes, in, english, and, as, nuraghi, in, italian, these, towers, were, often, reinforced, and, enlarged, with, battlements, tribal, boundaries, were, guarded, by, smaller, lookout, nuraghes, erected, on, strategic, hills, commanding, a, view, of, other, territories, today, some, 7, 000, nuraghes, dot, the, sardinian, landscape, while, initially, these, nuraghes, had, a, relatively, simple, structure, with, time, they, became, extremely, complex, and, monumental, see, for, example, the, nuraghe, santu, antine, su, nuraxi, or, nuraghe, arrubiu, the, scale, complexity, and, territorial, spread, of, these, buildings, attest, to, the, level, of, wealth, accumulated, by, the, nuragic, sardinians, their, advances, in, technology, and, the, complexity, of, their, society, which, was, able, to, coordinate, large, numbers, of, people, with, different, roles, for, the, purpose, of, building, the, monumental, nuraghes, the, nuraghes, are, not, the, only, nuragic, buildings, that, stand, in, place, as, there, are, several, sacred, wells, around, sardinia, and, other, buildings, with, religious, purposes, such, as, the, giants, grave, monumental, collective, tombs, and, collections, of, religious, buildings, that, probably, served, as, destinations, for, pilgrimage, and, mass, religious, rites, e, g, su, romanzesu, near, bitti, at, the, time, sardinia, was, at, the, centre, of, several, commercial, routes, and, it, was, an, important, provider, of, raw, materials, such, as, copper, and, lead, which, were, pivotal, for, the, manufacture, of, the, time, by, controlling, the, extraction, of, these, raw, materials, and, by, trading, them, with, other, countries, the, ancient, sardinians, were, able, to, accumulate, wealth, and, reach, a, level, of, sophistication, that, is, not, only, reflected, in, the, complexity, of, its, surviving, buildings, but, also, in, its, artworks, e, g, the, votive, bronze, statuettes, found, across, sardinia, or, the, statues, of, mont, e, prama, according, to, some, scholars, the, nuragic, people, s, are, identifiable, with, the, sherden, a, tribe, of, the, sea, peoples, the, nuragic, civilization, was, linked, with, other, contemporaneous, megalithic, civilization, of, the, western, mediterranean, such, as, the, talaiotic, culture, of, the, balearic, islands, and, the, torrean, civilization, of, southern, corsica, evidence, of, trade, with, the, other, civilizations, of, the, time, is, attested, by, several, artefacts, e, g, pots, coming, from, as, far, as, cyprus, crete, mainland, greece, spain, and, italy, that, have, been, found, in, nuragic, sites, bearing, witness, to, the, scope, of, commercial, relations, between, the, nuragic, people, and, other, peoples, in, europe, and, beyond, around, the, 9th, century, bc, the, phoenicians, began, visiting, sardinia, with, increasing, frequency, presumably, initially, needing, safe, overnight, and, all, weather, anchorages, along, their, trade, routes, from, the, coast, of, modern, day, lebanon, as, far, afield, as, the, african, and, european, atlantic, coasts, and, beyond, the, most, common, ports, of, call, were, caralis, nora, bithia, sulci, and, tharros, claudian, a, 4th, century, latin, poet, in, his, poem, de, bello, gildonico, stated, that, caralis, was, founded, by, people, from, tyre, probably, in, the, same, time, of, the, foundation, of, carthage, in, the, 9th, or, 8th, century, bc, in, the, 6th, century, bc, after, the, conquest, of, western, sicily, the, carthaginians, planned, to, annex, sardinia, a, first, invasion, attempt, led, by, malchus, was, foiled, by, the, victorious, nuraghic, resistance, however, from, 510, bc, the, southern, and, west, central, part, of, the, island, were, invaded, a, second, time, and, came, under, carthaginian, rule, in, 238, bc, taking, advantage, of, carthage, having, to, face, a, rebellion, of, her, mercenaries, the, mercenary, war, after, the, first, punic, war, 264, 241, bc, the, romans, annexed, corsica, and, sardinia, from, the, carthaginians, the, two, islands, became, the, province, of, corsica, and, sardinia, they, were, not, given, a, provincial, governor, until, 227, bc, the, romans, faced, many, rebellions, and, it, took, them, many, years, to, pacify, both, islands, the, existing, coastal, cities, were, enlarged, and, embellished, and, roman, colonies, such, as, turris, lybissonis, and, feronia, were, founded, these, were, populated, by, roman, immigrants, the, roman, military, occupation, brought, the, nuragic, civilization, to, an, end, except, for, the, mountainous, interior, of, the, island, which, the, romans, called, barbaria, meaning, barbarian, land, roman, rule, in, sardinia, lasted, 694, years, during, which, time, the, province, was, an, important, source, of, grain, for, the, capital, latin, came, to, be, the, dominant, spoken, language, during, this, period, though, roman, culture, was, slower, to, take, hold, and, roman, rule, was, often, contested, by, the, sardinian, tribes, from, the, mountainous, regions, the, east, germanic, tribe, of, the, vandals, conquered, sardinia, in, 456, their, rule, lasted, for, 78, years, up, to, 534, when, 400, eastern, roman, troops, led, by, cyril, one, of, the, officers, of, the, foederati, retook, the, island, it, is, known, that, the, vandal, government, continued, the, forms, of, the, existing, roman, imperial, structure, the, governor, of, sardinia, continued, to, be, called, the, praeses, and, apparently, continued, to, manage, military, judicial, and, civil, governmental, functions, via, imperial, procedures, the, only, vandal, governor, of, sardinia, about, whom, there, is, substantial, record, is, the, last, godas, a, visigoth, noble, in, ad, 530, a, coup, d, tat, in, carthage, removed, king, hilderic, a, convert, to, nicene, christianity, in, favor, of, his, cousin, gelimer, an, arian, christian, like, most, of, the, elite, in, his, kingdom, godas, was, sent, to, take, charge, and, ensure, the, loyalty, of, sardinia, he, did, the, exact, opposite, declaring, the, island, s, independence, from, carthage, and, opening, negotiations, with, emperor, justinian, i, who, had, declared, war, on, hilderic, s, behalf, in, ad, 533, gelimer, sent, the, bulk, of, his, army, and, navy, 120, vessels, and, 5, 000, men, to, sardinia, to, subdue, godas, with, the, catastrophic, result, that, the, vandal, kingdom, was, overwhelmed, when, justinian, s, own, army, under, belisarius, arrived, at, carthage, in, their, absence, the, vandal, kingdom, ended, and, sardinia, was, returned, to, roman, rule, in, 533, sardinia, returned, to, the, rule, of, the, byzantine, empire, when, the, vandals, were, defeated, by, the, armies, of, justinian, i, under, the, general, belisarius, in, the, battle, of, tricamarum, in, their, african, kingdom, belisarius, sent, his, general, cyril, to, sardinia, to, retake, the, island, sardinia, remained, in, byzantine, hands, for, the, next, 300, years, aside, from, a, short, period, in, which, it, was, invaded, by, the, ostrogoths, in, 551, under, byzantine, rule, the, island, was, divided, into, districts, called, mere, ai, in, byzantine, greek, which, were, governed, by, a, judge, residing, in, caralis, and, garrisoned, by, an, army, stationed, in, forum, traiani, today, fordongianus, under, the, command, of, a, dux, during, this, time, christianity, took, deeper, root, on, the, island, supplanting, the, paganism, which, had, survived, into, the, early, middle, ages, in, the, culturally, conservative, hinterlands, along, with, lay, christianity, the, followers, of, monastic, figures, such, as, basil, of, caesarea, became, established, in, sardinia, while, christianity, penetrated, the, majority, of, the, population, the, region, of, barbagia, remained, largely, pagan, and, probably, partially, non, latin, speaking, they, re, established, a, short, lived, independent, domain, with, sardinian, heathen, lay, and, religious, traditions, one, of, its, kings, being, hospito, pope, gregory, i,

through, c, 650, after, which, local, legates, were, empowered, in, the, face, of, the, rebellion, of, gregory, the, patrician, exarch, of, africa, and, the, first, invasion, of, the, muslim,

the, arabs, in, 697, the, loss, of, imperial, control, in, africa, led, to, escalating, raids, by, arabs, on, the, island, the, first, of, which, is, documented, in, 703, forcing, increased, military,

zedda, argues, that, the, island, hosted, a, muslim, presence, during, the, aghlabid, period, possibly, a, limited, foothold, along, the, coasts, that, forcibly, coexisted, with, the, local, byzantine, government, historian, alex, metcalfe, argues, that, the, available, evidence, for, any, muslim, occupation, or, colonisation, of, the, island, during, this, period, is, limited, and,

imperial, province, suggesting, they, considered, it, lost, in, all, likelihood, a, local, noble, family, the, lacon, gunale, acceded, to, the, power, of, archon, still, identifying, themselves, as, vassals, of, the, byzantines, but, de, facto, independent, as, communications, with, constantinople, were, very, difficult, only, two, names, of, those, rulers, are, known, salusios, and, the, protospatharios, turcoturios, t, from, two, inscriptions, who, probably, reigned, between, the, 10th, and, the, 11th, century, these, rulers, were, still, closely, linked, to, the, byzantines, both, for, a, pact, of, ancient, vassalage, and, from, the, ideological, point, of, view, with, the, use, of, the, byzantine, greek, language, in, a, romance, country, and, the, use, of, art, of, byzantine, inspiration, in, the, early, 11th, century, an, attempt, to, conquer, the, island, was, made, by, the, moors, based, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, only, records, of, that, war, are, from, pisan, and, genoese, chronicles, the, christians, won, but, after, that, the, previous, sardinian, kingdom, was, undermined, and, subsequently, divided, into, four, smaller, states, cagliari, calari, arborea, arbaree, gallura, and, torres, or, logudoro, whether, this, final, transformation, from, imperial, civil, servant, to, independent, sovereign, bodies, resulted, from, imperial, abandonment, or, local, assertion, by, the, 10th, century, the, so, called, judges, sardinian, judikes, latin, iudices, a, byzantine, administrative, title, had, emerged, as, the, autonomous, rulers, of, sardinia, the, title, of, iudice, changed, with, the, language, and, local, understanding, of, the, position, becoming, the, sardinian, judike, essentially, a, king, or, sovereign, while, judicate, sardinian, logu, came, to, mean, state, early, medieval, sardinian, political, institutions, evolved, from, the, millennium, old, roman, imperial, structures, with, relatively, little, germanic, influence, although, the, judicates, were, hereditary, lordships, the, old, byzantine, imperial, notion, that, personal, title, or, honor, was, separate, from, the, state, still, remained, so, the, judicate, was, not, regarded, as, the, personal, property, of, the, monarch, as, was, common, in, later, european, feudalism, like, the, imperial, systems, the, new, order, also, preserved, semi, democratic, forms, with, national, assemblies, called, the, crown, of, the, realm, each, judicate, saw, to, its, own, defense, maintained, its, own, laws, and, administration, and, looked, after, its, own, foreign, and, trading, affairs, the, history, of, the, four, judicates, would, be, defined, by, the, contest, for, influence, between, the, two, italian, maritime, powers, of, genoa, and, pisa, and, later, the, ambitions, of, the, kingdom, of, aragon, the, judicate, of, cagliari, or, pluminos, during, the, regency, of, torchitorio, v, of, cagliari, and, his, successor, william, iii, was, allied, with, the, republic, of, genoa, because, of, this, it, was, brought, to, an, end, in, 1258, when, its, capital, santa, igia, was, stormed, and, destroyed, by, an, alliance, of, sardinian, and, pisan, forces, the, territory, then, was, divided, between, the, republic, of, pisa, the, della, gherardesca, family, from, italy, and, the, sardinian, judicates, of, arborea, and, gallura, pisa, maintained, the, control, over, the, fortress, of, castel, di, cagliari, founded, by, pisan, merchants, in, 1216, 1217, east, of, santa, igia, in, the, south, west, the, count, ugolino, della, gherardesca, promoted, the, birth, of, the, town, of, villa, di, chiesa, today, iglesias, to, exploit, the, nearby, rich, silver, deposits, the, judicate, of, logudoro, also, called, torres, was, also, allied, to, the, republic, of, genoa, and, came, to, an, end, in, 1259, after, the, death, of, the, judikessa, queen, adelasia, the, territory, was, divided, up, between, the, doria, and, malaspina, families, of, genoa, and, the, bas, serra, family, of, arborea, while, the, city, of, sassari, became, a, small, republic, along, the, lines, of, the, italian, city, states, comuni, confederated, firstly, with, pisa, and, then, with, genoa, the, judicate, of, gallura, ended, in, the, year, 1288, when, the, last, giudice, nino, visconti, a, friend, of, dante, alighieri, was, driven, out, by, the, pisans, who, occupied, the, territory, the, judicate, of, arborea, having, oristano, as, its, capital, had, the, longest, life, compared, to, the, other, kingdoms, its, later, history, is, entwined, with, the, attempt, to, unify, the, island, into, a, single, sardinian, state, republica, sardisca, sardinian, republic, in, sardinian, naci, sarda, or, sardesca, sardinian, nation, in, catalan, against, their, relatives, and, former, aragonese, allies, in, 1297, pope, boniface, viii, established, on, his, own, initiative, motu, proprio, a, hypothetical, regnum, sardiniae, et, corsicae, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, corsica, in, order, to, settle, the, war, of, the, sicilian, vespers, diplomatically, this, had, broken, out, in, 1282, between, the, capetian, house, of, anjou, and, aragon, over, the, possession, of, sicily, despite, the, existence, of, the, indigenous, states, the, pope, offered, this, newly, created, crown, to, james, ii, of, aragon, promising, him, support, should, he, wish, to, conquer, pisan, sardinia, in, exchange, for, sicily, in, 1324, in, alliance, with, the, kingdom, of, arborea, and, following, a, military, campaign, that, lasted, a, year, or, so, the, aragon, crown, prince, alfonso, led, an, aragonese, army, that, occupied, the, pisan, territories, of, cagliari, and, gallura, along, with, the, allied, city, of, sassari, naming, them, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, corsica, the, kingdom, was, to, remain, a, dominion, of, the, crown, of, aragon, under, the, 16th, century, kings, of, spain, until, the, peace, of, utrecht, during, this, period, the, judicate, of, arborea, promulgated, the, legal, code, of, the, kingdom, in, the, carta, de, logu, charter, of, the, land, the, carta, de, logu, was, originally, compiled, by, marianus, iv, of, arborea, and, was, amended, and, updated, by, mariano, s, daughter, female, judge, judikessa, or, juighissa, eleanor, of, arborea, the, legal, code, was, written, in, sardinian, and, established, a, whole, range, of, citizens, rights, among, the, revolutionary, concepts, in, this, carta, de, logu, was, the, right, of, women, to, refuse, marriage, and, to, own, property, in, terms, of, civil, liberties, the, code, made, provincial, 14th, century, sardinia, one, of, the, most, developed, societies, in, all, of, europe, in, 1353, peter, iv, of, aragon, following, aragonese, customs, granted, a, parliament, to, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, corsica, which, was, followed, by, some, degree, of, self, government, under, a, viceroy, and, judicial, independence, this, parliament, however, had, limited, powers, it, consisted, of, high, ranking, military, commanders, the, clergy, and, the, nobility, the, kingdom, of, aragon, also, introduced, the, feudal, system, into, the, areas, of, sardinia, that, it, ruled, the, sardinian, judicates, never, adopted, feudalism, and, arborea, maintained, its, parliament, called, the, corona, de, logu, crown, of, the, realm, in, this, parliament, apart, from, the, nobles, and, military, commanders, also, sat, the, representatives, of, each, township, and, village, the, corona, de, logu, exercised, some, control, over, the, king, under, the, rule, of, the, bannus, consensus, the, king, could, be, deposed, or, even, executed, if, he, did, not, follow, the, rules, of, the, kingdom, having, broken, the, alliance, with, the, crown, of, aragon, from, 1353, to, 1409, the, arborean, giudici, marianus, iv, hugh, iii, and, brancaleone, doria, husband, of, eleanor, of, arborea, succeeded, in, occupying, all, of, sardinia, except, the, heavily, fortified, towns, of, the, castle, of, cagliari, and, alghero, which, for, years, remained, as, the, only, aragonese, dominions, in, sardinia, sardinian, aragonese, war, in, 1409, martin, i, of, sicily, king, of, sicily, and, heir, to, the, crown, of, aragon, defeated, the, sardinians, at, the, battle, of, sanluri, the, battle, was, fought, by, about, 20, 000, sardinian, genoese, and, french, knights, enrolled, from, their, kingdom, at, a, time, when, the, population, of, sardinia, had, been, greatly, depleted, by, the, plague, despite, the, sardinian, army, outnumbering, the, aragonese, army, they, were, defeated, the, judicate, of, arborea, disappeared, in, 1420, when, its, rights, were, sold, by, the, last, king, for, 100, 000, gold, florins, and, after, some, of, its, most, notable, men, switched, sides, in, exchange, for, privileges, for, example, leonardo, cubello, with, some, claim, to, the, crown, being, from, a, family, related, to, the, kings, of, arborea, was, granted, the, title, of, marquis, of, oristano, and, feudal, rights, on, a, territory, that, partly, overlapped, with, the, original, extension, of, the, kingdom, of, arborea, in, exchange, for, his, subjection, to, the, aragonese, monarchs, the, conquest, of, sardinia, by, the, kingdom, of, aragon, meant, the, introduction, of, the, feudal, system, throughout, sardinia, thus, sardinia, is, probably, the, only, european, country, where, feudalism, was, introduced, in, the, transition, period, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, early, modern, period, at, a, time, when, feudalism, had, already, been, abandoned, by, many, other, european, countries, in, 1469, the, heir, to, sardinia, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, married, isabel, of, castile, and, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, which, was, separated, from, corsica, was, to, be, inherited, by, their, habsburg, grandson, charles, i, of, spain, with, the, state, symbol, of, the, four, moors, the, successors, of, charles, i, of, spain, in, order, to, defend, their, mediterranean, territories, from, raids, of, the, barbary, pirates, fortified, the, sardinian, shores, with, a, system, of, coastal, lookout, towers, allowing, the, gradual, resettlement, of, some, coastal, areas, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, remained, aragonese, spanish, for, about, 400, years, from, 1323, to, 1708, assimilating, a, number, of, spanish, traditions, customs, and, linguistic, expressions, nowadays, vividly, portrayed, in, the, folklore, parades, of, saint, efisio, in, cagliari, 1, may, the, cavalcade, on, sassari, last, but, one, sunday, in, may,

according, to, stephen, l, dyson, and, robert, j, rowland, the, jesuits, of, cagliari, recorded, years, during, the, late, 16th, century, of, such, hunger, and, so, sterile, that, the, majority, of, the, people, could, sustain, life, only, with, wild, ferns, and, other, weeds, during, the, terrible, famine, of, 1680, some, 80, 000, people, out, of, a, total, population, of, 250, 000, are, said, to, have, died, and, entire, villages, were, devastated, in, 1708, as, a, consequence, of, the, spanish, war, of, succession, the, rule, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, passed, from, king, philip, v, of, spain, into, the, hands, of, the, austrians, who, occupied, the, island, the, treaty, of, utrecht, granted, sardinia, to, the, austrians, but, in, 1717, cardinal, giulio, alberoni, minister, of, philip, v, of, spain, reoccupied, sardinia, in, 1718, with, the, treaty, of, london, sardinia, was, eventually, handed, over, to, the, house, of, savoy, this, alpine, dynasty, would, go, on, to, introduce, the, italian, language, on, the, island, forty, years, later, in, 1760, thereby, starting, a, process, of, italianization, amongst, the, islanders, in, 1793, sardinians, repelled, the, french, exp, dition, de, sardaigne, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, on, 23, february, 1793, domenico, millelire, commanding, the, sardinian, fleet, defeated, the, fleets, of, the, french, republic, near, the, maddalena, archipelago, of, which, then, lieutenant, napoleon, bonaparte, was, a, leader, millelire, became, the, first, recipient, of, the, gold, medal, of, military, valor, of, the, italian, armed, forces, in, the, same, month, sardinians, stopped, the, attempted, french, landing, on, the, beach, of, quartu, sant, elena, near, the, capital, of, cagliari, because, of, these, successes, the, representatives, of, the, nobility, and, clergy, stamenti, formulated, five, requests, addressed, to, the, king, victor, amadeus, iii, of, sardinia, but, they, were, all, met, with, rejection, because, of, this, discontent, on, 28, april, 1794, during, an, uprising, in, cagliari, two, savoyard, officials, were, killed, that, was, the, spark, that, ignited, a, revolt, called, the, sardinian, vespers, throughout, the, island, which, started, on, 28, april, 1794, commemorated, today, as, sa, die, de, sa, sardigna, with, the, expulsion, and, execution, of, the, piedmontese, officers, for, a, few, days, from, the, capital, cagliari, on, 28, december, 1795, sassari, insurgents, demonstrating, against, feudalism, mainly, from, the, region, of, logudoro, occupied, the, city, on, 13, february, 1796, in, order, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, revolt, the, viceroy, filippo, vivalda, gave, the, sardinian, magistrate, giovanni, maria, angioy, the, role, of, alternos, which, meant, a, substitute, of, the, viceroy, himself, angioy, moved, from, cagliari, to, sassari, and, during, his, journey, almost, all, the, villages, joined, the, uprising, demanding, an, end, to, feudalism, and, aiming, to, declare, the, island, to, be, an, independent, republic, but, once, he, was, outnumbered, by, loyalist, forces, he, fled, to, paris, and, sought, support, for, a, french, annexation, of, the, island, in, 1798, the, islet, near, sardinia, was, attacked, by, the, tunisians, and, over, 900, inhabitants, were, taken, away, as, slaves, the, final, muslim, attack, on, the, island, was, on, sant, antioco, on, 16, october, 1815, over, a, millennium, since, the, first, in, 1799, as, a, consequence, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, italy, the, savoy, royal, family, left, turin, and, took, refuge, in, cagliari, for, some, fifteen, years, in, 1847, the, sardinian, parliaments, stamenti, in, order, to, get, the, piedmontese, liberal, reforms, they, could, not, afford, due, to, their, separated, legal, system, renounced, their, state, autonomy, and, agreed, to, form, a, union, with, the, italian, mainland, states, stati, di, terraferma, ending, up, with, a, single, parliament, a, single, magistracy, and, a, single, government, in, turin, this, move, aggravated, the, island, s, peripheral, condition, and, most, of, the, pro, union, supporters, including, its, leader, giovanni, siotto, pintor, would, later, regret, it, in, 1820, the, savoyards, imposed, the, enclosures, act, editto, delle, chiudende, on, the, island, aimed, at, turning, the, land, s, traditional, collective, ownership, a, cultural, and, economic, cornerstone, of, sardinia, since, the, nuragic, times, to, private, property, this, gave, rise, to, many, abuses, as, the, reform, ended, up, favouring, the, landholders, while, excluding, the, poor, sardinian, farmers, and, shepherds, who, witnessed, the, abolition, of, the, communal, rights, and, the, sale, of, their, lands, many, local, rebellions, like, the, nuorese, su, connottu, the, already, known, in, sardinian, riot, in, 1868, all, repressed, by, the, king, s, army, resulted, in, an, attempt, to, return, to, the, past, and, reaffirm, the, right, to, use, the, once, common, land, however, the, common, lands, called, ademprivios, were, never, completely, abolished, and, they, are, still, present, in, large, number, to, this, day, 500, 000, hectares, of, common, lands, were, counted, in, 1956, of, which, 345, 000, constituted, by, woods, with, the, perfect, fusion, in, 1848, the, confederation, of, states, powered, by, the, savoyard, kings, of, sardinia, became, a, unitary, and, constitutional, state, and, moved, to, the, italian, wars, of, independence, for, the, unification, of, italy, that, were, led, for, thirteen, years, in, 1861, being, italy, united, by, a, debated, war, campaign, the, parliament, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, decided, by, law, to, change, its, name, and, the, title, of, its, king, to, kingdom, of, italy, and, king, of, italy, most, sardinian, forests, were, cut, down, at, this, time, in, order, to, provide, the, piedmontese, with, raw, materials, like, wood, used, to, make, railway, sleepers, on, the, mainland, the, primary, natural, forests, praised, by, every, traveller, visiting, sardinia, would, in, fact, be, reduced, to, one, fifth, of, their, original, number, being, little, more, than, 100, 000, hectares, at, the, end, of, the, century, from, 1850, onward, taxes, more, than, doubled, in, sardinia, which, compounded, the, already, severe, financial, hardships, facing, the, islanders, due, to, the, italo, french, tariff, war, between, 1885, and, 1897, the, sardinians, saw, their, land, being, confiscated, more, than, the, rest, of, italy, combined, as, a, result, of, tax, evasion, during, the, first, world, war, the, sardinian, soldiers, of, the, brigata, sassari, distinguished, themselves, it, was, the, first, and, only, regional, military, unit, in, italy, since, the, people, enrolled, were, only, sardinians, the, brigade, suffered, heavy, losses, and, earned, four, gold, medals, of, military, valor, sardinia, lost, more, young, people, than, any, other, italian, region, on, the, front, with, 138, casualties, per, 1000, soldiers, compared, to, the, italian, average, of, 100, casualties, during, the, fascist, period, with, the, implementation, of, the, policy, of, autarky, several, swamps, around, the, island, were, reclaimed, and, agrarian, communities, founded, the, main, communities, were, the, village, of, mussolinia, now, called, arborea, populated, by, farmers, from, veneto, and, friuli, in, the, area, of, oristano, and, fertilia, populated, at, first, by, settlers, from, the, ferrara, area, followed, after, world, war, ii, by, a, notable, number, of, istrian, italians, and, dalmatian, italians, hailing, from, territories, lost, to, yugoslavia, in, the, area, adjacent, the, city, of, alghero, within, the, region, of, nurra, also, established, during, that, time, 1938, was, the, city, of, carbonia, which, became, the, main, centre, of, coal, mining, activity, that, attracted, thousand, of, workers, from, the, rest, of, the, island, and, the, italian, mainland, the, sardinian, writer, grazia, deledda, won, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, in, 1926, during, the, second, world, war, sardinia, was, an, important, air, and, naval, base, and, was, heavily, bombed, by, the, allies, especially, the, city, of, cagliari, german, troops, left, the, island, on, 8, september, 1943, a, few, days, after, the, armistice, of, cassibile, and, retired, to, corsica, without, fighting, and, bloodshed, after, a, bilateral, agreement, between, the, general, antonio, basso, commander, of, the, armed, forces, of, sardinia, and, the, german, karl, hans, lungerhausen, general, of, the, 90th, panzergrenadier, division, in, 1946, by, popular, referendum, italy, became, a, republic, with, sardinia, being, administered, since, 1948, by, a, special, statute, of, autonomy, by, 1951, malaria, was, successfully, eliminated, by, the, erlaas, anti, malaric, regional, authority, and, the, support, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, which, facilitated, the, commencement, of, the, sardinian, tourist, boom, with, the, increase, in, tourism, coal, decreased, in, importance, but, sardinia, followed, the, italian, economic, miracle, in, the, early, 1960s, an, industrialisation, effort, was, commenced, the, so, called, piani, di, rinascita, rebirth, plans, with, the, initiation, of, major, infrastructure, projects, on, the, island, these, included, the, construction, of, new, dams, and, roads, reforestation, agricultural, zones, on, reclaimed, marshland, and, large, industrial, complexes, primarily, oil, refineries, and, related, petrochemical, operations, with, the, creation, of, petrochemical, industries, thousands, of, ex, farmers, became, industrial, workers, the, 1973, oil, crisis, caused, the, termination, of, employment, for, thousands, of, workers, employed, in, the, petrochemical, industries, which, aggravated, the, emigration, already, present, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, sardinia, faced, the, creation, of, military, bases, on, the, island, like, decimomannu, air, base, and, salto, di, quirra, the, biggest, scientific, military, base, in, europe, in, the, same, decades, even, now, around, 60, of, all, italian, and, nato, military, installations, in, italy, are, on, sardinia, whose, area, is, less, than, one, tenth, of, all, the, italian, territory, and, whose, population, is, little, more, than, the, 2, 5, furthermore, they, comprise, over, 35, 000, hectares, used, for, experimental, weapons, testing, where, 80, of, the, military, explosives, in, italy, are, used, sardinian, nationalism, and, local, protest, movements, became, stronger, in, the, 1970s, and, a, number, of, bandits, anonima, sarda, started, a, long, series, of, kidnappings, which, ended, only, in, the, 1990s, this, also, gave, rise, to, various, militant, groups, that, blended, separatist, and, communist, ideas, the, most, famous, being, barbagia, rossa, and, the, sardinian, armed, movement, which, perpetrated, several, bombings, and, terrorist, actions, between, the, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, in, the, span, of, just, two, years, 1987, 1988, 224, bombing, attacks, were, reported, in, 1983, a, prominent, activist, of, a, separatist, party, the, sardinian, action, party, partidu, sardu, partito, sardo, d, azione, was, elected, president, of, the, regional, parliament, and, in, the, 1980s, several, other, movements, calling, for, independence, from, italy, were, born, in, the, 1990s, some, of, them, became, political, parties, even, if, in, a, rather, disjointed, manner, it, was, not, until, 1999, that, the, island, s, languages, sardinian, sassarese, gallurese, algherese, and, tabarchino, were, recognised, even, if, just, formally, together, with, italian, the, 35th, g8, summit, was, planned, by, prodi, ii, cabinet, to, be, held, in, sardinia, on, the, island, of, la, maddalena, in, july, 2009, however, in, april, 2009, the, italian, prime, minister, silvio, berlusconi, decided, without, convoking, the, italian, parliament, or, consulting, the, sardinian, governor, of, his, own, party, to, move, the, summit, even, though, the, works, were, almost, completed, to, l, aquila, provoking, heavy, protests, today, sardinia, is, phasing, in, as, an, eu, region, with, a, diversified, economy, focused, on, tourism, and, the, tertiary, sector, the, economic, efforts, of, the, last, twenty, years, have, reduced, the, handicap, of, insularity, especially, in, the, fields, of, low, cost, air, travel, and, advanced, information, technology, for, example, the, crs4, center, for, advanced, studies, research, and, development, in, sardinia, developed, the, second, european, website, and, 1st, in, italy,

is, predicted, that, at, that, rate, sardinia, will, be, the, european, island, with, the, second, lowest, population, density, immediately, after, iceland, by, 2080, nonetheless, the, overall,

called, master, of, ozieri, who, was, headed, by, giovanni, del, giglio, and, pietro, giovanni, calvano, of, senese, origin, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, in, early, twentieth, century, originated, the, myths, of, an, uncontaminated, and, timeless, island, recounted, by, the, many, travelers, who, visited, sardinia, in, that, period, like, d, h, lawrence, such, myths, were, celebrated, mainly, by, sardinian, artists, such, as, giuseppe, biasi, francesco, ciusa, filippo, figari, mario, delitala, and, stanis, dessy, in, their, works, they, highlighted, the, autochthonous, values, of, the, agro, pastoral, world, not, yet, homologated, to, the, modernity, that, was, pressing, from, the, outside, other, important, sardinian, artists, of, the, second, half, of, the,

followed, by, the, island, s, indigenous, language, sardinian, sardu, sardinian, is, a, distinct, branch, of, the, romance, language, family, going, either, by, the, same, name, or, by, southern, romance, it, is, therefore, a, separate, language, rather, than, an, italian, dialect, and, it, is, also, closer, to, its, latin, roots, than, italian, itself, sardinian, has, been, formally, recognized, as, one, of, italy, s, twelve, historical, ethnolinguistic, minorities, since, 1997, by, regional, and, italian, law, the, language, has, been, influenced, by, catalan, spanish, and, recently, italian, while, the, once, spoken, paleo, sardinian, language, contributes, many, features, to, it, in, many, ancient, remnants, in, 2006, the, regional, administration, has, approved, the, use, of, a, single, standardised, writing, system, the, so, called, limba, sarda, comuna, in, official, acts, as, a, literary, language, sardinian, is, gaining, importance, despite, heated, debate, about, the, lack, of, a, commonly, acknowledged, standard, orthography, and, controversial, proposed, solutions, to, this, problem, the, two, main, orthographies, of, the, language, are, in, fact, campidanese, sardu, campidanesu, used, in, central, southern, sardinia, and, logudorese, sardu, logudoresu, extending, northwards, almost, to, the, suburbs, of, sassari, the, sardinian, language, is, quite, different, from, the, other, romance, languages, and, is, homogeneous, in, terms, of, morphology, syntax, and, lexicon, but, it, also, shows, a, spectrum, of, variation, in, terms, of, phonetics, between, the, northern, and, the, southern, dialects, sassarese, sassaresu, and, gallurese, gadduresu, are, classified, as, corso, sardinian, languages, therefore, belonging, to, the, italo, dalmatian, branch, rather, than, to, the, sardinian, one, and, are, spoken, in, the, north, in, sardinia, there, are, a, few, language, islands, the, algherese, dialect, alguer, s, of, catalan, is, spoken, in, the, city, of, alghero, on, the, islands, of, san, pietro, and, sant, antioco, located, in, the, extreme, south, west, of, sardinia, the, local, population, speaks, a, variant, of, ligurian, called, tabarchino, tabarchin, fewer, and, fewer, people, speak, venetian, friulian, and, istriot, in, arborea, and, fertilia, since, these, villages, have, been, populated, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, by, mainland, colonists, who, came, from, northeast, italy, and, families, from, istria, and, dalmatia, immediately, after, world, war, ii, due, to, the, italian, assimilation, policies, carried, out, since, the, late, 18th, century, and, the, ongoing, absorption, into, the, italian, culture, over, the, course, of, time, the, once, prevalent, indigenous, language, has, been, increasingly, losing, ground, to, italian, and, the, process, of, ongoing, language, shift, has, led, to, its, endangerment, in, fact, according, to, the, data, published, by, istat, in, 2006, 52, 5, of, the, sardinian, population, speaks, only, italian, in, the, family, environment, while, 29, 3, alternates, italian, and, sardinian, and, only, 16, 6, uses, sardinian, or, other, non, italian, languages, outside, the, circle, of, family, and, friends, the, last, option, drops, to, 5, 2, the, resulting, italianization, has, led, to, a, steep, decline, of, the, sardinian, language, as, well, as, produced, a, new, non, standard, variety, of, today, s, majority, idiom, italian, regional, italian, of, sardinia, italiano, regionale, sardo, irs, following, the, recent, growth, of, the,
