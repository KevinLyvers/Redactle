the, tropic, of, capricorn, or, the, southern, tropic, is, the, circle, of, latitude, that, contains, the, subsolar, point, at, the, december, or, southern, solstice, it, is, thus, the, southernmost, latitude, where, the, sun, can, be, seen, directly, overhead, it, also, reaches, 90, degrees, below, the, horizon, at, solar, midnight, on, the, june, solstice, its, northern, equivalent, is, the, tropic, of, cancer, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, one, of, the, five, major, circles, of, latitude, marked, on, maps, of, earth, its, latitude, is, currently, 23, 26, 09, 9, or, 23, 43608, south, of, the, equator, but, it, is, very, gradually, moving, northward, currently, at, the, rate, of, 0, 47, arcseconds, or, 15, metres, per, year, when, this, line, of, latitude, was, named, in, the, last, centuries, bc, the, sun, was, in, the, constellation, capricornus, at, the, december, solstice, this, is, the, date, each, year, when, the, sun, reaches, zenith, at, this, latitude, the, southernmost, declination, it, reaches, for, the, year, due, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, sun, currently, appears, in, sagittarius, at, this, solstice, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, the, dividing, line, between, the, southern, temperate, zone, to, the, south, and, the, tropics, to, the, north, the, northern, hemisphere, equivalent, of, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, the, tropic, of, cancer, the, tropic, of, capricorn, s, position, is, not, fixed, but, constantly, changes, because, of, a, slight, wobble, in, the, earth, s, longitudinal, alignment, relative, to, its, orbit, around, the, sun, earth, s, axial, tilt, varies, over, a, 41, 000, year, period, from, about, 22, 1, to, 24, 5, degrees, and, currently, resides, at, about, 23, 4, degrees, this, wobble, means, that, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, currently, drifting, northward, at, a, rate, of, almost, half, an, arcsecond, 0, 468, of, latitude, or, 15, metres, per, year, it, was, at, exactly, 23, 27, s, in, 1917, and, will, be, at, 23, 26, s, in, 2045, therefore, the, distance, between, arctic, circle, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, is, essentially, constant, moving, in, tandem, see, under, circles, of, latitude, for, information, there, are, approximately, 10, hours, 41, minutes, of, daylight, during, the, june, solstice, southern, hemisphere, winter, during, the, december, solstice, southern, hemisphere, summer, there, are, 13, hours, 35, minutes, of, daylight, the, length, of, the, tropic, of, capricorn, at, 23, 26, 11, 7, s, is, 36, 788, km, 22, 859, mi, in, most, of, this, belt, of, southern, africa, a, minimum, of, seasonal, rainfall, is, reliable, and, farming, is, possible, though, yields, struggle, to, compete, with, for, example, the, mississippi, basin, even, against, like, to, like, soil, fertilisers, rivers, have, been, successfully, dammed, particularly, flowing, from, relief, precipitation, areas, high, eminences, and, those, from, the, edge, of, the, great, rift, valley, such, as, the, zambezi, well, within, the, tropics, this, with, alluvial, or, enriched, soil, enables, substantial, yield, grain, farming, in, areas, with, good, soil, across, this, large, region, pasture, farming, is, widespread, where, intensive, brief, and, rotational, it, helps, to, fertilise, and, stabilise, the, soil, preventing, run, off, and, desertification, this, approach, is, traditional, to, many, tribes, and, promoted, by, government, advisors, such, as, allan, savory, a, zimbabwean, born, biologist, farmer, game, rancher, politician, and, international, consultant, and, co, founder, of, the, savory, institute, according, to, the, united, nations, university, our, world, dissemination, he, is, credited, with, developing, holistic, management, in, the, 1960s, and, has, led, anti, desertification, efforts, in, africa, for, decades, using, a, counterintuitive, approach, to, most, developed, economies, of, increasing, the, number, of, livestock, on, grasslands, rather, than, fencing, them, off, for, conservation, such, practices, in, this, area, have, seen, success, and, won, generous, awards, he, gave, the, keynote, speech, at, unccd, s, land, day, in, 2018, and, later, that, year, a, ted, conference, address, widely, re, broadcast, in, australia, areas, around, the, tropic, have, some, of, the, world, s, most, variable, rainfall, in, the, east, advanced,

geologically, young, and, evolving, andes, means, that, this, region, is, on, the, western, side, of, the, subtropical, anticyclones, and, thus, receives, warm, and, humid, air, from, the, atlantic, ocean, as, a, result, areas, in, brazil, adjacent, to, the, tropic, are, impressively, productive, agricultural, regions, producing, large, quantities, of, crops, such, as, sugarcane, and, the,

by, the, prairies, region, in, canada, west, of, the, andes, which, creates, a, rain, shadow, the, air, is, further, cooled, and, dried, by, the, cold, humboldt, current, which, makes, it, very, arid,
