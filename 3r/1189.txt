in, this, place, asunci, n, has, been, the, first, completely, urban, city, in, paraguay, since, approximately, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, on, the, other, hand, until, the, early, 1980s, asunci, n, was, the, only, city, in, paraguay, with, more, than, 100, 000, inhabitants, taking, into, account, that, the, rural, population, has, always, predominated, in, paraguay, at, the, end, of,

of, asunci, n, remained, practically, stagnant, since, then, in, march, 1991, just, two, years, after, the, coup, d, tat, against, the, government, of, alfredo, stroessner, which, lasted, almost, 35,

tragedy, of, ycua, bola, os, a, fire, that, claimed, more, than, 300, lives, with, hundreds, injured, due, to, the, unbridled, growth, and, lack, of, urban, planning, and, infrastructure, in, the,
