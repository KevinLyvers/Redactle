surveying, or, land, surveying, is, the, technique, profession, art, and, science, of, determining, the, terrestrial, two, dimensional, or, three, dimensional, positions, of, points, and, the, distances, and, angles, between, them, these, points, are, usually, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, they, are, often, used, to, establish, maps, and, boundaries, for, ownership, locations, such, as, the, designated, positions, of, structural, components, for, construction, or, the, surface, location, of, subsurface, features, or, other, purposes, required, by, government, or, civil, law, such, as, property, sales, a, professional, in, land, surveying, is, called, a, land, surveyor, surveyors, work, with, elements, of, geodesy, geometry, trigonometry, regression, analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming, languages, and, the, law, they, use, equipment, such, as, total, stations, robotic, total, stations, theodolites, gnss, receivers, retroreflectors, 3d, scanners, lidar, sensors, radios, inclinometer, handheld, tablets, optical, and, digital, levels, subsurface, locators, drones, gis, and, surveying, software, surveying, has, been, an, element, in, the, development, of, the, human, environment, since, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, it, is, used, in, the, planning, and, execution, of, most, forms, of, construction, it, is, also, used, in, transportation, communications, mapping, and, the, definition, of, legal, boundaries, for, land, ownership, it, is, an, important, tool, for, research, in, many, other, scientific, disciplines, the, international, federation, of, surveyors, defines, the, function, of, surveying, as, follows, a, surveyor, is, a, professional, person, with, the, academic, qualifications, and, technical, expertise, to, conduct, one, or, more, of, the, following, activities, surveying, has, occurred, since, humans, built, the, first, large, structures, in, ancient, egypt, a, rope, stretcher, would, use, simple, geometry, to, re, establish, boundaries, after, the, annual, floods, of, the, nile, river, the, almost, perfect, squareness, and, north, south, orientation, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, built, c, 2700, bc, affirm, the, egyptians, command, of, surveying, the, groma, instrument, may, have, originated, in, mesopotamia, early, 1st, millennium, bc, the, prehistoric, monument, at, stonehenge, c, 2500, bc, was, set, out, by, prehistoric, surveyors, using, peg, and, rope, geometry, the, mathematician, liu, hui, described, ways, of, measuring, distant, objects, in, his, work, haidao, suanjing, or, the, sea, island, mathematical, manual, published, in, 263, ad, the, romans, recognized, land, surveying, as, a, profession, they, established, the, basic, measurements, under, which, the, roman, empire, was, divided, such, as, a, tax, register, of, conquered, lands, 300, ad, roman, surveyors, were, known, as, gromatici, in, medieval, europe, beating, the, bounds, maintained, the, boundaries, of, a, village, or, parish, this, was, the, practice, of, gathering, a, group, of, residents, and, walking, around, the, parish, or, village, to, establish, a, communal, memory, of, the, boundaries, young, boys, were, included, to, ensure, the, memory, lasted, as, long, as, possible, in, england, william, the, conqueror, commissioned, the, domesday, book, in, 1086, it, recorded, the, names, of, all, the, land, owners, the, area, of, land, they, owned, the, quality, of, the, land, and, specific, information, of, the, area, s, content, and, inhabitants, it, did, not, include, maps, showing, exact, locations, abel, foullon, described, a, plane, table, in, 1551, but, it, is, thought, that, the, instrument, was, in, use, earlier, as, his, description, is, of, a, developed, instrument, gunter, s, chain, was, introduced, in, 1620, by, english, mathematician, edmund, gunter, it, enabled, plots, of, land, to, be, accurately, surveyed, and, plotted, for, legal, and, commercial, purposes, leonard, digges, described, a, theodolite, that, measured, horizontal, angles, in, his, book, a, geometric, practice, named, pantometria, 1571, joshua, habermel, erasmus, habermehl, created, a, theodolite, with, a, compass, and, tripod, in, 1576, johnathon, sission, was, the, first, to, incorporate, a, telescope, on, a, theodolite, in, 1725, in, the, 18th, century, modern, techniques, and, instruments, for, surveying, began, to, be, used, jesse, ramsden, introduced, the, first, precision, theodolite, in, 1787, it, was, an, instrument, for, measuring, angles, in, the, horizontal, and, vertical, planes, he, created, his, great, theodolite, using, an, accurate, dividing, engine, of, his, own, design, ramsden, s, theodolite, represented, a, great, step, forward, in, the, instrument, s, accuracy, william, gascoigne, invented, an, instrument, that, used, a, telescope, with, an, installed, crosshair, as, a, target, device, in, 1640, james, watt, developed, an, optical, meter, for, the, measuring, of, distance, in, 1771, it, measured, the, parallactic, angle, from, which, the, distance, to, a, point, could, be, deduced, dutch, mathematician, willebrord, snellius, a, k, a, snel, van, royen, introduced, the, modern, systematic, use, of, triangulation, in, 1615, he, surveyed, the, distance, from, alkmaar, to, breda, approximately, 72, miles, 116, km, he, underestimated, this, distance, by, 3, 5, the, survey, was, a, chain, of, quadrangles, containing, 33, triangles, in, all, snell, showed, how, planar, formulae, could, be, corrected, to, allow, for, the, curvature, of, the, earth, he, also, showed, how, to, resect, or, calculate, the, position, of, a, point, inside, a, triangle, using, the, angles, cast, between, the, vertices, at, the, unknown, point, these, could, be, measured, more, accurately, than, bearings, of, the, vertices, which, depended, on, a, compass, his, work, established, the, idea, of, surveying, a, primary, network, of, control, points, and, locating, subsidiary, points, inside, the, primary, network, later, between, 1733, and, 1740, jacques, cassini, and, his, son, c, sar, undertook, the, first, triangulation, of, france, they, included, a, re, surveying, of, the, meridian, arc, leading, to, the, publication, in, 1745, of, the, first, map, of, france, constructed, on, rigorous, principles, by, this, time, triangulation, methods, were, well, established, for, local, map, making, it, was, only, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, that, detailed, triangulation, network, surveys, mapped, whole, countries, in, 1784, a, team, from, general, william, roy, s, ordnance, survey, of, great, britain, began, the, principal, triangulation, of, britain, the, first, ramsden, theodolite, was, built, for, this, survey, the, survey, was, finally, completed, in, 1853, the, great, trigonometric, survey, of, india, began, in, 1801, the, indian, survey, had, an, enormous, scientific, impact, it, was, responsible, for, one, of, the, first, accurate, measurements, of, a, section, of, an, arc, of, longitude, and, for, measurements, of, the, geodesic, anomaly, it, named, and, mapped, mount, everest, and, the, other, himalayan, peaks, surveying, became, a, professional, occupation, in, high, demand, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, profession, developed, more, accurate, instruments, to, aid, its, work, industrial, infrastructure, projects, used, surveyors, to, lay, out, canals, roads, and, rail, in, the, us, the, land, ordinance, of, 1785, created, the, public, land, survey, system, it, formed, the, basis, for, dividing, the, western, territories, into, sections, to, allow, the, sale, of, land, the, plss, divided, states, into, township, grids, which, were, further, divided, into, sections, and, fractions, of, sections, napoleon, bonaparte, founded, continental, europe, s, first, cadastre, in, 1808, this, gathered, data, on, the, number, of, parcels, of, land, their, value, land, usage, and, names, this, system, soon, spread, around, europe, robert, torrens, introduced, the, torrens, system, in, south, australia, in, 1858, torrens, intended, to, simplify, land, transactions, and, provide, reliable, titles, via, a, centralized, register, of, land, the, torrens, system, was, adopted, in, several, other, nations, of, the, english, speaking, world, surveying, became, increasingly, important, with, the, arrival, of, railroads, in, the, 1800s, surveying, was, necessary, so, that, railroads, could, plan, technologically, and, financially, viable, routes, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, surveyors, had, improved, the, older, chains, and, ropes, but, they, still, faced, the, problem, of, accurate, measurement, of, long, distances, trevor, lloyd, wadley, developed, the, tellurometer, during, the, 1950s, it, measures, long, distances, using, two, microwave, transmitter, receivers, during, the, late, 1950s, geodimeter, introduced, electronic, distance, measurement, edm, equipment, edm, units, use, a, multi, frequency, phase, shift, of, light, waves, to, find, a, distance, these, instruments, eliminated, the, need, for, days, or, weeks, of, chain, measurement, by, measuring, between, points, kilometers, apart, in, one, go, advances, in, electronics, allowed, miniaturization, of, edm, in, the, 1970s, the, first, instruments, combining, angle, and, distance, measurement, appeared, becoming, known, as, total, stations, manufacturers, added, more, equipment, by, degrees, bringing, improvements, in, accuracy, and, speed, of, measurement, major, advances, include, tilt, compensators, data, recorders, and, on, board, calculation, programs, the, first, satellite, positioning, system, was, the, us, navy, transit, system, the, first, successful, launch, took, place, in, 1960, the, system, s, main, purpose, was, to, provide, position, information, to, polaris, missile, submarines, surveyors, found, they, could, use, field, receivers, to, determine, the, location, of, a, point, sparse, satellite, cover, and, large, equipment, made, observations, laborious, and, inaccurate, the, main, use, was, establishing, benchmarks, in, remote, locations, the, us, air, force, launched, the, first, prototype, satellites, of, the, global, positioning, system, gps, in, 1978, gps, used, a, larger, constellation, of, satellites, and, improved, signal, transmission, thus, improving, accuracy, early, gps, observations, required, several, hours, of, observations, by, a, static, receiver, to, reach, survey, accuracy, requirements, later, improvements, to, both, satellites, and, receivers, allowed, for, real, time, kinematic, rtk, surveying, rtk, surveys, provide, high, accuracy, measurements, by, using, a, fixed, base, station, and, a, second, roving, antenna, the, position, of, the, roving, antenna, can, be, tracked, the, theodolite, total, station, and, rtk, gps, survey, remain, the, primary, methods, in, use, remote, sensing, and, satellite, imagery, continue, to, improve, and, become, cheaper, allowing, more, commonplace, use, prominent, new, technologies, include, three, dimensional, 3d, scanning, and, lidar, based, topographical, surveys, uav, technology, along, with, photogrammetric, image, processing, is, also, appearing, the, main, surveying, instruments, in, use, around, the, world, are, the, theodolite, measuring, tape, total, station, 3d, scanners, gps, gnss, level, and, rod, most, instruments, screw, onto, a, tripod, when, in, use, tape, measures, are, often, used, for, measurement, of, smaller, distances, 3d, scanners, and, various, forms, of, aerial, imagery, are, also, used, the, theodolite, is, an, instrument, for, the, measurement, of, angles, it, uses, two, separate, circles, protractors, or, alidades, to, measure, angles, in, the, horizontal, and, the, vertical, plane, a, telescope, mounted, on, trunnions, is, aligned, vertically, with, the, target, object, the, whole, upper, section, rotates, for, horizontal, alignment, the, vertical, circle, measures, the, angle, that, the, telescope, makes, against, the, vertical, known, as, the, zenith, angle, the, horizontal, circle, uses, an, upper, and, lower, plate, when, beginning, the, survey, the, surveyor, points, the, instrument, in, a, known, direction, bearing, and, clamps, the, lower, plate, in, place, the, instrument, can, then, rotate, to, measure, the, bearing, to, other, objects, if, no, bearing, is, known, or, direct, angle, measurement, is, wanted, the, instrument, can, be, set, to, zero, during, the, initial, sight, it, will, then, read, the, angle, between, the, initial, object, the, theodolite, itself, and, the, item, that, the, telescope, aligns, with, the, gyrotheodolite, is, a, form, of, theodolite, that, uses, a, gyroscope, to, orient, itself, in, the, absence, of, reference, marks, it, is, used, in, underground, applications, the, total, station, is, a, development, of, the, theodolite, with, an, electronic, distance, measurement, device, edm, a, total, station, can, be, used, for, leveling, when, set, to, the, horizontal, plane, since, their, introduction, total, stations, have, shifted, from, optical, mechanical, to, fully, electronic, devices, modern, top, of, the, line, total, stations, no, longer, need, a, reflector, or, prism, to, return, the, light, pulses, used, for, distance, measurements, they, are, fully, robotic, and, can, even, e, mail, point, data, to, a, remote, computer, and, connect, to, satellite, positioning, systems, such, as, global, positioning, system, real, time, kinematic, gps, systems, have, significantly, increased, the, speed, of, surveying, and, they, are, now, horizontally, accurate, to, within, 1, cm, 1, ppm, in, real, time, while, vertically, it, is, currently, about, half, of, that, to, within, 2, cm, 2, ppm, gps, surveying, differs, from, other, gps, uses, in, the, equipment, and, methods, used, static, gps, uses, two, receivers, placed, in, position, for, a, considerable, length, of, time, the, long, span, of, time, lets, the, receiver, compare, measurements, as, the, satellites, orbit, the, changes, as, the, satellites, orbit, also, provide, the, measurement, network, with, well, conditioned, geometry, this, produces, an, accurate, baseline, that, can, be, over, 20, km, long, rtk, surveying, uses, one, static, antenna, and, one, roving, antenna, the, static, antenna, tracks, changes, in, the, satellite, positions, and, atmospheric, conditions, the, surveyor, uses, the, roving, antenna, to, measure, the, points, needed, for, the, survey, the, two, antennas, use, a, radio, link, that, allows, the, static, antenna, to, send, corrections, to, the, roving, antenna, the, roving, antenna, then, applies, those, corrections, to, the, gps, signals, it, is, receiving, to, calculate, its, own, position, rtk, surveying, covers, smaller, distances, than, static, methods, this, is, because, divergent, conditions, further, away, from, the, base, reduce, accuracy, surveying, instruments, have, characteristics, that, make, them, suitable, for, certain, uses, theodolites, and, levels, are, often, used, by, constructors, rather, than, surveyors, in, first, world, countries, the, constructor, can, perform, simple, survey, tasks, using, a, relatively, cheap, instrument, total, stations, are, workhorses, for, many, professional, surveyors, because, they, are, versatile, and, reliable, in, all, conditions, the, productivity, improvements, from, a, gps, on, large, scale, surveys, makes, them, popular, for, major, infrastructure, or, data, gathering, projects, one, person, robotic, guided, total, stations, allow, surveyors, to, measure, without, extra, workers, to, aim, the, telescope, or, record, data, a, fast, but, expensive, way, to, measure, large, areas, is, with, a, helicopter, using, a, gps, to, record, the, location, of, the, helicopter, and, a, laser, scanner, to, measure, the, ground, to, increase, precision, surveyors, place, beacons, on, the, ground, about, 20, km, 12, mi, apart, this, method, reaches, precisions, between, 5, 40, cm, depending, on, flight, height, surveyors, use, ancillary, equipment, such, as, tripods, and, instrument, stands, staves, and, beacons, used, for, sighting, purposes, ppe, vegetation, clearing, equipment, digging, implements, for, finding, survey, markers, buried, over, time, hammers, for, placements, of, markers, in, various, surfaces, and, structures, and, portable, radios, for, communication, over, long, lines, of, sight, land, surveyors, construction, professionals, geomatics, engineers, and, civil, engineers, using, total, station, gps, 3d, scanners, and, other, collector, data, use, land, surveying, software, to, increase, efficiency, accuracy, and, productivity, land, surveying, software, is, a, staple, of, contemporary, land, surveying, typically, much, if, not, all, of, the, drafting, and, some, of, the, designing, for, plans, and, plats, of, the, surveyed, property, is, done, by, the, surveyor, and, nearly, everyone, working, in, the, area, of, drafting, today, 2021, utilizes, cad, software, and, hardware, both, on, pc, and, more, and, more, in, newer, generation, data, collectors, in, the, field, as, well, other, computer, platforms, and, tools, commonly, used, today, by, surveyors, are, offered, online, by, the, u, s, federal, government, and, other, governments, survey, agencies, such, as, the, national, geodetic, survey, and, the, cors, network, to, get, automated, corrections, and, conversions, for, collected, gps, data, and, the, data, coordinate, systems, themselves, surveyors, determine, the, position, of, objects, by, measuring, angles, and, distances, the, factors, that, can, affect, the, accuracy, of, their, observations, are, also, measured, they, then, use, this, data, to, create, vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans, and, maps, measurements, are, often, split, into, horizontal, and, vertical, components, to, simplify, calculation, gps, and, astronomic, measurements, also, need, measurement, of, a, time, component, before, edm, electronic, distance, measurement, laser, devices, distances, were, measured, using, a, variety, of, means, in, pre, colonial, america, natives, would, use, the, bow, shot, as, a, distance, reference, as, far, as, an, arrow, can, slung, out, of, a, bow, or, flights, of, a, cherokee, long, bow, europeans, used, chains, with, links, of, a, known, length, such, as, a, gunter, s, chain, or, measuring, tapes, made, of, steel, or, invar, to, measure, horizontal, distances, these, chains, or, tapes, were, pulled, taut, to, reduce, sagging, and, slack, the, distance, had, to, be, adjusted, for, heat, expansion, attempts, to, hold, the, measuring, instrument, level, would, also, be, made, when, measuring, up, a, slope, the, surveyor, might, have, to, break, break, chain, the, measurement, use, an, increment, less, than, the, total, length, of, the, chain, perambulators, or, measuring, wheels, were, used, to, measure, longer, distances, but, not, to, a, high, level, of, accuracy, tacheometry, is, the, science, of, measuring, distances, by, measuring, the, angle, between, two, ends, of, an, object, with, a, known, size, it, was, sometimes, used, before, to, the, invention, of, edm, where, rough, ground, made, chain, measurement, impractical, historically, horizontal, angles, were, measured, by, using, a, compass, to, provide, a, magnetic, bearing, or, azimuth, later, more, precise, scribed, discs, improved, angular, resolution, mounting, telescopes, with, reticles, atop, the, disc, allowed, more, precise, sighting, see, theodolite, levels, and, calibrated, circles, allowed, the, measurement, of, vertical, angles, verniers, allowed, measurement, to, a, fraction, of, a, degree, such, as, with, a, turn, of, the, century, transit, the, plane, table, provided, a, graphical, method, of, recording, and, measuring, angles, which, reduced, the, amount, of, mathematics, required, in, 1829, francis, ronalds, invented, a, reflecting, instrument, for, recording, angles, graphically, by, modifying, the, octant, by, observing, the, bearing, from, every, vertex, in, a, figure, a, surveyor, can, measure, around, the, figure, the, final, observation, will, be, between, the, two, points, first, observed, except, with, a, 180, difference, this, is, called, a, close, if, the, first, and, last, bearings, are, different, this, shows, the, error, in, the, survey, called, the, angular, misclose, the, surveyor, can, use, this, information, to, prove, that, the, work, meets, the, expected, standards, the, simplest, method, for, measuring, height, is, with, an, altimeter, using, air, pressure, to, find, the, height, when, more, precise, measurements, are, needed, means, like, precise, levels, also, known, as, differential, leveling, are, used, when, precise, leveling, a, series, of, measurements, between, two, points, are, taken, using, an, instrument, and, a, measuring, rod, differences, in, height, between, the, measurements, are, added, and, subtracted, in, a, series, to, get, the, net, difference, in, elevation, between, the, two, endpoints, with, the, global, positioning, system, gps, elevation, can, be, measured, with, satellite, receivers, usually, gps, is, somewhat, less, accurate, than, traditional, precise, leveling, but, may, be, similar, over, long, distances, when, using, an, optical, level, the, endpoint, may, be, out, of, the, effective, range, of, the, instrument, there, may, be, obstructions, or, large, changes, of, elevation, between, the, endpoints, in, these, situations, extra, setups, are, needed, turning, is, a, term, used, when, referring, to, moving, the, level, to, take, an, elevation, shot, from, a, different, location, to, turn, the, level, one, must, first, take, a, reading, and, record, the, elevation, of, the, point, the, rod, is, located, on, while, the, rod, is, being, kept, in, exactly, the, same, location, the, level, is, moved, to, a, new, location, where, the, rod, is, still, visible, a, reading, is, taken, from, the, new, location, of, the, level, and, the, height, difference, is, used, to, find, the, new, elevation, of, the, level, gun, which, is, why, this, method, is, referred, to, as, differential, levelling, this, is, repeated, until, the, series, of, measurements, is, completed, the, level, must, be, horizontal, to, get, a, valid, measurement, because, of, this, if, the, horizontal, crosshair, of, the, instrument, is, lower, than, the, base, of, the, rod, the, surveyor, will, not, be, able, to, sight, the, rod, and, get, a, reading, the, rod, can, usually, be, raised, up, to, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, high, allowing, the, level, to, be, set, much, higher, than, the, base, of, the, rod, the, primary, way, of, determining, one, s, position, on, the, earth, s, surface, when, no, known, positions, are, nearby, is, by, astronomic, observations, observations, to, the, sun, moon, and, stars, could, all, be, made, using, navigational, techniques, once, the, instrument, s, position, and, bearing, to, a, star, is, determined, the, bearing, can, be, transferred, to, a, reference, point, on, earth, the, point, can, then, be, used, as, a, base, for, further, observations, survey, accurate, astronomic, positions, were, difficult, to, observe, and, calculate, and, so, tended, to, be, a, base, off, which, many, other, measurements, were, made, since, the, advent, of, the, gps, system, astronomic, observations, are, rare, as, gps, allows, adequate, positions, to, be, determined, over, most, of, the, surface, of, the, earth, few, survey, positions, are, derived, from, the, first, principles, instead, most, surveys, points, are, measured, relative, to, previously, measured, points, this, forms, a, reference, or, control, network, where, each, point, can, be, used, by, a, surveyor, to, determine, their, own, position, when, beginning, a, new, survey, survey, points, are, usually, marked, on, the, earth, s, surface, by, objects, ranging, from, small, nails, driven, into, the, ground, to, large, beacons, that, can, be, seen, from, long, distances, the, surveyors, can, set, up, their, instruments, in, this, position, and, measure, to, nearby, objects, sometimes, a, tall, distinctive, feature, such, as, a, steeple, or, radio, aerial, has, its, position, calculated, as, a, reference, point, that, angles, can, be, measured, against, triangulation, is, a, method, of, horizontal, location, favoured, in, the, days, before, edm, and, gps, measurement, it, can, determine, distances, elevations, and, directions, between, distant, objects, since, the, early, days, of, surveying, this, was, the, primary, method, of, determining, accurate, positions, of, objects, for, topographic, maps, of, large, areas, a, surveyor, first, needs, to, know, the, horizontal, distance, between, two, of, the, objects, known, as, the, baseline, then, the, heights, distances, and, angular, position, of, other, objects, can, be, derived, as, long, as, they, are, visible, from, one, of, the, original, objects, high, accuracy, transits, or, theodolites, were, used, and, angle, measurements, were, repeated, for, increased, accuracy, see, also, triangulation, in, three, dimensions, offsetting, is, an, alternate, method, of, determining, the, position, of, objects, and, was, often, used, to, measure, imprecise, features, such, as, riverbanks, the, surveyor, would, mark, and, measure, two, known, positions, on, the, ground, roughly, parallel, to, the, feature, and, mark, out, a, baseline, between, them, at, regular, intervals, a, distance, was, measured, at, right, angles, from, the, first, line, to, the, feature, the, measurements, could, then, be, plotted, on, a, plan, or, map, and, the, points, at, the, ends, of, the, offset, lines, could, be, joined, to, show, the, feature, traversing, is, a, common, method, of, surveying, smaller, areas, the, surveyor, starts, from, an, old, reference, mark, or, known, position, and, places, a, network, of, reference, marks, covering, the, survey, area, they, then, measure, bearings, and, distances, between, the, reference, marks, and, to, the, target, features, most, traverses, form, a, loop, pattern, or, link, between, two, prior, reference, marks, so, the, surveyor, can, check, their, measurements, many, surveys, do, not, calculate, positions, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, but, instead, measure, the, relative, positions, of, objects, however, often, the, surveyed, items, need, to, be, compared, to, outside, data, such, as, boundary, lines, or, previous, survey, s, objects, the, oldest, way, of, describing, a, position, is, via, latitude, and, longitude, and, often, a, height, above, sea, level, as, the, surveying, profession, grew, it, created, cartesian, coordinate, systems, to, simplify, the, mathematics, for, surveys, over, small, parts, of, the, earth, the, simplest, coordinate, systems, assume, that, the, earth, is, flat, and, measure, from, an, arbitrary, point, known, as, a, datum, singular, form, of, data, the, coordinate, system, allows, easy, calculation, of, the, distances, and, direction, between, objects, over, small, areas, large, areas, distort, due, to, the, earth, s, curvature, north, is, often, defined, as, true, north, at, the, datum, for, larger, regions, it, is, necessary, to, model, the, shape, of, the, earth, using, an, ellipsoid, or, a, geoid, many, countries, have, created, coordinate, grids, customized, to, lessen, error, in, their, area, of, the, earth, a, basic, tenet, of, surveying, is, that, no, measurement, is, perfect, and, that, there, will, always, be, a, small, amount, of, error, there, are, three, classes, of, survey, errors, surveyors, avoid, these, errors, by, calibrating, their, equipment, using, consistent, methods, and, by, good, design, of, their, reference, network, repeated, measurements, can, be, averaged, and, any, outlier, measurements, discarded, independent, checks, like, measuring, a, point, from, two, or, more, locations, or, using, two, different, methods, are, used, and, errors, can, be, detected, by, comparing, the, results, of, two, or, more, measurements, thus, utilizing, redundancy, once, the, surveyor, has, calculated, the, level, of, the, errors, in, his, or, her, work, it, is, adjusted, this, is, the, process, of, distributing, the, error, between, all, measurements, each, observation, is, weighted, according, to, how, much, of, the, total, error, it, is, likely, to, have, caused, and, part, of, that, error, is, allocated, to, it, in, a, proportional, way, the, most, common, methods, of, adjustment, are, the, bowditch, method, also, known, as, the, compass, rule, and, the, principle, of, least, squares, method, the, surveyor, must, be, able, to, distinguish, between, accuracy, and, precision, in, the, united, states, surveyors, and, civil, engineers, use, units, of, feet, wherein, a, survey, foot, breaks, down, into, 10ths, and, 100ths, many, deed, descriptions, containing, distances, are, often, expressed, using, these, units, 125, 25, ft, on, the, subject, of, accuracy, surveyors, are, often, held, to, a, standard, of, one, one, hundredth, of, a, foot, about, 1, 8, inch, calculation, and, mapping, tolerances, are, much, smaller, wherein, achieving, near, perfect, closures, are, desired, though, tolerances, will, vary, from, project, to, project, in, the, field, and, day, to, day, usage, beyond, a, 100th, of, a, foot, is, often, impractical, local, organisations, or, regulatory, bodies, class, specializations, of, surveying, in, different, ways, broad, groups, are, based, on, the, considerations, and, true, shape, of, the, earth, surveying, is, broadly, classified, into, two, types, plane, surveying, assumes, the, earth, is, flat, curvature, and, spheroidal, shape, of, the, earth, is, neglected, in, this, type, of, surveying, all, triangles, formed, by, joining, survey, lines, are, considered, as, plane, triangles, it, is, employed, for, small, survey, works, where, errors, due, to, the, earth, s, shape, are, too, small, to, matter, in, geodetic, surveying, the, curvature, of, the, earth, is, taken, into, account, while, calculating, reduced, levels, angles, bearings, and, distances, this, type, of, surveying, is, usually, employed, for, large, survey, works, survey, works, up, to, 100, square, miles, 260, square, kilometers, are, treated, as, plane, and, beyond, that, are, treated, as, geodetic, in, geodetic, surveying, necessary, corrections, are, applied, to, reduced, levels, bearings, and, other, observations, the, basic, principles, of, surveying, have, changed, little, over, the, ages, but, the, tools, used, by, surveyors, have, evolved, engineering, especially, civil, engineering, often, needs, surveyors, surveyors, help, determine, the, placement, of, roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, pipelines, retaining, walls, bridges, and, buildings, they, establish, the, boundaries, of, legal, descriptions, and, political, divisions, they, also, provide, advice, and, data, for, geographical, information, systems, gis, that, record, land, features, and, boundaries, surveyors, must, have, a, thorough, knowledge, of, algebra, basic, calculus, geometry, and, trigonometry, they, must, also, know, the, laws, that, deal, with, surveys, real, property, and, contracts, most, jurisdictions, recognize, three, different, levels, of, qualification, related, professions, include, cartographers, hydrographers, geodesists, photogrammetrists, and, topographers, as, well, as, civil, engineers, and, geomatics, engineers, licensing, requirements, vary, with, jurisdiction, and, are, commonly, consistent, within, national, borders, prospective, surveyors, usually, have, to, receive, a, degree, in, surveying, followed, by, a, detailed, examination, of, their, knowledge, of, surveying, law, and, principles, specific, to, the, region, they, wish, to, practice, in, and, undergo, a, period, of, on, the, job, training, or, portfolio, building, before, they, are, awarded, a, license, to, practise, licensed, surveyors, usually, receive, a, post, nominal, which, varies, depending, on, where, they, qualified, the, system, has, replaced, older, apprenticeship, systems, a, licensed, land, surveyor, is, generally, required, to, sign, and, seal, all, plans, the, state, dictates, the, format, showing, their, name, and, registration, number, in, many, jurisdictions, surveyors, must, mark, their, registration, number, on, survey, monuments, when, setting, boundary, corners, monuments, take, the, form, of, capped, iron, rods, concrete, monuments, or, nails, with, washers, most, countries, governments, regulate, at, least, some, forms, of, surveying, their, survey, agencies, establish, regulations, and, standards, standards, control, accuracy, surveying, credentials, monumentation, of, boundaries, and, maintenance, of, geodetic, networks, many, nations, devolve, this, authority, to, regional, entities, or, states, provinces, cadastral, surveys, tend, to, be, the, most, regulated, because, of, the, permanence, of, the, work, lot, boundaries, established, by, cadastral, surveys, may, stand, for, hundreds, of, years, without, modification, most, jurisdictions, also, have, a, form, of, professional, institution, representing, local, surveyors, these, institutes, often, endorse, or, license, potential, surveyors, as, well, as, set, and, enforce, ethical, standards, the, largest, institution, is, the, international, federation, of, surveyors, abbreviated, fig, for, french, f, d, ration, internationale, des, g, om, tres, they, represent, the, survey, industry, worldwide, most, english, speaking, countries, consider, building, surveying, a, distinct, profession, they, have, their, own, professional, associations, and, licensing, requirements, a, building, surveyor, can, provide, technical, building, advice, on, existing, buildings, new, buildings, design, compliance, with, regulations, such, as, planning, and, building, control, a, building, surveyor, normally, acts, on, behalf, of, his, or, her, client, ensuring, that, their, vested, interests, remain, protected, the, royal, institution, of, chartered, surveyors, rics, is, a, world, recognised, governing, body, for, those, working, within, the, built, environment, one, of, the, primary, roles, of, the, land, surveyor, is, to, determine, the, boundary, of, real, property, on, the, ground, the, surveyor, must, determine, where, the, adjoining, landowners, wish, to, put, the, boundary, the, boundary, is, established, in, legal, documents, and, plans, prepared, by, attorneys, engineers, and, land, surveyors, the, surveyor, then, puts, monuments, on, the, corners, of, the, new, boundary, they, might, also, find, or, resurvey, the, corners, of, the, property, monumented, by, prior, surveys, cadastral, land, surveyors, are, licensed, by, governments, the, cadastral, survey, branch, of, the, bureau, of, land, management, blm, conducts, most, cadastral, surveys, in, the, united, states, they, consult, with, forest, service, national, park, service, army, corps, of, engineers, bureau, of, indian, affairs, fish, and, wildlife, service, bureau, of, reclamation, and, others, the, blm, used, to, be, known, as, the, united, states, general, land, office, glo, in, states, organized, per, the, public, land, survey, system, plss, surveyors, must, carry, out, blm, cadastral, surveys, under, that, system, cadastral, surveyors, often, have, to, work, around, changes, to, the, earth, that, obliterate, or, damage, boundary, monuments, when, this, happens, they, must, consider, evidence, that, is, not, recorded, on, the, title, deed, this, is, known, as, extrinsic, evidence, quantity, surveying, is, a, profession, that, deals, with, the, costs, and, contracts, of, construction, projects, a, quantity, surveyor, is, an, expert, in, estimating, the, costs, of, materials, labor, and, time, needed, for, a, project, as, well, as, managing, the, financial, and, legal, aspects, of, the, project, a, quantity, surveyor, can, work, for, either, the, client, or, the, contractor, and, can, be, involved, in, different, stages, of, the, project, from, planning, to, completion, quantity, surveyors, are, also, known, as, chartered, surveyors, in, the, uk, some, u, s, presidents, were, land, surveyors, george, washington, and, abraham, lincoln, surveyed, colonial, or, frontier, territories, early, in, their, career, prior, to, serving, in, office, ferdinand, rudolph, hassler, is, considered, the, father, of, geodetic, surveying, in, the, u, s, david, t, abercrombie, practiced, land, surveying, before, starting, an, outfitter, store, of, excursion, goods, the, business, would, later, turn, into, abercrombie, fitch, lifestyle, clothing, store, percy, harrison, fawcett, was, a, british, surveyor, that, explored, the, jungles, of, south, america, attempting, to, find, the, lost, city, of, z, his, biography, and, expeditions, were, recounted, in, the, book, the, lost, city, of, z, and, were, later, adapted, on, film, screen, in, tadataka, produced, the, first, map, of, japan, using, modern, surveying, techniques, starting, in, 1800, at, the, age, of, 55
