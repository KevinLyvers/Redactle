the, ural, mountains, j, r, l, yoor, l, or, simply, the, urals, are, a, mountain, range, in, eurasia, that, runs, north, south, mostly, through, the, russian, federation, from, the, coast, of, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, river, ural, and, northwestern, kazakhstan, the, mountain, range, forms, part, of, the, conventional, boundary, between, the, continents, of, europe, and, asia, marking, the, separation, between, european, russia, and, siberia, vaygach, island, and, the, islands, of, novaya, zemlya, form, a, further, continuation, of, the, chain, to, the, north, into, the, arctic, ocean, the, average, altitudes, of, the, urals, are, around, 1, 000, 1, 300, metres, 3, 300, 4, 300, ft, the, highest, point, being, mount, narodnaya, which, reaches, a, height, of, 1, 894, metres, 6, 214, ft, the, mountains, lie, within, the, ural, geographical, region, and, significantly, overlap, with, the, ural, federal, district, and, the, ural, economic, region, their, resources, include, metal, ores, coal, and, precious, and, semi, precious, stones, since, the, 18th, century, the, mountains, have, contributed, significantly, to, the, mineral, sector, of, the, russian, economy, the, region, is, one, of, the, largest, centres, of, metallurgy, and, heavy, industry, production, in, russia, as, attested, by, sigismund, von, herberstein, in, the, 16th, century, russians, called, the, ural, range, by, a, variety, of, names, derived, from, the, russian, words, for, rock, stone, and, belt, the, modern, russian, name, for, the, urals, ural, first, appearing, in, the, 16th, 17th, century, during, the, russian, conquest, of, siberia, was, initially, applied, to, its, southern, parts, and, gained, currency, as, the, name, of, the, entire, range, during, the, 18th, century, it, might, have, been, borrowed, from, either, turkic, stone, belt, bashkir, where, the, same, name, is, used, for, the, range, or, ob, ugric, from, the, 13th, century, in, bashkortostan, there, has, been, a, legend, about, a, hero, named, ural, who, sacrificed, his, life, for, the, sake, of, his, people, who, then, poured, a, stone, pile, over, his, grave, which, later, turned, into, the, ural, mountains, possibilities, include, bashkir, elevation, upland, and, mansi, mountain, peak, top, of, the, mountain, v, n, tatischev, believes, that, this, oronym, is, set, to, belt, and, associates, it, with, the, turkic, verb, oralu, gird, i, g, dobrodomov, suggests, a, transition, from, aral, to, ural, explained, on, the, basis, of, ancient, bulgar, chuvash, dialects, geographer, e, v, hawks, believes, that, the, name, goes, back, to, the, bashkir, folklore, ural, batyr, the, evenk, geographical, term, era, mountain, has, also, been, theorized, cf, also, ewenk, r, l, pl, mountains, finno, ugrist, scholars, consider, ural, deriving, from, the, ostyak, word, urr, meaning, chain, of, mountains, turkologists, on, the, other, hand, have, achieved, majority, support, for, their, assertion, that, ural, in, tatar, means, a, belt, and, recall, that, an, earlier, name, for, the, range, was, stone, belt, as, merchants, from, the, middle, east, traded, with, the, bashkirs, and, other, people, living, on, the, western, slopes, of, the, ural, as, far, north, as, great, perm, since, the, 10th, century, medieval, mideastern, geographers, had, been, aware, of, the, existence, of, the, mountain, range, in, its, entirety, stretching, as, far, as, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, north, the, first, russian, mention, of, the, mountains, to, the, east, of, the, east, european, plain, is, provided, by, the, primary, chronicle, where, it, describes, the, novgorodian, expedition, to, the, upper, reaches, of, the, pechora, in, the, year, 1096, during, the, next, few, centuries, novgorodians, engaged, in, fur, trading, with, the, local, population, and, collected, tribute, from, yugra, and, great, perm, slowly, expanding, southwards, the, rivers, chusovaya, and, belaya, were, first, mentioned, in, the, chronicles, of, 1396, and, 1468, respectively, in, 1430, the, town, of, solikamsk, kama, salt, was, founded, on, the, kama, at, the, foothills, of, the, ural, where, salt, was, produced, in, open, pans, ivan, iii, of, moscow, captured, perm, pechora, and, yugra, from, the, declining, novgorod, republic, in, 1472, with, the, excursions, of, 1483, and, 1499, 1500, across, the, ural, moscow, managed, to, subjugate, yugra, completely, nevertheless, around, the, early, 16th, century, polish, geographer, maciej, of, miech, w, in, his, influential, tractatus, de, duabus, sarmatiis, 1517, argued, that, there, were, no, mountains, in, eastern, europe, at, all, challenging, the, point, of, view, of, some, authors, of, classical, antiquity, which, were, popular, during, the, renaissance, only, after, sigismund, von, herberstein, in, his, notes, on, muscovite, affairs, 1549, had, reported, following, russian, sources, that, there, are, mountains, behind, the, pechora, and, identified, them, with, the, riphean, mountains, and, hyperboreans, of, ancient, authors, did, the, existence, of, the, ural, or, at, least, of, its, northern, part, become, firmly, established, in, the, western, geography, the, middle, and, southern, ural, were, still, largely, unavailable, and, unknown, to, the, russian, or, western, european, geographers, in, the, 1550s, after, the, tsardom, of, russia, had, defeated, the, khanate, of, kazan, and, proceeded, to, gradually, annex, the, lands, of, the, bashkirs, the, russians, finally, reached, the, southern, part, of, the, mountain, chain, in, 1574, they, founded, ufa, the, upper, reaches, of, the, kama, and, chusovaya, in, the, middle, ural, still, unexplored, as, well, as, parts, of, transuralia, still, held, by, the, hostile, siberian, khanate, were, granted, to, the, stroganovs, by, several, decrees, of, the, tsar, in, 1558, 1574, the, stroganovs, land, provided, the, staging, ground, for, yermak, s, incursion, into, siberia, yermak, crossed, the, ural, from, the, chusovaya, to, the, tagil, around, 1581, in, 1597, babinov, s, road, was, built, across, the, ural, from, solikamsk, to, the, valley, of, the, tura, where, the, town, of, verkhoturye, upper, tura, was, founded, in, 1598, customs, was, established, in, verkhoturye, shortly, thereafter, and, the, road, was, made, the, only, legal, connection, between, european, russia, and, siberia, for, a, long, time, in, 1648, the, town, of, kungur, was, founded, at, the, western, foothills, of, the, middle, ural, during, the, 17th, century, the, first, deposits, of, iron, and, copper, ores, mica, gemstones, and, other, minerals, were, discovered, in, the, ural, iron, and, copper, smelting, works, emerged, in, particular, the, gumyoshevsky, mine, was, established, in, 1702, at, an, ancient, copper, deposit, known, since, bronze, age, so, called, legendary, copper, mountain, which, also, produced, malachite, mining, intensified, particularly, quickly, during, the, reign, of, peter, i, of, russia, in, 1720, 1722, he, commissioned, vasily, tatishchev, to, oversee, and, develop, the, mining, and, smelting, works, in, the, ural, tatishchev, proposed, a, new, copper, smelting, factory, in, yegoshikha, which, would, eventually, become, the, core, of, the, city, of, perm, and, a, new, iron, smelting, factory, on, the, iset, which, would, become, the, largest, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, construction, and, give, birth, to, the, city, of, yekaterinburg, both, factories, were, actually, founded, by, tatishchev, s, successor, georg, wilhelm, de, gennin, in, 1723, tatishchev, returned, to, the, ural, on, the, order, of, empress, anna, to, succeed, de, gennin, in, 1734, 1737, transportation, of, the, output, of, the, smelting, works, to, the, markets, of, european, russia, necessitated, the, construction, of, the, siberian, route, from, yekaterinburg, across, the, ural, to, kungur, and, yegoshikha, perm, and, further, to, moscow, which, was, completed, in, 1763, and, rendered, babinov, s, road, obsolete, in, 1745, gold, was, discovered, in, the, ural, at, beryozovskoye, and, later, at, other, deposits, it, has, been, mined, since, 1747, the, first, ample, geographic, survey, of, the, ural, mountains, was, completed, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, the, russian, historian, and, geographer, vasily, tatishchev, under, the, orders, of, peter, i, earlier, in, the, 17th, century, rich, ore, deposits, were, discovered, in, the, mountains, and, their, systematic, extraction, began, in, the, early, 18th, century, eventually, turning, the, region, into, the, largest, mineral, base, of, russia, one, of, the, first, scientific, descriptions, of, the, mountains, was, published, in, 1770, 71, over, the, next, century, the, region, was, studied, by, scientists, from, a, number, of, countries, including, russia, geologist, alexander, karpinsky, botanist, porfiry, krylov, and, zoologist, leonid, sabaneyev, the, united, kingdom, geologist, sir, roderick, murchison, france, paleontologist, douard, de, verneuil, and, germany, naturalist, alexander, von, humboldt, geologist, alexander, keyserling, in, 1845, murchison, who, had, according, to, encyclop, dia, britannica, compiled, the, first, geologic, map, of, the, ural, in, 1841, published, the, geology, of, russia, in, europe, and, the, ural, mountains, with, de, verneuil, and, keyserling, the, first, railway, across, the, urals, had, been, built, by, 1878, and, linked, perm, to, yekaterinburg, via, chusovoy, kushva, and, nizhny, tagil, in, 1890, a, railway, linked, ufa, and, chelyabinsk, via, zlatoust, in, 1896, this, section, became, a, part, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, in, 1909, yet, another, railway, connecting, perm, and, yekaterinburg, passed, through, kungur, by, the, way, of, the, siberian, route, it, has, eventually, replaced, the, ufa, chelyabinsk, section, as, the, main, trunk, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, the, highest, peak, of, the, ural, mount, narodnaya, elevation, 1, 895, m, was, identified, in, 1927, during, the, soviet, industrialization, in, the, 1930s, the, city, of, magnitogorsk, was, founded, in, the, south, eastern, ural, as, a, center, of, iron, smelting, and, steelmaking, during, the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, 1942, the, mountains, became, a, key, element, in, nazi, planning, for, the, territories, which, they, expected, to, conquer, in, the, ussr, faced, with, the, threat, of, having, a, significant, part, of, the, soviet, territories, occupied, by, the, enemy, the, government, evacuated, many, of, the, industrial, enterprises, of, european, russia, and, ukraine, to, the, eastern, foothills, of, the, ural, considered, a, safe, place, out, of, reach, of, the, german, bombers, and, troops, three, giant, tank, factories, were, established, at, the, uralmash, in, sverdlovsk, as, yekaterinburg, used, to, be, known, uralvagonzavod, in, nizhny, tagil, and, chelyabinsk, tractor, plant, in, chelyabinsk, after, the, war, in, 1947, 1948, chum, labytnangi, railway, built, with, the, forced, labor, of, gulag, inmates, crossed, the, polar, ural, mayak, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, southeast, of, yekaterinburg, was, a, center, of, the, soviet, nuclear, industry, and, site, of, the, kyshtym, disaster, the, ural, mountains, extend, about, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, from, the, kara, sea, to, the, kazakh, steppe, along, the, border, of, kazakhstan, vaygach, island, and, the, island, of, novaya, zemlya, form, a, further, continuation, of, the, chain, on, the, north, geographically, this, range, marks, the, northern, part, of, the, border, between, europe, and, asia, its, highest, peak, is, mount, narodnaya, approximately, 1, 895, m, 6, 217, ft, in, elevation, transverse, faults, divide, the, mountain, chain, into, seven, major, units, each, of, which, has, its, own, typical, pattern, of, mountain, ridges, from, north, to, south, these, are, the, pay, khoy, zapolyarnyy, pripolyarnyy, polyarnyy, severnyy, sredniy, yuzhnny, ural, and, mugodzhary, the, average, altitudes, of, the, urals, are, around, 1, 000, 1, 300, m, 3, 300, 4, 300, ft, the, highest, point, being, narodnaya, peak, in, the, pripolyarnyy, ural, which, reaches, a, height, of, 1, 894, metres, 6, 214, ft, by, topography, and, other, natural, features, the, urals, are, divided, from, north, to, south, into, the, polar, or, arctic, nether, polar, or, sub, arctic, northern, central, and, southern, parts, the, polar, urals, extend, for, about, 385, kilometers, 239, mi, from, mount, konstantinov, kamen, in, the, north, to, the, river, khulga, in, the, south, they, have, an, area, of, about, 25, 000, km, 2, 9, 700, sq, mi, and, a, strongly, dissected, relief, the, maximum, height, is, 1, 499, m, 4, 918, ft, at, mount, payer, and, the, average, height, is, 1, 000, to, 1, 100, m, 3, 300, to, 3, 600, ft, the, mountains, of, the, polar, ural, have, exposed, rock, with, sharp, ridges, though, flattened, or, rounded, tops, are, also, found, the, nether, polar, ural, are, higher, and, up, to, 150, km, 93, mi, wider, than, the, polar, urals, they, include, the, highest, peaks, of, the, range, mount, narodnaya, 1, 895, m, 6, 217, ft, mount, karpinsky, 1, 878, m, 6, 161, ft, and, manaraga, 1, 662, m, 5, 453, ft, they, extend, for, more, than, 225, km, 140, mi, south, to, the, shchugor, the, many, ridges, are, sawtooth, shaped, and, dissected, by, river, valleys, both, polar, and, nether, polar, urals, are, typically, alpine, they, bear, traces, of, pleistocene, glaciation, along, with, permafrost, and, extensive, modern, glaciation, including, 143, extant, glaciers, the, northern, ural, consist, of, a, series, of, parallel, ridges, up, to, 1, 000, 1, 200, m, 3, 300, 3, 900, ft, in, height, and, longitudinal, hollows, they, are, elongated, from, north, to, south, and, stretch, for, about, 560, km, 350, mi, from, the, river, usa, most, of, the, tops, are, flattened, but, those, of, the, highest, mountains, such, as, telposiz, 1, 617, m, 5, 305, ft, and, konzhakovsky, stone, 1, 569, m, 5, 148, ft, have, a, dissected, topography, intensive, weathering, has, produced, vast, areas, of, eroded, stone, on, the, mountain, slopes, and, summits, of, the, northern, areas, the, central, ural, are, the, lowest, part, of, the, ural, with, smooth, mountain, tops, the, highest, mountain, being, 994, m, 3, 261, ft, basegi, they, extend, south, from, the, river, ufa, the, relief, of, the, southern, ural, is, more, complex, with, numerous, valleys, and, parallel, ridges, directed, south, west, and, meridionally, the, range, includes, the, ilmensky, mountains, separated, from, the, main, ridges, by, the, miass, the, maximum, height, is, 1, 640, m, 5, 380, ft, mount, yamantau, and, the, width, reaches, 250, km, 160, mi, other, notable, peaks, lie, along, the, iremel, mountain, ridge, bolshoy, iremel, and, maly, iremel, and, nurgush, the, southern, urals, extend, some, 550, km, 340, mi, up, to, the, sharp, westward, bend, of, the, river, ural, and, terminate, in, the, guberlin, mountains, and, finally, in, the, wide, mughalzhar, hills, the, urals, are, among, the, world, s, oldest, extant, mountain, ranges, some, have, estimated, the, age, to, be, 250, to, 300, million, years, the, elevation, of, the, mountains, is, unusually, high, they, formed, during, the, uralian, orogeny, due, to, the, collision, of, the, eastern, edge, of, the, supercontinent, laurasia, with, the, young, and, rheologically, weak, continent, of, kazakhstania, which, now, underlies, much, of, kazakhstan, and, west, siberia, west, of, the, irtysh, and, intervening, island, arcs, the, collision, lasted, nearly, 90, million, years, in, the, late, carboniferous, early, triassic, unlike, the, other, major, orogens, of, the, paleozoic, appalachians, caledonides, variscides, the, urals, have, not, undergone, post, orogenic, extensional, collapse, and, are, unusually, well, preserved, for, their, age, being, underlaid, by, a, pronounced, crustal, root, east, and, south, of, the, urals, much, of, the, orogen, is, buried, beneath, later, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, sediments, the, adjacent, pay, khoy, ridge, to, the, north, and, novaya, zemlya, are, not, a, part, of, the, uralian, orogen, and, formed, later, many, deformed, and, metamorphosed, rocks, mostly, of, paleozoic, age, surface, within, the, urals, the, sedimentary, and, volcanic, layers, are, folded, and, faulted, the, sediments, to, the, west, of, the, ural, mountains, are, formed, of, limestone, dolomite, and, sandstone, left, from, ancient, shallow, seas, the, eastern, side, is, dominated, by, basalts, the, western, slope, of, the, ural, mountains, has, predominantly, karst, topography, especially, in, the, sylva, basin, which, is, a, tributary, of, the, chusovaya, it, is, composed, of, severely, eroded, sedimentary, rocks, sandstones, and, limestones, that, are, about, 350, million, years, old, there, are, many, caves, sinkholes, and, underground, streams, the, karst, topography, is, much, less, developed, on, the, eastern, slopes, the, eastern, slopes, are, relatively, flat, with, some, hills, and, rocky, outcrops, and, contain, alternating, volcanic, and, sedimentary, layers, dated, to, the, middle, paleozoic, era, most, high, mountains, consist, of, weather, resistant, rocks, such, as, quartzite, schist, and, gabbro, that, are, between, 395, and, 570, million, years, old, the, river, valleys, are, underlain, by, limestone, the, ural, mountains, contain, about, 48, species, of, economically, valuable, ores, and, minerals, eastern, regions, are, rich, in, chalcopyrite, nickel, oxide, e, g, serov, nickel, deposit, gold, platinum, chromite, and, magnetite, ores, as, well, as, in, coal, chelyabinsk, oblast, bauxite, talc, fireclay, and, abrasives, the, western, urals, contain, deposits, of, coal, oil, natural, gas, ishimbay, and, krasnokamsk, areas, and, potassium, salts, both, slopes, are, rich, in, bituminous, coal, and, lignite, and, the, largest, deposit, of, bituminous, coal, is, in, the, north, pechora, field, the, specialty, of, the, urals, is, precious, and, semi, precious, stones, such, as, emerald, amethyst, aquamarine, jasper, rhodonite, malachite, and, diamond, some, of, the, deposits, such, as, the, magnetite, ores, at, magnitogorsk, are, already, nearly, depleted, many, rivers, originate, in, the, ural, mountains, the, western, slopes, south, of, the, border, between, the, komi, republic, and, perm, krai, and, the, eastern, slopes, south, of, approximately, 54, 30, n, drain, into, the, caspian, sea, via, the, kama, and, ural, basins, the, tributaries, of, the, kama, include, the, vishera, chusovaya, and, belaya, and, originate, on, both, the, eastern, and, western, slopes, the, rest, of, the, urals, drain, into, the, arctic, ocean, mainly, via, the, pechora, basin, in, the, west, which, includes, the, ilych, shchugor, and, the, usa, and, via, the, ob, basin, in, the, east, which, includes, the, tobol, tavda, iset, tura, and, severnaya, sosva, the, rivers, are, frozen, for, more, than, half, the, year, generally, the, western, rivers, have, higher, flow, volume, than, the, eastern, ones, especially, in, the, northern, and, nether, polar, regions, rivers, are, slower, in, the, southern, urals, this, is, because, of, low, precipitation, and, the, relatively, warm, climate, resulting, in, less, snow, and, more, evaporation, the, mountains, contain, a, number, of, deep, lakes, the, eastern, slopes, of, the, southern, and, central, urals, have, most, of, these, among, the, largest, of, which, are, the, uvildy, itkul, turgoyak, and, tavatuy, lakes, the, lakes, found, on, the, western, slopes, are, less, numerous, and, also, smaller, lake, bolshoye, shchuchye, the, deepest, lake, in, the, polar, urals, is, 136, meters, 446, ft, deep, other, lakes, too, are, found, in, the, glacial, valleys, of, this, region, spas, and, sanatoriums, have, been, built, to, take, advantage, of, the, medicinal, muds, found, in, some, of, the, mountain, lakes, the, climate, of, the, urals, is, continental, the, mountain, ridges, elongated, from, north, to, south, effectively, absorb, sunlight, thereby, increasing, the, temperature, the, areas, west, of, the, ural, mountains, are, 1, 2, c, 1, 8, 3, 6, f, warmer, in, winter, than, the, eastern, regions, because, the, former, are, warmed, by, atlantic, winds, whereas, the, eastern, slopes, are, chilled, by, siberian, air, masses, the, average, january, temperatures, increase, in, the, western, areas, from, 20, c, 4, f, in, the, polar, to, 15, c, 5, f, in, the, southern, urals, and, the, corresponding, temperatures, in, july, are, 10, and, 20, c, 50, and, 68, f, the, western, areas, also, receive, more, rainfall, than, the, eastern, ones, by, 150, 300, mm, 5, 9, 11, 8, in, per, year, this, is, because, the, mountains, trap, clouds, from, the, atlantic, ocean, the, highest, precipitation, approximately, 1, 000, mm, 39, in, is, in, the, northern, urals, with, up, to, 1, 000, cm, 390, in, snow, the, eastern, areas, receive, from, 500, 600, mm, 20, 24, in, in, the, north, to, 300, 400, mm, 12, 16, in, in, the, south, maximum, precipitation, occurs, in, the, summer, the, winter, is, dry, because, of, the, siberian, high, the, landscapes, of, the, urals, vary, with, both, latitude, and, longitude, and, are, dominated, by, forests, and, steppes, the, southern, area, of, the, mughalzhar, hills, is, a, semidesert, steppes, lie, mostly, in, the, southern, and, especially, south, eastern, urals, meadow, steppes, have, developed, on, the, lower, parts, of, mountain, slopes, and, are, covered, with, zigzag, and, mountain, clovers, serratula, gmelinii, dropwort, meadow, grass, and, bromus, inermis, reaching, the, height, of, 60, 80, centimetres, 24, 31, in, much, of, the, land, is, cultivated, to, the, south, the, meadow, steppes, become, more, sparse, dry, and, low, the, steep, gravelly, slopes, of, the, mountains, and, hills, of, the, eastern, slopes, of, the, southern, urals, are, mostly, covered, with, rocky, steppes, river, valleys, contain, willow, poplar, and, caragana, shrubs, forest, landscapes, of, the, urals, are, diverse, especially, in, the, southern, part, the, western, areas, are, dominated, by, dark, coniferous, taiga, forests, which, change, to, mixed, and, deciduous, forests, in, the, south, the, eastern, mountain, slopes, have, light, coniferous, taiga, forests, the, northern, urals, are, dominated, by, conifers, namely, siberian, fir, siberian, pine, scots, pine, siberian, spruce, norway, spruce, and, siberian, larch, as, well, as, by, silver, and, downy, birches, the, forests, are, much, sparser, in, the, polar, urals, whereas, in, other, parts, of, the, ural, mountains, they, grow, up, to, an, altitude, of, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, in, the, polar, urals, the, tree, line, is, at, 250, 400, metres, 820, 1, 310, ft, the, low, polar, forests, are, mixed, with, swamps, lichens, bogs, and,
