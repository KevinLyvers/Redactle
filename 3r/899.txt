from, his, memoir, baburnama, it, always, appears, to, me, that, one, of, the, chief, defects, of, hindustan, is, the, want, of, artificial, watercourses, i, had, intended, wherever, i, might, fix, my, residence, to, construct, water, wheels, to, produce, an, artificial, stream, and, to, lay, out, an, elegant, and, regularly, planned, pleasure, ground, shortly, after, coming, to, agra, i, passed, the, jumna, with, this, object, in, view, and, examined, the, country, to, pitch, upon, a, fit, spot, for, a, garden, the, whole, was, so, ugly, and, detestable, that, i, repassed, the, river, quite, repulsed, and, disgusted, in, consequence, of, the, want, of, beauty, and, of, the, disagreeable, aspect, of, the, country, i, gave, up, my, intention, of, making, a, charbagh, garden, house, but, as, no, better, situation, presented, itself, near, agra, i, was, finally, compelled, to, make, the, best, of, this, same, spot, in, every, corner, i, planted, suitable, gardens, in, every, garden, i, sowed, roses, and, narcissus, regularly, and, in, beds, corresponding, to, each, other, we, were, annoyed, by, three, things, in, hindustan, one, was, its, heat, another, the, strong, winds, and, the, third, its, dust, baths, were, the, means, of, removing, all, three, inconveniences, very, few, vestiges, remain, of, babur, s, city, of, his, fruit, and, flower, gardens, palaces,

to, babur, but, revolted, against, his, son, in, this, brief, interruption, in, mughal, rule, between, 1540, and, 1556, sher, shah, suri, established, the, short, lived, sur, empire, and, the, region, was, eventually, reconquered, by, akbar, in, the, second, battle, of, panipat, in, 1556, under, akbar, reigned, 1556, 1605, and, followed, by, his, grandson, shah, jahan, agra, was, immortalised, in, the, history, of, the, world, akbar, built, the, modern, city, of, agra, on, the, right, bank, of, yamuna, where, the, majority, of, its, part, still, lies, he, converted, the, city, into, a, great,

making, agra, a, centre, for, learning, arts, commerce, and, religion, akbar, also, built, a, new, capital, city, of, fatehpur, sikri, around, 35, km, from, agra, the, new, capital, city, was, later, abandoned, before, his, death, agra, had, become, probably, one, of, the, biggest, cities, in, the, east, with, huge, amounts, of, trade, and, commerce, happening, through, its, bazaars, the, english, traveller, ralph, fitch, who, visited, agra, in, september, 1585, in, the, life, time, of, akbar, writes, about, the, town, agra, is, a, very, great, city, and, populous, built, with, stone, having, fair, and, large, streets, with, a, fair, river, running, by, it, agra, and, fatehpur, sikri, are, two, very, great, cities, either, of, them, much, greater, than, london, and, very, populous, between, agra, and, fatehpur, are, twelve, miles, kos, in, reality, and, all, the, way, is, a, market, of, victuals, and, other, things, as, full, as, though, a, man, were, still, in, a, town, and, so, many, people, as, if, a, man, were, in, a, market, these, impressions, of, fitch, are, corroborated, by, another, european, traveller, william, finch, who, remarked, about, agra, it, is, spacious, large, populous, beyond, measure, that, you, can, hardly, pass, the, street, agra, continued, to, expand, and, flourish, during, akbar, s, successor, jahangir, s, reign, as, he, wrote, in, his, autobiography, tuzuk, e, jahangiri, the, habitable, part, of, agra, extends, on, both, sides, of, the, river, on, its, west, side, which, has, the, greater, population, its, circumference, is, seven,

buildings, of, three, or, four, storeys, in, it, the, mass, of, the, people, is, so, great, that, moving, about, in, the, lanes, and, bazars, is, difficult, akbar, s, successor, jahangir, reigned, 1605, 27, had, a, love, of, flora, and, fauna, and, laid, many, gardens, inside, the, red, fort, akbar, s, mausoleum, at, sikandra, was, completed, during, jahangir, s, reign, the, jahangiri, mahal, in, agra, fort, and, the, tomb, of, itmad, ud, daulah, were, also, constructed, during, the, reign, of, jahangir, jahangir, loved, lahore, and, kashmir, more, than, agra, but, the, latter, continued, to, be, the, first, city, of, the, realm, it, was, however, shah, jahan, reigned, 1628, 58, whose, building, activity, raised, agra, to, the, pinnacle, of, its, glory, shah, jahan, known, for, his, keen, interest, in, architecture, gave, agra, its, most, prized, monument, the, taj, mahal, built, in, loving, memory, of, his, wife, mumtaz, mahal, the, mausoleum, was, completed, in, 1653, the, jama, masjid, and, several, other, notable, buildings, like, the, diwan, i, am, the, diwan, i, khas, the, moti, masjid, etc, inside, the, fort, were, planned, and, executed, under, his, orders, shah, jahan, later, shifted, the, capital, to, shahjahanabad, now, known, as, delhi, in, the, year, 1648, followed, by, his, son, aurangzeb, reigned, 1658, 1707, moving, the, entire, court, to, delhi, in, 1658, with, this, agra, began, rapidly, declining, nevertheless, the, cultural, and, strategic, importance, of, agra, remained, unaffected, and, in, official, correspondence, it, continued, to, be, referred, to, as, the, second, capital, of, the, empire, the, decline, of, the, mughal, empire, caused, the, emergence, of, several, regional, kingdoms, and, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, control, of, the, city, fell, successively, to, the, jats, the, marathas, the, mughals, the, ruler, of, gwalior, and, finally, the, british, east, india, company, the, jats, of, bharatpur, waged,

many, parts, of, india, was, threatened, the, news, of, the, mutiny, at, meerut, reached, agra, on, 14, may, on, 30, may, some, companies, of, the, 44th, and, 67th, native, infantry, sent, to,

native, infantry, battalions, which, were, part, of, the, garrison, at, agra, were, successfully, disarmed, by, the, british, on, 31, may, however, when, the, gwalior, contingent, mutinied, on, 15, june, all, other, native, units, followed, on, 2, july, the, rebel, force, of, the, nimach, and, nasirabad, contingents, reached, fatehpur, sikri, fearing, advance, of, the, mutineers, to, agra, some,

the, mutineers, however, moved, over, to, delhi, it, being, a, more, important, attraction, for, the, rebels, despite, an, uprising, by, a, mob, and, extreme, disorder, in, the, city, the, british, managed, to, restore, partial, order, by, 8, july, delhi, in, turn, fell, to, the, british, in, september, following, which, an, infantry, brigade, led, by, brigadier, edward, greathed, arrived, in,

routed, this, minor, victory, for, the, british, was, named, the, battle, of, agra, it, is, to, be, said, that, the, uprising, in, agra, was, relatively, minor, compared, to, delhi, jhansi, meerut,
