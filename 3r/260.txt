comprises, the, seven, atolls, of, the, chagos, archipelago, with, over, 1, 000, individual, islands, many, very, small, amounting, to, a, total, land, area, of, 60, square, kilometres, 23, square, miles, the, largest, and, most, southerly, island, is, diego, garcia, 27, square, kilometres, 10, square, miles, the, site, of, a, joint, military, facility, of, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, official, administration, is, remote, from, london, though, the, local, capital, is, often, regarded, as, being, on, diego, garcia, the, only, inhabitants, are, british, and, united, states, military, personnel, and, associated, contractors, who, collectively, number, around, 3, 000, 2018, figures, the, forced, removal, of, chagossians, from, the, chagos, archipelago, occurred, between, 1968, and, 1973, the, chagossians, then, numbering, about, 2, 000, people, were, expelled, by, the, uk, government, to, mauritius, and, seychelles, even, from, the, outlying, islands, far, away, from, the, military, base, on, diego, garcia, today, the, chagossians, are, still, trying, to, return, but, the, uk, government, has, repeatedly, denied, them, the, right, of, return, despite, calls, from, numerous, human, rights, organisations, to, let, them, the, islands, are, off, limits, to, chagossians, tourists, and, the, media, since, the, 1980s, the, government, of, mauritius, has, sought, to, regain, control, over, the, chagos, archipelago, which, was, separated, from, the, then, crown, colony, of, mauritius, by, the, uk, in, 1965, to, form, the, british, indian, ocean, territory, a, february, 2019, advisory, opinion, of, the, international, court, of, justice, called, for, the, islands, to, be, given, to, mauritius, since, this, the, united, nations, general, assembly, and, the, international, tribunal, for, the, law, of, the, sea, have, reached, similar, decisions, on, 3, november, 2022, it, was, announced, that, the, uk, and, mauritius, had, decided, to, begin, negotiations, on, sovereignty, over, the, british, indian, ocean, territory, taking, into, account, the, international, legal, proceedings, however, in, december, 2023, it, was, reported, that, the, uk, government, was, planning, to, discontinue, the, talks, maldivian, mariners, knew, the, chagos, islands, well, in, maldivian, legends, they, are, known, as, f, lhavahi, or, hollhavai, the, latter, name, in, the, closer, southern, maldives, according, to, southern, maldivian, oral, tradition, traders, and, fishermen, were, occasionally, lost, at, sea, and, got, stranded, on, one, of, the, islands, of, the, chagos, eventually, they, were, rescued, and, brought, back, home, however, these, islands, were, judged, to, be, too, far, away, from, the, seat, of, the, maldivian, crown, to, be, settled, permanently, by, them, thus, for, many, centuries, the, chagos, were, ignored, by, their, northern, neighbours, the, islands, of, chagos, archipelago, were, charted, by, vasco, da, gama, in, the, early, 16th, century, and, then, claimed, in, the, 18th, century, by, france, as, a, possession, of, mauritius, they, were, first, settled, in, the, 18th, century, by, african, slaves, and, indian, contractors, brought, by, franco, mauritians, to, found, coconut, plantations, in, 1810, mauritius, was, captured, by, the, united, kingdom, and, france, subsequently, ceded, the, territory, in, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1814, in, 1965, the, united, kingdom, split, the, chagos, archipelago, from, mauritius, and, the, islands, of, aldabra, farquhar, and, desroches, des, roches, from, the, seychelles, to, form, the, british, indian, ocean, territory, biot, the, purpose, was, to, allow, the, construction, of, military, facilities, for, the, mutual, benefit, of, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, of, america, the, islands, were, formally, established, as, an, overseas, territory, of, the, united, kingdom, on, 8, november, 1965, a, few, weeks, after, the, decision, to, detach, the, chagos, archipelago, from, mauritius, the, united, nations, general, assembly, passed, resolution, 2066, on, 16, december, 1965, which, stated, that, this, detachment, of, part, of, the, colonial, territory, of, mauritius, was, against, customary, international, law, as, recorded, earlier, in, the, declaration, on, the, granting, of, independence, to, colonial, countries, and, peoples, of, 14, december, 1960, this, stated, that, any, attempt, aimed, at, the, partial, or, total, disruption, of, the, national, unity, and, the, territorial, integrity, of, a, country, is, incompatible, with, the, purposes, and, principles, of, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, largely, because, of, the, detachment, of, the, islands, the, international, court, of, justice, determined, in, 2019, that, the, decolonisation, of, mauritius, was, still, not, lawfully, completed, mauritius, became, an, independent, commonwealth, realm, in, march, 1968, and, subsequently, became, a, republic, also, within, the, commonwealth, in, march, 1992, on, 23, june, 1976, aldabra, farquhar, and, desroches, were, returned, to, the, seychelles, which, became, independent, as, a, republic, on, 29, june, 1976, the, islands, now, form, part, of, the, outer, islands, district, of, the, seychelles, subsequently, the, territory, has, consisted, only, of, the, six, main, island, groups, comprising, the, chagos, archipelago, in, 1966, the, uk, government, purchased, the, privately, owned, copra, plantations, and, closed, them, over, the, next, five, years, the, british, authorities, removed, the, entire, population, of, about, 2, 000, people, known, as, chagossians, or, ilois, from, diego, garcia, and, two, other, chagos, atolls, peros, banhos, and, salomon, islands, to, mauritius, in, 1971, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, signed, a, treaty, leasing, the, island, of, diego, garcia, to, the, us, military, for, the, purposes, of, building, a, large, air, and, naval, base, on, the, island, the, deal, was, important, to, the, uk, government, as, the, united, states, granted, it, a, substantial, discount, on, the, purchase, of, polaris, nuclear, missiles, in, return, for, the, use, of, the, islands, as, a, base, the, strategic, location, of, the, island, was, also, significant, at, the, centre, of, the, indian, ocean, and, to, counter, any, soviet, threat, in, the, region, during, the, 1980s, mauritius, asserted, a, claim, to, sovereignty, for, the, territory, citing, the, 1965, separation, as, illegal, under, international, law, despite, their, apparent, agreement, at, the, time, the, uk, does, not, recognise, mauritius, claim, but, has, agreed, to, cede, the, territory, to, mauritius, when, it, is, no, longer, required, for, defence, purposes, the, seychelles, also, made, a, sovereignty, claim, on, the, islands, the, islanders, who, now, mainly, reside, in, mauritius, and, seychelles, have, continually, asserted, their, right, to, return, to, diego, garcia, winning, important, legal, victories, in, the, high, court, of, england, and, wales, in, 2000, 2006, and, 2007, however, in, the, high, court, and, court, of, appeal, in, 2003, and, 2004, the, islanders, application, for, further, compensation, on, top, of, the, 14, 5, million, value, package, of, compensation, they, had, already, received, was, dismissed, by, the, court, on, 11, may, 2006, the, high, court, ruled, that, a, 2004, order, in, council, preventing, the, chagossians, resettlement, of, the, islands, was, unlawful, and, consequently, that, the, chagossians, were, entitled, to, return, to, the, outer, islands, of, the, chagos, archipelago, on, 23, may, 2007, this, was, confirmed, by, the, court, of, appeal, in, a, visit, sponsored, by,

move, as, well, as, a, necessary, move, to, improve, the, coral, populations, off, east, africa, and, therefore, sub, saharan, marine, supplies, some, chagossians, claimed, that, the, reserve, would, prevent, any, resettlement, due, to, the, inability, to, fish, in, protected, areas, the, chagossian, uk, based, diego, garcian, society, stated, that, it, welcomed, the, marine, reserve, noting, that, it, was, in, the, interest, of, chagossians, to, have, the, area, protected, while, they, were, exiled, and, that, it, could, be, renegotiated, upon, resettlement, the, foreign, office, claimed, the, reserve, was, made, without, prejudice, to, the, outcome, of, proceedings, before, the, european, court, of, human, rights, that, court, s, 2012, decision, was, not, in, favour, of, the,
