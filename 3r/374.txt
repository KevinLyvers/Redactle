the, sahel, region, s, h, l, from, arabic, s, il, coast, shore, or, sahelian, acacia, savanna, is, a, biogeographical, region, in, africa, it, is, the, transition, zone, between, the, more, humid, sudanian, savannas, to, its, south, and, the, drier, sahara, to, the, north, the, sahel, has, a, hot, semi, arid, climate, and, stretches, across, the, southernmost, latitudes, of, north, africa, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, red, sea, although, geographically, located, in, the, tropics, the, sahel, does, not, have, a, tropical, climate, especially, in, the, western, sahel, there, are, frequent, shortages, of, food, and, water, due, to, its, very, high, government, corruption, and, the, semi, arid, climate, this, is, exacerbated, by, very, high, birthrates, across, the, region, resulting, in, a, rapid, increase, in, population, in, recent, times, various, coups, insurgencies, terrorism, and, foreign, interventions, have, taken, place, in, many, sahel, countries, especially, across, former, fran, afrique, the, sahel, spans, 5, 900, km, 3, 670, mi, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, west, to, the, red, sea, in, the, east, in, a, belt, several, hundred, to, a, thousand, kilometers, c, 600, miles, wide, it, covers, an, area, of, 3, 053, 200, square, kilometers, 1, 178, 850, sq, mi, representing, a, climatic, and, ecological, transition, zone, with, hot, semi, desert, and, steppe, conditions, the, sahel, region, borders, the, more, humid, sudanian, savannas, to, its, south, and, the, dry, sahara, desert, to, the, north, this, ecoregion, is, also, called, the, sahelian, acacia, savanna, in, honour, of, its, most, prominent, and, very, drought, tolerant, genus, of, tree, the, topography, of, the, sahel, is, mainly, flat, most, of, the, region, lies, between, 200, and, 400, meters, 660, and, 1, 310, ft, in, elevation, several, isolated, plateaus, and, mountain, ranges, rise, from, the, sahel, e, g, marrah, mountains, a, r, mountains, ennedi, plateau, but, are, designated, as, separate, ecoregions, because, their, flora, and, fauna, are, distinct, from, the, surrounding, lowlands, e, g, east, saharan, woodlands, annual, rainfall, varies, from, around, 100, 200, mm, 4, 8, in, in, the, north, of, the, sahel, to, around, 700, 1, 000, mm, 28, 39, in, in, the, south, the, sahel, is, mostly, covered, in, grassland, and, savanna, with, areas, of, woodland, and, shrubland, grass, cover, is, fairly, continuous, across, the, region, dominated, by, annual, grass, species, such, as, cenchrus, biflorus, schoenefeldia, gracilis, and, aristida, stipoides, species, of, acacia, are, the, dominant, trees, with, acacia, tortilis, the, most, common, along, with, senegalia, senegal, and, senegalia, laeta, other, tree, species, include, commiphora, africana, balanites, aegyptiaca, faidherbia, albida, and, boscia, senegalensis, in, the, northern, part, of, the, sahel, areas, of, desert, shrub, including, panicum, turgidum, and, aristida, sieberiana, alternate, with, areas, of, grassland, and, savanna, during, the, long, dry, season, many, trees, lose, their, leaves, and, the, predominantly, annual, grasses, die, the, sahel, was, formerly, home, to, large, populations, of, grazing, mammals, including, the, scimitar, horned, oryx, oryx, dammah, dama, gazelle, gazella, dama, dorcas, gazelle, gazella, dorcas, red, fronted, gazelle, gazella, rufifrons, the, giant, prehistoric, buffalo, pelorovis, and, bubal, hartebeest, alcelaphus, buselaphus, buselaphus, along, with, large, predators, such, as, the, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, the, northwest, african, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, hecki, the, northeast, african, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, soemmeringii, and, the, lion, panthera, leo, the, larger, species, have, been, greatly, reduced, in, number, by, over, hunting, and, competition, with, livestock, and, several, species, are, vulnerable, dorcas, gazelle, cheetah, lion, and, red, fronted, gazelle, endangered, dama, gazelle, and, african, wild, dog, or, extinct, the, scimitar, horned, oryx, is, probably, extinct, in, the, wild, and, both, pelorovis, and, the, bubal, hartebeest, are, now, extinct, the, seasonal, wetlands, of, the, sahel, are, important, for, migratory, birds, moving, within, africa, and, on, the, african, eurasian, flyways, the, sahel, has, a, tropical, semi, arid, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, bsh, the, climate, is, typically, hot, sunny, dry, and, somewhat, windy, all, year, long, the, sahel, s, climate, is, similar, to, but, less, extreme, than, the, climate, of, the, sahara, desert, located, just, to, the, north, the, sahel, mainly, receives, a, low, to, very, low, amount, of, precipitation, annually, the, steppe, has, a, very, long, prevailing, dry, season, and, a, short, rainy, season, the, precipitation, is, also, extremely, irregular, and, varies, considerably, from, season, to, season, most, of, the, rain, usually, falls, during, four, to, six, months, in, the, middle, of, the, year, while, the, other, months, may, remain, absolutely, dry, the, interior, of, the, sahel, region, generally, receives, between, 200, mm, and, 700, mm, of, rain, yearly, a, system, of, subdivisions, often, adopted, for, the, sahelian, climate, based, on, annual, rainfall, is, as, follows, the, saharan, sahelian, climate, with, mean, annual, precipitation, between, around, 100, and, 200, mm, such, as, khartoum, sudan, the, strict, sahelian, climate, with, mean, annual, precipitation, between, around, 200, and, 700, mm, such, as, niamey, niger, and, the, sahelian, sudanese, climate, with, mean, annual, precipitation, between, around, 700, and, 900, mm, such, as, ouagadougou, burkina, faso, the, relative, humidity, in, the, steppe, is, low, to, very, low, often, between, 10, and, 25, during, the, dry, season, and, between, 25, and, 75, during, the, rainy, season, the, least, humid, places, have, a, relative, humidity, under, 35, the, sahel, is, characterized, by, constant, intense, heat, with, an, unvarying, temperature, the, sahel, rarely, experiences, cold, temperatures, during, the, hottest, period, the, average, high, temperatures, are, generally, between, 36, and, 42, c, 97, and, 108, f, and, even, more, in, the, hottest, regions, often, for, more, than, three, months, while, the, average, low, temperatures, are, around, 25, to, 31, c, 77, to, 88, f, during, the, coldest, period, the, average, high, temperatures, are, between, 27, and, 33, c, 81, and, 91, f, and, the, average, low, temperatures, are, between, 15, and, 21, c, 59, and, 70, f, everywhere, in, the, sahel, the, average, mean, temperature, is, over, 18, c, 64, f, the, sahel, has, a, high, to, very, high, sunshine, duration, year, round, between, 2, 400, hours, about, 55, of, the, daylight, hours, and, 3, 600, hours, more, than, 80, of, the, daylight, hours, the, sunshine, duration, in, the, sahel, approaches, desert, levels, and, is, comparable, to, that, in, the, arabian, desert, for, example, even, though, the, sahel, is, only, a, steppe, and, not, a, desert, the, cloud, cover, is, low, to, very, low, for, example, niamey, niger, has, 3, 082, hours, of, bright, sunshine, gao, mali, has, near, 3, 385, hours, of, sunshine, timbuktu, mali, has, 3, 409, sunny, hours, and, n, djamena, chad, has, 3, 205, hours, of, sunlight, for, hundreds, of, years, the, sahel, region, has, experienced, frequent, droughts, and, megadroughts, one, megadrought, lasted, from, 1450, to, 1700, 250, years, there, was, a, major, drought, in, the, sahel, in, 1914, caused, by, annual, rains, far, below, average, leading, to, large, scale, famine, from, 1951, to, 2004, the, sahel, experienced, some, of, the, most, consistent, and, severe, droughts, in, africa, the, 1960s, saw, a, large, increase, in, rainfall, in, the, region, making, the, northern, drier, region, more, accessible, there, was, a, push, supported, by, governments, for, people, to, move, northwards, when, the, long, drought, period, from, 1968, through, 1974, began, grazing, quickly, became, unsustainable, and, large, scale, denuding, of, the, terrain, followed, like, the, drought, in, 1914, this, led, to, a, large, scale, famine, but, this, time, somewhat, tempered, by, international, visibility, and, an, outpouring, of, aid, this, catastrophe, led, to, the, founding, of, the, international, fund, for, agricultural, development, between, june, and, august, 2010, famine, struck, the, sahel, niger, s, crops, failed, to, mature, in, the, heat, 350, 000, faced, starvation, and, 1, 200, 000, were, at, risk, of, famine, in, chad, the, temperature, reached, 47, 6, c, 117, 7, f, on, 22, june, in, faya, largeau, breaking, a, record, set, in, 1961, at, the, same, location, niger, tied, its, highest, temperature, record, set, in, 1998, also, on, 22, june, at, 47, 1, c, in, bilma, that, record, was, broken, the, next, day, when, bilma, hit, 48, 2, c, 118, 8, f, the, hottest, temperature, recorded, in, sudan, was, reached, on, 25, june, at, 49, 6, c, 121, 3, f, in, dongola, breaking, a, record, set, in, 1987, niger, reported, on, 14, july, that, diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition, and, respiratory, diseases, had, sickened, or, killed, many, children, the, new, military, junta, appealed, for, international, food, aid, and, took, serious, steps, to, call, on, overseas, help, on, 26, july, the, heat, reached, near, record, levels, over, chad, and, niger, and, in, northern, niger, about, 20, people, reportedly, died, of, dehydration, by, 27, july, the, sahel, region, faces, environmental, issues, that, are, contributing, to, global, warming, if, the, change, in, climate, in, the, sahel, region, is, not, slowed, down, and, desertification, possibly, reversed, through, sustainable, practices, and, any, form, of, reforestation, it, is, only, a, matter, of, time, before, countries, like, niger, lose, their, entire, landmass, to, desert, due, to, unchecked, unsustainable, human, practices, 9, over, farming, over, grazing, over, population, of, marginal, lands, and, natural, soil, erosion, have, caused, serious, desertification, of, the, region, this, has, affected, shelter, construction, making, it, necessary, to, change, the, used, materials, the, woodless, construction, project, was, introduced, in, sahel, in, 1980, by, the, development, workshop, achieving, since, then, a, high, social, impact, in, the, region, a, major, initiative, to, combat, desertification, in, the, sahel, region, via, reforestation, and, other, interventions, is, the, great, green, wall, major, dust, storms, are, a, frequent, occurrence, as, well, during, november, 2004, a, number, of, major, dust, storms, hit, chad, originating, in, the, bod, l, depression, this, is, a, common, area, for, dust, storms, occurring, on, average, on, 100, days, every, year, on, 23, march, 2010, a, major, sandstorm, hit, mauritania, senegal, the, gambia, guinea, bissau, guinea, and, inland, sierra, leone, another, struck, in, southern, algeria, inland, mauritania, mali, and, northern, ivory, coast, at, the, same, time, protected, areas, in, the, sahel, include, ferlo, nord, wildlife, reserve, in, senegal, sylvo, pastoral, and, partial, faunal, reserve, of, the, sahel, in, burkina, faso, ansonga, m, nake, faunal, reserve, in, mali, tadres, reserve, in, niger, and, waza, national, park, in, cameroon, traditionally, most, of, the, people, in, the, sahel, have, been, semi, nomads, farming, and, raising, livestock, in, a, system, of, transhumance, the, difference, between, the, dry, north, with, higher, levels, of, soil, nutrients, and, the, wetter, south, with, more, vegetation, is, utilized, by, having, the, herds, graze, on, high, quality, feed, in, the, north, during, the, wet, season, and, trek, several, hundred, kilometers, to, the, south, to, graze, on, more, abundant, but, less, nutritious, feed, during, the, dry, period, in, western, sahel, polygamy, and, child, marriage, are, common, female, genital, mutilation, is, also, practiced, across, the, sahel, the, term, sahel, is, borrowed, from, the, arabic, name, for, the, region, al, s, il, s, il, literally, means, coast, shore, which, has, been, explained, as, a, figurative, reference, to, the, southern, edge, of, the, vast, sahara, however, such, use, is, unattested, in, classical, arabic, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, word, may, originally, have, been, derived, from, the, arabic, word, sahl, plain, instead, around, 4000, bc, the, climate, of, the, sahara, and, the, sahel, started, to, become, drier, at, an, exceedingly, fast, pace, this, climate, change, caused, lakes, and, rivers, to, shrink, significantly, and, caused, increasing, desertification, this, in, turn, decreased, the, amount, of, land, conducive, to, settlements, and, caused, migrations, of, farming, communities, to, the, more, humid, climate, of, west, africa, the, sahelian, kingdoms, were, a, series, of, monarchies, centered, in, the, sahel, between, the, 9th, and, 18th, centuries, the, wealth, of, the, states, like, the, legendary, mali, empire, at, the, time, of, mansa, musa, came, from, controlling, the, trans, saharan, trade, routes, across, the, desert, especially, with, the, maghreb, their, power, came, from, having, large, pack, animals, like, camels, and, horses, that, were, fast, enough, to, keep, a, large, empire, under, central, control, and, were, also, useful, in, battle, all, of, these, empires, were, quite, decentralized, with, member, cities, having, a, great, deal, of, autonomy, the, larger, sahelian, kingdoms, emerged, from, 750, ad, and, erected, several, large, cities, in, the, niger, valley, region, including, timbuktu, gao, and, djenn, due, to, the, wooded, areas, to, their, south, the, sahelian, states, were, hindered, from, expanding, into, the, north, akan, state, of, the, bonoman, and, yoruba, peoples, as, mounted, warriors, were, all, but, useless, in, the, forests, in, addition, the, horses, and, camels, were, susceptible, to, the, humidity, and, diseases, of, the, tropics, the, western, sahel, fell, to, france, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, part, of, french, west, africa, chad, was, added, in, 1900, as, part, of, french, equatorial, africa, the, french, territories, in, the, sahel, were, decolonized, in, 1960, the, sahel, s, easternmost, region, did, not, fall, to, the, european, powers, but, to, the, khedivate, of, egypt, when, it, was, conquered, by, muhammad, ali, in, the, 1820s, by, 1899, it, came, under, british, rule, until, granted, independence, at, egypt, s, behest, in, 1956, according, to, the, economist, in, recent, years, the, sahel, has, become, the, epicenter, of, terrorist, violence, contributing, to, 35, of, all, global, deaths, from, terrorism, by, 2021, with, jama, at, nasr, al, islam, wal, muslimin, an, al, qaeda, affiliated, group, identified, as, the, world, s, fastest, growing, terrorist, organization, in, 2023, fatalities, from, conflict, in, the, central, sahel, rose, by, 38, according, to, data, from, the, research, organization, armed, conflict, location, and, event, data, project, in, the, wake, of, the, libyan, crisis, beginning, in, 2011, terrorist, organizations, operating, in, the, sahel, including, boko, haram, islamic, state, and, al, qaeda, in, the, islamic, maghreb, aqim, have, greatly, exacerbated, the, violence, extremism, and, instability, of, the, region, in, march, 2020, the, united, states, sent, a, special, envoy, for, the, sahel, region, to, combat, the, rising, violence, from, terrorist, groups, the, catholic, charity, aid, to, the, church, in, need, has, highlighted, the, fact, that, the, sahel, has, become, one, of, the, most, dangerous, regions, in, the, world, for, christians, as, of, 2024, a, wave, of, new, military, juntas, in, africa, favoring, russian, mercenaries, over, western, forces, and, un, peacekeepers, has, intensified, violence, this, led, mauritania, and, chad, to, disband, the, g5, sahel, an, anti, terrorism, alliance, after, the, military, regimes, in, burkina, faso, niger, and, mali, withdrew, on, 9, july, 2020, the, united, states, raised, concerns, over, growing, number, of, allegations, of, human, rights, violations, and, abuses, by, state, security, forces, in, sahel, the, us, response, came, after, human, rights, watch, released, documents, regarding, the, same, on, 1, july, reports,

ruling, in, mali, burkina, faso, niger, chad, and, sudan, the, violent, herder, farmer, conflicts, in, nigeria, mali, sudan, and, other, countries, in, the, sahel, region, have, been, exacerbated, by, climate, change, land, degradation, and, rapid, population, growth, droughts, and, food, shortages, have, been, also, linked, to, the, mali, war, the, sahel, is, experiencing, more, severe, weather, due, to, climate, change, exemplified, by, the, extreme, heatwave, of, march, april, 2024, in, burkina, faso, and, mali, this, event, intensified, by, a, 1, 2, c, global, temperature, increase, from,
