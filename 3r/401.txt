tailed, lizards, are, just, some, of, the, desert, adapted, species, that, survive, in, this, extreme, environment, which, features, everything, from, red, dunes, to, deadly, quicksand, the, climate, is, mostly, dry, the, major, part, receives, around, 100, mm, 3, 9, in, of, rain, per, year, but, some, very, rare, places, receive, as, little, as, 50, mm, and, temperatures, oscillate, between, very, high, heat, and, seasonal, night, time, freezes, it, is, part, of, the, deserts, and, xeric, shrublands, biome, and, lie, in, biogeographical, realms, of, the, palearctic, northern, part, and, afrotropical, southern, part, the, arabian, desert, ecoregion, has, little, biodiversity, although, a, few, endemic, plants, grow, here, many, species, such, as, the, striped, hyena, jackal, and, honey, badger, have, died, out, as, a, result, of, hunting, habitat, destruction, overgrazing, by, livestock, off, road, driving, and, human, encroachment, on, their, habitat, other, species, such, as, the, arabian, sand, gazelle, have, been, successfully, re, introduced, and, are, protected, at, reserves, the, desert, lies, mostly, in, saudi, arabia, and, covers, most, of, the, country, it,

sands, are, predominantly, silicates, composed, of, 80, to, 90, quartz, and, the, remainder, feldspar, whose, iron, oxide, coated, grains, color, the, sands, orange, purple, and, red, a, corridor, of, sandy, terrain, known, as, the, ad, dahna, desert, connects, the, an, nafud, desert, 65, 000, km, 2, or, 40, 389, square, miles, in, the, north, of, saudi, arabia, to, the, rub, al, khali, in, the,

areas, get, around, 100, mm, 3, 9, in, of, rain, per, year, unlike, the, sahara, desert, more, than, half, of, which, is, hyperarid, having, rainfall, of, less, than, 50, mm, 2, 0, in, per, year, the, arabian, desert, has, only, a, few, hyperarid, areas, these, rare, driest, areas, may, get, only, 30, to, 40, mm, 1, 6, in, of, rain, per, year, the, arabian, desert, s, sunshine, duration, index, is,
