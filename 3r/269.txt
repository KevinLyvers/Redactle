remains, of, homo, erectus, popularly, known, as, the, java, man, dating, back, 1, 3, million, years, were, found, along, the, banks, of, the, bengawan, solo, river, h, erectus, arrived, in, eurasia, approximately, 1, 8, million, years, ago, in, an, event, considered, to, be, the, first, african, exodus, there, is, evidence, that, the, java, population, of, h, erectus, lived, in, an, ever, wet, forest, habitat, more, specifically, the, environment, resembled, a, savannah, but, was, likely, regularly, inundated, hydromorphic, savanna, the, plants, found, at, the, trinil, excavation, site, included, grass, poaceae, ferns, ficus, and, indigofera, which, are, typical, of, lowland, rainforest, h, e, soloensis, was, the, last, population, of, a, long, occupation, history, of, the, island, of, java, by, h, erectus, beginning, 1, 51, to, 0, 93, million, years, ago, at, the, sangiran, site, continuing, 540, to, 430, thousand, years, ago, at, the, trinil, site, and, finally, 117, to, 108, thousand, years, ago, at, ngandong, if, the, date, is, correct, for, solo, man, then, they, would, represent, a, terminal, population, of, h, erectus, which, sheltered, in, the, last, open, habitat, refuges, of, east, asia, before, the, rainforest, takeover, before, the, immigration, of, modern, humans, late, pleistocene, southeast, asia, was, also, home, to, h, floresiensis, endemic, to, the, island, of, flores, indonesia, and, h, luzonensis, endemic, to, the, island, of, luzon, the, philippines, genetic, analysis, of, present, day, southeast, asian, populations, indicates, the, widespread, dispersal, of, the, denisovans, a, species, currently, recognisable, only, by, their, genetic, signature, across, southeast, asia, whereupon, they, interbred, with, immigrating, modern, humans, 45, 7, and, 29, 8, thousand, years, ago, a, 2021, genomic, study, indicates, that, aside, from, the, denisovans, modern, humans, never, interbred, with, any, of, these, endemic, human, species, unless, the, offspring, were, unviable, or, the, hybrid, lineages, have, since, died, out, judging, by, the, sheer, number, of, specimens, deposited, at, ngandong, at, the, same, time, there, may, have, been, a, sizeable, population, of, h, e, soloensis, before, the, volcanic, eruption, which, resulted, in, their, interment, but, population, is, difficult, to, approximate, with, certainty, the, ngandong, site, was, some, distance, away, from, the, northern, coast, of, the, island, but, it, is, unclear, where, the, southern, shoreline, and, the, mouth, of, the, solo, river, would, have, been, the, island, s, exceptional, fertility, and, rainfall, allowed, the, development, of, wet, field, rice, cultivation, which, required, sophisticated, levels, of, cooperation, between, villages, out, of, these, village, alliances, small, kingdoms, developed, the, chain, of, volcanic, mountains, and, associated, highlands, running, the, length, of, java, kept, its, interior, regions, and, peoples, separate, and, relatively, isolated, before, the, advent, of, islamic, states, and, european, colonialism, the, rivers, provided, the, main, means, of, communication, although, java, s, many, rivers, are, mostly, short, only, the, brantas, river, and, solo, river, could, provide, long, distance, communication, and, this, way, their, valleys, supported, the, centers, of, major, kingdoms, a, system, of, roads, permanent, bridges, and, toll, gates, is, thought, to, have, been, established, in, java, by, at, least, the, mid, 17th, century, local, powers, could, disrupt, the, routes, as, could, the, wet, season, and, road, use, was, highly, dependent, on, constant, maintenance, consequently, communication, between, java, s, population, was, difficult, the, emergence, of, civilization, on, the, island, of, java, is, often, associated, with, the, arrival, of, aji, saka, in, 78, ad, although, aji, saka, is, said, to, be, the, bearer, of, civilization, on, java, the, story, received, several, objections, and, rebuttals, from, other, historical, sources, valmiki, s, ramayana, made, around, 500, bc, records, that, java, already, had, a, governmental, organization, long, before, the, story, yawadwipa, is, decorated, with, seven, kingdoms, gold, and, silver, islands, rich, in, gold, mines, and, there, is, cicira, cold, mountain, that, touches, the, sky, with, its, peak, 6, the, greek, geographer, ptolemy, called, the, island, yabadiou, or, sabadiou, ancient, greek, or, according, to, chinese, record, m, ng, sh, the, javanese, kingdom, was, founded, in, 65, bc, or, 143, years, before, the, story, of, aji, saka, began, 39, the, story, of, aji, saka, is, a, neo, javanese, story, this, story, has, not, yet, been, found, to, be, relevant, in, the, old, javanese, text, this, story, tells, of, events, in, the, medang, kamulan, kingdom, in, java, in, the, past, at, that, time, the, king, of, medang, kamulan, prabu, dewata, cengkar, was, replaced, by, aji, saka, this, story, is, considered, as, an, allegory, of, the, entry, of, indians, into, java, referring, to, the, liang, dynasty, information, the, javanese, kingdom, was, divided, into, two, the, pre, hinduism, kingdom, and, the, post, hindu, kingdom, which, began, in, 78, ad, 5, and, 7, the, taruma, and, sunda, kingdoms, of, western, java, appeared, in, the, 4th, and, 7th, centuries, respectively, while, the, kalingga, kingdom, sent, embassies, to, china, starting, in, 640, 53, 79, however, the, first, major, principality, was, the, mataram, kingdom, that, was, founded, in, central, java, at, the, beginning, of, the, 8th, century, mataram, s, religion, centered, on, the, hindu, god, shiva, and, the, kingdom, produced, some, of, java, s, earliest, hindu, temples, on, the, dieng, plateau, around, the, 8th, century, the, sailendra, dynasty, rose, in, kedu, plain, and, become, the, patron, of, mahayana, buddhism, this, ancient, kingdom, built, monuments, such, as, the, 9th, century, borobudur, and, prambanan, in, central, java, around, the, 10th, century, the, center, of, power, shifted, from, central, to, eastern, java, the, eastern, javanese, kingdoms, of, kediri, singhasari, and, majapahit, were, mainly, dependent, on, rice, agriculture, yet, also, pursued, trade, within, the, indonesian, archipelago, and, with, china, and, india, majapahit, was, established, by, wijaya, 201, and, by, the, end, of, the, reign, of, hayam, wuruk, r, 1350, 89, it, claimed, sovereignty, over, the, entire, indonesian, archipelago, although, control, was, likely, limited, to, java, bali, and, madura, hayam, wuruk, s, prime, minister, gajah, mada, led, many, of, the, kingdom, s, territorial, conquests, 234, previous, javanese, kingdoms, had, their, power, based, on, agriculture, however, majapahit, took, control, of, ports, and, shipping, lanes, and, became, java, s, first, commercial, empire, with, the, death, of, hayam, wuruk, and, the, coming, of, islam, to, indonesia, majapahit, went, into, decline, 241, islam, became, the, dominant, religion, in, java, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, during, this, era, the, islamic, kingdoms, of, demak, cirebon, and, banten, were, ascendant, the, mataram, sultanate, became, the, dominant, power, of, central, and, eastern, java, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, principalities, of, surabaya, and, cirebon, were, eventually, subjugated, such, that, only, mataram, and, banten, were, left, to, face, the, dutch, in, the, 17th, century, java, s, contact, with, the, european, colonial, powers, began, in, 1522, with, a, treaty, between, the, sunda, kingdom, and, the, portuguese, in, malacca, after, its, failure, the, portuguese, presence, was, confined, to, malacca, and, to, the, eastern, islands, in, 1596, a, four, ship, expedition, led, by, cornelis, de, houtman, was, the, first, dutch, contact, with, indonesia, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, dutch, had, extended, their, influence, over, the, sultanates, of, the, interior, through, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, indonesia, internal, conflict, prevented, the, javanese, from, forming, effective, alliances, against, the, dutch, remnants, of, the, mataram, survived, as, the, surakarta, solo, and, yogyakarta, principalities, javanese, kings, claimed, to, rule, with, divine, authority, and, the, dutch, helped, them, to, preserve, remnants, of, a, javanese, aristocracy, by, confirming, them, as, regents, or, district, officials, within, the, colonial, administration, java, s, major, role, during, the, early, part, of, the, colonial, period, was, as, a, producer, of, rice, in, spice, producing, islands, like, banda, rice, was, regularly, imported, from, java, to, supply, the, deficiency, in, means, of, subsistence, during, the, napoleonic, wars, in, europe, the, netherlands, fell, to, france, as, did, its, colony, in, the, east, indies, during, the, short, lived, daendels, administration, as, french, proxy, rule, on, java, the, construction, of, the, great, post, road, was, commenced, in, 1808, the, road, spanning, from, anyer, in, western, java, to, panarukan, in, east, java, served, as, a, military, supply, route, and, was, used, in, defending, java, from, british, invasion, in, 1811, java, was, captured, by, the, british, becoming, a, possession, of, the, british, empire, and, sir, stamford, raffles, was, appointed, as, the, island, s, governor, in, 1816, under, the, governorship, of, john, fendall, java, was, returned, to, the, dutch, as, per, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1815, there, may, have, been, five, million, people, in, java, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, population, spurts, began, in, districts, along, the, north, central, coast, of, java, and, in, the, 19th, century, population, grew, rapidly, across, the, island, factors, for, the, great, population, growth, include, the, impact, of, dutch, colonial, rule, including, the, imposed, end, to, civil, war, in, java, the, increase, in, the, area, under, rice, cultivation, and, the, introduction, of, food, plants, such, as, cassava, and, maize, that, could, sustain, populations, that, could, not, afford, rice, others, attribute, the, growth, to, the, taxation, burdens, and, increased, expansion, of, employment, under, the, cultivation, system, to, which, couples, responded, by, having, more, children, in, the, hope, of, increasing, their, families, ability, to, pay, tax, and, buy, goods, cholera, claimed, 100, 000, lives, in, java, in, 1820, the, advent, of, trucks, and, railways, where, there, had, previously, only, been, buffalo, and, carts, telegraph, systems, and, more, coordinated, distribution, systems, under, the, colonial, government, all, contributed, to, famine, elimination, in, java, and, in, turn, population, growth, there, were, no, significant, famines, in, java, from, the, 1840s, through, to, the, japanese, occupation, in, the, 1940s, however, other, sources, claimed, the, dutch, s, cultivation, system, is, linked, to, famines, and, epidemics, in, the, 1840s, firstly, in, cirebon, and, then, central, java, as, cash, crops, such, as, indigo, and, sugar, had, to, be, grown, instead, of, rice, indonesian, nationalism, first, took, hold, in, java, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, the, struggle, to, secure, the, country, s, independence, following, world, war, ii, was, centered, in, java, in, 1949, indonesian, independence, was, recognized, java, is, divided, into, four, provinces, and, two, special, regions, 1, including, all, within, sumenep, regency, the, neighbouring, small, archipelagos, of, the, kangean, islands, 648, 55, km, 2, the, sapudi, islands, 167, 41, km, 2, talango, island, 50, 278, km, 2, masalembu, 40, 85, km, 2, and, the, giligenteng, islands, 30, 32, km, 2, 2, other, offshore, islands, are, included, in, this, figure, but, are, comparatively, very, small, in, population, and, area, they, include, nusa, barong, 100, km, 2, bawean, 196, km, 2, karimunjawa, 78, km, 2, nusa, kambangan, 121, km, 2, panaitan, 170, km, 2, and, the, thousand, islands, 8, 7, km, 2, with, a, combined, population, of, roughly, 90, 000, 3, land, area, of, provinces, updated, in, mid, 2023, regency, city, annual, statistics, java, has, been, traditionally, dominated, by, an, elite, class, while, the, people, in, the, lower, classes, were, often, involved, in, agriculture, and, fishing, the, elite, class, in, java, has, evolved, over, the, course, of, history, as, cultural, wave, after, cultural, wave, immigrated, to, the, island, there, is, evidence, that, south, asian, emigres, were, among, this, elite, as, well, as, arabian, and, persian, immigrants, during, the, islamic, eras, more, recently, chinese, immigrants, have, also, become, part, of, the, economic, elite, of, java, although, politically, the, chinese, generally, remain, sidelined, there, are, notable, exceptions, such, as, the, former, governor, of, jakarta, basuki, tjahaja, purnama, though, java, is, increasingly, becoming, more, modern, and, urban, only, 75, of, the, island, has, electricity, villages, and, their, rice, paddies, are, still, a, common, sight, unlike, the, rest, of, java, the, population, growth, in, central, java, remains, low, central, java, however, has, a, younger, population, than, the, national, average, the, slow, population, growth, can, in, part, be, attributed, to, the, choice, by, many, people, to, leave, the, more, rural, central, java, for, better, opportunities, and, higher, incomes, in, the, bigger, cities, java, s, population, continues, to, rapidly, increase, despite, many, javanese, leaving, the, island, this, is, somewhat, due, to, the, fact, that, java, is, the, business, academic, and, cultural, hub, of, indonesia, which, attracts, millions, of, non, javanese, people, to, its, cities, the, population, growth, is, most, intense, in, the, regions, surrounding, jakarta, and,
