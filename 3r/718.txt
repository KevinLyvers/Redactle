for, british, products, and, a, source, of, revenue, and, raw, materials, with, the, appropriate, infrastructure, in, place, the, british, hoped, to, utilise, sindh, for, its, economic, potential, the, british, incorporated, sindh, some, years, later, after, annexing, it, into, the, bombay, presidency, distance, from, the, provincial, capital, bombay, led, to, grievances, that, sindh, was, neglected, in, contrast, to, other, parts, of, the, presidency, the, merger, of, sindh, into, punjab, province, was, considered, from, time, to, time, but, was, turned, down, because, of, british, disagreement, and, sindhi, opposition, both, from, muslims, and, hindus, to, being, annexed, to, punjab, later, desire, for, a, separate, administrative, status, for, sindh, grew, at, the, annual, session, of, the, indian, national, congress, in, 1913, a, sindhi, hindu, put, forward, the, demand, for, sindh, s, separation, from, the, bombay, presidency, on, the, grounds, of, sindh, s, unique, cultural, character, this, reflected, the, desire, of, sindh, s, predominantly, hindu, commercial, class, to, free, itself, from, competing, with, the, more, powerful, bombay, s, business, interests, meanwhile, sindhi, politics, was, characterised, in, the, 1920s, by, the, growing, importance, of, karachi, and, the, khilafat, movement, a, number, of, sindhi, pirs, descendants, of, sufi, saints, who, had, proselytised, in, sindh, joined, the, khilafat, movement, which, propagated, the, protection, of, the, ottoman, caliphate, and, those, pirs, who, did, not, join, the, movement, found, a, decline, in, their, following, the, pirs, generated, huge, support, for, the, khilafat, cause, in, sindh, sindh, came, to, be, at, the, forefront, of, the, khilafat, movement, although, sindh, had, a, cleaner, record, of, communal, harmony, than, other, parts, of, india, the, province, s, muslim, elite, and, emerging, muslim, middle, class, demanded, separation, of, sindh, from, bombay, presidency, as, a, safeguard, for, their, own, interests, in, this, campaign, local, sindhi, muslims, identified, hindu, with, bombay, instead, of, sindh, sindhi, hindus, were, seen, as, representing, the, interests, of, bombay, instead, of, the, majority, of, sindhi, muslims, sindhi, hindus, for, the, most, part, opposed, the, separation, of, sindh, from, bombay, although, sindh, had, a, culture, of, religious, syncretism, communal, harmony, and, tolerance, due, to, sindh, s, strong, sufi, culture, in, which, both, sindhi, muslims, and, sindhi, hindus, partook, both, the, muslim, landed, elite, waderas, and, the, hindu, commercial, elements, banias, collaborated, in, oppressing, the, predominantly, muslim, peasantry, of, sindh, who, were, economically, exploited, sindhi, muslims, eventually, demanded, the, separation, of, sindh, from, the, bombay, presidency, a, move, opposed, by, sindhi, hindus, in, sindh, s, first, provincial, election, after, its, separation, from, bombay, in, 1936, economic, interests, were, an, essential, factor, of, politics, informed, by, religious, and, cultural, issues, due, to, british, policies, much, land, in, sindh, was, transferred, from, muslim, to, hindu, hands, over, the, decades, religious, tensions, rose, in, sindh, over, the, sukkur, manzilgah, issue, where, muslims, and, hindus, disputed, over, an, abandoned, mosque, in, proximity, to, an, area, sacred, to, hindus, the, sindh, muslim, league, exploited, the, issue, and, agitated, for, the, return, of, the, mosque, to, muslims, consequentially, a, thousand, members, of, the, muslim, league, were, imprisoned, eventually, due, to, panic, the, government, restored, the, mosque, to, muslims, the, separation, of, sindh, from, bombay, presidency, triggered, sindhi, muslim, nationalists, to, support, the, pakistan, movement, even, while, the, punjab, and, north, west, frontier, province, were, ruled, by, parties, hostile, to, the, muslim, league, sindh, remained, loyal, to, jinnah, although, the, prominent, sindhi, muslim, nationalist, g, m, syed, left, the, all, india, muslim, league, in, the, mid, 1940s, and, his, relationship, with, jinnah, never, improved, the, overwhelming, majority, of, sindhi, muslims, supported, the, creation, of, pakistan, seeing, in, it, their, deliverance, sindhi, support, for, the, pakistan, movement, arose, from, the, desire, of, the, sindhi, muslim, business, class, to, drive, out, their, hindu, competitors, the, muslim, league, s, rise, to, becoming, the, party, with, the, strongest, support, in, sindh, was, in, large, part, linked, to, its, winning, over, of, the, religious, pir, families, although, the, muslim, league, had, previously, fared, poorly, in, the, 1937, elections, in, sindh, when, local, sindhi, muslim, parties, won, more, seats, the, muslim, league, s, cultivation, of, support, from, local, pirs, in, 1946, helped, it, gain, a, foothold, in, the, province, it, didn, t, take, long, for, the, overwhelming, majority, of, sindhi, muslims, to, campaign, for, the, creation, of, pakistan, in, 1947, violence, did, not, constitute, a, major, part, of, the, sindhi, partition, experience, unlike, in, punjab, there, were, very, few, incidents, of, violence, on, sindh, in, part, due, to, the, sufi, influenced, culture, of, religious, tolerance, and, in, part, that, sindh, was, not, divided, and, was, instead, made, part, of, pakistan, in, its, entirety, sindhi, hindus, who, left, generally, did, so, out, of, a, fear, of, persecution, rather, than, persecution, itself, because, of, the, arrival, of, muslim, refugees, from, india, sindhi, hindus, differentiated, between, the, local, sindhi, muslims, and, the, migrant, muslims, from, india, a, large, number, of, sindhi, hindus, travelled, to, india, by, sea, to, the, ports, of, bombay, porbandar, veraval, and, okha, sindh, has, the, second, highest, human, development, index, out, of, all, of, pakistan, s, provinces, at, 0,

capture, of, sindh, by, muhammad, bin, qasim, in, 712, ce, over, time, the, majority, of, the, population, in, sindh, converted, to, islam, especially, in, rural, areas, today, muslims, make, up, 90, of, the, population, and, are, more, dominant, in, urban, than, rural, areas, islam, in, sindh, has, a, strong, sufi, ethos, with, numerous, muslim, saints, and, mystics, such, as, the, sufi, poet, shah, abdul, latif, bhittai, having, lived, in, sindh, historically, one, popular, legend, which, highlights, the, strong, sufi, presence, in, sindh, is, that, 125, 000, sufi, saints, and, mystics, are, buried, on, makli, hill, near, thatta, the, development, of, sufism, in, sindh, was, similar, to, the, development, of, sufism, in, other, parts, of, the, muslim, world, in, the, 16th, century, two, sufi, tareeqat, orders, qadria, and, naqshbandia, were, introduced, in, sindh, sufism, continues, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, daily, lives, of, sindhis, in, 1941, the, last, census,
