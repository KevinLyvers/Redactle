the, continent, of, australia, sometimes, known, in, technical, contexts, by, the, names, sahul, s, h, u, l, australia, new, guinea, australinea, or, meganesia, to, distinguish, it, from, the, country, of, australia, is, located, within, the, southern, and, eastern, hemispheres, the, continent, includes, mainland, australia, tasmania, the, island, of, new, guinea, papua, new, guinea, and, western, new, guinea, the, aru, islands, the, ashmore, and, cartier, islands, most, of, the, coral, sea, islands, and, some, other, nearby, islands, situated, in, the, geographical, region, of, oceania, australia, is, the, smallest, of, the, seven, traditional, continents, the, continent, includes, a, continental, shelf, overlain, by, shallow, seas, which, divide, it, into, several, landmasses, the, arafura, sea, and, torres, strait, between, mainland, australia, and, new, guinea, and, bass, strait, between, mainland, australia, and, tasmania, when, sea, levels, were, lower, during, the, pleistocene, ice, age, including, the, last, glacial, maximum, about, 18, 000, bc, they, were, connected, by, dry, land, into, the, combined, landmass, of, sahul, the, name, sahul, derives, from, the, sahul, shelf, which, is, a, part, of, the, continental, shelf, of, the, australian, continent, during, the, past, 18, 000, to, 10, 000, years, rising, sea, levels, overflowed, the, lowlands, and, separated, the, continent, into, today, s, low, lying, arid, to, semi, arid, mainland, and, the, two, mountainous, islands, of, new, guinea, and, tasmania, with, a, total, land, area, of, 8, 56, million, square, kilometres, 3, 310, 000, sq, mi, the, australian, continent, is, the, smallest, lowest, flattest, and, second, driest, continent, after, antarctica, on, earth, as, the, country, of, australia, is, mostly, on, a, single, landmass, and, comprises, most, of, the, continent, it, is, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, an, island, continent, surrounded, by, oceans, papua, new, guinea, a, country, within, the, continent, is, one, of, the, most, culturally, and, linguistically, diverse, countries, in, the, world, it, is, also, one, of, the, most, rural, as, only, 18, percent, of, its, people, live, in, urban, centres, west, papua, a, region, in, indonesia, is, home, to, an, estimated, 44, uncontacted, tribal, groups, australia, the, largest, landmass, in, the, continent, is, highly, urbanised, and, has, the, world, s, 14th, largest, economy, with, the, second, highest, human, development, index, globally, australia, also, has, the, world, s, 9th, largest, immigrant, population, the, continent, of, australia, is, sometimes, known, by, the, names, sahul, australinea, or, meganesia, to, differentiate, it, from, the, country, of, australia, and, consists, of, the, landmasses, which, sit, on, australia, s, continental, plate, this, includes, mainland, australia, tasmania, and, the, island, of, new, guinea, which, comprises, papua, new, guinea, and, western, new, guinea, papua, and, west, papua, provinces, of, indonesia, the, name, sahul, takes, its, name, from, the, sahul, shelf, which, is, part, of, the, continental, shelf, of, the, australian, continent, the, term, oceania, originally, a, great, division, of, the, world, in, the, 1810s, was, replaced, in, english, language, countries, by, the, concept, of, australia, as, one, of, the, world, s, continents, in, the, 1950s, prior, to, the, 1950s, before, the, popularization, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, antarctica, australia, and, greenland, were, sometimes, described, as, island, continents, but, none, were, usually, taught, as, one, of, the, world, s, continents, in, english, speaking, countries, scottish, cartographer, john, bartholomew, wrote, in, 1873, that, the, new, world, consists, of, north, america, and, the, peninsula, of, south, america, attached, to, it, these, divisions, generally, themselves, spoken, as, continents, and, to, them, has, been, added, another, embracing, the, large, island, of, australia, and, numerous, others, in, the, ocean, under, the, name, of, oceania, there, are, thus, six, great, divisions, of, the, earth, europe, asia, africa, north, america, south, america, and, oceania, the, american, author, samuel, griswold, goodrich, wrote, in, his, 1854, book, history, of, all, nations, that, geographers, have, agreed, to, consider, the, island, world, of, the, pacific, ocean, as, a, third, continent, under, the, name, oceania, in, this, book, the, other, two, continents, were, categorized, as, being, the, new, world, consisting, of, north, america, and, south, america, and, the, old, world, consisting, of, africa, asia, and, europe, in, his, 1879, book, australasia, british, naturalist, alfred, russel, wallace, commented, that, oceania, is, the, word, often, used, by, continental, geographers, to, describe, the, great, world, of, islands, we, are, now, entering, upon, and, that, australia, forms, its, central, and, most, important, feature, he, did, not, explicitly, label, oceania, a, continent, in, the, book, but, did, note, that, it, was, one, of, the, six, major, divisions, of, the, world, he, considered, it, to, encompass, the, insular, pacific, area, between, asia, and, the, americas, and, claimed, it, extended, up, to, the, aleutian, islands, which, are, among, the, northernmost, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, however, definitions, of, oceania, varied, during, the, 19th, century, in, the, 19th, century, many, geographers, divided, up, oceania, into, mostly, racially, based, subdivisions, australasia, malaysia, encompassing, malay, archipelago, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, today, the, malay, archipelago, is, typically, considered, part, of, southeast, asia, and, the, term, oceania, is, often, used, to, denote, the, region, encompassing, the, australian, continent, zealandia, and, various, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, that, are, not, included, in, the, seven, continent, model, it, has, been, recognized, by, the, united, nations, as, one, of, the, world, s, five, major, continental, divisions, since, its, foundation, in, 1947, along, with, africa, asia, europe, and, the, americas, the, un, s, definition, of, oceania, utilizes, four, of, the, five, subregions, from, the, 19th, century, australasia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, they, include, american, samoa, australia, and, their, external, territories, the, cook, islands, easter, island, chile, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, french, polynesia, fiji, galapagos, islands, ecuador, guam, kiribati, the, marshall, islands, nauru, new, caledonia, new, zealand, niue, the, northern, mariana, islands, ogasawara, japan, palau, papua, new, guinea, pitcairn, islands, samoa, the, solomon, islands, tokelau, tonga, tuvalu, vanuatu, wallis, and, futuna, western, new, guinea, and, the, united, states, minor, outlying, islands, baker, island, howland, island, jarvis, island, midway, atoll, palmyra, atoll, and, wake, island, as, well, as, hawaii, one, of, 50, states, of, united, states, the, original, un, definition, of, oceania, from, 1947, included, these, same, countries, and, semi, independent, territories, which, were, mostly, still, colonies, at, that, point, the, island, states, of, indonesia, japan, the, philippines, singapore, and, taiwan, all, located, within, the, bounds, of, the, pacific, or, associated, marginal, seas, are, excluded, from, the, un, definition, the, states, of, hong, kong, and, malaysia, located, in, both, mainland, asia, and, marginal, seas, of, the, pacific, are, also, excluded, as, is, the, nation, of, brunei, which, shares, the, island, of, borneo, with, indonesia, and, malaysia, further, excluded, are, east, timor, and, indonesian, or, western, new, guinea, areas, which, are, biogeographically, or, geologically, associated, with, the, australian, landmass, this, definition, of, oceania, is, used, in, statistical, reports, by, the, international, olympic, committee, and, by, many, atlases, the, cia, world, factbook, also, categorize, oceania, or, the, pacific, area, as, one, of, the, world, s, major, continental, divisions, but, use, the, term, australia, and, oceania, to, refer, to, the, area, their, definition, does, not, include, australia, s, subantarctic, external, territory, heard, island, and, mcdonald, islands, but, is, otherwise, the, same, as, the, un, definition, and, it, is, also, used, for, statistical, purposes, in, countries, such, as, argentina, brazil, china, chile, costa, rica, ecuador, france, greece, italy, mexico, the, netherlands, peru, spain, switzerland, or, venezuela, oceania, is, treated, as, a, continent, in, the, sense, that, it, is, one, of, the, parts, of, the, world, and, australia, is, only, seen, as, an, island, nation, in, other, countries, including, kazakhstan, poland, and, russia, australia, and, eurasia, are, thought, of, as, continents, while, asia, europe, and, oceania, are, regarded, as, parts, of, the, world, in, the, pacific, ocean, handbook, 1945, author, eliot, grinnell, mears, wrote, that, he, categorized, australia, new, zealand, and, pacific, islands, under, the, label, of, oceania, for, scientific, reasons, australia, s, fauna, is, largely, continental, in, character, new, zealand, s, are, clearly, insular, and, neither, commonwealth, realm, has, close, ties, with, asia, he, further, added, that, the, term, australasia, is, not, relished, by, new, zealanders, and, this, name, is, too, often, confused, with, australia, some, 19th, century, definitions, of, oceania, grouped, australia, new, zealand, and, the, islands, of, melanesia, together, under, the, label, of, australasia, in, other, 19th, century, definitions, of, oceania, the, term, was, only, used, to, refer, to, australia, itself, with, new, zealand, being, categorized, with, the, islands, of, polynesia, in, such, definitions, archaeological, terminology, for, this, region, has, changed, repeatedly, before, the, 1970s, the, single, pleistocene, landmass, was, called, australasia, derived, from, the, latin, australis, meaning, southern, although, this, word, is, most, often, used, for, a, wider, region, that, includes, lands, like, new, zealand, that, are, not, on, the, same, continental, shelf, in, the, early, 1970s, the, term, greater, australia, was, introduced, for, the, pleistocene, continent, then, at, a, 1975, conference, and, consequent, publication, the, name, sahul, was, extended, from, its, previous, use, for, just, the, sahul, shelf, to, cover, the, continent, in, 1984, w, filewood, suggested, the, name, meganesia, meaning, great, island, or, great, island, group, for, both, the, pleistocene, continent, and, the, present, day, lands, and, this, name, has, been, widely, accepted, by, biologists, others, have, used, meganesia, with, different, meanings, travel, writer, paul, theroux, included, new, zealand, in, his, definition, and, others, have, used, it, for, australia, new, zealand, and, hawaii, another, biologist, richard, dawkins, coined, the, name, australinea, in, 2004, australia, new, guinea, has, also, been, used, the, australian, continent, as, a, whole, being, part, of, the, australian, plate, is, the, lowest, flattest, and, oldest, landmass, on, earth, and, it, has, had, a, relatively, stable, geological, history, new, zealand, is, not, part, of, the, continent, of, australia, but, of, the, separate, submerged, continent, of, zealandia, new, zealand, and, australia, are, both, part, of, the, oceanian, sub, region, known, as, australasia, with, new, guinea, being, in, melanesia, the, continent, includes, a, continental, shelf, overlain, by, shallow, seas, which, divide, it, into, several, landmasses, the, arafura, sea, and, torres, strait, between, mainland, australia, and, new, guinea, and, bass, strait, between, mainland, australia, and, tasmania, when, sea, levels, were, lower, during, the, pleistocene, ice, age, including, the, last, glacial, maximum, about, 18, 000, bc, they, were, connected, by, dry, land, during, the, past, 18, 000, to, 10, 000, years, rising, sea, levels, overflowed, the, lowlands, and, separated, the, continent, into, today, s, low, lying, arid, to, semi, arid, mainland, and, the, two, mountainous, islands, of, new, guinea, and, tasmania, the, continental, shelf, connecting, the, islands, half, of, which, is, less, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, deep, covers, some, 2, 5, million, square, kilometres, 970, 000, sq, mi, including, the, sahul, shelf, and, bass, strait, geological, forces, such, as, tectonic, uplift, of, mountain, ranges, or, clashes, between, tectonic, plates, occurred, mainly, in, australia, s, early, history, when, it, was, still, a, part, of, gondwana, australia, is, situated, in, the, middle, of, the, tectonic, plate, and, therefore, currently, has, no, active, volcanism, the, continent, primarily, sits, on, the, indo, australian, plate, because, of, its, central, location, on, its, tectonic, plate, australia, does, not, have, any, active, volcanic, regions, the, only, continent, with, this, distinction, the, lands, were, joined, with, antarctica, as, part, of, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, until, the, plate, began, to, drift, north, about, 96, million, years, ago, for, most, of, the, time, since, then, australia, new, guinea, remained, a, continuous, landmass, when, the, last, glacial, period, ended, in, about, 10, 000, bc, rising, sea, levels, formed, bass, strait, separating, tasmania, from, the, mainland, then, between, about, 8, 000, and, 6, 500, bc, the, lowlands, in, the, north, were, flooded, by, the, sea, separating, the, aru, islands, mainland, australia, new, guinea, and, tasmania, a, northern, arc, consisting, of, the, new, guinea, highlands, the, raja, ampat, islands, and, halmahera, was, uplifted, by, the, northward, migration, of, australia, and, subduction, of, the, pacific, plate, the, outer, banda, arc, was, accreted, along, the, northwestern, edge, the, continent, it, includes, the, islands, of, timor, tanimbar, and, seram, papua, new, guinea, has, several, volcanoes, as, it, is, situated, along, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, volcanic, eruptions, are, not, rare, and, the, area, is, prone, to, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, because, of, this, mount, wilhelm, in, papua, new, guinea, is, the, second, highest, mountain, in, the, continent, and, at, 4, 884, metres, 16, 024, ft, above, sea, level, puncak, jaya, is, the, highest, mountain, the, australian, continent, and, sunda, were, points, of, early, human, migrations, after, leaving, africa, recent, research, points, to, a, planned, migration, of, hundreds, of, people, using, bamboo, rafts, which, eventually, landed, on, sahul, indigenous, australians, that, is, aboriginal, australians, and, torres, strait, islanders, people, are, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, australian, continent, and, nearby, islands, they, migrated, from, africa, to, asia, around, 70, 000, years, ago, and, arrived, in, australia, at, least, 50, 000, years, ago, based, on, archaeological, evidence, more, recent, research, points, to, earlier, arrival, possibly, 65, 000, years, ago, they, are, believed, to, be, among, the, earliest, human, migrations, out, of, africa, there, is, evidence, of, genetic, and, linguistic, interchange, between, australians, in, the, far, north, and, the, austronesian, peoples, of, modern, day, new, guinea, and, the, islands, but, this, may, be, the, result, of, recent, trade, and, intermarriage, the, earliest, known, human, remains, were, found, at, lake, mungo, a, dry, lake, in, the, southwest, of, new, south, wales, remains, found, at, mungo, suggest, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, cremations, thus, indicating, early, evidence, for, religious, ritual, among, humans, dreamtime, remains, a, prominent, feature, of, australian, aboriginal, art, the, oldest, continuing, tradition, of, art, in, the, world, papuan, habitation, is, estimated, to, have, begun, between, 42, 000, and, 48, 000, years, ago, in, new, guinea, trade, between, new, guinea, and, neighboring, indonesian, islands, was, documented, as, early, as, the, seventh, century, and, archipelagic, rule, of, new, guinea, by, the, 13th, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventh, century, the, sumatra, based, empire, of, srivijaya, 7th, century, 13th, century, engaged, in, trade, relations, with, western, new, guinea, initially, taking, items, like, sandalwood, and, birds, of, paradise, in, tribute, to, china, but, later, making, slaves, out, of, the, natives, the, rule, of, the, java, based, empire, of, majapahit, 1293, 1527, extended, to, the, western, fringes, of, new, guinea, recent, archaeological, research, suggests, that, 50, 000, years, ago, people, may, have, occupied, sites, in, the, highlands, at, new, guinean, altitudes, of, up, to, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, rather, than, being, restricted, to, warmer, coastal, areas, legends, of, terra, australis, incognita, an, unknown, land, of, the, south, date, back, to, roman, times, and, before, and, were, commonplace, in, medieval, geography, although, not, based, on, any, documented, knowledge, of, the, continent, ancient, greek, philosopher, aristotle, speculated, of, a, large, landmass, in, the, southern, hemisphere, saying, now, since, there, must, be, a, region, bearing, the, same, relation, to, the, southern, pole, as, the, place, we, live, in, bears, to, our, pole, his, ideas, were, later, expanded, by, ptolemy, 2nd, century, ad, who, believed, that, the, lands, of, the, northern, hemisphere, should, be, balanced, by, land, in, the, south, the, theory, of, balancing, land, has, been, documented, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, on, maps, by, macrobius, who, uses, the, term, australis, on, his, maps, terra, australis, a, hypothetical, continent, first, posited, in, antiquity, appeared, on, maps, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, scientists, such, as, gerardus, mercator, 1569, and, alexander, dalrymple, as, late, as, 1767, argued, for, its, existence, with, such, arguments, as, that, there, should, be, a, large, landmass, in, the, south, as, a, counterweight, to, the, known, landmasses, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, cartographic, depictions, of, the, southern, continent, in, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, as, might, be, expected, for, a, concept, based, on, such, abundant, conjecture, and, minimal, data, varied, wildly, from, map, to, map, in, general, the, continent, shrank, as, potential, locations, were, reinterpreted, at, its, largest, the, continent, included, tierra, del, fuego, separated, from, south, america, by, a, small, strait, new, guinea, and, what, would, come, to, be, called, australia, in, 1606, dutch, navigator, willem, janszoon, made, the, first, documented, european, sight, and, landing, on, the, continent, of, australia, in, cape, york, peninsula, dutch, explorer, abel, janszoon, tasman, circumnavigated, and, landed, on, parts, of, the, australian, continental, coast, and, discovered, van, diemen, s, land, now, tasmania, new, zealand, in, 1642, and, fiji, islands, he, was, the, first, known, european, explorer, to, reach, these, islands, in, the, quest, for, terra, australis, spanish, explorations, in, the, 17th, century, such, as, the, expedition, led, by, the, portuguese, navigator, pedro, fernandes, de, queir, s, discovered, the, pitcairn, and, vanuatu, archipelagos, and, sailed, the, torres, strait, between, australia, and, new, guinea, named, after, navigator, lu, s, vaz, de, torres, who, was, the, first, european, to, explore, the, strait, when, europeans, first, arrived, inhabitants, of, new, guinea, and, nearby, islands, whose, technologies, included, bone, wood, and, stone, tools, had, a, productive, agricultural, system, in, 1660, the, dutch, recognised, the, sultan, of, tidore, s, sovereignty, over, new, guinea, the, first, known, europeans, to, sight, new, guinea, were, probably,

recorded, direct, observation, of, indigenous, australians, at, brush, island, near, bawley, point, on, 29, april, cook, and, crew, made, their, first, landfall, on, the, mainland, of, the, continent, at, a, place, now, known, as, the, kurnell, peninsula, it, is, here, that, james, cook, made, first, contact, with, an, aboriginal, tribe, known, as, the, gweagal, who, he, fired, upon, injuring, one,

850, convicts, into, sydney, on, 26, january, 1788, this, was, to, be, the, location, for, the, new, colony, phillip, described, sydney, cove, as, being, without, exception, the, finest, harbour, in, the, world, in, 1883, the, colony, of, queensland, tried, to, annex, the, southern, half, of, eastern, new, guinea, but, the, british, government, did, not, approve, the, commonwealth, of, australia, came, into, being, when, the, federal, constitution, was, proclaimed, by, the, governor, general, lord, hopetoun, on, 1, january, 1901, from, that, point, a, system, of, federalism, in, australia, came, into, operation, entailing, the, establishment, of, an, entirely, new, national, government, the, commonwealth, government, and, an, ongoing, division, of, powers, between, that, government, and, the, states, with, the, encouragement, of, queensland, in, 1884, a, british, protectorate, had, been, proclaimed, over, the, southern, coast, of, new, guinea, and, its, adjacent, islands, british, new, guinea, was, annexed, outright, in, 1888, the, possession, was, placed, under, the, authority, of, the, newly, federated, commonwealth, of, australia, in, 1902, and, with, passage, of, the, papua, act, of, 1905, british, new, guinea, became, the, australian, territory, of, papua, with, formal, australian, administration, beginning, in, 1906, the, bombing, of, darwin, on, 19, february, 1942, was, the, largest, single, attack, ever, mounted, by, a, foreign, power, on, australia, in, an, effort, to, isolate, australia, the, japanese, planned, a, seaborne, invasion, of, port, moresby, in, the, australian, territory, of, new, guinea, between, july, and, november, 1942, australian, forces, repulsed, japanese, attempts, on, the, city, by, way, of, the, kokoda, track, in, the, highlands, of, new, guinea, the, battle, of, buna, gona, between, november, 1942, and, january, 1943, set, the, tone, for, the, bitter, final, stages, of, the, new, guinea, campaign, which, persisted, into, 1945, the, offensives, in, papua, and, new, guinea, of, 1943, 44, were, the, single, largest, series, of, connected, operations, ever, mounted, by, the, australian, armed, forces, following, the, 1998, commencement, of, reforms, across, indonesia, papua, and, other, indonesian, provinces, received, greater, regional, autonomy, in, 2001, special, autonomy, status, was, granted, to, papua, province, although, to, date, implementation, has, been, partial, and, often, criticised, the, region, was, administered, as, a, single, province, until, 2003, when, it, was, split, into, the, provinces, of, papua, and, west, papua, elections, in, 1972, resulted, in, the, formation, of, a, ministry, headed, by, chief, minister, michael, somare, who, pledged, to, lead, the, country, to, self, government, and, then, to, independence, papua, new, guinea, became, self, governing, on, 1, december, 1973, and, achieved, independence, on, 16, september, 1975, the, country, joined, the, united, nations, un, on, 10, october, 1975, migration, brought, large, numbers, of, southern, and, central, europeans, to, australia, for, the, first, time, a, 1958, government, leaflet, assured, readers, that, unskilled, non, british, migrants, were, needed, for, labour, on, rugged, projects, work, which, is, not, generally, acceptable, to, australians, or, british, workers, australia, fought, on, the, side, of, britain, in, the, two, world, wars, and, became, a, long, standing, ally, of, the, united, states, when, threatened, by, imperial, japan, during, world, war, ii, trade, with, asia, increased, and, a, post, war, immigration, program, received, more, than, 6, 5, million, migrants, from, every, continent, supported, by, immigration, of, people, from, more, than, 200, countries, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, population, increased, to, more, than, 23, million, by, 2014, for, about, 40, million, years, australia, new, guinea, was, almost, completely, isolated, during, this, time, the, continent, experienced, numerous, changes, in, climate, but, the, overall, trend, was, towards, greater, aridity, when, south, america, eventually, separated, from, antarctica, the, development, of, the, cold, antarctic, circumpolar, current, changed, weather, patterns, across, the, world, for, australia, new, guinea, it, brought, a, marked, intensification, of,

sclerophyllous, plants, that, characterise, the, modern, australian, landscape, typical, southern, hemisphere, flora, include, the, conifers, podocarpus, eastern, australia, and, new, guinea, the, rainforest, emergents, araucaria, eastern, australia, and, new, guinea, nothofagus, new, guinea, and, tasmania, and, agathis, northern, queensland, and, new, guinea, as, well, as, tree, ferns, and, several, species, of, eucalyptus, prominent, features, of, the, australian, flora, are, adaptations, to, aridity, and, fire, which, include, scleromorphy, and, serotiny, these, adaptations, are, common, in, species, from, the, large, and, well, known, families, proteaceae, banksias, and, grevilleas, myrtaceae, eucalyptus, or, gum, trees, melaleucas, and, callistemons, fabaceae, acacia, s, or, wattles, and, casuarinaceae, casuarinas, or, she, oaks, which, are, typically, found, in, the, australian, mainland, the, flora, of, new, guinea, is, a, mixture, of, many, tropical, rainforest, species, with, origins, in, asia, such, as, castanopsis, acuminatissima, lithocarpus, spp, elaeocarps, and, laurels, together, with, typically, australasian, flora, in, the, new, guinean, highlands, conifers, such, as, dacrycarpus, dacrydium, papuacedrus, and, libocedrus, are, present, for, many, species, the, primary, refuge, was, the, relatively, cool, and, well, watered, great, dividing, range, even, today, pockets, of, remnant, vegetation, remain, in, the, cool, uplands, some, species, not, much, changed, from, the, gondwanan, forms, of, 60, or, 90, million, years, ago, eventually, the, australia, new, guinea, tectonic, plate, collided, with, the, eurasian, plate, to, the, north, the, collision, caused, the, northern, part, of, the, continent, to, buckle, upwards, forming, the, high, and, rugged, mountains, of, new, guinea, and, by, reverse, downwards, buckling, the, torres, strait, that, now, separates, the, two, main, landmasses, the, collision, also, pushed, up, the, islands, of, wallacea, which, served, as, island, stepping, stones, that, allowed, plants, from, southeast, asia, s, rainforests, to, colonise, new, guinea, and, some, plants, from, australia, new, guinea, to, move, into, southeast, asia, the, ocean, straits, between, the, islands, were, narrow, enough, to, allow, plant, dispersal, but, served, as, an, effective, barrier, to, exchange, of, land, mammals, between, australia, new, guinea, and, asia, among, the, fungi, the, remarkable, association, between, cyttaria, gunnii, one, of, the, golf, ball, fungi, and, its, associated, trees, in, the, genus, nothofagus, is, evidence, of, that, drift, the, only, other, places, where, this, association, is, known, are, new, zealand, and, southern, argentina, and, chile, due, to, the, spread, of, animals, fungi, and, plants, across, the, single, pleistocene, landmass, the, separate, lands, have, a, related, biota, there, are, over, 300, bird, species, in, west, papua, of, which, at, least, 20,

level, of, endemism, can, be, attributed, to, the, continent, s, long, geographic, isolation, tectonic, stability, and, the, effects, of, an, unusual, pattern, of, climate, change, on, the, soil, and, flora, over, geological, time, australia, and, its, territories, are, home, to, around, 800, species, of, bird, 45, of, these, are, endemic, to, australia, predominant, bird, species, in, australia,
