the, visayas, v, s, a, z, viss, eye, z, or, the, visayan, islands, visayan, kabisay, an, locally, filipino, kabisayaan, are, one, of, the, three, principal, geographical, divisions, of, the, philippines, along, with, luzon, and, mindanao, located, in, the, central, part, of, the, archipelago, it, consists, of, several, islands, primarily, surrounding, the, visayan, sea, although, the, visayas, are, also, considered, the, northeast, extremity, of, the, entire, sulu, sea, its, inhabitants, are, predominantly, the, visayan, peoples, the, major, islands, of, the, visayas, are, panay, negros, cebu, bohol, leyte, and, samar, the, region, may, also, include, the, provinces, of, palawan, romblon, and, masbate, whose, populations, identify, as, visayan, and, whose, languages, are, more, closely, related, to, other, visayan, languages, than, to, the, major, languages, of, luzon, there, are, four, administrative, regions, in, the, visayas, western, visayas, pop, 4, 73, million, negros, island, region, pop, 4, 76, million, central, visayas, 6, 54, million, and, eastern, visayas, 4, 5, million, the, exact, meaning, and, origin, of, the, name, of, the, visayas, is, unknown, the, first, documented, use, of, the, name, is, possibly, by, song, era, chinese, maritime, official, zhao, rugua, as, the, pi, sho, ye, who, raided, the, coasts, of, fujian, and, penghu, during, the, late, 12th, century, using, iron, javelins, attached, to, ropes, as, their, weapons, visayans, were, first, referred, to, by, the, general, term, pintados, the, painted, ones, by, the, spanish, in, reference, to, the, prominent, practice, of, full, body, tattooing, batok, the, word, bisaya, on, the, other, hand, was, first, documented, in, spanish, sources, in, reference, to, the, non, ati, inhabitants, of, the, island, of, panay, however, it, is, likely, that, the, name, was, already, used, as, a, general, endonym, by, visayans, long, before, spanish, colonization, as, evidenced, by, at, least, once, instance, of, a, place, named, bisaya, in, coastal, eastern, mindanao, as, reported, by, the, loaisa, c, 1526, saavedra, c, 1528, and, the, villalobos, c, 1543, expeditions, it, is, likely, that, the, reason, the, spanish, did, not, use, the, term, generally, until, the, later, decades, of, the, 1500s, is, due, to, the, fact, that, people, were, more, likely, to, identify, themselves, with, more, specific, ethnic, names, like, sugbuanon, in, sucesos, de, las, islas, filipinas, 1609, by, antonio, de, morga, he, specifies, that, the, name, bi, aya, is, synonymous, with, pintados, south, of, this, district, lie, the, islands, of, bi, ayas, or, as, they, are, also, called, pintados, they, are, many, in, number, thickly, populated, with, natives, those, of, most,

disposition, and, of, better, nature, and, more, noble, in, their, actions, than, the, inhabitants, of, the, islands, of, luzon, and, its, vicinity, they, differ, from, them, in, their, hair, which, the, men, wear, cut, in, a, cue, like, the, ancient, style, in, espa, a, their, bodies, are, tattooed, with, many, designs, but, the, face, is, not, touched, they, wear, large, earrings, of, gold, and, ivory, in, their, ears, and, bracelets, of, the, same, certain, scarfs, wrapped, round, the, head, very, showy, which, resemble, turbans, and, knotted, very, gracefully, and, edged, with, gold, they, wear, also, a, loose, collarless, jacket, with, tight, sleeves, whose, skirts, reach, half, way, down, the, leg, these, garments, are, fastened, in, front, and, are, made, of, medri, aque, and, colored, silks, they, wear, no, shirts, or, drawers, but, bahaques, of, many, wrappings, which, cover, their, privy, parts, when, they, remove, their, skirts, and, jackets, the, women, are, good, looking, and, graceful, they, are, very, neat, and, walk, slowly, their, hair, is, black, long, and, drawn, into, a, knot, on, the, head, their, robes, are, wrapped, about, the, waist, and, fall,

inhabitants, of, luzon, they, have, the, same, occupations, products, and, means, of, gain, as, the, inhabitants, of, all, the, other, islands, these, visayans, are, a, race, less, inclined, to, agriculture, and, are, skilful, in, navigation, and, eager, for, war, and, raids, for, pillage, and, booty, which, they, call, mangubas, this, means, to, go, out, for, plunder, the, language, of, all, the, pintados, and, bi, ayas, is, one, and, the, same, by, which, they, understand, one, another, when, talking, or, when, writing, with, the, letters, and, characters, of, their, own, which, they, possess, these, resemble, those, of, the, arabs, the, common, manner, of, writing, among, the, natives, is, on, leaves, of, trees, and, on, bamboo, bark, from, the, 1950s, to, 1960s, there, were, spurious, claims, by, various, authors, that, bisaya, is, derived, from, the, historical, empire, of, sri, vijaya, which, came, from, the, sanskrit, term, r, vijaya, arguing, that, the, visayans, were, either, settlers, from, sri, vijaya, or, were, subjects, of, it, this, claim, is, largely, based, only, on, the, resemblance, of, the, word, bisaya, to, vijaya, but, as, the, linguist, eugene, verstraelen, pointed, out, vijaya, would, evolve, into, bidaya, or, biraya, not, bisaya, based, on, how, other, sanskrit, derived, loanwords, become, integrated, into, philippine, languages, the, name, has, also, been, hypothesized, to, be, related, to, the, bisaya, ethnic, group, of, borneo, the, latter, incidentally, recounted, in, the, controversial, maragtas, epic, as, the, alleged, origins, of, the, ancestral, settlers, in, panay, however, historical, archeological, and, linguistic, evidence, for, this, are, still, paltry, the, languages, of, the, bisaya, of, borneo, and, of, the, bisaya, of, the, philippines, do, not, show, any, special, correlation, apart, from, the, fact, that, they, all, belong, to, the, same, austronesian, family, similarly, there, are, claims, that, it, was, the, name, of, a, folk, hero, allegedly, sri, visaya, or, that, it, originated, from, the, exclamation, bisai, yah, how, beautiful, by, the, sultan, of, brunei, who, was, visiting, visayas, for, the, first, time, all, these, claims, have, been, challenged, and, remain, as, mere, speculations, and, folk, etymologies, visayas, region, is, located, in, central, philippines, with, a, total,

provinces, are, scholars, have, argued, that, the, region, of, mimaropa, and, the, province, of, masbate, are, all, part, of, the, visayas, in, line, with, the, non, centric, view, this, is, contested, by, a, few, politicians, in, line, with, the, manila, centric, view, languages, spoken, at, home, are, primarily, visayan, languages, despite, the, usual, misconception, that, these, are, dialects, of, a, single, macrolanguage, cebuano, is, the, largest, native, language, spoken, on, visayas, island, where, approximately, 20, million, natives, speak, it, major, languages, include,

most, especially, among, urbanized, visayans, for, instance, english, rather, than, tagalog, is, frequently, used, in, schools, public, signs, and, mass, media, although, the, word, bisaya, has, been, adapted, into, the, cebuano, terminology, for, centuries, it, should, never, be, equated, with, the, word, cebuano, even, if, its, origin, still, has, a, lot, of, issues, up, to, the, present, time, the, word, bisaya, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, inhabitants, who, originated, born, in, any, of, the, islands, within, the, visayas, region, these, inhabitants, may, be, currently, living, in, the, visayas, region, or, migrated, to, other, islands, in, the, philippines, including, luzon, and, mindanao, it, is, therefore, not, accurate, to, exclusively, identify, bisaya, with, cebuano, because, that, precludes, all, the, other, inhabitants, of, the, region, all, cebuanos, can, be, called, bisaya, but, not, all, bisaya, can, be, called, cebuanos, furthermore, bisaya, should, not, be, referred, to, as, a, language, and, should, never, be, equated, with, the, cebuano, language, although, the, majority, of, the, visayan, inhabitants, speak, the, cebuano, language, the, most, commonly, used, cebuano, term, to, have, a, reference, to, the, visayan, group, of, languages, is, binisaya, it, is, an, adjective, that, is, also, used, to, describe, anything, that, pertains, to, being, visayan, for, example, binisaya, ng, awit, is, translated, into, english, as, visayan, song, in, mindanao, migrant, ethnic, individuals, from, luzon, as, well, as, indigenous, peoples, assimilated, into, a, society, of, cebuano, speaking, majority, hiligaynon, speaking, majority, in, the, case, of, soccsksargen, over, many, years, identifying, themselves, as, visayans, upon, learning, cebuano, despite, many, of, them, still, know, and, retain, their, non, visayan, roots, and, some, speak, their, ancestor, s, language, fluently, at, least, as, their, second, or, third, languages, 11, 00, n, 123, 30, e, 11, 000, n, 123, 500, e, 11, 000, 123, 500
