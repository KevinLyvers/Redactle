through, the, canadian, rockies, ten, years, later, on, november, 7, 1885, the, last, spike, was, driven, in, craigellachie, british, columbia, with, conflicting, claims, over, the, discovery, of, hot, springs, in, banff, prime, minister, john, a, macdonald, decided, to, set, aside, a, small, reserve, of, 26, square, kilometres, 10, sq, mi, around, the, hot, springs, at, cave, and, basin, as, a, public, park, known, as, the, banff, hot, springs, reserve, in, 1885, under, the, rocky, mountains, park, act, enacted, on, june, 23, 1887, the, park, was, expanded, to, 674, km, 2, 260, sq, mi,

mountain, formation, ceased, erosion, carved, the, mountains, into, their, present, rugged, shape, 80, 81, the, erosion, was, first, due, to, water, then, was, greatly, accelerated, by, the, quaternary, glaciation, 2, 5, million, years, ago, glacial, landforms, dominate, banff, s, geomorphology, with, examples, of, all, classic, glacial, forms, including, cirques, ar, tes, hanging, valleys, moraines, and, u, shaped, valleys, the, pre, existing, structure, left, over, from, mountain, building, strongly, guided, glacial, erosion, mountains, in, banff, include, complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and, sawback, mountains, many, of, the, mountain, ranges, trend, northwest, to, southeast, with, sedimentary, layering, dipping, down, to, the, west, at, 40, 60, degrees, this, leads, to, dip, slope, landforms, with, generally, steeper, east, and, north, faces, and, trellis, drainage, where, rivers, and, old, glacial, valleys, followed, the, weaker, layers, in, the, rocks, as, they, were, relatively, easily, weathered, and, eroded, classic, examples, are, found, at, the, banff, townsite, proper, mount, rundle, is, a, classic, dip, slope, mountain, 28, just, to, the, north, of, the, banff, townsite, castle, mountain, is, composed, of, numerous, cambrian, age, rock, formations, the, uppermost, section, of, the, peak, consists, of, relatively, harder, dolomite, from, the, eldon, formation, below, that, lies, the, less, dense, shales, of, the, stephen, formation, and, the, lowest, exposed, cliffs, are, limestones, of, the, cathedral, formation, 76, dogtooth, mountains, such, as, mount, louis, exhibit, sharp, jagged, slopes, 114, the, sawback, range, which, consists, of, nearly, vertical, dipping, sedimentary, layers, has, been, eroded, by, cross, gullies, the, erosion, of, these, almost, vertical, layers, of, rock, strata, in, the, sawback, range, has, resulted, in, formations, that, appear, like, the, teeth, on, a, saw, blade, erosion, and, deposition, of, higher, elevation, rock, layers, has, resulted, in, scree, deposits, at, the, lowest, elevations, of, many, of, the, mountains, banff, national, park, has, numerous, large, glaciers, and, icefields, 100, of, which, can, be, observed, from, the, icefields, parkway, small, cirque, glaciers, are, fairly, common, in, the, main, ranges, in, depressions, on, the, side, of, many, mountains, as, with, the, majority, of, mountain, glaciers, around, the, world, the, glaciers, in, banff, are, retreating, while, peyto, glacier, is, one, of, the, longest, continuously, studied, glaciers, in, the, world, with, research, extending, back, to, the, 1970s, most, of, the, glaciers, of, the, canadian, rockies, have, only, been, scientifically, evaluated, since, the, late, 1990s, glaciologists, are, now, researching, the, glaciers, in, the, park, more, thoroughly, and, have, been, analyzing, the, impact, that, reduced, glacier, ice, may, have, on, water, supplies, to, streams, and, rivers, estimates, are, that, 150, glaciers, disappeared, in, the, canadian, rockies, areas, both, inside, and, outside, banff, national, park, between, the, years, 1920, and, 1985, another, 150, glaciers, disappeared, between, 1985, and, 2005, indicating, that, the, retreat, and, disappearance, of, glaciers, is, accelerating, in, banff, national, park, alone, in, 1985, there, were, 365, glaciers, but, by, 2005, 29, glaciers, had, disappeared, the, total, glaciated, area, dropped, from, 625, to, 500, square, kilometres, 241, to, 193, sq, mi, in, that, time,

banff, national, park, spans, three, ecoregions, including, montane, subalpine, and, alpine, the, subalpine, ecoregion, which, consists, mainly, of, dense, forest, comprises, 53, percent, of, banff, s, area, 27, percent, of, the, park, is, located, above, the, tree, line, in, the, alpine, ecoregion, the, tree, line, in, banff, lies, approximately, at, 2, 300, m, 7, 500, ft, with, open, meadows, at, alpine, regions, and, some, areas, covered, by, glaciers, a, small, portion, 3, percent, of, the, park, at, lower, elevations, is, in, the, montane, ecoregion, lodgepole, pine, forests, dominate, the, montane, region, of, banff, with, engelmann, spruce, willow, aspen, occasional, douglas, fir, and, a, few, douglas, maple, interspersed, engelmann, spruce, are, more, common, in, the, subalpine, regions, of, banff, with, some, areas, of, lodgepole, pine, and, subalpine, fir, the, montane, areas, in, the, bow, valley, which, tend, to, be, the, preferred, habitat, for, wildlife, have, been, subjected, to, significant, human, development, over, the, years, the, park, has, 56, recorded, mammal, species, grizzly, bears, and, black, bears, inhabit, the, forested, regions, cougar, lynx,

including, around, and, sometimes, in, the, banff, townsite, while, moose, tend, to, be, more, elusive, sticking, primarily, to, wetland, areas, and, near, streams, in, the, alpine, regions, mountain, goat, bighorn, sheep, marmot, and, pika, are, widespread, other, mammals, such, as, beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe, hare, and, columbian, ground, squirrel, are, the, more, commonly, observed, smaller, mammals, caribou, were, the, rarest, large, mammals, in, the, park, but, an, avalanche, in, 2009, may, have, killed, the, last, five, remaining, within, park, boundaries, the, american, bison, was, extirpated, in, banff, but, was, brought, back, to, the, park, in, 2017, and, one, free, roaming, herd, lives, within, the, protected, area, due, to, the, harsh, winters, the, park, has, few, reptile, and, amphibian, species, with, only, one, species, of, toad, three, species, of, frog, one, salamander, species, and, two, species, of, snakes, that, have, been, identified, at, least, 280, species, of, birds, can, be, found, in, banff, including, bald, and, golden, eagles, red, tailed, hawk, osprey, and, merlin, all, of, which, are, predatory, species, additionally, commonly, seen, species, such, as, the, canada, jay, american, three, toed, woodpecker, mountain, bluebird, clark, s, nutcracker, mountain, chickadee, and, pipit, are, frequently, found, in, the, lower, elevations, the, white, tailed, ptarmigan, is, a, ground, bird, that, is, often, seen, in, the, alpine, zones, rivers, and, lakes, are, frequented, by, over, a, hundred, different, species, including, loon, heron, and, mallard, which, spend, their, summers, in, the, park, endangered, species, in, banff, include, the, banff, springs, snail, physella, johnsoni, that, is, found, in, the, hot, springs, of, banff, and, the, woodland, caribou, mountain, pine, beetles, have, caused, a, number, of, large, scale, infestations, in, banff, national, park, feeding, on, the, phloem, of, mature, lodgepole, pines, alberta, s, first, known, outbreak, occurred, in, 1940, infecting, 43, km, 2, 17, sq, mi, of, forest, in, banff, a, second, major, outbreak, occurred, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, in, banff, and, the, surrounding, rocky, mountains, region, banff, national, park, is, the, most, visited, alberta, tourist, destination, and, one, of, the, most, visited, national, parks, in, north, america, with, more, than, three, million, tourists, annually, tourism, in, banff, contributes, an, estimated, ca, 6, billion, annually, to, the, economy, a, park, pass, is, required, for, stopping, in, the, park, and, permit, checks, are, common, during, the, summer, months, especially, at, lake, louise, and, the, start, of, the, icefields, parkway, a, permit, is, not, required, if, travelling, straight, through, the, park, without, stopping, approximately, 5, million, people, pass, through, banff, annually, on, the, trans, canada, highway, without, stopping, in, 2009, banff, lake, louise, tourism, hoped, the, appearance, of, the, crasher, squirrel, internet, meme, would, stimulate, interest, in, the, park, the, meme, is, based, on, a, photograph, of, a, minnesotan, couple, visiting, the, park, on, the, shore, of, lake, minnewanka, that, was, crashed, by, a, columbian, ground, squirrel, the, photograph, was, published, in, major, news, sources, around, the, world, and, the, image, of, the, squirrel, was, digitally, manipulated, into, humorous, photos, banff, national, park, is, managed, by, parks, canada, under, the, national, parks, act, which, was, passed, in, 1930, over, time, park, management, policies, have, increasingly, emphasized, environmental, protection, over, development, in, 1964, a, policy, statement, was, issued, that, reiterated, ideals, of, conservation, laid, out, in, the, 1930, act, with, the, controversial, bid, for, the, 1972, winter, olympics, environmental, groups, became, more, influential, leading, parks, canada, to, withdraw, its, support, for, the, bid, the, 1979, beaver, book, was, a, major, new, policy, which, emphasized, conservation, in, 1988, the, national, parks, act, was, amended, making, the, maintenance, of, ecological, integrity, the, top, priority, the, amendment, also, paved, the, way, for, non, governmental, organizations, to, challenge, parks, canada, in, court, for, breaches, in, adhering, to, the, act, in, 1994, parks, canada, established, revised, guiding, principles, and, operating, policies, which, included, a, mandate, for, the, banff, bow, valley, study, to, draft, management, recommendations, as, with, other, national, parks, banff, is, required, to, have, a, park, management, plan, on, a, provincial, level, the, park, area, and, the, included, communities, other, than, the, town, of, banff, which, is, an, incorporated, municipality, are, administered, by, alberta, municipal, affairs, as, improvement, district, no, 9, banff, the, park, was, originally, considered, as, a, recreational, area, for, visitors, offering, multiple, leisure, activities, the, original, wildlife, policy, viewed, wildlife, in, banff, only, as, game, or, pests, up, until, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, ecological, awareness, increased, management, procedures, expanded, with, the, inclusion, of, public, participation, in, many, management, decisions, simultaneously, the, increase, in, human, construction, such, as, new, highways, on, the, natural, landscape, increased, the, frequency, of, human, animal, conflicts, in, 1988, wildlife, began, to, be, considered, an, integral, part, of, the, ecosystem, the, park, now, has, a, number, of, wildlife, management, strategies, that, aim, to, conserve, certain, species, parks, canada, uses, an, ecosystem, based, management, approach, that, aims, to, preserve, the, ecology, of, the, park, while, still, providing, for, visitors, management, decisions, are, based, on, modern, scientific, ecological, information, as, well, as, traditional, knowledge, elk, are, a, very, important, species, in, banff, national, park, partly, because, they, represent, a, source, of, food, for, declining, wolves, however, they, also, have, harsh, impacts, on, the, environment, large, elk, populations, cause, vegetation, degradation, human, animal, conflicts, and, destabilization, of, biological, interactions, in, 1999, the, implementation, of, the, banff, national, park, elk, management, strategy, by, parks, canada, and, the, elk, advisory, committee, aimed, to, monitor, and, control, the, population, to, decrease, conflicts, and, aid, ecological, process, recovery, elk, handling, facilities, are, areas, of, pens, with, loading, and, unloading, ramps, where, water, and, food, are, provided, to, the, elk, they, were, created, to, help, reduce, herd, numbers, by, increasing, wariness, and, encouraging, migratory, behaviour, deterring, the, elk, from, the, town, of, banff, these, measures, allowed, more, predator, prey, interactions, thanks, to, the, creation, of, corridors, they, also, increased, elk, migration, restored, the, willow, and, aspen, communities, and, highlighted, the, primary, role, of, wolves, in, elk, population, management, the, state, of, grizzly, bear, populations, in, banff, is, seen, as, a, proxy, for, ecological, integrity, to, keep, bears, away, from, humans, an, electric, fence, was, put, up, around, the, summer, gondola, and, parking, lot, at, lake, louise, in, 2001, bear, proof, garbage, cans, which, do, not, allow, bears, to, access, their, contents, help, to, deter, them, from, human, sites, the, fruit, of, buffaloberry, bushes, is, eaten, by, bears, so, the, bushes, have, been, removed, in, some, areas, where, the, risk, of, a, bear, human, encounter, is, high, aversive, conditioning, deters, bears, by, modifying, their, behaviour, deterrents, such, as, noise, makers, and, rubber, bullets, are, used, each, time, the, bear, performs, an, undesirable, action, advice, is, also, given, to, people, to, avoid, an, eventual, habituation, of, bears, to, human, presence, if, this, conditioning, is, continual, the, bear, will, be, less, likely, to, continue, the, undesirable, behaviour, crossing, into, campsites, and, roads, etc, southern, mountain, caribou, management, previously, aimed, to, identify, what, was, threatening, caribou, populations, and, find, solutions, to, mitigate, the, threats, but, the, last, caribou, in, the, park, was, found, dead, in, an, avalanche, in, 2009, there, was, concern, over, why, more, had, not, been, done, to, save, the, caribou, population, the, primary, reason, for, their, decline, is, thought, to, have, been, habitat, loss, and, altered, predator, prey, dynamics, park, management, began, monitoring, the, last, five, caribou, in, the, park, in, 2002, and, taking, actions, such, as, reducing, impacts, of, humans, conducting, studies, of, the, population, and, investigating, the, possibility, of, translocating, caribou, to, increase, the, banff, population, in, the, mid, 1980s, gray, wolves, recolonized, the, bow, valley, in, banff, national, park, they, had, been, absent, for, 30, years, due, to, systematic, predator, control, hunting, which, began, in, 1850, wolves, filtered, back, to, banff, and, recolonized, one, zone, of, the, bow, valley, in, 1985, and, another, in, 1991, a, high, level, of, human, use, surrounding, a, third, zone, at, banff, townsite, has, deterred, the, wolves, from, that, area, the, wolves, are, important, in, controlling, elk, populations, and, improve, the, balance, of, the, ecosystem, a, routine, park, study, to, monitor, the, wolves, in, banff, has, now, grown, into, the, southern, rockies, canine, project, the, largest, wolf, research, project, in, north, america, the, estimated, wolf, population, in, banff, national, park, and, the, surrounding, areas, is, now, 60, 70, animals, plains, bisons, were, reintroduced, to, banff, in, 2017, the, park, has, an, extensive, system, of, grasslands, in, backcountry, valleys, that, are, perfect, for, the, bison, 16, bison, were, translocated, from, elk, island, national, park, and, initially, placed, under, observation, for, a, year, in, an, enclosed, pasture, within, a, 1, 200, square, kilometres, 460, sq, mi, reintroduction, site, near, panther, river, valley, after, 18, months, of, acclimation, the, herd, was, released, into, the, reintroduction, site, and, as, of, august, 2021, the, herd, had, grown, to, 66, wildlife, crossings, have, been, successful, in, banff, national, park, at, reducing, the, number, of, animals, killed, on, the, roads, there, is, also, 82, kilometres, 51, mi, of, fencing, at, the, edge, of, the, highway, in, the, park, to, prevent, animals, from, getting, onto, the, roads, since, it, was, put, up, this, has, reduced, collisions, between, wildlife, and, vehicles, by, over, 80, per, cent, train, tracks, still, pose, challenges, to, conservationists, many, bears, have, been, killed, by, trains, often, because, they, are, attracted, to, grain, spills, along, the, tracks, transportation, corridors, provide, openings, for, plants, which, are, also, utilised, by, bears, a, partnership, between, parks, canada, and, canadian, pacific, railway, allowed, the, creation, of, the, first, railway, bear, conflict, mitigation, symposium, in, 2010, initiatives, included, building, wooden, pegboards, to, fence, off, the, sides, of, tracks, and, chemically, treating, grains, to, deter, the, bears, after, a, complete, review, of, the, research, projects, the, development, of, some, of, them, has, been, authorized, including, grain, alteration, and, the, use, of, cameras, to, study, the, behavioural, response, of, bears, to, trains, in, 2011, parks, canada, began, to, study, the, effectiveness, of, electro, mats, large, mats, that, give, a, small, electric, shock, to, animals, that, step, on, them, as, a, potential, deterrent, around, train, tracks, a, trial, installment, of, the, mats, was, placed, in, banff, to, test, their, effectiveness, in, deterring, animals, like, bears, from, gaining, access, to, the, fenced, train, tracks, inside, the, park, general, prohibitions, implemented, to, ensure, wildlife, respect, include, the, prohibition, of, feeding, touching, or, holding, animals, in, captivity, and, the, disturbance, or, destruction, of, bird, nests, since, the, 19th, century, humans, have, impacted, banff, s, environment, through, introduction, of, non, native, species, controls, on, other, species, and, development, in, the, bow, valley, among, other, human, activities, bison, once, lived, in, the, valleys, of, banff, and, were, hunted, by, indigenous, people, but, the, last, bison, were, killed, off, in, 1850s, in, 2017, a, small, herd, of, sixteen, plains, bison, were, reintroduced, into, an, eastern, section, of, the, park, elk, are, not, indigenous, to, banff, and, were, introduced, in, 1917, with, 57, elk, brought, in, from, yellowstone, national, park, the, introduction, of, elk, to, banff, combined, with, controls, on, coyote, and, wolves, by, parks, canada, beginning, in, the, 1930s, has, caused, imbalance, of, the, ecosystem, other, species, that, have, been, displaced, from, the, bow, valley, include, grizzly, bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and, moose, beginning, in, 1985, gray, wolves, were, recolonizing, areas, in, the, bow, valley, however, the, wolf, population, has, struggled, with, 32, wolf, deaths, along, the, trans, canada, highway, between, 1987, and, 2000, leaving, only, 31, wolves, in, the, area, the, population, of, bull, trout, and, other, native, species, of, fish, in, banff, s, lakes, has, also, dwindled, with, the, introduction, of, non, native, species, including, brook, trout, and, rainbow, trout, lake, trout, westslope, cutthroat, trout, and, chiselmouth, are, rare, native, species, while, chinook, salmon, white, sturgeon, pacific, lamprey, and, banff, longnose, dace, are, likely, extirpated, locally, the, banff, longnose, dace, once, only, found, in, banff, is, now, an, extinct, species, the, trans, canada, highway, passing, through, banff, has, been, problematic, posing, hazards, for, wildlife, due, to, vehicle, traffic, and, as, an, impediment, to, wildlife, migration, grizzly, bears, are, among, the, species, impacted, by, the, highway, which, together, with, other, developments, in, banff, has, caused, fragmentation, of, the, landscape, grizzly, bears, prefer, the, montane, habitat, which, has, been, most, impacted, by, development, wildlife, crossings, including, a, series, of, underpasses, and, six, wildlife, overpasses, have, been, constructed, at, a, number, of, points, along, the, trans, canada, highway, to, help, alleviate, this, problem, parks, canada, management, practices, notably, fire, suppression, since, banff, national, park, was, established, have, impacted, the, park, s, ecosystem, since, 1983, parks, canada, has, adopted, a, strategy, that, employed, prescribed, burns, which, helps, to, mimic, effects, of, natural, fires, banff, national, park, is, bisected, by, two, highways, that, cross, the, alberta, british, columbia, border, while, another, provides, a, third, access, within, alberta, the, trans, canada, highway, highway, 1, bisects, the, park, in, an, east, west, direction, connecting, it, to, vancouver, to, the, west, and, calgary, to, the, east, highway, 93, bisects, the, park, in, a, north, south, direction, connecting, it, to, cranbrook, to, the, south, and, jasper, to, the, north, the, portion, of, highway, 93, north, of, lake, louise, is, known, as, the, icefields, parkway, whereas, the, portion, southwest, of, castle, junction, is, known, as, the, banff, windermere, parkway, highway, 11, the, david, thompson, highway, connects, the, icefields, parkway, at, saskatchewan, river, crossing, to, rocky, mountain, house, to, the, northeast, within, the, park, highway, 1a, also, known, as, the, bow, valley, parkway, loosely, parallels, highway, 1, between, banff, and, lake, louise, the, closest, airport, with, long, haul, flights, is, calgary, international, airport, yyc, other, transportation, facilities, within, banff, national, park, include, a, canadian, pacific, rail, line, that, generally, parallels, highway, 1, and, an, airport, known, as, the, banff, park, compound, heliport, in, 1978, expansion, of, sunshine, village, ski, resort, was, approved, with, added, parking, hotel, expansion, and, development, of, goat, s, eye, mountain, implementation, of, this, development, proposal, was, delayed, through, the, 1980s, while, environmental, assessments, were, conducted, in, 1989, sunshine, village, withdrew, its, development, proposal, in, light, of, government, reservations, and, submitted, a, revised, proposal, in, 1992, this, plan, was, approved, by, the, government, pending, environmental, review, subsequently, the, canadian, parks, and, wilderness, society, cpaws, filed, a, court, injunction, which, halted, the, development, cpaws, also, put, pressure, on, unesco, to, revoke, banff, s, world, heritage, site, status, over, concerns, that, developments, were, harming, the, park, s, ecological, health, while, the, national, parks, act, and, the, 1988, amendment, emphasize, ecological, integrity, in, practice, banff, has, suffered, from, inconsistent, application, of, the, policies, in, 1994, the, banff, bow, valley, study, was, mandated, by, sheila, copps, the, minister, responsible, for, parks, canada, to, provide, recommendations, on, how, to, better, manage, human, use, and, development, and, maintain, ecological, integrity, while, the, two, year, banff, bow, valley, study, was, underway, development, projects, were, halted, including, the, expansion, of, sunshine, village, and, the, twinning, of, the, trans, canada, highway, between, castle, junction, and, sunshine, the, panel, issued, over, 500, recommendations, including, limiting, the, growth, of, the, banff, townsite, capping, the, town, s, population, at, 10, 000, placing, quotas, for, popular, hiking, trails, and, curtailing, development, in, the, park, another, recommendation, was, to, fence, off, the, townsite, to, reduce, confrontations, between, people, and, elk, the, proposed, fencing, was, also, intended, to, reduce, access, to, this, refuge, for, elk, from, predators, such, as, wolves, that, tended, to, avoid, the, townsite, upon, release, of, the, report, copps, immediately, moved, to, accept, the, proposal, to, cap, the, town, population, she, also, ordered, a, small, airstrip, to, be, removed, along, with, a, buffalo, paddock, and, cadet, camp, that, inhibited, wildlife, movement, in, response, to, concerns, and, recommendations, raised, by, the, banff, bow, valley, study, a, number, of, development, plans, were, curtailed, in, the, 1990s, plans, to, add, nine, holes, at, the, banff, springs, golf, resort, were, withdrawn, in, 1996, with, the, cap, on, growth, in, the, town, of, banff, canmore, located, just, outside, the, banff, boundary, has, been, growing, rapidly, to, serve, increasing, demands, of, tourists, major, development, proposals, for, canmore, have, included, the, three, sisters, golf, resorts, proposed, in, 1992, which, has, been, the, subject, of, contentious, debate, with, environmental, groups, arguing, that, the, development, would, fragment, important, wildlife, corridors, in, the, bow, valley
