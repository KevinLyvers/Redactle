been, located, at, the, mashhad, at, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, 3rd, century, ah, mashhad, was, a, small, city, called, sanabad, which, was, situated, 24, kilometres, 15, miles, away, from, tus, there, was, a, summer, palace, of, humayd, ibn, qahtaba, the, governor, of, khurasan, in, 808, when, harun, al, rashid, abbasid, caliph, was, passing, through, to, quell, the, insurrection,

figures, like, nizam, al, mulk, al, ghazali, ahmad, ghazali, ferdowsi, asadi, tusi, and, shaykh, tusi, earlier, arab, geographers, have, correctly, identified, mashhad, and, tus, as, two, separate, cities, that, are, now, located, about, 19, kilometres, 12, miles, from, each, other, although, some, believe, that, after, this, event, the, city, was, called, mashhad, al, ridha, the, place, of, martyrdom, of, al, ridha, it, seems, that, mashhad, as, a, place, name, first, appears, in, al, maqdisi, i, e, in, the, last, third, of, the, 10th, century, about, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, the, traveller, ibn, battuta, uses, the, expression, town, of, mashhad, al, rida, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, the, name, nuqan, which, is, still, found, on, coins, in, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, under, the, il, khanids, seems, to, have, been, gradually, replaced, by, al, mashhad, or, mashhad, shias, began, to, make, pilgrimages, to, his, grave, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, a, dome, was, built, above, the, grave, and, many, other, buildings, and, bazaars, sprang, up, around, it, over, the, course, of, more, than, a, millennium, it, has, been, destroyed, and, rebuilt, several, times, in, 1161, however, the, seljuks, seized, the, city, but, they, spared, the, sacred, area, their, pillaging, mashad, al, ridha, was, not, considered, a, great, city, until, mongol, raids, in, 1220, which, caused, the, destruction, of, many, large, cities, in, khurasan, but, leaving, mashhad, relatively, intact, in, the, hands, of, mongolian, commanders, because, of, the, cemetery, of, ali, al, rezza, and, harun, al, rashid, the, latter, was, stolen, thus, the, survivors, of, the, massacres, migrated, to, mashhad, when, the, arab, traveller, ibn, battuta, visited, the, town, in, 1333, he, reported, that, it, was, a, large, town, with, abundant, fruit, trees, streams, and, mills, a, great, dome, of, elegant, construction, surmounts, the, noble,

when, it, is, thought, to, be, cooked, with, any, food, available, the, main, ingredients, are, meat, grains, and, abundant, spices, and, be, a, mongolian, word, it, seems, that, the, importance, of, sanabad, mashhad, continually, increased, with, the, growing, fame, of, its, sanctuary, and, the, decline, of, tus, which, received, its, death, blow, in, 1389, from, miran, shah, a, son, of, timur,

was, henceforth, abandoned, and, mashhad, took, its, place, as, the, capital, of, the, district, later, on, during, the, reign, of, the, timurid, shahrukh, mirza, mashhad, became, one, of, the, main, cities, of, the, realm, in, 1418, his, wife, goharshad, funded, the, construction, of, an, outstanding, mosque, beside, the, shrine, which, is, known, as, the, goharshad, mosque, the, mosque, remains,

was, a, disastrous, one, for, mashhad, the, shaybanid, abd, al, mu, min, after, a, four, months, siege, forced, the, town, to, surrender, shah, abbas, i, who, lived, in, mashhad, from, 1585, until, his, official, ascent, of, the, throne, in, qazwin, in, 1587, was, not, able, to, retake, mashhad, from, the, zbegs, until, 1598, mashhad, was, retaken, by, the, shah, abbas, after, a, long, and,
