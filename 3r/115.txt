the, caspian, sea, is, the, world, s, largest, inland, body, of, water, often, described, as, the, world, s, largest, lake, and, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, full, fledged, sea, an, endorheic, basin, it, lies, between, europe, and, asia, east, of, the, caucasus, west, of, the, broad, steppe, of, central, asia, south, of, the, fertile, plains, of, southern, russia, in, eastern, europe, and, north, of, the, mountainous, iranian, plateau, it, covers, a, surface, area, of, 371, 000, km, 2, 143, 000, sq, mi, excluding, the, highly, saline, lagoon, of, garabogazk, l, to, its, east, an, area, approximately, equal, to, that, of, japan, with, a, volume, of, 78, 200, km, 3, 19, 000, cu, mi, it, has, a, salinity, of, approximately, 1, 2, 12, g, l, about, a, third, of, the, salinity, of, average, seawater, it, is, bounded, by, kazakhstan, to, the, northeast, russia, to, the, northwest, azerbaijan, to, the, southwest, iran, to, the, south, and, turkmenistan, to, the, southeast, the, sea, stretches, 1, 200, km, 750, mi, from, north, to, south, with, an, average, width, of, 320, km, 200, mi, its, gross, coverage, is, 386, 400, km, 2, 149, 200, sq, mi, and, the, surface, is, about, 27, m, 89, ft, below, sea, level, its, main, freshwater, inflow, europe, s, longest, river, the, volga, enters, at, the, shallow, north, end, two, deep, basins, form, its, central, and, southern, zones, these, lead, to, horizontal, differences, in, temperature, salinity, and, ecology, the, seabed, in, the, south, reaches, 1, 023, m, 3, 356, ft, below, sea, level, which, is, the, third, lowest, natural, non, oceanic, depression, on, earth, after, baikal, and, tanganyika, lakes, written, accounts, from, the, ancient, inhabitants, of, its, coast, perceived, the, caspian, sea, as, an, ocean, probably, because, of, its, salinity, and, large, size, with, a, surface, area, of, 371, 000, square, kilometres, 143, 000, sq, mi, the, caspian, sea, is, nearly, five, times, as, big, as, lake, superior, 82, 000, square, kilometres, 32, 000, sq, mi, the, caspian, sea, is, home, to, a, wide, range, of, species, and, is, famous, for, its, caviar, and, oil, industries, pollution, from, the, oil, industry, and, dams, on, rivers, that, drain, into, it, have, harmed, its, ecology, it, is, predicted, that, during, the, 21st, century, the, depth, of, the, sea, will, decrease, by, 9, 18, m, 30, 60, ft, due, to, global, warming, and, the, process, of, desertification, causing, an, ecocide, the, sea, s, name, stems, from, caspi, the, ancient, people, who, lived, to, the, southwest, of, the, sea, in, transcaucasia, strabo, died, circa, ad, 24, wrote, that, to, the, country, of, the, albanians, caucasian, albania, not, to, be, confused, with, the, country, of, albania, belongs, also, the, territory, called, caspiane, which, was, named, after, the, caspian, tribe, as, was, also, the, sea, but, the, tribe, has, now, disappeared, moreover, the, caspian, gates, part, of, iran, s, tehran, province, may, evince, such, people, migrated, to, the, south, the, iranian, city, of, qazvin, shares, the, root, of, its, name, with, this, common, name, for, the, sea, the, traditional, and, medieval, arabic, name, for, the, sea, was, ba, r, sea, khazar, but, in, recent, centuries, the, common, and, standard, name, in, arabic, language, has, become, ba, r, qazvin, the, arabized, form, of, caspian, in, modern, russian, language, it, is, known, as, russian, kaspiyskoye, more, some, turkic, ethnic, groups, refer, to, it, with, the, caspi, an, descriptor, in, kazakh, it, is, called, kaspiy, te, izi, kyrgyz, romanized, kaspiy, de, izi, uzbek, kaspiy, dengizi, others, refer, to, it, as, the, khazar, sea, turkmen, hazar, de, izi, azerbaijani, x, z, r, d, nizi, turkish, hazar, denizi, in, all, these, the, first, word, refers, to, the, historical, khazar, khaganate, a, large, empire, based, to, the, north, of, the, caspian, sea, between, the, 7th, and, 10th, centuries, in, iran, the, lake, is, referred, to, as, the, mazandaran, sea, persian, after, the, historic, mazandaran, province, at, its, southern, shores, old, russian, sources, use, the, khvalyn, or, khvalis, sea, after, the, name, of, khwarezmia, among, greeks, and, persians, in, classical, antiquity, it, was, the, hyrcanian, ocean, renaissance, european, maps, labelled, it, as, the, abbacuch, sea, oronce, fine, s, 1531, world, map, mar, de, bachu, ortellius, 1570, map, or, mar, de, sala, the, mercator, 1569, world, map, it, was, also, sometimes, called, the, kumyk, sea, and, tarki, sea, derived, from, the, name, of, the, kumyks, and, their, historical, capital, tarki, the, caspian, sea, is, at, its, south, caspian, basin, like, the, black, sea, a, remnant, of, the, ancient, paratethys, sea, its, seafloor, is, therefore, a, standard, oceanic, basalt, and, not, a, continental, granite, body, it, is, estimated, to, be, about, 30, million, years, old, and, became, landlocked, in, the, late, miocene, about, 5, 5, million, years, ago, due, to, tectonic, uplift, and, a, fall, in, sea, level, the, caspian, sea, was, a, comparatively, small, endorheic, lake, during, the, pliocene, but, its, surface, area, increased, fivefold, around, the, time, of, the, pliocene, pleistocene, transition, during, warm, and, dry, climatic, periods, the, landlocked, sea, almost, dried, up, depositing, evaporitic, sediments, like, halite, that, were, covered, by, wind, blown, deposits, and, were, sealed, off, as, an, evaporite, sink, when, cool, wet, climates, refilled, the, basin, comparable, evaporite, beds, underlie, the, mediterranean, due, to, the, current, inflow, of, fresh, water, in, the, north, the, caspian, sea, water, is, almost, fresh, in, its, northern, portions, getting, more, brackish, toward, the, south, it, is, most, saline, on, the, iranian, shore, where, the, catchment, basin, contributes, little, flow, currently, the, mean, salinity, of, the, caspian, is, one, third, that, of, earth, s, oceans, the, garabogazk, l, lagoon, which, dried, up, when, water, flow, from, the, main, body, of, the, caspian, was, blocked, in, the, 1980s, but, has, since, been, restored, routinely, exceeds, oceanic, salinity, by, a, factor, of, 10, the, caspian, sea, is, the, largest, inland, body, of, water, in, the, world, by, area, and, accounts, for, 40, 44, of, the, total, lake, waters, of, the, world, and, covers, an, area, larger, than, germany, the, coastlines, of, the, caspian, are, shared, by, azerbaijan, iran, kazakhstan, russia, and, turkmenistan, the, caspian, is, divided, into, three, distinct, physical, regions, the, northern, middle, and, southern, caspian, the, northern, middle, boundary, is, the, mangyshlak, threshold, which, runs, through, chechen, island, and, cape, tiub, karagan, the, middle, southern, boundary, is, the, apsheron, threshold, a, sill, of, tectonic, origin, between, the, eurasian, continent, and, an, oceanic, remnant, that, runs, through, zhiloi, island, and, cape, kuuli, the, garabogazk, l, bay, is, the, saline, eastern, inlet, of, the, caspian, which, is, part, of, turkmenistan, and, at, times, has, been, a, lake, in, its, own, right, due, to, the, isthmus, that, cuts, it, off, from, the, caspian, differences, between, the, three, regions, are, dramatic, the, northern, caspian, only, includes, the, caspian, shelf, and, is, very, shallow, it, accounts, for, less, than, 1, of, the, total, water, volume, with, an, average, depth, of, only, 5, 6, m, 16, 20, ft, the, sea, noticeably, drops, off, towards, the, middle, caspian, where, the, average, depth, is, 190, m, 620, ft, the, southern, caspian, is, the, deepest, with, oceanic, depths, of, over, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, greatly, exceeding, the, depth, of, other, regional, seas, such, as, the, persian, gulf, the, middle, and, southern, caspian, account, for, 33, and, 66, of, the, total, water, volume, respectively, the, northern, portion, of, the, caspian, sea, typically, freezes, in, the, winter, and, in, the, coldest, winters, ice, forms, in, the, south, as, well, over, 130, rivers, provide, inflow, to, the, caspian, the, volga, river, being, the, largest, a, second, affluent, the, ural, river, flows, in, from, the, north, and, the, kura, river, from, the, west, in, the, past, the, amu, darya, oxus, of, central, asia, in, the, east, often, changed, course, to, empty, into, the, caspian, through, a, now, desiccated, riverbed, called, the, uzboy, river, as, did, the, syr, darya, farther, north, the, caspian, has, several, small, islands, primarily, located, in, the, north, with, a, collective, land, area, of, roughly, 2, 000, km, 2, 770, sq, mi, adjacent, to, the, north, caspian, is, the, caspian, depression, a, low, lying, region, 27, m, 89, ft, below, sea, level, the, central, asian, steppes, stretch, across, the, northeast, coast, while, the, caucasus, mountains, hug, the, western, shore, the, biomes, to, both, the, north, and, east, are, characterized, by, cold, continental, deserts, conversely, the, climate, to, the, southwest, and, south, are, generally, warm, with, uneven, elevation, due, to, a, mix, of, highlands, and, mountain, ranges, the, drastic, changes, in, climate, alongside, the, caspian, have, led, to, a, great, deal, of, biodiversity, in, the, region, the, caspian, sea, has, numerous, islands, near, the, coasts, but, none, in, the, deeper, parts, of, the, sea, ogurja, ada, is, the, largest, island, the, island, is, 37, km, 23, mi, long, with, gazelles, roaming, freely, on, it, in, the, north, caspian, the, majority, of, the, islands, are, small, and, uninhabited, like, the, tyuleniy, archipelago, an, important, bird, area, iba, the, climate, of, the, caspian, sea, is, variable, with, the, cold, desert, climate, bwk, cold, semi, arid, climate, bsk, and, humid, continental, climate, dsa, dfa, being, present, in, the, northern, portions, of, the, caspian, sea, while, the, mediterranean, climate, csa, and, humid, subtropical, climate, cfa, are, present, in, the, southern, portions, of, the, caspian, sea, the, caspian, has, characteristics, common, to, both, seas, and, lakes, it, is, often, listed, as, the, world, s, largest, lake, although, it, is, not, freshwater, the, 1, 2, salinity, classes, it, with, brackish, water, bodies, it, contains, about, 3, 5, times, as, much, water, by, volume, as, all, five, of, north, america, s, great, lakes, combined, the, volga, river, about, 80, of, the, inflow, and, the, ural, river, discharge, into, the, caspian, sea, but, it, has, no, natural, outflow, other, than, by, evaporation, thus, the, caspian, ecosystem, is, a, closed, basin, with, its, own, sea, level, history, that, is, independent, of, the, eustatic, level, of, the, world, s, oceans, the, sea, level, of, the, caspian, has, fallen, and, risen, often, rapidly, many, times, over, the, centuries, some, russian, historians, claim, that, a, medieval, rising, of, the, caspian, perhaps, caused, by, the, amu, darya, changing, its, inflow, to, the, caspian, from, the, 13th, century, to, the, 16th, century, caused, the, coastal, towns, of, khazaria, such, as, atil, to, flood, in, 2004, the, water, level, was, 28, m, 92, ft, below, sea, level, over, the, centuries, caspian, sea, levels, have, changed, in, synchrony, with, the, estimated, discharge, of, the, volga, which, in, turn, depends, on, rainfall, levels, in, its, vast, catchment, basin, precipitation, is, related, to, variations, in, the, amount, of, north, atlantic, depressions, that, reach, the, interior, and, they, in, turn, are, affected, by, cycles, of, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, thus, levels, in, the, caspian, sea, relate, to, atmospheric, conditions, in, the, north, atlantic, thousands, of, kilometres, to, the, northwest, the, last, short, term, sea, level, cycle, started, with, a, sea, level, fall, of, 3, m, 10, ft, from, 1929, to, 1977, followed, by, a, rise, of, 3, m, 10, ft, from, 1977, until, 1995, since, then, smaller, oscillations, have, taken, place, a, study, by, the, azerbaijan, academy, of, sciences, estimated, that, the, level, of, the, sea, was, dropping, by, more, than, six, centimetres, per, year, due, to, increased, evaporation, due, to, rising, temperatures, caused, by, climate, change, the, volga, river, the, longest, river, in, europe, drains, 20, of, the, european, land, area, and, is, the, source, of, 80, of, the, caspian, s, inflow, heavy, development, in, its, lower, reaches, has, caused, numerous, unregulated, releases, of, chemical, and, biological, pollutants, the, un, environment, programme, warns, that, the, caspian, suffers, from, an, enormous, burden, of, pollution, from, oil, extraction, and, refining, offshore, oil, fields, radioactive, wastes, from, nuclear, power, plants, and, huge, volumes, of, untreated, sewage, and, industrial, waste, introduced, mainly, by, the, volga, river, the, magnitude, of, fossil, fuel, extraction, and, transport, activity, in, the, caspian, also, poses, a, risk, to, the, environment, the, island, of, vulf, off, baku, for, example, has, suffered, ecological, damage, as, a, result, of, the, petrochemical, industry, this, has, significantly, decreased, the, number, of, species, of, marine, birds, in, the, area, existing, and, planned, oil, and, gas, pipelines, under, the, sea, further, increase, the, potential, threat, to, the, environment, the, high, concentration, of, mud, volcanoes, under, the, caspian, sea, were, thought, to, be, the, cause, of, a, fire, that, broke, out, 75, kilometers, from, baku, on, july, 5, 2021, the, state, oil, company, of, azerbaijan, socar, said, preliminary, information, indicated, it, was, a, mud, volcano, which, spewed, both, mud, and, flammable, gas, it, is, calculated, that, during, the, 21st, century, the, water, level, of, the, caspian, sea, will, decrease, by, 9, 18, m, 30, 60, ft, due, to, the, acceleration, of, evaporation, due, to, global, warming, and, the, process, of, desertification, causing, an, ecocide, on, october, 23, 2021, kazakhstan, president, kassym, jomart, tokayev, signed, the, protocol, for, the, protection, of, the, caspian, sea, against, pollution, from, land, based, sources, in, order, to, ensure, better, protection, for, the, biodiversity, of, the, caspian, sea, the, rising, level, of, the, caspian, sea, between, 1995, and, 1996, reduced, the, number, of, habitats, for, rare, species, of, aquatic, vegetation, this, has, been, attributed, to, a, general, lack, of, seeding, material, in, newly, formed, coastal, lagoons, and, water, bodies, many, rare, and, endemic, plant, species, of, russia, are, associated, with, the, tidal, areas, of, the, volga, delta, and, riparian, forests, of, the, samur, river, delta, the, shoreline, is, also, a, unique, refuge, for, plants, adapted, to, the, loose, sands, of, the, central, asian, deserts, the, principal, limiting, factors, to, successful, establishment, of, plant, species, are, hydrological, imbalances, within, the, surrounding, deltas, water, pollution, and, various, land, reclamation, activities, the, water, level, change, within, the, caspian, sea, is, an, indirect, reason, for, which, plants, may, not, get, established, these, affect, aquatic, plants, of, the, volga, delta, such, as, aldrovanda, vesiculosa, and, the, native, nelumbo, caspica, about, 11, plant, species, are, found, in, the, samur, river, delta, including, the, unique, liana, forests, that, date, back, to, the, tertiary, period, since, 2019, unesco, has, admitted, the, lush, hyrcanian, forests, of, mazandaran, iran, as, world, heritage, site, under, category, ix, the, caspian, turtle, mauremys, caspica, although, found, in, neighboring, areas, is, a, wholly, freshwater, species, the, zebra, mussel, is, native, to, the, caspian, and, black, sea, basins, but, has, become, an, invasive, species, elsewhere, when, introduced, the, area, has, given, its, name, to, several, species, including, the, caspian, gull, and, the, caspian, tern, the, caspian, seal, pusa, caspica, is, the, only, aquatic, mammal, endemic, to, the, caspian, sea, being, one, of, very, few, seal, species, that, live, in, inland, waters, but, it, is, different, from, those, inhabiting, freshwaters, due, to, the, hydrological, environment, of, the, sea, a, century, ago, the, caspian, was, home, to, more, than, one, million, seals, today, fewer, than, 10, remain, archeological, studies, of, gobustan, rock, art, have, identified, what, may, be, oceanic, species, including, cetaceans, from, baleen, whales, to, dolphins, and, auks, most, likely, brunnich, s, guillemot, although, the, rock, art, on, kichikdash, mountain, which, is, assumed, to, depict, either, a, beaked, whale, or, a, dolphin, it, may, represent, the, famous, beluga, sturgeon, instead, due, to, its, size, 430, cm, in, length, these, petroglyphs, may, suggest, potential, presences, of, oceanic, faunas, in, the, caspian, sea, presumably, until, the, quaternary, or, even, the, last, glacial, period, or, antiquity, due, to, historic, marine, inflow, between, the, current, caspian, sea, and, either, the, arctic, ocean, or, north, sea, or, the, black, sea, this, is, supported, by, the, existences, of, current, endemic, oceanic, species, such, as, lagoon, cockles, which, was, genetically, identified, to, originate, in, the, caspian, and, black, seas, regions, the, sea, s, basin, including, associated, waters, such, as, rivers, has, 160, native, species, and, subspecies, of, fish, in, more, than, 60, genera, about, 62, of, the, species, and, subspecies, are, endemic, as, are, 4, 6, genera, depending, on, taxonomic, treatment, the, lake, proper, has, 115, natives, including, 73, endemics, 63, 5, among, the, more, than, 50, genera, in, the, lake, proper, 3, 4, are, endemic, anatirostrum, caspiomyzon, chasar, often, included, in, ponticola, and, hyrcanogobius, by, far, the, most, numerous, families, in, the, lake, proper, are, gobies, 35, species, and, subspecies, cyprinids, 32, and, clupeids, 22, two, particularly, rich, genera, are, alosa, with, 18, endemic, species, subspecies, and, benthophilus, with, 16, endemic, species, other, examples, of, endemics, are, four, species, of, clupeonella, gobio, volgensis, two, rutilus, three, sabanejewia, stenodus, leucichthys, two, salmo, two, mesogobius, and, three, neogobius, most, non, endemic, natives, are, either, shared, with, the, black, sea, basin, or, widespread, palearctic, species, such, as, crucian, carp, prussian, carp, common, carp, common, bream, common, bleak, asp, white, bream, sunbleak, common, dace, common, roach, common, rudd, european, chub, sichel, tench, european, weatherfish, wels, catfish, northern, pike, burbot, european, perch, and, zander, almost, 30, non, indigenous, introduced, fish, species, have, been, reported, from, the, caspian, sea, but, only, a, few, have, become, established, six, sturgeon, species, the, russian, bastard, persian, sterlet, starry, and, beluga, are, native, to, the, caspian, sea, the, last, of, these, is, arguably, the, largest, freshwater, fish, in, the, world, the, sturgeon, yield, roe, eggs, that, are, processed, into, caviar, overfishing, has, depleted, a, number, of, the, historic, fisheries, in, recent, years, overfishing, has, threatened, the, sturgeon, population, to, the, point, that, environmentalists, advocate, banning, sturgeon, fishing, completely, until, the, population, recovers, the, high, price, of, sturgeon, caviar, more, than, 1, 500, azerbaijani, manats, us, 880, as, of, april, 2019, per, kilo, allows, fishermen, to, afford, bribes, to, ensure, the, authorities, look, the, other, way, making, regulations, in, many, locations, ineffective, caviar, harvesting, further, endangers, the, fish, stocks, since, it, targets, reproductive, females, reptiles, native, to, the, region, include, the, spur, thighed, tortoise, testudo, graeca, buxtoni, and, horsfield, s, tortoise, the, main, geologic, history, locally, had, two, stages, the, first, is, the, miocene, determined, by, tectonic, events, that, correlate, with, the, closing, of, the, tethys, sea, the, second, is, the, pleistocene, noted, for, its, glaciation, cycles, and, the, full, run, of, the, present, volga, during, the, first, stage, the, tethys, sea, had, evolved, into, the, sarmatian, lake, that, was, created, from, the, modern, black, sea, and, south, caspian, when, the, collision, of, the, arabian, peninsula, with, west, asia, pushed, up, the, kopet, dag, and, caucasus, mountains, lasting, south, and, west, limits, to, the, basin, this, orogenic, movement, was, continuous, while, the, caspian, was, regularly, disconnected, from, the, black, sea, in, the, late, pontian, stage, a, mountain, arch, rose, across, the, south, basin, and, divided, it, into, the, khachmaz, and, lankaran, lakes, or, early, balaxani, the, period, of, restriction, to, the, south, basin, was, reversed, during, the, akchagylian, the, lake, became, more, than, three, times, its, size, today, and, took, again, the, first, of, a, series, of, contacts, with, the, black, sea, and, aral, sea, a, recession, of, lake, akchagyl, completed, stage, one, the, earliest, hominid, remains, found, around, the, caspian, sea, are, from, dmanisi, dating, back, to, around, 1, 8, ma, and, yielded, a, number, of, skeletal, remains, of, homo, erectus, or, homo, ergaster, more, later, evidence, for, human, occupation, of, the, region, came, from, a, number, of, caves, in, georgia, and, azerbaijan, such, as, kudaro, and, azykh, caves, there, is, evidence, for, lower, palaeolithic, human, occupation, south, of, the, caspian, from, western, alburz, these, are, ganj, par, and, darband, cave, sites, neanderthal, remains, also, have, been, discovered, at, a, cave, in, georgia, discoveries, in, the, hotu, cave, and, the, adjacent, kamarband, cave, near, the, town, of, behshahr, mazandaran, south, of, the, caspian, in, iran, suggest, human, habitation, of, the, area, as, early, as, 11, 000, years, ago, ancient, greeks, focused, on, the, civilization, on, the, south, shore, they, call, it, the, h, yr, c, k, anian, sea, ancient, greek, with, sources, noting, the, latter, word, was, evolving, then, to, today, s, thelessa, late, ancient, greek, hafiz, i, abru, a, fourteenth, century, timurid, empire, geographer, recorded, that, the, destruction, of, the, oxus, river, dam, and, irrigation, works, diverted, the, river, flow, towards, the, caspian, sea, which, caused, the, aral, sea, to, nearly, disappear, later, in, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, the, sea, was, the, western, limit, of, the, chinese, empire, the, area, is, rich, in, fossil, fuels, oil, wells, were, being, dug, in, the, region, as, early, as, the, 10th, century, to, reach, oil, for, use, in, everyday, life, both, for, medicinal, purposes, and, for, heating, and, lighting, in, homes, by, the, 16th, century, europeans, were, aware, of, the, rich, oil, and, gas, deposits, locally, english, traders, thomas, bannister, and, jeffrey, duckett, described, the, area, around, baku, as, a, strange, thing, to, behold, for, there, issueth, out, of, the, ground, a, marvelous, quantity, of, oil, which, serveth, all, the, country, to, burn, in, their, houses, this, oil, is, black, and, is, called, nefte, there, is, also, by, the, town, of, baku, another, kind, of, oil, which, is, white, and, very, precious, today, oil, and, gas, platforms, abound, along, the, edges, of, the, sea, during, the, rule, of, peter, i, the, great, fedor, i, soimonov, was, a, pioneering, explorer, of, the, sea, he, was, a, hydrographer, who, charted, and, greatly, expanded, knowledge, of, the, sea, he, drew, a, set, of, four, maps, and, wrote, pilot, of, the, caspian, sea, the, first, lengthy, report, and, modern, maps, these, were, published, in, 1720, by, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, countries, in, the, caspian, region, particularly, azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and, turkmenistan, have, high, value, natural, resource, based, economies, where, the, oil, and, gas, compose, more, than, 10, percent, of, their, gdp, and, 40, percent, of, their, exports, all, the, caspian, region, economies, are, highly, dependent, on, this, type, of, mineral, wealth, the, world, energy, markets, were, influenced, by, azerbaijan, and, kazakhstan, as, they, became, strategically, crucial, in, this, sphere, thus, attracting, the, largest, share, of, foreign, direct, investment, fdi, all, of, the, countries, are, rich, in, solar, energy, and, harnessing, potential, with, the, highest, rainfall, much, less, than, the, mountains, of, central, europe, in, the, mountains, of, the, west, which, are, also, rich, in, hydroelectricity, sources, iran, has, high, fossil, fuel, energy, potential, it, has, reserves, of, 137, 5, billion, barrels, of, crude, oil, the, fourth, largest, in, the, world, producing, around, four, million, barrels, a, day, iran, has, an, estimated, 988, 4, trillion, cubic, feet, of, natural, gas, around, 16, percent, of, world, reserves, thus, key, to, current, paradigms, in, global, energy, security, russia, s, economy, ranks, as, the, twelfth, largest, by, nominal, gdp, and, sixth, largest, by, purchasing, power, parity, in, 2015, russia, s, extensive, mineral, and, energy, resources, are, the, largest, such, reserves, in, the, world, making, it, the, second, leading, producer, of, oil, and, natural, gas, globally, caspian, littoral, states, join, efforts, to, develop, infrastructure, tourism, and, trade, in, the, region, the, first, caspian, economic, forum, was, convened, on, august, 12, 2019, in, turkmenistan, and, brought, together, representatives, of, kazakhstan, russia, azerbaijan, iran, and, that, state, it, hosted, several, meetings, of,

expand, data, transmission, capabilities, in, kazakhstan, as, well, as, data, transit, capabilities, between, asia, and, europe, the, project, generated, interest, from, investors, from, all, over, the, world, including, the, uk, the, caspian, sea, region, presently, is, a, significant, but, not, major, supplier, of, crude, oil, to, world, markets, based, upon, estimates, by, bp, amoco, and, the, u, s, energy, information, administration, u, s, department, of, energy, the, region, output, about, 1, 4, 1, 5, million, barrels, per, day, plus, natural, gas, liquids, in, 2001, 1, 9, of, total, world, output, more, than, a, dozen, countries, output, more, than, this, top, figure, caspian, region, production, has, been, higher, but, waned, during, and, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, kazakhstan, accounts, for, 55, and, azerbaijan, for, about, 20, of, the, states, oil, output, the, world, s, first, offshore, wells, and, machine, drilled, wells, were, made, in, bibi, heybat, bay, near, baku, azerbaijan, in, 1873, exploration, and, development, of, oil, began, in, some, of, the, largest, fields, known, to, exist, in, the, world, at, that, time, on, the, absheron, peninsula, near, the, villages, of, balakhanli, sabunchi, ramana, and, bibi, heybat, total, recoverable, reserves, were, more, than, 500, million, tons, by, 1900, baku, had, more, than, 3, 000, oil, wells, 2, 000, of, which, were, producing, at, industrial, levels, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, baku, became, known, as, the, black, gold, capital, and, many, skilled, workers, and, specialists, flocked, to, the, city, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, baku, was, the, center, of, the, international, oil, industry, in, 1920, when, the, bolsheviks, captured, azerbaijan, all, private, property, including, oil, wells, and, factories, was, confiscated, rapidly, the, republic, s, oil, industry, came, under, the, control, of, the, soviet, union, by, 1941, azerbaijan, was, producing, a, record, 23, 5, million, tons, of, oil, per, year, its, baku, region, output, was, nearly, 72, percent, of, the, soviet, union, s, oil, in, 1994, the, contract, of, the, century, was, signed, heralding, extra, regional, development, of, the, baku, oil, fields, the, large, baku, tbilisi, ceyhan, pipeline, conveys, azeri, oil, to, the, turkish, mediterranean, port, of, ceyhan, and, opened, in, 2006, the, vladimir, filanovsky, oil, field, in, the, russian, section, of, the, body, of, water, was, discovered, in, 2005, it, is, reportedly, the, largest, found, in, 25, years, it, was, announced, in, october, 2016, that, lukoil, would, start, production, from, it, baku, has, the, main, moorings, of, all, large, vessels, such, as, oil, tankers, in, azerbaijan, it, is, the, largest, port, of, the, caspian, sea, the, port, and, tankers, have, access, to, the, oceans, along, the, caspian, sea, volga, don, canal, and, the, don, sea, of, azov, a, northern, alternate, is, the, volga, baltic, a, sea, which, has, a, connection, to, the, north, sea, of, the, atlantic, as, the, white, sea, does, via, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, baku, sea, trade, port, and, caspian, shipping, company, cjsc, have, a, big, role, in, the, sea, transportation, of, azerbaijan, the, caspian, sea, shipping, company, cjsc, has, two, fleets, plus, shipyards, its, transport, fleet, has,

passengers, in, the, trans, caspian, direction, also, performs, work, to, fully, ensure, the, processes, of, oil, and, gas, production, at, sea, in, the, 19th, century, the, sharp, increase, in, oil, production, in, baku, gave, a, huge, impetus, to, the, development, of, shipping, in, the, caspian, sea, and, as, a, result, there, was, a, need, to, create, fundamentally, new, floating, facilities, for, the, transportation, of, oil, and, oil, products, many, of, the, islands, along, the, azerbaijani, coast, retain, great, geopolitical, and, economic, importance, for, demarcation, line, oil, fields, relying, on, their, national, status, bulla, island, pirallah, island, and, nargin, which, is, still, used, as, a, former, soviet, base, and, is, the, largest, island, in, the, baku, bay, hold, oil, reserves, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, allowed, the, market, opening, of, the, region, this, led, to, intense, investment, and, development, by, international, oil, companies, in, 1998, dick, cheney, commented, that, i, can, t, think, of, a, time, when, we, ve, had, a, region, emerge, as, suddenly, to, become, as, strategically, significant, as, the, caspian, a, key, problem, to, further, local, development, is, arriving, at, precise, agreed, demarcation, lines, among, the, five, littoral, states, the, current, disputes, along, azerbaijan, s, maritime, borders, with, turkmenistan, and, iran, could, impinge, future, development, much, controversy, currently, exists, over, the, proposed, trans, caspian, oil, and, gas, pipelines, these, projects, would, allow, western, markets, easier, access, to, kazakh, oil, and, potentially, uzbek, and, turkmen, gas, as, well, russia, officially, opposes, the, project, on, environmental, grounds, however, analysts, note, that, the, pipelines, would, bypass, russia, completely, thereby, denying, the, country, valuable, transit, fees, as, well, as, destroying, its, current, monopoly, on, westward, bound, hydrocarbon, exports, from, the, region, recently, both, kazakhstan, and, turkmenistan, have, expressed, their, support, for, the, trans, caspian, pipeline, leaked, u, s, diplomatic, cables, revealed, that, bp, covered, up, a, gas, leak, and, blowout, incident, in, september, 2008, at, an, operating, gas, field, in, the, azeri, chirag, guneshi, area, of, the, azerbaijan, caspian, sea, five, states, are, located, along, about, 4, 800, km, 3, 000, mi, of, caspian, coastline, the, length, of, the, coastline, of, these, countries, in, 2000, negotiations, as, to, the, demarcation, of, the, sea, had, been, going, on, for, nearly, a, decade, among, all, the, states, bordering, it, whether, it, was, by, law, a, sea, a, lake, or, an, agreed, hybrid, the, decision, would, set, the, demarcation, rules, and, was, heavily, debated, access, to, mineral, resources, oil, and, natural, gas, access, for, fishing, and, access, to, international, waters, through, russia, s, volga, river, and, the, canals, connecting, it, to, the, black, sea, and, baltic, sea, all, rest, on, the, negotiations, outcome, access, to, the, volga, is, key, for, market, efficiency, and, economic, diversity, of, the, landlocked, states, of, azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and, turkmenistan, this, concerns, russia, as, more, traffic, seeks, to, use, and, at, some, points, congest, its, inland, waterways, if, the, body, of, water, is, by, law, a, sea, many, precedents, and, international, treaties, oblige, free, access, to, foreign, vessels, if, it, is, a, lake, there, are, no, such, obligations, resolving, and, improving, some, environmental, issues, properly, rests, on, the, status, and, borders, issue, all, five, caspian, littoral, states, maintain, naval, forces, on, the, sea, according, to, a, treaty, signed, between, iran, and, the, soviet, union, the, sea, is, technically, a, lake, and, was, divided, into, two, sectors, iranian, and, soviet, but, the, resources, then, mainly, fish, were, commonly, shared, the, line, between, the, two, sectors, was, considered, an, international, border, in, a, common, lake, like, lake, albert, the, soviet, sector, was, sub, divided, into, the, four, littoral, republics, administrative, sectors, russia, kazakhstan, and, azerbaijan, have, bilateral, agreements, with, each, other, based, on, median, lines, because, of, their, use, by, the, three, nations, median, lines, seem, to, be, the, most, likely, method, of, delineating, territory, in, future, agreements, however, iran, insists, on, a, single, multilateral, agreement, among, the, five, nations, aiming, for, a, one, fifth, share, azerbaijan, is, at, odds, with, iran, over, some, of, the, sea, s, oil, fields, occasionally, iranian, patrol, boats, have, fired, at, vessels, sent, by, azerbaijan, for, exploration, into, the, disputed, region, there, are, similar, tensions, between, azerbaijan, and, turkmenistan, the, latter, claims, that, the, former, has, pumped, more, oil, than, agreed, from, a, field, recognized, by, both, parties, as, shared, the, caspian, littoral, states, meeting, in, 2007, signed, an, accord, that, only, allows, littoral, state, flag, bearing, ships, to, enter, the, sea, negotiations, among, the, five, states, ebbed, and, flowed, from, about, 1990, to, 2018, progress, was, notable, in, the, fourth, caspian, summit, held, in, astrakhan, in, 2014, the, caspian, summit, is, a, head, of, state, level, meeting, of, the, five, littoral, states, the, fifth, caspian, summit, took, place, on, august, 12, 2018, in, the, kazakh, port, city, of, aktau, the, five, leaders, signed, the, convention, on, the, legal, status, of, the, caspian, sea, representatives, of, the, caspian, littoral, states, held, a, meeting, in, the, capital, of, kazakhstan, on, september, 28, 2018, as, a, follow, up, to, the, aktau, summit, the, conference, was, hosted, by, the, kazakh, ministry, of, investment, and, development, the, participants, in, the, meeting, agreed, to, host, an, investment, forum, for, the, caspian, region, every, two, years, the, five, littoral, states, build, consensus, on, legally, binding, governance, of, the, caspian, sea, through, special, working, groups, of, a, convention, on, the, legal, status, of, the, caspian, sea, in, advance, of, a, caspian, summit, the, 51st, special, working, group, took, place, in, astana, in, may, 2018, and, found, consensus, on, multiple, agreements, agreements, on, cooperation, in, the, field, of, transport, trade, and, economic, cooperation, prevention, of, incidents, on, the, sea, combating, terrorism, fighting, against, organized, crime, and, border, security, cooperation, the, convention, grants, jurisdiction, over, 24, km, 15, mi, of, territorial, waters, to, each, neighboring, country, plus, an, additional, 16, km, 10, mi, of, exclusive, fishing, rights, on, the, surface, while, the, rest, is, international, waters, the, seabed, on, the, other, hand, remains, undefined, subject, to, bilateral, agreements, between, countries, thus, the, caspian, sea, is, legally, neither, fully, a, sea, nor, a, lake, while, the, convention, addresses, caviar, production, oil, and, gas, extraction, and, military, uses, it, does, not, touch, on, environmental, issues, unece, recognizes, several, rivers, that, cross, international, borders, which, flow, into, the, caspian, sea, these, are, although, the, caspian, sea, is, endorheic, its, main, tributary, the, volga, is, connected, by, important, shipping, canals, with, the, don, river, and, thus, the, black, sea, and, with, the, baltic, sea, with, branch, canals, to, northern, dvina, and, to, the, white, sea, another, caspian, tributary, the, kuma, river, is, connected, by, an, irrigation, canal, with, the, don, basin, as, well, scheduled, ferry, services, including, train, ferries, across, the, sea, chiefly, are, between, as, an, endorheic, basin, the, caspian, sea, basin, has, no, natural, connection, with, the, ocean, since, the, medieval, period, traders, reached, the, caspian, via, a, number, of, portages, that, connected, the, volga, and, its, tributaries, with, the, don, river, which, flows, into, the, sea, of, azov, and, various, rivers, that, flow, into, the, baltic, sea, primitive, canals, connecting, the, volga, basin, with, the, baltic, were, constructed, as, early, as, the, early, 18th, century, since, then, a, number, of, canal, projects, have, been, completed, the, two, modern, canal, systems, that, connect, the, volga, basin, and, hence, the, caspian, sea, with, the, ocean, are, the, volga, baltic, waterway, and, the, volga, don, canal, the, proposed, pechora, kama, canal, was, a, project, that, was, widely, discussed, between, the, 1930s, and, 1980s, shipping, was, a, secondary, consideration, its, main, goal, was, to, redirect, some, of, the, water, of, the, pechora, river, which, flows, into, the, arctic, ocean, via, the, kama, river, into, the, volga, the, goals, were, both, irrigation, and, the, stabilization, of, the, water, level, in, the, caspian, which, was, thought, to, be, falling, dangerously, fast, at, the, time, during, 1971, some, peaceful, nuclear, construction, experiments, were, carried, out, in, the, region, by, the, u, s, s, r, in, june, 2007, in, order, to, boost, his, oil, rich, country, s, access, to, markets, kazakhstan, s, president, nursultan, nazarbayev, proposed, a, 700, km, 435, mi, link, between, the, caspian, sea, and, the, black, sea, it, is, hoped, that, the, eurasia, canal, manych, ship, canal, would, transform, landlocked, kazakhstan, and, other, central, asian, countries, into, maritime, states, enabling, them, to, significantly, increase, trade, volume, although, the, canal, would, traverse, russian, territory, it, would, benefit, kazakhstan, through, its, caspian, sea, ports, the, most, likely, route, for, the, canal, the, officials, at, the, committee, on, water, resources, at, kazakhstan, s, agriculture, ministry, say, would, follow, the, kuma, manych, depression, where, currently, a, chain, of, rivers, and, lakes, is, already, connected, by, an, irrigation, canal, the, kuma, manych, canal, upgrading, the, volga, don, canal, would, be, another, option
