1824, as, a, division, of, the, former, territory, of, the, royal, audience, of, quito, quito, which, remained, the, capital, of, the, department, and, republic, is, located, only, about, 40, kilometers, 25, mi, 1, 4, of, a, degree, south, of, the, equator, various, peoples, had, settled, in, the, area, of, future, ecuador, before, the, arrival, of, the, incas, the, archeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, paleo, indians, first, dispersal, into, the, americas, occurred, near, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, around, 16, 500, 13, 000, years, ago, the, first, people, who, reached, ecuador, may, have, journeyed, by, land, from, north, and, central, america, or, by, boat, down, the, pacific, ocean, coastline, even, though, their, languages, were, unrelated, these, groups, developed, similar, groups, of, cultures, each, based, in, different, environments, the, people, of, the, coast, combined, agriculture, with, fishing, hunting, and, gathering, the, people, of, the, highland, andes, developed, a, sedentary, agricultural, way, of, life, and, peoples, of, the, amazon, basin, relied, on, hunting, and, gathering, in, some, cases, this, is, combined, with, agriculture, and, arboriculture, many, civilizations, arose, in, ecuador, such, as, the, valdivia, culture, and, machalilla, culture, on, the, coast, the, quitus, near, present, day, quito, and, the, ca, ari, near, present, day, cuenca, in, the, highland, andes, mountains, where, life, was, more, sedentary, groups, of, tribes, cooperated, and, formed, villages, thus, the, first, nations, based, on, agricultural, resources, and, the, domestication, of, animals, formed, eventually, through, wars, and, marriage, alliances, of, their, leaders, groups, of, nations, formed, confederations, when, the, incas, arrived, they, found, that, these, confederations, were, so, developed, that, it, took, the, incas, two, generations, of, rulers, topa, inca, yupanqui, and, huayna, capac, to, absorb, them, into, the, inca, empire, people, belonging, to, the, confederations, that, gave, them, the, most, problems, were, deported, to, distant, areas, of, peru, bolivia, and, north, argentina, similarly, a, number, of, loyal, inca, subjects, from, peru, and, bolivia, were, brought, to, ecuador, to, prevent, rebellion, thus, the, region, of, highland, ecuador, became, part, of, the, inca, empire, in, 1463, sharing, the, same, language, in, contrast, when, the, incas, made, incursions, into, coastal, ecuador, and, the, eastern, amazon, jungles, of, ecuador, they, found, both, the, environment, and, indigenous, people, more, hostile, moreover, when, the, incas, tried, to, subdue, them, these, indigenous, people, withdrew, to, the, interior, and, resorted, to, guerrilla, tactics, as, a, result, inca, expansion, into, the, amazon, basin, and, the, pacific, coast, of, ecuador, was, hampered, the, indigenous, people, of, the, amazon, jungle, and, coastal, ecuador, remained, relatively, autonomous, until, the, spanish, soldiers, and, missionaries, arrived, in, force, the, amazonian, people, and, the, cayapas, of, coastal, ecuador, were, the, only, groups, to, resist, both, inca, and, spanish, domination, maintaining, their, languages, and, cultures, well, into, the, 21st, century, before, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, the, inca, empire, was, involved, in, a, civil, war, the, untimely, death, of, both, the, heir, ninan, cuyochi, and, the, emperor, huayna, capac, from, a, european, disease, that, spread, into, ecuador, created, a, power, vacuum, between, two, factions, and, led, to, a, civil, war, the, army, stationed, north, headed, by, atahualpa, marched, south, to, cuzco, and, massacred, the, royal, family, associated, with, his, brother, in, 1532, a, small, band, of, spaniards, headed, by, francisco, pizarro, reached, cajamarca, and, lured, atahualpa, into, a, trap, battle, of, cajamarca, pizarro, promised, to, release, atahualpa, if, he, made, good, his, promise, of, filling, a, room, full, of, gold, but, after, a, mock, trial, the, spaniards, executed, atahualpa, by, strangulation, new, infectious, diseases, such, as, smallpox, endemic,

however, bol, var, s, intention, was, to, form, a, new, republic, known, as, the, gran, colombia, out, of, the, liberated, spanish, territory, of, new, granada, which, consisted, of, colombia, venezuela, and, ecuador, san, mart, n, s, plans, were, thwarted, when, bol, var, descended, from, the, andes, mountains, and, occupied, guayaquil, they, also, annexed, the, newly, liberated,

southern, andes, mountain, region, where, the, mara, on, cuts, across, ecuador, had, claims, to, an, area, it, called, ja, n, de, bracamoros, these, areas, were, included, as, part, of, the, territory, of, gran, colombia, by, bolivar, on, 17, december, 1819, during, the, congress, of, angostura, when, the, republic, of, gran, colombia, was, created, tumbes, declared, itself, independent, from, spain, on, 17, january, 1821, and, ja, n, de, bracamoros, on, 17, june, 1821, without, any, outside, help, from, revolutionary, armies, however, that, same, year, peruvian, forces, participating, in, the, trujillo, revolution, occupied, both, ja, n, and, tumbes, peruvian, generals, without, any, legal, titles, backing, them, up, and, with, ecuador, still, federated, with, the, gran, colombia, had, the, desire, to, annex, ecuador, to, the, republic, of, peru, at, the, expense, of, the, gran, colombia, feeling, that, ecuador, was, once, part, of, the, inca, empire, on, 28, july, 1821, peruvian, independence, was, proclaimed, in, lima, by, san, mart, n, and, tumbes, and, ja, n, which, were, included, as, part, of, the, revolution, of, trujillo, by, the, peruvian, occupying, force, had, the, whole, region, swear, allegiance, to, the, new, peruvian, flag, and, incorporated, itself, into, peru, gran, colombia, had, always, protested, peru, for, the, return, of, ja, n, and, tumbes, for, almost, a, decade, then, finally, bolivar, after, long, and, futile, discussion, over, the, return, of, ja, n, tumbes, and, part, of, mainas, declared, war, president, and, general, jos, de, la, mar, who, was, born, in, ecuador, believing, his, opportunity, had, come, to, annex, the, district, of, ecuador, to, peru, personally, with, a, peruvian, force, invaded, and, occupied, guayaquil, and, a, few, cities, in, the, loja, region, of, southern, ecuador, on, 28, november, 1828, the, war, ended, when, an, outnumbered, southern, gran, colombian, army, at, battle, of, tarqui, on, 27, february, 1829, led, by, antonio, jos, de, sucre, defeated, the, peruvian, invasion, force, led, by, president, la, mar, this, defeat, led, to, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, guayaquil, in, september, 1829, whereby, peru, and, its, congress, recognized, gran, colombian, rights, over, tumbes, ja, n, and, maynas, through, meetings, between, peru, and, gran, colombia, the, border, was, set, as, tumbes, river, in, the, west, and, in, the, east, the, maranon, and, amazon, rivers, were, to, be, followed, toward, brazil, as, the, most, natural, borders, between, them, according, to, the, peace, negotiations, peru, agreed, to, return, guayaquil, tumbez, and, ja, n, despite, this, peru, returned, guayaquil, but, failed, to, return, tumbes, and, ja, n, alleging, that, it, was, not, obligated, to, follow, the, agreements, since, the, gran, colombia, ceased, to, exist, when, it, divided, itself, into, three, different, nations, ecuador, colombia, and, venezuela, the, central, district, of, the, gran, colombia, known, as, cundinamarca, or, new, granada, modern, colombia, with, its, capital, in, bogota, did, not, recognize, the, separation, of, the, southern, district, of, the, gran, colombia, with, its, capital, in, quito, from, the, gran, colombian, federation, on, 13, may, 1830, after, ecuador, s, separation, the, department, of, cauca, voluntarily, decided, to, unite, itself, with, ecuador, due, to, instability, in, the, central, government, of, bogota, the, venezuelan, born, president, of, ecuador, the, general, juan, jos, flores, with, the, approval, of, the, ecuadorian, congress, annexed, the, department, of, cauca, on, 20, december, 1830, since, the, government, of, cauca, had, called, for, union, with, the, district, of, the, south, as, far, back, as, april, 1830, moreover, the, cauca, region, throughout, its, long, history, had, very, strong, economic, and, cultural, ties, with, the, people, of, ecuador, also, the, cauca, region, which, included, such, cities, as, pasto, popay, n, and, buenaventura, had, always, been, dependent, on, the, presidencia, or, audiencia, of, quito, fruitless, negotiations, continued, between, the, governments, of, bogot, and, quito, where, the, government, of, bogot, did, not, recognize, the, separation, of, ecuador, or, that, of, cauca, from, the, gran, colombia, until, war, broke, out, in, may, 1832, in, five, months, new, granada, defeated, ecuador, due, to, the, fact, that, the, majority, of, the, ecuadorian, armed, forces, were, composed, of, rebellious, angry, unpaid, veterans, from, venezuela, and, colombia, that, did, not, want, to, fight, against, their, fellow, countrymen, seeing, that, his, officers, were, rebelling, mutinying, and, changing, sides, president, flores, had, no, option, but, to, reluctantly, make, peace, with, new, granada, the, treaty, of, pasto, of, 1832, was, signed, by, which, the, department, of, cauca, was, turned, over, to, new, granada, modern, colombia, the, government, of, bogot, recognized, ecuador, as, an, independent, country, and, the, border, was, to, follow, the, ley, de, divisi, n, territorial, de, la, rep, blica, de, colombia, law, of, the, division, of, territory, of, the, gran, colombia, passed, on, 25, june, 1824, this, law, set, the, border, at, the, river, carchi, and, the, eastern, border, that, stretched, to, brazil, at, the, caquet, river, later, ecuador, contended, that, the, republic, of, colombia, while, reorganizing, its, government, unlawfully, made, its, eastern, border, provisional, and, that, colombia, extended, its, claims, south, to, the, napo, river, because, it, said, that, the, government, of, popay, n, extended, its, control, all, the, way, to, the, napo, river, when, ecuador, seceded, from, the, gran, colombia, peru, contested, ecuador, s, claims, with, the, newly, discovered, real, cedula, of, 1802, by, which, peru, claims, the, king, of, spain, had, transferred, these, lands, from, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, to, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, during, colonial, times, this, was, to, halt, the, ever, expanding, portuguese, settlements, into, spanish, domains, which, were, left, vacant, and, in, disorder, after, the, expulsion, of, jesuit, missionaries, from, their, bases, along, the, amazon, basin, ecuador, countered, by, labeling, the, cedula, of, 1802, an, ecclesiastical, instrument, which, had, nothing, to, do, with, political, borders, peru, began, its, de, facto, occupation, of, disputed, amazonian, territories, after, it, signed, a, secret, 1851, peace, treaty, in, favor, of, brazil, this, treaty, disregarded, spanish, rights, that, were, confirmed, during, colonial, times, by, a, spanish, portuguese, treaty, over, the, amazon, regarding, territories, held, by, illegal, portuguese, settlers, peru, began, occupying, the, missionary, villages, in, the, mainas, or, maynas, region, which, it, began, calling, loreto, with, its, capital, in, iquitos, during, its, negotiations, with, brazil, peru, claimed, amazonian, basin, territories, up, to, caqueta, river, in, the, north, and, toward, the, andes, mountain, range, colombia, protested, stating, that, its, claims, extended, south, toward, the, napo, and, amazon, rivers, ecuador, protested, that, it, claimed, the, amazon, basin, between, the, caqueta, river, and, the, mara, on, amazon, river, peru, ignored, these, protests, and, created, the, department, of, loreto, in, 1853, with, its, capital, in, iquitos, peru, briefly, occupied, guayaquil, again, in, 1860, since, peru, thought, that, ecuador, was, selling, some, of, the, disputed, land, for, development, to, british, bond, holders, but, returned, guayaquil, after, a, few, months, the, border, dispute, was, then, submitted, to, spain, for, arbitration, from, 1880, to, 1910, but, to, no, avail, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, ecuador, made, an, effort, to, peacefully, define, its, eastern, amazonian, borders, with, its, neighbours, through, negotiation, on, 6, may, 1904, ecuador, signed, the, tobar, rio, branco, treaty, recognizing, brazil, s, claims, to, the, amazon, in, recognition, of, ecuador, s, claim, to, be, an, amazonian, country, to, counter, peru, s, earlier, treaty, with, brazil, back, on, 23, october, 1851, then, after, a, few, meetings, with, the, colombian, government, s, representatives, an, agreement, was, reached, and, the, mu, oz, vernaza, suarez, treaty, was, signed, 15, july, 1916, in, which, colombian, rights, to, the, putumayo, river, were, recognized, as, well, as, ecuador, s, rights, to, the, napo, river, and, the, new, border, was, a, line, that, ran, midpoint, between, those, two, rivers, in, this, way, ecuador, gave, up, the, claims, it, had, to, the, amazonian, territories, between, the, caquet, river, and, napo, river, to, colombia, thus, cutting, itself, off, from, brazil, later, a, brief, war, erupted, between, colombia, and, peru, over, peru, s, claims, to, the, caquet, region, which, ended, with, peru, reluctantly, signing, the, salomon, lozano, treaty, on, 24, march, 1922, ecuador, protested, this, secret, treaty, since, colombia, gave, away, ecuadorian, claimed, land, to, peru, that, ecuador, had, given, to, colombia, in, 1916, on, 21, july, 1924, the, ponce, castro, oyanguren, protocol, was, signed, between, ecuador, and, peru, where, both, agreed, to, hold, direct, negotiations, and, to, resolve, the, dispute, in, an, equitable, manner, and, to, submit, the, differing, points, of, the, dispute, to, the, united, states, for, arbitration, negotiations, between, the, ecuadorian, and, peruvian, representatives, began, in, washington, on, 30, september, 1935, the, negotiations, turned, into, arguments, during, the, next, 7, months, and, finally, on, 29, september, 1937, the, peruvian, representatives, decided, to, break, off, the, negotiations, in, 1941, amid, fast, growing, tensions, within, disputed, territories, around, the, zarumilla, river, war, broke, out, with, peru, peru, claimed, that, ecuador, s, military, presence, in, peruvian, claimed, territory, was, an, invasion, ecuador, for, its, part, claimed, that, peru, had, recently, invaded, ecuador, around, the, zarumilla, river, and, that, peru, since, ecuador, s, independence, from, spain, has, systematically, occupied, tumbez, ja, n, and, most, of, the, disputed, territories, in, the, amazonian, basin, between, the, putomayo, and, mara, on, rivers, in, july, 1941, troops, were, mobilized, in, both, countries, peru, had, an, army, of, 11, 681, troops, who, faced, a, poorly, supplied, and, inadequately, armed, ecuadorian, force, of, 2, 300, of, which, only, 1, 300, were, deployed, in, the, southern, provinces, hostilities, erupted, on, 5, july, 1941, when, peruvian, forces, crossed, the, zarumilla, river, at, several, locations, testing, the, strength, and, resolve, of, the, ecuadorian, border, troops, finally, on, 23, july, 1941, the, peruvians, launched, a, major, invasion, crossing, the, zarumilla, river, in, force, and, advancing, into, the, ecuadorian, province, of,
