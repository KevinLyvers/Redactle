and, became, known, as, maroons, one, maroon, leader, fran, ois, mackandal, led, a, rebellion, in, the, 1750s, however, he, was, later, captured, and, executed, by, the, french, inspired, by, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, and, principles, of, the, rights, of, man, the, french, settlers, and, free, people, of, color, pressed, for, greater, political, freedom, and, more, civil, rights,

an, opportunity, in, august, 1791, the, first, slave, armies, were, established, in, northern, haiti, under, the, leadership, of, toussaint, louverture, inspired, by, the, vodou, houngan, priest, boukman, and, backed, by, the, spanish, in, santo, domingo, soon, a, full, blown, slave, rebellion, had, broken, out, across, the, entire, colony, in, 1792, the, french, government, sent, three,

the, french, colonies, the, united, states, which, was, a, new, republic, itself, oscillated, between, supporting, or, not, supporting, toussaint, louverture, and, the, emerging, country, of, haiti, depending, on, who, was, president, of, the, us, washington, who, was, a, slave, holder, and, isolationist, kept, the, united, states, neutral, although, private, us, citizens, at, times, provided, aid, to, french, planters, trying, to, put, down, the, revolt, john, adams, a, vocal, opponent, of, slavery, fully, supported, the, slave, revolt, by, providing, diplomatic, recognition, financial, support, munitions, and, warships, including, the, uss, constitution, beginning, in, 1798, this, support, ended, in, 1801, when, jefferson, another, slave, holding, president, took, office, and, recalled, the, us, navy, with, slavery, abolished, toussaint, louverture, pledged, allegiance, to, france, and, he, fought, off, the, british, and, spanish, forces, who, had, taken, advantage, of,

the, island, under, one, government, however, an, insurgency, against, french, rule, broke, out, in, the, east, and, in, the, west, there, was, fighting, between, louverture, s, forces, and, the,

control, the, french, achieved, some, victories, but, within, a, few, months, most, of, their, army, had, died, from, yellow, fever, ultimately, more, than, 50, 000, french, troops, died, in, an, attempt, to, retake, the, colony, including, 18, generals, the, french, managed, to, capture, louverture, transporting, him, to, france, for, trial, he, was, imprisoned, at, fort, de, joux, where, he, died, in, 1803, of, exposure, and, possibly, tuberculosis, the, enslaved, persons, along, with, free, gens, de, couleur, and, allies, continued, their, fight, for, independence, led, by, generals, jean, jacques, dessalines, alexandre, p, tion, and, henry, christophe, the, rebels, finally, managed, to, decisively, defeat, the, french, troops, at, the, battle, of, verti, res, on, 18, november, 1803, establishing, the, first, nation, ever, to, successfully, gain, independence, through, a, slave, revolt, under, the, overall, command, of, dessalines, the, haitian, armies, avoided, open, battle, and, instead, conducted, a, successful, guerrilla, campaign, against, the, napoleonic, forces, working, with, diseases, such, as, yellow, fever, to, reduce, the, numbers, of, french, soldiers, later, that, year, france, withdrew, its, remaining, 7, 000, troops, from, the, island, and, napoleon, gave, up, his, idea, of, re, establishing, a, north, american, empire, selling, louisiana, new, france, to, the, united, states, in, the, louisiana, purchase, throughout, the, revolution, an, estimated, 20, 000, french, troops, succumbed, to, yellow, fever, while, another, 37, 000, were, killed, in, action, exceeding, the, total, french, soldiers, killed, in, action, across, various, 19th, century, colonial, campaigns, in, algeria, mexico, indochina, tunisia, and, west, africa, which,

colonists, invited, to, the, north, west, region, and, a, group, of, medical, doctors, and, professionals, reportedly, people, with, connections, to, officers, in, the, haitian, army, were, also, spared, as, well, as, the, women, who, agreed, to, marry, non, white, men, fearful, of, the, potential, impact, the, slave, rebellion, could, have, in, the, slave, states, u, s, president, thomas, jefferson, refused, to, recognize, the, new, republic, the, southern, politicians, who, were, a, powerful, voting, bloc, in, the, american, congress, prevented, u, s, recognition, for, decades, until, they, withdrew, in, 1861, to, form, the, confederacy, the, revolution, led, to, a, wave, of, emigration, in, 1809, 9, 000, refugees, from, saint, domingue, both, white, planters, and, people, of,

arrived, enslaved, persons, added, to, the, city, s, african, population, the, plantation, system, was, re, established, in, haiti, albeit, for, wages, however, many, haitians, were, marginalized, and, resented, the, heavy, handed, manner, in, which, this, was, enforced, in, the, new, nation, s, politics, the, rebel, movement, splintered, and, dessalines, was, assassinated, by, rivals, on, 17, october, 1806, after, dessalines, death, haiti, became, split, into, two, with, the, kingdom, of, haiti, in, the, north, directed, by, henri, christophe, later, declaring, himself, henri, i, and, a, republic, in, the, south, centered, on, port, au, prince, directed, by, alexandre, p, tion, an, homme, de, couleur, christophe, established, a, semi, feudal, corv, e, system, with, a, rigid,

military, and, financial, assistance, to, the, revolutionary, leader, sim, n, bol, var, which, were, critical, in, enabling, him, to, liberate, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, meanwhile, the, french, who, had, managed, to, maintain, a, precarious, control, of, eastern, hispaniola, were, defeated, by, insurgents, led, by, juan, s, nchez, ram, rez, with, the, area, returning, to, spanish, rule, in, 1809, following, the, battle, of, palo, hincado, beginning, in, 1821, president, jean, pierre, boyer, also, an, homme, de, couleur, and, successor, to, p, tion, reunified, the, island, following, the, suicide, of, henry, christophe, after, santo, domingo, declared, its, independence, from, spain, on, 30, november, 1821, boyer, invaded, seeking, to, unite, the, entire, island, by, force, and, ending, slavery, in, santo, domingo, struggling, to, revive, the, agricultural, economy, to, produce, commodity, crops, boyer, passed, the, code, rural, which, denied, peasant, laborers, the, right, to, leave, the, land, enter, the, towns, or, start, farms, or, shops, of, their, own, causing, much, resentment, as, most, peasants, wished, to, have, their, own, farms, rather, than, work, on, plantations, starting, in, september, 1824, more, than, 6, 000, african, americans, migrated, to, haiti, with, transportation, paid, by, an, american, philanthropic, group, similar, in, function, to, the, american, colonization, society, and, its, efforts, in, liberia, many, found, the, conditions, too, harsh, and, returned, to, the, united, states, in, july, 1825, king, charles, x, of, france, during, a, period, of, restoration, of, the, french, monarchy, sent, a, fleet, to, reconquer, haiti, under, pressure, president, boyer, agreed, to, a, treaty, by, which, france, formally, recognized, the, independence, of, the, nation, in, exchange, for, a, payment, of, 150, million, francs, by, an, order, of, 17, april, 1826, the, king, of, france, renounced, his, rights, of, sovereignty, and, formally, recognized, the, independence, of, haiti, the, enforced, payments, to, france, hampered, haiti, s, economic, growth, for, years, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, many, western, nations, continued, to, refuse, formal, diplomatic, recognition, to, haiti, britain, recognized, haitian, independence, in, 1833, and, the, united, states, not, until, 1862, haiti, borrowed, heavily, from, western, banks, at, extremely, high, interest, rates, to, repay, the, debt, although, the, amount, of, the, reparations, was, reduced, to, 90, million, in, 1838, by, 1900, 80, of, haiti, s, government, spending, was, debt, repayment, and, the, country, did, not, finish, repaying, it, until, 1947, after, losing, the, support, of, haiti, s, elite, boyer, was, ousted, in, 1843, with, charles, rivi, re, h, rard, replacing, him, as, president, nationalist, dominican, forces, in, eastern, hispaniola, led, by, juan, pablo, duarte, seized, control, of, santo, domingo, on, 27, february, 1844, the, haitian, forces, unprepared, for, a, significant, uprising, capitulated, to, the, rebels, effectively, ending, haitian, rule, of, eastern, hispaniola, in, march, rivi, re, h, rard, attempted, to, reimpose, his, authority, but, the, dominicans, inflicted, heavy, losses, rivi, re, h, rard, was, removed, from, office, by, the, mulatto, hierarchy, and, replaced, with, the, aged, general, philippe, guerrier, who, assumed, the, presidency, on, 3, may, 1844, guerrier, died, in, april, 1845, and, was, succeeded, by, general, jean, louis, pierrot, pierrot, s, most, pressing, duty, as, the, new, president, was, to, check, the, incursions, of, the, dominicans, who, were, harassing, the, haitian, troops, dominican, gunboats, were, also, making, depredations, on, haiti, s, coasts, president, pierrot, decided, to, open, a, campaign, against, the, dominicans, whom, he, considered, merely, as, insurgents, however, the, haitian, offensive, of, 1845, was, stopped, on, the, frontier, on, 1, january, 1846, pierrot, announced, a, fresh, campaign, to, reimpose, haitian, suzerainty, over, eastern, hispaniola, but, his, officers, and, men, greeted, this, fresh, summons, with, contempt, thus, a, month, later, february, 1846, when, pierrot, ordered, his, troops, to, march, against, the, dominicans, the, haitian, army, mutinied, and, its, soldiers, proclaimed, his, overthrow, as, president, of, the, republic, with, the, war, against, the, dominicans, having, become, very, unpopular, in, haiti, it, was, beyond, the, power, of, the, new, president, general, jean, baptiste, rich, to, stage, another, invasion, on, 27, february, 1847, president, rich, died, after, only, a, year, in, power, and, was, replaced, by, an, obscure, officer, general, faustin, soulouque, during, the, first, two, years, of, soulouque, s, administration, the, conspiracies, and, opposition, he, faced, in, retaining, power, were, so, manifold, that, the, dominicans, were, given, a, further, breathing, space, in, which, to, consolidate, their, independence, but, when, in, 1848, france, finally, recognized, the, dominican, republic, as, a, free, and, independent, state, and, provisionally,

the, monroe, doctrine, in, december, 1914, the, americans, removed, 500, 000, from, the, haitian, national, bank, but, rather, than, seize, it, to, help, pay, the, debt, it, was, removed, for, safe,
