the, canadian, shield, french, bouclier, canadien, also, called, the, laurentian, shield, or, the, laurentian, plateau, is, a, geologic, shield, a, large, area, of, exposed, precambrian, igneous, and, high, grade, metamorphic, rocks, it, forms, the, north, american, craton, or, laurentia, the, ancient, geologic, core, of, the, north, american, continent, glaciation, has, left, the, area, with, only, a, thin, layer, of, soil, through, which, exposures, of, igneous, bedrock, resulting, from, its, long, volcanic, history, are, frequently, visible, as, a, deep, common, joined, bedrock, region, in, eastern, and, central, canada, the, shield, stretches, north, from, the, great, lakes, to, the, arctic, ocean, covering, over, half, of, canada, and, most, of, greenland, it, also, extends, south, into, the, northern, reaches, of, the, continental, united, states, the, canadian, shield, is, a, physiographic, division, comprising, four, smaller, physiographic, provinces, the, laurentian, upland, kazan, region, davis, and, james, the, shield, extends, into, the, united, states, as, the, adirondack, mountains, connected, by, the, frontenac, axis, and, the, superior, upland, the, canadian, shield, is, a, u, shaped, subsection, of, the, laurentia, craton, signifying, the, area, of, greatest, glacial, impact, scraping, down, to, bare, rock, creating, the, thin, soils, the, age, of, the, canadian, shield, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 28, ga, the, canadian, shield, once, had, jagged, peaks, higher, than, any, of, today, s, mountains, but, millions, of, years, of, erosion, have, changed, these, mountains, to, rolling, hills, the, canadian, shield, is, a, collage, of, archean, plates, and, accreted, juvenile, arc, terranes, and, sedimentary, basins, of, the, proterozoic, eon, that, were, progressively, amalgamated, during, the, interval, 2, 45, 1, 24, ga, with, the, most, substantial, growth, period, occurring, during, the, trans, hudson, orogeny, between, c, 1, 90, 1, 80, ga, the, canadian, shield, was, the, first, part, of, north, america, to, be, permanently, elevated, above, sea, level, and, has, remained, almost, wholly, untouched, by, successive, encroachments, of, the, sea, upon, the, continent, it, is, the, earth, s, greatest, area, of, exposed, archean, rock, the, metamorphic, base, rocks, are, mostly, from, the, precambrian, between, 4, 5, ga, and, 540, ma, and, have, been, repeatedly, uplifted, and, eroded, today, it, consists, largely, of, an, area, of, low, relief, 300, 610, m, 980, 2, 000, ft, above, sea, level, with, a, few, monadnocks, and, low, mountain, ranges, including, the, laurentian, mountains, probably, eroded, from, the, plateau, during, the, cenozoic, era, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, continental, ice, sheets, depressed, the, land, surface, creating, hudson, bay, but, also, tilted, up, its, northeastern, rim, the, torngat, scooped, out, thousands, of, lake, basins, and, carried, away, much, of, the, region, s, soil, the, northeastern, portion, however, became, tilted, up, so, that, in, northern, labrador, and, baffin, island, the, land, rises, to, more, than, 1, 500, metres, 5, 000, feet, above, sea, level, when, the, greenland, section, is, included, the, canadian, shield, is, approximately, circular, bounded, on, the, northeast, by, the, northeast, edge, of, greenland, with, hudson, bay, in, the, middle, it, covers, much, of, greenland, all, of, labrador, and, the, great, northern, peninsula, of, newfoundland, most, of, quebec, north, of, the, st, lawrence, river, much, of, ontario, including, northern, sections, of, the, ontario, peninsula, the, adirondack, mountains, of, new, york, the, northernmost, part, of, lower, michigan, and, all, of, upper, michigan, northern, wisconsin, northeastern, minnesota, the, central, and, northern, portions, of, manitoba, northern, saskatchewan, a, small, portion, of, northeastern, alberta, mainland, northwest, territories, to, the, east, of, a, line, extended, north, from, the, saskatchewan, alberta, border, most, of, nunavut, s, mainland, and, of, its, arctic, archipelago, baffin, island, and, significant, bands, through, somerset, southampton, devon, and, ellesmere, islands, in, total, the, exposed, area, of, the, shield, covers, approximately, 8, 000, 000, km, 2, 3, 100, 000, sq, mi, the, true, extent, of, the, shield, is, greater, still, and, stretches, from, the, western, cordillera, in, the, west, to, the, appalachians, in, the, east, and, as, far, south, as, texas, but, these, regions, are, overlaid, with, much, younger, rocks, and, sediment, the, canadian, shield, is, among, the, oldest, geologic, areas, on, earth, with, regions, dating, from, 2, 5, to, 4, 2, billion, years, the, multitude, of, rivers, and, lakes, in, the, region, is, classical, example, of, a, deranged, drainage, system, caused, by, the, watersheds, of, the, area, being, disturbed, by, glaciation, and, the, effect, of, post, glacial, rebound, the, shield, was, originally, an, area, of, very, large, very, tall, mountains, about, 12, 000, m, or, 39, 000, ft, with, much, volcanic, activity, but, the, area, was, eroded, to, nearly, its, current, topographic, appearance, of, relatively, low, relief, over, 500, ma, erosion, has, exposed, the, roots, of, the, mountains, which, take, the, form, of, greenstone, belts, in, which, belts, of, volcanic, rock, that, have, been, altered, by, metamorphism, are, surrounded, by, granitic, rock, these, belts, range, in, age, from, 3, 6, to, 2, 7, ga, much, of, the, granitic, rock, belongs, to, the, distinctive, tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite, family, of, rocks, which, are, characteristic, of, archean, continental, crust, many, of, canada, s, major, ore, deposits, are, associated, with, greenstone, belts, the, sturgeon, lake, caldera, in, kenora, district, ontario, is, one, of, the, world, s, best, preserved, mineralized, neoarchean, caldera, complexes, which, is, 2, 7, ga, the, canadian, shield, also, contains, the, mackenzie, dike, swarm, which, is, the, largest, dike, swarm, known, on, earth, the, north, american, craton, is, the, bedrock, forming, the, heart, of, the, north, american, continent, and, the, canadian, shield, is, the, largest, exposed, part, of, the, craton, s, bedrock, the, canadian, shield, is, part, of, an, ancient, continent, called, arctica, which, was, formed, about, 2, 5, ga, during, the, neoarchean, era, mountains, have, deep, roots, and, float, on, the, denser, mantle, much, like, an, iceberg, at, sea, as, mountains, erode, their, roots, rise, and, are, eroded, in, turn, the, rocks, that, now, form, the, surface, of, the, shield, were, once, far, below, the, earth, s, surface, the, high, pressures, and, temperatures, at, those, depths, provided, ideal, conditions, for, mineralization, although, these, mountains, are, now, heavily, eroded, many, large, mountains, still, exist, in, canada, s, far, north, called, the, arctic, cordillera, this, is, a, vast, deeply, dissected, mountain, range, stretching, from, northernmost, ellesmere, island, to, the, northernmost, tip, of, labrador, the, range, s, highest, peak, is, nunavut, s, barbeau, peak, at, 2, 616, metres, 8, 583, ft, above, sea, level, precambrian, rock, is, the, major, component, of, the, bedrock, the, current, surface, expression, of, the, shield, is, one, of, very, thin, soil, lying, on, top, of, the, bedrock, with, many, bare, outcrops, this, arrangement, was, caused, by, severe, glaciation, during, the, ice, ages, that, covered, the, shield, and, scraped, the, rock, clean, the, lowlands, of, the, canadian, shield, have, a, very, dense, soil, that, is, not, suitable, for, forestation, it, also, contains, many, marshes, and, bogs, muskegs, the, rest, of, the, region, has, coarse, soil, that, does, not, retain, moisture, well, and, is, frozen, with, permafrost, throughout, the, year, forests, are, not, as, dense, in, the, north, the, shield, is, covered, in, parts, by, vast, boreal, forests, in, the, south, that, support, natural, ecosystems, as, well, as, a, major, logging, industry, the, boreal, forest, area, gives, way, to, the, eastern, canadian, shield, taiga, that, covers, northern, quebec, and, most, of, labrador, the, midwestern, canadian, shield, forests, that, run, westwards, from, northwestern, ontario, have, boreal, forests, that, give, way, to, taiga, in, the, most, northerly, parts, of, manitoba, and, saskatchewan, hydrologic, drainage, is, generally, poor, the, soil, compacting, effects, of, glaciation, being, one, of, the, many, causes, tundra, typically, prevails, in, the, northern, regions, many, mammals, such, as, beaver, caribou, white, tailed, deer, moose, wolves, wolverines, weasels, mink, otters, grizzly, bear, polar, bears, and, black, bears, are, present, in, the, case, of, polar, bears, ursus, maritimus, the, shield, area, contains, many, of, their, denning, locations, such, as, the, wapusk, national, park, the, many, lakes, and, rivers, on, the, shield, contain, a, plentiful, quantity, of, different, sports, fish, species, including, walleye, northern, pike, lake, trout, yellow, perch, whitefish, brook, trout, arctic, grayling, and, many, types, of, baitfish, the, water, surfaces, are, also, home, to, many, waterfowl, most, notably, canada, geese, loons, and, gulls, the, vast, forests, contain, a, myriad, population, of, other, birds, including, ravens, and, crows, predatory, birds, and, many, songbirds, the, canadian, shield, is, one, of, the, world, s, richest, areas, in, terms, of, mineral, ores, it, is, filled, with, substantial, deposits, of, nickel, gold, silver, and, copper, there, are, many, mining, towns, extracting, these, minerals, the, largest, and, one, of, the, best, known, is, sudbury, ontario, sudbury, is, an, exception, to, the, normal, process, of, forming, minerals, in, the, shield, since, the, sudbury, basin, is, an, ancient, meteorite, impact, crater, ejecta, from, the, meteorite, impact, was, found, in, the, rove, formation, in, may, 2007, the, nearby, but, less, known, temagami, magnetic, anomaly, has, striking, similarities, to, the, sudbury, basin, this, suggests, it, could, be, a, second, metal, rich, impact, crater, in, northeastern, quebec, the, giant, manicouagan, reservoir, is, the, site, of, an, extensive, hydroelectric, project, manic, cinq, or, manic, 5, this, is, one, of, the, largest, known, meteorite, impact, craters, on, earth, though, not, as, large, as, the, sudbury, crater, the, flin, flon, greenstone, belt, in, central, manitoba, and, east, central, saskatchewan, is, one, of, the, largest, paleoproterozoic, volcanic, hosted, massive, sulfide, vms, districts, in, the, world, containing, 27, copper, zinc, gold, deposits, from, which, more, than, 183, million, tonnes, of, sulfide, have, been, mined, the, portion, in, the, northwest, territories, has, recently, been, the, site, of, several, major, diamond, discoveries, the, kimberlite, pipes, in, which, the, diamonds, are, found, are, closely, associated, with, cratons, which, provide, the, deep, lithospheric, mantle, required, to, stabilize, diamond, as, a, mineral, the, kimberlite, eruptions, then, bring, the, diamonds, from, over, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, depth, to, the, surface, the, ekati, and, diavik, mines, are, actively, mining, kimberlite, diamonds
