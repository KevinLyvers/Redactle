many, aspects, of, mauritanian, life, such, as, law, and, the, education, system, this, was, also, a, reaction, to, the, consequences, of, the, french, domination, under, the, colonial, rule, various, models, for, maintaining, the, country, s, cultural, diversity, have, been, suggested, but, none, have, been, successfully, implemented, this, ethnic, discord, was, evident, during, intercommunal,

legal, ties, prior, to, spanish, colonization, neither, set, of, ties, was, sufficient, to, affect, the, application, of, the, un, general, assembly, declaration, on, the, granting, of, independence,
