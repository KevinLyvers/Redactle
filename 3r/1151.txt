the, origin, and, meaning, of, the, word, tegucigalpa, is, derived, from, the, nahuatl, language, the, most, widely, accepted, version, suggests, that, it, comes, from, the, nahuatl, word, taguz, galpa, which, means, hills, of, silver, but, this, interpretation, is, uncertain, since, the, natives, who, occupied, the, region, at, the, time, were, unaware, of, the, existence, of, mineral, deposits, in, the, area, another, source, suggests, that, tegucigalpa, derives, from, another, language, in, which, it, means, painted, rocks, as, explained, by, leticia, oyuela, in, her, book, minimum, history, of, tegucigalpa, other, theories, indicate, it, may, derive, from, the, term, togogalpa, which, refers, to, tototi, meaning, a, small, green, parrot, in, nahuatl, and, toncont, n, a, small, town, near, tegucigalpa, toncot, n, was, a, mexican, dance, of, nahuatl, origin, in, mexico, it, is, believed, the, word, tegucigalpa, is, from, the, nahuatl, word, tecuztlicallipan, meaning, place, of, residence, of, the, noble, or, tecuhtzincalpan, meaning, place, on, the, home, of, the, beloved, master, honduran, philologist, alberto, de, jes, s, membre, o, wrote, in, his, book, indigenous, toponymies, of, central, america, that, he, thinks, tegucigalpa, is, a, nahuatl, word, meaning, in, the, homes, of, the, sharp, stones, and, rules, out, the, traditional, meaning, hills, of, silver, arguing, that, taguzgalpa, was, the, name, of, the, ancient, eastern, zone, of, honduras, tegucigalpa, was, founded, by, spanish, settlers, as, real, de, minas, de, san, miguel, de, tegucigalpa, on, september, 29, 1578, on, the, site, of, an, existing, native, settlement, of, the, lenca, and, tolupans, the, first, mayor, of, tegucigalpa, was, juan, de, la, cueva, who, took, office, in, 1579, the, dolores, church, 1735, the, san, miguel, cathedral, 1765, the, casa, de, la, moneda, 1780, and, the, immaculate, conception, church, 1788, were, some, of, the, first, important, buildings, constructed, almost, 200, years, later, on, june, 10, 1762, this, mining, town, became, real, villa, de, san, miguel, de, tegucigalpa, y, heredia, under, the, rule, of, alonso, fern, ndez, de, heredia, then, acting, governor, of, honduras, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, saw, disruption, in, tegucigalpa, s, local, government, from, being, extinguished, in, 1788, to, becoming, part, of, comayagua, in, 1791, to, returning, to, self, city, governance, in, 1817, in, 1817, then, mayor, narciso, mallol, started, the, construction, of, the, first, bridge, a, ten, arch, masonry, connecting, both, sides, of, the, choluteca, river, upon, completion, four, years, later, it, linked, tegucigalpa, with, her, neighbor, city, of, comayagua, in, 1821, tegucigalpa, legally, became, a, city, in, 1824, the, first, congress, of, the, republic, of, honduras, declared, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, then, the, two, most, important, cities, in, the, country, to, alternate, as, capital, of, the, country, after, october, 1838, following, honduras, independence, as, a, single, republic, the, capital, continued, to, switch, back, and, forth, between, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, until, october, 30, 1880, when, tegucigalpa, was, declared, the, permanent, capital, of, honduras, by, then, president, marco, aurelio, soto, a, popular, myth, claims, that, the, society, of, comayagua, the, long, time, colonial, capital, of, honduras, publicly, disliked, the, wife, of, president, soto, who, took, revenge, by, moving, the, capital, to, tegucigalpa, a, more, likely, theory, is, that, the, change, took, place, because, president, soto, was, an, important, partner, of, the, rosario, mining, company, an, american, silver, mining, company, whose, operations, were, based, in, san, juancito, close, to, tegucigalpa, and, he, needed, to, be, close, to, his, personal, interests, by, 1898, it, was, decided, that, both, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, being, neighbor, cities, on, the, banks, of, the, choluteca, river, would, form, the, capital, but, with, separate, names, and, separate, local, governments, during, this, period, both, cities, had, a, population, of, about, 40, 000, people, between, the, 1930s, and, 1960s, tegucigalpa, continued, to, grow, reaching, a, population, of, over, 250, 000, people, giving, way, to, what, would, become, one, of, the, biggest, neighborhoods, in, the, city, the, colonia, kennedy, the, nation, s, autonomous, university, the, unah, and, the, construction, of, the, honduras, maya, hotel, it, still, remained, relatively, small, and, provincial, until, the, 1970s, when, migration, from, the, rural, areas, began, in, earnest, during, the, 1980s, several, avenues, traffic, overpasses, and, large, buildings, were, erected, a, relative, novelty, to, a, city, characterized, until, then, by, two, story, buildings, however, lacking, the, enforcement, of, city, planning, and, zoning, laws, it, led, to, highly, disorganized, urbanization, this, lack, of, proper, urbanization, as, the, population, has, grown, is, evident, on, the, surrounding, slopes, of, the, several, hills, in, the, city, where, some, of, the, city, s, most, impoverished, neighborhoods, have, prevailed, on, 30, october, 1998, hurricane, mitch, devastated, the, capital, along, with, the, rest, of, honduras, for, five, days, mitch, pounded, the, country, creating, devastating, landslides, and, floods, causing, the, death, of, thousands, as, well, as, heavy, deforestation, and, the, destruction, of, thousands, of, homes, a, portion, of, comayagua, was, destroyed, along, with, several, neighborhoods, on, both, sides, of, the, honduran, capital, after, the, hurricane, infrastructure, in, tegucigalpa, was, severely, damaged, even, 12, years, later, remnants, of, hurricane, mitch, were, still, visible, especially, along, the, banks, of, the, choluteca, river, today, tegucigalpa, continues, to, sprawl, far, beyond, its, former, colonial, core, towards, the, east, south, and, west, creating, a, large, but, disorganized, metropolis, in, an, effort, to, modernize, the, capital, increase, its, infrastructure, and, improve, the, quality, of, life, of, its, inhabitants, the, administration, has, passed, several, ordinances, and, projects, to, turn, the, city, around, within, the, upcoming, years, tegucigalpa, is, located, on, a, chain, of, mountains, with, elevations, of, 975, metres, 3, 199, ft, at, its, lowest, points, and, 1, 463, metres, 4, 800, ft, at, its, highest, suburban, areas, like, most, of, the, interior, highlands, of, honduras, the, majority, of, tegucigalpa, s, current, area, was, occupied, by, open, woodland, the, area, surrounding, the, city, continues, to, be, open, woodland, supporting, pine, forest, interspersed, with, some, oak, scrub, and, grassy, clearings, as, well, as, needle, leaf, evergreen, and, broadleaf, deciduous, forest, the, metropolitan, area, of, both, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, covers, a, total, area, of, 201, square, kilometers, 77, 6, sq, mi, while, the, entire, municipality, of, the, central, district, covers, a, total, area, of, 1, 396, square, kilometers, 539, 1, sq, mi, geological, faults, that, are, a, threat, to, the, neighborhoods, on, and, below, the, hill, have, been, identified, in, the, district, s, high, regions, surrounding, the, capital, the, choluteca, river, which, crosses, the, city, from, south, to, north, physically, separates, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, el, picacho, hill, a, rugged, mountain, of, moderate, height, rises, above, the, downtown, area, several, neighborhoods, both, upscale, residential, and, lower, income, are, located, on, its, slopes, the, city, consists, of, gentle, hills, and, the, ring, of, mountains, surrounding, the, city, tends, to, trap, pollution, during, the, dry, season, a, dense, cloud, of, smog, lingers, in, the, basin, until, the, first, rains, fall, tucked, into, a, valley, and, bisected, by, a, river, tegucigalpa, is, prone, to, flooding, during, the, rainy, season, as, experienced, to, the, fullest, during, hurricane, mitch, and, to, a, lesser, degree, every, year, during, the, rainy, season, despite, being, several, thousand, feet, above, sea, level, the, city, lacks, an, efficient, flood, control, system, including, canals, and, sewerage, powerful, enough, to, channel, rainwater, back, into, the, river, to, flow, down, to, the, ocean, the, river, itself, is, a, threat, since, it, isn, t, deep, enough, below, the, streets, nor, are, there, levees, high, enough, to, prevent, it, from, breaking, out, there, are, more, than, 100, neighborhoods, deemed, zones, of, high, risk, several, of, them, ruled, out, as, uninhabitable, in, their, entirety, there, is, a, reservoir, known, as, embalse, los, laureles, west, of, the, city, providing, 30, percent, of, the, city, s, water, supply, as, well, as, a, water, treatment, plant, south, of, the, city, about, 7, 3, kilometres, 4, 5, mi, from, the, airport, part, of, the, concepci, n, reservoir, just, 6, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, southwest, of, the, water, plant, the, central, district, shares, borders, with, 13, other, municipalities, of, francisco, moraz, n, to, the, north, cedros, and, talanga, south, ojojona, santa, ana, san, buenaventura, and, maraita, east, san, juan, de, flores, villa, de, san, francisco, santa, luc, a, valle, de, ngeles, san, antonio, de, oriente, and, tatumbla, and, to, the, west, lepaterique, it, is, also, bordered, on, the, west, by, two, municipalities, of, the, comayagua, department, villa, de, san, antonio, and, laman, with, the, latter, exactly, at, the, quadripoint, where, the, central, district, lepaterique, villa, de, san, antonio, and, laman, all, meet, tegucigalpa, has, a, tropical, savanna, climate, aw, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, milder, due, to, the, elevation, and, with, two, distinct, seasons, the, rainy, season, and, the, dry, season, like, much, of, central, honduras, the, city, has, a, tropical, climate, though, tempered, by, the, altitude, meaning, less, humid, than, the, lower, valleys, and, the, coastal, regions, with, median, temperatures, averaging, between, 19, c, 66, f, and, 23, c, 73, f, degrees, the, months, of, december, and, january, are, coolest, with, an, average, min, low, temperature, of, 14, c, 57, f, whereas, march, and, april, popularly, associated, with, holy, week, s, holidays, are, hottest, and, temperatures, can, reach, up, to, 40, c, 104, f, degrees, on, the, hottest, day, the, dry, season, lasts, from, november, through, april, and, the, rainy, season, from, may, through, october, there, is, an, average, of, 107, rainy, days, in, the, year, june, and, september, usually, the, wettest, months, the, average, sunshine, hours, per, month, during, the, year, is, 211, 2, and, the, average, rainy, days, per, month, is, 8, 9, the, average, sunshine, hours, during, the, dry, season, is, 228, per, month, while, 182, 5, millimetres, 7, 19, in, is, the, average, monthly, precipitation, during, the, wet, season, the, wettest, months, of, the, rainy, season, are, may, june, and, september, october, averaging, 16, 2, rainy, days, during, each, of, those, periods, tegucigalpa, as, with, the, rest, of, honduras, experienced, significant, damage, by, hurricane, mitch, in, late, october, and, early, november, 1998, something, of, a, magnitude, hondurans, had, not, witnessed, since, hurricane, fifi, mitch, destroyed, part, of, the, comayagua, section, of, the, city, as, well, as, other, places, along, the, banks, of, the, choluteca, river, the, storm, remained, over, honduran, territory, for, five, days, dumping, heavy, rainfall, late, in, the, rainy, season, the, ground, was, already, saturated, and, could, not, absorb, the, heavy, precipitation, while, deforestation, and, debris, left, by, the, hurricane, led, to, catastrophic, flooding, throughout, widespread, regions, of, the, country, especially, in, tegucigalpa, the, heavy, rain, caused, flash, floods, of, choluteca, s, tributaries, and, the, swollen, river, overflowed, its, banks, tearing, down, entire, neighborhoods, and, bridges, across, the, ravaged, city, the, rainfall, also, triggered, massive, landslides, around, el, berrinche, hill, close, to, the, downtown, area, these, landslides, destroyed, most, of, the, soto, neighborhood, and, debris, flowed, into, the, river, forming, a, dam, the, dam, clogged, the, waters, of, the, river, and, many, of, the, low, lying, areas, of, comayagua, were, submerged, historic, buildings, located, along, calle, real, were, either, completely, destroyed, or, so, badly, damaged, that, repair, was, futile, situated, in, a, valley, and, surrounded, by, mountain, ranges, tegucigalpa, is, hilly, with, several, elevations, and, few, flat, areas, the, city, is, also, highly, disorganized, particularly, around, its, oldest, districts, it, has, seen, a, rapid, growth, in, the, last, 30, years, and, only, recently, has, the, government, passed, some, of, the, laws, establishing, city, planning, and, zoning, rules, surface, roads, can, be, narrow, with, the, most, important, avenues, carrying, no, more, than, two, or, three, lanes, running, in, each, direction, adding, to, the, problem, of, heavy, traffic, congestion, several, of, the, main, boulevards, have, been, equipped, with, interchanges, overpasses, and, underpasses, allowing, for, sections, of, controlled, access, highways, but, considering, that, even, the, city, s, beltway, does, not, entirely, circle, the, city, the, roads, are, generally, limited, access, intense, webs, of, electrical, and, telephone, lines, above, the, streets, are, a, common, sight, in, the, capital, and, in, virtually, all, honduran, cities, since, the, implementation, of, underground, utility, lines, has, only, been, adopted, in, recent, years, the, metropolitan, area, of, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, is, officially, divided, into, barrios, and, colonias, and, there, are, 892, of, them, colonias, represent, relatively, recent, 20th, century, middle, class, residential, suburbs, some, known, as, residenciales, for, their, upper, income, development, and, these, are, continuously, spreading, while, the, barrios, are, old, inner, city, neighborhoods, while, the, city, administration, divides, the, capital, into, barrios, and, colonias, the, fact, that, there, are, hundreds, of, them, makes, it, difficult, to, define, the, city, s, different, regions, especially, for, those, not, familiar, with, the, central, district, to, have, a, better, understanding, of, the, city, s, regions, the, metro, area, of, the, central, district, can, essentially, be, divided, first, into, two, sections, tegucigalpa, and, comayagua, these, two, entities, remain, separated, by, the, choluteca, river, basin, that, runs, between, them, the, tegucigalpa, side, of, the, district, can, be, divided, into, five, sections, 1, centro, hist, rico, historic, downtown, 2, centro, contempor, neo, or, zona, viva, contemporary, downtown, or, vibrant, zone, 3, north, tegucigalpa, 4, south, tegucigalpa, and, 5, east, tegucigalpa, this, section, of, the, city, is, perhaps, the, best, developed, and, properly, urbanized, it, is, formed, by, more, than, 40, neighborhoods, many, of, them, wealthy, middle, class, residential, areas, such, as, colonia, palmira, to, the, east, of, the, historic, center, on, boulevard, moraz, n, which, hosts, several, foreign, embassies, as, well, as, upscale, restaurants, other, upscale, neighborhoods, are, lomas, del, guijarro, loma, linda, and, lomas, del, mayab, which, house, most, of, the, apartment, complexes, in, the, city, boulevard, moraz, n, and, avenida, los, pr, ceres, avenida, la, paz, are, busy, commercial, corridors, running, parallel, to, each, other, and, run, through, several, neighborhoods, home, to, foreign, embassies, a, hotel, district, business, establishments, and, corporate, buildings, including, los, pr, ceres, comercial, park, parque, comercial, boulevard, suyapa, and, boulevard, juan, pablo, ii, are, located, south, of, the, aforementioned, boulevards, and, they, also, form, a, busy, commercial, and, financial, district, stretching, through, several, neighborhoods, such, as, colonia, los, profesionales, where, the, presidential, house, is, located, colonia, florencia, norte, where, multiplaza, mall, is, located, colonia, miramontes, among, others, housing, several, financial, institutions, government, offices, hotels, etc, comayaguela, is, found, on, the, west, bank, of, the, choluteca, river, and, most, of, its, urbanization, is, made, up, of, lower, income, neighborhoods, historically, comayagua, has, remained, less, developed, than, the, other, side, of, the, capital, some, citing, insufficient, contribution, from, public, officials, in, recent, years, this, western, side, of, the, capital, has, seen, some, growth, and, improvement, such, as, the, opening, of, metromall, near, the, airport, with, the, construction, of, mall, premier, and, city, mall, the, latter, to, become, the, largest, mall, in, the, country, comayagua, will, be, receiving, another, upgrade, there, are, an, estimated, 650, 000, residents, in, comayag, ela, contributing, 58, 3, percent, of, the, 120, million, lempiras, us, 6, 349, million, generated, every, day, by, commerce, in, the, central, district, the, comayagua, side, of, the, capital, can, be, divided, into, four, sections, 1, zona, centro, downtown, comayagua, 2, north, comayagua, 3, south, comayagua, and, 4, west, comayagua, the, 2013, honduran, census, recorded, a, population, of, 1,
