following, the, establishment, of, the, city, as, the, capital, of, the, fatimid, dynasty, its, full, formal, name, was, al, q, hirah, al, mu, izziyyah, meaning, the, vanquisher, of, al, mu, izz, it, is, also, supposedly, due, to, the, fact, that, the, planet, mars, known, in, arabic, by, names, such, as, an, najm, al, q, hir, the, conquering, star, was, rising, at, the, time, of, the, city, s, founding, egyptians, often, refer, to, cairo, as, ma, r, ipa, the, egyptian, arabic, name, for, egypt, itself, emphasizing, the, city, s, importance, for, the, country, there, are, a, number, of,

and, which, is, modern, folk, etymology, meaning, land, of, sun, some, argue, that, it, was, the, name, of, an, egyptian, settlement, upon, which, cairo, was, built, but, it, is, rather, doubtful, as,

from, alexandria, ipa, egyptian, arabic, the, area, around, present, day, cairo, had, long, been, a, focal, point, of, ancient, egypt, due, to, its, strategic, location, at, the, junction, of, the, nile, valley, and, the, nile, delta, regions, roughly, upper, egypt, and, lower, egypt, which, also, placed, it, at, the, crossing, of, major, routes, between, north, africa, and, the, levant, memphis, the, capital, of, egypt, during, the, old, kingdom, and, a, major, city, up, until, the, ptolemaic, period, was, located, a, short, distance, south, west, of, present, day, cairo, heliopolis, another, important, city, and, major, religious, center, was, located, in, what, are, now, the, modern, districts, of, matariya, and, ain, shams, in, northeastern, cairo, it, was, largely, destroyed, by, the, persian, invasions, in, 525, bc, and, 343, bc, and, partly, abandoned, by, the, late, first, century, bc, however, the, origins, of, modern, cairo, are, generally, traced, back, to, a, series, of, settlements, in, the, first, millennium, ad, around, the, turn, of, the, fourth, century, as, memphis, was, continuing, to, decline, in, importance, the, romans, established, a, large, fortress, along, the, east, bank, of, the, nile, the, fortress, called, babylon, was, built, by, the, roman, emperor, diocletian, r, 285, 305, at, the, entrance, of, a, canal, connecting, the, nile, to, the, red, sea, that, was, created, earlier, by, emperor, trajan, r, 98, 117, further, north, of, the, fortress, near, the, present, day, district, of, al, azbakiya, was, a, port, and, fortified, outpost, known, as, tendunyas, coptic, or, umm, dunayn, while, no, structures, older, than, the, 7th, century, have, been, preserved, in, the, area, aside, from, the, roman, fortifications, historical, evidence, suggests, that, a, sizeable, city, existed, the, city, was, important, enough, that, its, bishop, cyrus, participated, in, the, second, council, of, ephesus, in, 449, the, byzantine, sassanian, war, between, 602, and, 628, caused, great, hardship, and, likely, caused, much, of, the, urban, population, to, leave, for, the, countryside, leaving, the, settlement, partly, deserted, the, site, today, remains, at, the, nucleus, of, the, coptic, orthodox, community, which, separated, from, the, roman, and, byzantine, churches, in, the, late, 4th, century, cairo, s, oldest, extant, churches, such, as, the, church, of, saint, barbara, and, the, church, of, saints, sergius, and, bacchus, from, the, late, 7th, or, early, 8th, century, are, located, inside, the,

to, babylon, fortress, the, city, known, as, fustat, arabic, romanized, al, fus, lit, the, tent, served, as, a, garrison, town, and, as, the, new, administrative, capital, of, egypt, historians, such, as, janet, abu, lughod, and, andr, raymond, trace, the, genesis, of, present, day, cairo, to, the, foundation, of, fustat, the, choice, of, founding, a, new, settlement, at, this, inland, location, instead, of, using, the, existing, capital, of, alexandria, on, the, mediterranean, coast, may, have, been, due, to, the, new, conquerors, strategic, priorities, one, of, the, first, projects, of, the, new, muslim, administration, was, to, clear, and, re, open, trajan, s, ancient, canal, in, order, to, ship, grain, more, directly, from, egypt, to, medina, the, capital, of, the, caliphate, in, arabia, ibn, al, as, also, founded, a, mosque, for, the, city, at, the, same, time, now, known, as, the, mosque, of, amr, ibn, al, as, the, oldest, mosque, in, egypt, and, africa, although, the, current, structure, dates, from, later, expansions, in, 750, following, the, overthrow, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, by, the, abbasids, the, new, rulers, created, their, own, settlement, to, the, northeast, of, fustat, which, became, the, new, provincial, capital, this, was, known, as, al, askar, arabic, lit, the, camp, as, it, was, laid, out, like, a, military, camp, a, governor, s, residence, and, a, new, mosque, were, also, added, with, the, latter, completed, in, 786, the, red, sea, canal, re, excavated, in, the, 7th, century, was, closed, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, in, al, mansur, r, 754, 775, but, a, part, of, the, canal, known, as, the, khalij, continued, to, be, a, major, feature, of, cairo, s, geography, and, of, its, water, supply, until, the, 19th, century, in, 861, on, the, orders, of, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mutawakkil, a, nilometer, was, built, on, roda, island, near, fustat, although, it, was, repaired, and, given, a, new, roof, in, later, centuries, its, basic, structure, is, still, preserved, today, making, it, the, oldest, preserved, islamic, era, structure, in, cairo, today, in, 868, a, commander, of, turkic, origin, named, bakbak, was, sent, to, egypt, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mu, taz, to, restore, order, after, a, rebellion, in, the, country, he, was, accompanied, by, his, stepson, ahmad, ibn, tulun, who, became, effective, governor, of, egypt, over, time, ibn, tulun, gained, an, army, and, accumulated, influence, and, wealth, allowing, him, to, become, the, de, facto, independent, ruler, of, both, egypt, and, syria, by, 878, in, 870, he, used, his, growing, wealth, to, found, a, new, administrative, capital, al, qata, i, arabic, lit, the, allotments, to, the, northeast, of, fustat, and, of, al, askar, the, new, city, included, a, palace, known, as, the, dar, al, imara, a, parade, ground, known, as, al, maydan, a, bimaristan, hospital, and, an, aqueduct, to, supply, water, between, 876, and, 879, ibn, tulun, built, a, great, mosque, now, known, as, the, mosque, of, ibn, tulun, at, the, center, of, the, city, next, to, the, palace, after, his, death, in, 884, ibn, tulun, was, succeeded, by, his, son, and, his, descendants, who, continued, a, short, lived, dynasty, the, tulunids, in, 905, the, abbasids, sent, general, muhammad, sulayman, al, katib, to, re, assert, direct, control, over, the, country, tulunid, rule, was, ended, and, al, qatta, i, was, razed, to, the, ground, except, for, the, mosque, which, remains, standing, today, in, 969, the, shi, a, isma, ili, fatimid, empire, conquered, egypt, after, ruling, from, ifriqiya, the, fatimid, general, jawhar, al, saqili, founded, a, new, fortified, city, northeast, of, fustat, and, of, former, al, qata, i, it, took, four, years, to, build, the, city, initially, known, as, al, man, riyyah, which, was, to, serve, as, the, new, capital, of, the, caliphate, during, that, time, the, construction, of, the, al, azhar, mosque, was, commissioned, by, order, of, the, caliph, which, developed, into, the, third, oldest, university, in, the, world, cairo, would, eventually, become, a, centre, of, learning, with, the, library, of, cairo, containing, hundreds, of, thousands, of, books, when, caliph, al, mu, izz, li, din, allah, arrived, from, the, old, fatimid, capital, of, mahdia, in, tunisia, in, 973, he, gave, the, city, its, present, name, q, hirat, al, mu, izz, the, vanquisher, of, al, mu, izz, from, which, the, name, cairo, al, q, hira, originates, the, caliphs, lived, in, a, vast, and, lavish, palace, complex, that, occupied, the, heart, of, the, city, cairo, remained, a, relatively, exclusive, royal, city, for, most, of, this, era, but, during, the, tenure, of, badr, al, gamali, as, vizier, 1073, 1094, the, restrictions, were, loosened, for, the, first, time, and, richer, families, from, fustat, were, allowed, to, move, into, the, city, between, 1087, and, 1092, badr, al, gamali, also, rebuilt, the, city, walls, in, stone, and, constructed, the, city, gates, of, bab, al, futuh, bab, al, nasr, and, bab, zuweila, that, still, stand, today, during, the, fatimid, period, fustat, reached, its, apogee, in, size, and, prosperity, acting, as, a, center, of, craftsmanship, and, international, trade, and, as, the, area, s, main, port, on, the, nile, historical, sources, report, that, multi, story, communal, residences, existed, in, the, city, particularly, in, its, center, which, were, typically, inhabited, by, middle, and, lower, class, residents, some, of, these, were, as, high, as, seven, stories, and, could, house, some, 200, to, 350, people, they, may, have, been, similar, to, roman, insulae, and, may, have, been, the, prototypes, for, the, rental, apartment, complexes, which, became, common, in, the, later, mamluk, and, ottoman, periods, however, in, 1168, the, fatimid, vizier, shawar, set, fire, to, unfortified, fustat, to, prevent, its, potential, capture, by, amalric, the, crusader, king, of, jerusalem, while, the, fire, did, not, destroy, the, city, and, it, continued, to, exist, afterward, it, did, mark, the, beginning, of, its, decline, over, the, following, centuries, it, was, cairo, the, former, palace, city, that, became, the, new, economic, center, and, attracted, migration, from, fustat, while, the, crusaders, did, not, capture, the, city, in, 1168, a, continuing, power, struggle, between, shawar, king, amalric, and, the, zengid, general, shirkuh, led, to, the, downfall, of, the, fatimid, establishment, in, 1169, shirkuh, s, nephew, saladin, was, appointed, as, the, new, vizier, of, egypt, by, the, fatimids, and, two, years, later, he, seized, power, from, the, family, of, the, last, fatimid, caliph, al, id, as, the, first, sultan, of, egypt, saladin, established, the, ayyubid, dynasty, based, in, cairo, and, aligned, egypt, with, the, sunni, abbasids, who, were, based, in, baghdad, in, 1176, saladin, began, construction, on, the, cairo, citadel, which, was, to, serve, as, the, seat, of, the, egyptian, government, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, construction, of, the, citadel, definitively, ended, fatimid, built, cairo, s, status, as, an, exclusive, palace, city, and, opened, it, up, to, common, egyptians, and, to, foreign, merchants, spurring, its, commercial, development, along, with, the, citadel, saladin, also, began, the, construction, of, a, new, 20, kilometre, long, wall, that, would, protect, both, cairo, and, fustat, on, their, eastern, side, and, connect, them, with, the, new, citadel, these, construction, projects, continued, beyond, saladin, s, lifetime, and, were, completed, under, his, ayyubid, successors, in, 1250, during, the, seventh, crusade, the, ayyubid, dynasty, had, a, crisis, with, the, death, of, al, salih, and, power, transitioned, instead, to, the, mamluks, partly, with, the, help, of, al, salih, s, wife, shajar, ad, durr, who, ruled, for, a, brief, period, around, this, time, mamluks, were, soldiers, who, were, purchased, as, young, slaves, and, raised, to, serve, in, the, sultan, s, army, between, 1250, and, 1517, the, throne, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, passed, from, one, mamluk, to, another, in, a, system, of, succession, that, was, generally, non, hereditary, but, also, frequently, violent, and, chaotic, the, mamluk, empire, nonetheless, became, a, major, power, in, the, region, and, was, responsible, for, repelling, the, advance, of, the, mongols, most, famously, at, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, in, 1260, and, for, eliminating, the, last, crusader, states, in, the, levant, despite, their, military, character, the, mamluks, were, also, prolific, builders, and, left, a, rich, architectural, legacy, throughout, cairo, continuing, a, practice, started, by, the, ayyubids, much, of, the, land, occupied, by, former, fatimid, palaces, was, sold, and, replaced, by, newer, buildings, becoming, a, prestigious, site, for, the, construction, of, mamluk, religious, and, funerary, complexes, construction, projects, initiated, by, the, mamluks, pushed, the, city, outward, while, also, bringing, new, infrastructure, to, the, centre, of, the, city, meanwhile, cairo, flourished, as, a, centre, of, islamic, scholarship, and, a, crossroads, on, the, spice, trade, route, among, the, civilisations, in, afro, eurasia, under, the, reign, of, the, mamluk, sultan, al, nasir, muhammad, 1293, 1341, with, interregnums, cairo, reached, its, apogee, in, terms, of, population, and, wealth, by, 1340, cairo, had, a, population, of, close, to, half, a, million, making, it, the, largest, city, west, of, china, multi, story, buildings, occupied, by, rental, apartments, known, as, a, rab, plural, rib, or, urbu, became, common, in, the, mamluk, period, and, continued, to, be, a, feature, of, the, city, s, housing, during, the, later, ottoman, period, these, apartments, were, often, laid, out, as, multi, story, duplexes, or, triplexes, they, were, sometimes, attached, to, caravanserais, where, the, two, lower, floors, were, for, commercial, and, storage, purposes, and, the, multiple, stories, above, them, were, rented, out, to, tenants, the, oldest, partially, preserved, example, of, this, type, of, structure, is, the, wikala, of, amir, qawsun, built, before, 1341, residential, buildings, were, in, turn, organized, into, close, knit, neighbourhoods, called, a, harat, which, in, many, cases, had, gates, that, could, be, closed, off, at, night, or, during, disturbances, when, the, traveller, ibn, battuta, first, came, to, cairo, in, 1326, he, described, it, as, the, principal, district, of, egypt, when, he, passed, through, the, area, again, on, his, return, journey, in, 1348, the, black, death, was, ravaging, most, major, cities, he, cited, reports, of, thousands, of, deaths, per, day, in, cairo, although, cairo, avoided, europe, s, stagnation, during, the, late, middle, ages, it, could, not, escape, the, black, death, which, struck, the, city, more, than, fifty, times, between, 1348, and, 1517, during, its, initial, and, most, deadly, waves, approximately, 200, 000, people, were, killed, by, the, plague, and, by, the, 15th, century, cairo, s, population, had, been, reduced, to, between, 150, 000, and, 300, 000, the, population, decline, was, accompanied, by, a, period, of, political, instability, between, 1348, and, 1412, it, was, nonetheless, in, this, period, that, the, largest, mamluk, era, religious, monument, the, madrasa, mosque, of, sultan, hasan, was, built, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, burji, mamluks, replaced, the, bahri, mamluks, as, rulers, of, the, mamluk, state, but, the, mamluk, system, continued, to, decline, though, the, plagues, returned, frequently, throughout, the, 15th, century, cairo, remained, a, major, metropolis, and, its, population, recovered, in, part, through, rural, migration, more, conscious, efforts, were, conducted, by, rulers, and, city, officials, to, redress, the, city, s, infrastructure, and, cleanliness, its, economy, and, politics, also, became, more, deeply, connected, with, the, wider, mediterranean, some, mamluk, sultans, in, this, period, such, as, barbsay, r, 1422, 1438, and, qaytbay, r, 1468, 1496, had, relatively, long, and, successful, reigns, after, al, nasir, muhammad, qaytbay, was, one, of, the, most, prolific, patrons, of, art, and, architecture, of, the, mamluk, era, he, built, or, restored, numerous, monuments, in, cairo, in, addition, to, commissioning, projects, beyond, egypt, the, crisis, of, mamluk, power, and, of, cairo, s, economic, role, deepened, after, qaytbay, the, city, s, status, was, diminished, after, vasco, da, gama, discovered, a, sea, route, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, between, 1497, and, 1499, thereby, allowing, spice, traders, to, avoid, cairo, cairo, s, political, influence, diminished, significantly, after, the, ottomans, defeated, sultan, al, ghuri, in, the, battle, of, marj, dabiq, in, 1516, and, conquered, egypt, in, 1517, ruling, from, constantinople, sultan, selim, i, relegated, egypt, to, a, province, with, cairo, as, its, capital, for, this, reason, the, history, of, cairo, during, ottoman, times, is, often, described, as, inconsequential, especially, in, comparison, to, other, time, periods, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, cairo, still, remained, an, important, economic, and, cultural, centre, although, no, longer, on, the, spice, route, the, city, facilitated, the, transportation, of, yemeni, coffee, and, indian, textiles, primarily, to, anatolia, north, africa, and, the, balkans, cairene, merchants, were, instrumental, in, bringing, goods, to, the, barren, hejaz, especially, during, the, annual, hajj, to, mecca, it, was, during, this, same, period, that, al, azhar, university, reached, the, predominance, among, islamic, schools, that, it, continues, to, hold, today, pilgrims, on, their, way, to, hajj, often, attested, to, the, superiority, of, the, institution, which, had, become, associated, with, egypt, s, body, of, islamic, scholars, the, first, printing, press, of, the, middle, east, printing, in, hebrew, was, established, in, cairo, c, 1557, by, a, scion, of, the, soncino, family, of, printers, italian, jews, of, ashkenazi, origin, who, operated, a, press, in, constantinople, the, existence, of, the, press, is, known, solely, from, two, fragments, discovered, in, the, cairo, geniza, under, the, ottomans, cairo, expanded, south, and, west, from, its, nucleus, around, the, citadel, the, city, was, the, second, largest, in, the, empire, behind, constantinople, and, although, migration, was, not, the, primary, source, of, cairo, s, growth, twenty, percent, of, its, population, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, consisted, of, religious, minorities, and, foreigners, from, around, the, mediterranean, still, when, napoleon, arrived, in, cairo, in, 1798, the, city, s, population, was, less, than, 300, 000, forty, percent, lower, than, it, was, at, the, height, of, mamluk, and, cairene, influence, in, the, mid, 14th, century, the, french, occupation, was, short, lived, as, british, and, ottoman, forces, including, a, sizeable, albanian, contingent, recaptured, the, country, in, 1801, cairo, itself, was, besieged, by, a, british, and, ottoman, force, culminating, with, the, french, surrender, on, 22, june, 1801, the, british, vacated, egypt, two, years, later, leaving, the, ottomans, the, albanians, and, the, long, weakened, mamluks, jostling, for, control, of, the, country, continued, civil, war, allowed, an, albanian, named, muhammad, ali, pasha, to, ascend, to, the, role, of, commander, and, eventually, with, the, approval, of, the, religious, establishment, viceroy, of, egypt, in, 1805, until, his, death, in, 1848, muhammad, ali, pasha, instituted, a, number, of, social, and, economic, reforms, that, earned, him, the, title, of, founder, of, modern,

cairo, under, isma, il, pasha, r, 1863, 1879, who, continued, the, modernisation, processes, started, by, his, grandfather, drawing, inspiration, from, paris, isma, il, envisioned, a, city, of, maidans, and, wide, avenues, due, to, financial, constraints, only, some, of, them, in, the, area, now, composing, downtown, cairo, came, to, fruition, isma, il, also, sought, to, modernize, the, city, which, was, merging, with, neighbouring, settlements, by, establishing, a, public, works, ministry, bringing, gas, and, lighting, to, the, city, and, opening, a, theatre, and, opera, house, the, immense, debt, resulting, from, isma, il, s, projects, provided, a, pretext, for, increasing, european, control, which, culminated, with, the, british, invasion, in, 1882, the, city, s, economic, centre, quickly, moved, west, toward, the, nile, away, from, the, historic, islamic, cairo, section, and, toward, the, contemporary, european, style, areas, built, by, isma, il, europeans, accounted, for, five, percent, of, cairo, s, population, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, by, which, point, they, held, most, top, governmental, positions, in, 1906, the, heliopolis, oasis, company, headed,

nevertheless, this, led, to, egypt, s, independence, in, 1922, the, king, fuad, i, edition, of, the, qur, an, was, first, published, on, 10, july, 1924, in, cairo, under, the, patronage, of, king, fuad, the, goal, of, the, government, of, the, newly, formed, kingdom, of, egypt, was, not, to, delegitimize, the, other, variant, quranic, texts, qira, at, but, to, eliminate, errors, found, in, qur, anic, texts, used, in, state, schools, a, committee, of, teachers, chose, to, preserve, a, single, one, of, the, canonical, qira, at, readings, namely, that, of, the, af, version, an, 8th, century, kufic, recitation, this, edition, has, become, the, standard, for, modern, printings, of, the, quran, for, much, of, the, islamic, world, the, publication, has, been, called, a, terrific, success, and, the, edition, has, been, described, as, one, now, widely, seen, as, the, official, text, of, the, qur, an, so, popular, among, both, sunni, and, shi, a, that, the, common, belief, among, less, well, informed, muslims, is, that, the, qur, an, has, a, single, unambiguous, reading, minor, amendments, were, made, later, in, 1924, and, in, 1936, the, faruq, edition, in, honour, of, then, ruler,

and, overcrowding, the, formal, city, was, also, expanded, the, most, notable, example, was, the, creation, of, madinat, nasr, a, huge, government, sponsored, expansion, of, the, city, to, the, east,
