the, scandinavian, mountains, or, the, scandes, is, a, mountain, range, that, runs, through, the, scandinavian, peninsula, the, western, sides, of, the, mountains, drop, precipitously, into, the, north, sea, and, norwegian, sea, forming, the, fjords, of, norway, whereas, to, the, northeast, they, gradually, curve, towards, finland, to, the, north, they, form, the, border, between, norway, and, sweden, reaching, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, high, at, the, arctic, circle, the, mountain, range, just, touches, northwesternmost, finland, but, are, scarcely, more, than, hills, at, their, northernmost, extension, at, the, north, cape, nordkapp, the, mountains, are, relatively, high, for, a, range, so, young, and, are, very, steep, in, places, galdh, piggen, in, south, norway, is, the, highest, peak, in, mainland, northern, europe, at, 2, 469, metres, 8, 100, ft, kebnekaise, is, the, highest, peak, on, the, swedish, side, at, 2, 104, m, 6, 903, ft, whereas, the, slope, of, halti, is, the, highest, point, in, finland, at, 1, 324, m, 4, 344, ft, although, the, peak, of, halti, is, situated, in, norway, the, scandinavian, montane, birch, forest, and, grasslands, terrestrial, ecoregion, is, closely, associated, with, the, mountain, range, its, names, in, the, scandinavian, languages, are, in, swedish, skandinaviska, fj, llkedjan, skanderna, encyclopedic, and, professional, usage, fj, llen, the, fells, common, in, colloquial, speech, or, k, len, the, keel, and, in, norwegian, den, skandinaviske, fjellkjede, fjellet, skandesfjellene, kj, len, the, keel, or, nordryggen, the, north, ridge, name, coined, in, 2013, the, names, k, len, and, kj, len, are, often, preferentially, used, for, the, northern, part, where, the, mountains, form, a, narrow, range, near, the, border, region, of, norway, and, sweden, in, south, norway, there, is, a, broad, scatter, of, mountain, regions, with, individual, names, such, as, dovrefjell, hardangervidda, jotunheimen, and, rondane, the, mountain, chain, s, highest, summits, are, mostly, concentrated, in, an, area, of, mean, altitude, of, over, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, between, stavanger, and, trondheim, in, south, norway, with, numerous, peaks, over, 1, 300, m, 4, 300, ft, and, some, peaks, over, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, around, trondheim, fjord, peaks, decrease, in, altitude, to, about, 400, 500, m, 1, 300, 1, 600, ft, rising, again, to, heights, in, excess, of, 1, 900, m, 6, 200, ft, further, north, in, swedish, lapland, and, nearby, areas, of, norway, the, southern, part, of, the, mountain, range, contains, the, highest, mountain, of, northern, europe, galdh, piggen, at, almost, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, this, part, of, the, mountain, chain, is, also, broader, and, contains, a, series, of, plateaux, and, gently, undulating, surfaces, that, hosts, scattered, inselbergs, the, plateaux, and, undulating, surfaces, of, the, southern, scandinavian, mountains, form, a, series, of, stepped, surfaces, geomorphologist, karna, lidmar, bergstr, m, and, co, workers, recognize, five, widespread, stepped, surfaces, in, eastern, norway, some, of, the, stepped, surfaces, merge, into, a, single, surface, dovre, and, jotunheimen, are, rises, from, the, highest, of, the, stepped, surfaces, in, south, western, norway, the, plateaux, and, gently, undulating, surfaces, are, strongly, dissected, by, fjords, and, valleys, the, mountain, chain, is, present, in, sweden, from, northern, dalarna, northwards, south, of, this, point, the, scandinavian, mountains, lie, completely, within, norway, most, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, lack, alpine, topography, and, where, present, it, does, not, relate, to, altitude, an, example, of, this, is, the, distribution, of, cirques, in, southern, norway, that, can, be, found, both, near, sea, level, and, at, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, most, cirques, are, found, between, 1, 000, and, 1, 500, m, 3, 300, and, 4, 900, ft, to, the, east, the, scandinavian, mountains, proper, bounds, with, mountains, that, are, lower, and, less, dissected, and, are, known, in, swedish, as, the, f, rfj, ll, literally, fore, fell, generally, the, f, rfj, ll, do, not, surpass, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, above, sea, level, as, a, geomorphic, unit, the, f, rfj, ll, extends, across, sweden, as, a, 650, km, 400, mi, long, and, 40, to, 80, km, 25, to, 50, mi, broad, belt, from, dalarna, in, the, south, to, norrbotten, in, the, north, while, lower, than, the, scandinavian, mountains, proper, the, f, rfj, ll, s, pronounced, relief, its, large, number, of, plateaux, and, its, coherent, valley, system, distinguish, it, from, so, called, undulating, hilly, terrain, swedish, bergkullsterr, ng, and, plains, with, residual, hills, swedish, bergkullsl, tt, found, further, east, the, climate, of, the, nordic, countries, is, maritime, along, the, coast, of, norway, and, much, more, continental, in, sweden, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, the, combination, of, a, northerly, location, and, moisture, from, the, north, atlantic, ocean, has, caused, the, formation, of, many, ice, fields, and, glaciers, in, the, mountains, the, air, temperature, decreases, with, increasing, altitude, and, patches, of, mountain, permafrost, in, regions, with, a, mean, annual, air, temperature, maat, of, 1, 5, c, 29, 5, f, will, be, found, at, wind, exposed, sites, with, little, snow, cover, during, winter, higher, up, widespread, permafrost, may, be, expected, at, altitudes, with, a, maat, of, 3, 5, c, 25, 5, f, continuous, permafrost, at, altitudes, with, a, maat, of, 6, c, 21, f, within, the, eu, sponsored, project, pace, permafrost, and, climate, in, europe, a, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, borehole, was, drilled, in, bedrock, above, tarfala, research, station, at, an, altitude, of, 1, 540, m, 5, 050, ft, above, sea, level, the, stable, ground, temperature, at, a, depth, of, 100, metres, 330, ft, is, still, 2, 75, c, 27, 05, f, the, measured, geothermal, gradient, in, the, drillhole, of, 1, 17, c, 100, m, allows, to, extrapolate, a, permafrost, thickness, of, 330, metres, 1, 080, ft, a, further, proof, that, continuous, permafrost, exists, in, these, altitudes, and, above, up, to, the, top, of, kebnekaise, in, the, scandinavian, mountains, the, lower, limit, of, widespread, discontinuous, permafrost, drops, from, 1, 700, metres, 5, 600, ft, in, the, west, of, southern, norway, to, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, near, the, border, with, sweden, and, from, 1, 600, metres, 5, 200, ft, in, northern, norway, to, 1, 100, metres, 3, 600, ft, in, northern, more, continental, sweden, kebnekaise, area, in, contrast, to, the, lower, limit, of, permafrost, the, mean, glacier, altitude, or, glaciation, limit, is, related, to, the, amount, of, precipitation, thus, the, snow, line, or, glacier, equilibrium, line, as, the, limit, between, the, accumulation, zone, and, ablation, zone, shows, the, opposite, trend, from, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, in, the, west, jostefonn, to, 2, 100, metres, 6, 900, ft, in, the, east, jotunheimen, most, of, the, rocks, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, are, caledonian, which, means, they, were, put, in, place, by, the, caledonian, orogeny, caledonian, rocks, overlie, rocks, of, the, much, older, svecokarelian, and, sveconorwegian, provinces, the, caledonian, rocks, actually, form, large, nappes, swedish, skollor, that, have, been, thrust, over, the, older, rocks, much, of, the, caledonian, rocks, have, been, eroded, since, they, were, put, in, place, meaning, that, they, were, once, thicker, and, more, contiguous, it, is, also, implied, from, the, erosion, that, the, nappes, of, caledonian, rock, once, reached, further, east, than, they, do, today, the, erosion, has, left, remaining, massifs, of, caledonian, rocks, and, windows, of, precambrian, rock, while, there, are, some, disagreements, geologists, generally, recognize, four, units, among, the, nappes, an, uppermost, an, upper, a, middle, and, a, lower, unit, the, lower, unit, is, made, up, ediacaran, vendian, cambrian, ordovician, and, silurian, aged, sedimentary, rocks, pieces, of, precambrian, shield, rocks, are, in, some, places, also, incorporated, into, the, lower, nappes, it, was, during, the, silurian, and, devonian, periods, that, the, caledonian, nappes, were, stacked, upon, the, older, rocks, and, upon, themselves, this, occurred, in, connection, to, the, closure, of, the, iapetus, ocean, as, the, ancient, continents, of, laurentia, and, baltica, collided, this, collision, produced, a, himalayas, sized, mountain, range, named, the, caledonian, mountains, roughly, over, the, same, area, as, the, present, day, scandinavian, mountains, the, caledonian, mountains, began, a, post, orogenic, collapse, in, the, devonian, implying, tectonic, extension, and, subsidence, despite, occurring, in, about, the, same, area, the, ancient, caledonian, mountains, and, the, modern, scandinavian, mountains, are, unrelated, the, origin, of, today, s, mountain, topography, is, debated, by, geologists, geologically, the, scandinavian, mountains, are, an, elevated, passive, continental, margin, similar, to, the, mountains, and, plateaux, found, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, north, atlantic, in, eastern, greenland, or, in, australia, s, great, dividing, range, the, scandinavian, mountains, attained, its, height, by, tectonic, processes, different, from, orogeny, chiefly, in, the, cenozoic, a, two, stage, model, of, uplift, has, been, proposed, for, the, scandinavian, mountains, in, south, norway, a, first, stage, in, the, mesozoic, and, a, second, stage, starting, from, the, oligocene, the, uplift, of, south, norway, has, elevated, the, westernmost, extension, of, the, sub, cambrian, peneplain, which, forms, part, of, what, is, known, as, the, paleic, surface, in, norway, in, south, norway, the, scandinavian, mountains, had, their, main, uplift, phase, later, neogene, than, in, northern, scandinavia, which, had, its, main, phase, of, uplift, in, the, paleogene, for, example, the, hardangervidda, uplifted, from, sea, level, to, its, present, 1, 200, 1, 100, m, 3, 900, 3, 600, ft, in, early, pliocene, times, the, various, episodes, of, uplift, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, were, similar, in, orientation, and, tilted, land, surfaces, to, the, east, while, allowing, rivers, to, incise, the, landscape, some, of, the, tilted, surfaces, constitute, the, muddus, plains, landscape, of, northern, sweden, the, progressive, tilt, contributed, to, create, the, parallel, drainage, pattern, of, northern, sweden, uplift, is, thought, to, have, been, accommodated, by, coast, parallel, normal, faults, and, not, by, fault, less, doming, therefore, the, common, labelling, of, the, southern, scandinavian, mountains, and, the, northern, scandinavian, mountains, as, two, domes, is, misleading, there, are, divided, opinions, on, the, relation, between, the, coastal, plains, of, norway, the, strandflat, and, the, uplift, of, the, mountains, unlike, orogenic, mountains, there, is, no, widely, accepted, geophysical, model, to, explain, elevated, passive, continental, margins, such, as, the, scandinavian, mountains, various, mechanisms, of, uplift, have, however, been, proposed, over, the, years, a, 2012, study, argues, that, the, scandinavian, mountains, and, other, elevated, passive, continental, margins, most, likely, share, the, same, mechanism, of, uplift, and, that, this, mechanism, is, related, to, far, field, stresses, in, earth, s, lithosphere, the, scandinavian, mountains, can, according, to, this, view, be, likened, to, a, giant, anticlinal, lithospheric, fold, folding, could, have, been, caused, by, horizontal, compression, acting, on, a, thin, to, thick, crust, transition, zone, as, are, all, passive, margins, alternative, lines, of, research, have, stressed, the, role, of, climate, in, inducing, erosion, that, induces, an, isostatic, compensation, fluvial, and, glacial, erosion, and, incision, during, the, quaternary, is, thought, to, have, contributed, to, the, uplift, of, the, mountain, by, forcing, an, isostatic, response, the, total, amount, of, uplift, produced, by, this, mechanism, could, be, as, much, as, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, other, geoscientists, have, implied, diapirism, in, the, asthenosphere, as, being, the, cause, of, uplift, one, hypothesis, states, that, the, early, uplift, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, could, be, indebted, to, changes, in, the, density, of, the, lithosphere, and, asthenosphere, caused, by, the, iceland, plume, when, greenland, and, scandinavia, rifted, apart, about, 53, million, years, ago, many, slopes, and, valleys, are, straight, because, they, follow, tectonic, fractures, that, are, more, prone, to, erosion, another, result, of, tectonics, in, the, relief, is, that, slopes, corresponding, to, footwalls, of, normal, faults, tend, to, be, straight, there, is, evidence, that, the, drainage, divide, between, the, norwegian, sea, and, the, south, east, flowing, rivers, were, once, further, west, glacial, erosion, is, thought, to, have, contributed, to, the, shift, of, the, divide, which, in, some, cases, ought, to, have, been, in, excess, of, 50, km, much, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, has, been, sculpted, by, glacial, erosion, the, mountain, chain, is, dotted, with, glacial, cirques, usually, separated, from, each, other, by, pre, glacial, paleosurfaces, glacier, erosion, has, been, limited, in, these, paleosurfaces, which, form, usually, plateaus, between, valleys, as, such, the, paleosurfaces, were, subject, of, diverging, and, slow, ice, flow, during, the, glaciations, in, contrast, valleys, concentrated, ice, flow, forming, fast, glaciers, or, ice, streams, at, some, locations, coalesced, cirques, form, ar, tes, and, pyramidal, peaks, glacial, reshaping, of, valleys, is, more, marked, in, the, western, part, of, the, mountain, chain, where, drowned, glacier, shaped, valleys, constitute, the, fjords, of, norway, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, mountain, chain, glacial, reshaping, of, valleys, is, weaker, many, mountain, tops, contain, blockfields, which, escaped, glacial, erosion, either, by, having, been, nunataks, in, the, glacial, periods, or, by, being, protected, from, erosion, under, cold, based, glacier, ice, karst, systems, with, their, characteristic, caves, and, sinkholes, occur, at, various, places, in, the, scandinavian, mountains, but, are, more, common, in, the, northern, parts, present, day, karst, systems, might, have, long, histories, dating, back, to, the, pleistocene, or, even, earlier, much, of, the, mountain, range, is, mantled, by, deposits, of, glacial, origin, including, till, blankets, moraines, drumlins, and, glaciofluvial, material, in, the, form, of, outwash, plains, and, eskers, bare, rock, surfaces, are, more, common, in, the, western, side, of, the, mountain, range, although, the, ages, of, these, deposits, and, landforms, vary, most, of, them, were, formed, in, connection, to, the, weichselian, glaciation, and, the, subsequent, deglaciation, the, cenozoic, glaciations, that, affected, fennoscandia, most, likely, began, in, the, scandinavian, mountains, it, is, estimated, that, during, 50, of, the, last, 2, 75, million, years, the, scandinavian, mountains, hosted, mountain, centered, ice, caps, and, ice, fields, the, ice, fields, from, which, the, fennoscandian, ice, sheet, grew, out, multiple, times, most, likely, resembled, today, s, ice, fields, in, andean, patagonia, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, ca, 20, ka, bp, all, the, scandinavian, mountains, were, covered, by, the, fennoscandian, ice, sheet, which, extended, well, beyond, the, mountains, into, denmark, germany, poland, and, the, former, ussr, as, the, ice, margin, started, to, recede, 22, 17, ka, bp, the, ice, sheet, became, increasingly, concentrated, in, the, scandinavian, mountains, recession, of, the, ice, margin, led, the, ice, sheet, to, be, concentrated, in, two, parts, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, one, part, in, south, norway, and, another, in, northern, sweden, and, norway, these, two, centres, were, for, a, time, linked, so, that, the, linkage, constituted, a, major, drainage, barrier, that, formed, various, large, ephemeral, ice, dammed, lakes, about, 10, ka, bp, the, linkage, had, disappeared, and, so, did, the, southern, centre, of, the, ice, sheet, a, thousand, years, later, the, northern, centre, remained, a, few, hundred, years, more, and, by, 9, 7, ka, bp, the, eastern, sarek, mountains, hosted, the, last, remnant, of, the, fennoscandian, ice, sheet, as, the, ice, sheet, retreated, to, the, scandinavian, mountains, it, was, dissimilar, to, the, early, mountain, glaciation, that, gave, origin, to, the, ice, sheet, as, the, ice, divide, lagged, behind, as, the, ice, mass, concentrated, in, the, west, of, the, 10, highest, mountain, peaks, in, scandinavia, prominence, greater, than, 30, m, or, 98, ft, six, are, situated, in, oppland, norway, the, other, four, are,
