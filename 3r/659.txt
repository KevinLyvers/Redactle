which, dominates, the, northwestern, and, central, portions, of, the, province, comprises, over, half, the, land, area, of, ontario, although, this, area, mostly, does, not, support, agriculture, it, is, rich, in, minerals, partly, covered, by, the, central, and, midwestern, canadian, shield, forests, and, studded, with, lakes, and, rivers, northern, ontario, is, subdivided, into, two, sub,

paleo, indians, were, the, first, people, to, settle, on, the, lands, of, ontario, about, 11, 000, years, ago, after, crossing, the, bering, land, bridge, from, asia, to, north, america, between, 25, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, during, the, archaic, period, which, lasted, from, 8000, 1000, bc, the, population, slowly, increased, with, a, generally, egalitarian, hunter, gatherer, society, and, a, warmer, climate, trading, routes, also, began, emerging, along, the, st, lawrence, river, and, around, the, great, lakes, hunting, and, gathering, remained, predominant, throughout, the, early, woodland, period, and, social, structures, and, trade, continued, to, develop, around, 500, ad, corn, cultivation, began, later, expanding, to, include, beans, and, squash, around, 1100, ad, increased, agriculture, enabled, more, permanent, fortified, and, significantly, larger, settlements, in, southern, ontario, during, the, 1400s, the, population, of, some, villages, numbered, in, the, thousands, with, longhouses, that, could, house, over, a, hundred, people, around, this, time, large, scale, warfare, began, in, southern, ontario, leading, to, the, emergence, of, iroquoian, groups, including, the, neutral, confederacy, erie, and, wendat, huron, groups, in, northern, ontario, were, primarily, algonquian, and, included, the, ojibwe, who, traded, with, the, iroquois, many, ethnocultural, groups, emerged, and, came, to, exist, on, the, lands, of, ontario, the, algonquins, mississaugas, ojibway, cree, odawa, pottowatomi, and, iroquois, in, the, 15th, century, the, byzantine, empire, fell, prompting, western, europeans, to, search, for, new, sea, routes, to, the, far, east, around, 1522, 1523, giovanni, da, verrazzano, persuaded, king, francis, i, of, france, to, commission, an, expedition, to, find, a, western, route, to, cathay, china, via, a, northwest, passage, though, this, expedition, was, unsuccessful, it, established, the, name, new, france, for, northeastern, north, america, after, a, few, expeditions, france, mostly, abandoned, north, america, for, 50, years, because, of, its, financial, crisis, france, was, involved, in, the, italian, wars, and, there, were, religious, wars, between, protestants, and, catholics, around, 1580, however, the, rise, of, the, fur, trade, particularly, the, demand, for, beaver, pelts, reignited, french, interest, in, 1608, samuel, de, champlain, established, france, s, first, colonial, settlement, in, new, france, the, habitation, de, qu, bec, now, quebec, city, in, the, colony, of, canada, now, southern, quebec, afterwards, french, explorers, continued, to, travel, west, establishing, new, villages, along, the, coasts, of, the, saint, lawrence, river, french, explorers, the, first, of, which, was, tienne, br, l, who, explored, the, georgian, bay, area, in, 1610, 1612, mapped, southern, ontario, and, called, the, region, the, pays, d, en, haut, upper, country, in, reference, to, the, region, being, upstream, of, the, saint, lawrence, river, the, colony, of, the, pays, d, en, haut, was, formally, established, in, 1610, as, an, administrative, dependency, of, canada, and, was, for, defence, and, business, rather, than, a, settlement, colony, the, territory, of, the, pays, d, en, haut, was, quite, large, and, would, today, include, the, province, of, ontario, as, well, as, in, whole, or, in, part, the, american, states, of, minnesota, wisconsin, illinois, indiana, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, and, new, york, indigenous, peoples, were, the, vast, majority, of, the, pays, d, en, haut, population, as, for, northern, ontario, the, english, explorer, henry, hudson, sailed, into, hudson, bay, in, 1611, and, claimed, its, drainage, basin, for, england, the, area, would, become, known, as, rupert, s, land, samuel, de, champlain, reached, lake, huron, in, 1615, and, french, missionaries, such, as, the, j, suites, and, supliciens, began, to, establish, posts, along, the, great, lakes, the, french, allied, with, most, indigenous, groups, of, ontario, all, for, the, fur, trade, and, for, defence, against, iroquois, attacks, which, would, later, be, called, the, iroquois, wars, the, french, would, declare, their, indigenous, allies, to, be, subjects, of, the, king, of, france, and, would, often, act, as, mediators, between, different, groups, the, iroquois, later, allied, themselves, with, the, british, from, 1634, to, 1640, the, huron, were, devastated, by, european, infectious, diseases, such, as, measles, and, smallpox, to, which, they, had, no, immunity, by, 1700, the, iroquois, had, been, driven, out, or, left, the, area, that, would, become, ontario, and, the, mississaugas, of, the, ojibwa, had, settled, the, north, shore, of, lake, ontario, the, remaining, huron, settled, north, of, quebec, during, the, french, and, indian, war, the, north, american, theatre, of, the, seven, years, war, of, 1754, to, 1763, the, british, defeated, the, armies, of, new, france, and, its, indigenous, allies, in, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, france, ceded, most, of, its, possessions, in, north, america, to, britain, using, the, quebec, act, britain, re, organised, the, territory, into, the, province, of, quebec, in, 1782, 1784, 5, 000, united, empire, loyalists, entered, what, is, now, ontario, following, the, american, revolution, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, granted, them, 200, acres, 81, ha, land, and, other, items, with, which, to, rebuild, their, lives, the, british, also, set, up, reserves, in, ontario, for, the, mohawks, who, had, fought, for, the, british, and, had, lost, their, land, in, new, york, state, other, iroquois, also, displaced, from, new, york, were, resettled, in, 1784, at, the, six, nations, reserve, at, the, west, end, of, lake, ontario, the, mississaugas, displaced, by, european, settlements, would, later, move, to, six, nations, also, after, the, american, war, of, independence, the, first, reserves, for, first, nations, were, established, these, are, situated, at, six, nations, 1784, tyendinaga, 1793, and, akwesasne, 1795, six, nations, and, tyendinaga, were, established, by, the, british, for, those, indigenous, groups, who, had, fought, on, the, side, of, the, british, and, were, expelled, from, the, new, united, states, akwesasne, was, a, pre, existing, mohawk, community, and, its, borders, were, formalized, under, the, 1795, jay, treaty, in, 1788, while, part, of, the, province, of, quebec, southern, ontario, was, divided, into, four, districts, hesse, lunenburg, mecklenburg, and, nassau, in, 1792, the, four, districts, were, renamed, hesse, became, the, western, district, lunenburg, became, the, eastern, district, mecklenburg, became, the, midland, district, and, nassau, became, the, home, district, counties, were, created, within, the, districts, the, population, of, canada, west, of, the, st, lawrence, ottawa, river, confluence, substantially, increased, during, this, period, a, fact, recognized, by, the, constitutional, act, of, 1791, which, split, quebec, into, the, canadas, upper, canada, southwest, of, the, st, lawrence, ottawa, river, confluence, and, lower, canada, east, of, it, john, graves, simcoe, was, appointed, upper, canada, s, first, lieutenant, governor, in, 1793, a, second, wave, of, americans, not, all, of, them, necessarily, loyalists, moved, to, upper, canada, after, 1790, until, the, pre, war, of, 1812, many, seeking, available, cheap, land, and, at, the, time, lower, taxation, by, 1798, there, were, eight, districts, eastern, home, johnstown, london, midland, newcastle, niagara, and, western, by, 1826, there, were, eleven, districts, bathurst, eastern, gore, home, johnstown, london, midland, newcastle, niagara, ottawa, and, western, by, 1838, there, were, twenty, districts, bathurst, brock, colbourne, dalhousie, eastern, gore, home, huron, johnstown, london, midland, newcastle, niagara, ottawa, prince, edward, simcoe, talbot, victoria, wellington, and, western, american, troops, in, the, war, of, 1812, invaded, upper, canada, across, the, niagara, river, and, the, detroit, river, but, were, defeated, and, pushed, back, by, the, british, canadian, fencibles, and, militias, and, first, nations, warriors, however, the, americans, eventually, gained, control, of, lake, erie, and, lake, ontario, the, 1813, battle, of, york, saw, american, troops, defeat, the, garrison, at, the, upper, canada, capital, of, york, the, americans, looted, the, town, and, burned, the, upper, canada, parliament, buildings, during, their, brief, occupation, the, british, would, burn, the, american, capital, of, washington, d, c, in, 1814, after, the, war, of, 1812, relative, stability, allowed, for, increasing, numbers, of, immigrants, to, arrive, from, europe, rather, than, from, the, united, states, as, was, the, case, in, the, previous, decades, this, immigration, shift, was, encouraged, by, the, colonial, leaders, despite, affordable, and, often, free, land, many, arriving, newcomers, mostly, from, britain, and, ireland, found, frontier, life, with, the, harsh, climate, difficult, and, some, of, those, with, the, means, eventually, returned, home, or, went, south, however, population, growth, far, exceeded, emigration, in, the, following, decades, it, was, a, mostly, agrarian, based, society, but, canal, projects, and, a, new, network, of, plank, roads, spurred, greater, trade, within, the, colony, and, with, the, united, states, thereby, improving, previously, damaged, relations, over, time, meanwhile, ontario, s, numerous, waterways, aided, travel, and, transportation, into, the, interior, and, supplied, water, power, for, development, as, the, population, increased, so, did, the, industries, and, transportation, networks, which, in, turn, led, to, further, development, by, the, end, of, the, century, ontario, vied, with, quebec, as, the, nation, s, leader, in, terms, of, growth, in, population, industry, arts, and, communications, unrest, in, the, colony, began, to, chafe, against, the, aristocratic, family, compact, who, governed, while, benefiting, economically, from, the, region, s, resources, and, who, did, not, allow, elected, bodies, power, this, resentment, spurred, republican, ideals, and, sowed, the, seeds, for, early, canadian, nationalism, accordingly, rebellion, in, favour, of, responsible, government, rose, in, both, regions, louis, joseph, papineau, led, the, lower, canada, rebellion, and, william, lyon, mackenzie, first, toronto, mayor, led, the, upper, canada, rebellion, in, upper, canada, the, rebellion, was, quickly, a, failure, william, lyon, mackenzie, escaped, to, the, united, states, where, he, declared, the, republic, of, canada, on, navy, island, on, the, niagara, river, although, both, rebellions, were, put, down, in, short, order, the, british, government, sent, lord, durham, to, investigate, the, causes, he, recommended, responsible, government, be, granted, and, lower, and, upper, canada, be, re, joined, in, an, attempt, to, assimilate, the, french, canadians, accordingly, the, two, colonies, were, merged, into, the, province, of, canada, by, the, act, of, union, 1840, with, the, capital, initially, at, kingston, and, upper, canada, becoming, known, as, canada, west, responsible, government, was, achieved, in, 1848, there, were, heavy, waves, of, immigration, in, the, 1840s, and, the, population, of, canada, west, more, than, doubled, by, 1851, over, the, previous, decade, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, the, english, speaking, population, of, canada, west, surpassed, the, french, speaking, population, of, canada, east, tilting, the, representative, balance, of, power, in, 1849, the, districts, of, southern, ontario, were, abolished, by, the, province, of, canada, and, county, governments, took, over, certain, municipal, responsibilities, the, province, of, canada, also, began, creating, districts, in, sparsely, populated, northern, ontario, with, the, establishment, of, algoma, district, and, nipissing, district, in, 1858, an, economic, boom, in, the, 1850s, coincided, with, railway, expansion, across, the, province, further, increasing, the, economic, strength, of, central, canada, with, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, and, a, reciprocity, agreement, in, place, with, the, united, states, various, industries, such, as, timber, mining, farming, and, alcohol, distilling, benefited, tremendously, a, political, stalemate, developed, in, the, 1850s, between, finely, balanced, political, groups, conservative, and, reform, groups, from, canada, west, and, canada, east, aligned, against, reform, and, liberal, groups, from, canada, east, each, group, having, some, support, from, french, canadian, and, english, canadian, legislators, there, was, also, a, fear, of, aggression, from, the, united, states, during, and, immediately, after, the, american, civil, war, these, factors, led, to, the, formation, of, the, great, coalition, in, the, elected, legislative, assembly, which, initiated, a, series, of, conferences, in, the, 1860s, to, effect, a, broader, federal, union, of, all, british, north, american, colonies, the, british, north, america, act, took, effect, on, july, 1, 1867, establishing, the, dominion, of, canada, initially, with, the, four, provinces, of, nova, scotia, new, brunswick, quebec, and, ontario, the, province, of, canada, was, divided, into, ontario, and, quebec, so, that, each, linguistic, group, would, have, its, own, province, both, quebec, and, ontario, were, required, by, section, 93, of, the, british, north, america, act, to, safeguard, existing, educational, rights, and, privileges, of, the, protestant, and, catholic, minorities, thus, separate, catholic, schools, and, school, boards, were, permitted, in, ontario, however, neither, province, had, a, constitutional, requirement, to, protect, its, french, or, english, speaking, minority, toronto, was, formally, established, as, ontario, s, provincial, capital, the, borders, of, ontario, its, new, name, in, 1867, were, provisionally, expanded, north, and, west, when, the, province, of, canada, was, formed, its, borders, were, not, entirely, clear, and, ontario, claimed, eventually, to, reach, all, the, way, to, the, rocky, mountains, and, arctic, ocean, with, canada, s, acquisition, of, rupert, s, land, ontario, was, interested, in, clearly, defining, its, borders, especially, since, some, of, the, new, areas, in, which, it, was, interested, were, rapidly, growing, after, the, federal, government, asked, ontario, to, pay, for, construction, in, the, new, disputed, area, the, province, asked, for, an, elaboration, on, its, limits, and, its, boundary, was, moved, north, to, the, 51st, parallel, north, once, constituted, as, a, province, ontario, proceeded, to, assert, its, economic, and, legislative, power, in, 1872, the, lawyer, oliver, mowat, became, premier, of, ontario, and, remained, as, premier, until, 1896, he, fought, for, provincial, rights, weakening, the, power, of, the, federal, government, in, provincial, matters, usually, through, well, argued, appeals, to, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, his, battles, with, the, federal, government, greatly, decentralized, canada, giving, the, provinces, far, more, power, than, john, a, macdonald, had, intended, he, consolidated, and, expanded, ontario, s, educational, and, provincial, institutions, created, districts, in, northern, ontario, and, fought, to, ensure, that, those, parts, of, northwestern, ontario, not, historically, part, of, upper, canada, the, vast, areas, north, and, west, of, the, lake, superior, hudson, bay, watershed, known, as, the, district, of, keewatin, would, become, part, of, ontario, a, victory, embodied, in, the, canada, ontario, boundary, act, 1889, he, also, presided, over, the, emergence, of, the, province, into, the, economic, powerhouse, of, canada, mowat, was, the, creator, of, what, is, often, called, empire, ontario, beginning, with, macdonald, s, national, policy, 1879, and, the, construction, of, the, canadian, pacific, railway, 1875, 1885, through, northern, ontario, and, the, canadian, prairies, to, british, columbia, ontario, manufacturing, and, industry, flourished, however, population, increases, slowed, after, a, large, recession, hit, the, province, in, 1893, thus, slowing, growth, drastically, but, for, only, a, few, years, many, newly, arrived, immigrants, and, others, moved, west, along, the, railway, to, the, prairie, provinces, and, british, columbia, sparsely, settling, northern, ontario, the, northern, and, western, boundaries, of, ontario, were, in, dispute, after, canadian, confederation, ontario, s, right, to, northwestern, ontario, was, determined, by, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, in, 1884, and, confirmed, by, the, canada, ontario, boundary, act, 1889, of, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, by, 1899, there, were, seven, northern, districts, algoma, manitoulin, muskoka, nipissing, parry, sound, rainy, river, and, thunder, bay, four, more, northern, districts, were, created, between, 1907, and, 1912, cochrane, kenora, sudbury, and, timiskaming, mineral, exploitation, accelerated, in, the, late, 19th, century, leading, to, the, rise, of, important, mining, centres, in, the, northeast, such, as, sudbury, cobalt, and, timmins, the, province, harnessed, its, water, power, to, generate, hydro, electric, power, and, created, the, state, controlled, hydro, electric, power, commission, of, ontario, later, ontario, hydro, the, availability, of, cheap, electric, power, further, facilitated, the, development, of, industry, the, ford, motor, company, of, canada, was, established, in, 1904, and, the, mclaughlin, motor, car, company, later, general, motors, canada, was, founded, in, 1907, the, motor, vehicle, industry, became, the, most, lucrative, industry, for, the, ontario, economy, during, the, 20th, century, in, july, 1912, the, conservative, government, of, james, whitney, issued, regulation, 17, which, severely, limited, the, availability, of, french, language, schooling, to, the, province, s, french,
