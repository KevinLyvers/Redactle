american, teenagers, and, young, adults, traveled, to, resort, areas, and, balnearios, throughout, mexico, during, spring, break, each, year, the, main, reason, students, head, to, mexico, is, the, drinking, age, of, 18, years, versus, 21, for, the, united, states, something, that, has, been, marketed, by, tour, operators, along, with, the, sun, and, ocean, this, has, become, attractive, since, the, 1990s, especially, since, more, traditional, spring, break, places, such, as, daytona, beach, florida, have, enacted, restrictions, on, drinking, and, other, behaviors, this, legislation, has, pushed, spring, break, tourism, to, various, parts, of, mexico, with, acapulco, as, one, of, the, top, destinations, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, canc, n, had, been, favored, as, the, spring, break, destination, of, choice, however, canc, n, has, taken, some, steps, to, control, the, reckless, behavior, associated, with, the, event, and, students, have, been, looking, for, someplace, new, this, led, many, more, to, choose, acapulco, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, for, many, travelers, the, flight, is, longer, and, more, expensive, than, to, canc, n, many, were, attracted, by, the, glitzy, hotels, on, the, south, side, and, acapulco, s, famous, nightlife, in, 2008, 22, 500, students, came, to, acapulco, for, spring, break, hotels, did, not, get, that, many, in, 2009, due, mostly, to, the, economic, situation, in, the, united, states, and, partially, because, of, scares, of, drug, related, violence, in, february, 2009, the, us, state, department, issued, a, travel, alert, directed, at, college, students, planning, spring, break, trips, to, acapulco, the, warning, a, result, of, violent, activity, springing, from, mexico, s, drug, cartel, d, b, cle, took, college, campuses, by, storm, with, some, schools, going, so, far, as, to, warn, their, students, about, the, risks, of, travel, to, mexico, over, spring, break, bill, o, reilly, devoted, a, segment, of, his, show, the, o, reilly, factor, to, urge, students, to, stay, away, from, acapulco, in, june, 2009, a, number, of, incidents, occurred, between, the, drug, cartel, and, the,

violence, against, travelers, on, spring, break, were, reported, nine, passenger, airlines, including, four, international, ones, fly, to, acapulco, international, airport, in, the, city, there, are, many, buses, and, taxi, services, one, can, take, to, get, from, place, to, place, but, most, of, the, locals, choose, to, walk, to, their, destinations, however, an, important, mode, of, transportation, is, the, government, subsidized, colectivo, cab, system, these, cabs, cost, 13, pesos, per, person, to, ride, but, they, are, not, private, the, driver, will, pick, up, more, passengers, as, long, as, seats, are, available, and, will, transport, them, to, their, destination, based, on, first, come, first, served, rules, the, colectivos, each, travel, a, designated, area, of, the, city, the, three, main, ones, being, costera, colosio, coloso, or, a, mixture, of, the, three, coloso, cabs, travel, mainly, to, old, acapulco, colosio, cabs, travel, through, most, of, the, tourist, area, of, acapulco, costera, cabs, drive, up, and, down, the, coast, of, acapulco, where, most, of, the, hotels, for, visitors, are, located, but, which, includes, some, of, old, acapulco, drivers, have, discretion, over, destinations, some, are, willing, to, travel, to, the, other, designated, areas, especially, during, slow, periods, of, the, day, the, bus, system, is, highly, complex, and, can, be, rather, confusing, to, an, outsider, as, far, as, transportation, goes, it, is, the, cheapest, form, other, than, walking, in, acapulco, the, most, expensive, buses, have, air, conditioning, while, the, cheaper, buses, do, not, for, tourists, the, acapulco, city, government, has, established, a, system, of, yellow, buses, with, acapulco, painted, on, the, side, of, them, these, buses, are, not, for, tourists, only, but, are, certainly, the, nicest, and, most, uniform, of, the, bus, systems, these, buses, travel, the, tourist, section, of, acapulco, driving, up, and, down, the, coast, there, are, buses, with, specific, routes, and, destinations, generally, written, on, their, windshields, or, shouted, out, by, a, barker, riding, in, the, front, seat, perhaps, the, most, unusual, thing, about, the, privately, operated, buses, is, the, fact, that, they, are, all, highly, decorated, and, personalized, with, decals, and, home, made, interior, designs, that, range, from, comic, book, scenes, to, pornography, and, even, to, hello, kitty, themes, the, bus, network, was, simplified, on, 25, june, 2016, with, the, implementation, of, the, acab, s, the, bus, rapid,
