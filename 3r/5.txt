asia, e, ay, zh, uk, also, e, ay, sh, is, the, largest, continent, in, the, world, by, both, land, area, and, population, it, covers, an, area, of, more, than, 44, million, square, kilometers, about, 30, of, earth, s, total, land, area, and, 8, of, earth, s, total, surface, area, the, continent, which, has, long, been, home, to, the, majority, of, the, human, population, was, the, site, of, many, of, the, first, civilizations, its, 4, 7, billion, people, constitute, roughly, 60, of, the, world, s, population, asia, shares, the, landmass, of, eurasia, with, europe, and, of, afro, eurasia, with, both, europe, and, africa, in, general, terms, it, is, bounded, on, the, east, by, the, pacific, ocean, on, the, south, by, the, indian, ocean, and, on, the, north, by, the, arctic, ocean, the, border, of, asia, with, europe, is, a, historical, and, cultural, construct, as, there, is, no, clear, physical, and, geographical, separation, between, them, a, commonly, accepted, division, places, asia, to, the, east, of, the, suez, canal, separating, it, from, africa, and, to, the, east, of, the, turkish, straits, the, ural, mountains, and, ural, river, and, to, the, south, of, the, caucasus, mountains, and, the, caspian, and, black, seas, separating, it, from, europe, since, the, concept, of, asia, derives, from, the, term, for, the, eastern, region, from, a, european, perspective, asia, is, the, remaining, vast, area, of, eurasia, minus, europe, thefore, asia, is, a, region, where, various, independent, cultures, coexist, rather, than, sharing, a, single, culture, and, the, boundary, between, europe, is, somewhat, arbitrary, and, has, moved, since, its, first, conception, in, classical, antiquity, the, division, of, eurasia, into, two, continents, reflects, east, west, cultural, differences, some, of, which, vary, on, a, spectrum, china, and, india, traded, places, as, the, largest, economies, in, the, world, from, 1, to, 1800, ce, china, was, a, major, economic, power, for, much, of, recorded, history, with, the, highest, gdp, per, capita, until, 1500, the, silk, road, became, the, main, east, west, trading, route, in, the, asian, hinterlands, while, the, straits, of, malacca, stood, as, a, major, sea, route, asia, has, exhibited, economic, dynamism, as, well, as, robust, population, growth, during, the, 20th, century, but, overall, population, growth, has, since, fallen, asia, was, the, birthplace, of, most, of, the, world, s, mainstream, religions, including, hinduism, zoroastrianism, judaism, jainism, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, christianity, islam, sikhism, and, many, other, religions, asia, varies, greatly, across, and, within, its, regions, with, regard, to, ethnic, groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical, ties, and, government, systems, it, also, has, a, mix, of, many, different, climates, ranging, from, the, equatorial, south, via, the, hot, deserts, in, parts, of, west, asia, central, asia, and, south, asia, temperate, areas, in, the, east, and, the, continental, centre, to, vast, subarctic, and, polar, areas, in, north, asia, the, boundary, between, asia, and, africa, is, the, suez, canal, the, gulf, of, suez, the, red, sea, and, the, bab, el, mandeb, this, makes, egypt, a, transcontinental, country, with, the, sinai, peninsula, in, asia, and, the, remainder, of, the, country, in, africa, the, threefold, division, of, the, old, world, into, africa, asia, and, europe, has, been, in, use, since, the, 6th, century, bce, due, to, greek, geographers, such, as, anaximander, and, hecataeus, anaximander, placed, the, boundary, between, asia, and, europe, along, the, phasis, river, the, modern, rioni, river, in, georgia, of, caucasus, from, its, mouth, by, poti, on, the, black, sea, coast, through, the, surami, pass, and, along, the, kura, river, to, the, caspian, sea, a, convention, still, followed, by, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bce, during, the, hellenistic, period, this, convention, was, revised, and, the, boundary, between, europe, and, asia, was, now, considered, to, be, the, tanais, the, modern, don, river, this, is, the, convention, used, by, roman, era, authors, such, as, posidonius, strabo, and, ptolemy, the, border, between, asia, and, europe, was, historically, defined, by, european, academics, in, sweden, five, years, after, peter, s, death, in, 1730, philip, johan, von, strahlenberg, published, a, new, atlas, proposing, the, ural, mountains, as, the, border, of, asia, tatishchev, announced, that, he, had, proposed, the, idea, to, von, strahlenberg, the, latter, had, suggested, the, emba, river, as, the, lower, boundary, over, the, next, century, various, proposals, were, made, until, the, ural, river, prevailed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, border, had, been, moved, perforce, from, the, black, sea, to, the, caspian, sea, into, which, the, ural, river, projects, the, border, between, the, black, sea, and, the, caspian, is, usually, placed, along, the, crest, of, the, caucasus, mountains, although, it, is, sometimes, placed, further, north, the, border, between, asia, and, oceania, is, usually, placed, somewhere, in, the, indonesia, archipelago, specifically, in, eastern, indonesia, the, wallace, line, separates, the, asian, and, wallacea, biogeographical, realms, a, transition, zone, of, deep, water, straits, between, the, asian, and, australian, continental, shelves, weber, s, line, split, the, region, in, two, with, regard, to, the, balance, of, fauna, between, asian, origin, or, australo, papuan, origin, wallacea, s, eastern, boundary, with, sahul, is, represented, by, the, lydekker, s, line, the, maluku, islands, except, the, aru, islands, are, often, considered, to, lie, on, the, border, of, southeast, asia, with, the, aru, islands, and, western, new, guinea, to, the, east, of, the, lydekker, s, line, being, wholly, part, of, oceania, as, both, lie, on, the, australian, continental, plate, culturally, the, wallacea, region, denoted, the, transition, between, austronesian, and, melanesian, people, with, varying, degrees, of, intermixing, between, the, two, in, general, the, further, west, and, coastal, a, region, is, the, stronger, the, austronesian, influences, and, the, further, east, and, inland, a, region, is, the, stronger, the, melanesian, influences, the, terms, southeast, asia, and, oceania, devised, in, the, 19th, century, have, had, several, vastly, different, geographic, meanings, since, their, inception, the, chief, factor, in, determining, which, islands, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, are, asian, has, been, the, location, of, the, colonial, possessions, of, the, various, empires, there, not, all, european, lewis, and, wigen, assert, the, narrowing, of, southeast, asia, to, its, present, boundaries, was, thus, a, gradual, process, the, bering, strait, and, bering, sea, separate, the, landmasses, of, asia, and, north, america, as, well, as, forming, the, international, boundary, between, russia, and, the, united, states, this, national, and, continental, boundary, separates, the, diomede, islands, in, the, bering, strait, with, big, diomede, in, russia, and, little, diomede, in, the, united, states, the, aleutian, islands, are, an, island, chain, extending, westward, from, the, alaskan, peninsula, toward, russia, s, komandorski, islands, and, kamchatka, peninsula, most, of, them, are, always, associated, with, north, america, except, for, the, westernmost, near, islands, group, which, is, on, asia, s, continental, shelf, beyond, the, north, aleutians, basin, and, on, rare, occasions, could, be, associated, with, asia, which, could, then, allow, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, as, well, as, the, united, states, itself, to, be, considered, a, transcontinental, state, the, aleutian, islands, are, sometimes, associated, with, oceania, owing, to, their, status, as, remote, pacific, islands, and, their, proximity, to, the, pacific, plate, this, is, extremely, rare, however, due, to, their, non, tropical, biogeography, as, well, as, their, inhabitants, who, have, historically, been, related, to, indigenous, americans, st, lawrence, island, in, the, northern, bering, sea, belongs, to, alaska, and, may, be, associated, with, either, continent, but, is, almost, always, considered, part, of, north, america, as, with, the, rat, islands, in, the, aleutian, chain, at, their, nearest, points, alaska, and, russia, are, separated, by, only, 4, kilometres, 2, 5, miles, geographical, asia, is, a, cultural, artifact, of, european, conceptions, of, the, world, beginning, with, the, ancient, greeks, being, imposed, onto, other, cultures, an, imprecise, concept, causing, endemic, contention, about, what, it, means, asia, does, not, exactly, correspond, to, the, cultural, borders, of, its, various, types, of, constituents, from, the, time, of, herodotus, a, minority, of, geographers, have, rejected, the, three, continent, system, europe, africa, asia, on, the, grounds, that, there, is, no, substantial, physical, separation, between, them, for, example, sir, barry, cunliffe, the, emeritus, professor, of, european, archeology, at, oxford, argues, that, europe, has, been, geographically, and, culturally, merely, the, western, excrescence, of, the, continent, of, asia, geographically, asia, is, the, major, eastern, constituent, of, the, continent, of, eurasia, with, europe, being, a, northwestern, peninsula, of, the, landmass, asia, europe, and, africa, make, up, a, single, continuous, landmass, afro, eurasia, and, share, a, common, continental, shelf, almost, all, of, europe, and, a, major, part, of, asia, sit, atop, the, eurasian, plate, adjoined, on, the, south, by, the, arabian, and, indian, plate, and, with, the, easternmost, part, of, siberia, east, of, the, chersky, range, on, the, north, american, plate, the, term, asia, is, believed, to, originate, in, the, bronze, age, toponym, assuwa, hittite, romanized, a, u, wa, which, originally, referred, only, to, a, portion, of, northwestern, anatolia, the, term, appears, in, hittite, records, recounting, how, a, confederation, of, assuwan, states, including, troy, unsuccessfully, rebelled, against, the, hittite, king, tudhaliya, i, around, 1400, bce, roughly, contemporary, linear, b, documents, contain, the, term, aswia, mycenaean, greek, romanized, a, si, wi, ja, seemingly, in, reference, to, captives, from, the, same, area, herodotus, used, the, term, in, reference, to, anatolia, and, the, territory, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, contrast, to, greece, and, egypt, he, reports, that, greeks, assumed, that, asia, was, named, after, the, wife, of, prometheus, but, that, lydians, say, it, was, named, after, asies, son, of, cotys, who, passed, the, name, on, to, a, tribe, at, sardis, in, greek, mythology, asia, or, was, the, name, of, a, nymph, or, titan, goddess, of, lydia, the, iliad, attributed, by, the, ancient, greeks, to, homer, mentions, two, phrygians, in, the, trojan, war, named, asios, an, adjective, meaning, asian, and, also, a, marsh, or, lowland, containing, a, marsh, in, lydia, as, the, term, was, later, adopted, by, the, romans, who, used, it, in, reference, to, the, province, of, asia, located, in, western, anatolia, one, of, the, first, writers, to, use, asia, as, a, name, of, the, whole, continent, was, pliny, the, history, of, asia, can, be, seen, as, the, distinct, histories, of, several, peripheral, coastal, regions, east, asia, south, asia, southeast, asia, central, asia, and, west, asia, the, coastal, periphery, was, home, to, some, of, the, world, s, earliest, known, civilizations, each, of, them, developing, around, fertile, river, valleys, the, civilizations, in, mesopotamia, the, indus, valley, and, the, yellow, river, shared, many, similarities, these, civilizations, may, well, have, exchanged, technologies, and, ideas, such, as, mathematics, and, the, wheel, other, innovations, such, as, writing, seem, to, have, been, developed, individually, in, each, area, cities, states, and, empires, developed, in, these, lowlands, the, central, steppe, region, had, long, been, inhabited, by, horse, mounted, nomads, who, could, reach, all, areas, of, asia, from, the, steppes, the, earliest, postulated, expansion, out, of, the, steppe, is, that, of, the, indo, europeans, who, spread, their, languages, into, west, asia, south, asia, and, the, borders, of, china, where, the, tocharians, resided, the, northernmost, part, of, asia, including, much, of, siberia, was, largely, inaccessible, to, the, steppe, nomads, owing, to, the, dense, forests, climate, and, tundra, these, areas, remained, very, sparsely, populated, the, center, and, the, peripheries, were, mostly, kept, separated, by, mountains, and, deserts, the, caucasus, and, himalaya, mountains, and, the, karakum, and, gobi, deserts, formed, barriers, that, the, steppe, horsemen, could, cross, only, with, difficulty, while, the, urban, city, dwellers, were, more, advanced, technologically, and, socially, in, many, cases, they, could, do, little, in, a, military, aspect, to, defend, against, the, mounted, hordes, of, the, steppe, however, the, lowlands, did, not, have, enough, open, grasslands, to, support, a, large, equestrian, force, for, this, and, other, reasons, the, nomads, who, conquered, states, in, china, india, and, the, middle, east, often, found, themselves, adapting, to, the, local, more, affluent, societies, the, islamic, caliphate, s, defeats, of, the, byzantine, and, persian, empires, led, to, west, asia, and, southern, parts, of, central, asia, and, western, parts, of, south, asia, under, its, control, during, its, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, islam, also, spread, over, centuries, to, the, southern, regions, of, india, and, southeast, asia, through, trade, along, the, maritime, silk, road, the, mongol, empire, conquered, a, large, part, of, asia, in, the, 13th, century, an, area, extending, from, china, to, europe, before, the, mongol, invasion, song, dynasty, reportedly, had, approximately, 120, million, citizens, the, 1300, census, which, followed, the, invasion, reported, roughly, 60, million, people, the, black, death, one, of, the, most, devastating, pandemics, in, human, history, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, arid, plains, of, central, asia, where, it, then, travelled, along, the, silk, road, the, russian, empire, began, to, expand, into, asia, from, the, 17th, century, and, would, eventually, take, control, of, all, of, siberia, and, most, of, central, asia, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, ottoman, empire, controlled, anatolia, most, of, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, the, balkans, from, the, mid, 16th, century, onward, in, the, 17th, century, the, manchu, conquered, china, and, established, the, qing, dynasty, the, islamic, mughal, empire, preceded, by, the, delhi, sultanate, of, the, 13th, to, early, 16th, century, and, the, hindu, maratha, empire, controlled, much, of, india, in, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, respectively, western, imperialism, in, asia, coincided, with, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, west, and, the, dethroning, of, india, and, china, as, the, world, s, foremost, economies, the, british, empire, first, became, dominant, in, south, asia, with, most, of, the, region, being, conquered, by, british, traders, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, before, falling, under, direct, british, rule, after, a, failed, 1857, revolt, the, 1869, completion, of, the, suez, canal, which, increased, british, access, to, india, went, on, to, further, european, influence, over, asia, around, this, time, western, powers, started, to, dominate, china, in, what, later, became, known, as, the, century, of, humiliation, with, the, british, supported, opium, trade, and, later, opium, wars, resulting, in, china, being, forced, into, an, unprecedented, situation, of, importing, more, than, it, exported, foreign, domination, of, china, was, furthered, by, the, japanese, colonial, empire, which, controlled, some, of, east, asia, and, briefly, much, of, southeast, asia, which, had, earlier, been, taken, over, by, the, british, dutch, and, french, in, the, late, 19th, century, new, guinea, and, the, pacific, islands, japan, s, domination, was, enabled, by, its, rapid, rise, that, had, taken, place, during, the, meiji, era, of, the, late, 19th, century, in, which, it, applied, industrial, knowledge, learned, from, the, west, and, thus, overtook, the, rest, of, asia, one, significant, influence, on, japan, had, been, the, united, states, which, had, begun, projecting, influence, across, the, pacific, after, its, early, to, mid, 19th, century, westward, expansion, the, breakup, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, early, 20th, century, led, to, the, middle, east, also, being, contested, and, partitioned, by, the, british, and, french, with, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, and, the, wartime, ruination, of, europe, and, imperial, japan, many, countries, in, asia, were, able, to, rapidly, free, themselves, of, colonial, rule, the, independence, of, india, came, along, with, the, carving, out, of, a, separate, nation, for, the,

economies, of, the, world, by, the, 21st, century, india, has, also, grown, significantly, because, of, economic, liberalisation, that, started, in, the, 1990s, with, extreme, poverty, now, below, 20, india, and, china, s, rise, has, coincided, with, growing, tension, between, the, two, with, the, indo, pacific, now, an, actively, contested, area, between, china, and, counterbalancing, forces, asia, is, the, largest, continent, on, earth, it, covers, 9, of, the, earth, s, total, surface, area, or, 30, of, its, land, area, and, has, the, longest, coastline, at, 62, 800, kilometres, 39, 022,

climate, features, climates, range, from, arctic, and, subarctic, in, siberia, to, tropical, in, southern, india, and, southeast, asia, it, is, moist, across, southeast, sections, and, dry, across, much, of, the, interior, some, of, the, largest, daily, temperature, ranges, on, earth, occur, in, western, sections, of, asia, the, monsoon, circulation, dominates, across, southern, and, eastern,

accounts, for, the, majority, of, the, human, population, warming, since, the, 20th, century, is, increasing, the, threat, of, heatwaves, across, the, entire, continent, 1459, heatwaves, lead, to, increased, mortality, and, the, demand, for, air, conditioning, is, rapidly, accelerating, as, the, result, by, 2080, around, 1, billion, people, in, the, cities, of, south, and, southeast, asia, are, expected, to, experience, around, a, month, of, extreme, heat, every, year, 1460, the, impacts, on, water, cycle, are, more, complicated, already, arid, regions, primarily, located, in, west, asia, and, central, asia, will, see, more, droughts, while, areas, of, east, southeast, and, south, asia, which, are, already, wet, due, to, the, monsoons, will, experience, more, flooding, 1459, the, waters, around, asia, are, subjected, to, the, same, impacts, as, elsewhere, such, as, the, increased, warming, and, ocean, acidification, 1465, there, are, many, coral, reefs, in, the, region, and, they, are, highly, vulnerable, to, climate, change, 1459, to, the, point, practically, all, of, them, will, be, lost, if, the, warming, exceeds, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, asia, s, distinctive, mangrove, ecosystems, are, also, highly, vulnerable, to, sea, level, rise, 1459, asia, also, has, more, countries, with, large, coastal, populations, than, any, other, continent, which, would, cause, large, economic, impacts, from, sea, level, rise, 1459, water, supplies, in, the, hindu, kush, region, will, become, more, unstable, as, its, enormous, glaciers, known, as, the, asian, water, towers, gradually, melt, 1459, these, changes, to, water, cycle, also, affect, vector, borne, disease, distribution, with, malaria, and, dengue, fever, expected, to, become, more, prominent, in, the, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, 1459, food, security, will, become, more, uneven, and, south, asian, countries, could, experience, significant, impacts, from, global, food, price, volatility, 1494, historical, emissions, from, asia, are, lower, than, those, from, europe, and, north, america, however, china, has, been, the, single, largest, emitter, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, 21st, century, while, india, is, the, third, largest, as, a, whole, asia, currently, accounts, for, 36, of, world, s, primary, energy, consumption, which, is, expected, to, increase, to, 48, by, 2050, by, 2040, it, is, also, expected, to, account, for, 80, of, the, world, s, coal, and, 26, of, the, world, s, natural, gas, consumption, 1468, while, the, united, states, remains, the, world, s, largest, oil, consumer, by, 2050, it, is, projected, to, move, to, third, place, behind, china, and, india, 1470, while, nearly, half, of, the, world, s, new, renewable, energy, capacity, is, built, in, asia, 1470, this, is, not, yet, sufficient, in, order, to, meet, the, goals, of, the, paris, agreement, they, imply, that, the, renewables, would, account, for, 35, of, total, energy, consumption, in, asia, by, 2030, 1471, asia, has, the, largest, continental, economy, in, the, world, by, both, gdp, nominal, and, ppp, values, and, is, the, fastest, growing, economic, region, as, of, 2023, china, is, by, far, the, largest, economy, on, the, continent, making, up, nearly, half, of, the, continent, s, economy, by, gdp, nominal, it, is, followed, by, japan, india, south, korea, indonesia, saudi, arabia, and, turkey, which, are, all, ranked, among, the, top, 20, largest, economies, both, by, nominal, and, ppp, values, based, on, global, office, locations, 2011, asia, dominated, the, office, locations, with, 4, of, the, top, 5, being, in, asia, hong, kong, singapore, tokyo, and, seoul, around, 68, percent, of, international, firms, have, an, office, in, hong, kong, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early,
