the, channel, islands, are, an, archipelago, in, the, english, channel, off, the, french, coast, of, normandy, they, are, divided, into, two, crown, dependencies, the, bailiwick, of, jersey, which, is, the, largest, of, the, islands, and, the, bailiwick, of, guernsey, consisting, of, guernsey, alderney, sark, herm, and, some, smaller, islands, historically, they, are, the, remnants, of, the, duchy, of, normandy, although, they, are, not, part, of, the, united, kingdom, the, uk, is, responsible, for, the, defence, and, international, relations, of, the, islands, as, it, is, for, the, other, crown, dependency, the, isle, of, man, and, the, british, overseas, territories, the, crown, dependencies, are, neither, members, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, nor, part, of, the, european, union, they, have, a, total, population, of, about, 171, 916, and, the, bailiwicks, capitals, saint, helier, and, saint, peter, port, have, populations, of, 33, 500, and, 18, 207, respectively, channel, islands, is, a, geographical, term, not, a, political, unit, the, two, bailiwicks, have, been, administered, separately, since, the, late, 13th, century, each, has, its, own, independent, laws, elections, and, representative, bodies, although, in, modern, times, politicians, from, the, islands, legislatures, are, in, regular, contact, any, institution, common, to, both, is, the, exception, rather, than, the, rule, the, bailiwick, of, guernsey, is, divided, into, three, jurisdictions, guernsey, alderney, and, sark, each, with, its, own, legislature, although, there, are, a, few, pan, island, institutions, such, as, the, channel, islands, brussels, office, the, director, of, civil, aviation, and, the, channel, islands, financial, ombudsman, which, are, actually, joint, ventures, between, the, bailiwicks, these, tend, to, be, established, structurally, as, equal, projects, between, guernsey, and, jersey, otherwise, entities, whose, names, imply, membership, of, both, guernsey, and, jersey, might, in, fact, be, from, one, bailiwick, only, for, instance, the, international, stock, exchange, is, in, saint, peter, port, and, therefore, is, in, guernsey, the, term, channel, islands, began, to, be, used, around, 1830, possibly, first, by, the, royal, navy, as, a, collective, name, for, the, islands, 158, the, term, refers, only, to, the, archipelago, to, the, west, of, the, cotentin, peninsula, other, populated, islands, located, in, the, english, channel, and, close, to, the, coast, of, britain, such, as, the, isle, of, wight, hayling, island, and, portsea, island, are, not, regarded, as, channel, islands, the, two, major, islands, are, jersey, and, guernsey, they, make, up, 99, of, the, population, and, 92, of, the, area, these, lie, off, alderney, these, lie, off, guernsey, the, names, of, the, larger, islands, in, the, archipelago, in, general, have, the, ey, suffix, whilst, those, of, the, smaller, ones, have, the, hou, suffix, these, are, believed, to, be, from, the, old, norse, ey, island, and, holmr, islet, the, chausey, islands, south, of, jersey, are, not, generally, included, in, the, geographical, definition, of, the, channel, islands, but, are, occasionally, described, in, english, as, french, channel, islands, in, view, of, their, french, jurisdiction, they, were, historically, linked, to, the, duchy, of, normandy, but, they, are, part, of, the, french, territory, along, with, continental, normandy, and, not, part, of, the, british, isles, or, of, the, channel, islands, in, a, political, sense, they, are, an, incorporated, part, of, the, commune, of, granville, manche, while, they, are, popular, with, visitors, from, france, channel, islanders, can, only, visit, them, by, private, or, charter, boats, as, there, are, no, direct, transport, links, from, the, other, islands, in, official, jersey, standard, french, the, channel, islands, are, called, les, de, la, manche, while, in, france, the, term, les, anglo, normandes, anglo, norman, isles, is, used, to, refer, to, the, british, channel, islands, in, contrast, to, other, islands, in, the, channel, chausey, is, referred, to, as, an, le, normande, as, opposed, to, anglo, normande, les, normandes, and, archipel, normand, have, also, historically, been, used, in, channel, island, french, to, refer, to, the, islands, as, a, whole, the, very, large, tidal, variation, provides, an, environmentally, rich, inter, tidal, zone, around, the, islands, and, some, islands, such, as, burhou, the, cr, hous, and, the, minquiers, have, been, designated, ramsar, sites, the, waters, around, the, islands, include, the, following, the, highest, point, in, the, islands, is, les, platons, in, jersey, at, 143, metres, 469, ft, above, sea, level, the, lowest, point, is, the, english, channel, sea, level, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, occupation, of, the, channel, islands, has, been, dated, to, 250, 000, years, ago, when, they, were, attached, to, the, landmass, of, continental, europe, the, islands, became, detached, by, rising, sea, levels, in, the, mesolithic, period, the, numerous, dolmens, and, other, archaeological, sites, extant, and, recorded, in, history, demonstrate, the, existence, of, a, population, large, enough, and, organised, enough, to, undertake, constructions, of, considerable, size, and, sophistication, such, as, the, burial, mound, at, la, hougue, bie, in, jersey, or, the, statue, menhirs, of, guernsey, hoards, of, armorican, coins, have, been, excavated, providing, evidence, of, trade, and, contact, in, the, iron, age, period, evidence, for, roman, settlement, is, sparse, although, evidently, the, islands, were, visited, by, roman, officials, and, traders, the, roman, name, for, the, channel, islands, was, i, lenuri, lenur, islands, and, is, included, in, the, peutinger, table, 4, the, traditional, latin, names, used, for, the, islands, caesarea, for, jersey, sarnia, for, guernsey, riduna, for, alderney, derive, possibly, mistakenly, from, the, antonine, itinerary, gallo, roman, culture, was, adopted, to, an, unknown, extent, in, the, islands, in, the, sixth, century, christian, missionaries, visited, the, islands, samson, of, dol, helier, marculf, and, magloire, are, among, saints, associated, with, the, islands, in, the, sixth, century, they, were, already, included, in, the, diocese, of, coutances, where, they, remained, until, the, reformation, there, were, probably, some, celtic, britons, who, settled, on, the, islands, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, ad, the, indigenous, celts, of, great, britain, and, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, welsh, cornish, and, bretons, who, had, emigrated, from, great, britain, in, the, face, of, invading, anglo, saxons, but, there, were, not, enough, of, them, to, leave, any, trace, and, the, islands, continued, to, be, ruled, by, the, king, of, the, franks, and, its, church, remained, part, of, the, diocese, of, coutances, from, the, beginning, of, the, ninth, century, norse, raiders, appeared, on, the, coasts, norse, settlement, eventually, succeeded, initial, attacks, and, it, is, from, this, period, that, many, place, names, of, norse, origin, appear, including, the, modern, names, of, the, islands, in, 933, the, islands, were, granted, to, william, i, longsword, by, raoul, the, king, of, western, francia, and, annexed, to, the, duchy, of, normandy, in, 1066, william, ii, of, normandy, invaded, and, conquered, england, becoming, william, i, of, england, also, known, as, william, the, conqueror, in, the, period, 1204, 1214, king, john, lost, the, angevin, lands, in, northern, france, including, mainland, normandy, to, king, philip, ii, of, france, but, managed, to, retain, control, of, the, channel, islands, in, 1259, his, successor, henry, iii, of, england, by, the, treaty, of, paris, officially, surrendered, his, claim, and, title, to, the, duchy, of, normandy, while, retaining, the, channel, islands, as, peer, of, france, and, feudal, vassal, of, the, king, of, france, since, then, the, channel, islands, have, been, governed, as, two, separate, bailiwicks, and, were, never, absorbed, into, the, kingdom, of, england, nor, its, successor, kingdoms, of, great, britain, or, the, united, kingdom, during, the, hundred, years, war, the, channel, islands, were, part, of, the, french, territory, recognizing, the, claims, of, the, english, kings, to, the, french, throne, the, islands, were, invaded, by, the, french, in, 1338, who, held, some, territory, until, 1345, edward, iii, of, england, granted, a, charter, in, july, 1341, to, jersey, guernsey, sark, and, alderney, confirming, their, customs, and, laws, to, secure, allegiance, to, the, english, crown,

of, great, loyalty, shown, to, the, crown, exemption, forever, from, english, tolls, customs, and, duties, 5, 10, jersey, was, occupied, by, the, french, in, 1461, as, part, of, an, exchange, for, helping, the, lancastrians, fight, against, the, yorkists, during, the, war, of, the, roses, it, was, retaken, by, the, yorkists, in, 1468, in, 1483, a, papal, bull, decreed, that, the, islands, would, be, neutral, during, time, of, war, this, privilege, of, neutrality, enabled, islanders, to, trade, with, both, france, and, england, and, was, respected, until, 1689, when, it, was, abolished, by, order, in, council, following, the, glorious, revolution, in, great, britain, various, attempts, to, transfer, the, islands, from, the, diocese, of, coutances, to, nantes, 1400, salisbury, 1496, and, winchester, 1499, had, little, effect, until, an, order, in, council, of, 1569, brought, the, islands, formally, into, the, diocese, of, winchester, control, by, the, bishop, of, winchester, was, ineffectual, as, the, islands, had, turned, overwhelmingly, calvinist, and, the, episcopacy, was, not, restored, until, 1620, in, jersey, and, 1663, in, guernsey, after, the, loss, of, calais, in, 1558, the, channel, islands, were, the, last, remaining, english, holdings, in, france, and, the, only, french, territory, that, was, controlled, by, the, english, kings, as, kings, of, france, this, situation, lasted, until, the, english, kings, dropped, their, title, and, claims, to, the, french, throne, in, 1801, confirming, the, channel, islands, in, a, situation, of, a, crown, dependency, under, the, sovereignty, of, neither, great, britain, nor, france, but, of, the, british, crown, directly, sark, in, the, 16th, century, was, uninhabited, until, colonised, from, jersey, in, the, 1560s, the, grant, of, seigneurship, from, elizabeth, i, of, england, in, 1565, forms, the, basis, of, sark, s, constitution, today, during, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, jersey, held, out, strongly, for, the, royalist, cause, providing, refuge, for, charles, prince, of, wales, in, 1646, and, 1649, 1650, while, the, more, strongly, presbyterian, guernsey, more, generally, favoured, the, parliamentary, cause, although, castle, cornet, was, held, by, royalists, and, did, not, surrender, until, october, 1651, the, islands, acquired, commercial, and, political, interests, in, the, north,

existing, today, were, built, in, that, time, in, saint, peter, port, a, large, part, of, the, harbour, had, been, built, by, 1865, the, islands, were, occupied, by, the, german, army, during, world, war, ii, the, british, government, demilitarised, the, islands, in, june, 1940, and, the, lieutenant, governors, were, withdrawn, on, 21, june, leaving, the, insular, administrations, to, continue, government, as, best, they, could, under, impending, military, occupation, before, german, troops, landed, between, 30, june, and, 4, july, 1940, evacuation, took, place, many, young, men, had, already, left, to, join, the, allied, armed, forces, as, volunteers, 6, 600, out, of, 50, 000, left, jersey, while, 17, 000, out, of, 42, 000, left, guernsey, thousands, of, children, were, evacuated,

germans, built, four, prison, camps, which, housed, approximately, 6, 000, people, of, whom, over, 700, died, due, to, the, destruction, of, documents, it, is, impossible, to, state, how, many, forced, workers, died, in, the, other, islands, some, have, claimed, that, alderney, had, the, only, nazi, concentration, camps, on, british, soil, others, have, pointed, out, that, technically, alderney, was, not, british, soil, the, royal, navy, blockaded, the, islands, from, time, to, time, particularly, following, the, invasion, of, normandy, in, june, 1944, there, was, considerable, hunger, and, privation, during, the, five, years, of, german, occupation, particularly, in, the, final, months, when, the, population, was, close, to, starvation, intense, negotiations, resulted, in, some, humanitarian, aid, being, sent, via, the, red, cross, leading, to, the, arrival, of, red, cross, parcels, in, the, supply, ship, ss, vega, in, december, 1944, the, german, occupation, of, 1940, 45, was, harsh, over, 2, 000, islanders, were, deported, by, the, germans, and, some, jews, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, partisan, resistance, and, retribution, accusations, of, collaboration, and, slave, labour, also, occurred, many, spaniards, initially, refugees, from, the, spanish, civil, war, were, brought, to, the, islands, to, build, fortifications, later, russians, and, central, europeans, continued, the, work, many, land, mines, were, laid, with, 65, 718, land, mines, laid, in, jersey, alone, there, was, no, resistance, movement, in, the, channel, islands, on, the, scale, of, that, in, mainland, france, this, has, been, ascribed, to, a, range, of, factors, including, the, physical, separation, of, the, islands, the, density, of, troops, up, to, one, german, for, every, two, islanders, the, small, size, of, the, islands, precluding, any, hiding, places, for, resistance, groups, and, the, absence, of, the, gestapo, from, the, occupying, forces, moreover, much, of, the, population, of, military, age, had, already, joined, the, british, army, the, end, of, the, occupation, came, after, ve, day, on, 8, may, 1945, with, jersey, and, guernsey, being, liberated, on, 9, may, the, german, garrison, in, alderney, was, left, until, 16, may, and, it, was, one, of, the, last, of, the, nazi, german, remnants, to, surrender, the, first, evacuees, returned, on, the, first, sailing, from, great, britain, on, 23, june, but, the, people, of, alderney, were, unable, to, start, returning, until, december, 1945, many, of, the, evacuees, who, returned, home, had, difficulty, reconnecting, with, their, families, after, five, years, of, separation, following, the, liberation, of, 1945, reconstruction, led, to, a, transformation, of, the, economies, of, the, islands, attracting, immigration, and, developing, tourism, the, legislatures, were, reformed, and, non, party, governments, embarked, on, social, programmes, aided, by, the, incomes, from, offshore, finance, which, grew, rapidly, from, the, 1960s, the, islands, decided, not, to, join, the, european, economic, community, when, the, uk, joined, since, the, 1990s, declining, profitability, of, agriculture, and, tourism, has, challenged, the, governments, of, the, islands, the, channel, islands, fall, into, two, separate, self, governing, bailiwicks, the, bailiwick, of, guernsey, and, the, bailiwick, of, jersey, each, of, these, is, a, british, crown, dependency, and, neither, is, a, part, of, the, united, kingdom, they, have, been, parts, of, the, duchy, of, normandy, since, the, 10th, century, and, queen, elizabeth, ii, was, often, referred, to, by, her, traditional, and, conventional, title, of, duke, of, normandy, however, pursuant, to, the, treaty, of, paris, 1259, she, governed, in, her, right, as, the, queen, the, crown, in, right, of, jersey, and, the, crown, in, right, of, the, r, publique, of, the, bailiwick, of, guernsey, and, not, as, the, duke, this, notwithstanding, it, is, a, matter, of, local, pride, for, monarchists, to, treat, the, situation, otherwise, the, loyal, toast, at, formal, dinners, was, to, the, queen, our, duke, rather, than, to, her, majesty, the, queen, as, in, the, uk, the, queen, died, in, 2022, and, her, son, charles, iii, became, the, king, a, bailiwick, is, a, territory, administered, by, a, bailiff, although, the, words, derive, from, a, common, root, bail, to, give, charge, of, there, is, a, vast, difference, between, the, meanings, of, the, word, bailiff, in, great, britain, and, in, the, channel, islands, a, bailiff, in, britain, is, a, court, appointed, private, debt, collector, authorised, to, collect, judgment, debts, in, the, channel, islands, the, bailiff, in, each, bailiwick, is, the, civil, head, presiding, officer, of, the, states, and, also, head, of, the, judiciary, and, thus, the, most, important, citizen, in, the, bailiwick, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, existence, of, governmental, offices, such, as, the, bailiffs, with, multiple, roles, straddling, the, different, branches, of, government, came, under, increased, scrutiny, for, their, apparent, contravention, of, the, doctrine, of, separation, of, powers, most, notably, in, the, guernsey, case, of, mcgonnell, v, united, kingdom, 2000, 30, ehrr, 289, that, case, following, final, judgement, at, the, european, court, of, human, rights, became, part, of, the, impetus, for, much, recent, constitutional, change, particularly, the, constitutional, reform, act, 2005, 2005, c, 4, in, the, uk, including, the, separation, of, the, roles, of, the, lord, chancellor, the, abolition, of, the, house, of, lords, judicial, role, and, its, replacement, by, the, uk, supreme, court, the, islands, bailiffs, however, still, retain, their, historic, roles, the, systems, of, government, in, the, islands, date, from, norman, times, which, accounts, for, the, names, of, the, legislatures, the, states, derived, from, the, norman, tats, or, estates, i, e, the, crown, the, church, and, the, people, the, states, have, evolved, over, the, centuries, into, democratic, parliaments, the, uk, parliament, has, power, to, legislate, for, the, islands, but, acts, of, parliament, do, not, extend, to, the, islands, automatically, usually, an, act, gives, power, to, extend, its, application, to, the, islands, by, an, order, in, council, after, consultation, for, the, most, part, the, islands, legislate, for, themselves, each, island, has, its, own, primary, legislature, known, as, the, states, of, guernsey, and, the, states, of, jersey, with, chief, pleas, in, sark, and, the, states, of, alderney, the, channel, islands, are, not, represented, in, the, uk, parliament, laws, passed, by, the, states, are, given, royal, assent, by, the, king, in, council, to, whom, the, islands, governments, are, responsible, the, islands, have, never, been, part, of, the, european, union, and, thus, were, not, a, party, to, the, 2016, referendum, on, the, eu, membership, but, were, part, of, the, customs, territory, of, the, european, community, by, virtue, of, protocol, three, to, the, treaty, on, european, union, in, september, 2010, a, channel, islands, brussels, office, was, set, up, jointly, by, the, two, bailiwicks, to, develop, the, channel, islands, influence, with, the, eu, to, advise, the, channel, islands, governments, on, european, matters, and, to, promote, economic, links, with, the, eu, both, bailiwicks, are, members, of, the, british, irish, council, and, j, rriais, and, guern, siais, are,

is, the, clameur, de, haro, the, basis, of, the, legal, systems, of, both, bailiwicks, is, norman, customary, law, coutume, rather, than, the, english, common, law, although, elements, of, the, latter, have, become, established, over, time, islanders, are, full, british, citizens, but, were, not, classed, as, european, citizens, unless, by, descent, from, a, uk, national, any, british,
