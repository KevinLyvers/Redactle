french, polynesia, by, the, assembly, in, june, 2004, thanks, to, the, votes, of, two, non, aligned, assembly, members, this, resulted, in, several, years, of, political, instability, as, neither, the, pro, nor, the, anti, independence, camps, were, assured, of, a, majority, depending, on, the, votes, of, smaller, non, aligned, parties, representing, the, interests, of, the, distant, islands, of, french, polynesia, as, opposed, to, tahiti, temaru, was, toppled, from, the, presidency, of, french, polynesia, in, october, 2004, succeeded, by, flosse, who, was, toppled, in, march, 2005,

majority, in, the, assembly, of, french, polynesia, and, new, territorial, elections, were, held, in, february, 2008, to, solve, the, political, crisis, the, party, of, gaston, tong, sang, won, the, territorial, elections, but, that, did, not, solve, the, political, crisis, the, two, minority, parties, of, oscar, temaru, and, gaston, flosse, who, together, had, one, more, member, in, the, territorial, assembly, than, the, political, party, of, gaston, tong, sang, allied, to, prevent, gaston, tong, sang, from, becoming, president, of, french, polynesia, gaston, flosse, was, then, elected, president, of, french, polynesia, by, the, territorial, assembly, on, 23, february, 2008, with, the, support, of, the, pro, independence, party, led, by, oscar, temaru, while, oscar, temaru, was, elected, speaker, of, the, territorial, assembly, with, the, support, of, the, anti, independence, party, led, by, gaston, flosse, both, formed, a, coalition, cabinet, many, observers, doubted, that, the, alliance, between, the, anti, independence, gaston, flosse, and, the, pro, independence, oscar, temaru, designed, to, prevent, gaston, tong, sang, from, becoming, president, of, french, polynesia, could, last, very, long, at, the, french, municipal, elections, held, in, march, 2008, several, prominent, mayors, who, were, member, of, the, flosse, temaru, coalition, lost, their, offices, in, key, municipalities, of, french, polynesia, which, was, interpreted, as, a, disapproval, of, the, way, gaston, tong, sang, whose, party, french, polynesian, voters, had, placed, first, in, the, territorial, elections, the, month, before, had, been, prevented, from, becoming, president, of, french, polynesia, by, the, last, minute, alliance, between, flosse, and, temaru, s, parties, eventually, on, 15, april, 2008, the, government, of, gaston, flosse, was, toppled, by, a, constructive, vote, of, no, confidence, in, the, territorial, assembly, when, two, members, of, the, flosse, temaru, coalition, left, the, coalition, and, sided, with, tong, sang, s, party, tong, sang, s, majority, in, the, territorial, assembly, was, very, narrow, and, he, was, toppled, in, february, 2009, succeeded, by, temaru, supported, again, by, flosse, oscar, temaru, s, return, to, power, was, brief, as, he, fell, out, with, gaston, flosse, and, was, toppled, in, november, 2009, succeeded, by, gaston, tong, sang, tong, sang, remained, in, power, for, a, year, and, a, half, before, being, toppled, in, a, vote, of, no, confidence, in, april, 2011, and, succeeded, by, temaru, oscar, temaru, s,

governing, territories, temaru, lost, the, 2013, french, polynesian, legislative, election, by, a, wide, margin, only, two, weeks, before, the, united, nations, re, registered, french, polynesia, on, its, list, of, non, self, governing, territories, this, was, interpreted, by, political, analysts, as, a, rejection, by, french, polynesian, voters, of, temaru, s, push, for, independence, as, well, as, the, consequence, of, the, socioeconomic, crisis, affecting, french, polynesia, after, years, of, political, instability, and, corruption, scandals, gaston, flosse, whose, anti, independence, party, was, the, big, winner, of, the, 2013, election, succeeded, oscar, temaru, as, president, of, french, polynesia, in, may, 2013, but, he, was, removed, from, office, in, september, 2014, due, to,
