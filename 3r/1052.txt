penderyn, in, 1831, the, town, grew, rapidly, from, the, 1830s, onwards, when, the, marquess, of, bute, built, a, dock, which, eventually, linked, to, the, taff, vale, railway, cardiff, became, the, main, port, for, coal, exports, from, the, cynon, rhondda, and, rhymney, valleys, and, grew, in, population, at, a, rate, of, nearly, 80, per, cent, per, decade, between, 1840, and, 1870, much, of,

in, 1877, cardiff, faced, a, challenge, in, the, 1880s, when, david, davies, of, llandinam, and, the, barry, railway, company, promoted, rival, docks, at, barry, these, had, the, advantage, of, being, accessible, in, all, tides, david, davies, claimed, his, venture, would, cause, grass, to, grow, in, the, streets, of, cardiff, from, 1901, coal, exports, from, barry, surpassed, those, from, cardiff, but, the, administration, of, the, coal, trade, remained, centred, on, cardiff, in, particular, its, coal, exchange, where, the, price, of, coal, on, the, british, market, was, determined, and, the, first, million, pound, deal, was, struck, in, 1907, the, city, also, strengthened, its, industrial, base, when, the, owners, of, the, dowlais, ironworks, in, merthyr, who, would, later, form, part, of, guest, keen, and, nettlefolds, built, a, steelworks, close, to, the, docks, at, east, moors, which, lord, bute, opened, on, 4, february, 1891, cardiff, became, a, county, borough, on, 1, april, 1889, under, the, local, government, act, 1888, the, town, had, grown, rapidly, and, had, a, population, of, over, 123, 000, it, retained, its, county, borough, status, until, 1974, king, edward, vii,

museum, of, wales, the, welsh, national, war, memorial, and, the, university, of, wales, registry, building, but, it, was, denied, the, national, library, of, wales, partly, because, the, library, s, founder, sir, john, williams, considered, cardiff, to, have, a, non, welsh, population, after, a, brief, post, war, boom, cardiff, docks, entered, a, prolonged, decline, in, the, interwar, period, by, 1936, trade, was, at, less, than, half, its, value, in, 1913, reflecting, the, slump, in, demand, for, welsh, coal, bomb, damage, in, the, cardiff, blitz, of, world, war, ii, included, the, devastation, of, llandaff, cathedral, and, in, the, immediate, postwar, years, the, city, s, link, with, the, bute, family, came, to, an, end, the, city, was, recognised, as, the, capital, city, of, wales, on, 20, december, 1955, in, a, written, reply, by, the, home, secretary, gwilym, lloyd, george, caernarfon, had, also, vied, for, the, title, welsh, local, authorities, had, been, divided, only, 76, out, of, 161, chose, cardiff, in, a, 1924, poll, organised, by, the, south, wales, daily, news, the, subject, was, not, debated, again, until, 1950, and, meanwhile, cardiff, took, steps, to, promote, its, welshness, the, stalemate, between, cardiff, and, cities, such, as, caernarfon, and, aberystwyth, was, not, broken, until, cardiganshire, county, council, decided, to, support, cardiff, and, in, a, new, local, authority, vote, 134, out, of, 161, voted, for, cardiff, cardiff, therefore, celebrated, two, important, anniversaries, in, 2005, the, encyclopedia, of, wales, notes, that, the, decision, to, recognise, the, city, as, the, capital, of, wales, had, more, to, do, with, the, fact, that, it, contained, marginal, conservative, constituencies, than, any, reasoned, view, of, what, functions, a, welsh, capital, should, have, although, the, city, hosted, the, commonwealth, games, in, 1958, cardiff, only, became, a, centre, of, national, administration, with, the, establishment, of, the, welsh, office, in, 1964, which, later, prompted, the, creation, of, various, other, public, bodies, such, as, the, arts, council, of, wales, and, the, welsh, development, agency, most, of, which, were, based, in, cardiff, the, east, moors, steelworks, closed, in, 1978, and, cardiff, lost, population, in, the, 1980s, consistent, with, a, wider, pattern, of, counter, urbanisation, in, britain, however, it, recovered, to, become, one, of, the, few, cities, outside, london, where, population, grew, in, the, 1990s, during, this, period, the, cardiff, bay, development, corporation, was, promoting, the, redevelopment, of, south, cardiff, an, evaluation, of, the, regeneration, of, cardiff, bay, published, in, 2004, concluded, that, the, project, had, reinforced, the, competitive, position, of, cardiff, and, contributed, to, a, massive, improvement, in, the, quality, of, the, built, environment, although, it, had, failed, to, attract, the, major, inward, investors, originally, anticipated, in, the, 1997, welsh, devolution, referendum, cardiff, voters, rejected, the, establishment, of, the, national, assembly, for, wales, by, 55, 4, to, 44, 2, on, a, 47, turnout, which, denis, balsom, partly, ascribed, to, a, general, preference, in, cardiff, and, some, other, parts, of, wales, for, a, british, rather, than, exclusively, welsh, identity, the, relative, lack, of, local, support, for, the, assembly, and, difficulties, between, the, welsh, office, and, cardiff, council, in, acquiring, the, originally, preferred, venue, cardiff, city, hall, encouraged, other, local, authorities, to, bid, to, house, the, assembly, however, the, assembly, was, eventually, located, at, t, hywel, in, cardiff, bay, in, 1999, in, 2005, a, new, debating,
