the, south, pole, also, known, as, the, geographic, south, pole, or, terrestrial, south, pole, is, the, southernmost, point, on, earth, and, lies, antipodally, on, the, opposite, side, of, earth, from, the, north, pole, at, a, distance, of, 20, 004, km, 12, 430, miles, in, all, directions, it, is, one, of, the, two, points, where, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, intersects, its, surface, situated, on, the, continent, of, antarctica, it, is, the, site, of, the, united, states, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, which, was, established, in, 1956, and, has, been, permanently, staffed, since, that, year, the, geographic, south, pole, is, distinct, from, the, south, magnetic, pole, the, position, of, which, is, defined, based, on, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, south, pole, is, the, center, of, the, southern, hemisphere, 90, s, 0, e, 90, s, 0, e, 90, 0, for, most, purposes, the, geographic, south, pole, is, defined, as, the, southern, point, of, the, two, points, where, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, intersects, its, surface, the, other, being, the, geographic, north, pole, however, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, is, actually, subject, to, very, small, wobbles, polar, motion, so, this, definition, is, not, adequate, for, very, precise, work, the, geographic, coordinates, of, the, south, pole, are, usually, given, simply, as, 90, s, since, its, longitude, is, geometrically, undefined, and, irrelevant, when, a, longitude, is, desired, it, may, be, given, as, 0, at, the, south, pole, all, directions, face, north, for, this, reason, directions, at, the, pole, are, given, relative, to, grid, north, which, points, northward, along, the, prime, meridian, along, tight, latitude, circles, clockwise, is, east, and, counterclockwise, is, west, opposite, to, the, north, pole, the, geographic, south, pole, is, presently, located, on, the, continent, of, antarctica, although, this, has, not, been, the, case, for, all, of, earth, s, history, because, of, continental, drift, it, sits, atop, a, featureless, barren, windswept, and, icy, plateau, at, an, altitude, of, 2, 835, m, 9, 301, ft, above, sea, level, and, is, located, about, 1, 300, km, 810, mi, from, the, nearest, open, sea, at, the, bay, of, whales, the, ice, is, estimated, to, be, about, 2, 700, m, 8, 900, ft, thick, at, the, pole, so, the, land, surface, under, the, ice, sheet, is, actually, near, sea, level, the, polar, ice, sheet, is, moving, at, a, rate, of, roughly, 10, m, 33, ft, per, year, in, a, direction, between, 37, and, 40, west, of, grid, north, down, towards, the, weddell, sea, therefore, the, position, of, the, station, and, other, artificial, features, relative, to, the, geographic, pole, gradually, shift, over, time, the, geographic, south, pole, is, marked, by, a, stake, in, the, ice, alongside, a, small, sign, these, are, repositioned, each, year, in, a, ceremony, on, new, year, s, day, to, compensate, for, the, movement, of, the, ice, the, sign, records, the, respective, dates, that, roald, amundsen, and, robert, f, scott, reached, the, pole, followed, by, a, short, quotation, from, each, man, and, gives, the, elevation, as, 9, 301, ft, a, new, marker, stake, is, designed, and, fabricated, each, year, by, staff, at, the, site, the, ceremonial, south, pole, is, an, area, set, aside, for, photo, opportunities, at, the, south, pole, station, it, is, located, some, meters, from, the, geographic, south, pole, and, consists, of, a, metallic, sphere, on, a, short, barber, pole, surrounded, by, the, flags, of, the, original, antarctic, treaty, signatory, states, the, tent, was, erected, by, the, norwegian, expedition, led, by, roald, amundsen, on, its, arrival, on, 14, december, 1911, it, is, currently, buried, beneath, the, snow, and, ice, in, the, vicinity, of, the, pole, it, has, been, designated, a, historic, site, or, monument, hsm, 80, following, a, proposal, by, norway, to, the, antarctic, treaty, consultative, meeting, the, precise, location, of, the, tent, is, unknown, but, based, on, calculations, of, the, rate, of, movement, of, the, ice, and, the, accumulation, of, snow, it, is, believed, as, of, 2010, to, lie, between, 1, 8, and, 2, 5, km, 1, 1, and, 1, 5, miles, from, the, pole, at, a, depth, of, 17, m, 56, ft, below, the, present, surface, a, flagpole, erected, at, the, south, geographical, pole, in, december, 1965, by, the, first, argentine, overland, polar, expedition, has, been, designated, a, historic, site, or, monument, hsm, 1, following, a, proposal, by, argentina, to, the, antarctic, treaty, consultative, meeting, in, 1820, several, expeditions, claimed, to, have, been, the, first, to, have, sighted, antarctica, with, the, first, being, the, russian, expedition, led, by, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, and, mikhail, lazarev, the, first, landing, was, probably, just, over, a, year, later, when, english, born, american, captain, john, davis, a, sealer, set, foot, on, the, ice, the, basic, geography, of, the, antarctic, coastline, was, not, understood, until, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, american, naval, officer, charles, wilkes, claimed, correctly, that, antarctica, was, a, new, continent, basing, the, claim, on, his, exploration, in, 1839, 40, while, james, clark, ross, in, his, expedition, of, 1839, 1843, hoped, that, he, might, be, able, to, sail, all, the, way, to, the, south, pole, he, was, unsuccessful, british, explorer, robert, falcon, scott, on, the, discovery, expedition, of, 1901, 1904, was, the, first, to, attempt, to, find, a, route, from, the, antarctic, coastline, to, the, south, pole, scott, accompanied, by, ernest, shackleton, and, edward, wilson, set, out, with, the, aim, of, travelling, as, far, south, as, possible, and, on, 31, december, 1902, reached, 82, 16, s, shackleton, later, returned, to, antarctica, as, leader, of, the, british, antarctic, expedition, nimrod, expedition, in, a, bid, to, reach, the, pole, on, 9, january, 1909, with, three, companions, he, reached, 88, 23, s, 112, miles, 180, km, from, the, pole, before, being, forced, to, turn, back, the, first, men, to, reach, the, geographic, south, pole, were, the, norwegian, roald, amundsen, and, his, party, on, 14, december, 1911, amundsen, named, his, camp, polheim, and, the, entire, plateau, surrounding, the, pole, king, haakon, vii, vidde, in, honour, of, king, haakon, vii, of, norway, robert, falcon, scott, returned, to, antarctica, with, his, second, expedition, the, terra, nova, expedition, initially, unaware, of, amundsen, s, secretive, expedition, scott, and, four, other, men, reached, the, south, pole, on, 17, january, 1912, thirty, four, days, after, amundsen, on, the, return, trip, scott, and, his, four, companions, all, died, of, starvation, and, extreme, cold, in, 1914, ernest, shackleton, s, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, set, out, with, the, goal, of, crossing, antarctica, via, the, south, pole, but, his, ship, the, endurance, was, frozen, in, pack, ice, and, sank, 11, months, later, the, overland, journey, was, never, made, us, admiral, richard, evelyn, byrd, with, the, assistance, of, his, first, pilot, bernt, balchen, became, the, first, person, to, fly, over, the, south, pole, on, 29, november, 1929, it, was, not, until, 31, october, 1956, that, humans, once, again, set, foot, at, the, south, pole, when, a, party, led, by, admiral, george, j, dufek, of, the, us, navy, landed, there, in, an, r4d, 5l, skytrain, c, 47, skytrain, aircraft, the, us, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, was, established, by, air, over, 1956, 1957, for, the, international, geophysical, year, and, has, been, continuously, staffed, since, then, by, research, and, support, personnel, after, amundsen, and, scott, the, next, people, to, reach, the, south, pole, overland, albeit, with, some, air, support, were, edmund, hillary, 4, january, 1958, and, vivian, fuchs, 19, january, 1958, and, their, respective, parties, during, the, commonwealth, trans, antarctic, expedition, there, have, been, many, subsequent, expeditions, to, arrive, at, the, south, pole, by, surface, transportation, including, those, by, havola, crary, and, fiennes, the, first, group, of, women, to, reach, the, pole, were, pam, young, jean, pearson, lois, jones, eileen, mcsaveney, kay, lindsay, and, terry, tickhill, in, 1969, in, 1978, 79, michele, eileen, raney, became, the, first, woman, to, winter, at, the, south, pole, subsequent, to, the, establishment, in, 1987, of, the, logistic, support, base, at, patriot, hills, base, camp, the, south, pole, became, more, accessible, to, non, government, expeditions, on, 30, december, 1989, arved, fuchs, and, reinhold, messner, were, the, first, to, traverse, antarctica, via, the, south, pole, without, animal, or, motorized, help, using, only, skis, and, the, help, of, wind, two, women, victoria, e, murden, and, shirley, metz, reached, the, pole, by, land, on, 17, january, 1989, the, fastest, unsupported, journey, to, the, geographic, south, pole, from, the, ocean, is, 24, days, and, one, hour, from, hercules, inlet, and, was, set, in, 2011, by, norwegian, adventurer, christian, eide, who, beat, the, previous, solo, record, set, in, 2009, by, american, todd, carmichael, of, 39, days, and, seven, hours, and, the, previous, group, record, also, set, in, 2009, of, 33, days, and, 23, hours, the, fastest, solo, unsupported, and, unassisted, trek, to, the, south, pole, by, a, female, was, performed, by, hannah, mckeand, from, the, uk, in, 2006, she, made, the, journey, in, 39, days, 9, hours, 33, minutes, she, started, on, 19, november, 2006, and, finished, on, 28, december, 2006, in, the, 2011, 12, summer, separate, expeditions, by, norwegian, aleksander, gamme, and, australians, james, castrission, and, justin, jones, jointly, claimed, the, first, unsupported, trek, without, dogs, or, kites, from, the, antarctic, coast, to, the, south, pole, and, back, the, two, expeditions, started, from, hercules, inlet, a, day, apart, with, gamme, starting, first, but, completing, according, to, plan, the, last, few, kilometers, together, as, gamme, traveled, alone, he, thus, simultaneously, became, the, first, to, complete, the, task, solo, on, 28, december, 2018, captain, lou, rudd, became, the, first, briton, to, cross, the, antarctic, unassisted, via, the, south, pole, and, the, second, person, to, make, the, journey, in, 56, days, on, 10, january, 2020, mollie, hughes, became, the, youngest, person, to, ski, to, the, pole, aged, 29, during, winter, may, through, august, the, south, pole, receives, no, sunlight, at, all, and, is, completely, dark, apart, from, moonlight, in, summer, november, through, february, the, sun, is, continuously, above, the, horizon, and, appears, to, move, in, a, counter, clockwise, circle, however, it, is, always, low, in, the, sky, reaching, a, maximum, of, approximately, 23, 5, around, the, december, solstice, because, of, the, approximately, 23, 5, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, much, of, the, sunlight, that, does, reach, the, surface, is, reflected, by, the, white, snow, this, lack, of, warmth, from, the, sun, combined, with, the, high, altitude, about, 2, 800, metres, 9, 200, ft, means, that, the, south, pole, has, one, of, the, coldest, climates, on, earth, though, it, is, not, quite, the, coldest, that, record, goes, to, the, region, in, the, vicinity, of, the, vostok, station, also, in, antarctica, which, lies, at, a, higher, elevation, the, south, pole, is, at, an, altitude, of, 9, 200, feet, 2, 800, m, but, feels, like, 11, 000, feet, 3, 400, m, centripetal, force, from, the, spin, of, the, planet, throws, the, atmosphere, toward, the, equator, the, south, pole, is, colder, than, the, north, pole, primarily, because, of, the, elevation, difference, and, for, being, in, the, middle, of, a, continent, the, north, pole, is, a, few, feet, from, sea, level, in, the, middle, of, an, ocean, in, midsummer, as, the, sun, reaches, its, maximum, elevation, of, about, 23, 5, degrees, high, temperatures, at, the, south, pole, in, january, average, at, 25, 9, c, 15, f, as, the, six, month, day, wears, on, and, the, sun, gets, lower, temperatures, drop, as, well, they, reach, 55, c, 67, f, around, sunset, late, march, and, sunrise, late, september, in, midwinter, the, average, temperature, remains, steady, at, around, 60, c, 76, f, the, highest, temperature, ever, recorded, at, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, was, 12, 3, c, 9, 9, f, on, christmas, day, 2011, and, the, lowest, was, 82, 8, c, 117, 0, f, on, 23, june, 1982, for, comparison, the, lowest, temperature, directly, recorded, anywhere, on, earth, was, 89, 2, c, 128, 6, f, at, vostok, station, on, 21, july, 1983, though, 93, 2, c, 135, 8, f, was, measured, indirectly, by, satellite, in, east, antarctica, between, dome, a, and, dome, f, in, august, 2010, mean, annual, temperature, at, the, south, pole, is, 49, 5, c, 57, 1, f, the, south, pole, has, an, ice, cap, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, ef, it, resembles, a, desert, receiving, very, little, precipitation, air, humidity, is, near, zero, however, high, winds, can, cause, the, blowing, of, snowfall, and, the, accumulation, of, snow, amounts, to, about, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, per, year, the, former, dome, seen, in, pictures, of, the, amundsen, scott, station, is, partially, buried, due, to, snow, storms, and, the, entrance, to, the, dome, had, to, be, regularly, bulldozed, to, uncover, it, more, recent, buildings, are, raised, on, stilts, so, that, the, snow, does, not, build, up, against, their, sides, in, most, places, on, earth, local, time, is, determined, by, longitude, such, that, the, time, of, day, is, more, or, less, synchronised, to, the, perceived, position, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, for, example, at, midday, the, sun, is, roughly, perceived, to, be, at, its, highest, this, line, of, reasoning, fails, at, the, south, pole, where, the, sun, is, seen, to, rise, and, set, only, once, per, year, with, solar, elevation, varying, only, with, day, of, the, year, not, time, of, day, there, is, no, a, priori, reason, for, placing, the, south, pole, in, any, particular, time, zone, but, as, a, matter, of, practical, convenience, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, keeps, new, zealand, time, utc, 12, utc, 13, this, is, because, the, us, flies, its, resupply, missions, operation, deep, freeze, out, of, mcmurdo, station, which, is, supplied, from, christchurch, new, zealand, due, to, its, exceptionally, harsh, climate, there, are, no, native, resident, plants, or, animals, at, the, south, pole, off, course, south, polar, skuas, and, snow, petrels, are, occasionally, seen, there, in, 2000, it, was, reported, that, microbes, had, been, detected, living, in, the, south, pole, ice, scientists, published, in, the, journal, gondwana, research, that, evidence, had, been, found, of, dinosaurs, with, feathers, to, protect, the, animals, from, the, extreme, cold, the, fossils, had, been, found, over, 100, years, ago, in, koonwarra, australia, but, in, sediment, which, had, accumulated, under, a, lake, which, had, been, near, to, the, south, pole, millions, of, years, ago
