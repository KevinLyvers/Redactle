lake, ladoga, l, d, russian, romanized, ladozhskoye, ozero, ipa, or, ipa, finnish, laatokka, livvi, luadogu, veps, ladog, ladoganj, rv, is, a, freshwater, lake, located, in, the, republic, of, karelia, and, leningrad, oblast, in, northwestern, russia, in, the, vicinity, of, saint, petersburg, it, is, the, largest, lake, located, entirely, in, europe, the, second, largest, lake, in, russia, after, baikal, and, the, 14th, largest, freshwater, lake, by, area, in, the, world, it, is, comparable, in, size, to, lake, ontario, ladoga, lacus, a, methane, lake, on, saturn, s, moon, titan, is, named, after, the, lake, in, one, of, nestor, s, chronicles, from, the, 12th, century, a, lake, called, the, great, nevo, is, mentioned, a, clear, link, to, the, neva, river, and, possibly, further, to, finnish, nevo, sea, or, neva, bog, quagmire, ancient, norse, sagas, and, hanseatic, treaties, both, mention, a, city, made, of, lakes, named, old, norse, aldeigja, or, aldoga, since, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, this, hydronym, was, commonly, known, as, ladoga, according, to, t, n, jackson, it, can, be, taken, almost, for, granted, that, the, name, of, ladoga, first, referred, to, the, river, then, the, city, and, only, then, the, lake, therefore, he, considers, the, primary, hydronym, ladoga, to, originate, in, the, eponymous, inflow, to, the, lower, reaches, of, the, volkhov, river, whose, early, finnic, name, was, alodejoki, corresponding, to, modern, finnish, alojen, joki, river, of, the, lowlands, the, germanic, toponym, aldeigja, aldoga, was, soon, borrowed, by, the, slavic, population, and, transformed, by, means, of, the, old, east, slavic, metathesis, ald, lad, to, old, east, slavic, the, old, norse, intermediary, word, between, finnish, and, old, east, slavic, word, is, fully, supported, by, archeology, since, the, scandinavians, first, appeared, in, ladoga, in, the, early, 750s, that, is, a, couple, of, decades, before, the, slavs, other, hypotheses, about, the, origin, of, the, name, derive, it, from, karelian, aalto, wave, and, karelian, aaltokas, wavy, or, from, the, russian, dialectal, word, meaning, open, lake, extensive, water, field, eugene, helimski, by, contrast, offers, an, etymology, rooted, in, german, in, his, opinion, the, primary, name, of, the, lake, was, old, norse, aldauga, old, source, associated, to, the, open, sea, in, contrast, to, the, name, of, the, neva, river, flowing, from, lake, ladoga, which, would, derive, from, the, german, expression, for, the, new, through, the, intermediate, form, aldaugja, old, norse, aldeigja, came, about, referring, to, the, city, of, ladoga, the, lake, has, an, average, surface, area, of, 17, 891, km, 2, excluding, the, islands, slightly, larger, than, kuwait, its, north, to, south, length, is, 219, km, and, its, average, width, is, 83, km, the, average, depth, is, 47, m, although, it, reaches, a, maximum, of, 230, m, in, the, north, western, part, basin, area, 276, 000, km, 2, volume, 837, km, 3, earlier, estimated, as, 908, km, 3, there, are, around, 660, islands, with, a, total, area, of, about, 435, km, 2, ladoga, is, on, average, 5, m, above, sea, level, most, of, the, islands, including, the, famous, valaam, archipelago, kilpola, and, konevets, are, situated, in, the, northwest, of, the, lake, separated, from, the, baltic, sea, by, the, karelian, isthmus, it, drains, into, the, gulf, of, finland, via, the, neva, river, lake, ladoga, is, navigable, being, a, part, of, the, volga, baltic, waterway, connecting, the, baltic, sea, with, the, volga, river, the, ladoga, canal, bypasses, the, lake, in, the, south, connecting, the, neva, to, the, svir, the, basin, of, lake, ladoga, includes, about, 50, 000, lakes, and, 3, 500, rivers, longer, than, 10, km, about, 85, of, the, water, inflow, is, due, to, tributaries, 13, is, due, to, precipitation, and, 2, is, due, to, underground, waters, geologically, the, lake, ladoga, depression, is, a, graben, and, syncline, structure, of, proterozoic, age, precambrian, this, ladoga, pasha, structure, as, it, is, known, hosts, jotnian, sediments, during, the, pleistocene, glaciations, the, depression, was, partially, stripped, of, its, sedimentary, rock, fill, by, glacial, overdeepening, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, about, 17, 000, years, bp, the, lake, served, likely, as, a, channel, that, concentrated, ice, of, the, fennoscandian, ice, sheet, into, an, ice, stream, that, fed, glacier, lobes, further, east, deglaciation, following, the, weichselian, glaciation, took, place, in, the, lake, ladoga, basin, between, 12, 500, and, 11, 500, radiocarbon, years, bp, lake, ladoga, was, initially, part, of, the, baltic, ice, lake, 70, 80, m, above, present, sea, level, a, historical, freshwater, stage, of, baltic, sea, it, is, possible, though, not, certain, that, ladoga, was, isolated, from, it, during, regression, of, the, subsequent, yoldia, sea, brackish, stage, 10, 200, 9, 500, bp, the, isolation, threshold, should, be, at, heinjoki, to, the, east, of, vyborg, where, the, baltic, sea, and, ladoga, were, connected, by, a, strait, or, a, river, outlet, at, least, until, the, formation, of, the, river, neva, and, possibly, even, much, later, until, the, 12th, century, ad, or, so, at, 9, 500, bp, lake, onega, previously, draining, into, the, white, sea, started, emptying, into, ladoga, via, the, river, svir, between, 9, 500, and, 9, 100, bp, during, the, transgression, of, ancylus, lake, the, next, freshwater, stage, of, the, baltic, ladoga, certainly, became, part, of, it, even, if, they, hadn, t, been, connected, immediately, before, during, the, ancylus, lake, subsequent, regression, around, 8, 800, bp, ladoga, became, isolated, ladoga, slowly, transgressed, in, its, southern, part, due, to, uplift, of, the, baltic, shield, in, the, north, it, has, been, hypothesized, but, not, proven, that, waters, of, the, litorina, sea, the, next, brackish, water, stage, of, the, baltic, occasionally, invaded, ladoga, between, 7, 000, and, 5, 000, bp, around, 5, 000, bp, the, waters, of, the, saimaa, lake, penetrated, salpausselk, and, formed, a, new, outlet, river, vuoksi, entering, lake, ladoga, in, the, northwestern, corner, and, raising, its, level, by, 1, 2, m, the, river, neva, originated, when, the, ladoga, waters, at, last, broke, through, the, threshold, at, porogi, into, the, lower, portions, of, izhora, river, then, a, tributary, of, the, gulf, of, finland, between, 4, 000, and, 2, 000, bp, dating, of, some, sediments, in, the, northwestern, part, of, lake, ladoga, suggests, it, happened, at, 3, 100, radiocarbon, years, bp, 3, 410, 3, 250, calendar, years, bp, the, ladoga, is, rich, with, fish, 48, forms, species, and, infra, specific, taxa, of, fish, have, been, encountered, in, the, lake, including, roach, carp, bream, zander, european, perch, ruffe, endemic, variety, of, smelt, two, varieties, of, coregonus, albula, vendace, eight, varieties, of, coregonus, lavaretus, a, number, of, other, salmonidae, as, well, as, albeit, rarely, endangered, atlantic, sturgeon, formerly, confused, with, european, sea, sturgeon, commercial, fishing, was, once, a, major, industry, but, has, been, hurt, by, overfishing, after, the, war, between, 1945, and, 1954, the, total, annual, catch, increased, and, reached, a, maximum, of, 4, 900, tonnes, however, unbalanced, fishery, led, to, the, drastic, decrease, of, catch, in, 1955, 1963, sometimes, to, 1, 600, tonnes, per, year, trawling, has, been, forbidden, in, lake, ladoga, since, 1956, and, some, other, restrictions, were, imposed, the, situation, gradually, recovered, and, in, 1971, 1990, the, catch, ranged, between, 4, 900, and, 6, 900, tonnes, per, year, about, the, same, level, as, the, total, catch, in, 1938, fish, farms, and, recreational, fishing, are, developing, it, has, its, own, endemic, ringed, seal,
