later, sources, are, often, of, dubious, reliability, what, is, certain, is, that, the, hague, was, founded, by, the, last, counts, of, the, house, of, holland, floris, iv, already, owned, two, residences, in, the, area, but, presumably, purchased, a, third, court, situated, by, the, present, day, hofvijver, in, 1229, previously, owned, by, a, woman, called, meilendis, presumably, floris, iv, intended, to, rebuild, the, court, into, a, large, castle, but, he, died, in, a, tournament, in, 1234, before, anything, was, built, his, son, and, successor, william, ii, lived, in, the, court, and, after, he, was, elected, king, of, the, romans, in, 1248, he, promptly, returned, to, the, hague, and, had, builders, turn, the, court, into, a, royal, palace, regale, palacium, which, would, later, be, called, the, binnenhof, inner, court, he, died, in, 1256, before, this, palace, was, completed, but, parts, of, it, were, finished, during, the, reign, of, his, son, floris, v, of, which, the, ridderzaal, knights, hall, still, intact, is, the, most, prominent, it, is, still, used, for, political, events, such, as, the, annual, speech, from, the, throne, by, the, dutch, monarch, from, the, 13th, century, onward, the, counts, of, holland, used, the, hague, as, their, administrative, center, and, residence, when, in, holland, the, village, that, originated, around, the, binnenhof, was, first, mentioned, as, die, haghe, in, a, charter, dating, from, 1242, it, became, the, primary, residence, of, the, counts, of, holland, in, 1358, and, thus, became, the, seat, of, many, government, institutions, this, status, allowed, the, village, to, grow, by, the, late, middle, ages, it, had, grown, to, the, size, of, a, city, although, it, did, not, receive, city, rights, in, its, early, years, the, village, was, in, the, ambacht, or, rural, district, of, monster, which, was, governed, by, the, lord, of, monster, seeking, to, exercise, more, direct, control, over, the, village, however, the, count, split, the, village, off, and, created, a, separate, ambacht, called, haagambacht, governed, directly, by, the, counts, of, holland, the, territory, of, haagambacht, was, considerably, expanded, during, the, reign, of, floris, v, when, the, house, of, burgundy, inherited, the, counties, of, holland, and, zeeland, in, 1432, they, appointed, a, stadtholder, to, rule, in, their, stead, with, the, states, of, holland, and, west, friesland, as, an, advisory, council, although, their, seat, was, in, the, hague, the, city, became, subordinate, to, more, important, centres, of, government, such, as, brussels, and, mechelen, from, where, the, sovereigns, ruled, over, the, increasingly, centralised, burgundian, netherlands, at, the, beginning, of, the, eighty, years, war, the, absence, of, city, walls, proved, disastrous, as, it, allowed, spanish, troops, to, easily, occupy, the, town, in, 1575, the, states, of, holland, temporarily, based, in, delft, even, considered, demolishing, the, city, but, this, proposal, was, abandoned, after, mediation, by, william, the, silent, in, 1588, the, hague, became, the, permanent, seat, of, the, states, of, holland, as, well, as, the, states, general, of, the, dutch, republic, for, the, administration, to, maintain, control, over, city, matters, the, hague, never, received, official, city, status, although, it, did, have, many, of, the, privileges, normally, granted, only, to, cities, in, modern, administrative, law, city, rights, have, no, place, anymore, in, 1806, when, the, kingdom, of, holland, was, a, puppet, state, of, the, first, french, empire, the, settlement, was, granted, city, rights, by, louis, bonaparte, after, the, napoleonic, wars, modern, day, belgium, and, the, netherlands, were, combined, in, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, to, form, a, buffer, against, france, as, a, compromise, brussels, and, amsterdam, alternated, as, capital, every, two, years, with, the, government, remaining, in, the, hague, after, the, separation, of, belgium, in, 1830, amsterdam, remained, the, capital, of, the, netherlands, while, the, government, was, situated, in, the, hague, when, the, government, started, to, play, a, more, prominent, role, in, dutch, society, after, 1850, the, hague, quickly, expanded, many, streets, were, specifically, built, for, the, large, number, of, civil, servants, employed, in, the, country, s, government, and, for, the, dutchmen, who, were, retiring, from, the, administration, of, the, netherlands, east, indies, the, growing, city, amalgamated, the, rural, municipality, of, loosduinen, partly, in, 1903, and, completely, in, 1923, the, city, sustained, heavy, damage, during, world, war, ii, many, jews, were, killed, during, the, german, occupation, additionally, the, atlantic, wall, was, built, through, the, city, causing, a, large, quarter, to, be, torn, down, by, the, nazi, occupants, on, 3, march, 1945, the, royal, air, force, mistakenly, bombed, the, bezuidenhout, quarter, the, target, was, an, installation, of, v, 2, rockets, in, the, nearby, haagse, bos, park, but, because, of, navigational, errors, the, bombs, fell, on, a, heavily, populated, and, historic, part, of, the, city, the, bombardment, wreaked, widespread, destruction, in, the, area, and, caused, 511, fatalities, because, of, uncertainty, about, what, to, do, after, the, destructions, of, the, bombing, nobody, attempted, to, plan, a, reconstruction, of, bezuidenhout, in, 1962, david, jokinen, saw, an, opportunity, to, put, an, end, to, the, situation, where, two, main, stations, each, served, only, part, of, the, rail, traffic, the, jokinen, plan, included, the, intent, to, demolish, the, staatsspoor, station, entirely, with, hollands, spoor, becoming, the, central, station, jokinen, s, plan, sparked, fierce, discussions, the, plan, was, not, implemented, in, part, because, it, was, only, presented, when, decision, making, had, finally, reached, an, advanced, stage, in, the, site, of, the, staatsspoor, station, now, stands, the, den, haag, centraal, railway, station, after, the, war, the, hague, became, at, one, time, the, largest, building, site, in, europe, the, city, expanded, massively, to, the, southwest, and, the, destroyed, areas, were, quickly, rebuilt, the, population, peaked, at, 600, 000, inhabitants, around, 1965, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, mostly, white, middle, class, families, moved, to, neighbouring, towns, such, as, voorburg, leidschendam, rijswijk, and, most, of, all, zoetermeer, this, led, to, the, traditional, pattern, of, an, impoverished, inner, city, and, more, prosperous, suburbs, attempts, to, include, parts, of, these, municipalities, in, the, city, of, the, hague, were, highly, controversial, in, the, 1990s, with, the, consent, of, the, dutch, parliament, the, hague, annexed, fairly, large, areas, from, neighbouring, towns, as, well, as, from, not, even, bordering, ones, on, which, the, complete, new, residential, areas, were, built, and, are, still, being, built, the, hague, is, the, largest, dutch, city, on, the, north, sea, in, the, netherlands, and, forms, the, centre, of, the, greater, the, hague, urban, area, westland, and, wateringen, lie, to, the, south, rijswijk, delft, and, the, rotterdam, conurbation, known, as, rijnmond, to, the, southeast, pijnacker, nootdorp, and, zoetermeer, to, the, east, leidschendam, voorburg, voorschoten, and, the, leiden, conurbation, to, the, northeast, and, wassenaar, to, the, north, the, conurbations, around, the, hague, and, rotterdam, are, close, enough, to, be, seen, as, a, single, conurbation, in, some, contexts, for, example, they, share, the, rotterdam, the, hague, airport, and, a, light, rail, system, called, randstadrail, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, rotterdam, the, hague, metropolitan, area, this, large, conurbation, centred, on, the, hague, and, rotterdam, is, in, turn, part, of, the, randstad, specifically, a, band, of, municipalities, called, the, south, wing, zuidvleugel, the, randstad, which, also, includes, among, others, amsterdam, and, utrecht, has, a, population, of, 6, 659, 300, the, hague, lies, at, the, southwestern, corner, of, the, second, largest, conurbation, in, the, european, union, the, hague, is, divided, into, eight, official, districts, which, are, in, turn, divided, into, neighbourhoods, some, of, the, most, prosperous, and, some, of, the, poorest, neighbourhoods, of, the, netherlands, can, be, found, in, the, hague, the, wealthier, areas, such, as, statenkwartier, belgisch, park, marlot, benoordenhout, and, archipelbuurt, are, generally, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, city, closer, to, the, sea, whereas, the, southeastern, neighbourhoods, such, as, transvaal, moerwijk, and, the, schilderswijk, are, significantly, poorer, except, the, vinex, locations, of, leidschenveen, ypenburg, and, wateringse, veld, this, division, is, reflected, in, the, local, accent, the, more, affluent, citizens, are, usually, called, hagenaars, and, speak, so, called, bekakt, haags, posh, this, contrasts, with, the, hagenezen, who, speak, plat, haags, vulgar, see, demographics, below, the, districts, are, the, hague, experiences, a, temperate, oceanic, climate, k, ppen, cfb, similar, to, almost, all, of, the, netherlands, because, of, its, location, on, the, coast, it, experiences, milder, winters, and, cooler, summers, than, more, inland, locations, however, because, of, its, location, it, can, also, be, extremely, windy, in, the, winter, and, humid, in, the, summer, it, also, gets, more, sunshine, city, life, concentrates, around, the, hofvijver, and, the, binnenhof, where, the, states, general, of, the, netherlands, is, located, because, of, its, history, the, historical, inner, city, of, the, hague, differs, in, various, aspects, from, the, nearby, smaller, cities, of, leiden, and, delft, it, does, not, have, a, cramped, inner, city, bordered, by, canals, and, walls, instead, it, has, some, small, streets, in, the, town, centre, that, may, be, dated, from, the, late, middle, ages, and, several, spacious, streets, boasting, large, and, luxurious, 18th, century, residences, built, for, diplomats, and, affluent, dutch, families, it, has, a, large, church, dating, from, the, 15th, century, a, city, hall,
