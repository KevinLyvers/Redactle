of, the, pirates, in, 1660, the, population, of, jamaica, was, about, 4, 500, white, and, 1, 500, black, by, the, early, 1670s, as, the, english, developed, sugar, cane, plantations, worked, by,

migration, of, large, numbers, of, irish, to, the, island, continued, into, the, 18th, century, a, limited, form, of, local, government, was, introduced, with, the, creation, of, the, house, of, assembly, of, jamaica, in, 1664, however, it, represented, only, a, tiny, number, of, rich, plantation, owners, in, 1692, the, colony, was, rocked, by, an, earthquake, that, resulted, in, several, thousand, deaths, and, the, almost, complete, destruction, of, port, royal, during, the, 1700s, the, economy, boomed, based, largely, on, sugar, and, other, crops, for, export, such, as, coffee,

18th, century, slaves, ran, away, and, joined, the, maroons, in, increasing, numbers, and, resulted, in, the, first, maroon, war, 1728, 1739, 40, which, ended, in, stalemate, the, british, government, sued, for, peace, and, signed, treaties, with, the, leeward, maroons, led, by, cudjoe, and, accompong, in, 1739, and, the, windward, maroons, led, by, quao, and, queen, nanny, in, 1740, a, large, slave, rebellion, known, as, tacky, s, war, broke, out, in, 1760, but, was, defeated, by, the, british, and, their, maroon, allies, after, the, second, conflict, in, 1795, 96, many, maroons, from, the, maroon, town, of, cudjoe, s, town, trelawny, town, were, expelled, to, nova, scotia, and, later, sierra, leone, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, jamaica, s, dependence, on, slave, labour, and, a, plantation, economy, had, resulted, in, black, people, outnumbering, white, people, by, a, ratio, of, almost, 20, to, 1, although, the, british, had, outlawed, the, importation, of, slaves, some, were, still, smuggled, in, from, spanish, colonies, and, directly, from, africa, while, planning, the, abolition, of, slavery, the, british, parliament, passed, laws, to, improve, conditions, for, slaves, they, banned, the, use, of, whips, in, the, field, and, flogging, of, women, informed, planters, that, slaves, were, to, be, allowed, religious, instruction, and, required, a, free, day, during, each, week, when, slaves, could, sell, their, produce, prohibiting, sunday, markets, to, enable, slaves, to, attend, church, the, house, of, assembly, in, jamaica, resented, and, resisted, the, new, laws, members, with, membership, then, restricted, to, european, descended, jamaicans, claimed, that, the, slaves, were, content, and, objected, to, parliament, s, interference, in, island, affairs, slave, owners, feared, possible, revolts, if, conditions, were, lightened, the, british, abolished, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, but, not, the, institution, itself, in, 1831, a, huge, slave, rebellion, known, as, the, baptist, war, broke, out, led, by, the, baptist, preacher, samuel, sharpe, the, rebellion, resulted, in, hundreds, of, deaths, and, the, destruction, of, many, plantations, and, led, to, ferocious, reprisals, by, the, plantocracy, class, as, a, result, of, rebellions, such, as, these, as, well, as, the, efforts, of, abolitionists, britain, outlawed, slavery, in, its, empire, in, 1834, with, full, emancipation, from, chattel, slavery, declared, in, 1838, the, population, in, 1834, was, 371, 070, of, whom, 15, 000, were, white, 5, 000, free, black, 40, 000, coloured, or, free, people, of, colour, mixed, race, and, 311, 070, were, slaves, the, resulting, labour, shortage, prompted, the, british, to, begin, to, import, indentured, servants, to, supplement, the, labour, pool, as, many, freedmen, resisted, working, on, the, plantations, workers, recruited, from, india, began, arriving, in, 1845, chinese, workers, in, 1854, many, jamaicans, are, descendants, of, south, asian, and, chinese, people, over, the, next, 20, years, several, epidemics, of, cholera, scarlet, fever, and, smallpox, hit, the, island, killing, almost, 60, 000, people, about, 10, per, day, nevertheless, in, 1871, the, census, recorded, a, population, of, 506, 154, people, 246, 573, of, whom, were, males, and, 259, 581, females, their, races, were, recorded, as, 13, 101, white, 100, 346, coloured, known, as, the, browning, class, and, 392, 707, black, there, was, an, economic, slump, in, this, period, with, many, jamaicans, living, in, poverty, dissatisfaction, with, this, and, continued, racial, discrimination, and, marginalisation, of, the, black, majority, led, to, the, outbreak, of, the, morant, bay, rebellion, in, 1865, led, by, paul, bogle, which, was, put, down, by, governor, john, eyre, with, such, brutality, that, he, was, recalled, from, his, position, his, successor, john, peter, grant, enacted, a, series, of, social, financial, and, political,

1907, jamaica, was, struck, by, an, earthquake, which, together, with, the, subsequent, fire, resulted, in, considerable, destruction, in, kingston, and, caused, the, deaths, of, between, 800, and, 1, 000, people, unemployment, and, poverty, remained, a, problem, for, many, jamaicans, various, movements, seeking, political, change, arose, as, a, result, most, notably, the, universal, negro, improvement, association, and, african, communities, league, founded, by, marcus, garvey, in, 1917, as, well, as, seeking, greater, political, rights, and, an, improvement, for, the, condition, of, workers, garvey, was, also, a, prominent, pan, africanist, and, proponent, of, the, back, to, africa, movement, he, was, also, one, of, the, chief, inspirations, behind, rastafari, a, religion, founded, in, jamaica, in, the, 1930s, that, combined, christianity, with, an, afrocentric, theology, focused, on, the, figure, of, haile, selassie, emperor, of, ethiopia, despite, occasional, persecution, rastafari, grew, to, become, an, established, faith, on, the, island, later, spreading, abroad, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, hit, jamaica, hard, as, part, of, the, british, west, indian, labour, unrest, of, 1934, 39, jamaica, saw, numerous, strikes, culminating, in, a, strike, in, 1938, that, turned, into, a, riot, as, a, result, the, british, government, instituted, a, commission, to, look, into, the, causes, of, the, disturbances, their, report, recommended, political, and, economic, reforms, in, britain, s, caribbean, colonies, a, new, house, of, representatives, was, established, in, 1944, elected, by, universal, adult, suffrage, during, this, period, jamaica, s, two, party, system, emerged, with, the, creation, of, the, jamaican, labour, party, jlp, under, alexander, bustamante, and, the, people, s, national, party, pnp, under, norman, manley, jamaica, slowly, gained, increasing, autonomy, from, the, united, kingdom, in, 1958, it, became, a, province, in, the, federation, of, the, west, indies, a, federation, of, several, of, britain, s, caribbean, colonies, membership, of, the, federation, proved, to, be, divisive, however, and, a, referendum, on, the, issue, saw, a, slight, majority, voting, to, leave, after, leaving, the, federation, jamaica, attained, full, independence, on, 6, august, 1962, the, new, state, retained, however, its, membership, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, with, the, british, monarch, as, head, of, state, and, adopted, a, westminster, style, parliamentary, system, bustamante, at, the, age, of, 78, became, the, country, s, first, prime, minister, strong, economic, growth, averaging, approximately, 6, per, year, marked, the, first, ten, years, of, independence, under, conservative, jlp, governments, these, were, led, by, successive, prime, ministers, alexander, bustamante, donald, sangster, who, died, of, natural, causes, within, two, months, of, taking, office, and, hugh, shearer, the, growth, was, fuelled, by, high, levels, of, private, investment, in, bauxite, alumina, tourism, the, manufacturing, industry, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, agricultural, sector, in, the, 1967, jamaican, general, election, the, jlp, were, victorious, again, winning, 33, out, of, 53, seats, with, the, pnp, taking, 20, seats, in, terms, of, foreign, policy, jamaica, became, a, member, of, the, non, aligned, movement, seeking, to, retain, strong, ties, with, britain, and, the, united, states, whilst, also, developing, links, with, communist, states, such, as, cuba, the, optimism, of, the, first, decade, was, accompanied, by, a, growing, sense, of, inequality, among, many, afro, jamaicans, and, a, concern, that, the, benefits, of, growth, were, not, being, shared, by, the, urban, poor, many, of, whom, ended, up, living, in, crime, ridden, shanty, towns, in, kingston, this, led, to, the, voters, electing, the, pnp, under, michael, manley, in, 1972, the, pnp, won, 37, seats, to, the, jlp, s, 16, manley, s, government, enacted, various, social, reforms, such, as, a, higher, minimum, wage, land, reform, legislation, for, women, s, equality, greater, housing, construction, and, an,

another, landslide, winning, 47, seats, to, the, jlp, s, 13, the, turnout, was, a, very, high, 85, percent, however, the, economy, faltered, in, this, period, due, to, a, combination, of, internal, and, external, factors, such, as, the, oil, shocks, the, rivalry, between, the, jlp, and, pnp, became, intense, and, political, and, gang, related, violence, grew, significantly, in, this, period, by, 1980, jamaica, s, gross, national, product, had, declined, to, some, 25, below, its, 1972, level, seeking, change, jamaicans, voted, the, jlp, back, in, in, 1980, under, edward, seaga, the, jlp,

a, significant, reduction, in, production, by, the, second, largest, producer, alcan, reynolds, jamaica, mines, ltd, left, the, jamaican, industry, there, was, also, a, decline, in, tourism, which, was, important, to, the, economy, owing, to, rising, foreign, and, local, debt, accompanied, by, large, fiscal, deficits, the, government, sought, international, monetary, fund, imf, financing, which, was, dependent, on, implementing, various, austerity, measures, these, resulted, in, strikes, in, 1985, and, a, decline, in, support, for, the, seaga, government, exacerbated, by, criticism, of, the, government, s, response, to, the, devastation, caused, by, hurricane, gilbert, in, 1988, having, now, de, emphasised, socialism, and, adopting, a, more, centrist, position, michael, manley, and, the,

dominated, by, the, effects, of, the, global, recession, as, well, as, the, fallout, from, an, attempt, by, jamaican, police, and, military, to, arrest, drug, lord, christopher, coke, in, 2010, which, erupted, in, violence, resulting, in, over, 70, deaths, as, a, result, of, this, incident, golding, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, andrew, holness, in, 2011, independence, however, widely, celebrated, in, jamaica, has, been, questioned, in, the, early, 21st, century, in, 2011, a, survey, showed, that, approximately, 60, of, jamaicans, believe, that, the, country, would, have, been, better, off, had, it, remained, a, british, colony, with, only, 17, believing, it, would, have, been, worse, off, citing, as, problems, years, of, social, and, fiscal, mismanagement, in, the, country,

including, 35, indigenous, species, and, 22, subspecies, it, is, also, the, native, home, to, the, jamaican, swallowtail, the, western, hemisphere, s, largest, butterfly, coral, reef, ecosystems, are, important, because, they, provide, people, with, a, source, of, livelihood, food, recreation, and, medicinal, compounds, and, protect, the, land, on, which, they, live, jamaica, relies, on, the, ocean, and, its, ecosystem, for, its, development, however, the, marine, life, in, jamaica, is, also, being, affected, there, could, be, many, factors, that, contribute, to, marine, life, not, having, the, best, health, jamaica, s, geological, origin, topographical, features, and, seasonal, high, rainfall, make, it, susceptible, to, a, range, of, natural, hazards, that, can, affect, the, coastal, and, oceanic, environments, these, include, storm, surge, slope, failures, landslides, earthquakes, floods, and, hurricanes, coral, reefs, in, the, negril, marine, park, nmp, jamaica, have, been, increasingly, impacted, by, nutrient, pollution, and, macroalgal, blooms, following, decades, of, intensive, development, as, a, major, tourist, destination, another, one, of, those, factors, could, include, tourism, being, that, jamaica, is, a, very, touristy, place, the, island, draws, numerous, people, travelling, here, from, all, over, the, world, the, jamaican, tourism, industry, accounts, for, 32, of, total, employment, and, 36, of, the, country, s, gdp, and, is, largely, based, on, the, sun, sea, and, sand, the, last, two, of, these, attributes, being, dependent, on, healthy, coral, reef, ecosystems, because, of, jamaica, s, tourism, they, have, developed, a, study, to, see, if, the, tourist, would, be, willing, to, help, financially, to, manage, their, marine, ecosystem, because, jamaica, alone, is, unable, to, the, ocean, connects, all, the, countries, all, over, the, world, however, everyone, and, everything, is, affecting, the, flow, and, life, in, the, ocean, jamaica, is, a, very, touristy, place, specifically, because, of, their, beaches, if, their, oceans, are, not, functioning, at, their, best, then, the, well, being, of, jamaica, and, the, people, who, live, there, will, start, to, deteriorate, according, to, the, oecd, oceans, contribute, 1, 5, trillion, annually, in, value, added, to, the, overall, economy, a, developing, country, on, an, island, will, get, the, majority, of, their, revenue, from, their, ocean, pollution, comes, from, run, off, sewage, systems, and, garbage, however, this, typically, all, ends, up, in, the, ocean, after, there, is, rain, or, floods, everything, that, ends, up, in, the, water, changes, the, quality, and, balance, of, the, ocean, poor, coastal, water, quality, has, adversely, affected, fisheries, tourism, and, mariculture, as, well, as, undermining, biological, sustainability, of, the, living, resources, of, ocean, and, coastal, habitats, jamaica, imports, and, exports, many, goods, through, their, waters, some, of, the, imports, that, go, into, jamaica, include, petroleum, and, petroleum, products, issues, include, accidents, at, sea, risk, of, spills, through, local, and, international, transport, of, petroleum, and, petroleum, products, oil, spills, can, disrupt, the, marine, life, with, chemicals, that, are, not, normally, found, in, the, ocean, other, forms, of, pollution, also, occur, in, jamaica, solid, waste, disposal, mechanisms, in, jamaica, are, currently, inadequate, the, solid, waste, gets, into, the, water, through, rainfall, forces, solid, waste, is, also, harmful, to, wildlife, particularly, birds, fish, and, turtles, that, feed, at, the, surface, of, the, water, and, mistake, floating, debris, for, food, for, example, plastic, can, be, caught, around, birds, and, turtles, necks, making, it, difficult, to, eat, and, breath, as, they, begin, to, grow, causing, the, plastic, to, get, tighter, around, their, necks, pieces, of, plastic, metal, and, glass, can, be, mistaken, for, the, food, fish, eat, each, jamaican, generates, 1, kg, 2, lbs, of, waste, per, day, only, 70, of, this, is, collected, by, national, solid, waste, management, authority, nswma, the, remaining, 30, is, either, burnt, or, disposed, of, in, gullies, waterways, there, are, policies, that, are, being, put, into, place, to, help, preserve, the, ocean, and, the, life, below, water, the, goal, of, integrated, coastal, zone, management, iczm, is, to, improve, the, quality, of, life, of, human, communities, who, depend, on, coastal, resources, while, maintaining, the, biological, diversity, and, productivity, of, coastal, ecosystems, developing, an, underdeveloped, country, can, impact, the, oceans, ecosystem, because, of, all, the, construction, that, would, be, done, to, develop, the, country, over, building, driven, by, powerful, market, forces, as, well, as, poverty, among, some, sectors, of, the, population, and, destructive, exploitation, contribute, to, the, decline, of, ocean, and, coastal, resources, developing, practices, that, will, contribute, to, the, lives, of, the, people, but, also, to, the, life, of, the, ocean, and, its, ecosystem, some, of, these, practices, include, develop, sustainable, fisheries, practices, ensure, sustainable, mariculture, techniques, and, practices, sustainable, management, of, shipping, and, promote, sustainable, tourism, practices, breakdown, of, the, responses, of, the, 2011, official, census, by, the, university, of, the, west, indies, jamaica, s, diverse, ethnic, roots, are, reflected, in, the, national, motto, out, of, many, one, people, that, motto, of, out, of, many, one, people, is, disputed, by, many, on, the, island, because, jamaica, is, overwhelmingly, a, single, race, and, they, think, it, was, made, so, because, the, founding, fathers, of, jamaica, were, made, up, of, men, who, were, mostly, white, or, members, of, the, browning, or, brown, man, class, which, misrepresented, the, views, of, the, country, s, majority, black, population, most, of, the, population, of, 2, 812, 000, july, 2018, est, are, of, african, or, partially, african, descent, with, many, being, able, to, trace, their, origins, to, the, west, african, countries, of, present, day, ghana, and, nigeria, other, major, ancestral, areas, are, europe, south, asia, and, east, asia, it, is, uncommon, for, jamaicans, to, identify, themselves, by, race, as, is, prominent, in, other, countries, such, as, the, united, states, with, most, jamaicans, seeing, jamaican, nationality, as, an, identity, in, and, of, itself, identifying, as, simply, being, jamaican, regardless, of, ethnicity, a, study, found, that, the, average, admixture, on, the, island, was, 78, 3, sub, saharan, african, 16, 0, european, and, 5, 7, east, asian, a, more, precise, study, conducted, by, the, local, university, of, the, west, indies, jamaica, s, population, is, more, accurately, 76, 3, african, descent, or, black, 15, 1, afro, european, or, locally, called, the, brown, man, or, browning, class, 3, 4, east, indian, and, afro, east, indian, 3, 2, caucasian, 1, 2, chinese, and, 0, 8, other, the, jamaican, maroons, of, accompong, and, other, settlements, are, the, descendants, of, african, slaves, who, fled, the, plantations, for, the, interior, where, they, set, up, their, own, autonomous, communities, many, maroons, continue, to, have, their, own, traditions, and, speak, their, own, language, known, locally, as, kromanti, asians, form, the, third, largest, group, after, the, browning, class, i, e, descendants, of, the, mulattos, during, slavery, and, other, interracial, mixtures, subsequent, to, emancipation, and, include, indo, jamaicans, and, chinese, jamaicans, most, are, descended, from, indentured, workers, brought, by, the, british, colonial, government, to, fill, labour, shortages, following, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, 1838, along, with, their, indian, counterparts, chinese, jamaicans, have, also, played, an, integral, part, in, jamaica, s, community, and, history, there, are, about, 20, 000, jamaicans, who, have, lebanese, and, syrian, ancestry, most, were, christian, immigrants, who, fled, the, ottoman, occupation, of, lebanon, in, the, early, 19th, century, eventually, their, descendants, became, very, successful, politicians, and, businessmen, the, first, wave, of, english, immigrants, arrived, to, the, island, 1655, after, conquering, the, spanish, and, they, have, historically, been, the, dominant, group, the, first, irish, immigrants, came, to, jamaica, in, the, 1600s, as, war, prisoners, and, later, indentured, labour, the, scots, have, also, made, a, significant, impact, on, the, island, according, to, the, scotland, herald, newspaper, jamaica, has, more, people, using, the, campbell, surnames, than, the, population, of, scotland, itself, and, the, highest, percentage, of, scottish, surnames, outside, of, scotland, scottish, surnames, account, to, about, 60, of, the, surnames, in, the, jamaican, telephone, directories, the, first, jamaican, inhabitants, from, scotland, were, exiled, rebels, they, were, later, followed, by, ambitious, businessmen, who, spent, time, between, their, great, country, estates, in, scotland, and, the, island, as, a, result, many, of, the, slave, owning, plantations, on, the, island, were, owned, by, scottish, men, leading, to, a, large, number, of, mixed, race, jamaicans, with, scottish, ancestry, high, immigration, from, scotland, continued, until, well, after, independence, there, is, also, a, significant, jamaican, population, of, portuguese, descent, that, is, predominantly, of, sephardic, jewish, heritage, the, first, jews, arrived, as, explorers, from, spain, in, the, 15th, century, after, being, forced, to, choose, between, expulsion, or, conversion, to, christianity, a, small, number, of, them, became, slave, owners, or, pirates, judaism, eventually, became, very, influential, in, jamaica, and, can, be, seen, today, with, many, jewish, cemeteries, around, the, country, during, the, holocaust, jamaica, became, a, refuge, for, jews, fleeing, persecution, in, europe, by, 2015, immigration, had, increased, coming, mainly, from, china, haiti, cuba, colombia, and, latin, america, 20, 000, latin, americans, lived, in, jamaica, in, 2016, prime, minister, andrew, holness, suggested, making, spanish, jamaica, s, second, official, language, about, 7, 000, americans, live, in, jamaica, jamaica, is, regarded, as, a, bilingual, country, with, two, major, languages, in, use, by, the, population, the, official, language, is, jamaican, english, which, is, used, in, all, domains, of, public, life, including, the, government, the, legal, system, the,
