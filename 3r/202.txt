the, english, channel, also, known, as, the, channel, is, an, arm, of, the, atlantic, ocean, that, separates, southern, england, from, northern, france, it, links, to, the, southern, part, of, the, north, sea, by, the, strait, of, dover, at, its, northeastern, end, it, is, the, busiest, shipping, area, in, the, world, it, is, about, 560, kilometres, 300, nautical, miles, 350, statute, miles, long, and, varies, in, width, from, 240, km, 130, nmi, 150, mi, at, its, widest, to, 34, km, 18, nmi, 21, mi, at, its, narrowest, in, the, strait, of, dover, it, is, the, smallest, of, the, shallow, seas, around, the, continental, shelf, of, europe, covering, an, area, of, some, 75, 000, square, kilometres, 22, 000, square, nautical, miles, 29, 000, square, miles, the, channel, aided, the, united, kingdom, in, becoming, a, naval, superpower, serving, as, a, natural, defence, to, halt, attempted, invasions, such, as, in, the, napoleonic, wars, and, in, the, second, world, war, the, northern, english, coast, of, the, channel, is, more, populous, than, the, southern, french, coast, the, major, languages, spoken, in, this, region, are, english, and, french, the, name, first, appears, in, roman, sources, as, oceanus, britannicus, or, mare, britannicum, meaning, the, ocean, or, the, sea, of, the, britons, or, britann, variations, of, this, term, were, used, by, influential, writers, such, as, ptolemy, and, remained, popular, with, british, and, continental, authors, well, into, the, modern, era, other, latin, names, for, the, sea, include, oceanus, gallicus, the, gaulish, ocean, which, was, used, by, isidore, of, seville, in, the, sixth, century, the, term, british, sea, is, still, used, by, speakers, of, cornish, and, breton, with, the, sea, known, to, them, as, mor, bretannek, and, mor, breizh, respectively, while, it, is, likely, that, these, names, derive, from, the, latin, term, it, is, possible, that, they, predate, the, arrival, of, the, romans, in, the, area, the, modern, welsh, is, often, given, as, m, r, udd, the, lord, s, or, prince, s, sea, however, this, name, originally, described, both, the, channel, and, the, north, sea, combined, anglo, saxon, texts, make, reference, to, the, sea, as, s, s, south, sea, but, this, term, fell, out, of, favour, as, later, english, authors, followed, the, same, conventions, as, their, latin, and, norman, contemporaries, one, english, name, that, did, persist, was, the, narrow, seas, a, collective, term, for, the, channel, and, north, sea, as, england, followed, by, great, britain, and, the, united, kingdom, claimed, sovereignty, over, the, sea, a, royal, navy, admiral, was, appointed, with, maintaining, duties, in, the, two, seas, the, office, was, maintained, until, 1822, when, several, european, nations, including, the, united, kingdom, adopted, a, three, mile, 4, 8, km, limit, to, territorial, waters, the, word, channel, was, first, recorded, in, middle, english, in, the, 13th, century, and, was, borrowed, from, the, old, french, word, chanel, a, variant, form, of, chenel, canal, by, the, middle, of, the, fifteenth, century, an, italian, map, based, on, ptolemy, s, description, named, the, sea, as, britanicus, oceanus, nunc, canalites, anglie, ocean, of, the, britons, but, now, english, channel, the, map, is, possibly, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, english, channel, and, the, description, suggests, the, name, had, recently, been, adopted, in, the, sixteenth, century, dutch, maps, referred, to, the, sea, as, the, engelse, kanaal, english, channel, and, by, the, 1590s, william, shakespeare, used, the, word, channel, in, his, history, plays, of, henry, vi, suggesting, that, by, that, time, the, name, was, popularly, understood, by, english, people, by, the, eighteenth, century, the, name, english, channel, was, in, common, usage, in, england, following, the, acts, of, union, 1707, this, was, replaced, in, official, maps, and, documents, with, british, channel, or, british, sea, for, much, of, the, next, century, however, the, term, english, channel, remained, popular, and, was, finally, in, official, usage, by, the, nineteenth, century, the, french, name, la, manche, has, been, used, since, at, least, the, 17th, century, the, name, is, usually, said, to, refer, to, the, sleeve, french, la, manche, shape, of, the, channel, folk, etymology, has, derived, it, from, a, celtic, word, meaning, channel, that, is, also, the, source, of, the, name, for, the, minch, in, scotland, but, this, name, is, not, attested, before, the, 17th, century, and, french, and, british, sources, of, that, time, are, clear, about, its, etymology, the, name, in, french, has, been, directly, adapted, in, other, languages, as, either, a, calque, such, as, canale, della, manica, in, italian, or, a, direct, borrowing, such, as, canal, de, la, mancha, in, spanish, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, english, channel, as, the, strait, of, dover, french, pas, de, calais, at, the, channel, s, eastern, end, is, its, narrowest, point, while, its, widest, point, lies, between, lyme, bay, and, the, gulf, of, saint, malo, near, its, midpoint, well, on, the, continental, shelf, it, has, an, average, depth, of, about, 120, m, 390, ft, at, its, widest, yet, averages, about, 45, m, 148, ft, between, dover, and, calais, its, notable, sandbank, hazard, being, goodwin, sands, eastwards, from, there, the, adjoining, north, sea, reduces, to, about, 26, m, 85, ft, across, the, broad, fourteens, 14, fathoms, where, it, lies, over, the, southern, cusp, of, the, former, land, bridge, between, east, anglia, and, the, low, countries, the, north, sea, reaches, much, greater, depths, east, of, northern, britain, the, channel, descends, briefly, to, 180, m, 590, ft, in, the, submerged, valley, of, hurd, s, deep, 48, km, 30, mi, west, northwest, of, guernsey, there, are, several, major, islands, in, the, channel, the, most, notable, being, the, isle, of, wight, off, the, english, coast, and, the, channel, islands, british, crown, dependencies, off, the, coast, of, france, the, coastline, particularly, on, the, french, shore, is, deeply, indented, with, several, small, islands, close, to, the, coastline, including, chausey, and, mont, saint, michel, the, cotentin, peninsula, on, the, french, coast, juts, out, into, the, channel, with, the, wide, bay, of, the, seine, french, baie, de, seine, to, its, east, on, the, english, side, there, is, a, small, parallel, strait, the, solent, between, the, isle, of, wight, and, the, mainland, the, celtic, sea, is, to, the, west, of, the, channel, the, channel, acts, as, a, funnel, that, amplifies, the, tidal, range, from, less, than, a, metre, at, sea, in, eastern, places, to, more, than, 6, metres, in, the, channel, islands, the, west, coast, of, the, cotentin, peninsula, and, the, north, coast, of, brittany, in, monthly, spring, tides, the, time, difference, of, about, six, hours, between, high, water, at, the, eastern, and, western, limits, of, the, channel, is, indicative, of, the, tidal, range, being, amplified, further, by, resonance, amphidromic, points, are, the, bay, of, biscay, and, varying, more, in, precise, location, in, the, far, south, of, the, north, sea, meaning, both, those, associated, eastern, coasts, repel, the, tides, effectively, leaving, the, strait, of, dover, as, every, six, hours, the, natural, bottleneck, short, of, its, consequent, gravity, induced, repulsion, of, the, southward, tide, surge, of, the, north, sea, equally, from, the, atlantic, the, channel, does, not, experience, but, its, existence, is, necessary, to, explain, the, extent, of, north, sea, storm, surges, such, as, necessitate, the, thames, barrier, delta, works, zuiderzee, works, afsluitdijk, and, other, dams, in, the, uk, shipping, forecast, the, channel, is, divided, into, the, following, areas, from, the, east, the, full, english, channel, connecting, the, north, sea, to, the, western, atlantic, via, the, strait, of, dover, is, of, geologically, recent, origin, having, formed, late, in, the, pleistocene, period, the, english, channel, first, developed, as, an, arm, of, the, atlantic, ocean, during, the, pliocene, period, 5, 3, 2, 6, million, years, ago, as, a, result, of, differential, tectonic, uplift, along, pre, existing, tectonic, weaknesses, during, the, oligocene, and, miocene, periods, during, this, early, period, the, channel, did, not, connect, to, the, north, sea, with, britain, and, ireland, remaining, part, of, continental, europe, linked, by, an, unbroken, weald, artois, anticline, a, ridge, running, between, the, dover, and, calais, regions, during, pleistocene, glacial, periods, this, ridge, acted, as, a, natural, dam, holding, back, a, large, freshwater, pro, glacial, lake, in, the, doggerland, region, now, submerged, under, the, north, sea, during, this, period, the, north, sea, and, almost, all, of, the, british, isles, were, covered, by, ice, the, lake, was, fed, by, meltwater, from, the, baltic, and, from, the, caledonian, and, scandinavian, ice, sheets, that, joined, to, the, north, blocking, its, exit, the, sea, level, was, about, 120, m, 390, ft, lower, than, it, is, today, then, between, 450, 000, and, 180, 000, years, ago, at, least, two, catastrophic, glacial, lake, outburst, floods, breached, the, weald, artois, anticline, these, contributed, to, creating, some, of, the, deepest, parts, of, the, channel, such, as, hurd, s, deep, the, first, flood, of, 450, 000, years, ago, would, have, lasted, for, several, months, releasing, as, much, as, one, million, cubic, metres, of, water, per, second, the, flood, started, with, large, but, localised, waterfalls, over, the, ridge, which, excavated, depressions, now, known, as, the, fosses, dangeard, the, flow, eroded, the, retaining, ridge, causing, the, rock, dam, to, fail, and, releasing, lake, water, into, the, atlantic, after, multiple, episodes, of, changing, sea, level, during, which, the, fosses, dangeard, were, largely, infilled, by, various, layers, of, sediment, another, catastrophic, flood, some, 180, 000, years, ago, carved, a, large, bedrock, floored, valley, the, lobourg, channel, some, 500, m, wide, and, 25, m, deep, from, the, southern, north, sea, basin, through, the, centre, of, the, straits, of, dover, and, into, the, english, channel, it, left, streamlined, islands, longitudinal, erosional, grooves, and, other, features, characteristic, of, catastrophic, megaflood, events, still, present, on, the, sea, floor, and, now, revealed, by, high, resolution, sonar, through, the, scoured, channel, passed, a, river, the, channel, river, which, drained, the, combined, rhine, and, thames, westwards, to, the, atlantic, the, flooding, destroyed, the, ridge, that, connected, britain, to, continental, europe, although, a, land, connection, across, the, southern, north, sea, would, have, existed, intermittently, at, later, times, when, periods, of, glaciation, resulted, in, lowering, of, sea, levels, during, interglacial, periods, when, sea, levels, were, high, between, the, initial, flooding, 450, 000, years, ago, until, around, 180, 000, years, ago, the, channel, would, still, have, been, separated, from, the, north, sea, by, a, landbridge, to, the, north, of, the, strait, of, dover, the, strait, of, dover, at, this, time, formed, part, of, a, estuary, fed, by, the, thames, and, scheldt, restricting, interchange, of, marine, fauna, between, the, channel, and, the, north, sea, except, perhaps, by, occasional, overtopping, during, the, last, interglacial, eemian, 115, 130, 000, years, ago, the, connection, between, the, north, sea, and, the, english, channel, was, fully, open, as, it, is, today, resulting, in, britain, being, an, island, during, this, interval, before, lowered, sea, levels, reconnected, it, to, the, continent, during, the, last, glacial, period, from, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, to, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, rising, sea, levels, again, resulted, in, the, unimpeded, connection, between, the, north, sea, and, the, english, channel, resuming, due, to, the, sinking, of, doggerland, with, britain, again, becoming, an, island, as, a, busy, shipping, lane, the, channel, experiences, environmental, problems, following, accidents, involving, ships, with, toxic, cargo, and, oil, spills, indeed, over, 40, of, the, uk, incidents, threatening, pollution, occur, in, or, very, near, the, channel, one, occurrence, was, the, msc, napoli, which, on, 18, january, 2007, was, beached, with, nearly, 1700, tonnes, of, dangerous, cargo, in, lyme, bay, a, protected,

frequently, the, channel, is, thought, to, have, prevented, neanderthals, from, colonising, britain, during, the, last, interglacial, eemian, though, they, returned, to, britain, during, the, last, glacial, period, when, sea, levels, were, lower, the, channel, has, in, historic, times, been, both, an, easy, entry, for, seafaring, people, and, a, key, natural, defence, halting, invading, armies, while, in, conjunction, with, control, of, the, north, sea, allowing, britain, to, blockade, the, continent, the, most, significant, failed, invasion, threats, came, when, the, dutch, and, belgian,

invasions, include, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, and, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, while, the, concentration, of, excellent, harbours, in, the, western, channel, on, britain, s, south, coast, made, possible, the, largest, amphibious, invasion, in, history, the, normandy, landings, in, 1944, channel, naval, battles, include, the, battle, of, the, downs, 1639, battle, of, dover, 1652, the, battle, of, portland, 1653, and, the, battle, of, la, hougue, 1692, in, more, peaceful, times, the, channel, served, as, a, link, joining, shared, cultures, and, political, structures, particularly, the, huge, angevin, empire, from, 1135, to, 1217, for, nearly, a, thousand, years, the, channel, also, provided, a, link, between, the, modern, celtic, regions, and, languages, of, cornwall, and, brittany, brittany, was, founded, by, britons, who, fled, cornwall, and, devon, after, anglo, saxon, encroachment, in, brittany, there, is, a, region, known, as, cornouaille, cornwall, in, french, and, kernev, in, breton, in, ancient, times, there, was, also, a, domnonia, devon, in, brittany, as, well, in, february, 1684, ice, formed, on, the, sea,

43, ad, a, brisk, and, regular, trade, began, between, ports, in, roman, gaul, and, those, in, britain, this, traffic, continued, until, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, britain, in, 410, ad, after, which, the, early, anglo, saxons, left, less, clear, historical, records, in, the, power, vacuum, left, by, the, retreating, romans, the, germanic, angles, saxons, and, jutes, began, the, next, great, migration, across, the, north, sea, having, already, been, used, as, mercenaries, in, britain, by, the, romans, many, people, from, these, tribes, crossed, during, the, migration, period, conquering, and, perhaps, displacing, the, native, celtic, populations, the, attack, on, lindisfarne, in, 793, is, generally, considered, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, for, the, next, 250, years, the, scandinavian, raiders, of, norway, sweden, and, denmark, dominated, the, north, sea, raiding, monasteries, homes, and, towns, along, the, coast, and, along, the, rivers, that, ran, inland, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, they, began, to, settle, in, britain, in, 851, they, continued, to, settle, in, the, british, isles, and, the, continent, until, around, 1050, with, some, raids, recorded, along, the, channel, coast, of, england, including, at, wareham, portland, near, weymouth, and, along, the, river, teign, in, devon, the, fiefdom, of, normandy, was, created, for, the, viking, leader, rollo, also, known, as, robert, of, normandy, rollo, had, besieged, paris, but, in, 911, entered, vassalage, to, the, king, of, the, west, franks, charles, the, simple, through, the,

in, 1588, as, the, attempted, invasion, of, the, spanish, armada, was, defeated, by, the, combination, of, outstanding, naval, tactics, by, the, english, and, the, dutch, under, command, of, charles, howard, 1st, earl, of, nottingham, with, sir, francis, drake, second, in, command, and, the, following, stormy, weather, over, the, centuries, the, royal, navy, slowly, grew, to, be, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, the, building, of, the, british, empire, was, possible, only, because, the, royal, navy, eventually, managed, to, exercise, unquestioned, control, over, the, seas, around, europe, especially, the, channel, and, the, north, sea, during, the, seven, years, war, france, attempted, to, launch, an, invasion, of, britain, to, achieve, this, france, needed, to, gain, control, of, the, channel, for, several, weeks, but, was, thwarted, following, the, british, naval, victory, at, the, battle, of, quiberon, bay, in, 1759, and, was, unsuccessful, the, last, french, landing, on, english, soil, being, in, 1690, with, a, raid, on, teignmouth, although, the, last, french, raid, on, british, soil, was, a, raid, on, fishguard, wales, in, 1797, another, significant, challenge, to, british, domination, of, the, seas, came, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, battle, of, trafalgar, took, place, off, the, coast, of, spain, against, a, combined, french, and, spanish, fleet, and, was, won, by, admiral, horatio, nelson, ending, napoleon, s, plans, for, a, cross, channel, invasion, and, securing, british, dominance, of, the, seas, for, over, a, century, the, exceptional, strategic, importance, of, the, channel, as, a, tool, for, blockading, was, recognised, by, the, first, sea, lord, admiral, fisher, in, the, years, before, world, war, i, five, keys, lock, up, the,

crossing, signalled, a, change, in, the, function, of, the, channel, as, a, barrier, moat, for, england, against, foreign, enemies, because, the, kaiserliche, marine, surface, fleet, could, not, match, the, british, grand, fleet, the, germans, developed, submarine, warfare, which, was, to, become, a, far, greater, threat, to, britain, the, dover, patrol, set, up, just, before, the, war, started, escorted, cross, channel, troopships, and, prevented, submarines, from, sailing, in, the, channel, obliging, them, to, travel, to, the, atlantic, via, the, much, longer, route, around, scotland, on, land, the, german, army, attempted, to, capture, french, channel, ports, in, the, race, to, the, sea, but, although, the, trenches, are, often, said, to, have, stretched, from, the, frontier, of, switzerland, to, the, english, channel, they, reached, the, coast, at, the, north, sea, much, of, the, british, war, effort, in, flanders, was, a, bloody, but, successful, strategy, to, prevent, the, germans, reaching, the, channel, coast, at, the, outset, of, the, war, an, attempt, was, made, to, block, the, path, of, u, boats, through, the, dover, strait, with, naval, minefields, by, february, 1915, this, had, been, augmented, by, a, 25, kilometres, 16, mi, stretch, of, light, steel, netting, called, the, dover, barrage, which, it, was, hoped, would, ensnare, submerged, submarines, after, initial, success, the, germans, learned, how, to, pass, through, the, barrage, aided, by, the, unreliability, of, british, mines, on, 31, january, 1917, the, germans, resumed, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, leading, to, dire, admiralty, predictions, that, submarines, would, defeat, britain, by, november, the, most, dangerous, situation, britain, faced, in, either, world, war, the, battle, of, passchendaele, in, 1917, was, fought, to, reduce, the, threat, by, capturing, the, submarine, bases, on, the, belgian, coast, though, it, was, the, introduction, of, convoys, and, not, capture, of, the, bases, that, averted, defeat, in, april, 1918, the, dover, patrol, carried, out, the, zeebrugge, raid, against, the, u, boat, bases, during, 1917, the, dover, barrage, was, re, sited, with, improved, mines, and, more, effective, nets, aided, by, regular, patrols, by, small, warships, equipped, with, powerful, searchlights, a, german, attack, on, these, vessels, resulted, in, the, battle, of, dover, strait, in, 1917, a, much, more, ambitious, attempt, to, improve, the, barrage, by, installing, eight, massive, concrete, towers, across, the, strait, was, called, the, admiralty, m, n, scheme, but, only, two, towers, were, nearing, completion, at, the, end, of, the, war, and, the, project, was, abandoned, the, naval, blockade, in, the, channel, and, north, sea, was, one, of, the, decisive, factors, in, the, german, defeat, in, 1918, during, the, second, world, war, naval, activity, in, the, european, theatre, was, primarily, limited, to, the, atlantic, during, the, battle, of, france, in, may, 1940, the, german, forces, succeeded, in, capturing, both, boulogne, and, calais, thereby, threatening, the, line, of, retreat, for, the, british, expeditionary,

the, early, stages, of, the, battle, of, britain, featured, german, air, attacks, on, channel, shipping, and, ports, despite, these, early, successes, against, shipping, the, germans, did, not, win, the, air, supremacy, necessary, for, operation, sealion, the, projected, cross, channel, invasion, the, channel, subsequently, became, the, stage, for, an, intensive, coastal, war, featuring, submarines, minesweepers, and, fast, attack, craft, the, narrow, waters, of, the, channel, were, considered, too, dangerous, for, major, warships, until, the, normandy, landings, with, the, exception, for, the, german, kriegsmarine, of, the, channel, dash, operation, cerberus, in, february, 1942, and, this, required, the, support, of, the, luftwaffe, in, operation, thunderbolt, dieppe, was, the,
