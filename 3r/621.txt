emancipation, in, 1838, almost, all, of, the, former, slaves, abandoned, the, plantations, and, indians, were, brought, to, the, country, under, indenture, contracts, from, 1838, until, the, end, of, the, system, in, 1917, the, production, of, balat, natural, latex, was, once, a, big, business, in, guyana, most, of, the, balat, bleeding, in, guyana, took, place, in, the, foothills, of, the, kanuku, mountains, in, the, rupununi, savannah, early, exploitation, also, took, place, in, the, north, west, district, but, most, of, the, trees, in, the, area, were, destroyed, by, illicit, bleeding, methods, that, involved, cutting, down, the, trees, rather, than, making, incisions, in, them, uses, of, balat, included, the, making, of, cricket, balls, temporary, dental, fillings, and, the, crafting, of, figurines, and, other, decorative, items, particularly, by, the, macushi, people, when, the, country, gained, independence, from, british, rule, a, policy, of, nationalisation, was, enacted, by, forbes, burnham, to, address, the, inequities, that, were, established, by, plantation, based, colonial, rule, all, large, scale, industries, such, as, foreign, owned, bauxite, mining, reynolds, metals, and, rio, tinto, s, alcan, and, sugar, guysuco, operations, were, taken, over, by, the, government, however, the, economy, under, nationalisation, was, plagued, by, problems, political, instability, leading, to, an, exodus, of, skilled, labour, inexperienced, management, aging, infrastructure, poor, international, market, conditions, also, expanded, the, country, s, debt, the, guyanese, economy, rebounded, slightly, and, exhibited, moderate, economic, growth, after, 1999, due, to, expansion, in, the, agricultural, and, mining, sectors, a, more, favourable, atmosphere, for, business, initiatives, a, more, realistic, exchange, rate, fairly, low, inflation, and, the, continued, support, of, international, organisations, guyana, held, huge, amounts, of, debt, which, have, been, written, off, through, various, international, agencies, in, 2003, guyana, qualified, for, us, 329, million, of, debt, relief, in, addition, to, the, us, 256, million, from, the, original,

six, different, taxes, prior, to, the, implementation, of, the, vat, it, had, been, relatively, easy, to, evade, sales, tax, and, many, businesses, were, in, violation, of, tax, code, many, businesses, opposed, vat, introduction, because, of, the, extra, paperwork, required, however, the, government, has, remained, firm, on, the, vat, replacing, several, taxes, with, one, flat, tax,
