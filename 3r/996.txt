lebanon, mountains, mark, the, border, between, syria, and, lebanon, the, range, has, peaks, of, over, 10, 000, ft, 3, 000, m, and, blocks, precipitation, from, the, mediterranean, sea, so, the, region, of, damascus, is, sometimes, subject, to, droughts, however, in, ancient, times, the, barada, river, mitigated, this, which, originates, from, mountain, streams, fed, by, melting, snow, damascus, is, surrounded, by, the, ghouta, irrigated, farmland, where, many, vegetables, cereals, and, fruits, have, been, farmed, since, ancient, times, maps, of, roman, syria, indicate, that, the, barada, river, emptied, into, a, lake, of, some, size, east, of, damascus, today, it, is, called, bahira, atayba, the, hesitant, lake, because, in, years, of, severe, drought, it, does, not, even, exist, the, modern, city, has, an, area, of, 105, km, 2, 41, sq, mi, out, of, which, 77, km, 2, 30, sq, mi, is, urban, while, jabal, qasioun, occupies, the, rest, the, old, city, of, damascus, enclosed, by, the, city, walls, lies, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, barada, which, is, almost, dry, 3, cm, 1, in, left, to, the, southeast, north, and, northeast, it, is, surrounded, by, suburban, areas, whose, history, stretches, back, to, the, middle, ages, midan, in, the, southwest, sarouja, and, imara, in, the, north, and, north, west, these, neighborhoods, originally, arose, on, roads, leading, out, of, the, city, near, the, tombs, of, religious, figures, in, the, 19th, century, outlying, villages, developed, on, the, slopes, of, jabal, qasioun, overlooking, the, city, already, the, site, of, the, al, salihiyah, neighborhood, centered, on, the, important, shrine, of, medieval, andalusian, sheikh, and, philosopher, ibn, arabi, these, new, neighborhoods, were, initially, settled, by, kurdish, soldiery, and, muslim, refugees, from, the, europe, regions, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, had, fallen, under, christian, rule, thus, they, were, known, as, al, akrad, the, kurds, and, al, muhajirin, the, migrants, they, lay, 2, 3, km, 1, 2, mi, north, of, the, old, city, from, the, late, 19th, century, on, a, modern, administrative, and, commercial, center, began, to, spring, up, to, the, west, of, the, old, city, around, the, barada, centered, on, the, area, known, as, al, marjeh, or, the, meadow, al, marjeh, soon, became, the, name, of, what, was, initially, the, central, square, of, modern, damascus, with, the, city, hall, in, it, the, courts, of, justice, post, office, and, railway, station, stood, on, higher, ground, slightly, to, the, south, a, europeanized, residential, quarter, soon, began, to, be, built, on, the, road, leading, between, al, marjeh, and, al, salihiyah, the, commercial, and, administrative, center, of, the, new, city, gradually, shifted, northwards, slightly, towards, this, area, in, the, 20th, century, newer, suburbs, developed, north, of, the, barada, and, to, some, extent, to, the, south, invading, the, ghouta, oasis, in, 1956, 1957, the, new, neighborhood, of, yarmouk, became, a, second, home, to, many, palestinian, refugees, city, planners, preferred, to, preserve, the, ghouta, as, far, as, possible, and, in, the, later, 20th, century, some, of, the, main, areas, of, development, were, to, the, north, in, the, western, mezzeh, neighborhood, and, most, recently, along, the, barada, valley, in, dummar, in, the, northwest, and, on, the, slopes, of, the, mountains, at, barzeh, in, the, north, east, poorer, areas, often, built, without, official, approval, have, mostly, developed, south, of, the, main, city, damascus, used, to, be, surrounded, by, an, oasis, the, ghouta, region, arabic, romanized, al, watered, by, the, barada, river, the, fijeh, spring, west, along, the, barada, valley, used, to, provide, the, city, with, drinking, water, and, various, sources, to, the, west, are, tapped, by, water, contractors, the, flow, of, the, barada, dropped, with, the, rapid, expansion, of, housing, and, industry, in, the, city, and, it, is, almost, dry, the, lower, aquifers, are, polluted, by, the, city, s, runoff, from, heavily, used, roads, industry, and, sewage, damascus, has, a, cool, arid, climate, bwk, in, the, k, ppen, geiger, system, due, to, the, rain, shadow, effect, of, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, and, the, prevailing, ocean, currents, summers, are, prolonged, dry, and, hot, with, less, humidity, winters, are, cool, and, somewhat, rainy, snowfall, is, infrequent, autumn, is, brief, and, mild, but, has, the, most, drastic, temperature, change, unlike, spring, where, the, transition, to, summer, is, more, gradual, and, steady, annual, rainfall, is, around, 130, mm, 5, in, occurring, from, october, to, may, carbon, 14, dating, at, tell, ramad, on, the, outskirts, of, damascus, suggests, that, the, site, may, have, been, occupied, since, the, second, half, of, the, seventh, millennium, bc, possibly, around, 6300, bc, however, evidence, of, settlement, in, the, wider, barada, basin, dating, back, to, 9000, bc, exists, although, no, large, scale, settlement, was, present, within, damascus, walls, until, the, second, millennium, bc, some, of, the, earliest, egyptian, records, are, from, 1350, bc, amarna, letters, when, damascus, called, dimasqu, was, ruled, by, king, biryawaza, the, damascus, region, as, well, as, the, rest, of, syria, became, a, battleground, circa, 1260, bc, between, the, hittites, from, the, north, and, the, egyptians, from, the, south, ending, with, a, signed, treaty, between, hattusili, iii, and, ramesses, ii, where, the, former, handed, over, control, of, the, damascus, area, to, ramesses, ii, in, 1259, bc, the, arrival, of, the, sea, peoples, around, 1200, bc, marked, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, in, the, region, and, brought, about, new, development, of, warfare, damascus, was, only, a, peripheral, part, of, this, picture, which, mostly, affected, the, larger, population, centers, of, ancient, syria, however, these, events, contributed, to, the, development, of, damascus, as, a, new, influential, center, that, emerged, with, the, transition, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, iron, age, damascus, is, mentioned, in, genesis, 14, 15, as, existing, at, the, time, of, the, war, of, the, kings, according, to, the, 1st, century, jewish, historian, flavius, josephus, in, his, twenty, one, volume, antiquities, of, the, jews, damascus, along, with, trachonitis, was, founded, by, uz, the, son, of, aram, in, antiquities, i, 7, josephus, reports, nicolaus, of, damascus, in, the, fourth, book, of, his, history, says, thus, abraham, reigned, at, damascus, being, a, foreigner, who, came, with, an, army, out, of, the, land, above, babylon, called, the, land, of, the, chaldeans, but, after, a, long, time, he, got, him, up, and, removed, from, that, country, also, with, his, people, and, went, into, the, land, then, called, the, land, of, canaan, but, now, the, land, of, judea, and, this, when, his, posterity, became, a, multitude, as, to, which, posterity, of, his, we, relate, their, history, in, another, work, now, the, name, of, abraham, is, even, still, famous, in, the, country, of, damascus, and, there, is, a, village, named, after, him, the, habitation, of, abraham, damascus, is, first, documented, as, an, important, city, during, the, arrival, of, the, aramaeans, a, semitic, people, in, the, 11th, century, bc, by, the, start, of, the, first, millennium, bc, several, aramaic, kingdoms, were, formed, as, aramaeans, abandoned, their, nomadic, lifestyle, and, formed, federated, tribal, states, one, of, these, kingdoms, was, aram, damascus, centered, on, its, capital, damascus, the, aramaeans, who, entered, the, city, without, battle, adopted, the, name, dimashqu, for, their, new, home, noticing, the, agricultural, potential, of, the, still, undeveloped, and, sparsely, populated, area, they, established, the, water, distribution, system, of, damascus, by, constructing, canals, and, tunnels, which, maximized, the, efficiency, of, the, river, barada, the, romans, and, the, umayyads, later, improved, the, same, network, and, still, forms, the, basis, of, the, water, system, of, the, old, part, of, the, city, today, the, aramaeans, initially, turned, damascus, into, an, outpost, of, a, loose, federation, of, aramaean, tribes, known, as, aram, zobah, based, in, the, beqaa, valley, the, city, would, gain, pre, eminence, in, southern, syria, when, ezron, the, claimant, to, aram, zobah, s, throne, who, was, denied, kingship, of, the, federation, fled, beqaa, and, captured, damascus, by, force, in, 965, bc, ezron, overthrew, the, city, s, tribal, governor, and, founded, the, independent, entity, of, aram, damascus, as, this, new, state, expanded, south, it, prevented, the, kingdom, of, israel, from, spreading, north, and, the, two, kingdoms, soon, clashed, as, they, both, sought, to, dominate, trading, hegemony, in, the, east, under, ezron, s, grandson, ben, hadad, i, 880, 841, bc, and, his, successor, hazael, damascus, annexed, bashan, modern, day, hauran, region, and, went, on, the, offensive, with, israel, this, conflict, continued, until, the, early, 8th, century, bc, when, ben, hadad, ii, was, captured, by, israel, after, unsuccessfully, besieging, samaria, as, a, result, he, granted, israel, trading, rights, in, damascus, another, possible, reason, for, the, treaty, between, aram, damascus, and, israel, was, the, common, threat, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, which, was, attempting, to, expand, into, the, mediterranean, coast, in, 853, bc, king, hadadezer, of, damascus, led, a, levantine, coalition, that, included, forces, from, the, northern, aram, hamath, kingdom, and, troops, supplied, by, king, ahab, of, israel, in, the, battle, of, qarqar, against, the, neo, assyrian, army, aram, damascus, came, out, victorious, temporarily, preventing, the, assyrians, from, encroaching, into, syria, however, after, hadadzezer, was, killed, by, his, successor, hazael, the, levantine, alliance, collapsed, aram, damascus, attempted, to, invade, israel, but, was, interrupted, by, the, renewed, assyrian, invasion, hazael, ordered, a, retreat, to, the, walled, part, of, damascus, while, the, assyrians, plundered, the, remainder, of, the, kingdom, unable, to, enter, the, city, they, declared, their, supremacy, in, the, hauran, and, beqa, a, valleys, by, the, 8th, century, bc, damascus, was, practically, engulfed, by, the, assyrians, and, entered, a, dark, age, nonetheless, it, remained, the, economic, and, cultural, center, of, the, near, east, as, well, as, the, arameaen, resistance, in, 727, a, revolt, took, place, in, the, city, but, was, put, down, by, assyrian, forces, after, assyria, led, by, tiglath, pileser, iii, went, on, a, wide, scale, campaign, of, quelling, revolts, throughout, syria, damascus, became, subjugated, by, their, rule, a, positive, effect, of, this, was, stability, for, the, city, and, benefits, from, the, spice, and, incense, trade, with, arabia, in, 694, bc, the, town, was, called, a, imeri, u, akkadian, and, its, governor, was, named, ilu, iss, ya, however, assyrian, authority, was, dwindling, by, 609, 605, bc, and, syria, palestine, was, falling, into, the, orbit, of, pharaoh, necho, ii, s, egypt, in, 572, bc, all, of, syria, had, been, conquered, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, of, the, neo, babylonians, but, the, status, of, damascus, under, babylon, is, relatively, unknown, damascus, was, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, after, the, death, of, alexander, in, 323, bc, damascus, became, the, site, of, a, struggle, between, the, seleucid, and, ptolemaic, empires, the, control, of, the, city, passed, frequently, from, one, empire, to, the, other, seleucus, i, nicator, one, of, alexander, s, generals, made, antioch, the, capital, of, his, vast, empire, which, led, to, the, decline, of, damascus, importance, compared, with, new, seleucid, cities, such, as, syrian, laodicea, in, the, north, later, demetrius, iii, philopator, rebuilt, the, city, according, to, the, greek, hippodamian, system, and, renamed, it, demetrias, in, 64, bc, the, roman, general, pompey, annexed, the, western, part, of, syria, the, romans, occupied, damascus, and, subsequently, incorporated, it, into, the, league, of, ten, cities, known, as, the, decapolis, which, themselves, were, incorporated, into, the, province, of, syria, and, granted, autonomy, the, city, of, damascus, was, entirely, redesigned, by, the, romans, after, pompey, conquered, the, region, still, today, the, old, town, of, damascus, retains, the, rectangular, shape, of, the, roman, city, with, its, two, main, axes, the, decumanus, maximus, east, west, known, today, as, the, via, recta, and, the, cardo, north, south, the, decumanus, being, about, twice, as, long, the, romans, built, a, monumental, gate, which, still, survives, at, the, eastern, end, of, decumanus, maximus, the, gate, originally, had, three, arches, the, central, arch, was, for, chariots, while, the, side, arches, were, for, pedestrians, in, 23, bc, herod, the, great, was, given, lands, controlled, by, zenodorus, by, caesar, augustus, and, some, scholars, believe, that, herod, was, also, granted, control, of, damascus, as, well, the, control, of, damascus, reverted, to, syria, either, upon, the, death, of, herod, the, great, or, was, part, of, the, lands, given, to, herod, philip, which, were, given, to, syria, with, his, death, in, 33, 34, ad, it, is, speculated, that, control, of, damascus, was, gained, by, aretas, iv, philopatris, of, nabatea, between, the, death, of, herod, philip, in, 33, 34, ad, and, the, death, of, aretas, in, 40, ad, but, there, is, substantial, evidence, against, aretas, controlling, the, city, before, 37, ad, and, many, reasons, why, it, could, not, have, been, a, gift, from, caligula, between, 37, and, 40, ad, in, fact, all, these, theories, stem, not, from, any, actual, evidence, outside, the, new, testament, but, rather, a, certain, understanding, of, 2, corinthians, 11, 32, and, in, reality, neither, from, archaeological, evidence, secular, historical, sources, nor, new, testament, texts, can, nabatean, sovereignty, over, damascus, in, the, first, century, ad, be, proven, roman, emperor, trajan, who, annexed, the, nabataean, kingdom, creating, the, province, of, arabia, petraea, had, previously, been, in, damascus, as, his, father, marcus, ulpius, traianus, served, as, governor, of, syria, from, 73, to, 74, ad, where, he, met, the, nabatean, architect, and, engineer, apollodorus, of, damascus, who, joined, him, in, rome, when, he, was, a, consul, in, 91, ad, and, later, built, several, monuments, during, the, 2nd, century, ad, damascus, became, a, metropolis, by, the, beginning, of, the, 2nd, century, and, in, 222, it, was, upgraded, to, a, colonia, by, the, emperor, septimius, severus, during, the, pax, romana, damascus, and, the, roman, province, of, syria, in, general, began, to, prosper, damascus, s, importance, as, a, caravan, city, was, evident, with, the, trade, routes, from, southern, arabia, palmyra, petra, and, the, silk, routes, from, china, all, converging, on, it, the, city, satisfied, the, roman, demands, for, eastern, luxuries, circa, 125, ad, the, roman, emperor, hadrian, promoted, the, city, of, damascus, to, metropolis, of, coele, syria, little, remains, of, the, architecture, of, the, romans, but, the, town, planning, of, the, old, city, did, have, a, lasting, effect, the, roman, architects, brought, together, the, greek, and, aramaean, foundations, of, the, city, and, fused, them, into, a, new, layout, measuring, approximately, 1, 500, by, 750, m, 4, 920, by, 2, 460, ft, surrounded, by, a, city, wall, the, city, wall, contained, seven, gates, but, only, the, eastern, gate, bab, sharqi, remains, from, the, roman, period, roman, damascus, lies, mostly, at, depths, of, up, to, five, meters, 16, feet, below, the, modern, city, the, old, borough, of, bab, tuma, was, developed, at, the, end, of, the, roman, byzantine, era, by, the, local, eastern, orthodox, community, according, to, the, acts, of, the, apostles, saint, paul, and, saint, thomas, both, lived, in, that, neighborhood, roman, catholic, historians, also, consider, bab, tuma, to, be, the, birthplace, of, several, popes, such, as, john, v, and, gregory, iii, accordingly, there, was, a, community, of, jewish, christians, who, converted, to, christianity, with, the, advent, of, saint, paul, s, proselytization, during, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, the, city, was, besieged, and, captured, by, shahrbaraz, in, 613, along, with, a, large, number, of, byzantine, troops, as, prisoners, and, was, in, sasanian, hands, until, near, the, end, of, the, war, muhammad, s, first, indirect, interaction, with, the, people, of, damascus, was, when, he, sent, a, letter, through, his, companion, shiya, ibn, wahab, to, harith, ibn, abi, shamir, the, king, of, damascus, in, his, letter, muhammad, stated, peace, be, upon, him, who, follows, true, guidance, be, informed, that, my, religion, shall, prevail, everywhere, you, should, accept, islam, and, whatever, under, your, command, shall, remain, yours, after, most, of, the, syrian, countryside, was, conquered, by, the, rashidun, caliphate, during, the, reign, of, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, damascus, itself, was, conquered, by, the, arab, muslim, general, khalid, ibn, al, walid, in, august, september, 634, ce, his, army, had, previously, attempted, to, capture, the, city, in, april, 634, but, without, success, with, damascus, now, in, muslim, arab, hands, the, byzantines, alarmed, at, the, loss, of, their, most, prestigious, city, in, the, near, east, had, decided, to, wrest, back, control, of, it, under, emperor, heraclius, the, byzantines, fielded, an, army, superior, to, that, of, the, rashidun, in, manpower, they, advanced, into, southern, syria, during, the, spring, of, 636, and, consequently, khalid, ibn, al, walid, s, forces, withdrew, from, damascus, to, prepare, for, renewed, confrontation, in, august, the, two, sides, met, along, the, yarmouk, river, where, they, fought, a, major, battle, which, ended, in, a, decisive, muslim, victory, solidifying, muslim, rule, in, syria, and, palestine, while, the, muslims, administered, the, city, the, population, of, damascus, remained, mostly, christian, eastern, orthodox, and, monophysite, with, a, growing, community, of, muslims, from, mecca, medina, and, the, syrian, desert, the, governor, assigned, to, the, city, which, had, been, chosen, as, the, capital, of, islamic, syria, was, mu, awiya, i, following, the, fourth, rashidun, caliph, ali, s, death, in, 661, mu, awiya, was, chosen, as, the, caliph, of, the, expanding, islamic, empire, because, of, the, vast, amounts, of, assets, his, clan, the, umayyads, owned, in, the, city, and, because, of, its, traditional, economic, and, social, links, with, the, hijaz, as, well, as, the, christian, arab, tribes, of, the, region,

later, hisham, chose, resafa, following, the, murder, of, the, latter, in, 743, the, caliphate, of, the, umayyads, which, by, then, stretched, from, spain, to, india, was, crumbling, as, a, result,

rule, of, damascus, was, brief, lasting, only, until, 906, before, being, replaced, by, the, qarmatians, who, were, adherents, of, shia, islam, due, to, their, inability, to, control, the, vast, amount, of, land, they, occupied, the, qarmatians, withdrew, from, damascus, and, a, new, dynasty, the, ikhshidids, took, control, of, the, city, they, maintained, the, independence, of, damascus, from, the, arab, hamdanid, dynasty, of, aleppo, 967, a, period, of, instability, in, the, city, followed, with, a, qarmatian, raid, in, 968, a, byzantine, raid, in, 970, and, increasing, pressures, from, the, fatimids, in, the, south, and, the, hamdanids, in, the, north, the, shia, fatimids, gained, control, in, 970, inflaming, hostilities, between, them, and, the, sunni, arabs, of, the, city, who, frequently, revolted, a, turk, alptakin, drove, out, the, fatimids, five, years, later, and, through, diplomacy, prevented, the, byzantines, during, the, syrian, campaigns, of, john, tzimiskes, from, attempting, to, annex, the, city, however, by, 977, the, fatimids, under, caliph, al, aziz, wrested, back, control, of, the, city, and, tamed, sunni, dissidents, the, arab, geographer, al,

a, brief, period, of, stability, that, ended, with, the, reign, of, al, hakim, 996, 1021, in, 998, hundreds, of, damascus, citizens, were, rounded, up, and, executed, by, him, for, incitement, three, years, after, al, hakim, s, mysterious, disappearance, a, rebellion, was, initiated, in, southern, syria, against, the, fatimids, but, was, stifled, by, the, fatimid, turkish, governor, of, syria, and, palestine, anushtakin, al, duzbari, in, 1029, this, victory, gave, the, latter, mastery, over, syria, displeasing, his, fatimid, overlords, but, gaining, the, admiration, of, damascus, citizens, he, was, exiled, by, fatimid, authorities, to, aleppo, where, he, died, in, 1041, from, that, date, to, 1063, there, are, no, known, records, of, the, city, s, history, by, then, damascus, lacked, a, city, administration, had, an, enfeebled, economy, and, a, greatly, reduced, population, with, the, arrival, of, the, seljuq, turks, in, the, late, 11th, century, damascus, again, became, the, capital, of, independent, states, it, was, ruled, by, abu, sa, id, taj, ad, dawla, tutush, i, starting, in, 1079, and, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, abu, nasr, duqaq, in, 1095, the, seljuqs,

status, and, a, revived, role, in, commerce, in, addition, the, city, s, sunni, majority, enjoyed, being, a, part, of, the, larger, sunni, framework, effectively, governed, by, various, turkic, dynasties, who, in, turn, were, under, the, moral, authority, of, the, baghdad, based, abbasids, while, the, rulers, of, damascus, were, preoccupied, in, conflict, with, their, fellow, seljuqs, in, aleppo, and, diyarbakir, the, crusaders, who, arrived, in, the, levant, in, 1097, conquered, jerusalem, mount, lebanon, and, palestine, duqaq, seemed, to, have, been, content, with, crusader, s, rule, as, a, buffer, between, his, dominion, and, the, fatimid, caliphate, of, egypt, toghtekin, however, saw, the, western, invaders, as, a, viable, threat, to, damascus, which, at, the, time, nominally, included, homs, the, beqaa, valley, hauran, and, the, golan, heights, as, part, of, its, territories, with, military, support, from, sharaf, al, din, mawdud, of, mosul, toghtekin, managed, to, halt,

a, truce, with, the, crusaders, in, 1110, in, 1126, the, crusader, army, led, by, baldwin, ii, fought, burid, forces, led, by, toghtekin, at, marj, al, saffar, near, damascus, however, despite, their, tactical, victory, the, crusaders, failed, in, their, objective, to, capture, damascus, following, toghtekin, s, death, in, 1128, his, son, taj, al, muluk, buri, became, the, nominal, ruler, of, damascus, coincidentally, the, seljuq, prince, of, mosul, imad, al, din, zengi, took, power, in, aleppo, and, gained, a, mandate, from, the, abbasids, to, extend, his, authority, to, damascus, in, 1129, around, 6, 000, isma, ili, muslims, were, killed, in, the, city, along, with, their, leaders, the, sunnis, were, provoked, by, rumors, alleging, there, was, a, plot, by, the, isma, ilis, who, controlled, the, strategic, fort, at, banias, to, aid, the, crusaders, in, capturing, damascus, in, return, for, control, of, tyre, soon, after, the, massacre, the, crusaders, aimed, to, take, advantage, of, the, unstable, situation, and, launch, an, assault, against, damascus, with, nearly, 2, 000, knights, and, 10, 000, infantry, however, buri, allied, with, zengi, and, managed, to,

he, was, murdered, in, 1135, on, secret, orders, from, his, mother, safwat, al, mulk, zumurrud, isma, il, s, brother, shihab, al, din, mahmud, replaced, him, meanwhile, zengi, intent, on, putting, damascus, under, his, control, married, safwat, al, mulk, in, 1138, mahmud, s, reign, then, ended, in, 1139, after, he, was, killed, for, relatively, unknown, reasons, by, members, of, his, family, mu, in, al, din, unur, his, mamluk, slave, soldier, took, effective, power, of, the, city, prompting, zengi, with, safwat, al, mulk, s, backing, to, lay, siege, against, damascus, the, same, year, in, response, damascus, allied, with, the, crusader, kingdom, of, jerusalem, to, resist, zengi, s, forces, consequently, zengi, withdrew, his, army, and, focused, on, campaigns, against, northern, syria, in, 1144, zengi, conquered, edessa, a, crusader, stronghold, which, led, to, a, new, crusade, from, europe, in, 1148, in, the, meantime, zengi, was, assassinated, and, his, territory, was, divided, among, his, sons, one, of, whom, nur, ad, din, emir, of, aleppo, made, an, alliance, with, damascus, when, the, european, crusaders, arrived, they, and, the, nobles, of, jerusalem, agreed, to, attack, damascus, their, siege, however, was, a, complete, failure, when, the, city, seemed, to, be, on, the, verge, of, collapse, the, crusader, army, suddenly, moved, against, another, section, of, the, walls, and, was, driven, back, by, 1154, damascus, was, firmly, under, nur, ad, din, s, control, in, 1164, king, amalric, of, jerusalem, invaded, fatimid, egypt, requested, help, from, nur, ad, din,

better, known, as, saladin, who, defeated, a, joint, crusader, byzantine, siege, of, damietta, saladin, eventually, overthrew, the, fatimid, caliphs, and, established, himself, as, sultan, of, egypt, he, also, began, to, assert, his, independence, from, nur, ad, din, and, with, the, death, of, both, amalric, and, nur, ad, din, in, 1174, he, was, well, placed, to, begin, exerting, control, over, damascus, and, nur, ad, din, s, other, syrian, possessions, in, 1177, saladin, was, defeated, by, the, crusaders, at, the, battle, of, montgisard, despite, his, numerical, superiority, saladin, also, besieged, kerak, in, 1183, but, was, forced, to, withdraw, he, finally, launched, a, full, invasion, of, jerusalem, in, 1187, and, annihilated, the, crusader, army, at, the, battle, of, hattin, in, july, acre, fell, to, saladin, soon, after, and, jerusalem, itself, was, captured, in, october, these, events, shocked, europe, resulting, in, the, third, crusade, in, 1189, led, by, richard, i, of,

in, 1192, saladin, allowed, pilgrimages, to, be, made, to, jerusalem, allowing, the, crusaders, to, fulfill, their, vows, after, which, they, all, returned, home, local, crusader, barons, set, about, rebuilding, their, kingdom, from, acre, and, the, other, coastal, cities, saladin, died, in, 1193, and, there, were, frequent, conflicts, between, different, ayyubid, sultans, ruling, in, damascus,
