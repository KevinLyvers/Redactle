production, stream, and, exported, gas, was, pumped, back, down, into, the, reservoir, at, around, the, same, time, construction, commenced, on, a, 500, km, 310, mi, subsea, natural, gas, pipeline, connecting, the, bayu, undan, processing, facility, to, a, liquefied, natural, gas, plant, situated, at, wickham, point, in, darwin, harbour, since, the, completion, of, the, pipeline, and, the, darwin, lng, plant, in, 2005, gas, produced, offshore, at, bayu, undan, is, now, transported, to, the, darwin, plant, where, it, is, converted, into, a, liquid, and, transported, to, japan, under, long, term, sales, contracts, timor, leste, has, made, as, of, 2017, over, 18, billion, from, bayu, undan, since, production, began, however, it, is, predicted, its, reserves, will, be, exhausted, by, 2023, the, ichthys, gas, field, is, a, natural, gas, field, located, in, the, timor, sea, off, the, northwestern, coast, of, australia, the, field, is, located, 220, km, offshore, western, australia, and, 820, km, southwest, of, darwin, with, an, average, water, depth, of, approximately, 250, metres, it, was, discovered, in, 2000, first, gas, from, the, ichthys, field, was, achieved, on, 30, july, 2018, aed, oil, owns, the, large, oil, project, at, puffin, oilfield, and, woodside, petroleum, is, producing, oil, at, the, laminaria, oilfield, the, greater, sunrise, gas, field, discovered, in, 1974, is, one, of, the, largest, in, the, area, and, is, expected, to, earn, east, timor, several, billion, dollars, in, royalty, revenues, woodside, petroleum, plans, to, process, gas, from, greater, sunrise, via, a, floating, platform, however, xanana, gusm, o, east, timor, s, prime, minister, opposes, this, plan, and, instead, wants, the, gas, to, go, to, bea, o, via, a, pipeline, for, processing, since, 2018, santos, has, sought, to, establish, the, barossa, offshore, gas, project, to, exploit, a, gas, field, in, order, to, supply, the, darwin, liquefield, natural, gas, lng, onshore, terminal, when, gas, from, bayu, undan, runs, out, in, the, 2020s, this, has, been, opposed, by, dangalaba, and, larrakia, people, as, well, as, climate, justice, organisations, since, the, discovery, of, petroleum, in, the, timor, sea, in, the, 1970s, there, have, been, disputes, surrounding, the, rights, to, ownership, and, exploitation, of, the, resources, situated, in, a, part, of,

of, the, treaty, royalties, on, petroleum, production, in, the, jpda, are, split, in, a, 90, 10, ratio, between, east, timor, and, australia, it, has, been, criticised, because, the, treaty, did, not, finalise, the, maritime, boundary, between, east, timor, and, australia, the, australia, timor, leste, treaty, establishing, their, maritime, boundaries, in, the, timor, sea, was, signed, on, 6,
