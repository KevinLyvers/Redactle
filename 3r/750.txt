city, is, a, highly, symbolic, event, for, example, the, capital, city, is, usually, but, not, always, a, primary, target, in, a, war, as, capturing, it, usually, guarantees, capture, of, much, of, the, enemy, government, victory, for, the, attacking, forces, or, at, the, very, least, demoralization, for, the, defeated, forces, in, ancient, china, where, governments, were, massive, centralized, bureaucracies, with, little, flexibility, on, the, provincial, level, a, dynasty, could, easily, be, toppled, with, the, fall, of, its, capital, in, the, three, kingdoms, period, both, shu, and, wu,

generals, and, troops, guarding, the, borders, from, mongols, and, manchus, the, ming, was, destroyed, when, li, zicheng, took, their, seat, of, power, and, this, pattern, repeats, itself, in, chinese, history, until, the, fall, of, the, traditional, confucian, monarchy, in, the, 20th, century, after, the, qing, dynasty, s, collapse, decentralization, of, authority, and, improved, transportation, and, communication, technologies, allowed, both, the, chinese, nationalists, and, chinese, communists, to, rapidly, relocate, capitals, and, keep, their, leadership, structures, intact, during, the, great, crisis, of, japanese, invasion, national, capitals, were, arguably, less, important, as, military, objectives, in, other, parts, of, the, world, including, the, west, because, of, socioeconomic, trends, toward, localized, authority, a, strategic, modus, operandi, especially, popular, after, the, development, of, feudalism, and, reaffirmed, by, the, development, of, democratic, and, capitalistic, philosophies, in, 1204, after, the, latin, crusaders, captured, the, byzantine, capital, constantinople, byzantine, forces, were, able, to, regroup, in, several, provinces, provincial, noblemen, managed, to, reconquer, the, capital, after, 60, years, and, preserve, the, empire, for, another, 200, years, after, that, the, british, forces, sacked, various, american, capitals, repeatedly, during, the, revolutionary, war, and, war, of, 1812, but, american, forces, could, still, carry, on, fighting, from, the, countryside, where, they, enjoyed, support, from, local, governments, and, the, traditionally, independent, civilian, frontiersmen, exceptions, to, these, generalizations, include, highly, centralized, states, such, as, france, whose, centralized, bureaucracies, could, effectively, coordinate, far, flung, resources, giving, the, state, a, powerful, advantage, over, less, coherent, rivals, but, risking, utter, ruin, if, the, capital, were, taken
