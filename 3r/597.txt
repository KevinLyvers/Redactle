a, commonly, found, species, of, tree, sterculia, apetala, the, panama, tree, another, states, that, the, first, settlers, arrived, in, panama, in, august, when, butterflies, are, abundant, and, that,

given, in, social, studies, textbooks, the, isthmus, of, panama, was, formed, about, three, million, years, ago, when, the, land, bridge, between, north, and, south, america, finally, became, complete, and, plants, and, animals, gradually, crossed, it, in, both, directions, the, existence, of, the, isthmus, affected, the, dispersal, of, people, agriculture, and, technology, throughout, the, american, continent, from, the, appearance, of, the, first, hunters, and, collectors, to, the, era, of, villages, and, cities, the, earliest, discovered, artifacts, of, indigenous, peoples, in, panama, include, paleo, indian, projectile, points, later, central, panama, was, home, to, some, of, the, first, pottery, making, in, the, americas, for, example, the, cultures, at, monagrillo, which, date, back, to, 2500, 1700, bc, these, evolved, into, significant, populations, best, known, through, their, spectacular, burials, dating, to, c, 500, 900, ad, at, the, monagrillo, archaeological, site, and, their, gran, cocl, style, polychrome, pottery, the, monumental, monolithic, sculptures, at, the, barriles, chiriqui, site, are, also, important, traces, of, these, ancient, isthmian, cultures, before, europeans, arrived, panama, was, widely, settled, by, chibchan, chocoan, and, cueva, peoples, the, largest, group, were, the, cueva, whose, specific, language, affiliation, is, poorly, documented, the, size, of, the, indigenous, population, of, the, isthmus, at, the, time, of, european, colonization, is, uncertain, estimates, range, as, high, as, two, million, people, but, more, recent, studies, place, that, number, closer, to, 200, 000, archaeological, finds, and, testimonials, by, early, european, explorers, describe, diverse, native, isthmian, groups, exhibiting, cultural, variety, and, suggesting, people, developed, by, regular, regional, routes, of, commerce, austronesians, had, a, trade, network, to, panama, as, there, is, evidence, of, coconuts, reaching, the, pacific, coast, of, panama, from, the, philippines, in, precolumbian, times, when, panama, was, colonized, the, indigenous, peoples, fled, into, the, forest, and, nearby, islands, scholars, believe, that, infectious, disease, was, the, primary, cause, of, the, population, decline, of, american, natives, the, indigenous, peoples, had, no, acquired, immunity, to, diseases, such, as, smallpox, which, had, been, chronic, in, eurasian, populations, for, centuries, rodrigo, de, bastidas, sailed, westward, from, venezuela, in, 1501, in, search, of, gold, and, became, the, first, european, to, explore, the, isthmus, of, panama, a, year, later, christopher, columbus, visited, the, isthmus, and, established, a, short, lived, settlement, in, the, province, of, darien, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, s, tortuous, trek, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, in, 1513, demonstrated, that, the, isthmus, was, indeed, the, path, between, the, seas, and, panama, quickly, became, the, crossroads, and, marketplace, of, spain, s, empire, in, the, new, world, king, ferdinand, ii, assigned, pedro, arias, d, vila, as, royal, governor, he, arrived, in, june, 1514, with, a, 19, vessels, and, 1, 500, men, in, 1519, d, vila, founded, panama, city, gold, and, silver, were, brought, by, ship, from, south, america, hauled, across, the, isthmus, and, loaded, aboard, ships, for, spain, the, route, became, known, as, the, camino, real, or, royal, road, although, it, was, more, commonly, known, as, camino, de, cruces, road, of, crosses, because, of, the, number, of, gravesites, along, the, way, at, 1520, the, genoese, controlled, the, port, of, panama, the, genoese, obtained, a, concession, from, the, spanish, to, exploit, the, port, of, panama, mainly, for, the, slave, trade, until, the, destruction, of, the, primeval, city, in, 1671, in, the, meantime, in, 1635, don, sebasti, n, hurtado, de, corcuera, the, then, governor, of, panama, had, recruited, genoese, peruvians, and, panamanians, as, soldiers, to, wage, war, against, muslims, in, the, philippines, and, to, found, the, city, of, zamboanga, panama, was, under, spanish, rule, for, almost, 300, years, 1538, 1821, and, became, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, along, with, all, other, spanish, possessions, in, south, america, from, the, outset, panamanian, identity, was, based, on, a, sense, of, geographic, destiny, and, panamanian, fortunes, fluctuated, with, the, geopolitical, importance, of, the, isthmus, the, colonial, experience, spawned, panamanian, nationalism, and, a, racially, complex, and, highly, stratified, society, the, source, of, internal, conflicts, that, ran, counter, to, the, unifying, force, of, nationalism, in, 1538, the, real, audiencia, of, panama, was, established, initially, with, jurisdiction, from, nicaragua, to, cape, horn, until, the, conquest, of, peru, a, real, audiencia, was, a, judicial, district, that, functioned, as, an, appeals, court, each, audiencia, had, an, oidor, spanish, hearer, a, judge, spanish, authorities, had, little, control, over, much, of, the, territory, of, panama, large, sections, managed, to, resist, conquest, and, missionization, until, very, late, in, the, colonial, era, because, of, this, indigenous, people, of, the, area, were, often, referred, to, as, indios, de, guerra, war, indians, who, resisted, spanish, attempts, to, conquer, them, or, missionize, them, however, panama, was, enormously, important, to, spain, strategically, because, it, was, the, easiest, way, to, transship, silver, mined, in, peru, to, europe, silver, cargoes, were, landed, on, the, west, coast, of, panama, and, then, taken, overland, to, portobello, or, nombre, de, dios, on, the, caribbean, side, of, the, isthmus, for, further, shipment, aside, from, the, european, route, there, was, also, an, asian, american, route, which, led, to, traders, and, adventurers, carrying, silver, from, peru, going, over, land, through, panama, to, reach, acapulco, mexico, before, sailing, to, manila, philippines, using, the, famed, manila, galleons, in, 1579, the, royal, monopoly, that, acapulco, mexico, had, on, trading, with, manila, philippines, was, relaxed, and, panama, was, assigned, as, another, port, that, was, able, to, trade, directly, with, asia, because, of, incomplete, spanish, control, the, panama, route, was, vulnerable, to, attack, from, pirates, mostly, dutch, and, english, and, from, new, world, africans, called, cimarrons, who, had, freed, themselves, from, enslavement, and, lived, in, communes, or, palenques, around, the, camino, real, in, panama, s, interior, and, on, some, of, the, islands, off, panama, s, pacific, coast, one, such, famous, community, amounted, to, a, small, kingdom, under, bayano, which, emerged, in, the, 1552, to, 1558, period, sir, francis, drake, s, famous, raids, on, panama, in, 1572, 73, and, john, oxenham, s, crossing, to, the, pacific, ocean, were, aided, by, panama, cimarrons, and, spanish, authorities, were, only, able, to, bring, them, under, control, by, making, an, alliance, with, them, that, guaranteed, their, freedom, in, exchange, for, military, support, in, 1582, the, following, elements, helped, define, a, distinctive, sense, of, autonomy, and, of, regional, or, national, identity, within, panama, well, before, the, rest, of, the, colonies, the, prosperity, enjoyed, during, the, first, two, centuries, 1540, 1740, while, contributing, to, colonial, growth, the, placing, of, extensive, regional, judicial, authority, real, audiencia, as, part, of, its, jurisdiction, and, the, pivotal, role, it, played, at, the, height, of, the, spanish, empire, the, first, modern, global, empire, the, end, of, the, encomienda, system, in, azuero, however, sparked, the, conquest, of, veraguas, in, that, same, year, under, the, leadership, of, francisco, v, zquez, the, region, of, veraguas, passed, into, castilian, rule, in, 1558, in, the, newly, conquered, region, the, old, system, of, encomienda, was, imposed, on, the, other, hand, the, panamanian, movement, for, independence, can, be, indirectly, attributed, to, the, abolition, of, the, encomienda, system, in, the, azuero, peninsula, set, forth, by, the, spanish, crown, in, 1558, because, of, repeated, protests, by, locals, against, the, mistreatment, of, the, native, population, in, its, stead, a, system, of, medium, and, smaller, sized, landownership, was, promoted, thus, taking, away, the, power, from, the, large, landowners, and, into, the, hands, of, medium, and, small, sized, proprietors, panama, was, the, site, of, the, ill, fated, darien, scheme, which, set, up, a, scottish, colony, in, the, region, in, 1698, this, failed, for, a, number, of, reasons, and, the, ensuing, debt, contributed, to, the, union, of, england, and, scotland, in, 1707, in, 1671, the, privateer, henry, morgan, licensed, by, the, english, government, sacked, and, burned, the, city, of, panama, the, second, most, important, city, in, the, spanish, new, world, at, the, time, in, 1717, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, northern, south, america, was, created, in, response, to, other, europeans, trying, to, take, spanish, territory, in, the, caribbean, region, the, isthmus, of, panama, was, placed, under, its, jurisdiction, however, the, remoteness, of, new, granada, s, capital, santa, fe, de, bogot, the, modern, capital, of, colombia, proved, a, greater, obstacle, than, the, spanish, crown, anticipated, as, the, authority, of, new, granada, was, contested, by, the, seniority, closer, proximity, and, previous, ties, to, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, and, even, by, panama, s, own, initiative, this, uneasy, relationship, between, panama, and, bogot, would, persist, for, centuries, in, 1744, bishop, francisco, javier, de, luna, victoria, decastro, established, the, college, of, san, ignacio, de, loyola, and, on, june, 3, 1749, founded, la, real, y, pontificia, universidad, de, san, javier, by, this, time, however, panama, s, importance, and, influence, had, become, insignificant, as, spain, s, power, dwindled, in, europe, and, advances, in, navigation, technique, increasingly, permitted, ships, to, round, cape, horn, in, order, to, reach, the, pacific, while, the, panama, route, was, short, it, was, also, labor, intensive, and, expensive, because, of, the, loading, and, unloading, and, laden, down, trek, required, to, get, from, the, one, coast, to, the, other, as, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, were, heating, up, all, across, latin, america, panama, city, was, preparing, for, independence, however, their, plans, were, accelerated, by, the, unilateral, grito, de, la, villa, de, los, santos, cry, from, the, town, of, saints, issued, on, november, 10, 1821, by, the, residents, of, azuero, without, backing, from, panama, city, to, declare, their, separation, from, the, spanish, empire, in, both, veraguas, and, the, capital, this, act, was, met, with, disdain, although, on, differing, levels, to, veraguas, it, was, the, ultimate, act, of, treason, while, to, the, capital, it, was, seen, as, inefficient, and, irregular, and, furthermore, forced, them, to, accelerate, their, plans, nevertheless, the, grito, was, a, sign, on, the, part, of, the, residents, of, azuero, of, their, antagonism, toward, the, independence, movement, in, the, capital, those, in, the, capital, region, in, turn, regarded, the, azueran, movement, with, contempt, since, the, separatists, in, panama, city, believed, that, their, counterparts, in, azuero, were, fighting, not, only, for, independence, from, spain, but, also, for, their, right, to, self, rule, apart, from, panama, city, once, the, spaniards, were, gone, it, was, seen, as, a, risky, move, on, the, part, of, azuero, which, lived, in, fear, of, colonel, jos, pedro, antonio, de, f, brega, y, de, las, cuevas, 1774, 1841, the, colonel, was, a, staunch, loyalist, and, had, all, of, the, isthmus, military, supplies, in, his, hands, they, feared, quick, retaliation, and, swift, retribution, against, the, separatists, what, they, had, counted, on, however, was, the, influence, of, the, separatists, in, the, capital, ever, since, october, 1821, when, the, former, governor, general, juan, de, la, cruz, murge, n, left, the, isthmus, on, a, campaign, in, quito, and, left, a, colonel, in, charge, the, separatists, had, been, slowly, converting, f, brega, to, the, separatist, side, so, by, november, 10, f, brega, was, now, a, supporter, of, the, independence, movement, soon, after, the, separatist, declaration, of, los, santos, f, brega, convened, every, organization, in, the, capital, with, separatist, interests, and, formally, declared, the, city, s, support, for, independence, no, military, repercussions, occurred, because, of, skillful, bribing, of, royalist, troops, in, the, 80, years, following, independence, from, spain, panama, was, a, subdivision, of, gran, colombia, after, voluntarily, joining, the, country, at, the, end, of, 1821, it, then, became, part, of, the, republic, of, new, granada, in, 1831, and, was, divided, into, several, provinces, in, 1855, the, autonomous, state, of, panama, was, created, within, the, republic, out, of, the, new, granada, provinces, of, panama, azuero, chiriqu, and, veraguas, it, continued, as, a, state, in, the, granadine, confederation, 1858, 1863, and, united, states, of, colombia, 1863, 1886, the, 1886, constitution, of, the, modern, republic, of, colombia, created, a, new, panama, department, the, people, of, the, isthmus, made, over, 80, attempts, to, secede, from, colombia, they, came, close, to, success, in, 1831, then, again, during, the, thousand, days, war, of, 1899, 1902, understood, among, indigenous, panamanians, as, a, struggle, for, land, rights, under, the, leadership, of, victoriano, lorenzo, the, us, intent, to, influence, the, area, especially, the, panama, canal, s, construction, and, control, led, to, the, separation, of, panama, from, colombia, in, 1903, and, its, establishment, as, a, nation, when, the, senate, of, colombia, rejected, the, hay, herr, n, treaty, on, january, 22, 1903, the, united, states, decided, to, support, and, encourage, the, panamanian, separatist, movement, in, november, 1903, panama, tacitly, supported, by, the, united, states, proclaimed, its, independence, and, concluded, the, hay, bunau, varilla, treaty, with, the, united, states, without, the, presence, of, a, single, panamanian, philippe, bunau, varilla, a, french, engineer, and, lobbyist, represented, panama, even, though, panama, s, president, and, a, delegation, had, arrived, in, new, york, to, negotiate, the, treaty, the, treaty, was, quickly, drafted, and, signed, the, night, before, the, panamanian, delegation, arrived, in, washington, mr, bunau, varilla, was, in, the, employ, of, the, french, canal, company, that, had, failed, and, was, now, bankrupt, the, treaty, granted, rights, to, the, united, states, as, if, it, were, sovereign, in, a, zone, roughly, 16, km, 10, mi, wide, and, 80, km, 50, mi, long, in, that, zone, the, us, would, build, a, canal, then, administer, fortify, and, defend, it, in, perpetuity, in, 1914, the, united, states, completed, the, existing, 83, kilometer, long, 52, mile, canal, because, of, the, strategic, importance, of, the, canal, during, world, war, ii, the, us, extensively, fortified, access, to, it, from, 1903, to, 1968, panama, was, a, constitutional, democracy, dominated, by, a, commercially, oriented, oligarchy, during, the, 1950s, the, panamanian, military, began, to, challenge, the, oligarchy, s, political, hegemony, the, early, 1960s, saw, also, the, beginning, of, sustained, pressure, in, panama, for, the, renegotiation, of, the, hay, bunau, varilla, treaty, including, riots, that, broke, out, in, early, 1964, resulting, in, widespread, looting, and, dozens, of, deaths, and, the, evacuation, of, the, american, embassy, amid, negotiations, for, the, robles, johnson, treaty, panama, held, elections, in, 1968, the, candidates, were, arias,

president, of, panama, promising, to, lead, a, government, of, national, union, that, would, end, the, reigning, corruption, and, pave, the, way, for, a, new, panama, a, week, and, a, half, later, on, october, 11, 1968, the, national, guard, guardia, nacional, ousted, arias, and, initiated, the, downward, spiral, that, would, culminate, with, the, united, states, invasion, in, 1989, arias, who, had, promised, to, respect, the, hierarchy, of, the, national, guard, broke, the, pact, and, started, a, large, restructuring, of, the, guard, to, preserve, the, guard, s, and, his, vested, interests, lieutenant, colonel, omar, torrijos, herrera, and, major, boris, mart, nez, commanded, another, military, coup, against, the, government, the, military, justified, itself, by, declaring, that, arias, madrid, was, trying, to, install, a, dictatorship, and, promised, a, return, to, constitutional, rule, in, the, meantime, the, guard, began, a, series, of, populist, measures, that, would, gain, support, for, the, coup, among, them, were, parallel, to, this, the, military, began, a, policy, of, repression, against, the, opposition, who, were, labeled, communists, the, military, appointed, a, provisional, government, junta, that, was, to, arrange, new, elections, however, the, national, guard, would, prove, to, be, very, reluctant, to, abandon, power, and, soon, began, calling, itself, el,
