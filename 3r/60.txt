is, expected, to, increase, by, 40, by, 2026, as, a, result, 70, 90, of, the, coastal, wetlands, has, been, lost, over, the, past, decades, and, many, remaining, flora, species, are, endangered, on, 3, april, 2010, the, chinese, ship, shen, neng, 1, carrying, 950, tonnes, of, oil, ran, aground, east, of, rockhampton, in, central, queensland, australia, causing, the, 2010, great, barrier, reef, oil, spill, and, inflicting, the, largest, damage, to, the, gbr, and, the, coral, sea, so, far, the, scarred, area, was, roughly, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, long, and, 250, m, 820, ft, wide, and, some, parts, of, it, have, become, completely, devoid, of, marine, life, there, are, concerns, that, there, could, be, considerable, long, term, damage, and, it, will, take, 10, to, 20, years, for, the, reef, to,

marine, reserve, was, proclaimed, in, december, 2013, but, it, was, not, seen, to, offer, enough, protection, for, the, environment, a, group, of, 10, environmental, ngos, came, together, as, a, coalition, called, the, protect, our, coral, sea, campaign, asking, the, government, to, create, a, very, large, highly, protected, coral, sea, marine, park, in, november, 2011, the, australian, government, announced, that, a, 989, 842, square, kilometres, 382, 180, sq, mi, protected, area, was, planned, and, pending, approval, the, coral, sea, commonwealth, marine, reserve, was, renamed, as, the, coral, sea, marine, park, in, october, 2017, it, covers, an, area, of, 989, 836, km, 2, 382, 178, sq, mi, and, is, assigned, iucn, category, iv, with, some, area, assigned, iucn, categories, vi, and, ii, it, is, australia, s, largest, single, marine, park, and, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, protected, areas, the, marine, national, park, protection, iucn, ii, protected, areas, of, the, original, 2012, announcement, were, subsequently, significantly, reduced, from, 50, 78, to, 24, in, the, 2018, management, plan, this, 50, reduction, in, protection, was, enacted, contrary, to, the, recommendations, of, then, commonwealth, government, s, expert, review, panel, before, 2020, only, shallow, parts, of, coral, sea, reefs, had, been, mapped, during, 2020, some, of, the, deepest, parts, of, the, sea, were, mapped, using, an, advanced, multi, beam, sonar, system, aboard, a, research, ship, owned, by, the, schmidt, ocean, institute, after, it, was, diverted, from, a, papua, new, guinea, deployment, because, of, the, pandemic, a, robotic, submarine, sent, back, the, first, ever, high, resolution, footage, and, seafloor, mapping, of, the, vital, marine, protected, area, connecting, the, great, barrier, reef, to, the, pacific, ocean, an, area, of, 35, 554, square, kilometres, 13, 727, sq, mi, was, mapped, during, 14, dives, by, the, submarine, which, went, down, up, to, 1, 600, metres, 5, 200, ft, into, the, depths, and, spent, almost, 100, hours, in, the, sea, geoscientist, jody, webster, of, the, university, of, sydney, marine, geologist, robin, beaman, of, james, cook, university, led, the, expedition, with, colleagues, controlling, the, diving, and, mapping, remotely, rare, marine, life, was, identified, after, the, images, were, shared, with, other, scientists, on, social, media, but, researchers, think, that, some, of, the, species, captured, on, film, could, be, entirely, new, to, science, notable, finds, included, a, species, of, spikefish, called, hollardia, goslinei, previously, only, seen, in, hawaii, and, tosanoides, bennetti, first, described, in, 2019, and, never, seen, alive
