the, formation, of, volcanoes, such, as, the, volcanoes, in, myanmar, and, a, volcanic, arc, called, the, sunda, arc, the, sumatra, andaman, earthquake, and, asian, tsunami, was, a, result, of, the, pressure, at, this, zone, causing, a, submarine, earthquake, which, then, resulted, in, a, destructive, tsunami, a, zone, 50, m, wide, extending, from, the, island, of, sri, lanka, and, the, coromandel, coast, to, the, head, of, the, bay, and, thence, southwards, through, a, strip, embracing, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, is, bounded, by, the, 100, fathom, line, of, sea, bottom,

maximum, thickness, of, 16, 5, km, 10, 3, mi, the, fan, resulted, from, the, uplift, and, erosion, of, the, himalayas, and, the, tibetan, plateau, produced, by, the, collision, between, the, indian, plate, and, the, eurasian, plate, most, of, the, sediment, is, supplied, by, the, ganges, and, brahmaputra, rivers, which, supply, the, lower, meghna, delta, in, bangladesh, and, the, hoogly, delta, in, west, bengal, india, several, other, large, rivers, in, bangladesh, and, india, provide, smaller, contributions, turbidity, currents, have, transported, the, sediment, through, a, series, of, submarine, canyons, some, of, which, are, more, than, 2, 400, kilometres, 1, 500, mi, in, length, to, be, deposited, in, the, bay, of, bengal, up, to, 30, degrees, latitude, from, where, it, began, to, date, the, oldest, sediments, recovered, from, the, bengal, fan, are, from, early, miocene, age, their, mineralogical, and, geochemical, characteristics, allow, to, identify, their, himalayan, origin, and, demonstrate, that, the, himalaya, was, already, a, major, mountain, range, 20, million, years, ago, the, fan, completely, covers, the, floor, of, the, bay, of, bengal, it, is, bordered, to, the, west, by, the, continental, slope, of, eastern, india, to, the, north, by, the, continental, slope, of, bangladesh, and, to, east, by, the, northern, part, of, sunda, trench, off, myanmar, and, the, andaman, islands, the, accretionary, wedge, associated, with, subduction, of, the, indo, australian, plate, beneath, the, sunda, plate, and, continues, along, the, west, side, of, the,

surrounding, developing, nations, the, fan, was, first, identified, by, bathymetric, survey, in, the, sixties, by, bruce, c, heezen, and, marie, tharp, which, identified, the, abyssal, cone, and, canyon, structures, it, was, delineated, and, named, by, joseph, curray, and, david, moore, following, a, geological, and, geophysical, survey, in, 1968, coastal, regions, bordering, the, bay, of, bengal, are, rich, in, minerals, sri, lanka, serendib, or, ratna, dweepa, which, means, gem, island, amethyst, beryl, ruby, sapphire, topaz, and, garnet, are, just, some, of, the, gems, of, sri,

acidification, there, was, reduced, shell, thickness, of, marine, animals, and, breaking, strength, compared, to, normal, shells, the, study, also, showed, that, the, ph, in, bay, of, bengal, fell, to, 7, 75, compared, in, 1994, when, it, averaged, 7, 95, from, january, to, october, the, current, is, northward, flowing, and, the, clockwise, circulation, pattern, is, called, the, east, indian,

by, sundarbans, a, large, estuarine, delta, that, holds, a, mangrove, area, in, the, ganges, river, delta, a, transboundary, issue, is, defined, as, an, environmental, problem, in, which, either, the, cause, of, the, problem, and, or, its, impact, is, separated, by, a, national, boundary, or, the, problem, contributes, to, a, global, environmental, problem, and, finding, regional, solutions, is, considered, to, be, a, global, environmental, benefit, the, eight, bay, of, bengal, countries, have, 2012, identified, three, major, transboundary, problems, or, areas, of, concern, affecting, the, health, of, the, bay, that, they, can, work, on, together, with, the, support, of, the, bay, of, bengal, large, marine, ecosystem, project, boblme, the, eight, countries, are, now, 2012, developing, responses, to, these, issues, and, their, causes, for, future, implementation, as, the, strategic, action, programme, fisheries, production, in, the, bay, of, bengal, is, six, million, tonnes, per, year, more, than, seven, percent, of, the, world, s, catch, the, major, transboundary, issues, relating, to, shared, fisheries, are, a, decline, in, the, overall, availability, of, fish, resources, changes, in, species, composition, of, catches, the, high, proportion, of, juvenile, fish, in, the, catch, and, changes, in, marine, biodiversity, especially, through, loss, of, vulnerable, and, endangered, species, the, transboundary, nature, of, these, issues, are, that, many, fish, stocks, are, shared, between, boblme, countries, through, the, transboundary, migration, of, fish, or, larvae, fishing, overlaps, national, jurisdictions, both, legally, and, illegally, overcapacity, and, overfishing, in, one, location, forces, a, migration, of, fishers, and, vessels, to, other, locations, all, countries, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, are, experiencing, difficulties, in, implementing, fisheries, management, especially, the, ecosystem, approach, to, fisheries, bay, of, bengal, countries, contribute, significantly, to, the, global, problem, of, loss, of, vulnerable, and, endangered, species, the, main, causes, of, the, issues, are, open, access, to, fishing, grounds, government, emphasis, on, increasing, fish, catches, inappropriate, government, subsidies, provided, to, fishers, increasing, fishing, effort, especially, from, trawlers, and, purse, seiners, high, consumer, demand, for, fish, including, for, seed, and, fishmeal, for, aquaculture, ineffective, fisheries, management, and, illegal, and, destructive, fishing, the, bay, of, bengal, is, an, area, of, high, biodiversity, with, many, endangered, and, vulnerable, species, the, major, transboundary, issues, relating, to, habitats, are, the, loss, and, degradation, of, mangrove, habitats, degradation, of, coral, reefs, and, the, loss, of, and, damage, to, seagrasses, the, transboundary, nature, of, these, major, issues, are, that, all, three, critical, habitats, occur, in, all, boblme, countries, coastal, development, for, several, varying, uses, of, the, land, and, sea, are, common, in, all, boblme, countries, trade, in, products, from, all, the, habitats, is, transboundary, in, nature, climate, change, impacts, are, shared, by, all, boblme, countries, the, main, causes, of, the, issues, are, food, security, needs, of, the, coastal, poor, lack, of, coastal, development, plans, increasing, trade, in, products, from, coastal, habitats, coastal, development, and, industrialization, ineffective, marine, protected, areas, and, lack, of, enforcement, upstream, development, that, affects, water, flow, intensive, upstream, agricultural, practices, and, increasing, tourism, the, asian, brown, cloud, a, layer, of, air, pollution, that, covers, much, of, south, asia, and, the, indian, ocean, every, year, between, january, and, march, and, possibly, also, during, earlier, and, later, months, hangs, over, the, bay, of, bengal, it, is, considered, to, be, a, combination, of, vehicle, exhaust, smoke, from, cooking, fires, and, industrial, discharges, because, of, this, cloud, satellites, attempting, to, track, ocean, acidification, and, other, ocean, health, indicators, in, the, bay, have, difficulty, obtaining, accurate, measurements, the, major, transboundary, issues, relating, to, pollution, and, water, quality, are, sewage, borne, pathogens, and, organic, load, solid, waste, marine, litter, increasing, nutrient, inputs, oil, pollution, persistent, organic, pollutants, pops, and, persistent, toxic, substances, ptss, sedimentation, and, heavy, metals, the, transboundary, nature, of, these, issues, are, discharge, of, untreated, partially, treated, sewage, being, a, common, problem, sewage, and, organic, discharges, from, the, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, river, are, likely, to, be, transboundary, plastics, and, derelict, fishing, gear, can, be, transported, long, distances, across, national, boundaries, around, 4, million, tonnes, of, microplastics, are, estimated, to, come, from, india, and, bangladesh, travelling, into, sundurban, and, subsequently, the, bay, of, bengal, high, nutrient, discharges, from, rivers, could, intensify, largescale, hypoxia, atmospheric, transport, of, nutrients, is, inherently, transboundary, differences, between, countries, with, regard, to, regulation, and, enforcement, of, shipping, discharges,
