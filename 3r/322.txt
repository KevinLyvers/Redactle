southeastern, europe, with, various, geographical, and, historical, definitions, the, region, takes, its, name, from, the, balkan, mountains, haemus, mountains, that, stretch, throughout, the, whole, of, bulgaria, the, balkan, peninsula, is, bordered, by, the, adriatic, sea, in, the, northwest, the, ionian, sea, in, the, southwest, the, aegean, sea, in, the, south, the, turkish, straits, in, the, east, and, the, black, sea, in, the, northeast, the, northern, border, of, the, peninsula, is, variously, defined, the, highest, point, of, the, balkans, is, musala, 2, 925, metres, 9, 596, ft, in, the, rila, mountain, range, bulgaria, the, concept, of, the, balkan, peninsula, was, created, by, the, german, geographer, august, zeune, in, 1808, who, mistakenly, considered, the, balkan, mountains, the, dominant, mountain, system, of, southeast, europe, spanning, from, the, adriatic, sea, to, the, black, sea, the, term, balkan, peninsula, was, a, synonym, for, rumelia, in, the, 19th, century, the, parts, of, europe, that, were, provinces, of, the, ottoman, empire, at, the, time, it, had, a, geopolitical, rather, than, a, geographical, definition, which, was, further, promoted, during, the, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, definition, of, the, balkan, peninsula, s, natural, borders, does, not, coincide, with, the, technical, definition, of, a, peninsula, hence, modern, geographers, reject, the, idea, of, a, balkan, peninsula, while, historical, scholars, usually, discuss, the, balkans, as, a, region, the, term, has, acquired, a, stigmatized, and, pejorative, meaning, related, to, the, process, of, balkanization, the, alternative, term, used, for, the, region, is, southeast, europe, the, borders, of, the, balkans, are, due, to, many, contrasting, definitions, disputed, there, exists, no, universal, agreement, on, the, region, s, components, the, term, by, most, definitions, fully, encompasses, albania, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bulgaria, greece, kosovo, montenegro, north, macedonia, european, turkey, the, romanian, coast, most, of, serbia, large, parts, of, croatia, and, southern, parts, of, slovenia, sometimes, the, term, also, includes, romania, as, whole, the, province, of, trieste, in, northeastern, italy, although, by, some, definitions, considered, part, of, the, peninsula, is, generally, excluded, the, origin, of, the, word, balkan, is, obscure, it, may, be, related, to, turkish, b, lk, mud, from, proto, turkic, bal, mud, clay, thick, or, gluey, substance, cf, also, turkic, bal, honey, and, the, turkish, suffix, an, swampy, forest, or, persian, b, l, kh, na, big, high, house, it, was, used, mainly, during, the, time, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, both, ottoman, turkish, and, modern, turkish, balkan, means, chain, of, wooded, mountains, from, classical, antiquity, through, the, middle, ages, the, balkan, mountains, were, called, by, the, local, thracian, name, haemus, according, to, greek, mythology, the, thracian, king, haemus, was, turned, into, a, mountain, by, zeus, as, a, punishment, and, the, mountain, has, remained, with, his, name, a, reverse, name, scheme, has, also, been, suggested, d, dechev, considers, that, haemus, is, derived, from, a, thracian, word, saimon, mountain, ridge, a, third, possibility, is, that, haemus, derives, from, the, greek, word, haima, meaning, blood, the, myth, relates, to, a, fight, between, zeus, and, the, monster, titan, typhon, zeus, injured, typhon, with, a, thunder, bolt, and, typhon, s, blood, fell, on, the, mountains, giving, them, their, name, the, earliest, mention, of, the, name, appears, in, an, early, 14th, century, arab, map, in, which, the, haemus, mountains, are, referred, to, as, balkan, the, first, attested, time, the, name, balkan, was, used, in, the, west, for, the, mountain, range, in, bulgaria, was, in, a, letter, sent, in, 1490, to, pope, innocent, viii, by, buonaccorsi, callimaco, an, italian, humanist, writer, and, diplomat, the, ottomans, first, mention, it, in, a, document, dated, from, 1565, there, has, been, no, other, documented, usage, of, the, word, to, refer, to, the, region, before, that, although, other, turkic, tribes, had, already, settled, in, or, were, passing, through, the, region, there, is, also, a, claim, about, an, earlier, bulgar, turkic, origin, of, the, word, popular, in, bulgaria, however, it, is, only, an, unscholarly, assertion, the, word, was, used, by, the, ottomans, in, rumelia, in, its, general, meaning, of, mountain, as, in, kod, j, a, balkan, atal, balkan, and, ungurus, balkani, but, it, was, especially, applied, to, the, haemus, mountain, the, name, is, still, preserved, in, central, asia, with, the, balkan, daglary, balkan, mountains, and, the, balkan, region, of, turkmenistan, the, english, traveler, john, bacon, sawrey, morritt, introduced, this, term, into, english, literature, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, other, authors, started, applying, the, name, to, the, wider, area, between, the, adriatic, and, the, black, sea, the, concept, of, the, balkans, was, created, by, the, german, geographer, august, zeune, in, 1808, who, mistakenly, considered, it, as, the, dominant, central, mountain, system, of, southeast, europe, spanning, from, the, adriatic, sea, to, the, black, sea, during, the, 1820s, balkan, became, the, preferred, although, not, yet, exclusive, term, alongside, haemus, among, british, travelers, among, russian, travelers, not, so, burdened, by, classical, toponymy, balkan, was, the, preferred, term, in, european, books, printed, until, late, 1800s, it, was, also, known, as, illyrian, peninsula, or, illyrische, halbinsel, in, german, the, term, was, not, commonly, used, in, geographical, literature, until, the, mid, 19th, century, because, already, then, scientists, like, carl, ritter, warned, that, only, the, part, south, of, the, balkan, mountains, could, be, considered, as, a, peninsula, and, considered, it, to, be, renamed, as, greek, peninsula, other, prominent, geographers, who, did, not, agree, with, zeune, were, hermann, wagner, theobald, fischer, marion, newbigin, and, albrecht, penck, while, austrian, diplomat, johann, georg, von, hahn, in, 1869, for, the, same, territory, used, the, term, s, dostereurop, ische, halbinsel, southeasterneuropean, peninsula, another, reason, it, was, not, commonly, accepted, as, the, definition, of, then, european, turkey, had, a, similar, land, extent, however, after, the, congress, of, berlin, 1878, there, was, a, political, need, for, a, new, term, and, gradually, the, balkans, was, revitalized, but, in, the, maps, the, northern, border, was, in, serbia, and, montenegro, without, greece, it, only, depicted, the, ottoman, occupied, parts, of, europe, while, yugoslavian, maps, also, included, croatia, and, bosnia, the, term, balkan, peninsula, was, a, synonym, for, european, turkey, the, political, borders, of, former, ottoman, empire, provinces, the, usage, of, the, term, changed, in, the, very, end, of, the, 19th, and, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, when, it, was, embraced, by, serbian, geographers, most, prominently, by, jovan, cviji, it, was, done, with, political, reasoning, as, affirmation, for, serbian, nationalism, on, the, whole, territory, of, the, south, slavs, and, also, included, anthropological, and, ethnological, studies, of, the, south, slavs, through, which, were, claimed, various, nationalistic, and, racialist, theories, through, such, policies, and, yugoslavian, maps, the, term, was, elevated, to, the, modern, status, of, a, geographical, region, the, term, acquired, political, nationalistic, connotations, far, from, its, initial, geographic, meaning, arising, from, political, changes, from, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, creation, of, post, world, war, i, yugoslavia, initially, the, kingdom, of, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, in, 1918, after, the, dissolution, of, yugoslavia, beginning, in, june, 1991, the, term, balkans, acquired, a, negative, political, meaning, especially, in, croatia, and, slovenia, as, well, in, worldwide, casual, usage, for, war, conflicts, and, fragmentation, of, territory, see, balkanization, in, part, due, to, the, historical, and, political, connotations, of, the, term, balkans, especially, since, the, military, conflicts, of, the, 1990s, in, yugoslavia, in, the, western, half, of, the, region, the, term, southeast, europe, is, becoming, increasingly, popular, a, european, union, initiative, of, 1999, is, called, the, stability, pact, for, southeastern, europe, the, online, newspaper, balkan, times, renamed, itself, southeast, european, times, in, 2003, in, other, languages, of, the, region, the, region, is, known, as, the, balkan, peninsula, is, bounded, by, the, adriatic, sea, to, the, west, the, mediterranean, sea, including, the, ionian, and, aegean, seas, and, the, sea, of, marmara, to, the, south, and, the, black, sea, to, the, east, its, northern, boundary, is, often, given, as, the, danube, sava, and, kupa, rivers, the, balkan, peninsula, has, a, combined, area, of, about, 470, 000, km, 2, 181, 000, sq, mi, slightly, smaller, than, spain, the, peninsula, is, generally, encompassed, in, the, region, known, as, southeast, europe, italy, currently, holds, a, small, area, around, trieste, that, is, by, some, older, definitions, considered, a, part, of, the, balkan, peninsula, however, the, regions, of, trieste, and, istria, are, not, usually, considered, part, of, the, balkans, by, italian, geographers, due, to, their, definition, of, the, balkans, that, limits, its, western, border, to, the, kupa, river, the, borders, of, the, balkans, are, due, to, many, contrasting, definitions, disputed, there, exists, no, universal, agreement, on, the, region, s, components, the, term, by, most, definitions, fully, encompasses, albania, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bulgaria, greece, kosovo, montenegro, north, macedonia, european, turkey, romanian, coast, and, a, large, part, of, croatia, and, serbia, sometimes, the, term, also, includes, romania, as, whole, and, southern, parts, of, slovenia, the, province, of, trieste, in, italy, although, by, some, definitions, on, the, peninsula, is, generally, excluded, from, the, balkans, hungary, and, moldova, are, occasionally, included, in, discussions, of, the, balkans, due, to, cultural, and, historical, affiliation, but, are, largely, excluded, the, term, southeast, europe, is, also, used, for, the, region, with, various, definitions, individual, balkan, states, can, also, be, considered, part, of, other, regions, including, southern, europe, eastern, europe, and, central, europe, turkey, including, its, european, territory, is, generally, included, in, western, asia, or, the, middle, east, the, western, balkans, is, a, political, neologism, coined, to, refer, to, albania, and, the, territory, of, the, former, yugoslavia, except, slovenia, since, the, early, 1990s, the, region, of, the, western, balkans, a, coinage, exclusively, used, in, pan, european, parlance, roughly, corresponds, to, the, dinaric, alps, territory, the, institutions, of, the, european, union, have, generally, used, the, term, western, balkans, to, mean, the, balkan, area, that, includes, countries, that, are, not, members, of, the, european, union, while, others, refer, to, the, geographical, aspects, each, of, these, countries, aims, to, be, part, of, the, future, enlargement, of, the, european, union, and, reach, democracy, and, transmission, scores, but, until, then, they, will, be, strongly, connected, with, the, pre, eu, waiting, program, central, european, free, trade, agreement, croatia, considered, part, of, the, western, balkans, joined, the, eu, in, july, 2013, the, term, is, criticized, for, having, a, geopolitical, rather, than, a, geographical, meaning, and, definition, as, a, multiethnic, and, political, area, in, the, southeastern, part, of, europe, the, geographical, term, of, a, peninsula, defines, that, the, sea, border, must, be, longer, than, the, land, border, with, the, land, side, being, the, shortest, in, the, triangle, but, that, is, not, the, case, for, the, balkan, peninsula, both, the, eastern, and, western, sea, catheti, from, odesa, to, cape, matapan, c, 1230, 1350, km, and, from, trieste, to, cape, matapan, c, 1270, 1285, km, are, shorter, than, the, land, cathetus, from, trieste, to, odesa, c, 1330, 1365, km, the, land, has, too, long, a, land, border, to, qualify, as, a, peninsula, szczecin, 920, km, and, rostock, 950, km, at, the, baltic, sea, are, closer, to, trieste, than, odesa, yet, it, is, not, considered, as, another, european, peninsula, since, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, no, exact, northern, border, has, been, clear, with, an, issue, whether, the, rivers, are, usable, for, its, definition, in, studies, the, balkans, natural, borders, especially, the, northern, border, are, often, avoided, to, be, addressed, considered, as, a, probl, me, fastidieux, delicate, problem, by, andr, blanc, in, g, ographie, des, balkans, 1965, while, john, lampe, and, marvin, jackman, in, balkan, economic, history, 1971, noted, that, modern, geographers, seem, agreed, in, rejecting, the, old, idea, of, a, balkan, peninsula, another, issue, is, the, name, the, balkan, mountains, mostly, in, northern, bulgaria, do, not, dominate, the, region, by, length, and, area, as, do, the, dinaric, alps, an, eventual, balkan, peninsula, can, be, considered, a, territory, south, of, the, balkan, mountains, with, a, possible, name, greek, albanian, peninsula, the, term, influenced, the, meaning, of, southeast, europe, which, again, is, not, properly, defined, by, geographical, factors, yet, historical, borders, of, the, balkans, croatian, geographers, and, academics, are, highly, critical, of, inclusion, of, croatia, within, the, broad, geographical, social, political, and, historical, context, of, the, balkans, while, the, neologism, western, balkans, is, perceived, as, a, humiliation, of, croatia, by, the, european, political, powers, according, to, m, s, alti, the, term, has, two, different, meanings, geographical, ultimately, undefined, and, cultural, extremely, negative, and, recently, strongly, motivated, by, the, contemporary, political, context, in, 2018, president, of, croatia, kolinda, grabar, kitarovi, stated, that, the, use, of, the, term, western, balkans, should, be, avoided, because, it, does, not, imply, only, a, geographic, area, but, also, negative, connotations, and, instead, must, be, perceived, as, and, called, southeast, europe, because, it, is, part, of, europe, slovenian, philosopher, slavoj, i, ek, said, of, the, definition, this, very, alibi, confronts, us, with, the, first, of, many, paradoxes, concerning, balkan, its, geographic, delimitation, was, never, precise, it, is, as, if, one, can, never, receive, a, definitive, answer, to, the, question, where, does, it, begin, for, serbs, it, begins, down, there, in, kosovo, or, bosnia, and, they, defend, the, christian, civilization, against, this, europe, s, other, for, croats, it, begins, with, the, orthodox, despotic, byzantine, serbia, against, which, croatia, defends, the, values, of, democratic, western, civilization, for, slovenes, it, begins, with, croatia, and, we, slovenes, are, the, last, outpost, of, the, peaceful, mitteleuropa, for, italians, and, austrians, it, begins, with, slovenia, where, the, reign, of, the, slavic, hordes, starts, for, germans, austria, itself, on, account, of, its, historic, connections, is, already, tainted, by, balkanic, corruption, and, inefficiency, for, some, arrogant, frenchmen, germany, is, associated, with, the, balkanian, eastern, savagery, up, to, the, extreme, case, of, some, conservative, anti, european, union, englishmen, for, whom, in, an, implicit, way, it, is, ultimately, the, whole, of, continental, europe, itself, that, functions, as, a, kind, of, balkan, turkish, global, empire, with, brussels, as, the, new, constantinople, the, capricious, despotic, center, threatening, english, freedom, and, sovereignty, so, balkan, is, always, the, other, it, lies, somewhere, else, always, a, little, bit, more, to, the, southeast, with, the, paradox, that, when, we, reach, the, very, bottom, of, the, balkan, peninsula, we, again, magically, escape, balkan, greece, is, no, longer, balkan, proper, but, the, cradle, of, our, western, civilization, most, of, the, area, is, covered, by, mountain, ranges, running, from, the, northwest, to, southeast, the, main, ranges, are, the, balkan, mountains, stara,

state, in, the, balkans, in, the, second, century, bc, the, roman, empire, conquered, the, region, and, spread, roman, culture, and, the, latin, language, but, significant, parts, still, remained, under, classical, greek, influence, the, only, paleo, balkan, languages, that, survived, are, albanian, and, greek, the, romans, considered, the, rhodope, mountains, to, be, the, northern, limit, of, the, peninsula, of, haemus, and, the, same, limit, applied, approximately, to, the, border, between, greek, and, latin, use, in, the, region, later, called, the, jire, ek, line, however, large, spaces, south, of, jire, ek, line, were, and, are, inhabited, by, vlachs, aromanians, the, romance, speaking, heirs, of, roman, empire, the, bulgars, and, slavs, arrived, in, the, sixth, century, and, began, assimilating, and, displacing, already, assimilated, through, romanization, and, hellenization, older, inhabitants, of, the, northern, and, central, balkans, this, migration, brought, about, the, formation, of, distinct, ethnic, groups, amongst, the, south, slavs, which, included, the, bulgarians, croats, and, serbs, and, slovenes, prior, to, the, slavic, landing, parts, of, the, western, peninsula, have, been, home, to, the, proto, albanians, including, cities, like, nish, shtip, this, can, be, proven, through, the, development, of, the, names, for, example, naissos, nish, and, astibos, shtip, follow, albanian, phonetic, sound, rules, and, have, entered, slavic, indicating, that, proto, albanian, was, spoken, prior, to, the, slavic, invasion, of, the, balkans, during, the,

half, of, the, 9th, century, when, the, byzantine, missionaries, cyril, and, methodius, managed, to, spread, the, byzantine, variant, of, christianity, to, the, majority, of, the, balkans, inhabitants, who, were, pagan, beforehand, initially, it, was, adopted, by, the, bulgarians, and, serbs, with, the, romanians, joining, a, bit, later, the, albanians, on, the, other, hand, due, to, their, isolation, in, their, mountain, settlements, were, not, immediately, affected, by, the, spread, of, christianity, the, emergence, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, and, the, constant, conflicts, between, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, first, bulgarian, empire, significantly, weakened, the, byzantine, control, over, the, balkans, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, the, byzantines, further, lost, power, in, the, balkans, after, the, resurgence, of, the, bulgarians, in, the, late, 12th, century, with, the, forming, of, their, second, bulgarian, empire, after, the, collapse, of, the, second, bulgarian, empire, the, byzantine, s, empire, grip, on, power, was, prolonged, by, the, inability, of, the, slavs, to, unite, which, was, caused, by, frequent, infighting, amongst, themselves, bulgaria, in, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, was, then, overshadowed, by, the, new, rising, regional, power, of, serbia, which, was, a, result, of, stefan, du, an, rising, up, and, conquering, much, of, the, balkans, to, create, the, serbian, empire, the, serbian, and, byzantine, empires, continued, to, be, the, dominant, forces, in, the, region, until, the, arrival, of, the, ottomans, several, decades, later, ottoman, expansion, in, the, region, began, in, the, second, half, of, the, 14th, century, as, the, byzantine, empire, continued, to, lose, its, grip, on, the, region, after, several, defeats, to, the, ottomans, in, 1362, the, ottoman, turks, conquered, adrianople, now, edirne, turkey, this, was, the, start, of, their, conquest, of, the, balkan, peninsula, which, lasted, for, more, than, a, century, other, states, in, the, area, starting, falling, like, serbia, after, the, battle, of, kosovo, in, 1389, bulgaria, in, 1396, constantinople, in, 1453, bosnia, in, 1463, herzegovina, in, 1482, and, montenegro, in, 1499, the, conquest, was, made, easier, for, the, ottomans, due, to, existing, divisions, among, the, orthodox, peoples, and, by, the, even, deeper, rift, that, had, existed, at, the, time, between, the, eastern, and, western, christians, of, europe, the, albanians, under, skanderbeg, s, leadership, resisted, the, ottomans, for, a, time, 1443, 1468, by, using, guerilla, warfare, skanderbeg, s, achievements, in, particular, the, battle, of, albulena, and, the, first, siege, of, kruj, won, him, fame, across, europe, the, ottomans, eventually, conquered, the, near, entirety, of, the, balkans, and, reached, central, europe, by, the, early, 16th, century, some, smaller, countries, such, as, montenegro, managed, to, retain, some, autonomy, by, managing, their, own, internal, affairs, since, the, territory, was, too, mountainous, to, completely, subdue, another, small, country, that, retained, its, independence, both, de, facto, and, de, jure, in, this, case, was, the, adriatic, trading, hub, of, ragusa, now, dubrovnik, croatia, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, ottoman, empire, had, become, the, controlling, force, in, the, region, after, expanding, from, anatolia, through, thrace, to, the, balkans, many, people, in, the, balkans, place, their, greatest, folk, heroes, in, the, era, of, either, the, onslaught, or, the, retreat, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, examples, for, greeks, constantine, xi, palaiologos, and, kolokotronis, and, for, serbs, milo, obili, tsar, lazar, and,

and, for, croats, nikola, ubi, zrinjski, in, the, past, several, centuries, because, of, the, frequent, ottoman, wars, in, europe, fought, in, and, around, the, balkans, and, the, comparative, ottoman, isolation, from, the, mainstream, of, economic, advance, reflecting, the, shift, of, europe, s, commercial, and, political, centre, of, gravity, towards, the, atlantic, the, balkans, have, been, the, least, developed, part, of, europe, according, to, halil, nalc, k, the, population, of, the, balkans, according, to, one, estimate, fell, from, a, high, of, 8, million, in, the, late, 16th, century, to, only, 3, million, by, the, mid, eighteenth, this, estimate, is, based, on, ottoman, documentary, evidence, most, of, the, balkan, nation, states, emerged, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, as, they, gained, independence, from, the, ottoman, empire, or, the, austro, hungarian, empire, greece, in, 1821, serbia, and, montenegro, in, 1878, romania, in, 1881, bulgaria, in, 1908, and, albania, in, 1912, in, 1912, 1913, the, first, balkan, war, broke, out, when, the, nation, states, of, bulgaria, serbia, greece, and, montenegro, united, in, an, alliance, against, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, result, of, the, war, almost, all, remaining, european, territories, of, the, ottoman, empire, were, captured, and, partitioned, among, the, allies, ensuing, events, also, led, to, the, creation, of, an, independent, albanian, state, bulgaria, insisted, on, its, status, quo, territorial, integrity, divided, and, shared, by, the, great, powers, next, to, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 78, in, other, boundaries, and, on, the, pre, war, bulgarian, serbian, agreement, bulgaria, was, provoked, by, the, backstage, deals, between, its, former, allies, serbia, and, greece, on, the, allocation, of, the, spoils, at, the, end, of, the, first, balkan, war, at, the, time, bulgaria, was, fighting, at, the, main, thracian, front, bulgaria, marks, the, beginning, of, second, balkan, war, when, it, attacked, them, the, serbs, and, the, greeks, repulsed, single, attacks, but, when, the, greek, army, invaded, bulgaria, together, with, an, unprovoked, romanian, intervention, in, the, back, bulgaria, collapsed, the, ottoman, empire, used, the, opportunity, to, recapture, eastern, thrace, establishing, its, new, western, borders, that, still, stand, today, as, part, of, modern, turkey, world, war, i, was, sparked, in, the, balkans, in, 1914, when, members, of, young, bosnia, a, revolutionary, organization, with, predominantly, serb, and, pro, yugoslav, members, assassinated, the, austro, hungarian, heir, archduke, franz, ferdinand, of, austria, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, s, capital, sarajevo, that, caused, a, war, between, austria, hungary, and, serbia, which, through, the, existing, chains, of, alliances, led, to, the, world, war, i, the, ottoman, empire, soon, joined, the, central, powers, becoming, one, of, the, three, empires, participating, in, that, alliance, the, next, year, bulgaria, joined, the, central, powers, attacking, serbia, which, was, successfully, fighting, austro, hungary, to, the, north, for, a, year, that, led, to, serbia, s, defeat, and, the, intervention, of, the, entente, in, the, balkans, which, sent, an, expeditionary, force, to, establish, a, new, front, the, third, one, of, that, war, which, soon, also, became, static, the, participation, of, greece, in, the, war, three, years, later, in, 1918, on, the, part, of, the, entente, finally, altered, the, balance, between, the, opponents, leading, to, the, collapse, of, the, common, german, bulgarian, front, there, which, caused, the, exit, of, bulgaria, from, the, war, and, in, turn, the, collapse, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, ending, the, first, world, war, between, the, two, wars, in, order, to, maintain, the, geopolitical, status, quo, in, the, region, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, balkan, pact, or, balkan, entente, was,

considerable, hardship, due, to, repression, and, starvation, to, which, the, population, reacted, by, creating, a, mass, resistance, movement, together, with, the, early, and, extremely, heavy,
