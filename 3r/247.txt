climate, with, a, wet, season, from, may, to, october, and, a, dry, season, that, runs, from, november, to, april, seasonally, there, is, little, temperature, change, a, major, natural, hazard, is,

there, are, a, large, number, of, generational, caymanians, many, caymanians, today, have, roots, in, almost, every, part, of, the, world, similarly, to, countries, like, the, united, states, the, cayman, islands, is, a, melting, pot, with, citizens, of, every, background, 52, 5, of, the, population, is, non, caymanian, while, 47, 5, is, caymanian, according, to, the, economics, and, statistics, office, of, the, government, of, the, cayman, islands, the, cayman, islands, had, a, population, of, 71, 432, at, the, census, of, 10, october, 2021, but, was, estimated, by, them, to, have, risen, to, 81, 546, as, of, december, 2022, making, it, the, most, populous, british, overseas, territory, it, was, revealed, in, the, 2021, census, that, 56, of, the, workforce, is, non,

has, shown, that, 36, of, cayman, s, population, growth, has, been, in, persons, over, age, 65, while, 8, growth, was, recorded, in, groups, under, age, 15, this, is, due, to, extremely, low, birth, rates, among, caymanians, which, almost, forces, the, government, to, seek, workers, from, overseas, to, sustain, the, country, s, economy, this, has, raised, concerns, among, many, young, caymanians, who, worry, about, the, workforce, becoming, increasingly, competitive, with, the, influx, of, workers, as, well, as, rent, and, property, prices, going, up, because, the, population, has,
