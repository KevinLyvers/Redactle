through, a, broad, flat, plain, until, it, reaches, the, caspian, a, few, kilometers, below, atyrau, where, it, forms, a, fine, digitate, tree, like, delta, the, river, was, called, da, kos, by, ptolemy, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, yulian, kulakovsky, reads, this, as, turkic, jajyk, or, and, on, this, basis, identifies, the, huns, as, turkic, speakers, however, gerard, clauson, disputes, that,

finno, ugric, the, closest, surviving, forms, are, found, joki, finnish, jogi, karelian, j, mansi, ju, komi, river, j, k, khanty, water, also, hypothetically, finno, ugric, titles, may, have, tributaries, of, the, yaik, river, for, example, ilek, erzya, ilyk, strength, and, utva, komi, ytva, spring, water, in, the, 10th, century, work, de, administrando, imperio, byzantine, emperor, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, referred, to, the, ural, river, as, the, geich, the, name, yay, q, is, currently, used, in, the, bashkir, language, and, zhay, q, in, kazakhstan, in, later, european, texts, it, is, sometimes, mentioned, as, rhymnus, fluvius, and, in, the, russian, chronicle, of, 1140, as, yaik, the, river, was, renamed, ural, in, the, russian, language, in, 1775, by, catherine, ii, of, russia, in, the, 10th, to, 16th, centuries, the, city, of, saray, j, k, or, saraichik, meaning, small, sarai, on, the, ural, river, now, in, atyrau, province, of, kazakhstan, was, an, important, trade, center, on, the, silk, road, in, the, 13th, century, it, became, a, stronghold, of, the, golden, horde, it, was, destroyed, in, 1395, by, the, army, of, timur, but, then, rebuilt, to, become, the, capital, of, nogai, horde, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, it, was, finally, reduced, to, a, village, in, 1580, by, the, ural, cossacks, after, the, russian, conquest, of, the, ural, basin, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, shores, of, the, ural, became, home, to, the, yaik, cossacks, one, of, their, main, activities, was, fishing, for, the, sturgeon, and, related, fishes, including, the, true, sturgeon, starry, sturgeon, and, beluga, in, the, ural, river, and, the, caspian, a, great, variety, of, fishing, techniques, existed, the, most, famous, of, them, was, bagrenye, russian, from, bagor, russian, meaning, pike, pole, spearing, hibernating, sturgeons, in, their, underwater, lairs, in, mid, winter, the, bagrenye, was, allowed, only, on, one, day, of, the, year, on, the, appointed, day, a, large, number, of, cossacks, with, pike, poles, were, gathering, on, the, shore, after, a, signal, was, given, they, rushed, on, the, ice, broke, it, with, their, poles, and, speared, and, pulled, the, fish, another, fishing, technique, was, constructing, a, weir, known, as, the, uchug, across, the, river, to, catch, fish, going, upstream, to, spawn, until, 1918, an, uchug, was, set, up, in, the, summer, and, autumn, near, uralsk, so, that, the, fish, would, not, go, upstream, beyond, the, cossacks, land, while, the, uchug, weirs, were, also, known, in, the, volga, delta, the, bagrenye, was, thought, to, be, a, uniquely, ural, technique, the, ural, cossacks, known, originally, as, the, yaik, cossacks, resented, the, attempts, by, the, central, government, to, impose, rules, and, regulations, on, them, and, on, occasions, rose, in, rebellions, the, largest, rebellion, the, pugachev, s, rebellion, of, 1773, 75, involved, not, only, the, ural,

then, falls, into, the, yaik, swamp, and, after, exiting, it, widens, up, to, 5, kilometres, 3, mi, below, verkhneuralsk, its, flow, is, characteristic, of, a, flatland, river, there, it, enters, chelyabinsk, and, orenburg, oblasts, from, magnitogorsk, to, orsk, its, banks, are, steep, and, rocky, and, the, bottom, has, many, rifts, after, orsk, the, river, abruptly, turns, west, and, flows, through, a, 45, kilometre, 28, mi, long, canyon, in, the, guberlinsk, mountains, after, uralsk, it, flows, from, north, to, south, through, the, territory, of, west, kazakhstan, region, and, atyrau, region, of, kazakhstan, there, the, river, widens, and, has, many, lakes, and, ducts, near, the, mouth, it, splits, into, the, yaik, and, zolotoy, distributaries, and, forms, vast, wetlands, the,
