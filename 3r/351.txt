along, the, hindu, kush, was, taken, over, by, western, turks, and, arabs, by, the, eighth, century, facing, wars, with, mostly, iranians, one, major, exception, was, the, period, in, the, mid, to, late, seventh, century, when, the, tang, dynasty, from, china, destroyed, the, northern, turks, and, extended, its, rule, all, the, way, to, the, oxus, river, valley, and, regions, of, central, asia, bordering, all, along, the, hindu, kush, the, subcontinent, and, valleys, of, the, hindu, kush, remained, unconquered, by, the, islamic, armies, until, the, 9th, century, even, though, they, had, conquered, the, southern, regions, of, the, indus, river, valley, such, as, sind, kabul, fell, to, the, army, of, al, ma, mun, the, seventh, abbasid, caliph, in, 808, and, the, local, king, agreed, to, accept, islam, and, pay, annual, tributes, to, the, caliph, however, states, andr, wink, inscriptional, evidence, suggests, that, the, kabul, area, near, hindu, kush, had, an, early, presence, of, islam, when, the, extraction, of, silver, from, the, mines, in, the, hindu, kush, was, at, its, greatest, c, 850, the, value, of, silver, in, relation, to, gold, dropped, and, the, content, of, silver, in, the, carolingian, denarius, was, increased, so, that, it, should, maintain, its, intrinsic, value, the, range, came, under, the, control, of, the, hindu, shahi, dynasty, of, kabul, but, was, conquered, by, sabuktigin, who, took, all, of, jayapala, s, dominion, west, of, peshawar, mahmud, of, ghazni, came, to, power, in, 998, ce, in, ghazna, afghanistan, south, of, kabul, and, the, hindu, kush, range, he, began, a, military, campaign, that, rapidly, brought, both, sides, of, the, hindu, kush, range, under, his, rule, from, his, mountainous, afghani, base, he, systematically, raided, and, plundered, kingdoms, in, north, india, from, east, of, the, indus, river, to, west, of, yamuna, river, seventeen, times, between, 997, and, 1030, mahmud, of, ghazni, raided, the, treasuries, of, kingdoms, sacked, cities, and, destroyed, hindu, temples, with, each, campaign, starting, every, spring, but, he, and, his, army, returned, to, ghazni, and, the, hindu, kush, base, before, monsoons, arrived, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, subcontinent, he, retracted, each, time, only, extending, islamic, rule, into, western, punjab, in, 1017, the, iranian, islamic, historian, al, biruni, was, deported, after, a, war, that, mahmud, of, ghazni, won, to, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, under, mahmud, s, rule, al, biruni, stayed, in, the, region, for, about, fifteen, years, learnt, sanskrit, and, translated, many, indian, texts, and, wrote, about, indian, society, culture, sciences, and, religion, in, persian, and, arabic, he, stayed, for, some, time, in, the, hindu, kush, region, particularly, near, kabul, in, 1019, he, recorded, and, described, a, solar, eclipse, in, what, is, the, modern, era, laghman, province, of, afghanistan, through, which, hindu, kush, pass, al, biruni, also, wrote, about, early, history, of, the, hindu, kush, region, and, kabul, kings, who, ruled, the, region, long, before, he, arrived, but, this, history, is, inconsistent, with, other, records, available, from, that, era, al, biruni, was, supported, by, sultan, mahmud, al, biruni, found, it, difficult, to, get, access, to, indian, literature, locally, in, the, hindu, kush, area, and, to, explain, this, he, wrote, mahmud, utterly, ruined, the, prosperity, of, the, country, and, performed, wonderful, exploits, by, which, the, hindus, became, the, atoms, scattered, in, all, directions, and, like, a, tale, of, old, in, the, mouth, of, the, people, this, is, the, reason, too, why, hindu, sciences, have, retired, far, from, those, parts, of, the, country, conquered, by, us, and, have, fled, to, places, which, our, hand, cannot, yet, reach, to, kashmir, benares, and, other, places, in, the, late, 12th, century, the, historically, influential,

as, with, all, major, ancient, and, medieval, societies, has, been, a, part, of, central, asia, and, south, asia, history, the, hindu, kush, mountain, passes, connected, the, slave, markets, of, central, asia, with, slaves, seized, in, south, asia, the, seizure, and, transportation, of, slaves, from, the, indian, subcontinent, became, intense, in, and, after, the, 8th, century, ce, with, evidence, suggesting, that, the, slave, transport, involved, hundreds, of, thousands, of, slaves, from, india, in, different, periods, of, islamic, rule, era, according, to, john, coatsworth, and, others, the, slave, trading, operations, during, the, pre, akbar, mughal, and, delhi, sultanate, era, sent, thousands, of, hindus, every, year, north, to, central, asia, to, pay, for, horses, and, other, goods, however, the, interaction, between, central, asia, and, south, asia, through, the, hindu, kush, was, not, limited, to, slavery, it, included, trading, in, food, goods, horses, and, weapons, the, practice, of, raiding, tribes, hunting, and, kidnapping, people, for, slave, trading, continued, through, the, 19th, century, at, an, extensive, scale, around, the, hindu, kush, according, to, a, british, anti, slavery, society, report, of, 1874, the, governor, of, faizabad, mir, ghulam, bey, kept, 8, 000, horses, and, cavalrymen, who, routinely, captured, non, muslims, as, well, as, shia, muslims, as, slaves, others, alleged, to, be, involved, in, the, slave, trade, were, feudal, lords, such, as, ameer, sheer, ali, the, isolated, communities, in, the, hindu, kush, were, one, of, the, targets, of, these, slave, hunting, expeditions, the, people, of, kafiristan, practiced, had, ancient, polytheistic, traditions, until, the, 1896, invasion, and, conversion, to, islam, at, the, hands, of, afghans, under, amir, abdur, rahman, khan, british, era, the, hindu, kush, served, as, a, geographical, barrier, to, the, british, empire, leading, to, a, paucity, of, information, and, scarce, direct, interaction, between, the, british, colonial, officials, and, central, asian, peoples, the, british, had, to, rely, on, tribal, chiefs, sadozai, and, barakzai, noblemen, for, information, and, they, generally, downplayed, the, reports, of, slavery, and, other, violence, for, geo, political, strategic, considerations, the, first, british, invasion, of, afghanistan, ended, in, disaster, in, 1842, when, 16, 000, british, soldiers, and, camp, followers, were, massacred, as, they, retreated, through, the, hindu, kush, back, to, india, after, 1947, in, the, colonial, era, the, hindu, kush, was, considered, informally, the, dividing, line, between, russian, and, british, areas, of, influence, in, afghanistan, during, the, cold, war, the, hindu, kush, range, became, a, strategic, theatre, especially, during, the, 1980s, when, soviet, forces, and, their, afghan, allies, fought, the, afghan, mujahideen, channelled, through, pakistan, after, the, soviet, withdrawal, and, the, end, of, the, cold, war, many, mujahideen, morphed, into, taliban, and, al, qaeda, forces, imposing, a, strict, interpretation, of, islamic, law, sharia, with, kabul, these, mountains, and, other, parts, of, afghanistan, as, their, base, other, mujahideen, joined, the, northern, alliance, to, oppose, the, taliban, rule, after, the, 11, september, 2001, terror, attacks, in, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, the, american, and, isaf, campaign, against, al, qaeda, and, their, taliban, allies, made, the, hindu, kush, once, again, a, militarised, conflict, zone, the, 2019, hindu, kush, himalaya, assessment, concluded, that, between, 1901, and, 2014, the, hindu, kush, himalaya, or, hkh, region, had, already, experienced, warming, of, 0, 1, c, per, decade, with, the, warming, rate, accelerating, to, 0, 2, c, per, decade, over, the, past, 50, years, over, the, past, 50, years, the, frequency, of, warm, days, and, nights, had, also, increased, by, 1, 2, days, and, 1, 7, nights, per, decade, while, the, frequency, of, extreme, warm, days, and, nights, had, increased, by, 1, 26, days, and, 2, 54, nights, per, decade, there, was, also, a, corresponding, decline, of, 0, 5, cold, days, 0, 85, extreme, cold, days, 1, cold, night, and, 2, 4, extreme, cold, nights, per, decade, the, length, of, the, growing, season, has, increased, by, 4, 25, days, per, decade, there, is, less, conclusive, evidence, of, light, precipitation, becoming, less, frequent, while, heavy, precipitation, became, both, more, frequent, and, more, intense, finally, since, 1970s, glaciers, have, retreated, everywhere, in, the, region, beside, karakoram, eastern, pamir, and, western, kunlun, where, there, has, been, an, unexpected, increase, in, snowfall, glacier, retreat, had, been, followed, by, an, increase, in, the, number, of, glacial, lakes, some, of, which, may, be, prone, to, dangerous, floods, in, the, future, if, the, paris, agreement, goal, of, 1, 5, c, of, global, warming, is, not, exceeded, warming, in, the, hkh, will, be, at, least, 0, 3, c, higher, and, at, least, 0, 7, c, higher, in, the, hotspots, of, northwest, himalaya, and, karakoram, if, the, paris, agreement, goals, are, broken, then, the, region, is, expected, to, warm, by, 1, 7, 2, 4, c, in, the, near, future, 2036, 2065, and, by, 2, 2, 3, 3, c, 2066, 2095, near, the, end, of, the, century, under, the, intermediate, representative, concentration, pathway, 4, 5, rcp4, 5, under, the, high, warming, rcp8, 5, scenario, where, the, annual, emissions, continue, to, increase, for, the, rest, of, the, century, the, expected, regional, warming, is, 2, 3, 3, 2, c, and, 4, 2, 6, 5, c, respectively, under, all, scenarios, winters, will, warm, more, than, the, summers, and, the, tibetan, plateau, the, central, himalayan, range, and, the, karakoram, will, continue, to, warm, more, than, the, rest, of, the, region, climate, change, will, also, lead, to, the, degradation, of, up, to, 81, of, the, region, s, permafrost, by, the, end, of, the, century, future, precipitation, is, projected, to, increase, as, well, but, cmip5, models, struggle, to, make, specific, projections, due, to, the, region, s, topography, the, most, certain, finding, is, that, the, monsoon, precipitation, in, the, region, will, increase, by, 4, 12, in, the, near, future, and, by, 4, 25, in, the, long, term, there, has, also, been, modelling, of, the, changes, in, snow, cover, but, it, is, limited, to, the, end, of, century, under, the, rcp, 8, 5, scenario, it, projects, declines, of, 30, 50, in, the, indus, basin, 50, 60, in, the, ganges, basin, and, 50, 70, in, the, brahmaputra, basin, as, the, snowline, elevation, in, these, regions, will, rise, by, between, 4, 4, and, 10, 0, m, yr, there, has, been, more, extensive, modelling, of, glacier, trends, it, is, projected, that, one, third, of, all, glaciers, in, the, extended, hkh, region, will, be, lost, by, 2100, even, if, the, warming, is, limited, to, 1, 5, c, with, over, half, of, that, loss, in, the, eastern, himalaya, region, while, rcp, 4, 5, and, rcp, 8, 5, are, likely, to, lead, to, the, losses, of, 50, and, 67, of, the, region, s, glaciers, over, the, same, timeframe, glacier, melt, is, projected, to, accelerate, regional, river, flows, until, the, amount, of, meltwater, peaks, around, 2060, going, into, an, irreversible, decline, afterwards, since, precipitation, will, continue, to, increase, even, as, the, glacier, meltwater, contribution, declines, annual, river, flows, are, only, expected, to, diminish, in, the, western, basins, where, contribution, from, the, monsoon, is, low, however, irrigation, and, hydropower, generation, would, still, have, to, adjust, to, greater, interannual, variability, and, lower, pre, monsoon, flows, in, all, of, the, region, s, rivers, a, range, of, adaptation, efforts, are, already, undertaken, across, the, hkh, region, however, they, suffer, from, underinvestment, and, insufficient, coordination, between, the, various, state, institutional, and, other, non, state, efforts, and, need, to, be, urgently, strengthened, in, order, to, be, commensurate, with, the, challenges, ahead, the, 2019, hindu, kush, himalaya, assessment, outlined, three, main, storylines, for, the, region, between, now, and, 2080, business, as, usual, or, muddling, through, with, no, significant, change, from, the, current, trends, and, development, adaptation, initiatives, proceeding, as, they, do, now, downhill, where, the, intensity, of, global, climate, change, is, high, local, initiatives, fail, and, regional, cooperation, breaks, down, and, prosperous, where, extensive, cooperation, allows, region, s, communities, to, weather, moderate, climate, change, and, increase, their, living, standards, while, also, preserving, the, region, s, biodiversity, in, addition, it, described, two, alternate, pathways, through, which, the, prosperous, future, can, be, achieved, the, first, focuses, on, top, down, large, scale, development, and, the, latter, describes, a, bottom, up, decentralized, alternative, pre, islamic, populations, of, the, hindu, kush, included, shins, yeshkuns, chiliss, neemchas, koli, palus, gaware, and, krammins, 35, n, 71, e, 35, n, 71, e, 35, 71
