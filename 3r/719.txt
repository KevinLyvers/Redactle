each, characterised, by, distinct, political, and, economical, systems, prior, to, the, roman, conquest, a, large, part, of, western, europe, had, adopted, the, newly, developed, la, t, ne, culture, as, the, roman, domain, expanded, a, cultural, and, linguistic, division, appeared, between, the, mainly, greek, speaking, eastern, provinces, which, had, formed, the, highly, urbanised, hellenistic, civilisation, and, the, western, territories, which, in, contrast, largely, adopted, the, latin, language, this, cultural, and, linguistic, division, was, eventually, reinforced, by, the, later,

middle, ages, by, contrast, the, eastern, roman, empire, mostly, known, as, the, greek, or, byzantine, empire, survived, and, even, thrived, for, another, 1000, years, the, rise, of, the, carolingian, empire, in, the, west, and, in, particular, the, great, schism, between, eastern, orthodoxy, and, roman, catholicism, enhanced, the, cultural, and, religious, distinctiveness, between, eastern, and, western, europe, after, the, conquest, of, the, byzantine, empire, center, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, by, the, muslim, ottoman, empire, in, the, 15th, century, and, the, gradual, fragmentation, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, had, replaced, the, carolingian, empire, the, division, between, roman, catholic, and, protestant, became, more, important, in, europe, than, that,
