lake, balkhash, also, spelt, lake, balqash, kazakh, balqa, k, l, pronounced, is, a, lake, in, southeastern, kazakhstan, one, of, the, largest, lakes, in, asia, and, the, 15th, largest, in, the, world, it, is, located, in, the, eastern, part, of, central, asia, and, sits, in, the, balkhash, alakol, basin, an, endorheic, closed, basin, the, basin, drains, seven, rivers, the, primary, of, which, is, the, ili, bringing, most, of, the, riparian, inflow, others, such, as, the, karatal, bring, surface, and, subsurface, flow, the, ili, is, fed, by, precipitation, largely, vernal, snowmelt, from, the, mountains, of, china, s, xinjiang, region, the, lake, currently, covers, about, 16, 400, km, 2, 6, 300, sq, mi, however, like, the, aral, sea, it, is, shrinking, due, to, diversion, and, extraction, of, water, from, its, feeders, the, lake, has, a, narrow, quite, central, strait, the, lake, s, western, part, is, fresh, water, and, its, eastern, half, is, saline, the, eastern, part, is, on, average, 1, 7, times, deeper, than, the, west, the, largest, shore, city, is, named, balkhash, and, has, about, 66, 000, inhabitants, main, local, economic, activities, include, mining, ore, processing, and, fishing, there, is, concern, about, the, lake, s, shallowing, due, to, desertification, of, microclimates, and, water, extraction, for, multiplied, industrial, output, moreover, the, impacts, of, climate, change, may, also, negatively, affect, the, lake, and, its, ecosystems, the, present, name, of, the, lake, originates, from, the, word, balkas, of, tatar, kazakh, and, southern, altai, languages, which, means, tussocks, in, a, swamp, from, as, early, as, 103, bc, up, until, the, 8th, century, the, balkhash, polity, surrounding, the, lake, whose, chinese, name, was, yibohai, was, known, to, the, chinese, as, bugu, buku, busu, from, the, 8th, century, on, the, land, to, the, south, of, the, lake, between, it, and, the, tian, shan, mountains, was, known, in, turkic, as, jetisu, seven, rivers, semirechye, in, russian, it, was, a, land, where, the, nomadic, turks, and, mongols, of, the, steppe, mingled, cultures, with, the, settled, peoples, of, central, asia, in, 1864, the, lake, and, its, neighboring, area, were, ceded, to, the, russian, empire, under, the, treaty, of, tarbagatai, with, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, lake, became, part, of, kazakhstan, balkhash, lies, in, the, deepest, part, of, the, vast, balkhash, alakol, depression, which, was, formed, by, a, sloping, trough, between, mountains, of, the, alpine, orogeny, and, the, older, kazakhstan, block, during, the, neogene, and, quaternary, rapid, erosion, of, the, tian, shan, has, meant, the, depression, subsequently, filled, with, sand, river, sediments, in, what, is, geologically, a, very, short, time, span, the, basin, is, a, part, of, dzungarian, alatau, which, also, contains, lakes, sasykkol, alakol, and, aibi, these, lakes, are, remnants, of, an, ancient, sea, which, once, covered, the, entire, balkhash, alakol, depression, but, was, not, connected, with, the, aral, caspian, depression, all, the, rivers, of, this, region, that, carry, their, waters, from, high, mountains, flow, into, lake, balkhash, however, none, of, them, flows, out, the, major, ones, are, ili, aksu, and, karatal, river, tokrau, flows, from, the, north, but, its, waters, get, lost, in, the, sands, before, reaching, the, lakeshore, the, lake, is, divided, into, two, parts, by, the, saryesik, peninsula, which, means, yellow, door, in, the, kazakh, language, these, two, parts, are, connected, by, the, uzynaral, strait, in, ancient, times, balkhash, was, much, larger, and, many, lakes, in, the, area, were, part, of, it, such, as, zhalanashkol, itishpes, alakol, and, sasykkol, even, farther, back, it, was, a, sea, stretching, all, the, way, to, the, dzungarian, alatau, as, recently, as, 1910, the, lake, was, considerably, larger, with, an, estimated, area, of, 23, 464, km, 2, by, 1946, this, had, shrunk, to, 15, 730, km, 2, the, lake, covers, about, 16, 400, km, 2, 2000, making, it, the, largest, lake, wholly, in, kazakhstan, its, surface, is, about, 340, m, above, sea, level, it, has, a, gentle, curve, sickle, shape, yet, with, jagged, shorelines, its, length, is, about, 600, km, and, the, width, varies, from, 9, 19, km, in, the, eastern, part, to, 74, km, in, the, western, part, saryesik, peninsula, near, the, middle, of, the, lake, hydrographically, divides, it, into, two, very, different, lakes, the, western, lake, covers, 58, of, the, surface, area, but, only, 46, of, the, volume, it, is, thus, relatively, shallow, quiet, and, filled, with, freshwater, the, eastern, lake, is, much, deeper, and, saltier, these, parts, are, connected, by, the, uzynaral, strait, kazakh, long, island, 3, 5, km, wide, and, about, 6, metres, deep, the, lake, includes, several, small, basins, in, the, western, part, are, two, depressions, 7, 11, meters, deep, one, extends, from, the, western, coast, near, tasaral, island, to, cape, korzhyntubek, whereas, the, second, lies, south, from, the, gulf, bertys, which, is, the, deepest, part, of, the, half, the, average, depth, of, the, eastern, basin, is, 16, m, and, has, the, maximum, depth, of, 26, m, the, average, depth, of, the, lake, is, 5, 8, metres, and, the, total, volume, of, water, is, about, 112, km, 3, the, western, and, northern, shores, of, the, lake, are, high, 20, 30, m, and, rocky, they, are, composed, of, such, paleozoic, rocks, as, porphyry, tuff, granite, schist, and, limestone, and, keep, traces, of, ancient, terraces, the, southern, shores, near, the, gulf, karashagan, and, ili, river, are, low, 1, 2, m, and, sandy, they, are, often, flooded, and, therefore, contain, numerous, water, pools, occasional, hills, are, present, with, the, height, of, 5, 10, m, the, coastline, is, very, curvy, and, dissected, by, numerous, bays, and, coves, the, large, bays, of, the, western, part, are, saryshagan, kashkanteniz, karakamys, shempek, the, southern, pole, of, the, lake, and, balakashkan, ahmetsu, and, those, in, the, eastern, part, are, guzkol, balyktykol, kukuna, karashigan, the, eastern, part, also, includes, peninsulas, baygabyl, balay, shaukar, kentubek, and, korzhintobe, the, lake, contains, 43, islands, with, a, total, area, of, 66, km, 2, however, new, islands, are, being, formed, due, to, the, lowering, of, water, level, and, the, area, of, the, existing, ones, is, increasing, the, islands, of, the, western, part, include, tasaral, and, basaral, the, largest, as, well, as, ortaaral, ayakaral, and, olzhabekaral, the, eastern, islands, include, ozynaral, ultarakty, korzhyn, and, algazy, the, balkhash, alakol, basin, covers, 512, 000, km, 2, and, its, average, surface, water, runoff, is, 27, 76, km, 3, year, of, which, 11, 5, km, 3, comes, from, china, the, drainage, basin, of, the, lake, is, about, 413, 000, km, 2, with, 15, in, the, north, west, of, xinjiang, in, china, and, a, negligible, part, from, mountains, along, the, kyrgyz, kazakh, border, lake, balkhash, thus, takes, 86, of, water, inflow, from, balkhash, alakol, basin, the, ili, accounts, for, 73, 80, of, the, inflow, 12, 3, km, 3, year, or, 23, km, 3, per, year, the, river, rises, in, a, very, long, narrow, high, sided, valley, lined, by, the, tian, shan, mountains, and, is, mainly, fed, by, glacier, these, have, a, sporadic, degree, of, relief, precipitation, their, predominant, type, inflow, is, often, greatest, and, most, regulated, during, the, glacial, melting, season, june, to, july, the, river, forms, a, quite, narrow, delta, of, 8, 000, km, 2, that, serves, as, an, multi, year, accumulator, type, of, regulator, the, eastern, part, of, the, lake, is, fed, by, the, rivers, karatal, aksu, and, lepsy, as, well, as, by, groundwater, the, karatal, rises, on, the, slopes, of, dzungarian, alatau, and, is, the, second, largest, inflow, the, ayaguz, which, fed, the, east, half, until, 1950, seldom, reaches, lake, balkhash, the, western, half, s, inflow, averages, 1, 15, km, 3, greater, per, year, the, area, and, volume, vary, due, to, long, term, and, short, term, fluctuations, in, water, level, long, term, fluctuations, had, an, amplitude, of, 12, 14, metres, since, the, year, 0, ce, they, saw, minimal, water, between, the, 5th, and, 10th, centuries, and, maximal, between, the, 13th, and, 18th, centuries, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, between, 1958, and, 1969, lake, swelled, to, cover, about, 18, 000, km, 2, in, droughts, such, as, the, late, 1900s, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, lake, shrank, to, about, 16, 000, km, 2, having, a, drop, in, level, of, about, 3, metres, in, 1946, the, area, was, 15, 730, km, 2, volume, 82, 7, km, 3, from, the, late, 1900s, the, lake, is, shrinking, due, to, the, diversion, of, the, rivers, supplying, it, for, example, kapshagay, hydroelectric, power, plant, was, built, on, ili, in, 1970, filling, the, associated, kapshagay, reservoir, disbalanced, the, lake, worsening, water, quality, especially, in, the, eastern, part, between, 1970, and, 1987, the, water, level, fell, by, 2, 2, metres, the, volume, reduced, by, 30, km, 3, salinity, in, the, west, half, was, increasing, projects, were, proposed, to, slow, the, changes, down, such, as, by, splitting, the, lake, in, two, with, a, dam, called, off, as, the, soviet, union, saw, recession, democratisation, and, secession, total, losses, amounted, to, 24, 58, km, 3, including, the, minimal, water, level, of, recent, decades, 340, 65, meters, aod, was, in, 1987, when, the, filling, kapshagay, reservoir, was, completed, the, level, recovered, to, 342, 5, m, by, january, 2005, attributed, to, exceptional, precipitation, in, the, late, 1990s, balkhash, is, a, semi, saline, lake, chemical, composition, strongly, depends, on, the, hydrographic, features, of, the, reservoir, water, in, the, west, half, is, nearly, fresh, with, the, content, of, total, dissolved, solids, about, 0, 74, g, l, and, cloudy, visibility, 1, metre, it, is, used, for, drinking, and, industry, the, east, half, has, less, silt, in, suspension, visibility, 5, 5, metres, but, resembles, oceanic, sea, water, in, salinity, with, concentration, of, 3, 5, 6, g, l, the, average, salinity, of, the, lake, is, 2, 94, g, l, long, term, 1931, 70, average, precipitation, of, salts, in, the, lake, is, 7, 53, million, tonnes, and, the, reserves, of, dissolved, salts, are, about, 312, million, tonnes, the, water, in, the, western, part, has, a, yellow, gray, tint, and, in, the, eastern, part, the, color, varies, from, bluish, to, emerald, blue, the, climate, of, the, lake, area, is, continental, the, average, mean, temperature, is, about, 24, c, with, 30, c, 86, f, highs, in, july, and, the, average, mean, temperature, is, 14, c, in, january, average, precipitation, is, 131, mm, per, year, and, the, relative, humidity, is,

8, m, s, and, blows, mainly, southward, in, the, western, part, and, to, the, south, west, in, the, eastern, part, the, wind, induces, waves, up, to, 2, 3, 5, m, in, height, and, steady, clockwise, currents, in, the, western, part, there, are, 110, 130, sunny, days, per, year, with, the, average, irradiance, of, 15, 9, mj, m, 2, per, day, water, temperature, at, the, surface, of, the, lake, varies, from, 0, c, in, december, to, 28, c, in, july, the, average, annual, temperature, is, 10, c, in, the, western, and, 9, c, in, the, eastern, parts, of, the, lake, the, lake, freezes, every, year, between, november, and, early, april, and, the, melting, is, delayed, by, some, 10, 15, days, in, the, eastern, part, the, shores, of, the, lake, contain, individual, willow, trees, and, riparian, forests, mostly, composed, of, various, species, of, populus, plants, include, common, reed, phragmites, australis, lesser, indian, reed, mace, typha, angustata, and, several, species, of, cane, schoenoplectus, littoralis, s, lacustris, and, endemic, s, kasachstanicus, under, water, grow, two, types, of, myriophyllum, spiked, m, spicatum, and, whorled, m, verticillatum, several, kinds,

was, focused, on, carp, perch, asp, leuciscus, aspius, and, bream, abundant, and, dense, reeds, in, the, southern, part, of, the, lake, especially, in, the, delta, of, the, ili, river, served, as, a, haven, for, birds, and, animals, changes, in, the, water, level, led, to, the, degradation, of, the, delta, since, 1970, its, area, decreased, from, 3, 046, to, 1, 876, km, 2, reducing, wetlands, and, riparian, forests, which, were, inhabited, by, birds, and, animals, land, development, application, of, pesticides, overgrazing, and, deforestation, also, contributed, to, the, decrease, in, biodiversity, of, the, 342, species, of, vertebrates, 22, are, endangered, and, are, listed, in, the, red, book, of, kazakhstan, forests, of, the, ili, delta, were, inhabited, by, the, rare, now, probably, extinct, caspian, tiger, and, its, prey, wild, boar, around, the, 1940s, canadian, muskrat, was, brought, to, the, ili, delta, it, quickly, acclimatized, feeding, on, typha, and, was, trapped, for, fur, up, to, 1, million, animals, per, year, however, recent, changes, in, the, water, level, destroyed, its, habitat, bringing, the, fur, industry, to, a, halt, balkhash, is, also, the, habitat, of, 120, types, of, bird, including, cormorants, marbled, teal, pheasants, golden, eagle, and, great, egret, 12, of, those, are, endangered, including, great, white, pelican, dalmatian, pelican, eurasian, spoonbill, whooper, swan, and, white, tailed, eagle, in, 2005, 3, 3, million, people, lived, in, the, basin, of, the, lake, balkhash, including, residents, of, almaty, the, largest, city, of, kazakhstan, the, largest, city, on, the, lake, is, balkhash, with, 66, 724, inhabitants, 2010, it, is, on, the, northern, shore, and, has, a, prominent, mining, and, metallurgy, plant, a, large, copper, deposit, was, discovered, in, the, area, in, 1928, 1930, and, is, being, developed, in, the, villages, north, of, the, lake, part, of, the, motorway, between, bishkek, and, karaganda, runs, along, the, western, shore, of, the, lake, the, western, shore, also, hosts, military, installations, built, during, the, soviet, era, such, as, radar, missile, warning, systems, the, southern, shore, is, almost, unpopulated, and, has, only, a, few, villages, the, nature, and, wild, life, of, the, lake, attract, tourists, and, there, are, several, resorts, on, the, lake, in, 2021, lake, balkhash, was, selected, as, one, of, the, top, 10, tourist, destinations, in, the, country, of, kazakhstan, the, economic, importance, of, the, lake, is, mostly, in, its, fishing, industry, systematic, breeding, of, fish, began, in, 1930, the, annual, catch, was, 20, thousand, tonnes, in, 1952, it, increased, to, 30, thousands, in, the, 1960s, and, included, up, to, 70, of, valuable, species, however, by, the, 1990s, production, fell, to, 6, 600, tonnes, per, year, with, only, 49, tonnes, of, valuable, breeds, the, decline, is, attributed, to, several, factors, including, the, halt, of, reproduction, programs, poaching, and, decline, in, water, level, and, quality, in, 1970, the, 364, megawatt, kapshagay, hydroelectric, power, plant, was, built, on, the, ili, river, drawing, water, out, of, the, new, kapshagay, reservoir, for, irrigation, ili, s, water, is, also, extensively, used, upstream, in, the, xinjiang, province, of, china, for, the, cultivation, of, cotton, currently, there, is, a, project, for, an, additional, counter, regulatory, dam, 23, km, downstream, from, the, kapchagay, the, associated, 49, 5, mw, kerbulak, hydroelectric, power, plant, will, partially, solve, the, problem, of, providing, electricity, to, the, southern, areas, of, kazakhstan, and, will, serve, as, a, buffer, for, daily, and, weekly, fluctuations, in, the, water, level, of, the, ili, river, energy, supply, to, the, south, eastern, part, of, kazakhstan, is, an, old, problem, with, numerous, solutions, proposed, in, the, past, proposals, to, build, power, plants, on, balkhash, in, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, stalled, and, the, initiative, to, erect, a, nuclear, plant, near, the, village, ulken, met, strong, opposition, from, environmentalists, and, residents, therefore, in, 2008, the, kazakh, government, reconsidered, and, announced, building, of, a, balkhash, thermal, power, plant, there, is, a, regular, ship, navigation, through, the, lake, the, mouth, of, the, ili, river, and, the, kapchagay, reservoir, the, main, piers, are, burylbaytal, and, burlitobe, the, ships, are, relatively, light, due, to, the, limiting, depth, in, some, parts, of, the, lake, they, are, used, mainly, for, catching, fish, and, transporting, fish, and, construction, materials, the, total, length, of, the, waterway, is, 978, km, and, the, navigation, period, is, 210, days, year, navigation, on, the, lake, balkhash, originated, in, 1931, with, the, arrival, of, two, steamers, and, three, barges, by, 1996, up, to, 120, 000, tonnes, of, building, materials, 3, 500, tonnes, of, ore, 45, tonnes, of, fish, 20, tonnes, of, melons, and, 3, 500, passengers, were, transported, on, balkhash, per, year, during, 2004, there, were, 1000, passengers, and, 43, tonnes, of, fish, in, 2004, the, local, fleets, consisted, of, 87, vessels, including, 7, passenger, ships, 14, cargo, barges, and, 15, tugboats, the, government, projected, that, 2012, would, see, in, the, ili, balkhash, basin, 233, 000, tonnes, of, construction, materials, at, least, 550, 000, tonnes, of, livestock, fertiliser, and, foodstuffs, and, at, least, 53, tonnes, of, fish, development, of, eco, tourism, is, expected, to, increase, the, passengers, to, 6, 000, people, per, year, academics, and, government, advisors, fear, major, loss, of, ecosystems, in, the, lake, unabashed, industrial, extraction, would, likely, emulate, the, environmental, disaster, at, the, aral, sea, since, 1970, the, 39, km, 3, outflow, of, water, to, fill, the, kapchagay, reservoir, led, to, a, 66, fall, in, inflow, from, the, ili, the, concomitant, decrease, the, lake, s, level, was, about, 15, 6, cm, year, much, greater, than, the, natural, decline, of, 1908, 1946, 9, 2, cm, year, the, shallowing, is, acute, in, the, western, half, from, 1972, until, 2001, a, small, salt, lake, alakol, 8, km, south, of, balkhash, had, practically, disappeared, and, the, southern, part, of, the, lake, lost, about, 150, km, 2, of, water, surface, of, the, 16, existing, lake, systems, around, the, lake, only, five, remain, the, desertification, process, involved, about, 1, 3, of, the, basin, salt, dust, is, blown, away, from, the, dried, areas, contributing, to, the, generation, of, asian, dust, storms, increase, the, soil, salinity, and, adversely, influencing, the, climate, increasing, formation, of, silt, in, the, river, s, delta, further, reduces, the, inflow, of, water, to, the, lake, another, factor, affecting, the, ecology, of, the, ili, balkhash, basin, is, emissions, due, to, mining, and, metallurgical, processes, mostly, at, the, balkhash, mining, and, metallurgy, plant, operated, by, kazakhmys, in, the, early, 1990s, the, emission, level, was, 280, 320, thousand, tonnes, per, year, depositing, 76, tonnes, of, copper, 68, tonnes, of, zinc, and, 66, tonnes, of, lead, on, the, surface, of, the, lake, since, then, emissions, have, almost, doubled, contaminants, are, also, brought, from, the, dump, sites, by, the, dust, storms, in, 2000, a, major, conference, balkhash, 2000, brought, together, environmental, scientists, from, different, countries, as, well, as, representatives, of, business, and, government, the, conference, adopted, a, resolution, and, appeal, to, the, government, of, kazakhstan, and, international, organizations, suggesting, new, ways, of, managing, the, ecosystems, of, alakol, and, balkhash, basins, at, the, 2005, international, environmental, forum, devoted, to, lake, balkhash, kazakhmys, announced, that, by, 2006, it, will, restructure, its, processes, thereby, reducing, emissions, by, 80, 90, contamination, of, balkhash, originates, not, only, locally, but, is, also, brought, by, inflow, of, polluted, water, from, china, china, also, consumes, 14, 5, km, 3, of, water, per, year, from, the, ili, river, with, a, planned, increase, of, 3, 6, times, that, the, current, rate, of, the, increase, is, 0, 5, 4, km, 3, year, in, 2007, the, kazakhstan, government, proposed, a, price, reduction, for, sales, of, kazakh, products, to, china, in, exchange, for, reduction, of, water, consumption, from, ili, river, but, the, offer, was, declined, by, china
