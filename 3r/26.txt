remote, sensing, is, the, acquisition, of, information, about, an, object, or, phenomenon, without, making, physical, contact, with, the, object, in, contrast, to, in, situ, or, on, site, observation, the, term, is, applied, especially, to, acquiring, information, about, earth, and, other, planets, remote, sensing, is, used, in, numerous, fields, including, geophysics, geography, land, surveying, and, most, earth, science, disciplines, e, g, exploration, geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology, it, also, has, military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and, humanitarian, applications, among, others, in, current, usage, the, term, remote, sensing, generally, refers, to, the, use, of, satellite, or, aircraft, based, sensor, technologies, to, detect, and, classify, objects, on, earth, it, includes, the, surface, and, the, atmosphere, and, oceans, based, on, propagated, signals, e, g, electromagnetic, radiation, it, may, be, split, into, active, remote, sensing, when, a, signal, is, emitted, by, a, satellite, or, aircraft, to, the, object, and, its, reflection, is, detected, by, the, sensor, and, passive, remote, sensing, when, the, reflection, of, sunlight, is, detected, by, the, sensor, remote, sensing, can, be, divided, into, two, types, of, methods, passive, remote, sensing, and, active, remote, sensing, passive, sensors, gather, radiation, that, is, emitted, or, reflected, by, the, object, or, surrounding, areas, reflected, sunlight, is, the, most, common, source, of, radiation, measured, by, passive, sensors, examples, of, passive, remote, sensors, include, film, photography, infrared, charge, coupled, devices, and, radiometers, active, collection, on, the, other, hand, emits, energy, in, order, to, scan, objects, and, areas, whereupon, a, sensor, then, detects, and, measures, the, radiation, that, is, reflected, or, backscattered, from, the, target, radar, and, lidar, are, examples, of, active, remote, sensing, where, the, time, delay, between, emission, and, return, is, measured, establishing, the, location, speed, and, direction, of, an, object, remote, sensing, makes, it, possible, to, collect, data, of, dangerous, or, inaccessible, areas, remote, sensing, applications, include, monitoring, deforestation, in, areas, such, as, the, amazon, basin, glacial, features, in, arctic, and, antarctic, regions, and, depth, sounding, of, coastal, and, ocean, depths, military, collection, during, the, cold, war, made, use, of, stand, off, collection, of, data, about, dangerous, border, areas, remote, sensing, also, replaces, costly, and, slow, data, collection, on, the, ground, ensuring, in, the, process, that, areas, or, objects, are, not, disturbed, orbital, platforms, collect, and, transmit, data, from, different, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, which, in, conjunction, with, larger, scale, aerial, or, ground, based, sensing, and, analysis, provides, researchers, with, enough, information, to, monitor, trends, such, as, el, ni, o, and, other, natural, long, and, short, term, phenomena, other, uses, include, different, areas, of, the, earth, sciences, such, as, natural, resource, management, agricultural, fields, such, as, land, usage, and, conservation, greenhouse, gas, monitoring, oil, spill, detection, and, monitoring, and, national, security, and, overhead, ground, based, and, stand, off, collection, on, border, areas, the, basis, for, multispectral, collection, and, analysis, is, that, of, examined, areas, or, objects, that, reflect, or, emit, radiation, that, stand, out, from, surrounding, areas, for, a, summary, of, major, remote, sensing, satellite, systems, see, the, overview, table, to, coordinate, a, series, of, large, scale, observations, most, sensing, systems, depend, on, the, following, platform, location, and, the, orientation, of, the, sensor, high, end, instruments, now, often, use, positional, information, from, satellite, navigation, systems, the, rotation, and, orientation, are, often, provided, within, a, degree, or, two, with, electronic, compasses, compasses, can, measure, not, just, azimuth, i, e, degrees, to, magnetic, north, but, also, altitude, degrees, above, the, horizon, since, the, magnetic, field, curves, into, the, earth, at, different, angles, at, different, latitudes, more, exact, orientations, require, gyroscopic, aided, orientation, periodically, realigned, by, different, methods, including, navigation, from, stars, or, known, benchmarks, the, quality, of, remote, sensing, data, consists, of, its, spatial, spectral, radiometric, and, temporal, resolutions, in, order, to, create, sensor, based, maps, most, remote, sensing, systems, expect, to, extrapolate, sensor, data, in, relation, to, a, reference, point, including, distances, between, known, points, on, the, ground, this, depends, on, the, type, of, sensor, used, for, example, in, conventional, photographs, distances, are, accurate, in, the, center, of, the, image, with, the, distortion, of, measurements, increasing, the, farther, you, get, from, the, center, another, factor, is, that, of, the, platen, against, which, the, film, is, pressed, can, cause, severe, errors, when, photographs, are, used, to, measure, ground, distances, the, step, in, which, this, problem, is, resolved, is, called, georeferencing, and, involves, computer, aided, matching, of, points, in, the, image, typically, 30, or, more, points, per, image, which, is, extrapolated, with, the, use, of, an, established, benchmark, warping, the, image, to, produce, accurate, spatial, data, as, of, the, early, 1990s, most, satellite, images, are, sold, fully, georeferenced, in, addition, images, may, need, to, be, radiometrically, and, atmospherically, corrected, interpretation, is, the, critical, process, of, making, sense, of, the, data, the, first, application, was, that, of, aerial, photographic, collection, which, used, the, following, process, spatial, measurement, through, the, use, of, a, light, table, in, both, conventional, single, or, stereographic, coverage, added, skills, such, as, the, use, of, photogrammetry, the, use, of, photomosaics, repeat, coverage, making, use, of, objects, known, dimensions, in, order, to, detect, modifications, image, analysis, is, the, recently, developed, automated, computer, aided, application, that, is, in, increasing, use, object, based, image, analysis, obia, is, a, sub, discipline, of, giscience, devoted, to, partitioning, remote, sensing, rs, imagery, into, meaningful, image, objects, and, assessing, their, characteristics, through, spatial, spectral, and, temporal, scale, old, data, from, remote, sensing, is, often, valuable, because, it, may, provide, the, only, long, term, data, for, a, large, extent, of, geography, at, the, same, time, the, data, is, often, complex, to, interpret, and, bulky, to, store, modern, systems, tend, to, store, the, data, digitally, often, with, lossless, compression, the, difficulty, with, this, approach, is, that, the, data, is, fragile, the, format, may, be, archaic, and, the, data, may, be, easy, to, falsify, one, of, the, best, systems, for, archiving, data, series, is, as, computer, generated, machine, readable, ultrafiche, usually, in, typefonts, such, as, ocr, b, or, as, digitized, half, tone, images, ultrafiches, survive, well, in, standard, libraries, with, lifetimes, of, several, centuries, they, can, be, created, copied, filed, and, retrieved, by, automated, systems, they, are, about, as, compact, as, archival, magnetic, media, and, yet, can, be, read, by, human, beings, with, minimal, standardized, equipment, generally, speaking, remote, sensing, works, on, the, principle, of, the, inverse, problem, while, the, object, or, phenomenon, of, interest, the, state, may, not, be, directly, measured, there, exists, some, other, variable, that, can, be, detected, and, measured, the, observation, which, may, be, related, to, the, object, of, interest, through, a, calculation, the, common, analogy, given, to, describe, this, is, trying, to, determine, the, type, of, animal, from, its, footprints, for, example, while, it, is, impossible, to, directly, measure, temperatures, in, the, upper, atmosphere, it, is, possible, to, measure, the, spectral, emissions, from, a, known, chemical, species, such, as, carbon, dioxide, in, that, region, the, frequency, of, the, emissions, may, then, be, related, via, thermodynamics, to, the, temperature, in, that, region, to, facilitate, the, discussion, of, data, processing, in, practice, several, processing, levels, were, first, defined, in, 1986, by, nasa, as, part, of, its, earth, observing, system, and, steadily, adopted, since, then, both, internally, at, nasa, e, g, and, elsewhere, e, g, these, definitions, are, a, level, 1, data, record, is, the, most, fundamental, i, e, highest, reversible, level, data, record, that, has, significant, scientific, utility, and, is, the, foundation, upon, which, all, subsequent, data, sets, are, produced, level, 2, is, the, first, level, that, is, directly, usable, for, most, scientific, applications, its, value, is, much, greater, than, the, lower, levels, level, 2, data, sets, tend, to, be, less, voluminous, than, level, 1, data, because, they, have, been, reduced, temporally, spatially, or, spectrally, level, 3, data, sets, are, generally, smaller, than, lower, level, data, sets, and, thus, can, be, dealt, with, without, incurring, a, great, deal, of, data, handling, overhead, these, data, tend, to, be, generally, more, useful, for, many, applications, the, regular, spatial, and, temporal, organization, of, level, 3, datasets, makes, it, feasible, to, readily, combine, data, from, different, sources, while, these, processing, levels, are, particularly, suitable, for, typical, satellite, data, processing, pipelines, other, data, level, vocabularies, have, been, defined, and, may, be, appropriate, for, more, heterogeneous, workflows, satellite, images, provide, very, useful, information, to, produce, statistics, on, topics, closely, related, to, the, territory, such, as, agriculture, forestry, or, land, cover, in, general, the, first, large, project, to, apply, landsata, 1, images, for, statistics, was, lacie, large, area, crop, inventory, experiment, run, by, nasa, noaa, and, the, usda, in, 1974, 77, many, other, application, projects, on, crop, area, estimation, have, followed, including, the, italian, agrit, project, and, the, mars, project, of, the, joint, research, centre, jrc, of, the, european, commission, forest, area, and, deforestation, estimation, have, also, been, a, frequent, target, of, remote, sensing, projects, the, same, as, land, cover, and, land, use, ground, truth, or, reference, data, to, train, and, validate, image, classification, require, a, field, survey, if, we, are, targetting, annual, crops, or, individual, forest, species, but, may, be, substituted, by, photointerpretation, if, we, look, at, wider, classes, that, can, be, reliably, identified, on, aerial, photos, or, satellite, images, it, is, relevant, to, highlight, that, probabilistic, sampling, is, not, critical, for, the, selection, of, training, pixels, for, image, classification, but, it, is, necessary, for, accuracy, assessment, of, the, classified, images, and, area, estimation, additional, care, is, recommended, to, ensure, that, training, and, validation, datasets, are, not, spatially, correlated, we, suppose, now, that, we, have, classified, images, or, a, land, cover, map, produced, by, visual, photo, interpretation, with, a, legend, of, mapped, classes, that, suits, our, purpose, taking, again, the, example, of, wheat, the, straightforward, approach, is, counting, the, number, of, pixels, classified, as, wheat, and, multiplying, by, the, area, of, each, pixel, many, authors, have, noticed, that, estimator, is, that, it, is, generally, biased, because, commission, and, omission, errors, in, a, confusion, matrix, do, not, compensate, each, other, the, main, strength, of, classified, satellite, images, or, other, indicators, computed, on, satellite, images, is, providing, cheap, information, on, the, whole, target, area, or, most, of, it, this, information, usually, has, a, good, correlation, with, the, target, variable, ground, truth, that, is, usually, expensive, to, observe, in, an, unbiased, and, accurate, way, therefore, it, can, be, observed, on, a, probabilistic, sample, selected, on, an, area, sampling, frame, traditional, survey, methodology, provides, different, methods, to, combine, accurate, information, on, a, sample, with, less, accurate, but, exhaustive, data, for, a, covariable, or, proxy, that, is, cheaper, to, collect, for, agricultural, statistics, field, surveys, are, usually, required, while, photo, interpretation, may, better, for, land, cover, classes, that, can, be, reliably, identified, on, aerial, photographs, or, high, resolution, satellite, images, additional, uncertainty, can, appear, because, of, imperfect, reference, data, ground, truth, or, similar, some, options, are, ratio, estimator, regression, estimator, calibration, estimators, and, small, area, estimators, if, we, target, other, variables, such, as, crop, yield, or, leaf, area, we, may, need, different, indicators, to, be, computed, from, images, such, as, the, ndvi, a, good, proxy, to, chlorophyll, activity, the, modern, discipline, of, remote, sensing, arose, with, the, development, of, flight, the, balloonist, g, tournachon, alias, nadar, made, photographs, of, paris, from, his, balloon, in, 1858, messenger, pigeons, kites, rockets, and, unmanned, balloons, were, also, used, for, early, images, with, the, exception, of, balloons, these, first, individual, images, were, not, particularly, useful, for, map, making, or, for, scientific, purposes, systematic, aerial, photography, was, developed, for, military, surveillance, and, reconnaissance, purposes, beginning, in, world, war, i, after, wwi, remote, sensing, technology, was, quickly, adapted, to, civilian, applications, this, is, demonstrated, by, the, first, line, of, a, 1941, textbook, titled, aerophotography, and, aerosurverying, which, stated, the, following, there, is, no, longer, any, need, to, preach, for, aerial, photography, not, in, the, united, states, for, so, widespread, has, become, its, use, and, so, great, its, value, that, even, the, farmer, who, plants, his, fields, in, a, remote, corner, of, the, country, knows, its, value, the, development, of, remote, sensing, technology, reached, a, climax, during, the, cold, war, with, the, use, of, modified, combat, aircraft, such, as, the, p, 51, p, 38, rb, 66, and, the, f, 4c, or, specifically, designed, collection, platforms, such, as, the, u2, tr, 1, sr, 71, a, 5, and, the, ov, 1, series, both, in, overhead, and, stand, off, collection, a, more, recent, development, is, that, of, increasingly, smaller, sensor, pods, such, as, those, used, by, law, enforcement, and, the, military, in, both, manned, and, unmanned, platforms, the, advantage, of, this, approach, is, that, this, requires, minimal, modification, to, a, given, airframe, later, imaging, technologies, would, include, infrared, conventional, doppler, and, synthetic, aperture, radar, the, development, of, artificial, satellites, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, allowed, remote, sensing, to, progress, to, a, global, scale, as, of, the, end, of, the, cold, war, instrumentation, aboard, various, earth, observing, and, weather, satellites, such, as, landsat, the, nimbus, and, more, recent, missions, such, as, radarsat, and, uars, provided, global, measurements, of, various, data, for, civil, research, and, military, purposes, space, probes, to, other, planets, have, also, provided, the, opportunity, to, conduct, remote, sensing, studies, in, extraterrestrial, environments, synthetic, aperture, radar, aboard, the, magellan, spacecraft, provided, detailed, topographic, maps, of, venus, while, instruments, aboard, soho, allowed, studies, to, be, performed, on, the, sun, and, the, solar, wind, just, to, name, a, few, examples, recent, developments, include, beginning, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, development, of, image, processing, of, satellite, imagery, the, use, of, the, term, remote, sensing, began, in, the, early, 1960s, when, evelyn, pruitt, realized, that, advances, in, science, meant, that, aerial, photography, was, no, longer, an, adequate, term, to, describe, the, data, streams, being, generated, by, new, technologies, with, assistance, from, her, fellow, staff, member, at, the, office, of, naval, research, walter, bailey, she, coined, the, term, remote, sensing, several, research, groups, in, silicon, valley, including, nasa, ames, research, center, gte, and, esl, inc, developed, fourier, transform, techniques, leading, to, the, first, notable, enhancement, of, imagery, data, in, 1999, the, first, commercial, satellite, ikonos, collecting, very, high, resolution, imagery, was, launched, remote, sensing, has, a, growing, relevance, in, the, modern, information, society, it, represents, a, key, technology, as, part, of, the, aerospace, industry, and, bears, increasing, economic, relevance, new, sensors, e, g, terrasar, x, and, rapideye, are, developed, constantly, and, the, demand, for, skilled, labour, is, increasing, steadily, furthermore, remote, sensing, exceedingly, influences, everyday, life, ranging, from, weather, forecasts, to, reports, on, climate, change, or, natural, disasters, as, an, example, 80, of, the, german, students, use, the, services, of, google, earth, in, 2006, alone, the, software, was, downloaded, 100, million, times, but, studies, have, shown, that, only, a, fraction, of, them, know, more, about, the, data, they, are, working, with, there, exists, a, huge, knowledge, gap, between, the, application, and, the, understanding, of, satellite, images, remote, sensing, only, plays, a, tangential, role, in, schools, regardless, of, the, political, claims, to, strengthen, the, support, for, teaching, on, the, subject, a, lot, of, the, computer, software, explicitly, developed, for, school, lessons, has, not, yet, been, implemented, due, to, its, complexity, thereby, the, subject, is, either, not, at, all, integrated, into, the, curriculum, or, does, not, pass, the, step, of, an, interpretation, of, analogue, images, in, fact, the, subject, of, remote, sensing, requires, a, consolidation, of, physics, and, mathematics, as, well, as, competences, in, the, fields, of, media, and, methods, apart, from, the, mere, visual, interpretation, of, satellite, images, many, teachers, have, great, interest, in, the, subject, remote, sensing, being, motivated, to, integrate, this, topic, into, teaching, provided, that, the, curriculum, is, considered, in, many, cases, this, encouragement, fails, because, of, confusing, information, in, order, to, integrate, remote, sensing, in, a, sustainable, manner, organizations, like, the, egu, or, digital, earth, encourage, the, development, of, learning, modules, and, learning, portals, examples, include, fis, remote, sensing, in, school, lessons, geospektiv, ychange, or, spatial, discovery, to, promote, media, and, method, qualifications, as, well, as, independent, learning, remote, sensing, data, are, processed, and, analyzed, with, computer, software, known, as, a, remote, sensing, application, a, large, number, of, proprietary, and, open, source, applications, exist, to, process, remote, sensing, data, there, are, applications, of, gamma, rays, to, mineral, exploration, through, remote, sensing, in, 1972, more, than, two, million, dollars, were, spent, on, remote, sensing, applications, with, gamma, rays, to, mineral, exploration, gamma, rays, are, used, to, search, for, deposits, of, uranium, by, observing, radioactivity, from, potassium, porphyry, copper, deposits, can, be, located, a, high, ratio, of, uranium, to, thorium, has, been, found, to, be, related, to, the, presence, of, hydrothermal, copper, deposits, radiation, patterns, have, also, been, known, to, occur, above, oil, and, gas, fields, but, some, of, these, patterns, were, thought, to, be, due, to, surface, soils, instead, of, oil, and, gas, an, earth, observation, satellite, or, earth, remote, sensing, satellite, is, a, satellite, used, or, designed, for, earth, observation, eo, from, orbit, including, spy, satellites, and, similar, ones, intended, for, non, military, uses, such, as, environmental, monitoring, meteorology, cartography, and, others, the, most, common, type, are, earth, imaging, satellites, that, take, satellite, images, analogous, to, aerial, photographs, some, eo, satellites, may, perform, remote, sensing, without, forming, pictures, such, as, in, gnss, radio, occultation, the, first, occurrence, of, satellite, remote, sensing, can, be, dated, to, the, launch, of, the, first, artificial, satellite, sputnik, 1, by, the, soviet, union, on, october, 4, 1957, sputnik, 1, sent, back, radio, signals, which, scientists, used, to, study, the, ionosphere, the, united, states, army, ballistic, missile, agency, launched, the, first, american, satellite, explorer, 1, for, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, on, january, 31, 1958, the, information, sent, back, from, its, radiation, detector, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, earth, s, van, allen, radiation, belts, the, tiros, 1, spacecraft, launched, on, april, 1, 1960, as, part, of, nasa, s, television, infrared, observation, satellite, tiros, program, sent, back, the, first, television, footage, of, weather, patterns, to, be, taken, from, space, in, 2008, more, than, 150, earth, observation, satellites, were, in, orbit, recording, data, with, both, passive, and, active, sensors, and, acquiring, more, than, 10, terabits, of, data, daily, by, 2021, that, total, had, grown, to, over, 950, with, the, largest, number, of, satellites, operated, by, us, based, company, planet, labs, most, earth, observation, satellites, carry, instruments, that, should, be, operated, at, a, relatively, low, altitude, most, orbit, at, altitudes, above, 500, to, 600, kilometers, 310, to, 370, mi, lower, orbits, have, significant, air, drag, which, makes, frequent, orbit, reboost, maneuvers, necessary, the, earth, observation, satellites, ers, 1, ers, 2, and, envisat, of, european, space, agency, as, well, as, the, metop, spacecraft, of, eumetsat, are, all, operated, at, altitudes, of, about, 800, km, 500, mi, the, proba, 1, proba, 2, and, smos, spacecraft, of, european, space, agency, are, observing, the, earth, from, an, altitude, of, about, 700, km, 430, mi, the, earth, observation, satellites, of, uae, dubaisat, 1, dubaisat, 2, are, also, placed, in, low, earth, orbits, leo, orbits, and, providing, satellite, imagery, of, various, parts, of, the, earth, to, get, global, coverage, with, a, low, orbit, a, polar, orbit, is, used, a, low, orbit, will, have, an, orbital, period, of, roughly, 100, minutes, and, the, earth, will, rotate, around, its, polar, axis, about, 25, between, successive, orbits, the, ground, track, moves, towards, the, west, 25, each, orbit, allowing, a, different, section, of, the, globe, to, be, scanned, with, each, orbit, most, are, in, sun, synchronous, orbits
