a, country, is, a, distinct, part, of, the, world, such, as, a, state, nation, or, other, political, entity, when, referring, to, a, specific, polity, the, term, country, may, refer, to, a, sovereign, state, states, with, limited, recognition, constituent, country, or, a, dependent, territory, most, sovereign, states, but, not, all, countries, are, members, of, the, united, nations, there, is, no, universal, agreement, on, the, number, of, countries, in, the, world, since, several, states, have, disputed, sovereignty, status, limited, recognition, and, a, number, of, non, sovereign, entities, are, commonly, called, countries, the, definition, and, usage, of, the, word, country, are, flexible, and, has, changed, over, time, the, economist, wrote, in, 2010, that, any, attempt, to, find, a, clear, definition, of, a, country, soon, runs, into, a, thicket, of, exceptions, and, anomalies, areas, much, smaller, than, a, political, entity, may, be, referred, to, as, a, country, such, as, the, west, country, in, england, big, sky, country, used, in, various, contexts, of, the, american, west, coal, country, used, to, describe, coal, mining, regions, or, simply, the, country, used, to, describe, a, rural, area, the, term, country, is, also, used, as, a, qualifier, descriptively, such, as, country, music, or, country, living, the, word, country, comes, from, old, french, contr, e, which, derives, from, vulgar, latin, terra, contrata, land, lying, opposite, land, spread, before, derived, from, contra, against, opposite, it, most, likely, entered, the, english, language, after, the, franco, norman, invasion, during, the, 11th, century, in, english, the, word, has, increasingly, become, associated, with, political, divisions, so, that, one, sense, associated, with, the, indefinite, article, a, country, is, now, frequently, applied, as, a, synonym, for, a, state, or, a, former, sovereign, state, it, may, also, be, used, as, a, synonym, for, nation, taking, as, examples, canada, sri, lanka, and, yugoslavia, cultural, anthropologist, clifford, geertz, wrote, in, 1997, that, it, is, clear, that, the, relationships, between, country, and, nation, are, so, different, from, one, to, the, next, as, to, be, impossible, to, fold, into, a, dichotomous, opposition, as, they, are, into, a, promiscuous, fusion, areas, much, smaller, than, a, political, state, may, be, referred, to, as, countries, such, as, the, west, country, in, england, big, sky, country, used, in, various, contexts, of, the, american, west, coal, country, used, to, describe, coal, mining, regions, in, several, sovereign, states, and, many, other, terms, the, word, country, is, also, used, for, the, sense, of, native, sovereign, territory, such, as, the, widespread, use, of, indian, country, in, the, united, states, the, term, country, in, english, may, also, be, wielded, to, describe, rural, areas, or, used, in, the, form, countryside, raymond, williams, a, welsh, scholar, wrote, in, 1975, country, and, city, are, very, powerful, words, and, this, is, not, surprising, when, we, remember, how, much, they, seem, to, stand, for, in, the, experience, of, human, communities, in, english, country, is, both, a, nation, and, a, part, of, a, land, the, country, can, be, the, whole, society, or, its, rural, area, in, the, long, history, of, human, settlements, this, connection, between, the, land, from, which, directly, or, indirectly, we, all, get, our, living, and, the, achievements, of, human, society, has, been, deeply, known, the, unclear, definition, of, country, in, modern, english, was, further, commented, upon, by, philosopher, simon, keller, often, a, country, is, presumed, to, be, identical, with, a, collection, of, citizens, sometimes, people, say, that, a, country, is, a, project, or, an, idea, or, an, ideal, occasionally, philosophers, entertain, more, metaphysically, ambitious, pictures, suggesting, that, a, country, is, an, organic, entity, with, its, own, independent, life, and, character, or, that, a, country, is, an, autonomous, agent, just, like, you, or, me, such, claims, are, rarely, explained, or, defended, however, and, it, is, not, clear, how, they, should, be, assessed, we, attribute, so, many, different, kinds, of, properties, to, countries, speaking, as, though, a, country, can, feature, wheat, fields, waving, or, be, girt, by, sea, can, have, a, founding, date, and, be, democratic, and, free, can, be, english, speaking, culturally, diverse, war, torn, or, islamic, melissa, lucashenko, an, aboriginal, australian, writer, expressed, the, difficulty, of, defining, country, in, a, 2005, essay, unsettlement, what, is, this, thing, country, what, does, country, mean, i, spoke, with, others, who, said, country, meant, home, but, who, added, the, caveat, that, home, resided, in, people, rather, than, places, a, kind, of, portable, country, i, tried, to, tease, out, some, ways, in, which, non, indigenous, people, have, understood, country, i, made, categories, country, as, economy, country, as, geography, country, as, society, country, as, myth, country, as, history, for, all, that, i, walked, slept, breathed, and, dreamed, country, the, language, still, would, not, come, when, referring, to, a, specific, polity, the, term, country, may, refer, to, a, sovereign, state, states, with, limited, recognition, constituent, country, or, a, dependent, territory, a, sovereign, state, is, a, political, entity, that, has, supreme, legitimate, authority, over, a, part, of, the, world, there, is, no, universal, agreement, on, the, number, of, countries, in, the, world, since, several, states, have, disputed, sovereignty, status, and, a, number, of, non, sovereign, entities, are, commonly, called, countries, no, definition, is, binding, on, all, the, members, of, the, community, of, nations, on, the, criteria, for, statehood, state, practice, relating, to, the, recognition, of, a, country, typically, falls, somewhere, between, the, declaratory, and, constitutive, approaches, international, law, defines, sovereign, states, as, having, a, permanent, population, defined, territory, a, government, not, under, another, and, the, capacity, to, interact, with, other, states, the, declarative, theory, outlined, in, the, 1933, montevideo, convention, describes, a, state, in, article, 1, as, the, montevideo, convention, in, article, 3, implies, that, a, sovereign, state, can, still, be, a, sovereign, state, even, if, no, other, countries, recognise, that, it, exists, as, a, restatement, of, customary, international, law, the, montevideo, convention, merely, codified, existing, legal, norms, and, its, principles, and, therefore, does, not, apply, merely, to, the, signatories, of, international, organizations, such, as, the, united, nations, but, to, all, subjects, of, international, law, as, a, whole, a, similar, opinion, has, been, expressed, by, the, european, economic, community, reiterated, by, the, european, union, in, the, principal, statement, of, its, badinter, committee, and, by, judge, challis, professor, james, crawford, according, to, the, constitutive, theory, a, state, is, a, legal, entity, of, international, law, if, and, only, if, it, is, recognised, as, sovereign, by, at, least, one, other, country, because, of, this, new, states, could, not, immediately, become, part, of, the, international, community, or, be, bound, by, international, law, and, recognised, nations, did, not, have, to, respect, international, law, in, their, dealings, with, them, in, 1912, l, f, l, oppenheim, said, the, following, regarding, constitutive, theory, international, law, does, not, say, that, a, state, is, not, in, existence, as, long, as, it, is, not, recognised, but, it, takes, no, notice, of, it, before, its, recognition, through, recognition, only, and, exclusively, a, state, becomes, an, international, person, and, a, subject, of, international, law, in, 1976, the, organisation, of, african, unity, define, state, recognition, as, the, recognition, of, an, independent, and, sovereign, state, is, an, act, of, sovereignty, pertaining, each, member, of, the, international, community, an, act, to, be, taken, individually, and, it, is, therefore, up, to, member, states, and, each, oau, power, whether, to, recognise, or, not, the, newly, independent, state, some, countries, such, as, taiwan, sahrawi, republic, and, kosovo, have, disputed, sovereignty, and, or, limited, recognition, among, some, countries, some,

personal, flag, of, its, rulers, however, over, time, the, practice, of, using, personal, banners, as, flags, of, places, was, abandoned, in, favor, of, flags, that, had, some, significance, to, the, nation, often, its, patron, saint, early, examples, of, these, were, the, maritime, republics, such, as, genoa, which, could, be, said, to, have, a, national, flag, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, however, these, were, still, mostly, used, in, the, context, of, marine, identification, although, some, flags, date, back, earlier, widespread, use, of, flags, outside, of, military, or, naval,
