the, gulf, of, carpentaria, k, r, p, n, t, r, i, is, a, sea, off, the, northern, coast, of, australia, it, is, enclosed, on, three, sides, by, northern, australia, and, bounded, on, the, north, by, the, eastern, arafura, sea, which, separates, australia, and, new, guinea, the, northern, boundary, is, generally, defined, as, a, line, from, slade, point, queensland, the, northwestern, corner, of, cape, york, peninsula, in, the, northeast, to, cape, arnhem, on, the, gove, peninsula, northern, territory, the, easternmost, point, of, arnhem, land, in, the, west, at, its, mouth, the, gulf, is, 590, km, 370, mi, wide, and, further, south, 675, km, 420, mi, the, north, south, length, exceeds, 700, km, 430, mi, it, covers, a, water, area, of, about, 300, 000, km, 2, 120, 000, sq, mi, the, general, depth, is, between, 55, and, 66, metres, 30, and, 36, fathoms, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 69, metres, 38, fathoms, the, tidal, range, in, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, is, between, two, and, three, metres, 6, 5, and, 10, ft, the, gulf, and, adjacent, sahul, shelf, were, dry, land, at, the, peak, of, the, last, ice, age, 18, 000, years, ago, when, global, sea, level, was, around, 120, m, 390, ft, below, its, present, position, at, that, time, a, large, shallow, lake, occupied, the, centre, of, what, is, now, the, gulf, the, gulf, hosts, a, submerged, coral, reef, province, that, was, only, recognised, in, 2004, yulluna, also, known, as, yalarnga, yalarrnga, jalanga, jalannga, wonganja, gunggalida, jokula, is, an, australian, aboriginal, language, the, yulluna, language, region, includes, the, local, government, boundaries, of, the, shire, of, cloncurry, kayardild, also, known, as, kaiadilt, and, gayadilta, is, a, language, of, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, the, kayardild, language, region, includes, the, landscape, within, the, local, government, boundaries, of, the, mornington, shire, council, the, first, european, explorer, to, visit, the, region, and, australia, was, the, dutch, willem, janszoon, whose, name, is, also, written, as, jansz, in, his, 1605, 06, voyage, his, fellow, countryman, jan, carstenszoon, or, carstensz, visited, in, 1623, and, named, the, gulf, in, honour, of, pieter, de, carpentier, at, that, time, the, governor, general, of, the, dutch, east, indies, abel, tasman, also, explored, the, coast, in, 1644, the, region, was, later, explored, and, charted, by, the, english, navigator, matthew, flinders, in, 1802, and, 1803, the, first, overland, expedition, to, reach, the, gulf, was, the, burke, and, wills, expedition, led, by, robert, o, hara, burke, and, william, john, wills, which, left, melbourne, victoria, in, august, 1860, and, reached, the, mouth, of, the, bynoe, river, in, february, 1861, however, both, men, died, on, the, return, journey, the, land, bordering, the, gulf, is, generally, flat, and, low, lying, to, the, west, is, arnhem, land, and, groote, eylandt, the, largest, island, in, the, gulf, to, the, east, is, the, top, end, of, the, northern, territory, including, the, cape, york, peninsula, and, the, torres, strait, which, joins, the, gulf, to, the, coral, sea, the, area, to, the, south, like, the, cape, york, peninsula, part, of, queensland, is, known, as, the, gulf, country, the, gulf, country, supports, the, world, s, largest, intact, savanna, woodlands, as, well, as, native, grasslands, known, as, the, carpentaria, tropical, savanna, the, woodlands, also, extend, up, the, west, and, east, coast, of, the, gulf, they, are, dominated, by, eucalyptus, and, melaleuca, species, from, the, family, myrtaceae, the, climate, is, hot, and, humid, with, two, seasons, per, year, the, dry, season, lasts, from, about, april, until, november, and, is, characterized, by, very, dry, southeast, to, east, winds, generated, by, migratory, winter, high, pressure, systems, to, the, south, the, wet, season, lasts, from, december, to, march, most, of, the, year, s, rainfall, is, compressed, into, these, months, and, during, this, period, many, low, lying, areas, are, flooded, the, gulf, is, prone, to, tropical, cyclones, during, the, period, between, november, and, april, the, gulf, experiences, an, average, of, three, cyclones, each, year, that, are, thought, to, transport, sediments, in, a, clockwise, direction, along, the, gulf, s, coast, in, many, other, parts, of, australia, there, are, dramatic, climatic, transitions, over, fairly, short, distances, the, great, dividing, range, which, parallels, the, entire, east, and, south, east, coast, is, responsible, for, the, typical, pattern, of, a, well, watered, coastal, strip, a, fairly, narrow, band, of, mountains, and, then, a, vast, inward, draining, plain, that, receives, little, rainfall, in, the, gulf, country, however, there, are, no, mountains, to, restrict, rainfall, to, the, coastal, band, and, the, transition, from, the, profuse, tropical, growth, of, the, seaside, areas, to, the, arid, scrubs, of, central, australia, is, gradual, in, september, and, october, the, morning, glory, cloud, appears, in, the, southern, gulf, the, best, vantage, point, to, see, this, phenomenon, is, in, the, burketown, area, shortly, after, dawn, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, gulf, experienced, a, major, asteroid, impact, event, in, 536, ad, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, is, known, to, contain, fringing, reefs, and, isolated, coral, colonies, but, no, near, surface, patch, or, barrier, reefs, exist, in, the, gulf, at, the, present, time, however, this, has, not, always, been, the, case, expeditions, carried, out, by, geoscience, australia, in, 2003, and, in, 2005, aboard, the, rv, southern, surveyor, revealed, the, presence, of, a, submerged, coral, reef, province, covering, at, least, 300, km, 2, 120, sq, mi, in, the, southern, gulf, the, patch, reefs, have, their, upper, surfaces, at, a, mean, water, depth, of, 28, 6, 0, 5, m, 94, 1, 5, ft, were, undetected, by, satellites, or, aerial, photographs, and, were, only, recognised, using, multibeam, swath, sonar, surveys, supplemented, with, seabed, sampling, and, video, their, existence, points, to, an, earlier, late, quaternary, phase, of, framework, reef, growth, under, cooler, climate, and, lower, sea, level, conditions, than, today, in, the, top, end, the, roper, river, walker, river, and, wilton, river, flow, into, the, gulf, the, cox, river, calvert, river, leichhardt, river, mcarthur, river, flinders, river, norman, river, and, the, gilbert, river, drain, the, gulf, country, a, number, of, rivers, flow, from, the, cape, york, peninsula, into, the, gulf, including, smithburne, river, mitchell, river, alice, river, staaten, river, mission, river, wenlock, river, and, archer, river, extensive, areas, of, seagrass, beds, have, allowed, commercial, shrimp, operations, in, the, gulf, zinc, lead, and, silver, is, mined, from, the, mcarthur, river, zinc, mine, and, exported, via, the, gulf, another, zinc, mine, century, zinc, is, in, the, gulf, on, the, queensland, side, of, the, border, it, exports, its, product, through, the, port, facility, at, karumba, the, cattle, industry, is, also, a, very, important, part, of, the, regional, economy, in, the, gulf, according, to, the, then, chairman, of, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, s, commercial, fisherman, s, organisation, gary, ward, the, number, of, sightings, of, indonesian, vessels, fishing, illegally, in, the, gulf, s, waters, increased, in, early, 2005, by, 2011, the, numbers, of, illegal, fishing, boat, interceptions, had, declined, significantly, with, the, cause, attributed, to, enforcement, efforts, and, education, programs, in, indonesia, in, 2012, a, major, new, port, located, to, the, west, of, karumba, and, rail, connection, to, the, north, west, minerals, province, was, proposed, by, carpentaria, rail, the, advantages, of, a, port, at, karumba, compared, to, townsville, was, that, it, was, three, or, four, days, closer, to, asia, via, shipping, routes, additionally, expansion, is, taking, place, of, the, bing, bong, port, which, services, the, mcarthur, river, zinc, mine, awarded, the, northern, territory, earth, award, the, gulf, is, one, of, the, distinct, physiographic, sections, of, the, larger, and, surrounding, carpentaria, basin, province, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, larger,
