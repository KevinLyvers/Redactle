the, red, sea, is, a, sea, inlet, of, the, indian, ocean, lying, between, africa, and, asia, its, connection, to, the, ocean, is, in, the, south, through, the, bab, el, mandeb, strait, and, the, gulf, of, aden, to, its, north, lie, the, sinai, peninsula, the, gulf, of, aqaba, and, the, gulf, of, suez, leading, to, the, suez, canal, it, is, underlain, by, the, red, sea, rift, which, is, part, of, the, great, rift, valley, the, red, sea, has, a, surface, area, of, roughly, 438, 000, km, 2, 169, 000, sq, mi, is, about, 2, 250, km, 1, 400, mi, long, and, 355, km, 221, mi, wide, at, its, widest, point, it, has, an, average, depth, of, 490, m, 1, 610, ft, and, in, the, central, suakin, trough, it, reaches, its, maximum, depth, of, 3, 040, m, 9, 970, ft, approximately, 40, of, the, red, sea, is, quite, shallow, at, less, than, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, and, about, 25, is, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, deep, the, extensive, shallow, shelves, are, noted, for, their, marine, life, and, corals, more, than, 1, 000, invertebrate, species, and, 200, types, of, soft, and, hard, coral, live, in, the, sea, the, red, sea, is, the, world, s, northernmost, tropical, sea, and, has, been, designated, a, global, 200, ecoregion, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, red, sea, as, follows, on, the, north, the, southern, limits, of, the, gulfs, of, suez, and, aqaba, on, the, south, a, line, joining, husn, murad, 12, 40, n, 43, 30, e, 12, 667, n, 43, 500, e, 12, 667, 43, 500, and, ras, siyyan, 12, 29, n, 43, 20, e, 12, 483, n, 43, 333, e, 12, 483, 43, 333, exclusive, economic, zones, in, red, sea, note, hala, ib, triangle, disputed, between, sudan, and, egypt, and, calculated, for, both, red, sea, has, names, in, many, languages, modern, arabic, romanized, al, ba, r, al, a, mar, medieval, arabic, romanized, ba, r, al, qulzum, biblical, hebrew, romanized, yam, s, p, or, hebrew, romanized, hayy, m, h, m, coptic, phiom, enhah, or, phiom, ari, tigrinya, qeyih, bahri, somali, badda, cas, afar, qasa, bad, red, sea, is, a, direct, translation, of, the, ancient, greek, erythra, thalassa, the, sea, itself, was, once, referred, to, as, the, erythraean, sea, by, europeans, as, well, as, mare, rubrum, in, latin, alternatively, sinus, arabicus, literally, arabian, gulf, the, romans, called, it, pontus, herculis, sea, of, hercules, other, designations, include, the, arabic, romanized, al, ba, r, al, a, mar, alternatively, ba, r, al, qulzum, literally, the, sea, of, clysma, the, coptic, phiom, n, ari, syriac, yamm, summ, q, somali, badda, cas, and, tigrinya, qeyyi, b, r, the, name, of, the, sea, may, signify, the, seasonal, blooms, of, the, red, coloured, trichodesmium, erythraeum, near, the, water, s, surface, a, theory, favored, by, some, modern, scholars, is, that, the, name, red, is, referring, to, the, direction, south, just, as, the, black, sea, s, name, may, refer, to, north, the, basis, of, this, theory, is, that, some, asiatic, languages, used, color, words, to, refer, to, the, cardinal, directions, herodotus, on, one, occasion, uses, red, sea, and, southern, sea, interchangeably, the, name, in, hebrew, yam, suph, hebrew, lit, sea, of, reeds, is, of, biblical, origin, the, name, in, coptic, phiom, enhah, sea, of, hah, is, connected, to, ancient, egyptian, root, which, refers, to, water, and, sea, for, example, the, names, of, the, ogdoad, gods, heh, and, hauhet, historically, it, was, also, known, to, western, geographers, as, mare, mecca, sea, of, mecca, and, sinus, arabicus, gulf, of, arabia, some, ancient, geographers, called, the, red, sea, the, arabian, gulf, or, gulf, of, arabia, the, association, of, the, red, sea, with, the, biblical, account, of, the, israelites, crossing, the, red, sea, is, ancient, and, was, made, explicit, in, the, septuagint, translation, of, the, book, of, exodus, from, hebrew, to, koine, greek, in, approximately, the, third, century, bc, in, that, version, the, yam, suph, hebrew, lit, sea, of, reeds, is, translated, as, erythra, thalassa, red, sea, the, red, sea, is, one, of, four, seas, named, in, english, after, common, color, terms, the, others, being, the, black, sea, the, white, sea, and, the, yellow, sea, the, direct, rendition, of, the, greek, erythra, thalassa, in, latin, as, mare, erythraeum, refers, to, the, north, western, part, of, the, indian, ocean, and, also, to, a, region, on, mars, the, earliest, known, exploration, of, the, red, sea, was, conducted, by, ancient, egyptians, as, they, attempted, to, establish, commercial, routes, to, punt, one, such, expedition, took, place, around, 2500, bc, and, another, around, 1500, bc, by, hatshepsut, both, involved, long, voyages, down, the, red, sea, the, biblical, book, of, exodus, tells, the, account, of, the, israelites, crossing, of, the, sea, which, the, hebrew, text, calls, yam, suph, hebrew, yam, suph, was, traditionally, identified, as, the, red, sea, rabbi, saadia, gaon, 882, 942, in, his, judeo, arabic, translation, of, the, pentateuch, identifies, the, crossing, place, of, the, red, sea, as, ba, ar, al, qulzum, meaning, the, gulf, of, suez, in, the, 6th, century, bc, darius, the, great, who, was, a, prominent, ruler, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, persia, undertook, significant, efforts, to, improve, and, extend, navigation, in, the, red, sea, he, sent, reconnaissance, missions, to, explore, the, red, sea, area, and, to, identify, its, various, navigational, hazards, such, as, rocks, and, currents, this, effort, was, significant, as, it, contributed, to, safer, and, more, efficient, navigation, routes, in, addition, to, the, maritime, explorations, during, the, reign, of, darius, the, great, a, canal, was, constructed, linking, the, nile, river, to, the, northern, end, of, the, red, sea, at, suez, this, canal, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, ancient, suez, canal, it, played, a, pivotal, role, in, improving, trade, and, communication, between, the, nile, valley, and, the, red, sea, and, beyond, to, the, indian, ocean, this, canal, was, a, predecessor, to, the, modern, suez, canal, which, was, constructed, in, the, 19th, century, and, continues, to, be, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, waterways, the, construction, of, the, canal, during, darius, s, reign, is, evidenced, by, ancient, records, including, inscriptions, darius, commemorated, the, completion, of, the, canal, by, creating, stelae, stone, monuments, with, inscriptions, in, several, languages, describing, the, construction, and, its, benefits, the, canal, not, only, facilitated, trade, but, also, solidified, darius, s, control, over, egypt, and, enhanced, the, achaemenid, empire, s, economic, and, political, power, in, the, region, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, alexander, the, great, sent, greek, naval, expeditions, down, the, red, sea, to, the, indian, ocean, greek, navigators, continued, to, explore, and, compile, data, on, the, red, sea, agatharchides, collected, information, about, the, sea, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, periplus, of, the, red, sea, a, greek, periplus, written, by, an, unknown, author, around, the, 1st, century, contains, a, detailed, description, of, the, red, sea, s, ports, and, sea, routes, the, periplus, also, describes, how, hippalus, first, discovered, the, direct, route, from, the, red, sea, to, india, the, red, sea, was, favored, for, roman, trade, with, india, starting, with, the, reign, of, augustus, when, the, roman, empire, gained, control, over, the, mediterranean, egypt, and, the, northern, red, sea, the, route, had, been, used, by, previous, states, but, grew, in, the, volume, of, traffic, under, the, romans, from, indian, ports, goods, from, china, were, introduced, to, the, roman, world, contact, between, rome, and, china, depended, on, the, red, sea, but, the, route, was, broken, by, the, aksumite, empire, around, the, 3rd, century, ad, from, antiquity, until, the, 20th, century, the, red, sea, was, also, a, trade, route, of, the, red, sea, slave, trade, from, africa, to, the, middle, east, during, the, middle, ages, the, red, sea, was, an, important, part, of, the, spice, trade, route, in, 1183, raynald, of, ch, tillon, launched, a, raid, down, the, red, sea, to, attack, the, muslim, pilgrim, convoys, to, mecca, the, possibility, that, raynald, s, fleet, might, sack, the, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, caused, fury, throughout, the, muslim, world, however, it, appears, that, reynald, s, target, was, the, lightly, armed, muslim, pilgrim, convoys, rather, than, the, well, guarded, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, and, the, belief, in, the, muslim, world, that, reynald, was, seeking, to, sack, the, holy, cities, due, to, the, proximity, of, those, cities, to, the, areas, that, raynald, raided, in, 1513, trying, to, secure, that, channel, to, portugal, afonso, de, albuquerque, laid, siege, to, aden, but, was, forced, to, retreat, they, cruised, the, red, sea, inside, the, bab, al, mandab, as, the, first, fleet, from, europe, in, modern, times, to, have, sailed, these, waters, later, in, 1524, the, city, was, delivered, to, governor, heitor, da, silveira, as, an, agreement, for, protection, from, the, ottomans, in, 1798, france, ordered, general, napoleon, to, invade, egypt, and, take, control, of, the, red, sea, although, he, failed, in, his, mission, the, engineer, jean, baptiste, lep, re, who, took, part, in, it, revitalised, the, plan, for, a, canal, which, had, been, envisaged, during, the, reign, of, the, pharaohs, several, canals, were, built, in, ancient, times, from, the, nile, to, the, red, sea, along, or, near, the, line, of, the, present, sweet, water, canal, but, none, lasted, for, long, the, suez, canal, was, opened, in, november, 1869, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, red, sea, slave, trade, attracted, substantional, international, condemnation, after, the, second, world, war, the, americans, and, soviets, exerted, their, influence, whilst, the, volume, of, oil, tanker, traffic, intensified, however, the, six, day, war, culminated, in, the, closure, of, the, suez, canal, from, 1967, to, 1975, today, in, spite, of, patrols, by, the, major, maritime, fleets, in, the, waters, of, the, red, sea, the, suez, canal, has, never, recovered, its, supremacy, over, the, cape, route, which, is, believed, to, be, less, vulnerable, to, piracy, iranian, backed, yemini, houthis, have, attacked, western, ships, including, warships, during, the, 2023, 2024, israel, hamas, war, one, ship, was, hijacked, and, taken, back, to, yemen, the, red, sea, is, between, arid, land, desert, and, semi, desert, reef, systems, are, better, developed, along, the, red, sea, mainly, because, of, its, greater, depths, and, an, efficient, water, circulation, pattern, the, red, sea, water, mass, exchanges, its, water, with, the, arabian, sea, indian, ocean, via, the, gulf, of, aden, these, physical, factors, reduce, the, effect, of, high, salinity, caused, by, evaporation, in, the, north, and, relatively, hot, water, in, the, south, the, climate, of, the, red, sea, is, the, result, of, two, monsoon, seasons, a, northeasterly, monsoon, and, a, southwesterly, monsoon, monsoon, winds, occur, because, of, differential, heating, between, the, land, and, the, sea, very, high, surface, temperatures, and, high, salinities, make, this, one, of, the, warmest, and, saltiest, bodies, of, seawater, in, the, world, the, average, surface, water, temperature, of, the, red, sea, during, the, summer, is, about, 26, c, 79, f, in, the, north, and, 30, c, 86, f, in, the, south, with, only, about, 2, c, 3, 6, f, variation, during, the, winter, months, the, overall, average, water, temperature, is, 22, c, 72, f, temperature, and, visibility, remain, good, to, around, 200, m, 660, ft, the, sea, is, known, for, its, strong, winds, and, unpredictable, local, currents, the, rainfall, over, the, red, sea, and, its, coasts, is, extremely, low, averaging, 60, mm, 2, 36, in, per, year, the, rain, is, mostly, short, showers, often, with, thunderstorms, and, occasionally, with, dust, storms, the, scarcity, of, rainfall, and, no, major, source, of, fresh, water, to, the, red, sea, result, in, excess, evaporation, as, high, as, 2, 050, mm, 81, in, per, year, and, high, salinity, with, minimal, seasonal, variation, a, recent, underwater, expedition, to, the, red, sea, offshore, from, sudan, and, eritrea, found, surface, water, temperatures, 28, c, 82, f, in, winter, and, up, to, 34, c, 93, f, in, the, summer, but, despite, that, extreme, heat, the, coral, was, healthy, with, much, fish, life, with, very, little, sign, of, coral, bleaching, with, only, 9, infected, by, thalassomonas, loyana, the, white, plague, agent, favia, favus, coral, there, harbours, a, virus, ba3, which, kills, t, loyana, scientists, are, investigating, the, unique, properties, of, these, coral, and, their, commensal, algae, to, see, if, they, can, be, used, to, salvage, bleached, coral, elsewhere, the, red, sea, is, one, of, the, saltiest, bodies, of, water, in, the, world, owing, to, high, evaporation, and, low, precipitation, no, significant, rivers, or, streams, drain, into, the, sea, and, its, southern, connection, to, the, gulf, of, aden, an, arm, of, the, indian, ocean, is, narrow, its, salinity, ranges, from, between, 36, in, the, southern, part, and, 41, in, the, northern, part, around, the, gulf, of, suez, with, an, average, of, 40, average, salinity, for, the, world, s, seawater, is, 35, on, the, practical, salinity, scale, or, psu, that, translates, to, 3, 5, of, actual, dissolved, salts, in, general, tide, ranges, between, 0, 6, m, 2, 0, ft, in, the, north, near, the, mouth, of, the, gulf, of, suez, and, 0, 9, m, 3, 0, ft, in, the, south, near, the, gulf, of, aden, but, it, fluctuates, between, 0, 20, m, 0, 66, ft, and, 0, 30, m, 0, 98, ft, away, from, the, nodal, point, the, central, red, sea, jeddah, area, is, therefore, almost, tideless, and, as, such, the, annual, water, level, changes, are, more, significant, because, of, the, small, tidal, range, the, water, during, high, tide, inundates, the, coastal, sabkhas, as, a, thin, sheet, of, water, up, to, a, few, hundred, metres, rather, than, flooding, the, sabkhas, through, a, network, of, channels, however, south, of, jeddah, in, the, shoiaba, area, the, water, from, the, lagoon, may, cover, the, adjoining, sabkhas, as, far, as, 3, km, 2, mi, whereas, north, of, jeddah, in, the, al, kharrar, area, the, sabkhas, are, covered, by, a, thin, sheet, of, water, as, far, as, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, the, prevailing, north, and, northeast, winds, influence, the, movement, of, water, in, the, coastal, inlets, to, the, adjacent, sabkhas, especially, during, storms, winter, mean, sea, level, is, 0, 5, m, 1, 6, ft, higher, than, in, summer, tidal, velocities, passing, through, constrictions, caused, by, reefs, sand, bars, and, low, islands, commonly, exceed, 1, 2, m, s, 3, 7, ft, s, coral, reefs, in, the, red, sea, are, near, egypt, eritrea, israel, saudi, arabia, and, sudan, detailed, information, regarding, current, data, is, lacking, partially, because, the, currents, are, weak, and, both, spatially, and, temporally, variable, the, variation, of, temporal, and, spatial, currents, is, as, low, as, 0, 5, m, 1, 6, ft, and, are, governed, all, by, wind, during, the, summer, northwesterly, winds, drive, surface, water, south, for, about, four, months, at, a, velocity, of, 15, 20, cm, s, 6, 8, in, s, whereas, in, winter, the, flow, is, reversed, resulting, in, the, inflow, of, water, from, the, gulf, of, aden, into, the, red, sea, the, net, value, of, the, latter, predominates, resulting, in, an, overall, drift, to, the, north, end, of, the, red, sea, generally, the, velocity, of, the, tidal, current, is, 50, 60, cm, s, 20, 24, in, s, with, a, maximum, of, 1, m, s, 3, 3, ft, s, at, the, mouth, of, the, al, kharrar, lagoon, however, the, range, of, the, north, northeast, current, along, the, saudi, coast, is, 8, 29, cm, s, 3, 11, in, s, the, north, part, of, the, red, sea, is, dominated, by, persistent, north, west, winds, with, speeds, ranging, between, 7, km, h, 4, 3, mph, and, 12, km, h, 7, 5, mph, the, rest, of, the, red, sea, and, the, gulf, of, aden, are, subjected, to, regular, and, seasonally, reversible, winds, the, wind, regime, is, characterized, by, seasonal, and, regional, variations, in, speed, and, direction, with, average, speed, generally, increasing, northward, wind, is, the, driving, force, in, the, red, sea, to, transport, material, as, suspension, or, as, bedload, wind, induced, currents, play, an, important, role, in, the, red, sea, in, resuspending, bottom, sediments, and, transferring, materials, from, sites, of, dumping, to, sites, of, burial, in, quiescent, environment, of, deposition, wind, generated, current, measurement, is, therefore, important, in, order, to, determine, the, sediment, dispersal, pattern, and, its, role, in, the, erosion, and, accretion, of, the, coastal, rock, exposure, and, the, submerged, coral, beds, the, red, sea, was, formed, by, the, arabian, peninsula, being, split, from, the, horn, of, africa, by, movement, of, the, red, sea, rift, this, split, started, in, the, eocene, and, accelerated, during, the, oligocene, the, sea, is, still, widening, in, 2005, following, a, three, week, period, of, tectonic, activity, it, had, grown, by, 8, m, and, it, is, considered, that, it, will, become, an, ocean, in, time, as, proposed, in, the, model, of, john, tuzo, wilson, in, 1949, a, deep, water, survey, reported, anomalously, hot, brines, in, the, central, portion, of, the, red, sea, later, work, in, the, 1960s, confirmed, the, presence, of, hot, 60, c, 140, f, saline, brines, and, associated, metalliferous, muds, the, hot, solutions, were, emanating, from, an, active, subseafloor, rift, lake, asal, in, djibouti, is, eligible, as, an, experimental, site, to, study, the, evolution, of, the, deep, hot, brines, of, the, red, sea, by, observing, the, strontium, isotope, composition, of, the, red, sea, brines, it, is, possible, to, deduce, how, these, salt, waters, found, at, the, bottom, of, the, red, sea, could, have, evolved, in, a, similar, way, to, lake, asal, which, ideally, represents, their, compositional, extreme, the, high, salinity, of, the, waters, was, not, hospitable, to, living, organisms, sometime, during, the, tertiary, period, the, bab, el, mandeb, closed, and, the, red, sea, evaporated, to, an, empty, hot, dry, salt, floored, sink, effects, causing, this, would, have, been, a, number, of, volcanic, islands, rise, from, the, center, of, the, sea, most, are, dormant, however, in, 2007, jabal, al, tair, island, in, the, bab, el, mandeb, strait, erupted, violently, two, new, islands, were, formed, in, 2011, and, 2013, in, the, zubair, archipelago, a, small, chain, of, islands, owned, by, yemen, the, first, island, sholan, island, emerged, in, an, eruption, in, december, 2011, the, second, island, jadid, emerged, in, september, 2013, approximately, 40, of, the, red, sea, is, quite, shallow, at, less, than, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, with, about, 25, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, deep, undiscovered, oil, reserves, in, the, region, have, been, estimated, at, 5, 041, mmbo, undiscovered, gas, reserves, in, the, region, have, been, estimated, at, 112, 349, bcfg, undiscovered, natural, gas, reserves, have, been, estimated, at, 3, 077, mmbngl, most, of, these, plays, are, controlled, by, the, structure, of, the, basin, normal, faults, are, common, as, the, red, sea, occupies, an, active, diverging, margin, these, targets, are, commonly, found, below, the, salt, deposits, of, the, middle, miocene, modern, development, is, focused, on, the, following, fields, the, durwara, 2, field, was, discovered, in, 1963, while, the, suakin, 1, field, and, the, bashayer, 1a, field, were, discovered, in, 1976, on, the, egyptian, side, of, the, red, sea, the, barqan, field, was, discovered, in, 1969, and, the, midyan, field, in, 1992, both, within, the, midyan, basin, on, the, saudi, arabian, side, of, the, red, sea, the, 20, m, thick, middle, miocene, maqna, formation, is, an, oil, source, rock, in, the, basin, oil, seeps, occur, near, the, farasan, islands, the, dahlak, archipelago, along, the, coast, of, eritrea, and, in, the, southeastern, red, sea, along, the, coasts, of, saudi, arabia, and, yemen, in, terms, of, mineral, resources, the, major, constituents, of, the, red, sea, sediments, are, as, follows, the, red, sea, is, a, rich, and, diverse, ecosystem, for, example, more, than, 1200, fish, species, have, been, recorded, in, the, red, sea, of, which, 10, are, endemic, found, nowhere, else, since, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, november, 1869, over, a, thousand, marine, species, from, the, red, sea, from, plankton, seaweeds, invertebrates, to, fishes, have, migrated, northward, and, settled, in, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, point, that, a, number, of, them, now, form, a, significant, component, of, the, mediterranean, ecosystem, the, resulting, change, in, biodiversity, without, precedent, in, human, memory, is, currently, accelerating, in, particular, for, fishes, according, to, surveys, engaged, by, the, mediterranean, science, commission, the, rich, diversity, of, the, red, sea, is, in, part, due, to, the, 2, 000, km, 1, 240, mi, of, coral, reef, extending, along, its, coastline, these, fringing, reefs, are, 5000, 7000, years, old, and, are, largely, formed, of, stony, acropora, and, porites, corals, the, reefs, form, platforms, and, sometimes, lagoons, along, the, coast, and, occasional, other, features, such, as, cylinders, such, as, the, blue, hole, red, sea, at, dahab, the, red, sea, also, hosts, many, offshore, reefs, including, several, true, atolls, many, of, the, unusual, offshore, reef, formations, defy, classic, i, e, darwinian, coral, reef, classification, schemes, and, are, generally, attributed, to, the, high, levels, of, tectonic, activity, that, characterize, the, area, both, offshore, and, coastal, reefs, are, visited, by, pelagic, species, of, fish, including, many, of, the, 44, recorded, species, of, shark, and, by, many, species, over, 175, of, nudibranch, many, of, which, are, endemic, to, the, red, sea, other, coastal, red, sea, habitats, include, sea, grass, beds, salt, pans, mangrove, and, salt, marsh, furthermore, the, deep, red, sea, brine, pools, have, been, extensively, studied, with, regard, to, their, microbial, life, characterized, by, its, diversity, and, adaptation, to, extreme, environments, the, high, marine, biodiversity, of, the, area, is, recognized, by, the, egyptian, government,
