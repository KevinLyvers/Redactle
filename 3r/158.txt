the, rio, grande, r, i, o, r, n, d, or, r, i, o, r, n, d, e, in, the, united, states, or, the, r, o, bravo, del, norte, in, mexico, spanish, pronunciation, also, known, as, p, osoge, in, tewa, and, t, ba, adi, in, navajo, is, one, of, the, principal, rivers, along, with, the, colorado, river, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, in, northern, mexico, the, length, of, the, rio, grande, is, 1, 896, miles, 3, 051, km, making, it, the, 4th, longest, river, in, the, united, states, and, in, north, america, by, main, stem, it, originates, in, south, central, colorado, in, the, united, states, and, flows, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, rio, grande, drainage, basin, watershed, has, an, area, of, 182, 200, square, miles, 472, 000, km, 2, however, the, endorheic, basins, that, are, adjacent, to, and, within, the, greater, drainage, basin, of, the, rio, grande, increase, the, total, drainage, basin, area, to, 336, 000, square, miles, 870, 000, km, 2, the, rio, grande, with, its, fertile, valley, along, with, its, tributaries, is, a, vital, water, source, for, seven, us, and, mexican, states, and, flows, primarily, through, arid, and, semi, arid, lands, after, traversing, the, length, of, new, mexico, the, rio, grande, becomes, the, mexico, united, states, border, between, the, u, s, state, of, texas, and, the, northern, mexican, states, of, chihuahua, and, coahuila, nuevo, le, n, and, tamaulipas, a, short, segment, of, the, rio, grande, is, a, partial, state, boundary, between, the, u, s, states, of, new, mexico, and, texas, since, the, mid, twentieth, century, only, 20, percent, of, the, rio, grande, s, water, reaches, the, gulf, of, mexico, because, of, the, voluminous, consumption, of, water, required, to, irrigate, farmland, e, g, the, mesilla, and, lower, rio, grande, valleys, and, to, continually, hydrate, cities, e, g, albuquerque, such, water, usages, are, additional, to, the, reservoirs, of, water, retained, with, diversion, dams, 260, miles, 418, km, of, the, river, in, new, mexico, and, texas, are, designated, as, the, rio, grande, wild, and, scenic, river, the, rio, grande, rises, in, the, western, part, of, the, rio, grande, national, forest, in, the, u, s, state, of, colorado, and, is, formed, by, the, joining, of, several, streams, at, the, base, of, canby, mountain, in, the, san, juan, mountains, due, east, of, the, continental, divide, of, the, americas, from, the, continental, divide, the, rio, grande, flows, through, the, san, luis, valley, then, south, into, new, mexico, and, passes, through, the, rio, grande, gorge, near, taos, then, toward, espa, ola, afterwards, collecting, additional, waters, from, the, colorado, river, basin, via, the, san, juan, chama, diversion, project, and, from, the, rio, chama, the, rio, grande, then, continues, southwards, irrigating, the, farmlands, in, the, middle, rio, grande, valley, through, the, desert, cities, of, albuquerque, and, las, cruces, in, new, mexico, to, el, paso, texas, and, ciudad, ju, rez, chihuahua, in, mexico, in, the, albuquerque, metropolitan, area, the, rio, grande, flows, by, historic, pueblo, villages, such, as, sandia, pueblo, and, isleta, pueblo, south, of, el, paso, the, rio, grande, is, the, national, border, between, the, u, s, and, mexico, the, segment, of, the, river, that, forms, the, international, border, ranges, from, 889, to, 1, 248, miles, 1, 431, to, 2, 008, km, depending, on, how, the, river, is, measured, the, rio, conchos, is, a, major, tributary, of, the, rio, grande, with, its, confluence, 310, km, 193, straight, air, miles, southeast, of, el, paso, near, ojinaga, in, chihuahua, mexico, downstream, other, tributaries, include, the, pecos, river, and, devils, river, both, entering, the, rio, grande, from, the, north, in, the, vicinity, of, amistad, reservoir, in, texas, and, the, rio, salado, and, rio, san, juan, both, entering, from, the, south, with, confluences, in, tamaulipas, mexico, the, rio, grande, rises, in, high, mountains, and, flows, for, much, of, its, length, at, high, elevation, the, valley, floor, at, albuquerque, is, 5, 312, feet, 1, 619, m, and, el, paso, 3, 762, feet, 1, 147, m, above, sea, level, in, new, mexico, the, river, flows, through, the, rio, grande, rift, from, one, sediment, filled, basin, to, another, cutting, canyons, between, the, basins, and, supporting, a, fragile, bosque, ecosystem, on, its, flood, plain, from, albuquerque, southward, the, river, flows, through, desert, although, irrigated, agriculture, exists, throughout, most, of, its, stretch, it, is, particularly, extensive, in, the, subtropical, lower, rio, grande, valley, the, river, ends, in, a, small, sandy, delta, at, the, gulf, of, mexico, during, portions, of, 2001, and, 2002, the, mouth, of, the, rio, grande, was, blocked, by, a, sandbar, in, the, fall, of, 2003, the, sandbar, was, cleared, by, high, river, flows, around, 7, 063, cubic, feet, per, second, 200, m, 3, s, the, rio, grande, flows, through, a, valley, with, diverse, animal, and, plants, communities, conservation, of, the, river, and, the, valley, is, a, recurring, theme, for, people, who, live, in, the, region, although, the, river, s, greatest, depth, is, 60, feet, 18, m, the, rio, grande, generally, cannot, be, navigated, by, passenger, riverboats, or, by, cargo, barges, navigation, is, only, possible, near, the, mouth, of, the, river, in, rare, circumstances, up, to, laredo, texas, navigation, was, active, during, much, of, the, 19th, century, with, over, 200, different, steamboats, operating, between, the, river, s, mouth, close, to, brownsville, and, rio, grande, city, texas, many, steamboats, from, the, ohio, and, mississippi, rivers, were, requisitioned, by, the, u, s, government, and, moved, to, the, rio, grande, during, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1846, they, provided, transport, for, the, u, s, army, under, general, zachary, taylor, to, invade, monterrey, nuevo, le, n, via, camargo, municipality, tamaulipas, army, engineers, recommended, that, with, small, improvements, the, river, could, easily, be, made, navigable, as, far, north, as, el, paso, those, recommendations, were, never, acted, upon, the, brownsville, matamoros, international, bridge, a, large, swing, bridge, dates, back, to, 1910, and, is, still, in, use, today, by, automobiles, connecting, brownsville, with, matamoros, tamaulipas, the, swing, mechanism, has, not, been, used, since, the, early, 1900s, though, when, the, last, of, the, big, steamboats, disappeared, at, one, point, the, bridge, also, had, rail, traffic, railroad, trains, no, longer, use, this, bridge, a, new, rail, bridge, west, rail, international, crossing, connecting, the, u, s, and, mexico, was, built, about, 15, miles, west, of, the, brownsville, matamoros, international, bridge, it, was, inaugurated, in, august, 2015, it, moved, all, rail, operations, out, of, downtown, brownsville, and, matamoros, the, west, rail, international, crossing, is, the, first, new, international, rail, crossing, between, the, u, s, and, mexico, in, over, a, century, the, brownsville, matamoros, international, bridge, is, now, operated, by, the, brownsville, and, matamoros, bridge, company, a, joint, venture, between, the, mexican, government, and, the, union, pacific, railroad, at, the, mouth, of, the, rio, grande, on, the, mexican, side, was, the, large, commercial, port, of, bagdad, tamaulipas, during, the, american, civil, war, this, was, the, only, legitimate, port, of, the, confederacy, european, warships, anchored, offshore, to, maintain, the, port, s, neutrality, and, managed, to, do, so, successfully, throughout, that, conflict, despite, occasional, stare, downs, with, blockading, ships, from, the, us, navy, it, was, a, shallow, draft, river, port, with, several, smaller, vessels, that, hauled, cargo, to, and, from, the, deeper, draft, cargo, ships, anchored, off, shore, these, deeper, draft, ships, could, not, cross, the, shallow, sandbar, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, the, port, s, commerce, was, european, military, supplies, in, exchange, for, bales, of, cotton, the, sedimentary, basins, forming, the, modern, rio, grande, valley, were, not, integrated, into, a, single, river, system, draining, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, until, relatively, recent, geologic, time, instead, the, basins, formed, by, the, opening, of, the, rio, grande, rift, were, initially, bolsons, with, no, external, drainage, and, a, central, playa, an, axial, river, existed, in, the, espanola, basin, as, early, as, 13, million, years, ago, reaching, the, santo, domingo, basin, by, 6, 9, million, years, ago, however, at, this, time, the, river, drained, into, a, playa, in, the, southern, albuquerque, basin, where, it, deposited, the, popotosa, formation, the, upper, reach, of, this, river, corresponded, to, the, modern, rio, chama, but, by, 5, million, years, ago, an, ancestral, rio, grande, draining, the, eastern, san, juan, mountains, had, joined, the, ancestral, rio, chama, the, ancestral, rio, grande, progressively, integrated, basins, to, the, south, reaching, the, mesilla, basin, by, 4, 5, million, years, and, the, palomas, basin, by, 3, 1, million, years, ago, forming, lake, palomas, river, capture, by, a, tributary, of, the, pecos, river, then, occurred, with, the, rio, grande, flowing, to, texas, by, 2, 06, million, years, and, finally, joining, the, pecos, river, 800, 000, years, ago, which, drained, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, volcanism, in, the, taos, plateau, reduced, drainage, from, the, san, luis, basin, until, a, spillover, event, 440, 000, years, ago, that, drained, lake, alamosa, forming, the, rio, grande, gorge, and, fully, reintegrated, the, san, luis, basin, into, the, rio, grande, watershed, archeological, sites, from, the, earliest, human, presence, in, the, rio, grande, valley, are, scarce, due, to, traditional, indigenous, nomadic, culture, pleistocene, and, holocene, river, incision, or, burial, under, the, holocene, floodplain, however, some, early, sites, are, preserved, on, west, mesa, on, the, west, side, of, the, rio, grande, near, albuquerque, these, include, folsom, sites, possibly, dating, from, around, 10, 800, to, 9, 700, bce, that, were, probably, short, term, sites, such, as, buffalo, kill, sites, preservation, is, better, in, flanking, basins, of, the, rio, grande, valley, where, numerous, folsom, sites, and, a, much, smaller, number, of, earlier, clovis, sites, have, been, identified, later, paleo, indian, groups, included, the, belen, and, cody, cultures, who, appear, to, have, taken, advantage, of, the, rio, grande, valley, for, seasonal, migrations, and, may, have, settled, more, permanently, in, the, valley, the, paleo, indian, cultures, gave, way, to, the, archaic, oshara, tradition, beginning, around, 5450, bce, the, oshara, began, cultivation, of, maize, between, 1750, and, 750, bce, and, their, settlements, became, larger, and, more, permanent, drought, induced, the, collapse, of, the, ancestral, puebloan, culture, at, chaco, canyon, and, elsewhere, across, the, four, corners, region, at, around, 1130, ce, this, led, to, a, mass, migration, of, the, ancestral, puebloans, to, the, rio, grande, and, other, more, fertile, valleys, of, the, southwest, competing, with, other, indigenous, communities, such, as, the, apache, with, territory, in, the, rio, grande, valley, this, led, to, decades, of, conflict, the, coalition, period, the, eventual, merging, of, cultures, and, the, establishment, of, most, of, the, tanoan, and, keresan, pueblos, of, the, rio, grande, valley, this, was, followed, by, the, classic, period, from, about, 1325, ce, to, 1600, ce, and, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, the, upper, rio, grande, valley, was, characterized, by, occasional, periods, of, extreme, drought, and, the, human, inhabitants, make, extensive, use, of, gridded, gardens, and, check, dams, to, stretch, the, uncertain, water, supply, in, 1519, a, spanish, naval, expedition, along, the, northeastern, coast, of, mexico, charted, the, mouths, of, several, rivers, including, the, rio, grande, in, 1536, the, rio, grande, appeared, for, the, first, time, on, a, map, of, new, spain, produced, by, a, royal, spanish, cartographer, in, the, autumn, of, 1540, a, military, expedition, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, led, by, francisco, v, squez, de, coronado, governor, of, nueva, galicia, reached, the, tiwa, pueblos, along, the, rio, grande, in, the, future, new, mexico, on, july, 12, 1598, don, juan, de, o, ate, y, salazar, established, the, new, spain, colony, of, santa, fe, de, nuevo, m, jico, at, the, new, village, of, san, juan, de, los, caballeros, adjacent, to, the, ohkay, owingeh, pueblo, at, the, confluence, of, the, rio, grande, and, the, r, o, chama, during, the, late, 1830s, and, early, 1840s, the, river, marked, the, disputed, border, between, mexico, and, the, nascent, republic, of, texas, mexico, marked, the, border, at, the, nueces, river, the, disagreement, provided, part, of, the, rationale, for, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1846, after, texas, had, been, admitted, as, a, new, state, since, 1848, the, rio, grande, has, marked, the, boundary, between, mexico, and, the, united, states, from, the, twin, cities, of, el, paso, texas, and, ciudad, ju, rez, chihuahua, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, as, such, crossing, the, river, was, the, escape, route, used, by, some, texan, slaves, to, seek, freedom, mexico, had, liberal, colonization, policies, and, had, abolished, slavery, in, 1828, in, 1899, after, a, gradual, change, to, the, river, position, a, channel, was, dug, for, flood, control, which, moved, the, river, creating, what, was, called, cordova, island, which, became, the, center, of, the, chamizal, dispute, resolving, the, dispute, took, many, years, and, resulted, in, a, 1909, combined, assassination, attempt, on, the, american, and, mexican, presidents, following, the, approval, of, the, rio, grande, project, by, federal, lawmakers, in, 1905, the, waters, of, the, rio, grande, were, to, be, divided, between, the, states, of, new, mexico, and, texas, based, on, their, respective, amount, of, irrigable, land, the, project, also, accorded, 60, 000, acre, feet, 74, million, cubic, meters, of, water, annually, to, mexico, in, response, to, the, country, s, demands, this, was, meant, to, put, an, end, to, the, many, years, of, disagreement, concerning, rights, to, the, river, s, flow, and, the, construction, of, a, dam, and, reservoir, at, various, location, on, the, river, between, the, agricultural, interests, of, the, mesilla, valley, and, those, of, el, paso, and, ju, rez, in, the, agreement, provisions, were, made, to, construct, elephant, butte, dam, on, public, lands, this, act, was, the, first, occurrence, of, congressionally, directed, allocation, of, an, interstate, river, although, new, mexico, would, not, achieve, statehood, till, 1912, following, the, admittance, of, new, mexico, into, the, union, the, increased, settlement, of, the, rio, grande, farther, north, in, colorado, and, near, albuquerque, the, 1938, rio, grande, compact, developed, primarily, because, of, the, necessary, repeal, of, the, rio, grande, embargo, among, other, issues, though, both, colorado, and, new, mexico, were, initially, eager, to, begin, negotiations, they, broke, down, over, whether, texas, should, be, allowed, to, join, negotiations, in, 1928, though, it, had, representatives, present, in, an, effort, to, avoid, litigation, of, the, matter, in, the, supreme, court, a, provisional, agreement, was, signed, in, 1929, which, stated, that, negotiations, would, resume, once, a, reservoir, was, built, on, the, new, mexico, colorado, state, line, the, construction, of, this, was, delayed, by, the, market, crash, of, 1929, with, negotiations, remaining, stagnant, texas, sued, new, mexico, over, the, issue, in, 1935, prompting, the, intervention, of, the, president, who, set, up, the, rio, grande, joint, investigation, the, findings, of, which, helped, lead, to, the, final, agreement, the, 1938, rio, grande, compact, provided, for, the, creation, of, a, compact, commission, the, creation, of, gaging, stations, along, the, river, to, ensure, flow, amounts, by, colorado, to, new, mexico, at, the, state, line, and, by, new, mexico, to, elephant, butte, reservoir, the, water, once, there, would, fall, under, the, regulation, of, the, rio, grande, project, which, would, guarantee, provision, to, texas, and, mexico, a, system, of, debits, and, credits, was, created, to, account, for, variations, in, the, water, provided, the, compact, remains, in, effect, today, though, it, has, been, amended, twice, in, 1944, the, us, and, mexico, signed, a, treaty, regarding, the, river, due, to, drought, conditions, which, have, prevailed, throughout, much, of, the, 21st, century, calls, for, a, reexamination, of, this, treaty, have, been, made, by, locals, in, new, mexico, mexico, and, texas, texas, being, the, state, with, the, least, amount, of, control, over, the, waterway, has, routinely, seen, an, under, provision, of, water, since, 1992, in, 1997, the, us, designated, the, rio, grande, as, one, of, the, american, heritage, rivers, two, portions, of, the, rio, grande, are, designated, national, wild, and, scenic, rivers, system, one, in, northern, new, mexico, and, the, other, in, texas, at, big, bend, national, park, in, mid, 2001, a, 328, foot, 100, m, wide, sandbar, formed, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, marking, the, first, time, in, recorded, history, that, the, rio, grande, failed, to, empty, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, sandbar, was, dredged, but, reformed, almost, immediately, spring, rains, the, following, year, flushed, the, reformed, sandbar, out, to, sea, but, it, returned, in, mid, 2002, by, late, 2003, the, river, once, again, reached, the, gulf, for, much, of, the, time, since, water, rights, were, introduced, in, the, 1890s, the, rio, grande, flowed, through, las, cruces, from, february, to, october, each, year, but, this, is, subject, to, climate, change, in, 2020, the, river, flowed, only, from, march, to, september, as, of, january, 2021, the, elephant, butte, irrigation, district, ebid, expected, that, water, shortages, would, mean, the, river, only, flows, through, las, cruces, from, june, through, july, the, water, shortages, are, affecting, the, local, ecosystem, and, endangering, species, including, cottonwood, trees, and, the, southwestern, willow, flycatcher, the, water, of, the, rio, grande, is, over, appropriated, that, is, more, users, for, the, water, exist, than, water, in, the, river, because, of, both, drought, and, overuse, the, section, from, las, cruces, downstream, through, ojinaga, frequently, runs, dry, and, was, recently, tagged, the, forgotten, river, by, those, wishing, to, bring, attention, to, the, river, s, deteriorated, condition, in, 2022, due, to, increasing, drought, and, water, use, the, water, debt, owed, to, texas, increased, from, 31, 000, acre, feet, to, over, 130, 000, acre, feet, since, 2021, despite, very, significant, efforts, that, were, done, on, the, river, this, year, to, keep, water, flowing, downstream, in, response, new, mexico, increased, its, program, offering, to, subsidize, farmers, who, fallow, their, fields, rather, than, planting, crops, which, uses, additional, water, the, city, of, albuquerque, shut, off, its, domestic, supply, diversion, and, switched, to, full, groundwater, pumping, in, 2021, additionally, in, 2022, work, began, on, el, vado, dam, during, which, it, is, unavailable, for, storage, reducing, system, capacity, by, about, 180, 000, acre, feet, mrgcd, has, requested, storage, of, native, water, downstream, at, abiquiu, reservoir, which, normally, only, stores, waters, imported, into, the, rio, grande, watershed, from, the, colorado, river, watershed, via, the, san, juan, chama, project, elephant, butte, reservoir, the, main, storage, reservoir, on, the, rio, grande, was, reported, at, 13, 1, of, capacity, as, of, may, 1, 2022, further, decreasing, to, only, 5, 9, full, by, november, 2021, nearly, a, year, later, in, october, 2022, the, reservoir, had, made, only, insignificant, rebounds, resting, at, 6, 4, of, capacity, in, late, july, 2022, due, to, extreme, drought, the, rio, grande, ran, dry, for, about, 50, miles, in, the, middle, rio, grande, valley, including, five, miles, in, albuquerque, the, first, time, it, had, done, so, in, over, 40, years, the, following, winter, the, basin, experienced, above, average, snowfall, leading, to, very, high, flows, in, the, river, in, spring, of, 2023, and, flooding, of, some, of, its, tributaries, including, the, jemez, and, pecos, rivers, by, that, summer, after, the, spring, runoff, had, concluded, and, due, to, a, failed, new, mexico, monsoon, season, and, record, high, temperatures, the, river, went, dry, in, albuquerque, for, a,
