park, the, unit, operates, a, rapid, response, patrol, with, bicycles, ambulances, and, an, all, terrain, vehicle, before, the, unit, was, established, in, 1975, municipal, ems, often, took, over, 30, minutes, to, respond, to, incidents, in, the, park, between, 1821, and, 1855, new, york, city, s, population, nearly, quadrupled, as, the, city, expanded, northward, up, manhattan, people, were, drawn, to, the, few, existing, open, spaces, mainly, cemeteries, for, passive, recreation, these, were, seen, as, escapes, from, the, noise, and, chaotic, life, in, the, city, which, at, the, time, was, almost, entirely, centered, on, lower, manhattan, the, commissioners, plan, of, 1811, the, outline, for, manhattan, s, modern, street, grid, included, several, smaller, open, spaces, but, not, central, park, as, such, john, randel, jr, had, surveyed, the, grounds, for, the, construction, of, intersections, within, the, modern, day, park, site, the, only, remaining, surveying, bolt, from, his, survey, is, embedded, in, a, rock, north, of, the, present, dairy, and, the, 66th, street, transverse, marking, the, location, where, west, 65th, street, would, have, intersected, sixth, avenue, by, the, 1840s, members, of, the, city, s, elite, were, publicly, calling, for, the, construction, of, a, new, large, park, in, manhattan, at, the, time, manhattan, s, seventeen, squares, comprised, a, combined, 165, acres, 67, ha, of, land, the, largest, of, which, was, the, 10, acre, 4, ha, battery, park, at, manhattan, island, s, southern, tip, these, plans, were, endorsed, in, 1844, by, new, york, evening, post, editor, william, cullen, bryant, and, in, 1851, by, andrew, jackson, downing, one, of, the, first, american, landscape, designers, mayor, ambrose, kingsland, in, a, message, to, the, new, york, city, common, council, on, may, 5, 1851, set, forth, the, necessity, and, benefits, of, a, large, new, park, and, proposed, the, council, move, to, create, such, a, park, kingsland, s, proposal, was, referred, to, the, council, s, committee, of, lands, which, endorsed, the, proposal, the, committee, chose, jones, s, wood, a, 160, acre, 65, ha, tract, of, land, between, 66th, and, 75th, streets, on, the, upper, east, side, as, the, park, s, site, as, bryant, had, advocated, for, jones, wood, the, acquisition, was, controversial, because, of, its, location, small, size, relative, to, other, potential, uptown, tracts, and, cost, a, bill, to, acquire, jones, s, wood, was, invalidated, as, unconstitutional, so, attention, turned, to, a, second, site, a, 750, acre, 300, ha, area, known, as, central, park, bounded, by, 59th, and, 106th, streets, between, fifth, and, eighth, avenues, croton, aqueduct, board, president, nicholas, dean, who, proposed, the, central, park, site, chose, it, because, the, croton, aqueduct, s, 35, acre, 14, ha, 150, million, us, gallon, 570, 10, 6, l, collecting, reservoir, would, be, in, the, geographical, center, in, july, 1853, the, new, york, state, legislature, passed, the, central, park, act, authorizing, the, purchase, of, the, present, day, site, of, central, park, the, board, of, land, commissioners, conducted, property, assessments, on, more, than, 34, 000, lots, in, the, area, completing, them, by, july, 1855, while, the, assessments, were, ongoing, proposals, to, downsize, the, plans, were, vetoed, by, mayor, fernando, wood, at, the, time, the, site, was, occupied, by, free, black, people, and, irish, immigrants, who, had, developed, a, property, owning, community, there, since, 1825, most, of, the, central, park, site, s, residents, lived, in, small, villages, such, as, pigtown, seneca, village, or, in, the, school, and, convent, at, mount, st, vincent, s, academy, clearing, began, shortly, after, the, land, commission, s, report, was, released, in, october, 1855, and, approximately, 1, 600, residents, were, evicted, under, eminent, domain, though, supporters, claimed, that, the, park, would, cost, just, 1, 7, million, the, total, cost, of, the, land, ended, up, being, 7, 39, million, equivalent, to, 242, million, in, 2023, more, than, the, price, that, the, united, states, would, pay, for, alaska, a, few, years, later, in, june, 1856, fernando, wood, appointed, a, consulting, board, of, seven, people, headed, by, author, washington, irving, to, inspire, public, confidence, in, the, proposed, development, wood, hired, military, engineer, egbert, ludovicus, viele, as, the, park, s, chief, engineer, tasking, him, with, a, topographical, survey, of, the, site, the, following, april, the, state, legislature, passed, a, bill, to, authorize, the, appointment, of, four, democratic, and, seven, republican, commissioners, who, had, exclusive, control, over, the, planning, and, construction, process, though, viele, had, already, devised, a, plan, for, the, park, the, commissioners, disregarded, it, and, retained, him, to, complete, only, the, topographical, surveys, the, central, park, commission, began, hosting, a, landscape, design, contest, shortly, after, its, creation, the, commission, specified, that, each, entry, contain, extremely, detailed, specifications, as, mandated, by, the, consulting, board, thirty, three, firms, or, organizations, submitted, plans, in, april, 1858, the, park, commissioners, selected, frederick, law, olmsted, and, calvert, vaux, s, greensward, plan, as, the, winning, design, three, other, plans, were, designated, as, runners, up, and, featured, in, a, city, exhibit, unlike, many, of, the, other, designs, which, effectively, integrated, central, park, with, the, surrounding, city, olmsted, and, vaux, s, proposal, introduced, clear, separations, with, sunken, transverse, roadways, the, plan, eschewed, symmetry, instead, opting, for, a, more, picturesque, design, it, was, influenced, by, the, pastoral, ideals, of, landscaped, cemeteries, such, as, mount, auburn, in, cambridge, massachusetts, and, green, wood, in, brooklyn, the, design, was, also, inspired, by, olmsted, s, 1850, visit, to, birkenhead, park, in, birkenhead, england, which, is, generally, acknowledged, as, the, first, publicly, funded, civil, park, in, the, world, according, to, olmsted, the, park, was, of, great, importance, as, the, first, real, park, made, in, this, country, a, democratic, development, of, the, highest, significance, construction, of, central, park, s, design, was, executed, by, a, gamut, of, professionals, frederick, law, olmsted, and, calvert, vaux, were, the, primary, designers, assisted, by, board, member, andrew, haswell, green, architect, jacob, wrey, mould, master, gardener, ignaz, anton, pilat, and, engineer, george, e, waring, jr, olmsted, was, responsible, for, the, overall, plan, while, vaux, designed, some, of, the, finer, details, mould, who, worked, frequently, with, vaux, designed, the, central, park, esplanade, and, the, tavern, on, the, green, building, pilat, was, the, park, s, chief, landscape, architect, whose, primary, responsibility, was, the, importation, and, placement, of, plants, within, the, park, a, corps, of, construction, engineers, and, foremen, managed, by, superintending, engineer, william, h, grant, were, tasked, with, the, measuring, and, constructing, architectural, features, such, as, paths, roads, and, buildings, waring, was, one, of, the, engineers, working, under, grant, s, leadership, and, was, in, charge, of, land, drainage, central, park, was, difficult, to, construct, because, of, the, generally, rocky, and, swampy, landscape, around, five, million, cubic, feet, 140, 000, m, 3, of, soil, and, rocks, had, to, be, transported, out, of, the, park, and, more, gunpowder, was, used, to, clear, the, area, than, was, used, at, the, battle, of, gettysburg, during, the, american, civil, war, more, than, 18, 500, cubic, yards, 14, 100, m, 3, of, topsoil, were, transported, from, long, island, and, new, jersey, because, the, original, soil, was, neither, fertile, nor, sufficiently, substantial, to, sustain, the, flora, specified, in, the, greensward, plan, modern, steam, powered, equipment, and, custom, tree, moving, machines, augmented, the, work, of, unskilled, laborers, in, total, over, 20, 000, individuals, helped, construct, central, park, because, of, extreme, precautions, taken, to, minimize, collateral, damage, five, laborers, died, during, the, project, at, a, time, when, fatality, rates, were, generally, much, higher, during, the, development, of, central, park, superintendent, olmsted, hired, several, dozen, mounted, police, officers, who, were, classified, into, two, types, of, keepers, park, keepers, and, gate, keepers, the, mounted, police, were, viewed, favorably, by, park, patrons, and, were, later, incorporated, into, a, permanent, patrol, the, regulations, were, sometimes, strict, for, instance, prohibited, actions, included, games, of, chance, speech, making, large, congregations, such, as, picnics, or, picking, flowers, or, other, parts, of, plants, these, ordinances, were, effective, by, 1866, there, had, been, nearly, eight, million, visits, and, only, 110, arrests, in, the, park, s, history, in, late, august, 1857, workers, began, building, fences, clearing, vegetation, draining, the, land, and, leveling, uneven, terrain, by, the, following, month, chief, engineer, viele, reported, that, the, project, employed, nearly, 700, workers, olmsted, employed, workers, using, day, labor, hiring, men, directly, without, any, contracts, and, paying, them, by, the, day, many, of, the, laborers, were, irish, immigrants, or, first, or, second, generation, irish, americans, and, some, germans, and, italians, there, were, no, black, or, female, laborers, the, workers, were, often, underpaid, and, workers, would, often, take, jobs, at, other, construction, projects, to, supplement, their, income, a, pattern, of, seasonal, hiring, was, established, wherein, more, workers, would, be, hired, and, paid, at, higher, rates, during, the, summers, for, several, months, the, park, commissioners, faced, funding, issues, and, a, dedicated, workforce, and, funding, stream, was, not, secured, until, june, 1858, the, landscaped, upper, reservoir, was, the, only, part, of, the, park, that, the, commissioners, were, not, responsible, for, constructing, instead, the, reservoir, would, be, built, by, the, croton, aqueduct, board, work, on, the, reservoir, started, in, april, 1858, the, first, major, work, in, central, park, involved, grading, the, driveways, and, draining, the, land, in, the, park, s, southern, section, the, lake, in, central, park, s, southwestern, section, was, the, first, feature, to, open, to, the, public, in, december, 1858, followed, by, the, ramble, in, june, 1859, the, same, year, the, new, york, state, legislature, authorized, the, purchase, of, an, additional, 65, acres, 26, ha, at, the, northern, end, of, central, park, from, 106th, to, 110th, streets, the, section, of, central, park, south, of, 79th, street, was, mostly, completed, by, 1860, the, park, commissioners, reported, in, june, 1860, that, 4, million, had, been, spent, on, the, construction, to, date, as, a, result, of, the, sharply, rising, construction, costs, the, commissioners, eliminated, or, downsized, several, features, in, the, greensward, plan, based, on, claims, of, cost, mismanagement, the, new, york, state, senate, commissioned, the, swiss, engineer, julius, kellersberger, to, write, a, report, on, the, park, kellersberger, s, report, submitted, in, 1861, stated, that, the, commission, s, management, of, the, park, was, a, triumphant, success, olmsted, often, clashed, with, the, park, commissioners, notably, with, chief, commissioner, green, olmsted, resigned, in, june, 1862, and, green, was, appointed, to, olmsted, s, position, vaux, resigned, in, 1863, because, of, what, he, saw, as, pressure, from, green, as, superintendent, of, the, park, green, accelerated, construction, though, having, little, experience, in, architecture, he, implemented, a, style, of, micromanagement, keeping, records, of, the, smallest, transactions, in, an, effort, to, reduce, costs, green, finalized, the, negotiations, to, purchase, the, northernmost, 65, acres, 26, ha, of, the, park, which, was, later, converted, into, a, rugged, woodland, and, the, harlem, meer, waterway, when, the, american, civil, war, began, in, 1861, the, park, commissioners, decided, to, continue, building, central, park, since, significant, parts, of, the, park, had, already, been, completed, only, three, major, structures, were, completed, during, the, civil, war, the, music, stand, and, the, casino, restaurant, both, later, demolished, and, the, bethesda, terrace, and, fountain, by, late, 1861, the, park, south, of, 72nd, street, had, been, completed, except, for, various, fences, work, had, begun, on, the, northern, section, of, the, park, but, was, complicated, by, a, need, to, preserve, the, historic, mcgowan, s, pass, the, upper, reservoir, was, completed, the, following, year, during, this, period, central, park, began, to, gain, popularity, one, of, the, main, attractions, was, the, carriage, parade, a, daily, display, of, horse, drawn, carriages, that, traversed, the, park, park, patronage, grew, steadily, by, 1867, central, park, accommodated, nearly, three, million, pedestrians, 85, 000, horses, and, 1, 38, million, vehicles, annually, the, park, had, activities, for, new, yorkers, of, all, social, classes, while, the, wealthy, could, ride, horses, on, bridle, paths, or, travel, in, horse, drawn, carriages, almost, everyone, was, able, to, participate, in, sports, such, as, ice, skating, or, rowing, or, listen, to, concerts, at, the, mall, s, bandstand, olmsted, and, vaux, were, re, hired, in, mid, 1865, several, structures, were, erected, including, the, children, s, district, the, ballplayers, house, and, the, dairy, in, the, southern, part, of, central, park, construction, commenced, on, belvedere, castle, harlem, meer, and, structures, on, conservatory, water, and, the, lake, the, tammany, hall, political, machine, which, was, the, largest, political, force, in, new, york, at, the, time, was, in, control, of, central, park, for, a, brief, period, beginning, in, april, 1870, a, new, charter, created, by, tammany, boss, william, m, tweed, abolished, the, old, 11, member, commission, and, replaced, it, with, one, with, five, men, composed, of, green, and, four, other, tammany, connected, figures, subsequently, olmsted, and, vaux, resigned, again, from, the, project, in, november, 1870, after, tweed, s, embezzlement, was, publicly, revealed, in, 1871, leading, to, his, imprisonment, olmsted, and, vaux, were, re, hired, and, the, central, park, commission, appointed, new, members, who, were, mostly, in, favor, of, olmsted, one, of, the, areas, that, remained, relatively, untouched, was, the, underdeveloped, western, side, of, central, park, though, some, large, structures, would, be, erected, in, the, park, s, remaining, empty, plots, by, 1872, manhattan, square, had, been, reserved, for, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, founded, three, years, before, at, the, arsenal, a, corresponding, area, on, the, east, side, originally, intended, as, a, playground, would, later, become, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, the, final, years, of, central, park, s, construction, vaux, and, mould, designed, several, structures, for, central, park, the, park, s, sheepfold, now, tavern, on, the, green, and, ladies, meadow, were, designed, by, mould, in, 1870, 1871, followed, by, the, administrative, offices, on, the, 86th, street, transverse, in, 1872, even, though, olmsted, and, vaux, s, partnership, was, dissolved, by, the, end, of, 1872, the, park, was, not, officially, completed, until, 1876, by, the, 1870s, the, park, s, patrons, increasingly, came, to, include, the, middle, and, working, class, and, strict, regulations, were, gradually, eased, such, as, those, against, public, gatherings, because, of, the, heightened, visitor, count, neglect, by, the, tammany, administration, and, budget, cuts, demanded, by, taxpayers, the, maintenance, expenses, for, central, park, had, reached, a, nadir, by, 1879,

proper, the, park, has, three, scenic, drives, that, travel, through, it, vertically, they, have, multiple, traffic, lights, at, the, intersections, with, pedestrian, paths, although, there, are, some, arches, and, bridges, where, pedestrian, and, drive, traffic, can, cross, without, intersection, to, discourage, park, patrons, from, speeding, the, designers, incorporated, extensive, curves, in, the, park, drives, west, drive, is, the, westernmost, of, the, park, s, three, vertical, drives, the, road, which, carries, southbound, bicycle, and, horse, carriage, traffic, winds, through, the, western, part, of, central, park, connecting, lenox, avenue, central, park, north, with, seventh, avenue, central, park, south, and, central, drive, center, drive, also, known, as, the, central, park, lower, loop, connects, northbound, bicycle, and, carriage, traffic, from, midtown, at, central, park, south, sixth, avenue, to, east, drive, near, the, 66th, street, transverse, the, street, generally, goes, east, and, then, north, forming, the, bottom, part, of, the, central, park, loop, the, attractions, along, center, drive, include, victorian, gardens, the, central, park, carousel, and, the, central, park, mall, east, drive, the, easternmost, of, the, three, drives, connects, northbound, bicycle, and, carriage, traffic, from, midtown, to, the, upper, west, side, at, lenox, avenue, the, street, is, renowned, for, its, country, scenery, and, free, concerts, it, generally, straddles, the, east, side, of, the, park, along, fifth, avenue, the, drive, passes, by, the, central, park, zoo, around, 63rd, street, and, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, from, 80th, to, 84th, streets, unlike, the, rest, of, the, drive, system, which, is, generally, serpentine, east, drive, is, straight, between, the, 86th, and, 96th, street, transverses, because, it, is, between, fifth, avenue, and, the, jacqueline, kennedy, onassis, reservoir, east, drive, is, known, as, the, elite, carriage, parade, because, it, was, where, the, carriage, procession, occurred, at, the, time, of, the, park, s, opening, and, because, only, five, percent, of, the, city, was, able, to, afford, the, carriage, in, the, late, 19th, century, west, and, east, drives, were, popular, places, for, carriage, rides, two, other, scenic, drives, cross, the, park, horizontally, terrace, drive, is, at, 72nd, street, and, connects, west, and, east, drives, passing, over, bethesda, terrace, and, fountain, the, 102nd, street, crossing, further, north, near, the, street, of, the, same, name, is, a, former, carriage, drive, connecting, west, and, east, drives, in, central, park, s, earliest, years, the, speed, limits, were, set, at, 5, miles, per, hour, 8, 0, km, h, for, carriages, and, 6, mph, 9, 7, km, h, for, horses, which, were, later, raised, to, 7, and, 10, mph, 11, and, 16, km, h, respectively, commercial, vehicles, and, buses, were, banned, from, the, park, automobiles, became, more, common, in, central, park, during, the, 1900s, and, 1910s, and, they, often, broke, the, speed, limits, resulting, in, crashes, to, increase, safety, the, gravel, roads, were, paved, in, 1912, and, the, carriage, speed, limit, was, raised, to, 15, mph, 24, km, h, two, years, later, with, the, proliferation, of, cars, among, the, middle, class, in, the, 1920s, traffic, increased, on, the, drives, to, as, many, as, eight, thousand, cars, per, hour, in, 1929, the, roads, were, still, dangerous, in, the, first, ten, months, of, 1929, eight, people, were, killed, and, 249, were, injured, in, 338, separate, collisions, in, november, 1929, the, scenic, drives, were, converted, from, two, way, traffic, to, unidirectional, traffic, further, improvements, were, made, in, 1932, when, forty, two, traffic, lights, were, installed, along, the, scenic, drives, and, the, speed, limit, was, lowered, to, 25, miles, per, hour, 40, km, h, the, signals, were, coordinated, so, that, drivers, could, go, through, all, of, the, green, lights, if, they, maintained, a, steady, speed, of, 25, miles, per, hour, 40, km, h, the, drives, were, experimentally, closed, to, automotive, traffic, on, weekends, beginning, in, 1967, for, exclusive, use, by, pedestrians, and, bicyclists, in, subsequent, years, the, scenic, drives, were, closed, to, automotive, traffic, for, most, of, the, day, during, the, summer, by, 1979, the, drives, were, only, open, during, rush, hours, and, late, evenings, during, the, summer, legislation, was, proposed, in, october, 2014, to, conduct, a, study, to, make, the, park, car, free, in, summer, 2015, in, 2015, mayor, bill, de, blasio, announced, the, permanent, closure, of, west, and, east, drives, north, of, 72nd, street, to, vehicular, traffic, as, it, was, proven, that, closing, the, roads, did, not, adversely, impact, traffic, after, most, of, the, central, park, loop, drives, were, closed, to, vehicular, traffic, the, city, performed, a, follow, up, study, the, city, found, that, west, drive, was, open, for, two, hours, during, the, morning, rush, period, and, was, used, by, an, average, of, 1, 050, vehicles, a, day, while, east, drive, was, open, 12, hours, a, day, and, was, used, by, an, average, of, 3, 400, vehicles, daily, subsequently, all, cars, were, banned, from, east, drive, in, january, 2018, in, april, 2018, de, blasio, announced, that, the, entirety, of, the, three, loop, drives, would, be, closed, permanently, to, traffic, the, closure, was, put, into, effect, in, june, 2018, during, the, early, 21st, century, there, were, numerous, collisions, in, central, park, involving, cyclists, the, 2014, death, of, jill, tarlov, after, she, was, hit, by, a, cyclist, on, west, 63rd, street, called, attention, to, the, issue, in, 2011, residents, of, nearby, communities, unsuccessfully, petitioned, the, nypd, to, increase, enforcement, of, cycling, rules, within, the, park, in, the, mid, 20th, century, central, park, had, a, reputation, for, being, very, dangerous, especially, after, dark, such, a, viewpoint, was, reinforced, following, a, 1941, incident, when, 12, year, old, jerome, dore, fatally, stabbed, 15, year, old, james, o, connell, in, the, northern, section, of, the, park, local, tabloids, cited, this, incident, and, several, other, crimes, as, evidence, of, a, highly, exaggerated, crime, wave, though, recorded, crime, had, indeed, increased, since, central, park, opened, in, the, late, 1850s, this, was, in, line, with, crime, trends, seen, in, the, rest, of, the, city, central, park, s, reputation, for, crime, was, reinforced, by, its, worldwide, name, recognition, and, the, fact, that, crimes, in, the, park, were, covered, disproportionately, compared, to, crimes, in, the, rest, of, the, city, for, instance, in, 1973, the, new, york, times, wrote, stories, about, 20, of, murders, that, occurred, citywide, but, wrote, about, three, of, the, four, murders, that, took, place, in, central, park, that, year, by, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, number, of, murders, in, the, police, precincts, north, of, central, park, was, 18, times, higher, than, the, number, of, murders, within, the, park, itself, and, even, in, the, precincts, south, of, the, park, the, number, of, murders, was, three, times, as, high, the, park, was, the, site, of, numerous, high, profile, crimes, during, the, late, 20th, century, of, these, two, particularly, notable, cases, shaped, public, perception, against, the, park, in, 1986, robert, chambers, murdered, jennifer, levin, in, what, was, later, called, the, preppy, murder, three, years, later, an, investment, banker, was, raped, and, brutally, beaten, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, central, park, jogger, case, conversely, other, crimes, such, as, the, 1984, gang, rape, of, two, homeless, women, were, barely, reported, after, world, war, ii, it, was, feared, that, gay, men, perpetrated, sex, crimes, and, attracted, violence, other, problems, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, included, a, drug, epidemic, a, large, homeless, presence, vandalism, and, neglect, as, crime, has, declined, in, new, york, city, many, of, these, negative, perceptions, have, waned, safety, measures, keep, the, number, of, crimes, in, the, park, to, fewer, than, 100, per, year, as, of, 2019, down, from, approximately, 1, 000, in, the, early, 1980s, some, well, publicized, crimes, have, occurred, since, then, for, instance, on, june, 11, 2000, following, the, puerto, rican, day, parade, gangs, of, drunken, men, sexually, assaulted, women, in, the, park, permission, to, hold, issue, centered, rallies, in, central, park, similar, to, the, be, ins, of, the, 1960s, has, been, met, with, increasingly, stiff, resistance, from, the, city, during, some, 2004, protests, the, organization, united, for, peace, and, justice, wanted, to, hold, a, rally, on, the, great, lawn, during, the, republican, national, convention, the, city, denied, an, application, for, a, permit, stating, that, such, a, mass, gathering, would, be, harmful, to, the, grass, and, the, damage, would, make, it, harder, to, collect, private, donations, to, maintain, the, park, a, judge, of, the, new, york, supreme, court, s, new, york, county, branch, upheld, the, refusal, during, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, new, supertall, skyscrapers, were, constructed, along, the, southern, end, of, central, park, in, a, corridor, commonly, known, as, billionaires, row, according, to, a, municipal, art, society, report, such, buildings, cast, long, shadows, over, the, southern, end, of, the, park, a, 2016, analysis, by, the, new, york, times, found, that, some, of, the, tallest, and, skinniest, skyscrapers, such, as, one57, central, park, tower, and, 220, central, park, south, would, cast, shadows, that, can, be, as, much, as, 1, mile, 1, 6, km, long, during, the, winter, covering, up, to, a, third, of, the, park, s, length, in, 2018, the, new, york, city, council, proposed, a, task, force, to, study, the, effects, of, skyscrapers, near, city, parks, central, park, s, size, and, cultural, position, has, served, as, a, model, for, many, urban, parks, olmsted, believed, landscape, design, was, a, way, to, improve, the, feeling, of, community, and, had, intended, the, park, as, the, antithesis, of, the, stresses, of, the, city, s, daily, life, the, greensward, plan, radical, at, the, time, of, its, construction, led, to, widespread, changes, in, park, designs, and, urban, planning, in, particular, parks, were, designed, to, incorporate, landscapes, whose, elements, were, related, to, each, other, as, a, new, york, city, icon, central, park, is, one, of, the, most, filmed, locations, in, the, world, a, december, 2017, report, found, that, 231, movies, had, used, it, for, on, location, shoots, more, than, the, 160, movies, that, had, filmed, in, greenwich, village, or, the, 99, movies, that, had, filmed, in, times, square, some, of, the, movies, filmed, at, central, park, such, as, the, 1993, film, the, age, of, innocence, reflect, ideals, of, the, past, other, films, including, the, fisher, king, 1991, marathon, man, 1976, the, out, of, towners, 1970, and, home, alone, 2, lost, in, new, york, 1992, use, the, park, for, dramatic, conflict, scenes, central, park, has, been, used, in, romance, films, such, as, maid, in, manhattan, 2002, 13, going, on, 30, 2004, or, hitch, 2005, and, fantasy, live, action, animated, films, such, as, enchanted, 2007, in, 2009, an, estimated, 4, 000, days, of, film, shoots, were, hosted, or, an, average, of, more, than, ten, film, shoots, per, day, accounting, for, 135, 5, million, in, city, revenue, because, of, its, cultural, and, historical, significance, central, park, has, been, a, national, historic, landmark, since, 1962, and, a, new, york, city, scenic, landmark, since, 1974, it, was, placed, on, unesco, s, list, of, tentative, world, heritage, sites, in, 2017, the, value, of, the, surrounding, land, started, rising, significantly, in, the, mid, 1860s, during, the, park, s, construction, the, completion, of, central, park, immediately, increased, the, surrounding, area, s, real, estate, prices, in, some, cases, by, up, to, 700, percent, between, 1858, and, 1870, it, also, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, zoning, plan, in, upper, manhattan, upscale, districts, grew, on, both, sides, of, central, park, following, its, completion, on, the, upper, east, side, a, portion, of, fifth, avenue, abutting, lower, central, park, became, known, as, millionaires, row, by, the, 1890s, due, to, the, concentration, of, wealthy, families, in, the, area, the, upper, west, side, took, longer, to, develop, but, row, houses, and, luxury, apartment, buildings, came, to, predominate, the, neighborhood, and, some, were, later, included, in, the, central, park, west, historic, district, though, most, of, the, city, s, rich, formerly, lived, in, mansions, they, moved, into, apartments, close, to, central, park, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, during, the, late, 20th, century, until, central, park, s, restoration, in, the, 1990s, proximity, to, the, park, did, not, have, a, significant, positive, effect, on, real, estate, values, following, central, park, s, restoration, some, of, the, city, s, most, expensive, properties, have, been, sold, or, rented, near, the, park, the, value, of, the, land, in, central, park, was, estimated, to, be, about, 528, 8, billion, in, december, 2005, though, this, was, based, on, the, park, s, impact, on, the, average, value, of, nearby, land, in, the, modern, day, it, is, estimated, that, central, park, has, resulted, in, billions, of, dollars, in, economic, impact, a, 2009, study, found, that, the, city, received, annual, tax, revenue, of, more, than, 656, million, visitors, spent, more, than, 395, million, due, to, the, park, in, park, businesses, such, as, concessions, generated, 135, 5, million, and, the, 4, 000, hours, of, annual, film, shoots, and, other, photography, generated, 135, 6, million, of, economic, output, in, 2013, about, 550, 000, people, lived, within, a, ten, minute, walk, about, 0, 5, miles, or, 0, 80, kilometers, of, the, park, s, boundaries, and, 1, 15, million, more, people, could, get, to, the, park, within, a, half, hour, subway, ride
