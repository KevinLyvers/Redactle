from, proto, celtic, or, celtic, olisippo, lissoppo, or, a, similar, name, which, other, visiting, peoples, like, the, ancient, phoenicians, greeks, and, romans, adapted, accordingly, such, as, the, pre, roman, appellation, for, the, tagus, river, lisso, or, lucio, classical, authors, writing, in, latin, and, greek, including, strabo, solinus, and, martianus, capella, referred, to, popular, legends, that, the, city, of, lisbon, was, founded, by, the, mythical, hero, ulysses, odysseus, lisbon, s, name, was, written, ulyssippo, in, latin, by, the, geographer, pomponius, mela, a, native, of, hispania, it, was, later, referred, to, as, olisippo, by, pliny, the, elder, and, by, the, greeks, as, olissipo, or, olissipona, another, claim, repeated, in, literature, is, that, the, name, of, lisbon, could, be, traced, back, to, phoenician, times, referring, to, a, supposed, phoenician, term, alis, ubbo, meaning, safe, harbour, or, pleasant, haven, although, modern, archaeological, excavations, show, a, phoenician, presence, at, this, location, since, 1200, bc, this, folk, etymology, is, never, attested, in, ancient, classical, literature, lisbon, s, name, is, commonly, abbreviated, as, lx, or, lx, originating, in, an, antiquated, spelling, of, lisbon, as, lixb, a, while, the, old, spelling, has, since, been, completely, dropped, from, usage, and, goes, against, modern, language, standards, the, abbreviation, is, still, commonly, used, during, the, neolithic, period, the, region, was, inhabited, by, pre, celtic, tribes, who, built, religious, and, funerary, monuments, megaliths, dolmens, and, menhirs, which, still, survive, in, areas, on, the, periphery, of, lisbon, the, indo, european, celts, invaded, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, mixing, with, the, pre, indo, european, population, thus, giving, rise, to, celtic, speaking, local, tribes, such, as, the, cempsi, or, sefes, although, the, first, fortifications, on, lisbon, s, castelo, hill, are, known, to, be, no, older, than, the, 2nd, century, bc, recent, archaeological, finds, have, shown, that, iron, age, people, occupied, the, site, from, the, 8th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, this, indigenous, settlement, maintained, commercial, relations, with, the, phoenicians, which, would, account, for, the, recent, findings, of, phoenician, pottery, and, other, material, objects, archaeological, excavations, made, near, the, castle, of, s, o, jorge, castelo, de, s, o, jorge, and, lisbon, cathedral, indicate, a, phoenician, presence, at, this, location, since, 1200, bc, and, it, can, be, stated, with, confidence, that, a, phoenician, trading, post, stood, on, a, site, now, the, centre, of, the, present, city, on, the, southern, slope, of, the, castle, hill, the, sheltered, harbour, in, the, tagus, river, estuary, was, an, ideal, spot, for, an, iberian, settlement, and, would, have, provided, a, secure, harbour, for, unloading, and, provisioning, phoenician, ships, the, tagus, settlement, was, an, important, centre, of, commercial, trade, with, the, inland, tribes, providing, an, outlet, for, the, valuable, metals, salt, and, salted, fish, they, collected, and, for, the, sale, of, the, lusitanian, horses, renowned, in, antiquity, according, to, a, persistent, legend, the, location, was, named, for, the, mythical, ulysses, who, founded, the, city, when, he, sailed, westward, to, the, ends, of, the, known, world, following, the, defeat, of, hannibal, in, 202, bc, during, the, punic, wars, the, romans, determined, to, deprive, carthage, of,

europe, s, upper, classes, the, city, prospered, as, piracy, was, eliminated, and, technological, advances, were, introduced, consequently, felicitas, julia, became, a, center, of, trade, with, the,
