scientists, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, would, send, some, of, the, irtysh, s, and, possibly, ob, s, water, to, the, water, deficient, regions, of, central, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, some, versions, of, this, project, would, have, seen, the, direction, of, flow, of, the, irtysh, reversed, in, its, section, between, the, mouth, of, the, tobol, at, tobolsk, and, the, confluence, of, the, irtysh, with, the, ob, at, khanty, mansiysk, thus, creating, an, anti, irtysh, while, these, gigantic, interbasin, transfer, schemes, were, not, implemented, a, smaller, irtysh, karaganda, canal, was, built, between, 1962, and, 1974, to, supply, water, to, the, dry, kazakh, steppes, and, to, one, of, the, country, s, main, industrial, center, karaganda, in, 2002, pipelines, were, constructed, to, supply, water, from, the, canal, to, the, ishim, and, kazakhstan, s, capital, astana, in, china, a, short, canal, was, constructed, in, 1987, water, intake, at, 47, 26, 31, n, 87, 34, 11, e, 47,

irrigation, use, of, the, lake, s, main, affluent, the, ulungur, river, in, the, last, years, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, early, 2000s, a, much, more, major, project, the, irtysh, karamay, ur, mqi, canal, was, completed, increased, water, use, in, china, has, caused, significant, concerns, among, kazakh, and, russian, environmentalists, according, to, a, report, published, by, kazakhstan, fishery, researchers, in, 2013, the, total, irtysh, water, use, in, china, is, about, 3, cubic, kilometres, 0, 7, cu, mi, per, year, as, a, result, only, about, 2, 3, of, what, would, be, the, river,

the, lower, and, middle, courses, of, the, irtysh, lay, within, the, tatar, khanate, of, sibir, its, capital, qashliq, also, known, as, sibir, was, located, on, the, irtysh, a, few, kilometres, upstream, from, the, mouth, of, the, tobol, where, today, s, tobolsk, is, situated, the, khanate, of, sibir, was, conquered, by, the, russians, in, the, 1580s, the, russians, started, building, fortresses, and, towns, next, to, the, sites, of, former, tatar, towns, one, of, the, first, russian, towns, in, siberia, after, tyumen, was, tobolsk, founded, in, 1587, at, the, fall, of, the, tobol, into, the, irtysh, downstream, from, the, former, qashliq, farther, east, tara, was, founded, in, 1594, roughly, at, the, border, of, the, taiga, belt, to, the, north, and, the, steppe, to, the, south, in, the, 17th, century, the, dzungar, khanate, formed, by, the, mongol, oirat, people, became, russia, s, southern, neighbor, and, controlled, the, upper, irtysh, as, a, result, of, russia, s, confrontation, with, the, dzungars, in, the, peter, the, great, s, era, the, russians, founded, the, cities, of, omsk, in, 1716, semipalatinsk, in, 1718, ust, kamenogorsk, in, 1720, and, petropavlovsk, in, 1752, the, chinese, qing, empire, conquered, dzungaria, in, the, 1750s, this, prompted, an, increase, in, the, russian, authorities, attention, to, their, borderland, in, 1756, the, orenburg, governor, ivan, neplyuyev, even, proposed, the, annexation, of, the, lake, zaysan, region, but, this, project, was, forestalled, by, chinese, successes, concerns, were, raised, in, russia, 1759, about, the, theoretical, possibility, of, a, chinese, fleet, sailing, from, lake, zaysan, down, the, irtysh, and, into, western, siberia, a, russian, expedition, visited, lake, zaysan, in, 1764, and, concluded, that, such, a, riverine, invasion, would, not, be, likely, nonetheless, a, chain, of, russian, pickets, was, established, on, the, bukhtarma, river, north, of, lake, zaysan, thus, the, border, between, the, two, empires, in, the, irtysh, basin, became, roughly, delineated, with, a, sparse, chain, of, guard, posts, on, both, sides, the, situation, in, the, borderlands, in, the, mid, 19th, century, is, described, in, a, report, by, a, abramof, ru, 1865, even, though, the, zaysan, region, was, recognized, by, both, parties, as, part, of, the, qing, empire, it, had, been, annually, used, by, fishing, expeditions, sent, by, the, siberian, cossack, host, the, summer, expeditions, started, in, 1803, and, in, 1822, 25, their, range, was, expanded, through, the, entire, lake, zaysan, and, to, the, mouth, of, the, black, irtysh, through, the, mid, 19th, century, the, qing, presence, on, the, upper, irtysh, was, mostly, limited, to, the, annual, visit, of, the, qing, amban, from, chuguchak, to, one, of, the, cossacks, fishing, stations, batavski, piket, the, border, between, the, russian, and, the, qing, empires, in, the, irtysh, basin, was, established, along, the, line, fairly, similar, to, china, s, modern, border, with, russia, and, kazakhstan, by, the, convention, of, peking, of, 1860, the, actual, border, line, pursuant, to, the, convention, was, drawn, by, the, protocol, of, chuguchak, 1864, leaving, lake, zaysan, on, the, russian, side, the, qing, empire, s, military, presence, in, the, irtysh, basin, crumbled, during, the, 1862, 77, dungan, revolt, after, the, fall, of, the, rebellion, and, the, reconquest, of, xinjiang, by, zuo, zongtang, the, border, between, the, russian, and, the, qing, empires, in, the, irtysh, basin, was, further, slightly, readjusted, in, russia, s, favor, by, the, treaty, of, saint, petersburg, 1881, the, irtysh, river, serves, as, a, backdrop, in, the, epilogue, of, fyodor, dostoyevsky, s, 1866, novel, crime, and, punishment, in, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, s, the, gulag, archipelago, the, chapter, the, white, kitten, details, georgi, tenno, s, escape, from, a, camp, along, this, river
