shared, cultural, history, with, three, other, island, regions, maritime, southeast, asia, to, the, west, polynesia, to, the, east, and, melanesia, to, the, south, as, well, as, with, the, wider, community, of, austronesian, peoples, the, region, has, a, tropical, marine, climate, and, is, part, of, the, oceanian, realm, it, includes, four, main, archipelagos, the, caroline, islands, the, gilbert, islands, the, mariana, islands, and, the, marshall, islands, as, well, as, numerous, islands, that, are, not, part, of, any, archipelago, political, control, of, areas, within, micronesia, varies, depending, on, the, island, and, is, distributed, among, six, sovereign, nations, some, of, the, caroline, islands, are, part, of, the, republic, of, palau, and, some, are, part, of, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, often, shortened, to, fsm, or, micronesia, not, to, be, confused, with, the, identical, name, for, the, overall, region, the, gilbert, islands, along, with, the, phoenix, islands, and, the, line, islands, in, polynesia, comprise, the, republic, of, kiribati, the, mariana, islands, are, affiliated, with, the, united, states, some, of, them, belong, to, the, u,

belong, to, the, republic, of, the, marshall, islands, the, sovereignty, of, wake, island, is, contested, it, is, claimed, both, by, the, united, states, and, by, the, republic, of, the, marshall, islands, the, united, states, has, actual, possession, of, wake, island, which, is, under, the, immediate, administration, of, the, united, states, air, force, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, the, notion, of, micronesia, has, been, quite, well, established, since, 1832, and, has, been, used, ever, since, by, most, popular, works, this, set, does, not, correspond, to, any, geomorphological, archaeological, linguistic, ethnic, or, cultural, unity, but, on, the, contrary, represents, a, disparate, ensemble, with, no, real, deep, unity, in, fact, micronesian, people, does, not, exist, as, a, subset, of, the, sea, migrating, austronesian, people, who, may, also, include, the, polynesian, people, and, the, hypothetical, australo, melanesian, or, melanesian, people, human, settlement, of, micronesia, began, several, millennia, ago, based, on, the, current, scientific, consensus, the, austronesian, peoples, originated, from, a, prehistoric, seaborne, migration, known, as, the, austronesian, expansion, from, pre, han, formosa, at, around, 3000, to, 1500, bce, austronesians, reached, the, northernmost, philippines, specifically, the, batanes, islands, by, around, 2200, bce, austronesians, were, the, first, people, to, invent, oceangoing, sailing, technologies, notably, catamarans, outrigger, boats, lashed, lug, boat, building, and, the, crab, claw, sail, which, enabled, their, rapid, dispersal, into, the, islands, of, the, indo, pacific, from, 2000, bce, they, assimilated, or, were, assimilated, by, the, earlier, populations, on, the, islands, in, their, migration, pathway, the, earliest, known, contact, of, europeans, with, micronesia, was, in, 1521, when, magellan, expedition, landed, in, the, marianas, jules, dumont, d, urville, is, usually, credited, with, coining, the, term, micronesia, in, 1832, but, in, fact, louis, domeny, de, rienzi, used, this, term, a, year, earlier, micronesia, is, a, region, in, oceania, that, includes, approximately, 2100, islands, with, a, total, land, area, of, 2, 700, km, 2, 1, 000, sq, mi, the, largest, of, which, is, guam, which, covers, 582, km, 2, 225, sq, mi, the, total, ocean, area, within, the, perimeter, of, the, islands, is, 7, 400, 000, km, 2, 2, 900, 000, sq, mi, there, are, four, main, island, groups, in, micronesia, this, does, not, include, the, separate, island, nation, of, nauru, along, with, other, distinctly, separate, islands, and, smaller, island, groups, the, caroline, islands, are, a, widely, scattered, archipelago, consisting, of, about, 500, small, coral, islands, north, of, new, guinea, and, east, of, the, philippines, the, carolines, consist, of, two, nations, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, consisting, of, approximately, 600, islands, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, chain, with, kosrae, being, the, most, eastern, and, palau, consisting, of, 250, islands, on, the, western, side, the, gilbert, islands, are, a, chain, of, sixteen, atolls, and, coral, islands, arranged, in, an, approximate, north, to, south, line, in, a, geographical, sense, the, equator, serves, as, the, dividing, line, between, the, northern, gilbert, islands, and, the, southern, gilbert,

archipelago, made, up, by, the, summits, of, fifteen, volcanic, mountains, the, island, chain, arises, as, a, result, of, the, western, edge, of, the, pacific, plate, moving, westward, and, plunging, downward, below, the, mariana, plate, a, region, that, is, the, most, volcanically, active, convergent, plate, boundary, on, earth, the, marianas, were, politically, divided, in, 1898, when, the, united, states, acquired, title, to, guam, under, the, treaty, of, paris, 1898, which, ended, the, spanish, american, war, spain, then, sold, the, remaining, northerly, islands, to, germany, in, 1899, germany, lost, all, of, her, colonies, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, became, a, league, of, nations, mandate, with, japan, as, the, mandatory, after, world, war, ii, the, islands, were, transferred, into, the, united, nations, trust, territory, system, with, the, united, states, as, trustee, in, 1976, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, the, united, states, entered, into, a, covenant, of, political, union, under, which, commonwealth, status, was, granted, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, its, residents, received, united, states, citizenship, the, marshall, islands, are, located, north, of, nauru, and, kiribati, east, of, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, and, south, of, the, u, s, territory, of, wake, island, the, islands, consist, of, 29, low, lying, atolls, and, 5, isolated, islands, comprising, 1, 156, individual, islands, and, islets, the, atolls, and, islands, form, two, groups, the, ratak, chain, and, the, ralik, chain,

nuclear, tests, that, occurred, there, the, islands, are, composed, of, low, coral, limestone, and, sand, the, average, elevation, is, only, about, 2, 1, metres, 7, ft, above, low, tide, level, nauru, is, an, oval, shaped, island, country, in, the, southwestern, pacific, ocean, 42, km, 26, mi, south, of, the, equator, listed, as, the, world, s, smallest, republic, covering, just, 21, km, 2, 8, sq,

dotted, with, pinnacles, the, presence, of, the, reef, has, prevented, the, establishment, of, a, seaport, although, channels, in, the, reef, allow, small, boats, access, to, the, island, a, fertile, coastal, strip, 150, to, 300, m, 490, to, 980, ft, wide, lies, inland, from, the, beach, wake, island, is, a, coral, atoll, with, a, coastline, of, 19, km, 12, mi, just, north, of, the, marshall, islands, it, is, an, unorganized, unincorporated, territory, of, the, united, states, access, to, the, island, is, restricted, and, all, activities, on, the, island, are, managed, by, the, united, states, air, force, while, geographically, adjacent, it, is, not, ethnoculturally, part, of, micronesia, due, to, its, historical, lack, of, human, inhabitation, micronesians, may, have, possibly, visited, wake, island, in, prehistoric, times, to, harvest, fish, but, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, any, kind, of, settlement, the, majority, of, the, islands, in, the, area, are, part, of, a, coral, atoll, coral, atolls, begin, as, coral, reefs, that, grow, on, the, slopes, of, a, central, volcano, when, the, volcano, sinks, back, down, into, the, sea, the, coral, continues, to, grow, keeping, the, reef, at, or, above, water, level, one, exception, is, pohnpei, in, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, which, still, has, the, central, volcano, and, coral, reefs, around, it, the, yap, islands, host, a, number, of, endemic, bird, species, including, the, yap, monarch, and, the, olive, white, eye, in, addition, to, four, other, restricted, range, bird, species, the, endangered, yap, flying, fox, though, often, considered, a, subspecies, of, the, pelew, flying, fox, or, the, mariana, fruit, bat, is, also, endemic, to, yap, the, region, has, a, tropical, marine, climate, moderated, by, seasonal, northeast, trade, winds, there, is, little, seasonal, temperature, variation, the, dry, season, runs, from, december, or, january, to, june, and, the, rainy, season, from, july, to, november, or, december, because, of, the, location, of, some, islands, the, rainy, season, can, sometimes, include, typhoons, the, northern, mariana, islands, were, the, first, islands, in, oceania, colonized, by, the, austronesian, peoples, they, were, settled, by, the, voyagers, who, sailed, eastwards, from, the, philippines, in, approximately, 1500, bce, these, populations, gradually, moved, southwards, until, they, reached, the, bismarck, archipelago, and, the, solomon, islands, by, 1300, bce, and, reconnected, with, the, lapita, culture, of, the, southeast, migration, branch, of, austronesians, moving, through, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, by, 1200, bce, they, again, began, crossing, open, seas, beyond, inter, island, visibility, reaching, vanuatu, fiji, and, new, caledonia, before, continuing, eastwards, to, become, the, ancestors, of, the, polynesian, people, further, migrations, by, other, austronesians, also, followed, likely, from, sulawesi, settling, palau, and, yap, by, around, 1000, bce, the, details, of, this, colonization, however, are, not, very, well, known, in, 200, bce, a, loosely, connected, group, of, lapita, colonists, from, island, melanesia, also, migrated, back, northwards, settling, the, islands, of, eastern, micronesia, almost, simultaneously, this, region, became, the, center, of, another, wave, of, migrations, radiating, outwards, reconnecting, them, with, other, settled, islands, in, western, micronesia, around, 800, ce, a, second, wave, of, migrants, from, southeast, asia, arrived, in, the, marianas, beginning, what, is, now, known, as, the, latte, period, these, new, settlers, built, large, structures, with, distinctive, capped, stone, pillars, known, as, haligi, they, also, reintroduced, rice, which, did, not, survive, earlier, voyages, making, the, northern, marianas, the, only, islands, in, oceania, where, rice, was, grown, prior, to, european, contact, however, it, was, considered, a, high, status, crop, and, only, used, in, rituals, it, did, not, become, a, staple, until, after, spanish, colonization, construction, of, nan, madol, a, megalithic, complex, made, from, basalt, lava, logs, in, pohnpei, began, in, around, 1180, ce, this, was, followed, by, the, construction, of, the, leluh, complex, in, kosrae, in, around, 1200, the, earliest, known, contact, with, europeans, occurred, in, 1521, when, a, spanish, expedition, under, ferdinand, magellan, reached, the, marianas, this, contact, is, recorded, in, antonio, pigafetta, s, chronicle, of, magellan, s, voyage, in, which, he, recounts, that, the, chamorro, people, had, no, apparent, knowledge, of, people, outside, of, their, island, group, a, portuguese, account, of, the, same, voyage, suggests, that, the, chamorro, people, who, greeted, the, travellers, did, so, without, any, shyness, as, if, they, were, good, acquaintances, further, contact, was, made, during, the, sixteenth, century, although, often, initial, encounters, were, very, brief, documents, relating, to, the, 1525, voyage, of, diogo, da, rocha, suggest, that, he, made, the, first, european, contact, with, inhabitants, of, the, caroline, islands, possibly, staying, on, the, ulithi, atoll, for, four, months, and, encountering, yap, marshall, islanders, were, encountered, by, the, expedition, of, spanish, navigator, lvaro, de, saavedra, cer, n, in, 1529, other, contact, with, the, yap, islands, occurred, in, 1625, in, the, early, 17th, century, spain, colonized, guam, the, northern, marianas, and, the, caroline, islands, what, would, later, become, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, and, the, republic, of, palau, creating, the, spanish, east, indies, which, was, governed, from, the, spanish, philippines, when, russian, explorer, otto, von, kotzebue, visited, the, marshall, islands, in, 1817, he, noted, that, marshallese, families, practiced, infanticide, after, the, birth, of, a, third, child, as, a, form, of, population, planning, due, to, frequent, famines, in, 1819, the, american, board, of, commissioners, for, foreign, missions, a, protestant, group, brought, their, puritan, ways, to, polynesia, soon, after, the, hawaiian, missionary, society, was, founded, and, sent, missionaries, into, micronesia, conversion, was, not, met, with, as, much, opposition, as, the, local, religions, were, less, developed, at, least, according, to, western, ethnographic, accounts, in, contrast, it, took, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, to, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, centuries, for, missionaries, to, fully, convert, the, inhabitants, of, melanesia, however, a, comparison, of, the, cultural, contrast, must, take, into, account, the, fact, that, melanesia, has, always, had, deadly, strains, of, malaria, present, in, various, degrees, and, distributions, throughout, its, history, see, de, rays, expedition, and, up, to, the, present, conversely, micronesia, does, not, have, and, never, seems, to, have, had, any, malarial, mosquitos, nor, pathogens, on, any, of, its, islands, in, the, past, in, the, spanish, american, war, spain, lost, many, of, its, remaining, colonies, in, the, pacific, the, united, states, took, possession, of, the, spanish, philippines, and, guam, on, 17, january, 1899, the, united, states, also, took, possession, of, unclaimed, and, uninhabited, wake, island, this, left, spain, with, the, remainder, of, the, spanish, east, indies, about, 6, 000, tiny, islands, that, were, sparsely, populated, and, not, very, productive, these, islands, were, ungovernable, after, the, loss, of, the, administrative, center, of, manila, and, indefensible, after, the, loss, of, two, spanish, fleets, in, the, war, the, spanish, government, therefore, decided, to, sell, the, remaining, islands, to, a, new, colonial, power, the, german, empire, the, treaty, which, was, signed, by, spanish, prime, minister, francisco, silvela, on, 12, february, 1899, transferred, the, caroline, islands, kosrae, in, the, east, to, palau, in, the, west, the, mariana, islands, and, other, possessions, to, germany, under, german, control, the, islands, became, a, protectorate, and, were, administered, from, german, new, guinea, nauru, had, already, been, annexed, and, claimed, as, a, colony, by, germany, in, 1888, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, islands, of, micronesia, were, divided, between, three, foreign, powers, during, world, war, i, germany, s, pacific, island, territories, were, seized, and, became, league, of, nations, mandates, in, 1923, nauru, became, an, australian, mandate, while, germany, s, other, territories, in, micronesia, were, given, as, a, mandate, to, japan, and, were, named, the, south, seas, mandate, during, world, war, ii, nauru, and, ocean, island, were, occupied, by, japanese, troops, with, also, an, occupation, of, some, of, the, gilbert, islands, and, were, bypassed, by, the, allied, advance, across, the, pacific, following, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, its, mandate, became, a, united, nations, trusteeship, administered, by, the, united, states, as, the, trust, territory, of, the, pacific, islands, nauru, became, independent, in, 1968, today, most, of, micronesia, are, independent, states, except, for, the, u, s, commonwealth, of, the, northern, mariana, islands, guam, and, wake, island, which, are, u, s, territories, the, pacific, community, spc, is, a, regional, intergovernmental, organisation, whose, membership, includes, both, nations, and, territories, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, their, metropolitan, powers, nationally, the, primary, income, is, the, sale, of, fishing, rights, to, foreign, nations, that, harvest, tuna, using, huge, purse, seiners, a, few, japanese, long, liners, still, ply, the, waters, the, crews, aboard, fishing, fleets, contribute, little, to, the, local, economy, since, their, ships, typically, set, sail, loaded, with, stores, and, provisions, that, are, cheaper, than, local, goods, additional, money, comes, in, from, government, grants, mostly, from, the, united, states, and, the, 150, million, the, us, paid, into, a, trust, fund, for, reparations, of, residents, of, bikini, atoll, that, had, to, move, after, nuclear, testing, few, mineral, deposits, worth, exploiting, exist, except, for, some, high, grade, phosphate, especially, on, nauru, most, residents, of, micronesia, can, freely, move, to, and, work, within, the, united, states, relatives, working, in, the, us, that, send, money, home, to, relatives, represent, the, primary, source, of, individual, income, additional, individual, income, comes, mainly, from, government, jobs, and, work, within, shops, and, restaurants, the, tourist, industry, consists, mainly, of, scuba, divers, that, come, to, see, the, coral, reefs, do, wall, dives, and, visit, sunken, ships, from, wwii, major, stops, for, scuba, divers, in, approximate, order, are, palau, chuuk, yap, and, pohnpei, some, private, yacht, owners, visit, the, area, for, months, or, years, at, a, time, however, they, tend, to, stay, mainly, at, ports, of, entry, and, are, too, few, in, number, to, be, counted, as, a, major, source, of, income, copra, production, used, to, be, a, more, significant, source, of, income, however, world, prices, have, dropped, in, part, to, large, palm, plantations, that, are, now, planted, in, places, like, borneo, the, people, today, form, many, ethnicities, but, all, are, descended, from, and, belong, to, the, micronesian, culture, because, of, this, mixture, of, descent, many, of, the, ethnicities, of, micronesia, feel, closer, to, some, groups, in, melanesia, or, the, philippines, a, good, example, of, this, are, the, yapese, people, who, are, related, to, austronesian, tribes, in, the, northern, philippines, genetics, also, show, a, significant, number, of, micronesian, have, japanese, paternal, ancestry, 9, 5, of, males, from, micronesia, as, well, as, 0, 2, in, east, timor, carry, the, haplogroup, d, m55, there, are, also, substantial, asian, communities, found, across, the, region, most, notably, in, the, northern, mariana, islands, where, they, form, the, majority, and, smaller, communities, of, europeans, who, have, migrated, from, the, united, states, or, are, descendants, of, settlers, during, european, colonial, rule, in, micronesia, though, they, are, all, geographically, part, of, the, same, region, they, all, have, very, different, colonial, histories, the, us, administered, areas, of, micronesia, have, a, unique, experience, that, sets, them, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, pacific, micronesia, has, great, economic, dependency, on, its, former, or, current, motherlands, something, only, comparable, to, the, french, pacific, sometimes, the, term, american, micronesia, is, used, to, acknowledge, the, difference, in, cultural, heritage, a, 2011, survey, found, that, 93, 1, of, micronesian, are, christians, a, survey, in, 2022, showed, that, 99, were, christian, it, is, thought, that, ancestors, of, the, carolinian, people, may, have, originally, immigrated, from, the, asian, mainland, and, indonesia, to, micronesia, around, 2, 000, years, ago, their, primary, language, is, carolinian, called, refaluwasch, by, native, speakers, which, has, a, total, of, about, 5, 700, speakers, the, carolinians, have, a, matriarchal, society, in, which, respect, is, a, very, important, factor, in, their, daily, lives, especially, toward, the, matriarchs, most, carolinians, are, of, the, roman, catholic, faith, the, immigration, of, carolinians, to, saipan, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, after, the, spanish, reduced, the, local, population, of, chamorro, natives, to, just, 3, 700, they, began, to, immigrate, mostly, sailing, from, small, canoes, from, other, islands, which, a, typhoon, previously, devastated, the, carolinians, have, a, much, darker, complexion, than, the, native, chamorros, the, chamorro, people, are, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, mariana, islands, which, are, politically, divided, between, the, united, states, territory, of, guam, and, the, united, states, commonwealth, of, the, northern, mariana, islands, in, micronesia, the, chamorro, are, commonly, believed, to, have, come, from, southeast, asia, at, around, 2000, bc, they, are, most, closely, related, to, other, austronesian, natives, to, the, west, in, the, philippines, and, taiwan, as, well, as, the, carolines, to, the, south, the, chamorro, language, is, included, in, the, malayo, polynesian, subgroup, of, the, austronesian, family, because, guam, was, colonized, by, spain, for, over, 300, years, many, words, derive, from, the, spanish, language, the, traditional, chamorro, number, system, was, replaced, by, spanish, numbers, the, chuukese, people, are, an, ethnic, group, in, oceania, they, constitute, 48, of, the, population, of, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, their, language, is, chuukese, the, home, atoll, of, chuuk, is, also, known, by, the, former, name, truk, the, nauruan, people, are, an, ethnicity, inhabiting, the, pacific, island, of, nauru, they, are, most, likely, a, blend, of, other, pacific, peoples, the, origin, of, the, nauruan, people, has, not, yet, been, finally, determined, it, can, possibly, be, explained, by, the, last, malayo, pacific, human, migration, c, 1200, it, was, probably, seafaring, or, shipwrecked, polynesians, or, melanesians, that, established, themselves, in, nauru, because, there, was, not, already, an, indigenous, people, present, whereas, the, micronesians, were, already, crossed, with, the, melanesians, in, this, area, the, roughly, 3000, residents, of, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, that, reside, in, kapingamarangi, nicknamed, kapings, live, in, one, of, the, most, remote, locations, in, both, micronesia, and, the, world, at, large, their, home, atoll, is, almost, 320, km, 200, mi, from, the, nearest, point, of, immigration, there, are, no, regular, flights, the, only, reliable, way, to, legally, visit, is, to, travel, on, a, high, speed, sailboat, to, the, atoll, owing, to, this, difficulty, few, sailors, travelling, the, pacific, attempt, to, visit, the, local, language, is, the, kapingamarangi, language, from, the, 1970s, to, attend, high, school, the, children, needed, to, travel, to, pohnpei, bringing, their, parents, with, them, to, create, communities, of, kapings, on, the, island, there, are, large, east, south, and, southeast, asian, communities, found, across, certain, micronesian, countries, that, are, either, immigrants, foreign, workers, or, descendants, of, either, one, most, migrated, to, the, islands, during, the, 1800s, and, 1900s, according, to, the, 2010, census, results, guam, was, 26, 3, filipino, 2, 2, korean, 1, 6, chinese, and, 2, other, asian, the, 2010, census, showed, the, northern, mariana, islands, was, 50, asian, of, which, 35, 3, were, filipino, 6,
