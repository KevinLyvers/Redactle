urban, design, is, an, approach, to, the, design, of, buildings, and, the, spaces, between, them, that, focuses, on, specific, design, processes, and, outcomes, in, addition, to, designing, and, shaping, the, physical, features, of, towns, cities, and, regional, spaces, urban, design, considers, bigger, picture, issues, of, economic, social, and, environmental, value, and, social, design, the, scope, of, a, project, can, range, from, a, local, street, or, public, space, to, an, entire, city, and, surrounding, areas, urban, designers, connect, the, fields, of, architecture, landscape, architecture, and, urban, planning, to, better, organize, physical, space, and, community, environments, some, important, focuses, of, urban, design, on, this, page, include, its, historical, impact, paradigm, shifts, its, interdisciplinary, nature, and, issues, related, to, urban, design, urban, design, deals, with, the, larger, scale, of, groups, of, buildings, infrastructure, streets, and, public, spaces, entire, neighbourhoods, and, districts, and, entire, cities, with, the, goal, of, making, urban, environments, that, are, equitable, beautiful, performative, and, sustainable, urban, design, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, utilizes, the, procedures, and, the, elements, of, architecture, and, other, related, professions, including, landscape, design, urban, planning, civil, engineering, and, municipal, engineering, it, borrows, substantive, and, procedural, knowledge, from, public, administration, sociology, law, urban, geography, urban, economics, and, other, related, disciplines, from, the, social, and, behavioral, sciences, as, well, as, from, the, natural, sciences, in, more, recent, times, different, sub, subfields, of, urban, design, have, emerged, such, as, strategic, urban, design, landscape, urbanism, water, sensitive, urban, design, and, sustainable, urbanism, urban, design, demands, an, understanding, of, a, wide, range, of, subjects, from, physical, geography, to, social, science, and, an, appreciation, for, disciplines, such, as, real, estate, development, urban, economics, political, economy, and, social, theory, urban, design, theory, deals, primarily, with, the, design, and, management, of, public, space, i, e, the, public, environment, public, realm, or, public, domain, and, the, way, public, places, are, used, and, experienced, public, space, includes, the, totality, of, spaces, used, freely, on, a, day, to, day, basis, by, the, general, public, such, as, streets, plazas, parks, and, public, infrastructure, some, aspects, of, privately, owned, spaces, such, as, building, facades, or, domestic, gardens, also, contribute, to, public, space, and, are, therefore, also, considered, by, urban, design, theory, important, writers, on, urban, design, theory, include, christopher, alexander, peter, calthorpe, gordon, cullen, andr, s, duany, jane, jacobs, jan, gehl, allan, b, jacobs, kevin, lynch, aldo, rossi, colin, rowe, robert, venturi, william, h, whyte, camillo, sitte, bill, hillier, space, syntax, and, elizabeth, plater, zyberk, although, contemporary, professional, use, of, the, term, urban, design, dates, from, the, mid, 20th, century, urban, design, as, such, has, been, practiced, throughout, history, ancient, examples, of, carefully, planned, and, designed, cities, exist, in, asia, africa, europe, and, the, americas, and, are, particularly, well, known, within, classical, chinese, roman, and, greek, cultures, specifically, hippodamus, of, miletus, was, a, famous, ancient, greek, architect, and, urban, planner, and, all, around, academic, that, is, often, considered, to, be, a, father, of, european, urban, planning, and, the, namesake, of, the, hippodamian, plan, also, known, as, the, grid, plan, of, a, city, layout, european, medieval, cities, are, often, and, often, erroneously, regarded, as, exemplars, of, undesigned, or, organic, city, development, there, are, many, examples, of, considered, urban, design, in, the, middle, ages, in, england, many, of, the, towns, listed, in, the, 9th, century, burghal, hidage, were, designed, on, a, grid, examples, including, southampton, wareham, dorset, and, wallingford, oxfordshire, having, been, rapidly, created, to, provide, a, defensive, network, against, danish, invaders, 12th, century, western, europe, brought, renewed, focus, on, urbanisation, as, a, means, of, stimulating, economic, growth, and, generating, revenue, the, burgage, system, dating, from, that, time, and, its, associated, burgage, plots, brought, a, form, of, self, organising, design, to, medieval, towns, throughout, history, the, design, of, streets, and, deliberate, configuration, of, public, spaces, with, buildings, have, reflected, contemporaneous, social, norms, or, philosophical, and, religious, beliefs, yet, the, link, between, designed, urban, space, and, the, human, mind, appears, to, be, bidirectional, indeed, the, reverse, impact, of, urban, structure, upon, human, behaviour, and, upon, thought, is, evidenced, by, both, observational, study, and, historical, records, there, are, clear, indications, of, impact, through, renaissance, urban, design, on, the, thought, of, johannes, kepler, and, galileo, galilei, already, ren, descartes, in, his, discourse, on, the, method, had, attested, to, the, impact, renaissance, planned, new, towns, had, upon, his, own, thought, and, much, evidence, exists, that, the, renaissance, streetscape, was, also, the, perceptual, stimulus, that, had, led, to, the, development, of, coordinate, geometry, the, beginnings, of, modern, urban, design, in, europe, are, associated, with, the, renaissance, but, especially, with, the, age, of, enlightenment, spanish, colonial, cities, were, often, planned, as, were, some, towns, settled, by, other, imperial, cultures, these, sometimes, embodied, utopian, ambitions, as, well, as, aims, for, functionality, and, good, governance, as, with, james, oglethorpe, s, plan, for, savannah, georgia, in, the, baroque, period, the, design, approaches, developed, in, french, formal, gardens, such, as, versailles, were, extended, into, urban, development, and, redevelopment, in, this, period, when, modern, professional, specializations, did, not, exist, urban, design, was, undertaken, by, people, with, skills, in, areas, as, diverse, as, sculpture, architecture, garden, design, surveying, astronomy, and, military, engineering, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, urban, design, was, perhaps, most, closely, linked, with, surveyors, engineers, and, architects, the, increase, in, urban, populations, brought, with, it, problems, of, epidemic, disease, the, response, to, which, was, a, focus, on, public, health, the, rise, in, the, uk, of, municipal, engineering, and, the, inclusion, in, british, legislation, of, provisions, such, as, minimum, widths, of, street, in, relation, to, heights, of, buildings, in, order, to, ensure, adequate, light, and, ventilation, much, of, frederick, law, olmsted, s, work, was, concerned, with, urban, design, and, the, newly, formed, profession, of, landscape, architecture, also, began, to, play, a, significant, role, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, 19th, century, cities, were, industrializing, and, expanding, at, a, tremendous, rate, private, businesses, largely, dictated, the, pace, and, style, of, this, development, the, expansion, created, many, hardships, for, the, working, poor, and, concern, for, public, health, increased, however, the, laissez, faire, style, of, government, in, fashion, for, most, of, the, victorian, era, was, starting, to, give, way, to, a, new, liberalism, this, gave, more, power, to, the, public, the, public, wanted, the, government, to, provide, citizens, especially, factory, workers, with, healthier, environments, around, 1900, modern, urban, design, emerged, from, developing, theories, on, how, to, mitigate, the, consequences, of, the, industrial, age, the, first, modern, urban, planning, theorist, was, sir, ebenezer, howard, his, ideas, although, utopian, were, adopted, around, the, world, because, they, were, highly, practical, he, initiated, the, garden, city, movement, in, 1898, his, garden, cities, were, intended, to, be, planned, self, contained, communities, surrounded, by, parks, howard, wanted, the, cities, to, be, proportional, with, separate, areas, of, residences, industry, and, agriculture, inspired, by, the, utopian, novel, looking, backward, and, henry, george, s, work, progress, and, poverty, howard, published, his, book, garden, cities, of, to, morrow, in, 1898, his, work, is, an, important, reference, in, the, history, of, urban, planning, he, envisioned, the, self, sufficient, garden, city, to, house, 32, 000, people, on, a, site, of, 6, 000, acres, 2, 428, ha, he, planned, on, a, concentric, pattern, with, open, spaces, public, parks, and, six, radial, boulevards, 120, ft, 37, m, wide, extending, from, the, center, when, it, reached, full, population, howard, wanted, another, garden, city, to, be, developed, nearby, he, envisaged, a, cluster, of, several, garden, cities, as, satellites, of, a, central, city, of, 50, 000, people, linked, by, road, and, rail, his, model, for, a, garden, city, was, first, created, at, letchworth, and, welwyn, garden, city, in, hertfordshire, howard, s, movement, was, extended, by, sir, frederic, osborn, to, regional, planning, in, the, early, 1900s, urban, planning, became, professionalized, with, input, from, utopian, visionaries, civil, engineers, and, local, councilors, new, approaches, to, city, design, were, developed, for, consideration, by, decision, makers, such, as, elected, officials, in, 1899, the, town, and, country, planning, association, was, founded, in, 1909, the, first, academic, course, on, urban, planning, was, offered, by, the, university, of, liverpool, urban, planning, was, first, officially, embodied, in, the, housing, and, town, planning, act, of, 1909, howard, s, garden, city, compelled, local, authorities, to, introduce, a, system, where, all, housing, construction, conformed, to, specific, building, standards, in, the, united, kingdom, following, this, act, surveyor, civil, engineers, architects, and, lawyers, began, working, together, within, local, authorities, in, 1910, thomas, adams, became, the, first, town, planning, inspector, at, the, local, government, board, and, began, meeting, with, practitioners, in, 1914, the, town, planning, institute, was, established, the, first, urban, planning, course, in, america, was, not, established, until, 1924, at, harvard, university, professionals, developed, schemes, for, the, development, of, land, transforming, town, planning, into, a, new, area, of, expertise, in, the, 20th, century, urban, planning, was, changed, by, the, automobile, industry, car, oriented, design, impacted, the, rise, of, urban, design, city, layouts, now, revolved, around, roadways, and, traffic, patterns, in, june, 1928, the, international, congresses, of, modern, architecture, ciam, was, founded, at, the, chateau, de, la, sarraz, in, switzerland, by, a, group, of, 28, european, architects, organized, by, le, corbusier, h, l, ne, de, mandrot, and, sigfried, giedion, the, ciam, was, one, of, many, 20th, century, manifestos, meant, to, advance, the, cause, of, architecture, as, a, social, art, team, x, was, a, group, of, architects, and, other, invited, participants, who, assembled, starting, in, july, 1953, at, the, 9th, congress, of, the, international, congresses, of, modern, architecture, ciam, and, created, a, schism, within, ciam, by, challenging, its, doctrinaire, approach, to, urbanism, in, 1956, the, term, urban, design, was, first, used, at, a, series, of, conferences, hosted, by, harvard, university, the, event, provided, a, platform, for, harvard, s, urban, design, program, the, program, also, utilized, the, writings, of, famous, urban, planning, thinkers, gordon, cullen, jane, jacobs, kevin, lynch, and, christopher, alexander, in, 1961, gordon, cullen, published, the, concise, townscape, he, examined, the, traditional, artistic, approach, to, city, design, of, theorists, including, camillo, sitte, barry, parker, and, raymond, unwin, cullen, also, created, the, concept, of, serial, vision, it, defined, the, urban, landscape, as, a, series, of, related, spaces, also, in, 1961, jane, jacobs, published, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, she, critiqued, the, modernism, of, ciam, international, congresses, of, modern, architecture, jacobs, also, claimed, crime, rates, in, publicly, owned, spaces, were, rising, because, of, the, modernist, approach, of, city, in, the, park, she, argued, instead, for, an, eyes, on, the, street, approach, to, town, planning, through, the, resurrection, of, main, public, space, precedents, e, g, streets, squares, in, the, same, year, kevin, lynch, published, the, image, of, the, city, he, was, seminal, to, urban, design, particularly, with, regards, to, the, concept, of, legibility, he, reduced, urban, design, theory, to, five, basic, elements, paths, districts, edges, nodes, landmarks, he, also, made, the, use, of, mental, maps, to, understand, the, city, popular, rather, than, the, two, dimensional, physical, master, plans, of, the, previous, 50, years, other, notable, works, the, popularity, of, these, works, resulted, in, terms, that, become, everyday, language, in, the, field, of, urban, planning, aldo, rossi, introduced, historicism, and, collective, memory, to, urban, design, rossi, also, proposed, a, collage, metaphor, to, understand, the, collection, of, new, and, old, forms, within, the, same, urban, space, peter, calthorpe, developed, a, manifesto, for, sustainable, urban, living, via, medium, density, living, he, also, designed, a, manual, for, building, new, settlements, in, his, concept, of, transit, oriented, development, tod, bill, hillier, and, julienne, hanson, introduced, space, syntax, to, predict, how, movement, patterns, in, cities, would, contribute, to, urban, vitality, anti, social, behaviour, and, economic, success, sustainability, livability, and, high, quality, of, urban, components, also, became, commonplace, in, the, field, today, urban, design, seeks, to, create, sustainable, urban, environments, with, long, lasting, structures, buildings, and, overall, livability, walkable, urbanism, is, another, approach, to, practice, that, is, defined, within, the, charter, of, new, urbanism, it, aims, to, reduce, environmental, impacts, by, altering, the, built, environment, to, create, smart, cities, that, support, sustainable, transport, compact, urban, neighborhoods, encourage, residents, to, drive, less, these, neighborhoods, have, significantly, lower, environmental, impacts, when, compared, to, sprawling, suburbs, to, prevent, urban, sprawl, circular, flow, land, use, management, was, introduced, in, europe, to, promote, sustainable, land, use, patterns, as, a, result, of, the, recent, new, classical, architecture, movement, sustainable, construction, aims, to, develop, smart, growth, walkability, architectural, tradition, and, classical, design, it, contrasts, with, modernist, and, globally, uniform, architecture, in, the, 1980s, urban, design, began, to, oppose, the, increasing, solitary, housing, estates, and, suburban, sprawl, managed, urbanisation, with, the, view, to, making, the, urbanising, process, completely, culturally, and, economically, and, environmentally, sustainable, and, as, a, possible, solution, to, the, urban, sprawl, frank, reale, has, submitted, an, interesting, concept, of, expanding, nodular, development, e, n, d, that, integrates, many, urban, designs, and, ecological, principles, to, design, and, build, smaller, rural, hubs, with, high, grade, connecting, freeways, rather, than, adding, more, expensive, infrastructure, to, existing, big, cities, and, the, resulting, congestion, throughout, the, young, existence, of, the, urban, design, discipline, many, paradigm, shifts, have, occurred, that, have, affected, the, trajectory, of, the, field, regarding, theory, and, practice, these, paradigm, shifts, cover, multiple, subject, areas, outside, of, the, traditional, design, disciplines, there, have, been, many, different, theories, and, approaches, applied, to, the, practice, of, urban, design, new, urbanism, is, an, approach, that, began, in, the, 1980s, as, a, place, making, initiative, to, combat, suburban, sprawl, its, goal, is, to, increase, density, by, creating, compact, and, complete, towns, and, neighborhoods, the, 10, principles, of, new, urbanism, are, walkability, connectivity, mixed, use, and, diversity, mixed, housing, quality, architecture, and, urban, design, traditional, neighborhood, structure, increased, density, smart, transportation, sustainability, and, quality, of, life, new, urbanism, and, the, developments, that, it, has, created, are, sources, of, debates, within, the, discipline, primarily, with, the, landscape, urbanist, approach, but, also, due, to, its, reproduction, of, idyllic, architectural, tropes, that, do, not, respond, to, the, context, andres, duany, elizabeth, plater, zyberk, peter, calthorpe, and, jeff, speck, are, all, strongly, associated, with, new, urbanism, and, its, evolution, over, the, years, landscape, urbanism, is, a, theory, that, first, surfaced, in, the, 1990s, arguing, that, the, city, is, constructed, of, interconnected, and, ecologically, rich, horizontal, field, conditions, rather, than, the, arrangement, of, objects, and, buildings, charles, waldheim, mohsen, mostafavi, james, corner, and, richard, weller, are, closely, associated, with, this, theory, landscape, urbanism, theorises, sites, territories, ecosystems, networks, and, infrastructures, through, landscape, practice, according, to, corner, while, applying, a, dynamic, concept, to, cities, as, ecosystems, that, grow, shrink, or, change, phases, of, development, according, to, waldheim, everyday, urbanism, is, a, concept, introduced, by, margaret, crawford, and, influenced, by, henry, lefebvre, that, describes, the, everyday, lived, experience, shared, by, urban, residents, including, commuting, working, relaxing, moving, through, city, streets, and, sidewalks, shopping, buying, eating, food, and, running, errands, everyday, urbanism, is, not, concerned, with, aesthetic, value, instead, it, introduces, the, idea, of, eliminating, the, distance, between, experts, and, ordinary, users, and, forces, designers, and, planners, to, contemplate, a, shift, of, power, and, address, social, life, from, a, direct, and, ordinary, perspective, tactical, urbanism, also, known, as, diy, urbanism, planning, by, doing, urban, acupuncture, or, urban, prototyping, is, a, city, organizational, or, citizen, led, approach, to, neighborhood, building, that, uses, short, term, low, cost, and, scalable, interventions, and, policies, to, catalyze, long, term, change, top, up, urbanism, is, the, theory, and, implementation, of, two, techniques, in, urban, design, top, down, and, bottom, up, top, down, urbanism, is, when, the, design, is, implemented, from, the, top, of, the, hierarchy, normally, the, government, or, planning, department, bottom, up, or, grassroots, urbanism, begins, with, the, people, or, the, bottom, of, the, hierarchy, top, up, means, that, both, methods, are, used, together, to, make, a, more, participatory, design, so, it, is, sure, to, be, comprehensive, and, well, regarded, in, order, to, be, as, successful, as, possible, infrastructural, urbanism, is, the, study, of, how, the, major, investments, that, go, into, making, infrastructural, systems, can, be, leveraged, to, be, more, sustainable, for, communities, instead, of, the, systems, being, solely, about, efficiency, in, both, cost, and, production, infrastructural, urbanism, strives, to, utilize, these, investments, to, be, more, equitable, for, social, and, environmental, issues, as, well, linda, samuels, is, a, designer, investigating, how, to, accomplish, this, change, in, infrastructure, in, what, she, calls, next, generation, infrastructure, which, is, multifunctional, public, visible, socially, productive, locally, specific, flexible, and, adaptable, sensitive, to, the, eco, economy, composed, of, design, prototypes, or, demonstration, projects, symbiotic, technologically, smart, and, developed, collaboratively, across, disciplines, and, agencies, sustainable, urbanism, is, the, study, from, the, 1990s, of, how, a, community, can, be, beneficial, for, the, ecosystem, the, people, and, the, economy, for, which, it, is, associated, it, is, based, on, scott, campbell, s, planner, s, triangle, which, tries, to, find, the, balance, between, economy, equity, and, the, environment, its, main, concept, is, to, try, and, make, cities, as, self, sufficient, as, possible, while, not, damaging, the, ecosystem, around, them, today, with, an, increased, focus, on, climate, stability, a, key, designer, working, with, sustainable, urbanism, is, douglas, farr, feminist, urbanism, is, the, study, and, critique, of, how, the, built, environment, affects, genders, differently, because, of, patriarchal, social, and, political, structures, in, society, typically, the, people, at, the, table, making, design, decisions, are, men, so, their, conception, about, public, space, and, the, built, environment, relates, to, their, life, perspectives, and, experiences, which, do, not, reflect, the, same, experiences, of, women, or, children, dolores, hayden, is, a, scholar, who, has, researched, this, topic, from, 1980, to, the, present, day, hayden, s, writing, says, when, women, men, and, children, of, all, classes, and, races, can, identify, the, public, domain, as, the, place, where, they, feel, most, comfortable, as, citizens, americans, will, finally, have, homelike, urban, space, educational, urbanism, is, an, emerging, discipline, at, the, crossroads, of, urban, planning, educational, planning, and, pedagogy, an, approach, that, tackles, the, notion, that, economic, activities, the, need, for, new, skills, at, the, workplace, and, the, spatial, configuration, of, the, workplace, rely, on, the, spatial, reorientation, in, the, design, of, educational, spaces, and, the, urban, dimension, of, educational, planning, black, urbanism, is, an, approach, in, which, black, communities, are, active, creators, innovators, and, authors, of, the, process, of, designing, and, creating, the, neighborhoods, and, spaces, of, the, metropolitan, areas, they, have, done, so, much, to, help, revive, over, the, past, half, century, the, goal, is, not, to, build, black, cities, for, black, people, but, to, explore, and, develop, the, creative, energy, that, exists, in, so, called, black, areas, that, has, the, potential, to, contribute, to, the, sustainable, development, of, the, whole, city, underlying, the, practice, of, urban, design, are, the, many, theories, about, how, to, best, design, the, city, each, theory, makes, a, unique, claim, about, how, to, effectively, design, thriving, sustainable, urban, environments, debates, over, the, efficacy, of, these, approaches, fill, the, urban, design, discourse, landscape, urbanism, and, new, urbanism, are, commonly, debated, as, distinct, approaches, to, addressing, suburban, sprawl, while, landscape, urbanism, proposes, landscape, as, the, basic, building, block, of, the, city, and, embraces, horizontality, flexibility, and, adaptability, new, urbanism, offers, the, neighborhood, as, the, basic, building, block, of, the, city, and, argues, for, increased, density, mixed, uses, and, walkability, opponents, of, landscape, urbanism, point, out, that, most, of, its, projects, are, urban, parks, and, as, such, its, application, is, limited, opponents, of, new, urbanism, claim, that, its, preoccupation, with, traditional, neighborhood, structures, is, nostalgic, unimaginative, and, culturally, problematic, everyday, urbanism, argues, for, grassroots, neighborhood, improvements, rather, than, master, planned, top, down, interventions, each, theory, elevates, the, roles, of, certain, professions, in, the, urban, design, process, further, fueling, the, debate, in, practice, urban, designers, often, apply, principles, from, many, urban, design, theories, emerging, from, the, conversation, is, a, universal, acknowledgement, of, the, importance, of, increased, interdisciplinary, collaboration, in, designing, the, modern, city, urban, designers, work, with, architects, landscape, architects, transportation, engineers, urban, planners, and, industrial, designers, to, reshape, the, city, cooperation, with, public, agencies, authorities, and, the, interests, of, nearby, property, owners, is, necessary, to, manage, public, spaces, users, often, compete, over, the, spaces, and, negotiate, across, a, variety, of, spheres, input, is, frequently, needed, from, a, wide, range, of, stakeholders, this, can, lead, to, different, levels, of, participation, as, defined, in, arnstein, s, ladder, of, citizen, participation, while, there, are, some, professionals, who, identify, themselves, specifically, as, urban, designers, a, majority, have, backgrounds, in, urban, planning, architecture, or, landscape, architecture, many, collegiate, programs, incorporate, urban, design, theory, and, design, subjects, into, their, curricula, there, is, an, increasing, number, of, university, programs, offering, degrees, in, urban, design, at, the, post, graduate, level, urban, design, considers, the, original, urban, design, was, thought, to, be, separated, from, architecture, and, urban, planning, urban, design, has, developed, to, a, certain, extent, and, comes, from, the, foundation, of, engineering, in, anglo, saxon, countries, it, is, often, considered, as, a, branch, under, the, architecture, urban, planning, and, landscape, architecture, and, limited, as, the, construction, of, the, urban, physical, environment, however, urban, design, is, more, integrated, into, the, social, science, based, cultural, economic, political, and, other, aspects, not, only, focus, on, space, and, architectural, group, but, also, look, at, the, whole, city, from, a, broader, and, more, holistic, perspective, to, shape, a, better, living, environment, compared, to, architecture, the, spatial, and, temporal, scale, of, urban, design, processing, is, much, larger, it, deals, with, neighborhoods, communities, and, even, the, entire, city, the, university, of, liverpool, s, department, of, civic, design, is, the, first, urban, design, school, in, the, world, founded, in, 1909, following, the, 1956, urban, design, conference, harvard, university, established, the, first, graduate, program, with, urban, design, in, its, title, the, master, of, architecture, in, urban, design, although, as, a, subject, taught, in, universities, its, history, in, europe, is, far, older, urban, design, programs, explore, the, built, environment, from, diverse, disciplinary, backgrounds, and, points, of, view, the, pedagogically, innovative, combination, of, interdisciplinary, studios, lecture, courses, seminars, and, independent, study, creates, an, intimate, and, engaging, educational, atmosphere, in, which, students, thrive, and, learn, soon, after, in, 1961, washington, university, in, st, louis, founded, their, master, of, urban, design, program, today, twenty, urban, design, programs, exist, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, kingdom, master, s, programmes, in, urban, design, at, university, of, manchester, or, university, of, sheffield, and, cardiff, university, or, london, south, bank, university, and, city, design, at, the, royal, college, of, art, or, queen, s, university, belfast, are, offered, the, field, of, urban, design, holds, enormous, potential, for, helping, us, address, today, s, biggest, challenges, an, expanding, population, mass, urbanization, rising, inequality, and, climate, change, in, its, practice, as, well, as, its, theories, urban, design, attempts, to, tackle, these, pressing, issues, as, climate, change, progresses, urban, design, can, mitigate, the, results, of, flooding, temperature, changes, and, increasingly, detrimental, storm, impacts, through, a, mindset, of, sustainability, and, resilience, in, doing, so, the, urban, design, discipline, attempts, to, create, environments, that, are, constructed, with, longevity, in, mind, such, as, zero, carbon, cities, cities, today, must, be, designed, to, minimize, resource, consumption, waste, generation, and, pollution, while, also, withstanding, the, unprecedented, impacts, of, climate, change, to, be, truly, resilient, our, cities, need, to, be, able, to, not, just, bounce, back, from, a, catastrophic, climate, event, but, to, bounce, forward, to, an, improved, state, another, issue, in, this, field, is, that, it, is, often, assumed, that, there, are, no, mothers, of, planning, and, urban, design, however, this, is, not, the, case, many, women, have, made, proactive, contributions, to, the, field, including, the, work, of, mary, kingsbury, simkhovitch, florence, kelley, and, lillian, wald, to, name, a, few, of, whom, were, prominent, leaders, in, the, city, social, movement, the, city, social, was, a, movement, that, steamed, between, the, commonly, known, city, practical, and, city, beautiful, movements, it, was, a, movement, mainly, concerning, lay, with, the, economic, and, social, equalities, regarding, urban, issues, justice, is, and, will, always, be, a, key, issue, in, urban, design, as, previously, mentioned, past, urban, strategies, have, caused, injustices, within, communities, incapable, of, being, remedied, via, simple, means, as, urban, designers, tackle, the, issue, of, justice, they, often, are, required, to, look, at, the, injustices, of, the, past, and, must, be, careful, not, to, overlook, the, nuances, of, race, place, and, socioeconomic, status, in, their, design, efforts, this, includes, ensuring, reasonable, access, to, basic, services, transportation, and, fighting, against, gentrification, and, the, commodification, of, space, for, economic, gain, organizations, such, as, the, divided, cities, initiatives, at, washington, university, in, st, louis, and, the, just, city, lab, at, harvard, work, on, promoting, justice, in, urban, design, until, the, 1970s, the, design, of, towns, and, cities, took, little, account, of, the, needs, of, people, with, disabilities, at, that, time, disabled, people, began, to, form, movements, demanding, recognition, of, their, potential, contribution, if, social, obstacles, were, removed, disabled, people, challenged, the, medical, model, of, disability, which, saw, physical, and, mental, problems, as, an, individual, tragedy, and, people, with, disabilities, as, brave, for, enduring, them, they, proposed, instead, a, social, model, which, said, that, barriers, to, disabled, people, result, from, the, design, of, the, built, environment, and, attitudes, of, able, bodied, people, access, groups, were, established, composed, of, people, with, disabilities, who, audited, their, local, areas, checked, planning, applications, and, made, representations, for, improvements, the, new, profession, of, access, officer, was, established, around, that, time, to, produce, guidelines, based, on, the, recommendations, of, access, groups, and, to, oversee, adaptations, to, existing, buildings, as, well, as, to, check, on, the, accessibility, of, new, proposals, many, local, authorities, now, employ, access, officers, who, are, regulated, by, the, access, association, a, new, chapter, of, the, building, regulations, part, m, was, introduced, in, 1992, although, it, was, beneficial, to, have, legislation, on, this, issue, the, requirements, were, fairly, minimal, but, continue, to, be, improved, with, ongoing, amendments, the, disability, discrimination, act, 1995, continues, to, raise, awareness, and, enforce, action, on, disability, issues, in, the, urban, environment, the, issue, of, walkability, has, gained, prominence, in, recent, years, not, only, with, the, concerns, of, the, aforementioned, climate, change, but, also, the, health, outcomes, of, residents, car, centric, urban, design, has, an, invariably, negative, effect, on, such, outcomes, with, proximity, to, internal, combustion, engines, residents, tend, to, suffer, from, dangerous, levels, of, air, pollution, which, lead, to, cardiovascular, complications, ranging, from, the, acute, in, hypertension, and, alterations, in, heart, rate, and, the, chronic, the, outright, development, of, atherosclerosis, more, people, die, from, air, pollution, each, year, than, from, car, accidents, this, issue, has, been, used, to, fuel, movements, for, alternative, forms, of, long, to, mid, range, transportation, such, as, trains, and, bicycles, with, walking, as, the, primary, means, of, short, range, travel, this, would, bring, benefits, from, two, simultaneous, avenues, the, physical, activity, from, walking, and, the, lack, of, particulate, matter, carbon, dioxide, sulfur, dioxide, nitrogen, dioxide, etc, has, shown, to, alleviate, and, lower, the, risk, of, many, maladies, such, as, diabetes, hypertension, and, cardiovascular, disease, physical, activity, levels, from, walking, are, closely, related, to, the, abundance, of, open, public, spaces, commercial, shops, greenery, among, others, these, attributes, also, have, been, stated, to, contribute, to, stronger, social, and, emotional, health, as, the, open, public, spaces, facilitate, more, social, interaction, within, communities, this, issue, is, most, prevalent, in, the, united, states, where, the, rise, of, neoliberalism, directly, and, intentionally, caused, the, car, centric, infrastructure
