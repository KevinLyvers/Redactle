native, tribes, but, his, successor, mirabeau, b, lamar, took, a, much, more, hostile, stance, hostility, towards, natives, by, white, texans, prompted, the, movement, of, most, native, populations, north, into, what, would, become, indian, territory, modern, oklahoma, only, the, alabama, coushatta, would, remain, in, the, parts, of, texas, subject, to, white, settlement, though, the, comanche,

expedition, european, powers, ignored, the, area, until, accidentally, settling, there, in, 1685, miscalculations, by, ren, robert, cavelier, de, la, salle, resulted, in, his, establishing, the, colony, of, fort, saint, louis, at, matagorda, bay, rather, than, along, the, mississippi, river, the, colony, lasted, only, four, years, before, succumbing, to, harsh, conditions, and, hostile,

first, applied, for, annexation, to, the, united, states, in, 1836, but, its, status, as, a, slaveholding, country, caused, its, admission, to, be, controversial, and, it, was, initially, rebuffed,

permanent, c, s, constitution, on, march, 23, not, all, texans, favored, secession, initially, although, many, of, the, same, would, later, support, the, southern, cause, texas, s, most, notable, unionist, was, the, state, governor, sam, houston, not, wanting, to, aggravate, the, situation, houston, refused, two, offers, from, president, lincoln, for, union, troops, to, keep, him, in, office, after, refusing, to, swear, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, confederacy, houston, was, deposed, while, far, from, the, major, battlefields, of, the, american, civil, war, texas, contributed, large, numbers, of, soldiers, and, equipment, union, troops, briefly, occupied, the, state, s, primary, port, galveston, texas, s, border, with, mexico, was, known, as, the, backdoor, of, the, confederacy, because, trade, occurred, at, the, border, bypassing, the, union, blockade, the, confederacy, repulsed, all, union, attempts, to, shut, down, this, route, but, texas, s, role, as, a, supply, state, was, marginalized, in, mid, 1863, after, the, union, capture, of, the, mississippi, river, the, final, battle, of, the, civil, war, was, fought, at, palmito, ranch, near, brownsville, texas, and, saw, a, confederate, victory, texas, descended, into, anarchy, for, two, months, between, the, surrender, of, the, army, of, northern, virginia, and, the, assumption, of, authority, by, union, general,

reconstruction, requirements, congress, resumed, allowing, elected, texas, representatives, into, the, federal, government, in, 1870, social, volatility, continued, as, the, state, struggled, with, agricultural, depression, and, labor, issues, like, most, of, the, south, the, texas, economy, was, devastated, by, the, war, however, since, the, state, had, not, been, as, dependent, on, slaves, as, other, parts, of, the, south, it, was, able, to, recover, more, quickly, the, culture, in, texas, during, the, later, 19th, century, exhibited, many, facets, of, a, frontier, territory, the, state, became, notorious, as, a, haven, for, people, from, other, parts, of, the, country, who, wanted, to, escape, debt, war, tensions, or, other, problems, gone, to, texas, was, a, common, expression, for, those, fleeing, the, law, in, other, states, nevertheless, the, state, also, attracted, many, businessmen, and, other, settlers, with, more, legitimate, interests, the, cattle, industry, continued, to, thrive, though, it, gradually, became, less, profitable, cotton, and, lumber, became, major, industries, creating, new, economic, booms, in, various, regions, railroad, networks, grew, rapidly, as, did, the, port, at, galveston, as, commerce, expanded, the, lumber, industry, quickly, expanded, and, was, texas, largest, industry, prior, to, the, 20th, century, in, 1900, texas, suffered, the,
