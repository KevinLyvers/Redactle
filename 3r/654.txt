subdivided, into, 853, municipalities, the, largest, number, among, brazilian, states, the, state, s, terrain, is, quite, rugged, and, some, of, brazil, s, highest, peaks, are, located, in, its, territory, it, is, also, home, to, the, source, of, some, of, brazil, s, main, rivers, such, as, the, s, o, francisco, and, grande, rivers, which, places, it, in, a, strategic, position, with, regard, to, the, country, s, water, resources, it, has, a, tropical, climate, which, varies, from, colder, and, humid, in, the, south, to, semi, arid, in, its, northern, portion, all, of, these, combined, factors, provide, it, with, a, rich, fauna, and, flora, distributed, in, the, biomes, that, cover, the, state, especially, the, cerrado, and, the, threatened, atlantic, forest, minas, gerais, territory, was, inhabited, by, indigenous, peoples, when, the, portuguese, arrived, in, brazil, it, experienced, a, large, migration, wave, following, the, discovery, of, gold, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, mining, of, gold, brought, wealth, and, development, to, the, then, captaincy, providing, its, economic, and, cultural, development, however, gold, soon, became, scarce, causing, the, emigration, of, a, large, part, of, the, population, until, a, new, cycle, that, of, coffee, once, again, brought, minas, gerais, national, prominence, and, whose, end, led, to, the, relatively, late, industrialization, process, minas, gerais, currently, has, the, third, largest, gdp, among, brazilian, states, with, a, large, part, of, it, still, being, the, product, of, mining, activities, the, state, also, has, a, notable, infrastructure, with, a, large, number, of, hydroelectric, plants, and, the, largest, road, network, in, the, country, due, to, its, natural, beauty, and, historical, heritage, minas, gerais, is, an, important, tourist, destination, it, is, known, for, its, heritage, of, colonial, architecture, and, art, in, historical, cities, such, as, ouro, preto, and, diamantina, s, o, jo, o, del, rei, mariana, tiradentes, congonhas, sabar, and, serro, in, the, south, its, tourist, points, are, hydro, mineral, spas, such, as, the, municipalities, of, caxambu, lambari, s, o, louren, o, po, os, de, caldas, s, o, thom, das, letras, monte, verde, a, district, of, camanducaia, and, the, national, parks, of, capara, and, canastra, in, the, serra, do, cip, sete,

manifestations, and, typical, countryside, cuisine, in, addition, to, national, importance, in, contemporary, artistic, productions, and, also, in, the, sports, scene, two, interpretations, are, given, for, the, origin, of, the, name, minas, gerais, the, first, interpretation, is, that, the, name, simply, means, general, mines, referring, to, a, number, of, mines, which, were, located, in, several, spots, spread, around, a, larger, region, the, second, interpretation, derives, the, name, from, the, former, name, of, the, colonial, province, minas, dos, matos, gerais, mines, of, the, general, woods, referring, to, two, distinct, regions, encompassed, by, the, state, the, region, of, the, mines, minas, and, the, general, region, matos, gerais, or, campos, gerais, roughly, meaning, general, fields, the, latter, corresponded, to, the, areas, of, sert, o, which, were, farther, and, hard, to, access, with, an, economy, based, on, farming, and, agriculture, from, the, mining, spots, whose, economic, space, was, urban, in, origin, part, of, the, history, of, the, current, state, of, minas, gerais, was, determined, by, the, exploration, of, the, great, mineral, wealth, found, in, its, territory, its, name, in, fact, comes, from, the, large, quantity, and, variety, of, mines, present, which, began, to, be, explored, since, the, 17th, century, and, to, this, day, drive, an, important, fraction, of, the, state, s, economy, in, the, mid, 19th, century, danish, paleontologist, peter, wilhelm, lund, discovered, in, the, lagoa, santa, region, human, remains, belonging, to, a, population, that, lived, there, thousands, of, years, ago, nicknamed, the, lagoa, santa, people, the, region, of, minas, gerais, was, inhabited, by, indigenous, peoples, as, long, as, 11, 400, to, 12, 000, years, ago, based, on, the, estimated, age, of, the, luzia, woman, the, name, of, the, oldest, human, fossil, found, in, the, americas, luzia, was, found, in, 1974, in, excavations, in, lapa, vermelha, a, cave, between, the, municipalities, of, lagoa, santa, and, pedro, leopoldo, in, the, metropolitan, region, of, belo, horizonte, based, on, the, analysis, of, luzia, and, her, people, s, cranial, morphology, it, was, theorized, that, they, had, australoid, features, having, belonged, to, a, population, that, arrived, in, the, americas, before, the, ancestors, of, amerindians, however, with, the, analysis, of, the, genetic, material, of, the, human, remains, of, the, lagoa, santa, people, it, was, found, that, this, prehistoric, population, had, completely, amerindian, dna, therefore, ruling, out, any, relationship, with, australasian, populations, and, the, theory, that, the, peopling, of, the, americas, was, due, to, a, wave, of, individuals, with, australoid, traits, and, another, of, mongoloid, individuals, the, indigenous, peoples, of, minas, gerais, as, well, as, throughout, brazil, and, south, america, are, descendants, of, the, groups, who, migrated, there, through, north, america, in, the, region, of, the, municipalities, of, janu, ria, montalv, nia, itacarambi, and, juven, lia, in, northern, minas, gerais, archaeological, excavations, have, led, to, estimates, that, the, initial, settlement, occurred, at, luzia, s, time, starting, in, this, period, cultural, characteristics, emerged, such, as, the, use, of, stone, or, bone, the, creation, of, cemeteries, and, small, grain, silos, as, well, as, cave, paintings, later, about, four, thousand, years, ago, it, is, speculated, that, vegetable, cultivation, occurred, in, particular, corn, and, that, two, thousand, years, ago, ceramic, products, were, already, being, manufactured, more, than, a, hundred, indigenous, groups, inhabited, the, current, territory, of, minas, gerais, at, the, time, of, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, the, valleys, of, the, doce, jequitinhonha, and, mucuri, rivers, people, generally, known, as, botocudos, lived, such, as, the, maxakalis, maconis, naquenuques, aran, s, krenaks, and, patax, s, northern, minas, gerais, was, dominated, by, the, kiriris, and, xakriab, s, center, western, and, southern, minas, gerais, were, inhabited, by, the, catagu, s, who, were, the, most, numerous, indigenous, group, in, minas, gerais, territory, in, colonial, times, so, much, so, that, the, region, was, known, as, campos, gerais, dos, cataguases, in, the, time, of, the, bandeirantes, the, regions, of, tri, ngulo, mineiro, and, alto, parana, ba, were, inhabited, by, the, kayapos, and, arax, s, while, the, zona, da, mata, was, populated, by, the, puri, the, region, of, minas, gerais, close, to, the, border, with, s, o, paulo, mato, grosso, do, sul, and, goi, s, was, occupied, by, the, boror, s, however, during, the, first, centuries, of, the, colonization, of, brazil, the, indigenous, people, of, this, region, were, captured, by, the, bandeirantes, to, be, enslaved, and, the, groups, that, revolted, were, exterminated, which, caused, a, great, reduction, in, the, indigenous, population, leaving, currently, only, five, groups, the, xakriab, s, krenaks, maxakalis, patax, s, and, pankararus, the, latter, coming, from, pernambuco, s, hinterlands, the, first, european, expedition, into, minas, gerais, territory, was, led, by, spaniards, francisco, bruza, espinosa, and, juan, de, azpilcueta, navarro, between, 1553, and, 1555, which, left, the, coast, of, bahia, and, traveled, through, northern, minas, gerais, in, the, following, decades, other, expeditions, known, as, entries, coming, from, the, brazil, s, northeastern, coast, traveled, through, this, same, region, such, as, that, of, sebasti, o, fernandes, tourinho, in, 1573, from, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, bandeirantes, traveled, the, territory, of, minas, gerais, in, search, of, gold, and, precious, stones, many, of, their, expeditions, were, supported, by, the, portuguese, crown, among, which, those, of, fern, o, dias, and, his, son, in, law, borba, gato, who, left, the, village, of, s, o, paulo, in, 1674, stand, out, in, the, 17th, century, the, colonization, of, northern, minas, gerais, began, with, the, settlement, of, cattle, herders, due, to, the, expansion, of, livestock, farming, in, the, northeastern, sert, o, and, of, bandeirantes, in, search, of, precious, stones, and, indigenous, people, to, enslave, between, 1692, and, 1693, the, bandeirante, ant, nio, rodrigues, arz, o, discovered, the, first, gold, deposits, in, the, territory, of, minas, gerais, in, the, following, years, bandeirantes, from, the, towns, of, s, o, paulo, and, taubat, traveled, through, the, das, velhas, region, looking, for, gold, in, 1696, salvador, fernandes, furtado, discovered, gold, on, the, banks, of, the, carmo, river, and, built, his, camp, there, which, gave, rise, to, the, town, of, nossa, senhora, do, carmo, now, mariana, two, years, later, ant, nio, dias, de, oliveira, discovered, gold, at, the, foot, of, the, itacolomi, peak, and, founded, his, settlement, there, the, embryo, of, vila, rica, currently, ouro, preto, in, 1702, jo, o, de, siqueira, afonso, discovered, precious, stones, in, the, rio, das, mortes, valley, initially, gold, was, extracted, from, riverbeds, which, forced, miners, to, move, as, the, deposits, ran, out, after, some, time, exploration, also, began, to, be, carried, out, on, mountain, slopes, which, forced, the, permanent, settlement, of, miners, leading, to, the, emergence, of, the, first, settlements, the, news, of, the, discovery, of, gold, soon, spread, initiating, a, gold, rush, and, in, the, following, decades, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, eager, for, wealth, mainly, portuguese, which, included, new, christians, but, also, colonial, brazilians, from, s, o, paulo, bahia, pernambuco, and, rio, de, janeiro, settled, in, minas, gerais, the, arrival, of, large, numbers, of, people, in, a, short, time, led, to, epidemics, and, food, shortages, in, 1697, the, portuguese, used, enslaved, african, labor, to, start, building, the, estrada, real, the, royal, road, that, would, connect, the, ports, of, cities, of, rio, de, janeiro, and, paraty, to, the, mineral, rich, regions, of, vila, rica, serro, and, at, the, northernmost, point, diamantina, s, o, paulo, settlers, considered, themselves, owners, of, the, gold, taken, from, the, mines, claiming, the, right, due, to, having, discovered, and, conquered, it, and, did, not, want, others, to, take, possession, of, the, mines, as, a, result, in, 1707, they, came, into, conflict, with, the, portuguese, and, other, brazilian, settlers, nicknamed, emboabas, a, tupi, term, that, means, one, who, offends, causing, the, war, of, the, emboabas, which, ended, in, 1709, the, s, o, paulo, settlers, were, defeated, and, many, of, them, had, to, abandon, the, gold, deposits, in, minas, gerais, having, to, look, for, the, metal, in, what, is, now, the, central, west, region, of, brazil, finding, it, years, later, in, goi, s, and, mato, grosso, prior, to, 1720, minas, gerais, was, part, of, the, captaincy, of, s, o, vicente, the, imposition, of, the, authority, of, the, portuguese, crown, contributed, to, the, end, of, the, conflict, with, the, creation, of, the, captaincy, of, s, o, paulo, and, minas, do, ouro, in, 1709, in, 1711, the, first, villages, were, created, in, minas, gerais, namely, sabar, vila, rica, and, vila, de, nossa, senhora, do, carmo, in, 1720, the, vila, rica, revolt, took, place, against, taxes, on, gold, and, as, a, result, that, same, year, the, captaincy, of, minas, gerais, was, created, after, the, dismemberment, of, s, o, paulo, e, minas, do, ouro, the, first, capital, of, minas, gerais, and, seat, of, the, local, see, was, the, city, of, mariana, it, was, later, moved, to, vila, rica, in, the, late, 18th, century, vila, rica, was, the, largest, city, in, brazil, and, one, of, the, most, populous, in, the, americas, the, portuguese, crown, then, began, to, strictly, control, the, mining, of, gold, instating, a, 20, tax, of, everything, that, was, produced, which, became, known, as, the, fifth, the, captaincy, s, population, continued, to, grow, but, until, then, there, were, only, small, subsistence, agricultural, crops, which, required, the, import, of, products, from, other, regions, of, the, colony, new, access, ways, to, the, region, began, to, be, created, and, the, flow, of, people, and, goods, increased, intensely, thus, creating, the, first, large, consumer, market, in, brazil, villages, appeared, along, these, access, points, therefore, playing, a, key, role, in, the, population, of, the, captaincy, among, these, routes, the, caminho, novo, stands, out, which, connected, the, mining, regions, to, rio, de, janeiro, the, intense, mix, of, people, associated, with, wealth, from, gold, and, urban, life, led, to, the, formation, of, a, new, culturally, diverse, society, with, several, musicians, artists, sculptors, and, artisans, among, the, cultural, movements, the, work, of, aleijadinho, and, master, ata, de, stands, out, among, others, which, allowed, the, flourishing, of, a, local, baroque, aleijadinho, s, sculptural, and, architectural, work, as, exhibited, in, the, twelve, prophets, and, the, church, of, saint, francis, of, assisi, in, ouro, preto, are, prime, examples, of, this, period, in, addition, to, art, and, architecture, there, was, an, explosion, of, musical, activity, in, minas, gerais, in, the, 18th, century, printed, copies, of, european, music, as, well, as, accomplished, musicians, made, the, journey, to, the, area, and, soon, a, local, school, of, composition, and, performance, was, born, and, achieved, considerable, sophistication, several, composers, worked, in, minas, gerais, in, the, 18th, century, mainly, in, vila, rica, sabar, mariana, and, other, cities, some, of, the, names, which, have, survived, include, jos, joaquim, emerico, lobo, de, mesquita, marcos, coelho, neto, francisco, gomes, da, rocha, and, ign, cio, parreiras, neves, they, cultivated, a, style, related, to, the, classical, european, style, but, marked, by, more, a, more, chordal, homophonic, sound, and, they, usually, wrote, for, mixed, groups, of, voices, and, instruments, in, the, 1720s, in, the, jequitinhonha, valley, region, the, discovery, of, diamonds, occurred, although, its, discoverers, did, not, recognize, the, value, of, this, precious, stone, for, decades, however, the, portuguese, crown, upon, recognizing, the, region, s, mineral, production, soon, established, a, way, of, charging, taxes, in, a, similar, way, to, the, gold, tax, the, main, diamond, exploration, center, was, close, to, where, arraial, do, tijuco, today, diamantina, emerged, at, the, height, of, gold, mining, enslaved, labor, was, essential, for, large, landowners, in, this, way, the, trade, in, slaves, brought, from, the, african, continent, to, work, in, the, mines, intensified, many, slaves, tried, and, managed, to, escape, which, led, to, the, emergence, of, quilombos, throughout, minas, gerais, it, is, estimated, that, during, the, 18th, century, more, than, 120, of, these, communities, emerged, throughout, the, captaincy, these, settlements, were, not, so, far, from, mining, centers, which, made, it, easier, for, more, slaves, to, escape, there, was, also, a, trade, in, subsistence, products, between, slaves, and, traders, who, took, advantage, of, the, lower, price, offered, by, the, former, in, 1753, rosa, egipc, aca, was, enslaved, and, forced, to, work, as, a, prostitute, in, a, mine, in, the, region, until, she, became, ill, and, began, to, have, religious, visions, these, visions, led, to, her, arrest, and, imprisonment, and, ultimately, interrogation, by, the, inquisition, she, recorded, them, in, the, first, book, to, be, written, by, a, black, woman, in, brazil, sagrada, teologia, do, amor, divino, das, almas, peregrinas, during, the, 18th, century, mining, exploration, was, strongly, controlled, by, the, portuguese, crown, which, imposed, heavy, taxes, on, everything, extracted, one, fifth, of, all, gold, would, go, to, the, crown, several, rebellions, were, attempted, by, the, colonists, always, facing, strong, reaction, by, the, imperial, crown, one, of, the, most, important, was, the, vila, rica, revolt, that, ended, with, the, execution, of, filipe, dos, santos, the, revolt, s, leader, but, also, with, the, separation, of, minas, gerais, from, the, captaincy, s, o, paulo, e, minas, de, ouro, the, most, notable, one, however, was, the, minas, gerais, conspiracy, started, in, 1789, by, a, group, of, middle, class, colonists, mostly, intellectuals, and, young, officers, they, were, inspired, by, the, american, and, french, enlightenment, ideals, the, conspiracy, failed, and, the, rebels, were, arrested, and, exiled, the, most, famous, of, them, joaquim, jos, da, silva, xavier, known, as, tiradentes, was, hanged, by, order, of, queen, maria, i, of, portugal, becoming, a, local, hero, and, a, national, martyr, of, brazil, the, minas, gerais, flag, a, red, triangle, on, a, white, background, along, with, the, latin, motto, libertas, qu, sera, tamen, freedom, albeit, late, is, based, on, the, design, for, the, national, flag, proposed, by, the, inconfidentes, as, the, rebels, became, known, in, the, economic, history, of, brazil, minas, gerais, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, shifting, the, economic, axis, from, the, brazilian, northeast, based, on, sugarcane, that, starts, declining, in, the, 18th, century, to, the, southeast, of, the, country, which, still, remains, the, major, economic, center, the, large, amounts, of, gold, found, in, the, region, attracted, the, attention, of, portugal, back, to, brazil, progressively, turning, rio, de, janeiro, into, an, important, port, city, from, where, these, would, be, shipped, to, portugal, and, where, the, portuguese, crown, would, eventually, move, its, administration, in, 1808, after, napoleon, bonaparte, s, invasion, of, portugal, see, transfer, of, the, portuguese, court, to, brazil, due, to, the, economic, importance, of, the, state, and, the, particular, traits, of, the, local, population, famed, for, its, reserved, and, balanced, character, minas, gerais, has, also, played, an, important, role, on, national, politics, during, the, 19th, century, politicians, such, as, jos, bonif, cio, de, andrada, e, silva, were, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, brazilian, empire, under, the, rule, of, pedro, i, and, later, his, son, pedro, ii, after, the, installation, of, the, first, brazilian, republic, during, the, early, 20th, century, minas, gerais, shared, the, control, of, the, national, political, scene, with, s, o, paulo, in, what, became, known, as, the, coffee, with, milk, politics, coffee, being, the, major, product, of, s, o, paulo, and, milk, representing, minas, gerais, dairy, industry, despite, the, latter, also, being, an, important, coffee, producer, minas, gerais, was, also, home, to, two, of, the, most, influential, brazilian, politicians, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, juscelino, kubitschek, was, president, from, 1956, to, 1961, and, he, was, responsible, for, the, construction, of, bras, lia, as, the, new, capital, of, brazil, tancredo, neves,

hydroelectric, power, plants, including, furnas, some, of, the, highest, peaks, in, brazil, are, in, the, mountain, ranges, in, the, southern, part, of, the, state, such, as, the, mantiqueira, mountains, and, serra, do, cervo, that, mark, the, border, between, minas, and, its, neighbors, s, o, paulo, and, rio, de, janeiro, the, most, notable, one, is, the, bandeira, peak, the, third, highest, mountain, in, brazil, at, 2, 890, m, standing, on, the, border, with, esp, rito, santo, state, the, state, also, has, huge, reserves, of, iron, and, sizeable, reserves, of, gold, and, gemstones, including, emerald, topaz, and, aquamarine, mines, emeralds, found, in, this, location, are, comparable, to, the, best, colombia, origin, emeralds, and, are, most, often, a, bluish, green, color, each, region, of, the, state, has, a, distinct, character, geographically, and, to, a, certain, extent, culturally, according, to, the, modern, 2017, geographic, classification, by, brazil, s, national, institute, of, geography, and, statistics, ibge, which, succeeded, the, division, in, mesoregions, and, microregions, 1988, the, state, is, now, divided, in, 13, intermediate, geographic, regions, each, one, divided, in, immediate, geographic, regions, 70, total, in, the, whole, state, the, discovery, of, the, maxakalisaurus, topai, dinoprata, fossils, was, a, significant, paleontological, find, the, fossil, is, a, genus, of, titanosaurid, dinosaur, found, 45, kilometers, 28, mi, from, the, city, of, prata, in, the, state, of, minas, gerais, in, 1998, it, was, closely, related, to, saltasaurus, a, sauropod, considered, unusual, because, it, had, evolved, apparently, defensive, traits, including, bony, plates, on, its, skin, and, vertical, plates, along, its, spine, such, osteoderms, have, also, been, found, for, maxakalisaurus, the, genus, name, is, derived, from, the, tribe, of, the, maxakali, the, maxakalisaurus, fossils, belonged, to, an, animal, about, 13, meters, 43, 3, ft, long, with, an, estimated, weight, of, 9, tons, although, according, to, paleontologist, alexander, kellner, it, could, reach, a, length, of, approximately, 20, meters, 65, ft, it, had, a, long, neck, and, tail, ridged, teeth, unusual, among, sauropods, and, lived, about, 80, million, years, ago, because, sauropods, seem, to, have, lacked, significant, competition, in, south, america, they, evolved, there, with, greater, diversity, and, more, unusual, traits, than, elsewhere, in, the, world, a, replica, has, been, displayed, at, the, national, museum, of, brazil, since, august, 28, 2006, in, the, 1940s, fossil, records, from, the, late, cretaceous, period, began, to, be, unearthed, in, the, territory, of, uberaba, many, of, them, exceptionally, well, preserved, subsequently, extensive, research, efforts, were, initiated, by, the, national, department, of, mineral, production, dnpm, which, appointed, paleontologist, llewellyn, ivor, price, to, work, in, the, region, due, to, the, large, quantity, of, fossils, uncovered, the, paleontological, research, center, llewellyn, ivor, price, was, established, in, 1991, alongside, the, dinosaurs, museum, in, peir, polis, which, is, currently, dedicated, to, the, study, of, local, paleontology, in, collaboration, with, research, institutions, worldwide, in, march, 2024, uberaba, was, officially, designated, as, a, unesco, global, geopark, marking, it, as, the, first, of, its, kind, in, minas, gerais, the, territory, is, situated, within, the, serra, da, galga, formation, where, more, than, 10, 000, fossils,

included, european, genes, account, for, the, majority, of, the, minas, gerais, genetic, heritage, which, has, been, explained, on, the, basis, of, the, extremely, high, mortality, rates, of, the,
