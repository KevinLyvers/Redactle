form, zi, park, and, judea, human, habitation, of, the, isfahan, region, can, be, traced, back, to, the, palaeolithic, period, archaeologists, have, recently, found, artifacts, dating, back, to, the, palaeolithic, mesolithic, neolithic, bronze, and, iron, ages, what, became, the, city, of, isfahan, likely, emerged, and, gradually, developed, over, the, course, of, the, elamite, civilisation, 2700, 1600, bce, under, median, rule, a, commercial, entrep, t, began, to, show, signs, of, more, sedentary, urbanism, steadily, growing, into, a, noteworthy, regional, center, that, benefited, from, the, exceptionally, fertile, soil, on, the, banks, of, the, zayandehrud, river, in, a, region, called, aspandana, or, ispandana, when, cyrus, the, great, unified, persian, and, median, lands, into, the, achaemenid, empire, the, religiously, and, ethnically, diverse, city, of, isfahan, became, an, early, example, of, the, king, s, fabled, religious, tolerance, it, was, cyrus, who, having, just, taken, babylon, made, an, edict, in, 538, bce, declaring, that, jews, in, babylon, could, return, to, jerusalem, later, some, of, the, jew, immigrants, settled, in, isfahan, instead, of, returning, to, their, homeland, the, 10th, century, persian, historian, ibn, al, faqih, wrote, when, the, jews, emigrated, from, jerusalem, fleeing, from, nebuchadnezzar, they, carried, with, them, a, sample, of, the, water, and, soil, of, jerusalem, they, did, not, settle, until, they, reached, the, city, of, isfahan, whose, soil, and, water, was, deemed, to, resemble, that, of, jerusalem, thereupon, they, settled, there, cultivated, the, soil, raised, children, and, grandchildren, and, today, the, name, of, this, settlement, is, yahudia, the, parthians, 247, bce, 224, ce, continued, the, tradition, of, tolerance, after, the, fall, of, the, achaemenids, fostering, a, hellenistic, dimension, within, iranian, culture, and, the, political, organization, introduced, by, alexander, the, great, s, invading, armies, under, the, parthians, arsacid, governors, administered, the, provinces, of, the, nation, from, isfahan, and, the, city, s, urban, development, accelerated, to, accommodate, the, needs, of, a, capital, city, the, next, empire, to, rule, the, sassanids, 224, 651, ce, presided, over, massive, changes, in, their, realm, instituting, sweeping, agricultural, reforms, and, reviving, iranian, culture, and, the, zoroastrian, religion, both, the, city, and, region, were, then, called, by, the, name, aspahan, or, spahan, the, city, was, governed, by, a, group, called, the, espoohrans, who, descended, from, seven, noble, iranian, families, extant, foundations, of, some, sassanid, era, bridges, in, isfahan, suggest, that, the, sasanian, kings, were, fond, of, ambitious, urban, planning, projects, while, isfahan, s, political, importance, declined, during, this, period, many, sassanid, princes, would, study, statecraft, in, the, city, and, its, military, role, increased, its, strategic, location, at, the, intersection, of, the, ancient, roads, to, susa, and, persepolis, made, it, an, ideal, candidate, to, house, a, standing, army, which, would, be, ready, to, march, against, constantinople, at, any, moment, the, words, aspahan, and, spahan, are, derived, from, the, pahlavi, or, middle, persian, meaning, the, place, of, the, army, although, many, theories, have, mentioned, the, origins, of, isfahan, little, is, known, of, it, before, the, rule, of, the, sasanian, dynasty, the, historical, facts, suggest, that, in, the, late, 4th, and, early, 5th, centuries, queen, shushandukht, the, jew, consort, of, yazdegerd, i, reigned, 399, 420, settled, a, colony, of, jew, immigrants, in, yahudiyyeh, also, spelled, yahudiya, a, settlement, 3, kilometres, 1, 9, mi, northwest, of, the, zoroastrian, city, of, gabae, its, achaemid, and, parthian, name, gabai, was, its, sasanic, name, which, was, shortened, to, gay, arabic, jay, that, was, located, on, the, northern, bank, of, the, zayanderud, river, the, colony, s, establishment, was, also, attributed, to, nebuchadrezzar, though, that, s, less, likely, the, gradual, population, decrease, of, gay, jay, and, the, simultaneous, population, increase, of, yahudiyyeh, and, its, suburbs, after, the, arab, conquest, of, iran, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, nucleus, of, what, was, to, become, the, city, of, isfahan, the, words, aspadana, ispadana, spahan, and, sepahan, all, from, which, the, word, isfahan, is, derived, referred, to, the, region, in, which, the, city, was, located, isfahan, and, gay, were, supposedly, both, circular, in, design, which, was, characteristic, of, parthian, and, sasanian, cities, however, this, reported, sasanian, circular, city, of, isfahan, has, not, yet, been, uncovered, when, the, arabs, captured, isfahan, in, 642, they, made, it, the, capital, of, al, jibal, the, mountains, province, an, area, that, covered, much, of,
