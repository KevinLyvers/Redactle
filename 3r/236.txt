remains, the, sole, official, language, since, 1946, r, union, has, been, governed, as, a, french, region, and, thus, has, a, similar, status, to, its, counterparts, in, metropolitan, france, consequently, it, is, one, of, the, outermost, regions, of, the, european, union, and, part, of, the, eurozone, it, is, along, with, the, french, overseas, department, of, mayotte, one, of, the, two,

7, march, 1848, in, accordance, with, the, original, spelling, and, the, classical, spelling, and, typographical, rules, la, r, union, was, written, with, a, lower, case, in, the, article, but, during, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, spelling, la, r, union, with, a, capital, letter, was, developed, in, many, writings, to, emphasize, the, integration, of, the, article, in, the, name, this, last, spelling, corresponds, to, the, recommendations, of, the, commission, nationale, de, toponymie, and, appears, in, the, current, constitution, of, the, french, republic, in, articles, 72,

on, a, map, from, 1153, ad, by, al, sharif, el, edrisi, the, island, might, also, have, been, visited, by, swahili, or, austronesian, ancient, indonesian, malaysian, sailors, on, their, journey, to, the, west, from, the, malay, archipelago, to, madagascar, the, first, european, discovery, of, the, area, was, made, around, 1507, by, portuguese, explorer, diogo, fernandes, pereira, but, the, specifics, are, unclear, the, uninhabited, island, might, have, been, first, sighted, by, the, expedition, led, by, dom, pedro, mascarenhas, who, gave, his, name, to, the, island, group, around, r, union, the, mascarenes, r, union, itself, was, dubbed, santa, apol, nia, after, a, favourite, saint, which, suggests, that, the, date, of, the, portuguese, discovery, could, have, been, 9, february, her, feast, day, diogo, lopes, de, sequeira, is, said, to, have, landed, on, the, islands, of, r, union, and, rodrigues, in, 1509, by, the, early, 1600s, nominal, portuguese, rule, had, left, santa, apol, nia, virtually, untouched, the, island, was, then, occupied, by, france, and, administered, from, port, louis, mauritius, although, the, first, french, claims, date, from, 1638, when, fran, ois,

to, ethnic, diversity, in, the, population, from, 1690, most, of, the, non, europeans, on, the, island, were, enslaved, of, the, 80, 000, slaves, imported, to, r, union, and, mauritius, between, 1769,

as, by, le, de, france, mauritius, a, delegation, accompanied, by, military, forces, charged, with, imposing, the, liberation, of, slaves, arrived, on, the, island, of, bourbon, on, 18, june, 1796, only, to, be, immediately, expelled, without, mercy, there, followed, a, period, of, unrest, and, challenges, to, the, power, of, the, metropolis, which, no, longer, had, any, authority, over, the, two, islands, the, first, consul, of, the, republic, napoleon, bonaparte, maintained, slavery, there, which, was, never, abolished, in, practice, with, the, law, of, 20, may, 1802, on, 26, september, 1806, the, island, took, the, name, of, bonaparte, and, found, itself, in, the, front, line, of, the, franco, british, conflict, for, the, control, of, the, indian, ocean, following, climatic, catastrophes, of, 1806, 1807, cyclones, floods, coffee, cultivation, declined, rapidly, and, was, replaced, by, sugar, cane, whose, demand, in, france, increased, due, to, france, s, recent, loss, of, saint, domingue, and, soon, of, the, le, de, france, mauritius, because, of, its, growth, cycle, sugarcane, is, not, affected, by, cyclones, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, island, was, invaded, by, british, forces, and, its, governor, general, sainte, suzanne, was, forced, to, capitulate, on, 9, july, 1810, the, island, then, came, under, british, rule, and, was, under, british, occupation, until, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, period, la, r, union, was, returned, to, the, french, under, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1814, the, slave, trade, operated, openly, again, after, the, british, occupation, and, despite, international, condemnation, la, r, union, imported, 2, 000, slaves, every, month, during, the, 1820s, mostly, from, the, arab, swahili, coast, or, quelimane, in, portuguese,

replaced, by, a, system, of, contract, labor, known, as, engag, s, which, lasted, from, 1848, until, 1864, in, practice, an, illegal, slave, trade, was, conducted, in, which, slaves, were, acquired, from, portuguese, mozambique, and, the, zanzibar, slave, trade, and, then, trafficked, to, r, union, via, the, comoros, slave, trade, officially, called, engag, s, workers, to, avoid, the, british, anti, slavery, patrol, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, reduced, the, importance, of, the, island, as, a, stopover, on, the, east, indies, trade, route, and, caused, a, shift, in, commercial, traffic, away, from, the, island, europe, increasingly, turned, to, sugar, beet, to, meet, its, sugar, needs, despite, the, development, policy, of, the, local, authorities, and, the, recourse, to, compromise, the, economic, crisis, became, evident, from, the, 1870s, onwards, however, this, economic, depression, did, not, prevent, the, modernization, of, the, island, with, the, development, of, the, road, network, the, creation, of, the, railroad, and, the, construction, of, the, artificial, harbor, of, the, pointe, des, galets, these, major, construction, projects, offered, a, welcome, alternative, for, agricultural, workers, during, the, second, world, war, r, union, was, under, the, authority, of, the, vichy, regime, until, 30, november, 1942, when, free, french,

the, time, many, of, these, children, were, abused, or, disadvantaged, by, the, families, with, whom, they, were, placed, known, as, the, children, of, creuse, they, and, their, fate, came, to, light, in, 2002, when, one, of, them, jean, jacques, martial, filed, suit, against, the, french, state, for, kidnapping, and, deportation, of, a, minor, other, similar, lawsuits, were, filed, over, the,

the, departments, and, regions, of, metropolitan, france, albeit, with, some, adaptations, article, 73, of, the, constitution, provides, for, the, possibility, of, replacing, the, region, and, the, department, by, a, single, territorial, entity, but, unlike, french, guiana, or, martinique, there, are, currently, no, plans, to, do, so, unlike, the, other, droms, the, constitution, explicitly, excludes, r, union, from, the, possibility, of, receiving, authorization, from, parliament, to, set, certain, rules, itself, either, by, law, or, by, the, national, executive, the, state, is,

de, la, fournaise, is, one, of, earth, s, most, active, volcanoes, the, piton, des, neiges, is, dormant, its, name, is, french, for, peak, of, snows, but, snowfall, on, the, summit, of, the, mountain, is, rare, the, slopes, of, both, volcanoes, are, heavily, forested, cultivated, land, and, cities, like, the, capital, city, of, saint, denis, are, concentrated, on, the, surrounding, coastal,

des, neiges, volcano, it, has, an, altitude, of, 3, 070, 5, m, 10, 074, ft, the, highest, peak, in, the, mascarene, islands, and, the, indian, ocean, the, eastern, part, of, the, island, is, constituted, by, the, piton, de, la, fournaise, a, much, more, recent, volcano, 500, 000, years, old, which, is, considered, one, of, the, most, active, on, the, planet, the, emerged, part, of, the, island, represents, only, a, small, percentage, about, 3, of, the, underwater, mountain, that, forms, it, in, addition, to, volcanism, the, relief, of, the, island, is, very, uneven, due, to, active, erosion, the, center, shelters, three, vast, cirques, dug, by, erosion, salazie, mafate, and, cilaos, and, the, slopes, of, the, island, are, furrowed, by, numerous, rivers, digging, gullies, estimated, at, least, 600, generally, deep, and, whose, torrents, cut, the, sides, of, the, mountains, up, to, several, hundreds, of, meters, deep, the, ancient, massif, of, the, piton, des, neiges, is, separated, from, the, massif, of, la, fournaise, by, a, gap, formed, by, the, plaine, des, palmistes, and, the, plaine, des, cafres, a, passageway, between, the, east, and, the, south, of, the, island, apart, from, the, plains, the, coastal, areas, are, generally, the, flattest, regions, especially, in, the, north, and, west, of, the, island, the, coastline, of, the, wild, south, is, however, steeper, between, the, coastal, fringe, and, the, hauts, there, is, a, steep, transitional, zone, whose, gradient, varies, considerably, before, arriving, at, the, ridge, lines, setting, the, cirques, or, the, enclos, the, caldera, of, the, piton, de, la, fournaise, la, r, union, is, characterized, by, a, humid, tropical, climate, tempered, by, the, oceanic, influence, of, the, trade, winds, blowing, from, east, to, west, the, climate, of, r, union, is, characterized, by, its, great, variability, mainly, due, to, the, imposing, relief, of, the, island, which, is, at, the, origin, of, numerous, microclimates, as, a, result, there, are, strong, disparities, in, rainfall, between, the, windward, coast, in, the, east, and, the, leeward, coast, in, the, west, and, in, temperature,

diversity, a, very, high, rate, of, endemism, and, a, very, specific, structure, the, flora, of, la, r, union, presents, a, great, diversity, of, natural, environments, and, species, up, to, 40, tree, species, ha, compared, to, a, temperate, forest, which, has, an, average, of, 5, ha, this, diversity, is, even, more, remarkable, but, fragile, as, it, differs, according, to, the, environment, coastal, low, medium, and, high, mountain, la, r, union, has, a, very, high, rate, of, endemic, species, with, more, than, 850, native, plants, of, natural, origin, and, present, before, the, arrival, of, humans, of, which, 232, are, endemic, to, the, la, r, union, only, present, on, the, island, as, well, as, numerous, species, endemic, to, the, mascarene, archipelago, finally, the, flora, of, la, r, union, is, distinguished, from, that, of, equatorial, tropical, forests, by, the, low, height, and, density, of, the, canopy, probably, due, to, adaptation, to, cyclones, and, by, a, very, specific, vegetation, in, particular, a, strong, presence, of, epiphytic, plants, growing, on, other, plants, such, as, orchids, bromeliads, and, cacti, but, also, ferns, lichens, and, mosses, like, its, prodigious, floral, diversity, r, union, is, home, to, a, variety, of, birds, such, as, the, white, tailed, tropicbird, french, paille, en, queue, many, of, these, birds, species, are, endemic,
