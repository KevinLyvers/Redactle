in, cartography, a, map, projection, is, any, of, a, broad, set, of, transformations, employed, to, represent, the, curved, two, dimensional, surface, of, a, globe, on, a, plane, in, a, map, projection, coordinates, often, expressed, as, latitude, and, longitude, of, locations, from, the, surface, of, the, globe, are, transformed, to, coordinates, on, a, plane, projection, is, a, necessary, step, in, creating, a, two, dimensional, map, and, is, one, of, the, essential, elements, of, cartography, all, projections, of, a, sphere, on, a, plane, necessarily, distort, the, surface, in, some, way, depending, on, the, purpose, of, the, map, some, distortions, are, acceptable, and, others, are, not, therefore, different, map, projections, exist, in, order, to, preserve, some, properties, of, the, sphere, like, body, at, the, expense, of, other, properties, the, study, of, map, projections, is, primarily, about, the, characterization, of, their, distortions, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, possible, map, projections, 1, more, generally, projections, are, considered, in, several, fields, of, pure, mathematics, including, differential, geometry, projective, geometry, and, manifolds, however, the, term, map, projection, refers, specifically, to, a, cartographic, projection, despite, the, name, s, literal, meaning, projection, is, not, limited, to, perspective, projections, such, as, those, resulting, from, casting, a, shadow, on, a, screen, or, the, rectilinear, image, produced, by, a, pinhole, camera, on, a, flat, film, plate, rather, any, mathematical, function, that, transforms, coordinates, from, the, curved, surface, distinctly, and, smoothly, to, the, plane, is, a, projection, few, projections, in, practical, use, are, perspective, most, of, this, article, assumes, that, the, surface, to, be, mapped, is, that, of, a, sphere, the, earth, and, other, large, celestial, bodies, are, generally, better, modeled, as, oblate, spheroids, whereas, small, objects, such, as, asteroids, often, have, irregular, shapes, the, surfaces, of, planetary, bodies, can, be, mapped, even, if, they, are, too, irregular, to, be, modeled, well, with, a, sphere, or, ellipsoid, therefore, more, generally, a, map, projection, is, any, method, of, flattening, a, continuous, curved, surface, onto, a, plane, the, most, well, known, map, projection, is, the, mercator, projection, 45, this, map, projection, has, the, property, of, being, conformal, however, it, has, been, criticized, throughout, the, 20th, century, for, enlarging, regions, further, from, the, equator, 156, 157, to, contrast, equal, area, projections, such, as, the, sinusoidal, projection, and, the, gall, peters, projection, show, the, correct, sizes, of, countries, relative, to, each, other, but, distort, angles, the, national, geographic, society, and, most, atlases, favor, map, projections, that, compromise, between, area, and, angular, distortion, such, as, the, robinson, projection, and, the, winkel, tripel, projection, many, properties, can, be, measured, on, the, earth, s, surface, independently, of, its, geography, map, projections, can, be, constructed, to, preserve, some, of, these, properties, at, the, expense, of, others, because, the, earth, s, curved, surface, is, not, isometric, to, a, plane, preservation, of, shapes, inevitably, requires, a, variable, scale, and, consequently, non, proportional, presentation, of, areas, similarly, an, area, preserving, projection, can, not, be, conformal, resulting, in, shapes, and, bearings, distorted, in, most, places, of, the, map, each, projection, preserves, compromises, or, approximates, basic, metric, properties, in, different, ways, the, purpose, of, the, map, determines, which, projection, should, form, the, base, for, the, map, because, maps, have, many, different, purposes, a, diversity, of, projections, have, been, created, to, suit, those, purposes, another, consideration, in, the, configuration, of, a, projection, is, its, compatibility, with, data, sets, to, be, used, on, the, map, data, sets, are, geographic, information, their, collection, depends, on, the, chosen, datum, model, of, the, earth, different, datums, assign, slightly, different, coordinates, to, the, same, location, so, in, large, scale, maps, such, as, those, from, national, mapping, systems, it, is, important, to, match, the, datum, to, the, projection, the, slight, differences, in, coordinate, assignation, between, different, datums, is, not, a, concern, for, world, maps, or, those, of, large, regions, where, such, differences, are, reduced, to, imperceptibility, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, theorema, egregium, proved, that, a, sphere, s, surface, cannot, be, represented, on, a, plane, without, distortion, the, same, applies, to, other, reference, surfaces, used, as, models, for, the, earth, such, as, oblate, spheroids, ellipsoids, and, geoids, since, any, map, projection, is, a, representation, of, one, of, those, surfaces, on, a, plane, all, map, projections, distort, the, classical, way, of, showing, the, distortion, inherent, in, a, projection, is, to, use, tissot, s, indicatrix, for, a, given, point, using, the, scale, factor, h, along, the, meridian, the, scale, factor, k, along, the, parallel, and, the, angle, between, them, nicolas, tissot, described, how, to, construct, an, ellipse, that, illustrates, the, amount, and, orientation, of, the, components, of, distortion, 147, 149, 24, by, spacing, the, ellipses, regularly, along, the, meridians, and, parallels, the, network, of, indicatrices, shows, how, distortion, varies, across, the, map, many, other, ways, have, been, described, of, showing, the, distortion, in, projections, like, tissot, s, indicatrix, the, goldberg, gott, indicatrix, is, based, on, infinitesimals, and, depicts, flexion, and, skewness, bending, and, lopsidedness, distortions, rather, than, the, original, enlarged, infinitesimal, circle, as, in, tissot, s, indicatrix, some, visual, methods, project, finite, shapes, that, span, a, part, of, the, map, for, example, a, small, circle, of, fixed, radius, e, g, 15, degrees, angular, radius, sometimes, spherical, triangles, are, used, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, projecting, a, human, head, onto, different, projections, was, common, to, show, how, distortion, varies, across, one, projection, as, compared, to, another, in, dynamic, media, shapes, of, familiar, coastlines, and, boundaries, can, be, dragged, across, an, interactive, map, to, show, how, the, projection, distorts, sizes, and, shapes, according, to, position, on, the, map, another, way, to, visualize, local, distortion, is, through, grayscale, or, color, gradations, whose, shade, represents, the, magnitude, of, the, angular, deformation, or, areal, inflation, sometimes, both, are, shown, simultaneously, by, blending, two, colors, to, create, a, bivariate, map, to, measure, distortion, globally, across, areas, instead, of, at, just, a, single, point, necessarily, involves, choosing, priorities, to, reach, a, compromise, some, schemes, use, distance, distortion, as, a, proxy, for, the, combination, of, angular, deformation, and, areal, inflation, such, methods, arbitrarily, choose, what, paths, to, measure, and, how, to, weight, them, in, order, to, yield, a, single, result, many, have, been, described, the, creation, of, a, map, projection, involves, two, steps, some, of, the, simplest, map, projections, are, literal, projections, as, obtained, by, placing, a, light, source, at, some, definite, point, relative, to, the, globe, and, projecting, its, features, onto, a, specified, surface, although, most, projections, are, not, defined, in, this, way, picturing, the, light, source, globe, model, can, be, helpful, in, understanding, the, basic, concept, of, a, map, projection, a, surface, that, can, be, unfolded, or, unrolled, into, a, plane, or, sheet, without, stretching, tearing, or, shrinking, is, called, a, developable, surface, the, cylinder, cone, and, the, plane, are, all, developable, surfaces, the, sphere, and, ellipsoid, do, not, have, developable, surfaces, so, any, projection, of, them, onto, a, plane, will, have, to, distort, the, image, to, compare, one, cannot, flatten, an, orange, peel, without, tearing, and, warping, it, one, way, of, describing, a, projection, is, first, to, project, from, the, earth, s, surface, to, a, developable, surface, such, as, a, cylinder, or, cone, and, then, to, unroll, the, surface, into, a, plane, while, the, first, step, inevitably, distorts, some, properties, of, the, globe, the, developable, surface, can, then, be, unfolded, without, further, distortion, once, a, choice, is, made, between, projecting, onto, a, cylinder, cone, or, plane, the, aspect, of, the, shape, must, be, specified, the, aspect, describes, how, the, developable, surface, is, placed, relative, to, the, globe, it, may, be, normal, such, that, the, surface, s, axis, of, symmetry, coincides, with, the, earth, s, axis, transverse, at, right, angles, to, the, earth, s, axis, or, oblique, any, angle, in, between, the, developable, surface, may, also, be, either, tangent, or, secant, to, the, sphere, or, ellipsoid, tangent, means, the, surface, touches, but, does, not, slice, through, the, globe, secant, means, the, surface, does, slice, through, the, globe, moving, the, developable, surface, away, from, contact, with, the, globe, never, preserves, or, optimizes, metric, properties, so, that, possibility, is, not, discussed, further, here, tangent, and, secant, lines, standard, lines, are, represented, undistorted, if, these, lines, are, a, parallel, of, latitude, as, in, conical, projections, it, is, called, a, standard, parallel, the, central, meridian, is, the, meridian, to, which, the, globe, is, rotated, before, projecting, the, central, meridian, usually, written, 0, and, a, parallel, of, origin, usually, written, 0, are, often, used, to, define, the, origin, of, the, map, projection, a, globe, is, the, only, way, to, represent, the, earth, with, constant, scale, throughout, the, entire, map, in, all, directions, a, map, cannot, achieve, that, property, for, any, area, no, matter, how, small, it, can, however, achieve, constant, scale, along, specific, lines, some, possible, properties, are, projection, construction, is, also, affected, by, how, the, shape, of, the, earth, or, planetary, body, is, approximated, in, the, following, section, on, projection, categories, the, earth, is, taken, as, a, sphere, in, order, to, simplify, the, discussion, however, the, earth, s, actual, shape, is, closer, to, an, oblate, ellipsoid, whether, spherical, or, ellipsoidal, the, principles, discussed, hold, without, loss, of, generality, selecting, a, model, for, a, shape, of, the, earth, involves, choosing, between, the, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, a, sphere, versus, an, ellipsoid, spherical, models, are, useful, for, small, scale, maps, such, as, world, atlases, and, globes, since, the, error, at, that, scale, is, not, usually, noticeable, or, important, enough, to, justify, using, the, more, complicated, ellipsoid, the, ellipsoidal, model, is, commonly, used, to, construct, topographic, maps, and, for, other, large, and, medium, scale, maps, that, need, to, accurately, depict, the, land, surface, auxiliary, latitudes, are, often, employed, in, projecting, the, ellipsoid, a, third, model, is, the, geoid, a, more, complex, and, accurate, representation, of, earth, s, shape, coincident, with, what, mean, sea, level, would, be, if, there, were, no, winds, tides, or, land, compared, to, the, best, fitting, ellipsoid, a, geoidal, model, would, change, the, characterization, of, important, properties, such, as, distance, conformality, and, equivalence, therefore, in, geoidal, projections, that, preserve, such, properties, the, mapped, graticule, would, deviate, from, a, mapped, ellipsoid, s, graticule, normally, the, geoid, is, not, used, as, an, earth, model, for, projections, however, because, earth, s, shape, is, very, regular, with, the, undulation, of, the, geoid, amounting, to, less, than, 100, m, from, the, ellipsoidal, model, out, of, the, 6, 3, million, m, earth, radius, for, irregular, planetary, bodies, such, as, asteroids, however, sometimes, models, analogous, to, the, geoid, are, used, to, project, maps, from, other, regular, solids, are, sometimes, used, as, generalizations, for, smaller, bodies, geoidal, equivalent, for, example, io, is, better, modeled, by, triaxial, ellipsoid, or, prolated, spheroid, with, small, eccentricities, haumea, s, shape, is, a, jacobi, ellipsoid, with, its, major, axis, twice, as, long, as, its, minor, and, with, its, middle, axis, one, and, half, times, as, long, as, its, minor, see, map, projection, of, the, triaxial, ellipsoid, for, further, information, one, way, to, classify, map, projections, is, based, on, the, type, of, surface, onto, which, the, globe, is, projected, in, this, scheme, the, projection, process, is, described, as, placing, a, hypothetical, projection, surface, the, size, of, the, desired, study, area, in, contact, with, part, of, the, earth, transferring, features, of, the, earth, s, surface, onto, the, projection, surface, then, unraveling, and, scaling, the, projection, surface, into, a, flat, map, the, most, common, projection, surfaces, are, cylindrical, e, g, mercator, conic, e, g, albers, and, planar, e, g, stereographic, many, mathematical, projections, however, do, not, neatly, fit, into, any, of, these, three, projection, methods, hence, other, peer, categories, have, been, described, in, the, literature, such, as, pseudoconic, pseudocylindrical, pseudoazimuthal, retroazimuthal, and, polyconic, another, way, to, classify, projections, is, according, to, properties, of, the, model, they, preserve, some, of, the, more, common, categories, are, because, the, sphere, is, not, a, developable, surface, it, is, impossible, to, construct, a, map, projection, that, is, both, equal, area, and, conformal, the, three, developable, surfaces, plane, cylinder, cone, provide, useful, models, for, understanding, describing, and, developing, map, projections, however, these, models, are, limited, in, two, fundamental, ways, for, one, thing, most, world, projections, in, use, do, not, fall, into, any, of, those, categories, for, another, thing, even, most, projections, that, do, fall, into, those, categories, are, not, naturally, attainable, through, physical, projection, as, l, p, lee, notes, no, reference, has, been, made, in, the, above, definitions, to, cylinders, cones, or, planes, the, projections, are, termed, cylindric, or, conic, because, they, can, be, regarded, as, developed, on, a, cylinder, or, a, cone, as, the, case, may, be, but, it, is, as, well, to, dispense, with, picturing, cylinders, and, cones, since, they, have, given, rise, to, much, misunderstanding, particularly, is, this, so, with, regard, to, the, conic, projections, with, two, standard, parallels, they, may, be, regarded, as, developed, on, cones, but, they, are, cones, which, bear, no, simple, relationship, to, the, sphere, in, reality, cylinders, and, cones, provide, us, with, convenient, descriptive, terms, but, little, else, lee, s, objection, refers, to, the, way, the, terms, cylindrical, conic, and, planar, azimuthal, have, been, abstracted, in, the, field, of, map, projections, if, maps, were, projected, as, in, light, shining, through, a, globe, onto, a, developable, surface, then, the, spacing, of, parallels, would, follow, a, very, limited, set, of, possibilities, such, a, cylindrical, projection, for, example, is, one, which, if, you, rotate, the, globe, before, projecting, then, the, parallels, and, meridians, will, not, necessarily, still, be, straight, lines, rotations, are, normally, ignored, for, the, purpose, of, classification, where, the, light, source, emanates, along, the, line, described, in, this, last, constraint, is, what, yields, the, differences, between, the, various, natural, cylindrical, projections, but, the, term, cylindrical, as, used, in, the, field, of, map, projections, relaxes, the, last, constraint, entirely, instead, the, parallels, can, be, placed, according, to, any, algorithm, the, designer, has, decided, suits, the, needs, of, the, map, the, famous, mercator, projection, is, one, in, which, the, placement, of, parallels, does, not, arise, by, projection, instead, parallels, are, placed, how, they, need, to, be, in, order, to, satisfy, the, property, that, a, course, of, constant, bearing, is, always, plotted, as, a, straight, line, a, normal, cylindrical, projection, is, any, projection, in, which, meridians, are, mapped, to, equally, spaced, vertical, lines, and, circles, of, latitude, parallels, are, mapped, to, horizontal, lines, the, mapping, of, meridians, to, vertical, lines, can, be, visualized, by, imagining, a, cylinder, whose, axis, coincides, with, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, this, cylinder, is, wrapped, around, the, earth, projected, onto, and, then, unrolled, by, the, geometry, of, their, construction, cylindrical, projections, stretch, distances, east, west, the, amount, of, stretch, is, the, same, at, any, chosen, latitude, on, all, cylindrical, projections, and, is, given, by, the, secant, of, the, latitude, as, a, multiple, of, the, equator, s, scale, the, various, cylindrical, projections, are, distinguished, from, each, other, solely, by, their, north, south, stretching, where, latitude, is, given, by, in, the, first, case, mercator, the, east, west, scale, always, equals, the, north, south, scale, in, the, second, case, central, cylindrical, the, north, south, scale, exceeds, the, east, west, scale, everywhere, away, from, the, equator, each, remaining, case, has, a, pair, of, secant, lines, a, pair, of, identical, latitudes, of, opposite, sign, or, else, the, equator, at, which, the, east, west, scale, matches, the, north, south, scale, normal, cylindrical, projections, map, the, whole, earth, as, a, finite, rectangle, except, in, the, first, two, cases, where, the, rectangle, stretches, infinitely, tall, while, retaining, constant, width, a, transverse, cylindrical, projection, is, a, cylindrical, projection, that, in, the, tangent, case, uses, a, great, circle, along, a, meridian, as, contact, line, for, the, cylinder, see, transverse, mercator, an, oblique, cylindrical, projection, aligns, with, a, great, circle, but, not, the, equator, and, not, a, meridian, pseudocylindrical, projections, represent, the, central, meridian, as, a, straight, line, segment, other, meridians, are, longer, than, the, central, meridian, and, bow, outward, away, from, the, central, meridian, pseudocylindrical, projections, map, parallels, as, straight, lines, along, parallels, each, point, from, the, surface, is, mapped, at, a, distance, from, the, central, meridian, that, is, proportional, to, its, difference, in, longitude, from, the, central, meridian, therefore, meridians, are, equally, spaced, along, a, given, parallel, on, a, pseudocylindrical, map, any, point, further, from, the, equator, than, some, other, point, has, a, higher, latitude, than, the, other, point, preserving, north, south, relationships, this, trait, is, useful, when, illustrating, phenomena, that, depend, on, latitude, such, as, climate, examples, of, pseudocylindrical, projections, include, the, healpix, projection, combines, an, equal, area, cylindrical, projection, in, equatorial, regions, with, the, collignon, projection, in, polar, areas, the, term, conic, projection, is, used, to, refer, to, any, projection, in, which, meridians, are, mapped, to, equally, spaced, lines, radiating, out, from, the, apex, and, circles, of, latitude, parallels, are, mapped, to, circular, arcs, centered, on, the, apex, when, making, a, conic, map, the, map, maker, arbitrarily, picks, two, standard, parallels, those, standard, parallels, may, be, visualized, as, secant, lines, where, the, cone, intersects, the, globe, or, if, the, map, maker, chooses, the, same, parallel, twice, as, the, tangent, line, where, the, cone, is, tangent, to, the, globe, the, resulting, conic, map, has, low, distortion, in, scale, shape, and, area, near, those, standard, parallels, distances, along, the, parallels, to, the, north, of, both, standard, parallels, or, to, the, south, of, both, standard, parallels, are, stretched, distances, along, parallels, between, the, standard, parallels, are, compressed, when, a, single, standard, parallel, is, used, distances, along, all, other, parallels, are, stretched, conic, projections, that, are, commonly, used, are, azimuthal, projections, have, the, property, that, directions, from, a, central, point, are, preserved, and, therefore, great, circles, through, the, central, point, are, represented, by, straight, lines, on, the, map, these, projections, also, have, radial, symmetry, in, the, scales, and, hence, in, the, distortions, map, distances, from, the, central, point, are, computed, by, a, function, r, d, of, the, true, distance, d, independent, of, the, angle, correspondingly, circles, with, the, central, point, as, center, are, mapped, into, circles, which, have, as, center, the, central, point, on, the, map, the, mapping, of, radial, lines, can, be, visualized, by, imagining, a, plane, tangent, to, the, earth, with, the, central, point, as, tangent, point, the, radial, scale, is, r, d, and, the, transverse, scale, r, d, r, sin, d, r, where, r, is, the, radius, of, the, earth, some, azimuthal, projections, are, true, perspective, projections, that, is, they, can, be, constructed, mechanically, projecting, the, surface, of, the, earth, by, extending, lines, from, a, point, of, perspective, along, an, infinite, line, through, the, tangent, point, and, the, tangent, point, s, antipode, onto, the, plane, other, azimuthal, projections, are, not, true, perspective, projections, polyhedral, map, projections, use, a, polyhedron, to, subdivide, the, globe, into, faces, and, then, projects, each, face, to, the, globe, the, most, well, known, polyhedral, map, projection, is, buckminster, fuller, s, dymaxion, map, conformal, or, orthomorphic, map, projections, preserve, angles, locally, implying, that, they, map, infinitesimal, circles, of, constant, size, anywhere, on, the, earth, to, infinitesimal, circles, of, varying, sizes, on, the, map, in, contrast, mappings, that, are, not, conformal, distort, most, such, small, circles, into, ellipses, of, distortion, an, important, consequence, of, conformality, is, that, relative, angles, at, each, point, of, the, map, are, correct, and, the, local, scale, although, varying, throughout, the, map, in, every, direction, around, any, one, point, is, constant, these, are, some, conformal, projections, equal, area, maps, preserve, area, measure, generally, distorting, shapes, in, order, to, do, so, equal, area, maps, are, also, called, equivalent, or, authalic, these, are, some, projections, that, preserve, area, if, the, length, of, the, line, segment, connecting, two, projected, points, on, the, plane, is, proportional, to, the, geodesic, shortest, surface, distance, between, the, two, unprojected, points, on, the, globe, then, we, say, that, distance, has, been, preserved, between, those, two, points, an, equidistant, projection, preserves, distances, from, one, or, two, special, points, to, all, other, points, the, special, point, or, points, may, get, stretched, into, a, line, or, curve, segment, when, projected, in, that, case, the, point, on, the, line, or, curve, segment, closest, to, the, point, being, measured, to, must, be, used, to, measure, the, distance, great, circles, are, displayed, as, straight, lines, direction, to, a, fixed, location, b, the, bearing, at, the, starting, location, a, of, the, shortest, route, corresponds, to, the, direction, on, the, map, from, a, to, b, compromise, projections, give, up, the, idea, of, perfectly, preserving, metric, properties, seeking, instead, to, strike, a, balance, between, distortions, or, to, simply, make, things, look, right, most, of, these, types, of, projections, distort, shape, in, the, polar, regions, more, than, at, the, equator, these, are, some, compromise, projections, the, mathematics, of, projection, do, not, permit, any, particular, map, projection, to, be, best, for, everything, something, will, always, be, distorted, thus, many, projections, exist, to, serve, the, many, uses, of, maps, and, their, vast, range, of, scales, modern, national, mapping, systems, typically, employ, a, transverse, mercator, or, close, variant, for, large, scale, maps, in, order, to, preserve, conformality, and, low, variation, in, scale, over, small, areas, for, smaller, scale, maps, such, as, those, spanning, continents, or, the, entire, world, many, projections, are, in, common, use, according, to, their, fitness, for, the, purpose, such, as, winkel, tripel, robinson, and, mollweide, reference, maps, of, the, world, often, appear, on, compromise, projections, due, to, distortions, inherent, in, any, map, of, the, world, the, choice, of, projection, becomes, largely, one, of, aesthetics, thematic, maps, normally, require, an, equal, area, projection, so, that, phenomena, per, unit, area, are, shown, in, correct, proportion, however, representing, area, ratios, correctly, necessarily, distorts, shapes, more, than, many, maps, that, are, not, equal, area, the, mercator, projection, developed, for, navigational, purposes, has, often, been, used, in, world, maps, where, other, projections, would, have, been, more, appropriate, this, problem, has, long, been, recognized, even, outside, professional, circles, for, example, a, 1943, new, york, times, editorial, states, the, time, has, come, to, discard, for, something, that, represents, the, continents, and, directions, less, deceptively, although, its, usage, has, diminished, it, is, still, highly, popular, as, a, wall, map, apparently, in, part, because, as, a, rectangular, map, it, fills, a, rectangular, wall, space, with, more, map, and, clearly, because, its, familiarity, breeds, more, popularity, 166, a, controversy, in, the, 1980s, over, the, peters, map, motivated, the, american, cartographic, association, now, the, cartography, and, geographic, information, society, to, produce, a, series, of, booklets, including, which, map, is, best, designed, to, educate, the, public, about, map, projections, and, distortion, in, maps, in, 1989, and, 1990, after, some, internal, debate, seven, north, american, geographic, organizations, adopted, a, resolution, recommending, against, using, any, rectangular, projection, including, mercator, and, gall, peters, for, reference, maps, of, the, world
