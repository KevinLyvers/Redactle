its, independence, in, 1932, basra, suffered, great, losses, during, the, iran, iraq, war, the, gulf, war, and, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, basra, is, iraq, s, main, port, although, it, does, not, have, deep, water, access, which, is, handled, at, the, port, of, umm, qasr, however, construction, of, the, grand, faw, port, on, the, southeastern, coast, of, basra, governorate, which, is, considered, a, national, project, for, iraq, is, expected, to, strengthen, iraq, s, geopolitical, position, by, giving, the, country, the, largest, port, in, the, middle, east, and, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, furthermore, iraq, is, planning, to, establish, a, large, naval, base, in, the, faw, peninsula, in, april, 2017, the, iraqi, parliament, recognized, basra, as, iraq, s, economic, capital, basra, has, emerged, as, an, important, commercial, and, industrial, center, for, the, country, as, the, city, is, home, to, a, large, number, of, manufacturing, industries, ranging, from, petrochemical, to, water, treatment, the, city, has, had, many, names, throughout, history, basrah, being, the, most, common, in, arabic, the, word, ba, rah, means, the, overwatcher, which, may, have, been, an, allusion, to, the, city, s, origin, as, an, arab, military, base, against, the, sassanids, others, have, argued, that, the, name, is, derived, from, the, aramaic, word, basratha, meaning, place, of, huts, settlement, the, city, was, founded, at, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, era, in, 636, and, began, as, a, garrison, encampment, for, arab, tribesmen, constituting, the, armies, of, the, rashidun, caliph, umar, a, tell, a, few, kilometers, south, of, the, present, city, still, marks, the, original, site, which, was, a, military, site, while, defeating, the, forces, of, the, sassanid, empire, there, the, muslim, commander, utbah, ibn, ghazwan, erected, his, camp, on, the, site, of, an, old, persian, military, settlement, called, vahe, t, b, d, arda, r, which, was, destroyed, by, the, arabs, the, name, al, basrah, which, in, arabic, means, the, over, watching, or, the, seeing, everything, was, given, to, it, because, of, its, role, as, a, military, base, against, the, sassanid, empire, however, other, sources, claim, the, name, originates, from, the, persian, word, bas, r, h, or, bassor, h, meaning, where, many, ways, come, together, in, 639, umar, established, this, encampment, as, a, city, with, five, districts, and, appointed, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, as, its, first, governor, the, city, was, built, in, a, circular, plan, according, to, the, partho, sasanian, architecture, abu, musa, led, the, conquest, of, khuzestan, from, 639, to, 642, and, was, ordered, by, umar, to, aid, uthman, ibn, abi, al, as, then, fighting, iran, from, a, new, more, easterly, mi, r, at, tawwaj, in, 650, the, rashidun, caliph, uthman, reorganised, the, persian, frontier, installed, abdullah, ibn, amir, as, basra, s, governor, and, put, the, military, s, southern, wing, under, basra, s, control, ibn, amir, led, his, forces, to, their, final, victory, over, yazdegerd, iii, the, sassanid, king, of, kings, in, 656, uthman, was, murdered, and, ali, was, appointed, caliph, ali, first, installed, uthman, ibn, hanif, as, basra, s, governor, who, was, followed, by, abdullah, ibn, abbas, these, men, held, the, city, for, ali, until, the, latter, s, death, in, 661, why, basra, was, chosen, as, a, site, for, the, new, city, remains, unclear, the, original, site, lay, 15km, from, the, shatt, al, arab, and, thus, lacked, access, to, maritime, trade, and, more, importantly, to, fresh, water, additionally, neither, historical, texts, nor, archaeological, finds, indicate, that, there, was, much, of, an, agricultural, hinterland, in, the, area, before, basra, was, founded, indeed, in, an, anecdote, related, by, al, baladhuri, al, ahnaf, ibn, qays, pleaded, to, the, caliph, umar, that, whereas, other, muslim, settlers, were, established, in, well, watered, areas, with, extensive, farmland, the, people, of, basra, had, only, reedy, salt, marsh, which, never, dries, up, and, where, pasture, never, grows, bounded, on, the, east, by, brackish, water, and, on, the, west, by, waterless, desert, we, have, no, cultivation, or, stock, farming, to, provide, us, with, our, livelihood, or, food, which, comes, to, us, as, through, the, throat, of, an, ostrich, nevertheless, basra, overcame, these, natural, disadvantages, and, rapidly, grew, into, the, second, largest, city, in, iraq, if, not, the, entire, islamic, world, its, role, as, a, military, encampment, meant, that, the, soldiers, had, to, be, fed, and, since, those, soldiers, were, receiving, government, salaries, they, had, money, to, spend, thus, both, the, government, and, private, entrepreneurs, invested, heavily, in, developing, a, vast, agricultural, infrastructure, in, the, basra, region, these, investments, were, made, with, the, expectation, of, a, profitable, return, indicating, the, value, of, the, basra, food, market, although, zanj, slaves, from, africa, were, put, to, work, on, these, construction, projects, most, of, the, labor, was, done, by, free, men, working, for, wages, governors, sometimes, directly, supervised, these, projects, but, usually, they, simply, assigned, the, land, while, most, of, the, financing, was, done, by, private, investors, the, result, of, these, investments, was, a, massive, irrigation, system, covering, some, 57, 000, hectares, between, the, shatt, al, arab, and, the, now, dry, western, channel, of, the, tigris, this, system, was, first, reported, in, 962, when, just, 8, 000, hectares, of, it, remained, in, use, for, the, cultivation, of, date, palms, while, the, rest, had, become, desert, this, system, consists, of, a, regular, pattern, of, two, meter, high, ridges, in, straight, lines, separated, by, old, canal, beds, the, ridges, are, extremely, saline, with, salt, deposits, up, to, 20, centimeters, thick, and, are, completely, barren, the, former, canal, beds, are, less, salty, and, can, support, a, small, population, of, salt, resistant, plants, contemporary, authors, recorded, how, the, zanj, slaves, were, put, to, work, clearing, the, fields, of, salty, topsoil, and, putting, them, into, piles, the, result, was, the, ridges, that, remain, today, this, represents, an, enormous, amount, of, work, h, s, nelson, calculated, that, 45, million, tons, of, earth, were, moved, in, total, and, with, his, extremely, high, estimate, of, one, man, moving, two, tons, of, soil, per, day, this, would, have, taken, a, decade, of, strenuous, work, by, 25, 000, men, ultimately, basra, s, irrigation, canals, were, unsustainable, because, they, were, built, at, too, little, of, a, slope, for, the, water, flow, to, carry, salt, deposits, away, this, required, the, clearing, of, salty, topsoil, by, the, zanj, slaves, in, order, to, keep, the, fields, from, becoming, too, saline, to, grow, crops, after, basra, was, sacked, in, by, zanj, rebels, in, the, late, 800s, and, then, by, the, qarmatians, in, the, early, 900s, there, was, no, financial, incentive, to, invest, in, restoring, the, irrigation, system, and, the, infrastructure, was, almost, completely, abandoned, finally, in, the, late, 900s, the, city, of, basra, was, entirely, relocated, with, the, old, site, being, abandoned, and, a, new, one, developing, on, the, banks, of, the, shatt, al, arab, where, it, has, remained, ever, since, the, sufyanids, held, basra, until, yazid, i, s, death, in, 683, the, sufyanids, first, governor, was, umayyad, abdullah, a, renowned, military, leader, commanding, fealty, and, financial, demands, from, karballah, but, poor,
