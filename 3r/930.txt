no, name, and, was, simply, called, the, new, place, gopi, consulted, with, astrologers, who, suggested, the, name, suraj, or, suryapur, or, city, of, the, sun, gopi, sent, a, request, to, the, unnamed, king, of, gujarat, for, this, to, be, the, new, town, s, name, but, the, name, smacked, too, much, of, hinduism, for, the, muslim, king, so, he, altered, it, to, surat, after, the, word, surah, which, is, the, name, of, the, chapters, of, the, qur, an, however, the, names, suryapur, and, surat, are, both, mentioned, in, sources, before, 1500, so, both, the, name, and, the, town,

centre, in, the, area, rander, had, a, prominent, arab, merchant, community, involved, in, overseas, trade, with, regions, such, as, burma, china, malaya, and, sumatra, in, the, 1500s, rander, declined, due, to, portuguese, raids, surat, became, an, important, port, city, around, the, same, time, and, some, of, rander, s, merchant, population, likely, moved, to, surat, for, economic, opportunity, 82, 3, early, references, to, surat, appear, by, the, 10th, century, but, they, shed, little, light, on, what, type, of, settlement, it, was, as, suryapur, it, is, mentioned, along, with, bharuch, as, a, place, where, an, army, from, anhilwara, passed, through, in, 990, en, route, to, attack, the, ruler, of, lata, suryapur, may, also, be, the, port, called, surabaya, mentioned, by,

the, identification, of, this, place, with, surat, though, is, uncertain, and, in, any, case, these, early, mentions, of, suryapur, or, surabaya, do, not, indicate, whether, it, was, a, sizeable, town, or, just, a, small, hamlet, 82, 3, another, early, mention, of, surat, is, in, the, 1190s, after, qutb, ud, din, aibak, then, a, general, of, muhammad, ghuri, defeated, the, chaulukya, king,

then, ruled, by, a, hindu, chief, based, at, nearby, kamrej, this, ruler, initially, tried, to, take, refuge, in, a, garden, at, surat, but, then, decided, that, he, had, no, chance, of, resisting, aibak, s, forces, and, offered, his, submission, aibak, in, turn, confirmed, him, as, ruler, of, kamrej, 82, 3, from, 1297, gujarat, was, gradually, conquered, by, allauddin, khilji, the, ruler, of,

following, the, fall, of, the, gujarat, sultanate, in, 1538, it, was, controlled, by, more, local, nobles, starting, with, chengiz, khan, who, enjoyed, absolute, authority, over, surat, broach, baroda, and, champaner, however, in, 1637, aurangzeb, fully, annexed, baglana, into, the, mughal, empire, in, 1514, the, portuguese, traveler, duarte, barbosa, described, surat, as, an, important,

empire, as, it, became, the, most, important, port, city, of, that, reign, and, evolved, into, a, bustling, trading, hub, it, was, the, most, prosperous, port, in, the, mughal, empire, despite, being, a, rich, city, surat, looked, like, a, typical, grubby, trader, s, town, with, mud, and, bamboo, tenements, and, crooked, streets, although, along, the, riverfront, there, were, a, few, mansions, and, warehouses, belonging, to, local, merchant, princes, and, the, establishments, of, turkish, armenian, english, french, and, dutch, traders, there, were, also, hospitals, for, cows, horses, flies, and, insects, run, by, religious, jains, which, puzzled, travelers, some, streets, were, narrow, while, others, were, of, sufficient, width, in, the, evening, especially, near, the, bazaar, marketplace, the, streets, became, crowded, with, people, and, merchants, including, banyan, merchants, selling, their, goods, surat, was, a, populous, city, during, the, mughal, era, but, also, had, a, large, transient, population, during, the, monsoon, season, when, ships, could, come, and, go, from, the, ports, without, danger, the, city, s, population, would, swell, in, 1612, england, established, its,

tapti, river, from, athwalines, to, dumas, was, specially, meant, for, shipbuilders, who, were, usually, rassis, the, city, continued, to, be, prosperous, until, the, rise, of, bombay, present, day, mumbai, afterward, surat, s, shipbuilding, industry, declined, and, surat, itself, gradually, declined, throughout, the, 18th, century, during, 1790, 1791, an, epidemic, killed, 100, 000, gujaratis, in, surat, the, british, and, dutch, both, claimed, control, of, the, city, but, in, 1800, the, british, took, control, of, surat, a, fire, in, 1837, resulted, in, more, than, 500, deaths, and, the, destruction, of, much, of, the, city, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, surat, had, become, a, stagnant, city, with, about, 80, 000, inhabitants, when, india, s, railways, opened, the, city,

under, british, raj, surat, saw, a, period, of, decline, from, its, success, under, the, mughal, empire, though, it, remained, a, pivotal, city, for, textile, based, products, it, was, less, important, to, the, british, as, a, port, city, than, it, was, for, the, mughals, nevertheless, surat, was, very, interconnected, with, asia, and, europe, involving, trade, with, both, europeans, and, armenian, merchants, tactically, surat, involved, itself, in, trade, in, fields, that, did, not, compete, with, existing, european, products, such, as, pearls, and, silver, the, textile, industry, was, also, a, large, portion, of, surat, s, shipping, success, but, despite, being, a, primary, port, for, textiles, surat, rarely, manufactured, these, textiles, locally, bullion, was, also, quite, important, to, surat, s, economy, during, this, time, during, his, first, hand, experience, on, a, trip, to, surat, britisher, john, ovington, recalls, the, great, ores, surat, possessed, such, as, gold, and, silver, he, recollects, the, notable, abundance, of, pearls, and, other, precious, stones, like, diamonds, that, could, be, purchas, d, here, at, very, reasonable, rates, as, ovington, observed, this, industry, was, imperative, to, surat, s, prosperity, under, the, british, raj, and, allowed, it, to, maintain, its, relevance, as, a, port, city, during, the, quit, india, movement, of, mahatma, gandhi, in, 1942, a, large, number, of, 3, 000, koli, cultivators, from, matwad, karadi, machhad, and, kothmadi, in, surat, district, fought, against, british, soldiers, at, matwad, with,

taluqas, became, so, aggravated, that, british, troops, was, marched, through, the, villages, between, 22, and, 24, august, 1942, the, armenian, community, in, surat, india, flourished, from, the, 16th, to, the, 17th, centuries, leaving, a, lasting, impact, on, the, city, s, history, the, armenian, gravestones, in, surat, dating, back, to, this, period, are, intricate, and, well, preserved, showcasing, the, community, s, presence, and, customs, armenians, in, surat, were, renowned, traders, dealing, in, jewelry, precious, stones, cotton, and, silk, they, established, trade, routes, to, destinations, such, as, egypt, the, levant, turkey, venice, and, leghorn, often, traveling, with, their, families, the, british, recognised, the, armenians, business, prowess, seeking, their, cooperation, for, trading, privileges, in, the, mughal, court, today, these, gravestones, serve, as, a, poignant, reminder, of, the, armenian, community, s, significant, contributions, to, surat, s, history, and, culture, after, india, gained, independence, on, 15, august, 1947, surat, became, part, of, india, at, that, time, it, was, a, part, of, bombay, state, later, it, became, the, part, of,

a, major, health, crisis, in, 1994, news, of, a, plague, outbreak, in, surat, occurred, in, september, 1994, and, when, the, possibility, of, quarantine, for, the, city, was, mentioned, many, residents, of, surat, fled, the, city, about, a, quarter, of, surat, s, population, fled, the, city, including, people, who, were, in, the, incubation, phase, of, the, disease, this, in, turn, partly, contributed, to, the, spread, of, the, plague, throughout, india, in, the, media, the, cause, of, the, plague, was, attributed, to, poor, garbage, disposal, however, the, spread, was, instead, brought, about, by, rodents, and, fleas, which, were, inadvertently, caused, by, garbage, in, surat, the, disease, ran, more, rampant, through, the, slum, population, of, surat, in, order, to, combat, the, spread, of, this, disease, surat, closed, its, schools, universities, and, public, places, for, an, indefinite, period, they, also, ordered, the, shutdown, of, important, industrial, businesses,

suspended, in, 1993, leaving, no, major, elected, body, in, charge, during, the, plague, suryadevara, ramachandra, rao, was, elected, as, the, new, administrator, and, launched, extensive, cleaning, campaigns, to, combat, the, outbreak, this, was, a, major, step, towards, sanitation, and, cleanliness, in, surat, rao, s, campaigns, included, launching, hotel, and, shop, inspections, to, address, their, irresponsible, garbage, practices, for, several, months, and, calling, for, the, broadening, of, roads, he, enforced, designated, sweeping, of, the, city, as, well, as, the, regular, collection, of, garbage, rao, also, demolished, many, illegal, constructions, however, slums, would, often, fall, subject, to, removal, when, streets, were, widened, but, rao, ensured, that, the, residents, were, given, alternative, residential, sites, with, adequate, facilities, to, accommodate, them, rao, s, urban, and, sanitary, related, actions, fostered, the, revival, of, surat, in, its, post, plague, state, nevertheless, the, plague, had, long, lasting, implications, for, surat, it, brought, attention, to, the, lack, of, information, and, the, spread, of, misinformation, that, occurred, in, india, incorrect, death, tolls, and, false, facts, about, the, cause, of, the, disease, were, spread, leaving, lots, of, room, for, post, plague, city, revival, both, in, terms, of, information, control, and, cleanliness, surat, s, actions, pertaining, to, the, latter, eventually, resulted, in, the, indian, national, trust, for, art, and, cultural, heritage, deeming, surat, as,
