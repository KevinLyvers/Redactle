enormous, and, diverse, ethnolinguistic, group, that, comprise, the, majority, of, people, in, much, of, eastern, southern, and, central, africa, due, to, zambia, s, location, at, the, crossroads, of, central, africa, southern, africa, and, the, african, great, lakes, the, history, of, the, people, that, constitute, modern, zambians, is, a, history, of, these, three, regions, many, of, the, historical, events, in, these, three, regions, happened, simultaneously, thus, zambia, s, history, like, that, of, many, african, nations, cannot, be, presented, perfectly, chronologically, the, early, history, of, the, peoples, of, modern, zambia, is, deduced, from, oral, records, archaeology, and, written, records, mostly, from, non, africans, the, bantu, people, originally, lived, in, west, and, central, africa, around, what, is, today, cameroon, and, nigeria, approximately, 5000, years, ago, they, began, a, millennia, long, expansion, into, much, of, the, continent, this, event, has, been, called, the, bantu, expansion, it, was, one, of, the, largest, human, migrations, in, history, the, bantu, are, believed, to, have, been, the, first, to, have, brought, iron, working, technology, into, large, parts, of, africa, the, bantu, expansion, happened, primarily, through, two, routes, a, western, one, via, the, congo, basin, and, an, eastern, one, via, the, african, great, lakes, the, first, bantu, people, to, arrive, in, zambia, came, through, the, eastern, route, via, the, african, great, lakes, they, arrived, around, the, first, millennium, c, e, and, among, them, were, the, tonga, people, also, called, ba, tonga, ba, meaning, men, and, the, ba, ila, and, namwanga, and, other, related, groups, who, settled, around, southern, zambia, near, zimbabwe, ba, tonga, oral, records, indicate, that, they, came, from, the, east, near, the, big, sea, they, were, later, joined, by, the, ba, tumbuka, who, settled, around, eastern, zambia, and, malawi, these, first, bantu, people, lived, in, large, villages, they, lacked, an, organised, unit, under, a, chief, or, headman, and, worked, as, a, community, and, helped, each, other, in, times, of, field, preparation, for, their, crops, villages, moved, around, frequently, as, the, soil, became, exhausted, as, a, result, of, the, slash, and, burn, technique, of, planting, crops, the, people, also, kept, large, herds, of, cattle, which, formed, an, important, part, of, their, societies, the, first, bantu, communities, in, zambia, were, highly, self, sufficient, early, european, missionaries, who, settled, in, southern, zambia, noted, the, independence, of, these, bantu, societies, one, of, these, missionaries, noted, weapons, for, war, hunting, and, domestic, purposes, are, needed, the, man, goes, to, the, hills, and, digs, until, he, finds, the, iron, ore, he, smelts, it, and, with, the, iron, thus, obtained, makes, axes, hoes, and, other, useful, implements, he, burns, wood, and, makes, charcoal, for, his, forge, his, bellows, are, made, from, the, skins, of, animals, and, the, pipes, are, clay, tile, and, the, anvil, and, hammers, are, also, pieces, of, the, iron, he, has, obtained, he, moulds, welds, shapes, and, performs, all, the, work, of, the, ordinary, blacksmith, these, early, bantu, settlers, also, participated, in, the, trade, at, the, site, ingombe, ilede, which, translates, to, sleeping, cow, in, chi, tonga, because, the, fallen, baobab, tree, appears, to, resemble, a, cow, in, southern, zambia, at, this, trading, site, they, met, numerous, kalanga, shona, traders, from, great, zimbabwe, and, swahili, traders, from, the, east, african, swahili, coast, ingombe, ilede, was, one, of, the, most, important, trading, posts, for, rulers, of, great, zimbabwe, others, being, the, swahili, port, cities, like, sofala, the, goods, traded, at, ingombe, ilede, included, fabrics, beads, gold, and, bangles, some, of, these, items, came, from, what, is, today, southern, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, kilwa, kisiwani, while, others, came, from, as, far, away, as, india, china, and, the, arab, world, the, african, traders, were, later, joined, by, the, portuguese, in, the, 16th, century, the, decline, of, great, zimbabwe, due, to, increasing, trade, competition, from, other, kalanga, shona, kingdoms, like, khami, and, mutapa, spelt, the, end, of, ingombe, ilede, the, second, mass, settlement, of, bantu, people, into, zambia, was, of, people, groups, that, are, believed, to, have, taken, the, western, route, of, the, bantu, migration, through, the, congo, basin, these, bantu, people, spent, the, majority, of, their, existence, in, what, is, today, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, are, ancestors, of, the, majority, of, modern, zambians, while, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, bemba, people, or, ababemba, have, a, strong, ancient, connection, to, the, kongo, kingdom, through, bakongo, ruler, mwene, kongo, viii, mvemba, this, is, not, well, documented, the, bemba, along, with, other, related, groups, like, the, lamba, bisa, senga, kaonde, swaka, nkoya, and, soli, formed, integral, parts, of, the, luba, kingdom, in, upemba, part, of, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, have, a, strong, relation, to, the, baluba, people, the, area, which, the, luba, kingdom, occupied, has, been, inhabited, by, early, farmers, and, iron, workers, since, the, 300s, c, e, over, time, these, communities, learned, to, use, nets, and, harpoons, make, dugout, canoes, clear, canals, through, swamps, and, make, dams, as, high, as, 2, 5, meters, 8, ft, 2, in, as, a, result, they, grew, a, diverse, economy, trading, fish, copper, and, iron, items, and, salt, for, goods, from, other, parts, of, africa, like, the, swahili, coast, and, later, on, the, portuguese, from, these, communities, arose, the, luba, kingdom, in, the, 14th, century, the, luba, kingdom, was, a, large, kingdom, with, a, centralised, government, and, smaller, independent, chiefdoms, it, had, large, trading, networks, that, linked, the, forests, in, the, congo, basin, and, the, mineral, rich, plateaus, of, what, is, today, copperbelt, province, and, stretched, from, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, indian, ocean, coast, the, arts, were, also, held, in, high, esteem, in, the, kingdom, and, artisans, were, held, in, high, regard, literature, was, well, developed, in, the, luba, kingdom, one, renowned, luba, genesis, story, that, articulated, the, distinction, between, two, types, of, luba, emperors, goes, as, follows, nkongolo, mwamba, the, red, king, and, ilunga, mbidi, kiluwe, a, prince, of, legendary, black, complexion, nkongolo, mwamba, is, the, drunken, and, cruel, despot, ilunga, mbidi, kiluwe, the, refined, and, gentle, prince, nkongolo, the, red, is, a, man, without, manners, a, man, who, eats, in, public, gets, drunk, and, cannot, control, himself, whereas, mbidi, kiluwe, is, a, man, of, reservation, obsessed, with, good, manners, he, does, not, eat, in, public, controls, his, language, and, his, behaviour, and, keeps, a, distance, from, the, vices, and, modus, vivendi, of, ordinary, people, nkongolo, mwamba, symbolizes, the, embodiment, of, tyranny, whereas, mbidi, kiluwe, remains, the, admired, caring, and, compassionate, kin, in, the, same, region, of, southern, congo, the, lunda, people, were, made, into, a, satellite, of, the, luba, empire, and, adopted, forms, of, luba, culture, and, governance, thus, becoming, the, lunda, empire, to, the, south, according, to, lunda, genesis, myths, a, luba, hunter, named, chibinda, ilunga, son, of, ilunga, mbidi, kiluwe, introduced, the, luba, model, of, statecraft, to, the, lunda, sometime, around, 1600, when, he, married, a, local, lunda, princess, named, lueji, and, was, granted, control, of, her, kingdom, most, rulers, who, claimed, descent, from, luba, ancestors, were, integrated, into, the, luba, empire, the, lunda, kings, however, remained, separate, and, actively, expanded, their, political, and, economic, dominance, over, the, region, the, lunda, like, its, parent, state, luba, also, traded, with, both, coasts, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, while, ruler, mwaant, yaav, naweej, had, established, trade, routes, to, the, atlantic, coast, and, initiated, direct, contact, with, european, traders, eager, for, slaves, and, forest, products, and, controlling, the, regional, copper, trade, and, settlements, around, lake, mweru, regulated, commerce, with, the, east, african, coast, the, luba, lunda, states, eventually, declined, as, a, result, of, both, atlantic, slave, trade, in, the, west, and, indian, ocean, slave, trade, in, the, east, and, wars, with, breakaway, factions, of, the, kingdoms, the, chokwe, a, group, that, is, closely, related, to, the, luvale, and, formed, a, lunda, satellite, state, initially, suffered, from, the, european, demand, for, slaves, but, once, they, broke, away, from, the, lunda, state, they, themselves, became, notorious, slave, traders, exporting, slaves, to, both, coasts, the, chokwe, eventually, were, defeated, by, the, other, ethnic, groups, and, the, portuguese, this, instability, caused, the, collapse, of, the, luba, lunda, states, and, a, dispersal, of, people, into, various, parts, of, zambia, from, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, majority, of, zambians, trace, their, ancestry, to, the, luba, lunda, and, surrounding, central, african, states, in, the, 1200s, before, the, founding, of, the, luba, lunda, states, a, group, of, bantu, people, started, migrating, from, the, congo, basin, to, lake, mweru, then, finally, settled, around, lake, malawi, these, migrants, are, believed, to, have, been, one, of, the, inhabitants, around, the, upemba, area, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, by, the, 1400s, these, groups, of, migrants, collectively, called, the, maravi, and, most, prominently, among, them, was, the, chewa, people, achewa, who, started, assimilating, other, bantu, groups, like, the, tumbuka, in, 1480, the, maravi, empire, was, founded, by, the, kalonga, paramount, chief, of, the, maravi, from, the, phiri, clan, one, of, the, main, clans, with, the, others, being, banda, mwale, and, nkhoma, the, maravi, empire, stretched, from, the, indian, ocean, through, what, today, is, mozambique, to, zambia, and, large, parts, of, malawi, the, political, organization, of, the, maravi, resembled, that, of, the, luba, and, is, believed, to, have, originated, from, there, the, primary, export, of, the, maravi, was, ivory, which, was, transported, to, swahili, brokers, iron, was, also, manufactured, and, exported, in, the, 1590s, the, portuguese, endeavoured, to, take, monopoly, over, maravi, export, trade, this, attempt, was, met, with, outrage, by, the, maravi, of, lundu, who, unleashed, their, wazimba, armed, force, the, wazimba, sacked, the, portuguese, trade, towns, of, tete, sena, and, various, other, towns, the, maravi, are, also, believed, to, have, brought, the, traditions, that, would, become, nyau, secret, society, from, upemba, the, nyau, form, the, cosmology, or, indigenous, religion, of, the, people, of, maravi, the, nyau, society, consists, of, ritual, dance, performances, and, masks, used, for, the, dances, this, belief, system, spread, around, the, region, the, maravi, declined, as, a, result, of, succession, disputes, within, the, confederacy, attack, by, the, ngoni, and, slave, raids, from, the, yao, as, great, zimbabwe, was, in, decline, one, of, its, princes, nyatsimba, mutota, broke, away, from, the, state, forming, a, new, empire, called, mutapa, the, title, of, mwene, mutapa, meaning, ravager, of, the, lands, was, bestowed, on, him, and, subsequent, rulers, the, mutapa, empire, ruled, territory, between, the, zambezi, and, limpopo, rivers, in, what, is, now, zambia, zimbabwe, and, mozambique, from, the, 14th, to, the, 17th, century, by, its, peak, mutapa, had, conquered, the, dande, area, of, the, tonga, and, tavara, the, mutapa, empire, predominately, engaged, in, the, indian, ocean, transcontinental, trade, with, and, via, the, waswahili, the, primary, exported, gold, and, ivory, for, silk, and, ceramics, from, asia, like, their, contemporaries, in, maravi, mutapa, had, problems, with, the, arriving, portuguese, traders, the, peak, of, this, uneasy, relationship, was, reached, when, the, portuguese, attempted, to, influence, the, kingdoms, internal, affairs, by, establishing, markets, in, the, kingdom, and, converting, the, population, to, christianity, this, action, caused, outrage, by, the, muslim, waswahili, living, in, the, capital, this, chaos, gave, the, portuguese, the, excuse, they, were, searching, for, to, warrant, an, attack, on, the, kingdom, and, try, to, control, its, gold, mines, and, ivory, routes, this, attack, failed, when, the, portuguese, succumbed, to, disease, along, the, zambezi, river, in, the, 1600s, internal, disputes, and, civil, war, began, the, decline, of, mutapa, the, weakened, kingdom, was, finally, conquered, by, the, portuguese, and, was, eventually, taken, over, by, rival, shona, states, the, portuguese, also, had, vast, estates, known, as, prazos, and, they, used, slaves, and, ex, slaves, as, security, guards, and, hunters, they, trained, the, men, in, military, tactics, and, gave, them, guns, these, men, became, expert, elephant, hunters, and, were, known, as, the, chikunda, after, the, decline, of, the, portuguese, the, chikunda, made, their, way, to, zambia, it, is, hypothesised, by, julian, cobbing, that, the, presence, of, early, europeans, slave, trading, and, attempts, to, control, resources, in, various, parts, of, bantu, speaking, africa, caused, the, gradual, militarization, of, the, people, in, the, region, this, can, be, observed, with, the, maravi, s, wazimba, warrior, caste, who, once, defeating, the, portuguese, remained, quite, militaristic, afterwards, the, portuguese, presence, in, the, region, was, also, a, major, reason, for, the, founding, of, the, rozvi, empire, a, breakaway, state, of, mutapa, the, ruler, of, the, rozvi, changamire, dombo, became, one, of, the, most, powerful, leaders, in, south, central, africa, s, history, under, his, leadership, the, rozvi, defeated, the, portuguese, and, expelled, them, from, their, trading, posts, along, the, zambezi, river, but, perhaps, the, most, notable, instance, of, this, increased, militarization, was, the, rise, of, the, zulu, under, the, leadership, of, shaka, pressures, from, the, english, colonialists, in, the, cape, and, increased, militarization, of, the, zulu, resulted, in, the, mfecane, the, crushing, the, zulu, expanded, by, assimilating, the, women, and, children, of, tribes, they, defeated, if, the, men, of, these, nguni, tribes, escaped, slaughter, they, used, the, military, tactics, of, the, zulu, to, attack, other, groups, this, caused, mass, displacements, wars, and, raids, throughout, southern, central, and, eastern, africa, as, nguni, or, ngoni, tribes, made, their, way, throughout, the, region, and, is, referred, to, as, the, mfecane, the, arriving, nguni, under, the, leadership, of, zwagendaba, crossed, the, zambezi, river, moving, northwards, the, ngoni, were, the, final, blow, to, the, already, weakened, maravi, empire, many, nguni, eventually, settled, around, what, is, today, zambia, malawi, mozambique, and, tanzania, and, assimilated, into, neighbouring, tribes, in, the, western, part, of, zambia, another, southern, african, group, of, sotho, tswana, heritage, called, the, kololo, manage, to, conquer, the, local, inhabitants, who, were, migrants, from, the, fallen, luba, and, lunda, states, called, the, luyana, or, aluyi, the, luyana, established, the, barotse, kingdom, on, the, floodplains, of, the, zambezi, upon, their, arrival, from, katanga, under, the, kololo, the, kololo, language, was, imposed, upon, the, luyana, until, the, luyana, revolted, and, overthrew, the, kololo, by, this, time, the, luyana, language, was, largely, forgotten, and, a, new, hybrid, language, emerged, silozi, and, the, luyana, began, to, refer, to, themselves, as, lozi, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, some, of, the, mbunda, migrated, to, barotseland, mongu, upon, the, migration, of, among, others, the, ciyengele, the, aluyi, and, their, leader, the, litunga, mulambwa, especially, valued, the, mbunda, for, their, fighting, ability, by, the, late, 18th, century, most, of, the, various, peoples, of, zambia, were, established, in, their, current, areas, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, europeans, to, visit, the, area, was, the, portuguese, explorer, francisco, de, lacerda, in, the, late, 18th, century, lacerda, led, an, expedition, from, mozambique, to, the, kazembe, region, in, zambia, with, the, goal, of, exploring, and, to, crossing, southern, africa, from, coast, to, coast, for, the, first, time, and, died, during, the, expedition, in, 1798, the, expedition, was, from, then, on, led, by, his, friend, francisco, pinto, this, territory, located, between, portuguese, mozambique, and, portuguese, angola, was, claimed, and, explored, by, portugal, in, that, period, other, european, visitors, followed, in, the, 19th, century, the, most, prominent, of, these, was, david, livingstone, who, had, a, vision, of, ending, the, slave, trade, through, the, 3, cs, christianity, commerce, and, civilisation, he, was, the, first, european, to, see, the, magnificent, waterfalls, on, the, zambezi, river, in, 1855, naming, them, the, victoria, falls, after, queen, victoria, of, the, united, kingdom, he, described, them, thus, scenes, so, lovely, must, have, been, gazed, upon, by, angels, in, their, flight, locally, the, falls, are, known, as, mosi, o, tunya, or, thundering, smoke, in, the, lozi, or, kololo, dialect, the, town, of, livingstone, near, the, falls, is, named, after, him, highly, publicised, accounts, of, his, journeys, motivated, a, wave, of, european, visitors, missionaries, and, traders, after, his, death, in, 1873, british, south, africa, company, in, 1888, the, british, south, africa, company, bsa, company, led, by, cecil, rhodes, obtained, mineral, rights, from, the, litunga, of, the, lozi, people, the, paramount, chief, of, the, lozi, ba, rotse, for, the, area, which, later, became, barotziland, north, western, rhodesia, to, the, east, in, december, 1897, a, group, of, the, angoni, or, ngoni, originally, from, zululand, rebelled, under, tsinco, son, of, king, mpezeni, but, the, rebellion, was, put, down, and, mpezeni, accepted, the, pax, britannica, that, part, of, the, country, then, came, to, be, known, as, north, eastern, rhodesia, in, 1895, rhodes, asked, his, american, scout, frederick, russell, burnham, to, look, for, minerals, and, ways, to, improve, river, navigation, in, the, region, and, it, was, during, this, trek, that, burnham, discovered, major, copper, deposits, along, the, kafue, river, north, eastern, rhodesia, and, barotziland, north, western, rhodesia, were, administered, as, separate, units, until, 1911, when, they, were, merged, to, form, northern, rhodesia, a, british, protectorate, in, 1923, the, bsa, company, ceded, control, of, northern, rhodesia, to, the, british, government, after, the, government, decided, not, to, renew, the, company, s, charter, in, 1923, southern, rhodesia, now, zimbabwe, a, conquered, territory, which, was, also, administered, by, the, bsa, company, became, a, self, governing, british, colony, in, 1924, after, negotiations, the, administration, of, northern, rhodesia, transferred, to, the, british, colonial, office, in, 1953, the, creation, of, the, federation, of, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, grouped, together, northern, rhodesia, southern, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, now, malawi, as, a, single, semi, autonomous, region, this, was, undertaken, despite, opposition, from, a, sizeable, minority, of, the, population, who, demonstrated, against, it, in, 1960, 61, northern, rhodesia, was, the, center, of, much, of, the, turmoil, and, crisis, characterizing, the, federation, in, its, last, years, initially, harry, nkumbula, s, african, national, congress, anc, led, the, campaign, which, kenneth, kaunda, s, united, national, independence,
