capital, was, located, at, yeha, in, what, is, now, northern, ethiopia, most, modern, historians, consider, this, civilization, to, be, a, native, ethiopian, one, although, in, earlier, times, many, suggested, it, was, sabaean, influenced, because, of, the, latter, s, hegemony, of, the, red, sea, other, scholars, regard, d, mt, as, the, result, of, a, union, of, afroasiatic, speaking, cultures, of, the, cushitic, and, semitic, branches, namely, local, agaw, peoples, and, sabaeans, from, southern, arabia, however, ge, ez, the, ancient, semitic, language, of, ethiopia, is, thought, to, have, developed, independently, from, the, sabaean, language, as, early, as, 2000, bc, other, semitic, speakers, were, living, in, ethiopia, and, eritrea, where, ge, ez, developed, sabaean, influence, is, now, thought, to, have, been, minor, limited, to, a, few, localities, and, disappearing, after, a, few, decades, or, a, century, it, may, have, been, a, trading, or, military, colony, in, alliance, with, the, ethiopian, civilization, of, d, mt, or, some, other, proto, axumite, state, after, the, fall, of, d, mt, during, the, 4th, century, bc, the, ethiopian, plateau, came, to, be, dominated, by, smaller, successor, kingdoms, in, the, 1st, century, ad, the, kingdom, of, aksum, emerged, in, what, is, now, tigray, region, and, eritrea, according, to, the, medieval, book, of, axum, the, kingdom, s, first, capital, mazaber, was, built, by, itiyopis, son, of, cush, aksum, would, later, at, times, extend, its, rule, into, yemen, on, the, other, side, of, the, red, sea, the, persian, prophet, mani, listed, axum, with, rome, persia, and, china, as, one, of, the, four, great, powers, of, his, era, during, the, 3rd, century, it, is, also, believed, that, there, was, a, connection, between, egyptian, and, ethiopian, churches, there, is, diminutive, evidence, that, the, aksumites, were, associated, with, the, queen, of, sheba, via, their, royal, inscription, around, 316, ad, frumentius, and, his, brother, edesius, from, tyre, accompanied, their, uncle, on, a, voyage, to, ethiopia, when, the, vessel, stopped, at, a, red, sea, port, the, natives, killed, all, the, travellers, except, the, two, brothers, who, were, taken, to, the, court, as, slaves, they, were, given, positions, of, trust, by, the, monarch, and, they, converted, members, of, the, royal, court, to, christianity, frumentius, became, the, first, bishop, of, aksum, a, coin, dated, to, 324, shows, that, ethiopia, was, the, second, country, to, officially, adopt, christianity, after, armenia, did, so, in, 301, although, the, religion, may, have, been, at, first, confined, to, court, circles, it, was, the, first, major, power, to, do, so, the, aksumites, were, accustomed, to, the, greco, roman, sphere, of, influence, but, embarked, on, significant, cultural, ties, and, trade, connections, between, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, roman, empire, via, the, silk, road, primarily, exporting, ivory, tortoise, shell, gold, and, emeralds, and, importing, silk, and, spices, the, kingdom, adopted, the, name, ethiopia, during, the, reign, of, ezana, in, the, 4th, century, after, the, conquest, of, kingdom, of, kush, in, 330, the, aksumite, territory, reached, its, peak, between, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, this, period, was, interrupted, by, several, incursions, into, the, south, arabian, protectorate, including, jewish, dhu, nuwas, of, the, himyarite, kingdom, and, the, aksumite, persian, wars, in, 575, the, aksumites, besieged, and, retook, sana, a, following, the, assassination, of, its, governor, sayf, ibn, dh, yazan, the, red, sea, was, left, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, in, 646, and, the, port, city, of, adulis, was, plundered, by, arab, muslims, in, the, 8th, century, along, with, irrevocable, land, degradation, claimed, climate, change, and, sporadic, rainfall, precipitation, from, 730, to, 760, these, factors, likely, caused, the, kingdom, to, decline, in, power, as, part, of, an, important, trade, route, aksum, came, to, an, end, in, 960, when, queen, gudit, defeated, the, last, king, of, aksum, in, response, the, remnant, of, the, aksumite, population, to,

launched, campaigns, against, his, muslim, adversaries, to, the, east, resulting, in, a, significant, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, in, favor, of, the, christians, for, the, next, two, centuries, after, amda, seyon, s, successful, eastern, campaigns, most, of, the, muslim, principalities, in, the, horn, of, africa, came, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, ethiopian, empire,

migration, and, urbanization, are, all, straining, both, governments, and, ecosystems, capacity, to, provide, people, with, basic, services, urbanization, has, steadily, been, increasing, in, ethiopia, with, two, periods, of, significantly, rapid, growth, first, in, 1936, 1941, during, the, italian, occupation, under, mussolini, s, fascist, government, and, then, from, 1967, to, 1975, when, the, populations, of, urban, areas, tripled, in, 1936, italy, annexed, ethiopia, building, infrastructure, to, connect, major, cities, and, a, dam, providing, power, and, water, this, along, with, the, influx, of, italians, and, labourers, was, the, major, cause, of, rapid, growth, during, this, period, the, second, period, of, growth, was, from, 1967, to, 1975, when, rural, populations, migrated, to, towns, seeking, work, and, better, living, conditions, this, pattern, slowed, due, to, the, 1975, land, reform, program, instituted, by, the, government, which, provided, incentives, for, people, to, stay, in, rural, areas, as, people, moved, from, rural, areas, to, the, cities, there, were, fewer, people, to, grow, food, for, the, population, the, land, reform, act, was, meant, to, increase, agriculture, since, food, production, was, not, keeping, up, with, population, growth, over, the, period, of, 1970, 1983, this, program, encouraged, the, formation, of, peasant, associations, large, villages, based, on, agriculture, the, legislation, did, lead, to, an, increase, in, food, production, although, there, is, debate, over, the, cause, it, may, be, related, to, weather, conditions, more, than, the, reform, urban, populations, have, continued, to, grow, with, an, 8, 1, increase, from, 1975, to, 2000, as, of, at, least, 2024, ethiopia, is, one, of, the, most, rapidly, urbanizing, countries, in, the, world, although, its, population, is, still, largely, rural, migration, to, urban, areas, is, usually, motivated, by, the, hope, of, better, lives, in, peasant, associations, daily, life, is, a, struggle, to, survive, about, 16, of, the, population, in, ethiopia, lives, on, less, than, one, dollar, per, day, 2008, only, 65, of, rural, households, in,

face, a, cycle, of, poverty, since, the, landholdings, are, so, small, farmers, cannot, allow, the, land, to, lie, fallow, which, reduces, soil, fertility, this, land, degradation, reduces, the, production, of, fodder, for, livestock, which, causes, low, milk, yields, since, the, community, burns, livestock, manure, as, fuel, rather, than, plowing, the, nutrients, back, into, the, land, the, crop, production, is, reduced, the, low, productivity, of, agriculture, leads, to, inadequate, incomes, for, farmers, hunger, malnutrition, and, disease, these, unhealthy, farmers, have, difficulty, working, the, land, and, the, productivity, drops, further, although, conditions, are, drastically, better, in, cities, all, of, ethiopia, suffers, from, poverty, and, poor, sanitation, however, poverty, in, ethiopia, fell, from, 44, to, 29, 6, during, 2000, 2011, according, to, the, world, bank, in, the, capital, city, of, addis, ababa, 55, of, the, population, used, to, live, in, slums, now, however, a, construction, boom, in, both, the, private, and, the, public, sector, has, led, to, a, dramatic, improvement, in, living, standards, in, major, cities, particularly, in, addis, ababa, notably, government, built, condominium, housing, complexes, have, sprung, up, throughout, the, city, benefiting, close, to, 600, 000, individuals, sanitation, is, the, most, pressing, need, in, the, city, with, most, of, the, population, lacking, access, to, waste, treatment, facilities, this, contributes, to, the, spread, of, illness, through, unhealthy, water, despite, the, living, conditions, in, the, cities, the, people, of, addis, ababa, are, much, better, off, than, people, living, in, the, peasant, associations, owing, to, their, educational, opportunities, unlike, rural, children, 69, of, urban, children, are, enrolled, in, primary, school, and, 35, of, those, are, eligible, to, attend, secondary, school, addis, ababa, has, its, own, university, as, well, as, many, other, secondary, schools, the, literacy, rate, is, 82, many, ngos, non, governmental, organizations, are, working, to, solve, this, problem, however, most, are, far, apart, uncoordinated, and, working, in,
