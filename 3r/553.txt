foundations, believed, to, be, associated, with, the, illyrian, tribe, of, the, albani, this, connection, gains, further, support, from, the, work, of, the, ancient, greek, geographer, ptolemy, during, the, 2nd, century, ad, where, he, included, the, settlement, of, albanopolis, situated, to, the, northeast, of, durr, s, the, presence, of, a, medieval, settlement, named, albanon, or, arbanon, hints, at, the, possibility, of, historical, continuity, the, precise, relationship, among, these, historical, references, and, the, question, of, whether, albanopolis, was, synonymous, with, albanon, remain, subjects, of, scholarly, debate, the, byzantine, historian, michael, attaliates, in, his, 11th, century, historical, account, provides, the, earliest, undisputed, reference, to, the, albanians, when, he, mentions, them, having, taken, part, in, a, revolt, against, constantinople, in, 1079, he, also, identifies, the, arbanitai, as, subjects, of, the, duke, of, dyrrachium, in, the,

ria, for, their, nation, designations, that, trace, their, historical, origins, to, the, 14th, century, but, only, in, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, did, these, terms, gradually, supersede, arb, ria, and, arb, resh, among, albanians, these, two, expressions, are, widely, interpreted, to, symbolise, children, of, the, eagles, and, land, of, the, eagles, mesolithic, habitation, in, albania, has, been, evidenced, in, several, open, air, sites, which, during, that, period, were, close, to, the, adriatic, coastline, and, in, cave, sites, mesolithic, objects, found, in, a, cave, near, xarr, include, flint, and, jasper, objects, along, with, fossilised, animal, bones, while, those, discoveries, at, mount, dajt, comprise, bone, and, stone, tools, similar, to, those, of, the,

a, part, of, the, neolithic, population, may, have, been, the, same, as, the, mesolithic, population, of, the, southern, balkans, like, in, the, konispol, cave, where, the, mesolithic, stratum, co,

towards, eastern, albania, from, the, early, 5th, millennium, bc, first, evidence, of, its, overseas, trade, export, comes, from, neolithic, and, bronze, age, southern, italy, the, high, quality, bitumen, of, selenic, has, been, exploited, throughout, all, the, historical, ages, since, the, late, neolithic, era, until, today, the, indo, europeanization, of, albania, in, the, context, of, the,

and, keputa, central, albania, and, lake, basin, sites, like, sovjan, southeastern, albania, the, incorporated, territory, of, albania, was, historically, inhabited, by, indo, european, peoples, amongst, them, numerous, illyrian, and, epirote, tribes, there, were, also, several, greek, colonies, the, territory, referred, to, as, illyria, corresponded, roughly, to, the, area, east, of, the, adriatic, sea, in, the, mediterranean, sea, extending, in, the, south, to, the, mouth, of, the, vjos, the, first, account, of, the, illyrian, groups, comes, from, periplus, of, the, euxine, sea, a, greek, text, written, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, bryges, were, also, present, in, central, albania, while, the, south, was, inhabited, by, the, epirote, chaonians, whose, capital, was, at,

plundering, roman, ships, the, war, ended, in, illyrian, defeat, in, 227, bc, teuta, was, eventually, succeeded, by, gentius, in, 181, bc, gentius, clashed, with, the, romans, in, 168, bc, initiating, the, third, illyrian, war, the, conflict, resulted, in, roman, conquest, of, the, region, by, 167, bc, the, romans, split, the, region, into, three, administrative, divisions, the, roman, empire, was, split, in, 395, upon, the, death, of, theodosius, i, into, an, eastern, and, western, roman, empire, in, part, because, of, the, increasing, pressure, from, threats, during, the, barbarian, invasions, from, the, 6th, century, into, the, 7th, century, the, slavs, crossed, the, danube, and, largely, absorbed, the, indigenous, greeks, illyrians, and, thracians, in, the, balkans, thus, the, illyrians, were, mentioned, for, the, last, time, in, historical, records, in, the, 7th, century, in, the, 11th, century, the, great, schism, formalised, the, break, of, communion, between, the, eastern, orthodox, and, western, catholic, church, that, is, reflected, in, albania, through, the, emergence, of, a, catholic, north, and, orthodox, south, the, albanian, people, inhabited, the, west, of, lake, ochrida, and, the, upper, valley, of, river, shkumbin, and, established, the, principality, of, arbanon, in, 1190, under, the, leadership, of, progon, of, kruja, the, realm, was, succeeded, by,

the, 13th, century, the, principality, was, dissolved, arbanon, is, considered, to, be, the, first, sketch, of, an, albanian, state, that, retained, a, semi, autonomous, status, as, the, western, extremity, of, the, byzantine, empire, under, the, byzantine, doukai, of, epirus, or, laskarids, of, nicaea, towards, the, end, of, the, 12th, and, beginning, of, the, 13th, centuries, serbs, and, venetians, started, to, take, possession, over, the, territory, the, ethnogenesis, of, the, albanians, is, uncertain, however, the, first, undisputed, mention, of, albanians, dates, back, in, historical, records, from, 1079, or, 1080, in, a, work, by, michael, attaliates, who, referred, to, the, albanoi, as, having, taken, part, in, a, revolt, against, constantinople, at, this, point, the, albanians, were, fully, christianised, after, the, dissolution, of, arbanon, charles, of, anjou, concluded, an, agreement, with, the, albanian, rulers, promising, to, protect, them, and, their, ancient, liberties, in, 1272, he, established, the, kingdom, of, albania, and, conquered, regions, back, from, the, despotate, of, epirus, the, kingdom, claimed, all, of, central, albania, territory, from, dyrrhachium, along, the, adriatic, sea, coast, down, to, butrint, a, catholic, political, structure, was, a, basis, for, the, papal, plans, of, spreading, catholicism, in, the, balkan, peninsula, this, plan, found, also, the, support, of, helen, of, anjou, a, cousin, of, charles, of, anjou, around, 30, catholic, churches, and, monasteries, were, built, during, her, rule, mainly, in, northern, albania, internal, power, struggles, within, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, 14th, century, enabled, serbs, most, powerful, medieval, ruler, stefan, dusan, to, establish, a, short, lived, empire, that, included, all, of, albania, except, durr, s, in, 1367, various, albanian, rulers, established, the, despotate, of, arta, during, that, time, several, albanian, principalities, were, created, notably, the, principality, of, albania, principality, of, kastrioti, lordship, of, berat, and, principality, of, dukagjini, in, the, first, half, of, the, 15th, century, the, ottoman, empire, invaded, most, of, albania, and, the, league, of, lezh, was, held, under, skanderbeg, as, a, ruler, who, became, the, national, hero, of, the, albanian, medieval, history, with, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, ottoman, empire, continued, an, extended, period, of, conquest, and, expansion, with, its, borders, going, deep, into, southeast, europe, they, reached, the, albanian, ionian, sea, coast, in, 1385, and, erected, their, garrisons, across, southern, albania, in, 1415, and, then, occupied, most, of, albania, in, 1431, thousands, of, albanians, consequently, fled, to, western, europe, particularly, to, calabria, naples, ragusa, and, sicily, whereby, others, sought, protection, at, the, often, inaccessible, mountains, of, albania, the, albanians, as, christians, were, considered, an, inferior, class, of, people, and, as, such, they, were, subjected, to, heavy, taxes, among, others, by, the, devshirme, system, that, allowed, the, sultan, to, collect, a, requisite, percentage, of, christian, adolescents, from, their, families, to, compose, the, janissary, the, ottoman, conquest, was, also, accompanied, with, the, gradual, process, of, islamisation, and, the, rapid, construction, of, mosques, a, prosperous, and, longstanding, revolution, erupted, after, the, formation, of, the, league, of, lezh, until, the, fall, of, shkod, r, under, the, leadership, of, gjergj, kastrioti, skanderbeg, who, consistently, defeated, major, ottoman, armies, led, by, sultans, murad, ii, and, mehmed, ii, skanderbeg, managed, to, unite, several, of, the, albanian, principalities, amongst, them, the, arianitis, dukagjinis, zaharias, and, thopias, and, establish, a, centralised, authority, over, most, of, the, non, conquered, territories, becoming, the, lord, of, albania, the, ottoman, empire, s, expansion, ground, to, a, halt, during, the, time, that, skanderbeg, s, forces, resisted, and, he, has, been, credited, with, being, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, delay, of, ottoman, expansion, into, western, europe, giving, the, italian, principalities, more, time, to, better, prepare, for, the, ottoman, arrival, however, the, failure, of, most, european, nations, with, the, exception, of, naples, in, giving, him, support, along, with, the, failure, of, pope, pius, ii, s, plans, to, organize, a, promised, crusade, against, the, ottomans, meant, that, none, of, skanderbeg, s, victories, permanently, hindered, the, ottomans, from, invading, the, western, balkans, despite, his, brilliance, as, a, military, leader, skanderbeg, s, victories, were, only, delaying, the, final, conquests, the, constant, ottoman, invasions, caused, enormous, destruction, to, albania, greatly, reducing, the, population, and, destroying, flocks, of, livestock, and, crops, besides, surrender, there, was, no, possible, way, skanderbeg, would, be, able, to, halt, the, ottoman, invasions, despite, his, successes, against, them, his, manpower, and, resources, were, insufficient, preventing, him, from, expanding, the, war, efforts, and, driving, the, turks, from, the, albanian, borders, albania, was, therefore, doomed, to, face, an, unending, series, of, ottoman, attacks, until, it, eventually, fell, years, after, his, death, when, the, ottomans, were, gaining, a, firm, foothold, in, the, region, albanian, towns, were, organised, into, four, principal, sanjaks, the, government, fostered, trade, by, settling, a, sizeable, jewish, colony, of, refugees, fleeing, persecution, in, spain, the, city, of, vlor, saw, passing, through, its, ports, imported, merchandise, from, europe, such, as, velvets, cotton, goods, mohairs, carpets, spices, and, leather, from, bursa, and, constantinople, some, citizens, of, vlor, even, had, business, associates, throughout, europe, the, phenomenon, of, islamisation, among, the, albanians, became, primarily, widespread, from, the, 17th, century, and, continued, into, the, 18th, century, islam, offered, them, equal, opportunities, and, advancement, within, the, ottoman, empire, however, motives, for, conversion, were, according, to, some, scholars, diverse, depending, on, the, context, though, the, lack, of, source, material, does, not, help, when, investigating, such, issues, because, of, increasing, suppression, of, catholicism, most, catholic, albanians, converted, in, the, 17th, century, while, orthodox, albanians, followed, suit, mainly, in, the, following, century, since, the, albanians, were, seen, as, strategically, important, they, made, up, a, significant, proportion, of, the, ottoman, military, and, bureaucracy, many, muslim, albanians, attained, important, political, and, military, positions, and, culturally, contributed, to, the, broader, muslim, world, enjoying, this, privileged, position, they, held, various, high, administrative, positions, with, over, two, dozen, albanian, grand, viziers, others, included, members, of, the, prominent, k, pr, l, family, zagan, pasha, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, and, ali, pasha, of, tepelena, furthermore, two, sultans, bayezid, ii, and, mehmed, iii, both, had, mothers, of, albanian, origin, the, albanian, renaissance, was, a, period, with, its, roots, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, continuing, into, the, 19th, century, during, which, the, albanian, people, gathered, spiritual, and, intellectual, strength, for, an, independent, cultural, and, political, life, within, an, independent, nation, modern, albanian, culture, flourished, too, especially, albanian, literature, and, arts, and, was, frequently, linked, to, the, influences, of, the, romanticism, and, enlightenment, principles, prior, to, the, rise, of, nationalism, ottoman, authorities, suppressed, any, expression, of, national, unity, or, conscience, by, the, albanian, people, the, victory, of, russia, over, the, ottoman, empire, following, the, russian, ottoman, wars, resulted, the, execution, of, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, which, assigned, albanian, populated, lands, to, their, slavic, and, greek, neighbours, however, the, united, kingdom, and, austro, hungarian, empire, consequently, blocked, the, arrangement, and, caused, the, treaty, of, berlin, from, this, point, albanians, started, to, organise, themselves, with, the, goal, to, protect, and, unite, the, albanian, populated, lands, into, a, unitary, nation, leading, to, the, formation, of, the, league, of, prizren, the, league, had, initially, the, assistance, of, the, ottoman, authorities, whose, position, was, based, on, the, religious, solidarity, of, muslim, people, and, landlords, connected, with, the, ottoman, administration, they, favoured, and, protected, the, muslim, solidarity, and, called, for, defence, of, muslim, lands, simultaneously, constituting, the, reason, for, titling, the, league, committee, of, the, real, muslims, approximately, 300, muslims, participated, in, the, assembly, composed, by, delegates, from, bosnia, the, administrator, of, the, sanjak, of, prizren, as, representatives, of, the, central, authorities, and, no, delegates, from, vilayet, of, scutari, signed, by, only, 47, muslim, deputies, the, league, issued, the, kararname, that, contained, a, proclamation, that, the, people, from, northern, albania, epirus, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, are, willing, to, defend, the, territorial, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, by, all, possible, means, against, the, troops, of, bulgaria, serbia, and, montenegro, ottomans, authorities, cancelled, their, assistance, when, the, league, under, abdyl, frash, ri, became, focused, on, working, towards, albanian, autonomy, and, requested, merging, four, vilayets, including, kosovo, shkod, r, monastir, and, ioannina, into, a, unified, vilayet, the, albanian, vilayet, the, league, used, military, force, to, prevent, the, annexing, areas, of, plav, and, gusinje, assigned, to, montenegro, after, several, successful, battles, with, montenegrin, troops, such, as, the, battle, of, nov, i, e, the, league, was, forced, to, retreat, from, their, contested, regions, the, league, was, later, defeated, by, the, ottoman, army, sent, by, the, sultan, albania, declared, independence,

vulnerable, to, neighboring, entities, such, as, greece, italy, and, yugoslavia, all, of, which, sought, to, expand, their, influence, this, led, to, political, uncertainty, highlighted, in, 1918,
