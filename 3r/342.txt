460, 000, sq, mi, and, include, the, argentine, provinces, of, buenos, aires, la, pampa, santa, fe, entre, r, os, and, c, rdoba, all, of, uruguay, and, brazil, s, southernmost, state, rio, grande, do, sul, the, vast, plains, are, a, natural, region, interrupted, only, by, the, low, ventana, and, tandil, hills, near, bah, a, blanca, and, tandil, argentina, with, a, height, of, 1, 300, m, 4, 265, ft, and, 500, m, 1, 640, ft, respectively, the, climate, is, temperate, with, precipitation, of, 600, to, 1, 200, mm, 23, 6, to, 47, 2, in, that, is, more, or, less, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, year, making, the, soils, appropriate, for, agriculture, the, area, is, also, one, of, the, distinct, physiography, provinces, of, the, larger, paran, paraguay, plain, division, it, is, considered, that, the, limit, of, the, pampas, plain, is, to, the, north, with, the, atlantic, forest, and, the, great, chaco, plain, to, the, west, with, the, pampas, mountains, and, the, cuyo, region, and, to, the, south, with, patagonia, this, region, has, generally, low, elevations, whose, highest, levels, generally, do, not, exceed, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, in, altitude, the, coastal, areas, and, most, of, the, buenos, aires, province, are, predominantly, plain, with, some, wetlands, and, the, interior, areas, mainly, in, the, southern, part, of, the, brazilian, state, of, rio, grande, do, sul, and, uruguay, have, low, ranges, of, hills, like, serras, de, sudeste, in, brazil, and, cuchilla, grande, in, uruguay, low, hills, covered, by, grasslands, are, called, coxilhas, portuguese, pronunciation, in, portuguese, and, cuchillas, spanish, pronunciation, in, spanish, and, it, is, the, most, typical, landscape, of, the, countryside, areas, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, pampas, the, highest, elevations, of, the, pampas, region, are, found, in, the, sierra, de, la, ventana, mountains, in, the, southern, part, of, buenos, aires, province, with, 1, 239, metres, 4, 065, ft, at, the, summit, of, cerro, tres, picos, the, climate, of, the, pampas, is, generally, temperate, gradually, giving, way, to, a, more, humid, subtropical, climate, in, the, north, cfa, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, with, a, cwa, tendency, drier, winters, in, the, northwestern, edge, a, cold, semi, arid, climate, bsk, on, the, southern, and, western, fringes, like, san, luis, province, western, la, pampa, province, and, southern, buenos, aires, province, and, an, oceanic, climate, cfb, in, the, southeastern, part, in, the, localities, of, mar, del, plata, necochea, tandil, and, the, sierra, de, la, ventana, mountains, argentina, summer, temperatures, are, more, uniform, than, winter, temperatures, generally, ranging, from, 28, to, 33, c, 82, to, 91, f, during, the, day, however, most, cities, in, the, pampas, occasionally, have, high, temperatures, that, push, 38, c, 100, f, as, occurs, when, warm, dry, northerly, winds, blow, from, southern, brazil, northern, argentina, or, paraguay, autumn, arrives, gradually, in, march, and, peaks, in, april, and, may, in, april, highs, range, from, 20, to, 25, c, 68, to, 77, f, and, lows, from, 9, to, 13, c, 48, to, 55, f, the, first, frosts, arrive, in, mid, april, in, the, south, and, late, may, or, early, june, in, the, north, winters, are, generally, mild, but, cold, waves, often, occur, typical, temperatures, range, from, 12, to, 19, c, 54, to, 66, f, during, the, day, and, from, 1, to, 6, c, 34, to, 43, f, at, night, with, strong, northerly, winds, days, of, over, 25, c, 77, f, can, be, recorded, almost, everywhere, and, during, cold, waves, high, temperatures, can, be, only, 6, c, 43, f, frost, occurs, everywhere, in, the, pampas, but, it, is, much, more, frequent, in, the, southwest, than, around, the, parana, and, uruguay, rivers, temperatures, under, 5, c, 23, f, can, occur, everywhere, but, values, of, 10, c, 14, f, or, lower, are, confined, to, the, south, and, west, snow, almost, never, falls, in, the, northernmost, third, and, is, rare, and, light, elsewhere, except, for, exceptional, events, in, which, depths, have, reached, 30, cm, 12, in, springs, are, very, variable, it, is, warmer, than, fall, in, most, areas, especially, in, the, west, but, significantly, colder, along, the, atlantic, violent, storms, are, more, common, as, well, as, wide, temperature, variations, days, of, 35, c, 95, f, can, give, way, to, nights, of, under, 5, c, 41, f, or, even, frost, all, within, only, a, few, days, precipitation, ranges, from, 1, 400, millimetres, 55, in, in, the, northeast, to, about, 400, millimetres, 16, in, or, less, in, the, southern, and, western, edges, it, is, highly, seasonal, in, the, west, with, some, places, recording, averages, of, 120, millimetres, 4, 7, in, monthly, in, the, summer, and, only, 20, millimetres, 0, 79, in, monthly, in, the, winter, the, eastern, areas, have, small, peaks, in, the, fall, and, the, spring, with, relatively, rainy, summers, and, winters, that, are, only, slightly, drier, however, where, summer, rain, falls, as, short, heavy, storms, winter, rain, falls, mostly, as, cold, drizzle, and, so, the, amount, of, rainy, days, is, fairly, constant, very, intense, thunderstorms, are, common, in, the, spring, and, summer, and, it, has, among, the, most, frequent, lightning, and, highest, convective, cloud, tops, in, the, world, the, severe, thunderstorms, produce, intense, hailstorms, both, floods, and, flash, floods, and, the, most, consistently, active, tornado, region, outside, the, central, and, southeastern, us, climate, charts, for, different, locations, of, the, pampas, human, activity, has, caused, major, changes, to, the, wildlife, of, the, pampas, most, big, or, medium, sized, species, such, as, puma, rhea, capybara, plains, viscacha, maned, wolf, marsh, deer, and, pampas, deer, have, lost, their, habitats, especially, due, to, the, spread, of, agriculture, and, ranching, and, are, only, present, in, very, few, relicts, of, the, pampas, other, species, such, as, the, jaguar, and, the, guanaco, have, been, extirpated, completely, from, this, habitat, mammals, that, are, still, fairly, present, include, brazilian, guinea, pig, southern, mountain, cavy, coypu, pampas, fox, geoffroy, s, cat, lesser, grison, white, eared, opossum, molina, s, hog, nosed, skunk, big, lutrine, opossum, big, hairy, armadillo, and, southern, long, nosed, armadillo, bird, species, of, the, pampas, are, ruddy, headed, goose, pampas, meadowlark, hudsonian, godwit, maguari, stork, white, faced, ibis, white, winged, coot, southern, screamer, dot, winged, crake, curve, billed, reedhaunter, burrowing, owl, and, the, rhea, invasive, species, include, the, european, hare, wild, boar, and, house, sparrow, most, of, the, large, mammals, native, to, the, pampas, became, extinct, as, part, of, the, end, pleistocene, extinction, event, of, most, large, mammals, across, the, americas, around, 12, 000, years, ago, notable, former, inhabitants, of, the, pampas, include, the, giant, elephant, sized, ground, sloth, megatherium, americanum, along, side, the, smaller, though, still, large, ground, sloths, mylodon, glossotherium, lestodon, and, catonyx, the, rhinoceros, like, ungulate, toxodon, the, camel, like, macrauchenia, the, gomphothere, elephant, relative, notiomastodon, the, equines, equus, neogeus, and, hippidion, and, the, glyptodonts, car, sized, relatives, of, armadillos, glyptodon, and, doedicurus, the, bear, arctotherium, and, the, sabertooth, cat, smilodon, populator, the, dominant, vegetation, types, are, grassy, prairie, and, grass, steppe, in, which, numerous, species, of, the, grass, genus, stipa, are, particularly, conspicuous, pampas, grass, cortaderia, selloana, is, an, iconic, species, of, the, pampas, vegetation, typically, includes, perennial, grasses, and, herbs, different, strata, of, grasses, occur, because, of, gradients, of, water, availability, why, the, pristine, pampas, were, treeless, regions, has, been, much, debated, perhaps, the, most, commonly, cited, explanation, is, seasonal, drought, a, related, hypothesis, is, that, grass, roots, compete, for, water, and, exclude, tree, seedlings, the, effect, might, be, increased, by, heavy, clayed, soils, which, limit, tap, root, penetration, other, causes, that, have, been, proposed, are, fires, set, by, indigenous, peoples, for, land, clearance, the, existence, of, heavy, bodied, herbivores, and, that, the, pampas, are, relicts, of, drier, past, climates, these, explanations, have, been, criticised, as, mono, causal, overall, we, expect, that, low, propagule, pressure, abiotic, stresses, biotic, resistance, and, a, paucity, of, specific, symbionts, might, have, exerted, a, synergistic, influence, in, slowing, tree, invasion, rates, the, world, wildlife, fund, divides, the, pampas, into, three, distinct, ecoregions, the, uruguayan, savanna, lies, east, of, the, paran, river, and, includes, all,

mild, and, summers, are, hot, and, humid, rainfall, is, fairly, uniform, throughout, the, year, but, is, a, little, heavier, during, the, summer, annual, rainfall, is, heaviest, near, the, coast, and, decreases, gradually, further, inland, rain, during, the, late, spring, and, summer, usually, arrives, in, the, form, of, brief, heavy, showers, and, thunderstorms, more, general, rainfall, occurs, the, remainder, of, the, year, as, cold, fronts, and, storm, systems, move, through, although, cold, spells, during, the, winter, often, send, nighttime, temperatures, below, freezing, snow, is,

colonization, schemes, to, settle, the, land, and, later, as, tenant, farmers, working, as, either, a, sharecropper, or, as, paid, laborers, for, absentee, landowners, in, an, attempt, to, make, a, living, for, themselves, however, many, immigrants, eventually, moved, to, more, permanent, employment, in, cities, as, industrialization, picked, up, after, the, 1930s, as, a, result, argentina, s, history, of, immigration, in, buenos, aires, province, is, typically, associated, with, cities, and, urban, life, unlike, in, entre, r, os, province, and, santa, fe, province, where, european, immigration, took, on, a, more, rural, profile
