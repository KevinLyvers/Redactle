wallachia, this, ruler, shifted, his, allegiances, towards, poland, notably, engaging, moldavian, forces, on, the, polish, side, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, and, the, siege, of, marienburg, and, placed, his, own, choice, of, rulers, in, wallachia, his, reign, was, one, of, the, most, successful, in, moldavia, s, history, for, all, of, his, success, it, was, under, the, reign, of, alexander, i, that, the, first, confrontation, with, the, ottoman, turks, took, place, at, cetatea, alb, in, 1420, a, deep, crisis, was, to, follow, alexander, l, s, long, reign, with, his, successors, battling, each, other, in, a, succession, of, wars, that, divided, the, country, until, the, murder, of, bogdan, ii, and, the, accession, of, peter, aaron, in, 1451, nevertheless, moldavia, was, subject, to, further, hungarian, interventions, after, that, moment, as, matthias, corvinus, deposed, aaron, and, backed, alex, ndrel, to, the, throne, in, suceava, peter, aaron, s, rule, also, signified, the, beginning, of, moldavia, s, ottoman, empire, allegiance, as, the, ruler, was, the, first, to, agree, to, pay, tribute, to, sultan, mehmed, ii, peter, aaron, was, eventually, ousted, by, his, nephew, stephen, the, great, who, would, become, the, most, important, medieval, moldavian, ruler, who, managed, to, uphold, moldavia, s, autonomy, against, hungary, poland, and, the, ottoman, empire, under, his, rule, which, lasted, 47, years, moldavia, experienced, a, glorious, political, and, cultural, period, during, this, time, moldavia, was, invaded, repeatedly, by, crimean, tatars, and, beginning, in, the, 15th, century, by, the, ottoman, turks, in, 1538, the, principality, became, a, tributary, to, the, ottoman, empire, but, it, retained, internal, and, partial, external, autonomy, nonetheless, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, continued, to, strongly, influence, moldavia, both, through, national, politics, as, well, as, on, the, local, level, through, significant, intermarriage, between, moldavian, nobility, and, the, polish, szlachta, when, in, may, 1600, michael, the, brave, removed, ieremia, movil, from, moldavia, s, throne, by, winning, the, battle, of,
