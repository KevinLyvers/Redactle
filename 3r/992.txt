for, the, arabic, name, of, the, city, macoraba, another, ancient, city, name, mentioned, by, claudius, ptolemy, felix, arabia, felix, was, also, claimed, to, be, mecca, some, studies, have, questioned, this, association, many, etymologies, have, been, proposed, the, traditional, one, is, that, it, is, derived, from, the, old, south, arabian, root, m, k, r, b, which, means, temple, another, name, used, for, mecca, in, the, quran, is, at, 6, 92, where, it, is, called, umm, al, qur, meaning, mother, of, all, settlements, the, city, has, been, called, several, other, names, in,

desert, of, paran, mentioned, in, the, old, testament, at, genesis, 21, 21, arab, and, islamic, tradition, holds, that, the, wilderness, of, paran, broadly, speaking, is, the, tihamah, coastal, plain, and, the, site, where, ishmael, settled, was, mecca, yaqut, al, hamawi, the, 12th, century, syrian, geographer, wrote, that, f, r, n, was, an, arabized, hebrew, word, one, of, the, names, of, mecca, mentioned, in, the, torah, in, 2010, mecca, and, the, surrounding, area, became, an, important, site, for, paleontology, with, respect, to, primate, evolution, with, the, discovery, of, a, saadanius, fossil, saadanius, is, considered, to, be, a, primate, closely, related, to, the, common, ancestor, of, the, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, the, fossil, habitat, near, what, is, now, the, red, sea, in, western, saudi, arabia, was, a, damp, forest, area, between, 28, million, and, 29, million, years, ago, paleontologists, involved, in, the, research, hope, to, find, further, fossils, in, the, area, the, early, history, of, mecca, is, still, largely, shrouded, by, a, lack, of, clear, sources, the, city, lies, in, the, hinterland, of, the, middle, part, of, western, arabia, of, which, there, are, sparse, textual, or, archaeological, sources, available, this, lack, of, knowledge, is, in, contrast, to, both, the, northern, and, southern, areas, of, western, arabia, specifically, the, syro, palestinian, frontier, and, yemen, where, historians, have, various, sources, available, such, as, physical, remains, of, shrines, inscriptions, observations, by, greco, roman, authors, and, information, collected, by, church, historians, the, area, of, hejaz, that, surrounds, mecca, was, characterized, by, its, remote, rocky, and, inhospitable, nature, supporting, only, meagre, settled, populations, in, scattered, oases, and, occasional, stretches, of, fertile, land, the, red, sea, coast, offered, no, easily, accessible, ports, and, the, oasis, dwellers, and, bedouins, in, the, region, were, illiterate, while, one, individual, has, suggested, that, mecca, s, population, at, the, time, of, muhammad, was, around, 550, research, published, by, binimad, al, ateeqi, in, 2020, shows, that, the, population, was, closer, to, 10, 000, individuals, a, figure, extrapolated, from, data, taken, from, historical, records, about, the, battle, of, badr, and, other, military, expeditions, emigrants, to, both, abyssinia, and, madinah, and, muhammad, s, own, household, al, ateeqi, a, researcher, from, kuwait, who, has, written, extensively, about, the, early, history, of, mecca, also, makes, deductions, about, the, numbers, of, women, children, servants, and, slaves, living, in, mecca, at, the, time, pointing, out, that, some, wealthy, individuals, such, as, abdullah, ibn, jud, an, had, as, many, as, 100, slaves, the, first, clear, reference, to, mecca, in, non, islamic, literature, appears, in, 741, ce, long, after, the, death, of, muhammad, in, the, byzantine, arab, chronicle, though, here, the, author, places, the, region, in, mesopotamia, rather, than, the, hejaz, possible, earlier, mentions, are, not, unambiguous, the, greek, historian, diodorus, siculus, writes, about, arabia, in, the, 1st, century, bce, in, his, work, bibliotheca, historica, describing, a, holy, shrine, and, a, temple, has, been, set, up, there, which, is, very, holy, and, exceedingly, revered, by, all, arabians, claims, have, been, made, this, could, be, a, reference, to, the, ka, bah, in, mecca, however, the, geographic, location, diodorus, describes, is, located, in, northwest, arabia, around, the, area, of, leuke, kome, within, the, former, nabataean, kingdom, and, the, roman, province, of, arabia, petraea, ptolemy, lists, the, names, of, 50, cities, in, arabia, one, going, by, the, name, of, macoraba, there, has, been, speculation, since, 1646, that, this, could, be, a, reference, to, mecca, historically, there, has, been, a, general, consensus, in, scholarship, that, macoraba, mentioned, by, ptolemy, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, is, indeed, mecca, but, more, recently, this, has, been, questioned, bowersock, favors, the, identity, of, the, former, with, his, theory, being, that, macoraba, is, the, word, makkah, followed, by, the, aggrandizing, aramaic, adjective, rabb, great, the, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, also, enumerated, many, cities, of, western, arabia, most, of, which, can, be, identified, according, to, bowersock, he, did, mention, mecca, as, geapolis, or, hierapolis, the, latter, one, meaning, holy, city, potentially, referring, to, the, sanctuary, of, the, kaaba, patricia, crone, from, the, revisionist, school, of, islamic, studies, on, the, other, hand, writes, that, the, plain, truth, is, that, the, name, macoraba, has, nothing, to, do, with, that, of, mecca, if, ptolemy, mentions, mecca, at, all, he, calls, it, moka, a, town, in, arabia, petraea, procopius, 6th, century, statement, that, the, ma, ad, tribe, possessed, the, coast, of, western, arabia, between, the, ghassanids, and, the, himyarites, of, the, south, supports, the, arabic, sources, tradition, that, associates, quraysh, as, a, branch, of, the, ma, add, and, muhammad, as, a, direct, descendant, of, ma, ad, ibn, adnan, historian, patricia, crone, has, cast, doubt, on, the, claim, that, mecca, was, a, major, historical, trading, outpost, however, other, scholars, such, as, glen, w, bowersock, disagree, and, assert, that, mecca, was, a, major, trading, outpost, crone, later, on, disregarded, some, of, her, theories, she, argues, that, meccan, trade, relied, on, skins, hides, manufactured, leather, goods, clarified, butter, hijazi, woollens, and, camels, she, suggests, that, most, of, these, goods, were, destined, for, the, roman, army, which, is, known, to, have, required, colossal, quantities, of, leather, and, hides, for, its, equipment, mecca, is, mentioned, in, the, following, early, quranic, manuscripts, the, earliest, muslim, inscriptions, are, from, the, mecca, ta, if, area, islamic, narrative, in, the, islamic, view, the, beginnings, of, mecca, are, attributed, to, the, biblical, figures, adam, abraham, hagar, and, ishmael, it, was, adam, himself, who, built, the, first, god, s, house, in, mecca, according, to, a, heavenly, prototype, but, this, building, was, destroyed, in, the, noahic, flood, the, civilization, of, mecca, is, believed, to, have, started, after, ibr, h, m, abraham, left, his, son, ism, l, ishmael, and, wife, h, jar, hagar, in, the, valley, at, allah, s, command, some, people, from, the, yemeni, tribe, of, jurhum, settled, with, them, and, isma, il, reportedly, married, two, women, one, after, divorcing, the, first, on, ibrahim, s, advice, at, least, one, man, of, the, jurhum, helped, ism, l, and, his, father, to, construct, or, according, to, islamic, narratives, reconstruct, the, ka, bah, cube, which, would, have, social, religious, political, and, historical, implications, for, the, site, and, region, muslims, see, the, mention, of, a, pilgrimage, at, the, valley, of, the, bakha, in, the, old, testament, chapter, psalm, 84, 3, 6, as, a, reference, to, mecca, similar, to, the, quran, at, surah, 3, 96, in, the, shar, al, as, r, a, commentary, on, the, samaritan, midrashic, chronology, of, the, patriarchs, of, unknown, date, but, probably, composed, in, the, 10th, century, ce, it, is, claimed, that, mecca, was, built, by, the, sons, of, nebaioth, the, eldest, son, of, ism, l, or, ishmael, thamudic, inscriptions, some, thamudic, inscriptions, which, were, discovered, in, the, south, jordan, contained, names, of, some, individuals, such, as, abd, mekkat, servant, of, mecca, there, were, also, some, other, inscriptions, which, contained, personal, names, such, as, makki, makkan, of, makkah, but, jawwad, ali, from, the, university, of, baghdad, suggested, that, there, s, also, a, probability, of, a, tribe, named, makkah, sometime, in, the, 5th, century, the, ka, bah, was, a, place, of, worship, for, the, deities, of, arabia, s, pagan, tribes, mecca, s, most, important, pagan, deity, was, hubal, which, had, been, placed, there, by, the, ruling, quraish, tribe, and, remained, until, the, conquest, of, mecca, by, muhammad, in, the, 5th, century, the, quraish, took, control, of, mecca, and, became, skilled, merchants, and, traders, in, the, 6th, century, they, joined, the, lucrative, spice, trade, since, battles, elsewhere, were, diverting, trade, routes, from, dangerous, sea, routes, to, more, secure, overland, routes, the, byzantine, empire, had, previously, controlled, the, red, sea, but, piracy, had, been, increasing, another, previous, route, that, ran, through, the, persian, gulf, via, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, was, also, being, threatened, by, exploitations, from, the, sassanid, empire, and, was, being, disrupted, by, the, lakhmids, the, ghassanids, and, the, roman, persian, wars, mecca, s, prominence, as, a, trading, center, also, surpassed, the, cities, of, petra, and, palmyra, the, sassanids, however, did, not, always, pose, a, threat, to, mecca, as, in, 575, ce, they, protected, it, from, a, yemeni, invasion, led, by, its, christian, leader, abraha, the, tribes, of, southern, arabia, asked, the, persian, king, khosrau, i, for, aid, in, response, to, which, he, came, south, to, arabia, with, foot, soldiers, and, a, fleet, of, ships, near, mecca, by, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, there, were, three, major, settlements, in, northern, arabia, all, along, the, south, western, coast, that, borders, the, red, sea, in, a, habitable, region, between, the, sea, and, the, hejaz, mountains, to, the, east, although, the, area, around, mecca, was, completely, barren, it, was, the, wealthiest, of, the, three, settlements, with, abundant, water, from, the, renowned, zamzam, well, and, a, position, at, the, crossroads, of, major, caravan, routes, the, harsh, conditions, and, terrain, of, the, arabian, peninsula, meant, a, near, constant, state, of, conflict, between, the, local, tribes, but, once, a, year, they, would, declare, a, truce, and, converge, upon, mecca, in, an, annual, pilgrimage, up, to, the, 7th, century, this, journey, was, intended, for, religious, reasons, by, the, pagan, arabs, to, pay, homage, to, their, shrine, and, to, drink, zamzam, however, it, was, also, the, time, each, year, that, disputes, would, be, arbitrated, debts, would, be, resolved, and, trading, would, occur, at, meccan, fairs, these, annual, events, gave, the, tribes, a, sense, of, common, identity, and, made, mecca, an, important, focus, for, the, peninsula, the, year, of, the, elephant, 570, ce, the, year, of, the, elephant, is, the, name, in, islamic, history, for, the, year, approximately, equating, to, 570, 572, ce, when, according, to, islamic, sources, such, as, ibn, ishaq, abraha, descended, upon, mecca, riding, an, elephant, with, a, large, army, after, building, a, cathedral, at, san, aa, named, al, qullays, in, honor, of, the, negus, of, axum, it, gained, widespread, fame, even, gaining, attention, from, the, byzantine, empire, abraha, attempted, to, divert, the, pilgrimage, of, the, arabs, from, the, ka, bah, to, al, qullays, effectively, converting, them, to, christianity, according, to, islamic, tradition, this, was, the, year, of, muhammad, s, birth, abraha, allegedly, sent, a, messenger, named, muhammad, ibn, khuza, i, to, mecca, and, tihamah, with, a, message, that, al, qullays, was, both, much, better, than, other, houses, of, worship, and, purer, having, not, been, defiled, by, the, housing, of, idols, when, muhammad, ibn, khuza, i, got, as, far, as, the, land, of, kinana, the, people, of, the, lowland, knowing, what, he, had, come, for, sent, a, man, of, hudhayl, called, urwa, bin, hayyad, al, milasi, who, shot, him, with, an, arrow, killing, him, his, brother, qays, who, was, with, him, fled, to, abraha, and, told, him, the, news, which, increased, his, rage, and, fury, and, he, swore, to, raid, the, kinana, tribe, and, destroy, the, ka, bah, ibn, ishaq, further, states, that, one, of, the, men, of, the, quraysh, tribe, was, angered, by, this, and, going, to, sana, a, entering, the, church, at, night, and, defiling, it, widely, assumed, to, have, done, so, by, defecating, in, it, abraha, marched, upon, the, ka, bah, with, a, large, army, which, included, one, or, more, war, elephants, intending, to, demolish, it, when, news, of, the, advance, of, his, army, came, the, arab, tribes, of, quraysh, kinanah, khuza, a, and, hudhayl, united, in, the, defense, of, the, ka, bah, and, the, city, a, man, from, the, himyarite, kingdom, was, sent, by, abraha, to, advise, them, that, abraha, only, wished, to, demolish, the, ka, bah, and, if, they, resisted, they, would, be, crushed, abdul, muttalib, told, the, meccans, to, seek, refuge, in, the, hills, while, he, and, some, members, of, the, quraysh, remained, within, the, precincts, of, the, kaaba, abraha, sent, a, dispatch, inviting, abdul, muttalib, to, meet, with, abraha, and, discuss, matters, when, abdul, muttalib, left, the, meeting, he, was, heard, saying, the, owner, of, this, house, is, its, defender, and, i, am, sure, he, will, save, it, from, the, attack, of, the, adversaries, and, will, not, dishonor, the, servants, of, his, house, abraha, eventually, attacked, mecca, however, the, lead, elephant, known, as, mahmud, is, said, to, have, stopped, at, the, boundary, around, mecca, and, refused, to, enter, it, has, been, theorized, that, an, epidemic, such, as, by, smallpox, could, have, caused, such, a, failed, invasion, of, mecca, the, reference, to, the, story, in, quran, is, rather, short, according, to, the, 105th, surah, of, the, quran, al, fil, the, next, day, a, dark, cloud, of, small, birds, sent, by, allah, appeared, the, birds, carried, small, rocks, in, their, beaks, and, bombarded, the, ethiopian, forces, and, smashed, them, to, a, state, like, that, of, eaten, straw, economy, camel, caravans, said, to, have, first, been, used, by, muhammad, s, great, grandfather, were, a, major, part, of, mecca, s, bustling, economy, alliances, were, struck, between, the, merchants, in, mecca, and, the, local, nomadic, tribes, who, would, bring, goods, leather, livestock, and, metals, mined, in, the, local, mountains, to, mecca, to, be, loaded, on, the, caravans, and, carried, to, cities, in, shaam, and, iraq, historical, accounts, also, provide, some, indication, that, goods, from, other, continents, may, also, have, flowed, through, mecca, goods, from, africa, and, the, far, east, passed, through, en, route, to, syria, including, spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and, slaves, in, return, mecca, received, money, weapons, cereals, and, wine, which, in, turn, were, distributed, throughout, arabia, the, meccans, signed, treaties, with, both, the, byzantines, and, the, bedouins, and, negotiated, safe, passages, for, caravans, giving, them, water, and, pasture, rights, mecca, became, the, center, of, a, loose, confederation, of, client, tribes, which, included, those, of, the, banu, tamim, other, regional, powers, such, as, the, abyssinians, ghassanids, and, lakhmids, were, in, decline, leaving, meccan, trade, to, be, the, primary, binding, force, in, arabia, in, the, late, 6th, century, muhammad, was, born, in, mecca, in, 570, ce, and, thus, islam, has, been, inextricably, linked, with, it, ever, since, he, was, born, into, the, faction, of, banu, hashim, in, the, ruling, tribe, of, quraysh, it, was, in, the, nearby, mountain, cave, of, hira, on, jabal, al, nour, that, muhammad, began, receiving, divine, revelations, from, god, through, the, archangel, jibreel, in, 610, ce, according, to, islamic, tradition, advocating, his, form, of, abrahamic, monotheism, against, meccan, paganism, and, after, enduring, persecution, from, the, pagan, tribes, for, 13, years, muhammad, emigrated, hijrah, in, 622, ce, with, his, companions, the, muhajirun, to, yathrib, later, renamed, medina, the, conflict, between, the, quraysh, and, the, muslims, is, accepted, to, have, begun, at, this, point, overall, meccan, efforts, to, annihilate, islam, failed, and, proved, to, be, costly, and, unsuccessful, during, the, battle, of, the, trench, in, 627, ce, the, combined, armies, of, arabia, were, unable, to, defeat, muhammad, s, forces, as, the, trench, surrounding, muhammad, s, forces, protected, them, from, harm, and, a, storm, was, sent, to, breach, the, quraysh, tribe, in, 628, ce, muhammad, and, his, followers, wanted, to, enter, mecca, for, pilgrimage, but, were, blocked, by, the, quraysh, subsequently, muslims, and, meccans, entered, into, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyyah, whereby, the, quraysh, and, their, allies, promised, to, cease, fighting, muslims, and, their, allies, and, promised, that, muslims, would, be, allowed, into, the, city, to, perform, the, pilgrimage, the, following, year, it, was, meant, to, be, a, ceasefire, for, 10, years, however, just, two, years, later, the, banu, bakr, allies, of, the, quraish, violated, the, truce, by, slaughtering, a, group, of, the, banu, khuza, ah, allies, of, the, muslims, muhammad, and, his, companions, now, 10, 000, strong, marched, into, mecca, and, conquered, the, city, the, pagan, imagery, was, destroyed, by, muhammad, s, followers, and, the, location, islamized, and, rededicated, to, the, worship, of, allah, alone, mecca, was, declared, the, holiest, site, in, islam,

battuta, however, states, these, were, all, destroyed, by, the, prophet, in, the, year, of, victory, battuta, describes, the, ka, bah, in, his, time, as, an, important, part, of, mecca, due, to, the, fact, that, many, people, make, the, pilgrimage, to, it, battuta, describes, the, people, of, the, city, as, being, humble, and, kind, and, also, willing, to, give, a, part, of, everything, they, had, to, someone, who, had, nothing, the, inhabitants, of, mecca, and, the, village, itself, he, says, were, very, clean, there, was, also, a, sense, of, elegance, to, the, village, under, the, ottomans,

carried, out, by, the, saudi, government, which, connected, the, two, holy, cities, of, medina, and, mecca, with, the, modern, haramain, high, speed, railway, system, which, runs, at, 300, km, h, 190,

saudis, are, employed, year, round, to, oversee, the, hajj, and, staff, the, hotels, and, shops, that, cater, to, pilgrims, these, workers, in, turn, have, increased, the, demand, for, housing, and,
