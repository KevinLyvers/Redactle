120, 000, sq, mi, the, gulf, is, surrounded, on, the, north, west, and, southwest, by, the, coastlines, of, thailand, hence, the, name, on, the, northeast, by, cambodia, and, the, mekong, delta, region, of, vietnam, and, opens, to, the, south, china, sea, in, the, southeast, the, modern, thai, name, of, the, gulf, is, ao, thai, thai, thai, gulf, and, gulf, of, thailand, has, been, adopted, as, the, official, name, of, the, body, by, the, international, hydrographic, organization, its, name, in, malay, is, gulf, of, siam, teluk, siam, or, in, jawi, script, and, in, khmer, chhoung, samut, siem, in, thai, the, gulf, is, historically, known, as, ao, sayam, thai, in, vietnamese, it, is, known, as, v, nh, th, i, lan, it, is, generally, identified, with, the, great, gulf, latin, magnus, sinus, known, to, greek, roman, arab, persian, and, renaissance, cartographers, before, the, influx, of, portuguese, explorers, removed, the, phantom, dragon, tail, peninsula, from, european, world, maps, in, the, 16th, century, the, gulf, of, thailand, historically, known, as, the, gulf, of, siam, derives, its, name, from, the, historical, kingdom, of, siam, the, former, name, of, modern, day, thailand, the, term, gulf, of, siam, was, widely, used, in, western, cartography, and, geographical, references, up, until, the, mid, 20th, century, reflecting, the, colonial, era, practice, of, naming, regions, based, on, the, prevalent, local, political, entities, at, the, time, siam, itself, is, an, exonym, believed, to, have, origins, in, the, sanskrit, word, syama, which, means, dark, or, brown, referring, to, the, skin, tone, of, the, region, s, inhabitants, the, term, siam, was, used, internationally, until, 1939, when, the, country, officially, changed, its, name, to, thailand, following, this, renaming, gulf, of, thailand, gradually, became, the, more, commonly, used, term, especially, in, official, contexts, although, gulf, of, siam, is, still, occasionally, used, the, gulf, of, thailand, is, bordered, by, cambodia, thailand, malaysia, and, vietnam, it, occupies, a, seabed, area, of, 304, 000, km, 2, from, 6, n, to, 13, 30, n, latitude, and, 99, e, to, 104, e, longitude, 250, the, northern, tip, of, the, gulf, is, the, bay, of, bangkok, at, the, mouth, of, the, chao, phraya, river, the, southern, boundary, of, the, gulf, is, defined, by, a, line, from, cape, bai, bung, in, southern, vietnam, just, south, of, the, mouth, of, the, mekong, river, to, the, town, of, tumpat, and, pengkalan, chepa, on, the, malaysian, coast, the, gulf, is, relatively, shallow, its, mean, depth, is, 58, metres, 190, ft, and, the, maximum, depth, is, only, 85, metres, 279, ft, 250, this, makes, water, exchange, slow, and, the, strong, water, inflow, from, the, rivers, reduces, the, level, of, salinity, in, the, gulf, 3, 05, 3, 25, percent, and, enriches, the, sediments, only, at, greater, depths, does, water, with, a, higher, salinity, 3, 4, percent, flow, into, the, gulf, from, the, south, china, sea, it, fills, the, central, depression, below, a, depth, of, 50, metres, 160, ft, the, main, rivers, which, empty, into, the, gulf, are, the, chao, phraya, including, its, distributary, tha, chin, river, the, mae, klong, and, bang, pakong, rivers, at, the, bay, of, bangkok, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, tapi, river, flowing, into, bandon, bay, in, the, southwest, of, the, gulf, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, southern, limit, of, the, gulf, as, line, running, from, the, western, extreme, of, cambodia, or, camau, point, 8, 36, n, to, the, northern, extreme, of, the, point, on, the, east, side, of, the, estuary, of, the, kelantan, river, 6, 14, n, 102, 15, e, 6, 233, n, 102, 250, e, 6, 233, 102, 250, the, seabed, morphology, in, the, central, depression, of, the, gulf, is, characterised, by, the, presence, of, elongated, mounds, and, ridges, arranged, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, basin, this, morphology, widespread, within, the, gulf, in, water, depths, exceeding, 50, m, covers, an, area, of, tens, of, thousands, of, square, kilometres, it, reflects, an, interaction, between, sediment, dewatering, and, the, erosional, activity, of, the, present, day, bottom, currents, the, sediment, dewatering, and, fluid, seepage, result, in, the, formation, of, numerous, small, pits, and, pockmarks, the, long, term, erosion, imposed, by, currents, of, stable, orientation, modifies, pockmarks, into, long, runnels, and, depressions, and, ultimately, leads, to, the, formation, of, the, large, fields, of, elongated, mounds, and, ridges, as, well, as, the, residual, outliers, of, un, eroded, mud, and, clay, sheets, the, larger, islands, in, the, gulf, include, there, are, 75, 590, rai, of, coral, reef, in, the, gulf, of, which, five, percent, are, considered, to, be, in, fertile, condition, in, 2010, severe, coral, bleaching, occurred, at, most, reef, sites, in, the, country, bleaching, of, reefs, in, the, andaman, sea, was, more, severe, and, extensive, than, that, in, the, gulf, of, thailand, in, 2016, coral, bleaching, was, detected, at, ko, thalu, and, ko, lueam, in, prachuap, khiri, khan, province, for, the, first, time, scientists, have, determined, that, bleaching, starts, when, seawater, temperature, rises, beyond, 30, c, for, more, than, three, weeks, given, the, prolonged, period, of, temperatures, up, to, 32, c, at, ko, thalu, in, prachuap, khiri, khan, five, to, ten, percent, of, corals, in, the, area, are, already, bleached, coastal, water, monitoring, results, in, 2015, from, 202, sampling, locations, collected, twice, annually, indicate, that, no, thai, coastal, waters, were, found, to, be, in, excellent, condition, sixteen, percent, of, coastal, water, was, of, good, quality, 72, percent, was, of, fair, quality, 9, percent, was, of, poor, quality, and, 3, percent, was, of, very, poor, quality, the, quality, of, all, coastal, waters, exhibited, similar, percentages, most, were, of, fair, quality, except, for, the, inner, gulf, of, thailand, where, the, coastal, water, was, poor, to, very, poor, in, comparison, to, coastal, water, quality, as, measured, in, 2014, water, quality, has, deteriorated, 52, some, gulf, waters, off, chachoengsao, province, samut, sakhon, province, samut, prakan, province, bangkok, rayong,
