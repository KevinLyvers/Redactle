indo, australian, plate, and, the, eurasian, plate, a, significant, part, somewhere, between, 28, and, 50, percent, of, the, karakoram, range, is, glaciated, covering, an, area, of, more, than, 15, 000, square, kilometres, or, 5, 800, square, miles, compared, to, between, 8, and, 12, percent, of, the, himalaya, and, 2, 2, percent, of, the, alps, mountain, glaciers, may, serve, as, an, indicator, of, climate, change, advancing, and, receding, with, long, term, changes, in, temperature, and, precipitation, the, karakoram, glaciers, are, slightly, retreating, unlike, the, himalayas, where, glaciers, are, losing, mass, at, significantly, higher, rate, many, karakoram, glaciers, are, covered, in, a, layer, of, rubble, which, insulates, the, ice, from, the, warmth, of, the, sun, where, there, is, no, such, insulation, the, rate, of, retreat, is, high, in, the, last, ice, age, a, connected, series, of, glaciers, stretched, from, western, tibet, to, nanga, parbat, and, from, the, tarim, basin, to, the, gilgit, district, to, the, south, the, indus, glacier, was, the, main, valley, glacier, which, flowed, 120, kilometres, 75, mi, down, from, nanga, parbat, massif, to, 870, metres, 2, 850, ft, elevation, in, the, north, the, karakoram, glaciers, joined, those, from, the, kunlun, mountains, and, flowed, down, to, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, in, the, tarim, basin, while, the, current, valley, glaciers, in, the, karakoram, reach, a, maximum, length, of, 76, kilometres, 47, mi, several, of, the, ice, age, valley, glacier, branches, and, main, valley, glaciers, had, lengths, up, to, 700, kilometres, 430, mi, during, the, ice, age, the, glacier, snowline, was, about, 1, 300, metres, 4, 300, ft, lower, than, today, legend, 1, k2, 2, gasherbrum, i, k5, 3, broad,
