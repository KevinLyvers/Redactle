of, kyi, ukrainian, russian, rom, ky, or, kiy, the, legendary, eponymous, founder, of, the, city, according, to, oleg, trubachyov, s, etymological, dictionary, from, the, old, east, slavic, name, kyjev, gord, literally, kyi, s, castle, kyi, s, gord, from, proto, slavic, kyjev, this, etymology, has, been, questioned, for, instance, by, mykhailo, hrushevsky, who, called, it, an, etymological, myth, and, meant, that, the, names, of, the, legendary, founders, are, in, turn, based, on, place, names, according, to, the, canadian, ukrainian, linguist, jaroslav, rudnyckyj, the, name, can, be, connected, to, the, proto, slavic, root, kyj, but, should, be, interpreted, as, meaning, stick, pole, as, in, its, modern, ukrainian, equivalent, the, name, should, in, that, case, be, interpreted,
