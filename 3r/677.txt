polynesia, uk, p, l, n, i, z, i, pol, in, ee, zee, us, n, i, ee, zh, is, a, subregion, of, oceania, made, up, of, more, than, 1, 000, islands, scattered, over, the, central, and, southern, pacific, ocean, the, indigenous, people, who, inhabit, the, islands, of, polynesia, are, called, polynesians, they, have, many, things, in, common, including, linguistic, relations, cultural, practices, and, traditional, beliefs, in, centuries, past, they, had, a, strong, shared, tradition, of, sailing, and, using, stars, to, navigate, at, night, the, term, polyn, sie, was, first, used, in, 1756, by, the, french, writer, charles, de, brosses, who, originally, applied, it, to, all, the, islands, of, the, pacific, in, 1831, jules, dumont, d, urville, proposed, a, narrower, definition, during, a, lecture, at, the, soci, t, de, g, ographie, of, paris, by, tradition, the, islands, located, in, the, southern, pacific, have, also, often, been, called, the, south, sea, islands, and, their, inhabitants, have, been, called, south, sea, islanders, the, hawaiian, islands, have, often, been, considered, to, be, part, of, the, south, sea, islands, because, of, their, relative, proximity, to, the, southern, pacific, islands, even, though, they, are, in, fact, located, in, the, north, pacific, another, term, in, use, which, avoids, this, inconsistency, is, the, polynesian, triangle, from, the, shape, created, by, the, layout, of, the, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, this, term, makes, clear, that, the, grouping, includes, the, hawaiian, islands, which, are, located, at, the, northern, vertex, of, the, referenced, triangle, polynesia, is, characterized, by, a, small, amount, of, land, spread, over, a, very, large, portion, of, the, mid, and, southern, pacific, ocean, it, comprises, approximately, 300, 000, to, 310, 000, square, kilometres, 117, 000, to, 118, 000, sq, mi, of, land, of, which, more, than, 270, 000, km, 2, 103, 000, sq, mi, are, within, new, zealand, the, hawaiian, archipelago, comprises, about, half, the, remainder, most, polynesian, islands, and, archipelagos, including, the, hawaiian, islands, and, samoa, are, composed, of, volcanic, islands, built, by, hotspots, volcanoes, the, other, land, masses, in, polynesia, new, zealand, norfolk, island, and, ouv, a, the, polynesian, outlier, near, new, caledonia, are, the, unsubmerged, portions, of, the, largely, sunken, continent, of, zealandia, zealandia, is, believed, to, have, mostly, sunk, below, sea, level, 23, million, years, ago, and, recently, partially, resurfaced, due, to, a, change, in, the, movements, of, the, pacific, plate, in, relation, to, the, indo, australian, plate, the, pacific, plate, had, previously, been, subducted, under, the, australian, plate, when, that, changed, it, had, the, effect, of, uplifting, the, portion, of, the, continent, that, is, modern, day, new, zealand, the, convergent, plate, boundary, that, runs, northwards, from, new, zealand, s, north, island, is, called, the, kermadec, tonga, subduction, zone, this, subduction, zone, is, associated, with, the, volcanism, that, gave, rise, to, the, kermadec, and, tongan, islands, there, is, a, transform, fault, that, currently, traverses, new, zealand, s, south, island, known, as, the, alpine, fault, zealandia, s, continental, shelf, has, a, total, area, of, approximately, 3, 600, 000, km, 2, 1, 400, 000, sq, mi, the, oldest, rocks, in, polynesia, are, found, in, new, zealand, and, are, believed, to, be, about, 510, million, years, old, the, oldest, polynesian, rocks, outside, zealandia, are, to, be, found, in, the, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, and, are, 80, million, years, old, polynesia, is, generally, defined, as, the, islands, within, the, polynesian, triangle, although, some, islands, inhabited, by, polynesians, are, situated, outside, the, polynesian, triangle, geographically, the, polynesian, triangle, is, drawn, by, connecting, the, points, of, hawaii, new, zealand, and, easter, island, the, other, main, island, groups, located, within, the, polynesian, triangle, are, samoa, tonga, the, cook, islands, tuvalu, tokelau, niue, wallis, and, futuna, and, french, polynesia, also, small, polynesian, settlements, are, in, papua, new, guinea, the, solomon, islands, the, caroline, islands, and, vanuatu, an, island, group, with, strong, polynesian, cultural, traits, outside, of, this, great, triangle, is, rotuma, situated, north, of, fiji, the, people, of, rotuma, have, many, common, polynesian, traits, but, speak, a, non, polynesian, language, some, of, the, lau, islands, to, the, southeast, of, fiji, have, strong, historic, and, cultural, links, with, tonga, however, in, essence, polynesia, remains, a, cultural, term, referring, to, one, of, the, three, parts, of, oceania, the, others, being, melanesia, and, micronesia, the, following, islands, and, island, groups, are, either, nations, or, overseas, territories, of, former, colonial, powers, the, residents, are, native, polynesians, or, contain, archaeological, evidence, indicating, polynesian, settlement, in, the, past, some, islands, of, polynesian, origin, are, outside, the, general, triangle, that, geographically, defines, the, region, the, line, islands, and, the, phoenix, islands, most, of, which, are, parts, of, kiribati, had, no, permanent, settlements, until, european, colonization, but, are, often, considered, to, be, parts, of, the, polynesian, triangle, polynesians, once, inhabited, the, auckland, islands, the, kermadec, islands, and, norfolk, island, in, pre, colonial, times, but, these, islands, were, uninhabited, by, the, time, european, explorers, arrived, the, oceanic, islands, to, the, east, of, easter, island, such, as, clipperton, island, the, gal, pagos, islands, and, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, were, in, the, past, formerly, categorized, on, rare, occasion, as, part, of, polynesia, no, evidence, of, prehistoric, contact, with, either, polynesians, or, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, has, been, found, the, polynesian, people, are, considered, by, linguistic, archaeological, and, human, genetic, evidence, a, subset, of, the, sea, migrating, austronesian, people, tracing, polynesian, languages, places, their, prehistoric, origins, in, island, melanesia, maritime, southeast, asia, and, ultimately, in, taiwan, between, about, 3000, and, 1000, bc, speakers, of, austronesian, languages, spread, from, taiwan, into, maritime, southeast, asia, there, are, three, theories, regarding, the, spread, of, humans, across, the, pacific, to, polynesia, these, are, outlined, well, by, kayser, et, al, 2000, and, are, as, follows, in, the, archaeological, record, there, are, well, defined, traces, of, this, expansion, which, allow, the, path, it, took, to, be, followed, and, dated, with, some, certainty, it, is, thought, that, by, roughly, 1400, bc, lapita, peoples, so, named, after, their, pottery, tradition, appeared, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, of, northwest, melanesia, this, culture, is, seen, as, having, adapted, and, evolved, through, time, and, space, since, its, emergence, out, of, taiwan, they, had, given, up, rice, production, for, instance, which, required, paddy, field, agriculture, unsuitable, for, small, islands, however, they, still, cultivated, other, ancestral, austronesian, staple, cultigens, like, dioscorea, yams, and, taro, the, latter, are, still, grown, with, smaller, scale, paddy, field, technology, as, well, as, adopting, new, ones, like, breadfruit, and, sweet, potato, the, results, of, research, at, the, teouma, lapita, site, efate, island, vanuatu, and, the, talasiu, lapita, site, near, nuku, alofa, tonga, published, in, 2016, supports, the, express, train, model, although, with, the, qualification, that, the, migration, bypassed, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, the, conclusion, from, research, published, in, 2016, is, that, the, initial, population, of, those, two, sites, appears, to, come, directly, from, taiwan, or, the, northern, philippines, and, did, not, mix, with, the, australo, papuans, of, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, the, preliminary, analysis, of, skulls, found, at, the, teouma, and, talasiu, lapita, sites, is, that, they, lack, australian, or, papuan, affinities, and, instead, have, affinities, to, mainland, asian, populations, a, 2017, dna, analysis, of, modern, polynesians, indicates, that, there, has, been, intermarriage, resulting, in, a, mixed, austronesian, papuan, ancestry, of, the, polynesians, as, with, other, modern, austronesians, with, the, exception, of, taiwanese, aborigines, research, at, the, teouma, and, talasiu, lapita, sites, implies, that, the, migration, and, intermarriage, which, resulted, in, the, mixed, austronesian, papuan, ancestry, of, the, polynesians, occurred, after, the, first, initial, migration, to, vanuatu, and, tonga, a, complete, mtdna, and, genome, wide, snp, comparison, pugach, et, al, 2021, of, the, remains, of, early, settlers, of, the, mariana, islands, and, early, lapita, individuals, from, vanuatu, and, tonga, also, suggest, that, both, migrations, originated, directly, from, the, same, ancient, austronesian, source, population, from, the, philippines, the, complete, absence, of, papuan, admixture, in, the, early, samples, indicates, that, these, early, voyages, bypassed, eastern, indonesia, and, the, rest, of, new, guinea, the, authors, have, also, suggested, a, possibility, that, the, early, lapita, austronesians, were, direct, descendants, of, the, early, colonists, of, the, marianas, which, preceded, them, by, about, 150, years, which, is, also, supported, by, pottery, evidence, the, most, eastern, site, for, lapita, archaeological, remains, recovered, so, far, is, at, mulifanua, on, upolu, the, mulifanua, site, where, 4, 288, pottery, shards, have, been, found, and, studied, has, a, true, age, of, c, 1000, bc, based, on, radiocarbon, dating, and, is, the, oldest, site, yet, discovered, in, polynesia, this, is, mirrored, by, a, 2010, study, also, placing, the, beginning, of, the, human, archaeological, sequences, of, polynesia, in, tonga, at, 900, bc, within, a, mere, three, or, four, centuries, between, 1300, and, 900, bc, the, lapita, archaeological, culture, spread, 6, 000, km, further, to, the, east, from, the, bismarck, archipelago, until, reaching, as, far, as, fiji, tonga, and, samoa, a, cultural, divide, began, to, develop, between, fiji, to, the, west, and, the, distinctive, polynesian, language, and, culture, emerging, on, tonga, and, samoa, to, the, east, where, there, was, once, faint, evidence, of, uniquely, shared, developments, in, fijian, and, polynesian, speech, most, of, this, is, now, called, borrowing, and, is, thought, to, have, occurred, in, those, and, later, years, more, than, as, a, result, of, continuing, unity, of, their, earliest, dialects, on, those, far, flung, lands, contacts, were, mediated, especially, through, the, tovata, confederacy, of, fiji, this, is, where, most, fijian, polynesian, linguistic, interactions, occurred, in, the, chronology, of, the, exploration, and, first, populating, of, polynesia, there, is, a, gap, commonly, referred, to, as, the, long, pause, between, the, first, populating, of, fiji, melanesia, western, polynesia, of, tonga, and, samoa, among, others, and, the, settlement, of, the, rest, of, the, region, in, general, this, gap, is, considered, to, have, lasted, roughly, 1, 000, years, the, cause, of, this, gap, in, voyaging, is, contentious, among, archaeologists, with, a, number, of, competing, theories, presented, including, climate, shifts, the, need, for, the, development, of, new, voyaging, techniques, and, cultural, shifts, after, the, long, pause, dispersion, of, populations, into, central, and, eastern, polynesia, began, although, the, exact, timing, of, when, each, island, group, was, settled, is, debated, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, island, groups, in, the, geographic, center, of, the, region, i, e, the, cook, islands, society, islands, marquesas, islands, etc, were, settled, initially, between, 1000, and, 1150, ad, and, ending, with, more, far, flung, island, groups, such, as, hawaii, new, zealand, and, easter, island, settled, between, 1200, and, 1300, ad, tiny, populations, may, have, been, involved, in, the, initial, settlement, of, individual, islands, although, professor, matisoo, smith, of, the, otago, study, said, that, the, founding, m, ori, population, of, new, zealand, must, have, been, in, the, hundreds, much, larger, than, previously, thought, the, polynesian, population, experienced, a, founder, effect, and, genetic, drift, the, polynesian, may, be, distinctively, different, both, genotypically, and, phenotypically, from, the, parent, population, from, which, it, is, derived, this, is, due, to, new, population, being, established, by, a, very, small, number, of, individuals, from, a, larger, population, which, also, causes, a, loss, of, genetic, variation, atholl, anderson, wrote, that, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, female, and, y, chromosome, male, concluded, that, the, ancestors, of, polynesian, women, were, austronesians, while, those, of, polynesian, men, were, papuans, subsequently, it, was, found, that, 96, or, 93, 8, of, polynesian, mtdna, has, an, asian, origin, as, does, one, third, of, polynesian, y, chromosomes, the, remaining, two, thirds, from, new, guinea, and, nearby, islands, this, is, consistent, with, matrilocal, residence, patterns, polynesians, existed, from, the, intermixing, of, few, ancient, austronesian, melanesian, founders, genetically, they, belong, almost, entirely, to, the, haplogroup, b, mtdna, which, is, the, marker, of, austronesian, expansions, the, high, frequencies, of, mtdna, haplogroup, b, in, the, polynesians, are, the, result, of, founder, effect, and, represents, the, descendants, of, a, few, austronesian, females, who, intermixed, with, papuan, males, a, genomic, analysis, of, modern, populations, in, polynesia, published, in, 2021, provides, a, model, of, the, direction, and, timing, of, polynesian, migrations, from, samoa, to, the, islands, to, the, east, this, model, presents, consistencies, and, inconsistencies, with, models, of, polynesian, migration, that, are, based, on, archaeology, and, linguistic, analysis, the, 2021, genomic, model, presents, a, migration, pathway, from, samoa, to, the, cook, islands, rarotonga, then, to, the, society, islands, t, taiete, m, in, the, 11th, century, ad, the, western, austral, islands, tuha, a, pae, and, the, tu, motu, archipelago, in, the, 12th, century, ad, with, the, migrant, pathway, branching, to, the, north, to, the, marquesas, te, henua, enana, to, raivavae, in, the, south, and, to, the, easternmost, destination, on, easter, island, rapa, nui, which, was, settled, in, approximately, 1200, ad, via, mangareva, the, polynesians, were, matrilineal, and, matrilocal, stone, age, societies, upon, their, arrival, in, tonga, samoa, and, the, surrounding, islands, after, having, spent, at, least, some, time, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, the, modern, polynesians, still, show, human, genetic, results, of, a, melanesian, culture, which, allowed, indigenous, men, but, not, women, to, marry, in, useful, evidence, for, matrilocality, although, matrilocality, and, matrilineality, receded, at, some, early, time, polynesians, and, most, other, austronesian, speakers, in, the, pacific, islands, were, and, are, still, highly, matricentric, in, their, traditional, jurisprudence, the, lapita, pottery, for, which, the, general, archaeological, complex, of, the, earliest, oceanic, austronesian, speakers, in, the, pacific, islands, are, named, also, lapsed, in, western, polynesia, language, social, life, and, material, culture, were, very, distinctly, polynesian, by, 1000, bc, early, european, observers, detected, theocratic, elements, in, traditional, polynesian, government, linguistically, there, are, five, sub, groups, of, the, polynesian, language, group, each, represents, a, region, within, polynesia, and, the, categorization, of, these, language, groups, by, green, in, 1966, helped, to, confirm, that, polynesian, settlement, generally, took, place, from, west, to, east, there, is, a, very, distinct, east, polynesian, subgroup, with, many, shared, innovations, not, seen, in, other, polynesian, languages, the, marquesas, dialects, are, perhaps, the, source, of, the, oldest, hawaiian, speech, which, is, overlaid, by, tahitian, variety, speech, as, hawaiian, oral, histories, would, suggest, the, earliest, varieties, of, new, zealand, maori, speech, may, have, had, multiple, sources, from, around, central, eastern, polynesia, as, maori, oral, histories, would, suggest, the, cook, islands, are, made, up, of, 15, islands, comprising, the, northern, and, southern, groups, the, islands, are, spread, out, across, many, kilometers, of, a, vast, ocean, the, largest, of, these, islands, is, called, rarotonga, which, is, also, the, political, and, economic, capital, of, the, nation, the, cook, islands, were, formerly, known, as, the, hervey, islands, but, this, name, refers, only, to, the, northern, groups, it, is, unknown, when, this, name, was, changed, to, reflect, the, current, name, it, is, thought, that, the, cook, islands, were, settled, in, two, periods, the, tahitian, period, when, the, country, was, settled, between, 900, and, 1300, ad, and, the, maui, settlement, which, occurred, in, 1600, ad, when, a, large, contingent, from, tahiti, settled, in, rarotonga, in, the, takitumu, district, the, first, contact, between, europeans, and, the, native, inhabitants, of, the, cook, islands, took, place, in, 1595, with, the, arrival, of, spanish, explorer, lvaro, de, menda, a, in, pukapuka, who, called, it, san, bernardo, saint, bernard, a, decade, later, navigator, pedro, fern, ndez, de, quir, s, made, the, first, european, landing, in, the, islands, when, he, set, foot, on, rakahanga, in, 1606, calling, it, gente, hermosa, beautiful, people, cook, islanders, are, ethnically, polynesians, or, eastern, polynesia, they, are, culturally, associated, with, tahiti, eastern, islands, nz, maori, and, hawaii, the, lau, islands, were, subject, to, periods, of, tongan, rulership, and, then, fijian, control, until, their, eventual, conquest, by, seru, epenisa, cakobau, of, the, kingdom, of, fiji, by, 1871, in, around, 1855, a, tongan, prince, enele, ma, afu, proclaimed, the, lau, islands, as, his, kingdom, and, took, the, title, tui, lau, fiji, had, been, ruled, by, numerous, divided, chieftains, until, cakobau, unified, the, landmass, the, lapita, culture, the, ancestors, of, the, polynesians, existed, in, fiji, from, about, 3500, bc, until, they, were, displaced, by, the, melanesians, about, a, thousand, years, later, both, samoans, and, subsequent, polynesian, cultures, adopted, melanesian, painting, and, tattoo, methods, in, 1873, cakobau, ceded, a, fiji, heavily, indebted, to, foreign, creditors, to, the, united, kingdom, it, became, independent, on, 10, october, 1970, and, a, republic, on, 28, september, 1987, fiji, is, classified, as, melanesian, and, less, commonly, polynesian, beginning, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, polynesians, began, to, migrate, in, waves, to, new, zealand, via, their, canoes, settling, on, both, the, north, and, south, islands, as, well, as, the, chatham, islands, over, the, course, of, several, centuries, the, polynesian, settlers, formed, distinct, cultures, that, became, known, as, the, m, ori, on, the, new, zealand, mainland, while, those, who, settled, in, the, chatham, islands, became, the, moriori, people, beginning, the, 17th, century, the, arrival, of, europeans, to, new, zealand, drastically, impacted, m, ori, culture, settlers, from, europe, known, as, p, keh, began, to, colonize, new, zealand, in, the, 19th, century, leading, to, tension, with, the, indigenous, m, ori, on, october, 28, 1835, a, group, of, m, ori, tribesmen, issued, a, declaration, of, independence, drafted, by, scottish, businessman, james, busby, as, the, united, tribes, of, new, zealand, in, order, to, resist, potential, efforts, at, colonizing, new, zealand, by, the, french, and, prevent, merchant, ships, and, their, cargo, which, belonged, to, m, ori, merchants, from, being, seized, at, foreign, ports, the, new, state, received, recognition, from, the, british, crown, in, 1836, in, 1840, royal, navy, officer, william, hobson, and, several, m, ori, chiefs, signed, the, treaty, of, waitangi, which, transformed, new, zealand, into, a, colony, of, the, british, empire, and, granting, all, m, ori, the, status, of, british, subjects, however, tensions, between, p, keh, settlers, and, the, m, ori, over, settler, encroachment, on, m, ori, lands, and, disputes, over, land, sales, led, to, the, new, zealand, wars, 1845, 1872, between, the, colonial, government, and, the, m, ori, in, response, to, the, conflict, the, colonial, government, initiated, a, series, of, land, confiscations, from, the, m, ori, this, social, upheaval, combined, with, epidemics, of, infectious, diseases, from, europe, devastated, both, the, m, ori, population, and, their, social, standing, in, new, zealand, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, maori, population, began, to, recover, and, efforts, were, made, to, redress, social, economic, political, and, economic, issues, facing, the, m, ori, in, wider, new, zealand, society, beginning, in, the, 1960s, a, protest, movement, emerged, seeking, redress, for, historical, grievances, in, the, 2013, new, zealand, census, roughly, 600, 000, people, in, new, zealand, identified, as, being, m, ori, in, the, 9th, century, the, tui, manu, a, controlled, a, vast, maritime, empire, comprising, most, of, the, settled, islands, of, polynesia, the, tui, manu, a, is, one, of, the, oldest, samoan, titles, in, samoa, traditional, oral, literature, of, samoa, and, manu, a, talks, of, a, widespread, polynesian, network, or, confederacy, or, empire, that, was, prehistorically, ruled, by, the, successive, tui, manu, a, dynasties, manuan, genealogies, and, religious, oral, literature, also, suggest, that, the, tui, manu, a, had, long, been, one, of, the, most, prestigious, and, powerful, paramount, of, samoa, oral, history, suggests, that, the, tui, manu, a, kings, governed, a, confederacy, of, far, flung, islands, which, included, fiji, tonga, as, well, as, smaller, western, pacific, chiefdoms, and, polynesian, outliers, such, as, uvea, futuna, tokelau, and, tuvalu, commerce, and, exchange, routes, between, the, western, polynesian, societies, are, well, documented, and, it, is, speculated, that, the, tui, manu, a, dynasty, grew, through, its, success, in, obtaining, control, over, the, oceanic, trade, of, currency, goods, such, as, finely, woven, ceremonial, mats, whale, ivory, tabua, obsidian, and, basalt, tools, chiefly, red, feathers, and, seashells, reserved, for, royalty, such, as, polished, nautilus, and, the, egg, cowry, samoa, s, long, history, of, various, ruling, families, continued, until, well, after, the, decline, of, the, tui, manu, a, s, power, with, the, western, isles, of, savai, i, and, upolu, rising, to, prominence, in, the, post, tongan, occupation, period, and, the, establishment, of, the, tafa, ifa, system, that, dominated, samoan, politics, well, into, the, 20th, century, this, was, disrupted, in, the, early, 1900s, due, to, colonial, intervention, with, east, west, division, by, tripartite, convention, 1899, and, subsequent, annexation, by, the, german, empire, and, the, united, states, the, german, controlled, western, portion, of, samoa, consisting, of, the, bulk, of, samoan, territory, savai, i, apolima, manono, and, upolu, was, occupied, by, new, zealand, in, wwi, and, administered, by, it, under, a, class, c, league, of, nations, mandate, after, repeated, efforts, by, the, samoan, independence, movement, the, new, zealand, western, samoa, act, of, 24, november, 1961, granted, samoa, independence, effective, on, january, 1, 1962, upon, which, the, trusteeship, agreement, terminated, the, new, independent, state, of, samoa, was, not, a, monarchy, though, the, malietoa, titleholder, remained, very, influential, it, effectively, ended, however, with, the, death, of, malietoa, tanumafili, ii, the, country, s, head, of, state, on, may, 11, 2007, in, the, 10th, century, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, was, established, in, tonga, and, most, of, the, western, pacific, came, within, its, sphere, of, influence, up, to, parts, of, the, solomon, islands, the, tongan, influence, brought, polynesian, customs, and, language, throughout, most, of, polynesia, the, empire, began, to, decline, in, the, 13th, century, after, a, bloody, civil, war, political, power, in, tonga, eventually, fell, under, the, tu, i, kanokupolu, dynasty, in, the, 16th, century, in, 1845, the, ambitious, young, warrior, strategist, and, orator, t, ufa, hau, united, tonga, into, a, more, western, style, kingdom, he, held, the, chiefly, title, of, tu, i, kanokupolu, but, had, been, baptised, with, the, name, jiaoji, george, in, 1831, in, 1875, with, the, help, of, the, missionary, shirley, waldemar, baker, he, declared, tonga, a, constitutional, monarchy, formally, adopted, the, western, royal, style, emancipated, the, serfs, enshrined, a, code, of, law, land, tenure, and, freedom, of, the, press, and, limited, the, power, of, the, chiefs, tonga, became, a, british, protectorate, under, a, treaty, of, friendship, on, 18, may, 1900, when, european, settlers, and, rival, tongan, chiefs, tried, to, oust, the, second, king, within, the, british, empire, which, posted, no, higher, permanent, representative, on, tonga, than, a, british, consul, 1901, 1970, tonga, formed, part, of, the, british, western, pacific, territories, under, a, high, commissioner, who, residing, in, fiji, from, 1901, until, 1952, despite, being, under, the, protectorate, tonga, retained, its, monarchy, without, interruption, on, june, 4, 1970, the, kingdom, of, tonga, became, independent, from, the, british, empire, the, reef, islands, and, atolls, of, tuvalu, are, identified, as, being, part, of, west, polynesia, during, pre, european, contact, times, there, was, frequent, canoe, voyaging, between, the, islands, as, polynesian, navigation, skills, are, recognised, to, have, allowed, deliberate, journeys, on, double, hull, sailing, canoes, or, outrigger, canoes, eight, of, the, nine, islands, of, tuvalu, were, inhabited, thus, the, name, tuvalu, means, eight, standing, together, in, tuvaluan, the, pattern, of, settlement, that, is, believed, to, have, occurred, is, that, the, polynesians, spread, out, from, samoa, and, tonga, into, the, tuvaluan, atolls, with, tuvalu, providing, a, stepping, stone, for, migration, into, the, polynesian, outlier, communities, in, melanesia, and, micronesia, stories, as, to, the, ancestors, of, the, tuvaluans, vary, from, island, to, island, on, niutao, funafuti, and, vaitupu, the, founding, ancestor, is, described, as, being, from, samoa, whereas, on, nanumea, the, founding, ancestor, is, described, as, being, from, tonga, the, extent, of, influence, of, the, tu, i, tonga, line, of, tongan, kings, which, originated, in, the, 10th, century, is, understood, to, have, extended, to, some, of, the, islands, of, tuvalu, in, the, 11th, to, mid, 13th, century, the, oral, history, of, niutao, recalls, that, in, the, 15th, century, tongan, warriors, were, defeated, in, a, battle, on, the, reef, of, niutao, tongan, warriors, also, invaded, niutao, later, in, the, 15th, century, and, again, were, repelled, a, third, and, fourth, tongan, invasion, of, niutao, occurred, in, the, late, 16th, century, again, with, the, tongans, being, defeated, tuvalu, was, first, sighted, by, europeans, in, january, 1568, during, the, voyage, of, spanish, navigator, lvaro, de, menda, a, de, neira, who, sailed, past, the, island, of, nui, and, charted, it, as, isla, de, jes, s, spanish, for, island, of, jesus, because, the, previous, day, was, the, feast, of, the, holy, name, menda, a, made, contact, with, the, islanders, but, did, not, land, during, menda, a, s, second, voyage, across, the, pacific, he, passed, niulakita, in, august, 1595, which, he, named, la, solitaria, meaning, the, solitary, one, fishing, was, the, primary, source, of, protein, with, the, tuvaluan, cuisine, reflecting, food, that, could, be, grown, on, low, lying, atolls, navigation, between, the, islands, of, tuvalu, was, carried, out, using, outrigger, canoes, the, population, levels, of, the, low, lying, islands, of, tuvalu, had, to, be, managed, because, of, the, effects, of, periodic, droughts, and, the, risk, of, severe, famine, if, the, gardens, were, poisoned, by, salt, from, the, storm, surge, of, a, tropical, cyclone, the, sweet, potato, called, k, mara, in, m, ori, and, kumar, in, quechua, is, native, to, the, americas, and, was, widespread, in, polynesia, when, europeans, first, reached, the, pacific, remains, of, the, plant, in, the, cook, islands, have, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, 1000, and, the, present, scholarly, consensus, is, that, it, was, brought, to, central, polynesia, c, 700, by, polynesians, who, had, traveled, to, south, america, and, back, from, where, it, spread, across, the, region, some, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, sweet, potatoes, may, have, reached, polynesia, via, seeds, at, least, 100, 000, years, ago, pre, dating, human, arrival, however, this, hypothesis, fails, to, account, for, the, similarity, of, names, there, are, also, other, possible, material, and, cultural, evidence, of, pre, columbian, contact, by, polynesia, with, the, americas, with, varying, levels, of, plausibility, these, include, chickens, coconuts, and, bottle, gourds, the, question, of, whether, polynesians, reached, the, americas, and, the, extent, of, cultural, and, material, influences, resulting, from, such, a, contact, remains, highly, contentious, among, anthropologists, one, of, the, most, enduring, misconceptions, about, polynesians, was, that, they, originated, from, the, americas, this, was, due, to, thor, heyerdahl, s, proposals, in, the, mid, 20th, century, that, the, polynesians, had, migrated, in, two, waves, of, migrations, one, by, native, americans, from, the, northwest, coast, of, canada, by, large, whale, hunting, dugouts, and, the, other, from, south, america, by, bearded, white, men, with, reddish, to, blond, hair, and, blue, grey, eyes, led, by, a, high, priest, and, sun, king, named, kon, tiki, on, balsa, log, rafts, he, claimed, the, white, men, then, civilized, the, dark, skinned, natives, in, polynesia, he, set, out, to, prove, this, by, embarking, on, a, highly, publicized, kon, tiki, expedition, on, a, primitive, raft, with, a, scandinavian, crew, it, captured, the, public, s, attention, making, the, kon, tiki, a, household, name, none, of, heyerdahl, s, proposals, have, been, accepted, in, the, scientific, community, the, anthropologist, wade, davis, in, his, book, the, wayfinders, criticized, heyerdahl, as, having, ignored, the, overwhelming, body, of, linguistic, ethnographic, and, ethnobotanical, evidence, augmented, today, by, genetic, and, archaeological, data, indicating, that, he, was, patently, wrong, anthropologist, robert, carl, suggs, included, a, chapter, titled, the, kon, tiki, myth, in, his, 1960, book, on, polynesia, concluding, that, the, kon, tiki, theory, is, about, as, plausible, as, the, tales, of, atlantis, mu, and, children, of, the, sun, like, most, such, theories, it, makes, exciting, light, reading, but, as, an, example, of, scientific, method, it, fares, quite, poorly, other, authors, have, also, criticized, heyerdahl, s, hypothesis, for, its, implicit, racism, in, attributing, advances, in, polynesian, society, to, white, people, at, the, same, time, ignoring, relatively, advanced, austronesian, maritime, technology, in, favor, of, a, primitive, balsa, raft, in, july, 2020, a, novel, high, density, genome, wide, dna, analysis, of, polynesians, and, native, south, americans, reported, that, there, has, been, intermingling, between, polynesian, people, and, pre, columbian, zen, people, in, a, period, dated, between, 1150, and, 1380, ad, whether, this, happened, because, of, indigenous, american, people, reaching, eastern, polynesia, or, because, the, northern, coast, of, south, america, was, visited, by, polynesians, is, not, clear, yet, polynesia, divides, into, two, distinct, cultural, groups, east, polynesia, and, west, polynesia, the, culture, of, west, polynesia, is, conditioned, to, high, populations, it, has, strong, institutions, of, marriage, and, well, developed, judicial, monetary, and, trading, traditions, west, polynesia, comprises, the, groups, of, tonga, samoa, and, surrounding, islands, the, pattern, of, settlement, to, east, polynesia, began, from, samoan, islands, into, the, tuvaluan, atolls, with, tuvalu, providing, a, stepping, stone, to, migration, into, the, polynesian, outlier, communities, in, melanesia, and, micronesia, eastern, polynesian, cultures, are, highly, adapted, to, smaller, islands, and, atolls, principally, niue, the, cook, islands, tahiti, the, tuamotus, the, marquesas, hawaii, rapa, nui, and, smaller, central, pacific, groups, the, large, islands, of, new, zealand, were, first, settled, by, eastern, polynesians, who, adapted, their, culture, to, a, non, tropical, environment, unlike, western, melanesia, leaders, were, chosen, in, polynesia, based, on, their, hereditary, bloodline, samoa, however, had, another, system, of, government, that, combines, elements, of, heredity, and, real, world, skills, to, choose, leaders, this, system, is, called, fa, amatai, according, to, ben, r, finney, and, eric, m, jones, on, tahiti, for, example, the, 35, 000, polynesians, living, there, at, the, time, of, european, discovery, were, divided, between, high, status, persons, with, full, access, to, food, and, other, resources, and, low, status, persons, with, limited, access, religion, farming, fishing, weather, prediction, out, rigger, canoe, similar, to, modern, catamarans, construction, and, navigation, were, highly, developed, skills, because, the, population, of, an, entire, island, depended, on, them, trading, of, both, luxuries, and, mundane, items, was, important, to, all, groups, periodic, droughts, and, subsequent, famines, often, led, to, war, many, low, lying, islands, could, suffer, severe, famine, if, their, gardens, were, poisoned, by, the, salt, from, the, storm, surge, of, a, tropical, cyclone, in, these, cases, fishing, the, primary, source, of, protein, would, not, ease, the, loss, of, food, energy, navigators, in, particular, were, highly, respected, and, each, island, maintained, a, house, of, navigation, with, a, canoe, building, area, settlements, by, the, polynesians, were, of, two, categories, the, hamlet, and, the, village, the, size, of, the, island, inhabited, determined, whether, or, not, a, hamlet, would, be, built, the, larger, volcanic, islands, usually, had, hamlets, because, of, the, many, zones, that, could, be, divided, across, the, island, food, and, resources, were, more, plentiful, these, settlements, of, four, to, five, houses, usually, with, gardens, were, established, so, that, there, would, be, no, overlap, between, the, zones, villages, on, the, other, hand, were, built, on, the, coasts, of, smaller, islands, and, consisted, of, thirty, or, more, houses, in, the, case, of, atolls, on, only, one, of, the, group, so, that, food, cultivation, was, on, the, others, usually, these, villages, were, fortified, with, walls, and, palisades, made, of, stone, and, wood, however, new, zealand, demonstrates, the, opposite, large, volcanic, islands, with, fortified, villages, as, well, as, being, great, navigators, these, people, were, artists, and, artisans, of, great, skill, simple, objects, such, as, fish, hooks, would, be, manufactured, to, exacting, standards, for, different, catches, and, decorated, even, when, the, decoration, was, not, part, of, the, function, stone, and, wooden, weapons, were, considered, to, be, more, powerful, the, better, they, were, made, and, decorated, in, some, island, groups, weaving, was, a, strong, part, of, the, culture, and, gifting, woven, articles, was, an, ingrained, practice, dwellings, were, imbued, with, character, by, the, skill, of, their, building, body, decoration, and, jewelry, is, of, an, international, standard, to, this, day, the, religious, attributes, of, polynesians, were, common, over, the, whole, pacific, region, while, there, are, some, differences, in, their, spoken, languages, they, largely, have, the, same, explanation, for, the, creation, of, the, earth, and, sky, for, the, gods, that, rule, aspects, of, life, and, for, the, religious, practices, of, everyday, life, people, traveled, thousands, of, miles, to, celebrations, that, they, all, owned, communally, beginning, in, the, 1820s, large, numbers, of, missionaries, worked, in, the, islands, converting, many, groups, to, christianity, polynesia, argues, ian, breward, is, now, one, of, the, most, strongly, christian, regions, in, the, world, christianity, was, rapidly, and, successfully, incorporated, into, polynesian, culture, war, and, slavery, disappeared, polynesian, languages, are, all, members, of, the, family, of, oceanic, languages, a, sub, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, polynesian, languages, show, a, considerable, degree, of, similarity, the, vowels, are, generally, the, same, a, e, i, o, and, u, pronounced, as, in, italian, spanish, and, german, and, the, consonants, are, always, followed, by, a, vowel, the, languages, of, various, island, groups, show, changes, in, consonants, r, and, v, are, used, in, central, and, eastern, polynesia, whereas, l, and, v, are, used, in, western, polynesia, the, glottal, stop, is, increasingly, represented, by, an, inverted, comma, or, okina, in, the, society, islands, the, original, proto, polynesian, k, and, ng, have, merged, as, glottal, stop, so, the, name, for, the, ancestral, homeland, deriving, from, proto, nuclear, polynesian, sawaiki, becomes, havai, i, in, new, zealand, where, the, original, w, is, used, instead, of, v, the, ancient, home, is, hawaiki, in, the, cook, islands, where, the, glottal, stop, replaces, the, original, s, with, a, likely, intermediate, stage, of, h, it, is, avaiki, in, the, hawaiian, islands, where, the, glottal, stop, replaces, the, original, k, the, largest, island, of, the, group, is, named, hawai, i, in, samoa, where, the, original, s, is, used, instead, of, h, v, replaces, w, and, the, glottal, stop, replaces, the, original, k, the, largest, island, is, called, savai, i, with, the, exception, of, new, zealand, the, majority, of, independent, polynesian, islands, derive, much, of, their, income, from, foreign, aid, and, remittances, from, those, who, live, in, other, countries, some, encourage, their, young, people, to, go, where, they, can, earn, good, money, to, remit, to, their, stay, at, home, relatives, many, polynesian, locations, such, as, easter, island, supplement, this, with, tourism, income, some, have, more, unusual, sources, of, income, such, as, tuvalu, which, marketed, its, tv, internet, top, level, domain, name, or, the, cooks, that, relied, on, postage, stamp, sales, aside, from, new, zealand, another, focus, area, of, economic, dependence, regarding, tourism, is, hawaii, hawaii, is, one, of, the, most, visited, areas, within, the, polynesian, triangle, entertaining, more, than, ten, million, visitors, annually, excluding, 2020, the, economy, of, hawaii, like, that, of, new, zealand, is, steadily, dependent, on, annual, tourists, and, financial, counseling, or, aid, from, other, countries, or, states, the, rate, of, tourist, growth, has, made, the, economy, overly, dependent, on, this, one, sector, leaving, hawaii, extremely, vulnerable, to, external, economic, forces, by, keeping, this, in, mind, island, states, and, nations, similar, to, hawaii, are, paying, closer, attention, to, other, avenues, that, can, positively, affect, their, economy, by, practicing, more, independence, and, less, emphasis, on, tourist, entertainment, the, first, major, attempt, at, uniting, the, polynesian, islands, was, by, imperial, japan, in, the, 1930s, when, various, theorists, chiefly, hachir, arita, began, promulgating, the, idea, of, what, would, soon, become, known, as, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, under, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, all, nations, stretching, from, southeast, asia, and, northeast, asia, to, oceania, would, be, united, under, one, large, cultural, and, economic, bloc, which, would, be, free, from, western, imperialism, the, policy, theorists, who, conceived, it, along, with, the, japanese, public, largely, saw, it, as, a, pan, asian, movement, driven, by, ideals, of, freedom, and, independence, from, western, colonial, oppression, in, practice, however, it, was, frequently, corrupted, by, militarists, who, saw, it, as, an, effective, policy, vehicle, through, which, to, strengthen, japan, s, position, and, advance, its, dominance, within, asia, at, its, greatest, extent, it, stretched, from, japanese, occupied, indochina, in, the, west, to, the, gilbert, islands, in, the, east, although, it, was, originally, planned, to, stretch, as, far, east, as, hawaii, and, easter, island, and, as, far, west, as, india, this, never, came, to, fruition, however, as, japan, was, defeated, during, world, war, ii, and, subsequently, lost, all, power, and, influence, it, had, after, several, years, of, discussing, a, potential, regional, grouping, three, sovereign, states, samoa, tonga, and, tuvalu, and, five, self, governing, but, non, sovereign, territories, formally, launched, in, november, 2011, the, polynesian, leaders, group, intended, to, cooperate, on, a, variety, of, issues, including, culture, and, language, education, responses, to, climate, change, and, trade, and, investment, it, does, not, however, constitute, a, political, or, monetary, union, polynesia, comprised, islands, diffused, throughout, a, triangular, area, with, sides, of, four, thousand, miles, the, area, from, the, hawaiian, islands, in, the, north, to, easter, island, in, the, east, and, to, new, zealand, in, the, south, were, all, settled, by, polynesians, navigators, traveled, to, small, inhabited, islands, using, only, their, own, senses, and, knowledge, passed, by, oral, tradition, from, navigator, to, apprentice, in, order, to, locate, directions, at, various, times, of, day, and, year, navigators, in, eastern, polynesia, memorized, important, facts, the, motion, of, specific, stars, and, where, they, would, rise, on, the, horizon, of, the, ocean, weather, times, of, travel, wildlife, species, which, congregate, at, particular, positions, directions, of, swells, on, the, ocean, and, how, the, crew, would, feel, their, motion, colors, of, the, sea, and, sky, especially, how, clouds, would, cluster, at, the, locations, of, some, islands, and, angles, for, approaching, harbors, these, wayfinding, techniques, along, with, outrigger, canoe, construction, methods, were, kept, as, guild, secrets, generally, each, island, maintained, a, guild, of, navigators, who, had, very, high, status, in, times, of, famine, or, difficulty, these, navigators, could, trade, for, aid, or, evacuate, people, to, neighboring, islands, on, his, first, voyage, of, pacific, exploration, cook, had, the, services, of, a, polynesian, navigator, tupaia, who, drew, a, hand, drawn, chart, of, the, islands, within, 3, 200, km, 2, 000, mi, radius, to, the, north, and, west, of, his, home, island, of, ra, iatea, tupaia, had, knowledge, of, 130, islands, and, named, 74, on, his, chart, tupaia, had, navigated, from, ra, iatea, in, short, voyages, to, 13, islands, he, had, not, visited, western, polynesia, as, since, his, grandfather, s, time, the, extent, of, voyaging, by, raiateans, has, diminished, to, the, islands, of, eastern, polynesia, his, grandfather, and, father, had, passed, to, tupaia, the, knowledge, as, to, the, location, of, the, major, islands, of, western, polynesia, and, the, navigation, information, necessary, to, voyage, to, samoa, tonga, and, melanesian, island, of, fiji, as, the, admiralty, orders, directed, cook, to, search, for, the, great, southern, continent, cook, ignored, tupaia, s, chart, and, his, skills, as, a, navigator, to, this, day, original, traditional, methods, of, polynesian, navigation, are, still, taught, in, the, polynesian, outlier, of, taumako, island, in, the, solomon, islands, from, a, single, chicken, bone, recovered, from, the, archaeological, site, of, el, arenal, 1, on, the, arauco, peninsula, chile, a, 2007, research, report, looking, at, radiocarbon, dating, and, an, ancient, dna, sequence, indicate, that, polynesian, navigators, may, have, reached, the, americas, at, least, 100, years, before, columbus, who, arrived, 1492, ad, introducing, chickens, to, south, america, a, later, report, looking, at, the, same, specimens, concluded, a, published, apparently, pre, columbian, chilean, specimen, and, six, pre, european, polynesian, specimens, also, cluster, with, the, same, european, indian, subcontinental, southeast, asian, sequences, providing, no, support, for, a, polynesian, introduction, of, chickens, to, south, america, in, contrast, sequences, from, two, archaeological, sites, on, easter, island, group, with, an, uncommon, haplogroup, from, indonesia, japan, and, china, and, may, represent, a, genetic, signature, of, an, early, polynesian, dispersal, modeling, of, the, potential, marine, carbon, contribution, to, the, chilean, archaeological, specimen, casts, further, doubt, on, claims, for, pre, columbian, chickens, and, definitive, proof, will, require, further, analyses, of, ancient, dna, sequences, and, radiocarbon, and, stable, isotope, data, from, archaeological, excavations, within, both, chile, and, polynesia, knowledge, of, the, traditional, polynesian, methods, of, navigation, was, largely, lost, after, contact, with, and, colonization, by, europeans, this, left, the, problem, of, accounting, for, the, presence, of, the, polynesians, in, such, isolated, and, scattered, parts, of, the, pacific, by, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, early, 20th, century, a, more, generous, view, of, polynesian, navigation, had, come, into, favor, perhaps, creating, a, romantic, picture, of, their, canoes, seamanship, and, navigational, expertise, in, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, scholars, began, testing, sailing, and, paddling, experiments, related, to, polynesian, navigation, david, lewis, sailed, his, catamaran, from, tahiti, to, new, zealand, using, stellar, navigation, without, instruments, and, ben, finney, built, a, 12, meter, 40, foot, replica, of, a, hawaiian, double, canoe, nalehia, and, tested, it, in, hawaii, meanwhile, micronesian, ethnographic, research, in, the, caroline, islands, revealed, that, traditional, stellar, navigational, methods, were, still, in, everyday, use, recent, re, creations, of, polynesian, voyaging, have, used, methods, based, largely, on, micronesian, methods, and, the, teachings, of, a, micronesian, navigator, mau, piailug, it, is, probable, that, the, polynesian, navigators, employed, a, whole, range, of, techniques, including, use, of, the, stars, the, movement, of, ocean, currents, and, wave, patterns, the, air, and, sea, interference, patterns, caused, by, islands, and, atolls, the, flight, of, birds, the, winds, and, the, weather, scientists, think, that, long, distance, polynesian, voyaging, followed, the, seasonal, paths, of, birds, there, are, some, references, in, their, oral, traditions, to, the, flight, of, birds, and, some, say, that, there, were, range, marks, onshore, pointing, to, distant, islands, in, line, with, these, flyways, one, theory, is, that, they, would, have, taken, a, frigatebird, with, them, these, birds, refuse, to, land, on, the, water, as, their, feathers, will, become, waterlogged, making, it, impossible, to, fly, when, the, voyagers, thought, they, were, close, to, land, they, may, have, released, the, bird, which, would, either, fly, towards, land, or, else, return, to, the, canoe, it, is, likely, that, the, polynesians, also, used, wave, and, swell, formations, to, navigate, it, is, thought, that, the, polynesian, navigators, may, have, measured, the, time, it, took, to, sail, between, islands, in, canoe, days, or, a, similar, type, of, expression, another, navigational, technique, may, have, involved, following, sea, turtle, migrations, while, other, navigational, techniques, may, have, been, sufficient, to, reach, known, islands, some, research, finds, only, sea, turtles, could, have, helped, polynesian, navigators, reach, new, islands, sea, turtle, migrations, are, feasible, for, canoes, to, follow, at, shallow, depths, slower, speeds, and, in, large, groups, this, could, explain, how, polynesians, were, able, to, find, and, settle, the, majority, of, pacific, islands, also, people, of, the, marshall, islands, used, special, devices, called, stick, charts, showing, the, places, and, directions, of, swells, and, wave, breaks, with, tiny, seashells, affixed, to, them, to, mark, the, positions, of, islands, along, the, way, materials, for, these, maps, were, readily, available, on, beaches, and, their, making, was, simple, however, their, effective, use, needed, years, and, years, of, study
