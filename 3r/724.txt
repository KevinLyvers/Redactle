in, the, north, west, of, modern, france, covering, the, western, part, of, what, was, known, as, armorica, during, the, period, of, roman, occupation, it, became, an, independent, kingdom, and, then, a, duchy, before, being, united, with, the, kingdom, of, france, in, 1532, as, a, province, governed, as, a, separate, nation, under, the, crown, brittany, has, also, been, referred, to, as, little, britain, as, opposed, to, great, britain, with, which, it, shares, an, etymology, it, is, bordered, by, the, english, channel, to, the, north, normandy, to, the, northeast, eastern, pays, de, la, loire, to, the, southeast, the, bay, of, biscay, to, the, south, and, the, celtic, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, west, its, land, area, is, 34, 023, km, 2, 13, 136, sq, mi, brittany, is, the, site, of, some, of, the, world, s, oldest, standing, architecture, home, to, the, cairn, of, barnenez, the, tumulus, saint, michel, and, others, which, date, to, the, early, 5th, millennium, bc, today, the, historical, province, of, brittany, is, split, among, five, french, departments, finist, re, in, the, west, c, tes, d, armor, in, the, north, ille, et, vilaine, in, the, northeast, morbihan, in, the, south, and, loire, atlantique, in, the, southeast, loire, atlantique, now, belongs, to, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, while, the, other, four, departments, make, up, the, brittany, region, at, the, 2010, census, the, population, of, historic, brittany, was, estimated, to, be, 4, 475, 295, in, 2017, the, largest, metropolitan, areas, were, nantes, 934, 165, inhabitants, rennes, 733, 320, inhabitants, and, brest, 321, 364, inhabitants, brittany, is, the, traditional, homeland, of, the, breton, people, and, is, one, of, the, six, celtic, nations, retaining, a, distinct, cultural, identity, that, reflects, its, history, a, nationalist, movement, seeks, greater, autonomy, within, the, french, republic, or, independence, from, it, the, reunification, of, brittany, is, supported, by, half, of, the, inhabitants, of, brittany, and, of, loire, atlantique, and, is, considered, a, prerequisite, to, further, autonomy, the, word, brittany, along, with, its, french, breton, and, gallo, equivalents, bretagne, breizh, and, berta, yn, derive, from, the, latin, britannia, which, means, land, of, the, britons, this, word, had, been, used, by, the, romans, since, the, 1st, century, to, refer, to, great, britain, and, more, specifically, the, roman, province, of, britain, this, word, derives, from, a, greek, word, prettanik, or, brettan, ai, used, by, pytheas, an, explorer, from, massalia, who, visited, the, british, isles, around, 320, bc, the, greek, word, itself, comes, from, the, common, brythonic, ethnonym, reconstructed, as, pritan, itself, from, proto, celtic, k, ritanoi, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, k, er, to, cut, make, in, roman, times, armorica, included, what, is, now, brittany, this, was, an, indefinite, region, that, extended, along, the, english, channel, coast, from, the, seine, estuary, then, along, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, loire, estuary, and, according, to, several, sources, maybe, to, the, garonne, estuary, this, term, probably, comes, from, a, gallic, word, aremorica, which, means, close, to, the, sea, another, name, letauia, in, english, litavis, was, used, until, the, 12th, century, it, possibly, means, wide, and, flat, or, to, expand, and, it, gave, the, welsh, name, for, brittany, llydaw, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, many, cornish, britons, settled, in, western, armorica, to, escape, the, saxons, and, the, region, started, to, be, called, britannia, although, this, name, only, replaced, armorica, in, the, sixth, century, or, perhaps, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, breton, speaking, people, may, pronounce, the, word, breizh, in, two, different, ways, according, to, their, region, of, origin, breton, can, be, divided, into, two, main, dialects, the, klt, kerne, leon, tregor, and, the, dialect, of, vannes, klt, speakers, pronounce, it, and, would, write, it, breiz, while, the, vannetais, speakers, pronounce, it, and, would, write, it, breih, the, official, spelling, is, a, compromise, between, both, variants, with, a, z, and, an, h, together, in, 1941, efforts, to, unify, the, dialects, led, to, the, creation, of, the, so, called, breton, zh, a, standard, which, has, never, been, widely, accepted, on, its, side, gallo, has, never, had, a, widely, accepted, writing, system, and, several, ones, coexist, for, instance, the, name, of, the, region, in, that, language, can, be, written, berta, yn, in, elg, script, or, bert, gn, in, moga, and, a, couple, of, other, scripts, also, exist, brittany, has, been, inhabited, by, humans, since, the, lower, palaeolithic, this, population, was, scarce, and, very, similar, to, the, other, neanderthals, found, in, the, whole, of, western, europe, their, only, original, feature, was, a, distinct, culture, called, colombanian, one, of, the, oldest, hearths, in, the, world, has, been, found, in, plouhinec, finist, re, homo, sapiens, settled, in, brittany, around, 35, 000, years, ago, they, replaced, or, absorbed, the, neanderthals, and, developed, local, industries, similar, to, the, ch, telperronian, or, to, the, magdalenian, after, the, last, glacial, period, the, warmer, climate, allowed, the, area, to, become, heavily, wooded, at, that, time, brittany, was, populated, by, relatively, large, communities, who, started, to, change, their, lifestyles, from, a, life, of, hunting, and, gathering, to, become, settled, farmers, agriculture, was, introduced, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, by, migrants, from, the, south, and, east, however, the, neolithic, revolution, in, brittany, did, not, happen, due, to, a, radical, change, of, population, but, by, slow, immigration, and, exchange, of, skills, neolithic, brittany, is, characterised, by, important, megalithic, production, and, sites, such, as, quelf, nnec, it, is, sometimes, designated, as, the, core, area, of, megalithic, culture, the, oldest, monuments, cairns, were, followed, by, princely, tombs, and, stone, rows, the, morbihan, d, partement, on, the, southern, coast, comprises, a, large, share, of, these, structures, including, the, carnac, stones, and, the, broken, menhir, of, er, grah, in, the, locmariaquer, megaliths, the, largest, single, stone, erected, by, neolithic, people, during, the, protohistorical, period, brittany, was, inhabited, by, five, celtic, tribes, those, people, had, strong, economic, ties, to, the, insular, celts, especially, for, the, tin, trade, several, tribes, also, belonged, to, an, armorican, confederation, which, according, to, julius, caesar, gathered, the, curiosolitae, the, redones, the, osismii, the, unelli, the, caletes, the, lemovices, and, the, ambibarii, the, unelli, caletes, and, lemovices, were, respectively, located, in, cotentin, lower, normandy, pays, de, caux, upper, normandy, and, limousin, aquitaine, the, location, of, the, ambibarii, is, unknown, the, caletes, are, sometimes, also, considered, belgians, and, lemovices, is, probably, a, mistake, for, lexovii, lower, normandy, during, the, gallic, wars, the, veneti, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, morbihan, off, the, coast, of, brittany, at, the, conclusion, of, the, gallic, wars, the, region, became, part, of, the, roman, republic, in, 51, bc, it, was, included, in, the, province, of, gallia, lugdunensis, in, 13, bc, gallic, towns, and, villages, were, redeveloped, according, to, roman, standards, and, several, cities, were, created, these, cities, are, condate, rennes, vorgium, carhaix, darioritum, vannes, and, condevincum, or, condevicnum, nantes, together, with, fanum, martis, corseul, they, were, the, capitals, of, the, local, civitates, they, all, had, a, grid, plan, and, a, forum, and, sometimes, a, temple, a, basilica, thermae, or, an, aqueduct, like, carhaix, the, romans, also, built, three, major, roads, through, the, region, however, most, of, the, population, remained, rural, the, free, peasants, lived, in, small, huts, whereas, the, landowners, and, their, employees, lived, in, proper, villae, rusticae, the, gallic, deities, continued, to, be, worshiped, and, were, often, assimilated, to, the, roman, gods, only, a, small, number, of, statues, depicting, roman, gods, were, found, in, brittany, and, most, of, the, time, they, combine, celtic, elements, during, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, region, was, attacked, several, times, by, franks, alamanni, and, pirates, at, the, same, time, the, local, economy, collapsed, and, many, farming, estates, were, abandoned, to, face, the, invasions, many, towns, and, cities, were, fortified, like, nantes, rennes, and, vannes, this, area, was, also, affected, by, the, bagaudae, also, spelled, bacaudae, during, this, period, which, were, groups, of, peasant, insurgents, the, bagaudae, achieved, some, temporary, and, scattered, successes, under, the, leadership, of, members, of, the, underclass, as, well, as, former, members, of, local, ruling, elites, toward, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, the, britons, of, domnon, e, modern, devon, and, cornwall, on, the, south, western, peninsula, of, great, britain, began, to, emigrate, to, armorica, which, is, why, the, breton, language, is, more, closely, related, to, recorded, cornish, the, history, behind, such, an, establishment, is, unclear, but, medieval, breton, angevin, and, welsh, sources, connect, it, to, a, figure, known, as, conan, meriadoc, welsh, literary, sources, assert, that, conan, came, to, armorica, on, the, orders, of, the, roman, usurper, magnus, maximus, who, sent, some, of, his, british, troops, to, gaul, to, enforce, his, claims, and, settled, them, in, armorica, this, account, was, supported, by, the, counts, of, anjou, who, claimed, descent, from, a, roman, soldier, expelled, from, lower, brittany, by, conan, on, magnus, s, orders, the, army, recruited, for, flavius, aetius, to, combat, attila, the, hun, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, included, romans, visigoths, franks, alans, and, armoricans, amongst, others, the, alans, were, placed, front, and, centre, opposite, the, huns, the, armoricans, supplied, archers, who, attacked, the, huns, front, lines, during, the, main, battle, and, thwarted, attila, s, night, assault, on, the, roman, camp, with, a, hail, of, arrows, like, rain, after, the, battle, was, won, aetius, sent, the, alans, to, armorica, and, galicia, the, late, 5th, century, brittonic, leader, riothamus, received, correspondence, from, the, eminent, roman, jurist, sidonius, apollinaris, and, was, called, king, of, the, britons, by, jordanes, some, suggest, that, he, was, a, breton, though, others, believe, that, he, was, from, britain, pointing, to, the, passage, that, he, arrived, in, the, land, of, the, biturges, by, way, of, ocean, which, would, hardly, have, been, efficient, or, required, for, a, breton, both, historians, describe, riothamus, s, losing, battle, against, king, euric, of, the, visigoths, at, d, ols, around, the, year, 470, in, response, to, a, plea, from, the, roman, emperor, anthemius, riothamus, had, led, twelve, thousand, men, to, establish, a, military, presence, in, bourges, in, central, gaul, but, was, betrayed, by, arvandus, the, praetorian, prefect, of, gaul, and, subsequently, ambushed, by, euric, s, army, after, a, long, battle, the, armorican, survivors, escaped, to, avallon, in, burgundy, after, which, they, are, lost, to, history, according, to, breton, king, lists, riotham, survived, and, reigned, as, prince, of, domnonia, until, his, death, sometime, between, 500, and, 520, though, this, may, have, been, a, different, person, regardless, of, the, truth, of, this, story, brythonic, british, celtic, settlement, probably, increased, during, the, anglo, saxon, invasion, of, britain, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, scholars, such, as, l, on, fleuriot, have, suggested, a, two, wave, model, of, migration, from, britain, which, saw, the, emergence, of, an, independent, breton, people, and, established, the, dominance, of, the, brythonic, breton, language, in, armorica, their, petty, kingdoms, are, now, known, by, the, names, of, the, counties, that, succeeded, them, domnon, e, devon, cornouaille, cornwall, l, on, caerleon, but, these, names, in, breton, and, latin, are, in, most, cases, identical, to, their, british, homelands, in, breton, and, french, however, gwened, or, vannetais, continued, the, name, of, the, indigenous, veneti, although, the, details, remain, confused, these, colonies, consisted, of, related, and, intermarried, dynasties, which, repeatedly, unified, as, by, the, 7th, century, saint, judica, l, before, splintering, again, according, to, celtic, inheritance, practices, at, the, beginning, of, the, medieval, era, brittany, was, divided, among, three, kingdoms, domnonea, cornouaille, and, bro, rec, these, realms, eventually, merged, into, a, single, state, during, the, 9th, century, the, unification, of, brittany, was, carried, out, by, nominoe, king, between, 845, and, 851, and, considered, as, the, breton, pater, patriae, among, the, immigrant, britons, there, were, some, clergymen, who, helped, the, evangelisation, of, the, region, which, was, still, pagan, particularly, in, rural, areas, his, son, erispoe, secured, the, independence, of, the, new, kingdom, of, brittany, and, won, the, battle, of, jengland, against, charles, the, bald, the, bretons, won, another, war, in, 867, and, the, kingdom, reached, then, its, maximum, extent, it, received, parts, of, normandy, maine, and, anjou, and, the, channel, islands, brittany, was, heavily, attacked, by, the, vikings, at, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, the, kingdom, lost, its, eastern, territories, including, normandy, and, anjou, and, the, county, of, nantes, was, given, to, fulk, i, of, anjou, in, 909, nantes, was, seized, by, the, vikings, in, 914, at, this, time, brittany, was, also, called, lydwiccum, nantes, was, eventually, liberated, by, alan, ii, of, brittany, in, 937, with, the, support, of, his, godbrother, king, thelstan, of, england, alan, ii, totally, expelled, the, vikings, from, brittany, and, recreated, a, strong, breton, state, for, aiding, in, removing, the, problem, alan, paid, homage, to, louis, iv, of, france, who, was, thelstan, s, nephew, and, had, returned, from, england, in, the, same, year, as, alan, ii, and, thus, brittany, ceased, to, be, a, kingdom, and, became, a, duchy, several, breton, lords, helped, william, the, conqueror, to, invade, england, and, the, bretons, formed, over, a, third, of, the, landing, force, in, 1066, they, received, large, estates, there, e, g, william, s, double, second, cousin, alan, rufus, and, the, latter, s, brother, brian, of, brittany, the, bretons, helped, to, liberate, the, cornish, replacing, anglo, saxon, land, owners, some, of, these, lords, were, powerful, rivals, medieval, brittany, was, far, from, being, a, united, nation, the, french, king, maintained, envoys, in, brittany, alliances, contracted, by, local, lords, often, overlapped, and, there, was, no, specific, breton, unity, for, example, brittany, replaced, latin, with, french, as, its, official, language, in, the, 13th, century, 300, years, before, france, did, so, and, the, breton, language, did, not, have, formal, status, the, foreign, policy, of, the, duchy, changed, many, times, the, dukes, were, usually, independent, but, they, often, contracted, alliances, with, england, or, france, depending, on, who, was, threatening, them, at, that, point, their, support, for, each, nation, became, very, important, during, the, 14th, century, because, the, english, kings, had, started, to, claim, the, french, throne, the, breton, war, of, succession, a, local, episode, of, the, hundred, years, war, saw, the, house, of, blois, backed, by, the, french, fighting, with, the, house, of, montfort, backed, by, the, english, the, montforts, won, in, 1364, and, enjoyed, a, period, of, total, independence, until, the, end, of, the, hundred, years, war, because, france, was, weakened, and, stopped, sending, royal, envoys, to, the, court, of, brittany, english, diplomatic, failures, led, to, the, breton, cavalry, commanders, arthur, comte, de, richemont, later, to, become, arthur, iii, duke, of, brittany, and, his, nephew, peter, ii, duke, of, brittany, playing, key, roles, on, the, french, side, during, the, deciding, stages, of, the, war, including, the, battles, of, patay, formigny, and, castillon, and, the, treaty, of, arras, brittany, importantly, lost, the, mad, war, against, france, in, 1488, mostly, because, of, its, internal, divisions, that, were, exacerbated, by, the, corruption, at, the, court, of, francis, ii, duke, of, brittany, indeed, some, rebel, breton, lords, were, fighting, on, the, french, side, as, a, result, of, the, mad, war, the, duke, francis, ii, could, not, have, his, daughter, anne, married, without, the, king, of, france, s, consent, nonetheless, she, married, the, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1490, leading, to, a, crisis, with, france, charles, viii, of, france, besieged, rennes, and, had, the, marriage, cancelled, he, eventually, married, anne, of, brittany, after, he, died, childless, the, duchess, had, to, marry, his, heir, and, cousin, louis, xii, anne, unsuccessfully, tried, to, preserve, breton, independence, but, she, died, in, 1514, and, the, union, between, the, two, crowns, was, formally, carried, out, by, francis, i, in, 1532, he, granted, several, privileges, to, brittany, such, as, exemption, from, the, gabelle, a, tax, on, salt, that, was, very, unpopular, in, france, under, the, ancien, r, gime, brittany, and, france, were, governed, as, separate, countries, but, under, the, same, crown, so, breton, aristocrats, in, the, french, royal, court, were, classed, as, princes, trangers, foreign, princes, from, the, 15th, to, the, 18th, century, brittany, reached, an, economic, golden, age, the, region, was, located, on, the, seaways, near, spain, england, and, the, netherlands, and, it, greatly, benefited, from, the, creation, of, a, french, colonial, empire, local, seaports, like, brest, and, saint, brieuc, quickly, expanded, and, lorient, first, spelled, l, orient, was, founded, in, the, 17th, century, saint, malo, then, was, known, for, its, corsairs, brest, was, a, major, base, for, the, french, navy, and, nantes, flourished, with, the, atlantic, slave, trade, on, its, side, the, inland, provided, hemp, ropes, and, canvas, and, linen, sheets, however, colbertism, which, encouraged, the, creation, of, many, factories, did, not, favour, the, breton, industry, because, most, of, the, royal, factories, were, opened, in, other, provinces, moreover, several, conflicts, between, france, and, england, led, the, latter, to, restrain, its, trade, and, the, breton, economy, went, into, recession, during, the, 18th, century, two, significant, revolts, occurred, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, revolt, of, the, papier, timbr, 1675, and, the, pontcallec, conspiracy, 1719, both, arose, from, attempts, to, resist, centralisation, and, assert, breton, constitutional, exceptions, to, tax, many, bretons, crossed, the, atlantic, to, support, the, american, war, of, independence, these, included, many, sailors, such, as, armand, de, kersaint, and, soldiers, such, as, charles, armand, tuffin, marquis, de, la, rou, rie, the, duchy, was, legally, abolished, with, the, french, revolution, that, began, in, 1789, and, in, 1790, the, province, of, brittany, was, divided, into, five, departments, c, tes, du, nord, later, c, tes, d, armor, finist, re, ille, et, vilaine, loire, inf, rieure, later, loire, atlantique, and, morbihan, brittany, essentially, lost, all, its, special, privileges, that, existed, under, the, duchy, three, years, later, the, area, became, a, centre, of, royalist, and, catholic, resistance, to, the, revolution, during, the, chouannerie, during, the, 19th, century, brittany, remained, in, economic, recession, and, many, bretons, emigrated, to, other, french, regions, particularly, to, paris, this, trend, remained, strong, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, nonetheless, the, region, was, also, modernising, with, new, roads, and, railways, being, built, and, some, places, being, industrialised, nantes, specialised, in, shipbuilding, and, food, processing, sugar, exotic, fruits, and, vegetables, fish, foug, res, in, glass, and, shoe, production, and, metallurgy, was, practised, in, small, towns, such, as, ch, teaubriant, and, lochrist, known, for, its, labour, movements, the, region, remained, deeply, catholic, and, during, the, second, empire, the, conservative, values, were, strongly, reasserted, when, the, republic, was, re, established, in, 1871, there, were, rumours, that, breton, troops, were, mistrusted, and, mistreated, at, camp, conlie, during, the, franco, prussian, war, because, of, fears, that, they, were, a, threat, to, the, republic, during, the, 19th, century, the, breton, language, started, to, decline, precipitously, mainly, because, of, the, francization, policy, conducted, under, the, third, republic, on, one, hand, children, were, not, allowed, to, speak, breton, at, school, and, were, punished, by, teachers, if, they, did, famously, signs, in, schools, read, it, is, forbidden, to, speak, breton, and, to, spit, on, the, floor, il, est, interdit, de, parler, breton, et, de, cracher, par, terre, at, the, same, time, the, celtic, revival, led, to, the, foundation, of, the, breton, regionalist, union, urb, and, later, to, independence, movements, linked, to, irish, welsh, and, scottish, and, cornish, independence, parties, in, the, uk, and, to, pan, celticism, however, the, audience, of, these, movements, remained, very, low, and, their, ideas, did, not, reach, a, large, public, until, the, 20th, century, the, seiz, breur, movement, created, in, 1923, permitted, a, breton, artistic, revival, but, its, ties, with, nazism, and, the, collaborationism, of, the, breton, national, party, during, world, war, ii, weakened, breton, nationalism, in, the, post, war, period, brittany, lost, 240, 000, men, during, the, first, world, war, the, second, world, war, was, also, catastrophic, for, the, region, it, was, invaded, by, nazi, germany, in, 1940, and, freed, after, operation, cobra, in, august, 1944, however, the, areas, around, saint, nazaire, and, lorient, only, surrendered, on, 10, and, 11, may, 1945, several, days, after, the, german, capitulation, the, two, port, towns, had, been, virtually, destroyed, by, allied, air, raids, like, brest, and, saint, malo, and, other, towns, such, as, nantes, and, rennes, had, also, suffered, in, 1956, brittany, was, legally, reconstituted, as, the, region, of, brittany, although, the, region, excluded, the, ducal, capital, of, nantes, and, the, surrounding, area, nevertheless, brittany, retained, its, cultural, distinctiveness, and, a, new, cultural, revival, emerged, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, bilingual, schools, were, opened, singers, started, to, write, songs, in, breton, and, ecological, catastrophes, such, as, the, amoco, cadiz, oil, spill, or, the, erika, oil, spill, and, water, pollution, from, intensive, pig, farming, favoured, new, movements, to, protect, the, natural, heritage, brittany, as, a, political, entity, disappeared, in, 1790, when, it, was, divided, into, five, d, partements, the, breton, d, partements, more, or, less, correspond, to, the, nine, catholic, dioceses, that, appeared, at, the, beginning, of, the, middle, ages, they, were, often, called, pays, or, bro, country, in, french, and, breton, and, they, also, served, as, fiscal, and, military, districts, brittany, is, also, divided, between, lower, brittany, basse, bretagne, and, breizh, izel, corresponding, to, the, western, half, where, breton, is, traditionally, spoken, and, upper, brittany, haute, bretagne, and, breizh, uhel, corresponding, to, the, eastern, half, where, gallo, is, traditionally, spoken, the, historical, breton, dioceses, were, during, the, french, revolution, four, dioceses, were, suppressed, and, the, five, remaining, ones, were, modified, to, have, the, same, administrative, borders, as, the, d, partements, brittany, has, several, historical, capital, cities, when, it, was, an, independent, duchy, the, estates, of, brittany, which, can, be, compared, to, a, parliament, met, in, various, towns, dinan, plo, rmel, redon, rennes, vitr, gu, rande, and, most, of, all, vannes, where, they, met, 19, times, and, nantes, 17, times, the, court, and, the, government, were, also, very, mobile, and, each, dynasty, favoured, its, own, castles, and, estates, the, dukes, mostly, lived, in, nantes, vannes, redon, rennes, foug, res, dol, de, bretagne, dinan, and, gu, rande, all, these, towns, except, vannes, and, gu, rande, are, located, in, upper, brittany, thus, not, in, the, breton, speaking, area, among, all, these, towns, only, nantes, rennes, and, vannes, which, were, the, biggest, ones, could, really, pretend, to, the, capital, status, the, dukes, were, crowned, in, rennes, and, they, had, a, large, castle, there, it, was, however, destroyed, during, the, 15th, century, vannes, on, its, side, was, the, seat, of, the, chamber, of, accounts, and, of, the, parliament, until, the, union, with, france, the, parliament, was, then, transferred, to, rennes, and, the, chamber, of, accounts, to, nantes, nantes, nicknamed, the, city, of, the, dukes, of, brittany, was, also, the, permanent, residence, of, the, last, dukes, the, ch, teau, des, ducs, de, bretagne, still, stands, in, the, city, centre, nowadays, rennes, is, the, only, official, capital, of, the, region, of, brittany, it, is, also, the, seat, of, an, ecclesiastical, province, encompassing, brittany, and, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, during, the, french, revolution, brittany, was, divided, into, five, d, partements, each, made, up, of, three, or, four, arrondissements, the, arrondissements, are, further, divided, in, cantons, which, are, themselves, made, up, of, one, or, several, communes, the, communes, and, the, d, partements, have, a, local, council, elected, by, their, citizens, but, arrondissements, and, cantons, are, not, run, by, elected, officials, the, cantons, serve, as, an, electoral, district, for, the, election, of, the, d, partement, councils, and, arrondissements, are, run, by, a, subprefect, appointed, by, the, french, president, the, president, also, appoints, a, prefect, in, each, d, partement, because, the, d, partements, are, small, and, numerous, the, french, government, tried, to, create, wider, regions, during, the, 20th, century, for, the, breton, nationalists, it, was, an, occasion, to, recreate, brittany, as, a, political, and, administrative, entity, but, the, new, region, had, to, be, economically, efficient, nantes, and, its, d, partement, loire, atlantique, raised, concerns, because, they, were, off, centered, more, integrated, with, the, loire, valley, than, with, the, breton, peninsula, the, french, government, and, local, politicians, also, feared, that, nantes, because, of, its, population, and, its, former, breton, capital, status, would, have, maintained, a, harmful, competition, with, rennes, to, get, the, regional, institutions, and, investments, several, drafts, for, french, regions, had, been, proposed, since, the, 1920s, and, the, definitive, regions, were, drawn, in, 1956, the, new, brittany, had, four, d, partements, and, loire, atlantique, formed, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, together, with, parts, of, anjou, maine, and, poitou, in, 1972, the, regions, received, their, present, competencies, with, an, elected, regional, council, since, then, the, region, of, brittany, has, had, its, own, council, and, administrative, bodies, when, the, region, of, brittany, was, created, several, local, politicians, opposed, the, exclusion, of, loire, atlantique, and, the, question, still, remains, the, obstacles, to, reunification, are, the, same, as, in, 1956, having, nantes, in, brittany, could, harm, the, position, of, rennes, and, create, an, economic, imbalance, between, lower, and, upper, brittany, moreover, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, could, not, exist, without, loire, atlantique, because, it, would, lose, its, political, and, economic, capital, without, loire, atlantique, the, other, d, partements, would, not, form, an, efficient, region, any, more, and, would, have, to, integrate, neighbouring, regions, such, as, the, centre, val, de, loire, and, nouvelle, aquitaine, however, several, institutions, have, backed, the, reunification, such, as, the, regional, council, of, brittany, since, 2008, and, the, loire, atlantique, council, since, 2001, some, politicians, like, jean, marc, ayrault, the, former, french, prime, minister, and, former, mayor, of, nantes, favour, instead, the, creation, of, a, greater, west, region, which, would, encompass, brittany, and, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, polls, show, that, 58, of, the, bretons, and, 62, of, the, inhabitants, in, loire, atlantique, favour, the, reunification, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, brittany, had, been, characterised, by, a, strong, catholic, and, conservative, influence, however, some, areas, such, as, the, industrial, region, around, saint, nazaire, and, lorient, and, the, surroundings, of, tr, guier, are, traditional, socialist, and, communist, strongholds, left, wing, parties, mainly, the, socialist, party, and, the, greens, have, become, more, powerful, after, the, 1970s, and, they, have, formed, a, majority, in, the, regional, council, of, brittany, since, 2004, the, loire, atlantique, and, ille, et, vilaine, councils, have, also, been, held, by, the, left, since, 2004, the, socialist, party, has, held, the, c, tes, d, armor, council, since, 1976, and, the, finist, re, council, since, 1998, on, its, side, morbihan, remains, a, right, wing, stronghold, the, local, parties, have, a, very, small, audience, except, the, union, d, mocratique, bretonne, which, has, seats, at, the, regional, council, and, in, other, local, assemblies, it, advocates, more, autonomy, for, the, region, and, its, positions, are, very, close, to, the, socialist, parties, it, also, has, a, strong, ecological, orientation, the, audience, of, far, right, parties, is, lower, in, brittany, than, in, the, rest, of, france, brittany, is, the, largest, french, peninsula, it, is, around, 34, 030, km, 2, 13, 140, sq, mi, and, stretches, toward, the, northwest, and, the, atlantic, ocean, it, is, bordered, to, the, north, by, the, english, channel, to, the, south, by, the, bay, of, biscay, and, the, waters, located, between, the, western, coast, and, ushant, island, form, the, iroise, sea, the, breton, coast, is, very, indented, with, many, cliffs, rias, and, capes, the, gulf, of, morbihan, is, a, vast, natural, harbour, with, some, forty, islands, that, is, almost, a, closed, sea, in, total, around, 800, islands, lie, off, the, mainland, the, largest, being, belle, le, in, the, south, brittany, has, over, 2, 860, km, 1, 780, mi, of, coastline, it, represents, a, third, of, the, total, french, coastline, the, region, is, generally, hilly, because, it, corresponds, to, the, western, end, of, the, armorican, massif, a, very, old, range, that, also, extends, in, normandy, and, the, pays, de, la, loire, region, because, of, this, continuity, the, breton, border, with, the, rest, of, france, is, not, marked, by, any, strong, geographical, landmark, apart, from, the, river, couesnon, which, separates, brittany, from, normandy, the, armorican, massif, reaches, its, maximum, elevation, outside, of, brittany, in, neighbouring, mayenne, at, 417, m, and, slopes, towards, the, west, before, straightening, on, its, western, extremity, with, the, montagnes, noires, and, the, monts, d, arr, e, the, highest, hill, in, brittany, is, the, roc, h, ruz, in, the, monts, d, arr, e, at, 385, m, 1, 263, ft, it, is, closely, followed, by, several, neighbouring, hills, culminating, at, around, 384, m, above, sea, level, coastal, areas, are, usually, named, armor, or, arvor, by, the, sea, in, breton, and, the, inland, is, called, argoat, by, the, forest, the, best, soils, were, primitively, covered, by, large, forests, which, had, been, progressively, replaced, by, bocage, during, the, middle, ages, the, breton, bocage, with, its, small, fields, enclosed, by, thick, hedgerows, has, almost, disappeared, since, the, 1960s, to, fit, the, modern, agricultural, needs, and, methods, particularly, mechanisation, several, forests, still, exist, such, as, the, paimpont, forest, sometimes, said, to, be, the, arthurian, broc, liande, the, poor, and, rocky, areas, are, covered, by, large, heathland, and, moorlands, and, brittany, has, several, marshes, like, the, bri, re, included, in, a, regional, natural, park, another, regional, park, encompasses, the, monts, d, arr, e, and, the, iroise, seacoast, the, iroise, sea, is, also, a, unesco, biosphere, reserve, the, breton, peninsula, appeared, during, the, cadomian, orogeny, which, formed, its, northern, coastline, between, guingamp, and, foug, res, the, southern, part, emerged, during, the, hercynian, orogeny, at, the, same, time, an, intense, volcanic, activity, left, large, quantities, of, granite, between, the, cadomian, and, hercynian, periods, the, region, was, submerged, several, times, and, the, sea, left, fossils, and, sedimentary, rocks, mostly, schist, and, sandstone, because, of, the, absence, of, limestone, soils, in, brittany, are, usually, acid, the, armorican, massif, straightened, and, flattened, several, times, during, the, formation, of, the, pyrenees, and, the, alps, changes, in, sea, levels, and, climate, led, to, a, strong, erosion, and, to, the, formation, of, more, sedimentary, rocks, metamorphism, is, responsible, for, the, distinctive, local, blue, schist, and, for, the, rich, subsoil, of, the, groix, island, which, comprises, glaucophane, and, epidote, during, the, quaternary, glaciations, brittany, was, covered, by, loess, and, rivers, started, to, fill, the, valleys, with, alluvial, deposits, the, valleys, themselves, were, a, result, of, a, strong, tectonic, activity, between, the, african, and, the, eurasian, plate, the, present, breton, landscape, did, not, acquire, its, final, shape, before, one, million, years, ago, the, breton, subsoil, is, characterised, by, a, huge, amount, of, fractures, that, form, a, large, aquifer, containing, several, millions, square, meters, of, water, brittany, lies, within, the, north, temperate, zone, it, has, a, changeable, maritime, climate, similar, to, cornwall, rainfall, occurs, regularly, but, sunny, cloudless, days, are, also, common, in, the, summer, months, temperatures, in, the, region, can, reach, 30, c, 86, f, yet, the, climate, remains, comfortable, especially, when, compared, to, the, french, regions, located, south, of, the, loire, the, temperature, difference, between, summer, and, winter, is, about, 15, degrees, but, it, varies, depending, on, the, proximity, of, the, sea, the, weather, is, generally, milder, on, the, seacoast, than, inland, but, rainfall, occurs, with, the, same, intensity, on, both, the, monts, d, arr, e, despite, their, low, elevation, have, much, more, rainfall, than, the, rest, of, the, region, the, south, coast, between, lorient, and, pornic, enjoys, more, than, 2, 000, hours, of, sunshine, per, year, brittany, s, wildlife, is, typical, of, france, with, several, distinctions, on, one, hand, the, region, due, to, its, long, coastline, has, a, rich, oceanic, fauna, and, some, birds, cannot, be, seen, in, other, french, regions, on, the, other, hand, the, species, found, in, the, inland, are, usually, common, for, france, and, because, brittany, is, a, peninsula, the, number, of, species, is, lower, in, its, western, extremity, than, in, the, eastern, part, a, variety, of, seabirds, can, be, seen, close, to, the, seaside, which, is, home, to, colonies, of, cormorants, gulls, razorbills, northern, gannets, common, murres, and, atlantic, puffins, most, of, these, birds, breed, on, isolated, islands, and, rocks, and, thus, are, hard, to, observe, the, inland, is, home, to, common, european, species, including, pheasants, barn, swallows, woodcocks, common, swifts, and, partridges, like, cornwall, wales, and, ireland, the, waters, of, brittany, attract, marine, animals, including, basking, sharks, grey, seals, leatherback, turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs, and, lobsters, bass, is, common, along, the, coast, small, spotted, catsharks, live, on, the, continental, shelf, rattails, and, anglerfish, populate, the, deep, waters, river, fish, of, note, include, trout, atlantic, salmon, pikes, shades, and, lampreys, the, breton, rivers, are, also, home, to, beavers, and, otters, and, to, some, invasive, american, species, such, as, the, coypu, which, destroys, the, ecosystem, and, accelerated, the, extinction, of, the, european, mink, among, the, invertebrates, brittany, is, notably, home, to, the, escargot, de, quimper, the, freshwater, pearl, mussel, and, the, white, clawed, crayfish, the, larger, breton, mammals, died, out, during, the, modern, period, including, the, wolf, today, mammals, of, note, include, roe, deer, wild, boar, foxes, hares, and, several, species, of, bat, brittany, is, widely, known, for, the, breton, horse, a, local, breed, of, draft, horse, and, for, the, brittany, gun, dog, the, region, also, has, its, own, breeds, of, cattle, some, of, which, are, on, the, brink, of, extinction, the, bretonne, pie, noir, the, froment, du, l, on, the, armorican, and, the, nantaise, the, breton, forests, dunes, moorlands, and, marshes, are, home, to, several, iconic, plants, such, as, endemic, cistus, aster, and, linaria, varieties, the, horseshoe, vetch, and, the, lotus, maritimus, brittany, has, the, same, education, system, as, the, rest, of, france, as, in, other, french, regions, formal, education, before, the, 19th, century, was, the, preserve, of, the, elite, before, 1460, brittany, did, not, have, a, university, and, breton, students, had, to, go, to, angers, poitiers, or, caen, the, university, of, nantes, was, founded, under, the, duke, francis, ii, who, wanted, to, affirm, the, breton, independence, from, france, all, the, traditional, disciplines, were, taught, here, arts, theology, law, and, medicine, during, the, 17th, century, it, had, around, 1, 500, students, it, declined, during, the, 18th, century, mostly, because, nantes, was, flourishing, with, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, paid, no, attention, to, its, cultural, institutions, a, mayor, eventually, asked, the, university, to, be, relocated, to, rennes, more, devoted, to, culture, and, science, and, the, faculties, progressively, moved, there, after, 1735, the, transfer, was, interrupted, by, the, french, revolution, and, all, the, french, universities, were, dissolved, in, 1793, napoleon, reorganised, the, french, education, system, in, 1808, he, created, new, universities, and, invented, two, secondary, education, institutions, the, coll, ges, and, the, lyc, es, which, were, opened, in, numerous, towns, to, educate, boys, and, form, a, new, elite, a, new, university, of, rennes, was, progressively, recreated, during, the, 19th, century, in, the, meantime, several, laws, were, promoted, to, open, schools, notably, for, girls, in, 1882, jules, ferry, succeeded, in, passing, a, law, which, made, primary, education, in, france, free, non, clerical, la, que, and, mandatory, thus, free, schools, were, opened, in, almost, every, villages, of, brittany, jules, ferry, also, promoted, education, policies, establishing, french, language, as, the, language, of, the, republic, and, mandatory, education, was, a, mean, to, eradicate, regional, languages, and, dialects, in, brittany, it, was, forbidden, for, the, pupils, to, speak, breton, or, gallo, and, the, two, were, strongly, depreciated, humiliating, practices, aimed, at, stamping, out, the, breton, language, and, culture, prevailed, in, state, schools, until, the, late, 1960s, in, response, the, diwan, schools, were, founded, in, 1977, to, teach, breton, by, immersion, they, have, taught, a, few, thousand, young, people, from, elementary, school, to, high, school, and, they, have, gained, more, fame, owing, to, their, high, level, of, results, in, school, exams, a, bilingual, approach, has, also, been, implemented, in, some, state, schools, after, 1979, and, some, catholic, schools, have, done, the, same, after, 1990, besides, brittany, with, the, neighbouring, pays, de, la, loire, region, remains, a, stronghold, for, catholic, private, education, with, around, 1, 400, schools, during, the, 20th, century, tertiary, education, was, developed, with, the, creation, of, the, cole, centrale, de, nantes, in, 1919, the, university, of, nantes, in, 1961, the, esc, bretagne, brest, in, 1962, the, university, of, western, brittany, in, 1971, the, cole, nationale, sup, rieure, des, t, l, communications, de, bretagne, in, 1977, and, the, university, of, southern, brittany, in, 1995, the, catholic, university, of, the, west, based, in, angers, also, opened, classes, in, several, breton, towns, in, 1969, the, university, of, rennes, was, divided, between, the, university, of, rennes, 1, and, the, university, of, rennes, 2, upper, brittany, after, the, second, world, war, the, ecole, sp, ciale, militaire, de, saint, cyr, the, foremost, french, military, academy, settled, in, co, tquidan, brittany, apart, from, some, areas, such, as, lorient, nantes, and, saint, nazaire, has, never, been, heavily, industrialised, today, fishing, and, agriculture, remain, important, activities, brittany, has, more, than, 40, 000, farms, mostly, oriented, towards, cattle, pig, and, poultry, breeding, as, well, as, cereal, and, vegetable, production, the, number, of, farms, tends, to, diminish, but, as, a, result, they, are, merged, into, very, large, estates, brittany, is, the, first, producer, in, france, for, vegetables, green, beans, onions, artichokes, potatoes, tomatoes, cereals, are, mostly, grown, for, cattle, feeding, wine, especially, muscadet, is, made, in, a, small, region, south, of, nantes, brittany, is, the, first, region, in, france, for, fishing, the, activity, employs, around, 15, 000, people, and, more, than, 2500, firms, work, in, fish, and, seafood, processing, although, relatively, new, the, breton, industry, has, been, constantly, growing, since, 1980, food, processing, meat, vegetables, represents, a, third, of, the, industrial, jobs, but, other, activities, are, also, important, for, the, local, economy, shipbuilding, both, commercial, and, military, is, implanted, in, saint, nazaire, chantiers, de, l, atlantique, lorient, and, brest, airbus, has, plants, in, saint, nazaire, and, nantes, and, peugeot, has, a, large, factory, in, rennes, brittany, is, the, second, french, region, for, telecommunication, and, the, fifth, for, electronics, two, activities, mainly, developed, in, rennes, lannion, and, brest, the, unemployment, rate, in, brittany, is, lower, than, in, other, french, regions, and, it, is, usually, around, 6, or, 7, of, the, active, population, because, of, the, global, financial, crisis, started, in, 2007, unemployment, rose, to, 8, 7, in, the, region, brittany, and, 8, 4, in, loire, atlantique, in, late, 2012, however, these, figures, remain, under, the, french, national, rate, 9, 9, at, the, same, period, some, industries, such, as, construction, industry, catering, or, transport, usually, have, difficulties, finding, employees, in, 2018, region, brittany, s, gross, domestic, product, reached, 99, billion, euros, it, was, the, ninth, richest, region, in, france, and, it, produced, 4, of, the, national, gdp, the, breton, gdp, per, capita, was, around, 29, 694, euros, in, 2018, it, was, lower, than, the, french, result, 30, 266, euros, below, the, european, one, 30, 900, euros, the, gdp, of, the, loire, atlantique, d, partement, is, around, 26, billion, euros, and, the, gdp, of, the, five, historical, breton, d, partements, would, be, at, around, 108, billion, euros, tourism, is, particularly, important, for, the, seacoast, and, brittany, is, one, of, the, most, visited, regions, in, france, in, april, 2019, the, guardian, s, travel, section, included, two, brittany, locations, in, its, list, of, 20, of, the, most, beautiful, villages, in, france, the, two, were, rochefort, en, terre, with, its, covered, market, 12th, century, church, medieval, castle, 19th, century, chateau, and, 16th, and, 17th, century, mansions, and, locronan, where, east, india, company, s, offices, still, stand, on, the, village, square, as, well, as, 17th, century, merchants, dwellings, in, 2017, the, population, in, region, brittany, was, estimated, to, 3, 318, 904, and, loire, atlantique, had, around, 1, 394, 909, inhabitants, thus, historical, brittany, s, population, can, be, estimated, at, 4, 713, 813, the, highest, in, its, history, the, population, in, region, brittany, had, grown, by, 0, 9, between, 1999, and, 2000, and, the, growth, rate, reached, more, than, 1, in, ille, et, vilaine, and, morbihan, the, region, around, rennes, and, the, south, are, the, more, attractive, areas, whereas, the, population, is, declining, in, the, centre, and, in, the, westernmost, parts, while, most, of, the, metropolitan, areas, are, growing, the, cities, themselves, tend, to, stagnate, or, regress, such, as, for, brest, lorient, saint, brieuc, and, saint, malo, in, 2017, ille, et, vilaine, had, 1, 060, 199, inhabitants, it, was, followed, by, finist, re, 909, 028, inhabitants, morbihan, 750, 863, inhabitants, and, c, tes, d, armor, with, 598, 814, inhabitants, the, largest, cities, in, region, brittany, as, of, 2017, were, rennes, with, 216, 815, inhabitants, brest, 140, 064, quimper, 62, 985, lorient, 57, 149, vannes, 53, 352, saint, malo, 46, 097, and, saint, brieuc, 44, 372, all, the, other, communes, had, under, 25, 000, inhabitants, brittany, is, also, characterised, by, a, great, number, of, small, towns, such, as, vitr, concarneau, morlaix, or, auray, loire, atlantique, has, two, major, cities, nantes, with, 309, 346, inhabitants, and, an, urban, area, encompassing, 972, 828, and, saint, nazaire, with, 69, 993, inhabitants, loire, atlantique, s, population, is, more, rapidly, growing, than, region, brittany, s, and, it, is, the, 12th, most, populated, french, d, partement, nevertheless, since, the, 1990s, rennes, has, consistently, ranked, as, one, of, france, s, fastest, growing, metropolitan, areas, in, 1851, brittany, had, around, 2, 7, million, inhabitants, and, the, demographic, growth, stayed, low, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, mainly, because, of, an, important, emigration, brittany, had, 3, 2, million, inhabitants, in, 1962, and, the, growth, was, mainly, due, to, loire, atlantique, and, the, steady, growth, of, nantes, without, the, loire, atlantique, s, figures, the, breton, population, only, numbered, 2, 4, million, in, 1962, nearly, unchanged, from, its, population, of, 2, 3, million, in, 1851, after, the, 1960s, the, whole, region, has, had, a, strong, demographic, growth, because, of, the, decline, of, the, traditional, emigration, to, richer, french, regions, instead, brittany, has, become, attractive, particularly, for, families, young, retired,

for, whom, it, is, usually, their, mother, tongue, however, french, was, not, widely, known, in, the, region, before, the, 19th, century, and, two, regional, languages, exist, in, brittany, breton, and, gallo, they, are, separated, by, a, language, border, that, has, constantly, moved, back, since, the, middle, ages, the, current, border, runs, from, plouha, on, the, english, channel, to, the, rhuys, peninsula, on, the, bay, of, biscay, because, of, their, origins, and, practice, breton, and, gallo, can, be, compared, to, scottish, gaelic, and, scots, language, in, scotland, both, have, been, recognised, as, langues, de, bretagne, languages, of, brittany, by, the, regional, council, of, brittany, since, 2004, breton, is, a, celtic, language, derived, from, the, historical, common, brittonic, language, and, is, most, closely, related, to, cornish, and, welsh, it, was, imported, to, western, armorica, during, the, 5th, century, by, britons, fleeing, the, anglo, saxon, invasion, of, britain, breton, remained, the, language, of, the, rural, population, but, since, the, middle, ages, the, bourgeoisie, the, nobility, and, the, higher, clergy, have, spoken, french, government, policies, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, made, education, compulsory, and, at, the, same, time, forbade, the, use, of, breton, in, schools, to, push, non, french, speakers, into, adopting, the, french, language, nevertheless, until, the, 1960s, breton, was, spoken, or, understood, by, many, of, the, inhabitants, of, western, brittany, during, the, 1970s, breton, schools, were, opened, and, the, local, authorities, started, to, promote, the, language, which, was, on, the, brink, of, extinction, because, parents, had, stopped, teaching, it, to, their, children, having, declined, from, more, than, one, million, speakers, around, 1950, to, about, 200, 000, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, of, whom, 61, are, more, than, 60, years, old, breton, is, classified, as, severely, endangered, by, the, unesco, atlas, of, the, world, s, languages, in, danger, however, the, number, of, children, attending, bilingual, classes, has, risen, 33, between, 2006, and, 2012, to, 14, 709, the, breton, language, has, several, dialects, which, have, no, precise, limits, but, rather, form, a, continuum, most, of, them, are, very, similar, to, each, other, with, only, some, phonetic, and, lexical, differences, the, three, main, dialects, spoken, in, the, western, end, of, brittany, are, in, opposition, to, the, vannetais, spoken, around, vannes, which, is, the, most, differentiated, breton, dialect, according, to, a, 1999, insee, survey, 12, of, the, adults, of, brittany, speak, breton, gallo, is, spoken, on, the, eastern, half, of, brittany, it, is, not, itself, a, celtic, language, like, french, it, is, also, descended, from, latin, and, is, classified, in, the, langues, d, o, l, branch, but, has, some, celtic, influences, particularly, in, its, vocabulary, whereas, french, has, influences, from, both, celtic, gaulish, and, frankish, the, germanic, language, which, arrived, after, latin, in, much, of, the, rest, of, france, unlike, breton, gallo, does, not, have, a, long, promotion, history, and, it, is, still, often, perceived, as, a, poor, rural, dialect, moreover, because, of, its, linguistic, relationship, with, gallo, french, imposed, itself, more, easily, as, the, main, language, in, upper, brittany, than, in, breton, speaking, areas, gallo, was, simply, perceived, as, an, incorrect, way, of, speaking, french, rather, than, a, separate, language, gallo, transmission, from, parents, to, children, is, extremely, low, and, efforts, to, standardise, and, publish, books, in, gallo, did, not, reverse, the, decline, of, the, language, and, its, lack, of, prestige, gallo, is, also, threatened, by, the, breton, language, revival, because, breton, is, gaining, ground, in, territories, that, were, not, previously, part, of, the, main, breton, speaking, area, and, most, of, all, because, breton, appears, as, the, national, language, of, brittany, thus, leaving, no, place, for, gallo, gallo, had, never, been, written, before, the, 20th, century, and, several, writing, systems, were, created, they, are, however, rarely, known, by, the, population, and, signs, in, gallo, are, often, unreadable, even, for, fluent, speakers, in, loire, atlantique, where, gallo, is, not, promoted, at, all, by, the, local, authorities, many, people, do, not, even, know, the, word, gallo, and, have, no, idea, that, it, has, writing, systems, and, publications, the, gallo, community, is, estimated, at, between, 28, 300, and, 200, 000, speakers, the, language, is, taught, on, a, non, compulsory, basis, in, some, schools, high, schools, and, universities, particularly, in, ille, et, vilaine, bretons, are, mainly, catholic, and, the, christianisation, occurred, during, the, roman, gaul, and, frank, era, during, the, briton, emigration, to, brittany, several, christian, missionaries, mostly, welsh, came, in, the, region, and, founded, dioceses, they, are, known, as, the, seven, founder, saints, other, notable, early, missionaries, are, gildas, and, the, irish, saint, columbanus, bretons, recognize, more, than, 300, local, saints, though, only, a, few, are, officially, accepted, by, the, catholic, church, since, the, 19th, century, at, least, brittany, has, been, known, as, one, of, the, most, devoutly, catholic, regions, in, france, together, with, the, neighbouring, pays, de, la, loire, region, the, proportion, of, students, attending, catholic, private, schools, is, the, highest, in, france, the, patron, saint, of, brittany, is, saint, anne, the, virgin, s, mother, but, ivo, of, kermartin, a, 13th, century, priest, called, saint, yves, in, french, and, sant, erwan, in, breton, can, also, be, considered, as, a, patron, saint, his, feast, 19, may, is, brittany, s, national, day, many, distinctive, traditions, and, customs, have, also, been, preserved, in, brittany, among, them, the, pardons, are, one, of, the, most, traditional, demonstrations, of, popular, catholicism, these, penitential, ceremonies, occur, in, some, villages, in, lower, brittany, on, the, feast, day, of, the, parish, s, saint, the, penitents, form, a, procession, and, they, walk, together, to, a, shrine, a, church, or, any, sacred, place, some, pardons, are, reputed, for, their, length, and, they, all, finish, by, large, meals, and, popular, feasts, there, is, a, very, old, pilgrimage, called, the, tro, breizh, tour, of, brittany, where, the, pilgrims, walk, around, brittany, from, the, grave, of, one, of, the, seven, founder, saints, to, another, historically, the, pilgrimage, was, made, in, one, trip, a, total, distance, of, around, 600, km, for, all, seven, saints, nowadays, however, pilgrims, complete, the, circuit, over, the, course, of, several, years, in, 2002, the, tro, breizh, included, a, special, pilgrimage, to, wales, symbolically, making, the, reverse, journey, of, the, welshmen, sant, paol, sant, brieg, and, sant, samzun, the, most, powerful, folk, figure, is, the, ankou, or, the, reaper, of, death, sometimes, a, skeleton, wrapped, in, a, shroud, with, the, breton, flat, hat, sometimes, described, as, a, real, human, being, the, last, dead, of, the, year, devoted, to, bring, the, dead, to, death, he, makes, his, journeys, by, night, carrying, an, upturned, scythe, which, he, throws, before, him, to, reap, his, harvest, sometimes, he, is, on, foot, but, mostly, he, travels, with, a, cart, the, karrig, an, ankou, drawn, by, two, oxen, and, a, lean, horse, two, servants, dressed, in, the, same, shroud, and, hat, as, the, ankou, pile, the, dead, into, the, cart, and, to, hear, it, creaking, at, night, means, you, have, little, time, left, to, live, as, official, religious, statistics, are, forbidden, in, france, there, are, no, official, figures, about, religious, practices, in, brittany, however, successive, polls, show, that, the, region, has, grown, more, nonreligious, over, time, catholicism, started, to, decline, after, the, second, world, war, during, the, urbanisation, of, brittany, a, poll, conducted, in, 2006, showed, that, morbihan, was, the, only, d, partement, to, have, a, strong, catholic, population, around, 70, of, its, inhabitants, belonging, to, that, religion, loire, atlantique, and, c, tes, d, armor, were, among, the, least, catholic, french, d, partements, with, only, 50, of, the, population, practicing, catholics, while, ille, et,
