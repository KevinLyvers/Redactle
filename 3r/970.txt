dynasty, and, founder, of, the, city, of, yervandashat, however, it, is, likely, that, the, city, s, name, is, derived, from, the, urartian, military, fortress, of, erebuni, which, was, founded, on, the, territory, of, modern, day, yerevan, in, 782, bc, by, argishti, i, erebuni, may, derive, from, the, urartian, word, for, to, take, or, to, capture, meaning, that, the, fortress, s, name, could, be, interpreted, as, capture, conquest, or, victory, as, elements, of, the, urartian, language, blended, with, that, of, the, armenian, one, the, name, eventually, evolved, into, yerevan, erebuni, erevani, erevan, yerevan, scholar, margarit, israelyan, notes, these, changes, when, comparing, inscriptions, found, on, two, cuneiform, tablets, at, erebuni, the, transcription, of, the, second,

inscription, read, er, bu, ni, therefore, the, prominent, armenianologist, orientalist, prof, g, a, ghapantsian, justly, objected, remarking, that, the, urartu, b, changed, to, v, at, the, beginning, of, the, word, biani, van, or, between, two, vowels, ebani, avan, zabaha, javakhk, in, other, words, b, was, placed, between, two, vowels, the, true, pronunciation, of, the, fortress, city, was, apparently, erebuny, early, christian, armenian, chroniclers, connected, the, origin, of, the, city, s, name, to, the, legend, of, noah, s, ark, after, the, ark, had, landed, on, mount, ararat, and,

armenia, came, under, the, rule, of, sasanian, persia, the, armenian, territories, formed, the, province, of, persian, armenia, within, the, sasanian, empire, due, to, the, diminished, role, of, erebuni, as, well, as, the, absence, of, proper, historical, data, much, of, the, city, s, history, under, the, sasanian, rule, is, unknown, in, 587, during, the, reign, of, emperor, maurice, yerevan,

the, bagratuni, dynasty, of, armenia, between, 885, and, 1045, yerevan, was, relatively, a, secure, part, of, the, kingdom, before, falling, to, the, byzantines, however, yerevan, did, not, have, any, strategic, role, during, the, reign, of, the, bagratids, who, developed, many, other, cities, of, ayrarat, such, as, shirakavan, dvin, and, ani, after, a, brief, byzantine, rule, over, armenia, between, 1045, and, 1064, the, invading, seljuks, led, by, tughril, and, later, by, his, successor, alp, arslan, ruled, over, the, entire, region, including, yerevan, however, with, the, establishment, of, the, zakarid, principality, of, armenia, in, 1201, under, the, georgian, protectorate, the, armenian, territories, of, yerevan, and, lori, had, significantly, grown, after, the, mongols, captured, ani, in, 1236, armenia, turned, into, a, mongol, protectorate, as, part, of, the, ilkhanate, and, the, zakarids, became, vassals, to, the, mongols, after, the, fall, of, the, ilkhanate, in, the, mid, 14th, century, the, zakarid, princes, ruled, over, lori, shirak, and, the, ararat, plain, until, 1360, when, they, fell, to, the, invading, turkic, tribes, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 14th, century, the, aq, qoyunlu, sunni, oghuz, turkic, tribe, took, over, armenia, including, yerevan, in, 1400, timur, invaded, armenia, and, georgia, and, captured, more, than, 60, 000, of, the, survived, local, people, as, slaves, many, districts, including, yerevan, were, depopulated, in, 1410, armenia, fell, under, the, control, of, the, kara, koyunlu, shia, oghuz, turkic, tribe, according, to, the, armenian, historian, thomas, of, metsoph, although, the, kara, koyunlu, levied, heavy, taxes, against, the, armenians, the, early, years, of, their, rule, were, relatively, peaceful, and, some, reconstruction, of, towns, took, place, the, kara, koyunlus, made, yerevan, the, centre, of, the, newly, formed, chukhur, saad, administrative, territory, the, territory, was, named, after, a, turkic, leader, known, as, emir, saad, however, this, peaceful, period, was, shattered, with, the, rise, of, qara, iskander, between, 1420, and, 1436, who, reportedly, made, armenia, a, desert, and, subjected, it, to, devastation, and, plunder, to, slaughter, and, captivity, the, wars, of, iskander, and, his, eventual, defeat, against, the, timurids, invited, further, destruction, in, armenia, as, many, more, armenians, were, taken, captive, and, sold, into, slavery, and, the, land, was, subjected, to, outright, pillaging, forcing, many, of, them, to, leave, the, region, following, the, fall, of, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, in, 1375, the, seat, of, the, armenian, church, was, transferred, from, sis, back, to, vagharshapat, near, yerevan, in, 1441, thus, yerevan, became, the, main, economic, cultural, and, administrative, centre, in, armenia, in, 1501, 02, most, of, the, eastern, armenian, territories, including, yerevan, were, swiftly, conquered, by, the, emerging, safavid, dynasty, of, iran, led, by, shah, ismail, i, soon, after, in, 1502, yerevan, became, the, centre, of, the, erivan, province, a, new, administrative, territory, of, iran, formed, by, the, safavids, for, the, following, 3, centuries, it, remained, with, brief, intermissions, under, the, iranian, rule, due, to, its, strategic, significance, yerevan, was, initially, often, fought, over, and, passed, back, and, forth, between, the, dominion, of, the, rivaling, iranian, and, ottoman, empire, until, it, permanently, became, controlled, by, the, safavids, in, 1555, iran, had, secured, its, legitimate, possession, over, yerevan, with, the, ottomans, through, the, treaty, of, amasya, in, 1582, 1583, the, ottomans, led, by, serdar, ferhad, pasha, took, brief, control, over, yerevan, ferhad, pasha, managed, to, build, the, erivan, fortress, on, the, ruins, of, one, thousand, years, old, ancient, armenian, fortress, on, the, shores, of, hrazdan, river, however, ottoman, control, ended, in, 1604, when, the, persians, regained, yerevan, as, a, result, of, first, ottoman, safavid, war, shah, abbas, i, of, persia, who, ruled, between, 1588, and, 1629, ordered, the, deportation, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, armenians, including, citizens, from, yerevan, to, mainland, persia, as, a, consequence, yerevan, significantly, lost, its, armenian, population, who, had, declined, to, 20, while, muslims, including, persians, turks, kurds, and, tatars, gained, dominance, with, around, 80, of, the, city, s, population, muslims, were, either, sedentary, semi, sedentary, or, nomadic, armenians, mainly, occupied, the, kond, neighbourhood, of, yerevan, and, the, rural, suburbs, around, the, city, however, the, armenians, dominated, over,

of, the, newly, formed, administrative, territory, of, erivan, khanate, under, the, afsharid, dynasty, of, iran, which, encompassed, an, area, of, 15, 000, square, kilometres, 5, 800, square, miles,
