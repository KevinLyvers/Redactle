form, of, m, li, honey, or, any, similarly, sweet, thing, and, the, suffix, the, ancient, greeks, may, have, given, the, island, this, name, after, malta, s, endemic, subspecies, of, bees, alternatively, other, scholars, argue, for, derivation, of, the, greek, name, from, an, original, phoenician, or, punic, maleth, ml, meaning, haven, or, port, in, reference, to, the, grand, harbour, and, its, primary, settlement, at, cospicua, following, the, sea, level, rise, that, separated, the, maltese, islands, and, flooded, its, original, coastal, settlements, in, the, 10th, century, bc, the, name, was, then, applied, to, all, of, malta, by, the, greeks, and, to, its, ancient, capital, at, mdina, by, the, romans, malta, and, its, demonym, maltese, are, attested, in, english, from, the, late, 16th, century, the, greek, name, appears, in, the, book, of, acts, in, the, bible, s, new, testament, english, translations, including, the, 1611, king, james, version, long, used, the, vulgate, latin, form, melita, although, william, tyndale, s, 1525, translation, from, greek, sources, used, the, transliteration, melite, instead, malta, is, widely, used, in, more, recent, versions, the, name, is, attested, earlier, in, other, languages, however, including, some, medieval, manuscripts, of, the, latin, antonine, itinerary, malta, has, been, inhabited, from, circa, 5900, bc, since, the, arrival, of, settlers, originating, from, european, neolithic, agriculturalists, pottery, found, by, archaeologists, at, the, skorba, temples, resembles, that, found, in, italy, and, suggests, that, the, maltese, islands, were, first, settled, in, 5200, bc, by, stone, age, hunters, or, farmers, who, had, arrived, from, sicily, possibly, the, sicani, the, extinction, of, the, dwarf, hippos, giant, swans, and, dwarf, elephants, has, been, linked, to, the, earliest, arrival, of, humans, on, malta, prehistoric, farming, settlements, dating, to, the, early, neolithic, include, g, ar, dalam, the, population, on, malta, grew, cereals, raised, livestock, and, in, common, with, other, ancient, mediterranean, cultures, worshipped, a, fertility, figure, a, culture, of, megalithic, temple, builders, then, either, supplanted, or, arose, from, this, early, period, around, 3500, bc, these, people, built, some, of, the, oldest, existing, free, standing, structures, in, the, world, in, the, form, of, the, megalithic, gantija, temples, on, gozo, other, early, temples, include, those, at, a, ar, qim, and, mnajdra, the, temples, have, distinctive, architecture, typically, a, complex, trefoil, design, and, were, used, from, 4000, to, 2500, bc, tentative, information, suggests, that, animal, sacrifices, were, made, to, the, goddess, of, fertility, whose, statue, is, now, in, the, national, museum, of, archaeology, in, valletta, another, archaeological, feature, of, the, maltese, islands, often, attributed, to, these, ancient, builders, is, equidistant, uniform, grooves, dubbed, cart, tracks, or, cart, ruts, which, can, be, found, in, several, locations, throughout, the, islands, with, the, most, prominent, being, those, found, in, misra, g, ar, il, kbir, these, may, have, been, caused, by, wooden, wheeled, carts, eroding, soft, limestone, the, culture, apparently, disappeared, from, the, islands, around, 2500, bc, possibly, due, to, famine, or, disease, after, 2500, bc, the, maltese, islands, were, depopulated, for, several, decades, until, an, influx, of, bronze, age, immigrants, a, culture, that, cremated, its, dead, and, introduced, smaller, megalithic, structures, called, dolmens, they, are, claimed, to, belong, to, a, population, certainly, different, from, that, which, built, the, previous, megalithic, temples, it, is, presumed, the, population, arrived, from, sicily, because, of, the, similarity, of, maltese, dolmens, to, some, small, constructions, found, there, phoenician, traders, colonised, the, islands, under, the, name, ann, nn, sometime, after, 1000, bc, as, a, stop, on, their, trade, routes, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, cornwall, their, seat, of, government, was, apparently, at, mdina, which, shared, the, island, s, name, the, primary, port, was, at, cospicua, on, the, grand, harbour, which, they, called, maleth, after, the, fall, of, phoenicia, in, 332, bc, the, area, came, under, the, control, of, carthage,

marcus, atilius, regulus, after, the, failure, of, his, expedition, the, island, fell, back, in, the, hands, of, carthage, only, to, be, conquered, again, during, the, second, punic, war, in, 218, bc, by, the, roman, consul, tiberius, sempronius, longus, after, that, malta, became, a, foederata, civitas, a, designation, that, meant, it, was, exempt, from, paying, tribute, or, the, rule, of, roman, law, and, fell, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, province, of, sicily, its, capital, at, mdina, was, renamed, melita, after, the, greek, and, roman, name, for, the, island, punic, influence,

greek, garrison, while, the, bulk, of, population, continued, to, be, constituted, by, the, old, latinized, dwellers, during, this, period, its, religious, allegiance, oscillated, between, the, pope, and, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, the, byzantine, rule, introduced, greek, families, to, the, maltese, collective, malta, remained, under, the, byzantine, empire, until, 870, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, arabs, malta, became, involved, in, the, arab, byzantine, wars, and, the, conquest, of, malta, is, closely, linked, with, that, of, sicily, that, began, in, 827, after, admiral, euphemius, betrayal, of, his, fellow, byzantines, requesting, that, the, aghlabids, invade, the, island, the, muslim, chronicler, and, geographer, al, himyari, recounts, that, in, 870, following, a, violent, struggle, against, the, defending, byzantines, the, arab, invaders, first, led, by, halaf, al, hadim, and, later, by, sawada, ibn, muhammad, pillaged, the, island, destroying, the, most, important, buildings, and, leaving, it, practically, uninhabited, until, it, was, recolonised, by, the, arabs, from, sicily, in, 1048, 1049, it, is, uncertain, whether, this, new, settlement, resulted, from, demographic, expansion, in, sicily, a, higher, standard, of, living, in, sicily, in, which, case, the, recolonisation, may, have, taken, place, a, few, decades, earlier, or, a, civil, war, which, broke, out, among, the, arab, rulers, of, sicily, in, 1038, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, introduced, new, irrigation, cotton, and, some, fruits, the, siculo, arabic, language, was,

leader, roger, i, of, sicily, was, welcomed, by, christian, captives, the, notion, that, count, roger, i, reportedly, tore, off, a, portion, of, his, checkered, red, and, white, banner, and, presented, it, to, the, maltese, in, gratitude, for, having, fought, on, his, behalf, forming, the, basis, of, the, modern, flag, of, malta, is, founded, in, myth, malta, became, part, of, the, newly,

families, fighting, over, the, distinction, this, led, king, martin, i, of, sicily, to, abolish, the, title, the, dispute, over, the, title, returned, when, the, title, was, reinstated, a, few, years, later, and, the, maltese, led, by, the, local, nobility, rose, up, against, count, gonsalvo, monroy, although, they, opposed, the, count, the, maltese, voiced, their, loyalty, to, the, sicilian, crown, which, so, impressed, king, alfonso, that, he, did, not, punish, the, people, for, their, rebellion, instead, he, promised, never, to, grant, the, title, to, a, third, party, and, incorporated,

in, the, work, of, their, maltese, contemporaries, such, as, gio, nicola, buhagiar, and, francesco, zahra, the, rococo, movement, was, greatly, enhanced, by, the, relocation, to, malta, of, antoine,
