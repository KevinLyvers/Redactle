greece, it, was, a, centre, for, democracy, the, arts, education, and, philosophy, and, was, highly, influential, throughout, the, european, continent, particularly, in, ancient, rome, for, this,

landmark, of, early, western, culture, the, city, also, retains, roman, byzantine, and, a, smaller, number, of, ottoman, monuments, while, its, historical, urban, core, features, elements, of,

city, was, ath, nai, pronounced, in, classical, attic, which, is, a, plural, word, in, earlier, greek, such, as, homeric, greek, the, name, had, been, current, in, the, singular, form, though, as, ath, n, it, was, possibly, rendered, in, the, plural, later, on, like, those, of, th, bai, and, uk, nai, the, root, of, the, word, is, probably, not, of, greek, or, indo, european, origin, and, is, possibly, a, remnant, of, the, pre, greek, substrate, of, attica, in, antiquity, it, was, debated, whether, athens, took, its, name, from, its, patron, goddess, athena, attic, ath, n, ionic, ath, n, and, doric, ath, n, or, athena, took, her, name, from, the, city, modern, scholars, now, generally, agree, that, the, goddess, takes, her, name, from, the, city, because, the, ending, ene, is, common, in, names, of, locations, but, rare, for, personal, names, according, to, the, ancient, athenian, founding, myth, athena, the, goddess, of, wisdom, and, war, competed, against, poseidon, the, god, of, the, seas, for, patronage, of, the, yet, unnamed, city, they, agreed, that, whoever, gave, the, athenians, the, better, gift, would, become, their, patron, and, appointed, cecrops, the, king, of, athens, as, the, judge, according, to, the, account, given, by, pseudo, apollodorus, poseidon, struck, the, ground, with, his, trident, and, a, salt, water, spring, welled, up, in, an, alternative, version, of, the, myth, from, vergil, s, poem, georgics, poseidon, instead, gave, the, athenians, the, first, horse, in, both, versions, athena, offered, the, athenians, the, first, domesticated, olive, tree, cecrops, accepted, this, gift, and, declared, athena, the, patron, goddess, of, athens, eight, different, etymologies, now, commonly, rejected, have, been, proposed, since, the, 17th, century, christian, lobeck, proposed, as, the, root, of, the, name, the, word, thos, or, nthos, meaning, flower, to, denote, athens, as, the, flowering, city, ludwig, von, d, derlein, proposed, the, stem, of, the, verb, stem, th, th, to, suck, to, denote, athens, as, having, fertile, soil, athenians, were, called, cicada, wearers, ancient, greek, because, they, used, to, wear, pins, of, golden, cicadas, a, symbol, of, being, autochthonous, earth, born, because, the, legendary, founder, of, athens, erechtheus, was, an, autochthon, or, of, being, musicians, because, the, cicada, is, a, musician, insect, in, classical, literature, the, city, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, city, of, the, violet, crown, first, documented, in, pindar, s, iost, phanoi, ath, nai, or, as, t, klein, n, sty, the, glorious, city, during, the, medieval, period, the, name, of, the, city, was, rendered, once, again, in, the, singular, as, variant, names, included, setines, satine, and, astines, all,

called, t, n, and, in, modern, turkish, it, is, atina, the, oldest, known, human, presence, in, athens, is, the, cave, of, schist, which, has, been, dated, to, between, the, 11th, and, 7th, millennia, bc, athens, has, been, continuously, inhabited, for, at, least, 5, 000, years, 3000, bc, by, 1400, bc, the, settlement, had, become, an, important, centre, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, and, the, acropolis, was, the, site, of, a, major, mycenaean, fortress, whose, remains, can, be, recognised, from, sections, of, the, characteristic, cyclopean, walls, unlike, other, mycenaean, centers, such, as, mycenae, and, pylos, it, is, not, known, whether, athens, suffered, destruction, in, about, 1200, bc, an, event, often, attributed, to, a, dorian, invasion, and, the, athenians, always, maintained, that, they, were, pure, ionians, with, no, dorian, element, however, athens, like, many, other, bronze, age, settlements, went, into, economic, decline, for, around, 150, years, afterwards, iron, age, burials, in, the, kerameikos, and, other, locations, are, often, richly, provided, for, and, demonstrate, that, from, 900, bc, onwards, athens, was, one, of, the, leading, centres, of, trade, and, prosperity, in, the, region, by, the, sixth, century, bc, widespread, social, unrest, led, to, the, reforms, of, solon, these, would, pave, the, way, for, the, eventual, introduction, of, democracy, by, cleisthenes, in, 508, bc, athens, had, by, this, time, become, a, significant, naval, power, with, a, large, fleet, and, helped, the, rebellion, of, the, ionian, cities, against, persian, rule, in, the, ensuing, greco, persian, wars, athens, together, with, sparta, led, the, coalition, of, greek, states, that, would, eventually, repel, the, persians, defeating, them, decisively, at, marathon, in, 490, bc, and, crucially, at, salamis, in, 480, bc, however, this, did, not, prevent, athens, from, being, captured, and, sacked, twice, by, the, persians, within, one, year, after, a, heroic, but, ultimately, failed, resistance, at, thermopylae, by, spartans, and, other, greeks, led, by, king, leonidas, after, both, boeotia, and, attica, fell, to, the, persians, the, decades, that, followed, became, known, as, the, golden, age, of, athenian, democracy, during, which, time, athens, became, the, leading, city, of, ancient, greece, with, its, cultural, achievements, laying, the, foundations, for, western, civilization, the, playwrights, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, flourished, in, athens, during, this, time, as, did, the, historians, herodotus, and, thucydides, the, physician, hippocrates, and, the, philosopher, socrates, guided, by, pericles, who, promoted, the, arts, and, fostered, democracy, athens, embarked, on, an, ambitious, building, program, that, saw, the, construction, of, the, acropolis, of, athens, including, the, parthenon, as, well, as, empire, building, via, the, delian, league, originally, intended, as, an, association, of, greek, city, states, to, continue, the, fight, against, the, persians, the, league, soon, turned, into, a, vehicle, for, athens, s, own, imperial, ambitions, the, resulting, tensions, brought, about, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, in, which, athens, was, defeated, by, its, rival, sparta, by, the, mid, 4th, century, bc, the, northern, greek, kingdom, of, macedon, was, becoming, dominant, in, athenian, affairs, in, 338, bc, the, armies, of, philip, ii, defeated, an, alliance, of, some, of, the, greek, city, states, including, athens, and, thebes, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, later, under, rome, athens, was, given, the, status, of, a, free, city, because, of, its, widely, admired, schools, in, the, second, century, ad, the, roman, emperor, hadrian, himself, an, athenian, citizen, ordered, the, construction, of, a, library, a, gymnasium, an, aqueduct, which, is, still, in, use, several, temples, and, sanctuaries, a, bridge, and, financed, the, completion, of, the, temple, of, olympian, zeus, in, the, early, 4th, century, ad, the, eastern, roman, empire, began, to, be, governed, from, constantinople, and, with, the, construction, and, expansion, of, the, imperial, city, many, of, athens, s, works, of, art, were, taken, by, the, emperors, to, adorn, it, the, empire, became, christianized, and, the, use, of, latin, declined, in, favour, of, exclusive, use, of, greek, in, the, roman, imperial, period, both, languages, had, been, used, in, the, later, roman, period, athens, was, ruled, by, the, emperors, continuing, until, the, 13th, century, its, citizens, identifying, themselves, as, citizens, of, the, roman, empire, rhomaioi, the, conversion, of, the, empire, from, paganism, to, christianity, greatly, affected, athens, resulting, in, reduced, reverence, for, the, city, ancient, monuments, such, as, the, parthenon, erechtheion, and, the, hephaisteion, theseion, were, converted, into, churches, as, the, empire, became, increasingly, anti, pagan, athens, became, a, provincial, town, and, experienced, fluctuating, fortunes, the, city, remained, an, important, center, of, learning, especially, of, neoplatonism, with, notable, pupils, including, gregory, of, nazianzus, basil, of, caesarea, and, emperor, julian, r, 355, 363, and, consequently, a, center, of, paganism, christian, items, do, not, appear, in, the, archaeological, record, until, the, early, 5th, century, the, sack, of, the, city, by, the, herules, in, 267, and, by, the, visigoths, under, their, king, alaric, i, r, 395, 410, in, 396, however, dealt, a, heavy, blow, to, the, city, s, fabric, and, fortunes, and, athens, was, henceforth, confined, to, a, small, fortified, area, that, embraced, a, fraction, of, the, ancient, city, the, emperor, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, banned, the, teaching, of, philosophy, by, pagans, in, 529, an, event, whose, impact, on, the, city, is, much, debated, but, is, generally, taken, to, mark, the, end, of, the, ancient, history, of, athens, athens, was, sacked, by, the, slavs, in, 582, but, remained, in, imperial, hands, thereafter, as, highlighted, by, the, visit, of, the, emperor, constans, ii, r, 641, 668, in, 662, 3, and, its, inclusion, in, the, theme, of, hellas, the, city, was, threatened, by, saracen, raids, in, the, 8th, 9th, centuries, in, 896, athens, was, raided, and, possibly, occupied, for, a, short, period, an, event, which, left, some, archaeological, remains, and, elements, of, arabic, ornamentation, in, contemporary, buildings, but, there, is, also, evidence, of, a, mosque, existing, in, the, city, at, the, time, in, the, great, dispute, over, byzantine, iconoclasm, athens, is, commonly, held, to, have, supported, the, iconophile, position, chiefly, due, to, the, role, played, by, empress, irene, of, athens, in, the, ending, of, the, first, period, of, iconoclasm, at, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, a, few, years, later, another, athenian, theophano, became, empress, as, the, wife, of, staurakios, r, 811, 812, invasion, of, the, empire, by, the, turks, after, the, battle, of, manzikert, in, 1071, and, the, ensuing, civil, wars, largely, passed, the, region, by, and, athens, continued, its, provincial, existence, unharmed, when, the, byzantine, empire, was, rescued, by, the, resolute, leadership, of, the, three, komnenos, emperors, alexios, john, and, manuel, attica, and, the, rest, of, greece, prospered, archaeological, evidence, tells, us, that, the, medieval, town, experienced, a, period, of, rapid, and, sustained, growth, starting, in, the, 11th, century, and, continuing, until, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, the, agora, marketplace, had, been, deserted, since, late, antiquity, began, to, be, built, over, and, soon, the, town, became, an, important, centre, for, the, production, of, soaps, and, dyes, the, growth, of, the, town, attracted, the, venetians, and, various, other, traders, who, frequented, the, ports, of, the, aegean, to, athens, this, interest, in, trade, appears, to, have, further, increased, the, economic, prosperity, of, the, town, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, were, the, golden, age, of, byzantine, art, in, athens, almost, all, of, the, most, important, middle, byzantine, churches, in, and, around, athens, were, built, during, these, two, centuries, and, this, reflects, the, growth, of, the, town, in, general, however, this, medieval, prosperity, was, not, to, last, in, 1204, the, fourth, crusade, conquered, athens, and, the, city, was, not, recovered, from, the, latins, before, it, was, taken, by, the, ottoman, turks, it, did, not, become, greek, in, government, again, until, the, 19th, century, from, 1204, until, 1458, athens, was, ruled, by, latins, in, three, separate, periods, following, the, crusades, the, latins, or, franks, were, western, europeans, and, followers, of, the, latin, church, brought, to, the, eastern, mediterranean, during, the, crusades, along, with, rest, of, byzantine, greece, athens, was, part, of, the, series, of, feudal, fiefs, similar, to, the, crusader, states, established, in, syria, and, on, cyprus, after, the, first, crusade, this, period, is, known, as, the, frankokratia, the, first, ottoman, attack, on, athens, which, involved, a, short, lived, occupation, of, the, town, came, in, 1397, under, the, ottoman, generals, yaqub, pasha, and, timurtash, finally, in, 1458, athens, was, captured, by, the, ottomans, under, the, personal, leadership, of, sultan, mehmed, ii, as, the, ottoman, sultan, rode, into, the, city, he, was, greatly, struck, by, the, beauty, of, its, ancient, monuments, and, issued, a, firman, imperial, edict, forbidding, their, looting, or, destruction, on, pain, of, death, the, parthenon, was, converted, into, the, main, mosque, of, the, city, under, ottoman, rule, athens, was, denuded, of, any, importance, and, its, population, severely, declined, leaving, it, as, a, small, country, town, franz, babinger, from, the, early, 17th, century, athens, came, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, kizlar, agha, the, chief, black, eunuch, of, the, sultan, s, harem, the, city, had, originally, been, granted, by, sultan, ahmed, i, r, 1603, 1617, to, basilica, one, of, his, favourite, concubines, who, hailed, from, the, city, in, response, of, complaints, of, maladministration, by, the, local, governors, after, her, death, athens, came, under, the, purview, of, the, kizlar, agha, the, turks, began, a, practice, of, storing, gunpowder, and, explosives, in, the, parthenon, and, propylaea, in, 1640, a, lightning, bolt, struck, the, propylaea, causing, its, destruction, in, 1687, during, the, morean, war, the, acropolis, was, besieged, by, the, venetians, under, francesco, morosini, and, the, temple, of, athena, nike, was, dismantled, by, the, ottomans, to, fortify, the, parthenon, a, shot, fired, during, the, bombardment, of, the, acropolis, caused, a, powder, magazine, in, the, parthenon, to, explode, 26, september, and, the, building, was, severely, damaged, giving, it, largely, the, appearance, it, has, today, the, venetian, occupation, of, athens, lasted, for, six, months, and, both, the, venetians, and, the, ottomans, participated, in, the, looting, of, the, parthenon, one, of, its, western, pediments, was, removed, causing, even, more, damage, to, the, structure, during, the, venetian, occupation, the, two, mosques, of, the, city, were, converted, into, catholic, and, protestant, churches, but, on, 9, april, 1688, the, venetians, abandoned, athens, again, to, the, ottomans, in, 1822, a, greek, insurgency, captured, the, city, but, it, fell, to, the, ottomans, again, in, 1826, though, acropolis, held, till, june, 1827, again, the, ancient, monuments, suffered, badly, the, ottoman, forces, remained, in, possession, until, march, 1833, when, they, withdrew, following, the, greek, war, of, independence, and, the, establishment, of, the, greek, kingdom, athens, was, chosen, to, replace, nafplio, as, the, second, capital, of, the, newly, independent, greek, state, in, 1834, largely, because, of, historical, and, sentimental, reasons, at, the, time, after, the, extensive, destruction, it, had, suffered, during, the, war, of, independence, it, was, reduced, to, a, town, of, about, 4, 000, people, less, than, half, its, earlier, population, in, a, loose, swarm, of, houses, along, the, foot, of, the, acropolis, the, first, king, of, greece, king, otto, of, bavaria, commissioned, the, architects, stamatios, kleanthis, and, eduard, schaubert, to, design, a, modern, city, plan, fit, for, the, capital, of, a, state, the, first, modern, city, plan, consisted, of, a, triangle, defined, by, the, acropolis, the, ancient, cemetery, of, kerameikos, and, the, new, palace, of, the, bavarian, king, now, housing, the, greek, parliament, so, as, to, highlight, the, continuity, between, modern, and, ancient, athens, neoclassicism, the, international, style, of, this, epoch, was, the, architectural, style, through, which, bavarian, french, and, greek, architects, such, as, hansen, klenze, boulanger, or, kaftantzoglou, designed, the, first, important, public, buildings, of, the, new, capital, in, 1896, athens, hosted, the, first, modern, olympic, games, during, the, 1920s, a, number, of, greek, refugees, expelled, from, asia, minor, after, the, greco, turkish, war, and, population, exchange, between, greece, and, turkey, swelled, athens, s, population, nevertheless, it, was, most, particularly, following, world, war, ii, and, from, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, that, the, population, of, the, city, exploded, and, athens, experienced, a, gradual, expansion, in, the, 1980s, it, became, evident, that, smog, from, factories, and, an, ever, increasing, fleet, of, automobiles, as, well, as, a, lack, of, adequate, free, space, due, to, congestion, had, evolved, into, the, city, s, most, important, challenge, a, series, of, anti, pollution, measures, taken, by, the, city, s, authorities, in, the, 1990s, combined, with, a, substantial, improvement, of, the, city, s, infrastructure, including, the, attiki, odos, motorway, the, expansion, of, the, athens, metro, and, the, new, athens, international, airport, considerably, alleviated, pollution, and, transformed, athens, into, a, much, more, functional, city, in, 2004, athens, hosted, the, 2004, summer, olympics, athens, sprawls, across, the, central, plain, of, attica, that, is, often, referred, to, as, the, athens, basin, or, the, attica, basin, greek, romanized, lekanop, dio, athin, n, attik, s, the, basin, is, bounded, by, four, large, mountains, mount, aigaleo, to, the, west, mount, parnitha, to, the, north, mount, pentelicus, to, the, northeast, and, mount, hymettus, to, the, east, beyond, mount, aegaleo, lies, the, thriasian, plain, which, forms, an, extension, of, the, central, plain, to, the, west, the, saronic, gulf, lies, to, the, southwest, mount, parnitha, is, the, tallest, of, the, four, mountains, 1, 413, m, 4, 636, ft, and, has, been, declared, a, national, park, the, athens, urban, area, spreads, over, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, from, agios, stefanos, in, the, north, to, varkiza, in, the, south, the, city, is, located, in, the, north, temperate, zone, 38, degrees, north, of, the, equator, athens, is, built, around, a, large, number, of, hills, lycabettus, is, one, of, the, tallest, hills, of, the, city, proper, and, provides, a, view, of, the, entire, attica, basin, the, meteorology, of, athens, is, deemed, to, be, one, of, the, most, complex, in, the, world, because, its, mountains, cause, a, temperature, inversion, phenomenon, which, along, with, the, greek, government, s, difficulties, controlling, industrial, pollution, was, responsible, for, the, air, pollution, problems, the, city, has, faced, this, issue, is, not, unique, to, athens, for, instance, los, angeles, and, mexico, city, also, suffer, from, similar, atmospheric, inversion, problems, the, cephissus, river, the, ilisos, and, the, eridanos, stream, are, the, historical, rivers, of, athens, by, the, late, 1970s, the, pollution, of, athens, had, become, so, destructive, that, according, to, the, then, greek, minister, of, culture, constantine, trypanis, the, carved, details, on, the, five, the, caryatids, of, the, erechtheum, had, seriously, degenerated, while, the, face, of, the, horseman, on, the, parthenon, s, west, side, was, all, but, obliterated, a, series, of, measures, taken, by, the, authorities, of, the, city, throughout, the, 1990s, resulted, in, the, improvement, of, air, quality, the, appearance, of, smog, or, nefos, as, the, athenians, used, to, call, it, has, become, less, common, measures, taken, by, the, greek, authorities, throughout, the, 1990s, have, improved, the, quality, of, air, over, the, attica, basin, nevertheless, air, pollution, still, remains, an, issue, for, athens, particularly, during, the, hottest, summer, days, in, late, june, 2007, the, attica, region, experienced, a, number, of, brush, fires, including, a, blaze, that, burned, a, significant, portion, of, a, large, forested, national, park, in, mount, parnitha, considered, critical, to, maintaining, a, better, air, quality, in, athens, all, year, round, damage, to, the, park, has, led, to, worries, over, a, stalling, in, the, improvement, of, air, quality, in, the, city, the, major, waste, management, efforts, undertaken, in, the, last, decade, particularly, the, plant, built, on, the, small, island, of, psytalia, have, greatly, improved, water, quality, in, the, saronic, gulf, and, the, coastal, waters, of, athens,
