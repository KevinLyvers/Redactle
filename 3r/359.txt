of, r, mqi, then, there, is, a, low, area, between, r, mqi, and, the, turfan, depression, the, borohoro, mountains, start, just, south, of, r, mqi, and, run, west, northwest, 450, kilometres, 280, mi, separating, dzungaria, from, the, ili, river, basin, their, north, end, abuts, on, the, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, dzungarian, alatau, which, runs, east, northeast, along, sino, kazakh, border, they, start, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, east, of, taldykorgan, in, kazakhstan, and, end, at, the, dzungarian, gate, the, dzungarian, alatau, in, the, north, the, borohoro, mountains, in, the, middle, and, the, ketmen, ridge, in, the, south, make, a, reversed, z, or, s, the, northeast, enclosing, part, of, dzungaria, and, the, southwest, enclosing, the, upper, ili, valley, in, kyrgyzstan, the, mainline, of, the, tian, shan, continues, as, narat, range, from, the, base, of, the, borohoros, west, 570, kilometres, 350, mi, to, the, point, where, china, kazakhstan, and, kyrgyzstan, meet, here, is, the, highest, part, of, the, range, the, central, tian, shan, with, peak, pobeda, kakshaal, too, range, and, khan, tengri, west, of, this, the, tian, shan, split, into, an, eye, with, issyk, kul, lake, in, its, center, the, south, side, of, the, lake, is, the, terskey, alatau, and, the, north, side, the, kyungey, ala, too, shady, and, sunny, ala, too, north, of, the, kyungey, ala, too, and, parallel, to, it, is, the, trans, ili, alatau, in, kazakhstan, just, south, of, almaty, west, of, the, eye, the, range, continues, 400, kilometres, 250, mi, as, the, kyrgyz, ala, too, separating, ch, y, region, from, naryn, region, and, then, kazakhstan, from, the, upper, valley, of, the, river, talas, the, south, side, of, which, is, the, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, talas, ala, too, range, ala, too, is, a,

fergana, valley, there, is, an, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, group, of, mountains, that, curves, west, southwest, from, south, of, issyk, kul, lake, separating, the, tarim, basin, from, the, fergana, valley, the, fergana, range, runs, northeast, towards, the, talas, ala, too, and, separates, the, upper, naryn, basin, from, fergana, proper, the, southern, side, of, these, mountains, merge, into, the, pamirs, in, tajikistan, alay, mountains, and, trans, alay, range, west, of, this, is, the, turkestan, range, which, continues, almost, to, samarkand, the, tian, shan, plateau, stretching, 100, to, 120, km, wide, is, located, on, the, northern, margin, of, the, tarim, basin, between, the, kokshaal, tau, mountain, chain, to, the, south, and, the, terskey, alatau, mountain, chain, to, the, north, the, kokshaal, tau, extends, for, 570, km, from, pik, dankowa, in, the, west, to, pik, pobeda, in, the, east, northeast, this, mountain, chain, along, with, the, parallel, terskey, alatau, and, the, tian, shan, plateau, in, between, were, covered, by, connected, ice, stream, networks, and, a, plateau, glacier, during, glacial, times, the, only, remaining, interglacial, remnant, of, this, glaciation, is, the, 61, km, long, south, inylschek, glacier, the, outlet, glacier, tongues, of, the, plateau, glacier, flowed, northward, down, to, lake, issyk, kul, calving, in, this, 160, km, long, lake, similarly, strong, glaciation, was, present, in, the, high, mountain, area, of, the, kungey, alatau, which, stretches, for, 230, km, north, of, issyk, kul, and, connects, to, the, mountain, foreland, near, alma, ata, the, glacial, glaciers, from, the, kungey, alatau, also, calved, into, lake, issyk, kul, with, the, ak, sai, valley, glacier, developing, a, mountain, foreland, glacier, the, chon, kemin, valley, was, glaciated, up, to, its, inflow, into, the, chu, valley, altogether, the, glacial, tian, shan, glaciation, occupied, an, area, of, approximately, 118, 000, square, kilometers, the, glacier, snowline, was, about, 1200m, lower, during, the, last, ice, age, than, it, is, today, this, would, result, in, a, depression, of, the, average, annual, temperature, of, 7, 2, to, 8, 4, c, for, the, last, glacial, maximum, compared, with, today, assuming, a, comparable, precipitation, ratio, the, tian, shan, holds, important, forests, of, schrenk, s, spruce, picea, schrenkiana, at, altitudes, of, over, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, the, lower, slopes, have, unique, natural, forests, of, wild, walnuts, and, apples, the, tian, shan, in, its, immediate, geological, past, was, kept, from, glaciation, due, to, the, protecting, warm, influence, of, the, indian, ocean, monsoon, climate, this, defined, its, ecological, features, which, could, sustain, its, distinctive, ecosphere, the, mountains, were, subjected, to, constant, geological, changes, with, constantly, evolving, drainage, systems, which, affected, the, patterns, of, vegetation, as, well, as, exposing, fertile, soil, for, newly, emerging, seedlings, to, thrive, in, tulips, originated, in, the, tian, shan, mountains, the, plant, then, made, its, way, to, turkey, via, the, silk, road, and, became, a, symbol, of, the, ottoman, empire, ancestors, of, important, crop, vegetation, were, established, and, thrived, in, the, area, among, them, apricots, prunus, armeniaca, pears, pyrus, spp, pomegranates, punica, granatum, figs, ficus, cherries, prunus, avium, and, mulberries, morus, the, tian, shan, region, also, included, important, animals, like, bears, deer, and, wild, boar, which, helped, to, spread, seeds, and, expand, ecological, diversity, among, the, vegetation, colonizing, the, tian, shan, came, likely, via, birds, from, the, east, the, ancestors, of, what, we, know, as, the, sweet, apple, the, fruit, probably, then, looked, like, a, tiny, long, stalked, bitter, apple, something, like, malus, baccata, the, siberian, crab, the, pips, may, have, been, carried, in, a, bird, s, crop, or, clotted, onto, feet, or, feathers, what, natural, features, of, the, unique, tian, shan, might, have, contributed, to, this, rigorous, selection, program, time, is, as, we, have, seen, not, a, problem, the, turnover, of, individual, trees, is, likewise, conducive, to, the, rapid, evolution, of, a, tree, species, as, is, the, fact, that, sweet, apples, are, now, at, least, for, all, practical, purposes, self, incompatible, that, is, they, cannot, pollinate, themselves, therefore, each, apple, tree, within, the, forest, and, even, each, pip, usually, five, within, each, individual, fruit, will, be, different, there, are, many, apples, on, a, mature, tree, so, natural, selection, has, a, rich, and, diverse, population, upon, which, to, work, birds, of, course, eat, all, manner, of, fruit, but, most, birds, eat, seeds, a, dietary, feature, not, conducive, either, to, the, selection, or, spread, of, a, fruit, tree, sweet, apples, are, often, eviscerated, by, birds, but, the, seeds, are, frequently, left, in, the, empty, shell, of, the, pome, the, reason, is, that, apple, and, pear, and, quince, seeds, are, rich, in, cyanoglycosides, which, are, highly, repellent, particularly, to, birds, moreover, the, placenta, of, the, apple, fruit, the, womb, contains, inhibitory, substances, that, prevent, the, germination, of, the, apple, seed, in, situ, this, is, a, commonly, observed, phenomenon, in, fruits, as, michael, evenari, showed, in, 1949, so, what, then, does, or, did, distribute, the, original, apple, seed, the, bear, the, strain, of, y, pestis, which, caused, the, bubonic, plague, now, know, as, the, black, death, may, have, originated, in, the, tian, shan, spreading, along, the, silk, road, and, killing, half, of, europe, s, population, in, the, mid, 1300s, tian, shan, has, an, alpine, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, eth, in, tengrism, khan, tengri, is, the, lord, of, all, spirits, and, the, religion, s, supreme, deity, and, it, is, the, name, given, to, the, second, highest, peak, of, tian, shan, one, of, the, earliest, historical, references, to, these, mountains, may, be, related, to, the, xiongnu, word, qilian, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, q, li, n, which, according, to, tang, commentator, yan, shigu, is, the, xiongnu, word, for, sky, or, heaven, sima, qian, in, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, mentioned, qilian, in, relation, to, the, homeland, of, the, yuezhi, and, the, term, is, believed, to, refer, to, the, tian, shan, rather, than, the, range, 1, 500, kilometres, 930, mi, further, east, now, known, as, the, qilian, mountains, the, name, of, the, tannu, ola, mountains, in, tuva, has, the, same, meaning, the, chinese, name, tian, shan, is, most, likely, a, direct, translation, of, the, traditional, kyrgyz, name, for, the, mountains, te, ir, too
