plain, area, was, used, as, hunting, grounds, the, bahoruco, mountain, range, in, the, north, east, of, port, au, prince, was, the, scene, of, a, taino, rebellion, led, by, enriquillo, resulting, in, a, treaty, with, the, spanish, prior, to, the, arrival, of, christopher, columbus, the, island, of, hispaniola, was, inhabited, by, the, ta, no, people, who, arrived, in, approximately, 2600, bc, in, large, dugout, canoes, they, are, believed, to, come, primarily, from, what, is, now, eastern, venezuela, by, the, time, columbus, arrived, in, 1492, ad, the, region, was, under, the, control, of, bohechio, ta, no, cacique, chief, xaragua, he, like, his, predecessors, feared, settling, too, close, to, the, coast, such, settlements, would, have, proven, to, be, tempting, targets, for, the, caribs, who, lived, on, neighboring, islands, instead, the, region, served, as, a, hunting, ground, the, population, of, the, region, was, approximately, 400, 000, at, the, time, but, the, ta, nos, were, gone, within, 30, years, of, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, with, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, the, amerindians, were, forced, to, accept, a, protectorate, and, bohechio, childless, at, death, was, succeeded, by, his, sister, anacaona, wife, of, the, cacique, caonabo, the, spanish, insisted, on, larger, tributes, eventually, the, spanish, colonial, administration, decided, to, rule, directly, and, in, 1503, nicolas, ovando, then, governor, set, about, to, put, an, end, to, the, r, gime, headed, by, anacaona, he, invited, her, and, other, tribal, leaders, to, a, feast, and, when, the, amerindians, had, drunk, a, good, deal, of, wine, the, spaniards, did, not, drink, on, that, occasion, he, ordered, most, of, the, guests, killed, anacaona, was, spared, only, to, be, hanged, publicly, some, time, later, through, violence, introduced, diseases, and, murders, the, spanish, settlers, decimated, the, native, population, direct, spanish, rule, over, the, area, having, been, established, ovando, founded, a, settlement, not, far, from, the, coast, west, of, etang, saum, tre, ironically, named, santa, maria, de, la, paz, verdadera, which, would, be, abandoned, several, years, later, not, long, thereafter, ovando, founded, santa, maria, del, puerto, the, latter, was, first, burned, by, french, explorers, in, 1535, then, again, in, 1592, by, the, english, these, assaults, proved, to, be, too, much, for, the, spanish, colonial, administration, and, in, 1606, it, decided, to, abandon, the, region, for, more, than, 50, years, the, area, that, is, today, port, au, prince, saw, its, population, drop, off, drastically, when, some, buccaneers, began, to, use, it, as, a, base, and, dutch, merchants, began, to, frequent, it, in, search, of, leather, as, game, was, abundant, there, around, 1650, french, flibustiers, running, out, of, room, on, the, le, de, la, tortue, began, to, arrive, on, the, coast, and, established, a, colony, at, trou, borded, as, the, colony, grew, they, set, up, a, hospital, not, far, from, the, coast, on, the, turgeau, heights, this, led, to, the, region, being, known, as, h, pital, although, there, had, been, no, real, spanish, presence, in, h, pital, for, well, over, 50, years, spain, retained, its, formal, claim, to, the, territory, and, the, growing, presence, of, the, french, flibustiers, on, ostensibly, spanish, lands, provoked, the, spanish, crown, to, dispatch, castilian, soldiers, to, h, pital, to, retake, it, the, mission, proved, to, be, a, disaster, for, the, spanish, as, they, were, outnumbered, and, outgunned, and, in, 1697, the, spanish, government, signed, the, treaty, of, ryswick, renouncing, any, claims, to, h, pital, around, this, time, the, french, also, established, bases, at, ester, part, of, petite, rivi, re, and, gona, ves, ester, was, a, rich, village, inhabited, by, merchants, and, equipped, with, straight, streets, it, was, here, that, the, governor, lived, on, the, other, hand, the, surrounding, region, petite, rivi, re, was, quite, poor, following, a, great, fire, in, 1711, ester, was, abandoned, yet, the, french, presence, in, the, region, continued, to, grow, and, soon, afterward, a, new, city, was, founded, to, the, south, l, og, ne, while, the, first, french, presence, in, h, pital, the, region, later, to, contain, port, au, prince, was, that, of, the, flibustiers, as, the, region, became, a, real, french, colony, the, colonial, administration, began, to, worry, about, the, continual, presence, of, these, pirates, while, useful, in, repelling, foreign, pirates, they, were, relatively, independent, unresponsive, to, orders, from, the, colonial, administration, and, a, potential, threat, to, it, therefore, in, the, winter, of, 1707, choiseul, beaupr, the, governor, of, the, region, sought, to, get, rid, of, what, he, saw, as, a, threat, he, insisted, upon, control, of, the, hospital, but, the, flibustiers, refused, considering, that, humiliating, they, proceeded, to, close, the, hospital, rather, than, cede, control, of, it, to, the, governor, and, many, of, them, became, habitans, farmers, the, first, long, term, european, inhabitants, in, the, region, although, the, elimination, of, the, flibustiers, as, a, group, from, h, pital, reinforced, the, authority, of, the, colonial, administration, it, also, made, the, region, a, more, attractive, target, for, marauding, buccaneers, in, order, to, protect, the, area, in, 1706, a, captain, named, de, saint, andr, sailed, into, the, bay, just, below, the, hospital, in, a, ship, named, le, prince, it, is, said, that, m, de, saint, andr, named, the, area, port, au, prince, meaning, port, of, the, prince, but, the, port, and, the, surrounding, region, continued, to, be, known, as, h, pital, but, the, islets, in, the, bay, had, already, been, known, as, les, lets, du, prince, as, early, as, 1680, pirates, eventually, refrained, from, troubling, the, area, and, various, nobles, sought, land, grants, from, the, french, crown, in, h, pital, the, first, noble, to, control, h, pital, was, sieur, joseph, randot, upon, his, death, in, 1737, sieur, pierre, morel, gained, control, over, part, of, the, region, with, gatien, bretton, des, chapelles, acquiring, another, portion, of, it, by, then, the, colonial, administration, was, convinced, that, a, capital, needed, to, be, chosen, in, order, to, better, control, the, french, portion, of, hispaniola, saint, domingue, for, a, time, petit, go, ve, and, l, og, ne, vied, for, this, honor, but, both, were, eventually, ruled, out, for, various, reasons, neither, was, centrally, located, petit, go, ve, s, climate, caused, it, to, be, too, malarial, and, l, ogane, s, topography, made, it, difficult, to, defend, thus, in, 1749, a, new, city,
