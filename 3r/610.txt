technical, and, logistics, issues, caused, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, effects, of, phosphate, mining, in, nauru, have, had, significant, negative, impacts, on, the, island, s, environment, and, economy, one, of, the, most, prominent, effects, of, the, phosphate, mining, in, nauru, is, the, extensive, environmental, degradation, that, has, occurred, as, a, result, of, the, extraction, of, phosphates, large, areas, of, the, island, have, been, stripped, of, vegetation, and, topsoil, leaving, behind, barren, landscapes, that, are, prone, to, erosion, and, degradation, the, mining, activities, have, also, caused, significant, disruption, to, the, island, s, ecosystem, leading, to, a, decline, in, biodiversity, and, the, extinction, of, several, plant, and, animal, species, historically, indigenous, nauruans, kept, household, gardens, that, provided, much, of, the, food, that, they, needed, through, subsistence, farming, with, the, most, common, food, plants, including, coconuts, breadfruit, bananas, pandanus, papaya, and, guavas, because, of, the, large, immigrant, population, that, would, work, in, the, phosphate, mines, there, were, many, types, of, fruits, and, vegetables, grown, that, were, staples, in, those, countries, as, well, the, soil, in, nauru, was, very, rich, on, what, citizens, call, the, topside, which, is, the, raised, phosphate, plateau, where, the, phosphate, is, mined, from, and, it, was, extremely, fertile, and, great, for, growing, crops, however, the, area, where, most, nauruans, live, now, on, the, coastal, ring, on, the, island, that, hasn, t, been, mined, the, soil, quality, is, among, the, poorest, in, the, world, as, it, is, shallow, alkaline, and, has, the, coarse, texture, of, the, coral, that, surrounds, it, in, 2011, just, 13, of, households, maintained, a, garden, or, were, involved, in, growing, crops, most, of, the, soil, that, was, on, nauru, is, now, gone, because, of, phosphate, mining, activities, leaving, people, to, import, the, soil, that, they, need, ethnobotanical, studies, have, indicated, that, the, reduction, in, the, types, of, plants, that, can, be, grown, due, to, phosphate, mining, has, significantly, impacted, the, connection, that, indigenous, nauruans, feel, to, the, land, as, plants, are, a, large, part, of, their, cultural, identity, and, have, many, uses, in, their, lives, with, each, plant, having, an, average, of, seven, uses, within, pacific, island, cultures, for, nauru, residents, today, all, food, must, also, be, imported, because, of, the, loss, of, 90, of, tenable, land, due, to, phosphate, mining, leaving, people, with, a, diet, of, mainly, processed, foods, such, as, rice, and, sugar, though, residents, are, trying, to, salvage, the, soil, that, they, can, some, researchers, speculate, that, there, will, be, no, regeneration, of, soils, even, after, the, mining, ceases, the, country, s, dependence, on, processed, and, imported, foods, along, with, cultural, historical, and, social, factors, have, greatly, affected, the, health, of, its, citizens, despite, having, all, food, imported, the, household, and, income, expenditure, survey, hies, conducted, for, the, year, of, 2012, 2013, found, that, nauruans, have, a, food, poverty, incidence, rate, of, 0, based, on, the, food, poverty, line, fpl, which, includes, a, daily, intake, of, 2, 100, calories, per, adult, per, day, while, the, hies, found, that, nauru, is, doing, well, in, terms, of, food, poverty, 24, of, the, population, and, 16, 8, of, households, are, below, the, basic,

other, commercial, and, household, wastes, causing, nauruans, to, rely, on, imported, water, the, price, of, which, can, vary, as, it, is, closely, tied, to, fuel, prices, for, its, delivery, and,
