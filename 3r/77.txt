main, five, oceans, division, further, subdivision, the, arctic, ocean, is, the, smallest, and, shallowest, of, the, world, s, five, oceanic, divisions, it, spans, an, area, of, approximately, 14, 060, 000, km, 2, 5, 430, 000, sq, mi, and, is, the, coldest, of, the, world, s, oceans, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, recognizes, it, as, an, ocean, although, some, oceanographers, call, it, the, arctic, mediterranean, sea, it, has, also, been, described, as, an, estuary, of, the, atlantic, ocean, it, is, also, seen, as, the, northernmost, part, of, the, all, encompassing, world, ocean, the, arctic, ocean, includes, the, north, pole, region, in, the, middle, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, extends, south, to, about, 60, n, the, arctic, ocean, is, surrounded, by, eurasia, and, north, america, and, the, borders, follow, topographic, features, the, bering, strait, on, the, pacific, side, and, the, greenland, scotland, ridge, on, the, atlantic, side, it, is, mostly, covered, by, sea, ice, throughout, the, year, and, almost, completely, in, winter, the, arctic, ocean, s, surface, temperature, and, salinity, vary, seasonally, as, the, ice, cover, melts, and, freezes, its, salinity, is, the, lowest, on, average, of, the, five, major, oceans, due, to, low, evaporation, heavy, fresh, water, inflow, from, rivers, and, streams, and, limited, connection, and, outflow, to, surrounding, oceanic, waters, with, higher, salinities, the, summer, shrinking, of, the, ice, has, been, quoted, at, 50, the, us, national, snow, and, ice, data, center, nsidc, uses, satellite, data, to, provide, a, daily, record, of, arctic, sea, ice, cover, and, the, rate, of, melting, compared, to, an, average, period, and, specific, past, years, showing, a, continuous, decline, in, sea, ice, extent, in, september, 2012, the, arctic, ice, extent, reached, a, new, record, minimum, compared, to, the, average, extent, 1979, 2000, the, sea, ice, had, diminished, by, 49, human, habitation, in, the, north, american, polar, region, goes, back, at, least, 17, 000, 50, 000, years, during, the, wisconsin, glaciation, at, this, time, falling, sea, levels, allowed, people, to, move, across, the, bering, land, bridge, that, joined, siberia, to, northwestern, north, america, alaska, leading, to, the, settlement, of, the, americas, early, paleo, eskimo, groups, included, the, pre, dorset, c, 3200, 850, bc, the, saqqaq, culture, of, greenland, 2500, 800, bc, the, independence, i, and, independence, ii, cultures, of, northeastern, canada, and, greenland, c, 2400, 1800, bc, and, c, 800, 1, bc, and, the, groswater, of, labrador, and, nunavik, the, dorset, culture, spread, across, arctic, north, america, between, 500, bc, and, ad, 1500, the, dorset, were, the, last, major, paleo, eskimo, culture, in, the, arctic, before, the, migration, east, from, present, day, alaska, of, the, thule, people, ancestors, of, the, modern, inuit, the, thule, tradition, lasted, from, about, 200, bc, to, ad, 1600, arising, around, the, bering, strait, and, later, encompassing, almost, the, entire, arctic, region, of, north, america, the, thule, people, were, the, ancestors, of, the, inuit, who, now, live, in, alaska, northwest, territories, nunavut, nunavik, northern, quebec, labrador, and, greenland, for, much, of, european, history, the, north, polar, regions, remained, largely, unexplored, and, their, geography, conjectural, pytheas, of, massilia, recorded, an, account, of, a, journey, northward, in, 325, bc, to, a, land, he, called, eschate, thule, where, the, sun, only, set, for, three, hours, each, day, and, the, water, was, replaced, by, a, congealed, substance, on, which, one, can, neither, walk, nor, sail, he, was, probably, describing, loose, sea, ice, known, today, as, growlers, or, bergy, bits, his, thule, was, probably, norway, though, the, faroe, islands, or, shetland, have, also, been, suggested, early, cartographers, were, unsure, whether, to, draw, the, region, around, the, north, pole, as, land, as, in, johannes, ruysch, s, map, of, 1507, or, gerardus, mercator, s, map, of, 1595, or, water, as, with, martin, waldseem, ller, s, world, map, of, 1507, the, fervent, desire, of, european, merchants, for, a, northern, passage, the, northern, sea, route, or, the, northwest, passage, to, cathay, china, caused, water, to, win, out, and, by, 1723, mapmakers, such, as, johann, homann, featured, an, extensive, oceanus, septentrionalis, at, the, northern, edge, of, their, charts, the, few, expeditions, to, penetrate, much, beyond, the, arctic, circle, in, that, era, added, only, small, islands, such, as, novaya, zemlya, 11th, century, and, spitzbergen, 1596, though, since, these, were, often, surrounded, by, pack, ice, their, northern, limits, were, not, so, clear, the, makers, of, navigational, charts, more, conservative, than, some, of, the, more, fanciful, cartographers, tended, to, leave, the, region, blank, with, only, fragments, of, known, coastline, sketched, in, this, lack, of, knowledge, of, what, lay, north, of, the, shifting, barrier, of, ice, gave, rise, to, a, number, of, conjectures, in, england, and, other, european, nations, the, myth, of, an, open, polar, sea, was, persistent, john, barrow, longtime, second, secretary, of, the, british, admiralty, promoted, exploration, of, the, region, from, 1818, to, 1845, in, search, of, this, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, the, explorers, elisha, kane, and, isaac, israel, hayes, both, claimed, to, have, seen, part, of, this, elusive, body, of, water, even, quite, late, in, the, century, the, eminent, authority, matthew, fontaine, maury, included, a, description, of, the, open, polar, sea, in, his, textbook, the, physical, geography, of, the, sea, 1883, nevertheless, as, all, the, explorers, who, travelled, closer, and, closer, to, the, pole, reported, the, polar, ice, cap, is, quite, thick, and, persists, year, round, fridtjof, nansen, was, the, first, to, make, a, nautical, crossing, of, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, fram, expedition, from, 1893, to, 1896, the, first, surface, crossing, of, the, ocean, was, led, by, wally, herbert, in, 1969, in, a, dog, sled, expedition, from, alaska, to, svalbard, with, air, support, the, first, nautical, transit, of, the, north, pole, was, made, in, 1958, by, the, submarine, uss, nautilus, and, the, first, surface, nautical, transit, occurred, in, 1977, by, the, icebreaker, ns, arktika, since, 1937, soviet, and, russian, manned, drifting, ice, stations, have, extensively, monitored, the, arctic, ocean, scientific, settlements, were, established, on, the, drift, ice, and, carried, thousands, of, kilometres, by, ice, floes, in, world, war, ii, the, european, region, of, the, arctic, ocean, was, heavily, contested, the, allied, commitment, to, resupply, the, soviet, union, via, its, northern, ports, was, opposed, by, german, naval, and, air, forces, since, 1954, commercial, airlines, have, flown, over, the, arctic, ocean, see, polar, route, the, arctic, ocean, occupies, a, roughly, circular, basin, and, covers, an, area, of, about, 14, 056, 000, km, 2, 5, 427, 000, sq, mi, almost, the, size, of, antarctica, the, coastline, is, 45, 390, km, 28, 200, mi, long, it, is, the, only, ocean, smaller, than, russia, which, has, a, land, area, of, 16, 377, 742, km, 2, 6, 323, 482, sq, mi, the, arctic, ocean, is, surrounded, by, the, land, masses, of, eurasia, russia, and, norway, north, america, canada, and, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, greenland, and, iceland, note, some, parts, of, the, areas, listed, in, the, table, are, located, in, the, atlantic, ocean, other, consists, of, gulfs, straits, channels, and, other, parts, without, specific, names, and, excludes, exclusive, economic, zones, the, arctic, ocean, is, connected, to, the, pacific, ocean, by, the, bering, strait, and, to, the, atlantic, ocean, through, the, greenland, sea, and, labrador, sea, the, iceland, sea, is, sometimes, considered, part, of, the, greenland, sea, and, sometimes, separate, the, largest, seas, in, the, arctic, ocean, different, authorities, put, various, marginal, seas, in, either, the, arctic, ocean, or, the, atlantic, ocean, including, hudson, bay, baffin, bay, the, norwegian, sea, and, hudson, strait, the, main, islands, and, archipelagos, in, the, arctic, ocean, are, from, the, prime, meridian, west, there, are, several, ports, and, harbours, on, the, arctic, ocean, the, ocean, s, arctic, shelf, comprises, a, number, of, continental, shelves, including, the, canadian, arctic, shelf, underlying, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, and, the, russian, continental, shelf, which, is, sometimes, called, the, arctic, shelf, because, it, is, larger, the, russian, continental, shelf, consists, of, three, separate, smaller, shelves, the, barents, shelf, chukchi, sea, shelf, and, siberian, shelf, of, these, three, the, siberian, shelf, is, the, largest, such, shelf, in, the, world, it, holds, large, oil, and, gas, reserves, the, chukchi, shelf, forms, the, border, between, russian, and, the, united, states, as, stated, in, the, ussr, usa, maritime, boundary, agreement, the, whole, area, is, subject, to, international, territorial, claims, the, chukchi, plateau, extends, from, the, chukchi, sea, shelf, an, underwater, ridge, the, lomonosov, ridge, divides, the, deep, sea, north, polar, basin, into, two, oceanic, basins, the, eurasian, basin, which, is, 4, 000, 4, 500, m, 13, 100, 14, 800, ft, deep, and, the, amerasian, basin, sometimes, called, the, north, american, or, hyperborean, basin, which, is, about, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, deep, the, bathymetry, of, the, ocean, bottom, is, marked, by, fault, block, ridges, abyssal, plains, ocean, deeps, and, basins, the, average, depth, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, 1, 038, m, 3, 406, ft, the, deepest, point, is, molloy, hole, in, the, fram, strait, at, about, 5, 550, m, 18, 210, ft, the, two, major, basins, are, further, subdivided, by, ridges, into, the, canada, basin, between, beaufort, shelf, of, north, america, and, the, alpha, ridge, makarov, basin, between, the, alpha, and, lomonosov, ridges, amundsen, basin, between, lomonosov, and, gakkel, ridges, and, nansen, basin, between, the, gakkel, ridge, and, the, continental, shelf, that, includes, the, franz, josef, land, the, crystalline, basement, rocks, of, mountains, around, the, arctic, ocean, were, recrystallized, or, formed, during, the, ellesmerian, orogeny, the, regional, phase, of, the, larger, caledonian, orogeny, in, the, paleozoic, era, regional, subsidence, in, the, jurassic, and, triassic, periods, led, to, significant, sediment, deposition, creating, many, of, the, reservoirs, for, current, day, oil, and, gas, deposits, during, the, cretaceous, period, the, canadian, basin, opened, and, tectonic, activity, due, to, the, assembly, of, alaska, caused, hydrocarbons, to, migrate, toward, what, is, now, prudhoe, bay, at, the, same, time, sediments, shed, off, the, rising, canadian, rockies, built, out, the, large, mackenzie, delta, the, rifting, apart, of, the, supercontinent, pangea, beginning, in, the, triassic, period, opened, the, early, atlantic, ocean, rifting, then, extended, northward, opening, the, arctic, ocean, as, mafic, oceanic, crust, material, erupted, out, of, a, branch, of, mid, atlantic, ridge, the, amerasia, basin, may, have, opened, first, with, the, chukchi, borderland, moved, along, to, the, northeast, by, transform, faults, additional, spreading, helped, to, create, the, triple, junction, of, the, alpha, mendeleev, ridge, in, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, throughout, the, cenozoic, era, the, subduction, of, the, pacific, plate, the, collision, of, india, with, eurasia, and, the, continued, opening, of, the, north, atlantic, created, new, hydrocarbon, traps, the, seafloor, began, spreading, from, the, gakkel, ridge, in, the, paleocene, epoch, and, the, eocene, epoch, causing, the, lomonosov, ridge, to, move, farther, from, land, and, subside, because, of, sea, ice, and, remote, conditions, the, geology, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, still, poorly, explored, the, arctic, coring, expedition, drilling, shed, some, light, on, the, lomonosov, ridge, which, appears, to, be, continental, crust, separated, from, the, barents, kara, shelf, in, the, paleocene, and, then, starved, of, sediment, it, may, contain, up, to, 10, billion, barrels, of, oil, the, gakkel, ridge, rift, is, also, poorly, understand, and, may, extend, into, the, laptev, sea, in, large, parts, of, the, arctic, ocean, the, top, layer, about, 50, m, is, of, lower, salinity, and, lower, temperature, than, the, rest, it, remains, relatively, stable, because, the, salinity, effect, on, density, is, bigger, than, the, temperature, effect, it, is, fed, by, the, freshwater, input, of, the, big, siberian, and, canadian, rivers, ob, yenisei, lena, mackenzie, the, water, of, which, quasi, floats, on, the, saltier, denser, deeper, ocean, water, between, this, lower, salinity, layer, and, the, bulk, of, the, ocean, lies, the, so, called, halocline, in, which, both, salinity, and, temperature, rise, with, increasing, depth, because, of, its, relative, isolation, from, other, oceans, the, arctic, ocean, has, a, uniquely, complex, system, of, water, flow, it, resembles, some, hydrological, features, of, the, mediterranean, sea, referring, to, its, deep, waters, having, only, limited, communication, through, the, fram, strait, with, the, atlantic, basin, where, the, circulation, is, dominated, by, thermohaline, forcing, the, arctic, ocean, has, a, total, volume, of, 18, 07, 10, 6, km, 3, equal, to, about, 1, 3, of, the, world, ocean, mean, surface, circulation, is, predominantly, cyclonic, on, the, eurasian, side, and, anticyclonic, in, the, canadian, basin, water, enters, from, both, the, pacific, and, atlantic, oceans, and, can, be, divided, into, three, unique, water, masses, the, deepest, water, mass, is, called, arctic, bottom, water, and, begins, around, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, depth, it, is, composed, of, the, densest, water, in, the, world, ocean, and, has, two, main, sources, arctic, shelf, water, and, greenland, sea, deep, water, water, in, the, shelf, region, that, begins, as, inflow, from, the, pacific, passes, through, the, narrow, bering, strait, at, an, average, rate, of, 0, 8, sverdrups, and, reaches, the, chukchi, sea, during, the, winter, cold, alaskan, winds, blow, over, the, chukchi, sea, freezing, the, surface, water, and, pushing, this, newly, formed, ice, out, to, the, pacific, the, speed, of, the, ice, drift, is, roughly, 1, 4, cm, s, this, process, leaves, dense, salty, waters, in, the, sea, that, sink, over, the, continental, shelf, into, the, western, arctic, ocean, and, create, a, halocline, this, water, is, met, by, greenland, sea, deep, water, which, forms, during, the, passage, of, winter, storms, as, temperatures, cool, dramatically, in, the, winter, ice, forms, and, intense, vertical, convection, allows, the, water, to, become, dense, enough, to, sink, below, the, warm, saline, water, below, arctic, bottom, water, is, critically, important, because, of, its, outflow, which, contributes, to, the, formation, of, atlantic, deep, water, the, overturning, of, this, water, plays, a, key, role, in, global, circulation, and, the, moderation, of, climate, in, the, depth, range, of, 150, 900, m, 490, 2, 950, ft, is, a, water, mass, referred, to, as, atlantic, water, inflow, from, the, north, atlantic, current, enters, through, the, fram, strait, cooling, and, sinking, to, form, the, deepest, layer, of, the, halocline, where, it, circles, the, arctic, basin, counter, clockwise, this, is, the, highest, volumetric, inflow, to, the, arctic, ocean, equalling, about, 10, times, that, of, the, pacific, inflow, and, it, creates, the, arctic, ocean, boundary, current, it, flows, slowly, at, about, 0, 02, m, s, atlantic, water, has, the, same, salinity, as, arctic, bottom, water, but, is, much, warmer, up, to, 3, c, in, fact, this, water, mass, is, actually, warmer, than, the, surface, water, and, remains, submerged, only, due, to, the, role, of, salinity, in, density, when, water, reaches, the, basin, it, is, pushed, by, strong, winds, into, a, large, circular, current, called, the, beaufort, gyre, water, in, the, beaufort, gyre, is, far, less, saline, than, that, of, the, chukchi, sea, due, to, inflow, from, large, canadian, and, siberian, rivers, the, final, defined, water, mass, in, the, arctic, ocean, is, called, arctic, surface, water, and, is, found, in, the, depth, range, of, 150, 200, m, 490, 660, ft, the, most, important, feature, of, this, water, mass, is, a, section, referred, to, as, the, sub, surface, layer, it, is, a, product, of, atlantic, water, that, enters, through, canyons, and, is, subjected, to, intense, mixing, on, the, siberian, shelf, as, it, is, entrained, it, cools, and, acts, a, heat, shield, for, the, surface, layer, on, account, of, weak, mixing, between, layers, however, over, the, past, couple, of, decades, a, combination, of, the, warming, and, the, shoaling, of, atlantic, water, are, leading, to, the, increasing, influence, of, atlantic, water, heat, in, melting, sea, ice, in, the, eastern, arctic, the, most, recent, estimates, for, 2016, 2018, indicate, the, oceanic, heat, flux, to, the, surface, has, now, overtaken, the, atmospheric, flux, in, the, eastern, eurasian, basin, over, the, same, period, the, weakening, halocline, stratification, has, coincided, with, increasing, upper, ocean, currents, thought, to, be, associated, with, declining, sea, ice, indicate, increasing, mixing, in, this, region, in, contrast, direct, measurements, of, mixing, in, the, western, arctic, indicate, the, atlantic, water, heat, remains, isolated, at, intermediate, depths, even, under, the, perfect, storm, conditions, of, the, great, arctic, cyclone, of, 2012, waters, originating, in, the, pacific, and, atlantic, both, exit, through, the, fram, strait, between, greenland, and, svalbard, island, which, is, about, 2, 700, m, 8, 900, ft, deep, and, 350, km, 220, mi, wide, this, outflow, is, about, 9, sv, the, width, of, the, fram, strait, is, what, allows, for, both, inflow, and, outflow, on, the, atlantic, side, of, the, arctic, ocean, because, of, this, it, is, influenced, by, the, coriolis, force, which, concentrates, outflow, to, the, east, greenland, current, on, the, western, side, and, inflow, to, the, norwegian, current, on, the, eastern, side, pacific, water, also, exits, along, the, west, coast, of, greenland, and, the, hudson, strait, 1, 2, sv, providing, nutrients, to, the, canadian, archipelago, as, noted, the, process, of, ice, formation, and, movement, is, a, key, driver, in, arctic, ocean, circulation, and, the, formation, of, water, masses, with, this, dependence, the, arctic, ocean, experiences, variations, due, to, seasonal, changes, in, sea, ice, cover, sea, ice, movement, is, the, result, of, wind, forcing, which, is, related, to, a, number, of, meteorological, conditions, that, the, arctic, experiences, throughout, the, year, for, example, the, beaufort, high, an, extension, of, the, siberian, high, system, is, a, pressure, system, that, drives, the, anticyclonic, motion, of, the, beaufort, gyre, during, the, summer, this, area, of, high, pressure, is, pushed, out, closer, to, its, siberian, and, canadian, sides, in, addition, there, is, a, sea, level, pressure, slp, ridge, over, greenland, that, drives, strong, northerly, winds, through, the, fram, strait, facilitating, ice, export, in, the, summer, the, slp, contrast, is, smaller, producing, weaker, winds, a, final, example, of, seasonal, pressure, system, movement, is, the, low, pressure, system, that, exists, over, the, nordic, and, barents, seas, it, is, an, extension, of, the, icelandic, low, which, creates, cyclonic, ocean, circulation, in, this, area, the, low, shifts, to, centre, over, the, north, pole, in, the, summer, these, variations, in, the, arctic, all, contribute, to, ice, drift, reaching, its, weakest, point, during, the, summer, months, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, drift, is, associated, with, the, phase, of, the, arctic, oscillation, and, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, much, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, covered, by, sea, ice, that, varies, in, extent, and, thickness, seasonally, the, mean, extent, of, the, arctic, sea, ice, has, been, continuously, decreasing, in, the, last, decades, declining, at, a, rate, of, currently, 12, 85, per, decade, since, 1980, from, the, average, winter, value, of, 15, 600, 000, km, 2, 6, 023, 200, sq, mi, the, seasonal, variations, are, about, 7, 000, 000, km, 2, 2, 702, 700, sq, mi, with, the, maximum, in, april, and, minimum, in, september, the, sea, ice, is, affected, by, wind, and, ocean, currents, which, can, move, and, rotate, very, large, areas, of, ice, zones, of, compression, also, arise, where, the, ice, piles, up, to, form, pack, ice, icebergs, occasionally, break, away, from, northern, ellesmere, island, and, icebergs, are, formed, from, glaciers, in, western, greenland, and, extreme, northeastern, canada, icebergs, are, not, sea, ice, but, may, become, embedded, in, the, pack, ice, icebergs, pose, a, hazard, to, ships, of, which, the, titanic, is, one, of, the, most, famous, the, ocean, is, virtually, icelocked, from, october, to, june, and, the, superstructure, of, ships, are, subject, to, icing, from, october, to, may, before, the, advent, of, modern, icebreakers, ships, sailing, the, arctic, ocean, risked, being, trapped, or, crushed, by, sea, ice, although, the, baychimo, drifted, through, the, arctic, ocean, untended, for, decades, despite, these, hazards, the, arctic, ocean, is, contained, in, a, polar, climate, characterized, by, persistent, cold, and, relatively, narrow, annual, temperature, ranges, winters, are, characterized, by, the, polar, night, extreme, cold, frequent, low, level, temperature, inversions, and, stable, weather, conditions, cyclones, are, only, common, on, the, atlantic, side, summers, are, characterized, by, continuous, daylight, midnight, sun, and, air, temperatures, can, rise, slightly, above, 0, c, 32, f, cyclones, are, more, frequent, in, summer, and, may, bring, rain, or, snow, it, is, cloudy, year, round, with, mean, cloud, cover, ranging, from, 60, in, winter, to, over, 80, in, summer, the, temperature, of, the, surface, water, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, fairly, constant, at, approximately, 1, 8, c, 28, 8, f, near, the, freezing, point, of, seawater, the, density, of, sea, water, in, contrast, to, fresh, water, increases, as, it, nears, the, freezing, point, and, thus, it, tends, to, sink, it, is, generally, necessary, that, the, upper, 100, 150, m, 330, 490, ft, of, ocean, water, cools, to, the, freezing, point, for, sea, ice, to, form, in, the, winter, the, relatively, warm, ocean, water, exerts, a, moderating, influence, even, when, covered, by, ice, this, is, one, reason, why, the, arctic, does, not, experience, the, extreme, temperatures, seen, on, the, antarctic, continent, there, is, considerable, seasonal, variation, in, how, much, pack, ice, of, the, arctic, ice, pack, covers, the, arctic, ocean, much, of, the, arctic, ice, pack, is, also, covered, in, snow, for, about, 10, months, of, the, year, the, maximum, snow, cover, is, in, march, or, april, about, 20, 50, cm, 7, 9, 19, 7, in, over, the, frozen, ocean, the, climate, of, the, arctic, region, has, varied, significantly, during, the, earth, s, history, during, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, 55, million, years, ago, when, the, global, climate, underwent, a, warming, of, approximately, 5, 8, c, 9, 14, f, the, region, reached, an, average, annual, temperature, of, 10, 20, c, 50, 68, f, the, surface, waters, of, the, northernmost, arctic, ocean, warmed,

is, warming, twice, as, fast, as, the, rest, of, the, planet, due, to, the, pronounced, seasonality, of, 2, 6, months, of, midnight, sun, and, polar, night, in, the, arctic, ocean, the, primary, production, of, photosynthesizing, organisms, such, as, ice, algae, and, phytoplankton, is, limited, to, the, spring, and, summer, months, march, april, to, september, important, consumers, of, primary, producers, in, the, central, arctic, ocean, and, the, adjacent, shelf, seas, include, zooplankton, especially, copepods, calanus, finmarchicus, calanus, glacialis, and, calanus, hyperboreus, and, euphausiids, as, well, as, ice, associated, fauna, e, g, amphipods, these, primary, consumers, form, an, important, link, between, the, primary, producers, and, higher, trophic, levels, the, composition, of, higher, trophic, levels, in, the, arctic, ocean, varies, with, region, atlantic, side, vs, pacific, side, and, with, the, sea, ice, cover, secondary, consumers, in, the, barents, sea, an, atlantic, influenced, arctic, shelf, sea, are, mainly, sub, arctic, species, including, herring, young, cod, and, capelin, in, ice, covered, regions, of, the, central, arctic, ocean, polar, cod, is, a, central, predator, of, primary, consumers, the, apex, predators, in, the, arctic, ocean, marine, mammals, such, as, seals, whales, and, polar, bears, prey, upon, fish, endangered, marine, species, in, the, arctic, ocean, include, walruses, and, whales, the, area, has, a, fragile, ecosystem, and, it, is, especially, exposed, to, climate, change, because, it, warms, faster, than, the, rest, of, the, world, lion, s, mane, jellyfish, are, abundant, in, the, waters, of, the, arctic, and, the, banded, gunnel, is, the, only, species, of, gunnel, that, lives, in, the, ocean, petroleum,

zone, near, the, centre, of, the, sea, is, also, the, focus, of, a, mounting, dispute, between, the, united, states, russia, canada, norway, and, denmark, it, is, significant, for, the, global, energy, market, because, it, may, hold, 25, or, more, of, the, world, s, undiscovered, oil, and, gas, resources, the, arctic, ice, pack, is, thinning, and, a, seasonal, hole, in, the, ozone, layer, frequently, occurs, reduction, of, the, area, of, arctic, sea, ice, reduces, the, planet, s, average, albedo, possibly, resulting, in, global, warming, in, a, positive, feedback, mechanism, research, shows, that, the, arctic, may, become, ice, free, in, the, summer, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, by, 2040, estimates, vary, for, when, the, last, time, the, arctic, was, ice, free, 65, million, years, ago, when, fossils, indicate, that, plants, existed, there, to, as, recently, as, 5, 500, years, ago, ice, and, ocean, cores, going, back, 8, 000, years, to, the, last, warm, period, or, 125, 000, during, the, last, intraglacial, period, warming, temperatures, in, the, arctic, may, cause, large, amounts, of, fresh, melt, water, to, enter, the, north, atlantic, possibly, disrupting, global, ocean, current, patterns, potentially, severe, changes, in, the, earth, s, climate, might, then, ensue, as, the, extent, of, sea, ice, diminishes, and, sea, level, rises, the, effect, of, storms, such, as, the, great, arctic, cyclone, of, 2012, on, open, water, increases, as, does, possible, salt, water, damage, to, vegetation, on, shore, at, locations, such, as, the, mackenzie, delta, as, stronger, storm, surges, become, more, likely, global, warming, has, increased, encounters, between, polar, bears, and, humans, reduced, sea, ice, due, to, melting, is, causing, polar, bears, to, search, for, new, sources, of, food, beginning, in, december, 2018, and, coming, to, an, apex, in, february, 2019, a, mass, invasion, of, polar, bears, into, the, archipelago, of, novaya, zemlya, caused, local, authorities, to, declare, a, state, of, emergency, dozens, of, polar, bears, were, seen, entering, homes, public, buildings, and, inhabited, areas, sea, ice, and, the,
