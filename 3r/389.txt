americas, the, highest, outside, asia, and, the, highest, in, both, the, western, hemisphere, and, the, southern, hemisphere, with, a, summit, elevation, of, 6, 961, metres, 22, 838, ft, it, lies, 112, kilometres, 70, miles, northwest, of, the, provincial, capital, the, city, of, mendoza, about, five, kilometres, three, miles, from, san, juan, province, and, 15, km, 9, mi, from, argentina, s, border, with, chile, the, mountain, is, one, of, the, seven, summits, of, the, seven, continents, aconcagua, is, bounded, by, the, valle, de, las, vacas, to, the, north, and, east, and, the, valle, de, los, horcones, inferior, to, the, west, and, south, the, mountain, and, its, surroundings, are, part, of, the, aconcagua, provincial, park, the, mountain, has, a, number, of, glaciers, the, largest, glacier, is, the, ventisquero, horcones, inferior, at, about, 10, km, 6, mi, long, which, descends, from, the, south, face, to, about, 3, 600, m, 11, 800, ft, in, elevation, near, the, confluencia, camp, two, other, large, glacier, systems, are, the, ventisquero, de, las, vacas, sur, and, glaciar, este, ventisquero, relinchos, system, at, about, 5, km, 3, mi, long, the, best, known, is, the, northeastern, or, polish, glacier, as, it, is, a, common, route, of, ascent, the, origin, of, the, name, is, uncertain, it, may, be, from, the, mapudungun, aconca, hue, which, refers, to, the, aconcagua, river, and, means, comes, from, the, other, side, the, quechua, ackon, cahuak, meaning, sentinel, of, stone, the, quechua, anco, cahuac, meaning, white, sentinel, or, the, aymara, janq, u, q, awa, meaning, white, ravine, the, mountain, was, created, by, the, subduction, of, the, nazca, plate, beneath, the, south, american, plate, aconcagua, used, to, be, an, active, stratovolcano, from, the, late, cretaceous, or, early, paleocene, through, the, miocene, and, consisted, of, several, volcanic, complexes, on, the, edge, of, a, basin, with, a, shallow, sea, however, sometime, in, the, miocene, about, 8, to, 10, million, years, ago, the, subduction, angle, started, to, decrease, resulting, in, a, stop, of, the, melting, and, more, horizontal, stresses, between, the, oceanic, plate, and, the, continent, causing, the, thrust, faults, that, lifted, aconcagua, off, its, volcanic, root, the, rocks, on, aconcagua, s, flanks, are, all, volcanic, and, consist, of, lavas, breccias, and, pyroclastics, the, shallow, marine, basin, had, already, formed, earlier, triassic, even, before, aconcagua, arose, as, a, volcano, however, volcanism, has, been, present, in, this, region, for, as, long, as, this, basin, was, around, and, volcanic, deposits, interfinger, with, marine, deposits, throughout, the, sequence, the, colorful, greenish, bluish, and, grey, deposits, seen, in, the, horcones, valley, and, south, of, puente, del, inca, are, carbonates, limestones, turbidites, and, evaporates, that, filled, this, basin, the, red, colored, rocks, are, intrusions, cinder, deposits, and, conglomerates, of, volcanic, origin, in, mountaineering, terms, aconcagua, is, technically, an, easy, mountain, if, approached, from, the, north, via, the, normal, route, aconcagua, is, arguably, the, highest, non, technical, mountain, in, the, world, since, the, northern, route, does, not, absolutely, require, ropes, axes, and, pins, although, the, effects, of, altitude, are, severe, atmospheric, pressure, is, 40, of, sea, level, at, the, summit, the, use, of, supplemental, oxygen, is, not, common, altitude, sickness, will, affect, most, climbers, to, some, extent, depending, on, the, degree, of, acclimatization, although, the, normal, climb, is, technically, easy, multiple, casualties, occur, every, year, on, this, mountain, in, january, 2009, alone, five, climbers, died, this, is, due, to, the, large, numbers, of, climbers, who, attempt, and, because, many, climbers, underestimate, the, objective, risks, of, the, elevation, and, of, cold, weather, which, is, the, real, challenge, on, this, mountain, given, the, weather, conditions, close, to, the, summit, cold, weather, injuries, are, very, common, the, routes, to, the, peak, from, the, south, and, south, west, ridges, are, more, demanding, and, the, south, face, climb, is, considered, quite, difficult, the, polish, glacier, traverse, route, also, known, as, the, falso, de, los, polacos, route, crosses, through, the, vacas, valley, ascends, to, the, base, of, the, polish, glacier, then, traverses, across, to, the, normal, route, for, the, final, ascent, to, the, summit, the, third, most, popular, route, is, by, the, polish, glacier, itself, provincial, park, rangers, do, not, maintain, records, of, successful, summits, but, estimates, suggest, a, summit, rate, of, 30, 40, about, 75, of, climbers, are, foreigners, and, 25, are, argentinean, among, foreigners, the, united, states, leads, in, the, number, of, climbers, followed, by, germany, and, the, uk, about, 54, of, climbers, ascend, the, normal, route, 43, up, the, polish, glacier, traverse, route, and, the, remaining, 3, on, other, routes, the, campsites, on, the, normal, route, are, listed, below, elevations, are, approximate, summit, attempts, are, usually, made, from, a, high, camp, at, either, berl, n, or, colera, or, from, the, lower, camp, at, nido, de, c, ndores, the, first, attempt, to, summit, aconcagua, by, europeans, was, made, in, 1883, by, a, party, led, by, the, german, geologist, and, explorer, paul, g, ssfeldt, bribing, porters, with, the, story, of, treasure, on, the, mountain, he, approached, the, mountain, via, the, rio, volcan, making, two, attempts, on, the, peak, by, the, northwest, ridge, and, reaching, an, elevation, of, 6, 500, metres, 21, 300, ft, the, route, that, he, prospected, is, now, the, standard, route, up, the, mountain, the, first, recorded, ascent, was, in, 1897, by, a, european, expedition, led, by, the, british, mountaineer, edward, fitzgerald, fitzgerald, failed, to, reach, the, summit, himself, over, eight, attempts, between, december, 1896, and, february, 1897, but, the, swiss, guide, of, the, expedition, matthias, zurbriggen, reached, the, summit, on, 14, january, on, the, final, attempt, a, month, later, two, other, expedition, members, stuart, vines, and, nicola, lanti, reached, the, summit, on, 13, february, the, east, side, of, aconcagua, was, first, scaled, by, a, polish, expedition, with, konstanty, narkiewicz, jodko, stefan, daszy, ski, wiktor, ostrowski, and, stefan, osiecki, summiting, on, 8, march, 1934, over, what, is, now, known, as, the, polish, glacier, a, route, over, the, southwest, ridge, was, pioneered, over, seven, days, in, january, 1953, by, the, swiss, argentine, team, of, frederico, and, dorly, marmillod, francisco, ibanez, and, fernando, grajales, the, famously, difficult, south, face, was, conquered, by, a, french, team, led, by, ren, ferlet, pierre, lesueur, adrien, dagory, robert, paragot, edmond, denis, lucien, berardini, and, guy, poulet, reached, the, summit, after, a, month, of, effort, on, 25, february, 1954, as, of, 2020, the, youngest, person, to, reach, the, summit, of, aconcagua, is, tyler, armstrong, of, california, he, was, nine, years, old, when, he, reached, the, summit, on, 24, december, 2013, kaamya, karthikeyan, of, india, at, an, age, of, 12, became, the, youngest, girl, to, reach, the, summit, on, 1, february, 2020, the, oldest, person, to, climb, it, was, scott, lewis, who, reached, the, summit, on, 26, november, 2007, when, he, was, 87, years, old, in, the, base, camp, plaza, de, mulas, at, 4, 300, m, 14, 100, ft, above, sea, level, there, is, the, highest, contemporary, art, gallery, tent, called, nautilus, of, the, argentine, painter, miguel, doura, in, 2014, kilian, jornet, set, a, record, for, climbing, and, descending, aconcagua, from, horcones, in, 12, hours, and, 49, minutes, the, record, was, broken, less, than, two, months, later, by, ecuadorian, swiss, karl, egloff, in, a, time, of, 11, hours, 52, minutes, nearly, an, hour, faster, than, kilian, jornet, in, 2016, fernanda, maciel, set, the, first, women, record, for, climbing, and, descending, aconcagua, from, horcones, in, 22, hours, 52, minutes, the, current, women, s, record, is, held, by, ecuadorean, daniela, sandoval, at, 20, hours, 17, minutes, on, 25, september, 2019, an, airbus, helicopters, h145, landed, on, the, very, peak, of, mount, aconcagua, this, is, the, first, time, in, history, a, twin, engine, helicopter, has, landed, at, this, altitude, it, took, a, total, of, 45, minutes, for, the, entire, trip, 30, minutes, from, mendoza, and, another, 15, from, the, base, camp, up, to, the, peak, temperatures, were, reported, as, low, as, 22, c, 8, f, with, wind, gusts, up, to, 30, kn, 56, km, h, 35, mph, this, is, not, the, highest, a, helicopter, has, landed, before, as, a, single, engine, airbus, helicopters, h125, landed, on, mount, everest, the, highest, mountain, in, the, world, at, nearly, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, aconcagua, is, the, highest, peak, outside, of, asia, it, is, believed, to, have, the, highest, death, rate, of, any, mountain, in, south, america, around, three, a, year, which, has, earned, it, the, nickname, mountain, of, death, more, than, 100, people, have, died, on, aconcagua, since, records, began, due, to, the, improper, disposal, of, human, waste, in, the, mountain, environment, there, are, significant, health, hazards, that, pose, a, threat, to, both, animals, and, human, beings, only, boiled, or, chemically, treated, water, is, accepted, for, drinking, additionally, ecofriendly, toilets, are, available, only, to, members, of, an, organised, expedition, meaning, climbers, have, to, be, contracted, to, a, toilet, service, at, the, base, camp, and, similar, camps, along, the, route, as, of, 2015, from, two, base, camps, plaza, de, mulas, and, plaza, argentina, over, 120, barrels, of, waste, approx, 22, 500, kg, 49, 600, lb, are, flown, out, by, helicopter, each, season, in, addition, individual, mountaineers, must, make, a, payment, before, using, these, toilets, some, large, organisers, will, charge, up, to, us, 100, while, smaller, ones, may, charge, us, 5, per, day, or, us, 10, for, the, entire, stay, thus, many, independent, mountaineers, choose, to, defecate, on, the, mountainside, for, the, incas, aconcagua, was, a, sacred, mountain, as, on, other, mountains, e, g, ampato, places, of, worship, were, built, here, and, sacrifices, including, human, sacrifices, were, made, the, sites, discovered, in, 1985, at, an, elevation, of, 5167, m, are, among, the, highest, in, the, world, and, are, the, most, difficult, of, all, inca, sites, to, reach, here, the, remains, of, a, child, bedded, on, grass, cloth, and, feathers, were, found, inside, stone, walls, aconcagua, mummy, the, clothing, indicates, that, the, child, was, a, member, of, the, highest, social, class,
