a, religious, administrative, community, called, the, rum, millet, which, governed, all, orthodox, christians, regardless, of, their, ethnicity, most, of, the, local, population, then, gradually, lost, its, distinct, national, consciousness, identifying, only, by, its, faith, the, clergy, remaining, in, some, isolated, monasteries, kept, their, ethnic, identity, alive, enabling, its, survival,

rebellion, in, 1689, the, russian, empire, also, asserted, itself, as, a, protector, of, christians, in, ottoman, lands, with, the, treaty, of, k, k, kaynarca, in, 1774, the, western, european, enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, influenced, the, initiation, of, a, national, awakening, of, bulgaria, it, restored, national, consciousness, and, provided, an, ideological, basis, for, the,

great, powers, to, take, action, they, convened, the, constantinople, conference, in, 1876, but, their, decisions, were, rejected, by, the, ottomans, this, allowed, the, russian, empire, to, seek, a, military, solution, without, risking, confrontation, with, other, great, powers, as, had, happened, in, the, crimean, war, in, 1877, russia, declared, war, on, the, ottomans, and, defeated, them, with, the, help, of, bulgarian, rebels, particularly, during, the, crucial, battle, of, shipka, pass, which, secured, russian, control, over, the, main, road, to, constantinople, the, treaty, of, san,

the, territories, of, the, second, bulgarian, empire, and, this, day, is, now, a, public, holiday, called, national, liberation, day, the, other, great, powers, immediately, rejected, the, treaty, out, of, fear, that, such, a, large, country, in, the, balkans, might, threaten, their, interests, it, was, superseded, by, the, treaty, of, berlin, signed, on, 13, july, it, provided, for, a, much, smaller, state, the, principality, of, bulgaria, only, comprising, moesia, and, the, region, of, sofia, and, leaving, large, populations, of, ethnic, bulgarians, outside, the, new, country, this, significantly, contributed, to, bulgaria, s, militaristic, foreign, affairs, approach, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, bulgarian, principality, won, a, war, against, serbia, and, incorporated, the, semi, autonomous, ottoman, territory, of, eastern, rumelia, in, 1885, proclaiming, itself, an, independent, state, on, 5, october, 1908, in, the, years, following,
