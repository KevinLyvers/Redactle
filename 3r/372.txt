the, ethiopian, highlands, also, called, the, abyssinian, highlands, is, a, rugged, mass, of, mountains, in, ethiopia, in, northeast, africa, it, forms, the, largest, continuous, area, of, its, elevation, in, the, continent, with, little, of, its, surface, falling, below, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, while, the, summits, reach, heights, of, up, to, 4, 550, m, 14, 930, ft, it, is, sometimes, called, the, roof, of, africa, due, to, its, height, and, large, area, it, is, the, only, country, in, the, region, with, such, a, high, elevated, surface, this, elevated, surface, is, bisected, diagonally, by, the, great, east, african, rift, system, which, extends, from, syria, to, mozambique, across, the, east, african, lakes, most, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, are, part, of, central, and, northern, ethiopia, and, its, northernmost, portion, reaches, into, eritrea, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, once, was, located, the, kingdom, of, kaffa, a, medieval, and, early, modern, state, whence, the, coffee, plant, was, exported, to, the, arabian, peninsula, the, land, of, the, former, kingdom, is, mountainous, with, stretches, of, forest, the, land, is, very, fertile, capable, of, three, harvests, a, year, the, term, coffee, derives, from, the, arabic, qahwah, and, is, traced, to, kaffa, the, highlands, are, divided, into, northwestern, and, southeastern, portions, by, the, main, ethiopian, rift, which, contains, a, number, of, salt, lakes, the, northwestern, portion, known, as, the, abyssinian, massif, includes, the, semien, mountains, part, of, which, has, been, designated, the, simien, mountains, national, park, its, summit, ras, dashen, 4, 550, m, is, the, highest, peak, in, ethiopia, lake, tana, the, source, of, the, blue, nile, also, lies, in, the, northwestern, portion, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, southeastern, portion, is, known, as, the, harar, massif, its, bounded, in, the, west, by, the, fault, line, of, the, rift, valley, in, the, east, by, the, ogaden, lowlands, and, in, the, south, by, the, elkerie, and, borena, lowlands, its, highest, peaks, are, located, in, the, bale, zone, of, ethiopia, s, oromia, region, the, bale, mountains, also, designated, a, national, park, are, nearly, as, high, as, those, of, semien, it, is, the, main, source, of, the, wabishebelle, and, genalle, juba, the, range, includes, peaks, of, over, 4, 000, m, among, the, former, are, mount, tullu, demtu, 4, 337, m, which, is, the, second, highest, major, independent, mountain, in, ethiopia, and, mount, batu, 4, 307, m, most, of, the, country, s, major, cities, are, located, at, elevations, of, around, 2, 000, 2, 500, m, 6, 600, 8, 200, ft, above, sea, level, including, addis, ababa, ethiopia, s, capital, and, largest, city, and, historic, capitals, such, as, gondar, and, axum, the, ethiopian, highlands, began, to, rise, 75, million, years, ago, as, magma, from, the, earth, s, mantle, uplifted, a, broad, dome, of, the, ancient, rocks, of, the, arabian, nubian, shield, the, opening, of, the, great, rift, valley, split, the, dome, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, into, three, parts, the, mountains, of, the, southern, arabian, peninsula, are, geologically, part, of, the, ancient, ethiopian, highlands, separated, by, the, rifting, which, created, the, red, sea, and, gulf, of, aden, and, separated, africa, from, arabia, around, 30, million, years, ago, a, flood, basalt, plateau, began, to, form, piling, layers, upon, layers, of, voluminous, fissure, fed, basaltic, lava, flows, most, of, the, flows, were, tholeiitic, save, for, a, thin, layer, of, alkali, basalts, and, minor, amounts, of, felsic, high, silica, volcanic, rocks, such, as, rhyolite, in, the, waning, stages, of, the, flood, basalt, episode, large, explosive, caldera, forming, eruptions, also, occurred, the, ethiopian, highlands, were, eventually, bisected, by, the, great, rift, valley, as, the, african, continental, crust, pulled, apart, this, rifting, gave, rise, to, large, alkaline, basalt, shield, volcanoes, beginning, about, 30, 31, million, years, ago, the, northern, ethiopian, highlands, contain, four, discernible, planation, surfaces, the, oldest, one, being, formed, not, later, than, in, the, ordovician, period, the, youngest, surface, formed, in, the, cenozoic, being, partly, covered, by, the, ethiopia, yemen, continental, flood, basalts, contrary, to, what, has, been, suggested, for, much, of, africa, planation, surfaces, in, northern, ethiopia, do, not, appear, to, be, pediplains, nor, etchplains, spatial, distribution, of, temperature, in, ethiopia, is, determined, primarily, by, altitude, and, latitude, altitude, is, the, main, factor, that, determines, the, spatial, distribution, of, temperature, in, ethiopia, ethiopia, lies, within, the, tropics, a, zone, of, maximum, insolation, where, every, place, has, overhead, sun, twice, a, year, however, considerable, portions, of, ethiopia, are, highland, areas, and, their, altitudes, give, them, non, tropical, temperatures, ethiopia, s, tropical, climate, occur, in, lowlands, at, the, country, s, peripheries, the, predominant, climate, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, is, the, alpine, climate, because, the, highlands, elevate, ethiopia, located, close, to, the, equator, this, has, resulted, in, giving, this, country, an, unexpectedly, temperate, climate, further, these, mountains, catch, the, precipitation, of, the, monsoon, winds, of, the, indian, ocean, resulting, in, a, rainy, season, that, lasts, from, june, until, mid, september, these, heavy, rains, cause, the, nile, to, flood, in, the, summer, a, phenomenon, that, puzzled, the, ancient, greeks, as, the, summer, is, the, driest, season, in, the, mediterranean, climate, that, they, knew, the, ethiopian, highlands, share, a, similar, flora, and, fauna, to, other, mountainous, regions, of, africa, this, distinctive, flora, and, fauna, is, known, as, afromontane, but, from, the, time, of, the, last, ice, age, the, region, has, been, populated, with, some, eurasian, palearctic, flora, the, habitats, are, somewhat, different, on, either, side, of, the, great, rift, valley, which, splits, the, highlands, at, lower, elevations, the, highlands, are, surrounded, by, tropical, savannas, and, grasslands, including, the, sahelian, acacia, savanna, to, the, northwest, and, the, east, sudanian, savanna, to, the, west, the, highlands, themselves, are, divided, into, three, distinct, ecoregions, distinguished, by, elevation, the, ethiopian, montane, forests, lie, between, 1, 100, and, 1, 800, meters, elevation, above, the, lowland, grasslands, and, savannas, and, extend, to, areas, of, similar, habitat, in, eritrea, sudan, and, djibouti, this, woodland, belt, has, several, natural, plant, communities, but, has, mostly, been, heavily, grazed, and, converted, to, agricultural, use, now, kolla, is, an, open, woodland, found, at, lower, elevations, and, dominated, by, species, of, terminalia, commiphora, boswellia, and, acacia, weyna, dega, is, a, woodland, found, in, moister, and, higher, locations, dominated, by, the, conifers, afrocarpus, gracilior, and, juniperus, procera, the, lower, portion, of, the, harenna, forest, is, a, distinct, woodland, community, with, an, open, canopy, of, warburgia, ugandensis, croton, macrostachyus, syzygium, guineense, and, afrocarpus, gracilior, with, wild, coffee, coffea, arabica, as, the, dominant, understory, shrub, the, southwesterly, winds, bring, rainfall, from, may, to, october, with, moisture, from, the, red, sea, coming, in, from, the, east, year, round, fauna, at, these, elevations, includes, the, endemic, harwood, s, spurfowl, pternistis, harwoodi, prince, ruspoli, s, turaco, tauraco, ruspolii, and, yellow, throated, seedeater, serinus, flavigula, the, ethiopian, montane, grasslands, and, woodlands, is, the, largest, of, the, highland, ecoregions, occupying, the, area, between, 1, 800, and, 3, 000, meters, elevation, the, natural, vegetation, was, closed, canopy, forest, in, moister, areas, and, grassland, bushland, and, thicket, in, drier, areas, however, these, hillsides, have, good, fertile, soil, and, are, heavily, populated, largely, by, farming, communities, so, most, of, the, region, has, been, converted, to, agriculture, with, a, few, areas, of, natural, vegetation, remaining, urban, areas, in, this, ecoregion, include, ethiopia, s, capital, city, and, africa, s, fourth, largest, city, addis, ababa, the, amhara, region, capital, bahir, dar, with, its, island, monasteries, on, lake, tana, the, old, walled, city, of, harar, the, spa, town, of, ambo, asella, in, the, arsi, zone, the, trekking, center, of, dodola, the, lakeside, bishoftu, the, largest, city, in, the, southwest, jimma, the, market, town, of, nekemte, and, the, capital, of, the, tigray, region, mek, ele, awash, national, park, is, a, site, for, birdwatching, remaining, woodland, in, the, drier, areas, contains, much, endemic, flora, and, primarily, consists, of, the, conifers, afrocarpus, falcatus, and, juniperus, procera, often, with, the, broadleaved, hagenia, abyssinica, in, the, harenna, forest, pockets, of, moist, closed, canopy, forest, with, aningeria, and, olea, are, draped, with, lianas, and, epiphytes, while, above, 2400, meters, a, shrubby, zone, is, home, to, hagenia, astropanax, and, giant, lobelias, lobelia, gibberroa, species, which, can, be, found, on, the, east, african, mountains, further, south, the, evergreen, broadleaved, forest, of, the, semien, mountains, between, 2, 300, and, 2, 700, meters, elevation, is, dominated, by, syzygium, guineense, arundinarial, juniperus, procera, and, olea, africana, as, the, lower, slopes, of, the, mountains, are, so, heavily, populated, even, the, high, altitude, moorlands, are, affected, by, human, interference, such, as, the, grazing, of, livestock, and, even, farming, there, are, two, protected, areas, of, high, moorland, bale, mountains, national, park, in, the, southern, highlands, accessible, from, dinsho, and, simien, mountains, national, park, accessible, from, gondar, which, includes, ras, dashen, however, even, these, parks, are, losing, habitat, to, livestock, grazing, while, the, lower, elevation, parks, harar, wildlife, sanctuary, awash, national, park, omo, national, park, and, nechisar, national, park, are, even, less, secure, above, 3, 000, meters, elevation, lie, the, high, ethiopian, montane, moorlands, the, largest, afroalpine, region, in, africa, the, montane, moorlands, lie, above, the, tree, line, and, consist, of, grassland, and, moorland, with, abundant, herbs, and, some, shrubs, that, have, adapted, to, the, high, mountain, conditions, in, ethiopia, afro, alpine, and, sub, afro, alpine, vegetations, are, found, in, the, highlands, of, semein, and, highlands, of, bale, these, slopes, are, home, to, a, number, of, endemic, wildlife, species, including, the, endangered, walia, ibex, capra, walie, and, the, gelada, baboon, whose, thick, fur, allows, it, to, thrive, in, the, cooler, climates, of, the, mountains, these, two, species, are, only, found, on, the, northern, side, of, the, valley, while, another, rare, endemic, the, mountain, nyala, tragelaphus, buxtoni, is, restricted, to, the, southern, side, and, now, survives, at, higher, altitudes, than, its, original, habitat, since, the, lower, slopes, are, heavily, farmed, more, widespread, mammals, found, here, include, the, mantled, guereza, colobus, guereza, which, is, also, threatened, as, its, habitat, disappears, as, does, that, of, many, other, mammals, of, the, highlands, such, as, olive, baboon, papio, anubis, egyptian, wolf, canis, aureus, leopard, panthera, pardus, lion, panthera, leo, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, caracal, caracal, caracal, serval, leptailurus, serval, common, duiker,

ayresi, and, blue, winged, goose, the, farmland, is, home, to, many, butterflies, especially, papilio, charaxinae, pieridae, and, lycaenidae, there, are, several, endemic, animal, species, one, of, which, the, ethiopian, wolf, canis, simensis, is, critically, endangered, other, endemics, include, the, big, headed, mole, rat, tachyoryctes, macrocephalus, which, is, common, on, the, sanetti, plateau, in, the, bale, mountains, the, mountain, nyala, finds, its, way, up, to, the, high, moorlands, although, it, is, more, common, at, lower, elevations, wintering, birds, include, wigeon, anas, penelope, shoveler, anas, clypeata, ruff, philomachus, pugnax, and, greenshank, tringa, nebularia, other, fauna, in, the, area, also, includes, aardvark, eagle, egyptian, wolf, gelada, secretarybird, nubian, ibex, and, marabou, stork, and, ethiopian, endemic, species, such, as, the, shrew, crocidura, harenna, the, narrow, footed, woodland, mouse, grammomys, minnae, and, menelik, s, bushbuck, tragelaphus, scriptus, meneliki, which, is, a, subspecies, with, long, dark, fur, 12, 32, 00, n, 41, 23, 8, e, 12, 53333, n, 41, 38556, e, 12, 53333, 41, 38556
