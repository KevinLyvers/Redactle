further, development, continued, until, the, return, of, poland, s, independence, following, the, first, world, war, early, modernist, style, in, krak, w, is, represented, by, such, masterpieces, as, the, palace, of, art, by, franciszek, m, czy, ski, and, the, house, under, the, globe, secession, style, architecture, which, had, arrived, in, krak, w, from, vienna, became, popular, towards, the,

countries, of, the, eastern, bloc, was, enforced, from, 1949, to, 1956, it, involved, all, domains, of, art, but, its, most, spectacular, achievements, were, made, in, the, field, of, urban, design,

architecture, was, implemented, in, the, new, industrial, district, of, nowa, huta, with, apartment, blocks, constructed, according, to, a, stalinist, blueprint, with, repetitious, courtyards, and, wide, tree, lined, avenues, since, the, style, of, the, renaissance, was, generally, regarded, as, the, most, revered, in, old, polish, architecture, it, was, also, used, for, augmenting, poland, s, socialist, national, format, however, in, the, course, of, incorporating, the, principles, of, socialist, realism, there, were, quite, a, few, deviations, introduced, by, the, communists, from, 1953, critical, opinions, in, the, party, were, increasingly, frequent, and, the, doctrine, was, given, up, in, 1956, marking, the, end, of, stalinism, the, soc, realist, centre, of, nowa, huta, is, considered, to, be, a, meritorious, monument, of, the, times, this, period, in, postwar, architecture, was, followed, by, the, mass, construction, of, large, panel, system, apartment, blocks, most,
