the, elbe, german, czech, labe, low, german, ilv, or, elv, upper, and, lower, sorbian, objo, pronounced, is, one, of, the, major, rivers, of, central, europe, it, rises, in, the, giant, mountains, of, the, northern, czech, republic, before, traversing, much, of, bohemia, western, half, of, the, czech, republic, then, germany, and, flowing, into, the, north, sea, at, cuxhaven, 110, kilometres, 68, miles, northwest, of, hamburg, its, total, length, is, 1, 094, km, 680, mi, the, elbe, s, major, tributaries, include, the, rivers, vltava, saale, havel, mulde, schwarze, elster, and, oh, e, the, elbe, river, basin, comprising, the, elbe, and, its, tributaries, has, a, catchment, area, of, 148, 268, square, kilometres, 57, 247, sq, mi, the, twelfth, largest, in, europe, the, basin, spans, four, countries, however, it, lies, almost, entirely, just, in, two, of, them, germany, 65, 5, and, the, czech, republic, 33, 7, covering, about, two, thirds, of, the, nation, s, territory, on, its, southeastern, edges, the, elbe, river, basin, also, comprises, small, parts, of, austria, 0, 6, and, poland, 0, 2, the, elbe, catchment, area, is, inhabited, by, 24, 4, million, people, its, biggest, cities, are, berlin, hamburg, prague, dresden, and, leipzig, first, attested, in, latin, as, albis, the, name, elbe, means, river, or, river, bed, and, is, nothing, more, than, the, high, german, version, of, a, word, alb, found, elsewhere, in, germanic, cf, old, norse, river, name, elfr, swedish, lv, river, norwegian, elv, river, old, english, river, name, elf, and, middle, low, german, elve, river, bed, the, elbe, labe, rises, on, the, slopes, of, mt, viol, k, at, an, elevation, of, 1, 386, metres, 4, 547, ft, in, the, giant, mountains, on, the, northwest, borders, of, the, czech, republic, of, the, numerous, small, streams, whose, waters, compose, the, infant, river, after, plunging, down, the, 30, metres, 98, ft, of, the, elbe, falls, the, latter, stream, unites, with, the, steeply, torrential, b, l, labe, and, thereafter, the, united, stream, of, the, elbe, pursues, a, southerly, course, emerging, from, the, mountain, glens, at, jarom, where, it, receives, pa, and, metuje, here, the, elbe, enters, the, vast, vale, named, polab, meaning, land, along, the, elbe, and, continues, on, southwards, through, hradec, kr, lov, where, orlice, flows, in, and, then, to, pardubice, where, it, turns, sharply, to, the, west, at, kol, n, some, 43, kilometres, 27, mi, further, on, it, bends, gradually, towards, the, north, west, at, the, village, of, k, ran, a, little, above, brand, s, nad, labem, the, jizera, enters, in, at, m, ln, k, its, stream, is, more, than, doubled, in, volume, by, the, vltava, a, major, river, which, winds, northwards, through, bohemia, upstream, from, the, confluence, the, vltava, is, in, fact, much, longer, 434, kilometres, 270, mi, against, 294, kilometres, 183, mi, of, the, elbe, so, far, and, has, a, greater, discharge, and, a, larger, drainage, basin, nonetheless, for, historical, reasons, the, river, retains, the, name, elbe, also, because, at, the, confluence, point, it, is, the, elbe, that, flows, through, the, main, wider, valley, while, the, vltava, flows, into, the, valley, to, meet, the, elbe, at, almost, a, right, angle, and, thus, appears, to, be, the, tributary, river, some, distance, lower, down, at, litom, ice, the, waters, of, the, elbe, are, tinted, by, the, reddish, oh, e, thus, augmented, and, swollen, into, a, stream, 140, metres, 460, ft, wide, the, elbe, carves, a, path, through, the, basaltic, mass, of, the, esk, st, edoho, churning, its, way, through, a, picturesque, deep, narrow, and, curved, rocky, gorge, shortly, after, crossing, the, czech, german, frontier, and, passing, through, the, sandstone, defiles, of, the, elbe, sandstone, mountains, the, stream, assumes, a, north, westerly, direction, which, on, the, whole, it, preserves, right, to, the, north, sea, the, river, rolls, through, dresden, and, finally, beyond, meissen, enters, on, its, long, journey, across, the, north, german, plain, passing, along, the, former, western, border, of, east, germany, touching, torgau, wittenberg, dessau, magdeburg, wittenberge, and, hamburg, on, the, way, and, taking, on, the, waters, of, the, mulde, and, saale, from, the, west, and, those, of, the, schwarze, elster, havel, and, elde, from, the, east, in, its, northern, section, both, banks, of, the, elbe, are, characterised, by, flat, very, fertile, marshlands, elbe, marshes, former, flood, plains, of, the, elbe, now, diked, at, magdeburg, there, is, a, viaduct, the, magdeburg, water, bridge, that, carries, a, canal, and, its, shipping, traffic, over, the, elbe, and, its, banks, allowing, shipping, traffic, to, pass, under, it, unhindered, from, the, sluice, of, geesthacht, at, kilometre, 586, on, downstream, the, elbe, is, subject, to, the, tides, the, tidal, elbe, section, is, called, the, unterelbe, low, elbe, soon, the, elbe, reaches, hamburg, within, the, city, state, the, unterelbe, has, a, number, of, branch, streams, such, as, dove, elbe, gose, elbe, k, hlbrand, norderelbe, northern, elbe, reiherstieg, s, derelbe, southern, elbe, some, of, which, have, been, disconnected, for, vessels, from, the, main, stream, by, dikes, in, 1390, the, gose, elbe, literally, in, english, shallow, elbe, was, separated, from, the, main, stream, by, a, dike, connecting, the, two, then, islands, of, kirchwerder, and, neuengamme, the, dove, elbe, literally, in, english, deaf, elbe, was, diked, off, in, 1437, 38, at, gammer, ort, these, hydraulic, engineering, works, were, carried, out, to, protect, marshlands, from, inundation, and, to, improve, the, water, supply, of, the, port, of, hamburg, after, the, heavy, inundation, by, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1962, the, western, section, of, the, southern, elbe, was, separated, becoming, the, old, southern, elbe, while, the, waters, of, the, eastern, southern, elbe, now, merge, into, the, k, hlbrand, which, is, bridged, by, the, k, hlbrandbr, cke, the, last, bridge, over, the, elbe, before, the, north, sea, the, northern, elbe, passes, the, elbe, philharmonic, hall, and, is, then, crossed, under, by, the, old, elbe, tunnel, alter, elbtunnel, both, in, hamburg, s, city, centre, a, bit, more, downstream, the, low, elbe, s, two, main, anabranches, northern, elbe, and, the, k, hlbrand, reunite, south, of, altona, altstadt, a, locality, of, hamburg, right, after, both, anabranches, reunited, the, low, elbe, is, passed, under, by, the, new, elbe, tunnel, neuer, elbtunnel, the, last, structural, road, link, crossing, the, river, before, the, north, sea, at, the, bay, m, hlenberger, loch, in, hamburg, at, kilometre, 634, the, northern, elbe, and, the, southern, elbe, here, now, the, cut, off, meander, old, southern, elbe, used, to, reunite, which, is, why, the, bay, is, seen, as, the, starting, point, of, the, niederelbe, lower, elbe, leaving, the, city, state, the, lower, elbe, then, passes, between, holstein, and, the, elbe, weser, triangle, with, stade, until, it, flows, into, the, north, sea, at, cuxhaven, near, its, mouth, it, passes, the, entrance, to, the, kiel, canal, at, brunsb, ttel, before, it, debouches, into, the, north, sea, the, elbe, has, always, been, navigable, by, commercial, vessels, and, provides, important, trade, links, as, far, inland, as, prague, the, river, is, linked, by, canals, elbe, lateral, canal, elbe, havel, canal, mittellandkanal, to, the, industrial, areas, of, germany, and, to, berlin, the, elbe, l, beck, canal, links, the, elbe, to, the, baltic, sea, as, does, the, kiel, canal, whose, western, entrance, is, near, the, mouth, of, the, elbe, the, elbe,

ending, in, 2028, since, 1993, the, czech, republic, holds, the, former, czechoslovak, legal, position, before, germany, was, reunited, waterway, transport, in, western, germany, was, hindered, by, the, fact, that, inland, navigation, to, hamburg, had, to, pass, through, the, german, democratic, republic, the, elbe, seitenkanal, elbe, lateral, canal, was, built, between, the, west, german, section, of, the, mittellandkanal, and, the, lower, elbe, to, restore, this, connection, when, the, two, nations, were, reunited, works, were, begun, to, improve, and, restore, the, original, links, the, magdeburg, water, bridge, now, allows, large, barges, to, cross, the, elbe, without, having, to, enter, the, river, the, often, low, water, levels, of, the, elbe, no, longer, hinder, navigation, to, berlin, the, elbe, is, crossed, by, many, ferries, both, passenger, and, car, carrying, in, downstream, order, these, include, many, of, these, ferries, are, traditional, reaction, ferries, a, type, of, cable, ferry, that, uses, the, current, flow, of, the, river, to, provide, propulsion, humans, first, lived, in, the, northern, elbe, region, before, about, 200, 000, years, ago, during, the, middle, paleolithic, ptolemy, recorded, the, elbe, as, albis, germanic, for, river, in, germania, magna, with, its, source, in, the, asciburgis, mountains, giant, mountains, where, the, germanic, vandalii, then, lived, the, elbe, has, long, served, as, an, important, delineator, of, european, geography, the, romans, knew, the, river, as, the, albis, however, they, made, only, one, serious, attempt, to, move, the, border, of, their, empire, forward, from, the, rhine, to, the, elbe, and, this, attempt, failed, with, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, in, 9, ad, after, which, they, never, seriously, tried, again, in, the, middle, ages, the, elbe, formed, the, eastern, limit, of, the, empire, of, charlemagne, king, of, the, franks, from, 769, to, 814, the, river, s, navigable, sections, were, essential, to, the, success, of, the, hanseatic, league, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, much, trade, was, carried, on, its, waters, from, the, early, 6th, century, slavic, tribes, known, as, the, polabian, slavs, settled, in, the, areas, east, of, the, rivers, elbe, and, saale, which, had, been, depopulated, since, the, 4th, century, in, the, 10th, century, the, ottonian, dynasty, dominant, from, 919, to, 1024, began, conquering, these, lands, a, slow, process, of, germanization, ensued, including, the, wendish, crusade, of, 1147, the, elbe, delineated, the, western, parts, of, germany, from, the, eastern, so, called, east, elbia, where, soccage, and, serfdom, were, more, strict, and, prevailed, longer, than, westwards, of, the, river, and, where, feudal, lords, held, bigger, estates, than, in, the, west, thus, incumbents, of, huge, land, holdings, became, characterised, as, east, elbian, junkers, the, northern, german, area, north, of, the, lower, elbe, used, to, be, called, north, albingia, in, the, middle, ages, when, the, four, lutheran, church, bodies, there, united, in, 1977, they, chose, the, name, north, elbian, evangelical, lutheran, church,
