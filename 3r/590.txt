derived, from, the, arawak, name, for, hummingbird, ier, tt, or, yerett, however, other, authors, dispute, this, etymology, with, some, claiming, that, cairi, does, not, mean, hummingbird, tukusi, or,

the, trinity, fulfilling, a, vow, made, before, setting, out, on, his, third, voyage, of, exploration, tobago, s, cigar, like, shape, or, the, use, of, tobacco, by, the, native, people, may, have,

pronunciation, is, t, be, o, indo, trinidadians, called, the, island, chinidat, or, chinidad, which, translated, to, the, land, of, sugar, the, usage, of, the, term, goes, back, to, the, 19th, century, when, recruiters, in, india, would, call, the, island, chinidat, as, a, way, of, luring, workers, into, indentureship, on, the, sugar, plantations, the, islands, that, make, up, modern, day, trinidad, and, tobago, lie, at, the, southern, end, of, the, lesser, antilles, group, both, trinidad, and, tobago, were, originally, settled, by, indigenous, people, who, came, through, south, america, trinidad, was, first, settled, by, pre, agricultural, archaic, people, at, least, 7, 000, years, ago, making, it, the, earliest, settled, part, of, the, caribbean, banwari, trace, in, south, west, trinidad, is, the, oldest, attested, archaeological, site, in, the, caribbean, dating, to, about, 5000, bc, several, waves, of, migration, occurred, over, the, following, centuries, which, can, be, identified, by, differences, in, their, archaeological, remains, at, the, time, of, european, contact, trinidad, was, occupied, by, various, arawakan, speaking, groups, including, the, nepoya, and, suppoya, and, cariban, speaking, groups, such, as, the, yao, while, tobago, was, occupied, by, the, island, caribs, and, galibi, christopher, columbus, was, the, first, european, to, see, trinidad, on, his, third, voyage, to, the, americas, in, 1498, he, also, reported, seeing, tobago, on, the, distant, horizon, naming, it, bellaforma, but, did, not, land, on, the, island, in, the, 1530s, antonio, de, sede, o, a, spanish, soldier, intent, on, conquering, the, island, of, trinidad, landed, on, its, southwest, coast, with, a, small, army, of, men, intending, to, subdue, the, indigenous, population, of, the, island, sede, o, and, his, men, fought, the, native, peoples, on, many, occasions, and, subsequently, built, a, fort, the, next, few, decades, were, generally, spent, in, warfare, with, the, native, peoples, until, in, 1592, the, cacique, native, chief, wannawanare, also, known, as, guanaguanare, granted, the, area, around, modern, saint, joseph, to, domingo, de, vera, e, ibarg, en, and, withdrew, to, another, part, of, the, island, the, settlement, of, san, jos, de, oru, a, was, later, established, by, antonio, de, berr, o, on, this, land, in, 1592, shortly, thereafter, the, english, sailor, sir, walter, raleigh, arrived, in, trinidad, on, 22, march, 1595, in, search, of, the, long, rumoured, el, dorado, city, of, gold, supposedly, located, in, south, america, he, attacked, san, jos, captured, and, interrogated, antonio, de, berr, o, and, obtained, much, information, from, him, and, from, the, cacique, topiawari, raleigh, then, went, on, his, way, and, spanish, authority, was, restored, meanwhile, there, were, numerous, attempts, by, european, powers, to, settle, tobago, during, the, 1620, 40s, with, the, dutch, english, and, couronians, people, from, the, duchy, of, courland, and, semigallia, now, part, of, latvia, all, attempting, to, colonise, the, island, with, little, success, from, 1654, the, dutch, and, courlanders, managed, to, gain, a, more, secure, foothold, later, joined, by, several, hundred, french, settlers, a, plantation, economy, developed, based, on, the, production, of, sugar, indigo, and, rum, worked, by, large, numbers, of, african, slaves, who, soon, came, to, vastly, outnumber, the, european, colonists, large, numbers, of, forts, were, constructed, as, tobago, became, a, source, of, contention, between, france, netherlands, and, britain, with, the, island, changing, hands, some, 31, times, prior, to, 1814, a, situation, exacerbated, by, widespread, piracy, the, british, managed, to, hold, tobago, from, 1762, to, 1781, whereupon, it, was, captured, by, the, french, who, ruled, until, 1793, when, britain, re, captured, the, island, the, 17th, century, on, trinidad, passed, largely, without, major, incident, but, sustained, attempts, by, the, spaniards, to, control, and, rule, over, the, indigenous, population, was, often, fiercely, resisted, in, 1687, the, catholic, catalan, capuchin, friars, were, given, responsibility, for, the, conversions, of, the, indigenous, people, of, trinidad, and, the, guianas, they, founded, several, missions, in, trinidad, supported, and, richly, funded, by, the, state, which, also, granted, encomienda, right, to, them, over, the, native, peoples, in, which, the, native, peoples, were, forced, to, provide, labour, for, the, spanish, one, such, mission, was, santa, rosa, de, arima, established, in, 1689, when, indigenous, people, from, the, former, encomiendas, of, tacarigua, and, arauca, arouca, were, relocated, further, west, escalating, tensions, between, the, spaniards, and, indigenous, people, culminated, in, violence, in, 1689, when, indigenous, people, in, the, san, rafael, encomienda, rebelled, and, killed, several, priests, attacked, a, church, and, killed, the, spanish, governor, jos, de, le, n, y, echales, among, those, killed, in, the, governor, s, party, was, juan, mazien, de, sotomayor, missionary, priest, to, the, nepuyo, villages, of, caura, tacarigua, and, arauca, the, spanish, retaliated, severely, slaughtering, hundreds, of, native, peoples, in, an, event, that, became, known, as, the, arena, massacre, as, a, result, continuing, spanish, slave, raiding, and, the, devastating, impact, of, introduced, disease, to, which, they, had, no, immunity, the, native, population, was, virtually, wiped, out, by, the, end, of, the, following, century, during, this, period, trinidad, was, an, island, province, belonging, to, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, together, with, central, america, present, day, mexico, and, what, would, later, become, the, southwestern, united, states, in, 1757, the, capital, was, moved, from, san, jos, de, oru, a, to, puerto, de, espa, a, modern, port, of, spain, following, several, pirate, attacks, however, the, spanish, never, made, any, concerted, effort, to, colonise, the, islands, trinidad, in, this, period, was, still, mostly, forest, populated, by, a, few, spaniards, with, a, handful, of, slaves, and, a, few, thousand, indigenous, people, indeed, the, population, in, 1777, was, only, 1, 400, and, spanish, colonisation, in, trinidad, remained, tenuous, in, 1777, the, captain, general, luis, de, unzaga, le, conciliateur, married, to, a, french, creole, allowed, free, trade, in, trinidad, attracting, french, settlers, and, its, economy, improved, notably, since, trinidad, was, considered, underpopulated, roume, de, st, laurent, a, frenchman, living, in, grenada, was, able, to, obtain, a, c, dula, de, poblaci, n, from, the, spanish, king, charles, iii, on, 4, november, 1783, a, c, dula, de, poblaci, n, had, previously, been, granted, in, 1776, by, the, king, but, had, not, shown, results, and, therefore, the, new, c, dula, was, more, generous, it, granted, free, land, and, tax, exemption, for, 10, years, to, roman, catholic, foreign, settlers, who, were, willing, to, swear, allegiance, to, the, king, of, spain, the, land, grant, was, 30, fanegas, 13, hectares, 32, acres, for, each, free, man, woman, and, child, and, half, of, that, for, each, slave, that, they, brought, with, them, the, spanish, sent, a, new, governor, jos, mar, a, chac, n, to, implement, the, terms, of, the, new, c, dula, the, c, dula, was, issued, only, a, few, years, before, the, french, revolution, during, that, period, of, upheaval, french, planters, with, their, slaves, free, coloureds, and, mulattos, from, the, neighbouring, islands, of, martinique, saint, lucia, grenada, guadeloupe, and, dominica, migrated, to, trinidad, where, they, established, an, agriculture, based, economy, sugar, and, cocoa, these, new, immigrants, established, local, communities, in, blanchisseuse, champs, fleurs, paramin, cascade, carenage, and, laventille, as, a, result, trinidad, s, population, jumped, to, over, 15, 000, by, the, end, of, 1789, and, by, 1797, the, population, of, port, of, spain, had, increased, from, under, 3, 000, to, 10, 422, in, just, five, years, with, a, varied, population, of, mixed, race, individuals, spaniards, africans, french, republican, soldiers, retired, pirates, and, french, nobility, the, total, population, of, trinidad, was, 17, 718, of, which, 2, 151, were, of, european, ancestry, 4, 476, were, free, blacks, and, people, of, colour, 10, 009, were, enslaved, people, and, 1, 082, indigenous, people, the, sparse, settlement, and, slow, rate, of, population, increase, during, spanish, rule, and, even, later, during, british, rule, made, trinidad, one, of, the, less, populated, colonies, of, the, west, indies, with, the, least, developed, plantation, infrastructure, the, british, had, begun, to, take, a, keen, interest, in, trinidad, and, in, 1797, a, british, force, led, by, general, sir, ralph, abercromby, launched, an, invasion, of, trinidad, his, squadron, sailed, through, the, bocas, and, anchored, off, the, coast, of, chaguaramas, seriously, outnumbered, chac, n, decided, to, capitulate, to, the, british, without, fighting, trinidad, thus, became, a, british, crown, colony, with, a, largely, french, speaking, population, and, spanish, laws, british, rule, was, later, formalised, under, the, treaty, of, amiens, 1802, the, colony, s, first, british, governor, was, thomas, picton, however, his, heavy, handed, approach, to, enforcing, british, authority, including, the, use, of, torture, and, arbitrary, arrest, led, to, his, being, recalled, british, rule, led, to, an, influx, of, settlers, from, the, united, kingdom, and, the, british, colonies, of, the, eastern, caribbean, english, scots, irish, german, and, italian, families, arrived, as, well, as, some, free, blacks, known, as, merikins, who, had, fought, for, britain, in, the, war, of, 1812, and, were, granted, land, in, southern, trinidad, under, british, rule, new, states, were, created, and, the, importation, of, slaves, increased, however, by, this, time, support, for, abolitionism, had, vastly, increased, and, in, england, the, slave, trade, was, under, attack, slavery, was, abolished, in, 1833, after, which, former, slaves, served, an, apprenticeship, period, in, 1837, daaga, a, west, african, slave, trader, who, had, been, captured, by, portuguese, slavers, and, later, rescued, by, the, british, navy, was, conscripted, into, the, local, regiment, daaga, and, a, group, of, his, compatriots, mutinied, at, the, barracks, in, st, joseph, and, set, out, eastward, in, an, attempt, to, return, to, their, homeland, the, mutineers, were, ambushed, by, a, militia, unit, just, outside, the, town, of, arima, the, revolt, was, crushed, at, the, cost, of, some, 40, dead, and, daaga, and, his, party, were, later, executed, at, st, joseph, the, apprenticeship, system, ended, on, 1, august, 1838, with, full, emancipation, an, overview, of, the, population, statistics, in, 1838, however, clearly, reveals, the, contrast, between, trinidad, and, its, neighbouring, islands, upon, emancipation, of, the, slaves, in, 1838, trinidad, had, only, 17, 439, slaves, with, 80, of, slave, owners, having, enslaved, fewer, than, 10, people, each, in, contrast, at, twice, the, size, of, trinidad, jamaica, had, roughly, 360, 000, slaves, after, the, african, slaves, were, emancipated, many, refused, to, continue, working, on, the, plantations, often, moving, out, to, urban, areas, such, as, laventille, and, belmont, to, the, east, of, port, of, spain, as, a, result, a, severe, agricultural, labour, shortage, emerged, the, british, filled, this, gap, by, instituting, a, system, of, indentureship, various, nationalities, were, contracted, under, this, system, including, indians, chinese, and, portuguese, of, these, the, east, indians, were, imported, in, the, largest, numbers, starting, from, 1, may, 1845, when, 225, indians, were, brought, in, the, first, ship, to, trinidad, on, the, fatel, razack, a, muslim, owned, vessel, indentureship, of, the, indians, lasted, from, 1845, to, 1917, during, which, time, more, than, 147, 000, indians, came, to, trinidad, to, work, on, sugarcane, plantations, indentureship, contracts, were, sometimes, exploitative, to, such, an, extent, that, historians, such, as, hugh, tinker, were, to, call, it, a, new, system, of, slavery, despite, these, descriptions, it, was, not, truly, a, new, form, of, slavery, as, workers, were, paid, contracts, were, finite, and, the, idea, of, an, individual, being, another, s, property, had, been, eliminated, when, slavery, was, abolished, in, addition, employers, of, indentured, labour, had, no, legal, right, to, flog, or, whip, their, workers, the, main, legal, sanction, for, the, enforcement, of, the, indenture, laws, was, prosecution, in, the, courts, followed, by, fines, or, more, likely, jail, sentences, people, were, contracted, for, a, period, of, five, years, with, a, daily, wage, as, low, as, 25, cents, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, they, were, guaranteed, return, passage, to, india, at, the, end, of, their, contract, period, however, coercive, means, were, often, used, to, retain, labourers, and, the, indentureship, contracts, were, soon, extended, to, 10, years, from, 1854, after, the, planters, complained, that, they, were, losing, their, labour, too, early, in, lieu, of, the, return, passage, the, british, authorities, soon, began, offering, portions, of, land, to, encourage, settlement, and, by, 1902, more, than, half, of, the, sugar, cane, in, trinidad, was, being, produced, by, independent, cane, farmers, the, majority, of, which, were, indians, despite, the, trying, conditions, experienced, under, the, indenture, system, about, 90, of, the, indian, immigrants, chose, at, the, end, of, their, contracted, periods, of, indenture, to, make, trinidad, their, permanent, home, indians, entering, the, colony, were, also, subject, to, certain, crown, laws, which, segregated, them, from, the, rest, of, trinidad, and, tobago, s, population, such, as, the, requirement, that, they, carry, a, pass, with, them, if, they, left, the, plantations, and, that, if, freed, they, carry, their, free, papers, or, certificate, indicating, completion, of, the, indenture, period, few, indians, settled, on, tobago, however, and, the, descendants, of, african, slaves, continued, to, form, the, majority, of, the, island, s, population, an, ongoing, economic, slump, in, the, middle, to, late, 19th, century, caused, widespread, poverty, discontent, erupted, into, rioting, on, the, roxborough, plantation, in, 1876, in, an, event, known, as, the, belmanna, uprising, after, a, policeman, who, was, killed, the, british, eventually, managed, to, restore, control, however, as, a, result, of, the, disturbances, tobago, s, legislative, assembly, voted, to, dissolve, itself, and, the, island, became, a, crown, colony, in, 1877, with, the, sugar, industry, in, a, state, of, near, collapse, and, the, island, no, longer, profitable, the, british, attached, tobago, to, their, trinidad, colony, in, 1889, in, 1903, a, protest, against, the, introduction, of, new, water, rates, in, port, of, spain, erupted, into, rioting, 18, people, were, shot, dead, and, the, red, house, the, government, headquarters, was, damaged, by, fire, a, local, elected, assembly, with, some, limited, powers, was, introduced, in, 1913, economically, trinidad, and, tobago, remained, a, predominantly, agricultural, colony, alongside, sugarcane, the, cacao, cocoa, crop, also, contributed, greatly, to, economic, earnings, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, in, november, 1919, the, dockworkers, went, on, strike, over, bad, management, practices, low, wages, compared, to, a, higher, cost, of, living, strikebreakers, were, brought, in, to, keep, a, minimum, of, goods, moving, through, the, ports, on, 1, december, 1919, the, striking, dockworkers, rushed, the, harbour, and, chased, off, the, strikebreakers, they, then, proceeded, to, march, on, the, government, buildings, in, port, of, spain, other, unions, and, workers, many, with, the, same, grievances, joined, the, dock, worker, s, strike, making, it, a, general, strike, violence, broke, out, and, was, only, put, down, with, help, from, the, sailors, of, british, naval, ship, hms, calcutta, the, unity, brought, upon, by, the, strike, was, the, first, time, of, cooperation, between, the, various, ethnic, groups, of, the, time, historian, brinsley, samaroo, says, that, the, 1919, strikes, seem, to, indicate, that, there, was, a, growing, class, consciousness, after, the, war, and, this, transcended, racial, feelings, at, times, however, in, the, 1920s, the, collapse, of, the, sugarcane, industry, concomitant, with, the, failure, of, the, cocoa, industry, resulted, in, widespread, depression, among, the, rural, and, agricultural, workers, in, trinidad, and, encouraged, the, rise, of, a, labour, movement, conditions, on, the, islands, worsened, in, the, 1930s, with, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, with, an, outbreak, of, labour, riots, occurring, in, 1937, which, resulted, in, several, deaths, the, labour, movement, aimed, to, unite, the, urban, working, class, and, agricultural, labour, class, the, key, figures, being, arthur, cipriani, who, led, the, trinidad, labour, party, tlp, tubal, uriah, buzz, butler, of, the, british, empire, citizens, and, workers, home, rule, party, and, adrian, cola, rienzi, who, led, the, trinidad, citizens, league, tcl, oilfields, workers, trade, union, and, all, trinidad, sugar, estates, and, factory, workers, union, as, the, movement, developed, calls, for, greater, autonomy, from, british, colonial, rule, became, widespread, this, effort, was, severely, undermined, by, the, british, home, office, and, by, the, british, educated, trinidadian, elite, many, of, whom, were, descended, from, the, plantocracy, class, petroleum, had, been, discovered, in, 1857, but, became, economically, significant, only, in, the, 1930s, and, afterwards, as, a, result, of, the, collapse, of, sugarcane, and, cocoa, and, increasing, industrialization, by, the, 1950s, petroleum, had, become, a, staple, in, trinidad, s, export, market, and, was, responsible, for, a, growing, middle, class, among, all, sections, of, the, trinidad, population, the, collapse, of, trinidad, s, major, agricultural, commodities, followed, by, the, depression, and, the, rise, of, the, oil, economy, led, to, major, changes, in, the, country, s, social, structure, the, presence, of, american, military, bases, in, chaguaramas, and, cumuto, in, trinidad, during, world, war, ii, had, a, profound, effect, on, society, the, americans, vastly, improved, the, infrastructure, on, trinidad, and, provided, many, locals, with, well, paying, jobs, however, the, social, effects, of, having, so, many, young, soldiers, stationed, on, the, island, as, well, as, their, often, unconcealed, racial, prejudice, caused, resentment, the, americans, left, in, 1961, in, the, post, war, period, the, british, began, a, process, of, decolonisation, across, the, british, empire, in, 1945, universal, suffrage, was, introduced, to, trinidad, and, tobago, political, parties, emerged, on, the, island, however, these, were, largely, divided, along, racial, lines, afro, trinidadians, and, tobagonians, primarily, supported, the, people, s, national, movement, pnm, formed, in, 1956, by, eric, williams, with, indo, trinidadians, and, tobagonians, mostly, supporting, the, people, s, democratic, party, pdp, formed, in, 1953, by, bhadase, sagan, maraj, which, later, merged, into, the, democratic, labour, party, dlp, in, 1957, britain, s, caribbean, colonies, formed, the, west, indies, federation, in, 1958, as, a, vehicle, for, independence, however, the, federation, dissolved, after, jamaica, withdrew, following, a, membership, referendum, in, 1961, the, government, of, trinidad, and, tobago, subsequently, chose, to, seek, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, on, its, own, trinidad, and, tobago, gained, its, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, on, 31, august, 1962, however, elizabeth, ii, remained, head, of, state, represented, locally, by, governor, general, solomon, hochoy, until, the, passage, of, the, 1976, republican, constitution, eric, williams, of, the, people, s, national, movement, became, the, first, prime, minister, serving, in, that, capacity, uninterrupted, until, 1981, the, dominant, figure, in, the, opposition, in, the, early, independence, years, was, opposition, leader, rudranath, capildeo, of, the, democratic, labour, party, the, first, speaker, of, the, house, of, representatives, was, clytus, arnold, thomasos, and, the, first, president, of, the, senate, was, j, hamilton, maurice, the, 1960s, saw, the, rise, of, a, black, power, movement, inspired, in, part, by, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, protests, and, strikes, became, common, with, events, coming, to, head, in, april, 1970, when, police, shot, dead, a, protester, named, basil, davis, fearing, a, breakdown, of, law, and, order, prime, minister,
