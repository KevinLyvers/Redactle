the, yellow, river, is, the, second, longest, river, in, china, and, the, sixth, longest, river, system, on, earth, with, an, estimated, length, of, 5, 464, km, 3, 395, mi, and, a, watershed, of, 795, 000, km, 2, 307, 000, sq, mi, beginning, in, the, bayan, har, mountains, the, river, flows, generally, eastwards, before, entering, the, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, long, ordos, loop, which, runs, northeast, at, gansu, through, the, ordos, plateau, and, turns, east, in, inner, mongolia, the, river, then, turns, sharply, southwards, to, form, the, border, between, shanxi, and, shaanxi, turns, eastwards, at, its, confluence, with, the, wei, river, and, flows, across, the, north, china, plain, before, emptying, into, the, bohai, sea, the, river, is, named, for, the, yellow, color, of, its, water, which, comes, from, the, large, amount, of, sediment, discharged, into, the, water, as, the, river, flows, through, the, loess, plateau, the, yellow, river, basin, was, the, birthplace, of, ancient, chinese, civilization, according, to, traditional, chinese, historiography, the, xia, dynasty, originated, on, its, banks, around, 2100, bc, sima, qian, s, shiji, c, 91, bc, record, that, the, xia, were, founded, after, the, tribes, around, the, yellow, river, united, to, combat, the, frequent, floods, in, the, area, the, river, has, provided, fertile, soil, for, agriculture, but, since, then, has, flooded, and, changed, course, frequently, with, one, estimate, counting, 1, 593, floods, in, the, 2, 540, years, between, 595, bc, and, 1946, ad, as, such, the, yellow, river, has, been, considered, a, blessing, and, a, curse, throughout, history, and, has, been, nicknamed, both, china, s, pride, and, china, s, sorrow, the, yellow, river, s, basin, presently, has, a, population, of, 120, million, people, while, over, 420, million, people, live, in, the, immediate, provinces, which, rely, on, it, as, a, water, source, the, basin, comprises, 13, percent, of, china, s, cultivated, land, area, the, area, receives, very, uneven, rainfall, only, 2, percent, of, china, s, water, runoff, water, and, sediment, flow, has, decreased, five, fold, since, the, 1970s, and, until, recently, the, river, frequently, did, not, reach, the, sea, since, 2003, china, has, been, working, on, the, south, north, water, transfer, project, to, alleviate, the, strain, on, the, river, s, water, supply, when, the, yellow, river, was, still, somewhat, clear, it, was, simply, referred, to, as, the, river, old, chinese, g, i, observations, made, at, the, yumenkou, gorge, where, the, river, leaves, the, modern, loess, plateau, indicated, the, river, changed, to, muddy, sometime, between, 367, bc, and, 165, ad, according, to, chronicles, records, the, alternative, names, murky, river, dr, k, g, i, and, muddy, yellow, river, gw, g, i, were, attested, in, 145, bc, and, in, 429, ad, respectively, the, name, yellow, river, fully, replaces, murky, river, by, the, end, of, tang, dynasty, for, unclear, reasons, in, the, shaanxi, loess, plateau, it, is, referred, to, as, river, my, lord, in, the, jin, language, in, mongolian, it, is, called, ar, m, r, n, yellow, river, or, khatan, gol, queen, river, the, river, is, mentioned, in, the, kul, tigin, stele, as, the, green, river, old, turkic, ya, l, g, z, the, tibetan, name, is, river, of, the, peacock, tibetan, wylie, rma, chu, thl, ma, chu, m, q, the, yellow, river, first, formed, sometime, during, the, late, miocene, pliocene, or, pleistocene, as, a, result, of, the, tibetan, plateau, being, uplifted, the, river, has, long, been, critical, to, the, development, of, northern, china, and, is, regarded, by, scholars, as, a, cradle, of, civilization, flooding, of, the, river, has, also, caused, much, destruction, including, multiple, floods, that, have, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, over, one, million, people, among, the, deadliest, were, the, 1332, 33, flood, during, the, yuan, dynasty, the, 1887, flood, during, the, qing, dynasty, which, killed, anywhere, from, 900, 000, to, 2, million, people, and, a, republic, of, china, era, 1931, flood, part, of, a, massive, number, of, floods, that, year, that, killed, 1, 4, million, people, the, cause, of, the, floods, is, the, large, amount, of, fine, grained, loess, carried, by, the, river, from, the, loess, plateau, which, is, continuously, deposited, along, the, bottom, of, its, channel, the, sedimentation, causes, natural, dams, to, slowly, accumulate, these, subaqueous, dams, are, unpredictable, and, generally, undetectable, eventually, the, enormous, amount, of, water, needs, to, find, a, new, way, to, the, sea, forcing, it, to, take, the, path, of, least, resistance, when, this, happens, it, bursts, out, across, the, flat, north, china, plain, sometimes, taking, a, new, channel, and, inundating, most, farmland, cities, or, towns, in, its, path, the, traditional, chinese, response, of, building, higher, and, higher, levees, along, the, banks, sometimes, also, contributed, to, the, severity, of, the, floods, when, flood, water, did, break, through, the, levees, it, could, no, longer, drain, back, into, the, river, bed, as, it, would, after, a, normal, flood, as, the, river, bed, was, sometimes, now, higher, than, the, surrounding, countryside, these, changes, could, cause, the, river, s, mouth, to, shift, as, much, as, 480, km, 300, mi, sometimes, reaching, the, ocean, to, the, north, of, the, shandong, peninsula, and, sometimes, to, the, south, another, historical, source, of, devastating, floods, is, the, collapse, of, upstream, ice, dams, in, inner, mongolia, with, an, accompanying, sudden, release, of, vast, quantities, of, impounded, water, there, have, been, 11, such, major, floods, in, the, past, century, each, causing, tremendous, loss, of, life, and, property, nowadays, explosives, dropped, from, aircraft, are, used, to, break, the, ice, dams, before, they, become, dangerous, before, modern, dams, appeared, in, china, the, yellow, river, used, to, be, extremely, prone, to, flooding, in, the, 2, 540, years, from, 595, bc, to, 1946, ad, the, yellow, river, has, been, reckoned, to, have, flooded, 1, 593, times, shifting, its, course, 26, times, noticeably, and, nine, times, severely, these, floods, include, some, of, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, ever, recorded, before, modern, disaster, management, when, floods, occurred, some, of, the, population, might, initially, die, from, drowning, and, many, more, would, suffer, later, from, the, ensuing, famine, and, spread, of, diseases, in, chinese, mythology, the, giant, kua, fu, drained, the, yellow, river, and, the, wei, river, to, quench, his, burning, thirst, as, he, pursued, the, sun, historical, documents, from, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, qin, dynasty, indicate, that, the, yellow, river, at, that, time, flowed, considerably, north, of, its, present, course, these, accounts, show, that, after, the, river, passed, luoyang, it, flowed, along, the, border, between, shanxi, and, henan, provinces, then, continued, along, the, border, between, hebei, and, shandong, before, emptying, into, bohai, bay, near, present, day, tianjin, another, outlet, followed, essentially, the, present, course, the, river, left, these, paths, in, 602, bc, and, shifted, several, hundred, kilometers, to, the, east, sabotage, of, dikes, canals, and, reservoirs, and, deliberate, flooding, of, rival, states, became, a, standard, military, tactic, during, the, warring, states, period, as, the, yellow, river, valley, was, the, major, entryway, to, the, guanzhong, area, and, the, state, of, qin, from, the, north, china, plain, qin, heavily, fortified, the, hangu, pass, it, saw, numerous, battles, and, was, also, an, important, chokepoint, protecting, the, han, capitals, of, chang, an, and, luoyang, major, flooding, in, ad, 11, is, credited, with, the, downfall, of, the, short, lived, xin, dynasty, and, another, flood, in, ad, 70, returned, the, river, north, of, shandong, on, essentially, its, present, course, from, around, the, beginning, of, the, 3rd, century, the, importance, of, the, hangu, pass, was, reduced, with, the, major, fortifications, and, military, bases, moved, upriver, to, tongguan, in, ad, 923, the, desperate, later, liang, general, duan, ning, again, broke, the, dikes, flooding, 1, 000, square, miles, 2, 600, km, 2, in, a, failed, attempt, to, protect, his, realm, s, capital, from, the, later, tang, a, similar, proposal, from, the, song, engineer, li, chun, concerning, flooding, the, lower, reaches, of, the, river, to, protect, the, central, plains, from, the, khitai, was, overruled, in, 1020, the, chanyuan, treaty, between, the, two, states, had, expressly, forbidden, the, song, from, establishing, new, moats, or, changing, river, courses, breaches, occurred, regardless, one, at, henglong, in, 1034, divided, the, course, in, three, and, repeatedly, flooded, the, northern, regions, of, dezhou, and, bozhou, the, song, worked, for, five, years, futilely, attempting, to, restore, the, previous, course, using, over, 35, 000, employees, 100, 000, conscripts, and, 220, 000, tons, of, wood, and, bamboo, in, a, single, year, before, abandoning, the, project, in, 1041, the, more, sluggish, river, then, occasioned, a, breach, at, shanghu, that, sent, the, main, outlet, north, towards, tianjin, in, 1048, in, 1128, song, troops, under, the, kaifeng, governor, du, chong, d, ch, ng, d, 1141, breached, the, southern, dikes, of, the, yellow, river, in, an, effort, to, stop, the, advancing, jin, army, the, resulting, major, river, avulsion, allowed, the, yellow, to, capture, the, si, and, other, tributaries, of, the, huai, river, for, the, first, time, in, recorded, history, the, yellow, river, shifted, completely, south, of, shandong, peninsula, and, flowed, into, the, yellow, sea, by, 1194, the, mouth, of, the, huai, had, been, blocked, the, buildup, of, silt, deposits, was, such, that, even, after, the, yellow, river, later, shifted, its, course, the, huai, could, no, longer, flow, along, its, historic, course, but, instead, its, water, pools, into, hongze, lake, and, then, runs, southward, toward, the, yangtze, river, a, flood, in, 1344, returned, the, yellow, river, south, of, shandong, the, yuan, dynasty, was, waning, and, the, emperor, forced, enormous, teams, to, build, new, embankments, for, the, river, the, terrible, conditions, helped, to, fuel, rebellions, that, led, to, the, founding, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, course, changed, again, in, 1391, when, the, river, flooded, from, kaifeng, to, fengyang, in, anhui, it, was, finally, stabilized, by, the, eunuch, li, xing, during, the, public, works, projects, following, the, 1494, flood, the, river, flooded, many, times, in, the, 16th, century, including, in, 1526, 1534, 1558, and, 1587, each, flood, affected, the, river, s, lower, course, the, 1642, flood, was, man, made, caused, by, the, attempt, of, the, ming, governor, of, kaifeng, to, use, the, river, to, destroy, the, peasant, rebels, under, li, zicheng, who, had, been, besieging, the, city, for, the, past, six, months, he, directed, his, men, to, break, the, dikes, in, an, attempt, to, flood, the, rebels, but, destroyed, his, own, city, instead, the, flood, and, the, ensuing, famine, and, plague, are, estimated, to, have, killed, 300, 000, of, the, city, s, previous, population, of, 378, 000, the, once, prosperous, city, was, nearly, abandoned, until, its, rebuilding, under, the, kangxi, emperor, in, the, qing, dynasty, the, question, of, how, aggressively, flooding, should, be, controlled, and, whether, it, should, be, steered, back, to, its, original, channels, when, it, migrated, was, a, topic, of, controversy, in, the, imperial, court, rival, cliques, made, arguments, based, on, budgetary, technical, and, strategic, criteria, geographer, charles, greer, identifies, two, competing, schools, of, thought, on, how, to, control, the, yellow, river, one, which, he, identifies, as, confucian, advocated, containing, the, river, between, higher, levees, thus, maximizing, the, amount, of, river, basin, land, that, could, be, cultivated, the, other, which, he, associates, with, taoism, favored, lower, levees, separated, by, as, much, as, 5, 10, kilometers, in, one, particular, long, running, debate, during, the, 11th, century, reigns, of, the, renzong, and, shenzong, emperors, when, the, river, repeatedly, broke, its, levees, and, migrated, north, and, west, officials, battled, over, whether, expensive, measures, should, be, taken, to, return, the, river, to, its, former, channels, the, shenzong, emperor, ultimately, decreed, that, the, river, be, allowed, to, remain, in, its, new, course, traditional, flood, control, techniques, made, use, of, levees, revetments, to, absorb, the, energy, of, the, water, overflow, basins, drainage, canals, and, polders, treatises, on, traditional, flood, control, techniques, were, written, by, officials, such, as, pan, jixun, who, argued, that, joining, branches, of, the, river, increased, the, water, s, power, and, this, in, turn, increased, its, ability, to, flush, sediment, the, difficult, situation, around, the, confluence, of, the, yellow, river, the, huai, and, the, grand, canal, however, still, led, to, a, major, flood, of, the, regional, center, sizhou, and, pan, s, dismissal, from, court, subsequently, the, river, s, 1680, flood, entirely, submerged, sizhou, and, the, nearby, ming, zuling, tombs, beneath, hongze, lake, for, centuries, until, modern, irrigation, and, flood, control, lowered, the, water, level, enough, to, permit, their, excavation, and, the, tombs, restoration, between, 1851, and, 1855, the, yellow, river, returned, to, the, north, amid, the, floods, that, provoked, the, nien, and, taiping, rebellions, the, 1887, flood, has, been, estimated, to, have, killed, between, 900, 000, and, 2, million, people, and, is, the, second, worst, natural, disaster, in, history, excluding, famines, and, epidemics, the, yellow, river, more, or, less, adopted, its, present, course, during, the, 1897, flood, the, 1931, flood, killed, an, estimated, 1, 000, 000, to, 4, 000, 000, and, is, the, worst, natural, disaster, recorded, excluding, famines, and, epidemics, on, 9, june, 1938, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, nationalist, troops, under, chiang, kai, shek, broke, the, levees, holding, back, the, river, near, the, village, of, huayuankou, in, henan, causing, what, has, been, called, by, canadian, historian, diana, lary, a, war, induced, natural, disaster, the, goal, of, the, operation, was, to, stop, the, advancing, japanese, troops, by, following, a, strategy, of, using, water, as, a, substitute, for, soldiers, the, 1938, flood, of, an, area, covering, 54, 000, km, 2, 20, 800, sq, mi, took, some, 500, 000, to, 900, 000, chinese, lives, along, with, an, unknown, number, of, japanese, soldiers, the, flood, prevented, the, japanese, army, from, taking, zhengzhou, on, the, southern, bank, of, the, yellow, river, but, did, not, stop, them, from, reaching, their, goal, of, capturing, wuhan, which, was, the, temporary, seat, of, the, chinese, government, and, straddles, the, yangtze, river, in, 1954, the, people, s, republic, of, china, announced, its, general, plan, to, fundamentally, control, yellow, river, flood, disasters, and, develop, yellow, river, waterworks, 111, 113, it, sought, to, address, both, flooding, risks, and, to, convert, rainfall, fed, fields, of, the, north, china, plain, to, irrigated, agriculture, 114, construction, began, in, earnest, in, 1957, 114, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, the, dry, up, trends, accelerated, with, the, yellow, river, failing, to, reach, its, mouth, for, an, average, of, approximately, 180, days, per, year, in, the, 1990s, 168, in, 1997, the, yellow, river, did, not, reach, the, sea, for, 226, consecutive, days, 168, the, yellow, river, basin, has, an, east, west, extent, of, about, 1, 900, kilometers, 1, 180, mi, and, a, north, south, extent, of, about, 1, 100, km, 680, mi, its, total, drainage, area, is, about, 795, 000, square, kilometers, 307, 000, sq, mi, according, to, the, china, exploration, and, research, society, the, source, of, the, yellow, river, is, at, 34, 29, 31, n, 96, 20, 25, e, 34, 49194, n, 96, 34028, e, 34, 49194, 96, 34028, in, the, bayan, har, mountains, near, the, eastern, edge, of, the, yushu, tibetan, autonomous, prefecture, the, source, tributaries,

gansu, the, yellow, river, loops, northwest, and, then, northeast, before, turning, south, creating, the, ordos, loop, and, then, flows, generally, eastward, across, the, north, china, plain, to, the, gulf, of, bohai, draining, a, basin, of, 752, 443, square, kilometers, 290, 520, sq, mi, which, nourishes, 140, million, people, with, drinking, water, and, irrigation, the, yellow, river, passes, through, seven, present, day, provinces, and, two, autonomous, regions, namely, from, west, to, east, qinghai, sichuan, gansu, ningxia, inner, mongolia, shaanxi, shanxi, henan, and, shandong, major, cities, along, the, present, course, of, the, yellow, river, include, from, west, to, east, lanzhou, yinchuan, wuhai, baotou, luoyang, zhengzhou, kaifeng, and, jinan, the, current, mouth, of, the, yellow, river, is, located, at, kenli, county, shandong, the, river, is, commonly, divided, into, three, stages, these, are, roughly, the, northeast, of, the, mountainous, tibetan, plateau, the, ordos, loop, and, loess, plateau, and, the, north, china, plain, however, different, scholars, have, different, opinions, on, how, the, three, stages, are, divided, this, article, mainly, adopts, the, division, used, by, the, yellow, river, conservancy, commission, the, yellow, river, derived, sediments, have, been, transported, out, of, the, bohai, sea, all, way, to, the, north, yellow, sea, and, south, yellow, sea, and, formed, a, distal, depocenter, around, the, shandong, peninsula, the, upper, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, constitute, a, segment, starting, from, its, source, in, the, bayan, har, mountains, and, ending, at, hekou, town, togtoh, county, inner, mongolia, just, before, it, turns, sharply, to, the, south, this, segment, has, a, total, length, of, 3, 472, kilometers, 2, 157, mi, and, total, basin, area, of, 386, 000, square, kilometers, 149, 000, sq, mi, 51, 4, of, the, total, basin, area, along, this, length, the, elevation, of, the, yellow, river, drops, 3, 496, meters, 11, 470, ft, with, an, average, grade, of, 0, 10, the, source, section, flows, mainly, through, pastures, swamps, and, knolls, between, the, bayan, har, mountains, and, the, anemaqen, amne, machin, mountains, in, qinghai, the, river, water, is, clear, and, flows, steadily, crystal, clear, lakes, are, characteristic, of, this, section, the, two, main, lakes, along, this, section, are, lake, gyaring, zhaling, and, lake, ngoring, eling, with, capacities, of, 4, 7, billion, and, 10, 8, billion, m, 3, 166, and, 381, billion, ft, 3, respectively, at, elevations, over, 4, 290, m, 14, 070, ft, above, sea, level, they, are, the, two, largest, plateau, freshwater, lakes, nationwide, a, significant, amount, of, land, in, the, yellow, river, s, source, area, has, been, designated, as, the, sanjiangyuan, three, rivers, sources, national, nature, reserve, to, protect, the, source, region, of, the, yellow, river, the, yangtze, and, the, mekong, flowing, east, at, the, eastern, edge, of, the, amne, machin, mountains, the, yellow, river, enters, maqu, county, in, gansu, here, the, river, skirts, through, the, high, altitude, peat, bog, known, as, the, zoig, wetlands, and, makes, a, sharp, turn, towards, the, northwest, forming, the, border, between, maqu, and, zoig, county, in, sichuan, flowing, now, along, the, northern, edge, of, amne, machin, the, river, reenters, qinghai, and, gradually, curves, north, towards, the, longyang, gorge, at, xinghai, the, valley, section, stretches, from, longyang, gorge, in, qinghai, to, qingtong, gorge, in, gansu, steep, cliffs, line, both, sides, of, the, river, the, water, bed, is, narrow, and, the, average, drop, is, large, so, the, flow, in, this, section, is, extremely, turbulent, and, fast, there, are, 20, gorges, in, this, section, the, most, famous, of, these, being, the, longyang, jishi, liujia, bapan, and, qingtong, gorges, the, flow, conditions, in, this, section, makes, it, the, best, location, for, hydroelectric, plants, the, yellow, river, exits, qinghai, for, the, second, and, final, time, in, these, gorges, and, enters, gansu, for, the, second, time, just, before, liujia, gorge, downstream, from, the, yanguo, gorge, the, provincial, capital, of, lanzhou, is, built, upon, the, yellow, river, s, banks, the, yellow, river, flows, northeasterly, out, of, gansu, and, into, ningxia, before, the, qingtong, gorge, after, emerging, from, the, qingtong, gorge, the, river, comes, into, a, section, of, vast, alluvial, plains, the, yinchuan, plain, and, hetao, plain, in, this, section, the, regions, along, the, river, are, mostly, deserts, and, grasslands, with, very, few, tributaries, the, flow, is, slow, the, hetao, plain, has, a, length, of, 900, km, 560, mi, and, width, of, 30, to, 50, km, 19, to, 31, mi, it, is, historically, the, most, important, irrigation, plain, along, the, yellow, river, the, ordos, loop, formed, by, an, enormous, twist, of, the, yellow, river, beginning, at, zhongning, county, in, ningxia, and, ending, with, a, drastic, eastward, turn, at, its, confluence, with, the, wei, at, tongguan, in, shaanxi, however, the, official, division, for, the, middle, reaches, of, the, river, run, from, hekou, in, togtoh, county, inner, mongolia, to, zhengzhou, henan, the, middle, reaches, are, 1, 206, km, 749, mi, long, with, a, basin, area, of, 344, 000, square,

reaches, and, the, water, flow, is, increased, by, 43, 5, on, this, stage, the, middle, reaches, contribute, 92, of, the, river, s, silts, the, middle, stream, of, the, yellow, river, passes, through, the, loess, plateau, where, substantial, erosion, takes, place, the, large, amount, of, mud, and, sand, discharged, into, the, river, makes, the, yellow, river, the, most, sediment, laden, river, in, the, world, the, highest, recorded, annual, level, of, silts, discharged, into, the, yellow, river, is, 3, 91, billion, tons, in, 1933, the, highest, silt, concentration, level, was, recorded, in, 1977, at, 920, kg, m, 3, 57, 4, lb, ft, 3, these, sediments, later, deposit, in, the, slower, lower, reaches, of, the, river, elevating, the, river, bed, and, creating, the, famous, river, above,

this, valley, on, the, border, of, shanxi, and, shaanxi, in, the, lower, reaches, from, zhengzhou, to, its, mouth, a, distance, of, 786, km, 488, mi, the, river, is, confined, to, a, levee, lined, course, as, it, flows, to, the, northeast, across, the, north, china, plain, before, emptying, into, the, bohai, sea, the, basin, area, in, this, stage, is, only, 23, 000, square, kilometers, 8, 900, sq, mi, a, mere, 3, of, the, total, because, few, tributaries, add, to, the, flow, in, this, stage, nearly, all, rivers, to, the, south, drain, into, the, huai, river, whereas, those, to, the, north, drain, into, the, hai, river, the, huai, river, basin, for, example, is, separated, from, the, yellow, river, basin, by, the, south, dike, of, the, yellow, river, the, total, drop, in, elevation, of, the, lower, reaches, is, 93, 6, m, 307, ft, with, an, average, grade, of, 0, 012, the, silts, received, from, the, middle, reaches, form, sediments, here, elevating, the, river, bed, excessive, sediment, deposits, have, raised, the, riverbed, several, meters, above, the, surrounding, ground, that, is, why, this, part, of, the, river, is, called, the, earth, suspended, river, at, kaifeng, henan, the, yellow, river, is, 10, meters, 33, ft, above, the, ground, level, tributaries, of, the, yellow, river, listed, from, its, source, to, its, mouth, include, the, lower, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, have, no, tributaries, 168, the, yellow, river, is, notable, for, the, large, amount, of, silt, it, carries, 1, 6, billion, tons, annually, at, the, point, where, it, descends, from, the, loess, plateau, if, it, is, running, to, the, sea, with, sufficient, volume, 1, 4, billion, tons, are, carried, to, the, sea, per, year, one, estimate, gives, 34, kilograms, of, silt, per, cubic, meter, as, opposed, to, 10, for, the, colorado, and, 1, for, the, nile, its, average, discharge, is, said, to, be, 2, 110, cubic, meters, per, second, 32, 000, for, the, yangtze, with, a, maximum, of, 25, 000, and, minimum, of, 245, however, since, 1972, it, often, runs, dry, before, it, reaches, the, sea, the, low, volume, is, due, to, increased, agricultural, irrigation, increased, by, a, factor, of, five, since, 1950, water, diverted, from, the, river, as, of, 1999, served, 140, million, people, and, irrigated, 74, 000, km, 2, 29, 000, sq, mi, of, land, the, yellow, river, delta, totals, 8, 000, square, kilometers, 3, 100, square, miles, however, with, the, decrease, in, silt, reaching, the, sea, it, has, been, reported, to, be, shrinking, slightly, each, year, since, 1996, through, erosion, the, highest, volume, occurs, during, the, rainy, season, from, july, to, october, when, 60, of, the, annual, volume, of, the, river, flows, maximum, demand, for, irrigation, is, needed, between, march, and, june, in, order, to, capture, excess, water, for, use, when, needed, and, for, flood, control, and, electricity, generation, several, dams, have, been, built, but, their, expected, life, is, limited, due, to, the, high, silt, load, a, proposed, south, north, water, transfer, project, involves, several, schemes, to, divert, water, from, the, yangtze, one, in, the, western, headwaters, of, the, rivers, where, they, are, closest, to, one, another, another, from, the, upper, reaches, of, the, han, river, and, a, third, using, the, route, of, the, old, grand, canal, due, to, its, heavy, load, of, silt, the, yellow, river, is, a, depositing, stream, that, is, it, deposits, part, of, its, carried, burden, of, soil, in, its, bed, in, stretches, where, it, is, flowing, slowly, these, deposits, elevate, the, riverbed, which, flows, between, natural, levees, in, its, lower, reaches, should, a, flood, occur, the, river, may, break, out, of, the, levees, into, the, surrounding, lower, flood, plain, and, take, a, new, channel, historically, this, has, occurred, about, once, every, hundred, years, in, modern, times, considerable, effort, has, been, made, to, strengthen, levees, and, control, floods, below, is, an, incomplete, list, of, hydroelectric, power, stations, built, on, the, yellow, river, arranged, according, to, the, first, year, of, operation, in, brackets, as, reported, in, 2000, the, 7, largest, hydro, power, plants, longyangxia, lijiaxia, liujiaxia, yanguoxia, bapanxia, daxia, and, qinglongxia, had, the, total, installed, capacity, of, 5, 618, mw, the, main, bridges, and, ferries, by, the, province, names, in, the, order, of, downstream, to, upstream, are, shandong, shandong, henan, henan, shanxi, henan, shaanxi, henan, ningxia, inner, mongolia, gansu, qinghai, the, yellow, river, basin, is, rich, in, fish, being, the, home, of, more, than, 160, native, species, in, 92, genera, and, 28, families, including, 19, species, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, endemic, however, due, to, habitat, loss, pollution, introduced, species, and, overfishing, many, of, the, natives, have, declined, or, disappeared, entirely, several, are, recognized, as, threatened, on, china, s, red, list, dams, and, their, reservoirs, have, increased, the, habitat, for, species, of, slow, moving, and, static, waters, while, it, excluded, species, of, flowing, waters, and, prevented, the, up, and, down, stream, breeding, migration, of, others, in, the, 2000s, only, 80, native, fish, in, 63, genera, and, 18, families, were, recorded, in, the, yellow, river, basin, in, contrast, introduced, fish, have, risen, in, both, abundance, and, number, of, species, only, one, introduced, fish, species, was, recorded, in, the, 1960s, when, ichthyologist, li, sizhong, published, his, original, survey, of, fish, fauna, of, the, region, but, by, the, 2000s, there, were, 26, as, typical, of, asian, rivers, cyprinidae, is, by, far, the, most, diverse, family, in, the, yellow, river, basin, more, than, 85, cyprinids, have, been, recorded, in, this, basin, including, species, that, still, are, present, and, species, that, no, longer, are, present, other, highly, diverse, families, are, the, stone, loaches, more, than, 20, species, gobies, c, 15, species, true, loaches, c, 10, species, and, bagrid, catfish, c, 10, species, although, there, are, species, found, throughout, much, of, the, river, several, have, a, more, restricted, range, for, example, the, uppermost, highest, parts, on, the, qinghai, tibet, plateau, has, relatively, few, native, species, notably, snowtrout, and, allies, gymnocypris, gymnodiptychus, platypharodon, and, schizopygopsis, and, triplophysa, loaches, of, the, 18, endemics, in, the, yellow, river, basin, 12, are, or, were, found, in, the, upper, part, these, in, particular, have, become, threatened, and, the, fish, fauna, in, many, headwaters, are, now, dominated, by, introduced, salmonids, in, contrast, the, lowermost, part, of, the, river, and, its, delta, are, home, to, many, brackish, water, or, euryhaline, species, like, gobies, although, there, are, also, true, freshwater, gobies, in, the, yellow, river, asian, seabasses, flatfish, and, takifugu, pufferfish, fishing, remains, an, important, activity, but, catches, have, declined, in, 2007, it, was, noted, that, 40, fewer, fish, were, caught, in, the, yellow, river, compared, to, earlier, catches, large, cyprinids, asian, carp, predatory, carp, wuchang, bream, and, mongolian, redfin, and, large, catfish, amur, and, lanzhou, catfish, are, still, present, but, the, largest, species, the, chinese, paddlefish, kaluga, sturgeon, and, yangtze, sturgeon, have, not, been, reported, from, the, yellow, river, basin, in, about, 50, years, other, species, that, support, important, fisheries, include, white, amur, bream, ayu, mandarin, fish, protosalanx, icefish, northern, snakehead, asian, swamp, eel, and, others, annual, fishing, ban, has, been, implemented, since, 2018, covering, the, entire, yellow, river, basin, from, 1, april, to, 30, june, each, year, a, total, ban, of, fishing, of, natural, fishes, is, being, implemented, in, the, upper, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, starting, 1, april, 2022, covering, qinghai, sichuan, and, gansu, provinces, until, the, end, of, 2025, for, the, rest, of, the, basin, the, annual, ban, is, extended, to, a, period, from, 1, april, to, 31, july, the, yellow, river, is, generally, less, suitable, for, aquaculture, than, the, rivers, of, central, and, southern, china, such, as, the, yangtze, or, pearl, rivers, but, aquaculture, is, also, practiced, in, some, areas, along, the, yellow, river, an, important, aquaculture, area, is, the, riverside, plain, in, xingyang, upstream, from, zhengzhou, since, the, development, of, fish, ponds, started, in, xingyang, s, riverside, wangcun, town, in, 1986, the, pond, systems, in, wangcun, have, grown, to, the, total, size, of, 15, 000, mu, 10, km, 2, making, the, town, the, largest, aquaculture, center, in, north, china, two, turtle, species, are, native, to, the, yellow, river, basin, the, chinese, pond, turtle, and, chinese, softshell, turtle, both, species, but, especially, the, softshell, are, widely, farmed, for, food, a, variety, of, the, chinese, softshell, turtle, popular, in, chinese, gourmets, is, called, the, yellow, river, turtle, nowadays, most, of, the, yellow, river, turtles, eaten, in, china, s, restaurants, comes, from, turtle, farms, which, may, or, may, not, be, near, the, yellow, river, in, 2007, construction, started, in, wangcun, henan, on, a, large, farm, for, raising, this, turtle, variety, with, the, capacity, for, raising, 5, million, turtles, a, year, the, facility, was, expected, to, become, henan, s, largest, farm, of, this, kind, the, huge, entirely, aquatic, chinese, giant, salamander, a, species, that, has, declined, drastically, due, primarily, to, persecution, for, food, and, traditional, medicine, is, native, to, the, yellow, river, and, other, chinese, rivers, it, is, farmed, in, large, numbers, in, several, parts, of, china, and, genetic, studies, have, revealed, that, the, captive, stock, mostly, is, of, yellow, river, origin, as, these, often, are, released, back, into, the, wild, the, yellow, river, type, of, the, chinese, giant, salamander, has, spread, to, other, parts, of, china, which, represents, a, problem, to, the, other, types, on, 25, november, 2008, tania, branigan, of, the, guardian, filed, a,

to, factory, discharges, and, sewage, from, fast, expanding, cities, after, reaching, the, first, major, city, xining, the, river, is, heavily, polluted, the, yellow, river, conservancy, commission, had, surveyed, more, than, 8, 384, mi, 13, 493, km, of, the, river, in, 2007, and, said, 33, 8, of, the, river, system, registered, worse, than, level, five, according, to, the, criteria, used, by, the, un, environment, program, level, five, is, unfit, for, drinking, aquaculture, industrial, use, or, even, agriculture, the, report, said, waste, and, sewage, discharged, into, the, system, last, year, totaled, 4, 29b, tons, industry, and, manufacturing, made, up, 70, of, the, discharge, into, the, river, with, households, accounting, for, 23, and, just, over, 6, coming, from, other, sources, a, traditional, belief, was, that, the, yellow, river, flowed, from, heaven, as, a, continuation, of, the, milky, way, in, a, chinese, legend, zhang, qian, is, said, to, have, been, commissioned, to, find, the, source, of, the, yellow, river, after, sailing, up, river, for, many, days, he, saw, a, girl, spinning, and, a, cow, herd, upon, asking, the, girl, where, he, was, she, presented, him, with, her, shuttle, with, instructions, to, show, it, to, the, astrologer, yan, junping, when, he, returned, the, astrologer, recognized, it, as, the, shuttle, of, the, weaving, girl, vega, and,

hebei, and, henan, derive, their, names, from, the, yellow, river, their, names, mean, respectively, north, of, the, river, and, south, of, the, river, although, the, border, between, them, historically, has, never, been, stable, and, currently, the, border, between, hebei, and, henan, is, not, the, yellow, river, but, the, zhang, river, instead, traditionally, it, is, believed, that, the, chinese, civilization, originated, in, the, yellow, river, basin, the, chinese, refer, to, the, river, as, the, mother, river, and, the, cradle, of, the, chinese, civilization, during, the, long, history, of, china, the, yellow, river, has, been, considered, a, blessing, as, well, as, a, curse, and, has, been, nicknamed, both, china, s, pride, and, china, s, sorrow, in, the, twentieth, century, the, river, became, a, symbol, of, the, rising, chinese, nation, in, the, face, of, western, and, japanese, imperialism, despite, yellow, river, having, a, central, role, in, the, development, of, chinese, civilization, on, north, china, plain, flooding, and, constant, rerouting, of, the, river, have, also, caused, many, great, disaster, to, population, along, the, river, for, long, hence, it, is, also, known, as, a, river, of, disaster, chinese, with, the, disaster, brought, by, the, river, said, as, history, of, disaster, in, the, development, of, chinese, civilization, and, the, management, of, yellow, river, have, been, a, great, political, trouble, to, various, chinese, dynasties, throughout, the, history, since, ancient, time, sometimes, the, yellow, river, is, poetically, called, the, muddy, flow, zhu, li, the, chinese, idiom, when, the, yellow, river, flows, clear, is, used, to, refer, to, an, event, that, will, never, happen, and, is, similar, to, the,
