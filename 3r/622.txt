many, decades, for, the, country, to, return, of, the, disaster, suffered, by, the, paraguayans, at, the, outcome, of, the, war, william, d, rubinstein, wrote, the, normal, estimate, is, that, of, a, paraguayan, population, of, somewhere, between, 450, 000, and, 900, 000, only, 220, 000, survived, the, war, of, whom, only, 28, 000, were, adult, males, during, the, pillaging, of, asunci, n, in,

the, u, s, in, addressing, transnational, crime, and, terrorism, in, the, triple, frontier, region, paraguay, is, the, 73rd, most, peaceful, country, in, the, world, according, to, the, 2024, global, peace, index, paraguay, consists, of, seventeen, departments, and, one, capital, district, distrito, capital, it, is, also, divided, into, two, regions, the, occidental, region, or, chaco, boquer, n, alto, paraguay, and, presidente, hayes, and, the, oriental, region, the, other, departments, and, the, capital, district, these, are, the, departments, with, their, capitals, population, area, and, the, number, of, districts, for, many, years, the, country, s, image, was, associated, with, the, illicit, trade, in, electronic, products, weapons, and, drugs, however, this, scenario, began, to, change, in, the, 2000s, with, the, rise, of, legalized, businesses, such, as, the, production, of, soy, maize, beef, among, others, data, from, the, central, bank, of, paraguay, bcp, showed, that, in, 2006, exports, related, to, the, triangulation, trade, china, paraguay, brazil, treated, by, brazil, in, most, cases, as, smuggling, and, embezzlement, represented, 22, of, the, country, s, gdp, in, 2016, this, percentage, dropped, to, 12, with, higher, tax, collections, through, legalized, employment, the, country, has, been, able, to, improve, its, infrastructure, which, was, precarious, paraguay, has, an, economic, development, policy, based, on, exports, and, dependence, on, the, brazilian, market, prevails, the, triangulation, trade, has, in, its, essence, the, export, of, products, originating, in, china, with, brazil, as, its, main, destination, the, energy, exported, is, essentially, the, hydroelectric, surplus, generated, by, the, itaipu, power, plant, for, which, brazil, is, the, main, buyer, and, maquilas, whose, main, investors, are, brazilians, also, have, a, large, consumer, market, in, brazil, for, their, products, therefore, in, these, three, pillars, of, paraguay, s, development, strategy, there, is, the, outstanding, characteristic, of, re, exports, in, the, case, of, agricultural, commodities, it, is, the, export, of, products, originating, in, paraguay, in, the, 2010s, the, economy, largely, directed, towards, soybean, production, grew, by, an, average, of, 4, the, economic, growth, did, not, however, reduce, poverty, which, in, 2018, according, to, official, figures, reached, more, than, 26, of, the, population, according, to, the, new, york, times, paraguay, is, one, of, the, latin, american, countries, where, the, gap, between, rich, and, poor, has, widened, the, most, in, recent, years, in, the, countryside, 85, of, agricultural, land, is, owned, by, 2, 6, of, the, owners, in, addition, people, of, indigenous, descent, have, been, expelled, to, make, way, for, soybean, companies, the, soybean, export, market, is, largely, dominated, by, multinationals, cargill, archer, daniels, midland, bunge, limited, etc, and, therefore, benefits, few, paraguayans, export, companies, and, landowners, pay, little, tax, for, example, a, study, by, eclac, a, un, agency, released, in, 2018, indicates, that, paraguay, is, one, of, the, countries, where, companies, participate, the, least, in, the, state, budget, pesticides, and, other, chemicals, are, used, heavily, in, soybean, fields, the, country, s, environmental, standards, are, not, met, by, companies, and, agrochemicals, contaminate, the, environment, in, 2019, the, united, nations, human, rights, committee, issued, a, ruling, urging, paraguay, to, undertake, an, investigation, into, the, massive, fumigation, of, agrochemicals, and, the, poisoning, of, the, population, however, the, situation, is, not, improving, the, high, level, of, political, corruption, the, extreme, fragility, of, institutions, the, high, level, of, social, vulnerability, the, omnipotence, of, economic, interests, in, political, decisions, as, well, as, the, location, in, the, geographic, heart, of, the, southern, cone, and, its, abundance, of, natural, resources, make, paraguay, an, attractive, target, for, imperial, geopolitical, interests, says, sociologist, tom, s, palau, academic, jos, luis, insfr, n, also, notes, that, the, country, s, politicians, are, subsidized, by, big, business, they, are, the, ones, who, implement, the, policies, in, 2005, the, international, monetary, fund, stated, that, fewer, than, 10, of, workers, in, paraguay, participate, in, the, pension, system, 95, of, which, is, administered, by, two, institutions, both, are, financed, on, a, pay, as, you, go, system, by, worker, contributions, the, first, instituto, de, previsi, n, social, is, for, private, sector, employees, and, the, caja, fiscal, for, public, employees, including, university, professors, teachers, judicial, employees, army, officers, and, police, officers, and, veterans, of, the, chaco, war, or, their, descendants, the, market, economy, is, distinguished, by, a, large, informal, sector, featuring, re, export, of, imported, consumer, goods, to, neighboring, countries, as, well, as, the, activities, of, thousands, of, microenterprises, and, urban, street, vendors, nonetheless, over, the, last, 10, years, the, paraguayan, economy, diversified, dramatically, with, the, energy, auto, parts, and, clothing, industries, leading, the, way, paraguay, s, most, important, urban, areas, are, located, along, the, argentina, paraguay, border, asunci, n, alberdi, encarnaci, n, pilar, and, ciudad, del, este, the, latter, being, the, third, most, important, free, commercial, zone, in, the, world, only, trailing, behind, miami, and, hong, kong, a, large, percentage, of, the, population, especially, in, rural, areas, derives, its, living, from, agricultural, activity, often, on, a, subsistence, basis, because, of, the, importance, of, the, informal, sector, accurate, economic, measures, are, difficult, to, obtain, the, economy, grew, rapidly, between, 2003, and, 2013, as, growing, world, demand, for, commodities, combined, with, high, prices, and, favorable, weather, to, support, paraguay, s, commodity, based, export, expansion, in, 2012, paraguay, s, government, introduced, the, mercosur, focem, system, in, order, to, stimulate, the, economy, and, job, growth, through, a, partnership, with, both, brazil, and, argentina, the,

brasiguaios, the, first, brazilian, producers, began, to, arrive, in, the, country, in, the, 1980s, before, the, brazilian, influx, much, of, the, land, in, paraguay, was, uncultivated, more, than, 80, of, the, cultivable, land, is, owned, by, 2, 6, of, landowners, nearly, 8, million, hectares, were, illegally, granted, in, violation, of, the, agrarian, law, to, regime, supporters, during, the,

have, been, assassinated, since, the, fall, of, stroessner, in, 1989, the, methods, of, appropriating, land, in, paraguay, are, numerous, economist, luis, rojas, says, that, the, most, common, method, is, to, buy, land, from, small, producers, the, peasant, is, offered, a, sum, of, money, he, has, never, seen, in, his, life, he, imagines, it, s, a, fortune, leaves, for, the, city, spends, it, all, in, three, or, four, months, and, makes, the, misery, belts, grow, because, there, is, no, work, oxfam, estimates, that, 900, 000, people, have, been, evicted, from, the, countryside, in, the, last,
