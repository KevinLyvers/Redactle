the, us, new, brunswick, and, upper, canada, the, creation, of, upper, and, lower, canada, allowed, loyalists, to, live, under, british, laws, and, institutions, while, canadiens, could, maintain, their, french, civil, law, and, catholic, religion, governor, haldimand, drew, loyalists, away, from, quebec, city, and, montreal, by, offering, free, land, on, the, north, shore, of, lake, ontario,

battle, of, the, chateauguay, this, loss, caused, the, americans, to, abandon, the, saint, lawrence, campaign, their, major, strategic, effort, to, conquer, canada, gradually, the, legislative, assembly, of, lower, canada, who, represented, the, people, came, into, conflict, with, the, superior, authority, of, the, crown, and, its, appointed, representatives, starting, in, 1791, the, government, of, lower, canada, was, criticized, and, contested, by, the, parti, canadien, in, 1834, the, parti, canadien, presented, its, 92, resolutions, political, demands, which, expressed, loss, of, confidence, in, the, british, monarchy, discontentment, intensified, throughout, the, public, meetings, of, 1837, and, the, lower, canada, rebellion, began, in, 1837, in, 1837, louis, joseph, papineau, and, robert, nelson, led, residents, of, lower, canada, to, form, an, armed, group, called, the, patriotes, they, made, a, declaration, of, independence, in, 1838, guaranteeing, rights, and, equality, for, all, citizens, without, discrimination, their, actions, resulted, in, rebellions, in, both, lower, and, upper, canada, the, patriotes, were, victorious, in, their, first, battle, the, battle, of, saint, denis, however, they, were, unorganized, and, badly, equipped, leading, to, their, loss, against, the, british, army, in, the, battle, of, saint, charles, and, defeat, in, the, battle, of, saint, eustache, in, response, to, the, rebellions, lord, durham, was, asked, to, undertake, a, study, and, prepare, a, report, offering, a, solution, to, the, british, parliament, durham, recommended, that, canadiens, be, culturally, assimilated, with, english, as, their, only, official, language, to, do, this, the, british, passed, the, act, of, union, 1840, which, merged, upper, canada, and, lower, canada, into, a, single, colony, the, province, of, canada, lower, canada, became, the, francophone, and, densely, populated, canada, east, and, upper, canada, became, the, anglophone, and, sparsely, populated, canada, west, this, union, unsurprisingly, was, the, main, source, of, political, instability, until, 1867, despite, their, population, gap, canada, east, and, canada, west, obtained, an, identical, number, of, seats, in, the, legislative, assembly, of, the, province, of, canada, which, created, representation, problems, in, the, beginning, canada, east, was, underrepresented, because, of, its, superior, population, size, over, time, however, massive, immigration, from, the, british, isles, to, canada, west, occurred, since, the, two, regions, continued, to, have, equal, representation, this, meant, it, was, now, canada, west, that, was, under, represented, the, representation, issues, were, called, into, question, by, debates, on, representation, by, population, the, british, population, began, to, use, the, term, canadian, referring, to, canada, their, place, of, residence, the, french, population, who, had, thus, far, identified, as, canadiens, began, to, be, identified, with, their, ethnic, community, under, the, name, french, canadian, as, they, were, a, french, of, canada, as, access, to, new, lands, remained, problematic, because, they, were, still, monopolized, by, the, clique, du, ch, teau, an, exodus, of, canadiens, towards, new, england, began, and, went, on, for, the, next, hundred, years, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, grande, h, morragie, and, threatened, the, survival, of, the, canadien, nation, the, massive, british, immigration, ordered, from, london, that, followed, the, failed, rebellion, compounded, this, to, combat, it, the, church, adopted, the, revenge, of, the, cradle, policy, in, 1844, the, capital, of, the, province, of, canada, was, moved, from, kingston, to,

was, built, and, the, canadian, american, reciprocity, treaty, was, implemented, in, 1866, the, civil, code, of, lower, canada, was, adopted, in, 1864, negotiations, began, for, canadian,

argued, for, the, establishment, of, the, province, of, quebec, initially, composed, of, the, historic, heart, of, the, territory, of, the, french, canadian, nation, and, where, french, canadians, would, most, likely, retain, majority, status, following, the, london, conference, of, 1866, the, quebec, resolutions, were, implemented, as, the, british, north, america, act, 1867, and, brought,
