world, cultural, and, natural, heritage, which, was, adopted, by, the, general, conference, of, unesco, on, 16, november, 1972, since, then, 195, states, have, ratified, the, convention, making, it, one, of, the, most, widely, recognised, international, agreements, and, the, world, s, most, popular, cultural, programme, to, be, considered, the, properties, must, be, under, some, form, of, state, protection, or, conservation, and, be, nominated, by, the, host, member, country, in, 1954, the, government, of, egypt, decided, to, build, the, new, aswan, high, dam, whose, resulting, future, reservoir, would, eventually, inundate, a, large, stretch, of, the, nile, valley, containing, cultural, treasures, of, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, nubia, in, 1959, the, governments, of, egypt, and, sudan, requested, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, unesco, to, assist, them, to, protect, and, rescue, the, endangered, monuments, and, sites, in, 1960, the, director, general, of, unesco, launched, the, international, campaign, to, save, the, monuments, of, nubia, this, international, campaign, to, save, the, monuments, of, nubia, resulted, in, the, excavation, and, recording, of, hundreds, of, sites, the, recovery, of, thousands, of, objects, as, well, as, the, salvage, and, relocation, to, higher, ground, of, several, important, temples, the, most, famous, of, these, are, the, temple, complexes, of, abu, simbel, and, philae, the, campaign, ended, in, 1980, and, was, considered, a, success, to, thank, countries, which, especially, contributed, to, the, campaign, s, success, egypt, donated, four, temples, the, temple, of, dendur, was, moved, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, the, temple, of, debod, to,

the, world, heritage, committee, was, developed, over, a, seven, year, period, 1965, 1972, the, united, states, initiated, the, idea, of, safeguarding, places, of, high, cultural, or, natural, importance, a, white, house, conference, in, 1965, called, for, a, world, heritage, trust, to, preserve, the, world, s, superb, natural, and, scenic, areas, and, historic, sites, for, the, present, and, the, future, of, the, entire, world, citizenry, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, developed, similar, proposals, in, 1968, which, were, presented, in, 1972, at, the, united, nations, conference, on, the, human, environment, in, stockholm, under, the, world, heritage, committee, signatory, countries, are, required, to, produce, and, submit, periodic, data, reporting, providing, the, committee, with, an, overview, of, each, participating, nation, s, implementation, of, the, world, heritage, convention, and, a, snapshot, of, current, conditions, at, world, heritage, properties, based, on, the, draft, convention, that, unesco, had, initiated, a, single, text, was, eventually, agreed, upon, by, all, parties, and, the, convention, concerning, the, protection, of, the, world, cultural, and, natural, heritage, was, adopted, by, the, general, conference, of, unesco, on, 16, november, 1972, the, convention, came, into, force, on, 17, december, 1975, as, of, may, 2023, it, has, been, ratified, by, 195, states, 191, un, member, states, two, un, observer, states, the, holy, see, and, the, state, of, palestine, and, two, states, in, free, association, with, new, zealand, the, cook, islands, and, niue, only, two, un, member, states, liechtenstein, and, nauru, have, not, ratified, the, convention, by, assigning, places, as, world, heritage, sites, unesco, wants, to, help, preserve, them, for, future, generations, its, motivation, is, that, heritage, is, our, legacy, from, the, past, what, we, live, with, today, and, that, both, cultural, and, natural, heritage, are, irreplaceable, sources, of, life, and, inspiration, unesco, s, mission, with, respect, to, world, heritage, consists, of, eight, sub, targets, these, include, encouraging, the, commitment, of, countries, and, local, population, to, world, heritage, conservation, in, various, ways, providing, emergency, assistance, for, sites, in, danger, offering, technical, assistance, and, professional, training, and, supporting, states, parties, public, awareness, building, activities, being, listed, as, a, world, heritage, site, can, positively, affect, the, site, its, environment, and, interactions, between, them, a, listed, site, gains, international, recognition, and, legal, protection, and, can, obtain, funds, from, among, others, the, world, heritage, fund, to, facilitate, its, conservation, under, certain, conditions, unesco, reckons, the, restorations, of, the, following, four, sites, among, its, success, stories, angkor, in, cambodia, the, old, city, of, dubrovnik, in, croatia, the, wieliczka, salt, mine, near, krak, w, in, poland, and, the, ngorongoro, conservation, area, in, tanzania, additionally, the, local, population, around, a, site, may, benefit, from, significantly, increased, tourism, revenue, when, there, are, significant, interactions, between, people, and, the, natural, environment, these, can, be, recognised, as, cultural, landscapes, a, country, must, first, identify, its, significant, cultural, and, natural, sites, in, a, document, known, as, the, tentative, list, next, it, can, place, sites, selected, from, that, list, into, a, nomination, file, which, is, evaluated, by, the, international, council, on, monuments, and, sites, and, the, world, conservation, union, a, country, may, not, nominate, sites, that, have, not, been, first, included, on, its, tentative, list, the, two, international, bodies, make, recommendations, to, the, world, heritage, committee, for, new, designations, the, committee, meets, once, a, year, to, determine, which, nominated, properties, to, add, to, the, world, heritage, list, sometimes, it, defers, its, decision, or, requests, more, information, from, the, country, that, nominated, the, site, there, are, ten, selection, criteria, a, site, must, meet, at, least, one, to, be, included, on, the, list, until, 2004, there, were, six, sets, of, criteria, for, cultural, heritage, and, four, for, natural, heritage, in, 2005, unesco, modified, these, and, now, has, one, set, of, ten, criteria, nominated, sites, must, be, of, outstanding, universal, value, and, must, meet, at, least, one, of, the, ten, criteria, a, country, may, request, to, extend, or, reduce, the, boundaries, modify, the, official, name, or, change, the, selection, criteria, of, one, of, its, already, listed, sites, any, proposal, for, a, significant, boundary, change, or, to, modify, the, site, s, selection, criteria, must, be, submitted, as, if, it, were, a, new, nomination, including, first, placing, it, on, the, tentative, list, and, then, onto, the, nomination, file, a, request, for, a, minor, boundary, change, one, that, does, not, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, extent, of, the, property, or, affect, its, outstanding, universal, value, is, also, evaluated, by, the, advisory, bodies, before, being, sent, to, the, committee, such, proposals, can, be, rejected, by, either, the, advisory, bodies, or, the, committee, if, they, judge, it, to, be, a, significant, change, instead, of, a, minor, one, proposals, to, change, a, site, s, official, name, are, sent, directly, to, the, committee, a, site, may, be, added, to, the, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, if, conditions, threaten, the, characteristics, for, which, the, landmark, or, area, was, inscribed, on, the, world, heritage, list, such, problems, may, involve, armed, conflict, and, war, natural, disasters, pollution, poaching, or, uncontrolled, urbanisation, or, human, development, this, danger, list, is, intended, to, increase, international, awareness, of, the, threats, and, to, encourage, counteractive, measures, threats, to, a, site, can, be, either, proven, imminent, threats, or, potential, dangers, that, could, have, adverse, effects, on, a, site, the, state, of, conservation, for, each, site, on, the, danger, list, is, reviewed, yearly, after, this, the, committee, may, request, additional, measures, delete, the, property, from, the, list, if, the, threats, have, ceased, or, consider, deletion, from, both, the, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, and, the, world, heritage, list, only, three, sites, have, ever, been, delisted, the, arabian, oryx, sanctuary, in, oman, the, dresden, elbe, valley, in, germany, and, the, liverpool, maritime, mercantile, city, in, the, united, kingdom, the, arabian, oryx, sanctuary, was, directly, delisted, in, 2007, instead, of, first, being, put, on, the, danger, list, after, the, omani, government, decided, to, reduce, the, protected, area, s, size, by, 90, the, dresden, elbe, valley, was, first, placed, on, the, danger, list, in, 2006, when, the, world, heritage, committee, decided, that, plans, to, construct, the, waldschl, sschen, bridge, would, significantly, alter, the, valley, s, landscape, in, response, the, dresden, city, council, attempted, to, stop, the, bridge, s, construction, however, after, several, court, decisions, allowed, the, building, of, the, bridge, to, proceed, the, valley, was, removed, from, the, world, heritage, list, in, 2009, liverpool, s, world, heritage, status, was, revoked, in, july, 2021, following, developments, liverpool, waters, and, bramley, moore, dock, stadium, on, the, northern, docks, of, the, world, heritage, site, leading, to, the, irreversible, loss, of, attributes, on, the, site, the, first, global, assessment, to, quantitatively, measure, threats, to, natural, world, heritage, sites, found, that, 63, of, sites, have, been, damaged, by, increasing, human, pressures, including, encroaching, roads, agriculture, infrastructure, and, settlements, over, the, last, two, decades, these, activities, endanger, natural, world, heritage, sites, and, could, compromise, their, unique, values, of, the, natural, world, heritage, sites, that, contain, forest, 91, experienced, some, loss, since, 2000, many, of, them, are, more, threatened, than, previously, thought, and, require, immediate, conservation, action, the, destruction, of, cultural, assets, and, identity, establishing, sites, is, one, of, the, primary, goals, of, modern, asymmetrical, warfare, terrorists, rebels, and, mercenary, armies, deliberately, smash, archaeological, sites, sacred, and, secular, monuments, and, loot, libraries, archives, and, museums, the, un, united, nations, peacekeeping, and, unesco, in, cooperation, with, blue, shield, international, are, active, in, preventing, such, acts, no, strike, lists, are, also, created, to, protect, cultural, assets, from, air, strikes, the, founding, president, of, blue, shield, international, karl, von, habsburg, summed, it, up, with, the, words, without, the, local, community, and, without, the, local, participants, that, would, be, completely, impossible, the, unesco, administered, project, has, attracted, criticism, this, was, caused, by, perceived, under, representation, of, heritage, sites, outside, europe, disputed, decisions, on, site, selection, and, adverse, impact, of, mass, tourism, on, sites, unable, to, manage, rapid, growth, in, visitor, numbers, a, large, lobbying, industry, has, grown, around, the, awards, because, world, heritage, listing, can, significantly, increase, tourism, returns, site, listing, bids, are, often, lengthy, and, costly, putting, poorer, countries, at, a, disadvantage, eritrea, s, efforts, to, promote, asmara, are, one, example, in, 2016, the, australian, government, was, reported, to, have, successfully, lobbied, for, the, world, heritage, site, great, barrier, reef, conservation, efforts, to, be, removed, from, a, unesco, report, titled, world, heritage, and, tourism, in, a, changing, climate, the, australian, government, s, actions, involving, considerable, expense, for, lobbying, and, visits, for, diplomats, were, in, response, to, their, concern, about, the, negative, impact, that, an, at, risk, label, could, have, on, tourism, revenue, at, a, previously, designated, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2021, international, scientists, recommended, unesco, to, put, the, great, barrier, reef, on, the, endangered, list, as, global, climate, change, had, caused, a, further, negative, state, of, the, corals, and, water, quality, again, the, australian, government, campaigned, against, this, and, in, july, 2021, the, world, heritage, committee, made, up, of, diplomatic, representatives, of, 21, countries, ignored, unesco, s, assessment, based, on, studies, of, scientists, that, the, reef, was, clearly, in, danger, from, climate, change, and, so, should, be, placed, on, the, list, according, to, environmental, protection, groups, this, decision, was, a, victory, for, cynical, lobbying, and, australia, as, custodians, of, the, world, s, biggest, coral, reef, was, now, on, probation, several, listed, locations, such, as, casco, viejo, in, panama, and, h, i, an, in, vietnam, have, struggled, to, strike, a, balance, between, the, economic, benefits, of, catering, to, greatly, increased, visitor, numbers, after, the, recognition, and, preserving, the, original, culture, and, local, communities, another, criticism, is, that, there, is, a, homogeneity, to, these, sites, which, contain, similar, styles, visitor, centres, etc, meaning, that, a, lot, of, the, individuality, of, these, sites, has, been, removed, to, become, more, attractive, to, tourists, anthropologist, jasper, chalcraft, said, that, world, heritage, recognition, often, ignores, contemporary, local, usage, of, certain, sites, this, leads, to, conflicts, on, the, local, level, which, can, result, in, the, site, being, damaged, rock, art, under, world, heritage, protection, at, the, tadrart, acacus, in, libya, have, occasionally, been, intentionally, destroyed, chalcraft, links, this, destruction, to, libyan, national, authorities, prioritizing, world, heritage, status, over, local, sensibilities, by, limiting, access, to, the, sites, without, consulting, with, the, local, population, unesco, has, also, been, criticized, for, alleged, geographic, bias, racism, and, colourism, in, world, heritage, inscription, a, major, chunk, of, all, world, heritage, inscriptions, are, located, in, regions, whose, populations, generally, have, lighter, skin, including, europe, east, asia, and, north, america, the, world, heritage, committee, has, divided, the, world, into, five, geographic, regions, africa, arab, states, asia, and, the, pacific, europe, and, north, america, and, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, russia, and, the, caucasus, states, are, classified, as, european, while, mexico, and, the, caribbean, are, classified, as, belonging, to, the, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, region, the, unesco, geographic, regions, also, give, greater, emphasis, on, administrative, rather, than, geographic, associations, hence, gough, island, located, in, the, south, atlantic, is, part, of, the, europe, and, north, america, region, because, the, british, government, nominated, the, site, the, table, below, includes, a, breakdown, of, the, sites, according, to, these, regions, and, their, classification, as, of, july, 2024, this, overview, lists, the, 23, countries, with, 15, or, more, world, heritage, sites
