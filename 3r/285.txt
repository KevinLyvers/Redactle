the, azores, z, r, z, zorz, us, also, e, z, r, z, ay, zorz, portuguese, a, ores, portuguese, pronunciation, officially, the, autonomous, region, of, the, azores, regi, o, aut, noma, dos, a, ores, is, one, of, the, two, autonomous, regions, of, portugal, along, with, madeira, it, is, an, archipelago, composed, of, nine, volcanic, islands, in, the, macaronesia, region, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, about, 1, 400, km, 870, mi, west, of, lisbon, about, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, northwest, of, morocco, and, about, 1, 930, km, 1, 200, mi, southeast, of, newfoundland, canada, its, main, industries, are, agriculture, dairy, farming, livestock, fishing, and, tourism, which, has, become, a, major, service, activity, in, the, region, in, the, 20th, century, and, to, some, extent, into, the, 21st, they, have, served, as, a, waypoint, for, refueling, aircraft, flying, between, europe, and, north, america, the, government, of, the, azores, employs, a, large, percentage, of, the, population, directly, or, indirectly, in, the, service, and, tertiary, sectors, the, largest, city, of, the, azores, is, ponta, delgada, the, culture, dialect, cuisine, and, traditions, of, the, azorean, islands, vary, considerably, because, these, remote, islands, were, settled, sporadically, over, a, span, of, two, centuries, there, are, nine, major, azorean, islands, and, an, islet, cluster, in, three, main, groups, these, are, flores, and, corvo, to, the, west, graciosa, terceira, s, o, jorge, pico, and, faial, in, the, centre, and, s, o, miguel, santa, maria, and, the, formigas, islets, to, the, east, they, extend, for, more, than, 600, km, 370, mi, and, lie, in, a, northwest, southeast, direction, all, of, the, islands, have, volcanic, origins, although, some, such, as, santa, maria, have, had, no, recorded, activity, in, the, time, since, the, islands, were, settled, several, centuries, ago, mount, pico, on, the, island, of, pico, is, the, highest, point, in, portugal, at, 2, 351, m, 7, 713, ft, if, measured, from, their, base, at, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, to, their, peaks, the, azores, are, among, the, tallest, mountains, on, the, planet, the, azores, are, located, at, the, seismically, active, azores, triple, junction, plate, boundary, where, the, north, american, plate, eurasian, plate, and, nubian, plate, meet, the, climate, of, the, azores, is, very, mild, for, such, a, northerly, location, being, influenced, by, its, distance, from, the, continents, and, by, the, passing, gulf, stream, because, of, the, marine, influence, temperatures, remain, mild, year, round, daytime, temperatures, normally, fluctuate, between, 16, and, 25, c, 61, and, 77, f, depending, on, season, temperatures, above, 30, c, 86, f, or, below, 3, c, 37, f, are, unknown, in, the, major, population, centres, it, is, also, generally, wet, and, cloudy, a, small, number, of, alleged, hypogea, underground, structures, carved, into, rocks, have, been, identified, on, the, islands, of, corvo, santa, maria, and, terceira, by, portuguese, archaeologist, nuno, ribeiro, who, speculated, that, they, might, date, back, 2, 000, years, implying, a, human, presence, on, the, island, before, the, portuguese, these, structures, have, been, used, by, settlers, in, the, azores, to, store, grain, and, the, suggestion, by, ribeiro, that, they, might, be, burial, sites, is, unconfirmed, detailed, examination, and, dating, to, authenticate, the, validity, of, these, speculations, is, lacking, thus, it, is, unclear, whether, these, structures, are, natural, or, human, made, and, whether, they, predate, the, 15th, century, portuguese, colonization, of, the, azores, according, to, a, 2015, paper, published, in, journal, of, evolutionary, biology, research, based, on, mouse, mitochondrial, dna, points, to, a, scandinavian, rather, than, portuguese, origin, of, the, local, mouse, population, a, 2021, paper, published, in, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, using, data, from, lake, sediment, core, sampling, suggests, brush, clearing, was, undertaken, and, animal, husbandry, introduced, between, 700, and, 850, a, d, these, findings, suggest, a, brief, period, of, norse, settlement, and, the, 2021, paper, further, cites, climate, simulations, that, suggest, the, dominant, winds, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, in, that, period, blew, from, the, northeast, which, would, have, taken, viking, ships, heading, southwest, from, scandinavia, more, or, less, directly, to, the, azores, the, islands, were, known, to, europeans, in, the, 14th, century, parts, of, them, appear, in, the, catalan, atlas, created, in, 1375, in, 1427, a, captain, sailing, for, prince, henry, the, navigator, possibly, gon, alo, velho, may, have, rediscovered, the, azores, but, this, is, not, certain, in, thomas, ashe, s, 1813, work, a, history, of, the, azores, the, author, identified, a, fleming, joshua, vander, berg, of, bruges, who, made, landfall, in, the, archipelago, during, a, storm, on, his, way, to, lisbon, according, to, ashe, the, portuguese, explored, the, area, and, claimed, it, for, portugal, other, writers, note, the, discovery, of, the, first, islands, s, o, miguel, santa, maria, and, terceira, by, sailors, in, the, service, of, henry, the, navigator, although, there, are, few, documents, to, support, such, claims, although, it, is, commonly, said, that, the, archipelago, received, its, name, from, a, or, portuguese, for, goshawk, a, common, bird, at, the, time, of, discovery, it, is, unlikely, that, the, bird, ever, nested, or, hunted, on, the, islands, there, were, no, large, animals, on, santa, maria, after, its, discovery, and, before, settlement, began, sheep, were, let, loose, on, the, island, to, supply, future, settlers, with, food, the, archipelago, was, largely, settled, from, mainland, portugal, but, settlement, did, not, take, place, right, away, gon, alo, velho, cabral, gathered, resources, and, settlers, for, the, next, three, years, 1433, 1436, and, sailed, to, establish, colonies, first, on, santa, maria, and, then, on, s, o, miguel, settlers, built, houses, established, villages, and, cleared, bush, and, rocks, to, plant, crops, grain, grapevines, sugar, cane, and, other, plants, suitable, for, local, use, and, for, export, they, brought, domesticated, animals, such, as, chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and, pigs, the, settlement, of, the, unoccupied, islands, started, in, 1439, with, people, mainly, from, the, continental, provinces, of, algarve, and, alentejo, in, mainland, portugal, s, o, miguel, was, first, settled, in, 1449, the, settlers, mainly, from, the, estremadura, alto, alentejo, and, algarve, areas, of, mainland, portugal, under, the, command, of, gon, alo, velho, cabral, who, landed, at, the, site, of, modern, day, povoa, o, the, first, reference, to, the, island, of, s, o, jorge, was, made, in, 1439, but, the, date, of, discovery, is, unknown, in, 1443, the, island, was, already, inhabited, but, settlement, began, only, after, the, arrival, of, the, noble, flemish, native, willem, van, der, haegen, arriving, at, topo, s, o, jorge, where, he, lived, and, died, he, became, known, as, guilherme, da, silveira, to, the, islanders, jo, o, vaz, corte, real, received, the, captaincy, of, the, island, in, 1483, velas, became, a, town, before, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, by, 1490, there, were, 2, 000, flemings, living, on, the, islands, of, terceira, pico, faial, s, o, jorge, and, flores, because, there, was, such, a, large, flemish, settlement, the, azores, became, known, as, the, flemish, islands, or, the, isles, of, flanders, prince, henry, the, navigator, was, responsible, for, this, flemish, settlement, his, sister, isabel, was, married, to, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, flanders, at, the, time, belonging, to, burgundy, there, was, a, revolt, against, philip, s, rule, and, disease, and, hunger, became, rampant, isabel, appealed, to, henry, to, allow, some, of, the, unruly, flemings, to, settle, in, the, azores, he, granted, this, and, supplied, them, with, means, of, transport, and, goods, in, 1522, vila, franca, do, campo, then, the, capital, of, s, o, miguel, was, devastated, by, an, earthquake, and, landslide, that, killed, about, 5, 000, people, and, the, capital, was, moved, to, ponta, delgada, the, town, of, vila, franca, do, campo, was, rebuilt, on, the, original, site, and, today, is, a, thriving, fishing, and, yachting, port, ponta, delgada, received, its, city, status, in, 1546, from, the, first, settlement, the, pioneers, applied, themselves, to, agriculture, and, by, the, 15th, century, graciosa, was, exporting, wheat, barley, wine, and, brandy, the, goods, were, sent, to, terceira, largely, because, of, the, proximity, of, that, island, portugal, fell, into, a, dynastic, crisis, following, the, death, of, cardinal, king, henry, of, portugal, in, 1580, of, the, various, claimants, to, the, crown, the, most, powerful, was, king, phillip, ii, of, spain, who, justified, his, rights, to, the, portuguese, throne, by, the, fact, that, his, mother, was, a, portuguese, royal, princess, his, maternal, grandfather, having, been, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, following, his, proclamation, in, santar, m, ant, nio, prior, of, crato, was, acclaimed, in, the, azores, in, 1580, through, his, envoy, ant, nio, da, costa, but, was, expelled, from, the, continent, by, the, spaniards, following, the, battle, of, alc, ntara, yet, through, the, administration, of, cipriano, de, figueiredo, governor, of, terceira, who, continued, to, govern, terceira, in, the, name, of, ill, fated, former, king, sebastian, of, portugal, the, azoreans, resisted, spanish, attempts, to, conquer, the, islands, including, specifically, at, the, battle, of, salga, in, 1583, philip, ii, of, spain, as, king, of, portugal, sent, his, fleet, to, clear, the, azores, of, a, combined, multinational, force, of, adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers, and, soldiers, who, were, attempting, to, establish, the, azores, as, a, staging, post, for, a, rival, pretender, to, the, portuguese, throne, following, the, success, of, his, fleet, at, the, battle, of, ponta, delgada, captured, enemies, were, hanged, from, yardarms, as, they, were, considered, pirates, by, philip, ii, opponents, receiving, the, news, variously, portrayed, philip, ii, as, a, despot, or, black, legend, the, sort, of, insult, widely, made, against, contemporary, monarchs, engaged, in, aggressive, empire, building, and, the, european, wars, of, religion, figueiredo, and, violante, do, canto, helped, organize, a, resistance, on, terceira, that, influenced, some, of, the, response, of, the, other, islands, even, as, internal, politics, and, support, for, philip, s, faction, increased, on, the, other, islands, including, specifically, on, s, o, miguel, where, the, gon, alvez, da, c, mara, family, supported, the, spanish, claimant, an, english, raid, of, the, azores, in, 1589, successfully, plundered, some, islands, and, harbouring, ships, eight, years, later, a, second, raid, failed, the, islands, voyage, spain, held, the, azores, under, the, iberian, union, from, 1580, to, 1642, called, the, babylonian, captivity, in, the, azores, the, azores, were, the, last, part, of, the, portuguese, empire, to, resist, philip, s, reign, over, portugal, macau, resisted, any, official, recognition, until, the, defeat, of, forces, loyal, to, the, prior, of, crato, with, the, conquest, of, the, azores, in, 1583, portuguese, control, resumed, with, the, end, of, the, iberian, union, in, 1640, and, the, beginning, of, the, portuguese, restoration, war, not, by, the, professional, military, who, were, occupied, with, warfare, on, the, portuguese, mainland, but, by, local, people, attacking, a, fortified, castilian, garrison, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, azores, and, madeira, began, to, face, problems, of, overpopulation, responding, to, the, consequent, economic, problems, some, people, of, the, azores, began, to, emigrate, to, the, united, states, canada, and, brazil, in, 1902, the, dominion, line, began, operating, a, mediterranean, passenger, service, between, boston, and, italy, via, gibraltar, and, the, azores, with, an, established, port, of, call, at, sao, miguel, in, 1904, the, service, was, taken, over, by, the, white, star, line, future, owners, of, the, ill, fated, titanic, four, ships, formerly, owned, by, dominion, were, renamed, and, put, into, service, under, white, star, named, canopic, romanic, cretic, and, republic, the, latter, of, which, is, best, known, for, its, 1909, sinking, off, the, new, england, coast, canopic, and, romanic, provided, regular, services, to, boston, while, cretic, and, republic, operated, on, the, service, to, both, new, york, and, boston, throughout, their, careers, by, the, time, the, service, ended, in, 1921, these, four, ships, had, transported, an, estimated, total, of, 58, 000, azorean, portuguese, to, the, united, states, the, portuguese, civil, war, 1828, 1834, had, strong, repercussions, in, the, azores, in, 1829, in, praia, da, vit, ria, the, liberals, won, over, the, absolutists, making, terceira, island, the, main, headquarters, of, the, new, portuguese, regime, and, also, where, the, council, of, regency, conselho, de, reg, ncia, of, maria, ii, of, portugal, was, established, beginning, in, 1868, portugal, issued, its, stamps, overprinted, with, a, ores, for, use, in, the, islands, between, 1892, and, 1906, it, also, issued, separate, stamps, for, the, three, administrative, districts, of, the, time, from, 1836, to, 1976, the, archipelago, was, divided, into, three, districts, equivalent, except, in, area, to, those, in, the, portuguese, mainland, the, division, was, arbitrary, and, did, not, follow, the, natural, island, groups, rather, reflecting, the, location, of, each, district, capital, on, the, three, main, cities, none, of, which, were, on, the, western, group, in, 1931, the, azores, together, with, madeira, and, portuguese, guinea, revolted, against, the, ditadura, nacional, and, were, held, briefly, by, rebel, military, in, 1943, during, world, war, ii, the, portuguese, ruler, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, leased, air, and, naval, bases, in, the, azores, to, great, britain, the, occupation, of, these, facilities, in, october, 1943, was, codenamed, operation, alacrity, by, the, british, this, was, a, key, turning, point, in, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, enabling, the, royal, air, force, the, u, s, army, air, forces, and, the, u, s, navy, to, provide, aerial, coverage, in, the, mid, atlantic, gap, this, helped, them, to, protect, convoys, and, to, hunt, hostile, german, u, boats, in, 1944, the, u, s, constructed, a, small, and, short, lived, air, base, on, the, island, of, santa, maria, in, 1945, a, new, base, was, constructed, on, the, island, of, terceira, named, lajes, field, this, air, base, is, in, an, area, called, lajes, a, broad, flat, sea, terrace, that, had, been, a, large, farm, lajes, field, is, a, plateau, rising, out, of, the, sea, on, the, northeast, corner, of, the, island, this, air, base, is, a, joint, american, and, portuguese, venture, lajes, field, continues, to, support,

submarines, and, surface, warships, since, its, opening, lajes, field, has, been, used, for, refuelling, american, cargo, planes, bound, for, europe, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, u, s, navy, keeps, a, small, squadron, of, its, ships, at, the, harbor, of, praia, da, vit, ria, three, km, 1, 9, mi, southeast, of, lajes, field, the, airfield, also, has, a, small, commercial, terminal, handling, scheduled, and, chartered, passenger, flights, from, the, other, islands, in, the, azores, europe, africa, and, north, america, following, the, carnation, revolution, of, 1974, which, deposed, the, estado, novo, dictatorship, in, lisbon, portugal, and, its, territories, across, the, world, entered, into, a, period, of, great, political, uncertainty, the, azorean, liberation, front, attempted, to, take, advantage, of, this, instability, immediately, after, the, revolution, hoping, to, establish, an, independent, azores, until, operations, ceased, in, 1975, in, 1976, the, azores, became, the, autonomous, region, of, the, azores, regi, o, aut, noma, dos, a, ores, one, of, the, autonomous, regions, of, portugal, and, the, subdistricts, of, the, azores, were, eliminated, in, 2003, the, azores, saw, international, attention, when, united, states, president, george, w, bush, british, prime, minister, tony, blair, spanish, prime, minister, jos, mar, a, aznar, and, portuguese, prime, minister, jos, manuel, dur, o, barroso, held, a, summit, there, days, before, the, commencement, of, the, iraq, war, the, archipelago, of, the, azores, is, located, in, the, middle, of, the, northern, hemisphere, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, extends, along, a, west, northwest, to, east, southeast, orientation, between, 36, 5, 40, north, latitudes, and, 24, 5, 31, 5, west, longitudes, in, an, area, approximately, 600, km, 373, mi, wide, the, islands, of, the, azores, emerged, from, what, is, called, the, azores, plateau, a, 5, 8, million, km, 2, region, that, is, morphologically, accented, by, a, depth, of, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, the, nine, islands, that, compose, the, archipelago, occupy, a, surface, area, of, 2, 346, km, 2, 906, sq, mi, that, includes, both, the, main, islands, and, many, islets, located, in, their, vicinities, they, range, in, surface, area, from, the, largest, s, o, miguel, at, 759, km, 2, 293, sq, mi, to, the, smallest, corvo, at, approximately, 17, km, 2, 7, sq, mi, each, of, the, islands, has, its, own, distinct, geomorphological, characteristics, that, make, them, unique, these, islands, can, be, divided, into, three, recognizable, groups, located, on, the, azores, plateau, s, o, jorge, pico, and, faial, are, also, collectively, called, ilhas, do, tri, ngulo, islands, of, the, triangle, several, sub, surface, reefs, particularly, the, dollabarat, on, the, fringe, of, the, formigas, banks, specifically, the, princess, alice, bank, and, d, jo, o, de, castro, bank, as, well, as, many, hydrothermal, vents, and, sea, mounts, are, monitored, by, the, regional, authorities, owing, to, the, complex, geotectonic, and, socioeconomic, significance, within, the, economic, exclusion, zone, of, the, archipelago, from, a, geostructural, perspective, the, azores, are, located, above, an, active, triple, junction, between, three, of, the, world, s, major, tectonic, plates, the, north, american, plate, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, african, plate, a, condition, that, has, translated, into, the, existence, of, many, faults, and, fractures, in, this, region, of, the, atlantic, the, westernmost, islands, of, the, archipelago, corvo, and, flores, are, located, on, the, north, american, plate, while, the, remaining, islands, are, located, within, the, boundary, that, divides, the, eurasian, and, african, plates, the, principal, tectonic, structures, that, exist, in, the, region, of, the, azores, are, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, the, terceira, rift, the, azores, fracture, zone, and, the, gl, ria, fault, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, is, the, main, frontier, between, the, north, american, plate, and, the, african, eurasian, plates, that, crosses, the, azores, plateau, between, the, islands, of, flores, and, faial, from, north, to, south, then, to, the, southwest, it, is, an, extensive, form, crossed, by, many, transform, faults, running, perpendicular, to, its, north, south, orientation, that, is, seismically, active, and, susceptible, to, volcanism, the, azores, features, a, series, of, prominent, peaks, with, montanha, do, pico, also, known, as, mount, pico, standing, as, the, highest, at, 2, 351, meters, on, pico, island, other, notable, elevations, include, pico, da, vara, on, s, o, miguel, island, pico, da, esperan, a, on, s, o, jorge, island, cabe, o, gordo, on, faial, island, and, calderia, de, santa, barbara, on, terceira, island, the, terceira, rift, is, a, system, of, fractures, that, extends, from, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, to, the, gl, ria, fault, that, represents, the, main, frontier, between, the, eurasian, and, african, plates, it, is, defined, by, a, line, of, submarine, volcanoes, and, island, mounts, that, extend, northwest, to, southeast, for, about, 550, km, 342, mi, from, the, area, west, of, graciosa, until, the, islets, of, the, formigas, that, includes, the, islands, of, graciosa, terceira, and, s, o, miguel, its, northwest, limit, connects, to, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, while, the, southeast, section, intersects, the, gloria, fault, southeast, of, the, island, of, santa, maria, the, azores, fracture, zone, extends, from, the, gl, ria, fault, and, encompasses, a, relatively, inactive, area, to, the, south, of, the, islands, of, the, central, and, eastern, groups, north, to, the, terceira, rift, along, a, 45, angle, the, gl, ria, fault, for, its, part, extends, 800, km, 497, mi, along, a, linear, line, from, the, azores, to, the, azores, gibraltar, transform, fault, the, islands, volcanism, is, associated, with, the, rifting, along, the, azores, triple, junction, the, spread, of, the, crust, along, the, existing, faults, and, fractures, has, produced, many, of, the, active, volcanic, and, seismic, events, while, supported, by, buoyant, upwelling, in, the, deeper, mantle, some, associate, with, an, azores, hotspot, most, of, the, volcanic, activity, has, centered, primarily, along, the, terceira, rift, from, the, beginning, of, the, islands, settlement, around, the, 15th, century, there, have, been, 28, registered, volcanic, eruptions, 15, terrestrial, and, 13, submarine, the, last, significant, volcanic, eruption, the, capelinhos, volcano, vulc, o, dos, capelinhos, occurred, off, the, coast, of, the, island, of, faial, in, 1957, the, most, recent, volcanic, activity, occurred, in, the, seamounts, and, submarine, volcanoes, off, the, coast, of, serreta, and, in, the, pico, s, o, jorge, channel, the, islands, have, many, examples, of, volcano, built, geomorphology, including, caves, and, lava, tubes, such, as, the, gruta, das, torres, algar, do, carv, o, gruta, do, natal, gruta, das, cinco, ribeiras, the, coastal, lava, fields, like, the, coast, of, feteiras, faial, the, mist, rio, of, prainha, or, s, o, jo, o, on, pico, island, in, addition, to, the, inactive, cones, in, central, s, o, miguel, island, the, aforementioned, capelinhos, on, faial, the, volcanic, complexes, of, terceira, or, plinian, caldeira, of, corvo, island, the, islands, of, the, archipelago, were, formed, through, volcanic, and, seismic, activity, during, the, neogene, period, the, first, embryonic, surfaces, started, to, appear, in, the, waters, of, santa, maria, during, the, miocene, epoch, from, circa, 8, million, years, ago, the, sequence, of, the, island, formation, has, been, generally, characterized, as, santa, maria, 8, 12, ma, s, o, miguel, 4, 1, ma, terceira, 3, 52, ma, graciosa, 2, 5, ma, flores, 2, 16, ma, faial, 0, 7, ma, s, o, jorge, 0, 55, ma, corvo, 0, 7, ma, and, the, youngest, pico, 0, 27, ma, all, islands, have, experienced, volcanism, during, their, geological, history, with, late, holocene, volcanism, being, recorded, from, flores, and, faial, within, recorded, human, settlement, history, the, islands, of, santa, maria, graciosa, flores, and, corvo, have, not, experienced, any, volcanic, eruptions, in, addition, to, active, fumaroles, and, hot, springs, the, remaining, islands, have, had, sporadic, eruptions, since, the, 14th, century, apart, from, the, capelinhos, volcano, in, 1957, 1958, the, last, recorded, instance, of, island, formation, occurred, off, the, coast, of, s, o, miguel, when, the, island, of, sabrina, was, briefly, formed, owing, to, its, geodynamic, environment, the, region, has, been, a, center, of, intense, seismic, activity, particularly, along, its, tectonic, boundaries, on, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, and, terceira, rift, seismic, events, although, frequent, are, usually, tectonic, or, vulco, tectonic, in, nature, but, in, general, are, of, low, to, medium, intensities, occasionally, punctuated, by, events, of, level, 5, or, greater, on, the, richter, magnitude, scale, the, most, severe, earthquake, was, registered, in, 1757, near, calheta, on, the, island, of, s, o, jorge, which, exceeded, 7, on, the, richter, magnitude, scale, in, comparison, the, 1522, earthquake, that, was, mentioned, by, historian, gaspar, frutuoso, measured, 6, 8, but, its, effects, were, judged, to, be, x, extreme, on, the, mercalli, intensity, scale, and, was, responsible, for, the, destruction, of, vila, franca, do, campo, and, landslides, that, may, have, killed, more, than, 5, 000, of, the, inhabitants, the, archipelago, lies, in, the, palearctic, realm, and, has, a, unique, biotic, community, that, includes, the, macaronesian, subtropical, laurissilva, with, many, endemic, species, of, plants, and, animals, there, are, at, least, 6, 112, terrestrial, species, of, which, about, 411, are, endemic, the, majority, 75, of, these, endemics, are, animals, mostly, arthropods, and, mollusks, new, species, are, found, regularly, in, the, azores, e, g, 30, different, new, species, of, land, snails, were, discovered, circa, 2013, even, though, the, azores, look, very, green, and, sometimes, wild, the, vegetation, has, been, extremely, altered, a, great, part, of, it, has, been, wiped, out, in, the, past, 600, years, for, its, valuable, wood, for, tools, buildings, boats, fire, wood, and, so, on, and, to, clear, land, for, agriculture, as, a, result, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, half, of, insects, on, the, graciosa, island, have, disappeared, or, will, become, extinct, many, cultivated, places, which, are, traditionally, dedicated, to, pasture, or, to, growing, taro, potatoes, maize, and, other, crops, have, now, been, abandoned, especially, as, a, result, of, emigration, consequently, some, invasive, plants, have, filled, these, deserted, and, disturbed, lands, hydrangeas, are, another, potential, pest, but, their, threat, is, less, serious, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, hydrangeas, were, introduced, from, america, or, asia, some, locals, consider, them, a, symbol, of, the, archipelago, and, propagate, them, along, roadsides, cryptomeria, the, japanese, cedar, is, a, conifer, extensively, grown, for, its, timber, the, two, most, common, of, these, alien, species, are, pittosporum, undulatum, and, hedychium, gardnerianum, reforestation, efforts, with, native, laurissilva, vegetation, have, been, accomplished, successfully, in, many, parts, of, the, azores, the, azores, has, at, least, two, endemic, living, bird, species, the, azores, bullfinch, or, priolo, is, restricted, to, remnant, laurisilva, forest, in, the, mountains, at, the, eastern, end, of, s, o, miguel, and, is, classified, by, birdlife, international, as, endangered, monteiro, s, storm, petrel, described, to, science, as, recently, as, 2008, is, known, to, breed, in, just, two, locations, in, the, islands, but, may, occur, more, widely, an, extinct, species, of, owl, the, s, o, miguel, scops, owl, has, recently, been, described, which, probably, became, extinct, after, human, settlement, because, of, habitat, destruction, and, the, introduction, of, alien, species, five, species, of, flightless, rail, rallus, spp, once, existed, on, the, islands, as, did, a, flightless, quail, coturnix, sp, and, another, species, of, bullfinch, the, greater, azores, bullfinch, but, these, also, went, extinct, after, human, colonization, eleven, subspecies, of, bird, are, endemic, to, the, islands, the, azores, has, an, endemic, bat, the, azores, noctule, which, has, an, unusually, high, frequency, of, diurnal, flight, the, islets, of, the, formigas, the, portuguese, word, for, ants, including, the, area, known, as, the, dollabarat, reef, have, a, rich, environment, of, maritime, species, such, as, black, coral, and, manta, rays, different, species, of, sharks, whales, and, sea, turtles, seventeen, new, marine, reserves, with, special, conservation, status, were, added, to, the, azorean, marine, park, which, covers, around, 900, 000, km, 2, 350, 000, sq, mi, on, s, o, miguel, there, are, notable, micro, habitats, formed, by, hot, springs, that, host, extremophile, microorganisms, the, archipelago, is, spread, out, at, roughly, the, same, latitude, as, the, southern, half, of, mainland, portugal, but, its, location, in, the, mid, atlantic, ocean, gives, it, a, generally, tepid, oceanic, mild, to, warm, subtropical, climate, with, mild, annual, oscillations, the, azores, archipelago, is, located, in, a, transition, and, confrontation, zone, between, air, masses, of, tropical, origin, and, masses, of, cooler, air, of, polar, origin, the, climate, of, the, archipelago, is, largely, determined, by, variations, in, the, atmospheric, pressure, field, over, the, north, atlantic, these, variations, conditioned, by, the, mass, of, the, american, continent, and, the, atlantic, water, mass, are, overlapped, by, a, semi, permanent, subtropical, atlantic, anticyclone, commonly, known, as, the, azores, high, this, anticyclone, experiences, seasonal, variations, which, can, affect, the, archipelago, in, many, ways, in, winter, the, azores, anticyclone, is, positioned, further, south, and, allows, for, a, descent, of, the, polar, front, approaching, it, to, the, archipelago, in, summer, on, the, other, hand, the, anticyclone, s, movement, further, north, leads, to, the, departure, of, the, polar, front, and, its, associated, disturbances, towards, higher, latitudes, far, enough, away, from, the, mainland, coasts, the, continental, air, masses, that, reach, the, archipelago, are, weakened, by, the, maritime, influence, the, same, can, not, be, said, for, the, higher, altitudes, e, g, mount, pico, where, upper, air, masses, of, a, continental, origin, and, with, a, more, direct, pathway, can, reach, the, surface, and, present, those, areas, with, drier, air, and, more, extreme, temperatures, at, the, same, time, this, free, atmosphere, circulating, air, transports, aerosols, to, the, archipelago, namely, volcanic, ash, or, fine, sands, from, the, sahara, desert, which, sporadically, affect, the, radiation, and, air, quality, daily, maximum, temperatures, at, low, altitudes, usually, range, between, 16, and, 25, c, 61, and, 77, f, the, average, annual, rainfall, generally, increases, from, east, to, west, ranging, from, 700, mm, 28, in, in, santa, maria, to, 1, 600, mm, 63, in, in,

usually, classified, as, mediterranean, while, the, central, and, western, group, especially, flores, and, corvo, is, increasingly, more, humid, subtropical, and, overall, rainier, because, of, the, effects, of, the, gulf, stream, this, stream, has, a, large, effect, over, the, sea, temperature, which, varies, between, 16, c, 61, f, in, february, and, march, and, 23, c, 73, f, in, august, and,

though, september, is, usually, as, warm, or, warmer, than, july, although, temperatures, as, warm, as, 32, 1, c, 89, 8, f, have, been, recorded, on, pico, neither, ponta, delgada, nor, angra, do, hero, smo, the, two, largest, cities, have, ever, been, warmer, than, 30, c, 86, f, there, has, never, been, a, frost, snowfall, freeze, or, even, temperatures, below, 5, c, 41, f, recorded, at, sea, level, on, any, of, the, islands, the, coldest, weather, in, winter, usually, comes, from, northwesterly, air, masses, originating, from, labrador, in, canada, however, since, those, air, masses, are, warmed, up, as, they, pass, across, the, warmer, atlantic, ocean, temperatures, by, day, even, then, exceed, 10, c, 50, f, the, average, relative, humidity, can, range, from, 80, at, the, coast, to,

august, and, may, increase, the, perceived, temperature, by, a, few, degrees, winters, are, not, only, very, mild, but, also, very, humid, and, contribute, substantially, to, the, annual, precipitation, insolation, is, relatively, low, with, 35, 40, of, the, total, possible, value, for, sunshine, and, higher, in, topographically, lower, islands, such, as, graciosa, or, santa, maria, inversely, proportional, to, precipitation, this, is, directly, caused, by, the, orographic, lift, of, humid, air, masses, and, is, especially, pronounced, in, islands, marked, by, high, orography, with, a, greater, rarity, especially, in, late, summer, and, autumn, despite, the, northern, position, that, the, archipelago, occupies, the, azores, can, be, affected, by, the, passage, of, tropical, cyclones, or, tropical, storms, derived, from, them, some, can, result, from, anomalies, of, low, latitude, systems, while, others, result, from, the, return, back, to, the, atlantic, after, a, route, close, to, or, even, over, the, american, continent, though, often, small, and, in, the, process, of, dissipation, these, cyclones, result, in, many, of, the, worst, storms, the, archipelago, is, subject, to, a, total, of, 14, tropical, or, subtropical, cyclones, have, affected, the, region, in, history, most, of, them, were, either, extratropical, or, tropical, storms, when, they, affected, the, region, although, several, category, 1, hurricanes, have, reached, the, azores, the, following, storms, have, impacted, the, region, while, at, category, 1, strength, several, tropical, storms,
