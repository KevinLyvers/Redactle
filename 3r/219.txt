vygozero, as, of, 2008, it, carries, only, light, traffic, of, between, ten, and, forty, boats, per, day, its, economic, advantages, are, limited, by, its, minimal, depth, of, 3, 5, m, 11, 5, ft, inadequate, for, most, seagoing, vessels, this, depth, typically, corresponds, to, river, craft, with, deadweight, cargo, up, to, 600, tonnes, while, useful, seagoing, vessels, of, 2, 000, 3, 000, dwt, typically, have, drafts, of, 4, 5, 6, m, 15, 20, ft, the, canal, was, originally, proposed, to, be, 5, 4, m, 17, 7, ft, deep, however, the, cost, and, time, constraints, of, stalin, s, first, five, year, plan, forced, the, much, shallower, draught, the, total, length, of, the, waterway, is, 227, km, 141, mi, of, which, 48, km, 30, mi, are, man, made, the, current, flows, north, from, lake, onega, to, the, white, sea, and, all, navigation, marks, are, set, according, to, it, once, in, lake, onega, ships, can, exit, the, southwest, shore, through, the, svir, river, and, its, two, locks, to, reach, lake, ladoga, and, then, proceed, down, the, neva, river, to, saint, petersburg, and, the, baltic, sea, alternatively, from, lake, onega, river, ships, can, sail, eastward, into, the, volga, baltic, waterway, the, canal, begins, near, povenets, settlement, in, povenets, bay, of, lake, onega, after, povenets, there, are, seven, locks, close, together, forming, the, stairs, of, povenets, these, locks, are, the, southern, slope, of, the, canal, the, canal, summit, pond, at, 103, m, elevation, is, 22, km, 14, mi, long, between, locks, 7, 8, the, northern, slope, has, twelve, locks, numbered, 8, 19, the, route, of, the, northern, slope, runs, through, five, large, lakes, lake, matkozero, between, locks, 8, 9, lake, vygozero, between, locks, 9, 10, lake, palagorka, between,

success, of, the, first, five, year, plan, its, construction, was, completed, four, months, ahead, of, schedule, though, it, was, too, shallow, for, the, planned, use, the, canal, was, constructed, in, twenty, months, between, 1931, and, 1933, almost, entirely, by, manual, labor, the, canal, was, the, first, major, project, constructed, in, the, soviet, union, using, forced, labor, bblag, the, directorate, of, the, bbk, camps, managed, the, construction, supplying, a, workforce, of, an, estimated, 100, 000, convicts, at, the, cost, of, huge, casualties, although, prison, labor, camps, were, usually, kept, secret, the, white, sea, canal, was, a, propaganda, showcase, of, convicts, reforging, themselves, in, useful, labor, soviet, concept, of, perekovka, reforging, or, rehabilitation, marshall, berman, states, that, the, canal, was, a, triumph, of, publicity, but, if, half, the, care, that, went, into, the, public, relations, campaign, had, been, devoted, to, the, work, itself, there, would, have, been, far, fewer, victims, and, far, more, development, the, workforce, for, the, canal, was, supplied, by, the, belbaltlag, camp, directorate, white, sea, baltic, corrective, labor, camp, directorate, wsbc, of, the, ogpu, gulag, genrikh, yagoda, deputy, chairman, of, the, ogpu, as, well, as, berman, firin, kogan, and, rappoport, were, awarded, the, order, of, lenin, for, the, completion, of, the, canal, by, the, politburo, on, july, 15, 1933, the, soviets, portrayed, the, project, as, evidence, of, the, efficiency, of, the, gulag, supposedly, reforging, class, enemies, political, prisoners, through, corrective, labor, the, working, conditions, at, the, bbk, camp, were, brutal, with, the, prisoners, given, only, primitive, hand, tools, to, carry, out, the, massive, construction, project, the, mortality, rate, was, about, 8, 7, with, many, more, sick, and, disabled, the, workforce, was, organized, into, brigades, of, 25, 30, which, made, up, phalanges, of, 250, 300, there, were, norms, for, labor, for, example, 2, 5, m, 3, 3, 3, cu, yd, of, hand, dug, stone, per, day, per, brigade, there, was, an, extensive, system, of, incentives, for, prisoners,

of, work, and, for, shock, workers, a, day, in, two, at, other, times, these, teams, were, pitted, to, compete, against, each, other, in, surpassing, the, norms, and, promises, were, made, of, shortened, sentences, food, and, cash, bonuses, for, the, champions, after, the, successful, construction, 12, 484, prisoners, were, freed, as, reward, and, 59, 516, prison, terms, were, shortened, 12, 300, workers, died, during, the, building, process, according, to, the, official, records, including, in, 1931, 1438, 2, 24, of, the, number, of, workers, in, 1932, 2010, 2, 03, in, 1933, 8870, 10, 56, which, was, due, to, a, reduction, in, supplies, due, to, famine, in, the, country, and, the, rush, before, the, completion, of, construction, while, anne, applebaum, s, estimate, is, 25, 000, deaths, a, carefully, prepared, visit, in, august, 1933, to, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, may, have, hidden, the, worst, of, the, brutality, from, a, group, of, 120, russian, writers, and, artists, the, so, called, writers, brigade, including, maxim, gorky, aleksey, nikolayevich, tolstoy, viktor, shklovsky, and, mikhail, zoshchenko, who, compiled, a, work, in, praise, of, the, project, the, 600,

navigation, lights, were, switched, to, electric, power, the, importance, of, bbk, for, the, national, economy, greatly, increased, after, the, commissioning, of, the, modern, volga, baltic, waterway, in, 1964, canal, capacity, and, the, annual, volume, of, freight, traffic, increased, several, fold, another, upgrade, took, place, in, the, 1970s, during, the, reconstruction, the, guaranteed, depth, of, the, fairway, was, increased, to, 4, meters, and, the, channel, became, part, of, the, unified, deep, water, system, of, european, russia, during, the, first, navigation, in, 1933, 1, 143, million, tons, of, cargo, and, 27, 000, passengers, were, transported, through, the, canal, in, 1940, traffic, volume, was, approximately, 1, million, tons, representing, 44, of, capacity, cargo, tonnage, peaked, in, 1985, with, 7, 3, million, tonnes, transported, tonnage, remained, high, until, 1990, then, declined, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, usage, rose, gradually, in, the, 21st, century, but, remained, well, below, the, soviet, era, peak, with, just, 0, 3, million, tonnes, in, 2002, during, the, 2007, season, the, canal, carried, 0, 4, million, tonnes, of, cargo, along, with, 2, 500, passengers, it, is, now, operated, by, the, white, sea, and, lake, onega, waterways, and, shipping, administration, which, is, also, responsible, for, shipping, on, lake, onega, and, in, the, belomorsk, harbor, area, but, not, in, the, open, waters, of, the, white, sea, the, canal, was, seemingly, a, small, part, of, the, agency, s, overall, shipping, business, which, in, 2007, amounted, to, 4, 6, million, tonnes, and, 155, 000, passengers, according, to, official, statistics, a, total, of, 193, million, tonnes, of, cargo, was, transported, over, the, canal, over, its, first, 75, years, 1933, 2008, the, canal, makes, it, possible, to, ship, heavy, and, bulky, items, from, russia, s, industrial, centers, to, the, white, sea, and, then, by, sea, going, vessels, to, siberia, s, northern, ports, for, example, in, the, summer, of, 2007, a, large, piece, of, equipment, for, rosneft, s, siberian, vankor, oil, field, was, delivered, by, the, amur, 1516, from, dzerzhinsk, on, the, oka, river, via, the, volga, baltic, waterway, and, the, white, sea, canal, to, arkhangelsk, and, from, there, by, the, ocean, going, sa, 15, class, arctic, cargo, ship, kapitan, danilkin, to, dudinka, on, the, yenisei, river, in, 2011, heavy, equipment, for, the, sayano, shushenskaya, hydro, power, plant, was, shipped, from, saint, petersburg, via, the, canal, the, arctic, sea, and, the, yenisei, river, in, soviet, times, the, canal, was, used, for, shipping, oil, products, from, refineries, on, the, volga, river, to, consumers, in, the, murmansk, oblast, and, overseas, russia, s, volgotanker, company, with, a, fleet, of, suitably, sized, petroleum, tankers, and, ore, bulk, oil, carriers, pioneered, this, route, starting, august, 1970, when, nefterudovoz, 3, delivered, a, cargo, of, fuel, oil, to, the, white, sea, port, of, kandalaksha, after, many, years, of, interruption, volgotanker, resumed, the, canal, route, in, 2003, the, company, had, plans, to, carry, 800, 000, tonnes, of, fuel, oil, over, the, canal, during, 2003, and, to, increase, the, volume, to, 1, 500, 000, t, 1, 476, 000, long, tons, 1, 653, 000, short, tons, in, 2004, the, fuel, was, transferred, from, volgotanker, river, tankers, to, latvian, seagoing, tankers, at, a, floating, transfer, station, near, the, osinki, island, in, the, onega, bay, on, the, white, sea, 36, km, 22, mi, northwest, of, the, port, of, onega, transfer, operations, began, 24, june, 2003, but, on, 1, september, a, low, speed, collision, between, volgotanker, s, nefterudovoz, 57m, and, the, latvian, zoja, i, during, a, transfer, caused, a, crack, in, the, nefterudovoz, s, hull, with, a, subsequent, oil, spillage, estimated, at, 45, t, 44, long, tons, 50, short, tons, of, which, only, 9, t, 8, 9, long, tons, 9, 9, short, tons, were, recovered, volgotanker, s, alleged, failure, to, contain, the, spill, resulted, in, the, arkhangelsk, oblast, authorities, shutting, down, the, oil, transfer, operation, with, only, 220, 000, tonnes, exported, the, company, was, fined, and, future, operations, were, refused, soviet, and, later, russian, naval, strategists, long, believed, that, a, well, designed, canal, system, could, help, establish, contact, among, the, separate, fleets, based, on, russia, s, black, sea, baltic, arctic, pacific, and, caspian, coasts, the, white, sea, canal, was, also, constructed, with, this, military, use, in, mind, and, early, in, its, history, the, northern, fleet, s, first, warships, sailed, along, the, canal, to, the, white, sea, from, the, baltic, before, world, war, ii, the, canal, was, used, for, the, transfer, of, military, vessels, between, the, two, seas, on, 17, occasions, during, world, war, ii, in, august, september, 1941, the, canal, was, used, to, move, a, number, of, submarines, from, the, baltic, fleet, to, the, white, sea, including, submarines, k, 3, s, 101, and, s, 102, l, 22, some, unfinished, submarines, from, leningrad, s, baltic, shipyard, and, gorky, s, krasnoye, sormovo, shipyard, sailed, to, the, new, sevmash, shipyard, in, severodvinsk, since, then, the, canal, has, been, regularly, used, for, delivering, submarines, by, transporter, dock, from, the, baltic, shipyard, and, krasnoye, sormovo, to, sevmash, for, completion, the, canal, system, includes, five, hydroelectric, power, plants, with, total, production, capacity, of, 240, mw, the, canal, gave, its, name, to, the, belomorkanal, soviet, cigarette, brand, there, is, a, monument, at, povenets, for, the, prisoners, who, perished, during, the, construction, and, a, smaller, memorial, in, belomorsk, near, the, white, sea, end, there, was, even, a, comedic, play, written, about, the, canal, by, nikolay, pogodin, the, canal, project, also, gave, the, russian, language, the, slang, word, zeka, zek, z, k, for, inmate, in, russian, inmate, incarcerated, is, zakliuchyonnyi, usually, abbreviated, to, in, paperwork, and, pronounced, as, ipa,
