was, a, way, to, hide, the, black, population, not, only, from, the, census, but, also, from, public, opinion, chile, does, not, ask, its, citizens, about, race, but, a, study, from, the, university, of, chile, concluded, that, whites, make, 60, of, the, chilean, population, while, the, cia, world, factbook, described, 88, 4, of, the, population, as, white, and, mestizo, a, study, conducted, on, 218, individuals, in, 2010, by, the, argentine, geneticist, daniel, corach, has, established, that, the, genetic, map, of, argentina, is, composed, of, 79, different, european, ethnicities, mainly, spanish, and, italian, ethnicities, 18, of, different, indigenous, ethnicities, and, 4, 3, of, african, ethnic, groups, in, which, 63, 6, of, the, tested, group, had, at, least, one, ancestor, who,

the, same, level, in, this, area, even, considering, that, it, faces, restrictions, to, its, industrial, and, economic, growth, the, southern, cone, is, the, most, prosperous, macro, region, in, latin, america, it, has, a, high, life, expectancy, and, access, to, health, care, and, education, from, an, economic, and, liberal, point, of, view, the, region, has, been, praised, for, its,
