when, people, had, largely, stopped, living, in, caves, during, ancient, times, gibraltar, was, regarded, by, the, peoples, of, the, mediterranean, as, a, place, of, religious, and, symbolic, importance, the, phoenicians, were, present, for, several, centuries, since, around, 950, bc, apparently, using, gorham, s, cave, as, a, shrine, to, the, genius, loci, as, did, the, carthaginians, and, romans, after, them, gibraltar, was, known, as, mons, calpe, a, name, perhaps, of, phoenician, origin, mons, calpe, was, considered, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, as, one, of, the, pillars, of, hercules, after, the, greek, legend, of, the, creation, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, by, heracles, there, is, no, known, archaeological, evidence, of, permanent, settlements, from, the, ancient, period, they, settled, at, the, head, of, the, bay, in, what, is, today, known, as, the, campo, hinterland, of, gibraltar, the, town, of, carteia, near, the, location, of, the, modern, spanish, town, of, san, roque, was, founded, by, the, phoenicians, around, 950, bc, on, the, site, of, an, early, settlement, of, the, native, turdetani, people, after, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, gibraltar, came, briefly, under, the, control, of, the, vandals, who, crossed, into, africa, at, the, invitation, of, boniface, the, count, or, commander, of, the, territory, the, area, later, formed, part, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, hispania, for, almost, 300, years, from, 414, until, 711, ad, following, a, raid, in, 710, a, predominantly, berber, army, under, the,
