the, pre, islamic, and, early, islamic, eras, c, 1000, and, earlier, central, asia, was, inhabited, predominantly, by, iranian, people, populated, by, eastern, iranian, speaking, bactrians, sogdians, chorasmians, and, the, semi, nomadic, scythians, and, dahae, after, expansion, by, turkic, people, central, asia, also, became, the, homeland, for, the, uzbeks, kazakhs, tatars, turkmens, kyrgyz, and, uyghurs, turkic, languages, largely, replaced, the, iranian, languages, spoken, in, the, area, with, the, exception, of, tajikistan, and, areas, where, tajik, is, spoken, the, silk, road, trade, routes, crossed, through, central, asia, leading, to, the, rise, of, prosperous, trade, cities, acting, as, a, crossroads, for, the, movement, of, people, goods, and, ideas, between, europe, and, the, far, east, most, countries, in, central, asia, are, still, integral, to, parts, of, the, world, economy, from, the, mid, 19th, century, until, almost, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, central, asia, was, colonised, by, the, russians, and, incorporated, into, the, russian, empire, and, later, the, soviet, union, which, led, to, russians, and, other, slavs, emigrating, into, the, area, modern, day, central, asia, is, home, to, a, large, population, of, european, settlers, who, mostly, live, in, kazakhstan, 7, million, russians, 500, 000, ukrainians, and, about, 170, 000, germans, stalinist, era,

kyrgyzstan, 7, million, tajikistan, 10, million, turkmenistan, 6, million, and, uzbekistan, 35, million, one, of, the, first, geographers, to, mention, central, asia, as, a, distinct, region, of, the, world, was, alexander, von, humboldt, the, borders, of, central, asia, are, subject, to, multiple, definitions, historically, political, geography, and, culture, have, been, two, significant, parameters, widely, used, in, scholarly, definitions, of, central, asia, humboldt, s, definition, comprised, every, country, between, 5, north, and, 5, south, of, the, latitude, 44, 5, n, humboldt, mentions, some, geographic, features, of, this, region, which, include, the, caspian, sea, in, the, west, the, altai, mountains, in, the, north, and, the, hindu, kush, and, pamir, mountains, in, the, south, he, did, not, give, an, eastern, border, for, the, region, his, legacy, is, still, seen, humboldt, university, of, berlin, named, after, him, offers, a, course, in, central, asian, studies, the, russian, geographer, nikola, khanykov, questioned, the, latitudinal, definition, of, central, asia, and, preferred, a, physical, one, of, all, countries, located, in, the, region, landlocked, from, water, including, afghanistan, khorasan, northeast, iran, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, uyghuristan, xinjiang, mongolia, and, uzbekistan, russian, culture, has, two, distinct, terms, srednyaya, aziya, or, middle, asia, the, narrower, definition, which, includes, only, those, traditionally, non, slavic, central, asian, lands, that, were, incorporated, within, those, borders, of, historical, russia, and, tsentralnaya, aziya, or, central, asia, the, wider, definition, which, includes, central, asian, lands, that, have, never, been, part, of, historical, russia, the, latter, definition, includes, afghanistan, and, east, turkestan, the, most, limited, definition, was, the, official, one, of, the, soviet, union, which, defined, middle, asia, as, consisting, solely, of, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, omitting, kazakhstan, soon, after, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, leaders, of, the, four, former, soviet, central, asian, republics, met, in, tashkent, and, declared, that, the, definition, of, central, asia, should, include, kazakhstan, as, well, as, the, original, four, included, by, the, soviets, since, then, this, has, become, the, most, common, definition, of, central, asia, in, 1978, unesco, defined, the, region, as, afghanistan, north, eastern, iran, pakistan, northern, india, western, china, mongolia, and, the, soviet, central, asian, republics, an, alternative, method, is, to, define, the, region, based, on, ethnicity, and, in, particular, areas, populated, by, eastern, turkic, eastern, iranian, or, mongolian, peoples, these, areas, include, xinjiang, uyghur, autonomous, region, the, turkic, regions, of, southern, siberia, the, five, republics, and, afghan, turkestan, afghanistan, as, a, whole, the, northern, and, western, areas, of, pakistan, and, the, kashmir, valley, of, india, may, also, be, included, the, tibetans, and, ladakhis, are, also, included, most, of, the, mentioned,

with, the, steppes, of, eastern, europe, as, a, homogeneous, geographical, zone, known, as, the, eurasian, steppe, much, of, the, land, of, central, asia, is, too, dry, or, too, rugged, for, farming,

endorheic, basin, that, also, includes, the, caspian, sea, both, of, these, bodies, of, water, have, shrunk, significantly, in, recent, decades, due, to, the, diversion, of, water, from, rivers, that,

from, the, northeast, after, 1800, western, civilisation, in, its, russian, and, soviet, form, penetrated, from, the, northwest, because, central, asia, is, landlocked, and, not, buffered, by, a, large, body, of, water, temperature, fluctuations, are, often, severe, excluding, the, hot, sunny, summer, months, in, most, areas, the, climate, is, dry, and, continental, with, hot, summers, and, cool, to, cold, winters, with, occasional, snowfall, outside, high, elevation, areas, the, climate, is, mostly, semi, arid, to, arid, in, lower, elevations, summers, are, hot, with, blazing, sunshine,

september, rises, in, autumn, october, and, november, and, is, highest, in, march, or, april, followed, by, swift, drying, in, may, and, june, winds, can, be, strong, producing, dust, storms, sometimes, especially, toward, the, end, of, the, summer, in, september, and, october, specific, cities, that, exemplify, central, asian, climate, patterns, include, tashkent, and, samarkand, uzbekistan, ashgabat, turkmenistan, and, dushanbe, tajikistan, the, last, of, these, represents, one, of, the, wettest, climates, in, central, asia, with, an, average, annual, precipitation, of, over, 560, mm, 22, inches, biogeographically, central, asia, is, part, of, the, palearctic, realm, the, largest, biome, in, central, asia, is, the, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, central, asia, also, contains, the, montane, grasslands, and, shrublands, deserts, and, xeric, shrublands, and, temperate, coniferous, forests, biomes, as, of, 2022, there, has, been, a, scarcity, of, research, on, climate, impacts, in, central, asia, even, though, it, experiences, faster, warming, than, the, global, average, and, is, generally, considered, to, be, one, of, the, more, climate, vulnerable, regions, in, the, world, along, with, west, asia, it, has, already, had, greater, increases, in, hot, temperature, extremes, than, the, other, parts, of, asia, 1464, rainfall, in, central, asia, had, decreased, unlike, elsewhere, in, asia, and, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, dust, storms, had, grown, partly, due, to, poor, land, use, practices, droughts, have, already, become, more, likely, and, their, likelihood, is, expected, to, continue, increasing, with, greater, climate, change, 1465, by, 2050, people, in, the, amu, darya, basin, may, be, faced, with, severe, water, scarcity, due, to, both, climate, and, socioeconomic, reasons, 1486, although, during, the, golden, age, of, orientalism, the, place, of, central, asia, in, the, world, history, was, marginalised, contemporary, historiography, has, rediscovered, the, centrality, of, the, central, asia, the, history, of, central, asia, is, defined, by, the, area, s, climate, and, geography, the, aridness, of, the, region, made, agriculture, difficult, and, its, distance, from, the, sea, cut, it, off, from, much, trade, thus, few, major, cities, developed, in, the, region, instead, the, area, was, for, millennia, dominated, by, the, nomadic, horse, peoples, of, the, steppe, relations, between, the, steppe, nomads, and, the, settled, people, in, and, around, central, asia, were, long, marked, by, conflict, the, nomadic, lifestyle, was, well, suited, to, warfare, and, the, steppe, horse, riders, became, some, of, the, most, militarily, potent, people, in, the, world, limited, only, by, their, lack, of, internal, unity, any, internal, unity, that, was, achieved, was, most, probably, due, to, the, influence, of, the, silk, road, which, traveled, along, central, asia, periodically, great, leaders, or, changing, conditions, would, organise, several, tribes, into, one, force, and, create, an, almost, unstoppable, power, these, included, the, hun, invasion, of, europe, the, five, barbarians, rebellions, in, china, and, most, notably, the, mongol, conquest, of, much, of, eurasia, during, pre, islamic, and, early, islamic, times, central, asia, was, inhabited, predominantly, by, speakers, of, iranian, languages, among, the, ancient, sedentary, iranian, peoples, the, sogdians, and, chorasmians, played, an, important, role, while, iranian, peoples, such, as, scythians, and, the, later, on, alans, lived, a, nomadic, or, semi, nomadic, lifestyle, the, main, migration, of, turkic, peoples, occurred, between, the, 6th, and, 11th, centuries, when, they, spread, across, most, of, central, asia, the, eurasian, steppe, slowly, transitioned, from, indo, european, and, iranian, speaking, groups, with, dominant, west, eurasian, ancestry, to, a, more, heterogeneous, region, with, increasing, east, asian, ancestry, through, turkic, and, mongolian, groups, in, the, past, thousands, years, including, extensive, turkic, and, later, mongol, migrations, out, of, mongolia, and, slow, assimilation, of, local, populations, in, the, 8th, century, ad, the, islamic, expansion, reached, the, region, but, had, no, significant, demographic, impact, in, the, 13th, century, ad, the, mongolian, invasion, of, central, asia, brought, most, of, the, region, under, mongolian, influence, which, had, enormous, demographic, success, but, did, not, impact, the, cultural, or, linguistic, landscape, once, populated, by, iranian, tribes, and, other, indo, european, speaking, people, central, asia, experienced, numerous, invasions, emanating, out, of, southern, siberia, and, mongolia, that, would, drastically, affect, the, region, genetic, data, shows, that, the, different, central, asian, turkic, speaking, peoples, have, between, 22, and, 70, east, asian, ancestry, represented, by, baikal, hunter, gatherer, ancestry, shared, with, other, northeast, asians, and, eastern, siberians, in, contrast, to, iranian, speaking, central, asians, specifically, tajiks, which, display, genetic, continuity, to, indo, iranians, of, the, iron, age, certain, turkic, ethnic, groups, specifically, the, kazakhs, display, even, higher, east, asian, ancestry, this, is, explained, by, substantial, mongolian, influence, on, the, kazakh, genome, through, significant, admixture, between, blue, eyes, blonde, hair, the, medieval, kipchaks, of, central, asia, and, the, invading, medieval, mongolians, the, data, suggests, that, the, mongol, invasion, of, central, asia, had, lasting, impacts, onto, the, genetic, makeup, of, kazakhs, according, to, recent, genetic, genealogy, testing, the, genetic, admixture, of, the, uzbeks, clusters, somewhere, between, the, iranian, peoples, and, the, mongols, another, study, shows, that, the, uzbeks, are, closely, related, to, other, turkic, peoples, of, central, asia, and, rather, distant, from, iranian, people, the, study, also, analysed, the, maternal, and, paternal, dna, haplogroups, and, shows, that, turkic, speaking, groups, are, more, homogenous, than, iranian, speaking, groups, genetic, studies, analyzing, the, full, genome, of, uzbeks, and, other, central, asian, populations, found, that, about, 27, 60, of, the, uzbek, ancestry, is, derived, from, east, asian, sources, with, the, remainder, ancestry, 40, 73, being, made, up, by, european, and, middle, eastern, components, according, to, a, recent, study, the, kyrgyz, kazakhs, uzbeks, and, turkmens, share, more, of, their, gene, pool, with, various, east, asian, and, siberian, populations, than, with, west, asian, or, european, populations, though, the, turkmens, have, a, large, percentage, from, populations, to, the, east, their, main, components, are, central, asian, the, study, further, suggests, that, both, migration, and, linguistic, assimilation, helped, to, spread, the, turkic, languages, in, eurasia, the, tang, dynasty, of, china, expanded, westwards, and, controlled, large, parts, of, central, asia, directly, and, indirectly, through, their, turkic, vassals, tang, china, actively, supported, the, turkification, of, central, asia, while, extending, its, cultural, influence, the, tang, chinese, were, defeated, by, the, abbasid, caliphate, at, the, battle, of, talas, in, 751, marking, the, end, of, the, tang, dynasty, s, western, expansion, and, the, 150, years, of, chinese, influence, the, tibetan, empire, would, take, the, chance, to, rule, portions, of, central, asia, and, south, asia, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, the, mongols, conquered, and, ruled, the, largest, contiguous, empire, in, recorded, history, most, of, central, asia, fell, under, the, control, of, the, chagatai, khanate, the, dominance, of, the, nomads, ended, in, the, 16th, century, as, firearms, allowed, settled, peoples, to, gain, control, of, the, region, russia, china, and, other, powers, expanded, into, the, region, and, had, captured, the, bulk, of, central, asia, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, qing, dynasty, gained, control, of, east, turkestan, in, the, 18th, century, as, a, result, of, a, long, struggle, with, the, dzungars, the, russian, empire, conquered, the, lands, of, the, nomadic, kazakhs, turkmens, kyrgyz, and, central, asian, khanates, in, the, 19th, century, a, major, revolt, known, as, the, dungan, revolt, occurred, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, in, the, eastern, part, of, central, asia, and, qing, rule, almost, collapsed, in, all, of, east, turkestan, after, the, russian, revolution, the, western, central, asian, regions, were, incorporated, into, the, soviet, union, the, eastern, part, of, central, asia, known, as, xinjiang, was, incorporated, into, the, people, s, republic, of, china, having, been, previously, ruled, by, the, qing, dynasty, and, the, republic, of, china, mongolia, gained, its, independence, from, china, and, has, remained, independent, but, became, a, soviet, satellite, state, until, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, afghanistan, remained, relatively, independent, of, major, influence, by, the, soviet, union, until, the, saur, revolution, of, 1978, the, soviet, areas, of, central, asia, saw, much, industrialisation, and, construction, of, infrastructure, but, also, the, suppression, of, local, cultures, hundreds, of, thousands, of, deaths, from, failed, collectivisation, programmes, and, a, lasting, legacy, of, ethnic, tensions, and, environmental, problems, soviet, authorities, deported, millions, of, people, including, entire, nationalities, from, western, areas, of, the, soviet, union, to, central, asia, and, siberia, according, to, touraj, atabaki, and, sanjyot, mehendale, from, 1959, to, 1970, about, two, million, people, from, various, parts, of, the, soviet, union, migrated, to, central, asia, of, which, about, one, million, moved, to, kazakhstan, with, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, five, countries, gained, independence, that, is, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, the, historian, and, turkologist, peter, b, golden, explains, that, without, the, imperial, manipulations, of, the, russian, empire, but, above, all, the, soviet, union, the, creation, of, said, republics, would, have, been, impossible, in, nearly, all, the, new, states, former, communist, party, officials, retained, power, as, local, strongmen, none, of, the, new, republics, could, be, considered, functional, democracies, in, the, early, days, of, independence, although, in, recent, years, kyrgyzstan, kazakhstan, and, mongolia, have, made, further, progress, towards, more, open, societies, unlike, uzbekistan, tajikistan, and, turkmenistan, which, have, maintained, many, soviet, style, repressive, tactics, beginning, in, the, early, 2000s, the, chinese, government, engaged, in, a, series, of, human, rights, abuses, against, uyghurs, and, other, ethnic, and, religious, minorities, in, xinjiang, at, the, crossroads, of, asia, shamanistic, practices, live, alongside, buddhism, thus, yama, lord, of, death, was, revered, in, tibet, as, a, spiritual, guardian, and, judge, mongolian, buddhism, in, particular, was, influenced, by, tibetan, buddhism, the, qianlong, emperor, of, qing, china, in, the, 18th, century, was, tibetan, buddhist, and, would, sometimes, travel, from, beijing, to, other, cities, for, personal, religious, worship, central, asia, also, has, an, indigenous, form, of, improvisational, oral, poetry, that, is, over, 1000, years, old, it, is, principally, practiced, in, kyrgyzstan, and, kazakhstan, by, akyns, lyrical, improvisationalists, they, engage, in, lyrical, battles, the, aytysh, or, the, alym, sabak, the, tradition, arose, out, of, early, bardic, oral, historians, they, are, usually, accompanied, by, a, stringed, instrument, in, kyrgyzstan, a, three, stringed, komuz, and, in, kazakhstan, a, similar, two, stringed, instrument, the, dombra, photography, in, central, asia, began, to, develop, after, 1882, when, a, russian, mennonite, photographer, named, wilhelm, penner, moved, to, the, khanate, of, khiva, during, the, mennonite, migration, to, central, asia, led, by, claas, epp, jr, upon, his, arrival, to, khanate, of, khiva, penner, shared, his, photography, skills, with, a, local, student, khudaybergen, divanov, who, later, became, the, founder, of, uzbek, photography, some, also, learn, to, sing, the, manas, kyrgyzstan, s, epic, poem, those, who, learn, the, manas, exclusively, but, do, not, improvise, are, called, manaschis, during, soviet, rule, akyn, performance, was, co, opted, by, the, authorities, and, subsequently, declined, in, popularity, with, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, it, has, enjoyed, a, resurgence, although, akyns, still, do, use, their, art, to, campaign, for, political, candidates, a, 2005, the, washington, post, article, proposed, a, similarity, between, the, improvisational, art, of, akyns, and, modern, freestyle, rap, performed, in, the, west, as, a, consequence, of, russian, colonisation, european, fine, arts, painting, sculpture, and, graphics, have, developed, in, central, asia, the, first, years, of, the, soviet, regime, saw, the, appearance, of, modernism, which, took, inspiration, from, the, russian, avant, garde, movement, until, the, 1980s, central, asian, arts, had, developed, along, with, general, tendencies, of, soviet, arts, in, the, 90s, arts, of, the, region, underwent, some, significant, changes, institutionally, speaking, some, fields, of, arts, were, regulated, by, the, birth, of, the, art, market, some, stayed, as, representatives, of, official, views, while, many, were, sponsored, by, international, organisations, the, years, of, 1990, 2000, were, times, for, the, establishment, of, contemporary, arts, in, the, region, many, important, international, exhibitions, are, taking, place, central, asian, art, is, represented, in, european, and, american, museums, and, the, central, asian, pavilion, at, the, venice, biennale, has, been, organised, since, 2005, equestrian, sports, are, traditional, in, central, asia, with, disciplines, like, endurance, riding,
