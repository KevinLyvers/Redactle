antarctica, it, lies, in, the, bellingshausen, sea, west, of, palmer, land, antarctic, peninsula, from, which, it, is, separated, by, marguerite, bay, and, george, vi, sound, the, george, vi, ice, shelf, entirely, fills, george, vi, sound, and, connects, alexander, island, to, palmer, land, the, island, partly, surrounds, wilkins, sound, which, lies, to, its, west, alexander, island, is, about, 390, kilometres, 240, mi, long, in, a, north, south, direction, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, wide, in, the, north, and, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, wide, in, the, south, alexander, island, is, the, second, largest, uninhabited, island, in, the, world, after, devon, island, alexander, island, was, discovered, on, january, 28, 1821, by, a, russian, expedition, under, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, who, named, it, alexander, i, land, for, the, reigning, tsar, alexander, i, of, russia, what, in, fact, is, an, island, was, believed, to, be, part, of, the, antarctic, mainland, until, 1940, its, insular, nature, was, proven, in, december, 1940, by, a, two, person, sledge, party, composed, of, finn, ronne, and, carl, eklund, of, the, united, states, antarctic, service, in, the, 1950s, a, british, base, administered, as, part, of, the, british, antarctic, territory, was, constructed, as, fossil, bluff, base, kg, the, island, was, claimed, by, the, united, kingdom, in, 1908, as, part, of, the, british, antarctic, territory, territorial, claims, have, also, been, set, by, both, chile, in, 1940, and, argentina, in, 1942, currently, under, the, antarctic, treaty, no, claim, has, been, officially, recognized, the, island, contains, the, british, fossil, bluff, meteorological, centre, and, refuelling, base, the, surface, of, alexander, island, is, predominantly, ice, covered, there, exist, some, exposed, nunataks, and, a, few, ice, free, areas, of, significant, size, including, ablation, point, massif, the, nunataks, are, the, peaks, of, north, south, trending, mountain, ranges, and, hills, they, include, the, colbert, havre, lassus, rouen, sofia, university, and, walton, mountains, the, staccato, peaks, the, lully, foothills, the, finlandia, foothills, the, elgar, uplands, and, the, douglas, range, these, mountains, peaks, hills, and, uplands, are, surrounded, by, a, permanent, ice, sheet, which, consists, of, glaciers, that, flow, off, of, alexander, island, these, glaciers, flow, west, into, the, bach, and, wilkins, ice, shelves, and, bellingshausen, sea, and, east, into, the, george, vi, ice, shelf, the, george, vi, ice, shelf, is, fed, by, both, by, outlet, glaciers, from, the, ice, cap, on, palmer, land, and, alexander, island, another, notable, feature, of, alexander, island, is, hodgson, lake, a, former, subglacial, lake, that, has, emerged, from, under, an, ice, sheet, that, had, covered, it, hodgson, lake, is, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, long, by, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, and, has, a, 93, 4, m, 306, ft, deep, water, column, that, lies, sealed, beneath, a, 3, 6, to, 4, 0, m, 11, 8, to, 13, 1, ft, thick, perennial, lake, ice, the, northern, side, of, hodgson, lake, is, bounded, by, the, saturn, glacier, which, flows, east, into, george, vi, sound, while, the, southern, side, of, hodgson, lake, is, bounded, by, the, northern, face, of, citadel, bastion, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, hodgson, lake, was, covered, by, the, ice, sheet, at, least, 470, m, 1, 540, ft, thick, this, ice, sheet, started, thinning, about, 13, 500, years, ago, it, retreated, and, left, hodgson, lake, covered, by, perennial, ice, sometime, before, 11, 000, years, ago, this, lake, has, been, covered, by, perennial, ice, since, that, time, other, features, on, the, island, include, damocles, point, and, mount, tyrrell, brahms, inlet, 71, 28, s, 73, 41, w, 71, 467, s, 73, 683, w, 71, 467, 73, 683, is, an, ice, filled, inlet, 25, nautical, miles, 46, km, long, and, 6, nautical, miles, 11, km, wide, indenting, the, north, side, of, beethoven, peninsula, on, alexander, island, between, harris, peninsula, and, derocher, peninsula, while, the, headland, mazza, point, lies, immediately, northeast, of, the, inlet, and, mount, grieg, lies, immediately, southeast, of, the, base, of, brahms, inlet, it, was, observed, from, the, air, and, first, mapped, by, the, ronne, antarctic, research, expedition, rare, 1947, 48, and, re, mapped, from, the, rare, air, photos, by, derek, j, h, searle, of, the, falkland, islands, dependencies, survey, in, 1960, it, was, named, by, the, uk, antarctic, place, names, committee, after, johannes, brahms, the, german, composer, harris, peninsula, 71, 31, s, 74, 6, w, 71, 517, s, 74, 100, w, 71, 517, 74, 100, is, a, broad, snow, covered, peninsula, surmounted, by, mount, lee, between, verdi, inlet, and, brahms, inlet, on, the, north, side, of, the, beethoven, peninsula, located, in, the, southwest, portion, of, alexander, island, antarctica, it, is, one, of, eight, peninsulas, of, alexander, island, it, was, photographed, from, the, air, by, the, rare, 1947, 48, and, mapped, from, these, photographs, by, d, searle, of, the, falkland, islands, dependencies, survey, 1960, it, was, named, by, the, advisory, committee, on, antarctic, names, for, commander, michael, j, harris, u, s, navy, commanding, officer, of, squadron, vxe, 6, from, may, 1982, to, may, 1983, lyadov, glacier, 71, 32, 00, s, 73, 45, 00,

of, sciences, in, 1987, after, anatoly, lyadov, 1855, 1914, a, russian, composer, according, to, hole, the, geology, of, alexander, island, can, be, attributed, mainly, to, processes, associated, with, the, subduction, of, proto, pacific, oceanic, crust, along, the, western, margin, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, from, latest, triassic, to, late, tertiary, times, the, lemay, group, accretionary, prism, complex, along, with, plutonic, and, volcanic, rocks, are, prevalent, along, the, western, portion, of, the, island, the, lemay, group, consists, of, variably, deformed, and, metamorphosed, sedimentary, and, igneous, rocks, although, it, is, dominated, by, deformed, arkosic, sedimentary, rocks, it, includes, turbiditic, greywackes, black, mudstones, and, conglomerates,

miles, wide, belt, along, the, eastern, coast, this, fossil, bluff, group, consists, of, a, basal, deep, marine, assemblage, 2, 200, meters, 7, 200, feet, thick, overlain, by, a, mudstone, assemblage, up, to, 950, meters, 3, 120, feet, thick, followed, by, a, shallow, marine, assemblage, of, coarsening, upward, sandstones, alkali, basalts, erupted, after, the, cessation, of, subduction, these,

basalts, on, beethoven, peninsula, 1, 2, 5, ma, the, lemay, range, fault, trends, n, s, parallel, to, the, george, vi, sound, and, the, fossil, bluff, formation, is, downfaulted, to, the, east, of, this, fault, against, the, lemay, group, sand, dykes, are, found, against, this, fault, zone, and, in, many, other, parts, of, the, fossil, bay, formation, fossils, within, the, fossil, bluff,
