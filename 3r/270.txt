nusa, tenggara, or, southeast, islands, are, an, archipelago, in, indonesian, archipelago, most, of, the, lesser, sunda, islands, are, located, within, the, wallacea, region, except, for, the, bali, province, which, is, west, of, the, wallace, line, and, is, within, the, sunda, shelf, together, with, the, greater, sunda, islands, to, the, west, they, make, up, the, sunda, islands, the, islands, are, part, of, a, volcanic, arc, the, sunda, arc, formed, by, subduction, along, the, sunda, trench, in, the, java, sea, in, 1930, the, population, was, 3, 460, 059, today, slightly, over, 15, 5, million, people, live, on, the, islands, etymologically, nusa, tenggara, means, southeast, islands, from, the, words, of, nusa, which, means, island, from, old, javanese, language, and, tenggara, means, southeast, the, main, lesser, sunda, islands, are, from, west, to, east, bali, lombok, sumbawa, flores, sumba, savu, rote, timor, atauro, alor, archipelago, barat, daya, islands, and, tanimbar, islands, apart, from, the, eastern, half, of, timor, island, and, atauro, island, which, are, part, of, the, nation, of, timor, leste, all, the, other, islands, are, part, of, indonesia, the, lesser, sunda, islands, consist, of, two, geologically, distinct, archipelagos, the, northern, archipelago, which, includes, bali, lombok, sumbawa, flores, and, wetar, is, volcanic, in, origin, a, number, of, these, volcanoes, like, mount, rinjani, on, lombok, are, still, active, while, others, such, as, ilikedeka, on, flores, are, extinct, the, northern, archipelago, began, to, be, formed, during, the, pliocene, about, 15, million, years, ago, as, a, result, of, the, collision, between, the, australian, and, the, asian, plates, the, islands, of, the, southern, archipelago, including, sumba, timor, and, babar, are, non, volcanic, and, appear, to, belong, to, the, australian, plate, the, geology, and, ecology, of, the, northern, archipelago, share, similar, history, characteristics, and, processes, with, the, southern, maluku, islands, which, continue, the, same, island, arc, to, the, east, there, is, a, long, history, of, geological, study, of, these, regions, since, indonesian, colonial, times, however, the, geological, formation, and, progression, is, not, fully, understood, and, theories, of, the, geological, evolution, of, the, islands, changed, extensively, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, lying, at, the, collision, of, two, tectonic, plates, the, lesser, sunda, islands, comprise, some, of, the, most, geologically, complex, and, active, regions, in, the, world, the, province, of, bali, is, the, only, part, of, nusa, tenggara, located, on, the, sunda, shelf, and, that, is, not, within, the, wallacea, region, and, that, is, west, of, the, wallace, line, there, are, a, number, of, volcanoes, located, on, the, lesser, sunda, islands, the, lesser, sunda, islands, differ, from, the, large, islands, of, java, or, sumatra, in, consisting, of, many, small, islands, sometimes, divided, by, deep, oceanic, trenches, movement, of, flora, and, fauna, between, islands, is, limited, leading, to, the, evolution, of, a, high, rate, of, localized, species, most, famously, the, komodo, dragon, as, described, by, alfred, wallace, in, the, malay, archipelago, the, wallace, line, passes, between, bali, and, lombok, along, the, deep, waters, of, the, lombok, strait, which, formed, a, water, barrier, even, when, lower, sea, levels, linked, the, now, separated, islands, and, landmasses, on, either, side, the, islands, east, of, the, lombok, strait, are, part, of, wallacea, and, are, thus, characterised, by, a, blend, of, wildlife, of, asian, and, australasian, origin, in, this, region, asian, species, predominate, in, the, lesser, sundas, weber, s, line, which, marks, the, boundary, between, the, parts, of, wallacea, with, mainly, asian, and, australasian, species, respectively, runs, to, the, east, of, the, group, these, islands, have, the, driest, climate, in, indonesia, and, tropical, dry, broadleaf, forests, are, predominant, in, contrast, to, the, tropical, moist, forests, that, prevail, in, most, of, indonesia, the, lesser, sunda, islands, are, divided, among, six, ecoregions, more, than, half, of, the, original, vegetation, of, the, islands, has, been, cleared, for, planting, of, rice, and, other, crops, for, settlement, and, by, consequent, forest, fires, only, sumbawa, now, contains, a, large, area, of, intact, natural, forest, while, komodo, rincah, and, padar, are, now, protected, as, komodo, national, park, while, many, ecological, problems, affect, both, small, islands, and, large, landmasses, small, islands, suffer, their, particular, problems, and, are, highly, exposed, to, external, forces, development, pressures, on, small, islands, are, increasing, although, their, effects, are, not, always, anticipated, although, indonesia, is, richly, endowed, with, natural, resources, the, resources, of, the, small, islands, of, nusa, tenggara, are, limited, and, specialised, furthermore, human, resources, in, particular, are, limited, general, observations, about, small, islands, that, can, be, applied, to, nusa, tenggara, include, the, lesser, sundas, comprise, many, islands, stretching, east, of, java, most, of, which, are, part, of, indonesia, and, from, 1945, were, administered, apart, from, the, easternmost, islands, which, have, been, always, administered, as, part, of, maluku, province, as, the, lesser, sunda, islands, sunda, kecil, province, of, indonesia, later, called, nusa, tenggara, in, 1958, this, was, split, into, three, new, provinces, as, the, provinces, of, bali, west, nusa, tenggara, and, east, nusa, tenggara, the, eastern, half, of, timor, island, is, the, separate, nation, of, east, timor, officially, timor, leste, religion, in, lesser, sunda, islands, december, 2023
