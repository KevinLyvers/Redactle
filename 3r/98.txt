zambia, and, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, it, makes, up, 110, kilometres, 68, mi, of, the, total, length, of, the, congo, lying, between, its, luapula, river, upstream, and, luvua, river, downstream, segments, mweru, means, lake, in, a, number, of, bantu, languages, so, it, is, often, referred, to, as, just, mweru, mweru, is, mainly, fed, by, the, luapula, river, which, comes, in, through, swamps, from, the, south, and, the, kalungwishi, river, from, the, east, at, its, north, end, the, lake, is, drained, by, the, luvua, river, which, flows, in, a, northwesterly, direction, to, join, the, lualaba, river, and, thence, to, the, congo, it, is, the, second, largest, lake, in, the, congo, s, drainage, basin, and, is, located, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, west, of, the, southern, end, of, the, largest, lake, tanganyika, the, luapula, forms, a, swampy, delta, almost, as, wide, as, the, southern, end, of, the, lake, in, a, number, of, respects, the, lower, river, and, lake, can, be, treated, as, one, entity, for, a, lake, in, a, region, with, pronounced, wet, and, dry, seasons, mweru, does, not, change, much, in, level, and, area, the, annual, fluctuation, in, level, is, 1, 7, metres, 5, ft, 7, in, with, seasonal, highs, in, may, and, lows, in, january, this, is, partly, because, the, luapula, drains, out, of, the, bangweulu, swamps, and, floodplain, which, tend, to, regulate, the, water, flow, absorbing, the, annual, flood, and, releasing, it, slowly, and, partly, because, mweru, s, outlet, the, luvua, drops, quickly, and, flows, swiftly, without, vegetation, to, block, it, a, rise, in, mweru, is, quickly, offset, by, a, faster, flow, down, the, luvua, mweru, s, average, length, is, 118, kilometres, 73, mi, and, its, average, width, is, 45, kilometres, 28, mi, with, its, long, axis, oriented, northeast, southwest, its, elevation, is, 917, metres, 3, 009, ft, quite, a, bit, higher, than, tanganyika, 763, metres, 2, 503, ft, it, is, a, rift, valley, lake, lying, in, the, lake, mweru, luapula, graben, which, is, a, branch, of, the, east, african, rift, the, western, shore, of, the, lake, in, dr, congo, exhibits, the, steep, escarpment, typical, of, a, rift, valley, lake, rising, to, the, kundelungu, mountains, beyond, but, the, rift, valley, escarpment, is, less, pronounced, on, the, eastern, shore, mweru, is, shallow, in, the, south, and, deeper, in, the, north, with, two, depressions, in, the, north, eastern, section, with, maximum, depths, of, 20, and, 27, metres, 66, and, 89, ft, a, smaller, very, marshy, lake, called, mweru, wantipa, also, known, as, the, mweru, marshes, lies, about, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, to, its, east, and, north, of, the, kalungwishi, it, is, mostly, endorheic, and, actually, takes, water, from, the, kalungwishi, through, a, dambo, most, of, the, time, but, in, times, of, high, flood, it, may, overflow, into, the, kalungwishi, and, lake, mweru, the, lake, was, known, to, arab, and, swahili, traders, of, ivory, copper, and, slaves, who, used, kilwa, island, on, the, lake, as, a, base, at, one, time, they, used, trade, routes, from, zanzibar, on, the, indian, ocean, to, ujiji, on, lake, tanganyika, to, mweru, and, then, to, the, lunda, luba, yeke, or, kazembe, kingdoms, the, last, being, on, the, southern, shores, of, mweru, western, trade, routes, went, from, those, kingdoms, to, the, atlantic, so, mweru, lay, on, a, transcontinental, trade, route, between, 1796, and, 1831, portuguese, traders, explorers, pereira, francisco, de, lacerda, and, others, visited, kazembe, from, mozambique, to, get, treaties, to, use, the, trade, route, between, their, territories, of, mozambique, and, angola, the, portuguese, must, have, known, of, the, lake, and, the, visitors, only, had, to, walk, to, higher, ground, about, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, north, of, kazembe, s, kanyembo, capital, to, see, the, lake, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, distant, however, they, were, more, interested, in, trade, routes, than, discovery, they, had, approached, from, the, south, and, their, movements, were, restricted, by, mwata, kazembe, and, they, did, not, provide, an, account, of, it, explorer, and, missionary, david, livingstone, who, referred, to, it, as, moero, is, credited, with, its, discovery, during, his, travels, of, 1867, 8, livingstone, witnessed, the, devastation, and, suffering, caused, by, the, slave, trade, in, the, area, to, the, north, and, east, of, mweru, and, his, accounts, did, help, rally, opposition, to, it, the, last, of, the, slave, trading, in, the, area, was, as, late, as, the, 1890s, however, meanwhile, between, 1870, and, 1891, skirmishes, and, wars, between, the, yeke, king, msiri, and, neighbouring, chiefs, and, traders, unsettled, the, area, few, europeans, had, visited, mweru, since, livingstone, until, alfred, sharpe, in, 1890, 1, and, the, stairs, expedition, in, 1892, both, passed, by, on, their, way, to, seek, treaties, with, msiri, the, stairs, expedition, killed, msiri, and, took, katanga, for, the, king, leopold, ii, of, belgium, sharpe, left, one, of, his, officers, to, set, up, the, first, colonial, outpost, in, the, luapula, mweru, valley, the, british, boma, at, chiengi, in, 1891, the, western, shore, of, luapula, mweru, became, part, of, the, belgian, congo, and, the, eastern, shore, part, of, northern, rhodesia, a, british, protectorate, lake, mweru, to, tanganyika, is, an, area, which, was, exposed, to, european, influence, at, a, very, early, date, when, the, lakes, were, the, chief, entrance, to, northern, rhodesia, although, kilwa, island, is, closer, to, the, western, shore, it, was, allocated, to, northern, rhodesia, and, consequently, zambia, has, 58, of, the, lake, waters, and, dr, congo, 42, the, first, belgian, outposts, on, the, lake, were, set, up, at, lukonzolwa, and, pweto, which, were, at, various, times, the, headquarters, of, their, administration, of, katanga, they, stamped, out, the, slave, trade, going, north, east, around, the, lake, the, first, mission, station, on, the, lake, was, established, in, 1892, by, scottish, missionary, dan, crawford, of, the, plymouth, brethren, at, luanza, on, the, belgian, side, of, the, lake, the, british, moved, their, boma, from, chiengi, to, the, kalungwishi, with, one, or, two, british, officers, such, as, blair, watson, and, a, force, of, african, police, in, conjunction, with, operations, around, abercorn, further, down, the, trade, route, this, was, enough, to, end, the, slave, trade, going, east, from, mweru, but, not, enough, to, bring, mwata, kazembe, under, british, rule, and, a, military, expedition, had, to, be, sent, in, 1899, from, british, central, africa, nyasaland, to, do, that, job, see, the, article, on, alfred, sharpe, for, more, details, the, move, of, the, boma, from, chiengi, to, kalungwishi, had, the, effect, of, leaving, the, belgian, boma, at, pweto, a, free, rein, at, the, northern, end, of, the, lake, leading, a, hundred, years, later, to, about, 33, square, kilometres, 13, sq, mi, of, zambian, territory, next, to, pweto, being, ceded, to, the, dr, congo, then, zaire, see, the, luapula, province, border, dispute, for, further, details, and, references, after, 1900, the, belgian, congo, province, of, katanga, on, the, western, shores, of, the, lake, developed, faster, than, the, northern, rhodesian, side, the, luapula, province, and, the, town, of, kasenga, a, few, hours, by, boat, up, the, luapula, river, became, the, most, developed, in, the, luapula, mweru, valley, and, until, the, 1960s, was, the, main, commercial, centre, with, better, services, and, infrastructure, than, elsewhere, the, elizabethville, mines, started, up, more, quickly, than, those, of, the, copperbelt, and, kasenga, supplied, its, workforce, with, fish, since, 1960, political, crises, government, neglect, and, wars, on, the, congolese, side, have, produced, a, deterioration, in, infrastructure, while, peace, on, the, zambian, side, has, produced, an, increase, in, population, and, services, causing, the, balance, to, change, many, fishing, villages, dot, mweru, s, shores, a, number, are, seasonal, camps, the, main, towns, on, the, zambian, side, are, nchelenge, kashikishi, and, chiengi, and, on, the, dr, congo, side, kilwa, the, town, opposite, the, island, lukonzolwa, and, pweto, besides, kilwa, island, there, are, two, other, inhabited, islands, in, the, lake, zambia, s, isokwe, island, of, 3, square, kilometres, 1, 2, sq, mi, and, a, 2, square, kilometres, 0, 77, sq, mi, congolese, island, next, to, the, mouth, of, the, luapula, two, other, islands, in, the, luapula, swamps, have, shores, on, the, lake, the, congolese, side, of, the, lake, was, affected, by, the, second, congo, war, of, 1999, 2003, from, which, it, is, still, recovering, many, refugees, entered, zambia, at, pweto, and, were, accommodated, in, camps, in, mporokoso, and, kawambwa, districts, the, belgians, operated, a, regular, service, by, a, paddle, steamer, the, charles, lemaire, between, kasenga, on, the, luapula, and, pweto, at, the, outlet, of, the, luvua, river, a, distance, of, nearly, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, if, a, stop, at, kilwa, was, included, boats, still, ply, that, route, today, water, transport, is, less, used, on, the, zambian, side, except, to, kilwa, island, isokwe, island, and, chisenga, island, in, the, luapula, swamps, the, mweru, area, was, served, only, by, dirt, roads, until, the, main, luapula, province, road, on, the, zambian, side, was, tarred, to, nchelenge, in, 1987, the, population, around, the, lake, has, grown, much, of, it, exploiting, the, rich, fishery, of, the, lake, when, the, copperbelt, mines, shed, workers, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, many, ex, miners, relocated, to, the, lake, shores, particularly, around, nchelenge, kashikishi, the, dirt, roads, on, the, congolese, side, have, been, neglected, and, are, in, poor, condition, and, many, people, cross, into, zambia, to, travel, by, road, see, congo, pedicle, road, for, more, details, mweru, has, always, been, noted, for, its, longfin, tilapia, oreochromis, macrochir, called, pale, pa, lay, in, chibemba, which, traditionally, were, dried, on, racks, or, mats, in, the, sun, and, packed, in, baskets, for, market, smoking, and, salting, fish, are, more, recent, processes, in, the,

fishing, on, lake, mweru, and, the, luapula, river, was, pioneered, by, greek, fishermen, from, the, dodecanese, islands, who, settled, in, kasenga, dr, congo, on, the, western, bank, of, the, luapula, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, upriver, from, the, lake, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, they, used, boats, built, in, greek, style, powered, by, charcoal, fuelled, steam, engines, later, replaced, with, diesel, they, supplied, the, workforce, of, the, copper, mines, in, lubumbashi, later, the, whole, copperbelt, with, fish, which, was, packed, in, ice, at, kasenga, and, transported, from, there, in, trucks, it, was, estimated, in, 1950, there, were, 50, greek, boats, catching, 4, 000, short, tons, 3, 600, t, of, fresh, fish, per, year, it, would, take, a, week, for, a, boat, to, do, the, round, trip, to, the, lake, and, fill, its, hold, lined, with, ice, carried, on, board, in, recent, decades, the, catch, has, declined, due, to, over, fishing, and, is, estimated, at, 13, 000, long, tons, 13, 000, t, tonnes, caught, from, 4, 500, small, craft, mainly, plank, boats, congolese, fishermen, catch, the, most, despite, having, a, slightly, smaller, share, of, the, waters, the, tilapia, are, caught, by, gill, nets, and, do, not, reach, the, size, they, once, did, since, the, 1980s, chisense, fishing, increased, this, method, is, used, to, catch, small, pelagic, fish, called, kapenta, originally, from, beaches, but, now, using, lights, on, boats, at, night, to, attract, the, fish, which, are, then, scooped, up, in, fine, nets, the, dikulushi, copper, mine, is, an, open, cast, mine, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, north, of, kilwa, in, dr, congo, by, dirt, road, and, 23, kilometres, 14, mi, west, of, the, lake, the, mine, was, sold, by, anvil, mining, to,
