centuries, through, a, complex, process, of, acculturation, and, mixing, seen, elsewhere, in, the, maghreb, and, north, africa, some, of, the, indigenous, berber, tribes, mixed, with, the, maqil, arab, tribes, and, formed, a, culture, unique, to, morocco, and, mauritania, the, spanish, presence, in, the, region, of, modern, day, western, sahara, lasted, from, 1884, to, 1975, while, initial, spanish, interest, in, the, sahara, was, focused, on, using, it, as, a, port, for, the, slave, trade, by, the, 1700s, spain, had, transitioned, economic, activity, on, the, saharan, coast, towards, commercial, fishing, by, the, 19th, century, spain, had, claimed, the, southern, coastal, region, and, penetration, of, the, hinterland, gradually, followed, later, in, 1904, the, northern, region, was, acquired, after, an, agreement, among, the, european, colonial, powers, at, the, berlin, conference, in, 1884, on, the, division, of, spheres, of, influence, in, africa, the, same, year, spain, seized, control, of, western, sahara, and, established, it, as, a, spanish, colony, despite, establishing, their, first, colony, in, the, region, at, r, o, de, oro, bay, in, 1884, the, spanish, were, unable, to, pacify, the, interior, of, the, region, until, the, 1930s, raids, and, rebellions, by, the, indigenous, saharan, population, kept, the, spanish, forces, out, of, much, of, the, territory, for, a, long, time, the, territory, was, eventually, subdued, by, joint, spanish, and, french, forces, in, 1934, the, same, year, the, spaniards, divided, their, saharan, territories, into, two, regions, named, after, the, rivers, sagu, a, el, hamra, and, r, o, de, oro, after, 1939, and, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, this, area, was, administered, by, spanish, morocco, in, 1958, spain, joined, the, district, of, saguia, el, hamra, the, red, river, in, the, north, with, the, r, o, de, oro, in, the, south, to, form, the, province, of, spanish, sahara, following, morocco, s, claiming, these, regions, in, 1957, as, a, consequence, ahmed, belbachir, haskouri, the, chief, of, cabinet, general, secretary, of, the, government, of, spanish, morocco, cooperated, with, the, spanish, to, select, governors, in, that, area, the, saharan, lords, who, were, already, in, prominent, positions, such, as, the, members, of, maa, el, ainain, family, provided, a, recommended, list, of, candidates, for, new, governors, together, with, the, spanish, high, commissioner, belbachir, selected, from, this, list, during, the, annual, celebration, of, muhammad, s, birthday, these, lords, paid, their, respects, to, the, caliph, to, show, loyalty, to, the, moroccan, monarchy, as, time, went, by, spanish, colonial, rule, began, to, unravel, with, the, general, wave, of, decolonization, after, world, war, ii, former, north, african, and, sub, saharan, african, possessions, and, protectorates, gained, independence, from, european, powers, spanish, decolonization, proceeded, more, slowly, but, internal, political, and, social, pressures, for, it, in, mainland, spain, built, up, towards, the, end, of, francisco, franco, s, rule, there, was, a, global, trend, towards, complete, decolonization, spain, abandoned, most, territories, within, neighboring, morocco, in, 1956, but, resisted, encroachment, by, the, moroccan, liberation, army, within, ifni, and, spanish, sahara, from, 1956, to, 1958, in, 1971, sahrawi, an, arabic, term, for, those, from, sahara, students, in, moroccan, universities, began, organizing, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, embryonic, movement, for, the, liberation, of, sagu, a, el, hamra, and, r, o, de, oro, the, movement, tried, without, success, to, gain, backing, from, several, arab, governments, including, algeria, and, morocco, spain, began, rapidly, to, divest, itself, of, most, of, its, remaining, colonial, possessions, by, 1974, 75, the, government, issued, promises, of, a, referendum, on, independence, in, western, sahara, at, the, same, time, morocco, and, mauritania, which, had, historical, and, competing, claims, of, sovereignty, over, the, territory, argued, that, it, had, been, artificially, separated, from, their, territories, by, the, european, colonial, powers, algeria, which, also, bordered, the, territory, viewed, their, demands, with, suspicion, as, morocco, also, claimed, the, algerian, provinces, of, tindouf, and, b, char, after, arguing, for, a, process, of, decolonization, to, be, guided, by, the, united, nations, the, algerian, government, under, houari, boum, di, nne, in, 1975, committed, to, assisting, the, polisario, front, which, opposed, both, moroccan, and, mauritanian, claims, and, demanded, full, independence, of, western, sahara, the, un, attempted, to, settle, these, disputes, through, a, visiting, mission, in, late, 1975, as, well, as, a, verdict, from, the, international, court, of, justice, icj, it, acknowledged, that, western, sahara, had, historical, links, with, morocco, and, mauritania, but, not, sufficient, to, prove, the, sovereignty, of, either, state, over, the, territory, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, colonization, the, population, of, the, territory, thus, possessed, the, right, of, self, determination, on, 6, november, 1975, morocco, initiated, the, green, march, into, western, sahara, 350, 000, unarmed, moroccans, converged, on, the, city, of, tarfaya, in, southern, morocco, and, waited, for, a, signal, from, king, hassan, ii, of, morocco, to, cross, the, border, in, a, peaceful, march, a, few, days, before, on, 31, october, moroccan, troops, invaded, western, sahara, from, the, north, in, the, waning, days, of, general, franco, s, rule, and, after, the, green, march, the, spanish, government, signed, a, tripartite, agreement, with, morocco, and, mauritania, as, it, moved, to, transfer, the, territory, on, 14, november, 1975, the, accords, were, based, on, a, bipartite, administration, and, morocco, and, mauritania, each, moved, to, annex, the, territories, with, morocco, taking, control, of, the, northern, two, thirds, of, western, sahara, as, its, southern, provinces, and, mauritania, taking, control, of, the, southern, third, as, tiris, al, gharbiyya, spain, terminated, its, presence, in, spanish, sahara, within, three, months, repatriating, spanish, remains, from, its, cemeteries, the, moroccan, and, mauritanian, annexations, were, resisted, by, the, polisario, front, which, had, gained, backing, from, algeria, it, initiated, guerrilla, warfare, and, in, 1979, mauritania, withdrew, due, to, pressure, from, polisario, including, a, bombardment, of, its, capital, and, other, economic, targets, morocco, extended, its, control, to, the, rest, of, the, territory, it, gradually, contained, the, guerrillas, by, setting, up, the, extensive, sand, berm, in, the, desert, known, as, the, border, wall, or, moroccan, wall, to, exclude, guerrilla, fighters, hostilities, ceased, in, a, 1991, cease, fire, overseen, by, the, peacekeeping, mission, minurso, under, the, terms, of, a, un, settlement, plan, the, referendum, originally, scheduled, for, 1992, foresaw, giving, the, local, population, the, option, between, independence, or, affirming, integration, with, morocco, but, it, quickly, stalled, in, 1997, the, houston, agreement, attempted, to, revive, the, proposal, for, a, referendum, but, likewise, has, hitherto, not, had, success, as, of, 2010, negotiations, over, terms, have, not, resulted, in, any, substantive, action, at, the, heart, of, the, dispute, lies, the, question, of, who, qualifies, to, be, registered, to, participate, in, the, referendum, and, since, about, the, year, 2000, morocco, considers, that, since, there, is, no, agreement, on, persons, entitled, to, vote, a, referendum, is, not, possible, meanwhile, polisario, still, insisted, on, a, referendum, with, independence, as, a, clear, option, without, offering, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, who, is, qualified, to, be, registered, to, participate, in, it, both, sides, blame, each, other, for, the, stalling, of, the, referendum, the, polisario, has, insisted, on, only, allowing, those, found, on, the, 1974, spanish, census, lists, see, below, to, vote, while, morocco, has, insisted, that, the, census, was, flawed, by, evasion, and, sought, the, inclusion, of, members, of, sahrawi, tribes, that, escaped, from, spanish, invasion, to, the, north, of, morocco, by, the, 19th, century, efforts, by, the, un, special, envoys, to, find, a, common, ground, for, both, parties, did, not, succeed, by, 1999, the, un, had, identified, about, 85, 000, voters, with, nearly, half, of, them, in, the, moroccan, controlled, parts, of, western, sahara, or, southern, morocco, and, the, others, scattered, between, the, tindouf, refugee, camps, mauritania, and, other, places, of, exile, polisario, accepted, this, voter, list, as, it, had, done, with, the, previous, list, presented, by, the, un, both, of, them, originally, based, on, the, spanish, census, of, 1974, but, morocco, refused, and, as, rejected, voter, candidates, began, a, mass, appeals, procedure, insisted, that, each, application, be, scrutinized, individually, this, again, brought, the, process, to, a, halt, according, to, a, nato, delegation, minurso, election, observers, stated, in, 1999, as, the, deadlock, continued, that, if, the, number, of, voters, does, not, rise, significantly, the, odds, were, slightly, on, the, sadr, side, by, 2001, the, process, had, effectively, stalemated, and, the, un, secretary, general, asked, the, parties, for, the, first, time, to, explore, other, third, way, solutions, indeed, shortly, after, the, houston, agreement, 1997, morocco, officially, declared, that, it, was, no, longer, necessary, to, include, an, option, of, independence, on, the, ballot, offering, instead, autonomy, erik, jensen, who, played, an, administrative, role, in, minurso, wrote, that, neither, side, would, agree, to, a, voter, registration, in, which, they, were, destined, to, lose, see, western, sahara, anatomy, of, a, stalemate, as, personal, envoy, of, the, secretary, general, james, baker, visited, all, sides, and, produced, the, document, known, as, the, baker, plan, this, was, discussed, by, the, united, nations, security, council, in, 2000, and, envisioned, an, autonomous, western, sahara, authority, wsa, which, would, be, followed, after, five, years, by, the, referendum, every, person, present, in, the, territory, would, be, allowed, to, vote, regardless, of, birthplace, and, with, no, regard, to, the, spanish, census, it, was, rejected, by, both, sides, although, it, was, initially, derived, from, a, moroccan, proposal, according, to, baker, s, draft, tens, of, thousands, of, post, annexation, immigrants, from, morocco, proper, viewed, by, polisario, as, settlers, but, by, morocco, as, legitimate, inhabitants, of, the, area, would, be, granted, the, vote, in, the, sahrawi, independence, referendum, and, the, ballot, would, be, split, three, ways, by, the, inclusion, of, an, unspecified, autonomy, further, undermining, the, independence, camp, morocco, was, also, allowed, to, keep, its, army, in, the, area, and, retain, control, over, all, security, issues, during, both, the, autonomy, years, and, the, election, in, 2002, the, moroccan, king, stated, that, the, referendum, idea, was, out, of, date, since, it, cannot, be, implemented, polisario, retorted, that, that, was, only, because, of, the, king, s, refusal, to, allow, it, to, take, place, in, 2003, a, new, version, of, the, plan, was, made, official, with, some, additions, spelling, out, the, powers, of, the, wsa, making, it, less, reliant, on, moroccan, devolution, it, also, provided, further, detail, on, the, referendum, process, in, order, to, make, it, harder, to, stall, or, subvert, this, second, draft, commonly, known, as, baker, ii, was, accepted, by, the, polisario, as, a, basis, of, negotiations, to, the, surprise, of, many, this, appeared, to, abandon, polisario, s, previous, position, of, only, negotiating, based, on, the, standards, of, voter, identification, from, 1991, i, e, the, spanish, census, after, that, the, draft, quickly, garnered, widespread, international, support, culminating, in, the, un, security, council, s, unanimous, endorsement, of, the, plan, in, the, summer, of, 2003, baker, resigned, his, post, at, the, united, nations, in, 2004, his, term, did, not, see, the, crisis, resolved, his, resignation, followed, several, months, of, failed, attempts, to, get, morocco, to, enter, into, formal, negotiations, on, the, plan, but, he, was, met, with, rejection, king, hassan, ii, of, morocco, initially, supported, the, referendum, idea, in, principle, in, 1982, and, signed, contracts, with, polisario, and, the, un, in, 1991, and, 1997, no, major, powers, have, expressed, interest, in, forcing, the, issue, however, and, morocco, has, shown, little, interest, in, a, real, referendum, hassan, ii, s, son, and, successor, mohammed, vi, has, opposed, any, referendum, on, independence, and, has, said, morocco, will, never, agree, to, one, we, shall, not, give, up, one, inch, of, our, beloved, sahara, not, a, grain, of, its, sand, in, 2006, he, created, an, appointed, advisory, body, royal, advisory, council, for, saharan, affairs, corcas, which, proposes, a, self, governing, western, sahara, as, an, autonomous, community, within, morocco, the, un, has, put, forth, no, replacement, strategy, after, the, breakdown, of, baker, ii, and, renewed, fighting, has, been, raised, as, a, possibility, in, 2005, former, united, nations, secretary, general, kofi, annan, reported, increased, military, activity, on, both, sides, of, the, front, and, breaches, of, several, cease, fire, provisions, against, strengthening, military, fortifications, morocco, has, repeatedly, tried, to, engage, algeria, in, bilateral, negotiations, based, on, its, view, of, polisario, as, the, cat, s, paw, of, the, algerian, military, it, has, received, vocal, support, from, france, and, occasionally, and, currently, from, the, united, states, these, negotiations, would, define, the, exact, limits, of, a, western, sahara, autonomy, under, moroccan, rule, but, only, after, morocco, s, inalienable, right, to, the, territory, was, recognized, as, a, precondition, to, the, talks, the, algerian, government, has, consistently, refused, claiming, it, has, neither, the, will, nor, the, right, to, negotiate, on, the, behalf, of, the, polisario, front, in, may, 2005, demonstrations, and, riots, by, supporters, of, independence, or, a, referendum, broke, out, in, the, moroccan, controlled, parts, of, western, sahara, and, in, parts, of, southern, morocco, notably, the, town, of, assa, they, were, met, by, police, several, international, human, rights, organizations, expressed, concern, at, what, they, termed, abuse, by, moroccan, security, forces, and, a, number, of, sahrawi, activists, have, been, jailed, pro, independence, sahrawi, sources, including, the, polisario, have, given, these, demonstrations, the, name, independence, intifada, while, most, sources, have, tended, to, see, the, events, as, being, of, limited, importance, international, press, and, other, media, coverage, have, been, sparse, and, reporting, is, complicated, by, the, moroccan, government, s, policy, of, strictly, controlling, independent, media, coverage, within, the, territory, demonstrations, and, protests, still, occur, even, after, morocco, declared, in, february, 2006, that, it, was, contemplating, a, plan, for, devolving, a, limited, variant, of, autonomy, to, the, territory, but, still, explicitly, refused, any, referendum, on, independence, as, of, january, 2007, the, plan, had, not, been, made, public, though, the, moroccan, government, claimed, that, it, was, more, or, less, complete, polisario, has, intermittently, threatened, to, resume, fighting, referring, to, the, moroccan, refusal, of, a, referendum, as, a, breach, of, the, cease, fire, terms, but, most, observers, seem, to, consider, armed, conflict, unlikely, without, the, green, light, from, algeria, which, houses, the, sahrawis, refugee, camps, and, has, been, the, main, military, sponsor, of, the, movement, in, april, 2007, the, government, of, morocco, suggested, that, a, self, governing, entity, through, the, corcas, should, govern, the, territory, with, some, degree, of, autonomy, for, western, sahara, the, project, was, presented, to, the, un, security, council, in, mid, april, 2007, the, stalemating, of, the, moroccan, proposal, options, has, led, the, un, in, the, recent, report, of, the, un, secretary, general, to, ask, the, parties, to, enter, into, direct, and, unconditional, negotiations, to, reach, a, mutually, accepted, political, solution, in, october, 2010, gadaym, izik, camp, was, set, up, near, laayoune, as, a, protest, by, displaced, sahrawi, people, about, their, living, conditions, it, was, home, to, more, than, 12, 000, people, in, november, 2010, moroccan, security, forces, entered, gadaym, izik, camp, in, the, early, hours, of, the, morning, using, helicopters, and, water, cannon, to, force, people, to, leave, the,

the, mauritanian, controlled, part, roughly, corresponding, to, saquia, el, hamra, was, known, as, tiris, al, gharbiyya, aside, from, its, rich, fishing, waters, and, phosphate, reserves, western, sahara, has, few, natural, resources, and, lacks, sufficient, rainfall, and, freshwater, resources, for, most, agricultural, activities, western, sahara, s, much, touted, phosphate, reserves, are, relatively, unimportant, representing, less, than, two, percent, of, proven, phosphate, reserves, in, morocco, there, is, speculation, that, there, may, be, off, shore, oil, and, natural, gas, fields, but, the, debate, persists, as, to, whether, these, resources, can, be, profitably, exploited, and, if, this, would, be, legally, permitted, due, to, the, non, self, governing, status, of, western, sahara, see, below, western, sahara, s, economy, is, based, almost, entirely, on, fishing, which, employs, two, thirds, of, its, workforce, with, mining, agriculture, and, tourism, providing, modest, additional, income, most, food, for, the, urban, population, comes, from, morocco, all, trade, and, other, economic, activities, are, controlled, by, the, moroccan, government, as, its, de, facto, southern, province, the, government, has, encouraged, citizens, to, relocate, to, the, territory, by, giving, subsidies, and, price, controls, on, basic, goods, these, heavy, subsidies, have, created, a, state, dominated, economy, in, the, moroccan, controlled, parts, of, western, sahara, due, to, the, disputed, nature, of, moroccan, sovereignty, over, the, territory, the, application, of, international, accords, to, western, sahara, is, highly, ambiguous, political, leadership, of, trade, agreement, signatories, such, as, the, united, states, us, morocco, free, trade, agreement, and, norway, european, free, trade, association, trade, accord, have, made, statements, as, to, these, agreements, non, applicability, although, practical, policy, application, is, ambiguous, after, reasonably, exploitable, oil, fields, were, located, in, mauritania, speculation, intensified, on, the, possibility, of, major, oil, resources, being, located, off, the, coast, of, western, sahara, despite, the, fact, that, findings, remain, inconclusive, both, morocco, and, the, polisario, have, signed, deals, with, oil, and, gas, exploration, companies, us, and, french, companies, notably, totalenergies, and, kerr, mcgee, began, prospecting, on, behalf, of, the, moroccan, office, national, de, recherches, et, d, exploitations, petroli, res, onarep, in, 2002, hans, corell, under, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, and, head, of, its, office, of, legal, affairs, issued, a, legal, opinion, on, the, matter, the, opinion, was, rendered, following, an, analysis, of, relevant, provisions, of, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, the, united, nations, general, assembly, resolutions, the, case, law, of, the, international, court, of, justice, and, the, practice, of, sovereign, states, it, concluded, that, while, the, existing, exploration, contracts, for, the, area, were, not, illegal, if, further, exploration, and, exploitation, activities, were, to, proceed, in, disregard, of, the, interests, and, wishes, of, the, people, of, western, sahara, they, would, be, in, violation, of, the, principles, of, international, law, after, pressures, from, corporate, ethics, groups, totalenergies, pulled, out, in, late, 2004, in, may, 2006, the, remaining, company, kerr, mcgee, also, left, following, sales, of, numerous, shareholders, like, the, national, norwegian, oil, fund, due, to, continued, pressure, from, ngos, and, corporate, groups, in, december, 2014, it, became, known, that, seabird, exploration, operated, controversial, seismic, surveys, offshore, western, sahara, in, violation, of, the, 2002, hans, corell, legal, opinion, the, european, union, fishing, agreements, with, morocco, include, western, sahara, in, a, previously, confidential, legal, opinion, published, in, february, 2010, although, it, was, forwarded, in, july, 2009, the, european, parliament, s, legal, service, opined, that, fishing, by, european, vessels, under, a, current, eu, morocco, fishing, agreement, covering, western, sahara, s, waters, is, in, violation, of, international, law, similarly, the, exploitation, of, phosphate, mines, in, bou, craa, has, led, to, charges, of, international, law, violations, and, divestment, from, several, european, states, the, indigenous, population, of, western, sahara, is, usually, known, in, western, media, as, sahrawis, but, they, are, also, referred, to, in, morocco, as, southerners, or, southern, berbers, they, are, hassaniya, speaking, or, berber, speaking, tribes, of, berber, origin, 97, of, y, dna,

into, mauritania, and, north, into, morocco, as, well, as, east, into, algeria, the, sahrawis, are, traditionally, nomadic, bedouins, with, a, lifestyle, very, similar, to, that, of, the, tuareg, berbers, from, whom, sahrawis, most, likely, have, descended, and, they, can, be, found, in, all, surrounding, countries, war, and, conflict, has, led, to, major, population, displacement, as, of, july, 2004, an, estimated, 267, 405, people, excluding, about, 160, 000, moroccan, military, personnel, lived, in, the, moroccan, controlled, parts, of, western, sahara, many, people, from, parts, of, morocco, have, come, to, live, in, the, territory, and, these, latest, arrivals, are, today, thought, to, outnumber, the, indigenous, western, sahara, sahrawis, the, precise, size, and, composition, of, the, population, is, subject, to, political, controversy, the, polisario, controlled, parts, of, western, sahara, are, barren, this, area, has, a, sparse, population, estimated, to, be, approximately, 30, 000, in, 2008, the, population, is, primarily, made, up, of, nomads, who, engage, in, herding, camels, back, and, forth, between, the, tindouf, area, and, mauritania, the, presence, of, land, mines, scattered, throughout, the, territory, by, the, moroccan, army, makes, this, a, dangerous, way, of, life, a, 1974, spanish, census, claimed, there, were, some, 74, 000, sahrawis, in, the, area, at, the, time, in, addition, to, approximately, 20, 000, spanish, residents, but, this, number, is, likely, to, be, on, the, low, side, due, to, the, difficulty, in, counting, a, nomad, people, even, if, sahrawis, were, by, the, mid, 1970s, mostly, urbanized, despite, these, possible, inaccuracies, morocco, and, the, polisario, front, agreed, on, using, the, spanish, census, as, the, basis, for, voter, registration, when, striking, a, cease, fire, agreement, in, the, late, 1980s, contingent, on, the, holding, of, a, referendum, on, independence, or, integration, into, morocco, in, december, 1999, the, united, nations, minurso, mission, announced, that, it, had, identified, 86, 425, eligible, voters, for, the, referendum, that, was, supposed, to, be, held, under, the, 1991, settlement, plan, and, the, 1997, houston, accords, by, eligible, voter, the, un, referred, to, any, sahrawi, over, 18, years, of, age, that, was, part, of, the, spanish, census, or, could, prove, their, descent, from, someone, who, was, these, 86, 425, sahrawis, were, dispersed, between, moroccan, controlled, western, sahara, and, the, refugee, camps, in, algeria, with, smaller, numbers, in, mauritania, and, other, places, of, exile, these, numbers, cover, only, sahrawis, indigenous, to, western, sahara, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, not, the, total, number, of, ethnic, sahrawis, i, e, members, of, sahrawi, tribal, groupings, who, also, extend, into, mauritania, morocco, and, algeria, the, number, was, highly, politically, significant, due, to, the, expected, organization, of, a, referendum, on, self, determination, the, polisario, has, its, home, base, in, the, tindouf, refugee, camps, in, algeria, and, declares, the, number, of, sahrawi, population, in, the, camps, to, be, approximately, 155, 000, morocco, disputes, this, number, saying, it, is, exaggerated, for, political, reasons, and, for, attracting, more, foreign, aid, the, un, uses, a, number, of, 90, 000, most, vulnerable, refugees, as, basis, for, its, food, aid, program, the, major, ethnic, group, of, western, sahara, are, the, sahrawis, a, nomadic, or, bedouin, ethnic, group, speaking, the, hass, n, ya, dialect, of, arabic, also, spoken, in, much, of, mauritania, they, are, of, mixed, arab, berber, descent, but, claim, descent, from, the, beni, hassan, an, arab, tribe, that,

roughly, from, 1884, to, 1976, following, the, creation, of, the, madrid, accords, where, spain, absolved, all, responsibility, over, the, territory, and, left, it, to, morocco, and, mauritania, throughout, the, nine, decades, of, spanish, colonial, presence, one, of, the, primary, spoken, languages, in, western, sahara, came, to, be, spanish, the, reasons, for, its, widespread, usage, was, due, to, the, necessity, of, communicating, with, spanish, leadership, and, administrators, throughout, the, territory, who, ultimately, established, institutions, modeled, after, those, of, spain, the, importance, and, prevalence, of, spanish, has, persisted, to, the, present, day, even, after, spanish, withdrawal, from, western, sahara, in, 1976, due, to, various, education, exchanges, and, host, programs, for, sahrawi, children, to, spain, and, cuba, one, such, exchange, program, to, spain, is, vacaciones, en, paz, vacations, in, peace, which, is, an, annual, holiday, program, that, was, created, in, 1988, and, is, organized, by, the, union, of, sahrawi, youth, ujsario, in, collaboration, with, 300, other, associations, throughout, spain, the, program, itself, allows, 7, 000, to,
