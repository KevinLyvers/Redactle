urban, planning, also, known, as, town, planning, city, planning, regional, planning, or, rural, planning, in, specific, contexts, is, a, technical, and, political, process, that, is, focused, on, the, development, and, design, of, land, use, and, the, built, environment, including, air, water, and, the, infrastructure, passing, into, and, out, of, urban, areas, such, as, transportation, communications, and, distribution, networks, and, their, accessibility, traditionally, urban, planning, followed, a, top, down, approach, in, master, planning, the, physical, layout, of, human, settlements, the, primary, concern, was, the, public, welfare, which, included, considerations, of, efficiency, sanitation, protection, and, use, of, the, environment, as, well, as, effects, of, the, master, plans, on, the, social, and, economic, activities, over, time, urban, planning, has, adopted, a, focus, on, the, social, and, environmental, bottom, lines, that, focus, on, planning, as, a, tool, to, improve, the, health, and, well, being, of, people, maintaining, sustainability, standards, similarly, in, the, early, 21st, century, jane, jacobs, s, writings, on, legal, and, political, perspectives, to, emphasize, the, interests, of, residents, businesses, and, communities, effectively, influenced, urban, planners, to, take, into, broader, consideration, of, resident, experiences, and, needs, while, planning, urban, planning, answers, questions, about, how, people, will, live, work, and, play, in, a, given, area, and, thus, guides, orderly, development, in, urban, suburban, and, rural, areas, although, predominantly, concerned, with, the, planning, of, settlements, and, communities, urban, planners, are, also, responsible, for, planning, the, efficient, transportation, of, goods, resources, people, and, waste, the, distribution, of, basic, necessities, such, as, water, and, electricity, a, sense, of, inclusion, and, opportunity, for, people, of, all, kinds, culture, and, needs, economic, growth, or, business, development, improving, health, and, conserving, areas, of, natural, environmental, significance, that, actively, contributes, to, reduction, in, co, 2, emissions, as, well, as, protecting, heritage, structures, and, built, environments, since, most, urban, planning, teams, consist, of, highly, educated, individuals, that, work, for, city, governments, recent, debates, focus, on, how, to, involve, more, community, members, in, city, planning, processes, urban, planning, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, includes, civil, engineering, architecture, human, geography, politics, social, science, and, design, sciences, practitioners, of, urban, planning, are, concerned, with, research, and, analysis, strategic, thinking, engineering, architecture, urban, design, public, consultation, policy, recommendations, implementation, and, management, it, is, closely, related, to, the, field, of, urban, design, and, some, urban, planners, provide, designs, for, streets, parks, buildings, and, other, urban, areas, urban, planners, work, with, the, cognate, fields, of, civil, engineering, landscape, architecture, architecture, and, public, administration, to, achieve, strategic, policy, and, sustainability, goals, early, urban, planners, were, often, members, of, these, cognate, fields, though, today, urban, planning, is, a, separate, independent, professional, discipline, the, discipline, of, urban, planning, is, the, broader, category, that, includes, different, sub, fields, such, as, land, use, planning, zoning, economic, development, environmental, planning, and, transportation, planning, creating, the, plans, requires, a, thorough, understanding, of, penal, codes, and, zonal, codes, of, planning, another, important, aspect, of, urban, planning, is, that, the, range, of, urban, planning, projects, include, the, large, scale, master, planning, of, empty, sites, or, greenfield, projects, as, well, as, small, scale, interventions, and, refurbishments, of, existing, structures, buildings, and, public, spaces, pierre, charles, l, enfant, in, washington, d, c, daniel, burnham, in, chicago, l, cio, costa, in, bras, lia, and, georges, eugene, haussmann, in, paris, planned, cities, from, scratch, and, robert, moses, and, le, corbusier, refurbished, and, transformed, cities, and, neighborhoods, to, meet, their, ideas, of, urban, planning, there, is, evidence, of, urban, planning, and, designed, communities, dating, back, to, the, mesopotamian, indus, valley, minoan, and, egyptian, civilizations, in, the, third, millennium, bce, archaeologists, studying, the, ruins, of, cities, in, these, areas, find, paved, streets, that, were, laid, out, at, right, angles, in, a, grid, pattern, the, idea, of, a, planned, out, urban, area, evolved, as, different, civilizations, adopted, it, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, bce, greek, city, states, primarily, used, orthogonal, or, grid, like, plans, hippodamus, of, miletus, 498, 408, bc, the, ancient, greek, architect, and, urban, planner, is, considered, to, be, the, father, of, european, urban, planning, and, the, namesake, of, the, hippodamian, plan, grid, plan, of, city, layout, the, ancient, romans, also, used, orthogonal, plans, for, their, cities, city, planning, in, the, roman, world, was, developed, for, military, defense, and, public, convenience, the, spread, of, the, roman, empire, subsequently, spread, the, ideas, of, urban, planning, as, the, roman, empire, declined, these, ideas, slowly, disappeared, however, many, cities, in, europe, still, held, onto, the, planned, roman, city, center, cities, in, europe, from, the, 9th, to, 14th, centuries, often, grew, organically, and, sometimes, chaotically, but, in, the, following, centuries, with, the, coming, of, the, renaissance, many, new, cities, were, enlarged, with, newly, planned, extensions, from, the, 15th, century, on, much, more, is, recorded, of, urban, design, and, the, people, that, were, involved, in, this, period, theoretical, treatises, on, architecture, and, urban, planning, start, to, appear, in, which, theoretical, questions, around, planning, the, main, lines, ensuring, plans, meet, the, needs, of, the, given, population, and, so, forth, are, addressed, and, designs, of, towns, and, cities, are, described, and, depicted, during, the, enlightenment, period, several, european, rulers, ambitiously, attempted, to, redesign, capital, cities, during, the, second, french, empire, baron, georges, eug, ne, haussmann, under, the, direction, of, napoleon, iii, redesigned, the, city, of, paris, into, a, more, modern, capital, with, long, straight, wide, boulevards, planning, and, architecture, went, through, a, paradigm, shift, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, industrialized, cities, of, the, 19th, century, grew, at, a, tremendous, rate, the, evils, of, urban, life, for, the, working, poor, were, becoming, increasingly, evident, as, a, matter, of, public, concern, the, laissez, faire, style, of, government, management, of, the, economy, in, fashion, for, most, of, the, victorian, era, was, starting, to, give, way, to, a, new, liberalism, that, championed, intervention, on, the, part, of, the, poor, and, disadvantaged, around, 1900, theorists, began, developing, urban, planning, models, to, mitigate, the, consequences, of, the, industrial, age, by, providing, citizens, especially, factory, workers, with, healthier, environments, the, following, century, would, therefore, be, globally, dominated, by, a, central, planning, approach, to, urban, planning, not, representing, an, increment, in, the, overall, quality, of, the, urban, realm, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, urban, planning, began, to, be, recognized, as, a, separate, profession, the, town, and, country, planning, association, was, founded, in, 1899, and, the, first, academic, course, in, great, britain, on, urban, planning, was, offered, by, the, university, of, liverpool, in, 1909, in, the, 1920s, the, ideas, of, modernism, and, uniformity, began, to, surface, in, urban, planning, and, lasted, until, the, 1970s, in, 1933, le, corbusier, presented, the, radiant, city, a, city, that, grows, up, in, the, form, of, towers, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, pollution, and, over, crowding, but, many, planners, started, to, believe, that, the, ideas, of, modernism, in, urban, planning, led, to, higher, crime, rates, and, social, problems, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, urban, planners, gradually, shifted, their, focus, to, individualism, and, diversity, in, urban, centers, urban, planners, studying, the, effects, of, increasing, congestion, in, urban, areas, began, to, address, the, externalities, the, negative, impacts, caused, by, induced, demand, from, larger, highway, systems, in, western, countries, such, as, in, the, united, states, the, united, nations, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, predicted, in, 2018, that, around, 2, 5, billion, more, people, occupy, urban, areas, by, 2050, according, to, population, elements, of, global, migration, new, planning, theories, have, adopted, non, traditional, concepts, such, as, blue, zones, and, innovation, districts, to, incorporate, geographic, areas, within, the, city, that, allow, for, novel, business, development, and, the, prioritization, of, infrastructure, that, would, assist, with, improving, the, quality, of, life, of, citizens, by, extending, their, potential, lifespan, planning, practices, have, incorporated, policy, changes, to, help, address, anthropogenic, human, caused, climate, change, london, began, to, charge, a, congestion, charge, for, cars, trying, to, access, already, crowded, places, in, the, city, cities, nowadays, stress, the, importance, of, public, transit, and, cycling, by, adopting, such, policies, planning, theory, is, the, body, of, scientific, concepts, definitions, behavioral, relationships, and, assumptions, that, define, the, body, of, knowledge, of, urban, planning, there, are, eight, procedural, theories, of, planning, that, remain, the, principal, theories, of, planning, procedure, today, the, rational, comprehensive, approach, the, incremental, approach, the, transactive, approach, the, communicative, approach, the, advocacy, approach, the, equity, approach, the, radical, approach, and, the, humanist, or, phenomenological, approach, some, other, conceptual, planning, theories, include, ebenezer, howard, s, the, three, magnets, theory, that, he, envisioned, for, the, future, of, british, settlement, also, his, garden, cities, the, concentric, model, zone, also, called, the, burgess, model, by, sociologist, ernest, burgess, the, radburn, superblock, that, encourages, pedestrian, movement, the, sector, model, and, the, multiple, nuclei, model, among, others, participatory, planning, is, an, urban, planning, approach, that, involves, the, entire, community, in, the, planning, process, participatory, planning, in, the, united, states, emerged, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, technical, aspects, of, urban, planning, involve, the, application, of, scientific, technical, processes, considerations, and, features, that, are, involved, in, planning, for, land, use, urban, design, natural, resources, transportation, and, infrastructure, urban, planning, includes, techniques, such, as, predicting, population, growth, zoning, geographic, mapping, and, analysis, analyzing, park, space, surveying, the, water, supply, identifying, transportation, patterns, recognizing, food, supply, demands, allocating, healthcare, and, social, services, and, analyzing, the, impact, of, land, use, in, order, to, predict, how, cities, will, develop, and, estimate, the, effects, of, their, interventions, planners, use, various, models, these, models, can, be, used, to, indicate, relationships, and, patterns, in, demographic, geographic, and, economic, data, they, might, deal, with, short, term, issues, such, as, how, people, move, through, cities, or, long, term, issues, such, as, land, use, and, growth, one, such, model, is, the, geographic, information, system, gis, that, is, used, to, create, a, model, of, the, existing, planning, and, then, to, project, future, impacts, on, the, society, economy, and, environment, building, codes, and, other, regulations, dovetail, with, urban, planning, by, governing, how, cities, are, constructed, and, used, from, the, individual, level, enforcement, methodologies, include, governmental, zoning, planning, permissions, and, building, codes, as, well, as, private, easements, and, restrictive, covenants, with, recent, advances, in, information, and, communication, technologies, and, the, internet, of, things, an, increasing, number, of, cities, are, adopting, technologies, such, as, crowdsorced, mobile, phone, sensing, and, machine, learning, to, collect, data, and, extract, useful, information, to, help, make, informed, urban, planning, decisions, an, urban, planner, is, a, professional, who, works, in, the, field, of, urban, planning, for, the, purpose, of, optimizing, the, effectiveness, of, a, community, s, land, use, and, infrastructure, they, formulate, plans, for, the, development, and, management, of, urban, and, suburban, areas, they, typically, analyze, land, use, compatibility, as, well, as, economic, environmental, and, social, trends, in, developing, any, plan, for, a, community, whether, commercial, residential, agricultural, natural, or, recreational, urban, planners, must, consider, a, wide, array, of, issues, including, sustainability, existing, and, potential, pollution, transport, including, potential, congestion, crime, land, values, economic, development, social, equity, zoning, codes, and, other, legislation, the, importance, of, the, urban, planner, is, increasing, in, the, 21st, century, as, modern, society, begins, to, face, issues, of, increased, population, growth, climate, change, and, unsustainable, development, an, urban, planner, could, be, considered, a, green, collar, professional, some, researchers, suggest, that, urban, planners, globally, work, in, different, planning, cultures, adapted, to, their, cities, and, cultures, however, professionals, have, identified, skills, abilities, and, basic, knowledge, sets, that, are, common, to, urban, planners, across, regional, and, national, boundaries, the, school, of, neoclassical, economics, argues, that, planning, is, unnecessary, or, even, harmful, as, it, market, efficiency, allows, for, effective, land, use, a, pluralist, strain, of, political, thinking, argues, in, a, similar, vein, that, the, government, should, not, intrude, in, the, political, competition, between, different, interest, groups, which, decides, how, land, is, used, the, traditional, justification, for, urban, planning, has, in, response, been, that, the, planner, does, to, the, city, what, the, engineer, or, architect, does, to, the, home, that, is, make, it, more, amenable, to, the, needs, and, preferences, of, its, inhabitants, the, widely, adopted, consensus, building, model, of, planning, which, seeks, to, accommodate, different, preferences, within, the, community, has, been, criticized, for, being, based, upon, rather, than, challenging, the, power, structures, of, the, community, instead, agonism, has, been, proposed, as, a, framework, for, urban, planning, decision, making, another, debate, within, the, urban, planning, field, is, about, who, is, included, and, excluded, in, the, urban, planning, decision, making, process, most, urban, planning, processes, use, a, top, down, approach, which, fails, to, include, the, residents, of, the, places, where, urban, planners, and, city, officials, are, working, sherry, arnstein, s, ladder, of, citizen, participation, is, often, used, by, many, urban, planners, and, city, governments, to, determine, the, degree, of, inclusivity, or, exclusivity, of, their, urban, planning, one, main, source, of, engagement, between, city, officials, and, residents, are, city, council, meetings, that, are, open, to, the, residents, and, that, welcome, public, comments, additionally, in, usa, there, are, some, federal, requirements, for, citizen, participation, in, government, funded, infrastructure, projects, participatory, urban, planning, has, been, criticized, for, contributing, to, the, housing, crisis, in, parts, of, the, world
