perceived, the, region, s, changing, circumstances, with, both, a, sense, of, fear, and, opportunity, they, were, afraid, because, of, the, prospect, that, slaves, might, revolt, in, cuba, as, well, and, numerous, prohibitions, during, the, 1790s, of, the, sale, of, slaves, in, cuba, who, had, previously, been, enslaved, in, french, colonies, underscored, this, anxiety, the, planters, saw, opportunity, however, because, they, thought, that, they, could, exploit, the, situation, by, transforming, cuba, into, the, slave, society, and, sugar, producing, pearl, of, the, antilles, that, haiti, had, been, before, the, revolution, as, the, historian, ada, ferrer, has, written, at, a, basic, level, liberation, in, saint, domingue, helped, entrench, its, denial, in, cuba, as, slavery, and, colonialism, collapsed, in, the, french, colony, the, spanish, island, underwent, transformations, that, were, almost, the, mirror, image, of, haiti, s, estimates, suggest, that, between, 1790, and, 1820, some, 325, 000, africans, were, imported, to, cuba, as, slaves, which, was, four, times, the, amount, that, had, arrived, between, 1760, and, 1790, although, a, smaller, proportion, of, the, population, of, cuba, was, enslaved, at, times, slaves, arose, in, revolt, in, 1812, the, aponte, slave, rebellion, took, place, but, it, was, ultimately, suppressed, the, population, of, cuba,

urbanized, settings, by, the, 19th, century, the, practice, of, coartacion, had, developed, or, buying, oneself, out, of, slavery, a, uniquely, cuban, development, according, to, historian, herbert, s, klein, due, to, a, shortage, of, white, labor, blacks, dominated, urban, industries, to, such, an, extent, that, when, whites, in, large, numbers, came, to, cuba, in, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, they, were, unable, to, displace, negro, workers, a, system, of, diversified, agriculture, with, small, farms, and, fewer, slaves, served, to, supply, the, cities, with, produce, and, other, goods, in, the, 1820s, when, the, rest, of, spain, s, empire, in, latin, america, rebelled, and, formed, independent, states, cuba, remained, loyal, to, spain, its, economy, was, based, on, serving, the, empire, by, 1860, cuba, had, 213, 167, free, people, of, color, 39, of, its, non, white, population, of, 550, 000, full, independence, from, spain, was, the, goal, of, a, rebellion, in, 1868, led, by, planter, carlos, manuel, de, c, spedes, de, c, spedes, a, sugar, planter, freed, his, slaves, to, fight, with, him, for, an, independent, cuba, on, 27, december, 1868, he, issued, a, decree, condemning, slavery, in, theory, but, accepting, it, in, practice, and, declaring, free, any, slaves, whose, masters, present, them, for, military, service, the, 1868, rebellion, resulted, in, a, prolonged, conflict, known, as, the, ten, years, war, a, great, number, of, the, rebels, were, volunteers, from, the, dominican, republic, and, other, countries, as, well, as, numerous, chinese, indentured, servants, the, united, states, declined, to, recognize, the, new, cuban, government, although, many, european, and, latin, american, nations, did, so, in, 1878, the, pact, of,

new, beginning, with, cuba, and, reversed, the, bush, administration, s, prohibition, on, travel, and, remittances, by, cuban, americans, from, the, united, states, to, cuba, five, years, later, an, agreement, between, the, united, states, and, cuba, popularly, called, the, cuban, thaw, brokered, in, part, by, canada, and, pope, francis, began, the, process, of, restoring, international, relations, between, the, two, countries, they, agreed, to, release, political, prisoners, and, the, united, states, began, the, process, of, creating, an, embassy, in, havana, this, was, realized, on,

speaking, out, against, u, s, sanctions, against, russia, and, cuba, since, 1960, the, u, s, embargo, on, cuba, stands, as, one, of, the, longest, running, trade, and, economic, measures, in, bilateral, relations, history, having, endured, for, almost, six, decades, this, action, was, initiated, in, response, to, a, wave, of, nationalizations, that, impacted, american, properties, valued, at, over, us, 1, billion, the, then, u, s, president, dwight, eisenhower, instated, an, embargo, that, prohibited, all, exports, to, cuba, with, the, exception, of, medicines, and, certain, foods, this, measure, was, intensified, in, 1962, under, the, administration, of, john, f, kennedy, extending, the, restrictions, to, cuban, imports, based, on, the, foreign, assistance, act, approved, by, congress, in, 1961, during, the, missile, crisis, in, 1962, the, united, states, even, imposed, a, naval, blockade, on, cuba, but, this, was, lifted, following, the, resolution, of, the, crisis, the,

it, continues, to, refuse, to, move, toward, democratization, and, greater, respect, for, human, rights, american, diplomat, lester, d, mallory, wrote, an, internal, memo, on, april, 6, 1960, arguing, in, favor, of, an, embargo, the, only, foreseeable, means, of, alienating, internal, support, is, through, disenchantment, and, disaffection, based, on, economic, dissatisfaction, and, hardship, to, decrease, monetary, and, real, wages, to, bring, about, hunger, desperation, and, overthrow, of, government, the, un, general, assembly, has, passed, a, resolution, every, year, since, 1992,

and, effectiveness, of, the, embargo, have, been, subjects, of, intense, debate, while, some, argue, it, has, been, extraordinarily, porous, and, isn, t, the, primary, cause, of, cuba, s, economic, hardships, others, see, it, as, a, pressure, mechanism, aimed, at, driving, change, in, the, cuban, government, according, to, arturo, lopez, levy, a, professor, of, international, relations, it, would, be, more, appropriate, to, refer, to, the, measure, as, a, blockade, or, siege, as, it, goes, beyond, mere, trade, restrictions, other, critics, of, the, cuban, government, argue, that, the, embargo, has, been, used, by, the, government, as, an, excuse, to, justify, its, own, economic, and, political, shortcomings, on, 17, december, 2014, united, states, president, barack, obama, announced, the, re, establishment, of, diplomatic, relations, with, cuba, pushing, for, congress, to, put, an, end, to, the, embargo, as, well, as, the, united, states, run, guantanamo, bay,
