sea, before, being, toppled, from, the, throne, for, supporting, fyodor, koriatovych, in, his, conflict, with, vytautas, the, great, of, lithuania, under, stephen, i, although, alexander, i, was, brought, to, the, throne, in, 1400, by, the, hungarians, with, assistance, from, mircea, i, of, wallachia, he, shifted, his, allegiances, towards, poland, notably, engaging, moldavian, forces, on, the, polish, side, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, and, the, siege, of, marienburg, and, placed, his, own, choice, of, rulers, in, wallachia, his, reign, was, one, of, the, most, successful, in, moldavia, s, history, but, also, saw, the, first, confrontation, with, the, ottoman, turks, at, cetatea, alb, in, 1420, and, later, even, a, conflict, with, the, poles, a, deep, crisis, was, to, follow, alexandru, s, long, reign, with, his, successors, battling, each, other, in, a, succession, of, wars, that, divided, the, country, until, the, murder, of, bogdan, ii, and, the, ascension, of, petru, iii, aron, in, 1451, nevertheless, moldavia, was, subject, to, further, hungarian, interventions, after, that, moment, as, matthias, corvinus, deposed, aron, and, backed, alex, ndrel, to, the, throne, in, suceava, petru, aron, s, rule, also, signified, the, beginning, of, moldavia, s, ottoman, empire, allegiance, as, the, ruler, agreed, to, pay, tribute, to, sultan, mehmed, ii, under, stephen, the, great, who, took, the, throne, and, subsequently, came, to, an, agreement, with, casimir, iv, of, poland, in, 1457, the, state, reached, its, most, glorious, period, stephen, blocked, hungarian, interventions, in, the, battle, of, baia, invaded, wallachia, in, 1471, and, dealt, with, ottoman, reprisals, in, a, major, victory, the, 1475, battle, of, vaslui, after, feeling, threatened, by, polish, ambitions, he, also, attacked, galicia, and, resisted, a, polish, invasion, in, the, battle, of, the, cosmin, forest, 1497, however, he, had, to, surrender, chilia, now, kiliia, and, cetatea, alb, now, bilhorod, dnistrovskyi, the, two, main, fortresses, in, the, budjak, to, the, ottomans, in, 1484, and, in, 1498, he, had, to, accept, ottoman, suzerainty, when, he, was, forced, to, agree, to, continue, paying, tribute, to, sultan, bayezid, ii, following, the, taking, of, hotin, khotyn, and, pokuttya, stephen, s, rule, also, brought, a, brief, extension, of, moldavian, rule, into, transylvania, cetatea, de, balt, and, ciceu, became, his, fiefs, in, 1489, under, bogdan, iii, the, one, eyed, ottoman, overlordship, was, confirmed, in, the, shape, that, would, rapidly, evolve, into, control, over, moldavia, s, affairs, peter, iv, rare, who, reigned, in, the, 1530s, and, 1540s, clashed, with, the, habsburg, monarchy, over, his, ambitions, in, transylvania, losing, possessions, in, the, region, to, george, martinuzzi, was, defeated, in, pokuttya, by, poland, and, failed, in, his, attempt, to, extricate, moldavia, from, ottoman, rule, the, country, lost, bender, to, the, ottomans, who, included, it, in, their, silistra, eyalet, a, period, of, profound, crisis, followed, moldavia, stopped, issuing, its, own, coinage, c, 1520, under, prince, tef, ni, when, it, was, confronted, with, rapid, depletion, of, funds, and, rising, demands, from, the, porte, such, problems, became, endemic, when, the, country, brought, into, the, great, turkish, war, suffered, the, impact, of, the, stagnation, of, the, ottoman, empire, at, one, point, during, the, 1650s, and, 1660s, princes, began, relying, on, counterfeit, coinage, usually, copies, of, swedish, riksdalers, as, was, that, issued, by, eustratie, dabija, the, economic, decline, was, accompanied, by, a, failure, to, maintain, state, structures, the, feudal, based, moldavian, military, forces, were, no, longer, convoked, and, the, few, troops, maintained, by, the, rulers, remained, professional, mercenaries, such, as, the, seimeni, however, moldavia, and, the, similarly, affected, wallachia, remained, both, important, sources, of, income, for, the, ottoman, empire, and, relatively, prosperous, agricultural, economies, especially, as, suppliers, of, grain, and, cattle, the, latter, was, especially, relevant, in, moldavia, which, remained, an, under, populated, country, of, pastures, in, time, much, of, the, resources, were, tied, to, the, ottoman, economy, either, through, monopolies, on, trade, that, were, only, lifted, in, 1829, after, the, treaty, of, adrianople, which, did, not, affect, all, domains, directly, or, through, the, raise, in, direct, taxes, the, one, demanded, by, the, ottomans, from, the, princes, as, well, as, the, ones, demanded, by, the, princes, from, the, country, s, population, taxes, were, directly, proportional, with, ottoman, requests, but, also, with, the, growing, importance, of, ottoman, appointment, and, sanctioning, of, princes, in, front, of, election, by, the, boyars, and, the, boyar, council, sfatul, boieresc, drawing, in, a, competition, among, pretenders, which, also, implied, the, intervention, of, creditors, as, suppliers, of, bribes, the, fiscal, system, soon, included, taxes, such, as, the, v, c, rit, a, tax, on, head, of, cattle, first, introduced, by, iancu, sasul, in, the, 1580s, the, economic, opportunities, offered, brought, about, a, significant, influx, of, greek, and, levantine, financiers, and, officials, who, entered, a, stiff, competition, with, the, high, boyars, over, appointments, to, the, court, as, the, manor, system, suffered, the, blows, of, economic, crises, and, in, the, absence, of, salarisation, which, implied, that, persons, in, office, could, decide, their, own, income, obtaining, princely, appointment, became, the, major, focus, of, a, boyar, s, career, such, changes, also, implied, the, decline, of, free, peasantry, and, the, rise, of, serfdom, as, well, as, the, rapid, fall, in, the, importance, of, low, boyars, a, traditional, institution, the, latter, soon, became, marginal, and, in, more, successful, instances, added, to, the, population, of, towns, however, they, also, implied, a, rapid, transition, towards, a, monetary, economy, based, on, exchanges, in, foreign, currency, serfdom, was, doubled, by, the, much, less, numerous, slave, population, robi, composed, of, migrant, roma, and, captured, nogais, the, conflict, between, princes, and, boyars, was, to, become, exceptionally, violent, the, latter, group, who, frequently, appealed, to, the, ottoman, court, in, order, to, have, princes, comply, with, its, demands, was, persecuted, by, rulers, such, as, alexandru, l, pu, neanu, and, john, iii, ioan, vod, s, revolt, against, the, ottomans, ended, in, his, execution, 1574, the, country, descended, into, political, chaos, with, frequent, ottoman, and, tatar, incursions, and, pillages, the, claims, of, mu, atins, to, the, crown, and, the, traditional, system, of, succession, were, ended, by, scores, of, illegitimate, reigns, one, of, the, usurpers, ioan, iacob, heraclid, was, a, protestant, greek, who, encouraged, the, renaissance, and, attempted, to, introduce, lutheranism, to, moldavia, in, 1595, the, rise, of, the, movile, ti, boyars, to, the, throne, with, ieremia, movil, coincided, with, the, start, of, frequent, anti, ottoman, and, anti, habsburg, military, expeditions, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, into, moldavian, territory, see, moldavian, magnate, wars, and, rivalries, between, pretenders, to, the, moldavian, throne, encouraged, by, the, three, competing, powers, the, wallachian, prince, michael, the, brave, after, previously, taking, over, transylvania, also, deposed, prince, ieremia, movil, in, 1600, and, managed, to, become, the, first, prince, to, rule, over, moldavia, wallachia, and, transylvania, the, episode, ended, in, polish, conquests, of, lands, down, to, bucharest, soon, ended, by, the, outbreak, of, the, polish, swedish, war, and, the, reestablishment, of, ottoman, rule, polish, incursions, were, dealt, a, blow, by, the, ottomans, during, the, 1620, battle, of, cecora, which, also, saw, an, end, to, the, reign, of, gaspar, graziani, a, period, of, relative, peace, followed, during, the, more, prosperous, and, prestigious, rule, of, vasile, lupu, he, took, the, throne, as, a, boyar, appointee, in, 1637, and, began, battling, his, rival, gheorghe, tefan, as, well, as, the, wallachian, prince, matei, basarab, however, his, invasion, of, wallachia, with, the, backing, of, cossack, hetman, bohdan, khmelnytsky, ended, in, disaster, at, the, battle, of, finta, in, 1653, a, few, years, later, moldavia, was, occupied, for, two, short, intervals, by, the, anti, ottoman, wallachian, prince, constantin, erban, who, clashed, with, the, first, ruler, of, the, ghica, family, george, ghica, in, the, early, 1680s, moldavian, troops, under, george, ducas, intervened, in, right, bank, ukraine, and, assisted, mehmed, iv, in, the, battle, of, vienna, only, to, suffer, the, effects, of, the, great, turkish, war, during, the, late, 17th, century, moldavia, became, the, target, of, the, russian, empire, s, southwards, expansion, inaugurated, by, peter, the, great, with, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1710, 1711, prince, dimitrie, cantemir, sided, with, peter, in, open, rebellion, against, the, ottomans, but, he, was, defeated, at, st, nile, ti, sultan, ahmed, iii, officially, discarded, recognition, of, local, choices, for, princes, imposing, instead, a, system, relying, solely, on, ottoman, approval, the, phanariote, epoch, inaugurated, by, the, reign, of, nicholas, mavrocordatos, phanariote, rule, was, marked, by, political, corruption, intrigue, and, high, taxation, as, well, as, by, sporadic, incursions, of, habsburg, and, russian, armies, deep, into, moldavian, territory, nonetheless, they, also, attempted, legislative, and, administrative, modernization, inspired, by, the, enlightenment, such, as, the, decision, by, constantine, mavrocordatos, to, salarize, public, offices, to, the, outrage, of, boyars, and, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, 1749, as, well, as, scarlat, callimachi, s, code, and, signified, a, decrease, in, ottoman, demands, after, the, threat, of, russian, annexation, became, real, and, the, prospects, of, a, better, life, led, to, waves, of, peasant, emigration, to, neighboring, lands, the, effects, of, ottoman, control, were, also, made, less, notable, after, the, 1774, treaty, of, k, k, kaynarca, allowed, russia, to, intervene, in, favour, of, ottoman, subjects, of, the, eastern, orthodox, faith, leading, to, campaigns, of, petitioning, by, the, moldavian, boyars, against, princely, policies, in, 1712, hotin, was, taken, over, by, the, ottomans, and, became, part, of, a, defensive, system, that, moldavian, princes, were, required, to, maintain, as, well, as, an, area, for, islamic, colonization, the, laz, community, in, 1775, moldavia, lost, to, the, habsburg, empire, its, northwestern, part, which, became, known, as, bukovina, for, moldavia, it, meant, both, an, important, territorial, loss, and, a, major, blow, to, the, cattle, trade, as, the, region, stood, on, the, trade, route, to, central, europe, the, treaty, of, jassy, in, 1792, forced, the, ottoman, empire, to, cede, yedisan, to, the, russian, empire, which, made, russian, presence, much, more, notable, given, that, the, empire, acquired, a, common, border, with, moldavia, the, first, effect, of, this, was, the, cession, of, the, eastern, half, of, moldavia, renamed, as, bessarabia, to, the, russian, empire, in, 1812, phanariote, rule, was, officially, ended, after, the, 1821, occupation, of, the, country, by, alexander, ypsilantis, s, filiki, eteria, during, the, greek, war, of, independence, the, subsequent, ottoman, retaliation, led, to, the, rule, of, ioan, sturdza, he, was, considered, the, first, of, a, new, system, since, the, ottomans, and, russia, had, agreed, in, 1826, to, allow, for, the, election, by, locals, of, rulers, over, the, two, danubian, principalities, and, convened, on, their, mandating, for, seven, year, terms, in, practice, a, new, foundation, to, reigns, in, moldavia, was, created, by, the, russo, turkish, war, 1828, 1829, beginning, a, period, of, russian, domination, over, the, two, countries, which, ended, only, in, 1856, begun, as, a, military, occupation, under, the, command, of, pavel, kiselyov, russian, domination, gave, wallachia, and, moldavia, which, were, not, removed, from, nominal, ottoman, control, the,

of, his, country, with, wallachia, and, of, romanian, romantic, nationalism, he, obtained, the, establishment, of, a, customs, union, between, the, two, countries, 1847, and, showed, support, for, radical, projects, favored, by, low, boyars, nevertheless, he, clamped, down, with, noted, violence, the, moldavian, revolutionary, attempt, in, the, last, days, of, march, 1848, grigore, alexandru, ghica, allowed, the, exiled, revolutionaries, to, return, to, moldavia, c, 1853, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, national, party, partida, na, ional, a, trans, boundary, group, of, radical, union, supporters, which, campaigned, for, a, single, state, under, a, foreign, dynasty, in, 1856, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, the, russian, empire, returned, to, moldavia, a, significant, territory, in, southern, bessarabia, including, a, part, of, budjak, organised, later, as, the, bolgrad, cahul, and, ismail, counties, russian, domination, ended, abruptly, after, the,

and, ottoman, opposition, and, british, reserves, the, union, program, as, demanded, by, radical, campaigners, was, debated, intensely, in, september, 1857, given, that, caimacam, nicolae, vogoride, had, perpetrated, fraud, in, elections, in, moldavia, the, powers, allowed, the, two, states, to, convene, ad, hoc, divans, which, were, to, decide, a, new, constitutional, framework, the, result, showed, overwhelming, support, for, the, union, as, the, creation, of, a, liberal, and, neutral, state, after, further, meetings, among, leaders, of, tutor, states, an, agreement, was, reached, the, paris, convention, whereby, a, limited, union, was, to, be, enforced, separate, governments, and, thrones, with, only, two, bodies, in, common, a, court, of, cassation, and, a, central, commission,

believed, that, the, romanians, took, the, roma, as, slaves, from, the, mongols, and, preserved, their, status, to, control, their, labor, other, historians, consider, that, the, roma, were, enslaved, while, captured, during, the, battles, with, the, tatars, the, practice, of, enslaving, prisoners, may, also, have, been, taken, from, the, mongols, the, ethnic, identity, of, the, tatar, slaves, is, unknown, they, could, have, been, captured, tatars, of, the, golden, horde, cumans, or, the, slaves, of, tatars, and, cumans, while, it, is, possible, that, some, romani, people, were, slaves, or, auxiliary, troops, of, the, mongols, or, tatars, most, of, them, came, from, south, of, the, danube, demonstrating, that, slavery, was, a, widespread, practice, the, tatar, slaves, smaller, in,

proposed, a, law, on, the, freeing, of, slaves, owned, by, the, church, and, state, by, the, 1850s, the, movement, gained, support, from, almost, the, whole, of, romanian, society, in, december, 1855,

to, the, status, of, taxpayers, citizens, support, for, the, abolitionists, was, reflected, in, romanian, literature, of, the, mid, 19th, century, the, issue, of, the, roma, slavery, became, a, theme, in, the, literary, works, of, various, liberal, and, romantic, intellectuals, many, of, whom, were, active, in, the, abolitionist, camp, the, romanian, abolitionist, movement, was, also, influenced, by, the, much, larger, movement, against, black, slavery, in, the, united, states, through, press, reports, and, through, a, translation, of, harriet, beecher, stowe, s, uncle, tom, s, cabin, translated, by, theodor, codrescu, and, first, published, in, ia, i, in, 1853, under, the, name, coliba, lui, mo, u, toma, sau, via, a, negrilor, n, sudul, statelor, unite, din, america, which,

saying, that, every, man, has, a, duty, to, defend, his, fatherland, according, to, polish, chronicler, jan, d, ugosz, if, someone, was, found, without, carrying, a, weapon, he, was, sentenced, to,

reach, up, to, 40, 000, was, recruited, from, all, the, free, peasantry, older, than, 14, and, strong, enough, to, carry, a, sword, or, use, a, bow, this, seldom, happened, for, such, a, lev, e, en, masse, was, devastating, for, both, economy, and, population, growth, in, the, battle, of, vaslui, stephen, had, to, summon, the, large, host, and, also, recruited, mercenary, troops, in, the, middle, ages, and, early, renaissance, the, moldavians, relied, on, light, cavalry, c, l, ra, i, which, used, hit, and, run, tactics, similar, to, those, of, the, tatars, this, gave, them, great, mobility, and, also, flexibility, in, case, they, found, it, more, suitable, to, dismount, their, horses, and, fight, in, hand, to, hand, combat, as, it, happened, in, 1422, when, 400, horse, archers, were, sent, to, aid, jagiellon, poland, moldavia, s, overlord, against, the, teutonic, knights, when, making, eye, contact, with, the, enemy, the, horse, archers, would, withdraw, to, a, nearby, forest, and, camouflage, themselves, with, leaves, and, branches, according, to, jan, d, ugosz, when, the, enemy, entered, the, wood, they, were, showered, with, arrows, and, defeated, the, heavy, cavalry, consisted, of, the, nobility, namely, the, boyars, and, their, guards, the, viteji, lit, brave, ones, small, nobility, and, the, curteni, court, cavalry, these, were, all, nominally, part, of, the,

the, moldavians, as, well, as, wallachians, favourite, military, doctrine, in, defensive, wars, was, a, scorched, earth, policy, combined, with, harassment, of, the, advancing, enemy, using, hit, and, run, tactics, and, disruption, of, communication, and, supply, lines, followed, by, a, large, scale, ambush, a, weakened, enemy, would, be, lured, in, a, place, where, it, would, find, itself, in, a, position, hard, or, impossible, to, defend, a, general, attack, would, follow, often, with, devastating, results, the, shattered, remains, of, what, was, once, the, enemy, army, would, be, pursued, closely, and, harassed, all, the, way, to, the, border, and, sometimes, beyond, a, typical, example, of, successful, employments, of, this, scenario, is, the, battle, of, vaslui, towards, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, especially, after, the, success, of, guns, and, cannons, mercenaries, became, a, dominant, force, in, the, country, s, military, with, the, economic, demands, created, by, the,
