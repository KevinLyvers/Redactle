the, kansas, city, metro, area, the, columbus, metro, area, and, greater, cleveland, the, term, west, was, applied, to, the, region, in, british, north, america, and, in, the, early, years, of, the, united, states, when, the, colonial, territories, had, not, extended, far, from, the, atlantic, coast, and, the, pacific, seaboard, was, generally, unknown, by, the, early, 19th, century, anything, west, of, appalachia, was, considered, american, frontier, over, time, the, american, frontier, moved, to, west, of, the, mississippi, river, during, the, colonial, period, the, upper, mississippi, watershed, including, the, valleys, of, the, missouri, river, and, the, illinois, river, which, were, settled, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, and, called, illinois, country, in, 1787, the, northwest, ordinance, was, enacted, creating, the, northwest, territory, which, was, bounded, by, the, great, lakes, and, the, ohio, and, mississippi, rivers, some, entities, in, the, midwest, have, northwest, in, their, names, for, historical, reasons, such, as, northwestern, university, in, illinois, one, of, the, earliest, late, 19th, century, uses, of, midwest, was, in, reference, to, kansas, and, nebraska, to, indicate, that, they, were, the, civilized, areas, of, the, west, a, source, in, the, 1920s, referred, to, the, midwest, included, within, this, territory, west, virginia, kentucky, tennessee, missouri, kansas, and, arkansas, another, term, applied, to, the, same, region, is, heartland, the, region, s, economy, is, a, mix, of, heavy, industry, and, agriculture, with, extensive, areas, forming, part, of, the, united, states, corn, belt, finance, and, services, such, as, medicine, and, education, are, becoming, increasingly, important, its, central, location, makes, it, a, transportation, crossroads, for, river, boats, railroads, autos, trucks, and, airplanes, politically, the, region, is, composed, of, swing, states, and, therefore, is, heavily, contested, and, often, decisive, in, elections, following, the, sociological, middletown, studies, of, 1929, which, were, based, on, muncie, indiana, commentators, took, midwestern, cities, and, the, midwest, generally, to, be, typical, of, the, united, states, earlier, the, rhetorical, question, will, it, play, in, peoria, had, become, a, stock, phrase, using, peoria, illinois, to, signal, whether, something, would, appeal, to, mainstream, america, as, of, 2010, the, midwest, has, a, higher, employment, to, population, ratio, than, the, northeastern, united, states, the, southern, united, states, or, the, western, united, states, among, the, native, americans, paleo, americans, cultures, were, the, earliest, in, north, america, with, a, presence, in, the, great, plains, and, great, lakes, areas, from, about, 12, 000, bce, to, around, 8, 000, bce, following, the, paleo, american, period, is, the, archaic, period, 8, 000, bce, to, 1, 000, bce, the, woodland, tradition, 1, 000, bce, to, 100, ce, and, the, mississippian, period, 900, to, 1500, ce, archeological, evidence, indicates, that, mississippian, culture, traits, probably, began, in, the, st, louis, missouri, area, and, spread, northwest, along, the, mississippi, and, illinois, rivers, and, entered, the, state, along, the, kankakee, river, system, it, also, spread, northward, into, indiana, along, the, wabash, tippecanoe, and, white, rivers, mississippian, peoples, in, the, midwest, were, mostly, farmers, who, followed, the, rich, flat, floodplains, of, midwestern, rivers, they, brought, with, them, a, well, developed, agricultural, complex, based, on, three, major, crops, maize, beans, and, squash, maize, or, corn, was, the, primary, crop, of, mississippian, farmers, they, gathered, a, wide, variety, of, seeds, nuts, and, berries, and, fished, and, hunted, for, fowl, to, supplement, their, diets, with, such, an, intensive, form, of, agriculture, this, culture, supported, large, populations, the, mississippi, period, was, characterized, by, a, mound, building, culture, the, mississippians, suffered, a, tremendous, population, decline, about, 1400, coinciding, with, the, global, climate, change, of, the, little, ice, age, their, culture, effectively, ended, before, 1492, the, major, tribes, of, the, great, lakes, region, included, the, hurons, ottawa, chippewas, or, ojibwas, potawatomis, winnebago, ho, chunk, menominees, sacs, neutrals, fox, and, the, miami, most, numerous, were, the, huron, and, ho, chunk, fighting, and, battle, were, often, launched, between, tribes, with, the, losers, forced, to, flee, most, are, of, the, algonquian, language, family, some, tribes, such, as, the, stockbridge, munsee, and, the, brothertown, are, also, algonkian, speaking, tribes, who, relocated, from, the, eastern, seaboard, to, the, great, lakes, region, in, the, 19th, century, the, oneida, belong, to, the, iroquois, language, group, and, the, ho, chunk, of, wisconsin, are, one, of, the, few, great, lakes, tribes, to, speak, a, siouan, language, american, indians, in, this, area, did, not, develop, a, written, form, of, language, in, the, 16th, century, the, natives, of, the, area, used, projectiles, and, tools, of, stone, bone, and, wood, to, hunt, and, farm, they, made, canoes, for, fishing, most, of, them, lived, in, oval, or, conical, wigwams, that, could, be, easily, moved, away, various, tribes, had, different, ways, of, living, the, ojibwas, were, primarily, hunters, and, fishing, was, also, important, in, the, ojibwas, economy, other, tribes, such, as, sac, fox, and, miami, both, hunted, and, farmed, they, were, oriented, toward, the, open, prairies, where, they, engaged, in, communal, hunts, for, buffalo, bison, in, the, northern, forests, the, ottawas, and, potawatomis, separated, into, small, family, groups, for, hunting, the, winnebagos, and, menominees, used, both, hunting, methods, interchangeably, and, built, up, widespread, trade, networks, extending, as, far, west, as, the, rockies, north, to, the, great, lakes, south, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, east, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, hurons, reckoned, descent, through, the, female, line, while, the, others, favored, the, patrilineal, method, all, tribes, were, governed, under, chiefdoms, or, complex, chiefdoms, for, example, hurons, were, divided, into, matrilineal, clans, each, represented, by, a, chief, in, the, town, council, where, they, met, with, a, town, chief, on, civic, matters, but, chippewa, people, s, social, and, political, life, was, simpler, than, that, of, settled, tribes, the, religious, beliefs, varied, among, tribes, hurons, believed, in, yoscaha, a, supernatural, being, who, lived, in, the, sky, and, was, believed, to, have, created, the, world, and, the, huron, people, at, death, hurons, thought, the, soul, left, the, body, to, live, in, a, village, in, the, sky, chippewas, were, a, deeply, religious, people, who, believed, in, the, great, spirit, they, worshiped, the, great, spirit, through, all, their, seasonal, activities, and, viewed, religion, as, a, private, matter, each, person, s, relation, with, his, personal, guardian, spirit, was, part, of, his, thinking, every, day, of, life, ottawa, and, potawatomi, people, had, very, similar, religious, beliefs, to, those, of, the, chippewas, in, the, ohio, river, valley, the, dominant, food, supply, was, not, hunting, but, agriculture, there, were, orchards, and, fields, of, crops, that, were, maintained, by, indigenous, women, corn, was, their, most, important, crop, the, plains, indians, are, the, indigenous, peoples, who, live, on, the, plains, and, rolling, hills, of, the, great, plains, of, north, america, their, colorful, equestrian, culture, and, famous, conflicts, with, settlers, and, the, us, army, have, made, the, plains, indians, archetypical, in, literature, and, art, for, american, indians, everywhere, plains, indians, are, usually, divided, into, two, broad, classifications, with, some, degree, of, overlap, the, first, group, were, fully, nomadic, following, the, vast, herds, of, buffalo, some, tribes, occasionally, engaged, in, agriculture, growing, tobacco, and, corn, primarily, these, included, the, blackfoot, arapaho, assiniboine, cheyenne, comanche, crow, gros, ventre, kiowa, lakota, lipan, plains, apache, or, kiowa, apache, plains, cree, plains, ojibwe, sarsi, shoshone, stoney, and, tonkawa, the, second, group, of, plains, indians, sometimes, referred, to, as, prairie, indians, were, the, semi, sedentary, tribes, who, in, addition, to, hunting, buffalo, lived, in, villages, and, raised, crops, these, included, the, arikara, hidatsa, iowa, kaw, or, kansa, kitsai, mandan, missouria, nez, perce, omaha, osage, otoe, pawnee, ponca, quapaw, santee, wichita, and, yankton, the, nomadic, tribes, of, the, great, plains, survived, on, hunting, some, of, their, major, hunts, centered, on, deer, and, buffalo, some, tribes, are, described, as, part, of, the, buffalo, culture, sometimes, called, for, the, american, bison, although, the, plains, indians, hunted, other, animals, such, as, elk, or, antelope, bison, was, their, primary, game, food, source, bison, flesh, hide, and, bones, from, bison, hunting, provided, the, chief, source, of, raw, materials, for, items, that, plains, indians, made, including, food, cups, decorations, crafting, tools, knives, and, clothing, the, tribes, followed, the, bison, s, seasonal, grazing, and, migration, the, plains, indians, lived, in, teepees, because, they, were, easily, disassembled, and, allowed, the, nomadic, life, of, following, game, when, spanish, horses, were, obtained, the, plains, tribes, rapidly, integrated, them, into, their, daily, lives, by, the, early, 18th, century, many, tribes, had, fully, adopted, a, horse, culture, before, their, adoption, of, guns, the, plains, indians, hunted, with, spears, bows, and, bows, and, arrows, and, various, forms, of, clubs, the, use, of, horses, by, the, plains, indians, made, hunting, and, warfare, much, easier, among, the, most, powerful, and, dominant, tribes, were, the, dakota, or, sioux, who, occupied, large, amounts, of, territory, in, the, great, plains, of, the, midwest, the, area, of, the, great, sioux, nation, spread, throughout, the, south, and, midwest, up, into, the, areas, of, minnesota, and, stretching, out, west, into, the, rocky, mountains, at, the, same, time, they, occupied, the, heart, of, prime, buffalo, range, and, also, an, excellent, region, for, furs, they, could, sell, to, french, and, american, traders, for, goods, such, as, guns, the, sioux, dakota, became, the, most, powerful, of, the, plains, tribes, and, the, greatest, threat, to, american, expansion, the, sioux, comprise, three, major, divisions, based, on, siouan, dialect, and, subculture, today, the, sioux, maintain, many, separate, tribal, governments, scattered, across, several, reservations, communities, and, reserves, in, the, dakotas, nebraska, minnesota, and, montana, in, the, united, states, as, well, as, manitoba, and, southern, saskatchewan, in, canada, the, theory, of, the, middle, ground, was, introduced, in, richard, white, s, seminal, work, the, middle, ground, indians, empires, and, republics, in, the, great, lakes, region, 1650, 1815, originally, published, in, 1991, white, defines, the, middle, ground, like, so, the, middle, ground, is, the, place, in, between, cultures, peoples, and, in, between, empires, and, the, non, state, world, of, villages, it, is, a, place, where, many, of, the, north, american, subjects, and, allies, of, empires, lived, it, is, the, area, between, the, historical, foreground, of, european, invasion, and, occupation, and, the, background, of, indian, defeat, and, retreat, white, specifically, designates, the, lands, bordering, the, rivers, flowing, into, the, northern, great, lakes, and, the, lands, south, of, the, lakes, to, the, ohio, as, the, location, of, the, middle, ground, this, includes, the, modern, midwestern, states, of, ohio, indiana, illinois, wisconsin, and, michigan, as, well, as, parts, of, canada, the, middle, ground, was, formed, on, the, foundations, of, mutual, accommodation, and, common, meanings, established, between, the, french, and, the, indians, that, then, transformed, and, degraded, as, both, were, steadily, lost, as, the, french, ceded, their, influence, in, the, region, in, the, aftermath, of, their, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, and, the, louisiana, purchase, major, aspects, of, the, middle, ground, include, blended, culture, the, fur, trade, native, alliances, with, both, the, french, and, british, conflicts, and, treaties, with, the, united, states, both, during, the, revolutionary, war, and, after, and, its, ultimate, clearing, erasure, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, european, settlement, of, the, area, began, in, the, 17th, century, following, french, exploration, of, the, region, and, became, known, as, new, france, including, the, illinois, country, the, french, period, began, with, the, exploration, of, the, saint, lawrence, river, by, jacques, cartier, in, 1534, and, ending, with, their, cessation, of, the, majority, of, their, holdings, in, north, america, to, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, in, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, in, 1673, the, governor, of, new, france, sent, jacques, marquette, a, catholic, priest, and, missionary, and, louis, jolliet, a, fur, trader, to, map, the, way, to, the, northwest, passage, to, the, pacific, they, traveled, through, michigan, s, upper, peninsula, to, the, northern, tip, of, lake, michigan, on, canoes, they, crossed, the, massive, lake, and, landed, at, present, day, green, bay, wisconsin, they, entered, the, mississippi, river, on, 17, june, 1673, marquette, and, jolliet, were, the, first, to, map, the, northern, portion, of, the, mississippi, river, they, confirmed, that, it, was, easy, to, travel, from, the, st, lawrence, river, through, the, great, lakes, all, the, way, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, by, water, that, the, native, peoples, who, lived, along, the, route, were, generally, friendly, and, that, the, natural, resources, of, the, lands, in, between, were, extraordinary, new, france, officials, led, by, lasalle, followed, up, and, erected, a, 4, 000, mile, 6, 400, km, network, of, fur, trading, posts, the, fur, trade, was, an, integral, part, of, early, european, and, indian, relations, it, was, the, foundation, upon, which, their, interactions, were, built, and, was, a, system, that, would, evolve, over, time, goods, often, traded, included, guns, clothing, blankets, strouds, cloth, tobacco, silver, and, alcohol, the, french, and, indian, exchange, of, goods, was, called, an, exchange, of, gifts, rather, than, a, trade, these, gifts, held, greater, meaning, to, the, relationship, between, the, two, than, a, simple, economic, exchange, because, the, trade, itself, was, inseparable, from, the, social, relations, it, fostered, and, the, alliance, it, created, in, the, meshed, french, and, algonquian, system, of, trade, the, algonquian, familial, metaphor, of, a, father, and, his, children, shaped, the, political, relationship, between, the, french, and, the, natives, in, this, region, the, french, regarded, as, the, metaphoric, father, were, expected, to, provide, for, the, needs, of, the, algonquians, and, in, return, the, algonquians, the, metaphoric, children, would, be, obligated, to, assist, and, obey, them, traders, coming, into, indian, villages, facilitated, this, system, of, symbolic, exchange, to, establish, or, maintain, alliances, and, friendships, marriage, also, became, an, important, aspect, of, the, trade, in, both, the, ohio, river, valley, and, the, french, pays, d, en, haut, with, the, temporary, closing, of, the, french, fur, trade, from, 1690, to, 1716, and, beyond, french, fur, traders, were, forced, to, abandon, most, posts, and, those, remaining, in, the, region, became, illegal, traders, who, potentially, sought, these, marriages, to, secure, their, safety, another, benefit, for, french, traders, marrying, indian, women, was, that, the, indian, women, were, in, charge, of, the, processing, of, the, pelts, necessary, to, the, fur, trade, women, were, integral, to, the, fur, trade, and, their, contributions, were, lauded, so, much, so, that, the, absence, of, the, involvement, of, an, indian, woman, was, once, cited, as, the, cause, for, a, trader, s, failure, when, the, french, fur, trade, re, opened, in, 1716, upon, the, discovery, that, their, overstock, of, pelts, had, been, ruined, legal, french, traders, continued, to, marry, indian, women, and, remain, in, their, villages, with, the, growing, influence, of, women, in, the, fur, trade, also, came, the, increasing, demand, of, cloth, which, very, quickly, grew, to, be, the, most, desired, trade, good, english, traders, entered, the, ohio, country, as, a, serious, competitor, to, the, french, in, the, fur, trade, around, the, 1690s, english, and, later, british, traders, almost, consistently, offered, the, indians, better, goods, and, better, rates, than, the, french, with, the, indians, being, able, to, play, that, to, their, advantage, thrusting, the, french, and, the, british, into, competition, with, each, other, to, their, own, benefit, the, indian, demand, for, certain, kinds, of, cloth, in, particular, fueled, this, competition, this, however, changed, following, the, seven, years, war, with, britain, s, victory, over, france, and, the, cession, of, new, france, to, great, britain, the, british, attempted, to, establish, a, more, assertive, relationship, with, the, indians, of, the, pays, d, en, haut, eliminating, the, practise, of, gift, giving, which, they, now, saw, as, unnecessary, this, in, combination, with, an, underwhelming, trade, relationship, with, a, surplus, of, whiskey, increase, in, prices, generally, and, a, shortage, of, other, goods, led, to, unrest, among, the, indians, that, was, exacerbated, by, the, decision, to, significantly, reduce, the, amount, of, rum, being, traded, a, product, that, british, merchants, had, been, including, in, the, trade, for, years, this, would, eventually, culminate, in, pontiac, s, war, which, broke, out, in, 1763, following, the, conflict, the, british, government, was, forced, to, compromise, and, loosely, re, created, a, trade, system, that, was, an, echo, of, the, french, one, while, french, control, ended, in, 1763, after, their, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, most, of, the, several, hundred, french, settlers, in, small, villages, along, the, mississippi, river, and, its, tributaries, remained, and, were, not, disturbed, by, the, new, british, administration, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, spain, was, given, louisiana, the, area, west, of, the, mississippi, st, louis, and, ste, genevieve, in, missouri, were, the, main, towns, but, there, was, little, new, settlement, france, regained, louisiana, from, spain, in, exchange, for, tuscany, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, san, ildefonso, in, 1800, napoleon, had, lost, interest, in, re, establishing, a, french, colonial, empire, in, north, america, following, the, haitian, revolution, and, together, with, the, fact, that, france, could, not, effectively, defend, louisiana, from, a, possible, british, attack, he, sold, the, territory, to, the, united, states, in, the, louisiana, purchase, of, 1803, meanwhile, the, british, maintained, forts, and, trading, posts, in, u, s, territory, refusing, to, give, them, up, until, 1796, by, the, jay, treaty, american, settlement, began, either, via, routes, over, the, appalachian, mountains, or, through, the, waterways, of, the, great, lakes, fort, pitt, now, pittsburgh, at, the, source, of, the, ohio, river, became, the, main, base, for, settlers, moving, into, the, midwest, marietta, ohio, in, 1787, became, the, first, settlement, in, ohio, but, not, until, the, defeat, of, native, american, tribes, at, the, battle, of, fallen, timbers, in, 1794, was, large, scale, settlement, possible, large, numbers, also, came, north, from, kentucky, into, southern, ohio, indiana, and, illinois, the, region, s, fertile, soil, produced, corn, and, vegetables, most, farmers, were, self, sufficient, they, cut, trees, and, claimed, the, land, then, sold, it, to, newcomers, and, then, moved, further, west, to, repeat, the, process, settlers, without, legal, claims, called, squatters, had, been, moving, into, the, midwest, for, years, before, 1776, they, pushed, further, and, further, down, the, ohio, river, during, the, 1760s, and, 1770s, and, sometimes, engaged, in, conflict, with, the, native, americans, british, officials, were, outraged, these, squatters, were, characterized, by, british, general, thomas, gage, as, too, numerous, too, lawless, and, licentious, ever, to, be, restrained, and, regarded, them, as, almost, out, of, reach, of, law, and, government, neither, the, endeavors, of, government, or, fear, of, indians, has, kept, them, properly, within, bounds, the, british, had, a, long, standing, goal, of, establishing, a, native, american, buffer, state, in, the, american, midwest, to, resist, american, westward, expansion, with, victory, in, the, american, revolution, the, new, government, considered, evicting, the, squatters, from, areas, that, were, now, federally, owned, public, lands, in, 1785, soldiers, under, general, josiah, harmar, were, sent, into, the, ohio, country, to, destroy, the, crops, and, burn, down, the, homes, of, any, squatters, they, found, living, there, but, overall, the, federal, policy, was, to, move, indians, to, western, lands, such, as, the, indian, territory, in, modern, oklahoma, and, allow, a, very, large, numbers, of, farmers, to, replace, a, small, number, of, hunters, congress, repeatedly, debated, how, to, legalize, settlements, on, the, one, hand, whigs, such, as, henry, clay, wanted, the, government, to, get, maximum, revenue, and, also, wanted, stable, middle, class, law, abiding, settlements, of, the, sort, that, supported, towns, and, bankers, jacksonian, democrats, such, as, thomas, hart, benton, wanted, the, support, of, poor, farmers, who, reproduced, rapidly, had, little, cash, and, were, eager, to, acquire, cheap, land, in, the, west, democrats, did, not, want, a, big, government, and, keeping, revenues, low, helped, that, cause, democrats, avoided, words, like, squatter, and, regarded, actual, settlers, as, those, who, gained, title, to, land, settled, on, it, and, then, improved, upon, it, by, building, a, house, clearing, the, ground, and, planting, crops, a, number, of, means, facilitated, the, legal, settlement, of, the, territories, in, the, midwest, land, speculation, federal, public, land, auctions, bounty, land, grants, in, lieu, of, pay, to, military, veterans, and, later, preemption, rights, for, squatters, the, squatters, became, pioneers, and, were, increasingly, able, to, purchase, the, lands, on, which, they, had, settled, for, the,

the, first, statewide, meeting, of, the, new, party, its, membership, included, many, yankees, out, of, new, england, and, new, york, who, had, settled, the, upper, midwest, the, party, opposed, the, expansion, of, slavery, and, stressed, the, protestant, ideals, of, thrift, a, hard, work, ethic, self, reliance, democratic, decision, making, and, religious, tolerance, in, the, early, 1890s, the,

midwest, especially, the, areas, west, of, chicago, has, always, been, a, stronghold, of, isolationism, a, belief, that, america, should, not, involve, itself, in, foreign, entanglements, this, position, was, largely, based, on, the, many, german, american, and, swedish, american, communities, isolationist, leaders, included, the, la, follettes, ohio, s, robert, a, taft, and, colonel, robert, mccormick, publisher, of, the, chicago, tribune, yankee, settlers, from, new, england, started, arriving, in, ohio, before, 1800, and, spread, throughout, the, northern, half, of, the, midwest, most, of, them, started, as, farmers, but, later, the, larger, proportion, moved, to, towns, and, cities, as, entrepreneurs, businessmen, and, urban, professionals, since, its, beginnings, in, the, 1830s, chicago, has, grown, to, dominate, the, midwestern, metropolis, landscape, for, over, a, century, historian, john, bunker, has, examined, the, worldview, of, the, yankee, settlers, in, the, midwest, because, they, arrived, first, and, had, a, strong, sense, of, community, and, mission, yankees, were, able, to, transplant, new, england, institutions, values, and, mores, altered, only, by, the, conditions, of, frontier, life, they, established, a, public, culture, that, emphasized, the, work, ethic, the, sanctity, of, private, property, individual, responsibility, faith, in,

believed, that, there, was, a, public, interest, that, transcends, particular, and, stick, ambitions, regarding, themselves, as, the, elect, and, just, in, a, world, rife, with, sin, air, and, corruption, they, felt, a, strong, moral, obligation, to, define, and, enforce, standards, of, community, and, personal, behavior, this, pietistic, worldview, was, substantially, shared, by, british, scandinavian, swiss, english, canadian, and, dutch, reformed, immigrants, as, well, as, by, german, protestants, and, many, of, the, forty, eighters, midwestern, politics, pitted, yankees, against, the, german, catholics, and, lutherans, who, were, often, led, by, the, irish, catholics, these, large, groups, buenker, argues, generally, subscribed, to, the, work, ethic, a, strong, sense, of, community, and, activist, government, but, were, less, committed, to, economic, individualism, and, privatism, and, ferociously, opposed, to, government, supervision, of, the, personal, habits, southern, and, eastern, european, immigrants, generally, leaned, more, toward, the, germanic, view, of, things, while, modernization, industrialization, and, urbanization, modified, nearly, everyone,

the, midwest, the, first, and, foremost, was, the, ohio, river, which, flowed, into, the, mississippi, river, development, of, the, region, was, halted, until, 1795, by, spain, s, control, of, the, southern, part, of, the, mississippi, and, its, refusal, to, allow, the, shipment, of, american, crops, down, the, river, and, into, the, atlantic, ocean, this, was, changed, with, the, 1795, signing, of, pinckney, s, treaty, the, second, waterway, is, the, network, of, routes, within, the, great, lakes, the, opening, of, the, erie, canal, in, 1825, completed, an, all, water, shipping, route, more, direct, than, the, mississippi, to, new, york, and, the, seaport, of, new, york, city, in, 1848, the, illinois, and, michigan, canal, breached, the, continental, divide, spanning, the, chicago, portage, and, linking, the, waters, of, the, great, lakes, with, those, of, the, mississippi, valley, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, lakeport, and, river, cities, grew, up, to, handle, these, new, shipping, routes, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, lakes, became, a, conduit, for, iron, ore, from, the, mesabi, range, of, minnesota, to, steel, mills, in, the, mid, atlantic, states, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, completed, in, 1959, opened, the, midwest, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, third, waterway, the, missouri, river, extended, water, travel, from, the, mississippi, almost, to,

traffic, the, commodities, that, the, midwest, funneled, into, the, erie, canal, down, the, ohio, river, contributed, to, the, wealth, of, new, york, city, which, overtook, boston, and, philadelphia, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the, region, got, its, first, railroads, and, the, railroad, junction, in, chicago, became, the, world, s, largest, during, the, century, chicago, became, the, nation, s, railroad, center, by, 1910, over, 20, railroads, operated, passenger, service, out, of, six, different, downtown, terminals, even, today, a, century, after, henry, ford, six, class, i, railroads, union, pacific, bnsf, norfolk, southern, csx, canadian, national, and, canadian, pacific, meet, in, chicago, in, the, period, from, 1890, to, 1930, many, midwestern, cities, were, connected, by, electric, interurban, railroads, similar, to, streetcars, the, midwest, had, more, interurbans, than, any, other, region, in, 1916, ohio, led, all, states, with, 2, 798, miles, 4, 503, km, indiana, followed, with, 1, 825, miles, 2, 937, km, these, two, states, alone, had, almost, a, third, of, the, country, s, interurban, trackage, the, nation, s, largest, interurban, junction, was, in, indianapolis, during, the, decade, of, the, early, 1900s, that, city, s, 38, percent, growth, in, population, was, attributed, largely, to, the, interurban, competition, with, automobiles, and, buses, undermined, the, interurban, and, other, railroad, passenger, business, by, 1900, detroit, was, the, world, center, of, the, auto, industry, and, soon, practically, every, city, within, 200, miles, 320, km, was, producing, auto, parts, that, fed, into, its, giant, factories, in, 1903, henry, ford, founded, the, ford, motor, company, ford, s, manufacturing, and, those, of, automotive, pioneers, william, c, durant, the, dodge, brothers, packard, and, walter, chrysler, established, detroit, s, status, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, the, world, s, automotive, capital, the, proliferation, of, businesses, created, a, synergy, that, also, encouraged, truck, manufacturers, such, as, rapid, and, grabowsky, the, growth, of, the, auto, industry, was, reflected, by, changes, in, businesses, throughout, the, midwest, and, nation, with, the, development, of, garages, to, service, vehicles, and, gas, stations, as, well, as, factories, for, parts, and, tires, today, greater, detroit, remains, home, to, general, motors, chrysler, and, the, ford, motor, company, the, northwest, ordinance, region, comprising, the, heart, of, the, midwest, was, the, first, large, region, of, the, united, states, that, prohibited, slavery, the, northeastern, united, states, emancipated, slaves, into, the, 1830s, the, regional, southern, boundary, was, the, ohio, river, the, border, of, freedom, and, slavery, in, american, history, and, literature, see, uncle, tom, s, cabin, by, harriet, beecher, stowe, and, beloved, by, toni, morrison, the, midwest, particularly, ohio, provided, the, primary, routes, for, the, underground, railroad, whereby, midwesterners, assisted, slaves, to, freedom, from, their, crossing, of, the, ohio, river, through, their, departure, on, lake, erie, to, canada, created, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, underground, railroad, was, at, its, height, between, 1850, and, 1860, one, estimate, suggests, that, by, 1850, 100, 000, slaves, had, escaped, via, the, underground, railroad, the, underground, railroad, consisted, of, meeting, points, secret, routes, transportation, and, safe, houses, and, assistance, provided, by, abolitionist, sympathizers, individuals, were, often, organized, in, small, independent, groups, this, helped, to, maintain, secrecy, because, individuals, knew, some, connecting, stations, along, the, route, but, knew, few, details, of, their, immediate, area, escaped, slaves, would, move, north, along, the, route, from, one, way, station, to, the, next, although, the, fugitives, sometimes, traveled, on, boat, or, train, they, usually, traveled, on, foot, or, by, wagon, the, region, was, shaped, by, the, relative, absence, of, slavery, except, for, missouri, pioneer, settlement, education, in, one, room, free, public, schools, democratic, notions, brought, by, american, revolutionary, war, veterans, protestant, faiths, and, experimentation, and, agricultural, wealth, transported, on, the, ohio, river, riverboats, flatboats, canal, boats, and, railroads, the, first, violent, conflicts, leading, up, to, the, civil, war, occurred, between, two, neighboring, midwestern, states, kansas, and, missouri, involving, anti, slavery, free, staters, and, pro, slavery, border, ruffian, elements, that, took, place, in, the, kansas, territory, and, the, western, frontier, towns, of, missouri, roughly, between, 1854, and, 1858, at, the, heart, of, the, conflict, was, the, question, of, whether, kansas, would, enter, the, union, as, a, free, state, or, slave, state, as, such, bleeding, kansas, was, a, proxy, war, between, northerners, and, southerners, over, the, issue, of, slavery, the, term, bleeding, kansas, was, coined, by, horace, greeley, of, the, new, york, tribune, the, events, it, encompasses, directly, presaged, the, civil, war, the, immediate, cause, of, the, events, was, the, kansas, nebraska, act, of, 1854, the, act, created, the, territories, of, kansas, and, nebraska, opened, new, lands, that, would, help, settlement, in, them, repealed, the, missouri, compromise, and, allowed, settlers, in, those, territories, to, determine, through, popular, sovereignty, whether, to, allow, slavery, within, their, boundaries, it, was, hoped, the, act, would, ease, relations, between, the, north, and, the, south, because, the, south, could, expand, slavery, to, new, territories, but, the, north, still, had, the, right, to, abolish, slavery, in, its, states, instead, opponents, denounced, the, law, as, a, concession, to, the, slave, power, of, the, south, the, new, republican, party, born, in, the, ripon, wisconsin, in, 1854, and, created, in, opposition, to, the, act, aimed, to, stop, the, expansion, of, slavery, and, soon, emerged, as, the, dominant, force, throughout, the, north, an, ostensibly, democratic, idea, popular, sovereignty, stated, that, the, inhabitants, of, each, territory, or, state, should, decide, whether, it, would, be, a, free, or, slave, state, however, this, resulted, in, immigration, en, masse, to, kansas, by, activists, from, both, sides, at, one, point, kansas, had, two, separate, governments, each, with, its, own, constitution, although, only, one, was, federally, recognized, on, january, 29, 1861, kansas, was, admitted, to, the, union, as, a, free, state, less, than, three, months, before, the, battle, of, fort, sumter, officially, began, the, civil, war, the, calm, in, kansas, was, shattered, in, may, 1856, by, two, events, that, are, often, regarded, as, the, opening, shots, of, the, civil, war, on, may, 21, the, free, soil, town, of, lawrence, kansas, was, sacked, by, an, armed, pro, slavery, force, from, missouri, a, few, days, later, the, sacking, of, lawrence, led, abolitionist, john, brown, and, six, of, his, followers, to, execute, five, men, along, the, pottawatomie, creek, in, franklin, county, kansas, in, retaliation, the, so, called, border, war, lasted, for, another, four, months, from, may, through, october, between, armed, bands, of, pro, slavery, and, free, soil, men, the, u, s, army, had, two, garrisons, in, kansas, the, first, cavalry, regiment, at, fort, leavenworth, and, the, second, dragoons, and, sixth, infantry, at, fort, riley, the, skirmishes, endured, until, a, new, governor, john, w, geary, managed, to, prevail, upon, the, missourians, to, return, home, in, late, 1856, a, fragile, peace, followed, but, violent, outbreaks, continued, intermittently, for, several, more, years, national, reaction, to, the, events, in, kansas, demonstrated, how, deeply, divided, the, country, had, become, the, border, ruffians, were, widely, applauded, in, the, south, even, though, their, actions, had, cost, the, lives, of, numerous, people, in, the, north, the, murders, committed, by, brown, and, his, followers, were, ignored, by, most, and, lauded, by, a, few, the, civil, conflict, in, kansas, was, a, product, of, the, political, fight, over, slavery, federal, troops, were, not, used, to, decide, a, political, question, but, they, were, used, by, successive, territorial, governors, to, pacify, the, territory, so, that, the, political, question, of, slavery, in, kansas, could, finally, be, decided, by, peaceful, legal, and, political, means, the, election, of, abraham, lincoln, in, november, 1860, was, the, final, trigger, for, secession, by, the, southern, states, efforts, at, compromise, including, the, corwin, amendment, and, the, crittenden, compromise, failed, southern, leaders, feared, that, lincoln, would, stop, the, expansion, of, slavery, and, put, it, on, a, course, toward, extinction, the, u, s, federal, government, was, supported, by, 20, mostly, northern, free, states, in, which, slavery, already, had, been, abolished, and, by, five, slave, states, that, became, known, as, the, border, states, all, of, the, midwestern, states, but, one, missouri, banned, slavery, though, most, battles, were, fought, in, the, south, skirmishes, between, kansas, and, missouri, continued, until, culmination, with, the, lawrence, massacre, on, august, 21, 1863, also, known, as, quantrill, s, raid, the, massacre, was, a, rebel, guerrilla, attack, by, quantrill, s, raiders, led, by, william, clarke, quantrill, on, pro, union, lawrence, kansas, quantrill, s, band, of, 448, missouri, guerrillas, raided, and, plundered, lawrence, killing, more, than, 150, and, burning, all, the, business, buildings, and, most, of, the, dwellings, pursued, by, federal, troops, the, band, escaped, to, missouri, lawrence, was, targeted, because, of, the, town, s, long, time, support, of, abolition, and, its, reputation, as, a, center, for, redlegs, and, jayhawkers, which, were, free, state, militia, and, vigilante, groups, known, for, attacking, families, in, missouri, s, pro, slavery, western, counties, by, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, european, immigrants, bypassed, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, to,

heart, of, industrial, domination, and, innovation, was, in, the, great, lakes, states, of, the, midwest, which, only, began, its, slow, decline, by, the, late, 20th, century, a, flourishing, economy, brought, residents, from, rural, communities, and, immigrants, from, abroad, manufacturing, and, retail, and, finance, sectors, became, dominant, influencing, the, american, economy, in, addition, to,

at, haymarket, square, in, chicago, in, 1886, where, a, bomb, was, thrown, among, police, and, eight, anarchists, were, convicted, of, conspiracy, for, murder, an, event, known, as, the, haymarket, affair, the, pullman, strike, of, 1894, was, a, shutdown, of, most, rail, traffic, in, the, midwest, and, west, it, turned, violent, and, was, broken, by, federal, troops, eugene, v, debs, leader, of, the, striking, american, railway, union, went, to, prison, where, he, converted, to, socialism, his, version, of, socialism, appealed, to, some, immigrant, groups, but, was, too, radical, for, most, midwesterners, farmers, distrusted, big, business, and, adopted, cooperative, arrangements, such, as, those, offered, by, the, grange, in, the, 1870s, or, the, farmers, alliance, in, the, 1890s, they, wanted, cooperatives, controlled, by, farmers, to, handle, farm, products, a, reduction, in, rail, freight, rates, and, the, coining, of, silver, money, to, raise, prices, the, alliance, turned, to, political, action, with, the, creation, of, the, populist, party, in, 1892, it, had, local, success, in, the, wheat, belt, and, silver, mining, areas, this, venture, as, a, third, party, was, short,

the, machine, was, temporarily, defeated, allowing, reformers, to, launch, the, wisconsin, idea, of, expanded, democracy, this, idea, included, major, reforms, such, as, direct, primaries, campaign,

laws, la, follette, promoted, government, regulation, of, railroads, public, utilities, factories, and, banks, although, la, follette, lost, influence, in, the, national, party, in, 1912, the, wisconsin, reforms, became, a, model, for, progressivism, in, other, states, the, vast, central, area, of, the, u, s, into, canada, is, a, landscape, of, low, flat, to, rolling, terrain, in, the, interior, plains, ideal, for, farming, and, growing, food, most, of, its, eastern, two, thirds, form, the, interior, lowlands, the, lowlands, gradually, rise, westward, from, a, line, passing, through, eastern, kansas, up, to, over, 5, 000, feet, 1, 500, m, in, the, unit, known, as, the, great, plains, most, of, the, great, plains, area, is, now, farmed, while, these, states, are, for, the, most, part, relatively, flat, consisting, either, of, plains, or, of, rolling, and, small, hills, there, is, a, measure, of, geographical, variation, in, particular, the, following, areas, exhibit, a, high, degree, of, topographical, variety, the, eastern, midwest, near, the, foothills, of, the, appalachian, mountains, the, great, lakes, basin, the, heavily, glaciated, uplands, of, the, north, shore, of, lake, superior, in, minnesota, part, of, the, ruggedly, volcanic, canadian, shield, the, ozark, mountains, of, southern, missouri, and, the, deeply, eroded, driftless, area, of, southwest, wisconsin, southeast, minnesota, northeast, iowa, and, northwest, illinois, proceeding, westward, the, appalachian, plateau, topography, gradually, gives, way, to, gently, rolling, hills, and, then, in, central, ohio, to, flat, lands, converted, principally, to, farms, and, urban, areas, this, is, the, beginning, of, the, vast, interior, plains, of, north, america, as, a, result, prairies, cover, most, of, the, great, plains, states, iowa, and, much, of, illinois, lie, within, an, area, called, the, prairie, peninsula, an, eastward, extension, of, prairies, that, borders, conifer, and, mixed, forests, to, the, north, and, hardwood, deciduous, forests, to, the, east, and, south, geographers, subdivide, the, interior, plains, into, the, interior, lowlands, and, the, great, plains, on, the, basis, of, elevation, the, lowlands, are, mostly, below, 1, 500, feet, 460, m, above, sea, level, whereas, the, great, plains, to, the, west, are, higher, rising, in, colorado, to, around, 5, 000, feet, 1, 500, m, the, lowlands, then, are, confined, to, parts, of, iowa, illinois, indiana, ohio, michigan, tennessee, and, kentucky, missouri, and, arkansas, have, regions, of, lowlands, elevations, contrasting, with, their, ozark, region, within, the, interior, highlands, eastern, ohio, s, hills, are, an, extension, of, the, appalachian, plateau, the, interior, plains, are, largely, coincident, with, the, vast, mississippi, river, drainage, system, other, major, components, are, the, missouri, and, ohio, rivers, these, rivers, have, for, tens, of, millions, of, years, been, eroding, downward, into, the, mostly, horizontal, sedimentary, rocks, of, paleozoic, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, ages, the, modern, mississippi, river, system, has, developed, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, of, the, cenozoic, rainfall, decreases, from, east, to, west, resulting, in, different, types, of, prairies, with, the, tallgrass, prairie, in, the, wetter, eastern, region, mixed, grass, prairie, in, the, central, great, plains, and, shortgrass, prairie, towards, the, rain, shadow, of, the, rockies, today, these, three, prairie, types, largely, correspond, to, the, corn, soybean, area, the, wheat, belt, and, the, western, rangelands, respectively, much, of, the, coniferous, forests, of, the, upper, midwest, were, clear, cut, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, mixed, hardwood, forests, have, become, a, major, component, of, the, new, woodlands, since, then, the, majority, of, the, midwest, can, now, be, categorized, as, urbanized, areas, or, pastoral, agricultural, areas, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, midwestern, to, refer, to, a, region, of, the, central, u, s, occurred, in, 1886, midwest, appeared, in, 1894, and, midwesterner, in, 1916, one, of, the, earliest, late, 19th, century, uses, of, midwest, was, in, reference, to, kansas, and, nebraska, to, indicate, that, they, were, the, civilized, areas, of, the, west, the, term, midwestern, has, been, in, use, since, the, 1880s, to, refer, to, portions, of, the, central, united, states, a, variant, term, middle, west, has, been, used, since, the, 19th, century, and, remains, relatively, common, traditional, definitions, of, the, midwest, include, the, northwest, ordinance, old, northwest, states, and, many, states, that, were, part, of, the, louisiana, purchase, the, states, of, the, old, northwest, are, also, known, as, great, lakes, states, and, are, east, north, central, in, the, united, states, the, ohio, river, runs, along, the, southeastern, section, and, the, mississippi, river, runs, north,

of, exports, and, thousands, of, jobs, the, area, consists, of, some, of, the, richest, farming, land, in, the, world, the, region, s, fertile, soil, combined, with, the, steel, plow, has, made, it, possible, for, farmers, to, produce, abundant, harvests, of, grain, and, cereal, crops, including, corn, wheat, soybeans, oats, and, barley, to, become, known, today, as, the, nation, s, breadbasket, former, vice, president, henry, a, wallace, a, pioneer, of, hybrid, seeds, declared, in, 1956, that, the, corn, belt, developed, the, most, productive, agricultural, civilization, the, world, has, ever, seen, today, the, u, s, produces, 40, percent, of, the, world, crop, the, very, dense, soil, of, the, midwest, plagued, the, first, settlers, who, were, using, wooden, plows, which, were, more, suitable, for, loose, forest, soil, on, the, prairie, the, plows, bounced, around, and, the, soil, stuck, to, them, this, problem, was, solved, in, 1837, by, an, illinois, blacksmith, named, john, deere, who, developed, a, steel, moldboard, plow, that, was, stronger, and, cut, the, roots, making, the, fertile, soils, of, the, prairie, ready, for, farming, farms, spread, from, the, colonies, westward, along, with, the, settlers, in, cooler, regions, wheat, was, often, the, crop, of, choice, when, lands, were, newly, settled, leading, to, a, wheat, frontier, that, moved, westward, over, the, course, of, years, also, very, common, in, the, antebellum, midwest, was, farming, corn, while, raising, hogs, complementing, each, other, especially, since, it, was, difficult, to, get, grain, to, market, before, the, canals, and, railroads, after, the, wheat, frontier, had, passed, through, an, area, more, diversified, farms, including, dairy, and, beef, cattle, generally, took, its, place, the, introduction, and, broad, adoption, of, scientific, agriculture, since, the, mid, 19th, century, contributed, to, economic, growth, in, the, united, states, this, development, was, facilitated, by, the, morrill, act, and, the, hatch, act, of, 1887, which, established, in, each, state, a, land, grant, university, with, a, mission, to, teach, and, study, agriculture, and, a, federally, funded, system, of, agricultural, experiment, stations, and, cooperative, extension, networks, which, place, extension, agents, in, each, state, iowa, state, university, became, the,

partially, because, of, world, war, ii, and, the, need, for, domestic, sources, of, fats, oils, and, meal, between, 1930, and, 1942, the, united, states, share, of, world, soybean, production, skyrocketed, from, 3, percent, to, 46, 5, percent, largely, as, a, result, of, increase, in, the, midwest, and, by, 1969, it, had, risen, to, 76, percent, iowa, and, illinois, rank, first, and,
