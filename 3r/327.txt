the, eurasian, steppe, also, called, the, great, steppe, or, the, steppes, is, the, vast, steppe, ecoregion, of, eurasia, in, the, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, it, stretches, through, hungary, bulgaria, romania, moldova, ukraine, southern, russia, kazakhstan, xinjiang, mongolia, and, manchuria, with, one, major, exclave, the, pannonian, steppe, located, mostly, in, hungary, since, the, paleolithic, age, the, steppe, route, has, been, the, main, overland, route, between, europe, western, asia, central, asia, east, asia, and, south, asia, economically, politically, and, culturally, the, steppe, route, is, a, predecessor, not, only, of, the, silk, road, which, developed, during, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, but, also, of, the, eurasian, land, bridge, in, the, modern, era, it, has, been, home, to, nomadic, empires, and, many, large, tribal, confederations, and, ancient, states, throughout, history, such, as, the, xiongnu, scythia, cimmeria, sarmatia, hunnic, empire, sogdia, xianbei, mongol, empire, and, g, kt, rk, khaganate, the, eurasian, steppe, extends, for, 8, 000, kilometres, 5, 000, miles, from, near, the, mouth, of, the, danube, in, romania, to, the, western, edge, of, manchuria, it, is, bounded, on, the, north, by, the, forests, of, european, russia, and, asian, russia, or, siberia, there, is, no, clear, southern, boundary, although, the, land, becomes, increasingly, dry, as, one, moves, south, the, steppe, narrows, at, two, points, dividing, it, into, three, major, parts, the, pannonian, steppe, is, a, western, exclave, of, the, eurasian, steppe, separated, from, the, main, steppe, by, the, carpathian, mountains, it, is, found, in, modern, day, austria, hungary, romania, serbia, and, slovakia, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, is, the, main, european, end, of, the, eurasian, steppe, and, begins, near, the, mouth, of, the, danube, stretching, northeast, almost, to, kazan, and, then, southeast, to, the, southern, tip, of, the, ural, mountains, its, northern, edge, was, a, broad, band, of, forest, steppe, which, has, now, been, obliterated, by, the, conversion, of, the, whole, area, to, agricultural, land, in, the, southeast, the, black, sea, caspian, steppe, extends, between, the, black, sea, and, caspian, sea, to, the, caucasus, mountains, in, the, west, the, great, hungarian, plain, is, an, island, of, steppe, separated, from, the, main, steppe, by, the, mountains, of, transylvania, on, the, north, shore, of, the, black, sea, the, crimean, peninsula, has, some, interior, steppe, and, ports, on, the, south, coast, which, link, the, steppe, to, the, civilizations, of, the, mediterranean, basin, the, steppe, narrows, around, the, southern, end, of, the, ural, mountains, about, 650, km, 400, mi, northeast, of, the, caspian, sea, forming, the, ural, caspian, narrowing, that, joins, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, in, europe, with, the, kazakh, steppe, in, central, asia, the, kazakh, steppe, makes, up, most, of, the, eurasian, steppe, in, central, asia, it, extends, from, the, urals, to, dzungaria, to, the, south, it, grades, off, into, semi, desert, and, desert, which, is, interrupted, by, two, great, rivers, the, amu, darya, oxus, and, syr, darya, jaxartes, which, flow, northwest, into, the, aral, sea, and, provide, irrigation, for, agriculture, in, the, southeast, is, the, densely, populated, fergana, valley, and, west, of, it, the, great, oasis, cities, of, tashkent, samarkand, and, bukhara, along, the, zeravshan, river, the, southern, area, has, a, complex, history, see, central, asia, and, greater, iran, while, in, the, north, the, kazakh, steppe, proper, was, relatively, isolated, from, the, main, currents, of, written, history, along, the, former, sino, soviet, border, mountains, extend, north, almost, to, the, forest, zone, separating, the, central, steppe, from, the, eastern, steppe, leaving, only, limited, grassland, in, dzungaria, this, discontinuous, section, of, the, eurasian, steppe, connects, the, great, steppes, of, central, asia, and, east, asia, the, east, west, tian, shan, mountains, divide, the, steppe, into, dzungaria, in, the, north, and, the, tarim, basin, to, the, south, dzungaria, is, bounded, by, the, tarbagatai, mountains, on, the, west, and, the, mongolian, altai, mountains, on, the, east, neither, of, which, is, a, significant, barrier, dzungaria, has, good, grassland, around, the, edges, and, a, central, desert, it, often, behaved, as, a, westward, extension, of, mongolia, and, connected, mongolia, to, the, kazakh, steppe, to, the, north, of, dzungaria, are, mountains, and, the, siberian, forest, to, the, south, and, west, of, dzungaria, and, separated, from, it, by, the, tian, shan, mountains, is, an, area, about, twice, the, size, of, dzungaria, the, oval, tarim, basin, the, tarim, basin, s, arid, conditions, make, it, unsuitable, for, sustaining, a, nomadic, population, however, along, its, periphery, rivers, descend, from, the, mountains, creating, a, circle, of, cities, that, thrived, on, irrigation, agriculture, and, engaged, in, east, west, trade, the, tarim, basin, formed, an, island, of, near, civilization, in, the, center, of, the, steppe, the, northern, silk, road, went, along, the, north, and, south, sides, of, the, tarim, basin, and, then, crossed, the, mountains, west, to, the, fergana, valley, at, the, west, end, of, the, basin, the, pamir, mountains, connect, the, tian, shan, mountains, to, the, himalayas, to, the, south, the, kunlun, mountains, separate, the, tarim, basin, from, the, thinly, peopled, tibetan, plateau, the, mongolian, manchurian, steppe, is, the, main, part, of, the, eurasian, steppe, in, east, asia, it, covers, large, parts, of, mongolia, and, the, chinese, province, of, inner, mongolia, the, two, are, separated, by, a, relatively, dry, area, marked, by, the, gobi, desert, south, of, the, mongol, steppe, is, the, high, and, thinly, peopled, tibetan, plateau, the, northern, edge, of, the, plateau, is, the, gansu, or, hexi, corridor, a, belt, of, moderately, dense, population, that, connects, china, proper, with, the, tarim, basin, the, hexi, corridor, was, the, main, route, of, the, silk, road, in, the, southeast, the, silk, road, led, over, some, hills, to, the, east, flowing, wei, river, valley, which, led, to, the, north, china, plain, south, of, the, khingan, mountains, and, north, of, the, taihang, mountains, the, mongolian, manchurian, steppe, extends, east, into, manchuria, as, the, liao, xi, steppe, in, manchuria, the, steppe, grades, off, into, forest, and, mountains, without, reaching, the, pacific, the, central, area, of, forest, steppe, was, inhabited, by, pastoral, and, agricultural, peoples, while, to, the, north, and, east, was, a, thin, population, of, hunting, tribes, of, the, siberian, type, big, mammals, of, the, eurasian, steppe, were, the, przewalski, s, horse, the, saiga, antelope, the, mongolian, gazelle, the, goitered, gazelle, the, wild, bactrian, camel, and, the, onager, the, gray, wolf, corsac, fox, pallas, s, cat, and, occasionally, the, brown, bear, are, predators, roaming, the, steppe, smaller, mammal, species, are, the, mongolian, gerbil, the, little, souslik, and, the, bobak, marmot, furthermore, the, eurasian, steppe, is, home, to, a, great, variety, of, bird, species, threatened, bird, species, living, there, are, for, example, the, imperial, eagle, the, lesser, kestrel, the, great, bustard, the, pale, back, pigeon, and, the, white, throated, bushchat, the, primary, domesticated, animals, raised, were, sheep, and, goats, with, fewer, cattle, than, one, might, expect, camels, were, used, in, the, drier, areas, for, transport, as, far, west, as, astrakhan, there, were, some, yaks, along, the, edge, of, tibet, the, horse, was, used, for, transportation, and, warfare, the, horse, was, first, domesticated, on, the, pontic, caspian, or, kazakh, steppe, sometime, before, 3000, bc, but, it, took, a, long, time, for, mounted, archery, to, develop, and, the, process, is, not, fully, understood, the, stirrup, does, not, seem, to, have, been, completely, developed, until, 300, ad, see, stirrup, saddle, composite, bow, domestication, of, the, horse, and, related, articles, parts, of, the, eurasian, steppe, experience, an, ecological, regime, shift, in, form, of, woody, plant, encroachment, such, as, the, black, sea, kazakhstan, steppe, the, tibetan, plateau, steppe, and, the, central, asian, steppe, this, process, involves, the, gradual, increase, of, shrubs, at, the, expense, of, grasses, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, divides, the, eurasian, steppe, s, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, into, a, number, of, ecoregions, distinguished, by, elevation, climate, rainfall, and, other, characteristics, and, home, to, distinct, animal, and, plant, communities, and, species, and, distinct, habitat, ecosystems, the, major, centers, of, population, and, high, culture, in, eurasia, are, europe, the, middle, east, india, and, china, for, some, purposes, it, is, useful, to, treat, greater, iran, as, a, separate, region, all, these, regions, are, connected, directly, or, indirectly, by, the, eurasian, steppe, route, which, was, an, active, predecessor, of, the, silk, road, the, latter, started, in, the, guanzhong, region, of, china, and, ran, west, along, the, hexi, corridor, to, the, tarim, basin, from, there, it, went, southwest, to, greater, iran, and, turned, southeast, to, india, or, west, to, the, middle, east, and, europe, a, minor, branch, went, northwest, along, the, great, rivers, and, north, of, the, caspian, sea, to, the, black, sea, when, faced, with, a, rich, caravan, the, steppe, nomads, could, either, rob, it, or, tax, it, or, hire, themselves, out, as, guards, economically, these, three, forms, of, taxation, or, parasitism, amounted, to, the, same, thing, trade, was, usually, most, vigorous, when, a, strong, empire, controlled, the, steppe, and, reduced, the, number, of, petty, chieftains, preying, on, trade, the, silk, road, first, became, significant, and, chinese, silk, began, reaching, the, roman, empire, about, the, time, that, the, emperor, of, han, pushed, chinese, power, west, to, the, tarim, basin, the, nomads, would, occasionally, tolerate, colonies, of, peasants, on, the, steppe, in, the, few, areas, where, farming, was, possible, these, were, often, captives, who, grew, grain, for, their, nomadic, masters, along, the, fringes, there, were, areas, that, could, be, used, for, either, plowland, or, grassland, these, alternated, between, one, and, the, other, depending, on, the, relative, strength, of, the, nomadic, and, agrarian, heartlands, over, the, last, few, hundred, years, the, russian, steppe, and, much, of, inner, mongolia, has, been, cultivated, the, fact, that, most, of, the, russian, steppe, is, not, irrigated, implies, that, it, was, maintained, as, grasslands, as, a, result, of, the, military, strength, of, the, nomads, according, to, the, most, widely, held, hypothesis, of, the, origin, of, the, indo, european, languages, the, kurgan, hypothesis, their, common, ancestor, is, thought, to, have, originated, on, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, the, tocharians, were, an, early, indo, european, branch, in, the, tarim, basin, at, the, beginning, of, written, history, the, entire, steppe, population, west, of, dzungaria, spoke, iranian, languages, from, about, 500, ad, the, turkic, languages, replaced, the, iranian, languages, first, on, the, steppe, and, later, in, the, oases, north, of, iran, additionally, hungarian, speakers, a, branch, of, the, uralic, language, family, who, previously, lived, in, the, steppe, in, what, is, now, southern, russia, settled, in, the, carpathian, basin, in, year, 895, mongolic, languages, are, in, mongolia, in, manchuria, one, finds, tungusic, languages, and, some, others, tengrism, was, introduced, by, turko, mongol, nomads, nestorianism, and, manichaeism, spread, to, the, tarim, basin, and, into, china, but, they, never, became, established, majority, religions, buddhism, spread, from, the, east, of, india, to, the, tarim, basin, and, found, a, new, home, in, china, by, about, 1400, ad, the, entire, steppe, west, of, dzungaria, had, adopted, islam, by, about, 1600, ad, islam, was, established, in, the, tarim, basin, while, dzungaria, and, mongolia, had, adopted, tibetan, buddhism, raids, between, tribes, were, prevalent, throughout, the, region, s, history, this, relates, to, the, ease, with, which, a, defeated, enemy, s, flocks, and, herds, can, be, driven, away, making, raiding, profitable, in, terms, of, warfare, and, raiding, in, relation, to, sedentary, societies, the, horse, gave, the, nomads, an, advantage, of, mobility, horsemen, could, raid, a, village, and, retreat, with, their, loot, before, an, infantry, based, army, could, be, mustered, and, deployed, when, confronted, with, superior, infantry, horsemen, could, simply, ride, away, retreat, and, regroup, outside, of, europe, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, agrarian, societies, had, difficulty, raising, a, sufficient, supply, of, war, horses, and, often, had, to, enlist, cavalry, from, their, nomadic, enemies, as, mercenaries, nomads, could, not, easily, be, pursued, onto, the, steppe, since, the, steppe, could, not, easily, support, a, land, army, if, the, chinese, sent, an, army, into, mongolia, the, nomads, would, flee, and, come, back, when, the, chinese, ran, out, of, supplies, but, the, steppe, nomads, were, relatively, few, and, their, rulers, had, difficulty, holding, together, enough, clans, and, tribes, to, field, a, large, army, if, steppe, nomads, conquered, an, agricultural, area, they, often, lacked, the, skills, to, administer, it, if, they, tried, to, hold, agrarian, land, they, gradually, absorbed, the, civilization, of, their, subjects, lost, their, nomadic, skills, and, were, either, assimilated, or, driven, out, along, the, northern, fringe, of, the, eurasian, steppe, nomads, would, collect, tribute, from, and, blend, with, the, forest, tribes, see, khanate, of, sibir, buryats, russia, paid, tribute, compare, yasak, to, the, golden, horde, from, about, 1240, to, 1480, south, of, the, kazakh, steppe, the, nomads, blended, with, the, sedentary, population, partly, because, the, middle, east, has, significant, areas, of, steppe, taken, by, force, in, past, invasions, and, pastoralism, there, was, a, sharp, cultural, divide, between, mongolia, and, china, and, almost, constant, warfare, from, the, dawn, of, history, until, the, qing, conquest, of, dzungaria, in, 1757, the, nomads, collected, large, amounts, of, tribute, from, the, chinese, and, several, chinese, dynasties, were, of, steppe, origin, perhaps, because, of, the, mixture, of, agriculture, and, pastoralism, in, manchuria, its, inhabitants, the, manchu, knew, how, to, deal, with, both, nomads, and, the, settled, populations, and, therefore, were, able, to, conquer, much, of, northern, china, when, both, chinese, and, mongols, were, weak, the, steppe, culture, of, russia, was, shaped, in, russia, through, cross, cultural, contact, mostly, by, slavic, tatar, turkic, mongolian, and, iranian, people, rus, rulers, would, ally, themselves, by, marriage, with, fellow, steppe, peoples, in, addition, to, ethnicity, also, instruments, such, as, the, domra, traditional, costumes, such, as, the, kaftan, russian, cossack, and, tea, culture, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, culture, of, asian, nomadic, peoples, the, eurasian, steppes, play, a, major, role, in, eastern, europe, history, and, the, steppes, are, a, subject, of, many, slavic, as, well, as, russian, folk, songs
