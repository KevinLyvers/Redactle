the, pyrenees, are, a, mountain, range, straddling, the, border, of, france, and, spain, they, extend, nearly, 500, km, 310, mi, from, their, union, with, the, cantabrian, mountains, to, cap, de, creus, on, the, mediterranean, coast, reaching, a, maximum, altitude, of, 3, 404, metres, 11, 168, ft, at, the, peak, of, aneto, for, the, most, part, the, main, crest, forms, a, divide, between, spain, and, france, with, the, microstate, of, andorra, sandwiched, in, between, historically, the, crown, of, aragon, and, the, kingdom, of, navarre, extended, on, both, sides, of, the, mountain, range, in, greek, mythology, pyrene, is, a, princess, who, gave, her, name, to, the, pyrenees, the, greek, historian, herodotus, says, pyrene, is, the, name, of, a, town, in, celtic, europe, according, to, silius, italicus, she, was, the, virgin, daughter, of, bebryx, a, king, in, mediterranean, gaul, by, whom, the, hero, hercules, was, given, hospitality, during, his, quest, to, steal, the, cattle, of, geryon, during, his, famous, labours, hercules, characteristically, drunk, and, lustful, violates, the, sacred, code, of, hospitality, and, rapes, his, host, s, daughter, pyrene, gives, birth, to, a, serpent, and, runs, away, to, the, woods, afraid, that, her, father, will, be, angry, alone, she, pours, out, her, story, to, the, trees, attracting, the, attention, of, wild, beasts, who, tear, her, to, pieces, after, his, victory, over, geryon, hercules, passes, through, the, kingdom, of, bebryx, again, finding, the, girl, s, lacerated, remains, as, is, often, the, case, in, stories, of, this, hero, the, sober, hercules, responds, with, heartbroken, grief, and, remorse, at, the, actions, of, his, darker, self, and, lays, pyrene, to, rest, tenderly, demanding, that, the, surrounding, geography, join, in, mourning, and, preserve, her, name, struck, by, herculean, voice, the, mountaintops, shudder, at, the, ridges, he, kept, crying, out, with, a, sorrowful, noise, pyrene, and, all, the, rock, cliffs, and, wild, beast, haunts, echo, back, pyrene, the, mountains, hold, on, to, the, wept, over, name, through, the, ages, pliny, the, elder, connects, the, story, of, hercules, and, pyrene, to, lusitania, but, rejects, it, as, fabulosa, highly, fictional, other, classical, sources, derived, the, name, from, the, greek, word, for, fire, ancient, greek, ipa, p, r, according, to, greek, historian, diodorus, siculus, in, ancient, times, we, are, told, certain, herdsmen, left, a, fire, and, the, whole, area, of, the, mountains, was, entirely, consumed, and, due, to, this, fire, since, it, raged, continuously, day, after, day, the, surface, of, the, earth, was, also, burned, and, the, mountains, because, of, what, had, taken, place, were, called, the, pyrenees, the, spanish, pyrenees, are, part, of, the, following, provinces, from, east, to, west, girona, barcelona, lleida, all, in, catalonia, huesca, in, aragon, navarra, in, navarre, the, french, pyrenees, are, part, of, the, following, d, partements, from, east, to, west, pyr, n, es, orientales, also, known, as, northern, catalonia, aude, ari, ge, haute, garonne, hautes, pyr, n, es, and, pyr, n, es, atlantiques, the, latter, two, of, which, include, the, pyrenees, national, park, the, independent, principality, of, andorra, is, sandwiched, in, the, eastern, portion, of, the, mountain, range, between, the, spanish, pyrenees, and, french, pyrenees, physiographically, the, pyrenees, may, be, divided, into, three, sections, the, atlantic, or, western, the, central, and, the, eastern, pyrenees, together, they, form, a, distinct, physiographic, province, of, the, larger, alpine, system, division, in, the, western, pyrenees, from, the, basque, mountains, near, the, bay, of, biscay, of, the, atlantic, ocean, the, average, elevation, gradually, increases, from, west, to, east, the, central, pyrenees, extend, eastward, from, the, somport, pass, to, the, aran, valley, and, they, include, the, highest, summits, of, this, range, in, the, eastern, pyrenees, with, the, exception, of, one, break, at, the, eastern, extremity, of, the, pyr, n, es, ari, geoises, in, the, ari, ge, area, the, mean, elevation, is, remarkably, uniform, until, a, sudden, decline, occurs, in, the, easternmost, portion, of, the, chain, known, as, the, alb, res, most, foothills, of, the, pyrenees, are, on, the, spanish, side, where, there, is, a, large, and, complex, system, of, ranges, stretching, from, spanish, navarre, across, northern, aragon, and, into, catalonia, almost, reaching, the, mediterranean, coast, with, summits, reaching, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, at, the, eastern, end, on, the, southern, side, lies, a, distinct, area, known, as, the, sub, pyrenees, on, the, french, side, the, slopes, of, the, main, range, descend, abruptly, and, there, are, no, foothills, except, in, the, corbi, res, massif, in, the, northeastern, corner, of, the, mountain, system, the, pyrenees, are, older, than, the, alps, their, sediments, were, first, deposited, in, coastal, basins, during, the, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, eras, during, ediacaran, to, ordovician, times, pyrenees, were, located, at, the, northwest, margin, of, gondwana, where, they, formed, a, lateral, continuity, of, neighbouring, areas, such, as, the, montagne, noire, and, the, mouthoumet, massifs, and, southwestern, territory, of, sardinia, between, 100, and, 150, million, years, ago, during, the, early, cretaceous, period, the, bay, of, biscay, fanned, out, pushing, present, day, spain, against, france, and, applying, intense, compressional, pressure, to, large, layers, of, sedimentary, rock, the, intense, pressure, and, uplifting, of, the, earth, s, crust, first, affected, the, eastern, part, and, moved, progressively, to, the, entire, chain, culminating, in, the, eocene, epoch, the, eastern, part, of, the, pyrenees, consists, largely, of, granite, and, gneissose, rocks, while, in, the, western, part, the, granite, peaks, are, flanked, by, layers, of, limestone, the, massive, and, unworn, character, of, the, chain, comes, from, its, abundance, of, granite, which, is, particularly, resistant, to, erosion, as, well, as, weak, glacial, development, the, upper, parts, of, the, pyrenees, contain, low, relief, surfaces, forming, a, peneplain, this, peneplain, originated, no, earlier, than, in, late, miocene, times, presumably, it, formed, at, height, as, extensive, sedimentation, raised, the, local, base, level, considerably, conspicuous, features, of, pyrenean, scenery, are, the, highest, waterfall, is, gavarnie, 462, m, or, 1, 515, ft, at, the, head, of, the, gave, de, pau, the, cirque, de, gavarnie, in, the, same, valley, together, with, the, nearby, cirque, de, troumouse, and, cirque, d, estaub, are, notable, examples, of, the, cirque, formation, low, passes, are, lacking, and, the, principal, roads, and, the, railroads, between, france, and, spain, run, only, in, the, lowlands, at, the, western, and, eastern, ends, of, the, pyrenees, near, sea, level, the, main, passes, of, note, are, because, of, the, lack, of, low, passes, a, number, of, tunnels, have, been, created, beneath, the, passes, at, somport, envalira, and, puymorens, and, new, routes, in, the, center, of, the, range, at, bielsa, and, vielha, a, notable, visual, feature, of, this, mountain, range, is, la, br, che, de, roland, a, gap, in, the, ridge, line, which, according, to, legend, was, created, by, roland, the, metallic, ores, of, the, pyrenees, are, not, in, general, of, much, importance, now, though, there, were, iron, mines, at, several, locations, in, andorra, as, well, as, at, vicdessos, in, ari, ge, and, the, foot, of, canigou, in, pyr, n, es, orientales, long, ago, coal, deposits, capable, of, being, profitably, worked, are, situated, chiefly, on, the, spanish, slopes, but, the, french, side, has, beds, of, lignite, the, open, pit, of, trimoun, near, the, commune, of, luzenac, ari, ge, is, one, of, the, greatest, sources, of, talc, in, europe, there, are, many, marble, quarries, in, the, pyrenees, most, of, which, were, opened, by, the, romans, in, ancient, times, quarried, intermittently, they, provided, prestigious, marbles, such, as, grand, antique, used, in, rome, and, constantinople, by, the, romans, statuary, white, marbles, as, well, as, coloured, marbles, used, to, decorate, the, royal, palaces, of, the, louvre, and, versailles, in, france, and, the, royal, palace, of, madrid, in, spain, mineral, springs, are, abundant, and, remarkable, and, especially, noteworthy, are, the, hot, springs, the, hot, springs, among, which, those, of, les, escaldes, in, andorra, panticosa, and, lles, in, spain, ax, les, thermes, bagn, res, de, luchon, and, eaux, chaudes, in, france, may, be, mentioned, are, sulfurous, and, mostly, situated, high, near, the, contact, of, the, granite, with, the, stratified, rocks, the, lower, springs, such, as, those, of, bagn, res, de, bigorre, hautes, pyr, n, es, rennes, les, bains, aude, and, campagne, sur, aude, aude, are, mostly, selenitic, and, not, hot, the, amount, of, precipitation, the, range, receives, including, rain, and, snow, is, much, greater, in, the, western, than, in, the, eastern, pyrenees, because, of, the, moist, air, that, blows, in, from, the, atlantic, ocean, over, the, bay, of, biscay, after, dropping, its, moisture, over, the, western, and, central, pyrenees, the, air, is, left, dry, over, the, eastern, pyrenees, the, winter, average, temperature, is, 2, c, 28, f, sections, of, the, mountain, range, vary, in, more, than, one, respect, there, are, some, glaciers, in, the, western, and, snowy, central, pyrenees, but, there, are, no, glaciers, in, the, eastern, pyrenees, because, there, is, insufficient, snowfall, to, cause, their, development, glaciers, are, confined, to, the, northern, slopes, of, the, central, pyrenees, and, do, not, descend, like, those, of, the, alps, far, down, into, the, valleys, but, rather, have, their, greatest, lengths, along, the, direction, of, the, mountain, chain, they, form, in, fact, in, a, narrow, zone, near, the, crest, of, the, highest, mountains, here, as, in, the, other, great, mountain, ranges, of, central, europe, there, is, substantial, evidence, of, a, much, wider, expanse, of, glaciation, during, the, glacial, periods, the, best, evidence, of, this, is, in, the, valley, of, argeles, gazost, between, lourdes, and, gavarnie, in, the, d, partement, of, hautes, pyr, n, es, the, annual, snow, line, varies, in, different, parts, of, the, pyrenees, from, about, 2, 700, to, 2, 800, metres, 8, 900, to, 9, 200, ft, above, sea, level, in, average, the, seasonal, snow, is, observed, at, least, 50, of, the, time, above, 1, 600, metres, 5, 200, ft, between, december, and, april, a, still, more, marked, effect, of, the, preponderance, of, rainfall, in, the, western, half, of, the, chain, is, seen, in, the, vegetation, the, lower, mountains, in, the, extreme, west, are, wooded, but, the, extent, of, forest, declines, as, one, moves, eastwards, the, eastern, pyrenees, are, peculiarly, wild, and, barren, all, the, more, since, it, is, in, this, part, of, the, chain, that, granitic, masses, prevail, also, moving, from, west, to, east, there, is, a, change, in, the, composition, of, the, flora, with, the, change, becoming, most, evident, as, one, passes, the, centre, of, the, mountain, chain, from, which, point, the, corbi, res, massif, stretch, north, eastwards, towards, the, central, plateau, of, france, though, the, difference, in, latitude, is, only, about, 1, in, the, west, the, flora, resembles, that, of, central, europe, while, in, the, east, it, is, distinctly, mediterranean, in, character, the, pyrenees, are, nearly, as, rich, in, endemic, species, as, the, alps, and, among, the, most, remarkable, instances, of, that, endemism, is, the, occurrence, of, the, monotypic, genus, xatardia, family, apiaceae, which, grows, only, on, a, high, alpine, pass, between, the, val, d, eynes, and, catalonia, other, examples, include, arenaria, montana, bulbocodium, vernum, and, ranunculus, glacialis, the, genus, most, abundantly, represented, in, the, range, is, that, of, the, saxifrages, several, species, of, which, are, endemic, here, in, their, fauna, the, pyrenees, present, some, striking, instances, of, endemism, the, pyrenean, desman, is, found, only, in, some, of, the, streams, of, the, northern, slopes, of, these, mountains, the, only, other, desman, the, russian, desman, is, confined, to, the, volga, river, basin, in, southern, russia, kazakhstan, and, ukraine, the, pyrenean, brook, salamander, calotriton, asper, an, endemic, amphibian, also, lives, in, streams, and, lakes, located, at, high, altitudes, among, other, peculiarities, of, pyrenean, fauna, are, blind, insects, in, the, caverns, of, ari, ge, the, principal, genera, of, which, are, anophthalmus, and, adelops, the, pyrenean, ibex, an, endemic, subspecies, of, the, iberian, ibex, became, extinct, in, january, 2000, another, subspecies, the, western, spanish, ibex, was, introduced, into, the, area, with, the, population, numbering, over, 400, individuals, as, of, 2020, the, native, brown, bear, population, was, hunted, to, near, extinction, in, the, 1990s, but, its, numbers, rebounded, in, 1996, when, three, bears, were, brought, from, slovenia, the, bear, population, has, bred, successfully, and, there, are, now, believed, to, be, about, 15, brown, bears, in, the, central, region, around, fos, with, only, four, native, ones, still, living, in, the, aspe, valley, principal, nature, reserves, and, national, parks, in, 1997, part, of, the, pyrenees, including, ordesa, y, monte, perdido, national, park, and, pyrenees, national, park, was, inscribed, on, the, unesco, world, heritage, list, for, its, spectacular, geologic, landforms, and, testimony, to, the, unique, transhumance, agricultural, system, the, pyrenean, region, possesses, a, varied, ethnology, folklore, and, history, see, andorra, aragon, ari, ge, basque, country, b, arn, catalonia, navarre, roussillon, for, their, history, see, also, almogavars, marca, hispanica, the, principal, languages, spoken, in, the, area, are, spanish, french, aragonese, catalan, in, andorra, and, in, northern, and, southern, catalonia, and, basque, also, spoken, to, a, lesser, degree, is, the, occitan, language, consisting, of, the, gascon, and, languedocien, dialects, in, france, and, the, aranese, dialect, in, the, aran, valley, an, important, feature, of, rural, life, in, the, pyrenees, is, transhumance, the, moving, of, livestock, from, the, farms, in, the, valleys, up, to, the, higher, grounds, of, the, mountains, for, the, summer, in, this, way, the, farming, communities, could, keep, larger, herds, than, the, lowland, farms, could, support, on, their, own, the, principal, animals, moved, were, cows, and, sheep, but, historically, most, members, of, farming, families, also, moved, to, the, higher, pastures, along, with, their, animals, so, they, also, took, with, them, pigs, horses, and, chickens, transhumance, thus, took, the, form, of, a, mass, biannual, migration, moving, uphill, in, may, or, june, and, returning, to, the, farms, in, september, or, october, during, the, summer, period, the, families, would, live, in, basic, stone, cabins, in, the, high, mountains, nowadays, industrialisation, and, changing, agriculture, practices, have, diminished, the, custom, however, the, importance, of, transhumance, continues, to, be, recognised, through, its, celebration, in, popular, festivals, the, pic, du, midi, observatory, is, an, astronomical, observatory, located, at, 2877, metres, on, top, of, the, pic, du, midi, de, bigorre, in, the, french, pyrenees, construction, of, the, observatory, began, in, 1878, and, the, 8, metre, dome, was, completed, in, 1908, the, observatory, housed, a, powerful, mechanical, equatorial, reflector, which, was, used, in, 1909, to, formally, discredit, the, martian, canal, theory, a, 1, 06, metre, 42, in, telescope, was, installed, in, 1963, funded, by, nasa, and, was, used, to, take, detailed, photographs, of, the, surface, of, the, moon, in, preparation, for, the, apollo, missions, other, studies, conducted, in, 1965, provided, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, composition, of, the, atmospheres, on, mars, and, venus, this, served, as, a, basis, for, jet, propulsion, laboratory, scientists, to, predict, that, these, planets, had, no, life, since, 1980, the, observatory, has, had, a, 2, metre, telescope, which, is, the, largest, telescope, in, france, overtaken, by, the, giant, telescopes, built, in, recent, decades, today, the, observatory, is, widely, open, to, amateur, astronomy, the, odeillo, solar, furnace, is, the, world, s, largest, solar, furnace, it, is, situated, in, font, romeu, odeillo, via, in, the, department, of, pyr, n, es, orientales, in, south, of, france, built, between, 1962, and, 1968, it, is, 54, metres, 177, ft, and, 48, metres, 157, ft, wide, and, includes, 63, heliostats, the, site, was, chosen, because, of, the, length, and, the, quality, of, sunshine, with, direct, light, more, than, 2, 500, h, year, and, the, purity, of, its, atmosphere, high, altitude, and, low, average, humidity, this, furnace, serves, as, a, science, research, site, studying, materials, at, very, high, temperatures, temperatures, above, 3, 500, c, 6, 330, f, can, be, obtained, in, a, few, seconds, in, addition, it, provides, rapid, temperature, changes, and, therefore, allows, studying, the, effect, of, thermal, shocks, no, big, cities, are, in, the, range, itself, the, largest, urban, area, close, to, the, pyrenees, is, toulouse, haute, garonne, france, with, a, population, of, 1, 330, 954, in, its, metropolitan, area, on, the, spanish, side, pamplona, navarre, is, the, closest, city, with, a, population, of, 319, 208, in, its, metropolitan, area, inside, the, pyrenees, the, main, towns, are, andorra, la, vella, 22, 256, and, escaldes, engordany, 14, 367, in, andorra, jaca, 12, 813, and, la, seu, d, urgell, 12, 252, in, spain, and, lourdes, 13, 976, and, foix, 10, 046, in, france, the, following, is, the, complete, list, of, the, summits, of, the, pyrenees, above, 3, 000, metres, both, sides, of, the, pyrenees, are, popular, spots, for, winter, sports, such, as, alpine, skiing, and, mountaineering, the, pyrenees, are, also, a, good, place, for, athletes, to, do, high, altitude, training, in, the, summertime, such, as, by, bicycling, and, cross, country, running, in, the, summer, and, the, autumn, the, pyrenees, are, usually, featured, in, two, of, cycling, s, grand, tours, the, tour, de, france, held, annually, in, july, and, the, vuelta, a, espa, a, held, in, september, the, stages, held, in, the, pyrenees, are, often, crucial, legs, of, both, tours, drawing, hundreds, of, thousands, of, spectators, to, the, region, three, main, long, distance, footpaths, run, the, length, of, the, mountain, range, the, gr, 10, across, the, northern, slopes, the, gr, 11, across, the, southern, slopes, and, the, hrp, which, traverses, peaks, and, ridges, along, a, high, altitude, route, in, addition, there, are, numerous, marked, and, unmarked, trails, throughout, the, region, pirena, is, a, dog, mushing, competition, held, in, the, pyrenees, ski, resorts, in, the, pyrenees, include
