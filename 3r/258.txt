prehistoric, times, the, islands, were, uninhabited, when, europeans, first, explored, them, european, claims, of, discovery, date, back, to, the, 16th, century, but, no, consensus, exists, on, whether, early, explorers, sighted, the, falklands, or, other, islands, in, the, south, atlantic, the, first, undisputed, landing, on, the, islands, is, attributed, to, english, captain, john, strong, who, en, route, to, peru, and, chile, s, littoral, in, 1690, explored, the, falkland, sound, and, noted, the, islands, water, and, game, the, falklands, remained, uninhabited, until, the, 1764, establishment, of, port, louis, on, east, falkland, by, french, captain, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, and, the, 1765, foundation, of, port, egmont, on, saunders, island, by, captain, john, byron,

detected, and, captured, port, egmont, in, 1770, war, was, narrowly, avoided, by, its, restitution, to, britain, in, 1771, the, british, and, spanish, settlements, coexisted, in, the, archipelago, until, 1774, when, britain, s, new, economic, and, strategic, considerations, led, it, to, withdraw, the, garrison, from, the, islands, leaving, a, plaque, claiming, the, falklands, for, king, george, iii, spain, s, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, became, the, only, formal, presence, in, the, territory, west, falkland, was, left, abandoned, and, puerto, soledad, became, a, penal, colony,

garrison, followed, suit, in, 1811, except, for, gauchos, and, fishermen, who, remained, voluntarily, thereafter, the, archipelago, was, visited, only, by, fishing, ships, its, political, status, was, undisputed, until, 1820, when, colonel, david, jewett, an, american, privateer, working, for, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, informed, anchored, ships, about, buenos, aires, 1816, claim, to, spain, s, territories, in, the, south, atlantic, since, the, islands, had, no, permanent, inhabitants, in, 1823, buenos, aires, granted, german, born, merchant, luis, vernet, permission, to, conduct, fishing, activities, and, exploit, feral, cattle, in, the, archipelago, vernet, settled, at, the, ruins, of, puerto, soledad, in, 1826, and, accumulated, resources, on, the, islands, until, the, venture, was, secure, enough, to, bring, settlers, and, form, a, permanent, colony, buenos, aires, named, vernet, military, and, civil, commander, of, the, islands, in, 1829, and, he, attempted, to, regulate, sealing, to, stop, the, activities, of, foreign, whalers, and, sealers, vernet, s, venture, lasted, until, a, dispute, related, to, fishing, and, hunting, rights, led, to, a, raid, by, the, american, warship, uss, lexington, in, 1831, when, united, states, navy, commander, silas, duncan, declared, the, dissolution, of, the, island, s, government, buenos, aires, attempted, to, gain, influence, over, the, settlement, by, installing, a, garrison, in, october, 1832, which, mutinied, within, a, month, and, was, followed, the, next, year, by, the, arrival, of, british, forces, who, reasserted, britain, s, rule, the, argentine, confederation, headed, by, buenos, aires, governor, juan, manuel, de, rosas, protested, against, britain, s, actions, and, argentine, governments, have, continued, since, then, to, register, official, protests, against, britain, the, british, troops, departed, after, completing, their, mission, leaving, the, area, without, formal, government, vernet, s, deputy, the, scotsman, matthew, brisbane, returned, to, the, islands, that, year, to, restore, the, business, but, his, efforts, ended, after, amid, unrest, at, port, louis, gaucho, antonio, rivero, led, a, group, of, dissatisfied, individuals, to, murder, brisbane, and, the, settlement, s, senior, leaders, survivors, hid, in, a, cave, on, a, nearby, island, until, the, british, returned, and, restored, order, in, 1840, the, falklands, became, a, crown, colony, and, scottish, settlers, subsequently, established, an, official, pastoral, community, four, years, later, nearly, everyone, relocated, to, port, jackson, considered, a, better, location, for, the, government, and, merchant, samuel, lafone, began, a, venture, to, encourage, british, colonisation, stanley, as, port, jackson, was, soon, renamed, officially, became, the, seat, of, government, in, 1845, early, in, its, history, stanley, had, a, negative, reputation, due, to, cargo, shipping, losses, only, in, emergencies, would, ships, rounding, cape, horn, stop, at, the, port, nevertheless, the, falklands, geographic, location, proved, ideal, for, ship, repairs, and, the, wrecking, trade, the, business, of, selling, and, buying, shipwrecks, and, their, cargoes, aside, from, this, trade, commercial, interest, in, the, archipelago, was, minimal, due, to, the, low, value, hides, of, the, feral, cattle, roaming, the, pastures, economic, growth, began, only, after, the, falkland, islands, company, which, bought, out, lafone, s, failing, enterprise, in, 1851, successfully, introduced, cheviot, sheep, for, wool, farming, spurring, other, farms, to, follow, suit, the, high, cost, of, importing, materials, combined, with, the, shortage, of, labour, and, consequent, high, wages, meant, the, ship, repair, trade, became, uncompetitive, after, 1870, it, declined, as, the, replacement, of, sail, ships, by, steamships, was, accelerated, by, the, low, cost, of, coal, in, south, america, by, 1914, with, the, opening, of, the, panama, canal, the, trade, effectively, ended, in, 1881, the, falkland, islands, became, financially, independent, of, britain, for, more, than, a, century, the, falkland, islands, company, dominated, the, trade, and, employment, of, the, archipelago, in, addition, it, owned, most, housing, in, stanley, which, greatly, benefited, from, the, wool, trade, with, the, uk, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, falklands, served, an, important, role, in, britain, s, territorial, claims, to, subantarctic,

japanese, seizure, of, the, archipelago, after, the, war, ended, the, falklands, economy, was, affected, by, declining, wool, prices, and, the, political, uncertainty, resulting, from, the, revived, sovereignty, dispute, between, the, united, kingdom, and, argentina, simmering, tensions, between, the, uk, and, argentina, increased, during, the, second, half, of, the, century, when, argentine, president, juan, per, n, asserted, sovereignty, over, the, archipelago, the, sovereignty, dispute, intensified, during, the, 1960s, shortly, after, the, united, nations, passed, a, resolution, on, decolonisation, which, argentina, interpreted, as, favourable, to, its, position, in, 1965, the, un, general, assembly, passed, resolution, 2065, calling, for, both, states, to, conduct, bilateral, negotiations, to, reach, a, peaceful, settlement, of, the, dispute, from, 1966, until, 1968, the, uk, confidentially, discussed, with, argentina, the, transfer, of, the, falklands, assuming, its, judgement, would, be, accepted, by, the, islanders, an, agreement, on, trade, ties, between, the, archipelago, and, the, mainland, was, reached, in, 1971, and, consequently, argentina, built, a, temporary, airfield, at, stanley, in, 1972, nonetheless, falklander, dissent, as, expressed, by, their, strong, lobby, in, the, uk, parliament, and, tensions, between, the, uk, and, argentina,

transferring, sovereignty, to, argentina, in, the, early, thatcher, government, substantive, sovereignty, talks, again, ended, by, 1981, and, the, dispute, escalated, with, passing, time, in, april, 1982, the, falklands, war, began, when, argentine, military, forces, invaded, the, falklands, and, other, british, territories, in, the, south, atlantic, briefly, occupying, them, until, a, uk,

the, war, also, left, some, 117, minefields, containing, nearly, 20, 000, mines, of, various, types, including, anti, vehicle, and, anti, personnel, mines, due, to, the, large, number, of, deminer,
