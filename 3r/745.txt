the, highlands, scots, the, hielands, scottish, gaelic, a, gh, idhealtachd, lit, the, place, of, the, gaels, is, a, historical, region, of, scotland, culturally, the, highlands, and, the, lowlands, diverged, from, the, late, middle, ages, into, the, modern, period, when, lowland, scots, language, replaced, scottish, gaelic, throughout, most, of, the, lowlands, the, term, is, also, used, for, the, area, north, and, west, of, the, highland, boundary, fault, although, the, exact, boundaries, are, not, clearly, defined, particularly, to, the, east, the, great, glen, divides, the, grampian, mountains, to, the, southeast, from, the, northwest, highlands, the, scottish, gaelic, name, of, a, gh, idhealtachd, literally, means, the, place, of, the, gaels, and, traditionally, from, a, gaelic, speaking, point, of, view, includes, both, the, western, isles, and, the, highlands, the, area, is, very, sparsely, populated, with, many, mountain, ranges, dominating, the, region, and, includes, the, highest, mountain, in, the, british, isles, ben, nevis, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, population, of, the, highlands, rose, to, around, 300, 000, but, from, c, 1841, and, for, the, next, 160, years, the, natural, increase, in, population, was, exceeded, by, emigration, mostly, to, canada, the, united, states, australia, and, new, zealand, and, migration, to, the, industrial, cities, of, scotland, and, england, xxiii, 414, and, passim, the, area, is, now, one, of, the, most, sparsely, populated, in, europe, at, 9, 1, km, 2, 24, sq, mi, in, 2012, the, population, density, in, the, highlands, and, islands, is, less, than, one, seventh, of, scotland, s, as, a, whole, the, highland, council, is, the, administrative, body, for, much, of, the, highlands, with, its, administrative, centre, at, inverness, however, the, highlands, also, includes, parts, of, the, council, areas, of, aberdeenshire, angus, argyll, and, bute, moray, north, ayrshire, perth, and, kinross, stirling, and, west, dunbartonshire, the, scottish, highlands, is, the, only, area, in, the, british, isles, to, have, the, taiga, biome, as, it, features, concentrated, populations, of, scots, pine, forest, see, caledonian, forest, it, is, the, most, mountainous, part, of, the, united, kingdom, between, the, 15th, century, and, the, mid, 20th, century, the, area, differed, from, most, of, the, lowlands, in, terms, of, language, in, scottish, gaelic, the, region, is, known, as, the, g, idhealtachd, because, it, was, traditionally, the, gaelic, speaking, part, of, scotland, although, the, language, is, now, largely, confined, to, the, hebrides, the, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, but, have, different, meanings, in, their, respective, languages, scottish, english, in, its, highland, form, is, the, predominant, language, of, the, area, today, though, highland, english, has, been, influenced, by, gaelic, speech, to, a, significant, extent, historically, the, highland, line, distinguished, the, two, scottish, cultures, while, the, highland, line, broadly, followed, the, geography, of, the, grampians, in, the, south, it, continued, in, the, north, cutting, off, the, north, eastern, areas, that, is, eastern, caithness, orkney, and, shetland, from, the, more, gaelic, highlands, and, hebrides, historically, the, major, social, unit, of, the, highlands, was, the, clan, scottish, kings, particularly, james, vi, saw, clans, as, a, challenge, to, their, authority, the, highlands, was, seen, by, many, as, a, lawless, region, the, scots, of, the, lowlands, viewed, the, highlanders, as, backward, and, more, irish, the, highlands, were, seen, as, the, overspill, of, gaelic, ireland, they, made, this, distinction, by, separating, germanic, scots, english, and, the, gaelic, by, renaming, it, erse, a, play, on, eire, following, the, union, of, the, crowns, james, vi, had, the, military, strength, to, back, up, any, attempts, to, impose, some, control, the, result, was, in, 1609, the, statutes, of, iona, which, started, the, process, of, integrating, clan, leaders, into, scottish, society, the, gradual, changes, continued, into, the, 19th, century, as, clan, chiefs, thought, of, themselves, less, as, patriarchal, leaders, of, their, people, and, more, as, commercial, landlords, the, first, effect, on, the, clansmen, who, were, their, tenants, was, the, change, to, rents, being, payable, in, money, rather, than, in, kind, later, rents, were, increased, as, highland, landowners, sought, to, increase, their, income, this, was, followed, mostly, in, the, period, 1760, 1850, by, agricultural, improvement, that, often, particularly, in, the, western, highlands, involved, clearance, of, the, population, to, make, way, for, large, scale, sheep, farms, displaced, tenants, were, set, up, in, crofting, communities, in, the, process, the, crofts, were, intended, not, to, provide, all, the, needs, of, their, occupiers, they, were, expected, to, work, in, other, industries, such, as, kelping, and, fishing, crofters, came, to, rely, substantially, on, seasonal, migrant, work, particularly, in, the, lowlands, this, gave, impetus, to, the, learning, of, english, which, was, seen, by, many, rural, gaelic, speakers, to, be, the, essential, language, of, work, 105, 07, 1, 17, 110, 18, 37, 46, 65, 73, 132, older, historiography, attributes, the, collapse, of, the, clan, system, to, the, aftermath, of, the, jacobite, risings, this, is, now, thought, less, influential, by, historians, following, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1745, the, british, government, enacted, a, series, of, laws, to, try, to, suppress, the, clan, system, including, bans, on, the, bearing, of, arms, and, the, wearing, of, tartan, and, limitations, on, the, activities, of, the, scottish, episcopal, church, most, of, this, legislation, was, repealed, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, as, the, jacobite, threat, subsided, there, was, soon, a, rehabilitation, of, highland, culture, tartan, was, adopted, for, highland, regiments, in, the, british, army, which, poor, highlanders, joined, in, large, numbers, in, the, era, of, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, 1790, 1815, tartan, had, largely, been, abandoned, by, the, ordinary, people, of, the, region, but, in, the, 1820s, tartan, and, the, kilt, were, adopted, by, members, of, the, social, elite, not, just, in, scotland, but, across, europe, the, international, craze, for, tartan, and, for, idealising, a, romanticised, highlands, was, set, off, by, the, ossian, cycle, and, further, popularised, by, the, works, of, walter, scott, his, staging, of, the, visit, of, king, george, iv, to, scotland, in, 1822, and, the, king, s, wearing, of, tartan, resulted, in, a, massive, upsurge, in, demand, for, kilts, and, tartans, that, could, not, be, met, by, the, scottish, woollen, industry, individual, clan, tartans, were, largely, designated, in, this, period, and, they, became, a, major, symbol, of, scottish, identity, this, highlandism, by, which, all, of, scotland, was, identified, with, the, culture, of, the, highlands, was, cemented, by, queen, victoria, s, interest, in, the, country, her, adoption, of, balmoral, as, a, major, royal, retreat, and, her, interest, in, tartenry, recurrent, famine, affected, the, highlands, for, much, of, its, history, with, significant, instances, as, late, as, 1817, in, the, eastern, highlands, and, the, early, 1850s, in, the, west, 415, 16, over, the, 18th, century, the, region, had, developed, a, trade, of, black, cattle, into, lowland, markets, and, this, was, balanced, by, imports, of, meal, into, the, area, there, was, a, critical, reliance, on, this, trade, to, provide, sufficient, food, and, it, is, seen, as, an, essential, prerequisite, for, the, population, growth, that, started, in, the, 18th, century, 48, 49, most, of, the, highlands, particularly, in, the, north, and, west, was, short, of, the, arable, land, that, was, essential, for, the, mixed, run, rig, based, communal, farming, that, existed, before, agricultural, improvement, was, introduced, into, the, region, between, the, 1760s, and, the, 1830s, there, was, a, substantial, trade, in, unlicensed, whisky, that, had, been, distilled, in, the, highlands, lowland, distillers, who, were, not, able, to, avoid, the, heavy, taxation, of, this, product, complained, that, highland, whisky, made, up, more, than, half, the, market, the, development, of, the, cattle, trade, is, taken, as, evidence, that, the, pre, improvement, highlands, was, not, an, immutable, system, but, did, exploit, the, economic, opportunities, that, came, its, way, 24, the, illicit, whisky, trade, demonstrates, the, entrepreneurial, ability, of, the, peasant, classes, 119, 34, agricultural, improvement, reached, the, highlands, mostly, over, the, period, 1760, to, 1850, agricultural, advisors, factors, land, surveyors, and, others, educated, in, the, thinking, of, adam, smith, were, keen, to, put, into, practice, the, new, ideas, taught, in, scottish, universities, 141, highland, landowners, many, of, whom, were, burdened, with, chronic, debts, were, generally, receptive, to, the, advice, they, offered, and, keen, to, increase, the, income, from, their, land, 417, in, the, east, and, south, the, resulting, change, was, similar, to, that, in, the, lowlands, with, the, creation, of, larger, farms, with, single, tenants, enclosure, of, the, old, run, rig, fields, introduction, of, new, crops, such, as, turnips, land, drainage, and, as, a, consequence, of, all, this, eviction, as, part, of, the, highland, clearances, of, many, tenants, and, cottars, some, of, those, cleared, found, employment, on, the, new, larger, farms, others, moved, to, the, accessible, towns, of, the, lowlands, 1, 12, in, the, west, and, north, evicted, tenants, were, usually, given, tenancies, in, newly, created, crofting, communities, while, their, former, holdings, were, converted, into, large, sheep, farms, sheep, farmers, could, pay, substantially, higher, rents, than, the, run, rig, farmers, and, were, much, less, prone, to, falling, into, arrears, each, croft, was, limited, in, size, so, that, the, tenants, would, have, to, find, work, elsewhere, the, major, alternatives, were, fishing, and, the, kelp, industry, landlords, took, control, of, the, kelp, shores, deducting, the, wages, earned, by, their, tenants, from, the, rent, due, and, retaining, the, large, profits, that, could, be, earned, at, the, high, prices, paid, for, the, processed, product, during, the, napoleonic, wars, 1, 12, when, the, napoleonic, wars, finished, in, 1815, the, highland, industries, were, affected, by, the, return, to, a, peacetime, economy, the, price, of, black, cattle, fell, nearly, halving, between, 1810, and, the, 1830s, kelp, prices, had, peaked, in, 1810, but, reduced, from, 9, a, ton, in, 1823, to, 3, 13s, 4d, a, ton, in, 1828, wool, prices, were, also, badly, affected, 370, 71, this, worsened, the, financial, problems, of, debt, encumbered, landlords, then, in, 1846, potato, blight, arrived, in, the, highlands, wiping, out, the, essential, subsistence, crop, for, the, overcrowded, crofting, communities, as, the, famine, struck, the, government, made, clear, to, landlords, that, it, was, their, responsibility, to, provide, famine, relief, for, their, tenants, the, result, of, the, economic, downturn, had, been, that, a, large, proportion, of, highland, estates, were, sold, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, t, m, devine, points, out, that, in, the, region, most, affected, by, the, potato, famine, by, 1846, 70, per, cent, of, the, landowners, were, new, purchasers, who, had, not, owned, highland, property, before, 1800, more, landlords, were, obliged, to, sell, due, to, the, cost, of, famine, relief, those, who, were, protected, from, the, worst, of, the, crisis, were, those, with, extensive, rental, income, from, sheep, farms, 93, 95, government, loans, were, made, available, for, drainage, works, road, building, and, other, improvements, and, many, crofters, became, temporary, migrants, taking, work, in, the, lowlands, when, the, potato, famine, ceased, in, 1856, this, established, a, pattern, of, more, extensive, working, away, from, the, highlands, 146, 66, the, unequal, concentration, of, land, ownership, remained, an, emotional, and, controversial, subject, of, enormous, importance, to, the, highland, economy, and, eventually, became, a, cornerstone, of, liberal, radicalism, the, poor, crofters, were, politically, powerless, and, many, of, them, turned, to, religion, they, embraced, the, popularly, oriented, fervently, evangelical, presbyterian, revival, after, 1800, most, joined, the, breakaway, free, church, after, 1843, this, evangelical, movement, was, led, by, lay, preachers, who, themselves, came, from, the, lower, strata, and, whose, preaching, was, implicitly, critical, of, the, established, order, the, religious, change, energised, the, crofters, and, separated, them, from, the, landlords, it, helped, prepare, them, for, their, successful, and, violent, challenge, to, the, landlords, in, the, 1880s, through, the, highland, land, league, violence, erupted, starting, on, the, isle, of, skye, when, highland, landlords, cleared, their, lands, for, sheep, and, deer, parks, it, was, quietened, when, the, government, stepped, in, passing, the, crofters, holdings, scotland, act, 1886, to, reduce, rents, guarantee, fixity, of, tenure, and, break, up, large, estates, to, provide, crofts, for, the, homeless, this, contrasted, with, the, irish, land, war, underway, at, the, same, time, where, the, irish, were, intensely, politicised, through, roots, in, irish, nationalism, while, political, dimensions, were, limited, in, 1885, three, independent, crofter, candidates, were, elected, to, parliament, which, listened, to, their, pleas, the, results, included, explicit, security, for, the, scottish, smallholders, in, the, crofting, counties, the, legal, right, to, bequeath, tenancies, to, descendants, and, the, creation, of, a, crofting, commission, the, crofters, as, a, political, movement, faded, away, by, 1892, and, the, liberal, party, gained, their, votes, today, the, highlands, are, the, largest, of, scotland, s, whisky, producing, regions, the, relevant, area, runs, from, orkney, to, the, isle, of, arran, in, the, south, and, includes, the, northern, isles, and, much, of, inner, and, outer, hebrides, argyll, stirlingshire, arran, as, well, as, sections, of, perthshire, and, aberdeenshire, other, sources, treat, the, islands, except, islay, as, a, separate, whisky, producing, region, this, massive, area, has, over, 30, distilleries, or, 47, when, the, islands, sub, region, is, included, in, the, count, according, to, one, source, the, top, five, are, macallan, glenfiddich, aberlour, glenfarclas, and, balvenie, while, speyside, is, geographically, within, the, highlands, that, region, is, specified, as, distinct, in, terms, of, whisky, productions, speyside, single, malt, whiskies, are, produced, by, about, 50, distilleries, according, to, visit, scotland, highlands, whisky, is, fruity, sweet, spicy, malty, another, review, states, that, northern, highlands, single, malt, is, sweet, and, full, bodied, the, eastern, highlands, and, southern, highlands, whiskies, tend, to, be, lighter, in, texture, while, the, distilleries, in, the, western, highlands, produce, single, malts, with, a, much, peatier, influence, the, scottish, reformation, achieved, partial, success, in, the, highlands, roman, catholicism, remained, strong, in, some, areas, owing, to, remote, locations, and, the, efforts, of, franciscan, missionaries, from, ireland, who, regularly, came, to, celebrate, mass, there, remain, significant, catholic, strongholds, within, the, highlands, and, islands, such, as, moidart, and, morar, on, the, mainland, and, south, uist, and, barra, in, the, southern, outer, hebrides, the, remoteness, of, the, region, and, the, lack, of, a, gaelic, speaking, clergy, undermined, the, missionary, efforts, of, the, established, church, the, later, 18th, century, saw, somewhat, greater, success, owing, to, the, efforts, of, the, sspck, missionaries, and, to, the, disruption, of, traditional, society, after, the, battle, of, culloden, in, 1746, in, the, 19th, century, the, evangelical, free, churches, which, were, more, accepting, of, gaelic, language, and, culture, grew, rapidly, appealing, much, more, strongly, than, did, the, established, church, for, the, most, part, however, the, highlands, are, considered, predominantly, protestant, belonging, to, the, church, of, scotland, in, contrast, to, the, catholic, southern, islands, the, northern, outer, hebrides, islands, lewis, harris, and, north, uist, have, an, exceptionally, high, proportion, of, their, population, belonging, to, the, protestant, free, church, of, scotland, or, the, free, presbyterian, church, of, scotland, the, outer, hebrides, have, been, described, as, the, last, bastion, of, calvinism, in, britain, and, the, sabbath, remains, widely, observed, inverness, and, the, surrounding, area, has, a, majority, protestant, population, with, most, locals, belonging, to, either, the, kirk, or, the, free, church, of, scotland, the, church, maintains, a, noticeable, presence, within, the, area, with, church, attendance, notably, higher, than, in, other, parts, of, scotland, religion, continues, to, play, an, important, role, in, highland, culture, with, sabbath, observance, still, widely, practised, particularly, in, the, hebrides, in, traditional, scottish, geography, the, highlands, refers, to, that, part, of, scotland, north, west, of, the, highland, boundary, fault, which, crosses, mainland, scotland, in, a, near, straight, line, from, helensburgh, to, stonehaven, however, the, flat, coastal, lands, that, occupy, parts, of, the, counties, of, nairnshire, morayshire, banffshire, and, aberdeenshire, are, often, excluded, as, they, do, not, share, the, distinctive, geographical, and, cultural, features, of, the, rest, of, the, highlands, the, north, east, of, caithness, as, well, as, orkney, and, shetland, are, also, often, excluded, from, the, highlands, although, the, hebrides, are, usually, included, the, highland, area, as, so, defined, differed, from, the, lowlands, in, language, and, tradition, having, preserved, gaelic, speech, and, customs, centuries, after, the, anglicisation, of, the, latter, this, led, to, a, growing, perception, of, a, divide, with, the, cultural, distinction, between, highlander, and, lowlander, first, noted, towards, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, in, aberdeenshire, the, boundary, between, the, highlands, and, the, lowlands, is, not, well, defined, there, is, a, stone, beside, the, a93, road, near, the, village, of, dinnet, on, royal, deeside, which, states, you, are, now, in, the, highlands, although, there, are, areas, of, highland, character, to, the, east, of, this, point, a, much, wider, definition, of, the, highlands, is, that, used, by, the, scotch, whisky, industry, highland, single, malts, are, produced, at, distilleries, north, of, an, imaginary, line, between, dundee, and, greenock, thus, including, all, of, aberdeenshire, and, angus, inverness, is, regarded, as, the, capital, of, the, highlands, although, less, so, in, the, highland, parts, of, aberdeenshire, angus, perthshire, and, stirlingshire, which, look, more, to, aberdeen, dundee, perth, and, stirling, as, their, commercial, centres, the, highland, council, area, created, as, one, of, the, local, government, regions, of, scotland, has, been, a, unitary, council, area, since, 1996, the, council, area, excludes, a, large, area, of, the, southern, and, eastern, highlands, and, the, western, isles, but, includes, caithness, highlands, is, sometimes, used, however, as, a, name, for, the, council, area, as, in, the, former, highlands, and, islands, fire, and, rescue, service, northern, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, area, as, in, the, former, northern, constabulary, these, former, bodies, both, covered, the, highland, council, area, and, the, island, council, areas, of, orkney, shetland, and, the, western, isles, highland, council, signs, in, the, pass, of, drumochter, between, glen, garry, and, dalwhinnie, say, welcome, to, the, highlands, much, of, the, highlands, area, overlaps, the, highlands, and, islands, area, an, electoral, region, called, highlands, and, islands, is, used, in, elections, to, the, scottish, parliament, this, area, includes, orkney, and, shetland, as, well, as, the, highland, council, local, government, area, the, western, isles, and, most, of, the, argyll, and, bute, and, moray, local, government, areas, highlands, and, islands, has, however, different, meanings, in, different, contexts, it, means, highland, the, local, government, area, orkney, shetland, and, the, western, isles, in, highlands, and, islands, fire, and, rescue, service, northern, as, in, northern, constabulary, refers, to, the, same, area, as, that, covered, by, the, fire, and, rescue, service, there, have, been, trackways, from, the, lowlands, to, the, highlands, since, prehistoric, times, many, traverse, the, mounth, a, spur, of, mountainous, land, that, extends, from, the, higher, inland, range, to, the, north, sea, slightly, north, of, stonehaven, the, most, well, known, and, historically, important, trackways, are, the, causey, mounth, elsick, mounth, cryne, corse, mounth, and, cairnamounth, although, most, of, the, highlands, is, geographically, on, the, british, mainland, it, is, somewhat, less, accessible, than, the, rest, of, britain, thus, most, uk, couriers, categorise, it, separately, alongside, northern, ireland, the, isle, of, man, and, other, offshore, islands, they, thus, charge, additional, fees, for, delivery, to, the, highlands, or, exclude, the, area, entirely, while, the, physical, remoteness, from, the, largest, population, centres, inevitably, leads, to, higher, transit, cost, there, is, confusion, and, consternation, over, the, scale, of, the, fees, charged, and, the, effectiveness, of, their, communication, and, the, use, of, the, word, mainland, in, their, justification, since, the, charges, are, often, based, on, postcode, areas, many, far, less, remote, areas, including, some, which, are, traditionally, considered, part, of, the, lowlands, are, also, subject, to, these, charges, royal, mail, is, the, only, delivery, network, bound, by, a, universal,
