depth, lake, malawi, the, world, s, eighth, largest, freshwater, lake, by, area, and, lake, turkana, the, world, s, largest, permanent, desert, lake, and, the, world, s, largest, alkaline, lake, collectively, they, contain, 31, 000, km, 3, 7, 400, cu, mi, of, water, which, is, more, than, either, lake, baikal, or, the, north, american, great, lakes, this, total, constitutes, about, 25, of, the, planet, s, unfrozen, surface, fresh, water, the, large, rift, lakes, of, africa, are, the, ancient, home, of, great, biodiversity, and, 10, of, the, world, s, fish, species, live, in, this, region, countries, in, the, area, which, are, bounded, by, the, lakes, of, the, great, lakes, region, include, burundi, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, ethiopia, kenya, malawi, mozambique, rwanda, zambia, tanzania, and, uganda, the, following, are, included, on, most, lists, of, the, african, great, lakes, grouped, by, drainage, basin, the, exact, number, of, lakes, considered, part, of, the, african, great, lakes, varies, by, list, and, may, include, smaller, lakes, in, the, rift, valleys, especially, if, they, are, part, of, the, same, drainage, basin, as, the, larger, lakes, such, as, lake, kyoga, the, great, lakes, region, rarely, greater, lakes, region, consists, of, ten, riparian, countries, burundi, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, ethiopia, kenya, malawi,

bountiful, waters, of, the, equatorial, plateau, either, flowed, west, into, the, congo, river, system, or, east, to, the, indian, ocean, this, was, changed, by, the, formation, of, the, great, rift, valley, a, rift, is, a, weak, place, in, earth, s, crust, due, to, the, separation, of, two, tectonic, plates, often, accompanied, by, a, graben, or, trough, in, which, lake, water, can, collect, this, rift, began, when, east, africa, impelled, by, currents, in, the, mantle, began, separating, from, the, rest, of, africa, moving, to, the, northeast, the, basins, that, resulted, from, the, geological, uplifts, filled, with, water, that, now, flowed, north, lake, victoria, is, not, actually, within, the, rift, valley, it, occupies, a, depression, between, the, eastern, and, western, rifts, formed, by, the, uplift, of, the, rifts, to, either, of, its, sides, around, two, to, three, million, years, ago, lake, turkana, was, larger, and, the, area, more, fertile, making, it, a,
