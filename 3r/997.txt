estimated, population, of, 2, 098, 000, residents, as, of, 2021, it, was, syria, s, largest, city, until, its, population, was, surpassed, by, damascus, the, capital, of, syria, the, largest, in, syria, s, northern, governorates, and, also, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, levant, region, aleppo, is, one, of, the, oldest, continuously, inhabited, cities, in, the, world, it, may, have, been, inhabited, since, the, sixth, millennium, bc, excavations, at, tell, as, sawda, and, tell, al, ansari, just, south, of, the, old, city, of, aleppo, show, that, the, area, was, occupied, by, amorites, by, the, latter, part, of, the, third, millennium, bc, that, is, also, the, time, at, which, aleppo, is, first, mentioned, in, cuneiform, tablets, unearthed, in, ebla, and, mesopotamia, which, speak, of, it, as, part, of, the, amorite, state, of, yamhad, and, note, its, commercial, and, military, importance, such, a, long, history, is, attributed, to, its, strategic, location, as, a, trading, center, between, the, mediterranean, sea, and, mesopotamia, for, centuries, aleppo, was, the, largest, city, in, the, syrian, region, and, the, ottoman, empire, s, third, largest, after, constantinople, now, istanbul, and, cairo, the, city, s, significance, in, history, has, been, its, location, at, one, end, of, the, silk, road, which, passed, through, central, asia, and, mesopotamia, when, the, suez, canal, was, inaugurated, in, 1869, much, trade, was, diverted, to, sea, and, aleppo, began, its, slow, decline, at, the, fall, of, the, ottoman, empire, after, world, war, i, aleppo, lost, its, northern, hinterland, to, modern, turkey, as, well, as, the, important, baghdad, railway, connecting, it, to, mosul, in, the, 1940s, it, lost, its, main, access, to, the, sea, by, antakya, and, skenderun, also, to, turkey, the, growth, in, importance, of, damascus, in, the, past, few, decades, further, exacerbated, the, situation, this, decline, may, have, helped, to, preserve, the, old, city, of, aleppo, its, medieval, architecture, and, traditional, heritage, it, won, the, title, of, the, islamic, capital, of, culture, 2006, and, has, had, a, wave, of, successful, restorations, of, its, historic, landmarks, the, battle, of, aleppo, occurred, in, the, city, during, the, syrian, civil, war, and, many, parts, of, the, city, had, suffered, massive, destruction, affected, parts, of, the, city, are, currently, undergoing, reconstruction, an, estimated, 31, 000, people, were, killed, in, aleppo, during, the, conflict, modern, day, english, speakers, commonly, refer, to, the, city, as, aleppo, it, was, known, in, antiquity, as, khalpe, khalibon, and, to, the, greeks, and, romans, as, beroea, during, the, crusades, and, again, during, the, mandate, for, syria, and, the, lebanon, of, 1923, 1946, the, name, alep, was, used, aleppo, represents, the, italianised, version, of, this, the, original, ancient, name, alab, has, survived, as, the, current, arabic, name, of, the, city, it, is, of, obscure, origin, some, have, proposed, that, alab, means, iron, or, copper, in, the, amorite, language, since, the, area, served, as, a, major, source, of, these, metals, in, antiquity, another, possibility, is, that, alab, means, white, as, this, is, the, word, for, white, in, aramaic, this, may, explain, how, alab, became, the, hebrew, word, for, milk, or, vice, versa, as, well, as, offering, a, possible, explanation, for, the, modern, day, arabic, nickname, of, the, city, al, shahb, arabic, which, means, the, white, colored, mixed, with, black, and, allegedly, derives, from, the, white, marble, found, at, aleppo, according, to, a, folk, etymology, related, by, the, twelfth, century, ce, rabbi, pethahiah, of, regensburg, and, the, traveler, ibn, battuta, the, name, derives, from, hebrew, lit, milk, or, arabic, aleb, lit, milk, because, abraham, milked, his, sheep, there, to, feed, the, poor, from, the, 11th, century, it, was, common, rabbinic, usage, to, apply, the, term, aram, zobah, to, the, area, of, aleppo, and, many, syrian, jews, continue, to, do, so, aleppo, has, scarcely, been, touched, by, archaeologists, since, the, modern, city, occupies, its, ancient, site, the, earliest, occupation, of, the, site, was, around, 8, 000, bc, as, shown, by, excavations, in, tallet, alsauda, aleppo, appears, in, historical, records, as, an, important, city, much, earlier, than, damascus, the, first, record, of, aleppo, comes, from, the, third, millennium, bc, in, the, ebla, tablets, when, aleppo, was, referred, to, as, ha, lam, some, historians, such, as, wayne, horowitz, identify, aleppo, with, the, capital, of, an, independent, kingdom, closely, related, to, ebla, known, as, armi, although, this, identification, is, contested, the, main, temple, of, the, storm, god, hadad, was, located, on, the, citadel, hill, in, the, center, of, the, city, when, the, city, was, known, as, the, city, of, hadad, naram, sin, of, akkad, mentioned, his, destruction, of, ebla, and, armanum, in, the, 23rd, century, bc, however, the, identification, of, armani, in, the, inscription, of, naram, sim, as, armi, in, the, eblaite, tablets, is, heavily, debated, as, there, was, no, akkadian, annexation, of, ebla, or, northern, syria, in, the, old, babylonian, and, old, assyrian, empire, period, aleppo, s, name, appears, in, its, original, form, as, alab, alba, for, the, first, time, aleppo, was, the, capital, of, the, important, amorite, dynasty, of, yam, ad, the, kingdom, of, yam, ad, c, 1800, 1525, bc, alternatively, known, as, the, land, of, alab, was, one, of, the, most, powerful, in, the, near, east, during, the, reign, of, yarim, lim, i, who, formed, an, alliance, with, hammurabi, of, babylonia, against, shamshi, adad, i, of, assyria, yam, ad, was, devastated, by, the, hittites, under, mursili, i, in, the, 16th, century, bc, however, it, soon, resumed, its, leading, role, in, the, levant, when, the, hittite, power, in, the, region, waned, due, to, internal, strife, taking, advantage, of, the, power, vacuum, in, the, region, baratarna, king, of, the, hurrian, kingdom, of, mitanni, instigated, a, rebellion, that, ended, the, life, of, yamhad, s, last, king, ilim, ilimma, i, in, c, 1525, bc, subsequently, parshatatar, conquered, aleppo, and, the, city, found, itself, on, the, frontline, in, the, struggle, between, the, mitanni, the, hittites, and, egypt, niqmepa, of, alalakh, who, descends, from, the, old, yamhadite, kings, controlled, the, city, as, a, vassal, to, mitanni, and, was, attacked, by, tudhaliya, i, of, the, hittites, as, a, retaliation, for, his, alliance, to, mitanni, later, the, hittite, king, suppiluliumas, i, permanently, defeated, mitanni, and, conquered, aleppo, in, the, 14th, century, bc, suppiluliumas, installed, his, son, telepinus, as, king, and, a, dynasty, of, suppiluliumas, descendants, ruled, aleppo, until, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, however, talmi, arruma, grandson, of, suppiluliumas, i, who, was, the, king, of, aleppo, had, fought, on, the, hittite, side, along, with, king, muwatalli, ii, during, the, battle, of, kadesh, against, the, egyptian, army, led, by, ramesses, ii, aleppo, had, cultic, importance, to, the, hittites, as, the, center, of, worship, of, the, storm, god, this, religious, importance, continued, after, the, collapse, of, the, hittite, empire, at, the, hands, of, the, assyrians, and, phrygians, in, the, 12th, century, bc, when, aleppo, became, part, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, whose, king, renovated, the, temple, of, hadad, which, was, discovered, in, 2003, in, 2003, a, statue, of, a, king, named, taita, bearing, inscriptions, in, luwian, was, discovered, during, excavations, conducted, by, german, archeologist, kay, kohlmeyer, in, the, citadel, of, aleppo, the, new, readings, of, anatolian, hieroglyphic, signs, proposed, by, the, hittitologists, elisabeth, rieken, and, ilya, yakubovich, were, conducive, to, the, conclusion, that, the, country, ruled, by, taita, was, called, palistin, this, country, extended, in, the, 11th, 10th, centuries, bc, from, the, amouq, valley, in, the, west, to, aleppo, in, the, east, down, to, maharda, and, shaizar, in, the, south, due, to, the, similarity, between, palistin, and, philistines, hittitologist, john, david, hawkins, who, translated, the, aleppo, inscriptions, hypothesizes, a, connection, between, the, syro, hittite, states, palistin, and, the, philistines, as, do, archaeologists, benjamin, sass, and, kay, kohlmeyer, gershon, galil, suggests, that, king, david, halted, the, arameans, expansion, into, the, land, of, israel, on, account, of, his, alliance, with, the, southern, philistine, kings, as, well, as, with, toi, king, of, amath, who, is, identified, with, tai, ta, ii, king, of, palistin, the, northern, sea, peoples, during, the, early, years, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, aleppo, was, incorporated, into, the, aramean, realm, of, bit, agusi, which, held, its, capital, at, arpad, bit, agusi, along, with, aleppo, and, the, entirety, of, the, levant, was, conquered, by, the, assyrians, in, the, 8th, century, bc, and, became, part, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, during, the, reign, of, tiglath, pileser, iii, until, the, late, 7th, century, bc, before, passing, through, the, hands, of, the, neo, babylonians, and, the, achaemenid, persians, the, region, remained, known, as, aramea, and, eber, nari, throughout, these, periods, alexander, the, great, took, over, the, city, in, 333, bc, seleucus, nicator, established, a, hellenic, settlement, in, the, site, between, 301, and, 286, bc, he, called, it, beroea, after, beroea, in, macedon, it, is, sometimes, spelled, as, beroia, beroea, is, mentioned, in, 1, macc, 9, 4, northern, syria, was, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, hellenistic, colonizing, activity, and, therefore, of, hellenistic, culture, in, the, seleucid, empire, as, did, other, hellenized, cities, of, the, seleucid, kingdom, beroea, probably, enjoyed, a, measure, of, local, autonomy, with, a, local, civic, assembly, or, boul, composed, of, free, hellenes, beroea, remained, under, seleucid, rule, until, 88, bc, when, syria, was, conquered, by, the, armenian, king, tigranes, the, great, and, beroea, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, armenia, after, the, roman, victory, over, tigranes, syria, was, handed, over, to, pompey, in, 64, bc, at, which, time, they, became, a, roman, province, rome, s, presence, afforded, relative, stability, in, northern, syria, for, over, three, centuries, although, the, province, was, administered, by, a, legate, from, rome, rome, did, not, impose, its, administrative, organization, on, the, greek, speaking, ruling, class, or, aramaic, speaking, populace, the, roman, era, saw, an, increase, in, the, population, of, northern, syria, that, accelerated, under, the, byzantines, well, into, the, 5th, century, in, late, antiquity, beroea, was, the, second, largest, syrian, city, after, antioch, the, capital, of, roman, syria, and, the, third, largest, city, in, the, roman, world, archaeological, evidence, indicates, a, high, population, density, for, settlements, between, antioch, and, beroea, right, up, to, the, 6th, century, this, agrarian, landscape, still, holds, the, remains, of, large, estate, houses, and, churches, such, as, the, church, of, saint, simeon, stylites, the, names, of, several, bishops, of, the, episcopal, see, of, beroea, which, was, in, the, roman, province, of,

own, quarter, in, the, old, town, a, fact, that, led, them, to, establish, a, new, neighbourhood, in, 1420, built, at, the, northern, suburbs, of, aleppo, outside, the, city, walls, to, become, known, as, al, jdeydeh, quarter, new, district, arabic, aleppo, became, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1516, as, part, of, the, vast, expansion, of, the, ottoman, borders, during, the, reign, of, selim, i, the, city, then, had, around, 50, 000, inhabitants, or, 11, 224, households, according, to, an, ottoman, census, in, 1517, selim, i, obtained, a, fatwa, from, sunnite, religious, leaders, and, unleashed, violence, on, the, alawites, killing, 9, 400, men, which, is, known, as, the, massacre, of, the, telal, it, was, the, centre, of, the, aleppo, eyalet, the, rest, of, what, later, became, syria, was, part, of, either, the, eyalets, of, damascus, tripoli, sidon, or, raqqa, following, the, ottoman, provincial, reform, of, 1864, aleppo, became, the, centre, of, the, newly, constituted, vilayet, of, aleppo, in, 1866, aleppo, s, agriculture, was, well, developed, in, the, ottoman, period, archaeological, excavations, revealed, water, mills, in, its, river, basin, contemporary, chinese, source, also, suggests, aleppo, in, the, ottoman, period, had, well, developed, animal, husbandry, during, his, travels, to, the, levant, in, the, 17th, century, french, traveler, jacques, goujon, recounted, how, the, maronite, community, in, aleppo, facing, financial, difficulties, and, considering, conversion, to, islam, due, to, their, inability, to, pay, the, jizya, tax, was, aided, by, the, franciscans, who, bought, their, church, enabling, them, to, meet, their, tax, obligations, moreover, thanks, to, its, strategic, geographic, location, on, the, trade, route, between, anatolia, and, the, east, aleppo, rose, to, high, prominence, in, the, ottoman, era, at, one, point, being, second, only, to, constantinople, in, the, empire, by, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, aleppo, had, displaced, damascus, as, the, principal, market, for, goods, coming, to, the, mediterranean, region, from, the, east, this, is, reflected, by, the, fact, that, the, levant, company, of, london, a, joint, trading, company, founded, in, 1581, to, monopolize, england, s, trade, with, the, ottoman, empire, never, attempted, to, settle, a, factor, or, agent, in, damascus, despite, having, had, permission, to, do, so, aleppo, served, as, the, company, s, headquarters, until, the, late, 18th, century, as, a, result, of, the, economic, development, many, european, states, had, opened, consulates, in, aleppo, during, the, 16th, and, the, 17th, centuries, such, as, the, consulate, of, the, republic, of, venice, in, 1548, the, consulate, of, france, in, 1562, the, consulate, of, england, in, 1583, and, the, consulate, of, the, netherlands, in, 1613, the, armenian, community, of, aleppo, also, rose, to, prominence, in, this, period, as, they, moved, into, the, city, to, take, up, trade, and, developed, the, new, quarter, of, judayda, the, most, outstanding, among, aleppine, armenian, merchants, during, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, were, khwaja, petik, chelebi, the, richest, merchant, in, the, city, and, his, brother, khwaja, sanos, chelebi, who, monopolized, aleppine, silk, trade, and, were, important, patrons, of, the, armenians, however, the, prosperity, aleppo, experienced, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, started, to, fade, as, silk, production, in, iran, went, into, decline, with, the, fall, of, the, safavid, dynasty, in, 1722, by, mid, century, caravans, were, no, longer, bringing, silk, from, iran, to, aleppo, and, local, syrian, production, was, insufficient, for, europe, s, demand, european, merchants, left, aleppo, and, the, city, went, into, an, economic, decline, that, was, not, reversed, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, locally, produced, cotton, and, tobacco, became, the, principal, commodities, of, interest, to, the, europeans, according, to, halil, nalc, k, aleppo, underwent, its, worst, catastrophe, with, the, wholesale, destruction, of, its, villages, by, bedouin, raiding, in, the, later, years, of, the, century, creating, a, long, running, famine, which, by, 1798, killed, half, of, its, inhabitants, the, economy, of, aleppo, was, badly, hit, by, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, this, in, addition, to, political, instability, that, followed, the, implementation, of, significant, reforms, in, 1841, by, the, central, government, contributed, to, aleppo, s, decline, and, the, rise, of, damascus, as, a, serious, economic, and, political, competitor, with, aleppo, the, city, nevertheless, continued, to, play, an, important, economic, role, and, shifted, its, commercial, focus, from, long, distance, caravan, trade, to, more, regional, trade, in, wool, and, agricultural, products, this, period, also, saw, the, immigration, of, numerous, levantine, european, origin, families, who, dominated, international, trade, aleppo, s, mixed, commercial, tribunal, ticaret, mahkamesi, one, of, the, first, in, the, ottoman, empire, was, set, up, around, 1855, reference, is,

colony, of, western, european, merchants, living, there, the, city, remained, ottoman, until, the, empire, s, collapse, but, was, occasionally, riven, with, internal, feuds, as, well, as, attacks, of, cholera, from, 1823, around, 20, 25, percent, of, the, population, died, of, plague, in, 1827, in, 1850, a, muslim, mob, attacked, christian, neighbourhoods, tens, of, christians, were, killed, and, several, churches, looted, though, this, event, has, been, portrayed, as, driven, by, pure, sectarian, principles, bruce, masters, argues, that, such, analysis, of, this, period, of, violence, is, too, shallow, and, neglects, the, tensions, that, existed, among, the, population, due, to, the, commercial, favor, afforded, to, certain, christian, minorities, by, the, tanzimat, reforms, during, this, time, which, played, a, large, role, in, creating, antagonism, between, previously, cooperative, groups, of, muslim, and, christians, in, the, eastern, quarters, of, the, city, by, 1901, the, city, s, population, was, around, 110, 000, in, october, 1918, aleppo, was, captured, by, prince, feisal, s, sherifial, forces, and, the, 5th, cavalry, division, of, the, allied, forces, from, the, ottoman, empire, during, the, world, war, i, at, the, end, of, war, the, treaty, of, s, vres, made, most, of, the, province, of, aleppo, part, of, the, newly, established, nation, of, syria, while, cilicia, was, promised, by, france, to, become, an, armenian, state, however, kemal, atat, rk, annexed, most, of, the, province, of, aleppo, as, well, as, cilicia, to, turkey, in, his, war, of, independence, the, arab, residents, in, the, province, as, well, as, the, kurds, supported, the, turks, in, this, war, against, the, french, including, the, leader, of, the, hananu, revolt, ibrahim, hananu, who, directly, coordinated, with, atat, rk, and, received, weaponry, from, him, the, outcome, however, was, disastrous, for, aleppo, because, as, per, the, treaty, of, lausanne, most, of, the, province, of, aleppo, was, made, part, of, turkey, with, the, exception, of, aleppo, and, alexandretta, thus, aleppo, was, cut, from, its, northern, satellites, and, from, the, anatolian, cities, beyond, on, which, aleppo, depended, heavily, in, commerce, moreover, the, sykes, picot, division, of, the, near, east, separated, aleppo, from, most, of, mesopotamia, which, also, harmed, the, economy, of, aleppo, the, state, of, aleppo, was, declared, by, french, general, henri, gouraud, in, september, 1920, as, part, of, a, french, plan, to, make, syria, easier, to, administer, by, dividing, it, into, several, smaller, states, france, became, more, concerned, about, the, idea, of, a, united, syria, after, the, battle, of, maysaloun, by, separating, aleppo, from, damascus, gouraud, wanted, to, capitalize, on, a, traditional, state, of, competition, between, the, two, cities, and, turn, it, into, political, division, the, people, in, aleppo, were, unhappy, with, the, fact, that, damascus, was, chosen, as, capital, for, the, new, nation, of, syria, gouraud, sensed, this, sentiment, and, tried, to, address, it, by, making, aleppo, the, capital, of, a, large, and, wealthier, state, with, which, it, would, have, been, hard, for, damascus, to, compete, the, state, of, aleppo, as, drawn, by, france, contained, most, of, the, fertile, area, of, syria, the, fertile, countryside, of, aleppo, in, addition, to, the, entire, fertile, basin, of, river, euphrates, the, state, also, had, access, to, sea, via, the, autonomous, sanjak, of, alexandretta, on, the, other, hand, damascus, which, is, basically, an, oasis, on, the, fringes, of, the, syrian, desert, had, neither, enough, fertile, land, nor, access, to, sea, basically, gouraud, wanted, to, satisfy, aleppo, by, giving, it, control, over, most, of, the, agricultural, and, mineral, wealth, of, syria, so, that, it, would, never, want, to, unite, with, damascus, again, the, limited, economic, resources, of, the, syrian, states, made, the, option, of, completely, independent, states, undesirable, for, france, because, it, threatened, an, opposite, result, the, states, collapsing, and, being, forced, back, into, unity, this, was, why, france, proposed, the, idea, of, a, syrian, federation, that, was, realized, in, 1923, initially, gouraud, envisioned, the, federation, as, encompassing, all, the, states, even, lebanon, in, the, end, however, only, three, states, participated, aleppo, damascus, and, the, alawite, state, the, capital, of, the, federation, was, aleppo, at, first, but, it, was, relocated, to, damascus, the, president, of, the, federation, was, subhi, barakat, an, antioch, born, politician, from, aleppo, the, federation, ended, in, december, 1924, when, france, merged, aleppo, and, damascus, into, a, single, syrian, state, and, separated, the, alawite, state, again, this, action, came, after, the, federation, decided, to, merge, the, three, federated, states, into, one, and, to, take, steps, encouraging, syria, s, financial, independence, steps, which, france, viewed, as, too, much, when, the, syrian, revolt, erupted, in, southern, syria, in, 1925, the, french, held, in, aleppo, state, new, elections, that, were, supposed, to, lead, to, the, breaking, of, the, union, with, damascus, and, restore, the, independence, of, aleppo, state, the, french, were, driven, to, believe, by, pro, french, aleppine, politicians, that, the, people, in, aleppo, were, supportive, of, such, a, scheme, after, the, new, council, was, elected, however, it, surprisingly, voted, to, keep, the, union, with, damascus, syrian, nationalists, had, waged, a, massive, anti, secession, public, campaign, that, vigorously, mobilized, the, people, against, the, secession, plan, thus, leaving, the, pro, french, politicians, no, choice, but, to, support, the, union, the, result, was, a, big, embarrassment, for, france, which, wanted, the, secession, of, aleppo, to, be, a, punitive, measure, against, damascus, which, had, participated, in, the, syrian, revolt, however, the, result, was, respected, this, was, the, last, time, that, independence, was, proposed, for, aleppo, bad, economic, situation, of, the, city, after, the, separation, of, the, northern, countryside, was, exacerbated, further, in, 1939, when, alexandretta, was, annexed, to, turkey, as, hatay, state, thus, depriving, aleppo, of, its, main, port, of, iskenderun, and, leaving, it, in, total, isolation, within, syria, the, increasing, disagreements, between, aleppo, and, damascus, led, eventually, to, the, split, of, the, national, block, into, two, factions, the, national, party, established, in, damascus, in, 1946, and, the, people, s, party, established, in, aleppo, in, 1948, by, rushdi, al, kikhya, nazim, qudsi, and, mustafa, bey, barmada, an, underlying, cause, of, the, disagreement, in, addition, to, the, union, with, iraq, was, aleppo, s, intention, to, relocate, the, capital, from, damascus, the, issue, of, the, capital, became, an, open, debate, matter, in, 1950, when, the, popular, party, presented, a, constitution, draft, that, called, damascus, a, temporary, capital, the, first, coup, d, tat, in, modern, syrian, history, was, carried, out, in, march, 1949, by, an, army, officer, from, aleppo, hussni, zaim, however, lured, by, the, absolute, power, he, enjoyed, as, a, dictator, zaim, soon, developed, a, pro, egyptian, pro, western, orientation, and, abandoned, the, cause, of, union, with, iraq, this, incited, a, second, coup, only, four, months, after, his, the, second, coup, led, by, sami, hinnawi, also, officer, from, aleppo, empowered, the, popular, party, and, actively, sought, to, realize, the, union, with, iraq, the, news, of, an, imminent, union, with, iraq, incited, a, third, coup, the, same, year, in, december, 1949, adib, shishakly, led, a, coup, preempting, a, union, with, iraq, that, was, about, to, be, declared, soon, after, shishakly, s, domination, ended, in, 1954, a, union, with, egypt, under, gamal, abdul, nasser, was, implemented, in, 1958, the, union, however, collapsed, three, and, a, half, years, later, when, a, junta, of, young, damascene, officers, carried, out, a, separatist, coup, aleppo, resisted, the, separatist, coup, but, eventually, it, had, no, choice, but, to, recognize, the, new, government, in, march, 1963, a, coalition, of, baathists, nasserists, and, socialists, launched, a, new, coup, whose, declared, objective, was, to, restore, the, union, with, egypt, however, the, new, government, only, restored, the, flag, of, the, union, soon, thereafter, disagreement, between, the, baathists, and, the, nasserists, over, the, restoration, of, the, union, became, a, crisis, and, the, baathists, ousted, the, nasserists, from, power, the, nasserists, most, of, whom, were, from, the, aleppine, middle, class, responded, with, an, insurgency, in, aleppo, in, july, 1963, again, the, ba, ath, government, tried, to, absorb, the, dissent, of, the, syrian, middle, class, whose, center, of, political, activism, was, aleppo, by, putting, to, the, front, amin, al, hafiz, a, baathist, military, officer, from, aleppo, president, hafez, al, assad, who, came, to, power, in, 1970, relied, on, support, from, the, business, class, in, damascus, this, gave, damascus, further, advantage, over, aleppo, and, hence, damascus, came, to, dominate, the, syrian, economy, the, strict, centralization, of, the, syrian, state, the, intentional, direction, of, resources, towards, damascus, and, the, hegemony, damascus, enjoys, over, the, syrian, economy, made, it, increasingly, hard, for, aleppo, to, compete, despite, this, aleppo, remained, a, nationally, important, economic, and, cultural, center, on, 16, june, 1979, thirty, two, military, cadets, were, massacred, by, antigovernmental, islamist, rebel, group, muslim, brotherhood, in, the, subsequent, violence, around, fifty, people, were, killed, on, 10,

military, operation, in, aleppo, where, syrian, government, responded, with, military, and, security, forces, sending, in, tens, of, thousands, of, troops, backed, by, tanks, armored, vehicles, and,
