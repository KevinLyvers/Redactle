the, amu, darya, m, u, d, r, j, also, called, the, amu, d, mu, sind, the, amo, and, historically, the, oxus, k, s, s, latin, xus, greek, xos, pashto, is, a, major, river, in, central, asia, which, flows, through, tajikistan, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, and, afghanistan, rising, in, the, pamir, mountains, north, of, the, hindu, kush, the, amu, darya, is, formed, by, the, confluence, of, the, vakhsh, and, panj, rivers, in, the, tigrovaya, balka, nature, reserve, on, the, border, between, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, and, flows, from, there, north, westwards, into, the, southern, remnants, of, the, aral, sea, in, its, upper, course, the, river, forms, part, of, afghanistan, s, northern, border, with, tajikistan, uzbekistan, and, turkmenistan, in, ancient, history, the, river, was, regarded, as, the, boundary, of, greater, iran, with, turan, which, roughly, corresponded, to, present, day, central, asia, the, amu, darya, has, a, flow, of, about, 70, cubic, kilometres, per, year, on, average, in, classical, antiquity, the, river, was, known, as, the, xus, in, latin, and, xos, in, greek, a, clear, derivative, of, vakhsh, the, name, of, the, largest, tributary, of, the, river, in, sanskrit, texts, the, river, is, also, referred, to, as, vak, u, the, brahmanda, purana, refers, to, the, river, as, chaksu, which, means, an, eye, the, avestan, texts, too, refer, to, the, river, as, yakhsha, vakhsha, and, yakhsha, arta, upper, yakhsha, referring, to, the, jaxartes, syr, darya, twin, river, to, amu, darya, in, middle, persian, sources, of, the, sasanian, period, the, river, is, known, as, wehr, d, lit, good, river, the, name, amu, is, said, to, have, come, from, the, medieval, city, of, mul, later, chahar, joy, charjunow, and, now, known, as, t, rkmenabat, in, modern, turkmenistan, with, darya, being, the, persian, word, for, lake, or, sea, medieval, arabic, and, islamic, sources, call, the, river, jayhoun, arabic, romanized, jay, n, also, jaihun, jayhoon, or, dzhaykhun, which, is, derived, from, gihon, the, biblical, name, for, one, of, the, four, rivers, of, the, garden, of, eden, river, amu, darya, passes, through, one, of, the, world, s, highest, deserts, western, travelers, in, the, 19th, century, mentioned, that, one, of, the, names, by, which, the, river, was, known, in, afghanistan, was, gozan, and, that, this, name, was, used, by, greek, mongol, chinese, persian, jewish, and, afghan, historians, however, this, name, is, no, longer, used, the, river, s, total, length, is, 2, 400, kilometres, 1, 500, mi, and, its, drainage, basin, totals, 534, 739, square, kilometres, 206, 464, sq, mi, in, area, providing, a, mean, discharge, of, around, 97, 4, cubic, kilometres, 23, 4, cu, mi, of, water, per, year, the, river, is, navigable, for, over, 1, 450, kilometres, 900, mi, all, of, the, water, comes, from, the, high, mountains, in, the, south, where, annual, precipitation, can, be, over, 1, 000, mm, 39, in, even, before, large, scale, irrigation, began, high, summer, evaporation, meant, that, not, all, of, this, discharge, reached, the, aral, sea, though, there, is, some, evidence, the, large, pamir, glaciers, provided, enough, meltwater, for, the, aral, to, overflow, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, since, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, there, have, been, four, different, claimants, as, the, true, source, of, the, oxus, a, glacier, turns, into, the, wakhan, river, and, joins, the, pamir, river, about, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, downstream, bill, colegrave, s, expedition, to, wakhan, in, 2007, found, that, both, claimants, 2, and, 3, had, the, same, source, the, chelab, stream, which, bifurcates, on, the, watershed, of, the, little, pamir, half, flowing, into, lake, chamaktin, and, half, into, the, parent, stream, of, the, little, pamir, sarhad, river, therefore, the, chelab, stream, may, be, properly, considered, the, true, source, or, parent, stream, of, the, oxus, the, panj, river, forms, the, border, of, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, it, flows, west, to, ishkashim, where, it, turns, north, and, then, north, west, through, the, pamirs, passing, the, tajikistan, afghanistan, friendship, bridge, it, subsequently, forms, the, border, of, afghanistan, and, uzbekistan, for, about, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, passing, termez, and, the, afghanistan, uzbekistan, friendship, bridge, it, delineates, the, border, of, afghanistan, and, turkmenistan, for, another, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, before, it, flows, into, turkmenistan, at, atamurat, it, flows, across, turkmenistan, south, to, north, passing, t, rkmenabat, and, forms, the, border, of, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, from, halkabat, it, is, then, split, by, the, tuyamuyun, hydro, complex, into, many, waterways, that, used, to, form, the, river, delta, joining, the, aral, sea, passing, urgench, da, oguz, and, other, cities, but, it, does, not, reach, what, is, left, of, the, sea, any, more, and, is, lost, in, the, desert, use, of, water, from, the, amu, darya, for, irrigation, has, been, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, shrinking, of, the, aral, sea, since, the, late, 1950s, historical, records, state, that, in, different, periods, the, river, flowed, into, the, aral, sea, from, the, south, into, the, caspian, sea, from, the, east, or, both, similar, to, the, syr, darya, jaxartes, in, ancient, greek, partly, based, on, such, records, first, tsarist, and, later, soviet, engineers, proposed, to, divert, the, amu, darya, to, the, caspian, sea, by, constructing, the, transcaspian, canal, the, 534, 769, square, kilometres, 206, 475, sq, mi, of, the, amu, darya, drainage, basin, include, most, of, tajikistan, the, southwest, corner, of, kyrgyzstan, the, northeast, corner, of, afghanistan, a, narrow, portion, of, eastern, turkmenistan, and, the, western, half, of, uzbekistan, part, of, the, amu, darya, basin, divide, in, tajikistan, forms, that, country, s, border, with, china, in, the, east, and, pakistan, to, the, south, about, 61, of, the, drainage, lies, within, tajikistan, uzbekistan, and, turkmenistan, while, 39, is, in, afghanistan, the, abundant, water, flowing, in, the, amu, darya, comes, almost, entirely, from, glaciers, in, the, pamir, mountains, and, tian, shan, which, standing, above, the, surrounding, arid, plain, collect, atmospheric, moisture, which, otherwise, would, probably, escape, elsewhere, without, its, mountain, water, sources, the, amu, darya, would, not, exist, because, it, rarely, rains, in, the, lowlands, through, which, most, of, the, river, flows, of, the, total, drainage, area, only, about, 200, 000, square, kilometres, 77, 000, sq, mi, actively, contribute, water, to, the, river, this, is, because, many, of, the, river, s, major, tributaries, especially, the, zeravshan, river, have, been, diverted, and, much, of, the, river, s, drainage, is, arid, throughout, most, of, the, steppe, the, annual, rainfall, is, about, 300, millimetres, 12, in, the, ancient, greeks, called, the, amu, darya, the, oxus, in, ancient, times, the, river, was, regarded, as, the, boundary, between, greater, iran, and, r, n, persian, the, river, s, drainage, lies, in, the, area, between, the, former, empires, of, genghis, khan, and, alexander, the, great, although, they, occurred, at, very, different, times, when, the, mongols, came, to, the, area, they, used, the, water, of, the, amu, darya, to, flood, konye, urgench, one, southern, route, of, the, silk, road, ran, along, part, of, the, amu, darya, northwestward, from, termez, before, going, westwards, to, the, caspian, sea, according, to, the, quaternary, international, it, is, possible, that, the, amu, darya, s, course, across, the, karakum, desert, has, gone, through, several, major, shifts, in, the, past, few, thousand, years, much, of, the, time, most, recently, from, the, 13th, century, to, the, late, 16th, century, the, amu, darya, emptied, into, both, the, aral, and, the, caspian, seas, reaching, the, latter, via, a, large, distributary, called, the, uzboy, river, the, uzboy, splits, off, from, the, main, channel, just, south, of, the, river, s, delta, sometimes, the, flow, through, the, two, branches, was, more, or, less, equal, but, often, most, of, the, amu, darya, s, flow, split, to, the, west, and, flowed, into, the, caspian, people, began, to, settle, along, the, lower, amu, darya, and, the, uzboy, in, the, 5th, century, establishing, a, thriving, chain, of, agricultural, lands, towns, and, cities, in, about, ad, 985, the, massive, gurganj, dam, at, the, bifurcation, of, the, forks, started, to, divert, water, to, the, aral, genghis, khan, s, troops, destroyed, the, dam, in, 1221, and, the, amu, darya, shifted, to, distributing, its, flow, more, or, less, equally, between, the, main, stem, and, the, uzboy, but, in, the, 18th, century, the, river, again, turned, north, flowing, into, the, aral, sea, a, path, it, has, taken, since, less, and, less, water, flowed, down, the, uzboy, when, russian, explorer, bekovich, cherkasski, surveyed, the, region, in, 1720, the, amu, darya, did, not, flow, into, the, caspian, sea, anymore, by, the, 1800, s, the, ethnographic, makeup, of, the, region, was, described, by, peter, kropotkin, as, the, communities, of, the, vassal, khanates, of, maimene, khulm, kunduz, and, even, the, badakshan, and, wahkran, an, englishman, william, moorcroft, visited, the, oxus, around, 1824, during, the, great, game, period, another, englishman, a, naval, officer, called, john, wood, came, with, an, expedition, to, find, the, source, of, the, river, in, 1839, he, found, modern, day, lake, zorkul, called, it, lake, victoria, and, proclaimed, he, had, found, the, source, then, the, french, explorer, and, geographer, thibaut, vin, collected, a, lot, of, information, about, this, area, during, five, expeditions, between, 1856, and, 1862, the, question, of, finding, a, route, between, the, oxus, valley, and, india, has, been, of, concern, historically, a, direct, route, crosses, extremely, high, mountain, passes, in, the, hindu, kush, and, isolated, areas, like, kafiristan, some, in, britain, feared, that, the, empire, of, russia, which, at, the, time, wielded, great, influence, over, the, oxus, area, would, overcome, these, obstacles, and, find, a, suitable, route, through, which, to, invade, british, india, but, this, never, came, to, pass, the, area, was, taken, over, by, russia, during, the, russian, conquest, of, turkestan, the, soviet, union, became, the, ruling, power, in, the, early, 1920s, and, expelled, mohammed, alim, khan, it, later, put, down, the, basmachi, movement, and, killed, ibrahim, bek, a, large, refugee, population, of, central, asians, including, turkmen, tajiks, and, uzbeks, fled, to, northern, afghanistan, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, soviets, started, using, the, amu, darya, and, the, syr, darya, to, irrigate, extensive, cotton, fields, in, the, central, asian, plain, before, this, time, water, from, the, rivers, was, already, being, used, for, agriculture, but, not, on, this, massive, scale, the, qaraqum, canal, karshi, canal, and, bukhara, canal, were, among, the, largest, of, the, irrigation, diversions, built, however, the, main, turkmen, canal, which, would, have, diverted, water, along, the, dry, uzboy, river, bed, into, central, turkmenistan, was, never, built, in, the, course, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, in, the, 1970s, soviet, forces, used, the, valley, to, invade, afghanistan, through, termez, the, soviet, union, fell, in, the, 1990s, and, central, asia, split, up, into, the, many, smaller, countries, that, lie, within, or, partially, within, the, amu, darya, basin, during, the, soviet, era, a, resource, sharing, system, was, instated, in, which, kyrgyzstan, and, tajikistan, shared, water, originating, from, the, amu, and, syr, daryas, with, kazakhstan, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, in, summer, in, return, kyrgyzstan, and, tajikistan, received, kazakh, turkmen, and, uzbek, coal, gas, and, electricity, in, winter, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, this, system, disintegrated, and, the, central, asian, nations, have, failed, to, reinstate, it, inadequate, infrastructure, poor, water, management, and, outdated, irrigation, methods, all, exacerbate, the, issue, the, caspian, tiger, used, to, occur, along, the, river, s, banks, after, its, extirpation, the, darya, s, delta, was, suggested, as, a, potential, site, for, the, introduction, of, its, closest, surviving, relative, the, siberian, tiger, a, feasibility, study, was, initiated, to, investigate, if, the, area, is, suitable, and, if, such, an, initiative, would, receive, support, from, relevant, decision, makers, a, viable, tiger, population, of, about, 100, animals, would, require, at, least, 5, 000, km, 2, 1, 900, sq, mi, of, large, tracts, of, contiguous, habitat, with, rich, prey, populations, such, habitat, is, not, available, at, this, stage, and, cannot, be, provided, in, the, short, term, the, proposed, region, is, therefore, unsuitable, for, the, reintroduction, at, least, at, this, stage, since, march, 2022, the, building, of, the, 285km, qosh, tepa, canal, has, been, underway, in, northern, afghanistan, to, divert, water, from, the, amu, darya, uzbekistan, has, expressed, concern, that, the, canal, will, have, an, adverse, effect, on, its, agriculture, the, canal, is, also, expected, to, make, the, aral, sea, disaster, worse, and, in, 2023, uzbek, officials, held, talks, on, the, canal, with, the, taliban, the, taliban, has, made, the, canal, a, priority, with, images, supplied, by, planet, labs, demonstrate, that, from, april, 2022, to, february, 2023, more, than, 100, km, of, canal, was, excavated, according, to, the, taliban, the, initiative, is, expected, to, convert, 550, 000, hectares, of, desert, into, farmland, in, january, 2023, the, xinjiang, central, asia, petroleum, and,
