became, a, roman, protectorate, the, process, was, completed, in, 27, bc, when, emperor, augustus, annexed, the, rest, of, greece, and, constituted, it, as, the, senatorial, province, of, achaea, despite, their, military, superiority, the, romans, admired, and, became, heavily, influenced, by, greek, culture, greek, speaking, communities, of, the, hellenised, east, were, instrumental, in, the, spread, of, christianity, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, and, christianity, s, early, leaders, and, writers, were, mostly, greek, speaking, though, not, from, greece, itself, the, new, testament, was, written, in, greek, and, some, sections, attest, to, the, importance, of, churches, in, greece, in, early, christianity, nevertheless, much, of, greece, clung, to, paganism, and, ancient, greek, religious, practices, were, still, in, vogue, in, the, late, 4th, century, ad, when, they, were, outlawed, by, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, in, 391, 392, the, last, recorded, olympic, games,

and, huns, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, and, the, slavic, invasion, in, the, 7th, century, resulted, in, a, collapse, in, imperial, authority, in, the, greek, peninsula, the, imperial, government, retained, control, of, only, the, islands, and, coastal, areas, particularly, the, populated, walled, cities, such, as, athens, corinth, and, thessalonica, however, the, view, that, greece, underwent, decline, fragmentation, and, depopulation, is, considered, outdated, as, cities, show, institutional, continuity, and, prosperity, between, the, 4th, and, 6th, centuries, in, the, early, 6th, century, greece, had, approximately, 80, cities, according, to, the, synekdemos, chronicle, and, the, 4th, to, the, 7th, century, is, considered, one, of, high, prosperity, until, the,

came, under, imperial, control, again, this, process, was, facilitated, by, a, large, influx, of, greeks, from, sicily, and, asia, minor, to, the, greek, peninsula, while, many, slavs, were, captured, and, re, settled, in, asia, minor, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, the, return, of, stability, resulted, in, the, greek, peninsula, benefiting, from, economic, growth, the, greek, orthodox,

new, era, of, greek, patriotism, emerged, accompanied, by, a, turning, back, to, ancient, greece, in, the, 14th, century, much, of, the, greek, peninsula, was, lost, by, the, byzantine, empire, to, the, serbs, and, then, the, ottomans, constantinople, fell, to, the, ottomans, in, 1453, and, by, 1460, ottoman, conquest, of, mainland, greece, was, complete, while, most, of, mainland, greece, and,

respectively, and, venice, maintained, control, of, the, ionian, islands, until, 1797, after, which, they, fell, under, first, french, then, british, control, while, some, greeks, in, the, ionian, islands, and, constantinople, lived, in, prosperity, and, greeks, of, constantinople, phanariots, achieved, power, within, the, ottoman, administration, much, of, greece, suffered, the, economic, consequences, of, ottoman, conquest, heavy, taxes, were, enforced, and, in, later, years, the, ottoman, empire, enacted, a, policy, of, creation, of, hereditary, estates, effectively, turning, the, rural, greek, populations, into, serfs, while, the, ottoman, conquest, had, cut, greece, off, from, european, historical, developments, the, greek, orthodox, church, and, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, were, considered, by, the, ottoman, governments, as, the, ruling, authorities, of, the, entire, orthodox, christian, population, of, the, ottoman, empire, whether,

harsh, treatment, by, local, ottoman, authorities, led, to, conversions, to, islam, if, only, superficially, in, the, 19th, century, many, crypto, christians, returned, to, their, old, religious, allegiance, the, nature, of, ottoman, administration, of, greece, varied, though, it, was, invariably, arbitrary, and, often, harsh, some, cities, had, governors, appointed, by, the, sultan, while, others, like, athens, were, self, governed, municipalities, mountainous, regions, in, the, interior, and, many, islands, remained, effectively, autonomous, from, the, central, ottoman, state, for, centuries, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, are, regarded, as, a, dark, age, in, greek, history, with, the, prospect, of, overthrowing, ottoman, rule, appearing, remote, however, prior, to, the, greek, revolution, of, 1821, there, had, been, wars, which, saw, greeks, fight, against, the, ottomans, such, as, the, greek, participation, in, the, battle, of, lepanto, in, 1571, the, morean, war, of, 1684, 1699, and, the, russian, instigated, orlov, revolt, in, 1770, these, uprisings, were, put, down, by, the, ottomans, with, great, bloodshed, many, greeks, were, conscripted, as, ottoman, subjects, to, serve, in, the, ottoman, army, and, especially, the, navy, while, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, responsible, for, the, orthodox, remained, in, general, loyal, to, the, empire, in, the, 18th, century, greek, merchants, came, to, dominate, trade, within, the, ottoman, empire, established, communities, throughout, the, mediterranean, the, balkans, and, europe,
