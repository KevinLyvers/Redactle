of, davao, city, the, city, is, also, nicknamed, the, durian, capital, of, the, philippines, the, region, s, name, is, derived, from, its, bagobo, origins, who, are, indigenous, to, the, area, the,

inhabit, the, hinterlands, of, the, region, called, the, river, davah, with, a, gentle, vowel, ending, although, later, pronunciation, is, with, a, hard, v, or, b, the, clatta, or, giangan, diangan,

other, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, aeta, maguindanaon, and, the, tausug, davao, river, was, then, called, tagloc, river, by, the, bagobos, maguindanaons, and, tausugs, who, then, inhabited, a, settlement, near, the, mouth, of, the, river, to, the, sea, around, what, is, now, bolton, riverside, due, immediately, southwest, of, the, city, plaza, in, 1543, spanish, explorers, led, by, ruy, lopez, de, villalobos, sailing, around, mindanao, deliberately, avoided, the, area, around, davao, gulf, then, called, gulf, of, tagloc, due, to, the, danger, posed, by, fleets, of, moro, warships, operating, in, the, area, while, surveying, the, southeastern, coast, of, mindanao, for, possible, colonization, and, as, a, result, the, davao, gulf, area, remained, virtually, untouched, by, european, explorers, for, the, next, three, centuries, a, maguindanaon, datu, under, the, name, datu, bago, was, rewarded, the, territory, of, the, surroundings, of, davao, gulf, by, the, sultan, of, maguindanao, sultanate, for, joining, the, campaign, against, the, spanish, in, the, late, 1700s, from, his, ancestral, home, in, maguindanao, he, moved, to, the, area, in, 1800, and, having, convinced, bagobos, and, other, native, groups, in, the, area, to, his, side, conquered, the, entire, davao, gulf, area, having, consolidated, his, position, he, founded, the, fortress, of, pinagurasan, in, what, is, now, the, site, of, bangkerohan, public, market, in, 1830, which, served, as, his, capital, from, being, a, fortification, and, base, of, operations, from, which, datu, bago, could, gather, and, rally, his, forces, the, settlement, of, pinagurasan, eventually, grew, into, a, small, city, extending, from, present, day, generoso, bridge, in, bangkerohan, to, quezon, boulevard, more, than, a, kilometer, down, south, 172, 176, as, maguindanaons, and, bagobos, alike, among, other, nearby, tribes, in, the, area, flocked, into, the, settlement, eventually, becoming, the, main, trade, entrepot, in, the, davao, gulf, area, with, his, immense, overlordship, of, davao, gulf, datu, bago, was, eventually, crowned, sultan, by, his, subjects, at, his, capital, pinagurasan, in, 1843, effectively, making, his, realm, virtually, independent, from, the, sultanate, of, maguindanao, becoming, a, sultanate, with, sovereignty, over, davao, gulf, in, equal, standing, with, the, muslim, kingdoms, of, maguindanao, and, sulu, although, the, spaniards, began, to, explore, the, davao, gulf, area, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, spanish, influence, was, negligible, in, the, davao, region, until, 1842, when, the, spanish, governor, general, of, the, philippines, narciso, claver, a, ordered, the, colonization, of, the, davao, gulf, region, including, what, is, now, davao, city, for, the, spanish, crown, this, came, after, the, loss, of, their, colonies, in, the, americas, from, 1820s, to, 1830s, which, gravely, reduced, their, sources, of, revenue, to, the, point, that, the, royal, government, in, madrid, could, no, longer, continue, to, properly, provide, financial, support, to, what, remained, of, its, worldwide, colonies, thus, it, became, more, urgent, for, local, officials, in, the, colonies, including, the, philippines, to, find, ways, and, means, of, expanding, the, revenues, in, running, the, colonies, primarily, in, terms, of, tribute, extracted, from, the, natives, it, meant, that, for, the, first, time, the, spanish, colonial, government, in, the, philippines, was, compelled, to, embark, on, a, full, scale, conquest, of, mindanao, in, the, hopes, of, increasing, its, coffers, davao, gulf, seemed, to, be, a, tempting, target, among, spanish, military, circles, based, in, manila, for, its, thriving, maritime, trade, taking, place, there, their, initial, forays, began, with, their, incursion, on, the, village, of, sigaboy, in, 1842, from, which, the, local, spanish, officials, who, recently, landed, there, immediately, demanded, heavy, tribute, on, the, natives, who, then, asked, for, datu, bago, s, help, in, expelling, the, spaniards, which, he, responded, swiftly, by, sending, a, combined, naval, and, land, force, in, the, area, to, defeat, and, drive, out, the, spanish, force, there, the, spanish, seeing, datu, bago, as, a, mere, pirate, and, brigand, didn, t, take, the, threat, seriously, for, years, despite, his, numerous, victories, against, them, until, the, burning, of, the, spanish, trading, vessel, san, rufo, which, carried, a, letter, of, friendship, from, sultan, iskandar, qudaratullah, muhammad, zamal, al, azam, of, maguindanao, to, governor, general, claveria, and, its, massacre, of, all, its, crew, by, seaborne, corsairs, under, orders, from, datu, bago, himself, in, 1846, incensed, with, the, incident, the, spanish, secured, the, consent, from, the, sultan, of, maguindanao, who, finally, disowned, the, moros, of, davao, gulf, by, using, the, incident, as, pretext, for, justification, to, conquer, the, area, thus, the, official, spanish, colonization, of, davao, gulf, finally, began, in, earnest, in, april, 1848, when, an, expedition, of, 70, men, and, women, led, by, jos, cruz, de, oyanguren, of, vergara, spain, landed, on, the, estuary, of, the, davao, river, the, same, month, intent, on, conquering, pinagurasan, the, capital, of, datu, bago, s, domain, in, the, hopes, of, permanently, ending, the, menace, posed, on, spanish, vessels, by, moro, raiders, in, davao, gulf, being, the, strongest, chieftain, in, the, region, datu, bago, imposed, heavy, tribute, on, the, mandaya, tribes, nearby, therefore, also, making, him, the, most, loathed, chieftain, in, the, region, cruz, de, uyanguren, had, orders, from, the, higher, authorities, in, manila, to, colonize, the, davao, gulf, region, which, included, the, bagobo, settlement, on, the, northern, riverbank, in, return, he, asked, for, the, position, of, the, governor, of, the, conquered, area, and, the, monopoly, of, its, commerce, for, ten, years, at, this, juncture, a, mandaya, chieftain, named, datu, daupan, who, then, ruled, samal, island, came, to, him, seeking, for, an, alliance, against, datu, bago, the, two, chieftains, were, archrivals, and, cruz, de, uyanguren, took, advantage, of, it, initiating, an, alliance, between, spain, and, the, mandayas, of, samal, island, intent, on, taking, the, settlement, for, spain, he, and, his, men, accordingly, assaulted, it, but, the, bagobo, natives, fiercely, resisted, the, attacks, which, resulted, in, his, samal, mandaya, allies, to, desert, thus, a, three, month, long, inconclusive, battle, for, the, possession, of, the, settlement, ensued, which, was, only, decided, when, an, infantry, company, which, sailed, its, way, by, warships, from, zamboanga, came, in, as, reinforcements, thus, ensuring, the, takeover, of, the, settlement, and, its, surroundings, by, the, spaniards, while, the, defeated, bagobos, fled, further, inland, while, datu, bago, and, his, followers, fled, north, to, hijo, where, he, would, die, two, years, later, after, cruz, de, oyanguren, defeated, bago, and, conquered, pinagurasan, he, founded, the, town, of, nueva, vergara, the, future, davao, in, the, mangrove, swamps, of, what, is, now, bolton, riverside, on, june, 29, 1848, in, honor, of, his, home, in, spain, and, became, its, first, governor, pinagurasan, was, then, incorporated, into, the, new, town, almost, two, years, later, on, february, 29, 1850, the, province, of, nueva, guip, zcoa, was, established, via, a, royal, decree, with, the, newly, founded, town, as, the, capital, once, again, to, honor, his, homeland, in, spain, when, he, was, the, governor, of, the, province, however, his, plans, of, fostering, a, positive, economic, sway, on, the, region, backfired, which, resulted, in, his, eventual, replacement, under, orders, of, the, colonial, government, the, province, of, nueva, guipuzcoa, was, dissolved, on, july, 30, 1860, as, it, became, the, politico, military, commandery, of, davao, by, the, clamor, of, its, natives, a, petition, was, given, to, the, spanish, government, to, rename, nueva, vergara, into, davao, the, latter, being, the, name, used, by, the, natives, since, its, founding, it, was, eventually, accepted, in, 1867, and, nueva, vergara, was, given, its, present, name, davao, the, spanish, control, of, the, town, was, unstable, at, best, as, its, lumad, and, moro, natives, routinely, resisted, the, attempts, of, the, spanish, authorities, to, forcibly, resettle, them, and, convert, them, into, christianity, despite, all, these, such, were, all, done, with, the, goal, of, making, the, governance, of, the, area, easier, dividing, the, christians, both, settlers, and, native, converts, and, the, muslim, moros, into, several, religion, based, communities, within, the, town, as, the, philippine, revolution, having, been, fought, for, two, years, neared, its, end, in, 1898, the, expected, departure, of, the, spanish, authorities, in, davao, became, apparent, although, they, took, no, part, in, the, war, at, all, owing, to, the, lack, of, revolutionary, figures, in, the, area, save, for, a, negligible, pro, filipino, separatist, rebel, movement, in, the, town, of, santa, cruz, in, the, south, when, the, war, finally, ended, as, the, spanish, authorities, finally, left, the, town, two, davaoe, o, locals, by, the, names, of, pedro, layog, and, jose, m, lerma, represented, the, town, and, the, region, at, the, malolos, congress, of, 1898, therefore, indicating, davao, as, a, part, of, the, nascent, first, philippine, republic, the, period, of, filipino, revolutionary, control, of, davao, did, not, last, long, however, as, the, americans, landed, at, the, town, later, the, same, year, there, was, no, record, of, locals, offering, any, sort, of, resistance, to, the, americans, as, the, americans, began, their, administration, of, the, town, in, 1900, economic, opportunities, quickly, arose, as, huge, swathes, of, its, areas, mainly, lush, forests, and, fertile, grasslands, were, declared, open, for, agricultural, investment, as, a, result, foreign, businessmen, especially, japanese, entrepreneurs, started, settling, the, region, staking, their, claims, on, the, vast, lands, of, davao, and, turning, them, into, huge, coconut, and, banana, plantations, in, just, a, short, period, davao, changed, from, a, small, and, sparsely, inhabited, town, into, a, bustling, economic, center, serving, the, davao, gulf, region, heavily, populated, alongside, natives, by, tens, of, thousands, of, settlers, and, economic, migrants, from, luzon, visayas, and, japan, the, port, of, davao, was, established, and, opened, the, same, year, to, facilitate, the, international, export, of, agricultural, products, from, davao, davao, was, incorporated, as, a, part, of, moro, province, from, 1903, to, 1914, when, the, province, was, dissolved, in, 1914, it, led, to, the, establishment, of, davao, province, with, davao, as, its, provincial, capital, what, is, now, the, city, s, legislative, council, building, served, as, the, provincial, capitol, it, was, built, in, 1926, the, same, year, the, davao, municipal, hall, now, the, city, hall, was, constructed, because, of, the, rapidly, increasing, progress, of, the, town, on, march, 16, 1936, congressman, romualdo, quimpo, from, davao, filed, bill, 609, passed, as, commonwealth, act, 51, creating, the, city, of, davao, from, the, town, of, davao, and, the, municipal, district, of, guianga, the, bill, called, for, the, appointment, of, local, officials, by, the, president, by, that, time, the, new, city, was, already, mostly, populated, with, japanese, businessmen, and, settlers, who, then, became, its, locals, davao, was, inaugurated, as, a, charter, city, on, october, 16, 1936, by, president, manuel, l, quezon, the, charter, came, into, effect, on, march, 1, 1937, it, was, one, of, the, first, two, towns, in, mindanao, to, be, converted, into, a, city, the, other, being, zamboanga, on, december, 8, 1941, japanese, planes, bombed, the, harbor, and, from, december, 20, they, landed, forces, and, began, an, occupation, of, the, city, which, lasted, until, 1945, davao, was, among, the, earliest, to, be, occupied, by, japanese, forces, and, the, city, was, immediately, fortified, as, a, bastion, of, japanese, defense, under, the, brutal, japanese, regime, girls, teenagers, and, young, adults, were, kidnapped, by, japanese, soldiers, and, were, forced, into, becoming, sex, slaves, under, the, oppressive, comfort, women, system, where, the, victims, were, routinely, gang, raped, and, killed, korean, and, taiwanese, nationals, were, also, brought, by, the, japanese, to, davao, and, were, forced, into, becoming, sex, slaves, the, city, was, subjected, to, extensive, bombing, by, forces, led, by, douglas, macarthur, before, american, forces, landed, in, leyte, in, october, 1944, the, battle, of, davao, towards, the, end, of, world, war, ii, was, one, of, the, longest, and, bloodiest, battles, during, the, philippine, liberation, and, brought, tremendous, destruction, to, the, city, setting, back, the, economic, and, physical, strides, made, before, the, japanese, occupation, davao, regained, its, status, as, the, agricultural, and, economic, hub, of, mindanao, after, the, war, ended, in, 1945, wood, products, such, as, plywood, and, timber, and, more, agricultural, products, being, produced, within, the, city, such, as, copra, and, other, varieties, of, banana, became, available, for, export, some, japanese, locals, 80, percent, of, the, city, s, population, prior, to, the, war, s, end, assimilated, with, the, filipino, population, while, others, were, expelled, from, the, country, by, the, filipino, locals, due, to, recent, enmity, davao, was, peaceful, and, increasingly, progressive, in, the, postwar, period, including, the, 1950s, and, the, mid, 1960s, ethnic, tensions, were, minimal, and, there, was, essentially, no, presence, of, secessionists, groups, in, mindanao, in, 1967, the, province, of, davao, was, divided, into, three, provinces, davao, del, norte, davao, oriental, and, davao, del, sur, the, city, of, davao, became, part, of, davao, del, sur, no, longer, the, provincial, capital, it, became, a, commercial, center, of, southern, mindanao, this, period, also, saw, the, first, ever, election, of, an, indigenous, person, to, the, office, of, mayor, of, davao, city, when, elias, lopez, a, full, blooded, bagobo, won, the, mayoral, elections, of, 1967, by, the, late, 1960s, davao, had, become, the, regional, capital, of, southern, mindanao, with, the, reorganization, it, became, the, regional, capital, of, the, davao, region, region, xi, and, a, highly, urbanized, city, in, the, province, of, davao, del, sur, things, began, to, take, a, turn, for, the, worse, late, into, ferdinand, marcos, first, presidential, term, when, news, about, the, jabidah, massacre, ignited, a, furor, in, the, moro, community, and, ethnic, tensions, encouraged, with, the, formation, of, secessionist, movements, an, economic, crisis, in, late, 1969, led, to, social, unrest, and, violent, crackdowns, on, protests, led, to, the, radicalization, of, many, students, throughout, the, country, with, no, way, to, express, their, grievances, about, government, abuses, after, the, declaration, of, martial, law, in, 1972, many, of, them, joined, the, new, people, s, army, npa, bringing, the, communist, rebellion, in, the, philippines, to, davao, and, the, rest, of, mindanao, for, the, first, time, the, movement, would, continue, to, grow, over, the, next, decade, but, was, continuing, to, struggle, by, the, early, 1980s, convincing, prominent, party, thinker, and, idealogue, edgar, jopson, to, be, based, there, until, he, was, killed, after, a, raid, in, skyline, subdivision, in, september, 1982, the, years, immediately, after, jopson, s, death, saw, an, unmanageable, increase, in, the, communist, party, s, ranks, however, the, 1983, philippine, economic, nosedive, and, the, assassination, of, ninoy, aquino, a, few, months, later, saw, the, new, people, s, army, grow, to, seven, fronts, battalion, sized, units, which, coincided, with, a, decision, to, experiment, with, strategies, like, urban, insurrectionism, severe, violence, began, with, assassinations, of, corrupt, officials, and, policemen, but, mid, 1984, and, august, 1985, saw, 16, journalists, killed, where, only, six, had, been, killed, in, the, decade, between, 1975, and, 1984, agdao, the, poor, barangay, from, which, of, the, npa, got, much, of, its, support, began, to, be, known, as, nicaragdao, foreign, press, began, labelling, davao, the, philippines, murder, capital, and, killing, fields, while, the, npa, s, experiments, with, urban, insurrectionism, led, all, of, mindanao, to, be, labeled, the, laboratory, of, the, revolution, in, order, to, keep, its, large, number, of, cadres, supplied, the, npa, depended, heavily, on, local, citizens, for, supplies, increasing, the, incidences, of, abusive, behavior, and, reducing, support, for, their, cause, in, 1984, rightwing, vigilantes, with, the, support, of, philippine, constabulary, davao, city, metropolitan, command, commander, lt, colonel, franco, calida, formed, the, armed, group, alsa, masa, people, s, rise, to, counter, them, their, presence, coinciding, infighting, within, the, npa, triggered, by, a, hunt, for, deep, penetration, agents, was, perceived, as, reducing, npa, presence, in, davao, but, at, the, cost, of, the, alsa, masa, itself, committing, human, rights, violations, most, davao, residents, remained, staunchly, against, violence, from, either, extreme, early, examples, had, included, the, roman, catholic, archbishop, of, davao, antonio, l, mabutas, who, was, among, the, first, religious, leaders, to, peacefully, speak, out, against, the, human, rights, abuses, of, the, marcos, dictatorship, however, these, peaceful, citizens, lacked, the, political, clout, to, influence, the, situation, much, before, 1983, one, stabilizing, element, was, the, designation, of, then, colonel, rodolfo, biazon, as, commander, of, the, 3rd, marine, brigade, assigned, to, davao, in, what, the, international, press, dubbed, the, most, sophisticated, approach, to, addressing, the, insurgency, biazon, eschewed, the, aggressive, stance, preferred, by, the, philippine, constabulary, and, instead, focused, on, outreach, and, community, engagement, visiting, schools, and, communities, and, assuring, the, public, that, any, marine, would, be, disciplined, for, any, abuses, committed, ordinary, citizens, began, to, have, more, of, a, voice, for, change, after, the, economic, crisis, of, 1983, the, assassination, of, ninoy, aquino, and, the, murder, of, prominent, davao, city, journalist, alex, orcullo, at, a, checkpoint, in, barangay, tigatto, on, october, 19, 1984, these, seminal, events, prompted, prominent, city, figures, like, soledad, duterte, to, organize, a, protest, group, called, the, yellow, friday, movement, which, slowly, gained, support, until, 1986, when, marcos, was, finally, ousted, and, forced, into, exile, from, various, sectors, such, as, the, academe, there, were, other, ordinary, davaoe, os, are, honored, at, the, philippines, bantayog, ng, mga, bayani, which, honors, the,

prominent, human, rights, lawyer, with, the, free, legal, assistance, group, economics, professor, and, union, organizer, eduardo, lanzona, who, was, arrested, in, davao, del, norte, and, eventually, killed, by, marcos, forces, in, 1975, activist, maria, socorro, par, who, pushed, for, the, restoration, of, the, student, council, and, school, paper, atenews, in, the, mid70s, after, they, had,

the, local, leaders, of, the, time, were, closely, associated, with, marcos, they, were, removed, by, the, 1986, revolutionary, government, which, took, power, after, marcos, s, ouster, president, corazon, aquino, then, appointed, soledad, duterte, s, son, rodrigo, duterte, as, temporary, vice, mayor, of, davao, rodrigo, duterte, later, ran, for, mayor, of, davao, city, and, won, taking, the,
