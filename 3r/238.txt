the, aleut, islands, aleutic, islands, or, before, 1867, the, catherine, archipelago, are, a, chain, of, 14, main, larger, volcanic, islands, and, 55, smaller, ones, most, of, the, aleutian, islands, belong, to, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, with, the, archipelago, encompassing, the, aleutians, west, census, area, and, the, aleutians, east, borough, the, commander, islands, located, further, to, the, west, belong, to, the, russian, federal, subject, of, kamchatka, krai, of, the, russian, far, east, the, islands, form, part, of, the, aleutian, arc, of, the, northern, pacific, ocean, and, occupy, a, land, area, of, 6, 821, sq, mi, 17, 666, km, 2, that, extends, westward, roughly, 1, 200, mi, 1, 900, km, from, the, alaskan, peninsula, mainland, in, the, direction, of, the, kamchatka, peninsula, the, archipelago, acts, as, a, border, between, the, bering, sea, to, the, north, and, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, south, crossing, longitude, 180, at, which, point, east, and, west, longitude, end, the, archipelago, contains, both, the, westernmost, and, easternmost, parts, of, the, united, states, by, longitude, amatignak, island, and, semisopochnoi, island, respectively, the, westernmost, u, s, island, in, real, terms, however, is, attu, island, east, of, which, runs, the, international, date, line, the, aleutian, islands, with, their, 57, volcanoes, form, the, northernmost, part, of, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, physiographically, they, are, a, distinct, section, of, the, larger, pacific, border, province, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, larger, pacific, mountain, system, physiographic, division, the, islands, are, considered, to, be, among, the, most, geographically, isolated, areas, of, the, northern, pacific, battles, and, skirmishes, took, place, during, the, aleutian, islands, campaign, of, world, war, ii, the, japanese, landing, and, occupations, of, kiska, and, attu, in, june, of, 1942, were, one, of, only, two, invasions, of, the, united, states, in, north, america, during, wwii, the, philippines, guam, and, wake, atoll, part, of, the, marshall, islands, pacific, territories, of, the, united, states, were, also, invaded, motion, between, the, kula, plate, and, the, north, american, plate, along, the, margin, of, the, bering, shelf, in, the, bering, sea, north, of, the, aleutian, arc, ended, in, the, early, eocene, the, aleutian, basin, the, ocean, floor, north, of, the, aleutian, arc, is, the, remainder, of, the, kula, plate, that, was, trapped, when, volcanism, and, subduction, jumped, south, to, its, current, location, at, c, 56, ma, the, aleutian, island, arc, formed, in, the, early, eocene, 55, 50, ma, when, the, subduction, of, the, pacific, plate, under, the, north, american, plate, began, the, arc, is, made, of, separate, blocks, that, have, been, rotated, clockwise, the, basement, underlying, the, islands, is, made, of, three, stratigraphic, units, an, eocene, layer, of, volcanic, rock, an, oligocene, miocene, layer, of, marine, sedimentary, rock, and, a, pliocene, quaternary, layer, of, sedimentary, and, igneous, rock, the, islands, known, before, 1867, as, the, catherine, archipelago, include, six, groups, east, to, west, all, six, are, located, between, 51, and, 55, n, latitude, and, 172, e, and, 163, w, longitude, the, largest, islands, in, the, aleutians, are, attu, the, farthest, from, the, mainland, and, unalaska, umnak, and, unimak, in, the, fox, islands, the, largest, of, those, is, unimak, island, with, an, area, of, 1, 571, 41, mi, 2, 4, 069, 9, km, 2, followed, by, unalaska, island, the, only, other, aleutian, island, with, an, area, over, 1, 000, square, miles, 2, 600, km, 2, the, axis, of, the, archipelago, near, the, mainland, of, alaska, has, a, southwest, trend, but, at, tanaga, island, about, 178, w, its, direction, changes, to, the, northwest, this, change, of, direction, corresponds, to, a, curve, in, the, line, of, volcanic, fissures, that, have, contributed, their, products, to, the, building, of, the, islands, such, curved, chains, are, repeated, about, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, kuril, islands, the, japanese, chain, and, in, the, philippines, all, these, island, arcs, are, at, the, edge, of, the, pacific, plate, and, experience, much, seismic, activity, but, are, still, habitable, the, aleutians, lie, between, the, pacific, and, north, american, tectonic, plates, the, general, elevation, is, greatest, in, the, eastern, islands, and, least, in, the, western, the, island, chain, is, a, western, continuation, of, the, aleutian, range, on, the, mainland, the, great, majority, of, the, islands, bear, evident, marks, of, volcanic, origin, and, there, are, numerous, volcanic, cones, on, the, north, side, of, the, chain, some, of, them, active, many, of, the, islands, however, are, not, wholly, volcanic, but, contain, crystalline, or, sedimentary, rocks, and, also, amber, and, beds, of, lignite, the, coasts, are, rocky, and, surf, worn, and, the, approaches, are, exceedingly, dangerous, the, land, rising, immediately, from, the, coasts, to, steep, bold, mountains, these, volcanic, islands, reach, heights, of, 6, 200, feet, 1, 900, m, makushin, volcano, 5, 691, feet, 1, 735, m, on, unalaska, island, is, not, quite, visible, from, within, the, town, of, unalaska, though, the, steam, rising, from, its, cone, is, visible, on, a, rare, clear, day, residents, of, unalaska, need, only, to, climb, one, of, the, smaller, hills, in, the, area, such, as, pyramid, peak, or, mt, newhall, to, get, a, good, look, at, the, snow, covered, cone, the, volcanic, bogoslof, and, fire, islands, which, rose, from, the, sea, in, 1796, and, 1883, respectively, lie, about, 30, miles, 50, km, west, of, unalaska, bay, in, 1906, a, new, volcanic, cone, rose, between, the, islets, of, bogoslof, and, grewingk, near, unalaska, followed, by, another, in, 1907, these, cones, were, nearly, demolished, by, an, explosive, eruption, on, september, 1, 1907, in, 2017, the, volcanic, cone, erupted, sending, ash, and, ice, particles, 30, 000, feet, 9000, m, into, the, air, alfred, russel, wallace, s, 1879, book,

islands, with, the, oceania, region, due, to, their, status, as, remote, islands, in, the, pacific, the, islands, having, biogeographical, and, ethnocultural, affinities, to, north, america, are, not, ordinarily, considered, a, part, of, the, region, the, climate, of, the, islands, is, oceanic, with, moderate, and, fairly, uniform, temperatures, and, heavy, rainfall, fogs, are, almost, constant, summer, weather, is, much, cooler, than, southeast, alaska, around, sitka, but, the, winter, temperature, of, the, islands, and, of, the, alaska, panhandle, is, nearly, the, same, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, system, the, area, southwest, of, 53, 30, n, 167, 00, w, 53, 5, n, 167, 0, w, 53, 5, 167, 0, on, unalaska, island, has, a, subpolar, oceanic, climate, type, cfc, as, does, reykjav, k, t, rshavn, punta, arenas, ushuaia, and, the, auckland, islands, characterized, by, the, coldest, month, averaging, above, 0, c, 32, f, one, to, three, months, averaging, above, 10, c, 50, f, and, no, significant, precipitation, differences, between, seasons, to, the, northeast, of, that, point, the, climate, becomes, subarctic, with, cool, summers, and, year, around, rainfall, type, dfc, like, petropavlovsk, kamchatsky, murmansk, st, moritz, and, labrador, city, where, it, is, similar, albeit, colder, with, the, coldest, month, averaging, below, 0, c, 32, f, during, the, winter, the, islands, become, the, center, of, a, semi, permanent, low, pressure, area, called, the, aleutian, low, the, mean, annual, temperature, for, unalaska, the, most, populated, island, of, the, group, is, about, 38, f, 3, c, being, about, 30, f, 1, c, in, january, and, about, 52, f, 11, c, in, august, the, highest, and, lowest, temperatures, recorded, on, the, islands, were, 78, f, 26, c, and, 5, f, 15, c, respectively, the, average, amount, of, annual, rainfall, is, about, 80, inches, 2, 000, mm, unalaska, with, about, 250, rainy, days, per, year, is, said, to, be, one, of, the, rainiest, places, within, the, u, s, the, growing, season, lasts, approximately, 135, days, from, early, in, may, until, late, in, september, but, agriculture, is, limited, to, the, raising, of, few, vegetables, with, the, exception, of, some, stunted, willows, the, vast, majority, of, the, chain, is, devoid, of, native, trees, on, some, of, the, islands, such, as, adak, and, amaknak, there, are, a, few, coniferous, trees, growing, remnants, of, the, russian, period, while, tall, trees, grow, in, many, cold, climates, aleutian, conifers, some, estimated, to, be, two, hundred, years, old, rarely, reach, a, height, of, even, 10, feet, 3, m, and, many, of, them, are, still, less, than, 5, feet, 1, 5, m, tall, this, is, because, the, islands, much, like, the, falklands, and, other, islands, of, similar, latitudes, experience, such, strong, winds, that, taller, trees, are, vulnerable, to, snapping, off, instead, of, trees, the, islands, are, covered, with, a, luxuriant, dense, growth, of, herbage, and, shrubs, including, crowberry, bluejoint, grasses, sedges, and, many, flowering, plants, there, are, areas, of, peat, bog, near, the, coasts, endemic, plants, include, the, endangered, aleutian, shield, fern, there, is, currently, almost, no, naturally, occurring, forest, in, the, aleutian, islands, except, with, the, help, of, human, intervention, for, example, the, adak, forest, on, adak, island, is, a, man, made, tree, group, consisting, of, 33, trees, the, aleutians, are, home, to, many, large, colonies, of, seabirds, buldir, island, has, 21, breeding, seabird, species, including, the, bering, sea, endemic, red, legged, kittiwake, large, seabird, colonies, are, also, present, at, kiska, gareloi, semisopochnoi, bogoslof, and, others, the, islands, are, also, frequented, by, vagrant, asiatic, birds, including, the, common, rosefinch, siberian, rubythroat, bluethroat, lanceolated, warbler, and, the, first, north, american, record, of, the, intermediate, egret, the, habitats, of, the, aleutians, are, largely, unspoiled, but, wildlife, is, affected, by, competition, from, introduced, species, such, as, cattle, caribou, and, foxes, nearly, all, of, the, aleutians, are, protected, as, part, of, the, alaska, maritime, national, wildlife, refuge, and, the, aleutian, islands, wilderness, observations, have, identified, sea, otters, as, a, keystone, species, along, the, coasts, of, many, of, the, aleutian, islands, their, presence, encourages, the, growth, of, kelp, forests, as, the, otters, control, sea, urchin, populations, as, large, populations, of, sea, urchins, can, create, urchin, barrens, by, clearing, away, kelp, stands, on, the, less, mountainous, islands, the, raising, of, sheep, and, reindeer, was, once, believed, to, be, practicable, there, are, bison, on, islands, near, sand, point, sheep, raising, seems, to, have, died, off, with, the, advent, of, synthetic, fibers, which, lowered, the, value, of, wool, during, the, 1980s, there, were, some, llama, being, raised, on, unalaska, the, current, economy, is, primarily, based, on, fishing, and, the, presence, of, u, s, military, the, only, crop, is, potato, chickens, are, raised, in, barns, under, protection, from, the, cold, in, addition, to, a, partial, air, service, and, a, ferry, service, the, alaska, marine, highway, passes, through, many, of, the, u, s, islands, the, native, people, refer, to, themselves, as, unangan, and, are, now, generally, known, by, most, non, natives, as, the, aleut, the, aleut, language, is, one, of, the, two, main, branches, of, the, eskimo, aleut, language, family, this, family, is, not, known, to, be, related, to, any, others, the, 2000, u, s, census, recorded, a, population, of, 8, 162, on, the, islands, of, whom, 4, 283, were, living, in, the, main, settlement, of, unalaska, because, the, islands, stretch, like, a, broken, bridge, from, the, continent, asia, to, the, continent, north, america, many, anthropologists, hypothesize, they, were, a, route, of, the, first, human, occupants, of, the, americas, however, the, earliest, known, evidence, in, public, recorded, history, of, human, occupation, in, the, americas, is, found, much, farther, south, the, early, human, sites, in, the, bering, sea, were, probably, submerged, by, rising, waters, and, sand, during, the, current, interglacial, period, people, living, in, or, on, the, aleutian, islands, developed, skills, in, hunting, fishing, and, basketry, the, baskets, were, woven, with, shredded, stalks, of, beach, rye, explorers, traders, and, missionaries, arrived, from, russia, beginning, in, 1741, in, 1741, the, russian, government, sent, vitus, bering, a, dane, in, the, service, of, russia, and, aleksei, chirikov, a, russian, in, the, ships, saint, peter, and, saint, paul, on, a, voyage, of, discovery, in, the, northern, pacific, after, the, ships, were, separated, by, a, storm, chirikov, discovered, several, eastern, islands, of, the, aleutian, group, and, bering, discovered, several, of, the, western, islands, bering, was, shipwrecked, and, died, in, the, komandorski, islands, commander, islands, one, of, which, now, bears, his, name, bering, island, along, with, the, surrounding, bering, sea, the, survivors, of, bering, s, party, reached, the, kamchatka, peninsula, in, a, boat, constructed, from, the, wreckage, of, their, ship, and, reported, the, islands, were, rich, in, fur, bearing, animals, siberian, fur, hunters, flocked, to, the, commander, islands, and, gradually, moved, eastward, across, the, aleutian, islands, to, the, mainland, in, this, manner, russia, gained, a, foothold, on, the, northwestern, coast, of, north, america, the, aleutian, islands, consequently, belonged, to, russia, until, that, country, transferred, all, its, possessions, in, north, america, to, the, u, s, in, 1867, during, the, consolidation, of, the, russian, american, company, there, was, sporadic, conflict, with, the, native, population, frequently, disastrous, to, the, poorly, armed, and, vastly, outnumbered, russians, the, colonies, soon, entered, a, relatively, stable, state, based, on, cooperation, intermarriage, and, official, policies, that, provided, social, status, education, and, professional, training, to, children, of, mixed, aleut, russian, birth, within, a, generation, the, day, to, day, administration, of, the, russian, american, colonies, was, largely, in, the, hands, of, native, born, alaskans, reversing, the, usual, trend, in, colonization, where, indigenous, technologies, are, replaced, the, russians, adopted, the, aleut, kayak, or, baidarka, sea, otter, hunting, techniques, and, the, working, of, native, copper, deposits, the, russians, instituted, public, education, preservation, of, the, aleut, language, through, transliteration, of, religious, and, other, texts, into, aleut, via, an, adaptation, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, vaccination, of, the, native, population, against, smallpox, and, science, based, sea, mammal, conservation, policies, that, were, ahead, of, their, time, by, 1760, the, russian, merchant, andrian, tolstykh, had, made, a, detailed, census, in, the, vicinity, of, adak, and, extended, russian, citizenship, to, the, aleuts, during, his, third, and, last, voyage, in, 1778, captain, james, cook, surveyed, the, eastern, portion, of, the, aleutian, archipelago, accurately, determined, the, position, of, some, of, the, more, important, islands, and, corrected, many, errors, of, former, navigators, among, the, first, christian, missionaries, to, arrive, in, the, aleutian, islands, was, a, party, of, ten, russian, orthodox, monks, and, priests, who, arrived, in, 1793, within, two, years, a, monk, named, herman, was, the, only, survivor, of, that, party, he, settled, on, spruce, island, near, kodiak, island, and, often, defended, the, rights, of, the, aleuts, against, the, russian, trading, companies, he, is, now, known, in, the, orthodox, church, as, saint, herman, of, alaska, another, early, christian, missionary, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, was, father, veniaminov, who, arrived, in, unalaska, in, 1824, he, was, named, bishop, innokentii, in, 1840, and, moved, to, sitka, he, is, now, known, in, the, orthodox, church, as, saint, innocent, of, alaska, the, principal, settlements, were, on, unalaska, island, the, oldest, was, iliuliuk, also, called, unalaska, settled, in, 1760, 1775, with, a, customs, house, and, an, orthodox, church, after, the, american, purchase, of, alaska, from, russia, in, 1867, further, development, took, place, new, buildings, included, a, methodist, mission, and, orphanage, and, the, headquarters, for, a, considerable, fleet, of, united, states, revenue, cutters, which, patrolled, the, sealing, grounds, of, the, pribilof, islands, the, first, public, school, in, unalaska, opened, in, 1883, the, u, s, congress, extended, american, citizenship, to, all, native, americans, and, this, law, has, been, held, to, include, the, indigenous, peoples, of, alaska, in, 1924, a, hospital, was, built, in, unalaska, in, 1933, by, the, u, s, bureau, of, indian, affairs, during, world, war, ii, in, what, were, the, only, two, invasions, of, the, united, states, during, the, war, small, parts, of, the, aleutian, islands, were, occupied, by, japanese, forces, when, attu, and, kiska, were, invaded, possibly, to, divert, american, forces, away, from, the, main, japanese, attack, at, midway, atoll, the, u, s, navy, having, broken, the, japanese, naval, codes, proceeded, as, if, this, was, just, a, diversion, and, it, did, not, expend, large, amounts, of, effort, in, defending, the, islands, more, than, 90, americans, were, taken, to, japan, as, prisoners, of, war, most, of, the, civilian, population, over, 800, of, the, aleutians, and, pribilovians, were, detained, by, the, united, states, in, camps, in, the, alaska, panhandle, during, the, aleutian, islands, campaign, american, forces, invaded, japanese, held, attu, and, defeated, the, japanese, american, and, canadian, troops, later, launched, an, invasion, of, kiska, in, which, 34, 426, men, composed, of, both, americans, and, canadian, participated, however, japanese, forces, had, already, withdrawn, ending, the, campaign, in, the, islands, the, invasion, was, an, embarrassment, for, the, allied, forces, as, the, entire, japanese, force, of, 5, 183, men, had, left, the, island, on, july, 28, without, the, americans, noticing, however, the, americans, suffered, significant, casualties, during, their, invasion, 313, men, died, as, a, result, of, accidents, with, many, dying, due, to, accidental, fire, president, roosevelt, visited, adak, in, 1944, meeting, with, commanders, and, eating, with, soldiers, of, the, garrison, this, was, his, first, and, only, trip, to, the, aleutian, islands, and, alaska, as, a, whole, a, rumor, spread, that, fdr, had,
