the, yukon, river, is, a, major, watercourse, of, northwestern, north, america, from, its, source, in, british, columbia, it, flows, through, canada, s, territory, of, yukon, itself, named, after, the, river, the, lower, half, of, the, river, continues, westward, through, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, the, river, is, 3, 190, kilometres, 1, 980, mi, long, and, empties, into, the, bering, sea, at, the, yukon, kuskokwim, delta, the, average, flow, is, 6, 400, 7, 000, m, 3, s, 230, 000, 250, 000, cu, ft, s, the, total, drainage, area, is, 854, 700, km, 2, 330, 000, sq, mi, of, which, 323, 800, km, 2, 125, 000, sq, mi, lies, in, canada, the, total, area, is, more, than, 25, larger, than, texas, or, alberta, the, longest, river, in, alaska, and, yukon, it, was, one, of, the, principal, means, of, transportation, during, the, 1896, 1903, klondike, gold, rush, a, portion, of, the, river, in, yukon, the, thirty, mile, section, from, lake, laberge, to, the, teslin, river, is, a, national, heritage, river, and, a, unit, of, klondike, gold, rush, international, historical, park, paddle, wheel, riverboats, continued, to, ply, the, river, until, the, 1950s, when, the, klondike, highway, was, completed, after, the, purchase, of, alaska, by, the, united, states, in, 1867, the, alaska, commercial, company, acquired, the, assets, of, the, russian, american, company, and, constructed, several, posts, at, various, locations, on, the, yukon, river, the, yukon, river, has, a, recent, history, of, pollution, from, military, installations, dumps, wastewater, and, other, sources, however, the, environmental, protection, agency, does, not, list, the, yukon, river, among, its, impaired, watersheds, and, water, quality, data, from, the, u, s, geological, survey, shows, relatively, good, levels, of, turbidity, metals, and, dissolved, oxygen, the, yukon, and, mackenzie, rivers, have, much, higher, suspended, sediment, concentrations, than, the, great, siberian, arctic, rivers, the, yukon, river, inter, tribal, watershed, council, a, cooperative, effort, of, 70, first, nations, and, tribes, in, alaska, and, canada, has, the, goal, of, making, the, river, and, its, tributaries, safe, to, drink, from, again, by, supplementing, and, scrutinizing, government, data, the, name, yukon, or, g, han, is, a, contraction, of, the, words, in, the, gwich, in, phrase, ch, g, han, which, means, white, water, river, and, refers, to, the, pale, colour, of, glacial, runoff, in, the, yukon, river, the, contraction, is, g, han, if, the, remains, nasalized, or, yuk, han, if, there, is, no, vowel, nasalization, in, the, 1840s, different, tribes, had, different, opinions, as, to, the, literal, meaning, of, yukon, in, 1843, the, holikachuks, had, told, the, russian, american, company, that, their, name, for, the, river, was, yukkhana, and, that, this, name, meant, big, river, however, yukkhana, does, not, literally, correspond, to, a, holikachuk, phrase, that, means, big, river, then, two, years, later, the, gwich, ins, told, the, hudson, s, bay, company, that, their, name, for, the, river, was, yukon, and, that, the, name, meant, white, water, river, white, water, river, in, fact, corresponds, to, gwich, in, words, that, can, be, shortened, to, form, yukon, because, the, holikachuks, had, been, trading, regularly, with, both, the, gwich, ins, and, the, yup, iks, the, holikachuks, were, in, a, position, to, borrow, the, gwich, in, contraction, and, to, conflate, its, meaning, with, the, meaning, of, kuig, pak, which, is, the, yup, ik, name, for, the, same, river, for, that, reason, the, documentary, evidence, suggests, that, the, holikachuks, had, borrowed, the, contraction, g, han, from, gwich, in, and, erroneously, assumed, that, this, contraction, had, the, same, literal, meaning, as, the, corresponding, yup, ik, name, kuig, pak, the, lewes, river, is, the, former, name, of, the, upper, course, of, the, yukon, from, marsh, lake, to, the, confluence, of, the, pelly, river, at, fort, selkirk, the, generally, accepted, source, of, the, yukon, river, is, the, llewellyn, glacier, at, the, southern, end, of, atlin, lake, in, british, columbia, others, suggest, that, the, source, is, lake, lindeman, at, the, northern, end, of, the, chilkoot, trail, either, way, atlin, lake, flows, into, tagish, lake, via, the, atlin, river, as, eventually, does, lake, lindeman, after, flowing, into, bennett, lake, tagish, lake, then, flows, into, marsh, lake, via, the, tagish, river, the, yukon, river, proper, starts, at, the, northern, end, of, marsh, lake, just, south, of, whitehorse, some, argue, that, the, source, of, the, yukon, river, should, really, be, teslin, lake, and, the, teslin, river, which, has, a, larger, flow, when, it, reaches, the, yukon, at, hootalinqua, the, upper, end, of, the, yukon, river, was, originally, known, as, the, lewes, river, until, it, was, established, that, it, actually, was, the, yukon, north, of, whitehorse, the, yukon, river, widens, into, lake, laberge, made, famous, by, robert, w, service, s, the, cremation, of, sam, mcgee, other, large, lakes, that, are, part, of, the, yukon, river, system, include, kusawa, lake, into, the, takhini, river, and, kluane, lake, into, the, kluane, and, then, white, river, the, river, passes, through, the, communities, of, whitehorse, carmacks, just, before, the, five, finger, rapids, and, dawson, city, in, yukon, and, crossing, alaska, into, eagle, circle, fort, yukon, stevens, village, rampart, tanana, ruby, galena, nulato, grayling, holy, cross, russian, mission, marshall, pilot, station, st, marys, which, is, accessible, from, the, yukon, at, pitkas, point, and, mountain, village, after, mountain, village, the, main, yukon, channel, frays, into, many, channels, sprawling, across, the, delta, there, are, a, number, of, communities, after, the, head, of, passes, as, the, channel, division, is, called, locally, nunum, iqua, alakanuk, emmonak, and, kotlik, of, those, delta, communities, emmonak, is, the, largest, with, roughly, 760, people, in, the, 2000, census, emmonak, s, gravel, airstrip, is, the, regional, hub, for, flights, navigational, obstacles, on, the, yukon, river, are, the, five, finger, rapids, and, rink, rapids, downstream, from, carmacks, despite, its, length, there, are, only, four, vehicle, carrying, bridges, across, the, river, listed, from, upstream, to, downstream, a, car, ferry, crosses, the, river, at, dawson, city, in, the, summer, it, is, replaced, by, an, ice, bridge, over, the, frozen, river, during, the, winter, plans, to, build, a, permanent, bridge, were, announced, in, march, 2004, although, they, are, currently, on, hold, because, bids, came, in, much, higher, than, budgeted, there, are, also, two, pedestrian, only, bridges, in, whitehorse, as, well, as, a, dam, across, the, river, and, a, hydroelectric, generating, station, the, construction, of, the, dam, flooded, the, white, horse, rapids, which, gave, the, city, its, name, and, created, schwatka, lake, transportation, is, also, performed, along, the, river, in, summer, by, barge, enabling, heavy, goods, oil, and, vehicles, to, be, transported, to, communities, along, the, yukon, tanana, innoko, and, koyukuk, rivers, this, service, is, performed, by, ruby, marine, and, reaches, tanana, on, the, yukon, river, and, nenana, on, the, tanana, river, some, of, the, upper, slopes, of, this, watershed, e, g, nulato, hills, are, forested, by, black, spruce, this, locale, near, the, seward, peninsula, represents, the, near, westernmost, limit, of, the, black, spruce, picea, mariana, one, of, the, most, widespread, conifers, in, northern, north, america, the, river, flows, into, several, parklands, and, refuges, including, yukon, at, pilot, station, 121, miles, upstream, of, mouth, minimum, average, and, maximum, discharge, for, statistical, calculation, the, yukon, river, is, home, to, one, of, the, longest, salmon, runs, in, the, world, each, year, chinook, coho, and, chum, salmon, return, to, their, terminal, streams, in, alaska, the, yukon, territory, and, british, columbia, as, salmon, do, not, eat, during, their, spawning, migration, yukon, river, salmon, must, have, great, reserves, of, fat, and, energy, to, fuel, their, thousands, mile, long, journey, the, chinook, which, arrive, at, the, mouth, of, the, yukon, river, in, early, june, have, the, longest, journey, as, many, as, 2, 000, miles, against, the, current, with, an, estimated, 35, 50, bound, for, canada, as, a, result, chinook, salmon, are, noted, for, their, especially, rich, and, fatty, meat, and, are, the, priciest, of, all, pacific, salmon, species, the, villages, along, the, yukon, have, historically, relied, on, and, continue, to, rely, on, salmon, for, their, cultural, subsistence, and, commercial, needs, salmon, are, traditionally, dried, smoked, and, frozen, for, both, human, and, sled, dog, consumption, common, methods, of, fishing, on, the, yukon, include, set, gillnets, drift, nets, dip, nets, and, fish, wheels, the, preference, of, certain, gear, is, largely, dependent, on, the, river, s, varied, characteristics, in, different, areas, some, parts, of, the, river, do, not, have, eddies, to, make, set, nets, successful, whereas, in, other, places, the, tributaries, are, small, enough, to, make, drifting, impractical, over, the, last, 20, years, salmon, recruitment, the, number, of, returning, adults, has, taken, several, shocks, the, late, 1980s, 1990s, and, 2000s, have, been, marked, by, radically, reduced, runs, for, various, salmon, species, in, the, summer, of, 2023, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, counted, 58, 500, chinook, salmon, the, second, lowest, season, on, record, the, united, states, department, of, commerce, issued, a, federal, disaster, declaration, for, the, 2008, and, 2009, commercial, chinook, yukon, river, fisheries, calling, for, the, complete, closure, of, commercial, fishing, along, with, restrictions, on, subsistence, fishing, the, root, cause, of, these, poor, returns, remains, debated, with, questions, about, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, ocean, food, supply, disease, prevalence, in, returning, adults, the, methods, of, fishing, used, on, the, river, and, the, effects, of, the, bering, sea, pollock, trawl, fleet, on, food, supply, and, salmon, bycatch, in, 2010, the, alaska, department, of, fish, game, s, board, of, fisheries, issued, the, first, ever, restriction, for, net, mesh, size, on, the, yukon, reducing, it, to, 7, 5, inches, 190, mm, in, 2021, the, alaska, department, of, fish, game, s, division, of, commercial, fisheries, banned, all, fishing, of, chinook, and, chum, salmon, including, for, subsistence, various, organizations, are, involved, to, protect, healthy, salmon, runs, into, the, future, the, yukon, river, drainage, fisheries, association, was, formed, in, 1990, by, a, consensus, of, fishers, representing, the, entire, drainage, in, response, to, recent, disaster, years, its, organizational, goals, include, giving, voice, to, the, village, fishers, that, have, traditionally, managed, these, resources, enabling, communication, between, fishers, and, fishery, managers, and, helping, to, preserve, the, ecological, integrity, of, salmon, runs, and, local, cultures, traditional, ecological, knowledge, in, march, 2001, the, u, s, canadian, governments, passed, the, yukon, river, salmon, agreement, to, better, manage, an, internationally, shared, resource, and, ensure, that, more, canadian, originated, salmon, return, across, the, border, the, agreement, is, implemented, through, the, yukon, river, panel, an, international, body, of, 12, members, equal, parts, american, and, canadian, that, advises, managers, of, yukon, river, fisheries, concerning, restoration, conservation, and, coordinated, management,
