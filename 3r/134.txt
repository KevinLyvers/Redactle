border, of, china, and, the, soviet, union, the, first, written, mention, of, the, yenisei, river, dates, back, to, the, 7th, century, in, tang, dynasty, china, at, the, time, of, contact, with, yenisei, kyrgyz, of, this, region, the, word, jian, shui, jian, river, appears, in, book, of, zhou, vol, 50, and, history, of, the, northern, dynasties, vol, 99, while, jian, he, jian, river, appears, in, new, book, of, tang, vol, 217, in, addition, qian, he, qian, river, is, found, in, the, 14th, century, history, of, yuan, vol, 63, these, contacts, were, made, by, the, chinese, as, they, approached, the, upper, yenisei, river, from, the, south, the, characters, jian, or, jian, and, qian, have, been, compared, to, k, m, in, orkhon, inscriptions, from, the, 8th, century, the, term, kem, is, also, found, in, the, 13th, 14th, century, oirat, biography, in, jami, al, tawarikh, the, etymology, of, k, m, is, not, believed, to, be, of, turkic, origin, and, although, a, samoyed, derivation, has, been, proposed, its, precise, origins, remain, unclear, today, the, word, survives, only, in, sayan, turkic, languages, in, tuvan, as, xem, meaning, river, and, in, its, sister, language, tofa, as, hem, h, also, meaning, river, these, languages, are, considered, to, have, had, close, contact, with, those, mentioned, above, in, ancient, times, additionally, there, are, just, over, 50, river, names, containing, the, suffix, kem, in, the, altai, republic, and, the, term, kim, as, in, kim, su, meaning, yenisei, river, barely, exists, in, khakas, all, of, these, instances, are, confined, to, the, region, in, and, around, the, present, day, republic, of, tuva, meanwhile, in, the, 17th, century, russians, reached, the, lower, part, of, the, yenisei, river, from, the, northwest, by, 1600, the, tobolsk, cossacks, built, fort, mangazeya, by, the, taz, river, it, is, believed, that, the, name, of, the, yenisei, river, was, transmitted, either, directly, or, indirectly, from, samoyed, speaking, peoples, in, the, region, with, whom, the, russians, had, contact, this, contact, eventually, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, name, yenisei, with, a, russian, accent, additionally, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, yenisei, river, was, already, known, to, dutch, navigators, who, referred, to, it, as, gilissi, gelissi, or, geniscea, among, other, names, although, the, exact, spelling, varied, these, are, phonetically, similar, to, yenisei, in, particular, the, modern, dutch, pronunciation, of, geniscea, as, is, quite, close, to, yenisei, the, term, yenisei, appeared, in, russian, literature, slightly, later, around, 1600, in, the, form, that, is, still, used, today, unlike, in, dutch, the, russian, spelling, has, been, relatively, stable, since, the, 17th, century, with, only, minor, variations, such, as, yeniseya, or, yenisya, the, etymology, of, yenisei, remains, unclear, renowned, linguist, max, vasmer, for, instance, has, suggested, that, the, nganasan, word, jentajea, the, enets, jeddosi, and, the, selkup, n, andesi, all, meaning, yenisei, river, might, correspond, to, unidentified, samoyed, languages, v, k, nikonov, has, proposed, that, the, word, could, derive, from, iondessi, meaning, big, river, in, selkup, khanty, or, even, evenki, more, recently, some, have, speculated, that, yenisei, is, a, compound, word, of, old, kyrgyz, ene, meaning, great, grandmother, nanny, say, meaning, gravel, ford, however, the, above, considerations, remain, speculative, false, etymologies, as, they, do, not, refer, to, the, dictionaries, of, the, respective, languages, researchers, are, encouraged, to, conduct, more, detailed, studies, based, on, proper, contemporary, linguistic, sources, and, historical, documents, studies, have, shown, that, the, yenisey, suffers, from, contamination, caused, by, radioactive, discharges, from, a, factory, that, produced, bomb, grade, plutonium, in, the, secret, city, of, krasnoyarsk, 26, now, known, as,
