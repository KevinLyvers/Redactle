the, gulf, of, california, spanish, golfo, de, california, also, known, as, the, sea, of, cort, s, mar, de, cort, s, or, sea, of, cortez, or, less, commonly, as, the, vermilion, sea, mar, vermejo, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, pacific, ocean, that, separates, the, baja, california, peninsula, from, the, mexican, mainland, it, is, bordered, by, the, states, of, baja, california, baja, california, sur, sonora, and, sinaloa, with, a, coastline, of, approximately, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, rivers, that, flow, into, the, gulf, of, california, include, the, colorado, fuerte, mayo, sinaloa, sonora, and, the, yaqui, the, surface, of, the, gulf, is, about, 160, 000, km, 2, 62, 000, sq, mi, maximum, depths, exceed, 3, 000, meters, 9, 800, ft, because, of, the, complex, geology, linked, to, plate, tectonics, the, gulf, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, most, diverse, seas, on, earth, and, is, home, to, more, than, 5, 000, species, of, micro, invertebrates, parts, of, the, gulf, of, california, are, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, marine, expeditions, of, fort, n, xim, nez, hern, n, cort, s, juan, rodr, guez, cabrillo, francisco, de, ulloa, hernando, de, alarc, n, captain, francisco, de, lucenilla, and, sebasti, n, vizca, no, document, its, earliest, record, juan, de, o, ate, reached, the, gulf, overland, in, 1605, by, following, the, colorado, river, in, the, 19th, century, duflot, de, mofras, of, france, and, c, h, gilbert, of, the, united, states, fish, commission, visited, the, area, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, southern, limit, of, the, gulf, as, a, line, joining, piaxtla, point, latitude, 23, 38, n, on, the, west, coast, of, the, mainland, of, mexico, and, the, southern, extreme, of, lower, california, the, gulf, is, 1, 126, km, 700, mi, long, and, 48, 241, km, 30, 150, mi, wide, with, an, area, of, 177, 000, km, 2, 68, 000, sq, mi, a, mean, depth, of, 818, 08, m, 2, 684, 0, ft, and, a, volume, of, 145, 000, km, 3, 35, 000, cu, mi, the, gulf, of, california, is, divided, into, three, faunal, regions, northern, central, and, southern, one, recognized, transition, zone, is, termed, the, southwestern, baja, california, peninsula, transition, zones, exist, between, faunal, regions, and, they, usually, vary, for, each, individual, species, faunal, regions, are, distinguishable, based, on, the, specific, types, of, animals, found, there, geologic, evidence, is, widely, interpreted, by, geologists, as, indicating, the, gulf, came, into, being, around, 5, 3, million, years, ago, as, tectonic, forces, rifted, the, baja, california, peninsula, off, the, north, american, plate, as, part, of, this, process, the, east, pacific, rise, propagated, up, the, middle, of, the, gulf, along, the, seabed, this, extension, of, the, east, pacific, rise, is, often, referred, to, as, the, gulf, of, california, rift, zone, the, gulf, would, extend, as, far, as, indio, california, except, for, the, tremendous, delta, created, by, the, colorado, river, this, delta, blocks, the, sea, from, flooding, the, mexicali, and, imperial, valleys, volcanism, dominates, the, east, pacific, rise, the, island, of, isla, tortuga, is, one, example, of, this, ongoing, volcanic, activity, furthermore, hydrothermal, vents, due, to, extension, tectonic, regime, related, to, the, opening, of, the, gulf, are, found, in, the, bah, a, de, concepci, n, baja, california, sur, the, gulf, contains, 37, major, islands, the, two, largest, being, isla, ngel, de, la, guarda, and, isla, tibur, n, most, of, the, islands, are, found, on, the, west, side, of, the, gulf, in, fact, many, of, the, islands, of, the, gulf, are, the, result, of, volcanic, eruptions, that, occurred, during, the, early, history, of, baja, california, the, islands, of, islas, mar, as, islas, san, francisco, and, isla, partida, are, thought, to, be, the, result, of, such, eruptions, the, formations, of, the, islands, however, are, not, dependent, on, each, other, they, were, each, formed, as, a, result, of, an, individual, structural, occurrence, several, islands, including, isla, coronados, are, home, to, volcanoes, the, gulf, has, more, than, 900, islets, and, islands, which, together, total, about, 420, hectares, all, of, them, as, a, whole, were, enacted, as, area, reserve, and, migratory, bird, refuge, and, wildlife, on, august, 2, 1978, in, june, 2000, the, islands, were, designated, a, flora, and, fauna, protection, area, in, addition, to, this, effort, by, the, mexican, government, for, its, importance, and, recognition, worldwide, all, islands, in, the, gulf, are, also, part, of, the, international, program, man, and, biosphere, mab, and, are, part, of, the, world, reserve, network, unesco, biosphere, as, special, biosphere, reserve, because, of, the, vast, expanse, covered, by, this, federal, protected, area, conservation, and, management, is, carried, out, through, a, system, of, four, regional, directorates, one, per, state, bordering, the, gulf, of, california, the, work, of, direct, and, indirect, conservation, done, in, the, islands, is, governed, by, a, single, management, program, published, in, 2000, which, is, complemented, by, local, and, specific, management, programs, the, directorate, of, protection, area, wildlife, california, gulf, islands, in, baja, california, is, responsible, for, 56, islands, located, off, the, coast, of, the, state, these, are, grouped, into, four, archipelagos, san, luis, gonzaga, or, enchanted, guardian, angel, bah, a, de, los, ngeles, and, san, lorenzo, the, three, general, types, of, shores, found, in, the, gulf, include, rocky, shore, sandy, beach, and, tidal, flat, some, of, the, rich, biodiversity, and, high, endemism, that, characterize, the, gulf, and, make, it, such, a, hotspot, for, fishing, can, be, attributed, to, seemingly, insignificant, factors, such, as, the, types, of, rocks, that, make, up, a, shore, beaches, with, softer, more, porous, rocks, such, as, coquina, limestone, rhyolites, granite, or, diorite, generally, have, a, higher, species, richness, than, those, with, harder, smoother, rocks, such, as, basalt, or, diabase, porous, rocks, will, naturally, have, more, cracks, and, crevices, in, them, making, them, ideal, living, spaces, for, many, animals, the, rocks, themselves, however, generally, need, to, be, stable, on, the, shore, for, a, habitat, to, be, stable, additionally, the, color, of, the, rocks, can, affect, the, organisms, living, on, a, shore, for, example, darker, rocks, will, be, significantly, warmer, than, lighter, ones, and, can, deter, animals, that, do, not, have, a, high, tolerance, for, heat, the, northern, gulf, experiences, tidal, ranges, of, up, to, 5, m, 16, ft, mixed, semidiurnal, tides, are, the, norm, throughout, most, of, the, gulf, there, are, a, number, of, negative, estuaries, that, is, ones, in, which, the, evaporation, of, seawater, is, relatively, greater, than, that, of, the, fresh, water, input, the, salinities, of, these, inlets, are, higher, than, that, of, the, ocean, the, temperatures, poikilothermal, of, these, negative, estuaries, also, are, higher, than, the, general, temperature, of, the, gulf, it, is, possible, that, at, one, time, these, estuaries, were, positive, that, is, ones, in, which, the, seawater, component, is, diluted, therefore, the, water, is, brackish, with, salinity, less, than, that, of, the, ocean, however, because, of, human, settlement, around, the, gulf, and, water, diversion, for, municipal, and, agricultural, use, in, an, area, of, comparatively, low, rainfall, there, are, no, longer, many, rivers, that, freely, empty, into, the, gulf, the, upper, colorado, river, delta, is, one, example, of, a, historically, major, estuary, and, wetlands, ecosystem, that, since, the, 20th, century, construction, of, upriver, dams, and, diversion, aqueducts, on, the, colorado, river, is, now, a, small, ephemeral, remnant, estuary, the, remaining, gulf, inlets, still, are, important, to, several, species, of, fishes, crustaceans, and, shellfish, that, are, commercially, harvested, even, though, the, shores, of, the, gulf, are, generally, sheltered, from, the, continuous, wave, shock, that, is, experienced, by, most, other, north, american, shores, storms, known, as, a, chubasco, can, cause, significant, damage, to, shorelines, despite, their, brevity, the, depth, of, the, water, helps, to, determine, its, temperature, for, example, shallow, depths, are, directly, influenced, by, the, local, temperature, of, the, air, while, deeper, waters, are, less, susceptible, to, changes, in, air, temperature, the, temperature, of, the, water, in, the, gulf, generally, experiences, lows, of, 16, c, 61, f, in, winter, and, highs, of, 24, c, 75, f, in, summer, but, temperatures, can, vary, greatly, in, the, gulf, and, the, water, is, almost, always, warmer, by, the, coast, than, the, open, ocean, for, example, the, waters, surrounding, la, paz, reach, 30, c, 86, f, in, august, while, the, waters, in, neighboring, city, cabo, san, lucas, only, reach, 26, c, 79, f, occasionally, the, northern, gulf, will, go, through, significantly, cold, winters, the, water, in, the, northern, gulf, can, sometimes, drop, below, 8, c, 46, f, which, can, lead, to, a, large, die, off, of, marine, organisms, the, animals, most, susceptible, to, the, large, decrease, in, water, temperature, include, macroscopic, algae, and, plankton, 63, f, 61, f, 63, f, 66, f, 70, f, 73, f, 79, f, 82, f, 82, f, 79, f, 73, f, 66, f, 66, f, 66, f, 70, f, 73, f, 77, f, 81, f, 82, f, 85, f, 82, f, 81, f, 75, f, 70, f, 68, f, 66, f, 66, f, 66, f, 68, f, 70, f, 75, f, 79, f, 79, f, 79, f, 75, f, 72, f, the, narrow, sea, is, home, to, a, rich, ecosystem, in, addition, to, a, wide, range, of, endemic, creatures, such, as, the, critically, endangered, vaquita, it, hosts, many, migratory, species, such, as, the, humpback, whale, california, gray, whale, killer, whale, manta, ray, humboldt, squid, and, leatherback, sea, turtle, and, the, world, s, largest, animal, the, blue, whale, the, unusual, resident, populations, of, fin, whales, and, sperm, whales, do, not, migrate, annually, the, area, near, the, colorado, river, delta, has, a, small, remnant, population, of, totoaba, this, region, has, historically, been, a, magnet, for, world, class, sport, fishing, activities, with, a, rich, history, of, sporting, world, records, the, region, also, has, a, rich, history, as, a, commercial, fishery, however, the, data, vary, wildly, according, to, the, species, being, studied, and, the, gulf, s, ability, to, recuperate, after, years, of, overfishing, remains, uncertain, moreover, changes, in, terrestrial, ecology, such, as, the, vast, reduction, in, flow, from, the, colorado, river, into, the, gulf, have, negatively, affected, fisheries, particularly, in, the, northern, region, the, gulf, sustains, a, large, number, of, marine, mammals, many, of, which, are, rare, and, endangered, its, more, than, 900, islands, are, important, nesting, sites, for, thousands, of, seabirds, and, its, waters, are, primary, breeding, feeding, and, nursing, grounds, for, myriad, migratory, and, resident, fish, species, for, decades, the, gulf, has, been, a, primary, source, of, two, of, mexico, s, leading, marine, resources, sardines, and, anchovies, water, pollution, is, a, problem, in, the, gulf, but, the, more, immediate, concerns, are, overfishing, and, bottom, trawling, which, destroys, eelgrass, beds, and, shellfish, efforts, by, the, mexican, government, to, create, conservation, zones, and, nature, reserves, have, been, hampered, by, lack, of, enforcement, resources, as, well, as, a, lack, of, a, political, consensus, on, this, issue, of, conservation, of, the, gulf, this, occurs, even, though, significant, areas, are, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, thousands, of, miles, of, coastline, are, remote, and, difficult, to, police, and, the, politically, powerful, commercial, fishing, industry, has, been, slow, to, embrace, even, economically, viable, conservation, measures, conservation, of, the, gulf, s, fisheries, and, coastlines, is, also, complicated, by, a, long, history, of, overcapitalization, in, the, sector, and, the, direct, often, negative, impacts, that, conservation, measures, have, on, the, livelihoods, of, mexico, s, coastal, inhabitants, at, present, the, mexican, government, and, business, interests, have, promoted, a, macro, level, tourist, development, vision, for, the, gulf, the, impacts, of, which, on, local, ecology, and, society, are, uncertain, in, 2019, the, gulf, was, added, to, the, list, of, world, heritage, in, danger, because, of, concerns, of, the, imminent, extinction, of, the, vaquita, an, endemic, porpoise, in, the, area, coastal, communities, are, highly, reliant, on, both, commercial, and, sport, fishing, including, san, felipe, san, carlos, cabo, san, lucas, la, paz, loreto, guaymas, bah, a, kino, puerto, pe, asco, topolobampo, and, muleg, the, well, developed, shrimp, and, sardine, fleets, of, mazatl, n, on, the, mexican, mainland, s, pacific, coast, heavily, exploit, the, commercial, fisheries, of, the, southern, gulf, many, marine, organisms, can, survive, only, within, a, particular, salinity, range, which, makes, salinity, a, notable, factor, in, determining, the, types, of, potentially, commercial, organisms, found, in, the, gulf, the, mean, annual, ranges, of, salinity, of, the, sea, of, cortez, are, between, 3, 5, and, 3, 58, at, the, surface, furthermore, the, salinity, of, the, water, of, the, northern, gulf, is, generally, higher, than, the, central, and, southern, faunal, regions, due, to, the, increased, amount, of, evaporation, that, occurs, in, that, region, locals, have, alleged, the, existence, of, a, giant, creature, known, as, the, black, demon, spanish, el, demonio, negro, of, the, sea, of, cortez, it, is, usually, considered, to, be, a, black, shark, and, less, commonly, as, a, whale, measuring, about, 20, to, 60, ft, 6, 1, to, 18, 3, m, and, weighing, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, lb, 23, to, 45, t, similar, to, the, estimated, length, of, the, megalodon, it, is, one, of, a, number, of, alleged, cases, of, giant, sharks, in, the, pacific, ocean, made, throughout, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries
