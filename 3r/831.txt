since, the, sagnc, decision, in, 2005, this, has, led, to, further, controversy, however, as, the, name, of, the, city, had, not, yet, been, changed, and, the, council, was, at, best, acting, prematurely, when, a, complaint, was, lodged, with, the, advertising, standards, authority, asa, it, ruled, that, such, advertisements, are, deliberately, misleading, and, should, be, withdrawn, from, all, media, despite, the, rulings, of, the, asa, tshwane, metro, council, failed, to, discontinue, their, city, of, tshwane, advertisements, as, a, result, the, asa, requested, that, tshwane, metro,

advertisements, in, the, south, african, media, that, refer, to, the, capital, as, tshwane, asa, may, still, place, additional, sanctions, on, the, metro, council, that, would, prevent, it, from,

advertisements, but, placed, them, on, council, owned, advertising, boards, and, busstops, throughout, the, municipal, area, in, august, 2007, an, internal, memo, was, leaked, to, the, media, in, which, the, tshwane, mayor, sought, advice, from, the, premier, of, gauteng, on, whether, the, municipality, could, be, called, the, city, of, tshwane, instead, of, just, tshwane, this, could, increase, confusion, about, the, distinction, between, the, city, of, pretoria, and, the, municipality, of, tshwane, in, early, 2010, it, was, again, rumoured, that, the, south, african, government, would, make, a, decision, regarding, the, name, however, a, media, briefing, regarding, name, changes, which, could, have, been, an, opportunity, to, discuss, it, was, cancelled, shortly, before,

geographic, place, had, been, published, in, the, government, gazette, as, it, had, been, too, late, to, withdraw, the, name, from, the, publication, but, it, was, announced, that, the, name, had, been, withdrawn, pending, further, work, by, officials, the, following, week, the, registration, of, tshwane, was, officially, withdrawn, in, the, government, gazette, the, retraction, had, reportedly, been, ordered, at, the, behest, of, the, deputy, president, of, south, africa, kgalema, motlanthe, acting, on, behalf, of, president, jacob, zuma, as, minister, of, arts, and, culture, lulu, xingwana, had, acted, contrary, to, the, position, of, the, anc, which, is, that, pretoria, and, the, municipality, are, separate, entities, which, was, subsequently, articulated, by, anc, secretary, general, gwede, mantashe, in, march, 2010, a, group, supporting, the, name, change, calling, themselves, the, tshwane, royal, house, committee, claimed, to, be, descendants, of, chief, tshwane, and, demanded, to, be, made, part, of, the, administration, of, the, municipality, according, to, comments, made, by, mayor, kgosientso, ramokgopa, in, late, 2011, the, change, would, occur, in, 2012, however, there, remained, considerable, uncertainty, about, the, issue, as, of, 2024, the, proposed, name, change, has, not, occurred, pretoria, is, twinned, with
