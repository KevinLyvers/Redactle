of, the, azerbaijani, minority, another, major, source, of, dissatisfaction, was, the, support, of, most, of, iranian, azerbaijanis, including, tabriz, residents, from, a, more, liberal, cleric,

especially, the, oil, refinery, was, also, a, major, target, for, airstrikes, by, iraqi, s, air, forces, because, of, the, closeness, to, the, iraqi, borderlines, and, their, strategic, roles, in, the, country, s, economy, with, the, escalation, of, the, war, the, attacks, turned, to, war, of, the, cities, and, the, air, attacks, later, turned, into, the, random, strikes, on, the, residential, areas, of, the, city, in, the, later, phase, of, the, war, in, recent, years, tabriz, is, much, more, stable, and, the, new, developments, in, the, city, are, rapidly, changing, the, face, of, the,
