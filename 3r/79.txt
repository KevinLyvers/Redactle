the, barents, sea, b, r, n, t, s, barr, nts, also, us, b, r, n, t, s, bar, nts, norwegian, barentshavet, urban, east, norwegian, russian, romanized, barentsevo, more, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, located, off, the, northern, coasts, of, norway, and, russia, and, divided, between, norwegian, and, russian, territorial, waters, it, was, known, earlier, among, russians, as, the, northern, sea, pomorsky, sea, or, murman, sea, norse, sea, the, current, name, of, the, sea, is, after, the, historical, dutch, navigator, willem, barentsz, the, barents, sea, is, a, rather, shallow, shelf, sea, with, an, average, depth, of, 230, metres, 750, ft, and, it, is, an, important, site, for, both, fishing, and, hydrocarbon, exploration, it, is, bordered, by, the, kola, peninsula, to, the, south, the, shelf, edge, towards, the, norwegian, sea, to, the, west, the, archipelagos, of, svalbard, to, the, northwest, franz, josef, land, to, the, northeast, and, novaya, zemlya, to, the, east, the, islands, of, novaya, zemlya, an, extension, of, the, northern, end, of, the, ural, mountains, separate, the, barents, sea, from, the, kara, sea, although, part, of, the, arctic, ocean, the, barents, sea, has, been, characterised, as, turning, into, the, atlantic, or, in, the, process, of, being, atlantified, because, of, its, status, as, the, arctic, warming, hot, spot, hydrologic, changes, due, to, global, warming, have, led, to, a, reduction, in, sea, ice, and, in, the, stratification, of, the, water, column, which, could, produce, major, changes, in, weather, in, eurasia, one, prediction, is, that, as, the, barents, sea, s, permanent, ice, free, area, grows, evaporation, will, increase, leading, to, increased, winter, snowfalls, in, much, of, continental, europe, the, southern, half, of, the, barents, sea, including, the, ports, of, murmansk, russia, and, vard, norway, remain, ice, free, year, round, due, to, the, warm, north, atlantic, drift, in, september, the, entire, barents, sea, is, more, or, less, completely, ice, free, in, 1944, finland, s, territory, also, reached, the, barents, sea, the, liinakhamari, harbour, in, the, pechengsky, district, was, finland, s, only, ice, free, winter, harbour, until, it, was, ceded, to, the, soviet, union, there, are, three, main, types, of, water, masses, in, the, barents, sea, warm, salty, atlantic, water, temperature, 3, c, salinity, 35, from, the, north, atlantic, drift, cold, arctic, water, temperature, 0, c, salinity, 35, from, the, north, and, warm, but, not, very, salty, coastal, water, temperature, 3, c, salinity, 34, 7, between, the, atlantic, and, polar, waters, a, front, called, the, polar, front, is, formed, in, the, western, parts, of, the, sea, close, to, bear, island, this, front, is, determined, by, the, bottom, topography, and, is, therefore, relatively, sharp, and, stable, from, year, to, year, while, in, the, east, towards, novaya, zemlya, it, can, be, quite, diffuse, and, its, position, can, vary, markedly, between, years, the, lands, of, novaya, zemlya, attained, most, of, their, early, holocene, coastal, deglaciation, approximately, 10, 000, years, before, the, present, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, barentsz, sea, as, follows, other, islands, in, the, barents, sea, include, chaichy, and, timanets, the, barents, sea, was, originally, formed, from, two, major, continental, collisions, the, caledonian, orogeny, in, which, the, baltica, and, laurentia, collided, to, form, laurasia, and, a, subsequent, collision, between, laurasia, and, western, siberia, most, of, its, geological, history, is, dominated, by, extensional, tectonics, caused, by, the, collapse, of, the, caledonian, and, uralian, orogenic, belts, and, the, break, up, of, pangaea, these, events, created, the, major, rift, basins, that, dominate, the, barents, shelf, along, with, various, platforms, and, structural, highs, the, later, geological, history, of, the, barents, sea, is, dominated, by, late, cenozoic, uplift, particularly, that, caused, by, quaternary, glaciation, which, has, resulted, in, erosion, and, deposition, of, significant, sediment, due, to, the, north, atlantic, drift, the, barents, sea, has, a, high, biological, production, compared, to, other, oceans, of, similar, latitude, the, spring, bloom, of, phytoplankton, can, start, quite, early, near, the, ice, edge, because, the, fresh, water, from, the, melting, ice, makes, up, a, stable, water, layer, on, top, of, the, seawater, the, phytoplankton, bloom, feeds, zooplankton, such, as, calanus, finmarchicus, calanus, glacialis, calanus, hyperboreus, oithona, spp, and, krill, the, zooplankton, feeders, include, young, cod, capelin, polar, cod, whales, and, little, auk, the, capelin, is, a, key, food, for, top, predators, such, as, the, north, east, arctic, cod, harp, seals, and, seabirds, such, as, the, common, guillemot, and, brunnich, s, guillemot, the, fisheries, of, the, barents, sea, in, particular, the, cod, fisheries, are, of, great, importance, for, both, norway, and, russia, sizex, 89, was, an, international, winter, experiment, in, 1989, for, which, the, main, objectives, were, to, perform, sensor, signature, studies, of, different, ice, types, to, develop, sar, algorithms, for, ice, variables, such, as, ice, types, ice, concentrations, and, ice, kinematics, although, previous, research, suggested, that, predation, by, whales, may, be, the, cause, of, depleting, fish, stocks, more, recent, research, suggests, that, marine, mammal, consumption, has, only, a, trivial, influence, on, fisheries, a, model, assessing, the, effects, of, fisheries, and, climate, was, far, more, accurate, at, describing, trends, in, fish, abundance, there, is, a, genetically, distinct, polar, bear, population, associated, with, the, barents, sea, the, barents, sea, is, among, the, most, polluted, places, on, earth, due, to, accumulated, marine, garbage, decades, of, soviet, nuclear, tests, radioactive, waste, dumping, and, industrial, pollution, the, elevated, pollution, has, caused, elevated, rates, of, disease, among, locals, with, rising, military, buildup, and, increased, use, of, shipping, lanes, heading, east, through, the, arctic, there, are, concerns, that, a, further, increase, in, pollution, is, likely, not, least, from, the, increased, risk, of, future, oil, spills, from, ships, not, properly, equipped, for, the, environment, barents, sea, is, the, fastest, warming, part, of, the, arctic, and, some, assessments, now, treat, barents, sea, ice, as, a, separate, tipping, point, from, the, rest, of, the, arctic, sea, ice, suggesting, that, it, could, permanently, disappear, once, the, global, warming, exceeds, 1, 5, degrees, this, rapid, warming, also, makes, it, easier, to, detect, any, potential, connections, between, the, state, of, sea, ice, and, weather, conditions, elsewhere, than, in, any, other, area, the, first, study, proposing, a, connection, between, floating, ice, decline, in, the, barents, sea, and, the, neighbouring, kara, sea, and, more, intense, winters, in, europe, was, published, in, 2010, and, there, has, been, extensive, research, into, this, subject, since, then, for, instance, a, 2019, paper, holds, bks, ice, decline, responsible, for, 44, of, the, 1995, 2014, central, eurasian, cooling, trend, far, more, than, indicated, by, the, models, while, another, study, from, that, year, suggests, that, the, decline, in, bks, ice, reduces, snow, cover, in, the, north, eurasia, but, increases, it, in, central, europe, there, are, also, potential, links, to, summer, precipitation, a, connection, has, been, proposed, between, the, reduced, bks, ice, extent, in, november, december, and, greater, june, rainfall, over, south, china, one, paper, even, identified, a, connection, between, kara, sea, ice, extent, and, the, ice, cover, of, lake, qinghai, on, the, tibetan, plateau, the, barents, sea, was, formerly, known, to, russians, as, murmanskoye, more, or, the, sea, of, murmans, i, e, their, term, for, norwegians, it, appears, with, this, name, in, sixteenth, century, maps, including, gerard, mercator, s, map, of, the, arctic, published, in, his, 1595, atlas, its, eastern, corner, in, the, region, of, the, pechora, river, s, estuary, has, been, known, as, pechorskoye, morye, that, is, pechora, sea, it, was, also, known, as, pomorsky, morye, after, the, first, inhabitants, of, its, shores, the, pomors, this, sea, was, given, its, present, name, by, europeans, in, honour, of, willem, barentsz, a, dutch, navigator, and, explorer, barentsz, was, the, leader, of, early, expeditions, to, the, far, north, at, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, barents, sea, has, been, called, by, sailors, the, devil, s, dance, floor, due, to, its, unpredictability, and, difficulty, level, ocean, rowers, call, it, devil, s, jaw, in, 2017, after, the, first, recorded, complete, man, powered, crossing, of, the, barents, sea, from, troms, to, longyearbyen, in, a, rowboat, by, the, polar, row, expedition, captain, fiann, paul, was, asked, by, norwegian, tv2, how, a, rower, would, name, the, barents, sea, fiann, responded, that, he, would, name, it, devil, s, jaw, adding, that, the, winds, you, constantly, battle, are, like, breath, from, the, devil, s, nostrils, while, he, holds, you, in, his, jaws, seabed, mapping, was, completed, in, 1933, the, first, full, map, was, produced, by, russian, marine, geologist, maria, klenova, the, barents, sea, was, the, site, of, a, notable, world, war, ii, engagement, which, later, became, known, as, the, battle, of, the, barents, sea, under, the, command, of, oskar, kummetz, german, warships, sank, minelayer, hms, bramble, and, destroyer, hms, achates, but, lost, destroyer, z16, friedrich, eckoldt, also, the, german, cruiser, admiral, hipper, was, severely, damaged, by, british, gunfire, the, germans, later, retreated, and, the, british, convoy, arrived, safely, at, murmansk, shortly, afterwards, during, the, cold, war, the, soviet, red, banner, northern, fleet, used, the, southern, reaches, of, the, sea, as, a, ballistic, missile, submarine, bastion, a, strategy, that, russia, continued, nuclear, contamination, from, dumped, russian, naval, reactors, is, an, environmental, concern, in, the, barents, sea, for, decades, there, was, a, boundary, dispute, between, norway, and, russia, regarding, the, position, of, the, boundary, between, their, respective, claims, to, the, barents, sea, the, norwegians, favoured, a, median, line, based, on, the, geneva, convention, of, 1958, whereas, the, russians, favoured, a, meridian, based, sector, line, based, on, a, soviet, decision, of, 1926, a, neutral, grey, zone, between, the, competing, claims, had, an, area, of, 175, 000, square, kilometres, 68, 000, sq, mi, which, is, approximately, 12, of, the, total, area, of, the, barents, sea, the, two, countries, started, negotiations, on, the, location, of, the, boundary, in, 1974, and, agreed, to, a, moratorium, on, hydrocarbon, exploration, in, 1976, twenty, years, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 2010, norway, and, russia, signed, an, agreement, that, placed, the, boundary, equidistant, from, their, competing, claims, this, was, ratified, and, went, into, force, on, 7, july, 2011, opening, the, grey, zone, for, hydrocarbon, exploration, encouraged, by, the, success, of, oil, exploration, and, production, in, the, north, sea, in, the, 1960s, norway, began, hydrocarbon, exploration, in, the, barents, sea, in, 1969, they, acquired, seismic, reflection, surveys, through, the, following, years, which, were, analysed, to, understand, the, location, of, the, main, sedimentary, basins, norskhydro, drilled, the, first, well, in, 1980, which, was, a, dry, hole, and, the, first, discoveries, were, made, the, following, year, the, alke, and, askeladden, gas, fields, several, more, discoveries, were, made, on, the, norwegian, side, of, the, barents, sea, throughout, the, 1980s, including, the, important, sn, hvit, field, however, interest, in, the, area, began, to, wane, due, to, a, succession, of, dry, holes, wells, containing, only, gas, which, was, cheap, at, the, time, and, the, prohibitive, costs, of, developing, wells, in, such, a, remote, area, interest, in, the, area, was, reignited, in, the, late, 2000s, after, the, snovhit, field, was, finally, brought, into, production, and, two, new, large, discoveries, were, made, the, russians, began, exploration, in, their, territory, around, the, same, time, encouraged, by, their, success, in, the, timan, pechora, basin, they, drilled, their, first, wells, in, the, early, 1980s, and, some, very, large, gas, fields, were, discovered, throughout, this, decade, the, shtokman, field, was, discovered, in, 1988, and, is, classed, as, a, giant, gas, field, currently, the, 5th, largest, gas, field, in, the, world, similar, practical, difficulties, barents, sea, resulted, in, a, decline, in, russian, exploration, aggravated, by, the, nation, s, political, instability, of, the, 1990s, the, barents, sea, contains, the, world, s, largest, remaining, cod, population, as, well, as, important, stocks, of, haddock, and, capelin, fishing, is, managed, jointly, by, russia, and, norway, in, the, form, of, the, joint, norwegian, russian, fisheries, commission, established, in, 1976, in, an, attempt, to, keep, track, of, how, many, fish, are, leaving, the, ecosystem, due, to, fishing, the, joint, norwegian, russian, fisheries, commission, sets, total, allowable, catches, tacs, for, multiple, species, throughout, their, migratory, tracks, through, the, commission, norway, and, russia, also, exchange, fishing, quotas, and, catch, statistics, to, ensure, the, tacs, are, not, being, violated, however, there, are, problems, with, reporting, under, this, system, and, researchers, believe, that, they, do, not, have, accurate, data, for, the, effects, of, fishing, on, the, barents, sea, ecosystem, cod, is, one, of, the, major, catches, a, large, portion, of, catches, are, not, reported, when, the, fishing, boats, land, to, account, for, profits, that, are, being, lost, to, high, taxes, and, fees, since, many, fishermen, do, not, strictly, follow, the, tacs, and, rules, set, forth, by, the, commission, the, amount, of, fish, being, extracted, annually, from, the, barents, sea, is, underestimated, the, barents, sea, where, temperate, waters, from, the, gulf, stream, and, cold, waters, from, the, arctic, meet, is, home, to, an, enormous, diversity, of, organisms, which, are, well, adapted, to, the, extreme, conditions, of, their, marine, habitats, this, makes, these, arctic, species, very, attractive, for, marine, bioprospecting, marine, bioprospecting, may, be, defined, as, the, search, for, bioactive, molecules, and, compounds, from, marine, sources, that, have, new, unique, properties, and, the, potential, for, commercial, applications, amongst, others, applications, include, medicines, food, and, feed, textiles, cosmetics, and, the, process, industry, the, norwegian, government, strategically, supports, the, development, of, marine, bioprospecting, as, it, has, the, potential, to, contribute, to, new, and, sustainable, wealth, creation, troms, and, the, northern, areas, of, norway, play, a, central, role, in, this, strategy, they, have, excellent, access, to, unique, arctic, marine, organisms, existing, marine, industries, and, r, d, competence, and, infrastructure, in, this, region, since, 2007, science, and, industry, have, cooperated, closely, on, bioprospecting, and, the, development, and, commercialization, of, new, products
