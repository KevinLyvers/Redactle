the, 14th, century, bc, various, semitic, peoples, appeared, in, the, area, such, as, the, semi, nomadic, suteans, who, came, into, an, unsuccessful, conflict, with, babylonia, to, the, east, and, the, west, semitic, speaking, arameans, who, subsumed, the, earlier, amorites, they, too, were, subjugated, by, assyria, and, the, hittites, for, centuries, the, egyptians, fought, the, hittites, for, control, over, western, syria, the, fighting, reached, its, zenith, in, 1274, bc, with, the, battle, of, kadesh, the, west, remained, part, of, the, hittite, empire, until, its, destruction, c, 1200, bc, while, eastern, syria, largely, became, part, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, who, also, annexed, much, of, the, west, during, the, reign, of, tiglath, pileser, i, 1114, 1076, bc, with, the, destruction, of, the, hittites, and, the, decline, of, assyria, in, the, late, 11th, century, bc, the, aramean, tribes, gained, control, of, much, of, the, interior, founding, states, such, as, bit, bahiani, aram, damascus, hamath, aram, rehob, aram, naharaim, and, luhuti, from, this, point, the, region, became, known, as, aramea, or, aram, there, was, also, a, synthesis, between, the, semitic, arameans, and, the, remnants, of, the, indo, european, hittites, with, the, founding, of, a, number, of, syro, hittite, states, centered, in, north, central, aram, syria, and, south, central, asia, minor, modern, turkey, including, palistin, carchemish, and, sam, al, a, canaanite, group, known, as, the, phoenicians, came, to, dominate, the, coasts, of, syria, and, also, lebanon, and, northern, palestine, from, the, 13th, century, bc, founding, city, states, such, as, amrit, simyra, arwad, paltos, ramitha, and, shuksi, from, these, coastal, regions, they, eventually, spread, their, influence, throughout, the, mediterranean, including, building, colonies, in, malta, sicily, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, spain, and, portugal, and, the, coasts, of, north, africa, and, most, significantly, founding, the, major, city, state, of, carthage, in, modern, tunisia, in, the, 9th, century, bc, which, was, much, later, to, become, the, center, of, a, major, empire, rivaling, the, roman, republic, syria, and, the, western, half, of, near, east, then, fell, to, the, vast, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, bc, 605, bc, the, assyrians, introduced, imperial, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, their, empire, this, language, was, to, remain, dominant, in, syria, and, the, entire, near, east, until, after, the, arab, islamic, conquest, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ad, and, was, to, be, a, vehicle, for, the, spread, of, christianity, the, assyrians, named, their, colonies, of, syria, and, lebanon, eber, nari, assyrian, domination, ended, after, the, assyrians, greatly, weakened, themselves, in, a, series, of, brutal, internal, civil, wars, followed, by, attacks, from, the, medes, babylonians, chaldeans, persians, scythians, and, cimmerians, during, the, fall, of, assyria, the, scythians, ravaged, and, plundered, much, of, syria, the, last, stand, of, the, assyrian, army, was, at, carchemish, in, northern, syria, in, 605, bc, the, assyrian, empire, was, followed, by, the, neo, babylonian, empire, 605, bc, 539, bc, during, this, period, syria, became, a, battle, ground, between, babylonia, and, another, former, assyrian, colony, that, of, egypt, the, babylonians, like, their, assyrian, relations, were, victorious, over, egypt, lands, that, constitute, modern, day, syria, were, part, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, and, had, been, annexed, by, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 539, bc, led, by, cyrus, the, great, the, achaemenid, persians, retained, imperial, aramaic, as, one, of, the, diplomatic, languages, of, their, empire, 539, bc, 330, bc, as, well, as, the, assyrian, name, for, the, new, satrapy, of, aram, syria, eber, nari, syria, was, later, conquered, by, the, macedonian, empire, which, was, ruled, by, alexander, the, great, c, 330, bc, and, consequently, became, coele, syria, province, of, the, seleucid, empire, 323, bc, 64, bc, with, the, seleucid, kings, styling, themselves, king, of, syria, and, the, city, of, antioch, being, its, capital, starting, from, 240, thus, it, was, the, greeks, who, introduced, the, name, syria, to, the, region, originally, an, indo, european, corruption, of, assyria, in, northern, mesopotamia, iraq, the, greeks, used, this, term, to, describe, not, only, assyria, itself, but, also, the, lands, to, the, west, which, had, for, centuries, been, under, assyrian, dominion, thus, in, the, greco, roman, world, both, the, arameans, of, syria, and, the, assyrians, of, mesopotamia, modern, day, iraq, to, the, east, were, referred, to, as, syrians, or, syriacs, despite, these, being, distinct, peoples, in, their, own, right, a, confusion, which, would, continue, into, the, modern, world, eventually, parts, of, southern, seleucid, syria, were, taken, by, the, jewish, hasmoneans, dynasty, upon, the, slow, disintegration, of, the, hellenistic, empire, syria, briefly, came, under, armenian, control, from, 83, bc, with, the, conquests, of, the, armenian, king, tigranes, the, great, who, was, welcomed, as, a, savior, from, the, seleucids, and, romans, by, the, syrian, people, however, pompey, the, great, a, general, of, the, roman, empire, rode, to, syria, and, captured, antioch, its, capital, and, turned, syria, into, a, roman, province, in, 64, bc, thus, ending, armenian, control, over, the, region, which, had, lasted, two, decades, syria, prospered, under, roman, rule, being, strategically, located, on, the, silk, road, which, gave, it, massive, wealth, and, importance, making, it, the, battleground, for, the, rivaling, romans, and, persians, palmyra, a, rich, and, sometimes, powerful, native, aramaic, speaking, kingdom, arose, in, northern, syria, in, the, 2nd, century, the, palmyrene, established, a, trade, network, that, made, the, city, one, of, the, richest, in, the, roman, empire, eventually, in, the, late, 3rd, century, ad, the, palmyrene, king, odaenathus, defeated, the, persian, emperor, shapur, i, and, controlled, the, entirety, of, the, roman, east, while, his, successor, and, widow, zenobia, established, the, palmyrene, empire, which, briefly, conquered, egypt, syria, palestine, much, of, asia, minor, judah, and, lebanon, before, being, finally, brought, under, roman, control, in, 273, ad, the, northern, mesopotamian, assyrian, kingdom, of, adiabene, controlled, areas, of, north, east, syria, between, 10, ad, and, 117, ad,

at, the, site, of, fort, arbeia, control, of, syria, eventually, passed, from, the, romans, to, the, byzantines, with, the, split, in, the, roman, empire, the, largely, aramaic, speaking, population, of, syria, during, the, heyday, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, probably, not, exceeded, again, until, the, 19th, century, prior, to, the, arab, islamic, conquest, in, the, 7th, century, ad, the, bulk, of, the, population, were, arameans, but, syria, was, also, home, to, greek, and, roman, ruling, classes, assyrians, still, dwelt, in, the, north, east, phoenicians, along, the, coasts, and, jewish, and, armenian, communities, were, also, extant, in, major, cities, with, nabateans, and, pre, islamic, arabs, such, as, the, lakhmids, and, ghassanids, dwelling, in, the, deserts, of,

focused, on, his, home, town, of, philippopolis, modern, day, shahba, and, began, many, construction, projects, to, improve, the, city, most, of, which, were, halted, after, his, death, syria, is, significant, in, the, history, of, christianity, saulus, of, tarsus, better, known, as, the, apostle, paul, was, converted, on, the, road, to, damascus, and, emerged, as, a, significant, figure, in, the, christian, church, at, antioch, in, ancient, syria, from, which, he, left, on, many, of, his, missionary, journeys, muhammad, s, first, interaction, with, the, people, and, tribes, of, syria, was, during, the, invasion, of, dumatul, jandal, in, july, 626, where, he, ordered, his, followers, to, invade, duma, because, muhammad, received, intelligence, that, some, tribes, there, were, involved, in, highway, robbery, and, preparing, to, attack, medina, itself, william, montgomery, watt, claims, that, this, was, the, most, significant, expedition, muhammad, ordered, at, the, time, even, though, it, received, little, notice, in, the, primary, sources, dumat, al, jandal, was, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, from, medina, and, watt, says, that, there, was, no, immediate, threat, to, muhammad, other, than, the, possibility, that, his, communications, to, syria, and, supplies, to, medina, would, be, interrupted, watt, says, it, is, tempting, to, suppose, that, muhammad, was, already, envisaging, something, of, the, expansion, which, took, place, after, his, death, and, that, the, rapid, march, of, his, troops, must, have, impressed, all, those, who, heard, of, it, william, muir, also, believes, that, the, expedition, was, important, as, muhammad, followed, by, 1000, men, reached, the, confines, of, syria, where, distant, tribes, had, now, learnt, his, name, while, the, political, horizon, of, muhammad, was, extended, by, ad, 640, syria, was, conquered, by, the, arab, rashidun, army, led, by, khalid, ibn, al, walid, in, the, mid, 7th, century, the, umayyad, dynasty, then, rulers, of, the, empire, placed, the, capital, of, the, empire, in, damascus, the, country, s, power, declined, during, later, umayyad, rule, this, was, mainly, due, to, totalitarianism, corruption, and, the, resulting, revolutions, the, umayyad, dynasty, was, then, overthrown, in, 750, by, the, abbasid, dynasty, which, moved, the, capital, of, empire, to, baghdad,
