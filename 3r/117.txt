lake, baikal, b, a, k, l, k, l, by, kahl, kal, russian, romanized, ozero, baykal, buryat, romanized, baigal, dalai, is, the, deepest, rift, lake, in, the, world, it, is, situated, in, southern, siberia, russia, between, the, federal, subjects, of, irkutsk, oblast, to, the, northwest, and, the, republic, of, buryatia, to, the, southeast, at, 31, 722, km, 2, 12, 248, sq, mi, slightly, larger, than, belgium, lake, baikal, is, the, world, s, seventh, largest, lake, by, surface, area, as, well, as, the, second, largest, lake, in, eurasia, after, the, caspian, sea, however, because, it, is, also, the, deepest, lake, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 1, 642, metres, 5, 387, feet, 898, fathoms, lake, baikal, is, the, world, s, largest, freshwater, lake, by, volume, containing, 23, 615, 39, km, 3, 5, 670, cu, mi, of, water, or, 22, 23, of, the, world, s, fresh, surface, water, more, than, all, of, the, north, american, great, lakes, combined, it, is, also, the, world, s, oldest, lake, at, 25, 30, million, years, and, among, the, clearest, lake, baikal, is, home, to, thousands, of, species, of, plants, and, animals, many, of, them, endemic, to, the, region, it, is, also, home, to, buryat, tribes, who, raise, goats, camels, cattle, sheep, and, horses, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, lake, where, the, mean, temperature, varies, from, a, winter, minimum, of, 19, c, 2, f, to, a, summer, maximum, of, 14, c, 57, f, the, region, to, the, east, of, lake, baikal, is, referred, to, as, transbaikalia, or, as, the, transbaikal, and, the, loosely, defined, region, around, the, lake, itself, is, sometimes, known, as, baikalia, unesco, declared, baikal, a, world, heritage, site, in, 1996, lake, baikal, is, in, a, rift, valley, created, by, the, baikal, rift, zone, where, the, earth, s, crust, is, slowly, pulling, apart, at, 636, km, 395, mi, long, and, 79, km, 49, mi, wide, lake, baikal, has, the, largest, surface, area, of, any, freshwater, lake, in, asia, at, 31, 722, km, 2, 12, 248, sq, mi, and, is, the, deepest, lake, in, the, world, at, 1, 642, metres, 5, 387, feet, 898, fathoms, the, surface, of, the, lake, is, 455, 5, m, 1, 494, ft, above, sea, level, while, the, bottom, of, the, lake, is, 1, 186, 5, m, 3, 893, ft, 648, 8, fathoms, below, sea, level, and, below, this, lies, some, 7, km, 4, 3, mi, of, sediment, placing, the, rift, floor, some, 8, 11, km, 5, 0, 6, 8, mi, below, the, surface, the, deepest, continental, rift, on, earth, in, geological, terms, the, rift, is, young, and, active, it, widens, about, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, per, year, the, fault, zone, is, also, seismically, active, hot, springs, occur, in, the, area, and, notable, earthquakes, happen, every, few, years, the, lake, is, divided, into, three, basins, north, central, and, south, with, depths, about, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, 1, 600, m, 5, 200, ft, and, 1, 400, m, 4, 600, ft, respectively, fault, controlled, accommodation, zones, rising, to, depths, about, 300, m, 980, ft, separate, the, basins, the, north, and, central, basins, are, separated, by, academician, ridge, while, the, area, around, the, selenga, delta, and, the, buguldeika, saddle, separates, the, central, and, south, basins, the, lake, drains, into, the, angara, a, tributary, of, the, yenisey, landforms, include, cape, ryty, on, baikal, s, northwest, coast, baikal, s, age, is, estimated, at, 25, 30, million, years, making, it, the, most, ancient, lake, in, geological, history, it, is, unique, among, large, high, latitude, lakes, as, its, sediments, have, not, been, scoured, by, overriding, continental, ice, sheets, russian, u, s, and, japanese, cooperative, studies, of, deep, drilling, core, sediments, in, the, 1990s, provide, a, detailed, record, of, climatic, variation, over, the, past, 6, 7, million, years, longer, and, deeper, sediment, cores, are, expected, in, the, near, future, lake, baikal, is, the, only, confined, freshwater, lake, in, which, direct, and, indirect, evidence, of, gas, hydrates, exists, the, lake, is, surrounded, by, mountains, the, baikal, mountains, on, the, north, shore, the, barguzin, range, on, the, northeastern, shore, and, the, primorsky, range, stretching, along, the, western, shore, the, mountains, and, the, taiga, are, protected, as, a, national, park, it, contains, 27, islands, the, largest, olkhon, is, 72, km, 45, mi, long, and, is, the, third, largest, lake, bound, island, in, the, world, the, lake, is, fed, by, as, many, as, 330, inflowing, rivers, the, main, ones, draining, directly, into, baikal, are, the, selenga, the, barguzin, the, upper, angara, the, turka, the, sarma, and, the, snezhnaya, it, is, drained, through, a, single, outlet, the, angara, regular, winds, exist, in, baikal, s, rift, valley, baikal, is, one, of, the, clearest, lakes, in, the, world, during, the, winter, the, water, transparency, in, open, sections, can, be, as, much, as, 30, 40, m, 100, 130, ft, but, during, the, summer, it, is, typically, 5, 8, m, 15, 25, ft, baikal, is, rich, in, oxygen, even, in, deep, sections, which, separates, it, from, distinctly, stratified, bodies, of, water, such, as, lake, tanganyika, and, the, black, sea, in, lake, baikal, the, water, temperature, varies, significantly, depending, on, location, depth, and, time, of, the, year, during, the, winter, and, spring, the, surface, freezes, for, about, 4, 5, months, from, early, january, to, early, may, june, latest, in, the, north, the, lake, surface, is, covered, in, ice, on, average, the, ice, reaches, a, thickness, of, 0, 5, to, 1, 4, m, 1, 6, 4, 6, ft, but, in, some, places, with, hummocks, it, can, be, more, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, during, this, period, the, temperature, slowly, increases, with, depth, in, the, lake, being, coldest, near, the, ice, covered, surface, at, around, freezing, and, reaching, about, 3, 5, 3, 8, c, 38, 3, 38, 8, f, at, a, depth, of, 200, 250, m, 660, 820, ft, after, the, surface, ice, breaks, up, the, surface, water, is, slowly, warmed, up, by, the, sun, and, in, may, june, the, upper, 300, m, 980, ft, or, so, becomes, homothermic, same, temperature, throughout, at, around, 4, c, 39, f, because, of, water, mixing, the, sun, continues, to, heat, up, the, surface, layer, and, at, the, peak, in, august, can, reach, up, to, about, 16, c, 61, f, in, the, main, sections, and, 20, 24, c, 68, 75, f, in, shallow, bays, in, the, southern, half, of, the, lake, during, this, time, the, pattern, is, inverted, compared, to, the, winter, and, spring, as, the, water, temperature, falls, with, increasing, depth, as, the, autumn, begins, the, surface, temperature, falls, again, and, a, second, homothermic, period, at, around, 4, c, 39, f, of, the, upper, circa, 300, m, 980, ft, occurs, in, october, november, in, the, deepest, parts, of, the, lake, from, about, 300, m, 980, ft, the, temperature, is, stable, at, 3, 1, 3, 4, c, 37, 6, 38, 1, f, with, only, minor, annual, variations, the, average, surface, temperature, has, risen, by, almost, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, in, the, last, 50, years, resulting, in, a, shorter, period, where, the, lake, is, covered, by, ice, at, some, locations, hydrothermal, vents, with, water, that, is, about, 50, c, 122, f, have, been, found, these, are, mostly, in, deep, water, but, locally, have, also, been, found, in, relatively, shallow, water, they, have, little, effect, on, the, lake, s, temperature, because, of, its, huge, volume, stormy, weather, on, the, lake, is, common, especially, during, the, summer, and, autumn, and, can, result, in, waves, as, high, as, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, lake, baikal, is, rich, in, biodiversity, it, hosts, more, than, 1, 000, species, of, plants, and, 2, 500, species, of, animals, based, on, current, knowledge, but, the, actual, figures, for, both, groups, are, believed, to, be, significantly, higher, more, than, 80, of, the, animals, are, endemic, the, watershed, of, lake, baikal, has, numerous, floral, species, represented, the, marsh, thistle, cirsium, palustre, is, found, here, at, the, eastern, limit, of, its, geographic, range, submerged, macrophytic, vascular, plants, are, mostly, absent, except, in, some, shallow, bays, along, the, shores, of, lake, baikal, more, than, 85, species, of, submerged, macrophytes, have, been, recorded, including, genera, such, as, ceratophyllum, myriophyllum, potamogeton, and, sparganium, the, invasive, species, elodea, canadensis, was, introduced, to, the, lake, in, the, 1950s, instead, of, vascular, plants, aquatic, flora, is, often, dominated, by, several, green, algae, species, notably, draparnaldioides, tetraspora, and, ulothrix, in, water, shallower, than, 20, m, 65, ft, although, aegagrophila, cladophora, and, draparnaldioides, may, occur, deeper, than, 30, m, 100, ft, except, for, ulothrix, there, are, endemic, baikal, species, in, all, these, green, algae, genera, more, than, 400, diatom, species, both, benthic, and, planktonic, are, found, in, the, lake, and, about, half, of, these, are, endemic, to, baikal, however, significant, taxonomic, uncertainties, remain, for, this, group, the, baikal, seal, or, nerpa, pusa, sibirica, is, endemic, to, lake, baikal, a, wide, range, of, land, mammals, can, be, found, in, the, habitats, around, the, lake, such, as, the, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, eurasian, wolf, canis, lupus, lupus, red, fox, vulpes, vulpes, sable, martes, zibellina, stoat, mustela, erminea, eurasian, otter, lutra, lutra, snow, leopard, panthera, uncia, moose, alces, alces, elk, cervus, canadensis, reindeer, rangifer, tarandus,

marmota, sp, lemmings, lemmus, sp, and, mountain, hare, lepus, timidus, until, the, early, middle, ages, populations, of, the, european, bison, bison, bonasus, were, found, near, the, lake, this, represented, the, easternmost, range, of, the, species, there, are, 236, species, of, birds, that, inhabit, lake, baikal, 29, of, which, are, waterfowl, although, named, after, the, lake, both, the, baikal, teal, and, baikal, bush, warbler, are, widespread, in, eastern, asia, fewer, than, 65, native, fish, species, occur, in, the, lake, basin, but, more, than, half, of, these, are, endemic, the, families, abyssocottidae, deep, water, sculpins, comephoridae, golomyankas, or, baikal, oilfish, and, cottocomephoridae, baikal, sculpins, are, entirely, restricted, to, the, lake, basin, all, these, are, part, of, the, cottoidea, and, are, typically, less, than, 20, cm, 8, in, long, of, particular, note, are, the, two, species, of, golomyanka, comephorus, baicalensis, and, c, dybowskii, these, long, finned, translucent, fish, typically, live, in, open, water, at, depths, of, 100, 500, m, 330, 1, 640, ft, but, occur, both, shallower, and, much, deeper, together, with, certain, abyssocottid, sculpins, they, are, the, deepest, living, freshwater, fish, in, the, world, occurring, near, the, bottom, of, lake, baikal, the, golomyankas, are, the, primary, prey, of, the, baikal, seal, and, represent, the, largest, fish, biomass, in, the, lake, beyond, members, of, cottoidea, there, are, few, endemic, fish, species, in, the, lake, basin, the, most, important, local, species, for, fisheries, is, the, omul, coregonus, migratorius, an, endemic, whitefish, it, is, caught, smoked, and, then, sold, widely, in, markets, around, the, lake, also, a, second, endemic, whitefish, inhabits, the, lake, c, baicalensis, the, baikal, black, grayling, thymallus, baicalensis, baikal, white, grayling, t, brevipinnis, and, baikal, sturgeon, acipenser, baerii, baicalensis, are, other, important, species, with, commercial, value, they, are, also, endemic, to, the, lake, baikal, basin, the, lake, hosts, a, rich, endemic, fauna, of, invertebrates, the, copepod, epischura, baikalensis, is, endemic, to, lake, baikal, and, the, dominating, zooplankton, species, there, making, up, 80, to, 90, of, the, total, biomass, it, is, estimated, that, they, filter, as, much, as, a, thousand, cubic, kilometers, of, water, a, year, or, the, lake, s, entire, volume, every, twenty, three, years, among, the, most, diverse, invertebrate, groups, are, the, amphipod, and, ostracod, crustaceans, freshwater, snails, annelid, worms, and, turbellarian, worms, more, than, 350, species, and, subspecies, of, amphipods, are, endemic, to, the, lake, they, are, exceptionally, diverse, in, ecology, and, appearance, ranging, from, the, pelagic, macrohectopus, to, the, relatively, large, deep, water, abyssogammarus, and, garjajewia, the, tiny, herbivorous, micruropus, and, the, parasitic, pachyschesis, parasitic, on, other, amphipods, the, gigantism, of, some, baikal, amphipods, which, has, been, compared, to, that, seen, in, antarctic, amphipods, has, been, linked, to, the, high, level, of, dissolved, oxygen, in, the, lake, among, the, giants, are, several, species, of, spiny, acanthogammarus, and, brachyuropus, acanthogammaridae, found, at, both, shallow, and, deep, depths, these, conspicuous, and, common, amphipods, are, essentially, carnivores, will, also, take, detritus, and, can, reach, a, body, length, up, to, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, the, number, of, isopods, is, low, they, belong, to, the, family, asellidae, there, are, four, species, of, the, genus, baicalasellus, and, the, two, species, mesoasellus, dybowskii, and, limnoasellus, poberezhnii, these, six, endemic, species, are, found, on, rocky, substrata, in, depths, varying, from, 3, 10, meters, baicalasellus, angarensis, to, more, than, hundred, meters, mesoasellus, dybowskii, there, are, about, 60, known, species, of, cladocerans, water, fleas, several, of, them, endemic, similar, to, another, ancient, lake, tanganyika, baikal, is, a, center, for, ostracod, diversity, about, 90, of, the, lake, baikal, ostracods, are, endemic, meaning, that, there, are, c, 200, endemic, species, this, makes, it, the, second, most, diverse, group, of, crustacean, in, the, lake, after, the, amphipods, the, vast, majority, of, the, baikal, ostracods, belong, to, the, families, candonidae, more, than, 100, described, species, and, cytherideidae, about, 50, described, species, but, genetic, studies, indicate, that, the, true, diversity, in, at, least, the, latter, family, has, been, heavily, underestimated, the, morphology, of, the, baikal, ostracods, is, highly, diverse, as, of, 2006, almost, 150, freshwater, snails, are, known, from, lake, baikal, including, 117, endemic, species, from, the, subfamilies, baicaliinae, part, of, the, amnicolidae, and, benedictiinae, part, of, the, lithoglyphidae, and, the, families, planorbidae, and, valvatidae, all, endemics, have, been, recorded, between, 20, and, 30, m, 66, and, 98, ft, but, the, majority, mainly, live, at, shallower, depths, about, 30, freshwater, snail, species, can, be, seen, deeper, than, 100, m, 330, ft, which, represents, the, approximate, limit, of, the, sunlight, zone, but, only, 10, are, truly, deepwater, species, in, general, baikal, snails, are, thin, shelled, and, small, two, of, the, most, common, species, are, benedictia, baicalensis, and, megalovalvata, baicalensis, bivalve, diversity, is, lower, with, more, than, 30, species, about, half, of, these, all, in, the, families, euglesidae, pisidiidae, and, sphaeriidae, are, endemic, the, only, other, family, in, the, lake, is, the, unionidae, with, a, single, nonendemic, species, the, endemic, bivalves, are, mainly, found, in, shallows, with, few, species, from, deep, water, with, almost, 200, described, species, including, more, than, 160, endemics, the, center, of, diversity, for, aquatic, freshwater, oligochaetes, is, lake, baikal, a, smaller, number, of, other, freshwater, annelids, is, known, 30, species, of, leeches, hirudinea, and, 4, polychaetes, several, hundred, species, of, nematodes, are, known, from, the, lake, but, a, large, percentage, of, these, are, undescribed, more, than, 140, endemic, flatworm, plathelminthes, species, are, in, lake, baikal, where, they, occur, on, a, wide, range, of, bottom, types, most, of, the, flatworms, are, predatory, and, some, are, relatively, brightly, marked, they, are, often, abundant, in, shallow, waters, where, they, are, typically, less, than, 2, cm, 1, in, long, but, in, deeper, parts, of, the, lake, the, largest, baikaloplana, valida, can, reach, up, to, 30, cm, 1, ft, when, outstretched, at, least, 18, species, of, sponges, occur, in, the, lake, including, about, 15, species, from, the, endemic, family, lubomirskiidae, the, remaining, are, from, the, nonendemic, family, spongillidae, which, colonized, the, lake, about, 3, 4, million, years, ago, the, lake, s, sponges, makes, up, around, 44, of, the, benthic, animal, biomass, lubomirskia, baicalensis, baikalospongia, bacillifera, and, b, intermedia, are, unusually, large, for, freshwater, sponges, and, can, reach, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, or, more, these, three, are, also, the, most, common, sponges, in, the, lake, while, the, baikalospongia, species, typically, have, encrusting, or, carpet, like, structures, l, baikalensis, often, has, branching, structures, and, in, areas, where, common, may, form, underwater, forests, most, sponges, in, the, lake, are, typically, green, when, alive, because, of, symbiotic, chlorophytes, zoochlorella, but, can, also, be, brownish, or, yellowish, the, baikal, area, sometimes, known, as, baikalia, has, a, long, history, of, human, habitation, near, the, village, of, mal, ta, some, 160, km, northwest, of, the, lake, remains, of, a, young, human, male, known, as, ma, 1, or, mal, ta, boy, are, indications, of, local, habitation, by, the, mal, ta, buret, culture, ca, 24, 000, bp, an, early, known, tribe, in, the, area, was, the, kurykans, located, in, the, former, northern, territory, of, the, xiongnu, confederation, lake, baikal, is, one, site, of, the, han, xiongnu, war, where, the, armies, of, the, han, dynasty, pursued, and, defeated, the, xiongnu, forces, from, the, second, century, bc, to, the, first, century, ad, they, recorded, that, the, lake, was, a, huge, sea, hanhai, and, designated, it, the, north, sea, b, ih, i, of, the, semimythical, four, seas, the, kurykans, a, siberian, tribe, who, inhabited, the, area, in, the, sixth, century, gave, it, a, name, that, translates, to, much, water, later, on, it, was, called, natural, lake, baygal, nuur, by, the, buryats, and, rich, lake, bay, g, l, by, the, yakuts, little, was, known, to, europeans, about, the, lake, until, russia, expanded, into, the, area, in, the, 1600s, the, first, russian, explorer, to, reach, lake, baikal, was, kurbat, ivanov, in, 1643, lake, baikal, was, under, the, anbei, protectorate, of, the, tang, dynasty, from, 647, ce, to, 682, ce, russian, expansion, into, the, buryat, area, around, lake, baikal, in, 1628, 58, was, part, of, the, russian, conquest, of, siberia, it, was, done, first, by, following, the, angara, river, upstream, from, yeniseysk, founded, 1619, and, later, by, moving, south, from, the, lena, river, russians, first, heard, of, the, buryats, in, 1609, at, tomsk, according, to, folktales, related, a, century, after, the, fact, in, 1623, demid, pyanda, who, may, have, been, the, first, russian, to, reach, the, lena, crossed, from, the, upper, lena, to, the, angara, and, arrived, at, yeniseysk, vikhor, savin, 1624, and, maksim, perfilyev, 1626, and, 1627, 28, explored, tungus, country, on, the, lower, angara, to, the, west, krasnoyarsk, on, the, upper, yenisei, was, founded, in, 1627, a, number, of, ill, documented, expeditions, explored, eastward, from, krasnoyarsk, in, 1628, pyotr, beketov, first, encountered, a, group, of, buryats, and, collected, yasak, tribute, from, them, at, the, future, site, of, bratsk, in, 1629, yakov, khripunov, set, off, from, tomsk, to, find, a, rumored, silver, mine, his, men, soon, began, plundering, both, russians, and, natives, they, were, joined, by, another, band, of, rioters, from, krasnoyarsk, but, left, the, buryat, country, when, they, ran, short, of, food, this, made, it, difficult, for, other, russians, to, enter, the, area, in, 1631, maksim, perfilyev, built, an, ostrog, at, bratsk, the, pacification, was, moderately, successful, but, in, 1634, bratsk, was, destroyed, and, its, garrison, killed, in, 1635, bratsk, was, restored, by, a, punitive, expedition, under, radukovskii, in, 1638, it, was, besieged, unsuccessfully, in, 1638, perfilyev, crossed, from, the, angara, over, the, ilim, portage, to, the, lena, river, and, went, downstream, as, far, as, olyokminsk, returning, he, sailed, up, the, vitim, river, into, the, area, east, of, lake, baikal, 1640, where, he, heard, reports, of, the, amur, country, in, 1641, verkholensk, was, founded, on, the, upper, lena, in, 1643, kurbat, ivanov, went, further, up, the, lena, and, became, the, first, russian, to, see, lake, baikal, and, olkhon, island, half, his, party, under, skorokhodov, remained, on, the, lake, reached, the, upper, angara, at, its, northern, tip, and, wintered, on, the, barguzin, river, on, the, northeast, side, in, 1644, ivan, pokhabov, went, up, the, angara, to, baikal, becoming, perhaps, the, first, russian, to, use, this, route, which, is, difficult, because, of, the, rapids, he, crossed, the, lake, and, explored, the, lower, selenge, river, about, 1647, he, repeated, the, trip, obtained, guides, and, visited, a, tsetsen, khan, near, ulan, bator, in, 1648, ivan, galkin, built, an, ostrog, on, the, barguzin, river, which, became, a, center, for, eastward, expansion, in, 1652, vasily, kolesnikov, reported, from, barguzin, that, one, could, reach, the, amur, country, by, following, the, selenga, uda, and, khilok, rivers, to, the, future, sites, of, chita, and, nerchinsk, the, trans, siberian, railway, was, built, between, 1896, and, 1902, construction, of, the, scenic, railway, around, the, southwestern, end, of, lake, baikal, required, 200, bridges, and, 33, tunnels, until, its, completion, a, train, ferry, transported, railcars, across, the, lake, from, port, baikal, to, mysovaya, for, a, number, of, years,

historically, low, water, levels, this, spurred, protests, by, the, local, population, that, the, lake, would, be, drained, of, its, water, at, which, point, the, local, government, halted, the, plans, pending, analysis, according, to, the, moscow, times, and, vice, an, increasing, number, of, an, invasive, species, of, algae, thrive, in, the, lake, from, hundreds, of, tons, of, liquid,
