yet, architecturally, the, city, had, never, been, traditionally, southern, atlanta, originated, as, a, railroad, town, rather, than, a, southern, seaport, dominated, by, the, planter, class, such, as, savannah, or, charleston, because, of, its, later, development, many, of, the, city, s, landmarks, share, architectural, characteristics, with, buildings, in, the, northeast, or, midwest, as, they, were, designed, at, a, time, of, shared, national, architectural, styles, during, the, late, 20th, century, atlanta, embraced, the, global, trend, of, modern, architecture, especially, for,
