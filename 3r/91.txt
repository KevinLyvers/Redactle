lake, victoria, is, one, of, the, african, great, lakes, with, a, surface, area, of, approximately, 59, 947, km, 2, 23, 146, sq, mi, lake, victoria, is, africa, s, largest, lake, by, area, the, world, s, largest, tropical, lake, and, the, world, s, second, largest, fresh, water, lake, by, surface, area, after, lake, superior, in, north, america, in, terms, of, volume, lake, victoria, is, the, world, s, ninth, largest, continental, lake, containing, about, 2, 424, km, 3, 1, 965, 10, 9, acre, ft, of, water, lake, victoria, occupies, a, shallow, depression, in, africa, the, lake, has, an, average, depth, of, 40, m, 130, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 80, 81, m, 262, 266, ft, its, catchment, area, covers, 169, 858, km, 2, 65, 583, sq, mi, the, lake, has, a, shoreline, of, 7, 142, km, 4, 438, mi, when, digitized, at, the, 1, 25, 000, level, with, islands, constituting, 3, 7, of, this, length, the, lake, s, area, is, divided, among, three, countries, tanzania, occupies, 49, 33, 700, km, 2, 13, 000, sq, mi, uganda, 45, 31, 000, km, 2, 12, 000, sq, mi, and, kenya, 6, 4, 100, km, 2, 1, 600, sq, mi, the, lake, is, home, to, many, species, of, fish, which, live, nowhere, else, especially, cichlids, invasive, fish, such, as, the, nile, perch, have, driven, many, endemic, species, to, extinction, though, having, multiple, local, language, names, swahili, ukerewe, dholuo, nam, lolwe, luganda, nnalubaale, kinyarwanda, nyanza, the, lake, was, renamed, after, queen, victoria, by, the, explorer, john, hanning, speke, the, first, briton, to, document, it, in, 1858, while, on, an, expedition, with, richard, francis, burton, geologically, lake, victoria, is, relatively, young, at, about, 400, 000, years, old, it, was, formed, when, westward, flowing, rivers, were, dammed, by, an, upthrown, crustal, block, during, the, miocene, era, what, is, now, the, catchment, area, of, the, lake, was, on, the, western, side, of, an, uplifted, area, that, functioned, as, a, continental, divide, with, streams, on, the, western, side, flowing, into, the, congo, river, basin, and, streams, on, the, eastern, side, flowing, to, the, indian, ocean, as, the, east, african, rift, system, formed, the, eastern, wall, of, the, albertine, rift, or, western, rift, rose, gradually, reversing, the, drainage, towards, what, is, now, lake, victoria, the, opening, of, the, main, east, african, rift, and, the, albertine, rift, downwarped, the, area, between, them, as, the, rift, walls, rose, creating, the, current, lake, victoria, basin, during, its, geological, history, lake, victoria, went, through, changes, ranging, from, its, present, shallow, depression, through, to, what, may, have, been, a, series, of, much, smaller, lakes, geological, cores, taken, from, its, bottom, show, lake, victoria, has, dried, up, completely, at, least, three, times, since, it, formed, these, drying, cycles, are, probably, related, to, past, ice, ages, which, were, times, when, precipitation, declined, globally, lake, victoria, last, dried, out, about, 17, 300, years, ago, and, it, refilled, 14, 700, years, ago, as, the, african, humid, period, began, lake, victoria, receives, 80, percent, of, its, water, from, direct, rainfall, average, evaporation, on, the, lake, is, between, 2, 0, and, 2, 2, metres, 6, 6, and, 7, 2, ft, per, year, almost, double, the, precipitation, of, riparian, areas, lake, victoria, receives, its, water, additionally, from, rivers, and, thousands, of, small, streams, the, kagera, river, is, the, largest, river, flowing, into, this, lake, with, its, mouth, on, the, lake, s, western, shore, lake, victoria, is, drained, solely, by, the, nile, river, near, jinja, uganda, on, the, lake, s, northern, shore, in, the, kenya, sector, the, main, influent, rivers, are, the, sio, nzoia, yala, nyando, sondu, miriu, mogusi, and, migori, the, only, outflow, from, lake, victoria, is, the, nile, river, which, exits, the, lake, near, jinja, uganda, in, terms, of, contributed, water, this, makes, lake, victoria, the, principal, source, of, the, longest, branch, of, the, nile, however, the, most, distal, source, of, the, nile, basin, and, therefore, the, ultimate, source, of, the, nile, is, more, often, considered, to, be, one, of, the, tributary, rivers, of, the, kagera, river, the, exact, tributary, remains, undetermined, and, which, originates, in, either, rwanda, or, burundi, the, uppermost, section, of, the, nile, is, generally, known, as, the, victoria, nile, until, it, reaches, lake, albert, although, it, is, a, part, of, the, same, river, system, known, as, the, white, nile, and, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, such, strictly, speaking, this, name, does, not, apply, until, after, the, river, crosses, the, uganda, border, into, south, sudan, to, the, north, the, lake, exhibits, eutrophic, conditions, in, 1990, 1991, oxygen, concentrations, in, the, mixed, layer, were, higher, than, in, 1960, 1961, with, nearly, continuous, oxygen, supersaturation, in, surface, waters, oxygen, concentrations, in, hypolimnetic, waters, i, e, the, layer, of, water, that, lies, below, the, thermocline, is, noncirculating, and, remains, perpetually, cold, were, lower, in, 1990, 1991, for, a, longer, period, than, in, 1960, 1961, with, values, of, less, than, 1, mg, per, litre, 0, 4, gr, cu, ft, occurring, in, water, as, shallow, as, 40, metres, 130, ft, compared, with, a, shallowest, occurrence, of, greater, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, in, 1961, the, changes, in, oxygenation, are, considered, consistent, with, measurements, of, higher, algal, biomass, and, productivity, these, changes, have, arisen, for, multiple, reasons, successive, burning, within, its, basin, soot, and, ash, from, which, has, been, deposited, over, the, lake, s, wide, area, from, increased, nutrient, inflows, via, rivers, and, from, increased, pollution, associated, with, settlement, along, its, shores, between, 2010, and, 2022, the, surface, area, of, lake, victoria, increased, by, 15, flooding, lakeside, communities, the, lake, is, considered, a, shallow, lake, considering, its, large, geographic, area, with, a, maximum, depth, of, approximately, 80, metres, 260, ft, and, an, average, depth, of, 40, metres, 130, ft, a, 2016, project, digitized, ten, thousand, points, and, created, the, first, true, bathymetric, map, of, the, lake, the, deepest, part, of, the, lake, is, offset, to, the, east, of, the, lake, near, kenya, and, the, lake, is, generally, shallower, in, the, west, along, the, ugandan, shoreline, and, the, south, along, the, tanzanian, shoreline, many, mammal, species, live, in, the, region, of, lake, victoria, and, some, of, these, are, closely, associated, with, the, lake, itself, and, the, nearby, wetlands, among, these, are, the, hippopotamus, african, clawless, otter, spotted, necked, otter, marsh, mongoose, sitatunga, bohor, reedbuck, defassa, waterbuck, cane, rats, and, giant, otter, shrew, lake, victoria, and, its, wetlands, has, a, large, population, of, nile, crocodiles, as, well, as, african, helmeted, turtles, variable, mud, turtles, and, williams, mud, turtle, the, williams, mud, turtle, is, restricted, to, lake, victoria, and, other, lakes, rivers, and, swamps, in, the, upper, nile, basin, lake, victoria, formerly, was, very, rich, in, fish, including, many, endemics, but, a, high, percentage, of, these, became, extinct, since, the, 1940s, the, main, group, in, lake, victoria, is, the, haplochromine, cichlids, haplochromis, sensu, lato, with, more, than, 500, species, almost, all, endemic, and, including, an, estimated, 300, that, still, are, undescribed, this, is, far, more, species, of, fish, than, any, other, lake, in, the, world, except, lake, malawi, these, are, the, result, of, a, rapid, adaptive, radiation, in, the, last, circa, 15, 000, years, their, extraordinary, diversity, and, speed, of, evolution, have, been, the, subjects, for, many, scientists, studying, the, forces, that, drive, the, richness, of, life, everywhere, the, victoria, haplochromines, are, part, of, an, older, group, of, more, than, 700, closely, related, species, also, including, those, of, several, smaller, lakes, in, the, region, notably, kyoga, edward, george, albert, and, kivu, most, of, these, lakes, are, relatively, shallow, like, victoria, and, part, of, the, present, day, upper, nile, basin, the, exception, is, lake, kivu, which, is, part, of, the, present, day, congo, river, basin, but, is, believed, to, have, been, connected, to, lakes, edward, and, victoria, by, rivers, until, the, uplifting, of, parts, of, the, east, african, rift, this, deep, lake, may, have, functioned, as, an, evolutionary, reservoir, for, this, haplochromine, group, in, periods, where, other, shallower, lakes, in, the, region, dried, out, as, happened, to, lake, victoria, about, 15, 000, years, ago, in, recent, history, only, lake, kyoga, was, easily, accessible, to, victoria, cichlids, as, further, downstream, movement, by, the, victoria, nile, to, lake, albert, is, prevented, by, a, series, of, waterfalls, notably, murchison, in, contrast, the, owen, falls, now, flooded, by, a, dam, between, victoria, and, kyoga, were, essentially, a, series, of, rapids, that, did, not, effectively, block, fish, movements, between, the, two, lakes, the, victoria, haplochromines, are, distinctly, sexually, dimorphic, males, relatively, brightly, colored, females, dull, and, their, ecology, is, extremely, diverse, falling, into, at, least, 16, groups, including, detritivores, zooplanktivores, insectivores, prawn, eaters, molluscivores, and, piscivores, as, a, result, of, predation, by, the, introduced, nile, perch, eutrophication, and, other, changes, to, the, ecosystem, it, is, estimated, that, at, least, 200, species, about, 40, percent, of, lake, victoria, haplochromines, have, become, extinct, including, more, than, 100, undescribed, species, initially, it, was, feared, that, this, number, was, even, higher, by, some, estimates, 65, percent, of, the, total, species, but, several, species, that, were, feared, extinct, have, been, rediscovered, after, the, nile, perch, started, to, decline, in, the, 1990s, several, of, the, remaining, species, are, seriously, threatened, and, additional, extinctions, are, possible, some, species, have, survived, in, nearby, small, satellite, lakes, have, survived, in, refugias, among, rocks, or, papyrus, sedges, protecting, them, from, the, nile, perch, or, have, adapted, to, the, human, induced, changes, in, the, lake, itself, such, adaptions, include, a, larger, gill, area, adaption, for, oxygen, poor, water, changes, in, the, feeding, apparatus, changes, to, the, eyes, giving, them, better, sight, in, turbid, water, and, smaller, head, larger, caudal, peduncle, allowing, faster, swimming, the, piscivorous, affected, by, both, predation, and, competition, from, nile, perch, molluscivorous, and, insectivorous, haplochromines, were, particularly, hard, hit, with, many, extinctions, others, have, become, extinct, in, their, pure, form, but, survive, as, hybrids, between, close, relatives, especially, among, the, detritivores, the, zooplanktivores, have, been, least, affected, and, in, the, late, 1990s, had, reached, densities, similar, to, or, above, the, densities, before, the, drastic, declines, although, consisting, of, fewer, species, and, often, switching, their, diet, towards, macroinvertebrates, some, of, the, threatened, lake, victoria, cichlid, species, have, captive, insurance, populations, in, zoos, public, aquaria, and, among, private, aquarists, and, a, few, species, are, extinct, in, the, wild, only, survive, in, captivity, before, the, mass, extinction, that, has, occurred, among, the, lake, s, cichlids, in, the, last, 50, years, about, 90, percent, of, the, native, fish, species, in, the, lake, were, haplochromines, disregarding, the, haplochromines, the, only, native, victoria, cichlids, are, two, critically, endangered, tilapia, the, singida, tilapia, or, ngege, oreochromis, esculentus, and, victoria, tilapia, o, variabilis, in, 1927, 1928, michael, graham, conducted, the, first, ever, systematic, fisheries, survey, of, lake, victoria, in, his, official, report, of, the, expedition, graham, wrote, that, the, ngege, or, satu, tilapia, esculenta, is, the, most, important, food, fish, of, the, lake, whether, for, native, or, non, native, consumption, no, other, fish, equals, it, in, the, quality, of, the, flesh, it, is, convenient, size, for, trade, travels, well, and, is, found, in, much, greater, numbers, than, other, important, fish, such, as, semutundu, luganda, bagrus, sp, furthermore, graham, noted, that, the, introduction, of, the, european, flax, gill, net, of, 5, inch, mesh, had, undoubtedly, caused, a, diminution, in, the, number, of, ngege, in, those, parts, of, the, kavirondo, gulf, the, northern, shore, of, the, lake, the, sesse, islands, and, smith, s, sound, which, are, conveniently, situated, close, to, markets, survey, catches, in, 1927, 28, included, several, haplochromis, species, that, are, now, thought, to, be, extinct, including, haplochromis, flavipinnis, haplochromis, gowersii, haplochromis, longirostris, haplochromis, macrognathus, haplochromis, michaeli, haplochromis, nigrescens, haplochromis, prognathus, as, well, as, being, due, to, the, introduction, of, nile, perch, the, extinction, of, cichlids, in, the, genus, haplochromis, has, also, been, blamed, on, the, lake, s, eutrophication, the, fertility, of, tropical, waters, depends, on, the, rate, at, which, nutrients, can, be, brought, into, solution, the, influent, rivers, of, lake, victoria, provide, few, nutrients, to, the, lake, in, relation, to, its, size, because, of, this, most, of, lake, victoria, s, nutrients, are, thought, to, be, locked, up, in, lake, bottom, deposits, by, itself, this, vegetative, matter, decays, slowly, animal, flesh, decays, considerably, faster, however, so, the, fertility, of, the, lake, is, dependent, on, the, rate, at, which, these, nutrients, can, be, taken, up, by, fish, and, other, organisms, there, is, little, doubt, that, haplochromis, played, an, important, role, in, returning, detritus, and, plankton, back, into, solution, with, some, 80, percent, of, haplochromis, species, feeding, off, detritus, and, equally, capable, of, feeding, off, one, another, they, represented, a, tight, internal, recycling, system, moving, nutrients, and, biomass, both, vertically, and, horizontally, through, the, water, column, and, even, out, of, the, lake, via, predation, by, humans, and, terrestrial, animals, the, removal, of, haplochromis, however, may, have, contributed, to, the, increasing, frequency, of, algal, blooms, which, may, in, turn, be, responsible, for, mass, fish, kills, the, non, cichlid, native, fish, include, african, tetras, brycinus, cyprinids, enteromius, garra, labeo, labeobarbus, rastrineobola, and, xenobarbus, airbreathing, catfish, clariallabes, clarias, and, xenoclarias, bagrid, catfish, bagrus, loach, catfish, amphilius, and, zaireichthys, silver, butter, catfish, schilbe, intermedius, synodontis, squeaker, catfish, nothobranchius, killifish, poeciliids, aplocheilichthys, and, micropanchax, the, spiny, eel, mastacembelus, frenatus, elephantfish, gnathonemus, hippopotamyrus, marcusenius, mormyrus, petrocephalus, and, pollimyrus, the, climbing, gourami, ctenopoma, muriei, and, marbled, lungfish, protopterus, aethiopicus, at, a, genus, level, most, of, these, are, widespread, in, africa, but, the, very, rare, xenobarbus, and, xenoclarias, are, endemic, to, the, lake, and, the, common, rastrineobola, is, near, endemic, four, species, of, freshwater, crabs, are, known, from, lake, victoria, potamonautes, niloticus, is, widespread, in, the, lake, and, p, emini, has, been, recorded, from, the, vicinity, of, bukoba, in, tanzania, but, both, are, also, found, elsewhere, in, africa, the, last, were, first, scientifically, described, in, 2017, and, very, little, is, known, about, them, p, entebbe, is, only, known, from, near, entebbe, the, only, known, specimen, was, collected, in, 1955, and, it, is, unknown, if, it, was, in, or, near, the, lake, and, p, busungwe, only, at, busungwe, island, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, lake, the, latter, likely, is, the, smallest, african, freshwater, crab, with, a, carapace, width, up, to, about, 1, 6, cm, 0, 6, in, although, p, kantsyore, of, kagera, river, and, platythelphusa, maculata, and, p, polita, of, lake, tanganyika, are, almost, as, small, the, only, shrimp, prawn, is, caridina, nilotica, which, is, common, and, widespread, in, lake, victoria, lake, victoria, is, home, to, 28, species, of, freshwater, snails, e, g, bellamya, biomphalaria, bulinus, cleopatra, gabbiella, and, melanoides, including, 12, endemic, species, subspecies, there, are, 17, species, of, bivalves, corbicula, coelatura, sphaerium, and, byssanodonta, including, 6, endemic, species, and, subspecies, it, is, likely, that, undescribed, species, of, snails, remain, conversely, genetic, studies, indicate, that, some, morphologically, distinctive, populations, traditionally, regarded, as, separate, species, may, only, be, variants, of, single, species, two, of, the, snail, genera, biomphalaria, and, bulinus, are, intermediate, hosts, of, the, parasite, that, causes, bilharzia, schistosomiasis, human, infections, by, this, parasite, are, common, at, lake, victoria, this, may, increase, as, a, result, of, the, spread, of, the, invasive, water, hyacinth, an, optimum, snail, habitat, and, the, loss, of, many, snail, eating, cichlids, in, the, lake, evarcha, culicivora, is, a, species, of, jumping, spider, family, salticidae, found, only, around, lake, victoria, in, kenya, and, uganda, it, feeds, primarily, on, female, mosquitos, lake, victoria, supports, africa, s, largest, inland, fishery, as, of, 1997, initially, the, fishery, involved, native, species, especially, tilapia, and, haplochromine, cichlids, but, also, catfish, bagrus, clarias, synodontis, and, silver, butter, catfish, elephantfish, ningu, labeo, victorianus, and, marbled, lungfish, protopterus, aethiopicus, some, of, these, including, tilapia, and, ningu, labeo, victorianus, had, already, declined, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, overfishing, to, boost, fishing, several, species, of, non, native, tilapia, and, nile, perch, were, introduced, to, the, lake, in, the, 1950s, nevertheless, the, natives, continued, to, dominate, fisheries, until, the, 1970s, where, their, decline, meant, that, there, was, a, strong, shift, towards, the, non, native, nile, tilapia, now, 7, percent, of, catches, non, native, nile, perch, 60, percent, and, the, native, lake, victoria, sardine, 30, percent, because, of, its, small, size, the, abundant, open, water, lake, victoria, sardine, only, supported, minor, fisheries, until, the, decline, of, other, natives, at, the, peak, in, the, early, 1990s, 500, 000, tonnes, 490, 000, long, tons, 550, 000, short, tons, of, nile, perch, were, landed, annually, in, lake, victoria, but, this, has, declined, significantly, in, later, years, a, number, of, environmental, issues, are, associated, with, lake, victoria, and, the, complete, disappearance, of, many, endemic, cichlid, species, has, been, called, the, most, dramatic, example, of, human, caused, extinctions, within, an, ecosystem, starting, in, the, 1950s, many, species, have, been, introduced, to, lake, victoria, where, they, have, become, invasive, and, a, prime, reason, for, the, extinction, of, many, endemic, haplochromine, cichlids, among, the, introductions, are, several, tilapias, redbreast, coptodon, rendalli, redbelly, c, zillii, nile, oreochromis, niloticus, and, blue, spotted, tilapias, o, leucostictus, although, these, have, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, native, fish, by, causing, significant, changes, to, the, ecosystem, outcompeted, natives, and, in, the, case, of, the, nile, tilapia, possibly, hybridized, with, the, highly, threatened, native, tilapias, the, most, infamous, introduction, was, the, large, and, highly, predatory, nile, perch, lates, niloticus, as, early, as, the, 1920s, it, was, proposed, to, introduce, a, large, pelagic, predator, such, as, the, nile, perch, to, improve, the, fisheries, in, the, lake, at, the, same, time, it, was, warned, that, this, could, present, a, serious, danger, to, the, native, fish, species, and, required, extensive, research, into, possible, ecological, effects, before, done, these, warnings, primarily, concerned, the, native, tilapia, o, esculentus, as, the, smaller, haplochromine, cichlids, despite, playing, an, important, role, in, local, fisheries, were, regarded, as, trash, fish, by, the, colonial, government, in, the, following, decades, the, pressure, to, introduce, the, nile, perch, continued, as, did, warnings, about, the, possible, effects, of, doing, it, the, first, introduction, of, nile, perch, to, the, region, done, by, the, uganda, game, and, fisheries, department, then, part, of, the, colonial, government, and, local, african, fish, guards, happened, upstream, of, murchison, falls, directly, after, the, completion, of, the, owen, falls, dam, in, 1954, this, allowed, it, to, spread, to, lake, kyoga, where, additional, nile, perch, were, released, in, 1955, but, not, victoria, itself, scientists, argued, that, further, introduction, should, wait, until, research, showed, the, effect, of, the, introduction, in, kyoga, but, by, the, late, 1950s, nile, perch, began, being, caught, in, lake, victoria, as, the, species, was, already, present, there, were, few, objections, when, more, nile, perch, were, transferred, to, victoria, to, further, bolster, the, stock, in, 1962, 63, the, origin, of, the, first, victoria, introductions, in, the, 1950s, is, not, entirely, clear, and, indisputable, evidence, is, lacking, uganda, game, and, fisheries, department, ugfd, officials, denied, that, they, were, involved, but, circumstantial, evidence, suggests, otherwise, and, local, africans, employed, by, ugfd, have, said, that, they, introduced, the, species, in, 1954, 55, under, the, directive, of, senior, officials, ugfd, officials, argued, that, nile, perch, must, have, spread, to, lake, victoria, by, themselves, by, passing, through, the, owen, falls, dam, when, shut, down, for, maintenance, but, this, is, considered, highly, unlikely, by, many, scientists, the, nile, perch, had, spread, throughout, the, lake, by, 1970, initially, the, population, of, the, nile, perch, was, relatively, low, but, a, drastic, increase, happened, peaking, in, the, 1980s, followed, by, a, decline, starting, in, the, 1990s, due, to, the, presence, of, the, nile, perch, the, natural, balance, of, the, lake, s, ecosystem, has, been, disrupted, the, food, chain, is, being, altered, and, in, some, cases, broken, by, the, indiscriminate, eating, habits, of, the, nile, perch, the, subsequent, decrease, in, the, number, of, algae, eating, fish, allows, the, algae, to, grow, at, an, alarming, rate, thereby, choking, the, lake, the, increasing, amounts, of, algae, in, turn, increase, the, amount, of, detritus, dead, plant, material, that, falls, to, the, deeper, portions, of, the, lake, before, decomposing, as, a, by, product, of, this, the, oxygen, levels, in, the, deeper, layer, of, water, are, being, depleted, without, oxygen, any, aerobic, life, such, as, fish, cannot, exist, in, the, deeper, parts, of, the, lake, forcing, all, life, to, exist, within, a, narrow, range, of, depth, in, this, way, the, nile, perch, has, degraded, the, diverse, and, thriving, ecosystem, that, was, once, lake, victoria, the, abundance, of, aquatic, life, is, not, the, only, dependent, of, the, lake, more, than, thirty, million, people, in, tanzania, kenya, and, uganda, rely, on, the, lake, for, its, natural, resources, hundreds, of, endemic, species, that, evolved, under, the, special, conditions, offered, by, the, protection, of, lake, victoria, have, been, lost, due, to, extinction, and, several, more, are, still, threatened, their, loss, is, devastating, for, the, lake, the, fields, of, ecology, genetics, and, evolution, biology, and, more, evidently, for, the, local, fisheries, local, fisheries, once, depended, on, catching, the, lungfish, tilapia, carp, and, catfish, that, comprise, the, local, diet, today, the, composition, and, yields, of, such, fish, catches, are, virtually, negligible, extensive, fish, kills, nile, perch, loss, of, habitat, and, overfishing, have, caused, many, fisheries, to, collapse, and, many, protein, sources, to, be, unavailable, at, the, market, for, local, consumption, few, fisheries, though, have, been, able, to, make, the, switch, to, catching, the, nile, perch, since, that, requires, a, significant, amount, of, capital, resources, the, water, hyacinth, has, become, a, major, invasive, plant, species, in, lake, victoria, the, release, of, large, amounts, of, untreated, wastewater, sewage, and, agricultural, and, industrial, runoff, directly, into, lake, victoria, over, the, past, 30, years, has, greatly, increased, the, nutrient, levels, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, in, the, lake, triggering, massive, growth, of, exotic, water, hyacinth, which, colonised, the, lake, in, the, late, 1990s, this, invasive, weed, creates, anoxic, total, depletion, of, oxygen, levels, conditions, in, the, lake, inhibiting, decomposing, plant, material, raising, toxicity, and, disease, levels, to, both, fish, and, people, at, the, same, time, the, plant, s, mat, or, web, creates, a, barrier, for, boats, and, ferries, to, maneuver, impedes, access, to, the, shoreline, interferes, with, hydroelectric, power, generation, and, blocks, the, intake, of, water, for, industries, on, the, other, hand, water, hyacinth, mats, can, potentially, have, a, positive, effect, on, fish, life, in, that, they, create, a, barrier, to, overfishing, and, allow, for, fish, growth, there, has, even, been, the, reappearance, of, some, fish, species, thought, to, have, been, extinct, in, recent, years, the, overall, effects, of, the, water, hyacinth, however, are, still, unknown, growth, of, the, water, hyacinth, in, lake, victoria, has, been, tracked, since, 1993, reaching, its, maxima, biomass, in, 1997, and, then, declining, again, by, the, end, of, 2001, greater, growth, was, observed, in, the, northern, part, of, the, lake, in, relatively, protected, areas, which, may, be, linked, to, current, and, weather, patterns, and, could, also, be, due, to, the, climate, and, water, conditions, which, are, more, suitable, to, the, plants, growth, as, there, are, large, urban, areas, to, the, north, end, of, the, lake, in, uganda, the, invasive, weed, was, first, attempted, to, be, controlled, by, hand, removed, manually, from, the, lake, however, re, growth, occurred, quickly, public, awareness, exercises, were, also, conducted, more, recently, measures, have, been, used, such, as, the, introduction, of, natural, insect, predators, including, two, different, water, hyacinth, weevils, and, large, harvesting, and, chopping, boats, which, seem, to, be, much, more, effective, in, eliminating, the, water, hyacinth, a, green, power, plant, that, uses, harvested, water, hyacinth, but, also, can, use, other, degradable, waste, was, constructed, in, kisumu, county, in, 2013, in, addition, to, the, biogas, it, produces, its, by, product, can, be, used, as, fertilizer, other, factors, which, may, have, contributed, to, the, decline, of, the, water, hyacinth, in, lake, victoria, include, varying, weather, patterns, such, as, el, ni, o, during, the, last, few, months, of, 1997, and, first, six, months, of, 1998, bringing, with, it, higher, levels, of, water, in, the, lake, and, thus, dislodging, the, plants, heavy, winds, and, rains, along, with, their, subsequent, waves, may, have, also, damaged, the, plants, during, this, same, time, frame, the, plants, may, not, have, been, destroyed, instead, merely, moved, to, another, location, additionally, the, water, quality, nutrient, supply, temperature, and, other, environmental, factors, could, have, played, a, role, overall, the, timing, of, the, decline, could, be, linked, to, all, of, these, factors, and, perhaps, together, in, combination, they, were, more, effective, than, any, one, deterrent, would, have, been, by, itself, the, water, hyacinth, is, in, remission, and, this, trend, could, be, permanent, if, control, efforts, are, continued, pollution, of, lake, victoria, is, mainly, due, to, discharge, of, raw, sewage, into, the, lake, dumping, of, domestic, and, industrial, waste, and, fertiliser, and, chemicals, from, farms, the, lake, victoria, basin, while, generally, rural, has, many, major, centres, of, population, its, shores, are, dotted, with, key, cities, and, towns, including, kisumu, kisii, and, homa, bay, in, kenya, kampala, jinja, and, entebbe, in, uganda, and, bukoba, mwanza, and, musoma, in, tanzania, these, cities, and, towns, are, also, home, to, many, factories, that, discharge, some, chemicals, directly, into, the, lake, or, its, influent, rivers, the, set, up, of, small, beaches, and, local, authorities, around, the, lake, lack, proper, sewage, treatment, facilities, allowing, pollutants, to, find, their, way, into, the, water, large, parts, of, these, urban, areas, also, discharge, untreated, raw, sewage, into, the, river, increasing, its, eutrophication, that, in, turn, is, helping, to, increase, the, invasive, water, hyacinth, increased, logging, and, act, of, deforestation, has, led, to, environmental, degradation, around, the, region, reducing, the, absorption, of, polluting, chemicals, and, deteriorating, the, water, quality, as, of, 2016, an, environmental, data, repository, exists, for, lake, victoria, the, repository, contains, shoreline, bathymetry, pollution, temperature, wind, vector, and, other, important, data, for, both, the, lake, and, the, wider, basin, the, first, recorded, information, about, lake, victoria, comes, from, arab, traders, plying, the, inland, routes, in, search, of, gold, ivory, other, precious, commodities, and, slaves, the, lake, existed, and, was, known, to, many, africans, in, the, catchment, area, who, left, no, written, records, long, before, it, was, sighted, by, a, european, in, 1858, when, the, british, explorer, john, hanning, speke, reached, its, southern, shore, while, on, his, journey, with, richard, francis, burton, to, explore, central, africa, and, locate, the, great, lakes, believing, he, had, found, the, source, of, the, nile, on, seeing, this, vast, expanse, of, open, water, for, the, first, time, speke, named, the, lake, after, queen, victoria, burton, who, had, been, recovering, from, illness, at, the, time, and, resting, further, south, in, kazeh, near, present, day, tabora, was, outraged, that, speke, claimed, to, have, proved, his, discovery, to, have, been, the, true, source, of, the, nile, river, which, burton, regarded, as, still, unsettled, a, very, public, quarrel, ensued, which, not, only, sparked, a, great, deal, of, intense, debate, within, the, scientific, community, of, the, day, but, also, much, interest, by, other, explorers, keen, to, either, confirm, or, refute, speke, s, discovery, in, the, late, 1860s, the, famous, scottish, explorer, and, missionary, david, livingstone, failed, in, his, attempt, to, verify, speke, s, discovery, instead, pushing, too, far, west, and, entering, the, river, congo, system, instead, ultimately, the, welsh, american, explorer, henry, morton, stanley, on, an, expedition, funded, by, the, new, york, herald, newspaper, confirmed, the, truth, of, speke, s, discovery, circumnavigating, the, lake, and, reporting, the, great, outflow, at, ripon, falls, on, the, lake, s, northern, shore, the, only, outflow, for, lake, victoria, is, at, jinja, uganda, where, it, forms, the, victoria, nile, the, water, for, at, least, 12, 000, years, has, drained, across, a, natural, rock, weir, in, 1952, engineers, acting, for, the, government, of, colonial, uganda, blasted, out, the, weir, and, reservoir, to, replace, it, with, an, artificial, barrage, to, control, the, level, of, the, lake, and, reduce, the, gradual, erosion, of, the, rock, weir, a, standard, for, mimicking, the, old, rate, of, outflow, called, the, agreed, curve, was, established, setting, the, maximum, flow, rate, at, 300, to, 1, 700, cubic, metres, per, second, 392, 2, 224, cu, yd, sec, depending, on, the, lake, s, water, level, in, 2002, uganda, completed, a, second, hydroelectric, complex, in, the, area, the, kiira, hydroelectric, power, station, with, world, bank, assistance, by, 2006, the, water, levels, in, lake, victoria, had, reached, an, 80, year, low, and, daniel, kull, an, independent, hydrologist, living, in, nairobi, kenya, calculated, that, uganda, was, releasing, about, twice, as, much, water, as, is, allowed, under, the, agreement, and, was, primarily, responsible, for, recent, drops, in, the, lake, s, level, many, towns, and, cities, are, reliant, on, lake, victoria, for, their, water, supplies, for, farming, and, other, uses, the, lamadi, water, scheme, is, a, water, and, sanitation, project, that, serves, mwanza, and, the, satellite, towns, of, lamadi, misungwi, magu, bukoba, and, musoma, on, the, bank, of, lake, victoria, european, investment, bank, started, the, project, in, 2013, with, the, aim, of, protecting, the, environmental, health, of, the, lake, through, improved, water, and, sanitation, to, the, towns, whose, pollution, is, part, of, the, degradation, of, the, lake, the, project, aims, to, provide, safe, drinking, water, for, an, estimated, one, million, people, and, improved, sanitation, for, 100, 000, people, sediment, and, suspended, solids, are, filtered, out, using, sand, which, acts, like, a, sieve, the, water, is, then, ready, to, be, chlorinated, or, treated, in, another, way, the, sand, filtration, helps, reduce, water, borne, diseases, and, is, based, on, the, use, of, the, local, environment, since, the, 1900s, lake, victoria, ferries, have, been, an, important, means, of, transport, between, uganda, tanzania, and, kenya, the, main, ports, on, the, lake, are, kisumu, mwanza, bukoba, entebbe, port, bell, and, jinja, until, 1963, the, fastest, and, newest, ferry, mv, victoria, was, designated, a, royal, mail, ship, in, 1966, train, ferry, services, between, kenya, and, tanzania, were, established, with, the, introduction, of, mv, uhuru, and, mv, umoja, the, ferry, mv, bukoba, sank, in, the, lake, on, 21, may, 1996, with, a, loss, of, between, 800, and, 1, 000, lives, making, it, one, of, africa, s, worst, maritime, disasters, another, tragedy, occurred, recently, on, 20, september, 2018, that, involved, the, passagers, ferry, mv, nyerere, from, tanzania, that, caused, the, deaths, of, over, 200, people, on, 6, november, 2022, lake, victoria, was, the, site, of, a, commercial, passenger, aircraft, crash, precision, air, flight, 494, an, atr, 42, 500, carrying, 39, passengers, and, four, crew,
