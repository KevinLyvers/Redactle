emerged, as, a, relatively, stable, authoritarian, republic, in, the, 1830s, after, their, 1818, declaration, of, independence, from, spain, during, the, 19th, century, chile, experienced, significant, economic, and, territorial, growth, putting, an, end, to, mapuche, resistance, in, the, 1880s, and, gaining, its, current, northern, territory, in, the, war, of, the, pacific, 1879, 83, by, defeating, peru, and, bolivia, in, the, 20th, century, up, until, the, 1970s, chile, underwent, a, process, of, democratization, and, experienced, rapid, population, growth, and, urbanization, while, relying, increasingly, on, exports, from, copper, mining, to, support, its, economy, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, country, was, marked, by, severe, left, right, political, polarization, and, turmoil, which, culminated, in, the, 1973, chilean, coup, d, tat, that, overthrew, salvador, allende, s, democratically, elected, left, wing, government, this, was, followed, by, a, 16, year, right, wing, military, dictatorship, under, augusto, pinochet, which, resulted, in, more, than, 3, 000, deaths, or, disappearances, the, regime, ended, in, 1990, following, a, referendum, in, 1988, and, was, succeeded, by, a, center, left, coalition, which, ruled, until, 2010, chile, is, a, developing, country, with, a, high, income, economy, and, is, one, of, the, most, economically, and,

founding, member, of, the, united, nations, the, community, of, latin, american, and, caribbean, states, celac, and, the, pacific, alliance, and, joined, the, oecd, in, 2010, there, are, various, theories, about, the, origin, of, the, word, chile, according, to, 17th, century, spanish, chronicler, diego, de, rosales, the, incas, called, the, valley, of, the, aconcagua, chili, by, corruption, of, the, name, of, a, picunche, tribal, chief, cacique, called, tili, who, ruled, the, area, at, the, time, of, the, incan, conquest, in, the, 15th, century, another, theory, points, to, the, similarity, of, the, valley, of, the, aconcagua, with, that, of, the, casma, valley, in, peru, where, there, was, a, town, and, valley, named, chili, other, theories, say, chile, may, derive, its, name, from, a, native, american, word, meaning, either, ends, of, the, earth, or, sea, gulls, from, the, mapuche, word, chilli, which, may, mean, where, the, land, ends, or, from, the, quechua, chiri, cold, or, tchili, meaning, either, snow, or, the, deepest, point, of, the, earth, another, origin, attributed, to, chilli, is, the, onomatopoeic, cheele, cheele, the, mapuche, imitation, of, the, warble, of, a, bird, locally, known, as, trile, the, spanish, conquistadors, heard, about, this, name, from, the, incas, and, the, few, survivors, of, diego, de, almagro, s, first, spanish, expedition, south, from, peru, in, 1535, 36, called, themselves, the, men, of, chilli, ultimately, almagro, is, credited, with, the, universalization, of, the, name, chile, after, naming, the, mapocho, valley, as, such, the, older, spelling, chili, was, in, use, in, english, until, the, early, 20th, century, before, switching, to, chile, stone, tool, evidence, indicates, humans, sporadically, frequented, the, monte, verde, valley, area, as, long, as, 18, 500, years, ago, about, 10, 000, years, ago, migrating, indigenous, peoples, settled, in, fertile, valleys, and, coastal, areas, of, what, is, present, day, chile, settlement, sites, from, very, early, human, habitation, include, monte, verde, cueva, del, milod, n, and, the, pali, aike, crater, s, lava, tube, the, incas, briefly, extended, their, empire, into, what, is, now, northern, chile, but, the, mapuche, or, araucanians, as, they, were, known, by, the, spaniards, successfully, resisted, many, attempts, by, the, inca, empire, to, subjugate, them, despite, their, lack, of, state, organization, they, fought, against, the, sapa, inca, tupac, yupanqui, and, his, army, the, result, of, the, bloody, three, day, confrontation, known, as, the, battle, of, the, maule, was, that, the, inca, conquest, of, the, territories, of, chile, ended, at, the, maule, river, in, 1520, while, attempting, to, circumnavigate, the, globe, ferdinand, magellan, discovered, the, southern, passage, now, named, after, him, the, strait, of, magellan, thus, becoming, the, first, european, to, set, foot, on, what, is, now, chile, the, next, europeans, to, reach, chile, were, diego, de, almagro, and, his, band, of, spanish, conquistadors, who, came, from, peru, in, 1535, seeking, gold, the, spanish, encountered, various, cultures, that, supported, themselves, principally, through, slash, and, burn, agriculture, and, hunting, the, conquest, of, chile, began, in, earnest, in, 1540, and, was, carried, out, by, pedro, de, valdivia, one, of, francisco, pizarro, s, lieutenants, who, founded, the, city, of, santiago, on, 12, february, 1541, although, the, spanish, did, not, find, the, extensive, gold, and, silver, they, sought, they, recognized, the, agricultural, potential, of, chile, s, central, valley, and, chile, became, part, of, the, spanish, empire, conquest, took, place, gradually, and, the, europeans, suffered, repeated, setbacks, a, massive, mapuche, insurrection, that, began, in, 1553, resulted, in, valdivia, s, death, and, the, destruction, of, many, of, the, colony, s, principal, settlements, subsequent, major, insurrections, took, place, in, 1598, and, in, 1655, each, time, the, mapuche, and, other, native, groups, revolted, the, southern, border, of, the, colony, was, driven, northward, the, abolition, of, slavery, by, the, spanish, crown, in, 1683, was, done, in, recognition, that, enslaving, the, mapuche, intensified, resistance, rather, than, cowing, them, into, submission, despite, royal, prohibitions, relations, remained, strained, from, continual, colonialist, interference, cut, off, to, the, north, by, desert, to, the, south, by, the, mapuche, to, the, east, by, the, andes, mountains, and, to, the, west, by, the, ocean, chile, became, one, of, the, most, centralized, homogeneous, territories, in, spanish, america, serving, as, a, sort, of, frontier, garrison, the, colony, found, itself, with, the, mission, of, forestalling, encroachment, by, both, the, mapuche, and, spain, s, european, enemies, especially, the, english, and, the, dutch, buccaneers, and, pirates, menaced, the, colony, in, addition, to, the, mapuche, as, was, shown, by, sir, francis, drake, s, 1578, raid, on, valpara, so, the, colony, s, principal, port, chile, hosted, one, of, the, largest, standing, armies, in, the, americas, making, it, one, of, the, most, militarized, of, the, spanish, possessions, as, well, as, a, drain, on, the, treasury, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, the, first, general, census, was, conducted, by, the, government, of, agust, n, de, j, uregui, between, 1777, and, 1778, it, indicated, that, the, population, consisted, of, 259, 646, inhabitants, 73, 5, of, european, descent, 7, 9, mestizos, 8, 6, indigenous, peoples, and, 9, 8, blacks, francisco, hurtado, governor, of, the, province, of, chilo, conducted, a, census, in, 1784, and, found, the, population, consisted, of, 26, 703, inhabitants, 64, 4, of, whom, were, whites, and, 33, 5, of, whom, were, natives, the, diocese, of, concepci, n, conducted, a, census, in, areas, south, of, the, maule, river, in, 1812, but, did, not, include, the, indigenous, population, or, the, inhabitants, of, the, province, of, chilo, the, population, is, estimated, at, 210, 567, 86, 1, of, whom, were, spanish, or, of, european, descent, 10, of, whom, were, indigenous, and, 3, 7, of, whom, were, mestizos, blacks, and, mulattos, a, 2021, study, by, baten, and, llorca, ja, a, shows, that, regions, with, a, relatively, high, share, of, north, european, migrants, developed, faster, in, terms, of, numeracy, even, if, the, overall, number, of, migrants, was, small, this, effect, might, be, related, to, externalities, the, surrounding, population, adopted, a, similar, behavior, as, the, small, non, european, immigrant, group, and, new, schools, were, created, ironically, there, might, have, been, positive, spillover, effects, from, the, educational, investment, made, by, migrants, at, the, same, time, numeracy, might, have, been, reduced, by, the, greater, inequality, in, these, regions, however, the, positive, effects, of, immigration, were, apparently, stronger, in, 1808, napoleon, s, enthronement, of, his, brother, joseph, as, the, spanish, king, precipitated, the, drive, by, chile, for, independence, from, spain, a, national, junta, in, the, name, of, ferdinand, heir, to, the, deposed, king, was, formed, on, 18, september, 1810, the, government, junta, of, chile, proclaimed, an, autonomous, government, for, chile, within, the, spanish, monarchy, in, memory, of, this, day, chile, celebrates, its, national, day, on, 18, september, each, year, after, these, events, a, movement, for, total, independence, under, the, command, of, jos, miguel, carrera, one, of, the, most, renowned, patriots, and, his, two, brothers, juan, jos, and, luis, carrera, soon, gained, a, wider, following, spanish, attempts, to, re, impose, arbitrary, rule, during, what, was, called, the, reconquista, led, to, a, prolonged, struggle, including, infighting, from, bernardo, o, higgins, who, challenged, carrera, s, leadership, intermittent, warfare, continued, until, 1817, with, carrera, in, prison, in, argentina, o, higgins, and, anti, carrera, cohort, jos, de, san, mart, n, hero, of, the, argentine, war, of, independence, led, an, army, that, crossed, the, andes, into, chile, and, defeated, the, royalists, on, 12, february, 1818, chile, was, proclaimed, an, independent, republic, the, political, revolt, brought, little, social, change, however, and, 19th, century, chilean, society, preserved, the, essence, of, the, stratified, colonial, social, structure, which, was, greatly, influenced, by, family, politics, and, the, roman, catholic, church, a, strong, presidency, eventually, emerged, but, wealthy, landowners, remained, powerful, bernardo, o, higgins, once, planned, to, expand, chile, by, liberating, the, philippines, from, spain, and, incorporating, the, islands, in, this, regard, he, tasked, the, scottish, naval, officer, lord, thomas, cochrane, in, a, letter, dated, 12, november, 1821, expressing, his, plan, to, conquer, guayaquil, the, galapagos, islands, and, the, philippines, there, were, preparations, but, the, plan, did, not, push, through, because, o, higgins, was, exiled, chile, slowly, started, to, expand, its, influence, and, to, establish, its, borders, by, the, tantauco, treaty, the, archipelago, of, chilo, was, incorporated, in, 1826, the, economy, began, to, boom, due, to, the, discovery, of, silver, ore, in, cha, arcillo, and, the, growing, trade, of, the, port, of, valpara, so, which, led, to, conflict, over, maritime, supremacy, in, the, pacific, with, peru, at, the, same, time, attempts, were, made, to, strengthen, sovereignty, in, southern, chile, intensifying, penetration, into, araucan, a, and, colonizing, llanquihue, with, german, immigrants, in, 1848, through, the, founding, of, fort, bulnes, by, the, schooner, ancud, under, the, command, of, john, williams, wilson, the, magallanes, region, started, to, be, controlled, by, country, in, 1843, while, the, antofagasta, region, at, the, time, in, dispute, with, bolivia, began, to, fill, with, people, after, the, chilean, civil, war, of, 1829, 1830, in, which, the, conservatives, won, under, the, joaqu, n, prieto, administration, the, chilean, constitution, of, 1833, was, written, and, put, into, effect, with, high, influence, from, the, triple, minister, diego, portales, two, other, civil, wars, happened, in, chile, in, the, 1850s, one, in, 1851, and, the, other, one, in, 1859, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, government, in, santiago, consolidated, its, position, in, the, south, by, the, occupation, of, araucan, a, the, boundary, treaty, of, 1881, between, chile, and, argentina, confirmed, chilean, sovereignty, over, the, strait, of, magellan, but, also, made, the, country, to, renounce, to, its, claims, in, the, rest, of, east, patagonia, after, a, dispute, that, started, in, 1842, as, a, result, of, the, war, of, the, pacific, with, peru, and, bolivia, 1879, 83, chile, expanded, its, territory, northward, by, almost, one, third, eliminating, bolivia, s, access, to, the, pacific, and, acquired, valuable, nitrate, deposits, the, exploitation, of, which, led, to, an, era, of, national, affluence, chile, had, joined, the, stand, as, one, of, the, high, income, countries, in, south, america, by, 1870, on, 9, september, 1888, chile, took, possession, of, easter, island, by, the, signing, of, a, mutual, will, agreement, with, the, local, king, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, the, bishop, of, tahiti, monsignor, jos, mar, a, verdier, since, the, island, was, constantly, attacked, by, slave, merchants, the, naval, officer, policarpo, toro, represented, the, chilean, government, and, atamu, tekena, was, the, head, of, the, council, of, rapanui, the, rapa, nui, elders, ceded, sovereignty, without, renouncing, their, titles, as, chiefs, the, ownership, of, their, lands, the, validity, of, their, culture, and, traditions, and, on, equal, terms, the, rapa, nui, sold, nothing, they, were, integrated, in, equal, conditions, to, chile, the, 1891, chilean, civil, war, brought, about, a, redistribution, of, power, between, the, president, and, congress, and, chile, established, a, parliamentary, style, democracy, however, the, civil, war, had, also, been, a, contest, between, those, who, favored, the, development, of, local, industries, and, powerful, chilean, banking, interests, particularly, the, house, of, edwards, which, had, strong, ties, to, foreign, investors, soon, after, the, country, engaged, in, a, vastly, expensive, naval, arms, race, with, argentina, that, nearly, led, to, war, as, well, because, of, the, puna, de, atacama, dispute, after, the, war, of, the, pacific, chile, became, a, naval, power, in, the, americas, even, sending, a, ship, in, protests, in, the, panama, crisis, of, 1885, against, the, united, states, intervention, in, the, then, colombian, territory, the, united, states, and, chile, had, the, baltimore, crisis, which, almost, became, a, war, as, chile, was, a, potential, threat, to, the, intentions, of, hegemony, from, the, united, states, in, the, western, hemisphere, in, 1902, chile, and, argentina, received, the, result, from, the, arbitral, award, of, the, andes, resolved, by, the, british, crown, in, 1903, the, puna, de, atacama, dispute, was, solved, in, 1904, chile, and, bolivia, signed, a, treaty, of, peace, and, friendship, which, clarified, the, border, between, both, countries, the, chilean, economy, partially, degenerated, into, a, system, protecting, the, interests, of, a, ruling, oligarchy, by, the, 1920s, the, emerging, middle, and, working, classes, were, powerful, enough, to, elect, a, reformist, president, arturo, alessandri, whose, program, was, frustrated, by, a, conservative, congress, in, the, 1920s, marxist, groups, with, strong, popular, support, arose, a, military, coup, led, by, general, luis, altamirano, in, 1924, set, off, a, period, of, political, instability, that, lasted, until, 1932, of, the, ten, governments, that, held, power, in, that, period, the, longest, lasting, was, that, of, general, carlos, ib, ez, del, campo, who, briefly, held, power, in, 1925, and, then, again, between, 1927, and, 1931, in, what, was, a, de, facto, dictatorship, although, not, really, comparable, in, harshness, or, corruption, to, the, type, of, military, dictatorship, that, have, often, bedeviled, the, rest, of, latin, america, by, relinquishing, power, to, a, democratically, elected, successor, ib, ez, del, campo, retained, the, respect, of, a, large, enough, segment, of, the, population, to, remain, a, viable, politician, for, more, than, thirty, years, in, spite, of, the, vague, and, shifting, nature, of, his, ideology, when, constitutional, rule, was, restored, in, 1932, a, strong, middle, class, party, the, radicals, emerged, it, became, the, key, force, in, coalition, governments, for, the, next, 20, years, during, the, period, of, radical, party, dominance, 1932, 52, the, state, increased, its, role, in, the, economy, in, 1952, voters, returned, ib, ez, del, campo, to, office, for, another, six, years, jorge, alessandri, succeeded, ib, ez, del, campo, in, 1958, bringing, chilean, conservatism, back, into, power, democratically, for, another, term, the, 1964, presidential, election, of, christian, democrat, eduardo, frei, montalva, by, an, absolute, majority, initiated, a, period, of, major, reform, under, the, slogan, revolution, in, liberty, the, frei, administration, embarked, on, far, reaching, social, and, economic, programs, particularly, in, education, housing, and, agrarian, reform, including, rural, unionization, of, agricultural, workers, by, 1967, however, frei, encountered, increasing, opposition, from, leftists, who, charged, that, his, reforms, were, inadequate, and, from, conservatives, who, found, them, excessive, at, the, end, of, his, term, frei, had, not, fully, achieved, his, party, s, ambitious, goals, in, the, 1970, election, senator, salvador, allende, of, the, socialist, party, of, chile, then, part, of, the, popular, unity, coalition, which, included, the, communists, radicals, social, democrats, dissident, christian, democrats, the, popular, unitary,

christian, democrat, party, and, jorge, alessandri, for, the, conservative, party, allende, was, not, elected, with, an, absolute, majority, receiving, fewer, than, 35, of, the, votes, the, chilean, congress, conducted, a, runoff, vote, between, the, leading, candidates, allende, and, former, president, jorge, alessandri, and, keeping, with, tradition, chose, allende, by, a, vote, of, 153, to, 35, frei, refused, to, form, an, alliance, with, alessandri, to, oppose, allende, on, the, grounds, that, the, christian, democrats, were, a, workers, party, and, could, not, make, common, cause, with, the, right, wing, an, economic, depression, that, began, in, 1972, was, exacerbated, by, capital, flight, plummeting, private, investment, and, withdrawal, of, bank, deposits, in, response, to,
