buddhist, period, has, a, foundational, importance, in, the, history, of, the, maldives, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, culture, of, the, maldives, both, developed, and, flourished, a, culture, that, survives, today, the, maldivian, language, early, maldive, scripts, architecture, ruling, institutions, customs, and, manners, of, the, maldivians, originated, at, the, time, when, the,

of, the, people, of, the, maldives, until, the, 12th, century, the, ancient, maldivian, kings, promoted, buddhism, and, the, first, maldive, writings, and, artistic, achievements, in, the, form, of, highly, developed, sculpture, and, architecture, originate, from, that, period, nearly, all, archaeological, remains, in, the, maldives, are, from, buddhist, stupas, and, monasteries, and, all,

the, main, gate, facing, east, local, historian, hassan, ahmed, maniku, counted, as, many, as, 59, islands, with, buddhist, archaeological, sites, in, a, provisional, list, he, published, in, 1990, the, importance, of, the, arabs, as, traders, in, the, indian, ocean, by, the, 12th, century, may, partly, explain, why, the, last, buddhist, king, of, the, maldives, dhovemi, converted, to, islam, in, the, year, 1153, or, 1193, adopting, the, muslim, title, of, sultan, muhammad, al, adil, he, initiated, a, series, of, six, islamic, dynasties, that, lasted, until, 1932, when, the, sultanate, became, elective, the, formal, title, of, the, sultan, up, to, 1965, was, sultan, of, land, and, sea, lord, of, the, twelve, thousand, islands, and, sultan, of, the, maldives, which, came, with, the, style, highness, a, muslim, from, berbera, in, somalia, abu, al, barakat, yusuf, al, barbari, yusuf, bin, ahmad, al, kawneyn, is, traditionally, cited, for, this, conversion, according, to, the, story, told, to, ibn, battutah, a, mosque, was, built, with, the, inscription, the, sultan, ahmad, shanurazah, accepted, islam, at, the, hand, of, abu, al, barakat, yusuf, al, barbari, some, scholars, have, suggested, the, possibility, of, ibn, battuta, misreading, maldive, texts, and, having, a, bias, towards, the, north, african, maghrebi, narrative, of, this, shaykh, instead, of, the, east, african, origins, account, that, was, known, as, well, at, the, time, even, when, ibn, battuta, visited, the, islands, the, governor, of, the, island, of, utheemu, at, that, time, was, abd, aziz, al, mogadishawi, a, somali, somalis, have, a, legend, which, claims, abu, al, barakat, yusuf, al, barbari, as, a, native, of, barbera, a, significant, trading, port, on, the, northwestern, coast, of, somalia, this, is, also, seen, when, ibn, battuta, visited, mogadishu, he, mentions, that, the, sultan, at, that, time, abu, bakr, ibn, shaikh, omar, was, a, berber, after, his, conversion, of, the, population, of, dogor, now, known, as, aw, barkhadle, a, town, in, somalia, he, is, also, cited, to, have, been, responsible, for, spreading, islam, in, the, maldivian, islands, establishing, the, hukuru, miskiy, and, converting, the, maldivian, population, to, islam, ibn, battuta, states, the, maldivian, king, was, converted, by, abu, al, barakat, yusuf, al, barbari, others, have, it, he, may, have, been, from, the, persian, town, of, tabriz, the, first, reference, to, an, iranian, origin, dates, to, an, 18th, century, persian, text, his, venerated, tomb, now, stands, on, the, grounds, of, medhu, ziyaaraiy, across, the, street, from, the, friday, mosque, or, hukuru, miskiy, in, mal, built, in, 1656, this, is, the, oldest, mosque, in, the, maldives, following, the, islamic, concept, that, before, islam, there, was, the, time, of, jahiliya, ignorance, in, the, history, books, used, by, maldivians, the, introduction, of, islam, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, is, considered, the, cornerstone, of, the, country, s, history, nonetheless, the, cultural, influence, of, buddhism, remains, a, reality, directly, experienced, by, ibn, battuta, during, his, nine, months, there, sometime, between, 1341, and, 1345, serving, as, a, chief, judge, and, marrying, into, the, royal, family, of, omar, i, for, he, became, embroiled, in, local, politics, and, left, when, his, strict, judgments, in, the, laissez, faire, island, kingdom, began, to, chafe, with, its, rulers, in, particular, he, was, angered, at, the, local, women, going, about, with, no, clothing, above, the, waist, a, cultural, epithet, of, the, region, at, the, time, was, seen, as, a, violation, of, middle, eastern, islamic, rules, of, modesty, and, the, locals, taking, no, notice, when, he, complained, compared, to, the, other, areas, of, south, asia, the, conversion, of, the, maldives, to, islam, happened, relatively, late, the, maldives, remained, a, buddhist, kingdom, for, another, 500, years, arabic, became, the, prime, language, of, administration, instead, of, persian, and, urdu, and, the, maliki, school, of, jurisprudence, was, introduced, both, hinting, at, direct, contact, with, the, core, of, the, arab, world, middle, eastern, seafarers, had, just, begun, to, take, over, the, indian, ocean, trade, routes, in, the, 10th, century, and, found, the, maldives, to, be, an, important, link, in, those, routes, as, the, first, landfall, for, traders, from, basra, sailing, to, southeast, asia, trade, involved, mainly, cowrie, shells, widely, used, as, a, form, of, currency, throughout, asia, and, parts, of, the, east, african, coast, and, coir, fibre, the, bengal, sultanate, where, cowrie, shells, were, used, as, legal, tender, was, one, of, the, principal, trading, partners, of, the, maldives, the, bengal, maldives, cowry, shell, trade, was, the, largest, shell, currency, trade, network, in, history, the, other, essential, product, of, the, maldives, was, coir, the, fibre, of, the, dried, coconut, husk, resistant, to, saltwater, it, stitched, together, and, rigged, the, dhows, that, plied, the, indian, ocean, maldivian, coir, was, exported, to, sindh, china,

administered, from, their, main, colony, in, goa, their, attempts, to, forcefully, impose, christianity, with, the, threat, of, death, provoked, a, local, revolt, led, by, muhammad, thakurufaanu, al, a, u, am, his, two, brothers, and, dhuvaafaru, dhandahele, who, fifteen, years, later, drove, the, portuguese, out, of, the, maldives, this, event, is, now, commemorated, as, national, day, which, is, known, as, qaumee, dhuvas, literally, meaning, national, and, day, it, is, celebrated, on, 1st, of, rabi, al, awwal, the, third, month, of, hijri, islamic, calendar, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the,

were, governed, according, to, centuries, old, islamic, customs, the, british, expelled, the, dutch, from, ceylon, in, 1796, and, included, the, maldives, as, a, british, protectorate, the, status, of, the, maldives, as, a, british, protectorate, was, officially, recorded, in, an, 1887, agreement, in, which, the, sultan, muhammad, mueenuddeen, ii, accepted, british, influence, over, maldivian, external, relations, and, defence, while, retaining, home, rule, which, continued, to, be, regulated, by, muslim, traditional, institutions, in, exchange, for, an, annual, tribute, the, status, of, the, islands, was, akin, to, other, british, protectorates, in, the, indian, ocean, region, including, zanzibar, and, the, trucial, states, in, the, british, period, the, sultan, s, powers, were, taken, over, by, the, chief, minister, much, to, the, chagrin, of, the, british, governor, general, who, continued, to, deal, with, the, ineffectual, sultan, consequently, britain, encouraged, the, development, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, the, first, constitution, was, proclaimed, in, 1932, however, the, new, arrangements, favoured, neither, the, sultan, nor, the, chief, minister, but, rather, a, young, crop, of, british, educated, reformists, as, a, result, angry, mobs, were, instigated, against, the, constitution, which, was, publicly, torn, up, the, maldives, remained, a, british, crown, protectorate, until, 1953, when, the, sultanate, was, suspended, and, the, first, republic, was, declared, under, the, short, lived, presidency, of, mohamed, amin, didi, while,

of, women, s, rights, conservatives, in, mal, ousted, his, government, and, during, a, riot, over, food, shortages, didi, was, beaten, by, a, mob, and, died, on, a, nearby, island, beginning, in, the, 1950s, the, political, history, in, the, maldives, was, largely, influenced, by, the, british, military, presence, on, the, islands, in, 1954, the, restoration, of, the, sultanate, perpetuated, the, rule, of, the, past, two, years, later, the, united, kingdom, obtained, permission, to, reestablish, its, wartime, raf, gan, airfield, in, the, southernmost, addu, atoll, employing, hundreds, of, locals, in, 1957, however, the, new, prime, minister, ibrahim, nasir, called, for, a, review, of, the, agreement, nasir, was, challenged, in, 1959, by, a, local, secessionist, movement, in, the, three, southernmost, atolls, that, benefited, economically, from, the, british, presence, on, gan, this, group, cut, ties, with, the, maldives, government, and, formed, an, independent, state, the, united, suvadive, republic, with, abdullah, afeef, as, president, and, hithadhoo, as, its, capital, one, year, later, the, suvadive, republic, was, scrapped, after, nasir, sent, gunboats, from, mal, with, government, police, and, abdullah, afeef, went, into, exile, meanwhile, in, 1960, the, maldives, allowed, the, united, kingdom, to, continue, to, use, both, the, gan, and, the, hithadhoo, facilities, for, thirty, years, with, the, payment, of, 750, 000, from, 1960, to, 1965, for, the, maldives, economic, development, the, base, was, closed, in, 1976, as, part, of, the, larger, british, withdrawal, of, permanently, stationed, forces, east, of, suez, when, the, british, became, increasingly, unable, to, continue, their, colonial, hold, on, asia, and, were, losing, their, colonies, to, the, indigenous, populations, who, wanted, freedom, on, 26, july, 1965, an, agreement, was, signed, on, behalf, of, the, sultan, by, ibrahim, nasir, rannabandeyri, kilegefan, prime, minister, and, on, behalf, of, the, british, government, by, sir, michael, walker, british, ambassador, designate, to, the, maldive, islands, which, formally, ended, the, british, authority, on, the, defence, and, external, affairs, of, the, maldives, the, islands, thus, achieved, independence, with, the, ceremony, taking, place, at, the, british, high, commissioner, s, residence, in, colombo, after, this, the,

danger, of, being, submerged, due, to, rising, sea, levels, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, has, warned, that, at, current, rates, sea, level, rise, would, be, high, enough, to, make, the, maldives, uninhabitable, by, 2100, the, maldives, has, a, tropical, monsoon, climate, am, under, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, which, is, affected, by, the, large, landmass, of, south, asia, to, the, north, because, the, maldives, has, the, lowest, elevation, of, any, country, in, the, world, the, temperature, is, constantly, hot, and, often, humid, the, presence, of, this, landmass, causes, differential, heating, of, land, and, water, these, factors, set, off, a, rush, of, moisture, rich, air, from, the, indian, ocean, over, south, asia, resulting, in, the, southwest, monsoon, two, seasons, dominate, the, maldives, weather, the, dry, season, associated, with, the, winter, northeastern, monsoon, and, the, rainy, season, associated, with, the, southwest, monsoon, which, brings, strong, winds, and, storms, the, shift, from, the, dry, northeast, monsoon, to, the, moist, southwest, monsoon, occurs, during, april, and, may, during, this, period, the, southwest, winds, contribute, to, the, formation, of, the, southwest, monsoon, which, reaches, the, maldives, at, the, beginning, of, june, and, lasts, until, the, end, of, november, however, the, weather, patterns, of, the, maldives, do, not, always, conform, to, the, monsoon, patterns, of, south, asia, the, annual, rainfall, averages, 254, centimetres, 100, in, in, the, north, and, 381, centimetres, 150, in, in, the, south, the, monsoonal, influence, is, greater, in, the, north, of, the, maldives, than, in, the, south, more, influenced, by, the, equatorial, currents, the, average, high,

indian, ocean, nation, of, 1, 196, small, islands, within, the, next, 30, years, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, s, 2007, report, predicted, the, upper, limit, of, the, sea, level, rise, will, be, 59, centimetres, 23, in, by, 2100, which, means, that, most, of, the, republic, s, 200, inhabited, islands, may, need, to, be, abandoned, according, to, researchers, from, the, university, of, southampton, the, maldives, are, the, third, most, endangered, island, nation, due, to, flooding, from, climate, change, as, a, percentage, of, population, in, 2008, nasheed, announced, plans, to, look, into, purchasing, new, land, in, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, because, of, his, concerns, about, global, warming, and, the, possibility, of, much, of, the, islands, being, inundated, with, water, from, rising, sea, levels, the, purchase, of, land, will, be, made, from, a, fund, generated, by, tourism, the, president, explained, his, intentions, we, do, not, want, to, leave, the, maldives, but, we, also, do, not, want, to, be, climate, refugees, living, in, tents, for, decades, at, the, 2009, international, climate, talks, nasheed, stated, that, for, us, swearing, off, fossil, fuels, is, not, only, the, right, thing, to, do, but, it, is, also, in, our, economic, self, interest, pioneering, countries, will, free, themselves, from, the, unpredictable, price, of, foreign, oil, they, will, capitalise, on, the, new, green, economy, of, the, future, and, they, will, enhance, their, moral, standing, giving, them, greater, political, influence, on, the, world, stage, former, president, mohamed, nasheed, said, in, 2012, that, if, carbon, emissions, continue, at, the, rate, they, are, climbing, today, my, country, will, be, under, water, in, seven, years, he, has, called, for, more, climate, change, mitigation, action, while, on, the, american, television, shows, the, daily, show, and, the, late, show, with, david, letterman, and, hosted, the, world, s, first, underwater, cabinet, meeting, in, 2009, to, raise, awareness, of, the, threats, posed, by, climate, change, concerns, over, rising, sea, levels, have, also, been, expressed, by, nasheed, s, predecessor, maumoon, abdul, gayoom, in, 2020, a, three, year, study, at, the, university, of, plymouth, which, looked, at, the, maldives, and, the, marshall, islands, found, that, tides, move, sediment, to, create, a, higher, elevation, a, morphological, response, that, the, researchers, suggested, could, help, low, lying, islands, adjust, to, sea, level, rise, and, keep, the, islands, habitable, the, research, also, reported, that, sea, walls, were, compromising, islands, ability, to, adjust, to, rising, sea, levels, and, that, island, drowning, is, an, inevitable, outcome, for, islands, with, coastal, structures, like, sea, walls, hideki, kanamaru, natural, resources, officer, with, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, in, asia, pacific, said, the, study, provided, a, new, perspective, on, how, island, nations, could, tackle, the, challenge, of, sea, level, rise, and, that, even, if, islands, can, adapt, naturally, to, higher, seas, by, raising, their, own, crests, humans, still, needed, to, double, down, on, global, warming, and, protection, for, island, populations, environmental, issues, other, than, sea, level, rise, include, bad, waste, disposal, and, sand, theft, although, the, maldives, are, kept, relatively, pristine, and, little, litter, can, be, found, on, the, islands, most, waste, disposal, sites, are, often, substandard, the, bulk, of, the, waste, from, mal, and, nearby, resorts, in, the, maldives, are, disposed, of, at, thilafushi, an, industrial, island, on, top, of, a, lagoon, reclaimed, in, the, early, 90s, to, sort,

to, a, single, el, ni, o, phenomenon, event, caused, coral, bleaching, killing, two, thirds, of, the, nation, s, coral, reefs, in, an, effort, to, induce, the, regrowth, of, the, reefs, scientists, placed, electrified, cones, anywhere, from, 20, 60, feet, 6, 1, 18, 3, m, below, the, surface, to, provide, a, substrate, for, larval, coral, attachment, in, 2004, scientists, witnessed, corals, regenerating, corals, began, to, eject, pink, orange, eggs, and, sperm, the, growth, of, these, electrified, corals, was, five, times, faster, than, untreated, corals, scientist, azeez, hakim, stated, before, 1998, we, never, thought, that, this, reef, would, die, we, had, always, taken, for, granted, that, these, animals, would, be, there, that, this, reef, would, be, there, forever, el, ni, o, gave, us, a, wake, up, call, that, these, things, are, not, going, to, be, there, forever, not, only, this, but, they, also, act, as, a, natural, barrier, against, tropical, storms, floods, and, tsunamis, seaweeds, grow, on, the, skeletons, of, dead, coral, again, in, 2016, the, coral, reefs, of, the, maldives, experienced, a, severe, bleaching, incident, up, to, 95, of, coral, around, some,

scientific, studies, suggest, that, the, fauna, varies, greatly, between, atolls, following, a, north, south, gradient, but, important, differences, between, neighbouring, atolls, were, also, found, especially, in, terms, of, sea, animals, which, may, be, linked, to, differences, in, fishing, pressure, including, poaching, the, terrestrial, habitats, of, the, maldives, are, confronted, with, a,
