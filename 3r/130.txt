uttar, pradesh, kairana, and, baghpat, delhi, new, delhi, the, yamuna, pronounced, iast, yamun, is, the, second, largest, tributary, river, of, the, ganges, by, discharge, and, the, longest, tributary, in, india, originating, from, the, yamunotri, glacier, at, a, height, of, about, 4, 500, m, 14, 800, ft, on, the, southwestern, slopes, of, bandarpunch, peaks, of, the, lower, himalaya, in, uttarakhand, it, travels, 1, 376, kilometres, 855, mi, and, has, a, drainage, system, of, 366, 223, square, kilometres, 141, 399, sq, mi, 40, 2, of, the, entire, ganges, basin, it, merges, with, the, ganges, at, triveni, sangam, allahabad, which, is, a, site, of, the, kumbh, mela, a, hindu, festival, held, every, 12, years, like, the, ganges, the, yamuna, is, highly, venerated, in, hinduism, and, worshipped, as, the, goddess, yamuna, in, hinduism, she, is, believed, to, be, the, daughter, of, the, sun, god, surya, and, the, sister, of, yama, the, god, of, death, and, so, she, is, also, known, as, yami, according, to, popular, hindu, legends, bathing, in, yamuna, s, sacred, waters, frees, one, from, the, torments, of, death, the, river, crosses, several, states, such, as, haryana, uttar, pradesh, uttarakhand, and, delhi, it, also, meets, several, tributaries, along, the, way, including, tons, chambal, its, longest, tributary, which, has, its, own, large, basin, followed, by, sindh, the, betwa, and, ken, from, uttarakhand, the, river, flows, into, the, state, of, himachal, pradesh, after, passing, paonta, sahib, yamuna, flows, along, the, boundary, of, haryana, and, uttar, pradesh, and, after, exiting, haryana, it, continues, to, flow, till, it, merges, with, the, river, ganges, at, sangam, or, prayag, in, prayagraj, uttar, pradesh, it, helps, create, the, highly, fertile, alluvial, ganges, yamuna, doab, region, between, itself, and, the, ganges, in, the, indo, gangetic, plain, nearly, 57, million, people, depend, on, the, yamuna, s, waters, and, the, river, accounts, for, more, than, 70, percent, of, delhi, s, water, supply, it, has, an, annual, flow, of, 97, billion, cubic, metres, and, nearly, 4, billion, cubic, metres, are, consumed, every, year, of, which, irrigation, constitutes, 96, at, the, hathni, kund, barrage, its, waters, are, diverted, into, two, large, canals, the, western, yamuna, canal, flowing, towards, haryana, and, the, eastern, yamuna, canal, towards, uttar, pradesh, beyond, that, point, the, yamuna, is, joined, by, the, somb, a, seasonal, rivulet, from, haryana, and, by, the, highly, polluted, hindon, river, near, noida, by, najafgarh, drain, near, wazirabad, and, by, various, other, drains, so, that, it, continues, only, as, a, trickling, sewage, bearing, drain, before, joining, the, chambal, at, pachnada, in, the, etawah, district, of, uttar, pradesh, the, water, quality, in, upper, yamuna, as, the, 375, kilometre, 233, mi, long, stretch, of, yamuna, is, called, from, its, origin, at, yamunotri, to, okhla, barrage, is, of, reasonably, good, quality, until, the, wazirabad, barrage, in, delhi, below, this, the, discharge, of, wastewater, in, delhi, through, 15, drains, between, wazirabad, barrage, and, okhla, barrage, renders, the, river, severely, polluted, wazirabad, barrage, to, okhla, barrage, 22, km, 14, mi, stretch, of, yamuna, in, delhi, is, less, than, 2, of, yamuna, s, total, length, but, accounts, for, nearly, 80, of, the, total, pollution, in, the, river, untreated, wastewater, and, poor, quality, of, water, discharged, from, the, wastewater, treatment, plants, are, the, major, reasons, of, yamuna, s, pollution, in, delhi, to, address, river, pollution, measures, have, been, taken, by, the, ministry, of, environment, and, forests, moef, under, the, yamuna, action, plan, yap, which, has, been, implemented, since, 1993, by, the, moef, s, national, river, conservation, directorate, nrcd, the, present, sarsuti, river, which, originates, in, the, shivalik, hills, in, himachal, and, haryana, border, and, merges, with, ghaggar, river, near, pehowa, is, the, palaeochannel, of, yamuna, yamuna, changed, its, course, to, the, east, due, to, a, shift, in, the, slope, of, the, earth, s, crust, caused, by, plate, tectonics, the, source, of, yamuna, lies, in, the, yamunotri, glacier, at, an, elevation, of, 6, 387, metres, 20, 955, ft, on, the, southwestern, slopes, of, banderpooch, peaks, which, lie, in, the, mussoorie, range, of, the, lower, himalayas, north, of, haridwar, in, uttarkashi, district, uttarakhand, yamunotri, temple, a, shrine, dedicated, to, the, goddess, yamuna, is, one, of, the, holiest, shrines, in, hinduism, and, part, of, the, chota, char, dham, yatra, circuit, also, standing, close, to, the, temple, on, its, 13, kilometre, 8, mi, trek, route, that, follows, the, right, bank, of, the, river, lies, markendeya, tirtha, where, the, sage, markandeya, wrote, the, markandeya, purana, the, river, flows, southwards, for, about, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, through, the, lower, himalayas, and, the, shivalik, hills, range, morainic, deposits, are, found, along, the, steep, upper, yamuna, highlighted, with, geomorphic, features, such, as, interlocking, spurs, steep, rock, benches, gorges, and, stream, terraces, large, terraces, formed, over, a, long, period, of, time, can, be, seen, in, the, lower, course, of, the, river, such, as, those, near, naugoan, an, important, part, of, its, early, catchment, area, totalling, 2, 320, square, kilometres, 900, sq, mi, lies, in, himachal, pradesh, the, tons, yamuna, s, largest, tributary, drains, a, large, portion, of, the, upper, catchment, area, and, holds, more, water, than, the, main, stream, it, rises, from, the, hari, ki, dun, valley, and, merges, after, kalsi, near, dehradun, the, drainage, system, of, the, river, stretches, between, giri, sutlej, catchment, in, himachal, and, yamuna, bhilangna, catchment, in, garhwal, also, draining, the, ridge, of, shimla, kalanag, 6, 387, metres, is, the, highest, point, of, the, yamuna, basin, other, tributaries, in, the, region, are, the, giri, rishi, ganga, kunta, hanuman, ganga, and, bata, which, drain, the, upper, catchment, area, of, the, yamuna, basin, from, the, upper, catchment, area, the, river, descends, onto, the, plains, of, doon, valley, at, dak, pathar, near, dehradun, flowing, through, the, dakpathar, barrage, the, water, is, diverted, into, a, canal, for, power, generation, further, downstream, the, assan, river, joins, the, yamuna, at, the, asan, barrage, which, hosts, a, bird, sanctuary, after, passing, the, sikh, pilgrimage, town, of, paonta, sahib, the, yamuna, reaches, tajewala, in, yamuna, nagar, district, named, after, the, river, of, haryana, a, dam, built, here, in, 1873, is, the, origin, of, two, important, canals, the, western, and, eastern, yamuna, canals, which, irrigate, the, states, of, haryana, and, uttar, pradesh, the, western, yamuna, canal, wyc, crosses, yamuna, nagar, karnal, panipat, and, sonipat, before, reaching, the, haiderpur, treatment, plant, which, contributes, to, delhi, s, municipal, water, supply, the, yamuna, receives, wastewater, from, yamuna, nagar, and, panipat, cities, beyond, this, it, is, replenished, by, seasonal, streams, and, groundwater, accrual, during, the, dry, season, the, yamuna, remains, dry, in, many, stretches, between, the, tajewala, dam, and, delhi, where, it, enters, near, the, palla, barrage, after, traversing, 224, kilometres, 139, mi, the, yamuna, defines, the, state, borders, between, himachal, pradesh, and, uttarakhand, and, between, haryana, delhi, and, uttar, pradesh, when, the, yamuna, reaches, the, indo, gangetic, plain, it, runs, almost, parallel, to, the, ganges, the, two, rivers, creating, the, ganges, yamuna, doab, region, spread, across, 69, 000, square, kilometres, 27, 000, sq, mi, one, third, of, the, alluvial, plain, the, region, is, known, for, its, agricultural, output, particularly, for, the, cultivation, of, basmati, rice, the, plain, s, agriculture, supports, one, third, of, india, s, population, subsequently, the, yamuna, flows, through, the, states, of, delhi, haryana, and, uttar, pradesh, before, merging, with, the, ganges, at, a, sacred, spot, known, as, triveni, sangam, in, prayagraj, pilgrims, travel, by, boats, to, platforms, erected, in, midstream, to, offer, prayers, during, the, kumbh, mela, held, every, 12, years, large, congregations, of, people, immerse, themselves, in, the, sacred, waters, of, the, confluence, the, cities, of, baghpat, delhi, noida, mathura, agra, firozabad, etawah, kalpi, hamirpur, and, prayagraj, lie, on, its, banks, at, etawah, it, meets, it, another, important, tributary, chambal, followed, by, a, host, of, tributaries, further, down, including, sindh, the, betwa, and, ken, yamuna, s, tributaries, make, up, 70, 9, of, the, catchment, area, and, the, river, has, six, important, tributaries, the, name, yamuna, seems, to, be, derived, from, the, sanskrit, word, yama, meaning, twin, and, it, may, have, been, applied, to, the, river, because, it, runs, parallel, to, the, ganges, the, earliest, mention, of, yamuna, is, found, at, many, places, in, the, rig, veda, c, 1500, 1000, bce, which, was, composed, during, the, vedic, period, c, 1700, 1100, bce, and, also, in, the, later, atharvaveda, and, the, brahmanas, including, aitareya, brahmana, and, shatapatha, brahmana, in, the, rigveda, the, story, of, the, yamuna, describes, her, excessive, love, for, her, twin, yama, who, in, turn, asks, her, to, find, a, suitable, match, for, herself, which, she, does, in, krishna, yamuna, is, mentioned, as, iomanes, ioames, in, the, surveys, of, seleucus, i, nicator, an, officer, of, alexander, the, great, and, one, of, the, diadochi, who, visited, india, in, 305, bce, greek, traveller, and, geographer, megasthenes, visited, india, sometime, before, 288, bce, the, date, of, chandragupta, s, death, and, mentioned, the, river, in, his, indica, where, he, described, the, region, around, it, as, the, land, of, surasena, in, mahabharata, the, pandava, capital, of, indraprastha, was, situated, on, the, banks, of, yamuna, considered, to, be, the, site, of, modern, delhi, geological, evidence, indicates, that, in, the, distant, past, the, yamuna, was, a, tributary, of, the, ghaggar, river, identified, by, some, as, the, vedic, sarasvati, river, it, later, changed, its, course, eastward, becoming, a, tributary, of, the, ganges, while, some, have, argued, that, this, was, due, to, a, tectonic, event, and, may, have, led, to, the, sarasvati, river, drying, up, the, end, of, many, harappan, civilisation, settlements, and, creation, of, the, thar, desert, recent, geological, research, suggests, that, the, diversion, of, the, yamuna, to, the, ganges, may, have, occurred, during, the, pleistocene, and, thus, could, not, be, connected, to, the, decline, of, the, harappan, civilisation, in, the, region, most, of, the, great, empires, which, ruled, over, a, majority, of, india, were, based, in, the, highly, fertile, ganges, yamuna, basin, including, the, magadha, c, 600, bce, maurya, empire, 321, 185, bce, shunga, empire, 185, 73, bce, kushan, empire, 1st, 3rd, centuries, ce, and, gupta, empire, 280, 550, ce, and, many, had, their, capitals, here, in, cities, like, pataliputra, or, mathura, these, rivers, were, revered, throughout, these, kingdoms, that, flourished, on, their, banks, since, the, period, of, chandragupta, ii, r, 375, 415, ce, statues, both, the, ganges, and, yamuna, became, common, throughout, the, gupta, empire, further, to, the, south, images, of, the, ganges, and, yamuna, are, found, amidst, shrines, of, the, chalukyas, rashtrakutas, 753, 982, and, on, their, royal, seals, prior, to, them, the, chola, empire, also, added, the, river, into, their, architectural, motifs, the, three, river, goddess, shrine, next, to, the, kailash, rock, cut, temple, at, ellora, shows, the, ganges, flanked, by, the, yamuna, and, saraswati, the, stretch, of, the, river, from, its, origin, at, yamunotri, to, okhla, barrage, in, delhi, is, called, upper, yamuna, a, memorandum, of, understanding, mou, was, signed, amongst, the, five, basin, states, himachal, pradesh, uttar, pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, and, delhi, on, 12, may, 1994, for, sharing, of, its, waters, this, led, to, the, formation, of, the, upper, yamuna, river, board, under, india, s, ministry, of, water, resources, whose, primary, functions, are, regulation, of, the, available, flows, amongst, the, beneficiary, states, and, monitoring, the, return, flows, monitoring, conservation, and, upgrading, the, quality, of, surface, and, groundwater, maintaining, hydro, meteorological, data, for, the, basin, overviewing, plans, for, watershed, management, and, monitoring, and, reviewing, the, progress, of, all, projects, up, to, and, including, okhla, barrage, flood, forecasting, systems, are, established, at, poanta, sahib, where, tons, pawar, and, giri, tributaries, meet, the, river, take, 60, hours, to, travel, from, tajewala, to, delhi, thus, allowing, a, two, day, advance, flood, warning, period, the, central, water, commission, started, flood, forecasting, services, in, 1958, with, its, first, forecasting, station, on, yamuna, at, delhi, railway, bridge, yamuna, has, the, following, six, functional, barrages, eight, including, old, replaced, barrages, nine, including, a, new, proposed, barrage, from, north, west, to, southeast, use, of, the, yamuna, s, waters, for, irrigation, in, the, indo, gangetic, plains, is, enhanced, by, its, many, canals, some, dating, to, the, 14th, century, tughlaq, dynasty, which, built, the, nahr, i, bahisht, paradise, parallel, to, the, river, the, nahr, i, bahisht, was, restored, and, extended, by, the, mughals, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, by, engineer, ali, mardan, khan, starting, from, benawas, where, the, river, enters, the, plains, and, terminating, near, the, mughal, capital, of, shahjahanabad, the, present, city, of, delhi, as, the, yamuna, enters, the, northern, plains, near, dakpathar, at, an,

western, yamuna, canal, wyc, was, built, in, 1335, ce, by, firuz, shah, tughlaq, excessive, silting, caused, it, to, stop, flowing, c, 1750, when, the, british, raj, undertook, a, three, year, renovation, in, 1817, by, bengal, engineer, group, the, tajewala, barrage, dam, was, built, in, 1832, 33, to, regulate, the, flow, of, water, and, was, replaced, by, the, modern, hathni, kund, barrage, in, 1999, the, main, canal, is, 86, kilometres, 53, mi, long, when, including, its, branches, and, many, major, and, minor, irrigation, channels, it, has, a, total, length, of, 325, km, 202, mi, the, wyc, begins, at, the, hathni, kund, barrage, about, 38, km, 24, mi, from, dakpathar, and, south, of, doon, valley, the, canals, irrigate, vast, tracts, of, land, in, the, region, in, ambala, karnal, sonipat, rohtak, jind, hisar, and, bhiwani, districts, the, major, branch, canals, are, a, proposed, heavy, freight, canal, the, sutlej, yamuna, link, syl, is, being, built, westwards, from, near, yamuna, s, headwaters, through, the, punjab, region, near, an, ancient, caravan, route, and, highlands, pass, to, the, navigable, parts, of, the, sutlej, indus, watershed, this, will, connect, the, ganges, which, flows, to, the, east, coast, of, the, subcontinent, with, points, west, via, pakistan, when, completed, the, syl, will, allow, shipping, from, india, s, east, coast, to, the, west,

of, its, sections, are, being, developed, for, navigation, like, the, ganges, the, yamuna, river, is, highly, venerated, in, hinduism, in, the, form, of, a, river, and, as, the, goddess, yamuna, the, yamuna, is, considered, a, river, of, heaven, the, rig, veda, includes, the, yamuna, river, as, one, of, the, seven, sacred, rivers, along, with, the, ganges, according, to, hindu, mythology, the, river, was, brought, to, earth, by, the, ascetic, practice, of, the, seven, sages, where, she, first, descended, on, mount, kalinda, therefore, yamuna, is, also, known, as, kalindi, the, padma, purana, describes, yamuna, s, purifying, properties, and, states, that, her, waters, cleanse, the, mind, from, sin, it, also, mentions, that, bathing, in, her, sacred, waters, frees, one, from, the, torments, of, death, art, from, the, gupta, period, depict, yamuna, and, ganga, on, the, entrances, and, doorjambs, of, temples, and, sacred, places, upon, passing, through, these, doors, visitors, were, symbolically, purified, by, these, rivers, some, religious, figures, notably, pilgrim, priests, of, mathura, and, vrindavan, do, not, regard, the, physical, pollution, of, the, yamuna, to, have, any, effect, on, the, river, s, spiritual, purity, the, braj, region, is, where, the, worship, of, the, yamuna, and, its, pollution, is, most, pronounced, however, more, and, more, hindus, no, longer, ritually, bathe, in, the, yamuna, drink, its, water, or, use, its, water, for, worship, in, vrindavan, s, holy, shrines, bottled, water, is, used, instead, in, her, human, form, yamuna, is, the, daughter, of, surya, the, sun, god, and, his, wife, saranyu, she, is, the, twin, sister, of, yama, the, god, of, death, and, is, also, known, as, yami, the, agni, purana, describes, yamuna, as, having, a, dark, complexion, mounted, on, a, turtle, and, holding, a, pot, in, her, hand, yamuna, as, a, river, and, goddess, has, a, close, association, with, krishna, the, puranas, narrate, many, stories, about, krishna, in, relation, to, the, river, and, its, surroundings, one, such, story, is, of, kaliya, daman, the, subduing, of, kaliya, a, n, ga, which, had, inhabited, the, river, and, terrorised, the, people, of, braja, due, to, krishna, s, connection, with, the, river, and, the, braja, region, the, yamuna, river, is, a, center, of, pilgrimage, for, his, devotees, in, the, pushti, marga, founded, by, vallabhacharya, and, in, which, krishna, is, the, main, deity, yamuna, is, worshipped, as, a, goddess, the, yamunashtakam, is, a, 16th, century, sanskrit, hymn, composed, by, vallabhacharya, which, describes, the, story, of, yamuna, s, descent, to, meet, her, beloved, krishna, and, to, purify, the, world, the, hymn, also, praises, her, for, being, the, source, of, all, spiritual, abilities, and, while, the, ganges, is, considered, an, epitome, of, asceticism, and, higher, knowledge, and, can, grant, moksha, or, liberation, it, is, yamuna, who, being, a, holder, of, infinite, love, and, compassion, can, grant, freedom, even, from, death, the, realm, of, her, elder, brother, vallabhacharya, writes, that, she, rushes, down, the, kalinda, mountain, and, describes, her, as, the, daughter, of, kalinda, giving, her, the, name, kalindi, the, backdrop, of, krishna, leela, the, text, also, talks, about, her, water, being, the, colour, of, lord, krishna, which, is, dark, shyam, the, river, is, referred, to, as, asita, in, some, historical, texts, numerous, hindu, texts, have, shlokas, hymns, on, yamuna, as, follows, the, yamuna, from, the, source, to, its, culmination, in, ganges, is, a, habitat, for, fish, for, approximately, 1, 400, km, 870, mi, stretch, and, supports, a, rich, diversity, of, species, fish, from, the, family, cyprinidae, dominate, the, variety, of, fish, species, found, in, the, river, this, includes, indian, carp, and, also, invasive, species, from, the, family, in, a, study, 93, species, of, fish, were, found, in, the, river, including, catfish, species, of, non, native, tilapia, have, become, established, in, the, river, they, have, been, implicated, in, the, decline, of, the, ghariyal, indian, crocodile, population, in, the, river, large, turtles, used, to, be, a, common, sight, on, the, river, a, few, decades, ago, but, they, have, mostly, disappeared, in, 1909, the, waters, of, the, yamuna, were, distinguishable, as, clear, blue, when, compared, to, the, silt, laden, yellow, of, the, ganges, however, due, to, high, density, population, growth, and, fast, industrialisation, yamuna, has, become, one, of, the, most, polluted, rivers, in, the, world, the, yamuna, is, particularly, polluted, downstream, of, new, delhi, the, capital, of, india, which, dumps, about, 58, of, its, waste, into, the, river, a, 2016, study, shows, that, there, is, 100, urban, metabolism, of, river, yamuna, as, it, passes, through, the, national, capital, territory, nct, of, delhi, the, most, pollution, comes, from, wazirabad, from, where, yamuna, enters, delhi, the, wazirabad, barrage, to, the, new, okhla, barrage, segment, 22, km, stretch, of, yamuna, in, delhi, is, less, than, 2, of, yamuna, s, total, length, but, accounts, for, nearly, 80, of, the, total, pollution, in, the, river, 22, out, of, 35, sewage, treatment, plants, in, delhi, do, not, meet, the, wastewater, standards, prescribed, by, the, delhi, pollution, control, committee, dpcc, thus, untreated, wastewater, and, poor, quality, of, water, discharged, from, the, wastewater, treatment, plants, are, the, major, reasons, as, of, 2019, the, river, receives, 800, million, litres, of, largely, untreated, sewage, and, additional, 44, million, litres, of, industrial, effluents, each, day, of, which, only, 35, percent, of, the, sewage, released, into, the, river, are, believed, to, be, treated, in, 1994, the, states, of, uttarakhand, himachal, pradesh, uttar, pradesh, haryana, rajasthan, and, delhi, made, a, water, sharing, agreement, that, is, due, for, revision, in, 2025, to, achieve, a, water, quality, suitable, for, bathing, bod, 3, mg, l, and, do, 5, mg, l, would, require, a, greater, rate, of, water, flow, in, the, river, a, study, has, recommended, that, 23, cubic, metres, 23, 000, l, 5, 100, imp, gal, per, second, of, water, should, be, released, from, hathni, kund, barrage, during, the, lean, season, to, provide, a, minimum, environmental, flow, in, the, yamuna, the, last, barrage, across, the, yamuna, river, is, the, mathura, barrage, at, gokul, to, supply, its, drinking, water, downstream, of, this,
