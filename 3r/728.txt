nordic, territories, that, are, not, part, of, scandinavia, chronological, history, scandinavia, is, a, subregion, of, northern, europe, with, strong, historical, cultural, and, linguistic, ties, between, its, constituent, peoples, scandinavia, most, commonly, refers, to, denmark, norway, and, sweden, it, can, sometimes, also, refer, to, the, scandinavian, peninsula, which, excludes, denmark, but, includes, a, part, of, northern, finland, in, english, usage, scandinavia, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, nordic, countries, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, are, sometimes, included, in, scandinavia, for, their, ethnolinguistic, relations, with, sweden, norway, and, denmark, while, finland, differs, from, other, nordic, countries, in, this, respect, some, authors, call, it, scandinavian, due, to, its, economic, and, cultural, similarities, the, geography, of, the, region, is, varied, from, the, norwegian, fjords, in, the, west, and, scandinavian, mountains, covering, parts, of, norway, and, sweden, to, the, low, and, flat, areas, of, denmark, in, the, south, as, well, as, archipelagos, and, lakes, in, the, east, most, of, the, population, in, the, region, live, in, the, more, temperate, southern, regions, with, the, northern, parts, having, long, cold, winters, the, region, became, notable, during, the, viking, age, when, scandinavian, peoples, participated, in, large, scale, raiding, conquest, colonization, and, trading, mostly, throughout, europe, they, also, used, their, longships, for, exploration, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, reach, north, america, these, exploits, saw, the, establishment, of, the, north, sea, empire, which, comprised, large, parts, of, scandinavia, and, great, britain, though, it, was, relatively, short, lived, scandinavia, was, eventually, christianized, and, the, coming, centuries, saw, various, unions, of, scandinavian, nations, most, notably, the, kalmar, union, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, which, lasted, for, over, 100, years, until, the, swedish, king, gustav, i, led, sweden, to, independence, it, also, saw, numerous, wars, between, the, nations, which, shaped, the, modern, borders, the, most, recent, union, was, the, union, between, sweden, and, norway, which, ended, in, 1905, in, modern, times, the, region, has, prospered, with, the, economies, of, the, countries, being, amongst, the, strongest, in, europe, sweden, denmark, norway, iceland, and, finland, all, maintain, welfare, systems, considered, to, be, generous, with, the, economic, and, social, policies, of, the, countries, being, dubbed, the, nordic, model, the, geography, of, scandinavia, is, extremely, varied, notable, are, the, norwegian, fjords, the, scandinavian, mountains, covering, much, of, norway, and, parts, of, sweden, the, flat, low, areas, in, denmark, and, the, archipelagos, of, finland, norway, and, sweden, finland, and, sweden, have, many, lakes, and, moraines, legacies, of, the, ice, age, which, ended, about, ten, millennia, ago, the, southern, regions, of, scandinavia, which, are, also, the, most, populous, regions, have, a, temperate, climate, scandinavia, extends, north, of, the, arctic, circle, but, has, relatively, mild, weather, for, its, latitude, due, to, the, gulf, stream, many, of, the, scandinavian, mountains, have, an, alpine, tundra, climate, the, climate, varies, from, north, to, south, and, from, west, to, east, a, marine, west, coast, climate, cfb, typical, of, western, europe, dominates, in, denmark, the, southernmost, part, of, sweden, and, along, the, west, coast, of, norway, reaching, north, to, 65, n, with, orographic, lift, giving, more, mm, year, precipitation, 5000, mm, in, some, areas, in, western, norway, the, central, part, from, oslo, to, stockholm, has, a, humid, continental, climate, dfb, which, gradually, gives, way, to, subarctic, climate, dfc, further, north, and, cool, marine, west, coast, climate, cfc, along, the, northwestern, coast, a, small, area, along, the, northern, coast, east, of, the, north, cape, has, tundra, climate, et, as, a, result, of, a, lack, of, summer, warmth, the, scandinavian, mountains, block, the, mild, and, moist, air, coming, from, the, southwest, thus, northern, sweden, and, the, finnmarksvidda, plateau, in, norway, receive, little, precipitation, and, have, cold, winters, large,

appears, later, in, old, english, as, scedenig, and, in, old, norse, as, sk, ney, the, earliest, identified, source, for, the, name, scandinavia, is, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, dated, to, the, 1st, century, ad, various, references, to, the, region, can, also, be, found, in, pytheas, pomponius, mela, tacitus, ptolemy, procopius, and, jordanes, usually, in, the, form, of, scandza, it, is, believed, that, the, name, used, by, pliny, may, be, of, west, germanic, origin, originally, denoting, scania, according, to, some, scholars, the, germanic, stem, can, be, reconstructed, as, ska, an, meaning, danger, or, damage, the, second, segment, of, the, name, has, been, reconstructed, as, awj, meaning, land, on, the, water, or, island, the, name, scandinavia, would, then, mean, dangerous, island, which, is, considered, to, refer, to, the, treacherous, sandbanks, surrounding, scania, skan, r, in, scania, with, its, long, falsterbo, reef, has, the, same, stem, skan, combined, with, r, which, means, sandbanks, alternatively, sca, n, dinavia, and, sk, ney, along, with, the, old, norse, goddess, name, ska, i, may, be, related, to, proto, germanic, ska, wa, meaning, shadow, john, mckinnell, comments, that, this, etymology, suggests, that, the, goddess, ska, i, may, have, once, been, a, personification, of, the, geographical, region, of, scandinavia, or, associated, with, the, underworld, another, possibility, is, that, all, or, part, of, the, segments, of, the, name, came, from, the, pre, germanic, mesolithic, people, inhabiting, the, region, in, modernity, scandinavia, is, a, peninsula, but, between, approximately, 10, 300, and, 9, 500, years, ago, the, southern, part, of, scandinavia, was, an, island, separated, from, the, northern, peninsula, with, water, exiting, the, baltic, sea, through, the, area, where, stockholm, is, now, located, the, latin, names, in, pliny, s, text, gave, rise, to, different, forms, in, medieval, germanic, texts, in, jordanes, history, of, the, goths, ad, 551, the, form, scandza, is, the, name, used, for, their, original, home, separated, by, sea, from, the, land, of, europe, chapter, 1, 4, where, jordanes, meant, to, locate, this, quasi, legendary, island, is, still, a, hotly, debated, issue, both, in, scholarly, discussions, and, in, the, nationalistic, discourse, of, various, european, countries, the, form, scadinavia, as, the, original, home, of, the, langobards, appears, in, paul, the, deacon, historia, langobardorum, but, in, other, versions, of, historia, langobardorum, appear, the, forms, scadan, scandanan, scadanan, and, scatenauge, frankish, sources, used, sconaowe, and, aethelweard, an, anglo, saxon, historian, used, scani, in, beowulf, the, forms, scedenige, and, scedeland, are, used, while, the, alfredian, translation, of, orosius, and, wulfstan, s, travel, accounts, used, the, old, english, sconeg, the, earliest, s, mi, joik, texts, written, down, refer, to, the, world, as,

woman, the, name, for, ska, i, s, father, jazi, is, known, in, s, mi, as, hci, the, waterman, and, her, son, with, odin, s, mingr, can, be, interpreted, as, a, descendant, of, saam, the, s, mi, population, older, joik, texts, give, evidence, of, the, old, s, mi, belief, about, living, on, an, island, and, state, that, the, wolf, is, known, as, suolu, gievra, meaning, the, strong, one, on, the, island, the, s, mi, place, name, sulliid, ielbma, means, the, island, s, threshold, and, suolo, ielgi, means, the, island, s, back, in, recent, substrate, studies, s, mi, linguists, have, examined, the, initial, cluster, sk, in, words, used, in, the, s, mi, languages, and, concluded, that, sk, is, a, phonotactic, structure, of, alien, origin, although, the, term, scandinavia, used, by, pliny, the, elder, probably, originated, in, the, ancient, germanic, languages, the, modern, form, scandinavia, does, not, descend, directly, from, the, ancient, germanic, term, rather, the, word, was, brought, into, use, in, europe, by, scholars, borrowing, the, term, from, ancient, sources, like, pliny, and, was, used, vaguely, for, scania, and, the, southern, region, of, the, peninsula, the, term, was, popularised, by, the, linguistic, and, cultural, scandinavist, movement, which, asserted, the, common, heritage, and, cultural, unity, of, the, scandinavian, countries, and, rose, to, prominence, in, the, 1830s, the, popular, usage, of, the, term, in, sweden, denmark, and, norway, as, a, unifying, concept, became, established, in, the, 19th, century, through, poems, such, as, hans, christian, andersen, s, i, am, a, scandinavian, of, 1839, after, a, visit, to, sweden, andersen, became, a, supporter, of, early, political, scandinavism, in, a, letter, describing, the, poem, to, a, friend, he, wrote, all, at, once, i, understood, how, related, the, swedes, the, danes, and, the, norwegians, are, and, with, this, feeling, i, wrote, the, poem, immediately, after, my, return, we, are, one, people, we, are, called, scandinavians, the, influence, of, scandinavism, as, a, scandinavist, political, movement, peaked, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, between, the, first, schleswig, war, 1848, 1850, and, the, second, schleswig, war, 1864, the, swedish, king, also, proposed, a, unification, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, into, a, single, united, kingdom, the, background, for, the, proposal, was, the, tumultuous, events, during, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, beginning, of, the, century, this, war, resulted, in, finland, formerly, the, eastern, third, of, sweden, becoming, the, russian, grand, duchy, of, finland, in, 1809, and, norway, de, jure, in, union, with, denmark, since, 1387, although, de, facto, treated, as, a, province, becoming, independent, in, 1814, but, thereafter, swiftly, forced, to, accept, a, personal, union, with, sweden, the, dependent, territories, iceland, the, faroe, islands, and, greenland, historically, part, of, norway, remained, with, denmark, in, accordance, with, the, treaty, of, kiel, sweden, and, norway, were, thus, united, under, the, swedish, monarch, but, finland, s, inclusion, in, the, russian, empire, excluded, any, possibility, for, a, political, union, between, finland, and, any, of, the, other, nordic, countries, the, end, of, the, scandinavian, political, movement, came, when, denmark, was, denied, the, military, support, promised, from, sweden, and, norway, to, annex, the, danish, duchy, of, schleswig, which, together, with, the, german, duchy, of, holstein, had, been, in, personal, union, with, denmark, the, second, war, of, schleswig, followed, in, 1864, a, brief, but, disastrous, war, between, denmark, and, prussia, supported, by, austria, schleswig, holstein, was, conquered, by, prussia, and, after, prussia, s, success, in, the, franco, prussian, war, a, prussian, led, german, empire, was, created, and, a, new, power, balance, in, the, baltic, region, was, established, the, scandinavian, monetary, union, established, in, 1873, lasted, until, world, war, i, the, term, scandinavia, sometimes, specified, in, english, as, continental, scandinavia, or, mainland, scandinavia, is, ordinarily, used, locally, for, denmark, norway, and, sweden, as, a, subset, of, the, nordic, countries, known, in, norwegian, danish, and, swedish, as, norden, finnish, pohjoismaat, icelandic, nor, url, ndin, faroese, nor, urlond, however, in, english, usage, the, term, scandinavia, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, or, near, synonym, for, what, are, known, locally, as, nordic, countries, usage, in, english, is, different, from, usage, in, the, scandinavian, languages, themselves, which, use, scandinavia, in, the, narrow, meaning, and, by, the, fact, that, the, question, of, whether, a, country, belongs, to, scandinavia, is, politicised, people, from, the, nordic, world, beyond, norway, denmark, and, sweden, may, be, offended, at, being, either, included, in, or, excluded, from, the, category, of, scandinavia, nordic, countries, is, used, unambiguously, for, denmark, norway, sweden, finland, and, iceland, including, their, associated, territories, greenland, the, faroe, islands, and, the, land, islands, the, geological, term, fennoscandia, sometimes, fennoscandinavia, refers, to, the, fennoscandian, shield, or, baltic, shield, which, includes, the, scandinavian, peninsula, finland, and, karelia, and, excludes, denmark, and, other, parts, of, the, wider, nordic, world, the, terms, fennoscandia, and, fennoscandinavia, are, sometimes, used, in, a, political, sense, to, refer, to, norway, sweden, denmark, and, finland, the, term, scandinavian, may, be, used, with, two, principal, meanings, in, an, ethnic, or, cultural, sense, and, as, a, modern, and, more, inclusive, demonym, in, the, ethnic, or, cultural, sense, the, term, scandinavian, traditionally, refers, to, speakers, of, scandinavian, languages, who, are, mainly, descendants, of, the, peoples, historically, known, as, norsemen, but, also, to, some, extent, of, immigrants, and, others, who, have, been, assimilated, into, that, culture, and, language, in, this, sense, the, term, refers, primarily, to, native, danes, norwegians, and, swedes, as, well, as, descendants, of, scandinavian, settlers, such, as, the, icelanders, and, the, faroese, the, term, is, also, used, in, this, ethnic, sense, to, refer, to, the, modern, descendants, of, the, norse, in, studies, of, linguistics, and, culture, additionally, the, term, scandinavian, is, used, demonymically, to, refer, to, all, modern, inhabitants, or, citizens, of, scandinavian, countries, within, scandinavia, the, demonymic, term, primarily, refers, to, inhabitants, or, citizens, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, in, english, usage, inhabitants, or, citizens, of, iceland, the, faroe, islands, and, finland, are, sometimes, included, as, well, english, general, dictionaries, often, define, the, noun, scandinavian, demonymically, as, meaning, any, inhabitant, of, scandinavia, which, might, be, narrowly, conceived, or, broadly, conceived, there, is, a, certain, ambiguity, and, political, contestation, as, to, which, peoples, should, be, referred, to, as, scandinavian, in, this, broader, sense, s, mi, people, who, live, in, norway, and, sweden, are, generally, included, as, scandinavians, in, the, demonymic, sense, the, s, mi, of, finland, may, be, included, in, english, usage, but, usually, not, in, local, usage, the, s, mi, of, russia, are, not, included, however, the, use, of, the, term, scandinavian, with, reference, to, the, s, mi, is, complicated, by, the, historical, attempts, by, scandinavian, majority, peoples, and, governments, in, norway, and, sweden, to, assimilate, the, s, mi, people, into, the, scandinavian, culture, and, languages, making, the, inclusion, of, the, s, mi, as, scandinavians, controversial, among, many, s, mi, modern, s, mi, politicians, and, organizations, often, stress, the, status, of, the, s, mi, as, a, people, separate, from, and, equal, to, the, scandinavians, with, their, own, language, and, culture, and, are, apprehensive, about, being, included, as, scandinavians, in, light, of, earlier, scandinavian, assimilation, policies, two, language, groups, have, coexisted, on, the, scandinavian, peninsula, since, prehistory, the, north, germanic, languages, scandinavian, languages, and, the, uralic, languages, s, mi, and, finnish, most, people, in, scandinavia, today, speak, scandinavian, languages, that, evolved, from, old, norse, originally, spoken, by, ancient, germanic, tribes, in, southern, scandinavia, the, continental, scandinavian, languages, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, form, a, dialect, continuum, and, are, considered, mutually, intelligible, the, insular, scandinavian, languages, faroese, and, icelandic, on, the, other, are, only, partially, intelligible, to, speakers, of, the, continental, scandinavian, languages, the, uralic, languages, are, linguistically, unrelated, to, the, scandinavian, languages, finnish, is, the, majority, language, in, finland, and, a, recognized, minority, language, in, sweden, me, nkieli, and, kven, sometimes, considered, as, dialects, of, finnish, are, recognized, minority, languages, in, sweden, and, norway, respectively, the, s, mi, languages, are, indigenous, minority, languages, in, scandinavia, spoken, by, the, s, mi, people, in, northern, scandinavia, the, north, germanic, languages, of, scandinavia, are, traditionally, divided, into, an, east, scandinavian, branch, danish, and, swedish, and, a, west, scandinavian, branch, norwegian, icelandic, and, faroese, but, because, of, changes, appearing, in, the, languages, since, 1600, the, east, scandinavian, and, west, scandinavian, branches, are, now, usually, reconfigured, into, insular, scandinavian, nordisk, y, nordisk, featuring, icelandic, and, faroese, and, continental, scandinavian, skandinavisk, comprising, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, the, modern, division, is, based, on, the, degree, of, mutual, comprehensibility, between, the, languages, in, the, two, branches, the, populations, of, the, scandinavian, countries, with, common, scandinavian, roots, in, language, can, at, least, with, some, training, understand, each, other, s, standard, languages, as, they, appear, in, print, and, are, heard, on, radio, and, television, the, reason, danish, swedish, and, the, two, official, written, versions, of, norwegian, nynorsk, and, bokm, l, are, traditionally, viewed, as, different, languages, rather, than, dialects, of, one, common, language, is, that, each, is, a, well, established, standard, language, in, its, respective, country, danish, swedish, and, norwegian, have, since, medieval, times, been, influenced, to, varying, degrees, by, middle, low, german, and, standard, german, that, influence, was, due, not, only, to, proximity, but, also, to, the, rule, of, denmark, and, later, denmark, norway, over, the, german, speaking, region, of, holstein, and, to, sweden, s, close, trade, with, the, hanseatic, league, norwegians, are, accustomed, to, variation, and, may, perceive, danish, and, swedish, only, as, slightly, more, distant, dialects, this, is, because, they, have, two, official, written, standards, in, addition, to, the, habit, of, strongly, holding, on, to, local, dialects, the, people, of, stockholm, sweden, and, copenhagen, denmark, have, the, greatest, difficulty, in, understanding, other, scandinavian, languages, in, the, faroe, islands, and, iceland, learning, danish, is, mandatory, this, causes, faroese, people, as, well, as, icelandic, people, to, become, bilingual, in, two, very, distinct, north, germanic, languages, making, it, relatively, easy, for, them, to, understand, the, other, two, mainland, scandinavian, languages, although, iceland, was, under, the, political, control, of, denmark, until, a, much, later, date, 1918, very, little, influence, and, borrowing, from, danish, has, occurred, in, the, icelandic, language, icelandic, remained, the, preferred, language, among, the, ruling, classes, in, iceland, danish, was, not, used, for, official, communications, most, of, the, royal, officials, were, of, icelandic, descent, and, the, language, of, the, church, and, law, courts, remained, icelandic, the, scandinavian, languages, are, as, a, language, family, unrelated, to, finnish, and, the, s, mi, languages, which, as, uralic, languages, are, distantly, related, each, other, owing, to, the, close, proximity, there, is, still, a, great, deal, of, borrowing, from, the, swedish, and, norwegian, languages, in, finnish, and, the, s, mi, the, long, history, of, linguistic, influence, of, swedish, on, finnish, is, also, due, to, the, fact, that, that, swedish, was, the, dominant, language, when, finland, was, part, of, sweden, finnish, speakers, had, to, learn, swedish, in, order, to, advance, to, higher, positions, swedish, spoken, in, today, s, finland, includes, a, lot, of, words, that, are, borrowed, from, finnish, whereas, the, written, language, remains, closer, to, that, of, sweden, finland, is, officially, bilingual, with, finnish, and, swedish, having, mostly, the, same, status, at, national, level, finland, s, majority, population, are,

stretch, and, constitutes, approximately, 5, of, the, finnish, population, the, coastal, province, of, ostrobothnia, has, a, swedish, speaking, majority, whereas, plenty, of, areas, on, this, coastline, are, nearly, unilingually, finnish, like, the, region, of, satakunta, land, an, autonomous, province, of, finland, situated, in, the, baltic, sea, between, finland, and, sweden, are,

are, amongst, those, protected, in, parts, of, scandinavia, under, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, a, key, ancient, description, of, scandinavia, was, provided, by, pliny, the, elder, though, his, mentions, of, scatinavia, and, surrounding, areas, are, not, always, easy, to, decipher, writing, in, the, capacity, of, a, roman, admiral, he, introduces, the, northern, region, by, declaring, to, his, roman, readers, that, there, are, 23, islands, romanis, armis, cognitae, known, to, roman, arms, in, this, area, according, to, pliny, the, clarissima, most, famous, of, the, region, s, islands, is, scatinavia, of, unknown, size, there, live, the, hilleviones, the, belief, that, scandinavia, was, an, island, became, widespread, among, classical, authors, during, the, 1st, century, and, dominated, descriptions, of, scandinavia, in, classical, texts, during, the, centuries, that, followed, pliny, begins, his, description, of, the, route, to, scatinavia, by, referring, to, the, mountain, of, saevo, mons, saevo, ibi, the, codanus, bay, codanus, sinus, and, the, cimbrian, promontory, the, geographical, features, have, been, identified, in, various, ways, by, some, scholars, saevo, is, thought, to, be, the, mountainous, norwegian, coast, at, the, entrance, to, skagerrak, and, the, cimbrian, peninsula, is, thought, to, be, skagen, the, north, tip,
