ciuszko, mound, in, krak, w, poland, an, exploration, party, led, by, strzelecki, and, james, macarthur, beside, him, with, indigenous, guides, charlie, tarra, and, jackey, set, off, on, what, is, called, strzelecki, s, southern, expedition, macarthur, was, seeking, new, pastures, strzelecki, wanted, to, investigate, the, climate, geology, paleontology, and, geography, of, nsw, and, to, publish, his, findings, this, included, identifying, australia, s, highest, summit, which, strzelecki, reached, on, 12, march, 1840, the, approach, was, made, from, geehi, valley, after, climbing, hannel, s, spur, the, peak, now, named, mount, townsend, was, reached, here, strzelecki, used, his, instruments, to, make, observations, mt, townsend, is, australia, s, second, highest, mountain, adjacent, to, and, almost, the, same, height, as, mt, kosciuszko, and, strzelecki, saw, that, the, neighbouring, peak, was, slightly, higher, in, the, presence, of, macarthur, he, named, the, higher, summit, mount, kosciusko, after, the, famous, polish, lithuanian, military, leader, who, died, in, 1817, as, it, was, late, macarthur, decided, to, return, to, camp, and, strzelecki, alone, climbed, the, kosciuszko, summit, based, on, strzelecki, s, records, australia, s, highest, summit, was, mapped, a, cartographical, mistake, made, in, an, edition, of, victorian, maps, transposed, mount, kosciusko, to, the, position, of, the, present, mount, townsend, later, editions, of, the, map, continued, to, show, the, original, location, nsw, maps, did, not, make, this, mistake, the, victorian, error, created, confusion, in, 1885, austrian, explorer, robert, von, lendenfeld, guided, by, james, m, spencer, a, local, pastoralist, aided, by, a, map, containing, the, transposition, error, reached, mount, townsend, believing, it, was, mount, kosciusko, according, to, spencer, the, local, aboriginals, called, mount, kosciusko, tar, gan, gil, like, strzelecki, lendenfeld, also, observed, that, the, neighbouring, peak, was, higher, he, named, it, mount, townsend, to, honour, the, surveyor, who, in, 1846, traversed, the, peak, lendenfeld, claimed, he, had, identified, and, reached, the,

lendenfeld, s, announcement, created, further, confusion, when, lendenfeld, s, mistake, was, corrected, a, popular, legend, was, created, that, the, established, names, of, the, two, mountains, were, swapped, rather, than, re, educate, the, populace, of, the, name, of, the, highest, mountain, the, confusion, was, straightened, out, in, 1940, by, b, t, dowd, a, cartographer, and, historian, of, the, nsw, lands, department, his, study, reaffirmed, that, the, mountain, named, by, strzelecki, as, mount, kosciuszko, was, indeed, as, the, nsw, maps, had, always, shown, australia, s, highest, summit, when, macarthur, s, field, book, of, the, historical, journey, was, published, in, 1941, by, c, daley, it, further, confirmed, dowd, s, clarification, this, means, that, targangil, mentioned, in, spencer, s, 1885, article, was, the, indigenous, name, of, mount, townsend, not, of, mount, kosciusko, according, to, a, e, j, andrews, mount, kosciuszko, had, no, indigenous, name, detailed, analysis, of, the, mountain, history, can, be, found, in, books, by, h, p, g, clews, and, in, the, cited, a, e, j, andrews, book, kosciusko, the, mountain, in, history, the, name, of, the, mountain,

the, traditional, english, pronunciation, of, kosciuszko, is, k, z, i, s, k, o, koz, ee, us, koh, but, the, pronunciation, k, k, o, kosh, uush, koh, is, now, sometimes, used, which, is, substantially,
