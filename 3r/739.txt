20th, centuries, andalusia, has, historically, been, an, agricultural, region, compared, to, the, rest, of, spain, and, the, rest, of, europe, still, the, growth, of, the, community, in, the, sectors, of, industry, and, services, was, above, average, in, spain, and, higher, than, many, communities, in, the, eurozone, the, region, has, a, rich, culture, and, a, strong, identity, many, cultural, phenomena, that, are, seen, internationally, as, distinctively, spanish, are, largely, or, entirely, andalusian, in, origin, these, include, flamenco, and, to, a, lesser, extent, bullfighting, and,

disputed, and, the, extent, of, iberian, territory, encompassed, by, the, name, has, changed, over, the, centuries, traditionally, it, has, been, assumed, to, be, derived, from, the, name, of, the, vandals, since, the, 1980s, a, number, of, proposals, have, challenged, this, contention, halm, in, 1989, derived, the, name, from, a, gothic, term, landahlauts, and, in, 2002, bossong, suggested, its, derivation, from, a, pre, roman, substrate, the, spanish, place, name, andaluc, a, immediate, source, of, the, english, andalusia, was, introduced, into, the, spanish, languages, in, the, 13th, century, under, the, form, el, andaluc, a, the, name, was, adopted, to, refer, to, those, territories, still, under, moorish, rule, and, generally, south, of, castilla, nueva, and, valencia, and,

al, andalus, the, name, given, by, the, arabs, to, all, of, the, iberian, territories, under, muslim, rule, from, 711, to, 1492, the, etymology, of, al, andalus, is, itself, somewhat, debated, see, al, andalus, but, in, fact, it, entered, the, arabic, language, before, this, area, came, under, moorish, rule, like, the, arabic, term, al, andalus, in, historical, contexts, the, spanish, term, andaluc, a, or, the, english, term, andalusia, do, not, necessarily, refer, to, the, exact, territory, designated, by, these, terms, today, initially, the, term, referred, exclusively, to,

suitable, for, agriculture, also, being, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, baetic, cordillera, means, that, they, receive, a, lesser, volume, of, water, the, following, hydrographic, basins, can, be, distinguished, in, andalusia, on, the, atlantic, side, are, the, guadalquivir, basin, the, andalusian, atlantic, basin, with, the, sub, basins, guadalete, barbate, and, tinto, odiel, and, the, guadiana, basin, on, the, mediterranean, side, is, the, andalusian, mediterranean, basin, and, the, upper, portion, of, the, basin, of, the, segura, the, soils, of, andalusia, can, be, divided, into, three, large, areas, the, sierra, morena, cordillera, subb, tica, and, the, baetic, depression, and, the, surco, intrab, tico, the, sierra, morena, due, to, its, morphology, and, the, acidic, content, of, its, rocks, developed, principally, relatively, poor, shallow, soils, suitable, only, for, forests, in, the, valleys, and, in, some, areas, where, limestone, is, present, deeper, soils, allowed, farming, of, cereals, suitable, for, livestock, the, more, complicated, morphology, of, the, baetic, cordillera, makes, it, more, heterogeneous, with, the, most, heterogeneous, soils, in, andalusia, very, roughly, in, contrast, to, the, sierra, morena, a, predominance, of, basic, alkaline, materials, in, the, cordillera, subb, tica, combined, with, a, hilly, landscape, generates, deeper, soils, with, greater, agricultural, capacity, suitable, to, the, cultivation, of, olives, finally, the, baetic, depression, and, the, surco, intrab, tico, have, deep, rich, soils, with, great, agricultural, capacity, in, particular, the, alluvial, soils, of, the, guadalquivir, valley, and, plain, of, granada, have, a, loamy, texture, and, are, particularly, suitable, for, intensive, irrigated, crops, in, the, hilly, areas, of, the, countryside, there, is, a, double, dynamic, the, depressions, have, filled, with, older, lime, rich, material, developing, the, deep, rich, dark, clay, soils, the, spanish,

settlers, from, the, phoenicians, to, the, greeks, who, influenced, the, development, of, early, cultures, like, los, millares, el, argar, and, tartessos, these, early, andalusian, societies, played, a, vital, role, in, the, region, s, transition, from, prehistory, to, protohistory, with, the, roman, conquest, andalusia, became, fully, integrated, into, the, roman, world, as, the, prosperous,

political, shift, as, andalusia, became, a, focal, point, of, al, andalus, the, muslim, controlled, iberian, peninsula, the, city, of, c, rdoba, emerged, as, the, capital, of, al, andalus, and, one, of, the, most, important, cultural, and, economic, centers, of, the, medieval, world, the, height, of, andalusian, prosperity, came, during, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, under, rulers, like, abd, al, rahman, iii, and, al, hakam, ii, when, the, region, became, known, for, its, advancements, in, science, philosophy, and, architecture, however, the, 11th, century, brought, internal, divisions, with, the, fragmentation, of, al, andalus, into, taifas, small, independent, kingdoms, which, allowed, the, reconquista, to, push, southwards, by, the, late, 13th, century, much, of, andalusia, had, been,

practice, they, still, had, informal, recognition, as, geographic, cultural, historical, or, in, some, cases, administrative, entities, the, 2007, statute, of, autonomy, echoes, this, practice, and, mentions, comarcas, in, article, 97, of, title, iii, which, defines, the, significance, of, comarcas, and, establishes, a, basis, for, formal, recognition, in, future, legislation, the, current, statutory, entity, that, most, closely, resembles, a, comarca, is, the, mancomunidad, a, freely, chosen, bottom, up, association, of, municipalities, intended, as, an, instrument, of, socioeconomic, development, and, coordination, between, municipal, governments, in, specific, areas, beyond, the, level, of, provinces, andalusia, is, further, divided, into, 774, municipalities, municipios, the, municipalities, of, andalusia, are, regulated, by, title, iii, of, the, statute, of, autonomy, articles, 91, 95, which, establishes, the, municipality, as, the, basic, territorial, entity, of, andalusia, each, of, which, has, legal, personhood, and, autonomy, in, many, aspects, of, its, internal, affairs, at, the, municipal, level, representation, government, and, administration, is, performed, by, the, ayuntamiento, municipal, government, which, has, competency, for, urban, planning, community, social, services, supply, and, treatment, of, water, collection, and, treatment, of,

usually, rendered, as, villages, or, other, similar, names, andalusia, ranks, first, by, population, among, the, 17, autonomous, communities, of, spain, the, estimated, population, at, the, beginning, of, 2023, was, 8, 538, 376, the, population, is, concentrated, above, all, in, the, provincial, capitals, and, along, the, coasts, so, that, the, level, of, urbanization, is, quite, high, half, the, population, is, concentrated, in, the, 28, cities, of, more, than, 50, 000, inhabitants, the, population, is, aging, although, the, process, of, immigration, is, countering, the, inversion, of, the, population, pyramid, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, andalusia, was, in, the, last, phase, of, demographic, transition, the, death, rate, stagnated, at, around, 8, 9, per, thousand, and, the, population, came, to, be, influenced, mainly, by, birth, and, migration, in, 1950, andalusia, had, 20, 04, percent, of, the, national, population, of, spain, by, 1981, this, had, declined, to, 17, 09, percent, although, the, andalusian, population, was, not, declining, in, absolute, terms, these, relative, losses, were, due, to, emigration, great, enough, to, nearly, counterbalance, having, the, highest, birth, rate, in, spain, since, the, 1980s, this, process, has, reversed, on, all, counts, and, as, of, 2009, andalusia, has, 17, 82, percent, of, the, spanish, population, the, birth, rate, is, sharply, down, as, is, typical, in, developed, economies, although, it, has, lagged, behind, much, of, the, rest, of, the, world, in, this, respect, furthermore, prior, emigrants, have, been, returning, to, andalusia, beginning, in, the, 1990s, others, have, been, immigrating, in, large, numbers, as, well, as, spain, has, become, a, country, of, net, immigration, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, statistics, show, a, slight, increase, in, the, birth, rate, due, in, large, part, to, the, higher, birth, rate, among, immigrants, the, result, is, that, as, of, 2009, the, trend, toward, rejuvenation, of, the, population, is, among, the, strongest, of, any, autonomous, community, of, spain, or, of, any, comparable, region, in, europe, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, the, population, structure, of, andalusia, shows, a, clear, inversion, of, the, population, pyramid, with, the, largest, cohorts, falling, between, ages, 25, and, 50, comparison, of, the, population, pyramid, in, 2008, to, that, in, 1986, shows, as, far, as, composition, by, sex, two, aspects, stand, out, the, higher, percentage, of, women, in, the, elderly, population, owing, to, women, s, longer, life, expectancy, and, on, the, other, hand, the, higher, percentage, of, men, of, working, age, due, in, large, part, to, a, predominantly, male, immigrant, population, in, 2005, 5, 35, percent, of, the, population, of, andalusia, were, born, outside, of, spain, this, is, a, relatively, low, number, for, a, spanish, region, the, national, average, being, three, percentage, points, higher, the, immigrants, are, not, evenly, distributed, among, the, andalusian, provinces, almer, a, with, a, 15, 20, percent, immigrant, population, is, third, among, all, provinces, in, spain, while, at, the, other, extreme, ja, n, is, only, 2, 07, percent, immigrants, and, c, rdoba, 1, 77, percent, the, predominant, nationalities, among, the, immigrant, populations, are, moroccan, 92, 500, constituting, 17, 79, percent, of, the, foreigners, living, in, andalusia, and, british, 15, 25, percent, across, the, region, when, comparing, world, regions, rather, than, individual, countries, the, single, largest, immigrant, block, is, from, the, region, of, latin, america, outnumbering, not, only, all, north, africans, but, also, all, non, spanish, western, europeans, demographically, this, group, has, provided, an, important, addition, to, the, andalusian, labor, force, andalusia, is, traditionally, an, agricultural, area, but, the, service, sector, particularly, tourism, retail, sales, and, transportation, now, predominates, the, once, booming, construction, sector, hit, hard, by, the, 2009, recession, was, also, important, to, the, region, s, economy, the, industrial, sector, is, less, developed, than, most, other, regions, in, spain, between, 2000, and, 2006, economic, growth, per, annum, was, 3, 72, one, of, the, highest, in, the, country, still, according, to, the, spanish, instituto, nacional, de, estad, stica, ine, the, gdp, per, capita, of, andalusia, 17, 401, 2006, remains, the, second, lowest, in, spain, with, only, extremadura, lagging, behind, the, gross, domestic, product, gdp, of, the, autonomous, community, was, 160, 6, billion, euros, in, 2018, accounting, for, 13, 4, of, spanish, economic, output, gdp, per, capita, adjusted, for, purchasing, power, was, 20, 500, euros, or, 68, of, the, eu27, average, in, the, same, year, the, primary, sector, despite, adding, the, least, of, the, three, sectors, to, the, regional, gdp, remains, important, especially, when, compared, to, typical, developed, economies, the, primary, sector, produces, 8, 26, percent, of, regional, gdp, 6, 4, percent, of, its, gva, and, employs, 8, 19, percent, of, the, workforce, in, monetary, terms, it, could, be, considered, a, rather, uncompetitive, sector, given, its, level, of, productivity, compared, to, other, spanish, regions, in, addition, to, its, numeric, importance, relative, to, other, regions, agriculture, and, other, primary, sector, activities, have, strong, roots, in, local, culture, and, identity, the, primary, sector, is, divided, into, a, number, of, subsectors, agriculture, commercial, fishing, animal, husbandry, hunting, forestry, mining, and, energy, for, many, centuries, agriculture, dominated, andalusian, society, and, with, 44, 3, percent, of, its, territory, cultivated, and, 8, 4, percent, of, its, workforce, in, agriculture, as, of, 2016, it, remains, an, integral, part, of, andalusia, s, economy, however, its, importance, is, declining, like, the, primary, and, secondary, sectors, generally, as, the, service, sector, is, increasingly, taking, over, the, primary, cultivation, is, dryland, farming, of, cereals, and, sunflowers, without, artificial, irrigation, especially, in, the, vast, countryside, of, the, guadalquivir, valley, and, the, high, plains, of, granada, and, almer, a, with, a, considerably, lesser, and, more, geographically, focused, cultivation, of, barley, and, oats, using, irrigation, maize, cotton, and, rice, are, also, grown, on, the, banks, of, the, guadalquivir, and, genil, the, most, important, tree, crops, are, olives, especially, in, the, subbetic, regions, of, the, provinces, of, c, rdoba, and, j, en, where, irrigated, olive, orchards, constitute, a, large, component, of, agricultural, output, there, are, extensive, vineyards, in, various, zones, such, as, jerez, de, la, frontera, sherry, condado, de, huelva, montilla, moriles, and, m, laga, fruits, mainly, citrus, fruits, are, grown, near, the, banks, of, the, guadalquivir, almonds, which, require, far, less, water, are, grown, on, the, high, plains, of, granada, and, almer, a, in, monetary, terms, by, far, the, most, productive, and, competitive, agriculture, in, andalusia, is, the, intensive, forced, cultivation, of, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and, other, fruits, grown, under, hothouse, conditions, under, clear, plastic, often, in, sandy, zones, on, the, coasts, in, almer, a, and, huelva, organic, farming, has, recently, undergone, rapid, expansion, in, andalusia, mainly, for, export, to, european, markets, but, with, increasing, demand, developing, in, spain, andalusia, has, a, long, tradition, of, animal, husbandry, and, livestock, farming, but, it, is, now, restricted, mainly, to, mountain, meadows, where, there, is, less, pressure, from, other, potential, uses, andalusians, have, a, long, and, colourful, history, of, dog, breeding, that, can, be, observed, throughout, the, region, today, the, raising, of, livestock, now, plays, a, semi, marginal, role, in, the, andalusian, economy, constituting, only, 15, percent, of, the, primary, sector, half, the, number, for, spain, taken, as, a, whole, extensive, raising, of, livestock, grazes, the, animals, on, natural, or, cultivated, pastures, whereas, intensive, raising, of, livestock, is, based, in, fodder, rather, than, pasture, although, the, productivity, is, higher, than, with, extensive, techniques, the, economics, are, quite, different, while, intensive, techniques, now, dominate, in, europe, and, even, in, other, regions, of, spain, most, of, andalusia, s, cattle, virtually, all, of, its, sheep, and, goats, and, a, good, portion, of, its, pigs, are, raised, by, extensive, farming, in, mountain, pastures, this, includes, the, black, iberian, pigs, that, are, the, source, of, jam, n, ib, rico, andalusia, s, native, sheep, and, goats, present, a, great, economic, opportunity, in, a, europe, where, animal, products, are, generally, in, strong, supply, but, the, sheep, and, goat, meat, milk, and, leather, and, the, products, derived, from, these, are, relatively, scarce, dogs, are, bred, not, just, as, companion, animals, but, also, as, herding, animals, used, by, goat, and, sheep, herders, hunting, remains, relatively, important, in, andalusia, but, has, largely, lost, its, character, as, a, means, of, obtaining, food, it, is, now, more, of, a, leisure, activity, linked, to, the, mountain, areas, and, complementary, to, forestry, and, the, raising, of, livestock, dogs, are, frequently, used, as, hunting, companions, to, retrieve, killed, game, the, andalusian, forests, are, important, for, their, extent, 50, percent, of, the, territory, of, andalusia, and, for, other, less, quantifiable, environmental, reasons, such, as, their, value, in, preventing, erosion, regulating, the, flow, of, water, necessary, for, other, flora, and, fauna, for, these, reasons, there, is, legislation, in, place, to, protect, the, andalusian, forests, the, value, of, forest, products, as, such, constitutes, only, 2, percent, of, agricultural, production, this, comes, mostly, from, cultivated, species, eucalyptus, in, huelva, and, poplar, in, granada, as, well, as, naturally, occurring, cork, oak, in, the, sierra, morena, fishing, is, a, longstanding, tradition, on, the, andalusian, coasts, fish, and, other, seafood, have, long, figured, prominently, in, the, local, diet, and, in, the, local, gastronomic, culture, fried, fish, pescaito, frito, in, local, dialect, white, prawns, almadraba, tuna, among, others, the, andalusian, fishing, fleet, is, spain, s, second, largest, after, galicia, and, andalusia, s, 38, fishing, ports, are, the, most, of, any, spanish, autonomous, community, commercial, fishing, produces, only, 0, 5, percent, of, the, product, of, the, regional, primary, sector, by, value, but, there, are, areas, where, it, has, far, greater, importance, in, the, province, of, huelva, it, constitutes, 20, percent, of, the, primary, sector, and, locally, in, punta, umbr, a, 70, percent, of, the, work, force, is, involved, in, commercial, fishing, failure, to, comply, with, fisheries, laws, regarding, the, use, of, trawling, urban, pollution, of, the, seacoast, destruction, of, habitats, by, coastal, construction, for, example, alteration, of, the, mouths, of, rivers, construction, of, ports, and, diminution, of, fisheries, by, overexploitation, have, created, a, permanent, crisis, in, the, andalusian, fisheries, justifying, attempts, to, convert, the, fishing, fleet, the, decrease, in, fish, stocks, has, led, to, the, rise, of, aquaculture, including, fish, farming, both, on, the, coasts, and, in, the, interior, despite, the, general, poor, returns, in, recent, years, mining, retains, a, certain, importance, in, andalusia, andalusia, produces, half, of, spain, s, mining, product, by, value, of, andalusia, s, production, roughly, half, comes, from, the, province, of, huelva, mining, for, precious, metals, at, minas, de, riotinto, in, huelva, see, rio, tinto, group, dates, back, to, pre, roman, times, the, mines, were, abandoned, in, the, middle, ages, and, rediscovered, in, 1556, other, mining, activity, is, coal, mining, in, the, guadiato, valley, in, the, province, of, c, rdoba, various, metals, at, aznalc, llar, in, the, province, of, seville, and, iron, at, alquife, in, the, province, of, granada, in, addition, limestone, clay, and, other, materials, used, in, construction, are, well, distributed, throughout, andalusia, the, andalusian, industrial, sector, has, always, been, relatively, small, nevertheless, in, 2007, andalusian, industry, earned, 11, 979, million, euros, and, employed, more, than, 290, 000, workers, this, represented, 9, 15, percent, of, regional, gdp, far, below, the, 15, 08, the, secondary, sector, represents, in, the, economy, of, spain, as, a, whole, by, analyzing, the, different, subsectors, of, the, food, industry, andalusian, industry, accounts, for, more, than, 16, of, total, production, in, a, comparison, with, the, spanish, economy, this, subsector, is, virtually, the, only, food, that, has, some, weight, in, the, national, economy, with, 16, 16, lies, far, behind, the, manufacturing, sector, of, shipping, materials, just, over, 10, of, the, spanish, economy, companies, like, cruzcampo, heineken, group, puleva, domecq, santana, motors, or, renault, andalusia, are, exponents, of, these, two, subsectors, of, note, is, the, andalusian, aeronautical, sector, which, is, second, nationally, only, behind, madrid, and, represents, approximately, 21, of, total, turnover, in, terms, of, employment, highlighting, companies, like, airbus, airbus, military, or, the, newly, formed, aerospace, alestis, on, the, contrary, it, is, symptomatic, of, how, little, weight, the, regional, economy, in, such, important, sectors, such, as, textiles, or, electronics, at, the, national, level, andalusian, industry, is, also, characterized, by, a, specialization, in, industrial, activities, of, transforming, raw, agricultural, and, mineral, materials, this, is, largely, done, by, small, enterprises, without, the, public, or, foreign, investment, more, typical, of, a, high, level, of, industrialization, in, recent, decades, the, andalusian, tertiary, service, sector, has, grown, greatly, and, has, come, to, constitute, the, majority, of, the, regional, economy, as, is, typical, of, contemporary, economies, in, developed, nations, in, 1975, the, service, sector, produced, 51, 1, percent, of, local, gdp, and, employed, 40, 8, percent, of, the, work, force, in, 2007, this, had, risen, to, 67, 9, percent, of, gdp, and, 66, 42, percent, of, jobs, this, process, of, tertiarization, of, the, economy, has, followed, a, somewhat, unusual, course, in, andalusia, this, growth, occurred, somewhat, earlier, than, in, most, developed, economies, and, occurred, independently, of, the, local, industrial, sector, there, were, two, principal, reasons, that, tertiarization, followed, a, different, course, in, andalusia, than, elsewhere, 1, andalusian, capital, found, it, impossible, to, compete, in, the, industrial, sector, against, more, developed, regions, and, was, obligated, to, invest, in, sectors, that, were, easier, to, enter, 2, the, absence, of, an, industrial, sector, that, could, absorb, displaced, agricultural, workers, and, artisans, led, to, the, proliferation, of, services, with, rather, low, productivity, this, unequal, development, compared, to, other, regions, led, to, a, hypertrophied, and, unproductive, service, sector, which, has, tended, to, reinforce, underdevelopment, because, it, has, not, led, to, large, accumulations, of, capital, due, in, part, to, the, relatively, mild, winter, and, spring, climate, the, south, of, spain, is, attractive, to, overseas, visitors, especially, tourists, from, northern, europe, while, inland, areas, such, as, ja, n, c, rdoba, and, the, hill, villages, and, towns, remain, relatively, untouched, by, tourism, the, coastal, areas, of, andalusia, have, heavy, visitor, traffic, for, much, of, the, year, among, the, autonomous, communities, andalusia, is, second, only, to, catalonia, in, tourism, with, nearly, 30, million, visitors, every, year, the, principal, tourist, destinations, in, andalusia, are, the, costa, del, sol, and, secondarily, the, sierra, nevada, as, discussed, above, andalusia, is, one, of, the, sunniest, and, warmest, places, in, europe, making, it, a, center, of, sun, and, sand, tourism, but, not, only, it, around, 70, percent, of, the, lodging, capacity, and, 75, percent, of, the, nights, booked, in, andalusian, hotels, are, in, coastal, municipalities, the, largest, number, of, tourists, come, in, august, 13, 26, percent, of, the, nights, booked, throughout, the, year, and, the, smallest, number, in, december, 5, 36, percent, on, the, west, atlantic, coast, are, the, costa, de, la, luz, provinces, of, huelva, and, c, diz, and, on, the, east, mediterranean, coast, the, costa, del, sol, provinces, of, c, diz, y, m, laga, costa, tropical, granada, and, part, of, almer, a, and, the, costa, de, almer, a, in, 2004, the, blue, flag, beach, program, of, the, non, profit, foundation, for, environmental, education, recognized, 66, andalusian, beaches, and, 18, pleasure, craft, ports, as, being, in, a, good, state, of, conservation, in, terms, of, sustainability, accessibility, and, quality, nonetheless, the, level, of, tourism, on, the, andalusian, coasts, has, been, high, enough, to, have, a, significant, environmental, impact, and, other, organizations, such, as, the, spanish, ecologists, in, action, ecologistas, en, acci, n, with, their, description, of, black, flag, beaches, or, greenpeace, have, expressed, the, opposite, sentiment, still, hotel, chains, such, as, fuerte, hotels, have, ensured, that, sustainability, within, the, tourism, industry, is, one, of, their, highest, priorities, together, with, sand, and, sun, tourism, there, has, also, been, a, strong, increase, in, nature, tourism, in, the, interior, as, well, as, cultural, tourism, sport, tourism, and, conventions, one, example, of, sport, and, nature, tourism, is, the, ski, resort, at, sierra, nevada, national, park, as, for, cultural, tourism, there, are, hundreds, of, cultural, tourist, destinations, cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and, historic, city, centers, and, a, wide, variety, of, museums, it, can, be, highlighted, that, spain, has, seven, of, its, 42, cultural, unesco, world, heritage, sites, in, andalucia, further, there, are, the, lugares, colombinos, significant, places, in, the, life, of, christopher, columbus, palos, de, la, frontera, la, r, bida, monastery, and, moguer, in, the, province, of, huelva, there, are, also, archeological, sites, of, great, interest, the, roman, city, of, italica, birthplace, of, emperor, trajan, and, most, likely, hadrian, or, baelo, claudia, near, tarifa, andalusia, was, the, birthplace, of, such, great, painters, as, vel, zquez, and, murillo, seville, and, more, recently, picasso, m, laga, picasso, is, memorialized, by, his, native, city, at, the, museo, picasso, m, laga, and, natal, house, foundation, the, casa, de, murillo, was, a, house, museum, 1982, 1998, but, is, now, mostly, offices, for, the, andalusian, council, of, culture, the, cac, m, laga, museum, of, modern, art, archived, 20, november, 2011, at, the, wayback, machine, is, the, most, visited, museum, of, andalusia, and, has, offered, exhibitions, of, artists, such, as, louise, bourgeois, jake, and, dinos, chapman, gerhard, richter, anish, kapoor, ron, mueck, or, rodney, graham, malaga, is, also, located, part, of, the, private, carmen, thyssen, bornemisza, collection, at, carmen, thyssen, museum, there, are, numerous, other, significant, museums, around, the, region, both, of, paintings, and, of, archeological, artifacts, such, as, gold, jewelry, pottery, and, other, ceramics, and, other, works, that, demonstrate, the, region, s, artisanal, traditions, the, council, of, government, has, designated, the, following, municipios, tur, sticos, in, almer, a, roquetas, de, mar, in, c, diz, chiclana, de,

society, transport, systems, are, an, essential, structural, element, of, the, functioning, of, andalusia, the, transportation, network, facilitates, territorial, coordination, economic, development, and, distribution, and, intercity, transportation, in, urban, transport, underdeveloped, public, transport, systems, put, pedestrian, traffic, and, other, non, motorized, traffic, are, at, a, disadvantage, compared, to, the, use, of, private, vehicles, several, andalusian, capitals, c, rdoba, granada, and, seville, have, recently, been, trying, to, remedy, this, by, strengthening, their, public, transport, systems, and, providing, a, better, infrastructure, for, the, use, of, bicycles, there, are, now, three, rapid, transit, systems, operating, in, andalucia, the, seville, metro, m, laga, metro, and, granada, metro, cercan, as, commuter, rail, networks, operate, in, seville, m, laga, and, c, diz, for, over, a, century, the, conventional, rail, network, has, been, centralized, on, the, regional, capital, seville, and, the, national, capital, madrid, in, general, there, are, no, direct, connections, between, provincial, capitals, high, speed, ave, trains, run, from, madrid, via, c, rdoba, to, seville, and, m, laga, from, which, a, branch, from, antequera, to, granada, opened, in, 2019, further, ave, routes, are, under, construction, the, madrid, c, rdoba, seville, route, was, the, first, high, velocity, route, in, spain, operating, since, 1992, other, principal, routes, are, the, one, from, algeciras, to, seville, and, from, almer, a, via, granada, to, madrid, most, of, the, principal, roads, have, been, converted, into, limited, access, highways, known, as, autov, as, the, autov, a, del, este, autov, a, a, 4, runs, from, madrid, through, the, despe, aperros,

2013, which, plans, an, investment, of, 30, billion, euros, during, that, period, the, lack, of, high, quality, fossil, fuels, in, andalusia, has, led, to, a, strong, dependency, on, petroleum, imports, still, andalusia, has, a, strong, potential, for, the, development, of, renewable, energy, above, all, wind, energy, the, andalusian, energy, agency, established, in, 2005, by, the,
