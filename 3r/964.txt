metres, 4, ft, 11, in, above, sea, level, most, of, the, area, was, originally, swampland, which, was, gradually, drained, and, irrigated, for, agriculture, by, the, construction, of, canals, khlong, which, took, place, from, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, the, course, of, the, river, as, it, flows, through, bangkok, has, been, modified, by, the, construction, of, several, shortcut, canals, the,

thickness, which, overlies, an, aquifer, system, consisting, of, eight, known, units, this, feature, has, contributed, to, the, effects, of, subsidence, caused, by, extensive, groundwater, pumping, first, discovered, in, the, 1970s, subsidence, soon, became, a, critical, issue, reaching, a, rate, of, 120, millimetres, 4, 7, in, per, year, in, 1981, ground, water, management, and, mitigation, measures, have, since, lessened, the, severity, of, the, situation, and, the, rate, of, subsidence, decreased, to, 10, to, 30, millimetres, 0, 39, to, 1, 18, in, per, year, in, the, early, 2000s, though, parts, of, the, city, are, now, 1, metre, 3, ft, 3, in, below, sea, level, subsidence, has, resulted, in, increased, flood, risk, as, bangkok, is, already, prone, to, flooding, due, to, its,

2011, in, 2011, most, of, bangkok, s, northern, eastern, and, western, districts, were, flooded, in, some, places, for, over, two, months, bangkok, s, coastal, location, makes, it, particularly, vulnerable, to, rising, sea, levels, due, to, global, warming, and, climate, change, a, study, by, the, oecd, has, estimated, that, 5, 138, million, people, in, bangkok, may, be, exposed, to, coastal, flooding, by, 2070, the, seventh, highest, figure, among, the, world, s, port, cities, 8, there, are, fears, that, the, city, may, be, submerged, by, 2030, a, study, published, in, october, 2019, in, nature, communications, corrected, earlier, models, of, coastal, elevations, and, concluded, that, up, to, 12, million, thais, mostly, in, the, greater, bangkok, metropolitan, area, face, the, prospect, of, annual, flooding, events, this, is, compounded, by, coastal, erosion, which, is, an, issue, in, the, gulf, coastal, area, a, small, length, of, which, lies, within, bangkok, s, bang, khun, thian, district, tidal, flat, ecosystems, existed, on, the, coast, however, many, have, been, reclaimed, for, agriculture, aquaculture, and, salt, works, there, are, no, mountains, in, bangkok,

large, chedi, that, king, rama, iii, 1787, 1851, built, at, wat, saket, the, chedi, collapsed, during, construction, because, the, soft, soil, could, not, support, its, weight, over, the, next, few, decades, the, abandoned, mud, and, brick, structure, acquired, the, shape, of, a, natural, hill, and, became, overgrown, with, weeds, the, locals, called, it, phu, khao, as, if, it, were, a, natural,

jams, other, factors, including, high, vehicle, ownership, rate, relative, to, income, level, inadequate, public, transport, systems, and, lack, of, transportation, demand, management, also, play, a, role, efforts, to, alleviate, the, problem, have, included, the, construction, of, intersection, bypasses, and, an, extensive, system, of, elevated, highways, as, well, as, the, creation, of, several,
