the, seaside, city, of, callao, it, forms, a, contiguous, urban, area, known, as, the, lima, metropolitan, area, which, encompasses, a, total, of, 10, 151, 200, inhabitants, when, considering, the, constitutional, province, of, callao, the, total, agglomeration, reaches, a, population, of, 11, 342, 100, inhabitants, one, of, the, thirty, most, populated, urban, agglomerations, in, the, world, lima, was, named, by, natives, in, the, agricultural, region, known, by, native, peruvians, as, limaq, it, became, the, capital, and, most, important, city, in, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, following, the, peruvian, war, of, independence, it, became, the, capital, of, the, republic, of, peru, rep, blica, del, per, around, one, third, of, the, national, population, now, lives, in, its, metropolitan, area, in, october, 2013, lima, was, chosen, to, host, the, 2019, pan, american, games, these, games, were, held, at, venues, in, and, around, lima, and, were, the, largest, sporting, event, ever, hosted, by, the, country, it, also, hosted, the, apec, meetings, of, 2008, and, 2016, the, annual, meetings, of, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, group, in, october, 2015, the, united, nations, climate, change, conference, in, december, 2014, and, the, miss, universe, 1982, contest, according, to, early, spanish, articles, the, lima, area, was, once, called, itchyma, after, its, original, inhabitants, however, even, before, the, inca, occupation, of, the, area, in, the, 15th, century, a, famous, oracle, in, the, r, mac, valley, had, come, to, be, known, by, visitors, as, limaq, limaq, pronounced, which, means, talker, or, speaker, in, the, coastal, quechua, that, was, the, area, s, primary, language, before, the, spanish, arrival, this, oracle, was, eventually, destroyed, by, the, spanish, and, replaced, with, a, church, but, the, name, persisted, the, chronicles, show, l, mac, replacing, ychma, as, the, common, name, for, the, area, modern, scholars, speculate, that, the, word, lima, originated, as, the, spanish, pronunciation, of, the, native, name, limaq, linguistic, evidence, seems, to, support, this, theory, as, spoken, spanish, consistently, rejects, stop, consonants, in, word, final, position, the, city, was, founded, in, 1535, under, the, name, city, of, kings, spanish, ciudad, de, los, reyes, because, its, foundation, was, decided, on, january, 6, date, of, the, feast, of, the, epiphany, this, name, quickly, fell, into, disuse, and, lima, became, the, city, s, name, of, choice, on, the, oldest, spanish, maps, of, peru, both, lima, and, ciudad, de, los, reyes, can, be, seen, together, the, river, that, feeds, lima, is, called, r, mac, and, many, people, erroneously, assume, that, this, is, because, its, original, inca, name, is, talking, river, the, incas, spoke, a, highland, variety, of, quechua, in, which, the, word, for, talker, was, pronounced, however, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, valley, were, not, incas, this, name, is, an, innovation, arising, from, an, effort, by, the, cuzco, nobility, in, colonial, times, to, standardize, the, toponym, so, that, it, would, conform, to, the, phonology, of, cuzco, quechua, later, as, the, original, inhabitants, died, out, and, the, local, quechua, became, extinct, the, cuzco, pronunciation, prevailed, nowadays, spanish, speaking, locals, do, not, see, the, connection, between, the, name, of, their, city, and, the, name, of, the, river, that, runs, through, it, they, often, assume, that, the, valley, is, named, after, the, river, however, spanish, documents, from, the, colonial, period, show, the, opposite, to, be, true, the, flag, of, lima, is, historically, known, as, banner, of, the, city, of, the, kings, of, peru, it, is, formed, by, a, golden, colored, silk, canvas, and, in, the, center, is, the, embroidered, coat, of, arms, of, the, city, the, coat, of, arms, of, lima, was, granted, by, the, spanish, crown, on, 7, december, 1537, through, a, real, c, dula, signed, in, valladolid, by, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, and, his, mother, queen, joanna, of, castile, it, is, formed, by, a, main, field, azure, with, three, gold, crowns, of, kings, placed, in, a, triangle, and, above, them, a, gold, star, that, touches, the, three, crowns, with, its, points, and, in, the, orle, some, gold, letters, that, say, hoc, signum, vere, regum, est, this, is, the, true, sign, of, the, kings, outside, the, shield, are, the, initials, i, and, k, ioana, and, karolus, which, are, the, names, of, queen, joanna, and, her, son, charles, v, a, star, is, placed, above, the, letters, and, two, crowned, sabre, faced, eagles, embracing, them, which, hold, the, coat, of, arms, the, anthem, of, lima, was, heard, for, the, first, time, on, 18, january, 2008, in, a, solemn, session, that, was, attended, by, the, then, president, of, peru, alan, garc, a, the, mayor, of, the, city, luis, casta, eda, lossio, and, various, authorities, those, in, charge, of, creating, the, anthem, were, the, councillors, luis, enrique, tord, author, of, the, lyrics, euding, maeshiro, composer, of, the, melody, and, the, musical, producer, ricardo, n, ez, arranger, although, the, history, of, the, city, of, lima, began, with, its, spanish, foundation, in, 1535, the, territory, formed, by, the, valleys, of, the, r, mac, chill, n, and, lur, n, rivers, was, occupied, by, pre, inca, settlements, which, were, grouped, under, the, lordship, of, ichma, the, maranga, culture, and, the, lima, culture, were, the, ones, that, established, and, forged, an, identity, in, these, territories, during, those, times, the, sanctuaries, of, lati, current, puruchuco, and, pachac, mac, the, main, pilgrimage, sanctuary, during, the, time, of, the, incas, were, built, it, was, built, from, 3rd, century, to, 15th, century, by, several, civilizations, and, which, was, used, even, until, the, time, the, spanish, conquistadors, arrived, these, cultures, were, conquered, by, the, wari, empire, during, the, height, of, its, imperial, expansion, it, is, during, this, time, that, the, ceremonial, center, of, cajamarquilla, was, built, as, wari, importance, declined, local, cultures, regained, autonomy, highlighting, the, chancay, culture, later, in, the, 15th, century, these, territories, were, incorporated, into, the, inca, empire, from, this, time, we, can, find, a, great, variety, of, huacas, throughout, the, city, some, of, which, are, under, investigation, the, most, important, or, well, known, huacas, are, those, of, huallamarca, pucllana, and, mateo, salado, all, located, in, the, middle, of, lima, districts, with, very, high, urban, growth, so, they, are, surrounded, by, business, and, residential, buildings, however, that, does, not, prevent, its, perfect, state, of, conservation, during, the, time, of, the, incas, the, valley, of, lima, was, highly, populated, and, organized, into, an, inca, province, or, huamani, wamani, called, pachacamac, the, colonial, spanish, historian, bernab, cobo, mentions, that, the, huamani, of, pachacamac, was, subdivided, into, three, hunu, of, tributary, men, rather, than, the, conventional, four, hunu, it, has, also, been, argued, that, a, fourth, hunu, may, have, existed, but, was, not, recorded, the, primary, meaning, of, the, word, hunu, in, quechua, is, 10, 000, leading, to, the, assumption, that, 30, 000, families, lived, in, the, valley, this, assumption, has, been, criticized, including, by, the, historian, ke, wedin, because, hunu, can, also, mean, countless, and, therefore, could, simply, refer, to, a, very, large, group, of, men, the, scholar, john, rowe, suggested, that, the, valley, had, a, population, of, about, 150, 000, during, inca, times, whatever, the, case, each, recorded, hunu, of, pachacamac, had, a, head, town, corresponding, to, some, of, the, most, populated, settlements, in, the, valley, caraguayllo, carabayllo, maranga, and, surco, or, sulco, also, known, as, the, archaeological, site, armatambo, this, valley, was, divided, according, to, the, government, of, the, inca, kings, into, three, unos, or, governorships, of, ten, thousand, families, each, the, town, of, caraguayllo, was, the, head, of, the, first, that, of, maranga, which, is, situated, in, the, middle, of, the, valley, of, the, second, and, the, third, that, of, surco, this, last, town, was, the, largest, of, all, the, inhabitants, of, the, pre, columbian, town, of, surco, were, relocated, to, the, modern, district, of, santiago, de, surco, early, in, the, colonial, period, in, addition, to, aymara, and, quechua, the, inhabitants, of, the, northern, part, of, the, valley, specifically, in, the, hunu, of, carabayllo, spoke, an, additional, language, believed, to, be, quingnam, regarding, the, pre, hispanic, settlement, of, lima, it, is, recorded, that, this, part, of, the, valley, near, the, rimac, river, was, administered, by, a, curaca, or, local, lord, named, taulichusco, he, was, a, former, yana, or, servant, of, mama, vilo, one, of, the, wives, of, emperor, huayna, capac, lima, was, awarded, to, taulichusco, in, recognition, of, his, services, to, the, inca, royalty, some, of, peru, s, most, important, buildings, were, erected, on, the, sites, of, major, constructions, of, the, pre, hispanic, settlement, for, example, the, residential, palace, of, taulichusco, was, located, where, the, modern, palacio, de, gobierno, of, peru, stands, today, a, temple, called, puma, inti, once, occupied, the, site, where, the, cathedral, of, lima, is, now, and, the, municipal, theatre, of, lima, is, situated, where, a, pre, columbian, structure, referred, to, as, huaca, el, cabildo, by, the, spaniards, once, stood, these, buildings, were, centered, around, a, plaza, which, was, later, expanded, to, become, the, plaza, mayor, the, huaca, de, aliaga, and, huaca, riquelme, were, other, major, buildings, near, the, plaza, other, nearby, constructions, included, the, temple, oracle, of, r, mac, one, of, the, main, places, of, worship, in, the, valley, also, known, as, the, so, called, huaca, grande, that, once, stood, in, barrios, altos, in, 1532, the, spanish, and, their, indigenous, allies, from, the, ethnic, groups, subdued, by, the, incas, under, the, command, of, francisco, pizarro, took, monarch, atahualpa, prisoner, in, the, city, of, cajamarca, although, a, ransom, was, paid, he, was, sentenced, to, death, for, political, and, strategic, reasons, after, some, battles, the, spanish, conquered, their, empire, the, spanish, crown, named, francisco, pizarro, governor, of, the, lands, he, had, conquered, pizarro, decided, to, found, the, capital, in, the, r, mac, river, valley, after, a, failed, attempt, to, establish, it, in, jauja, he, considered, that, lima, was, strategically, located, close, to, a, favorable, coast, for, the, construction, of, a, port, but, prudently, far, from, it, in, order, to, prevent, attacks, by, pirates, and, foreign, powers, on, fertile, lands, and, with, a, suitable, cool, climate, thus, on, 6, january, 1535, lima, was, founded, with, the, name, city, of, the, kings, named, in, this, way, in, honor, of, the, epiphany, on, territories, that, had, been, of, the, kuraka, taulichusco, the, explanation, of, this, name, is, due, to, the, fact, that, around, the, same, time, in, january, the, spaniards, were, looking, for, the, place, to, lay, the, foundation, for, the, new, city, not, far, from, the, pachac, mac, sanctuary, near, the, r, mac, river, however, as, had, happened, with, the, region, initially, called, new, castile, and, later, peru, the, city, of, the, kings, soon, lost, its, name, in, favor, of, lima, pizarro, with, the, collaboration, of, nicol, s, de, ribera, diego, de, ag, ero, and, francisco, quintero, personally, traced, the, plaza, mayor, and, the, rest, of, the, city, grid, building, the, viceroyalty, palace, today, transformed, into, the, government, palace, of, peru, which, hence, retains, the, traditional, name, of, casa, de, pizarro, and, the, cathedral, whose, first, stone, pizarro, laid, with, his, own, hands, in, august, 1536, the, flourishing, city, was, besieged, by, the, troops, of, the, inca, general, quizu, yupanqui, under, orders, from, the, monarch, manco, inca, yupanqui, who, was, in, cusco, but, the, spanish, and, their, indigenous, allies, managed, to, defeat, them, the, huaylas, wayllas, army, s, assistance, was, of, special, importance, to, the, spanish, the, army, arrived, personally, led, by, contarhuancho, kuntur, wanchu, a, secondary, wife, of, the, deceased, emperor, wayna, qhapaq, and, now, a, respected, kuraka, of, half, the, province, of, huaylas, the, hanan, huaylas, or, upper, huaylas, moiety, contarhuancho, came, to, lima, after, receiving, a, plea, for, help, in, a, quipu, message, from, her, daughter, the, huaylas, inca, princess, do, a, in, s, huaylas, yupanqui, in, the, following, years, lima, gained, prestige, by, being, designated, the, capital, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, and, the, seat, of, a, real, audiencia, in, 1543, since, the, location, of, the, coastal, city, was, conditioned, by, the, ease, of, communications, with, spain, a, close, bond, with, the, port, of, callao, was, soon, established, for, the, next, century, it, prospered, as, the, center, of, an, extensive, trade, network, that, integrated, the, viceroyalty, with, the, americas, europe, and, east, asia, but, the, city, was, not, without, its, dangers, violent, earthquakes, destroyed, a, large, part, of, it, between, 1586, and, 1687, leading, to, a, great, deal, of, construction, activity, it, is, then, when, aqueducts, starlings, and, retaining, walls, appear, before, the, flooding, of, the, rivers, the, bridge, over, the, r, mac, is, finished, the, cathedral, is, built, and, numerous, hospitals, convents, and, monasteries, are, built, then, we, can, see, that, the, city, is, articulated, around, its, neighborhoods, another, threat, was, the, presence, of, pirates, and, corsairs, in, the, pacific, ocean, which, motivated, the, construction, of, the, walls, of, lima, between, 1684, and, 1687, the, 1687, earthquake, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, lima, since, it, coincided, with, a, recession, in, trade, due, to, economic, competition, with, other, cities, such, as, buenos, aires, with, the, creation, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, in, 1717, the, political, demarcations, were, reorganized, and, lima, only, lost, some, territories, that, actually, already, enjoyed, their, autonomy, in, 1746, a, strong, earthquake, severely, damaged, the, city, and, destroyed, callao, forcing, a, massive, reconstruction, effort, by, viceroy, jos, antonio, manso, de, velasco, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, enlightenment, ideas, about, public, health, and, social, control, influenced, the, development, of, the, city, during, this, period, the, peruvian, capital, was, affected, by, the, bourbon, reforms, as, it, lost, its, monopoly, on, foreign, trade, and, its, control, over, the, important, mining, region, of, upper, peru, this, economic, weakening, led, the, elite, of, the, city, to, depend, on, the, positions, granted, by, the, viceregal, government, and, the, church, which, contributed, to, keeping, them, more, linked, to, the, crown, than, to, the, cause, of, independence, the, greatest, political, economic, impact, that, the, city, experienced, at, that, time, occurred, with, the, creation, of, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1776, which, changed, the, course, and, orientations, imposed, by, the, new, mercantile, traffic, among, the, buildings, built, during, this, period, there, is, the, coliseo, de, gallos, the, acho, bullring, and, the, general, cemetery, the, first, two, were, erected, to, regulate, these, popular, activities, centralizing, them, in, one, place, while, the, cemetery, put, an, end, to, the, practice, of, burying, the, dead, in, churches, considered, unhealthy, by, public, authorities, a, combined, expedition, of, argentine, and, chilean, independence, fighters, led, by, general, don, jos, de, san, mart, n, landed, in, southern, lima, in, 1820, but, did, not, attack, the, city, faced, with, a, naval, blockade, and, guerrilla, action, on, the, mainland, viceroy, jos, de, la, serna, was, forced, to, evacuate, the, city, in, july, 1821, to, save, the, royalist, army, fearing, a, popular, uprising, and, lacking, the, means, to, impose, the, order, the, city, council, invited, san, mart, n, to, enter, the, city, signing, a, declaration, of, independence, at, his, request, proclaimed, the, independence, of, peru, in, 1821, by, general, san, mart, n, lima, became, the, capital, of, the, new, republic, of, peru, thus, it, was, the, seat, of, the, government, of, the, liberator, and, also, the, seat, of, the, first, constituent, congress, that, the, country, had, the, war, lasted, for, two, more, years, during, which, the, city, changed, hands, many, times, and, suffered, abuses, from, both, sides, by, the, time, the, war, was, decided, on, 9, december, 1824, at, the, battle, of, ayacucho, lima, had, been, considerably, impoverished, after, the, war, of, independence, lima, became, the, capital, of, the, republic, of, peru, but, the, country, s, economic, stagnation, and, political, disorder, paralyzed, its, urban, development, this, situation, was, reversed, in, the, 1850s, when, the, growing, public, and, private, income, derived, from, the, export, of, guano, allowed, a, rapid, expansion, of, the, city, in, the, following, twenty, years, the, state, financed, the, construction, of, large, public, buildings, to, replace, the, old, viceregal, establishments, among, these, are, the, central, market, the, general, slaughterhouse, the, mental, asylum, the, penitentiary, and, the, hospital, dos, de, mayo, there, were, also, improvements, in, communications, in, 1850, a, railway, line, between, lima, and, callao, was, completed, and, in, 1870, an, iron, bridge, was, inaugurated, over, the, r, mac, river, baptized, as, puente, balta, in, 1872, the, colonial, city, walls, were, demolished, by, the, us, engineer, henry, meiggs, under, contract, with, the, peruvian, government, in, anticipation, of, further, urban, growth, in, the, future, however, this, period, of, economic, expansion, also, widened, the, gap, between, rich, and, poor, producing, widespread, social, unrest, during, the, war, of, the, pacific, 1879, 1883, the, chilean, army, occupied, lima, after, defeating, peruvian, troops, and, reserves, in, the, battles, of, san, juan, and, miraflores, the, city, suffered, from, the, invaders, who, looted, museums, public, libraries, and, educational, institutions, at, the, same, time, angry, mobs, attacked, wealthy, citizens, and, the, asian, colony, looting, their, properties, and, businesses, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, construction, of, avenues, that, would, serve, as, a, matrix, for, the, development, of, the, city, began, the, avenues, paseo, de, la, rep, blica, legu, a, today, called, arequipa, brasil, and, the, landscaping, salaverry, that, headed, south, and, venezuela, and, colonial, avenues, to, the, west, joining, the, port, of, callao, in, the, 1930s, the, great, constructions, began, with, the, remodeling, of, the, government, palace, of, peru, and, the, palacio, municipal, these, constructions, reached, their, peak, in, the, 1950s, during, the, government, of, manuel, a, odr, a, when, the, great, buildings, of, the, ministry, of, economy, and, the, ministry, of, education, were, built, javier, alzamora, valdez, building, currently, the, seat, of, the, superior, court, of, justice, of, lima, the, ministry, of, health, the, ministry, of, labor, and, the, hospitals, of, the, workers, insurance, and, of, the, employee, as, well, as, the, national, stadium, and, several, large, housing, units, also, in, those, years, a, phenomenon, began, that, changed, the, configuration, of, the, city, which, was, the, massive, immigration, of, inhabitants, from, the, interior, of, the, country, producing, the, exponential, growth, of, the, capital, s, population, and, the, consequent, urban, expansion, the, new, populations, were, settling, on, land, near, the, center, which, was, used, as, an, agricultural, area, the, current, districts, of, lince, la, victoria, to, the, south, were, populated, bre, a, and, pueblo, libre, to, the, west, el, agustino, ate, and, san, juan, de, lurigancho, to, the, east, and, san, mart, n, de, porres, and, comas, to, the, north, as, an, emblematic, point, of, this, expansion, in, 1973, the, self, managed, community, of, villa, el, salvador, current, district, of, villa, el, salvador, was, created, located, 30, km, south, of, the, city, center, and, currently, integrated, into, the, metropolitan, area, in, the, 1980s, terrorist, violence, added, to, the, disorderly, growth, of, the, city, the, increase, of, settlers, who, arrived, as, internally, displaced, persons, in, the, 1940s, lima, started, a, period, of, rapid, growth, spurred, by, migration, from, the, andean, region, as, rural, people, sought, opportunities, for, work, and, education, the, population, estimated, at, 600, 000, in, 1940, reached, 1, 9, million, by, 1960, and, 4, 8, million, by, 1980, at, the, start, of, this, period, the, urban, area, was, confined, to, a, triangular, area, bounded, by, the, city, s, historic, center, callao, and, chorrillos, in, the, following, decades, settlements, spread, to, the, north, beyond, the, r, mac, river, to, the, east, along, the, central, highway, and, to, the, south, the, new, migrants, at, first, confined, to, slums, in, downtown, lima, led, this, expansion, through, large, scale, land, invasions, which, evolved, into, shanty, towns, known, as, pueblos, j, venes, the, urban, area, covers, about, 800, km, 2, 310, sq, mi, it, is, located, on, mostly, flat, terrain, in, the, peruvian, coastal, plain, within, the, valleys, of, the, chill, n, r, mac, and, lur, n, rivers, the, city, slopes, gently, from, the, shores, of, the, pacific, ocean, into, valleys, and, mountain, slopes, located, as, high, as, 1, 550, meters, 5, 090, ft, above, sea, level, within, the, city, are, isolated, hills, that, are, not, connected, to, the, surrounding, hill, chains, such, as, el, agustino, san, cosme, el, pino, la, milla, muleria, and, pro, hills, the, san, cristobal, hill, in, the, r, mac, district, which, lies, directly, north, of, the, downtown, area, is, the, local, extreme, of, an, andean, hill, outgrowth, metropolitan, lima, covers, 2, 672, 28, km, 2, 1, 031, 77, sq, mi, of, which, 825, 88, km, 2, 318, 87, sq, mi, 31, comprise, the, actual, city, and, 1, 846, 40, km, 2, 712, 90, sq, mi, 69, the, city, outskirts, the, urban, area, extends, around, 60, km, 37, mi, from, north, to, south, and, around, 30, km, 19, mi, from, west, to, east, the, city,
