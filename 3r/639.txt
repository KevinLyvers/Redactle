outside, of, the, english, speaking, world, oceania, is, generally, considered, a, continent, while, australia, is, regarded, as, an, island, or, a, continental, landmass, within, that, continent, spanning, the, eastern, and, western, hemispheres, at, the, centre, of, the, water, hemisphere, oceania, is, estimated, to, have, a, land, area, of, about, 9, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 500, 000, sq, mi, and, a, population, of, around, 44, 4, million, as, of, 2022, oceania, is, the, smallest, continent, in, land, area, and, the, second, least, populated, after, antarctica, oceania, has, a, diverse, mix, of, economies, from, the, highly, developed, and, globally, competitive, financial, markets, of, australia, french, polynesia, hawaii, new, caledonia, and, new, zealand, which, rank, high, in, quality, of, life, and, human, development, index, to, the, much, less, developed, economies, of, kiribati, papua, new, guinea, tuvalu, vanuatu, and, western, new, guinea, the, largest, and, most, populous, country, in, oceania, is, australia, and, the, largest, city, is, sydney, puncak, jaya, in, indonesia, is, the, highest, peak, in, oceania, at, 4, 884, m, 16, 024, ft, the, first, settlers, of, australia, new, guinea, and, the, large, islands, just, to, the, east, arrived, more, than, 60, 000, years, ago, oceania, was, first, explored, by, europeans, from, the, 16th, century, onward, portuguese, explorers, between, 1512, and, 1526, reached, the, tanimbar, islands, some, of, the, caroline, islands, and, west, new, guinea, spanish, and, dutch, explorers, followed, then, british, and, french, on, his, first, voyage, in, the, 18th, century, james, cook, who, later, arrived, at, the, highly, developed, hawaiian, islands, went, to, tahiti, and, followed, the, east, coast, of, australia, for, the, first, time, the, arrival, of, european, settlers, in, subsequent, centuries, resulted, in, a, significant, alteration, in, the, social, and, political, landscape, of, oceania, the, pacific, theatre, saw, major, action, during, the, first, and, second, world, wars, the, rock, art, of, aboriginal, australians, is, the, longest, continuously, practiced, artistic, tradition, in, the, world, most, oceanian, countries, are, parliamentary, democracies, with, tourism, being, a, large, source, of, income, for, the, pacific, island, nations, definitions, of, oceania, vary, the, broadest, definition, encompasses, the, many, islands, between, mainland, asia, and, the, americas, the, island, nation, of, australia, is, the, only, piece, of, land, in, the, area, which, is, large, enough, to, typically, be, considered, a, continent, the, culture, of, the, people, who, lived, on, these, islands, was, often, distinct, from, that, of, asia, and, pre, columbian, america, before, europeans, arrived, in, the, area, the, sea, shielded, australia, and, south, central, pacific, islands, from, cultural, influences, that, spread, through, large, continental, landmasses, and, adjacent, islands, the, islands, of, the, malay, archipelago, north, of, australia, mainly, lie, on, the, continental, shelf, of, asia, and, their, inhabitants, had, more, exposure, to, mainland, asian, culture, as, a, result, of, this, closer, proximity, the, geographer, conrad, malte, brun, coined, the, french, expression, terres, oc, aniques, oceanic, lands, c, 1804, in, 1814, another, french, cartographer, adrien, hubert, bru, coined, from, this, expression, the, shorter, oc, anie, which, derives, from, the, latin, word, oceanus, and, this, from, the, greek, word, kean, s, ocean, the, term, oceania, is, used, because, unlike, the, other, continental, groupings, it, is, the, ocean, that, links, the, parts, of, the, region, together, john, eperjesi, s, 2005, book, the, imperialist, imaginary, says, that, it, has, been, used, by, western, cartographers, since, the, mid, 19th, century, to, give, order, to, the, complexities, of, the, pacific, area, in, the, 19th, century, many, geographers, divided, oceania, into, mostly, racially, based, subdivisions, australasia, malesia, encompassing, the, malay, archipelago, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, the, 2011, book, maritime, adaptations, of, the, pacific, by, richard, w, casteel, and, jean, claude, passeron, states, that, for, the, purpose, of, anthropology, oceania, has, long, been, a, continent, like, africa, asia, and, america, scottish, geographer, john, bartholomew, wrote, in, 1873, that, the, new, world, consists, of, north, america, and, the, peninsula, of, south, america, attached, to, it, these, divisions, generally, themselves, spoken, as, continents, and, to, them, has, been, added, another, embracing, the, large, island, of, australia, and, numerous, others, in, the, ocean, under, the, name, of, oceania, there, are, thus, six, great, divisions, of, the, earth, europe, asia, africa, north, america, south, america, and, oceania, american, author, samuel, griswold, goodrich, wrote, in, his, 1854, book, history, of, all, nations, that, geographers, have, agreed, to, consider, the, island, world, of, the, pacific, ocean, as, a, third, continent, under, the, name, oceania, in, this, book, the, other, two, continents, were, categorized, as, being, the, new, world, the, americas, and, the, old, world, afro, eurasia, in, his, 1879, book, australasia, british, naturalist, alfred, russel, wallace, commented, that, oceania, is, the, word, often, used, by, continental, geographers, to, describe, the, great, world, of, islands, we, are, now, entering, upon, and, that, australia, forms, its, central, and, most, important, feature, he, did, not, explicitly, label, oceania, a, continent, in, the, book, but, did, note, that, it, was, one, of, the, six, major, divisions, of, the, world, the, oxford, handbook, of, world, history, 2011, describes, the, areas, encompassed, in, oceania, as, being, afterthoughts, in, world, history, texts, lumped, together, and, included, at, the, end, of, global, surveys, as, areas, largely, marginal, to, the, main, events, of, world, history, the, new, terms, near, oceania, and, remote, oceania, were, proposed, in, 1973, by, anthropologists, roger, green, and, andrew, pawley, by, their, definition, near, oceania, consists, of, new, guinea, the, bismarck, archipelago, and, the, solomon, islands, with, the, exception, of, the, santa, cruz, islands, they, are, designed, to, dispel, the, outdated, categories, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, many, scholars, now, replace, those, categories, with, green, s, terms, since, the, early, 1990s, but, the, old, categories, are, still, used, in, science, popular, culture, and, general, usage, islands, at, the, geographic, extremes, of, oceania, are, generally, considered, to, be, the, bonin, islands, a, politically, integral, part, of, japan, hawaii, a, state, of, the, united, states, clipperton, island, a, possession, of, france, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, belonging, to, chile, and, macquarie, island, belonging, to, australia, the, united, nations, un, has, used, its, own, geopolitical, definition, of, oceania, since, its, foundation, in, 1947, which, utilizes, four, of, the, five, subregions, from, the, 19th, century, australasia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, this, definition, consists, of, discrete, political, entities, and, so, excludes, the, bonin, islands, hawaii, clipperton, island, and, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, along, with, easter, island, which, was, annexed, by, chile, in, 1888, it, is, used, in, statistical, reports, by, the, international, olympic, committee, and, by, many, atlases, the, un, categorizes, oceania, and, by, extension, the, pacific, area, as, one, of, the, major, continental, divisions, of, the, world, along, with, africa, asia, europe, and, the, americas, their, definition, includes, american, samoa, australia, and, their, external, territories, the, cook, islands, federated, states, of, micronesia, french, polynesia, fiji, guam, kiribati, the, marshall, islands, nauru, new, caledonia, new, zealand, niue, the, northern, mariana, islands, palau, papua, new, guinea, pitcairn, islands, samoa, the, solomon, islands, tokelau, tonga, tuvalu, vanuatu, wallis, and, futuna, and, the, united, states, minor, outlying, islands, baker, island, howland, island, jarvis, island, midway, atoll, palmyra, atoll, and, wake, island, the, original, un, definition, of, oceania, from, 1947, included, these, same, countries, and, semi, independent, territories, which, were, mostly, still, colonies, at, that, point, hawaii, had, not, yet, become, a, u, s, state, in, 1947, and, as, such, was, part, of, the, original, un, definition, of, oceania, the, island, states, of, indonesia, japan, the, philippines, singapore, and, taiwan, all, located, within, the, bounds, of, the, pacific, or, associated, marginal, seas, are, excluded, from, the, un, definition, the, states, of, hong, kong, and, malaysia, located, in, both, mainland, asia, and, marginal, seas, of, the, pacific, are, also, excluded, as, are, brunei, east, timor, and, indonesian, new, guinea, western, new, guinea, the, cia, world, factbook, also, categorizes, oceania, as, one, of, the, major, continental, divisions, of, the, world, but, the, name, australia, and, oceania, is, used, their, definition, does, not, include, all, of, australia, s, external, territories, but, is, otherwise, the, same, as, the, un, s, definition, and, is, also, used, for, statistical, purposes, the, pacific, islands, forum, expanded, during, the, early, 2010s, and, areas, that, were, already, included, in, the, un, definition, of, oceania, such, as, french, polynesia, gained, membership, french, writer, gustave, d, eichthal, remarked, in, 1844, that, the, boundaries, of, oceania, are, in, reality, those, of, the, great, ocean, itself, conrad, malte, brun, in, 1824, defined, oceania, as, covering, australia, new, zealand, the, islands, of, polynesia, which, then, included, all, the, pacific, islands, and, the, malay, archipelago, american, lexicographer, joseph, emerson, worcester, wrote, in, 1840, that, oceania, is, a, term, applied, to, a, vast, number, of, islands, which, are, widely, dispersed, in, the, pacific, ocean, they, are, considered, as, forming, a, fifth, grand, division, of, the, world, he, also, viewed, oceania, as, covering, australia, new, zealand, the, malay, archipelago, and, the, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, in, 1887, the, royal, asiatic, society, of, great, britain, and, ireland, referred, to, australia, as, the, area, s, westernmost, land, while, in, 1870, british, reverend, alexander, mackay, identified, the, bonin, islands, as, its, northernmost, point, and, macquarie, island, as, its, southernmost, point, the, bonin, islands, at, that, time, were, a, possession, of, britain, macquarie, island, to, the, south, of, tasmania, is, a, subantarctic, island, in, the, pacific, it, was, politically, associated, with, australia, and, tasmania, by, 1870, alfred, russel, wallace, believed, in, 1879, that, oceania, extended, to, the, aleutian, islands, which, are, among, the, northernmost, islands, of, the, pacific, the, islands, now, politically, associated, with, alaska, have, historically, had, inhabitants, that, were, related, to, indigenous, americans, in, addition, to, having, non, tropical, biogeography, similar, to, that, of, alaska, and, siberia, wallace, insisted, while, the, surface, area, of, this, wide, definition, was, greater, than, that, of, asia, and, europe, combined, the, land, area, was, only, a, little, greater, than, that, of, europe, american, geographer, sophia, s, cornell, claimed, that, the, aleutian, islands, were, not, part, of, oceania, in, 1857, she, stated, that, oceania, was, divided, up, into, three, groups, australasia, which, included, australia, new, zealand, and, the, melanesian, islands, malesia, which, included, all, present, day, countries, within, the, malay, archipelago, not, the, modern, country, of, malaysia, and, polynesia, which, included, both, the, polynesian, and, micronesian, islands, in, her, definition, aside, from, mainland, australia, areas, that, she, identified, as, of, high, importance, were, borneo, hawaii, indonesia, s, java, and, sumatra, new, guinea, new, zealand, the, philippines, french, polynesia, s, society, islands, tasmania, and, tonga, american, geographer, jesse, olney, s, 1845, book, a, practical, system, of, modern, geography, stated, that, it, comprises, the, numerous, isles, of, the, pacific, lying, south, east, of, asia, olney, divided, up, oceania, into, three, groups, australasia, which, included, australia, new, guinea, and, new, zealand, malesia, and, polynesia, which, included, the, combined, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, in, his, definition, publication, missionary, review, of, the, world, claimed, in, 1895, that, oceania, was, divided, up, into, five, groups, australasia, malesia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, it, did, not, consider, hawaii, to, be, part, of, polynesia, due, to, its, geographic, isolation, commenting, that, oceania, also, included, isolated, groups, and, islands, such, as, the, hawaiian, and, gal, pagos, in, 1876, french, geographer, lis, e, reclus, labelled, australia, s, flora, as, one, of, the, most, characteristic, on, the, globe, adding, that, the, hawaiian, archipelago, also, constitutes, a, separate, vegetation, zone, of, all, tropical, insular, groups, it, possesses, the, relatively, largest, number, of, endemic, plants, in, the, gal, pagos, group, also, more, than, half, of, the, species, are, of, local, origin, rand, mcnally, company, an, american, publisher, of, maps, and, atlases, claimed, in, 1892, that, oceania, comprises, the, large, island, of, australia, and, the, innumerable, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, also, that, the, islands, of, the, malay, archipelago, should, be, grouped, in, with, asia, british, linguist, robert, needham, cust, argued, in, 1887, that, the, malay, archipelago, should, be, excluded, since, it, had, participated, in, asian, civilization, cust, considered, oceania, s, four, subregions, to, be, australasia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, new, zealand, was, categorized, by, him, as, being, in, polynesia, and, the, only, country, in, his, definition, of, australasia, was, australia, his, definition, of, polynesia, included, both, easter, island, and, hawaii, which, had, not, yet, been, annexed, by, either, chile, or, the, united, states, the, journal, of, the, royal, statistical, society, stated, in, 1892, that, australia, was, a, large, island, within, oceania, rather, than, a, small, continent, it, additionally, commented, it, is, certainly, not, necessary, to, consider, the, hawaiian, islands, and, australia, as, being, in, the, same, part, of, the, world, it, is, however, permissible, to, unite, in, one, group, all, the, islands, which, are, scattered, over, the, great, ocean, it, should, be, remarked, that, if, we, take, the, malay, archipelago, away, from, oceania, as, do, generally, the, german, geographers, the, insular, world, contained, in, the, great, ocean, is, cut, in, two, and, the, least, populated, of, the, five, parts, of, the, world, is, diminished, in, order, to, increase, the, number, of, inhabitants, of, the, most, densely, populated, continent, regarding, australia, and, the, pacific, chambers, s, new, handy, volume, american, encyclop, dia, observed, in, 1885, that, the, whole, region, has, sometimes, been, called, oceania, and, sometimes, australasia, generally, however, in, modern, times, to, the, exclusion, of, the, islands, in, the, archipelago, to, which, certain, writers, have, given, the, name, of, malesia, it, added, there, was, controversy, over, the, exact, limits, of, oceania, saying, that, scarcely, any, two, geographers, appear, to, be, quite, agreed, upon, the, subject, british, physician, and, ethnologist, james, cowles, prichard, claimed, in, 1847, that, the, aleutian, islands, and, the, kuril, islands, form, the, northern, boundary, of, this, fifth, region, of, the, world, and, with, the, coasts, of, asia, and, america, completing, its, literal, termination, however, he, wrote, that, these, islands, are, not, usually, reckoned, as, belonging, to, it, because, they, are, known, to, be, inhabited, by, races, of, people, who, came, immediately, from, the, adjacent, continents, and, are, unconnected, with, those, tribes, of, the, human, race, who, peopled, the, remote, islands, of, this, great, ocean, he, added, that, hawaii, was, the, most, northerly, area, to, be, inhabited, by, races, associated, with, oceania, the, 1926, book, modern, world, history, 1776, 1926, by, alexander, clarence, flick, considered, oceania, to, include, all, islands, in, the, pacific, and, associated, the, term, with, the, malay, archipelago, the, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, the, aleutian, islands, japan, s, ryukyu, islands, taiwan, and, the, kuril, islands, he, further, included, in, his, definition, sakhalin, an, island, which, is, geologically, part, of, the, japanese, archipelago, but, that, has, been, administered, by, russia, since, world, war, ii, hong, kong, partly, located, in, another, marginal, sea, of, the, pacific, the, south, china, sea, was, also, included, in, his, definition, australia, and, new, zealand, were, grouped, together, by, flick, as, australasia, and, categorized, as, being, in, the, same, area, of, the, world, as, the, islands, of, oceania, flick, estimated, this, definition, of, oceania, had, a, population, of, 70, 000, 000, and, commented, that, brown, and, yellow, races, constitute, the, vast, majority, and, that, the, minority, of, whites, were, mainly, owners, and, rulers, hutton, webster, s, 1919, book, medieval, and, modern, history, also, considered, oceania, to, encompass, all, islands, in, the, pacific, stating, that, the, term, oceania, or, oceanica, in, its, widest, sense, applies, to, all, the, pacific, islands, webster, broke, oceania, up, into, two, subdivisions, the, continental, group, which, included, australia, the, japanese, archipelago, the, malay, archipelago, and, taiwan, and, the, oceanic, group, which, included, new, zealand, and, the, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, charles, marion, tyler, s, 1885, book, the, island, world, of, the, pacific, ocean, considered, oceania, to, ethnographically, encompass, australia, new, zealand, the, malay, archipelago, and, the, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, however, tyler, included, other, pacific, islands, in, his, book, as, well, such, as, the, aleutian, islands, the, bonin, islands, the, japanese, archipelago, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, the, kuril, islands, the, ryukyu, islands, taiwan, california, s, channel, islands, and, farallon, islands, canada, s, vancouver, island, and, queen, charlotte, islands, now, known, as, haida, gwaii, chile, s, chilo, island, ecuador, s, gal, pagos, islands, mexico, s, guadalupe, island, revillagigedo, islands, san, benito, islands, and, tres, mar, as, islands, and, peru, s, chincha, islands, islands, in, marginal, seas, of, the, pacific, were, also, covered, in, the, book, including, alaska, s, pribilof, islands, and, china, s, hainan, tyler, additionally, profiled, the, anson, archipelago, which, during, the, 19th, century, was, a, designation, for, a, widely, scattered, group, of, purported, islands, in, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, between, japan, and, hawaii, the, anson, archipelago, included, phantom, islands, such, as, ganges, island, and, los, jardines, which, were, proven, to, not, exist, as, well, as, real, islands, such, as, marcus, island, and, wake, island, tyler, described, australia, as, the, leviathan, of, the, island, groups, of, the, world, in, his, 1857, book, a, treatise, on, physical, geography, francis, b, fogg, commented, that, the, pacific, and, its, dependencies, may, be, said, to, contain, that, portion, of, the, globe, termed, oceanica, or, the, maritime, world, which, is, divided, into, australasia, malesia, and, polynesia, fogg, defined, polynesia, as, covering, the, combined, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, as, well, as, the, ryukyu, islands, he, added, that, besides, the, proceeding, the, pacific, contains, many, other, islands, of, which, the, most, important, are, hainan, and, formosa, on, the, coast, of, china, the, japan, isles, the, kuriles, the, aleutian, islands, stretching, from, the, new, world, to, the, old, vancouver, island, the, gal, pagos, juan, fern, ndez, and, chilo, scottish, academic, john, merry, ross, in, 1879, considered, polynesia, to, cover, the, entire, south, and, central, pacific, area, not, just, islands, ethnographically, within, polynesia, he, wrote, in, the, globe, encyclopedia, of, universal, information, that, literally, interpreted, the, name, would, include, all, the, groups, from, sumatra, to, the, gal, pagos, together, with, australia, ross, further, wrote, and, to, this, vast, region, the, term, oceania, has, been, applied, it, is, more, usual, at, the, present, time, however, to, exclude, the, archipelago, in, a, 1972, article, for, the, music, educators, journal, titled, musics, of, oceania, author, raymond, f, kennedy, wrote, many, meanings, have, been, given, to, the, word, oceania, the, most, inclusive, but, not, always, the, most, useful, embraces, about, 25, 000, land, areas, between, asia, and, the, americas, a, more, popular, and, practical, definition, excludes, indonesia, east, malaysia, borneo, the, philippines, taiwan, japan, and, other, islands, closely, related, to, the, asian, mainland, as, well, as, the, aleutians, and, the, small, island, groups, situated, near, the, americas, thus, oceania, most, commonly, refers, to, the, land, areas, of, the, south, and, central, pacific, kennedy, defined, oceania, as, including, australasia, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, the, u, s, government, publishing, office, s, area, handbook, for, oceania, from, 1971, states, that, australia, and, new, zealand, are, the, principal, large, sovereignties, of, the, area, it, further, states, in, its, broadest, definition, oceania, embraces, all, islands, and, island, groups, of, the, pacific, ocean, that, lie, between, asia, and, the, two, american, continents, in, popular, usage, however, the, designation, has, a, more, restricted, application, the, islands, of, the, north, pacific, such, as, the, aleutians, and, the, kuriles, usually, are, excluded, in, addition, the, series, of, sovereign, island, nations, fringing, asia, japan, taiwan, the, philippines, east, malaysia, the, republic, of, indonesia, are, not, ordinarily, considered, to, be, part, of, the, area, in, 1948, american, military, journal, armed, forces, talk, broke, the, islands, of, the, pacific, up, into, five, major, subdivisions, indonesia, melanesia, micronesia, polynesia, and, the, non, tropical, islands, the, indonesia, subdivision, consisted, of, the, islands, of, the, malay, archipelago, while, the, non, tropical, islands, were, categorized, as, being, north, pacific, islands, such, as, alaska, s, kodiak, archipelago, the, aleutian, islands, japan, the, kuril, islands, and, sakhalin, japan, s, bonin, and, ryukyu, islands, are, also, considered, to, be, subtropical, islands, with, the, main, japanese, archipelago, being, non, tropical, the, journal, associated, the, term, oceania, with, the, melanesian, micronesian, and, polynesian, subdivisions, but, not, with, the, indonesian, or, non, tropical, subdivisions, the, pacific, islands, handbook, 1945, by, robert, william, robson, stated, that, pacific, islands, generally, are, regarded, as, pacific, islands, lying, within, the, tropics, there, are, a, considerable, number, of, pacific, islands, outside, the, tropics, most, of, them, have, little, economic, or, political, importance, he, noted, the, political, significance, of, the, aleutian, islands, which, were, invaded, by, the, japanese, military, in, world, war, ii, and, categorized, new, zealand, s, antipodes, islands, auckland, islands, bounty, islands, campbell, islands, chatham, island, and, kermadec, islands, as, being, non, tropical, islands, of, the, south, pacific, along, with, australia, s, lord, howe, island, and, norfolk, island, the, kermadec, islands, lord, howe, island, and, norfolk, island, are, also, considered, to, be, subtropical, islands, other, non, tropical, areas, below, the, equator, such, as, chilo, island, macquarie, island, tasmania, and, the, southern, portions, of, mainland, australia, and, new, zealand, were, not, included, in, this, category, according, to, the, 1998, book, encyclopedia, of, earth, and, physical, sciences, oceania, refers, to, australasia, melanesia, micronesia, polynesia, and, more, than, 10, 000, islands, scattered, across, the, pacific, ocean, it, notes, that, the, term, also, come, under, scrutiny, by, many, geographers, some, experts, insist, that, oceania, encompasses, even, the, cold, aleutian, islands, and, the, islands, of, japan, disagreement, also, exists, over, whether, or, not, indonesia, the, philippines, and, taiwan, should, be, included, in, oceania, the, japanese, archipelago, the, malay, archipelago, and, taiwan, and, other, islands, near, china, are, often, deemed, as, a, geological, extension, of, asia, since, they, do, not, have, oceanic, geology, instead, being, detached, fragments, of, the, eurasian, continent, that, were, once, physiologically, connected, certain, japanese, islands, off, the, main, archipelago, are, not, geologically, associated, with, asia, the, book, the, world, and, its, peoples, australia, new, zealand, oceania, 1966, asserts, that, japan, taiwan, the, aleutian, islands, indonesia, the, philippines, and, malaysia, the, pacific, archipelagos, bordering, upon, the, far, east, asian, mainland, are, excluded, from, oceania, and, that, all, the, islands, lying, between, australia, and, the, americas, including, australia, are, part, of, oceania, furthermore, the, book, adds, that, hawaii, is, still, within, oceania, despite, being, politically, integrated, into, the, u, s, and, that, the, pacific, ocean, gives, unity, to, the, whole, since, all, these, varied, lands, emerge, from, or, border, upon, the, pacific, the, 1876, book, the, countries, of, the, world, by, british, scientist, and, explorer, robert, brown, labelled, the, malay, archipelago, as, northwestern, oceania, but, brown, still, noted, that, these, islands, belonged, more, to, the, asian, continent, they, are, now, often, referred, to, as, maritime, southeast, asia, with, indonesia, malaysia, the, philippines, and, singapore, being, founding, members, of, the, asean, regional, organization, for, southeast, asia, in, 1967, brunei, and, east, timor, did, not, exist, as, independent, nations, at, that, point, brown, also, categorized, japan, and, taiwan, as, being, in, the, same, part, of, the, world, as, the, islands, of, oceania, and, excluded, them, from, the, countries, of, the, world, volume, 5, which, covered, mainland, asia, and, hong, kong, however, brown, did, not, explicitly, associate, japan, or, taiwan, with, the, term, oceania, he, divided, oceania, into, two, subregions, eastern, oceania, which, included, the, islands, of, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, and, southwestern, oceania, which, included, australia, and, new, zealand, the, gal, pagos, islands, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, and, the, revillagigedo, islands, were, identified, as, the, easternmost, areas, of, oceania, in, the, book, brown, wrote, they, lie, nearest, the, american, continent, of, all, oceanic, islands, and, though, rarely, associated, with, polynesia, and, never, appearing, to, have, been, inhabited, by, any, aboriginal, races, are, in, many, ways, remarkable, and, interesting, brown, went, on, to, add, the, small, islands, lying, off, the, continent, like, the, queen, charlotte, s, in, the, north, pacific, the, farallones, off, california, and, the, chinchas, off, peru, are, to, all, intents, and, purposes, only, detached, bits, of, the, adjoining, shores, but, in, the, case, of, the, gal, pagos, at, least, this, is, different, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, and, the, neighbouring, desventuradas, islands, are, today, seen, as, the, easternmost, extension, of, the, indo, west, pacific, biogeographic, region, the, islands, lie, on, the, nazca, plate, with, easter, island, and, the, gal, pagos, islands, and, have, a, significant, south, central, pacific, component, to, their, marine, fauna, according, to, scientific, journal, plos, one, the, humboldt, current, helps, create, a, biogeographic, barrier, between, the, marine, fauna, of, these, islands, and, south, america, chile, s, government, have, occasionally, considered, them, to, be, within, oceania, along, with, easter, island, chile, s, government, also, categorize, easter, island, the, desventuradas, islands, and, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, as, being, part, of, a, region, titled, insular, chile, they, further, include, in, this, region, salas, y, g, mez, a, small, uninhabited, island, to, the, east, of, easter, island, plos, one, describe, insular, chile, as, having, cultural, and, ecological, connections, to, the, broader, insular, pacific, in, her, 1997, book, australia, and, oceania, australian, historian, kate, darian, smith, defined, the, area, as, covering, australia, new, zealand, and, the, islands, of, the, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, she, excluded, hawaii, from, her, definition, but, not, easter, island, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, stated, in, a, 1986, report, that, they, include, easter, island, in, their, definition, of, oceania, on, the, basis, of, its, polynesian, and, biogeographic, affinities, even, though, it, is, politically, apart, further, noting, that, other, oceanic, islands, administered, by, latin, american, countries, had, been, included, in, definitions, of, oceania, in, 1987, the, journal, of, australasian, cave, research, described, oceania, as, being, the, region, from, irian, jaya, western, new, guinea, a, province, of, new, guinea, in, the, west, to, gal, pagos, islands, equador, and, easter, island, chile, in, the, east, in, a, 1980, report, on, venereal, diseases, in, the, south, pacific, the, british, journal, of, venereal, diseases, categorized, the, desventuradas, islands, easter, island, the, gal, pagos, islands, and, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, as, being, in, an, eastern, region, of, the, south, pacific, along, with, areas, such, as, pitcairn, islands, and, french, polynesia, but, noted, that, the, gal, pagos, islands, were, not, a, member, of, the, south, pacific, commission, like, other, islands, in, the, south, pacific, the, south, pacific, commission, is, a, developmental, organization, formed, in, 1947, and, is, currently, known, as, the, pacific, community, its, members, include, australia, and, other, pacific, islands, forum, members, in, a, 1947, article, on, the, formation, of, the, south, pacific, commission, for, the, pacific, affairs, journal, author, roy, e, james, stated, the, organization, s, scope, encompassed, all, non, self, governing, islands, below, the, equator, to, the, east, of, papua, new, guinea, which, itself, was, included, in, the, scope, and, then, known, as, dutch, new, guinea, easter, island, and, the, gal, pagos, islands, were, defined, by, james, as, falling, within, the, organization, s, geographical, parameters, the, 2007, book, asia, in, the, pacific, islands, replacing, the, west, by, new, zealand, pacific, scholar, ron, crocombe, defined, the, term, pacific, islands, as, being, islands, in, the, south, pacific, commission, and, stated, that, such, a, definition, does, not, include, gal, pagos, and, other, islands, off, the, pacific, coast, of, the, americas, these, were, uninhabited, when, europeans, arrived, then, integrated, with, a, south, american, country, and, have, almost, no, contact, with, other, pacific, islands, he, adds, easter, island, still, participates, in, some, pacific, island, affairs, because, its, people, are, polynesian, thomas, sebeok, s, two, volume, 1971, book, linguistics, in, oceania, defines, easter, island, the, gal, pagos, islands, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, costa, rica, s, cocos, island, and, colombia, s, malpelo, island, all, oceanic, as, making, up, a, spanish, language, segment, of, oceania, cocos, island, and, malpelo, island, are, the, only, landmasses, located, on, the, cocos, plate, which, is, to, the, north, of, the, nazca, plate, the, book, observed, that, a, native, polynesian, language, was, still, understood, on, easter, island, unlike, with, the, other, islands, which, were, uninhabited, when, discovered, by, europeans, and, mostly, being, used, as, prisons, for, convicts, additionally, the, book, includes, taiwan, and, the, entire, malay, archipelago, as, part, of, oceania, while, not, oceanic, in, nature, taiwan, and, malay, archipelago, countries, like, indonesia, and, the, philippines, share, austronesian, ethnolinguistic, origins, with, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, hence, their, inclusion, in, the, book, hainan, which, neighbours, taiwan, also, has, austronesian, ethnolinguistic, origins, although, it, was, not, included, in, the, book, the, book, defined, oceania, s, major, subregions, as, being, australia, indonesia, which, included, all, areas, associated, with, the, malay, archipelago, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, in, 2010, australian, historian, bronwen, douglas, claimed, in, the, journal, of, pacific, history, that, a, strong, case, could, be, made, for, extending, oceania, to, at, least, taiwan, the, homeland, of, the, austronesian, language, family, whose, speakers, colonized, significant, parts, of, the, region, about, 6, 000, years, ago, for, political, reasons, taiwan, was, a, member, of, the, oceania, football, confederation, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, rather, than, the, asian, football, confederation, ian, todd, s, 1974, book, island, realm, a, pacific, panorama, also, defines, oceanic, latin, american, islands, as, making, up, a, spanish, language, segment, of, oceania, and, included, the, desventuradas, islands, easter, island, the, gal, pagos, islands, guadalupe, island, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, the, revillagigedo, islands, and, salas, y, g, mez, cocos, island, and, malpelo, island, were, not, explicitly, referenced, in, the, book, despite, being, areas, which, would, fall, within, this, range, all, other, islands, associated, with, latin, american, countries, were, excluded, as, they, are, continental, in, nature, unlike, guadalupe, island, and, the, revillagigedo, islands, both, situated, on, the, pacific, plate, and, the, oceanic, islands, situated, on, the, cocos, plate, and, nazca, plate, todd, defined, the, oceanic, bonin, islands, as, making, up, a, japanese, language, segment, of, oceania, and, excluded, the, main, japanese, archipelago, todd, further, included, the, aleutian, islands, in, his, definition, of, oceania, the, island, chain, borders, both, the, pacific, plate, and, the, north, american, plate, and, is, geologically, a, partially, submerged, volcanic, extension, of, the, aleutian, range, on, the, alaskan, mainland, he, did, not, include, the, volcanic, kuril, islands, and, ryukyu, islands, which, similarly, border, both, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, pacific, plate, nor, did, he, include, the, neighbouring, kodiak, archipelago, in, the, north, pacific, ocean, which, is, firmly, situated, on, the, north, american, plate, the, stockholm, journal, of, east, asian, studies, stated, in, 1996, that, oceania, was, defined, as, australia, and, an, ensemble, of, various, pacific, islands, particularly, those, in, the, central, and, south, pacific, never, those, in, the, extreme, north, for, example, the, aleutian, chain, in, the, pacific, ocean, handbook, 1945, author, eliot, grinnell, mears, claimed, it, is, customary, to, exclude, the, aleutians, of, the, north, pacific, the, american, coastal, islands, and, the, netherlands, east, indies, and, that, he, included, australia, and, new, zealand, in, oceania, for, scientific, reasons, australia, s, fauna, is, largely, continental, in, character, new, zealand, s, are, clearly, insular, and, neither, commonwealth, realm, has, close, ties, with, asia, in, his, 2002, book, oceania, an, introduction, to, the, cultures, and, identities, of, pacific, islanders, andrew, strathern, excluded, okinawa, and, the, rest, of, the, ryukyu, islands, from, his, definition, of, oceania, but, noted, that, the, islands, and, their, indigenous, inhabitants, show, many, parallels, with, pacific, island, societies, in, the, 2006, book, extinction, and, biogeography, of, tropical, pacific, birds, american, paleontologist, david, steadman, wrote, no, place, on, earth, is, as, perplexing, as, the, 25, 000, islands, that, make, oceania, steadman, viewed, oceania, as, encompassing, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, including, easter, island, and, hawaii, he, excluded, from, his, definition, the, larger, islands, of, new, guinea, and, new, zealand, and, argued, that, cocos, island, the, gal, pagos, islands, the, revillagigedo, islands, and, other, oceanic, islands, nearing, the, americas, were, not, part, of, oceania, due, to, their, biogeographical, affinities, with, that, area, and, lack, of, prehistoric, indigenous, populations, in, his, 2018, book, regionalism, in, south, pacific, chinese, author, yu, changsen, wrote, that, some, stress, a, narrow, vision, of, the, pacific, as, those, pacific, islands, excluding, australia, and, even, sometimes, new, zealand, adding, that, the, term, oceania, promotes, a, broader, concept, that, has, room, for, australia, and, new, zealand, american, marine, geologist, anthony, a, p, koppers, wrote, in, the, 2009, book, encyclopedia, of, islands, that, as, a, whole, the, islands, of, the, pacific, region, are, referred, to, as, oceania, the, tenth, continent, on, earth, inherent, to, their, remoteness, and, because, of, the, wide, variety, of, island, types, the, pacific, islands, have, developed, unique, social, biological, and, geological, characteristics, koppers, considered, oceania, to, encompass, the, entire, 25, 000, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, in, this, book, he, included, the, aleutian, islands, the, gal, pagos, islands, the, japanese, archipelago, the, kuril, islands, and, continental, islands, off, the, coast, of, the, americas, such, as, the, channel, islands, the, farallon, islands, and, vancouver, island, all, of, these, islands, lie, in, or, close, to, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, as, is, the, case, with, new, guinea, and, new, zealand, which, were, also, included, in, the, 2013, book, the, environments, of, the, poor, in, southeast, asia, east, asia, and, the, pacific, paul, bullen, critiqued, the, definition, of, oceania, in, encyclopedia, of, islands, and, wrote, that, since, koppers, included, areas, such, as, vancouver, island, it, is, not, clear, what, the, referents, of, pacific, region, oceania, or, pacific, islands, are, bullen, added, that, asia, europe, and, the, maritime, continent, are, not, literal, geographic, continents, the, asia, pacific, region, would, comprise, two, quasi, continents, the, pacific, would, not, refer, to, the, pacific, ocean, and, everything, in, it, e, g, the, philippines, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, of, world, place, names, 2017, by, john, everett, heath, states, that, oceania, is, a, collective, name, for, more, than, 10, 000, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, that, it, is, generally, accepted, that, indonesia, japan, the, philippines, taiwan, and, the, islands, north, of, japan, the, kurils, and, aleutians, are, excluded, in, his, 1993, book, a, new, oceania, rediscovering, our, sea, of, islands, new, guinea, born, fijian, scholar, epeli, hau, ofa, wrote, that, pacific, ocean, islands, from, japan, through, the, philippines, and, indonesia, which, are, adjacent, to, the, asian, mainland, do, not, have, oceanic, cultures, and, are, therefore, not, part, of, oceania, the, oxford, handbook, of, prehistoric, oceania, 2018, defined, oceania, as, only, covering, austronesian, speaking, islands, in, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, with, this, definition, including, new, guinea, and, new, zealand, other, austronesian, areas, such, as, indonesia, and, the, philippines, were, not, included, due, to, their, closer, cultural, proximity, to, mainland, asia, australia, was, also, not, included, as, it, was, settled, several, thousands, of, years, before, the, arrival, of, austronesian, speaking, peoples, in, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, the, book, stated, this, definition, of, oceania, might, seem, too, restrictive, why, not, include, australia, for, example, or, even, too, broad, for, what, does, highland, new, guinea, have, to, do, with, hawai, i, further, noting, that, a, few, other, islands, in, the, pacific, such, as, those, of, japan, or, the, channel, islands, off, the, southern, california, coast, are, not, typically, considered, oceania, as, the, indigenous, populations, of, these, places, do, not, share, a, common, ancestry, with, oceanic, groups, except, for, a, time, far, before, humans, sailed, pacific, waters, it, has, been, theorized, that, the, indigenous, j, mon, people, of, the, japanese, archipelago, are, related, to, austronesians, along, with, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, the, ryukyu, islands, some, also, theorize, that, indigenous, australians, are, related, to, the, ainu, people, who, are, the, original, inhabitants, of, japan, s, hokkaido, the, kuril, islands, and, the, southern, part, of, sakhalin, in, their, 2019, book, women, and, violence, global, lives, in, focus, kathleen, nadeau, and, sangita, rayamajhi, wrote, the, philippines, malaysia, brunei, and, most, of, indonesia, are, not, usually, considered, to, be, part, of, the, region, of, oceania, as, it, is, understood, today, these, regions, are, usually, considered, to, be, part, of, maritime, southeast, asia, although, these, regions, as, well, as, the, large, east, asian, islands, of, taiwan, hainan, and, the, japanese, archipelago, have, varying, degrees, of, cultural, connections, in, reptiles, and, amphibians, of, the, pacific, islands, a, comprehensive, guide, 2013, george, r, zug, claimed, that, a, standard, definition, of, oceania, includes, australia, papua, new, guinea, the, solomon, islands, new, caledonia, and, new, zealand, and, the, oceanic, islands, of, polynesia, micronesia, and, melanesia, he, went, on, to, write, that, his, preferred, definition, of, oceania, emphasis, islands, with, oceanic, geology, stating, that, oceanic, islands, are, islands, with, no, past, connections, to, a, continental, landmass, and, that, these, boundaries, encompass, the, hawaiian, and, bonin, islands, in, the, north, and, easter, island, in, the, south, and, the, palau, islands, in, the, west, to, the, gal, pagos, islands, in, the, east, australia, new, guinea, new, zealand, and, new, caledonia, which, is, geologically, associated, with, new, zealand, were, all, excluded, as, these, areas, are, descendants, of, the, ancient, pangaea, supercontinent, along, with, landmasses, such, as, the, americas, and, afro, eurasia, volcanic, islands, which, are, geologically, associated, with, continental, landmasses, such, as, the, aleutian, islands, japan, s, izu, islands, the, kuril, islands, the, ryukyu, islands, and, most, of, the, solomon, islands, were, also, excluded, from, his, definition, unlike, the, united, nations, the, world, factbook, defines, the, still, uninhabited, clipperton, island, as, being, a, discrete, political, entity, and, they, categorize, it, as, part, of, north, america, presumably, due, to, its, relative, proximity, situated, 1, 200, kilometres, off, mexico, on, the, pacific, plate, clipperton, is, not, politically, associated, with, the, americas, as, is, the, case, with, other, oceanic, islands, nearing, the, americas, having, had, almost, no, interaction, with, the, continent, throughout, its, history, from, the, early, 20th, century, to, 2007, the, island, was, administratively, part, of, french, polynesia, which, itself, was, known, as, french, oceania, up, until, 1957, in, terms, of, marine, fauna, clipperton, shares, similarities, with, areas, of, the, pacific, which, are, much, farther, removed, from, the, americas, scottish, author, robert, hope, moncrieff, considered, clipperton, to, be, the, easternmost, point, of, oceania, in, 1907, while, ian, todd, also, included, it, in, his, definition, of, oceania, in, island, realm, a, pacific, panorama, other, uninhabited, pacific, ocean, landmasses, have, been, explicitly, associated, with, oceania, including, the, highly, remote, baker, island, and, wake, island, now, administered, by, the, u, s, military, this, is, due, to, their, location, in, the, centre, of, the, pacific, their, biogeography, and, their, oceanic, geology, less, isolated, oceanic, islands, that, were, once, uninhabited, such, as, the, bonin, islands, the, gal, pagos, islands, and, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, have, since, been, sparsely, populated, by, citizens, of, their, political, administrators, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, micronesians, may, have, lived, on, the, bonin, islands, c, 2, 000, years, ago, but, they, were, uninhabited, at, the, time, of, european, discovery, in, the, 16th, century, depending, on, the, definition, new, zealand, could, be, part, of, polynesia, or, part, of, australasia, with, australia, new, zealand, was, originally, settled, by, the, polynesian, m,

polynesians, in, the, world, while, australia, has, the, third, largest, polynesian, population, consisting, entirely, of, immigrants, modern, day, indigenous, australians, are, loosely, related, to, melanesians, and, australia, maintains, political, influence, over, melanesia, which, is, mostly, located, on, the, same, tectonic, plate, despite, this, australia, is, rarely, seen, as, a, part, of, the, subregion, as, with, australia, and, new, zealand, melanesia, s, new, caledonia, has, a, significant, non, indigenous, european, population, numbering, around, 71, 000, conversely, new, caledonia, has, still, had, a, similar, history, to, the, rest, of, melanesia, and, their, french, speaking, europeans, make, up, only, 27, of, the, total, population, as, such, it, is, not, also, culturally, considered, a, part, of, the, predominantly, english, speaking, australasia, some, cultural, and, political, definitions, of, australasia, include, most, or, all, of, melanesia, due, to, its, geographical, proximity, to, australia, and, new, zealand, but, these, are, rare, australia, new, zealand, and, the, islands, of, melanesia, are, more, commonly, grouped, together, as, part, of, the, australasian, biogeographical, realm, papua, new, guinea, is, geographically, the, closest, country, to, australia, and, is, often, geologically, associated, with, australia, as, it, was, once, physiologically, connected, australia, s, indian, ocean, external, territories, of, christmas, island, and, cocos, keeling, islands, are, situated, within, the, bounds, of, the, australian, plate, and, have, been, geographically, associated, with, southeast, asia, due, to, their, proximity, to, western, indonesia, both, were, uninhabited, when, discovered, by, europeans, during, the, 17th, century, approximately, half, of, the, population, on, these, islands, are, european, australian, mainlanders, with, smaller, numbers, being, european, new, zealanders, while, the, other, half, are, immigrants, from, china, or, the, nearby, malay, archipelago, australia, s, indian, ocean, external, territory, heard, island, and, mcdonald, islands, lie, on, the, antarctic, plate, and, are, also, thought, of, as, being, in, antarctica, or, no, region, at, all, due, to, their, extreme, geographical, isolation, the, world, factbook, define, heard, island, and, mcdonald, islands, as, part, of, antarctica, while, placing, christmas, island, and, cocos, keeling, islands, as, the, westernmost, extent, of, oceania, norfolk, island, an, external, territory, of, australia, was, inhabited, in, prehistoric, times, by, either, melanesians, or, polynesians, and, is, geographically, adjacent, to, the, islands, of, melanesia, the, current, inhabitants, are, mostly, european, australians, and, the, un, categorize, it, as, being, in, the, australasia, subregion, the, 1982, edition, of, the, south, pacific, handbook, by, david, stanley, groups, australia, new, zealand, norfolk, island, and, hawai, i, together, under, an, anglonesia, category, this, is, in, spite, of, the, geographical, distance, separating, these, areas, from, hawai, i, which, technically, lies, in, the, north, pacific, the, 1985, edition, of, the, south, pacific, handbook, also, groups, the, gal, pagos, islands, as, being, in, polynesia, while, noting, that, they, are, not, culturally, a, part, of, the, subregion, the, islands, are, typically, grouped, with, others, in, the, southeastern, pacific, that, were, never, inhabited, by, polynesians, the, bonin, islands, are, in, the, same, biogeographical, realm, as, the, geographically, adjacent, micronesia, and, are, often, grouped, in, with, the, subregion, because, of, this, indigenous, australians, are, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, australian, continent, and, nearby, islands, who, migrated, from, africa, to, asia, c, 70, 000, years, ago, and, arrived, in, australia, c, 50, 000, years, ago, they, are, believed, to, be, among, the, earliest, human, migrations, out, of, africa, although, they, likely, migrated, to, australia, through, southeast, asia, they, are, not, demonstrably, related, to, any, known, asian, or, polynesian, population, there, is, evidence, of, genetic, and, linguistic, interchange, between, australians, in, the, far, north, and, the, austronesian, peoples, of, modern, day, new, guinea, and, the, islands, but, this, may, be, the, result, of, recent, trade, and, intermarriage, they, reached, tasmania, c, 40, 000, years, ago, by, migrating, across, a, land, bridge, from, the, mainland, that, existed, during, the, last, ice, age, it, is, believed, that, the, first, early, human, migration, to, australia, was, achieved, when, this, landmass, formed, part, of, the, sahul, continent, connected, to, the, island, of, new, guinea, via, a, land, bridge, the, torres, strait, islanders, are, indigenous, to, the, torres, strait, islands, which, are, at, the, northernmost, tip, of, queensland, near, papua, new, guinea, the, earliest, definite, human, remains, found, in, australia, are, that, of, mungo, man, which, have, been, dated, at, c, 40, 000, years, old, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, group, of, islands, now, named, melanesia, were, likely, the, ancestors, of, the, present, day, papuan, speaking, people, migrating, from, southeast, asia, they, appear, to, have, occupied, these, islands, as, far, east, as, the, main, islands, in, the, solomon, islands, archipelago, including, makira, and, possibly, the, smaller, islands, farther, to, the, east, particularly, along, the, north, coast, of, new, guinea, and, in, the, islands, north, and, east, of, new, guinea, the, austronesian, people, who, had, migrated, into, the, area, somewhat, more, than, 3, 000, years, ago, came, into, contact, with, these, pre, existing, populations, of, papuan, speaking, peoples, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, scholars, theorized, a, long, period, of, interaction, which, resulted, in, many, complex, changes, in, genetics, languages, and, culture, among, the, peoples, micronesia, began, to, be, settled, several, millennia, ago, although, there, are, competing, theories, about, the, origin, and, arrival, of, the, first, settlers, there, are, numerous, difficulties, with, conducting, archaeological, excavations, in, the, islands, due, to, their, size, settlement, patterns, and, storm, damage, as, a, result, much, evidence, is, based, on, linguistic, analysis, the, earliest, archaeological, traces, of, civilization, have, been, found, on, the, island, of, saipan, dated, to, 1500, bce, or, slightly, before, the, ancestors, of, the, micronesians, settled, there, over, 4, 000, years, ago, a, decentralized, chieftain, based, system, eventually, evolved, into, a, more, centralized, economic, and, religious, culture, centred, on, yap, and, pohnpei, the, prehistories, of, many, micronesian, islands, such, as, yap, are, not, known, very, well, the, first, people, of, the, northern, mariana, islands, navigated, to, the, islands, and, discovered, it, at, some, period, between, 4000, bce, to, 2000, bce, from, southeast, asia, they, became, known, as, the, chamorros, their, language, was, named, after, them, the, ancient, chamorro, left, a, number, of, megalithic, ruins, including, latte, stone, the, refaluwasch, or, carolinian, people, came, to, the, marianas, in, the, 1800s, from, the, caroline, islands, micronesian, colonists, gradually, settled, the, marshall, islands, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, e, with, inter, island, navigation, made, possible, using,

and, tracing, polynesian, languages, places, their, prehistoric, origins, in, the, malay, archipelago, and, ultimately, in, taiwan, between, c, 3000, and, 1000, bce, speakers, of, austronesian, languages, began, spreading, from, taiwan, into, island, southeast, asia, as, tribes, whose, natives, were, thought, to, have, arrived, through, south, china, c, 8, 000, years, ago, to, the, edges, of, western, micronesia, and, on, into, melanesia, in, the, archaeological, record, there, are, well, defined, traces, of, this, expansion, which, allow, the, path, it, took, to, be, followed, and, dated, with, some, certainty, it, is, thought, that, by, roughly, 1400, bce, lapita, peoples, so, named, after, their, pottery, tradition, appeared, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, of, north, west, melanesia, easter, islanders, claimed, that, a, chief, hotu, matu, a, discovered, the, island, in, one, or, two, large, canoes, with, his, wife, and, extended, family, they, are, believed, to, have,

dates, from, charcoal, that, appears, to, have, been, produced, during, forest, clearance, activities, moreover, a, recent, study, which, included, radiocarbon, dates, from, what, is, thought, to, be, very, early, material, suggests, that, the, island, was, discovered, and, settled, as, recently, as, 1200, oceania, was, first, explored, by, europeans, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, portuguese,
