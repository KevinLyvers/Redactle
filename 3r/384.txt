mount, everest, also, mount, sagarmatha, or, mount, qomolangma, is, earth, s, highest, mountain, above, sea, level, located, in, the, mahalangur, himal, sub, range, of, the, himalayas, the, china, nepal, border, runs, across, its, summit, point, its, elevation, snow, height, of, 8, 848, 86, m, 29, 031, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, was, most, recently, established, in, 2020, by, the, chinese, and, nepali, authorities, mount, everest, attracts, many, climbers, including, highly, experienced, mountaineers, there, are, two, main, climbing, routes, one, approaching, the, summit, from, the, southeast, in, nepal, known, as, the, standard, route, and, the, other, from, the, north, in, tibet, while, not, posing, substantial, technical, climbing, challenges, on, the, standard, route, everest, presents, dangers, such, as, altitude, sickness, weather, and, wind, as, well, as, hazards, from, avalanches, and, the, khumbu, icefall, as, of, may, 2024, 340, people, have, died, on, everest, over, 200, bodies, remain, on, the, mountain, and, have, not, been, removed, due, to, the, dangerous, conditions, climbers, typically, ascend, only, part, of, mount, everest, s, elevation, as, the, mountain, s, full, elevation, is, measured, from, the, geoid, which, approximates, sea, level, the, closest, sea, to, mount, everest, s, summit, is, the, bay, of, bengal, almost, 700, km, 430, mi, away, so, to, approximate, a, climb, of, the, entire, height, of, mount, everest, one, would, need, to, start, from, this, coastline, a, feat, accomplished, by, tim, macartney, snape, s, team, in, 1990, climbers, usually, begin, their, ascent, from, base, camps, above, 5, 000, m, 16, 404, ft, the, amount, of, elevation, climbed, from, below, these, camps, varies, on, the, tibetan, side, most, climbers, drive, directly, to, the, north, base, camp, on, the, nepalese, side, climbers, generally, fly, into, kathmandu, then, lukla, and, trek, to, the, south, base, camp, making, the, climb, from, lukla, to, the, summit, about, 6, 000, m, 19, 685, ft, in, elevation, gain, the, first, recorded, efforts, to, reach, everest, s, summit, were, made, by, british, mountaineers, as, nepal, did, not, allow, foreigners, to, enter, the, country, at, the, time, the, british, made, several, attempts, on, the, north, ridge, route, from, the, tibetan, side, after, the, first, reconnaissance, expedition, by, the, british, in, 1921, reached, 7, 000, m, 22, 970, ft, on, the, north, col, the, 1922, expedition, pushed, the, north, ridge, route, up, to, 8, 320, m, 27, 300, ft, marking, the, first, time, a, human, had, climbed, above, 8, 000, m, 26, 247, ft, the, 1924, expedition, resulted, in, one, of, the, greatest, mysteries, on, everest, to, this, day, george, mallory, and, andrew, irvine, made, a, final, summit, attempt, on, 8, june, but, never, returned, sparking, debate, as, to, whether, they, were, the, first, to, reach, the, top, tenzing, norgay, and, edmund, hillary, made, the, first, documented, ascent, of, everest, in, 1953, using, the, southeast, ridge, route, norgay, had, reached, 8, 595, m, 28, 199, ft, the, previous, year, as, a, member, of, the, 1952, swiss, expedition, the, chinese, mountaineering, team, of, wang, fuzhou, gonpo, and, qu, yinhua, made, the, first, reported, ascent, of, the, peak, from, the, north, ridge, on, 25, may, 1960, mount, everest, s, nepali, sanskrit, name, is, sagarm, th, iast, transcription, or, sagar, matha, lit, goddess, of, the, sky, which, means, the, head, in, the, great, blue, sky, being, derived, from, sagar, meaning, sky, and, m, th, meaning, head, the, tibetan, name, for, everest, is, qomolangma, lit, holy, mother, the, name, was, first, recorded, in, a, chinese, transcription, in, the, 1721, kangxi, atlas, issued, during, the, reign, of, qing, emperor, kangxi, it, first, appeared, in, the, west, in, 1733, as, tchoumour, lancma, on, a, map, prepared, by, the, french, geographer, d, anville, and, based, on, kangxi, atlas, the, tibetan, name, is, also, popularly, romanised, as, chomolungma, and, in, wylie, as, jo, mo, glang, ma, the, official, chinese, transcription, is, t, or, zh, m, l, ngm, f, ng, in, pinyin, while, other, chinese, names, have, been, used, historically, including, sh, ngm, f, ng, t, s, lit, holy, mother, peak, these, names, were, largely, phased, out, after, the, chinese, ministry, of, internal, affairs, issued, a, decree, to, adopt, a, sole, name, in, may, 1952, the, british, geographic, survey, of, 1849, attempted, to, preserve, local, names, when, possible, e, g, kangchenjunga, and, dhaulagiri, however, andrew, waugh, the, british, surveyor, general, of, india, claimed, that, he, could, not, find, a, commonly, used, local, name, and, that, his, search, for, one, had, been, hampered, by, the, nepalese, and, tibetan, policy, of, exclusion, of, foreigners, waugh, argued, that, because, there, were, many, local, names, it, would, be, difficult, to, favour, one, name, over, all, others, he, therefore, decided, that, peak, xv, should, be, named, after, british, surveyor, sir, george, everest, his, predecessor, as, surveyor, general, of, india, everest, himself, opposed, the, honor, and, told, the, royal, geographical, society, in, 1857, that, everest, could, neither, be, written, in, hindi, nor, pronounced, by, the, native, of, india, despite, everest, s, objections, waugh, s, proposed, name, prevailed, and, the, royal, geographical, society, officially, adopted, the, name, mount, everest, in, 1865, the, modern, pronunciation, of, everest, v, r, s, t, is, different, from, sir, george, s, pronunciation, of, his, surname, i, v, r, s, t, eev, rist, in, the, late, 19th, century, many, european, cartographers, incorrectly, believed, that, a, native, name, for, the, mountain, was, gaurishankar, a, mountain, between, kathmandu, and, everest, in, 1802, the, british, began, the, great, trigonometrical, survey, of, india, to, fix, the, locations, heights, and, names, of, the, world, s, highest, mountains, starting, in, southern, india, the, survey, teams, moved, northward, using, giant, theodolites, each, weighing, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, and, requiring, 12, men, to, carry, to, measure, heights, as, accurately, as, possible, they, reached, the, himalayan, foothills, by, the, 1830s, but, nepal, was, unwilling, to, allow, the, british, to, enter, the, country, due, to, suspicions, of, their, intentions, several, requests, by, the, surveyors, to, enter, nepal, were, denied, the, british, were, forced, to, continue, their, observations, from, terai, a, region, south, of, nepal, which, is, parallel, to, the, himalayas, conditions, in, terai, were, difficult, because, of, torrential, rains, and, malaria, three, survey, officers, died, from, malaria, while, two, others, had, to, retire, because, of, failing, health, nonetheless, in, 1847, the, british, continued, the, survey, and, began, detailed, observations, of, the, himalayan, peaks, from, observation, stations, up, to, 240, km, 150, mi, distant, weather, restricted, work, to, the, last, three, months, of, the, year, in, november, 1847, andrew, scott, waugh, the, british, surveyor, general, of, india, made, several, observations, from, the, sawajpore, station, at, the, east, end, of, the, himalayas, kangchenjunga, was, then, considered, the, highest, peak, in, the, world, and, with, interest, he, noted, a, peak, beyond, it, about, 230, km, 140, mi, away, john, armstrong, one, of, waugh, s, subordinates, also, saw, the, peak, from, a, site, farther, west, and, called, it, peak, b, waugh, would, later, write, that, the, observations, indicated, that, peak, b, was, higher, than, kangchenjunga, but, closer, observations, were, required, for, verification, the, following, year, waugh, sent, a, survey, official, back, to, terai, to, make, closer, observations, of, peak, b, but, clouds, thwarted, his, attempts, in, 1849, waugh, dispatched, james, nicolson, to, the, area, who, made, two, observations, from, jirol, 190, km, 120, mi, away, nicolson, then, took, the, largest, theodolite, and, headed, east, obtaining, over, 30, observations, from, five, different, locations, with, the, closest, being, 174, km, 108, mi, from, the, peak, nicolson, retreated, to, patna, on, the, ganges, to, perform, the, necessary, calculations, based, on, his, observations, his, raw, data, gave, an, average, height, of, 9, 200, m, 30, 200, ft, for, peak, b, but, this, did, not, consider, light, refraction, which, distorts, heights, however, the, number, clearly, indicated, that, peak, b, was, higher, than, kangchenjunga, nicolson, contracted, malaria, and, was, forced, to, return, home, without, finishing, his, calculations, michael, hennessy, one, of, waugh, s, assistants, had, begun, designating, peaks, based, on, roman, numerals, with, kangchenjunga, named, peak, ix, peak, b, now, became, known, as, peak, xv, in, 1852, stationed, at, the, survey, headquarters, in, dehradun, radhanath, sikdar, an, indian, mathematician, and, surveyor, from, bengal, was, the, first, to, identify, everest, as, the, world, s, highest, peak, using, trigonometric, calculations, based, on, nicolson, s, measurements, an, official, announcement, that, peak, xv, was, the, highest, was, delayed, for, several, years, as, the, calculations, were, repeatedly, verified, waugh, began, work, on, nicolson, s, data, in, 1854, and, along, with, his, staff, spent, almost, two, years, working, on, the, numbers, having, to, deal, with, the, problems, of, light, refraction, barometric, pressure, and, temperature, over, the, vast, distances, of, the, observations, finally, in, march, 1856, he, announced, his, findings, in, a, letter, to, his, deputy, in, calcutta, kangchenjunga, was, declared, to, be, 8, 582, m, 28, 156, ft, while, peak, xv, was, given, the, height, of, 8, 840, m, 29, 002, ft, waugh, concluded, that, peak, xv, was, most, probably, the, highest, in, the, world, peak, xv, measured, in, feet, was, calculated, to, be, exactly, 29, 000, ft, 8, 839, 2, m, high, but, was, publicly, declared, to, be, 29, 002, ft, 8, 839, 8, m, in, order, to, avoid, the, impression, that, an, exact, height, of, 29, 000, feet, 8, 839, 2, m, was, nothing, more, than, a, rounded, estimate, waugh, is, sometimes, playfully, credited, with, being, the, first, person, to, put, two, feet, on, top, of, mount, everest, in, 1856, andrew, waugh, announced, everest, then, known, as, peak, xv, as, 8, 840, m, 29, 002, ft, high, after, several, years, of, calculations, based, on, observations, made, by, the, great, trigonometrical, survey, from, 1952, to, 1954, the, survey, of, india, using, triangulation, methods, determined, that, the, height, of, everest, was, 8, 847, 73, m, 29, 028, ft, in, 1975, it, was, subsequently, reaffirmed, by, a, chinese, measurement, of, 8, 848, 13, m, 29, 029, 30, ft, in, both, cases, the, snow, cap, not, the, rock, head, was, measured, the, 8, 848, m, 29, 029, ft, height, given, was, officially, recognised, by, nepal, and, china, nepal, planned, a, new, survey, in, 2019, to, determine, if, the, april, 2015, nepal, earthquake, affected, the, height, of, the, mountain, in, may, 1999, an, american, everest, expedition, directed, by, bradford, washburn, anchored, a, gps, unit, into, the, highest, bedrock, a, rock, head, elevation, of, 8, 850, m, 29, 035, ft, and, a, snow, ice, elevation, 1, m, 3, ft, higher, were, obtained, via, this, device, although, as, of, 2001, it, has, not, been, officially, recognised, by, nepal, this, figure, is, widely, quoted, geoid, uncertainty, casts, doubt, upon, the, accuracy, claimed, by, both, the, 1999, and, 2005, see, 21st, century, surveys, surveys, in, 1955, a, detailed, photogrammetric, map, at, a, scale, of, 1, 50, 000, of, the, khumbu, region, including, the, south, side, of, mount, everest, was, made, by, erwin, schneider, as, part, of, the, 1955, international, himalayan, expedition, which, also, attempted, lhotse, in, the, late, 1980s, an, even, more, detailed, topographic, map, of, the, everest, area, was, made, under, the, direction, of, bradford, washburn, using, extensive, aerial, photography, on, 9, october, 2005, after, several, months, of, measurement, and, calculation, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, and, state, bureau, of, surveying, and, mapping, announced, the, height, of, everest, as, 8, 844, 43, m, 29, 017, 16, ft, with, accuracy, of, 0, 21, m, 8, 3, in, claiming, it, was, the, most, accurate, and, precise, measurement, to, date, this, height, is, based, on, the, highest, point, of, rock, and, not, the, snow, and, ice, covering, it, the, chinese, team, measured, a, snow, ice, depth, of, 3, 5, m, 11, ft, which, is, in, agreement, with, a, net, elevation, of, 8, 848, m, 29, 029, ft, an, argument, arose, between, china, and, nepal, as, to, whether, the, official, height, should, be, the, rock, height, 8, 844, m, china, or, the, snow, height, 8, 848, m, nepal, in, 2010, both, sides, agreed, that, the, height, of, everest, is, 8, 848, m, and, nepal, recognises, china, s, claim, that, the, rock, height, of, everest, is, 8, 844, m, on, 8, december, 2020, it, was, jointly, announced, by, the, two, countries, that, the, new, official, height, is, 8, 848, 86, metres, 29, 031, 7, ft, it, is, thought, that, the, plate, tectonics, of, the, main, himalayan, thrust, and, related, faults, which, form, the, convergent, boundary, between, the, eurasian, plate, and, indian, plate, are, adding, to, the, height, and, moving, the, summit, northeastwards, two, accounts, suggest, the, rates, of, change, are, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, per, year, vertically, and, 3, to, 6, mm, 0, 12, to, 0, 24, in, per, year, horizontally, but, another, account, mentions, more, lateral, movement, 27, mm, or, 1, 1, in, and, even, shrinkage, has, been, suggested, the, summit, of, everest, is, the, point, at, which, earth, s, surface, reaches, the, greatest, distance, above, sea, level, several, other, mountains, are, sometimes, claimed, to, be, the, tallest, mountains, on, earth, mauna, kea, in, hawaii, is, tallest, when, measured, from, its, base, it, rises, over, 10, 200, m, 33, 464, 6, ft, from, its, base, on, the, mid, ocean, floor, but, only, attains, 4, 205, m, 13, 796, ft, above, sea, level, by, the, same, measure, of, base, to, summit, denali, in, alaska, formerly, known, as, mount, mckinley, is, taller, than, everest, as, well, despite, its, height, above, sea, level, of, only, 6, 190, m, 20, 308, ft, denali, sits, atop, a, sloping, plain, with, elevations, from, 300, to, 900, m, 980, to, 2, 950, ft, yielding, a, height, above, base, in, the, range, of, 5, 300, to, 5, 900, m, 17, 400, to, 19, 400, ft, a, commonly, quoted, figure, is, 5, 600, m, 18, 400, ft, by, comparison, reasonable, base, elevations, for, everest, range, from, 4, 200, m, 13, 800, ft, on, the, south, side, to, 5, 200, m, 17, 100, ft, on, the, tibetan, plateau, yielding, a, height, above, base, in, the, range, of, 3, 650, to, 4, 650, m, 11, 980, to, 15, 260, ft, the, summit, of, chimborazo, in, ecuador, is, 2, 168, m, 7, 113, ft, farther, from, earth, s, centre, 6, 384, 4, km, 3, 967, 1, mi, than, that, of, everest, 6, 382, 3, km, 3, 965, 8, mi, because, the, earth, bulges, at, the, equator, this, is, despite, chimborazo, having, a, peak, of, 6, 268, m, 20, 564, 3, ft, above, sea, level, versus, mount, everest, s, 8, 848, m, 29, 028, 9, ft, nearby, peaks, include, lhotse, 8, 516, m, 27, 940, ft, nuptse, 7, 855, m, 25, 771, ft, and, changtse, 7, 580, m, 24, 870, ft, among, others, another, nearby, peak, is, khumbutse, and, many, of, the, highest, mountains, in, the, world, are, near, mount, everest, on, the, southwest, side, a, major, feature, in, the, lower, areas, is, the, khumbu, icefall, and, glacier, an, obstacle, to, climbers, on, those, routes, but, also, to, the, base, camps, geologists, have, subdivided, the, rocks, comprising, mount, everest, into, three, units, called, formations, each, formation, is, separated, from, the, other, by, low, angle, faults, called, detachments, along, which, they, have, been, thrust, southward, over, each, other, from, the, summit, of, mount, everest, to, its, base, these, rock, units, are, the, qomolangma, formation, the, north, col, formation, and, the, rongbuk, formation, the, qomolangma, formation, also, known, as, the, jolmo, lungama, formation, runs, from, the, summit, to, the, top, of, the, yellow, band, about, 8, 600, m, 28, 200, ft, above, sea, level, it, consists, of, greyish, to, dark, grey, or, white, parallel, laminated, and, bedded, ordovician, limestone, interlayered, with, subordinate, beds, of, recrystallised, dolomite, with, argillaceous, laminae, and, siltstone, gansser, first, reported, finding, microscopic, fragments, of, crinoids, in, this, limestone, later, petrographic, analysis, of, samples, of, the, limestone, from, near, the, summit, revealed, them, to, be, composed, of, carbonate, pellets, and, finely, fragmented, remains, of, trilobites, crinoids, and, ostracods, other, samples, were, so, badly, sheared, and, recrystallised, that, their, original, constituents, could, not, be, determined, a, thick, white, weathering, thrombolite, bed, that, is, 60, m, 200, ft, thick, comprises, the, foot, of, the, third, step, and, base, of, the, summit, pyramid, of, everest, this, bed, which, crops, out, starting, about, 70, m, 230, ft, below, the, summit, of, mount, everest, consists, of, sediments, trapped, bound, and, cemented, by, the, biofilms, of, micro, organisms, especially, cyanobacteria, in, shallow, marine, waters, the, qomolangma, formation, is, broken, up, by, several, high, angle, faults, that, terminate, at, the, low, angle, normal, fault, the, qomolangma, detachment, this, detachment, separates, it, from, the, underlying, yellow, band, the, lower, five, metres, of, the, qomolangma, formation, overlying, this, detachment, are, very, highly, deformed, the, bulk, of, mount, everest, between, 7, 000, and, 8, 600, m, 23, 000, and, 28, 200, ft, consists, of, the, north, col, formation, of, which, the, yellow, band, forms, the, upper, part, between, 8, 200, to, 8, 600, m, 26, 900, to, 28, 200, ft, the, yellow, band, consists, of, intercalated, beds, of, middle, cambrian, diopside, epidote, bearing, marble, which, weathers, a, distinctive, yellowish, brown, and, muscovite, biotite, phyllite, and, semischist, petrographic, analysis, of, marble, collected, from, about, 8, 300, m, 27, 200, ft, found, it, to, consist, as, much, as, five, per, cent, of, the, ghosts, of, recrystallised, crinoid, ossicles, the, upper, five, metres, of, the, yellow, band, lying, adjacent, to, the, qomolangma, detachment, is, badly, deformed, a, 5, 40, cm, 2, 0, 15, 7, in, thick, fault, breccia, separates, it, from, the, overlying, qomolangma, formation, the, remainder, of, the, north, col, formation, exposed, between, 7, 000, to, 8, 200, m, 23, 000, to, 26, 900, ft, on, mount, everest, consists, of, interlayered, and, deformed, schist, phyllite, and, minor, marble, between, 7, 600, and, 8, 200, m, 24, 900, and, 26, 900, ft, the, north, col, formation, consists, chiefly, of, biotite, quartz, phyllite, and, chlorite, biotite, phyllite, intercalated, with, minor, amounts, of, biotite, sericite, quartz, schist, between, 7, 000, and, 7, 600, m, 23, 000, and, 24, 900, ft, the, lower, part, of, the, north, col, formation, consists, of, biotite, quartz, schist, intercalated, with, epidote, quartz, schist, biotite, calcite, quartz, schist, and, thin, layers, of, quartzose, marble, these, metamorphic, rocks, appear, to, be, the, result, of, the, metamorphism, of, middle, to, early, cambrian, deep, sea, flysch, composed, of, interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey, sandstone, calcareous, sandstone, graywacke, and, sandy, limestone, the, base, of, the, north, col, formation, is, a, regional, low, angle, normal, fault, called, the, lhotse, detachment, below, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, the, rongbuk, formation, underlies, the, north, col, formation, and, forms, the, base, of, mount, everest, it, consists, of, sillimanite, k, feldspar, grade, schist, and, gneiss, intruded, by, numerous, sills, and, dikes, of, leucogranite, ranging, in, thickness, from, 1, cm, to, 1, 500, m, 0, 4, in, to, 4, 900, ft, these, leucogranites, are, part, of, a, belt, of, late, oligocene, miocene, intrusive, rocks, known, as, the, higher, himalayan, leucogranite, they, formed, as, the, result, of, partial, melting, of, paleoproterozoic, to, ordovician, high, grade, metasedimentary, rocks, of, the, higher, himalayan, sequence, about, 20, to, 24, million, years, ago, during, the, subduction, of, the, indian, plate, mount, everest, consists, of, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rocks, that, have, been, faulted, southward, over, continental, crust, composed, of, archean, granulites, of, the, indian, plate, during, the, cenozoic, collision, of, india, with, asia, current, interpretations, argue, that, the, qomolangma, and, north, col, formations, consist, of, marine, sediments, that, accumulated, within, the, continental, shelf, of, the, northern, passive, continental, margin, of, india, before, it, collided, with, asia, the, cenozoic, collision, of, india, with, asia, subsequently, deformed, and, metamorphosed, these, strata, as, it, thrust, them, southward, and, upward, the, rongbuk, formation, consists, of, a, sequence, of, high, grade, metamorphic, and, granitic, rocks, that, were, derived, from, the, alteration, of, high, grade, metasedimentary, rocks, during, the, collision, of, india, with, asia, these, rocks, were, thrust, downward, and, to, the, north, as, they, were, overridden, by, other, strata, heated, metamorphosed, and, partially, melted, at, depths, of, over, 15, to, 20, kilometres, 9, 3, to, 12,

region, according, to, the, study, based, on, satellite, data, from, 1993, to, 2018, vegetation, is, expanding, in, the, everest, region, researchers, have, found, plants, in, areas, that, were, previously, deemed, bare, a, minute, black, jumping, spider, of, the, genus, euophrys, has, been, found, at, elevations, as, high, as, 6, 700, metres, 22, 000, ft, possibly, making, it, the, highest, confirmed, non, microscopic, permanent, resident, on, earth, another, euophrys, species, e, everestensis, has, been, found, at, 5, 030, metres, 16, 500, ft, and, may, feed, on, insects, that, have, been, blown, there, by, the, wind, there, is, a, high, likelihood, of, microscopic, life, at, even, higher, altitudes, the, bar, headed, goose, migrates, over, the, himalayas, and, have, been, seen, flying, at, the, higher, altitudes, of, the, mountain, in, 1953, george, lowe, part, of, the, expedition, of, tenzing, and, hillary, said, that, he, saw, bar, headed, geese, flying, over, everest, s, summit, another, bird, species, the, chough, have, been, spotted, as, high, as, the, south, col, at, 7, 920, metres, 25, 980, ft, and, yellow, billed, choughs, have, been, seen, as, high, as, 7, 900,

ice, cap, climate, k, ppen, ef, with, all, months, averaging, well, below, freezing, the, base, camp, for, everest, expeditions, based, out, of, nepal, is, located, by, khumbu, glacier, which, is, rapidly, thinning, and, destabilizing, due, to, climate, change, making, it, unsafe, for, climbers, as, recommended, by, the, committee, formed, by, nepal, s, government, to, facilitate, and, monitor, mountaineering, in, the, everest, region, taranath, adhikari, the, director, general, of, nepal, s, tourism, department, said, they, have, plans, to, move, the, base, camp, to, a, lower, altitude, this, would, mean, a, longer, distance, for, climbers, between, the, base, camp, and, camp, 1, however, the, present, base, camp, is, still, useful, and, could, still, serve, its, purpose, for, three, to, four, years, the, move, may, happen, by, 2024, per, officials, in, 2008, a, new, weather, station, at, about, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, elevation, went, online, the, project, was, orchestrated, by,

station, the, highest, weather, station, on, the, planet, located, at, about, 8, 430, meters, 27, 657, feet, above, sea, level, set, up, by, climate, scientists, tom, matthews, and, baker, perry, in, 2019, this, station, is, positioned, just, below, the, summit, of, everest, which, is, the, highest, point, on, earth, as, of, january, 20, 2020, the, balcony, station, ceased, transmitting, data, because, mount, everest, is, the, highest, mountain, in, the, world, it, has, attracted, considerable, attention, and, climbing, attempts, whether, the, mountain, was, climbed, in, ancient, times, is, unknown, it, may, have, been, climbed, in, 1924, although, this, has, never, been, confirmed, as, neither, of, the, men, making, the, attempt, returned, several, climbing, routes, have, been, established, over, several, decades, of, climbing, expeditions, to, the, mountain, everest, s, summit, is, first, known, to, have, been, reached, by, a, human, in, 1953, and, interest, from, climbers, increased, thereafter, despite, the, effort, and, attention, poured, into, expeditions, only, about, 200, people, had, summited, by, 1987, everest, remained, a, difficult, climb, for, decades, even, for, serious, attempts, by, professional, climbers, and, large, national, expeditions, which, were, the, norm, until, the, commercial, era, began, in, the, 1990s, by, march, 2012, everest, had, been, climbed, 5, 656, times, with, 223, deaths, by, 2013, the, himalayan, database, recorded, 6, 871, summits, by, 4, 042, different, people, although, lower, mountains, have, longer, or, steeper, climbs, everest, is, so, high, the, jet, stream, can, hit, it, climbers, can, be, faced, with, winds, beyond, 320, km, h, 200, mph, when, the, weather, shifts, at, certain, times, of, the, year, the, jet, stream, shifts, north, providing, periods, of, relative, calm, at, the, mountain, other, dangers, include, blizzards, and, avalanches, in, 1885, clinton, thomas, dent, president, of, the, alpine, club, suggested, that, climbing, mount, everest, was, possible, in, his, book, above, the, snow, line, the, northern, approach, to, the, mountain, was, discovered, by, george, mallory, and, guy, bullock, on, the, initial, 1921, british, reconnaissance, expedition, it, was, an, exploratory, expedition, not, equipped, for, a, serious, attempt, to, climb, the, mountain, with, mallory, leading, and, thus, becoming, the, first, european, to, set, foot, on, everest, s, flanks, they, climbed, the, north, col, to, an, altitude, of, 7, 005, metres, 22, 982, ft, from, there, mallory, espied, a, route, to, the, top, but, the, party, was, unprepared, to, climb, any, further, and, descended, the, british, returned, for, a, 1922, expedition, george, finch, climbed, using, oxygen, for, the, first, time, he, ascended, at, a, remarkable, speed, 290, metres, 951, ft, per, hour, and, reached, an, altitude, of, 8, 320, m, 27, 300, ft, the, first, time, a, human, reported, to, climb, higher, than, 8, 000, m, mallory, and, col, felix, norton, made, a, second, unsuccessful, attempt, the, next, expedition, was, in, 1924, the, initial, attempt, by, mallory, and, geoffrey, bruce, was, aborted, when, weather, conditions, prevented, the, establishment, of, camp, vi, the, next, attempt, was, that, of, norton, and, somervell, who, climbed, without, oxygen, and, in, perfect, weather, traversing, the, north, face, into, the, great, couloir, norton, managed, to, reach, 8, 550, m, 28, 050, ft, though, he, ascended, only, 30, m, 98, ft, or, so, in, the, last, hour, mallory, rustled, up, oxygen, equipment, for, a, last, ditch, effort, he, chose, young, andrew, irvine, as, his, partner, on, 8, june, 1924, george, mallory, and, andrew, irvine, made, an, attempt, on, the, summit, via, the, north, col, north, ridge, northeast, ridge, route, from, which, they, never, returned, on, 1, may, 1999, the, mallory, and, irvine, research, expedition, found, mallory, s, body, on, the, north, face, in, a, snow, basin, below, and, to, the, west, of, the, traditional, site, of, camp, vi, controversy, has, raged, in, the, mountaineering, community, whether, one, or, both, of, them, reached, the, summit, 29, years, before, the, confirmed, ascent, and, safe, descent, of, everest, by, sir, edmund, hillary, and, tenzing, norgay, in, 1953, in, 1933, lady, houston, a, british, millionairess, funded, the, houston, everest, flight, of, 1933, which, saw, a, formation, of, two, aeroplanes, led, by, the, marquess, of, clydesdale, fly, over, the, everest, summit, early, expeditions, such, as, charles, bruce, s, in, the, 1920s, and, hugh, ruttledge, s, two, unsuccessful, attempts, in, 1933, and, 1936, tried, to, ascend, the, mountain, from, tibet, via, the, north, face, access, was, closed, from, the, north, to, western, expeditions, in, 1950, after, china, took, control, of, tibet, in, 1950, bill, tilman, and, a, small, party, which, included, charles, houston, oscar, houston, and, betsy, cowles, undertook, an, exploratory, expedition, to, everest, through, nepal, along, the, route, which, has, now, become, the, standard, approach, to, everest, from, the, south, the, 1952, swiss, mount, everest, expedition, led, by, edouard, wyss, dunant, was, granted, permission, to, attempt, a, climb, from, nepal, it, established, a, route, through, the, khumbu, icefall, and, ascended, to, the, south, col, at, an, elevation, of, 7, 986, m, 26, 201, ft, raymond, lambert, and, sherpa, tenzing, norgay, were, able, to, reach, an, elevation, of, about, 8, 595, m, 28, 199, ft, on, the, southeast, ridge, setting, a, new, climbing, altitude, record, tenzing, s, experience, was, useful, when, he, was, hired, to, be, part, of, the, british, expedition, in, 1953, the, swiss, decided, to, make, another, post, monsoon, attempt, in, the, autumn, they, made, it, to, the, south, col, but, were, driven, back, by, winter, winds, and, severe, cold, in, 1953, a, ninth, british, expedition, led, by, john, hunt, returned, to, nepal, hunt, selected, two, climbing, pairs, to, attempt, to, reach, the, summit, the, first, pair, tom, bourdillon, and, charles, evans, came, within, 100, m, 330, ft, of, the, summit, on, 26, may, 1953, but, turned, back, after, running, into, oxygen, problems, as, planned, their, work, in, route, finding, and, breaking, trail, and, their, oxygen, caches, were, of, great, aid, to, the, following, pair, two, days, later, the, expedition, made, its, second, assault, on, the, summit, with, the, second, climbing, pair, the, new, zealander, edmund, hillary, and, tenzing, norgay, a, nepali, sherpa, climber, they, reached, the, summit, at, 11, 30, am, local, time, on, 29, may, 1953, via, the, south, col, route, at, the, time, both, acknowledged, it, as, a, team, effort, by, the, whole, expedition, but, tenzing, revealed, a, few, years, later, that, hillary, had, put, his, foot, on, the, summit, first, they, paused, at, the, summit, to, take, photographs, and, buried, a, few, sweets, and, a, small, cross, in, the, snow, before, descending, on, 23, may, 1956, ernst, schmied, and, juerg, marmet, ascended, this, was, followed, by, d, lf, reist, and, hans, rudolf, von, gunten, on, 24, may, 1957, wang, fuzhou, gonpo, and, qu, yinhua, of, china, made, the, first, reported, ascent, of, the, peak, from, the, north, ridge, on, 25, may, 1960, the, first, american, to, climb, everest, jim, whittaker, joined, by, nawang, gombu, reached, the, summit, on, 1, may, 1963, on, the, american, mount, everest, expedition, and, on, 22, may, on, the, same, expedition, tom, hornbein, and, willi, unsoeld, were, the, first, the, traverse, the, mountain, by, climbing, via, the, north, face, and, descending, via, the, south, col, in, 1970, japanese, mountaineers, conducted, a, major, expedition, the, centrepiece, was, a, large, siege, style, expedition, led, by, saburo, matsukata, working, on, finding, a, new, route, up, the, southwest, face, another, element, of, the, expedition, was, an, attempt, to, ski, mount, everest, despite, a, staff, of, over, one, hundred, people, and, a, decade, of, planning, work, the, expedition, suffered, eight, deaths, and, failed, to, summit, via, the, planned, routes, however, japanese, expeditions, did, enjoy, some, successes, for, example, yuichiro, miura, became, the, first, man, to, ski, down, everest, from, the, south, col, he, descended, nearly, 1, 300, vertical, metres, 4, 200, ft, from, the, south, col, before, falling, with, extreme, injuries, another, success, was, an, expedition, that, put, four, on, the, summit, via, the, south, col, route, miura, s, exploits, became, the, subject, of, film, and, he, went, on, to, become, the, oldest, person, to, summit, mount, everest, in, 2003, at, age, 70, and, again, in, 2013, at, the, age, of, 80, in, 1975, junko, tabei, became, the, first, woman, to, summit, mount, everest, the, 1975, british, mount, everest, southwest, face, expedition, led, and, organised, by, chris, bonington, made, the, first, ascent, of, the, south, west, face, of, everest, from, the, western, cwm, the, 1976, british, and, nepalese,

started, a, new, decade, of, winter, himalaism, which, became, a, polish, specialisation, after, 1980, poles, did, ten, first, winter, ascents, on, 8000, metre, peaks, which, earned, polish, climbers, a, reputation, of, ice, warriors, in, may, 1989, polish, climbers, under, the, leadership, of, eugeniusz, chrobak, organised, an, international, expedition, to, mount, everest, on, a, difficult, western, ridge, ten, poles, and, nine, foreigners, participated, but, ultimately, only, the, poles, remained, in, the, attempt, for, the, summit, on, 24, may, chrobak, and, andrzej, marciniak, starting, from, camp, v, at, 8, 200, m, overcame, the, ridge, and, reached, the, summit, but, on, 27, may, during, an, avalanche, from, the, side, of, khumbutse, near, the, lho, la, pass, four,

rescue, expedition, they, took, part, inter, alia, reinhold, messner, elizabeth, hawley, carlos, carsolio, and, the, us, consul, on, 10, and, 11, may, 1996, eight, climbers, died, after, several, guided, expeditions, were, caught, in, a, blizzard, high, up, on, the, mountain, during, a, summit, attempt, on, 10, may, during, the, 1996, season, 15, people, died, while, climbing, on, mount, everest, these, were, the, highest, death, tolls, for, a, single, weather, event, and, for, a, single, season, until, the, sixteen, deaths, in, the, 2014, mount, everest, avalanche, the, guiding, disaster, gained, wide, publicity, and, raised, questions, about, the, commercialisation, of, climbing, and, the, safety, of, guiding, clients, on, mount, everest, journalist, jon, krakauer, on, assignment, from, outside, magazine, was, in, one, of, the, affected, guided, parties, and, afterward, published, the, bestseller, into, thin, air, which, related, his, experience, krakauer, was, critical, of, guide, anatoli, boukreev, in, his, recollection, of, the, expedition, a, year, later, boukreev, co, authored, the, climb, in, part, as, a, rebuttal, of, krakauer, s, portrayal, the, dispute, sparked, a, debate, within, the, climbing, community, boukreev, was, later, awarded, the, american, alpine, club, s, david, sowles, award, for, his, rescue, efforts, on, the, expedition, in, may, 2004, physicist, kent, moore, and, surgeon, john, l, semple, both, researchers, from, the, university, of, toronto, told, new, scientist, magazine, that, an, analysis, of, weather, conditions,

snow, blindness, when, he, arrived, at, camp, 4, fellow, climbers, considered, his, condition, terminal, and, left, him, in, a, tent, to, die, overnight, weathers, was, lowered, to, camp, 2, and, eventually, a, helicopter, rescue, was, organised, thanks, to, the, nepali, army, the, storm, s, impact, on, climbers, on, the, north, ridge, of, everest, where, several, climbers, also, died, was, detailed, in, a, first, hand, account, by, british, filmmaker, and, writer, matt, dickinson, in, his, book, the, other, side, of, everest, sixteen, year, old, mark, pfetzer, was, on, the, climb, and, wrote, about, it, in, his, account, within, reach, my, everest, story, the, 2015, feature, film, everest, directed, by, baltasar, korm, kur, is, based, on, the, events, of, this, guiding, disaster, in, 2006, 12, people, died, one, death, in, particular, see, below, triggered, an, international, debate, and, years, of, discussion, about, climbing, ethics, the, season, was, also, remembered, for, the, rescue, of, lincoln, hall, who, had, been, left, by, his, climbing, team, and, declared, dead, but, was, later, discovered, alive, and, survived, being, helped, off, the, mountain, there, was, an, international, controversy, about, the, death, of, a, solo, british, climber, david, sharp, who, attempted, to, climb, mount, everest, in, 2006, but, died, in, his, attempt, the, story, broke, out, of, the, mountaineering, community, into, popular, media, with, a, series, of, interviews, allegations, and, critiques, the, question, was, whether, climbers, that, season, had, left, a, man, to, die, and, whether, he, could, have, been, saved, he, was, said, to, have, attempted, to, summit, mount, everest, by, himself, with, no, sherpa, or, guide, and, fewer, oxygen, bottles, than, considered, normal, he, went, with, a, low, budget, nepali, guide, firm, that, only, provides, support, up, to, base, camp, after, which, climbers, go, as, a, loose, group, offering, a, high, degree, of, independence, the, manager, at, sharp, s, guide, support, said, sharp, did, not, take, enough, oxygen, for, his, summit, attempt, and, did, not, have, a, sherpa, guide, it, is, less, clear, who, knew, sharp, was, in, trouble, and, if, they, did, know, whether, they, were, qualified, or, capable, of, helping, him, double, amputee, climber, mark, inglis, said, in, an, interview, that, his, climbing, party, and, many, others, had, passed, sharp, on, 15, may, sheltering, under, a, rock, overhang, 450, metres, 1, 480, ft, below, the, summit, without, attempting, a, rescue, inglis, said, 40, people, had, passed, by, sharp, but, he, might, have, been, overlooked, as, climbers, assumed, sharp, was, the, corpse, nicknamed, green, boots, but, inglis, was, not, aware, that, turkish, climbers, had, tried, to, help, sharp, despite, being, in, the, process, of, helping, an, injured, woman, down, a, turkish, woman, bur, ak, po, an, there, has, also, been, some, discussion, about, himex, in, the, commentary, on, inglis, and, sharp, in, regards, to, inglis, s, initial, comments, he, later, revised, certain, details, because, he, had, been, interviewed, while, he, was, physically, and, mentally, exhausted, and, in, a, lot, of, pain, he, had, suffered, severe, frostbite, he, later, had, five, fingertips, amputated, it, was, estimated, on, 14, may, that, sharp, summited, mount, everest, and, began, his, descent, down, but, 15, may, he, was, in, trouble, but, being, passed, by, climbers, on, their, way, up, and, down, on, 15, may, 2006, it, is, believed, he, was, suffering, from, hypoxia, and, was, about, 300, m, 1, 000, ft, from, the, summit, on, the, north, side, route, dawa, from, arun, treks, also, gave, oxygen, to, david, and, tried, to, help, him, move, repeatedly, for, perhaps, an, hour, but, he, could, not, get, david, to, stand, alone, or, even, stand, to, rest, on, his, shoulders, and, crying, dawa, had, to, leave, him, too, even, with, two, sherpas, it, was, not, going, to, be, possible, to, get, david, down, the, tricky, sections, below, the, tribune, of, chandigarh, india, quoted, someone, who, described, what, happened, to, sharp, as, the, most, shameful, act, in, the, history, of, mountaineering, in, addition, to, sharp, s, death, at, least, nine, other, climbers, perished, that, year, including, multiple, sherpas, working, for, various, guiding, companies, much, of, this, controversy, was, captured, by, the, discovery, channel, while, filming, the, television, program, everest, beyond, the, limit, a, crucial, decision, affecting, the, fate, of, sharp, is, shown, in, the, program, where, an, early, returning, climber, lebanese, adventurer, maxim, chaya, is, descending, from, the, summit, and, radios, to, his, base, camp, manager, russell, brice, that, he, has, found, a, frostbitten, and, unconscious, climber, in, distress, chaya, is, unable, to, identify, sharp, who, had, chosen, to, climb, solo, without, any, support, and, so, did, not, identify, himself, to, other, climbers, the, base, camp, manager, assumes, that, sharp, is, part, of, a, group, that, has, already, calculated, that, they, must, abandon, him, and, informs, his, lone, climber, that, there, is, no, chance, of, him, being, able, to, help, sharp, by, himself, as, sharp, s, condition, deteriorates, through, the, day, and, other, descending, climbers, pass, him, his, opportunities, for, rescue, diminish, his, legs, and, feet, curl, from, frostbite, preventing, him, from, walking, the, later, descending, climbers, are, lower, on, oxygen, and, lack, the, strength, to, offer, aid, time, runs, out, for, any, sherpas, to, return, and, rescue, him, david, sharp, s, body, remained, just, below, the, summit, on, the, chinese, side, next, to, green, boots, they, shared, a, space, in, a, small, rock, cave, that, was, an, ad, hoc, tomb, for, them, sharp, s, body, was, removed, from, the, cave, in, 2007, according, to, the, bbc, and, since, 2014, green, boots, has, been, missing, presumably, removed, or, buried, as, the, sharp, debate, kicked, off, on, 26, may, 2006, australian, climber, lincoln, hall, was, found, alive, after, being, left, for, dead, the, day, before, he, was, found, by, a, party, of, four, climbers, dan, mazur, andrew, brash, myles, osborne, and, jangbu, sherpa, who, giving, up, their, own, summit, attempt, stayed, with, hall, and, descended, with, him, and, a, party, of, 11, sherpas, sent, up, to, carry, him, down, hall, later, fully, recovered, his, team, assumed, he, had, died, from, cerebral, edema, and, they, were, instructed, to, cover, him, with, rocks, there, were, no, rocks, around, to, do, this, and, he, was, abandoned, the, erroneous, information, of, his, death, was, passed, on, to, his, family, the, next, day, he, was, discovered, alive, by, another, party, on, 21, may, 2007, canadian, climber, meagan, mcgrath, initiated, the, successful, high, altitude, rescue, of, nepali, usha, bista, major, mcgrath, was, selected, as, a, 2011, recipient, of, the, sir, edmund, hillary, foundation, of, canada, humanitarian, award, which, recognises, a, canadian, who, has, personally, or, administratively, contributed, a, significant, service, or, act, in, the, himalayan, region, of, nepal, by, the, end, of, the, 2010, climbing, season, there, had, been, 5, 104, ascents, to, the, summit, by, about, 3, 142, individuals, with, 77, per, cent, of, these, ascents, being, accomplished, since, 2000, the, summit, was, achieved, in, 7, of, the, 22, years, from, 1953, to, 1974, and, was, not, missed, between, 1975, and, 2014, in, 2007, the, record, number, of, 633, ascents, was, recorded, by, 350, climbers, and, 253, sherpas, an, illustration, of, the, explosion, of, popularity, of, everest, is, provided, by, the, numbers, of, daily, ascents, analysis, of, the, 1996, mount, everest, disaster, shows, that, part, of, the, blame, was, on, the, bottleneck, caused, by, a, large, number, of, climbers, 33, to, 36, attempting, to, summit, on, the, same, day, this, was, considered, unusually, high, at, the, time, by, comparison, on, 23, may, 2010, the, summit, of, mount, everest, was, reached, by, 169, climbers, more, summits, in, a, single, day, than, in, the, cumulative, 31, years, from, the, first, successful, summit, in, 1953, through, 1983, there, have, been, 219, fatalities, recorded, on, mount, everest, from, the, 1922, british, mount, everest, expedition, through, the, end, of, 2010, a, rate, of, 4, 3, fatalities, for, every, 100, summits, this, is, a, general, rate, and, includes, fatalities, amongst, support, climbers, those, who, turned, back, before, the, peak, those, who, died, en, route, to, the, peak, and, those, who, died, while, descending, from, the, peak, of, the, 219, fatalities, 58, 26, 5, per, cent, were, climbers, who, had, summited, but, did, not, complete, their, descent, though, the, rate, of, fatalities, has, decreased, since, the, year, 2000, 1, 4, fatalities, for, every, 100, summits, with, 3938, summits, since, 2000, the, significant, increase, in, the, total, number, of, climbers, still, means, 54, fatalities, since, 2000, 33, on, the, northeast, ridge, 17, on, the, southeast, ridge, 2, on, the, southwest, face, and, 2, on, the, north, face, nearly, all, attempts, at, the, summit, are, done, using, one, of, the, two, main, routes, the, traffic, seen, by, each, route, varies, from, year, to, year, in, 2005, 07, more, than, half, of, all, climbers, elected, to, use, the, more, challenging, but, cheaper, northeast, route, in, 2008, the, northeast, route, was, closed, by, the, chinese, government, for, the, entire, climbing, season, and, the, only, people, able, to, reach, the, summit, from, the, north, that, year, were, athletes, responsible, for, carrying, the, olympic, torch, for, the, 2008, summer, olympics, the, route, was, closed, to, foreigners, once, again, in, 2009, in, the, run, up, to, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, dalai, lama, s, exile, these, closures, led, to, declining, interest, in, the, north, route, and, in, 2010, two, thirds, of, the, climbers, reached, the, summit, from, the, south, the, 2010s, were, a, time, of, new, highs, and, lows, for, the, mountain, with, back, to, back, disasters, in, 2013, and, 2014, causing, record, deaths, in, 2015, there, were, no, summits, for, the, first, time, in, decades, however, other, years, set, records, for, numbers, of, summits, 2013, s, record, number, of, summiters, around, 667, was, surpassed, in, 2018, with, around, 800, summiting, the, peak, and, a, subsequent, record, was, set, in, 2019, with, over, 890, summiters, on, 18, april, 2014, an, avalanche, hit, the, area, just, below, base, camp, 2, sixteen, people, were, killed, all, nepali, guides, and, nine, more, were, injured, in, response, to, the, tragedy, numerous, sherpa, climbing, guides, walked, off, the, job, and, most, climbing, companies, pulled, out, in, respect, for, the, sherpa, people, mourning, the, loss, during, the, season, 13, year, old, malavath, purna, reached, the, summit, becoming, the, youngest, female, climber, to, do, so, one, team, used, a, helicopter, to, fly, from, south, base, camp, to, camp, 2, to, avoid, the, khumbu, icefall, then, reached, the, everest, summit, this, team, had, to, use, the, south, side, because, the, chinese, had, denied, them, a, permit, to, climb, a, team, member, jing, wang, donated, us, 30, 000, to, a, local, hospital, she, was, named, the, nepali, international, mountaineer, of, the, year, over, 100, people, summited, everest, from, china, tibet, region, and, six, from, nepal, in, the, 2014, season, this, included, 72, year, old, bill, burke, the, indian, teenage, girl, and, a, chinese, woman, jing, wang, another, teen, girl, summiter, was, ming, kipa, sherpa, who, summited, with, her, elder, sister, lhakpa, sherpa, in, 2003, and, who, had, achieved, the, most, times, for, woman, to, the, summit, of, mount, everest, at, that, time, see, also, santosh, yadav, 2015, was, set, to, be, a, record, breaking, season, of, climbs, with, hundreds, of, permits, issued, in, nepal, and, many, additional, permits, in, tibet, china, however, on, 25, april, 2015, an, earthquake, measuring, 7, 8, m, w, triggered, an, avalanche, that, hit, everest, base, camp, effectively, shutting, down, the, everest, climbing, season, 18, bodies, were, recovered, from, mount, everest, by, the, indian, army, mountaineering, team, the, avalanche, began, on, pumori, moved, through, the, khumbu, icefall, on, the, southwest, side, of, mount, everest, and, slammed, into, the, south, base, camp, 2015, was, the, first, time, since, 1974, with, no, spring, summits, as, all, climbing, teams, pulled, out, after, the, quakes, and, avalanche, one, of, the, reasons, for, this, was, the, high, probability, of, aftershocks, over, 50, per, cent, according, to, the, united, states, geological, survey, just, weeks, after, the, first, quake, the, region, was, rattled, again, by, a, 7, 3, magnitude, quake, and, there, were, also, many, considerable, aftershocks, the, quakes, trapped, hundreds, of, climbers, above, the, khumbu, icefall, and, they, had, to, be, evacuated, by, helicopter, as, they, ran, low, on, supplies, the, quake, shifted, the, route, through, the, ice, fall, making, it, essentially, impassable, to, climbers, bad, weather, also, made, helicopter, evacuation, difficult, the, everest, tragedy, was, small, compared, to, the, impact, overall, on, nepal, with, almost, nine, thousand, dead, and, about, 22, 000, injured, in, tibet, by, 28, april, at, least, 25, had, died, and, 117, were, injured, by, 29, april, 2015, the, tibet, mountaineering, association, north, chinese, side, closed, everest, and, other, peaks, to, climbing, stranding, 25, teams, and, about, 300, people, on, the, north, side, of, everest, on, the, south, side, helicopters, evacuated, 180, people, trapped, at, camps, 1, and, 2, on, 24, august, 2015, nepal, re, opened, everest, to, tourism, including, mountain, climbers, the, only, climber, permit, for, the, autumn, season, was, awarded, to, japanese, climber, nobukazu, kuriki, who, had, tried, four, times, previously, to, summit, everest, without, success, he, made, his, fifth, attempt, in, october, but, had, to, give, up, just, 700, m, 2, 300, ft, from, the, summit, due, to, strong, winds, and, deep, snow, some, sections, of, the, trail, from, lukla, to, everest, base, camp, nepal, were, damaged, in, the, earthquakes, earlier, in, the, year, and, needed, repairs, to, handle, trekkers, hawley, s, database, records, 641, made, it, to, the, summit, in, early, 2016, 2017, was, the, biggest, season, yet, permit, wise, yielding, hundreds, of, summiters, and, a, handful, of, deaths, on, 27, may, 2017, kami, rita, made, his, 21st, climb, to, the, summit, with, the, alpine, ascents, everest, expedition, one, of, three, people, in, the, world, along, with, apa, sherpa, and, phurba, tashi, sherpa, to, make, it, to, the, summit, of, mount, everest, 21, times, the, season, had, a, tragic, start, with, the, death, of, ueli, steck, of, switzerland, who, died, from, a, fall, during, a, warm, up, climb, there, was, a, continued, discussion, about, the, nature, of, possible, changes, to, the, hillary, step, total, summiters, for, 2017, was, tallied, up, to, be, 648, 449, summited, via, nepal, from, the, south, and, 120, from, chinese, tibet, north, side, 807, climbers, summited, mount, everest, in, 2018, including, 563, on, the, nepal, side, and, 240, from, the, chinese, tibet, side, this, broke, the, previous, record, for, total, summits, in, year, from, which, was, 667, in, 2013, and, one, factor, that, aided, in, this, was, an, especially, long, and, clear, weather, window, of, 11, days, during, the, critical, spring, climbing, season, various, records, were, broken, including, a, summit, by, double, amputee, xia, boyu, who, undertook, his, climb, after, winning, a, court, case, in, the, nepali, supreme, court, there, were, no, major, disasters, but, seven, climbers, including, sherpas, as, well, as, international, climbers, died, in, various, situations, although, record, numbers, of, climbers, reached, the, summit, old, time, summiters, that, made, expeditions, in, the, 1980s, lamented, the, crowding, feces, and, cost, figures, for, the, number, of, permits, issued, by, nepal, range, from, 347, to, 375, the, spring, or, pre, monsoon, window, for, 2019, witnessed, the, deaths, of, a, number, of, climbers, worldwide, publication, of, images, of, hundreds, of, mountaineers, queuing, to, reach, the, summit, and, sensational, media, reports, of, climbers, stepping, over, dead, bodies, dismayed, people, around, the, world, there, were, reports, of, various, winter, expeditions, in, the, himalayas, including, k2, nanga, parbat, and, meru, with, the, buzz, for, the, everest, 2019, beginning, just, 14, weeks, to, the, weather, window, noted, climber, cory, richards, announced, on, twitter, that, he, was, hoping, to, establish, a, new, climbing, route, to, the, summit, in, 2019, also, announced, was, an, expedition, to, re, measure, the, height, of, everest, particularly, in, light, of, the, 2015, earthquakes, china, closed, the, base, camp, to, those, without, climbing, permits, in, february, 2019, on, the, northern, side, of, mount, everest, by, early, april, climbing, teams, from, around, the, world, were, arriving, for, the, 2019, spring, climbing, season, among, the, teams, was, a, scientific, expedition, with, a, planned, study, of, pollution, and, how, things, like, snow, and, vegetation, influence, the, availability, of, food, and, water, in, the, region, in, the, 2019, spring, mountaineering, season, there, were, roughly, 40, teams, with, almost, 400, climbers, and, several, hundred, guides, attempting, to, summit, on, the, nepali, side, nepal, issued, 381, climbing, permits, for, 2019, for, the, northern, routes, in, chinese, tibet, several, hundred, more, permits, were, issued, for, climbing, by, authorities, there, in, may, 2019, nepali, mountaineering, guide, kami, rita, summited, mount, everest, twice, within, a, week, his, 23rd, and, 24th, ascents, making, international, news, headlines, he, first, summited, everest, in, 1994, and, has, summited, several, other, extremely, high, mountains, such, as, k2, and, lhotse, by, 23, may, 2019, about, seven, people, had, died, possibly, due, to, crowding, leading, to, delays, high, on, the, mountain, and, shorter, weather, windows, one, 19, year, old, who, summited, previously, noted, that, when, the, weather, window, opens, long, lines, form, as, everyone, rushes, to, get, the, top, and, back, down, in, chinese, tibet, one, austrian, climber, died, from, a, fall, and, by, 26, may, 2019, the, overall, number, of, deaths, for, the, spring, climbing, season, rose, to, 10, by, 28, may, the, death, toll, increased, to, 11, when, a, climber, died, at, about, 7, 900, m, 26, 000, ft, during, the, descent, and, a, 12th, climber, missing, and, presumed, dead, despite, the, number, of, deaths, reports, indicated, that, a, record, 891, climbers, summited, in, the, spring, 2019, climbing, season, although, china, has, had, various, permit, restrictions, and, nepal, requires, a, doctor, to, sign, off, on, climbing, permits, the, natural, dangers, of, climbing, such, as, falls, and, avalanches, combined, with, medical, issues, aggravated, by, everest, s, extreme, altitude, led, to, 2019, being, a, year, with, a, comparatively, high, death, toll, both, nepal, and, china, prohibited, foreign, climbing, groups, during, the, 2020, season, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, 2020, was, the, third, year, in, this, decade, after, 2014, and, 2015, which, saw, no, summits, from, the, nepal, south, side, a, team, of, chinese, surveyors, climbed, mt, everest, from, the, north, side, during, april, may, 2020, becoming, the, only, climbers, to, summit, the, world, s, highest, peak, during, the, pandemic, at, least, through, may, the, team, was, there, to, re, measure, the, height, of, mount, everest, on, 12, may, 2022, the, first, all, black, team, summited, mt, everest, seven, men, and, two, women, climbers, from, the, u, s, and, kenya, guided, by, eight, sherpas, comprised, the, expedition, in, 2014, nepal, issued, 334, climbing, permits, which, were, extended, until, 2019, due, to, the, closure, in, 2015, nepal, issued, 357, permits, but, the, mountain, was, closed, again, because, of, the, avalanche, and, earthquake, and, these, permits, were, given, a, two, year, extension, to, 2017, in, 2017, a, person, who, tried, to, climb, everest, without, the, 11, 000, permit, was, caught, after, he, made, it, past, the, khumbu, icefall, he, faced, among, other, penalties, a, 22, 000, fine, and, a, possible, four, years, in, jail, in, the, end, he, was, allowed, to, return, home, but, banned, from, mountaineering, in, nepal, for, 10, years, the, number, of, permits, issued, each, year, by, nepal, is, the, chinese, side, in, tibet, is, also, managed, with, permits, for, summiting, everest, they, did, not, issue, permits, in, 2008, due, to, the, olympic, torch, relay, being, taken, to, the, summit, of, mount, everest, in, march, 2020, the, governments, of, china, and, nepal, cancelled, all, climbing, permits, for, mount, everest, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, april, 2020, a, group, of, chinese, mountaineers, began, an, expedition, from, the, chinese, side, the, mountain, remained, closed, on, the, chinese, side, to, all, foreign, climbers, on, 10, may, 2021, a, separation, line, was, announced, by, chinese, authorities, to, prevent, the, spread, of, coronavirus, from, climbers, ascending, nepal, s, side, according, to, jon, krakauer, the, era, of, commercialisation, of, everest, started, in, 1985, when, the, summit, was, reached, by, a, guided, expedition, led, by, david, breashears, that, included, richard, bass, a, wealthy, 55, year, old, businessman, and, an, amateur, mountain, climber, with, four, years, of, climbing, experience, by, the, early, 1990s, several, companies, were, offering, guided, tours, to, the, mountain, rob, hall, one, of, the, mountaineers, who, died, in, the, 1996, disaster, had, successfully, guided, 39, clients, to, the, summit, before, that, incident, 24, 42, by, 2016, most, guiding, services, cost, between, us, 35, 000, and, us, 200, 000, going, with, a, celebrity, guide, usually, a, well, known, mountaineer, typically, with, decades, of, climbing, experience, and, perhaps, several, everest, summits, can, cost, over, 100, 000, as, of, 2015, however, the, services, offered, vary, widely, and, it, is, buyer, beware, when, doing, deals, in, nepal, one, of, the, poorest, and, least, developed, countries, in, the, world, tourism, contributed, 7, 9, per, cent, of, the, gross, domestic, product, gdp, in, 2019, in, a, country, with, high, unemployment, but, an, everest, porter, can, make, nearly, double, the, nation, s, average, wage, in, a, region, in, which, other, sources, of, income, are, lacking, costs, beyond, the, guiding, service, can, vary, widely, it, is, technically, possible, to, reach, the, summit, with, minimal, additional, expenses, and, there, are, budget, travel, agencies, that, offer, logistical, support, for, such, trips, a, limited, support, service, offering, only, some, meals, at, base, camp, and, bureaucratic, overhead, like, a, permit, can, cost, as, little, as, us, 7, 000, as, of, 2007, however, this, is, considered, difficult, and, dangerous, as, illustrated, by, the, case, of, david, sharp, climbing, gear, required, to, reach, the, summit, may, cost, in, excess, of, us, 8, 000, and, most, climbers, also, use, bottled, oxygen, which, adds, around, us, 3, 000, the, permit, to, enter, the, everest, area, from, the, south, via, nepal, costs, us, 10, 000, to, us, 30, 000, per, person, depending, on, the, size, of, the, team, the, ascent, typically, starts, at, one, of, the, two, base, camps, near, the, mountain, both, of, which, are, approximately, 100, kilometres, 60, mi, from, kathmandu, and, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, from, lhasa, the, two, nearest, cities, with, major, airports, transferring, one, s, equipment, from, the, airport, to, the, base, camp, may, add, as, much, as, us, 2, 000, many, climbers, hire, full, service, guide, companies, which, provide, a, wide, spectrum, of, services, including, the, acquisition, of, permits, transportation, to, from, base, camp, food, tents, fixed, ropes, medical, assistance, while, on, the, mountain, an, experienced, mountaineer, guide, and, even, personal, porters, to, carry, one, s, backpack, and, cook, one, s, meals, the, cost, of, such, a, guide, service, may, range, from, us, 40, 000, to, 80, 000, per, person, since, most, equipment, is, moved, by, sherpas, clients, of, full, service, guide, companies, can, often, keep, their, backpack, weights, under, 10, kilograms, 22, lb, or, hire, a, sherpa, to, carry, their, backpack, for, them, by, contrast, climbers, attempting, less, commercialised, peaks, like, denali, are, often, expected, to, carry, backpacks, over, 30, kilograms, 66, lb, and, occasionally, to, tow, a, sled, with, 35, kilograms, 77, lb, of, gear, and, food, the, degree, of, commercialisation, of, mount, everest, is, a, frequent, subject, of, criticism, jamling, tenzing, norgay, the, son, of, tenzing, norgay, said, in, a, 2003, interview, that, his, late, father, would, have, been, shocked, to, discover, that, rich, thrill, seekers, with, no, climbing, experience, were, now, routinely, reaching, the, summit, you, still, have, to, climb, this, mountain, yourself, with, your, feet, but, the, spirit, of, adventure, is, not, there, any, more, it, is, lost, there, are, people, going, up, there, who, have, no, idea, how, to, put, on, crampons, they, are, climbing, because, they, have, paid, someone, 65, 000, it, is, very, selfish, it, endangers, the, lives, of, others, one, example, of, this, is, shriya, shah, klorfine, who, had, to, be, taught, how, to, put, on, crampons, during, her, summit, attempt, in, 2012, she, paid, at, least, us, 40, 000, to, a, new, guiding, company, for, the, trip, and, died, when, she, ran, out, of, oxygen, during, the, descent, after, climbing, for, 27, hours, straight, reinhold, messner, concurred, in, 2004, you, could, die, in, each, climb, and, that, meant, you, were, responsible, for, yourself, we, were, real, mountaineers, careful, aware, and, even, afraid, by, climbing, mountains, we, were, not, learning, how, big, we, were, we, were, finding, out, how, breakable, how, weak, and, how, full, of, fear, we, are, you, can, only, get, this, if, you, expose, yourself, to, high, danger, i, have, always, said, that, a, mountain, without, danger, is, not, a, mountain, high, altitude, alpinism, has, become, tourism, and, show, these, commercial, trips, to, everest, they, are, still, dangerous, but, the, guides, and, organisers, tell, clients, don, t, worry, it, s, all, organised, the, route, is, prepared, by, hundreds, of, sherpas, extra, oxygen, is, available, in, all, camps, right, up, to, the, summit, people, will, cook, for, you, and, lay, out, your, beds, clients, feel, safe, and, don, t, care, about, the, risks, by, 2015, nepal, was, considering, requiring, that, climbers, have, some, experience, hoping, this, would, both, make, the, mountain, safer, and, increase, revenue, one, barrier, to, this, is, that, low, budget, firms, make, money, not, taking, inexperienced, climbers, to, the, summit, those, turned, away, by, western, firms, can, often, find, another, firm, willing, to, take, them, for, a, price, that, they, return, home, soon, after, arriving, after, base, camp, or, part, way, up, the, mountain, however, not, all, opinions, on, the, subject, among, prominent, mountaineers, have, been, strictly, negative, for, example, edmund, hillary, stated, in, 2003, that, while, having, people, pay, 65, 000, and, then, be, led, up, the, mountain, by, a, couple, of, experienced, guides, isn, t, really, mountaineering, at, all, he, was, pleased, by, the, changes, brought, to, everest, area, by, westerners, i, don, t, have, any, regrets, because, i, worked, very, hard, indeed, to, improve, the, condition, for, the, local, people, when, we, first, went, in, there, they, didn, t, have, any, schools, they, didn, t, have, any, medical, facilities, all, over, the, years, we, have, established, 27, schools, we, have, two, hospitals, and, a, dozen, medical, clinics, and, then, we, ve, built, bridges, over, wild, mountain, rivers, and, put, in, fresh, water, pipelines, so, in, cooperation, with, the, sherpas, we, ve, done, a, lot, to, benefit, them, one, of, the, early, guided, summiters, richard, bass, of, seven, summits, fame, stated, in, 2003, that, climbers, should, have, high, altitude, experience, before, they, attempt, the, really, big, mountains, people, don, t, realise, the, difference, between, a, 20, 000, foot, mountain, and, 29, 000, foot, it, s, not, just, arithmetic, the, reduction, of, oxygen, in, the, air, is, proportionate, to, the, altitude, alright, but, the, effect, on, the, human, body, is, disproportionate, an, exponential, curve, people, climb, denali, or, aconcagua, and, think, heck, i, feel, great, up, here, i, m, going, to, try, everest, but, it, s, not, like, that, mount, everest, has, two, main, climbing, routes, the, southeast, ridge, from, nepal, and, the, north, ridge, from, tibet, as, well, as, many, other, less, frequently, climbed, routes, of, the, two, main, routes, the, southeast, ridge, is, technically, easier, and, more, frequently, used, it, was, the, route, used, by, edmund, hillary, and, tenzing, norgay, in, 1953, and, the, first, recognised, of, 15, routes, to, the, top, by, 1996, this, was, however, a, route, decision, dictated, more, by, politics, than, by, design, as, the, chinese, border, was, closed, to, the, western, world, in, the, 1950s, after, the, people, s, republic, of, china, invaded, tibet, most, attempts, are, made, during, may, before, the, summer, monsoon, season, as, the, monsoon, season, approaches, the, jet, stream, shifts, northward, thereby, reducing, the, average, wind, speeds, high, on, the, mountain, while, attempts, are, sometimes, made, in, september, and, october, after, the, monsoons, when, the, jet, stream, is, again, temporarily, pushed, northward, the, additional, snow, deposited, by, the, monsoons, and, the, less, stable, weather, patterns, at, the, monsoons, tail, end, makes, climbing, extremely, difficult, the, ascent, via, the, southeast, ridge, begins, with, a, trek, to, base, camp, at, 5, 380, m, 17, 700, ft, on, the, south, side, of, everest, in, nepal, expeditions, usually, fly, into, lukla, 2, 860, m, from, kathmandu, and, pass, through, namche, bazaar, climbers, then, hike, to, base, camp, which, usually, takes, six, to, eight, days, allowing, for, proper, altitude, acclimatisation, in, order, to, prevent, altitude, sickness, climbing, equipment, and, supplies, are, carried, by, yaks, dzopkyos, yak, cow, hybrids, and, human, porters, to, base, camp, on, the, khumbu, glacier, when, hillary, and, tenzing, climbed, everest, in, 1953, the, british, expedition, they, were, part, of, comprising, over, 400, climbers, porters, and, sherpas, at, that, point, started, from, the, kathmandu, valley, as, there, were, no, roads, further, east, at, that, time, climbers, spend, a, couple, of, weeks, in, base, camp, acclimatising, to, the, altitude, during, that, time, sherpas, and, some, expedition, climbers, set, up, ropes, and, ladders, in, the, treacherous, khumbu, icefall, seracs, crevasses, and, shifting, blocks, of, ice, make, the, icefall, one, of, the, most, dangerous, sections, of, the, route, many, climbers, and, sherpas, have, been, killed, in, this, section, to, reduce, the, hazard, climbers, usually, begin, their, ascent, well, before, dawn, when, the, freezing, temperatures, glue, ice, blocks, in, place, above, the, icefall, is, camp, i, at, 6, 065, metres, 19, 900, ft, from, camp, i, climbers, make, their, way, up, the, western, cwm, to, the, base, of, the, lhotse, face, where, camp, ii, or, advanced, base, camp, abc, is, established, at, 6, 500, m, 21, 300, ft, the, western, cwm, is, a, flat, gently, rising, glacial, valley, marked, by, huge, lateral, crevasses, in, the, centre, which, prevent, direct, access, to, the, upper, reaches, of, the, cwm, climbers, are, forced, to, cross, on, the, far, right, near, the, base, of, nuptse, to, a, small, passageway, known, as, the, nuptse, corner, the, western, cwm, is, also, called, the, valley, of, silence, as, the, topography, of, the, area, generally, cuts, off, wind, from, the, climbing, route, the, high, altitude, and, a, clear, windless, day, can, make, the, western, cwm, unbearably, hot, for, climbers, from, camp, ii, climbers, ascend, the, lhotse, face, on, fixed, ropes, up, to, camp, iii, located, on, a, small, ledge, at, 7, 470, m, 24, 500, ft, from, there, it, is, another, 500, metres, to, camp, iv, on, the, south, col, at, 7, 920, m, 26, 000, ft, from, camp, iii, to, camp, iv, climbers, are, faced, with, two, additional, challenges, the, geneva, spur, and, the, yellow, band, the, geneva, spur, is, an, anvil, shaped, rib, of, black, rock, named, by, the, 1952, swiss, expedition, fixed, ropes, assist, climbers, in, scrambling, over, this, snow, covered, rock, band, the, yellow, band, is, a, section, of, interlayered, marble, phyllite, and, semischist, which, also, requires, about, 100, metres, of, rope, for, traversing, it, on, the, south, col, climbers, enter, the, death, zone, climbers, making, summit, bids, typically, can, endure, no, more, than, two, or, three, days, at, this, altitude, if, the, weather, is, not, clear, with, low, winds, during, these, short, few, days, climbers, are, forced, to, descend, many, all, the, way, back, down, to, base, camp, from, camp, iv, climbers, begin, their, summit, push, around, midnight, with, hopes, of, reaching, the, summit, still, another, 1, 000, metres, above, within, 10, to, 12, hours, climbers, first, reach, the, balcony, at, 8, 400, m, 27, 600, ft, a, small, platform, where, they, can, rest, and, gaze, at, peaks, to, the, south, and, east, in, the, early, light, of, dawn, continuing, up, the, ridge, climbers, are, then, faced, with, a, series, of, imposing, rock, steps, which, usually, forces, them, to, the, east, into, the, waist, deep, snow, a, serious, avalanche, hazard, at, 8, 750, m, 28, 700, ft, a, small, table, sized, dome, of, ice, and, snow, marks, the, south, summit, from, the, south, summit, climbers, follow, the, knife, edge, southeast, ridge, along, what, is, known, as, the, cornice, traverse, where, snow, clings, to, intermittent, rock, this, is, the, most, exposed, section, of, the, climb, and, a, misstep, to, the, left, would, send, one, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, down, the, southwest, face, while, to, the, immediate, right, is, the, 3, 050, m, 10, 010, ft, kangshung, face, at, the, end, of, this, traverse, is, an, imposing, 12, m, 39, ft, rock, wall, the, hillary, step, at, 8, 790, m, 28, 840, ft, hillary, and, tenzing, were, the, first, climbers, to, ascend, this, step, and, they, did, so, using, primitive, ice, climbing, equipment, and, ropes, nowadays, climbers, ascend, this, step, using, fixed, ropes, previously, set, up, by, sherpas, once, above, the, step, it, is, a, comparatively, easy, climb, to, the, top, on, moderately, angled, snow, slopes, though, the, exposure, on, the, ridge, is, extreme, especially, while, traversing, large, cornices, of, snow, with, increasing, numbers, of, people, climbing, the, mountain, in, recent, years, the, step, has, frequently, become, a, bottleneck, with, climbers, forced, to, wait, significant, amounts, of, time, for, their, turn, on, the, ropes, leading, to, problems, in, getting, climbers, efficiently, up, and, down, the, mountain, after, the, hillary, step, climbers, also, must, traverse, a, loose, and, rocky, section, that, has, a, large, entanglement, of, fixed, ropes, that, can, be, troublesome, in, bad, weather, climbers, typically, spend, less, than, half, an, hour, at, the, summit, to, allow, time, to, descend, to, camp, iv, before, darkness, sets, in, to, avoid, serious, problems, with, afternoon, weather, or,

climbing, aid, called, the, chinese, ladder, a, metal, ladder, placed, semi, permanently, in, 1975, by, a, party, of, chinese, climbers, it, has, been, almost, continuously, in, place, since, and, ladders, have, been, used, by, virtually, all, climbers, on, the, route, once, above, the, second, step, the, inconsequential, third, step, is, clambered, over, ascending, from, 8, 690, to, 8, 800, m,

summit, of, everest, has, been, described, as, the, size, of, a, dining, room, table, the, summit, is, capped, with, snow, over, ice, over, rock, and, the, layer, of, snow, varies, from, year, to, year, the, rock, summit, is, made, of, ordovician, limestone, and, is, a, low, grade, metamorphic, rock, see, the, surveys, section, for, more, on, its, height, and, about, the, everest, rock, summit, below, the, summit, there, is, an, area, known, as, rainbow, valley, filled, with, dead, bodies, still, wearing, brightly, coloured, winter, gear, down, to, about, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, is, an, area, commonly, called, the, death, zone, due, to, the, high, danger, and, low, oxygen, because, of, the, low, pressure, below, the, summit, the, mountain, slopes, downward, to, the, three, main, sides, or, faces, of, mount, everest, the, north, face, the, south, west, face, and, the, east, kangshung, face, at, the, higher, regions, of, mount, everest, climbers, seeking, the, summit, typically, spend, substantial, time, within, the, death, zone, altitudes, higher, than, 8, 000, metres, 26, 000, ft, and, face, significant, challenges, to, survival, temperatures, can, dip, to, very, low, levels, resulting, in, frostbite, of, any, body, part, exposed, to, the, air, since, temperatures, are, so, low, snow, is, well, frozen, in, certain, areas, and, death, or, injury, by, slipping, and, falling, can, occur, high, winds, at, these, altitudes, on, everest, are, also, a, potential, threat, to, climbers, another, significant, threat, to, climbers, is, low, atmospheric, pressure, the, atmospheric, pressure, at, the, top, of, everest, is, about, a, third, of, sea, level, pressure, or, 0, 333, standard, atmospheres, 337, mbar, resulting, in, the, availability, of, only, about, a, third, as, much, oxygen, to, breathe, debilitating, effects, of, the, death, zone, are, so, great, that, it, takes, most, climbers, up, to, 12, hours, to, walk, the, distance, of, 1, 72, kilometres, 1, 07, mi, from, south, col, to, the, summit, achieving, even, this, level, of, performance, requires, prolonged, altitude, acclimatisation, which, takes, 40, 60, days, for, a, typical, expedition, a, sea, level, dweller, exposed, to, the, atmospheric, conditions, at, the, altitude, above, 8, 500, m, 27, 900, ft, without, acclimatisation, would, likely, lose, consciousness, within, two, to, three, minutes, in, may, 2007, the, caudwell, xtreme, everest, undertook, a, medical, study, of, oxygen, levels, in, human, blood, at, extreme, altitude, over, 200, volunteers, climbed, to, everest, base, camp, where, various, medical, tests, were, performed, to, examine, blood, oxygen, levels, a, small, team, also, performed, tests, on, the, way, to, the, summit, even, at, base, camp, the, low, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, had, direct, effect, on, blood, oxygen, saturation, levels, at, sea, level, blood, oxygen, saturation, is, generally, 98, to, 99, per, cent, at, base, camp, blood, saturation, fell, to, between, 85, and, 87, per, cent, blood, samples, taken, at, the, summit, indicated, very, low, oxygen, levels, in, the, blood, a, side, effect, of, low, blood, oxygen, is, a, greatly, increased, breathing, rate, often, 80, 90, breaths, per, minute, as, opposed, to, a, more, typical, 20, 30, exhaustion, can, occur, merely, by, attempting, to, breathe, lack, of, oxygen, exhaustion, extreme, cold, and, climbing, hazards, all, contribute, to, the, death, toll, an, injured, person, who, cannot, walk, is, in, serious, trouble, since, rescue, by, helicopter, is, generally, impractical, and, carrying, the, person, off, the, mountain, is, very, risky, people, who, die, during, the, climb, are, typically, left, behind, as, of, 2015, over, 200, bodies, remain, on, the, mountain, debilitating, symptoms, consistent, with, high, altitude, cerebral, oedema, commonly, present, during, descent, from, the, summit, of, mount, everest, profound, fatigue, and, late, times, in, reaching, the, summit, are, early, features, associated, with, subsequent, death, a, 2008, study, noted, that, the, death, zone, is, indeed, where, most, everest, deaths, occur, but, also, noted, that, most, deaths, occur, during, descent, from, the, summit, a, 2014, article, in, the, atlantic, about, deaths, on, everest, noted, that, while, falling, is, one, of, the, greatest, dangers, the, death, zone, presents, for, all, 8000ers, avalanches, are, a, more, common, cause, of, death, at, lower, altitudes, despite, this, everest, is, safer, for, climbers, than, a, number, of, peaks, by, some, measurements, but, it, depends, on, the, period, some, examples, are, kangchenjunga, k2, annapurna, nanga, parbat, and, the, eiger, especially, the, nordwand, some, factors, that, affect, total, mountain, lethality, include, the, level, of, popularity, of, the, mountain, the, skill, of, those, climbing, and, the, difficulty, of, the, climb, another, health, hazard, is, retinal, haemorrhages, which, can, damage, eyesight, and, cause, blindness, up, to, a, quarter, of, everest, climbers, can, experience, retinal, haemorrhages, and, although, they, usually, heal, within, weeks, of, returning, to, lower, altitudes, in, 2010, a, climber, went, blind, and, died, in, the, death, zone, at, one, o, clock, in, the, afternoon, the, british, climber, peter, kinloch, was, on, the, roof, of, the, world, in, bright, sunlight, taking, photographs, of, the, himalayas, below, elated, cheery, and, bubbly, but, mount, everest, is, now, his, grave, because, only, minutes, later, he, suddenly, went, blind, and, had, to, be, abandoned, to, die, from, the, cold, the, team, made, a, huge, effort, for, the, next, 12, hours, to, try, to, get, him, down, the, mountain, but, to, no, avail, as, they, were, unsuccessful, in, getting, him, through, the, difficult, sections, even, for, the, able, the, everest, north, east, ridge, is, recognised, as, a, challenge, it, is, hard, to, rescue, someone, who, has, become, incapacitated, and, it, can, be, beyond, the, ability, of, rescuers, to, save, anyone, in, such, a, difficult, spot, one, way, around, this, situation, was, pioneered, by, two, nepali, men, in, 2011, who, had, intended, to, paraglide, off, the, summit, they, had, no, choice, and, were, forced, to, go, through, with, their, plan, anyway, because, they, had, run, out, of, bottled, oxygen, and, supplies, they, successfully, launched, off, the, summit, and, para, glided, down, to, namche, bazaar, in, just, 42, minutes, without, having, to, climb, down, the, mountain, most, expeditions, use, oxygen, masks, and, tanks, above, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, everest, can, be, climbed, without, supplementary, oxygen, but, only, by, the, most, accomplished, mountaineers, and, at, increased, risk, humans, ability, to, think, clearly, is, hindered, with, low, oxygen, and, the, combination, of, extreme, weather, low, temperatures, and, steep, slopes, often, requires, quick, accurate, decisions, while, about, 95, per, cent, of, climbers, who, reach, the, summit, use, bottled, oxygen, in, order, to, reach, the, top, about, five, per, cent, of, climbers, have, summited, everest, without, supplemental, oxygen, the, death, rate, is, double, for, those, who, attempt, to, reach, the, summit, without, supplemental, oxygen, travelling, above, 2, 400, m, 8, 000, ft, altitude, is, a, factor, in, cerebral, hypoxia, one, study, found, that, mount, everest, may, be, the, highest, an, acclimatised, human, could, go, but, also, found, that, climbers, may, suffer, permanent, neurological, damage, despite, returning, to, lower, altitudes, the, use, of, bottled, oxygen, to, ascend, mount, everest, has, been, controversial, it, was, first, used, on, the, 1922, british, mount, everest, expedition, by, george, finch, and, geoffrey, bruce, who, climbed, up, to, 7, 800, m, 25, 600, ft, at, a, spectacular, speed, of, 300, vertical, metres, 1, 000, ft, per, hour, pinned, down, by, a, fierce, storm, they, escaped, death, by, breathing, oxygen, from, a, jury, rigged, set, up, during, the, night, the, next, day, they, climbed, to, 8, 100, m, 26, 600, ft, at, 270, m, h, 900, ft, h, nearly, three, times, as, fast, as, non, oxygen, users, yet, the, use, of, oxygen, was, considered, so, unsportsmanlike, that, none, of, the, rest, of, the, alpine, world, recognised, this, high, ascent, rate, george, mallory, described, the, use, of, such, oxygen, as, unsportsmanlike, but, he, later, concluded, that, it, would, be, impossible, for, him, to, summit, without, it, and, consequently, used, it, on, his, final, attempt, in, 1924, when, tenzing, and, hillary, made, the, first, successful, summit, in, 1953, they, also, used, open, circuit, bottled, oxygen, sets, with, the, expedition, s, physiologist, griffith, pugh, referring, to, the, oxygen, debate, as, a, futile, controversy, noting, that, oxygen, greatly, increases, subjective, appreciation, of, the, surroundings, which, after, all, is, one, of, the, chief, reasons, for, climbing, for, the, next, twenty, five, years, bottled, oxygen, was, considered, standard, for, any, successful, summit, although, an, acclimatised, lowlander, can, survive, for, a, time, on, the, summit, of, everest, without, supplemental, oxygen, one, is, so, close, to, the, limit, that, even, a, modicum, of, excess, exertion, may, impair, brain, function, reinhold, messner, was, the, first, climber, to, break, the, bottled, oxygen, tradition, and, in, 1978, with, peter, habeler, made, the, first, successful, climb, without, it, in, 1980, messner, summited, the, mountain, solo, without, supplemental, oxygen, or, any, porters, or, climbing, partners, on, the, more, difficult, northwest, route, once, the, climbing, community, was, satisfied, that, the, mountain, could, be, climbed, without, supplemental, oxygen, many, purists, then, took, the, next, logical, step, of, insisting, that, is, how, it, should, be, climbed, 154, the, aftermath, of, the, 1996, disaster, further, intensified, the, debate, jon, krakauer, s, into, thin, air, 1997, expressed, the, author, s, personal, criticisms, of, the, use, of, bottled, oxygen, krakauer, wrote, that, the, use, of, bottled, oxygen, allowed, otherwise, unqualified, climbers, to, attempt, to, summit, leading, to, dangerous, situations, and, more, deaths, the, disaster, was, partially, caused, by, the, sheer, number, of, climbers, 34, on, that, day, attempting, to, ascend, causing, bottlenecks, at, the, hillary, step, and, delaying, many, climbers, most, of, whom, summited, after, the, usual, 14, 00, turnaround, time, he, proposed, banning, bottled, oxygen, except, for, emergency, cases, arguing, that, this, would, both, decrease, the, growing, pollution, on, everest, many, bottles, have, accumulated, on, its, slopes, and, keep, marginally, qualified, climbers, off, the, mountain, the, 1996, disaster, also, introduced, the, issue, of, the, guide, s, role, in, using, bottled, oxygen, guide, anatoli, boukreev, s, decision, not, to, use, bottled, oxygen, was, sharply, criticised, by, jon, krakauer, boukreev, s, supporters, who, include, g, weston, dewalt, who, co, wrote, the, climb, state, that, using, bottled, oxygen, gives, a, false, sense, of, security, krakauer, and, his, supporters, point, out, that, without, bottled, oxygen, boukreev, could, not, directly, help, his, clients, descend, the, low, oxygen, can, cause, a, mental, fog, like, impairment, of, cognitive, abilities, described, as, delayed, and, lethargic, thought, process, clinically, defined, as, bradypsychia, even, after, returning, to, lower, altitudes, in, severe, cases, climbers, can, experience, hallucinations, some, studies, have, found, that, high, altitude, climbers, including, everest, climbers, experience, altered, brain, structure, the, effects, of, high, altitude, on, the, brain, particularly, if, it, can, cause, permanent, brain, damage, continue, to, be, studied, although, generally, less, popular, than, spring, mount, everest, has, also, been, climbed, in, the, autumn, also, called, the, post, monsoon, season, for, example, in, 2010, eric, larsen, and, five, nepali, guides, summited, everest, in, the, autumn, for, the, first, time, in, ten, years, the, autumn, season, when, the, monsoon,

higher, camp, over, the, khumbu, icefall, in, august, 2014, however, she, stated, that, she, had, flown, to, camp, ii, because, the, icefall, was, impassable, if, you, don, t, fly, to, camp, ii, you, just, go, home, she, said, in, an, interview, in, that, same, interview, she, also, insisted, that, she, had, never, tried, to, hide, this, fact, her, team, had, had, to, use, the, south, side, because, the, chinese, had, denied, them, a, permit, to, climb, ultimately, the, chinese, refusal, may, have, been, beneficial, to, nepal, s, interests, allowing, the, government, to, showcase,
