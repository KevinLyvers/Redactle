since, the, paleoindian, period, based, on, fluted, stone, points, found, in, western, el, salvador, archaeological, knowledge, of, pre, columbian, civilisation, in, el, salvador, is, poor, due, to, its, high, population, density, limiting, excavation, as, well, as, volcanic, eruptions, blanketing, potential, archaeological, sites, this, lack, of, knowledge, particularly, effects, the, preclassic, period, and, earlier, a, notable, archaeological, site, in, western, el, salvador, is, chalchuapa, which, was, first, settled, around, 1200, bc, and, became, a, major, urban, settlement, on, the, periphery, of, the, maya, civilization, during, the, preclassic, period, and, was, heavily, involved, in, the, trading, of, valuable, items, like, ceramics, obsidian, cacao, and, hematite, the, settlement, was, heavily, damaged, around, 430, ad, by, a, volcanic, eruption, after, which, it, never, regained, its, former, prominence, another, major, pre, columbian, settlement, is, cara,

territory, up, until, european, contact, the, term, cuzcatleco, is, commonly, used, to, identify, someone, of, salvadoran, heritage, although, the, majority, of, the, eastern, population, has, an, indigenous, heritage, of, lenca, origin, as, do, their, place, names, such, as, intipuca, chirilagua, and, lolotique, most, of, the, archaeological, sites, in, western, el, salvador, such, as, lago, de, guija, and, joya, de, ceren, indicate, a, pre, columbian, mayan, culture, cihuatan, shows, signs, of, material, trade, with, northern, nahua, culture, eastern, mayan, and, lenca, culture, and,

demonstrates, links, to, the, mayan, site, of, copan, in, western, honduras, as, well, as, the, previously, mentioned, sites, in, chalchuapa, and, cara, sucia, in, western, el, salvador, an, investigation, of, the, site, of, la, laguna, in, usulutan, has, also, produced, copador, items, that, link, it, to, the, lenca, maya, trade, route, by, 1521, the, indigenous, population, of, the, mesoamerican, area, had, been, drastically, reduced, by, the, smallpox, epidemic, that, was, spreading, throughout, the, territory, although, it, had, not, yet, reached, pandemic, levels, in, cuzcatl, n, or, the, northern, portion, managuara, the, first, known, visit, by, spaniards, to, what, is, now, salvadoran, territory, was, made, by, the, admiral, andr, s, ni, o, who, led, an, expedition, to, central, america, he, disembarked, in, the, gulf, of, fonseca, on, 31, may, 1522, at, meanguera, island, naming, it, petronila, and, then, traversed, to, jiquilisco, bay, on, the, mouth, of, lempa, river, the, first, indigenous, people, to, have, contact, with, the, spanish, were, the, lenca, of, eastern, el, salvador, in, 1524, after, participating, in, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, pedro, de, alvarado, his, brother, gonzalo, and, their, men, crossed, the, rio, paz, southward, into, cuzcatlec, territory, upon, their, arrival, spaniards, were, disappointed, to, discover, that, the, pipil, had, little, gold, compared, to, what, they, had, found, in, guatemala, or, mexico, the, small, amount, of, gold, that, was, available, had, to, be, panned, so, that, it, could, be, obtained, eventually, the, spaniards, recognized, the, richness, of, the, land, s, volcanic, soil, following, this, discovery, the, spanish, crown, began, granting, land, based, on, the, terms, of, the, encomienda, system, pedro, alvarado, led, the, first, incursion, to, extend, their, dominion, to, the, domain, of, cuzcatlan, in, june, 1524, when, he, arrived, at, the, borders, of, the, kingdom, he, saw, that, civilians, had, been, evacuated, cuzcatlec, warriors, moved, to, the, coastal, city, of, acajutla, and, waited, for, alvarado, and, his, forces, alvarado, approached, confident, that, the, result, would, be, similar, to, what, occurred, in, mexico, and, guatemala, he, thought, he, would, easily, deal, with, this, new, indigenous, force, since, the, mexican, allies, on, his, side, and, the, pipil, spoke, a, similar, language, alvarado, described, the, cuzcatlec, soldiers, as, having, shields, decorated, with, colourful, exotic, feathers, a, vest, like, armour, made, of, three, inch, cotton, which, arrows, could, not, penetrate, and, long, spears, both, armies, suffered, many, casualties, with, a, wounded, alvarado, retreating, and, losing, a, lot, of, his, men, especially, among, the, mexican, indian, auxiliaries, once, his, army, had, regrouped, alvarado, decided, to, head, to, the, cuzcatlan, capital, and, again, faced, armed, cuzcatlec, wounded, unable, to, fight, and, hiding, in, the, cliffs, alvarado, sent, his, spanish, men, on, their, horses, to, approach, the, cuzcatlec, to, see, if, they, would, fear, the, horses, but, they, did, not, retreat, alvarado, recalls, in, his, letters, to, hern, n, cort, s, the, cuzcatlec, attacked, again, and, on, this, occasion, stole, spanish, weaponry, alvarado, retreated, and, sent, mexican, messengers, to, demand, that, the, cuzcatlec, warriors, return, the, stolen, weapons, and, surrender, to, their, opponent, s, king, the, cuzcatlec, responded, with, the, famous, response, if, you, want, your, weapons, come, get, them, as, days, passed, alvarado, fearing, an, ambush, sent, more, mexican, messengers, to, negotiate, but, these, messengers, never, came, back, and, were, presumably, executed, the, spanish, efforts, were, firmly, resisted, by, pipil, and, their, mayan, speaking, neighbours, they, defeated, the, spaniards, and, what, was, left, of, their, tlaxcalan, allies, forcing, them, to, withdraw, to, guatemala, after, being, wounded, alvarado, abandoned, the, war, and, appointed, his, brother, gonzalo, de, alvarado, to, continue, the, task, two, subsequent, expeditions, the, first, in, 1525, followed, by, a, smaller, group, in, 1528, brought, the, pipil, under, spanish, control, since, the, pipil, also, were, weakened, by, a, regional, epidemic, of, smallpox, in, 1525, the, conquest, of, cuzcatl, n, was, completed, and, the, city, of, san, salvador, was, established, the, spanish, faced, much, resistance, from, the, pipil, and, were, not, able, to, reach, eastern, el, salvador, the, area, of, the, lencas, in, 1526, the, spanish, founded, the, garrison, town, of, san, miguel, in, northern, managuara, territory, of, the, lenca, headed, by, another, explorer, and, conquistador, luis, de, moscoso, alvarado, nephew, of, pedro, alvarado, oral, history, holds, that, a, maya, lenca, crown, princess, antu, silan, ulap, i, organized, resistance, to, the, conquistadors, the, commonwealth, of, the, lenca, was, alarmed, by, de, moscoso, s, invasion, and, antu, silan, travelled, from, village, to, village, uniting, all, the, lenca, towns, in, present, day, el, salvador, and, honduras, against, the, spaniards, through, surprise, attacks, and, overwhelming, numbers, they, were, able, to, drive, the, spanish, out, of, san, miguel, and, destroy, the, garrison, for, ten, years, the, lencas, prevented, the, spanish, from, building, a, permanent, settlement, then, the, spanish, returned, with, more, soldiers, including, about, 2, 000, forced, conscripts, from, indigenous, communities, in, guatemala, they, pursued, the, lenca, leaders, further, up, into, the, mountains, of, intibuc, antu, silan, ulap, eventually, handed, over, control, of, the, lenca, resistance, to, lempira, also, called, empira, lempira, was, noteworthy, among, indigenous, leaders, in, that, he, mocked, the, spanish, by, wearing, their, clothes, after, capturing, them, and, using, their, weapons, captured, in, battle, lempira, fought, in, command, of, thousands, of, lenca, forces, for, six, more, years, in, managuara, until, he, was, killed, in, battle, the, remaining, lenca, forces, retreated, into, the, hills, the, spanish, were, then, able, to, rebuild, their, garrison, town, of, san, miguel, in, 1537, during, the, colonial, period, san, salvador, and, san, miguel, were, part, of, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, also, known, as, the, kingdom, of, guatemala, spanish, reino, de, guatemala, created, in, 1609, as, an, administrative, division, of, new, spain, the, salvadoran, territory, was, administered, by, the, mayor, of, sonsonate, with, san, salvador, being, established, as, an, intendencia, in, 1786, in, 1811, a, combination, of, internal, and, external, factors, motivated, central, american, elites, to, attempt, to, gain, independence, from, the, spanish, crown, the, most, important, internal, factors, were, the, desire, of, local, elites, to, control, the, country, s, affairs, free, of, involvement, from, spanish, authorities, and, the, long, standing, creole, aspiration, for, independence, the, main, external, factors, motivating, the, independence, movement, were, the, success, of, the, french, and, american, revolutions, in, the, 18th, century, and, the, weakening, of, the, spanish, crown, s, military, power, as, a, result, of, the, napoleonic, wars, with, the, resulting, inability, to, control, its, colonies, effectively, in, november, 1811, salvadoran, priest, jos, mat, as, delgado, rang, the, bells, of, iglesia, la, merced, in, san, salvador, calling, for, insurrection, and, launching, the, 1811, independence, movement, this, insurrection, was, suppressed, and, many, of, its, leaders, were, arrested, and, served, sentences, in, jail, another, insurrection, was, launched, in, 1814, which, was, also, suppressed, in, 1821, in, light, of, unrest, in, guatemala, spanish, authorities, capitulated, and, signed, the, act, of, independence, of, central, america, which, released, all, of, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, comprising, current, territories, of, guatemala, el, salvador, honduras, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, and, the, mexican, state, of, chiapas, from, spanish, rule, and, declared, its, independence, in, 1821, el, salvador, joined, costa, rica, guatemala, honduras, and, nicaragua, in, a, union, named, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, in, early, 1822, the, authorities, of, the, newly, independent, central, american, provinces, meeting, in, guatemala, city, voted, to, join, the, newly, constituted, first, mexican, empire, under, agust, n, de, iturbide, el, salvador, resisted, insisting, on, autonomy, for, the, central, american, countries, a, mexican, military, detachment, marched, to, san, salvador, and, suppressed, dissent, but, with, the, fall, of, iturbide, on, 19, march, 1823, the, army, decamped, back, to, mexico, shortly, thereafter, the, authorities, of, the, provinces, revoked, the, vote, to, join, mexico, deciding, instead, to, form, a, federal, union, of, the, five, remaining, provinces, chiapas, permanently, joined, mexico, at, this, juncture, known, as, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, el, salvador, declared, its, independence, from, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, on, 30, january, 1841, el, salvador, joined, honduras, and, nicaragua, in, 1896, to, form, the, greater, republic, of, central, america, which, dissolved, in, 1898, after, the, mid, 19th, century, the, economy, was, based, on, coffee, growing, as, the, world, market, for, indigo, withered, away, the, economy, prospered, or, suffered, as, the, world, coffee, price, fluctuated, the, enormous, profits, that, coffee, yielded, as, a, monoculture, export, served, as, an, impetus, for, the, concentration, of, land, into, the, hands, of, an, oligarchy, of, just, a, few, families, throughout, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, a, succession, of, presidents, from, the, ranks, of, the, salvadoran, oligarchy, nominally, both, conservative, and, liberal, generally, agreed, on, the, promotion, of, coffee, as, the, predominant, cash, crop, the, development, of, infrastructure, railroads, and, port, facilities, primarily, in, support, of, the, coffee, trade, the, elimination, of, communal, landholdings, to, facilitate, further, coffee, production, the, passage, of, anti, vagrancy, laws, to, ensure, that, displaced, campesinos, and, other, rural,

against, guatemala, until, 1913, el, salvador, was, politically, stable, with, undercurrents, of, popular, discontent, when, president, manuel, enrique, araujo, was, killed, in, 1913, many, hypotheses, were, advanced, for, the, political, motive, of, his, murder, araujo, s, administration, was, followed, by, the, melendez, quinonez, dynasty, that, lasted, from, 1913, to, 1927, pio, romero, bosque, ex, minister, of, the, government, and, a, trusted, collaborator, of, the, dynasty, succeeded, president, jorge, mel, ndez, and, in, 1930, announced, free, elections, in, which, arturo, araujo, came, to, power, on, 1, march, 1931, in, what, was, considered, the, country, s, first, freely, contested, election, his, government, lasted, only, nine, months, before, it, was, overthrown, by, junior, military, officers, who, accused, his, labor, party, of, lacking, political, and, governmental, experience, and, of, using, its, government, offices, inefficiently, president, araujo, faced, general, popular, discontent, as, the, people, had, expected, economic, reforms, and, the, redistribution, of, land, there, were, demonstrations, in, front, of, the, national, palace, from, the, first, week, of, his, administration, his, vice, president, and, minister, of, war, was, general, maximiliano, hern, ndez, mart, nez, in, december, 1931, a, coup, d, tat, was, organized,

later, that, night, after, hours, of, fighting, the, badly, outnumbered, defenders, surrendered, to, rebel, forces, the, directorate, composed, of, officers, hid, behind, a, shadowy, figure, a, rich, anti, communist, banker, called, rodolfo, duke, and, later, installed, the, vice, president, mart, nez, as, president, the, revolt, was, probably, caused, by, the, army, s, discontent, at, not, having, been, paid, by, president, araujo, for, some, months, araujo, left, the, national, palace, and, unsuccessfully, tried, to, organize, forces, to, defeat, the, revolt, the, u, s, minister, in, el, salvador, met, with, the, directorate, and, later, recognized, the, government, of, mart, nez, which, agreed, to, hold, presidential, elections, he, resigned, six, months, prior, to, running, for, re, election, winning, back, the, presidency, as, the, only, candidate, on, the, ballot, he, ruled, from, 1935, to, 1939, then, from, 1939, to, 1943, he, began, a, fourth, term, in, 1944, but, resigned, in, may, after, a, general, strike, mart, nez, had, said, he, was, going, to, respect, the, constitution, which, stipulated, he, could, not, be, re, elected, but, he, refused, to, keep, his, promise, beginning, in, january, 1932, there, was, brutal, suppression, of, a, rural, revolt, known, as, la, matanza, in, the, unstable, political, climate, of, the, previous, few, years, social, activist, and, revolutionary, leader, farabundo, mart, helped, found, the, communist, party, of, central, america, and, led, a, communist, alternative, to, the, red, cross, called, international, red, aid, serving, as, one, of, its, representatives, their, goal, was, to, help, poor, and, underprivileged, salvadorans, through, the, use, of, marxist, leninist, ideology, in, december, 1930, at, the, height, of, the, country, s, economic, and, social, depression, mart, was, once, again, exiled, because, of, his, popularity, among, the, nation, s, poor, and, rumours, of, his, upcoming, nomination, for, president, the, following, year, once, araujo, was, elected, president, in, 1931, mart, returned, to, el, salvador, and, along, with, alfonso, luna, and, mario, zapata, began, the, movement, that, was, later, truncated, by, the, military, on, 22, january, 1932, thousands, of, poorly, armed, peasants, in, the, western, part, of, el, salvador, revolted, against, the, government, and, mart, nez, the, rebellion, occurred, amid, widespread, unrest, over, suppression, of, democratic, political, freedoms, following, the, cancelation, of, the, results, of, the, 1932, legislative, election, the, rebels, were, led, by, feliciano, ama, and, farabundo, mart, and, were, largely, composed, of, indigenous, people, and, communists, the, rebellion, made, gains, initially, capturing, several, towns, and, cities, across, the, western, part, of, the, country, killing, an, estimated, 2, 000, people, the, government, suppressed, the, rebellion, brutally, killing, between, 10, 000, and, 40, 000, people, mostly, pipil, peasants, many, of, the, rebellion, s, leaders, including, ama, and, mart, were, captured, and, executed, historically, the, high, salvadoran, population, density, has, contributed, to, tensions, with, neighbouring, honduras, as, land, poor, salvadorans, emigrated, to, less, densely, populated, honduras, and, established, themselves, as, squatters, on, unused, or, underused, land, this, phenomenon, was, a, major, cause, of, the, 1969, football, war, between, the, two, countries, as, many, as, 130, 000, salvadorans, were, forcibly, expelled, or, fled, from, honduras, the, christian, democratic, party, pdc, and, the, national, conciliation, party, pcn, were, active, in, salvadoran, politics, from, 1960, until, 2011, when, they, were, disbanded, by, the, supreme, court, because, they, had, failed, to, win, enough, votes, in, the, 2004, presidential, election, both, parties, have, since, reconstituted, they, share, common, ideals, but, one, represents, the, middle, class, and, the, latter, the, interests, of, the, salvadoran, military, pdc, leader, jos, napole, n, duarte, was, the, mayor, of, san, salvador, from, 1964, to, 1970, winning, three, elections, during, the, regime, of, pcn, president, julio, adalberto, rivera, carballo, who, allowed, free, elections, for, mayors, and, the, national, assembly, duarte, later, ran, for, president,
