its, name, means, toucan, s, beak, tuk, for, toucan, and, ti, for, beak, it, runs, from, south, to, north, for, about, 2, 450, km, 1, 520, mi, it, is, not, really, a, branch, of, the, amazon, river, since, its, waters, flow, into, the, atlantic, ocean, alongside, those, of, the, amazon, it, flows, through, four, brazilian, states, goi, s, tocantins, maranh, o, and, par, and, gives, its, name, to, one, of, brazil, s, newest, states, formed, in, 1988, from, what, was, until, then, the, northern, portion, of, goi, s, the, tocantins, is, one, of, the, largest, clearwater, rivers, in, south, america, it, rises, in, the, mountainous, district, known, as, the, pireneus, west, of, the, federal, district, but, its, western, tributary, the, araguaia, river, has, its, extreme, southern, headwaters, on, the, slopes, of, the, serra, dos, caiap, s, the, araguaia, flows, 1, 670, km, 1, 040, mi, before, its, confluence, with, the, tocantins, to, which, it, is, almost, equal, in, volume, besides, its, main, tributary, the, rio, das, mortes, the, araguaia, has, twenty, smaller, branches, offering, many, miles, of, canoe, navigation, in, finding, its, way, to, the, lowlands, it, breaks, frequently, into, waterfalls, and, rapids, or, winds, violently, through, rocky, gorges, until, at, a, point, about, 160, km, 99, mi, above, its, junction, with, the, tocantins, it, saws, its, way, across, a, rocky, dyke, for, 20, km, 12, mi, in, roaring, cataracts, two, other, tributaries, called, the, maranh, o, and, paranatinga, collect, an, immense, volume, of, water, from, the, highlands, which, surround, them, especially, on, the, south, and, south, east, between, the, latter, and, the, confluence, with, the, araguaia, the, tocantins, is, occasionally, obstructed, by, rocky, barriers, which, cross, it, almost, at, a, right, angle, the, tocantins, basin, which, includes, the, araguaia, river, is, the, home, of, several, large, aquatic, mammals, such, as, amazonian, manatee, araguaian, river, dolphin, and, tucuxi, and, larger, reptiles, such, as, black, caiman, spectacled, caiman, and, yellow, spotted, river, turtle, the, tocantins, river, basin, has, a, high, richness, of, fish, species, although, it, is, relatively, low, by, amazon, basin, standards, more, than, 350, fish, species, have, been, registered, including, more, than, 175, endemics, the, most, species, rich, families, are, characidae, tetras, and, allies, loricariidae, pleco, catfish, and, allies, and, rivulidae, south, american, killifish, while, most, species, essentially, are, of, amazonian, origin, there, are, also, some, showing, a, connection, with, the, paran, and, s, o, francisco, rivers, the, tocantins, and, these, two, rivers, flow, in, different, directions, but, all, have, their, source, in, the, brazilian, plateau, in, a, region, where, a, low, watershed, allows, some, exchange, between, them, there, are, several, fish, species, that, migrate, along, the, tocantins, to, spawn, but, this, has, been, restricted, by, the, dams, following, the, construction, of, the, massive, tucuru, dam, the, flow, of, the, river, changed, some, species, have, been, adversely, affected, and, there, has, been, a, substantial, reduction, in, species, richness, in, parts, of, the, river, the, s, o, domingos, karst, in, the, upper, tocantins, basin, is, home, to, an, unusually, high, number, of, cavefish, species, more, than, any, other, region, in, the, americas, ancistrus, cryptophthalmus, several, ituglanis, species, pimelodella, spelaea, aspidoras, mephisto, an, undescribed, cetopsorhamdia, species, and, eigenmannia, vicentespelaea, the, last, is, the, only, known, cave, adapted, knifefish, and, one, of, only, two, known, non, catfish, in, caves, of, the, south, american, mainland, the, other, is, the, characid, stygichthys, typhlops, in, its, lower, reaches, the, tocantins, separates, the, tocantins, araguaia, maranh, o, moist, forests, ecoregion, to, the, east, from, the, xingu, tocantins, araguaia, moist, forests, ecoregion, to, the, west, it, acts, as, a, barrier, that, prevents, dispersal, of, flora, and, fauna, between, these, ecoregions, downstream, from, the, araguaia, confluence, in, the, state, of, par, the, river, used, to, have, many, cataracts, and, rapids, but, they, were, flooded, in, the, early, 1980s, by, the, artificial, lake, created, by, the, tucuru, dam, one, of, the, world, s, largest, when, the, second, phase, of, the, tucuru, project, was, completed, on, november, 30, 2010, a, system, of, locks, called, eclusas, do, tucuru, was, established, with, the, goal, of, making, a, long, extension, of, the, river, navigable, in, total, there, are, seven, dams, on, the, river, serra, da, mesa, dam, cana, brava, dam, s, o, salvador, dam, peixe, angical, dam, luiz, eduardo, magalh, es, lajeado, dam, estreito, dam, and, tucuru, dam, of, which, the, largest, are, the, tucuru, and, the, serra, da, mesa, dam, the, flat, broad, valleys, composed, of, sand, and, clay, of, both, the, tocantins, and, its, araguaia, branch, are, overlooked, by, steep, bluffs, they, are, the, margins, of, the, great, sandstone, plateaus, from, 300, to, 600, metres, 980, to, 1, 970, ft, elevation, above, sea, level, through, which, the, rivers, have, eroded, their, deep, beds, around, the, estuary, of, the, tocantins, the, great, plateau, has, disappeared, having, been, replaced, by, a, part, of, the, forest, covered, half, submerged, alluvial, plain, which, extends, far, to, the, north, east, and, west, the, par, river, generally, called, one, of, the, mouths, of, the, amazon, is, only, the, lower, reach, of, the, tocantins, if, any, portion, of, the, waters, of, the, amazon, runs, round, the, southern, side, of, the, large, island, of, maraj, into, the, river, para, it, is, only, through, tortuous, natural, canals, which, are, in, no, sense, outflow, channels, of, the, amazon, the, tocantins, river, records, a, mean, discharge, rate, of, 13, 598, m, 3, s, 480, 200, cu, ft, s, and, a, specific, discharge, rate, of, 14, 4, l, s, km, 2, 1, 32, cu, ft, s, sq, mi, the, sub, basins, have, the, following, specific, discharge, rates, tocantins, 11, l, s, km, 2, or, 1, 0, cu, ft, s, sq, mi, araguaia, 16, l, s, km, 2, or, 1, 5, cu, ft, s, sq, mi, par, 17, l, s, km, 2, or, 1, 6, cu, ft, s, sq, mi, and, guam, 21, l,
