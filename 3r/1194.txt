by, a, roughly, 15, kilometer, 9, mi, expanse, of, el, vila, national, park, the, valley, is, relatively, small, and, quite, irregular, and, the, altitude, varies, from, between, 870, and, 1, 043, meters, 2, 854, and, 3, 422, ft, above, sea, level, the, historic, center, lies, at, about, 900, meters, 3, 000, feet, above, sea, level, this, along, with, the, rapid, population, growth, has, profoundly, influenced, the, urban, development, of, the, city, the, most, elevated, point, of, the, capital, district, wherein, the, city, is, located, is, the, pico, el, vila, which, rises, to, 2, 159, meters, 7, 083, feet, the, main, body, of, water, in, caracas, is, the, guaire, river, which, flows, across, the, city, and, empties, into, the, tuy, river, which, is, also, fed, by, the, el, valle, and, san, pedro, rivers, in, addition, to, numerous, streams, which, descend, from, el, vila, the, la, mariposa, and, camatagua, reservoirs, provide, water, to, the, city, the, city, is, occasionally, subject, to, earthquakes, notably, in, 1641, and, 1967, geologically, caracas, was, formed, in, the, late, cretaceous, period, with, much, of, the, rest, of, the, caribbean, and, sits, on, what, is, mostly, metamorphic, rock, deformation, of, the, land, in, this, period, formed, the, region, under, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, caracas, has, a, tropical, savanna, climate, aw, but, also, exhibits, traits, of, a, subtropical, highland, climate, cfb, due, to, its, elevated, location, within, the, venezuelan, coastal, range, maritime, andes, caracas, precipitation, varies, between, 900, and, 1, 300, millimeters, 35, and, 51, inches, annual, in, the, city, proper, to, 2, 000, millimeters, 79, inches, in, some, parts, of, the, mountain, range, while, caracas, is, within, the, tropics, due, to, its, altitude, temperatures, are, cooler, compared, to, other, locations, with, a, typical, tropical, savanna, climate, the, annual, average, temperature, is, approximately, 23, 4, c, 74, f, with, the, average, of, the, coldest, month, january, 21, 7, c, 71, f, and, the, average, of, the, warmest, month, may, 24, 5, c, 76, f, which, gives, a, small, annual, thermal, amplitude, of, 2, 8, c, 5, 0, f, in, the, months, of, december, and, january, abundant, fog, may, appear, in, addition, to, a, sudden, nightly, drop, in, temperature, until, reaching, 8, c, 46, f, this, peculiar, weather, is, known, by, the, natives, of, caracas, as, the, pacheco, in, addition, nightly, temperatures, at, any, time, of, the, year, are, much, 7, to, 11, c, lower, than, daytime, highs, and, usually, do, not, remain, above, 24, c, 75, f, resulting, in, very, pleasant, evening, temperatures, hailstorms, appear, in, caracas, although, only, on, rare, occasions, electrical, storms, are, much, more, frequent, especially, between, june, and, october, due, to, the, city, being, in, a, closed, valley, and, the, orographic, action, of, cerro, el, vila, the, hydrographic, network, of, the, city, of, caracas, is, made, up, of, the, guaire, river, basin, which, is, a, sub, basin, of, the, tuy, river, this, basin, crosses, the, valley, where, the, city, is, located, from, west, to, east, las, adjuntas, petare, it, covers, about, 655, square, kilometers, about, 45, km, long, and, about, 15, km, wide, has, a, rectangular, shape, the, basin, is, formed, by, the, caracas, valley, which, is, relatively, high, narrow, and, long, surrounded, by, the, high, and, steep, cordillera, de, la, costa, which, runs, parallel, to, the, litoral, among, the, characteristics, of, the, hydrographic, network, associated, with, the, city, of, caracas, is, the, high, degree, of, contamination, present, in, the, lower, parts, of, the, guaire, river, due, to, its, tributaries, having, been, used, for, sewage, collection, since, 1874, during, the, government, of, antonio, guzm, n, blanco, until, today, the, level, of, contamination, is, such, that, it, does, not, allow, the, maintenance, of, the, life, of, the, species, that, once, populated, the, basin, and, it, has, become, extinct, or, has, been, restricted, to, the, highest, areas, of, the, basin, mainly, within, the, boundaries, of, the, national, park, avila, awareness, for, the, recovery, of, the, basin, has, recently, begun, however, much, remains, to, be, done, before, results, can, be, observed, among, the, main, rivers, and, streams, that, make, up, the, basin, are, in, its, northern, slope, san, pedro, river, macarao, river, quebrada, caroata, catuche, river, anauco, river, chacaito, river, tocome, river, caurimare, river, on, its, southern, slope, we, find, that, among, the, main, tributaries, are, el, valle, river, quebrada, baruta, and, quebrada, la, guairita, in, the, upper, part, of, the, basin, there, are, two, reservoirs, with, the, purpose, of, supplying, water, to, the, western, part, of, the, city, these, are, the, macarao, dam, and, the, la, mariposa, reservoir, caracas, shares, commonalities, with, many, latin, american, cities, densely, populated, and, with, limited, space, because, it, is, surrounded, by, mountains, because, of, this, the, city, has, grown, vertically, a, very, striking, aspect, is, the, number, of, people, living, in, substandard, housing, built, on, the, mountain, slopes, surrounding, the, city, this, type, of, housing, is, called, ranchos, built, improvised, without, any, official, planning, with, deficiencies, and, inadequate, materials, marking, a, difference, between, those, who, live, in, the, valley, proper, 45, of, the, population, in, 25, of, the, urban, area, lives, in, these, settlements, the, city, center, developed, around, a, small, historic, center, represents, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, total, area, of, the, city, which, has, spread, along, the, valley, and, has, also, been, connected, in, recent, years, with, satellite, cities, in, the, states, of, miranda, and, la, guaira, creating, a, major, metropolitan, area, known, as, gran, caracas, the, city, s, rapid, population, growth, has, resulted, in, increasing, traffic, congestion, to, this, end, the, subway, transportation, system, metro, de, caracas, has, been, progressively, expanded, and, is, currently, linked, to, the, los, teques, metro, and, in, the, future, to, the, guarenas, guatire, metro, system, the, ezequiel, zamora, central, railway, system, also, links, the, communities, of, charallave, and, c, a, de, los, valles, del, tuy, with, the, subway, transportation, of, the, capital, city, some, areas, of, the, city, have, a, grid, layout, either, inherited, from, the, colony, or, developed, during, the, urban, projects, of, the, 20th, century, other, areas, built, on, the, mountain, slopes, do, not, follow, this, pattern, but, adapt, to, the, irregularities, of, the, terrain, these, elevated, areas, enjoy, a, temperate, temperature, throughout, the, year, according, to, the, population, census, of, 2011, the, caracas, proper, distrito, capital, is, over, 1, 9, million, inhabitants, while, that, of, the, metropolitan, district, of, caracas, is, estimated, at, 2, 9, million, as, of, 2011, the, majority, of, the, population, is, mixed, race, typically, with, varying, degrees, of, european, indigenous, african, and, occasional, asian, ancestry, there, is, a, noteworthy, afro, venezuelan, community, additionally, the, city, has, a, large, number, of, both, european, venezuelans, and, asian, venezuelans, who, descend, from, the, massive, influx, of, various, immigrants, venezuela, received, from, all, across, eurasia, during, the, 20th, century, in, particular, are, descendants, of, spaniards, portuguese, italians, serbs, chinese, colombians, germans, syrians, and, lebanese, people, in, 2020, the, poorest, 55, of, the, caracas, population, lived, on, about, a, third, of, its, land, in, poorly, planned, slums, that, are, generally, dangerous, to, live, in, and, access, caracas, has, exceeded, the, administrative, limits, of, its, perimeter, due, to, accelerated, population, growth, so, that, its, most, suitable, demographic, study, territory, is, the, metropolitan, district, or, amc, according, to, 2011, calculations, by, the, national, institute, of, statistics, the, metropolitan, city, had, a, population, for, the, 2011, census, of, 2, 923, 959, inhabitants, the, metropolitan, district, represents, less, than, 1, of, the, national, territory, and, is, home, to, one, fifteenth, of, the, total, population, of, the, country, in, percentage, numbers, 9, 2, of, the, nation, s, total, population, lives, in, the, five, capital, municipalities, out, of, the, 335, municipalities, that, comprise, the, country, the, region, is, called, greater, caracas, or, metropolitan, region, of, caracas, rmc, satellite, cities, or, adjacent, bedrooms, the, altos, mirandinos, the, central, coast, of, la, guaira, guarenas, guatire, and, the, valles, del, tuy, this, agglomeration, had, an, estimated, population, of, 4, 3, million, inhabitants, in, 2011, in, the, 20th, century, an, exodus, of, the, peasantry, to, the, capital, and, other, cities, intensified, motivated, by, a, search, for, improvements, in, their, quality, of, life, this, led, to, depopulation, of, the, rural, areas, of, the, country, and, the, demographic, saturation, of, the, centers, this, saturation, caused, the, expansion, of, marginal, areas, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, however, the, lowest, unemployment, rates, in, the, entire, country, correspond, precisely, to, the, metropolitan, area, of, caracas, in, 1936, the, total, population, of, venezuela, had, been, equal, to, the, estimated, population, of, greater, caracas, for, the, year, 2000, almost, 4, million, inhabitants, from, 1936, to, 1990, caracas, multiplied, its, population, although, far, less, than, any, other, major, city, in, the, country, such, as, valencia, which, in, the, same, period, of, time, multiplied, its, population, almost, 25, times, between, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, after, the, second, world, war, a, growing, wave, of, european, immigrants, began, mostly, spanish, portuguese, and, italians, and, in, other, magnitudes, communities, of, germans, colonia, tovar, french, english, serbs, and, jews, were, established, new, developments, in, caracas, were, populated, mainly, by, these, european, immigrants, such, as, la, florida, and, altamira, during, the, 1960s, president, r, mulo, betancourt, followed, the, same, policy, as, the, marcos, p, rez, jim, nez, government, promoting, immigration, especially, from, latin, america, and, from, other, parts, of, the, world, these, policies, were, maintained, until, the, late, 1980s, with, a, notable, influx, of, argentines, uruguayans, chileans, cubans, peruvians, ecuadorians, chinese, and, arabs, towards, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, immigration, was, marked, by, a, strong, exodus, of, colombians, the, multiethnic, cultural, and, racial, mix, has, marked, the, city, throughout, history, its, ethnic, composition, is, very, diverse, venezuela, and, its, capital, caracas, have, been, reported, to, both, have, among, the, highest, per, capita, murder, rates, in, the, world, in, 2010, caracas, had, the, highest, murder, rate, in, the, world, having, more, deaths, than, baghdad, during, the, iraq, war, and,

this, statistic, is, based, upon, a, fixed, currency, exchange, rate, of, 2003, and, might, not, be, completely, realistic, due, to, the, elevated, inflation, rates, of, the, last, several, years, in,
