the, mojave, desert, m, o, h, v, i, m, mohave, hayikwiir, mat, aar, spanish, desierto, de, mojave, is, a, desert, in, the, rain, shadow, of, the, southern, sierra, nevada, mountains, and, transverse, ranges, in, the, southwestern, united, states, named, for, the, indigenous, mohave, people, it, is, located, primarily, in, southeastern, california, and, southwestern, nevada, with, small, portions, extending, into, arizona, and, utah, the, mojave, desert, together, with, the, sonoran, chihuahuan, and, great, basin, deserts, form, a, larger, north, american, desert, of, these, the, mojave, is, the, smallest, and, driest, it, displays, typical, basin, and, range, topography, generally, having, a, pattern, of, a, series, of, parallel, mountain, ranges, and, valleys, it, is, also, the, site, of, death, valley, which, is, the, lowest, elevation, in, north, america, the, mojave, desert, is, often, colloquially, called, the, high, desert, as, most, of, it, lies, between, 2, 000, and, 4, 000, feet, 610, and, 1, 220, m, it, supports, a, diversity, of, flora, and, fauna, the, 54, 000, sq, mi, 140, 000, km, 2, desert, supports, a, number, of, human, activities, including, recreation, ranching, and, military, training, the, mojave, desert, also, contains, various, silver, tungsten, iron, and, gold, deposits, 124, the, spelling, mojave, originates, from, the, spanish, language, while, the, spelling, mohave, comes, from, modern, english, both, are, used, today, although, the, mojave, tribal, nation, officially, uses, the, spelling, mojave, mojave, is, a, shortened, form, of, hamakhaave, an, endonym, in, their, native, language, which, means, beside, the, water, the, mojave, desert, is, a, desert, bordered, to, the, west, by, the, sierra, nevada, mountain, range, and, the, california, montane, chaparral, and, woodlands, and, to, the, south, and, east, by, the, sonoran, desert, the, boundaries, to, the, east, of, the, mojave, desert, are, less, distinctive, than, the, other, boundaries, because, there, is, no, presence, of, an, indicator, species, such, as, the, joshua, tree, yucca, brevifolia, which, is, endemic, to, the, mojave, desert, the, mojave, desert, is, distinguished, from, the, sonoran, desert, and, other, deserts, adjacent, to, it, by, its, warm, temperate, climate, as, well, as, flora, and, fauna, such, as, ironwood, olneya, tesota, blue, palo, verde, parkinsonia, florida, chuparosa, justicia, californica, spiny, menodora, menodora, spinescens, desert, senna, cassia, armata, california, dalea, psorothamnus, arborescens, california, fan, palm, washingtonia, filifera, and, goldenhead, acamptopappus, shockleyi, along, with, these, other, factors, these, plants, differentiate, the, mojave, from, the, nearby, sonoran, desert, the, mojave, desert, is, bordered, by, the, san, andreas, fault, to, the, southwest, and, the, garlock, fault, to, the, north, the, mountains, elevated, along, the, length, of, the, san, andreas, fault, provide, a, clear, border, between, the, mojave, desert, and, the, coastal, regions, to, the, west, the, garlock, fault, separates, the, mojave, desert, from, the, sierra, nevada, and, tehachapi, mountains, which, provide, a, natural, border, to, the, mojave, desert, there, are, also, abundant, alluvial, fans, which, are, called, bajadas, that, form, around, the, mountains, within, the, mojave, desert, and, extend, down, toward, the, low, altitude, basins, which, contain, dried, lake, beds, called, playas, where, water, generally, collects, and, evaporates, leaving, large, volumes, of, salt, these, playas, include, rogers, dry, lake, and, china, lake, dry, lakes, are, a, noted, feature, of, the, mojave, landscape, the, mojave, desert, is, also, home, to, the, devils, playground, about, 40, miles, 64, km, of, dunes, and, salt, flats, going, in, a, northwest, southeasterly, direction, the, devil, s, playground, is, a, part, of, the, mojave, national, preserve, and, is, between, the, town, of, baker, california, and, providence, mountains, the, cronese, mountains, are, within, the, devil, s, playground, there, are, very, few, surface, rivers, in, the, mojave, desert, but, two, major, rivers, generally, flow, underground, one, is, the, intermittent, mojave, river, which, begins, in, the, san, bernardino, mountains, and, disappears, underground, in, the, mojave, desert, the, other, is, the, amargosa, river, which, flows, partly, underground, through, the, mojave, desert, along, a, southward, path, the, manix, mojave, and, the, little, mojave, lakes, are, all, large, but, shallow, 7, soda, lake, is, the, principal, saline, basin, of, the, mojave, desert, natural, springs, are, typically, rare, throughout, the, mojave, desert, 19, but, there, are, two, notable, springs, ash, meadows, and, oasis, valley, ash, meadows, is, formed, from, several, other, springs, which, all, draw, from, deep, underground, oasis, valley, draws, from, the, nearby, amargosa, river, extremes, in, temperatures, throughout, the, seasons, characterize, the, climate, of, the, mojave, desert, freezing, temperatures, as, well, as, strong, winds, are, not, uncommon, in, the, winter, as, well, as, precipitation, such, as, rain, and, snow, in, the, mountains, in, contrast, temperatures, above, 100, f, 38, c, are, not, uncommon, during, the, summer, months, there, is, an, annual, average, precipitation, of, 2, to, 6, inches, 51, to, 152, mm, although, regions, at, high, altitudes, such, as, the, portion, of, the, mojave, desert, in, the, san, gabriel, mountains, may, receive, more, rain, most, of, the, precipitation, in, the, mojave, comes, from, the, pacific, cyclonic, storms, that, are, generally, present, passing, eastward, in, november, to, april, such, storms, generally, bring, rain, and, snow, only, in, the, mountainous, regions, as, a, result, of, the, effect, of, the, mountains, which, creates, a, drying, effect, on, its, leeward, slopes, during, the, late, summer, months, there, is, also, the, possibility, of, strong, thunderstorms, which, bring, heavy, showers, or, cloudbursts, these, storms, can, result, in, flash, flooding, the, mojave, desert, has, not, historically, supported, a, fire, regime, because, of, low, fuel, loads, and, connectivity, however, in, the, last, few, decades, invasive, annual, plants, such, as, some, within, the, genera, bromus, schismus, and, brassica, have, facilitated, fires, by, serving, as, a, fuel, bed, this, has, significantly, altered, many, areas, of, the, desert, at, higher, elevations, fire, regimes, are, regular, but, infrequent, while, the, mojave, desert, is, generally, sparsely, populated, it, has, increasingly, become, urbanized, in, recent, years, the, metropolitan, areas, include, las, vegas, the, largest, urban, area, in, the, mojave, and, the, largest, urban, area, in, nevada, with, a, population, of, about, 2, 3, million, st, george, utah, is, the, northeasternmost, metropolitan, area, in, the, mojave, with, a, population, of, around, 180, 000, in, 2020, and, is, located, at, the, convergence, of, the, mojave, great, basin, and, colorado, plateau, the, los, angeles, exurban, area, of, lancaster, palmdale, has, more, than, 400, 000, residents, and, the, victorville, area, to, its, east, has, more, than, 300, 000, residents, smaller, cities, or, micropolitan, areas, in, the, mojave, desert, include, helendale, lake, havasu, city, kingman, laughlin, bullhead, city, and, pahrump, all, have, experienced, rapid, population, growth, since, 1990, the, california, portion, of, the, desert, also, contains, edwards, air, force, base, and, naval, air, weapons, station, china, lake, noted, for, experimental, aviation, and, weapons, projects, the, mojave, desert, has, several, ghost, towns, the, most, significant, are, the, silver, and, copper, mining, town, of, calico, california, and, the, old, railroad, depot, of, kelso, california, some, of, the, other, ghost, towns, are, more, modern, created, when, u, s, route, 66, and, the, lesser, known, u, s, route, 91, were, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, construction, of, interstates, ca, sr, 14, interstate, 15, interstate, 40, ca, sr, 58, ca, sr, 138, us, route, 95, and, us, route, 395, are, the, main, highways, that, traverse, the, mojave, desert, the, rock, that, forms, the, mojave, desert, was, likely, created, under, shallow, water, in, the, precambrian, 21, 115, sedimentary, processes, left, large, deposits, of, limestones, silicates, and, dolomites, during, the, paleozoic, era, the, area, that, is, now, the, mojave, was, again, likely, submerged, under, a, greater, sea, 116, during, the, mesozoic, era, major, tectonic, activities, such, as, thrust, faulting, and, folding, resulted, in, distinctive, shaping, as, well, as, intrusion, 116, during, the, cenozoic, more, tectonic, deformation, occurred, whilst, the, mojave, was, partly, submerged, major, volcanic, activity, is, thought, to, have, occurred, during, the, oligocene, large, downpours, during, the, miocene, likely, significantly, eroded, the, rock, in, the, mojave, and, accelerated, deposition, 116, the, mojave, desert, is, a, source, of, various, minerals, and, metallic, materials, due, to, the, climate, there, is, an, accumulation, of, weathered, bedrock, fine, sand, and, silt, both, sand, and, silt, sediments, becoming, converted, into, colluvium, the, deposits, of, gold, tungsten, and, silver, have, been, mined, frequently, prior, to, the, second, world, war, 124, additionally, there, have, been, deposits, of, copper, tin, lead, zinc, manganese, iron, and, various, radioactive, substances, but, they, have, not, been, mined, for, commercial, use, 124, the, flora, of, the, mojave, desert, consists, of, various, endemic, plant, species, notably, the, joshua, tree, which, is, a, notable, endemic, and, indicator, species, of, the, desert, there, is, more, endemic, flora, in, the, mojave, desert, than, almost, anywhere, in, the, world, mojave, desert, flora, is, not, a, vegetation, type, although, the, plants, in, the, area, have, evolved, in, isolation, because, of, the, physical, barriers, of, the, sierra, nevadas, and, the, colorado, plateau, predominant, plants, of, the, mojave, desert, include, all, scale, atriplex, polycarpa, creosote, bush, larrea, tridentata, brittlebush, encelia, farinosa, desert, holly, atriplex, hymenelytra, white, burrobush, hymenoclea, salsola, and, most, notably, the, joshua, tree, yucca, brevifolia, additionally, the, mojave, desert, is, also, home, to, various, species, of, cacti, such, as, silver, cholla, cylindropuntia, echinocarpa, mojave, prickly, pear, o, erinacea, beavertail, cactus, o, basilaris, and, many, headed, barrel, cactus, echinocactus, polycephalus, less, common, but, distinctive, plants, of, the, mojave, desert, include, ironwood, olneya, tesota, blue, palo, verde, parkinsonia, florida, chuparosa, justicia, californica, spiny, menodora, menodora, spinescens, desert, senna, cassia, armata, california, dalea, psorothamnus, arborescens, and, goldenhead, acamptopappus, shockleyi, the, mojave, desert, is, generally, abundant, in, winter, annuals, 11, the, plants, of, the, mojave, desert, each, generally, correspond, to, an, individual, geographic, feature, as, such, there, are, distinctive, flora, communities, within, the, desert, notable, species, of, the, mojave, desert, include, bighorn, sheep, ovis, canadensis, mountain, lions, puma, concolor, black, tailed, jackrabbits, lepus, californicus, and, desert, tortoises, gopherus, agassizii, various, other, species, are, particularly, common, in, the, mojave, desert, such, as, the, leconte, s, thrasher, toxostoma, lecontei,

lichanura, trivirgata, western, patch, nosed, snake, salvadora, hexalepis, and, mojave, rattlesnake, crotalus, scutulatus, these, species, can, also, occur, in, the, neighboring, sonoran, and, great, basin, deserts, the, animal, species, of, the, mojave, desert, have, generally, fewer, endemics, than, its, flora, however, endemic, fauna, of, the, mojave, desert, include, kelso, dunes, jerusalem, cricket, ammopelmatus, kelsoensis, the, kelso, dunes, shieldback, katydid, eremopedes, kelsoensis, the, mohave, ground, squirrel, spermophilus, mohavensis, and, amargosa, vole, microtus, californicus, scirpensis, the, mojave, fringe, toed, lizard, uma, scopari, a, is, not, endemic, but, almost, completely, limited, to, the, mojave, desert, there, are, also, aquatic, species, that, are, found, nowhere, else, such, as, the, devils, hole, pupfish, limited, to, one, hot, spring, near, death, valley, before, the, european, colonization, of, north, america, tribes, of, native, americans, such, as, the, mohave, were, hunter, gatherers, living, in, the, mojave, desert, european, explorers, started, exploring, the, deserts, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, francisco, garc, s, a, franciscan, friar, was, the, first, explorer, of, the, mojave, desert, in, 1776, garc, s, recorded, information, about, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, deserts, later, as, american, interests, expanded, into, california, american, explorers, started, probing, the, california, deserts, jedediah, smith, travelled, through, the, mojave, desert, in, 1826, finally, reaching, the, san, gabriel, mission, in, recent, years, human, development, in, the, mojave, desert, has, become, increasingly, present, human, development, at, the, major, urban, and, suburban, centers, of, las, vegas, and, los, angeles, has, had, an, increasingly, damaging, effect, on, the, wildlife, of, the, mojave, desert, an, added, demand, for, landfill, space, as, a, result, of, the, large, metropolitan, centers, of, las, vegas, and, los, angeles, also, has, the, real, potential, to, drastically, affect, flora, and, fauna, of, the, mojave, desert, agricultural, development, along, the, colorado, river, close, to, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, mojave, desert, also, causes, habitat, loss, and, degradation, areas, that, are, particularly, affected, by, human, development, include, ward, valley, and, riverside, county, the, united, states, military, also, maintains, installations, in, the, mojave, desert, making, the, mojave, a, critical, training, location, for, the, united, states, department, of, defense, the, mojave, desert, has, long, been, a, valuable, resource, for, people, and, as, its, human, population, grows, its, importance, will, only, grow, miners, ranchers, and, farmers, rely, on, the, desert, for, a, living, the, mojave, is, also, used, by, the, state, of, california, to, meet, renewable, energy, objectives, large, tracts, of, the, desert, are, owned, by, federal, agencies, and, are, leased, at, low, cost, by, wind, and, solar, energy, companies, although, these, renewable, developments, can, cause, their, own, environmental, impact, and, disturb, cultural, landscapes, and, visual, resources, desert, sunlight, solar, farm, one, of, the, largest, solar, farms, in, the, world, was, built, approximately, five, miles, from, joshua, tree, national, park, an, endangered, yuma,
