early, as, the, 17th, century, thus, the, joseon, capital, of, hanseong, was, widely, referred, to, as, the, seoul, due, to, its, common, usage, french, missionaries, called, the, joseon, capital, s, oul, se, ul, in, their, writings, hence, the, common, romanization, seoul, in, various, languages, today, under, subsequent, japanese, colonization, hanseong, was, renamed, as, keij, literally,

to, have, been, at, the, main, wiryeseong, site, as, the, three, kingdoms, competed, for, this, strategic, region, control, passed, from, baekje, to, goguryeo, in, the, 5th, century, however, according, to, samguk, sagi, both, baekje, and, silla, described, the, land, as, frontier, border, of, baekje, not, as, the, capital, region, moreover, jinheung, taewang, stele, found, at, current,

name, of, han, river, during, this, time, was, likely, namcheon, nam, river, itself, or, should, have, the, word, ending, with, cheon, not, gang, nor, su, in, addition, bukhansan, jinheung, stele, clearly, states, that, silla, had, possession, of, hanseong, modern, day, pyongyang, thus, bukhansan, has, to, be, located, north, of, hanseong, modern, day, pyongyang, was, not, pyongyang, taedong, river, was, likely, han, river, and, bukhansan, was, not, bukhansan, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, moreover, pyongyang, was, a, common, noun, meaning, capital, used, by, goguryeo, and, goryeo,

reestablished, bukhansan, province, in, order, to, strengthen, the, northern, border, the, city, lost, its, provincial, capital, position, and, was, put, under, bukhansan, province, once, again, this, further, proves, that, bukhansan, was, located, in, the, north, of, modern, day, pyongyang, as, changing, the, provincial, name, and, objective, would, not, be, required, if, bukhansan, was, located, within, seoul, in, the, 11th, century, goryeo, which, succeeded, unified, silla, built, a, summer, palace, in, seoul, which, was, referred, to, as, the, southern, capital, it, was, only, from, this,
