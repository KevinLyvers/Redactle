hamas, has, developed, a, robust, domestic, rocket, making, industry, that, uses, pipes, electrical, wiring, and, other, everyday, materials, for, improvised, production, the, state, of, palestine, has, a, number, of, security, forces, including, a, civil, police, force, national, security, forces, and, intelligence, services, with, the, function, of, maintaining, security, and, protecting, palestinian, citizens, and, the, palestinian, state, all, of, these, forces, are, part, of, palestinian, security, services, the, psf, is, primarily, responsible, for, maintaining, internal, security,

liberation, organization, plo, it, was, established, during, the, early, years, of, the, palestinian, national, movement, but, has, largely, been, inactive, since, the, oslo, accords, the, pla, s, role, was, intended, to, be, a, conventional, military, force, but, has, shifted, to, a, more, symbolic, and, political, role, palestine, is, classified, as, a, middle, income, and, developing, country, by, the, imf, in, 2023, gdp, of, the, country, was, 40, billion, and, per, capita, around, 4, 500, due, to, its, disputed, status, the, economic, condition, have, been, affected, the, co2, emission, metric, tons, per, capita, was, 0, 6, in, 2010, according, to, a, survey, of, 2011, palestine, s, poverty, rate, was, 25, 8, according, to, a, new, world, bank, report, palestinian, economic, growth, is, expected, to, soften, in, 2023, economy, of, palestine, relies, heavily, on, international, aids, remittances, by, overseas, palestinians, and, local, industries, according, to, a, report, by, the, world, bank, the, economic, impact, of, israel, s, closure, policy, has, been, profound, directly, contributing, to, a, significant, decline, in, economic, activity, widespread, unemployment, and, a, rise, in, poverty, since, the, onset, of, the, second, intifada, in, september, 2000, the, israeli, restrictions, imposed, on, area, c, alone, result, in, an, estimated, annual, loss, of, approximately, 3, 4, billion, which, accounts, for, nearly, half, of, the, current, palestinian, gdp, these, restrictions, have, severely, hindered, economic, growth, and, development, in, the, region, in, the, aftermath, of, israel, s, military, offensive, on, the, gaza, strip, in, winter, 2014, where, a, staggering, number, of, structures, were, damaged, or, destroyed, the, flow, of, construction, and, raw, materials, into, gaza, has, been, severely, limited, additionally, regular, exports, from, the, region, have, been, completely, halted, exacerbating, the, economic, challenges, faced, by, the, population, one, of, the, burdensome, measures, imposed, by, israel, is, the, back, to, back, system, enforced, at, crossing, points, within, palestinian, territories, this, policy, forces, shippers, to, unload, and, reload, their, goods, from, one, truck, to, another, resulting, in, significant, transportation, costs, and, longer, transit, times, for, both, finished, products, and, raw, materials, these, additional, expenses, further, impede, economic, growth, and, viability, under, the, oslo, ii, accords, signed, in, 1995, it, was, agreed, that, governance, of, area, c, would, be, transferred, to, the, palestinian, authority, within, 18, months, except, for, matters, to, be, determined, in, the, final, status, agreement, however, israel, has, failed, to, fulfill, its, obligations, under, the, oslo, agreement, highlighting, the, urgent, need, for, accountability, and, an, end, to, impunity, the, european, commission, has, highlighted, the, detrimental, impact, of, the, separation, barrier, constructed, by, israel, estimating, that, it, has, led, to, an, annual, economic, impoverishment, of, palestinians, by, 2, 3, of, gdp, furthermore, the, escalating, number, of, internal, and, external, closures, continues, to, have, a, devastating, effect, on, any, prospects, for, economic, recovery, in, the, region, a, recent, study, conservatively, estimating, the, economic, impact, of, israel, s, occupation, and, practices, revealed, alarming, findings, in, 2010, alone, israel, s, illegal, use, of, palestinian, natural, resources, accounted, for, us, 1, 83, billion, equivalent, to, 22, of, palestine, s, gdp, that, year, according, to, a, world, bank, report, the, manufacturing, sector, s, share, of, gdp, decreased, from, 19, to, 10, since, the, signing, of, the, oslo, accords, until, 2011, the, same, report, which, adopted, conservative, estimates, suggests, that, access, to, area, c, in, specific, sectors, like, dead, sea, minerals, telecommunications, mining, tourism, and, construction, could, contribute, at, least, 22, to, palestinian, gdp, in, fact, the, report, notes, that, israel, and, jordan, together, generate, around, 4, 2, billion, annually, from, the, sale, of, these, products, representing, 6, of, the, global, potash, supply, and, 73, of, global, bromine, output, overall, if, palestinians, had, unrestricted, access, to, their, own, land, in, area, c, the, potential, economic, benefits, for, palestine, could, increase, by, 35, of, gdp, amounting, to, at, least, 3, 4, billion, annually, similarly, water, restrictions, incurred, a, cost, of, us, 1, 903, billion, equivalent, to, 23, 4, of, gdp, while, israel, s, ongoing, blockade, on, the, gaza, strip, resulted, in, a, cost, of, 1, 908, billion, us, representing, 23, 5, of, gdp, in, 2010, these, burdens, are, unsustainable, for, any, economy, artificially, limiting, palestine, s, economic, potential, and, its, right, to, develop, a, prosperous, society, with, a, stable, economy, and, sustainable, growth, the, state, of, palestine, s, overall, gross, domestic, product, gdp, has, declined, by, 35, in, the, first, quarter, of, 2024, due, to, the, ongoing, war, in, gaza, the, palestinian, central, bureau, of, statistics, pcbs, reports, there, was, a, stark, difference, between, the, west, bank, which, witnessed, a, decline, of, 25, and,

significant, setbacks, the, sector, s, contribution, to, the, gdp, declined, and, the, agricultural, labor, force, decreased, the, cultivated, areas, in, the, west, bank, continuously, declined,

of, exports, were, previously, sent, to, arab, gulf, countries, palestinian, exports, to, the, gulf, states, declined, by, 14, as, a, result, of, the, war, causing, a, significant, economic, impact,
