the, world, economy, despite, the, absence, of, armed, conflicts, in, east, asia, for, decades, the, stability, of, the, region, remains, delicate, due, to, the, presence, of, north, korea, s, nuclear, program, and, chinese, geopolitical, encroachment, and, provocations, occurring, in, taiwanese, waters, these, tensions, have, emerged, from, the, contentious, relationship, between, mainland, china, and, taiwan, as, the, former, seeks, to, reunify, with, taiwan, while, the, latter, strives, to, maintain, its, sovereign, independence, and, preserve, the, present, geopolitical,

societal, value, system, once, instituted, by, imperial, china, other, usages, define, china, hong, kong, macau, japan, north, korea, south, korea, and, taiwan, as, countries, that, constitute, east, asia, based, on, their, geographic, proximity, as, well, as, historical, and, modern, cultural, and, economic, ties, particularly, with, japan, and, korea, in, having, retained, strong, cultural, influences, that, originated, from, china, some, scholars, include, vietnam, as, part, of, east, asia, as, it, has, been, considered, part, of, the, greater, chinese, cultural, sphere, though, confucianism, continues, to, play, an, important, role, in, vietnamese, culture, chinese, characters, are, no, longer, used, in, its, written, language, and, many, scholarly, organizations, classify, vietnam, as, a, southeast, asian, country, mongolia, is, geographically, north, of, mainland, china, yet, confucianism, and, the, chinese, writing, system, and, culture, had, limited, impact, on, mongolian, society, thus, mongolia, is, sometimes, grouped, with, central, asian, countries, such, as, turkmenistan, kyrgyzstan, and, kazakhstan, xinjiang, and, tibet, are, sometimes, seen, as, part, of, central, asia, see, also, greater, central, asia, broader, and, looser, definitions, by, international, agencies, and, organisations, such, as, the, world, bank, refer, to, east, asia, as, the, three, major, northeast, asian, economies, i, e, mainland, china, japan, and, south, korea, as, well, as, mongolia, north, korea, the, russian, far, east, and, siberia, the, council, on, foreign,

regions, of, the, russian, federation, the, unsd, definition, of, east, asia, is, based, on, statistical, convenience, but, others, commonly, use, the, same, definition, of, mainland, china, hong, kong, macau, mongolia, north, korea, south, korea, taiwan, and, japan, certain, japanese, islands, are, associated, with, oceania, due, to, non, continental, geology, distance, from, mainland, asia,

world, health, organization, label, this, region, the, western, pacific, with, east, asia, not, being, used, in, their, concept, of, major, world, regions, their, definition, of, this, region, further, includes, mongolia, and, the, adjacent, area, of, cambodia, as, well, as, the, countries, of, the, south, east, asia, archipelago, excluding, east, timor, and, indonesia, in, the, context, of, business, and, economics, east, asia, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, geographical, area, covering, ten, southeast, asian, countries, in, asean, greater, china, japan, and, korea, however, in, this, context, the, term, far, east, is, used, by, the, europeans, to, cover, asean, countries, and, the, countries, in, east, asia, on, rare, occasions, the, term, is, also, sometimes, taken, to, include, india, and, other, south, asian, countries, that, are, not, situated, within, the, bounds, of, the, asia, pacific, although, the, term, indo, pacific, is, more, commonly, used, for, such, a, definition, observers, preferring, a, broader, definition, of, east, asia, often, use, the, term, northeast, asia, to, refer, to, china, the, korean, peninsula, and, japan, with, the, region, of, southeast, asia, covering, the, ten, asean, countries, this, usage, which, is, seen, in, economic, and, diplomatic, discussions, is, at, odds, with, the, historical, meanings, of, both, east, asia, and, northeast, asia, the, council, on, foreign, relations, of, the, united, states, defines, northeast, asia, as, japan, and, korea, east, asia, is, home, to, many, climatic, zones, it, also, has, unique, weather, patterns, such, as, the, east, asian, rainy, season, and, the, east, asian, monsoon, like, the, rest, of, the, world, east, asia, has, been, getting, warmer, due, to,

world, potentially, reaching, us, 254, million, by, 2050, under, the, highest, climate, change, scenario, and, in, the, absence, of, adaptation, cumulative, economic, losses, caused, by, sea, level, rise, in, guangzhou, would, exceed, us, 1, trillion, by, 2100, shanghai, is, also, expected, to, experience, annual, losses, of, around, 1, of, the, local, gdp, in, the, absence, of, adaptation, the,
