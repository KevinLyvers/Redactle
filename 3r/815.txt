gisaka, dynasty, killed, rwanda, s, king, ruganzu, i, bwimba, in, the, 16th, century, but, ruganzu, s, son, cyilima, i, rugwe, fought, back, with, help, from, bugesera, and, was, able, to, expand,

resident, of, rwanda, and, established, the, city, as, the, headquarters, alexis, kagame, promoted, an, alternative, theory, that, the, city, was, established, as, a, capital, under, cyilima, i, rugwe, in, either, the, 1300s, or, the, 1500s, there, is, little, direct, evidence, for, this, however, and, the, more, recent, kings, of, the, pre, colonial, era, are, known, to, have, been, based, at, nyanza, rwanda, and, neighbouring, burundi, had, been, assigned, to, germany, by, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, forming, part, of, german, east, africa, and, germany, established, a,

the, nile, when, germany, decided, in, 1907, to, separate, the, administration, of, rwanda, from, that, of, burundi, kandt, was, appointed, as, resident, he, chose, to, make, his, headquarters, in, kigali, due, to, its, central, location, in, the, country, and, also, because, the, site, on, nyarugenge, hill, afforded, good, views, and, security, kandt, s, house, located, close, to, the, central, business, district, cbd, was, the, first, european, style, house, in, the, city, and, remains, in, use, today, as, the, kandt, house, museum, of, natural, history, despite, a, german, ordinance, written, in, 1905, which, prohibited, non, indigenous, natives, from, entering, rwanda, kandt, began, permitting, the, entry, of, foreign, traders, in, 1908, which, allowed, commercial, activity, to,

assert, direct, rule, on, the, mandate, placing, king, musinga, under, arrest, and, sidelining, rwandans, in, the, judiciary, in, this, period, kigali, was, one, of, two, provincial, capitals, alongside, gisenyi, an, agricultural, labour, shortage, caused, by, the, recruitment, of, locals, to, assist, the, european, armies, during, the, war, the, plundering, of, food, by, soldiers, and, torrential, rains, which, destroyed, crops, led, to, a, severe, famine, at, the, start, of, the, belgian, administration, the, famine, combined, with, the, difficulty, of, governing, the, complex, rwandan, society, prompted, the, belgians, to, re, establish, the, german, style, indirect, rule, at, the, end, of, 1917, musinga, was, restored, to, his, throne, at, nyanza, with, kigali, remaining,

1962, two, other, cities, were, considered, nyanza, as, the, traditional, seat, of, the, mwami, and, the, southern, city, of, butare, known, as, astrida, under, the, belgians, due, to, its, prominence, as, a, centre, of, intellect, and, religion, the, authorities, eventually, chose, kigali, because, of, its, more, central, location, the, city, grew, steadily, during, the, following,
