the, strait, of, dover, or, dover, strait, french, pas, de, calais, french, pronunciation, strait, of, calais, is, the, strait, at, the, narrowest, part, of, the, english, channel, marking, the, boundary, between, the, channel, and, the, north, sea, and, separating, great, britain, from, continental, europe, the, shortest, distance, across, the, strait, at, approximately, 20, miles, 32, kilometres, is, from, the, south, foreland, northeast, of, dover, in, the, english, county, of, kent, to, cap, gris, nez, a, cape, near, to, calais, in, the, french, d, partement, of, pas, de, calais, between, these, points, lies, the, most, popular, route, for, cross, channel, swimmers, the, entire, strait, is, within, the, territorial, waters, of, france, and, the, united, kingdom, but, a, right, of, transit, passage, under, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, allows, vessels, of, other, nations, to, move, freely, through, the, strait, on, a, clear, day, it, is, possible, to, see, the, opposite, coastline, of, england, from, france, and, vice, versa, with, the, naked, eye, with, the, most, famous, and, obvious, sight, being, the, white, cliffs, of, dover, from, the, french, coastline, and, shoreline, buildings, on, both, coastlines, as, well, as, lights, on, either, coastline, at, night, as, in, matthew, arnold, s, poem, dover, beach, most, maritime, traffic, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, north, sea, and, baltic, sea, passes, through, the, strait, of, dover, rather, than, taking, the, longer, and, more, dangerous, route, around, the, north, of, scotland, the, strait, is, one, of, the, busiest, international, seaways, in, the, world, used, by, over, 400, commercial, vessels, daily, this, has, made, traffic, safety, a, critical, issue, with, hm, coastguard, and, the, maritime, gendarmerie, maintaining, a, 24, hour, watch, over, the, strait, and, enforcing, a, strict, regime, of, shipping, lanes, in, addition, to, the, intensive, north, east, to, south, west, traffic, the, strait, is, crossed, from, north, west, to, south, east, by, ferries, linking, dover, to, calais, and, dunkirk, until, 1994, these, provided, the, only, route, across, it, except, for, air, transport, the, channel, tunnel, now, provides, an, alternative, route, crossing, beneath, the, strait, at, an, average, depth, of, 45, m, 148, ft, below, the, seabed, the, town, of, dover, gives, its, name, to, one, of, the, sea, areas, of, the, british, shipping, forecast, the, formation, of, strait, was, through, scouring, by, erosion, it, had, for, many, millennia, since, the, last, warm, interglacial, been, a, land, bridge, that, linked, the, weald, in, great, britain, to, the, boulonnais, in, the, pas, de, calais, though, pitted, by, troughs, and, rivers, the, english, channel, was, almost, mainly, land, at, the, height, of, the, last, ice, age, the, predominant, geology, of, both, and, of, the, seafloor, is, chalk, although, somewhat, resistant, to, erosion, erosion, of, both, coasts, has, created, the, famous, white, cliffs, of, dover, in, the, uk, and, the, cap, blanc, nez, in, france, the, channel, tunnel, was, bored, through, solid, chalk, compacted, remains, of, sea, creatures, and, marine, deposited, ground, up, calciferous, rock, soil, debris, the, rhine, as, the, urstrom, flows, northeast, into, the, north, sea, as, the, sea, covering, most, of, the, netherlands, fell, during, the, start, of, the, first, of, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, the, new, ice, unusually, created, a, dam, from, scandinavia, to, scotland, and, the, rhine, combined, with, the, thames, and, drainage, from, much, of, north, europe, created, a, vast, lake, behind, the, dam, which, eventually, spilled, over, the, weald, into, the, english, channel, this, overflow, followed, by, further, scouring, became, recognisably, the, short, straits, an, alternative, name, for, this, strait, about, 425, 000, years, ago, a, narrow, deep, channel, along, the, middle, of, the, strait, is, the, remnants, of, the, main, summer, outflow, of, the, northern, ustrom, glacial, lake, a, collect, for, other, then, seasonal, rivers, in, winter, iced, up, such, as, the, thames, and, weser, in, the, last, ice, age, a, deposit, in, east, anglia, marks, the, old, preglacial, northward, course, of, the, urstrom, thames, when, it, also, drained, doggerland, the, deep, sea, floor, east, of, lincolnshire, and, east, yorkshire, connecting, to, the, atlantic, via, the, pentland, firth, in, the, last, glaciation, of, over, 300, 000, years, is, a, necessary, pre, condition, for, the, relatively, late, cutting, through, of, the, strait, to, the, south, likewise, a, 2007, study, concluded, that, the, strait, was, formed, by, erosion, caused, by, two, major, floods, the, first, was, about, 425, 000, years, ago, when, an, ice, dammed, lake, in, the, southern, north, sea, overflowed, and, broke, the, weald, artois, boulonnais, chalk, range, in, a, catastrophic, erosion, and, flood, event, consequently, the, ice, age, muted, flows, from, the, thames, and, scheldt, flowed, through, the, gap, into, the, english, channel, inlet, but, the, meuse, and, rhine, still, flowed, without, any, significant, link, to, the, inlet, such, as, today, s, ijssel, distributary, supports, in, a, second, flood, about, 225, 000, years, ago, supported, by, glaciers, extending, from, areas, then, land, such, as, the, zuiderzee, the, meuse, and, rhine, were, ice, dammed, into, a, lake, that, broke, catastrophically, through, a, high, weak, barrier, perhaps, chalk, or, an, end, moraine, left, by, the, ice, sheet, both, floods, cut, massive, flood, channels, in, the, dry, bed, of, the, english, channel, somewhat, like, the, channeled, scablands, or, the, wabash, river, in, the, usa, a, further, update, in, 2017, attributed, a, series, of, previously, described, underwater, holes, in, the, channel, floor, 100m, deep, and, in, places, several, kilometres, in, diameter, to, lake, water, plunging, over, a, rock, ridge, causing, isolated, depressions, or, plunge, pools, the, melting, ice, and, rising, sea, levels, submerged, doggerland, the, area, linking, britain, to, france, around, 6, 500, 6, 200, bce, the, lobourg, strait, the, deepest, part, the, strait, runs, its, 6, km, 4, mi, wide, slash, on, a, nne, ssw, axis, nearer, to, the, french, coast, than, to, the, english, it, borders, the, varne, sandbank, shoals, where, it, plunges, to, 68, m, 223, ft, and, further, south, the, ridge, bank, shoals, french, name, colbart, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 62, m, 203, ft, the, depth, of, the, strait, varies, between, 68, m, 223, ft, at, the, lobourg, strait, and, 20, m, 66, ft, at, the, highest, banks, the, seabed, forms, successions, of, three, habitats, the, strong, tidal, currents, of, the, strait, at, depth, slow, around, its, rocky, masses, as, these, stimulate, countercurrents, and, deep, calm, pockets, where, many, species, can, find, shelter, in, these, calmer, lee, zones, the, water, is, clearer, than, in, the, rest, of, the, strait, thus, algae, can, grow, despite, the, 46, m, 151, ft, average, depth, they, help, increase, diversity, in, the, local, species, some, of, which, are, endemic, to, the, strait, moreover, this, is, a, transition, zone, for, the, species, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, those, of, the, southern, part, of, the, north, sea, this, mix, of, various, environments, promotes, a, wide, variety, of, wildlife, the, ridens, de, boulogne, a, 10, 20, m, 33, 66, ft, deep, rocky, shoal, partially, sand, capped, 15, nmi, 28, km, 17, mi, west, of, boulogne, boasts, the, highest, profusion, of, maerl, in, the, strait, thus, some, 682, km, 2, 263, sq, mi, of, the, strait, is, classified, as, a, natura, 2000, protection, zone, named, ridens, et, dunes, hydrauliques, du, pas, de, calais, ridens, and, sub, aqueous, dunes, of, the, dover, strait, this, includes, the, sub, aqueous, dunes, of, varne, colbart, vergoyer, and, bassurelle, the, ridens, de, boulogne, and, the, lobourg, channel, which, provides, calmer, and, clearer, waters, due, to, its, depth, reaching, 68, m, 223, ft, many, crossings, other, than, in, conventional, vessels, have, been, attempted, including, by, pedalo, jetpack, bathtub, amphibious, vehicle, and, more, commonly, by, swimming, since, french, law, bans, many, of, them, unlike, english, law, most, such, crossings, originate, in, england, in, the, late, 17th, century, during, the, little, ice, age, there, were, reports, of, severe, winter, ice, in, the, english, channel, and, strait, of, dover, including, a, case, in, 1684, of, only, a, league, of, open, water, remaining, between, dover, and, calais
