gan, xin, and, xiu, rivers, and, flows, northward, into, the, yangtze, river, through, a, channel, the, area, of, poyang, lake, fluctuates, dramatically, between, the, wet, and, dry, seasons, but, in, recent, years, the, size, of, the, lake, has, been, decreasing, overall, in, a, normal, year, the, area, of, the, lake, averages, 3, 500, square, kilometers, 1, 400, sq, mi, in, early, 2012, drought, sand, quarrying, and, the, practice, of, storing, water, at, the, three, gorges, dam, lowered, the, area, of, the, lake, to, about, 200, square, kilometers, 77, sq, mi, the, lake, provides, a, habitat, for, half, a, million, migratory, birds, and, is, a, favorite, destination, for, birding, during, the, winter, the, lake, becomes, home, to, many, migrating, siberian, cranes, up, to, 90, of, which, spend, the, winter, there, poyang, lake, has, also, been, called, pengli, lake, historically, but, they, are, not, the, same, before, the, han, dynasty, the, yangtze, followed, a, more, northerly, course, through, what, is, now, longgan, lake, whilst, pengli, marsh, formed, the, lower, reaches, of, the, gan, river, the, area, that, is, now, poyang, lake, was, a, plain, along, the, gan, river, around, ad, 400, the, new, more, southerly, course, of, the, yangtze, river, switched, again, causing, the, gan, river, to, further, back, up, and, form, lake, poyang, the, lake, was,

its, area, reached, 6, 000, square, kilometers, 2, 300, sq, mi, a, fishing, ban, has, been, in, place, since, 2002, in, january, 2020, china, imposed, a, 10, year, fishing, moratorium, on, 332, sites, along, the, yangtze, including, poyang, lake, to, protect, marine, biodiversity, in, 2007, fears, were, expressed, that, china, s, finless, porpoise, locally, known, as, the, jiangzhu, river, pig, a, native, of, the, lake, along, with, other, waters, such, as, dongting, lake, might, follow, the, baiji, the, yangtze, river, dolphin, into, extinction, calls, have, been, made, for, action, to, be, taken, to, save, the, porpoise, of, which, there, are, about, 1, 400, left, with, between, 700, and, 900, in, the, yangtze, and, another, about, 500, in, poyang, and, dongting, lakes, 2007, population, levels, are, less, than, half, the, 1997, levels, and, the, population, is, dropping, at, a, rate, of, 7, 3, percent, per, year, sand, dredging, has, become, a, mainstay, of, local, economic, development, in, the, last, few, years, and, is, an, important, source, of, revenue, in, the, region, that, borders, poyang, lake, but, at, the, same, time, high, density, dredging, projects, have, been, the, principal, cause, of, the, death, of, the, local, wildlife, population, dredging, makes, the, waters, of, the, lake, muddier, and, the, porpoises, cannot, see, as, far, as, they, once, could, and, have, to, rely, on, their, highly, developed, sonar, systems, to, avoid, obstacles, and, look, for, food, large, ships, enter, and, leave, the, lake, at, the, rate, of, two, per, minute, and, such, a, high, density, of, shipping, means, the, porpoises, have, difficulty, hearing, their, food, and, also, cannot, swim, freely, from, one, bank, to, the, other, furthermore, construction, of, poyang, lake, dam, is, expected, to, cause, devastating, effects, on, the, remaining, porpoises, due, to, the, three, gorges, dam, upriver, on, the, yangtze, river, poyang, lake, can, seasonally, shrink, and, dry, up, in, 2012, the, lake, nearly, dried, up, completely, 200, square, kilometers, 77, sq, mi, of, land, was, underwater, in, october, while, the, lake, is, normally, 3, 500, square, kilometers, 1, 400, sq, mi, in, area, when, full, in, addition, to, the, three, gorges, dam, which, must, store, water, in, its, reservoir, to, be, usable, in, winter, a, drought, was, also, blamed, for, the, shrinkage, the, jiangxi, local, government, has, proposed, to, build, the, poyang, lake, dam, to, maintain, water, levels, in, the, lake, building, a, sluice, wall, across, the, connection, between, the, lake, and, the, yangtze, river, an, environmental, impact, assessment, is, pending, scientists, as, well, as, environmental, groups, such, as, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, have, criticized, the, proposal, arguing, that, artificially, engineering, water, levels, in, the, lake, will, adversely, affect, wildlife, diversity, in, 1363, the, battle, of, lake, poyang, took, place, there, the, battle, is, claimed, to, be, the, largest, naval, battle, in, history
