prosperity, in, africa, than, in, the, united, states, between, 1822, and, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1861, more, than, 15, 000, freed, and, free, born, african, americans,

colonizing, the, indigenous, population, led, by, the, americo, liberians, liberia, declared, independence, on, july, 26, 1847, which, the, u, s, did, not, recognize, until, february, 5, 1862, liberia, was, the, first, african, republic, to, proclaim, its, independence, and, is, africa, s, first, and, oldest, modern, republic, along, with, ethiopia, it, was, one, of, the, two, african, countries, to, maintain, its, sovereignty, and, independence, during, the, european, colonial, scramble, for, africa, during, world, war, ii, liberia, supported, the, united, states, war, effort, against, germany, and, in, turn, received, considerable, american, investment, in, infrastructure, which, aided, the, country, s, wealth, and, development, president, william, tubman, encouraged, economic, and, political, changes, that, heightened, the, country, s, prosperity, and, international, profile, liberia, was, a, founding, member, of, the, league, of, nations, united, nations, and, the, organisation, of, african, unity, the, americo, liberian, settlers, did, not, relate, well, to, the, indigenous, peoples, they, encountered, colonial, settlements, were, raided, by, the, kru, and, grebo, from, their, inland, chiefdoms, americo, liberians, formed, into, a, small, elite, that, held, disproportionate, political, power, while, indigenous, africans, were, excluded, from, birthright, citizenship, in, their, own, land, until, 1904, in, 1980, political, tensions, from, the, rule, of, william, r, tolbert, resulted, in, a, military, coup, marking, the, end, of, americo,

his, own, dictatorship, and, taylor, was, overthrown, by, the, end, of, the, war, in, 2003, the, two, wars, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 250, 000, people, about, 8, of, the, population, and, the, displacement, of, many, more, with, liberia, s, economy, shrinking, by, 90, a, peace, agreement, in, 2003, led, to, democratic, elections, in, 2005, the, country, has, remained, relatively, stable, since, then, the, presence, of, oldowan, artifacts, in, west, africa, was, confirmed, by, michael, omolewa, attesting, to, the, presence, of, ancient, humans, undated, acheulean, esa, artifacts, are, well, documented, across, west, africa, the, emerging, chronometric, record, of, the, middle, stone, age, msa, indicates, that, core, and, flake, technologies, have, been, present, in, west, africa, since, at, least, the, chibanian, 780, 126, thousand, years, ago, or, ka, in, northern, open, sahelian, zones, and, that, they, persisted, until, the, terminal, pleistocene, holocene, boundary, 12, ka, in, both, northern, and, southern, zones, of, west, africa, this, makes, them, the, youngest, examples, of, such, msa, technology, anywhere, in, africa, the, presence, of, msa, populations, in, forests, remains, an, open, question, technological, differences, may, correlate, with, various, ecological, zones, later, stone, age, lsa, populations, evidence, significant, technological, diversification, including, both, microlithic, and, macrolithic, traditions, the, record, shows, that, aceramic, and, ceramic, lsa, assemblages, in, west, africa, overlap, chronologically, and, that, changing, densities, of, microlithic, industries, from, the, coast, to, the, north, are, geographically, structured, these, features, may, represent, social, networks, or, some, form, of, cultural, diffusion, allied, to, changing, ecological, conditions, microlithic, industries, with, ceramics, became, common, by, the, mid, holocene, coupled, with, an, apparent, intensification, of, wild, food, exploitation, between, 4, 3, 5, ka, these, societies, gradually, transformed, into, food, producers, possibly, through, contact, with, northern, pastoralists, and, agriculturalists, as, the, environment, became, more, arid, hunter, gatherers, have, survived, in, the, more, forested, parts, of, west, africa, until, much, later, attesting, to, the, strength, of, ecological, boundaries, in, this, region, the, pepper, coast, also, known, as, the, grain, coast, has, been, inhabited, by, indigenous, peoples, of, africa, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, 12th, century, mande, speaking, people, expanded, from, the, north, and, east, forcing, many, smaller, ethnic, groups, southward, toward, the, atlantic, ocean, the, dei, bassa, kru, gola, and, kissi, were, some, of, the, earliest, documented, peoples, in, the, area, this, influx, of, these, groups, was, compounded, by, the, decline, of, the, mali, empire, in, 1375, and, the, songhai, empire, in, 1591, as, inland, regions, underwent, desertification, inhabitants, moved, to, the, wetter, coast, these, new, inhabitants, brought, skills, such, as, cotton, spinning, cloth, weaving, iron, smelting, rice, and, sorghum, cultivation, and, social, and, political, institutions, from, the, mali, and, songhai, empires, shortly, after, the, mane, conquered, the, region, the, vai, people, of, the, former, mali, empire, immigrated, into, the, grand, cape, mount, county, region, the, ethnic, kru, opposed, the, influx, of, vai, forming, an, alliance, with, the, mane, to, stop, further, influx, of, vai, people, along, the, coast, built, canoes, and, traded, with, other, west, africans, from, cap, vert, to, the, gold, coast, between, 1461, and, the, late, 17th, century, portuguese, dutch, and, british, traders, had, contacts, and, trading, posts, in, the, region, the, portuguese, named, the, area, costa, da, pimenta, pepper, coast, but, it, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, grain, coast, due, to, the, abundance, of, melegueta, pepper, grains, the, traders, would, barter, commodities, and, goods, with, local, people, in, the, united, states, there, was, a, movement, to, settle, african, americans, both, free, born, and, formerly, enslaved, in, africa, this, was, because, they, faced, racial, discrimination, in, the, form, of, political, disenfranchisement, and, the, denial, of, civil, religious, and, social, rights, formed, in, 1816, the, american, colonization, society, acs, was, made, up, mostly, of, quakers, and, slaveholders, quakers, believed, black, people, would, face, better, chances, for, freedom, in, africa, than, in, the, u, s, while, slaveholders, opposed, freedom, for, enslaved, people, some, viewed, repatriation, of, free, people, of, color, as, a, way, to, avoid, slave, rebellions, in, 1822, the, american, colonization, society, began, sending, free, people, of, color, to, the, pepper, coast, voluntarily, to, establish, a, colony, mortality, from,

assisted, in, the, migration, of, more, than, 13, 000, people, of, color, from, the, united, states, and, the, caribbean, to, liberia, these, free, african, americans, and, their, descendants, married, within, their, community, and, came, to, identify, as, americo, liberians, many, were, of, mixed, race, and, educated, in, american, culture, they, did, not, identify, with, the, indigenous, natives, of, the, tribes, they, encountered, they, developed, an, ethnic, group, that, had, a, cultural, tradition, infused, with, american, notions, of, political, republicanism, and, protestant, christianity, the, acs, supported, by, prominent, american, politicians, such, as, abraham, lincoln, henry, clay, and, james, monroe, believed, repatriation, was, preferable, to, having, emancipated, slaves, remain, in, the, united, states, similar, state, based, organizations, established, colonies, in, mississippi, in, africa, kentucky, in, africa, and, the, republic, of, maryland, which, liberia, later, annexed, lincoln, in, 1862, described, liberia, as, only, in, a, certain, sense, a, success, and, proposed, instead, that, free, people, of, color, be, assisted, to, emigrate, to, chiriqu, today, part, of, panama, the, americo, liberian, settlers, did, not, relate, well, to, the, indigenous, peoples, they, encountered, especially, those, in, communities, of, the, more, isolated, bush, the, colonial, settlements, were, raided, by, the, kru, and, grebo, from, their, inland, chiefdoms, encounters, with, tribal, africans, in, the, bush, often, became, violent, believing, themselves, different, from, and, culturally, and, educationally, superior, to, the, indigenous, peoples, the, americo, liberians, developed, as, an, elite, minority, that, created, and, held, on, to, political, power, the, americo, liberian, settlers, adopted, clothing, such, as, hoop, skirts, and, tailcoats, and, generally, viewed, themselves, as, culturally, and, socially, superior, to, indigenous, africans, indigenous, tribesmen, did, not, enjoy, birthright, citizenship, in, their, own, land, until, 1904, americo, liberians, encouraged, religious, organizations, to, set, up, missions, and, schools, to, educate, the, indigenous, peoples, on, july, 26, 1847, the, settlers, issued, a, declaration, of, independence, and, promulgated, a, constitution, based, on, the, political, principles, of, the, united, states, constitution, it, established, the, independent, republic, of, liberia, on, august, 24, liberia, adopted, its, 11, striped, national, flag, the, united, kingdom, was, the, first, country, to, recognize, liberia, s, independence, the, united, states, did, not, recognize, liberia, until, 1862, after, the, southern, states, which, had, strong, political, power, in, the, american, government, declared, their, secession, and, the, formation, of, the, confederacy, the, leadership, of, the, new, nation, consisted, largely, of, the, americo, liberians, who, at, the, beginning, established, political, and, economic, dominance, in, the, coastal, areas, that, the, acs, had, purchased, they, maintained, relations, with, the, united, states, and,
