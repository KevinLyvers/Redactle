lake, ontario, is, one, of, the, five, great, lakes, of, north, america, it, is, bounded, on, the, north, west, and, southwest, by, the, canadian, province, of, ontario, and, on, the, south, and, east, by, the, u, s, state, of, new, york, the, canada, united, states, border, spans, the, centre, of, the, lake, the, canadian, cities, of, hamilton, kingston, mississauga, and, toronto, are, located, on, the, lake, s, northern, shorelines, while, the, canadian, city, of, st, catharines, and, the, american, city, of, rochester, are, located, on, the, south, shore, in, the, huron, language, the, name, ontar, io, means, great, lake, its, primary, inlet, is, the, niagara, river, from, lake, erie, the, last, in, the, great, lakes, chain, lake, ontario, serves, as, the, outlet, to, the, atlantic, ocean, via, the, saint, lawrence, river, comprising, the, western, end, of, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, the, long, sault, control, dam, primarily, along, with, the, moses, saunders, power, dam, regulates, the, water, level, of, the, lake, lake, ontario, is, the, easternmost, of, the, great, lakes, and, the, smallest, in, surface, area, 7, 340, sq, mi, 19, 000, km, 2, although, it, exceeds, lake, erie, in, volume, 393, cu, mi, 1, 640, km, 3, it, is, the, 13th, largest, lake, in, the, world, when, its, islands, are, included, the, lake, s, shoreline, is, 712, miles, 1, 146, km, long, as, the, last, lake, in, the, great, lakes, hydrologic, chain, lake, ontario, has, the, lowest, mean, surface, elevation, of, the, lakes, at, 243, feet, 74, m, above, sea, level, 326, feet, 99, m, lower, than, its, neighbor, upstream, its, maximum, length, is, 193, statute, miles, 311, kilometres, 168, nautical, miles, and, its, maximum, width, is, 53, statute, miles, 85, km, 46, nmi, the, lake, s, average, depth, is, 47, fathoms, 1, foot, 283, ft, 86, m, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 133, fathoms, 4, feet, 802, ft, 244, m, the, lake, s, primary, source, is, the, niagara, river, draining, lake, erie, with, the, saint, lawrence, river, serving, as, the, outlet, the, drainage, basin, covers, 24, 720, square, miles, 64, 030, km, 2, as, with, all, the, great, lakes, water, levels, change, both, within, the, year, owing, to, seasonal, changes, in, water, input, and, among, years, owing, to, longer, term, trends, in, precipitation, these, water, level, fluctuations, are, an, integral, part, of, lake, ecology, and, produce, and, maintain, extensive, wetlands, the, lake, also, has, an, important, freshwater, fishery, although, it, has, been, negatively, affected, by, factors, including, overfishing, water, pollution, and, invasive, species, baymouth, bars, built, by, prevailing, winds, and, currents, have, created, a, significant, number, of, lagoons, and, sheltered, harbors, mostly, near, but, not, limited, to, prince, edward, county, ontario, and, the, easternmost, shores, perhaps, the, best, known, example, is, toronto, bay, chosen, as, the, site, of, the, upper, canada, capital, for, its, strategic, harbor, other, prominent, examples, include, hamilton, harbour, irondequoit, bay, presqu, ile, bay, and, sodus, bay, the, bars, themselves, are, the, sites, of, long, beaches, such, as, sandbanks, provincial, park, and, sandy, island, beach, state, park, these, sand, bars, are, often, associated, with, large, wetlands, which, support, large, numbers, of, plant, and, animal, species, as, well, as, providing, important, rest, areas, for, migratory, birds, presqu, ile, on, the, north, shore, of, lake, ontario, is, particularly, significant, in, this, regard, one, unique, feature, of, the, lake, is, the, z, shaped, bay, of, quinte, which, separates, prince, edward, county, from, the, ontario, mainland, save, for, a, 2, mile, 3, 2, km, isthmus, near, trenton, this, feature, also, supports, many, wetlands, and, aquatic, plants, as, well, as, associated, fisheries, major, rivers, draining, into, lake, ontario, include, the, niagara, river, don, river, humber, river, rouge, river, trent, river, cataraqui, river, genesee, river, oswego, river, black, river, little, salmon, river, and, the, salmon, river, the, lake, basin, was, carved, out, of, soft, weak, silurian, age, rocks, by, the, wisconsin, ice, sheet, during, the, last, ice, age, the, action, of, the, ice, occurred, along, the, pre, glacial, ontarian, river, valley, which, had, approximately, the, same, orientation, as, today, s, basin, material, that, was, pushed, southward, by, the, ice, sheet, left, landforms, such, as, drumlins, kames, and, moraines, both, on, the, modern, land, surface, and, the, lake, bottom, reorganizing, the, region, s, entire, drainage, system, as, the, ice, sheet, retreated, toward, the, north, it, still, dammed, the, st, lawrence, valley, outlet, so, the, lake, surface, was, at, a, higher, level, this, stage, is, known, as, lake, iroquois, during, that, time, the, lake, drained, through, present, day, syracuse, new, york, into, the, mohawk, river, thence, to, the, hudson, river, and, the, atlantic, the, shoreline, created, during, this, stage, can, be, easily, recognized, by, the, now, dry, beaches, and, wave, cut, hills, 10, to, 25, miles, 16, to, 40, km, from, the, present, shoreline, when, the, ice, finally, receded, from, the, st, lawrence, valley, the, outlet, was, below, sea, level, and, for, a, short, time, the, lake, became, a, bay, of, the, atlantic, ocean, in, association, with, the, champlain, sea, gradually, the, land, rebounded, from, the, release, of, the, weight, of, about, 6, 500, feet, 2, 000, m, of, ice, that, had, been, stacked, on, it, it, is, still, rebounding, about, 12, inches, 30, cm, per, century, in, the, st, lawrence, area, since, the, ice, receded, from, the, area, last, the, most, rapid, rebound, still, occurs, there, this, means, the, lake, bed, is, gradually, tilting, southward, inundating, the, south, shore, and, turning, river, valleys, into, bays, both, north, and, south, shores, experience, shoreline, erosion, but, the, tilting, amplifies, this, effect, on, the, south, shore, causing, loss, to, property, owners, the, lake, has, a, natural, seiche, rhythm, of, eleven, minutes, the, seiche, effect, normally, is, only, about, 3, 4, inch, 1, 9, cm, but, can, be, greatly, amplified, by, earth, movement, winds, and, atmospheric, pressure, changes, because, of, its, great, depth, the, lake, as, a, whole, does, not, completely, freeze, in, winter, but, an, ice, sheet, covering, between, 10, and, 90, of, the, lake, area, typically, develops, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, winter, ice, sheets, typically, form, along, the, shoreline, and, in, slack, water, bays, where, the, lake, is, not, as, deep, during, the, winters, of, 1877, and, 1878, the, ice, sheet, coverage, was, up, to, 95, 100, of, the, lake, during, the, war, of, 1812, the, ice, cover, was, stable, enough, the, american, naval, commander, stationed, at, sackets, harbor, feared, a, british, attack, from, kingston, over, the, ice, the, lake, has, completely, frozen, over, on, five, recorded, occasions, in, 1830, 1874, 1893, 1912, and, 1934, when, the, cold, winds, of, winter, pass, over, the, warmer, water, of, the, lake, they, pick, up, moisture, and, drop, it, as, lake, effect, snow, since, the, prevailing, winter, winds, are, from, the, northwest, the, southern, and, southeastern, shoreline, of, the, lake, is, referred, to, as, the, snowbelt, in, some, winters, the, area, between, oswego, and, pulaski, may, receive, twenty, or, more, feet, 600, cm, of, snowfall, also, impacted, by, lake, effect, snow, is, the, tug, hill, plateau, an, area, of, elevated, land, about, 20, miles, 32, km, east, of, lake, ontario, the, hill, as, it, is, often, referred, to, typically, receives, more, snow, than, any, other, region, in, the, eastern, united, states, as, a, result, tug, hill, is, a, popular, location, for, winter, enthusiasts, such, as, snow, mobilers, and, cross, country, skiers, lake, effect, snow, often, extends, inland, as, far, as, syracuse, with, that, city, often, recording, the, most, winter, snowfall, accumulation, of, any, large, city, in, the, united, states, other, cities, in, the, world, receive, more, snow, annually, such, as, quebec, city, which, averages, 135, inches, 340, cm, and, sapporo, japan, which, receives, 250, inches, 640, cm, each, year, and, is, often, regarded, as, the, snowiest, city, in, the, world, foggy, conditions, particularly, in, fall, can, be, created, by, thermal, contrasts, and, can, be, an, impediment, for, recreational, boaters, lake, breezes, in, spring, tend, to, retard, fruit, bloom, until, the, frost, danger, is, past, and, in, the, autumn, delay, the, onset, of, fall, frost, particularly, on, the, south, shore, cool, onshore, winds, also, retard, the, early, bloom, of, plants, and, flowers, until, later, in, the, spring, season, protecting, them, from, possible, frost, damage, such, microclimatic, effects, have, enabled, tender, fruit, production, in, a, continental, climate, with, the, southwest, shore, supporting, a, major, fruit, growing, area, apples, cherries, pears, plums, and, peaches, are, grown, in, many, commercial, orchards, around, rochester, between, stoney, creek, and, niagara, on, the, lake, on, the, niagara, peninsula, is, a, major, fruit, growing, and, wine, making, area, the, wine, growing, region, extends, over, the, international, border, into, niagara, and, orleans, counties, in, new, york, apple, varieties, that, tolerate, a, more, extreme, climate, are, grown, on, the, lake, s, north, shore, around, cobourg, the, great, lakes, watershed, is, a, region, of, high, biodiversity, and, lake, ontario, is, important, for, its, diversity, of, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and, plants, many, of, these, special, species, are, associated, with, shorelines, particularly, sand, dunes, lagoons, and, wetlands, the, importance, of, wetlands, to, the, lake, has, been, appreciated, and, many, of, the, larger, wetlands, have, protected, status, these, wetlands, are, changing, partly, because, the, natural, water, level, fluctuations, have, been, reduced, many, wetland, plants, are, dependent, upon, low, water, levels, to, reproduce, when, water, levels, are, stabilized, the, area, and, diversity, of, the, marsh, is, reduced, this, is, particularly, true, of, meadow, marsh, also, known, as, wet, meadow, wetlands, for, example, in, eel, bay, near, alexandria, bay, regulation, of, lake, levels, has, resulted, in, large, losses, of, wet, meadow, often, this, is, accompanied, by, the, invasion, of, cattails, which, displace, many, of, the, native, plant, species, and, reduce, plant, diversity, eutrophication, may, accelerate, this, process, by, providing, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, for, the, more, rapid, growth, of, competitively, dominant, plants, similar, effects, are, occurring, on, the, north, shore, in, wetlands, such, as, presqu, ile, which, have, interdunal, wetlands, called, pannes, with, high, plant, diversity, and, many, unusual, plant, species, most, of, the, forests, around, the, lake, are, deciduous, forests, dominated, by, trees, including, maple, oak, beech, ash, and, basswood, these, are, classified, as, part, of, the, mixedwood, plains, ecozone, by, environment, canada, or, as, the, eastern, great, lakes, and, hudson, lowlands, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, or, as, the, great, lakes, ecoregion, by, the, nature, conservancy, deforestation, in, the, vicinity, of, the, lake, has, had, many, negative, impacts, including, loss, of, forest, birds, extinction, of, native, salmon, and, increased, amounts, of, sediment, flowing, into, the, lake, in, some, areas, more, than, 90, percent, of, the, forest, cover, has, been, removed, and, replaced, by, agriculture, certain, tree, species, such, as, hemlock, have, also, been, particularly, depleted, by, past, logging, activity, guidelines, for, restoration, stress, the, importance, of, maintaining, and, restoring, forest, cover, particularly, along, streams, and, wetlands, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, increased, pollution, caused, frequent, algal, blooms, to, occur, in, the, summer, these, blooms, killed, large, numbers, of, fish, and, left, decomposing, piles, of, filamentous, algae, and, dead, fish, along, the, shores, lake, ontario, is, the, most, downstream, lake, of, the, great, lakes, so, the, pollution, from, all, the, other, lakes, flows, into, it, lake, ontario, was, ranked, as, the, most, environmentally, stressed, amongst, the, five, great, lakes, in, a, 2015, ecological, study, some, of, the, stresses, on, the, lake, include, excess, application, of, fertilizers, in, agriculture, running, into, the, lake, spillover, from, obsolete, municipal, sewage, systems, toxic, chemicals, from, industries, along, the, rivers, that, drain, into, the, lake, and, metropolitan, drainage, from, big, cities, like, toronto, rochester, and, hamilton, randle, reef, the, westernmost, part, of, lake, ontario, has, been, identified, as, one, of, the, most, contaminated, areas, on, lake, ontario, alongside, other, areas, of, concern, on, great, lakes, however, a, 150, million, cleanup, project, had, begun, in, 2016, and, is, expected, to, be, completed, by, 2025, the, name, ontario, is, derived, from, the, huron, word, ontar, io, which, means, great, lake, in, colonial, times, the, lake, was, also, called, cataraqui, a, french, spelling, of, the, mohawk, katarokwi, the, lake, was, a, border, between, the, huron, people, and, the, iroquois, confederacy, in, the, pre, columbian, era, in, the, 17th, century, the, iroquois, drove, out, the, huron, from, southern, ontario, and, settled, the, northern, shores, of, lake, ontario, when, the, iroquois, withdrew, and, the, anishnabeg, ojibwa, mississaugas, moved, in, from, the, north, to, southern, ontario, they, retained, the, iroquois, name, artifacts, believed, to, be, of, norse, origin, have, been, found, in, the, area, of, sodus, bay, indicating, the, possibility, of, trading, by, the, indigenous, peoples, with, norse, explorers, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, it, is, believed, the, first, european, to, reach, the, lake, was, tienne, br, l, in, 1615, as, was, their, practice, the, french, explorers, introduced, other, names, for, the, lake, in, 1632, and, 1656, the, lake, was, referred, to, as, lac, de, st, louis, or, lake, st, louis, by, samuel, de, champlain, and, cartographer, nicolas, sanson, respectively, in, 1660, jesuit, historian, francis, creuxius, coined, the, name, lacus, ontarius, in, a, map, drawn, in, the, relation, des, j, suites, 1662, 1663, the, lake, bears, the, legend, lac, ontario, ou, des, iroquois, with, the, name, ondiara, in, smaller, type, a, french, map, produced, in, 1712, currently, in, the, canadian, museum, of, history, created, by, military, engineer, jean, baptiste, de, couagne, identified, lake, ontario, as, lac, frontenac, named, after, louis, de, buade, comte, de, frontenac, et, de, palluau, he, was, a, french, soldier, courtier, and, governor, general, of, new, france, from, 1672, to, 1682, and, from, 1689, to, his, death, in, 1698, in, the, 17th, century, reports, of, an, alleged, creature, named, gaasyendietha, similar, to, the, so, called, loch, ness, monster, being, sighted, in, the, lake, the, creature, is, described, as, large, with, a, long, neck, green, in, colour, and, generally, causes, a, break, in, the, surface, waves, a, series, of, trading, posts, were, established, by, both, the, british, and, french, such, as, fort, frontenac, in, 1673, fort, oswego, in, 1722, and, fort, rouill, in, 1750, as, the, easternmost, and, nearest, lake, to, the, atlantic, seaboard, of, canada, and, the, united, states, population, centres, here, are, among, the, oldest, in, the, great, lakes, basin, with, kingston, ontario, formerly, the, capital, of, canada, dating, to, the, establishment, of, fort, frontenac, in, 1673, after, the, french, and, indian, war, all, forts, around, the, lake, were, under, british, control, the, united, states, took, possession, of, the, forts, along, the, american, side, of, the, lake, at, the, signing, of, the, jay, treaty, in, 1794, permanent, non, military, european, settlement, began, during, the, american, revolution, with, the, influx, of, loyalist, settlers, during, the, war, of, 1812, the, royal, navy, and, us, navy, had, fought, in, several, engagements, for, control, of, lake, ontario, the, great, lakes, including, lake, ontario, were, largely, demilitarized, after, the, rush, bagot, treaty, was, ratified, in, 1818, the, lake, became, a, hub, of, commercial, activity, following, the, war, of, 1812, with, canal, building, on, both, sides, of, the, border, and, heavy, travel, by, lake, steamers, steamer, activity, peaked, in, the, mid, 19th, century, before, competition, from, railway, lines, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, type, of, scow, known, as, a, stone, hooker, was, in, operation, on, the, northwest, shore, particularly, around, port, credit, and, bronte, stonehooking, was, the, practice, of, raking, flat, fragments, of, dundas, shale, from, the, shallow, lake, floor, of, the, area, for, use, in, construction, particularly, in, the, growing, city, of, toronto, as, of, 2012, nearly, 50, people, have, successfully, swum, across, the, lake, the, first, person, who, accomplished, the, feat, was, a, canadian, long, distance, swimmer, marilyn, bell, who, did, it, in, 1954, at, age, 16, toronto, s, marilyn, bell, park, is, named, in, her, honour, the, park, opened, in, 1984, and, is, east, of, the, spot, where, bell, completed, her, swim, in, 1974, diana, nyad, became, the, first, person, who, swam, across, the, lake, against, the, current, from, north, to, south, on, august, 28, 2007, 14, year, old, natalie, lambert, from, kingston, ontario, made, the, swim, leaving, sackets, harbor, new, york, and, reaching, kingston, s, confederation, basin, less, than, 24, hours, after, she, entered, the, lake, on, august, 19, 2012, 14, year, old, annaleise, carr, became, the, youngest, person, to, swim, across, the, lake, she, completed, the, 32, mile, 52, km, crossing, from, niagara, on, the, lake, to, marilyn, bell, park, in, just, under, 27, hours, a, large, conurbation, called, the, golden, horseshoe, occupies, the, lake, s, westernmost, shores, anchored, by, the, cities, of, toronto, and, hamilton, ports, on, the, canadian, side, include, st, catharines, oshawa, cobourg, and, kingston, near, the, st, lawrence, river, outlet, close, to, 9, million, people, or,
