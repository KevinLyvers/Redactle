southeast, asian, crops, including, coconuts, giant, swamp, taro, and, breadfruit, as, well, as, domesticated, chickens, which, made, the, islands, permanently, habitable, several, spanish, expeditions, visited, the, islands, in, the, mid, 16th, century, but, spanish, galleons, usually, sailed, a, pacific, route, farther, north, and, avoided, the, marshalls, european, maps, and, charts, named, the, group, for, british, captain, john, marshall, who, explored, the, region, in, 1788, american, protestant, missionaries, and, western, business, interests, began, arriving, in, the, 1850s,

a, plan, for, increased, self, governance, of, pacific, islands, in, may, 1979, the, united, states, gave, the, marshall, islands, independence, by, recognizing, its, constitution, and, president, amata, kabua, full, sovereignty, or, self, government, was, achieved, in, a, compact, of, free, association, with, the, united, states, marshall, islands, has, been, a, member, of, the, pacific, community, pc, since, 1983, and, a, united, nations, member, state, since, 1991, politically, the, marshall, islands, is, a, parliamentary, republic, with, an, executive, presidency, in, free, association, with, the, united, states, with, the, u, s, providing, defense, subsidies, and, access, to, u, s, based, agencies, such, as, the, federal, communications, commission, and, the, united, states, postal, service, with, few, natural, resources, the, islands, wealth, is, based, on, a, service, economy, as, well, as, fishing, and, agriculture, aid, from, the, united, states, represents, a, large, percentage, of, the, islands, gross, domestic, product, and, although, most, financial, aid, from, the, compact, of, free, association, was, set, to, expire, in, 2023, it, was, extended, for, another, 20, years, that, same, year, the, country, uses, the, united, states, dollar, as, its, currency, in, 2018, it, also, announced, plans, for, a, new, cryptocurrency, to, be, used, as, legal, tender, the, majority, of, the, citizens, of, the, republic, of, marshall, islands, are, of, marshallese, descent, though, there, are, small, numbers, of, immigrants, from, the, united, states, china, philippines, and, other, pacific, islands, the, two, official, languages, are, marshallese, which, is, one, of, the, oceanic, languages, and, english, almost, the, entire, population, of, the, islands, practices, some, religion, three, quarters, of, the, country, follows, either, the, united, church, of, christ, congregational, in, the, marshall, islands, ucccmi, or, the, assemblies, of, god, linguistic, and, anthropological, studies, have, suggested, that, the, first, austronesian, settlers, of, the, marshall, islands, arrived, from, the, solomon, islands, radiocarbon, dating, suggests, that, bikini, atoll, may, have, been, inhabited, as, early, as, 1200, bce, though, samples, may, not, have, been, collected, from, secure, stratigraphic, contexts, and, older, driftwood, samples, may, have, affected, results, archaeological, digs, on, other, atolls, have, found, evidence, of, human, habitation, dating, around, the, 1st, century, ce, at, the, village, of, laura, on, majuro, and, on, kwajalein, atoll, the, austronesian, settlers, introduced, southeast, asian, crops, including, coconuts, giant, swamp, taro, and, breadfruit, as, well, as, domesticated, chickens, throughout, the, marshall, islands, they, possibly, seeded, the, islands, by, leaving, coconuts, at, seasonal, fishing, camps, before, permanently, settling, years, later, the, southern, islands, receive, heavier, rainfall, than, the, north, so, communities, in, the, wet, south, subsisted, on, prevalent, taro, and, breadfruit, while, northerners, were, more, likely, to, subsist, on, pandanus, and, coconuts, southern, atolls, probably, supported, larger, more, dense, populations, the, marshallese, sailed, between, islands, on, walaps, made, from, breadfruit, tree, wood, and, coconut, fiber, rope, they, navigated, by, using, the, stars, for, orientation, and, initial, course, setting, but, also, developed, a, piloting, technique, of, interpreting, disruptions, in, ocean, swells, to, determine, the, location, of, low, coral, atolls, below, the, horizon, they, noticed, that, swells, refracted, around, the, undersea, slope, of, atolls, when, refracted, swells, from, different, directions, met, they, created, noticeable, disruption, patterns, which, marshallese, pilots, could, read, to, determine, the, direction, of, an, island, when, interviewed, by, anthropologists, some, marshallese, sailors, noted, that, they, piloted, their, canoes, by, both, sight, and, feeling, changes, in, the, motion, of, the, boat, sailors, also, invented, stick, charts, to, map, the, swell, patterns, but, unlike, western, navigational, charts, the, marshallese, stick, charts, were, tools, for, teaching, students, and, for, consultation, before, embarking, on, a, voyage, navigators, did, not, take, charts, with, them, when, they, set, sail, when, russian, explorer, otto, von, kotzebue, visited, the, marshalls, in, 1817, the, islanders, still, showed, few, signs, of, western, influence, he, observed, that, the, marshallese, lived, in, thatched, roof, huts, but, their, villages, did, not, include, the, large, ornate, meeting, houses, found, in, other, parts, of, micronesia, they, did, not, have, furniture, except, for, woven, mats, which, they, used, for, both, floor, coverings, and, clothing, the, marshallese, had, pierced, ears, and, tattoos, he, learned, that, marshallese, families, practiced, infanticide, after, the, birth, of, a, third, child, as, a, form, of, population, planning, due, to, frequent, famines, he, also, noted, that, marshallese, iroij, held, considerable, authority, and, rights, to, all, property, though, he, had, a, more, favorable, view, of, the, condition, of, marshallese, commoners, than, of, that, of, polynesian, commoners, the, marshalls, two, island, groups, the, ratak, and, ralik, chains, were, each, ruled, by, a, paramount, chief, or, iroijlaplap, who, held, authority, over, the, individual, island, iroij, on, august, 21, 1526, spanish, explorer, alonso, de, salazar, was, the, first, european, to, sight, the, marshall, islands, while, commanding, the, santa, maria, de, la, victoria, he, sighted, an, atoll, with, a, green, lagoon, which, may, have, been, taongi, the, crew, could, not, land, because, of, strong, currents, and, water, too, deep, for, the, ship, s, anchor, so, the, ship, sailed, for, guam, two, days, later, on, january, 2, 1528, the, expedition, of, lvaro, de, saavedra, cer, n, landed, on, an, uninhabited, island, possibly, in, ailinginae, atoll, where, they, resupplied, and, stayed, for, six, days, natives, from, a, neighboring, island, briefly, met, the, spanish, this, expedition, named, the, islands, los, pintados, or, the, painted, ones, for, the, natives, who, wore, tattoos, later, spanish, explorers, of, the, marshalls, included, ruy, l, pez, de, villalobos, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, alonso, de, arellano, and, lvaro, de, menda, a, de, neira, though, coordinates, and, geographic, descriptions, in, 16th, century, spanish, logs, are, sometimes, imprecise, leaving, uncertainty, about, the, specific, islands, they, sighted, and, visited, on, july, 6, 1565, the, spanish, ship, san, jeronimo, nearly, wrecked, at, ujelang, atoll, after, the, ship, s, pilot, lope, mart, n, led, a, mutiny, while, the, mutineers, were, resupplying, at, ujelang, several, crew, members, took, back, control, of, the, ship, and, marooned, mart, n, and, twenty, six, other, mutineers, in, the, marshalls, by, the, late, 16th, century, spanish, galleons, sailing, between, the, americas, and, the, philippines, kept, to, a, sea, lane, at, 13, n, and, provisioned, at, guam, avoiding, the, marshalls, which, spanish, sailors, saw, as, unprofitable, islands, amid, hazardous, waters, the, british, sea, captains, john, marshall, and, thomas, gilbert, visited, the, islands, in, 1788, their, vessels, had, been, part, of, the, first, fleet, taking, convicts, from, england, to, botany, bay, in, new, south, wales, and, were, en, route, to, guangzhou, when, they, passed, through, the, gilbert, islands, and, marshall, islands, on, june, 25, 1788, the, british, ships, had, peaceful, interactions, and, traded, with, islanders, at, mili, atoll, their, meeting, may, have, been, the, first, contact, between, europeans, and, marshallese, since, the, menda, a, expedition, of, 1568, subsequent, navigational, charts, and, maps, named, the, islands, for, john, marshall, from, the, 1820s, through, the, 1850s, the, marshall, islanders, became, increasingly, hostile, to, western, vessels, possibly, because, of, violent, punishments, that, sea, captains, exacted, for, theft, as, well, as, the, abduction, of, marshallese, people, for, sale, into, slavery, on, pacific, plantations, one, of, the, earliest, violent, encounters, occurred, in, february, 1824, when, the, inhabitants, of, mili, atoll, massacred, marooned, sailors, from, the, american, whaler, globe, similar, encounters, occurred, as, late, as, 1851, and, 1852, when, three, separate, marshallese, attacks, on, ships, occurred, at, ebon, jaluit, and, namdrik, atolls, in, 1857, american, board, of, commissioners, for, foreign, missions, sent, two, families, to, establish, a, mission, church, and, school, at, ebon, by, 1875, the, missionaries, had, established, churches, on, five, atolls, and, had, baptized, more, than, 200, islanders, and, one, traveler, noted, that, most, women, on, ebon, wore, western, clothes, and, many, men, wore, trousers, by, the, mid, 1870s, in, 1859, adolph, capelle, and, another, merchant, arrived, at, ebon, and, set, up, a, trading, post, for, the, german, company, hoffschlaeger, stapenhorst, when, the, firm, went, bankrupt, in, 1863, capelle,

syphilis, and, typhoid, fever, increased, access, to, alcohol, led, to, social, problems, in, some, marshallese, communities, and, on, several, atolls, conflicts, erupted, between, rival, iroij, with, access, to, firearms, in, 1875, the, british, and, german, governments, conducted, a, series, of, secret, negotiations, to, divide, the, western, pacific, into, spheres, of, influence, the, german,
