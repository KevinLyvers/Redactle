group, of, many, islands, including, cape, horn, and, diego, ram, rez, islands, tierra, del, fuego, is, divided, between, argentina, which, controls, the, eastern, part, of, the, main, island, and, a, few, small, islands, in, the, beagle, channel, and, chile, which, controls, the, remaining, land, area, the, southernmost, extent, of, the, archipelago, is, just, north, of, latitude, 56, s, the, earliest, known, human, settlement, in, tierra, del, fuego, dates, to, approximately, 8, 000, bc, europeans, first, explored, the, islands, during, ferdinand, magellan, s, expedition, of, 1520, tierra, del, fuego, and, similar, namings, stem, from, sightings, of, the, many, bonfires, that, the, natives, built, settlement, by, those, of, european, descent, and, the, displacement, of, the, native, populations, did, not, begin, until, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, at, the, height, of, the, patagonian, sheep, farming, boom, and, of, the, local, gold, rush, today,

visible, from, the, sea, and, that, the, indians, were, waiting, in, the, forests, to, ambush, his, armada, in, 1525, francisco, de, hoces, was, the, first, to, speculate, that, tierra, del, fuego, was, one, or, more, islands, rather, than, part, of, what, was, then, called, terra, australis, francis, drake, in, 1578, and, a, dutch, east, india, company, expedition, in, 1616, learned, more, about, the, geography, the, latter, expedition, named, cape, horn, at, hornos, island, on, his, first, voyage, with, hms, beagle, in, 1830, robert, fitzroy, picked, up, four, native, fuegians,

ethnological, work, an, 1879, chilean, expedition, led, by, ram, n, serrano, montaner, reported, large, amounts, of, placer, gold, in, the, streams, and, river, beds, of, tierra, del, fuego, this, prompted, massive, immigration, to, the, main, island, between, 1883, and, 1909, numerous, argentines, chileans, and, croatians, settled, on, the, main, island, leading, to, increased, conflicts, with, native, selk, nam, these, late, nineteenth, century, gold, rushes, led, to, the, founding, of, numerous, small, settlements, by, immigrants, such, as, the, argentine, settlements, of, ushuaia, and, r, o, grande, and, the, chilean, settlements, of, porvenir, and, puerto, toro, julius, popper, a, romanian, explorer, was, one, of, the, most, successful, entrepreneurs, in, the, region, granted, rights, by, the, argentine, government, to, exploit, any, gold, deposits, he, found, in, tierra, del, fuego, popper, has, been, identified, as, a, central, figure, in, the, selk, nam, genocide, following, contact, with, europeans, the, native, selk, nam, and, yaghan, populations, were, greatly, reduced, by, unequal, conflict, and, persecution, by, settlers, by, infectious, diseases, to, which, the, indigenous, people, had, no, immunity, and, by, mass, transfer, to, the, salesian, mission, of, dawson, island, despite, the, efforts, of, the, missionaries, many, natives, died, today, only, a, few, selk, nam, remain, some, of, the, few, remaining, yaghan, have, settled, in, villa, ukika, in, navarino, island, others, have, scattered, throughout, chile, and, argentina, following,

while, mount, darwin, had, previously, been, thought, to, be, the, tallest, mountain, in, the, archipelago, this, distinction, now, belongs, to, the, unofficially, named, monte, shipton, at, 2, 580, metres, 8, 460, feet, the, topography, of, tierra, del, fuego, can, be, divided, into, four, regions, an, outer, archipelago, region, spanish, regi, n, archipiel, gica, to, the, south, and, west, a, mountainous, region, in, the, south, spanish, regi, n, cordillerana, a, plains, region, spanish, regi, n, de, las, planicies, orientales, plus, a, sub, andean, zone, in, between, the, last, two, zones, spanish, regi, n, sub, andina, oriental, the, geology, of, the, archipelago, is, influenced, by, the, effects, of, the, andean, orogeny, and, the, repeated, pleistocene, glaciations, the, geology, of, the, island, can, be, divided, into, large, east, west, oriented, units, the, southwestern, islands, of, the, archipelago, including, cape, horn, are, part, of, the, south, patagonian, batholith, while, the, cordillera, darwin, and, the, area, around, the, beagle, channel, form, the, principal, mountain, range, hosting, the, highest, mountains, the, magallanes, fold, and, thrust,

a, southern, belt, of, paleozoic, meta, sediments, and, a, northern, mesozoic, belt, of, sedimentary, sequences, fagnano, lake, occupies, a, glacier, carved, depression, in, a, pull, apart, basin, that, has, developed, along, the, magallanes, fagnano, fault, zone, podzols, and, inceptisols, occur, beneath, nothofagus, betuloides, forests, in, tierra, del, fuego, the, tierra, del, fuego, region, has, a, subpolar, oceanic, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, cfc, with, short, cool, summers, and, long, wet, moderately, mild, winters, the, precipitation, averages, 3, 000, mm, 118, in, a, year, in, the, far, west, but, precipitation, decreases, rapidly, towards, the, eastern, side, temperatures, are, steady, throughout, the, year, in, ushuaia, they, hardly, surpass, 9, c, 48, f, in, summers, and, average, 0, c, 32, f, in, winters, snowfall, can, occur, in, summer, the, cold, and, wet, summers, help, preserve, the, ancient, glaciers, the, southernmost, islands, possess, a, sub, antarctic, climate, typical, of, tundra, that, makes, the, growth, of, trees, impossible, some, areas, in, the, interior, have, a, polar, climate, regions, in, the, world, with, similar, climates, to, southern, tierra, del, fuego, are, the, aleutian, islands, iceland, the, alaska, peninsula, the, faroe, islands, macquarie, island, and, the, heard, and, mcdonald, islands, only, 30, of, the, islands, have, forests, which, are, classified, as, magellanic, subpolar, the, northeastern, portion, of, the, region, is, made, up, of, steppe, and, cool, semi, desert, six, species, of, tree, are, found, in,

chiloensis, var, chiloensis, forma, chiloensis, and, calafate, berberis, buxifolia, which, have, long, been, gathered, by, both, native, americans, and, residents, of, european, descent, they, are, the, only, forests, in, the, world, to, have, developed, in, a, climate, with, such, cold, summers, tree, cover, extends, very, close, to, the, southernmost, tip, of, south, america, winds, are, so, strong, that, trees, in, wind, exposed, areas, grow, into, twisted, shapes, inspiring, people, to, call, them, flag, trees, tree, vegetation, extends, to, the, southern, tip, of, the, region, isla, hornos, although, the, wollaston, islands, are, mostly, covered, by, subantarctic, tundra, except, in, wind, sheltered, areas, where, the, trees, can, survive, forests, from, tierra, del, fuego, have, expanded, beyond, local, importance, these, forests, have, been, a, source, of, trees, that, have, been, transplanted, abroad, in, places, with, similar, climate, but, which, originally, were, devoid, of, trees, such, as, the, faroe, islands, and, nearby, archipelagos, most, species, were, gathered, from, the, coldest, places, in, tierra, del, fuego, mainly, sites, with, tundra, borders, this, effort, resulted, in, positive, changes, as, the, heavy, winds, and, cool, summers, in, the, faroe, islands, did, not, allow, the, growth, of, trees, from, other, regions, in, the, world, the, imported, trees, are, used, ornamentally, as, curtains, against, wind, and, to, fight, erosion, caused, by, storms, and, grazing, in, the, faroe, islands, among, the, most, notable, animals, in, the, archipelago, are, austral, parakeets, gulls, guanacos, south, american, foxes, kingfishers, andean, condors, king, penguins, owls, and, firecrown, hummingbirds, isla, grande, de, tierra, del, fuego,

considerable, damage, to, the, island, forests, the, governments, have, established, a, wide, reaching, program, to, trap, and, kill, beavers, in, tierra, del, fuego, like, the, mainland, of, chile, and, argentina, to, the, north, this, archipelago, boasts, some, of, the, finest, trout, fishing, in, the, world, sea, run, brown, trout, often, exceed, 9, kg, 20, lb, particularly, in, rivers, such, as, the, rio, grande, and, the, san, pablo, and, in, the, lago, fagnano, waters, adjacent, to, tierra, del, fuego, are, very, rich, in, cetacean, diversity, sightings, of, southern, right, whales, in,

mammal, that, is, not, a, cetacean, today, the, main, economic, activities, of, the, archipelago, are, fishing, extraction, of, natural, gas, and, oil, sheep, farming, and, ecotourism, tourism, is, gaining, increasing, importance, as, it, attracts, numerous, upmarket, visitors, much, of, the, tourism, is, based, on, southernmost, claims, for, example, both, ushuaia, and, puerto, williams, claim, to, be, the, southernmost, city, in, the, world, on, the, argentine, side, of, tierra, del, fuego, the, government, has, promoted, the, establishment, of, several, electronic, companies, via, tax,
