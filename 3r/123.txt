the, caspian, sea, at, its, greatest, extent, it, was, the, largest, lake, in, the, middle, east, it, is, the, sixth, largest, saltwater, lake, on, earth, with, a, surface, area, of, approximately, 6, 000, km, 2, 2, 300, sq, mi, a, length, of, 140, km, 87, mi, a, width, of, 70, km, 43, mi, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 20, m, 66, ft, by, late, 2017, the, lake, had, shrunk, to, 10, of, its, former, size, and, 1, 60, of, water, volume, in, 1998, due, to, persistent, general, drought, in, iran, but, also, the, damming, of, the, local, rivers, that, flow, into, it, and, the, pumping, of, groundwater, from, the, surrounding, area, this, dry, spell, was, broken, in, 2019, and, the, lake, is, now, filling, up, once, again, due, to, both, increased, rain, and, water, diversion, from, the, zab, river, under, the, urmia, lake, research, programme, lake, urmia, along, with, its, approximately, 102, former, islands, is, protected, as, a, national, park, by, the, iranian, department, of,

tepe, is, a, prehistoric, site, on, the, east, shore, of, lake, urmia, that, has, been, excavated, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, by, c, a, burney, this, area, has, been, settled, as, far, back, as, 6000, bc, there, s, a, large, group, of, sites, south, of, lake, urmia, that, have, been, excavated, they, include, dalma, tepe, teppe, hasanlu, and, geoy, tepe, hajji, firuz, tepe, may, have, been, the, earliest, of, these, sites, se, girdan, kurgans, are, located, on, the, south, shore, of, lake, urmia, some, of, them, were, excavated, in, 1968, and, 1970, by, o, muscarella, they, have, now, been, redated, to, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, millennium, although, originally, they, were, thought, to, be, much, younger, one, of, the, early, mentions, of, lake, urmia, is, from, assyrian,

concentration, of, natural, seawater, the, lake, is, divided, into, north, and, south, separated, by, the, urmia, lake, bridge, and, its, associated, causeway, which, was, completed, in, 2008, the, bridge, provides, only, a, 1, 5, kilometre, 0, 93, mi, gap, in, the, embankment, allowing, little, exchange, of, water, between, the, two, sections, due, to, drought, and, increased, demands, for, agricultural, water, in, the, lake, s, basin, the, salinity, of, the, lake, has, risen, to, more, than, 300, g, l, during, recent, years, and, large, areas, of, the, lake, bed, have, been, desiccated, based, on, the, latest, checklists, of, biodiversity, at, lake, urmia, in, 2014, and, 2016, it, is, home, to, 62, species, of, archaebacteria, and, bacteria, 42, species, of, microfungi, 20, species,

has, designated, most, of, the, lake, as, a, national, park, a, recent, drought, has, significantly, decreased, the, annual, amount, of, water, the, lake, receives, this, in, turn, has, increased, the, salinity, of, the, lake, s, water, reducing, its, viability, as, home, to, thousands, of, migratory, birds, including, flamingo, populations, the, salinity, has, particularly, increased, in, the, half, of, the, lake, north, of, the, urmia, lake, bridge, by, virtue, of, its, high, salinity, the, lake, no, longer, sustains, any, fish, species, nonetheless, urmia, lake, is, considered, a, significant, natural, habitat, of, artemia, which, serve, as, food, source, for, the, migratory, birds, such, as, flamingos, in, early, 2013, the, then, head, of, the, iranian, artemia, research, center, was, quoted, that, artemia, urmiana, had, gone, extinct, due, to, the, drastic, increases, in, salinity, however, this, assessment, has, been, contradicted, and, another, population, of, this, species, has, recently, been, discovered, in, the, koyashskoye, salt, lake, at, the, crimean, peninsula, the, lake, is, a, major, barrier, between, urmia, and, tabriz, two, of, the, most, important, cities, in, the, provinces, of, west, azerbaijan, and, east, azerbaijan, a, project, to, build, a, highway, across, the, lake, was, initiated, in, the, 1970s, but, was, abandoned, after, the, iranian, revolution, of, 1979, leaving, a, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, causeway, with, an, unbridged, gap, the, project, was, revived, in, the, early, 2000s, and, was, completed, in, november, 2008, with, the, opening, of, the, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, urmia, lake, bridge, across, the, remaining, gap, the, highly, saline, environment, is, already, heavily, rusting, the, steel, on, the, bridge, despite, anti, corrosion, treatment, experts, have, warned, that, the, construction, of, the, causeway, and, bridge, together, with, a, series, of, ecological, factors, will, eventually, lead, to, the, drying, up, of, the, lake, turning, it, into, a, salt, marsh, which, will, adversely, affect, the, climate, of, the, region, lake, urmia, has, been, shrinking, for, a, long, time, with, an, annual, evaporation, rate, of, 0, 6, to, 1, m, 24, to, 39, in, although, measures, are, now, being, taken, to, reverse, the, trend, the, lake, has, shrunk, by, 60, and, could, disappear, entirely, only, 5, of, the, lake, s, water, remains, on, 2, august, 2012, muhammad, javad, muhammadizadeh, the, head, of, iran, s, environment, protection, organization, announced, that, armenia, had, agreed, to, transfer, water, to, counter, the, critical, fall, in, lake, urmia, s, water, level, remarking, that, hot, weather, and, a, lack, of, precipitation, have, brought, the, lake, to, its, lowest, water, levels, ever, recorded, he, added, that, recovery, plans, for, the, lake, included, the, transfer, of, water, from, eastern, azerbaijan, province, previously, iranian, authorities, had, announced, a, plan, to, transfer, water,
