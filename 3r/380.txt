mount, kenya, meru, k, r, maara, kikuyu, k, r, nyaga, kamba, ki, nyaa, embu, kirinyaa, is, an, extinct, volcano, in, kenya, and, the, second, highest, peak, in, africa, after, kilimanjaro, the, highest, peaks, of, the, mountain, are, batian, 5, 199, metres, 17, 057, feet, nelion, 5, 188, m, 17, 021, ft, and, point, lenana, 4, 985, m, 16, 355, ft, mount, kenya, is, located, in, the, former, eastern, and, central, provinces, of, kenya, its, peak, is, now, the, intersection, of, meru, embu, kirinyaga, nyeri, and, tharaka, nithi, counties, about, 16, 5, kilometres, 10, 3, miles, south, of, the, equator, around, 150, km, 90, mi, north, northeast, of, the, capital, nairobi, mount, kenya, is, the, source, of, the, name, of, the, republic, of, kenya, mount, kenya, is, a, volcano, created, approximately, 3, million, years, after, the, opening, of, the, east, african, rift, before, glaciation, it, was, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, high, it, was, covered, by, an, ice, cap, for, thousands, of, years, this, has, resulted, in, very, eroded, slopes, and, numerous, valleys, radiating, from, the, peak, there, are, currently, 11, small, glaciers, which, are, shrinking, rapidly, and, may, disappear, by, 2050, the, forested, slopes, are, an, important, source, of, water, for, much, of, kenya, there, are, several, vegetation, bands, from, the, base, to, the, peak, the, lower, slopes, are, covered, by, different, types, of, forest, many, alpine, species, are, endemic, to, mount, kenya, such, as, the, giant, lobelias, and, senecios, and, a, local, subspecies, of, rock, hyrax, an, area, of, 715, km, 2, 276, sq, mi, around, the, centre, of, the, mountain, was, designated, a, national, park, and, listed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1997, the, park, receives, over, 16, 000, visitors, per, year, mount, kenya, national, park, established, in, 1949, protects, the, region, surrounding, the, mountain, currently, the, national, park, is, within, the, forest, reserve, which, encircles, it, in, april, 1978, the, area, was, designated, a, unesco, biosphere, reserve, the, national, park, and, the, forest, reserve, combined, became, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1997, the, government, of, kenya, had, four, reasons, for, creating, a, national, park, on, and, around, mount, kenya, these, were, the, importance, of, tourism, for, the, local, and, national, economies, preserving, an, area, of, great, scenic, beauty, conserving, the, biodiversity, within, the, park, and, preserving, the, water, catchment, for, the, surrounding, area, kenya, s, government, has, announced, a, project, to, discourage, animals, from, straying, into, small, holdings, surrounding, the, park, and, devastating, crops, which, will, see, the, park, enclosed, by, an, electric, fence, with, five, electrified, strands, kenya, s, rhino, ark, trust, a, non, profit, organization, has, been, putting, up, fences, in, key, areas, around, the, country, as, of, 2021, 250, kilometres, 160, miles, out, of, a, planned, 450, kilometres, 280, miles, have, been, constructed, in, the, mt, kenya, area, the, fence, discharges, an, electric, shock, but, is, not, dangerous, to, humans, or, animals, the, main, ethnic, groups, living, around, mount, kenya, are, kikuyu, ameru, embu, and, maasai, the, first, three, are, closely, related, they, all, see, the, mountain, as, an, important, aspect, of, their, cultures, all, these, cultures, arrived, in, the, mount, kenya, area, in, the, last, several, hundred, years, the, kikuyu, people, live, on, the, southern, and, western, sides, of, the, mountain, they, are, agriculturalists, and, make, use, of, the, highly, fertile, volcanic, soil, on, the, lower, slopes, they, believe, that, god, ngai, or, mwene, nyaga, lived, on, mount, kenya, when, he, came, down, from, the, sky, they, believe, that, the, mountain, is, ngai, s, throne, on, earth, it, is, the, place, where, g, k, y, the, father, of, the, tribe, used, to, meet, with, god, thus, according, to, the, kikuyu, records, g, k, y, is, the, first, person, on, earth, to, ascend, the, mountain, mwene, nyaga, in, the, kikuyu, language, can, also, translate, as, the, owner, of, the, ostriches, or, owner, of, the, white, patches, of, snow, where, mwene, translates, to, owner, and, nyaga, to, ostriches, or, white, patches, the, snow, in, kikuyu, ira, caps, of, the, mountain, symbolically, represent, a, crown, on, god, s, habitation, kikuyu, used, to, build, their, houses, with, doors, facing, the, mountain, the, kikuyu, name, for, mount, kenya, is, kirima, k, r, nyaga, mt, kirinyaga, which, literally, translates, to, the, mountain, that, has, the, nyaga, ostriches, the, mountain, therefore, is, locally, accepted, as, god, s, resting, place, or, where, god, lives, the, kikuyu, name, for, mt, kenya, is, k, r, nyaga, which, literally, means, the, one, with, the, ostrich, the, ostrich, has, black, or, brownish, grey, feathers, with, patches, of, white, the, kikuyu, attributed, an, ostrich, s, likeness, to, an, object, that, was, dark, coloured, with, white, patches, the, name, k, r, nyaga, therefore, figuratively, means, the, one, with, white, patches, referring, to, the, glaciers, among, the, peaks, of, the, mountain, translated, to, the, kamba, language, k, r, nyaga, would, be, ki, nyaa, this, is, the, name, that, ludwig, krapf, was, given, when, he, sighted, the, mountain, from, kitui, in, kamba, country, he, recorded, it, as, kenya, it, became, the, name, of, not, only, the, mountain, but, also, the, country, the, embu, people, live, to, the, south, east, of, mount, kenya, and, believe, that, the, mountain, is, god, s, home, the, embu, word, for, god, is, ngai, or, mwene, njeru, the, embu, name, for, mount, kenya, is, kirenyaa, the, mountain, is, sacred, and, they, build, their, houses, with, the, doors, facing, toward, it, the, embu, people, are, closely, related, to, the, ameru, and, mbeere, people, the, mbeere, and, akamba, are, the, settlers, of, the, southeast, side, of, the, mountain, the, ameru, occupy, the, east, north, and, north, western, slopes, of, the, mountain, they, are, generally, agricultural, and, also, keep, livestock, and, occupy, what, is, among, the, most, fertile, land, in, kenya, the, meru, god, murungu, was, from, the, skies, their, name, for, mt, kenya, is, kirimaara, which, means, mountain, with, white, features, the, maasai, are, semi, nomadic, people, who, use, the, land, to, the, north, of, the, mountain, to, graze, their, cattle, they, believe, that, their, ancestors, came, down, from, the, mountain, at, the, beginning, of, time, the, maasai, name, for, mount, kenya, is, ol, donyo, keri, which, means, mountain, of, stripes, referring, to, the, dark, shades, as, observed, from, the, surrounding, plains, at, least, one, maasai, prayer, refers, to, mount, kenya, god, bless, our, children, let, them, be, like, the, olive, tree, of, morintat, let, them, grow, and, expand, let, them, be, like, ngong, hills, like, mt, kenya, like, mt, kilimanjaro, and, multiply, in, number, mount, kenya, is, a, stratovolcano, that, was, active, in, the, plio, pleistocene, the, original, crater, was, probably, over, 6, 000, m, 19, 700, ft, high, and, potentially, up, to, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, high, making, the, prehistoric, mount, kenya, higher, than, present, day, kilimanjaro, since, it, became, extinct, there, have, been, two, major, periods, of, glaciation, which, are, shown, by, two, main, rings, of, moraines, below, the, glaciers, the, lowest, moraine, is, found, at, around, 3, 300, m, 10, 800, ft, today, the, glaciers, reach, no, lower, than, 4, 650, m, 15, 260, ft, after, studying, the, moraines, gregory, put, forward, the, theory, that, at, one, time, the, whole, summit, of, the, mountain, was, covered, with, an, ice, cap, and, it, was, this, that, eroded, the, peaks, to, how, they, are, today, the, lower, slopes, of, the, mountain, have, never, been, glaciated, they, are, now, mainly, cultivated, and, forested, they, are, distinguished, by, steep, sided, v, shaped, valleys, with, many, tributaries, higher, up, the, mountain, in, the, area, that, is, now, moorland, the, valleys, become, u, shaped, and, shallower, with, flatter, bottoms, these, were, created, by, glaciation, when, mount, kenya, was, active, there, was, some, satellite, activity, the, northeastern, side, of, the, mountain, has, many, old, volcanic, plugs, and, craters, the, largest, of, these, ithanguni, even, had, its, own, ice, cap, when, the, main, peaks, were, covered, in, ice, this, can, be, seen, by, the, smoothed, summit, of, the, peak, circular, hills, with, steep, sides, are, also, frequent, in, this, area, which, are, probably, the, remains, of, small, plugged, vents, however, as, the, remaining, mountain, is, roughly, symmetrical, most, of, the, activity, must, have, occurred, at, the, central, plug, the, rocks, that, form, mount, kenya, are, mainly, basalts, rhomb, porphyrites, phonolites, kenytes, and, trachytes, kenyte, was, first, reported, by, gregory, in, 1900, following, his, study, of, the, geology, of, mount, kenya, the, geology, of, the, mount, kenya, area, was, first, described, scientifically, by, joseph, thomson, in, 1883, he, saw, the, mountain, from, the, nearby, laikipia, plateau, and, wrote, that, it, was, an, extinct, volcano, with, the, plug, exposed, however, as, he, had, only, seen, the, mountain, from, a, distance, his, description, was, not, widely, believed, in, europe, particularly, after, 1887, when, teleki, and, von, h, hnel, ascended, the, mountain, and, described, what, they, considered, to, be, the, crater, in, 1893, gregory, s, expedition, reached, the, lewis, glacier, at, 5, 000, m, 16, 400, ft, he, confirmed, that, the, volcano, was, extinct, and, that, there, were, glaciers, present, the, first, thorough, survey, by, europeans, was, not, undertaken, until, 1966, the, peaks, of, mount, kenya, are, almost, all, of, volcanic, origin, the, majority, of, the, peaks, are, located, near, the, centre, of, the, mountain, which, have, an, alpine, appearance, due, to, their, craggy, nature, typically, of, alpine, terrain, the, highest, peaks, and, gendarmes, occur, at, the, intersection, of, ridges, the, central, peaks, only, have, a, few, mosses, lichens, and, small, alpine, plants, growing, in, rock, crevices, further, away, from, the, central, peaks, the, volcanic, plugs, are, covered, in, volcanic, ash, and, soils, the, vegetation, growing, on, these, peaks, is, typical, for, their, vegetation, band, the, highest, peaks, are, batian, 5, 199, m, or, 17, 057, ft, nelion, 5, 188, m, or, 17, 021, ft, and, pt, lenana, 4, 985, m, or, 16, 355, ft, batian, and, nelion, are, within, 250, m, 270, yd, of, each, other, separated, by, the, gate, of, the, mists, gap, of, 5, 144, m, 16, 877, ft, other, peaks, around, the, central, plug, include, pt, piggot, 4, 957, m, or, 16, 263, ft, pt, dutton, 4, 885, m, or, 16, 027, ft, pt, john, 4, 883, m, or, 16, 020, ft, pt, john, minor, 4, 875, m, or, 15, 994, ft, krapf, rognon, 4, 800, m, or, 15, 748, ft, pt, peter, 4, 757, m, or, 15, 607, ft, pt, slade, 4, 750, m, or, 15, 584, ft, and, midget, peak, 4, 700, m, or, 15, 420, ft, all, of, these, have, a, steep, pyramidal, form, significant, craggy, outlying, peaks, include, terere, 4, 714, m, or, 15, 466, ft, and, sendeyo, 4, 704, m, or, 15, 433, ft, which, form, a, pair, of, twin, peaks, to, the, north, of, the, main, plug, together, they, form, a, large, parasitic, plug, other, notable, peaks, include, the, hat, 4, 639, m, or, 15, 220, ft, delamere, peak, macmillan, peak, and, rotundu, the, glaciers, on, mount, kenya, are, retreating, rapidly, the, mountain, club, of, kenya, in, nairobi, has, photographs, showing, the, mountain, at, the, time, of, the, first, recorded, ascent, in, 1899, and, again, more, recently, the, retreat, of, the, glaciers, is, very, evident, descriptions, of, ascents, of, several, of, the, peaks, advise, the, use, of, crampons, but, this, is, true, only, in, some, cases, and, at, higher, elevations, every, year, there, is, less, new, snow, accumulating, in, winter, than, melting, in, summer, even, on, the, lewis, glacier, the, largest, of, them, in, winter, so, there, is, no, formation, of, new, ice, it, is, predicted, to, be, less, than, 30, years, before, there, will, no, longer, be, ice, on, mount, kenya, glacial, retreat, and, disappearance, can, be, caused, by, changes, in, temperature, trends, or, by, a, change, in, precipitation, trends, the, glacier, names, are, clockwise, from, the, north, the, total, area, covered, by, glaciers, on, the, mountain, was, recorded, as, about, 0, 7, km, 2, 1, 4, sq, mi, in, the, 1980s, far, less, than, that, recorded, by, the, first, observations, made, in, the, 1890s, although, mount, kenya, is, on, the, equator, the, freezing, nightly, temperatures, result, in, periglacial, landforms, there, is, permafrost, a, few, centimetres, inches, below, the, surface, patterned, ground, is, present, at, 3, 400, m, 11, 155, ft, to, the, west, of, mugi, hill, these, mounds, grow, because, the, repeated, freezing, and, thawing, of, the, ground, draws, in, more, water, there, are, blockfields, present, around, 4, 000, m, 13, 123, ft, where, the, ground, has, cracked, to, form, hexagons, solifluction, occurs, when, the, night, temperatures, freeze, the, soil, before, it, thaws, again, in, the, morning, this, daily, expansion, and, contraction, of, the, soil, prevent, the, establishment, of, vegetation, mount, kenya, is, the, main, water, catchment, area, for, two, large, rivers, in, kenya, the, tana, the, largest, river, in, kenya, and, the, ewaso, nyiro, north, the, mount, kenya, ecosystem, provides, water, directly, for, over, 2, million, people, the, rivers, on, mount, kenya, have, been, named, after, the, villages, on, the, slopes, of, the, mountain, that, they, flow, close, to, the, thuchi, river, is, the, district, boundary, between, tharaka, nithi, and, embu, mount, kenya, is, a, major, water, tower, for, the, tana, river, which, in, 1988, supplied, 80, of, kenya, s, electricity, using, a, series, of, seven, hydroelectric, power, stations, and, dams, the, density, of, streams, is, very, high, especially, on, the, lower, slopes, which, have, never, been, glaciated, the, ice, cap, which, used, to, cover, the, mountain, during, the, pliocene, eroded, large, u, shaped, valleys, which, tend, to, only, have, one, large, stream, where, the, original, shape, of, the, shield, volcano, is, still, preserved, there, have, been, millions, of, years, for, streams, to, erode, the, hillside, this, area, is, therefore, characterised, by, frequent, deep, fluvial, v, shaped, valleys, the, gradual, transition, from, glaciated, to, the, fluvial, valley, can, be, clearly, observed, rivers, that, start, on, mount, kenya, are, the, tributaries, of, two, large, kenyan, rivers, the, tana, and, the, ewaso, ng, iro, rivers, a, lot, of, mount, kenyan, rivers, flow, into, the, sagana, which, itself, is, a, tributary, of, the, tana, which, joins, at, the, masinga, reservoir, the, rivers, in, the, northern, part, of, the, mountain, such, as, the, burguret, naru, moru, nanyuki, likii, and, sirimon, flow, into, the, ewaso, nyiro, the, rivers, to, the, southwest, such, as, the, keringa, and, nairobi, flow, into, the, sagana, and, then, into, the, tana, the, remaining, rivers, to, the, south, and, east, such, as, the, kathit, largest, river, in, meru, mutonga, nithi, thuchi, and, nyamindi, flow, directly, into, the, tana, mount, kenya, has, several, altitudinal, ecological, zones, from, the, savanna, surrounding, the, mountain, to, the, nival, zone, by, the, glaciers, each, zone, has, a, dominant, species, of, vegetation, many, of, the, species, found, higher, up, the, mountain, are, endemic, either, to, mount, kenya, or, east, africa, there, are, also, differences, within, the, zones, depending, on, the, side, of, the, mountain, and, the, aspect, of, the, slope, the, southeast, is, much, wetter, than, the, north, so, species, more, dependent, on, moisture, can, grow, some, species, such, as, african, alpine, bamboo, are, limited, to, certain, aspects, of, the, mountain, because, of, the, amount, of, moisture, the, climate, of, mount, kenya, changes, considerably, with, altitude, forming, belts, of, community, types, around, the, base, of, the, mountain, is, fertile, farmland, the, people, living, around, the, mountain, have, cultivated, this, cool, relatively, moist, area, for, centuries, mount, kenya, is, surrounded, by, forests, the, vegetation, in, the, forests, depend, on, rainfall, and, the, species, present, differ, greatly, between, the, northern, and, southern, slopes, as, time, has, passed, the, trees, on, the, edge, of, the, forest, have, been, logged, and, the, farmland, has, encroached, further, up, the, fertile, slopes, of, the, mountain, above, the, forest, is, a, belt, of, african, alpine, bamboo, this, zone, is, almost, continuous, but, is, restricted, to, small, isolated, bunches, in, the, north, because, of, low, rainfall, the, bamboo, is, natural, and, does, not, require, forest, disturbance, tracks, are, common, through, the, bamboo, bamboo, suppresses, other, vegetation, so, it, is, uncommon, to, find, trees, or, other, plants, here, above, the, bamboo, is, the, timberline, forest, the, trees, here, are, often, smaller, than, the, trees, in, the, forests, lower, down, the, mountain, the, forest, here, is, more, intact, because, it, is, less, accessible, and, better, protected, when, the, trees, can, no, longer, grow, the, vegetation, changes, into, heathland, and, chaparral, at, around, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, heathland, is, found, in, the, wetter, areas, on, the, west, side, of, mount, kenya, and, is, dominated, by, giant, heathers, chaparral, is, found, in, drier, areas, and, grasses, are, more, common, and, bushfires, still, occur, as, the, altitude, increases, the, temperature, fluctuations, become, extreme, and, the, air, becomes, thinner, and, drier, this, region, is, known, as, the, afro, alpine, zone, the, environment, here, is, isolated, with, the, only, similar, area, nearby, being, the, aberdares, which, are, 80, km, 50, mi, away, many, of, the, species, here, are, endemic, with, adaptations, to, the, cold, and, fluctuating, temperatures, typical, plants, here, include, giant, groundsels, senecios, and, giant, lobelias, the, region, where, the, glaciers, have, recently, retreated, from, is, nival, zone, it, is, the, area, that, plants, have, not, yet, been, able, to, colonise, the, flora, found, on, mount, kenya, varies, with, altitude, aspect, and, exposure, as, the, altitude, increases, the, plants, have, to, be, more, specialised, with, adaptations, to, strong, sunlight, with, ultraviolet, lower, mean, temperatures, and, freezing, night, temperatures, plants, in, the, afro, alpine, zone, have, overcome, these, difficulties, in, several, ways, one, adaptation, is, known, as, the, giant, rosette, which, is, exhibited, by, giant, senecio, giant, lobelia, and, giant, thistle, carduus, which, use, bud, leaves, to, protect, their, buds, from, freezing, giant, rosette, senecios, form, single, aged, stands, that, drive, community, structure, over, decades, many, plant, species, in, the, afro, alpine, zone, of, mount, kenya, are, giant, versions, of, lowland, or, temperate, relatives, however, nearer, the, nival, zone, the, plants, decrease, in, size, again, the, majority, of, animals, live, lower, down, on, the, slopes, of, mount, kenya, here, there, is, more, vegetation, and, the, climate, is, less, extreme, various, species, of, monkeys, several, antelopes, tree, hyrax, porcupines, and, some, larger, animals, such, as, elephants, and, buffalo, all, live, in, the, forest, predators, found, here, include, hyenas, and, leopards, and, occasionally, lions, there, are, fewer, mammals, found, at, high, altitudes, on, mount, kenya, the, mount, kenya, hyrax, and, common, duiker, can, live, here, and, are, important, to, the, ecosystem, some, smaller, mammals, such, as, the, groove, toothed, rat, can, live, here, by, burrowing, into, the, giant, senecios, and, using, their, thick, stem, of, dead, leaves, as, insulation, the, mount, kenya, mole, rat, tachyoryctes, rex, occurs, at, high, altitudes, living, in, visible, mounds, leopards, are, resident, in, the, alpine, zone, other, mammal, species, are, only, occasional, visitors, remains, of, elephants, monkeys, and, bongo, have, been, found, high, in, the, alpine, zone, and, other, sightings, are, remembered, in, names, such, as, simba, tarn, simba, means, lion, in, swahili, several, bird, species, live, in, the, afro, alpine, zone, including, sunbirds, alpine, chats, and, starlings, and, the, raptors, augur, buzzard, lammergeier, and, verreaux, s, eagle, the, latter, of, which, specializes, in, hunting, hyraxes, birds, are, important, in, this, ecosystem, as, pollinators, the, climate, of, mount, kenya, has, played, a, critical, role, in, the, development, of, the, mountain, influencing, the, topography, and, ecology, amongst, other, factors, it, has, a, typical, equatorial, mountain, climate, which, hedberg, described, as, winter, every, night, and, summer, every, day, mount, kenya, is, home, to, one, of, the, global, atmosphere, watch, s, atmospheric, monitoring, stations, the, year, is, divided, into, two, distinct, wet, seasons, and, two, distinct, dry, seasons, which, mirror, the, wet, and, dry, seasons, in, the, kenyan, lowlands, as, mount, kenya, ranges, in, height, from, 1, 374, to, 5, 199, m, 4, 508, to, 17, 057, ft, the, climate, varies, considerably, over, the, mountain, and, has, different, zones, of, influence, the, lower, southeastern, slopes, are, the, wettest, as, the, predominant, weather, system, comes, from, the, indian, ocean, this, rainfall, supports, dense, montane, forests, on, these, slopes, high, on, the, mountain, most, of, the, precipitation, falls, as, snow, combined, these, water, sources, feed, 11, glaciers, the, current, climate, on, mount, kenya, is, wet, but, drier, than, it, has, been, in, the, past, the, temperatures, span, a, wide, range, which, diminishes, with, altitude, in, the, lower, alpine, zone, temperature, usually, do, not, go, below, 12, c, 54, f, snow, and, rain, are, common, from, march, to, december, but, especially, in, the, two, wet, seasons, the, wet, seasons, combined, account, for, 5, 6, or, 83, of, the, annual, precipitation, the, monsoon, which, controls, the, wet, and, dry, seasons, means, that, for, most, of, the, year, there, are, south, easterly, winds, but, during, january, and, february, the, dominant, wind, direction, is, north, easterly, mount, kenya, like, most, locations, in, the, tropics, has, two, wet, seasons, and, two, dry, seasons, as, a, result, of, the, monsoon, from, mid, march, to, june, the, heavy, rain, season, known, as, the, long, rains, brings, approximately, half, of, the, annual, rainfall, on, the, mountain, this, is, followed, by, the, wetter, of, the, two, dry, seasons, which, lasts, until, september, october, to, december, are, the, short, rains, when, the, mountain, receives, approximately, a, third, of, its, rainfall, total, finally, from, december, to, mid, march, is, the, drier, dry, season, when, the, mountain, experiences, the, least, rain, during, the, dry, season, the, mountain, almost, always, follows, the, same, daily, weather, pattern, large, daily, temperature, fluctuations, occur, which, led, hedberg, to, exclaim, winter, every, night, and, summer, every, day, there, is, variation, in, minimum, and, maximum, temperatures, day, to, day, but, the, standard, deviation, of, the, mean, hourly, pattern, is, small, a, typical, day, is, clear, and, cool, in, the, morning, with, low, humidity, the, mountain, is, in, direct, sunlight, which, causes, the, temperatures, to, rise, quickly, with, the, warmest, temperatures, occurring, between, 09, 00, and, 12, 00, this, corresponds, to, a, maximum, in, the, pressure, usually, around, 10, 00, low, on, the, mountain, between, 2, 400, and, 3, 900, m, 7, 874, and, 12, 795, ft, clouds, begin, to, form, over, the, western, forest, zone, due, to, moist, air, from, lake, victoria, the, anabatic, winds, caused, by, warm, rising, air, gradually, bring, these, clouds, to, the, summit, region, in, the, afternoon, around, 15, 00, there, is, a, minimum, in, sunlight, and, a, maximum, in, humidity, causing, the, actual, and, perceived, temperature, to, drop, at, 16, 00, there, is, a, minimum, of, pressure, this, daily, cover, of, clouds, protects, the, glaciers, on, the, southwest, of, the, mountain, which, would, otherwise, get, direct, sun, every, day, enhancing, their, melt, the, upwelling, cloud, eventually, reaches, the, dry, easterly, air, streams, and, dissipates, leading, to, a, clear, sky, by, 17, 00, there, is, another, maximum, temperature, associated, with, this, being, an, equatorial, mountain, the, daylight, hours, are, constant, with, twelve, hour, days, sunrise, is, about, 06, 30, with, the, sun, setting, at, 18, 30, both, eat, utc, 3, over, the, year, there, is, a, one, minute, difference, between, the, shortest, and, longest, days, at, night, the, sky, is, usually, clear, with, katabatic, winds, blowing, down, the, valleys, above, the, lower, alpine, zone, there, is, usually, frost, every, night, the, first, european, to, report, seeing, mount, kenya, was, dr, johann, ludwig, krapf, a, german, missionary, from, kitui, a, town, 150, km, 90, mi, away, from, the, mountain, the, sighting, was, made, on, 3, december, 1849, a, year, after, the, first, sighting, of, mount, kilimanjaro, by, a, european, krapf, was, told, by, the, embu, people, that, lived, around, the, mountain, that, they, did, not, ascend, high, enough, on, the, mountain, because, of, the, intense, cold, and, the, white, matter, that, rolled, down, the, mountains, with, a, loud, noise, this, led, him, to, infer, that, glaciers, existed, on, the, mountain, it, was, krapf, who, gave, the, mountain, the, name, kenya, but, the, derivation, of, this, is, not, known, with, certainty, krapf, also, noted, that, the, rivers, flowing, from, mount, kenya, and, other, mountains, in, the, area, were, continuously, flowing, this, was, very, different, from, the, other, rivers, in, the, area, which, swelled, up, in, the, wet, season, and, completely, dried, up, after, the, rainy, season, had, ended, as, the, streams, flowed, even, in, the, driest, seasons, he, concluded, that, there, must, be, a, source, of, water, up, on, the, mountain, in, the, form, of, glaciers, he, believed, the, mountain, to, be, the, source, of, the, white, nile, in, 1851, krapf, returned, to, kitui, he, travelled, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, closer, to, the, mountain, but, did, not, see, it, again, in, 1877, hildebrandt, was, in, the, kitui, area, and, heard, stories, about, the, mountain, but, also, did, not, see, it, since, there, were, no, confirmations, to, back, up, krapf, s, claim, people, began, to, be, suspicious, in, 1883, joseph, thomson, passed, close, by, the, west, side, of, the, mountain, and, confirmed, krapf, s, claim, he, diverted, his, expedition, and, reached, 1, 737, m, 5, 700, ft, up, the, slopes, of, the, mountain, but, had, to, retreat, because, of, trouble, with, local, people, the, first, european, exploration, high, onto, the, mountain, was, achieved, in, 1887, by, count, s, muel, teleki, he, managed, to, reach, 4, 350, m, 14, 270, ft, on, the, southwestern, slopes, on, this, expedition, teleki, mistakenly, believed, he, had, found, the, crater, of, a, volcano, in, 1892, teleki, and, von, h, hnel, returned, to, the, eastern, side, but, were, unable, to, get, through, the, forest, in, 1893, an, expedition, managed, to, ascend, mount, kenya, as, far, as, the, glaciers, this, expedition, was, traveling, from, the, coast, to, lake, baringo, in, the, rift, valley, and, was, led, by, dr, john, w, gregory, a, british, geologist, they, managed, to, ascend, the, mountain, to, around, 4, 730, m, 15, 520, ft, and, spent, several, hours, on, the, lewis, glacier, with, their, guide, on, his, return, to, britain, gregory, published, papers, and, a, narrative, account, of, his, achievements, george, kolb, a, german, physician, made, expeditions, in, 1894, and, 1896, and, was, the, first, to, reach, the, moorlands, on, the, east, side, of, the, mountain, more, exploration, occurred, after, 1899, when, the, uganda, railway, was, completed, as, far, as, the, future, site, of, nairobi, on, 28, july, 1899, sir, halford, john, mackinder, set, out, from, the, site, of, nairobi, on, an, expedition, to, mount, kenya, the, members, of, the, expedition, consisted, of, 6, europeans, 66, swahilis, 2, maasai, guides, and, 96, kikuyu, the, europeans, were, campbell, b, hausberg, second, in, command, and, photographer, douglas, saunders, botanist, c, f, camburn, taxidermist, cesar, ollier, guide, and, josef, brocherel, guide, and, porter, the, expedition, made, it, as, far, as, the, mountain, but, encountered, many, difficulties, on, the, way, the, country, they, passed, through, was, full, of, plague, and, famine, many, kikuyu, porters, tried, to, desert, with, women, from, the, villages, and, others, stole, from, the, villages, which, made, the, chiefs, very, hostile, towards, the, expedition, when, they, reached, the, base, camp, on, 18, august, they, could, not, find, any, food, suffered, two, of, their, party, killed, by, the, local, people, and, eventually, had, to, send, saunders, to, naivasha, to, get, help, from, captain, gorges, the, government, officer, there, mackinder, pushed, on, up, the, mountain, and, established, a, camp, at, 3, 142, m, 10, 310, ft, in, the, h, hnel, valley, he, made, his, first, attempt, on, the, summit, on, 30, august, with, ollier, and, brocherel, up, the, southeast, face, but, they, had, to, retreat, when, they, were, within, 100, m, 330, ft, of, the, summit, of, nelion, due, to, nightfall, on, 5, september, hausberg, ollier, and, brocherel, made, a, circuit, of, the, main, peaks, looking, for, an, easier, route, to, the, summit, they, could, not, find, one, on, 11, september, ollier, and, brocherel, made, an, ascent, of, the, darwin, glacier, but, were, forced, to, retreat, due, to, a, blizzard, when, saunders, returned, from, naivasha, with, the, relief, party, mackinder, had, another, attempt, at, the, summit, with, ollier, and, brocherel, they, traversed, the, lewis, glacier, and, climbed, the, southeast, face, of, nelion, they, spent, the, night, near, the, gendarme, and, traversed, the, snowfield, at, the, head, of, the, darwin, glacier, at, dawn, before, cutting, steps, up, the, diamond, glacier, they, reached, the, summit, of, batian, at, noon, on, 13, september, 1899, and, descended, by, the, same, route, during, the, expedition, mackinder, ordered, for, 8, of, the, 90, african, porters, who, he, had, bought, from, a, slave, owner, to, carry, his, supplies, to, be, shot, after, the, first, ascent, of, mount, kenya, there, were, fewer, expeditions, there, for, a, while, the, majority, of, the, exploration, until, after, the, first, world, war, was, by, settlers, in, kenya, who, were, not, on, scientific, expeditions, a, church, of, scotland, mission, was, set, up, in, chogoria, and, several, scottish, missionaries, ascended, to, the, peaks, including, rev, dr, j, w, arthur, g, dennis, and, a, r, barlow, there, were, other, ascents, but, none, succeeded, in, summitting, batian, or, nelion, new, approach, routes, were, cleared, through, the, forest, which, made, access, to, the, area, of, the, peak, far, easier, in, 1920, arthur, and, sir, fowell, buxton, tried, to, cut, a, route, in, from, the, south, and, other, routes, came, in, from, nanyuki, in, the, north, but, the, most, commonly, used, was, the, route, from, the, chogoria, mission, in, the, east, built, by, ernest, carr, carr, is, also, credited, with, building, urumandi, and, top, huts, on, 6, january, 1929, the, first, ascent, of, nelion, was, made, by, percy, wyn, harris, and, eric, shipton, they, climbed, the, normal, route, then, descended, to, the, gate, of, mists, before, ascending, batian, on, 8, january, they, reascended, this, time, with, g, a, sommerfelt, and, in, december, shipton, made, another, ascent, with, r, e, g, russell, they, also, made, the, first, ascent, of, point, john, during, this, year, the, mountain, club, of, east, africa, was, formed, at, the, end, of, july, 1930, shipton, and, bill, tilman, made, the, first, traverse, of, the, peaks, they, ascended, by, the, west, ridge, of, batian, traversed, the, gate, of, mists, to, nelion, and, descended, the, normal, route, during, this, trip, shipton, and, tilman, made, the, first, ascents, of, several, other, peaks, including, point, peter, point, dutton, midget, peak, point, pigott, and, either, terere, or, sendeyo, in, the, early, 1930s, there, were, several, visits, to, the, moorlands, around, mount, kenya, with, fewer, as, far, as, the, peaks, raymond, hook, and, humphrey, slade, ascended, to, map, the, mountain, and, stocked, several, of, the, streams, with, trout, by, 1938, there, had, been, several, more, ascents, of, nelion, in, february, miss, c, carroll, and, mtu, muthara, became, the, first, woman, and, african, respectively, to, ascend, nelion, in, an, expedition, with, noel, symington, author, of, the, night, climbers, of, cambridge, and, on, 5, march, miss, una, cameron, became, the, first, woman, to, ascend, batian, during, the, second, world, war, there, was, another, drop, in, the, ascents, of, the, mountain, the, most, remarkable, ascent, during, this, period, was, by, three, italians, who, were, being, held, in, a, british, pow, camp, at, the, base, of, the, mountain, in, nanyuki, they, escaped, from, camp, to, climb, the, mountain, s, third, peak, point, lenana, before, escaping, back, into, camp, felice, benuzzi, the, team, leader, retold, his, story, in, the, book, no, picnic, on, mount, kenya, 1946, in, 1949, the, mountain, club, of, kenya, split, from, the, mountain, club, of, east, africa, and, the, area, above, 3, 400, m, 11, 150, ft, was, designated, a, national, park, a, road, was, built, from, naro, moru, to, the, moorlands, allowing, easier, access, many, new, routes, were, climbed, on, batian, and, nelion, in, the, next, three, decades, and, in, october, 1959, the, mountain, club, of, kenya, produced, their, first, guide, to, mount, kenya, and, kilimanjaro, on, kenyan, independence, in, 1963, kisoi, munyao, raised, the, kenyan, flag, at, the, top, of, the, mountain, he, died, in, 2007, and, was, given, a, heroic, funeral, attended, by, the, kenyan, president, mwai, kibaki, in, the, early, 1970s, the, mount, kenya, national, park, mountain, rescue, team, was, formed, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, all, major, routes, on, the, peaks, had, been, climbed, on, 19, july, 2003, a, south, african, registered, aircraft, carrying, 12, passengers, and, two, crew, crashed, into, mount, kenya, at, point, lenana, nobody, survived, this, was, not, the, first, aircraft, lost, on, the, mountain, there, is, also, the, wreckage, of, at, least, one, helicopter, that, crashed, before, 1972, in, march, 2012, a, massive, fire, raged, on, mount, kenya, devouring, thousands, of, hectares, of, ancient, forests, and, endangered, wildlife, most, of, the, peaks, on, mount, kenya, have, been, summited, the, majority, of, these, involve, rock, climbing, as, the, easiest, route, although, some, only, require, a, scramble, or, a, walk, the, highest, peak, that, can, be, ascended, without, climbing, is, point, lenana, 4, 985, m, 16, 355, ft, the, majority, of, the, 15, 000, visitors, to, the, national, park, each, year, climb, this, peak, in, contrast, approximately, 200, people, summit, nelion, and, 50, summit, batian, the, two, highest, peaks, when, ascended, directly, batian, is, usually, climbed, via, the, north, face, standard, route, uiaa, grade, iv, or, 5, 6, yds, the, first, recorded, ascent, of, batian, was, on, 13, september, 1899, by, sir, halford, john, mackinder, cesar, ollier, and, josef, brocherel, the, normal, route, is, the, most, climbed, route, up, nelion, and, thence, across, to, batian, it, was, first, climbed, by, eric, shipton, and, percy, wyn, harris, on, 6, january, 1929, it, is, possible, to, traverse, between, the, two, peaks, via, the, gates, of, mist, but, this, often, involves, spending, a, night, in, the, howell, hut, on, top, of, nelion, there, is, a, bolted, abseil, descent, route, off, nelion, mount, kenya, s, climbing, seasons, are, a, result, of, its, location, only, 20, km, 12, mi, from, the, equator, during, the, northern, summer, the, rock, routes, on, the, north, side, of, the, peak, are, in, good, summer, condition, while, at, the, same, time, the, ice, routes, on, the, south, side, of, the, peak, are, in, prime, shape, the, situation, is, reversed, during, the, southern, summer, the, two, seasons, are, separated, by, several, months, of, the, rainy, season, before, and, after, during, which, climbing, conditions, are, generally, unfavorable, mount, kenya, is, home, to, several, good, ice, routes, the, two, most, famous, being, the, diamond, couloir, and, the, ice, window, route, snow, and, ice, levels, on, the, mountain, have, been, retreating, at, an, accelerated, rate, in, recent, years, making, these, climbs, increasingly, difficult, and, dangerous, the, diamond, couloir, a, steep, ice, couloir, fed, by, the, fusion, of, the, upper, diamond, glacier, was, first, climbed, by, national, park, staff, phil, snyder, and, thumbi, mathenge, in, october, 1973, a, direct, finish, was, pioneered, in, 1975, by, yvon, chouinard, and, michael, covington, the, couloir, was, once, climbable, in, summer, or, winter, but, now, is, virtually, unclimbable, in, summer, conditions, and, is, seldom, deemed, in, climbable, condition, even, in, winter, last, climbing, reports, describe, the, route, very, difficult, especially, in, the, lower, section, the, route, has, changed, into, a, modern, ice, climb, with, a, very, difficult, 60m, first, pitch, starting, with, 8m, of, overhanging, m7, dry, tooling, followed, by, 50m, of, usa, grade, v, ice, and, by, 6, pitches, of, moderate, climbing, on, good, ice, and, finally, one, pitch, of, water, ice, usa, grade, iv, ice, at, the, headwall, before, getting, to, the, upper, diamond, glacier, the, satellite, peaks, around, the, mountain, also, provide, good, climbs, these, can, be, climbed, in, alpine, style, and, vary, in, difficulty, from, a, scramble, to, climbing, at, uiaa, grade, vi, they, are, useful, for, acclimatisation, before, climbing, the, higher, peaks, and, as, ascents, in, their, own, right, there, are, eight, walking, routes, up, to, the, main, peaks, starting, clockwise, from, the, north, these, are, the, meru, chogoria, kamweti, naro, moru, burguret, sirimon, and, timau, routes, of, these, chogoria, naro, moru, and, sirimon, are, used, most, frequently, and, therefore, have, staffed, gates, the, other, routes, require, special, permission, from, the, kenya, wildlife, service, to, use, the, chogoria, route, leads, from, chogoria, town, up, to, the, peaks, circuit, path, it, heads, through, the, forest, to, the, south, east, of, the, mountain, to, the, moorland, with, views, over, areas, such, as, ithanguni, and, the, giant, s, billiards, table, before, following, the, gorges, valley, past, the, temple, and, up, to, simba, col, below, point, lenana, the, mountain, club, of, kenya, claims, that, ithanguni, and, the, giant, s, billiards, table, offer, some, of, the, best, hillwalking, in, kenya, the, naro, moru, route, is, taken, by, many, of, the, trekkers, who, try, to, reach, point, lenana, it, can, be, ascended, in, only, 3, days, and, has, bunkhouses, at, each, camp, the, route, starts, at, naro, moru, town, to, the, west, of, the, mountain, and, climbs, towards, mackinder, s, camp, before, joining, the, peak, circuit, path, the, terrain, is, usually, good, although, one, section, is, called, the, vertical, bog, the, sirimon, route, approaches, mount, kenya, from, the, northwest, the, path, splits, on, the, moorlands, with, the, more, frequently, used, fork, following, the, mackinder, valley, and, the, quieter, route, traversing, into, the, liki, north, valley, the, paths, rejoin, at, shipton, s, cave, just, below, shipton, s, camp, on, the, peak, circuit, path, the, peak, circuit, path, is, a, path, around, the, main, peaks, with, a, distance, of, about, 10, km, 6, mi, and, height, gain, and, loss, of, over, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, it, can, be, walked, in, one, day, but, more, commonly, takes, two, or, three, it, can, also, be, used, to, join, different, ascent, and, descent, routes, the, route, does, not, require, technical, climbing, development, is, currently, underway, for, a, new, route, up, the, mountain, starting, from, the, ragati, conservancy, and, running, up, the, ridge, between, the, naro, moru, route, and, the, old, kamweti, trail, the, origin, of, the, name, kenya, is, not, clear, but, perhaps, linked, to, the, kikuyu, embu, and, kamba, words, kirinyaga, kirenyaa, and, kiinyaa, which, mean, god, s, resting, place, in, all, three, languages, in, the, 19th, century, the, german, explorer, ludwig, krapf, recorded, the, name, as, both, kenia, and, kegnia, believed, by, some, to, be, a, corruption, of, the, kamba, version, others, however, say, that, this, was, on, the, contrary, a, very, precise, notation, of, the, correct, african, pronunciation, k, n, j, wangari, maathai, tells, the, following, story, about, the, naming, krapf, and, johannes, rebmann, asked, their, guide, a, member, of, the, kamba, community, who, was, carrying, a, gourd, what, they, called, the, mountain, and, the, guide, believing, that, the, germans, were, referring, to, the, gourd, replied, k, nyaa, which, became, the, name, of, the, mountain, and, then, the, country, in, any, case, the, name, was, for, a, long, time, pronounced, by, colonial, heritage, europeans, as, k, i, n, j, the, european, pronunciation, has, been, abandoned, in, modern, times, in, favor, of, the, african, version, the, peaks, of, mount, kenya, have, been, given, names, from, three, different, sources, firstly, several, maasai, chieftains, have, been, commemorated, with, names, such, as, batian, nelion, and, lenana, they, commemorate, mbatian, a, maasai, laibon, medicine, man, nelieng, his, brother, and, lenana, and, sendeyo, his, sons, terere, is, named, after, another, maasai, headman, the, second, type, of, name, that, was, given, to, peaks, is, after, european, climbers, and, explorers, some, examples, of, this, are, shipton, sommerfelt, tilman, dutton, and, arthur, the, remaining, names, are, after, well, known, kenyan, personalities, except, john, and, peter, which, were, named, by, the, missionary, arthur, after, two, disciples, there, is, a, group, of, four, peaks, to, the, east, of, the, main, peaks, named, after, european, settlers, coryndon, grigg, delamere, and, mcmillan
