vast, markets, of, the, new, british, empire, and, glasgow, became, prominent, as, a, hub, of, international, trade, to, and, from, the, americas, especially, in, sugar, tobacco, cotton, and, manufactured, goods, starting, in, 1668, the, city, s, tobacco, lords, created, a, deep, water, port, at, port, glasgow, about, 20, mi, 32, km, down, the, river, clyde, as, the, river, from, the, city, to, that, point, was, then, too, shallow, for, seagoing, merchant, ships, by, the, late, 18th, century, more, than, half, of, the, british, tobacco, trade, was, concentrated, on, the, river,

trade, of, sugar, tobacco, and, later, cotton, from, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, city, began, expanding, westwards, from, its, medieval, core, at, glasgow, cross, with, a, grid, iron, street, plan, starting, from, the, 1770s, and, eventually, reaching, george, square, to, accommodate, much, of, the, growth, with, that, expansion, much, later, becoming, known, in, the, 1980s, onwards, as, the, merchant, city, the, largest, growth, in, the, city, centre, area, building, on, the, wealth, of, trading, internationally, was, the, next, expansion, being, the, grid, iron, streets, west, of,

1795, facilitated, access, to, the, extensive, iron, ore, and, coal, mines, in, lanarkshire, after, extensive, river, engineering, projects, to, dredge, and, deepen, the, river, clyde, as, far, as, glasgow, shipbuilding, became, a, major, industry, on, the, upper, stretches, of, the, river, pioneered, by, industrialists, such, as, robert, napier, john, elder, george, thomson, sir, william, pearce, and, sir, alfred, yarrow, the, river, clyde, also, became, an, important, source, of, inspiration, for, artists, such, as, john, atkinson, grimshaw, john, knox, james, kay, sir, muirhead, bone, robert, eadie, and, l, s, lowry, willing, to, depict, the, new, industrial, era, and, the, modern, world, as, did, stanley, spencer, downriver, at, port, glasgow, with, the, population, growing, the, first, scheme, to, provide, a, public, water, supply, was, by, the, glasgow, company, in, 1806, a, second, company, was, formed, in, 1812, and, the, two, merged, in, 1838, but, there, was, some, dissatisfaction, with, the, quality, of, the, water, supplied, the, gorbals, gravitation, water, company, began, supplying, water, to, residents, living, to, the, south, of, the, river, clyde, in, 1846, obtained, from, reservoirs, which, gave, 75, 000, people, a, constant, water, supply, but, others, were, not, so, fortunate, and, some, 4, 000, died, in, an, outbreak, of, cholera, in, 1848, 1849, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, glasgow, corporation, water, works, with, a, project, to, raise, the, level, of, loch, katrine, and, to, convey, clean, water, by, gravity, along, a, 26, mi, 42, km, aqueduct, to, a, holding, reservoir, at, milngavie, and, then, by, pipes, into, the, city, the, project, cost, 980, 000, and, was, opened, by, queen, victoria, in, 1859, in, the, early, 19th, century, an, eighth, of, the, people, lived, in, single, room, accommodation, the, engineer, for, the, project, was, john, frederick, bateman, while, james, morris, gale, became, the, resident, engineer, for, the, city, section, of, the, project, and, subsequently, became, engineer, in, chief, for, glasgow, water, commissioners, he, oversaw, several, improvements, during, his, tenure, including, a, second, aqueduct, and, further, raising, of, water, levels, in, loch, katrine, additional, supplies, were, provided, by, loch, arklet, in, 1902, by, impounding, the, water, and, creating, a, tunnel, to, allow, water, to, flow, into, loch, katrine, a, similar, scheme, to, create, a, reservoir, in, glen, finglas, was, authorised, in, 1903, but, was, deferred, and, was, not, completed, until, 1965, following, the, 2002, glasgow, floods, the, waterborne, parasite, cryptosporidium, was, found, in, the, reservoir, at, milngavie, and, so, the, new, milngavie, water, treatment, works, was, built, it, was, opened, by, queen, elizabeth, in, 2007, and, won, the, 2007, utility, industry, achievement, award, having, been, completed, ahead, of, its, time, schedule, and, for, 10, million, below, its, budgeted, cost, good, health, requires, both, clean, water, and, effective, removal, of, sewage, the, caledonian, railway, rebuilt, many, of, the, sewers, as, part, of, a, deal, to, allow, them, to, tunnel, under, the, city, and, sewage, treatment, works, were, opened, at, dalmarnoch, in, 1894, dalmuir, in, 1904, and, shieldhall, in, 1910, the, works, experimented, to, find, better, ways, to, treat, sewage, and, a, number, of, experimental, filters, were, constructed, until, a, full, activated, sludge, plant, was, built, between, 1962, and, 1968, at, a, cost, of, 4, million, treated, sludge, was, dumped, at, sea, and, glasgow, corporation, owned, six, sludge, ships, between, 1904, and, 1998, when, the, eu, urban, waste, water, treatment, directive, ended, the, practice, the, sewerage, infrastructure, was, improved, significantly, in, 2017, with, the, completion, of, a, tunnel, 3, 1, mi, 5, 0, km, long, which, provides, 20, 10, 6, imp, gal, 90, ml, of, storm, water, storage, it, will, reduce, the, risk, of, flooding, and, the, likelihood, that, sewage, will, overflow, into, the, clyde, during, storms, since, 2002, clean, water, provision, and, sewerage, have, been, the, responsibility, of, scottish, water, glasgow, s, population, had, surpassed, that, of, edinburgh, by, 1821, the, development, of, civic, institutions, included, the, city, of, glasgow, police, in, 1800, one, of, the, first, municipal, police, forces, in, the, world, despite, the, crisis, caused, by, the, city, of, glasgow, bank, s, collapse, in, 1878, growth, continued, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, one, of, the, cities, known, as, the, second, city, of, the, empire, and, was, producing, more, than, half, britain, s, tonnage, of, shipping, and, a, quarter, of, all, locomotives, in, the, world, in, addition, to, its, pre, eminence, in, shipbuilding, engineering, industrial, machinery, bridge, building, chemicals, explosives, coal, and, oil, industries, it, developed, as, a, major, centre, in, textiles, garment, making, carpet, manufacturing, leather, processing, furniture, making, pottery, food, drink, and, cigarette, making, printing, and, publishing, shipping, banking, insurance, and, professional, services, expanded, at, the, same, time, glasgow, became, one, of, the, first, cities, in, europe, to, reach, a, population, of, one, million, the, city, s, new, trades, and, sciences, attracted, new, residents, from, across, the, lowlands, and, the, highlands, of, scotland, from, ireland, and, other, parts, of, britain, and, from, continental, europe, during, this, period, the, construction, of, many, of, the, city, s, greatest, architectural, masterpieces, and, most, ambitious, civil, engineering, projects, such, as, the, milngavie, water, treatment, works, glasgow, subway, glasgow, corporation, tramways, city, chambers, mitchell, library, and, kelvingrove, art, gallery, and, museum, were, being, funded, by, its, wealth, the, city, also, held, a, series, of, international, exhibitions, at, kelvingrove, park, in, 1888, 1901, and, 1911, with, britain, s, last, major, international, exhibition, the, empire, exhibition, being, subsequently, held, in, 1938, at, bellahouston, park, which, drew, 13, million, visitors, the, 20th, century, witnessed, both, decline, and, renewal, in, the, city, after, world, war, i, the, city, suffered, from, the, impact, of, the, post, world, war, i, recession, and, from, the, later, great, depression, this, also, led, to, a, rise, of, radical, socialism, and, the, red, clydeside, movement, the, city, had, recovered, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, the, city, saw, aerial, bombardment, by, the, luftwaffe, during, the, clydebank, blitz, during, the, war, then, grew, through, the, post, war, boom, that, lasted, through, the, 1950s, by, the, 1960s, growth, of, industry, in, countries, like, japan, and, west, germany, weakened, the, once, pre, eminent, position, of, many, of, the, city, s, industries, as, a, result, of, this, glasgow, entered, a, lengthy, period, of, relative, economic, decline, and, rapid, de, industrialisation, leading, to, high, unemployment, urban, decay, population, decline, welfare, dependency, and, poor, health, for, the, city, s, inhabitants, there, were, active, attempts, at, regeneration, of, the, city, when, the, glasgow, corporation, published, its, controversial, bruce, report, which, set, out, a, comprehensive, series, of, initiatives, aimed, at, turning, round, the, decline, of, the, city, the, report, led, to, a, huge, and, radical, programme, of, rebuilding, and, regeneration, efforts, that, started, in, the, mid, 1950s, and, lasted, into, the, late, 1970s, this, involved, the, mass, demolition, of, the, city, s, infamous, slums, and, their, replacement, with, large, suburban, housing, estates, and, tower, blocks, the, city, invested, heavily, in, roads, infrastructure, with, an, extensive, system, of, arterial, roads, and, motorways, that, bisected, the, central, area, there, are, also, accusations, that, the, scottish, office, had, deliberately, attempted, to, undermine, glasgow, s, economic, and, political, influence, in, post, war, scotland, by, diverting, inward, investment, in, new, industries, to, other, regions, during, the, silicon, glen, boom, and, creating, the, new, towns, of, cumbernauld, glenrothes, irvine, livingston, and, east, kilbride, dispersed, across, the, scottish, lowlands, to, halve, the, city, s, population, base, by, the, late, 1980s, there, had, been, a, significant, resurgence, in, glasgow, s, economic, fortunes, the, glasgow, s, miles, better, campaign, launched, in, 1983, and, opening, of, the, burrell, collection, in, 1983, and, scottish, exhibition, and, conference, centre, in, 1985, facilitated, glasgow, s, new, role, as, a, european, centre, for, business, services, and, finance, and, promoted, an, increase, in, tourism, and, inward, investment, the, latter, continues, to, be, bolstered, by, the, legacy, of, the, city, s, glasgow, garden, festival, in, 1988, its, status, as, european, capital, of, culture, in, 1990, and, concerted, attempts, to, diversify, the, city, s, economy, however, it, is, the, industrial, heritage, that, serves, as, key, tourism, enabler, wider, economic, revival, has, persisted, and, the, ongoing, regeneration, of, inner, city, areas, including, the, large, scale, clyde, waterfront, regeneration, has, led, to, more, affluent, people, moving, back, to, live, in, the, centre, of,
