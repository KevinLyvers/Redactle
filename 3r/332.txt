the, grand, canyon, is, a, steep, sided, canyon, carved, by, the, colorado, river, in, arizona, united, states, the, grand, canyon, is, 277, miles, 446, km, long, up, to, 18, miles, 29, km, wide, and, attains, a, depth, of, over, a, mile, 6, 093, feet, or, 1, 857, meters, 902, the, canyon, and, adjacent, rim, are, contained, within, grand, canyon, national, park, the, kaibab, national, forest, grand, canyon, parashant, national, monument, the, hualapai, indian, reservation, the, havasupai, indian, reservation, and, the, navajo, nation, the, surrounding, area, is, contained, within, the, baaj, nwaavjo, i, tah, kukveni, ancestral, footprints, of, the, grand, canyon, national, monument, president, theodore, roosevelt, was, a, major, proponent, of, the, preservation, of, the, grand, canyon, area, and, visited, it, on, numerous, occasions, to, hunt, and, enjoy, the, scenery, nearly, two, billion, years, of, earth, s, geological, history, have, been, exposed, as, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, cut, their, channels, through, layer, after, layer, of, rock, while, the, colorado, plateau, was, uplifted, while, some, aspects, about, the, history, of, incision, of, the, canyon, are, debated, by, geologists, several, recent, studies, support, the, hypothesis, that, the, colorado, river, established, its, course, through, the, area, about, 5, to, 6, million, years, ago, since, that, time, the, colorado, river, has, driven, the, down, cutting, of, the, tributaries, and, retreat, of, the, cliffs, simultaneously, deepening, and, widening, the, canyon, for, thousands, of, years, the, area, has, been, continuously, inhabited, by, native, americans, who, built, settlements, within, the, canyon, and, its, many, caves, the, pueblo, people, considered, the, grand, canyon, a, holy, site, and, made, pilgrimages, to, it, the, first, european, known, to, have, viewed, the, grand, canyon, was, garc, a, l, pez, de, c, rdenas, from, spain, who, arrived, in, 1540, the, grand, canyon, is, a, river, valley, in, the, colorado, plateau, that, exposes, uplifted, proterozoic, and, paleozoic, strata, and, it, is, also, one, of, the, six, distinct, physiographic, sections, of, the, colorado, plateau, province, even, though, it, is, not, the, deepest, canyon, in, the, world, kali, gandaki, gorge, in, nepal, is, much, deeper, the, grand, canyon, is, known, for, its, visually, overwhelming, size, and, its, intricate, and, colorful, landscape, geologically, it, is, significant, because, of, the, thick, sequence, of, ancient, rocks, that, are, well, preserved, and, exposed, in, the, walls, of, the, canyon, these, rock, layers, record, much, of, the, early, geologic, history, of, the, north, american, continent, uplift, associated, with, mountain, formation, later, moved, these, sediments, thousands, of, feet, upward, and, created, the, colorado, plateau, the, higher, elevation, has, also, resulted, in, greater, precipitation, in, the, colorado, river, drainage, area, but, not, enough, to, change, the, grand, canyon, area, from, being, semi, arid, the, uplift, of, the, colorado, plateau, is, uneven, and, the, kaibab, plateau, that, the, grand, canyon, bisects, is, over, one, thousand, feet, 300, m, higher, at, the, north, rim, than, at, the, south, rim, almost, all, runoff, from, the, north, rim, which, also, gets, more, rain, and, snow, flows, toward, the, grand, canyon, while, much, of, the, runoff, on, the, plateau, behind, the, south, rim, flows, away, from, the, canyon, following, the, general, tilt, the, result, is, deeper, and, longer, tributary, washes, and, canyons, on, the, north, side, and, shorter, and, steeper, side, canyons, on, the, south, side, 406, temperatures, on, the, north, rim, are, generally, lower, than, those, on, the, south, rim, because, of, the, greater, elevation, averaging, 8, 000, feet, or, 2, 400, meters, above, sea, level, heavy, rains, are, common, on, both, rims, during, the, summer, months, access, to, the, north, rim, via, the, primary, route, leading, to, the, canyon, state, route, 67, is, limited, during, the, winter, season, due, to, road, closures, the, grand, canyon, is, part, of, the, colorado, river, basin, which, has, developed, over, the, past, 70, million, years, for, more, than, 150, years, scientists, have, gathered, data, proposed, new, ideas, and, debated, sometimes, contentious, theories, about, the, geologic, origins, of, the, grand, canyon, and, the, colorado, river, formation, of, the, grand, canyon, and, the, colorado, river, may, involve, a, complex, history, in, which, multiple, factors, and, geologic, processes, have, interacted, over, time, and, in, different, locations, in, the, most, recent, round, of, old, river, vs, young, river, controversy, researchers, have, challenged, estimates, that, had, placed, the, age, of, the, canyon, at, 5, 6, million, years, the, research, has, aroused, considerable, controversy, because, it, suggests, a, substantial, departure, from, prior, widely, supported, scientific, consensus, in, a, 2008, study, victor, polyak, examined, caves, near, the, grand, canyon, and, placed, their, origins, about, 17, million, years, ago, the, study, which, was, published, in, the, journal, science, in, 2008, used, uranium, lead, dating, to, analyze, calcite, deposits, found, on, the, walls, of, nine, caves, throughout, the, canyon, in, another, 2008, study, rebecca, flowers, reported, on, apatite, u, th, he, thermochronometry, results, suggesting, that, parts, of, the, grand, canyon, had, reached, a, depth, near, to, the, modern, depth, around, 20, million, years, ago, in, a, subsequent, study, published, in, the, journal, science, in, 2012, she, suggested, that, the, western, part, of, the, grand, canyon, could, be, as, old, as, 70, million, years, the, emerging, scientific, consensus, is, that, the, canyon, is, made, up, of, multiple, segments, which, formed, at, different, times, and, eventually, connected, to, become, the, waterway, now, traversed, by, the, colorado, river, of, the, three, central, segments, the, hurricane, was, formed, 50, 70, million, years, ago, and, the, eastern, grand, canyon, was, cut, 15, 25, million, years, ago, in, contrast, the, marble, canyon, and, westernmost, grand, canyon, segments, at, the, ends, of, the, canyon, were, carved, in, the, last, five, to, six, million, years, the, major, geologic, exposures, in, the, grand, canyon, range, in, age, from, the, two, billion, year, old, vishnu, schist, at, the, bottom, of, the, inner, gorge, to, the, 270, million, year, old, kaibab, limestone, on, the, rim, there, is, a, gap, of, about, a, billion, years, between, 1, 75, billion, and, 1, 25, billion, years, ago, this, large, unconformity, indicates, a, long, period, for, which, no, deposits, are, present, then, between, 1, 25, billion, and, 730, million, years, ago, intermittent, sediments, began, to, form, the, grand, canyon, supergroup, many, of, the, formations, were, deposited, in, warm, shallow, seas, near, shore, environments, such, as, beaches, and, swamps, as, the, seashore, repeatedly, advanced, and, retreated, over, the, edge, of, a, proto, north, america, major, exceptions, include, the, permian, coconino, sandstone, which, contains, abundant, geological, evidence, of, aeolian, sand, dune, deposition, several, parts, of, the, supai, group, also, were, deposited, in, non, marine, environments, the, great, depth, of, the, grand, canyon, and, especially, the, height, of, its, strata, most, of, which, formed, below, sea, level, can, be, attributed, to, 5, 000, 10, 000, feet, 1, 500, 3, 000, m, of, uplift, of, the, colorado, plateau, starting, about, 65, million, years, ago, during, the, laramide, orogeny, this, uplift, has, steepened, the, stream, gradient, of, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, which, in, turn, has, increased, their, speed, and, thus, their, ability, to, cut, through, rock, see, the, elevation, summary, of, the, colorado, river, for, present, conditions, weather, conditions, during, the, ice, ages, also, increased, the, amount, of, water, in, the, colorado, river, drainage, system, the, ancestral, colorado, river, responded, by, cutting, its, channel, faster, and, deeper, the, base, level, and, course, of, the, colorado, river, or, its, ancestral, equivalent, changed, 5, 3, million, years, ago, when, the, gulf, of, california, opened, and, lowered, the, river, s, base, level, its, lowest, point, this, increased, the, rate, of, erosion, and, cut, nearly, all, of, the, grand, canyon, s, current, depth, by, 1, 2, million, years, ago, the, terraced, walls, of, the, canyon, were, created, by, differential, erosion, between, 100, 000, and, 3, million, years, ago, volcanic, activity, deposited, ash, and, lava, over, the, area, which, at, times, completely, obstructed, the, river, these, volcanic, rocks, are, the, youngest, in, the, canyon, groundwater, flow, in, the, grand, canyon, region, is, an, active, area, of, study, groundwater, forms, when, rain, soaks, down, into, the, earth, and, reaches, the, water, table, the, composition, of, the, earth, in, a, given, area, determines, its, permeability, the, ease, with, which, water, flows, through, it, sand, is, more, permeable, than, clay, less, permeable, rock, layers, composed, of, clay, can, block, the, passage, of, water, and, are, known, as, aquitards, more, permeable, areas, of, rock, that, hold, and, transport, groundwater, underground, are, known, as, aquifers, an, area, of, water, bounded, by, two, aquitards, is, called, a, confined, aquifer, while, water, below, the, surface, and, above, an, aquitard, is, called, an, unconfined, aquifer, the, different, geologic, levels, of, the, grand, canyon, have, created, two, major, aquifers, where, groundwater, collects, the, higher, c, aquifer, is, an, unconfined, aquifer, it, collects, groundwater, that, seeps, through, the, kaibab, and, toroweap, formations, into, the, coconino, sandstone, below, it, the, permian, hermit, formation, and, supai, group, provide, a, dense, barrier, groundwater, from, the, c, acquifer, can, flow, laterally, appearing, as, seeps, along, the, canyon, walls, at, the, base, of, the, coconino, sandstone, but, can, also, descend, vertically, through, fault, zones, to, recharge, the, underlying, confined, r, aquifer, the, r, aquifer, also, known, as, the, red, wall, muav, aquifer, is, a, karst, aquifer, it, involves, an, area, of, substantial, fracturing, through, the, redwall, limestone, temple, butte, formation, and, cambrian, muav, limestone, of, the, tonto, group, five, individual, systems, flow, through, the, r, aquifer, and, compose, the, regional, groundwater, flow, system, which, drains, into, the, grand, canyon, kaibab, uinkaret, kanab, marble, shinumo, cataract, and, blue, spring, the, flow, of, groundwater, in, the, grand, canyon, region, is, influenced, in, multiple, ways, by, geologic, faults, and, folds, discharge, from, the, r, aquifer, appears, as, springs, and, seeps, in, both, the, grand, canyon, and, tributary, canyons, springs, discharge, to, the, grand, canyon, in, areas, of, lower, paleozoic, carbonates, and, are, associated, with, geologic, faults, and, fractures, fractures, are, believed, to, provide, dominant, pathways, both, for, vertical, circulation, in, the, paleozoic, section, and, for, lateral, collection, and, transport, of, water, to, springs, deep, in, the, canyons, the, largest, springs, discharge, from, the, r, aquifer, a, smaller, number, of, springs, discharge, at, lower, rates, from, the, c, aquifer, much, of, the, water, that, could, potentially, recharge, the, aquifers, is, likely, released, as, springs, rather, than, reaching, the, aquifers, studies, of, the, chemical, composition, of, groundwater, at, sites, across, the, grand, canyon, region, indicate, that, groundwater, contains, a, fraction, of, modern, water, post, 1950, and, that, many, springs, have, a, mix, of, modern, water, and, older, groundwater, estimated, mean, ages, for, south, rim, groundwater, range, from, 6, years, old, san, francisco, peaks, to, nearly, 20, 000, years, old, bar, four, well, blue, spring, groundwater, age, in, the, south, rim, groundwater, system, also, correlates, to, longitude, with, age, increasing, from, east, to, west, from, red, canyon, to, boucher, springs, surprisingly, the, canyon, mine, observation, well, is, more, similar, to, redwall, muav, aquifer, wells, r, aquifer, than, to, the, coconino, c, aquifer, this, suggests, the, possibility, of, a, hydrologic, connection, or, similar, recharge, sources, for, that, hydrologic, position, old, groundwater, from, havasupai, well, may, have, a, similar, source, to, the, havasu, spring, upwelling, from, the, redwall, muav, aquifer, sites, with, younger, estimated, mean, ages, tend, to, be, associated, with, the, unconfined, coconino, aquifer, they, may, recharge, quickly, as, a, result, of, snowmelt, run, off, and, local, precipitation, it, is, likely, that, the, deeper, confined, r, aquifer, relies, primarily, on, snowmelt, from, the, san, francisco, peaks, to, recharge, other, research, has, tried, to, relate, groundwater, flow, paths, to, possible, levels, of, risk, for, contamination, and, identify, vulnerability, regions, for, the, underlying, aquifers, almost, half, of, the, kaibab, plateau, s, surface, was, associated, with, high, to, very, high, vulnerability, of, the, unconfined, coconino, aquifer, c, aquifer, while, about, a, fifth, of, the, kaibab, plateau, was, estimated, to, be, an, area, of, high, vulnerability, for, the, redwall, muav, aquifer, r, aquifer, the, ancestral, puebloans, were, a, native, american, culture, centered, on, the, present, day, four, corners, area, of, the, united, states, they, were, the, first, people, known, to, live, in, the, grand, canyon, area, the, cultural, group, has, often, been, referred, to, in, archaeology, as, the, anasazi, although, the, term, is, not, preferred, by, the, modern, puebloan, peoples, the, word, anasazi, is, navajo, for, enemy, ancestors, or, alien, ancestors, archaeologists, still, debate, when, this, distinct, culture, emerged, the, current, consensus, based, on, terminology, defined, by, the, pecos, classification, suggests, their, emergence, was, around, 1200, bce, during, the, basketmaker, ii, era, beginning, with, the, earliest, explorations, and, excavations, researchers, have, believed, that, the, ancestral, puebloans, are, ancestors, of, the, modern, pueblo, peoples, in, addition, to, the, ancestral, puebloans, a, number, of, distinct, cultures, have, inhabited, the, grand, canyon, area, the, cohonina, lived, to, the, west, of, the, grand, canyon, between, 500, and, 1200, ce, the, cohonina, were, ancestors, of, the, yuman, havasupai, and, hualapai, peoples, who, inhabit, the, area, today, the, sinagua, were, a, cultural, group, occupying, an, area, to, the, southeast, of, the, grand, canyon, between, the, little, colorado, river, and, the, salt, river, between, approximately, 500, and, 1425, ce, the, sinagua, may, have, been, ancestors, of, several, hopi, clans, by, the, time, of, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, the, 16th, century, newer, cultures, had, evolved, the, hualapai, inhabit, a, 100, mile, 160, km, stretch, along, the, pine, clad, southern, side, of, the, grand, canyon, the, havasupai, have, been, living, in, the, area, near, cataract, canyon, since, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, occupying, an, area, the, size, of, delaware, the, southern, paiutes, live, in, what, is, now, southern, utah, and, northern, arizona, the, navajo, or, din, live, in, a, wide, area, stretching, from, the, san, francisco, peaks, eastwards, towards, the, four, corners, archaeological, and, linguistic, evidence, suggests, the, navajo, descended, from, the, athabaskan, people, near, great, slave, lake, canada, who, migrated, after, the, 11th, century, in, the, mythology, of, some, third, mesa, hopi, communities, the, grand, canyon, was, the, location, humankind, arose, out, of, the, third, world, from, a, sipapu, in, september, 1540, under, orders, from, the, conquistador, francisco, v, zquez, de, coronado, to, search, for, the, fabled, seven, cities, of, cibola, captain, garc, a, l, pez, de, c, rdenas, along, with, hopi, guides, and, a, small, group, of, spanish, soldiers, traveled, to, the, south, rim, of, the, grand, canyon, between, desert, view, and, moran, point, pablo, de, melgrossa, juan, galeras, and, a, third, soldier, descended, some, one, third, of, the, way, into, the, canyon, until, they, were, forced, to, return, because, of, lack, of, water, in, their, report, they, noted, that, some, of, the, rocks, in, the, canyon, were, bigger, than, the, great, tower, of, seville, giralda, it, is, speculated, that, their, hopi, guides, likely, knew, routes, to, the, canyon, floor, but, may, have, been, reluctant, to, lead, the, spanish, to, the, river, no, europeans, visited, the, canyon, again, for, more, than, two, hundred, years, fathers, francisco, atanasio, dom, nguez, and, silvestre, v, lez, de, escalante, were, two, spanish, priests, who, with, a, group, of, spanish, soldiers, explored, southern, utah, and, traveled, along, the, north, rim, of, the, canyon, in, glen, and, marble, canyons, in, search, of, a, route, from, santa, fe, to, california, in, 1776, they, eventually, found, a, crossing, formerly, known, as, the, crossing, of, the, fathers, that, today, lies, under, lake, powell, also, in, 1776, fray, francisco, garces, a, franciscan, missionary, spent, a, week, near, havasupai, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, convert, a, band, of, native, americans, to, christianity, he, described, the, canyon, as, profound, james, ohio, pattie, along, with, a, group, of, american, trappers, and, mountain, men, may, have, been, the, next, european, to, reach, the, canyon, in, 1826, jacob, hamblin, a, mormon, missionary, was, sent, by, brigham, young, in, the, 1850s, to, locate, suitable, river, crossing, sites, in, the, canyon, building, good, relations, with, local, hualapai, and, white, settlers, he, reached, the, crossing, of, the, fathers, crossed, the, location, that, would, become, lees, ferry, on, a, raft, in, 1858, and, pearce, ferry, later, operated, by, and, named, for, harrison, pearce, he, also, acted, as, an, advisor, to, john, wesley, powell, before, his, second, expedition, to, the, grand, canyon, serving, as, a, diplomat, between, powell, and, the, local, native, tribes, to, ensure, the, safety, of, his, party, in, 1857, edward, fitzgerald, beale, was, superintendent, of, an, expedition, to, survey, a, wagon, road, along, the, 35th, parallel, from, fort, defiance, arizona, to, the, colorado, river, he, led, a, small, party, of, men, in, search, of, water, on, the, coconino, plateau, near, the, canyon, s, south, rim, on, september, 19, near, present, day, national, canyon, they, came, upon, what, may, humphreys, stacey, described, in, his, journal, as, a, wonderful, canyon, four, thousand, feet, deep, everybody, in, the, party, admitted, that, he, never, before, saw, anything, to, match, or, equal, this, astonishing, natural, curiosity, also, in, 1857, the, u, s, war, department, asked, lieutenant, joseph, ives, to, lead, an, expedition, to, assess, the, feasibility, of, an, up, river, navigation, from, the, gulf, of, california, on, december, 31, 1857, ives, embarked, from, the, mouth, of, the, colorado, in, the, stern, wheeler, steamboat, explorer, his, party, reached, the, lower, end, of, black, canyon, on, march, 8, 1858, then, continued, on, by, rowboat, past, the, mouth, of, the, virgin, river, after, the, explorer, struck, a, rock, ives, led, his, party, east, into, the, canyon, they, may, have, been, the, first, europeans, to, travel, the, diamond, creek, drainage, in, his, report, upon, the, colorado, river, of, the, west, to, the, senate, in, 1861, ives, states, that, the, marvellous, story, of, cardinas, that, had, formed, for, so, long, a, time, the, only, record, concerning, this, rather, mythical, locality, was, rather, magnified, than, detracted, from, by, the, accounts, of, one, or, two, trappers, who, professed, to, have, seen, the, ca, on, according, to, the, san, francisco, herald, in, a, series, of, articles, run, in, 1853, captain, joseph, r, walker, in, january, 1851, with, his, nephew, james, t, walker, and, six, men, traveled, up, the, colorado, river, to, a, point, where, it, joined, the, virgin, river, and, continued, east, into, arizona, traveling, along, the, grand, canyon, and, making, short, exploratory, side, trips, along, the, way, walker, is, reported, to, have, said, he, wanted, to, visit, the, moqui, hopi, indians, who, he, had, met, briefly, before, and, found, exceptionally, interesting, in, 1858, john, strong, newberry, became, probably, the, first, geologist, to, visit, the, grand, canyon, in, 1869, major, john, wesley, powell, set, out, to, explore, the, colorado, river, and, the, grand, canyon, in, the, first, expedition, down, the, canyon, powell, ordered, a, shipwright, to, build, four, reinforced, whitewall, rowboats, from, chicago, and, had, them, shipped, west, on, the, newly, completed, continental, railroad, he, hired, nine, men, including, his, brother, walter, and, collected, provisions, for, ten, months, they, set, out, from, green, river, wyoming, on, may, 24, on, june, 7, they, lost, one, of, their, boats, 1, 3, of, their, food, and, other, badly, needed, supplies, as, a, result, the, team, eventually, had, to, subsist, on, starvation, rations, passing, through, or, portaging, around, a, series, of, dangerous, rapids, the, group, passed, down, the, green, river, reaching, its, confluence, with, the, colorado, river, near, present, day, moab, utah, on, july, 17, continuing, on, down, the, colorado, river, the, party, encountered, more, rapids, and, falls, on, august, 28, 1869, faced, with, what, some, felt, to, be, impassable, rapids, three, men, left, the, expedition, on, foot, in, an, attempt, to, reach, a, settlement, 75, miles, 121, km, away, ironically, the, remaining, members, went, safely, through, the, rapids, on, august, 29, 1869, while, seneca, howland, oramel, howland, and, william, h, dunn, were, murdered, the, area, through, which, the, three, men, traveled, was, marked, by, tensions, between, farming, and, hunting, shivwits, and, incoming, mormon, settlers, which, group, was, responsible, for, killing, the, three, men, has, been, hotly, debated, powell, himself, visited, the, area, the, following, year, and, was, told, through, a, mormon, interpreter, that, the, shivwits, had, mistakenly, killed, the, men, believing, them, to, be, prospectors, who, had, murdered, an, indian, woman, he, chose, to, smoke, a, peace, pipe, with, them, powell, went, on, to, become, the, first, director, of, the, u, s, bureau, of, ethnology, of, the, smithsonian, institution, 1879, 1902, and, the, second, director, of, the, us, geological, survey, 1881, 1894, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, grand, canyon, in, 1871, previously, it, had, been, called, the, big, canyon, in, 1889, frank, m, brown, wanted, to, build, a, railroad, along, the, colorado, river, to, carry, coal, he, his, chief, engineer, robert, brewster, stanton, and, 14, others, started, to, explore, the, grand, canyon, in, poorly, designed, cedar, wood, boats, with, no, life, preservers, brown, drowned, in, an, accident, near, marble, canyon, stanton, made, new, boats, and, proceeded, to, explore, the, colorado, all, of, the, way, to, the, gulf, of, california, the, grand, canyon, became, an, official, national, monument, in, 1908, and, a, national, park, in, 1919, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, visited, the, grand, canyon, in, 1903, an, avid, outdoorsman, and, staunch, conservationist, roosevelt, established, the, grand, canyon, game, preserve, on, november, 28, 1906, livestock, grazing, was, reduced, but, predators, such, as, mountain, lions, eagles, and, wolves, were, eradicated, roosevelt, along, with, other, members, of, his, conservation, group, the, boone, and, crockett, club, helped, form, the, national, parks, association, which, in, turn, lobbied, for, the, antiquities, act, of, 1906, which, gave, roosevelt, the, power, to, create, national, monuments, once, the, act, was, passed, roosevelt, immediately, added, adjacent, national, forest, lands, and, redesignated, the, preserve, a, u, s, national, monument, on, january, 11, 1908, opponents, such, as, land, and, mining, claim, holders, blocked, efforts, to, reclassify, the, monument, as, a, u, s, national, park, for, 11, years, grand, canyon, national, park, was, finally, established, as, the, 17th, u, s, national, park, by, an, act, of, congress, signed, into, law, by, president, woodrow, wilson, on, february, 26, 1919, the, federal, government, administrators, who, manage, park, resources, face, many, challenges, these, include, issues, related, to, the, recent, reintroduction, into, the, wild, of, the, highly, endangered, california, condor, air, tour, overflight, noise, levels, water, rights, and, management, disputes, and, forest, fire, management, the, canyon, s, ecosystem, was, permanently, changed, after, the, construction, of, the, glen, canyon, dam, in, 1963, average, flood, levels, dropped, from, 85, 000, to, 8, 000, cubic, ft, sec, in, the, absence, of, natural, flooding, sandbars, and, beaches, eroded, and, invasive, species, began, to, displace, native, species, federal, officials, started, releasing, floods, in, the, grand, canyon, in, hopes, of, restoring, its, ecosystem, beginning, with, 1996, 2004, and, 2008, in, 2018, the, department, of, interior, started, experimenting, with, adaptive, management, of, the, glen, canyon, dam, using, a, high, flow, experiment, hfe, water, release, to, shift, volumes, of, sand, and, monitoring, effects, such, as, the, dispersal, of, invasive, tamarisk, seeds, however, as, of, 2022, extreme, drought, has, caused, water, levels, in, lake, powell, to, drop, so, much, that, a, planned, release, of, water, has, been, delayed, to, ensure, that, the, glen, canyon, dam, can, continue, to, generate, hydropower, between, 2003, and, 2011, 2, 215, mining, claims, had, been, requested, that, are, adjacent, to, the, canyon, including, claims, for, uranium, mines, critics, of, uranium, mining, are, concerned, that, uranium, will, leach, into, the, aquifers, feeding, the, colorado, river, and, contaminate, the, water, supply, for, up, to, 18, million, people, in, 2009, u, s, interior, secretary, ken, salazar, published, a, notice, of, intent, to, suspend, approvals, for, new, uranium, mining, in, the, area, in, 2012, salazar, established, a, 20, year, moratorium, known, as, the, northern, arizona, withdrawal, withdrawing, 1, million, acres, 4, 000, km, 2, from, the, permitting, process, for, uranium, and, hardrock, mining, stating, people, from, all, over, the, country, and, around, the, world, come, to, visit, the, grand, canyon, numerous, american, indian, tribes, regard, this, magnificent, icon, as, a, sacred, place, and, millions, of, people, in, the, colorado, river, basin, depend, on, the, river, for, drinking, water, irrigation, industrial, and, environmental, use, however, salazar, s, 20, year, moratorium, on, new, mines, still, allows, mines, with, previous, authorization, to, operate, multiple, challenges, have, been, brought, into, court, both, against, the, moratorium, and, against, the, operation, of, uranium, mines, in, the, area, the, federal, government, s, 2012, moratorium, was, upheld, by, the, u, s, district, court, for, arizona, in, 2014, but, appealed, in, november, 2014, as, national, mining, association, v, jewell, no, 14, 17350, the, 9th, circuit, court, of, appeals, again, upheld, the, moratorium, in, 2017, stating, that, the, secretary, of, the, interior, held, valid, withdrawal, authority, havasupai, tribe, v, provencio, was, also, argued, at, multiple, court, levels, based, on, multiple, grounds, the, havasupai, people, and, the, grand, canyon, trust, sought, to, block, the, reopening, of, the, pinyon, plain, mine, formerly, canyon, uranium, mine, activity, at, the, mine, had, ceased, in, 1992, ten, years, prior, to, the, moratorium, on, new, development, in, 2012, appellants, challenged, the, u, s, forest, service, s, consultation, process, for, approving, reopening, of, the, mine, as, of, february, 22, 2022, the, 9th, u, s, circuit, court, of, appeals, rejected, the, arguments, in, no, 20, 16401, concluding, that, the, forest, service, had, not, acted, arbitrarily, in, making, its, decision, a, study, examining, samples, of, groundwater, from, 180, spring, sites, and, 26, wells, in, the, grand, canyon, region, has, assessed, the, presence, of, uranium, in, groundwater, from, september, 1, 1981, to, october, 7, 2020, the, goal, of, the, study, was, to, establish, a, baseline, assessment, of, groundwater, conditions, in, the, grand, canyon, region, at, 95, of, sites, maximum, observed, uranium, concentrations, were, below, the, epa, s, maximum, contaminant, level, for, drinking, water, 30, g, l, at, 86, of, sites, uranium, concentrations, were, below, the, canadian, level, for, protection, of, freshwater, aquatic, life, 15, g, l, on, august, 8, 2023, it, was, announced, that, u, s, president, joe, biden, will, designate, baaj, nwaavjo, i, tah, kukveni, ancestral, footprints, of, the, grand, canyon, national, monument, a, move, aimed, at, conserving, nearly, 1, million, acres, of, greater, grand, canyon, landscape, there, are, several, historic, buildings, located, along, the, south, rim, with, most, in, the, vicinity, of, grand, canyon, village, weather, in, the, grand, canyon, varies, according, to, elevation, the, forested, rims, are, high, enough, to, receive, winter, snowfall, but, along, the, colorado, river, in, the, inner, gorge, temperatures, are, similar, to, those, found, in, tucson, and, other, low, elevation, desert, locations, in, arizona, conditions, in, the, grand, canyon, region, are, generally, dry, but, substantial, precipitation, occurs, twice, annually, during, seasonal, pattern, shifts, in, winter, when, pacific, storms, usually, deliver, widespread, moderate, rain, and, high, elevation, snow, to, the, region, from, the, west, and, in, late, summer, due, to, the, north, american, monsoon, which, delivers, waves, of, moisture, from, the, southeast, causing, dramatic, localized, thunderstorms, fueled, by, the, heat, of, the, day, average, annual, precipitation, on, the, south, rim, is, less, than, 16, inches, 41, cm, with, 60, inches, 150, cm, of, snow, the, higher, north, rim, usually, receives, 27, inches, 69, cm, of, moisture, with, a, typical, snowfall, of, 144, inches, 370, cm, and, phantom, ranch, far, below, the, canyon, s, rims, along, the, colorado, river, at, 2, 500, feet, 760, m, gets, just, 8, inches, 200, mm, of, rain, and, snow, is, a, rarity, temperatures, vary, wildly, throughout, the, year, with, summer, highs, within, the, inner, gorge, commonly, exceeding, 100, f, 38, c, and, winter, minimum, temperatures, sometimes, falling, below, zero, degrees, fahrenheit, 18, c, along, the, canyon, s, rims, visitors, are, often, surprised, by, these, potentially, extreme, conditions, and, this, along, with, the, high, altitude, of, the, canyon, s, rims, can, lead, to, unpleasant, side, effects, such, as, dehydration, sunburn, and, hypothermia, weather, conditions, can, greatly, affect, hiking, and, canyon, exploration, and, visitors, should, obtain, accurate, forecasts, because, of, hazards, posed, by, exposure, to, extreme, temperatures, winter, storms, and, late, summer, monsoons, while, the, park, service, posts, weather, information, at, gates, and, visitor, centers, this, is, a, rough, approximation, only, and, should, not, be, relied, upon, for, trip, planning, for, accurate, weather, in, the, canyon, hikers, should, consult, the, national, weather, service, s, noaa, weather, radio, or, the, official, national, weather, service, website, the, national, weather, service, has, had, a, cooperative, station, on, the, south, rim, since, 1903, the, record, high, temperature, on, the, south, rim, was, 105, f, 41, c, on, june, 26, 1974, and, the, record, low, temperature, was, 20, f, 29, c, on, january, 1, 1919, february, 1, 1985, and, december, 23, 1990, as, of, 1999, the, grand, canyon, area, had, some, of, the, cleanest, air, in, the, united, states, p, 5, 2, however, air, quality, in, the, area, can, be, affected, by, air, pollution, from, coal, fired, power, plants, mining, oil, and, gas, vehicles, and, urban, and, industrial, pollution, from, nearby, states, california, and, mexico, events, such, as, forest, fires, and, dust, storms, in, the, southwest, can, have, a, considerable, impact, differences, in, visibility, tend, to, be, seasonal, best, during, the, winter, and, poorest, during, the, summer, winter, cold, fronts, tend, to, carry, clean, crisp, air, from, the, northwest, a, less, populated, area, however, they, can, also, carry, pollution, from, nearby, mines, and, power, plants, the, average, visibility, during, the, winter, is, 160, miles, with, the, potential, to, reach, 210, miles, under, ideal, conditions, in, the, summer, prevailing, winds, from, the, southwest, carry, pollution, from, major, urban, and, industrial, centers, and, visibility, on, average, is, only, 100, miles, within, the, canyon, itself, smog, can, be, trapped, air, quality, and, visibility, in, the, canyon, are, affected, mainly, by, sulfates, soils, and, organics, the, sulfates, largely, result, from, urban, emissions, in, southern, california, borne, on, the, prevailing, westerly, winds, throughout, much, of, the, year, and, emissions, from, arizona, s, copper, smelter, region, borne, on, southerly, or, southeasterly, winds, during, the, monsoon, airborne, soils, originate, with, windy, conditions, and, road, dust, organic, particles, result, from, vehicle, emissions, long, range, transport, from, urban, areas, and, forest, fires, as, well, as, from, vocs, emitted, by, vegetation, in, the, surrounding, forests, nitrates, carried, in, from, urban, areas, stationary, sources, and, vehicle, emissions, as, well, as, black, carbon, from, forest, fires, and, vehicle, emissions, also, contribute, to, a, lesser, extent, 26, 49, 51, a, number, of, actions, have, been, taken, to, preserve, and, further, improve, air, quality, and, visibility, at, the, canyon, in, 1990, amendments, to, the, clean, air, act, established, the, grand, canyon, visibility, transport, commission, gcvtc, to, advise, the, us, epa, on, strategies, for, protecting, visual, air, quality, on, the, colorado, plateau, the, gcvtc, released, its, final, report, in, 1996, and, initiated, the, western, regional, air, partnership, wrap, a, partnership, of, state, tribal, and, federal, agencies, to, help, coordinate, the, implementation, of, the, commission, s, recommendations, in, 1999, the, regional, haze, rule, established, a, goal, of, restoring, visibility, in, national, parks, and, wilderness, areas, class, 1, areas, such, as, the, grand, canyon, to, natural, background, levels, by, 2064, subsequent, revisions, to, the, rule, provide, specific, requirements, for, making, reasonable, progress, toward, that, goal, in, the, early, 1990s, studies, indicated, that, emissions, of, so, 2, a, sulfate, precursor, from, the, navajo, generating, station, affected, visibility, in, the, canyon, mainly, in, the, winter, p, c, 2, c, 6, as, a, result, scrubbers, were, added, to, the, plant, s, three, units, in, 1997, through, 1999, to, reduce, so2, emissions, by, 90, on, an, annual, average, before, and, after, observations, showed, a, wintertime, decrease, of, 33, for, particulate, sulfur, sp, improving, visibility, the, plant, also, installed, low, no, x, sofa, burners, in, 2009, 2011, reducing, emissions, of, no, x, a, nitrate, precursor, by, 40, the, plant, shut, down, completely, in, 2019, emissions, from, the, mohave, generating, station, to, the, west, were, similarly, found, to, affect, visibility, in, the, canyon, the, plant, was, required, to, have, installed, so, 2, scrubbers, but, was, instead, shut, down, in, 2005, completely, eliminating, its, emissions, prescribed, fires, are, typically, conducted, in, the, spring, and, fall, in, the, forests, adjacent, to, the, canyon, to, reduce, the, potential, for, severe, forest, fires, and, resulting, smoke, conditions, although, prescribed, fires, also, affect, air, quality, the, controlled, conditions, allow, the, use, of, management, techniques, to, minimize, their, impact, p, 86, 93, due, to, the, increase, of, greenhouse, gases, temperatures, have, steadily, risen, making, recent, years, the, warmest, in, the, century, long, record, temperatures, have, increased, in, arizona, by, 2, 1, degrees, fahrenheit, since, 1895, from, 1916, to, 2014, naturalized, streamflow, in, the, upper, colorado, river, basin, decreased, by, 16, 5, in, spite, of, a, slight, increase, of, 1, 4, in, annual, precipitation, over, the, same, period, increases, in, temperature, correlate, to, increased, evaporation, loss, of, reflective, snow, and, decreases, in, snowpack, reducing, available, water, in, the, colorado, river, by, an, estimated, 9, 3, per, degree, celsius, of, warming, over, the, last, 30, years, the, south, rim, of, the, grand, canyon, has, averaged, 13, 4, inches, of, rainfall, per, year, while, the, north, rim, has, averaged, 24, inches, the, first, dual, distribution, water, system, in, the, united, states, was, built, on, the, south, rim, treating, and, reclaiming, wastewater, for, nonpotable, reuse, as, early, as, 1926, early, on, water, for, human, use, was, brought, in, by, tankers, and, pumped, up, from, a, spring, deeper, in, the, canyon, in, the, 1960s, the, transcanyon, pipeline, was, built, to, carry, water, from, the, north, rim, down, into, the, canyon, and, back, up, to, the, south, rim, every, day, 500, 000, gallons, of, water, are, pumped, from, underground, springs, on, the, north, rim, through, the, pipeline, to, supply, the, more, heavily, developed, south, rim, with, water, as, water, consumption, continues, to, soar, due, to, increasing, visitation, in, the, park, both, the, sustainability, of, the, water, supply, and, the, condition, of, the, pipeline, are, in, question, as, of, 2019, plans, to, replace, the, aging, 16, mile, aluminum, pipeline, were, proposed, another, proposal, from, the, bureau, of, reclamation, recommended, that, the, park, drill, a, well, into, the, redwall, muav, aquifer, to, meet, the, increasing, water, consumption, however, the, aquifer, s, recharge, rate, stands, to, decline, over, time, due, to, decreases, in, precipitation, and, snowpack, some, effects, of, over, pumping, aquifers, include, land, subsidence, reduction, in, rivers, and, lakes, disrupted, riparian, systems, and, poor, water, quality, in, the, national, park, service, s, climate, action, plan, goals, were, set, to, reduce, greenhouse, gases, 30, percent, below, 2008, levels, by, 2020, and, plan, and, implement, measures, that, best, allow, the, park, to, adapt, to, the, impacts, of, climate, change, strategies, to, accomplish, these, goals, included, reduce, emissions, resulting, from, activities, within, and, by, the, park, developing, and, implementing, a, plan, to, adapt, to, current, and, future, impacts, of, climate, change, increase, climate, change, education, and, outreach, and, monitor, progress, and, identify, areas, for, improvement, there, are, approximately, 1, 737, known, species, of, vascular, plants, 167, species, of, fungi, 64, species, of, moss, and, 195, species, of, lichen, found, in, grand, canyon, national, park, this, variety, is, largely, due, to, the, 8, 000, foot, 2, 400, m, elevation, change, from, the, colorado, river, up, to, the, highest, point, on, the, north, rim, grand, canyon, boasts, a, dozen, endemic, plants, known, only, within, the, park, s, boundaries, while, only, ten, percent, of, the, park, s, flora, is, exotic, sixty, three, plants, found, here, have, been, given, special, status, by, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, the, mojave, desert, influences, the, western, sections, of, the, canyon, sonoran, desert, vegetation, covers, the, eastern, sections, and, ponderosa, and, pinyon, pine, forests, grow, on, both, rims, natural, seeps, and, springs, percolating, out, of, the, canyon, walls, are, home, to, 11, of, all, the, plant, species, found, in, the, grand, canyon, the, canyon, itself, can, act, as, a, connection, between, the, east, and, the, west, by, providing, corridors, of, appropriate, habitat, along, its, length, the, canyon, can, also, be, a, genetic, barrier, to, some, species, like, the, tassel, eared, squirrel, the, aspect, or, direction, a, slope, faces, also, plays, a, major, role, in, adding, diversity, to, the, grand, canyon, north, facing, slopes, receive, about, one, third, the, normal, amount, of, sunlight, so, plants, growing, there, are, similar, to, plants, found, at, higher, elevations, or, in, more, northern, latitudes, the, south, facing, slopes, receive, the, full, amount, of, sunlight, and, are, covered, in, vegetation, typical, of, the, sonoran, desert, of, the, 90, mammal, species, found, along, the, colorado, river, corridor, 18, are, rodents, and, 22, are, bats, the, park, contains, several, major, ecosystems, its, great, biological, diversity, can, be, attributed, to, the, presence, of, five, of, the, seven, life, zones, and, three, of, the, four, desert, types, in, north, america, the, five, life, zones, represented, are, the, lower, sonoran, upper, sonoran, transition, canadian, and, hudsonian, this, is, equivalent, to, traveling, from, mexico, to, canada, differences, in, elevation, and, the, resulting, variations, in, climate, are, the, major, factors, that, form, the, various, life, zones, and, communities, in, and, around, the, canyon, grand, canyon, national, park, contains, 129, vegetation, communities, and, the, composition, and, distribution, of, plant, species, are, influenced, by, climate, geomorphology, and, geology, the, lower, sonoran, life, zone, spans, from, the, colorado, river, up, to, 3, 500, feet, 1, 100, m, along, the, colorado, river, and, its, perennial,

hanging, gardens, seeps, and, springs, often, contain, rare, plants, such, as, the, white, flowering, western, redbud, stream, orchid, and, flaveria, mcdougallii, endangered, fish, in, the, river, include, the, humpback, chub, and, the, razorback, sucker, the, three, most, common, amphibians, in, these, riparian, communities, are, the, canyon, tree, frog, red, spotted, toad, and, woodhouse, s, rocky, mountain, toad, leopard, frogs, are, very, rare, in, the, colorado, river, corridor, they, have, undergone, major, declines, and, have, not, been, seen, in, the, canyon, in, several, years, there, are, 33, crustacean, species, found, in, the, colorado, river, and, its, tributaries, within, grand, canyon, national, park, of, these, 33, 16, are, considered, true, zooplankton, organisms, only, 48, bird, species, regularly, nest, along, the, river, while, others, use, the, river, as, a, migration, corridor, or, as, an, overwintering, habitat, the, bald, eagle, is, one, species, that, uses, the, river, corridor, as, a, winter, habitat, river, otters, may, have, disappeared, from, the, park, in, the, late, 20th, century, and, muskrats, are, extremely, rare, beavers, cut, willows, cottonwoods, and, shrubs, for, food, and, can, significantly, affect, the, riparian, vegetation, other, rodents, such, as, antelope, squirrels, and, pocket, mice, are, mostly, omnivorous, using, many, different, vegetation, types, grand, canyon, bats, typically, roost, in, desert, uplands, but, forage, on, the, abundance, of, insects, along, the, river, and, its, tributaries, in, addition, to,
