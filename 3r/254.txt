easter, island, spanish, isla, de, pascua, rapa, nui, rapa, nui, is, an, island, and, special, territory, of, chile, in, the, southeastern, pacific, ocean, at, the, southeasternmost, point, of, the, polynesian, triangle, in, oceania, the, island, is, most, famous, for, its, nearly, 1, 000, extant, monumental, statues, called, moai, which, were, created, by, the, early, rapa, nui, people, in, 1995, unesco, named, easter, island, a, world, heritage, site, with, much, of, the, island, protected, within, rapa, nui, national, park, experts, disagree, on, when, the, island, s, polynesian, inhabitants, first, reached, the, island, while, many, in, the, research, community, cited, evidence, that, they, arrived, around, the, year, 800, a, 2007, study, found, compelling, evidence, that, they, arrived, closer, to, 1200, the, inhabitants, created, a, thriving, and, industrious, culture, as, evidenced, by, the, island, s, numerous, enormous, stone, moai, and, other, artifacts, but, land, clearing, for, cultivation, and, the, introduction, of, the, polynesian, rat, led, to, gradual, deforestation, by, the, time, of, european, arrival, in, 1722, the, island, s, population, was, estimated, to, be, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, european, diseases, peruvian, slave, raiding, expeditions, in, the, 1860s, and, emigration, to, other, islands, such, as, tahiti, further, depleted, the, population, reducing, it, to, a, low, of, 111, native, inhabitants, in, 1877, chile, annexed, easter, island, in, 1888, in, 1966, the, rapa, nui, were, granted, chilean, citizenship, in, 2007, the, island, gained, the, constitutional, status, of, special, territory, spanish, territorio, especial, administratively, it, belongs, to, the, valpara, so, region, constituting, a, single, commune, isla, de, pascua, of, the, province, of, isla, de, pascua, the, 2017, chilean, census, registered, 7, 750, people, on, the, island, of, whom, 3, 512, 45, considered, themselves, rapa, nui, easter, island, is, one, of, the, world, s, remotest, inhabited, islands, the, nearest, inhabited, land, around, 50, residents, in, 2013, is, pitcairn, island, 2, 075, kilometres, 1, 289, mi, away, the, nearest, town, with, a, population, over, 500, is, rikitea, on, the, island, of, mangareva, 2, 606, km, 1, 619, mi, away, the, nearest, continental, point, lies, in, central, chile, 3, 512, km, 2, 182, mi, away, the, name, easter, island, was, given, by, the, island, s, first, recorded, european, visitor, the, dutch, explorer, jacob, roggeveen, who, encountered, it, on, easter, sunday, 5, april, 1722, while, searching, for, davis, land, roggeveen, named, it, paasch, eyland, 18th, century, dutch, for, easter, island, the, island, s, official, spanish, name, isla, de, pascua, also, means, easter, island, the, current, polynesian, name, of, the, island, rapa, nui, big, rapa, was, coined, after, the, slave, raids, of, the, early, 1860s, and, refers, to, the, island, s, topographic, resemblance, to, the, island, of, rapa, in, the, bass, islands, of, the, austral, islands, group, norwegian, ethnographer, thor, heyerdahl, argued, that, rapa, was, easter, island, s, original, name, and, that, the, bass, islands, rapa, rapa, iti, was, named, by, refugees, from, it, the, phrase, te, pito, o, te, henua, has, been, said, to, be, the, island, s, original, name, since, french, ethnologist, alphonse, pinart, gave, it, the, romantic, translation, the, navel, of, the, world, in, his, voyage, l, le, de, p, ques, published, in, 1877, william, churchill, 1912, inquired, about, the, phrase, and, was, told, that, there, were, three, te, pito, o, te, henua, these, being, the, three, capes, land, s, ends, of, the, island, the, phrase, appears, to, have, been, used, in, the, same, sense, as, the, designation, land, s, end, at, the, tip, of, cornwall, he, was, unable, to, elicit, a, polynesian, name, for, the, island, and, concluded, that, there, may, not, have, been, one, according, to, barthel, 1974, oral, tradition, has, it, that, the, island, was, first, named, te, pito, o, te, kainga, a, hau, maka, the, little, piece, of, land, of, hau, maka, but, there, are, two, words, pronounced, pito, in, rapa, nui, one, meaning, end, and, one, navel, and, the, phrase, can, thus, also, mean, the, navel, of, the, world, another, name, mata, ki, te, rangi, means, eyes, looking, to, the, sky, islanders, are, referred, to, in, spanish, as, pascuense, but, members, of, the, indigenous, community, are, commonly, called, rapa, nui, felipe, gonz, lez, de, ahedo, named, it, isla, de, san, carlos, saint, charles, s, island, the, patron, saint, of, charles, iii, of, spain, or, isla, de, david, probably, the, phantom, island, of, davis, land, sometimes, translated, as, davis, s, island, in, 1770, oral, tradition, states, the, island, was, first, settled, by, a, two, canoe, expedition, originating, from, marae, renga, or, marae, toe, hau, otherwise, known, as, cook, islands, and, led, by, the, chief, hotu, matu, a, and, his, captain, tu, u, ko, iho, the, island, was, first, scouted, after, haumaka, dreamed, of, such, a, far, off, country, hotu, deemed, it, a, worthwhile, place, to, flee, from, a, neighboring, chief, one, to, whom, he, had, already, lost, three, battles, at, their, time, of, arrival, the, island, had, one, lone, settler, nga, tavake, a, te, rona, after, a, brief, stay, at, anakena, the, colonists, settled, in, different, parts, of, the, island, hotu, s, heir, tu, u, ma, heke, was, born, on, the, island, tu, u, ko, iho, is, viewed, as, the, leader, who, brought, the, statues, and, caused, them, to, walk, the, easter, islanders, are, considered, southeast, polynesians, similar, sacred, zones, with, statuary, marae, and, ahu, in, east, polynesia, demonstrate, homology, with, most, of, eastern, polynesia, at, contact, populations, were, about, 3, 000, 4, 000, 17, 18, 20, 21, 31, 41, 45, by, the, 15th, century, two, confederations, hanau, of, social, groupings, mata, existed, based, on, lineage, the, western, and, northern, portion, of, the, island, belonged, to, the, tu, u, which, included, the, royal, miru, with, the, royal, center, at, anakena, though, tahai, and, te, peu, served, as, earlier, capitals, the, eastern, part, of, the, island, belonged, to, the, otu, itu, shortly, after, the, dutch, visit, from, 1724, until, 1750, the, otu, itu, fought, the, tu, u, for, control, of, the, island, this, continued, until, the, 1860s, famine, followed, the, burning, of, huts, and, the, destruction, of, fields, social, control, vanished, as, the, ordered, way, of, life, gave, way, to, lawlessness, and, predatory, bands, as, the, warrior, class, took, over, homelessness, prevailed, with, many, living, underground, after, the, spanish, visit, from, 1770, onward, a, period, of, statue, toppling, huri, mo, ai, commenced, this, was, an, attempt, by, competing, groups, to, destroy, the, socio, spiritual, power, or, mana, represented, by, statues, making, sure, to, break, them, in, the, fall, to, ensure, they, were, dead, and, without, power, none, were, left, standing, by, the, time, of, the, arrival, of, the, french, missionaries, in, the, 1860s, 21, 24, 27, 54, 56, 64, 65, between, 1862, and, 1888, about, 94, of, the, population, perished, or, emigrated, the, island, was, victimized, by, blackbirding, from, 1862, to, 1863, resulting, in, the, abduction, or, killing, of, about, 1, 500, with, 1, 408, working, as, indentured, servants, in, peru, only, about, a, dozen, eventually, returned, to, easter, island, but, they, brought, smallpox, which, decimated, the, remaining, population, of, 1, 500, those, who, perished, included, the, island, s, tumu, ivi, atua, bearers, of, the, island, s, culture, history, and, genealogy, besides, the, rongorongo, experts, 86, 91, estimated, dates, of, initial, settlement, of, easter, island, have, ranged, from, 400, to, 1300, ce, though, the, current, best, estimate, for, colonization, is, in, the, 12th, century, ce, easter, island, colonization, likely, coincided, with, the, arrival, of, the, first, settlers, in, hawaii, rectifications, in, radiocarbon, dating, have, changed, almost, all, of, the, previously, posited, early, settlement, dates, in, polynesia, ongoing, archaeological, studies, provide, this, late, date, radiocarbon, dates, for, the, earliest, stratigraphic, layers, at, anakena, easter, island, and, analysis, of, previous, radiocarbon, dates, imply, that, the, island, was, colonized, late, about, 1200, ce, significant, ecological, impacts, and, major, cultural, investments, in, monumental, architecture, and, statuary, thus, began, soon, after, initial, settlement, according, to, oral, tradition, the, first, settlement, was, at, anakena, researchers, have, noted, that, the, caleta, anakena, landing, point, provides, the, island, s, best, shelter, from, prevailing, swells, as, well, as, a, sandy, beach, for, canoe, landings, and, launchings, so, it, is, a, likely, early, place, of, settlement, however, radiocarbon, dating, concludes, that, other, sites, preceded, anakena, by, many, years, especially, the, tahai, by, several, centuries, the, island, was, populated, by, polynesians, who, most, likely, navigated, in, canoes, or, catamarans, from, the, gambier, islands, mangareva, 2, 600, km, 1, 600, mi, away, or, the, marquesas, islands, 3, 200, km, 2, 000, mi, away, according, to, some, theories, such, as, the, polynesian, diaspora, theory, there, is, a, possibility, that, early, polynesian, settlers, arrived, from, south, america, due, to, their, remarkable, sea, navigation, abilities, theorists, have, supported, this, through, the, agricultural, evidence, of, the, sweet, potato, the, sweet, potato, was, a, favoured, crop, in, polynesian, society, for, generations, but, it, originated, in, south, america, suggesting, interaction, between, these, two, geographic, areas, however, recent, research, suggests, that, sweet, potatoes, may, have, spread, to, polynesia, by, long, distance, dispersal, long, before, the, polynesians, arrived, when, james, cook, visited, the, island, one, of, his, crew, members, a, polynesian, from, bora, bora, hitihiti, was, able, to, communicate, with, the, rapa, nui, 296, 297, it, has, been, noted, that, the, early, jumping, off, points, for, the, early, polynesian, colonization, of, easter, island, are, more, likely, to, have, been, from, mangareva, pitcairn, and, henderson, which, lie, about, halfway, between, the, marquesas, and, easter, it, has, been, observed, that, there, is, great, similarity, with, the, rapa, nui, language, and, early, mangarevan, similarities, between, a, statue, found, in, pitcairn, and, some, statues, found, in, easter, island, the, resemblance, of, tool, styles, in, easter, island, to, those, in, mangareva, and, pitcairn, and, correspondences, of, skulls, found, in, easter, island, to, two, skulls, found, in, henderson, all, suggesting, henderson, and, pitcairn, islands, to, have, been, early, stepping, stones, from, mangareva, to, easter, island, which, in, 1999, a, voyage, with, reconstructed, polynesian, boats, was, able, to, reach, easter, island, from, mangareva, after, a, seventeen, and, a, half, day, voyage, according, to, oral, traditions, recorded, by, missionaries, in, the, 1860s, the, island, originally, had, a, strong, class, system, an, ariki, or, high, chief, wielded, great, power, over, nine, other, clans, and, their, respective, chiefs, the, high, chief, was, the, eldest, descendant, through, first, born, lines, of, the, island, s, legendary, founder, hotu, matu, a, the, most, visible, element, in, the, culture, was, the, production, of, massive, moai, statues, that, some, believe, represented, deified, ancestors, according, to, national, geographic, most, scholars, suspect, that, the, moai, were, created, to, honor, ancestors, chiefs, or, other, important, personages, however, no, written, and, little, oral, history, exists, on, the, island, so, it, s, impossible, to, be, certain, it, was, believed, that, the, living, had, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, dead, in, which, the, dead, provided, everything, that, the, living, needed, health, fertility, of, land, and, animals, fortune, etc, and, the, living, through, offerings, provided, the, dead, with, a, better, place, in, the, spirit, world, most, settlements, were, located, on, the, coast, and, most, moai, were, erected, along, the, coastline, watching, over, their, descendants, in, the, settlements, before, them, with, their, backs, toward, the, spirit, world, in, the, sea, in, his, book, collapse, how, societies, choose, to, fail, or, succeed, jared, diamond, suggested, that, cannibalism, took, place, on, easter, island, after, the, construction, of, the, moai, contributed, to, environmental, degradation, when, extreme, deforestation, ecocide, destabilized, an, already, precarious, ecosystem, archeological, record, shows, that, at, the, time, of, the, initial, settlement, the, island, was, home, to, many, species, of, trees, including, at, least, three, species, which, grew, up, to, 15, metres, 49, ft, or, more, paschalococos, possibly, the, largest, palm, trees, in, the, world, at, the, time, alphitonia, zizyphoides, and, elaeocarpus, rarotongensis, at, least, six, species, of, land, birds, were, known, to, live, on, the, island, a, major, factor, that, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, multiple, plant, species, was, the, introduction, of, the, polynesian, rat, studies, by, paleobotanists, have, shown, rats, can, dramatically, affect, the, reproduction, of, vegetation, in, an, ecosystem, in, the, case, of, rapa, nui, recovered, plant, seed, shells, showed, markings, of, being, gnawed, on, by, rats, this, version, of, the, history, speculates, a, high, former, population, to, the, island, that, had, already, declined, before, europeans, arrived, barbara, a, west, wrote, sometime, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, on, easter, island, the, rapanui, experienced, a, tremendous, upheaval, in, their, social, system, brought, about, by, a, change, in, their, island, s, ecology, by, the, time, of, european, arrival, in, 1722, the, island, s, population, had, dropped, to, 2, 000, 3, 000, from, a, high, of, approximately, 15, 000, just, a, century, earlier, by, that, time, 21, species, of, trees, and, all, species, of, land, birds, became, extinct, through, some, combination, of, over, harvesting, over, hunting, rat, predation, and, climate, change, the, island, was, largely, deforested, and, it, did, not, have, any, trees, taller, than, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, loss, of, large, trees, meant, that, residents, were, no, longer, able, to, build, seaworthy, vessels, significantly, diminishing, their, fishing, abilities, according, to, this, version, of, the, history, the, trees, were, used, as, rollers, to, move, the, statues, to, their, place, of, erection, from, the, quarry, at, rano, raraku, deforestation, also, caused, erosion, which, caused, a, sharp, decline, in, agricultural, production, this, was, exacerbated, by, the, loss, of, land, birds, and, the, collapse, in, seabird, populations, as, a, source, of, food, by, the, 18th, century, islanders, were, largely, sustained, by, farming, with, domestic, chickens, as, the, primary, source, of, protein, as, the, island, became, overpopulated, and, resources, diminished, warriors, known, as, matatoa, gained, more, power, and, the, ancestor, cult, ended, making, way, for, the, bird, man, cult, beverly, haun, wrote, the, concept, of, mana, power, invested, in, hereditary, leaders, was, recast, into, the, person, of, the, birdman, apparently, beginning, circa, 1540, and, coinciding, with, the, final, vestiges, of, the, moai, period, this, cult, maintained, that, although, the, ancestors, still, provided, for, their, descendants, the, medium, through, which, the, living, could, contact, the, dead, was, no, longer, statues, but, human, beings, chosen, through, a, competition, the, god, responsible, for, creating, humans, makemake, played, an, important, role, in, this, process, katherine, routledge, who, systematically, collected, the, island, s, traditions, in, her, 1919, expedition, showed, that, the, competitions, for, bird, man, rapa, nui, tangata, manu, started, around, 1760, after, the, arrival, of, the, first, europeans, and, ended, in, 1878, with, the, construction, of, the, first, church, by, roman, catholic, missionaries, who, formally, arrived, in, 1864, petroglyphs, representing, bird, men, on, easter, island, are, the, same, as, some, in, hawaii, indicating, that, this, concept, was, probably, brought, by, the, original, settlers, only, the, competition, itself, was, unique, to, easter, island, according, to, diamond, and, heyerdahl, s, version, of, the, island, s, history, the, huri, mo, ai, statue, toppling, continued, into, the, 1830s, as, a, part, of, fierce, internal, wars, by, 1838, the, only, standing, moai, were, on, the, slopes, of, rano, raraku, in, hoa, hakananai, a, in, orongo, and, ariki, paro, in, ahu, te, pito, kura, diamond, and, west, s, version, of, the, history, is, highly, controversial, a, study, headed, by, douglas, owsley, published, in, 1994, asserted, that, there, is, little, archaeological, evidence, of, pre, european, societal, collapse, bone, pathology, and, osteometric, data, from, islanders, of, that, period, clearly, suggest, few, fatalities, can, be, attributed, directly, to, violence, research, by, binghamton, university, anthropologists, robert, dinapoli, and, carl, lipo, in, 2021, suggests, that, the, island, experienced, steady, population, growth, from, its, initial, settlement, until, european, contact, in, 1722, the, island, never, had, more, than, a, few, thousand, people, prior, to, european, contact, and, their, numbers, were, increasing, rather, than, dwindling, several, works, that, address, or, counter, diamond, s, claims, in, collapse, have, been, published, in, ecological, catastrophe, and, collapse, the, myth, of, ecocide, on, rapa, nui, easter, island, hunt, and, lipo, set, out, a, claim, by, claim, rebuttal, to, diamond, s, claims, this, includes, among, other, things, that, deforestation, began, immediately, but, the, population, grew, while, the, forest, declined, as, the, land, was, converted, to, more, productive, farmland, that, the, island, s, population, grew, continuously, up, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, with, the, only, clear, decline, starting, in, the, period, of, 1750, 1800, that, studies, from, other, islands, show, clearly, that, polynesian, settlement, without, polynesian, rats, is, only, associated, with, minimal, forest, loss, while, the, arrival, of, rats, without, human, settlement, is, devastating, to, forest, populations, only, species, favoured, by, the, rats, for, consumption, were, lost, not, for, example, the, native, sophora, toromiro, that, the, island, s, drier, less, predictable, climate, made, it, inherently, more, vulnerable, to, deforestation, than, other, polynesian, islands, and, that, the, population, declines, on, rapa, nui, can, be, well, attributed, to, the, very, mechanism, described, by, diamond, in, another, of, his, books, guns, germs, and, steel, the, devastating, impact, of, introduced, diseases, raids, slavery, and, exploitation, on, indigenous, populations, in, another, work, hunt, and, lipo, discuss, more, evidence, against, the, ecocide, hypothesis, in, addition, to, focusing, on, the, settlement, chronology, they, note, that, the, island, has, an, abnormally, low, amount, of, evidence, of, warfare, compared, to, other, polynesian, islands, only, relatively, small, scale, intergroup, conflict, there, are, no, fortifications, and, the, attributed, obsidian, mata, a, weapons, show, rather, evidence, of, having, been, used, in, agriculture, and, indeed, match, up, with, agricultural, tools, long, recognized, among, artifacts, of, other, polynesian, peoples, evidence, of, violence, among, skeletal, remains, of, pre, european, native, skeletons, is, minimal, with, only, 2, 5, of, crania, showing, evidence, of, antemortem, fractures, consistent, with, oswley, s, conclusions, most, skeletal, injuries, appear, to, have, been, nonlethal, few, fatalities, were, directly, attributable, to, violence, the, physical, evidence, suggests, that, the, frequency, of, warfare, and, lethal, events, was, exaggerated, in, folklore, despite, known, folklore, hunt, and, lipo, also, conclude, that, clear, evidence, of, cannibalism, among, skeletal, remains, is, entirely, lacking, they, note, that, in, the, search, for, evidence, supporting, ecocide, the, far, more, obvious, answer, has, long, been, known, and, cite, metraux, as, evidence, that, the, historic, slave, trading, epidemic, disease, intensive, sheep, ranching, and, tragic, population, collapse, indeed, the, genocide, of, the, rapanui, people, is, well, documented, and, has, been, recognized, for, a, long, time, they, conclude, that, when, it, comes, to, the, science, it, does, not, matter, whether, rapa, nui, offers, a, parable, for, today, s, urgent, environmental, problems, in, a, 2010, metastudy, on, the, state, of, the, evidence, the, mulrooney, et, al, concludes, that, to, date, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, for, the, proposed, precontact, collapse, of, rapa, nui, society, in, particular, the, authors, note, that, the, obsidian, usage, trends, lead, to, entirely, different, self, inconsistent, interpretations, while, use, of, the, oral, histories, of, widespread, intertribal, warfare, is, undercut, not, just, by, early, foreign, visitors, referring, to, the, people, as, peaceful, and, docile, but, the, fact, that, the, very, wars, in, question, were, referred, to, as, the, wars, of, the, throwing, down, of, the, statues, an, event, well, dated, to, not, have, begun, until, after, western, contact, the, first, recorded, european, contact, with, the, island, was, on, 5, april, 1722, easter, sunday, by, dutch, navigator, jacob, roggeveen, his, visit, resulted, in, the, death, of, about, a, dozen, islanders, including, the, tumu, ivi, atua, and, the, wounding, of, many, others, 46, 53, the, next, foreign, visitors, on, 15, november, 1770, were, two, spanish, ships, san, lorenzo, and, santa, rosalia, under, the, command, of, captain, don, felipe, gonzalez, de, ahedo, 238, 504, the, spanish, were, amazed, by, the, standing, idols, all, of, which, were, erect, at, the, time, 60, 64, in, 1776, the, chilean, priest, juan, ignacio, molina, highlights, the, island, for, its, monumental, statues, in, the, fifth, chapter, on, chilean, islands, of, his, book, natural, and, civil, history, of, the, kingdom, of, chile, four, years, later, in, 1774, british, explorer, james, cook, visited, easter, island, he, reported, that, some, statues, had, been, toppled, through, the, interpretation, of, hitihiti, cook, learned, the, statues, commemorated, their, former, high, chiefs, including, their, names, and, ranks, 296, 297, on, 10, april, 1786, french, admiral, jean, fran, ois, de, galaup, comte, de, lap, rouse, anchored, at, hanga, roa, at, the, start, of, a, circumnavigation, of, the, pacific, he, made, a, detailed, map, of, the, bay, including, his, anchorage, points, as, well, as, a, more, generalised, map, of, the, island, plus, some, illustrations, a, series, of, devastating, events, killed, or, removed, most, of, the, population, in, the, 1860s, in, december, 1862, peruvian, slave, raiders, struck, violent, abductions, continued, for, several, months, eventually, capturing, around, 1, 500, men, and, women, half, of, the, island, s, population, among, those, captured, were, the, island, s, paramount, chief, his, heir, and, those, who, knew, how, to, read, and, write, the, rongorongo, script, the, only, polynesian, script, to, have, been, found, to, date, although, debate, exists, about, whether, this, is, proto, writing, or, true, writing, when, the, slave, raiders, were, forced, to, repatriate, the, people, they, had, kidnapped, carriers, of, smallpox, disembarked, together, with, a, few, survivors, on, each, of, the, islands, this, created, devastating, epidemics, from, easter, island, to, the, marquesas, islands, easter, island, s, population, was, reduced, to, the, point, where, some, of, the, dead, were, not, even, buried, 91, the, first, christian, missionary, eug, ne, eyraud, arrived, in, january, 1864, and, spent, most, of, that, year, on, the, island, and, reported, for, the, first, time, the, existence, of, the, so, called, rongo,

rapa, nui, tradition, the, lands, could, not, be, sold, however, third, parties, believed, they, owned, them, and, they, were, bought, from, them, so, that, they, would, not, interfere, in, the, affairs, of, the, island, from, that, moment, on, at, that, time, the, rapa, nui, population, reached, alarming, numbers, in, a, census, carried, out, by, the, chilean, corvette, abtao, in, 1892,

gone, but, paleobotanical, studies, of, fossil, pollen, tree, moulds, left, by, lava, flows, and, root, casts, found, in, local, soils, indicate, that, the, island, was, formerly, forested, with, a, range, of, trees, shrubs, ferns, and, grasses, a, large, extinct, palm, paschalococos, disperta, related, to, the, chilean, wine, palm, jubaea, chilensis, was, one, of, the, dominant, trees, as, attested, by, fossil, evidence, like, its, chilean, counterpart, it, probably, took, close, to, 100, years, to, reach, adult, height, the, polynesian, rat, which, the, original, settlers, brought, with, them, played, a, very, important, role, in, the, disappearance, of, the, rapa, nui, palm, although, some, may, believe, that, rats, played, a, major, role, in, the, degradation, of, the, forest, less, than, 10, of, palm, nuts, show, teeth, marks, from, rats, the, remains, of, palm, stumps, in, different, places, indicate, that, humans, caused, the, trees, to, fall, because, in, large, areas, the, stumps, were, cut, efficiently, the, loss, the, palms, to, make, the, settlements, led, to, their, extinction, almost, 350, years, ago, the, toromiro, tree, sophora, toromiro, was, prehistorically, present, on, easter, island, but, is, now, extinct, in, the, wild, however, the, royal, botanic, gardens, kew, and, the, g, teborg, botanical, garden, are, jointly, leading, a, scientific, program, to, reintroduce, the, toromiro, to, easter, island, with, the, palm, and, the, toromiro, virtually, gone, there, was, considerably, less, rainfall, as, a, result, of, less, condensation, after, the, island, was, used, to, feed, thousands, of, sheep, for, almost, a, century, by, the, mid, 1900s, the, island, was, mostly, covered, in, grassland, with, nga, atu, or, bulrush, schoenoplectus, californicus, tatora, in, the, crater, lakes, of, rano, raraku, and, rano, kau, the, presence, of, these, reeds, which, are, called, totora, in, the, andes, was, used, to, support, the, argument, of, a, south, american, origin, of, the, statue, builders, but, pollen, analysis, of, lake, sediments, shows, these, reeds, have, grown, on, the, island, for, over, 30, 000, years, before, the, arrival, of, humans, easter, island, had, vast, seabird, colonies, containing, probably, over, 30, resident, species, perhaps, the, world, s, richest, such, colonies, are, no, longer, found, on, the, main, island, fossil, evidence, indicates, six, species, of, land, birds, two, rails, two, parrots, one, owl, and, one, heron, all, of, which, have, become, extinct, five, introduced, species, of, land, bird, are, known, to, have, breeding, populations, see, list, of, birds, of, easter, island, lack, of, studies, results, in, poor, understanding, of, the, oceanic, fauna, of, easter, island, and, waters, in, its, vicinity, however, possibilities, of, undiscovered, breeding, grounds, for, humpback, southern, blue, and, pygmy, blue, whales, including, easter, island, and, isla, salas, y, g, mez, have, been, considered, potential, breeding, areas, for, fin, whales, have, been, detected, off, northeast, of, the, island, as, well, the, immunosuppressant, drug, sirolimus, was, first, discovered, in, the, bacterium, streptomyces, hygroscopicus, in, a, soil, sample, from, easter, island, the, drug, is, also, known, as, rapamycin, after, rapa, nui, it, is, now, being, studied, for, extending, longevity, in, mice, trees, are, sparse, rarely, forming, natural, groves, and, it, has, been, argued, whether, native, easter, islanders, deforested, the, island, in, the, process, of, erecting, their, statues, and, in, providing, sustenance, for, an, overconsumption, of, natural, resources, from, a, overcrowded, island, experimental, archaeology, demonstrated, that, some, statues, certainly, could, have, been, placed, on, y, shaped, wooden, frames, called, miro, manga, erua, and, then, pulled, to, their, final, destinations, on, ceremonial, sites, other, theories, involve, the, use, of, ladders, parallel, wooden, rails, over, which, the, statues, could, have, been, dragged, rapa, nui, traditions, metaphorically, refer, to, spiritual, power, mana, as, the, means, by, which, the, moai, were, walked, from, the, quarry, recent, experimental, recreations, have, proven, that, it, is, fully, possible, that, the, moai, were, literally, walked, from, their, quarries, to, their, final, positions, by, use, of, ropes, casting, doubt, on, the, role, that, their, existence, plays, in, the, environmental, collapse, of, the, island, given, the, island, s, southern, latitude, the, climatic, effects, of, the, little, ice, age, about, 1650, to, 1850, may, have, exacerbated, deforestation, although, this, remains, speculative, many, researchers, point, to, the, climatic, downtrend, caused, by, the, little, ice, age, as, a, contributing, factor, to, resource, stress, and, to, the, palm, tree, s, disappearance, experts, however, do, not, agree, on, when, the, island, s, palms, became, extinct, jared, diamond, dismisses, past, climate, change, as, a, dominant, cause, of, the, island, s, deforestation, in, his, book, collapse, which, assesses, the, collapse, of, the, ancient, easter, islanders, influenced, by, heyerdahl, s, romantic, interpretation, of, easter, s, history, diamond, insists, that, the, disappearance, of, the, island, s, trees, seems, to, coincide, with, a, decline, of, its, civilization, around, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, alongside, declines, of, fish, bones, in, middens, suggesting, a, decline, in, fishing, and, then, declines, in, bird, bones, which, he, attributes, to, habitat, loss, he, notes, that, they, stopped, making, statues, at, that, time, and, started, destroying, the, ahu, but, the, link, is, weakened, because, the, bird, man, cult, continued, to, thrive, and, survived, the, great, impact, caused, by, the, arrival, of, explorers, whalers, sandalwood, traders, and, slave, raiders, benny, peiser, noted, evidence, of, self, sufficiency, when, europeans, first, arrived, the, island, still, had, smaller, trees, mainly, toromiro, which, became, extinct, in, the, wild, in, the, 20th, century, probably, because, of, slow, growth, and, changes, in, the, island, s, ecosystem, cornelis, bouman, jakob, roggeveen, s, captain, stated, in, his, logbook, of, yams, bananas, and, small, coconut, palms, we, saw, little, and, no, other, trees, or, crops, according, to, carl, friedrich, behrens, roggeveen, s, officer, the, natives, presented, palm, branches, as, peace, offerings, according, to, ethnographer, alfred, m, traux, the, most, common, type, of, house, was, called, hare, paenga, and, is, known, today, as, boathouse, because, the, roof, resembled, an, overturned, boat, the, foundations, of, the, houses, were, made, of, buried, basalt, slabs, with, holes, for, wooden, beams, to, connect, with, each, other, throughout, the, width, of, the, house, these, were, then, covered, with, a, layer, of, totora, reed, followed, by, a, layer, of, woven, sugarcane, leaves, and, lastly, a, layer, of, woven, grass, peiser, claims, that, these, reports, indicate, that, large, trees, existed, at, that, time, which, is, perhaps, contradicted, by, the, bouman, quote, above, plantations, were, often, located, farther, inland, next, to, foothills, inside, open, ceiling, lava, tubes, and, in, other, places, protected, from, the, strong, salt, winds, and, salt, spray, affecting, areas, closer, to, the, coast, it, is, possible, many, of, the, europeans, did, not, venture, inland, the, statue, quarry, only, one, kilometre, 5, 8, mile, from, the, coast, with, an, impressive, cliff, 100, m, 330, ft, high, was, not, explored, by, europeans, until, well, into, the, 19th, century, easter, island, has, suffered, from, heavy, soil, erosion, in, recent, centuries, aggravated, by, massive, historic, deforestation, alongside, modern, sheep, farming, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, jakob, roggeveen, reported, that, easter, island, was, exceptionally, fertile, fowls, are, the, only, animals, they, keep, they, cultivate, bananas, sugar, cane, and, above, all, sweet, potatoes, in, 1786, jean, fran, ois, de, la, p, rouse, visited, easter, island, and, his, gardener, declared, that, three, days, work, a, year, would, be, enough, to, support, the, population, rollin, a, major, in, the, p, rouse, expedition, wrote, instead, of, meeting, with, men, exhausted, by, famine, i, found, on, the, contrary, a, considerable, population, with, more, beauty, and, grace, than, i, afterwards, met, in, any, other, island, and, a, soil, which, with, very, little, labor, furnished, excellent, provisions, and, in, an, abundance, more, than, sufficient, for, the, consumption, of, the, inhabitants, the, islanders, innovation, of, lithic, mulching, the, practice, of, covering, fields, with, gravel, or, rocks, to, trap, moisture, and, improve, soil, fertility, is, a, well, known, and, effective, practice, in, dry, areas, of, the, premodern, world, according, to, diamond, the, oral, traditions, the, veracity, of, which, has, been, questioned, by, routledge, lavachery, m, traux, peiser, and, others, of, the, current, islanders, seem, obsessed, with, cannibalism, which, he, offers, as, evidence, supporting, a, rapid, collapse, for, example, he, states, to, severely, insult, an, enemy, one, would, say, the, flesh, of, your, mother, sticks, between, my, teeth, this, diamond, asserts, means, the, food, supply, of, the, people, ultimately, ran, out, cannibalism, however, was, widespread, across, polynesian, cultures, human, bones, have, not, been, found, in, earth, ovens, other, than, those, behind, the, religious, platforms, indicating, that, cannibalism, in, easter, island, was, a, ritualistic, practice, contemporary, ethnographic, research, has, proven, there, is, scarcely, any, tangible, evidence, for, widespread, cannibalism, anywhere, and, at, any, time, on, the, island, the, first, scientific, exploration, of, easter, island, 1914, recorded, that, the, indigenous, population, strongly, rejected, allegations, that, they, or, their, ancestors, had, been, cannibals, the, most, important, myths, are, the, rapa, nui, people, had, a, stone, age, culture, and, made, extensive, use, of, local, stone, the, large, stone, statues, or, moai, for, which, easter, island, is, famous, were, carved, in, the, period, 1100, 1680, ce, rectified, radio, carbon, dates, a, total, of, 887, monolithic, stone, statues, have, been, inventoried, on, the, island, and, in, museum, collections, although, often, identified, as, easter, island, heads, the, statues, have, torsos, most, of, them, ending, at, the, top, of, the, thighs, a, small, number, are, complete, figures, that, kneel, on, bent, knees, with, their, hands, over, their, stomachs, some, upright, moai, have, become, buried, up, to, their, necks, by, shifting, soils, almost, all, 95, moai, were, carved, from, compressed, easily, worked, solidified, volcanic, ash, or, tuff, found, at, a, single, site, on, the, side, of, the, extinct, volcano, rano, raraku, the, native, islanders, who, carved, them, used, only, stone, hand, chisels, mainly, basalt, toki, which, lie, in, place, all, over, the, quarry, the, stone, chisels, were, sharpened, by, chipping, off, a, new, edge, when, dulled, while, sculpting, was, going, on, the, volcanic, stone, was, splashed, with, water, to, soften, it, while, many, teams, worked, on, different, statues, at, the, same, time, a, single, moai, took, a, team, of, five, or, six, men, approximately, a, year, to, complete, each, statue, represented, the, deceased, head, of, a, lineage, only, a, quarter, of, the, statues, were, installed, nearly, half, remained, in, the, quarry, at, rano, raraku, and, the, rest, sat, elsewhere, presumably, on, their, way, to, intended, locations, the, largest, moai, raised, on, a, platform, is, known, as, paro, it, weighs, 82, tonnes, 90, short, tons, and, is, 9, 89, m, 32, ft, 5, in, long, several, other, statues, of, similar, weight, were, transported, to, ahu, on, the, north, and, south, coasts, possible, means, by, which, the, statues, were, moved, include, employment, of, a, miro, manga, erua, a, y, shaped, sledge, with, cross, pieces, pulled, with, ropes, made, from, the, tough, bark, of, the, hau, tree, and, tied, around, the, statue, s, neck, anywhere, from, 180, to, 250, men, were, required, for, pulling, depending, on, the, size, of, the, moai, among, other, researchers, on, moving, and, erecting, the, moai, was, vince, lee, who, reenacted, a, moai, moving, scenario, some, 50, of, the, statues, were, re, erected, in, modern, times, one, of, the, first, was, on, ahu, ature, huke, in, anakena, beach, in, 1956, it, was, raised, using, traditional, methods, during, a, heyerdahl, expedition, another, method, that, might, have, been, used, to, transport, the, moai, would, be, to, attach, ropes, to, the, statue, and, rock, it, tugging, it, forward, as, it, rocked, this, would, fit, the, legend, of, the, mo, ai, walking, to, their, final, locations, this, might, have, been, managed, by, as, few, as, 15, people, supported, by, the, following, evidence, there, is, debate, regarding, the, effects, of, the, monument, creation, process, on, the, environment, some, believe, that, the, process, of, creating, the, moai, caused, widespread, deforestation, and, ultimately, a, civil, war, over, scarce, resources, in, 2011, a, large, moai, statue, was, excavated, from, the, ground, during, the, same, excavation, program, some, larger, moai, were, found, to, have, complex, dorsal, petroglyphs, revealed, by, deep, excavation, of, the, torso, in, 2020, a, pickup, truck, crashed, into, and, destroyed, a, moai, statue, due, to, brake, failure, no, one, was, injured, in, the, incident, ahu, are, stone, platforms, varying, greatly, in, layout, many, were, reworked, during, or, after, the, huri, mo, ai, or, statue, toppling, era, many, became, ossuaries, one, was, dynamited, open, and, ahu, tongariki, was, swept, inland, by, a, tsunami, of, the, 313, known, ahu, 125, carried, moai, usually, just, one, probably, because, of, the, shortness, of, the, moai, period, and, transportation, difficulties, ahu, tongariki, one, km, 0, 62, mi, from, rano, raraku, had, the, most, and, tallest, moai, 15, in, total, other, notable, ahu, with, moai, are, ahu, akivi, restored, in, 1960, by, william, mulloy, nau, nau, at, anakena, and, tahai, some, moai, may, have, been, made, from, wood, and, were, lost, the, classic, elements, of, ahu, design, are, on, top, of, many, ahu, would, have, been, ahu, evolved, from, the, traditional, polynesian, marae, in, this, context, ahu, referred, to, a, small, structure, sometimes, covered, with, a, thatched, roof, where, sacred, objects, including, statues, were, stored, the, ahu, were, usually, adjacent, to, the, marae, or, main, central, court, where, ceremonies, took, place, though, on, easter, island, ahu, and, moai, evolved, to, much, greater, size, there, the, marae, is, the, unpaved, plaza, before, the, ahu, the, biggest, ahu, is, 220, m, 720, ft, and, holds, 15, statues, some, of, which, are, 9, m, 30, ft, high, the, filling, of, an, ahu, was, sourced, locally, apart, from, broken, old, moai, fragments, of, which, have, been, used, in, the, fill, individual, stones, are, mostly, far, smaller, than, the, moai, so, less, work, was, needed, to, transport, the, raw, material, but, artificially, leveling, the, terrain, for, the, plaza, and, filling, the, ahu, was, laborious, ahu, are, found, mostly, on, the, coast, where, they, are, distributed, densely, and, fairly, evenly, the, exceptions, are, the, western, slopes, of, mount, terevaka, and, the, rano, kau, and, poike, headlands, where, they, are, much, sparser, these, are, the, three, areas, with, the, least, low, lying, coastal, land, and, apart, from, poike, the, furthest, areas, from, rano, raraku, one, ahu, with, several, moai, was, recorded, on, the, cliffs, at, rano, kau, in, the, 1880s, but, had, fallen, to, the, beach, before, the, routledge, expedition, at, least, three, recorded, on, poike, in, the, 1930s, have, also, since, disappeared, one, of, the, highest, quality, examples, of, easter, island, stone, masonry, is, the, rear, wall, of, the, ahu, at, vinapu, made, without, mortar, by, shaping, hard, basalt, rocks, of, up, to, 7, 000, kg, 6, 9, long, tons, 7, 7, short, tons, to, match, each, other, exactly, it, has, a, superficial, similarity, to, some, inca, stone, walls, in, south, america, two, types, of, houses, are, known, from, the, past, hare, paenga, a, house, with, an, elliptical, foundation, made, with, basalt, slabs, and, covered, with, a, thatched, roof, that, resembled, an, overturned, boat, and, hare, oka, a, round, stone, structure, related, stone, structures, called, tupa, look, very, similar, to, the, hare, oka, except, that, the, tupa, were, inhabited, by, astronomer, priests, and, located, near, the, coast, where, the, movements, of, the, stars, could, be, easily, observed, settlements, also, contain, hare, moa, chicken, house, oblong, stone, structures, that, housed, chickens, the, houses, at, the, ceremonial, village, of, orongo, are, unique, in, that, they, are, shaped, like, hare, paenga, but, are, made, entirely, of, flat, basalt, slabs, found, inside, rano, kao, crater, the, entrances, to, all, the, houses, are, very, low, and, entry, requires, crawling, in, early, times, the, people, of, rapa, nui, reportedly, sent, the, dead, out, to, sea, in, small, funerary, canoes, as, did, their, polynesian, counterparts, on, other, islands, they, later, started, burying, people, in, secret, caves, to, save, the, bones, from, desecration, by, enemies, during, the, turmoil, of, the, late, 18th, century, the, islanders, seem, to, have, started, to, bury, their, dead, in, the, space, between, the, belly, of, a, fallen, moai, and, the, front, wall, of, the, structure, during, the, time, of, the, epidemics, they, made, mass, graves, that, were, semi, pyramidal, stone, structures, easter, island, has, one, of, the, richest, collections, of, petroglyphs, in, all, polynesia, around, 1, 000, sites, with, more, than, 4, 000, petroglyphs, are, catalogued, designs, and, images, were, carved, out, of, rock, for, a, variety, of, reasons, to, create, totems, to, mark, territory, or, to, memorialize, a, person, or, event, there, are, distinct, variations, around, the, island, in, the, frequency, of, themes, among, petroglyphs, with, a, concentration, of, birdmen, at, orongo, other, subjects, include, sea, turtles, komari, vulvas, and, makemake, the, chief, god, of, the, tangata, manu, or, birdman, cult, the, island, and, neighbouring, motu, nui, are, riddled, with, caves, many, of, which, show, signs, of, past, human, use, for, planting, and, as, fortifications, including, narrowed, entrances, and, crawl, spaces, with, ambush, points, many, caves, feature, in, the, myths, and, legends, of, the, rapa, nui, the, pu, o, hiro, trumpet, of, hiro, is, a, 1, 25, metres, 4, ft, 1, in, high, ancient, stone, aerophone, on, the, north, coast, of, easter, island, it, was, once, used, by, the, rapa, nui, as, a, musical, instrument, in, fertility, rituals, the, stone, is, covered, in, petroglyphs, called, komari, which, represent, fertility, by, skillfully, blowing, wind, in, the, top, hole, it, makes, a, deep, trumpeting, sound, to, invoke, the, god, of, rain, hiro, in, polynesian, mythology, easter, island, once, had, an, apparent, script, called, rongorongo, glyphs, include, pictographic, and, geometric, shapes, the, texts, were, incised, in, wood, in, reverse, boustrophedon, direction, it, was, first, reported, by, french, missionary, eug, ne, eyraud, in, 1864, at, that, time, several, islanders, said, they, could, understand, the, writing, but, according, to, tradition, only, ruling, families, and, priests, were, ever, literate, and, none, survived, the, slave, raids, and, subsequent, epidemics, despite, numerous, attempts, the, surviving, texts, have, not, been, deciphered, and, without, decipherment, it, is, not, certain, that, they, are, actually, writing, part, of, the, problem, is, the, small, amount, that, has, survived, only, two, dozen, texts, none, of, which, remain, on, the, island, there, are, also, only, a, couple, of, similarities, with, the, petroglyphs, on, the, island, wood, was, scarce, on, easter, island, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, but, a, number, of, highly, detailed, and, distinctive, carvings, have, found, their, way, to, the, world, s, museums, particular, forms, include, the, rapanui, sponsor, an, annual, festival, the, tapati, held, since, 1975, around, the, beginning, of, february, to, celebrate, rapa, nui, culture, the, islanders, also, maintain, a, national, football, team, and, three, discos, in, the, town, of, hanga, roa, other, cultural, activities, include, a, musical, tradition, that, combines, south, american, and, polynesian, influences, and, woodcarving, the, chilean, leg, of, the, red, bull, cliff, diving, world, series, takes, place, on, the, island, of, rapa, nui, tapati, rapa, nui, festival, week, festival, in, the, local, language, is, an, annual, two, week, long, festival, celebrating, easter, island, culture, the, tapati, is, centered, around, a, competition, between, two, families, clans, competing, in, various, competitions, to, earn, points, the, winning, team, has, their, candidate, crowned, queen, of, the, island, for, the, next, year, the, competitions, are, a, way, to, maintain, and, celebrate, traditional, cultural, activities, such, as, cooking, jewelry, making, woodcarving, and, canoeing, population, at, the, 2012, census, was, 5, 761, increased, from, 3, 791, in, 2002, in, 2002, 60, were, persons, of, indigenous, rapa, nui, origin, 39, were, mainland, chileans, or, their, easter, island, born, descendants, of, european, mostly, spanish, or, mestizo, mixed, european, and, indigenous, chilean, amerindian, origin, and, easter, island, born, mestizos, of, european, and, rapa, nui, and, or, native, chilean, descent, and, the, remaining, 1, were, indigenous, mainland, chilean, amerindians, or, their, easter, island, born, descendants, as, of, 2012, the, population, density, on, easter, island, was, 35, km, 2, 91, sq, mi, the, 1982, population, was, 1, 936, the, increase, in, population, in, the, last, census, was, partly, caused, by, the, arrival, of, people, of, european, or, mixed, european, and, native, american, descent, from, the, chilean, mainland, however, most, married, a, rapa, nui, spouse, around, 70, of, the, population, were, natives, estimates, of, the, pre, european, population, range, from, 7, 17, 000, easter, island, s, all, time, low, of, 111, inhabitants, was, reported, in, 1877, out, of, these, 111, rapa, nui, only, 36, had, descendants, and, all, of, today, s, rapa, nui, claim, descent, from, those, 36, easter, island, s, traditional, language, is, rapa, nui, an, eastern, polynesian, language, sharing, some, similarities, with, hawaiian, and, tahitian, however, as, in, the, rest, of, mainland, chile, the, official, language, used, is, spanish, easter, island, is, the, only, territory, in, polynesia, where, spanish, is, an, official, language, it, is, supposed, that, the, 2, 700, indigenous, rapa, nui, living, in, the, island, have, a, certain, degree, of, knowledge, of, their, traditional, language, however, census, data, does, not, exist, on, the, primary, known, and, spoken, languages, among, easter, island, s, inhabitants, and, there, are, recent, claims, that, the, number, of, fluent, speakers, is, as, low, as, 800, indeed, rapa, nui, has, been, declining, in, its, number, of, speakers, as, the, island, undergoes, hispanicization, because, the, island, is, under, the, jurisdiction, of, chile, and, is, now, home, to, a, number, of, chilean, continentals, most, of, whom, speak, only, spanish, for, this, reason, most, rapa, nui, children, now, grow, up, speaking, spanish, and, those, who, do, learn, rapa, nui, begin, learning, it, later, in, life, even, with, efforts, to, revitalize, the, language, ethnologue, has, established, that, rapa, nui, is, currently, a, threatened, language, easter, island, s, indigenous, rapa, nui, toponymy, has, survived,
