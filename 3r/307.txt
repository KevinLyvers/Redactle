years, ago, much, of, the, island, is, composed, of, jurassic, dolerite, intrusions, the, upwelling, of, magma, through, other, rock, types, sometimes, forming, large, columnar, joints, tasmania, has, the, world, s, largest, areas, of, dolerite, with, many, distinctive, mountains, and, cliffs, formed, from, this, rock, type, the, central, plateau, and, the, southeast, portions, of, the, island,

different, blackmans, bay, and, the, following, year, tobias, furneaux, became, the, first, englishman, to, land, in, tasmania, when, he, arrived, at, adventure, bay, which, he, named, after, his, ship, hms, adventure, captain, james, cook, also, landed, at, adventure, bay, in, 1777, matthew, flinders, and, george, bass, sailed, through, bass, strait, in, 1798, 1799, determining, for, the, first, time, that, tasmania, was, an, island, sealers, and, whalers, based, themselves, on, tasmania, s, islands, from, 1798, and, in, august, 1803, new, south, wales, governor, philip, king, sent, lieutenant, john, bowen, to, establish, a, small, military, outpost, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, derwent, river, in, order, to, forestall, any, claims, to, the, island, by, french, explorers, who, had, been, exploring, the, southern, australian, coastline, bowen, who, led, a, party, of, 49, including, 21, male, and, three, female, convicts, named, the, camp, risdon, several, months, later, a, second, settlement, was, established, by, captain, david, collins, with, 308, convicts, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, miles, to, the, south, in, sullivans, cove, on, the, western, side, of, the, derwent, where, fresh, water, was, more, plentiful, the, latter, settlement, became, known, as, hobart, town, or, hobarton, later, shortened, to, hobart, after, the, british, colonial, secretary, of, the, time, lord, hobart, the, settlement, at, risdon, was, later, abandoned, left, on, their, own, without, further, supplies, the, sullivans, cove, settlement, suffered, severe, food, shortages, and, by, 1806, its, inhabitants, were, starving, with, many, resorting, to, scraping, seaweed, off, rocks, and, scavenging, washed, up, whale, blubber, from, the, shore, to, survive, a, smaller, colony, was, established, at, port, dalrymple, on, the, tamar, river, in, the, island, s, north, in, october, 1804, and, several, other, convict, based, settlements, were, established, including, the, particularly, harsh, penal, colonies, at, port, arthur, in, the, southeast, and, macquarie, harbour, on, the, west, coast, tasmania, was, eventually, sent, 75, 000, convicts, four, out, of, every, ten, people, transported, to, australia, by, 1819, the, aboriginal, and, british, population, reached, parity, with, about, 5000, of, each, although, among, the, colonists, men, outnumbered, women, four, to, one, free, settlers, began, arriving, in, large, numbers, from, 1820, lured, by, the, promise, of, land, grants, and, free, convict, labour, settlement, in, the, island, s, northwest, corner, was, monopolised, by, the, van, diemen, s, land, company, which, sent, its, first, surveyors, to, the, district, in, 1826, by, 1830, one, third, of, australia, s, non, indigenous, population, lived, in, van, diemen, s, land, and, the, island, accounted, for, about, half, of, all, land, under, cultivation, and, exports, tensions, between, tasmania, s, aboriginal, and, white, inhabitants, rose, partly, driven, by, increasing, competition, for, kangaroo, and, other, game, explorer, and, naval, officer, john, oxley, in, 1810, noted, the, many, atrocious, cruelties, inflicted, on, aboriginal, people, by, convict, bushrangers, in, the, north, which, in, turn, led, to, black, attacks, on, solitary, white, hunters, hostilities, increased, further, with, the, arrival, of, 600, colonists, from, norfolk, island, between, 1807, and, 1813, they, established, farms, along, the, river, derwent, and, east, and, west, of, launceston, occupying, ten, percent, of, van, diemen, s, land, by, 1824, the, colonial, population, had, swelled, to, 12, 600, while, the, island, s, sheep, population, had, reached, 200, 000, the, rapid, colonisation, transformed, traditional, kangaroo, hunting, grounds, into, farms, with, grazing, livestock, as, well, as, fences, hedges, and, stone, walls, while, police, and, military, patrols, were, increased, to, control, the, convict, farm, labourers, violence, began, to, spiral, rapidly, from, the, mid, 1820s, in, what, became, described, as, the, black, war, aboriginal, inhabitants, were, driven, to, desperation, by, hunger, that, included, a, desire, for, agricultural, produce, as, well, as, feeling, anger, at, the, prevalence, of, abductions, of, women, and, girls, new, settlers, motivated, by, fear, carried, out, self, defence, operations, as, well, as, attacks, as, a, means, of, suppressing, the, native, threat, or, even, in, some, cases, exacting, revenge, van, diemen, s, land, had, an, enormous, gender, imbalance, with, male, colonists, outnumbering, females, six, to, one, in, 1822, and, 16, to, one, among, the, convict, population, historian, nicholas, clements, has, suggested, the, voracious, appetite, for, native, women, was, the, most, important, trigger, for, the, explosion, of, violence, from, the, late, 1820s, from, 1825, to, 1828, the, number, of, native, attacks, more, than, doubled, each, year, raising, panic, among, settlers, over, the, summer, of, 1826, 1827, clans, from, the, big, river, oyster, bay, and, north, midlands, nations, speared, stock, keepers, on, farms, and, made, it, clear, that, they, wanted, the, settlers, and, their, sheep, and, cattle, to, move, from, their, kangaroo, hunting, grounds, settlers, responded, vigorously, resulting, in, many, mass, killings, in, november, 1826, governor, sir, george, arthur, issued, a, government, notice, declaring, that, colonists, were, free, to, kill, aboriginal, people, when, they, attacked, settlers, or, their, property, and, in, the, following, eight, months, more, than, 200, aboriginal, people, were, killed, in, the, settled, districts, in, reprisal, for, the, deaths, of, 15, colonists, after, another, eight, months, the, death, toll, had, risen, to, 43, colonists, and, probably, 350, aboriginal, people, in, april, 1828, arthur, issued, a, proclamation, of, demarcation, forbidding, aboriginal, people, to, enter, the, settled, districts, without, a, passport, issued, by, the, government, arthur, declared, martial, law, in, the, colony, in, november, that, year, and, this, remained, in, force, for, over, three, years, the, longest, period, of, martial, law, in, australian, history, in, november, 1830, arthur, organised, the, so, called, black, line, ordering, every, able, bodied, male, colonist, to, assemble, at, one, of, seven, designated, places, in, the, settled, districts, to, join, a, massive, drive, to, sweep, aboriginal, people, out, of, the, region, and, on, to, the, tasman, peninsula, the, campaign, failed, and, was, abandoned, seven, weeks, later, but, by, then, tasmania, s, aboriginal, population, had, fallen, to, about, 300, after, hostilities, between, settlers, and, aboriginal, peoples, ceased, in, 1832, almost, all, of, the, remnants, of, the, indigenous, population, were, persuaded, by, government, agent, george, augustus, robinson, to, move, to, flinders, island, many, quickly, succumbed, to, infectious, diseases, to, which, they, had, no, immunity, reducing, the, population, further, of, those, removed, from, tasmania, the, last, to, die, was, truganini, in, 1876, the, near, destruction, of, tasmania, s, aboriginal, population, has, been, described, as, an, act, of, genocide, by, historians, including, robert, hughes, james, boyce, lyndall, ryan, and, tom, lawson, however, other, historians, including, henry, reynolds, richard, broome, and, nicholas, clements, do, not, agree, with, the, genocide, thesis, arguing, that, the, colonial, authorities, did, not, intend, to, destroy, the, aboriginal, population, in, whole, or, in, part, boyce, has, claimed, that, the, april, 1828, proclamation, separating, the, aborigines, from, the, white, inhabitants, sanctioned, force, against, aboriginal, people, for, no, other, reason, than, that, they, were, aboriginal, however, as, reynolds, broome, and, clements, point, out, there, was, open, warfare, at, the, time, boyce, described, the, decision, to, remove, all, tasmanian, aboriginal, people, after, 1832, by, which, time, they, had, given, up, their, fight, against, white, colonists, as, an, extreme, policy, position, he, concluded, the, colonial, government, from, 1832, to, 1838, ethnically, cleansed, the, western, half, of, van, diemen, s, land, nevertheless, clements, and, flood, note, that, there, was, another, wave, of, violence, in, north, west, tasmania, in, 1841, involving, attacks, on, settlers, huts, by, a, band, of, aboriginal, tasmanians, who, had, not, been, removed, from, the, island, van, diemen, s, land, which, thus, far, had, existed, as, a, territory, within, the, colony, of, new, south, wales, was, proclaimed, a, separate, colony, with, its, own, judicial, establishment, and, legislative, council, on, 3, december, 1825, transportation, to, the, island, ceased, in, 1853, and, the, colony, was, renamed, tasmania, in, 1856, partly, to, differentiate, the, burgeoning, society, of, free, settlers, from, the, island, s, convict, past, the, legislative, council, of, van, diemen, s, land, drafted, a, new, constitution, which, gained, royal, assent, in, 1855, the, privy, council, also, approved, the, colony, changing, its, name, from, van, diemen, s, land, to, tasmania, and, in, 1856, the, newly, elected, bicameral, parliament, sat, for, the, first, time, establishing, tasmania, as, a, self, governing, colony, of, the, british, empire, the, colony, suffered, from, economic, fluctuations, but, for, the, most, part, was, prosperous, experiencing, steady, growth, with, few, external, threats, and, strong, trade, links, with, the, empire, tasmania, enjoyed, many, fruitful, periods, in, the, late, 19th, century, becoming, a, world, centre, of, shipbuilding, it, raised, a, local, defence, force, that, eventually, played, a, significant, role, in, the, second, boer, war, in, south, africa, and,

diemen, s, land, bass, s, straits, later, it, became, known, as, bass, strait, the, existence, of, the, strait, had, been, suggested, in, 1797, by, the, master, of, sydney, cove, when, he, reached, sydney, after, deliberately, grounding, his, foundering, ship, and, being, stranded, on, preservation, island, at, the, eastern, end, of, the, strait, he, reported, that, the, strong, south, westerly, swell, and, the, tides, and, currents, suggested, that, the, island, was, in, a, channel, linking, the, pacific, and, southern, indian, ocean, governor, hunter, thus, wrote, to, joseph, banks, in, august, 1797, that, it, seemed, certain, a, strait, existed, tasmania, has, a, relatively, cool, temperate, climate, compared, to, the, rest, of, australia, spared, from, the, hot, summers, of, the,

the, world, tasmania, is, considered, as, the, opposite, side, of, the, planet, to, most, places, and, supposedly, home, to, mythically, exotic, animals, such, as, the, tasmanian, devil, as, popularised, by, warner, brothers, tasmania, has, a, reputation, within, australia, that, is, often, at, odds, with, the, reality, of, the, state, or, may, have, only, been, true, during, colonial, times, and, has, only, persevered, on, the, australian, mainland, as, a, myth, because, of, these, stereotypes, tasmania, is, often, referred, to, as, the, primary, target, i, e, butt, of, mainland, australian, jokes, in, more, recent, times, references, to, insults, against, tasmania, are, more, sarcastic, and, jovial, but, angst, against, the, island, still, exists, the, most, commonly, cited, sarcastic, comment, is, on, the, supposedly, two, headed, tasmanians, which, originated, due, to, some, colonists, developing, goitres, from, the, low, amount, of, iodine, in, the, island, s, soil, but, as, tasmania, receives, higher, volumes, of, inter, state, tourists, the, perceptions, are, in, the, process, of, changing, the, most, prominent, example, of, negative, stereotype, is, of, inbreeding, due, to, the, relatively, small, size, of, tasmania, compared, to, the, rest, of, australia, though, tasmania, is, nearly, as, large, as, the, republic, of, ireland, in, area, and, more, populous, than, iceland, this, is, untrue, and, if, it, had, once, been, the, case, it, would, have, existed, in, the, rest, of, colonial, australia, as, well, though, tasmania, s, penal, establishments, were, some, of, the, harshest, in, the, entire, colony, and, home, to, infamous, bushrangers, this, is, a, part, of, the, also, receding, global, stereotype, that, all, australians, are, or, were, derived, from, criminals, even, as, most, convicts, were, transported, for, petty, crimes, during, this, period, of, european, settlement, tasmania, was, the, second, centre, of, power, and, a, significant, port, of, the, british, empire, on, the, continent, after, new, south, wales, before, being, surpassed, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, by, victoria, and, regions, sustained, by, mining, booms, following, the, cessation, of, transportation, in, 1853, a, mentality, developed, in, certain, corners, of, australia, and, led, to, a, general, dislike, of, tasmania, amongst, these, people, even, if, the, opinion, holder, had, never, properly, visited, it, can, rise, to, such, an, extent, as, to, argue, for, the, secession, of, tasmania, from, the, rest, of,
