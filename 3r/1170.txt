the, name, bras, lia, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, the, federal, district, as, a, whole, which, is, divided, into, 35, administrative, regions, one, of, which, plano, piloto, includes, the, area, of, the, originally, planned, city, and, its, federal, government, buildings, the, entire, federal, district, is, considered, by, ibge, to, make, up, bras, lia, s, city, area, and, the, local, government, considers, the, entirety, of, the, district, plus, 12, neighboring, municipalities, in, the, state, of, goi, s, to, be, its, metropolitan, area, the, term, bras, lia, comes, from, the, latin, translation, of, brazil, which, was, suggested, as, a, name, for, the, country, s, capital, in, 1821, by, jos, bonif, cio, de, andrada, e, silva, brazil, s, first, capital, was, salvador, in,

country, s, population, was, concentrated, near, its, atlantic, coast, brasilia, s, geographically, central, location, fostered, a, more, regionally, neutral, federal, capital, an, article, of, the, country, s, first, republican, constitution, dated, 1891, states, that, the, capital, should, be, moved, from, rio, de, janeiro, to, a, place, close, to, the, country, s, center, the, idea, of, relocating, brazil, s, capital, city, was, conceived, in, 1827, by, jos, bonif, cio, an, advisor, to, emperor, pedro, i, he, presented, a, plan, to, the, general, assembly, of, brazil, for, a, new, city, called, brasilia, with, the, idea, of, moving, the, capital, westward, from, the, heavily, populated, southeastern, corridor, the, bill, was, not, enacted, because, pedro, i, dissolved, the, assembly, according, to, a, legend, italian, saint, don, bosco, in, 1883, had, a, dream, in, which, he, described, a, futuristic, city, that, roughly, fitted, brasilia, s, location, in, brasilia, today, many, references, to, bosco, who, founded, the, salesian, order, are, found, throughout, the, city, and, one, church, parish, in, the, city, bears, his, name, juscelino, kubitschek, was, elected, president, of, brazil, in, 1955, upon, taking, office, in, january, 1956, in, fulfilment, of, his, campaign, pledge, he, initiated, the, planning, and, construction, of, the, new, capital, the, following, year, an, international, jury, selected, l, cio, costa, s, plan, to, guide, the, construction, of, brazil, s, new, capital, brasilia, costa, was, a, student, of, the, famous, modernist, architect, le, corbusier, and, some, of, modernism, s, architecture, features, can, be, found, in, his, plan, costa, s, plan, was, not, as, detailed, as, some, of, the, plans, presented, by, other, architects, and, city, planners, it, did, not, include, land, use, schedules, models, population, charts, or, mechanical, drawings, however, it, was, chosen, by, five, out, of, six, jurors, because, it, had, the, features, required, to, align, the, growth, of, a, capital, city, even, though, the, initial, plan, was, transformed, over, time, it, oriented, much, of, the, construction, and, most, of, its, features, survived, brasilia, s, accession, as, the, new, capital, and, its, designation, for, the, development, of, an, extensive, interior, region, inspired, the, symbolism, of, the, plan, costa, used, a, cross, axial, design, indicating, the, possession, and, conquest, of, this, new, place, with, a, cross, often, likened, to, a, dragonfly, an, airplane, or, a, bird, costa, s, plan, included, two, principal, components, the, monumental, axis, east, to, west, and, the, residential, axis, north, to, south, the, monumental, axis, was, assigned, political, and, administrative, activities, and, is, considered, the, body, of, the, city, with, the, style, and, simplicity, of, its, buildings, oversized, scales, and, broad, vistas, and, heights, producing, the, idea, of, monumentality, this, axis, includes, the, various, ministries, national, congress, presidential, palace, supreme, court, building, and, the, television, and, radio, tower, the, residential, axis, was, intended, to, contain, areas, with, intimate, character, and, is, considered, the, most, important, achievement, of, the, plan, it, was, designed, for, housing, and, associated, functions, such, as, local, commerce, schooling, recreation, and, churches, constituted, of, 96, superblocks, limited, to, six, story, buildings, and, 12, additional, superblocks, limited, to, three, story, buildings, costa, s, intention, with, superblocks, was, to, have, small, self, contained, and, self, sufficient, neighborhoods, and, uniform, buildings, with, apartments, of, two, or, three, different, categories, where, he, envisioned, the, integration, of, upper, and, middle, classes, sharing, the, same, residential, area, the, urban, design, of, the, communal, apartment, blocks, was, based, on, le, corbusier, s, ville, radieuse, of, 1935, and, the, superblocks, on, the, north, american, radburn, layout, from, 1929, visually, the, blocks, were, intended, to, appear, absorbed, by, the, landscape, because, they, were, isolated, by, a, belt, of, tall, trees, and, lower, vegetation, costa, attempted, to, introduce, a, brazil, that, was, more, equitable, he, also, designed, housing, for, the, working, classes, that, was, separated, from, the, upper, and, middle, class, housing, and, was, visually, different, with, the, intention, of, avoiding, slums, favelas, in, the, urban, periphery, the, superquadra, has, been, accused, of, being, a, space, where, individuals, are, oppressed, and, alienated, to, a, form, of, spatial, segregation, one, of, the, main, objectives, of, the, plan, was, to, allow, the, free, flow, of, automobile, traffic, the, plan, included, lanes, of, traffic, in, a, north, south, direction, seven, for, each, direction, for, the, monumental, axis, and, three, arterials, the, w3, the, eixo, and, the, l2, for, the, residential, axis, the, cul, de, sac, access, roads, of, the, superblocks, were, planned, to, be, the, end, of, the, main, flow, of, traffic, and, the, reason, behind, the, heavy, emphasis, on, automobile, traffic, is, the, architect, s, desire, to, establish, the, concept, of, modernity, in, every, level, though, automobiles, were, invented, prior, to, the, 20th, century, mass, production, of, vehicles, in, the, early, 20th, made, them, widely, available, thus, they, became, a, symbol, of, modernity, the, two, small, axes, around, the, monumental, axis, provide, loops, and, exits, for, cars, to, enter, small, roads, some, argue, that, his, emphasis, of, the, plan, on, automobiles, caused, the, lengthening, of, distances, between, centers, and, it, attended, only, the, necessities, of, a, small, segment, of, the, population, who, owned, cars, but, one, can, not, ignore, the, bus, transportation, system, in, the, city, the, buses, routes, inside, the, city, operate, heavily, on, w3, and, l2, almost, anywhere, including, satellite, cities, can, be, reached, just, by, taking, the, bus, and, most, of, the, plano, piloto, can, be, reached, without, transferring, to, other, buses, later, as, the, population, of, the, city, increased, the, transportation, system, also, played, an, important, role, in, mediating, the, relationship, between, the, pilot, plan, and, the, satellite, cities, due, to, the, larger, influx, of, vehicles, traffic, lights, were, introduced, to, the, monumental, axis, which, violates, the, concept, of, modernity, and, advancement, the, architect, first, employed, additionally, the, metro, system, in, brasilia, was, mainly, built, for, inhabitants, of, satellite, cities, though, this, growth, has, made, brasilia, no, longer, a, pure, utopia, with, incomparable, modernity, the, later, development, of, traffic, management, bus, routes, to, satellite, cities, and, the, metro, system, all, serve, as, a, remedy, to, the, dystopia, enabling, the, citizens, to, enjoy, the, kind, of, modernity, that, was, not, carefully, planned, at, the, intersection, of, the, monumental, and, residential, axis, costa, planned, the, city, center, with, the, transportation, center, rodoviaria, the, banking, sector, and, the, hotel, sector, near, to, the, city, center, he, proposed, an, amusement, center, with, theaters, cinemas, and, restaurants, costa, s, plan, is, seen, as, a, plan, with, a, sectoral, tendency, segregating, all, the, banks, the, office, buildings, and, the, amusement, center, one, of, the, main, features, of, costa, s, plan, was, that, he, presented, a, new, city, with, its, future, shape, and, patterns, evident, from, the, beginning, this, meant, that, the, original, plan, included, paving, streets, that, were, not, immediately, put, into, use, the, advantage, of, this, was, that, the, original, plan, is, hard, to, undo, because, he, provided, for, an, entire, street, network, but, on, the, other, hand, is, difficult, to, adapt, and, mold, to, other, circumstances, in, the, future, in, addition, there, has, been, controversy, with, the, monumental, aspect, of, l, cio, costa, s, plan, because, it, appeared, to, some, as, 19th, century, city, planning, not, modern, 20th, century, in, urbanism, an, interesting, analysis, can, be, made, of, brasilia, within, the, context, of, cold, war, politics, and, the, association, of, l, cio, costa, s, plan, to, the, symbolism, of, aviation, from, an, architectural, perspective, the, airplane, shaped, plan, was, certainly, an, homage, to, le, corbusier, and, his, enchantment, with, the, aircraft, as, an, architectural, masterpiece, however, brasilia, was, constructed, soon, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, despite, brazil, s, minor, participation, in, the, conflict, the, airplane, shape, of, the, city, was, key, in, envisioning, the, country, as, part, of, the, newly, globalized, world, together, with, the, victorious, allies, furthermore, brasilia, is, a, unique, example, of, modernism, both, as, a, guideline, for, architectural, design, but, also, as, a, principle, for, organizing, society, modernism, in, brasilia, is, explored, in, james, holston, s, book, the, modernist, city, juscelino, kubitschek, president, of, brazil, from, 1956, to, 1961, ordered, brasilia, s, construction, fulfilling, the, promise, of, the, constitution, and, his, own, political, campaign, promise, building, brasilia, was, part, of, juscelino, s, fifty, years, of, prosperity, in, five, plan, already, in, 1892, the, astronomer, louis, cruls, in, the, service, of, the, brazilian, government, had, investigated, the, site, for, the, future, capital, l, cio, costa, won, a, contest, and, was, the, main, urban, planner, in, 1957, with, 5550, people, competing, oscar, niemeyer, was, the, chief, architect, of, most, public, buildings, joaquim, cardozo, was, the, structural, engineer, and, roberto, burle, marx, was, the, landscape, designer, brasilia, was, built, in, 41, months, from, 1956, to, 21, april, 1960, when, it, was, officially, inaugurated, the,
