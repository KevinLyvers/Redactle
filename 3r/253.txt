virtually, destroying, it, and, further, cementing, british, preeminence, in, the, region, in, 1674, the, dutch, attempted, to, conquer, the, island, but, were, repulsed, because, there, were, few, catholic, priests, in, the, french, antilles, many, of, the, earliest, french, settlers, were, huguenots, who, sought, religious, freedom, others, were, transported, there, as, a, punishment, for, refusing, to, convert, to, catholicism, many, of, them, dying, en, route, those, who, survived, were, quite, industrious, and, over, time, prospered, though, the, less, fortunate, were, reduced, to, the, status, of, indentured, servants, although, edicts, from, king, louis, xiv, s, court, regularly, came, to, the, islands, to, suppress, the, protestant, heretics, these, were, mostly, ignored, by, island, authorities, until, louis, xiv, s, edict, of, revocation, in, 1685, as, many, of, the, planters, on, martinique, were, huguenots, suffering, under, the, harsh, strictures, of, the, revocation, they, began, plotting, to, emigrate, from, martinique, with, many, of, their, recently, arrived, brethren, many, of, them, were, encouraged, by, the, catholics, who, looked, forward, to, their, departure, and, the, opportunities, for, seizing, their, property, by, 1688, nearly, all, of, martinique, s, french, protestant, population, had, escaped, to, the, british, american, colonies, or, protestant, countries, in, europe, the, policy, decimated, the, population, of, martinique, and, the, rest, of, the, french, antilles, and, set, back, their, colonisation, by, decades, causing, the, french, king, to, relax, his, policies, in, the, region, which, left, the, islands, susceptible, to, british, occupation, over, the, next, century, under, governor, of, the, antilles, charles, de,

have, specific, legislation, on, electricity, production, and, distribution, martinique, s, energy, mix, is, marked, by, a, very, strong, importance, of, thermal, energy, production, at, the, same, time, the, island, s, electricity, consumption, has, decreased, slightly, these, results, can, be, attributed, to, the, information, and, awareness, raising, efforts, of, the, regions, the, agency, for, the, environment, and, energy, management, ademe, and, energy, companies, in, favor, of, energy, savings, but, also, to, the, context, of, demographic, decline, of, the, territory, despite, these, results, the, control, of, the, territory, s, electricity, consumption, remains, a, central, issue, given, the, territory, s, low, energy, potential, compared, to, other, overseas, territories, such, as, guadeloupe, and, reunion, martinique, and, its, inhabitants, are, therefore, faced, with, a, twofold, need, to, further, strengthen, the, control, of, electricity, consumption, and, at, the, same, time, develop, renewable, energies, to, reduce, environmental, pollution, due, to, thermal, electricity, production, the, exploitation, of, renewable, energies, in, martinique, started, late, as, the, characteristics, of, the, island, were, previously, considered, unfavorable, for, their, development, however, the, efforts, of, the, population, and, energy, suppliers, are, moving, towards,

energy, autonomy, is, planned, for, 2030, as, martinique, s, electricity, distribution, grid, is, not, interconnected, with, neighboring, islands, let, alone, with, the, mainland, s, metropolitan, grid, the, decree, of, 23, april, 2008, applies, to, the, management, of, so, called, intermittent, energies, wind, photovoltaic, and, marine, any, solar, and, wind, power, production, facility, with, a, capacity, exceeding, 3, kwp, and, not, equipped, with, a, storage, system, is, liable, to, be, disconnected, from, the, grid, by, the, grid, manager, once, the, threshold, of, 30, of, random, active, power, injected, into, the, grid, has, been, reached, thus, the, achievement, of, the, objectives, of, the, grenelle, i, law, is, subject, to, the, development, of, structures, with, a, maximum, power, of, 3, kwp, or, less, or, to, the, incorporation, of, storage, devices, in, production, facilities, 90, of, the, water, distributed, by, martinique, s, drinking, water, network, comes, from, rainwater, intakes, in, five, catchment, areas, thus, although, there, is, no, shortage, of, water, the, situation, becomes, very, critical, in, the, lenten, period, with, abstractions, leading, to, the, drying, up, of, several, rivers, water, resources, are, abundant, but, unevenly, distributed, four, municipalities, saint, joseph, gros, morne, le, lorrain, and, fort, de, france, provide, 85, of, martinique, s, drinking, water, there, is, no, water, catchment, in, the, south, of, the, island, the, water, consumed, in, the, south, comes, exclusively, from, abstractions, from, the, north, and, the, center, mainly, from, the, blanche, river, which, flows, into, the, l, zarde, the, capot, and, the, dumauz, thus, 60, of, the, total, is, extracted, from, a, single, river, the, l, zarde, and, its, tributary, the, blanche, river, this, concentration, of, abstractions, can, constitute, a, risk, in, a, crisis, situation, such, as, a, drought, for, example, a, regional, health, agency, for, martinique, agence, r, gionale, de, sant, martinique, was, set, up, in, 2010, it, is, responsible, for, applying, french, health, policy, in, the, territory, managing, public, health,

populations, allocating, nearly, 100, million, euros, towards, the, implementation, of, these, measures, the, soils, are, regularly, tested, and, subjected, to, strict, regulations, related, to, the, standards, of, potability, martinique, is, also, subject, to, regular, mapping, processes, to, delineate, highly, contaminated, areas, river, fishing, is, also, prohibited, in, order, to, limit, health, risks, as, rivers, represent, high, risk, contamination, areas, since, 2008, the, french, state, has, developed, three, action, plans, establishing, strategies, to, protect, local, populations, raise, awareness, regarding, the, effects, of, chlordecone, as, well, as, to, support, the, agriculture, and, fisheries, sectors, a, french, parliamentary, commission, revealed, in, 2019, that, more, than, 90, of, martinicans, have, been, exposed, to, chlordecone, which, was, authorized, for, use, between, 1972, and, 1993, in, the, banana, plantations, of, the, antilles, the, committee, judged, the, three, chlordecone, plans, launched, by, the, state, since, 2008, to, be, inadequate, recommendations, were, provided, via, its, rapporteur, justine, benin, mp, to, address, prevention, and, research, into, cleanup, methods, for, a, fourth, plan, scheduled, for, 2020, the, parliamentary, commission, of, inquiry, called, the, french, state, into, question, for, having, authorized, the, sale, of, chlordecone, as, an, insecticide, as, its, toxicity, was, known, but, responsibilities, are, shared, with, economic, actors, firstly, industrialists, but, also, groups, of, planters, and, certain, elected, officials, chlordecone, is, known, to, have, harmful, effects, on, human, health, with, scientific, research, identifying, it, as, an, endocrine, disruptor, or, hormonally, active, chemical, agent, as, well, as, a, probable, carcinogen, particularly, in, relation, to, increasing, chances, of, prostate, cancer, occurrence, and, recurrence, as, an, endocrine, disruptor, chlordecone, can, also, lead, to, delayed, cognitive, development, in, infants, an, increased, likelihood, of, pregnancy, complications, and, may, disrupt, the, reproductive, process, the, chlordecone, molecule, has, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, that, allow, it, to, remain, for, several, centuries, in, soil, river, water, and, groundwater, thus, spreading, beyond, the, location, of, the, banana, plantations, where, this, insecticide, was, initially, administered, although, chlordecone, has, not, been, used, since, the, 1990s, the, health, risks, remain, chlordecone, contamination, occurs, through, contaminated, food, and, drink, in, the, streets, of, fort, de, france, approximately, 5, 000, to, 15, 000, residents, of, martinique, demonstrated, in, protest, on, 27, march, 2021, denouncing, the, possible, statute, of, limitations, on, a, complaint, filed, by, civil, parties, for, the, use, of, chlordecone, in, causing, life, endangerment, mise, en, danger, de, la, vie, d, autrui, the, complaint, was, issued, on, 23, february, 2006, the, french, government, s, actions, in, response, to, the, historical, authorization, of, chlordecone, are, often, criticized, by, residents, of, martinique, and, local, associations, involved, in, the, chlordecone, scandal, the, lack, of, information, transmitted, to, the, population, concerning, the, danger, of, chlordecone, between, 1993, and, 2004, is, one, of, the, main, concerns, expressed, the, civil, complaint, in, 2006, was, issued, by, several, associations, from, the, islands, of, martinique, and, guadeloupe, and, was, in, response, to, the, long, term, impacts, of, government, authorized, chlordecone, use, in, polluting, the, islands, natural, environments, and, affecting, the, health, of, inhabitants, martinique, s, first, cases, of, coronavirus, covid, 19, were, confirmed, in, march, 2020, the, pandemic, has, since, put, provision, of, health, services, under, significant, stress, as,
