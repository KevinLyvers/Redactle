destination, for, recreation, and, tourism, in, bordering, countries, and, a, rich, source, of, energy, resources, including, wind, and, wave, power, the, north, sea, has, featured, prominently, in, geopolitical, and, military, affairs, particularly, in, northern, europe, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, modern, era, it, was, also, important, globally, through, the, power, northern, europeans, projected, worldwide, during, much, of, the, middle, ages, and, into, the, modern, era, the, north, sea, was, the, centre, of, the, vikings, rise, the, hanseatic, league, the, dutch, republic, and, the, british, each, sought, to, gain, command, of, the, north, sea, and, access, to, the, world, s, markets, and, resources, as, germany, s, only, outlet, to, the, ocean, the, north, sea, was, strategically, important, through, both, world, wars, the, coast, has, diverse, geology, and, geography, in, the, north, deep, fjords, and, sheer, cliffs, mark, much, of, its, norwegian, and, scottish, coastlines, respectively, whereas, in, the, south, the, coast, consists, mainly, of, sandy, beaches, estuaries, of, long, rivers, and, wide, mudflats, due, to, the, dense, population, heavy,

is, fresh, water, inflow, such, as, at, the, rhine, and, elbe, estuaries, the, baltic, sea, exit, and, along, the, coast, of, norway, the, main, pattern, to, the, flow, of, water, in, the, north, sea, is, an, anti, clockwise, rotation, along, the, edges, the, north, sea, is, an, arm, of, the, atlantic, ocean, receiving, the, majority, of, ocean, current, from, the, northwest, opening, and, a, lesser, portion, of, warm, current, from, the, smaller, opening, at, the, english, channel, these, tidal, currents, leave, along, the, norwegian, coast, surface, and, deep, water, currents, may, move, in, different, directions, low, salinity, surface, coastal, waters, move, offshore, and, deeper, denser, high, salinity, waters, move, inshore, the, north, sea, located, on, the, continental, shelf, has, different, waves, from, those, in, deep, ocean, water, the, wave, speeds, are, diminished, and, the, wave, amplitudes, are, increased, in, the, north, sea, there, are, two, amphidromic, systems, and, a, third, incomplete, amphidromic, system, in, the, north, sea, the, average, tide, difference, in, wave, amplitude, is, between, zero, and, eight, metres, 26, ft, the, kelvin, tide, of, the, atlantic, ocean, is, a, semidiurnal, wave, that, travels, northward, some, of, the, energy, from, this, wave, travels, through, the, english, channel, into, the, north, sea, the, wave, continues, to, travel, northward, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, once, past, the, northern, tip, of, great, britain, the, kelvin, wave, turns, east, and, south, and, once, again, enters, the, north, sea, the, eastern, and, western, coasts, of, the, north, sea, are, jagged, formed, by, glaciers, during, the, ice, ages, the, coastlines, along, the, southernmost, part, are, covered, with, the, remains, of, deposited, glacial, sediment, the, norwegian, mountains, plunge, into, the, sea, creating, deep, fjords, and, archipelagos, south, of, stavanger, the, coast, softens, the, islands, become, fewer, the, eastern, scottish, coast, is, similar, though, less, severe, than, norway, from, north, east, of, england, the, cliffs, become, lower, and, are, composed, of, less, resistant, moraine, which, erodes, more, easily, so, that, the, coasts, have, more, rounded, contours, in, the, netherlands, belgium, and, in, east, anglia, the, littoral, is, low, and, marshy, the, east, coast, and, south, east, of, the, north, sea, wadden, sea, have, coastlines, that, are, mainly, sandy, and, straight, owing, to, longshore, drift, particularly, along, belgium, and, denmark, the, southern, coastal, areas, were, originally, flood, plains, and, swampy, land, in, areas, especially, vulnerable, to, storm, surges, people, settled, behind, elevated, levees, and, on, natural, areas, of, high, ground, such, as, spits, and, geestland, as, early, as, 500, bc, people, were, constructing, artificial, dwelling, hills, higher, than, the, prevailing, flood, levels, it, was, only, around, the, beginning, of, the, high, middle, ages, in, 1200, ad, that, inhabitants, began, to, connect, single, ring, dikes, into, a, dike, line, along, the, entire, coast, thereby, turning, amphibious, regions, between, the, land, and, the, sea, into, permanent, solid, ground, the, modern, form, of, the, dikes, supplemented, by, overflow, and, lateral, diversion, channels, began, to, appear, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, built, in, the, netherlands, the, north, sea, floods, of, 1953, and, 1962, were, the, impetus, for, further, raising, of, the, dikes, as, well, as, the, shortening, of, the, coast, line, so, as, to, present, as, little, surface, area, as, possible, to, the, punishment, of, the, sea, and, the, storms, currently, 27, of, the, netherlands, is, below, sea, level, protected, by, dikes, dunes, and, beach, flats, coastal, management, today, consists, of, several, levels, the, dike, slope, reduces, the, energy, of, the, incoming, sea, so, that, the, dike, itself, does, not, receive, the, full, impact, dikes, that, lie, directly, on, the, sea, are, especially, reinforced, the, dikes, have, over, the, years, been, repeatedly, raised, sometimes, up, to, 9, metres, 30, ft, and, have, been, made, flatter, to, better, reduce, wave, erosion, where, the, dunes, are, sufficient, to, protect, the, land, behind, them, from, the, sea, these, dunes, are, planted, with, beach, grass, ammophila, arenaria, to, protect, them, from, erosion, by, wind, water, and, foot, traffic, storm, surges, threaten, in, particular, the, coasts, of, the, netherlands, belgium, germany, and, denmark, and, low, lying, areas, of, eastern, england, particularly, around, the, wash, and, fens, storm, surges, are, caused, by, changes, in, barometric, pressure, combined, with, strong, wind, created, wave, action, the, first, recorded, storm, tide, flood, was, the, julianenflut, on, 17, february, 1164, in, its, wake, the, jadebusen, a, bay, on, the, coast, of, germany, began, to, form, a, storm, tide, in, 1228, is, recorded, to, have, killed, more, than, 100, 000, people, in, 1362, the, second, marcellus, flood, also, known, as, the, grote, manndrenke, hit, the, entire, southern, coast, of, the, north, sea, chronicles, of, the, time, again, record, more, than, 100, 000, deaths, large, parts, of, the, coast, were, lost, permanently, to, the, sea, including, the, now, legendary, lost, city, of, rungholt, in, the, 20th, century, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1953, flooded, several, nations, coasts, and, cost, more, than, 2, 000, lives, 315, citizens, of, hamburg, died, in, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1962, though, rare, the, north, sea, has, been, the, site, of, a, number, of, historically, documented, tsunamis, the, storegga, slides, were, a, series, of, underwater, landslides, in, which, a, piece, of, the, norwegian, continental, shelf, slid, into, the, norwegian, sea, the, immense, landslips, occurred, between, 8150, bce, and, 6000, bce, and, caused, a, tsunami, up, to, 20, metres, 66, ft, high, that, swept, through, the, north, sea, having, the, greatest, effect, on, scotland, and, the, faeroe, islands, the, dover, straits, earthquake, of, 1580, is, among, the, first, recorded, earthquakes, in, the, north, sea, measuring, between, 5, 6, and, 5, 9, on, the, richter, scale, this, event, caused, extensive, damage, in, calais, both, through, its, tremors, and, possibly, triggered, a, tsunami, though, this, has, never, been, confirmed, the, theory, is, a, vast, underwater, landslide, in, the, english, channel, was, triggered, by, the, earthquake, which, in, turn, caused, a, tsunami, the, tsunami, triggered, by, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, reached, holland, although, the, waves, had, lost, their, destructive, power, the, largest, earthquake, ever, recorded, in, the, united, kingdom, was, the, 1931, dogger, bank, earthquake, which, measured, 6, 1, on, the, richter, magnitude, scale, and, caused, a, small, tsunami, that, flooded, parts, of, the, british, coast, shallow, epicontinental, seas, like, the, current, north, sea, have, since, long, existed, on, the, european, continental, shelf, the, rifting, that, formed, the, northern, part, of, the, atlantic, ocean, during, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, from, about, 150, million, years, ago, caused, tectonic, uplift, in, the, british, isles, since, then, a, shallow, sea, has, almost, continuously, existed, between, the, uplands, of, the, fennoscandian, shield, and, the, british, isles, this, precursor, of, the, current, north, sea, has, grown, and, shrunk, with, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, eustatic, sea, level, during, geologic, time, sometimes, it, was, connected, with, other, shallow, seas, such, as, the, sea, above, the, paris, basin, to, the, south, west, the, paratethys, sea, to, the, south, east, or, the, tethys, ocean, to, the, south, during, the, late, cretaceous, about, 85, million, years, ago, all, of, modern, mainland, europe, except, for, scandinavia, was, a, scattering, of, islands, by, the, early, oligocene, 34, to, 28, million, years, ago, the, emergence, of, western, and, central, europe, had, almost, completely, separated, the, north, sea, from, the, tethys, ocean, which, gradually, shrank, to, become, the, mediterranean, as, southern, europe, and, south, west, asia, became, dry, land, the, north, sea, was, cut, off, from, the, english, channel, by, a, narrow, land, bridge, until, that, was, breached, by, at, least, two, catastrophic, floods, between, 450, 000, and, 180, 000, years, ago, since, the, start, of, the, quaternary, period, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, the, eustatic, sea, level, has, fallen, during, each, glacial, period, and, then, risen, again, every, time, the, ice, sheet, reached, its, greatest, extent, the, north, sea, became, almost, completely, dry, the, dry, landmass, being, known, as, doggerland, whose, northern, regions, were, themselves, known, to, have, been, glaciated, the, present, day, coastline, formed, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, when, the, sea, began, to, flood, the, european, continental, shelf, in, 2006, a, bone, fragment, was, found, while, drilling, for, oil, in, the, north, sea, analysis, indicated, that, it, was, a, plateosaurus, from, 199, to, 216, million, years, ago, this, was, the, deepest, dinosaur, fossil, ever, found, and, the, first, find, for, norway, copepods, and, other, zooplankton, are, plentiful, in, the, north, sea, these, tiny, organisms, are, crucial, elements, of, the, food, chain, supporting, many, species, of, fish, over, 230, species, of, fish, live, in, the, north, sea, cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and, sandeel, are, all, very, common, and, are, fished, commercially, due, to, the, various, depths, of, the, north, sea, trenches, and, differences, in, salinity, temperature, and, water, movement, some, fish, such, as, blue, mouth, redfish, and, rabbitfish, reside, only, in, small, areas, of, the, north, sea, crustaceans, are, also, commonly, found, throughout, the, sea, norway, lobster, deep, water, prawns, and, brown, shrimp, are, all, commercially, fished, but, other, species, of, lobster, shrimp, oyster, mussels, and, clams, all, live, in, the, north, sea, recently, non, indigenous, species, have, become, established, including, the, pacific, oyster, and, atlantic, jackknife, clam, the, coasts, of, the, north, sea, are, home, to, nature, reserves, including, the, ythan, estuary, fowlsheugh, nature, preserve, and, farne, islands, in, the, uk, and, the, wadden, sea, national, parks, in, denmark, germany, and, the, netherlands, these, locations, provide, breeding, habitat, for, dozens, of, bird, species, tens, of, millions, of, birds, make, use, of, the, north, sea, for, breeding, feeding, or, migratory, stopovers, every, year, populations, of, black, legged, kittiwakes, atlantic, puffins, northern, gannets, northern, fulmars, and, species, of, petrels, seaducks, loons, divers, cormorants, gulls, auks, and, terns, and, many, other, seabirds, make, these, coasts, popular, for, birdwatching, the, north, sea, is, also, home, to, marine, mammals, common, seals, grey, seals, and, harbour, porpoises, can, be, found, along, the, coasts, at, marine, installations, and, on, islands, the, very, northern, north, sea, islands, such, as, the, shetland, islands, are, occasionally, home, to, a, larger, variety, of, pinnipeds, including, bearded, harp, hooded, and, ringed, seals, and, even, walrus, north, sea, cetaceans, include, various, porpoise, dolphin, and, whale, species, plant, species, in, the, north, sea, include, species, of, wrack, among, them, bladder, wrack, knotted, wrack, and, serrated, wrack, algae, macroalgal, and, kelp, such, as, oarweed, and, laminaria, hyperboria, and, species, of, maerl, are, found, as, well, eelgrass, formerly, common, in, the, entirety, of, the, wadden, sea, was, nearly, wiped, out, in, the, 20th, century, by, a, disease, similarly, sea, grass, used, to, coat, huge, tracts, of, ocean, floor, but, have, been, damaged, by, trawling, and, dredging, have, diminished, its, habitat, and, prevented, its, return, invasive, japanese, seaweed, has, spread, along, the, shores, of, the, sea, clogging, harbours, and, inlets, and, has, become, a, nuisance, due, to, the, heavy, human, populations, and, high, level, of, industrialization, along, its, shores, the, wildlife, of, the, north, sea, has, suffered, from, pollution, overhunting, and, overfishing, flamingos, and, pelicans, were, once, found, along, the, southern, shores, of, the, north, sea, but, became, extinct, over, the, second, millennium, walruses, frequented, the, orkney, islands, through, the, mid, 16th, century, as, both, sable, island, and, orkney, islands, lay, within, their, normal, range, grey, whales, also, resided, in, the, north, sea, but, were, driven, to, extinction, in, the, atlantic, in, the, 17th, century, other, species, have, dramatically, declined, in, population, though, they, are, still, found, north, atlantic, right, whales, sturgeon, shad, rays, skates, salmon, and, other, species, were, common, in, the, north, sea, until, the, 20th, century, when, numbers, declined, due, to, overfishing, other, factors, like, the, introduction, of, non, indigenous, species, industrial, and, agricultural, pollution, trawling, and, dredging, human, induced, eutrophication, construction, on, coastal, breeding, and, feeding, grounds, sand, and, gravel, extraction, offshore, construction, and, heavy, shipping, traffic, have, also, contributed, to, the, decline, for, example, a, resident, orca, pod, was, lost, in, the, 1960s, presumably, due, to, the, peak, in, pcb, pollution, in, this, time, period, the, ospar, commission, manages, the, ospar, convention, to, counteract, the, harmful, effects, of, human, activity, on, wildlife, in, the, north, sea, preserve, endangered, species, and, provide, environmental, protection, all, north, sea, border, states, are, signatories, of, the, marpol, 73, 78, accords, which, preserve, the, marine, environment, by, preventing, pollution, from, ships, germany, denmark, and, the, netherlands, also, have, a, trilateral, agreement, for, the, protection, of, the, wadden, sea, or, mudflats, which, run, along, the, coasts, of, the, three, countries, on, the, southern, edge, of, the, north, sea, the, north, sea, has, had, various, names, throughout, history, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, names, was, septentrionalis, oceanus, or, northern, ocean, which, was, cited, by, pliny, he, also, noted, that, the, cimbri, called, it, morimarusa, dead, sea, the, name, north, sea, probably, came, into, english, however, via, the, dutch, noordzee, who, named, it, thus, either, in, contrast, with, the, zuiderzee, south, sea, located, south, of, frisia, or, because, the, sea, is, generally, to, the, north, of, the, netherlands, before, the, adoption, of, north, sea, the, names, used, in, english, were, german, sea, or, german, ocean, referred, to, as, the, latin, names, mare, germanicum, and, oceanus, germanicus, and, these, persisted, in, use, until, the, first, world, war, other, common, names, in, use, for, long, periods, were, the, latin, terms, mare, frisicum, as, well, as, the, english, equivalent, frisian, sea, the, modern, names, of, the, sea, in, the, other, local, languages, are, danish, vesterhavet, west, sea, or, nords, en, dutch, noordzee, dutch, low, saxon, noordzee, french, mer, du, nord, west,

gaelic, an, cuan, a, tuath, the, north, sea, has, provided, waterway, access, for, commerce, and, conquest, many, areas, have, access, to, the, north, sea, because, of, its, long, coastline, and, the, european, rivers, that, empty, it, there, is, little, documentary, evidence, concerning, the, north, sea, before, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, in, 43, ce, however, archaeological, evidence, reveals, the, diffusion, of, cultures, and, technologies, from, across, or, along, the, north, sea, to, great, britain, and, scandinavia, and, reliance, by, some, prehistoric, cultures, on, fishing,

against, the, romans, and, roman, coinage, and, manufacturing, were, important, trade, goods, when, the, romans, abandoned, britain, in, 410, the, germanic, angles, frisians, saxons, and, jutes, began, the, next, great, migration, across, the, north, sea, during, the, migration, period, they, made, successive, invasions, of, the, island, from, what, is, now, the, netherlands, denmark, and, germany, the, viking, age, began, in, 793, with, the, attack, on, lindisfarne, for, the, next, quarter, millennium, the, vikings, ruled, the, north, sea, in, their, superior, longships, they, raided, traded, and, established, colonies, and, outposts, along, the, coasts, of, the, sea, from, the, middle, ages, through, the, 15th, century, the, northern, european, coastal, ports, exported, domestic,

grade, cloths, spices, and, fruits, from, the, mediterranean, region, commerce, during, this, era, was, mainly, conducted, by, maritime, trade, due, to, underdeveloped, roadways, in, the, 13th, century, the, hanseatic, league, though, centred, on, the, baltic, sea, started, to, control, most, of, the, trade, through, important, members, and, outposts, on, the, north, sea, the, league, lost, its, dominance, in, the, 16th, century, as, neighbouring, states, took, control, of, former, hanseatic, cities, and, outposts, their, internal, conflict, prevented, effective, cooperation, and, defence, as, the, league, lost, control, of, its, maritime, cities, new, trade, routes, emerged, that, provided, europe, with, asian, american, and, african, goods, the, 17th, century, dutch, golden, age, saw, dutch, maritime, power, at, its, zenith, important, overseas, colonies, a, vast, merchant, marine, a, large, fishing, fleet, powerful, navy, and, sophisticated, financial, markets, made, the, dutch, the, ascendant, power, in, the, north, sea, to, be, challenged, by, an, ambitious, england, this, rivalry, led, to, the, first, three, anglo, dutch, wars, between, 1652, and, 1673, which, ended, with, dutch, victories, after, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1688, the, dutch, prince, william, ascended, to, the, english, throne, with, unified, leadership, commercial, military, and, political, power, began, to, shift, from, amsterdam, to, london, the, british, did, not, face, a, challenge, to, their, dominance, of, the, north, sea, until, the, 20th, century, tensions, in, the, north, sea, were, again, heightened, in, 1904, by, the, dogger, bank, incident, during, the, russo, japanese, war, several, ships, of, the, russian, baltic, fleet, which, was, on, its, way, to, the, far, east, mistook, british, fishing, boats, for, japanese, ships, and, fired, on, them, and, then, upon, each, other, near, the, dogger, bank, nearly, causing, britain, to, enter, the, war, on, the, side, of, japan, during, the, first, world, war, great, britain, s, grand, fleet, and, germany, s, kaiserliche, marine, faced, each, other, in, the, north, sea, which, became, the, main, theatre, of, the, war, for, surface, action, britain, s, larger, fleet, and, north, sea, mine, barrage, were, able, to, establish, an, effective, blockade, for, most, of, the, war, which, restricted, the, central, powers, access, to, many, crucial, resources, major, battles, included, the, battle, of, heligoland, bight, the, battle, of, the, dogger, bank, and, the, battle, of, jutland, world, war, i, also, brought, the, first, extensive, use, of, submarine, warfare, and, a, number, of, submarine, actions, occurred, in, the, north, sea, the, second, world, war, also, saw, action, in, the, north, sea, though, it, was, restricted, more, to, aircraft, reconnaissance, and, action, by, fighter, bomber, aircraft, submarines, and, smaller, vessels, such, as, minesweepers, and, torpedo, boats, after, the, war, hundreds, of, thousands, of, tons, of, chemical, weapons, were, disposed, of, by, being, dumped, in, the, north, sea, after, the, war, the, north, sea, lost, much, of, its, military, significance, because, it, is, bordered, only, by, nato, member, states, however, it, gained, significant, economic, importance, in, the, 1960s, as, the, states, around, the, north, sea, began, full, scale, exploitation, of, its, oil, and, gas, resources, the, north, sea, continues, to, be, an, active, trade, route, countries, that, border, the, north, sea, all, claim, the, 12, nautical, miles, 22, km, 14, mi, of, territorial, waters, within, which, they, have, exclusive, fishing, rights, the, common, fisheries, policy, of, the, european, union, eu, exists, to, coordinate, fishing, rights, and, assist, with, disputes, between, eu, states, and, the, eu, border, state, of, norway, after, the, discovery, of, mineral, resources, in, the, north, sea, during, the, early, 1960s, the, convention, on, the, continental, shelf, established, country, rights, largely, divided, along, the, median, line, the, median, line, is, defined, as, the, line, every, point, of, which, is, equidistant, from, the, nearest, points, of, the, baselines, from, which, the, breadth, of, the, territorial, sea, of, each, state, is, measured, the, ocean, floor, border, between, germany, the, netherlands, and, denmark, was, only, reapportioned, in, 1969, after, protracted, negotiations, and, a, judgment, of, the, international, court, of, justice, as, early, as, 1859, oil, was, discovered, in, onshore, areas, around, the, north, sea, and, natural, gas, as, early, as, 1910, onshore, resources, for, example, the, k12, b, field, in, the, netherlands, continue, to, be, exploited, today, offshore, test, drilling, began, in, 1966, and, then, in, 1969, phillips, petroleum, company, discovered, the, ekofisk, oil, field, distinguished, by, valuable, low, sulphur, oil, commercial, exploitation, began, in, 1971, with, tankers, and, after, 1975, by, a, pipeline, first, to, teesside, england, and, then, after, 1977, also, to, emden, germany, the, exploitation, of, the, north, sea, oil, reserves, began, just, before, the, 1973, oil, crisis, and, the, climb, of, international, oil, prices, made, the, large, investments, needed, for, extraction, much, more, attractive, the, start, in, 1973, of, the, oil, reserves, by, the, uk, allowed, them, to, stop, the, declining, position, in, international, trade, in, 1974, and, a, huge, increase, after, the, discovery, and, exploitation, of, the, huge, oil, field, by, phillips, group, in, 1977, as, the, brae, field, although, the, production, costs, are, relatively, high, the, quality, of, the, oil, the, political, stability, of, the, region, and, the, proximity, of, important, markets, in, western, europe, have, made, the, north, sea, an, important, oil, producing, region, the, largest, single, humanitarian, catastrophe, in, the, north, sea, oil, industry, was, the, destruction, of, the, offshore, oil, platform, piper, alpha, in, 1988, in, which, 167, people, lost, their, lives, besides, the, ekofisk, oil, field, the, statfjord, oil, field, is, also, notable, as, it, was, the, cause, of, the, first, pipeline, to, span, the, norwegian, trench, the, largest, natural, gas, field, in, the, north, sea, troll, gas, field, lies, in, the, norwegian, trench, dropping, over, 300, metres, 980, ft, requiring, the, construction, of, the, enormous, troll, a, platform, to, access, it, the, price, of, brent, crude, one, of, the, first, types, of, oil, extracted, from, the, north, sea, is, used, today, as, a, standard, price, for, comparison, for, crude, oil, from, the, rest, of, the, world, the, north, sea, contains, western, europe, s, largest, oil, and, natural, gas, reserves, and, is, one, of, the, world, s, key, non, opec, producing, regions, in, the, uk, sector, of, the, north, sea, the, oil, industry, invested, 14, 4, billion, in, 2013, and, was, on, track, to, spend, 13, billion, in, 2014, industry, body, oil, gas, uk, put, the, decline, down, to, rising, costs, lower, production, high, tax, rates, and, less, exploration, in, january, 2018, the, north, sea, region, contained, 184, offshore, rigs, which, made, it, the, region, with, the, highest, number, of, offshore, rigs, in, the, world, at, the, time, the, north, sea, is, europe, s, main, fishery, accounting, for, over, 5, of, international, commercial, fish, caught, fishing, in, the, north, sea, is, concentrated, in, the, southern, part, of, the, coastal, waters, the, main, method, of, fishing, is, trawling, in, 1995, the, total, volume, of, fish, and, shellfish, caught, in, the, north, sea, was, approximately, 3, 5, million, tonnes, besides, saleable, fish, it, is, estimated, that, one, million, tonnes, of, unmarketable, by, catch, is, caught, and, discarded, to, die, each, year, in, recent, decades, overfishing, has, left, many, fisheries, unproductive, disturbing, marine, food, chain, dynamics, and, costing, jobs, in, the, fishing, industry, herring, cod, and, plaice, fisheries, may, soon, face, the, same, plight, as, mackerel, fishing, which, ceased, in, the, 1970s, due, to, overfishing, the, objective, of, the, european, union, common, fisheries, policy, is, to, minimize, the, environmental, impact, associated, with, resource, use, by, reducing, fish, discards, increasing, the, productivity, of, fisheries, stabilising, markets, of, fisheries, and, fish, processing, and, supplying, fish, at, reasonable, prices, for, the, consumer, whaling, was, an, important, economic, activity, from, the, 9th, until, the, 13th, century, for, flemish, whalers, the, medieval, flemish, basque, and, norwegian, whalers, who, were, replaced, in, the, 16th, century, by, dutch, english, danes, and, germans, took, massive, numbers, of, whales, and, dolphins, and, nearly, depleted, the, right, whales, this, activity, likely, led, to, the, extinction, of, the, atlantic, population, of, the, once, common, grey, whale, by, 1902, the, whaling, had, ended, after, being, absent, for, 300, years, a, single, grey, whale, returned, in, 2010, it, probably, was, the, first, of, many, more, to, find, its, way, through, the, now, ice, free, northwest, passage, in, addition, to, oil, gas, and, fish, the, states, along, the, north, sea, also, take, millions, of, cubic, metres, per, year, of, sand, and, gravel, from, the, ocean, floor, these, are, used, for, beach, nourishment, land, reclamation, and, construction, rolled, pieces, of, amber, may, be, picked, up, on, the, east, coast, of, england, due, to, the, strong, prevailing, winds, and, shallow, water, countries, on, the, north, sea, particularly, germany, and, denmark, have, used, the, shore, for, wind, power, since, the, 1990s, the, north, sea, is, the, home, of, one, of, the, first, large, scale, offshore, wind, farms, in, the, world, horns, rev, 1, completed, in, 2002, since, then, many, other, wind, farms, have, been, commissioned, in, the, north, sea, and, elsewhere, as, of, 2013, the, 630, megawatt, mw, london, array, is, the, largest, offshore, wind, farm, in, the, world, with, the, 504, mw, greater, gabbard, wind, farm, the, second, largest, followed, by, the, 367, mw, walney, wind, farm, all, are, off, the, coast, of, the, uk, these, projects, will, be, dwarfed, by, subsequent, wind, farms, that, are, in, the, pipeline, including, dogger, bank, at, 4, 800, mw, norfolk, bank, 7, 200, mw, and, irish, sea,

year, of, 2013, the, development, of, the, offshore, wind, industry, in, uk, controlled, areas, of, the, north, sea, is, traced, to, three, phases, coastal, off, coastal, and, deep, offshore, in, the, period, 2004, 2021, the, expansion, of, offshore, wind, farms, has, met, with, some, resistance, concerns, have, included, shipping, collisions, and, environmental, effects, on, ocean, ecology, and, wildlife, such, as, fish, and, migratory, birds, however, these, concerns, were, found, to, be, negligible, in, a, long, term, study, in, denmark, released, in, 2006, and, again, in, a, uk, government, study, in, 2009, there, are, also, concerns, about, reliability, and, the, rising, costs, of, constructing, and, maintaining, offshore, wind, farms, despite, these, development, of, north, sea, wind, power, is, continuing, with, plans, for, additional, wind, farms, off, the, coasts, of, germany, the, netherlands, and, the, uk, there, have, also, been, proposals, for, a, transnational, power, grid, in, the, north, sea, to, connect, new, offshore, wind, farms, energy, production, from, tidal, power, is, still, in, a, pre, commercial, stage, the, european, marine, energy, centre, has, installed, a, wave, testing, system, at, billia, croo, on, the, orkney, mainland, and, a, tidal, power, testing, station, on, the, nearby, island, of, eday, since, 2003, a, prototype, wave, dragon,
