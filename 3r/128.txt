the, floodplain, of, the, yangtze, valley, an, area, that, naturally, floods, every, summer, and, is, habitable, only, because, it, is, protected, by, river, dikes, the, floods, large, enough, to, overflow, the, dikes, have, caused, great, distress, to, those, who, live, and, farm, there, floods, of, note, include, those, of, 1931, 1954, and, 1998, the, 1931, central, china, floods, or, the, central, china, floods, of, 1931, were, a, series, of, floods, that, are, generally, considered, among, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, ever, recorded, and, almost, certainly, the, deadliest, of, the, 20th, century, when, pandemics, and, famines, are, discounted, estimates, of, the, total, death, toll, range, from, 145, 000, to, between, 3, 7, million, and, 4, million, the, yangtze, flooded, again, in, 1935, causing, great, loss, of, life, from, june, to, september, 1954, the, yangtze, river, floods, were, a, series, of, catastrophic, floodings, that, occurred, mostly, in, hubei, province, due, to, unusually, high, volume, of, precipitation, as, well, as, an, extraordinarily, long, rainy, season, in, the, middle, stretch, of, the, yangtze, river, late, in, the, spring, of, 1954, the, river, started, to, rise, above, its, usual, level, in, around, late, june, despite, efforts, to, open, three, important, flood, gates, to, alleviate, the, rising, water, by, diverting, it, the, flood, level, continued, to, rise, until, it, hit, the, historic, high, of, 44, 67, m, in, jingzhou, hubei, and, 29, 73, m, in, wuhan, the, number, of, dead, from, this, flood, was, estimated, at, 33, 000, including, those, who, died, of, plague, in, the, aftermath, of, the, disaster, the, 1998, yangtze, river, floods, were, a, series, of, major, floods, that, lasted, from, middle, of, june, to, the, beginning, of, september, 1998, along, the, yangtze, in, the, summer, of, 1998, china, experienced, massive, flooding, of, parts, of, the, yangtze, river, resulting, in, 3, 704, dead, 15, million, homeless, and, 26, billion, in, economic, loss, other, sources, report, a, total, loss, of, 4150, people, and, 180, million, people, were, affected, a, staggering, 25, million, acres, 100, 000, km, 2, were, evacuated, 13, 3, million, houses, were, damaged, or, destroyed, the, floods, caused, 26, billion, in, damages, the, 2016, china, floods, caused, us, 22, billion, in, damages, in, 2020, the, yangtze, river, saw, the, heaviest, rainfall, since, 1961, with, a, 79, increase, in, june, and, july, compared, to, the, average, for, the, period, over, the, previous, 41, years, a, new, theory, suggested, that, abrupt, reduction, in, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, and, aerosols, caused, by, shutdowns, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, was, a, key, cause, of, the, intense, downpours, over, the, past, decades, rainfall, had, decreased, due, to, increase, of, aerosols, in, the, atmosphere, and, lower, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2020, caused, the, opposite, effect, a, major, increase, in, rain, such, a, dramatic, reduction, of, aerosols, caused, a, dramatic, change, in, the, various, components, of, the, climate, system, but, such, sudden, change, of, the, climate, system, would, be, very, different, from, changes, in, response, to, continuous, but, gradual, policy, driven, emissions, reductions, beginning, in, the, 1950s, dams, and, dikes, were, built, for, flood, control, land, reclamation, irrigation, and, control, of, diseases, vectors, such, as, blood, flukes, that, caused, schistosomiasis, more, than, a, hundred, lakes, were, thusly, cut, off, from, the, main, river, there, were, gates, between, the, lakes, that, could, be, opened, during, floods, however, farmers, and, settlements, encroached, on, the, land, next, to, the, lakes, although, it, was, forbidden, to, settle, there, when, floods, came, it, proved, impossible, to, open, the, gates, since, it, would, have, caused, substantial, destruction, thus, the, lakes, partially, or, completely, dried, up, for, example, baidang, lake, shrunk, from, 100, square, kilometers, 39, sq, mi, in, the, 1950s, to, 40, square, kilometers, 15, sq, mi, in, 2005, zhangdu, lake, dwindled, to, one, quarter, of, its, original, size, natural, fisheries, output, in, the, two, lakes, declined, sharply, only, a, few, large, lakes, such, as, poyang, lake, and, dongting, lake, remained, connected, to, the, yangtze, cutting, off, the, other, lakes, that, had, served, as, natural, buffers, for, floods, increased, the, damage, done, by, floods, further, downstream, furthermore, the, natural, flow, of, migratory, fish, was, obstructed, and, biodiversity, across, the, whole, basin, decreased, dramatically, intensive, farming, of, fish, in, ponds, spread, using, one, type, of, carp, who, thrived, in, eutrophic, water, conditions, and, who, feeds, on, algae, causing, widespread, pollution, the, pollution, was, exacerbated, by, the, discharge, of, waste, from, pig, farms, as, well, as, of, untreated, industrial, and, municipal, sewage, in, september, 2012, the, yangtze, river, near, chongqing, turned, red, from, pollution, the, erection, of, the, three, gorges, dam, has, created, an, impassable, iron, barrier, that, has, led, to, a, great, reduction, in, the, biodiversity, of, the, river, yangtze, sturgeon, use, seasonal, changes, in, the, flow, of, the, river, to, signal, when, is, it, time, to, migrate, however, these, seasonal, changes, will, be, greatly, reduced, by, dams, and, diversions, other, animals, facing, immediate, threat, of, extinction, are, the, baiji, dolphin, narrow, ridged, finless, porpoise, and, the, yangtze, alligator, these, animals, numbers, went, into, freefall, from, the, combined, effects, of, accidental, catches, during, fishing, river, traffic, habitat, loss, and, pollution, in, 2006, the, baiji, dolphin, became, extinct, the, world, lost, an, entire, genus, in, 2020, a, sweeping, law, was, passed, by, the, chinese, government, to, protect, the, ecology, of, the, river, the, new, laws, include, strengthening, ecological, protection, rules, for, hydropower, projects, along, the, river, banning, chemical, plants, within, 1, kilometer, of, the, river, relocating, polluting, industries, severely, restricting, sand, mining, as, well, as, a, complete, fishing, ban, on, all, the, natural, waterways, of, the, river, including, all, its, major, tributaries, and, lakes, the, yangtze, river, produces, more, ocean, plastic, pollution, than, any, other, according, to, the, ocean, cleanup, a, dutch, environmental, research, foundation, that, focuses, on, ocean, pollution, ten, rivers, transport, 90, of, all, the, plastic, that, reaches, the, oceans, with, the, yangtze, river, being, the, biggest, polluter, in, 2002, a, pilot, program, was, initiated, to, reconnect, lakes, to, the, yangtze, with, the, objective, to, increase, biodiversity, and, to, alleviate, flooding, the, first, lakes, to, be, reconnected, in, 2004, were, zhangdu, lake, honghu, lake, and, tian, e, zhou, in, hubei, on, the, middle, yangtze, in, 2005, baidang, lake, in, anhui, was, also, reconnected, reconnecting, the, lakes, improved, water, quality, and, fish, were, able, to, migrate, from, the, river, into, the, lake, replenishing, their, numbers, and, genetic, stock, the, trial, also, showed, that, reconnecting, the, lake, reduced, flooding, the, new, approach, also, benefitted, the, farmers, economically, pond, farmers, switched, to, natural, fish, feed, which, helped, them, breed, better, quality, fish, that, can, be, sold, for, more, increasing, their, income, by, 30, based, on, the, successful, pilot, project, other, provincial, governments, emulated, the, experience, and, also, reestablished, connections, to, lakes, that, had, previously, been, cut, off, from, the, river, in, 2005, a, yangtze, forum, has, been, established, bringing, together, 13, riparian, provincial, governments, to, manage, the, river, from, source, to, sea, in, 2006, china, s, ministry, of, agriculture, made, it, a, national, policy, to, reconnect, the, yangtze, river, with, its, lakes, as, of, 2010, provincial, governments, in, five, provinces, and, shanghai, set, up, a, network, of, 40, effective, protected, areas, covering, 16, 500, km, 2, 6, 400, sq, mi, as, a, result, populations, of, 47, threatened, species, increased, including, the, critically, endangered, yangtze, alligator, in, the, shanghai, area, reestablished, wetlands, now, protect, drinking, water, sources, for, the, city, it, is, envisaged, to, extend, the, network, throughout, the, entire, yangtze, to, eventually, cover, 102, areas, and, 185, 000, km, 2, 71, 000, sq, mi, the, mayor, of, wuhan, announced, that, six, huge, stagnating, urban, lakes, including, the, east, lake, wuhan, would, be, reconnected, at, the, cost, of, us, 2, 3, billion, creating, china, s, largest, urban, wetland, landscape, download, coordinates, as, until, 1957, there, were, no, bridges, across, the, yangtze, river, from, yibin, to, shanghai, for, millennia, travelers, crossed, the, river, by, ferry, on, occasions, the, crossing, may, have, been, dangerous, as, evidenced, by, the, zhong, anlun, disaster, october, 15, 1945, the, river, stood, as, a, major, geographic, barrier, dividing, northern, and, southern, china, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, rail, passengers, from, beijing, to, guangzhou, and, shanghai, had, to, disembark, respectively, at, hanyang, and, pukou, and, cross, the, river, by, steam, ferry, before, resuming, journeys, by, train, from, wuchang, or, nanjing, west, after, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, in, 1949, soviet, engineers, assisted, in, the, design, and, construction, of, the, wuhan, yangtze, river, bridge, a, dual, use, road, rail, bridge, built, from, 1955, to, 1957, it, was, the, first, bridge, across, the, yangtze, river, the, second, bridge, across, the, river, that, was, built, was, a, single, track, railway, bridge, built, upstream, in, chongqing, in, 1959, the, nanjing, yangtze, river, bridge, also, a, road, rail, bridge, was, the, first, bridge, to, cross, the, lower, reaches, of, the, yangtze, in, nanjing, it, was, built, after, the, sino, soviet, split, and, did, not, receive, foreign, assistance, road, rail, bridges, were, then, built, in, zhicheng, 1971, and, chongqing, 1980, bridge, building, slowed, in, the, 1980s, before, resuming, in, the, 1990s, and, accelerating, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, the, jiujiang, yangtze, river, bridge, was, built, in, 1992, as, part, of, the, beijing, jiujiang, railway, a, second, bridge, in, wuhan, was, completed, in, 1995, by, 2005, there, were, a, total, of, 56, bridges, and, one, tunnel, across, the, yangtze, river, between, yibin, and, shanghai, these, include, some, of, the, longest, suspension, and, cable, stayed, bridges, in, the, world, on, the, yangtze, delta, jiangyin, suspension, bridge, 1, 385, m, opened, in, 1999, runyang, bridge, 1, 490, m, opened, 2005, sutong, bridge, 1, 088, m, opened, 2008, the, rapid, pace, of, bridge, construction, has, continued, the, city, of, wuhan, now, has, six, bridges, and, one, tunnel, across, the, yangtze, a, number, of, power, line, crossings, have, also, been, built, across, the, river, as, of, 2007, there, are, two, dams, built, on, the, yangtze, river, three, gorges, dam, and, gezhouba, dam, the, three, gorges, dam, is, the, largest, power, station, in, the, world, by, installed, capacity, at, 22, 5, gw, several, dams, are, operating, or, are, being, constructed, on, the, upper, portion, of, the, river, the, jinsha, river, among, them, the, baihetan, dam, is, the, second, largest, after, the, three, gorges, dam, and, the, xiluodu, dam, is, the, 4th, largest, power, station, in, the, world, the, yangtze, river, has, over, 700, tributaries, the, major, tributaries, listed, from, upstream, to, downstream, with, the, locations, of, where, they, join, the, yangtze, are, the, huai, river, flowed, into, the, yellow, sea, until, the, 20th, century, but, now, primarily, discharges, into, the, yangtze, the, yangtze, river, has, a, high, species, richness, including, many, endemics, a, high, percentage, of, these, are, seriously, threatened, by, human, activities, as, of, 2011, 416, fish, species, are, known, from, the, yangtze, basin, including, 362, that, strictly, are, freshwater, species, the, remaining, are, also, known, from, salt, or, brackish, waters, such, as, the, river, s, estuary, or, the, east, china, sea, this, makes, it, one, of, the, most, species, rich, rivers, in, asia, and, by, far, the, most, species, rich, in, china, in, comparison, the, pearl, river, has, almost, 300, fish, species, and, the, yellow, river, 160, 178, fish, species, are, endemic, to, the, yangtze, river, basin, many, are, only, found, in, some, section, of, the, river, basin, and, especially, the, upper, reach, above, yichang, but, below, the, headwaters, in, the, qinghai, tibet, plateau, is, rich, with, 279, species, including, 147, yangtze, endemics, and, 97, strict, endemics, found, only, in, this, part, of, the, basin, in, contrast, the, headwaters, where, the, average, altitude, is, above, 4, 500, m, 14, 800, ft, are, only, home, to, 14, highly, specialized, species, but, 8, of, these, are, endemic, to, the, river, the, largest, orders, in, the, yangtze, are, cypriniformes, 280, species, including, 150, endemics, siluriformes, 40, species, including, 20, endemics, perciformes, 50, species, including, 4, endemics, tetraodontiformes, 12, species, including, 1, endemic, and, osmeriformes, 8, species, including, 1, endemic, no, other, order, has, more, than, four, species, in, the, river, and, one, endemic, many, yangtze, fish, species, have, declined, drastically, and, 65, were, recognized, as, threatened, in, the, 2009, chinese, red, list, among, these, are, three, that, are, considered, entirely, extinct, chinese, paddlefish, anabarilius, liui, liui, and, atrilinea, macrolepis, two, that, are, extinct, in, the, wild, anabarilius, polylepis, schizothorax, parvus, four, that, are, critically, endangered, euchiloglanis, kishinouyei, megalobrama, elongata, schizothorax, longibarbus, and, leiocassis, longibarbus, additionally, both, the, yangtze, sturgeon, and, chinese, sturgeon, are, considered, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, the, survival, of, these, two, sturgeon, may, rely, on, the, continued, release, of, captive, bred, specimens, although, still, listed, as, critically, endangered, rather, than, extinct, by, both, the, chinese, red, list, and, iucn, recent, reviews, have, found, that, the, chinese, paddlefish, is, extinct, surveys, conducted, between, 2006, and, 2008, by, ichthyologists, failed, to, catch, any, but, two, probable, specimens, were, recorded, with, hydroacoustic, signals, the, last, definite, record, was, an, individual, that, was, accidentally, captured, near, yibin, in, 2003, and, released, after, having, been, radio, tagged, the, chinese, sturgeon, is, the, largest, fish, in, the, river, and, among, the, largest, freshwater, fish, in, the, world, reaching, a, length, of, 5, m, 16, ft, the, extinct, chinese, paddlefish, reputedly, reached, as, much, as, 7, m, 23, ft, but, its, maximum, size, is, labeled, with, considerable, uncertainty, the, largest, threats, to, the, yangtze, native, fish, are, overfishing, and, habitat, loss, such, as, building, of, dams, and, land, reclamation, but, pollution, destructive, fishing, practices, such, as, fishing, with, dynamite, or, poison, and, introduced, species, also, cause, problems, about, 2, 3, of, the, total, freshwater, fisheries, in, china, are, in, the, yangtze, basin, but, a, drastic, decline, in, size, of, several, important, species, has, been, recorded, as, highlighted, by, data, from, lakes, in, the, river, basin, in, 2015, some, experts, recommend, a, 10, year, fishing, moratorium, to, allow, the, remaining, populations, to, recover, and, in, january, 2020, china, imposed, a, 10, year, fishing, moratorium, on, 332, sites, along, the, yangtze, dams, present, another, serious, problem, as, several, species, in, the, river, perform, breeding, migrations, and, most, of, these, are, non, jumpers, meaning, that, normal, fish, ladders, designed, for, salmon, are, ineffective, for, example, the, gezhouba, dam, blocked, the, migration, of, the, paddlerfish, and, two, sturgeon, while, also, effectively, splitting, the, chinese, high, fin, banded, shark, population, into, two, and, causing, the, extirpation, of, the, yangtze, population, of, the, japanese, eel, in, an, attempt, of, minimizing, the, effect, of, the, dams, the, three, gorges, dam, has, released, water, to, mimic, the, pre, dam, natural, flooding, and, trigger, the, breeding, of, carp, species, downstream, in, addition, to, dams, already, built, in, the, yangtze, basin, several, large, dams, are, planned, and, these, may, present, further, problems, for, the, native, fauna, while, many, fish, species, native, to, the, yangtze, are, seriously, threatened, others, have, become, important, in, fish, farming, and, introduced, widely, outside, their, native, range, a, total, of, 26, native, fish, species, of, the, yangtze, basin, are, farmed, among, the, most, important, are, four, asian, carp, grass, carp, black, carp, silver, carp, and, bighead, carp, other, species, that, support, important, fisheries, include, northern, snakehead, chinese, perch, takifugu, pufferfish, mainly, in, the, lowermost, sections, and, predatory, carp, due, to, commercial, use, of, the, river, tourism, and, pollution, the, yangtze, is, home, to, several, seriously, threatened, species, of, large, animals, in, addition, to, fish, the, narrow, ridged, finless, porpoise, baiji, yangtze, river, dolphin, chinese, alligator, yangtze, giant, softshell, turtle, and, chinese, giant, salamander, this, is, the, only, other, place, besides, the, united, states, that, is, native, to, an, alligator, and, paddlefish, species, in, 2010, the, yangtze, population, of, finless, porpoise, was, 1000, individuals, in, december, 2006, the, yangtze, river, dolphin, was, declared, functionally, extinct, after, an, extensive, search, of, the, river, revealed, no, signs, of, the, dolphin, s, inhabitance, in, 2007, a, large, white, animal, was, sighted, and, photographed, in, the, lower, yangtze, and, was, tentatively, presumed, to, be, a, baiji, however, as, there, have, been, no, confirmed, sightings, since, 2004, the, baiji, is, presumed, to, be, functionally, extinct, at, this, time, baijis, were, the, last, surviving, species, of, a, large, lineage, dating, back, seventy, million, years, and, one, of, only, six, species, of, freshwater, dolphins, it, has, been, argued, that, the, extinction, of, the, yangtze, river, dolphin, was, a, result, of, the, completion, of, the, three, gorges, dam, a, project, that, has, affected, many, species, of, animals, and, plant, life, found, only, in, the, gorges, area, numerous, species, of, land, mammals, are, found, in, the, yangtze, valley, but, most, of, these, are, not, directly, associated, with, the, river, three, exceptions, are, the, semi, aquatic, eurasian, otter, water,
