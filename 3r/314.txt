the, yucat, n, peninsula, j, u, k, t, n, t, n, yoo, k, ta, h, n, uk, also, j, k, yuu, spanish, pen, nsula, de, yucat, n, is, a, large, peninsula, in, southeast, mexico, and, adjacent, portions, of, belize, and, guatemala, the, peninsula, extends, towards, the, northeast, separating, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, north, and, west, of, the, peninsula, from, the, caribbean, sea, to, the, east, the, yucat, n, channel, between, the, northeastern, corner, of, the, peninsula, and, cuba, connects, the, two, bodies, of, water, the, peninsula, is, approximately, 181, 000, km, 2, 70, 000, sq, mi, in, area, it, has, low, relief, and, is, almost, entirely, composed, of, porous, limestone, the, peninsula, lies, east, of, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, the, narrowest, point, in, mexico, separating, the, atlantic, ocean, including, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, caribbean, sea, from, the, pacific, ocean, some, consider, the, isthmus, to, be, the, geographic, boundary, between, central, america, and, the, rest, of, north, america, placing, the, peninsula, in, central, america, politically, all, of, mexico, including, the, yucat, n, is, generally, considered, part, of, north, america, while, guatemala, and, belize, are, considered, part, of, central, america, the, proper, derivation, of, the, word, yucat, n, is, widely, debated, 17th, century, franciscan, historian, diego, l, pez, de, cogolludo, offers, two, theories, in, particular, in, the, first, one, francisco, hern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, having, first, arrived, to, the, peninsula, in, 1517, inquired, the, name, of, a, certain, settlement, and, the, response, in, yucatec, mayan, was, i, don, t, understand, which, sounded, like, yucat, n, to, the, spaniards, there, are, many, possibilities, of, what, the, natives, could, have, actually, said, among, which, mathan, cauyi, ath, n, tectec, n, ma, anaatik, ka, t, ann, and, ci, u, t, ann, this, origin, story, was, first, told, by, hern, n, cort, s, in, his, letters, to, charles, v, later, 16th, century, historians, motolinia, and, francisco, l, pez, de, g, mara, also, repeat, this, version, in, some, versions, the, expedition, is, not, the, one, captained, by, c, rdoba, but, instead, the, one, a, year, later, captained, by, juan, de, grijalva, the, second, major, theory, is, that, the, name, is, in, some, way, related, to, the, yuca, crop, as, written, by, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, others, theories, claim, that, it, is, a, derivative, of, chontal, tabascan, word, yokat, an, meaning, speaker, of, the, yoko, ochoco, language, or, an, incorrect, nahuatl, term, yokatlan, as, supposedly, place, of, richness, yohc, uh, cannot, be, paired, with, tl, n, the, yucat, n, peninsula, is, the, site, of, the, chicxulub, crater, impact, which, was, created, 66, million, years, ago, by, an, asteroid, of, about, 10, to, 15, kilometers, 6, to, 9, miles, in, diameter, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, in, 2020, an, underwater, archaeological, expedition, led, by, jer, nimo, avil, s, excavated, chan, hol, cave, near, the, tulum, archaeological, site, in, the, state, of, quintana, roo, on, the, peninsula, and, revealed, the, skeleton, of, a, woman, approximately, 30, years, of, age, who, lived, at, least, 9, 900, years, ago, according, to, craniometric, measurements, the, skull, is, believed, to, conform, to, the, mesocephalic, pattern, like, the, other, three, skulls, found, in, tulum, caves, three, different, scars, on, the, skull, of, the, woman, showed, that, she, was, hit, with, something, hard, and, her, skull, bones, were, broken, her, skull, also, had, crater, like, deformations, and, tissue, deformities, that, appeared, to, be, caused, by, a, bacterial, relative, of, syphilis, according, to, study, lead, researcher, wolfgang, stinnesbeck, it, really, looks, as, if, this, woman, had, a, very, hard, time, and, an, extremely, unhappy, end, of, her, life, obviously, this, is, speculative, but, given, the, traumas, and, the, pathological, deformations, on, her, skull, it, appears, a, likely, scenario, that, she, may, have, been, expelled, from, her, group, and, was, killed, in, the, cave, or, was, left, in, the, cave, to, die, there, the, newly, discovered, skeleton, was, 140, meters, away, from, the, chan, hol, 2, site, although, archaeologists, assumed, the, divers, had, found, the, remains, of, the, missing, chan, hol, 2, the, analysis, soon, proved, that, these, assumptions, were, erroneous, stinnesbeck, compared, the, new, bones, to, old, photographs, of, chan, hol, 2, and, showed, that, the, two, skeletons, represent, different, individuals, due, to, their, distinctive, features, study, co, researcher, samuel, rennie, suggest, the, existence, of, at, least, two, morphologically, diverse, groups, of, people, living, separately, in, mexico, during, the, transition, from, pleistocene, to, holocene, the, yucat, n, peninsula, constitutes, a, significant, proportion, of, the, ancient, maya, lowlands, and, was, the, central, location, of, the, maya, civilization, the, maya, culture, also, extended, south, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, into, guatemala, honduras, and, the, highlands, of, chiapas, there, are, many, maya, archaeological, sites, throughout, the, peninsula, some, of, the, better, known, are, chichen, itza, coba, tulum, and, uxmal, indigenous, maya, and, mestizos, of, partial, maya, descent, make, up, a, sizable, portion, of, the, region, s, population, and, mayan, languages, are, widely, spoken, there, the, peninsula, is, the, exposed, portion, of, the, larger, yucat, n, platform, all, of, which, is, composed, of, carbonate, and, soluble, rocks, being, mostly, limestone, although, dolomite, and, evaporites, are, also, present, at, various, depths, the, whole, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, is, an, unconfined, flat, lying, karst, landscape, sinkholes, known, locally, as, cenotes, are, widespread, in, the, northern, lowlands, according, to, the, alvarez, hypothesis, the, mass, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, at, the, transition, from, the, cretaceous, to, the, paleogene, period, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, k, pg, boundary, 66, million, years, ago, was, caused, by, an, asteroid, impact, somewhere, in, the, greater, caribbean, basin, the, deeply, buried, chicxulub, crater, is, centered, off, the, north, coast, of, the, peninsula, near, the, town, of, chicxulub, the, now, famous, ring, of, cenotes, a, geologic, structure, composed, of, sinkholes, arranged, in, a, semi, circle, outlines, one, of, the, shock, waves, from, this, impact, event, in, the, approximately, 66, million, year, old, rock, the, existence, of, the, crater, has, been, supported, by, evidence, including, the, aforementioned, ring, of, cenotes, as, well, as, the, presence, of, impact, debris, such, as, shocked, quartz, and, tektites, a, type, of, glass, formed, during, meteorite, impacts, the, arrowsmith, bank, is, a, submerged, bank, located, off, the, northeastern, end, of, the, peninsula, the, peninsula, has, a, tropical, climate, which, ranges, from, semi, arid, in, the, northwest, to, humid, in, the, south, average, annual, rainfall, ranges, from, less, than, 800, mm, 30, inches, in, the, driest, parts, of, the, northwest, up, to, 2, 000, mm, 80, inches, in, the, pet, n, basin, to, the, south, rainfall, varies, seasonally, with, august, and, september, generally, the, wettest, months, like, much, of, the, caribbean, the, peninsula, lies, within, the, atlantic, hurricane, belt, and, with, its, almost, uniformly, flat, terrain, it, is, vulnerable, to, these, large, storms, coming, from, the, east, and, the, area, has, been, devastated, by, many, hurricanes, such, as, hurricane, gilbert, hurricane, emily, hurricane, wilma, and, hurricane, dean, strong, storms, called, nortes, can, quickly, descend, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, any, time, of, year, although, these, storms, pummel, the, area, with, heavy, rains, and, high, winds, they, tend, to, be, short, lived, clearing, after, about, an, hour, the, average, percentage, of, days, with, rain, per, month, ranges, from, a, monthly, low, of, 7, in, april, to, a, high, of, 25, in, october, breezes, can, have, a, cooling, effect, humidity, is, generally, high, particularly, in, the, remaining, rainforest, areas, due, to, the, extreme, karst, nature, of, the, whole, peninsula, the, northern, half, is, devoid, of, aboveground, rivers, where, lakes, and, swamps, are, present, the, water, is, marshy, and, generally, unpotable, due, to, its, coastal, location, the, whole, of, the, peninsula, is, underlain, by, an, extensive, contiguous, density, stratified, coastal, aquifer, where, a, fresh, water, lens, formed, from, meteoric, water, floats, on, top, of, intruding, saline, water, from, the, coastal, margins, the, thousands, of, sinkholes, known, as, cenotes, throughout, the, region, provide, access, to, the, groundwater, system, the, cenotes, have, long, been, relied, on, by, ancient, and, contemporary, maya, people, the, vegetation, and, plant, communities, of, the, peninsula, vary, from, north, to, south, the, yucat, n, dry, forests, occupy, the, dry, northwestern, peninsula, and, include, dry, forests, and, scrublands, and, cactus, scrub, the, yucat, n, moist, forests, occur, across, the, middle, and, east, of, the, peninsula, and, are, characterized, by, semi, deciduous, forests, where, 25, to, 50, of, the, trees, lose, their, leaves, during, the, summer, dry, season, the, belizian, pine, forests, are, found, in, several, enclaves, across, central, belize, the, southernmost, portion, of, the, peninsula, is, in, the, pet, n, veracruz, moist, forests, ecoregion, an, evergreen, rain, forest, northern, guatemala, el, pet, n, mexico, campeche, and, quintana, roo, and, western, belize, are, still, occupied, by, the, largest, continuous, tracts, of, tropical, rainforest, in, central, america, however, these, forests, are, suffering, extensive, deforestation, mangroves, occur, along, the, coast, with, the, usumacinta, mangroves, around, the, laguna, de, t, rminos, in, the, southwest, the, petenes, mangroves, along, the, west, coast, r, a, lagartos, mangroves, along, the, northern, shore, of, the, peninsula, and, the, mayan, corridor, mangroves, and, belizean, coast, mangroves, to, the, east, along, the, caribbean, sea, the, mesoamerican, barrier, reef, system, is, an, immense, coral, barrier, reef, which, stretches, over, 1, 100, km, 700, miles, along, the, eastern, coast, of, the, peninsula, the, peninsula, comprises, the, mexican, states, of, yucat, n, campeche, and, quintana, roo, as, well, as, guatemala, s, pet, n, department, and, almost, all, of, belize, in, the, late, historic, and, early, modern, eras, the, yucat, n, peninsula, was, largely, a, cattle, ranching, logging, chicle, and, henequen, production, area, since, the, 1970s, the, yucat, n, peninsula, has, reoriented, its, economy, towards, tourism, especially, in, the, mexican, state, of, quintana, roo, aside, from, tourism, another, source, of, income, that, is, important, in, the, peninsula, is, logging, as, well, as, chicle, industries, specifically, in, belize, oil, was, also, found, in, certain, parts, of, the, yucat, n, bringing, in, more, economic, opportunities, once, a, small, fishing, village, canc, n, in, the, northeast, of, the, peninsula, has, grown, into, a, thriving, city, the, riviera, maya, which, stretches, along, the, east, coast, of, the, peninsula, between, canc, n, and, tulum, houses, over, 50, 000, beds, the, best, known, locations, are, the, former, fishing, town, of, playa, del, carmen, the, ecological, parks, xcaret, and, xel, h, and, the, maya, ruins, of, tulum, and, coba, the, population, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, is, very, different, throughout, each, part, of, the, peninsula, population, density, and, ethnic, composition, are, two, factors, that, play, into, the, total, population, the, most, populated, area, is, m, rida, in, yucat, n, state, and, the, surrounding, region, contrasted, by, the, state, of, quintana, roo, the, least, populated, part, of, the, peninsula, in, terms, of, ethnic, composition, a, majority, of, the, population, consisted, of, both, maya, and, mestizos
