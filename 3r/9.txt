constant, regularity, from, the, 30, of, latitude, south, when, the, isotherms, tend, more, and, more, to, be, confused, with, the, degrees, of, latitude, in, temperate, latitudes, winters, and, summers, are, milder, than, in, north, america, this, is, because, the, most, extensive, part, of, the, continent, is, in, the, equatorial, zone, the, region, has, more, areas, of, equatorial, plains, than, any, other, region, therefore, giving, the, southern, cone, more, oceanic, influence, which, moderates, year, round, temperatures, the, average, annual, temperatures, in, the, amazon, basin, oscillate, around, 27, c, 81, f, with, low, thermal, amplitudes, and, high, rainfall, indices, between, the, maracaibo, lake, and, the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, predominates, an, equatorial, climate, of, the, type, congolese, that, also, includes, parts, of, the, brazilian, territory, the, east, central, brazilian, plateau, has, a, humid, and, warm, tropical, climate, the, northern, and, eastern, parts, of, the, argentine, pampas, have, a, humid, subtropical, climate, with, dry, winters, and, humid, summers, of, the, chinese, type, while, the, western, and, eastern, ranges, have, a, subtropical, climate, of, the, dinaric, type, at, the, highest, points, of, the, andean, region, climates, are, colder, than, the, ones, occurring, at, the, highest, point, of, the, norwegian, fjords, in, the, andean, plateaus, the, warm, climate, prevails, although, it, is, tempered, by, the, altitude, while, in, the, coastal, strip, there, is, an, equatorial, climate, of, the, guinean, type, from, this, point, until, the, north, of, the, chilean, coast, appear, successively, mediterranean, oceanic, climate, temperate, of, the, breton, type, and, already, in, tierra, del, fuego, cold, climate, of, the, siberian, type, the, distribution, of, rainfall, is, related, to, the, regime, of, winds, and, air, masses, in, most, of, the, tropical, region, east, of, the, andes, winds, blowing, from, the, northeast, east, and, southeast, carry, moisture, from, the, atlantic, causing, abundant, rainfall, however, due, to, a, consistently, strong, wind, shear, and, a, weak, intertropical, convergence, zone, south, atlantic, tropical, cyclones, are, rare, in, the, orinoco, llanos, and, in, the, guianas, plateau, the, precipitation, levels, go, from, moderate, to, high, the, pacific,

moderately, dry, conditions, of, the, chaco, oppose, the, intense, rainfall, of, the, eastern, region, of, paraguay, in, the, semiarid, coast, of, the, brazilian, northeast, the, rains, are, linked, to, a, monsoon, regime, important, factors, in, the, determination, of, climates, are, sea, currents, such, as, the, current, humboldt, and, falklands, the, equatorial, current, of, the, south, atlantic, strikes, the, coast, of, the, northeast, and, there, is, divided, into, two, others, the, current, of, brazil, and, a, coastal, current, that, flows, to, the, northwest, towards, the, antilles, where, there, it, moves, towards, northeast, course, thus, forming, the, most, important, and, famous, ocean, current, in, the, world, the, gulf, stream, south, america, is, one, of, the, most, biodiverse, continents, on, earth, it, is, home, to, many, unique, species, of, animals, including, the, llama, anaconda, piranha, jaguar, vicu, a, and, tapir, and, to, one, of, the, largest, known, insects, in, the, world, the, titan, beetle, the, amazon, rainforests, possess, high, biodiversity, with, brazil, estimated, to, contain, 10, of, earth, s, species, 83, of, south, america, s, large, mammals, megafauna, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, around, 11, 000, years, ago, as, part, of, the, quaternary, extinction, event, among, the, highest, of, any, continent, with, the, casualties, including, saber, toothed, cats, ground, sloths, glyptodonts, gomphotheres, the, equines, hippidion, and, equus, neogeus, and, all, remaining, south, american, native, ungulates, south, america, is, thought, to, have, been, first, inhabited, by, humans, when, people, were, crossing, the, bering, land, bridge, now, the, bering, strait, at, least, 15, 000, years, ago, from, the, territory, that, is, present, day, russia, they, migrated, south, through, north, america, and, eventually, reached, south, america, through, the, isthmus, of, panama, amongst, the, oldest, evidence, for, human, presence, in, south, america, is, the, monte, verde, ii, site, in, chile, suggested, to, date, to, around, 14, 500, years, ago, from, around, 13, 000, years, ago, the, fishtail, projectile, point, style, became, widespread, across, south, america, with, its, disppearance, around, 11, 000, years, ago, coincident, with, the, disappearance, of, south, america, s, megafauna, maize, was, present, in, northern, south, america, by, around, 6, 000, years, ago, by, 2000, bc, many, agrarian, communities, had, been, settled, throughout, the, andes, and, the, surrounding, regions, fishing, became, a, widespread, practice, along, the, coast, helping, establish, fish, as, a, primary, source, of, food, irrigation, systems, were, also, developed, at, this, time, which, aided, in, the, rise, of, an, agrarian, society, south, american, cultures, began, domesticating, llamas, vicu, as, guanacos, and, alpacas, in, the, highlands, of, the, andes, circa, 3500, bc, besides, their, use, as, sources, of, meat, and, wool, these, animals, were, used, for, transportation, of, goods, the, rise, of, plant, growing, and, the, subsequent, appearance, of, permanent, human, settlements, allowed, for, the, multiple, and, overlapping, beginnings, of, civilizations, in, south, america, one, of, the, earliest, known, south, american, civilizations, was, at, caral, supe, on, the, central, peruvian, coast, though, a, pre, ceramic, culture, the, monumental, architecture, of, caral, supe, created, one, of, the, first, cities, of, the, world, generally, dated, to, around, 3500, bc, at, huaricanga, in, the, fortaleza, area, contemporaneous, with, the, pyramids, of, ancient, egypt, one, of, the, oldest, known, civilizations, in, the, americas, and, one, of, the, six, sites, where, civilization, separately, originated, in, the, ancient, world, caral, supe, governing, class, established, a, trade, network, and, developed, agriculture, then, followed, by, chav, n, by, 900, bc, according, to, some, estimates, and, archaeological, finds, artifacts, were, found, at, a, site, called, chav, n, de, huantar, in, modern, peru, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 177, meters, 10, 423, ft, chav, n, civilization, spanned, 900, bc, to, 300, bc, in, the, central, coast, of, peru, around, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, ad, moche, 100, bc, 700, ad, at, the, northern, coast, of, peru, paracas, and, nazca, 400, bc, 800, ad, peru, cultures, flourished, with, centralized, states, with, permanent, militia, improving, agriculture, through, irrigation, and, new, styles,

the, muisca, were, the, main, indigenous, civilization, in, what, is, now, colombia, they, established, the, muisca, confederation, of, many, clans, or, cacicazgos, that, had, a, free, trade, network, among, themselves, many, were, goldsmiths, and, farmers, other, important, pre, columbian, cultures, include, the, ca, aris, in, south, central, ecuador, chim, empire, 1300, 1470, peruvian, northern, coast, chachapoyas, and, the, aymaran, kingdoms, 1000, 1450, western, bolivia, and, southern, peru, holding, their, capital, at, the, great, city, of, cusco, the, inca, civilization, dominated, the, andes, region, from, 1438, to, 1533, known, as, tawantin, suyu, and, the, land, of, the, four, regions, in, quechua, the, inca, empire, was, highly, distinct, and, developed, inca, rule, extended, to, nearly, a, hundred, linguistic, or, ethnic, communities, some, nine, to, fourteen, million, people, connected, by, a, 25, 000, kilometer, road, system, cities, were, built, with, precise, unmatched, stonework, constructed, over, many, levels, of, mountain, terrain, terrace, farming, was, a, useful, form, of, agriculture, the, mapuche, in, central, and, southern, chile, resisted, the, european, and, chilean, settlers, waging, the, arauco, war, for, more, than, 300, years, in, 1494, portugal, and, spain, the, two, great, maritime, european, powers, of, that, time, on, the, expectation, of, new, lands, being, discovered, in, the, west, signed, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, by, which, they, agreed, with, the, support, of, the, pope, that, all, the, land, outside, europe, should, be, an, exclusive, duopoly, between, the, two, countries, the, treaty, established, an, imaginary, line, along, a, north, south, meridian, 370, leagues, west, of, the, cape, verde, islands, roughly, 46, 37, w, in, terms, of, the, treaty, all, land, to, the, west, of, the, line, known, to, comprise, most, of, the, south, american, soil, would, belong, to, spain, and, all, land, to, the, east, to, portugal, as, accurate, measurements, of, longitude, were, impossible, at, that, time, the, line, was, not, strictly, enforced, resulting, in, a, portuguese, expansion, of, brazil, across, the, meridian, beginning, in, the, 1530s, the, people, and, natural, resources, of, south, america, were, repeatedly, exploited, by, foreign, conquistadors, first, from, spain, and, later, from, portugal, these, competing, colonial, nations, claimed, the, land, and, resources, as, their, own, and, divided, it, into, colonies, european, infectious, diseases, smallpox, influenza, measles, and, typhus, to, which, the, native, populations, had, no, immune, resistance, caused, large, scale, depopulation, of, the, native, population, under, spanish, control, systems, of, forced, labor, such, as, the, haciendas, and, mining, industry, s, mit, a, also, contributed, to, the, depopulation, after, this, enslaved, africans, who, had, developed, immunities, to, these, diseases, were, quickly, brought, in, to, replace, them, the, spaniards, were, committed, to, converting, their, native, subjects, to, christianity, and, were, quick, to, purge, any, native, cultural, practices, that, hindered, this, end, however, many, initial, attempts, at, this, were, only, partially, successful, as, native, groups, simply, blended, catholicism, with, their, established, beliefs, and, practices, furthermore, the, spaniards, brought, their, language, to, the, degree, they, did, with, their, religion, although, the, roman, catholic, church, s, evangelization, in, quechua, aymara, and, guaran, actually, contributed, to, the, continuous, use, of, these, native, languages, albeit, only, in, the, oral, form, eventually, the, natives, and, the, spaniards, interbred, forming, a, mestizo, class, at, the, beginning, many, mestizos, of, the, andean, region, were, offspring, of, amerindian, mothers, and, spanish, fathers, after, independence, most, mestizos, had, native, fathers, and, european, or, mestizo, mothers, many, native, artworks, were, considered, pagan, idols, and, destroyed, by, spanish, explorers, this, included, many, gold, and, silver, sculptures, and, other, artifacts, found, in, south, america, which, were, melted, down, before, their, transport, to, spain, or, portugal, spaniards, and, portuguese, brought, the, western, european, architectural, style, to, the, continent, and, helped, to, improve, infrastructures, like, bridges, roads, and, the, sewer, system, of, the, cities, they, discovered, or, conquered, they, also, significantly, increased, economic, and, trade, relations, not, just, between, the, old, and, new, world, but, between, the, different, south, american, regions, and, peoples, finally, with, the, expansion, of, the, portuguese, and, spanish, languages, many, cultures, that, were, previously, separated, became, united, through, that, of, latin, american, guyana, was, initially, colonized, by, the, dutch, before, coming, under, british, control, though, there, was, a, brief, period, during, the, napoleonic, wars, when, it, was, occupied, by, the, french, the, region, was, initially, partitioned, between, the, dutch, french, and, british, before, fully, coming, under, the, control, of, britain, suriname, was, first, explored, by, the, spanish, in, the, 16th, century, and, then, settled, by, the, english, in, the, mid, 17th, century, it, became, a, dutch, colony, in, 1667, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, in, various, european, colonies, were, forced, to, work, in, european, plantations, and, mines, along, with, enslaved, africans, who, were, also, introduced, in, the, proceeding, centuries, via, the, slave, trade, european, colonists, were, heavily, dependent, on, indigenous, labor, during, the, initial, phases, of, settlement, to, maintain, the, subsistence, economy, and, natives, were, often, captured, by, expeditions, the, importation, of, african, slaves, began, midway, through, the, 16th, century, but, the, enslavement, of, indigenous, peoples, continued, well, into, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, atlantic, slave, trade, brought, enslaved, africans, primarily, to, south, american, colonies, beginning, with, the, portuguese, since, 1502, the, main, destinations, of, this, phase, were, the, caribbean, colonies, and, brazil, as, european, nations, built, up, economically, slave, dependent, colonies, in, the, new, world, nearly, 40, of, all, african, slaves, trafficked, to, the, americas, went, to, brazil, an, estimated, 4, 9, million, slaves, from, africa, came, to, brazil, during, the, period, from, 1501, to, 1866, in, contrast, to, other, european, colonies, in, the, americas, which, mainly, used, the, labor, of, african, slaves, spanish, colonists, mainly, enslaved, indigenous, americans, in, 1750, the, portuguese, crown, abolished, the, enslavement, of, indigenous, peoples, in, colonial, brazil, under, the, belief, that, they, were, unfit, for, labor, and, less, effective, than, enslaved, africans, enslaved, africans, were, brought, to, the, americas, on, slave, ships, under, inhuman, conditions, and, ill, treatment, and, those, who, survived, were, sold, in, slave, markets, after, independence, all, south, american, countries, maintained, slavery, for, some, time, the, first, south, american, country, to, abolish, slavery, was, chile, in, 1823, uruguay, in, 1830, bolivia, in, 1831, guyana, in, 1833, colombia, and, ecuador, in, 1851, argentina, in, 1853, peru, and, venezuela, in, 1854, suriname, in, 1863, paraguay, in, 1869, and, in, 1888, brazil, was, the, last, south, american, nation, and, the, last, country, in, western, world, to, abolish, slavery, the, european, peninsular, war, 1807, 14, a, theater, of, the, napoleonic, wars, changed, the, political, situation, of, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonies, first, napoleon, invaded, portugal, but, the, house, of, braganza, avoided, capture, by, escaping, to, brazil, napoleon, captured, king, ferdinand, vii, of, spain, and, appointed, his, own, brother, instead, this, appointment, provoked, popular, resistance, which, created, juntas, to, rule, in, the, name, of, the, captured, king, many, cities, in, the, spanish, colonies, however, considered, themselves, equally, authorized, to, appoint, local, juntas, like, those, of, spain, this, began, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, between, the, patriots, who, promoted, such, autonomy, and, the, royalists, who, supported, spanish, authority, over, the, americas, the, juntas, in, both, spain, and, the, americas, promoted, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, five, years, after, the, beginning, of, the, war, ferdinand, vii, returned, to, the, throne, and, began, the, absolutist, restoration, as, the, royalists, got, the, upper, hand, in, the, conflict, the, independence, of, south, america, was, secured, by, sim, n, bol, var, venezuela, and, jos, de, san, mart, n, argentina, the, two, most, important, libertadores, bol, var, led, a, great, uprising, in, the, north, then, led, his, army, south, towards, lima, the, capital, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, meanwhile, san, mart, n, led, an, army, across, the, andes, mountains, along, with, chilean, expatriates, and, liberated, chile, he, organized, a, fleet, to, reach, peru, by, sea, and, sought, the, military, support, of, various, rebels, from, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, in, 1822, the, two, men, met, at, the, guayaquil, conference, in, ecuador, where, they, failed, to, agree, on, governance, strategies, for, the, liberated, nations, two, years, later, bol, var, s, forces, beat, the, spanish, at, the, battle, of, ayacucho, securing, the, independence, of, peru, and, the, rest, of, south, america, in, the, portuguese, kingdom, of, brazil, dom, pedro, i, also, pedro, iv, of, portugal, son, of, the, portuguese, king, dom, jo, o, vi, proclaimed, the, independent, kingdom, of, brazil, in, 1822, which, later, became, the, empire, of, brazil, despite, the, portuguese, loyalties, of, garrisons, in, bahia, cisplatina, and, par, independence, was, diplomatically, accepted, by, portugal, in, 1825, on, condition, of, a, high, compensation, paid, by, brazil, mediated, by, the, united, kingdom, the, newly, independent, nations, began, a, process, of, fragmentation, with, several, civil, and, international, wars, however, it, was, not, as, strong, as, in, central, america, some, countries, created, from, provinces, of, larger, countries, stayed, as, such, up, to, modern, times, such, as, paraguay, or, uruguay, while, others, were, reconquered, and, reincorporated, into, their, former, countries, such, as, the, republic, of, entre, r, os, and, the, riograndense, republic, the, first, separatist, attempt, was, in, 1820, by, the, argentine, province, of, entre, r, os, led, by, a, caudillo, in, spite, of, the, republic, in, its, title, general, ram, rez, its, caudillo, never, really, intended, to, declare, an, independent, entre, rios, rather, he, was, making, a, political, statement, in, opposition, to, the, monarchist, and, centralist, ideas, that, back, then, permeated, buenos, aires, politics, the, country, was, reincorporated, at, the, united, provinces, in, 1821, in, 1825, the, cisplatine, province, declared, its, independence, from, the, empire, of, brazil, which, led, to, the, cisplatine, war, between, the, imperials, and, the, argentine, from, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, to, control, the, region, three, years, later, the, united, kingdom, intervened, in, the, question, by, proclaiming, a, tie, and, creating, in, the, former, cisplatina, a, new, independent, country, the, oriental, republic, of, uruguay, later, in, 1836, while, brazil, was, experiencing, the, chaos, of, the, regency, rio, grande, do, sul, proclaimed, its, independence, motivated, by, a, tax, crisis, with, the, anticipation, of, the, coronation, of, pedro, ii, to, the, throne, of, brazil, the, country, could, stabilize, and, fight, the, separatists, which, the, province, of, santa, catarina, had, joined, in, 1839, the, conflict, came, to, an, end, by, a, process, of, compromise, by, which, both, riograndense, republic, and, juliana, republic, were, reincorporated, as, provinces, in, 1845, the, peru, bolivian, confederation, a, short, lived, union, of, peru, and, bolivia, was, blocked, by, chile, in, the, war, of, the, confederation, 1836, 39, and, again, during, the, war, of, the, pacific, 1879, 83, paraguay, was, virtually, destroyed, by, argentina, brazil, and, uruguay, in, the, paraguayan, war, despite, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, and, the, brazilian, war, of, independence, the, new, nations, quickly, began, to, suffer, with, internal, conflicts, and, wars, among, themselves, most, of, the, 1810, borders, countries, had, initially, accepted, on, the, uti, possidetis, iuris, principle, had, by, 1848, either, been, altered, by, war, or, were, contested, in, 1825, the, proclamation, of, independence, of, cisplatina, led, to, the, cisplatine, war, between, historical, rivals, the, empire, of, brazil, and, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, argentina, s, predecessor, the, result, was, a, stalemate, ending, with, the, british, government, arranging, for, the, independence, of, uruguay, soon, after, another, brazilian, province, proclaimed, its, independence, leading, to, the, ragamuffin, war, which, brazil, won, between, 1836, and, 1839, the, war, of, the, confederation, broke, out, between, the, short, lived, peru, bolivian, confederation, and, chile, with, the, support, of, the, argentine, confederation, the, war, was, fought, mostly, in, the, actual, territory, of, peru, and, ended, with, a, confederate, defeat, and, the, dissolution, of, the, confederacy, and, annexation, of, many, territories, by, argentina, meanwhile, the, argentine, civil, wars, plagued, argentina, since, its, independence, the, conflict, was, mainly, between, those, who, defended, the, centralization, of, power, in, buenos, aires, and, those, who, defended, a, confederation, during, this, period, it, can, be, said, that, there, were, two, argentines, the, argentine, confederation, and, the, argentine, republic, at, the, same, time, the, political, instability, in, uruguay, led, to, the, uruguayan, civil, war, among, the, main, political, factions, of, the, country, all, this, instability, in, the, platine, region, interfered, with, the, goals, of, other, countries, such, as, brazil, which, was, soon, forced, to, take, sides, in, 1851, the, brazilian, empire, supporting, the, centralizing, unitarians, and, the, uruguayan, government, invaded, argentina, and, deposed, the, caudillo, juan, manuel, rosas, who, ruled, the, confederation, with, an, iron, hand, although, the, platine, war, did, not, put, an, end, to, the, political, chaos, and, civil, war, in, argentina, it, brought, temporary, peace, to, uruguay, where, the, colorados, faction, won, supported, by, brazil, britain, france, and, the, unitarian, party, of, argentina, peace, lasted, only, a, short, time, in, 1864, the, uruguayan, factions, faced, each, other, again, in, the, uruguayan, war, the, blancos, supported, by, paraguay, started, to, attack, brazilian, and, argentine, farmers, near, the, borders, the, empire, made, an, initial, attempt, to, settle, the, dispute, between, blancos, and, colorados, without, success, in, 1864, after, a, brazilian, ultimatum, was, refused, the, imperial, government, declared, that, brazil, s, military, would, begin, reprisals, brazil, declined, to, acknowledge, a, formal, state, of, war, and, for, most, of, its, duration, the, uruguayan, brazilian, armed, conflict, was, an, undeclared, war, which, led, to, the, deposition, of, the, blancos, and, the, rise, of, the, pro, brazilian, colorados, to, power, again, this, angered, the, paraguayan, government, which, even, before, the, end, of, the, war, invaded, brazil, beginning, the, longest, and, bloodiest, inter, state, war, in, latin, american, history, the, paraguayan, war, the,

to, cross, argentinian, territory, without, argentinian, approval, led, the, pro, brazilian, argentine, government, into, the, war, the, pro, brazilian, uruguayan, government, showed, its, support, by, sending, troops, in, 1865, the, three, countries, signed, the, treaty, of, the, triple, alliance, against, paraguay, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, paraguayans, took, the, lead, with,

civil, war, it, was, deemed, the, greatest, war, effort, in, the, history, of, all, participating, countries, taking, almost, 6, years, and, ending, with, the, complete, devastation, of, paraguay, the, country, lost, 40, of, its, territory, to, brazil, and, argentina, and, lost, 60, of, its, population, including, 90, of, the, men, the, dictator, lopez, was, killed, in, battle, and, a, new,
