in, urban, planning, zoning, is, a, method, in, which, a, municipality, or, other, tier, of, government, divides, land, into, zones, each, of, which, has, a, set, of, regulations, for, new, development, that, differs, from, other, zones, zones, may, be, defined, for, a, single, use, e, g, residential, industrial, they, may, combine, several, compatible, activities, by, use, or, in, the, case, of, form, based, zoning, the, differing, regulations, may, govern, the, density, size, and, shape, of, allowed, buildings, whatever, their, use, the, planning, rules, for, each, zone, determine, whether, planning, permission, for, a, given, development, may, be, granted, zoning, may, specify, a, variety, of, outright, and, conditional, uses, of, land, it, may, indicate, the, size, and, dimensions, of, lots, that, land, may, be, subdivided, into, or, the, form, and, scale, of, buildings, these, guidelines, are, set, in, order, to, guide, urban, growth, and, development, zoning, is, the, most, common, regulatory, urban, planning, method, used, by, local, governments, in, developed, countries, exceptions, include, the, united, kingdom, and, the, city, of, houston, texas, most, zoning, systems, have, a, procedure, for, granting, variances, exceptions, to, the, zoning, rules, usually, because, of, some, perceived, hardship, caused, by, the, particular, nature, of, the, property, in, question, the, origins, of, zoning, districts, can, be, traced, back, to, antiquity, the, ancient, walled, city, was, the, predecessor, for, classifying, and, regulating, land, based, on, use, outside, the, city, walls, were, the, undesirable, functions, which, were, usually, based, on, noise, and, smell, the, space, between, the, walls, is, where, unsanitary, and, dangerous, activities, occurred, such, as, butchering, waste, disposal, and, brick, firing, within, the, walls, were, civic, and, religious, places, and, where, the, majority, of, people, lived, beyond, distinguishing, between, urban, and, non, urban, land, most, ancient, cities, further, classified, land, types, and, uses, inside, their, walls, this, was, practiced, in, many, regions, of, the, world, for, example, in, china, during, the, zhou, dynasty, 1046, 256, bc, in, india, during, the, vedic, era, 1500, 500, bc, and, in, the, military, camps, that, spread, throughout, the, roman, empire, 31, bc, 476, ad, throughout, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, industrial, revolution, cultural, and, socio, economic, shifts, led, to, the, rapid, increase, in, the, enforcement, and, invention, of, urban, regulations, the, shifts, were, informed, by, a, new, scientific, rationality, the, advent, of, mass, production, and, complex, manufacturing, and, the, subsequent, onset, of, urbanisation, industry, leaving, the, home, reshaped, modern, cities, the, definition, of, home, was, tied, to, the, definition, of, economy, which, caused, a, much, greater, mixing, of, uses, within, the, residential, quarters, of, cities, separation, between, uses, is, a, feature, of, many, planned, cities, designed, before, the, advent, of, zoning, a, notable, example, is, adelaide, in, south, australia, whose, city, centre, along, with, the, suburb, of, north, adelaide, is, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, a, park, the, adelaide, park, lands, the, park, was, designed, by, colonel, william, light, in, 1836, in, order, to, physically, separate, the, city, centre, from, its, suburbs, low, density, residential, areas, surround, the, park, providing, a, pleasant, walk, between, work, in, the, city, within, and, the, family, homes, outside, sir, ebenezer, howard, founder, of, the, garden, city, movement, cited, adelaide, as, an, example, of, how, green, open, space, could, be, used, to, prevent, cities, from, expanding, beyond, their, boundaries, and, coalescing, 94, his, design, for, an, ideal, city, published, in, his, 1902, book, garden, cities, of, to, morrow, envisaged, separate, concentric, rings, of, public, buildings, parks, retail, space, residential, areas, and, industrial, areas, all, surrounded, by, open, space, and, farmland, all, retail, activity, was, to, be, conducted, within, a, single, glass, roofed, building, an, early, concept, for, the, modern, shopping, centre, inspired, by, the, crystal, palace, 4, however, these, planned, or, ideal, cities, were, static, designs, embodied, in, a, single, masterplan, what, was, lacking, was, a, regulatory, mechanism, to, allow, the, city, to, develop, over, time, setting, guidelines, to, developers, and, private, citizens, over, what, could, be, built, where, the, first, modern, zoning, systems, were, applied, in, the, united, states, with, the, los, angeles, zoning, ordinances, of, 1904, and, the, new, york, city, 1916, zoning, resolution, there, are, a, great, variety, of, zoning, types, some, of, which, focus, on, regulating, building, form, and, the, relation, of, buildings, to, the, street, with, mixed, uses, known, as, form, based, others, with, separating, land, uses, known, as, use, based, or, a, combination, thereof, use, based, zoning, systems, can, comprise, single, use, zones, mixed, use, zones, where, a, compatible, group, of, uses, are, allowed, to, co, exist, or, a, combination, of, both, single, and, mixed, use, zones, in, one, system, the, main, approaches, include, use, based, form, based, performance, and, incentive, zoning, there, are, also, several, additional, zoning, provisions, used, in, combination, with, the, main, approaches, use, based, or, functional, zoning, systems, can, comprise, single, use, zones, mixed, use, zones, where, a, compatible, group, of, uses, are, allowed, to, co, exist, or, a, combination, of, both, single, and, mixed, use, zones, in, one, system, the, primary, purpose, of, single, use, zoning, is, to, geographically, separate, uses, that, are, thought, to, be, incompatible, in, practice, zoning, is, also, used, to, prevent, new, development, from, interfering, with, existing, uses, and, or, to, preserve, the, character, of, a, community, single, use, zoning, is, where, only, one, kind, of, use, is, allowed, per, zone, or, district, it, is, also, known, as, exclusionary, zoning, 65, or, in, the, united, states, as, euclidean, zoning, because, of, a, court, case, in, euclid, ohio, village, of, euclid, ohio, v, ambler, realty, co, 272, u, s, 365, 1926, which, established, its, constitutionality, it, has, been, the, dominant, system, of, zoning, in, north, america, especially, the, united, states, since, its, first, implementation, 61, 63, commonly, defined, single, use, districts, include, residential, commercial, and, industrial, each, category, can, have, a, number, of, sub, categories, for, example, within, the, commercial, category, there, may, be, separate, districts, for, small, retail, large, retail, office, use, lodging, and, others, while, industrial, may, be, subdivided, into, heavy, manufacturing, light, assembly, and, warehouse, uses, special, districts, may, also, be, created, for, purposes, like, public, facilities, recreational, amenities, and, green, space, the, application, of, single, use, zoning, has, led, to, the, distinctive, form, of, many, cities, in, the, united, states, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, in, which, a, very, dense, urban, core, often, containing, skyscrapers, is, surrounded, by, low, density, residential, suburbs, characterised, by, large, gardens, and, leafy, streets, some, metropolitan, areas, such, as, minneapolis, saint, paul, and, sydney, have, several, such, cores, mixed, use, zoning, combines, residential, commercial, office, and, public, uses, into, a, single, space, mixed, use, zoning, can, be, vertical, within, a, single, building, or, horizontal, involving, multiple, buildings, planning, and, community, activist, jane, jacobs, wrote, extensively, on, the, connections, between, the, separation, of, uses, and, the, failure, of, urban, renewal, projects, in, new, york, city, she, advocated, dense, mixed, use, developments, and, walkable, streets, in, contrast, to, villages, and, towns, in, which, many, residents, know, one, another, and, low, density, outer, suburbs, that, attract, few, visitors, cities, and, inner, city, areas, have, the, problem, of, maintaining, order, between, strangers, 26, 39, 44, this, order, is, maintained, when, throughout, the, day, and, evening, there, are, sufficient, people, present, with, eyes, on, the, street, 45, 65, this, can, be, accomplished, in, successful, urban, districts, that, have, a, great, diversity, of, uses, creating, interest, and, attracting, visitors, 155, 190, jacobs, writings, along, with, increasing, concerns, about, urban, sprawl, are, often, credited, with, inspiring, the, new, urbanism, movement, to, accommodate, the, new, urbanist, vision, of, walkable, communities, combining, caf, s, restaurants, offices, and, residential, development, in, a, single, area, mixed, use, zones, have, been, created, within, some, zoning, systems, these, still, use, the, basic, regulatory, mechanisms, of, zoning, excluding, incompatible, uses, such, as, heavy, industry, or, sewage, farms, while, allowing, compatible, uses, such, as, residential, commercial, and, retail, activities, so, that, people, can, live, work, and, socialise, within, a, compact, geographic, area, the, mixing, of, land, uses, is, common, throughout, the, world, mixed, use, zoning, has, particular, relevance, in, the, united, states, where, it, is, proposed, as, a, remedy, to, the, problems, caused, by, widespread, single, use, zoning, form, based, or, intensity, zoning, regulates, not, the, type, of, land, use, but, the, form, that, land, use, may, take, for, instance, form, based, zoning, in, a, dense, area, may, insist, on, low, setbacks, high, density, and, pedestrian, accessibility, form, based, codes, fbcs, are, designed, to, directly, respond, to, the, physical, structure, of, a, community, in, order, to, create, more, walkable, and, adaptable, environments, form, based, zoning, codes, have, five, main, elements, a, regulating, plan, public, standards, building, standards, and, precise, definitions, of, technical, terms, form, based, codes, recognize, the, interrelated, nature, of, all, components, of, land, use, planning, zoning, subdivision, and, public, works, and, integrate, them, to, define, districts, based, on, the, community, s, desired, character, and, intensity, of, development, the, french, planning, system, is, mostly, form, based, zones, in, french, cities, generally, allow, many, types, of, uses, the, city, of, paris, has, used, its, zoning, system, to, concentrate, high, density, office, buildings, in, the, district, of, la, d, fense, rather, than, allow, heritage, buildings, across, the, city, to, be, demolished, to, make, way, for, them, as, is, often, the, case, in, london, or, new, york, the, construction, of, the, montparnasse, tower, in, 1973, led, to, an, outcry, as, a, result, two, years, after, its, completion, the, construction, of, buildings, over, seven, storeys, high, in, the, city, centre, was, banned, performance, zoning, also, known, as, flexible, or, impact, zoning, or, effects, based, planning, was, first, advocated, by, lane, kendig, in, 1973, it, uses, performance, based, or, goal, oriented, criteria, to, establish, review, parameters, for, proposed, development, projects, 77, performance, zoning, may, use, a, menu, of, compliance, options, where, a, property, developer, can, earn, points, or, credits, for, limiting, environmental, impacts, including, affordable, housing, units, or, providing, public, amenities, in, addition, to, the, menu, and, points, system, there, may, be, additional, discretionary, criteria, included, in, the, review, process, performance, zoning, may, be, applied, only, to, a, specific, type, of, development, such, as, housing, and, may, be, combined, with, a, system, of, use, based, districts, performance, zoning, is, flexible, logical, and, transparent, while, offering, a, form, of, accountability, these, qualities, are, in, contrast, with, the, seemingly, arbitrary, nature, of, use, based, zoning, performance, zoning, can, also, fairly, balance, a, region, s, environmental, and, housing, needs, across, local, jurisdictions, performance, zoning, balances, principles, of, markets, and, private, property, rights, with, environmental, protection, goals, however, performance, zoning, can, be, extremely, difficult, to, implement, due, to, the, complexity, of, preparing, an, impact, study, for, each, project, 77, and, can, require, the, supervising, authority, to, exercise, a, lot, of, discretion, performance, zoning, has, not, been, adopted, widely, in, the, us, incentive, zoning, allows, property, developers, to, develop, land, more, intensively, such, as, with, greater, density, or, taller, buildings, in, exchange, for, providing, some, public, benefits, such, as, environmental, amenities, or, affordable, housing, units, the, public, benefits, most, often, incentivised, by, us, cities, are, mixed, use, development, open, space, conservation, walkability, affordable, housing, and, public, parks, incentive, zoning, allows, for, a, high, degree, of, flexibility, but, may, be, complex, to, administer, the, more, a, proposed, development, takes, advantage, of, incentive, criteria, the, more, closely, it, has, to, be, reviewed, on, a, discretionary, basis, the, initial, creation, of, the, incentive, structure, in, order, to, best, serve, planning, priorities, also, may, be, challenging, and, often, requires, extensive, ongoing, revision, to, maintain, balance, between, incentive, magnitude, and, value, given, to, developers, incentive, zoning, may, be, most, effective, in, communities, with, well, established, standards, and, where, demand, for, both, land, and, for, specific, amenities, is, high, however, hidden, costs, may, still, offset, its, benefits, incentive, zoning, has, also, been, criticized, for, increasing, traffic, reducing, natural, light, and, offering, developers, larger, rewards, than, those, reaped, by, the, public, additional, zoning, provisions, exist, that, are, not, their, own, distinct, types, of, zoning, but, seek, to, improve, existing, varieties, through, the, incorporation, of, flexible, practices, and, other, elements, such, as, information, and, communication, technologies, icts, smart, zoning, is, a, broad, term, that, consists, of, several, alternatives, to, use, based, zoning, that, incorporate, information, and, communication, technologies, there, are, a, number, of, different, techniques, to, accomplish, smart, zoning, floating, zones, cluster, zoning, and, planned, unit, developments, puds, are, possible, even, as, the, conventional, use, based, code, exists, or, the, conventional, code, may, be, completely, replaced, by, a, smart, performance, or, form, based, code, as, the, city, of, miami, did, in, 2019, the, incorporation, of, icts, to, measure, metrics, such, as, walkability, and, the, flexibility, and, adaptability, that, smart, zoning, can, provide, have, been, cited, as, advantages, of, smart, zoning, over, non, smart, performance, or, form, based, codes, floating, zones, describe, a, zoning, district, s, characteristics, and, codify, requirements, for, its, establishment, but, its, location, remains, unspecified, until, conditions, exist, to, implement, that, type, of, zoning, district, when, the, criteria, for, implementation, of, a, floating, zone, are, met, the, floating, zone, ceases, to, float, and, its, location, is, established, by, a, zoning, amendment, cluster, zoning, permits, residential, uses, to, be, clustered, more, closely, together, than, normally, allowed, thereby, leaving, substantial, land, area, to, be, devoted, to, open, space, cluster, zoning, has, been, favored, for, its, preservation, of, open, space, and, reduction, in, construction, and, utility, costs, via, consolidation, although, existing, residents, may, often, disapprove, due, to, a, reduction, in, lot, sizes, the, term, planned, unit, development, pud, can, refer, either, to, the, regulatory, process, or, to, the, development, itself, a, pud, groups, multiple, compatible, land, uses, within, a, single, unified, development, a, pud, can, be, residential, mixed, use, or, a, larger, master, planned, community, rather, than, being, governed, by, standard, zoning, ordinances, the, developer, negotiates, terms, with, the, local, government, at, best, a, pud, provides, flexibility, to, create, convenient, ways, for, residents, to, access, commercial, and, other, amenities, in, the, us, residents, of, a, pud, have, an, ongoing, role, in, management, of, the, development, through, a, homeowner, s, association, pattern, zoning, is, a, zoning, technique, in, which, a, municipality, provides, licensed, pre, approved, building, designs, typically, with, an, expedited, permitting, process, pattern, zoning, is, used, to, reduce, barriers, to, housing, development, create, more, affordable, housing, reduce, burdens, on, permit, review, staff, and, create, quality, housing, designs, within, a, certain, neighborhood, or, jurisdiction, pattern, zoning, may, also, be, used, to, promote, certain, building, types, such, as, missing, middle, housing, and, affordable, small, scale, commercial, properties, in, some, cases, a, municipality, purchases, design, patterns, and, constructs, the, properties, themselves, while, in, other, cases, the, municipality, offers, the, patterns, for, private, development, a, hybrid, zoning, code, combines, two, or, more, approaches, often, use, based, and, form, based, zoning, hybrid, zoning, can, be, used, to, introduce, form, and, design, considerations, into, an, existing, community, s, zoning, without, completely, rewriting, the, zoning, ordinance, composite, zoning, is, a, particular, type, of, hybrid, zoning, that, combines, use, form, and, site, design, components, an, advantage, of, composite, zoning, is, the, ability, to, create, flexible, zoning, districts, for, smoother, transitions, between, adjacent, properties, with, different, uses, inclusionary, zoning, refers, to, policies, to, increase, the, number, of, housing, units, within, a, development, that, are, affordable, to, low, and, middle, income, households, these, policies, can, be, mandatory, as, part, of, performance, zoning, or, based, on, voluntary, incentives, such, as, allowing, greater, density, of, development, an, overlay, zone, is, a, zoning, district, that, overlaps, one, or, more, zoning, districts, to, address, a, particular, concern, or, feature, of, that, area, such, as, wetlands, historic, buildings, or, transit, oriented, development, overlay, zoning, has, the, advantage, of, providing, targeted, regulation, to, address, a, specific, issue, such, as, a, natural, hazard, without, having, to, significantly, rewrite, an, existing, zoning, ordinance, however, development, of, overlay, zoning, regulation, often, requires, significant, technical, expertise, transferable, development, rights, also, known, as, transfer, of, development, credits, and, transferable, development, units, are, based, on, the, concept, that, with, land, ownership, comes, the, right, of, use, of, land, or, land, development, these, land, based, development, rights, can, in, some, jurisdictions, be, used, unused, sold, or, otherwise, transferred, by, the, owner, of, a, parcel, these, are, typically, used, to, transfer, development, rights, from, rural, areas, sending, sites, to, urban, areas, receiving, sites, with, more, demand, and, infrastructure, to, support, development, spot, zoning, is, a, controversial, practice, in, which, a, small, part, of, a, larger, zoning, district, is, rezoned, in, a, way, that, is, not, consistent, with, the, community, s, broader, planning, process, while, a, jurisdiction, can, rezone, even, a, single, parcel, of, land, in, some, cases, spot, zoning, is, often, disallowed, when, the, change, would, conflict, with, the, policies, and, objectives, of, existing, land, use, plans, other, factors, that, may, be, considered, in, these, cases, are, the, size, of, the, parcel, the, zoning, categories, involved, how, adjacent, properties, are, zoned, and, used, and, expected, benefits, and, harms, to, the, landowner, neighbors, and, community, conditional, zoning, is, a, legislative, process, in, which, site, specific, standards, and, conditions, become, part, of, the, zoning, ordinance, at, the, request, of, the, property, owner, the, conditions, may, be, more, or, less, restrictive, than, the, standard, zoning, conditional, zoning, can, be, considered, spot, zoning, and, can, be, challenged, on, those, grounds, conditional, zoning, should, not, be, confused, with, conditional, use, permits, also, called, special, use, permits, a, quasi, judicial, process, that, enables, land, uses, that, because, of, their, special, nature, may, be, suitable, only, in, certain, locations, or, when, arranged, or, operated, in, a, particular, manner, uses, which, might, be, disallowed, under, current, zoning, such, as, a, school, or, a, community, center, can, be, permitted, via, conditional, use, permits, contract, zoning, is, a, controversial, practice, in, which, there, is, a, bilateral, agreement, between, a, property, owner, and, a, local, government, to, rezone, a, property, in, exchange, for, a, commitment, from, the, developer, it, typically, involves, loosening, restrictions, on, how, the, property, can, be, used, contract, zoning, is, controversial, and, sometimes, prohibited, because, it, deviates, from, the, broader, planning, process, and, has, been, considered, an, illegal, bargaining, away, of, the, government, s, police, powers, to, enforce, zoning, fiscal, zoning, is, a, controversial, practice, in, which, local, governments, use, land, use, regulation, including, zoning, to, encourage, land, uses, that, generate, high, tax, revenue, and, exclude, uses, that, place, a, high, demand, on, public, services, environmental, activists, argue, that, putting, everyday, uses, out, of, walking, distance, of, each, other, leads, to, an, increase, in, traffic, since, people, have, to, own, cars, in, order, to, live, a, normal, life, where, their, basic, human, needs, are, met, and, get, in, their, cars, and, drive, to, meet, their, needs, throughout, the, day, single, use, zoning, and, urban, sprawl, have, also, been, criticized, as, making, work, family, balance, more, difficult, to, achieve, as, greater, distances, need, to, be, covered, in, order, to, integrate, the, different, life, domains, these, issues, are, especially, acute, in, the, united, states, with, its, high, level, of, car, usage, combined, with, insufficient, or, poorly, maintained, urban, rail, and, metro, systems, some, economists, claim, that, zoning, laws, work, against, economic, efficiency, reduce, responsiveness, to, consumer, demands, and, hinder, development, in, a, free, economy, as, poor, zoning, restrictions, hinder, the, more, efficient, usage, of, a, given, area, even, without, zoning, restrictions, a, landfill, for, example, would, likely, gravitate, to, cheaper, land, and, not, a, residential, area, single, use, zoning, laws, can, get, in, the, way, of, creative, developments, like, mixed, use, buildings, and, can, even, stop, harmless, activities, like, yard, sales, the, houston, example, of, non, zoning, or, private, zoning, with, no, restriction, on, particular, land, use, but, with, other, development, code, shows, a, combination, of, private, and, public, planning, other, critics, of, zoning, argue, that, zoning, laws, are, a, disincentive, to, provide, housing, which, results, in, an, increase, in, housing, costs, and, a, decrease, in, productive, economic, output, for, example, a, 2017, study, showed, that, if, all, states, deregulated, their, zoning, laws, only, halfway, to, the, level, of, texas, a, state, known, for, low, zoning, regulations, their, gdp, would, increase, by, 12, percent, due, to, more, productive, workers, and, opportunity, furthermore, critics, note, that, it, impedes, the, ability, of, those, that, wish, to, provide, charitable, housing, from, doing, so, for, example, in, 2022, gloversville, s, free, methodist, church, in, new, york, wished, to, provide, 40, beds, for, the, homeless, population, in, 4, degree, weather, and, were, inhibited, from, doing, so, corruption, is, a, challenge, for, zoning, some, have, argued, that, zoning, laws, increase, economic, inequality, empirical, effectiveness, estimates, show, some, zoning, approaches, can, contribute, to, housing, crisis, the, legal, framework, for, land, use, zoning, in, australia, is, established, by, states, and, territories, hence, each, state, or, territory, has, different, zoning, rules, land, use, zones, are, generally, defined, at, local, government, level, and, most, often, called, planning, schemes, in, reality, however, in, all, cases, the, state, governments, have, an, absolute, ability, to, overrule, the, local, decision, making, there, are, administrative, appeal, processes, such, as, vcat, to, challenge, decisions, statutory, planning, otherwise, known, as, town, planning, development, control, or, development, management, refers, to, the, part, of, the, planning, process, that, is, concerned, with, the, regulation, and, management, of, changes, to, land, use, and, development, planning, and, zoning, have, a, great, political, dimension, with, governments, often, criticized, for, favouring, developers, also, nimbyism, is, very, prevalent, in, canada, land, use, control, is, a, provincial, responsibility, deriving, from, the, constitutional, authority, over, property, and, civil, rights, this, authority, had, been, granted, to, the, provinces, under, the, british, north, america, acts, of, 1867, and, was, carried, forward, in, the, constitution, act, 1982, the, zoning, power, relates, to, real, property, or, land, and, the, improvements, constructed, thereon, that, become, part, of, the, land, itself, in, qu, bec, immeubles, the, provinces, empowered, the, municipalities, and, regions, to, control, the, use, of, land, within, their, boundaries, letting, the, municipalities, establish, their, own, zoning, by, laws, there, are, provisions, for, control, of, land, use, in, unorganized, areas, of, the, provinces, provincial, tribunals, are, the, ultimate, authority, for, appeals, and, reviews, in, france, the, code, of, urbanism, or, code, de, l, urbanisme, called, the, town, planning, code, a, national, law, guides, regional, and, local, planning, and, outlines, procedures, for, obtaining, building, permits, unlike, england, where, planners, must, use, their, discretion, to, allow, use, or, building, type, changes, private, development, in, france, is, permitted, as, long, as, the, developer, follows, the, legally, binding, regulations, zoning, districts, are, classified, into, twelve, use, zones, each, zone, determines, a, building, s, shape, and, permitted, uses, a, building, s, shape, is, controlled, by, zonal, restrictions, on, allowable, floor, area, ratio, and, height, in, absolute, terms, and, in, relation, with, adjacent, buildings, and, roads, these, controls, are, intended, to, allow, adequate, light, and, ventilation, between, buildings, and, on, roads, instead, of, single, use, zoning, zones, are, defined, by, the,

develop, land, by, right, however, existing, development, allows, land, use, by, right, as, long, as, the, use, does, not, constitute, a, change, in, the, type, of, land, use, a, property, owner,

planning, authorities, lpas, in, the, united, kingdom, generally, they, are, the, local, borough, or, district, council, or, a, unitary, authority, they, each, use, a, discretionary, plan, led, system, whereby, development, plans, are, formed, and, the, public, consulted, subsequent, development, requires, planning, permission, which, will, be, granted, or, refused, with, reference, to, the, development, plan, as, a, material, consideration, the, plan, does, not, provide, specific, guidance, on, what, type, of, buildings, will, be, allowed, in, a, given, location, rather, it, provides, general, principles, for, development, and, goals, for, the, management, of, urban, change, because, planning, committees, made, up, of, directly, elected, local, councillors, or, in, some, cases, planning, officers, themselves, via, delegated, decisions, have, discretion, on, each, application, for, development, or, change, of, use, made, the, system, is, considered, a, discretionary, one, planning, applications, can, differ, greatly, in, scale, from, airports, and, new, towns, to, minor, modifications, to, individual, houses, in, order, to, prevent, local, authorities, from, being, overwhelmed, by, high, volumes, of, small, scale, applications, from, individual, householders, a, separate, system, of, permitted, development, has, been, introduced, permitted, development, rules, are, largely, form, based, but, in, the, absence, of, zoning, are, applied, at, the, national, level, examples, include, allowing, a, two, storey, extension, up, to, three, metres, at, the, rear, of, a, property, extensions, up, to, 50, of, the, original, width, at, each, side, and, certain, types, of, outbuildings, in, the, garden, provided, that, no, more, than, 50, of, the, land, area, is, built, over, these, are, appropriately, sized, for, a, typical, three, bedroom, semi, detached, property, but, must, be, applied, across, a, wide, variety, of, housing, types, from, small, terraces, to, larger, detached, properties, and, manor, houses, in, august, 2020, the, uk, government, published, a, consultation, document, called, planning, for, the, future, the, proposals, hint, at, a, move, toward, zoning, with, areas, given, a, growth, renewal, or, protected, designation, with, the, possibility, of, sub, areas, within, each, category, although, the, document, does, not, elaborate, on, what, the, details, of, these, might, be, from, february, to, april, 2024, they, have, been, running, a, permitted, development, consultation, with, the, aim, of, allowing, increased, densities, gentle, densification, through, the, permitted, development, system, on, a, national, rather, than, zoned, scale, under, the, police, power, rights, state, governments, may, exercise, over, private, real, property, with, this, power, special, laws, and, regulations, have, long, been, made, restricting, the, places, where, particular, types, of, business, can, be, carried, on, in, 1904, los, angeles, established, the, nation, s, first, land, use, restrictions, for, a, portion, of, the, city, new, york, city, adopted, the, first, zoning, regulations, to, apply, city, wide, in, 1916, the, constitutionality, of, zoning, ordinances, was, upheld, by, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, the, 1926, case, village, of, euclid, ohio, v, ambler, realty, co, among, large, populated, cities, in, the, united, states, houston, is, unique, in, having, no, zoning, ordinances, rather, land, use, is, regulated, by, other, means, early, zoning, practices, were, subtle, and, often, debated, some, claim, the, practices, started, in, the, 1920s, while, others, suggest, the, birth, of, zoning, occurred, in, new, york, in, 1916, both, of, these, examples, for, the, start, of, zoning, however, were, urban, cases, zoning, becomes, an, increasing, legal, force, as, it, continues, to, expand, in, its, geographical, range, through, its, introduction, in, other, urban, centres, and, use, in, larger, political, and, geographical, boundaries, regional, zoning, was, the, next, step, in, increased, geographical, size, of, areas, under, zoning, laws, a, major, difference, between, urban, zoning, and, regional, zoning, was, that, regional, areas, consequently, seldom, bear, direct, relationship, to, arbitrary, political, boundaries, this, form, of, zoning, also, included, rural, areas, which, was, counter, intuitive, to, the, theory, that, zoning, was, a, result, of, population, density, finally, zoning, also, expanded, again, but, back, to, a, political, boundary, again, with, state, zoning, use, based, zoning, especially, single, use, zoning, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, zoning, in, the, us, where, it, is, known, as, euclidean, zoning, after, euclid, ohio, s, role, in, a, landmark, u, s, supreme, court, case, village, of, euclid, v, ambler, realty, co, single, use, zoning, takes, two, forms, flat, and, hierarchical, also, known, as, cumulative, or, pyramidal, 61, 63, under, flat, zoning, each, district, is, strictly, designated, for, one, use, in, a, simple, hierarchical, zoning, system, districts, are, organized, with, residential, the, most, sensitive, and, least, disruptive, category, at, the, top, followed, by, commercial, and, industrial, residential, and, commercial, buildings, are, allowed, in, industrial, zones, and, residential, buildings, are, allowed, in, commercial, zones, 61, 63, more, complex, hierarchical, systems, account, for, multiple, levels, within, categories, such, as, multiple, types, of, residential, buildings, in, multifamily, residential, districts, 130, hierarchical, zoning, generally, fell, out, of, favor, in, the, united, states, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, with, flat, zoning, becoming, more, popular, although, many, municipalities, still, incorporate, some, degree, of, hierarchy, in, their, zoning, ordinances, 65, single, use, zoning, is, used, by, many, municipalities, due, to, its, ease, of, implementation, one, set, of, explicit, prescriptive, rules, long, established, legal, precedent, and, familiarity, to, planners, and, design, professionals, single, use, zoning, has, been, criticized, however, for, its, lack, of, flexibility, separation, of, uses, can, contribute, to, urban, sprawl, loss, of, open, space, heavy, infrastructure, costs, and, automobile, dependency, 266, 275, in, particular, single, family, zoning, residential, districts, where, only, single, family, homes, can, be, built, has, been, widely, criticized, as, a, cause, of, sprawl, and, racial, segregation, the, united, states, suffers, from, greater, levels, of, deurbanization, and, urban, decay, than, other, developed, countries, and, additional, problems, such, as, urban, prairies, that, do, not, occur, elsewhere, jonathan, rothwell, has, argued, that, zoning, encourages, racial, segregation, he, claims, a, strong, relationship, exists, between, an, area, s, allowance, of, building, housing, at, higher, density, and, racial, integration, between, blacks, and, whites, in, the, united, states, the, relationship, between, segregation, and, density, is, explained, by, rothwell, and, massey, as, the, restrictive, density, zoning, producing, higher, housing, prices, in, white, areas, and, limiting, opportunities, for, people, with, modest, incomes, to, leave, segregated, areas, between, 1980, and, 2000, racial, integration, occurred, faster, in, areas, that, did, not, have, strict, density, regulations, than, those, that, did, rothwell, and, massey, suggest, homeowners, and, business, interests, are, the, two, key, players, in, density, regulations, that, emerge, from, a, political, economy, they, propose, that, in, older, states, where, rural, jurisdictions, are, primarily, composed, of, homeowners, it, is, the, narrow, interests, of, homeowners, to, block, development, because, tax, rates, are, lower, in, rural, areas, and, taxation, is, more, likely, to, fall, on, the, median, homeowner, business, interests, are, unable, to, counteract, the, homeowners, interests, in, rural, areas, because, business, interests, are, weaker, and, business, ownership, is, rarely, controlled, by, people, living, outside, the, community, this, translates, into, rural, communities, that, have, a, tendency, to, resist, development, by, using, density, regulations, to, make, business, opportunities, less, attractive, density, zoning, regulations, in, the, u, s, increase, residential, segregation, in, metropolitan, areas, by, reducing, the, availability, of, affordable, housing, in, some, jurisdictions, other, zoning, regulations, like, school, infrastructure, regulations, and, growth, controls, are, also, variables, associated, with, higher, segregation, with, more, permissive, zoning, regulations, there, are, lower, levels, of, segregation, desegregation, is, higher, in, places, with, more, liberal, regulations, on, zoning, allowing, the, residents, to, integrate, racially, metropolitan, areas, that, allowed, higher, density, development, moved, rapidly, toward, racial, integration, than, their, counterparts, with, strict, density, limitations, the, greater, the, allowable, density, the, lower, the, level, of, racial, segregation, zoning, laws, that, limit, the, construction, of, new, housing, like, single, family, zoning, are, associated, with, reduced, affordability, and, are, a, major, factor, in, residential, segregation, in, the, united, states, by, income, and, race
