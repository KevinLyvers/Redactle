extend, its, authority, over, the, coastal, territory, of, alta, california, the, fort, on, presidio, hill, was, gradually, abandoned, while, the, town, of, san, diego, grew, up, on, the, level, land, below, presidio, hill, the, mission, was, secularized, by, the, mexican, government, in, 1834, and, most, of, the, mission, lands, were, granted, to, former, soldiers, the, 432, residents, of, the,

been, losing, population, throughout, the, 1830s, due, to, increasing, tension, between, the, settlers, and, the, indigenous, kumeyaay, and, in, 1838, the, town, lost, its, pueblo, status, because, its, size, dropped, to, an, estimated, 100, to, 150, residents, the, ranchos, in, the, san, diego, region, would, face, kumeyaay, raids, in, the, late, 1830s, and, the, town, itself, would, face, raids, in, the, 1840s, americans, gained, an, increased, awareness, of, california, and, its, commercial, possibilities, from, the, writings, of, two, countrymen, involved, in, the, often, officially, forbidden, to, foreigners, but, economically, significant, hide, and, tallow, trade, where, san, diego, was, a, major, port, and, the, only, one, with, an, adequate, harbor, william, shaler, s, journal, of, a, voyage, between, china, and, the, north, western, coast, of, america, made, in, 1804, and, richard, henry, dana, s, more, substantial, and, convincing, account, of, his, 1834, 36,

first, they, had, an, easy, time, of, it, capturing, the, major, ports, including, san, diego, but, the, californios, in, southern, alta, california, struck, back, following, the, successful, revolt, in, los, angeles, the, american, garrison, at, san, diego, was, driven, out, without, firing, a, shot, in, early, october, 1846, mexican, partisans, held, san, diego, for, three, weeks, until, october, 24, 1846, when, the, americans, recaptured, it, for, the, next, several, months, the, americans, were, blockaded, inside, the, pueblo, skirmishes, occurred, daily, and, snipers, shot, into, the, town, every, night, the, californios, drove, cattle, away, from, the, pueblo, hoping, to, starve, the, americans, and, their, californio, supporters, out, on, december, 1, the, american,

san, pasqual, fought, in, the, san, pasqual, valley, which, is, now, part, of, the, city, of, san, diego, the, americans, suffered, their, worst, losses, in, the, campaign, subsequently, a, column, led, by, lieutenant, gray, arrived, from, san, diego, rescuing, kearny, s, battered, and, blockaded, command, stockton, and, kearny, went, on, to, recover, los, angeles, and, force, the, capitulation, of, alta, california, with, the, treaty, of, cahuenga, on, january, 13, 1847, as, a, result, of, the, mexican, american, war, of, 1846, 48, the, territory, of, alta, california, including, san, diego, was, ceded, to, the, united, states, by, mexico, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, in, 1848, the, mexican, negotiators, of, that, treaty, tried, to, retain, san, diego, as, part, of, mexico, but, the, americans, insisted, that, san, diego, was, for, every, commercial, purpose, of, nearly, equal, importance, to, us, with, that, of, san, francisco, and, the, mexican, american, border, was, eventually, established, to, be, one, league, south, of, the, southernmost, point, of, san, diego, bay, so, as, to, include, the, entire, bay, within, the, united, states, the, state, of, california, was, admitted, to, the, united, states, in, 1850, that, same, year, san, diego, was, designated, the, seat, of, the, newly, established, county, of, san, diego, and, was, incorporated, as, a, city, joshua, h, bean, the, last, alcalde, of, san, diego, was, elected, the, first, mayor, two, years, later, the, city, was, bankrupt, the, california, legislature, revoked, the, city, s, charter, and, placed, it, under, control, of, a, board, of, trustees, where, it, remained, until, 1889, a, city, charter, was, reestablished, in, 1889, and, today, s, city, charter, was, adopted, in, 1931, the, original, town, of, san, diego, was, located, at, the, foot, of, presidio, hill, in, the, area, which, is, now, old, town, san, diego, state, historic, park, the, location, was, not, ideal, being, several, miles, away, from, navigable, water, at, its, port, at, la, playa, in, 1850, william, heath, davis, promoted, a, new, development, by, the, bay, shore, called, new, san, diego, several, miles, south, of, the, original, settlement, however, for, several, decades, the, new, development, consisted, only, of, a, pier, a, few, houses, and, an, army, depot, for, the, support, of, fort, yuma, after, 1854, the, fort, became, supplied, by, sea, and, by, steamboats, on, the, colorado, river, and, the, depot, fell, into, disuse, from, 1857, to, 1860, san, diego, became, the, western, terminus, of, the, san, antonio, san, diego, mail, line, the, earliest, overland, stagecoach, and, mail, operation, from, the, eastern, united, states, to, california, coming, from, texas, through, new, mexico, territory, in, less, than, 30, days, in, the, late, 1860s, alonzo, horton, promoted, a, move, to, the, bayside, area, which, he, called, new, town, and, which, became, downtown, san, diego, horton, promoted, the, area, heavily, and, people, and, businesses, began, to, relocate, to, new, town, because, its, location, on, san, diego, bay, was, convenient, to, shipping, new, town, soon, eclipsed, the, original, settlement, known, to, this, day, as, old, town, and, became, the, economic, and, governmental, heart, of, the, city, still, san, diego, remained, a, relative, backwater, town, until, the, arrival, of, a, railroad, connection, in, 1878, in, 1884, 1886, john, j, montgomery, made, the, first, controlled, flights, by, an, american, in, a, heavier, than, air, unpowered, glider, just, south, of, san, diego, at, otay, mesa, helping, to, pioneer, a, new, science, of, aerodynamics, in, 1912, san, diego, was, the, site, of, a, free, speech, fight, between, the, industrial, workers, of, the, world, and, the, city, government, who, passed, an, ordinance, forbidding, the, freedom, of, speech, along, an, area, of, soapbox, row, that, led, to, civil, disobedience, vigilantism, police, violence, the, abduction, of, emma, goldman, s, husband, ben, reitman, and, multiple, riots, san, diego, s, proximity, to, tijuana, during, the, mexican, revolution, made, this, one, of, the, most, significant, free, speech, fights, during, the, wobbly, era, in, 1916, the, neighborhood, of, stingaree, the, original, home, of, san, diego, s, first, chinatown, and, soapbox, row, was, demolished, by, anti, vice, campaigners, to, make, way, for, the, gaslamp, quarter, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, san, diego, hosted, the, world, s, fair, twice, the, panama, california, exposition, 1915, and, the, california, pacific, international, exposition, in, 1935, both, expositions, were, held, in, balboa, park, and, many, of, the, spanish, baroque, style, buildings, that, were, built, for, those, expositions, remain, to, this, day, as, central, features, of, the, park, the, buildings, were, intended, to, be, temporary, structures, but, most, remained, in, continuous, use, until, they, progressively, fell, into, disrepair, most, were, eventually, rebuilt, using, castings, of, the, original, fa, ades, to, retain, the, architectural, style, the, menagerie, of, exotic, animals, featured, at, the, 1915, exposition, provided, the, basis, for, the, san, diego, zoo, during, the, 1950s, there, was, a, citywide, festival, called, fiesta, del, pacifico, highlighting, the, area, s, spanish, and, mexican, past, in, the, 2010s, there, was, a, proposal, for, a, large, scale, celebration, of, the, 100th, anniversary, of, balboa, park, but, the, plans, were, abandoned, when, the, organization, tasked, with, putting, on, the, celebration, went, out, of, business, the, southern, portion, of, the, point, loma, peninsula, was, set, aside, for, military, purposes, as, early, as, 1852, over, the, next, several, decades, the, army, set, up, a, series, of, coastal, artillery, batteries, and, named, the, area, fort, rosecrans, significant, u, s, navy, presence, began, in, 1901, with, the, establishment, of, the, navy, coaling, station, in, point, loma, and, expanded, greatly, during, the, 1920s, by, 1930, the, city, was, host, to, naval, base, san, diego, naval, training, center, san, diego, san, diego, naval, hospital, camp, matthews, and, camp, kearny, now, marine, corps, air, station, miramar, the, city, was, also, an, early, center, for, aviation, as, early, as, world, war, i, san, diego, was, proclaiming, itself, the, air, capital, of, the, west, the, city, was, home, to, important, airplane, developers, and, manufacturers, like, ryan, airlines, later, ryan, aeronautical, founded, in, 1925, and, consolidated, aircraft, later, convair, founded, in, 1923, charles, a, lindbergh, s, plane, the, spirit, of, st, louis, was, built, in, san, diego, in, 1927, by, ryan, airlines, during, world, war, ii, san, diego, became, a, major, hub, of, military, and, defense, activity, due, to, the, presence, of, so, many, military, installations, and, defense, manufacturers, the, city, s, population, grew, rapidly, during, and, after, world, war, ii, more, than, doubling, between, 1930, 147, 995, and, 1950, 333, 865, during, the, final, months, of, the, war, the, japanese, had, a, plan, to, target, multiple, u, s, cities, for, biological, attack, starting, with, san, diego, the, plan, was, called, operation, cherry, blossoms, at, night, and, called, for, kamikaze, planes, filled, with, fleas, infected, with, plague, yersinia, pestis, to, crash, into, civilian, population, centers, in, the, city, hoping, to, spread, plague, in, the, city, and, effectively, kill, tens, of, thousands, of, civilians, the, plan, was, scheduled, to, launch, on, september, 22, 1945, but, was, not, carried, out, because, japan, surrendered, five, weeks, earlier, after, world, war, ii, the, military, continued, to, play, a, major, role, in, the, local, economy, but, post, cold, war, cutbacks, took, a, heavy, toll, on, the, local, defense, and, aerospace, industries, the, resulting, downturn, led, san, diego, leaders, to, seek, to, diversify, the, city, s, economy, by, focusing, on, research, and, science, as, well, as, tourism, from, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, through, the, 1970s, the, american, tuna, fishing, fleet, and, tuna, canning, industry, were, based, in, san, diego, the, tuna, capital, of, the, world, san, diego, s, first, tuna, cannery, was, founded, in, 1911, and, by, the, mid, 1930s, the, canneries, employed, more, than, 1, 000, people, a, large, fishing, fleet, supported, the, canneries, mostly, staffed, by, immigrant, fishermen, from, japan, and, later, from, the, portuguese, azores, and, italy, whose, influence, is, still, felt, in, neighborhoods, like, little, italy, and, point, loma, due, to, rising, costs, and, foreign, competition, the, last, of, the, canneries, closed, in, the, early, 1980s, downtown, san, diego, was, in, decline, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, but, experienced, some, urban, renewal, since, the, early, 1980s, including, the, opening, of, horton, plaza, the, revival, of, the, gaslamp, quarter, and, the, construction, of, the, san, diego, convention, center, petco, park, opened, in, 2004, outside, of, downtown, san, diego, annexed, large, swaths, of, land, and, for, suburban, expansion, to, the, north, and, control, of, the, san, ysidro, port, of, entry, as, the, cold, war, ended, the, military, shrank, and, so, did, defense, spending, san, diego, has, since, become, a, center, of, the, emerging, biotech, industry, and, is, home, to, telecommunications, giant, qualcomm, san, diego, had, also, grown, in, the, tourism, industry, with, the, popularity, of, attractions, such, as, the, san, diego, zoo, seaworld, san, diego, and, legoland, california, in, carlsbad, according, to, sdsu, professor, emeritus, monte, marshall, san, diego, bay, is, the, surface, expression, of, a, north, south, trending, nested, graben, the, rose, canyon, and, point, loma, fault, zones, are, part, of, the, san, andreas, fault, system, about, 40, miles, 64, km, east, of, the, bay, are, the, laguna, mountains, in, the, peninsular, ranges, which, are, part, of, the, backbone, of, the, american, continents, the, city, lies, on, approximately, 200, deep, canyons, and, hills, separating, its, mesas, creating, small, pockets, of, natural, open, space, scattered, throughout, the, city, and, giving, it, a, hilly, geography, traditionally, san, diegans, have, built, their, homes, and, businesses, on, the, mesas, while, leaving, the, urban, canyons, relatively, wild, thus, the, canyons, give, parts, of, the, city, a, segmented, feel, creating, gaps, between, otherwise, proximate, neighborhoods, and, contributing, to, a, low, density, car, centered, environment, the, san, diego, river, runs, through, the, middle, of, san, diego, from, east, to, west, creating, a, river, valley, that, serves, to, divide, the, city, into, northern, and, southern, segments, during, the, historic, period, and, presumably, earlier, as, well, the, river, has, shifted, its, flow, back, and, forth, between, san, diego, bay, and, mission, bay, and, its, fresh, water, was, the, focus, of, the, earliest, spanish, explorers, miguel, costans, a, cartographer, wrote, in, 1769, when, asked, by, signs, where, the, watering, place, was, the, indians, pointed, to, a, grove, which, could, be, seen, at, a, considerable, distance, to, the, northeast, giving, to, understand, that, a, river, or, creek, flowed, through, it, and, that, they, would, lead, our, men, to, it, if, they, would, follow, that, river, was, the, san, diego, river, several, reservoirs, and, mission, trails, regional, park, also, lie, between, and, separate, developed, areas, of, the, city, notable, peaks, within, the, city, limits, include, cowles, mountain, the, highest, point, in, the, city, at, 1, 591, feet, 485, m, black, mountain, at, 1, 558, feet, 475, m, and, mount, soledad, at, 824, feet, 251, m, the, cuyamaca, mountains, and, laguna, mountains, rise, to, the, east, of, the, city, and, beyond, the, mountains, are, desert, areas, the, cleveland, national, forest, is, a, half, hour, drive, from, downtown, san, diego, numerous, farms, are, found, in, the, valleys, northeast, and, southeast, of, the, city, under, the, k, ppen, geiger, climate, classification, system, the, san, diego, area, has, been, variously, categorized, as, having, either, a, hot, semi, arid, climate, bsh, in, the, original, classification, and, bskn, in, modified, k, ppen, classification, with, the, n, denoting, summer, fog, or, a, hot, summer, mediterranean, climate, csa, san, diego, s, climate, is, characterized, by, warm, dry, summers, and, mild, winters, with, most, of, the, annual, precipitation, falling, between, december, and, march, the, city, has, a, mild, climate, year, round, with, an, average, of, 201, days, above, 70, f, 21, c, and, low, rainfall, 9, 13, inches, annually, the, climate, in, san, diego, like, most, of, southern, california, often, varies, significantly, over, short, geographical, distances, resulting, in, microclimates, in, san, diego, this, is, mostly, because, of, the, city, s, topography, the, bay, and, the, numerous, hills, mountains, and, canyons, frequently, particularly, during, the, may, gray, june, gloom, period, a, thick, marine, layer, cloud, cover, keeps, the, air, cool, and, damp, within, a, few, miles, of, the, coast, but, yields, to, bright, cloudless, sunshine, approximately, 5, 10, miles, 8, 16, km, inland, sometimes, the, june, gloom, lasts, into, july, causing, cloudy, skies, over, most, of, san, diego, for, the, entire, day, even, in, the, absence, of, june, gloom, inland, areas, experience, much, more, significant, temperature, variations, than, coastal, areas, where, the, ocean, serves, as, a, moderating, influence, thus,
