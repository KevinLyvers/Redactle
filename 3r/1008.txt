the, various, yemeni, tribal, states, except, for, the, northern, mountains, controlled, by, the, zaydi, imams, into, one, entity, the, ayyubids, switched, the, country, s, official, religious, allegiance, to, the, sunni, muslim, abbasids, during, the, reign, of, the, ayyubid, emir, tughtekin, ibn, ayyub, the, city, underwent, significant, improvements, these, included, the, incorporation, of, the, garden, lands, on, the, western, bank, of, the, sa, ilah, known, as, bustan, al, sultan, where, the, ayyubids, built, one, of, their, palaces, however, ayyubid, control, of, sanaa, was, never, very, consistent, and, they, only, occasionally, exercised, direct, authority, over, the, city, instead, they, chose, ta, izz, as, their, capital, while, aden, was, their, principal, income, producing, city, while, the, rasulids, controlled, most, of, yemen, followed, by, their, successors, the, tahirids, sanaa, largely, remained, in, the, political, orbit, of, the, zaydi, imams, from, 1323, to, 1454, and, outside, the, former, two, dynasties, rule, the, mamelukes, arrived, in, yemen, in, 1517, the, ottoman, empire, entered, yemen, in, 1538, when, suleiman, the, magnificent, was,

mocha, frequented, sanaa, to, maintain, special, privileges, and, capitulations, for, their, trade, in, 1602, the, local, zaydi, imams, led, by, imam, al, mu, ayyad, reasserted, their, control, over, the, area, and, forced, out, ottoman, troops, in, 1629, although, the, ottomans, fled, during, al, mu, ayyad, s, reign, his, predecessor, al, mansur, al, qasim, had, already, vastly, weakened, the, ottoman, army, in, sana, a, and, yemen, consequently, european, traders, were, stripped, of, their, previous, privileges, the, zaydi, imams, maintained, their, rule, over, sanaa, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, the, ottomans, relaunched, their, campaign, to, control, the, region, in, 1835, ottoman, troops, arrived, on, the, yemeni, coast, under, the, guise, of, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, s, troops, they, did, not, capture, sanaa, until, 1872, when, their, troops, led, by, ahmed, muhtar, pasha, entered, the, city, the, ottoman, empire, instituted, the, tanzimat, reforms, throughout, the, lands, they, governed, in, sanaa, city, planning, was, initiated, for, the, first, time, new, roads, were, built, and, schools, and, hospitals, were, established, the, reforms, were, rushed, by, the, ottomans, to, solidify, their, control, of, sana, a, to, compete, with, an, expanding, egypt, british, influence, in, aden, and, imperial, italian, and, french, influence, along, the, coast, of, somalia, particularly, in, the, towns, of, djibouti, and, berbera, the, modernization, reforms, in, sanaa, were, still, very, limited, however, in, 1904, as, ottoman, influence, was, waning, in, yemen, imam, yahya, of, the, zaydi, imams, took, power, in, sanaa, in, a, bid, to, secure, north, yemen, s, independence, yahya, embarked, on, a, policy, of, isolationism, avoiding, international, and, arab, world, politics, cracking, down, on, embryonic, liberal, movements, not, contributing, to, the, development, of, infrastructure, in, sanaa, and, elsewhere, and, closing, down, the, ottoman, girls, school, as, a, consequence, of, yahya, s, measures, sanaa, increasingly, became, a, hub, of, anti, government, organization, and, intellectual, revolt, in, the, 1930s, several, organizations, opposing, or, demanding, reform, of, the, zaydi, imamate, sprung, up, in, the, city, particularly, fatat, al, fulayhi, a, group, of, various, yemeni, muslim, scholars, based, in, sana, a, s, fulayhi, madrasa, and, hait, al, nidal, committee, of, the, struggle, by, 1936, most, of, the, leaders, of, these, movements, were, imprisoned, in, 1941, another, group, based, in, the, city, the, shabab, al, amr, bil, maruf, wal, nahian, al, munkar, called, for, a, nahda, renaissance, in, the, country, as, well, as, the, establishment, of, a, parliament, with, islam, as, the, instrument, of, yemeni, revival, yahya, largely, repressed, the, shabab, and, most, of, its, leaders, were, executed, following, his, son, imam, ahmad, s, inheritance, of, power, in, 1948, that, year, sanaa, was, replaced, with, ta, izz, as, capital, following, ahmad, s, new, residence, there, most, government, offices, followed, suit, a, few, years, later, most, of, the, city, s, jewish, population, emigrated, to, israel, ahmad, began, a, process, of, gradual, economic, and, political, liberalization, but, by, 1961, sanaa, was, witnessing, major, demonstrations, and, riots, demanding, quicker, reform, and, change, pro, republican, officers, in, the, north, yemeni, military, sympathetic, of, gamal, abdel, nasser, of, egypt, s, government, and, pan, arabist, policies, staged, a, coup, overthrowing, the,

actively, supported, north, yemen, s, rural, tribes, pitting, large, parts, of, the, country, against, the, urban, and, largely, pro, republican, inhabitants, of, sanaa, the, north, yemen, civil, war, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, some, parts, of, the, city, s, ancient, heritage, and, continued, until, 1968, when, a, deal, between, the, republicans, and, the, royalists, was, reached, establishing, a, presidential, system, instability, in, sanaa, continued, due, to, continuing, coups, and, political, assassinations, until, the, situation, in, the, country, stabilized, in, the, late, 1970s, the, new, government, s, modernization, projects, changed, the, face, of, sanaa, the, new, tahrir, square, was, built, on, what, had, formerly, been, the, former, imam, s, palace, grounds, and, new, buildings, were, constructed, on, the, north, and, northwest, of, the, city, this, was, accompanied, by, the, destruction, of, several, of, the, old, city, s, gates, as, well, as, sections, of, the, wall, around, it, after, the, end, of, the, civil, war, in, 1970, sanaa, began, to, expand, outward, this, was, a, period, of, prosperity, in, yemen, partly, due, to, the, massive, migration, of, yemeni, workers, to, the, gulf, states, and, their, subsequent, sending, of, money, back, home, at, first, most, of, the, new, development, was, concentrated, around, central, areas, like, al, tahrir, the, modern, centre, bi, r, al, azab, the, ottoman, quarter, and, bab, al, yaman, the, old, southern, gate, however, this, soon, shifted, to, the, city, s, outskirts, where, an, influx, of, immigrants, from, the, countryside, established, new, neighborhoods, two, areas, in, particular, experienced, major, growth, during, this, period, first, the, area, along, taizz, road, in, the, south, and, second, a, broader, area, on, the, west, side, of, the, city, between, bi, r, al, azab, and, the, new, avenue, called, sittin, a, new, ring, road, built, in, the, 1970s, on, the,

sections, skilled, performers, often, embellish, a, song, s, melody, to, highlight, its, emotional, tone, in, the, earliest, days, of, the, recording, industry, in, yemen, from, 1938, into, the, 1940s, sanaani, music, was, the, dominant, genre, among, yemenis, who, could, afford, to, buy, records, and, phonographs, primarily, in, aden, as, prices, fell, sanaani, style, records, became, increasingly, popular, among, the, middle, class, but, at, the, same, time, it, began, to, encounter, competition, from, other, genres, including, western, and, indian, music, as, well, as, music, from, other, arab, countries, the, earliest, sanaani, recording, stars, generally, came, from, wealthy, religious, families, the, most, popular, was, ali, abu, bakr, ba, sharahil, who, recorded, for,

theatre, going, back, at, least, a, century, in, sanaa, most, performances, take, place, at, the, cultural, center, markaz, al, thaqafi, which, was, originally, designed, as, an, auditorium, instead, of, a, theatre, it, possesses, only, the, most, basic, of, lighting, and, sound, equipment, and, the, smallest, of, wings, and, lacks, space, to, store, props, or, backdrops, yet, despite, the,

march, 27, in, the, 21st, century, the, actors, and, directors, have, increasingly, come, from, sanaa, in, 2012, in, addition, to, the, festival, there, was, a, national, theatre, competition, sponsored, by, equal, access, yemen, and, future, partners, for, development, featuring, theatre, troupes, from, around, the, country, it, had, two, rounds, the, first, was, held, in, six, different, governorates, and, the, second, was, held, in, sanaa, sanaa, s, theatre, scene, was, disrupted, by, war, and, famine, in, the, 2010s, additionally, since, the, houthis, gained, control, of, the, city, in, 2014, they, have, imposed, strict, rules, on, dress, gender, segregation, and, entertainment, in, the, capital, in, december, 2020, however, a, performance, was, held, in, sanaa, by, one, troupe, to, offer, respite, and, entertainment, to, people, in, a, city, suffering, from, the, civil, war, and, the, ongoing, coronavirus, pandemic, directed, by, mohammad, khaled, the, performance, drew, a, crowd, of, dozens, of, men, women, and, children, football, is, the, most, popular, sport, in, sana, a, the, city, is, home, to, the, ali, muhesen, stadium, home, of, the, yemen, national, football,

captive, ethiopian, lions, kept, at, addis, ababa, zoo, and, more, similar, to, lions, from, eastern, and, southern, africa, there, is, a, daily, practice, of, qat, chewing, which, exists, within, the, city, of, sana, a, qat, is, a, type, of, plant, with, stimulant, like, qualities, this, daily, practice, occurs, in, a, mafraj, which, is, a, room, designated, for, qat, chewing, qat, comes, in, three, different, varieties, ahmar, abiad, and, azraq, translated, to, red, white, and, blue, with, ahmar, being, considered, of, the, highest, quality, and, abiad, being, considered, the, weakest, according, to, a, foreign, resident, the, qat, from, the, north, of, sana, a, is, the, most, prized, of, the, qat, grown, locally, this, daily, chewing, tradition, starts, in, the, qat, market, with, the, leaves, used, for, a, particular, day, being, bought, day, of, use, the, city, s, population, growth, soared, from, the, 1960s, onward, as, a, result, of, mass, rural, migration, to, the, city, in, search, of, employment, and, improved, standard, of, living, sana, a, is, the, fastest, growing, capital, city, in, the, world, with, a, growth, rate, of, 7, while, the, growth, rate, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, is, 3, 2, about, 10, of, the, population, resides, in, the, old, city, while, the, remainder, lives, in, the, outside, districts, the, three, large, administrative, districts, in, increasing, population, size, are, shu, ub, ma, in, and, as, sab, in, with, populations, of, about, 500, 000, 630, 000, and, 730, 000, respectively, the, population, in, sanaa, is, very, young, with, almost, 60, of, people, in, the, amanat, al, asimah, governorate, being, under, 18, years, old, the, population, also, skews, slightly, male, with, a, male, to, female, ratio, of, 1, 10, a, majority, of, sanaa, s, inhabitants, practice, zaydi, islam, while, sunnis, and, isma, ilis, are, minority, groups, sunnis, tend, to, be, most, concentrated, in, the, newer, parts, of, the, city, reflecting, an, influx, of, new, residents, from, the, countryside, since, the, late, 20th, century, before, the, revolution, of, 1962, sanaani, society, was, divided, into, a, fairly, well, defined, hierarchy, of, social, classes, there, were, five, major, groups, ranked, from, highest, to, lowest, they, were, the, sayyids, the, qadis, the, mansib, s, plural, manasib, the, bani, khumis, also, called, the, muzayyin, and, the, akhdam, since, then, the, system, of, social, class, has, changed, significantly, in, the, context, of, market, capitalism, at, the, top, of, the, traditional, social, order, were, the, sayyids, who, claimed, descent, from, muhammad, and, were, therefore, seen, as, the, legitimate, ruling, class, right, below, them, were, the, qadis, who, similarly, claimed, descent, from, an, original, class, of, judges, because, of, their, elite, status, the, sayyids, were, the, main, targets, of, the, 1962, revolution, but, they, and, the, qadis, continue, to, wield, a, strong, cultural, influence, today, below, these, elite, groups, were, the, manasib, whose, name, literally, means, dignity, rank, or, position, these, included, artisans, employed, in, honourable, trades, such, as, metalsmiths, for, gold, silver, copper, and, iron, carpenters, dyers, builders, and, masons, plumbers, turners, i, e, lathe, operators, porters, painters, of, inscriptions, and, makers, of, weapons, hookahs, or, mattresses, although, these, trades, were, seen, as, somewhat, demeaning, for, members, of, the, upper, classes, to, take, part, in, they, were, still, fairly, respectable, and, in, some, cases, sayyids, or, qadis, would, engage, in, them, as, a, main, source, of, income, the, manasib, were, generally, considered, to, have, tribal, ancestry, and, martial, connotations, and, they, were, the, ones, who, were, mustered, to, defend, the, city, when, it, was, attacked, the, bani, khumis, literally, the, sons, of, the, fifth, were, the, ones, who, took, part, in, trades, that, the, three, higher, ranked, classes, refused, to, work, in, these, included, cobblers, tanners, makers, of, leather, sheaths, saddlers, brickmakers, butchers, barbers, bath, attendants, coffee, house, proprietors, brass, founders, and, vegetable, gardeners, below, the, bani, khumis, were, the, akhdam, the, lowest, social, class, who, were, mostly, street, sweepers, this, traditional, class, hierarchy, began, to, change, rapidly, in, the, decades, after, the, 1962, revolution, particularly, during, the, 1970s, there, was, a, shift, towards, a, new, social, hierarchy, that, was, based, not, on, birthright, but, on, wealth, for, example, working, in, commerce, such, as, qat, merchants, or, caf, proprietors, was, traditionally, looked, down, upon, by, upper, classes, like, sayyids, and, qabili, s, i, e, tribesmen, but, as, it, became, increasingly, lucrative, during, the, 1970s, it, was, increasingly, seen, as, respectable, and, now, some, members, of, the, traditional, upper, classes, are, willing, to, engage, in, these, trades, this, does, not, extend, to, all, profitable, trades, though, butchering, for, example, still, has, a, stigma, despite, bringing, in, a, fair, amount, of, money, this, shift, has, been, far, more, pronounced, in, sanaa, a, big, city, where, resources, are, most, concentrated, than, in, rural, areas, where, old, social, divisions, are, much, more, strongly, maintained, today, some, of, the, contributing, factors, to, the, shift, included, the, new, education, system, modeled, on, egypt, s, widespread, migration, of, yemeni, men, to, other, oil, rich, arab, states, and, greater, integration, of, yemen, into, the, global, economy, jews, have, been, present, in, yemen, since, the, 5th, century, bce, and, form, part, of, the, historic, jewish, diasporas, in, sana, a, jews, had, initially, settled, within, the, enclosed, citadel, known, as, al, qa, r, near, the, ruins, of, the, old, tower, known, as, ghumdan, palace, but, were, evicted, from, there, in, the, late, 6th, century, by, the, ruling, monarch, and, moved, to, a, different, section, of, the, city, known, as, al, marbaki, also, called, the, falayhi, quarter, from, there, they, again, uprooted, and, were, made, to, settle, in, the, section, of, the, city, known, as, al, quzali, and, eventually, moved, and, settled, in, the, neighborhood, of, al, sa, ilah, in, 1679, during, the, mawza, exile, they, were, once, again, evicted, from, their, place, of, residence, upon, returning, to, the, city, in, 1680, they, were, given, a, plot, of, land, outside, of, the, city, walls, where, they, built, the, new, jewish, quarter, al, q, now, q, al, ulufi, and, where, they, remained, until, the, community, s, demise, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, 1839, the, reverend, joseph, wolff, who, later, went, to, bukhara, to, attempt, to, save, lieutenant, colonel, charles, stoddart, and, captain, arthur, conolly, found, in, yemen, near, sana, a, a, tribe, claiming, to, be, descendants, of, jehonadab, after, the, creation, of, the, political, state, of, israel, in, 1948, about, 49, 000, of, an, estimated, 51, 000, of, yemenite, jews, were, airlifted, to, israel, almost, 10, 000, of, whom, were, from, sana, a, see, the, english, language, book, jews, and, muslims, in, lower, yemen, a, study, in, protection, and, restraint, 1918, 1949, there, was, then, essentially, no, jewish, population, in, sana, a, until, the, shia, insurgency, broke, out, in, northern, yemen, in, 2004, the, houthis, directly, threatened, the, jewish, community, in, 2007, prompting, the, government, of, president, saleh, to, offer, them, refuge, in, sana, a, as, of, 2010, around, 700, jews, were, living, in, the, capital, under, government, protection, in, april, 2017, it, was, reported, that, 40, of, the, last, 50, jews, were, in, an, enclave, next, to, the, american, embassy, in, sana, a, and, they, were, subject, to, threats, of, ethnic, cleansing, by, the, houthis, on, 28, april, 2020, yemenite, minister, moammer, al, iryani, remarked, the, fate, of, the, last, 50, jews, in, yemen, is, unknown, on, 16, july, 2020, 5, jews, were, allowed, to, leave, yemen, by, the, houthi, leaving, 33, jews, in, the, country, in, july, 2020, the, mona, relief, reported, on, their, website, that, as, of, july, 19, 2020, of, the, jewish, population, in, yemen, there, were, only, a, handful, of, jews, in, sana, a, historically, sana, a, had, a, mining, industry, the, hills, around, sana, a, were, mined, for, onyx, chalcedony, and, cornelian, the, city, also, traded, in, agricultural, products, and, due, to, being, on, the, route, from, aden, towards, the, greater, arab, world, was, also, a, main, market, for, imported, western, goods, the, city, was, also, known, for, its, metalwork, which, the, british, described, as, famous, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, declining, in, popularity, as, of, 1920, sana, a, was, described, by, the, british, as, being, well, supplied, with, fruit, and, grapes, and, has, good, water, as, the, capital, city, of, yemen, nearly, 40, of, jobs, in, sana, a, are, in, the, public, sector, the, city, is, also, an, important, centre, for, commerce, and, industry, in, yemen, additionally, like, many, other, cities, in, the, developing, world, sana, a, has, a, large, informal, sector, that, is, estimated, to, constitute, 32, of, nongovernmental, employment, as, of, 2002, by, far, the, largest, area, of, the, economy, both, in, terms, of, the, number, of, businesses, and, jobs, is, in, commerce, and, small, services, as, of, 2004, 58, 9, of, all, establishments, and, 31, 3, of, all, jobs, in, sanaa, belong, to, this, category, another, major, category, is, general, administration, which, only, makes, up, 0, 8, of, employers, but, has, 18, 0, of, workers, making, it, the, second, largest, in, that, regard, manufacturing, is, the, third, largest, category, by, both, measures, with, about, 12, for, both, sanaa, also, has, a, higher, concentration, of, hotels, and, restaurants, than, elsewhere, in, the, country, about, 62, of, jobs, in, sanaa, are, working, for, private,

with, none, employing, more, than, 2, sanaa, s, economy, is, large, compared, to, its, population, as, of, 2004, it, was, home, to, only, 9, of, yemen, s, population, but, 16, of, the, country, s, businesses, and, 22, of, its, formal, sector, jobs, the, average, size, of, a, business, establishment, in, sanaa, is, small, at, 3, 88, employees, on, average, however, this, is, higher, than, the, national, average, of, 2, 87, and, only, aden, has, a, higher, average, of, 6, 88, employees, between, 1992, and, 2006, 39, of, all, new, formal, sector, jobs, in, yemen, were, created, in, sanaa, along, with, 33, of, new, business, establishments, in, terms, of, jobs, created, sanaa, is, ahead, of, all, other, governorates, in, yemen, by, a, factor, of, three, while, sanaa, has, a, vibrant, diverse, economy, with, more, jobs, being, created, than, anywhere, else, in, yemen, it, also, has, the, highest, concentration, of, poverty, in, the, country, it, is, home, to, 6, 5, of, the, country, s, total, poor, population, and, 23, of, the, poor, urban, population, about, 15, of, the, city, s, population, lives, below, the, national, poverty, line, as, of, 2007, there, are, also, many, people, living, just, above, the, poverty, line, who, are, still, in, a, relatively, precarious, financial, position, high, unemployment, is, another, problem, by, some, estimates, as, much, as, 25, of, sanaa, s, potential, workforce, is, unemployed, income, inequality, is, also, increasing, from, 1998, to, 2005, the, gini, coefficient, for, sanaa, increased, from, 37, to, 44, a, 21, increase, the, highest, in, the, country, high, inflation, low, per, capita, income, growth, and, disproportionate, gains, by, the, rich, have, contributed, to, a, middle, class, squeeze, in, sanaa, s, middle, class, since, the, 1980s, a, 2005, survey, of, 488, yemeni, firms, by, the, mitsubishi, research, institute, included, a, subset, of, 175, firms, in, sanaa, they, reported, similar, challenges, in, doing, business, with, firms, throughout, the, country, in, particular, corruption, is, a, problem, in, their, dealings, with, the, government, and, hefty, bribes, are, often, a, necessity, certain, businesses, can, use, their, connections, to, dodge, taxes, and, regulations, which, puts, other, businesses, at, a, disadvantage, because, they, have, to, abide, by, the, rules, long, delays, for, customs, clearances, especially, for, imports, are, ubiquitous, and, over, 70, of, the, surveyed, firms, reported, that, they, had, made, extra, legal, payments, to, customs, officials, financial, constraints, also, confront, many, entrepreneurs, in, sanaa, the, cost, of, bank, credit, is, also, prohibitively, high, and, loan, guarantees, often, comes, with, heavy, demands, that, are, difficult, to, meet, shortcomings, in, municipal, infrastructure, are, another, problem, for, example, because, access, to, electricity, is, unreliable, many, firms, have, to, install, their, own, backup, generators, before, the, civil, war, yemen, s, electricity, was, primarily, supplied, by, the, ma, rib, gas, fired, power, plant, which, came, online, in, 2009, and, supplied, 27, to, 40, percent, of, the, country, s, electricity, while, active, before, that, the, power, came, from, six, diesel, power, plants, in, sanaa, itself, the, ma, rib, plant, is, connected, to, the, bani, hushaysh, substation, by, a, power, line, with, a, capacity, of, 400, kv, and, the, bani, hushaysh, substation, is, then, connected, to, substations, in, dhahban, and, hizyaz, by, two, 132, kv, lines, however, the, ma, rib, sanaa, power, line, was, frequently, targeted, by, attacks, there, were, 54, attacks, on, the, power, line, between, 2010, and, 2013, the, ma, rib, plant, ceased, operations, in, 2015, the, dhahban, and, hizyaz, substations, also, have, generating, capacity, in, addition, to, being, supplied, by, the, ma, rib, plant, the, dhahban, station, is, the, main, one, in, sanaa, located, 10, km, northwest, of, the, city, it, had, an, original, generating, capacity, of, 20, mw, with, another, 30, mw, installed, during, the, 2000s, bringing, the, total, to, 50, mw, the, hizyaz, station, consists, of, three, power, plants, the, first, with, a, capacity, of, 30, mw, was, completed, in, 2002, another, 60, mw, plant, was, added, in, 2004, and, then, in, 2007, the, third, plant, with, a, capacity, of, 30, mw, was, also, completed, while, most, of, prewar, sanaa, was, connected, to, the, electrical, grid, including, at, least, partial, coverage, in, most, of, the, city, s, 35, informal, settlements, access, to, electricity, was, unreliable, power, outages, were, common, and, one, 2011, report, suggested, that, electricity, was, only, available, for, one, hour, per, day, the, civil, war, has, severely, impacted, the, energy, sector, in, yemen, due, to, several, factors, including, damage, from, attacks, lack, of, funding, for, maintenance, and, fuel, shortages, as, of, 2018, 43, of, sanaa, s, energy, assets, were, destroyed, while, another, 38, had, suffered, partial, damage, in, addition, 81, of, the, facilities, were, not, functioning, as, a, result, the, public, power, supply, in, sanaa, has, become, almost, nonexistent, of, the, daily, 500, mw, electricity, demand, in, the, city, the, city, receives, 40, mw, the, public, electricity, supply, is, now, mostly, or, entirely, supplied, by, the, hizyaz, station, whose, capacity, has, been, reduced, to, 7, mw, public, grid, access, covers, around, 2, of, the, population, mostly, in, nearby, neighborhoods, and, it, is, expensive, for, consumers, private, services, using, their, generators, also, sell, electricity, to, customers, they, cover, another, 2, 8, and, cost, about, as, much, as, the, public, supply, the, largest, share, of, electrical, supply, in, sanaa, came, from, privately, owned, solar, panels, and, diesel, generators, which, together, covered, 30, of, the, population, solar, power, rapidly, gained, popularity, in, yemen, in, 2015, and, in, 2016, it, became, the, leading, source, of, electricity, in, the, country, prices, of, fuel, and, diesel, in, yemen, have, risen, dramatically, since, the, start, of, the, war, current, prices, are, 150, of, what, they, were, in, 2017, the, most, recent, crisis, in, sanaa, came, in, september, 2019, leading, to, days, long, lines, at, gas, stations, black, market, prices, can, be, three, times, higher, than, the, official, ones, leaving, many, unable, to, afford, fuel, distribution, of, education, levels, among, sanaa, residents, in, 2004, sanaa, is, relatively, well, educated, among, yemeni, cities, and, much, more, than, the, country, as, a, whole, private, education, is, highly, desired, by, more, affluent, residents, but, access, to, it, is, nowhere, near, as, good, as, in, other, capital, cities, in, the, region, each, of, sanaa, s, districts, has, its, educational, district, with, several, government, schools, in, each, one, the, war, in, yemen, has, severely, affected, education, in, sanaa, after, the, internationally, recognized, government, relocated, the, national, bank, from, sanaa, to, aden, in, 2016, it, stopped, paying, salaries, to, public, sector, employees, in, houthi, controlled, areas, many, teachers, quit, teaching, because, of, this, and, they, were, replaced, by, inexperienced, volunteers, sanaa, university, was, established, in, 1970, to, prepare, yemenis, to, work, as, teachers, as, of, 1984, it, remained, the, only, higher, education, institute, in, yemen, in, that, time, its, enrolment, had, grown, from, 68, students, in, 1970, 71, to, around, 9, 700, in, 1983, 84, during, its, early, years, sanaa, university, was, largely, financed, by, kuwait, and, most, professors, administrators, and, teaching, materials, came, from, kuwait, as, well, as, of, the, 1980s, most, professors, came, from, ain, shams,

summer, session, as, of, 1984, instruction, was, in, arabic, in, all, faculties, except, for, the, faculty, of, science, where, it, was, done, in, english, the, then, planned, faculties, of, engineering, and, medical, sciences, were, also, planned, to, have, instruction, done, in, english, as, of, 1984, one, in, five, freshmen, at, sanaa, university, went, on, to, graduate, in, four, years, the, statistic, for, students, who, graduated, after, more, than, four, years, was, not, given, as, of, october, 2016, there, are, 88, health, facilities, in, the, sanaa, metro, area, these, include, 5, primary, level, health, units, covering, 1, 000, 5, 000, people, each, 56, health, centres, covering, over, 50, 000, people, each, higher, than, the, national, average, of, 36, 340, as,

each, the, hospitals, have, on, average, 6, 9, beds, per, 10, 000, people, which, is, slightly, above, the, national, average, of, 6, 2, but, well, below, the, recommended, minimum, of, 10, as, of, 2016, there, are, also, 25, ambulances, in, the, city, as, of, 2019, 77, healthcare, facilities, in, sanaa, are, supported, by, health, cluster, partners, including, provision, of, outpatient, consultations, medical, interventions, fuel, and, water, support, and, staff, training, sanaa, s, healthcare, providers, also, serve, people, from, surrounding, governorates, it, is, one, of, two, yemeni, cities, offering, tertiary, healthcare, services, the, largest, of, the, country, s, 6, blood, transfusion, centres, is, located, at, sanaa, s, as, sabeen, maternal, hospital, additionally, most, of, yemen, s, 40, providers, of, psychiatric, care, are, located, in, sanaa, as, of, 2016, the, ongoing, conflict, has, severely, affected, the, health, sector, in, sanaa, in, 2018, the, total, cost, of, damage, to, the, health, sector, in, sanaa, was, estimated, to, be, between, 191, million, and, us, 233, million, as, of, 2016, there, was, a, ratio, of, 20, healthcare, workers, for, every, 10, 000, people, this, ratio, had, decreased, to, 14, by, 2018, well, below, the, world, health, organization, s, recommended, minimum, of, 22, health, staff, per, 10, 000, people, there, are, severe, shortages, of, medicines, in, sanaa, with, 57, types, of, cancer, medicines, and, 8, kidney, dialysis, medicines, being, commercially, unavailable, those, medicines, that, are, available, are, subjected, to, large, price, increases, on, 27, april, 2018, as, sabeen, maternal, hospital, was, hit, by, an, airstrike, and, made, inoperational, as, of, 2020, no, information, is, available, about, its, status, additionally, the, closure, of, sanaa, international, airport, to, commercial, flights, in, august, 2016, prevented, yemenis, from, traveling, abroad, to, receive, specialized, medical, treatment, unavailable, in, the, country, before, it, shut, down, an, estimated, 7, 000, yemenis, traveled, through, the, airport, to, do, so, including, treatment, for, heart, kidney, and, liver, conditions, blood, conditions, and, cancer, sanaa, has, been, hit, hard, by, the, ongoing, cholera, outbreak, in, yemen, since, 2016, with, bani, al, harith, district, reporting, the, highest, number, of, cases, in, january, august, 2019, the, amanat, al, asimah, governorate, also, had, the, second, highest, number, of, measles, cases, in, yemen, in, 2019, behind, only, saada, governorate, in, may, 2020, during, the, coronavirus, pandemic, the, local, houthi, authorities, responded, by, closing, down, several, markets, and, locking, down, streets, in, 10, districts, after, suspected, cases, rose, at, the, same, time, however, they, have, been, suppressing, all, information, about, the, scale, of, the, outbreak, refusing, to, release, positive, test, results, and, intimidating, medical, staff, journalists, and, families, to, prevent, them, from, speaking, out, about, cases, speaking, about, the, coronavirus, testing, results, one, official, quipped, when, it, s, negative, they, give, the, results, to, us, as, of, may, 2020, the, only, hospital, in, sanaa, that, has, the, full, capacity, to, treat, coronavirus, is, the, kuwait, university, hospital, an, influx, of, patients, entered, this, hospital, in, the, first, week, of, may, and, health, workers, believe, many, of, them, had, coronavirus, houthi, authorities, never, revealed, the, test, results, but, an, internal, document, from, 4, may, 2020, showing, three, positive, test, results, was, circulated, widely, on, social, media, transport, in, sanaa, is, divided, by, gender, with, a, slight, majority, 51, of, male, commuters, using, public, transport, and, a, similar, majority, 56, of, women, travelling, on, foot, in, both, cases, using, personally, owned, cars, was, less, prevalent, than, public, transport, 51, vs, 29, for, men, and, 25, vs, 20, for, women, use, of, bicycles, and, motorcycles, is, less, only, 5, of, male, commuters, and, a, negligible, percentage, of, female, commuters, reported, using, them, as, primary, modes, of, transport, public, transport, in, sanaa, is, primarily, informal, with, most, vehicles, being, privately, owned, common, passenger, vehicles, include, microbuses, dabab, s, which, in, 2005, were, estimated, to, number, 4, 7, 000, in, sanaa, minibuses, nuss, bus, estimated, at, 5, 500, 7, 300, and, taxis, which, are, more, common, at, around, 33, 000, public, transport, in, the, city, center, is, well, developed, with, frequently, available, bus, and, minibus, services, and, several, bus, terminals, most, terminals, are, informal, but, the, sanaa, outskirts, are, poorly, served, by, comparison, and, often, people, must, walk, long, distances, to, reach, one, of, the, major, roads, most, routes, are, short, meaning, that, longer, north, south, trips, require, switching, buses, multiple, times, additionally, the, number, of, buses, on, the, roads, can, vary, from, day, to, day, since, bus, driver, licenses, do, not, require, drivers, to, operate, on, a, regular, schedule, this, can, lead, to, long, waiting, times, there, are, also, coaches, to, major, cities, such, as, aden, and, taiz, sanaa, has, an, extensive, road, network, which, is, where, most, formal, investment, has, taken, place, the, city, s, roads, are, mostly, north, south, with, two, major, ring, roads, traversing, the, city, the, highest, volumes, of, traffic, are, within, the, inner, ring, road, roads, are, often, congested, which, is, compounded, by, the, fact, that, many, of, the, city, s, 33, 000, taxi, cabs, often, operate, empty, and, there, is, a, high, level, of, air, pollution, as, a, result, this, air, pollution, is, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, like, mexico, city, or, kathmandu, sanaa, is, located, in, an, upland, bowl, surrounded, by, mountains, which, creates, thermal, inversions, that, trap, pollutants, sanaa, has, the, most, traffic, accidents, in, yemen, with, 2, 898, in, 2013, more, than, twice, as, many, as, ta, izz, which, had, the, second, highest, total, contributing, factors, include, lax, enforcement, of, traffic, laws, lack, of, traffic, signals, lack, of, pedestrian, crossings, and, bad, parking, practices, for, example, double, parking, is, common, even, when, there, are, available, parking, spaces, nearby, the, number, of, traffic, accidents, plummeted, in, 2015, by, more, than, 50, as, the, escalation, of, the, conflict, in, yemen, led, to, reduced, mobility, as, well, as, fuel, shortages, which, led, to, decreased, use, of, personal, vehicles, in, 2017, the, saudi, blockade, of, yemen, caused, fuel, costs, to, rise, by, over, 100, in, sanaa, crippling, transport, systems, and, making, it, even, harder, for, people, to, access, clean, water, food, and, healthcare, by, august, 2019, the, price, of, diesel, had, reached, 430, riyals, per, liter, which, was, a, 186, 7, increase, from, the, pre, war, price, at, the, same, time, the, price, of, gasoline, had, risen, to, 365, riyals, per, liter, which, was, a, 143, 3, increase, over, the, same, period, sanaa, international, airport, is, yemen, s, main, domestic, and, international, airport, handling, 80, of, all, air, passengers, in, the, country, in, 2007, the, airport, sustained, heavy, damage, during, the, ongoing, conflict, in, yemen, and, has, been, closed, for, commercial, flights, since, august, 2016, this, has, prevented, many, yemenis, from, being, able, to, travel, abroad, to, receive, medical, treatment, in, addition, at, the, start, of, the, saudi, blockade, the, sanaa, airport, was, completely, shut, down, for, 16, days, until, being, reopened, to, humanitarian, flights, on, the, 22nd, of, november, a, new, sanaa, airport, started, construction, in, 2008, but, stopped, in, 2011, and, has, not, resumed, since, yemenia, the, national, airline, of, yemen, has, its, head, office, in, sanaa, most, of, yemen, s, telecommunications, infrastructure, is, located, in, sanaa, as, are, most, of, the, country, s, telecommunications, companies, the, internet, was, first, launched, in, yemen, in, 1996, but, it, was, used, by, under, 5, of, the, population, until, 2007, the, percentage, of, yemenis, using, the, internet, nationwide, has, increased, from, 1, 25, in, 2006, to, 26, 72, in, 2017, in, sanaa, the, main, internet, service, provider, is, yemennet, which, was, launched, in, 2002, and, is, the, only, network, offering, 3g, services, internet, cafes, are, popular, among, sanaa, residents, many, of, whom, cannot, afford, the, high, cost, of, subscription, fees, and, purchasing, necessary, equipment, they, are, especially, popular, with, university, students, who, use, publicly, available, information, on, the, internet, to, supplement, their, studies, the, first, all, female, internet, cafe, in, sanaa, opened, in, 2013, as, of, 2017, the, city, of, sanaa, had, 407, internet, cafes, which, was, almost, a, third, of, the, total, in, yemen, a, survey, of, 45, internet, cafes, in, 2018, reported, that, 38, were, fully, or, partially, operating, while, 7, were, permanently, closed, one, of, them, was, operating, on, solar, power, which, provided, 18, hours, of, electricity, per, day, yemen, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, water, scarce, countries, and, sanaa, could, be, the, first, national, capital, in, the, world, to, completely, exhaust, its, water, supply, the, city, is, located, on, the, tawilah, aquifer, which, was, first, identified, in, 1972, the, aquifer, has, a, natural, recharge, rate, of, 42, mm, 3, a, much, of, which, comes, from, the, periodic, outflow, of, water, from, the, surrounding, wadis, onto, the, sanaa, plain, there, is, not, much, refill, from, rainfall, in, 1995, water, extraction, from, the, aquifer, exceeded, the, natural, recharge, rate, by, around, 300, more, recent, estimates, are, higher, suggesting, 400, 500, this, has, caused, groundwater, levels, to, drop, by, 6, to, 8, metres, annually, to, the, point, that, many, wells, have, to, be, drilled, as, far, down, as, 2, 600, to, 3, 900, feet, it, is, estimated, that, with, a, slightly, lower, rate, of, depletion, the, aquifer, will, be, completely, exhausted, by, around, 2030, as, much, as, 90, of, yemen, s, water, use, is, in, agriculture, with, irrigated, farmland, increasing, from, 37, 000, hectares, in, 1970, to, 407, 000, in, 2004, before, the, 1970s, traditional, agricultural, practices, had, a, sustainable, balance, of, use, and, recharge, household, water, in, sanaa, was, supplied, by, shallow, wells, and, the, relative, scarcity, of, water, led, to, people, using, gray, water, for, watering, gardens, meanwhile, agriculture, in, the, surrounding, rural, areas, was, watered, by, rainfall, with, terracing, and, flood, diversion, systems, making, as, much, as, possible, out, of, the, limited, rainwater, however, after, the, introduction, of, deep, tube, wells, and, the, identification, of, the, tawilah, aquifer, there, was, an, explosion, of, agriculture, in, the, sanaa, area, by, 1995, there, were, over, 5, 000, wells, in, the, sanaa, area, as, of, 2010, the, number, was, about, 13, 500, at, the, same, time, traditionally, grown, drought, resistant, crops, have, been, largely, replaced, by, more, water, intensive, cash, crops, such, as, citrus, bananas, grapes, vegetables, and, especially, qat, which, as, of, 2010, accounted, for, 6, of, yemen, s, entire, gdp, in, the, sanaa, area, 27, of, all, farmland, was, dedicated, to, growing, qat, by, 2010, the, number, had, increased, to, around, 50, in, the, city, of, sanaa, itself, there, was, a, continuous, expansion, of, tap, water, supply, under, the, national, water, and, sanitation, authority, nswa, through, the, end, of, the, 1990s, but, it, was, outpaced, by, the, city, s, growth, the, public, water, supply, only, served, 40, 50, of, sanaa, residents, by, 2000, the, percentage, has, decreased, in, recent, years, in, 2009, it, was, estimated, that, 55, of, residents, were, connected, to, the, public, water, supply, in, 2018, only, 43, did, for, residents, without, access, to, the, municipal, water, network, the, only, option, for, drinking, water, is, from, tanker, trucks, which, is, expensive, access, to, tap, water, is, also, inconsistent, between, neighborhoods, and, even, in, places, where, there, is, public, water, water, pressure, can, be, too, low, resulting, in, unreliable, access, for, some, households, most, households, have, access, to, water, for, less, than, one, full, day, per, week, there, are, also, problems, with, pipe, leakage, with, estimates, ranging, from, 40, to, 60, of, water, being, lost, due, to, leaks, additionally, there, are, problems, with, water, quality, in, sanaa, due, to, wastewater, getting, into, water, pipes, and, also, leaching, down, into, the, aquifer, a, 2018, study, found, the, water, exceeded, the, limits, for, dissolved, solids, and, coliform, bacteria, including, e, coli, sana, nis, tend, to, view, the, city, s, tap, water, as, contaminated, choosing, instead, to, buy, filtered, water, in, containers, for, drinking, and, cooking, which, costs, significantly, more, private, kiosks, using, reverse, osmosis, to, filter, poor, quality, groundwater, are, also, popular, as, of, 2009, the, average, domestic, water, consumption, in, sanaa, was, just, 30, to, 50, liters, per, day, which, is, far, below, the, usual, amount, for, city, dwellers, in, the, middle, east, in, the, pre, modern, era, sanaa, used, an, irrigation, called, ghayls, these, ran, from, external, towns, in, peripheral, areas, and, brought, water, into, the, city, they, were, responsible, for, much, of, sanaa, s, water, supply, for, most, of, its, history, the, sewer, systems, in, sanaa, is, over, 500, kilometres, long, there, are, two, activated, sludge, water, treatment, plants, in, the, city, the, main, one, in, bani, al, harith, district, was, commissioned, in, 2000, and, has, a, daily, capacity, of, 50, 500m, 3, the, second, in, al, hashishiyah, is, much, smaller, with, a, capacity, of, 500m, 3, and, is, dedicated, to, collecting, wastewater, from, tankers, no, damage, was, reported, to, the, bani, al, harith, water, treatment, plant, as, of, 2018, and, it, remains, in, operation, although, overloaded, and, with, some, equipment, in, poor, condition, the, al, hashishiyah, facility, has, been, out, of,
