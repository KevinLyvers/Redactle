political, and, social, turmoil, that, extended, until, 2011, ivory, coast, has, experienced, again, high, economic, growth, since, the, return, of, peace, and, political, stability, in, 2011, from, 2012, to, 2023, the, economy, grew, by, an, average, of, 7, 1, per, year, in, real, terms, the, second, fastest, rate, of, economic, growth, in, africa, and, fourth, fastest, rate, in, the, world, in,

centuries, divided, the, west, coast, of, africa, very, roughly, into, four, coasts, reflecting, resources, available, from, each, coast, the, coast, that, the, french, named, the, c, te, d, ivoire, and, the, portuguese, named, the, costa, do, marfim, both, meaning, coast, of, ivory, lay, between, what, was, known, as, the, guin, de, cabo, verde, so, called, upper, guinea, at, cap, vert, and,

name, ivory, coast, reflected, the, major, trade, that, occurred, on, that, particular, stretch, of, the, coast, the, export, of, ivory, other, names, for, the, area, included, the, c, te, de, dents, literally, coast, of, teeth, again, reflecting, the, ivory, trade, the, c, te, de, quaqua, after, the, people, whom, the, dutch, named, the, quaqua, alternatively, kwa, kwa, the, coast, of, the, five,

century, usage, switched, to, c, te, d, ivoire, the, coastline, of, the, modern, state, is, not, quite, coterminous, with, what, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, merchants, knew, as, the, teeth, or, ivory, coast, which, was, considered, to, stretch, from, cape, palmas, to, cape, three, points, and, which, is, thus, now, divided, between, the, modern, states, of, ghana, and, ivory, coast, with, a, minute, portion, of, liberia, it, retained, the, name, through, french, rule, and, independence, in, 1960, the, name, had, long, since, been, translated, literally, into, other, languages, which, the, post, independence, government, considered, increasingly, troublesome, whenever, its, international, dealings, extended, beyond, the, francophone, sphere, therefore, in, april, 1986, the, government, declared, that, c, te, d, ivoire, or, more, fully, r, publique, de, c, te, d, ivoire, would, be, its, formal, name, for, the, purposes, of, diplomatic, protocol, and, has, since, officially, refused,

the, ivory, coast, is, still, frequently, used, in, english, by, various, media, outlets, and, publications, the, first, human, presence, in, ivory, coast, has, been, difficult, to, determine, because, human, remains, have, not, been, well, preserved, in, the, country, s, humid, climate, however, newly, found, weapon, and, tool, fragments, specifically, polished, axes, cut, through, shale, and, remnants, of, cooking, and, fishing, have, been, interpreted, as, a, possible, indication, of, a, large, human, presence, during, the, upper, paleolithic, period, 15, 000, to, 10, 000, bc, or, at, the, minimum, the, neolithic, period, the, earliest, known, inhabitants, of, the, ivory, coast, have, left, traces, scattered, throughout, the, territory, historians, believe, that, they, were, all, either, displaced, or, absorbed, by, the, ancestors, of, the, present, indigenous, inhabitants, who, migrated, south, into, the, area, before, the, 16th, century, such, groups, included, the,

edge, of, the, desert, and, from, there, supplemental, trade, extended, as, far, south, as, the, edge, of, the, rainforest, the, most, important, terminals, djenn, gao, and, timbuctu, grew, into, major, commercial, centres, around, which, the, great, sudanic, empires, developed, by, controlling, the, trade, routes, with, their, powerful, military, forces, these, empires, were, able, to, dominate, neighbouring, states, the, sudanic, empires, also, became, centres, of, islamic, education, islam, had, been, introduced, in, the, western, sudan, by, muslim, berbers, it, spread, rapidly, after, the, conversion, of, many, important, rulers, from, the, 11th, century, by, which, time, the, rulers, of, the, sudanic, empires, had, embraced, islam, it, spread, south, into, the, northern, areas, of, contemporary, ivory, coast, the, ghana, empire, the, earliest, of, the, sudanic, empires, flourished, in, the, region, encompassing, present, day, southeast, mauritania, and, southern, mali, between, the, 4th, and, 13th, centuries, at, the, peak, of, its, power, in, the, 11th, century, its, realms, extended, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, timbuktu, after, the, decline, of, ghana, the, mali, empire, grew, into, a, powerful, muslim, state, which, reached, its, apogee, in, the, early, part, of, the, 14th, century, the, territory, of, the, mali, empire, in, the, ivory, coast, was, limited, to, the, northwest, corner, around, odienn, its, slow, decline, starting, at, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, followed, internal, discord, and, revolts, by, vassal, states, one, of, which, songhai, flourished, as, an, empire, between, the, 14th, and, 16th, centuries, songhai, was, also, weakened, by, internal, discord, which, led, to, factional, warfare, this, discord, spurred, most, of, the, migrations, southward, toward, the, forest, belt, the, dense, rainforest, covering, the, southern, half, of, the, country, created, barriers, to, the, large, scale, political, organizations, that, had, arisen, in, the, north, inhabitants, lived, in, villages, or, clusters, of, villages, their, contacts, with, the, outside, world, were, filtered, through, long, distance, traders, villagers, subsisted, on, agriculture, and, hunting, five, important, states, flourished, in, ivory, coast, during, the, pre, european, early, modern, period, the, muslim, kong, empire, was, established, by, the, dyula, in, the, early, 18th, century, in, the, north, central, region, inhabited, by, the, s, noufo, who, had, fled, islamization, under, the, mali, empire, although, kong, became, a, prosperous, centre, of, agriculture, trade, and, crafts, ethnic, diversity, and, religious, discord, gradually, weakened, the, kingdom, in, 1895, the, city, of, kong, was, sacked, and, conquered, by, samori, ture, of, the, wassoulou, empire, the, abron, kingdom, of, gyaaman, was, established, in, the, 17th, century, by, an, akan, group, the, abron, who, had, fled, the, developing, ashanti, confederation, of, asanteman, in, what, is, present, day, ghana, from, their, settlement, south, of, bondoukou, the, abron, gradually, extended, their, hegemony, over, the, dyula, people, in, bondoukou, who, were, recent, arrivals, from, the, market, city, of, begho, bondoukou, developed, into, a, major, centre, of, commerce, and, islam, the, kingdom, s, quranic, scholars, attracted, students, from, all, parts, of, west, africa, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, east, central, ivory, coast, other, akan, groups, fleeing, the, asante, established, a, baoul, kingdom, at, sakasso, and, two, agni, kingdoms, ind, ni, and, sanwi, the, baoul, like, the, ashanti, developed, a, highly, centralised, political, and, administrative, structure, under, three, successive, rulers, it, finally, split, into, smaller, chiefdoms, despite, the, breakup, of, their, kingdom, the, baoul, strongly, resisted, french, subjugation, the, descendants, of, the, rulers, of, the, agni, kingdoms, tried, to, retain, their, separate, identity, long, after, ivory, coast, s, independence, as, late, as, 1969, the, sanwi, attempted, to, break, away, from, ivory, coast, and, form, an, independent, kingdom, compared, to, neighbouring, ghana, ivory, coast, though, practising, slavery, and, slave, raiding, suffered, little, from, the, slave, trade, european, slave, and, merchant, ships, preferred, other, areas, along, the, coast, the, earliest, recorded, european, voyage, to, west, africa, was, made, by, the, portuguese, in, 1482, the, first, west, african, french, settlement, saint, louis, was, founded, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, senegal, while, at, about, the, same, time, the, dutch, ceded, to, the, french, a, settlement, at, gor, e, island, off, dakar, a, french, mission, was, established, in, 1687, at, assinie, near, the, border, with, the, gold, coast, now, ghana, the, europeans, suppressed, the, local, practice, of, slavery, at, this, time, and, forbade, the, trade, to, their, merchants, assinie, s, survival, was, precarious, however, the, french, were, not, firmly, established, in, ivory, coast, until, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1843, 44, french, admiral, louis, douard, bou, t, willaumez, signed, treaties, with, the, kings, of, the, grand, bassam, and, assinie, regions, making, their, territories, a, french, protectorate, french, explorers, missionaries, trading, companies, and, soldiers, gradually, extended, the, area, under, french, control, inland, from, the, lagoon, region, pacification, was, not, accomplished, until, 1915, activity, along, the, coast, stimulated, european, interest, in, the, interior, especially, along, the, two, great, rivers, the, senegal, and, the, niger, concerted, french, exploration, of, west, africa, began, in, the, mid, 19th, century, but, moved, slowly, based, more, on, individual, initiative, than, on, government, policy, in, the, 1840s, the, french, concluded, a, series, of, treaties, with, local, west, african, chiefs, that, enabled, the, french, to, build, fortified, posts, along, the, gulf, of, guinea, to, serve, as, permanent, trading, centres, the, first, posts, in, ivory, coast, included, one, at, assinie, and, another, at, grand, bassam, which, became, the, colony, s, first, capital, the, treaties, provided, for, french, sovereignty, within, the, posts, and, for, trading, privileges, in, exchange, for, fees, or, coutumes, paid, annually, to, the, local, chiefs, for, the, use, of, the, land, the, arrangement, was, not, entirely, satisfactory, to, the, french, because, trade, was, limited, and, misunderstandings, over, treaty, obligations, often, arose, nevertheless, the, french, government, maintained, the, treaties, hoping, to, expand, trade, france, also, wanted, to, maintain, a, presence, in, the, region, to, stem, the, increasing, influence, of, the, british, along, the, gulf, of, guinea, coast, the, defeat, of, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1871, and, the, subsequent, annexation, by, germany, of, the, french, province, of, alsace, lorraine, initially, caused, the, french, government, to, abandon, its, colonial, ambitions, and, withdraw, its, military, garrisons, from, its, west, african, trading, posts, leaving, them, in, the, care, of, resident, merchants, the, trading, post, at, grand, bassam, was, left, in, the, care, of, a, shipper, from, marseille, arthur, verdier, who, in, 1878, was, named, resident, of, the, establishment, of, ivory, coast, in, 1886, to, support, its, claims, of, effective, occupation, france, again, assumed, direct, control, of, its, west, african, coastal, trading, posts, and, embarked, on, an, accelerated, program, of, exploration, in, the, interior, in, 1887, lieutenant, louis, gustave, binger, began, a, two, year, journey, that, traversed, parts, of, ivory, coast, s, interior, by, the, end, of, the, journey, he, had, concluded, four, treaties, establishing, french, protectorates, in, ivory, coast, also, in, 1887, verdier, s, agent, marcel, treich, lapl, ne, negotiated, five, additional, agreements, that, extended, french, influence, from, the, headwaters, of, the, niger, river, basin, through, ivory, coast, by, the, end, of, the, 1880s, france, had, established, control, over, the, coastal, regions, and, in, 1889, britain, recognized, french, sovereignty, in, the, area, that, same, year, france, named, treich, lapl, ne, the, titular, governor, of, the, territory, in, 1893, ivory, coast, became, a, french, colony, with, its, capital, in, grand, bassam, and, captain, binger, was, appointed, governor, agreements, with, liberia, in, 1892, and, with, britain, in, 1893, determined, the, eastern, and, western, boundaries, of, the, colony, but, the, northern, boundary, was, not, fixed, until, 1947, because, of, efforts, by, the, french, government, to, attach, parts, of, upper, volta, present, day, burkina, faso, and, french, sudan, present, day, mali, to, ivory, coast, for, economic, and, administrative, reasons, france, s, main, goal, was, to, stimulate, the, production, of, exports, coffee, cocoa, and, palm, oil, crops, were, soon, planted, along, the, coast, ivory, coast, stood, out, as, the, only, west, african, country, with, a, sizeable, population, of, european, settlers, elsewhere, in, west, and, central, africa, europeans, who, emigrated, to, the, colonies, were, largely, bureaucrats, as, a, result, french, citizens, owned, one, third, of, the, cocoa, coffee, and, banana, plantations, and, adopted, the, local, forced, labour, system, throughout, the, early, years, of, french, rule, french, military, contingents, were, sent, inland, to, establish, new, posts, the, african, population, resisted, french, penetration, and, settlement, even, in, areas, where, treaties, of, protection, had, been, in, force, among, those, offering, the, greatest, resistance, was, samori, ture, who, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, was, establishing, the, wassoulou, empire, which, extended, over, large, parts, of, present, day, guinea, mali, burkina, faso, and, ivory, coast, ture, s, large, well, equipped, army, which, could, manufacture, and, repair, its, own, firearms, attracted, strong, support, throughout, the, region, the, french, responded, to, ture, s, expansion, and, conquest, with, military, pressure, french, campaigns, against, ture, which, were, met, with, fierce, resistance, intensified, in, the, mid, 1890s, until, he, was, captured, in, 1898, and, his, empire, dissolved, france, s, imposition, of, a, head, tax, in, 1900, to, support, the, colony, s, public, works, program, provoked, protests, many, ivorians, saw, the, tax, as, a, violation, of, the, protectorate, treaties, because, they, felt, that, france, was, demanding, the, equivalent, of, a, coutume, from, the, local, kings, rather, than, the, reverse, many, especially, in, the, interior, also, considered, the, tax, a, humiliating, symbol, of, submission, in, 1905, the, french, officially, abolished, slavery, in, most, of, french, west, africa, from, 1904, to, 1958, ivory, coast, was, part, of, the, federation, of, french, west, africa, it, was, a, colony, and, an, overseas, territory, under, the, third, republic, in, world, war, i, france, organized, regiments, from, ivory, coast, to, fight, in, france, and, colony, resources, were, rationed, from, 1917, to, 1919, until, the, period, following, world, war, ii, governmental, affairs, in, french, west, africa, were, administered, from, paris, france, s, policy, in, west, africa, was, reflected, mainly, in, its, philosophy, of, association, meaning, that, all, africans, in, ivory, coast, were, officially, french, subjects, but, without, rights, to, representation, in, africa, or, france, french, colonial, policy, incorporated, concepts, of, assimilation, and, association, based, on, the, assumed, superiority, of, french, culture, in, practice, the, assimilation, policy, meant, the, extension, of, the, french, language, institutions, laws, and, customs, to, the, colonies, the, policy, of, association, also, affirmed, the, superiority, of, the, french, in, the, colonies, but, it, entailed, different, institutions, and, systems, of, laws, for, the, colonizer, and, the, colonized, under, this, policy, the, africans, in, ivory, coast, were, allowed, to, preserve, their, own, customs, insofar, as, they, were, compatible, with, french, interests, an, indigenous, elite, trained, in, french, administrative, practice, formed, an, intermediary, group, between, french, and, africans, after, 1930, a, small, number, of, westernized, ivorians, were, granted, the, right, to, apply, for, french, citizenship, most, ivorians, however, were, classified, as, french, subjects, and, were, governed, under, the, principle, of, association, as, subjects, of, france, natives, outside, the, civilized, elite, had, no, political, rights, they, were, drafted, for, work, in, mines, on, plantations, as, porters, and, on, public, projects, as, part, of, their, tax, responsibility, they, were, expected, to, serve, in, the, military, and, were, subject, to, the, indig, nat, a, separate, system, of, law, during, world, war, ii, the, vichy, regime, remained, in, control, until, 1943, when, members, of, general, charles, de, gaulle, s, provisional, government, assumed, control, of, all, french, west, africa, the, brazzaville, conference, of, 1944, the, first, constituent, assembly, of, the, fourth, republic, in, 1946, and, france, s, gratitude, for, african, loyalty, during, world, war, ii, led, to, far, reaching, governmental, reforms, in, 1946, french, citizenship, was, granted, to, all, african, subjects, the, right, to, organize, politically, was, recognized, and, various, forms, of, forced, labour, were, abolished, between, 1944, and, 1946, many, national, conferences, and, constituent, assemblies, took, place, between, france, s, government, and, provisional, governments, in, ivory, coast, governmental, reforms, were, established, by, late, 1946, which, granted, french, citizenship, to, all, african, subjects, under, the, colonial, control, of, the, french, until, 1958, governors, appointed, in, paris, administered, the, colony, of, ivory, coast, using, a, system, of, direct, centralized, administration, that, left, little, room, for, ivorian, participation, in, policy, making, the, french, colonial, administration, also, adopted, divide, and, rule, policies, applying, ideas, of, assimilation, only, to, the, educated, elite, the, french, were, also, interested, in, ensuring, that, the, small, but, influential, ivorian, elite, was, sufficiently, satisfied, with, the, status, quo, to, refrain, from, developing, anti, french, sentiments, and, calls, for, independence, although, strongly, opposed, to, the, practices, of, association, educated, ivorians, believed, that, they, would, achieve, equality, in, the, french, colonial, system, through, assimilation, rather, than, through, complete, independence, from, france, after, the, assimilation, doctrine, was, implemented, through, the, postwar, reforms, though, ivorian, leaders, realized, that, even, assimilation, implied, the, superiority, of, the, french, over, the, ivorians, and, that, discrimination, and, inequality, would, end, only, with, independence, f, lix, houphou, t, boigny, the, son, of, a, baoul, chief, became, ivory, coast, s, father, of, independence, in, 1944, he, formed, the, country, s, first, agricultural, trade, union, for, african, cocoa, farmers, like, himself, angered, that, colonial, policy, favoured, french, plantation, owners, the, union, members, united, to, recruit, migrant, workers, for, their, own, farms, houphou, t, boigny, soon, rose, to, prominence, and, was, elected, to, the, french, parliament, in, paris, within, a, year, a, year, later, the, french, abolished, forced, labour, houphou, t, boigny, established, a, strong, relationship, with, the, french, government, expressing, a, belief, that, ivory, coast, would, benefit, from, the, relationship, which, it, did, for, many, years, france, appointed, him, as, a, minister, the, first, african, to, become, a, minister, in, a, european, government, a, turning, point, in, relations, with, france, was, reached, with, the, 1956, overseas, reform, act, loi, cadre, which, transferred, several, powers, from, paris, to, elected, territorial, governments, in, french, west, africa, and, also, removed, the, remaining, voting, inequities, on, 4, december, 1958, ivory, coast, became, an, autonomous, member, of, the, french, community, which, had, replaced, the, french, union, by, 1960, the, country, was, easily, french, west, africa, s, most, prosperous, contributing, over, 40, of, the, region, s, total, exports, when, houphou, t, boigny, became, the, first, president, his, government, gave, farmers, good, prices, for, their, products, to, further, stimulate, production, which, was, further, boosted, by, a, significant, immigration, of, workers, from, surrounding, countries, coffee, production, increased, significantly, catapulting, ivory, coast, into, third, place, in, world, output, behind, brazil, and, colombia, by, 1979, the, country, was, the, world, s, leading, producer, of, cocoa, it, also, became, africa, s, leading, exporter, of, pineapples, and, palm, oil, french, technicians, contributed, to, the, ivorian, miracle, in, other, african, nations, the, people, drove, out, the, europeans, following, independence, but, in, ivory, coast, they, poured, in, the, french, community, grew, from, only, 30, 000, before, independence, to, 60, 000, in, 1980, most, of, them, teachers, managers, and, advisors, for, 20, years, the, economy, maintained, an, annual, growth, rate, of, nearly, 10, the, highest, of, africa, s, non, oil, exporting, countries, houphou, t, boigny, s, one, party, rule, was, not, amenable, to, political, competition, laurent, gbagbo, who, would, become, the, president, of, ivory, coast, in, 2000, had, to, flee, the, country, in, the, 1980s, after, he, incurred, the, ire, of, houphou, t, boigny, by, founding, the, front, populaire, ivoirien, houphou, t, boigny, banked, on, his, broad, appeal, to, the, population, who, continued, to, elect, him, he, was, criticized, for, his, emphasis, on, developing, large, scale, projects, many, felt, the, millions, of, dollars, spent, transforming, his, home, village, yamoussoukro, into, the, new, political,
