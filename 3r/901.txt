new, town, symbolic, of, the, freedom, of, india, unfettered, by, the, traditions, of, the, past, an, expression, of, the, nation, s, faith, in, the, future, for, nehru, chandigarh, represented, a, vision, of, how, a, new, planned, city, could, be, a, canvas, for, the, regeneration, of, the, nation, itself, after, centuries, of, oppression, under, british, colonial, rule, and, the, dilution, of, indian, character, from, the, nation, s, towns, guided, by, the, architectural, optics, of, le, corbusier, the, development, of, chandigarh, was, part, of, a, state, driven, exercise, to, break, from, the, traditions, of, imperialism, in, city, making, and, begin, the, process, of, healing, from, the, injustices, suffered, to, the, extent, that, chandigarh, epitomises, the, destructive, influence, of, the, british, in, the, impetus, of, its, creation, as, a, solution, to, the, otherwise, violent, partitioning, of, territory, between, india, and, pakistan, it, represents, an, early, ideological, symbol, for, the, birth, of, india, s, future, the, selection, of, the, physical, site, involved, an, extensive, vetting, process, many, existing, towns, in, punjab, were, surveyed, as, options, for, the, new, capital, and, dismissed, for, poor, performance, concerning, factors, such, as, military, defensibility, and, capacity, for, accommodating, potential, refugee, influxes, the, construction, of, a, new, town, in, chandigarh, was, determined, to, be, the, best, option, due, to, its, relative, strength, in, these, factors, as, well, as, its, proximity, to, the, national, capital, new, delhi, its, central, location, within, the, state, of, punjab, its, abundance, of, fecund, land, and, its, beautiful, natural, landscape, off, the, back, of, this, conflation, of, assets, chandigarh, then, was, well, poised, to, serve, a, function, as, a, city, building, project, in, national, identity, from, a, federal, policy, perspective, the, development, of, the, new, town, became, a, tool, in, india, for, modernisation, and, an, intended, driver, of, economic, activity, legal, reform, and, regional, growth, as, well, as, a, significant, agent, for, the, decolonisation, project, as, britain, s, grip, on, their, empire, began, to, weaken, their, accelerated, withdrawal, between, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, and, 1947, left, their, former, colony, in, states, of, disarray, and, disorganisation, and, policymakers, for, the, new, indian, government, were, required, to, contend, with, issues, such, as, rapid, rural, depopulation, urban, congestion, and, poverty, as, well, as, in, chandigarh, this, policy, tool, was, implemented, in, the, creation, of, new, capital, cities, in, bhubaneswar, and, gandhinagar, and, more, broadly, throughout, india, in, the, 112, planned, cities, created, between, independence, and, 1971, purposed, to, absorb, migration, from, those, regions, in, demise, after, being, abandoned, by, the, british, and, provide, hubs, for, growing, industries, such, as, in, steel, and, energy, these, examples, from, a, genealogy, of, utopian, urban, forms, developed, in, post, independence, india, as, a, panacea, for, issues, related, to, underdevelopment, as, well, as, post, independence, complications, to, do, with, separatist, religious, conflict, and, the, resulting, diplomatic, tensions, chandigarh, is, the, first, example, of, a, state, funded, master, planned, modernisation, scheme, these, urban, utopias, attempt, to, enforce, nation, building, policies, through, a, federalised, rule, of, law, at, a, regional, level, and, diffuse, postcolonial, urbanism, which, codes, justice, in, its, design, the, intent, is, that, the, economic, success, and, progressivism, of, cities, such, as, chandigarh, as, a, lightning, rod, for, social, change, would, gradually, be, emulated, at, the, scale, of, the, nation, chandigarh, was, for, nehru, and, le, corbusier, an, embodiment, of, the, egalitarian, potential, offered, by, modernism, where, the, machine, age, would, complete, the, liberation, of, the, nation, s, citizens, through, the, productive, capacity, of, industrial, technology, and, the, relative, ease, of, constructing, civic, facilities, such, as, dams, hospitals, and, schools, the, very, antithesis, of, the, conservative, and, traditional, legacy, of, colonialism, though, built, as, a, state, capital, chandigarh, came, to, be, focused, on, industry, and, higher, education, the, specialisation, of, these, new, towns, in, particular, functions, represents, a, crucial, aspect, of, the, modernisation, process, as, a, decolonising, enterprise, in, completing, a, national, portfolio, where, each, town, forms, a, part, of, the, utopian, model, for, contemporary, india, the, post, colonialism, of, chandigarh, is, rooted, in, the, transformation, of, the, political, ideas, of, those, such, as, nehru, who, generated, a, new, indian, nationalism, through, the, design, of, newly, built, forms, scholars, such, as, edward, said, have, emphasised, the, sinister, nature, of, nostalgia, and, the, romanticisation, of, colonial, architecture, in, newly, independent, colonies, as, artefacts, that, perpetuate, the, ideological, legacy, of, the, hegemony, and, replicate, the, hierarchy, of, power, even, after, decolonisation, insofar, as, modernism, in, architecture, which, defined, town, planning, under, the, nehru, era, of, rule, represents, an, active, radical, break, from, tradition, and, a, colonial, past, even, the, very, presence, of, le, corbusier, has, been, recognised, as, an, indelible, resistance, to, the, british, construction, legacy, as, he, provided, the, first, non, british, influence, on, design, thinking, in, india, enabling, a, generational, shift, in, the, contemporary, cohort, of, architects, and, planners, to, be, hired, by, the, state, throughout, the, rest, of, the, century, who, were, initiated, under, modernist, conditioning, as, early, as, the, 1950s, the, presence, of, the, international, style, could, be, detected, in, the, design, of, houses, in, india, whether, mistri, or, architect, designed, the, development, of, low, cost, housing, was, a, priority, for, chandigarh, and, the, modern, forms, designed, by, corbusier, are, characterised, by, a, dispensing, with, colonial, forms, focused, on, classic, aesthetics, and, a, refocusing, on, strategies, such, as, using, narrow, frontages, and, orientation, for, minimising, direct, exposure, to, the, sun, and, maximising, natural, ventilation, and, efficient, cost, while, providing, modern, amenities, in, the, international, style, aesthetic, these, developments, are, credited, as, the, beginning, of, a, chandigarh, architecture, inspiring, gradual, experimentation, with, form, and, an, indianising, of, the, international, style, which, precipitated, the, formation, of, the, country, s, new, cultural, identity, in, town, design, in, 2024, tropical, modernism, architecture, and, independence, an, exhibition, at, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, london, featured, designs, for, chandigarh, criticisms, are, well, established, regarding, the, implementation, of, the, postcolonial, vision, of, nehru, and, le, corbusier, and, the, critical, emphasis, on, its, influence, claims, have, been, made, that, the, focus, on, corbusier, s, architect, centred, discourse, erases, the, plural, authorship, of, the, narrative, of, chandigarh, s, development, arguing, that, it, was, in, fact, a, hybridity, of, values, and, of, contested, modernities, of, western, and, indigenous, indian, origin, and, cultural, exchanges, rather, than, an, uncontested, administrative, enterprise, such, criticism, is, consistent, with, claims, that, decolonisation, in, india, has, marked, a, shift, from, segregation, based, on, race, to, segregation, based, on, class, and, that, planned, cities, are, truly, designed, ones, which, represent, the, values, and, interests, of, a, westernised, middle, class, indian, elite, which, ignore, the, complexities, of, india, s, diverse, ethnic, and, cultural, landscape, and, enabled, neocolonial, hierarchies, such, as, the, imposition, of, the, hindi, language, on, non, conforming, castes, brent, c, brolin, argues, that, le, corbusier, ignored, indian, preferences, in, designing, the, housing, and, communities, and, that, the, residents, have, done, what, they, can, to, recreate, their, accustomed, lifestyle, furthermore, the, early, over, saturation, of, the, minimalist, international, style, in, building, design, in, chandigarh, has, attracted, criticisms, of, effecting, a, democratic, self, effacing, banality, though, this, criticism, is, perhaps, negligent, of, how, this, was, necessary, for, galvanising, higher, standards, of, urban, living, throughout, the, country, list, of, films, chandrawal, jagat, jakhar
