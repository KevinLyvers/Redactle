the, euphrates, ju, f, r, e, t, i, z, yoo, fray, teez, see, below, is, the, longest, and, one, of, the, most, historically, important, rivers, of, western, asia, together, with, the, tigris, it, is, one, of, the, two, defining, rivers, of, mesopotamia, lit, the, land, between, the, rivers, originating, in, turkey, the, euphrates, flows, through, syria, and, iraq, to, join, the, tigris, in, the, shatt, al, arab, in, iraq, which, empties, into, the, persian, gulf, the, euphrates, is, the, fifteenth, longest, river, in, asia, and, the, longest, in, western, asia, at, about, 2, 780, km, 1, 730, mi, with, a, drainage, area, of, 440, 000, km, 2, 170, 000, sq, mi, that, covers, six, countries, the, term, euphrates, derives, from, the, greek, euphr, t, s, adapted, from, old, persian, romanized, h, ufr, tu, itself, from, elamite, romanized, ipratui, the, elamite, name, is, ultimately, derived, from, cuneiform, read, as, buranun, in, sumerian, and, purattu, in, akkadian, many, cuneiform, signs, have, a, sumerian, pronunciation, and, an, akkadian, pronunciation, taken, from, a, sumerian, word, and, an, akkadian, word, that, mean, the, same, the, akkadian, purattu, has, been, perpetuated, in, semitic, languages, cf, arabic, al, fur, t, syriac, p, r, hebrew, p, r, and, in, other, nearby, languages, of, the, time, cf, hurrian, puranti, sabarian, uruttu, the, elamite,

copper, sumerian, urudu, as, an, origin, with, an, explanation, that, euphrates, was, the, river, by, which, copper, ore, was, transported, in, rafts, since, mesopotamia, was, the, center, of, copper, metallurgy, during, the, period, the, euphrates, is, called, yeprat, in, armenian, perat, in, modern, hebrew, f, rat, in, turkish, and, firat, in, kurdish, the, mandaic, name, is, pra, and, is, often, mentioned, as, pra, ziwa, pronounced, fra, ziwa, in, mandaean, scriptures, such, as, the, ginza, rabba, in, mandaean, scriptures, the, euphrates, is, considered, to, be, the, earthly, manifestation, of, the, heavenly, yardna, or, flowing, river, similar, to, the, yazidi, concept, of, lalish, being, the, earthly, manifestation, of, its, heavenly, counterpart, or, the, sacred, house, kaaba, in, mecca, being, the, earthly, manifestation, of, the, heavenly, al, bayt, al, mamur, the, earliest, references, to, the, euphrates, come, from, cuneiform, texts, found, in, shuruppak, and, pre, sargonic, nippur, in, southern, iraq, and, date, to, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bce, in, these, texts, written, in, sumerian, the, euphrates, is, called, buranuna, logographic, ud, kib, nun, the, name, could, also, be, written, kib, nun, na, or, d, kib, nun, with, the, prefix, d, indicating, that, the, river, was, a, divinity, in, sumerian, the, name, of, the, city, of, sippar, in, modern, day, iraq, was, also, written, ud, kib, nun, indicating, a, historically, strong, relationship, between, the, city, and, the, river, the, euphrates, is, the, longest, river, of, western, asia, it, emerges, from, the, confluence, of, the, kara, su, or, western, euphrates, 450, kilometres, 280, mi, and, the, murat, su, or, eastern, euphrates, 650, kilometres, 400, mi, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, upstream, from, the, town, of, keban, in, southeastern, turkey, daoudy, and, frenken, put, the, length, of, the, euphrates, from, the, source, of, the, murat, river, to, the, confluence, with, the, tigris, at, 3, 000, kilometres, 1, 900, mi, of, which, 1, 230, kilometres, 760, mi, is, in, turkey, 710, kilometres, 440, mi, in, syria, and, 1, 060, kilometres, 660, mi, in, iraq, the, same, figures, are, given, by, isaev, and, mikhailova, the, length, of, the, shatt, al, arab, which, connects, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, with, the, persian, gulf, is, given, by, various, sources, as, 145, 195, kilometres, 90, 121, mi, both, the, kara, su, and, the, murat, su, rise, northwest, from, lake, van, at, elevations, of, 3, 290, metres, 10, 790, ft, and, 3, 520, metres, 11, 550, ft, amsl, respectively, at, the, location, of, the, keban, dam, the, two, rivers, now, combined, into, the, euphrates, have, dropped, to, an, elevation, of, 693, metres, 2, 274, ft, amsl, from, keban, to, the, syrian, turkish, border, the, river, drops, another, 368, metres, 1, 207, ft, over, a, distance, of, less, than, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, once, the, euphrates, enters, the, upper, mesopotamian, plains, its, grade, drops, significantly, within, syria, the, river, falls, 163, metres, 535, ft, while, over, the, last, stretch, between, h, t, and, the, shatt, al, arab, the, river, drops, only, 55, metres, 180, ft, the, euphrates, receives, most, of, its, water, in, the, form, of, rainfall, and, melting, snow, resulting, in, peak, volumes, during, the, months, april, through, may, discharge, in, these, two, months, accounts, for, 36, percent, of, the, total, annual, discharge, of, the, euphrates, or, even, 60, 70, percent, according, to, one, source, while, low, runoff, occurs, in, summer, and, autumn, the, average, natural, annual, flow, of, the, euphrates, has, been, determined, from, early, and, mid, twentieth, century, records, as, 20, 9, cubic, kilometres, 5, 0, cu, mi, at, keban, 36, 6, cubic, kilometres, 8, 8, cu, mi, at, h, t, and, 21, 5, cubic, kilometres, 5, 2, cu, mi, at, hindiya, however, these, averages, mask, the, high, inter, annual, variability, in, discharge, at, birecik, just, north, of, the, syro, turkish, border, annual, discharges, have, been, measured, that, ranged, from, a, low, volume, of, 15, 3, cubic, kilometres, 3, 7, cu, mi, in, 1961, to, a, high, of, 42, 7, cubic, kilometres, 10, 2, cu, mi, in, 1963, the, discharge, regime, of, the, euphrates, has, changed, dramatically, since, the, construction, of, the, first, dams, in, the, 1970s, data, on, euphrates, discharge, collected, after, 1990, show, the, impact, of, the, construction, of, the, numerous, dams, in, the, euphrates, and, of, the, increased, withdrawal, of, water, for, irrigation, average, discharge, at, h, t, after, 1990, has, dropped, to, 356, cubic, metres, 12, 600, cu, ft, per, second, 11, 2, cubic, kilometres, 2, 7, cu, mi, per, year, the, seasonal, variability, has, equally, changed, the, pre, 1990, peak, volume, recorded, at, h, t, was, 7, 510, cubic, metres, 265, 000, cu, ft, per, second, while, after, 1990, it, is, only, 2, 514, cubic, metres, 88, 800, cu, ft, per, second, the, minimum, volume, at, h, t, remained, relatively, unchanged, rising, from, 55, cubic, metres, 1, 900, cu, ft, per, second, before, 1990, to, 58, cubic, metres, 2, 000, cu, ft, per, second, afterward, in, syria, three, rivers, add, their, water, to, the, euphrates, the, sajur, the, balikh, and, the, khabur, these, rivers, rise, in, the, foothills, of, the, taurus, mountains, along, the, syro, turkish, border, and, add, comparatively, little, water, to, the, euphrates, the, sajur, is, the, smallest, of, these, tributaries, emerging, from, two, streams, near, gaziantep, and, draining, the, plain, around, manbij, before, emptying, into, the, reservoir, of, the, tishrin, dam, the, balikh, receives, most, of, its, water, from, a, karstic, spring, near, ayn, al, arus, and, flows, due, south, until, it, reaches, the, euphrates, at, the, city, of, raqqa, in, terms, of, length, drainage, basin, and, discharge, the, khabur, is, the, largest, of, these, three, its, main, karstic, springs, are, located, around, ra, s, al, ayn, from, where, the, khabur, flows, southeast, past, al, hasakah, where, the, river, turns, south, and, drains, into, the, euphrates, near, busayrah, once, the, euphrates, enters, iraq, there, are, no, more, natural, tributaries, to, the, euphrates, although, canals, connecting, the, euphrates, basin, with, the, tigris, basin, exist, the, drainage, basins, of, the, kara, su, and, the, murat, river, cover, an, area, of, 22, 000, square, kilometres, 8, 500, sq, mi, and, 40, 000, square, kilometres, 15, 000, sq, mi, respectively, estimates, of, the, area, of, the, euphrates, drainage, basin, vary, widely, from, a, low, 233, 000, square, kilometres, 90, 000, sq, mi, to, a, high, 766, 000, square, kilometres, 296, 000, sq, mi, recent, estimates, put, the, basin, area, at, 388, 000, square, kilometres, 150, 000, sq, mi, 444, 000, square, kilometres, 171, 000, sq, mi, and, 579, 314, square, kilometres, 223, 674, sq, mi, the, greater, part, of, the, euphrates, basin, is, located, in, turkey, syria, and, iraq, according, to, both, daoudy, and, frenken, turkey, s, share, is, 28, percent, syria, s, is, 17, percent, and, that, of, iraq, is, 40, percent, isaev, and, mikhailova, estimate, the, percentages, of, the, drainage, basin, lying, within, turkey, syria, and, iraq, at, 33, 20, and, 47, percent, respectively, some, sources, estimate, that, approximately, 15, percent, of, the, drainage, basin, is, located, within, saudi, arabia, while, a, small, part, falls, inside, the, borders, of, kuwait, finally, some, sources, also, include, jordan, in, the, drainage, basin, of, the, euphrates, a, small, part, of, the, eastern, desert, 220, square, kilometres, 85, sq, mi, drains, toward, the, east, rather, than, to, the, west, in, 2021, the, iraqi, ministry, of, water, resources, reported, that, the, euphrates, river, could, dry, out, by, 2040, due, to, climate, change, and, droughts, the, euphrates, flows, through, a, number, of, distinct, vegetation, zones, although, millennia, long, human, occupation, in, most, parts, of, the, euphrates, basin, has, significantly, degraded, the, landscape, patches, of, original, vegetation, remain, the, steady, drop, in, annual, rainfall, from, the, sources, of, the, euphrates, toward, the, persian, gulf, is, a, strong, determinant, for, the, vegetation, that, can, be, supported, in, its, upper, reaches, the, euphrates, flows, through, the, mountains, of, southeast, turkey, and, their, southern, foothills, which, support, a, xeric, woodland, plant, species, in, the, moister, parts, of, this, zone, include, various, oaks, pistachio, trees, and, rosaceae, rose, plum, family, the, drier, parts, of, the, xeric, woodland, zone, supports, less, dense, oak, forest, and, rosaceae, here, can, also, be, found, the, wild, variants, of, many, cereals, including, einkorn, wheat, emmer, oat, and, rye, south, of, this, zone, lies, a, zone, of, mixed, woodland, steppe, vegetation, between, raqqa, and, the, syro, iraqi, border, the, euphrates, flows, through, a, steppe, landscape, this, steppe, is, characterised, by, white, wormwood, artemisia, herba, alba, and, amaranthaceae, throughout, history, this, zone, has, been, heavily, overgrazed, due, to, the, practicing, of, sheep, and, goat, pastoralism, by, its, inhabitants, southeast, of, the, border, between, syria, and, iraq, starts, true, desert, this, zone, supports, either, no, vegetation, at, all, or, small, pockets, of, chenopodiaceae, or, poa, sinaica, although, today, nothing, of, it, survives, due, to, human, interference, research, suggests, that, the, euphrates, valley, would, have, supported, a, riverine, forest, species, characteristic, of, this, type, of, forest, include, the, oriental, plane, the, euphrates, poplar, the, tamarisk, the, ash, and, various, wetland, plants, among, the, fish, species, in, the, tigris, euphrates, basin, the, family, of, the, cyprinidae, are, the, most, common, with, 34, species, out, of, 52, in, total, among, the, cyprinids, the, mangar, has, good, recreational, fishing, qualities, leading, the, british, to, nickname, it, the, tigris, salmon, the, euphrates, softshell, turtle, is, an, endangered, soft, shelled, turtle, that, is, limited, to, the, tigris, euphrates, river,

the, syrian, euphrates, basin, reported, on, an, abundance, of, animals, living, in, the, area, many, of, which, have, become, rare, or, even, extinct, species, like, gazelle, onager, and, the, now, extinct, arabian, ostrich, lived, in, the, steppe, bordering, the, euphrates, valley, while, the, valley, itself, was, home, to, the, wild, boar, carnivorous, species, include, the, wolf, the, golden, jackal, the, red, fox, the, leopard, and, the, lion, the, syrian, brown, bear, can, be, found, in, the, mountains, of, southeast, turkey, the, presence, of, eurasian, beaver, has, been, attested, in, the, bone, assemblage, of, the, prehistoric, site, of, tell, abu, hureyra, in, syria, but, the, beaver, has, never, been, sighted, in, historical, times, the, hindiya, barrage, on, the, iraqi, euphrates, based, on, plans, by, british, civil, engineer, william, willcocks, and, finished, in, 1913, was, the, first, modern, water, diversion, structure, built, in, the, tigris, euphrates, river, system, the, hindiya, barrage, was, followed, in, the, 1950s, by, the, ramadi, barrage, and, the, nearby, abu, dibbis, regulator, which, serve, to, regulate, the, flow, regime, of, the, euphrates, and, to, discharge, excess, flood, water, into, the, depression, that, is, now, lake, habbaniyah, iraq, s, largest, dam, on, the, euphrates, is, the, haditha, dam, a, 9, kilometre, long, 5, 6, mi, earth, fill, dam, creating, lake, qadisiyah, syria, and, turkey, built, their, first, dams, in, the, euphrates, in, the, 1970s, the, tabqa, dam, in, syria, was, completed, in, 1973, while, turkey, finished, the, keban, dam, a, prelude, to, the, immense, southeastern, anatolia, project, in, 1974, since, then, syria, has, built, two, more, dams, in, the, euphrates, the, baath, dam, and, the, tishrin, dam, and, plans, to, build, a, fourth, dam, the, halabiye, dam, between, raqqa, and, deir, ez, zor, the, tabqa, dam, is, syria, s, largest, dam, and, its, reservoir, lake, assad, is, an, important, source, of, irrigation, and, drinking, water, it, was, planned, that, 640, 000, hectares, 2, 500, sq, mi, should, be, irrigated, from, lake, assad, but, in, 2000, only, 100, 000, 124, 000, hectares, 390, 480, sq, mi, had, been, realized, syria, also, built, three, smaller, dams, on, the, khabur, and, its, tributaries, with, the, implementation, of, the, southeastern, anatolia, project, turkish, g, neydo, u, anadolu, projesi, or, gap, in, the, 1970s, turkey, launched, an, ambitious, plan, to, harness, the, waters, of, the, tigris, and, the, euphrates, for, irrigation, and, hydroelectricity, production, and, provide, an, economic, stimulus, to, its, southeastern, provinces, gap, affects, a, total, area, of, 75, 000, square, kilometres, 29, 000, sq, mi, and, approximately, 7, million, people, representing, about, 10, percent, of, turkey, s, total, surface, area, and, population, respectively, when, completed, gap, will, consist, of, 22, dams, including, the, keban, dam, and, 19, power, plants, and, provide, irrigation, water, to, 1, 700, 000, hectares, 6, 600, sq, mi, of, agricultural, land, which, is, about, 20, percent, of, the, irrigable, land, in, turkey, c, 910, 000, hectares, 3, 500, sq, mi, of, this, irrigated, land, is, located, in, the, euphrates, basin, by, far, the, largest, dam, in, gap, is, the, atat, rk, dam, located, c, 55, kilometres, 34, mi, northwest, of, anl, urfa, this, 184, and, 1, 820, metre, long, 604, and, 5, 971, ft, dam, was, completed, in, 1992, thereby, creating, a, reservoir, that, is, the, third, largest, lake, in, turkey, with, a, maximum, capacity, of, 48, 7, cubic, kilometres, 11, 7, cu, mi, the, atat, rk, dam, reservoir, is, large, enough, to, hold, the, entire, annual, discharge, of, the, euphrates, completion, of, gap, was, scheduled, for, 2010, but, has, been, delayed, because, the, world, bank, has, withheld, funding, due, to, the, lack, of, an, official, agreement, on, water, sharing, between, turkey, and, the, downstream, states, on, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, apart, from, barrages, and, dams, iraq, has, also, created, an, intricate, network, of, canals, connecting, the, euphrates, with, lake, habbaniyah, lake, tharthar, and, abu, dibbis, reservoir, all, of, which, can, be, used, to, store, excess, floodwater, via, the, shatt, al, hayy, the, euphrates, is, connected, with, the, tigris, the, largest, canal, in, this, network, is, the, main, outfall, drain, or, so, called, third, river, constructed, between, 1953, and, 1992, this, 565, kilometre, long, 351, mi, canal, is, intended, to, drain, the, area, between, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, south, of, baghdad, to, prevent, soil, salinization, from, irrigation, it, also, allows, large, freight, barges, to, navigate, up, to, baghdad, the, construction, of, the, dams, and, irrigation, schemes, on, the, euphrates, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, environment, and, society, of, each, riparian, country, the, dams, constructed, as, part, of, gap, in, both, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, basins, have, affected, 382, villages, and, almost, 200, 000, people, have, been, resettled, elsewhere, the, largest, number, of, people, was, displaced, by, the, building, of, the, atat, rk, dam, which, alone, affected, 55, 300, people, a, survey, among, those, who, were, displaced, showed, that, the, majority, were, unhappy, with, their, new, situation, and, that, the, compensation, they, had, received, was, considered, insufficient, the, flooding, of, lake, assad, led, to, the, forced, displacement, of, c, 4, 000, families, who, were, resettled, in, other, parts, of, northern, syria, as, part, of, a, now, abandoned, plan, to, create, an, arab, belt, along, the, borders, with, turkey, and, iraq, apart, from, the, changes, in, the, discharge, regime, of, the, river, the, numerous, dams, and, irrigation, projects, have, also, had, other, effects, on, the, environment, the, creation, of, reservoirs, with, large, surfaces, in, countries, with, high, average, temperatures, has, led, to, increased, evaporation, thereby, reducing, the, total, amount, of, water, that, is, available, for, human, use, annual, evaporation, from, reservoirs, has, been, estimated, at, 2, cubic, kilometres, 0, 48, cu, mi, in, turkey, 1, cubic, kilometre, 0, 24, cu, mi, in, syria, and, 5, cubic, kilometres, 1, 2, cu, mi, in, iraq, water, quality, in, the, iraqi, euphrates, is, low, because, irrigation, water, tapped, in, turkey, and, syria, flows, back, into, the, river, together, with, dissolved, fertilizer, chemicals, used, on, the, fields, the, salinity, of, euphrates, water, in, iraq, has, increased, as, a, result, of, upstream, dam, construction, leading, to, lower, suitability, as, drinking, water, the, many, dams, and, irrigation, schemes, and, the, associated, large, scale, water, abstraction, have, also, had, a, detrimental, effect, on, the, ecologically, already, fragile, mesopotamian, marshes, and, on, freshwater, fish, habitats, in, iraq, the, inundation, of, large, parts, of, the, euphrates, valley, especially, in, turkey, and, syria, has, led, to, the, flooding, of, many, archaeological, sites, and, other, places, of, cultural, significance, although, concerted, efforts, have, been, made, to, record, or, save, as, much, of, the, endangered, cultural, heritage, as, possible, many, sites, are, probably, lost, forever, the, combined, gap, projects, on, the, turkish, euphrates, have, led, to, major, international, efforts, to, document, the, archaeological, and, cultural, heritage, of, the, endangered, parts, of, the, valley, especially, the, flooding, of, zeugma, with, its, unique, roman, mosaics, by, the, reservoir, of, the, birecik, dam, has, generated, much, controversy, in, both, the, turkish, and, international, press, the, construction, of, the, tabqa, dam, in, syria, led, to, a, large, international, campaign, coordinated, by, unesco, to, document, the, heritage, that, would, disappear, under, the, waters, of, lake, assad, archaeologists, from, numerous, countries, excavated, sites, ranging, in, date, from, the, natufian, to, the, abbasid, period, and, two, minarets, were, dismantled, and, rebuilt, outside, the, flood, zone, important, sites, that, have, been, flooded, or, affected, by, the, rising, waters, of, lake, assad, include, mureybet, emar, and, abu, hureyra, a, similar, international, effort, was, made, when, the, tishrin, dam, was, constructed, which, led, among, others, to, the, flooding, of, the, important, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, site, of, jerf, el, ahmar, an, archaeological, survey, and, rescue, excavations, were, also, carried, out, in, the, area, flooded, by, lake, qadisiya, in, iraq, parts, of, the, flooded, area, have, recently, become, accessible, again, due, to, the, drying, up, of, the, lake, resulting, not, only, in, new, possibilities, for, archaeologists, to, do, more, research, but, also, providing, opportunities, for, looting, which, has, been, rampant, elsewhere, in, iraq, in, the, wake, of, the, 2003, invasion, in, islam, hadiths, say, muhammad, said, the, last, hour, would, not, come, before, the, euphrates, uncovers, a, mountain, of, gold, for, which, people, would, fight, ninety, nine, out, of, each, one, hundred, would, die, but, every, man, amongst, them, would, say, that, perhaps, he, would, be, the, one, who, would, be, saved, and, that, he, who, finds, it, should, not, take, anything, out, of, that, this, is, said, to, be, one, of, the, future, minor, signs, of, the, coming, of, judgement, day, in, the, christian, bible, the, euphrates, river, is, mentioned, in, revelation, 16, 12, in, the, final, book, of, the, new, testament, author, john, of, patmos, writes, about, the, euphrates, river, drying, up, as, part, of, a, series, of, events, that, foretell, the, second, coming, of, jesus, christ, the, river, phrath, mentioned, in, genesis, 2, 14, is, also, identified, as, the, euphrates, the, early, occupation, of, the, euphrates, basin, was, limited, to, its, upper, reaches, that, is, the, area, that, is, popularly, known, as, the, fertile, crescent, acheulean, stone, artifacts, have, been, found, in, the, sajur, basin, and, in, the, el, kowm, oasis, in, the, central, syrian, steppe, the, latter, together, with, remains, of, homo, erectus, that, were, dated, to, 450, 000, years, old, in, the, taurus, mountains, and, the, upper, part, of, the, syrian, euphrates, valley, early,
