the, great, rift, valley, swahili, bonde, la, ufa, is, a, series, of, contiguous, geographic, depressions, approximately, 6000, or, 7, 000, kilometres, 4, 300, mi, in, total, length, the, definition, varying, between, sources, that, runs, from, the, southern, turkish, hatay, province, in, asia, through, the, red, sea, to, mozambique, in, southeast, africa, while, the, name, continues, in, some, usages, it, is, rarely, used, in, geology, as, it, is, considered, an, imprecise, merging, of, separate, though, related, rift, and, fault, systems, this, valley, extends, southward, from, western, asia, into, the, eastern, part, of, africa, where, several, deep, elongated, lakes, called, ribbon, lakes, exist, on, the, rift, valley, floor, lake, malawi, and, lake, tanganyika, being, two, such, examples, the, region, has, a, unique, ecosystem, and, contains, a, number, of, africa, s, wildlife, parks, the, term, great, rift, valley, is, most, often, used, to, refer, to, the, valley, of, the, east, african, rift, the, divergent, plate, boundary, which, extends, from, the, afar, triple, junction, southward, through, eastern, africa, and, is, in, the, process, of, splitting, the, african, plate, into, two, new, and, separate, plates, geologists, generally, refer, to, these, evolving, plates, as, the, nubian, plate, and, the, somali, plate, today, these, rifts, and, faults, are, seen, as, distinct, although, connected, but, originally, the, great, rift, valley, was, thought, to, be, a, single, feature, that, extended, from, lebanon, in, the, north, to, mozambique, in, the, south, where, it, constitutes, one, of, two, distinct, physiographic, provinces, of, the, east, african, mountains, it, included, what, today, is, called, the, lebanese, section, of, the, dead, sea, transform, turkey, to, straits, if, tiran, the, jordan, rift, valley, geographic, term, for, section, including, entire, course, of, the, jordan, river, the, dead, sea, and, the, arabah, valley, red, sea, rift, and, the, east, african, rift, these, rifts, and, faults, were, formed, 35, million, years, ago, the, northernmost, part, of, the, rift, corresponds, to, the, central, section, of, what, is, called, today, the, dead, sea, transform, dst, or, rift, this, midsection, of, the, dst, forms, the, beqaa, valley, in, lebanon, separating, the, mount, lebanon, range, from, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, further, south, it, is, known, as, the, hula, valley, separating, the, galilee, mountains, and, the, golan, heights, the, jordan, river, begins, here, and, flows, southward, through, lake, hula, into, the, sea, of, galilee, in, israel, the, rift, then, continues, south, through, the, jordan, rift, valley, into, the, dead, sea, on, the, israeli, jordanian, border, from, the, dead, sea, southwards, the, rift, is, occupied, by, the, wadi, arabah, then, the, gulf, of, aqaba, and, then, the, red, sea, off, the, southern, tip, of, sinai, in, the, red, sea, the, dead, sea, transform, meets, the, red, sea, rift, which, runs, the, length, of, the, red, sea, the, red, sea, rift, comes, ashore, to, meet, the, east, african, rift, and, the, aden, ridge, in, the, afar, depression, of, east, africa, the, junction, of, these, three, rifts, is, called, the, afar, triple, junction, the, east, african, rift, follows, the, red, sea, to, the, end, before, turning, inland, into, the, ethiopian, highlands, dividing, the, country, into, two, large, and, adjacent, but, separate, mountainous, regions, in, kenya, uganda, and, the, fringes, of, south, sudan, the, great, rift, runs, along, two, separate, branches, that, are, joined, to, each, other, only, at, their, southern, end, in, southern, tanzania, along, its, border, with, zambia, the, two, branches, are, called, the, western, rift, valley, and, the, eastern, rift, valley, the, western, rift, also, called, the, albertine, rift, is, bordered, by, some, of, the, highest, mountains, in, africa, including, the, virunga, mountains, mitumba, mountains, and, ruwenzori, range, it, contains, the, rift, valley, lakes, which, include, some, of, the, deepest, lakes, in, the, world, up, to, 1, 470, metres, 4, 820, ft, deep, at, lake, tanganyika, much, of, this, area, lies, within, the, boundaries, of, national, parks, such, as, virunga, national, park, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, rwenzori, national, park, and, queen, elizabeth, national, park, in, uganda, and, volcanoes, national, park, in, rwanda, lake, victoria, is, considered, to, be, part, of, the, rift, valley, system, although, it, actually, lies, between, the, two, branches, all, of, the, african, great, lakes, were, formed, as, the, result, of, the, rift, and, most, lie, in, territories, within, the, rift, in, kenya, the, valley, is, deepest, to, the, north, of, nairobi, as, the, lakes, in, the, eastern, rift, have, no, outlet, to, the, sea, and, tend, to, be, shallow, they, have, a, high, mineral, content, as, the, evaporation, of, water, leaves, the, salts, behind, for, example, lake, magadi, has, high, concentrations, of, soda, sodium, carbonate, and, lake, elmenteita, lake, bogoria, and, lake, nakuru, are, all, strongly, alkaline, while, the, freshwater, springs, supplying, lake, naivasha, are, essential, to, support, its, current, biological, variety, the, southern, section, of, the, rift, valley, includes, lake, malawi, the, third, deepest, freshwater, body, in, the, world, which, reaches, 706, metres, 2, 316, ft, in, depth, and, separates, the, nyassa, plateau, of, northern, mozambique, from, malawi, the, rift, extends, southwards, from, lake, malawi, as, the, valley, of, the, shire, river, which, flows, from, the, lake, into, the, zambezi, river, the, rift, continues, south, of, the, zambezi, as, the, urema, valley, of, central, mozambique
