park, or, pleasuring, ground, for, the, benefit, and, enjoyment, of, the, people, in, 1872, although, yellowstone, was, not, officially, termed, a, national, park, at, the, time, in, practice, it, is, widely, held, to, be, the, first, and, oldest, national, park, in, the, world, however, the, tobago, main, ridge, forest, reserve, in, what, is, now, trinidad, and, tobago, established, in, 1776, and, the, area, surrounding, bogd, khan, uul, mountain, mongolia, 1778, which, were, restricted, from, cultivation, to, protect, surrounding, farmland, are, considered, the, oldest, legally, protected,

on, protected, areas, wcpa, have, defined, national, park, as, its, category, ii, type, of, protected, areas, according, to, the, iucn, 6, 555, national, parks, worldwide, met, its, criteria, in, 2006, iucn, is, still, discussing, the, parameters, of, defining, a, national, park, the, largest, national, park, in, the, world, meeting, the, iucn, definition, is, the, northeast, greenland, national, park, which, was, established, in, 1974, and, is, 972, 000, km, 2, 375, 000, sq, mi, in, area, in, 1969, the, iucn, declared, a, national, park, to, be, a, relatively, large, area, with, the, following, defining, characteristics, in, 1971, these, criteria, were, further, expanded, upon, leading, to, more, clear, and, defined, benchmarks, to, evaluate, a, national, park, these, include, while, the, term, national, park, is, now, defined, by, the, iucn, many, protected, areas, in, many, countries, are, called, national, park, even, when, they, correspond, to, other, categories, of, the, iucn, protected, area, management, definition, for, example, while, national, parks, are, generally, understood, to, be, administered, by, national, governments, hence, the, name, in, australia, with, the, exception, of, six, national, parks, national, parks, are, run, by, state, governments, and, predate, the, federation, of, australia, similarly, national, parks, in, the, netherlands, are, administered, by, the, provinces, in, canada, there, are, both, national, parks, operated, by, the, federal, government, and, provincial, or, territorial, parks, operated, by, the, provincial, and, territorial, governments, although, nearly, all, are, still, national, parks, by, the, iucn, definition, in, many, countries, including, indonesia, the, netherlands, and, the, united, kingdom, national, parks, do, not, adhere, to, the, iucn, definition, while, some, areas, which, adhere, to, the, iucn, definition, are, not, designated, as, national, parks, as, many, countries, do, not, adhere, to, the, iucn, definition, the, term, national, park, may, be, used, loosely, in, the, united, kingdom, and, in, some, other, countries, such, as, taiwan, a, national, park, simply, describes, a, general, area, that, is, relatively, undeveloped, scenic, and, attracts, tourists, with, some, form, of, planning, restrictions, to, ensure, it, maintains, those, characteristics, there, may, be, substantial, human, settlements, within, the, bounds, of, a, national, park, conversely, parks, that, meet, the, criteria, may, be, not, be, referred, to, as, national, parks, terms, like, preserve, or, reserve, may, be, used, instead, starting, in, 1735, the, naples, government, undertook, laws, to, protect, natural, areas, which, could, be, used, as, a, game, reserve, by, the, royal, family, procida, was, the, first, protected, site, the, difference, between, the, many, previous, royal, hunting, preserves, and, this, one, which, is, considered, to, be, closer, to, a, park, rather, than, a, hunting, preserve, is, that, neapolitan, government, already, considered, the, division, into, the, present, day, wilderness, areas, and, non, strict, nature, reserves, in, 1810, the, english, poet, william, wordsworth, described, the, lake, district, as, a, sort, of, national, property, in, which, every, man, has, a, right, and, interest, who, has, an, eye, to, perceive, and, a, heart, to, enjoy, the, painter, george, catlin, in, his, travels, through, the, american, west, wrote, during, the, 1830s, that, native, americans, in, the, united, states, might, be, preserved, by, some, great, protecting, policy, of, government, in, a, magnificent, park, a, nation, s, park, containing, man, and, beast, in, all, the, wild, and, freshness, of, their, nature, s, beauty, the, first, effort, by, the, u, s, federal, government, to, set, aside, such, protected, lands, was, on, 20, april, 1832, when, president, andrew, jackson, signed, legislation, that, the, 22nd, united, states, congress, had, enacted, to, set, aside, four, sections, of, land, around, what, is, now, hot, springs, arkansas, to, protect, the, natural, thermal, springs, and, adjoining, mountainsides, for, the, future, disposal, of, the, u, s, government, it, was, known, as, hot, springs, reservation, but, no, legal, authority, was, established, federal, control, of, the, area, was, not, clearly, established, until, 1877, the, work, of, important, leaders, who, fought, for, animal, and, land, conservation, were, essential, in, the, development, of, legal, action, some, of, these, leaders, include, president, abraham, lincoln, laurance, rockefeller, president, theodore, roosevelt, john, muir, and, first, lady, lady, bird, johnson, to, name, a, few, john, muir, is, today, referred, to, as, the, father, of, the, national, parks, due, to, his, work, in, yosemite, he, published, two, influential, articles, in, the, century, magazine, which, formed, the, base, for, the, subsequent, legislation, president, abraham, lincoln, signed, an, act, of, congress, on, 1, july, 1864, ceding, the, yosemite, valley, and, the, mariposa, grove, of, giant, sequoias, later, becoming, yosemite, national, park, to, the, state, of, california, according, to, this, bill, private, ownership, of, the, land, in, this, area, was, no, longer, possible, the, state, of, california, was, designated, to, manage, the, park, for, public, use, resort, and, recreation, leases, were, permitted, for, up, to, ten, years, and, the, proceeds, were, to, be, used, for, conservation, and, improvement, a, public, discussion, followed, this, first, legislation, of, its, kind, and, there, was, a, heated, debate, over, whether, the, government, had, the, right, to, create, parks, the, perceived, mismanagement, of, yosemite, by, the, californian, state, was, the, reason, why, yellowstone, was, put, under, national, control, at, its, establishment, six, years, later, in, 1872, yellowstone, national, park, was, established, as, the, united, states, first, national, park, being, also, the, world, s, first, national, park, in, some, european, and, asian, countries, however, national, protection, and, nature, reserves, already, existed, though, typically, as, game, reserves, and, recreational, grounds, set, aside, for, royalty, such, as, a, part, of, the, forest, of, fontainebleau, france, 1861, yellowstone, was, part, of, a, federally, governed, territory, with, no, state, government, that, could, assume, stewardship, of, the, land, the, federal, government, took, on, direct, responsibility, for, the, park, the, official, first, national, park, of, the, united, states, the, combined, effort, and, interest, of, conservationists, politicians, and, the, northern, pacific, railroad, ensured, the, passage, of, enabling, legislation, by, the, united, states, congress, to, create, yellowstone, national, park, theodore, roosevelt, and, his, group, of, conservationists, the, boone, and, crockett, club, were, active, campaigners, and, were, highly, influential, in, convincing, fellow, republicans, and, big, business, to, back, the, bill, yellowstone, national, park, soon, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, conservation, of, these, national, treasures, as, it, was, suffering, at, the, hands, of, poachers, and, others, who, stood, at, the, ready, to, pillage, what, they, could, from, the, area, theodore, roosevelt, and, his, newly, formed, boone, and, crockett, club, successfully, took, the, lead, in, protecting, yellowstone, national, park, from, this, plight, resulting, in, laws, designed, to, conserve, the, natural, resources, in, yellowstone, and, other, parks, under, the, government, s, purview, american, pulitzer, prize, winning, author, wallace,

use, national, park, in, its, creation, legislation, was, the, u, s, s, mackinac, national, park, in, 1875, the, area, was, later, transferred, to, the, state, s, authority, in, 1895, thus, losing, its, official, national, park, status, following, the, idea, established, in, yellowstone, and, mackinac, there, soon, followed, parks, in, other, nations, in, australia, what, is, now, royal,

about, during, the, american, frontier, and, were, meant, to, be, monuments, to, america, s, true, history, yet, in, some, instances, the, lands, that, were, to, be, set, aside, and, protected, in, formerly, colonized, lands, were, already, being, inhabited, by, native, communities, who, were, then, removed, off, of, these, lands, to, create, pristine, sites, for, public, consumption, critics, claim, that, the, removal, of, people, from, national, parks, enhances, the, belief, that, nature, can, only, be, protected, when, humans, do, not, exist, within, it, and, that, this, leads, to, perpetuating, the, dichotomy, between, nature, and, humans, also, known, as, the, nature, culture, divide, they, see, the, creation, of, national, parks, as, a, form, of, eco, land, grabbing, others, claim, that, traveling, to, national, parks, to, appreciate, nature, there, leads, people, to, ignore, the, nature, that, exists, around, them, every, day, still, others, argue, that, tourism, can, actually, negatively, impact, the, areas, that, are, being, visited
