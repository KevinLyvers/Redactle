the, congo, river, formerly, also, known, as, the, zaire, river, is, the, second, longest, river, in, africa, shorter, only, than, the, nile, as, well, as, the, third, largest, river, in, the, world, by, discharge, volume, following, the, amazon, and, ganges, rivers, it, is, the, world, s, deepest, recorded, river, with, measured, depths, of, around, 220, m, 720, ft, the, congo, lualaba, luvua, luapula, chambeshi, river, system, has, an, overall, length, of, 4, 700, km, 2, 900, mi, which, makes, it, the, world, s, ninth, longest, river, the, chambeshi, is, a, tributary, of, the, lualaba, river, and, lualaba, is, the, name, of, the, congo, river, upstream, of, boyoma, falls, extending, for, 1, 800, km, 1, 100, mi, measured, along, with, the, lualaba, the, main, tributary, the, congo, river, has, a, total, length, of, 4, 370, km, 2, 720, mi, it, is, the, only, major, river, to, cross, the, equator, twice, the, congo, basin, has, a, total, area, of, about, 4, 000, 000, km, 2, 1, 500, 000, sq, mi, or, 13, of, the, entire, african, landmass, the, name, congo, kongo, originates, from, the, kingdom, of, kongo, once, located, on, the, southern, bank, of, the, river, the, kingdom, in, turn, was, named, after, the, indigenous, bantu, kongo, people, known, in, the, 17th, century, as, esikongo, south, of, the, kingdom, of, kongo, proper, lay, the, similarly, named, kakongo, kingdom, mentioned, in, 1535, abraham, ortelius, labelled, manicongo, as, the, city, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, in, his, world, map, of, 1564, the, tribal, names, in, kongo, possibly, derive, from, a, word, for, a, public, gathering, or, tribal, assembly, the, modern, name, of, the, kongo, people, or, bakongo, was, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, name, zaire, is, from, a, portuguese, adaptation, of, a, kikongo, word, nzere, river, a, truncation, of, nzadi, o, nzere, river, swallowing, rivers, the, river, was, known, as, zaire, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, congo, seems, to, have, replaced, zaire, gradually, in, english, usage, during, the, 18th, century, and, congo, is, the, preferred, english, name, in, 19th, century, literature, although, references, to, zahir, or, zaire, as, the, name, used, by, the, inhabitants, remained, common, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, the, republic, of, the, congo, are, named, after, it, as, was, the, previous, republic, of, the, congo, which, had, gained, independence, in, 1960, from, the, belgian, congo, the, republic, of, zaire, during, 1971, 1997, was, also, named, after, the, river, s, name, in, french, and, portuguese, the, congo, s, drainage, basin, covers, 4, 014, 500, km, 2, 1, 550, 000, sq, mi, an, area, nearly, equal, to, that, of, the, european, union, the, congo, s, discharge, at, its, mouth, ranges, from, 23, 000, to, 75, 000, m, 3, s, 810, 000, to, 2, 650, 000, cu, ft, s, with, an, average, of, 41, 000, m, 3, s, 1, 400, 000, cu, ft, s, the, river, transports, annually, 86, million, tonnes, of, suspended, sediment, to, the, atlantic, ocean, and, an, additional, 6, of, bedload, the, river, and, its, tributaries, flow, through, the, congo, rainforest, the, second, largest, rainforest, area, in, the, world, after, the, amazon, rainforest, in, south, america, the, river, also, has, the, second, largest, flow, in, the, world, behind, the, amazon, the, second, largest, drainage, basin, of, any, river, behind, the, amazon, and, is, one, of, the, deepest, rivers, in, the, world, at, depths, greater, than, 220, m, 720, ft, because, its, drainage, basin, includes, areas, both, north, and, south, of, the, equator, its, flow, is, stable, as, there, is, always, at, least, one, part, of, the, river, experiencing, a, rainy, season, the, sources, of, the, congo, are, in, the, highlands, and, mountains, of, the, east, african, rift, as, well, as, lake, tanganyika, and, lake, mweru, which, feed, the, lualaba, river, which, then, becomes, the, congo, below, boyoma, falls, the, chambeshi, river, in, zambia, is, generally, taken, as, the, source, of, the, congo, in, line, with, the, accepted, practice, worldwide, of, using, the, longest, tributary, as, with, the, nile, river, the, congo, flows, generally, toward, the, northwest, from, kisangani, just, below, the, boyoma, falls, then, gradually, bends, southwestward, passing, by, mbandaka, joining, with, the, ubangi, river, and, running, into, the, pool, malebo, stanley, pool, kinshasa, formerly, l, opoldville, and, brazzaville, are, on, opposite, sides, of, the, river, at, the, pool, where, the, river, narrows, and, falls, through, a, number, of, cataracts, in, deep, canyons, collectively, known, as, the, livingstone, falls, running, by, matadi, and, boma, and, into, the, sea, at, muanda, lower, congo, constitutes, the, lower, parts, of, the, great, river, that, is, the, section, of, the, river, from, the, river, mouth, at, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, twin, capitals, of, brazzaville, and, kinshasa, in, this, section, of, the, river, there, are, two, significant, tributaries, both, on, the, left, or, south, side, the, kwilu, river, originates, in, the, hills, near, the, angolan, border, and, enters, the, congo, some, 100, km, upstream, from, matadi, the, other, is, the, inkisi, river, that, flows, in, a, northerly, direction, from, the, u, ge, province, in, angola, to, the, confluence, with, the, congo, at, zongo, some, 80, km, 50, mi, downstream, from, the, twin, capitals, because, of, the, vast, number, of, rapids, in, particular, the, livingstone, falls, this, section, of, the, river, is, not, operated, continuously, by, riverboats, the, congo, basin, covers, ten, countries, and, accounts, for, about, 13, of, africa, the, highest, point, in, the, congo, basin, is, in, the, ruwenzori, mountains, at, an, altitude, of, around, 4, 340, m, 14, 240, ft, above, sea, level, distribution, of, the, congo, basin, area, between, countries, the, most, important,

and, much, of, the, trade, of, central, africa, passes, along, the, river, including, copper, palm, oil, as, kernels, sugar, coffee, and, cotton, the, congo, river, is, the, most, powerful, river, in, africa, during, the, rainy, season, over, 50, 000, cubic, metres, 1, 800, 000, cu, ft, of, water, per, second, flows, into, the, atlantic, ocean, opportunities, for, the, congo, river, and, its, tributaries, to, generate, hydropower, are, therefore, enormous, scientists, have, calculated, that, the, entire, congo, basin, accounts, for, 13, percent, of, global, hydropower, potential, this, would, provide, sufficient, power, for, all, of, sub, saharan, africa, s, electricity, needs, currently, there, are, about, 40, hydropower, plants, in, the, congo, basin, the, largest, are, the, inga, dams, about, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, southwest, of, kinshasa, the, project, was, launched, in, the, early, 1970s, when, the, first, dam, was, completed, the, plan, as, originally, conceived, called, for, the, construction, of, five, dams, that, would, have, had, a, total, generating, capacity, of, 34, 500, megawatts, mw, to, date, only, the, inga, i, and, inga, ii, dams, have, been, built, generating, 1, 776, mw, in, february, 2005, south, africa, s, state, owned, power, company, eskom, announced, a, proposal, to, expand, generation, through, improvements, and, the, construction, of, a, new, hydroelectric, dam, the, project, would, bring, the, maximum, output, of, the, facility, to, 40, 000, megawatts, mw, it, is, feared, that, these, new, hydroelectric, dams, could, lead, to, the, extinction, of, many, of, the, fish, species, that, are, native, to, the, river, the, current, course, of, the, congo, river, formed, between, 1, 5, and, 2, million, years, bp, during, the, pleistocene, it, is, likely, that, during, this, period, many, upper, tributaries, of, the, congo, were, captured, from, adjacent, river, basins, including, the, uele, and, upper, ubangi, from, the, chari, system, and, the, chambeshi, river, alongside, a, number, of, upper, kasai, river, tributaries, from, the, zambezi, system, the, congo, s, formation, may, have, led, to, the, allopatric, speciation, of, the, bonobo, and, the, common, chimpanzee, from, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, the, bonobo, is, endemic, to, the, humid, forests, in, the, region, as, are, other, iconic, species, like, the, allen, s, swamp, monkey, dryas, monkey, aquatic, genet, okapi, and, congo, peafowl, in, terms, of, aquatic, life, the, congo, river, basin, has, a, very, high, species, richness, and, among, the, highest, known, densities, of, endemics, as, of, 2009, almost, 800, fish, species, have, been, recorded, from, the, congo, river, basin, not, counting, lake, tanganyika, which, is, connected, but, ecologically, very, different, and, large, sections, remain, virtually, unstudied, for, example, the, section, in, salonga, national, park, which, is, about, the, size, of, belgium, had, still, not, been, sampled, at, all, in, 2006, new, fish, species, are, scientifically, described, with, some, regularity, from, the, congo, river, basin, and, many, undescribed, species, are, known, the, congo, has, by, far, the, highest, diversity, of, any, african, river, system, in, comparison, the, next, richest, are, the, niger, volta, and, nile, with, about, 240, 140, and, 130, fish, species, respectively, because, of, the, great, ecological, differences, between, the, regions, in, the, congo, basin, including, habitats, such, as, river, rapids, deep, rivers, swamps, and, lakes, it, is, often, divided, into, multiple, ecoregions, instead, of, treating, it, as, a, single, ecoregion, among, these, ecoregions, the, livingstone, falls, cataracts, has, more, than, 300, fish, species, including, approximately, 80, endemics, while, the, southwestern, part, kasai, river, basin, has, more, than, 200, fish, species, of, which, about, a, quarter, are, endemic, the, dominant, fish, families, at, least, in, parts, of, the, river, are, cyprinidae, carp, cyprinids, such, as, labeo, simpsoni, mormyridae, elephant, fishes, alestidae, african, tetras, mochokidae, squeaker, catfishes, and, cichlidae, cichlids, among, the, natives, in, the, river, is, the, huge, highly, carnivorous, giant, tigerfish, three, of, the, more, unusual, endemics, are, the, whitish, non, pigmented, and, blind, lamprologus, lethops, which, is, believed, to, live, as, deep, as, 160, metres, 520, ft, below, the, surface, heterochromis, multidens, which, is, more, closely, related, to, cichlids, of, the, americas, than, other, african, cichlids, and, caecobarbus, geertsii, the, only, known, cavefish, in, central, africa, there, are, also, numerous, endemic, frogs, and, snails, several, hydroelectric, dams, are, planned, on, the, river, and, these, may, lead, to, the, extinction, of, many, of, the, endemics, several, species, of, turtles, and, the, slender, snouted, nile, and, dwarf, crocodile, are, native, to, the, congo, river, basin, african, manatees, inhabit, the, lower, parts, of, the, river, the, entire, congo, basin, is, populated, by, bantu, peoples, divided, into, several, hundred, ethnic, groups, bantu, expansion, is, estimated, to, have, reached, the, middle, congo, by, about, 500, bc, and, the, upper, congo, by, the, first, century, ad, remnants, of, the, aboriginal, population, displaced, by, the, bantu, migration, pygmies, abatwa, of, the, ubangian, phylum, remain, in, the, remote, forest, areas, of, the, congo, basin, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, formed, in, the, late, 14th, century, from, a, merging, of, the, kingdoms, of, mpemba, kasi, and, mbata, kingdom, on, the, left, banks, of, the, lower, congo, river, its, territorial, control, along, the, river, remained, limited, to, what, corresponds, to, the, modern, kongo, central, province, european, exploration, of, the, congo, began, in, 1482, when, portuguese, explorer, diogo, c, o, discovered, the, river, estuary, likely, in, august, 1482, which, he, marked, by, a, padr, o, or, stone, pillar, still, existing, but, only, in, fragments, erected, on, shark, point, c, o, sailed, up, the, river, for, a, short, distance, establishing, contact, with, the, kingdom, of, kongo, the, full, course, of, the, river, remained, unknown, throughout, the, early, modern, period, the, upper, congo, basin, runs, west, of, the, albertine, rift, its, connection, to, the, congo, was, unknown, until, 1877, the, extreme, northeast, of, the, congo, basin, was, reached, by, the, nilotic, expansion, at, some, point, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, by, the, ancestors, of, the, southern, luo, speaking, alur, people, francisco, de, lacerda, followed, the, zambezi, and, reached, the, uppermost, part, of, the, congo, basin, the, kazembe, in, the, upper, luapula, basin, in, 1796, the, upper, congo, river, was, first, reached, by, the, arab, slave, trade, by, the, 19th, century, nyangwe, was, founded, as, a, slavers, outpost, around, 1860, david, livingstone, was, the, first, european, to, reach, nyangwe, in, march, 1871, livingstone, proposed, to, prove, that, the, lualaba, connected, to, the, nile, but, on, 15, july, he, witnessed, a, massacre, of, about, 400, africans, by, arab, slavers, in, nyangwe, which, experience, left, him, too, horrified, and, shattered, to, continue, his, mission, to, find, the, sources, of, the, nile, so, he, turned, back, to, lake, tanganyika, the, europeans, had, not, reached, the, central, regions, of, the, congo, basin, from, either, the, east, or, west, until, henry, morton, stanley, s, expedition, of, 1876, 77, supported, by, the, committee, for, studies, of, the, upper, congo, at, the, time, one, of, the, last, open, questions, of, the, european, exploration, of, africa, was, whether, the, lualaba, river, fed, the, nile, livingstone, s, theory, the, congo, or, even, the, niger, river, financed, in, 1874, stanley, s, first, trans, africa, exploration, started, in, zanzibar, and, reached, the, lualaba, on, october, 17, 1876, overland, he, reached, nyangwe, the, center, of, a, lawless, area, containing, cannibal, tribes, at, which, tippu, tip, based, his, trade, in, slaves, stanley, managed, to, hire, a, force, from, tippu, tip, to, guard, him, for, the, next, 150, kilometres, 90, mi, or, so, for, 90, days, the, party, left, nyangwe, overland, through, the, dense, matimba, forest, on, november, 19, they, reached, the, lualaba, again, since, the, going, through, the, forest, was, so, heavy, tippu, tip, turned, around, with, his, party, on, december, 28, leaving, stanley, on, his, own, with, 143, people, including, eight, children, and, 16, women, they, had, 23, canoes, his, first, encounter, with, a, local, tribe, was, with, the, cannibal, wenya, in, total, stanley, reports, 32, unfriendly, meetings, on, the, river, some, violent, even, though, he, attempted, to, negotiate, a, peaceful, thoroughfare, but, the, tribes, were, wary, as, their, only, experience, of, outsiders, was, with, slave, traders, on, january, 6, 1877, after, 640, kilometres, 400, mi, they, reached, boyoma, falls, called, stanley, falls, for, some, time, after, consisting, of, seven, cataracts, spanning, 100, kilometres, 60, mi, which, they, had, to, bypass, overland, it, took, them, to, february, 7, to, reach, the, end, of, the, falls, here, stanley, learned, that, the, river, was, called, ikuta, yacongo, proving, to, him, that, he, had, reached, the, congo, and, that, the, lualaba, did, not, feed, the,
