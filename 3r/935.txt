well, as, confrontations, against, the, british, during, the, two, anglo, sikh, wars, after, the, conclusion, of, the, two, anglo, sikh, wars, the, sikh, empire, fell, into, disarray, resulting, in,

estimated, to, have, a, population, of, 120, 000, prior, to, annexation, by, the, british, lahore, s, environs, consisted, mostly, of, the, walled, city, surrounded, by, plains, interrupted, by, settlements, to, the, south, and, east, such, as, mozang, and, qila, gujar, singh, which, have, since, been, engulfed, by, modern, lahore, the, plains, between, the, settlements, also, contained, the, remains, of, mughal, gardens, tombs, and, sikh, era, military, structures, the, british, viewed, lahore, s, walled, city, as, a, bed, of, potential, social, discontent, and, disease, epidemics, and, so, largely, left, the, inner, city, alone, while, focusing, development, efforts, in, lahore, s, suburban, areas, and, punjab, s, fertile, countryside, the, british, instead, laid, out, their, capital, city, in, an, area, south, of, the, walled, city, that, would, first, come, to, be, known, as, donald, s, town, before, being, renamed, civil, station, under, early, british, rule, formerly,

structures, to, house, municipal, offices, such, as, the, civil, secretariat, public, works, department, and, accountant, general, s, office, the, british, built, the, lahore, railway, station, just, outside, the, walled, city, shortly, after, the, sepoy, mutiny, of, 1857, the, station, was, therefore, styled, as, a, medieval, castle, to, ward, off, any, potential, future, uprisings, with, thick, walls, turrets, and, holes, to, direct, gun, and, cannon, fire, for, the, defence, of, the, structure, lahore, s, most, prominent, government, institutions, and, commercial, enterprises, came, to, be, concentrated, in, civil, station, in, a, half, mile, wide, area, flanking, the, mall, where, unlike, in, lahore, s, military, zone, the, british, and, locals, were, allowed, to, mix, the, mall,

was, visited, on, 9, february, 1870, by, prince, alfred, duke, of, edinburgh, a, visit, in, which, he, received, delegations, from, the, dogras, of, jammu, maharajas, of, patiala, the, nawab, of,

model, town, was, established, as, a, garden, town, suburb, in, 1921, while, krishan, nagar, locality, was, laid, in, the, 1930s, near, the, mall, and, walled, city, lahore, played, an, important, role, in, the, independence, movements, of, both, india, and, pakistan, the, declaration, of, the, independence, of, india, was, moved, by, jawaharlal, nehru, and, passed, unanimously, at, midnight, on, 31, december, 1929, at, lahore, s, bradlaugh, hall, the, indian, swaraj, flag, was, adopted, this, time, as, well, lahore, s, jail, was, used, by, the, british, to, imprison, independence,

resolution, in, 1940, demanding, the, creation, of, pakistan, as, a, separate, homeland, for, the, muslims, of, india, the, 1941, census, showed, that, city, of, lahore, had, a, population, of, 671, 659, of, which, was, 64, 5, muslim, with, the, remainder, 35, being, hindu, and, sikh, alongside, a, small, christian, community, the, population, figure, was, disputed, by, hindus, and, sikhs, before, the, boundary, commission, that, would, draw, the, radcliffe, line, to, demarcate, the, border, of, the, two, new, states, based, on, religious, demography, in, a, bid, to, have, lahore, awarded, to, india, they, argued, that, the, city, was, only, 54, muslim, and, that, hindu, and, sikh, domination, of, the, city, s, economy, and, educational, institutions, should, trump, muslim, demography, two, thirds, of, shops, and, 80, of, lahore, s, factories, belonged, to, the, hindu, and, sikh, community, kuldip, nayyar, claimed, that, cyril, radcliffe, had, told, him, in, 1971, that, he, originally, had, planned, to, give, lahore, to, the, new, dominion, of, india, but, decided, to, place, it, within, the, dominion, of, pakistan, which, he, saw, as, lacking, a, major, city, as, he, had, already, awarded, calcutta, to, india, as, tensions, grew, over, the, city, s, uncertain, fate, lahore, experienced, partition, s, worst, riots, carnage, ensued, in, which, all, three, religious, groups, were, both, victims, and, perpetrators, early, riots, in, march, and, april, 1947, destroyed, 6, 000, of, lahore, s, 82, 000, homes, violence, continued, to, rise, throughout, the, summer, despite, the, presence, of, armoured, british, personnel, hindus, and, sikhs, began, to, leave, the, city, en, masse, as, their, hopes, that, the, boundary, commission, would, award, the, city, to, india, came, to, be, regarded, as, increasingly, unlikely, by, late, august, 1947, 66, of, hindus, and, sikhs, had, left, the, city, the, shah, alami, bazaar, once, a, largely, hindu, quarter, of, the, walled, city, was, entirely, burnt, down, during, subsequent, rioting, when, pakistan, s, independence, was, declared, on, 14, august, 1947, the, radcliffe, line, had, not, yet, been, announced, and, so, cries, of, long, live, pakistan, and, god, is, greatest, were, heard, intermittently, with, long, live, hindustan, throughout, the, night, on, 17, august, 1947, lahore, was, awarded, to, pakistan, on, the, basis, of, its, muslim, majority, in, the, 1941, census, and, was, made, capital, of, the, punjab, province, in, the, new, state, of, pakistan, the, city, s, location, near, the, indian, border, meant, that, it, received, large, numbers, of, refugees, fleeing, eastern, punjab, and, northern, india, though, it, was, able, to, accommodate, them, given, the, large, stock, of, abandoned, hindu, and, sikh, properties, that, could, be, re, distributed, to, newly, arrived, refugees, partition, left, lahore, with, a, much, weakened, economy, and, a, stymied, social, and, cultural, scene, that, had, previously, been, invigorated, by, the, city, s, hindus, and, sikhs, industrial, production, dropped, to, one, third, of, pre, partition, level, by, the, end, of, the, 1940s, and, only, 27, of, its, manufacturing, units, were, operating, by, 1950, and, usually, well, below, capacity, capital, flight, further, weakened, the, city, s, economy, while, karachi, industrialized, and, became, more, prosperous, the, city, s, weakened, economy, and, proximity, to, the, indian, border, meant, that, the, city, was, deemed, unsuitable, to, be, the, pakistani, capital, after, independence, karachi, was, therefore, chosen, to, be, the, capital, on, account, of, its, relative, tranquility, during, the, partition, period, stronger, economy, and, better, infrastructure, after, independence, lahore, slowly, regained, its, significance, as, an, economic, and, cultural, centre, of, western, punjab, reconstruction, began, in, 1949, of, the, shah, alami,
