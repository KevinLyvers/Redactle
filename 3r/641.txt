the, arctic, r, t, k, or, r, k, t, k, is, a, polar, region, located, at, the, northernmost, part, of, earth, the, arctic, region, from, the, iers, reference, meridian, travelling, east, consists, of, parts, of, northern, norway, nordland, troms, finnmark, svalbard, and, jan, mayen, northernmost, sweden, v, sterbotten, norrbotten, and, lappland, northern, finland, north, ostrobothnia, kainuu, and, lappi, russia, murmansk, siberia, nenets, okrug, novaya, zemlya, the, united, states, alaska, canada, yukon, northwest, territories, nunavut, danish, realm, greenland, and, northern, iceland, gr, msey, and, kolbeinsey, along, with, the, arctic, ocean, and, adjacent, seas, land, within, the, arctic, region, has, seasonally, varying, snow, and, ice, cover, with, predominantly, treeless, permafrost, under, the, tundra, arctic, seas, contain, seasonal, sea, ice, in, many, places, the, arctic, region, is, a, unique, area, among, earth, s, ecosystems, the, cultures, in, the, region, and, the, arctic, indigenous, peoples, have, adapted, to, its, cold, and, extreme, conditions, life, in, the, arctic, includes, zooplankton, and, phytoplankton, fish, and, marine, mammals, birds, land, animals, plants, and, human, societies, arctic, land, is, bordered, by, the, subarctic, the, word, arctic, comes, from, the, greek, word, arktikos, near, the, bear, northern, and, from, the, word, arktos, meaning, bear, the, name, refers, either, to, the, constellation, known, as, ursa, major, the, great, bear, which, is, prominent, in, the, northern, portion, of, the, celestial, sphere, or, to, the, constellation, ursa, minor, the, little, bear, which, contains, the, celestial, north, pole, currently, very, near, polaris, the, current, north, pole, star, or, north, star, there, are, a, number, of, definitions, of, what, area, is, contained, within, the, arctic, the, area, can, be, defined, as, north, of, the, arctic, circle, about, 66, 34, n, the, approximate, southern, limit, of, the, midnight, sun, and, the, polar, night, another, definition, of, the, arctic, which, is, popular, with, ecologists, is, the, region, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, the, average, temperature, for, the, warmest, month, july, is, below, 10, c, 50, f, the, northernmost, tree, line, roughly, follows, the, isotherm, at, the, boundary, of, this, region, the, climate, of, the, arctic, region, is, characterized, by, cold, winters, and, cool, summers, its, precipitation, mostly, comes, in, the, form, of, snow, and, is, low, with, most, of, the, area, receiving, less, than, 50, cm, 20, in, high, winds, often, stir, up, snow, creating, the, illusion, of, continuous, snowfall, average, winter, temperatures, can, go, as, low, as, 40, c, 40, f, and, the, coldest, recorded, temperature, is, approximately, 68, c, 90, f, coastal, arctic, climates, are, moderated, by, oceanic, influences, having, generally, warmer, temperatures, and, heavier, snowfalls, than, the, colder, and, drier, interior, areas, the, arctic, is, affected, by, current, global, warming, leading, to, climate, change, in, the, arctic, including, arctic, sea, ice, decline, diminished, ice, in, the, greenland, ice, sheet, and, arctic, methane, emissions, as, the, permafrost, thaws, the, melting, of, greenland, s, ice, sheet, is, linked, to, polar, amplification, due, to, the, poleward, migration, of, the, planet, s, isotherms, about, 56, km, 35, mi, per, decade, during, the, past, 30, years, as, a, consequence, of, global, warming, the, arctic, region, as, defined, by, tree, line, and, temperature, is, currently, shrinking, perhaps, the, most, alarming, result, of, this, is, arctic, sea, ice, shrinkage, there, is, a, large, variance, in, predictions, of, arctic, sea, ice, loss, with, models, showing, near, complete, to, complete, loss, in, september, from, 2035, to, some, time, around, 2067, arctic, life, is, characterized, by, adaptation, to, short, growing, seasons, with, long, periods, of, sunlight, and, cold, dark, snow, covered, winter, conditions, arctic, vegetation, is, composed, of, plants, such, as, dwarf, shrubs, graminoids, herbs, lichens, and, mosses, which, all, grow, relatively, close, to, the, ground, forming, tundra, an, example, of, a, dwarf, shrub, is, the, bearberry, as, one, moves, northward, the, amount, of, warmth, available, for, plant, growth, decreases, considerably, in, the, northernmost, areas, plants, are, at, their, metabolic, limits, and, small, differences, in, the, total, amount, of, summer, warmth, make, large, differences, in, the, amount, of, energy, available, for, maintenance, growth, and, reproduction, colder, summer, temperatures, cause, the, size, abundance, productivity, and, variety, of, plants, to, decrease, trees, cannot, grow, in, the, arctic, but, in, its, warmest, parts, shrubs, are, common, and, can, reach, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, height, sedges, mosses, and, lichens, can, form, thick, layers, in, the, coldest, parts, of, the, arctic, much, of, the, ground, is, bare, non, vascular, plants, such, as, lichens, and, mosses, predominate, along, with, a, few, scattered, grasses, and, forbs, like, the, arctic, poppy, herbivores, on, the, tundra, include, the, arctic, hare, lemming, muskox, and, reindeer, caribou, they, are, preyed, on, by, the, snowy, owl, arctic, fox, grizzly, bear, and, arctic, wolf, the, polar, bear, is, also, a, predator, though, it, prefers, to, hunt, for, marine, life, from, the, ice, there, are, also, many, birds, and, marine, species, endemic, to, the, colder, regions, other, terrestrial, animals, include, wolverines, moose, dall, sheep, ermines, and, arctic, ground, squirrels, marine, mammals, include, seals, walruses, and, several, species, of, cetacean, baleen, whales, and, also, narwhals, orcas, and, belugas, an, excellent, and, famous, example, of, a, ring, species, exists, and, has, been, described, around, the, arctic, circle, in, the, form, of, the, larus, gulls, there, are, copious, natural, resources, in, the, arctic, oil, gas, minerals, fresh, water, fish, and, if, the, subarctic, is, included, forest, to, which, modern, technology, and, the, economic, opening, up, of, russia, have, given, significant, new, opportunities, the, interest, of, the, tourism, industry, is, also, on, the, increase, the, arctic, contains, some, of, the, last, and, most, extensive, continuous, wilderness, areas, in, the, world, and, its, significance, in, preserving, biodiversity, and, genotypes, is, considerable, the, increasing, presence, of, humans, fragments, vital, habitats, the, arctic, is, particularly, susceptible, to, the, abrasion, of, groundcover, and, to, the, disturbance, of, the, rare, breeding, grounds, of, the, animals, that, are, characteristic, to, the, region, the, arctic, also, holds, 1, 5, of, the, earth, s, water, supply, during, the, cretaceous, time, period, the, arctic, still, had, seasonal, snows, though, only, a, light, dusting, and, not, enough, to, permanently, hinder, plant, growth, animals, such, as, the, chasmosaurus, hypacrosaurus, troodon, and, edmontosaurus, may, have, all, migrated, north, to, take, advantage, of, the, summer, growing, season, and, migrated, south, to, warmer, climes, when, winter, came, a, similar, situation, may, also, have, been, found, amongst, dinosaurs, that, lived, in, antarctic, regions, such, as, the, muttaburrasaurus, of, australia, however, others, claim, that, dinosaurs, lived, year, round, at, very, high, latitudes, such, as, near, the, colville, river, which, is, now, at, about, 70, n, but, at, the, time, 70, million, years, ago, was, 10, further, north, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, north, america, s, central, and, eastern, arctic, are, referred, to, as, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, ast, and, existed, c, 2500, bce, ast, consisted, of, several, paleo, eskimo, cultures, including, the, independence, cultures, and, pre, dorset, culture, the, dorset, culture, inuktitut, tuniit, or, tunit, refers, to, the, next, inhabitants, of, central, and, eastern, arctic, the, dorset, culture, evolved, because, of, technological, and, economic, changes, during, the, period, of, 1050, 550, bce, with, the, exception, of, the, quebec, labrador, peninsula, the, dorset, culture, vanished, around, 1500, ce, supported, by, genetic, testing, evidence, shows, that, descendants, of, the, dorset, culture, known, as, the, sadlermiut, survived, in, aivilik, southampton, and, coats, islands, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, dorset, thule, culture, transition, dates, around, the, ninth, 10th, centuries, ce, scientists, theorize, that, there, may, have, been, cross, contact, of, the, two, cultures, with, sharing, of, technology, such, as, fashioning, harpoon, heads, or, the, thule, may, have, found, dorset, remnants, and, adapted, their, ways, with, the, predecessor, culture, the, evidence, suggested, that, inuit, descend, from, the, birnirk, of, siberia, who, through, the, thule, culture, expanded, into, northern, canada, and, greenland, where, they, genetically, and, culturally, completely, replaced, the, indigenous, dorset, people, some, time, after, 1300, ce, the, question, of, why, the, dorset, disappeared, so, completely, has, led, some, to, suggest, that, thule, invaders, wiped, out, the, dorset, people, in, an, example, of, prehistoric, genocide, by, 1300, ce, the, inuit, present, day, arctic, inhabitants, and, descendants, of, thule, culture, had, settled, in, west, greenland, and, moved, into, east, greenland, over, the, following, century, inughuit, kalaallit, and, tunumiit, are, modern, greenlandic, inuit, groups, descended, from, thule, over, time, the, inuit, have, migrated, throughout, the, arctic, regions, of, eastern, russia, the, united, states, canada, and, greenland, other, circumpolar, north, indigenous, peoples, include, the, chukchi, evenks, i, upiat, khanty, koryaks, nenets, s, mi, yukaghir, gwich, in, and, yupik, the, eight, arctic, nations, canada, kingdom, of, denmark, finland, iceland, norway, sweden, russia, and, us, are, all, members, of, the, arctic, council, as, are, organizations, representing, six, indigenous, populations, the, aleut, international, association, arctic, athabaskan, council, gwich, in, council, international, inuit, circumpolar, council, russian, association, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, north, and, saami, council, the, council, operates, on, consensus, basis, mostly, dealing, with, environmental, treaties, and, not, addressing, boundary, or, resource, disputes, though, arctic, policy, priorities, differ, every, arctic, nation, is, concerned, about, sovereignty, defense, resource, development, shipping, routes, and, environmental, protection, much, work, remains, on, regulatory, agreements, regarding, shipping, tourism, and, resource, development, in, arctic, waters, arctic, shipping, is, subject, to, some, regulatory, control, through, the, international, code, for, ships, operating, in, polar, waters, adopted, by, the, international, maritime, organization, on, 1, january, 2017, and, applies, to, all, ships, in, arctic, waters, over, 500, tonnes, research, in, the, arctic, has, long, been, a, collaborative, international, effort, evidenced, by, the, international, polar, year, the, international, arctic, science, committee, hundreds, of, scientists, and, specialists, of, the, arctic, council, and, the, barents, euro, arctic, council, are, more, examples, of, collaborative, international, arctic, research, while, there, are, several, ongoing, territorial, claims, in, the, arctic, no, country, owns, the, geographic, north, pole, or, the, region, of, the, arctic, ocean, surrounding, it, the, surrounding, six, arctic, states, that, border, the, arctic, ocean, canada, kingdom, of, denmark, with, greenland, iceland, norway, russia, and, the, united, states, are, limited, to, a, 200, nautical, miles, 370, km, 230, mi, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, off, their, coasts, two, arctic, states, finland, and, sweden, do, not, have, direct, access, to, the, arctic, ocean, upon, ratification, of, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, a, country, has, ten, years, to, make, claims, to, an, extended, continental, shelf, beyond, its, 200, nautical, mile, zone, due, to, this, norway, which, ratified, the, convention, in, 1996, russia, ratified, in, 1997, canada, ratified, in, 2003, and, the, kingdom, of, denmark, ratified, in, 2004, launched, projects, to, establish, claims, that, certain, sectors, of, the, arctic, seabed, should, belong, to, their, territories, on, 2, august, 2007, two, russian, bathyscaphes, mir, 1, and, mir, 2, for, the, first, time, in, history, descended, to, the, arctic, seabed, beneath, the, north, pole, and, placed, there, a, russian, flag, made, of, rust, proof, titanium, alloy, the, flag, placing, during, arktika, 2007, generated, commentary, on, and, concern, for, a, race, for, control, of, the, arctic, s, vast, hydrocarbon, resources, foreign, ministers, and, other, officials, representing, canada, the, kingdom, of, denmark, norway, russia, and, the, united, states, met, in, ilulissat, greenland, on, 28, may, 2008, at, the, arctic, ocean, conference, and, announced, the, ilulissat, declaration, blocking, any, new, comprehensive, international, legal, regime, to, govern, the, arctic, ocean, and, pledging, the, orderly, settlement, of, any, possible, overlapping, claims, as, of, 2012, the, kingdom, of, denmark, is, claiming, the, continental, shelf, based, on, the, lomonosov, ridge, between, greenland, and, over, the, north, pole, to, the, northern, limit, of, the, exclusive, economic, zone, of, russia, the, russian, federation, is, also, claiming, a, large, swath, of, seabed, along, the, lomonosov, ridge, but, unlike, denmark, confined, its, claim, to, its, side, of, the, arctic, region, in, august, 2015, russia, made, a, supplementary, submission, for, the, expansion, of, the, external, borders, of, its, continental, shelf, in, the, arctic, ocean, asserting, that, the, eastern, part, of, the, lomonosov, ridge, and, the, mendeleyev, ridge, are, an, extension, of, the, eurasian, continent, in, august, 2016, the, un, commission, on, the, limits, of, the, continental, shelf, began, to, consider, russia, s, submission, canada, claims, the, northwest, passage, as, part, of, its, internal, waters, belonging, to, canada, while, the, united, states, and, most, maritime, nations, regards, it, as, an, international, strait, which, means, that, foreign, vessels, have, right, of, transit, passage, since, 1937, the, larger, portion, of, the, asian, side, arctic, region, has, been, extensively, explored, by, soviet, and, russian, crewed, drifting, ice, stations, between, 1937, and, 1991, eighty, eight, international, polar, crews, established, and, occupied, scientific, settlements, on, the, drift, ice, and, were, carried, thousands, of, kilometres, by, the, ice, flow, the, arctic, is, comparatively, clean, although, there, are, certain, ecologically, difficult, localized, pollution, problems, that, present, a, serious, threat, to, people, s, health, living, around, these, pollution, sources, due, to, the, prevailing, worldwide, sea, and, air, currents, the, arctic, area, is, the, fallout, region, for, long, range, transport, pollutants, and, in, some, places, the, concentrations, exceed, the, levels, of, densely, populated, urban, areas, an, example, of, this, is, the, phenomenon, of, arctic, haze, which, is, commonly, blamed, on, long, range, pollutants, another, example, is, with, the, bioaccumulation, of, pcb, s, polychlorinated, biphenyls, in, arctic, wildlife, and, people, there, have, been, many, proposals, to, preserve, the, arctic, over, the, years, most, recently, a, group, of, stars, at, the, united, nations, conference, on, sustainable, development, on, 21, june, 2012, proposed, protecting, the, arctic, similar, to, the, antarctic, treaty, system, the, initial, focus, of, the, campaign, will, be, a, un, resolution, creating, a, global, sanctuary, around, the, pole, and, a, ban, on, oil, drilling, and, unsustainable, fishing, in, the, arctic, the, arctic, has, climate, change, rates, that, are, amongst, the, highest, in, the, world, due, to, the, major, impacts, to, the, region, from, climate, change, the, near, climate, future, of, the, region, will, be, extremely, different, under, all, scenarios, of, warming, the, effects, of, climate, change, in, the, arctic, include, rising, temperatures, loss, of, sea, ice, and, melting, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, potential, methane, release, from, the, region, especially, through, the, thawing, of, permafrost, and, methane, clathrates, is, also, a, concern, because, of, the, amplified, response, of, the, arctic, to, global, warming, it, is, often, seen, as, a, leading, indicator, of, global, warming, the, melting, of, greenland, s, ice, sheet, is, linked, to, polar, amplification, the, arctic, region, is, especially, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, any, climate, change, as, has, become, apparent, with, the, reduction, of, sea, ice, in, recent, years, climate, models, predict, much, greater, climate, change, in, the, arctic, than, the, global, average, resulting, in, significant, international, attention, to, the, region, in, particular, there, are, concerns, that, arctic, shrinkage, a, consequence, of, melting, glaciers, and, other, ice, in, greenland, could, soon, contribute, to, a, substantial, rise, in, sea, levels, worldwide, the, current, arctic, warming, is, leading, to, ancient, carbon, being, released, from, thawing, permafrost, leading, to, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, production, by, micro, organisms, release, of, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, stored, in, permafrost, could, cause, abrupt, and, severe, global, warming, as, they, are, potent, greenhouse, gases, climate, change, is, also, predicted, to, have, a, large, impact, on, tundra, vegetation, causing, an, increase, of, shrubs, and, having, a, negative, impact, on, bryophytes, and, lichens, apart, from, concerns, regarding, the, detrimental, effects, of, warming, in, the, arctic, some, potential, opportunities, have, gained, attention, the, melting, of, the, ice, is, making, the, northwest, passage, shipping, routes, through, the, northernmost, latitudes, more, navigable, raising, the, possibility, that, the, arctic, region, will, become, a, prime, trade, route, one, harbinger, of, the, opening, navigability, of, the, arctic, took, place, in, the, summer, of, 2016, when, the, crystal, serenity, successfully, navigated, the, northwest, passage, a, first, for, a, large, cruise, ship, in, addition, it, is, believed, that, the, arctic, seabed, may, contain, substantial, oil, fields, which, may, become, accessible, if, the, ice, covering, them, melts, these, factors, have, led, to, recent, international, debates, as, to, which, nations, can, claim, sovereignty, or, ownership, over, the, waters, of, the, arctic
