river, that, runs, entirely, in, brazilian, territory, and, the, fourth, longest, in, south, america, and, overall, in, brazil, after, the, amazon, the, paran, and, the, madeira, it, used, to, be, known, as, the, opara, by, the, indigenous, people, before, colonisation, and, is, today, also, known, as, velho, chico, the, s, o, francisco, originates, in, the, canastra, mountain, range, in, the, central, western, part, of, the, state, of, minas, gerais, it, runs, generally, north, in, the, states, of, minas, gerais, and, bahia, behind, the, coastal, range, draining, an, area, of, over, 630, 000, square, kilometres, 240, 000, sq, mi, before, turning, east, to, form, the, border, between, bahia, on, the, right, bank, and, the, states, of, pernambuco, and, alagoas, on, the, left, one, after, that, it, ends, on, the, boundaries, between, the, states, of, alagoas, and, sergipe, and, washes, into, the, atlantic, ocean, in, addition, to, the, five, states, which, the, s, o, francisco, directly, traverses, or, borders, its, drainage, basin, also, includes, tributaries, from, the, state, of, goi, s, and, the, federal, district, it, is, an, important, river, for, brazil, called, the, river, of, national, integration, because, it, unites, diverse, climates, and, regions, of, the, country, in, particular, the, southeast, with, the, northeast, it, is, also, significant, because, it, passes, through, the, semi, arid, region, of, the, country, a, region, historically, characterized, by, droughts, and, low, access, to, water, it, is, navigable, between, the, cities, of, pirapora, minas, gerais, and, juazeiro, bahia, as, well, as, between, piranhas, alagoas, and, the, mouth, on, the, ocean, but, traditional, passenger, navigation, has, almost, disappeared, in, recent, years, due, to, changes, in, the, river, flow, see, below, the, river, is, named, for, saint, francis, of, assisi, from, its, first, discovery, by, europeans, on, his, feast, day, 4, october, in, 1501, the, nickname, velho, chico, may, be, translated, as, old, frank, velho, means, old, and, chico, is, a, diminutive, of, francisco, itself, the, portuguese, form, of, the, name, francis, indigenous, peoples, called, it, kalesh, in, the, now, extinct, tux, language, and, op, ra, in, the, extinct, nat, language, tux, truk, nat, kariri, languages, eastern, maxakal, an, languages, j, languages, and, various, unclassified, extinct, languages, were, spoken, in, the, s, o, francisco, river, basin, the, italian, explorer, amerigo, vespucci, first, saw, the, river, on, 4, october, 1501, in, 1865, the, british, explorer, and, diplomat, richard, francis, burton, was, transferred, to, santos, in, brazil, he, explored, the, central, highlands, canoeing, down, the, s, o, francisco, river, from, its, source, to, the, falls, of, paulo, afonso, the, course, of, the, river, running, through, five, states, may, be, divided, into, four, sections, as, follows, the, river, obtains, water, from, 168, rivers, and, streams, of, which, 90, are, on, the, right, bank, and, 78, on, the, left, bank, the, main, tributaries, are, the, s, o, francisco, is, naturally, navigable, all, through, the, year, between, pirapora, minas, gerais, and, the, twin, cities, of, petrolina, pernambuco, and, juazeiro, bahia, a, length, of, 1, 371, kilometres, 852, mi, however, there, are, large, variations, in, depth, depending, on, the, rainfall, because, of, the, diversity, of, physical, characteristics, over, the, course, of, the, navigable, stretch, it, may, be, divided, into, three, substretches, as, follows, until, recent, years, the, s, o, francisco, was, regularly, navigated, by, a, type, of, passenger, boat, called, gaiola, portuguese, for, cage, these, were, paddle, wheel, steamboats, some, of, them, having, been, mississippi, riverboats, and, dating, from, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, after, the, sobradinho, dam, was, built, in, bahia, the, conditions, of, navigability, were, altered, considerably, since, the, reservoir, s, large, size, allowed, for, the, formation, of, short, waves, of, considerable, height, although, the, dam, has, a, navigation, lock, the, waves, and, currents, made, traversing, the, lake, difficult, for, the, gaiolas, at, the, same, time, deforestation, and, excessive, agricultural, use, of, the, upper, course, waters, of, the, s, o, francisco, and, its, tributaries, greatly, reduced, the, water, flow, in, the, middle, course, creating, sand, banks, and, islands, that, hindered, navigation, in, a, short, time, conditions, were, such, that, navigation, became, impossible, for, the, large, gaiolas, although, still, possible, for, smaller, boats, the, shells, of, those, old, riverboats, can, still, be, seen, on, the, river, at, pirapora, as, of, 2009, a, single, boat, the, benjamim, guimar, es, remains, in, activity, making, short, distance, tourist, cruises, from, pirapora, to, s, o, rom, o, and, back, more, than, 200, fish, species, are, known, from, the, s, o, francisco, river, basin, and, it, is, expected, that, several, additional, species, will, be, discovered, in, the, future, especially, from, the, relatively, poorly, known, upper, parts, of, the, river, about, 10, of, the, fish, species, known, from, the, river, basin, are, threatened, and, about, 13, are, important, in, fisheries, about, 64, of, the, fish, species, known, from, the, basin, are, endemic, including, conorhynchos, conirostris, a, catfish, of, uncertain, taxonomic, affinities, lophiosilurus, alexandri, a, flattened, catfish, franciscodoras, marmoratus, an, armoured, catfish, pygocentrus, piraya, the, largest, species, of, piranha, orthospinus, franciscensis, a, characin, and, the, only, member, of, its, genus, hasemania, nana, a, small, tetra, that, often, is, kept, in, aquariums, and, salminus, franciscanus, a, relative, of, the, golden, dorado, more, than, 40, annual, killifish, species, are, found, in, the, s, o, francisco, river, basin, especially, from, the, genera, cynolebias, and, hypsolebias, dams, preventing, fish, migrations, on, the, river, and, pollution, do, present, a, problem, to, the, species, in, the, river, and, fish, mass, deaths, have, been, recorded, the, area, crossed, by, the, river, is, vast, and, sparsely, populated, but, several, towns, lie, on, the, river, beginning, in, minas, gerais, the, river, passes, by, pirapora, s, o, francisco, janu, ria, bom, jesus, da, lapa, the, twin, cities, of, petrolina, and, juazeiro, and, paulo, afonso, the, hinterland, is, arid, and, underpopulated, so, most, of, the, towns, are, small, and, isolated, only, petrolina, and, juazeiro, have, grown, into, medium, sized, cities, and, have, become, prosperous, because, of, fruit, production, based, on, irrigation, the, river, s, hydroelectric, potential, started, being, harnessed, in, 1955, when, the, paulo, afonso, dam, was, built, between, bahia, and, alagoas, the, paulo, afonso, plant, now, provides, electric, power, for, the, whole, of, northeastern, brazil, four, other, large, hydroelectric, plants, were, later, built, tr, s, marias, in, minas, gerais, built, in, 1961, sobradinho, in, bahia, built, in, 1977, luiz, gonzaga, itaparica, between, bahia, and, pernambuco, in, 1988, and, the, xing, near, piranhas, in, 1994, the, sobradinho, reservoir, is, one, of, the, largest, artificial, lakes, in, the, world, with, an, area, of, 4, 214, square, kilometres, 1, 627, sq, mi, the, section, of, dramatic, canyons, between, the, paulo, afonso, and, xing, dams, including, part, of, the, xing, reservoir, is, protected, by, the, 26, 736, hectares, 66, 070, acres, rio, s, o, francisco, natural, monument, the, s, o, francisco, has, great, importance, in, history, and, particularly, in, folklore, that, history, is, celebrated, in, song, legend, and, souvenirs, based, on, the, carrancas, a, kind, of, gargoyle, placed, on, the, prow, of, the, gaiola, boats, and, intended, to, scare, away, river, demons, from, the, boat, tourist, shops, far, from, the, river, have, modernized, replicas, and, miniatures, of, the, vanishing, originals, the, stories, of, river, demons, and, monsters, persist, today, from, paulo, afonso, to, the, historic, town, of, penedo, alagoas, the, river, lies, at, the, bottom, of, a, gorge, or, steep, sided, valley,

emerging, as, a, tourist, attraction, in, 2005, the, brazilian, government, proposed, a, controversial, water, diversion, project, that, will, bring, water, from, the, river, to, semiarid, areas, of, four, brazilian, states, cear, pernambuco, para, ba, and, rio, grande, do, norte, environmentalists, argue, that, the, project, will, do, more, harm, than, good, benefitting, only, large, landowners, and, a, very, small, population, while, bringing, considerable, ecological, impact, the, government, insists, that, the, project, will, give, the, people, in, the, four, states, a, much, needed, water, supply, the, diversion, project, intake, point, is, located, at, cabrob
