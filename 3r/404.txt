the, gobi, desert, mongolian, o, b, i, chinese, pinyin, g, b, is, a, large, cold, desert, and, grassland, region, in, northern, china, and, southern, mongolia, and, is, the, sixth, largest, desert, in, the, world, the, name, of, the, desert, comes, from, the, mongolian, word, gobi, used, to, refer, to, all, of, the, waterless, regions, in, the, mongolian, plateau, while, in, chinese, gobi, is, used, to, refer, to, rocky, semi, deserts, such, as, the, gobi, itself, rather, than, sandy, deserts, the, gobi, measures, 1, 600, km, 1, 000, mi, from, southwest, to, northeast, and, 800, km, 500, mi, from, north, to, south, the, desert, is, widest, in, the, west, along, the, line, joining, the, lake, bosten, and, the, lop, nor, 87, 89, east, its, area, is, approximately, 1, 295, 000, square, kilometres, 500, 000, sq, mi, gobi, includes, the, long, stretch, of, desert, extending, from, the, foot, of, the, pamirs, 77, east, to, the, greater, khingan, mountains, 116, 118, east, on, the, border, of, manchuria, and, from, the, foothills, of, the, altay, sayan, and, yablonoi, mountain, ranges, on, the, north, to, the, kunlun, altyn, tagh, and, qilian, mountain, ranges, which, form, the, northern, edges, of, the, tibetan, plateau, on, the, south, a, relatively, large, area, on, the, east, side, of, the, greater, khingan, range, between, the, upper, waters, of, the, songhua, sungari, and, the, upper, waters, of, the, liao, ho, is, reckoned, to, belong, to, the, gobi, by, conventional, usage, some, geographers, and, ecologists, prefer, to, regard, the, western, area, of, the, gobi, region, as, defined, above, the, basin, of, the, tarim, in, xinjiang, and, the, desert, basin, of, lop, nor, and, hami, kumul, as, forming, a, separate, and, independent, desert, called, the, taklamakan, desert, much, of, the, gobi, is, not, sandy, instead, resembling, exposed, bare, rock, the, gobi, is, overall, a, cold, desert, with, frost, and, occasionally, snow, occurring, on, its, dunes, besides, being, quite, far, north, it, is, also, located, on, a, plateau, roughly, 910, 1, 520, m, 2, 990, 4, 990, ft, above, sea, level, which, contributes, to, its, low, temperatures, an, average, of, about, 194, mm, 7, 6, in, of, rain, falls, annually, in, the, gobi, additional, moisture, reaches, parts, of, the, gobi, in, winter, as, snow, is, blown, by, the, wind, from, the, siberian, steppes, these, winds, may, cause, the, gobi, to, reach, 40, c, 40, f, in, winter, to, 45, c, 113, f, in, summer, however, the, climate, of, the, gobi, is, one, of, great, extremes, with, rapid, changes, of, temperature, of, as, much, as, 35, c, 63, f, in, 24, hour, spans, in, southern, mongolia, the, temperature, has, been, recorded, as, low, as, 32, 8, c, 27, 0, f, in, contrast, in, alxa, inner, mongolia, it, rises, as, high, as, 37, c, 99, f, in, july, average, winter, minimums, are, a, frigid, 21, c, 6, f, while, summertime, maximums, are, a, warm, 27, c, 81, f, most, of, the, precipitation, falls, during, the, summer, although, the, southeast, monsoons, reach, the, southeast, parts, of, the, gobi, the, area, throughout, this, region, is, generally, characterized, by, extreme, dryness, especially, during, the, winter, when, the, siberian, anticyclone, is, at, its, strongest, the, southern, and, central, parts, of, the, gobi, desert, have, variable, plant, growth, due, to, this, monsoon, activity, the, more, northern, areas, of, the, gobi, are, very, cold, and, dry, making, it, unable, to, support, much, plant, growth, this, cold, and, dry, weather, is, attributed, to, siberian, mongolian, high, pressure, cells, hence, the, icy, dust, and, snowstorms, of, spring, and, early, summer, plus, early, january, winter, the, gobi, desert, is, the, source, of, many, important, fossil, finds, including, the, first, dinosaur, eggs, twenty, six, of, which, averaging, 23, centimetres, 9, in, in, length, were, uncovered, in, 1923, archeologists, and, paleontologists, have, done, excavations, in, the, nemegt, basin, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, gobi, desert, in, mongolia, which, is, noted, for, its, fossil, treasures, including, early, mammals, dinosaur, eggs, and, prehistoric, stone, implements, some, 100, 000, years, old, despite, the, harsh, conditions, these, deserts, and, the, surrounding, regions, sustain, many, animals, species, some, are, even, unique, including, black, tailed, gazelles, marbled, polecats, wild, bactrian, camels, mongolian, wild, ass, and, sandplovers, they, are, occasionally, visited, by, snow, leopards, gobi, bears, and, wolves, lizards, are, especially, well, adapted, to, the, climate, of, the, gobi, desert, with, approximately, 30, species, distributed, across, its, southern, mongolian, border, the, most, common, vegetation, in, the, gobi, desert, are, shrubs, adapted, to, drought, these, shrubs, included, gray, sparrow, s, saltwort, salsola, passerina, gray, sagebrush, and, low, grasses, such, as, needle, grass, and, bridlegrass, due, to, livestock, grazing, the, amount, of, shrubs, in, the, desert, has, decreased, several, large, nature, reserves, have, been, established, in, the, gobi, including, gobi, gurvansaikhan, national, park, great, gobi, a, and, great, gobi, b, strictly, protected, area, the, area, is, vulnerable, to, trampling, by, livestock, and, off, road, vehicles, effects, from, human, intervention, are, greater, in, the, eastern, gobi, desert, where, rainfall, is, heavier, and, may, sustain, livestock, in, mongolia, grasslands, have, been, degraded, by, goats, which, are, raised, by, nomadic, herders, as, source, of, cashmere, wool, large, copper, deposits, are, being, mined, by, rio, tinto, group, the, mine, was, and, remains, controversial, there, was, significant, opposition, in, mongolia, s, parliament, to, the, terms, under, which, the, mine, will, proceed, and, some, are, calling, for, the, terms, to, be, renegotiated, specifically, the, contention, revolves, primarily, around, the, question, of, whether, negotiations, were, fair, rio, tinto, is, far, better, resourced, and, whether, rio, tinto, will, pay, adequate, taxes, on, the, revenues, it, derives, from, the, mine, an, agreement, was, reached, whereby, the, operation, will, be, exempt, from, windfall, tax, the, gobi, desert, is, expanding, through, desertification, most, rapidly, on, the, southern, edge, into, china, which, is, seeing, 3, 600, km, 2, 1, 390, sq, mi, of, grassland, overtaken, every, year, dust, storms, increased, in, frequency, between, 1996, and, 2016, causing, further, damage, to, china, s, agriculture, economy, however, in, some, areas, desertification, has, been, slowed, or, reversed, the, northern, and, eastern, boundaries, between, desert, and, grassland, are, constantly, changing, this, is, mostly, due, to, the, climate, conditions, before, the, growing, season, which, influence, the, rate, of, evapotranspiration, and, subsequent, plant, growth, the, expansion, of, the, gobi, is, attributed, mostly, to, human, activities, locally, driven, by, deforestation, overgrazing, and, depletion, of, water, resources, as, well, as, to, climate, change, china, has, tried, various, plans, to, slow, the, expansion, of, the, desert, which, have, met, with, some, success, the, three, north, shelter, forest, program, or, green, great, wall, is, a, chinese, government, tree, planting, project, begun, in, 1978, and, set, to, continue, through, 2050, the, goal, of, the, program, is, to, reverse, desertification, by, planting, aspen, and, other, fast, growing, trees, on, some, 36, 5, million, hectares, across, some, 551, counties, in, 12, provinces, of, northern, china, the, gobi, broadly, defined, can, be, divided, into, five, distinct, dry, ecoregions, based, on, variations, in, climate, and, topography, the, surface, is, extremely, diversified, although, there, are, no, great, differences, in, vertical, elevation, between, ulaanbaatar, 48, 00, n, 107, 00, e, 48, 000, n, 107, 000, e, 48, 000, 107, 000, and, the, small, lake, of, iren, dubasu, nor, 43, 45, n, 111, 50, e, 43, 750, n, 111, 833,

altitudes, of, 1000, 1100, m, and, the, former, at, 1, 070, to, 1, 200, m, 3, 510, to, 3, 940, ft, the, slopes, of, the, plateaus, are, more, or, less, steep, and, are, sometimes, penetrated, by, bays, of, the, lowlands, as, the, border, range, of, the, hyangan, is, approached, the, country, steadily, rises, up, to, 1, 370, m, 4, 490, ft, and, then, to, 1, 630, m, 5, 350, ft, here, small, lakes, frequently, fill, the, depressions, though, the, water, in, them, is, generally, salty, or, brackish, both, here, and, for, 320, km, 199, mi, south, of, ulaanbaatar, streams, are, frequent, and, grass, grows, more, or, less, abundantly, through, all, the, central, parts, until, the, bordering, mountains, are, reached, trees, and, shrubs, are, utterly, absent, clay, and, sand, are, the,

strewn, surface, and, lastly, the, salt, lakes, which, occupy, its, lowest, parts, for, hundreds, of, kilometers, nothing, can, be, seen, but, bare, sands, in, some, places, they, continue, so, far, without, a, break, that, the, mongols, call, them, tengger, i, e, sky, these, vast, expanses, are, absolutely, waterless, nor, do, any, oases, relieve, the, unbroken, stretches, of, yellow, sand, which, alternate, with, equally, vast, areas, of, saline, clay, or, nearer, the, foot, of, the, mountains, with, barren, shingle, although, on, the, whole, a, level, country, with, a, general, altitude, of, 1, 000, to, 1, 500, m, 3, 300, to, 4, 900, ft, this, section, like, most, other, parts, of, the, gobi, is, crowned, by, a, network, of, hills, and, broken, ranges, of, at, least, 300, m, in, elevation, the, vegetation, is, confined, to, a, few, varieties, of, bushes, and, a, dozen, kinds, of, grasses, and, herbs, the, most, conspicuous, being, saxaul, haloxylon, ammondendron, and, agriophyllum, gobicum, the, others, include, prickly, convolvulus, field, wormwood, artemisia, campestris, acacia, inula, ammophila, sophora, flavescens, convolvulus, ammanii, peganum, and,

rivers, formed, from, the, snow, and, glaciers, of, the, high, mountains, break, through, barren, foothill, ranges, and, flow, out, into, an, immense, hollow, plain, here, the, rivers, begin, to, straggle, and, fan, out, and, form, great, marshes, with, dense, reed, beds, westerners, call, this, terrain, the, dzungarian, desert, the, chinese, also, call, it, a, desert, but, the, mongols, call, it, a, gobi, that, is, a, land, of, thin, herbage, more, suitable, for, camels, than, for, cows, but, capable, also, if, herds, are, kept, small, and, moved, frequently, of, sustaining, horses, sheep, and, goats, the, herbage, comprises, a, high, proportion, of, woody, fragrant, plants, gobi, mutton, is, the, most, aromatic, in, the, world, the, yulduz, valley, or, valley, of, the, haidag, gol, 43, n, 83, e, 43, n, 83, e, 43, 83, 43, n, 86, e, 43, n, 86, e, 43, 86, is, a, mini, desert, enclosed, by, two, prominent, members, of, the, shanashen, trahen, osh, mountain, range, namely, the, chucis, and, the, kracenard, pine, rallies, running, perpendicular, and, far, from, one, another, as, they, proceed, south, they, transcend, and, transpose, sweeping, back, on, east, and, west, respectively, with, lake, bosten, in, between, these, two, ranges, mark, the, northern, and, the, southern, edges, respectively, of, a, great, swelling, which, extends, eastward, for, nearly, twenty, degrees, of, longitude, on, its, northern, side, the, chol, tagh, descends, steeply, and, its, foot, is, fringed, by, a, string, of, deep, depressions, ranging, from, lukchun, 130, m, 427, ft, below, sea, level, to, hami, 850, m, 2, 789, ft, above, sea, level, to, the, south, of, the, kuruk, tagh, lie, the, desert, of, lop, nur, the, kum, tagh, desert, and, the, valley, of, the, bulunzir, gol, to, this, great, swelling, which, arches, up, between, the, two, border, ranges, of, the, chol, tagh, and, kuruk, tagh, the, mongols, give, the, name, of, ghashuun, gobi, or, salt, desert, it, is, some, 130, to, 160, km, 81, to, 99, mi, across, from, north, to, south, and, is, traversed, by, a, number, of, minor, parallel, ranges, ridges, and, chains, of, hills, down, its, middle, runs, a, broad, stony, valley, 40, to, 80, km, 25, to, 50, mi, wide, at, an, elevation, of, 900, to, 1, 370, m, 2, 950, to, 4, 490, ft, the, chol, tagh, which, reaches, an, average, altitude, of, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, is, absolutely, sterile, and, its, northern, foot, rests, upon, a, narrow, belt, of, barren, sand, which, leads, down, to, the, depressions, mentioned, above, the, kuruk, tagh, is, the, greatly, disintegrated, denuded, and, wasted, relic, of, a, mountain, range, which, used, to, be, of, incomparably, greater, magnitude, in, the, west, between, lake, bosten, and, the, tarim, it, consists, of, two, possibly, of, three, principal, ranges, which, although, broken, in, continuity, run, generally, parallel, to, one, another, and, embrace, between, them, numerous, minor, chains, of, heights, these, minor, ranges, together, with, the, principal, ranges, divide, the, region, into, a, series, of, long, narrow, valleys, mostly, parallel, to, one, another, and, to, the, enclosing, mountain, chains, which, descend, like, terraced, steps, on, the, one, side, towards, the, depression, of, lukchun, and, on, the, other, towards, the, desert, of, lop, in, many, cases, these, latitudinal, valleys, are, barred, transversely, by, ridges, or, spurs, generally, elevations, en, masse, of, the, bottom, of, the, valley, where, such, elevations, exist, there, is, generally, found, on, the, east, side, of, the, transverse, ridge, a, cauldron, shaped, depression, which, some, time, or, other, has, been, the, bottom, of, a, former, lake, but, is, now, nearly, a, dry, salt, basin, the, surface, configuration, is, in, fact, markedly, similar, to, that, which, occurs, in, the, inter, mount, latitudinal, valleys, of, the, kunlun, mountains, the, hydrography, of, the, ghashiun, gobi, and, the, kuruk, tagh, is, determined, by, the, aforementioned, arrangements, of, the, latitudinal, valleys, most, of, the, principal, streams, instead, of, flowing, straight, down, these, valleys, cross, them, diagonally, and, only, turn, west, after, they, have, cut, their, way, through, one, or, more, of, the, transverse, barrier, ranges, to, the, highest, range, on, the, great, swelling, grigory, grum, grshimailo, gives, the, name, of, tuge, tau, its, altitude, being, 2, 700, m, 8, 858, ft, above, the, level, of, the, sea, and, some, 1, 200, m, 3, 937, ft, above, the, crown, of, the, swelling, itself, this, range, he, considers, to, belong, to, the, choltagh, system, whereas, sven, hedin, would, assign, it, to, the, kuruk, tagh, this, last, which, is, pretty, certainly, identical, with, the, range, of, kharateken, ula, also, known, as, the, kyzyl, sanghir, sinir, and, singher, mountains, that, overlooks, the, southern, shore, of, the, lake, bosten, though, parted, from, it, by, the, drift, sand, desert, of, ak, bel, kum, white, pass, sands, has, at, first, a, west, northwest, to, east, southeast, strike, but, it, gradually, curves, round, like, a, scimitar, towards, the, east, northeast, and, at, the, same, time, gradually, decreases, in, elevation, at, 91, east, where, the, principal, range, of, the, kuruk, tagh, system, wheels, to, the, east, northeast, four, of, its, subsidiary, ranges, terminate, or, rather, die, away, somewhat, suddenly, on, the, brink, of, a, long, narrow, depression, in, which, sven, hedin, sees, a, northeast, bay, of, the, former, great, central, asian, lake, of, lop, nor, having, over, against, them, the, cheloned, terminals, of, similar, subordinate, ranges, of, the, pe, shan, boy, san, system, see, below, the, kuruk, tagh, is, throughout, a, relatively, low, but, almost, completely, barren, range, being, entirely, destitute, of, animal, life, save, for, hares, antelopes, and, wild, camels, which, frequent, its, few, small, widely, scattered, oases, the, vegetation, which, is, confined, to, these, same, areas, is, of, the, scantiest, and, is, mainly, confined, to, bushes, of, saxaul, haloxylon, anabasis, reeds, kamish, tamarisks, poplars, and, ephedra, there, is, little, information, about, early, habitation, of, the, gobi, desert, lisa, janz, has, proposed, a, system, of, nomenclature, for, early, gobi, desert, habitation, they, are, oasis, i, oasis, ii, oasis, iii, oasis, i, is, equivalent, to, the, mesolithic, from, 13500, cal, bp, to, 8000, cal, bp, during, this, time, people, began, using, oases, it, is, characterized, by, oasis, ii, is, equivalent, to, the, neolithic, from, 8000, cal, bp, to, 5000, cal, bp, people, used, the, oases, extensively, it, was, characterized, by, starting, around, 8000, cal, bp, there, was, a, warm, wet, phase, in, the, gobi, desert, by, 7500, cal, bp, lake, levels, in, the, western, gobi, reached, their, peak, around, this, time, there, was, meadow, steppe, vegetation, around, lakes, in, ulaan, nuur, there, may, have, been, shrubby, riparian, woodlands, oasis, iii, is, equivalent, to, the, bronze, age, from, 5000, cal, bp, to, 3000, cal, bp, it, is, characterized, by, bronze, age, herder, burials, have, been, found, in, the, gobi, desert, as, well, as, karasuk, bronze, knives, and, mongolian, deer, stones, between, 5000, cal, bp, and, 4500, cal, bp, there, was, a, period, of, desertification, due, to, the, increasing, aridity, between, 3500, cal, bp, and, 3000, cal, bp, there, was, a, decline, in, human, habitation, in, the, gobi, desert, prehistoric, petroglyphs, have, been, found, in, southern, mongolia, in, 1997, the, gobi, had, a, long, history, of, human, habitation, mostly, by, nomadic, peoples, the, name, of, gobi, means, desert, in, mongolian, the, region, was, inhabited, mostly, by, mongols, uyghurs, and, kazakhs, the, gobi, desert, as, a, whole, was, known, only, very, imperfectly, to, outsiders, as, information, was, confined, to, observations, by, individual, travelers, engaging, in, their, respective, itineraries, across, the, desert, among, the, european, and, american, explorers, who, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, the, gobi, the, most, important, were, the, following
