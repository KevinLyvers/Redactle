assyrian, city, of, nineveh, once, the, largest, city, in, the, world, on, its, east, side, mosul, is, considered, among, the, larger, and, more, historically, and, culturally, significant, cities,

mosul, is, today, anabasis, iii, iv, 10, it, may, be, safer, to, identify, xenophon, s, m, psila, with, the, site, of, iski, mosul, or, old, mosul, about, 30, km, 19, mi, north, of, modern, mosul, where, six, centuries, after, xenophon, s, report, the, sasanian, empire, s, center, of, budh, ardhashir, was, built, in, any, case, mepsila, is, doubtless, the, root, of, the, current, name, in, its,

25th, century, bc, after, the, akkadian, empire, 2335, 2154, bc, which, united, all, the, peoples, of, mesopotamia, under, one, rule, mosul, again, became, a, continuous, part, of, assyria, proper, from, circa, 2050, bc, through, the, fall, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, between, 612, and, 599, bc, mosul, remained, within, the, geopolitical, province, of, assyria, for, another, 13, centuries, as, a, part, of, achaemenid, assyria, seleucid, roman, assyria, and, sasanian, as, rist, n, until, the, early, muslim, conquests, of, the, mid, 7th, century, after, the, muslim, conquests, the,

was, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, significant, cities, in, antiquity, and, was, settled, as, early, as, 6000, bc, the, city, is, mentioned, in, the, old, assyrian, empire, 2025, 1750, bc, and, during, the, reign, of, shamshi, adad, i, 1809, 1776, bc, it, was, listed, as, a, center, of, worship, of, the, goddess, ishtar, remaining, so, during, the, middle, assyrian, empire, 1365, 1056, bc, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, nineveh, grew, in, size, and, importance, particularly, from, the, reigns, of, tukulti, ninurta, ii, and, ashurnasirpal, ii, 883, 859, bc, onward, he, chose, the, city, of, kalhu, the, biblical, calah, modern, nimrud, as, his, capital, in, place, of, the, ancient, traditional, capital, of, a, ur, ashur, 30, km, 19, mi, from, present, day, mosul, thereafter, successive, assyrian, emperor, monarchs, such, as, shalmaneser, iii, adad, nirari, iii, tiglath, pileser, iii, shalmaneser, v, and, sargon, ii, continued, to, expand, the, city, around, 700, bc, king, sennacherib, made, nineveh, assyria, s, new, capital, immense, building, work, was, undertaken, and, nineveh, eclipsed, babylon, kalhu, and, a, ur, in, size, and, importance, making, it, the, largest, city, in, the, world, many, scholars, believe, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, were, at, nineveh, the, mound, of, kuyunjik, in, mosul, is, the, site, of, the, palaces, of, king,

uballit, ii, fought, his, way, out, of, nineveh, and, formed, a, new, assyrian, capital, at, harran, now, in, southeastern, turkey, mosul, then, the, assyrian, town, of, mepsila, founded, by, the, former, inhabitants, out, of, the, ruins, of, their, former, capital, later, succeeded, nineveh, as, the, tigris, bridgehead, of, the, road, that, linked, assyria, and, anatolia, with, the, short, lived, median, empire, and, succeeding, achaemenid, empire, 546, 332, bc, where, it, was, a, part, of, the, geopolitical, province, of, athura, assyria, where, the, region, and, assyria, in, general, saw, a, significant, economic, revival, mosul, became, part, of, the, seleucid, empire, after, alexander, s, conquests, in, 332, bc, while, little, is, known, of, the, city, from, the, hellenistic, period, mosul, likely, belonged, to, the, seleucid, satrapy, of, syria, the, greek, term, for, assyria, syria, originally, meaning, assyria, rather, than, the, modern, nation, of, syria, which, the, parthian, empire, conquered, circa, 150, bc, mosul, changed, hands, again, with, the, rise, of, the, sasanian, empire, in, 225, and, became, a, part, of, the, sasanian, province, of, as, rist, n, christianity, was, present, among, the, indigenous, assyrian, people, in, mosul, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, although, the, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, remained, strong, until, the, 4th, century, it, became, an, episcopal, seat, of, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, in, the, 6th, century, in, 637, other, sources, say, 641, during, the, period, of, the, caliph, umar, mosul, was, annexed, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, by, utba, ibn, farqad, al, sulami, during, the, early, arab, muslim, invasions, and, conquests, after, which, assyria, dissolved, as, a, geopolitical, entity, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, turkic, dynasts, ishaq, ibn, kundaj, and, his, son, muhammad, seized, control, over, mosul, but, in, 893, mosul, came, once, again, under, the, direct, control, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, the, early, 10th, century, mosul, came, under, the, control, of, the, native, arab, hamdanid, dynasty, from, mosul, the, hamdanids, under, abdallah, ibn, hamdan, and, his, son, nasir, al, dawla, expanded, their, control, over, upper, mesopotamia, for, several, decades, first, as, governors, of, the, abbassids, and, later, as, de, facto, independent, rulers, a, century, later, they, were, supplanted, by, the, uqaylid, dynasty, mosul, was, conquered, by, the, seljuk, empire, in, the, 11th, century, after, a, period, under, semi, independent, atabeg, such, as, mawdud, in, 1127, it, became, the, centre, of, power, of, the, zengid, dynasty, saladin, besieged, the, city, of, mosul, unsuccessfully, in, 1182, after, his, conquest, of, aleppo, in, 1183, ending, zengid, rule, in, syria, saladin, made, a, last, offensive, against, mosul, in, late, 1185, hoping, for, an, easy, victory, over, the, presumably, demoralized, zengid, emir, of, mosul, mas, ud, but, failed, due, to, the, city, s, unexpectedly, stiff, resistance, and, a, serious, illness, which, caused, saladin, to, withdraw, to, harran, upon, abbasid, encouragement, saladin, and, mas, ud, negotiated, a, treaty, in, march, 1186, that, left, the, zengids, in, control, of, mosul, but, under, the, obligation, to, supply, the, ayyubids, with, military, support, when, requested, the, city, remained, in, control, of, the, zengids, until, badr, al, din, lu, lu, took, over, from, 1234, to, 1259, during, the, final, stages, of, the, mongol, invasion, of, persia, and, mesopotamia, in, 1258, while, about, 80, years, old, badr, al, din, lu, lu, went, in, person, to, meraga, to, offer, his, submission, to, the, mongol, invader, hulagu, badr, al, din, helped, the, khan, in, his, following, campaigns, in, syria, mosul, was, spared, destruction, but, badr, al, din, died, shortly, thereafter, in, 1259, badr, al, din, s, son, continued, in, his, father, s, steps, but, after, the, mongol, defeat, in, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, 1260, against, the, mamluks, he, sided, with, the, latter, and, revolted, against, the, mongols, hulagu, then, besieged, the, city, of, mosul, for, nine, month, and, destroyed, it, in, 1262, later, mosul, regained, some, importance, but, never, recovered, its, original, splendor, mosul, was, thenceforth, ruled, by, the, mongol, ilkhanate, and, jalairid, sultanate, and, escaped, timur, s, destructions, in, 1165, benjamin, of, tudela, passed, through, mosul, he, wrote, about, a, jewish, community, of, about, 7, 000, people, led, by, rabbi, zakkai, presumed, to, be, a, scion, of, the, davidic, line, in, 1288, 89, when, the, exilarch, was, in, mosul, he, signed, a, supporting, paper, for, maimonides, in, the, early, 16th, century, mosul, was, under, the, turkmen, federation, of, the, a, qoyunlu, but, in, 1508, it, was, conquered, by, the, safavid, dynasty, of, iran, in, the, 13th, century, mosul, had, a, flourishing, industry, making, luxury, brass, items, that, were, ornately, inlaid, with, silver, 283, 6, many, of, these, items, survive, today, in, fact, of, all, medieval, islamic, artifacts, mosul, brasswork, has, the, most, epigraphic, inscriptions, 12, however, the, only, reference, to, this, industry, in, contemporary, sources, is, the, account, of, ibn, sa, id, an, andalusian, geographer, who, traveled, through, the, region, around, 1250, 283, 4, he, wrote, that, there, are, many, crafts, in, the, city, especially, inlaid, brass, vessels, which, are, exported, and, presented, to, rulers, 284, these, were, expensive, items, that, only, the, wealthiest, could, afford, and, it, wasn, t, until, the, early, 1200s, that, mosul, had, the, demand, for, large, scale, production, of, them, 285, mosul, was, then, a, wealthy, prosperous, capital, city, first, for, the, zengids, and, then, for, badr, al, din, lu, lu, 285, the, origins, of, mosul, s, inlaid, brasswork, industry, are, uncertain, 52, the, city, had, an, iron, industry, in, the, late, 10th, century, when, al, muqaddasi, recorded, that, it, exported, iron, and, iron, goods, like, buckets, knives, and, chains, 52, however, no, surviving, metal, objects, from, mosul, are, known, before, the, early, 13th, century, 52, inlaid, metalworking, in, the, islamic, world, was, first, developed, in, khurasan, in, the, 12th, century, by, silversmiths, facing, a, shortage, of, silver, 52, 3, by, the, mid, 12th, century, herat, in, particular, had, gained, a, reputation, for, its, high, quality, inlaid, metalwork, 53, the, practice, of, inlaying, required, relatively, few, tools, and, the, technique, spread, westward, perhaps, by, khurasani, artisans, moving, to, other, cities, 53, by, the, turn, of, the, 13th, century, the, silver, inlaid, brass, technique, had, reached, mosul, 53, a, pair, of, engraved, brass, flabella, found, in, egypt, and, possibly, made, in, mosul, are, dated, by, a, syriac, inscription, to, the, year, 1202, which, would, make, them, the, earliest, known, mosul, brasses, with, a, definite, date, although, they, are, not, inlaid, with, anything, 49, 50, one, extant, item, may, be, even, older, an, inlaid, ewer, by, the, master, craftsman, ibrahim, ibn, mawaliya, is, of, an, unknown, date, but, d, s, rice, estimated, that, it, was, made, around, 1200, 53, production, of, inlaid, brasswork, in, mosul, may, have, already, begun, before, the, turn, of, the, century, 53, 4, the, body, of, mosul, metalwork, significantly, expands, in, the, 1220s, several, signed, and, dated, items, are, known, from, this, decade, which, according, to, julian, raby, probably, reflects, the, craft, s, growing, status, and, production, 54, in, the, two, decades, from, roughly, 1220, to, 1240, the, mosul, brass, industry, saw, rapid, innovations, in, technique, decoration, and, composition, 54, artisans, were, inspired, by, miniature, paintings, produced, in, the, mosul, area, 54, mosul, seems, to, have, become, predominant, among, muslim, centers, of, metalwork, in, the, early, 13th, century, 53, evidence, is, partial, and, indirect, relatively, few, objects, which, directly, state, where, they, were, made, exist, and, in, the, rest, of, cases, it, depends, on, nisbah, s, 53, however, al, mawsili, is, by, far, the, most, common, nisbah, only, two, others, are, attested, al, is, irdi, referring, to, someone, from, siirt, and, al, baghdadi, 53, there, are, however, some, scientific, instruments, inlaid, with, silver, that, were, made, in, syria, during, this, period, with, the, earliest, being, 1222, 3, 619, ah, 53, instability, after, the, death, of, badr, al, din, lu, lu, in, 1259, and, especially, the, mongol, siege, and, capture, of, mosul, in, july, 1262, probably, caused, a, decline, in, mosul, s, metalworking, industry, 54, there, is, a, relative, lack, of, known, metalwork, from, the, jazira, in, the, late, 1200s, meanwhile, an, abundance, of, metalwork, from, mamluk, syria, and, egypt, is, attested, from, this, same, period, 54, this, doesn, t, necessarily, mean, that, production, in, mosul, ended, though, and, some, extant, objects, from, this, period, may, have, been, made, in, mosul, 54, 5, the, earliest, definite, evidence, of, mawsili, craftsmen, emigrating, westward, to, mamluk, syria, and, egypt, dates, from, the, 1250s, 23, 54, extant, mawsili, works, from, these, regions, seem, to, be, the, result, of, one, particular, family, setting, up, workshops, in, damascus, and, then, cairo, rather, than, a, mass, movement, of, mosul, artisans, to, those, cities, 37, five, mawsili, craftsmen, are, known, from, these, two, cities, in, the, late, 13th, century, of, which, 3, or, 4, are, members, of, this, same, family, 37, the, first, is, husayn, ibn, muhammad, al, mawsili, who, produced, the, earliest, known, silver, inlaid, work, from, damascus, in, the, late, 1250s, 39, his, presumed, son, ali, ibn, husayn, ibn, muhammad, al, mawsili, was, active, in, cairo, several, decades, later, 37, 9, however, the, earliest, known, silver, inlaid, brasswork, from, cairo, belongs, to, another, presumed, member, of, this, family, muhammad, ibn, hasan, 37, 9, his, one, known, work, a, candlestick, dated, to, 1269, has, an, inscription, which, suggests, he, died, before, it, was, completed, 39, the, key, figure, for, early, mamluk, metalwork, in, cairo, however, was, ali, ibn, husayn, 39, his, works, from, the, 1280s, both, show, mosul, influence, as, well, as, a, different, early, mamluk, style, 39, a, final, member, was, husayn, ibn, ahmad, ibn, husayn, a, grandson, of, husayn, ibn, muhammad, who, was, active, at, the, turn, of, the, 14th, century, and, made, a, major, work, for, the, rasulid, sultan, al, mu, ayyad, hizabr, al, din, dawud, ibn, yusuf, 42, 4, this, family, appears, to, have, initiated, two, of, the, most, characteristic, features, of, 14th, century, mamluk, metalwork, large, scale, inspirational, candlesticks, and, large, multi, lobed, medallions, with, a, wide, border, that, eventually, became, filled, with, flying, ducks, 42, mosul, metalwork, eventually, influenced, a, tradition, of, metal, inlay, in, fars, and, elsewhere, in, western, iran, in, the, 14th, century, 55, the, ilkhanids, rounding, up, artisans, and, gathering, them, in, their, capital, of, tabriz, for, centralized, royal, production, may, have, played, a, role, in, this, transmission, 55, only, two, items, are, definitively, known, to, have, been, produced, in, mosul, 23, the, first, is, the, blacas, ewer, made, by, shuja, ibn, man, a, in, 1232, and, the, second, is, a, silver, inlaid, pen, box, made, by, ali, ibn, yahya, in, 1255, 6, 653, ah, 12, 23, no, other, works, by, either, craftsman, are, known, 23, they, form, part, of, the, broader, mosul, work, which, consists, of, 35, known, surviving, brasses, made, by, artisans, with, the, nisbah, al, mawsili, by, some, 27, different, makers, 22, 80, of, them, are, from, the, years, 1220, to, 1275, and, the, remaining, 20, are, from, 1275, to, about, 1325, 23, modern, western, scholarship, has, termed, this, body, of, metalwork, attributed, to, mosul, the, mosul, school, although, the, validity, of, this, grouping, is, disputed, 283, the, indiscriminate, attribution, of, silver, inlaid, brasses, to, mosul, 283, particularly, by, gaston, migeon, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, led, to, a, reaction, against, the, term, 13, later, scholars, such, as, max, van, berchem, mehmet, a, a, o, lu, and, d, s, rice, all, took, a, more, skeptical, view, van, berchem, in, particular, argued, that, only, six, known, items, could, be, definitely, attributed, to, mosul, and, others, were, likely, made, elsewhere, 13, 5, souren, melikian, chirvani, remarked, in, 1973, that, mosul, had, been, famous, in, the, west, for, a, century, for, metalwork, it, did, not, make, 11, however, julian, raby, has, defended, the, concept, of, the, mosul, school, arguing, that, the, city, did, have, a, distinct, metalworking, tradition, with, its, own, techniques, styles, and, motifs, and, sense, of, community, 11, 2, he, compared, mosul, s, metalwork, to, kashan, s, pottery, and, wrote, that, mawsili, metalworkers, displayed, a, conscious, sense, of, community, and, tradition, and, at, least, in, the, early, years, a, proud, acknowledgement, of, tradition, and, that, the, city, s, metalwork, gained, a, wide, reputation, or, brand, value, lasting, for, over, a, century, 57, part, of, raby, s, argument, was, that, many, items, shared, one, or, two, recurring, symbols, that, served, no, practical, purpose, and, may, have, been, meant, as, a, brand, workshop, mark, a, guild, emblem, or, perhaps, as, a, mark, of, master, craftsmanship, 12, 31, 33, 56, the, first, one, is, an, octagon, filled, with, complex, geometric, patterns, which, appears, on, at, least, 13, items, over, the, course, of, three, decades, the, 1220s, through, the, 1240s, 30, 2, several, of, the, most, important, mosul, artists, from, what, raby, terms, the, second, generation, of, mosul, metalwork, all, used, this, symbol, ahmad, al, dhaki, ibn, jaldak, shuja, ibn, man, a, dawud, ibn, salama, and, yunus, ibn, yusuf, 32, a, notable, absence, is, ibrahim, ibn, mawaliya, a, member, of, the, first, generation, 32, the, octagon, disappears, after, about, 1250, and, is, also, not, used, by, workers, known, to, have, been, outside, mosul, 32, another, recurring, symbol, is, a, rosette, with, either, 10, or, 12, leaves, found, at, the, bottom, of, the, item, either, the, base, of, a, ewer, or, the, bottom, of, the, shaft, of, a, candlestick, 33, this, is, not, normally, visible, and, perhaps, because, it, served, no, practical, purpose, it, was, eventually, abandoned, around, the, middle, of, the, century, 33, the, last, example, of, this, rosette, is, the, bottom, of, a, candlestick, made, by, dawud, ibn, salama, in, 1248, 9, 646, ah, 33, raby, suggested, that, ibrahim, ibn, mawaliya, may, have, been, a, seminal, figure, in, the, mosul, brasswork, industry, 33, the, particular, phrasing, of, the, benedictory, inscriptions, on, his, objects, bestowing, good, luck, on, their, owners, is, repeated, in, several, works, by, other, mosul, craftsmen, 33, two, assistants, of, ibrahim, ibn, mawaliya, s, are, known, his, tilmidh, apprentice, isma, il, ibn, ward, and, his, ghulam, qasim, ibn, ali, 24, ahmad, al, dhaki, s, workshop, was, possibly, also, intimately, connected, to, others, in, mosul, 35, the, mosul, metalwork, is, the, only, example, in, the, muslim, world, where, metalworkers, recorded, their, relationships, between, masters, and, apprentices, tilmidh, and, hirelings, ajir, 56, this, was, apparently, a, point, of, pride, for, mosul, artisans, 56, julian, raby, speculated, that, two, elaborate, but, impractically, tiny, mosuli, objects, a, tiny, 6x4, cm, box, made, by, isma, il, ibn, ward, and, an, anonymous, 8, cm, tall, bucket, were, made,
