longitude, l, n, d, tj, u, d, au, and, uk, also, l, is, a, geographic, coordinate, that, specifies, the, east, west, position, of, a, point, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, or, another, celestial, body, it, is, an, angular, measurement, usually, expressed, in, degrees, and, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, lambda, meridians, are, imaginary, semicircular, lines, running, from, pole, to, pole, that, connect, points, with, the, same, longitude, the, prime, meridian, defines, 0, longitude, by, convention, the, international, reference, meridian, for, the, earth, passes, near, the, royal, observatory, in, greenwich, south, east, london, on, the, island, of, great, britain, positive, longitudes, are, east, of, the, prime, meridian, and, negative, ones, are, west, because, of, the, earth, s, rotation, there, is, a, close, connection, between, longitude, and, time, measurement, scientifically, precise, local, time, varies, with, longitude, a, difference, of, 15, longitude, corresponds, to, a, one, hour, difference, in, local, time, due, to, the, differing, position, in, relation, to, the, sun, comparing, local, time, to, an, absolute, measure, of, time, allows, longitude, to, be, determined, depending, on, the, era, the, absolute, time, might, be, obtained, from, a, celestial, event, visible, from, both, locations, such, as, a, lunar, eclipse, or, from, a, time, signal, transmitted, by, telegraph, or, radio, the, principle, is, straightforward, but, in, practice, finding, a, reliable, method, of, determining, longitude, took, centuries, and, required, the, effort, of, some, of, the, greatest, scientific, minds, a, location, s, north, south, position, along, a, meridian, is, given, by, its, latitude, which, is, approximately, the, angle, between, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, normal, from, the, ground, at, that, location, longitude, is, generally, given, using, the, geodetic, normal, or, the, gravity, direction, the, astronomical, longitude, can, differ, slightly, from, the, ordinary, longitude, because, of, vertical, deflection, small, variations, in, earth, s, gravitational, field, see, astronomical, latitude, the, concept, of, longitude, was, first, developed, by, ancient, greek, astronomers, hipparchus, 2nd, century, bce, used, a, coordinate, system, that, assumed, a, spherical, earth, and, divided, it, into, 360, as, we, still, do, today, his, prime, meridian, passed, through, alexandria, 31, he, also, proposed, a, method, of, determining, longitude, by, comparing, the, local, time, of, a, lunar, eclipse, at, two, different, places, thus, demonstrating, an, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, longitude, and, time, 11, claudius, ptolemy, 2nd, century, ce, developed, a, mapping, system, using, curved, parallels, that, reduced, distortion, he, also, collected, data, for, many, locations, from, britain, to, the, middle, east, he, used, a, prime, meridian, through, the, canary, islands, so, that, all, longitude, values, would, be, positive, while, ptolemy, s, system, was, sound, the, data, he, used, were, often, poor, leading, to, a, gross, over, estimate, by, about, 70, of, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, 551, 553, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, interest, in, geography, greatly, declined, in, europe, 65, hindu, and, muslim, astronomers, continued, to, develop, these, ideas, adding, many, new, locations, and, often, improving, on, ptolemy, s, data, for, example, al, batt, n, used, simultaneous, observations, of, two, lunar, eclipses, to, determine, the, difference, in, longitude, between, antakya, and, raqqa, with, an, error, of, less, than, 1, this, is, considered, to, be, the, best, that, can, be, achieved, with, the, methods, then, available, observation, of, the, eclipse, with, the, naked, eye, and, determination, of, local, time, using, an, astrolabe, to, measure, the, altitude, of, a, suitable, clock, star, in, the, later, middle, ages, interest, in, geography, revived, in, the, west, as, travel, increased, and, arab, scholarship, began, to, be, known, through, contact, with, spain, and, north, africa, in, the, 12th, century, astronomical, tables, were, prepared, for, a, number, of, european, cities, based, on, the, work, of, al, zarq, l, in, toledo, the, lunar, eclipse, of, september, 12, 1178, was, used, to, establish, the, longitude, differences, between, toledo, marseilles, and, hereford, 85, christopher, columbus, made, two, attempts, to, use, lunar, eclipses, to, discover, his, longitude, the, first, in, saona, island, on, 14, september, 1494, second, voyage, and, the, second, in, jamaica, on, 29, february, 1504, fourth, voyage, it, is, assumed, that, he, used, astronomical, tables, for, reference, his, determinations, of, longitude, showed, large, errors, of, 13, and, 38, w, respectively, randles, 1985, documents, longitude, measurement, by, the, portuguese, and, spanish, between, 1514, and, 1627, both, in, the, americas, and, asia, errors, ranged, from, 2, to, 25, the, telescope, was, invented, in, the, early, 17th, century, initially, an, observation, device, developments, over, the, next, half, century, transformed, it, into, an, accurate, measurement, tool, the, pendulum, clock, was, patented, by, christiaan, huygens, in, 1657, and, gave, an, increase, in, accuracy, of, about, 30, fold, over, previous, mechanical, clocks, these, two, inventions, would, revolutionise, observational, astronomy, and, cartography, on, land, the, period, from, the, development, of, telescopes, and, pendulum, clocks, until, the, mid, 18th, century, saw, a, steady, increase, in, the, number, of, places, whose, longitude, had, been, determined, with, reasonable, accuracy, often, with, errors, of, less, than, a, degree, and, nearly, always, within, 2, to, 3, by, the, 1720s, errors, were, consistently, less, than, 1, at, sea, during, the, same, period, the, situation, was, very, different, two, problems, proved, intractable, the, first, was, the, need, of, a, navigator, for, immediate, results, the, second, was, the, marine, environment, making, accurate, observations, in, an, ocean, swell, is, much, harder, than, on, land, and, pendulum, clocks, do, not, work, well, in, these, conditions, in, response, to, the, problems, of, navigation, a, number, of, european, maritime, powers, offered, prizes, for, a, method, to, determine, longitude, at, sea, the, best, known, of, these, is, the, longitude, act, passed, by, the, british, parliament, in, 1714, 8, it, offered, two, levels, of, rewards, for, solutions, within, 1, and, 0, 5, rewards, were, given, for, two, solutions, lunar, distances, made, practicable, by, the, tables, of, tobias, mayer, developed, into, an, nautical, almanac, by, the, astronomer, royal, nevil, maskelyne, and, for, the, chronometers, developed, by, the, yorkshire, carpenter, and, clock, maker, john, harrison, harrison, built, five, chronometers, over, more, than, three, decades, this, work, was, supported, and, rewarded, with, thousands, of, pounds, from, the, board, of, longitude, but, he, fought, to, receive, money, up, to, the, top, reward, of, 20, 000, finally, receiving, an, additional, payment, in, 1773, after, the, intervention, of, parliament, 26, it, was, some, while, before, either, method, became, widely, used, in, navigation, in, the, early, years, chronometers, were, very, expensive, and, the, calculations, required, for, lunar, distances, were, still, complex, and, time, consuming, lunar, distances, came, into, general, use, after, 1790, chronometers, had, the, advantages, that, both, the, observations, and, the, calculations, were, simpler, and, as, they, became, cheaper, in, the, early, 19th, century, they, started, to, replace, lunars, which, were, seldom, used, after, 1850, the, first, working, telegraphs, were, established, in, britain, by, wheatstone, and, cooke, in, 1839, and, in, the, us, by, morse, in, 1844, it, was, quickly, realised, that, the, telegraph, could, be, used, to, transmit, a, time, signal, for, longitude, determination, the, method, was, soon, in, practical, use, for, longitude, determination, especially, in, north, america, and, over, longer, and, longer, distances, as, the, telegraph, network, expanded, including, western, europe, with, the, completion, of, transatlantic, cables, the, united, states, coast, survey, renamed, the, united, states, coast, and, geodetic, survey, in, 1878, was, particularly, active, in, this, development, and, not, just, in, the, united, states, the, survey, established, chains, of, mapped, locations, through, central, and, south, america, and, the, west, indies, and, as, far, as, japan, and, china, in, the, years, 1874, 90, this, contributed, greatly, to, the, accurate, mapping, of, these, areas, while, mariners, benefited, from, the, accurate, charts, they, could, not, receive, telegraph, signals, while, under, way, and, so, could, not, use, the, method, for, navigation, this, changed, when, wireless, telegraphy, radio, became, available, in, the, early, 20th, century, wireless, time, signals, for, the, use, of, ships, were, transmitted, from, halifax, nova, scotia, starting, in, 1907, and, from, the, eiffel, tower, in, paris, from, 1910, these, signals, allowed, navigators, to, check, and, adjust, their, chronometers, frequently, radio, navigation, systems, came, into, general, use, after, world, war, ii, the, systems, all, depended, on, transmissions, from, fixed, navigational, beacons, a, ship, board, receiver, calculated, the, vessel, s, position, from, these, transmissions, they, allowed, accurate, navigation, when, poor, visibility, prevented, astronomical, observations, and, became, the, established, method, for, commercial, shipping, until, replaced, by, gps, in, the, early, 1990s, the, main, methods, for, determining, longitude, are, listed, below, with, one, exception, magnetic, declination, they, all, depend, on, a, common, principle, which, was, to, determine, an, absolute, time, from, an, event, or, measurement, and, to, compare, the, corresponding, the, local, time, at, two, different, locations, with, the, exception, of, magnetic, declination, all, proved, practicable, methods, developments, on, land, and, sea, however, were, very, different, longitude, at, a, point, may, be, determined, by, calculating, the, time, difference, between, that, at, its, location, and, coordinated, universal, time, utc, since, there, are, 24, hours, in, a, day, and, 360, degrees, in, a, circle, the, sun, moves, across, the, sky, at, a, rate, of, 15, degrees, per, hour, 360, 24, hours, 15, per, hour, so, if, a, location, s, time, zone, is, three, hours, ahead, of, utc, then, that, location, is, near, 45, longitude, 3, hours, 15, per, hour, 45, the, word, near, is, used, because, the, point, might, not, be, at, the, centre, of, the, time, zone, also, the, time, zones, are, defined, politically, so, their, centres, and, boundaries, often, do, not, lie, on, meridians, at, multiples, of, 15, in, order, to, perform, this, calculation, however, one, needs, a, chronometer, watch, set, to, utc, and, needs, to, determine, local, time, by, solar, or, astronomical, observation, the, details, are, more, complex, than, described, here, see, the, articles, on, universal, time, and, on, the, equation, of, time, for, more, details, longitude, is, given, as, an, angular, measurement, with, 0, at, the, prime, meridian, ranging, from, 180, westward, to, 180, eastward, the, greek, letter, lambda, is, used, to, denote, the, location, of, a, place, on, earth, east, or, west, of, the, prime, meridian, each, degree, of, longitude, is, sub, divided, into, 60, minutes, each, of, which, is, divided, into, 60, seconds, a, longitude, is, thus, specified, in, sexagesimal, notation, as, for, example, 23, 27, 30, e, for, higher, precision, the, seconds, are, specified, with, a, decimal, fraction, an, alternative, representation, uses, degrees, and, minutes, and, parts, of, a, minute, are, expressed, in, decimal, notation, thus, 23, 27, 5, e, degrees, may, also, be, expressed, as, a, decimal, fraction, 23, 45833, e, for, calculations, the, angular, measure, may, be, converted, to, radians, so, longitude, may, also, be, expressed, in, this, manner, as, a, signed, fraction, of, pi, or, an, unsigned, fraction, of, 2, for, calculations, the, west, east, suffix, is, replaced, by, a, negative, sign, in, the, western, hemisphere, the, international, standard, convention, iso, 6709, that, east, is, positive, is, consistent, with, a, right, handed, cartesian, coordinate, system, with, the, north, pole, up, a, specific, longitude, may, then, be, combined, with, a, specific, latitude, positive, in, the, northern, hemisphere, to, give, a, precise, position, on, the, earth, s, surface, confusingly, the, convention, of, negative, for, east, is, also, sometimes, seen, most, commonly, in, the, united, states, the, earth, system, research, laboratories, used, it, on, an, older, version, of, one, of, their, pages, in, order, to, make, coordinate, entry, less, awkward, for, applications, confined, to, the, western, hemisphere, they, have, since, shifted, to, the, standard, approach, the, longitude, is, singular, at, the, poles, and, calculations, that, are, sufficiently, accurate, for, other, positions, may, be, inaccurate, at, or, near, the, poles, also, the, discontinuity, at, the, 180, meridian, must, be, handled, with, care, in, calculations, an, example, is, a, calculation, of, east, displacement, by, subtracting, two, longitudes, which, gives, the, wrong, answer, if, the, two, positions, are, on, either, side, of, this, meridian, to, avoid, these, complexities, some, applications, use, another, horizontal, position, representation, the, length, of, a, degree, of, longitude, east, west, distance, depends, only, on, the, radius, of, a, circle, of, latitude, for, a, sphere, of, radius, a, that, radius, at, latitude, is, a, cos, and, the, length, of, a, one, degree, or, 180, radian, arc, along, a, circle, of, latitude, is, when, the, earth, is, modelled, by, an, ellipsoid, this, arc, length, becomes, where, e, the, eccentricity, of, the, ellipsoid, is, related, to, the, major, and, minor, axes, the, equatorial, and, polar, radii, respectively, by, an, alternative, formula, is, cos, decreases, from, 1, at, the, equator, to, 0, at, the, poles, which, measures, how, circles, of, latitude, shrink, from, the, equator, to, a, point, at, the, pole, so, the, length, of, a, degree, of, longitude, decreases, likewise, this, contrasts, with, the, small, 1, increase, in, the, length, of, a, degree, of, latitude, north, south, distance, equator, to, pole, the, table, shows, both, for, the, wgs84, ellipsoid, with, a, 6, 378, 137, 0, m, and, b, 6, 356, 752, 3142, m, the, distance, between, two, points, 1, degree, apart, on, the, same, circle, of, latitude, measured, along, that, circle, of, latitude, is, slightly, more, than, the, shortest, geodesic, distance, between, those, points, unless, on, the, equator, where, these, are, equal, the, difference, is, less, than, 0, 6, m, 2, ft, a, geographical, mile, is, defined, to, be, the, length, of, one, minute, of, arc, along, the, equator, one, equatorial, minute, of, longitude, therefore, a, degree, of, longitude, along, the, equator, is, exactly, 60, geographical, miles, or, 111, 3, kilometers, as, there, are, 60, minutes, in, a, degree, the, length, of, 1, minute, of, longitude, along, the, equator, is, 1, geographical, mile, or, 1, 855, km, or, 1, 153, miles, while, the, length, of, 1, second, of, it, is, 0, 016, geographical, mile, or, 30, 916, m, or, 101, 43, feet
