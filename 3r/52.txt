the, sargasso, sea, s, r, s, o, is, a, region, of, the, atlantic, ocean, bounded, by, four, currents, forming, an, ocean, gyre, unlike, all, other, regions, called, seas, it, has, no, land, boundaries, it, is, distinguished, from, other, parts, of, the, atlantic, ocean, by, its, characteristic, brown, sargassum, seaweed, and, often, calm, blue, water, the, sea, is, bounded, on, the, west, by, the, gulf, stream, on, the, north, by, the, north, atlantic, current, on, the, east, by, the, canary, current, and, on, the, south, by, the, north, atlantic, equatorial, current, the, four, together, forming, a, clockwise, circulating, system, of, ocean, currents, termed, the, north, atlantic, gyre, it, lies, between, 20, and, 35, north, and, 40, and, 70, west, and, is, approximately, 1, 100, kilometres, 600, nautical, miles, wide, by, 3, 200, km, 1, 750, nmi, long, bermuda, is, near, the, western, fringes, of, the, sea, while, all, of, the, above, currents, deposit, marine, plants, and, refuse, into, the, sea, ocean, water, in, the, sargasso, sea, is, distinctive, for, its, deep, blue, color, and, exceptional, clarity, with, underwater, visibility, of, up, to, 60, m, 200, ft, it, is, also, a, body, of, water, that, has, captured, the, public, imagination, and, so, is, seen, in, a, wide, variety, of, literary, and, artistic, works, and, in, popular, culture, a, chart, drawn, by, the, catalan, cartographer, gabriel, de, vallseca, of, mallorca, has, been, interpreted, to, indicate, that, the, azores, were, first, discovered, by, diogo, de, silves, in, 1427, in, 1431, gon, alo, velho, was, dispatched, with, orders, to, determine, the, location, of, islands, first, identified, by, de, silves, velho, apparently, got, as, far, as, the, formigas, in, the, eastern, archipelago, before, having, to, return, to, sagres, probably, due, to, bad, weather, by, this, time, the, portuguese, navigators, had, also, reached, the, sargasso, sea, western, north, atlantic, region, naming, it, after, the, sargassum, seaweed, growing, there, sarga, o, sargasso, in, portuguese, later, in, 1492, christopher, columbus, wrote, about, seaweed, that, he, feared, would, trap, his, ship, and, potentially, hide, shallow, waters, that, could, run, them, aground, as, well, as, a, lack, of, wind, that, he, feared, would, trap, them, the, sea, may, have, been, known, to, earlier, mariners, as, a, poem, by, the, late, fourth, century, author, avienius, describes, a, portion, of, the, atlantic, as, being, covered, with, seaweed, and, windless, citing, a, now, lost, account, by, the, fifth, century, bce, carthaginian, himilco, the, navigator, columbus, himself, was, aware, of, this, account, and, thought, himilco, had, reached, the, sargasso, sea, as, did, several, other, explorers, however, modern, scholars, consider, this, unlikely, in, 1609, the, english, vessel, sea, venture, was, blown, to, the, shore, of, bermuda, the, sea, has, also, been, the, site, of, whaling, and, fishing, the, 1920, 1922, dana, expeditions, led, by, johannes, schmidt, determined, that, the, european, eel, s, breeding, sites, were, in, the, sargasso, sea, the, sea, has, played, a, role, in, a, number, of, other, pioneering, research, efforts, including, william, beebe, and, otis, barton, s, 1932, dive, where, they, conducted, observations, of, animals, and, radio, broadcasts, john, swallow, s, work, on, the, swallow, float, in, the, late, 1950s, the, discovery, of, prochlorococcus, by, a, team, of, researchers, in, the, 1980s, and, various, oceanographic, data, gathering, programs, such, as, those, of, henry, stommel, in, july, 1969, british, businessman, and, amateur, sailor, donald, crowhurst, disappeared, after, his, yacht, became, mired, in, the, sargasso, sea, he, had, been, competing, in, the, sunday, times, golden, globe, race, a, single, handed, round, the, world, yacht, race, when, his, poorly, prepared, boat, began, to, take, on, water, he, abandoned, his, circumnavigation, attempt, but, reported, false, positions, by, radio, in, an, attempt, to, give, the, impression, that, he, was, still, participating, eventually, crowhurst, wound, up, drifting, in, the, sargasso, sea, where, he, deteriorated, psychologically, filling, his, logbooks, with, metaphysical, speculation, and, delusional, comments, his, last, entry, was, july, 1, and, his, yacht, was, found, unoccupied, and, drifting, on, july, 10, it, is, unclear, whether, his, death, came, as, the, result, of, suicide, or, misadventure, the, sea, is, bounded, on, the, west, by, the, gulf, stream, on, the, north, by, the, north, atlantic, current, on, the, east, by, the, canary, current, and, on, the, south, by, the, north, atlantic, equatorial, current, the, four, together, forming, a, clockwise, circulating, system, of, ocean, currents, termed, the, north, atlantic, gyre, it, lies, between, 20, to, 35, n, and, 40, and, 70, w, and, is, approximately, 1, 100, km, 600, nmi, wide, by, 3, 200, km, 1, 750, nmi, long, bermuda, is, near, the, western, fringes, of, the, sea, because, the, sargasso, sea, is, bordered, by, oceanic, currents, its, precise, borders, may, change, the, canary, current, in, particular, is, widely, variable, and, often, the, line, utilized, is, one, west, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, a, 2011, report, based, the, sea, s, boundaries, on, several, variables, including, currents, presence, of, seaweed, and, the, topography, of, the, ocean, floor, and, determined, that, the, specific, boundaries, of, the, sea, were, between, 22, 38, n, 76, 43, w, and, centred, on, 30, n, and, 60, w, for, a, total, of, around, 4, 163, 499, km, 2, 1, 213, 882, sq, nmi, the, sargasso, sea, is, home, to, seaweed, of, the, genus, sargassum, which, floats, en, masse, on, the, surface, the, great, atlantic, sargassum, belt, is, the, largest, such, mass, in, the, world, the, sargassum, masses, generally, are, not, a, threat, to, shipping, and, historic, incidents, of, sailing, ships, being, trapped, there, are, due, to, the, often, calm, winds, of, the, horse, latitudes, the, sargasso, sea, plays, a, role, in, the, migration, of, catadromous, eel, species, such, as, the, european, eel, the, american, eel, and, the, american, conger, eel, the, larvae, of, these, species, hatch, within, the, sea, and, as, they, grow, they, travel, to, europe, or, the, east, coast, of, north, america, later, in, life, the, matured, eel, migrates, back, to, the, sargasso, sea, to, spawn, and, lay, eggs, it, is, also, believed, that, after, hatching, young, loggerhead, sea, turtles, use, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, to, travel, to, the, sargasso, sea, where, they, use, the, sargassum, as, cover, from, predators, until, they, are, mature, the, sargassum, fish, is, a, species, of, frogfish, specially, adapted, to, blend, in, among, the, sargassum, seaweed, millions, of, european, eel, babies, are, born, there, and, then, make, an, epic, three, year, journey, back, to, uk, waters, many, seabird, species, also, fly, and, feed, across, that, vast, expanse, of, open, golden, sea, on, their, way, to, britain, in, the, early, 2000s, the, sargasso, sea, was, sampled, as, part, of, the, global, ocean, sampling, survey, to, evaluate, its, diversity, of, microbial, life, through, metagenomics, contrary, to, previous, theories, results, indicated, the, area, has, a, wide, variety, of, prokaryotic, life, commonly, called, seaweed, sargassum, is, a, type, of, macroalgae, like, all, algae, it, produces, oxygen, based, on, 1975, measurements, of, oxygen, production, and, estimates, of, the, total, mass, of, sargassum, in, the, sea, it, can, be, calculated, that, the, sargasso, sea, may, produce, 2, 2, billion, litres, of, o, per, hour, this, makes, it, a, very, important, part, of, global, ecology, the, sargasso, sea, like, many, unique, ocean, ecosystems, is, under, various, threats, such, as, industrial, scale, fishing, plastic, waste, pollution, oil, drilling, and, deep, sea, mining, owing, to, surface, currents, the, sargasso, accumulates, a, high, concentration, of, non, biodegradable, plastic, waste, the, area, contains, the, huge, north, atlantic, garbage, patch, several, nations, and, nongovernmental, organizations, have, united, to, protect, the, sargasso, sea, these, organizations, include, the, sargasso, sea, commission, established, 11, march, 2014, by, the, governments, of, the, azores, portugal, bermuda, united, kingdom, monaco, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, bacteria, that, consume, plastic, have, been, found, in, the, plastic, polluted, waters, of, the, sargasso, sea, however, it, is, unknown, whether, these, bacteria, ultimately, clean, up, poisons, or, simply, spread, them, elsewhere, in, the, marine, microbial, ecosystem, plastic, debris, can, absorb, toxic, chemicals, from, ocean, pollution, potentially, poisoning, anything, that, eats, it, human, activity, in, the, sargasso, sea, has, negatively, impacted, it, such, as, over, fishing, and, shipping, the, sargasso, sea, is, often, portrayed, in, literature, and, the, media, as, an, area, of, mystery, it, is, often, depicted, in, fiction, as, a, dangerous, area, where, ships, are, mired, in, weed, for, centuries, unable, to, escape, ezra, pound, s, portrait, d, une, femme,
