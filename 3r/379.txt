uluru, u, l, r, u, pitjantjatjara, ulu, u, also, known, as, ayers, rock, r, z, airs, and, officially, gazetted, as, uluru, ayers, rock, is, a, large, sandstone, monolith, it, outcrops, near, the, centre, of, australia, in, the, southern, part, of, the, northern, territory, 335, km, 208, mi, south, west, of, alice, springs, uluru, is, sacred, to, the, pitjantjatjara, the, aboriginal, people, of, the, area, known, as, the, a, angu, the, area, around, the, formation, is, home, to, an, abundance, of, springs, waterholes, rock, caves, and, ancient, paintings, uluru, is, listed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, uluru, and, kata, tjuta, also, known, as, the, olgas, are, the, two, major, features, of, the, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, uluru, is, one, of, australia, s, most, recognisable, natural, landmarks, and, has, been, a, popular, destination, for, tourists, since, the, late, 1930s, it, is, also, one, of, the, most, important, indigenous, sites, in, australia, the, local, a, angu, the, pitjantjatjara, people, call, the, landmark, ulu, u, pitjantjatjara, this, word, is, a, proper, noun, with, no, further, particular, meaning, in, the, pitjantjatjara, dialect, although, it, is, used, as, a, local, family, name, by, the, senior, traditional, owners, of, uluru, on, 19, july, 1873, the, surveyor, william, gosse, sighted, the, landmark, and, named, it, ayers, rock, in, honour, of, the, then, chief, secretary, of, south, australia, sir, henry, ayers, in, 1993, a, dual, naming, policy, was, adopted, that, allowed, official, names, that, consist, of, both, the, traditional, aboriginal, name, in, the, pitjantjatjara, yankunytjatjara, and, other, local, languages, and, the, english, name, on, 15, december, 1993, it, was, renamed, ayers, rock, uluru, and, became, the, first, official, dual, named, feature, in, the, northern, territory, the, order, of, the, dual, names, was, officially, reversed, to, uluru, ayers, rock, on, 6, november, 2002, following, a, request, from, the, regional, tourism, association, in, alice, springs, the, sandstone, formation, stands, 348, m, 1, 142, ft, high, rising, 863, m, 2, 831, ft, above, sea, level, with, most, of, its, bulk, lying, underground, and, has, a, total, perimeter, of, 9, 4, km, 5, 8, mi, uluru, is, notable, for, appearing, to, change, colour, at, different, times, of, the, day, and, year, most, notably, when, it, glows, red, at, dawn, and, sunset, the, reddish, colour, in, the, rock, derives, from, iron, oxide, in, the, sandstone, kata, tjuta, also, called, mount, olga, or, the, olgas, lies, 25, km, 16, mi, west, of, uluru, special, viewing, areas, with, road, access, and, parking, have, been, constructed, to, give, tourists, the, best, views, of, both, sites, at, dawn, and, dusk, both, uluru, and, the, nearby, kata, tjuta, formation, have, great, cultural, significance, for, the, local, a, angu, people, the, traditional, inhabitants, of, the, area, who, lead, walking, tours, to, inform, visitors, about, the, bush, food, local, flora, and, fauna, and, the, aboriginal, dreamtime, stories, of, the, area, archaeological, findings, to, the, east, and, west, indicate, that, humans, settled, in, the, area, more, than, 10, 000, years, ago, europeans, arrived, in, the, australian, western, desert, in, the, 1870s, uluru, and, kata, tjuta, were, first, mapped, by, europeans, in, 1872, during, the, expeditionary, period, which, was, made, possible, by, the, construction, of, the, australian, overland, telegraph, line, in, separate, expeditions, ernest, giles, and, william, gosse, were, the, first, european, explorers, to, this, area, while, exploring, the, area, in, 1872, giles, sighted, kata, tjuta, from, a, location, near, kings, canyon, and, called, it, mount, olga, while, the, following, year, gosse, observed, uluru, and, named, it, ayers, rock, in, honour, of, the, chief, secretary, of, south, australia, sir, henry, ayers, further, explorations, followed, with, the, aim, of, establishing, the, possibilities, of, the, area, for, pastoralism, in, the, late, 19th, century, pastoralists, attempted, to, establish, themselves, in, areas, adjoining, the, southwestern, petermann, reserve, and, interaction, between, a, angu, and, white, people, became, more, frequent, and, more, violent, due, to, the, effects, of, grazing, and, drought, bush, food, stores, became, depleted, competition, for, these, resources, created, conflict, between, the, two, groups, resulting, in, more, frequent, police, patrols, later, during, the, depression, in, the, 1930s, a, angu, became, involved, in, dingo, scalping, with, doggers, who, introduced, the, a, angu, to, european, foods, and, ways, between, 1918, and, 1921, large, adjoining, areas, of, south, australia, western, australia, and, the, northern, territory, were, declared, as, aboriginal, reserves, government, run, settlements, where, the, aboriginal, people, were, forced, to, live, in, 1920, part, of, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, was, declared, an, aboriginal, reserve, commonly, known, as, the, south, western, or, petermann, reserve, by, the, australian, government, under, the, aboriginals, ordinance, 1918, the, first, tourists, arrived, in, the, uluru, area, in, 1936, permanent, european, settlement, of, the, area, began, in, the, 1940s, under, aboriginal, welfare, policy, and, to, promote, tourism, at, uluru, this, increased, tourism, prompted, the, formation, of, the, first, vehicular, tracks, in, 1948, and, tour, bus, services, began, early, in, the, 1950s, in, 1958, the, area, that, would, become, the, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, was, excised, from, the, petermann, reserve, it, was, placed, under, the, management, of, the, northern, territory, reserves, board, and, named, the, ayers, rock, mount, olga, national, park, the, first, ranger, was, bill, harney, a, well, recognised, central, australian, figure, by, 1959, the, first, motel, leases, had, been, granted, and, eddie, connellan, had, constructed, an, airstrip, close, to, the, northern, side, of, uluru, following, a, 1963, suggestion, from, the, northern, territory, reserves, board, a, chain, was, laid, to, assist, tourists, in, climbing, the, landmark, the, chain, was, removed, in, 2019, on, 26, october, 1985, the, australian, government, returned, ownership, of, uluru, to, the, local, pitjantjatjara, people, with, a, condition, that, the, a, angu, would, lease, it, back, to, the, national, parks, and, wildlife, agency, for, 99, years, and, that, it, would, be, jointly, managed, an, agreement, originally, made, between, the, community, and, prime, minister, bob, hawke, that, the, climb, to, the, top, by, tourists, would, be, stopped, was, later, broken, the, aboriginal, community, of, mutitjulu, with, a, population, of, approximately, 300, is, located, near, the, eastern, end, of, uluru, from, uluru, it, is, 17, km, 11, mi, by, road, to, the, tourist, town, of, yulara, population, 3, 000, which, is, situated, just, outside, the, national, park, on, 8, october, 2009, the, talinguru, nyakuntjaku, viewing, area, opened, to, public, visitation, the, a, 21, million, project, about, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, on, the, east, side, of, uluru, involved, design, and, construction, supervision, by, the, a, angu, traditional, owners, of, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, of, roads, and, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, of, walking, trails, the, development, of, tourism, infrastructure, adjacent, to, the, base, of, uluru, that, began, in, the, 1950s, soon, produced, adverse, environmental, impacts, it, was, decided, in, the, early, 1970s, to, remove, all, accommodation, related, tourist, facilities, and, re, establish, them, outside, the, park, in, 1975, a, reservation, of, 104, km, 2, 40, sq, mi, of, land, beyond, the, park, s, northern, boundary, 15, km, 9, mi, from, uluru, was, approved, for, the, development, of, a, tourist, facility, and, an, associated, airport, to, be, known, as, yulara, in, 1983, the, ayers, rock, campground, opened, followed, by, the, four, seasons, hotel, later, renamed, voyages, desert, gardens, hotel, and, the, sheraton, hotel, voyages, sails, in, the, desert, in, 1984, the, town, square, bank, and, primary, school, were, also, established, after, the, commonwealth, government, handed, the, national, park, back, to, its, traditional, owners, in, 1985, management, of, the, park, was, transferred, from, the, northern, territory, government, to, the, australian, national, parks, and, wildlife, service, the, following, year, in, july, 1992, yulara, development, company, was, dissolved, and, the, ayers, rock, resort, company, was, established, after, which, all, hotels, came, under, the, same, management, since, the, park, was, listed, as, a, world, heritage, site, annual, visitor, numbers, rose, to, over, 400, 000, visitors, by, 2000, increased, tourism, provides, regional, and, national, economic, benefits, it, also, presents, an, ongoing, challenge, to, balance, conservation, of, cultural, values, and, visitor, needs, the, local, a, angu, do, not, climb, uluru, because, of, its, great, spiritual, significance, they, have, in, the, past, requested, that, visitors, not, climb, the, rock, partly, due, to, the, path, crossing, a, sacred, traditional, dreamtime, track, and, also, due, to, a, sense, of, responsibility, for, the, safety, of, visitors, until, october, 2019, the, visitors, guide, said, the, climb, is, not, prohibited, but, we, prefer, that, as, a, guest, on, a, angu, land, you, will, choose, to, respect, our, law, and, culture, by, not, climbing, on, 11, december, 1983, the, prime, minister, of, australia, bob, hawke, promised, to, hand, back, the, land, title, to, the, a, angu, traditional, custodians, and, caretakers, and, agreed, to, the, community, s, 10, point, plan, which, included, forbidding, the, climbing, of, uluru, the, government, set, access, to, climb, uluru, and, a, 99, year, lease, instead, of, the, previously, agreed, upon, 50, year, lease, as, conditions, before, the, title, was, officially, given, back, to, the, a, angu, on, 26, october, 1985, a, chain, handhold, added, to, the, rock, in, 1964, and, extended, in, 1976, made, the, hour, long, climb, easier, but, it, remained, a, steep, 800, m, 0, 5, mi, hike, to, the, top, where, it, can, be, quite, windy, it, was, recommended, that, individuals, drink, plenty, of, water, while, climbing, and, that, those, who, were, unfit, or, who, suffered, from, vertigo, or, medical, conditions, restricting, exercise, did, not, attempt, it, climbing, uluru, was, generally, closed, to, the, public, when, high, winds, were, present, at, the, top, as, of, july, 2018, 37, deaths, related, to, recreational, climbing, have, been, recorded, according, to, a, 2010, publication, just, over, one, third, of, all, visitors, to, the, park, climbed, uluru, a, high, percentage, of, these, were, children, about, one, sixth, of, visitors, made, the, climb, between, 2011, and, 2015, the, traditional, owners, of, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, nguraritja, and, the, federal, government, s, director, of, national, parks, share, decision, making, on, the, management, of, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, under, their, joint, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, management, plan, 2010, 20, issued, by, the, director, of, national, parks, under, the, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, 1999, clause, 6, 3, 3, provides, that, the, director, and, the, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, board, of, management, should, work, to, close, the, climb, upon, meeting, any, of, three, conditions, there, were, adequate, new, visitor, experiences, less, than, 20, per, cent, of, visitors, made, the, climb, or, the, critical, factors, in, decisions, to, visit, were, cultural, and, natural, experiences, despite, cogent, evidence, that, the, second, condition, was, met, by, july, 2013, the, climb, remained, open, several, controversial, incidents, on, top, of, uluru, in, 2010, including, a, striptease, golfing, and, nudity, led, to, renewed, calls, for, banning, the, climb, on, 1, november, 2017, the, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, board, voted, unanimously, to, prohibit, climbing, uluru, as, a, result, there, was, a, surge, in, climbers, and, visitors, after, the, ban, was, announced, the, ban, took, effect, on, the, 26, october, 2019, and, the, chain, was, then, removed, a, november, 2017, nt, news, poll, found, that, 63, of, respondents, did, not, support, the, ban, a, 2019, essential, poll, found, that, only, 44, supported, the, ban, the, a, angu, request, that, visitors, do, not, photograph, certain, sections, of, uluru, for, reasons, related, to, traditional, tjukurpa, dreaming, beliefs, these, areas, are, the, sites, of, gender, linked, rituals, or, ceremonies, and, are, forbidden, ground, for, a, angu, of, the, opposite, sex, to, those, participating, in, the, rituals, in, question, the, photographic, restriction, is, intended, to, prevent, a, angu, from, inadvertently, violating, this, taboo, by, encountering, photographs, of, the, forbidden, sites, in, the, outside, world, in, september, 2020, parks, australia, alerted, google, australia, to, the, user, generated, images, from, the, uluru, summit, that, have, been, posted, on, the, google, maps, platform, and, requested, that, the, content, be, removed, in, accordance, with, the, wishes, of, a, angu, uluru, s, traditional, owners, and, the, national, park, s, film, and, photography, guidelines, google, agreed, to, the, request, during, heavy, rain, waterfalls, cascade, down, the, sides, of, uluru, a, rare, phenomenon, that, only, 1, of, all, tourists, get, to, see, large, rainfall, events, occurred, in, 2016, and, the, summer, of, 2020, 21, uluru, is, an, inselberg, meaning, island, mountain, an, inselberg, is, a, prominent, isolated, residual, knob, or, hill, that, rises, abruptly, from, and, is, surrounded, by, extensive, and, relatively, flat, erosion, lowlands, in, a, hot, dry, region, uluru, is, also, often, referred, to, as, a, monolith, although, this, is, an, ambiguous, term, that, is, generally, avoided, by, geologists, the, remarkable, feature, of, uluru, is, its, homogeneity, and, lack, of, jointing, and, parting, at, bedding, surfaces, leading, to, the, lack, of, development, of, scree, slopes, and, soil, these, characteristics, led, to, its, survival, while, the, surrounding, rocks, were, eroded, for, the, purpose, of, mapping, and, describing, the, geological, history, of, the, area, geologists, refer, to, the, rock, strata, making, up, uluru, as, the, mutitjulu, arkose, and, it, is, one, of, many, sedimentary, formations, filling, the, amadeus, basin, uluru, is, dominantly, composed, of, coarse, grained, arkose, a, type, of, sandstone, characterised, by, an, abundance, of, feldspar, and, some, conglomerate, average, composition, is, 50, feldspar, 25, 35, quartz, and, up, to, 25, rock, fragments, most, feldspar, is, k, feldspar, with, only, minor, plagioclase, as, subrounded, grains, and, highly, altered, inclusions, within, k, feldspar, the, grains, are, typically, 2, 4, mm, 0, 079, 0, 157, in, in, diameter, and, are, angular, to, subangular, the, finer, sandstone, is, well, sorted, with, sorting, decreasing, with, increasing, grain, size, the, rock, fragments, include, subrounded, basalt, invariably, replaced, to, various, degrees, by, chlorite, and, epidote, the, minerals, present, suggest, derivation, from, a, predominantly, granite, source, similar, to, the, musgrave, block, exposed, to, the, south, when, relatively, fresh, the, rock, has, a, grey, colour, but, weathering, of, iron, bearing, minerals, by, the, process, of, oxidation, gives, the, outer, surface, layer, of, rock, a, red, brown, rusty, colour, features, related, to, deposition, of, the, sediment, include, cross, bedding, and, ripples, analysis, of, which, indicated, deposition, from, broad, shallow, high, energy, fluvial, channels, and, sheet, flooding, typical, of, alluvial, fans, the, mutitjulu, arkose, is, about, the, same, age, as, the, conglomerate, at, kata, tjuta, and, has, a, similar, origin, despite, the, different, rock, type, it, is, younger, than, the, rocks, exposed, to, the, east, at, mount, conner, and, unrelated, to, them, the, strata, at, uluru, are, nearly, vertical, dipping, to, the, south, west, at, 85, and, have, an, exposed, thickness, of, at, least, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, the, strata, dip, below, the, surrounding, plain, and, no, doubt, extend, well, beyond, uluru, in, the, subsurface, but, the, extent, is, not, known, the, rock, was, originally, sand, deposited, as, part, of, an, extensive, alluvial, fan, that, extended, out, from, the, ancestors, of, the, musgrave, mann, and, petermann, ranges, to, the, south, and, west, but, separate, from, a, nearby, fan, that, deposited, the, sand, pebbles, and, cobbles, that, now, make, up, kata, tjuta, the, similar, mineral, composition, of, the, mutitjulu, arkose, and, the, granite, ranges, to, the, south, is, now, explained, the, ancestors, of, the, ranges, to, the, south, were, once, much, larger, than, the, eroded, remnants, we, see, today, they, were, thrust, up, during, a, mountain, building, episode, referred, to, as, the, petermann, orogeny, that, took, place, in, late, neoproterozoic, to, early, cambrian, times, 550, 530, ma, and, thus, the, mutitjulu, arkose, is, believed, to, have, been, deposited, at, about, the, same, time, hence, then, in, gondwana, now, in, australia, the, arkose, sandstone, that, makes, up, the, formation, is, composed, of, grains, that, show, little, sorting, based, on, grain, size, and, exhibit, very, little, rounding, the, feldspars, in, the, rock, are, relatively, fresh, in, appearance, this, lack, of, sorting, and, grain, rounding, is, typical, of, arkosic, sandstones, and, is, indicative, of, relatively, rapid, erosion, from, the, granites, of, the, growing, mountains, to, the, south, the, layers, of, sand, were, nearly, horizontal, when, deposited, but, were, tilted, to, their, near, vertical, position, during, a, later, episode, of, mountain, building, possibly, the, alice, springs, orogeny, of, palaeozoic, age, 400, 300, ma, as, with, many, sites, around, australia, there, are, stories, from, the, dreaming, associated, with, uluru, that, date, back, thousands, of, years, according, to, the, a, angu, traditional, landowners, of, uluru, the, world, was, once, a, featureless, place, none, of, the, places, we, know, existed, until, creator, beings, in, the, forms, of, people, plants, and, animals, travelled, widely, across, the, land, then, in, a, process, of, creation, and, destruction, they, formed, the, landscape, as, we, know, it, today, a, angu, land, is, still, inhabited, by, the, spirits, of, dozens, of, these, ancestral, creator, beings, which, are, referred, to, as, tjukuritja, or, waparitja, there, are, a, number, of, differing, accounts, given, by, outsiders, of, aboriginal, ancestral, stories, for, the, origins, of, uluru, and, its, many, cracks, and, fissures, one, such, account, taken, from, robert, layton, s, 1989, uluru, an, aboriginal, history, of, ayers, rock, reads, as, follows, uluru, was, built, up, during, the, creation, period, by, two, boys, who, played, in, the, mud, after, rain, when, they, had, finished, their, game, they, travelled, south, to, wiputa, fighting, together, the, two, boys, made, their, way, to, the, table, topped, mount, conner, on, top, of, which, their, bodies, are, preserved, as, boulders, page, 5, two, other, accounts, are, given, in, norbert, brockman, s, 1997, encyclopedia, of, sacred, places, the, first, tells, of, serpents, who, waged, many, wars, around, uluru, scarring, the, rock, the, second, tells, of, two, tribes, of, ancestral, spirits, who, were, invited, to, a, feast, but, were, distracted, by, the, beautiful, sleepy, lizard, women, and, did, not, show, up, in, response, the, angry, hosts, sang, evil, into, a, mud, sculpture, that, came, to, life, as, the, dingo, there, followed, a, great, battle, which, ended, in, the, deaths, of, the, leaders, of, both, tribes, the, earth, itself, rose, up, in, grief, at, the, bloodshed, becoming, uluru, the, commonwealth, department, of, environment, s, webpage, advises, many, other, tjukurpa, such, as, kalaya, emu, liru, poisonous, snake, lungkata, blue, tongue, lizard, luunpa, kingfisher, and, tjintir, tjintirpa, willie, wagtail, travel, through, ulu, u, kata, tju, a, national, park, other, tjukurpa, affect, only, one, specific, area, many, exploits, of, tjukurpa, involve, ancestral, beings, going, underground, kuniya, the, woma, python, lived, in, the, rocks, at, uluru, where, she, fought, the, liru, the, poisonous, snake, it, is, sometimes, reported, that, those, who, take, rocks, from, the, formation, will, be, cursed, and, suffer, misfortune, there, have, been, many, instances, where, people, who, removed, such, rocks, attempted, to, mail, them, back, to, various, agencies, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, perceived, curse, one, of, the, major, stories, associated, with, uluru, is, the, mala, story, in, this, the, mala, rufous, hare, wallaby, people, came, from, the, north, and, decided, to, stay, at, uluru, for, a, while, and, perform, the, ceremony, known, as, inma, the, men, decorated, and, raised, the, ceremonial, pole, ngaltawata, and, began, inma, while, the, women, gathered, and, prepared, bush, food, storing, seed, cakes, nyuma, in, their, caves, the, men, hunted, made, fires, and, fixed, their, tools, and, weapons, two, wintalka, men, approached, from, the, west, and, invited, the, mala, people, to, attend, their, inma, but, the, mala, people, declined, the, invitation, as, their, inma, had, begun, and, could, not, be, stopped, the, wintalka, men, went, back, and, told, their, people, who, got, angry, and, created, an, evil, spirit, in, the, form, of, an, enormous, devil, dog, called, kurpany, in, order, to, wreck, the, mala, inma, kurpany, approached, the, mala, people, changing, form, as, he, did, so, including, taking, the, form, of, a, ghost, mamu, luunpa, the, kingfisher, woman, spied, him, first, and, warned, the, mala, people, however, they, did, not, listen, to, her, kurpany, attacked, and, killed, some, of, the, men, and, the, remaining, mala, people, fled, southwards, into, what, is, now, the, state, of, south, australia, with, kurpany, in, pursuit, this, story, continues, among, the, indigenous, peoples, of, south, australia, a, angu, believe, that, the, ancestors, still, exist, at, uluru, today, luunpa, now, a, large, rock, keeps, watch, while, the, men, killed, by, kurpany, are, still, in, their, cave, kurpany, s, footprints, heading, eastwards, and, southwards, are, still, in, the, rock, the, teaching, from, this, story, is, that, people, need, to, heed, warnings, of, danger, and, to, finish, what, they, have, begun, historically, 46, species, of, native, mammals, are, known, to, have, been, living, near, uluru, according, to, recent, surveys, there, are, currently, 21, a, angu, acknowledge, that, a, decrease, in, the, number, has, implications, for, the, condition, and, health, of, the, landscape, moves, are, supported, for, the, reintroduction, of, locally, extinct, animals, such, as, malleefowl, common, brushtail, possum, rufous, hare, wallaby, or, mala, bilby, burrowing, bettong, and, the, black, flanked, rock, wallaby, the, mulgara, is, mostly, restricted, to, the, transitional, sand, plain, area, a, narrow, band, of, country, that, stretches, from, the, vicinity, of, uluru, to, the, northern, boundary, of, the, park, and, into, ayers, rock, resort, this, area, also, contains, the, marsupial, mole, woma, python, and, great, desert, skink, the, bat, population, of, the, park, comprises, at, least, seven, species, that, depend, on, day, roosting, sites, within, caves, and, crevices, of, uluru, and, kata, tjuta, most, of, the, bats, forage, for,
