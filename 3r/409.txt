the, sahara, s, h, r, s, h, r, is, a, desert, spanning, across, north, africa, with, an, area, of, 9, 200, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 600, 000, sq, mi, it, is, the, largest, hot, desert, in, the, world, and, the, third, largest, desert, overall, smaller, only, than, the, deserts, of, antarctica, and, the, northern, arctic, the, name, sahara, is, derived, from, arabic, romanized, a, r, s, a, a, ra, a, broken, plural, form, of, a, r, s, a, ra, meaning, desert, the, desert, covers, much, of, north, africa, excluding, the, fertile, region, on, the, mediterranean, sea, coast, the, atlas, mountains, of, the, maghreb, and, the, nile, valley, in, egypt, and, the, sudan, it, stretches, from, the, red, sea, in, the, east, and, the, mediterranean, in, the, north, to, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, west, where, the, landscape, gradually, changes, from, desert, to, coastal, plains, to, the, south, it, is, bounded, by, the, sahel, a, belt, of, semi, arid, tropical, savanna, around, the, niger, river, valley, and, the, sudan, region, of, sub, saharan, africa, the, sahara, can, be, divided, into, several, regions, including, the, western, sahara, the, central, ahaggar, mountains, the, tibesti, mountains, the, a, r, mountains, the, t, n, r, desert, and, the, libyan, desert, for, several, hundred, thousand, years, the, sahara, has, alternated, between, desert, and, savanna, grassland, in, a, 20, 000, year, cycle, caused, by, the, precession, of, earth, s, axis, about, 26, 000, years, as, it, rotates, around, the, sun, which, changes, the, location, of, the, north, african, monsoon, the, sahara, covers, large, parts, of, algeria, chad, egypt, libya, mali, mauritania, niger, western, sahara, and, sudan, and, parts, of, southern, morocco, and, tunisia, it, covers, 9, million, square, kilometres, 3, 500, 000, sq, mi, 31, of, the, african, continent, if, all, areas, with, a, mean, annual, precipitation, of, less, than, 250, mm, 9, 8, in, were, included, the, sahara, would, be, 11, million, square, kilometres, 4, 200, 000, sq, mi, it, is, one, of, three, distinct, physiographic, provinces, of, the, african, massive, physiographic, division, the, sahara, is, so, large, and, bright, that, in, theory, it, could, be, detected, from, other, stars, as, a, surface, feature, of, earth, with, near, current, technology, the, sahara, is, mainly, rocky, hamada, stone, plateaus, ergs, sand, seas, large, areas, covered, with, sand, dunes, form, only, a, minor, part, contrary, to, common, misconception, but, many, of, the, sand, dunes, are, over, 180, metres, 590, ft, high, wind, or, rare, rainfall, shape, the, desert, features, sand, dunes, dune, fields, sand, seas, stone, plateaus, gravel, plains, reg, dry, valleys, wadi, dry, lakes, oued, and, salt, flats, shatt, or, chott, unusual, landforms, include, the, richat, structure, in, mauritania, several, deeply, dissected, mountains, many, volcanic, rise, from, the, desert, including, the, a, r, mountains, ahaggar, mountains, saharan, atlas, tibesti, mountains, adrar, des, iforas, and, the, red, sea, hills, the, highest, peak, in, the, sahara, is, emi, koussi, a, shield, volcano, in, the, tibesti, range, of, northern, chad, the, central, sahara, is, hyperarid, with, sparse, vegetation, the, northern, and, southern, reaches, of, the, desert, along, with, the, highlands, have, areas, of, sparse, grassland, and, desert, shrub, with, trees, and, taller, shrubs, in, wadis, where, moisture, collects, in, the, central, hyperarid, region, there, are, many, subdivisions, of, the, great, desert, tanezrouft, the, t, n, r, the, libyan, desert, the, eastern, desert, the, nubian, desert, and, others, these, extremely, arid, areas, often, receive, no, rain, for, years, to, the, north, the, sahara, skirts, the, mediterranean, sea, in, egypt, and, portions, of, libya, but, in, cyrenaica, and, the, maghreb, the, sahara, borders, the, mediterranean, forest, woodland, and, scrub, eco, regions, of, northern, africa, all, of, which, have, a, mediterranean, climate, characterized, by, hot, summers, and, cool, and, rainy, winters, according, to, the, botanical, criteria, of, frank, white, and, geographer, robert, capot, rey, the, northern, limit, of, the, sahara, corresponds, to, the, northern, limit, of, date, palm, cultivation, and, the, southern, limit, of, the, range, of, esparto, a, grass, typical, of, the, mediterranean, climate, portion, of, the, maghreb, and, iberia, the, northern, limit, also, corresponds, to, the, 100, mm, 3, 9, in, isohyet, of, annual, precipitation, to, the, south, the, sahara, is, bounded, by, the, sahel, a, belt, of, dry, tropical, savanna, with, a, summer, rainy, season, that, extends, across, africa, from, east, to, west, the, southern, limit, of, the, sahara, is, indicated, botanically, by, the, southern, limit, of, cornulaca, monacantha, a, drought, tolerant, member, of, the, chenopodiaceae, or, northern, limit, of, cenchrus, biflorus, a, grass, typical, of, the, sahel, according, to, climatic, criteria, the, southern, limit, of, the, sahara, corresponds, to, the, 150, mm, 5, 9, in, isohyet, of, annual, precipitation, this, is, a, long, term, average, since, precipitation, varies, annually, important, cities, located, in, the, sahara, include, nouakchott, the, capital, of, mauritania, tamanrasset, ouargla, b, char, hassi, messaoud, gharda, a, and, el, oued, in, algeria, timbuktu, in, mali, agadez, in, niger, ghat, in, libya, and, faya, largeau, in, chad, the, sahara, is, the, world, s, largest, hot, desert, it, is, located, in, the, horse, latitudes, under, the, subtropical, ridge, a, significant, belt, of, semi, permanent, subtropical, warm, core, high, pressure, where, the, air, from, the, upper, troposphere, usually, descends, warming, and, drying, the, lower, troposphere, and, preventing, cloud, formation, the, permanent, absence, of, clouds, allows, unhindered, light, and, thermal, radiation, the, stability, of, the, atmosphere, above, the, desert, prevents, any, convective, overturning, thus, making, rainfall, virtually, non, existent, as, a, consequence, the, weather, tends, to, be, sunny, dry, and, stable, with, a, minimal, chance, of, rainfall, subsiding, diverging, dry, air, masses, associated, with, subtropical, high, pressure, systems, are, extremely, unfavorable, for, the, development, of, convectional, showers, the, subtropical, ridge, is, the, predominant, factor, that, explains, the, hot, desert, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, bwh, of, this, vast, region, the, descending, airflow, is, the, strongest, and, the, most, effective, over, the, eastern, part, of, the, great, desert, in, the, libyan, desert, this, is, the, sunniest, driest, and, the, most, nearly, rainless, place, on, the, planet, rivaling, the, atacama, desert, lying, in, chile, and, peru, the, rainfall, inhibition, and, the, dissipation, of, cloud, cover, are, most, accentuated, over, the, eastern, section, of, the, sahara, rather, than, the, western, the, prevailing, air, mass, lying, above, the, sahara, is, the, continental, tropical, ct, air, mass, which, is, hot, and, dry, hot, dry, air, masses, primarily, form, over, the, north, african, desert, from, the, heating, of, the, vast, continental, land, area, and, it, affects, the, whole, desert, during, most, of, the, year, because, of, this, extreme, heating, process, a, thermal, low, is, usually, noticed, near, the, surface, and, is, the, strongest, and, the, most, developed, during, the, summertime, the, sahara, high, represents, the, eastern, continental, extension, of, the, azores, high, centered, over, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, subsidence, of, the, sahara, high, nearly, reaches, the, ground, during, the, coolest, part, of, the, year, while, it, is, confined, to, the, upper, troposphere, during, the, hottest, periods, the, effects, of, local, surface, low, pressure, are, extremely, limited, because, upper, level, subsidence, still, continues, to, block, any, form, of, air, ascent, also, to, be, protected, against, rain, bearing, weather, systems, by, the, atmospheric, circulation, itself, the, desert, is, made, even, drier, by, its, geographical, configuration, and, location, indeed, the, extreme, aridity, of, the, sahara, is, not, only, explained, by, the, subtropical, high, pressure, the, atlas, mountains, of, algeria, morocco, and, tunisia, also, help, to, enhance, the, aridity, of, the, northern, part, of, the, desert, these, major, mountain, ranges, act, as, a, barrier, causing, a, strong, rain, shadow, effect, on, the, leeward, side, by, dropping, much, of, the, humidity, brought, by, atmospheric, disturbances, along, the, polar, front, which, affects, the, surrounding, mediterranean, climates, the, primary, source, of, rain, in, the, sahara, is, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, a, continuous, belt, of, low, pressure, systems, near, the, equator, which, bring, the, brief, short, and, irregular, rainy, season, to, the, sahel, and, southern, sahara, rainfall, in, this, giant, desert, has, to, overcome, the, physical, and, atmospheric, barriers, that, normally, prevent, the, production, of, precipitation, the, harsh, climate, of, the, sahara, is, characterized, by, extremely, low, unreliable, highly, erratic, rainfall, extremely, high, sunshine, duration, values, high, temperatures, year, round, negligible, rates, of, relative, humidity, a, significant, diurnal, temperature, variation, and, extremely, high, levels, of, potential, evaporation, which, are, the, highest, recorded, worldwide, the, sky, is, usually, clear, above, the, desert, and, the, sunshine, duration, is, extremely, high, everywhere, in, the, sahara, most, of, the, desert, has, more, than, 3, 600, hours, of, bright, sunshine, per, year, over, 82, of, daylight, hours, and, a, wide, area, in, the, eastern, part, has, over, 4, 000, hours, of, bright, sunshine, per, year, over, 91, of, daylight, hours, the, highest, values, are, very, close, to, the, theoretical, maximum, value, a, value, of, 4300, hours, 98, of, the, time, would, be, recorded, in, upper, egypt, aswan, luxor, and, in, the, nubian, desert, wadi, halfa, the, annual, average, direct, solar, irradiation, is, around, 2, 800, kwh, m, 2, year, in, the, great, desert, the, sahara, has, a, huge, potential, for, solar, energy, production, the, high, position, of, the, sun, the, extremely, low, relative, humidity, and, the, lack, of, vegetation, and, rainfall, make, the, great, desert, the, hottest, large, region, in, the, world, and, the, hottest, place, on, earth, during, summer, in, some, spots, the, average, high, temperature, exceeds, 38, to, 40, c, 100, 4, to, 104, 0, f, during, the, hottest, month, nearly, everywhere, in, the, desert, except, at, very, high, altitudes, the, world, s, highest, officially, recorded, average, daily, high, temperature, was, 47, c, 116, 6, f, in, a, remote, desert, town, in, the, algerian, desert, called, bou, bernous, at, an, elevation, of, 378, metres, 1, 240, ft, above, sea, level, and, only, death, valley, california, rivals, it, other, hot, spots, in, algeria, such, as, adrar, timimoun, in, salah, ouallene, aoulef, reggane, with, an, elevation, between, 200, and, 400, metres, 660, and, 1, 310, ft, above, sea, level, get, slightly, lower, summer, average, highs, around, 46, c, 114, 8, f, during, the, hottest, months, of, the, year, salah, well, known, in, algeria, for, its, extreme, heat, has, average, high, temperatures, of, 43, 8, c, 110, 8, f, 46, 4, c, 115, 5, f, 45, 5, c, 113, 9, f, and, 41, 9, c, 107, 4, f, in, june, july, august, and, september, respectively, there, are, even, hotter, spots, in, the, sahara, but, they, are, located, in, extremely, remote, areas, especially, in, the, azalai, lying, in, northern, mali, the, major, part, of, the, desert, experiences, around, three, to, five, months, when, the, average, high, strictly, exceeds, 40, c, 104, f, while, in, the, southern, central, part, of, the, desert, there, are, up, to, six, or, seven, months, when, the, average, high, temperature, strictly, exceeds, 40, c, 104, f, some, examples, of, this, are, bilma, niger, and, faya, largeau, chad, the, annual, average, daily, temperature, exceeds, 20, c, 68, f, everywhere, and, can, approach, 30, c, 86, f, in, the, hottest, regions, year, round, however, most, of, the, desert, has, a, value, in, excess, of, 25, c, 77, f, sand, and, ground, temperatures, are, even, more, extreme, during, daytime, the, sand, temperature, is, extremely, high, it, can, easily, reach, 80, c, 176, f, or, more, a, sand, temperature, of, 83, 5, c, 182, 3, f, has, been, recorded, in, port, sudan, ground, temperatures, of, 72, c, 161, 6, f, have, been, recorded, in, the, adrar, of, mauritania, and, a, value, of, 75, c, 167, f, has, been, measured, in, borkou, northern, chad, due, to, lack, of, cloud, cover, and, very, low, humidity, the, desert, usually, has, high, diurnal, temperature, variations, between, days, and, nights, however, it, is, a, myth, that, the, nights, are, especially, cold, after, extremely, hot, days, in, the, sahara, on, average, nighttime, temperatures, tend, to, be, 13, 20, c, 23, 36, f, cooler, than, in, the, daytime, the, smallest, variations, are, found, along, the, coastal, regions, due, to, high, humidity, and, are, often, even, lower, than, a, 10, c, 18, f, difference, while, the, largest, variations, are, found, in, inland, desert, areas, where, the, humidity, is, the, lowest, mainly, in, the, southern, sahara, still, it, is, true, that, winter, nights, can, be, cold, as, it, can, drop, to, the, freezing, point, and, even, below, especially, in, high, elevation, areas, the, frequency, of, subfreezing, winter, nights, in, the, sahara, is, strongly, influenced, by, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, nao, with, warmer, winter, temperatures, during, negative, nao, events, and, cooler, winters, with, more, frosts, when, the, nao, is, positive, this, is, because, the, weaker, clockwise, flow, around, the, eastern, side, of, the, subtropical, anticyclone, during, negative, nao, winters, although, too, dry, to, produce, more, than, negligible, precipitation, does, reduce, the, flow, of, dry, cold, air, from, higher, latitudes, of, eurasia, into, the, sahara, significantly, the, average, annual, rainfall, ranges, from, very, low, in, the, northern, and, southern, fringes, of, the, desert, to, nearly, non, existent, over, the, central, and, the, eastern, part, the, thin, northern, fringe, of, the, desert, receives, more, winter, cloudiness, and, rainfall, due, to, the, arrival, of, low, pressure, systems, over, the, mediterranean, sea, along, the, polar, front, although, very, attenuated, by, the, rain, shadow, effects, of, the, mountains, and, the, annual, average, rainfall, ranges, from, 100, millimetres, 4, in, to, 250, millimetres, 10, in, for, example, biskra, algeria, and, ouarzazate, morocco, are, found, in, this, zone, the, southern, fringe, of, the, desert, along, the, border, with, the, sahel, receives, summer, cloudiness, and, rainfall, due, to, the, arrival, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, from, the, south, and, the, annual, average, rainfall, ranges, from, 100, millimetres, 4, in, to, 250, millimetres, 10, in, for, example, timbuktu, mali, and, agadez, niger, are, found, in, this, zone, the, vast, central, hyper, arid, core, of, the, desert, is, virtually, never, affected, by, northerly, or, southerly, atmospheric, disturbances, and, permanently, remains, under, the, influence, of, the, strongest, anticyclonic, weather, regime, and, the, annual, average, rainfall, can, drop, to, less, than, 1, millimetre, 0, 04, in, in, fact, most, of, the, sahara, receives, less, than, 20, millimetres, 0, 8, in, of, the, 9, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 500, 000, sq, mi, of, desert, land, in, the, sahara, an, area, of, about, 2, 800, 000, square, kilometres, 1, 100, 000, sq, mi, about, 31, of, the, total, area, receives, an, annual, average, rainfall, amount, of, 10, millimetres, 0, 4, in, or, less, while, some, 1, 500, 000, square, kilometres, 580, 000, sq, mi, about, 17, of, the, total, area, receives, an, average, of, 5, millimetres, 0, 2, in, or, less, the, annual, average, rainfall, is, virtually, zero, over, a, wide, area, of, some, 1, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 390, 000, sq, mi, in, the, eastern, sahara, comprising, deserts, of, libya, egypt, and, sudan, tazirbu, kufra, dakhla, kharga, farafra, siwa, asyut, sohag, luxor, aswan, abu, simbel, wadi, halfa, where, the, long, term, mean, approximates, 0, 5, millimetres, 0, 02, in, per, year, rainfall, is, very, unreliable, and, erratic, in, the, sahara, as, it, may, vary, considerably, year, by, year, in, full, contrast, to, the, negligible, annual, rainfall, amounts, the, annual, rates, of, potential, evaporation, are, extraordinarily, high, roughly, ranging, from, 2, 500, millimetres, 100, in, per, year, to, more, than, 6, 000, millimetres, 240, in, per, year, in, the, whole, desert, nowhere, else, on, earth, has, air, been, found, as, dry, and, evaporative, as, in, the, sahara, region, however, at, least, two, instances, of, snowfall, have, been, recorded, in, sahara, in, february, 1979, and, december, 2016, both, in, the, town, of, ain, sefra, one, theory, for, the, formation, of, the, sahara, is, that, the, monsoon, in, northern, africa, was, weakened, because, of, glaciation, during, the, quaternary, period, starting, two, or, three, million, years, ago, another, theory, is, that, the, monsoon, was, weakened, when, the, ancient, tethys, sea, dried, up, during, the, tortonian, period, around, 7, million, years, ago, the, climate, of, the, sahara, has, undergone, enormous, variations, between, wet, and, dry, over, the, last, few, hundred, thousand, years, believed, to, be, caused, by, long, term, changes, in, the, north, african, climate, cycle, that, alters, the, path, of, the, north, african, monsoon, usually, southward, the, cycle, is, caused, by, a, 41, 000, year, cycle, in, which, the, tilt, of, the, earth, changes, between, 22, and, 24, 5, at, present, it, is, in, a, dry, period, but, it, is, expected, that, the, sahara, will, become, green, again, in, 15, 000, years, when, the, north, african, monsoon, is, at, its, strongest, annual, precipitation, and, subsequent, vegetation, in, the, sahara, region, increase, resulting, in, conditions, commonly, referred, to, as, the, green, sahara, for, a, relatively, weak, north, african, monsoon, the, opposite, is, true, with, decreased, annual, precipitation, and, less, vegetation, resulting, in, a, phase, of, the, sahara, climate, cycle, known, as, the, desert, sahara, the, idea, that, changes, in, insolation, solar, heating, caused, by, long, term, changes, in, earth, s, orbit, are, a, controlling, factor, for, the, long, term, variations, in, the, strength, of, monsoon, patterns, across, the, globe, was, first, suggested, by, rudolf, spitaler, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, hypothesis, was, later, formally, proposed, and, tested, by, the, meteorologist, john, kutzbach, in, 1981, kutzbach, s, ideas, about, the, impacts, of, insolation, on, global, monsoonal, patterns, have, become, widely, accepted, today, as, the, underlying, driver, of, long, term, monsoonal, cycles, kutzbach, never, formally, named, his, hypothesis, and, as, such, it, is, referred, to, here, as, the, orbital, monsoon, hypothesis, as, suggested, by, ruddiman, in, 2001, during, the, last, glacial, period, the, sahara, was, much, larger, than, it, is, today, extending, south, beyond, its, current, boundaries, the, end, of, the, glacial, period, brought, more, rain, to, the, sahara, from, about, 8000, bce, to, 6000, bce, perhaps, because, of, low, pressure, areas, over, the, collapsing, ice, sheets, to, the, north, once, the, ice, sheets, were, gone, the, northern, sahara, dried, out, in, the, southern, sahara, the, drying, trend, was, initially, counteracted, by, the, monsoon, which, brought, rain, further, north, than, it, does, today, by, around, 4200, bce, however, the, monsoon, retreated, south, to, approximately, where, it, is, today, leading, to, the, gradual, desertification, of, the, sahara, the, sahara, is, now, as, dry, as, it, was, about, 13, 000, years, ago, lake, chad, is, the, remnant, of, a, former, inland, sea, paleolake, mega, chad, which, existed, during, the, african, humid, period, at, its, largest, extent, sometime, before, 5000, bce, lake, mega, chad, was, the, largest, of, four, saharan, paleolakes, and, is, estimated, to, have, covered, an, area, of, 350, 000, km, 2, the, sahara, pump, theory, describes, this, cycle, during, periods, of, a, wet, or, green, sahara, the, sahara, becomes, a, savanna, grassland, and, various, flora, and, fauna, become, more, common, following, inter, pluvial, arid, periods, the, sahara, area, then, reverts, to, desert, conditions, and, the, flora, and, fauna, are, forced, to, retreat, northwards, to, the, atlas, mountains, southwards, into, west, africa, or, eastwards, into, the, nile, valley, this, separates, populations, of, some, of, the, species, in, areas, with, different, climates, forcing, them, to, adapt, possibly, giving, rise, to, allopatric, speciation, it, is, also, proposed, that, humans, accelerated, the, drying, out, period, from, 6000, to, 2500, bce, by, pastoralists, overgrazing, available, grassland, the, growth, of, speleothems, which, requires, rainwater, was, detected, in, hol, zakh, ashalim, even, sid, ma, ale, ha, meyshar, ktora, cracks, nagev, tzavoa, cave, and, elsewhere, and, has, allowed, tracking, of, prehistoric, rainfall, the, red, sea, coastal, route, was, extremely, arid, before, 140, and, after, 115, kya, thousands, of, years, ago, slightly, wetter, conditions, appear, at, 90, 87, kya, but, it, still, was, just, one, tenth, the, rainfall, around, 125, kya, in, the, southern, negev, desert, speleothems, did, not, grow, between, 185, and, 140, kya, mis, 6, 110, 90, mis, 5, 4, 5, 2, nor, after, 85, kya, nor, during, most, of, the, interglacial, period, mis, 5, 1, the, glacial, period, and, holocene, this, suggests, that, the, southern, negev, was, arid, to, hyper, arid, in, these, periods, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, the, sahara, was, more, extensive, than, it, is, now, with, the, extent, of, the, tropical, forests, being, greatly, reduced, and, the, lower, temperatures, reduced, the, strength, of, the, hadley, cell, this, is, a, climate, cell, which, causes, rising, tropical, air, of, the, inter, tropical, convergence, zone, itcz, to, bring, rain, to, the, tropics, while, dry, descending, air, at, about, 20, degrees, north, flows, back, to, the, equator, and, brings, desert, conditions, to, this, region, it, is, associated, with, high, rates, of, wind, blown, mineral, dust, and, these, dust, levels, are, found, as, expected, in, marine, cores, from, the, north, tropical, atlantic, but, around, 12, 500, bce, the, amount, of, dust, in, the, cores, in, the, b, lling, aller, d, phase, suddenly, plummets, and, shows, a, period, of, much, wetter, conditions, in, the, sahara, indicating, a, dansgaard, oeschger, do, event, a, sudden, warming, followed, by, a, slower, cooling, of, the, climate, the, moister, saharan, conditions, had, begun, about, 12, 500, bce, with, the, extension, of, the, itcz, northward, in, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, bringing, moist, wet, conditions, and, a, savanna, climate, to, the, sahara, which,

oscillation, cycle, led, to, a, rapid, drying, out, of, the, saharan, and, arabian, regions, which, quickly, became, desert, this, is, linked, to, a, marked, decline, in, the, scale, of, the, nile, floods, between, 2700, and, 2100, bce, the, sahara, comprises, several, distinct, ecoregions, with, their, variations, in, temperature, rainfall, elevation, and, soil, these, regions, harbor, distinct, communities, of, plants, and, animals, the, flora, of, the, sahara, is, highly, diversified, based, on, the, bio, geographical, characteristics, of, this, vast, desert, floristically, the, sahara, has, three, zones, based, on, the, amount, of, rainfall, received, the, northern, mediterranean, central, and, southern, zones, there, are, two, transitional, zones, the, mediterranean, sahara, transition, and, the, sahel, transition, zone, the, saharan, flora, comprises, around, 2800, species, of, vascular, plants, approximately, a, quarter, of, these, are, endemic, about, half, of, these, species, are, common, to, the, flora, of, the, arabian, deserts, the, central, sahara, is, estimated, to, include, five, hundred, species, of, plants, which, is, extremely, low, considering, the, huge, extent, of, the, area, plants, such, as, acacia, trees, palms, succulents, spiny, shrubs, and, grasses, have, adapted, to, the, arid, conditions, by, growing, lower, to, avoid, water, loss, by, strong, winds, by, storing, water, in, their, thick, stems, to, use, it, in, dry, periods, by, having, long, roots, that, travel, horizontally, to, reach, the, maximum, area, of, water, and, to, find, any, surface, moisture, and, by, having, small, thick, leaves, or, needles, to, prevent, water, loss, by, evapotranspiration, plant, leaves, may, dry, out, totally, and, then, recover, several, species, of, fox, live, in, the, sahara, including, the, fennec, fox, pale, fox, and, r, ppell, s, fox, the, addax, a, large, white, antelope, can, go, nearly, a, year, in, the, desert, without, drinking, the, dorcas, gazelle, is, a, north, african, gazelle, that, can, also, go, for, a, long, time, without, water, other, notable, gazelles, include, the, rhim, gazelle, and, dama, gazelle, the, saharan, cheetah, northwest, african, cheetah, lives, in, algeria, togo, niger, mali, benin, and, burkina, faso, there, remain, fewer, than, 250, mature, cheetahs, which, are, very, cautious, fleeing, any, human, presence, the, cheetah, avoids, the, sun, from, april, to, october, seeking, the, shelter, of, shrubs, such, as, balanites, and, acacias, they, are, unusually, pale, the, other, cheetah, subspecies, northeast, african, cheetah, lives, in, chad, sudan, and, the, eastern, region, of, niger, however, it, is, currently, extinct, in, the, wild, in, egypt, and, libya, there, are, approximately, 2000, mature, individuals, left, in, the, wild, other, animals, include, the, monitor, lizards, hyrax, sand, vipers, and, small, populations, of, african, wild, dog, in, perhaps, only, 14, countries, and, red, necked, ostrich, other, animals, exist, in, the, sahara, birds, in, particular, such, as, african, silverbill, and, black, faced, firefinch, among, others, there, are, also, small, desert, crocodiles, in, mauritania, and, the, ennedi, plateau, of, chad, the, deathstalker, scorpion, can, be, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, long, its, venom, contains, large, amounts, of, agitoxin, and, scyllatoxin, and, is, very, dangerous, however, a, sting, from, this, scorpion, rarely, kills, a, healthy, adult, the, saharan, silver, ant, is, unique, in, that, due, to, the, extreme, high, temperatures, of, their, habitat, and, the, threat, of, predators, the, ants, are, active, outside, their, nest, for, only, about, ten, minutes, per, day, dromedary, camels, and, goats, are, the, domesticated, animals, most, commonly, found, in, the, sahara, because, of, its, qualities, of, endurance, and, speed, the, dromedary, is, the, favourite, animal, used, by, nomads, human, activities, are, more, likely, to, affect, the, habitat, in, areas, of, permanent, water, oases, or, where, water, comes, close, to, the, surface, here, the, local, pressure, on, natural, resources, can, be, intense, the, remaining, populations, of, large, mammals, have, been, greatly, reduced, by, hunting, for, food, and, recreation, in, recent, years, development, projects, have, started, in, the, deserts, of, algeria, and, tunisia, using, irrigated, water, pumped, from, underground, aquifers, these, schemes, often, lead, to, soil, degradation, and, salinization, researchers, from, hacettepe, university, have, reported, that, saharan, soil, may, have, bio, available, iron, and, also, some, essential, macro, and, micro, nutrient, elements, suitable, for, use, as, fertilizer, for, growing, wheat, people, lived, on, the, edge, of, the, desert, thousands, of, years, ago, since, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, in, the, central, sahara, engraved, and, painted, rock, art, were, created, perhaps, as, early, as, 10, 000, years, ago, spanning, the, bubaline, period, kel, essuf, period, round, head, period, pastoral, period, caballine, period, and, cameline, period, the, sahara, was, then, a, much, wetter, place, than, it, is, today, over, 30, 000, petroglyphs, of, river, animals, such, as, crocodiles, survive, with, half, found, in, the, tassili, n, ajjer, in, southeast, algeria, fossils, of, dinosaurs, including, afrovenator, jobaria, and, ouranosaurus, have, also, been, found, here, the, modern, sahara, though, is, not, lush, in, vegetation, except, in, the, nile, valley, at, a, few, oases, and, in, the, northern, highlands, where, mediterranean, plants, such, as, the, olive, tree, are, found, to, grow, shifts, in, earth, s, axis, increased, temperatures, and, decreased, precipitation, which, caused, an, abrupt, beginning, of, north, africa, desertification, about, 5, 400, years, ago, the, kiffian, culture, is, a, prehistoric, industry, or, domain, that, existed, between, 10, 000, and, 8, 000, years, ago, in, the, sahara, during, the, neolithic, subpluvial, human, remains, from, this, culture, were, found, in, 2000, at, a, site, known, as, gobero, located, in, niger, in, the, t, n, r, desert, the, site, is, known, as, the, largest, and, earliest, grave, of, stone, age, people, in, the, sahara, the, kiffians, were, skilled, hunters, bones, of, many, large, savannah, animals, that, were, discovered, in, the, same, area, suggest, that, they, lived, on, the, shores, of, a, lake, that, was, present, during, the, holocene, wet, phase, a, period, when, the, sahara, was, verdant, and, wet, the, kiffian, people, were, tall, standing, over, six, feet, in, height, craniometric, analysis, indicates, that, this, early, holocene, population, was, closely, related, to, the, late, pleistocene, iberomaurusians, and, early, holocene, capsians, of, the, maghreb, as, well, as, mid, holocene, mechta, groups, traces, of, the, kiffian, culture, do, not, exist, after, 8, 000, years, ago, as, the, sahara, went, through, a, dry, period, for, the, next, thousand, years, after, this, time, the, tenerian, culture, colonized, the, area, gobero, was, discovered, in, 2000, during, an, archaeological, expedition, led, by, paul, sereno, which, sought, dinosaur, remains, two, distinct, prehistoric, cultures, were, discovered, at, the, site, the, early, holocene, kiffian, culture, and, the, middle, holocene, tenerian, culture, the, post, kiffian, desiccation, lasted, until, around, 4600, bce, when, the, earliest, artefacts, associated, with, the, tenerians, have, been, dated, to, some, 200, skeletons, have, been, discovered, at, gobero, the, tenerians, were, considerably, shorter, in, height, and, less, robust, than, the, earlier, kiffians, craniometric, analysis, also, indicates, that, they, were, osteologically, distinct, the, kiffian, skulls, are, akin, to, those, of, the, late, pleistocene, iberomaurusians, early, holocene, capsians, and, mid, holocene, mechta, groups, whereas, the, tenerian, crania, are, more, like, those, of, mediterranean, groups, graves, show, that, the, tenerians, observed, spiritual, traditions, as, they, were, buried, with, artifacts, such, as, jewelry, made, of, hippo, tusks, and, clay, pots, the, most, interesting, find, is, a, triple, burial, dated, to, 5300, years, ago, of, an, adult, female, and, two, children, estimated, through, their, teeth, as, being, five, and, eight, years, old, hugging, each, other, pollen, residue, indicates, they, were, buried, on, a, bed, of, flowers, the, three, are, assumed, to, have, died, within, 24, hours, of, each, other, but, as, their, skeletons, hold, no, apparent, trauma, they, did, not, die, violently, and, they, have, been, buried, so, elaborately, unlikely, if, they, had, died, of, a, plague, the, cause, of, their, deaths, is, a, mystery, uan, muhuggiag, appears, to, have, been, inhabited, from, at, least, the, 6th, millennium, bce, to, about, 2700, bce, although, not, necessarily, continuously, the, most, noteworthy, find, at, uan, muhuggiag, is, the, well, preserved, mummy, of, a, young, boy, of, approximately, 2, 1, 2, years, old, the, child, was, in, a, fetal, position, then, embalmed, then, placed, in, a, sack, made, of, antelope, skin, which, was, insulated, by, a, layer, of, leaves, the, boy, s, organs, were, removed, as, evidenced, by, incisions, in, his, stomach, and, thorax, and, an, organic, preservative, was, inserted, to, stop, his, body, from, decomposing, an, ostrich, eggshell, necklace, was, also, found, around, his, neck, radiocarbon, dating, determined, the, age, of, the, mummy, to, be, approximately, 5600, years, old, which, makes, it, about, 1000, years, older, than, the, earliest, previously, recorded, mummy, in, ancient, egypt, in, 1958, 59, an, archaeological, expedition, led, by, antonio, ascenzi, conducted, anthropological, radiological, histological, and, chemical, analyses, on, the, uan, muhuggiag, mummy, the, team, claimed, that, the, mummy, was, a, 30, month, old, child, of, uncertain, sex, they, also, found, a, long, incision, on, the, specimen, s, abdominal, wall, which, indicated, that, the, body, had, been, initially, mummified, by, evisceration, and, later, underwent, natural, desiccation, the, team, also, stated, that, the, mummy, possessed, negroid, features, however, modern, genetics, has, since, proven, that, the, final, claim, is, unscientific, and, not, supported, by, evidence, a, more, recent, publication, referenced, a, laboratory, examination, of, the, cutaneous, features, of, the, child, mummy, in, which, the, results, verified, that, the, child, possessed, a, dark, skin, complexion, one, other, individual, an, adult, was, found, at, uan, muhuggiag, buried, in, a, crouched, position, however, the, body, showed, no, evidence, of, evisceration, or, any, other, method, of, preservation, the, body, was, estimated, to, date, from, about, 7500, bp, during, the, neolithic, era, before, the, onset, of, desertification, around, 9500, bce, the, central, sudan, had, been, a, rich, environment, supporting, a, large, population, ranging, across, what, is, now, barren, desert, like, the, wadi, el, qa, ab, by, the, 5th, millennium, bce, the, people, who, inhabited, what, is, now, called, nubia, were, full, participants, in, the, agricultural, revolution, living, a, settled, lifestyle, with, domesticated, plants, and, animals, saharan, rock, art, of, cattle, and, herdsmen, suggests, the, presence, of, a, cattle, cult, like, those, found, in, sudan, and, other, pastoral, societies, in, africa, today, megaliths, found, at, nabta, playa, are, overt, examples, of, probably, the, world, s, first, known, archaeoastronomy, devices, predating, stonehenge, by, some, 2, 000, years, this, complexity, as, observed, at, nabta, playa, and, as, expressed, by, different, levels, of, authority, within, the, society, there, likely, formed, the, basis, for, the, structure, of, both, the, neolithic, society, at, nabta, and, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, archaeological, evidence, has, attested, that, population, settlements, occurred, in, nubia, as, early, as, the, late, pleistocene, era, and, from, the, 5th, millennium, bc, onwards, whereas, there, is, no, or, scanty, evidence, of, human, presence, in, the, egyptian, nile, valley, during, these, periods, which, may, be, due, to, problems, in, site, preservation, by, 6000, bce, predynastic, egyptians, in, the, southwestern, corner, of, egypt, were, herding, cattle, and, constructing, large, buildings, subsistence, in, organized, and, permanent, settlements, in, predynastic, egypt, by, the, middle, of, the, 6th, millennium, bce, centered, predominantly, on, cereal, and, animal, agriculture, cattle, goats, pigs, and, sheep, metal, objects, replaced, prior, ones, of, stone, tanning, of, animal, skins, pottery, and, weaving, were, commonplace, in, this, era, also, there, are, indications, of, seasonal, or, only, temporary, occupation, of, the, al, fayyum, in, the, 6th, millennium, bce, with, food, activities, centering, on, fishing, hunting, and, food, gathering, stone, arrowheads, knives, and, scrapers, from, the, era, are, commonly, found, burial, items, included, pottery, jewelry, farming, and, hunting, equipment, and, assorted, foods, including, dried, meat, and, fruit, burial, in, desert, environments, appears, to, enhance, egyptian, preservation, rites, and, the, dead, were, buried, facing, due, west, several, scholars, have, argued, that, the, african, origins, of, the, egyptian, civilisation, derived, from, pastoral, communities, which, emerged, in, both, the, egyptian, and, sudanese, regions, of, the, nile, valley, in, the, fifth, millennium, bce, by, 3400, bce, the, sahara, was, as, dry, as, it, is, today, due, to, reduced, precipitation, and, higher, temperatures, resulting, from, a, shift, in, earth, s, orbit, as, a, result, of, this, aridification, it, became, a, largely, impenetrable, barrier, to, humans, with, the, remaining, settlements, mainly, being, concentrated, around, the, numerous, oases, that, dot, the, landscape, little, trade, or, commerce, is, known, to, have, passed, through, the, interior, in, subsequent, periods, the, only, major, exception, being, the, nile, valley, the, nile, however, was, impassable, at, several, cataracts, making, trade, and, contact, by, boat, difficult, in, 4000, bce, the, start, of, sophisticated, social, structure, e, g, trade, of, cattle, as, valued, assets, developed, among, herders, amid, the, pastoral, period, of, the, sahara, saharan, pastoral, culture, e, g, fields, of, tumuli, lustrous, stone, rings, axes, was, intricate, by, 1800, bce, saharan, pastoral, culture, expanded, throughout, the, saharan, and, sahelian, regions, the, initial, stages, of, sophisticated, social, structure, among, saharan, herders, served, as, the, segue, for, the, development, of, sophisticated, hierarchies, found, in, african, settlements, such, as, dhar, tichitt, after, migrating, from, the, central, sahara, proto, mande, peoples, established, their, civilization, in, the, tichitt, region, of, the, western, sahara, the, tichitt, tradition, of, eastern, mauritania, dates, from, 2200, bce, to, 200, bce, tichitt, culture, at, dhar, n, ma, dhar, tagant, dhar, tichitt, and, dhar, walata, included, a, four, tiered, hierarchal, social, structure, farming, of, cereals, metallurgy, numerous, funerary, tombs, and, a, rock, art, tradition, at, dhar, tichitt, and, dhar, walata, pearl, millet, may, have, also, been, independently, tamed, amid, the, neolithic, dhar, tichitt, which, includes, dakhlet, el, atrouss, may, have, served, as, the, primary, regional, center, for, the, multi, tiered, hierarchical, social, structure, of, the, tichitt, tradition, and, the, malian, lakes, region, which, includes, tondidarou, may, have, served, as, a, second, regional, center, of, the, tichitt, tradition, the, urban, tichitt, tradition, may, have, been, the, earliest, large, scale, complexly, organized, society, in, west, africa, and, an, early, civilization, of, the, sahara, which, may, have, served, as, the, segue, for, state, formation, in, west, africa, as, areas, where, the, tichitt, cultural, tradition, were, present, dhar, tichitt, and, dhar, walata, were, occupied, more, frequently, than, dhar, n, ma, farming, of, crops, e, g, millet, may, have, been, a, feature, of, the, tichitt, cultural, tradition, as, early, as, 3rd, millennium, bce, in, dhar, tichitt, as, part, of, a, broader, trend, of, iron, metallurgy, developed, in, the, west, african, sahel, amid, 1st, millennium, bce, iron, items, 350, bce, 100, ce, were, found, at, dhar, tagant, iron, metalworking, and, or, items, 800, bce, 400, bce, were, found, at, dia, shoma, and, walald, and, the, iron, remnants, 760, bce, 400, bce, found, at, bou, khzama, and, djiganyai, the, iron, materials, that, were, found, are, evidence, of, iron, metalworking, at, dhar, tagant, in, the, late, period, of, the, tichitt, tradition, at, dhar, n, ma,

developed, into, and, persisted, as, fa, ta, facies, ceramics, between, 1300, bce, and, 400, bce, among, rammed, earth, architecture, and, iron, metallurgy, which, had, developed, after, 900, bce, thereafter, the, ghana, empire, developed, in, the, 1st, millennium, ce, the, people, of, phoenicia, who, flourished, from, 1200, to, 800, bce, created, a, chain, of, settlements, along, the, coast, of, north, africa, and, traded, extensively, with, its, inhabitants, this, put, them, in, contact, with, the, people, of, ancient, libya, who, were, the, ancestors, of, people, who, speak, berber, languages, in, north, africa, and, the, sahara, today, the, libyco, berber, alphabet, of, the, ancient, libyans, of, north, africa, seems, to, have, been, based, on, phoenician, and, its, descendant, tifinagh, is, still, used, today, by, the, berber, tuareg, of, the, central, sahara, the, periplus, of, the, phoenician, navigator, hanno, who, lived, sometime, in, the, 5th, century, bc, claims, that, he, founded, settlements, along, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, possibly, including, the, western, sahara, the, identification, of, the, places, discussed, is, controversial, and,

the, red, sea, the, carthaginians, explored, the, atlantic, coast, of, the, desert, but, the, turbulence, of, the, waters, and, the, lack, of, markets, caused, a, lack, of, presence, further, south, than, modern, morocco, centralized, states, thus, surrounded, the, desert, on, the, north, and, east, it, remained, outside, the, control, of, these, states, raids, from, the, nomadic, berber, people, of, the, desert, were, of, constant, concern, to, those, living, on, the, edge, of, the, desert, an, urban, civilization, the, garamantes, arose, around, 500, bce, in, the, sahara, in, a, valley, that, is, now, called, the, wadi, al, ajal, in, fezzan, libya, the, garamantes, built, a, prosperous, empire, in, the, heart, of, the, desert, the, garamantes, achieved, this, development, by, digging, tunnels, far, into, the, mountains, flanking, the, valley, to, tap, fossil, water, and, bring, it, to, their, fields, the, garamantes, grew, populous, and, strong, conquering, their, neighbors, and, capturing, and, enslaving, many, individuals, who, were, forced, to, work, by, extending, the, tunnels, the, ancient, greeks, and, the, romans, knew, of, the, garamantes, and, regarded, them, as, uncivilized, nomads, however, they, traded, with, them, and, a, roman, bath, has, been, found, in, the, garamantes, capital, of, garama, archaeologists, have, found, eight, major, towns, and, many, other, important, settlements, in, the, garamantes, territory, the, garamantes, civilization, eventually, collapsed, after, they, had, depleted, available, water, in, the, aquifers, and, could, no, longer, sustain, the, effort, to, extend, the, tunnels, further, into, the, mountains, between, the, first, century, bce, and, the, fourth, century, ce, several, roman, expeditions,
