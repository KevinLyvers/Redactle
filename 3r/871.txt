failed, to, establish, trading, relationships, with, the, chinese, the, portuguese, focused, on, trade, with, japan, the, roman, catholic, diocese, of, macau, was, created, in, 1576, and, by, 1583, the, municipal, council, of, macau, had, been, established, to, handle, municipal, affairs, for, the, growing, settlement, macau, was, at, the, peak, of, its, prosperity, as, a, major, warehouse,

city, in, the, 1622, battle, of, macau, but, were, repelled, successfully, by, the, portuguese, macau, entered, a, period, of, decline, in, the, 1640s, following, a, series, of, catastrophic, events, for, the, burgeoning, colony, portuguese, access, to, trade, routes, was, irreparably, severed, when, japan, halted, trade, in, 1639, and, after, the, portuguese, restoration, war, of, 1640, portuguese, malacca, fell, to, the, dutch, in, 1641, maritime, trade, with, china, was, banned, in, 1644, following, the, qing, conquest, under, the, haijin, policies, it, was, limited, only, to,

trade, decades, later, under, the, canton, system, in, 1757, foreign, ships, were, required, to, stop, first, at, macau, before, further, proceeding, to, canton, qing, authorities, exercised, a, much, greater, role, in, governing, the, territory, during, this, period, chinese, residents, were, subject, to, qing, courts, and, new, construction, had, to, be, approved, by, the, resident, mandarin, beginning, in, the, 1740s, as, the, opium, trade, became, more, lucrative, during, the, 18th, century, macau, again, became, an, important, stopping, point, en, route, to, china, following, the, first, opium, war, and, the, establishment, of, hong, kong, by, the, british, macau, lost, its, role, as, a, major, port, firecracker, and, incense, production, as, well, as, tea, and, tobacco, processing, were, vital, industries, in, the, colony, during, this, time, portugal, was, able, to, capitalise, on, china, s, postwar, weakness, and, assert, its, sovereignty, the, governor, of, macau, began, refusing, to, pay, china, annual, land, rent, for, the, colony, in, the, 1840s, and, annexed, taipa, and, coloane, in, 1851, and, 1864, respectively, portugal, also, occupied, nearby, lapa, and, montanha, but, these, were, returned, to, china, by, 1887, when, perpetual, occupation, rights, over, macau, were, formalised, in, the, sino, portuguese, treaty, of, peking, this, agreement, also, prohibited, portugal, from, ceding, macau, without, chinese, approval, despite, occasional, conflict, between, cantonese, authorities, and, the, colonial, government, macau, s, status, remained, unchanged, through, the, republican, revolutions, of, both, portugal, in, 1910, and, china, in, 1911, the, kuomintang, further, affirmed, portuguese, jurisdiction, in, macau, when, the, treaty, of, peking, was, renegotiated, in, 1928, during, the, second, world, war, the, empire, of, japan, did, not, occupy, the, colony, and, generally, respected, portuguese, neutrality, in, macau, however, after, japanese, troops, captured, a, british, cargo, ship, in, macau, waters, in, 1943, japan, installed, a, group, of, government, advisors, as, an, alternative, to, military, occupation, the, territory, largely, avoided, military, action, during, the, war, except, in, 1945, when, the, united, states, ordered, air, raids, on, macau, after, learning, that, the, colonial, government, was, preparing, to, sell, aviation, fuel, to, japan, in, 1950, the, us, paid, portugal, more, than, us, 20, million, in, compensation, for, the, damage, during, the, war, refugees, from, mainland, china, swelled, the, population, as, they, fled, from, the, chinese, civil, war, access, to, a, large, workforce, enabled, macau, s, economy, to, grow, as, the, colony, expanded, its, clothing, and, textiles, manufacturing, industry, developed, its, tourism, industry, and, legalised, casino, gaming, however, at, the, height, of, the, cultural, revolution, residents, dissatisfied, with, the, colonial, administration, rioted, in, the, 1966, 12, 3, incident, in, which, 8, people, were, killed, and, more, than, 200, were, injured, portugal, lost, full, control, over, the, colony, afterwards, and, agreed, to, cooperate, with, the, chinese, communist, party, in, exchange, for, continued, administration, of, macau, following, the, 1974, carnation, revolution, portugal, formally, relinquished, macau, as, an, overseas, province, and, acknowledged, it, as, a, chinese, territory, under, portuguese, administration, after, china, first, concluded, arrangements, on, hong, kong, s, future, with, the, united, kingdom, it, entered, negotiations, with, portugal, over, macau, in, 1986, these, concluded, with, the, signing, of, the, 1987, joint, declaration, on, the, question, of, macau, in, which, portugal, agreed, the, handover, of, the, colony, in, 1999, and, china, guaranteed, macau, s, political, and, economic, systems, for, 50, years, after, the, handover, in, the,

growth, rate, from, 2002, to, 2014, making, macau, one, of, the, richest, economies, in, the, world, on, a, per, capita, basis, political, debates, have, centred, on, the, region, s, jurisdictional, independence, and, the, central, government, s, adherence, of, one, country, two, systems, while, issues, such, as, national, security, legislation, have, been, controversial, macanese, residents, generally, have, high, levels, of, trust, in, the, government, kwong, and, wong, explain, this, by, comparing, macau, to, hong, kong, the, case, of, macau, shows, that, the, very, small, size, of, a, microstate, helps, central, authorities, to, exercise, political, control, stifle, political, pluralism, and, monopolize, opinions, all, of, which, strengthen, regime, persistence, macau, is, a,
