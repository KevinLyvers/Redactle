hudson, bay, sometimes, called, hudson, s, bay, usually, historically, is, a, large, body, of, saltwater, in, northeastern, canada, with, a, surface, area, of, 1, 230, 000, km, 2, 470, 000, sq, mi, it, is, located, north, of, ontario, west, of, quebec, northeast, of, manitoba, and, southeast, of, nunavut, but, politically, entirely, part, of, nunavut, it, is, an, inland, marginal, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, the, hudson, strait, provides, a, connection, between, the, labrador, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, northeast, while, the, foxe, channel, connects, the, hudson, bay, with, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, north, the, hudson, bay, drainage, basin, drains, a, very, large, area, about, 3, 861, 400, km, 2, 1, 490, 900, sq, mi, that, includes, parts, of, southeastern, nunavut, alberta, saskatchewan, ontario, quebec, all, of, manitoba, and, parts, of, the, u, s, states, of, north, dakota, south, dakota, minnesota, and, montana, hudson, bay, s, southern, arm, is, called, james, bay, the, eastern, cree, name, for, hudson, and, james, bay, is, w, nipekw, southern, dialect, or, w, nip, kw, northern, dialect, meaning, muddy, or, brackish, water, lake, winnipeg, is, similarly, named, by, the, local, cree, as, is, the, location, for, the, city, of, winnipeg, the, bay, is, named, after, henry, hudson, an, englishman, sailing, for, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, after, whom, the, river, that, he, explored, in, 1609, is, also, named, hudson, bay, encompasses, 1, 230, 000, km, 2, 470, 000, sq, mi, making, it, the, second, largest, water, body, using, the, term, bay, in, the, world, after, the, bay, of, bengal, the, bay, is, relatively, shallow, and, is, considered, an, epicontinental, sea, with, an, average, depth, of, about, 100, m, 330, ft, compared, to, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, in, the, bay, of, bengal, it, is, about, 1, 370, km, 850, mi, long, and, 1, 050, km, 650, mi, wide, on, the, east, it, is, connected, with, the, arctic, ocean, davis, strait, by, hudson, strait, on, the, north, with, the, arctic, ocean, by, foxe, basin, which, is, not, considered, part, of, the, bay, and, fury, and, hecla, strait, hudson, bay, is, often, considered, part, of, the, arctic, ocean, the, international, hydrographic, organization, in, its, 2002, working, draft, of, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, defined, hudson, bay, with, its, outlet, extending, from, 62, 5, to, 66, 5, degrees, north, just, a, few, miles, south, of, the, arctic, circle, as, being, part, of, the, arctic, ocean, specifically, arctic, ocean, subdivision, 9, 11, other, authorities, include, it, in, the, atlantic, in, part, because, of, its, greater, water, budget, connection, with, that, ocean, the, search, for, a, western, route, to, cathay, and, the, east, indies, which, had, been, actively, pursued, since, the, days, of, christopher, columbus, and, john, cabot, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 15th, century, directly, resulted, in, the, first, sighting, of, hudson, bay, by, europeans, english, explorers, and, colonists, named, hudson, bay, after, sir, henry, hudson, who, explored, the, bay, beginning, 2, august, 1610, on, his, ship, discovery, 170, on, his, fourth, voyage, to, north, america, hudson, worked, his, way, around, greenland, s, west, coast, and, into, the, bay, mapping, much, of, its, eastern, coast, discovery, became, trapped, in, the, ice, over, the, winter, and, the, crew, survived, onshore, at, the, southern, tip, of, james, bay, in, the, spring, as, the, ice, receded, henry, hudson, expressed, a, desire, to, continue, exploring, the, uncharted, region, however, on, 22, june, 1611, the, crew, mutinied, they, left, hudson, and, others, adrift, in, a, small, boat, the, fate, of, hudson, and, the, other, men, stranded, with, him, remains, undetermined, nevertheless, there, is, little, evidence, in, historical, documents, to, suggest, that, they, persisted, for, a, long, time, thereafter, 185, in, may, 1612, sir, thomas, button, sailed, from, england, with, two, ships, to, look, for, henry, hudson, and, to, continue, the, search, for, the, northwest, passage, to, asia, in, 1668, nonsuch, reached, the, bay, and, traded, for, beaver, pelts, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, hudson, s, bay, company, hbc, which, still, bears, the, historic, name, the, hbc, negotiated, a, trading, monopoly, from, the, english, crown, for, the, hudson, bay, watershed, called, rupert, s, land, 4, in, 1670, the, english, crown, granted, a, charter, to, facilitate, fur, trading, within, the, hudson, bay, drainage, basin, france, contested, this, grant, by, sending, several, military, expeditions, to, the, region, but, abandoned, its, claim, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, april, 1713, the, treaty, of, utrecht, signed, on, 11, april, 1713, marked, a, significant, agreement, between, britain, and, france, the, treaty, was, negotiated, in, utrecht, netherlands, and, marked, a, crucial, stage, in, the, conclusion, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, its, provisions, had, a, significant, impact, in, shaping, the, postwar, landscape, and, establishing, a, new, order, in, both, europe, and, north, america, french, concessions, in, north, america, as, outlined, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, included, hudson, bay, region, nova, scotia, and, newfoundland, during, this, period, the, hbc, built, several, factories, forts, and, trading, posts, along, the, coast, at, the, mouth, of, the, major, rivers, such, as, fort, severn, york, factory, churchill, and, the, prince, of, wales, fort, the, strategic, locations, were, bases, for, inland, exploration, more, importantly, they, were, trading, posts, with, indigenous, peoples, who, came, to, them, with, furs, from, their, trapping, season, the, hbc, shipped, the, furs, to, europe, and, continued, to, use, some, of, these, posts, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, hbc, s, trade, monopoly, was, abolished, in, 1870, by, a, british, order, in, council, called, the, deed, of, surrender, ceded, rupert, s, land, to, canada, an, area, of, approximately, 3, 900, 000, km, 2, 1, 500, 000, sq, mi, as, part, of, the, northwest, territories, 427, in, 1912, the, western, shore, south, of, 60, and, following, the, quebec, boundaries, extension, act, 1912, all, the, eastern, shore, were, transferred, to, the, adjacent, provinces, but, the, bay, and, offshore, islands, remained, part, of, the, northwest, territories, starting, in, 1913, the, bay, was, extensively, charted, by, the, canadian, government, s, css, acadia, to, develop, it, for, navigation, this, mapping, progress, led, to, the, establishment, of, churchill, manitoba, as, a, deep, sea, port, for, wheat, exports, in, 1929, after, unsuccessful, attempts, at, port, nelson, the, port, of, churchill, was, an, important, shipping, link, for, trade, with, europe, and, russia, until, its, closure, in, 2016, by, owner, omnitrax, the, port, and, the, hudson, bay, railway, were, then, sold, to, the, arctic, gateway, group, a, consortium, of, first, nations, local, governments, and, corporate, investors, in, 2018, on, 9, july, 2019, ships, resupplying, arctic, communities, began, stopping, at, the, port, for, additional, cargo, and, the, port, began, shipping, grain, again, on, 7, september, 2019, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, northern, limit, of, hudson, bay, as, follows, a, line, from, nuvuk, point, 62, 21, n, 78, 06, w, 62, 350, n, 78, 100, w, 62, 350, 78, 100, to, leyson, point, the, southeastern, extreme, of, southampton, island, through, the, southern, and, western, shores, of, southampton, island, to, its, northern, extremity, thence, a, line, to, beach, point, 66, 03, n, 86, 06, w, 66, 050, n, 86, 100, w, 66, 050,

going, farther, south, towards, quebec, where, inukjuak, is, still, dominated, by, the, tundra, from, arviat, nunavut, to, the, west, to, the, south, and, southeast, prevails, the, subarctic, climate, k, ppen, dfc, this, is, because, in, the, central, summer, months, heat, waves, can, advance, from, the, hot, land, and, make, the, weather, milder, with, the, result, that, the, average, temperature, surpasses, 10, c, 50, f, the, bay, receives, water, from, various, surrounding, rivers, and, currents, originating, from, the, foxe, basin, in, the, north, resulting, in, a, counterclockwise, overall, flow, at, the, extreme, southern, tip, of, the, extension, known, as, james, bay, arises, a, humid, continental, climate, with, a, longer, and, generally, hotter, summer, k, ppen, dfb, the, average, annual, temperature, in, almost, the, entire, bay, is, around, 0, c, 32, f, or, below, in, the, extreme, northeast, winter, temperatures, average, as, low, as, 29, c, 20, f, the, hudson, bay, region, has, very, low, year, round, average, temperatures, the, average, annual, temperature, for, churchill, at, 59, n, is, 6, c, 21, f, and, inukjuak, facing, cool, westerlies, in, summer, at, 58, n, an,

46, f, water, temperature, peaks, at, 8, 9, c, 46, 48, f, on, the, western, side, of, the, bay, in, late, summer, it, is, largely, frozen, over, from, mid, december, to, mid, june, when, it, usually, clears, from, its, eastern, end, westwards, and, southwards, a, steady, increase, in, regional, temperatures, over, the, last, 100, years, has, led, to, decreases, in, the, extent, of, the, sea, ice, in, hudson, bay, by, 19, 5, per, decade, as, well, as, a, lengthening, of, the, ice, free, period, which, was, as, short, as, four, months, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, polar, climate, of, hudson, bay, means, it, is, home, for, a, variety, of, polar, climate, animals, in, the, western, hudson, bay, whb, beluga, whale, population, is, the, most, significant, known, group, in, the, canadian, arctic, estimated, to, consist, of, approximately, 54, 473, individuals, hudson, bay, has, a, lower, average, salinity, level, than, that, of, ocean, water, the, main, causes, are, the, low, rate, of, evaporation, the, bay, is, ice, covered, for, much, of, the, year, the, large, volume, of, terrestrial, runoff, entering, the, bay, about, 700, km, 3, 170, cu, mi, annually, the, hudson, bay, watershed, covering, much, of, canada, many, rivers, and, streams, discharging, into, the, bay, and, the, limited, connection, with, the, atlantic, ocean, and, its, higher, salinity, sea, ice, is, about, three, times, the, annual, river, flow, into, the, bay, and, its, annual, freezing, and, thawing, significantly, alters, the, salinity, of, the, surface, layer, although, its, exact, effects, are, not, fully, understood, currently, the, cyclonic, storms, in, the, bay, are, responsible, for, synoptic, variability, of, salinity, along, the, coast, one, consequence, of, the, lower, salinity, of, the, bay, is, that, the, freezing, point, of, the, water, is, higher, than, in, the, rest, of, the, world, s, oceans, thus, decreasing, the, time, that, the, bay, remains, ice, free, the, increase, of, river, inflows, during, the, winter, has, decreased, the, season, of, sea, ice, by, more, than, one, month, since, the, 1960s, the, lower, salinity, of, the, bay, also, has, effects, on, the, distribution, and, prevalence, of, common, marine, life, such, as, micro, algae, research, has, shown, that, the, lower, salinity, of, the, hudson, bay, limits, the, growth, of, micro, algae, which, causes, a, notable, change, in, biomass, along, the, bay, s, salinity, gradient, the, western, shores, of, the, bay, are, a, lowland, known, as, the, hudson, bay, lowlands, covering, 370, 000, km, 2, 140, 000, sq, mi, and, are, canada, s, largest, continuous, peatland, much, of, the, landform, has, been, shaped, by, the, actions, of, glaciers, and, the, shrinkage, of, the, bay, over, long, periods, of, time, the, coastal, area, located, in, a, region, characterized, by, permanently, frozen, layers, of, soil, known, as, permafrost, is, a, low, lying, wetland, that, receives, water, from, lakes, and, fast, flowing, rivers, signs, of, numerous, former, beachfronts, can, be, seen, far, inland, from, the, current, shore, a, large, portion, of, the, lowlands, in, the, province, of, ontario, is, part, of, the, polar, bear, provincial, park, and, a, similar, portion, of, the, lowlands, in, manitoba, is, contained, in, wapusk, national, park, the, latter, location, being, a, significant, maternity, denning, area, for, polar, bears, in, contrast, most, of, the, eastern, shores, the, quebec, portion, form, the, western, edge, of, the, canadian, shield, in, quebec, the, area, is, rocky, and, hilly, its, vegetation, is, typically, boreal, forest, the, northern, shores, are, tundra, measured, by, shoreline, hudson, bay, is, the, largest, bay, in, the, world, the, largest, in, area, being, the, bay, of, bengal, the, distinctive, arculate, segment, on, the, eastern, shore, of, hudson, bay, is, referred, to, as, the, nastapoka, arc, there, are, many, islands, in, hudson, bay, mostly, near, the, eastern, coast, all, the, islands, including, those, in, james, bay, are, part, of, nunavut, and, lie, in, the, arctic, archipelago, several, are, disputed, by, the, cree, one, group, of, islands, is, the, belcher, islands, the, belcher, islands, are, located, in, the, centre, of, the, nastapoka, arc, another, group, includes, the, ottawa, islands, which, are, located, near, the, eastern, shore, of, the, hudson, bay, hudson, bay, occupies, a, large, structural, basin, known, as, the, hudson, bay, basin, that, lies, within, the, canadian, shield, the, collection, and, interpretation, of, outcrop, seismic, and, drillhole, data, for, exploration, for, oil, and, gas, reservoirs, within, the, hudson, bay, basin, found, that, it, is, filled, by, at, most, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, of, ordovician, to, devonian, limestone, dolomites, evaporites, black, shales, and, various, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, that, overlie, less, than, 60, m, 200, ft, of, cambrian, strata, that, consist, of, unfossiliferous, quartz, sandstones, and, conglomerates, overlain, by, sandy, and, stromatolitic, dolomites, in, addition, a, minor, amount, of, terrestrial, fluvial, sands, and, gravels, of, the, cretaceous, period, are, preserved, in, the, fill, of, a, prominent, ring, like, depression, about, 325, 650, km, 202, 404, mi, across, created, by, the, dissolution, of, silurian, evaporites, during, the, cretaceous, period, from, the, large, quantity, of, published, geologic, data, that, has, been, collected, as, the, result, of, hydrocarbon, exploration, academic, research, and, related, geologic, mapping, a, detailed, history, of, the, hudson, bay, basin, has, been, reconstructed, during, the, majority, of, the, cambrian, period, this, basin, did, not, exist, rather, this, part, of, the, canadian, shield, area, was, still, topographically, high, and, emergent, it, was, only, during, the, later, part, of, the, cambrian, that, the, rising, sea, level, of, the, sauk, marine, transgression, slowly, submerged, it, during, the, ordovician, this, part, of, the, canadian, shield, continued, to, be, submerged, by, rising, sea, levels, except, for, a, brief, middle, ordovician, marine, regression, only, starting, in, the, late, ordovician, and, continuing, into, the, silurian, did, the, gradual, regional, subsidence, of, this, part, of, the, canadian, shield, form, the, hudson, bay, basin, the, formation, of, this, basin, resulted, in, the, accumulation, of, black, bituminous, oil, shale, and, evaporite, deposits, within, its, centre, thick, basin, margin, limestone, and, dolomite, and, the, development, of, extensive, reefs, that, ringed, the, basin, margins, that, were, tectonically, uplifted, as, the, basin, subsided, during, middle, silurian, times, subsidence, ceased, and, this, basin, was, uplifted, it, generated, an, emergent, arch, on, which, reefs, grew, that, divided, the, basin, into, eastern, and, western, sub, basins, during, the, devonian, period, this, basin, filled, with, terrestrial, red, beds, that, interfinger, with, marine, limestone, and, dolomites, before, deposition, was, terminated, by, marine, regression, upper, devonian, black, bituminous, shale, accumulated, in, the, south, east, of, the, basin, the, remaining, history, of, the, hudson, bay, basin, is, largely, unknown, as, a, major, unconformity, separates, upper, devonian, strata, from, glacial, deposits, of, the, pleistocene, except, for, poorly, known, terrestrial, cretaceous, fluvial, sands, and, gravels, that, are, preserved, as, the, fills, of, a, ring, of, subsided, strata, around, the, centre, of, this, basin, strata, representing, this, period, of, time, are, absent, from, the, hudson, bay, basin, and, the, surrounding, canadian, shield, the, precambrian, shield, underlying, hudson, bay, and, in, which, hudson, bay, basin, formed, is, composed, of, two, archean, proto, continents, the, western, churchill, and, superior, cratons, these, cratons, are, separated, by, a, tectonic, collage, that, forms, a, suture, zone, between, these, cratons, and, the, trans, hudson, orogen, the, western, churchill, and, superior, cratons, collided, at, about, 1, 9, 1, 8, ga, in, the, trans, hudson, orogeny, because, of, the, irregular, shapes, of, the, colliding, cratons, this, collision, trapped, between, them, large, fragments, of, juvenile, crust, a, sizable, microcontinent, and, island, arc, terranes, beneath, what, is, now, the, centre, of, modern, hudson, bay, as, part, of, the, trans, hudson, orogen, the, belcher, islands, are, the, eroded, surface, of, the, belcher, fold, belt, which, formed, as, a, result, of, the, tectonic, compression, and, folding, of, sediments, that, accumulated, along, the, margin, of, the, superior, craton, before, its, collision, with, the, western, churchill, craton, hudson, bay, and, the, associated, structural, basin, lie, within, the, centre, of, a, large, free, air, gravity, anomaly, that, lies, within, the, canadian, shield, the, similarity, in, areal, extent, of, the, free, air, gravity, anomaly, with, the, perimeter, of, the, former, laurentide, ice, sheet, that, covered, this, part, of, laurentia, led, to, a, long, held, conclusion, that, this, perturbation, in, the, earth, s, gravity, reflected, still, ongoing, glacial, isostatic, adjustment, to, the, melting, and, disappearance, of, this, ice, sheet, data, collected, over, canada, by, the, gravity, recovery, and, climate, experiment, grace, satellite, mission, allowed, geophysicists, to, isolate, the, gravity, signal, associated, with, glacial, isostatic, adjustment, from, longer, time, scale, process, of, mantle, convection, occurring, beneath, the, canadian, shield, based, upon, this, data, geophysicists, and, other, earth, scientists, concluded, that, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, was, composed, of, two, large, domes, to, the, west, and, east, of, hudson, bay, modelling, glacial, isostatic, adjustment, using, the, grace, data, they, concluded, that, 25, to, 45, of, the, observed, free, air, gravity, anomaly, was, due, to, ongoing, glacial, isostatic, adjustment, and, the, remainder, likely, represents, longer, time, scale, effects, of, mantle, convection, earth, scientists, have, disagreed, about, what, created, the, semicircular, feature, known, as, the, nastapoka, arc, that, forms, a, section, of, the, shoreline, of, southeastern, hudson, bay, the, nastapoka, arc, forms, a, 155, degree, curve, and, appears, to, be, very, circular, noting, the, paucity, of, impact, structures, on, earth, in, relation, to, the, moon, and, mars, carlyle, s, beals, proposed, that, it, is, possibly, part, of, a, precambrian, extraterrestrial, impact, structure, that, is, comparable, in, size, to, the, mare, crisium, on, the, moon, in, the, same, volume, john, tuzo, wilson, commented, on, beals, interpretation, and, alternately, proposed, that, the, nastapoka, arc, may, have, formed, as, part, of, an, extensive, precambrian, continental, collisional, orogen, linked, to, the, closure, of, an, ancient, ocean, basin, the, current, general, consensus, is, that, it, is, an, arcuate, boundary, of, tectonic, origin, between, the, belcher, fold, belt, and, undeformed, basement, of, the, superior, craton, created, during, the, trans, hudson, orogeny, this, is, because, no, credible, evidence, for, such, an, impact, structure, has, been, found, by, regional, magnetic, bouguer, gravity, or, other, geologic, studies, however, other, earth, scientists, have, proposed, that, the, evidence, of, an, archean, impact, might, have, been, masked, by, deformation, accompanying, the, later, formation, of, the, trans, hudson, orogen, and, regard, an, impact, origin, as, a, plausible, possibility, the, longer, periods, of, ice, free, navigation, and, the, reduction, of, arctic, ocean, ice, coverage, have, led, to, russian, and, canadian, interest, in, the, potential, for, commercial, trade, routes, across, the, arctic, and, into, hudson, bay, the, so, called, arctic, bridge, would, link, churchill, manitoba, and, the, russian, port, of, murmansk, the, increase, in, ships, traversing, the, proposed, arctic, bridge, will, result, in, an, increase, in, accidents, that, will, release, pollutants, into, the, environment, due, to, the, freezing, of, the, water, in, the, winter, cleanup, will, be, harder, and, with, a, shorter, window, of, time, the, biggest, port, in, the, hudson, bay, is, the, city, of, churchill, which, lies, on, the, river, with, the, same, name, churchill, river, the, port, of, churchill, is, a, privately, owned, port, on, hudson, bay, in, churchill, manitoba, canada, routes, from, the, port, connect, to, the, north, atlantic, through, the, hudson, strait, as, of, 2008, the, port, had, four, deep, sea, berths, capable, of, handling, panamax, size, vessels, for, the, loading, and, unloading, of, grain, bulk, commodities, general, cargo, and, tanker, vessels, the, port, is, connected, to, the, hudson, bay, railway, which, shares, the, same, parent, company, and, cargo, connections, are, made, with, the, canadian, national, railway, system, at, hbr, s, southern, terminus, in, the, pas, it, is, the, only, port, of, its, size, and, scope, in, canada, that, does, not, connect, directly, to, the, country, s, road, system, all, goods, shipped, overland, to, and, from, the, port, must, travel, by, rail, the, port, was, originally, owned, by, the, government, of, canada, but, was, sold, in, 1997, to, the, american, company, omnitrax, to, run, privately, in, december, 2015, omnitrax, announced, it, was, negotiating, a, sale, of, the, port, and, the, associated, hudson, bay, railway, to, a, group, of, first, nations, based, in, northern, manitoba, with, no, sale, finalized, by, july, 2016, omnitrax, shut, down, the, port, and, the, major, railroad, freight, operations, in, august, 2016, the, railway, continued, to, carry, cargo, to, supply, the, town, of, churchill, itself, until, the, line, was, damaged, by, flooding, on, 23, may, 2017, the, port, and, the, hudson, bay, railway, were, sold, to, arctic, gateway, group, a, consortium, of, first, nations, local, governments, and, corporate, investors, in, 2018, on, 9, july,
