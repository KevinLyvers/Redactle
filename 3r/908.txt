inscription, evidence, from, the, famed, ashoka, edicts, containing, allahabad, pillar, also, referred, to, as, the, prayaga, bull, pillar, adds, to, the, confusion, about, the, antiquity, of, this, city, excavations, have, revealed, northern, black, polished, ware, dating, to, 600, 700, bce, according, to, dilip, kumar, chakrabarti, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, that, modern, prayag, i, e, modern, allahabad, was, an, ancient, city, yet, it, is, inconceivable, that, one, of, the, holiest, places, of, hinduism, prayag, or, the, confluence, of, the, ganga, and, yamuna, should, be, without, a, major, ancient, city, chakrabarti, suggests, that, the, city, of, jhusi, opposite, the, confluence, must, have, been, the, ancient, settlement, of, prayag, archaeological, surveys, since, the, 1950s, has, revealed, the, presence, of, human, settlements, near, the, sangam, since, c, 800, bce, along, with, ashoka, s, brahmi, script, inscription, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, pillar, has, a, samudragupta, inscription, as, well, as, a, magha, mela, inscription, of, birbal, of, akbar, s, era, it, states, in, the, samvat, year, 1632, saka, 1493, in, magha, the, 5th, of, the, waning, moon, on, monday, gangadas, s, son, maharaja, birbal, made, the, auspicious, pilgrimage, to, tirth, raj, prayag, saphal, scripsit, translated, by, alexander, cunningham, 1879, these, dates, correspond, to, about, 1575, ce, and, confirm, the, importance, and, the, name, prayag, according, to, cunningham, this, pillar, was, brought, to, allahabad, from, kaushambi, by, a, muslim, sultan, and, that, in, some, later, century, before, akbar, the, old, city, of, prayag, had, been, deserted, other, scholars, such, as, krishnaswamy, and, ghosh, disagree, in, a, paper, published, in, 1935, they, state, that, the, pillar, was, always, at, its, current, location, based, on, the, inscription, dates, on, the, pillar, lack, of, textual, evidence, for, the, move, in, records, left, by, muslim, historians, and, the, difficulty, in, moving, the, massive, pillar, further, like, cunningham, they, noted, that, many, smaller, inscriptions, were, added, on, the, pillar, over, time, quite, many, of, these, inscriptions, include, a, date, between, 1319, ce, and, 1575, ce, and, most, of, these, refer, to, the, month, magha, according, to, krishnaswamy, and, ghosh, these, dates, are, likely, related, to, the, magh, mela, pilgrimage, at, prayag, as, recommended, in, the, ancient, hindu, texts, in, papers, published, about, 1979, john, irwin, a, scholar, of, indian, art, history, and, archaeology, concurred, with, krishnaswamy, and, ghosh, that, the, allahabad, pillar, was, never, moved, and, was, always, at, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, ganges, and, yamuna, according, to, irwin, an, analysis, of, the, minor, inscriptions, and, ancient, scribblings, on, the, pillar, first, observed, by, cunningham, also, noted, by, krishnaswamy, and, ghosh, reveals, that, these, included, years, and, months, and, the, latter, always, turns, out, to, be, magha, which, also, gives, it, name, to, the, magh, mela, the, prayaga, bathing, pilgrimage, festival, of, the, hindus, he, further, stated, that, the, pillar, origins, were, undoubtedly, pre, ashokan, based, on, the, new, evidence, from, the, archaeological, and, geological, surveys, of, the, triveni, site, prayaga, the, major, and, minor, inscriptions, as, well, as, textual, evidence, taken, together, archaeological, and, geological, surveys, done, since, the, 1950s, states, irwin, have, revealed, that, the, rivers, particularly, ganges, had, a, different, course, in, distant, past, than, now, the, original, path, of, river, ganges, at, the, prayaga, confluence, had, settlements, dating, from, the, 8th, century, bce, onwards, according, to, karel, werner, an, indologist, known, for, his, studies, on, religion, particularly, buddhism, the, irwin, papers, showed, conclusively, that, the, pillar, did, not, originate, at, kaushambi, but, had, been, at, prayaga, from, pre, buddhist, times, the, 7th, century, buddhist, chinese, traveller, xuanzang, hiuen, tsang, in, fascicle, v, of, d, t, ng, x, y, j, great, tang, records, on, the, western, regions, explicitly, mentions, prayaga, as, both, a, country, and, a, great, city, where, the, yamuna, river, meets, ganges, river, he, states, that, the, great, city, has, hundreds, of, deva, temples, and, to, the, south, of, the, city, are, two, buddhist, institutions, a, stupa, built, by, ashoka, and, a, monastery, his, 644, ce, memoir, also, mentions, the, hindu, bathing, rituals, at, the, junction, of, the, rivers, where, people, fast, near, it, and, then, bathe, believing, that, this, washes, away, their, sins, wealthy, people, and, kings, come, to, this, great, city, to, give, away, alms, at, the, grand, place, of, almsgiving, according, to, xuanzang, s, travelogue, the, confluence, is, to, the, east, of, this, great, city, and, the, site, where, alms, are, distributed, every, day, kama, maclean, an, indologist, who, has, published, articles, on, the, kumbh, mela, predominantly, based, on, the, colonial, archives, and, english, language, media, states, based, on, emails, from, other, scholars, and, a, more, recent, interpretation, of, the, 7th, century, xuanzang, memoir, that, prayag, was, also, an, important, site, in, 7th, century, india, of, a, buddhist, festival, she, states, that, xuanzang, festivities, at, prayag, featured, a, buddha, statue, and, involved, alms, giving, consistent, with, buddhist, practices, according, to, li, rongxi, a, scholar, credited, with, a, recent, and, complete, translation, of, a, critical, version, of, the, d, t, ng, x, y, j, xuanzang, mentions, that, the, site, of, the, alms, giving, is, a, deva, temple, and, the, alms, giving, practice, is, recommended, by, the, records, at, this, temple, rongxi, adds, that, the, population, of, prayaga, was, predominantly, heretics, non, buddhists, hindus, and, affirms, that, prayaga, attracted, festivities, of, deva, worshipping, heretics, and, also, the, orthodox, buddhists, xuanzang, also, describes, a, ritual, suicide, practice, at, prayaga, then, concludes, it, is, absurd, he, mentions, a, tree, with, evil, spirits, that, stands, before, another, deva, temple, people, commit, suicide, by, jumping, from, it, in, the, belief, that, they, will, go, to, heaven, according, to, ariel, glucklich, a, scholar, of, hinduism, and, anthropology, of, religion, the, xuanzang, memoir, mentions, both, the, superstitious, devotional, suicide, and, narrates, a, story, of, how, a, brahmin, of, a, more, ancient, era, tried, to, put, an, end, to, this, practice, alexander, cunningham, believed, the, tree, described, by, xuanzang, was, the, akshayavat, tree, it, still, existed, at, the, time, of, al, biruni, who, calls, it, as, prayaga, located, at, the, confluence, of, ganga, and, yamuna, the, historic, literature, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, before, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, use, the, term, prayag, and, never, use, the, term, allahabad, or, its, variants, its, history, before, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, is, unclear, in, contrast, to, the, account, of, xuanzang, the, muslim, historians, place, the, tree, at, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, the, historian, dr, d, b, dubey, states, that, it, appears, that, between, this, period, the, sandy, plain, was, washed, away, by, the, ganges, to, an, extent, that, the, temple, and, tree, seen, by, the, chinese, traveller, too, was, washed, away, with, the, river, later, changing, its, course, to, the, east, and, the, confluence, shifting, to, the, place, where, akbar, laid, the, foundations, of, his, fort, henry, miers, elliot, believed, that, a, town, existed, before, allahabad, was, founded, he, adds, that, after, mahmud, of, ghazni, captured, asn, near, fatehpur, he, couldn, t, have, crossed, into, bundelkhand, without, visiting, allahabad, had, there, been, a, city, worth, plundering, he, further, adds, that, its, capture, should, have, been, heard, when, muhammad, of, ghor, captured, benares, however, ghori, s, historians, never, noticed, it, akbarnama, mentions, that, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, founded, a, great, city, in, allahabad, abd, al, qadir, bada, uni, and, nizamuddin, ahmad, mention, that, akbar, laid, the, foundations, of, an, imperial, city, there, which, he, called, ilahabas, abul, fazal, in, his, ain, i, akbari, states, for, a, long, time, his, akbar, s, desire, was, to, found, a, great, city, in, the, town, of, piyag, allahabad, where, the, rivers, ganges, and, jamuna, join, on, 13th, november, 1583, 1st, azar, 991, h, he, akbar, reached, the, wished, spot, and, laid, the, foundations, of, the, city, and, planned, four, forts, abul, fazal, adds, ilahabad, anciently, called, prayag, was, distinguished, by, his, imperial, majesty, by, the, former, name, the, role, of, akbar, in, founding, the, ilahabad, later, called, allahabad, fort, and, city, is, mentioned, by, abd, al, qadir, badayuni, as, well, nizamuddin, ahmad, gives, two, different, dates, for, allahabad, s, foundation, in, different, sections, of, tabaqat, i, akbari, he, states, that, akbar, laid, the, foundation, of, the, city, at, a, place, of, the, confluence, of, ganges, and, jumna, which, was, a, very, sacred, site, of, hindus, then, gives, 1574, and, 1584, as, the, year, of, its, founding, and, that, it, was, named, ilahabas, the, next, generation, of, mughal, rulers, started, calling, it, illahabad, and, finally, the, british, started, calling, it, allahabad, for, ease, of, pronunciation, akbar, was, impressed, by, its, strategic, location, for, a, fort, according, to, william, pinch, akbar, s, motive, may, have, been, twofold, one, the, armed, fort, secured, the, control, of, fertile, doab, region, second, it, greatly, increased, his, visibility, and, power, to, the, non, muslims, who, gathered, here, for, pilgrimage, from, distant, places, and, who, constituted, the, majority, of, his, subjects, later, he, declared, ilahabas, as, a, capital, of, one, of, the, twelve, divisions, subahs, according, to, richard, burn, the, suffix, bas, was, deemed, to, savouring, too, much, of, hinduism, and, therefore, the, name, was, changed, to, ilahabad, by, shah, jahan, this, evolved, into, the, two, variant, colonial, era, spellings, of, ilahabad, hindi, and, allahabad, according, to, maclean, these, variant, spellings, have, a, political, basis, as, ilaha,
