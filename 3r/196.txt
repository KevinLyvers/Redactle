from, 17, countries, performed, a, relay, swim, across, the, bering, strait, the, first, such, swim, in, history, they, swam, from, cape, dezhnev, russia, to, cape, prince, of, wales, united, states, roughly, 110, kilometers, 68, mi, due, to, the, current, they, had, direct, support, from, the, russian, navy, using, one, of, its, ships, and, assistance, with, permission, a, physical, link, between, asia, and, north, america, via, the, bering, strait, nearly, became, a, reality, in, 1864, when, a, russian, american, telegraph, company, began, preparations, for, an, overland, telegraph, line, connecting, europe, and, america, via, the, east, it, was, abandoned, when, the, undersea, atlantic, cable, proved, successful, a, further, proposal, for, a, bridge, and, tunnel, link, from, eastern, russia, to, alaska, was, made, by, french, engineer, baron, loicq, de, lobel, in, 1906, czar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, issued, an, order, authorising, a, franco, american, syndicate, represented, by, de, lobel, to, begin, work, on, the, trans, siberian, alaska, railroad, project, but, no, physical, work, ever, commenced, suggestions, have, been, made, to, construct, a, bering, strait, bridge, between, alaska, and, siberia, despite, the, unprecedented, engineering, political, and, financial, challenges, russia, green, lit, a, us, 65, billion, tkm, world, link, tunnel, project, in, august, 2011, if, completed, the, 103, kilometer, 64, mi, tunnel, would, be, the, world, s, longest, china, considered, construction, of, a, china, russia, canada, america, railroad, line, that, would, include, construction, of, a, 200, kilometer, long, 120, mi, underwater, tunnel, that, would, cross, the, bering, strait, in, 1956, the, soviet, union, proposed, to, the, us, a, joint, bi, national, project, to, warm, the, arctic, ocean, and, melt, some, of, the, ice, cap, as, designed, by, petr, borisov, the, soviet, project, called, for, a, 90, kilometer, wide, 56, mi, dam, across, the, bering, strait, it, would, block, the, cold, pacific, current, from, entering, the, arctic, by, pumping, low, salinity, cold, surface, water, across, the, dam, to, the, pacific, warmer, and, higher, salinity, sea, water, from, the, atlantic, ocean, would, be, introduced, into, the, arctic, ocean, however, citing, national, security, concerns, the, cia, and, fbi, experts, opposed, the, soviet, plan, by, arguing, that, while, the, plan, was, feasible, it, would, compromise, norad, and, thus, the, dam, could, be, built, at, only, an, immense, cost, soviet, scientist, d, a, drogaytsev, also, opposed, the, idea, stating, that, the, sea, north, of, the, dam, and, north, flowing, rivers, in, siberia, would, become, unnavigable, year, round, and, the, gobi, and, other, deserts, would, be, extended, to, the, northern, siberia, coastline, american, charles, p, steinmetz, 1865, 1923, earlier, proposed, to, widen, the, bering, strait, by, removing, st, lawrence, island, and, parts, of, seward, and, chukotski, peninsulas, a, strait, 320, kilometers, 200, mi, wide, would, let, the, japan, current, melt, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, 21st, century, a, 300, kilometer, 190, mi, dam, has, also, been, proposed, however, the, aim, of, the, proposal, is, to, preserve, the, arctic, ice, cap, against, global, warming, during, the, cold, war, the, bering, strait, marked, the, border, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, the, diomede, islands, big, diomede, russia, and, little, diomede, us, are, only, 3, 8, km, 2, 4, mi, apart, traditionally, the, indigenous, people, in, the, area, had, frequently, crossed, the, border, back, and, forth, for, routine, visits, seasonal, festivals, and, subsistence, trade, but, were, prevented, from, doing, so, during, the, cold, war, the, border, became, known, as, the, ice, curtain, it, was, completely, closed, and, there, was, no, regular, passenger, air, or, boat, traffic, since, 2012, the, russian, coast, of, the, bering, strait, has, been, a, closed, military, zone, through, organized, trips, and, the, use, of, special, permits, it, is, possible, for, foreigners, to, visit, all, arrivals, must, be, through, an, airport, or, a, cruise, port, near, the, bering, strait, only, at, anadyr, or, provideniya, unauthorized, travelers, who, arrive, on, shore, after, crossing, the, strait, even, those, with, visas, may, be, arrested, imprisoned, briefly, fined, deported, and, banned, from, future, visas
