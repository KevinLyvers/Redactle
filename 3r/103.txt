the, great, lakes, french, grands, lacs, also, called, the, great, lakes, of, north, america, are, a, series, of, large, interconnected, freshwater, lakes, spanning, the, canada, united, states, border, the, five, lakes, are, superior, michigan, huron, erie, and, ontario, hydrologically, michigan, and, huron, are, a, single, body, of, water, as, they, are, joined, by, straits, of, mackinac, the, great, lakes, waterway, enables, modern, travel, and, shipping, by, water, among, the, lakes, the, lakes, connect, to, the, atlantic, ocean, via, the, saint, lawrence, river, the, great, lakes, are, the, largest, group, of, freshwater, lakes, on, earth, by, total, area, and, the, second, largest, by, total, volume, they, contain, 21, of, the, world, s, surface, fresh, water, by, volume, the, total, surface, is, 94, 250, square, miles, 244, 106, km, 2, and, the, total, volume, measured, at, the, low, water, datum, is, 5, 439, cubic, miles, 22, 671, km, 3, slightly, less, than, the, volume, of, lake, baikal, 5, 666, cu, mi, or, 23, 615, km, 3, 22, 23, of, the, world, s, surface, fresh, water, because, of, their, sea, like, characteristics, such, as, rolling, waves, sustained, winds, strong, currents, great, depths, and, distant, horizons, the, five, great, lakes, have, long, been, called, inland, seas, depending, on, how, it, is, measured, by, surface, area, either, lake, superior, or, lake, michigan, huron, is, the, second, largest, lake, in, the, world, and, the, largest, freshwater, lake, lake, michigan, is, the, largest, lake, by, surface, area, that, is, entirely, within, one, country, namely, the, united, states, although, it, is, not, its, own, lake, the, great, lakes, began, to, form, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, around, 14, 000, years, ago, as, retreating, ice, sheets, exposed, the, basins, they, had, carved, into, the, land, which, then, filled, with, meltwater, the, lakes, have, been, a, major, source, for, transportation, migration, trade, and, fishing, serving, as, a, habitat, to, many, aquatic, species, in, a, region, with, much, biodiversity, the, surrounding, region, is, called, the, great, lakes, region, which, includes, the, great, lakes, megalopolis, major, cities, within, the, region, include, on, the, american, side, cleveland, detroit, chicago, and, milwaukee, and, on, the, canadian, side, toronto, hamilton, and, mississauga, though, the, five, lakes, lie, in, separate, basins, they, form, a, single, naturally, interconnected, body, of, fresh, water, within, the, great, lakes, basin, as, a, chain, of, lakes, and, rivers, they, connect, the, east, central, interior, of, north, america, to, the, atlantic, ocean, from, the, interior, to, the, outlet, at, the, saint, lawrence, river, water, flows, from, superior, to, huron, and, michigan, southward, to, erie, and, finally, northward, to, lake, ontario, the, lakes, drain, a, large, watershed, via, many, rivers, and, contain, approximately, 35, 000, islands, there, are, also, several, thousand, smaller, lakes, often, called, inland, lakes, within, the, basin, the, surface, area, of, the, five, primary, lakes, combined, is, roughly, equal, to, the, size, of, the, united, kingdom, while, the, surface, area, of, the, entire, basin, the, lakes, and, the, land, they, drain, is, about, the, size, of, the, uk, and, france, combined, lake, michigan, is, the, only, one, of, the, great, lakes, that, is, entirely, within, the, united, states, the, others, form, a, water, boundary, between, the, united, states, and, canada, the, lakes, are, divided, among, the, jurisdictions, of, the, canadian, province, of, ontario, and, the, u, s, states, of, michigan, wisconsin, minnesota, illinois, indiana, ohio, pennsylvania, and, new, york, both, the, province, of, ontario, and, the, state, of, michigan, include, in, their, boundaries, portions, of, four, of, the, lakes, the, province, of, ontario, does, not, border, lake, michigan, and, the, state, of, michigan, does, not, border, lake, ontario, new, york, and, wisconsin, s, jurisdictions, extend, into, two, lakes, and, each, of, the, remaining, states, into, one, of, the, lakes, as, the, surfaces, of, lakes, superior, huron, michigan, and, erie, are, all, approximately, the, same, elevation, above, sea, level, while, lake, ontario, is, significantly, lower, and, because, the, niagara, escarpment, precludes, all, natural, navigation, the, four, upper, lakes, are, commonly, called, the, upper, great, lakes, this, designation, is, not, universal, those, living, on, the, shore, of, lake, superior, often, refer, to, all, the, other, lakes, as, the, lower, lakes, because, they, are, farther, south, sailors, of, bulk, freighters, transferring, cargoes, from, lake, superior, and, northern, lake, michigan, and, lake, huron, to, ports, on, lake, erie, or, ontario, commonly, refer, to, the, latter, as, the, lower, lakes, and, lakes, michigan, huron, and, superior, as, the, upper, lakes, this, corresponds, to, thinking, of, lakes, erie, and, ontario, as, down, south, and, the, others, as, up, north, vessels, sailing, north, on, lake, michigan, are, considered, upbound, even, though, they, are, sailing, toward, its, effluent, current, lakes, huron, and, michigan, are, sometimes, considered, a, single, lake, called, lake, michigan, huron, because, they, are, one, hydrological, body, of, water, connected, by, the, straits, of, mackinac, the, straits, are, five, miles, 8, km, wide, and, 120, feet, 37, m, deep, the, water, levels, rise, and, fall, together, and, the, flow, between, michigan, and, huron, frequently, reverses, direction, dispersed, throughout, the, great, lakes, are, approximately, 35, 000, islands, the, largest, among, them, is, manitoulin, island, in, lake, huron, the, largest, island, in, any, inland, body, of, water, in, the, world, the, second, largest, island, is, isle, royale, in, lake, superior, both, of, these, islands, are, large, enough, to, contain, multiple, lakes, themselves, for, instance, manitoulin, island, s, lake, manitou, is, the, world, s, largest, lake, on, a, freshwater, island, some, of, these, lakes, even, have, their, own, islands, like, treasure, island, in, lake, mindemoya, in, manitoulin, island, the, great, lakes, also, have, several, peninsulas, between, them, including, the, door, peninsula, the, peninsulas, of, michigan, and, the, ontario, peninsula, some, of, these, peninsulas, even, contain, smaller, peninsulas, such, as, the, bruce, keweenaw, leelanau, niagara, and, thumb, peninsulas, population, centers, on, the, peninsulas, include, grand, rapids, flint, and, detroit, in, michigan, along, with, london, hamilton, brantford, and, toronto, in, ontario, although, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, and, great, lakes, waterway, make, the, great, lakes, accessible, to, ocean, going, vessels, shifts, in, shipping, to, wider, ocean, going, container, ships, which, do, not, fit, through, the, locks, on, these, routes, have, limited, container, shipping, on, the, lakes, most, great, lakes, trade, is, of, bulk, material, and, bulk, freighters, of, seawaymax, size, or, less, can, move, throughout, the, entire, lakes, and, out, to, the, atlantic, larger, ships, are, confined, to, working, within, the, lakes, only, barges, can, access, the, illinois, waterway, system, providing, access, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, via, the, mississippi, river, despite, their, vast, size, large, sections, of, the, great, lakes, freeze, over, in, winter, interrupting, most, shipping, from, january, to, march, some, icebreakers, ply, the, lakes, keeping, the, shipping, lanes, open, through, other, periods, of, ice, on, the, lakes, the, great, lakes, are, connected, by, the, chicago, sanitary, and, ship, canal, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, via, the, illinois, river, from, the, chicago, river, and, the, mississippi, river, an, alternate, track, is, via, the, illinois, river, from, chicago, to, the, mississippi, up, the, ohio, and, then, through, the, tennessee, tombigbee, waterway, a, combination, of, a, series, of, rivers, and, lakes, and, canals, to, mobile, bay, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, commercial, tug, and, barge, traffic, on, these, waterways, is, heavy, pleasure, boats, can, enter, or, exit, the, great, lakes, by, way, of, the, erie, canal, and, hudson, river, in, new, york, the, erie, canal, connects, to, the, great, lakes, at, the, east, end, of, lake, erie, at, buffalo, new, york, and, at, the, south, side, of, lake, ontario, at, oswego, new, york, the, lakes, were, originally, fed, by, both, precipitation, and, meltwater, from, glaciers, which, are, no, longer, present, in, modern, times, only, about, 1, of, volume, per, year, is, new, water, originating, from, rivers, precipitation, and, groundwater, springs, in, the, post, glacial, period, evaporation, and, drainage, have, generally, been, balanced, making, the, levels, of, the, lakes, relatively, constant, intensive, human, population, growth, began, in, the, region, in, the, 20th, century, and, continues, today, at, least, two, human, water, use, activities, have, been, identified, as, having, the, potential, to, affect, the, lakes, levels, diversion, the, transfer, of, water, to, other, watersheds, and, consumption, substantially, done, today, by, the, use, of, lake, water, to, power, and, cool, electric, generation, plants, resulting, in, evaporation, outflows, through, the, chicago, sanitary, and, ship, canal, is, more, than, balanced, by, artificial, inflows, via, the, ogoki, river, and, long, lake, kenogami, river, diversions, fluctuation, of, the, water, levels, in, the, lakes, has, been, observed, since, records, began, in, 1918, the, water, level, of, lake, michigan, huron, had, remained, fairly, constant, over, the, 20th, century, recent, lake, levels, include, record, low, levels, in, 2013, in, lakes, superior, erie, and, michigan, huron, followed, by, record, high, levels, in, 2020, in, the, same, lakes, the, water, level, in, lake, ontario, has, remained, relatively, constant, in, the, same, time, period, hovering, around, the, historical, average, level, the, lake, levels, are, affected, primarily, by, changes, in, regional, meteorology, and, climatology, the, outflows, from, lakes, superior, and, ontario, are, regulated, while, the, outflows, of, michigan, huron, and, erie, are, not, regulated, at, all, ontario, is, the, most, tightly, regulated, with, its, outflow, controlled, by, the, moses, saunders, power, dam, which, explains, its, consistent, historical, levels, the, great, lakes, contain, 21, of, the, world, s, surface, fresh, water, 5, 472, cubic, miles, 22, 810, km, 3, or, 6, 0, 10, 15, u, s, gallons, that, is, 6, quadrillion, u, s, gallons, 2, 3, 10, 16, liters, the, lakes, contain, about, 84, of, the, surface, freshwater, of, north, america, if, the, water, were, evenly, distributed, over, the, entire, continent, s, land, area, it, would, reach, a, depth, of, 5, feet, 1, 5, meters, this, is, enough, water, to, cover, the, 48, contiguous, u, s, states, to, a, uniform, depth, of, 9, 5, feet, 2, 9, m, although, the, lakes, contain, a, large, percentage, of, the, world, s, fresh, water, the, great, lakes, supply, only, a, small, portion, of, u, s, drinking, water, on, a, national, basis, the, total, surface, area, of, the, lakes, is, approximately, 94, 250, square, miles, 244, 100, km, 2, nearly, the, same, size, as, the, united, kingdom, and, larger, than, the, u, s, states, of, new, york, new, jersey, connecticut, rhode, island, massachusetts, vermont, and, new, hampshire, combined, the, great, lakes, coast, measures, approximately, 10, 500, miles, 16, 900, km, but, the, length, of, a, coastline, is, impossible, to, measure, exactly, canada, borders, approximately, 5, 200, miles, 8, 400, km, of, coastline, while, the, remaining, 5, 300, miles, 8, 500, km, are, bordered, by, the, united, states, michigan, has, the, longest, shoreline, of, the, united, states, bordering, roughly, 3, 288, miles, 5, 292, km, of, lakes, followed, by, wisconsin, 820, miles, 1, 320, km, new, york, 473, miles, 761, km, and, ohio, 312, miles, 502, km, traversing, the, shoreline, of, all, the, lakes, would, cover, a, distance, roughly, equivalent, to, travelling, half, way, around, the, world, at, the, equator, a, notable, modern, phenomenon, is, the, formation, of, ice, volcanoes, over, the, lakes, during, wintertime, storm, generated, waves, carve, the, lakes, ice, sheet, and, create, conical, mounds, through, the, eruption, of, water, and, slush, the, process, is, only, well, documented, in, the, great, lakes, and, has, been, credited, with, sparing, the, southern, shorelines, from, worse, rocky, erosion, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, foundational, geology, that, created, the, conditions, shaping, the, present, day, upper, great, lakes, was, laid, from, 1, 1, to, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, when, two, previously, fused, tectonic, plates, split, apart, and, created, the, midcontinent, rift, which, crossed, the, great, lakes, tectonic, zone, a, valley, was, formed, providing, a, basin, that, eventually, became, modern, day, lake, superior, when, a, second, fault, line, the, saint, lawrence, rift, formed, approximately, 570, million, years, ago, the, basis, for, lakes, ontario, and, erie, was, created, along, with, what, would, become, the, saint, lawrence, river, the, great, lakes, are, estimated, to, have, been, formed, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, wisconsin, glaciation, ended, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, years, ago, when, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, receded, the, retreat, of, the, ice, sheet, left, behind, a, large, amount, of, meltwater, lake, algonquin, lake, chicago, glacial, lake, iroquois, and, champlain, sea, that, filled, up, the, basins, that, the, glaciers, had, carved, thus, creating, the, great, lakes, as, they, are, today, because, of, the, uneven, nature, of, glacier, erosion, some, higher, hills, became, great, lakes, islands, the, niagara, escarpment, follows, the, contour, of, the, great, lakes, between, new, york, and, wisconsin, land, below, the, glaciers, rebounded, as, it, was, uncovered, since, the, glaciers, covered, some, areas, longer, than, others, this, glacial, rebound, occurred, at, different, rates, the, great, lakes, have, a, humid, continental, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, dfa, in, southern, areas, and, dfb, in, northern, parts, with, varying, influences, from, air, masses, from, other, regions, including, dry, cold, arctic, systems, mild, pacific, air, masses, from, the, west, and, warm, wet, tropical, systems, from, the, south, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, lakes, have, a, moderating, effect, on, the, climate, they, can, also, increase, precipitation, totals, and, produce, lake, effect, snowfall, the, great, lakes, can, have, an, effect, on, regional, weather, called, lake, effect, snow, which, is, sometimes, very, localized, even, late, in, winter, the, lakes, often, have, no, icepack, in, the, middle, the, prevailing, winds, from, the, west, pick, up, the, air, and, moisture, from, the, lake, surface, which, is, slightly, warmer, in, relation, to, the, cold, surface, winds, above, as, the, slightly, warmer, moist, air, passes, over, the, colder, land, surface, the, moisture, often, produces, concentrated, heavy, snowfall, that, sets, up, in, bands, or, streamers, this, is, similar, to, the, effect, of, warmer, air, dropping, snow, as, it, passes, over, mountain, ranges, during, freezing, weather, with, high, winds, the, snowbelts, receive, regular, snow, fall, from, this, localized, weather, pattern, especially, along, the, eastern, shores, of, the, lakes, snowbelts, are, found, in, wisconsin, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, new, york, and, ontario, related, to, the, lake, effect, is, the, regular, occurrence, of, fog, particularly, along, the, shorelines, of, the, lakes, this, is, most, noticeable, along, lake, superior, s, shores, the, lakes, tend, to, moderate, seasonal, temperatures, to, some, degree, but, not, with, as, large, an, influence, as, do, large, oceans, they, absorb, heat, and, cool, the, air, in, summer, then, slowly, radiate, that, heat, in, autumn, they, protect, against, frost, during, transitional, weather, and, keep, the, summertime, temperatures, cooler, than, further, inland, this, effect, can, be, very, localized, and, overridden, by, offshore, wind, patterns, this, temperature, buffering, produces, areas, known, as, fruit, belts, where, fruit, can, be, produced, that, is, typically, grown, much, farther, south, for, instance, western, michigan, has, apple, orchards, and, cherry, orchards, are, cultivated, adjacent, to, the, lake, shore, as, far, north, as, the, grand, traverse, bay, near, collingwood, ontario, commercial, fruit, orchards, including, a, few, wineries, exist, near, the, shoreline, of, southern, nottawasaga, bay, the, eastern, shore, of, lake, michigan, and, the, southern, shore, of, lake, erie, have, many, successful, wineries, because, of, the, lakes, moderating, effects, as, do, the, large, commercial, fruit, and, wine, growing, areas, of, the, niagara, peninsula, located, between, lake, erie, and, lake, ontario, a, similar, phenomenon, allows, wineries, to, flourish, in, the, finger, lakes, region, of, new, york, as, well, as, in, prince, edward, county, ontario, on, lake, ontario, s, northeast, shore, the, great, lakes, have, been, observed, to, help, intensify, storms, such, as, hurricane, hazel, in, 1954, and, the, 2011, goderich, ontario, tornado, which, moved, onshore, as, a, tornadic, waterspout, in, 1996, a, rare, tropical, or, subtropical, storm, was, observed, forming, in, lake, huron, dubbed, the, 1996, lake, huron, cyclone, rather, large, severe, thunderstorms, covering, wide, areas, are, well, known, in, the, great, lakes, during, mid, summer, these, mesoscale, convective, complexes, or, mccs, can, cause, damage, to, wide, swaths, of, forest, and, shatter, glass, in, city, buildings, these, storms, mainly, occur, during, the, night, and, the, systems, sometimes, have, small, embedded, tornadoes, but, more, often, straight, line, winds, accompanied, by, intense, lightning, historically, the, great, lakes, in, addition, to, their, lake, ecology, were, surrounded, by, various, forest, ecoregions, except, in, a, relatively, small, area, of, southeast, lake, michigan, where, savanna, or, prairie, occasionally, intruded, logging, urbanization, and, agriculture, uses, have, changed, that, relationship, in, the, early, 21st, century, lake, superior, s, shores, are, 91, forested, lake, huron, 68, lake, ontario, 49, lake, michigan, 41, and, lake, erie, where, logging, and, urbanization, has, been, most, extensive, 21, some, of, these, forests, are, second, or, third, growth, i, e, they, have, been, logged, before, changing, their, composition, at, least, 13, wildlife, species, are, documented, as, becoming, extinct, since, the, arrival, of, europeans, and, many, more, are, threatened, or, endangered, meanwhile, exotic, and, invasive, species, have, also, been, introduced, while, the, organisms, living, on, the, bottom, of, shallow, waters, are, similar, to, those, found, in, smaller, lakes, the, deep, waters, contain, organisms, found, only, in, deep, cold, lakes, of, the, northern, latitudes, these, include, the, delicate, opossum, shrimp, order, mysida, the, deepwater, scud, a, crustacean, of, the, order, amphipoda, two, types, of, copepods, and, the, deepwater, sculpin, a, spiny, large, headed, fish, the, great, lakes, are, an, important, source, of, fishing, early, european, settlers, were, astounded, by, both, the, variety, and, quantity, of, fish, there, were, 150, different, species, in, the, great, lakes, throughout, history, fish, populations, were, the, early, indicator, of, the, condition, of, the, lakes, and, have, remained, one, of, the, key, indicators, even, in, the, current, era, of, sophisticated, analyses, and, measuring, instruments, according, to, the, bi, national, u, s, and, canadian, resource, book, the, great, lakes, an, environmental, atlas, and, resource, book, the, largest, great, lakes, fish, harvests, were, recorded, in, 1889, and, 1899, at, some, 67, 000, tonnes, 66, 000, long, tons, 74, 000, short, tons, by, 1801, the, new, york, legislature, found, it, necessary, to, pass, regulations, curtailing, obstructions, to, the, natural, migrations, of, atlantic, salmon, from, lake, erie, into, their, spawning, channels, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, government, of, upper, canada, found, it, necessary, to, introduce, similar, legislation, prohibiting, the, use, of, weirs, and, nets, at, the, mouths, of, lake, ontario, s, tributaries, other, protective, legislation, was, passed, but, enforcement, remained, difficult, on, both, sides, of, the, canada, united, states, border, the, proliferation, of, dams, and, impoundments, have, multiplied, necessitating, more, regulatory, efforts, concerns, by, the, mid, 19th, century, included, obstructions, in, the, rivers, which, prevented, salmon, and, lake, sturgeon, from, reaching, their, spawning, grounds, the, wisconsin, fisheries, commission, noted, a, reduction, of, roughly, 25, in, general, fish, harvests, by, 1875, the, states, have, removed, dams, from, rivers, where, necessary, overfishing, has, been, cited, as, a, possible, reason, for, a, decrease, in, population, of, various, whitefish, important, because, of, their, culinary, desirability, and, hence, economic, consequence, moreover, between, 1879, and, 1899, reported, whitefish, harvests, declined, from, some, 24, 3, million, pounds, 11, million, kg, to, just, over, 9, million, pounds, 4, million, kg, by, 1900, commercial, fishermen, on, lake, michigan, were, hauling, in, an, average, of, 41, million, pounds, of, fish, annually, by, 1938, wisconsin, s, commercial, fishing, operations, were, motorized, and, mechanized, generating, jobs, for, more, than, 2, 000, workers, and, hauling, 14, million, pounds, per, year, the, population, of, giant, freshwater, mussels, was, eliminated, as, the, mussels, were, harvested, for, use, as, buttons, by, early, great, lakes, entrepreneurs, the, great, lakes, an, environmental, atlas, and, resource, book, 1972, notes, only, pockets, remain, of, the, once, large, commercial, fishery, water, quality, improvements, realized, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, combined, with, successful, salmonid, stocking, programs, have, enabled, the, growth, of, a, large, recreational, fishery, the, last, commercial, fisherman, left, milwaukee, in, 2011, because, of, overfishing, and, anthropogenic, changes, to, the, biosphere, since, the, 19th, century, an, estimated, 160, new, species, have, found, their, way, into, the, great, lakes, ecosystem, many, have, become, invasive, the, overseas, ship, ballast, and, ship, hull, parasitism, are, causing, severe, economic, and, ecological, impacts, according, to, the, inland, seas, education, association, on, average, a, new, species, enters, the, great, lakes, every, eight, months, introductions, into, the, great, lakes, include, the, zebra, mussel, which, was, first, discovered, in, 1988, and, quagga, mussel, in, 1989, since, 2000, the, invasive, quagga, mussel, has, smothered, the, bottom, of, lake, michigan, almost, from, shore, to, shore, and, their, numbers, are, estimated, at, 900, trillion, the, mollusks, are, efficient, filter, feeders, competing, with, native, mussels, and, reducing, available, food, and, spawning, grounds, for, fish, in, addition, the, mussels, may, be, a, nuisance, to, industries, by, clogging, pipes, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, estimated, in, 2007, that, the, economic, impact, of, the, zebra, mussel, could, be, about, 5, billion, over, the, next, decade, the, alewife, first, entered, the, system, west, of, lake, ontario, via, 19th, century, canals, by, the, 1960s, the, small, silver, fish, had, become, a, familiar, nuisance, to, beach, goers, across, lakes, michigan, huron, and, erie, periodic, mass, die, offs, result, in, vast, numbers, of, the, fish, washing, up, on, shore, estimates, by, various, governments, have, placed, the, percentage, of, lake, michigan, s, biomass, which, was, made, up, of, alewives, in, the, early, 1960s, as, high, as, 90, in, the, late, 1960s, the, various, state, and, federal, governments, began, stocking, several, species, of, salmonids, including, the, native, lake, trout, as, well, as, non, native, chinook, and, coho, salmon, by, the, 1980s, alewife, populations, had, dropped, drastically, the, ruffe, a, small, percid, fish, from, eurasia, became, the, most, abundant, fish, species, in, lake, superior, s, saint, louis, river, within, five, years, of, its, detection, in, 1986, its, range, which, has, expanded, to, lake, huron, poses, a, significant, threat, to, the, lower, lake, fishery, five, years, after, first, being, observed, in, the, st, clair, river, the, round, goby, can, now, be, found, in, all, of, the, great, lakes, the, goby, is, considered, undesirable, for, several, reasons, it, preys, upon, bottom, feeding, fish, overruns, optimal, habitat, spawns, multiple, times, a, season, and, can, survive, poor, water, quality, conditions, the, influx, of, parasitic, lamprey, populations, after, the, development, of, the, erie, canal, and, the, much, later, welland, canal, led, to, the, two, federal, governments, of, the, united, states, and, canada, working, on, joint, proposals, to, control, it, by, the, mid, 1950s, the, lake, trout, populations, of, lakes, michigan, and, huron, were, reduced, with, the, lamprey, deemed, largely, to, blame, this, led, to, the, launch, of, the, bi, national, great, lakes, fishery, commission, several, species, of, exotic, water, fleas, have, accidentally, been, introduced, into, the, great, lakes, such, as, the, spiny, waterflea, bythotrephes, longimanus, and, the, fishhook, waterflea, cercopagis, pengoi, potentially, having, an, effect, on, the, zooplankton, population, several, species, of, crayfish, have, also, been, introduced, that, may, contend, with, native, crayfish, populations, more, recently, an, electric, fence, has, been, set, up, across, the, chicago, sanitary, and, ship, canal, in, order, to, keep, several, species, of, invasive, asian, carp, out, of, the, lakes, these, fast, growing, planktivorous, fish, have, heavily, colonized, the, mississippi, and, illinois, river, systems, invasive, species, particularly, zebra, and, quagga, mussels, may, be, at, least, partially, responsible, for, the, collapse, of, the, deepwater, demersal, fish, community, in, lake, huron, as, well, as, drastic, unprecedented, changes, in, the, zooplankton, community, of, the, lake, scientists, understand, that, the, micro, aquatic, life, of, the, lakes, is, abundant, but, know, very, little, about, some, of, the, most, plentiful, microbes, and, their, environmental, effects, in, the, great, lakes, although, a, drop, of, lake, water, may, contain, 1, million, bacteria, cells, and, 10, million, viruses, only, since, 2012, has, there, been, a, long, term, study, of, the, lakes, micro, organisms, between, 2012, and, 2019, more, than, 160, new, species, have, been, discovered, native, habitats, and, ecoregions, in, the, great, lakes, region, include, plant, lists, include, logging, of, the, extensive, forests, in, the, great, lakes, region, removed, riparian, and, adjacent, tree, cover, over, rivers, and, streams, which, provide, shade, moderating, water, temperatures, in, fish, spawning, grounds, removal, of, trees, also, destabilized, the, soil, with, greater, volumes, washed, into, stream, beds, causing, siltation, of, gravel, beds, and, more, frequent, flooding, running, cut, logs, down, the, tributary, rivers, into, the, great, lakes, also, dislocated, sediments, in, 1884, the, new, york, fish, commission, determined, that, the, dumping, of, sawmill, waste, chips, and, sawdust, had, impacted, fish, populations, the, first, u, s, clean, water, act, passed, by, a, congressional, override, after, being, vetoed, by, u, s, president, richard, nixon, in, 1972, was, a, key, piece, of, legislation, along, with, the, bi, national, great, lakes, water, quality, agreement, signed, by, canada, and, the, u, s, a, variety, of, steps, taken, to, process, industrial, and, municipal, pollution, discharges, into, the, system, greatly, improved, water, quality, by, the, 1980s, and, lake, erie, in, particular, is, significantly, cleaner, discharge, of, toxic, substances, has, been, sharply, reduced, federal, and, state, regulations, control, substances, like, pcbs, the, first, of, 43, great, lakes, areas, of, concern, to, be, formally, de, listed, through, successful, cleanup, was, ontario, s, collingwood, harbour, in, 1994, ontario, s, severn, sound, followed, in, 2003, presque, isle, bay, in, pennsylvania, is, formally, listed, as, in, recovery, as, is, ontario, s, spanish, harbour, dozens, of, other, areas, of, concern, have, received, partial, cleanups, such, as, the, rouge, river, michigan, and, waukegan, harbor, illinois, phosphate, detergents, were, historically, a, major, source, of, nutrient, to, the, great, lakes, algae, blooms, in, particular, in, the, warmer, and, shallower, portions, of, the, system, such, as, lake, erie, saginaw, bay, green, bay, and, the, southernmost, portion, of, lake, michigan, by, the, mid, 1980s, most, jurisdictions, bordering, the, great, lakes, had, controlled, phosphate, detergents, blue, green, algae, or, cyanobacteria, blooms, have, been, problematic, on, lake, erie, since, 2011, not, enough, is, being, done, to, stop, fertilizer, and, phosphorus, from, getting, into, the, lake, and, causing, blooms, said, michael, mckay, executive, director, of, the, great, lakes, institute, for, environmental, research, glier, at, the, university, of, windsor, the, largest, lake, erie, bloom, to, date, occurred, in, 2015, exceeding, the, severity, index, at, 10, 5, and, in, 2011, at, a, 10, in, early, august, 2019, satellite, images, depicted, a, bloom, stretching, up, to, 1, 300, square, kilometres, on, lake, erie, with, the, heaviest, concentration, near, toledo, ohio, a, large, bloom, does, not, necessarily, mean, the, cyanobacteria, will, produce, toxins, said, michael, mckay, of, the, university, of, windsor, water, quality, testing, was, underway, in, august, 2019, until, 1970, mercury, was, not, listed, as, a, harmful, chemical, according, to, the, united, states, federal, water, quality, administration, in, the, 21st, century, mercury, has, become, more, apparent, in, water, tests, mercury, compounds, have, been, used, in, paper, mills, to, prevent, slime, from, forming, during, their, production, and, chemical, companies, have, used, mercury, to, separate, chlorine, from, brine, solutions, studies, conducted, by, the, environmental, protection, agency, have, shown, that, when, the, mercury, comes, in, contact, with, many, of, the, bacteria, and, compounds, in, the, fresh, water, it, forms, the, compound, methyl, mercury, which, has, a, much, greater, impact, on, human, health, than, elemental, mercury, due, to, a, higher, propensity, for, absorption, this, form, of, mercury, is, not, detrimental, to, a, majority, of, fish, types, but, is, very, detrimental, to, people, and, other, wildlife, animals, who, consume, the, fish, mercury, has, been, known, for, health, related, problems, such, as, birth, defects, in, humans, and, animals, and, the, near, extinction, of, eagles, in, the, great, lakes, region, the, amount, of, raw, sewage, dumped, into, the, waters, was, the, primary, focus, of, both, the, first, great, lakes, water, quality, agreement, and, federal, laws, passed, in, both, countries, during, the, 1970s, implementation, of, secondary, treatment, of, municipal, sewage, by, major, cities, greatly, reduced, the, routine, discharge, of, untreated, sewage, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, international, joint, commission, in, 2009, summarized, the, change, since, the, early, 1970s, the, level, of, treatment, to, reduce, pollution, from, waste, water, discharges, to, the, great, lakes, has, improved, considerably, this, is, a, result, of, significant, expenditures, to, date, on, both, infrastructure, and, technology, and, robust, regulatory, systems, that, have, proven, to, be, on, the, whole, quite, effective, the, commission, reported, that, all, urban, sewage, treatment, systems, on, the, u, s, side, of, the, lakes, had, implemented, secondary, treatment, as, had, all, on, the, canadian, side, except, for, five, small, systems, though, contrary, to, federal, laws, in, both, countries, those, treatment, system, upgrades, have, not, yet, eliminated, combined, sewer, overflow, events, this, describes, when, older, sewerage, systems, which, combine, storm, water, with, sewage, into, single, sewers, heading, to, the, treatment, plant, are, temporarily, overwhelmed, by, heavy, rainstorms, local, sewage, treatment, authorities, then, must, release, untreated, effluent, a, mix, of, rainwater, and, sewage, into, local, water, bodies, while, enormous, public, investments, such, as, the, deep, tunnel, projects, in, chicago, and, milwaukee, have, greatly, reduced, the, frequency, and, volume, of, these, events, they, have, not, been, eliminated, the, number, of, such, overflow, events, in, ontario, for, example, is, flat, according, to, the, international, joint, commission, reports, about, this, issue, on, the, u, s, side, highlight, five, large, municipal, systems, those, of, detroit, cleveland, buffalo, milwaukee, and, gary, as, being, the, largest, current, periodic, sources, of, untreated, discharges, into, the, great, lakes, the, fish, of, the, great, lakes, have, anti, depressant, drugs, meant, for, humans, in, their, brains, which, has, caused, concerns, the, number, of, american, adults, who, take, anti, depressant, drugs, rose, from, 7, 7, of, all, american, adults, in, 1999, 2002, to, 12, 7, in, 2011, 2014, as, the, anti, depressant, drugs, pass, out, of, human, bodies, and, through, sanitation, systems, into, the, great, lakes, this, has, resulted, in, fish, in, the, great, lakes, with, twenty, times, the, level, of, anti, depressants, in, their, brains, than, what, is, in, the, water, leading, to, the, fish, being, exceedingly, happy, and, hence, less, risk, averse, to, the, extent, of, damaging, the, fish, populations, researchers, have, found, that, more, than, 22, million, pounds, 10, 0, kt, of, plastic, end, up, in, the, great, lakes, each, year, plastics, in, the, water, break, up, into, very, small, particles, known, as, microplastics, microplastics, can, also, come, from, synthetic, clothing, washed, down, our, drains, plastic, waste, found, in, the, lakes, include, single, use, plastics, plastics, used, in, packaging, takeout, containers, as, well, as, pre, production, pellets, produced, by, plastics, industry, high, concentrations, of, microplastics, were, discovered, in, 100, percent, of, the, fish, that, were, studied, by, researchers, from, the, rochman, lab, about, 50, million, pounds, 23, kt, of, fish, is, harvested, each, year, from, great, lakes, which, has, raised, concerns, on, how, this, might, affect, human, health, microscopic, pieces, of, plastic, have, also, been, found, in, drinking, water, coming, from, great, lakes, it, is, estimated, that, nearly, 40, million, people, in, the, region, rely, on, drinking, water, from, the, great, lakes, a, number, of, self, operating, floating, devices, called, seabin, were, put, in, the, great, lakes, to, capture, plastic, trash, as, part, of, the, great, lakes, plastic, cleanup, project, the, project, captured, 74, 000, pieces, of, trash, using, this, technology, between, 2020, and, 2021, however, it, does, not, claim, to, catch, up, with, 22, million, pounds, 10, 0, kt, of, plastic, that, ends, up, in, great, lakes, every, year, the, production, consumption, and, throwing, away, of, plastics, seems, to, remain, the, core, of, great, lakes, trash, problem, algae, such, as, diatoms, along, with, other, phytoplankton, are, photosynthetic, primary, producers, supporting, the, food, web, of, the, great, lakes, and, have, been, affected, by, global, warming, the, changes, in, the, size, or, in, the, function, of, the, primary, producers, may, have, a, direct, or, an, indirect, impact, on, the, food, web, photosynthesis, carried, out, by, diatoms, constitutes, about, one, fifth, of, the, total, photosynthesis, by, taking, co, 2, out, of, the, water, to, photosynthesize, diatoms, help, to, stabilize, the, ph, of, the, water, as, co, 2, would, react, with, water, to, produce, carbonic, acid, diatoms, acquire, inorganic, carbon, through, passive, diffusion, of, co, 2, and, hco, 3, and, use, carbonic, anhydrase, mediated, active, transport, to, speed, up, this, process, large, diatoms,

southern, end, of, the, niagara, river, and, became, the, first, known, sailing, ship, to, travel, the, upper, great, lakes, on, august, 7, 1679, during, settlement, the, great, lakes, and, its, rivers, were, the, only, practical, means, of, moving, people, and, freight, barges, from, middle, north, america, were, able, to, reach, the, atlantic, ocean, from, the, great, lakes, when, the, welland, canal, opened, in, 1824, and, the, later, erie, canal, opened, in, 1825, by, 1848, with, the, opening, of, the, illinois, and, michigan, canal, at, chicago, direct, access, to, the, mississippi, river, was, possible, from, the, lakes, with, these, two, canals, an, all, inland, water, route, was, provided, between, new, york, city, and, new, orleans, the, main, business, of, many, of, the, passenger, lines, in, the, 19th, century, was, transporting, immigrants, many, of, the, larger, cities, owe, their, existence, to, their, position, on, the, lakes, as, a, freight, destination, as, well, as, for, being, a, magnet, for, immigrants, after, railroads, and, surface, roads, developed, the, freight, and, passenger, businesses, dwindled, and, except, for, ferries, and, a, few, foreign, cruise, ships, have, now, vanished, the, immigration, routes, still, have, an, effect, today, immigrants, often, formed, their, own, communities, and, some, areas, have, a, pronounced, ethnicity, such, as, dutch, german, polish, finnish, and, many, others, since, many, immigrants, settled, for, a, time, in, new, england, before, moving, westward, many, areas, on, the, u, s, side, of, the, great, lakes, also, have, a, new, england, feel, especially, in, home, styles, and, accent, since, general, freight, these, days, is, transported, by, railroads, and, trucks, domestic, ships, mostly, move, bulk, cargoes, such, as, iron, ore, coal, and, limestone, for, the, steel, industry, the, domestic, bulk, freight, developed, because, of, the, nearby, mines, it, was, more, economical, to, transport, the, ingredients, for, steel, to, centralized, plants, rather, than, to, make, steel, on, the, spot, grain, exports, are, also, a, major, cargo, on, the, lakes, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, iron, and, other, ores, such, as, copper, were, shipped, south, on, downbound, ships, and, supplies, food, and, coal, were, shipped, north, upbound, because, of, the, location, of, the, coal, fields, in, pennsylvania, and, west, virginia, and, the, general, northeast, track, of, the, appalachian, mountains, railroads, naturally, developed, shipping, routes, that, went, due, north, to, ports, such, as, erie, pennsylvania, and, ashtabula, ohio, because, the, lake, maritime, community, largely, developed, independently, it, has, some, distinctive, vocabulary, ships, no, matter, the, size, are, called, boats, when, the, sailing, ships, gave, way, to, steamships, they, were, called, steamboats, the, same, term, used, on, the, mississippi, the, ships, also, have, a, distinctive, design, ships, that, primarily, trade, on, the, lakes, are, known, as, lakers, foreign, boats, are, known, as, salties, one, of, the, more, common, sights, on, the,

lake, champlain, briefly, became, the, sixth, great, lake, of, the, united, states, on, march, 6, 1998, when, president, clinton, signed, senate, bill, 927, this, bill, which, reauthorized, the, national, sea, grant, program, contained, a, line, declaring, lake, champlain, to, be, a, great, lake, not, coincidentally, this, status, allows, neighboring, states, to, apply, for, additional, federal, research, and, education, funds, allocated, to, these, national, resources, following, a, small, uproar, the, senate, voted, to, revoke, the, designation, on, march, 24, although, new, york, and, vermont, universities, would, continue, to, receive, funds, to, monitor, and, study, the, lake, alan, b, mccullough, has, written, that, the, fishing, industry, of, the, great, lakes, got, its, start, on, the, american, side, of, lake, ontario, in, chaumont, bay, near, the, maumee, river, on, lake, erie, and, on, the, detroit, river, at, about, the, time, of, the, war, of, 1812, although, the, region, was, sparsely, populated, until, the, 1830s, so, there, was, not, much, local, demand, and, transporting, fish, was, prohibitively, costly, there, were, economic, and, infrastructure, developments, that, were, promising, for, the, future, of, the, fishing, industry, going, into, the, 1830s, particularly, the, 1825, opening, of, the, erie, canal, and, the, welland, canal, a, few, years, later, the, fishing, industry, expanded, particularly, in, the, waters, associated, with, the, fur, trade, that, connect, lake, erie, and, lake, huron, in, fact, two, major, suppliers, of, fish, in, the, 1830s, were, the, fur, trading, companies, hudson, s, bay, company, and, the, american, fur, company, the, catch, from, these, waters, was, sent, to, the, growing, market, for, salted, fish, in, detroit, where, merchants, involved, in, the, fur, trade, had, already, gained, some, experience, handling, salted, fish, one, such, merchant, was, john, p, clark, a, shipbuilder, and, merchant, who, began, selling, fish, in, the, area, of, manitowoc, wisconsin, where, whitefish, was, abundant, another, operation, cropped, up, in, georgian, bay, canadian, waters, plentiful, with, trout, as, well, as, whitefish, in, 1831, alexander, macgregor, from, goderich, ontario, found, whitefish, and, herring, in, abundant, supply, around, the, fishing, islands, a, contemporary, account, by, methodist, missionary, john, evans, describes, the, fish, as, resembling, a, bright, cloud, moving, rapidly, through, the, water, from, 1844, through, 1857, palace, steamers, carried, passengers,
