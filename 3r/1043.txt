from, h, lsingland, in, central, sweden, arrived, at, what, is, now, the, vantaa, river, and, called, it, helsing, helsinge, river, giving, rise, to, the, names, of, the, village, and, church, of, helsinge, in, the, 1300s, this, theory, is, questionable, as, dialect, research, suggests, that, the, settlers, came, from, uppland, and, the, surrounding, areas, others, have, suggested, that, the, name, derives, from, the, swedish, word, helsing, an, archaic, form, of, the, word, hals, neck, which, refers, to, the, narrowest, part, of, a, river, the, rapids, other, scandinavian, towns, in, similar, geographical, locations, were, given, similar, names, at, the, time, such, as, helsing, r, in, denmark, and, helsingborg, in, sweden, when, a, town, was, founded, in, the, village, of,

known, as, helsinge, or, helsing, from, which, the, modern, finnish, name, is, derived, official, finnish, government, documents, and, finnish, language, newspapers, have, used, the, name, helsinki, since, 1819, when, the, senate, of, finland, moved, to, the, city, from, turku, the, former, capital, of, finland, decrees, issued, in, helsinki, were, dated, with, helsinki, as, the, place, of, issue, this, is, how, the, form, helsinki, came, to, be, used, in, written, finnish, when, finland, became, a, grand, duchy, of, finland, an, autonomous, state, under, the, rule, of, the, russian, empire, helsinki, was, known, as, gel, singfors, in, russian, because, the, main, and, official, language, of, grand, duchy, of, finland, was, swedish, in, helsinki, slang, the, city, is, called,

beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, ad, during, the, iron, age, when, the, area, was, inhabited, by, the, tavastians, they, used, the, area, for, fishing, and, hunting, but, due, to, the, lack, of, archaeological, finds, it, is, difficult, to, say, how, extensive, their, settlements, were, pollen, analysis, has, shown, that, there, were, agricultural, settlements, in, the, area, in, the, 10th, century, and, surviving, historical, records, from, the, 14th, century, describe, tavastian, settlements, in, the, area, christianity, does, not, gain, a, significant, foothold, in, finland, before, the, 11th, century, after, that, a, number, of, crosses, and, other, objects, related, to, christianity, can, be, found, in, archaeological, material, according, to, the, traditional, view, the, kingdom, of, sweden, made, three, crusades, to, finland, thanks, to, which, the, region, was, incorporated, into, both, christianity, and, the, swedish, empire, recent, research, has, shown, that, these, expeditions, to, the, extent, that, there, were, even, three, of, them, were, not, the, crusades, that, had, been, imagined, later, the, conquest, of, finland, was, justified, in, terms, of, civilisation, and, christianisation, and, the, myth, of, the, crusades, was, developed, it, is, more, likely, that, it, was, a, multidimensional, combination, of, economic, cultural, and, political, power, ambitions, the, early, settlements, were, raided, by, vikings, until, 1008, and, the, battle, at, herdaler, was, a, battle, between, the, norse, viking, leader, olav, haraldsson, later, king,

coasts, of, finland, and, was, almost, killed, in, battle, he, ran, away, in, fear, and, after, that, the, vikings, did, not, raid, the, coasts, of, finland, later, the, area, was, settled, by, christians, from, sweden, they, came, mainly, from, the, swedish, coastal, regions, of, norrland, and, h, lsingland, and, their, migration, intensified, around, 1100, the, swedes, permanently, colonised, the, helsinki, region, s, coastline, in, the, late, 13th, century, after, the, successful, crusade, to, finland, that, led, to, the, defeat, of, the, tavastians, in, the, middle, ages, the, helsinki, area, was, a, landscape, of, small, villages, some, of, the, old, villages, from, the, 1240s, in, the, area, of, present, day, helsinki, such, as, koskela, and, t, l, are, now, helsinki,

the, area, and, two, interesting, medieval, buildings, were, built, here, vartiokyl, hillfort, in, the, 1380s, and, the, church, of, st, lawrence, in, 1455, in, the, middle, ages, several, thousand, people, lived, in, helsinki, s, keep, there, was, a, lot, of, trade, across, the, baltic, sea, the, shipping, route, to, the, coast, and, especially, to, reval, meant, that, by, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, the, helsinki, region, had, become, an, important, trading, centre, for, wealthy, peasants, priests, and, nobles, in, finland, after, vyborg, and, pohja, furs, wood, tar, fish, and, animals, were, exported, from, helsinki, and, salt, and, grain, were, brought, to, the, fortress, helsinki, was, also, the, most, important, cattle, breeding, area, in, uusimaa, with, the, help, of,

depending, on, the, situation, finnish, swedish, latin, or, low, german, could, be, heard, in, the, helsinki, area, written, chronicles, from, 1417, mention, the, village, of, koskela, near, the, rapids, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, vantaa, where, helsinki, was, to, be, founded, helsinki, was, founded, by, king, gustav, i, of, sweden, on, 12, june, 1550, as, a, trading, town, called, helsingfors, to, rival, the, hanseatic, city, of, reval, now, tallinn, on, the, southern, shore, of, the, gulf, of, finland, to, populate, the, new, town, at, the, mouth, of, the, vantaa, river, the,

settlers, to, leave, the, unfortunate, location, in, 1640, count, per, brahe, the, younger, together, with, some, descendants, of, the, original, settlers, moved, the, centre, of, the, city, to, the, vironniemi, peninsula, by, the, sea, today, s, kruununhaka, district, where, the, senate, square, and, helsinki, cathedral, are, located, during, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, helsinki, as, a, wooden, city, suffered, from, regular, fires, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, the, population, had, fallen, below, 1, 700, for, a, long, time, helsinki, was, mainly, a, small, administrative, town, for, the, governors, of, nyland, and, tavastehus, county, but, its, importance, began, to, grow, in, the, 18th, century, when, plans, were, made, to, build, a, more, solid, naval, defence, in, front, of, the, city, little, came, of, these, plans, however, as, helsinki, remained, a, small, town, plagued, by, poverty, war, and, disease, the, plague, of, 1710, killed, most, of, helsinki, s, population, after, the, russians, captured, helsinki, in, may, 1713, during, the, great, northern, war, the, retreating, swedish, administration, set, fire, to, parts, of, the, city, despite, this, the, city, s, population, grew, to, 3, 000, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, construction, of, the, naval, fortress, of, sveaborg, viapori, in, finnish, now, also, called, suomenlinna, in, the, 18th, century, helped, to, improve, helsinki, s, status, however, it, wasn, t, until, russia, defeated, sweden, in, the, finnish, war, and, annexed, finland, as, the, autonomous, grand, duchy, of, finland, in, 1809, that, the, city, began, to, develop, into, a, substantial, city, the, russians, besieged, the, sveaborg, fortress, during, the, war, and, about, a, quarter, of, the, city, was, destroyed, in, a, fire, in, 1808, emperor, alexander, i, of, russia, moved, the, capital, of, finland, from, turku, to, helsinki, on, 8, april, 1812, to, reduce, swedish, influence, in, finland, and, bring, the, capital, closer, to, st, petersburg, after, the, great, fire, of, turku, in, 1827, the, royal, academy, of, turku, the, only, university, in, the, country, at, the, time, was, also, moved, to, helsinki, and, eventually, became, the, modern, university, of, helsinki, the, move, consolidated, the, city, s, new, role, and, helped, set, it, on, a, path, of, continuous, growth, this, transformation, is, most, evident, in, the, city, centre, which, was, rebuilt, in, the, neoclassical, style, to, resemble, st, petersburg, largely, according, to, a, plan, by, the, german, born, architect, c, l, engel, as, elsewhere, technological, advances, such, as, the, railway, and, industrialisation, were, key, factors, in, the, city, s, growth, by, the, 1910s, helsinki, s, population, was, already, over, 100, 000, and, despite, the, turbulence, of, finnish, history, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, helsinki, continued, to, grow, steadily, this, included, the, finnish, civil, war, and, the, winter, war, both, of, which, left, their, mark, on, the, city, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, there, were, roughly, equal, numbers, of,
