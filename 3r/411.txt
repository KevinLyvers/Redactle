the, amazon, rainforest, also, called, amazon, jungle, or, amazonia, is, a, moist, broadleaf, tropical, rainforest, in, the, amazon, biome, that, covers, most, of, the, amazon, basin, of, south, america, this, basin, encompasses, 7, 000, 000, km, 2, 2, 700, 000, sq, mi, of, which, 6, 000, 000, km, 2, 2, 300, 000, sq, mi, are, covered, by, the, rainforest, this, region, includes, territory, belonging, to, nine, nations, and, 3, 344, indigenous, territories, the, majority, of, the, forest, 60, is, in, brazil, followed, by, peru, with, 13, colombia, with, 10, and, with, minor, amounts, in, bolivia, ecuador, french, guiana, guyana, suriname, and, venezuela, four, nations, have, amazonas, as, the, name, of, one, of, their, first, level, administrative, regions, and, france, uses, the, name, guiana, amazonian, park, for, french, guiana, s, protected, rainforest, area, the, amazon, represents, over, half, of, earth, s, remaining, rainforests, and, comprises, the, largest, and, most, biodiverse, tract, of, tropical, rainforest, in, the, world, with, an, estimated, 390, billion, individual, trees, in, about, 16, 000, species, more, than, 30, million, people, of, 350, different, ethnic, groups, live, in, the, amazon, which, are, subdivided, into, 9, different, national, political, systems, and, 3, 344, formally, acknowledged, indigenous, territories, indigenous, peoples, make, up, 9, of, the, total, population, and, 60, of, the, groups, remain, largely, isolated, large, scale, deforestation, is, occurring, in, the, forest, creating, different, harmful, effects, economic, losses, due, to, deforestation, in, brazil, could, be, approximately, 7, times, higher, in, comparison, to, the, cost, of, all, commodities, produced, through, deforestation, in, 2023, the, world, bank, published, a, report, proposing, a, non, deforestation, based, economic, program, in, the, region, the, name, amazon, is, said, to, arise, from, a, war, francisco, de, orellana, fought, with, the, tapuyas, and, other, tribes, the, women, of, the, tribe, fought, alongside, the, men, as, was, their, custom, orellana, derived, the, name, amazonas, from, the, amazons, of, greek, mythology, described, by, herodotus, and, diodorus, based, on, archaeological, evidence, from, an, excavation, at, caverna, da, pedra, pintada, human, inhabitants, first, settled, in, the, amazon, region, at, least, 11, 200, years, ago, subsequent, development, led, to, late, prehistoric, settlements, along, the, periphery, of, the, forest, by, ad, 1250, which, induced, alterations, in, the, forest, cover, for, a, long, time, it, was, thought, that, the, amazon, rainforest, was, never, more, than, sparsely, populated, as, it, was, impossible, to, sustain, a, large, population, through, agriculture, given, the, poor, soil, archeologist, betty, meggers, was, a, prominent, proponent, of, this, idea, as, described, in, her, book, amazonia, man, and, culture, in, a, counterfeit, paradise, she, claimed, that, a, population, density, of, 0, 2, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, 0, 52, sq, mi, is, the, maximum, that, can, be, sustained, in, the, rainforest, through, hunting, with, agriculture, needed, to, host, a, larger, population, however, recent, anthropological, findings, have, suggested, that, the, region, was, actually, densely, populated, the, upano, valley, sites, in, present, day, eastern, ecuador, predate, all, known, complex, amazonian, societies, some, 5, million, people, may, have, lived, in, the, amazon, region, in, ad, 1500, divided, between, dense, coastal, settlements, such, as, that, at, maraj, and, inland, dwellers, based, on, projections, of, food, production, one, estimate, suggests, over, 8, million, people, living, in, the, amazon, in, 1492, by, 1900, the, native, indigenous, population, had, fallen, to, 1, million, and, by, the, early, 1980s, it, was, less, than, 200, 000, the, first, european, to, travel, the, length, of, the, amazon, river, was, francisco, de, orellana, in, 1542, the, bbc, s, unnatural, histories, presents, evidence, that, orellana, rather, than, exaggerating, his, claims, as, previously, thought, was, correct, in, his, observations, that, a, complex, civilization, was, flourishing, along, the, amazon, in, the, 1540s, the, pre, columbian, agriculture, in, the, amazon, basin, was, sufficiently, advanced, to, support, prosperous, and, populous, societies, it, is, believed, that, civilization, was, later, devastated, by, the, spread, of, diseases, from, europe, such, as, smallpox, this, civilization, was, investigated, by, the, british, explorer, percy, fawcett, in, the, early, twentieth, century, the, results, of, his, expeditions, were, inconclusive, and, he, disappeared, mysteriously, on, his, last, trip, his, name, for, this, lost, civilization, was, the, city, of, z, since, the, 1970s, numerous, geoglyphs, have, been, discovered, on, deforested, land, dating, between, ad, 1, 1250, furthering, claims, about, pre, columbian, civilizations, ondemar, dias, is, accredited, with, first, discovering, the, geoglyphs, in, 1977, and, alceu, ranzi, is, credited, with, furthering, their, discovery, after, flying, over, acre, the, bbc, s, unnatural, histories, presented, evidence, that, the, amazon, rainforest, rather, than, being, a, pristine, wilderness, has, been, shaped, by, man, for, at, least, 11, 000, years, through, practices, such, as, forest, gardening, and, terra, preta, terra, preta, is, found, over, large, areas, in, the, amazon, forest, and, is, now, widely, accepted, as, a, product, of, indigenous, soil, management, the, development, of, this, fertile, soil, allowed, agriculture, and, silviculture, in, the, previously, hostile, environment, meaning, that, large, portions, of, the, amazon, rainforest, are, probably, the, result, of, centuries, of, human, management, rather, than, naturally, occurring, as, has, previously, been, supposed, in, the, region, of, the, xingu, tribe, remains, of, some, of, these, large, settlements, in, the, middle, of, the, amazon, forest, were, found, in, 2003, by, michael, heckenberger, and, colleagues, of, the, university, of, florida, among, those, were, evidence, of, roads, bridges, and, large, plazas, in, the, amazonas, there, has, been, fighting, and, wars, between, the, neighboring, tribes, of, the, jivaro, several, tribes, of, the, jivaroan, group, including, the, shuar, practised, headhunting, for, trophies, and, headshrinking, the, accounts, of, missionaries, to, the, area, in, the, borderlands, between, brazil, and, venezuela, have, recounted, constant, infighting, in, the, yanomami, tribes, more, than, a, third, of, the, yanomamo, males, on, average, died, from, warfare, the, munduruku, were, a, warlike, tribe, that, expanded, along, the, tapaj, s, river, and, its, tributaries, and, were, feared, by, neighboring, tribes, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, munduruku, were, pacified, and, subjugated, by, the, brazilians, during, the, amazon, rubber, boom, it, is, estimated, that, diseases, brought, by, immigrants, such, as, typhus, and, malaria, killed, 40, 000, native, amazonians, in, the, 1950s, brazilian, explorer, and, defender, of, indigenous, people, c, ndido, rondon, supported, the, villas, b, as, brothers, campaign, which, faced, strong, opposition, from, the, government, and, the, ranchers, of, mato, grosso, and, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, first, brazilian, national, park, for, indigenous, people, along, the, xingu, river, in, 1961, in, 1961, british, explorer, richard, mason, was, killed, by, an, uncontacted, amazon, tribe, known, as, the, panar, the, mats, s, made, their, first, permanent, contact, with, the, outside, world, in, 1969, before, that, date, they, were, effectively, at, war, with, the, peruvian, government, nine, countries, share, the, amazon, basin, most, of, the, rainforest, 58, 4, is, contained, within, the, borders, of, brazil, the, other, eight, countries, are, peru, with, 12, 8, bolivia, with, 7, 7, colombia, with, 7, 1, venezuela, with, 6, 1, guyana, with, 3, 1, suriname, with, 2, 5, french, guiana, with, 1, 4, and, ecuador, with, 1, the, rainforest, likely, formed, during, the, eocene, era, from, 56, million, years, to, 33, 9, million, years, ago, it, appeared, following, a, global, reduction, of, tropical, temperatures, when, the, atlantic, ocean, had, widened, sufficiently, to, provide, a, warm, moist, climate, to, the, amazon, basin, the, rainforest, has, been, in, existence, for, at, least, 55, million, years, and, most, of, the, region, remained, free, of, savanna, type, biomes, at, least, until, the, current, ice, age, when, the, climate, was, drier, and, savanna, more, widespread, following, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, the, extinction, of, the, dinosaurs, and, the, wetter, climate, may, have, allowed, the, tropical, rainforest, to, spread, out, across, the, continent, from, 66, to, 34, mya, the, rainforest, extended, as, far, south, as, 45, climate, fluctuations, during, the, last, 34, million, years, have, allowed, savanna, regions, to, expand, into, the, tropics, during, the, oligocene, for, example, the, rainforest, spanned, a, relatively, narrow, band, it, expanded, again, during, the, middle, miocene, then, retracted, to, a, mostly, inland, formation, at, the, last, glacial, maximum, however, the, rainforest, still, managed, to, thrive, during, these, glacial, periods, allowing, for, the, survival, and, evolution, of, a, broad, diversity, of, species, during, the, mid, eocene, it, is, believed, that, the, drainage, basin, of, the, amazon, was, split, along, the, middle, of, the, continent, by, the, purus, arch, water, on, the, eastern, side, flowed, toward, the, atlantic, while, to, the, west, water, flowed, toward, the, pacific, across, the, amazonas, basin, as, the, andes, mountains, rose, however, a, large, basin, was, created, that, enclosed, a, lake, now, known, as, the, solim, es, basin, within, the, last, 5, 10, million, years, this, accumulating, water, broke, through, the, purus, arch, joining, the, easterly, flow, toward, the, atlantic, there, is, evidence, that, there, have, been, significant, changes, in, the, amazon, rainforest, vegetation, over, the, last, 21, 000, years, through, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, and, subsequent, deglaciation, analyses, of, sediment, deposits, from, amazon, basin, paleolakes, and, the, amazon, fan, indicate, that, rainfall, in, the, basin, during, the, lgm, was, lower, than, for, the, present, and, this, was, almost, certainly, associated, with, reduced, moist, tropical, vegetation, cover, in, the, basin, in, present, day, the, amazon, receives, approximately, 9, feet, of, rainfall, annually, there, is, a, debate, however, over, how, extensive, this, reduction, was, some, scientists, argue, that, the, rainforest, was, reduced, to, small, isolated, refugia, separated, by, open, forest, and, grassland, other, scientists, argue, that, the, rainforest, remained, largely, intact, but, extended, less, far, to, the, north, south, and, east, than, is, seen, today, this, debate, has, proved, difficult, to, resolve, because, the, practical, limitations, of, working, in, the, rainforest, mean, that, data, sampling, is, biased, away, from, the, center, of, the, amazon, basin, and, both, explanations, are, reasonably, well, supported, by, the, available, data, more, than, 56, of, the, dust, fertilizing, the, amazon, rainforest, comes, from, the, bod, l, depression, in, northern, chad, in, the, sahara, desert, the, dust, contains, phosphorus, important, for, plant, growth, the, yearly, sahara, dust, replaces, the, equivalent, amount, of, phosphorus, washed, away, yearly, in, amazon, soil, from, rains, and, floods, nasa, s, calipso, satellite, has, measured, the, amount, of, dust, transported, by, wind, from, the, sahara, to, the, amazon, an, average, of, 182, million, tons, of, dust, are, windblown, out, of, the, sahara, each, year, at, 15, degrees, west, longitude, across, 2, 600, km, 1, 600, mi, over, the, atlantic, ocean, some, dust, falls, into, the, atlantic, then, at, 35, degrees, west, longitude, at, the, eastern, coast, of, south, america, 27, 7, million, tons, 15, of, dust, fall, over, the, amazon, basin, 22, million, tons, of, it, consisting, of, phosphorus, 132, million, tons, of, dust, remain, in, the, air, 43, million, tons, of, dust, are, windblown, and, falls, on, the, caribbean, sea, past, 75, degrees, west, longitude, calipso, uses, a, laser, range, finder, to, scan, the, earth, s, atmosphere, for, the, vertical, distribution, of, dust, and, other, aerosols, calipso, regularly, tracks, the, sahara, amazon, dust, plume, calipso, has, measured, variations, in, the, dust, amounts, transported, an, 86, percent, drop, between, the, highest, amount, of, dust, transported, in, 2007, and, the, lowest, in, 2011, a, possibility, causing, the, variation, is, the, sahel, a, strip, of, semi, arid, land, on, the, southern, border, of, the, sahara, when, rain, amounts, in, the, sahel, are, higher, the, volume, of, dust, is, lower, the, higher, rainfall, could, make, more, vegetation, grow, in, the, sahel, leaving, less, sand, exposed, to, winds, to, blow, away, amazon, phosphorus, also, comes, as, smoke, due, to, biomass, burning, in, africa, wet, tropical, forests, are, the, most, species, rich, biome, and, tropical, forests, in, the, americas, are, consistently, more, species, rich, than, the, wet, forests, in, africa, and, asia, as, the, largest, tract, of, tropical, rainforest, in, the, americas, the, amazonian, rainforests, have, unparalleled, biodiversity, one, in, ten, known, species, in, the, world, lives, in, the, amazon, rainforest, this, constitutes, the, largest, collection, of, living, plants, and, animal, species, in, the, world, the, region, is, home, to, about, 2, 5, million, insect, species, tens, of, thousands, of, plants, and, some, 2, 000, birds, and, mammals, to, date, at, least, 40, 000, plant, species, 2, 200, fishes, 1, 294, birds, 427, mammals, 428, amphibians, and, 378, reptiles, have, been, scientifically, classified, in, the, region, one, in, five, of, all, bird, species, are, found, in, the, amazon, rainforest, and, one, in, five, of, the, fish, species, live, in, amazonian, rivers, and, streams, scientists, have, described, between, 96, 660, and, 128, 843, invertebrate, species, in, brazil, alone, the, biodiversity, of, plant, species, is, the, highest, on, earth, with, one, 2001, study, finding, a, quarter, square, kilometer, 62, acres, of, ecuadorian, rainforest, supports, more, than, 1, 100, tree, species, a, study, in, 1999, found, one, square, kilometer, 247, acres, of, amazon, rainforest, can, contain, about, 90, 790, tonnes, of, living, plants, the, average, plant, biomass, is, estimated, at, 356, 47, tonnes, per, hectare, to, date, an, estimated, 438, 000, species, of, plants, of, economic, and, social, interest, have, been, registered, in, the, region, with, many, more, remaining, to, be, discovered, or, catalogued, the, total, number, of, tree, species, in, the, region, is, estimated, at, 16, 000, the, green, leaf, area, of, plants, and, trees, in, the, rainforest, varies, by, about, 25, as, a, result, of, seasonal, changes, leaves, expand, during, the, dry, season, when, sunlight, is, at, a, maximum, then, undergo, abscission, in, the, cloudy, wet, season, these, changes, provide, a, balance, of, carbon, between, photosynthesis, and, respiration, each, hectare, of, the, amazon, rainforest, contains, around, 1, billion, of, invertebrates, the, amount, of, species, per, hectare, in, the, amazon, rainforest, can, be, presented, in, the, next, table, the, rainforest, contains, several, species, that, can, pose, a, hazard, among, the, largest, predatory, creatures, are, the, black, caiman, jaguar, cougar, and, anaconda, in, the, river, electric, eels, can, produce, an, electric, shock, that, can, stun, or, kill, while, piranha, are, known, to, bite, and, injure, humans, various, species, of, poison, dart, frogs, secrete, lipophilic, alkaloid, toxins, through, their, flesh, there, are, also, numerous, parasites, and, disease, vectors, vampire, bats, dwell, in, the, rainforest, and, can, spread, the, rabies, virus, malaria, yellow, fever, and, dengue, fever, can, also, be, contracted, in, the, amazon, region, the, biodiversity, in, the, amazon, is, becoming, increasingly, threatened, primarily, by, habitat, loss, from, deforestation, as, well, as, increased, frequency, of, fires, over, 90, of, amazonian, plant, and, vertebrate, species, 13, 000, 14, 000, in, total, may, have, been, impacted, to, some, degree, by, fires, deforestation, is, the, conversion, of, forested, areas, to, non, forested, areas, the, main, sources, of, deforestation, in, the, amazon, are, human, settlement, and, the, development, of, the, land, in, 2022, about, 20, of, the, amazon, rainforest, has, already, been, deforested, and, a, further, 6, was, highly, degraded, research, suggests, that, upon, reaching, about, 20, 25, hence, 0, 5, more, the, tipping, point, to, flip, it, into, a, non, forest, ecosystem, degraded, savannah, in, eastern, southern, and, central, amazonia, will, be, reached, this, process, of, savanisation, would, take, decades, to, take, full, effect, prior, to, the, early, 1960s, access, to, the, forest, s, interior, was, highly, restricted, and, the, forest, remained, basically, intact, farms, established, during, the, 1960s, were, based, on, crop, cultivation, and, the, slash, and, burn, method, however, the, colonists, were, unable, to, manage, their, fields, and, the, crops, because, of, the, loss, of, soil, fertility, and, weed, invasion, the, soils, in, the, amazon, are, productive, for, just, a, short, period, of, time, so, farmers, are, constantly, moving, to, new, areas, and, clearing, more, land, these, farming, practices, led, to, deforestation, and, caused, extensive, environmental, damage, deforestation, is, considerable, and, areas, cleared, of, forest, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, from, outer, space, in, the, 1970s, construction, began, on, the, trans, amazonian, highway, this, highway, represented, a, major, threat, to, the, amazon, rainforest, the, highway, still, has, not, been, completed, limiting, the, environmental, damage, between, 1991, and, 2000, the, total, area, of, forest, lost, in, the, amazon, rose, from, 415, 000, to, 587, 000, km, 2, 160, 000, to, 227, 000, sq, mi, with, most, of, the, lost, forest, becoming, pasture, for, cattle, seventy, percent, of, formerly, forested, land, in, the, amazon, and, 91, of, land, deforested, since, 1970, have, been, used, for, livestock, pasture, currently, brazil, is, the, largest, global, producer, of, soybeans, new, research, however, conducted, by, leydimere, oliveira, et, al, has, shown, that, the, more, rainforest, is, logged, in, the, amazon, the, less, precipitation, reaches, the, area, and, so, the, lower, the, yield, per, hectare, becomes, so, despite, the, popular, perception, there, has, been, no, economical, advantage, for, brazil, from, logging, rainforest, zones, and, converting, these, to, pastoral, fields, the, needs, of, soy, farmers, have, been, used, to, justify, many, of, the, controversial, transportation, projects, that, are, currently, developing, in, the, amazon, the, first, two, highways, successfully, opened, up, the, rainforest, and, led, to, increased, settlement, and, deforestation, the, mean, annual, deforestation, rate, from, 2000, to, 2005, 22, 392, km, 2, or, 8, 646, sq, mi, per, year, was, 18, higher, than, in, the, previous, five, years, 19, 018, km, 2, or, 7, 343, sq, mi, per, year, although, deforestation, declined, significantly, in, the, brazilian, amazon, between, 2004, and, 2014, there, has, been, an, increase, to, the, present, day, brazil, s, president, jair, bolsonaro, has, supported, the, relaxation, of, regulations, placed, on, agricultural, land, he, has, used, his, time, in, office, to, allow, for, more, deforestation, and, more, exploitation, of, the, amazon, s, rich, natural, resources, since, the, discovery, of, fossil, fuel, reservoirs, in, the, amazon, rainforest, oil, drilling, activity, has, steadily, increased, peaking, in, the, western, amazon, in, the, 1970s, and, ushering, another, drilling, boom, in, the, 2000s, oil, companies, have, to, set, up, their, operations, by, opening, new, roads, through, the, forests, which, often, contributes, to, deforestation, in, the, region, 9, 4, of, the, territory, of, the, amazon, is, affected, by, oil, fields, mining, is, also, a, major, driver, of, deforestation, 17, of, the, area, of, the, amazon, rainforest, is, affected, by, mining, the, transition, to, solar, and, wind, energy, digitalization, raised, the, demand, for, cassiterite, the, main, ore, of, tin, used, also, for, financing, gold, mining, manganese, and, copper, which, attracrted, many, illegal, miners, to, the, amazon, this, led, to, deforestation, different, environmental, and, social, problems, hydropower, also, creates, significant, problems, in, the, amazon, such, activities, are, defined, by, the, world, rainforest, movement, as, green, extractivism, the, european, union, mercosur, free, trade, agreement, which, would, form, one, of, the, world, s, largest, free, trade, areas, has, been, denounced, by, environmental, activists, and, indigenous, rights, campaigners, the, fear, is, that, the, deal, could, lead, to, more, deforestation, of, the, amazon, rainforest, as, it, expands, market, access, to, brazilian, beef, according, to, a, november, 2021, report, by, brazil, s, inpe, based, on, satellite, data, deforestation, has, increased, by, 22, over, 2020, and, is, at, its, highest, level, since, 2006, there, were, 72, 843, fires, in, brazil, in, 2019, with, more, than, half, within, the, amazon, region, in, august, 2019, there, were, a, record, number, of, fires, deforestation, in, the, brazilian, amazon, rose, more, than, 88, in, june, 2019, compared, with, the, same, month, in, 2018, the, increased, area, of, fire, impacted, forest, coincided, with, a, relaxation, of, environmental, regulations, from, the, brazilian, government, notably, before, those, regulations, were, put, in, place, in, 2008, the, fire, impacted, area, was, also, larger, compared, to, the, regulation, period, of, 2009, 2018, as, these, fire, continue, to, move, closer, to, the, heart, of, the, amazon, basin, their, impact, on, biodiversity, will, only, increase, in, scale, as, the, cumulative, fire, impacted, area, is, correlated, with, the, number, of, species, impacted, environmentalists, are, concerned, about, loss, of, biodiversity, that, will, result, from, destruction, of, the, forest, and, also, about, the, release, of, the, carbon, contained, within, the, vegetation, which, could, accelerate, global, warming, amazonian, evergreen, forests, account, for, about, 10, of, the, world, s, terrestrial, primary, productivity, and, 10, of, the, carbon, stores, in, ecosystems, of, the, order, of, 1, 1, 10, 11, metric, tonnes, of, carbon, amazonian, forests, are, estimated, to, have, accumulated, 0, 62, 0, 37, tons, of, carbon, per, hectare, per, year, between, 1975, and, 1996, in, 2021, it, was, reported, that, the, amazon, for, the, first, time, emitted, more, greenhouse, gases, than, it, absorbed, though, often, referenced, as, producing, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, earth, s, oxygen, this, often, stated, but, misused, statistic, actually, refers, to, oxygen, turnover, the, net, contribution, of, the, ecosystem, is, approximately, zero, one, computer, model, of, future, climate, change, caused, by, greenhouse, gas, emissions, shows, that, the, amazon, rainforest, could, become, unsustainable, under, conditions, of, severely, reduced, rainfall, and, increased, temperatures, leading, to, an, almost, complete, loss, of, rainforest, cover, in, the, basin, by, 2100, and, severe, economic, natural, capital, and, ecosystem, services, impacts, of, not, averting, the, tipping, point, however, simulations, of, amazon, basin, climate, change, across, many, different, models, are, not, consistent, in, their, estimation, of, any, rainfall, response, ranging, from, weak, increases, to, strong, decreases, the, result, indicates, that, the, rainforest, could, be, threatened, through, the, 21st, century, by, climate, change, in, addition, to, deforestation, in, 1989, environmentalist, c, m, peters, and, two, colleagues, stated, there, is, economic, as, well, as, biological, incentive, to, protecting, the, rainforest, one, hectare, in, the, peruvian, amazon, has, been, calculated, to, have, a, value, of, 6820, if, intact, forest, is, sustainably, harvested, for, fruits, latex, and, timber, 1000, if, clear, cut, for, commercial, timber, not, sustainably, harvested, or, 148, if, used, as, cattle, pasture, as, indigenous, territories, continue, to, be, destroyed, by, deforestation, and, ecocide, such, as, in, the, peruvian, amazon, indigenous, peoples, rainforest, communities, continue, to, disappear, while, others, like, the, urarina, continue, to, struggle, to, fight, for, their, cultural, survival, and, the, fate, of, their, forested, territories, meanwhile, the, relationship, between, non, human, primates, in, the, subsistence, and, symbolism, of, indigenous, lowland, south, american, peoples, has, gained, increased, attention, as, have, ethno, biology, and, community, based, conservation, efforts, from, 2002, to, 2006, the, conserved, land, in, the, amazon, rainforest, almost, tripled, and, deforestation, rates, dropped, up, to, 60, about, 1, 000, 000, km, 2, 250, 000, 000, acres, have, been, put, onto, some, sort, of, conservation, which, adds, up, to, a, current, amount, of, 1, 730, 000, km, 2, 430, 000, 000, acres, in, april, 2019, the, ecuadorian, court, stopped, oil, exploration, activities, in, 180, 000, hectares, 440, 000, acres, of, the, amazon, rainforest, in, july, 2019, the, ecuadorian, court, forbade, the, government, to, sell, territory, with, forests, to, oil, companies, in, september, 2019, the, us, and, brazil, agreed, to, promote, private, sector, development, in, the, amazon, they, also, pledged, a, 100m, biodiversity, conservation, fund, for, the, amazon, led, by, the, private, sector, brazil, s, foreign, minister, stated, that, opening, the, rainforest, to, economic, development, was, the, only, way, to, protect, it, a, 2009, study, found, that, a, 4, c, rise, above, pre, industrial, levels, in, global, temperatures, by, 2100, would, kill, 85, of, the, amazon, rainforest, while, a, temperature, rise, of, 3, c, would, kill, some, 75, of, the, amazon, a, new, study, by, an, international, team, of, environmental, scientists, in, the, brazilian, amazon, shows, that, protection, of, freshwater, biodiversity, can, be, increased, by, up, to, 600, through, integrated, freshwater, terrestrial, planning, deforestation, in, the, amazon, rainforest, region, has, a, negative, impact, on, local, climate, it, was, one, of, the, main, causes, of, the, severe, drought, of, 2014, 2015, in, brazil, this, is, because, the, moisture, from, the, forests, is, important, to, the, rainfall, in, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, half, of, the, rainfall, in, the, amazon, area, is, produced, by, the, forests, results, of, a, 2021, scientific, synthesis, indicate, that, in, terms, of, global, warming, the, amazon, basin, with, the, amazon, rainforest, is, currently, emitting, more, greenhouse, gases, than, it, absorbs, overall, climate, change, impacts, and, human, activities, in, the, area, mainly, wildfires, current, land, use, and, deforestation, are, causing, a, release, of, forcing, agents, that, likely, result, in, a, net, warming, effect, in, 2022, the, supreme, court, of, ecuador, decided, that, under, no, circumstances, can, a, project, be, carried, out, that, generates, excessive, sacrifices, to, the, collective, rights, of, communities, and, nature, it, also, required, the, government, to, respect, the, opinion, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, about, different, industrial, projects, on, their, land, advocates, of, the, decision, argue, that, it, will, have, consequences, far, beyond, ecuador, in, general, ecosystems, are, in, better, shape, when, indigenous, peoples, own, or, manage, the, land, due, to, the, conservation, policies, of, luiz, in, cio, lula, da, silva, in, the, first, 10, months, of, 2023, deforestation, in, the, brazilian, amazon, decreased, by, around, 50, compared, to, the, same, period, in, 2022, this, was, despite, a, severe, drought, one, of, the, worst, on, record, that, exacerbated, the, situation, climate, change, el, nino, deforestation, increases, the, likelihood, of, drought, condition, in, the, amazon, according, to, amazon, conservation, s, maap, forest, monitoring, program, the, deforestation, rate, in, the, amazon, from, the, january, 1, to, november, 8, 2023, decreased, by, 56, in, comparison, to, the, same, period, in, 2022, the, main, cause, is, the, decline, in, deforestation, rate, in, brazil, due, to, the, government, s, policies, while, columbia, peru, and, bolivia, also, reduced, deforestation, in, january, 2024, published, data, showed, a, 50, decline, in, deforestation, rate, in, the, amazon, rainforest, and, 43, rise, in, vegetation, loss, in, the, neighbor, cerrado, during, the, year, of, 2023, in, comparison, to, 2022, both, biomes, together, lose, 12, 980, km, 18, less, than, in, 2022, the, use, of, remotely, sensed, data, is, dramatically, improving, conservationists, knowledge, of, the, amazon, basin, given, the, objectivity, and, lowered, costs, of, satellite, based, land, cover, and, change, analysis, it, appears, likely, that, remote, sensing, technology, will, be, an, integral, part, of, assessing, the, extents, locations, and, damage, of, deforestation, in, the, basin, furthermore, remote, sensing, is, the, best, and, perhaps, only, possible, way, to, study, the, amazon, on, a, large, scale, the, use, of, remote, sensing, for, the, conservation, of, the, amazon, is, also, being, used, by, the, indigenous, tribes, of, the, basin, to, protect, their, tribal, lands, from, commercial, interests, using, handheld, gps, devices, and, programs, like, google, earth, members, of, the, trio, tribe, who, live, in, the, rainforests, of, southern, suriname, map, out, their, ancestral, lands, to, help, strengthen, their, territorial, claims, currently, most, tribes, in, the, amazon, do, not, have, clearly, defined, boundaries, making, it, easier, for, commercial, ventures, to, target, their, territories, to, accurately, map, the, amazon, s, biomass, and, subsequent, carbon, related, emissions, the, classification, of, tree, growth, stages, within, different, parts, of, the, forest, is, crucial, in, 2006, tatiana, kuplich, organized, the, trees, of, the, amazon, into, four, categories, mature, forest, regenerating, forest, regenerating, forest, and, regenerating, forest, the, researcher, used, a, combination, of, synthetic, aperture, radar, sar, and, thematic, mapper, tm, to, accurately, place, the, different, portions, of, the, amazon, into, one, of, the, four, classifications, in, 2005, parts, of, the, amazon, basin, experienced, the, worst, drought, in, one, hundred, years, and, there, were, indications, that, 2006, may, have, been, a, second, successive, year, of, drought, a, 2006, article, in, the, uk, newspaper, the, independent, reported, the, woods, hole, research, center, results, showing, that, the, forest, in, its, present, form, could, survive, only, three, years, of, drought, scientists, at, the, brazilian, national, institute, of, amazonian, research, argued, in, the, article, that, this, drought, response, coupled, with, the, effects, of, deforestation, on, regional, climate, are, pushing, the, rainforest, towards, a, tipping, point, where, it, would, irreversibly, start, to, die, it, concluded, that, the, forest, is, on, the, brink, of, being, turned, into, savanna, or, desert, with, catastrophic, consequences, for, the, world, s, climate, a, study, published, in, nature, communications, in, october, 2020, found, that, about, 40, of, the, amazon, rainforest, is, at, risk, of, becoming, a, savanna, like, ecosystem, due, to, reduced, rainfall, a, study, published, in, nature, climate, change, provided, direct, empirical, evidence, that, more, than, three, quarters, of, the, amazon, rainforest, has, been, losing, resilience, since, the, early, 2000s, risking, dieback, with, profound, implications, for, biodiversity, carbon, storage, and, climate, change, at, a, global, scale, according, to, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, the, combination, of, climate, change, and, deforestation, increases, the, drying, effect, of, dead, trees, that, fuels, forest, fires, in, 2010, the, amazon, rainforest, experienced, another, severe, drought, in, some, ways, more, extreme, than, the, 2005, drought, the, affected, region, was, approximately, 3, 000, 000, km, 2, 1, 160, 000, sq, mi, of, rainforest, compared, with, 1, 900, 000, km, 2, 734, 000, sq, mi, in, 2005, the, 2010, drought, had, three, epicenters, where, vegetation, died, off, whereas, in, 2005, the, drought, was, focused, on, the, southwestern, part, the, findings, were, published, in, the, journal, science, in, a, typical, year, the, amazon, absorbs, 1, 5, gigatons, of, carbon, dioxide, during, 2005, instead, 5, gigatons, were, released, and, in, 2010, 8, gigatons, were, released, additional, severe, droughts, occurred, in, 2010, 2015, and, 2016, in, 2019, brazil, s, protections, of, the, amazon, rainforest, were, slashed, resulting, in, a, severe, loss, of, trees, according, to, brazil, s, national, institute, for, space, research, inpe, deforestation, in, the, brazilian, amazon, rose, more, than, 50, in, the, first, three, months, of, 2020, compared, to, the, same, three, month, period, in, 2019, in, 2020, a, 17, percent, rise, was, noted, in, the, amazon, wildfires, marking, the, worst, start, to, the, fire, season, in, a, decade, the, first, 10, days, of, august, 2020, witnessed, 10, 136, fires, an, analysis, of, the, government, figures, reflected, 81, per, cent, increase, in, fires, in, federal, reserves, in, comparison, with, the, same, period, in, 2019, however, president, jair, bolsonaro, turned, down, the, existence, of, fires, calling, it, a, lie, despite, the, data, produced, by, his, own, government, satellites, in, september, recorded, 32, 017, hotspots, in, the, world, s, largest, rainforest, a, 61, rise, from, the, same, month, in, 2019, in, addition, october, saw, a, huge, surge, in, the, number, of, hotspots, in, the, forest, more, than, 17, 000, fires, are, burning, in, the, amazon, s, rainforest, with, more, than, double, the, amount, detected, in, the, same, month, last, year, in, 2023, the, world, bank, published, a, report, named, a, balancing, act, for, brazil, s, amazonian, states, an, economic, memorandum, the, report, stating, that, economic, losses, due, to, deforestation, in, brazil, could, reach, around, 317, billion, dollars, per, year, approximately, 7, times, higher, in, comparison, to, the, cost, of, all, commodities, produced, through, deforestation, proposed, non, deforestation, based, economic, program, in, the, region, of, the, amazon, rainforest, silvopasture, integrating, trees, forage, and, grazing, can, help, to, stop, deforestation, in, the, region, according, to, wwf, ecotourism, could, help, the, amazon, to, reduce, deforestation, and, climate, change, ecotourism, is, currently, still, little, practiced, in, the, amazon, partly, due, to, lack, of, information, about, places, where, implementation, is, possible, ecotourism, is, a, sector, that, can, also, be, taken, up, by, the, indigenous, community, in, the, amazon, as, a, source, of, income, and, revenue, an, ecotourism, project, in, the, brazilian, section, of, the, rainforest, had, been, under, consideration, by, brazil, s, state, secretary, for, the, environment, and, sustainable, development, in, 2009, along, the, aripuan, river, in, the, aripuan, sustainable, development, reserve, also, some, community, based, ecotourism, exists, in, the, mamirau, sustainable, development, reserve, ecotourism, is, also, practiced, in, the, peruvian, section, of, the, rainforest, a, few, ecolodges, are, for, instance, present, between, cusco, and, madre, de, dios, in, may, 2023, brazil, s, bank, federation, decided, to, implement, a, new, sustainability, standard, demanding, from, meatpackers, to, ensure, their, meat, is, not, coming, from, illegally, deforested, area, credits, will, not, be, given, to, those, who, will, not, meet, the, new, standards, the, decision, came, after, the, european, union, decides, to, implement, regulations, to, stop, deforestation, brazil, beef, exporters, said, the, standard, is, not, just, because, it, is, not, applied, to, land, owners, 21, banks, representing, 81, of, the, credit, market, in, brazil, agree, to, follow, those, rules, according, to, a, statement, of, the, colombian, government, deforestation, rates, in, the, colombian, amazon, fell, by, 70, in, the, first, 9, months, of, 2023, compared, to, the, same, period, in, the, previous, year, what, can, be, attributed, to, the, conservation, policies, of, the, government, one, of, them, is, paying, local, residents, for, conserving, the, forest
