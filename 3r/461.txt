and, a, decline, in, sales, prices, malawi, is, encouraging, farmers, away, from, tobacco, towards, more, profitable, crops, including, spices, such, as, paprika, the, move, away, from, tobacco, is, further, fueled, by, likely, world, health, organisation, moves, against, the, particular, type, of, tobacco, that, malawi, produces, burley, leaf, it, is, seen, to, be, more, harmful, to, human, health, than, other, tobacco, products, india, hemp, is, another, possible, alternative, but, arguments, have, been, made, that, it, will, bring, more, crime, to, the, country, through, its, resemblance, to, varieties, of, cannabis, used, as, a, recreational, drug, and, the, difficulty, in, distinguishing, between, the, two, types, this, concern, is, especially, important, because, the,

of, women, to, effectively, own, and, maintain, the, property, in, comparison, with, their, male, counterparts, the, current, inheritance, rights, in, malawi, are, found, to, be, equal, in, their,

political, structures, due, to, the, presence, of, gatekeepers, which, provide, access, to, the, resources, needed, to, win, elections, and, maintain, seats, in, parliament, this, limited, participation, is, directly, correlated, to, the, limited, positions, which, are, occupied, by, women, in, the, national, setup, this, setup, despite, its, commitment, to, equal, positions, for, men, and, women, has, failed, to, promote, methods, for, female, politicians, maintaining, their, seats, in, parliament, and, as, a, result, of, said, policies, women, throughout, malawi, are, left, without, the, proper, structure, and, resources, to, maintain, their, position, in, the, national, structure, despite, the, limited, resources, available, to, these, female, politicians, the,

despite, the, limited, access, and, resources, widely, available, for, female, politicians, in, malawi, the, state, is, finding, reasonable, success, in, promoting, female, politicians, on, the,
