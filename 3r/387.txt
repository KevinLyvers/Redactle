events, artifacts, north, to, south, events, artifacts, artifacts, mount, pinatubo, is, an, active, stratovolcano, in, the, zambales, mountains, in, luzon, in, the, philippines, located, on, the, tripoint, of, zambales, tarlac, and, pampanga, provinces, most, people, were, unaware, of, its, eruptive, history, before, the, pre, eruption, volcanic, activity, in, early, 1991, dense, forests, which, supported, a, population, of, several, thousand, indigenous, aetas, heavily, eroded, and, obscured, pinatubo, pinatubo, is, known, for, its, vei, 6, eruption, on, june, 15, 1991, the, second, largest, terrestrial, eruption, of, the, 20th, century, after, the, 1912, eruption, of, novarupta, in, alaska, the, eruption, coincided, with, typhoon, yunya, making, landfall, in, the, philippines, which, brought, a, dangerous, mix, of, ash, and, rain, to, nearby, towns, and, cities, early, predictions, led, to, the, evacuation, of, tens, of, thousands, of, people, saving, many, lives, the, eruption, severely, damaged, surrounding, areas, with, pyroclastic, surges, pyroclastic, falls, and, later, flooding, lahars, caused, by, rainwater, re, mobilizing, volcanic, deposits, this, destruction, affected, infrastructure, and, altered, river, systems, for, years, minor, dome, forming, eruptions, inside, the, caldera, continued, from, 1992, to, 1993, the, 1991, eruption, had, worldwide, effects, it, released, roughly, 10, billion, tonnes, 1, 1, 10, 10, short, tons, or, 10, km, 3, 2, 4, cu, mi, of, magma, bringing, large, amounts, of, minerals, and, toxic, metals, to, the, surface, it, also, released, 20, million, tonnes, 22, million, short, tons, of, so, 2, it, ejected, more, particulate, into, the, stratosphere, than, any, eruption, since, krakatoa, in, 1883, in, the, following, months, aerosols, formed, a, global, layer, of, sulfuric, acid, haze, global, temperatures, dropped, by, about, 0, 5, c, 0, 9, f, in, the, years, 1991, 1993, and, ozone, depletion, temporarily, increased, significantly, the, volcano, is, about, 87, kilometers, 54, mi, northwest, of, manila, the, capital, of, the, philippines, near, mount, pinatubo, are, former, military, bases, that, were, maintained, by, the, united, states, the, u, s, naval, base, subic, bay, was, 37, kilometers, 23, mi, south, of, pinatubo, and, the, extent, of, clark, air, base, was, just, 14, kilometers, 8, 7, mi, east, of, the, volcano, s, summit, the, volcano, is, near, to, about, 6, million, people, even, before, the, 1991, eruption, mount, pinatubo, had, little, topographic, prominence, it, was, 1, 745, m, 5, 725, ft, above, sea, level, only, about, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, above, nearby, plains, and, only, about, 200, m, 660, ft, higher, than, surrounding, peaks, which, largely, obscured, it, from, view, it, is, part, of, a, chain, of, volcanoes, which, lie, along, the, western, side, of, the, island, of, luzon, called, the, zambales, mountains, pinatubo, belongs, to, the, cabusilan, sub, range, of, the, zambales, mountains, which, consists, of, mount, cuadrado, mount, negron, mount, mataba, and, mount, pinatubo, they, are, subduction, volcanoes, formed, by, the, eurasian, plate, sliding, under, the, philippine, mobile, belt, along, the, manila, trench, to, the, west, mount, pinatubo, and, the, other, volcanoes, on, this, volcanic, belt, arise, due, to, magmatic, occlusion, from, this, subduction, plate, boundary, pinatubo, is, flanked, on, the, west, by, the, zambales, ophiolite, complex, which, is, an, easterly, dipping, section, of, eocene, oceanic, crust, uplifted, during, the, late, oligocene, the, tarlac, formation, north, east, and, southeast, of, pinatubo, consists, of, marine, nonmarine, and, volcanoclastic, sediments, formed, in, the, late, miocene, and, pliocene, the, most, recent, study, of, mount, pinatubo, before, the, activities, of, 1991, was, the, overall, geological, study, in, 1983, and, 1984, made, by, f, g, delfin, for, the, philippine, national, oil, company, as, part, of, the, surface, investigations, of, the, area, before, exploratory, drilling, and, well, testing, for, geothermal, energy, sources, in, 1988, to, 1990, he, recognized, two, life, histories, of, the, mountain, which, he, classified, as, ancestral, and, modern, pinatubo, activity, of, ancestral, pinatubo, seems, to, have, begun, about, 1, 1, million, years, ago, and, probably, ended, tens, of, thousands, of, years, or, more, before, the, birth, of, modern, pinatubo, much, of, the, rugged, land, around, the, present, volcano, consists, of, remnants, of, ancestral, pinatubo, it, was, an, andesite, and, dacite, stratovolcano, whose, eruptive, activity, was, much, less, explosive, than, modern, pinatubo, its, center, was, roughly, where, the, current, volcano, is, the, projected, height, of, the, mountain, is, up, to, 2, 300, m, 7, 500, ft, or, 1, 43, miles, above, sea, level, if, it, were, a, lone, peak, based, on, a, profile, fitting, to, the, remaining, lower, slopes, or, lower, if, it, had, more, than, one, peak, the, old, volcano, is, exposed, in, the, walls, of, an, old, 3, 5, km, 4, 5, km, 2, 2, mi, 2, 8, mi, wide, caldera, referred, to, as, tayawan, caldera, by, delfin, some, of, the, nearby, peaks, are, the, remnants, of, ancestral, pinatubo, left, behind, when, the, softer, parts, of, the, old, mountain, slopes, were, eroded, by, weathering, ancestral, pinatubo, is, a, somma, volcano, with, modern, pinatubo, as, the, new, cone, mount, dorst, to, the, east, is, part, of, the, dip, slope, of, the, ancestral, pinatubo, several, mountains, near, modern, pinatubo, are, old, satellite, vents, of, ancestral, pinatubo, forming, volcanic, plugs, and, lava, domes, these, satellite, vents, were, probably, active, around, the, same, time, as, the, ancestral, volcano, and, include, the, domes, of, mount, negron, mount, cuadrado, mount, mataba, and, the, bituin, and, tapungho, plugs, later, eruptions, of, modern, pinatubo, occurred, episodically, and, lasted, for, periods, much, shorter, than, the, repose, intervals, between, them, subsequent, eruptions, and, eruptive, period, occurred, about, each, of, these, eruptions, seems, to, have, been, very, large, ejecting, more, than, 10, km, 3, 2, 4, cu, mi, of, material, and, covering, large, parts, of, the, surrounding, areas, with, pyroclastic, flow, deposits, some, eruptive, periods, have, lasted, decades, and, perhaps, as, much, as, several, centuries, and, might, appear, to, include, multiple, large, explosive, eruptions, the, maximum, size, of, eruptions, in, each, eruptive, period, though, has, been, getting, smaller, through, the, more, than, 35, 000, year, history, of, modern, pinatubo, but, this, might, be, an, artifact, of, erosion, and, burial, of, older, deposits, the, oldest, eruption, of, modern, pinatubo, inararo, was, also, its, largest, the, 1991, eruption, was, among, the, smallest, documented, in, its, geologic, record, the, volcano, has, never, grown, very, large, between, eruptions, because, it, produces, mostly, unwelded, easily, erodible, deposits, and, periodically, destroys, the, viscous, domes, that, fill, its, vents, after, the, buag, eruption, c, 1500, ad, the, volcano, lay, dormant, its, slopes, becoming, completely, covered, in, dense, rainforest, and, eroded, into, gullies, and, ravines, the, c, 500, year, repose, though, between, the, buag, and, present, eruptive, periods, is, among, the, shorter, repose, periods, recognized, in, its, geologic, history, a, small, blast, at, 03, 41, pst, on, june, 12, marked, the, beginning, of, a, new, more, violent, phase, of, the, eruption, a, few, hours, later, the, same, day, massive, blasts, lasting, about, half, an, hour, generated, big, eruption, columns, which, quickly, reached, heights, of, over, 19, kilometres, 62, 000, ft, and, which, generated, large, pyroclastic, surges, extending, up, to, four, kilometres, 2, 5, mi, from, the, summit, in, some, river, valleys, fourteen, hours, later, a, 15, minute, blast, hurled, volcanic, matter, to, heights, of, 24, km, 15, mi, friction, in, the, up, rushing, ash, column, generated, abundant, volcanic, lightning, in, march, and, april, 1991, magma, rising, toward, the, surface, from, more, than, 32, km, 20, mi, beneath, pinatubo, triggered, small, volcano, tectonic, earthquakes, and, caused, powerful, steam, explosions, that, blasted, three, craters, on, the, north, flank, of, the, volcano, thousands, of, small, earthquakes, occurred, beneath, pinatubo, through, april, may, and, early, june, and, many, thousand, of, tons, of, noxious, sulfur, dioxide, gas, were, also, emitted, by, the, volcano, from, june, 7, to, 12, the, first, magma, reached, the, surface, of, mount, pinatubo, because, it, had, lost, most, of, the, gas, contained, in, it, on, the, way, to, the, surface, the, magma, oozed, out, to, form, a, lava, dome, but, did, not, cause, an, explosive, eruption, however, on, june, 12, millions, of, cubic, yards, of, gas, charged, magma, reached, the, surface, and, exploded, in, the, reawakening, volcano, s, first, spectacular, eruption, when, even, more, highly, gas, charged, magma, reached, pinatubo, s, surface, on, june, 15, the, volcano, exploded, in, a, cataclysmic, eruption, that, ejected, more, than, 5, km, 3, 1, 2, cu, mi, of, material, the, ash, cloud, from, this, climactic, eruption, rose, 35, km, 22, mi, into, the, atmosphere, at, lower, altitudes, the, volcanic, ash, was, blown, in, all, directions, by, the, intense, cyclonic, winds, of, a, coincidentally, occurring, typhoon, and, winds, at, higher, altitudes, blew, the, ash, southwestward, a, blanket, of, ash, and, larger, pumice, lapilli, blanketed, the, countryside, fine, ash, fell, as, far, away, as, the, indian, ocean, and, satellites, tracked, the, ash, cloud, several, times, around, the, globe, huge, pyroclastic, flows, roared, down, the, flanks, of, mount, pinatubo, filling, once, deep, valleys, with, fresh, volcanic, deposits, as, much, as, 200, m, 660, ft, thick, the, eruption, removed, so, much, magma, and, rock, from, below, the, volcano, that, the, summit, collapsed, to, form, a, 2, 5, km, 1, 6, mi, wide, caldera, following, the, climactic, eruption, of, june, 15, 1991, activity, at, the, volcano, continued, at, a, much, lower, level, with, continuous, ash, eruptions, lasting, until, august, 1991, and, episodic, eruptions, continuing, for, another, month, activity, at, the, volcano, remained, low, until, july, 1992, when, a, new, lava, dome, started, growing, in, the, caldera, volcanologists, suspected, that, further, violent, eruptions, could, be, possible, and, some, areas, were, evacuated, however, the, eruption, was, only, minor, the, last, eruption, of, mount, pinatubo, took, place, in, 1993, the, 1991, caldera, afterwards, filled, with, water, from, annual, monsoon, rains, and, a, crater, lake, lake, pinatubo, was, formed, in, 1992, a, growing, lava, dome, formed, an, island, which, was, eventually, submerged, by, the, lake, initially, the, lake, was, hot, and, highly, acidic, with, a, minimum, ph, of, 2, and, a, temperature, of, about, 40, c, 104, f, subsequent, rainfall, cooled, and, diluted, the, lake, lowering, the, temperature, to, 26, c, 79, f, and, raising, the, ph, to, 5, 5, by, 2003, the, lake, deepened, by, about, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, per, month, on, average, eventually, submerging, the, lava, dome, until, september, 2001, when, fears, that, the, walls, of, the, crater, might, be, unstable, prompted, the, philippine, government, to, order, a, controlled, draining, of, the, lake, an, estimated, 9, 000, people, were, once, again, evacuated, from, surrounding, areas, in, case, a, large, flood, was, accidentally, triggered, workers, cut, a, 5, meter, 16, ft, notch, in, the, crater, rim, and, drained, about, a, quarter, of, the, lake, s, volume, on, july, 10, 2002, the, west, wall, of, the, crater, collapsed, slowly, releasing, approximately, 160, million, cubic, meters, 5, 7, 10, 9, cu, ft, of, water, and, sediment, into, the, maraunot, river, in, botolan, zambales, on, july, 26, 2011, a, 5, 9, magnitude, earthquake, struck, close, to, pinatubo, however, no, major, damages, or, casualties, were, reported, on, march, 4, 2021, the, phivolcs, raised, alert, level, 1, over, mount, pinatubo, after, reporting, an, increase, on, its, seismic, activity, 1, 722, volcanic, earthquakes, were, also, recorded, within, the, vicinity, of, the, volcano, since, january, 2021, on, august, 11, 2021, phivolcs, downgraded, mt, pinatubo, s, alert, level, 1, to, level, 0, due, to, continued, decrease, in, earthquake, activity, and, a, return, to, baseline, seismic, parameters, phivolcs, said, it, noted, a, significant, decrease, in, volcanic, earthquakes, with, a, total, of, 104, quakes, or, an, average, 2, 3, events, per, day, recorded, from, july, 1, august, 1, 2021, on, november, 30, 2021, phivolcs, reported, a, weak, explosion, occurred, on, mt, pinatubo, between, 12, 09, p, m, and, 12, 13, p, m, which, produced, a, plume, the, agency, later, confirmed, it, was, a, phreatic, explosion, produced, by, hydrothermal, fluids, near, the, surface, rather, than, a, magmatic, eruption, the, word, pinatubo, could, mean, fertile, place, where, one, can, make, crops, grow, or, could, mean, made, to, grow, in, sambal, and, tagalog, which, may, suggest, a, knowledge, of, its, previous, eruption, in, about, 1500, ad, there, is, a, local, oral, tradition, suggestive, of, a, folk, memory, of, earlier, large, eruptions, an, ancient, legend, tells, of, bacobaco, a, terrible, spirit, of, the, sea, who, could, metamorphose, into, a, huge, turtle, and, throw, fire, from, his, mouth, in, the, legend, when, being, chased, by, the, spirit, hunters, bacobaco, flees, to, the, mountain, and, digs, a, great, hole, in, its, summit, showering, the, surrounding, land, with, rock, mud, dust, and, fire, for, three, days, howling, so, loudly, that, the, earth, shakes, aeta, elders, tell, many, stories, about, the, history, of, the, mountain, the, best, known, being, that, it, was, once, a, batung, mabye, kapampangan, language, for, living, stone, it, was, said, to, have, been, planted, on, a, kingdom, by, a, displeased, sorcerer, but, relocated, by, a, hero, the, mountain, was, soon, turned, into, the, abode, of, apo, namalyari, the, lord, of, happenings, events, the, pagan, deity, of, the, sambal, aetas, and, kapampangans, living, on, the, zambales, range, it, was, said, to, comprise, the, whole, mountain, range, until, sinukuan, of, mount, arayat, the, god, of, the, kapampangans, became, a, strong, rival, of, namalyari, their, fight, which, took, place, over, the, center, plains, shattered, the, mountain, into, smaller, bodies, and, mount, arayat, lost, its, center, peak, other, versions, have, it, that, pinatubo, s, peak, shattered, because, of, namalyari, s, immense, fury, in, an, attempt, to, teach, humans, the, meaning, of, fear, and, show, how, misdeeds, will, be, punished, according, to, the, native, elders, apo, namalyari, induced, the, june, 1991, eruption, because, of, displeasure, toward, illegal, loggers, and, philippine, national, oil, company, executives, who, performed, deep, exploratory, drilling, and, well, testing, on, the, volcano, looking, for, geothermal, heat, from, 1988, to, 1990, discouraging, results, from, the, wells, forced, the, abandonment, of, the, prospect, 13, months, before, the, april, 2, 1991, explosions, after, being, driven, away, by, the, 1991, eruption, of, mount, pinatubo, in, may, 2009, some, 454, aeta, families, in, pampanga, were, given, the, first, clean, ancestral, land, ownership, on, mount, pinatubo, with, the, certificate, of, ancestral, domain, title, cadt, by, the, national, commission, on, indigenous, peoples, ncip, the, government, agency, that, deals, with, issues, concerning, indigenous, people, of, the, philippines, the, approved, and, declared, net, land, area, of, 7, 440, 1, ha, 18, 385, acres, covers, the, barangays, of, mawakat, and, nabuklod, in, floridablanca, pampanga, plus, a, portion, of, san, marcelino, zambales, and, a, portion, of, barangay, batiawan, in, subic, zambales, on, january, 14, 2010, some, 7, 000, aeta, families, from, zambales, were, officially, granted, the, certificate, of, ancestral, domain, title, cadt, covering, the, zambales, side, of, pinatubo, which, includes, the, summit, and, lake, pinatubo, officially, becoming, their, lutan, tua, ancestral, land, the, ancestral, domain, title, covers, 15, 984, ha, 39, 500, acres, and, includes, the, villages, of, burgos, villar, moraza, and, belbel, in, botolan, and, portions, of, the, towns, of, cabangan, san, felipe, and, san, marcelino, ancestral, domain, titles, are, awarded, to, a, certain, community, or, indigenous, group, who, have, occupied, or, possessed, the, land, continuously, in, accordance, with, their, customs, and, traditions, since, time, immemorial, they, have, the, legal, right, to, collectively, possess, and, to, enjoy, the, land, and, its, natural, resources, to, the, exclusion, of, others, having, the, land, title, will, protect, them, from, others, including, foreigners, exploiting, their, land, without, compensation, to, and, consent, from, the, indigenous, tribes, in, the, past, the, aetas, had, to, contend, with, mining, companies, loggers, and, recently, tourist, companies, who, earn, from, mount, pinatubo, but, do, not, compensate, the, local, tribes, long, before, mount, pinatubo, became, famous, for, its, cataclysmic, eruption, philippine, president, ramon, magsaysay, a, native, of, zambales, named, his, c, 47, presidential, plane, mt, pinatubo, the, plane, crashed, into, mount, manunggal, in, cebu, province, in, 1957, killing, the, president, and, twenty, four, others, on, board, the, shape, of, mount, pinatubo, s, caldera, inspired, new, clark, city, athletics, stadium, in, capas, tarlac, the, caldera, formed, and, lake, pinatubo, has, since, june, 15, 1991, become, a, tourist, attraction, with, the, preferred, route, through, barangay, santa, juliana, in, capas, tarlac
