mention, of, fortification, at, this, stage, aden, was, more, an, island, than, a, peninsula, as, the, isthmus, a, tombolo, was, not, then, so, developed, as, it, is, today, aden, was, explicitly, mentioned, by, this, name, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, which, talks, about, jerusalem, and, it, says, the, merchants, of, sheba, and, raamah, are, your, merchants, they, set, up, your, markets, with, the, finest, perfumes, and, every, precious, stone, and, gold, harran, qena, and, aden, are, the, merchants, of, sheba, and, assyria, and, kilmud, are, your, merchants, at, its, beginning, the, city, was, a, small, peninsula, with, no, significant, natural, resources, but, its, location, between, egypt, and, india, made, it, important, in, the, ancient, global, trade, route, the, city, was, the, home, of, the, ancient, kingdom, of, osan, from, the, eighth, to, seventh, centuries, bc, in, the, beginning, of, the, seventh, century, bc, karbil, watar, i, king, of, the, kingdom, of, sheba, launched, a, campaign, against, osan, during, which, according, to, the, sabaean, texts, sixteen, thousand, people, were, killed, forty, thousand, people, were, enslaved, and, the, kings, of, awsan, made, offerings, to, the, god, al, maqah, according, to, the, inscription, that, karbiel, watar, i, left, in, sirwah, commemorating, his, victory, in, the, second, half, of, the, first, century, bc, the, roman, emperor, augustus, caesar, determined, to, control, arabia, felix, and, reach, the, indian, ocean, the, roman, governor, of, egypt, aelius, gallus, was, sent, in, 25, bc, the, campaign, ended, with, disastrous, results, and, the, annihilation, of, the, roman, army, in, front, of, the, walls, of, ma, rib, the, himyarites, overthrew, the, kingdom, of, sheba, in, 275, ad, and, took, control, of, aden, recent, incomplete, archaeological, studies, suggest, that, the, himyarites, were, the, ones, who, built, the, huge, water, cisterns, currently, known, as, the, cisterns, of, aden, which, stored, approximately, 136, 382, 757, liters, of, water, the, himyarite, kingdom, fell, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, sixth, century, ad, yusuf, dhu, nuwas, mentioned, bab, al, mandab, in, one, of, his, writings, the, forces, of, the, kingdom, of, aksum, were, entering, yemen, through, it, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, sent, a, fleet, to, fight, the, himyarite, jews, and, support, the, kingdom, of, aksum, and, the, christians, of, najran, the, fleet, entered, through, aden, byzantine, sources, indicate, that, the, sasanian, empire, took, control, of, the, city, in, 671, ad, a, local, legend, in, yemen, states, that, aden, may, be, as, old, as, human, history, itself, some, also, believe, that, cain, and, abel, are, buried, somewhere, in, the, city, although, the, pre, islamic, himyar, civilization, was, capable, of, building, large, structures, there, seems, to, have, been, little, fortification, at, this, stage, fortifications, at, mareb, and, other, places, in, yemen, and, the, hadhramaut, make, it, clear, that, both, the, himyar, and, the, sabean, cultures, were, well, capable, of, it, thus, watchtowers, since, destroyed, are, possible, however, the, arab, historians, ibn, al, mujawir, and, abu, makhramah, attribute, the, first, fortification, of, aden, to, beni, zuree, a, abu, makhramah, has, also, included, a, detailed, biography, of, muhammad, azim, sultan, qamarbandi, naqsh, in, his, work, tarikh, ul, yemen, the, aim, seems, to, have, been, twofold, to, keep, hostile, forces, out, and, to, maintain, revenue, by, controlling, the, movement, of, goods, thereby, preventing, smuggling, in, its, original, form, some, of, this, work, was, relatively, feeble, with, the, introduction, of, islam, to, yemen, in, the, seventh, century, ad, aden, experienced, a, period, of, stagnation, that, lasted, until, the, ninth, century, ad, in, the, early, years, of, islam, aden, belonged, to, the, province, of, jund, taiz, it, was, controlled, by, the, state, of, ziyadid, and, the, sulayhid, after, the, death, of, ali, bin, muhammad, al, sulayhi, his, son, took, charge, of, zurayids, and, aden, continued, to, pay, the, annual, royalty, until, queen, arwa, bint, ahmed, al, sulayhi, reduced, it, after, the, fall, of, the, sulayhid, state, the, banu, zurayi, became, independent, in, aden, taking, advantage, of, the, sulayhids, preoccupation, with, the, khawlan, tribes, the, zurayites, continued, to, rule, aden, lahj, and, abyan, for, less, than, forty, years, until, they, fell, under, the, ayyubids, control, of, the, city, a, major, battle, took, place, between, turan, shah, bin, ayyub, and, yasser, bin, bilal, al, muhammadi, minister, of, state, and, the, zurayiyyah, were, defeated, and, al, muhammadi, fled, to, taiz, one, of, the, most, important, reasons, that, contributed, to, the, defeat, of, the, zurayids, was, their, ongoing, wars, with, the, bani, mahdi, in, tihama, and, the, departure, of, their, army, to, confront, the, ayyubids, instead, of, fortifying, themselves, in, aden, after, 1175, rebuilding, in, a, more, solid, form, began, and, ever, since, aden, became, a, popular, city, attracting, sailors, and, merchants, from, egypt, sindh, gujarat, east, africa, and, even, china, according, to, muqaddasi, persians, formed, the, majority, of, aden, s, population, in, the, 10th, century, during, the, ayyubid, period, in, yemen, sana, a, and, its, environs, were, more, hostile, to, their, presence, than, other, regions, the, zaidi, tribes, were, able, to, defeat, the, ayyubids, in, 1226, but, omar, bin, rasul, the, founder, of, the, rasulid, state, was, able, to, repel, them, so, he, tightened, his, control, over, aden, the, city, regained, its, position, during, the, days, of, the, rasulids, so, they, dug, wells, and, built, schools, and, aden, flourished, commercially, the, kings, of, bani, rasul, were, also, merchants, and, enacted, a, number, of, laws, and, regulations, to, codify, trade, in, the, city, the, banu, tahir, were, able, to, control, aden, after, the, banu, rasool, and, the, italian, traveler, lodovico, di, verthama, describes, it, as, one, of, the, most, powerful, cities, seen, on, earth, during, the, days, of, the, tahirids, the, portuguese, began, expanding, into, the, indian, ocean, and, by, 1498, they, realized, that, aden, was, their, key, to, entering, the, red, sea, the, mamluks, in, egypt, sensed, the, danger, and, sent, a, force, led, by, hussein, al, kurdi, the, victorious, king, amer, bin, abdul, wahhab, provided, great, aid, to, the, kurds, but, he, suffered, a, heavy, defeat, in, the, battle, of, diu, the, mamluks, sent, a, second, fleet, but, the, victorious, king, refused, to, cooperate, with, the, mamluks, because, he, had, succeeded, in, repelling, the, portuguese, from, aden, without, their, help, hussein, al, kurdi, became, angry, and, allied, with, the, zaidi, imam, who, was, opposed, to, the, tahirids, al, mutawakkil, sharaf, al, din, and, the, tahirid, cities, fell, successively, with, the, exception, of, aden, the, ottoman, empire, took, control, of, the, city, in, 1538, the, ottomans, goal, was, to, prevent, the, portuguese, from, controlling, aden, so, the, city, witnessed, difficult, days, in, addition, to, the, fact, that, the, port, of, mocha, gained, greater, importance, at, the, expense, of, aden, during, the, sixteenth, century, the, city, s, population, declined, and, it, turned, into, a, small, village, with, a, population, of, no, more, than, 600, people, while, its, population, was, approximately, eighty, thousand, people, during, the, days, of, the, rasulid, state, in, 1421, china, s, ming, dynasty, yongle, emperor, ordered, principal, envoy, grand, eunuch, li, xing, and, grand, eunuch, zhou, man, of, zheng, he, s, fleet, to, convey, an, imperial, edict, with, hats, and, robes, to, bestow, on, the, king, of, aden, the, envoys, boarded, three, treasure, ships, and, set, sail, from, sumatra, to, the, port, of, aden, this, event, was, recorded, in, the, book, yingyai, shenglan, by, ma, huan, who, accompanied, the, imperial, envoy, in, 1513, the, portuguese, led, by, afonso, de, albuquerque, launched, an, unsuccessful, four, day, naval, siege, of, aden, after, ottoman, rule, aden, was, ruled, by, the, sultanate, of, lahej, under, suzerainty, of, the, zaidi, imams, of, yemen, the, first, political, intercourse, between, lahej, and, the, british, took, place, in, 1799, when, a, naval, force, was, sent, from, great, britain, with, a, detachment, of, troops, from, india, to, occupy, the, island, of, perim, and, prevent, all, communication, of, the, french, in, egypt, with, the, indian, ocean, by, way, of, the, red, sea, the, island, of, perim, was, found, unsuitable, for, troops, and, the, sultan, of, lahej, ahmed, bin, abdul, karim, received, the, detachment, for, some, time, at, aden, he, proposed, to, enter, into, an, alliance, and, to, grant, aden, as, a, permanent, station, but, the, offer, was, declined, a, treaty, was, however, concluded, with, the, sultan, in, 1802, by, admiral, sir, home, popham, who, was, instructed, to, enter, into, political, and, commercial, alliances, with, the, chiefs, oil, the, arabian, coast, of, the, red, sea, the, situation, was, different, in, the, north, of, the, country, where, the, zaidis, did, not, recognize, the, authority, of, the, ottomans, and, revolted, against, them, many, times, the, most, recent, of, which, was, the, revolution, of, imam, al, mansur, billah, al, qasim, bin, muhammad, bin, al, qasim, who, and, his, son, al, mu, ayyad, billah, muhammad, were, able, to, unite, the, tribes, and, expel, the, ottomans, the, imams, relied, on, the, revenues, from, the, port, of, mocha, and, aden, was, not, as, important, as, the, abadlahs, were, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, sultan, fadl, al, abdali, concluded, an, alliance, with, the, yafi, tribes, to, rebel, against, the, zaidi, imams, and, monopolize, aden, s, revenues, equally, among, them, the, sultan, of, lahej, got, rid, of, the, imams, but, he, did, not, fulfill, his, promise, to, yafa, the, zaidi, imams, did, not, recognize, inheritance, and, saw, fighting, for, the, imamate, so, the, war, between, al, nasir, muhammad, bin, ishaq, and, al, mansur, al, hussein, bin, al, mutawakkil, prolonged, so, al, abdali, took, the, opportunity, to, declare, his, independence, in, lahej, and, aden, the, english, had, been, visiting, aden, and, mocha, from, 1609, led, by, sir, henry, middleton, who, was, imprisoned, his, ships, confiscated, and, eight, of, his, men, killed, the, british, tried, to, conclude, treaties, with, the, zaidi, imams, after, the, ottomans, were, expelled, from, aden, they, visited, sana, a, and, mokha, but, they, treated, the, british, ambassador, poorly, and, rejected, his, offer, things, were, different, when, the, abdali, gained, independence, from, lahj, and, medina, they, signed, a, treaty, with, the, british, in, 1802, stipulating, that, they, build, a, factory, in, crater, and, allocate, a, special, cemetery, for, english, subjects, free, of, charge, the, abdali, wanted, english, protection, from, the, tribes, sultan, fadl, bin, ali, was, killed, by, yafi, gunmen, then, one, of, the, sheikhs, of, al, hujariya, invaded, lahj, and, besieged, it, for, five, months, al, awaliq, also, besieged, it, with, eight, thousand, fighters, and, they, did, not, leave, until, sultan, ahmed, bin, abdul, karim, paid, them, seven, thousand, dollars, then, the, fadl, family, attacked, aden, in, 1836, in, 1609, the, ascension, was, the, first, english, ship, to, visit, aden, before, sailing, on, to, mocha, during, the, fourth, voyage, of, the, east,

the, sultan, the, french, were, defeated, in, egypt, in, 1801, and, their, privateers, were, tracked, down, over, the, subsequent, decade, by, 1800, aden, was, a, small, village, with, a, population, of, 600, arabs, somalis, jews, and, indians, housed, for, the, most, part, in, huts, of, reed, matting, erected, among, ruins, recalling, a, vanished, era, of, wealth, and, prosperity, as, there, was, little, british, trade, in, the, red, sea, most, british, politicians, until, the, 1830s, had, no, further, interest, in, the, area, beyond, the, suppression, of, piracy, however, a, small, number, of, government, officials, and, the, east, india, company, officials, thought, that, a, british, base, in, the, area, was, necessary, to, prevent, another, french, advance, through, egypt, or, russian, expansion, through, persia, the, emergence, of, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, as, a, strong, local, ruler, only, increased, their, concerns, the, governor, of, bombay, from, 1834, to, 1838, sir, robert, grant, was, one, of, those, who, believed, that, india, could, only, be, protected, by, preemptively, seizing, places, of, strength, to, protect, the, indian, ocean, the, red, sea, increased, in, importance, after, the, steamship, hugh, lindsay, sailed, from, bombay, to, the, suez, isthmus, in, 1830, stopping, at, aden, with, the, sultan, s, consent, to, resupply, with, coal, although, cargo, was, still, carried, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, sailing, ships, a, steam, route, to, the, suez, could, provide, a, much, quicker, option, for, transporting, officials, and, important, communications, grant, felt, that, armed, ships, steaming, regularly, between, bombay, and, suez, would, help, secure, british, interests, in, the, region, and, did, all, he, could, to, progress, his, vision, after, lengthy, negotiations, due, to, the, costs, of, investing, in, the, new, technology, the, government, agreed, to, pay, half, the, costs, for, six, voyages, per, year, and, the, east, india, company, board, approved, the, purchase, of, two, new, steamers, in, 1837, grant, immediately, announced, that, monthly, voyages, to, suez, would, take, place, despite, the,

particularly, water, were, replenished, so, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, became, necessary, to, replenish, coal, and, boiler, water, thus, aden, acquired, a, coaling, station, at, steamer, point, and, aden, was, to, remain, under, british, control, until, november, 1967, until, 1937, aden, was, governed, as, part, of, british, india, and, was, known, as, the, aden, settlement, its, original, territory, was, enlarged, in, 1857, by, the, 13, km, 2, 5, 0, sq, mi, island, of, perim, in, 1868, by, the, 73, km, 2, 28, sq, mi, khuriya, muriya, islands, and, in, 1915, by, the, 108, km, 2, 42, sq,
