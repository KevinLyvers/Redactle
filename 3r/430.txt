the, phoenix, islands, protected, area, pipa, is, located, in, the, republic, of, kiribati, an, ocean, nation, in, the, central, pacific, approximately, midway, between, australia, and, hawaii, pipa, constitutes, 11, 34, of, kiribati, s, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, and, with, a, size, of, 408, 250, km, 2, 157, 630, sq, mi, it, is, one, of, the, largest, marine, protected, areas, mpa, and, one, of, the, largest, protected, areas, of, any, type, land, or, sea, on, earth, the, pipa, was, also, designated, as, the, world, s, largest, and, deepest, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2010, the, pipa, conserves, one, of, the, world, s, largest, intact, oceanic, coral, archipelago, ecosystems, includes, 14, known, underwater, seamounts, presumed, to, be, extinct, volcanoes, and, other, deep, sea, habitats, the, area, contains, approximately, 800, known, species, of, fauna, including, about, 200, coral, species, 500, fish, species, 18, marine, mammals, and, 44, bird, species, in, total, it, is, equivalent, to, the, size, of, the, state, of, california, in, the, us, though, the, total, land, area, is, only, 25, km, 2, 9, 7, sq, mi, to, the, north, of, the, pipa, is, the, u, s, administered, pacific, remote, islands, marine, national, monument, that, is, currently, the, world, s, largest, designated, mpa, the, republic, of, kiribati, in, partnership, with, the, non, governmental, conservation, organizations, conservation, international, and, the, new, england, aquarium, has, formed, the, phoenix, island, protected, area, conservation, trust, pipa, trust, in, 2018, the, new, england, aquarium, resigned, as, a, partner, and, the, aquarium, of, the, pacific, joined, the, pipa, trust, board, management, and, protection, requirements, necessary, to, maintain, the, values, of, this, mpa, are, reflected, both, in, the, current, interim, management, measures, and, the, recently, approved, management, plan, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, following, the, administrators, of, the, reserve, had, been, criticized, for, the, amount, of, fishing, they, allowed, prior, to, full, closure, on, january, 1, 2015, as, of, jan, 1, 2015, all, commercial, extractive, activities, including, tuna, fishing, are, prohibited, throughout, the, mpa, only, a, small, sustainable, use, zone, around, canton, island, allows, for, limited, activities, to, support, the, resident, population, in, the, pipa, management, plan, 2015, 2020, which, was, implemented, following, a, kiribati, government, decision, in, january, 2014, there, is, a, total, ban, on, commercial, fishing, within, the, pipa, boundaries, the, territorial, sea, to, 12, nm, and, all, lagoons, of, the, 8, pipa, islands, kanton, manra, rawaki, birnie, mckean, enderbury, nikumaroro, and, orona, to, ensure, there, is, no, impact, to, marine, and, terrestrial, species, including, habitats, in, november, 2021, it, was, announced, that, kiribati, government, will, terminate, the, protected, area, to, boost, tuna, fishing, there, are, three, atolls, with, associated, lagoons, and, perimeter, coral, reefs, in, the, pipa, orona, hull, nikumaroro, gardner, and, kanton, aba, riringa, and, five, low, islands, surrounded, by, fringing, reefs, manra, sydney, rawaki, phoenix, mckean, birnie, and, enderbury, and, also, two, submerged, reefs, winslow, and, carondelet, the, area, contains, seven, main, habitats, island, lagoon, coral, reef, deep, reef, sea, mount, deep, benthos, and, open, ocean, which, are, all, represented, within, the, protected, zone, the, 2000, surveys, obura, et, al, in, the, phoenix, islands, orona, hull, nikumaroro, gardner, and, kanton, aba, riringa, five, low, reef, islands, surrounded, by, coral, reefs, manra, sydney, rawaki, phoenix, mckean, and, enderbury, identify, that, at, the, time, of, these, surveys, the, reefs, were, in, an, excellent, state, of, health, and, free, from, the, bleaching, that, has, plagued, reefs, in, other, parts, of, the, pacific, with, no, evidence, of, any, coral, diseases, the, coral, reefs, of, the, phoenix, islands, were, notable, for, their, moderate, live, coral, cover, lcc, of, 20, 40, and, evidence, of, high, physical, breakage, of, coral, by, wave, energy, on, the, southern, eastern, and, northern, reefs, of, the, islands, which, create, coral, rubble, in, the, lagoons, and, base, of, the, reefs, the, dominant, bottom, cover, of, the, lagoons, was, hard, coral, 36, 0, followed, by, coralline, algae, red, algae, 18, 0, coral, rubble, 16, 7, turf, and, fleshy, algae, 11, 6, and, halimeda, green, macroalgae, 10, 4, the, dominance, of, coral, and, coralline, algae, indicates, healthy, reef, ecosystems, dominated, by, calcifying, organisms, and, active, reef, framework, growth, the, effect, of, exposure, to, storms, is, indicated, by, the, dominance, trends, with, storm, resistant, encrusting, submassive, forms, in, windward, sites, its, somewhat, lower, abundance, at, leeward, sites, and, a, corresponding, increase, in, more, delicate, plate, forms, and, the, dominance, of, the, more, fragile, table, and, staghorn, corals, in, protected, lagoon, sites, coral, species, diversity, is, higher, on, the, larger, islands, of, nikumaroro, kanton, and, orona, which, indicates, the, importance, of, the, larger, area, of, reef, on, these, islands, for, support, of, biodiversity, carpeting, soft, corals, sinularia, and, lobophytum, were, found, at, the, bottom, of, the, lagoons, of, kanton, and, orona, which, are, the, only, true, lagoons, in, the, phoenix, islands, crown, of, thorns, starfish, acanthaster, planci, cushion, star, and, other, coral, predators, such, as, the, corallivorous, snail, drupella, spp, are, found, on, the, reefs, of, the, phoenix, islands, although, there, has, not, been, any, indication, of, destructive, outbreaks, of, those, predators, on, the, reefs, species, of, giant, clam, tridacna, occur, in, low, numbers, tridacna, squamosa, tridacna, maxima, but, not, tridacna, gigas, two, submerged, reefs, winslow, and, carondelet, and, at, least, 14, known, seamounts, together, with, open, ocean, and, deep, sea, habitat, are, an, integral, part, of, the, phoenix, islands, protected, area, pipa, the, new, england, aquarium, neaq, boston, university, bu, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, sea, education, association, sea, and, schmidt, ocean, institute, have, carried, out, scientific, research, expeditions, of, these, seamount, habitats, which, have, been, identified, being, rich, in, deep, water, coral, and, biodiversity, supporting, a, variety, of, oceanic, pelagic, species, pipa, has, been, identified, as, an, important, feeding, and, spawning, site, for, the, tuna, species, the, dominant, taxonomic, group, in, the, deep, sea, across, all, depths, were, the, octocorals, followed, by, antipatharians, scleractinians, and, then, zoantharians, the, pipa, is, in, a, naturally, iron, poor, region, the, introduction, of, iron, to, this, environment, from, shipwrecks, and, anchor, gear, is, linked, to, proliferation, of, turf, algae, and, benthic, bacterial, communities, and, degraded, black, reefs, monitoring, from, 2000, to, 2015, recorded, the, black, reef, originating, at, the, 1929, wreck, of, the, ss, norwich, city, on, nikumaroro, progressing, northward, to, sites, 1, kilometre, 0, 6, mi, away, the, 2015, expedition, to, the, pipa, recorded, the, presence, of, black, reefs, on, five, atolls, enderbury, kanton, nikumaroro, mckean, rawaki, and, on, carondelet, seamount, associated, with, shipwreck, debris, no, recovery, has, been, documented, at, black, reefs, observed, between, 2005, and, 2015, five, of, the, eight, islands, in, pipa, are, currently, designated, as, important, bird, areas, by, birdlife, international, today, there, are, 19, species, of, seabirds, living, on, the, islands, many, other, seabirds, migrate, through, pipa, including, shearwaters, and, mottled, petrels, from, australia, and, new, zealand, prominent, species, include, the, endemic, endangered, phoenix, petrel, some, of, the, negative, impacts, of, the, introduction, of, non, native, invasive, plants, and, animals, include, the, elimination, of, native, seabirds, and, plants, particularly, through, the, destruction, of, the, eggs, and, young, and, introduced, plants, taking, over, other, plant, life, modifying, the, natural, island, ecosystem, plants, and, animals, that, have, been, introduced, over, time, include, pacific, and, asian, rats, rabbits, cats, ants, pigs, dogs, and, lantana, until, pipa, was, declared, the, last, comprehensive, fauna, surveys, of, the, phoenix, islands, occurred, in, the, 1960s, in, 2006, a, new, survey, was, conducted, to, determine, the, extent, of, non, native, pest, species, invasions, on, each, island, and, the, feasibility, of, a, restoration, program, from, this, work, it, was, determined, that, pests, especially, the, feral, rabbits, on, rawaki, island, and, asian, rats, on, mckean, island, should, be, removed, from, the, phoenix, islands, sometime, around, the, year, 2002, asian, rats, colonized, mckean, apparently, when, a, fishing, trawler, was, wrecked, on, the, island, the, 2006, survey, found, that, rat, predation, had, virtually, destroyed, the, once, abundant, populations, of, storm, petrels, blue, noddles, and, other, petrels, and, shearwaters, rabbits, on, rawaki, were, competing, for, and, generally, damaging, necessary, resources, for, the, birds, as, well, as, trampling, nests, as, a, first, step, towards, biodiversity, recovery, on, the, islands, of, the, pipa, in, mid, 2008, rats, and, rabbits, were, targeted, on, mckean, and, rawaki, in, november, december, 2009, a, check, of, these, islands, by, a, science, team, indicated, that, the, eradication, programs, were, successful, the, responses, from, the, plant, life, and, bird, life, were, spectacular, with, the, team, finding, that, seabirds, were, nesting, successfully, on, mckean, for, the, first, time, in, nearly, 10, years, meanwhile, on, rawaki, the, vegetation, recovery, has, enabled, birds, like, blue, noddies, to, find, suitable, nest, sites, throughout, the, island, even, frigatebirds, were, nesting, on, the, now, recovering, plants, these, restoration, efforts, will, enable, populations, of, phoenix, petrel, white, throated, storm, petrel, and, other, important, seabird, populations, to, recover, in, the, pipa, a, second, eradication, expedition, was, successfully, executed, in, july, 2011, with, two, additional, islands, of, the, pipa, enderbury, and, birnie, targeted, for, pest, removal, both, islands, had, populations, of, the, non, native, pacific, rat, on, january, 30, 2009, the, republic, of, kiribati, submitted, an, application, for, the, phoenix, islands, protected, area, for, consideration, on, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, unesco, world, heritage, list, this, was, the, first, nomination, submitted, by, kiribati, since, they, ratified, the, convention, in, 2000, on, august, 1, 2010, at, the, 34th, session, of, the, world, heritage, committee, in, bras, lia, brazil, the, decision, was, made, to, inscribe, pipa, onto, the, world, heritage, list, it, became, the, largest, and, deepest, world, heritage, site, in, the, world, 3, 38, 59, s, 172, 51, 27, w, 3, 64972, s, 172, 85750, w, 3, 64972, 172, 85750
