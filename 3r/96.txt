lake, chad, arabic, kanuri, s, d, french, lac, tchad, is, an, endorheic, freshwater, lake, located, at, the, junction, of, four, countries, nigeria, niger, chad, and, cameroon, in, western, and, central, africa, respectively, with, a, catchment, area, in, excess, of, 1, 000, 000, km, 2, 390, 000, sq, mi, it, is, an, important, wetland, ecosystem, in, west, central, africa, the, lakeside, is, rich, in, reeds, and, swamps, and, the, plain, along, the, lake, is, fertile, making, it, an, important, irrigated, agricultural, area, the, lake, is, rich, in, aquatic, resources, and, is, one, of, the, important, freshwater, fish, producing, areas, in, africa, lake, chad, is, divided, into, deeper, southern, parts, and, shallower, northern, parts, the, water, source, of, the, lake, mainly, comes, from, rivers, such, as, the, chari, river, that, enter, the, lake, the, water, level, varies, greatly, seasonally, and, the, area, of, the, lake, also, changes, dramatically, during, the, african, humid, period, the, area, of, lake, chad, reached, 400, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, due, to, the, increasingly, arid, climate, the, lake, surface, gradually, shrank, in, the, 19th, century, lake, chad, still, had, an, area, of, 28, 000, km, 2, 11, 000, sq, mi, however, due, to, climate, change, and, human, water, diversion, lake, chad, has, been, greatly, reduced, since, the, mid, 1970s, and, its, area, has, fluctuated, between, 2, 000, and, 5, 000, km, 2, 770, and, 1, 930, sq, mi, the, chad, basin, was, formed, by, the, depression, of, the, african, shield, the, floor, of, the, basin, is, made, of, precambrian, bedrock, covered, by, more, than, 3, 600, m, 11, 800, ft, of, sedimentary, deposits, for, most, of, the, quaternary, the, basin, had, abundant, water, sources, towards, the, end, of, this, period, the, climate, became, drier, around, 20, 000, 40, 000, years, ago, eolianite, sand, dunes, began, to, form, in, the, north, of, the, basin, the, area, of, lake, chad, experienced, four, heydays, between, 39, 000, bc, and, 300, bc, leaving, thick, diatomaceous, earth, and, lacustrine, deposits, in, the, strata, this, has, been, called, mega, chad, the, maximum, depth, of, mega, chad, exceeds, 180, m, 590, ft, 7, in, and, covers, an, area, of, approximately, 400, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, flowed, into, the, benue, river, through, the, mayo, k, bbi, and, finally, flows, into, the, atlantic, ocean, through, the, niger, river, the, vast, waters, formed, during, the, african, humid, period, provided, conditions, for, the, emergence, of, lakeside, fishermen, s, settlements, and, the, nilo, saharan, ethnic, group, also, migrated, to, lake, chad, during, this, period, agriculture, also, emerged, in, the, sahel, region, at, this, time, by, 1800, bc, a, pottery, culture, known, as, gajiganna, had, emerged, initially, as, pastoralists, but, starting, around, 1500, bc, living, in, settled, hamlets, at, the, side, of, the, lake, the, archaeological, discovery, revealed, wild, grasses, mostly, of, the, tribe, paniceae, and, wild, rice, together, with, the, earliest, domesticated, pearl, millet, in, the, lake, chad, region, dating, to, 1200, 1000, cal, bc, one, of, the, oldest, domesticated, pearl, millet, in, west, africa, was, found, in, the, chad, basin, charred, together, with, wild, grasses, and, their, era, can, be, traced, back, to, 800, 1000, cal, bc, permanent, villages, were, established, to, the, south, of, the, lake, by, 500, bc, and, major, archaeological, discoveries, include, the, sao, civilization, according, to, the, records, of, claudius, ptolemy, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, ad, the, romans, of, the, 1st, century, ad, had, already, come, into, contact, with, lake, chad, through, their, connections, with, tunisia, tripolitania, and, fezzan, by, the, 5th, century, ad, camels, were, being, used, for, trans, saharan, trade, via, the, fezzan, or, to, the, east, via, darfur, after, the, arabs, conquered, north, africa, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, the, chad, basin, became, increasingly, linked, to, the, muslim, countries, trade, and, improved, agricultural, techniques, enabled, more, sophisticated, societies, around, 900, ad, the, kanem, people, who, spoke, the, kanuri, language, unified, numerous, nomadic, tribes, and, established, the, kanem, empire, in, the, northeast, of, lake, chad, at, the, beginning, of, the, founding, of, the, country, the, kanem, people, continued, to, live, a, nomadic, life, until, the, 11th, century, when, they, were, islamized, and, settled, in, njimi, through, trans, saharan, trade, the, power, of, the, kanem, empire, reached, its, peak, in, the, 13th, century, but, as, the, empire, declined, in, the, 14th, century, its, southwestern, vassal, state, of, bornu, began, to, rise, causing, the, power, center, of, the, empire, to, shift, to, bornu, around, 1400, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, bornu, empire, began, importing, firearms, from, north, africa, consolidating, its, military, hegemony, the, bornu, empire, declined, in, the, 18th, century, and, later, lost, its, western, region, to, the, sokoto, caliphate, during, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, later, colonised, by, european, powers, in, the, 20th, century, following, the, growing, interest, in, africa, among, european, academic, and, business, communities, the, lake, chad, area, was, extensively, described, by, europeans, in, the, 19th, century, three, scientific, expeditions, were, conducted, between, 1898, and, 1909, during, the, berlin, conference, in, 1884, 1885, africa, was, divided, between, the, european, colonial, powers, by, the, second, decade, of, the, 20th, century, lake, chad, had, been, colonized, and, occupied, by, britain, france, and, germany, defining, boundaries, that, are, largely, intact, with, the, present, post, colonial, states, at, the, beginning, of, independence, the, countries, surrounding, lake, chad, not, only, had, a, poor, economic, foundation, but, also, had, more, complex, ethnic, religious, and, political, conflicts, nigeria, and, niger, which, had, just, gained, independence, experienced, continuous, coups, while, chad, also, experienced, ongoing, civil, war, the, inability, of, countries, along, the, lake, to, consider, the, protection, of, lake, chad, has, led, to, a, series, of, environmental, problems, the, chad, basin, includes, chad, nigeria, cameroon, niger, sudan, and, the, central, african, republic, it, is, an, extensional, fault, depression, type, rift, basin, which, can, be, divided, into, four, secondary, structural, units, southern, depression, northern, depression, central, uplift, and, eastern, slope, the, southern, depression, of, the, basin, is, characterized, by, an, asymmetric, fault, depression, composite, rift, with, steep, slopes, in, the, east, and, gentle, slopes, in, the, west, on, the, profile, and, is, distributed, in, an, nnw, direction, on, the, plane, there, are, two, large, basin, bounding, normal, fault, developed, on, both, sides, of, the, basin, with, a, graben, style, fault, and, depression, in, the, middle, the, east, and, west, sides, are, outward, dipping, low, angle, gentle, slope, areas, the, eastern, boundary, fault, is, steep, with, a, dip, angle, of, about, 55, while, the, western, fault, has, a, dip, angle, of, about, 45, the, overall, thickness, of, the, inner, layer, in, the, slope, area, is, relatively, thin, in, the, central, area, of, the, basin, the, thickness, of, the, sedimentary, strata, is, large, and, the, thickness, of, the, sedimentary, center, zone, reaches, over, 10, 000, m, 33, 000, ft, the, northern, part, of, the, basin, appears, steep, in, the, west, and, gentle, in, the, east, on, the, profile, five, fault, structural, zones, parallel, to, the, basin, bounding, faults, have, developed, from, west, to, east, lake, chad, is, divided, into, north, and, south, parts, by, a, shallow, sill, called, the, great, barrier, with, the, bottom, of, the, northern, basin, at, an, altitude, of, 275, 3, m, 903, ft, and, the, bottom, of, the, southern, basin, at, 278, 2, m, 913, ft, when, the, water, level, in, the, south, exceeds, 279, m, 915, ft, above, sea, level, it, will, flow, into, the, north, in, the, south, there, is, continuous, open, water, at, the, mouth, of, the, chari, river, and, the, western, part, of, the, water, is, covered, by, reed, swamps, and, the, sand, dunes, that, are, not, completely, submerged, in, the, eastern, waters, form, an, archipelago, the, average, depth, of, the, southern, lake, basin, is, between, 5, and, 2, m, 1, ft, 8, in, and, 6, ft, 7, in, that, of, the, northern, lake, basin, is, between, 0, and, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, and, that, of, the, eastern, archipelago, is, between, 0, and, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, the, climate, of, the, lake, chad, region, is, strongly, influenced, by, continental, and, maritime, air, masses, the, maritime, air, mass, moves, northward, during, the, summer, producing, seasonal, precipitation, in, late, summer, continental, air, mass, dominate, again, the, average, annual, precipitation, in, the, lake, chad, area, is, 330, mm, 13, in, with, an, average, annual, precipitation, of, 560, mm, 22, 0, in, on, the, south, bank, and, about, 250, mm, 9, 8, in, on, the, north, bank, the, highest, temperature, in, the, rainy, season, is, 30, c, and, the, highest, temperature, rises, to, more, than, 32, c, 90, f, when, october, and, november, enter, the, dry, season, the, temperature, difference, between, day, and, night, is, almost, twice, that, of, the, rainy, season, and, the, lowest, nighttime, temperature, sometimes, drops, to, 8, c, 46, f, in, december, and, january, april, is, usually, the, hottest, month, of, the, year, with, temperatures, occasionally, reaching, 40, c, 104, f, the, lowest, water, levels, appear, in, june, to, july, and, the, highest, water, levels, in, november, to, december, with, surface, water, temperatures, ranging, from, 19, to, 32, c, 66, to, 90, f, the, chad, basin, covers, an, area, of, about, 1, 10, 6, km, 2, 390, 000, sq, mi, and, is, injected, by, the, chari, logone, and, yobe, rivers, the, water, supply, of, the, lake, is, seasonal, most, of, the, precipitation, comes, from, the, adamawa, plateau, in, the, south, of, the, basin, which, is, transported, to, the, lake, basin, through, the, chari, river, and, the, logone, river, the, two, contribute, 95, of, the, total, inflow, of, lake, chad, while, the, yobe, river, only, contributes, less, than, 2, 5, the, lake, seeps, through, the, underground, to, the, lowest, point, of, the, chad, basin, the, bod, l, depression, approximately, 480, km, 300, mi, northeast, of, lake, chad, with, the, deepest, point, reaching, an, elevation, of, only, 155, m, 509, ft, above, sea, level, this, takes, away, most, of, the, salinity, and, maintains, the, low, salinity, of, lake, chad, the, southwestern, waters, of, lake, chad, being, freshwater, and, the, water, in, the, northeast, is, only, slightly, salty, the, water, volume, of, most, large, lakes, in, africa, depends, on, rainfall, and, evaporation, which, means, that, temperature, and, precipitation, are, crucial, for, regulating, the, water, balance, of, these, bodies, of, water, and, any, fluctuations, can, cause, significant, changes, in, their, water, level, and, area, lake, chad, is, a, shallow, inland, lake, and, the, rainfall, in, the, chad, basin, is, very, sensitive, to, small, changes, in, atmospheric, circulation, so, the, surface, area, of, lake, chad, is, greatly, affected, by, climate, change, dry, climate, due, to, vegetation, loss, from, overgrazing, and, deforestation, and, large, scale, irrigation, projects, that, diverted, water, from, the, rivers, that, feed, the, lake, are, the, main, reasons, for, the, shrinkage, of, lake, chad, the, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, and, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, have, affected, precipitation, in, the, sahel, region, from, the, early, 1960s, to, the, mid, 1980s, the, lake, water, level, decreased, by, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, compared, to, the, average, level, from, 1900, to, 2010, in, 1870, the, area, of, lake, chad, was, about, 28, 000, km, 2, 11, 000, sq, mi, the, lake, was, able, to, flow, out, of, the, bahr, el, ghazal, during, the, rainy, season, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, area, of, lake, chad, shrank, briefly, and, reached, a, new, high, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, and, overflowed, from, the, bahr, el, ghazal, again, a, major, drought, started, in, the, sahel, region, in, the, late, 1960s, and, caused, severe, damage, in, 1972, and, 1984, it, was, thought, to, be, related, to, vegetation, loss, global, warming, and, sea, surface, temperature, anomalies, during, this, period, lake, chad, shrunk, considerably, and, fluctuated, in, the, range, of, 2, 000, to, 5, 000, km, 2, 770, to, 1, 930, sq, mi, thereafter, from, june, 1966, to, january, 1973, the, area, of, lake, chad, shrank, from, 22, 772, to, 15, 400, km, 2, 8, 792, to, 5, 946, sq, mi, further, shrunk, to, 4, 398, km, 2, 1, 698, sq, mi, in, 1975, and, only, 1, 756, km, 2, 678, sq, mi, in, february, 1994, since, then, the, area, of, lake, chad, has, entered, a, relatively, stable, stage, with, a, slight, increase, from, 1995, to, 1998, it, fluctuated, within, the, range, of, 1, 200, to, 4, 500, km, 2, 460, to, 1, 740, sq, mi, the, area, once, reached, 5, 075, square, kilometres, 1, 959, sq, mi, in, 2000, and, the, average, area, of, surface, water, from, 2013, to, 2016, was, about, 1, 876, km, 2, 724, sq, mi, with, the, largest, area, being, 2, 231, km, 2, 861, sq, mi, in, july, 2015, part, of, the, chad, basin, is, located, within, the, chad, basin, national, park, in, nigeria, and, the, country, and, cameroon, have, established, the, lake, chad, ramsar, wetland, with, a, total, area, of, 8, 225, km, 2, 3, 176, sq, mi, the, wetland, plants, in, the, south, mainly, include, cyperus, papyrus, etc, reeds, mainly, grow, in, the, north, where, the, salinity, is, high, and, the, floating, plant, pistia, sometimes, covers, large, areas, of, open, water, plants, such, as, hyparrhenia, rufa, grow, on, the, shores, of, lakes, with, long, floods, in, the, south, the, area, of, permanent, vegetation, has, increased, from, about, 3, 800, km, 2, 1, 500, sq, mi, in, 2000, to, about, 5, 200, km, 2, 2, 000, sq, mi, in, 2020, as, water, levels, have, dropped, and, temperatures, have, increased, the, surrounding, dense, woodland, has, been, converted, to, open, forest, with, acacias, baobabs, palms, and, indian, jujube, lake, chad, is, permanently, or, seasonally, inhabited, by, hundreds, of, species, of, birds, such, as, northern, shoveler, egyptian, goose, and, marabou, stork, it, is, an, important, wintering, ground, for, european, anatididae, and, wading, birds, there, are, raptors, such, as, steppe, eagle, and, booted, eagle, on, the, lakeshore, and, more, than, one, million, ruff, can, be, observed, on, the, lake, at, one, time, the, once, common, large, mammals, include, red, fronted, gazelle, dama, gazelle, patas, monkey, striped, hyena, cheetah, and, caracal, while, african, elephant, otter, hippopotamus, sitatunga, and, kob, are, distributed, in, the, wetlands, at, present, most, of, the, large, mammals, have, been, hunted, to, extinction, replaced, by, a, large, number, of, cattle, the, entire, chad, basin, has, 179, species, of, fish, of, which, 127, are, the, same, as, the, niger, river, basin, 85, are, the, same, as, the, nile, river, basin, 47, are, the, same, as, the, congo, river, basin, and, 84, fish, species, are, distributed, in, the, lake, this, makes, it, a, rich, fishing, ground, for, communities, across, nigeria, niger, chad, and, cameroon, the, seasonal, influx, of, floods, combined, with, seasonal, increases, in, air, temperature, leads, to, decreased, salinity, increased, turbidity, and, increased, trophic, levels, which, catalyzed, a, surge, in, the, number, of, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, allowing, large, fish, to, migrate, seasonally, within, the, watershed, to, feed, and, breed, in, the, fertile, floodplain, when, floods, arrive, there, are, more, than, 30, million, residents, in, the, chad, lake, basin, there, are, more, than, 70, ethnic, groups, around, the, lake, most, of, whom, are, distributed, on, the, south, bank, where, the, population, density, exceeds, 100, km, 2, 260, sq, mi, they, rely, on, the, water, source, of, chad, lake, for, irrigation, breeding, animal, husbandry, and, drinking, local, self, sufficient, crops, include, sorghum, maize, finger, millet, beans, and, vegetables, gourd, is, widely, planted, for, making, utensils, the, collection, of, forest, products, such, as, gum, arabic, honey, beeswax, and, firewood, is, of, great, significance, in, the, region, however, the, reduction, in, forest, area, has, had, a, negative, impact, on, the, production, of, these, products, and, the, explosive, growth, of, cattle, herds, has, exacerbated, this, impact, cattle, are, the, most, important, livestock, raised, as, well, as, poultry, goats, sheep, camels, horses, and, donkeys, the, animal, husbandry, was, severely, affected, by, the, droughts, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, fishing, has, traditionally, been, the, most, important, economic, activity, for, the, people, of, the, lake, area, which, almost, ceased, during, drought, periods, and, only, resumed, in, the, mid, 1990s, most, fishing, products, are, dried, pickled, or, smoked, the, natron, produced, in, the, depression, on, the, northeast, bank, of, the, lake, has, long, been, of, significant, economic, significance, traditionally, it, has, been, excavated, in, blocks, and, transported, across, the, lake, to, enter, the, nigerian, market, since, the, drought, in, the, 1970s, the, soil, that, can, be, planted, without, irrigation, and, fertilization, has, been, exposed, at, the, bottom, of, the, lake, and, it, has, been, reclaimed, as, a, polder, for, planting, maize, cowpea, rice, sorghum, and, other, crops, farmers, have, shifted, from, planting, mainly, dry, crops, such, as, wheat, to, rice, with, high, water, demand, resulting, in, more, serious, soil, salinization, and, water, eutrophication, the, adverse, effects, of, reduced, water, sources, on, fishing, farming, and, herding, outweigh, the, benefits, of, new, land, from, the, receding, waters, the, surrounding, residents, who, used, to, rely, on, lake, water, were, forced, to, relocate, causing, the, economy, of, the, lake, area, to, continuously, shrink, since, 1970, five, countries, in, the, southern, part, of, the, basin, have, constructed, numerous, water, conservancy, projects, in, the, upper, reaches, of, the, chari, river, logone, river, and, yobe, river, to, intercept, river, water, resulting, in, a, sharp, decrease, in, the, amount, of, water, entering, the, lake, the, average, annual, inflow, of, the, chari, river, and, the, logone, river, from, 1970, to, 1990, was, only, 55, of, that, from, 1950, to, 1970, since, the, 1980s, one, third, of, the, water, in, the, chari, river, and, the, logone, river, has, been, diverted, and, intercepted, by, the, central, african, republic, located, upstream, for, agricultural, irrigation, and, hydroelectric, power, generation, the, dams, built, on, the, upper, reaches, of, the, rivers, entering, the, lake, changed, the, time, and, scope, of, seasonal, floods, and, disrupted, the, migration, of, fish, resulting, in, a, sharp, reduction, in, the, populations, of, alestes, baremoze, and, nile, perch, the, main, catches, of, lake, chad, and, a, significant, reduction, in, the, catch, at, the, same, time, the, conflicts, between, countries, and, ethnic, groups, competing, for, water, and, land, are, also, escalating, the, four, countries, along, the, lake, are, all, facing, the, problem, of, extreme, poverty, and, due, to, the, difficulty, in, meeting, their, livelihoods, some, local, residents, have, been, involved, in, drug, and, arms, trade, this, has, been, exacerbated, by, the, activity, of, boko, haram, an, insurgency, that, has, displaced, millions, of, people, and, disrupted, development, through, the, region, cameroon, niger, nigeria, and, chad, established, the, lake, chad, basin, commission, on, 22, may, 1964, the, central, african, republic, joined, in, 1996, and, libya, joined, in, 2008, the, headquarters, of, the, committee, is, located, in, n, djamena, chad, the, commission, s, tasks, include, managing, lake, chad, and, its, water, resources, protecting, the, ecosystem, and, promoting, regional, integration, peace, security, and, development, in, the, lake, chad, region, the, surrounding, countries, water, replenishment, plan, for, lake, chad, includes, the, construction, of, a, 2, 400, km, 1, 500, mi, canal, to, transport, 100, 10, 9, m, 3, 130, 10, 9, cu, yd, of, water, from, the, congo, river, basin, to, the, chari, river, basin, every, year, and, use, a, series, of, dams, along, the, route, to, generate, electricity
