provisional, cretan, government, it, joined, the, kingdom, of, greece, it, was, occupied, by, nazi, germany, during, the, second, world, war, stone, tools, suggest, that, archaic, humans, may, have, visited, crete, as, early, as, 130, 000, years, ago, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, permanent, settlement, of, the, island, until, the, neolithic, around, 7, 000, bce, settlements, dating, to, the, aceramic, neolithic, in, the, 7th, millennium, bc, used, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and, dogs, as, well, as, domesticated, cereals, and, legumes, ancient, knossos, was, the, site, of, one, of, these,

civilization, notable, for, its, art, its, writing, systems, such, as, linear, a, and, for, its, massive, building, complexes, including, the, palace, at, knossos, its, economy, benefited, from, a, network, of, trade, around, much, of, the, mediterranean, and, minoan, cultural, influence, extended, to, cyprus, canaan, and, egypt, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, legends, such, as, that, of, the, minotaur, have, a, historical, basis, in, minoan, times, in, 1420, bc, the, minoan, civilization, was, subsumed, by, the, mycenaean, civilization, from, mainland, greece, the, oldest, samples, of, writing, in, the, greek, language, as, identified, by, michael, ventris, is, the, linear, b, archive, from, knossos, dated, approximately, to, 1425, 1375, bc, after, the, bronze, age, collapse, crete, was, settled, by, new, waves, of, greeks, from, the, mainland, a, number, of, city, states, developed, in, the, archaic, period, there, was, limited, contact, with, mainland, greece, and, greek, historiography, shows, little, interest, in, crete, as, a, result, there, are, few, literary, sources, during, the, 6th, to, 4th, centuries, bc, crete, was, comparatively, free, from, warfare, the, gortyn, code, 5th, century, bc, is, evidence, for, how, codified, civil, law, established, a, balance, between, aristocratic, power, and, civil, rights, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, the, aristocratic, order, began, to, collapse, due, to, endemic, infighting, among, the, elite, and, crete, s, economy, was, weakened, by, prolonged, wars, between, city, states, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, gortyn, kydonia, chania, lyttos, and, polyrrhenia, challenged, the, primacy, of, ancient, knossos, while, the, cities, continued, to, prey, upon, one, another, they, invited, into, their, feuds, mainland, powers, like, macedon, and, its, rivals, rhodes, and, ptolemaic, egypt, in, 220, bc, the, island, was, tormented, by, a, war, between, two, opposing, coalitions, of, cities, as, a, result, the, macedonian, king, philip, v, gained, hegemony, over, crete, which, lasted, to, the, end, of, the, cretan, war, 205, 200, bc, when, the, rhodians, opposed, the, rise, of, macedon, and, the, romans, started, to, interfere, in, cretan, affairs, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, ierapytna, ierapetra, gained, supremacy, on, eastern, crete, crete, was, involved, in, the, mithridatic, wars, initially, repelling, an, attack, by, roman, general, marcus, antonius, creticus, in, 71, bc, nevertheless, a, ferocious, three, year, campaign, soon, followed, under, quintus, caecilius, metellus, equipped, with, three, legions, crete, was, conquered, by, rome, in, 69, bc, earning, for, metellus, the, title, creticus, gortyn, was, made, capital, of, the, island, and, crete, became, a, roman, province, along, with, cyrenaica, that, was, called, creta, et, cyrenaica, archaeological, remains, suggest, that, crete, under, roman, rule, witnessed, prosperity, and, increased, connectivity, with, other, parts, of, the, empire, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, at, least, three, cities, in, crete, lyttos, gortyn, hierapytna, joined, the, panhellenion, a, league, of, greek, cities, founded, by, the, emperor, hadrian, when, diocletian, redivided, the, empire, crete, was, placed, along, with, cyrene, under, the, diocese, of, moesia, and, later, by, constantine, i, to, the, diocese, of, macedonia, crete, was, separated, from, cyrenaica, c, 297, it, remained, a, province, within, the, eastern, half, of, the, roman, empire, usually, referred, to, as, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, after, the, establishment, of, a, second, capital, in, constantinople, by, constantine, in, 330, crete, was, subjected, to, an, attack, by, vandals, in, 467, the, great, earthquakes, of, 365, and, 415, a,

of, the, pope, to, that, of, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, in, the, 820s, after, 900, years, as, a, roman, island, crete, was, captured, by, andalusian, muwallads, led, by, abu, hafs, who,
