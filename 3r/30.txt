the, arctic, circle, is, one, of, the, two, polar, circles, and, the, most, northerly, of, the, five, major, circles, of, latitude, as, shown, on, maps, of, earth, at, about, 66, 34, n, its, southern, equivalent, is, the, antarctic, circle, the, arctic, circle, marks, the, southernmost, latitude, at, which, on, the, winter, solstice, which, is, the, shortest, day, of, the, year, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, sun, will, not, rise, all, day, and, on, the, northern, hemisphere, s, summer, solstice, which, is, the, longest, day, of, the, year, the, sun, will, not, set, these, phenomena, are, referred, to, as, polar, night, and, midnight, sun, respectively, and, the, further, north, one, progresses, the, more, pronounced, these, effects, become, for, example, in, the, russian, port, city, of, murmansk, three, degrees, above, the, arctic, circle, the, sun, does, not, rise, above, the, horizon, for, 40, successive, days, in, midwinter, the, position, of, the, arctic, circle, is, not, fixed, and, currently, runs, 66, 33, 50, 1, north, of, the, equator, its, latitude, depends, on, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, which, fluctuates, within, a, margin, of, more, than, 2, over, a, 41, 000, year, period, owing, to, tidal, forces, resulting, from, the, orbit, of, the, moon, consequently, the, arctic, circle, is, currently, drifting, northwards, at, a, speed, of, about, 14, 5, m, 48, ft, per, year, the, word, arctic, comes, from, the, greek, word, arktikos, near, the, bear, northern, and, that, from, the, word, arktos, bear, the, arctic, circle, is, the, southernmost, latitude, in, the, northern, hemisphere, at, which, the, centre, of, the, sun, can, remain, continuously, above, or, below, the, horizon, for, twenty, four, hours, as, a, result, at, least, once, each, year, at, any, location, within, the, arctic, circle, the, centre, of, the, sun, is, visible, at, local, midnight, and, at, least, once, the, centre, is, not, visible, at, local, noon, directly, on, the, arctic, circle, these, events, occur, in, principle, exactly, once, per, year, at, the, june, and, december, solstices, respectively, however, because, of, atmospheric, refraction, and, mirages, and, also, because, the, sun, appears, as, a, disk, and, not, a, point, part, of, the, midnight, sun, is, visible, on, the, night, of, the, northern, summer, solstice, at, a, latitude, of, about, 50, minutes, of, arc, 90, km, 56, mi, south, of, the, arctic, circle, similarly, on, the, day, of, the, northern, winter, solstice, part, of, the, sun, may, be, seen, up, to, about, 50, north, of, the, arctic, circle, that, is, true, at, sea, level, those, limits, increase, with, elevation, above, sea, level, although, in, mountainous, regions, there, is, often, no, direct, view, of, the, true, horizon, the, largest, communities, north, of, the, arctic, circle, are, situated, in, russia, norway, and, sweden, murmansk, population, 295, 374, and, norilsk, 178, 018, in, russia, troms, 75, 638, in, norway, vorkuta, 58, 133, in, russia, bod, 52, 357, and, harstad, 24, 703, in, norway, and, kiruna, sweden, 22, 841, rovaniemi, 62, 667, in, finland, is, the, largest, settlement, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, arctic, circle, lying, 6, km, 4, mi, south, of, the, line, salekhard, 51, 186, in, russia, is, the, only, city, in, the, world, located, directly, on, the, arctic, circle, in, contrast, the, largest, north, american, community, north, of, the, arctic, circle, sisimiut, greenland, has, approximately, 5, 600, inhabitants, in, the, united, states, utqiagvik, alaska, formerly, known, as, barrow, is, the, largest, settlement, north, of, the, arctic, circle, with, about, 5, 000, inhabitants, the, largest, such, community, in, canada, is, inuvik, in, the, northwest, territories, with, 3, 137, inhabitants, download, coordinates, as, the, arctic, circle, is, roughly, 16, 000, km, 9, 900, mi, in, circumference, the, area, north, of, the, circle, is, about, 20, 000, 000, km, 2, 7, 700, 000, sq, mi, and, covers, roughly, 4, of, earth, s, surface, the, arctic, circle, passes, through, the, arctic, ocean, the, scandinavian, peninsula, north, asia, northern, america, and, greenland, the, land, within, the, arctic, circle, is, divided, among, eight, countries, norway, sweden, finland, russia, the, united, states, alaska, canada, yukon, northwest, territories, and, nunavut, denmark, greenland, and, iceland, where, it, passes, through, the, small, offshore, island, of, gr, msey, the, climate, north, of, the, arctic, circle, is, generally, cold, but, the, coastal, areas, of, norway, have, a, generally, mild, climate, as, a, result, of, the, gulf, stream, which, makes, the, ports, of, northern, norway, and, northwest, russia, ice, free, all, year, long, in, the, interior, summers, can, be, quite, warm, while, winters, are, extremely, cold, for, example, summer, temperatures, in, norilsk, russia, will, sometimes, reach, as, high, as, 30, c, 86, f, while, the, winter, temperatures, frequently, fall, below, 50, c, 58, f, starting, at, the, prime, meridian, and, heading, eastwards, the, arctic, circle, passes, through
