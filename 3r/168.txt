river, in, english, is, the, estuary, formed, by, the, confluence, of, the, uruguay, river, and, the, paran, river, at, punta, gorda, it, empties, into, the, atlantic, ocean, and, forms, a, funnel, shaped, indentation, on, the, southeastern, coastline, of, south, america, depending, on, the, geographer, the, r, o, de, la, plata, may, be, considered, a, river, an, estuary, a, gulf, or, a, marginal, sea, if, considered, a, river, it, is, the, widest, in, the, world, with, a, maximum, width, of, 220, kilometres, 140, mi, the, river, is, about, 290, kilometres, 180, mi, long, and, widens, from, about, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, at, its, source, to, about, 220, kilometres, 140, mi, at, its, mouth, it, forms, part, of, the, border, between, argentina, and, uruguay, the, name, r, o, de, la, plata, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, populations, along, the, estuary, especially, the, main, port, cities, of, buenos, aires, and, montevideo, where, rioplatense, spanish, is, spoken, and, tango, culture, developed, the, coasts, of, the, river, are, the, most, densely, populated, areas, of, uruguay, and, argentina, the, r, o, de, la, plata, begins, at, the, confluence, of, the, uruguay, and, paran, rivers, at, punta, gorda, and, flows, eastward, into, the, south, atlantic, ocean, no, clear, physical, boundary, marks, the, river, s, eastern, end, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, as, a, line, joining, punta, del, este, uruguay, and, cabo, san, antonio, argentina, though, it, is, generally, spoken, of, as, a, river, the, r, o, de, la, plata, is, considered, by, some, geographers, to, be, a, large, bay, or, marginal, sea, of, the, atlantic, ocean, for, those, who, regard, it, as, a, river, it, is, the, widest, in, the, world, with, a, maximum, width, of, about, 220, kilometres, 140, mi, and, a, total, surface, area, of, about, 35, 000, square, kilometres, 14, 000, sq, mi, the, upper, river, contains, several, islands, including, oyarvide, island, and, the, sol, s, islands, in, argentine, waters, and, juncal, island, islote, el, mat, n, mart, n, garc, a, island, and, timoteo, dom, nguez, island, in, uruguayan, waters, because, of, deposition, of, sediments, from, the, heavy, stream, load, carried, down, from, the, river, s, tributaries, the, islands, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, generally, grow, over, time, a, submerged, shoal, the, barra, del, indio, divides, the, r, o, de, la, plata, into, an, inner, freshwater, riverine, portion, and, an, outer, brackish, estuarine, portion, the, shoal, is, located, approximately, between, montevideo, and, punta, piedras, the, northwest, end, of, samboromb, n, bay, the, inner, fluvial, zone, is, about, 180, kilometres, 110, mi, long, and, up, to, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, wide, with, a, depth, which, varies, from, about, 1, to, 5, metres, 3, 3, to, 16, 4, ft, the, depth, of, the, outer, estuary, zone, increases, from, 5, to, 25, metres, 16, to, 82, ft, the, river, s, discharge, is, strong, enough, to, prevent, saltwater, from, penetrating, to, the, inner, portion, the, r, o, de, la, plata, behaves, as, an, estuary, in, which, freshwater, and, seawater, mix, the, freshwater, comes, principally, from, the, paran, river, one, of, the, world, s, longest, rivers, and, la, plata, s, main, tributary, as, well, as, from, the, uruguay, river, and, other, smaller, streams, currents, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, are, dominated, by, tides, reaching, to, its, sources, and, beyond, into, the, uruguay, and, paran, rivers, both, rivers, are, tidally, influenced, for, about, 190, kilometres, 120, mi, the, tidal, ranges, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, are, small, but, its, great, width, allows, for, a, tidal, prism, important, enough, to, dominate, the, flow, regime, despite, the, huge, discharge, received, from, the, tributary, rivers, the, river, is, a, salt, wedge, estuary, in, which, saltwater, being, denser, than, freshwater, penetrates, into, the, estuary, in, a, layer, below, the, freshwater, which, floats, on, the, surface, salinity, fronts, or, haloclines, form, at, the, bottom, and, on, the, surface, where, fresh, and, brackish, waters, meet, the, salinity, fronts, are, also, pycnoclines, due, to, the, water, density, discontinuities, they, play, an, important, role, in, the, reproductive, processes, of, fish, species, the, r, o, de, la, plata, s, drainage, basin, sometimes, called, the, platine, basin, or, platine, region, is, the, 3, 170, 000, km, 2, 1, 220, 000, sq, mi, 3, 182, 064, km, 2, 1, 228, 602, sq, mi, hydrographical, area, that, drains, to, the, r, o, de, la, plata, it, includes, areas, of, southeastern, bolivia, southern, and, central, brazil, the, entire, country, of, paraguay, most, of, uruguay, and, northern, argentina, making, up, about, one, fourth, of, the, continent, s, surface, it, is, the, second, largest, drainage, basin, in, south, america, after, the, amazon, basin, and, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, the, main, rivers, of, the, la, plata, basin, are, the, paran, river, the, paraguay, river, the, paran, s, main, tributary, and, the, uruguay, river, the, paran, river, s, main, tributaries, include, the, parana, ba, river, grande, river, tiet, river, paranapanema, river, iguazu, river, paraguay, river, and, the, salado, river, after, which, it, ends, in, the, large, paran, delta, the, paraguay, river, flows, through, the, pantanal, wetland, after, which, its, main, tributaries, include, the, pilcomayo, river, and, the, bermejo, river, before, it, ends, in, the, paran, the, uruguay, s, main, tributaries, include, the, pelotas, river, canoas, river, ibicu, river, and, the, r, o, negro, another, significant, tributary, to, the, r, o, de, la, plata, is, the, salado, del, sur, river, nomadic, aboriginal, people, inhabited, the, r, o, de, la, plata, region, for, thousands, of, years, before, european, settlers, arrived, and, their, descendants, continue, to, live, in, the, region, to, this, day, the, r, o, de, la, plata, was, first, explored, by, the, portuguese, in, 1512, 13, the, spanish, first, explored, it, in, 1516, when, the, navigator, juan, d, az, de, sol, s, traversed, it, during, his, search, for, a, passage, between, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, oceans, calling, it, the, mar, dulce, or, freshwater, sea, the, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, magellan, briefly, explored, the, estuary, in, 1520, before, his, expedition, continued, its, circumnavigation, and, in, 1521, crist, v, o, jacques, also, explored, the, plate, river, estuary, and, ascended, the, parana, river, for, the, first, time, entering, it, for, about, 23, leagues, around, 140, km, to, near, the, present, city, of, rosario, explorer, sebastian, cabot, made, a, detailed, study, of, the, river, and, its, tributaries, and, gave, it, its, modern, name, he, explored, the, paran, and, uruguay, rivers, between, 1526, and, 1529, ascending, the, paran, as, far, as, the, present, day, city, of, asunci, n, and, also, explored, up, the, paraguay, river, cabot, acquired, silver, trinkets, trading, with, the, guaran, near, today, s, asunci, n, and, these, objects, together, with, legends, of, a, sierra, de, la, plata, in, the, south, american, interior, brought, back, by, earlier, explorers, inspired, him, to, rename, the, river, r, o, de, la, plata, river, of, silver, the, first, european, colony, was, the, city, of, buenos, aires, founded, by, pedro, de, mendoza, on, 2, february, 1536, this, settlement, however, was, quickly, abandoned, the, failure, to, establish, a, settlement, on, the, estuary, led, to, explorations, upriver, and, the, founding, of, asunci, n, in, 1537, the, area, was, visited, by, francis, drake, s, fleet, in, early, 1578, in, the, early, stages, of, his, circumnavigation, buenos, aires, was, re, founded, by, juan, de, garay, on, 11, june, 1580, during, the, colonial, era, the, r, o, de, la, plata, was, made, the, center, of, the, governorate, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, the, r, o, de, la, plata, region, particularly, buenos, aires, was, a, significant, site, of, trade, throughout, the, 17th, century, the, crown, initially, intended, buenos, aires, to, be, a, military, establishment, for, the, protection, of, the, potos, mines, but, it, soon, became, evident, that, a, settlement, large, enough, to, provide, military, defense, would, attract, trade, the, primary, export, was, silver, from, the, mines, of, potos, and, imports, generally, included, european, luxury, goods, slaves, and, sugar, this, trade, occurred, outside, of, the, fleet, system, authorized, by, the, spanish, crown, and, therefore, was, generally, considered, illicit, however, under, the, monarchy, of, the, spanish, habsburgs, the, line, between, licit, and, illicit, trade, was, quite, blurry, crown, officials, and, military, outposts, in, buenos, aires, often, relied, upon, profits, from, illicit, trade, to, support, their, administrative, structures, under, the, bourbon, monarchy, the, governorate, was, elevated, to, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1776, this, occurred, as, a, result, of, the, bourbon, reforms, which, attempted, to, restore, the, decaying, wealth, of, the, spanish, crown, the, reforms, elevated, the, status, of, trade, along, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, expanded, what, constituted, legal, trade, so, that, the, crown, could, tax, trade, which, had, previously, been, contraband, however, the, plan, did, not, go, as, intended, although, trade, along, the, r, o, de, la, plata, flourished, very, little, silver, was, actually, remitted, to, the, crown, then, spanish, war, with, britain, and, the, simultaneous, eruption, of, revolts, in, the, mining, regions, of, peru, led, to, a, shortage, of, silver, putting, strain, on, the, merchant, class, of, buenos, aires, this, caused, a, schism, between, merchants, who, wanted, to, try, to, continue, reviving, the, spanish, empire, through, silver, trade, and, those, who, wanted, to, move, on, from, silver, and, prioritize, agricultural, exports, ultimately, tearing, at, the, fabric, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, region, s, relationship, with, the, spanish, empire, in, 1806, and, 1807, the, river, was, the, scene, of, an, important, british, invasion, that, aimed, to, occupy, the, area, and, was, defeated, by, the, local, garrison, and, population, conflict, in, the, region, intensified, after, the, independence, of, the, former, spanish, and, portuguese, colonies, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, interests, in, the, territories, and, the, navigation, rights, over, the, platine, region, played, a, major, role, in, many, armed, conflicts, throughout, the, century, including, the, argentine, civil, wars, the, cisplatine, and, platine, wars, and, the, paraguayan, war, the, river, was, blockaded, by, brazil, from, 1826, to, 1828, by, the, french, from, 1838, to, 1840, and, by, an, anglo, french, alliance, from, 1845, to, 1850, during, the, cisplatine, war, the, r, o, de, la, plata, was, blockaded, by, the, imperial, brazilian, navy, aiming, to, cripple, argentine, finances, and, resupply, their, positions, in, colonia, del, sacramento, and, montevideo, squadrons, of, the, newly, independent, united, provinces, of, the, river, plate, led, by, the, irish, argentine, admiral, william, brown, attempted, to, break, the, blockade, despite, numerical, inferiority, in, the, first, major, naval, engagement, of, the, war, an, argentine, squadron, left, port, in, the, early, hours, of, february, 9, to, challenge, the, blockade, the, battle, was, inconclusive, with, the, argentine, fleet, breaking, contact, and, the, brazilian, admiral, failing, to, give, chase, in, july, 29, a, brazilian, fleet, led, by, the, english, admiral, james, norton, engaged, brown, s, fleet, near, ensenada, norton, split, his, force, catching, the, argentine, line, between, two, fires, and, causing, significant, casualties, william, brown, s, flagship, the, frigate, 25, de, mayo, sank, after, the, battle, as, a, result, of, the, damage, received, in, 8, 9, february, an, argentine, fleet, led, by, brown, engaged, the, third, division, of, the, imperial, navy, on, the, uruguay, river, inflicting, heavy, casualties, against, a, disorganized, brazilian, squadron, the, argentines, routed, the, third, division, capturing, or, destroying, fifteen, brazilian, vessels, whilst, losing, none, and, frustrating, the, brazilian, attempt, to, control, the, uruguay, river, near, the, coast, of, ensenada, in, april, 7, four, argentine, vessels, led, by, brown, slipped, out, of, port, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, surprise, a, large, brazilian, fleet, under, the, command, of, norton, two, brigs, were, sunk, and, a, schooner, was, heavily, damaged, resulting, in, a, decisive, brazilian, victory, that, ensured, the, imperial, blockade, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, until, the, preliminary, peace, convention, of, 1828, the, blockade, caused, serious, problems, to, the, export, oriented, economy, of, buenos, aires, but, indirectly, contributed, to, rural, provinces, such, as, c, rdoba, allowing, producers, to, sell, native, products, to, buenos, aires, at, an, increased, price, in, the, first, naval, battle, of, the, second, world, war, the, german, pocket, battleship, admiral, graf, spee, was, engaged, by, the, royal, navy, rn, cruisers, hms, exeter, and, ajax, and, the, royal, new, zealand, navy, cruiser, achilles, off, the, estuary, of, the, river, plate, in, december, 1939, the, german, ship, retired, up, the, estuary, with, a, crippled, fuel, system, and, put, into, port, at, montevideo, a, few, days, later, rather, than, fight, when, believing, himself, outgunned, her, captain, scuttled, her, in, the, estuary, this, engagement, was, part, of, the, early, battle, of, the, atlantic, the, historical, english, name, river, plate, uses, an, obsolete, sense, of, the, word, plate, which, was, used, extensively, as, a, term, for, silver, or, gold, from, the, 12th, century, onwards, especially, in, early, modern, english, the, estuary, has, been, known, as, the, river, plate, or, plate, river, in, english, since, at, least, the, time, of, francis, drake, this, english, version, of, the, name, served, as, an, inspiration, for, one, of, argentina, s, most, important, football, clubs, club, atl, tico, river, plate, a, more, literal, translation, of, the, name, is, silver, river, though, this, is, virtually, never, used, in, practice, the, r, o, de, la, plata, is, a, habitat, for, the, loggerhead, sea, turtle, green, sea, turtle, leatherback, sea, turtle, the,
