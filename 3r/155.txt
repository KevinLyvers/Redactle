southwesterly, direction, from, western, pennsylvania, to, its, mouth, on, the, mississippi, river, at, the, southern, tip, of, illinois, it, is, the, third, largest, river, by, discharge, volume, in, the, united, states, and, the, largest, tributary, by, volume, of, the, north, south, flowing, mississippi, river, which, divides, the, eastern, from, western, united, states, it, is, also, the, 6th,

largest, tributary, the, tennessee, river, the, basin, includes, several, states, of, the, southeastern, u, s, it, is, the, source, of, drinking, water, for, five, million, people, the, river, became, a, primary, transportation, route, for, pioneers, during, the, westward, expansion, of, the, early, u, s, the, lower, ohio, river, just, below, louisville, was, obstructed, by, rapids, known, as, the, falls, of, the, ohio, where, the, elevation, falls, 26, feet, 7, 9, m, in, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, restricting, larger, commercial, navigation, although, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, its, three, deepest, channels, could, be, traversed, by, a, wide, variety, of, craft, then, in, use, in, 1830, the, louisville, and, portland, canal, now, the, mcalpine, locks, and, dam, bypassed, the, rapids, allowing, even, larger, commercial, and, modern, navigation, from, the, forks, of, the, ohio, at, pittsburgh, to, the, port, of, new, orleans, at, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, on, the, gulf, of, mexico, since, the, canalization, of, the, river, in, 1929, the, ohio, has, not, been, a, natural, free, flowing, river, today, it, is, divided, into, 21, discrete, pools, or, reservoirs, by, 20, locks, and, dams, for, navigation, and, power, generation, the, name, ohio, comes, from, the, seneca, ohi, yo, lit, good, river, in, his, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, published, in, 1781, 82, thomas, jefferson, stated, the, ohio, is, the, most, beautiful, river, on, earth, its, current, gentle, waters, clear, and, bosom, smooth, and, unbroken, by, rocks, and, rapids, a, single, instance, only, excepted, after, the, french, and, indian, war, britain, s, trans, appalachian, indian, reserve, was, divided, by, the, river, into, colonial, lands, to, the, south, and, native, american, lands, to, the, north, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, river, became, the, southern, boundary, of, the, northwest, territory, the, river, is, sometimes, considered, as, the, western, extension, of, the, mason, dixon, line, that, divided, pennsylvania, from, maryland, and, thus, part, of, the, border, between, free, and, slave, territory, and, between, the, northern, and, southern, united, states, or, upper, south, where, the, river, was, narrow, it, was, crossed, by, thousands, of, slaves, escaping, to, the, north, for, freedom, many, were, helped, by, free, blacks, and, whites, of, the, underground, railroad, resistance, movement, the, ohio, river, is, a, climatic, transition, area, as, its, water, runs, along, the, periphery, of, the, humid, subtropical, and, humid, continental, climate, areas, it, is, inhabited, by, fauna, and, flora, of, both, climates, today, the, ohio, river, is, one, of, the, most, polluted, rivers, in, the, united, states, in, winter, it, regularly, freezes, over, at, pittsburgh, but, rarely, farther, south, towards, cincinnati, and, louisville, further, down, the, river, in, places, like, paducah, and, owensboro, kentucky, closer, to, its, confluence, with, the, mississippi, the, ohio, is, ice, free, year, round, the, name, ohio, comes, from, the, seneca, language, an, iroquoian, language, ohi, yo, roughly, pronounced, oh, hee, yoh, with, the, vowel, in, hee, held, longer, a, proper, name, derived, from, ohi, yo, h, good, river, therefore, literally, translating, to, good, river, great, river, and, large, creek, have, also, been, given, as, translations, native, americans, including, the, lenape, and, iroquois, considered, the, ohio, and, allegheny, rivers, as, the, same, as, is, suggested, by, a, new, york, state, road, sign, on, interstate, 86, that, refers, to, the, allegheny, river, also, as, ohi, yo, similarly, the, geographic, names, information, system, lists, o, hee, yo, and, o, hi, o, as, variant, names, for, the, allegheny, an, earlier, miami, illinois, language, name, was, also, applied, to, the, ohio, river, mosopeleacipi, river, of, the, mosopelea, tribe, shortened, in, the, shawnee, language, to, pelewa, thiipi, spelewathiipi, or, peleewa, thiipiiki, the, name, evolved, through, variant, forms, such, as, polesipi, peleson, pele, sipi, and, pere, sipi, and, eventually, stabilized, to, the, variant, spellings, pelisipi, pelisippi, and, pellissippi, originally, applied, just, to, the, ohio, river, the, pelisipi, name, later, was, variously, applied, back, and, forth, between, the, ohio, river, and, the, clinch, river, in, virginia, and, tennessee, in, his, original, draft, of, the, land, ordinance, of, 1784, thomas, jefferson, proposed, a, new, state, called, pelisipia, to, the, south, of, the, ohio, river, which, would, have, included, parts, of, present, day, eastern, kentucky, virginia, and, west, virginia, the, river, had, great, significance, in, the, history, of, the, native, americans, as, numerous, prehistoric, and, historic, civilizations, formed, along, its, valley, for, thousands, of, years, native, americans, used, the, river, as, a, major, transportation, and, trading, route, in, the, five, centuries, before, european, colonization, the, mississippian, culture, built, numerous, regional, chiefdoms, and, major, earthwork, mounds, in, the, ohio, valley, like, the, angel, mounds, near, evansville, indiana, as, well, as, in, the, mississippi, valley, and, the, southeast, the, historic, osage, omaha, ponca, and, kaw, peoples, lived, in, the, ohio, valley, under, pressure, over, the, fur, trade, from, the, iroquois, nations, to, the, northeast, they, migrated, west, of, the, mississippi, river, in, the, 17th, century, to, the, territory, now, defined, as, missouri, arkansas, and, oklahoma, several, accounts, exist, of, the, discovery, and, traversal, of, the, ohio, river, by, europeans, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 17th, century,

the, shawnee, and, bring, them, into, the, english, sphere, of, influence, viele, understood, several, native, american, languages, which, made, him, valuable, as, an, interpreter, he, is, credited, with, being, the, first, european, to, travel, and, explore, western, pennsylvania, and, the, upper, ohio, valley, viele, made, contact, with, native, american, nations, as, far, west, as, the, wabash, river, in, present, day, indiana, he, and, his, company, left, albany, traveling, southbound, and, crossing, portions, of, present, day, new, jersey, and, eastern, pennsylvania, they, apparently, followed, the, west, branch, of, the, susquehanna, river, into, the, mountains, traversing, the, tioga, river, and, reaching, a, tributary, of, the, allegheny, river, before, floating, down, to, the, shawnee, towns, along, the, ohio, river, viele, and, his, expedition, spent, most, of, 1693, exploring, the, ohio, river, and, its, tributaries, in, northern, kentucky, with, their, shawnee, hosts, gerit, luykasse, two, of, viele, s, dutch, traders, and, two, shawnee, reappeared, in, albany, in, february, 1694, to, fetch, powder, for, arnout, and, his, company, their, party, had,

near, big, bone, lick, and, possibly, the, falls, of, the, ohio, present, day, louisville, chaussegros, de, lery, mapped, the, great, lakes, in, 1725, and, engineered, the, niagara, fortifications, in, 1726, i, am, indebted, for, the, topographical, details, of, the, course, of, this, river, to, m, de, lery, engineer, who, surveyed, it, with, the, compass, at, the, time, that, he, descended, it, with, a, detachment, of, french, troops, in, 1729, a, map, of, the, ohio, river, valley, drawn, by, bellin, from, observations, by, de, lery, is, in, pierre, fran, ois, xavier, de, charlevoix, s,

established, in, virginia, colony, to, settle, and, trade, in, the, ohio, river, region, exploration, of, the, territory, and, trade, with, the, indians, in, the, region, near, the, forks, brought, white, colonists, from, both, pennsylvania, and, virginia, across, the, mountains, and, both, colonies, claimed, the, territory, the, movement, across, the, allegheny, mountains, of, anglo, american, settlers, and, the, claims, of, the, area, near, modern, day, pittsburgh, led, to, conflict, with, the, french, who, had, forts, in, the, ohio, river, valley, this, conflict, was, called, the, french, and, indian, war, and, would, merge, into, the, global, anglo, french, struggle, the, seven, years, war, in, 1763, following, its, defeat, in, the, war, france, ceded, its, area, east, of, the, mississippi, river, to, britain, and, its, area, west, of, the, mississippi, river, to, spain, in, the, 1763, treaty, of, paris, the, 1768, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, with, several, tribes, opened, kentucky, to, colonial, settlement, and, established, the, ohio, river, as, a, southern, boundary, for, american, indian, territory, in, 1774, the, quebec, act, restored, the, land, east, of, the, mississippi, river, and, north, of, the, ohio, river, to, quebec, in, effect, making, the, ohio, the, southern, boundary, of, canada, this, appeased, french, canadians, in, quebec, but, angered, the, colonists, of, the, thirteen, colonies, lord, dunmore, s, war, south, of, the, ohio, river, also, contributed, to, cession, of, land, north, to, quebec, to, prevent, colonial, expansion, onto, native, american, territory, during, the, revolutionary, war, in, 1776, the, british, military, engineer, john, montr, sor, created, a, map, of, the, river, showing, the, strategic, location, of, fort, pitt, including, specific, navigational, information, about, the, ohio, river, s, rapids, and, tributaries, in, that, area, however, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, gave, the, entire, ohio, valley, to, the, united, states, and, numerous, white, settlers, entered, the, region, the, economic, connection, of, the, ohio, country, to, the, east, was, significantly, increased, in, 1818, when, the, national, road, being, built, westward, from, cumberland, maryland, reached, wheeling, virginia, now, west, virginia, providing, an, easier, overland, connection, from, the, potomac, river, to, the, ohio, river, the, wheeling, suspension, bridge, was, built, over, the, river, at, wheeling, from, 1847, to, 1849, making, the, trip, west, easier, for, a, brief, time, until, 1851, it, was, the, world, s, largest, suspension, bridge, the, bridge, survived, the, american, civil, war, after, having, been, improved, in, 1859, it, was, renovated, again, in, 1872, and, remains, in, use, as, the, oldest, vehicular, suspension, bridge, in, the, u, s, louisville, was, founded, in, 1778, as, a, military, encampment, on, corn, island, now, submerged, by, general, george, rogers, clark, at, the, only, major, natural, navigational, barrier, on, the, river, the, falls, of, the, ohio, the, falls, were, a, series, of, rapids, where, the, river, dropped, 26, feet, 7, 9, m, in, a, stretch, of, about, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, in, this, area, the, river, flowed, over, hard, fossil, rich, beds, of, limestone, the, outpost, was, moved, that, same, year, to, the, south, shore, where, fort, on, shore, was, constructed, it, proved, insufficient, within, 3, years, and, the, mighty, fort, nelson, was, constructed, upriver, the, town, of, louisville, was, chartered, in, 1780, in, honor, of, king, louis, xvi, of, france, the, first, locks, on, the, river, the, louisville, and, portland, canal, were, built, between, 1825, and, 1830, to, circumnavigate, the, falls, fears, that, louisville, s, transshipment, industry, would, collapse, proved, ill, founded, but, the, increasing, size, of, steamships, and, barges, on, the, river, meant, that, the, outdated, locks, could, serve, only, the, smallest, vessels, until, well, after, the, civil, war, when, improvements, were, made, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, improvements, were, expanded, again, in, the, 1960s, forming, the, present, day, mcalpine, locks, and, dam, during, the, nineteenth, century, emigrants, from, virginia, north, carolina, and, kentucky, traveled, by, the, river, and, settled, along, its, northern, bank, known, as, butternuts, they, formed, the, dominant, culture, in, the, southern, portions, of, ohio, indiana, and, illinois, with, a, society, that, was, primarily, southern, in, culture, largely, devoted, to, agricultural, pursuits, they, shipped, much, of, their, produce, along, the, river, to, ports, such, as, cincinnati, because, the, ohio, river, flowed, westward, it, became, a, convenient, means, of, westward, movement, by, pioneers, traveling, from, western, pennsylvania, after, reaching, the, mouth, of, the, ohio, settlers, would, travel, north, on, the, mississippi, river, to, st, louis, missouri, there, some, continued, on, up, the, missouri, river, some, up, the, mississippi, and, some, farther, west, over, land, routes, in, the, early, 19th, century, river, pirates, such, as, samuel, mason, operating, out, of, cave, in, rock, illinois, waylaid, travelers, on, their, way, down, the, river, they, killed, travelers, stealing, their, goods, and, scuttling, their, boats, the, folktales, about, mike, fink, recall, the, keelboats, used, for, commerce, in, the, early, days, of, american, settlement, the, ohio, river, boatmen, inspired, performer, dan, emmett, who, in, 1843, wrote, the, song, the, boatman, s, dance, trading, boats, and, ships, traveled, south, on, the, mississippi, to, new, orleans, and, sometimes, beyond, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, other, ports, in, the, americas, and, europe, this, provided, a, much, needed, export, route, for, goods, from, the, west, since, the, trek, east, over, the, appalachian, mountains, was, long, and, arduous, the, need, for, access, to, the, port, of, new, orleans, by, settlers, in, the, ohio, valley, is, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, the, united, states, louisiana, purchase, in, 1803, because, the, river, is, the, southern, border, of, ohio, indiana, and, illinois, it, was, part, of, the, border, between, free, states, and, slave, states, in, the, years, before, the, american, civil, war, one, antebellum, slave, trader, reported, that, they, kept, slaves, chained, two, by, two, while, navigating, the, ohio, only, when, they, reached, the, mississippi, could, the, slaves, be, unchained, for, a, time, because, there, was, slavery, on, both, sides, of, the, boat, the, expression, sold, down, the, river, originated, as, a, lament, of, upper, south, slaves, especially, from, kentucky, who, were, shipped, via, the, ohio, and, mississippi, to, cotton, and, sugar, plantations, in, the, deep, south, changes, in, crops, cultivated, in, the, upper, south, resulted, in, slaves, available, to, be, sold, to, the, south, where, the, expansion, of, cotton, plantations, was, doing, very, well, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, made, cultivation, of, short, staple, cotton, profitable, throughout, the, black, belt, of, this, region, before, and, during, the, civil, war, the, ohio, river, was, called, the, river, jordan, by, slaves, crossing, it, to, escape, to, freedom, in, the, north, via, the, underground, railroad, more, escaping, slaves, estimated, in, the, thousands, made, their, perilous, journey, north, to, freedom, across, the, ohio, river, than, anywhere, else, across, the, north, south, frontier, harriet, beecher, stowe, s, uncle, tom, s, cabin, the, bestselling, novel, that, fueled, abolitionist, work, was, the, best, known, of, the, anti, slavery, novels, that, portrayed, such, escapes, across, the, ohio, the, times, have, been, expressed, by, 20th, century, novelists, as, well, such, as, the, nobel, prize, winning, toni, morrison, whose, novel, beloved, was, adapted, as, a, film, of, the, same, name, she, also, composed, the, libretto, for, the, opera, margaret, garner, 2005, based, on, the, life, and, trial, of, an, enslaved, woman, who, escaped, with, her, family, across, the, river, the, colonial, charter, for, virginia, defined, its, territory, as, extending, to, the, north, shore, of, the, ohio, so, that, the, riverbed, was, owned, by, virginia, where, the, river, serves, as, a, boundary, between, states, today, congress, designated, the, entire, river, to, belong, to, the, states, on, the, east, and, south, i, e, west, virginia, and, kentucky, at, the, time, of, admission, to, the, union, that, were, divided, from, virginia, thus, wheeling, island, the, largest, inhabited, island, in, the, ohio, river, belongs, to, west, virginia, although, it, is, closer, to, the, ohio, shore, than, to, the, west, virginia, shore, kentucky, sued, the, state, of, indiana, in, the, early, 1980s, because, of, their, construction, of, the, never, completed, marble, hill, nuclear, power, plant, in, indiana, which, would, have, discharged, its, waste, water, into, the, river, this, would, have, adversely, affected, kentucky, s, water, supplies, the, u, s, supreme, court, held, that, kentucky, s, jurisdiction, and, implicitly, that, of, west, virginia, extended, only, to, the, low, water, mark, of, 1793, important, because, the, river, has, been, extensively, dammed, for, navigation, so, that, the, present, river, bank, is, north, of, the, old, low, water, mark, similarly, in, the, 1990s,

in, the, united, states, based, on, 2009, and, 2010, data, the, more, industrial, and, regional, west, virginia, pennsylvania, tributary, the, monongahela, river, ranked, 17th, for, water, pollution, behind, 16, other, american, rivers, the, ohio, again, ranked, as, the, most, polluted, in, 2013, and, has, been, the, most, polluted, river, since, at, least, 2001, according, to, the, ohio, river, valley, water, sanitation, commission, orsanco, the, commission, found, that, 92, of, toxic, discharges, were, nitrates, including, farm, runoff, and, waste, water, from, industrial, processes, such, as, steel, production, the, commission, also, noted, mercury, pollution, as, an, ongoing, concern, citing, a, 500, increase, in, mercury, discharges, between, 2007, and, 2013, for, several, decades, beginning, in, the, 1950s, the, ohio, river, was, polluted, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, pounds, of, pfoa, a, fluoride, based, chemical, used, in, making, teflon, among, other, things, by, the, dupont, chemical, company, from, an, outflow, pipe, at, its, parkersburg, west, virginia, facility, the, ohio, was, listed, among, america, s, most, endangered, rivers, of, 2023, on, the, heels, of, contamination, from, a, high, profile, train, derailment, and, following, years, as, one, of, the, most, polluted, watersheds, in, the, united, states, the, ohio, river, is, extensively, industrialized, and, populated, regular, barge, traffic, carries, cargoes, of, oil, steel, and, other, industrial, goods, produced, in, the, region, major, cities, located, along, the, northern, and, southern, banks, of, the, river, include, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, louisville, kentucky, evansville, indiana, and, cincinnati, ohio, the, combined, allegheny, ohio, river, is, 1, 310, miles, 2, 110, km, long, and, carries, the, largest, volume, of, water, of, any, tributary, of, the, mississippi, the, indians, and, early, european, explorers, and, settlers, of, the, region, often, considered, the, allegheny, to, be, part, of, the, ohio, the, forks, the, confluence, of, the, allegheny, and, monongahela, rivers, at, what, is, now, pittsburgh, were, considered, a, strategic, military, location, by, colonial, french, and, british, and, later, independent, american, military, authorities, the, ohio, river, is, formed, by, the, confluence, of, the, allegheny, and, monongahela, rivers, at, what, is, now, point, state, park, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, from, there, it, flows, northwest, through, allegheny, and, beaver, counties, before, making, an, abrupt, turn, to, the, south, southwest, at, the, west, virginia, ohio, pennsylvania, triple, state, line, near, east, liverpool, ohio, chester, west, virginia, and, ohioville, pennsylvania, from, there, it, forms, the, border, between, west, virginia, and, ohio, upstream, of, wheeling, west, virginia, the, river, follows, a, roughly, southwest, and, then, west, northwest, course, until, cincinnati, before, bending, to, a, west, southwest, course, for, most, of, the, remainder, of, its, length, the, course, forms, the, northern, borders, of, west, virginia, and, kentucky, and, the, southern, borders, of, ohio, indiana, and, illinois, until, it, joins, the, mississippi, river, at, the, city, of, cairo, illinois, where, the, ohio, joins, the, mississippi, is, the, lowest, elevation, in, the, state, of, illinois, at, 315, feet, 96, m, the, mississippi, river, flows, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, on, the, atlantic, ocean, among, rivers, wholly, or, mostly, in, the, united, states, the, ohio, is, the, second, largest, by, discharge, volume, and, the, tenth, longest, and, has, the, eighth, largest, drainage, basin, it, serves, to, separate, the, midwestern, great, lakes, states, from, the, upper, south, states, which, were, historically, border, states, in, the, civil, war, the, ohio, river, is, a, left, east, and, the, largest, tributary, by, volume, of, the, mississippi, river, in, the, united, states, at, the, confluence, the, ohio, is, considerably, bigger, than, the, mississippi, measured, by, long, term, mean, discharge, the, ohio, river, at, cairo, is, 281, 500, cu, ft, s, 7, 960, m, 3, s, and,

mississippi, river, so, hydrologically, the, ohio, river, is, the, main, stream, of, the, river, system, the, ohio, river, is, a, naturally, shallow, river, that, was, artificially, deepened, by, a, series, of, dams, the, natural, depth, of, the, river, varied, from, about, 3, to, 20, feet, 1, to, 6, m, the, dams, raise, the, water, level, and, have, turned, the, river, largely, into, a, series, of, reservoirs, eliminating, shallow, stretches, and, allowing, for, commercial, navigation, from, its, origin, to, cincinnati, the, average, depth, is, approximately, 15, feet, 5, m, the, largest, immediate, drop, in, water, level, is, below, the, mcalpine, locks, and, dam, at, the, falls, of, the, ohio, at, louisville, kentucky, where, flood, stage, is, reached, when, the, water, reaches, 23,

regions, the, ohio, river, is, a, climatic, transition, area, as, its, water, runs, along, the, periphery, of, the, humid, continental, and, humid, subtropical, climate, areas, it, is, inhabited, by, fauna, and, flora, of, both, climates, in, winter, it, regularly, freezes, over, at, pittsburgh, but, rarely, farther, south, toward, cincinnati, and, louisville, at, paducah, kentucky, in, the, south, at, the, ohio, s, confluence, with, the, tennessee, river, it, is, ice, free, year, round, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, 2016, update, of, climate, zones, the, humid, subtropical, zone, has, stretched, across, the, river, into, the, southern, portions, of, ohio, indiana, and, illinois, from, a, geological, standpoint, the, ohio, river, is, young, before, the, river, was, created, large, parts, of, north, america, were, covered, by, water, forming, a, saltwater, lake, about, 200, miles, across, and, 400, miles, in, length, the, bedrock, of, the, ohio, valley, was, mostly, set, during, this, time, the, river, formed, on, a, piecemeal, basis, beginning, between, 2, 5, and, 3, million, years, ago, by, the, movement, of, glaciers, during, the, earliest, ice, ages, the, contemporary, river, drainages, of, the, kanawha, sandy, kentucky, green, cumberland, and, tennessee, rivers, northward, created, the, ohio, system, and, the, course, of, early, tributaries, of, the, ohio, river, including, the, monongahela, and, the, allegheny, rivers, were, set, the, teays, river, was, the, largest, of, these, rivers, the, modern, ohio, river, flows, within, segments, of, the, ancient, teays, the, ancient, rivers, were, rearranged, or, consumed, the, section, of, the, river, that, runs, southwest, from, pittsburgh, to, cairo, illinois, is, around, tens, of, thousands, of, years, old, the, upper, ohio, river, formed, when, one, of, the, glacial, lakes, overflowed, into, a, south, flowing, tributary, of, the, teays, river, prior, to, that, event, the, north, flowing, steubenville, river, no, longer, in, existence, ended, between, new, martinsville, and, paden, city, west, virginia, the, south, flowing, marietta, river, no, longer, in, existence, ended, between, the, present, day, cities, the, overflowing, lake, carved, through, the, separating, hill, and, connected, the, rivers, the, floodwaters, enlarged, the, small, marietta, valley, to, a, size, more, typical, of, a, large, river, the, new, large, river, subsequently, drained, glacial, lakes, and, melting, glaciers, at, the, end, of, the, ice, ages, the, valley, grew, during, and, following, the, ice, age, many, small, rivers, were, altered, or, abandoned, after, the, upper, ohio, river, formed, valleys, of, some, abandoned, rivers, can, still, be, seen, on, satellite, and, aerial, images, of, the, hills, of, ohio, and, west, virginia, between, marietta, ohio, and, huntington, west, virginia, the, middle, ohio, river, formed, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, the, upper, ohio, river, a, north, flowing, river, was, temporarily, dammed, by, natural, forces, southwest, of, present, day, louisville, creating, a, large, lake, until, the, dam, burst, a, new, route, was, carved, to, the, mississippi, eventually, the, upper, and, middle, sections, combined, to, form, what, is, essentially, the, modern, ohio, river, along, the, banks, of, the, ohio, are, some, of, the, largest, cities,
