department, situated, on, the, pirai, river, in, the, eastern, tropical, lowlands, of, bolivia, the, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, metropolitan, region, is, the, most, populous, urban, agglomeration, in, bolivia, with, an, estimated, population, of, 2, 4, million, in, 2020, it, is, formed, out, of, a, conurbation, of, seven, santa, cruz, municipalities, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, la, guardia, warnes, cotoca, el, torno, porongo, and, montero, the, city, was, first, founded, in, 1561, by, spanish, explorer, uflo, de, chavez, about, 200, km, 124, mi, east, of, its, current, location, and, was, moved, several, times, until, it, was, finally, established, on, the, pirai, river, in, the, late, 16th, century, for, much, of, its, history, santa, cruz, was, mostly, a, small, outpost, town, and, even, after, bolivia, gained, its, independence, in, 1825, there, was, little, attention, from, the, authorities, or, the, population, in, general, to, settle, the, region, it, was, not, until, after, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, with, profound, agrarian, and, land, reforms, that, the, city, began, to, grow, at, a, very, fast, pace, due, to, its, low, elevation, at, the, foothills, of, the, andes, and, being, situated, in, the, amazon, basin, the, city, has, a, tropical, climate, unlike, the, other, main, metro, area, of, la, paz, that, is, thousands, of, meters, higher, in, terms, of, elevation, santa, cruz, is, bolivia, s, most, populous, city, produces, nearly, 35, of, bolivia, s, gross, domestic, product, and, receives, over, 40, of, all, foreign, direct, investment, in, the, country, the, city, is, the, most, important, business, center, in, bolivia, and, the, country, s, principal, destination, for, national, and, international, migrants, like, much, of, the, history, of, the, people, of, the, region, the, history, of, the, area, before, the, arrival, of, european, explorers, is, not, well, documented, mostly, because, of, the, somewhat, nomadic, nature, and, the, absence, of, a, written, language, in, the, culture, of, the, local, tribes, however, recent, data, suggests, that, the, current, location, of, the, city, of, santa, cruz, was, inhabited, by, an, arawak, tribe, that, later, came, to, be, known, by, the, spanish, as, chan, remains, of, ceramics, and, weapons, have, been, found, in, the, area, leading, researchers, to, believe, they, had, established, settlements, in, the, area, among, the, few, known, facts, of, these, tribes, according, to, accounts, of, the, first, spanish, explorers, that, came, into, contact, with, the, chan, are, that, they, had, a, formal, leader, a, cacique, called, grigot, for, several, years, but, his, reign, came, to, an, end, after, one, of, the, several, guarani, chiriguano, incursions, in, the, area, the, first, europeans, to, set, foot, in, the, area, were, spanish, conquistadores, from, the, recently, created, governorate, of, new, andalusia, that, encompassed, the, territories, of, present, day, argentina, uruguay, paraguay, and, chile, in, 1549, captain, general, domingo, martinez, de, irala, became, the, first, spaniard, to, explore, the, region, but, it, was, not, until, 1558, that, uflo, de, chavez, who, had, arrived, in, asunci, n, in, 1541, with, lvar, n, ez, cabeza, de, vaca, led, a, new, expedition, with, the, objective, of, settling, the, region, after, discovering, that, a, new, expedition, from, asuncion, was, already, underway, he, quickly, traveled, to, lima, and, successfully, persuaded, the, viceroy, to, create, a, new, province, and, grant, him, the, title, of, governor, on, february, 15, 1560, upon, returning, from, lima, chavez, founded, the, city, of, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, holy, cross, of, the, hills, on, february, 26, 1561, 220, km, 137, mi, east, of, its, present, day, location, to, function, as, the, capital, of, the, newly, formed, province, of, moxos, and, chaves, the, settlement, was, named, after, chaves, s, home, town, in, extremadura, where, he, grew, up, before, venturing, to, america, shortly, after, the, founding, attacks, from, local, tribes, became, commonplace, and, uflo, de, chaves, was, killed, in, 1568, by, itatine, natives, after, chaves, s, death, the, conflicts, with, the, local, population, as, well, as, power, struggles, in, the, settlement, forced, the, authorities, in, peru, to, order, the, new, governor, lorenzo, suarez, de, figueroa, to, relocate, the, city, to, the, west, many, of, the, inhabitants, however, chose, to, stay, behind, and, continued, living, in, the, original, location, on, september, 13, 1590, the, city, was, officially, moved, to, the, banks, of, the, guapay, empero, river, and, renamed, san, lorenzo, de, la, frontera, nevertheless, the, conditions, proved, to, be, even, more, severe, at, the, new, location, forcing, the, settlers, to, relocate, once, again, on, may, 21, 1595, although, this, was, the, final, relocation, of, the, city, the, name, san, lorenzo, continued, to, be, used, until, the, early, 17th, century, when, the, settlers, who, remained, behind, in, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, were, convinced, by, the, colonial, authorities, to, move, to, san, lorenzo, after, they, moved, the, city, was, finally, consolidated, in, 1622, and, took, its, original, name, of, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, given, by, uflo, de, chaves, over, 60, years, before, remnants, of, the, original, settlement, can, be, visited, in, santa, cruz, la, vieja, old, santa, cruz, an, archaeological, site, south, of, san, jos, de, chiquitos, over, the, next, 200, years, several, tribes, were, either, incorporated, under, spanish, control, or, defeated, by, force, the, city, also, became, an, important, staging, point, for, jesuit, missions, to, chiquitos, and, moxos, leading, to, the, conversion, of, thousands, of, guaranies, moxe, os, chiquitanos, guarayos, and, chiriguanos, that, eventually, became, part, of, the, racially, mixed, population, of, the, modern, santa, cruz, beni, pando, and, tarija, departments, of, bolivia, another, important, role, the, small, town, played, in, the, region, for, the, spanish, empire, was, to, contain, the, incursions, of, portuguese, bandeirantes, many, of, which, were, repelled, by, the, use, of, force, over, the, years, the, efforts, for, consolidating, the, borders, of, the, empire, were, not, overlooked, by, the, authorities, in, lima, who, granted, the, province, a, great, degree, of, autonomy, the, province, was, ruled, by, a, captain, general, based, in, santa, cruz, and, in, turn, the, city, government, was, administered, by, two, mayors, and, a, council, of, four, people, citizens, of, santa, cruz, were, exempt, from, all, imperial, taxes, and, the, mita, system, used, in, the, rest, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, was, not, practiced, however, in, spite, of, its, strategic, importance, the, city, did, not, grow, much, in, colonial, times, most, of, the, economic, activity, was, centered, in, the, mining, centers, of, the, west, and, the, main, source, of, income, of, the, city, was, agriculture, animosity, towards, imperial, authorities, began, at, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, when, the, new, system, of, intendencias, reached, the, new, world, the, seat, of, government, was, taken, away, from, the, city, and, moved, to, cochabamba, and, many, of, the, powers, delegated, by, the, viceroyalty, were, now, in, the, hands, of, appointees, of, the, crown, like, in, many, parts, of, spanish, america, at, the, time, angered, by, the, reforms, the, criollos, saw, as, a, threat, to, their, way, of, life, and, taking, advantage, of, the, peninsular, war, the, local, population, led, by, antonio, vicente, seonane, revolted, on, september, 24, 1810, overthrowing, the, governor, delegate, a, junta, of, local, commanders, took, control, of, the, government, in, his, place, the, revolutionaries, as, it, was, the, case, with, most, of, the, revolts, in, spanish, america, remained, loyal, to, the, king, of, spain, while, repudiating, the, colonial, authorities, until, after, the, end, of, the, peninsular, war, by, 1813, the, city, was, once, again, under, imperial, control, at, this, time, by, order, of, general, manuel, belgrano, the, revolutionary, armies, of, argentina, sent, a, small, force, led, by, ignacio, warnes, to, liberate, santa, cruz, after, his, successful, campaign, he, assumed, control, of, the, government, of, the, city, in, a, little, over, a, year, warnes, was, able, to, gather, tremendous, support, from, the, population, enlisting, criollos, mestizos, and, natives, to, the, revolutionary, army, and, allying, with, the, revolutionary, leader, of, vallegrande, alvarez, de, arenales, to, defeat, a, strong, imperial, force, in, the, battle, of, florida, this, victory, proved, to, be, a, serious, blow, to, spanish, forces, in, the, region, nevertheless, two, years, after, the, victory, of, florida, imperial, forces, launched, a, new, offensive, in, the, province, led, by, francisco, javier, aguilera, this, campaign, ended, with, the, defeat, and, death, of, ignacio, warnes, and, his, forces, in, the, battle, of, pari, triumphant, aguilera, marched, into, the, city, with, orders, to, quell, the, insurrection, and, reinstate, the, spanish, governor, this, proved, to, be, a, very, difficult, task, with, several, revolutionary, leaders, such, as, jose, manuel, ca, oto, baca, and, jose, manuel, mercado, rising, up, in, the, coming, years, from, the, city, itself, and, elsewhere, in, the, province, these, new, leaders, fought, colonial, authorities, for, seven, years, until, they, finally, deposed, the, last, spanish, governor, manuel, fernando, aramburu, in, february, 1825, after, news, of, the, defeat, of, the, imperial, armies, in, the, west, had, reached, the, city, the, city, is, located, in, the, eastern, part, of, bolivia, 17, 45, south, 63, 14, west, at, around, 400, m,

bolivia, catholicism, as, well, as, the, spanish, language, were, implemented, onto, the, natives, which, is, now, why, the, city, is, predominantly, catholic, and, speak, spanish, nevertheless,
