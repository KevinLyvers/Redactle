west, africa, or, western, africa, is, the, westernmost, region, of, africa, the, united, nations, defines, western, africa, as, the, 16, countries, of, benin, burkina, faso, cape, verde, the, gambia, ghana, guinea, guinea, bissau, ivory, coast, liberia, mali, mauritania, niger, nigeria, senegal, sierra, leone, and, togo, as, well, as, saint, helena, ascension, and, tristan, da, cunha, united, kingdom, overseas, territory, the, population, of, west, africa, is, estimated, at, 419, million, people, as, of, 2021, and, at, 381, 981, 000, as, of, 2017, of, which, 189, 672, 000, were, female, and, 192, 309, 000, male, the, region, is, demographically, and, economically, one, of, the, fastest, growing, on, the, african, continent, early, history, in, west, africa, included, a, number, of, prominent, regional, powers, that, dominated, different, parts, of, both, the, coastal, and, internal, trade, networks, such, as, the, mali, and, gao, empires, west, africa, sat, at, the, intersection, of, trade, routes, between, arab, dominated, north, africa, and, further, south, on, the, continent, the, source, of, specialized, goods, such, as, gold, advanced, iron, working, and, ivory, after, european, exploration, encountered, rich, local, economies, and, kingdoms, the, atlantic, slave, trade, built, on, already, existing, slave, systems, to, provide, labor, for, colonies, in, the, americas, after, the, end, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, early, 19th, century, european, nations, especially, france, and, britain, continued, to, exploit, the, region, through, colonial, relationships, for, example, they, continued, exporting, a, number, of, extractive, goods, including, labor, intensive, agricultural, crops, like, cocoa, and, coffee, forestry, products, like, tropical, timber, and, mineral, resources, like, gold, since, independence, many, west, african, countries, like, ivory, coast, ghana, nigeria, and, senegal, have, played, important, roles, in, the, regional, and, global, economies, west, africa, has, a, rich, ecology, with, strong, biodiversity, and, several, distinct, regions, the, area, s, climate, and, ecology, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, dry, sahara, to, the, north, and, east, which, provides, dry, winds, during, the, harmattan, as, well, as, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, south, and, west, which, provides, seasonal, monsoons, this, mixture, of, climates, gives, west, africa, a, rich, array, of, biomes, from, biodiversity, rich, tropical, forests, to, drylands, supporting, rare, and, endangered, fauna, such, as, pangolins, rhinoceros, and, elephants, because, of, the, pressure, for, economic, development, many, of, these, ecologies, are, threatened, by, processes, like, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, overfishing, pollution, from, mining, plastics, and, other, industries, and, extreme, changes, resulting, from, climate, change, in, west, africa, the, history, of, west, africa, can, be, divided, into, five, major, periods, first, its, prehistory, in, which, the, first, human, settlers, arrived, developed, agriculture, and, made, contact, with, peoples, to, the, north, the, second, the, iron, age, empires, that, consolidated, both, intra, africa, and, extra, africa, trade, and, developed, centralized, states, third, major, polities, flourished, which, would, undergo, an, extensive, history, of, contact, with, non, africans, fourth, the, colonial, period, in, which, great, britain, and, france, controlled, nearly, the, entire, region, and, fifth, the, post, independence, era, in, which, the, current, nations, were, formed, west, african, populations, were, considerably, mobile, and, interacted, with, one, another, throughout, the, population, history, of, west, africa, acheulean, tool, using, archaic, humans, may, have, dwelled, throughout, west, africa, since, at, least, between, 780, 000, bp, and, 126, 000, bp, middle, pleistocene, during, the, pleistocene, middle, stone, age, peoples, e, g, iwo, eleru, people, possibly, aterians, who, dwelled, throughout, west, africa, between, mis, 4, and, mis, 2, were, gradually, replaced, by, incoming, late, stone, age, peoples, who, migrated, into, west, africa, as, an, increase, in, humid, conditions, resulted, in, the, subsequent, expansion, of, the, west, african, forest, west, african, hunter, gatherers, occupied, western, central, africa, e, g, shum, laka, earlier, than, 32, 000, bp, dwelled, throughout, coastal, west, africa, by, 12, 000, bp, and, migrated, northward, between, 12, 000, bp, and, 8000, bp, as, far, as, mali, burkina, faso, and, mauritania, during, the, holocene, niger, congo, speakers, independently, created, pottery, in, ounjougou, mali, the, earliest, pottery, in, africa, by, at, least, 9400, bce, and, along, with, their, pottery, as, well, as, wielding, independently, invented, bows, and, arrows, migrated, into, the, central, sahara, which, became, their, primary, region, of, residence, by, 10, 000, bp, the, emergence, and, expansion, of, ceramics, in, the, sahara, may, be, linked, with, the, origin, of, round, head, and, kel, essuf, rock, art, which, occupy, rockshelters, in, the, same, regions, e, g, djado, acacus, tadrart, hunters, in, the, central, sahara, farmed, stored, and, cooked, undomesticated, central, saharan, flora, underwent, domestication, of, antelope, and, domesticated, and, shepherded, barbary, sheep, after, the, kel, essuf, period, and, round, head, period, of, the, central, sahara, the, pastoral, period, followed, some, of, the, hunter, gatherers, who, created, the, round, head, rock, art, may, have, adopted, pastoral, culture, and, others, may, have, not, as, a, result, of, increasing, aridification, of, the, green, sahara, central, saharan, hunter, gatherers, and, cattle, herders, may, have, used, seasonal, waterways, as, the, migratory, route, taken, to, the, niger, river, and, chad, basin, of, west, africa, in, 2000, bce, thiaroye, woman, also, known, as, the, venus, of, thiaroye, may, have, been, the, earliest, statuette, created, in, sub, saharan, west, africa, it, may, have, particularly, been, a, fertility, statuette, created, in, the, region, of, senegambia, and, may, be, associated, with, the, emergence, of, complexly, organized, pastoral, societies, in, west, africa, between, 4000, bce, and, 1000, bce, though, possibly, developed, as, early, as, 5000, bce, nsibidi, may, have, also, developed, in, 2000, bce, as, evidenced, by, depictions, of, the, west, african, script, on, ikom, monoliths, at, ikom, in, nigeria, migration, of, saharan, peoples, south, of, the, sahelian, region, resulted, in, seasonal, interaction, with, and, gradual, absorption, of, west, african, hunter, gatherers, who, primarily, dwelt, in, the, savannas, and, forests, of, west, africa, in, west, africa, which, may, have, been, a, major, regional, cradle, in, africa, for, the, domestication, of, crops, and, animals, niger, congo, speakers, domesticated, the, helmeted, guineafowl, between, 5500, bp, and, 1300, bp, domestication, of, field, crops, occurred, throughout, various, locations, in, west, africa, such, as, yams, d, praehensilis, in, the, niger, river, basin, between, eastern, ghana, and, western, nigeria, northern, benin, rice, oryza, glaberrima, in, the, inner, niger, delta, region, of, mali, pearl, millet, cenchrus, americanus, in, northern, mali, and, mauritania, and, cowpeas, in, northern, ghana, after, having, persisted, as, late, as, 1000, bp, or, some, period, of, time, after, 1500, ce, remaining, west, african, hunter, gatherers, many, of, whom, dwelt, in, the, forest, savanna, region, were, ultimately, acculturated, and, admixed, into, the, larger, groups, of, west, african, agriculturalists, akin, to, the, migratory, bantu, speaking, agriculturalists, and, their, encounters, with, central, african, hunter, gatherers, the, development, of, the, region, s, economy, allowed, more, centralized, states, and, civilizations, to, form, beginning, with, dhar, tichitt, that, began, in, 1600, b, c, followed, by, djenn, djenno, beginning, in, 300, b, c, this, was, then, succeeded, by, the, ghana, empire, that, first, flourished, roughly, between, the, 2nd, and, 12th, centuries, c, e, which, later, gave, way, to, the, mali, empire, in, current, day, mauritania, there, exist, archaeological, sites, in, the, towns, of, tichit, and, oualata, that, were, initially, constructed, around, 2000, b, c, and, were, found, to, have, originated, from, the, soninke, branch, of, the, mand, peoples, also, based, on, the, archaeology, of, the, city, of, kumbi, saleh, in, modern, day, mauritania, the, mali, empire, came, to, dominate, much, of, the, region, until, its, defeat, by,

the, void, but, was, defeated, c, 1240, by, the, mandinka, forces, of, sundiata, keita, founder, of, the, new, mali, empire, the, mali, empire, continued, to, flourish, for, several, centuries, most, particularly, under, sundiata, s, grandnephew, musa, i, before, a, succession, of, weak, rulers, led, to, its, collapse, under, mossi, tuareg, and, songhai, invaders, in, the, 15th, century, the, songhai, would, form, a, new, dominant, state, based, on, gao, in, the, songhai, empire, under, the, leadership, of, sonni, ali, and, askia, mohammed, meanwhile, south, of, the, sudan, strong, city,

republic, of, benin, established, in, the, 14th, century, the, oyo, empire, grew, to, become, one, of, the, largest, west, african, states, it, rose, through, the, outstanding, organizational, skills, of, the, yoruba, wealth, gained, from, trade, and, its, powerful, cavalry, the, oyo, empire, was, the, most, politically, important, state, in, the, region, from, the, mid, 17th, to, the, late, 18th, century, holding, sway, not, only, over, most, of, the, other, kingdoms, in, yorubaland, but, also, over, nearby, african, states, notably, the, fon, kingdom, of, dahomey, in, the, modern, republic,

numeracy, level, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, reason, for, such, a, growth, was, predetermined, by, a, number, of, factors, namely, the, peanut, production, and, trade, which, was, boosted, by, the, demand, of, the, colonial, states, importantly, the, rise, of, the, numeracy, was, higher, in, the, regions, which, were, less, hierarchical, and, had, less, dependent, from, the, slavery,

british, killed, most, of, the, wildlife, particularly, the, lions, using, their, body, parts, as, trophies, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, senegambia, region, had, lost, most, of, its, lion, population, and, other, exotic, animals, due, to, poaching, by, the, 1930s, the, gambian, elephant, population, became, extinct, that, phenomenon, was, not, only, limited, to, the, senegambia, region, but, affected, much, of, west, africa, as, the, region, lost, much, of, its, natural, resources, once, tied, so, closely, to, its, cultural, identity, poaching, has, stolen, most, of, its, wildlife, the, british, issued, poaching, licenses, and, although, they, would, later, try, to, reverse, the, damage, that, had, been, done, by, attempting, to, preserve, what, was, left, of, the, local, wildlife, but, by, that, time, it, was, too, late, during, the, 1930s, the, elephant, population, in, the, gold, coast, was, about, 300, and, sierra, leone, between, 500, and, 600, although, a, small, number, of, elephants, survived, in, nigeria, hunting, agricultural, expansion, and, clearing, of, forest, in, that, country, drastically, affected, its, wildlife, population, particularly, elephants, despite, the, historical, damage, that, has, been, done, to, the, region, s, wildlife, populations, there, are, still, some, protected, nature, reserves, within, the, region, some, of, these, include, west, africa, is, also, home, to, several, baobab, trees, and, other, plant, life, some, baobab, trees, are, several, centuries, old, and, form, part, of, the, local, folklore, for, example, a, mythical, baobab, tree, named, ngoye, njuli, in, senegal, which, is, regarded, as, a, sacred, site, by, the, serer, the, tree, itself, is, rather, majestic, and, looks, like, a, huge, phallus, and, a, deformed, animal, or, thing, is, protruding, from, it, it, is, said, to, be, the, dwelling, place, of, a, pangool, ngoye, njuli, is, protected, by, the, senegalese, authorities, and, attracts, visitors, in, west, africa, as, in, other, parts, of, africa, where, the, baobab, tree, is, found, the, leaves, are, mixed, with, couscous, and, eaten, the, bark, of, the, tree, is, used, to, make, ropes, and, the, fruit, and, seeds, used, for, drinks, and, oils, west, africa, is, greatly, affected, by, deforestation, and, has, one, of, worst, deforestation, rate, even, the, beloved, baobab, tree, which, is, viewed, as, sacred, by, some, west, african, cultures, are, under, threat, due, to, climate, change, urbanization, and, population, growth, huge, swaths, of, forest, are,

nations, ranked, nigeria, as, the, state, with, the, worst, deforestation, rate, in, the, entire, world, causes, include, logging, subsistence, agriculture, and, the, collection, of, fuelwoods, according, to, a, thoughtco, publication, authored, steve, nix, 2018, almost, 90, percent, of, west, africa, s, original, rainforest, has, been, destroyed, and, the, rest, heavily, fragmented, and, in, a, degraded, state, being, poorly, used, overfishing, is, a, major, issue, in, west, africa, besides, reducing, fish, stocks, in, the, region, it, also, threatens, food, security, and, the, livelihoods, of, many, coastal, communities, who, largely, depend, on, artisanal, fishing, the, overfishing, generally, comes, from, foreign, trawlers, operating, in, the, region, to, combat, the, overfishing, greenpeace, has, recommended, countries, reduce, the, number, of, registered, trawlers, operating, in, african, waters, increase, the, monitoring, and, control, and, set, up, regional, fisheries, organizations, some, steps, have, already, been, taken, in, the, form, of, warfp, the, world, bank, s, west, africa, regional, fisheries, program, which, empowers, west, african, countries, i, e, liberia, sierra, leone, cape, verde, and, senegal, with, information, training, and, monitoring, systems, furthermore, liberia, enacted, a, fisheries, regulations, act, in, 2010, and, installed, a, satellite, based, monitoring, system, and, senegal, enacted, a, fisheries, code, in, 2015, in, cape, verde, the, fishermen, communities, of, palmiera, and, santa, maria, have, organized, themselves, to, protect, fishing, zones, mozambique, finally, created, a, conservation, area, including, a, coastline, west, africa, broadly, defined, to, include, the, western, portion, of, the, maghreb, western, sahara, morocco, algeria, and, tunisia, occupies, an, area, in, excess, of, 6, 140, 000, km, 2, or, approximately, one, fifth, of, africa, the, vast, majority, of, this, land, is,

northernmost, part, of, the, region, the, eastern, border, is, less, precise, with, some, placing, it, at, the, benue, trough, and, others, on, a, line, running, from, mount, cameroon, to, lake, chad, colonial, boundaries, are, reflected, in, the, modern, boundaries, between, contemporary, west, african, states, cutting, across, ethnic, and, cultural, lines, often, dividing, single, ethnic, groups, between, two, or, more, states, in, contrast, to, most, of, central, southern, and, southeast, africa, west, africa, is, not, populated, by, bantu, speaking, peoples, the, west, african, region, can, be, divided, into, four, climatic, sub, regions, namely, the, guinea, coast, soudano, sahel, sahel, extending, eastward, to, the, ethiopian, border, and, the, sahara, each, with, different, climatic, conditions, the, seasonal, cycle, of, rainfall, is, mainly, driven, by, the, south, north, movement, of, the, inter, tropical, convergence, zone, itcz, which, is, characterised, by, the, confluence,
