central, america, is, a, subregion, of, north, america, its, political, boundaries, are, defined, as, bordering, the, united, states, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, north, colombia, to, the, southeast, the, caribbean, sea, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, east, and, the, pacific, ocean, to, the, southwest, central, america, is, usually, defined, as, consisting, of, eight, countries, belize, costa, rica, el, salvador, guatemala, honduras, nicaragua, mexico, and, panama, within, central, america, is, the, mesoamerican, biodiversity, hotspot, which, extends, from, southern, mexico, to, southeastern, panama, due, to, the, presence, of, several, active, geologic, faults, and, the, central, america, volcanic, arc, there, is, a, high, amount, of, seismic, activity, in, the, region, such, as, volcanic, eruptions, and, earthquakes, which, has, resulted, in, death, injury, and, property, damage, in, the, pre, columbian, era, central, america, was, inhabited, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, mesoamerica, to, the, north, and, west, and, the, isthmo, colombian, peoples, to, the, south, and, east, following, the, spanish, expedition, of, christopher, columbus, voyages, to, the, americas, spain, began, to, colonize, the, americas, from, 1609, to, 1821, the, majority, of, central, american, territories, except, for, what, would, become, belize, and, panama, and, including, the, modern, mexican, state, of, chiapas, were, governed, by, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, from, mexico, city, as, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, on, 24, august, 1821, spanish, viceroy, juan, de, o, donoj, signed, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, which, established, new, spain, s, independence, from, spain, on, 15, september, 1821, the, act, of, independence, of, central, america, was, enacted, to, announce, central, america, s, separation, from, the, spanish, empire, and, provide, for, the, establishment, of, a, new, central, american, state, some, of, new, spain, s, provinces, in, the, central, american, region, i, e, what, would, become, guatemala, honduras, el, salvador, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, were, annexed, to, the, first, mexican, empire, however, in, 1823, they, seceded, from, mexico, to, form, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, until, 1838, in, 1838, costa, rica, guatemala, honduras, and, nicaragua, became, the, first, of, central, america, s, seven, states, to, become, independent, countries, followed, by, el, salvador, in, 1841, panama, in, 1903, and, belize, in, 1981, despite, the, dissolution, of, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, countries, like, costa, rica, el, salvador, guatemala, honduras, and, nicaragua, continue, to, maintain, a, central, american, identity, the, belizeans, are, usually, identified, as, culturally, caribbean, rather, than, central, american, while, the, panamanians, identify, themselves, more, broadly, with, their, south, american, neighbors, the, spanish, speaking, countries, officially, include, both, north, america, and, south, america, as, a, single, continent, am, rica, which, is, split, into, four, subregions, north, america, northern, america, and, mexico, central, america, south, america, and, insular, america, the, west, indies, central, america, may, mean, different, things, to, various, people, based, upon, different, contexts, central, america, was, formed, more, than, 3, million, years, ago, as, part, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, when, its, portion, of, land, connected, each, side, of, water, in, the, pre, columbian, era, the, northern, areas, of, central, america, were, inhabited, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, mesoamerica, most, notable, among, these, were, the, mayans, who, had, built, numerous, cities, throughout, the, region, and, the, aztecs, who, had, created, a, vast, empire, the, pre, columbian, cultures, of, eastern, el, salvador, eastern, honduras, caribbean, nicaragua, most, of, costa, rica, and, panama, were, predominantly, speakers, of, the, chibchan, languages, at, the, time, of, european, contact, and, are, considered, by, some, culturally, different, and, grouped, in, the, isthmo, colombian, area, following, the, spanish, expedition, of, christopher, columbus, s, voyages, to, the, americas, the, spanish, sent, many, expeditions, to, the, region, and, they, began, their, conquest, of, maya, territory, in, 1523, soon, after, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, spanish, conquistador, pedro, de, alvarado, commenced, the, conquest, of, northern, central, america, for, the, spanish, empire, beginning, with, his, arrival, in, soconusco, in, 1523, alvarado, s, forces, systematically, conquered, and, subjugated, most, of, the, major, maya, kingdoms, including, the, k, iche, tz, utujil, pipil, and, the, kaqchikel, by, 1528, the, conquest, of, guatemala, was, nearly, complete, with, only, the, pet, n, basin, remaining, outside, the, spanish, sphere, of, influence, the, last, independent, maya, kingdoms, the, kowoj, and, the, itza, people, were, finally, defeated, in, 1697, as, part, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, pet, n, in, 1538, spain, established, the, real, audiencia, of, panama, which, had, jurisdiction, over, all, land, from, the, strait, of, magellan, to, the, gulf, of, fonseca, this, entity, was, dissolved, in, 1543, and, most, of, the, territory, within, central, america, then, fell, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, audiencia, real, de, guatemala, this, area, included, the, current, territories, of, costa, rica, el, salvador, guatemala, honduras, nicaragua, and, the, mexican, state, of, chiapas, but, excluded, the, lands, that, would, become, belize, and, panama, the, president, of, the, audiencia, which, had, its, seat, in, antigua, guatemala, was, the, governor, of, the, entire, area, in, 1609, the, area, became, a, captaincy, general, and, the, governor, was, also, granted, the, title, of, captain, general, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, encompassed, most, of, central, america, with, the, exception, of, present, day, belize, and, panama, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, lasted, for, more, than, two, centuries, but, began, to, fray, after, a, rebellion, in, 1811, which, began, in, the, intendancy, of, san, salvador, the, captaincy, general, formally, ended, on, 15, september, 1821, with, the, signing, of, the, act, of, independence, of, central, america, mexican, independence, was, achieved, at, virtually, the, same, time, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, and, the, declaration, of, independence, of, the, mexican, empire, and, the, entire, region, was, finally, independent, from, spanish, authority, by, 28, september, 1821, from, its, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, until, 1823, the, former, captaincy, general, remained, intact, as, part, of, the, short, lived, first, mexican, empire, when, the, emperor, of, mexico, abdicated, on, 19, march, 1823, central, america, again, became, independent, on, 1, july, 1823, the, congress, of, central, america, peacefully, seceded, from, mexico, and, declared, absolute, independence, from, all, foreign, nations, and, the, region, formed, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, was, a, representative, democracy, with, its, capital, at, guatemala, city, this, union, consisted, of, the, provinces, of, costa, rica, el, salvador, guatemala, honduras, los, altos, mosquito, coast, and, nicaragua, the, lowlands, of, southwest, chiapas, including, soconusco, initially, belonged, to, the, republic, until, 1824, when, mexico, annexed, most, of, chiapas, and, began, its, claims, to, soconusco, the, republic, lasted, from, 1823, to, 1838, when, it, disintegrated, as, a, result, of, civil, wars, the, territory, that, now, makes, up, belize, was, heavily, contested, in, a, dispute, that, continued, for, decades, after, guatemala, achieved, independence, spain, and, later, guatemala, considered, this, land, a, guatemalan, department, in, 1862, britain, formally, declared, it, a, british, colony, and, named, it, british, honduras, it, became, independent, as, belize, in, 1981, panama, situated, in, the, southernmost, part, of, central, america, on, the, isthmus, of, panama, has, for, most, of, its, history, been, culturally, and, politically, linked, to, south, america, panama, was, part, of, the, province, of, tierra, firme, from, 1510, until, 1538, when, it, came, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, newly, formed, audiencia, real, de, panama, beginning, in, 1543, panama, was, administered, as, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, along, with, all, other, spanish, possessions, in, south, america, panama, remained, as, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, until, 1739, when, it, was, transferred, to, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, the, capital, of, which, was, located, at, santa, f, de, bogot, panama, remained, as, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, until, the, disestablishment, of, that, viceroyalty, in, 1819, a, series, of, military, and, political, struggles, took, place, from, that, time, until, 1822, the, result, of, which, produced, the, republic, of, gran, colombia, after, the, dissolution, of, gran, colombia, in, 1830, panama, became, part, of, a, successor, state, the, republic, of, new, granada, from, 1855, until, 1886, panama, existed, as, panama, state, first, within, the, republic, of, new, granada, then, within, the, granadine, confederation, and, finally, within, the, united, states, of, colombia, the, united, states, of, colombia, was, replaced, by, the, republic, of, colombia, in, 1886, as, part, of, the, republic, of, colombia, panama, state, was, abolished, and, it, became, the, isthmus, department, despite, the, many, political, reorganizations, colombia, was, still, deeply, plagued, by, conflict, which, eventually, led, to, the, secession, of, panama, on, 3, november, 1903, only, after, that, time, did, some, begin, to, regard, panama, as, a, north, or, central, american, entity, by, the, 1930s, the, united, fruit, company, owned, 14, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 5, million, acres, of, land, in, central, america, and, the, caribbean, and, was, the, single, largest, land, owner, in, guatemala, such, holdings, gave, it, great, power, over, the, governments, of, small, countries, that, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, the, coining, of, the, phrase, banana, republic, after, more, than, two, hundred, years, of, social, unrest, violent, conflict, and, revolution, central, america, today, remains, in, a, period, of, political, transformation, poverty, social, injustice, and, violence, are, still, widespread, nicaragua, is, the, second, poorest,

mountainous, spine, of, central, america, extending, from, the, sierra, madre, de, chiapas, in, mexico, s, chiapas, state, through, the, highlands, of, guatemala, el, salvador, and, honduras, to, central, nicaragua, the, pine, oak, forests, lie, between, 600, 1, 800, metres, 2, 000, 5, 900, ft, elevation, and, are, surrounded, at, lower, elevations, by, tropical, moist, forests, and, tropical, dry, forests, higher, elevations, above, 1, 800, metres, 5, 900, ft, are, usually, covered, with, central, american, montane, forests, the, central, american, pine, oak, forests, are, composed, of, many, species, characteristic, of, temperate, north, america, including, oak, pine, fir, and, cypress, laurel, forest, is, the, most, common, type, of, central, american, temperate, evergreen, cloud,

southeastern, honduras, there, are, cloud, forests, the, largest, located, near, the, border, with, nicaragua, in, nicaragua, cloud, forests, are, situated, near, the, border, with, honduras, but, many, were, cleared, to, grow, coffee, there, are, still, some, temperate, evergreen, hills, in, the, north, the, only, cloud, forest, in, the, pacific, coastal, zone, of, central, america, is, on, the, mombacho, volcano, in, nicaragua, in, costa, rica, there, are, laurel, forests, in, the, cordillera, de, tilar, n, and, volc, n, arenal, called, monteverde, also, in, the, cordillera, de, talamanca, the, central, american, montane, forests, are, an, ecoregion, of, the, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forests, biome, as, defined, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, these, forests, are, of, the, moist, deciduous, and, the, semi, evergreen, seasonal, subtype, of, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forests, and, receive, high, overall, rainfall, with, a, warm, summer, wet, season, and, a, cooler, winter, dry, season, central, american, montane, forests, consist, of, forest, patches, located, at, altitudes, ranging, from, 1, 800, 4, 000, metres, 5, 900, 13,

the, entire, ecoregion, covers, an, area, of, 13, 200, square, kilometers, 5, 100, sq, mi, and, has, a, temperate, climate, with, relatively, high, precipitation, levels, ecoregions, are, not, only, established, to, protect, the, forests, themselves, but, also, because, they, are, habitats, for, an, incomparably, rich, and, often, endemic, fauna, almost, half, of, the, bird, population, of, the, talamancan, montane, forests, in, costa, rica, and, panama, are, endemic, to, this, region, several, birds, are, listed, as, threatened, most, notably, the, resplendent, quetzal, pharomacrus, mocinno, three, wattled, bellbird, procnias, tricarunculata, bare, necked, umbrellabird, cephalopterus, glabricollis, and, black, guan, chamaepetes, unicolor, many, of, the, amphibians, are, endemic, and, depend, on, the, existence, of, forest, the, golden, toad, that, once, inhabited, a, small, region, in, the, monteverde, reserve, which, is, part, of, the, talamancan, montane, forests, has, not, been, seen, alive, since, 1989, and, is, listed, as, extinct, by, iucn, the, exact, causes, for, its, extinction, are, unknown, global, warming, may, have, played, a, role, because, the, development, of, that, frog, is, typical, for, this, area, may, have, been, compromised, seven, small, mammals, are, endemic, to, the, costa, rica, chiriqui, highlands, within, the, talamancan, montane, forest, region, jaguars, cougars, spider, monkeys, as, well, as, tapirs, and, anteaters, live, in, the, woods, of, central, america, the, central, american, red, brocket, is, a, brocket, deer, found, in, central, america, s, tropical, forest, central, america, is, geologically, very, active, with, volcanic, eruptions, and, earthquakes, occurring, frequently, and, tsunamis, occurring, occasionally, many, thousands, of, people, have, died, as, a, result, of, these, natural, disasters, most, of, central, america, rests, atop, the, caribbean, plate, this, tectonic, plate, converges, with, the, cocos, nazca, and, north, american, plates, to, form, the, middle, america, trench, a, major, subduction, zone, the, middle, america, trench, is, situated, some, 60, 160, kilometers, 37, 99, mi, off, the, pacific, coast, of, central, america, and, runs, roughly, parallel, to, it, many, large, earthquakes, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, seismic, activity, at, the, middle, america, trench, for, example, subduction, of, the, cocos, plate, beneath, the, north, american, plate, at, the, middle, america, trench, is, believed, to, have, caused, the, 1985, mexico, city, earthquake, that, killed, as, many, as, 40, 000, people, seismic, activity, at, the, middle, america, trench, is, also, responsible, for, earthquakes, in, 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, january, 2001, february, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and, many, other, earthquakes, throughout, central, america, the, middle, america, trench, is, not, the, only, source, of, seismic, activity, in, central, america, the, motagua, fault, is, an, onshore, continuation, of, the, cayman, trough, which, forms, part, of, the, tectonic, boundary, between, the, north, american, plate, and, the, caribbean, plate, this, transform, fault, cuts, right, across, guatemala, and, then, continues, offshore, until, it, merges, with, the, middle, america, trench, along, the, pacific, coast, of, mexico, near, acapulco, seismic, activity, at, the, motagua, fault, has, been, responsible, for, earthquakes, in, 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and, 2009, another, onshore, continuation, of, the, cayman, trough, is, the, chixoy, polochic, fault, which, runs, parallel, to, and, roughly, 80, kilometers, 50, mi, to, the, north, of, the, motagua, fault, though, less, active, than, the, motagua, fault, seismic, activity, at, the, chixoy, polochic, fault, is, still, thought, to, be, capable, of, producing, very, large, earthquakes, such, as, the, 1816, earthquake, of, guatemala, managua, the, capital, of, nicaragua, was, devastated, by, earthquakes, in, 1931, and, 1972, volcanic, eruptions, are, also, common, in, central, america, in, 1968, the, arenal, volcano, in, costa, rica, erupted, killing, 87, people, as, the, 3, villages, of, tabacon, pueblo, nuevo, and, san, luis, were, buried, under, pyroclastic, flows, and, debris, fertile, soils, from, weathered, volcanic, lava, have, made, it, possible, to, sustain, dense, populations, in, the, agriculturally, productive, highland, areas, list, of, countries, by, life, expectancy, at, birth, for, 2022, according, to, the, world, bank, group, list, of, central, american, countries, is, expanded, by, mexico, and, colombia, the, population, of, central, america, is, estimated, at, 50, 956, 791, as, of, 2021, with, an, area, of, 523, 780, square, kilometers, 202, 230, sq, mi, it, has, a, population, density, of, 97, 3, per, square, kilometre, 252, per, square, mile, human, development, index, values, are, from, the, estimates, for, 2017, the, official, language, majority, in, all,
