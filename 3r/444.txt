and, kings, benefited, while, the, common, people, bore, the, brunt, of, the, raiding, and, insecurity, if, a, noble, was, captured, they, were, likely, to, be, released, as, the, captors, whoever, they, were, would, generally, accept, a, ransom, in, exchange, for, freeing, them, 229, the, relationship, between, kings, and, european, traders, was, a, partnership, with, the, two, regularly, making, deals, on, how, the, trade, was, to, be, conducted, defining, who, could, be, enslaved, and, who, could, not, and, the, prices, of, the, slaves, contemporary, chroniclers, questioned, multiple, kings, on, their, part, in, the, slave, trade, and, noted, that, they, recognised, the, trade, as, evil, but, participated, because, otherwise, the, europeans, would, not, buy, any, other, goods, from, them, 230, 4, beginning, in, the, late, 18th, century, european, countries, gradually, began, slowing, and, or, abolishing, the, slave, trade, portugal, abandoned, slavery, in, 1869, and, brazil, in, 1888, but, a, system, of, contract, labor, replaced, it, that, was, only, barely, better, for, the, workers, 377, up, until, the, late, 1800s, portuguese, control, of, their, colony, outside, of, their, forts, and, trading, posts, was, a, fiction, guinea, bissau, became, the, scene, of, increased, european, colonial, competition, beginning, in, the, 1860s, the, dispute, over, the,
