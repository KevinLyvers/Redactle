angles, decrease, from, 23, to, less, than, 10, in, the, piedmont, scientists, have, identified, four, distinct, phases, of, volcanic, activity, in, the, formation, of, mount, fuji, the, first, phase, called, sen, komitake, is, composed, of, an, andesite, core, recently, discovered, deep, within, the, mountain, sen, komitake, was, followed, by, the, komitake, fuji, a, basalt, layer, believed, to, be, formed, several, hundred, thousand, years, ago, approximately, 100, 000, years, ago, old, fuji, was, formed, over, the, top, of, komitake, fuji, the, modern, new, fuji, is, believed, to, have, formed, over, the, top, of, old, fuji, around, 10, 000, years, ago, pre, komitake, started, erupting, in, the, middle, pleistocene, in, an, area, seven, km, 4, 1, 2, mi, north, of, mount, fuji, after, a, relatively, short, pause, eruptions, began, again, which, formed, komitake, volcano, in, the, same, location, these, eruptions, ended, 100, 000, years, ago, ashitake, volcano, was, active, from, 400, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, and, is, located, 20, km, 12, mi, southeast, of, mount, fuji, mount, fuji, started, erupting, 100, 000, years, ago, with, ko, fuji, old, fuji, forming, 100, 000, to, 17, 000, years, ago, but, which, is, now, almost, completely, buried, a, large, landslide, on, the, southwest, flank, occurred, about, 18, 000, years, ago, shin, fuji, new, fuji, eruptions, in, the, form, of, lava, lapilli, and, volcanic, ash, have, occurred, between, 17, 000, and, 8, 000, years, ago, between, 7, 000, and, 3, 500, years, ago, and, between, 4, 000, and, 2, 000, years, ago, flank, eruptions, mostly, in, the, form, of, parasitic, cinder, cones, ceased, in, 1707, the, largest, cone, omuro, yama, is, one, of, more, than, 100, cones, aligned, nw, se, and, ne, sw, through, the, summit, mt, fuji, also, has, more, than, 70, lava, tunnels, and, extensive, lava, tree, molds, two, large, landslides, are, at, the, head, of, the, yoshida, osawa, and, osawa, kuzure, valleys, as, of, december, 2002, the, volcano, is, classified, as, active, with, a, low, risk, of, eruption, the, last, recorded, eruption, was, the, h, ei, eruption, which, started, on, december, 16, 1707, h, ei, 4, 23rd, day, of, the, 11th, month, and, ended, about, january, 1, 1708, h, ei, 4, 9th, day, of, the, 12th, month, the, eruption, formed, a, new, crater, and, a, second, peak, named, mount, h, ei, halfway, down, its, southeastern, side, fuji, spewed, cinders, and, ash, which, fell, like, rain, in, izu, kai, sagami, and, musashi, since, then, there, have, been, no, signs, of, an, eruption, however, on, the, evening, of, march, 15, 2011, there, was, a, magnitude, 6, 2, earthquake, at, shallow, depth, a, few, kilometres, from, mount, fuji, on, its, southern, side, about, 11, 000, years, ago, a, large, amount, of, lava, began, to, erupt, from, the, west, side, of, the, top, of, the, ancient, fuji, mountain, this, lava, formed, the, new, fuji, which, is, the, main, body, of, mount, fuji, since, then, the, tops, of, the, ancient, fuji, and, the, new, fuji, are, side, by, side, about, 2, 500, 2, 800, years, ago, the, top, part, of, ancient, fuji, caused, a, large, scale, landslide, due, to, weathering, and, finally, only, the, top, of, shin, fuji, remained, there, are, ten, known, eruptions, that, can, be, traced, to, reliable, records, following, the, 2011, t, hoku, earthquake, there, was, speculation, in, the, media, that, the, shock, may, induce, volcanic, unrest, at, mount, fuji, in, september, 2012, mathematical, models, created, by, the, national, research, institute, for, earth, science, and, disaster, prevention, nriesdp, suggested, that, the, pressure, in, mount, fuji, s, magma, chamber, could, be, 1, 6, megapascals, higher, than, it, was, before, its, last, eruption, in, 1707, this, was, interpreted, by, some, media, outlets, to, mean, that, an, eruption, of, mount, fuji, could, be, imminent, however, since, there, is, no, known, method, of, directly, measuring, the, pressure, of, a, volcano, s, magma, chamber, indirect, calculations, of, the, type, used, by, nriesdp, are, speculative, and, unverifiable, other, indicators, suggestive, of, heightened, eruptive, danger, such, as, active, fumaroles, and, recently, discovered, faults, are, typical, occurrences, at, this, type, of, volcano, eruption, fears, continued, into, the, 2020s, in, 2021, a, new, hazard, map, was, created, to, help, residents, plan, for, evacuation, stoking, fears, because, of, its, increased, estimate, of, lava, flow, and, additional, vents, soon, afterwards, a, 4, 8, magnitude, earthquake, hit, the, area, sending, the, phrase, mt, fuji, eruption, trending, on, twitter, however, the, japan, meteorological, agency, assured, the, public, the, earthquake, did, not, increase, the, eruption, risk, in, 2023, a, new, evacuation, plan, was, developed, to, account, for, the, 2021, hazard, map, update, the, forest, at, the, northwest, base, of, the, mountain, is, named, aokigahara, folk, tales, and, legends, tell, of, ghosts, demons, y, rei, and, y, kai, haunting, the, forest, and, in, the, 19th, century, aokigahara, was, one, of, many, places, poor, families, abandoned, the, very, young, and, elderly, approximately, 30, suicides, have, been, counted, yearly, with, a, high, of, nearly, 80, bodies, in, 2002, the, recent, increase, in, suicides, prompted, local, officials, to, erect, signs, that, attempt, to, convince, individuals, experiencing, suicidal, intent, to, re, think, their, desperate, plans, and, sometimes, these, messages, have, proven, effective, the, numbers, of, suicides, in, the, past, creates, an, allure, that, has, persisted, across, the, span, of, decades, many, hikers, mark, their, routes, by, leaving, colored, plastic, tape, behind, as, they, pass, raising, concern, among, prefectural, officials, about, the, forest, s, ecosystem, the, closest, airport, with, scheduled, international, service, is, mt, fuji, shizuoka, airport, it, opened, in, june, 2009, it, is, about, 80, km, 50, mi, from, mount, fuji, the, major, international, airports, serving, tokyo, tokyo, international, airport, haneda, airport, in, tokyo, and, narita, international, airport, in, chiba, are, approximately, three, hours, and, 15, minutes, from, mount, fuji, approximately, 300, 000, people, climbed, mount, fuji, in, 2009, the, most, popular, period, for, people, to, hike, up, mount, fuji, is, from, july, to, august, while, huts, and, other, facilities, are, operating, and, the, weather, is, warmest, buses, to, the, trail, heads, typically, used, by, climbers, start, running, on, july, 1, climbing, from, october, to, may, is, very, strongly, discouraged, after, a, number, of, high, profile, deaths, and, severe, cold, weather, most, japanese, climb, the, mountain, at, night, in, order, to, be, in, a, position, at, or, near, the, summit, when, the, sun, rises, the, morning, light, is, called, goraik, arrival, of, light, there, are, four, major, routes, to, the, summit, each, has, numbered, stations, along, the, way, they, are, clockwise, starting, north, kawaguchiko, subashiri, gotemba, and, fujinomiya, routes, climbers, usually, start, at, the, fifth, stations, as, these, are, reachable, by, car, or, by, bus, the, summit, is, the, tenth, station, on, each, trail, the, stations, on, different, routes, are, at, different, elevations, the, highest, fifth, station, is, located, at, fujinomiya, followed, by, yoshida, subashiri, and, gotemba, there, are, four, additional, routes, from, the, foot, of, the, mountain, shojiko, yoshida, suyama, and, murayama, routes, even, though, it, has, only, the, second, highest, fifth, station, the, yoshida, route, is, the, most, popular, route, because, of, its, large, parking, area, and, many, large, mountain, huts, where, a, climber, can, rest, or, stay, during, the, summer, season, most, mount, fuji, climbing, tour, buses, arrive, there, the, next, popular, is, the, fujinomiya, route, which, has, the, highest, fifth, station, followed, by, subashiri, and, gotemba, the, ascent, from, the, new, fifth, station, can, take, anywhere, between, five, and, seven, hours, while, the, descent, can, take, from, three, to, four, hours, even, though, most, climbers, do, not, climb, the, subashiri, and, gotemba, routes, many, descend, these, because, of, their, ash, covered, paths, from, the, seventh, station, to, near, the, fifth, station, one, could, run, down, these, ash, covered, paths, in, approximately, 30, minutes, besides, these, routes, there, are, tractor, routes, along, the, climbing, routes, these, tractor, routes, are, used, to, bring, food, and, other, materials, to, huts, on, the, mountain, because, the, tractors, usually, take, up, most, of, the, width, of, these, paths, and, they, tend, to, push, large, rocks, from, the, side, of, the, path, the, tractor, paths, are, off, limits, to, the, climbers, on, sections, that, are, not, merged, with, the, climbing, or, descending, paths, nevertheless, one, can, sometimes, see, people, riding, mountain, bikes, along, the, tractor, routes, down, from, the, summit, this, is, particularly, risky, as, it, becomes, difficult, to, control, speed, and, may, send, some, rocks, rolling, along, the, side, of, the, path, which, may, hit, other, people, the, four, routes, from, the, foot, of, the, mountain, offer, historical, sites, the, murayama, is, the, oldest, route, and, the, yoshida, route, still, has, many, old, shrines, teahouses, and, huts, along, its, path, these, routes, are, gaining, popularity, recently, and, are, being, restored, but, climbing, from, the, foot, of, the, mountain, is, still, relatively, uncommon, bears, that, live, on, the, mountain, have, been, sighted, along, the, yoshida, route, huts, at, and, above, the, fifth, stations, are, usually, staffed, during, the, climbing, season, but, huts, below, fifth, stations, are, not, usually, staffed, for, climbers, the, number, of, open, huts, on, routes, are, proportional, to, the, number, of, climbers, yoshida, has, the, most, while, gotemba, has, the, fewest, the, huts, along, the, gotemba, route, also, tend, to, start, later, and, close, earlier, than, those, along, the, yoshida, route, also, because, mount, fuji, is, designated, as, a, national, park, it, is, illegal, to, camp, above, the, fifth, station, there, are, eight, peaks, around, the, crater, at, the, summit, the, highest, point, in, japan, ken, ga, mine, is, where, the, mount, fuji, radar, system, used, to, be, it, was, replaced, by, an, automated, system, in, 2004, climbers, are, able, to, visit, each, of, these, peaks, paragliders, take, off, in, the, vicinity, of, the, fifth, station, gotemba, parking, lot, between, subashiri, and, h, ei, zan, peak, on, the, south, side, of, the, mountain, in, addition, to, several, other, locations, depending, on, wind, direction, several, paragliding, schools, use, the, wide, sandy, grassy, slope, between, gotemba, and, subashiri, parking, lots, as, a, training, hill, on, 1, february, 2024, the, yamanashi, prefectural, government, imposed, a, mandatory, fee, of, 2, 000, yen, 13, for, hikers, using, the, yoshida, trail, beginning, in, the, summer, season, as, part, of, efforts, to, ease, congestion, and, provide, funding, for, safety, protocols, it, later, announced, that, it, would, impose, a, daily, limit, of, 4, 000, hikers, on, the, trail, and, close, it, between, 4, p, m, and, 3, a, m, except, for, guests, in, mountain, lodges, the, shizuoka, prefectural, government, subsequently, announced, that, it, would, also, close, the, subashiri, gotemba, and, fujinomiya, trails, at, the, same, time, period, with, the, same, exceptions, citing, also, concerns, over, congestion, in, shinto, mythology, kuninotokotachi, kuninotokotachi, no, kami, in, kojiki, kuninotokotachi, no, mikoto, in, nihon, shoki, is, one, of, the, two, gods, born, from, something, like, a, reed, that, arose, from, the, soil, when, the, earth, was, chaotic, according, to, the, nihon, shoki, konohanasakuya, hime, wife, of, ninigi, is, the, goddess, of, mount, fuji, where, fujisan, hong, sengen, taisha, is, dedicated, for, her, in, ancient, times, the, mountain, was, worshipped, from, afar, the, asama, shrine, was, set, up, at, the, foothills, to, ward, off, eruptions, in, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, volcanic, activity, subsided, and, fuji, was, used, as, a, base, for, shugend, a, syncretic, religion, combining, mountain, worship, and, buddhism, worshippers, began, to, climb, the, slopes, and, by, the, early, 12th, century, matsudai, shonin, had, founded, a, temple, on, the, summit, fuji, k, was, an, edo, period, cult, centred, around, the, mountain, founded, by, an, ascetic, named, hasegawa, kakugy, 1541, 1646, the, cult, venerated, the, mountain, as, a, female, deity, and, encouraged, its, members, to, climb, it,
