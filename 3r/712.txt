in, the, new, indonesian, republic, and, took, steps, to, prepare, it, for, independence, as, a, separate, country, following, the, failure, of, the, dutch, and, indonesians, to, resolve, their, differences, over, west, new, guinea, during, the, dutch, indonesian, round, table, conference, in, late, 1949, it, was, decided, that, the, present, status, quo, of, the, territory, would, be, maintained, and, then, negotiated, bilaterally, one, year, after, the, date, of, the, transfer, of, sovereignty, however, both, sides, were, still, unable, to, resolve, their, differences, in, 1950,

of, a, national, flag, the, morning, star, flag, a, national, anthem, and, a, coat, of, arms, the, dutch, had, planned, to, transfer, independence, to, west, new, guinea, in, 1970, following, the,

araucaria, and, agathis, as, well, as, tree, ferns, and, several, species, of, eucalyptus, new, guinea, is, differentiated, from, its, drier, flatter, and, less, fertile, southern, counterpart, australia, by, its, much, higher, rainfall, and, its, active, volcanic, geology, yet, the, two, land, masses, share, a, similar, animal, fauna, with, marsupials, including, wallabies, and, possums, and, the, egg, laying, monotreme, the, echidna, other, than, bats, and, some, two, dozen, indigenous, rodent, genera, there, are, no, pre, human, indigenous, placental, mammals, pigs, several,

waterways, and, wetlands, of, papua, are, also, home, to, salt, and, freshwater, crocodile, tree, monitors, flying, foxes, osprey, bats, and, other, animals, while, the, equatorial, glacier, fields, remain, largely, unexplored, several, parts, of, the, province, remains, unexplored, due, to, steep, terrain, leaving, a, high, possibility, that, there, are, still, many, undiscovered, floras, and, faunas, that, is, yet, to, be, discovered, in, february, 2006, a, team, of, scientists, exploring, the, foja, mountains, sarmi, discovered, new, species, of, birds, butterflies, amphibians, and, plants, including, possibly, the, largest, flowered, species, of, rhododendron, in, december, 2007, a, second, scientific, expedition, was, taken, to, the, mountain, range, the, expedition, led, to, the, discovery, of, two, new, species, the, first, being, a, 1, 4, kg, giant, rat, mallomys, sp, approximately, five, times, the, size, of, a, regular, brown, rat, the, second, a, pygmy, possum, cercartetus, sp, described, by, scientists, as, one, of, the, world, s, smallest, marsupials, an, expedition, late, in, 2008, backed, by, the, indonesian, institute, of, sciences, national, geographic, society, and, smithsonian, institution, was, made, in, order, to, assess, the, area, s, biodiversity, new, types, of, animals, recorded, include, a, frog, with, a, long, erectile, nose, a, large, woolly, rat, an, imperial, pigeon, with, rust, grey, and, white, plumage, a, 25, cm, gecko, with, claws, rather, than, pads, on, its, toes, and, a, small, 30, cm, high, black, forest, wallaby, a, member, of, the, genus, dorcopsis, ecological, threats, include, logging, induced, deforestation, forest, conversion, for, plantation, agriculture, including, oil, palm, smallholder, agricultural, conversion, the, introduction, and, potential, spread, of, alien, species, such, as, the, crab, eating, macaque, which, preys, on, and, competes, with, indigenous, species, the, illegal, species, trade, and, water, pollution, from, oil, and, mining, operations, papua, gdp, share, by, sector, 2005, papua, is, reported, to, be, one, of, indonesia, s, poorest, regions, the, province, is, rich, in, natural, resources, but, has, weaknesses, namely, in, limited, infrastructure, and, less, skilled, human, resources, so, far, papua, has, had, a, fairly, good, economic, development, due, to, the, support, of, economic, sources, especially, mining, forest, agriculture, and, fisheries, products, economic, development, has, been, uneven, in, papua, and, poverty, in, the, region, remains, high, by, indonesian, standards, part, of, the, problem, has, been, neglect, of, the, poor, too, little, or, the, wrong, kind, of, government, support, from, jakarta, and, jayapura, a, major, factor, in, this, is, the, extraordinarily, high, cost, of, delivering, goods, and, services, to, large, numbers, of, isolated, communities, in, the, absence, of, a, developed, road, or, river, network, the, latter, in, contrast, to, kalimantan, providing, access, to, the, interior, and, the, highlands, intermittent, political, and, military, conflict, and, tight, security, controls, have, also, contributed, to, the, problem, but, with, the, exception, of, some, border, regions, and, a, few, pockets, in, the, highlands, this, has, not, been, the, main, factor, contributing, to, underdevelopment, papua, s, gross, domestic, product, grew, at, a, faster, rate, than, the, national, average, until, and, throughout, the, financial, crisis, of, 1997, 98, however, the, differences, are, much, smaller, if, mining, is, excluded, from, the, provincial, gdp, given, that, most, mining, revenues, were, commandeered, by, the, central, government, until, the, special, autonomy, law, was, passed, in, 2001, provincial, gdp, without, mining, is, most, likely, a, better, measure, of, papuan, gdp, during, the, pre, and, immediate, post, crisis, periods, on, a, per, capita, basis, the, gdp, growth, rates, for, both, papua, and, indonesia, are, lower, than, those, for, total, gdp, however, the, gap, between, per, capita, gdp, and, total, gdp, is, larger, for, papua, than, for, indonesia, as, a, whole, reflecting, papua, s, high, population, growth, rates, although, papua, has, experienced, almost, no, growth, in, gdp, the, situation, is, not, as, serious, as, one, might, think, it, is, true, that, the, mining, sector, dominated, by, freeport, indonesia, has, been, declining, over, the, last, decade, or, so, leading, to, a, fall, in, the, value, of, exports, on, the, other, hand, government, spending, and, fixed, capital, investment, have, both, grown, by, well, over, 10, per, cent, per, year, contributing, to, growth, in, sectors, such, as, finance, construction, transport, and, communications, and, trade, hotels, and, restaurants, with, so, many, sectors, still, experiencing, respectable, levels, of, growth, the, impact, of, the, stagnant, economy, on, the, welfare, of, the, population, will, probably, be, limited, it, should, also, be, remembered, that, mining, is, typically, an, enclave, activity, its, impact, on, the, general, public, is, fairly, limited, regardless, of, whether, it, is, booming, or, contracting, papua, has, depended, heavily, on, natural, resources, especially, the, mining, oil, and, gas, sectors, since, the, mid, 1970s, although, this, is, still, the, case, there, have, been, some, structural, changes, in, the, two, provincial, economies, since, the, split, in, 2003, the, contribution, of, mining, to, the, economy, of, papua, province, declined, from, 62, per, cent, in, 2003, to, 47, per, cent, in, 2012, the, shares, of, agriculture, and, manufacturing, also, fell, but, that, of, utilities, remained, the, same, a, few, other, sectors, notably, construction, and, services, increased, their, shares, during, the, period, despite, these, structural, changes, the, economy, of, papua, province, continues, to, be, dominated, by, the, mining, sector, and, in, particular, by, a, single, company, freeport, indonesia, mining, is, still, and, remains, one, of, the, dominant, economic, sector, in, papua, the, grasberg, mine, the, world, s, largest, gold, mine, and, second, largest, copper, mine, is, located, in, the, highlands, near, puncak, jaya, the, highest, mountain, in, papua, and, whole, indonesia, grasberg, mine, producing, 1, 063, billion, pounds, of, copper, 1, 061, million, ounces, gold, and, 2, 9, million, ounces, silver, it, has, 19, 500, employees, operated, by, pt, freeport, indonesia, pt, fi, which, used, to, be, 90, 64, owned, by, freeport, mcmoran, fcx, in, august, 2017, fcx, announced, that, it, will, divest, its, ownership, in, pt, fi, so, that, indonesia, owns, 51, in, return, the, cow, will, be, replaced, by, a, special, license, iupk, with, mining, rights, to, 2041, and, fcx, will, build, a, new, smelter, by, 2022, besides, mining, there, are, at, least, three, other, important, economic, sectors, excluding, the, government, sector, in, the, papuan, economy, the, first, is, agriculture, particularly, food, crops, forestry, and, fisheries, agriculture, made, up, 10, 4, per, cent, of, provincial, gdp, in, 2005, but, grew, at, an, average, rate, of, only, 0, 1, per, cent, per, annum, in, 2000, 05, the, second, important, sector, is, trade, hotels, and, restaurants, which, contributed, 4, 0, per, cent, of, provincial, gdp, in, 2005, within, this, sector, trade, contributed, most, to, provincial, gdp, however, the, subsector, with, the, highest, growth, rate, was, hotels, which, grew, at, 13, 2, per, cent, per, annum, in, 2000, 05, the, third, important, sector, is, transport, and, communications, which, contributed, 3, 4, per, cent, of, provincial, gdp, in, 2005, the, sector, grew, at, an, average, annual, rate, of, 5, 3, percent, in, 2000, 05, slightly, below, the, national, level, within, the, sector, sea, transport, air, transport, and, communications, performed, particularly, well, the, role, of, private, enterprise, in, developing, communications, and, air, transport, has, become, increasingly, significant, since, private, enterprise, will, only, expand, if, businesspeople, see, good, prospects, to, make, a, profit, this, is, certainly, an, encouraging, development, at, current, rates, of, growth, the, transport, and, communications, sector, could, support, the, development, of, agriculture, in, papua, however, so, far, most, of, the, growth, in, communications, has, been, between, the, rapidly, expanding, urban, areas, of, jayapura, timika, and, merauke, the, latter, two, now, in, the, new, provinces, of, central, papua, and, south, papua, respectively, and, between, them, and, the, rest, of, indonesia, nevertheless, in, the, medium, term, improved, communication, networks, may, create, opportunities, for, papua, to, shift, from, heavy, dependence, on, the, mining, sector, to, greater, reliance, on, the, agricultural, sector, with, good, international, demand, for, palm, oil, anticipated, in, the, medium, term, production, of, this, commodity, could, be, expanded, however, the, negative, effects, of, deforestation, on, the, local, environment, should, be, a, major, consideration, in, the, selection, of, new, areas, for, this, and, any, other, plantation, crop, in, 2011, papuan, caretaker, governor, syamsul, arief, rivai, claimed, papua, s, forests, cover, 42, million, hectares, with, an, estimated, worth, of, rp, 700, trillion, 78, billion, and, that, if, the, forests, were, managed, properly, and, sustainably, they, could, produce, over, 500, million, cubic, meters, of, logs, per, annum, manufacturing, and, banking, make, up, a, tiny, proportion, of, the, regional, economy, and, experienced, negative, growth, in, 2000, 05, poor, infrastructure, and, lack, of, human, capital, are, the, most, likely, reasons, for, the, poor, performance, of, manufacturing, in, addition, the, costs, of, manufacturing, are, typically, very, high, in, papua, as, they, are, in, many, other, outer, island, regions, of, indonesia, both, within, indonesia, and, in, the, world, economy, papua, s, comparative, advantage, will, continue, to, lie, in, agriculture, and, natural, resource, based, industries, for, a, long, time, to, come, a, more, significant, role, for, manufacturing, is, unlikely, given, the, far, lower, cost, of, labor, and, better, infrastructure, in, java, but, provided, that, there, are, substantial, improvements, in, infrastructure, and, communications, over, the, longer, term, manufacturing, can, be, expected, to, cluster, around, activities, related, to, agriculture, for, example, food, processing, compared, to, other, parts, of, indonesia, the, infrastructure, in, papua, is, one, of, the, most, least, developed, owing, to, its, distance, from, the, national, capital, jakarta, nevertheless, for, the, past, few, years, the, central, government, has, invested, significant, sums, of, money, to, build, and, improve, the, current, infrastructure, in, the, province, the, infrastructure, development, efforts, of, the, ministry, of, public, works, and, housing, in, papua, have, been, very, massive, in, the, last, 10, years, this, effort, is, carried, out, to, accelerate, equitable, development, and, support, regional, development, in, papua, the, main, focus, of, infrastructure, development, in, papua, is, to, improve, regional, connectivity, improve, the, quality, of, life, through, the, provision, of, basic, infrastructure, and, increase, food, security, through, the, development, of, water, resources, infrastructure, the, achievements, and, conditions, of, infrastructure, development, in, papua, until, 2017, have, shown, significant, progress, electricity, distribution, in, the, province, as, well, as, the, whole, country, is, operated, and, managed, by, the, perusahaan, listrik, negara, pln, originally, most, papuan, villages, do, not, have, access, to, electricity, the, indonesia, government, through, the, ministry, of, energy, and, mineral, resources, in, the, beginning, of, year, 2016, introduced, a, program, named, indonesia, terang, or, bright, indonesia, the, aimed, of, this, program, is, to, speed, up, electrification, rate, er, with, priority, to, the, six, provinces, at, eastern, area, of, indonesia, including, papua, province, the, target, of, indonesian, s, er, by, 2019, is, 97, while, the, indonesian, s, national, er, already, high, 88, 30, in, 2015, papua, still, the, lowest, er, 45, 93, among, the, provinces, the, scenario, to, boost, up, er, in, the, eastern, area, by, connected, the, consumers, at, villages, which, not, electrified, yet, to, the, new, renewable, energy, sources, the, percentage, of, household, that, were, connected, to, the, electricity, in, papua, electrification, ratio, er, is, the, lowest, one, among, the, provinces, in, indonesia, data, from, the, ministry, of, energy, and, mineral, resources, shows, that, only, papua, province, has, er, level, below, 50, 45, 93, with, the, national, average, re, was, 88, 30, high, er, of, more, than, 85, can, be, found, in, the, rest, of, west, area, of, the, country, the, main, reason, of, lowest, er, in, papua, is, a, huge, area, with, landlocked, and, mountain, situation, and, low, density, population, energy, consumption, in, residential, sector, 457, gwh, in, year, 2014, contributes, the, electrification, rate, in, papua, province, but, again, geographic, and, demographic, obstacle, made, the, electrical, energy, not, well, dispersed, in, papua, the, er, levels, are, usually, higher, in, the, coastal, area, but, become, low, in, the, mountain, area, these, can, be, seen, by, the, formation, of, new, provinces, in, 2022, papua, province, has, an, er, of, 89, 22, while, the, former, regions, of, south, papua, has, an, er, of, 73, 54, central, papua, has, an, er, of, 47, 36, and, highland, papua, has, an, er, of, 12, 09, all, pipes, water, supply, in, the, province, is, managed, by, the, papua, municipal, waterworks, indonesian, perusahaan, daerah, air, minum, papua, pdam, papua, the, supply, of, clean, water, is, one, of, the, main, problem, faced, by, the, province, especially, during, drought, seasons, papua, has, been, named, as, the, province, with, the, worst, sanitation, in, indonesia, garnering, a, score, of, 45, while, the, national, average, is, 75, due, to, unhealthy, lifestyle, habits, and, a, lack, of, clean, water, in, response, the, government, has, invested, money, to, build, the, sufficient, infrastructure, to, hold, clean, water, several, new, dams, are, also, being, built, by, the, government, throughout, the, province, achieving, universal, access, to, drinking, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, is, essential, to, accelerating, progress, in, the, fields, of, health, education, and, poverty, alleviation, in, 2015, about, a, quarter, of, the, population, used, basic, sanitation, facilities, at, home, while, a, third, still, practiced, open, defecation, the, coverage, of, improved, drinking, water, sources, is, much, higher, both, in, households, and, schools, inequality, based, on, income, and, residence, levels, is, stark, demonstrating, the, importance, of, integrating, equity, principles, into, policy, and, practice, and, expanding, the, coverage, of, community, based, total, sanitation, programs, papua, is, one, of, the, larger, province, in, indonesia, but, it, has, the, least, amount, of, telecommunications, services, due, to, geographic, isolation, the, deployment, of, service, to, the, district, and, to, the, sub, district, is, still, not, evenly, distributed, the, distribution, of, telecommunication, services, in, papua, is, still, very, uneven, this, is, indicated, by, the, percentage, of, the, number, of, telecommunication, services, and, infrastructure, whose, distribution, is, centralized, in, certain, areas, such, as, jayapura, based, on, data, the, human, development, index, in, papua, increases, every, year, but, is, not, accompanied, by, an, increase, adequate, number, of, telecommunication, facilities, the, ministry, of, communication, and, information, technology, through, the, information, technology, accessibility, agency, bakti, has, built, around, 9, base, transceiver, stations, in, remote, areas, of, papua, namely, puncak, jaya, regency, and, mamberamo, raya, regency, to, connect, to, internet, access, in, the, early, stages, the, internet, was, prioritized, to, support, the, continuity, of, education, health, and, better, public, services, to, realize, connectivity, in, accordance, with, government, priorities, the, ministry, of, communication, and, information, is, determined, to, reach, all, districts, in, the, papua, region, with, high, speed, internet, networks, by, 2020, it, is, planned, that, all, districts, in, papua, and, west, papua, will, build, a, fast, internet, backbone, network, there, are, 31, regencies, that, have, new, high, speed, internet, access, to, be, built, in, late, 2019, the, government, announced, the, completion, of, the, palapa, ring, project, a, priority, infrastructure, project, that, aimed, to, provide, access, to, 4g, internet, services, to, more, than, 500, regencies, across, indonesia, papua, included, the, project, is, estimated, to, have, cost, us, 1, 5, billion, and, comprises, 35, 000, km, 22, 000, mi, of, undersea, fiber, optic, cables, and, 21, 000, km, 13, 000, mi,

gbit, s, in, even, the, most, outlying, regions, of, the, country, so, far, air, routes, have, been, a, mainstay, in, papua, and, west, papua, provinces, as, a, means, of, transporting, people, and, goods, including, basic, necessities, due, to, inadequate, road, infrastructure, conditions, this, has, resulted, in, high, distribution, costs, which, have, also, increased, the, prices, of, various, staple, goods, especially, in, rural, areas, therefore, the, government, is, trying, to, reduce, distribution, costs, by, building, the, trans, papua, highway, as, of, 2016, the, trans, papua, highway, that, has, been, connected, has, reached, 3, 498, kilometers, with, asphalt, roads, for, 2, 075, kilometers, while, the, rest, are, still, dirt, roads, and, roads, that, have, not, been, connected, have, reached, 827, km, the, development, of, the, trans, papua, highway, will, create, connectivity, between, regions, so, that, it, can, have, an, impact, on, the, acceleration, of, economic, growth, in, papua, and, west, papua, in, the, long, term, apart, from, the, construction, of, the, trans, papua, highway, the, government, is, also, preparing, for, the, first, railway,

constituted, at, that, time, to, be, 3, 435, 430, people, the, actual, census, in, 2020, revealed, a, total, population, of, 4, 303, 707, spread, throughout, 28, regencies, and, one, administrative, city, following, the, division, of, the, province, into, 4, separate, provinces, the, city, of, jayapura, is, the, most, populated, administrative, division, in, the, province, with, a, total, of, 414, 860, people, in, mid, 2023, while, supiori, regency, which, comprises, mainly, the, island, of, supiori, one, of, the, schouten, islands, within, cenderawasih, bay, off, the, north, coast, of, papua, is, the, least, populated, administrative, division, in, the, province, with, just, 24, 010, people, most, of, the, population, in, the, province, are, concentrated, in, coastal, regions, especially, around, the, city, of, jayapura, and, its, suburbs, papua, is, also, home, to, many, migrants, from, other, parts, of, indonesia, of, which, an, overwhelming, percentage, of, these, migrants, came, as, part, of, a, government, sponsored, transmigration, program, the, transmigration, program, in, papua, was, only, formally, halted, by, president, joko, widodo, in, june, 2015, in, contrast, to, other, indonesian, provinces, which, are, mostly, dominated, by, austronesian, peoples, papua, and, west, papua, as, well, as, some, part, of, maluku, are, home, to, the, melanesians, the, indigenous, papuans, which, are, part, of, the, melanesians, forms, the, majority, of, the, population, in, the, province, many, believe, human, habitation, on, the, island, dates, to, as, early, as, 50, 000, bc, and, first, settlement, possibly, dating, back, to, 60, 000, years, ago, has, been, proposed, the, island, of, new, guinea, is, presently, populated, by, almost, a, thousand, different, tribal, groups, and, a, near, equivalent, number, of, separate, languages, which, makes, it, the, most, linguistically, diverse, area, in, the, world, current, evidence, indicates, that, the, papuans, who, constitute, the, majority, of, the, island, s, peoples, are, descended, from, the, earliest, human, inhabitants, of, new, guinea, these, original, inhabitants, first, arrived, in, new, guinea, at, a, time, either, side, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, approx, 21, 000, years, ago, when, the, island, was, connected, to, the, australian, continent, via, a, land, bridge, forming, the, landmass, of, sahul, these, peoples, had, made, the, shortened, sea, crossing, from, the, islands, of, wallacea, and, sundaland, the, present, malay, archipelago, by, at, least, 40, 000, years, ago, the, ancestral, austronesian, peoples, are, believed, to, have, arrived, considerably, later, approximately, 3, 500, years, ago, as, part, of, a, gradual, seafaring, migration, from, southeast, asia, possibly, originating, in, taiwan, austronesian, speaking, peoples, colonized, many, of, the, offshore, islands, to, the, north, and, east, of, new, guinea, such, as, new, ireland, and, new, britain, with, settlements, also, on, the, coastal, fringes, of, the, main, island, in, places, human, habitation, of, new, guinea, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, has, led, to, a, great, deal, of, diversity, which, was, further, increased, by, the, later, arrival, of, the, austronesians, and, the, more, recent, history, of, european, and, asian, settlement, papuan, is, also, home, to, ethnic, groups, from, other, part, of, indonesia, including, the, javanese, sundanese, balinese, batak, etc, most, of, these, migrants, came, as, part, of, the, transmigration, program, which, was, an, initiative, of, the, dutch, colonial, government, and, later, continued, by, the, indonesian, government, to, move, landless, people, from, densely, populated, areas, of, indonesia, to, less, populous, areas, of, the, country, the, program, was, accused, of, fuelling, marginalisation, and, discrimination, of, papuans, by, migrants, and, causing, fears, of, the, javanisation, or, islamisation, of, papua, there, is, open, conflict, between, migrants, the, state, and, indigenous, groups, due, to, differences, in, culture, particularly, in, administration, and, cultural, topics, such, as, nudity, food, and, sex, the, transmigration, program, in, papua, was, stopped, in, 2015, due, to, the, controversies, it, had, caused, papua, the, easternmost, region, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, exhibits, a, very, complex, linguistic, network, the, diversity, of, languages, and, the, situation, of, multilingualism, is, very, real, there, are, many, language, families, scattered, in, this, wide, area, namely, the, austronesian, language, family, and, numerous, non, austronesian, languages, known, collectively, as, papuan, languages, speakers, of, different, austronesian, languages, are, found, in, coastal, communities, such, as, biak, wandamen, waropen, and, ma, ya, on, the, other, hand, papuan, languages, are, spoken, in, the, interior, and, central, highlands, starting, from, the, bird, s, head, peninsula, in, the, west, to, the, eastern, tip, of, the, island, of, new, guinea, for, example, meybrat, dani, ekari, asmat, muyu, and, sentani, language, at, this, time, research, efforts, to, find, out, how, many, indigenous, languages, in, papua, are, still, being, pursued, important, efforts, regarding, documentation, and, inventory, of, languages, in, papua, have, also, been, carried, out, by, two, main, agencies, namely, sil, international, and, the, language, and, book, development, agency, in, jakarta, the, results, of, the, research, that, have, been, published, by, the, two, institutions, show, that, there, are, differences, in, the, number, of, regional, languages, in, papua, the, language, and, book, development, agency, as, the, official, indonesian, government, agency, has, announced, or, published, that, there, are, 207, different, regional, languages, in, papua, while, sil, international, has, stated, that, there, are, 271, regional, languages, in, the, region, some, of, the, regional, languages, of, papua, are, spoken, by, a, large, number, of, speakers, and, a, wide, spread, area, some, are, supported, by, a, small, number, of, speakers, and, are, scattered, in, a, limited, environment, however, until, now, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, still, a, number, of, regional, languages, in, papua, that, have, not, been, properly, studied, so, that, it, is, not, known, what, the, form, of, the, language, is, in, addition, to, local, languages, that, have, been, listed, by, the, two, main, institutions, above, there, are, also, dozens, more, languages, from, other, islands, due, to, population, migration, that, is, not, included, in, the, list, of, local, languages, in, papua, for, example, languages, from, sulawesi, bugis, makassar, toraja, minahasa, javanese, from, java, and, local, languages, from, maluku, so, called, papuan, languages, comprise, hundreds, of, different, languages, most, of, which, are, not, related, as, in, other, provinces, indonesian, is, the, official, language, of, the, state, as, well, as, the, province, indonesian, is, used, in, inter, ethnic, communication, usually, between, native, papuans, and, non, papuan, migrants, who, came, from, other, parts, of, indonesia, most, formal, education, and, nearly, all, national, mass, media, governance, administration, judiciary, and, other, forms, of, communication, in, papua, are, conducted, in, indonesian, a, malay, based, creole, language, called, papuan, malay, is, used, as, the, lingua, franca, in, the, province, it, emerged, as, a, contact, language, among, tribes, in, indonesian, new, guinea, for, trading, and, daily, communication, nowadays, it, has, a, growing, number, of, native, speakers, more, recently, the, vernacular, of, indonesian, papuans, has, been, influenced, by, standard, indonesian, the, national, standard, dialect, some, linguists, have, suggested, that, papuan, malay, has, its, roots, in, north, moluccan, malay, as, evidenced, by, the, number, of, ternate, loanwords, in, its, lexicon, others, have, proposed, that, it, is, derived, from, ambonese, malay, a, large, number, of, local, languages, are, spoken, in, the, province, and, the, need, for, a, common, lingua, franca, has, been, underlined, by, the, centuries, old, traditions, of, inter, group, interaction, in, the, form, of, slave, hunting, adoption, and, intermarriage, it, is, likely, that, malay, was, first, introduced, by, the, biak, people, who, had, contacts, with, the, sultanate, of, tidore, and, later, in, the, 19th, century, by, traders, from, china, and, south, sulawesi, however, malay, was, probably, not, widespread, until, the, adoption, of, the, language, by, the, dutch, missionaries, who, arrived, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, were, then, followed, in, this, practice, by, the, dutch, administrators, the, spread, of, malay, into, the, more, distant, areas, was, further, facilitated, by, the, opleiding, tot, dorpsonderwizer, education, for, village, teacher, program, during, the, dutch, colonial, era, there, are, four, varieties, of, papuan, malay, that, can, be, identified, including, serui, malay, a, variety, of, papuan, malay, is, spoken, in, vanimo, papua, new, guinea, near, the, indonesian, border, religion, in, papua, 2022, according, to, indonesian, citizenship, and, civil, registry, in, 2022, 70, 15, of, the, papuans, identified, themselves, as, christians, with, 64, 68, being, protestants, and, 5, 47, being, catholics, 29, 56, of, the, population, are, muslims, and, less, than, 1, were, buddhists, or, hindus, there, is, also, substantial, practice, of, animism, the, traditional, religion, for, many, papuans, with, many, blending, animistic, beliefs, with, other, religions, such, as, christianity, and, islam, christianity, including, protestantism, and, roman, catholic, are, mostly, adhered, by, native, papuans, and, migrants, from, maluku, east, nusa, tenggara, north, sulawesi, and, bataks, of, north, sumatra, islam, are, mostly, adhered, by, migrants, from, north, maluku, south, sulawesi, except, torajans, western, indonesia, and, some, native, papuans, lastly, hinduism, and, buddhism, are, mostly, adhered, by, balinese, migrants, and, chinese, indonesians, respectively, islam, had, been, present, in, papua, since, the, 15th, century, because, of, interaction, with, muslim, traders, and, moluccan, muslim, sultanates, especially, the, earliest, being, bacan, though, there, were,
