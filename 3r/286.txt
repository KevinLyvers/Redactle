lycophron, that, certain, shipwrecked, greek, boeotians, were, cast, nude, on, the, islands, was, evidently, invented, to, account, for, the, name, gymnesiae, ancient, greek, in, addition, diodorus, siculus, writes, that, the, greeks, called, the, islands, gymnesiae, because, the, inhabitants, were, naked, during, the, summer, time, also, a, tradition, holds, that, the, islands, were, colonized, by, rhodes, after, the, trojan, war, the, islands, had, a, very, mixed, population, several, stories, describing, them, as, having, unusual, habits, some, have, it, that, they, went, naked, year,

love, of, women, and, would, trade, three, or, four, men, to, ransom, one, woman, that, they, had, no, gold, or, silver, coin, and, forbade, the, importation, of, the, precious, metals, so, that, those, of, them, who, served, as, mercenaries, took, their, pay, in, wine, and, women, instead, of, money, the, roman, diodorus, siculus, described, their, marriage, and, funeral, customs, v, 18, book, 6, chapter, 5, noting, that, roman, observers, found, those, customs, peculiar, in, ancient, times, the, islanders, of, the, gymnesian, islands, illes, gimn, sies, constructed, talayots, and, were, famous, for, their, skill, with, the, sling, as, slingers, they, served, as, mercenaries, first, under, the, carthaginians, and, afterwards, under, the, romans, they, went, into, battle, ungirt, with, only, a, small, buckler, and, a, javelin, burnt, at, the, end, and, in, some, cases, tipped, with, a, small, iron, point, but, their, effective, weapons, were, their, slings, of, which, each, man, carried, three, wound, round, his, head, strabo, p, 168, eustath, or, as, seen, in, other, sources, one, round, the, head, one, round, the, body, and, one, in, the, hand, diodorus, the, three, slings, were, of, different, lengths, for, stones, of, different, sizes, the, largest, they, hurled, with, as, much, force, as, if, it, were, flung, from, a, catapult, and, they, seldom, missed, their, mark, to, this, exercise, they, were, trained, from, infancy, in, order, to, earn, their, livelihood, as, mercenary, soldiers, it, is, said, that, the, mothers, allowed, their, children, to, eat, bread, only, when, they, had, struck, it, off, a, post, with, the, sling, the, phoenicians, took, possession, of, the, islands, in, very, early, times, a, remarkable, trace, of, their, colonisation, is, preserved, in, the, town, of, mago, ma, in, menorca, after, the, fall, of, carthage, in, 146, bc, the, islands, seem, to, have, been, virtually, independent, notwithstanding, their, celebrity, in, war, the, people, were, generally, very, quiet, and, inoffensive, the, romans, however, easily, found, a, pretext, for, charging, them, with, complicity, with, the, mediterranean,
