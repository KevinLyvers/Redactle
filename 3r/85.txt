main, five, oceans, division, further, subdivision, the, southern, ocean, also, known, as, the, antarctic, ocean, comprises, the, southernmost, waters, of, the, world, ocean, generally, taken, to, be, south, of, 60, s, latitude, and, encircling, antarctica, with, a, size, of, 20, 327, 000, km, 2, 7, 848, 000, sq, mi, it, is, the, second, smallest, of, the, five, principal, oceanic, divisions, smaller, than, the, pacific, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, and, larger, than, the, arctic, ocean, the, maximum, depth, of, the, southern, ocean, using, the, definition, that, it, lies, south, of, 60th, parallel, was, surveyed, by, the, five, deeps, expedition, in, early, february, 2019, the, expedition, s, multibeam, sonar, team, identified, the, deepest, point, at, 60, 28, 46, s, 025, 32, 32, w, with, a, depth, of, 7, 434, metres, 24, 390, ft, the, expedition, leader, and, chief, submersible, pilot, victor, vescovo, has, proposed, naming, this, deepest, point, the, factorian, deep, based, on, the, name, of, the, crewed, submersible, dsv, limiting, factor, in, which, he, successfully, visited, the, bottom, for, the, first, time, on, february, 3, 2019, by, way, of, his, voyages, in, the, 1770s, james, cook, proved, that, waters, encompassed, the, southern, latitudes, of, the, globe, yet, geographers, have, often, disagreed, on, whether, the, southern, ocean, should, be, defined, as, a, body, of, water, bound, by, the, seasonally, fluctuating, antarctic, convergence, an, oceanic, zone, where, cold, northward, flowing, waters, from, the, antarctic, mix, with, warmer, subantarctic, waters, or, not, defined, at, all, with, its, waters, instead, treated, as, the, southern, limits, of, the, pacific, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, finally, settled, the, debate, after, the, full, importance, of, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, had, been, ascertained, and, the, term, southern, ocean, now, defines, the, body, of, water, which, lies, south, of, the, northern, limit, of, that, circulation, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, is, important, because, it, makes, up, the, second, half, of, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, after, the, better, known, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, much, like, amoc, it, has, also, been, substantially, affected, by, climate, change, in, ways, that, have, increased, ocean, stratification, and, which, may, also, result, in, the, circulation, substantially, slowing, or, even, passing, a, tipping, point, and, collapsing, outright, the, latter, would, have, adverse, impacts, on, global, weather, and, the, function, of, marine, ecosystems, here, unfolding, over, centuries, the, ongoing, warming, is, already, changing, marine, ecosystems, here, borders, and, names, for, oceans, and, seas, were, internationally, agreed, when, the, international, hydrographic, bureau, the, precursor, to, the, iho, convened, the, first, international, conference, on, 24, july, 1919, the, iho, then, published, these, in, its, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, the, first, edition, being, 1928, since, the, first, edition, the, limits, of, the, southern, ocean, have, moved, progressively, southward, since, 1953, it, has, been, omitted, from, the, official, publication, and, left, to, local, hydrographic, offices, to, determine, their, own, limits, the, iho, included, the, ocean, and, its, definition, as, the, waters, south, of, the, 60th, parallel, south, in, its, 2000, revisions, but, this, has, not, been, formally, adopted, due, to, continuing, impasses, about, some, of, the, content, such, as, the, naming, dispute, over, the, sea, of, japan, the, 2000, iho, definition, was, circulated, as, a, draft, edition, in, 2002, and, is, used, by, some, within, the, iho, and, other, organizations, such, as, the, cia, world, factbook, and, merriam, webster, the, australian, government, regards, the, southern, ocean, as, lying,

delineated, as, shown, in, the, figure, above, in, the, 1937, edition, it, therefore, encompassed, former, southern, ocean, waters, as, designated, in, 1928, but, was, technically, not, inside, any, of, the, three, adjacent, oceans, by, 1937, in, the, 2002, draft, edition, the, iho, have, designated, seas, as, subdivisions, within, oceans, so, the, bight, would, have, still, been, within, the, southern, ocean, in, 1937, if, the, 2002, convention, were, in, place, then, to, perform, direct, comparisons, of, current, and, former, limits, of, oceans, it, is, necessary, to, consider, or, at, least, be, aware, of, how, the, 2002, change, in, iho, terminology, for, seas, can, affect, the, comparison, the, southern, ocean, did, not, appear, in, the, 1953, third, edition, of, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, a, note, in, the, publication, read, the, antarctic, or, southern, ocean, has, been, omitted, from, this, publication, as, the, majority, of, opinions, received, since, the, issue, of, the, 2nd, edition, in, 1937, are, to, the, effect, that, there, exists, no, real, justification, for, applying, the, term, ocean, to, this, body, of, water, the, northern, limits, of, which, are, difficult, to, lay, down, owing, to, their, seasonal, change, the, limits, of, the, atlantic, pacific, and, indian, oceans, have, therefore, been, extended, south, to, the, antarctic, continent, hydrographic, offices, who, issue, separate, publications, dealing, with, this, area, are, therefore, left, to, decide, their, own, northern, limits, great, britain, uses, latitude, of, 55, south, 4, instead, in, the, iho, 1953, publication, the, atlantic, indian, and, pacific, oceans, were, extended, southward, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, which, had, not, previously, touched, pre, 1953, as, per, the, first, and, second, editions, now, abutted, at, the, meridian, of, south, east, cape, and, the, southern, limits, of, the, great, australian, bight, and, the, tasman, sea, were, moved, northward, the, iho, readdressed, the, question, of, the, southern, ocean, in, a, survey, in, 2000, of, its, 68, member, nations, 28, responded, and, all, responding, members, except, argentina, agreed, to, redefine, the, ocean, reflecting, the, importance, placed, by, oceanographers, on, ocean, currents, the, proposal, for, the, name, southern, ocean, won, 18, votes, beating, the, alternative, antarctic, ocean, half, of, the, votes, supported, a, definition, of, the, ocean, s, northern, limit, at, the, 60th, parallel, south, with, no, land, interruptions, at, this, latitude, with, the, other, 14, votes, cast, for, other, definitions, mostly, the, 50th, parallel, south, but, a, few, for, as, far, north, as, the, 35th, parallel, south, notably, the, southern, ocean, observing, system, collates, data, from, latitudes, higher, than, 40, degrees, south, a, draft, fourth, edition, of, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, was, circulated, to, iho, member, states, in, august, 2002, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, 2000, edition, as, it, summarized, the, progress, to, 2000, it, has, yet, to, be, published, due, to, areas, of, concern, by, several, countries, relating, to, various, naming, issues, around, the, world, primarily, the, sea, of, japan, naming, dispute, and, there, have, been, various, changes, 60, seas, were, given, new, names, and, even, the, name, of, the, publication, was, changed, a, reservation, had, also, been, lodged, by, australia, regarding, the, southern, ocean, limits, effectively, the, third, edition, which, did, not, delineate, the, southern, ocean, leaving, delineation, to, local, hydrographic, offices, has, yet, to, be, superseded, despite, this, the, fourth, edition, definition, has, partial, de, facto, usage, by, many, nations, scientists, and, organisations, such, as, the, u, s, the, cia, world, factbook, uses, southern, ocean, but, none, of, the, other, new, sea, names, within, the, southern, ocean, such, as, the, cosmonauts, sea, and, merriam, webster, scientists, and, nations, and, even, by, some, within, the, iho, some, nations, hydrographic, offices, have, defined, their, own, boundaries, the, united, kingdom, used, the, 55th, parallel, south, for, example, other, organisations, favour, more, northerly, limits, for, the, southern, ocean, for, example, encyclop, dia, britannica, describes, the, southern, ocean, as, extending, as, far, north, as, south, america, and, confers, great, significance, on, the, antarctic, convergence, yet, its, description, of, the, indian, ocean, contradicts, this, describing, the, indian, ocean, as, extending, south, to, antarctica, other, sources, such, as, the, national, geographic, society, show, the, atlantic, pacific, and, indian, oceans, as, extending, to, antarctica, on, its, maps, although, articles, on, the, national, geographic, web, site, have, begun, to, reference, the, southern, ocean, a, radical, shift, from, past, iho, practices, 1928, 1953, was, also, seen, in, the, 2002, draft, edition, when, the, iho, delineated, seas, as, subdivisions, within, the, boundaries, of, oceans, while, the, iho, are, often, considered, the, authority, for, such, conventions, the, shift, brought, them, into, line, with, the, practices, of, other, publications, e, g, the, cia, world, fact, book, which, already, adopted, the, principle, that, seas, are, contained, within, oceans, this, difference, in, practice, is, markedly, seen, for, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, adjacent, figure, thus, for, example, previously, the, tasman, sea, between, australia, and, new, zealand, was, not, regarded, by, the, iho, as, part, of, the, pacific, but, as, of, the, 2002, draft, edition, it, is, the, new, delineation, of, seas, as, subdivisions, of, oceans, has, avoided, the, need, to, interrupt, the, northern, boundary, of, the, southern, ocean, where, intersected, by, drake, passage, which, includes, all, of, the, waters, from, south, america, to, the, antarctic, coast, nor, interrupt, it, for, the, scotia, sea, which, also, extends, below, the, 60th, parallel, south, the, new, delineation, of, seas, has, also, meant, that, the, long, time, named, seas, around, antarctica, excluded, from, the, 1953, edition, the, 1953, map, did, not, even, extend, that, far, south, are, automatically, part, of, the, southern, ocean, in, australia, cartographical, authorities, define, the, southern, ocean, as, including, the, entire, body, of, water, between, antarctica, and, the, south, coasts, of, australia, and, new, zealand, and, up, to, 60, s, elsewhere, coastal, maps, of, tasmania, and, south, australia, label, the, sea, areas, as, southern, ocean, and, cape, leeuwin, in, western, australia, is, described, as, the, point, where, the, indian, and, southern, oceans, meet, exploration, of, the, southern, ocean, was, inspired, by, a, belief, in, the, existence, of, a, terra, australis, a, vast, continent, in, the, far, south, of, the, globe, to, balance, the, northern, lands, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, which, had, existed, since, the, times, of, ptolemy, the, rounding, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1487, by, bartolomeu, dias, first, brought, explorers, within, touch, of, the, antarctic, cold, and, proved, that, there, was, an, ocean, separating, africa, from, any, antarctic, land, that, might, exist, ferdinand, magellan, who, passed, through, the, strait, of, magellan, in, 1520, assumed, that, the, islands, of, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, south, were, an, extension, of, this, unknown, southern, land, in, 1564, abraham, ortelius, published, his, first, map, typus, orbis, terrarum, an, eight, leaved, wall, map, of, the, world, on, which, he, identified, the, regio, patalis, with, locach, as, a, northward, extension, of, the, terra, australis, reaching, as, far, as, new, guinea, european, geographers, continued, to, connect, the, coast, of, tierra, del, fuego, with, the, coast, of, new, guinea, on, their, globes, and, allowing, their, imaginations, to, run, riot, in, the, vast, unknown, spaces, of, the, south, atlantic, south, indian, and, pacific, oceans, they, sketched, the, outlines, of, the, terra, australis, incognita, unknown, southern, land, a, vast, continent, stretching, in, parts, into, the, tropics, the, search, for, this, great, south, land, was, a, leading, motive, of, explorers, in, the, 16th, and, the, early, part, of, the, 17th, centuries, the, spaniard, gabriel, de, castilla, who, claimed, having, sighted, snow, covered, mountains, beyond, the, 64, s, in, 1603, is, recognized, as, the, first, explorer, that, discovered, the, continent, of, antarctica, although, he, was, ignored, in, his, time, in, 1606, pedro, fern, ndez, de, quir, s, took, possession, for, the, king, of, spain, all, of, the, lands, he, had, discovered, in, australia, del, espiritu, santo, the, new, hebrides, and, those, he, would, discover, even, to, the, pole, francis, drake, like, spanish, explorers, before, him, had, speculated, that, there, might, be, an, open, channel, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, when, willem, schouten, and, jacob, le, maire, discovered, the, southern, extremity, of, tierra, del, fuego, and, named, it, cape, horn, in, 1615, they, proved, that, the, tierra, del, fuego, archipelago, was, of, small, extent, and, not, connected, to, the, southern, land, as, previously, thought, subsequently, in, 1642, abel, tasman, showed, that, even, new, holland, australia, was, separated, by, sea, from, any, continuous, southern, continent, the, visit, to, south, georgia, by, anthony, de, la, roch, in, 1675, was, the, first, ever, discovery, of, land, south, of, the, antarctic, convergence, i, e, in, the, southern, ocean, antarctic, soon, after, the, voyage, cartographers, started, to, depict, roch, island, honouring, the, discoverer, james, cook, was, aware, of, la, roch, s, discovery, when, surveying, and, mapping, the, island, in, 1775, edmond, halley, s, voyage, in, hms, paramour, for, magnetic, investigations, in, the, south, atlantic, met, the, pack, ice, in, 52, s, in, january, 1700, but, that, latitude, he, reached, 140, mi, off, the, north, coast, of, south, georgia, was, his, farthest, south, a, determined, effort, on, the, part, of, the, french, naval, officer, jean, baptiste, charles, bouvet, de, lozier, to, discover, the, south, land, described, by, a, half, legendary, sieur, de, gonneyville, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, bouvet, island, in, 54, 10, s, and, in, the, navigation, of, 48, of, longitude, of, ice, cumbered, sea, nearly, in, 55, s, in, 1730, in, 1771, yves, joseph, kerguelen, sailed, from, france, with, instructions, to, proceed, south, from, mauritius, in, search, of, a, very, large, continent, he, lighted, upon, a, land, in, 50, s, which, he, called, south, france, and, believed, to, be, the, central, mass, of, the, southern, continent, he, was, sent, out, again, to, complete, the, exploration, of, the, new, land, and, found, it, to, be, only, an, inhospitable, island, which, he, renamed, the, isle, of, desolation, but, which, was, ultimately, named, after, him, the, obsession, of, the, undiscovered, continent, culminated, in, the, brain, of, alexander, dalrymple, the, brilliant, and, erratic, hydrographer, who, was, nominated, by, the, royal, society, to, command, the, transit, of, venus, expedition, to, tahiti, in, 1769, the, command, of, the, expedition, was, given, by, the, admiralty, to, captain, james, cook, sailing, in, 1772, with, resolution, a, vessel, of, 462, tons, under, his, own, command, and, adventure, of, 336, tons, under, captain, tobias, furneaux, cook, first, searched, in, vain, for, bouvet, island, then, sailed, for, 20, degrees, of, longitude, to, the, westward, in, latitude, 58, s, and, then, 30, eastward, for, the, most, part, south, of, 60, s, a, lower, southern, latitude, than, had, ever, been, voluntarily, entered, before, by, any, vessel, on, 17, january, 1773, the, antarctic, circle, was, crossed, for, the, first, time, in, history, and, the, two, ships, reached, 67, 15, s, by, 39, 35, e, where, their, course, was, stopped, by, ice, cook, then, turned, northward, to, look, for, french, southern, and, antarctic, lands, of, the, discovery, of, which, he, had, received, news, at, cape, town, but, from, the, rough, determination, of, his, longitude, by, kerguelen, cook, reached, the, assigned, latitude, 10, too, far, east, and, did, not, see, it, he, turned, south, again, and, was, stopped, by, ice, in, 61, 52, s, by, 95, e, and, continued, eastward, nearly, on, the, parallel, of, 60, s, to, 147, e, on, 16, march, the, approaching, winter, drove, him, northward, for, rest, to, new, zealand, and, the, tropical, islands, of, the, pacific, in, november, 1773, cook, left, new, zealand, having, parted, company, with, the, adventure, and, reached, 60, s, by, 177, w, whence, he, sailed, eastward, keeping, as, far, south, as, the, floating, ice, allowed, the, antarctic, circle, was, crossed, on, 20, december, and, cook, remained, south, of, it, for, three, days, compelled, after, reaching, 67, 31, s, to, stand, north, again, in, 135, w, a, long, detour, to, 47, 50, s, served, to, show, that, there, was, no, land, connection, between, new, zealand, and, tierra, del, fuego, turning, south, again, cook, crossed, the, antarctic, circle, for, the, third, time, at, 109, 30, w, before, his, progress, was, once, again, blocked, by, ice, four, days, later, at, 71, 10, s, by, 106, 54, w, this, point, reached, on, 30, january, 1774, was, the, farthest, south, attained, in, the, 18th, century, with, a, great, detour, to, the, east, almost, to, the, coast, of, south, america, the, expedition, regained, tahiti, for, refreshment, in, november, 1774, cook, started, from, new, zealand, and, crossed, the, south, pacific, without, sighting, land, between, 53, and, 57, s, to, tierra, del, fuego, then, passing, cape, horn, on, 29, december, he, rediscovered, roch, island, renaming, it, isle, of, georgia, and, discovered, the, south, sandwich, islands, named, sandwich, land, by, him, the, only, ice, clad, land, he, had, seen, before, crossing, the, south, atlantic, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, between, 55, and, 60, he, thereby, laid, open, the, way, for, future, antarctic, exploration, by, exploding, the, myth, of, a, habitable, southern, continent, cook, s, most, southerly, discovery, of, land, lay, on, the, temperate, side, of, the, 60th, parallel, and, he, convinced, himself, that, if, land, lay, farther, south, it, was, practically, inaccessible, and, without, economic, value, voyagers, rounding, cape, horn, frequently, met, with, contrary, winds, and, were, driven, southward, into, snowy, skies, and, ice, encumbered, seas, but, so, far, as, can, be, ascertained, none, of, them, before, 1770, reached, the, antarctic, circle, or, knew, it, if, they, did, in, a, voyage, from, 1822, to, 1824, james, weddell, commanded, the, 160, ton, brig, jane, accompanied, by, his, second, ship, beaufoy, captained, by, matthew, brisbane, together, they, sailed, to, the, south, orkneys, where, sealing, proved, disappointing, they, turned, south, in, the, hope, of, finding, a, better, sealing, ground, the, season, was, unusually, mild, and, tranquil, and, on, 20, february, 1823, the, two, ships, reached, latitude, 74, 15, s, and, longitude, 34, 16, 45, w, the, southernmost, position, any, ship, had, ever, reached, up, to, that, time, a, few, icebergs, were, sighted, but, there, was, still, no, sight, of, land, leading, weddell, to, theorize, that, the, sea, continued, as, far, as, the, south, pole, another, two, days, sailing, would, have, brought, him, to, coat, s, land, to, the, east, of, the, weddell, sea, but, weddell, decided, to, turn, back, the, first, land, south, of, the, parallel, 60, south, latitude, was, discovered, by, the, englishman, william, smith, who, sighted, livingston, island, on, 19, february, 1819, a, few, months, later, smith, returned, to, explore, the, other, islands, of, the, south, shetlands, archipelago, landed, on, king, george, island,

is, actually, a, type, of, coastal, upwelling, since, there, are, no, continents, in, a, band, of, open, latitudes, between, south, america, and, the, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, some, of, this, water, is, drawn, up, from, great, depths, in, many, numerical, models, and, observational, syntheses, the, southern, ocean, upwelling, represents, the, primary, means, by, which, deep, dense,

some, decrease, of, the, salinity, of, the, waters, of, the, ross, gyre, since, the, 1950s, due, to, the, coriolis, effect, acting, to, the, left, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, the, resulting, ekman, transport, away, from, the, centres, of, the, weddell, gyre, these, regions, are, very, productive, due, to, upwelling, of, cold, nutrient, rich, water, observation, of, the, southern, ocean,

because, of, the, temperature, contrast, between, ice, and, open, ocean, the, ocean, from, about, latitude, 40, south, to, the, antarctic, circle, has, the, strongest, average, winds, found, anywhere, on, earth, in, winter, the, ocean, freezes, outward, to, 65, degrees, south, latitude, in, the, pacific, sector, and, 55, degrees, south, latitude, in, the, atlantic, sector, lowering, surface, temperatures, well, below, 0, degrees, celsius, at, some, coastal, points, persistent, intense, drainage, winds, from, the, interior, keep, the, shoreline, ice, free, throughout, the, winter, as, human, caused, greenhouse, gas, emissions, cause, increased, warming, one, of, the, most, notable, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, is, the, increase, in, ocean, heat, content, which, accounted, for, over, 90, of, the, total, global, heating, since, 1971, since, 2005, from, 67, to, 98, of, this, increase, has, occurred, in, the, southern, ocean, in, west, antarctica, the, temperature, in, the, upper, layer, of, the, ocean, has, warmed, 1, c, 1, 8, f, since, 1955, and, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, is, also, warming, faster, than, the, global, average, this, warming, directly, affects, the, flow, of, warm, and, cold, water, masses, which, make, up, the, overturning, circulation, and, it, also, has, negative, impacts, on, sea, ice, cover, in, southern, hemisphere, which, is, highly, reflective, and, so, elevates, the, albedo, of, earth, s, surface, as, well, as, mass, balance, of, antarctica, s, ice, shelves, and, peripheral, glaciers, for, these, reasons, climate, models, consistently, show, that, the, year, when, global, warming, will, reach, 2, c, 3, 6, f, inevitable, in, all, climate, change, scenarios, where, greenhouse, gas, emissions, have, not, been, strongly, lowered, depends, on, the, status, of, the, circulation, more, than, any, other, factor, besides, the, emissions, themselves, greater, warming, of, this, ocean, water, increases, ice, loss, from, antarctica, and, also, generates, more, fresh, meltwater, at, a, rate, of, 1100, 1500, billion, tons, gt, per, year, 1240, this, meltwater, from, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, then, mixes, back, into, the, southern, ocean, making, its, water, fresher, this, freshening, of, the, southern, ocean, results, in, increased, stratification, and, stabilization, of, its, layers, 1240, and, this, has, the, single, largest, impact, on, the, long, term, properties, of, southern, ocean, circulation, these, changes, in, the, southern, ocean, cause, the, upper, cell, circulation, to, speed, up, accelerating, the, flow, of, major, currents, while, the, lower, cell, circulation, slows, down, as, it, is, dependent, on, the, highly, saline, antarctic, bottom, water, which, already, appears, to, have, been, observably, weakened, by, the, freshening, in, spite, of, the, limited, recovery, during, 2010s, 1240, since, the, 1970s, the, upper, cell, has, strengthened, by, 3, 4, sverdrup, sv, represents, a, flow, of, 1, million, cubic, meters, per, second, or, 50, 60, of, its, flow, while, the, lower, cell, has, weakened, by, a, similar, amount, but, because, of, its, larger, volume, these, changes, represent, a, 10, 20, weakening, however, they, weren, t, fully, caused, by, climate, change, as, the, natural, cycle, of, interdecadal, pacific, oscillation, had, also, played, an, important, role, similar, processes, are, taking, place, with, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, which, is, also, affected, by, the, ocean, warming, and, by, meltwater, flows, from, the, declining, greenland, ice, sheet, it, is, possible, that, both, circulations, may, not, simply, continue, to, weaken, in, response, to, increased, warming, and, freshening, but, eventually, collapse, to, a, much, weaker, state, outright, in, a, way, which, would, be, difficult, to, reverse, and, constitute, an, example, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, there, is, paleoclimate, evidence, for, the, overturning, circulation, being, substantially, weaker, than, now, during, past, periods, that, were, both, warmer, and, colder, than, now, however, southern, hemisphere, is, only, inhabited, by, 10, of, the, world, s, population, and, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, has, historically, received, much, less, attention, than, the, amoc, consequently, while, multiple, studies, have, set, out, to, estimate, the, exact, level, of, global, warming, which, could, result, in, amoc, collapsing, the, timeframe, over, which, such, collapse, may, occur, and, the, regional, impacts, it, would, cause, much, less, equivalent, research, exists, for, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, as, of, the, early, 2020s, there, has, been, a, suggestion, that, its, collapse, may, occur, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 3, c, 5, 4, f, but, this, estimate, is, much, less, certain, than, for, many, other, tipping, points, a, variety, of, marine, animals, exist, and, rely, directly, or, indirectly, on, the, phytoplankton, in, the, southern, ocean, antarctic, sea, life, includes, penguins, blue, whales, orcas, colossal, squids, and, fur, seals, the, emperor, penguin, is, the, only, penguin, that, breeds, during, the, winter, in, antarctica, while, the, ad, lie, penguin, breeds, farther, south, than, any, other, penguin, the, rockhopper, penguin, has, distinctive, feathers, around, the, eyes, giving, the, appearance, of, elaborate, eyelashes, king, penguins, chinstrap, penguins, and, gentoo, penguins, also, breed, in, the, antarctic, the, antarctic, fur, seal, was, very, heavily, hunted, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, for, its, pelt, by, sealers, from, the, united, states, and, the, united,

flightless, penguins, are, all, located, in, the, southern, hemisphere, with, the, greatest, concentration, located, on, and, around, antarctica, four, of, the, 18, penguin, species, live, and, breed, on, the, mainland, and, its, close, offshore, islands, another, four, species, live, on, the, subantarctic, islands, emperor, penguins, have, four, overlapping, layers, of, feathers, keeping, them, warm, they, are, the, only, antarctic, animal, to, breed, during, the, winter, there, are, relatively, few, fish, species, in, few, families, in, the, southern, ocean, the, most, species, rich, family, are, the, snailfish, liparidae, followed, by, the, cod, icefish, nototheniidae, and, eelpout, zoarcidae, together, the, snailfish, eelpouts, and, notothenioids, which, includes, cod, icefish, and, several, other, families, account, for, almost, 9, 10, of, the, more, than, 320, described, fish, species, of, the, southern, ocean, tens, of, undescribed, species, also, occur, in, the, region, especially, among, the, snailfish, southern, ocean, snailfish, are, generally, found, in, deep, waters, while, the, icefish, also, occur, in, shallower, waters, cod, icefish, nototheniidae, as, well, as, several, other, families, are, part, of, the, notothenioidei, suborder, collectively, sometimes, referred, to, as, icefish, the, suborder, contains, many, species, with, antifreeze, proteins, in, their, blood, and, tissue, allowing, them, to, live, in, water, that, is, around, or, slightly, below, 0, c, 32, f, antifreeze, proteins, are, also, known, from, southern, ocean, snailfish, the, crocodile, icefish, family, channichthyidae, also, known, as, white, blooded, fish, are, only, found, in, the, southern, ocean, they, lack, hemoglobin, in, their, blood, resulting, in, their, blood, being, colourless, one, channichthyidae, species, the, mackerel, icefish, champsocephalus, gunnari, was, once, the, most, common, fish, in, coastal, waters, less, than, 400, metres, 1, 312, ft, deep, but, was, overfished, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, schools, of, icefish, spend, the, day, at, the, seafloor, and, the, night, higher, in, the, water, column, eating, plankton, and, smaller, fish, there, are, two, species, from, the, genus, dissostichus, the, antarctic, toothfish, dissostichus, mawsoni, and, the, patagonian, toothfish, dissostichus, eleginoides, these, two, species, live, on, the, seafloor, 100, 3, 000, metres, 328, 9, 843, ft, deep, and, can, grow, to, around, 2, metres, 7, ft, long, weighing, up, to, 100, kilograms, 220, lb, living, up, to, 45, years, the, antarctic, toothfish, lives, close, to, the, antarctic, mainland, whereas, the, patagonian, toothfish, lives, in, the, relatively, warmer, subantarctic, waters, toothfish, are, commercially, fished, and, overfishing, has, reduced, toothfish, populations, another, abundant, fish, group, is, the, genus, notothenia, which, like, the, antarctic, toothfish, have, antifreeze, in, their, bodies, an, unusual, species, of, icefish, is, the, antarctic, silverfish, pleuragramma, antarcticum, which, is, the, only, truly, pelagic, fish, in, the, waters, near, antarctica, seven, pinniped, species, inhabit, antarctica, the, largest, the, elephant, seal, mirounga, leonina, can, reach, up, to, 4, 000, kilograms, 8, 818, lb, while, females, of, the, smallest, the, antarctic, fur, seal, arctophoca, gazella, reach, only, 150, kilograms, 331, lb, these, two, species, live, north, of, the, sea, ice, and, breed, in, harems, on, beaches, the, other, four, species, can, live, on, the, sea, ice, crabeater, seals, lobodon, carcinophagus, and, weddell, seals, leptonychotes, weddellii, form, breeding, colonies, whereas, leopard, seals, hydrurga, leptonyx, and, ross, seals, ommatophoca, rossii, live, solitary, lives, although, these, species, hunt, underwater, they, breed, on, land, or, ice, and, spend, a, great, deal, of, time, there, as, they, have, no, terrestrial, predators, the, four, species, that, inhabit, sea, ice, are, thought, to, make, up, 50, of, the, total, biomass, of, the, world, s, seals, crabeater, seals, have, a, population, of, around, 15, million, making, them, one, of, the, most, numerous, large, animals, on, the, planet, the, new, zealand, sea, lion, phocarctos, hookeri, one, of, the, rarest, and, most, localised, pinnipeds, breeds, almost, exclusively, on, the, subantarctic, auckland, islands, although, historically, it, had, a, wider, range, out, of, all, permanent, mammalian, residents, the, weddell, seals, live, the, furthest, south, there, are, 10, cetacean, species, found, in, the, southern, ocean, six, baleen, whales, and, four, toothed, whales, the, largest, of, these, the, blue, whale, balaenoptera, musculus, grows, to, 24, metres, 79, ft, long, weighing, 84, tonnes, many, of, these, species, are, migratory, and, travel, to, tropical, waters, during, the, antarctic, winter, five, species, of, krill, small, free, swimming, crustaceans, have, been, found, in, the, southern, ocean, the, antarctic, krill, euphausia, superba, is, one, of, the, most, abundant, animal, species, on, earth, with, a, biomass, of, around, 500, million, tonnes, each, individual, is, 6, centimetres, 2, 4, in, long, and, weighs, over, 1, gram, 0, 035, oz, the, swarms, that, form, can, stretch, for, kilometres, with, up, to, 30, 000, individuals, per, 1, cubic, metre, 35, cu, ft, turning, the, water, red, swarms, usually, remain, in, deep, water, during, the, day, ascending, during, the, night, to, feed, on, plankton, many, larger, animals, depend, on, krill, for, their, own, survival, during, the, winter, when, food, is, scarce, adult, antarctic, krill, can, revert, to, a, smaller, juvenile, stage, using, their, own, body, as, nutrition, many, benthic, crustaceans, have, a, non, seasonal, breeding, cycle, and, some, raise, their, young, in, a, brood, pouch, glyptonotus, antarcticus, is, an, unusually, large, benthic, isopod, reaching, 20, centimetres, 8, in, in, length, weighing, 70, grams, 2, 47, oz, amphipods, are, abundant, in, soft, sediments, eating, a, range, of, items, from, algae, to, other, animals, the, amphipods, are, highly, diverse, with, more, than, 600, recognized, species, found, south, of, the, antarctic, convergence, and, there, are, indications, that, many, undescribed, species, remain, among, these, are, several, giants, such, as, the, iconic, epimeriids, that, are, up, to, 8, cm, 3, 1, in, long, slow, moving, sea, spiders, are, common, sometimes, growing, as, large, as, a, human, hand, they, feed, on, the, corals, sponges, and, bryozoans, that, litter, the, seabed, many, aquatic, molluscs, are, present, in, antarctica, bivalves, such, as, adamussium, colbecki, move, around, on, the, seafloor, while, others, such, as, laternula, elliptica, live, in, burrows, filtering, the, water, above, there, are, around, 70, cephalopod, species, in, the, southern, ocean, the, largest, of, which, is, the, colossal, squid, mesonychoteuthis, hamiltoni, which, at, up, to, 14, metres, 46, ft, is, among, the, largest, invertebrate, in, the, world, squid, makes, up, most, of, the, diet, of, some, animals, such, as, grey, headed, albatrosses, and, sperm, whales, and, the, warty, squid, moroteuthis, ingens, is, one, of, the, subantarctic, s, most, preyed, upon, species, by, vertebrates, the, sea, urchin, genus, abatus, burrow, through, the, sediment, eating, the, nutrients, they, find, in, it, two, species, of, salps, are, common, in, antarctic, waters, salpa, thompsoni, and, ihlea, racovitzai, salpa, thompsoni, is, found, in, ice, free, areas, whereas, ihlea, racovitzai, is, found, in, the, high, latitude, areas, near, ice, due, to, their, low, nutritional, value, they, are, normally, only, eaten, by, fish, with, larger, animals, such, as, birds, and, marine, mammals, only, eating, them, when, other, food, is, scarce, antarctic, sponges, are, long, lived, and, sensitive, to, environmental, changes, due, to, the, specificity, of, the, symbiotic, microbial, communities, within, them, as, a, result, they, function, as, indicators, of, environmental, health, increased, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, resulting, from, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, has, reduced, marine, primary, productivity, phytoplankton, by, as, much, as, 15, and, has, started, damaging, the, dna, of, some, fish, illegal, unreported, and, unregulated, fishing, especially, the, landing, of, an, estimated, five, to, six, times, more, patagonian, toothfish, than, the, regulated, fishery, likely, affects, the, sustainability, of, the, stock, long, line, fishing, for, toothfish, causes, a, high, incidence, of, seabird, mortality, all, international, agreements, regarding, the, world, s, oceans, apply, to, the, southern, ocean, it, is, also, subject, to, several, regional, agreements, the, southern, ocean, whale, sanctuary, of, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, prohibits, commercial, whaling, south, of, 40, degrees, south, south, of, 60, degrees, south, between, 50, degrees, and, 130, degrees, west, japan, regularly, does, not, recognize, this, provision, because, the, sanctuary, violates, iwc, charter, since, the, scope, of, the, sanctuary, is, limited, to, commercial, whaling, in, regard, to, its, whaling, permit, and, whaling, for, scientific, research, a, japanese, fleet, carried, out, an, annual, whale, hunt, in, the, region, on, 31, march, 2014, the, international, court, of, justice, ruled, that, japan, s, whaling, program, which, japan, has, long, claimed, is, for, scientific, purposes, was, a, cloak, for, commercial, whaling, and, no, further, permits, would, be, granted, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, seals, is, part, of, the, antarctic, treaty, system, it, was, signed, at, the, conclusion, of, a, multilateral, conference, in, london, on, 11, february, 1972, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, is, part, of, the, antarctic, treaty, system, it, entered, into, force, on, 7, april, 1982, with, a, goal, to, preserve, marine, life, and, environmental, integrity, in, and, near, antarctica, it, was, established, largely, due, to, concerns, that, an, increase, in, krill, catches, in, the, southern, ocean, could, seriously, impact, populations, of, other, marine, life, which, are, dependent, upon, krill, for, food, many, nations, prohibit, the, exploration, for, and, the, exploitation, of, mineral, resources, south, of, the, fluctuating, antarctic, convergence, which, lies, in, the, middle, of, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, and, serves, as, the, dividing, line, between, the, very, cold, polar, surface, waters, to, the, south, and, the, warmer, waters, to, the, north, the, antarctic, treaty, covers, the, portion, of, the, globe, south, of, 60, degrees, south, it, prohibits, new, claims, to, antarctica, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, applies, to, the, area, south, of, 60, south, latitude, as, well, as, the, areas, further, north, up, to, the, limit, of, the, antarctic, convergence, between, 1, july, 1998, and, 30, june, 1999, fisheries, landed, 119, 898, tonnes, 118, 004, long, tons, 132, 165, short, tons, of, which, 85, consisted, of, krill, and, 14, of, patagonian, toothfish, international, agreements, came, into, force, in, late, 1999, to, reduce, illegal, unreported, and, unregulated, fishing, which, in, the, 1998, 99, season, landed, five, to, six, times, more, patagonian, toothfish, than, the, regulated, fishery, major, operational, ports, include, rothera, station, palmer, station, villa, las, estrellas, esperanza, base, mawson, station, mcmurdo, station, and, offshore, anchorages, in, antarctica, few, ports, or, harbors, exist, on, the, southern, antarctic, coast, of, the, southern, ocean, since, ice, conditions, limit, use, of, most, shores, to, short, periods, in, midsummer, even, then, some, require, icebreaker, escort, for, access, most, antarctic, ports, are, operated, by, government, research, stations, and, except, in, an, emergency, remain, closed, to, commercial, or, private, vessels, vessels, in, any, port, south, of, 60, degrees, south, are, subject, to, inspection, by, antarctic, treaty, observers, the, southern, ocean, s,

the, original, 1928, iho, delineation, of, the, southern, ocean, and, the, 1937, delineation, if, the, great, australian, bight, is, considered, integral, australian, ports, and, harbors, between, cape, leeuwin, and, cape, otway, on, the, australian, mainland, and, along, the, west, coast, of, tasmania, would, also, be, identified, as, ports, and, harbors, existing, in, the, southern, ocean, these, would, include, the, larger, ports, and, harbors, of, albany, thevenard, port, lincoln, whyalla, port, augusta, port, adelaide, portland, warrnambool, and, macquarie, harbour, even, though, organizers, of, several, yacht, races, define, their, routes, as, involving, the, southern, ocean, the, actual, routes, don, t, enter, the, actual, geographical, boundaries, of, the, southern, ocean,
