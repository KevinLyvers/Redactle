the, suez, canal, arabic, qan, t, as, suwais, is, an, artificial, sea, level, waterway, in, egypt, connecting, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, red, sea, through, the, isthmus, of, suez, and, dividing, africa, and, asia, and, by, extension, the, sinai, peninsula, from, the, rest, of, egypt, the, 193, 30, kilometre, long, 120, 11, mi, canal, is, a, key, trade, route, between, europe, and, asia, in, 1858, french, diplomat, ferdinand, de, lesseps, formed, the, compagnie, de, suez, for, the, express, purpose, of, building, the, canal, construction, of, the, canal, lasted, from, 1859, to, 1869, the, canal, officially, opened, on, 17, november, 1869, it, offers, vessels, a, direct, route, between, the, north, atlantic, and, northern, indian, oceans, via, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, red, sea, avoiding, the, south, atlantic, and, southern, indian, oceans, and, reducing, the, journey, distance, from, the, arabian, sea, to, london, by, approximately, 8, 900, kilometres, 5, 500, mi, to, 10, days, at, 20, knots, 37, km, h, 23, mph, or, 8, days, at, 24, knots, 44, km, h, 28, mph, the, canal, extends, from, the, northern, terminus, of, port, said, to, the, southern, terminus, of, port, tewfik, at, the, city, of, suez, in, 2021, more, than, 20, 600, vessels, traversed, the, canal, an, average, of, 56, per, day, the, original, canal, featured, a, single, lane, waterway, with, passing, locations, in, the, ballah, bypass, and, the, great, bitter, lake, it, contained, according, to, alois, negrelli, s, plans, no, locks, with, seawater, flowing, freely, through, it, in, general, the, water, in, the, canal, north, of, the, bitter, lakes, flows, north, in, winter, and, south, in, summer, south, of, the, lakes, the, current, changes, with, the, tide, at, suez, the, canal, was, the, property, of, the, egyptian, government, but, european, shareholders, mostly, british, and, french, owned, the, concessionary, company, which, operated, it, until, july, 1956, when, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, nationalised, it, an, event, which, led, to, the, suez, crisis, of, october, november, 1956, the, canal, is, operated, and, maintained, by, the, state, owned, suez, canal, authority, sca, of, egypt, under, the, convention, of, constantinople, it, may, be, used, in, time, of, war, as, in, time, of, peace, by, every, vessel, of, commerce, or, of, war, without, distinction, of, flag, nevertheless, the, canal, has, played, an, important, military, strategic, role, as, a, naval, short, cut, and, choke, point, navies, with, coastlines, and, bases, on, both, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, red, sea, egypt, and, israel, have, a, particular, interest, in, the, suez, canal, after, egypt, closed, the, suez, canal, at, the, beginning, of, the, six, day, war, on, 5, june, 1967, the, canal, remained, closed, for, eight, years, reopening, on, 5, june, 1975, the, egyptian, government, launched, construction, in, 2014, to, expand, and, widen, the, ballah, bypass, for, 35, km, 22, mi, to, speed, up, the, canal, s, transit, time, the, expansion, intended, to, nearly, double, the, capacity, of, the, suez, canal, from, 49, to, 97, ships, per, day, at, a, cost, of, le, 59, 4, billion, us, 9, billion, this, project, was, funded, with, interest, bearing, investment, certificates, issued, exclusively, to, egyptian, entities, and, individuals, the, suez, canal, authority, officially, opened, the, new, side, channel, in, 2016, this, side, channel, at, the, northern, side, of, the, east, extension, of, the, suez, canal, serves, the, east, terminal, for, berthing, and, unberthing, vessels, from, the, terminal, as, the, east, container, terminal, is, located, on, the, canal, itself, before, the, construction, of, the, new, side, channel, it, was, not, possible, to, berth, or, unberth, vessels, at, the, terminal, while, a, convoy, was, running, ancient, west, east, canals, were, built, to, facilitate, travel, from, the, nile, to, the, red, sea, one, smaller, canal, is, believed, to, have, been, constructed, under, the, auspices, of, senusret, ii, or, ramesses, ii, another, canal, probably, incorporating, a, portion, of, the, first, was, constructed, under, the, reign, of, necho, ii, 610, 595, bce, but, the, only, fully, functional, canal, was, engineered, and, completed, by, darius, i, 522, 486, bce, james, henry, breasted, attributes, the, earliest, known, attempt, to, construct, a, canal, to, the, first, cataract, near, aswan, to, the, sixth, dynasty, of, egypt, and, its, completion, to, senusret, iii, 1878, 1839, bce, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, of, egypt, the, legendary, sesostris, likely, either, pharaoh, senusret, ii, or, senusret, iii, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, of, egypt, may, have, constructed, the, ancient, canal, the, canal, of, the, pharaohs, joining, the, nile, with, the, red, sea, 1897, 1839, bce, when, an, irrigation, channel, was, constructed, around, 1848, bce, that, was, navigable, during, the, flood, season, leading, into, a, dry, river, valley, east, of, the, nile, river, delta, named, wadi, tumilat, it, is, said, that, in, ancient, times, the, red, sea, reached, northward, to, the, bitter, lakes, and, lake, timsah, in, his, meteorology, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, wrote, one, of, their, kings, tried, to, make, a, canal, to, it, for, it, would, have, been, of, no, little, advantage, to, them, for, the, whole, region, to, have, become, navigable, sesostris, is, said, to, have, been, the, first, of, the, ancient, kings, to, try, but, he, found, that, the, sea, was, higher, than, the, land, so, he, first, and, darius, afterwards, stopped, making, the, canal, lest, the, sea, should, mix, with, the, river, water, and, spoil, it, strabo, wrote, that, sesostris, started, to, build, a, canal, and, pliny, the, elder, 23, 24, 79, ce, wrote, 165, next, comes, the, tyro, tribe, and, the, harbour, of, the, daneoi, from, which, sesostris, king, of, egypt, intended, to, carry, a, ship, canal, to, where, the, nile, flows, into, what, is, known, as, the, delta, this, is, a, distance, of, over, 60, miles, 100, km, later, the, persian, king, darius, had, the, same, idea, and, yet, again, ptolemy, ii, who, made, a, trench, 100, feet, 30, m, wide, 30, feet, 9, m, deep, and, about, 35, miles, 55, km, long, as, far, as, the, bitter, lakes, in, the, 20th, century, the, northward, extension, of, the, later, darius, i, canal, was, discovered, extending, from, lake, timsah, to, the, ballah, lakes, this, was, dated, to, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, by, extrapolating, the, dates, of, ancient, sites, along, its, course, the, reliefs, of, the, punt, expedition, under, hatshepsut, 1470, bce, depict, seagoing, vessels, carrying, the, expeditionary, force, returning, from, punt, this, suggests, that, a, navigable, link, existed, between, the, red, sea, and, the, nile, recent, excavations, in, wadi, gawasis, may, indicate, that, egypt, s, maritime, trade, started, from, the, red, sea, and, did, not, require, a, canal, evidence, seems, to, indicate, its, existence, by, the, 13th, century, bce, during, the, time, of, ramesses, ii, remnants, of, an, ancient, west, east, canal, through, the, ancient, egyptian, cities, of, bubastis, pi, ramesses, and, pithom, were, discovered, by, napoleon, bonaparte, and, his, engineers, and, cartographers, in, 1799, according, to, the, histories, of, the, greek, historian, herodotus, about, 600, bce, necho, ii, undertook, to, dig, a, west, east, canal, through, the, wadi, tumilat, between, bubastis, and, heroopolis, and, perhaps, continued, it, to, the, heroopolite, gulf, and, the, red, sea, regardless, necho, is, reported, as, having, never, completed, his, project, herodotus, was, told, that, 120, 000, men, perished, in, this, undertaking, but, this, figure, is, doubtless, exaggerated, according, to, pliny, the, elder, necho, s, extension, to, the, canal, was, about, 92, kilometres, 57, statute, miles, equal, to, the, total, distance, between, bubastis, and, the, great, bitter, lake, allowing, for, winding, through, valleys, the, length, that, herodotus, tells, of, over, 1, 000, stadia, i, e, over, 183, kilometres, or, 114, miles, must, be, understood, to, include, the, entire, distance, between, the, nile, and, the, red, sea, at, that, time, with, necho, s, death, work, was, discontinued, herodotus, tells, that, the, reason, the, project, was, abandoned, was, because, of, a, warning, received, from, an, oracle, that, others, would, benefit, from, its, successful, completion, necho, s, war, with, nebuchadnezzar, ii, most, probably, prevented, the, canal, s, continuation, necho, s, project, was, completed, by, darius, i, of, persia, who, ruled, over, ancient, egypt, after, it, had, been, conquered, by, his, predecessor, cambyses, ii, it, may, be, that, by, darius, s, time, a, natural, waterway, passage, which, had, existed, between, the, heroopolite, gulf, and, the, red, sea, in, the, vicinity, of, the, egyptian, town, of, shaluf, alt, chalouf, or, shaloof, located, just, south, of, the, great, bitter, lake, had, become, so, blocked, with, silt, that, darius, needed, to, clear, it, out, so, as, to, allow, navigation, once, again, according, to, herodotus, darius, s, canal, was, wide, enough, that, two, triremes, could, pass, each, other, with, oars, extended, and, required, four, days, to, traverse, darius, commemorated, his, achievement, with, a, number, of, granite, stelae, that, he, set, up, on, the, nile, bank, including, one, near, kabret, and, a, further, one, a, few, kilometres, north, of, suez, darius, the, great, s, suez, inscriptions, read, king, darius, says, i, am, a, persian, setting, out, from, persia, i, conquered, egypt, i, ordered, to, dig, this, canal, from, the, river, that, is, called, nile, and, flows, in, egypt, to, the, sea, that, begins, in, persia, therefore, when, this, canal, had, been, dug, as, i, had, ordered, ships, went, from, egypt, through, this, canal, to, persia, as, i, had, intended, the, canal, left, the, nile, at, bubastis, an, inscription, on, a, pillar, at, pithom, records, that, in, 270, or, 269, bce, it, was, again, reopened, by, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, in, arsinoe, ptolemy, constructed, a, navigable, lock, with, sluices, at, the, heroopolite, gulf, of, the, red, sea, which, allowed, the, passage, of, vessels, but, prevented, salt, water, from, the, red, sea, from, mingling, with, the, fresh, water, in, the, canal, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, french, cartographers, discovered, the, remnants, of, an, ancient, north, south, canal, past, the, east, side, of, lake, timsah, and, ending, near, the, north, end, of, the, great, bitter, lake, this, proved, to, be, the, canal, made, by, darius, i, as, his, stele, commemorating, its, construction, was, found, at, the, site, this, ancient, second, canal, may, have, followed, a, course, along, the, shoreline, of, the, red, sea, when, it, once, extended, north, to, lake, timsah, the, red, sea, is, believed, by, some, historians, to, have, gradually, receded, over, the, centuries, its, coastline, slowly, moving, southward, away, from, lake, timsah, and, the, great, bitter, lake, coupled, with, persistent, accumulations, of, nile, silt, maintenance, and, repair, of, ptolemy, s, canal, became, increasingly, cumbersome, over, each, passing, century, two, hundred, years, after, the, construction, of, ptolemy, s, canal, cleopatra, seems, to, have, had, no, west, east, waterway, passage, because, the, pelusiac, branch, of, the, nile, which, fed, ptolemy, s, west, east, canal, had, by, that, time, dwindled, being, choked, with, silt, in, support, of, this, contention, one, can, note, that, in, 31, bce, during, a, reversal, of, fortune, in, mark, antony, s, and, cleopatra, s, war, against, octavian, she, attempted, to, escape, egypt, with, her, fleet, by, raising, the, ships, out, of, the, mediterranean, and, dragging, them, across, the, isthmus, of, suez, to, the, red, sea, then, according, to, plutarch, the, arabs, of, petra, attacked, and, burned, the, first, wave, of, these, ships, and, cleopatra, abandoned, the, effort, modern, historians, however, maintain, that, her, ships, were, burned, by, the, enemy, forces, of, malichus, i, the, ancient, canal, was, re, excavated, by, roman, emperor, trajan, in, the, first, century, ad, who, named, it, amnis, traianus, after, himself, he, reportedly, moved, its, mouth, on, the, nile, further, south, at, the, site, of, what, is, now, old, cairo, by, the, time, of, the, arab, conquest, in, 641, ad, this, canal, had, fallen, out, of, use, the, commander, of, the, muslim, force, amr, ibn, al, as, ordered, that, it, be, restored, so, as, to, improve, connections, between, egypt, and, medina, the, muslim, capital, at, the, time, the, muslim, canal, was, excavated, further, north, from, trajan, s, canal, joining, the, nile, close, to, what, is, now, the, sayyida, zaynab, neighbourhood, of, cairo, this, canal, reportedly, ended, near, modern, suez, the, site, of, the, former, roman, channel, near, the, nile, was, absorbed, into, the, new, city, of, fustat, a, geography, treatise, de, mensura, orbis, terrae, written, by, the, irish, monk, dicuil, born, late, 8th, century, reports, a, conversation, with, another, monk, fidelis, who, had, sailed, on, the, canal, from, the, nile, to, the, red, sea, during, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, in, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, is, said, to, have, ordered, this, canal, closed, in, 767, to, prevent, supplies, from, reaching, arabian, detractors, the, remaining, section, of, the, canal, near, the, nile, known, as, the, khalij, continued, to, serve, as, part, of, cairo, s, water, infrastructure, until, the, 19th, century, in, later, periods, the, canal, was, closed, with, a, dike, for, much, of, the, year, and, reopened, during, the, flood, season, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, is, claimed, to, have, repaired, the, cairo, to, red, sea, passageway, but, only, briefly, circa, 1000, ce, as, it, soon, became, choked, with, sand, the, successful, 1488, navigation, of, southern, africa, by, bartolomeu, dias, opened, a, direct, maritime, trading, route, to, india, and, the, spice, islands, and, forever, changed, the, balance, of, mediterranean, trade, one, of, the, most, prominent, losers, in, the, new, order, as, former, middlemen, was, the, former, spice, trading, center, of, venice, venetian, leaders, driven, to, desperation, contemplated, digging, a, waterway, between, the, red, sea, and, the, nile, anticipating, the, suez, canal, by, almost, 400, years, to, bring, the, luxury, trade, flooding, to, their, doors, again, but, this, remained, a, dream, despite, entering, negotiations, with, egypt, s, ruling, mamelukes, the, venetian, plan, to, build, the, canal, was, quickly, put, to, rest, by, the, ottoman, conquest, of, egypt, in, 1517, led, by, sultan, selim, i, during, the, 16th, century, the, ottoman, grand, vizier, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, attempted, to, construct, a, canal, connecting, the, red, sea, and, the, mediterranean, this, was, motivated, by, a, desire, to, connect, constantinople, to, the, pilgrimage, and, trade, routes, of, the, indian, ocean, as, well, as, by, strategic, concerns, as, the, european, presence, in, the, indian, ocean, was, growing, ottoman, mercantile, and, strategic, interests, were, increasingly, challenged, and, the, sublime, porte, was, increasingly, pressed, to, assert, its, position, a, navigable, canal, would, allow, the, ottoman, navy, to, connect, its, red, sea, black, sea, and, mediterranean, fleets, however, this, project, was, deemed, too, expensive, and, was, never, completed, during, the, french, campaign, in, egypt, and, syria, in, late, 1798, napoleon, expressed, interest, in, finding, the, remnants, of, an, ancient, waterway, passage, this, culminated, in, a, cadre, of, archaeologists, scientists, cartographers, and, engineers, scouring, northern, egypt, their, findings, recorded, in, the, description, de, l, gypte, include, detailed, maps, that, depict, the, discovery, of, an, ancient, canal, extending, northward, from, the, red, sea, and, then, westward, toward, the, nile, later, napoleon, who, became, the, french, emperor, in, 1804, contemplated, the, construction, of, a, north, south, canal, to, connect, the, mediterranean, with, the, red, sea, but, the, plan, was, abandoned, because, it, incorrectly, concluded, that, the, waterway, would, require, locks, to, operate, the, construction, of, which, would, be, costly, and, time, consuming, the, belief, in, the, need, for, locks, was, based, on, the, erroneous, belief, that, the, red, sea, was, 8, 5, m, 28, ft, higher, than, the, mediterranean, this, was, the, result, of, using, fragmentary, survey, measurements, taken, in, wartime, during, napoleon, s, egyptian, expedition, as, late, as, 1861, the, unnavigable, ancient, route, discovered, by, napoleon, from, bubastis, to, the, red, sea, still, channelled, water, as, far, east, as, kassassin, despite, the, construction, challenges, that, could, have, been, the, result, of, the, alleged, difference, in, sea, levels, the, idea, of, finding, a, shorter, route, to, the, east, remained, alive, in, 1830, general, francis, chesney, submitted, a, report, to, the, british, government, that, stated, that, there, was, no, difference, in, elevation, and, that, the, suez, canal, was, feasible, but, his, report, received, no, further, attention, lieutenant, waghorn, established, his, overland, route, which, transported, post, and, passengers, to, india, via, egypt, linant, de, bellefonds, a, french, explorer, of, egypt, became, chief, engineer, of, egypt, s, public, works, in, addition, to, his, normal, duties, he, surveyed, the, isthmus, of, suez, and, made, plans, for, the, suez, canal, french, saint, simonianists, showed, an, interest, in, the, canal, and, in, 1833, barth, lemy, prosper, enfantin, tried, to, draw, muhammad, ali, s, attention, to, the, canal, but, was, unsuccessful, alois, negrelli, the, italian, austrian, railroad, pioneer, became, interested, in, the, idea, in, 1836, in, 1846, prosper, enfantin, s, soci, t, d, tudes, du, canal, de, suez, invited, a, number, of, experts, among, them, robert, stephenson, negrelli, and, paul, adrien, bourdaloue, to, study, the, feasibility, of, the, suez, canal, with, the, assistance, of, linant, de, bellefonds, bourdaloue, s, survey, of, the, isthmus, was, the, first, generally, accepted, evidence, that, there, was, no, practical, difference, in, elevation, between, the, two, seas, britain, however, feared, that, a, canal, open, to, everyone, might, interfere, with, its, india, trade, and, therefore, preferred, a, connection, by, train, from, alexandria, via, cairo, to, suez, which, stephenson, eventually, built, in, 1854, and, 1856, ferdinand, de, lesseps, obtained, a, concession, from, sa, id, pasha, the, khedive, of, egypt, and, sudan, to, create, a, company, to, construct, a, canal, open, to, ships, of, all, nations, the, company, was, to, operate, the, canal, for, 99, years, from, its, opening, de, lesseps, had, used, his, friendly, relationship, with, sa, id, which, he, had, developed, while, he, was, a, french, diplomat, in, the, 1830s, as, stipulated, in, the, concessions, de, lesseps, convened, the, international, commission, for, the, piercing, of, the, isthmus, of, suez, commission, internationale, pour, le, percement, de, l, isthme, de, suez, consisting, of, 13, experts, from, seven, countries, among, them, john, robinson, mcclean, later, president, of, the, institution, of, civil, engineers, in, london, and, again, negrelli, to, examine, the, plans, developed, by, linant, de, bellefonds, and, to, advise, on, the, feasibility, of, and, the, best, route, for, the, canal, after, surveys, and, analyses, in, egypt, and, discussions, in, paris, on, various, aspects, of, the, canal, where, many, of, negrelli, s, ideas, prevailed, the, commission, produced, a, unanimous, report, in, december, 1856, containing, a, detailed, description, of, the, canal, complete, with, plans, and, profiles, the, suez, canal, company, compagnie, universelle, du, canal, maritime, de, suez, came, into, being, on, 15, december, 1858, the, british, government, had, opposed, the, project, from, the, outset, to, its, completion, the, british, who, controlled, both, the, cape, route, and, the, overland, route, to, india, and, the, far, east, favored, the, status, quo, given, that, a, canal, might, disrupt, their, commercial, and, maritime, supremacy, lord, palmerston, the, project, s, most, unwavering, foe, confessed, in, the, mid, 1850s, the, real, motive, behind, his, opposition, that, britain, s, commercial, and, maritime, relations, would, be, overthrown, by, the, opening, of, a, new, route, open, to, all, nations, and, thus, deprive, his, country, of, its, present, exclusive, advantages, as, one, of, the, diplomatic, moves, against, the, project, when, it, nevertheless, went, ahead, it, disapproved, of, the, use, of, forced, labour, for, construction, of, the, canal, involuntary, labour, on, the, project, ceased, and, the, viceroy, condemned, the, corv, e, halting, the, project, international, opinion, was, initially, skeptical, and, shares, of, the, suez, canal, company, did, not, sell, well, overseas, britain, austria, and, russia, did, not, buy, a, significant, number, of, shares, with, assistance, from, the, cattaui, banking, family, and, their, relationship, with, james, de, rothschild, of, the, french, house, of, rothschild, bonds, and, shares, were, successfully, promoted, in, france, and, other, parts, of, europe, all, french, shares, were, quickly, sold, in, france, a, contemporary, british, skeptic, claimed, one, thing, is, sure, our, local, merchant, community, doesn, t, pay, practical, attention, at, all, to, this, grand, work, and, it, is, legitimate, to, doubt, that, the, canal, s, receipts, could, ever, be, sufficient, to, recover, its, maintenance, fee, it, will, never, become, a, large, ship, s, accessible, way, in, any, case, work, started, on, the, shore, of, the, future, port, said, on, 25, april, 1859, the, excavation, took, some, 10, years, with, forced, labour, corv, e, being, employed, until, 1864, to, dig, out, the, canal, some, sources, estimate, that, over, 30, 000, people, were, working, on, the, canal, at, any, given, period, that, more, than, 1, 5, million, people, from, various, countries, were, employed, and, that, tens, of, thousands, of, labourers, died, many, of, them, from, cholera, and, similar, epidemics, estimates, of, the, number, of, deaths, vary, widely, with, gamal, abdel, nasser, citing, 120, 000, deaths, upon, nationalisation, of, the, canal, in, a, 26, july, 1956, speech, and, the, company, s, chief, medical, officer, reporting, no, higher, than, 2, 49, deaths, per, thousand, in, 1866, doubling, these, estimates, with, a, generous, assumption, of, 50, 000, working, staff, per, year, over, 11, years, would, put, a, conservative, estimate, at, fewer, than, 3, 000, deaths, more, closely, relying, on, the, limited, reported, data, of, the, time, the, number, would, be, fewer, than, 1, 000, from, its, inauguration, till, 1925, the, suez, canal, company, built, a, series, of, company, towns, along, the, canal, to, serve, its, operation, they, included, ports, and, their, facilities, as, well, as, housing, for, employees, segregated, by, race, or, nationality, these, were,

american, natural, historian, h, w, harkness, in, the, afternoon, there, were, blessings, of, the, canal, with, both, muslim, and, christian, ceremonies, a, temporary, mosque, and, church, having, been, built, side, by, side, on, the, beach, in, the, evening, there, were, more, illuminations, and, fireworks, on, the, morning, of, 17, november, a, procession, of, ships, entered, the, canal, headed, by, the, l, aigle, among, the, ships, following, was, hms, newport, captained, by, george, nares, which, surveyed, the, canal, on, behalf, of, the, admiralty, a, few, months, later, the, newport, was, involved, in, an, incident, that, demonstrated, some, of, the, problems, with, the, canal, there, were, suggestions, that, the, depth, of, parts, of, the, canal, at, the, time, of, the, inauguration, were, not, as, great, as, promised, and, that, the, deepest, part, of, the, channel, was, not, always, clear, leading, to, a, risk, of, grounding, the, first, day, of, the, passage, ended, at, lake, timsah, 76, kilometres, 41, nmi, south, of, port, said, the, french, ship, p, luse, anchored, close, to, the, entrance, then, swung, around, and, grounded, the, ship, and, its, hawser, blocking, the, way, into, the, lake, the, following, ships, had, to, anchor, in, the, canal, itself, until, the, p, luse, was, hauled, clear, the, next, morning, making, it, difficult, for, them, to, join, that, night, s, celebration, in, ismailia, except, for, the, newport, nares, sent, out, a, boat, to, carry, out, soundings, and, was, able, to, manoeuver, around, the, p, luse, to, enter, the, lake, and, anchor, there, for, the, night, ismailia, was, the, scene, of, more, celebrations, the, following, day, including, a, military, march, past, illuminations, and, fireworks, and, a, ball, at, the, governor, s, palace, the, convoy, set, off, again, on, the, morning, of, 19, november, for, the, remainder, of, the, trip, to, suez, after, suez, many, of, the, participants, headed, for, cairo, and, then, to, the, pyramids, where, a, new, road, had, been, built, for, the, occasion, an, anchor, line, ship, the, s, s, dido, became, the, first, to, pass, through, the, canal, from, south, to, north, although, numerous, technical, political, and, financial, problems, had, been, overcome, the, final, cost, was, more, than, double, the, original, estimate, the, khedive, in, particular, was, able, to, overcome, initial, reservations, held, by, both, british, and, french, creditors, by, enlisting, the, help, of, the, sursock, family, whose, deep, connections, proved, invaluable, in, securing, much, international, support, for, the, project, after, the, opening, the, suez, canal, company, was, in, financial, difficulties, the, remaining, works, were, completed, only, in, 1871, and, traffic, was, below, expectations, in, the, first, two, years, de, lesseps, therefore, tried, to, increase, revenues, by, interpreting, the, kind, of, net, ton, referred, to, in, the, second, concession, tonneau, de, capacit, as, meaning, a, ship, s, cargo, capacity, and, not, only, the, theoretical, net, tonnage, of, the, moorsom, system, introduced, in, britain, by, the, merchant, shipping, act, in, 1854, the, ensuing, commercial, and, diplomatic, activities, resulted, in, the, international, commission, of, constantinople, establishing, a, specific, kind, of, net, tonnage, and, settling, the, question, of, tariffs, in, its, protocol, of, 18, december, 1873, this, was, the, origin, of, the, suez, canal, net, tonnage, and, the, suez, canal, special, tonnage, certificate, both, of, which, are, still, in, use, today, the, canal, had, an, immediate, and, dramatic, effect, on, world, trade, combined, with, the, american, transcontinental, railroad, completed, six, months, earlier, it, allowed, the, world, to, be, circled, in, record, time, it, played, an, important, role, in, increasing, european, colonization, of, africa, the, construction, of, the, canal, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, panic, of, 1873, in, great, britain, because, goods, from, the, far, east, had, until, then, been, carried, in, sailing, vessels, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, stored, in, british, warehouses, an, inability, to, pay, his, bank, debts, led, said, pasha, s, successor, isma, il, pasha, in, 1875, to, sell, his, 44, share, in, the, canal, for, 4, 000, 000, 19, 2, million, equivalent, to, 432, million, to, 456, million, 540, million, to, 570, million, in, 2019, to, the, government, of, the, united, kingdom, french, shareholders, still, held, the, majority, local, unrest, caused, the, british, to, invade, in, 1882, and, take, full, control, although, nominally, egypt, remained, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, british, representative, from, 1883, to, 1907, was, evelyn, baring, 1st, earl, of, cromer, who, reorganized, and, modernized, the, government, and, suppressed, rebellions, and, corruption, thereby, facilitating, increased, traffic, on, the, canal, the, european, mediterranean, countries, in, particular, benefited, economically, from, the, suez, canal, as, they, now, had, much, faster, connections, to, asia, and, east, africa, than, the, north, and, west, european, maritime, trading, nations, such, as, great, britain, the, netherlands, or, germany, the, biggest, beneficiary, in, the, mediterranean, was, austria, hungary, which, had, participated, in, the, planning, and, construction, of, the, canal, the, largest, austrian, maritime, trading, company, sterreichischer, lloyd, experienced, rapid, expansion, after, the, canal, was, completed, as, did, the, port, city, of, trieste, then, an, austrian, possession, the, company, was, a, partner, in, the, compagnie, universelle, du, canal, de, suez, whose, vice, president, was, the, lloyd, co, founder, pasquale, revoltella, in, 1900, a, dredging, trial, was, held, by, the, suez, canal, company, to, determine, which, ship, would, assist, in, the, widening, and, deepening, of, the, canal, one, of, the, ships, trialed, in, the, dredging, was, the, hercules, a, ship, owned, by, the, queensland, government, in, australia, the, hercules, dredged, deposits, of, granite, and, limestone, but, it, was, determined, at, the, end, of, the, trial, that, the, hercules, would, not, be, used, for, the, dredging, of, the, suez, canal, the, ship, was, then, returned, to, brisbane, australia, in, january, 1901, the, convention, of, constantinople, in, 1888, declared, the, canal, a, neutral, zone, under, the, protection, of, the, british, who, had, occupied, egypt, and, sudan, at, the, request, of, khedive, tewfiq, to, suppress, the, urabi, revolt, against, his, rule, the, revolt, went, on, from, 1879, to, 1882, the, british, defended, the, strategically, important, passage, against, a, major, ottoman, attack, in, 1915, during, the, first, world, war, under, the, anglo, egyptian, treaty, of, 1936, the, uk, retained, control, over, the, canal, with, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, the, canal, was, again, strategically, important, italo, german, attempts, to, capture, it, were, repulsed, during, the, north, africa, campaign, which, ensured, the, canal, remained, closed, to, axis, shipping, in, 1951, egypt, repudiated, the, 1936, treaty, with, great, britain, in, october, 1954, the, uk, tentatively, agreed, to, remove, its, troops, from, the, canal, zone, because, of, egyptian, overtures, towards, the, soviet, union, both, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, withdrew, their, pledge, to, financially, support, construction, of, the, aswan, dam, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, responded, by, nationalising, the, canal, on, 26, july, 1956, and, transferring, it, to, the, suez, canal, authority, intending, to, finance, the, dam, project, using, revenue, from, the, canal, on, the, same, day, that, the, canal, was, nationalised, nasser, also, closed, the, straits, of, tiran, to, all, israeli, ships, this, led, to, the, suez, crisis, in, which, the, uk, france, and, israel, invaded, egypt, according, to, the, pre, agreed, war, plans, under, the, protocol, of, s, vres, israel, invaded, the, sinai, peninsula, on, 29, october, forcing, egypt, to, engage, them, militarily, and, allowing, the, anglo, french, partnership, to, declare, the, resultant, fighting, a, threat, to, stability, in, the, middle, east, and, enter, the, war, officially, to, separate, the, two, forces, but, in, reality, to, regain, the, canal, and, bring, down, the, nasser, government, to, save, the, british, from, what, he, thought, was, a, disastrous, action, and, to, stop, the, war, from, a, possible, escalation, canadian, secretary, of, state, for, external, affairs, lester, b, pearson, proposed, the, creation, of, the, first, united, nations, peacekeeping, force, to, ensure, access, to, the, canal, for, all, and, an, israeli, withdrawal, from, the, sinai, peninsula, on, 4, november, 1956, a, majority, at, the, united, nations, voted, for, pearson, s, peacekeeping, resolution, which, mandated, the, un, peacekeepers, to, stay, in, sinai, unless, both, egypt, and, israel, agreed, to, their, withdrawal, the, united, states, backed, this, proposal, by, putting, pressure, on, the, british, government, through, the, selling, of, sterling, which, would, cause, it, to, depreciate, britain, then, called, a, ceasefire, and, later, agreed, to, withdraw, its, troops, by, the, end, of, the, year, pearson, was, later, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, as, a, result, of, damage, and, ships, sunk, under, orders, from, nasser, the, canal, was, closed, until, april, 1957, when, it, was, cleared, with, un, assistance, a, un, force, unef, was, established, to, maintain, the, free, navigability, of, the, canal, and, peace, in, the, sinai, peninsula, after, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, egypt, closed, the, canal, to, israeli, shipping, despite, un, security, council, resolutions, from, 1949, and, 1951, urging, it, not, to, on, the, grounds, that, hostilities, had, ended, with, the, 1949, armistice, agreement, egypt, closed, the, canal, again, during, the, 1956, suez, crisis, on, 16, may, 1967, nasser, ordered, unef, peacekeeping, forces, out, of, the, sinai, peninsula, including, the, suez, canal, area, egyptian, troops, were, sent, into, sinai, to, take, their, place, israel, protested, nasser, s, on, 21, may, order, to, close, the, straits, of, tiran, to, israeli, trade, after, the, 1967, six, day, war, israeli, forces, occupied, the, sinai, peninsula, including, the, entire, east, bank, of, the, suez, canal, in, the, following, years, the, tensions, between, egypt, and, israel, intensified, and, from, march, 1969, until, august, 1970, a, war, of, attrition, took, place, as, the, then, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, tried, to, retake, the, territories, occupied, by, israel, during, the, conflict, the, fighting, ceased, after, the, death, of, nasser, on, 28, september, 1970, after, this, conflict, there, were, no, changes, in, the, distribution, of, territory, but, the, underlying, tensions, persisted, unwilling, to, allow, the, israelis, to, use, the, canal, egypt, imposed, a, blockade, which, closed, the, canal, to, all, shipping, immediately, after, the, beginning, of, the, six, day, war, the, canal, remained, blocked, for, eight, years, there, was, no, anticipation, of, this, event, and, consequently, fifteen, cargo, ships, known, as, the, yellow, fleet, were, trapped, in, the, canal, and, remained, there, until, its, reopening, in, 1975, on, 6, october, 1973, during, the, yom, kippur, war, the, canal, was, the, scene, of, operation, badr, in, which, the, egyptian, army, crossed, into, israeli, occupied, sinai, much, wreckage, from, this, conflict, remains, visible, along, the, canal, s, edges, on, 22, october, 1973, israeli, forces, counter, attacked, by, crossing, the, suez, canal, into, egypt, and, advancing, towards, suez, city, where, they, remained, until, after, israel, and, egypt, signed, on, 18, january, 1974, an, agreement, commonly, known, as, sinai, i, with, the, official, name, of, sinai, separation, of, forces, agreement, which, included, a, withdrawal, of, israeli, forces, from, the, western, side, of, the, suez, canal, after, the, yom, kippur, war, the, united,

between, israel, and, egypt, as, called, for, under, the, egypt, israel, peace, treaty, of, 1979, the, mandate, could, not, be, extended, because, of, the, veto, by, the, soviet, union, in, the, un,

after, taking, office, as, president, of, egypt, abdel, fattah, el, sisi, ordered, the, expansion, of, the, ballah, bypass, from, 61, metres, 200, ft, wide, to, 312, metres, 1, 024, ft, wide, for, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, the, project, was, called, the, new, suez, canal, as, it, allows, ships, to, transit, the, canal, in, both, directions, simultaneously, the, project, cost, more, than, le, 59, 4, billion, us, 9, billion, and, was, completed, within, a, year, sisi, declared, the, expanded, channel, open, to, business, in, a, ceremony, on, 6, august, 2015, in, 2004, the, canal, was, closed, for, three, days, when, the, oil, tanker, tropic, brilliance, became, stuck, on, 18, october, 2017, the, oocl, japan, ran, aground, causing, an, obstruction, which, blocked, the, canal, for, a, few, hours, on, 23, march, 2021, at, around, 05, 40, utc, 07, 40, local, time, the, suez, canal, was, blocked, in, both, directions, by, ultra, large, evergreen, g, class, container, ship, ever, given, the, ship, operated, by, evergreen, marine, was, en, route, from, malaysia, to, the, netherlands, when, it, ran, aground, after, strong, winds, allegedly, blew, the, ship, off, course, upon, running, aground, ever, given, turned, sideways, completely, blocking, the, canal, although, part, of, the, length, of, the, canal, is, paralleled, by, an, older, narrower, channel, which, can, be, used, to, bypass, obstructions, this, incident, occurred, to, the, south, in, a, section, of, the, canal, where, there, is, only, one, channel, when, the, incident, began, many, economists, and, trade, experts, commented, on, the, effects, of, the, obstruction, if, not, resolved, quickly, citing, how, important, the, suez, was, to, global, trade, the, incident, was, likely, to, drastically, affect, the, global, economy, because, of, the, trapped, goods, scheduled, to, go, through, the, canal, among, those, goods, oil, shipments, were, the, most, affected, in, the, immediate, aftermath, due, to, a, significant, number, still, blocked, with, no, other, way, to, reach, their, destination, referring, to, the, european, and, american, market, a, few, maritime, experts, have, disputed, the, prediction, of, a, drastic, effect, on, trade, saying, this, really, isn, t, a, substantial, transit, route, for, crude, according, to, marshall, steeves, energy, markets, analyst, at, ihs, markit, and, there, are, existing, stocks, according, to, camille, egloff, of, boston, consulting, group, and, alternative, sources, of, supply, noting, that, traffic, only, slowed, down, and, that, it, might, only, have, impacted, sectors, with, existing, shortages, such, as, the, semiconductor, industry, the, international, chamber, of, shipping, ics, estimated, that, up, to, 3, billion, worth, of, cargo, passes, through, the, suez, canal, every, day, it, was, said, the, blockage, would, have, an, impact, on, cargo, schedules, around, the, world, shipping, companies, were, also, considering, whether, to, divert, their, ships, along, the, much, longer, route, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, first, container, ship, diverted, was, ever, given, s, sister, ship, ever, greet, ever, given, was, re, floated, on, 29, march, within, a, few, hours, cargo, traffic, resumed, slowly, resolving, the, backlog, of, around, 450, ships, the, first, ship, to, pass, through, the, canal, after, ever, given, s, recovery, was, ym, wish, a, hong, kong, based, cargo, ship, on, 2, april, 2021, usama, rabie, chairman, of, the, suez, canal, authority, of, egypt, said, that, the, damage, caused, by, the, blockage, of, the, canal, could, reach, about, 1, billion, rabie, also, revealed, that, after, the, suez, canal, resumed, navigation, as, of, noon, on, 31, march, 285, cargo, ships, had, passed, through, the, canal, smoothly, he, said, that, the, remaining, 175, freighters, waiting, to, pass, through, the, canal, would, all, pass, by, 2, april, after, the, incident, the, egyptian, government, announced, that, they, would, be, widening, the, narrower, parts, of, the, canal, on, 9, september, 2021, the, canal, was, briefly, blocked, again, by, mv, coral, crystal, however, this, ship, was, freed, within, 15, minutes, presenting, minimal, disruption, to, other, convoys, on, 25, may, 2023, a, hong, kong, flagged, cargo, ship, mv, xin, hai, tong, 23, was, grounded, near, the, southern, end, of, the, canal, but, it, was, refloated, by, tugboats, in, less, than, a, day, when, built, the, canal, was, 164, km, 102, mi, long, and, 8, m, 26, ft, deep, after, several, enlargements, it, is, 193, 30, km, 120, 1, 8, mi, long, 24, m, 79, ft, deep, and, 205, m, 673, ft, wide, it, consists, of, the, northern, access, channel, of, 22, km, 14, mi, the, canal, itself, of, 162, 25, km, 100, 7, 8, mi, and, the, southern, access, channel, of, 9, km, 5, 1, 2, mi, the, so, called, new, suez, canal, functional, since, 6, august, 2015, currently, has, a, new, parallel, canal, in, the, middle, part, with, its, length, over, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, the, current, parameters, of, the, suez, canal, including, both, individual, canals, of, the, parallel, section, are, depth, 23, to, 24, m, 75, to, 79, ft, and, width, at, least, 205, to, 225, m, 673, to, 738, ft, that, width, measured, at, 11, m, 36, ft, of, depth, the, canal, allows, passage, of, ships, up, to, 20, m, 66, ft, draft, or, 240, 000, deadweight, tons, and, up, to, a, height, of, 68, m, 223, ft, above, water, level, and, a, maximum, beam, of, 77, 5, m, 254, ft, under, certain, conditions, the, canal, can, handle, more, traffic, and, larger, ships, than, the, panama, canal, as, suezmax, dimensions, are, greater, than, both, panamax, and, new, panamax, some, supertankers, are, too, large, to, traverse, the, canal, others, can, offload, part, of, their, cargo, onto, a, canal, owned, ship, to, reduce, their, draft, transit, and, reload, at, the, other, end, of, the, canal, on, 15, april, 2021, egyptian, authorities, announced, that, they, would, widen, the, southern, section, of, the, suez, canal, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, the, canal, the, plan, mainly, covers, about, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, from, suez, to, the, great, bitter, lake, it, will, be, widened, by, 40, metres, 130, ft, and, the, maximum, depth, will, be, increased, from, about, 20, metres, 66, ft, to, about, 22, metres, 72, ft, ships, approaching, the, canal, from, the, sea, are, expected, to, radio, the, harbour, when, they, are, within, 15, nautical, miles, 28, kilometres, of, the, fairway, buoy, near, port, said, the, canal, has, no, locks, because, of, the, flat, terrain, and, the, minor, sea, level, difference, between, each, end, is, inconsequential, for, shipping, as, the, canal, has, no, sea, surge, gates, the, ports, at, the, ends, would, be, subject, to, the, sudden, impact, of, tsunamis, from, the, mediterranean, sea, and, red, sea, according, to, a, 2012, article, in, the, journal, of, coastal, research, there, is, one, shipping, lane, with, passing, areas, in, ballah, bypass, near, el, qantara, and, in, the, great, bitter, lake, on, a, typical, day, three, convoys, transit, the, canal, two, southbound, and, one, northbound, the, passage, takes, between, 11, and, 16, hours, at, a, speed, of, around, 8, knots, 15, km, h, 9, mph, the, low, speed, helps, prevent, erosion, of, the, banks, by, ships, wakes, by, 1955, about, two, thirds, of, europe, s, oil, passed, through, the, canal, around, 8, of, world, sea, trade, is, carried, via, the, canal, in, 2008, 21, 415, vessels, passed, through, the, canal, and, the, receipts, totalled, 5, 381, billion, with, an, average, cost, per, ship, of, 251, 000, new, rules, of, navigation, came, into, force, on, 1, january, 2008, passed, by, the, board, of, directors, of, the, suez, canal, authority, sca, to, organise, vessels, transit, the, most, important, amendments, include, allowing, vessels, with, 19, metre, 62, ft, draught, to, pass, increasing, the, allowed, breadth, from, 32, to, 40, metres, 105, to, 131, ft, following, improvement, operations, and, imposing, a, fine, on, vessels, using, pilots, from, outside, the, sca, inside, the, canal, boundaries, without, permission, the, amendments, allow, vessels, loaded, with, dangerous, cargo, such, as, radioactive, or, flammable, materials, to, pass, if, they, conform, with, the, latest, amendments, provided, by, international, conventions, the, sca, has, the, right, to, determine, the, number, of, tugs, required, to, assist, warships, traversing, the, canal, to, achieve, the, highest, degree, of, safety, during, transit, before, august, 2015, the, canal, was, too, narrow, for, free, two, way, traffic, so, ships, had, to, pass, in, convoys, and, use, bypasses, the, bypasses, were, 78, km, 48, mi, out, of, 193, km, 120, mi, 40, from, north, to, south, they, are, port, said, bypass, entrances, 36, 5, km, 23, mi, ballah, bypass, anchorage, 9, km, 6, mi, timsah, bypass, 5, km, 3, mi, and, the, deversoir, bypass, northern, end, of, the, great, bitter, lake, 27, 5, kilometres, 17, mi, the, bypasses, were, completed, in, 1980, typically, it, would, take, a, ship, 12, to, 16, hours, to, transit, the, canal, the, canal, s, 24, hour, capacity, was, about, 76, standard, ships, in, august, 2014, egypt, chose, a, consortium, that, includes, the, egyptian, army, and, global, engineering, firm, dar, al, handasah, to, develop, an, international, industrial, and, logistics, hub, in, the, suez, canal, area, and, began, the, construction, of, a, new, canal, section, from, 60, to, 95, km, 37, to, 59, mi, combined, with, expansion, and, deep, digging, of, the, other, 37, km, 23, mi, of, the, canal, this, will, allow, navigation, in, both, directions, simultaneously, in, the, 72, kilometre, long, 45, mi, central, section, of, the, canal, these, extensions, were, formally, opened, on, 6, august, 2015, by, president, al, sisi, since, the, canal, does, not, cater, to, unregulated, two, way, traffic, all, ships, transit, in, convoys, on, regular, times, scheduled, on, a, 24, hour, basis, each, day, a, single, northbound, convoy, starts, at, 04, 00, eet, from, suez, at, dual, lane, sections, the, convoy, uses, the, eastern, route, synchronised, with, this, convoy, s, passage, is, the, southbound, convoy, it, starts, at, 03, 30, eet, from, port, said, and, so, passes, the, northbound, convoy, in, the, two, lane, section, from, north, to, south, the, crossings, are, a, railway, on, the, west, bank, runs, parallel, to, the, canal, for, its, entire, length, the, five, pontoon, bridges, were, opened, between, 2016, and, 2019, they, are, designed, to, be, movable, and, can, be, completely, rotated, against, the, banks, of, the, canal, to, allow, shipping, through, or, else, individual, sections, can, be, moved, to, create, a, narrower, channel, six, new, tunnels, for, cars, and, trains, are, also, planned, across, the, canal, currently, the, ahmed, hamdi, is, the, only, tunnel, connecting, suez, to, the, sinai, economically, after, its, completion, the, suez, canal, benefited, primarily, the, sea, trading, powers, of, the, mediterranean, countries, which, now, had, much, faster, connections, to, the, near, and, far, east, than, the, north, and, west, european, sea, trading, nations, such, as, great, britain, or, germany, the, main, habsburg, trading, port, of, trieste, with, its, direct, connections, to, central, europe, experienced, a, meteoric, rise, at, that, time, the, time, saved, in, the, 19th, century, for, an, assumed, steamship, trip, to, bombay, from, brindisi, and, trieste, was, 37, days, from, genoa, 32, from, marseille, 31, from, bordeaux, liverpool, london, amsterdam, and, hamburg, 24, days, at, that, time, it, was, also, necessary, to, consider, whether, the, goods, to, be, transported, could, bear, the, costly, canal, tariff, this, led, to, a, rapid, growth, of, mediterranean, ports, with, their, land, routes, to, central, and, eastern, europe, according, to, today, s, information, from, the, shipping, companies, the, route, from, singapore, to, rotterdam, through, the, suez, canal, will, be, shortened, by, 6, 000, kilometres, 3, 700, mi, and, thus, by, nine, days, compared, to, the, route, around, africa, as, a, result, liner, services, between, asia, and, europe, save, 44, per, cent, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, thanks, to, this, shorter, route, the, suez, canal, has, a, correspondingly, important, role, in, the, connection, between, east, africa, and, the, mediterranean, region, in, the, 20th, century, trade, through, the, suez, canal, came, to, a, standstill, several, times, due, to, the, two, world, wars, and, the, suez, canal, crisis, many, trade, flows, were, also, shifted, away, from, the, mediterranean, ports, towards, northern, european, terminals, such, as, hamburg, and, rotterdam, only, after, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, growth, in, european, economic, integration, the, consideration, of, co, 2, emission, and, the, chinese, silk, road, initiative, are, mediterranean, ports, such, as, piraeus, and, trieste, again, at, the, focus, of, growth, and, investment, the, suez, canal, set, a, new, record, with, annual, revenue, of, 9, 4, billion, in, usd, for, the, fiscal, year, that, ended, 30, june, 2023, before, the, canal, s, opening, in, 1869, goods, were, sometimes, offloaded, from, ships, and, carried, overland, between, the, mediterranean, and, the, red, sea, the, main, alternative, is, around, cape, agulhas, the, southernmost, point, of, africa, commonly, referred, to, as, the, cape, of, good, hope, route, this, was, the, only, sea, route, before, the, canal, was, constructed, and, when, the, canal, was, closed, it, is, still, the, only, route, for, ships, that, are, too, large, for, the, canal, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, suez, canal, has, suffered, from, diminished, traffic, due, to, piracy, in, somalia, with, many, shipping, companies, choosing, to, take, the, long, route, instead, between, 2008, and, 2010, it, is, estimated, that, the, canal, lost, 10, of, traffic, due, to, the, threat, of, piracy, and, another, 10, due, to, the, financial, crisis, an, oil, tanker, going, from, saudi, arabia, to, the, united, states, has, 4, 345, km, 2, 700, mi, farther, to, go, when, taking, the, route, south, of, africa, rather, than, the, canal, in, recent, years, the, shrinking, arctic, sea, ice, has, made, the, northern, sea, route, feasible, for, commercial, cargo, ships, between, europe, and, east, asia, during, a, six, to, eight, week, window, in, the, summer, months, shortening, the, voyage, by, thousands, of, kilometres, compared, to, that, through, the, suez, canal, according, to, polar, climate, researchers, as, the, extent, of, the, arctic, summer, ice, pack, recedes, the, route, will, become, passable, without, the, help, of, icebreakers, for, a, greater, period, each, summer, the, bremen, based, beluga, group, claimed, in, 2009, to, be, the, first, western, company, to, attempt, using, the, northern, sea, route, without, assistance, from, icebreakers, cutting, 6, 400, kilometres, 4, 000, mi, off, the, journey, between, ulsan, korea, and, rotterdam, the, netherlands, sailing, ships, such, as, the, windjammers, in, the, heyday, of, the, great, grain, race, between, australia, and, europe, during, the, 1930s, often, preferred, the, cape, horn, route, when, going, to, europe, due, to, prevalent, wind, directions, even, though, it, is, slightly, longer, from, sydney, to, europe, this, way, than, past, cape, agulhas, in, february, 2012, israel, announced, its, intention, to, construct, a, railway, between, the, mediterranean, and, eilat, through, the, negev, desert, to, compete, with, the, canal, by, 2019, the, project, had, been, put, on, indefinite, hold, the, opening, of, the, canal, created, the, first, salt, water, passage, between, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, red, sea, although, the, red, sea, is, about, 1, 2, m, 4, ft, higher, than, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, current, between, the, mediterranean, and, the, middle, of, the, canal, at, the, bitter, lakes, flows, north, in, winter, and, south, in, summer, the, current, south, of, the, bitter, lakes, is, tidal, varying, with, the, tide, at, suez, the, bitter, lakes, which, were, hypersaline, natural, lakes, blocked, the, migration, of, red, sea, species, into, the, mediterranean, for, many, decades, but, as, the, salinity, of, the, lakes, gradually, equalised, with, that, of, the, red, sea, the, barrier, to, migration, was, removed, and, plants, and, animals, from, the, red, sea, have, begun, to, colonise, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, red, sea, is, generally, saltier, and, less, nutrient, rich, than, the, mediterranean, so, that, erythrean, species, will, often, do, well, in, the, milder, eastern, mediterranean, environment, to, the, contrary, very, few, mediterranean, species, have, been, able, to, settle, in, the, harsher, conditions, of, the, red, sea, the, dominant, south, to, north, migratory, passage, across, the, canal, is, often, called, lessepsian, migration, after, ferdinand, de, lesseps, or, erythrean, invasion, the, recent, construction, by, the, egyptian, government, of, a, major, canal, extension, allowing, for, two, way, traffic, in, the, central, section, of, the, canal, and, finally, implemented, in, 2015, raised, concerns, from, marine, biologists, who, fear, that, it, will, enhance, the, arrival, of, red, sea, species, in, the, mediterranean, exotic, species, from, the, indo, pacific, ocean, and, introduced, into, the, mediterranean, via, the, canal, since, the, 1880s, have, become, a, significant, component, of, the, mediterranean, ecosystem, they, already, impact, its, ecology, endangering, some, local, and, endemic, species, since, the, piercing, of, the, canal, over, a, thousand, species, from, the, red, sea, plankton, seaweeds, invertebrates, fishes, have, been, recorded, in, the, mediterranean, and, many, others, will, clearly, follow, the, resulting, change, in, biodiversity, is, without, precedent, in, human, memory, and, is, accelerating, a, long, term, cross, basin, survey, engaged, by, the, mediterranean, science, commission, recently, documented, that, in, the, first, twenty, years, of, this, century, more, exotic, fish, species, from, the, indian, ocean, had, reached, the, mediterranean, than, during, the, entire, 20th, century, historically, the, construction, of, the, canal, was, preceded, by, cutting, a, small, fresh, water, canal, called, sweet, water, canal, from, the, nile, delta, along, wadi, tumilat, to, the, future, canal, with, a, southern, branch, to, suez, and, a, northern, branch, to, port, said, completed, in, 1863, these, brought, fresh, water, to, a, previously, arid, area, initially, for, canal, construction, and, subsequently, facilitating, growth, of, agriculture, and, settlements, along, the, canal, however, the, aswan, high, dam, construction, across, the, nile, which, started, operating, in, 1968, much, reduced, the, inflow, of, freshwater, and, cut, all, natural, nutrient, rich, silt, entering, the, eastern, mediterranean, at, the, nile, delta, the, suez, canal, economic, zone, sometimes, shortened, to, sczone, describes, the, set, of, locations, neighbouring, the, canal, where, customs, rates, have, been, reduced, to, zero, in, order, to, attract, investment, the, zone, comprises, over, 461, km, 2, 178, sq, mi, within, the, governorates, of, port, said, ismailia, and, suez, projects, in, the, zone, are, collectively, described, as, the, suez, canal, area, development, project, scadp, the, plan, focuses, on, development, of, east, port, said, and, the, port, of, ain, sokhna, and, hopes, to, extend, to, four, more, ports, at, west, port, said, el, adabiya, arish, and, el, tor, the, zone, incorporates, the, four, qualifying, industrial, zones, at, port, said, ismailia, and, suez, a, 1996, american, initiative, to, encourage, economic, ties, between, israel, and, its, neighbours
