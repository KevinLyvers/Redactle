the, weddell, sea, is, part, of, the, southern, ocean, and, contains, the, weddell, gyre, its, land, boundaries, are, defined, by, the, bay, formed, from, the, coasts, of, coats, land, and, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, easternmost, point, is, cape, norvegia, at, princess, martha, coast, queen, maud, land, to, the, east, of, cape, norvegia, is, the, king, haakon, vii, sea, much, of, the, southern, part, of, the, sea, is, covered, by, a, permanent, massive, ice, shelf, field, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, the, sea, is, contained, within, the, two, overlapping, antarctic, territorial, claims, of, argentine, antarctica, the, british, antarctic, territory, and, also, resides, partially, within, the, antarctic, chilean, territory, at, its, widest, the, sea, is, around, 2, 000, kilometres, 1, 200, mi, across, and, its, area, is, around, 2, 8, million, square, kilometres, 1, 1, 10, 6, sq, mi, various, ice, shelves, including, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, fringe, the, weddell, sea, some, of, the, ice, shelves, on, the, east, side, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, which, formerly, covered, roughly, 10, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 900, sq, mi, of, the, weddell, sea, had, completely, disappeared, by, 2002, the, weddell, sea, has, been, deemed, by, scientists, to, have, the, clearest, water, of, any, sea, researchers, from, the, alfred, wegener, institute, on, finding, a, secchi, disc, visible, at, a, depth, of, 80, metres, 260, ft, on, 13, october, 1986, ascertained, that, the, clarity, corresponded, to, that, of, distilled, water, in, his, 1950, book, the, white, continent, historian, thomas, r, henry, writes, the, weddell, sea, is, according, to, the, testimony, of, all, who, have, sailed, through, its, berg, filled, waters, the, most, treacherous, and, dismal, region, on, earth, the, ross, sea, is, relatively, peaceful, predictable, and, safe, he, continues, for, an, entire, chapter, relating, myths, of, the, green, haired, merman, sighted, in, the, sea, s, icy, waters, the, inability, of, crews, to, navigate, a, path, to, the, coast, until, 1949, and, treacherous, flash, freezes, that, left, ships, such, as, ernest, shackleton, s, endurance, at, the, mercy, of, the, ice, floes, the, sea, is, named, after, the, scottish, sailor, james, weddell, who, entered, the, sea, in, 1823, and, originally, named, it, after, king, george, iv, it, was, renamed, in, weddell, s, honour, in, 1900, also, in, 1823, the, american, sealing, captain, benjamin, morrell, claimed, to, have, seen, land, some, 10, 12, east, of, the, sea, s, actual, eastern, boundary, he, called, this, new, south, greenland, but, its, existence, was, disproved, when, the, sea, was, more, fully, explored, in, the, early, 20th, century, weddell, got, as, far, south, as, 74, s, the, furthest, southern, penetration, since, weddell, but, before, the, modern, era, was, made, by, william, speirs, bruce, in, 1903, the, weddell, sea, is, an, important, area, of, deep, water, mass, formation, through, cabbeling, the, main, driving, force, of, the, thermohaline, circulation, deepwater, masses, are, also, formed, through, cabbeling, in, the, north, atlantic, and, are, caused, by, differences, in, temperature, and, salinity, of, the, water, in, the, weddell, sea, this, is, brought, about, mainly, by, brine, exclusion, and, wind, cooling, in, 1823, british, sailor, james, weddell, discovered, the, weddell, sea, otto, nordenski, ld, leader, of, the, 1901, 1904, swedish, antarctic, expedition, spent, a, winter, at, snow, hill, with, a, team, of, four, men, when, the, relief, ship, became, beset, in, ice, and, was, crushed, the, crew, managed, to, reach, paulet, island, where, they, wintered, in, a, primitive, hut, nordenski, ld, and, the, others, were, eventually, picked, up, by, the, argentine, navy, at, hope, bay, all, but, one, survived, the, ordeal, the, antarctic, sound, is, named, after, the, expedition, ship, of, otto, nordenski, ld, the, sound, that, separates, the, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, from, dundee, island, is, also, referred, to, as, iceberg, alley, because, of, the, huge, icebergs, that, are, often, seen, here, snowhill, island, located, east, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, almost, completely, snow, capped, hence, its, name, the, swedish, antarctic, expedition, under, otto, nordenski, ld, built, a, cabin, on, the, island, in, 1902, where, nordenski, ld, and, three, members, of, the, expedition, had, to, spend, two, winters, in, 1915, ernest, shackleton, s, ship, endurance, got, trapped, and, was, crushed, by, ice, in, this, sea, after, 15, months, on, the, pack, ice, shackleton, and, his, men, managed, to, reach, elephant, island, and, safely, returned, home, in, march, 2022, it, was, announced, that, the, well, preserved, wreck, of, the, endurance, had, been, discovered, four, miles, 6, 4, km, from, its, anticipated, location, at, a, depth, of, 3, 008, metres, 9, 869, ft, as, with, other, neighboring, parts, of, antarctica, the, weddell, sea, shares, a, common, geological, history, with, southernmost, south, america, in, southern, patagonia, at, the, onset, of, the, andean, orogeny, in, the, jurassic, extensional, tectonics, created, the, rocas, verdes, basin, a, back, arc, basin, whose, surviving, southeastward, extension, forms, the, weddell, sea, in, the, late, cretaceous, the, tectonic, regime, of, rocas, verdes, basin, changed, leading, to, its, transformation, into, a, compressional, foreland, basin, the, magallanes, basin, in, the, cenozoic, while, this, happened, in, south, america, the, weddell, sea, part, of, the, basin, escaped, compressional, tectonics, and, remained, an, oceanic, basin, the, weddell, sea, is, one, of, few, locations, in, the, world, ocean, where, deep, and, bottom, water, masses, are, formed, to, contribute, to, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, which, has, been, warming, slowly, over, the, last, decade, the, characteristics, of, exported, water, masses, result, from, complex, interactions, between, surface, forcing, significantly, modified, by, sea, ice, processes, ocean, dynamics, at, the, continental, shelf, break, and, slope, and, sub, ice, shelf, water, mass, transformation, circulation, in, the, western, weddell, sea, is, dominated, by, a, northward, flowing, current, this, northward, current, is, the, western, section, of, a, primarily, wind, driven, cyclonic, gyre, called, the, weddell, gyre, this, northward, flow, serves, as, the, primary, force, of, departure, of, water, from, the, weddell, sea, a, major, site, of, ocean, water, modification, and, deep, water, formation, to, the, remainder, of, the, world, ocean, the, weddell, gyre, is, a, cold, low, salinity, surface, layer, separated, by, a, thin, weak, pycnocline, from, a, thick, layer, of, relatively, warm, and, salty, water, referred, to, as, weddell, deep, water, wdw, and, a, cold, bottom, layer, circulation, in, the, weddell, sea, has, proven, difficult, to, quantify, geopotential, surface, heights, above, the, 1000, db, level, computed, using, historical, data, show, only, very, weak, surface, currents, similar, computations, carried, out, using, more, closely, spaced, data, also, showed, small, currents, closure, of, the, gyre, circulation, was, assumed, to, be, driven, by, sverdrup, transport, the, weddell, sea, is, a, major, site, for, deep, water, formation, thus, in, addition, to, a, wind, driven, gyre, component, of, the, boundary, current, a, deeper, circulation, whose, dynamics, and, transports, reflect, an, input, of, dense, water, in, the, southern, and, southwestern, weddell, sea, are, expected, available, data, does, not, lend, to, the, quantification, of, the, volume, transports, associated, with, this, western, boundary, region, or, to, the, determination, of, deep, convective, circulation, along, the, western, boundary, the, predominance, of, strong, surface, winds, parallel, to, the, narrow, and, tall, mountain, range, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, is, a, remarkable, feature, of, weather, and, climate, in, the, area, of, the, western, weddell, sea, the, winds, carry, cold, air, toward, lower, latitudes, and, turn, into, southwesterlies, farther, north, these, winds, are, of, interest, not, only, because, of, their, effect, on, the, temperature, regime, east, of, the, peninsula, but, also, because, they, force, the, drift, of, ice, northeastward, into, the, south, atlantic, ocean, as, the, last, branch, of, the, clockwise, circulation, in, the, lower, layers, of, the, atmosphere, along, the, coasts, of, the, weddell, sea, the, sharp, contrast, between, the, wind, temperature, and, ice, conditions, of, the, two, sides, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, has, been, well, known, for, many, years, strong, surface, winds, directed, equatorward, along, the, east, side, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, can, appear, in, two, different, types, of, synoptic, meteorological, situations, an, intense, cyclone, over, the, central, weddell, sea, a, broad, east, to, west, flow, of, stable, cold, air, in, the, lowest, 500, to, 1000, metre, layer, of, the, atmosphere, over, the, central, and, or, southern, weddell, sea, toward, the, peninsula, these, conditions, lead, to, cold, air, piling, up, on, the, east, edge, of, the, mountains, this, process, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, high, pressure, ridge, over, the, peninsula, mainly, east, of, the, peak, and, therefore, a, deflection, of, the, originally, westward, current, of, air, to, the, right, along, the, mountain, wall, the, weddell, sea, is, abundant, with, whales, and, seals, characteristic, fauna, of, the, sea, include, the, weddell, seal, and, killer, whales, humpback, whales, minke, whales, leopard, seals, and, crabeater, seals, are, frequently, seen, during, weddell, sea, voyages, the, ad, lie, penguin, is, the, dominant, penguin, species, in, this, remote, area, because, of, their, adaptation, to, the, harsh, environment, a, colony, of, more, than, 100, 000, pairs, of, ad, lies, can, be, found, on, volcanic, paulet, island, around, 1997, the, northernmost, emperor, penguin, colony, was, discovered, just, south, of, snowhill, island, in, the, weddell, sea, as, the, weddell, sea, is, often, clogged, with, heavy, pack, ice, strong, ice, class, vessels, equipped, with, helicopters, are, required, to, reach, this, colony, in, 2021, sponges, and, other, unidentified, suspension, feeders, were, reported, to, have, been, found, growing, under, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, on, a, boulder, at, a, depth, of, 1, 233, m, 872, of, which, were, ice, 260, km, from, open, water, in, february, 2021, the, alfred, wegener, institute, for, polar, and, marine, research, with, rv, polarstern, a, colony, of, approximately, 60, million, jonah, s, icefish, was, found, to, inhabit, an, area, in, the, weddell, sea, it, is, estimated, that, the, colony, covers, around, 240, square, kilometers, with, an, average, of, one, nest, per, every, three, square, meters, notes, bibliography, 75, s, 45, w, 75, s, 45, w, 75, 45
