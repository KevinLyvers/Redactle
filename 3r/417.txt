between, nouakchott, and, nouadhibou, and, is, the, former, mouth, of, the, tamanrasset, river, the, world, heritage, site, is, a, major, site, for, migratory, birds, and, breeding, birds, including, flamingos, pelicans, and, terns, much, of, the, breeding, is, on, sand, banks, including, the, islands, of, tidra, niroumi, nair, kijji, and, arguim, the, surrounding, waters, are, some, of, the, richest, fishing, waters, in, western, africa, and, serve, as, nesting, grounds, for, the, entire, western, region, the, banc, d, arguin, national, park, is, a, nature, reserve, that, was, established, in, 1976, to, protect, both, the, natural, resources, and, the, valuable, fisheries, which, makes, a, significant, contribution, to, the, national, economy, as, well, as, scientifically, and, aesthetically, valuable, geological, sites, in, the, interests, of, and, for, the, recreation, of, the, general, public, the, park, s, vast, expanses, of, mudflats, provide, a, home, for, over, one, million, migrant, shorebirds, from, northern, europe, siberia, and, greenland, the, region, s, mild, climate, and, absence, of, human, disturbance, makes, the, park, one, of, the, most, important, sites, in, the, world, for, these, species, the, nesting, bird, population, is, also, noted, for, its, great, numbers, and, diversity, between, 25, 000, and, 40, 000, pairs, belonging, to, 15, species, making, the, largest, colonies, of, water, birds, in, west, africa, the, extensive, intertidal, flats, of, parc, national, du, banc, d, arguin, shelters, on, the, most, pristine,

allowed, to, fish, in, the, park, boundaries, using, relatively, primitive, techniques, and, tools, no, motorized, boats, are, permitted, in, the, area, over, the, last, decade, however, the, international, shark, ray, market, made, its, way, to, pnba, locals, started, to, target, these, species, even, though, it, is, not, allowed, it, is, perhaps, the, most, challenging, issue, facing, conservation, in, the, park, the, local, population, comprises, about, 500, or, so, imraguen, tribesmen, that, live, in, seven, villages, within, the, park, they, base, their, economy, on, subsistence, fishing, using, traditional, methods, the, park, is, host, to, one, of, the, world, s, most, diversified, communities, of, nesting, piscivorous, birds, in, the, world, at, least, 108, bird, species, have, been, recorded, representing, both, palaearctic, and, afrotropical, realms, wintering, shorebirds, number, over, three, million, and, include, greater, flamingo, phoenicopterus,

largely, in, water, depths, 10, meters, below, sea, level, vast, areas, of, the, banc, d, arguin, are, covered, by, mixed, carbonate, siliciclastic, sediments, dominated, by, barnacles, and, mollusk,

mud, wedges, these, deposits, started, to, form, with, transgressional, inundation, early, in, the, holocene, and, have, grown, continuously, and, rapidly, over, the, past, 9, kyrs, locally, the, mud, wedge, deposits, are, incised, by, gullies, and, canyons, towards, the, shelf, break, lying, at, around, 80, 110m, the, southernmost, golfe, d, arguin, describes, a, homoclinal, ramp, profile, with, vast, intertidal, plains, around, tidra, island, because, of, its, rich, fishery, and, strategic, location, the, territory, has, been, highly, coveted, and, disputed, by, the, european, colonial, powers, of, portugal, france, england, brandenberg, prussia, and, holland, despite, the, almoravid, domination, of, spain, in, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, there, seems, to, be, little, evidence, of, contact, during, that, time, between, mauritania, and, europe, the, inhospitable, coastline, of, mauritania, continued, to, deter, voyagers, until, the, portuguese, began, their, african, explorations, in, the, fifteenth, century, lured, by, legends, of, vast, wealth, in, interior, kingdoms, the, portuguese, established, a, trading, fort, at, arguin, southeast, of, cap, blanc, present, day, ras, nouadhibou, in, 1455, the, king, of, portugal, also, maintained, a, commercial, agent, at, ouadane, in, the, adrar, in, an, attempt, to, divert, gold, traveling, north, by, caravan, having, only, slight, success, in, their, quest, for, gold, the, portuguese, quickly, adapted, to, dealing, in, slaves, in, the, mid, fifteenth, century, as, many, as, 1, 000, slaves, per, year, were, exported, from, arguin, to, europe, and, to, the, portuguese, sugar, plantations, on, the, island, of, s, o, tom, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, with, the, merger, of, the, portuguese, and, spanish, crowns, in, 1580, the, spaniards, became, the, dominant, influence, along, the, coast, in, 1638, however, they, were, replaced, by, the, dutch, who, were, the, first, to, begin, exploiting, the, gum, arabic, trade, produced, by, the, acacia, trees, of, trarza, and, brakna, and, used, in, textile, pattern, printing, this, gum, arabic, was, considered, superior, to, that, previously, obtained, in, arabia, by, 1678, the, french, had, driven, out, the, dutch, and, established, a, permanent, settlement, at, saint, louis, at, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, where, the, french, company, of, the, senegal, river, compagnie, fran, aise, du, s, n, gal, had, been, trading, for, more, than, fifty, years, the, moors, with, whom, the, europeans, were, trading, considered, the, constant, rivalries, between, european, powers, a, sign, of, weakness, and, they, quickly, learned, the, benefits, of, playing, one, power, against, the, other, for, example, they, agreed, simultaneously, to, give, monopolies, to, the, french, and, the, dutch, the, maures, also, took, advantage, of, the, europeans, whenever, possible, so, that, when, the, french, negotiated, with, the, amir, of, trarza, to, secure, a, monopoly, on, the, gum, arabic, trade, the, amir, in, exchange, demanded, a, considerable, number, of, gifts, thus, began, the, custom, an, annual, payment, expected, by, the, maures, for, doing, business, with, a, government, or, a, company, by, 1763, the, british, had, expelled, france, from, the, west, african, coast, and, france, recovered, control, only, when, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, recognized, french, sovereignty, over, the, coast, of, west, africa, from, cap, blanc, south, to, senegal
