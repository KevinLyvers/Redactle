lake, volta, the, largest, artificial, reservoir, in, the, world, based, on, surface, area, is, contained, behind, the, akosombo, dam, which, generates, a, substantial, amount, of, ghana, s, electricity, it, is, completely, within, the, country, of, ghana, and, has, a, surface, area, of, 8, 502, square, kilometres, 3, 283, sq, mi, it, extends, from, akosombo, in, the, south, to, the, northern, part, of, the, country, lake, volta, lies, along, the, prime, meridian, six, degrees, north, of, the, equator, the, lake, s, northernmost, point, is, close, to, the, town, of, yapei, and, its, southernmost, extreme, is, at, the, akosombo, dam, 520, km, 320, mi, downstream, from, yapei, akosombo, dam, holds, back, both, the, white, volta, river, and, the, black, volta, river, which, formerly, converged, where, the, middle, of, the, reservoir, now, lies, to, form, the, single, volta, river, the, present, volta, river, flows, from, the, outlets, of, the, dam, s, powerhouse, and, spillways, to, the, atlantic, ocean, in, southern, ghana, the, main, islands, within, the, lake, are, dodi, dwarf, and, kporve, digya, national, park, lies, on, part, of, the, lake, s, western, shore, the, lake, was, formed, by, the, akosombo, dam, which, was, originally, conceived, by, the, geologist, albert, ernest, kitson, during, the, british, colonial, period, in, 1915, to, exploit, the, river, s, energy, for, smelting, locally, sourced, bauxite, the, idea, regained, prominence, at, the, end, of, the, colonial, era, after, world, war, ii, when, kwame, nkrumah, became, president, of, the, gold, coast, colony, and, began, striving, for, modernization, of, the, land, british, and, local, governments, formed, a, joint, preparatory, commission, which, concluded, that, over, 60, 000, people, will, have, to, be, relocated, but, that, the, lake, will, boost, opportunities, for, fishing, thus, helping, to, feed, the, population, in, the, region, on, the, other, hand, issues, with, water, related, illnesses, were, predicted, such, as, malaria, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, and, onchocerciasis, aluminium, limited, the, main, industrial, sponsor, of, the, project, withdrew, after, ghana, became, independent, in, 1957, revised, plans, dropped, the, idea, of, integrated, aluminium, industry, and, proposed, smelting, imported, bauxite, instead, kaiser, aluminum, entered, the, project, at, this, point, and, after, protracted, negotiations, funding, for, the, project, was, secured, but, now, without, regard, to, residents, of, the, impacted, area, as, a, cost, cutting, measure, construction, thus, began, before, the, government, started, planning, the, resettlement, soon, after, a, public, agency, was, established, and, organized, construction, of, 52, replacement, towns, which, were, envisioned, to, serve, as, a, model, for, modernization, and, improving, the, livelihood, of, the, local, population, but, because, of, the, rush, the, resettlement, in, 1964, turned, out, to, be, chaotic, and, inefficient, poor, organization, caused, the, issues, to, continue, long, after, the, project, s, completion, and, caused, significant, hardship, to, the, local, population, together, 15, 000, homes, in, 740, villages, were, flooded, necessitating, resettlement, of, 78, 000, people, in, the, long, run, formation, of, the, lake, disrupted, traditional, fishing, and, farming, practices, in, the, region, and, caused, a, large, spike, in, disease, prevalence, government, led, modernization, did, not, succeed, and, people, had, to, adapt, to, the, new, circumstances, themselves, however, regional, food, production, intensified, in, the, decades, after, the, construction, of, akosombo, dam, and, the, lake, also, opened, a, large, navigable, pathway, to, the, north, of, the, country, and, provided, new, opportunities, for, development, of, tourism, which, is, gaining, in, prominence, on, the, other, hand, water, level, has, been, decreasing, recently, because, of, global, warming, reducing, power, generation, the, akosombo, dam, produces, 912, mw, of, electricity, for, the, country, as, well, as, for, export, to, togo, benin, and, other, nearby, countries, to, earn, foreign, exchange, lake, volta, is, also, important, for, transportation, providing, a, waterway, for, both, ferries, and, cargo, watercraft, since, the, huge, lake, lies, in, a, tropical, area, the, water, remains, warm, year, round, naturally, given, good, management, lake, volta, is, the, location, of, a, vast, population, of, fish, and, large, fisheries, the, lake, also, attracts, tourism, and, tourist, cruises, visit, the, island, of, dodi, recent, developments, include, a, large, scale, enterprise, to, harvest, submerged, timber, from, the, flooded, forests, under, lake, volta, this, project, harvests, high, value, tropical, hardwood, without, requiring, additional, logging, or, destruction, of, existing, forest, and, according, to, wayne, dunn, could, generate, the, largest, source, of, environmentally, sustainable, natural, tropical, hardwood, in, the, world, in, addition, to, generating, foreign, currency, for, the, region, and, reducing, the, dependence, of, locals, on, fishing, as, a, primary, economic, activity, the, removal, of, submerged, trees, is, improving, navigation, on, the, lake, and, increasing, safety, an, estimated, 7, 000, to, 10, 000, children, work, in, the, fishing, industry, on, lake, volta, the, nature, of, their, employment, has, been, described, as, slavery, in, the, guardian, and, by, the, cnn, freedom, project, this, has, been, described, as, sensationalism, by, betty, mensah, and, the, academic, samuel, okyere, since, many, of, the, children, and, youth, whose, wages, are, given, upfront, to, their, parents, grow, up, to, become, self, sufficient, fishermen, in, adulthood, who, in, turn, hire, children, themselves, and, could, therefore, also, be, characterized, as, apprentices, they, conclude, that, many, children, may, suffer, under, exploitative, work, but, are, not, enslaved
