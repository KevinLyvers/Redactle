produce, an, arid, atmosphere, around, the, archipelago, conversely, the, islands, do, not, receive, the, upwelling, cold, streams, that, affect, the, west, african, coast, so, the, air, temperature, is, cooler, than, in, senegal, but, the, sea, is, warmer, due, to, the, relief, of, some, islands, such, as, santiago, with, its, steep, mountains, the, islands, can, have, orographically, induced,

have, a, flat, landscape, and, arid, climate, whilst, the, other, islands, are, generally, rockier, and, have, more, vegetation, because, of, the, infrequent, occurrence, of, rainfall, where, not, mountainous, the, landscape, is, so, arid, that, less, than, two, percent, of, it, is, arable, the, archipelago, can, be, divided, into, four, broad, ecological, zones, arid, semiarid, subhumid, and, humid, according, to, altitude, and, average, annual, rainfall, ranging, from, less, than, 100, millimetres, 3, 9, inches, in, the, arid, areas, of, the, coast, as, in, the, deserto, de, viana, 67, millimetres, 2, 6, inches, in, sal, rei, to, more, than, 1, 000, millimetres, 39, inches, in, the, humid, mountain, most, rainfall, precipitation, is, due, to, condensation, of, the, ocean, mist, in,

as, cape, verde, type, hurricanes, these, hurricanes, can, become, very, intense, as, they, cross, warm, atlantic, waters, away, from, cape, verde, the, average, hurricane, season, has, about, two, cape, verde, type, hurricanes, which, are, usually, the, largest, and, most, intense, storms, of, the, season, because, they, often, have, plenty, of, warm, open, ocean, over, which, to, develop, before, encountering, land, the, five, largest, atlantic, tropical, cyclones, on, record, have, been, cape, verde, type, hurricanes, most, of, the, longest, lived, tropical, cyclones, in, the,
