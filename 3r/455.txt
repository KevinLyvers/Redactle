october, 2005, paper, by, the, comoros, ministry, of, planning, and, regional, development, however, reported, that, registered, unemployment, rate, is, 14, 3, percent, distributed, very, unevenly, among, and, within, the, islands, but, with, marked, incidence, in, urban, areas, in, 2019, more, than, 56, of, the, labor, force, was, employed, in, agriculture, with, 29, employed, in, industry, and, 14, employed, in, services, the, islands, agricultural, sector, is, based, on, the, export, of, spices, including, vanilla, cinnamon, and, cloves, and, thus, susceptible, to, price, fluctuations,

what, is, still, a, mostly, rural, agricultural, economy, may, lead, to, an, environmental, crisis, in, the, near, future, especially, considering, the, high, rate, of, population, growth, in, 2004, the, comoros, real, gdp, growth, was, a, low, 1, 9, and, real, gdp, per, capita, continued, to, decline, these, declines, are, explained, by, factors, including, declining, investment, drops, in,

the, archipelago, the, ada, is, often, criticized, because, of, its, great, expense, but, at, the, same, time, it, is, a, source, of, social, cohesion, and, the, main, reason, why, migrants, in,
