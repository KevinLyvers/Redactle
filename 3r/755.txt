not, agreed, on, an, exact, definition, but, the, following, may, serve, as, a, starting, point, neighbourhood, is, generally, defined, spatially, as, a, specific, geographic, area, and, functionally, as, a, set, of, social, networks, neighbourhoods, then, are, the, spatial, units, in, which, face, to, face, social, interactions, occur, the, personal, settings, and, situations, where, residents, seek, to, realise, common, values, socialise, youth, and, maintain, effective, social, control, in, the, words, of, the, urban, scholar, lewis, mumford, neighborhoods, in, some, annoying, inchoate, fashion, exist, wherever, human, beings, congregate, in, permanent, family, dwellings, and, many, of, the, functions, of, the, city, tend, to, be, distributed, naturally, that, is, without, any, theoretical, preoccupation, or, political, direction, into, neighborhoods, most, of, the, earliest, cities, around, the, world, as, excavated, by, archaeologists, have, evidence, for, the, presence, of, social, neighbourhoods, historical, documents, shed, light, on, neighbourhood, life, in, numerous, historical, preindustrial, or, nonwestern, cities, neighbourhoods, are, typically, generated, by, social, interaction, among, people, living, near, one, another, in, this, sense, they, are, local, social, units, larger, than, households, not, directly, under, the, control, of, city, or, state,

of, regulation, of, social, life, by, officials, for, example, in, the, tang, period, chinese, capital, city, chang, an, neighbourhoods, were, districts, and, there, were, state, officials, who,

neighbourhoods, were, important, in, many, past, cities, and, remain, common, in, cities, today, economic, specialists, including, craft, producers, merchants, and, others, could, be, concentrated, in, neighbourhoods, and, in, societies, with, religious, pluralism, neighbourhoods, were, often, specialised, by, religion, one, factor, contributing, to, neighbourhood, distinctiveness, and, social, cohesion, in, past, cities, was, the, role, of, rural, to, urban, migration, this, was, a, continual, process, in, preindustrial, cities, and, migrants, tended, to, move, in, with, relatives, and,
