much, of, the, year, dakar, is, cooled, year, round, by, sea, breezes, a, 2019, paper, published, in, plos, one, estimated, that, under, representative, concentration, pathway, 4, 5, a, moderate, scenario, of, climate, change, where, global, warming, reaches, 2, 5, 3, c, 4, 5, 5, 4, f, by, 2100, the, climate, of, dakar, in, the, year, 2050, would, most, closely, resemble, the, current, climate, of, praia, in, cape, verde, the, annual, temperature, would, increase, by, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, and, the, temperature, of, the, warmest, and, the, coldest, month, by, 1, 4, c, 2, 5, f, and, 1, 6, c, 2, 9, f, respectively, according, to, climate, action, tracker, the, current, warming, trajectory, appears, consistent, with, 2, 7, c, 4, 9, f, which, closely, matches, rcp, 4, 5, moreover,

lom, luanda, and, maputo, which, would, be, the, most, severely, affected, by, future, sea, level, rise, it, estimates, that, they, would, collectively, sustain, cumulative, damages, of, us, 65, billion, under, rcp, 4, 5, and, us, 86, 5, billion, for, the, high, emission, scenario, rcp, 8, 5, by, the, year, 2050, additionally, rcp, 8, 5, combined, with, the, hypothetical, impact, from, marine, ice, sheet, instability, at, high, levels, of, warming, would, involve, up, to, us, 137, 5, billion, in, damages, while, the, additional, accounting, for, the, low, probability, high, damage, events, may, increase, aggregate, risks, to, us, 187, billion, for, the, moderate, rcp4, 5, us, 206, billion, for, rcp8, 5, and, us, 397, billion, under, the, high, end, ice, sheet, instability, scenario, since, sea, level, rise, would, continue, for, about, 10, 000, years, under, every, scenario, of, climate, change, future, costs, of, sea, level, rise, would, only, increase, especially, without, adaptation, measures, the, city, of, dakar, is, a, commune, also, sometimes, known, as, commune, de, ville, one, of, the, 125, communes, of, senegal, the, commune, of, dakar, was, created,
