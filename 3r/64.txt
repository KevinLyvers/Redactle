the, philippine, sea, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, western, pacific, ocean, east, of, the, philippine, archipelago, hence, the, name, and, the, largest, sea, in, the, world, occupying, an, estimated, surface, area, of, 5, million, square, kilometers, 2, 10, 6, sq, mi, the, philippine, sea, plate, forms, the, floor, of, the, sea, its, western, border, is, the, first, island, chain, to, the, west, comprising, the, ryukyu, islands, in, the, northwest, and, taiwan, in, the, west, its, southwestern, border, comprises, the, philippine, islands, of, luzon, catanduanes, samar, leyte, and, mindanao, its, northern, border, comprises, the, japanese, islands, of, honshu, shikoku, and, ky, sh, its, eastern, border, is, the, second, island, chain, to, the, east, comprising, the, bonin, islands, and, iwo, jima, in, the, northeast, the, mariana, islands, including, guam, saipan, and, tinian, in, the, due, east, and, halmahera, palau, yap, and, ulithi, of, the, caroline, islands, in, the, southeast, its, southern, border, is, indonesia, s, morotai, island, the, sea, has, a, complex, and, diverse, undersea, relief, the, floor, is, formed, into, a, structural, basin, by, a, series, of, geologic, faults, and, fracture, zones, island, arcs, which, are, actually, extended, ridges, protruding, above, the, ocean, surface, due, to, plate, tectonic, activity, in, the, area, enclose, the, philippine, sea, to, the, north, east, and, south, the, philippine, archipelago, ryukyu, islands, and, the, marianas, are, examples, another, prominent, feature, of, the, philippine, sea, is, the, presence, of, deep, sea, trenches, among, them, the, philippine, trench, and, the, mariana, trench, containing, the, deepest, point, on, the, planet, the, philippine, sea, has, the, philippines, and, taiwan, to, the, west, japan, to, the, north, the, marianas, to, the, east, and, palau, to, the, south, adjacent, seas, include, the, celebes, sea, which, is, separated, by, mindanao, and, smaller, islands, to, the, south, the, south, china, sea, which, is, separated, by, philippines, and, the, east, china, sea, which, is, separated, by, the, ryukyu, islands, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, philippine, sea, as, that, area, of, the, north, pacific, ocean, off, the, eastern, coasts, of, the, philippine, islands, bounded, as, follows, on, the, west, by, the, eastern, limits, of, the, east, indian, archipelago, south, china, sea, and, east, china, sea, on, the, north, by, the, southeast, coast, of, kyushu, the, southern, and, eastern, limits, of, the, inland, sea, and, the, south, coast, of, honshu, island, on, the, east, by, the, ridge, joining, japan, to, the, bonin, volcano, and, ladrone, mariana, islands, all, these, being, included, in, the, philippine, sea, on, the, south, by, a, line, joining, guam, yap, pelew, palau, and, halmahera, islands, the, philippine, sea, plate, forms, the, floor, of, the, philippine, sea, it, subducts, under, the, philippine, mobile, belt, which, carries, most, of, the, philippine, archipelago, and, eastern, taiwan, between, the, two, plates, is, the, philippine, trench, the, philippine, sea, has, a, marine, territorial, scope, of, over, 679, 800, square, kilometers, 262, 500, sq, mi, and, an, eez, of, 2, 2, million, km, 2, attributed, to, an, extensive, vicariance, and, island, integrations, the, philippines, contains, the, highest, number, of, marine, species, per, unit, area, relative, to, the, countries, within, the, indo, malay, philippines, archipelago, and, has, been, identified, as, the, epicenter, of, marine, biodiversity, with, its, inclusion, in, the, coral, triangle, the, philippine, sea, encompasses, over, 3, 212, fish, species, 486, coral, species, 800, seaweed, species, and, 820, benthic, algae, species, wherein, the, verde, island, passage, is, dubbed, as, the, center, of, the, center, of, marine, fish, biodiversity, within, its, territory, thirty, three, endemic, species, of, fish, have, been, identified, including, the, blue, spotted, angelfish, chaetodontoplus, caeruleopunctatus, and, the, sea, catfish, arius, manillensis, the, philippine, marine, territory, has, also, become, a, breeding, and, feeding, ground, for, endangered, marine, species, such, as, the, whale, shark, rhincodon, typus, the, dugong, dugong, dugon, and, the, megamouth, shark, megachasma, pelagios, within, the, south, china, sea, philippine, scientists, have, discovered, an, abundant, amount, of, marine, life, and, species, that, have, the, potential, to, be, biomedical, advances, for, the, philippines, as, well, the, coral, triangle, also, called, the, indo, malayan, triangle, is, considered, to, be, the, global, center, of, marine, biodiversity, its, total, oceanic, area, is, approximately, 2, million, square, kilometers, it, encompasses, the, tropical, waters, of, malaysia, indonesia, the, philippines, timor, leste, papua, new, guinea, and, solomon, islands, the, philippine, islands, which, lie, at, its, apex, make, up, 300, 000, square, kilometers, 120, 000, sq, mi, of, it, the, part, of, the, coral, triangle, s, coral, reef, area, that, lies, within, the, philippines, ranges, from, 10, 750, square, kilometers, 4, 150, sq, mi, to, 33, 500, square, kilometers, 12, 900, sq, mi, it, contains, over, 500, species, of, scleractinian, or, stony, corals, and, at, least, 12, endemic, coral, species, the, coral, triangle, contains, 75, of, the, world, s, coral, species, around, 600, species, it, is, home, to, over, 2000, types, of, reef, fish, and, six, of, the, world, s, seven, species, of, marine, turtles, the, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, green, turtle, olive, ridley, and, sea, turtle, there, is, no, single, causal, explanation, for, the, unusually, high, biodiversity, found, in, the, coral, triangle, but, most, researchers, have, attributed, it, to, geological, factors, such, as, plate, tectonics, the, philippine, sea, provides, or, supports, the, livelihoods, of, 120, million, people, and, is, a, source, of, food, for, the, philippine, coastal, communities, and, for, millions, more, people, worldwide, whale, shark, tourism, in, the, coral, triangle, also, provides, a, steady, source, of, income, for, the, surrounding, community, the, marine, resources, in, the, coral, triangle, have, a, high, economic, value, not, only, in, the, philippines, but, across, the, globe, the, countries, surrounding, the, coral, triangle, work, to, provide, their, people, with, technical, assistance, and, other, resources, needed, to, promote, conservation, sustainability, biodiversity, food, security, sources, of, livelihood, and, economic, development, climate, change, is, affecting, the, coastal, ecosystem, found, in, the, coral, triangle, it, is, contributing, to, rising, sea, levels, and, ocean, acidification, thus, endangering, marine, animals, like, fish, and, turtles, this, has, a, negative, effect, on, local, sources, of, livelihood, such, as, fishing, and, tourism, it, is, also, making, the, waters, warmer, which, endangers, corals, warmer, water, causes, corals, to, absorb, more, carbon, dioxide, this, alters, the, water, s, ph, balance, making, it, acidic, a, condition, to, which, the, corals, are, not, adapted, and, in, which, they, are, ill, equipped, to, survive, the, philippine, sea, hosts, an, exotic, marine, ecosystem, there, are, 421, of, the, 577, known, species, of, corals, in, coastal, waters, including, 19, seagrass, species, and, 30, species, of, mangrove, both, of, which, contribute, nutrients, to, coral, systems, the, philippines, also, consists, of, 20, percent, of, the, shellfish, globally, sea, turtles, sharks, moray, eels, octopuses, and, sea, snakes, along, with, numerous, species, of, fish, such, as, tuna, can, commonly, be, observed, additionally, the, philippine, sea, serves, as, spawning, ground, for, japanese, eel, tuna, and, different, whale, species, the, philippine, sea, is, a, centre, of, marine, biodiversity, as, well, as, a, biodiversity, hotspot, however, at, least, 418, species, are, being, threatened, because, of, unsustainable, practices, the, rise, in, temperature, change, caused, shifts, in, the, marine, ecosystems, which, could, cause, corals, to, die, due, to, changing, sea, temperature, as, fish, and, other, marine, life, rely, on, corals, for, sustenance, and, habitat, communities, that, rely, on, fishing, are, heavily, affected, as, well, as, the, philippine, sea, is, situated, in, a, particularly, active, western, pacific, tropical, cyclone, basin, the, physical, damage, caused, by, typhoons, coming, from, the, east, can, further, destroy, the, marine, habitats, the, first, european, to, navigate, the, philippine, sea, was, ferdinand, magellan, in, 1521, who, named, it, mar, filipinas, when, he, and, his, men, were, in, the, mariana, islands, prior, to, the, exploration, of, the, philippines, later, it, was, discovered, by, other, spanish, explorers, from, 1522, to, 1565, a, historic, battle, between, the, naval, fleets, of, the, united, states, and, japan, took, place, in, the, vicinity, of, the, philippine, sea, this, was, called, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, and, occurred, near, the, mariana, islands, from, 19, to, 20, june, 1944, it, was, also, the, largest, carrier, to, carrier, battle, in, history, which, featured, the, united, states, fifth, fleet, and, the, 1st, mobile, fleet, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, aside, from, the, navy, aerial, activity, was, also, present, in, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, as, hundreds, of, aircraft, from, both, countries, fired, at, each, other, the, americans, indisputably, won, and, nicknamed, the, aerial, war, the, great, marianas, turkey, shoot, due, to, the, number, of, japanese, aircraft, shot, down, japan, struggled, to, recover, from, the, severe, damages, of, its, imperial, navy, and, air, strength, suffered, from, the, battle, this, heavily, attributed, to, the, victory, of, the, united, states, in, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, which, was, a, vital, part, of, the, americans, reclamation, of, the, philippines, and, the, mariana, islands, from, japan, in, 1989, the, united, states, department, of, defense, revealed, the, loss, of, a, one, megaton, nuclear, bomb, in, the, philippine, sea, during, the, 1965, philippine, sea, a, 4, incident, following, an, escalation, of, the, spratly, islands, dispute, in, 2011, various, philippine, government, agencies, started, using, the, designation, west, philippine, sea, to, refer, to, parts, of, the, south, china, sea, however, a, pagasa, spokesperson, said, that, the, sea, east, of, the, philippine, archipelago, will, continue, to, be, called, the, philippine, sea, the, philippines, depends, on, the, philippine, sea, as, one, of, the, sources, of, its, food, and, for, many, people, s, livelihoods, in, the, coral, triangle, area, the, philippines, harvests, seaweeds, milkfish, shrimp, oyster, mussel, and, live, reef, fish, as, aquaculture, products, fishermen, catch, many, types, of, fish, including, small, pelagic, anchovy, sardine, mackerel, and, tuna, among, others, recent, scientific, expeditions, have, found, that, the, benham, rise, also, known, as, the, philippine, rise, in, the, philippine, sea, has, a, diverse, marine, ecosystem, that, attracts, migratory, commercial, fish, like, tuna, marlin, and, mackerel, the, benham, rise, is, a, rich, fishing, ground, for, fishermen, from, aurora, quezon, and, bicol, the, philippines, bureau, of, fisheries, and, aquatic, resources, trains, fishermen, in, sustainable, fishing, techniques, to, prevent, the, destruction, of, coral, formations, which, could, negatively, affect, the, food, chain, that, the, migratory, fish, depend, on, migratory, fish, generally, sell, at, high, prices, for, example, a, single, bluefin, tuna, from, the, benham, rise, can, be, sold, at, market, for, 2, 000, 20, n, 130, e, 20, n, 130, e, 20, 130
