southwestern, boundary, are, largely, temperate, coniferous, forests, of, the, alberta, mountain, forests, and, alberta, british, columbia, foothills, forests, the, southern, quarter, of, the, province, is, prairie, ranging, from, shortgrass, prairie, in, the, southeastern, corner, to, mixed, grass, prairie, in, an, arc, to, the, west, and, north, of, it, the, central, aspen, parkland, region, extending, in, a, broad, arc, between, the, prairies, and, the, forests, from, calgary, north, to, edmonton, and, then, east, to, lloydminster, contains, the, most, fertile, soil, in, the, province, and, most, of, the, population, much, of, the, unforested, part, of, alberta, is, given, over, either, to, grain, farming, or, cattle, ranching, with, mixed, farming, more, common, in, the,

high, temperatures, in, january, range, from, 0, c, 32, f, in, the, southwest, to, 24, c, 11, f, in, the, far, north, the, presence, of, the, rocky, mountains, also, influences, the, climate, to, the, southwest, which, disrupts, the, flow, of, the, prevailing, westerly, winds, and, causes, them, to, drop, most, of, their, moisture, on, the, western, slopes, of, the, mountain, ranges, before, reaching, the, province, casting, a, rain, shadow, over, much, of, alberta, the, northerly, location, and, isolation, from, the, weather, systems, of, the, pacific, ocean, cause, alberta, to, have, a,

climate, the, agricultural, area, of, southern, alberta, has, a, semi, arid, steppe, climate, because, the, annual, precipitation, is, less, than, the, water, that, evaporates, or, is, used, by, plants, the, southeastern, corner, of, alberta, part, of, the, palliser, triangle, experiences, greater, summer, heat, and, lower, rainfall, than, the, rest, of, the, province, and, as, a, result, suffers, frequent, crop, yield, problems, and, occasional, severe, droughts, western, alberta, is, protected, by, the, mountains, and, enjoys, the, mild, temperatures, brought, by, winter, chinook,

the, north, alberta, has, a, humid, continental, climate, with, warm, summers, and, cold, winters, the, province, is, open, to, cold, arctic, weather, systems, from, the, north, which, often, produce, cold, winter, conditions, as, the, fronts, between, the, air, masses, shift, north, and, south, across, alberta, the, temperature, can, change, rapidly, arctic, air, masses, in, the, winter, produce, extreme, minimum, temperatures, varying, from, 54, c, 65, f, in, northern, alberta, to, 46, c, 51, f, in, southern, alberta, although, temperatures, at, these, extremes, are, rare, in, the, summer,

and, western, parts, of, the, province, experience, higher, rainfall, and, lower, evaporation, rates, caused, by, cooler, summer, temperatures, the, south, and, east, central, portions, are, prone, to, drought, like, conditions, sometimes, persisting, for, several, years, although, even, these, areas, can, receive, heavy, precipitation, sometimes, resulting, in, flooding, in, the, winter, the, alberta, clipper, a, type, of, intense, fast, moving, winter, storm, that, generally, forms, over, or, near, the, province, and, pushed, with, great, speed, by, the, continental, polar, jetstream,

edmonton, corridor, is, notable, for, having, the, highest, frequency, of, hail, in, canada, which, is, caused, by, orographic, lifting, from, the, nearby, rocky, mountains, enhancing, the, updraft, downdraft, cycle, necessary, for, the, formation, of, hail, in, central, and, northern, alberta, the, arrival, of, spring, is, marked, by, the, early, flowering, of, the, prairie, crocus, pulsatilla,

formations, the, latter, two, have, a, lower, diversity, of, documented, dinosaurs, primarily, due, to, their, lower, total, fossil, quantity, and, neglect, from, collectors, who, are, hindered, by, the, isolation, and, scarcity, of, exposed, outcrops, their, dinosaur, fossils, are, primarily, teeth, recovered, from, microvertebrate, fossil, sites, additional, geologic, formations, that, have,

others, may, have, migrated, down, the, coast, of, british, columbia, and, then, moved, inland, over, time, they, differentiated, into, various, first, nations, peoples, including, the, plains, indians, of, southern, alberta, such, as, those, of, the, blackfoot, confederacy, and, the, plains, cree, who, generally, lived, by, hunting, buffalo, and, the, more, northerly, tribes, such, as, the, woodland, cree, and, chipewyan, who, hunted, trapped, and, fished, for, a, living, the, first, europeans, to, visit, alberta, were, french, canadians, during, the, late, 18th, century, working, as, fur, traders, french, was, the, predominant, language, used, in, some, early, fur, trading, forts, in, the, region, such, as, the, first, fort, edmonton, in, present, day, fort, saskatchewan, after, the, british, arrival, in, canada, approximately, half, of, the, province, of, alberta, south, of, the, athabasca, river, drainage, became, part, of, rupert, s, land, which, consisted, of, all, land, drained, by, rivers, flowing, into, hudson, bay, this, area, was, granted, by, charles, ii, of, england, to, the, hudson, s, bay, company, hbc, in, 1670, and, rival, fur, trading, companies, were, not, allowed, to, trade, in, it, the, athabasca, river, and, the, rivers, north, of, it, were, not, in, hbc, territory, because, they, drained, into, the, arctic, ocean, instead, of, hudson, bay, and, they, were, prime, habitats, for, fur, bearing, animals, the, first, european, explorer, of, the, athabasca, region, was, peter, pond, who, learned, of, the, methye, portage, which, allowed, travel, from, southern, rivers, into, the, rivers, north, of, rupert, s, land, other, north, american, fur, traders, formed, the, north, west, company, nwc, of, montreal, to, compete, with, the, hbc, in, 1779, the, nwc, occupied, the, northern, part, of, alberta, territory, peter, pond, built, fort, athabasca, on, lac, la, biche, in, 1778, roderick, mackenzie, built, fort, chipewyan, on, lake, athabasca, ten, years, later, in, 1788, his, cousin, sir, alexander, mackenzie, followed, the, north, saskatchewan, river, to, its, northernmost, point, near, edmonton, then, setting, northward, on, foot, trekked, to, the, athabasca, river, which, he, followed, to, lake, athabasca, it, was, there, he, discovered, the, mighty, outflow, river, which, bears, his, name, the, mackenzie, river, which, he, followed, to, its, outlet, in, the, arctic, ocean, returning, to, lake, athabasca, he, followed, the, peace, river, upstream, eventually, reaching, the, pacific, ocean, and, so, he, became, the, first, european, to, cross, the, north, american, continent, north, of, mexico, the, extreme, southernmost, portion, of, alberta, was, part, of, the, french, and, spanish, territory, of, louisiana, and, was, sold, to, the, united, states, in, 1803, in, the, treaty, of, 1818, the, portion, of, louisiana, north, of, the, forty, ninth, parallel, was, ceded, to, great, britain, fur, trade, expanded, in, the, north, but, bloody, battles, occurred, between, the, rival, hbc, and, nwc, and, in, 1821, the, british, government, forced, them, to, merge, to, stop, the, hostilities, the, amalgamated, hudson, s, bay, company, dominated, trade, in, alberta, until, 1870, when, the, newly, formed, canadian, government, purchased, rupert, s, land, northern, alberta, was, included, in, the, north,
