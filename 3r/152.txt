that, flows, roughly, north, to, south, through, the, sea, of, galilee, and, drains, to, the, dead, sea, the, river, passes, by, or, through, jordan, syria, israel, and, the, palestinian, territories, jordan, and, the, israeli, occupied, golan, heights, border, the, river, to, the, east, while, israel, and, the, israeli, occupied, west, bank, lie, to, its, west, both, jordan, and, the, west, bank, derive, their, names, in, relation, to, the, river, the, river, holds, major, significance, in, judaism, and, christianity, according, to, the, bible, the, israelites, crossed, it, into, the, promised, land, and, jesus, of, nazareth, was, baptized, by, john, the, baptist, in, it, several, hypotheses, for, the, origin, of, most, of, the, river, s, names, in, modern, languages, e, g, jordan, yarden, urdunn, one, is, that, it, comes, from, semitic, yard, on, flow, down, reflecting, the, river, s, declivity, possibly, appearing, also, in, other, river, names, in, the, region, such, as, yarkon, and, yarmouk, or, it, may, be, related, to, the, egyptian, loanword, y, or, big, river, the, nile, according, to, this, hypothesis, den, might, be, linked, to, the, akkadian, word, dannum, for, powerful, cognates, of, the, word, are, found, in, aramaic, hebrew, mandaic, and, other, semitic, languages, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, name, appears, as, y, rdon, in, anastasi, i, an, ancient, egyptian, papyrus, that, probably, dates, to, the, time, of, rameses, ii, early, arab, chronicles, referred, to, the, river, as, al, urdunn, in, mandaic, the, etymologically, related, term, yardena, classical, mandaic, can, refer, not, only, to, the, jordan, river, but, also, any, other, body, of, flowing, water, that, can, be, used, for, mandaean, baptismal, rituals, masbuta, after, the, crusades, the, arabic, name, nahr, al, sharieat, arabic, literally, the, watering, place, began, to, be, used, and, was, recorded, by, medieval, geographers, such, as, abu, l, fida, and, al, dimashqi, the, name, was, shown, in, various, forms, on, most, notable, 19th, century, maps, of, the, region, and, is, described, by, edward, robinson, in, his, biblical, researches, in, palestine, although, historical, sources, do, not, appear, to, make, this, distinction, it, is, described, in, some, modern, sources, as, the, name, for, the, part, of, the, river, before, it, flows, into, the, sea, of, galilee, the, dan, and, hasbani, rivers, merge, near, the, kibbutz, sde, nehemia, in, northern, israel, and, become, the, jordan, river, the, hasbani, arabic, hasbani, hebrew, either, snir, or, hatzbani, is, a, stream, which, flows, from, the, north, western, foot, of, mount, hermon, in, lebanon, with, a, flow, of, 118, million, m, 3, annually, the, iyyon, hebrew, iyyon, arabic, name, ajoun, stream, but, dardara, for, the, uppermost, course, and, bareighith, or, beregeith, for, the, rest, of, its, course, is, a, stream, which, flows, from, merj, ayun, area, in, southern, lebanon, into, the, hasbani, the, dan, arabic, leddan, or, liddan, hebrew, dan, is, the, largest, among, the, jordan, s, upper, course, tributaries, with, c, 240, 252, million, cubic, metres, per, year, the, banias, arabic, banias, hebrew, either, banias, or, hermon, is, a, stream, arising, from, a, spring, at, banias, at, the, foot, of, mount, hermon, with, a, flow, of, 106, million, m, 3, annually, it, flows, into, the, dan, along, with, the, nahal, sion, or, nahal, assal, hebrew, wadi, el, asl, or, assal, arabic, the, jordan, river, has, an, upper, course, from, its, sources, to, the, sea, of, galilee, via, the, bethsaida, valley, and, a, lower, course, south, of, the, sea, of, galilee, down, to, the, dead, sea, in, traditional, terminology, the, upper, course, or, most, of, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, passing, through, the, hula, valley, as, opposed, to, upper, jordan, valley, the, sea, of, galilee, through, which, the, river, passes, is, a, separate, entity, and, the, term, jordan, valley, is, reserved, for, the, lower, course, over, its, upper, course, fed, by, the, hasbani, river, banias, river, dan, river, and, the, iyyon, stream, the, river, drops, rapidly, in, a, 75, kilometre, 47, mi, run, to, the, once, large, and, swampy, lake, hula, which, is, slightly, above, sea, level, exiting, the, now, much, diminished, lake, it, goes, through, an, even, steeper, drop, over, the, 25, kilometres, 16, mi, down, to, the, sea, of, galilee, which, it, enters, at, its, northern, end, the, jordan, deposits, much, of, the, silt, it, is, carrying, within, the, lake, which, it, leaves, again, near, its, southern, tip, at, degania, dam, its, section, north, of, the, sea, of, galilee, is, within, the, boundaries, of, israel, and, forms, the, western, boundary, of, the, golan, heights, south, of, the, lake, it, forms, the, border, between, the, kingdom, of, jordan, to, the, east, and, israel, to, the, west, south, of, the, sea, of, galilee, the, river, is, situated, about, 210, metres, below, sea, level, the, last, 120, kilometre, long, 75, mi, section, follows, what, is, commonly, termed, the, jordan, valley, which, has, less, gradient, the, total, drop, is, another, 210, metres, so, that, the, river, meanders, before, entering, the, dead, sea, a, terminal, lake, about, 422, metres, below, sea, level, with, no, outlet, the, river, is, fed, by, two, major, tributaries, the, yarmouk, and, zarqa, the, yarmouk, the, largest, tributary, of, the, lower, course, forms, the, border, between, syria, and, jordan, and, then, jordan, and, israel, smaller, tributaries, or, side, wadis, side, streams, in, this, segment, are, north, to, south, in, the, 19th, century, the, river, jordan, and, the, dead, sea, were, explored, by, boat, primarily, by, christopher, costigan, in, 1835, thomas, howard, molyneux, in, 1847, william, francis, lynch, in, 1848, and, john, macgregor, in, 1869, the, full, text, of, w, f, lynch, s, 1849, book, narrative, of, the, united, states, expedition, to, the, river, jordan, and, the, dead, sea, is, available, online, in, 1964, israel, began, operating, a, pumping, station, that, diverts, water, from, the, sea, of, galilee, to, the, national, water, carrier, also, in, 1964, jordan, constructed, a, channel, that, diverted, water, from, the, yarmouk, to, the, east, ghor, canal, syria, has, also, built, reservoirs, that, catch, the, yarmouk, s, waters, environmentalists, blame, israel, jordan, and, syria, for, extensive, damage, to, the, jordan, river, ecosystem, the, jordan, river, basin, has, a, unique, ichthyofauna, as, it, serves, as, the, meeting, point, for, several, different, biogeographic, regions, including, the, northern, palearctic, the, afrotropics, east, south, asia, and, the, mediterranean, native, fish, include, cyprinids, such, as, the, jordan, bream, achanthobrama, lissneri, jordan, himri, carasobarbus, canis, jordan, barbel, luciobarbus, longiceps, levantine, scraper, capoeta, damascina, the, most, common, native, fish, in, the, basin, red, garra, garra, rufa, damascus, garra, garra, nana, hillstream, loaches, such, as, the, palestine, loach, oxynoemacheilus, insignis, catfish, such, as, the, african, sharptooth, catfish, clarias, gariepinus, cichlids, such, as, the, blue, tilapia, oreochromis, aureus, redbelly, tilapia, coptodon, zillii, mango, tilapia, sarotherodon, galilaeus, and, blennies, such, as, the, freshwater, blenny, salariopsis, fluviatilis, the, jordan, bream, and, jordan, barbel, are, thought, to, be, endemic, to, the, jordan, river, basin, the, jordan, basin, may, have, also, served, as, the, center, of, diversification, for, several, now, widespread, palearctic, fish, groups, a, native, freshwater, reptile, is, the, balkan, terrapin, mauremys, rivulata, which, is, thought, to, have, also, been, a, food, source, for, the, earliest, neanderthal, residents, of, the, region, several, introduced, species, of, fish, are, known, from, the, region, including, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, grass, carp, ctenopharyngodon, idella, black, carp, hypophthalmichthys, molitrix, rainbow, trout, oncorhynchus, mykiss, nile, tilapia, oreochromis, niloticus, and, sea, mullet, mugil, cephalus, many, of, these, introduced, fish, either, prey, on, or, outcompete, native, fish, and, threaten, their, populations, especially, the, more, endangered, species, in, modern, times, up, to, 95, of, the, water, is, diverted, for, human, purposes, and, the, flow, is, less, than, 10, of, the, past, average, because, of, this, and, the, high, evaporation, rate, of, the, dead, sea, as, well, as, industrial, extraction, of, salts, through, evaporation, ponds, the, dead, sea, is, rapidly, shrinking, the, flow, rate, of, the, jordan, river, once, was, 1, 3, billion, cubic, metres, per, year, as, of, 2010, just, 20, to, 30, million, cubic, metres, per, year, flow, into, the, dead, sea, a, small, section, of, the, northernmost, portion, of, the, lower, jordan, the, first, ca, 3, kilometre, 1, 9, mi, below, the, sea, of, galilee, has, been, kept, pristine, for, baptism, and, local, tourism, most, polluted, is, the, 100, kilometre, downstream, stretch, a, meandering, stream, from, above, the, confluence, with, the, yarmouk, to, the, dead, sea, environmentalists, say, the, practice, of, letting, sewage, and, brackish, water, flow, into, the, river, has, almost, destroyed, its, ecosystem, rescuing, the, jordan, could, take, decades, according, to, environmentalists, in, 2007, foeme, named, the, jordan, river, as, one, of, the, world, s, 100, most, endangered, ecological, sites, due, in, part, to, lack, of, cooperation, between, israel, and, neighboring, arab, states, route, 90, part, of, which, is, named, after, rehavam, zeevi, connects, the, northern, and, southern, tips, of, the, israeli, occupied, west, bank, and, parallels, the, jordan, river, on, the, western, side, there, are, two, border, crossings, between, israel, and, jordan, which, cross, the, river, over, bridges, the, northern, one, jordan, river, crossing, or, sheikh, hussein, bridge, is, near, beit, she, an, the, southern, one, allenby, bridge, also, king, hussein, bridge, is, near, jericho, north, to, south, until, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, the, waters, of, the, jordan, river, had, been, the, largest, water, resource, for, israel, lately, desalinated, sea, water, from, the, mediterranean, has, taken, over, this, role, israel, s, national, water, carrier, completed, in, 1964, has, delivered, water, from, the, sea, of, galilee, to, the, israeli, coastal, plain, for, over, four, decades, until, prolonged, drought, led, to, abandoning, this, solution, in, favour, of, desalination, jordan, receives, 50, 000, 000, cubic, metres, 1, 8, 10, 9, cu, ft, of, water, from, the, river, a, quantity, which, is, regulated, by, the, 1994, peace, treaty, with, israel, in, the, past, one, of, the, main, water, resources, in, jordan, was, the, jordan, river, with, a, flow, of, 1, 3, billion, m, 3, per, year, bcm, yr, however, after, israel, built, the, national, water, carrier, in, 1953, and, diverted, water, from, the, sea, of, galilee, to, israel, s, coastal, plains, and, southern, desert, the, flow, of, the, lower, jordan, river, dropped, significantly, the, 50, mcm, yr, that, israel, provides, from, the, sea, of, galilee, as, part, of, the, 1994, peace, treaty, was, meant, to, compensate, for, this, loss, a, 2010, study, found, that, the, lower, jordan, river, has, been, reduced, to, 2, of, its, historic, flow, water, quality, has, also, deteriorated, sharply, with, high, levels, of, salinity, and, pollution, from, agricultural, fertilizer, and, untreated, wastewater, upstream, in, israel, and, the, west, bank, conflict, about, the, waters, of, the, jordan, river, was, a, contributing, factor, to, the, six, day, war, when, starting, in, 1965, syria, attempted, to, divert, some, of, its, headwaters, in, collaboration, with, lebanon, and, jordan, the, diversion, works, would, have, reduced, the, water, availability, for, israel, s, carrier, by, about, 35, and, israel, s, overall, water, supply, by, about, 11, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, jordan, is, referred, to, as, the, source, of, fertility, of, a, large, plain, kikkar, ha, yarden, said, to, be, watered, like, the, garden, of, the, lord, genesis, 13, 10, there, is, no, regular, description, of, the, jordan, in, the, bible, only, scattered, and, indefinite, references, to, it, are, given, jacob, crossed, it, and, its, tributary, the, jabbok, the, modern, zarqa, river, on, his, way, back, from, haran, genesis, 32, 11, 32, 23, 24, it, is, noted, as, the, line, of, demarcation, between, the, two, tribes, and,

region, biblical, commentator, albert, barnes, suggests, that, trees, were, rare, in, most, parts, of, palestine, but, plentiful, in, the, jordan, valley, in, biblical, history, the, jordan, appears, as, the, scene, of, several, miracles, the, first, taking, place, when, the, jordan, near, jericho, was, crossed, by, the, israelites, under, joshua, joshua, 3, 15, 17, later, the, two, tribes, and, the, half, tribe, that, settled, east, of, the, jordan, built, a, large, altar, on, its, banks, as, a, witness, between, them, and, the, other, tribes, joshua, 22, 10, 22, 26, et, seq, the, jordan,

jesus, and, a, place, of, pilgrimage, this, has, led, to, choosing, al, maghtas, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2015, because, according, to, jewish, tradition, the, israelites, made, a, difficult, and, hazardous, journey, from, slavery, in, egypt, to, freedom, in, the, promised, land, the, jordan, can, refer, to, freedom, the, actual, crossing, is, the, final, step, of, the, journey,
