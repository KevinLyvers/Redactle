their, kings, finally, succeeded, in, capturing, the, lakhmid, capital, of, al, irah, in, southern, modern, day, iraq, later, however, in, about, 529, al, mundhir, recaptured, the, city, and, put, king, rith, and, about, fifty, members, of, his, family, to, death, in, 525, the, aksumites, invaded, imyar, and, this, had, a, knock, on, effect, with, the, kindites, who, lost, the, support, of, the, imyarites, within, three, years, the, kindite, kingdom, had, split, into, four, groups, asad, taghlib, qays, and, kin, nah, each, led, by, a, prince, of, kindah, these, small, principalities, were, then, overthrown, in, the, 530s, and, 540s, in, a, series, of, uprisings, of, the, adn, n, tribes, of, najd, and, ij, z, in, 540, the, lakhmids, destroyed, all, the, kindite, settlements, in,

expeditions, in, the, area, the, first, was, the, nejd, caravan, raid, against, the, quraysh, which, took, place, in, 624, the, meccans, led, by, safwan, ibn, umayyah, who, lived, on, trade, left, in, summer, for, syria, for, their, seasonal, trade, business, after, muhammad, received, intelligence, about, the, caravan, s, route, he, ordered, zayd, ibn, haritha, to, go, after, the, caravan, and, they, successfully, raided, it, and, captured, 100, 000, dirhams, worth, of, booty, the, invasion, of, nejd, happened, in, rabi, ath, thani, or, jumada, al, awwal, 4, ah, october, 625, ad, muhammad, led, his, fighters, to, nejd, to, scare, off, some, tribes, whose, intentions, were, suspicious, some, scholars, say, the, expedition, of, dhat, al, riqa, took, place, in, nejd, as, part, of, this, invasion, the, most, authentic, opinion, according, to, saifur, rahman, al, mubararakpuri, however, is, that, the, dhat, ar, riqa, campaign, took, place, after, the, fall, of, khaibar, and, not, as, part, of, the, invasion, of, nejd, this, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, abu, hurairah, and, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, witnessed, the, battle, abu, hurairah, embraced, islam, only, some, days, before, khaibar, and, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, came, back, from, abyssinia, modern, day, ethiopia, and, joined, muhammad, at, khaibar, the, rules, relating, to, the, prayer, of, fear, which, muhammad, observed, at, the, dhat, ar, riqa, campaign, were, revealed, at, the, asfan, invasion, and, these, scholars, say, took, place, after, al, khandaq, the, expedition, of, qatan, also, took, place, in, nejd, the, banu, asad, ibn, khuzaymah, tribe, not, to, be, confused, with, the, banu, asad, tribe, was, a, powerful, tribe, connected, with, the, quraysh, they, resided, near, the, hill, of, katan, in, the, vicinity, of, fayd, in, nejd, muhammad, received, intelligence, reports, that, they, were, planning, a, raid, on, medina, so, he, dispatched, a, force, of, 150, men, under, the, leadership, of, abu, salama, abd, allah, ibn, abd, al, asad, to, make, a, sudden, attack, on, this, tribe, after, muhammad, s, death, previously, dormant, tensions, between, the, meccan, immigrants, the, muhajirun, and, the, medinan, converts, the, ansar, threatened, to, split, the, ummah, other, arabian, tribes, also, wished, to, revert, from, islam, to, local, leadership, and, split, from, medina, s, control, in, some, places, people, such, as, al, aswad, al, ansi, and, musaylima, claimed, prophethood, and, started, to, establish, leaderships, in, opposition, to, medina, the, ansar, the, leaders, of, the, tribes, of, medina, met, in, a, hall, or, house, called, saqifah, to, discuss, whom, they, would, support, as, their, new, leader, when, abu, bakr, was, informed, of, the, meeting, he, umar, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, and, a, few, others, rushed, to, prevent, the, ansar, from, making, a, premature, decision, during, the, meeting, umar, declared, that, abu, bakr, should, be, the, new, leader, and, declared, his, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, followed, by, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, and, thus, abu, bakr, became, the, first, caliph, apostasy, and, rebellion, in, central, arabia, were, led, by, musaylima, in, the, fertile, region, of, yamamah, he, was, mainly, supported, by, the, powerful, tribe, of, banu, hanifa, at, buzakha, in, north, central, arabia, another,

ibn, nuweira, led, the, tribes, of, banu, tamim, against, the, authority, of, medina, on, receiving, intelligence, of, the, muslims, preparations, tulayha, too, prepared, for, a, battle, and, was, further, reinforced, by, the, contingents, of, the, allied, tribes, before, launching, khalid, ibn, al, walid, against, tulayha, abu, bakr, sought, ways, and, means, of, reducing, the, latter, s, strength, so, that, the, battle, could, be, fought, with, the, maximum, prospects, of, victory, nothing, could, be, done, about, the, tribes, of, banu, asad, and, banu, ghatafan, which, stood, solidly, behind, tulayha, but, the, tayy, were, not, so, staunch, in, their, support, of, tulayha, and, their, chief, adi, ibn, hatim, was, a, devout, muslim, adi, was, appointed, by, abu, bakr, to, negotiate, with, the, tribal, elders, to, withdraw, their, contingent, from, tulayha, s, army, the, negotiations, were, a, success, and, adi, brought, with, him, 500, horsemen, of, his, tribe, to,

the, battle, of, zafar, afterwards, he, moved, to, najd, against, the, rebel, tribe, of, banu, tamim, and, their, sheikh, malik, ibn, nuwayrah, at, najd, getting, the, news, of, khalid, s, decisive, victories, against, apostates, in, buzakha, many, clans, of, banu, tamim, hastened, to, visit, khalid, but, the, banu, yarbu, a, branch, of, banu, tamim, under, their, chief, malik, ibn, nuwayrah, hung, back, malik, was, a, chief, of, some, distinction, a, warrior, noted, for, his, generosity, and, a, famous, poet, bravery, generosity, and, poetry, were, the, three, qualities, most, admired, among, the, arabs, at, the, time, of, muhammad, he, had, been, appointed, as, a, tax, collector, for, the, tribe, of, banu, tamim, as, soon, as, malik, heard, of, the, death, of, muhammad, he, gave, back, all, the, tax, to, his, tribespeople, saying, now, you, are, the, owner, of, your, wealth, moreover, he, was, to, be, charged, because, he, signed, a, pact, with, the, anti, islamic, prophet, sajjah, this, agreement, stated, that, first, they, would, deal, with, local, enemy, tribes, together, and, then, they, would, confront, the, state, of, madinah, his, riders, were, stopped, by, khalid, s, army, at, the, town, of, buttah, khalid, asked, them, about, the, signing, of, pact, with, sajjah, they, said, it, was, just, because, they, wanted, revenge, against, their, terrible, enemies, when, khalid, reached, najd, he, found, no, opposing, army, he, sent, his, cavalry, to, nearby, villages, and, ordered, them, to, call, the, athaan, to, each, party, they, meet, zirrar, bin,

instructed, to, make, contact, with, musaylima, at, yamamah, but, not, to, engage, in, fighting, until, khalid, joined, him, abu, bakr, s, intention, in, giving, ikrimah, this, mission, was, to, tie, musaylima, down, at, yamamah, with, ikrimah, on, the, horizon, musaylima, would, remain, in, expectation, of, a, muslim, attack, and, thus, not, be, able, to, leave, his, base, with, musaylima, so, committed, khalid, would, be, free, to, deal, with, the, apostate, tribes, of, north, central, arabia, without, interference, from, yamamah, meanwhile, abu, bakr, sent, shurhabil, s, corps, to, reinforce, ikrama, at, yamamah, however, ikrimah, attacked, musaylima, s, forces, in, early, september, 632, and, was, defeated, he, wrote, the, details, of, his, actions, to, abu, bakr, who, both, pained, and, angered, by, the, rashness, of, ikrimah, and, his, disobedience, ordered, him, to, proceed, with, his, force, to, oman, to, assist, hudaifa, once, hudaifa, had, completed, his, task, to,

region, around, yamamah, and, to, kill, or, capture, all, who, resisted, thereafter, all, of, central, arabia, submitted, to, medina, what, remained, of, the, apostasy, in, the, less, vital, areas, of, arabia, was, rooted, out, by, the, muslims, in, a, series, of, well, planned, campaigns, within, five, months, muhammad, s, followers, rapidly, expanded, the, territory, under, muslim, rule, beyond, arabia, conquering, huge, swathes, of, territory, from, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, west, to, modern, day, pakistan, in, the, east, in, a, matter, of, decades, the, bulk, of, the, tribes, that, helped, the, caliphate, s, expansion, into, persia, and, the, levant, were, composed, of, najdi, tribes, such, as, banu, tamim, the, caliphate, s, use, of, these, once, rebellious, tribes, allowed, abu, bakr, and, umar, to, quickly, deploy, battle, hardened, men, and, experienced, generals, such, as, al, qa, qa, ibn, amr, al, tamimi, into, the, front, lines, against, the, persians, and, byzantines, najd, soon, became, a, politically, peripheral, region, of, the, muslim, world, as, the, focus, shifted, to, the, outside, of, the, peninsula, many, of, members, of, the, conquering, tribes, of, najd, soon, shifted, into, the, levant, persia, and, north, africa, playing, a, role, in, future, conflicts, in, the, caliphate, becoming, governors, and, even, birthing, emirates, such, as, the, aghlabids, migrations, continued, throughout, the, centuries, back, and, forth, from, nejd, to, iraq, and, the, levant, with, many, najdi, tribes, reaching, khorosan, and, the, maghreb, in, the, 16th, century, the, ottomans, added, the, red, sea, and, persian, gulf, coast, the, hejaz, asir, and, al, ahsa, to, the, empire, and, claimed, suzerainty, over, the, interior, one, reason, was, to, thwart, portuguese, attempts, to, attack, the, red, sea, hence, the, hejaz, and, the, indian, ocean, ottoman, control, over, these, lands, varied, over, the, next, four, centuries, with, the, fluctuating, strength, or, weakness, of, the, empire, s, central, authority, the, emergence, of, what, was, to, become, the, saudi, royal, family, known, as, the, al, saud, began, in, najd, in, central, arabia, in, 1744, when, muhammad, bin, saud, founder, of, the, dynasty, joined, forces, with, the, religious, leader, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, founder, of, the, wahhabi, movement, a, strict, puritanical, form, of, sunni, islam, this, alliance, formed, in, the, 18th, century, provided, the, ideological, impetus, to, saudi, expansion, and, remains, the, basis, of, saudi, arabian, dynastic, rule, today, the, first, saudi, state, established, in, 1744, in, the, area, around, riyadh, rapidly, expanded, and, briefly, controlled, most, of, the, present, day, territory, of, saudi, arabia, but, was, destroyed, by, 1818, by, the, ottoman, viceroy, of, egypt, mohammed, ali, pasha, a, much, smaller, second, saudi, state, located, mainly, in, nejd, was, established, in, 1824, by, turki, bn, abdullah, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 19th, century, the, al, saud, contested, control, of, the, interior, of, what, was, to, become, saudi, arabia, with, another, arabian, ruling, family, the, al, rashid, by, 1891, the, al, rashid, were, victorious, and, the, al, saud, were, driven, into, exile, in, kuwait, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, ottoman, empire, continued, to, control, or, have, suzerainty, over, most, of, the, peninsula, subject, to, this, suzerainty, arabia, was, ruled, by, a, patchwork, of, tribal, rulers, with, the, sharif, of, mecca, having, pre, eminence, and, ruling, the, hejaz, in, 1902, abdul, rahman, s, son, abdulaziz, later, to, be, known, to, the, west, as, ibn, saud, recaptured, control, of, riyadh, bringing, the, al, saud, back, to, najd, ibn, saud, gained, the, support, of, the, ikhwan, a, tribal, army, inspired, by, wahhabism, and, which, had, grown, quickly, after, its, foundation, in, 1912, with, the, aid, of, the, ikhwan, ibn, saud, captured, al, ahsa, from, the, ottomans, in, 1913, in, 1916, with, the, encouragement, and, support, of, britain, which, was, fighting, the, ottomans, in, world, war, i, the, sharif, of, mecca, hussein, bin, ali, led, a, pan, arab, revolt, against, the, ottoman, empire, to, create, a, united, arab, state, although, this, revolt, failed, in, its, objective, the, allied, victory, in, world, war, i, resulted, in, the, end, of, ottoman, suzerainty, and, control, in, arabia, ibn, saud, avoided, involvement, in, the, arab, revolt, and, instead, continued, his, struggle, with, the, al, rashid, following, the, latter, s, final, defeat, he, took, the, title, sultan, of, najd, in, 1921, with, the, help, of, the, ikhwan, the, hejaz, was, conquered, in, 1924, 25, and, on, 10, january, 1926, ibn, saud, declared, himself, king, of, the, hejaz, a, year, later, he, added, the, title, of, king, of, nejd, for, the, next, five, years, he, administered, the, two, parts, of, his, dual, kingdom, as, separate, units, after, the, conquest, of, the, hejaz, the, ikhwan, leadership, turned, to, expansion, of, the, wahhabist, realm, into, the, british, protectorates, of, transjordan, iraq, and, kuwait, and, began, raiding, those, territories, this, met, with, ibn, saud, s, opposition, as, he, recognized, the, danger, of, a, direct, conflict, with, the, british, at, the, same, time, the, ikhwan, became, disenchanted, with, ibn, saud, s, domestic, policies, which, appeared, to, favor, modernization, and, the, increase, in, the, number, of, non, muslim, foreigners, in, the, country, as, a, result, they, turned, against, ibn, saud, and, after, a, two, year, struggle, were, defeated, in, 1930, at, the, battle, of, sabilla, where, their, leaders, were, massacred, in, 1932, the, two, kingdoms, of, the, hejaz, and, nejd, were, united, as, the, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, the, arabic, word, najd, literally, means, upland, and, was, once, applied, to, a, variety, of, regions, within, the, arabian, peninsula, however, the, most, famous, of, these, in, recent, times, was, the, central, region, of, the, peninsula, roughly, bounded, on, the, west, by, the, mountains, of, the, hejaz, and, yemen, and, to, the, east, by, the, historical, region, of, eastern, arabia, and, the, north, by, iraq, and, syria, medieval, muslim, geographers, spent, a, great, amount, of, time, debating, the, exact, boundaries, between, hejaz, and, najd, in, particular, but, generally, set, the, western, boundaries, of, najd, to, be, wherever, the, western, mountain, ranges, and, lava, beds, began, to, slope, eastwards, and, set, the, eastern, boundaries, of, najd, at, the, narrow, strip, of, red, sand, dunes, known, as, the, ad, dahna, desert, some, 100, km, 62, mi, east, of, modern, day, riyadh, the, southern, border, of, najd, has, always, been, set, at, the, large, sea, of, sand, dunes, known, today, as, rub, al, khali, the, empty, quarter, while, the, southwestern, boundaries, are, marked, by, the, valleys, of, wadi, ranyah, wadi, bisha, and, wadi, tathlith, the, northern, boundaries, of, najd, have, fluctuated, greatly, over, time, and, received, far, less, attention, from, the, medieval, geographers, in, the, early, islamic, centuries, najd, was, considered, to, extend, as, far, north, as, the, river, euphrates, or, more, specifically, the, walls, of, khosrau, constructed, by, the, sassanid, empire, as, a, barrier, between, arabia, and, iraq, immediately, prior, to, the, advent, of, islam, the, modern, usage, of, the, term, encompasses, the, region, of, al, yamama, which, was, not, always, considered, part, of, najd, historically, and, became, incorporated, into, the, larger, definition, of, najd, in, the, past, centuries, najd, is, a, plateau, ranging, from, 762, to, 1, 525, m, 2, 500, to, 5, 003, ft, in, height, and, sloping, downwards, from, west, to, east, the, eastern, sections, historically, better, known, as, al, yamama, are, marked, by, oasis, settlements, with, much, farming, and, trading, activities, while, the, rest, has, traditionally, been, sparsely, occupied, by, nomadic, bedouins, the, main, topographical, features, include, the, twin, mountains, of, aja, and, salma, in, the, north, near, ha, il, the, high, land, of, jabal, shammar, and, the, tuwaiq, mountain, range, running, through, its, center, from, north, to, south, also, important, are, the, various, dry, river, beds, wadis, such, as, wadi, hanifa, near, riyadh, wadi, na, am, in, the, south, wadi, al, rumah, in, the, al, qassim, province, in, the, north, and, wadi, ad, dawasir, at, the, southernmost, tip, of, najd, on, the, border, with, najran, most, najdi, villages, and, settlements, are, located, along, these, wadis, due, to, ability, of, these, wadis, to, preserve, precious, rainwater, in, the, arid, desert, climate, while, others, are, located, near, oases, historically, najd, itself, has, been, divided, into, small, provinces, made, up, of, constellations, of, small, towns, villages, and, settlements, with, each, one, usually, centered, on, one, capital, these, subdivisions, are, still, recognized, by, najdis, today, as, each, province, retains, its, own, variation, of, the, najdi, dialect, and, najdi, customs, the, most, prominent, among, these, provinces, are, al, aridh, which, includes, riyadh, and, the, historical, saudi, capital, of, diriyah, al, qassim, with, its, capital, in, buraidah, sudair, centered, on, al, majma, ah, al, washm, centered, on, shaqra, and, jebel, shammar, with, its, capital, ha, il, under, modern, day, saudi, arabia, however, najd, is, divided, into, three, administrative, regions, ha, il, al, qassim, and, riyadh, comprising, a, combined, area, of, 554, 000, km, 2, 214, 000, sq, mi, riyadh, is, the, largest, city, in, najd, as, well, as, the, largest, city, in, the, country, as, a, whole, with, a, population, of, more, than, 7, 676, 654, as, of, 2018, other, cities, include, a, il, 936, 465, in, 2021, buraidah, 745, 353, in, 2021, unaizah, 163, 729, in, 2010, and, ar, rass, 133, 000, in, 2010, smaller, towns, and,

the, southernmost, settlement, in, najd, before, the, modern, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, was, formed, the, native, population, in, that, area, was, largely, made, up, of, tribal, arabs, some, of, them, were, part, of, the, majority, class, of, sedentary, farmers, and, merchants, who, lived, in, villages, and, towns, dotted, around, central, arabia, others, a, minority, of, inhabitants, were, nomads, bedouins, who, roamed, between, the, towns, and, villages, of, najd, much, like, hejaz, the, rest, of, the, population, consisted, mainly, of, arabs, who, were, unaffiliated, with, any, tribes, most, of, these, lived, in, the, towns, and, villages, of, najd, and, worked, in, various, trades, such, as, carpentry, or, as, sonnaa, craftsmen, the, population, also, included, a, small, number, of, african, eastern, european, and, south, eastern, european, slaves, and, freedmen, most, of, the, najdi, tribes, are, of, adnanite, origin, their, members, emigrated, to, najd, from, northern, arabia, tihamah, and, hijaz, in, ancient, times, the, most, famous, najdi, tribes, in, the, pre, islamic, era, were, banu, hanifa, in, the, area, around, modern, day, riyadh, banu, tamim, situated, further, north, banu, abs, centered, in, al, qassim, tayy, centered, in, modern, day, ha, il, and, banu, amir, in, southern, najd, during, the, 15th, through, the, 18th, centuries, there, was, a, considerable, tribal, influx, from, the, west, increasing, both, the, nomadic, and, settled, population, of, the, area, and, providing, a, fertile, social, environment, for, the, wahhabi, movement, by, the, 20th, century, many, of, the, ancient, tribes, had, morphed, into, new, confederations, or, had, emigrated, from, other, areas, of, the, middle, east, and, many, tribes, from, other, regions, of, the, peninsula, had, moved, into, najd, however, the, largest, proportion, of, native, najdis, today, still, belong, to, these, ancient, najdi, tribes, or, to, their, newer, incarnations, many, of, the, najdi, tribes, even, in, ancient, times, were, not, nomadic, or, bedouin, but, long, settled, farmers, and, merchants, the, royal, family, of, saudi, arabia, al, saud, for, example, trace, their, lineage, to, banu, hanifa, on, the, eve, of, saudi, arabia, s, formation, the, major, nomadic, tribes, of, najd, included, dawasir, mutayr, utaybah, shammar, historically, known, as, tayy, subay, suhool, harb, and, the, qahtanites, in, southern, najd, many, members, of, the, sedentary, population, belonged, to, tribes, such, as, anizzah, banu, tamim, banu, hanifa, banu, khalid, banu, zayd, banu, lam, dawasir, subay, shammar, and, bahila, most, of, the, minority, nomadic, tribes, are, now, settled, either, in, cities, such, as, riyadh, or, in, special, settlements, known, as, hijras, that, were, established, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, as, part, of, a, country, wide, policy, undertaken, by, king, abdul, aziz, to, put, an, end, to, the, nomadic, way, of, life, nomads, still, exist, in, the, kingdom, however, in, very, small, numbers, a, far, cry, from, the, days, when, they, made, up, the, majority, in, the, arabian, peninsula, since, the, formation, of, modern, saudi, arabia, najd, and, particularly, the, capital, riyadh, has, seen, an, influx, of, immigrants, from, all, regions, of, the, country, and, from, virtually, every, social, class, much, of, the, native, najdi, population, has, also, moved, away, from, its, native, towns, and, villages, to, riyadh, however, most, of, these, villages, still, retain, a, small, number, of, their, native, inhabitants, about, a, quarter, of, the, population, of, najd, including, about, a, third, of, the, population, of, riyadh, are, non, saudi, expatriates, including, both, skilled, professionals, and, unskilled, laborers, slavery, was, abolished, in, saudi, arabia, by, king, faisal, in, 1962, some, of, those, who, were, freed, chose, to, continue, working, for, their, former, owners, particularly, if, those, former, owners, were, members, of, the, royal, family, unlike, the, hejaz, and, tihamah, najd, is, remote, and, stayed, outside, of, the, realm, of, important, islamic, empires, such, as, the, abbasids, and, the, ottoman, empire, this, historical, separation, largely, shaped, its, current, dissimilarity, to, hejaz, the, region, is, traditionally, known, as, a, hanbali, stronghold, and, after, the, 18th, century, became, known, for, its, strict, interpretation, of, islam, and, is, generally, considered, a, bastion, of, religious, conservatism, the, founder, of, the, interpretation, of, salafism, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, born, in, uyayna, a, village, in, the, najd, the, majority, of, people, in, the, region, consider, themselves, as, salafi, muslims, the, name, derives, from, advocating, a, return, to, the, traditions, of, the, ancestors, salaf, the, first, three, generations, of, muslims, said, to, know, the, purest, form, of, islam, those, generations, include, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, his, companions, the, sahabah, their, successors, the, tabi, un, and, the, successors, of, the, successors, the, taba, al, tabi, in, practically, salafis, maintain, that, muslims, ought, to, rely, on, the, qur, an, the, sunnah, and, the, ijma, consensus, of, the, salaf, giving, them, precedence, over, later, islamic, hermeneutic, teachings, the, hadith, of, najd, is, a, hadith, in, sahih, bukhari, with, several, chains, of, narration, about, najd, which, is, prophesied, to, be, the, source, of, calamities, sunni, muslims, accept, that, the, classification, of, the, hadith, as, sahih, authentic, according, to, two, narrations, in, sahih, bukhari, muhammad, asks, allah, to, bless, the, areas, of, bilad, al, sham, syria, and, yemen, when, his, companions, said, our, najd, as, well, he, replied, there, will, appear, earthquakes, and, afflictions, and, from, there, will, come, out, the, side, of, the, head, i, e, horns, of, satan, in, a, similar, narration, muhammad, again, asked, allah, to, bless, the, areas, medina, mecca, sham, and, yemen, and, when, asked, specifically, to, bless, najd, repeated, similar, comments, about, there, being, earthquakes, trials, tribulations, and, the, horns, of, satan, o, allaah, bestow, your, blessings, on, our, shaam, o, allaah, bestow, your, blessings, on, our, yemen, the, people, said, o, messenger, of, allaah, and, our, najd, i, think, the, third, time, the, prophet, sallallaahu, alayhi, wa, sallam, said, there, in, najd, will, occur, earthquakes, trials, and, tribulations, and, from, there, appears, the, horn, of, satan, the, people, of, najd, have, spoken, arabic, in, one, form, or, another, for, practically, all, of, recorded, history, as, in, other, regions, of, the, peninsula, there, is, a, divergence, between, the, dialect, of, the, nomadic, bedouins, and, the, dialect, of, the, sedentary, townspeople, the, variation, however, is, far, less, pronounced, in, najd, than, it, is, elsewhere, in, the, country, and, the, najdi, sedentary, dialect, may, be, either, a, descended, from, the, bedouin, dialect, or, due, to, similar, conditions, of, isolation, from, foreign, influence, they, share, similar, isolated, features, being, related, dialects, the, najdi, dialect, is, seen, by, some, to, be, the, least, foreign, influenced, of, all, modern, arabic, dialects, due, to, the, isolated, location, and, harsh, climate, of, the, najdi, plateau, as, well, as, the, apparent, absence, of, any, substratum, from, a, previous, language, indeed, not, even, the, ancient, south, arabian, language, appears, to, have, been, widely, spoken, in, najd, in, ancient, times, unlike, southern, saudi, arabia, for, example, within, najd, itself, the, different, regions, and, towns, have, their, own, distinctive, accents, and, sub, dialects, however, these, have, largely, merged, in, recent, times, and, have, become, heavily, influenced, by, arabic, dialects, from, other, regions, and, countries, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, riyadh, in, the, early, 20th, century, najd, produced, coarse, wool, cloth,
