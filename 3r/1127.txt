was, 176, the, fear, of, austin, s, proximity, to, the, indians, and, mexico, which, still, considered, texas, a, part, of, their, land, created, an, immense, motive, for, sam, houston, the, first, and, third, president, of, the, republic, of, texas, to, relocate, the, capital, once, again, in, 1841, upon, threats, of, mexican, troops, in, texas, houston, raided, the, land, office, to, transfer,

dramatically, after, the, enforcement, of, the, emancipation, proclamation, in, texas, by, union, general, gordon, granger, at, galveston, in, an, event, commemorated, as, juneteenth, black, communities, such, as, wheatville, pleasant, hill, and, clarksville, were, established, with, clarksville, being, the, oldest, surviving, freedomtown, the, original, post, civil, war, settlements, founded, by, former, african, american, slaves, west, of, the, mississippi, river, in, 1870, blacks, made, up, 36, 5, of, austin, s, population, the, postwar, period, saw, dramatic, population, and, economic, growth, the, opening, of, the, houston, and, texas, central, railway, h, tc, in, 1871, turned, austin, into, the, major, trading, center, for, the, region, with, the, ability, to, transport, both, cotton, and, cattle, the, missouri, kansas, texas, mkt, line, followed, close, behind, austin, was, also, the, terminus, of, the, southernmost, leg, of, the, chisholm, trail, and, drovers, pushed, cattle, north, to, the, railroad, cotton, was, one, of, the, few, crops, produced, locally, for, export, and, a, cotton, gin, engine, was, located, downtown, near, the, trains, for, ginning, cotton, of, its, seeds, and, turning, the, product, into, bales, for, shipment, however, as, other, new, railroads, were, built, through, the, region, in, the, 1870s, austin, began, to, lose, its, primacy, in, trade, to, the, surrounding, communities, in, addition, the, areas, east, of, austin, took, over, cattle, and, cotton, production, from, austin, especially, in, towns, like, hutto, and, taylor, that, sit, over, the, blackland, prairie, with, its, deep, rich, soils, for, producing, cotton, and, hay, in, september, 1881, austin, public, schools, held, their, first, classes, the, same,

in, 1888, and, claimed, as, the, seventh, largest, building, in, the, world, in, the, late, 19th, century, austin, expanded, its, city, limits, to, more, than, three, times, its, former, area, and, the, first, granite, dam, was, built, on, the, colorado, river, to, power, a, new, street, car, line, and, the, new, moon, towers, the, first, dam, washed, away, in, a, flood, on, april, 7, 1900, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, austin, implemented, the, 1928, austin, city, plan, through, a, series, of, civic, development, and, beautification, projects, that, created, much, of, the, city, s, infrastructure, and, many, of, its, parks, in, addition, the, state, legislature, established, the, lower, colorado, river, authority, lcra, that, along, with, the, city, of, austin, created, the, system, of, dams, along, the, colorado, river, to, form, the, highland, lakes, these, projects, were, enabled, in, large, part, because, the, public, works, administration, provided, austin, with, greater, funding, for, municipal, construction, projects, than, other, texas, cities, during, the, early, 20th, century, a, three, way, system, of, social, segregation, emerged, in, austin, with, anglos, african, americans, and, mexicans, being, separated, by, custom, or, law, in, most, aspects, of, life, including, housing, health, care, and, education, deed, restrictions, also, played, an, important, role, in, residential, segregation, after, 1935, most, housing, deeds, prohibited, african, americans, and, sometimes, other, nonwhite, groups, from, using, land, combined, with, the, system, of, segregated, public, services, racial, segregation, increased, in, austin, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, with, african, americans, and, mexicans, experiencing, high, levels, of, discrimination, and, social, marginalization, in, 1940, the, destroyed, granite, dam, on, the, colorado, river, was, finally, replaced, by, a, hollow, concrete, dam, that, formed, lake, mcdonald, now, called, lake, austin, and, which, has, withstood, all, floods, since, in, addition, the, much, larger, mansfield, dam, was, built, by, the, lcra, upstream, of, austin, to, form, lake, travis, a, flood, control, reservoir, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, texas, oil, boom, took, hold, creating, tremendous, economic, opportunities, in, southeast, texas, and, north, texas, the, growth, generated, by, this, boom, largely, passed, by, austin, at, first, with, the, city, slipping, from, fourth, largest, to, tenth, largest, in, texas, between, 1880, and, 1920, after, a, severe, lull, in, economic, growth, from, the, great, depression, austin, resumed, its, steady, development, following, the, mid, 20th, century, austin, became, established, as, one, of, texas, major,

in, the, national, music, scene, with, local, artists, such, as, willie, nelson, asleep, at, the, wheel, and, stevie, ray, vaughan, and, iconic, music, venues, such, as, the, armadillo, world,
