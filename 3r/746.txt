iron, age, celtic, cultures, some, historians, such, as, john, t, koch, consider, wales, in, the, late, bronze, age, as, part, of, a, maritime, trading, networked, culture, that, included, other, celtic, nations, this, atlantic, celtic, view, is, opposed, by, others, who, hold, that, the, celtic, languages, derive, their, origins, from, the, more, easterly, hallstatt, culture, by, the, time, of, the, roman, invasion, of, britain, the, area, of, modern, wales, had, been, divided, among, the, tribes, of, the, deceangli, north, east, ordovices, north, west, demetae, south, west, silures, south, east, and, cornovii, east, the, roman, conquest, of, wales, began, in, ad, 48, and, took, 30, years, to, complete, the, occupation, lasted, over, 300, years, the, campaigns, of, conquest, were, opposed, by, two, native, tribes, the, silures, and, the, ordovices, caractacus, or, caradog, leader, of, the, ordovices, had, initial, success, in, resisting, roman, invasions, of, north, wales, but, was, eventually, defeated, roman, rule, in, wales, was, a, military, occupation, save, for, the, southern, coastal, region, of, south, wales, where, there, is, a, legacy, of, romanisation, the, only, town, in, wales, founded, by, the, romans, caerwent, is, in, south, east, wales, both, caerwent, and, carmarthen, also, in, southern, wales, became, roman, civitates, wales, had, a, rich, mineral, wealth, the, romans, used, their, engineering, technology, to, extract, large, amounts, of, gold, copper, and, lead, as, well, as, lesser, amounts, of, zinc, and, silver, no, significant, industries, were, located, in, wales, in, this, time, this, was, largely, a, matter, of, circumstance, as, wales, had, none, of, the, necessary, materials, in, suitable, combination, and, the, forested, mountainous, countryside, was, not, amenable, to, industrialisation, latin, became, the, official, language, of, wales, though, the, people, continued, to, speak, in, brythonic, while, romanisation, was, far, from, complete, the, upper, classes, came, to, consider, themselves, roman, particularly, after, the, ruling, of, 212, that, granted, roman, citizenship, to, all, free, men, throughout, the, empire, further, roman, influence, came, through, the, spread, of, christianity, which, gained, many, followers, when, christians, were, allowed, to, worship, freely, state, persecution, ceased, in, the, 4th, century, as, a, result, of, constantine, the, great, issuing, an, edict, of, toleration, in, 313, early, historians, including, the, 6th, century, cleric, gildas, have, noted, 383, as, a, significant, point, in, welsh, history, in, that, year, the, roman, general, magnus, maximus, or, macsen, wledig, stripped, britain, of, troops, to, launch, a, successful, bid, for, imperial, power, continuing, to, rule, britain, from, gaul, as, emperor, and, transferring, power, to, local, leaders, the, earliest, welsh, genealogies, cite, maximus, as, the, founder, of, several, royal, dynasties, and, as, the, father, of, the, welsh, nation, he, is, given, as, the, ancestor, of, a, welsh, king, on, the, pillar, of, eliseg, erected, nearly, 500, years, after, he, left, britain, and, he, figures, in, lists, of, the, fifteen, tribes, of, wales, the, 400, year, period, following, the, collapse, of, roman, rule, is, the, most, difficult, to, interpret, in, the, history, of, wales, after, the, roman, departure, in, ad, 410, much, of, the, lowlands, of, britain, to, the, east, and, south, east, was, overrun, by, various, germanic, peoples, commonly, known, as, anglo, saxons, some, have, theorized, that, the, cultural, dominance, of, the, anglo, saxons, was, due, to, apartheid, like, social, conditions, in, which, the, britons, were, at, a, disadvantage, by, ad, 500, the, land, that, would, become, wales, had, divided, into, a, number, of, kingdoms, free, from, anglo, saxon, rule, the, kingdoms, of, gwynedd, powys, dyfed, caredigion, morgannwg, the, ystrad, tywi, and, gwent, emerged, as, independent, welsh, successor, states, archaeological, evidence, in, the, low, countries, and, what, was, to, become, england, shows, early, anglo, saxon, migration, to, great, britain, reversed, between, 500, and, 550, which, concurs, with, frankish, chronicles, john, davies, notes, this, as, consistent, with, a, victory, for, the, celtic, britons, at, badon, hill, against, the, saxons, which, was, attributed, to, arthur, by, nennius, having, lost, much, of, what, is, now, the, west, midlands, to, mercia, in, the, 6th, and, early, 7th, centuries, a, resurgent, late, 7th, century, powys, checked, mercian, advances, thelbald, of, mercia, looking, to, defend, recently, acquired, lands, had, built, wat, s, dyke, according, to, davies, this, had, been, with, the, agreement, of, king, elisedd, ap, gwylog, of, powys, as, this, boundary, extending, north, from, the, valley, of, the, river, severn, to, the, dee, estuary, gave, him, oswestry, another, theory, after, carbon, dating, placed, the, dyke, s, existence, 300, years, earlier, is, that, it, was, built, by, the, post, roman, rulers, of, wroxeter, king, offa, of, mercia, seems, to, have, continued, this, initiative, when, he, created, a, larger, earthwork, now, known, as, offa, s, dyke, clawdd, offa, davies, wrote, of, cyril, fox, s, study, of, offa, s, dyke, in, the, planning, of, it, there, was, a, degree, of, consultation, with, the, kings, of, powys, and, gwent, on, the, long, mountain, near, trelystan, the, dyke, veers, to, the, east, leaving, the, fertile, slopes, in, the, hands, of, the, welsh, near, rhiwabon, it, was, designed, to, ensure, that, cadell, ap, brochwel, retained, possession, of, the, fortress, of, penygadden, and, for, gwent, offa, had, the, dyke, built, on, the, eastern, crest, of, the, gorge, clearly, with, the, intention, of, recognizing, that, the, river, wye, and, its, traffic, belonged, to, the, kingdom, of, gwent, however, fox, s, interpretations, of, both, the, length, and, purpose, of, the, dyke, have, been, questioned, by, more, recent, research, in, 853, the, vikings, raided, anglesey, but, in, 856, rhodri, mawr, defeated, and, killed, their, leader, gorm, the, celtic, britons, of, wales, made, peace, with, the, vikings, and, anarawd, ap, rhodri, allied, with, the, norsemen, occupying, northumbria, to, conquer, the, north, this, alliance, later, broke, down, and, anarawd, came, to, an, agreement, with, alfred, king, of, wessex, with, whom, he, fought, against, the, west, welsh, according, to, annales, cambriae, in, 894, anarawd, came, with, the, angles, and, laid, waste, to, ceredigion, and, ystrad, tywi, the, southern, and, eastern, parts, of, great, britain, lost, to, english, settlement, became, known, in, welsh, as, lloegyr, modern, welsh, lloegr, which, may, have, referred, to, the, kingdom, of, mercia, originally, and, which, came, to, refer, to, england, as, a, whole, the, germanic, tribes, who, now, dominated, these,

themselves, brythoniaid, brythons, or, britons, well, into, the, middle, ages, though, the, first, written, evidence, of, the, use, of, cymru, and, y, cymry, is, found, in, a, praise, poem, to, cadwallon, ap, cadfan, moliant, cadwallon, by, afan, ferddig, c, 633, in, armes, prydein, believed, to, be, written, around, 930, 942, the, words, cymry, and, cymro, are, used, as, often, as, 15, times, however, from, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, onwards, the, people, gradually, begin, to, adopt, the, name, cymry, over, brythoniad, from, 800, onwards, a, series, of, dynastic, marriages, led,

an, explosion, in, demand, as, the, south, wales, coalfield, was, exploited, cardiff, swansea, penarth, and, barry, grew, as, world, exporters, of, coal, by, its, height, in, 1913, wales, was,

the, industrial, workers, of, wales, began, shifting, towards, the, labour, party, when, in, 1908, the, miners, federation, of, great, britain, became, affiliated, to, the, labour, party, the, four, labour, candidates, sponsored, by, miners, were, all, elected, as, mps, by, 1922, half, the, welsh, seats, at, westminster, were, held, by, labour, politicians, the, start, of, a, labour, dominance, of, welsh, politics, that, continued, into, the, 21st, century, after, economic, growth, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, wales, s, staple, industries, endured, a, prolonged,

and, 1, 122, 000, in, 1911, part, of, this, increase, can, be, attributed, to, the, demographic, transition, seen, in, most, industrialising, countries, during, the, industrial, revolution, as, death,
