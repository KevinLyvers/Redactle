curator, in, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, chicago, roy, a, native, of, india, studied, in, india, london, and, earned, his, ph, d, at, the, university, of, chicago, shortly, after, he, started, at, the, field, museum, he, joined, the, 1927, 1928, rawson, macmillan, expedition, to, baffin, island, and, labrador, this, 15, month, expedition, began, in, june, 1927, the, two, largest, lakes, on, the, island, lie, in, the, south, central, part, of, the, island, nettilling, lake, 5, 542, km, 2, and, amadjuak, lake, 3, 115, km, 2, further, south, baffin, island, has, been, inhabited, for, over, 3, 000, years, first, by, the, pre, dorset, followed, by, the, dorset, and, then, by, the, thule, people, ancestors, of, the, inuit, who, have, lived, on, the, island, for, the, last, thousand, years, the, thule, people, genetically, and, culturally, completely, replaced, the, dorset, people, some, time, after, 1300, ce, in, about, 986, erik, thorvaldsson, known, as, erik, the, red, formed, three, settlements, near, the, southwestern, tip, of, greenland, in, late, 985, or, 986, bjarni, herj, lfsson, sailing, from, iceland, to, greenland, was, blown, off, course, and, sighted, land, southwest, of, greenland, bjarni, appears, to, be, the, first, european, to, see, baffin, island, and, the, first, european, to, see, north, america, beyond, greenland, it, was, about, 15, years, later, that, the, norse, greenlanders, led, by, leif, erikson, a, son, of, erik, the, red, started, exploring, new, areas, around, the, year, 1000, baffin, island, is, thought, to, be, helluland, and, the, archaeological, site, at, tanfield, valley, is, thought, to, have, been, a, trading, post, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, 1880, translation, into, english, by, j, sephton, from, the, original, icelandic, eir, ks, saga, rau, a, they, sailed, away, from, land, then, to, the, vestribygd, and, to, bjarneyjar, the, bear, islands, thence, they, sailed, away, from, bjarneyjar, with, northerly, winds, they, were, out, at, sea, two, half, days, then, they, came, to, land, and, rowed, along, it, in, boats, and, explored, it, and, found, there, flat, stones, many, and, so, great, that, two, men, might, well, lie, on, them, stretched, on, their, backs, with, heel, to, heel, polar, foxes, were, there, in, abundance, this, land, they, gave, name, to, and, called, it, helluland, stone, land, in, september, 2008, the, nunatsiaq, news, a, weekly, newspaper, reported, that, patricia, sutherland, who, worked, at, the, canadian, museum, of, civilization, had, found, archaeological, remains, of, yarn, and, cordage, rat, droppings, tally, sticks, a, carved, wooden, dorset, culture, face, mask, depicting, caucasian, features, and, possible, architectural, remains, which, indicated, that, european, traders, and, possibly, settlers, had, been, on, baffin, island, not, later, than, 1000, ce, what, the, source, of, this, old, world, contact, may, have, been, is, unclear, and, controversial, the, newspaper, article, states, dating, of, some, yarn, and, other, artifacts, presumed, to, be, left, by, vikings, on, baffin, island, have, produced, an, age, that, predates, the, vikings, by, several, hundred, years, so, as, sutherland, said, if, you, believe, that, spinning, was, not, an, indigenous, technique, that, was, used, in, arctic, north, america, then, you, have, to, consider, the, possibility, that, as, remote, as, it, may, seem, these, finds, may, represent, evidence, of, contact, with, europeans, prior, to, the, vikings, arrival, in, greenland, sutherland, s, research, eventually, led, to, a, 2012, announcement, that, whetstones, had, been, found, with, remnants, of, alloys, indicative, of, viking, presence, in, 2018, michele, hayeur, smith, of, brown, university, who, specialises, in, the, study, of, ancient, textiles, wrote, that, she, does, not, think, the, ancient, arctic, people, the, dorset, and, thule, needed, to, be, taught, how, to, spin, yarn, it, s, a, pretty, intuitive, thing, to, do, the, date, received, on, sample, 4440b, from, nanook, clearly, indicates, that, sinew, was, being, spun, and, plied, at, least, as, early, if, not, earlier, than, yarn, at, this, site, we, feel, that, the, most, parsimonious, explanation, of, this, data, is, that, the, practice, of, spinning, hair, and, wool, into, plied, yarn, most, likely, developed, naturally, within, this, context, of, complex, indigenous, arctic, fiber, technologies, and, not, through, contact, with, european, textile, producers, our, investigations, indicate, that, paleoeskimo, dorset, communities, on, baffin, island, spun, threads, from, the, hair, and, also, from, the, sinews, of, native, terrestrial, grazing, animals, most, likely, musk, ox, and, arctic, hare, throughout, the, middle, dorset, period, and, for, at, least, a, millennium, before, there, is, any, reasonable, evidence, of, european, activity, in, the, islands, of, the, north, atlantic, or, in, the, north, american, arctic, a, long, running, debate, disputes, whether, the, vikings, taught, indigenous, peoples, in, the, canadian, arctic, how, to, spin, yarn, when, the, invaders, arrived, in, the, region, around, 1, 000, years, ago, the, team, found, that, some, of, the, spun, yarn, dates, back, at, least, 2, 000, years, long, before, the, vikings, arrived, in, the, area, this, shows, that, the, indigenous, peoples, in, the, canadian, arctic, developed, yarn, spinning, technologies, without, any, help, from, the, vikings, the, scientists, said, william, w, fitzhugh, director, of, the, arctic, studies, center, at, the, smithsonian, institution, and, a, senior, scientist, at, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, wrote, that, there, is, insufficient, published, evidence, to, support, sutherland, s, claims, and, that, the, dorset, were, using, spun, cordage, by, the, 6th, century, in, 1992, elizabeth, wayland, barber, wrote, that, a, piece, of, three, ply, yarn, that, dates, to, the, paleolithic, era, that, ended, about, 10, 000, bp, was, found, at, the, lascaux, caves, in, france, this, yarn, consisted, of, three, s, twist, strands, that, were, z, plied, much, like, the, way, a, three, ply, yarn, is, made, now, the, baffin, island, yarn, was, a, simple, two, ply, yarn, the, eight, sod, buildings, and, artifacts, found, in, the, 1960s, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, located, on, the, northern, tip, of, newfoundland, island, remains, the, only, confirmed, norse, site, in, north, america, outside, of, those, found, in, greenland, baffin, island, is, part, of, the, qikiqtaaluk, region, the, population, of, baffin, island, at, the, 2021, canadian, census, was, 13, 039, giving, a, population, density, of, 0, 03, km, 2, 0, 07, sq, mi, the, population, accounts, for, 67, 37, per, cent, of, the, 19, 355, people, in, the, qikiqtaaluk, region, 56, 51, per, cent, of, the, population, of, the, arctic, archipelago, and, 35, 38, per, cent, of, the, population, of, nunavut, as, of, the, 2016, canadian, census, the, majority, 74, 06, per, cent, were, indigenous, peoples, and, 25, 83, per, cent, were, non, indigenous, this, compares, to, 88, 85, per, cent, and, 14, 12, per, cent, indigenous, and, non, indigenous, people, for, nunavut, as, a, whole, this, lower, percentage, of, indigenous, peoples, on, baffin, island, results, from, iqaluit, being, 59, 29, per, cent, indigenous, and, 40, 65, per, cent, non, indigenous, of, the, total, population, 72, 17, per, cent, are, inuit, 0, 92, per, cent, are, first, nations, and, 0, 73, per, cent, are, m, tis, except, for, a, few, first, nations, people, in, arctic, bay, all, non, inuit, indigenous, peoples, live, in, iqaluit, the, hamlets, of, kinngait, population, 1, 396, and, qikiqtarjuaq, population, 593, do, not, lie, on, baffin, island, proper, kinngait, is, situated, on, dorset, island, which, is, located, a, few, kilometres, from, the, south, eastern, tip, of, the, foxe, peninsula, similarly, qikiqtarjuaq, is, situated, on, broughton, island, which, is, located, near, the, northern, coast, of, the, cumberland, peninsula, the, mary, river, mine, an, iron, ore, mine, with, an, estimated, 21, year, life, at, mary, river, may, include, building, a, railway, and, a, port, to, transport, the, ore, this, may, create, a, temporary, mining, community, there, baffin, island, is, home, to, the, dewey, soper, migratory, bird, sanctuary, and, the, bowman, bay, wildlife, sanctuary, the, dewey, soper, migratory, bird, sanctuary, named, for, j, dewey, soper, is, located, on, the, western, side, of, baffin, island, from, bowman, bay, to, the, koukdjuak, river, it, is, an, 8, 159, km, 2, 3, 150, sq, mi, area, that, was, classified, a, wetland, of, international, importance, via, the, ramsar, convention, on, may, 24, 1982, it, is, home, of, the, world, s, largest, goose, colony, and, supports, a, large, number, of, barren, ground, caribou, the, bowman, bay, wildlife, sanctuary, is, also, located, on, the, western, side, of, baffin, island, near, bowman, bay, in, the, great, plain, of, the, koukdjuak, it, is, 1, 079, km, 2, 417, sq, mi, and, is, classified, as, category, iv, habitat, species, management, area, under, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, baffin, island, has, both, year, round, and, summer, visitor, wildlife, on, land, examples, of, year, round, wildlife, are, barren, ground, caribou, polar, bear, arctic, fox, red, fox, arctic, hare, lemming, and, baffin, island, wolf, barren, ground, caribou, herds, migrate, in, a, limited, range, from, northern, baffin, island, down, to, the, southern, part, in, winter, even, to, the, frobisher, bay, peninsula, next, to, resolution, island, then, migrating, back, north, in, the, summer, in, 2012, a, survey, of, caribou, herds, found, that, the, local, population, was, only, about, 5, 000, a, decrease, of, as, much, as, 95, from, the, 1990s, arctic, hares, are, found, throughout, baffin, island, their, fur, is, pure, white, in, winter, and, moults, to, a, scruffy, dark, grey, in, summer, arctic, hares, and, lemmings, are, an, important, food, source, for, arctic, and, red, foxes, and, arctic, wolves, lemmings, are, also, found, throughout, the, island, and, are, a, major, food, source, for, foxes, wolves, and, the, snowy, owl, in, the, winter, lemmings, dig, complicated, tunnel, systems, through, the, snow, drifts, to, get, to, their, food, supply, of, dry, grasses, and, lichens, polar, bears, can, be, found, all, along, the, coast, of, baffin, island, but, are, most, prevalent, where, the, sea, ice, takes, the, form, of, pack, ice, where, their, major, food, sources, ringed, seals, jar, seal, and, bearded, seals, live, polar, bears, mate, approximately, every, year, bearing, one, to, three, cubs, around, march, female, polar, bears, may, travel, 10, 20, km, 6, 2, 12, 4, mi, inland, to, find, a, large, snow, bank, where, they, dig, a, den, in, which, to, spend, the, winter, and, later, give, birth, the, polar, bear, population, here, is, one, of, 19, genetically, distinct, demes, of, the, circumpolar, region, red, foxes, can, be, found, predominantly, in, the, southernmost, areas, of, baffin, island, away, from, the, harshest, of, winter, weather, though, some, individuals, may, forage, and, explore, elsewhere, the, arctic, foxes, can, usually, be, found, where, polar, bears, venture, on, the, fast, ice, close, to, land, in, their, search, for, seals, arctic, foxes, are, scavengers, and, often, follow, polar, bears, to, get, their, leavings, they, also, are, known, to, take, ground, nesting, birds, and, their, eggs, and, chicks, such, as, ducks, geese, ptarmigan, seagulls, shorebirds, and, even, snowy, owls, on, occasion, on, baffin, island, arctic, foxes, are, sometimes, trapped, by, inuit, but, there, is, no, longer, a, robust, fur, industry, the, arctic, wolf, and, the, baffin, island, wolf, a, grey, wolf, subspecies, are, also, year, round, residents, of, baffin, island, unlike, the, grey, wolf, in, southern, climes, arctic, wolves, often, have, smaller, social, networks, due, to, the, barren, landscape, and, minimal, resources, thus, resulting, in, unique, hierarchies, when, compared, with, wolves, found, further, south, for, example, arctic, wolves, often, do, not, hunt, in, packs, although, a, male, female, pair, may, hunt, together, nesting, birds, are, summer, land, visitors, to, baffin, island, baffin, island, is, one, of, the, major, nesting, destinations, from, the, eastern, and, mid, west, flyways, for, many, species, of, migrating, birds, waterfowl, include, eiders, canada, goose, snow, goose, cackling, goose, and, brant, goose, brent, goose, shore, birds, include, the, phalarope, various, waders, commonly, called, sandpipers, murres, including, br, nnich, s, guillemot, and, plovers, gull, species, also, nest, on, baffin, island, and, they, include, sabine, s, gull, glaucous, gull, herring, gull, and, ivory, gull, long, range, travellers, include, the, arctic, tern, which, migrates, from, antarctica, every, spring, the, varieties, of, water, birds, that, nest, here, include, coots, loons, mallards, and, many, other, duck, species, in, the, water, and, under, the, ice, the, main, year, round, species, is, the, ringed, seal, subspecies, the, arctic, ringed, seal, it, lives, offshore, within, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, of, land, in, winter, it, makes, a, number, of, breathing, holes, in, the, ice, up, to, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, thick, it, visits, each, one, often, to, keep, the, hole, open, and, free, from, ice, in, march, when, a, female, is, ready, to, whelp, she, will, enlarge, one, of, the, breathing, holes, that, has, snow, over, it, creating, a, small, igloo, where, she, whelps, one, or, two, pups, within, three, weeks, the, pups, are, in, the, water, and, swimming, in, summer, some, ringed, seals, keep, to, a, narrow, territory, about, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, along, the, shoreline, but, may, move, out, into, the, open, water, in, the, spring, they, spend, more, time, on, the, surface, of, the, ice, water, species, that, visit, baffin, island, in, the, summer, are, harp, seals, or, saddle, backed, seals, which, migrate, from, major, breeding, grounds, off, the, coast, of, labrador, and, the, southeast, coast, of, greenland, to, baffin, island, for, the, summer, migrating, at, speeds, of, 15, 20, km, h, 9, 3, 12, 4, mph, they, all, come, up, to, breathe, at, the, same, time, then, dive, and, swim, up, to, 1, 2, km, 0, 62, 1, 24, mi, before, surfacing, again, they, migrate, in, large, pods, consisting, of, a, hundred, or, more, seals, to, within, 1, 8, km, 0, 62, 4, 97, mi, of, the, shoreline, which, they, then, follow, feeding, on, crustaceans, and, fish, walruses, which, do, not, migrate, far, off, land, in, the, winter, they, merely, follow, the, fast, ice, or, ice, that, is, solidly, attached, to, land, and, stay, ahead, of, it, as, the, ice, hardens, further, and, further, out, to, sea, as, winter, progresses, they, will, always, remain, where, there, is, open, water, free, of, ice, when, the, ice, melts, they, move, in, to, land, and, can, be, found, basking, on, rocks, close, to, shore, one, of, the, largest, walrus, herds, can, be, found, in, the, foxe, basin, on, the, western, side, of, baffin, island, beluga, or, white, whales, migrate, along, the, coast, of, baffin, island, some, head, north, to, the, feeding, grounds, in, the, davis, strait, between, greenland, and, baffin, island, or, into, the, hudson, strait, or, any, of, the, bays, and, estuaries, in, between, usually, travelling, in, pods, of, two, or, more, they, can, often, be, found, very, close, to, shore, 100, m, or, less, they, come, up, to, breathe, every, 30, seconds, or, so, as, they, make, their, way, along, the, coastline, eating, crustaceans, narwhals, which, are, known, for, the, males, long, spiralling, single, tusk, can, also, be, found, along, the, coast, of, baffin, island, in, the, summer, much, like, their, beluga, cousins, they, may, be, found, in, pairs, or, even, in, a, large, pod, of, ten, or, more, males, females, and, newborns, they, also, can, be, often, found, close, to, the, shoreline, gracefully, pointing, their, tusks, skyward, as, they, come, up, for, air, the, largest, summer, visitor, to, baffin, island, is, the, bowhead, whale, found, throughout, the, arctic, range, one, group, of, bowhead, whales, is, known, to, migrate, to, the, foxe, basin, a, bay, on, the, western, side, of, baffin, island, baffin, island, lies, in, the, path, of, a, generally, northerly, airflow, all, year, round, so, like, much, of, northeastern, canada, it, has, an, extremely, cold, climate, this, brings, very, long, cold, winters, and, foggy, cloudy, summers, which, have, helped, to, add, to, the, remoteness, of, the, island, spring, thaw, arrives, much, later, than, normal, for, a, position, straddling, the, arctic, circle, around, early, june, at, iqaluit, in, the, south, east, but, around, early, to, mid, july, on, the, north, coast, where, glaciers, run, right, down, to, sea, level, snow, even, heavy, snow, can, occur, at, any, time, of, the, year, although, it, is, least, likely, in, july, and, early, august, average, annual, temperatures, at, iqaluit, are, around, 9, 5, c, 14, 9, f, compared, with, around, 5, c, 41, f, in, reykjav, k, which, is, at, a, similar, latitude, sea, ice, surrounds, the, island, for, most, of, the, year, and, only, disappears, completely, from, the, north, coast, for, short, unpredictable, periods, from, mid, to, late, june, until, the, end, of, september, most, of, baffin, island, lies, north, of, the, arctic, circle, all, communities, from, pangnirtung, northwards, have, polar, night, in, winter, and, midnight, sun, in, summer, the, eastern, community, of, clyde, river, has, twilight, instead, of, night, from, april, 26, until, may, 13, continuous, sunlight, for, 2, 1, 2, months, from, may, 14, to, july, 28, then, twilight, instead, of, night, from, july, 29, until, august, 16, this, gives, the, community, just, over, 3, 1, 2, months, without, true, night, in, the, winter, the, sun, sets, on, november, 22, and, does, not, rise, again, until, january, 19, of, the, next, year, pond, inlet, has, civil, twilight, from, december, 16, to, december, 26, however, there, is, twilight, for, at, least, 4, hours, per, day, unlike, places, such, as, eureka, like, most, of, nunavut, and, the, canadian, arctic, baffin, island, has, a, tundra, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, et, although, the, highest, ice, caps, have, an, ice, cap, climate, ef, the, sea, is, frozen, for, most, of, the, year, and, only, a, few, months, are, above, freezing, there, can, be, seasonal, lag, in, spring, the, barnes, ice, cap, in, the, middle, of, the, island, has, been, retreating, since, at, least, the, early, 1960s, when, the, geographical, branch, of, the, then, department, of, mines, and, technical, surveys, sent, a, three, man, survey, team, to, the, area, to, measure, isostatic, rebound, and, cross, valley, features, of, the, isortoq, river, although, in, the, 1970s, parts, of, baffin, island, failed, to, have, the, usual, ice, free, period, in, the, summer, climate, tables, from, south, to, north, the, hall, peninsula, of, southern, baffin, island, includes, the, chidliak, kimberlite, province, which, had, been, found, to, include, kimberlite, pipes, of, diamond, bearing, kimberlite, the, white, dawn, is, a, 1974, film, set, on, and, filmed, on, baffin, island, all, performers, except, three, hollywood, actors, were, inuit, who, spoke, their, own, language,
