significant, enough, that, they, were, shown, on, 18th, century, maps, the, colonists, also, mounted, armed, campaigns, against, the, maroons, who, generally, escaped, through, the, rainforest, which, they, knew, much, better, than, the, colonists, did, to, end, hostilities, in, the, 18th, century, the, european, colonial, authorities, signed, several, peace, treaties, with, different, tribes,

transition, period, expired, in, 1873, most, freedmen, largely, abandoned, the, plantations, where, they, had, worked, for, several, generations, in, favor, of, the, capital, city, paramaribo, some, of, them, were, able, to, purchase, the, plantations, they, worked, on, especially, in, the, district, of, para, and, coronie, their, descendants, still, live, on, those, grounds, today, several,
