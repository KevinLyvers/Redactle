century, jesuits, had, settled, along, its, banks, in, the, midst, of, numerous, tribes, manau, aru, k, and, trum, indians, after, 1700, slaving, along, the, river, was, common, and, native, american, populations, were, greatly, diminished, after, contact, with, eurasian, diseases, this, area, was, the, filming, location, for, survivor, the, amazon, in, 2003, while, the, name, rio, negro, means, black, river, its, waters, are, similar, in, colour, to, strong, tea, which, is, typical, of, blackwater, rivers, the, dark, color, comes, from, humic, acid, due, to, an, incomplete, breakdown, of, phenol, containing, vegetation, from, sandy, clearings, the, river, was, named, because, it, looks, black, from, a, distance, much, has, been, written, on, the, productivity, of, the, rio, negro, and, other, blackwater, rivers, the, older, idea, that, these, are, hunger, rivers, is, giving, way, with, new, research, to, the, recognition, that, the, rio, negro, for, example, supports, a, large, fishing, industry, and, has, numerous, turtle, beaches, if, explorers, did, not, find, many, indigenous, peoples, along, the, rio, negro, during, the, 17th, century, it, is, likely, that, their, populations, were, reduced, because, of, new, infectious, diseases, and, warfare, rather, than, low, river, productivity, rio, negro, has, a, very, high, species, richness, about, 700, fish, species, have, been, documented, in, the, river, basin, and, it, is, estimated, that, the, total, is, 800, 900, fish, species, including, almost, 100, endemics, and, several, undescribed, species, among, these, are, many, that, are, important, in, the, aquarium, trade, including, the, cardinal, tetra, as, a, result, of, the, casiquiare, canal, many, aquatic, species, are, found, both, in, the, rio, negro, and, orinoco, because, the, casiquiare, includes, both, blackwater, and, clear, to, whitewater, sections, only, relatively, adaptable, species, are, able, to, pass, through, it, between, the, two, river, systems, the, sixth, season, of, survivor, survivor, the, amazon, was, filmed, in, rio, negro, in, 2003
