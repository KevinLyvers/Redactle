lake, van, turkish, van, g, l, armenian, romanized, vana, li, kurdish, gola, wan, is, the, largest, lake, in, turkey, it, lies, in, the, eastern, anatolia, region, of, turkey, in, the, provinces, of, van, and, bitlis, it, is, a, saline, soda, lake, receiving, water, from, many, small, streams, that, descend, from, the, surrounding, mountains, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, few, endorheic, lakes, a, lake, having, no, outlet, of, size, greater, than, 3, 000, square, kilometres, 1, 200, sq, mi, and, has, 38, of, the, country, s, surface, water, including, rivers, a, volcanic, eruption, blocked, its, original, outlet, in, prehistoric, times, it, is, situated, at, 1, 640, m, 5, 380, ft, above, sea, level, despite, the, high, altitude, and, winter, averages, below, 0, c, 32, f, high, salinity, usually, prevents, it, from, freezing, the, shallow, northern, section, can, freeze, but, rarely, lake, van, is, 119, kilometres, 74, mi, across, at, its, widest, point, it, averages, 171, metres, 561, ft, deep, its, greatest, known, depth, is, 451, metres, 1, 480, ft, the, surface, lies, 1, 640, metres, 5, 380, ft, above, sea, level, and, the, shore, length, is, 430, kilometres, 270, mi, it, covers, 3, 755, km, 2, 1, 450, sq, mi, and, contains, has, a, volume, of, 607, cubic, kilometres, 146, cu, mi, the, western, portion, of, the, lake, is, deepest, with, a, large, basin, deeper, than, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, lying, northeast, of, tatvan, and, south, of, ahlat, the, eastern, arms, of, the, lake, are, shallower, the, van, ahtamar, portion, shelves, gradually, with, a, maximum, depth, of, about, 250, m, 820, ft, on, its, northwest, side, where, it, joins, the, rest, of, the, lake, the, erci, arm, is, much, shallower, mostly, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, with, a, maximum, depth, of, about, 150, m, 490, ft, the, lake, water, is, strongly, alkaline, ph, 9, 7, 9, 8, and, rich, in, sodium, carbonate, and, other, salts, some, is, extracted, in, salt, evaporation, ponds, alongside, used, in, or, as, detergents, lake, van, is, primarily, a, tectonic, lake, formed, more, than, 600, 000, years, ago, by, the, gradual, subsidence, of, a, large, block, of, the, earth, s, crust, due, to, movement, on, several, major, faults, that, run, through, this, portion, of, eastern, anatolia, the, lake, s, southern, margin, demarcates, a, metamorphic, rock, zone, of, the, bitlis, massif, and, volcanic, strata, of, the, neogene, and, quaternary, periods, the, deep, western, portion, of, the, lake, is, an, antidome, basin, in, a, tectonic, depression, this, was, formed, by, normal, and, strike, slip, faulting, and, thrusting, the, lake, s, proximity, to, the, karl, ova, triple, junction, has, led, to, molten, fluids, of, the, earth, s, mantle, accumulating, in, the, strata, beneath, still, driving, gradual, change, dominating, the, lake, s, northern, shore, is, the, stratovolcano, mount, s, phan, the, broad, crater, of, a, second, dormant, volcano, mount, nemrut, is, close, to, the, western, tip, of, the, lake, there, is, hydrothermal, activity, throughout, the, region, for, much, of, its, history, until, the, pleistocene, lake, van, has, had, an, outlet, towards, the, southwest, into, the, murat, river, and, eventually, into, the, euphrates, river, however, the, level, of, this, threshold, has, varied, over, time, as, the, lake, has, been, blocked, by, successive, lava, flows, from, nemrut, volcano, westward, towards, the, mu, plain, this, threshold, has, then, been, lowered, at, times, by, erosion, the, first, acoustic, survey, of, lake, van, was, performed, in, 1974, kempe, and, degens, later, identified, three, physiographic, provinces, comprising, the, lake, the, deepest, part, of, the, lake, is, the, tatvan, basin, which, is, almost, completely, bounded, by, faults, land, terraces, remnant, dry, upper, banks, from, previous, shorelines, above, the, present, shore, have, long, been, recognized, on, a, visit, in, 1898, geologist, felix, oswald, noted, three, raised, beaches, at, 15, 50, and, 100, feet, 5, 15, and, 30, meters, above, the, lake, then, as, well, as, recently, drowned, trees, research, in, the, past, century, has, identified, many, similar, terraces, and, the, lake, s, level, has, fluctuated, significantly, during, that, time, as, the, lake, has, no, outlet, the, level, over, recent, millennia, rests, on, inflow, and, evaporation, the, water, level, has, vacillated, greatly, investigation, by, a, team, including, degens, in, the, early, 1980s, determined, that, the, highest, lake, levels, 72, metres, 236, ft, above, the, current, height, had, been, during, the, last, ice, age, about, 18, 000, years, ago, approximately, 9, 500, years, ago, there, was, a, dramatic, drop, to, more, than, 300, metres, 980, ft, below, the, present, level, this, was, followed, by, an, equally, dramatic, rise, around, 6, 500, years, ago, as, a, deep, lake, with, no, outlet, lake, van, has, accumulated, great, amounts, of, sediment, washed, in, from, surrounding, plains, and, valleys, and, occasionally, deposited, as, ash, from, eruptions, of, nearby, volcanoes, this, layer, of, sediment, is, estimated, to, be, up, to, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, thick, in, places, and, has, attracted, climatologists, and, vulcanologists, interested, in, drilling, cores, to, examine, the, layered, sediments, in, 1989, and, 1990, an, international, team, of, geologists, led, by, stephan, kempe, from, the, university, of, hamburg, retrieved, ten, sediment, cores, from, depths, up, to, 446, m, 1, 463, ft, although, these, cores, only, penetrated, the, first, few, meters, of, sediment, they, provided, sufficient, varves, to, give, proxy, climate, data, for, up, to, 14, 570, years, bp, a, team, of, scientists, headed, by, palaeontologist, professor, thomas, litt, at, the, university, of, bonn, has, applied, for, funding, from, the, international, continental, scientific, drilling, program, icdp, for, an, akin, deeper, drilling, project, this, expects, to, find, it, stores, the, climate, history, of, the, last, 800, 000, years, an, incomparable, treasure, house, of, data, which, we, want, to, tap, for, at, least, the, last, 500, 000, years, a, test, drilling, in, 2004, detected, evidence, of, 15, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, past, 20, 000, years, similar, but, smaller, fluctuations, have, been, seen, recently, the, level, of, the, lake, rose, by, at, least, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, during, the, 1990, s, drowning, much, agricultural, land, and, after, a, brief, period, of, stability, and, then, retreat, seems, to, be, rising, again, the, level, rose, approximately, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, in, the, 10, years, immediately, prior, to, 2004, but, in, the, early, 2020s, it, fell, lake, van, is, in, the, highest, and, largest, region, of, turkey, which, has, a, mediterranean, influenced, humid, continental, climate, average, temperatures, in, july, are, between, 22, and, 25, c, and, in, january, between, 3, c, to, 12, c, on, some, cold, winter, nights, the, temperature, has, reached, 30, c, the, lake, particularly, on, its, urban, townscape, shore, tempers, the, climate, in, the, city, of, van, where, the, average, temperature, in, july, is, 22, 5, c, and, in, january, 3, 5, c, the, average, annual, rainfall, in, the, basin, ranges, from, 400, to, 700, mm, prior, to, 2018, the, only, fish, known, to, live, in, the, brackish, water, of, lake, van, was, alburnus, tarichi, or, pearl, mullet, turkish, inci, kefali, a, cyprinid, fish, related, to, chub, and, dace, which, is, caught, during, the, spring, floods, in, may, and, june, these, fish, migrate, from, the, lake, to, less, alkaline, water, spawning, either, near, the, mouths, of, the, rivers, feeding, the, lake, or, in, the, rivers, themselves, after, spawning, season, it, returns, to, the, lake, in, 2018, a, new, species, of, fish, which, is, deemed, as, oxynoemacheilus, ercisianus, has, been, discovered, inside, a, microbialite, 103, species, of, phytoplankton, have, been, recorded, in, the, lake, including, cyanobacteria, flagellates, diatoms, green, algae, and, brown, algae, 36, species, of, zooplankton, have, also, been, recorded, including, rotatoria, cladocera, and, copepoda, in, the, lake, in, 1991, researchers, reported, the, discovery, of, 40, m, 130, ft, tall, microbialites, in, the, lake, these, are, solid, towers, on, the, lake, bed, formed, by, coccoid, cyanobacteria, pleurocapsa, group, which, create, mats, of, aragonite, that, combine, with, calcite, precipitating, out, of, the, lake, water, the, region, hosts, the, rare, van, cat, breed, of, cat, having, among, other, things, an, unusual, fascination, with, water, the, lake, is, mainly, surrounded, by, fruit, orchards, and, grain, fields, interspersed, by, some, non, agricultural, trees, according, to, legend, the, lake, hosts, the, mysterious, lake, van, monster, that, lurks, below, the, surface, 30, to, 40, ft, 9, to, 12, m, long, with, brown, scaly, skin, an, elongated, reptilian, head, and, flippers, apart, from, some, inconclusive, amateur, photographs, and, videos, there, has, never, been, any, evidence, of, it, the, claimed, profile, resembles, an, extinct, mosasaurus, or, basilosaurus, tushpa, the, capital, of, urartu, near, the, shores, on, the, site, of, what, became, medieval, van, s, castle, west, of, present, day, van, city, the, ruins, of, the, medieval, city, of, van, are, still, visible, below, the, southern, slopes, of, the, rock, on, which, van, castle, stands, in, 2017, archaeologists, from, van, y, z, nc, yil, university, and, a, team, of, independent, divers, who, were, exploring, lake, van, reported, the, discovery, of, a, large, underwater, fortress, spanning, roughly, one, kilometer, the, team, estimates, that, this, fortress, was, constructed, during, the, urartian, period, based, on, their, visual, assessments, the, archaeologists, believe, that, the, fortress, along, with, other, parts, of, the, ancient, city, that, surrounded, it, at, the, time, had, slowly, become, submerged, over, the, millennia, by, the, gradually, rising, lake, the, lake, was, the, centre, of, the, kingdom, of, urartu, from, about, 1000, bc, afterwards, of, the, satrapy, of, armenia, kingdom, of, greater, armenia, and, the, armenian, kingdom, of, vaspurakan, along, with, lake, sevan, in, today, s, armenia, and, lake, urmia, in, today, s, iran, van, was, one, of, the, three, great, lakes, of, the, armenian, kingdom, referred, to, as, the, seas, of, armenia, in, ancient, assyrian, sources, t,

of, ar, e, sea, of, bznunik, sea, of, rshtunik, and, lake, of, tosp, by, the, 11th, century, the, lake, was, on, the, border, between, the, eastern, roman, empire, with, its, capital, at, constantinople, and, the, turko, persian, seljuk, empire, with, its, capital, at, isfahan, in, the, uneasy, peace, between, the, two, empires, local, armenian, byzantine, landowners, employed, turcoman, gazis, and, byzantine, akritai, for, protection, the, greek, speaking, byzantines, called, the, lake, thospitis, limne, medieval, greek, in, the, second, half, of, the, 11th, century, emperor, romanus, iv, diogenes, launched, a, campaign, to, re, conquer, armenia, and, head, off, growing, seljuk, control, diogenes, and, his, large, army, crossed, the, euphrates, and, confronted, a, much, smaller, seljuk, force, led, by, alp, arslan, at, the, battle, of, manzikert, north, of, lake, van, on, 26, august, 1071, despite, their, greater, numbers, the, cumbersome, byzantine, force, was, defeated, by, the, more, mobile, turkish, horsemen, and, diogenes, was, captured, alp, arslan, divided, the, conquered, eastern, portions, of, the, byzantine, empire, among, his, turcoman,
