the, indus, n, d, s, in, d, s, is, a, transboundary, river, of, asia, and, a, trans, himalayan, river, of, south, and, central, asia, the, 3, 180, km, 1, 980, mi, river, rises, in, mountain, springs, northeast, of, mount, kailash, in, western, tibet, flows, northwest, through, the, disputed, region, of, kashmir, bends, sharply, to, the, left, after, the, nanga, parbat, massif, and, flows, south, by, southwest, through, pakistan, before, emptying, into, the, arabian, sea, near, the, port, city, of, karachi, the, river, has, a, total, drainage, area, of, circa, 1, 120, 000, km, 2, 430, 000, sq, mi, its, estimated, annual, flow, is, around, 175, km, 3, a, 5, 500, m, 3, s, making, it, one, of, the, 50, largest, rivers, in, the, world, in, terms, of, average, annual, flow, its, left, bank, tributary, in, ladakh, is, the, zanskar, river, and, its, left, bank, tributary, in, the, plains, is, the, panjnad, river, which, is, formed, by, the, successive, confluences, of, the, five, punjab, rivers, namely, the, chenab, jhelum, ravi, beas, and, sutlej, rivers, its, principal, right, bank, tributaries, are, the, shyok, gilgit, kabul, kurram, and, gomal, rivers, beginning, in, a, mountain, spring, and, fed, with, glaciers, and, rivers, in, the, himalayan, karakoram, and, hindu, kush, ranges, the, river, supports, the, ecosystems, of, temperate, forests, plains, and, arid, countryside, the, northern, part, of, the, indus, valley, with, its, tributaries, forms, the, punjab, region, of, south, asia, while, the, lower, course, of, the, river, ends, in, a, large, delta, in, the, southern, sindh, province, of, pakistan, the, river, has, historically, been, important, to, many, cultures, of, the, region, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, saw, the, rise, of, indus, valley, civilisation, a, major, urban, civilization, of, the, bronze, age, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, punjab, region, was, mentioned, in, the, rigveda, hymns, as, sapta, sindhu, and, in, the, avesta, religious, texts, as, hapta, h, ndu, both, terms, meaning, seven, rivers, early, historical, kingdoms, that, arose, in, the, indus, valley, include, gandh, ra, and, the, ror, dynasty, of, sauv, ra, the, indus, river, came, into, the, knowledge, of, the, western, world, early, in, the, classical, period, when, king, darius, of, persia, sent, his, greek, subject, scylax, of, caryanda, to, explore, the, river, c, 515, bc, this, river, was, known, to, the, ancient, indians, in, sanskrit, as, sindhu, and, to, the, persians, as, hindu, h, ndu, which, was, regarded, by, both, of, them, as, the, border, river, the, variation, between, the, two, names, is, explained, by, the, old, iranian, sound, change, s, h, which, occurred, between, 850, and, 600, bc, according, to, asko, parpola, from, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, the, name, passed, to, the, greeks, as, ind, s, it, was, adopted, by, the, romans, as, indus, the, name, india, is, derived, from, indus, the, ladakhis, and, tibetans, call, the, river, senge, tsangpo, baltis, call, it, gemtsuh, and, tsuh, fo, pashtuns, call, it, nilab, sher, darya, and, abbasin, while, sindhis, call, it, sindhu, mehran, purali, and, samundar, the, modern, name, in, hindi, is, sindhu, and, in, urdu, is, dariya, e, sindh, urdu, hindi, a, semi, learned, borrowing, from, sanskrit, the, indus, river, provides, key, water, resources, for, pakistan, s, economy, especially, the, breadbasket, of, punjab, province, which, accounts, for, most, of, the, nation, s, agricultural, production, and, sindh, the, word, punjab, means, land, of, five, rivers, and, the, five, rivers, are, jhelum, chenab, ravi, beas, and, sutlej, all, of, which, finally, flow, into, the, indus, the, indus, also, supports, many, heavy, industries, and, provides, the, main, supply, of, potable, water, in, pakistan, the, total, length, of, the, river, varies, in, different, sources, the, length, used, in, this, article, is, 3, 180, km, 1, 980, mi, taken, from, the, himalayan, climate, and, water, atlas, 2015, historically, the, 1909, the, imperial, gazetteer, of, india, gave, it, as, just, over, 1, 800, miles, a, shorter, figure, of, 2, 880, km, 1, 790, mi, has, been, widely, used, in, modern, sources, as, has, the, one, of, 3, 180, km, 1, 980, mi, the, modern, encyclopedia, britannica, was, originally, published, in, 1999, with, the, shorter, measurement, but, was, updated, in, 2015, to, use, the, longer, measurement, both, lengths, are, commonly, found, in, modern, publications, in, some, cases, both, measurements, can, be, found, within, the, same, work, an, extended, figure, of, circa, 3, 600, km, 2, 200, mi, was, announced, by, a, chinese, research, group, in, 2011, based, on, a, comprehensive, remeasurement, from, satellite, imagery, and, a, ground, expedition, to, identify, an, alternative, source, point, but, detailed, analysis, has, not, yet, been, published, the, ultimate, source, of, the, indus, is, in, tibet, but, there, is, some, debate, about, the, exact, source, the, traditional, source, of, the, river, is, the, s, ngg, kanbab, s, ngg, zangbo, or, lion, s, mouth, a, perennial, spring, not, far, from, the, sacred, mount, kailash, marked, by, a, long, low, line, of, tibetan, chortens, there, are, several, other, tributaries, nearby, which, may, form, a, longer, stream, than, s, ngg, kanbab, but, unlike, the, s, ngg, kanbab, are, all, dependent, on, snowmelt, the, zanskar, river, which, flows, into, the, indus, in, ladakh, has, a, greater, volume, of, water, than, the, indus, itself, before, that, point, an, alternative, reckoning, begins, the, river, around, 300, km, further, upstream, at, the, confluence, of, the, s, ngg, zangbo, and, gar, tsangpo, rivers, which, drain, the, nganglong, kangri, and, gangdise, shan, gang, rinpoche, mt, kailash, mountain, ranges, the, 2011, remeasurement, suggested, the, source, was, a, small, lake, northeast, of, mount, kailash, rather, than, either, of, the, two, points, previously, used, the, indus, then, flows, northwest, through, ladakh, indian, administered, kashmir, and, baltistan, and, gilgit, pakistan, administered, kashmir, just, south, of, the, karakoram, range, the, shyok, shigar, and, gilgit, rivers, carry, glacial, waters, into, the, main, river, it, gradually, bends, to, the, south, and, descends, into, the, punjab, plains, at, kalabagh, pakistan, the, indus, passes, gigantic, gorges, 4, 500, 5, 200, metres, 15, 000, 17, 000, ft, deep, near, the, nanga, parbat, massif, it, flows, swiftly, across, hazara, and, is, dammed, at, the, tarbela, reservoir, the, kabul, river, joins, it, near, attock, the, remainder, of, its, route, to, the, sea, is, in, the, plains, of, the, punjab, and, sindh, where, the, flow, of, the, river, becomes, slow, and, highly, braided, it, is, joined, by, the, panjnad, at, mithankot, beyond, this, confluence, the, river, at, one, time, was, named, the, satnad, river, sat, seven, nad, river, as, the, river, now, carried, the, waters, of, the, kabul, river, the, indus, river, and, the, five, punjab, rivers, passing, by, jamshoro, it, ends, in, a, large, delta, to, the, south, of, thatta, in, the, sindh, province, of, pakistan, the, indus, is, one, of, the, few, rivers, in, the, world, to, exhibit, a, tidal, bore, the, indus, system, is, largely, fed, by, the, snow, and, glaciers, of, the, himalayas, karakoram, and, the, hindu, kush, ranges, the, flow, of, the, river, is, also, determined, by, the, seasons, it, diminishes, greatly, in, the, winter, while, flooding, its, banks, in, the, monsoon, months, from, july, to, september, there, is, also, evidence, of, a, steady, shift, in, the, course, of, the, river, since, prehistoric, times, it, deviated, westwards, from, flowing, into, the, rann, of, kutch, and, adjoining, banni, grasslands, after, the, 1816, earthquake, as, of, 2011, indus, water, flows, in, to, the, rann, of, kutch, during, its, floods, breaching, flood, banks, the, major, cities, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, such, as, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, date, back, to, around, 3300, bc, and, represent, some, of, the, largest, human, habitations, of, the, ancient, world, the, indus, valley, civilisation, extended, from, across, northeast, afghanistan, to, pakistan, and, northwest, india, with, an, upward, reach, from, east, of, the, jhelum, river, to, ropar, on, the, upper, sutlej, the, coastal, settlements, extended, from, sutkagan, dor, at, the, pakistan, iran, border, to, kutch, in, modern, gujarat, india, there, is, an, indus, site, on, the, amu, darya, at, shortughai, in, northern, afghanistan, and, the, indus, site, alamgirpur, at, the, hindon, river, is, located, only, 28, km, 17, mi, from, delhi, as, of, now, over, 1, 052, cities, and, settlements, have, been, found, mainly, in, the, general, region, of, the, ghaggar, hakra, river, and, its, tributaries, among, the, settlements, were, the, major, urban, centres, of, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, as, well, as, lothal, dholavira, ganeriwala, and, rakhigarhi, only, 40, indus, valley, sites, have, been, discovered, on, the, indus, and, its, tributaries, however, it, is, notable, that, majority, of, the, indus, script, seals, and, inscribed, objects, discovered, were, found, at, sites, along, the, indus, river, most, scholars, believe, that, settlements, of, gandhara, grave, culture, of, the, early, indo, aryans, flourished, in, gandhara, from, 1700, bc, to, 600, bc, when, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, had, already, been, abandoned, the, rigveda, describes, several, rivers, including, one, named, sindhu, the, rigvedic, sindhu, is, thought, to, be, the, present, day, indus, river, it, is, attested, 176, times, in, its, text, 94, times, in, the, plural, and, most, often, used, in, the, generic, sense, of, river, in, the, rigveda, notably, in, the, later, hymns, the, meaning, of, the, word, is, narrowed, to, refer, to, the, indus, river, in, particular, for, example, in, the, list, of, rivers, mentioned, in, the, hymn, of, nadistuti, sukta, the, rigvedic, hymns, apply, a, feminine, gender, to, all, the, rivers, mentioned, therein, except, for, the, brahmaputra, the, word, india, is, derived, from, the, indus, river, in, ancient, times, india, initially, referred, to, those, regions, immediately, along, the, east, bank, of, the, indus, where, are, punjab, and, sindh, now, but, by, 300, bc, greek, writers, including, herodotus, and, megasthenes, were, applying, the, term, to, the, entire, subcontinent, that, extends, much, farther, eastward, the, lower, basin, of, the, indus, forms, a, natural, boundary, between, the, iranian, plateau, and, the, indian, subcontinent, this, region, embraces, all, or, parts, of, the, pakistani, provinces, balochistan, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, punjab, and, sindh, and, the, countries, afghanistan, and, india, the, first, west, eurasian, empire, to, annex, the, indus, valley, was, the, persian, empire, during, the, reign, of, darius, the, great, during, his, reign, the, greek, explorer, scylax, of, caryanda, was, commissioned, to, explore, the, course, of, the, indus, it, was, crossed, by, the, invading, armies, of, alexander, still, after, his, macedonians, conquered, the, west, bank, joining, it, to, the, hellenic, world, they, elected, to, retreat, along, the, southern, course, of, the, river, ending, alexander, s, asian, campaign, alexander, s, admiral, nearchus, set, out, from, the, indus, delta, to, explore, the, persian, gulf, until, reaching, the, tigris, the, indus, valley, was, later, dominated, by, the, mauryan, and, kushan, empires, indo, greek, kingdoms, indo, scythians, and, hepthalites, over, several, centuries, muslim, armies, of, muhammad, ibn, al, qasim, mahmud, of, ghazni, muhammad, of, ghor, timur, and, babur, crossed, the, river, to, invade, sindh, and, punjab, providing, a, gateway, to, the, indian, subcontinent, indus, is, an, antecedent, river, meaning, that, it, existed, before, the, himalayas, and, entrenched, itself, while, they, were, rising, the, indus, river, feeds, the, indus, submarine, fan, which, is, the, second, largest, sediment, body, on, earth, it, consists, of, around, 5, million, cubic, kilometres, of, material, eroded, from, the, mountains, studies, of, the, sediment, in, the, modern, river, indicate, that, the, karakoram, mountains, in, northern, pakistan, and, india, are, the, single, most, important, source, of, material, with, the, himalayas, providing, the, next, largest, contribution, mostly, via, the, large, rivers, of, the, punjab, jhelum, ravi, chenab, beas, and, sutlej, analysis, of, sediments, from, the, arabian, sea, has, demonstrated, that, before, five, million, years, ago, the, indus, was, not, connected, to, these, punjab, rivers, which, instead, flowed, east, into, the, ganga, and, were, captured, after, that, time, earlier, work, showed, that, sand, and, silt, from, western, tibet, was, reaching, the, arabian, sea, by, 45, million, years, ago, implying, the, existence, of, an, ancient, indus, river, by, that, time, the, delta, of, this, proto, indus, river, has, subsequently, been, found, in, the, katawaz, basin, on, the, afghan, pakistan, border, in, the, nanga, parbat, region, the, massive, amounts, of, erosion, due, to, the, indus, river, following, the, capture, and, rerouting, through, that, area, are, thought, to, bring, middle, and, lower, crustal, rocks, to, the, surface, in, november, 2011, satellite, images, showed, that, the, indus, river, had, re, entered, india, and, was, feeding, the, great, rann, of, kutch, little, rann, of, kutch, and, a, lake, near, ahmedabad, known, as, nal, sarovar, heavy, rains, had, left, the, river, basin, along, with, the, lake, manchar, lake, hemal, and, kalri, lake, all, in, modern, day, pakistan, inundated, this, happened, two, centuries, after, the, indus, river, shifted, its, course, westwards, following, the, 1819, rann, of, kutch, earthquake, the, induan, age, at, the, start, of, the, triassic, period, of, geological, time, is, named, for, the, indus, region, accounts, of, the, indus, valley, from, the,

baburnama, extensive, deforestation, and, human, interference, in, the, ecology, of, the, shivalik, hills, has, led, to, a, marked, deterioration, in, vegetation, and, growing, conditions, the, indus, valley, regions, are, arid, with, poor, vegetation, agriculture, is, sustained, largely, due, to, irrigation, works, the, indus, river, and, its, watershed, have, a, rich, biodiversity, it, is, home, to, around, 25, amphibian, species, the, indus, river, dolphin, platanista, indicus, minor, is, found, only, in, the, indus, river, it, is, a, subspecies, of, the, south, asian, river, dolphin, the, indus, river, dolphin, formerly, also, occurred, in, the, tributaries, of, the, indus, river, according, to, the, world, wildlife, fund, it, is, one, of, the, most, threatened, cetaceans, with, only, about, 1, 816, still, existing, it, is, threatened, by, habitat, degradation, from, the, construction, of, dams, and, canals, entanglement, in, fishing, gear, and, industrial, water, pollution, there, are, two, otter, species, in, the, indus, river, basin, the, eurasian, otter, in, the, northeastern, highland, sections, and, the, smooth, coated, otter, elsewhere, in, the, river, basin, the, smooth,

home, of, more, than, 180, freshwater, fish, species, including, 22, which, are, found, nowhere, else, fish, also, played, a, major, role, in, earlier, cultures, of, the, region, including, the, ancient, indus, valley, civilisation, where, depictions, of, fish, were, frequent, the, indus, script, has, a, commonly, used, fish, sign, which, in, its, various, forms, may, simply, have, meant, fish, or, referred, to, stars, or, gods, in, the, uppermost, highest, part, of, the, indus, river, basin, there, are, relatively, few, genera, and, species, diptychus, ptychobarbus, schizopyge,

production, in, pakistan, the, river, is, especially, critical, since, rainfall, is, meagre, in, the, lower, indus, valley, irrigation, canals, were, first, built, by, the, people, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, and, later, by, the, engineers, of, the, kushan, empire, and, the, mughal, empire, modern, irrigation, was, introduced, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1850, the, construction, of, modern, canals, accompanied, with, the, restoration, of, old, canals, the, british, supervised, the, construction, of, one, of, the, most, complex, irrigation, networks, in, the, world, the, guddu, barrage, is, 1, 350, m, 4, 430, ft, long, irrigating, sukkur, jacobabad, larkana, and, kalat, the, sukkur, barrage, serves, over, 20, 000, km, 2, 7, 700, sq, mi, after, pakistan, came, into, existence, a, water, control, treaty, signed, between, india, and, pakistan, in, 1960, guaranteed, that, pakistan, would, receive, water, from, the, indus, river, and, its, two, tributaries, the, jhelum, river, and, the, chenab, river, independently, of, upstream, control, by, india, the, indus, basin, project, consisted, primarily, of, the, construction, of, two, main, dams, the, mangla, dam, built, on, the, jhelum, river, and, the, tarbela, dam, constructed, on, the, indus, river, together, with, their, subsidiary, dams, the, pakistan, water, and, power, development,

and, multan, pakistan, constructed, the, tarbela, dam, near, rawalpindi, standing, 2, 743, metres, 9, 000, ft, long, and, 143, metres, 470, ft, high, with, an, 80, kilometre, 50, mi, long, reservoir, it, supports, the, chashma, barrage, near, dera, ismail, khan, for, irrigation, use, and, flood, control, and, the, taunsa, barrage, near, dera, ghazi, khan, which, also, produces, 100, 000, kilowatts, of, electricity, the, kotri, barrage, near, hyderabad, is, 915, metres, 3, 000, ft, long, and, provides, additional, water, supplies, for, karachi, the, extensive, linking, of, tributaries, with, the, indus, has, helped, spread, water, resources, to, the, valley, of, peshawar, in, the, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, the, extensive, irrigation, and, dam, projects, provide, the, basis, for, pakistan, s, large, production, of, crops, such, as, cotton, sugarcane, and, wheat, the, dams, also, generate, electricity, for, heavy, industries, and, urban, centres, the, indus, river, is, sacred, to, hindus, the, sindhu, darshan, festival, is, held, on, every, guru, purnima, on, the, banks, of, the, indus, the, ethnicities, of, the, indus, valley, pakistan, and, northwest, india, have, a, greater, amount, of, ani, or, west, eurasian, admixture, than, other, south, asians, including, inputs, from, western, steppe, herders, with, evidence, of, more, sustained, and, multi, layered, migrations, from, the, west, originally, the, delta, used, to, receive, almost, all, of, the, water, from, the, indus, river, which, has, an, annual, flow, of, approximately, 180, billion, cubic, metres, 240, 10, 9, cu, yd, and, is, accompanied, by, 400, million, tonnes, 390, 10, 6, long, tons, of, silt, since, the, 1940s, dams, barrages, and, irrigation, works, have, been, constructed, on, the, river, the, indus, basin, irrigation, system, is, the, largest, contiguous, irrigation, system, developed, over, the, past, 140, years, anywhere, in, the, world, this, has, reduced, the, flow, of, water, and, by, 2018, the, average, annual, flow, of, water, below, the, kotri, barrage, was, 33, billion, cubic, metres, 43, 10, 9, cu, yd, and, annual, amount, of, silt, discharged, was, estimated, at, 100, million, tonnes, 98, 10, 6, long, tons, as, a, result, the, 2010, pakistan, floods, were, considered, good, news, for, the, ecosystem, and, population, of, the, river, delta, as,
