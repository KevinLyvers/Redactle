sometimes, defined, as, stretching, from, the, atlantic, shores, of, the, western, sahara, in, the, west, to, egypt, and, sudan, s, red, sea, coast, in, the, east, the, most, common, definition, for, the, region, s, boundaries, includes, algeria, egypt, libya, morocco, tunisia, and, western, sahara, the, territory, disputed, between, morocco, and, the, partially, recognized, sahrawi, arab,

in, excluding, the, sudan, the, sahel, south, of, the, sahara, desert, can, be, considered, as, the, southern, boundary, of, north, africa, north, africa, includes, the, spanish, cities, of, ceuta, and, melilla, and, the, plazas, de, soberan, a, it, can, also, be, considered, to, include, malta, as, well, as, other, italian, portuguese, and, spanish, regions, such, as, lampedusa, and, lampione, madeira, and, the, canary, islands, which, are, all, closer, or, as, close, to, the, african, continent, than, europe, northwest, africa, has, been, inhabited, by, berbers, since, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, while, the, eastern, part, of, north, africa, has, been, home, to, the, egyptians, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, arabs, from, the, arabian, peninsula, swept, across, the, region, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, the, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, began, immediately, after, which, started, a, long, process, of, islamization, and, arabization, that, has, defined, the, cultural, landscape, of, north, africa, ever, since, many, but, not, all, berbers, and, egyptians, gradually, merged, into, arab, islamic, culture, the, countries, and, people, of, north, africa, share, a, large, amount, of, their, genetic, ethnic, cultural, and, linguistic, identity, and, influence, with, the, middle, east, west, asia, a, process, that, began, with, the, neolithic, revolution, c, 10, 000, bc, and, pre, dynastic, egypt, the, countries, of, north, africa, are, also, a, major, part, of, the, arab, world, the, islamic, and, arab, influence, in, north, africa, has, remained, dominant, ever, since, with, the, region, being, major, part, of, the, muslim, world, north, africa, is, associated, with, the, middle, east, in, the, realm, of, geopolitics, to, form, the, middle, east, north, africa, region, north, africa, has, three, main, geographic, features, the, sahara, desert, in, the, south, the, atlas, mountains, in, the, west, and, the, nile, river, and, delta, in, the, east, the, atlas, mountains, extend, across, much, of, northern, algeria, morocco, and, tunisia, these, mountains, are, part, of, the, fold, mountain, system, that, also, runs, through, much, of, southern, europe, they, recede, to, the, south, and, east, becoming, a, steppe, landscape, before, meeting, the, sahara, desert, which, covers, more, than, 75, percent, of, the, region, the, tallest, peaks, are, in, the, high, atlas, range, in, south, central, morocco, which, has, many, snow, capped, peaks, south, of, the, atlas, mountains, is, the, dry, and, barren, expanse, of, the, sahara, desert, the, largest, sand, desert, in, the, world, in, places, the, desert, is, cut, by, irregular, watercourses, called, wadis, streams, that, flow, only, after, rainfall, but, are, usually, dry, the, sahara, s, major, landforms, include, ergs, large, seas, of, sand, that, sometimes, form, into, huge, dunes, the, hammada, a, level, rocky, plateau, without, soil, or, sand, and, the, reg, a, desert, pavement, the, sahara, covers, the, southern, part, of, algeria, morocco, and, tunisia, and, most, of, libya, only, two, regions, of, libya, are, outside, the, desert, tripolitania, in, the, northwest, and, cyrenaica, in, the, northeast, most, of, egypt, is, also, desert, with, the, exception, of, the, nile, river, and, the, irrigated, land, along, its, banks, the, nile, valley, forms, a, narrow, fertile, thread, that, runs, along, the, length, of, the, country, sheltered, valleys, in, the, atlas, mountains, the, nile, valley, and, delta, and, the, mediterranean, coast, are, the, main, sources, of, fertile, farming, land, a, wide, variety, of, valuable, crops, including, cereals, rice, and, cotton, and, woods, such, as, cedar, and, cork, are, grown, typical, mediterranean, crops, such, as, olives, figs, dates, and, citrus, fruits, also, thrive, in, these, areas, the, nile, valley, is, particularly, fertile, and, most, of, egypt, lives, close, to, the, river, elsewhere, irrigation, is, essential, to, improve, crop, yields, on, the, desert, margins, the, inhabitants, of, north, africa, are, roughly, divided, in, a, manner, corresponding, to, the, principal, geographic, regions, of, north, africa, the, maghreb, the, nile, valley, and, the, sahel, the, countries, making, up, north, africa, all, have, modern, standard, arabic, as, their, official, language, additionally, algeria, and, morocco, recognize, berber, as, a, second, official, language, after, arabic, french, also, serves, as, an, administrative, language, in, algeria, morocco, and, tunisia, the, most, spoken, dialects, are, maghrebi, arabic, a, form, of, ancient, arabic, dating, back, from, the, 8th, century, ad, and, egyptian, arabic, the, largest, and, most, numerous, ethnic, group, in, north, africa, are, the, arabs, in, algeria, and, morocco, berbers, are, the, second, largest, ethnic, group, after, the, arab, majority, arabs, constitute, 70, to, 80, of, the, population, of, algeria, 92, 97, of, libya, 67, to, 70, of, morocco, and, 98, of, tunisia, s, population, the, berbers, comprise, 20, of, algeria, 10, of, libya, 35, of, morocco, and, 1, of, tunisia, s, population, the, region, is, predominantly, muslim, with, a, jewish, minority, in, morocco, and, tunisia, and, significant, christian, minority, the, copts, in, egypt, algeria, morocco, libya, and, tunisia, in, 2001, the, number, of, christians, in, north, africa, was, estimated, at, 9, million, the, majority, of, whom, live, in, egypt, with, the, remainder, live, in, maghreb, countries, the, inhabitants, of, the, spanish, canary, islands, are, of, mixed, spanish, and, north, african, berber, ancestry, and, the, people, of, malta, are, of, primarily, southern, italian, sicilian, as, well, as, to, a, lesser, extent, north, african, and, middle, eastern, ancestry, and, speak, a, derivative, of, arabic, however, these, areas, are, not, generally, considered, part, of, north, africa, but, rather, southern, europe, due, to, their, proximity, to, mainland, europe, and, their, european, based, cultures, and, religion, the, maghreb, or, western, north, africa, on, the, whole, is, believed, to, have, been, inhabited, by, berbers, since, at, least, 10, 000, b, c, while, the, eastern, part, of, north, africa, or, the, nile, valley, has, mainly, been, home, to, the, egyptians, and, nubians, ancient, egyptians, record, extensive, contact, in, their, western, desert, with, people, that, appear, to, have, been, berber, or, proto, berber, as, the, tassili, n, ajjer, and, other, rock, art, findings, in, the, sahara, have, shown, the, sahara, also, hosted, various, populations, before, its, rapid, desertification, in, 3500, b, c, and, even, today, continues, to, host, small, populations, of, nomadic, trans, saharan, peoples, laboratory, examination, of, the, uan, muhuggiag, child, mummy, and, tin, hanakaten, child, suggesed, that, the, central, saharan, peoples, from, the, epipaleolithic, mesolithic, and, pastoral, periods, possessed, dark, skin, complexions, the, archaeological, evidence, from, the, holocene, period, has, shown, that, nilo, saharan, speaking, groups, had, populated, the, central, and, southern, sahara, before, the, influx, of, berber, and, arabic, speakers, around, 1500, years, ago, who, now, largely, populate, the, sahara, in, the, modern, era, several, waves, of, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, began, in, the, 7th, century, including, the, migration, of, the, banu, hilal, and, the, banu, sulaym, westward, into, the, maghreb, in, the, eleventh, century, which, introduced, arab, culture, and, language, to, the, countryside, historians, mark, their, movement, as, a, critical, moment, in, the, arabization, of, north, africa, as, arab, nomads, spread, the, territories, of, the, local, berber, tribes, were, moved, and, shrank, the, zenata, were, pushed, to, the, west, and, the, kabyles, were, pushed, to, the, north, the, berbers, took, refuge, in, the, mountains, whereas, the, plains, were, arabized, this, heavily, shifted, the, demographics, of, the, maghreb, the, majority, of, the, people, of, the, maghreb, and, the, sahara, regions, speak, varieties, of, arabic, and, almost, exclusively, follow, islam, the, arabic, and, berber, languages, are, distantly, related, both, being, members, of, the, afroasiatic, language, family, the, tuareg, berber, languages, are, notably, more, conservative, than, those, of, the, coastal, cities, over, the, years, berbers, have, been, influenced, by, contact, with, other, cultures, egyptians, greeks, punic, people, romans, vandals, arabs, europeans, and, africans, the, cultures, of, the, maghreb, and, the, sahara, therefore, combines, arab, indigenous, berber, and, african, elements, in, the, sahara, the, distinction, between, sedentary, oasis, inhabitants, and, nomadic, bedouin, arabs, and, tuaregs, is, particularly, marked, egyptians, over, the, centuries, have, shifted, their, language, from, egyptian, in, its, late, form, varieties, of, coptic, to, modern, egyptian, arabic, while, retaining, a, sense, of, national, identity, that, has, historically, set, them, apart, from, other, people, in, the, region, most, egyptians, are, sunni, muslim, although, there, is, a, significant, minority, of, coptic, christians, the, copts, are, the, largest, christian, denomination, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, the, maghreb, formerly, had, a, significant, jewish, population, almost, all, of, whom, emigrated, to, france, or, israel, when, the, north, african, nations, gained, independence, prior, to, the, modern, establishment, of, israel, there, were, about, 500, 000, jews, in, northern, africa, including, both, sephardi, jews, refugees, from, spain, france, and, portugal, from, the, renaissance, era, as, well, as, indigenous, mizrahi, jews, today, less, than, 3, 000, remain, in, the, region, almost, all, in, morocco, and, tunisia, and, are, mostly, part, of, a, french, speaking, urban, elite, see, jewish, exodus, from, arab, and, muslim, countries, due, to, the, recent, african, origin, of, modern, humans, the, history, of, prehistoric, north, africa, is, important, to, the, understanding, of, pre, hominid, and, early, modern, human, history, in, africa, some, researchers, have, postulated, that, north, africa, rather, than, east, africa, served, as, the, exit, point, for, the, modern, humans, who, first, trekked, out, of, the, continent, in, the, out, of, africa, migration, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, central, north, africa, have, left, behind, significant, remains, early, remnants, of, hominid, occupation, in, north, africa, for, example, were, found, in, ain, el, hanech, near, sa, da, c, 200, 000, bce, in, fact, more, recent, investigations, have, found, signs, of, oldowan, technology, there, and, indicate, a, date, of, up, to, 1, 8, million, bce, recent, finds, in, jebel, irhoud, in, morocco, have, been, found, to, contain, some, of, the, oldest, homo, sapiens, remains, this, suggests, that, rather, than, arising, only, in, east, africa, around, 200, 000, years, ago, early, homo, sapiens, may, already, have, been, present, across, the, length, of, africa, 100, 000, years, earlier, according, to, study, author, jean, jacques, hublin, the, idea, is, that, early, homo, sapiens, dispersed, around, the, continent, and, elements, of, human, modernity, appeared, in, different, places, and, so, different, parts, of, africa, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, what, we, call, modern, humans, today, early, humans, may, have, comprised, a, large, interbreeding, population, dispersed, across, africa, whose, spread, was, facilitated, by, a, wetter, climate, that, created, a, green, sahara, around, 330, 000, to, 300, 000, years, ago, the, rise, of, modern, humans, may, thus, have, taken, place, on, a, continental, scale, rather, than, being, confined, to, a, particular, corner, of, africa, in, september, 2019, scientists, reported, the, computerized, determination, based, on, 260, ct, scans, of, a, virtual, skull, shape, of, the, last, common, human, ancestor, to, modern, humans, h, sapiens, representative, of, the, earliest, modern, humans, and, suggested, that, modern, humans, arose, between, 260, 000, and, 350, 000, years, ago, through, a, merging, of, populations, in, east, and, southern, africa, the, cave, paintings, found, at, tassili, n, ajjer, north, of, tamanrasset, algeria, and, at, other, locations, depict, vibrant, and, vivid, scenes, of, everyday, life, in, central, north, africa, during, the, neolithic, subpluvial, period, about, 8000, to, 4000, bce, some, parts, of, north, africa, began, to, participate, in, the, neolithic, revolution, in, the, 6th, millennium, bce, just, before, the, rapid, desertification, of, the, sahara, around, 3500, b, c, largely, due, to, a, tilt, in, the, earth, s, orbit, it, was, during, this, period, that, domesticated, plants, and, animals, were, introduced, in, the, region, spreading, from, the, north, and, east, to, the, southwest, there, has, been, an, inferred, connection, between, areas, of, rapid, drying, and, the, introduction, of, livestock, in, which, the, natural, orbital, aridification, was, amplified, by, the, spread, of, shrubs, and, open, land, due, to, grazing, nevertheless, changes, in, northern, africa, s, ecology, after, 3500, bce, provided, the, backdrop, for, the, formation, of, dynastic, civilizations, and, the, construction, of, monumental, architecture, such, as, the, pyramids, of, giza, archaeological, evidence, has, attested, that, population, settlements, occurred, in, nubia, as, early, as, the, late, pleistocene, era, and, from, the, 5th, millennium, bc, onwards, whereas, there, is, no, or, scanty, evidence, of, human, presence, in, the, egyptian, nile, valley, during, these, periods, which, may, be, due, to, problems, in, site, preservation, several, scholars, have, argued, that, the, african, origins, of, the, egyptian, civilisation, derived, from, pastoral, communities, which, emerged, in, both, the, egyptian, and, sudanese, regions, of, the, nile, valley, in, the, fifth, millennium, bce, when, egypt, entered, the, bronze, age, the, maghreb, remained, focused, on, small, scale, subsistence, in, small, highly, mobile, groups, some, phoenician, and, greek, colonies, were, established, along, the, mediterranean, coast, during, the, 7th, century, bce, the, most, notable, nations, of, antiquity, in, western, north, africa, are, carthage, numidia, and, mauretania, the, phoenicians, colonized, much, of, north, africa, including, carthage, and, parts, of, present, day, morocco, including, chellah, essaouira, and, volubilis, the, carthaginians, were, of, phoenician, origin, with, the, roman, myth, of, their, origin, being, that, dido, a, phoenician, princess, was, granted, land, by, a, local, ruler, based, on, how, much, land, she, could, cover, with, a, piece, of, cowhide, she, ingeniously, devised, a, method, to, extend, the, cowhide, to, a, high, proportion, thus, gaining, a, large, territory, she, was, also, rejected, by, the, trojan, prince, aeneas, according, to, virgil, thus, creating, a, historical, enmity, between, carthage, and, rome, as, aeneas, would, eventually, lay, the, foundations, for, rome, ancient, carthage, was, a, commercial, power, and, had, a, strong, navy, but, relied, on, mercenaries, for, land, soldiers, the, carthaginians, developed, an, empire, in, the, iberian, peninsula, malta, sardinia, corsica, and, northwest, sicily, the, latter, being, the, cause, of, first, punic, war, with, the, romans, over, a, hundred, years, and, more, all, carthaginian, territory, was, eventually, conquered, by, the, romans, resulting, in, the, carthaginian, north, african, territories, becoming, the, roman, province, of, africa, in, 146, b, c, this, led, to, tension, and, eventually, conflict, between, numidia, and, rome, the, numidian, wars, are, notable, for, launching, the, careers, of, both, gaius, marius, and, sulla, and, stretching, the, constitutional, burden, of, the, roman, republic, as, marius, required, a, professional, army, something, previously, contrary, to, roman, values, to, overcome, the, talented, military, leader, jugurtha, kingdom, of, mauretania, remained, independent, until, being, annexed, to, the, roman, empire, by, emperor, claudius, in, 42, ad, north, africa, remained, a, part, of, the, roman, empire, producing, notable, citizens, including, augustine, of, hippo, until, incompetent, leadership, from, roman, commanders, in, the, early, fifth, century, allowed, the, germanic, peoples, the, vandals, to, cross, the, strait, of, gibraltar, whereupon, they, overcame, the, fickle, roman, defense, the, loss, of, north, africa, is, considered, a, pinnacle, point, in, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, as, africa, had, previously, been, an, important, grain, province, that, maintained, roman, prosperity, despite, the, barbarian, incursions, and, the, wealth, required, to, create, new, armies, the, issue, of, regaining, north, africa, became, paramount, to, the, western, empire, but, was, frustrated, by, vandal, victories, the, focus, of, roman, energy, had, to, be, on, the, emerging, threat, of, the, huns, in, 468, ad, the, romans, made, one, last, serious, attempt, to, invade, north, africa, but, were, repelled, this, perhaps, marks, the, point, of, terminal, decline, for, the, western, roman, empire, the, last, roman, emperor, was, deposed, in, 476, by, the, heruli, general, odoacer, trade, routes, between, europe, and, north, africa, remained, intact, until, the, coming, of, islam, some, berbers, were, members, of, the, early, african, church, but, evolved, their, own, donatist, doctrine, some, were, berber, jews, and, some, adhered, to, traditional, berber, religion, african, pope, victor, i, served, during, the, reign, of, roman, emperor, septimius, severus, furthermore, during, the, rule, of, the, romans, byzantines, vandals, ottomans, and, carthaginians, the, kabyle, people, were, the, only, or, one, of, the, few, in, north, africa, who, remained, independent, the, kabyle, people, were, incredibly, resistible, so, much, so, that, even, during, the, arab, conquest, of, north, africa, they, still, had, control, and, possession, over, their, mountains, the, early, muslim, conquests, included, north, africa, by, 640, by, 700, most, of, north, africa, had, come, under, muslim, rule, indigenous, berbers, subsequently, started, to, form, their, own, polities, in, response, in, places, such, as, fez, and, sijilmasa, in, the, eleventh, century, a, reformist, movement, made, up, of, members, that, called, themselves, the, almoravid, dynasty, expanded, south, into, sub, saharan, africa, north, africa, s, populous, and, flourishing,

that, the, lands, ravaged, by, banu, hilal, invaders, had, become, completely, arid, desert, after, the, middle, ages, much, of, the, area, was, loosely, under, the, control, of, the, ottoman, empire,
