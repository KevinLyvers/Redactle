the, mekong, or, mekong, river, is, a, trans, boundary, river, in, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, it, is, the, world, s, twelfth, longest, river, and, the, third, longest, in, asia, with, an, estimated, length, of, 4, 909, km, 3, 050, mi, and, a, drainage, area, of, 795, 000, km, 2, 307, 000, sq, mi, discharging, 475, km, 3, 114, cu, mi, of, water, annually, from, its, headwaters, in, the, tibetan, plateau, the, river, runs, through, southwest, china, where, it, is, officially, called, the, lancang, river, myanmar, laos, thailand, cambodia, and, southern, vietnam, the, extreme, seasonal, variations, in, flow, and, the, presence, of, rapids, and, waterfalls, in, the, mekong, make, navigation, difficult, even, so, the, river, is, a, major, trade, route, between, tibet, and, southeast, asia, the, construction, of, hydroelectric, dams, along, the, mekong, in, the, 2000s, through, the, 2020s, has, caused, serious, problems, for, the, river, s, ecosystem, including, the, exacerbation, of, drought, the, mekong, gets, its, english, name, from, khmer, m, k, ngk, mee, me, means, mother, and, k, kea, kong, means, ganga, the, literal, meaning, of, mekong, is, mother, ganga, kong, is, a, borrowing, into, khmer, language, of, the, sanskrit, word, ganga, the, mekong, is, named, after, hindu, godess, ganga, the, name, sake, of, the, river, ganges, the, local, names, for, the, river, include, the, mekong, rises, as, the, za, qu, tibetan, wylie, rdza, chu, zypy, za, qu, chinese, pinyin, z, q, and, soon, becomes, known, as, the, lancang, river, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, l, nc, ng, ji, ng, from, the, old, name, of, lao, kingdom, lan, xang, the, characters, may, also, be, literally, understood, as, turbulent, green, river, it, originates, in, the, three, rivers, source, area, on, the, tibetan, plateau, in, the, sanjiangyuan, national, nature, reserve, the, reserve, protects, the, headwaters, of, from, north, to, south, the, yellow, huang, he, the, yangtze, and, the, mekong, rivers, it, flows, through, the, tibetan, autonomous, region, and, then, southeast, into, yunnan, province, and, then, the, three, parallel, rivers, area, in, the, hengduan, mountains, along, with, the, yangtze, to, its, east, and, the, salween, river, nu, jiang, in, chinese, to, its, west, then, the, mekong, meets, the, china, myanmar, border, and, flows, about, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, along, that, border, until, it, reaches, the, tripoint, of, china, myanmar, and, laos, from, there, it, flows, southwest, and, forms, the, border, of, myanmar, and, laos, for, about, 100, km, 62, mi, until, it, arrives, at, the, tripoint, of, myanmar, laos, and, thailand, this, is, also, the, point, of, confluence, between, the, ruak, river, which, follows, the, thai, myanmar, border, and, the, mekong, the, area, of, this, tripoint, is, sometimes, termed, the, golden, triangle, although, the, term, also, refers, to, the, much, larger, area, of, those, three, countries, that, was, notorious, as, a, drug, producing, region, from, the, golden, triangle, tripoint, the, mekong, turns, southeast, to, briefly, form, the, border, of, laos, with, thailand, khon, pi, long, is, a, series, of, rapids, along, a, 1, 6, kilometre, section, of, the, mekong, river, dividing, chiang, rai, and, bokeo, province, in, laos, the, name, of, the, rapids, means, where, the, ghost, lost, its, way, it, then, turns, east, into, the, interior, of, laos, flowing, first, east, and, then, south, for, some, 400, km, 250, mi, before, meeting, the, border, with, thailand, again, once, more, it, defines, the, laos, thailand, border, for, some, 850, km, 530, mi, as, it, flows, first, east, passing, the, capital, of, laos, vientiane, then, turns, south, a, second, time, the, river, leaves, the, border, and, flows, east, into, laos, soon, passing, the, city, of, pakse, thereafter, it, turns, and, runs, more, or, less, directly, south, crossing, into, cambodia, at, phnom, penh, the, river, is, joined, on, the, right, bank, by, the, river, and, lake, system, the, tonl, sap, when, the, mekong, is, low, the, tonle, sap, is, a, tributary, water, flows, from, the, lake, and, river, into, the, mekong, when, the, mekong, floods, the, flow, reverses, the, floodwaters, of, the, mekong, flow, up, the, tonle, sap, immediately, after, the, sap, river, joins, the, mekong, by, phnom, penh, the, bassac, river, branches, off, the, right, west, bank, the, bassac, river, is, the, first, and, main, distributary, of, the, mekong, this, is, the, beginning, of, the, mekong, delta, the, two, rivers, the, bassac, to, the, west, and, the, mekong, to, the, east, enter, vietnam, shortly, after, this, in, vietnam, the, bassac, is, called, the, h, u, river, s, ng, h, u, or, h, u, giang, the, main, eastern, branch, of, the, mekong, is, called, the, ti, n, river, or, ti, n, giang, in, vietnam, distributaries, of, the, eastern, main, mekong, branch, include, the, m, tho, river, the, ba, lai, river, the, h, m, lu, ng, river, and, the, c, chi, n, river, the, mekong, basin, is, frequently, divided, into, two, parts, the, upper, mekong, basin, comprising, those, parts, of, the, basin, in, tibet, yunnan, and, eastern, myanmar, and, the, lower, mekong, basin, from, yunnan, downstream, from, china, to, the, south, china, sea, from, the, point, where, it, rises, to, its, mouth, the, most, precipitous, drop, in, the, mekong, occurs, in, the, upper, mekong, basin, a, stretch, of, some, 2, 200, km, 1, 400, mi, here, it, drops, 4, 500, m, 14, 800, ft, before, it, enters, the, lower, basin, where, the, borders, of, thailand, laos, china, and, myanmar, come, together, in, the, golden, triangle, downstream, from, the, golden, triangle, the, river, flows, for, a, further, 2, 600, km, 1, 600, mi, through, laos, thailand, and, cambodia, before, entering, the, south, china, sea, via, a, complex, delta, system, in, vietnam, the, upper, basin, makes, up, 24, of, the, total, area, and, contributes, 15, 20, of, the, water, that, flows, into, the, mekong, river, the, catchment, here, is, steep, and, narrow, with, soil, erosion, being, a, major, problem, and, as, a, result, of, this, approximately, 50, of, the, sediment, in, the, river, comes, from, the, upper, basin, in, yunnan, province, in, china, the, river, and, its, tributaries, are, confined, by, narrow, deep, gorges, the, tributary, river, systems, in, this, part, of, the, basin, are, small, only, 14, have, catchment, areas, that, exceed, 1, 000, km, 2, 390, sq, mi, yet, the, greatest, amount, of, loss, of, forest, cover, in, the, entire, river, system, per, square, kilometer, has, occurred, in, this, region, due, to, heavy, unchecked, demand, for, natural, resources, in, the, south, of, yunnan, in, simao, and, xishuangbanna, prefectures, the, river, changes, as, the, valley, opens, out, the, floodplain, becomes, wider, and, the, river, becomes, wider, and, slower, major, tributary, systems, develop, in, the, lower, basin, these, systems, can, be, separated, into, two, groups, tributaries, that, contribute, to, the, major, wet, season, flows, and, tributaries, that, drain, low, relief, regions, of, lower, rainfall, the, first, group, are, left, bank, tributaries, that, drain, the, high, rainfall, areas, of, laos, the, second, group, are, those, on, the, right, bank, mainly, the, mun, and, chi, rivers, that, drain, a, large, part, of, northeast, thailand, laos, lies, almost, entirely, within, the, lower, mekong, basin, its, climate, landscape, and, land, use, are, the, major, factors, shaping, the, hydrology, of, the, river, the, mountainous, landscape, means, that, only, 16, of, the, country, is, farmed, under, lowland, terrace, or, upland, shifting, cultivation, with, upland, shifting, agriculture, slash, and, burn, soils, recover, within, 10, to, 20, years, but, the, vegetation, does, not, shifting, cultivation, is, common, in, the, uplands, of, northern, laos, and, is, reported, to, account, for, as, much, as, 27, of, the, total, land, under, rice, cultivation, as, elsewhere, in, the, basin, forest, cover, has, been, steadily, reduced, during, the, last, three, decades, by, shifting, agriculture, and, permanent, agriculture, the, cumulative, impacts, of, these, activities, on, the, river, regime, have, not, been, measured, however, the, hydrological, impacts, of, land, cover, changes, induced, by, the, vietnam, war, were, quantified, in, two, sub, catchments, of, the, lower, mekong, river, basin, loss, of, forest, cover, in, the, thai, areas, of, the, lower, basin, has, been, the, highest, of, all, the, lower, mekong, countries, over, the, past, 60, years, on, the, khorat, plateau, which, includes, the, mun, and, chi, tributary, systems, forest, cover, was, reduced, from, 42, in, 1961, to, 13, in, 1993, although, this, part, of, northeast, thailand, has, an, annual, rainfall, of, more, than, 1, 000, mm, a, high, evaporation, rate, means, it, is, classified, as, a, semi, arid, region, consequently, although, the, mun, and, chi, basins, drain, 15, of, the, entire, mekong, basin, they, only, contribute, 6, of, the, average, annual, flow, sandy, and, saline, soils, are, the, most, common, soil, types, which, makes, much, of, the, land, unsuitable, for, wet, rice, cultivation, in, spite, of, poor, fertility, however, agriculture, is, intensive, glutinous, rice, maize, and, cassava, are, the, principal, crops, drought, is, by, far, the, major, hydrological, hazard, in, this, region, as, the, mekong, enters, cambodia, over, 95, of, its, flows, have, already, joined, the, river, from, here, on, downstream, the, terrain, is, flat, and, water, levels, rather, than, flow, volumes, determine, the, movement, of, water, across, the, landscape, the, seasonal, cycle, of, changing, water, levels, at, phnom, penh, results, in, the, unique, flow, reversal, of, water, into, and, out, of, the, great, lake, via, the, tonle, sap, river, phnom, penh, also, marks, the, beginning, of, the, delta, system, of, the, mekong, river, here, the, mainstream, begins, to, break, up, into, an, increasing, number, of, branches, in, cambodia, wet, rice, is, the, main, crop, and, is, grown, on, the, flood, plains, of, the, tonle, sap, mekong, and, bassac, the, mekong, delta, distributary, known, as, the, h, u, in, vietnam, rivers, more, than, half, of, cambodia, remains, covered, with, mixed, evergreen, and, deciduous, broadleaf, forest, but, forest, cover, has, decreased, from, 73, in, 1973, to, 63, in, 1993, here, the, river, landscape, is, flat, small, changes, in, water, level, determine, the, direction, of, water, movement, including, the, large, scale, reversal, of, flow, into, and, out, of, the, tonle, sap, basin, from, the, mekong, river, the, mekong, delta, in, vietnam, is, farmed, intensively, and, has, little, natural, vegetation, left, forest, cover, is, less, than, 10, in, the, central, highlands, of, vietnam, forest, cover, was, reduced, from, over, 95, in, the, 1950s, to, around, 50, in, the, mid, 1990s, agricultural, expansion, and, population, pressure, are, the, major, reasons, for, land, use, and, landscape, change, both, drought, and, flood, are, common, hazards, in, the, delta, which, many, people, believe, is, the, most, sensitive, to, upstream, hydrological, change, table, 1, country, share, of, mekong, river, basin, mrb, and, water, flows, by, taking, into, account, hydrological, regimes, physiography, land, use, and, existing, planned, and, potential, resource, developments, the, mekong, is, divided, into, six, distinct, reaches, reach, 1, lancang, jiang, or, upper, mekong, river, in, china, in, this, part, of, the, river, the, major, source, of, water, flowing, into, the, river, comes, from, melting, snow, on, the, tibetan, plateau, this, volume, of, water, is, sometimes, called, the, yunnan, component, and, plays, an, important, role, in, the, low, flow, hydrology, of, the, lower, mainstream, even, as, far, downstream, as, kratie, the, yunnan, component, makes, up, almost, 30, of, the, average, dry, season, flow, a, major, concern, is, that, the, ongoing, and, planned, expansion, of, dams, and, reservoirs, on, the, mekong, mainstream, in, yunnan, could, have, a, significant, effect, on, the, low, flow, regime, of, the, lower, mekong, basin, system, reach, 2, chiang, saen, to, vientiane, and, nong, khai, this, reach, is, almost, entirely, mountainous, and, covered, with, natural, forest, although, there, has, been, widespread, slash, and, burn, agriculture, although, this, reach, cannot, be, termed, unspoiled, the, hydrological, response, is, perhaps, the, most, natural, and, undisturbed, of, all, the, lower, basin, many, hydrological, aspects, of, the, lower, basin, start, to, change, rapidly, at, the, downstream, boundary, of, this, reach, on, 19, july, 2019, this, reach, of, the, river, dropped, to, its, lowest, level, in, a, century, officials, are, particularly, concerned, as, july, is, in, the, wet, season, when, mainstream, flows, are, abundant, historically, locals, are, blaming, low, water, on, the, newly, constructed, xayaburi, dam, as, it, enters, its, test, phase, prior, to, the, start, of, commercial, operation, in, october, 2019, reach, 3, vientiane, and, nong, khai, to, pakse, the, boundary, between, reach, 2, and, 3, is, where, the, mekong, hydrology, starts, to, change, reach, 2, is, dominated, in, both, wet, and, dry, seasons, by, the, yunnan, component, reach, 3, is, increasingly, influenced, by, contributions, from, the, large, left, bank, tributaries, in, laos, namely, the, nam, ngum, nam, theun, nam, hinboun, se, bang, fai, se, bang, hieng, and, se, done, rivers, the, mun, chi, river, system, from, the, right, bank, in, thailand, enters, the, mainstream, within, this, reach, reach, 4, pakse, to, kratie, the, main, hydrological, contributions, to, the, mainstream, in, this, reach, come, from, the, se, kong, se, san, and, sre, pok, catchments, together, these, rivers, make, up, the, largest, hydrological, sub, component, of, the, lower, basin, over, 25, of, the, mean, annual, flow, volume, to, the, mainstream, at, kratie, comes, from, these, three, river, basins, they, are, the, key, element, in, the, hydrology, of, this, part, of, the, system, especially, to, the, tonle, sap, flow, reversal, reach, 5, kratie, to, phnom, penh, this, reach, includes, the, hydraulic, complexities, of, the, cambodian, floodplain, the, tonle, sap, and, the, great, lake, by, this, stage, over, 95, of, the, total, flow, has, entered, the, mekong, system, the, focus, turns, from, hydrology, and, water, discharge, to, the, assessment, of, water, level, over, bank, storage, and, flooding, and, the, hydrodynamics, that, determine, the, timing, duration, and, volume, of, the, seasonal, flow, reversal, into, and, out, of, the, great, lake, reach, 6, phnom, penh, to, the, south, china, sea, here, the, mainstream, divides, into, a, complex, and, increasingly, controlled, and, artificial, system, of, branches, and, canals, key, features, of, flow, behaviour, are, tidal, influences, and, salt, water, intrusion, every, year, 35, 50, of, this, reach, is, flooded, during, the, rainy, season, the, impact, of, road, embankments, and, similar, infrastructure, developments, on, the, movement, of, this, flood, water, is, an, increasingly, important, consequence, of, development, table, 2, summarises, the, mean, annual, flows, along, the, mainstream, the, mean, annual, flow, entering, the, lower, mekong, from, china, is, equivalent, to, a, relatively, modest, 450, mm, depth, of, runoff, downstream, of, vientiane, this, increases, to, over, 600, mm, as, the, principal, left, bank, tributaries, enter, the, mainstream, mainly, the, nam, ngum, and, nam, theun, the, flow, level, falls, again, even, with, the, right, bank, entry, of, the, mun, chi, system, from, thailand, although, the, mun, chi, basin, drains, 20, of, the, lower, system, average, annual, runoff, is, only, 250, mm, runoff, in, the, mainstream, increases, again, with, the, entry, from, the, left, bank, of, the, se, kong, from, southern, laos, and, se, san, and, sre, pok, from, vietnam, and, cambodia, table, 2, lower, mekong, mainstream, annual, flow, 1960, to, 2004, at, selected, sites, flows, at, chiang, saen, entering, the, lower, basin, from, yunnan, make, up, about, 15, of, the, wet, season, flow, at, kratie, this, rises, to, 40, during, the, dry, season, even, this, far, downstream, during, the, wet, season, the, proportion, of, average, flow, coming, from, yunnan, rapidly, decreases, downstream, of, chiang, saen, from, 70, to, less, than, 20, at, kratie, the, dry, season, contribution, from, yunnan, is, much, more, significant, the, major, portion, of, the, balance, comes, from, laos, which, points, to, a, major, distinction, in, the, low, flow, hydrology, of, the, river, one, fraction, comes, from, melting, snow, in, china, and, tibet, and, the, rest, from, over, season, catchment, storage, in, the, lower, basin, this, has, implications, for, the, occurrence, of, drought, conditions, for, example, if, runoff, from, melting, snow, in, any, given, year, is, very, low, then, flows, upstream, of, vientiane, nong, khai, would, be, lower, in, a, large, river, system, like, the, mekong, seasonal, flows, can, be, quite, variable, from, year, to, year, although, the, pattern, of, the, annual, hydrograph, is, fairly, predictable, its, magnitude, is, not, the, average, monthly, flows, along, the, mainstream, are, listed, in, table, 3, providing, an, indication, of, their, range, and, variability, from, year, to, year, at, pakse, for, example, flood, season, flows, during, august, would, exceed, 20, 000, cubic, metres, per, second, nine, years, out, of, ten, but, exceed, 34, 000, m, 3, s, only, one, year, in, ten, table, 3, mekong, mainstream, monthly, discharge, 1960, 2004, m, 3, s, there, is, little, evidence, from, the, last, 45, years, of, data, of, any, systematic, changes, in, the, hydrological, regime, of, the, mekong, the, internal, drainage, patterns, of, the, mekong, are, unusual, when, compared, to, those, of, other, large, rivers, most, large, river, systems, that, drain, the, interiors, of, continents, such, as, the, amazon, congo, and, mississippi, have, relatively, simple, dendritic, tributary, networks, that, resemble, a, branching, tree, typically, such, patterns, develop, in, basins, with, gentle, slopes, where, the, underlying, geological, structure, is, fairly, homogeneous, and, stable, exerting, little, or, no, control, on, river, morphology, in, marked, contrast, the, tributary, networks, of, the, salween, yangtze, and, particularly, the, mekong, are, complex, with, different, sub, basins, often, exhibiting, different, and, distinct, drainage, patterns, these, complex, drainage, systems, have, developed, in, a, setting, where, the, underlying, geological, structure, is, heterogeneous, and, active, and, is, the, major, factor, controlling, the, course, of, rivers, and, the, landscapes, they, carve, out, the, elevation, of, the, tibetan, plateau, during, the, tertiary, period, was, an, important, factor, in, the, genesis, of, the, south, west, monsoon, which, is, the, dominant, climatic, control, influencing, the, hydrology, of, the, mekong, basin, understanding, the, nature, and, timing, of, the, elevation, of, tibet, and, the, central, highlands, of, vietnam, therefore, helps, explain, the, provenance, of, sediment, reaching, the, delta, and, the, tonle, sap, great, lake, today, studies, of, the, provenance, of, sediments, in, the, mekong, delta, reveal, a, major, switch, in, the, source, of, sediments, about, eight, million, years, ago, ma, from, 36, to, 8, ma, the, bulk, 76, of, the, sediments, deposited, in, the, delta, came, from, erosion, of, the, bedrock, in, the, three, rivers, area, from, 8, ma, to, the, present, however, the, contribution, from, the, three, rivers, area, fell, to, 40, while, that, from, the, central, highlands, rose, from, 11, to, 51, one, of, the, most, striking, conclusions, of, provenance, studies, is, the, small, contribution, of, sediment, from, the, other, parts, of, the, mekong, basin, notably, the, khorat, plateau, the, uplands, of, northern, laos, and, northern, thailand, and, the, mountain, ranges, south, of, the, three, rivers, area, the, last, glacial, period, came, to, an, abrupt, end, about, 19, 000, years, ago, 19, ka, when, sea, levels, rose, rapidly, reaching, a, maximum, of, about, 4, 5, m, above, present, levels, in, the, early, holocene, about, 8, ka, at, this, time, the, shoreline, of, the, south, china, sea, almost, reached, phnom, penh, and, cores, recovered, from, near, angkor, borei, contained, sediments, deposited, under, the, influence, of, tides, and, salt, marsh, and, mangrove, swamp, deposits, sediments, deposited, in, the, tonle, sap, great, lake, about, this, time, 7, 9, 7, 3, ka, also, show, indications, of, marine, influence, suggesting, a, connection, to, the, south, china, sea, although, the, hydraulic, relationships, between, the, mekong, and, the, tonle, sap, great, lake, systems, during, the, holocene, are, not, well, understood, it, is, clear, that, between, 9, 000, and, 7, 500, years, ago, the, confluence, of, the, tonle, sap, and, the, mekong, was, in, proximity, to, the, south, china, sea, the, present, river, morphology, of, the, mekong, delta, developed, over, the, last, 6, 000, years, during, this, period, the, delta, advanced, 200, km, over, the, continental, shelf, of, the, south, china, sea, covering, an, area, of, more, than, 62, 500, km, 2, from, 5, 3, to, 3, 5, ka, the, delta, advanced, across, a, broad, embayment, formed, between, higher, ground, near, the, cambodian, border, and, uplands, north, of, ho, chi, minh, city, during, this, phase, of, its, development, the, delta, was, sheltered, from, the, wave, action, of, long, shore, currents, and, was, constructed, largely, through, fluvial, and, tidal, processes, at, this, time, the, delta, was, advancing, at, a, rate, of, 17, 18, m, per, year, after, 3, 5, ka, however, the, delta, had, built, out, beyond, the, embayment, and, became, subject, to, wave, action, and, marine, currents, these, deflected, deposition, south, eastwards, in, the, direction, of, the, c, mau, peninsula, which, is, one, of, the, most, recent, features, of, the, delta, for, much, of, its, length, the, mekong, flows, through, bedrock, channels, i, e, channels, that, are, confined, or, constrained, by, bedrock, or, old, alluvium, in, the, bed, and, riverbanks, geomorphologic, features, normally, associated, with, the, alluvial, stretches, of, mature, rivers, such, as, meanders, oxbow, lakes, cut, offs, and, extensive, floodplains, are, restricted, to, a, short, stretch, of, the, mainstream, around, vientiane, and, downstream, of, kratie, where, the, river, develops, alluvial, channels, that, are, free, of, control, exerted, by, the, underlying, bedrock, the, mekong, basin, is, not, normally, considered, a, seismically, active, area, as, much, of, the, basin, is, underlain, by, the, relatively, stable, continental, block, nonetheless, the, parts, of, the, basin, in, northern, laos, northern, thailand, myanmar, and, china, do, experience, frequent, earthquakes, and, tremors, the, magnitude, of, these, earthquakes, rarely, exceeds, 6, 5, on, the, richter, magnitude, scale, and, is, unlikely, to, cause, material, damage, the, difficulty, of, navigating, the, river, has, meant, that, it, has, divided, rather, than, united, the, people, who, live, near, it, the, earliest, known, settlements, date, to, 210, bce, with, ban, chiang, being, an, excellent, example, of, early, iron, age, culture, the, earliest,

mid, 19th, century, capturing, saigon, in, 1861, and, establishing, a, protectorate, over, cambodia, in, 1863, the, first, systematic, european, exploration, began, with, the, french, mekong, expedition, led, by, ernest, doudard, de, lagr, e, and, francis, garnier, which, ascended, the, river, from, its, mouth, to, yunnan, between, 1866, and, 1868, their, chief, finding, was, that, the, mekong, had, too, many, falls, and, rapids, to, ever, be, useful, for, navigation, the, river, s, source, was, found, by, pyotr, kuzmich, kozlov, in, 1900, from, 1893, the, french, extended, their,

delta, up, the, river, into, tonle, sap, and, beyond, but, is, now, extinct, in, the, river, along, with, being, extinct, in, all, of, vietnam, and, possibly, even, cambodia, the, low, tide, level, of, the, river, in, cambodia, is, lower, than, the, high, tide, level, out, at, sea, and, the, flow, of, the, mekong, inverts, with, the, tides, throughout, its, stretch, in, vietnam, and, up, to, phnom, penh, the, very, flat, mekong, delta, area, in, vietnam, is, thus, prone, to, flooding, especially, in, the, provinces, of, an, giang, and, dong, thap, ng, th, p, near, the, cambodian, border, aquatic, biodiversity, in, the, mekong, river, system, is, the, second, highest, in, the, world, after, the, amazon, the, mekong, boasts, the, most, concentrated, biodiversity, per, hectare, of, any, river, the, largest, recorded, freshwater, fish, a, 300, kg, giant, freshwater, stingray, in, 2022, and, previously, a, 293, kg, mekong, giant, catfish, in, 2005, were, both, caught, in, the, mekong, river, the, commercially, valuable, fish, species, in, the, mekong, are, generally, divided, between, black, fish, which, inhabit, low, oxygen, slow, moving, shallow, waters, and, white, fish, which, inhabit, well, oxygenated, fast, moving, deeper, waters, people, living, within, the, mekong, river, system, generate, many, other, sources, of, food, and, income, from, what, are, often, termed, other, aquatic, animals, oaas, such, as, freshwater, crabs, shrimp, snakes, turtles, and, frogs, oaas, account, for, about, 20, of, the, total, mekong, catch, when, fisheries, are, discussed, catches, are, typically, divided, between, the, wild, capture, fishery, i, e, fish, and, other, aquatic, animals, caught, in, their, natural, habitat, and, aquaculture, fish, reared, under, controlled, conditions, wild, capture, fisheries, play, the, most, important, role, in, supporting, livelihoods, wild, capture, fisheries, are, largely, open, access, fisheries, which, poor, rural, people, can, access, for, food, and, income, broadly, there, are, three, types, of, fish, habitats, in, the, mekong, i, the, river, including, all, the, main, tributaries, rivers, in, the, major, flood, zone, and, the, tonle, sap, which, altogether, yield, about, 30, of, wild, catch, landings, ii, rain, fed, wetlands, outside, the, river, floodplain, zone, including, mainly, rice, paddies, in, formerly, forested, areas, and, usually, inundated, to, about, 50, cm, yielding, about, 66, of, wild, catch, landings, and, iii, large, water, bodies, outside, the, flood, zone, including, canals, and, reservoirs, yielding, about, 4, of, wild, catch, landings, the, mekong, basin, has, one, of, the, world, s, largest, and, most, productive, inland, fisheries, an, estimated, two, million, tonnes, of, fish, are, landed, a, year, in, addition, to, almost, 500, 000, tonnes, of, other, aquatic, animals, aquaculture, yields, about, two, million, tonnes, of, fish, a, year, hence, the, lower, mekong, basin, yields, about, 4, 5, million, tonnes, of, fish, and, aquatic, products, annually, the, total, economic, value, of, the, fishery, is, between, us, 3, 9, and, us, 7, billion, a, year, wild, capture, fisheries, alone, have, been, valued, at, us, 2, billion, a, year, this, value, increases, considerably, when, the, multiplier, effect, is, included, but, estimates, vary, widely, an, estimated, 2, 56, million, tonnes, of, inland, fish, and, other, aquatic, animals, are, consumed, in, the, lower, mekong, every, year, aquatic, resources, make, up, between, 47, and, 80, of, animal, protein, in, rural, diets, for, people, who, live, in, the, lower, mekong, basin, fish, are, the, cheapest, source, of, animal, protein, in, the, region, and, any, decline, in, the, fishery, is, likely, to, significantly, impact, nutrition, especially, among, the, poor, fish, are, the, staple, of, the, diet, in, laos, and, cambodia, with, around, 80, of, the, cambodian, population, s, annual, protein, intake, coming, from, fish, caught, in, the, mekong, river, system, with, no, alternative, source, to, replace, it, an, mrc, report, claims, that, dam, projects, on, the, mekong, river, will, reduce, aquatic, life, by, 40, by, 2020, and, predicted, that, 80, of, fish, will, be, depleted, by, 2040, thailand, will, be, impacted, as, its, fish, stocks, in, the, mekong, will, decline, by, 55, laos, will, be, reduced, by, 50, cambodia, by, 35, and, vietnam, by, 30, it, is, estimated, that, 40, million, rural, people, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, rural, population, in, the, lower, mekong, basin, are, engaged, in, the, wild, capture, fishery, fisheries, contribute, significantly, to, a, diversified, livelihood, strategy, for, many, people, particularly, the, poor, who, are, highly, dependent, on, the, river, and, its, resources, for, their, livelihoods, they, provide, a, principal, form, of, income, for, numerous, people, and, act, as, a, safety, net, and, coping, strategy, in, times, of, poor, agricultural, harvests, or, other, difficulties, in, laos, alone, 71, of, rural, households, 2, 9, million, people, rely, on, fisheries, for, either, subsistence, or, additional, cash, income, around, the, tonle, sap, lake, in, cambodia, more, than, 1, 2, million, people, live, in, fishing, communes, and, depend, almost, entirely, on, fishing, for, their, livelihoods, dams, in, the, mekong, reference, those, built, for, hydropower, irrigation, and, other, uses, such, as, water, supply, as, of, february, 2024, dams, in, the, mekong, are, distributed, as, follows, table, 4, dams, in, the, mekong, river, basin, notes, hpps, hydropower, plants, data, calculated, from, the, cgiar, research, program, on, water, land, and, ecosystems, greater, mekong, dataset, on, the, dams, of, the, irrawaddy, mekong, red, and, salween, river, basins, only, hpps, with, an, installed, capacity, of, 15, megawatts, mw, or, more, are, included, and, or, dams, with, a, reservoir, area, of, 0, 5, km, 2, or, more, there, are, also, multiple, hpps, under, construction, within, the, basin, as, of, february, 2024, there, is, one, under, construction, in, cambodia, three,

currently, under, construction, in, laos, and, another, in, china, for, thousands, of, years, the, mekong, river, has, been, an, important, conduit, for, people, and, goods, between, the, many, towns, on, its, banks, traditional, forms, of, trade, in, small, boats, linking, communities, continue, today, however, the, river, is, also, becoming, an, important, link, in, international, trade, routes, connecting, the, six, mekong, countries, to, each, other, and, also, to, the, rest, of, the, world, the, mekong, is, still, a, wild, river, and, navigation, conditions, vary, greatly, along, its, length, broadly, navigation, of, the, river, is, divided, between, upper, and, lower, mekong, with, the, upper, part, of, the, river, defined, as, the, stretch, north, of, the, khone, falls, in, southern, laos, and, the, lower, part, as, the, stretch, below, these, falls, narrower, and, more, turbulent, sections, of, water, in, the, upstream, parts, of, the, mekong, river, coupled, with, large, annual, water, level, variations, continue, to, present, a, challenge, to, navigation, the, seasonal, variations, in, water, level, directly, affect, trade, in, this, section, of, the, river, volumes, of, trade, being, shipped, decrease, by, more, than, 50, primarily, due, to, the, reduced, draughts, available, during, the, low, water, season, june, january, despite, these, difficulties, the, mekong, river, is, already, an, important, link, in, the, transit, chain, between, kunming, and, bangkok, with, about, 300, 000, tonnes, of, goods, shipped, via, this, route, each, year, the, volume, of, this, trade, is, expected, to, increase, by, 8, 11, per, year, port, infrastructure, is, being, expanded, to, accommodate, the, expected, growth, in, traffic, with, new, facilities, planned, for, chiang, saen, port, in, laos, 50, and, 100, dwt, vessels, are, operated, for, regional, trade, cargos, carried, are, timber, agricultural, products, and, construction, materials, thailand, imports, a, wide, variety, of, products, from, china, including, vegetables, fruit, agricultural, products, and, fertilisers, the, main, exports, from, thailand, are, dried, longan, fish, oil, rubber, products, and, consumables, nearly, all, the, ships, carrying, cargo, to, and, from, chiang, saen, port, are, 300, dwt, chinese, flag, vessels, waterborne, trade, in, the, lower, mekong, countries, of, vietnam, and, cambodia, has, grown, significantly, with, trends, in, container, traffic, at, phnom, penh, port, and, general, cargo, through, can, tho, port, both, showing, steady, increases, until, 2009, when, a, decrease, in, cargo, volumes, can, be, attributed, to, the, global, financial, crisis, and, a, subsequent, decline, in, demand, for, the, export, of, garments, to, the, us, in, 2009, mekong, trade, received, a, significant, boost, with, the, opening, of, a, new, deep, water, port, at, cai, mep, in, vietnam, this, new, port, has, generated, a, renewed, focus, on, the, mekong, river, as, a, trade, route, the, cai, mep, container, terminals, can, accommodate, vessels, with, a, draught, of, 15, 2, m, equivalent, to, the, largest, container, ships, in, the, world, these, mother, vessels, sail, directly, to, europe, or, the, united, states, which, means, that, goods, can, be, shipped, internationally, to, and, from, phnom, penh, with, only, a, single, transshipment, at, cai, mep, as, an, international, river, a, number, of, agreements, exist, between, the, countries, that, share, the, mekong, to, enable, trade, and, passage, between, them, the, most, important, of, these, which, address, the, full, length, of, the, river, are, in, december, 2016, the, thai, cabinet, of, prime, minister, prayut, chan, o, cha, agreed, in, principle, to, a, plan, to, dredge, stretches, of, the, mekong, and, demolish, rocky, outcrops, that, are, hindrances, to, easy, navigation, the, international, lancang, mekong, river, navigation, improvement, plan, for, 2015, 2025, conceived, by, china, myanmar, lao, and, thailand, aims, to, make, the, river, more, navigable, for, 500, tonne, cargo, vessels, sailing, the, river, from, yunnan, to, luang, prabang, a, distance, of, 890, kilometres, china, has, been, the, driving, force, behind, the, demolition, plan, as, it, aims, to, expand, trade, in, the, area, the, plan, is, split, into, two, phases, the, first, phase, from, 2015, to, 2020, involves, a, survey, a, design, and, an, assessment, of, the, environmental, and, social, impacts, of, the, project, these, have, to, be, approved, by, the, four, countries, involved, china, laos, myanmar, thailand, the, second, phase, 2020, 2025, involves, navigational, improvements, from, simao, in, china, to, 243, border, posts, in, china, and, myanmar, a, distance, of, 259, km, local, groups, have, countered, that, native, inhabitants, already, operate, their, boats, year, round, and, that, the, plan, to, blast, the, rapids, is, not, about, making, life, better, for, local, people, but, about, enabling, year, round, traffic, of, large, chinese, commercial, boats, on, 4, february, 2020, the, thai, cabinet, voted, to, stop, the, project, to, blast, and, dredge, 97, km, of, the, river, bed, after, beijing, failed, to, stump, up, the, money, for, further, surveys, of, the, affected, area, construction, of, myanmar, laos, friendship, bridge,
