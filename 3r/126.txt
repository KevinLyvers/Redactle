lake, vostok, russian, romanized, ozero, vostok, is, the, largest, of, antarctica, s, 675, known, subglacial, lakes, lake, vostok, is, located, at, the, southern, pole, of, cold, beneath, russia, s, vostok, station, under, the, surface, of, the, central, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, which, is, at, 3, 488, m, 11, 444, ft, above, mean, sea, level, the, surface, of, this, fresh, water, lake, is, approximately, 4, 000, m, 13, 100, ft, under, the, surface, of, the, ice, which, places, it, at, approximately, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, below, sea, level, measuring, 250, km, 160, mi, long, by, 50, km, 30, mi, wide, at, its, widest, point, it, covers, an, area, of, 12, 500, km, 2, 4, 830, sq, mi, making, it, the, 16th, largest, lake, by, surface, area, with, an, average, depth, of, 432, m, 1, 417, ft, it, has, an, estimated, volume, of, 5, 400, km, 3, 1, 300, cu, mi, making, it, the, 6th, largest, lake, by, volume, the, lake, is, divided, into, two, deep, basins, by, a, ridge, the, liquid, water, depth, over, the, ridge, is, about, 200, m, 700, ft, compared, to, roughly, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, deep, in, the, northern, basin, and, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, deep, in, the, southern, the, lake, is, named, after, vostok, station, which, in, turn, is, named, after, the, vostok, a, sloop, of, war, which, means, east, in, russian, the, existence, of, a, subglacial, lake, in, the, vostok, region, was, first, suggested, by, russian, geographer, andrey, kapitsa, based, on, seismic, soundings, made, during, the, soviet, antarctic, expeditions, in, 1959, and, 1964, to, measure, the, thickness, of, the, ice, sheet, the, continued, research, by, russian, and, british, scientists, led, to, the, final, confirmation, of, the, existence, of, the, lake, in, 1993, by, j, p, ridley, using, ers, 1, laser, altimetry, the, overlying, ice, provides, a, continuous, paleoclimatic, record, of, 400, 000, years, although, the, lake, water, itself, may, have, been, isolated, for, 15, to, 25, million, years, on, 5, february, 2012, a, team, of, russian, scientists, completed, the, longest, ever, ice, core, of, 3, 768, m, 12, 400, ft, and, pierced, the, ice, shield, to, the, surface, of, the, lake, the, first, core, of, freshly, frozen, lake, ice, was, obtained, on, 10, january, 2013, at, a, depth, of, 3, 406, m, 11, 175, ft, however, as, soon, as, the, ice, was, pierced, water, from, the, underlying, lake, gushed, up, the, borehole, mixing, it, with, the, freon, and, kerosene, used, to, keep, the, borehole, from, freezing, a, new, borehole, was, drilled, and, an, allegedly, pristine, water, sample, was, obtained, in, january, 2015, the, russian, team, plans, to, eventually, lower, a, probe, into, the, lake, to, collect, water, samples, and, sediments, from, the, bottom, it, is, hypothesized, that, unusual, forms, of, life, could, be, found, in, the, lake, s, liquid, layer, a, fossil, water, reserve, because, lake, vostok, may, contain, an, environment, sealed, off, below, the, ice, for, millions, of, years, the, conditions, could, resemble, those, of, ice, covered, oceans, hypothesized, to, exist, on, jupiter, s, moon, europa, and, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, russian, scientist, peter, kropotkin, first, proposed, the, idea, of, fresh, water, under, antarctic, ice, sheets, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, he, theorized, that, the, tremendous, pressure, exerted, by, the, cumulative, mass, of, thousands, of, vertical, meters, of, ice, could, decrease, the, melting, point, at, the, lowest, portions, of, the, ice, sheet, to, the, point, where, the, ice, would, become, liquid, water, kropotkin, s, theory, was, further, developed, by, russian, glaciologist, igor, zotikov, who, wrote, his, phd, thesis, on, this, subject, in, 1967, russian, geographer, andrey, kapitsa, used, seismic, soundings, in, the, region, of, vostok, station, made, during, the, soviet, antarctic, expedition, in, 1959, and, 1964, to, measure, the, thickness, of, the, ice, sheet, kapitsa, was, the, first, to, suggest, the, existence, of, a, subglacial, lake, in, the, region, and, the, subsequent, research, confirmed, his, hypothesis, when, british, scientists, in, antarctica, performed, airborne, ice, penetrating, radar, surveys, in, the, early, 1970s, they, detected, unusual, radar, readings, at, the, site, which, suggested, the, presence, of, a, liquid, freshwater, lake, below, the, ice, in, 1991, jeff, ridley, a, remote, sensing, specialist, with, the, mullard, space, science, laboratory, at, university, college, london, directed, the, ers, 1, satellite, to, turn, its, high, frequency, array, toward, the, center, of, the, antarctic, ice, cap, the, data, from, ers, 1, confirmed, the, findings, from, the, 1973, british, surveys, but, these, new, data, were, not, published, in, the, journal, of, glaciology, until, 1993, space, based, radar, revealed, that, this, subglacial, body, of, fresh, water, is, one, of, the, largest, lakes, in, the, world, and, one, of, some, 140, subglacial, lakes, in, antarctica, russian, and, british, scientists, delineated, the, lake, in, by, integrating, a, variety, of, data, including, airborne, ice, penetrating, radar, imaging, observations, and, space, based, radar, altimetry, and, the, discovery, of, the, lake, was, published, in, the, science, journal, nature, on, 20, june, 1996, it, has, been, confirmed, that, the, lake, contains, large, amounts, of, liquid, water, under, the, more, than, 3, kilometer, thick, 1, 9, mi, ice, cap, the, lake, has, at, least, 22, cavities, of, liquid, water, averaging, 10, kilometers, 6, mi, each, the, station, after, which, the, lake, is, named, commemorates, the, vostok, the, 900, ton, sloop, of, war, ship, sailed, by, one, of, the, discoverers, of, antarctica, russian, explorer, admiral, fabian, von, bellingshausen, because, the, word, vostok, means, east, in, russian, the, names, of, the, station, and, lake, also, reflect, the, fact, that, they, are, located, in, east, antarctica, in, 2005, an, island, was, found, in, the, central, part, of, the, lake, then, in, january, 2006, the, discovery, of, two, nearby, smaller, lakes, under, the, ice, cap, was, published, they, are, named, 90, degrees, east, and, sovetskaya, it, is, suspected, that, these, antarctic, subglacial, lakes, may, be, connected, by, a, network, of, subglacial, rivers, centre, for, polar, observation, modelling, glaciologists, propose, that, many, of, the, subglacial, lakes, of, antarctica, are, at, least, temporarily, interconnected, because, of, varying, water, pressure, in, individual, lakes, large, subsurface, rivers, may, suddenly, form, and, then, force, large, amounts, of, water, through, the, solid, ice, africa, separated, from, antarctica, around, 160, million, years, ago, followed, by, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, early, cretaceous, about, 125, million, years, ago, about, 66, million, years, ago, antarctica, then, connected, to, australia, still, had, a, tropical, to, subtropical, climate, complete, with, marsupial, fauna, and, an, extensive, temperate, rainforest, the, lake, vostok, basin, is, a, small, 50, kilometer, wide, 31, mi, tectonic, feature, within, the, overall, setting, of, a, several, hundred, kilometer, wide, continental, collision, zone, between, the, gamburtsev, mountain, range, a, subglacial, mountain, range, and, the, dome, c, region, the, lake, water, is, cradled, on, a, bed, of, sediments, 70, meters, 230, ft, thick, offering, the, possibility, that, they, contain, a, unique, record, of, the, climate, and, life, in, antarctica, before, the, ice, cap, formed, the, lake, water, is, estimated, to, have, been, sealed, off, under, the, thick, ice, sheet, about, 15, million, years, ago, initially, it, was, thought, that, the, same, water, had, made, up, the, lake, since, the, time, of, its, formation, giving, a, residence, time, in, the, order, of, one, million, years, later, research, by, robin, bell, and, michael, studinger, from, the, lamont, doherty, earth, observatory, of, columbia, university, suggested, that, the, water, of, the, lake, is, continually, freezing, and, being, carried, away, by, the, motion, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, while, being, replaced, by, water, melting, from, other, parts, of, the, ice, sheet, in, these, high, pressure, conditions, this, resulted, in, an, estimate, that, the, entire, volume, of, the, lake, is, replaced, every, 13, 300, years, its, effective, mean, residence, time, the, coldest, naturally, occurring, temperature, ever, observed, on, earth, 89, c, 128, f, was, recorded, at, vostok, station, on, 21, july, 1983, the, average, water, temperature, is, calculated, to, be, around, 3, c, 27, f, it, remains, liquid, below, the, normal, freezing, point, because, of, high, pressure, from, the, weight, of, the, ice, above, it, geothermal, heat, from, the, earth, s, interior, may, warm, the, bottom, of, the, lake, while, the, ice, sheet, itself, insulates, the, lake, from, cold, temperatures, on, the, surface, lake, vostok, is, an, oligotrophic, extreme, environment, one, that, is, expected, to, be, supersaturated, with, nitrogen, and, oxygen, measuring, 2, 5, litres, 0, 088, cu, ft, of, nitrogen, and, oxygen, per, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, water, that, is, 50, times, higher, than, those, typically, found, in, ordinary, freshwater, lakes, on, earth, s, surface, the, sheer, weight, and, pressure, around, 345, bars, 5, 000, psi, of, the, continental, ice, cap, on, top, of, lake, vostok, is, estimated, to, contribute, to, the, high, gas, concentration, besides, dissolving, in, the, water, oxygen, and, other, gases, are, trapped, in, a, type, of, structure, called, a, clathrate, in, clathrate, structures, gases, are, enclosed, in, an, icy, cage, and, look, like, packed, snow, these, structures, form, at, the, high, pressure, depths, of, lake, vostok, and, would, become, unstable, if, brought, to, the, surface, in, april, 2005, german, russian, and, japanese, researchers, found, that, the, lake, has, tides, depending, on, the, position, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, the, surface, of, the, lake, rises, about, 12, mm, 0, 47, in, the, lake, is, under, complete, darkness, under, 355, bar, 5, 150, psi, of, pressure, and, expected, to, be, rich, in, oxygen, so, there, is, speculation, that, any, organisms, inhabiting, the, lake, could, have, evolved, in, a, manner, unique, to, this, environment, there, is, a, 1, microtesla, magnetic, anomaly, on, the, east, coast, of, the, lake, spanning, 105, by, 75, km, 65, by, 47, mi, researchers, hypothesize, that, the, anomaly, may, be, caused, by, a, thinning, of, the, earth, s, crust, in, that, location, living, hydrogenophilus, thermoluteolus, micro, organisms, have, been, found, in, lake, vostok, s, deep, ice, core, drillings, they, are, an, extant, surface, dwelling, species, this, suggests, the, presence, of, a, deep, biosphere, utilizing, a, geothermal, system, of, the, bedrock, encircling, the, subglacial, lake, there, is, optimism, that, microbial, life, in, the, lake, may, be, possible, despite, high, pressure, constant, cold, low, nutrient, input, potentially, high, oxygen, concentration, and, an, absence, of, sunlight, jupiter, s, moon, europa, and, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, may, also, harbor, lakes, or, oceans, below, a, thick, crust, of, ice, any, confirmation, of, life, in, lake, vostok, could, strengthen, the, prospect, for, the, presence, of, life, on, icy, moons, researchers, working, at, vostok, station, produced, one, of, the, world, s, longest, ice, cores, in, 1998, a, joint, russian, french, and, united, states, team, drilled, and, analyzed, the, core, which, is, 3, 623, m, 11, 886, ft, long, ice, samples, from, cores, drilled, close, to, the, top, of, the, lake, have, been, assessed, to, be, as, old, as, 420, 000, years, the, assumption, is, that, the, lake, has, been, sealed, from, the, surface, since, the, ice, sheet, was, formed, 15, million, years, ago, drilling, of, the, core, was, deliberately, halted, roughly, 100, m, 300, ft, above, the, suspected, boundary, between, the, ice, sheet, and, the, liquid, waters, of, the, lake, this, was, to, prevent, contamination, of, the, lake, with, the, 60, ton, column, of, freon, and, kerosene, used, to, prevent, the, borehole, from, collapsing, and, freezing, over, from, this, core, specifically, from, ice, that, is, thought, to, have, formed, from, lake, water, freezing, onto, the, base, of, the, ice, sheet, extremophile, microbes, were, found, suggesting, that, the, lake, water, supports, life, scientists, suggested, that, the, lake, could, possess, a, unique, habitat, for, ancient, bacteria, with, an, isolated, microbial, gene, pool, containing, characteristics, developed, perhaps, 500, 000, years, ago, in, january, 2011, the, head, of, the, russian, antarctic, expedition, valery, lukin, announced, that, his, team, had, only, 50, m, 200, ft, of, ice, left, to, drill, in, order, to, reach, the, water, the, researchers, then, switched, to, a, new, thermal, drill, head, with, a, clean, silicone, oil, fluid, to, drill, the, rest, of, the, way, instead, of, drilling, all, the, way, into, the, water, they, said, they, would, stop, just, above, it, when, a, sensor, on, the, thermal, drill, detected, free, water, at, that, point, the, drill, was, to, be, stopped, and, extracted, from, the, bore, hole, removal, of, the, drill, would, lower, the, pressure, beneath, it, drawing, water, into, the, hole, to, be, left, to, freeze, creating, a, plug, of, ice, in, the, bottom, of, the, hole, drilling, stopped, on, 5, february, 2011, at, a, depth, of, 3, 720, m, 12, 200, ft, so, that, the, research, team, could, make, it, off, the, ice, before, the, beginning, of, the, antarctic, winter, season, the, drilling, team, left, by, aircraft, on, 6, february, 2011, by, plan, the, following, summer, the, team, was, to, drill, down, again, to, take, a, sample, of, that, ice, and, analyze, it, the, russians, resumed, drilling, into, the, lake, in, january, 2012, and, reached, the, upper, surface, of, the, water, on, 6, february, 2012, the, researchers, allowed, the, rushing, lake, water, to, freeze, within, the, bore, hole, and, months, later, they, collected, ice, core, samples, of, this, newly, formed, ice, and, sent, them, to, the, laboratory, for, glaciology, and, environmental, geophysics, in, grenoble, france, for, analysis, scientists, first, reported, evidence, of, microbes, in, the, accretion, ice, in, 1999, since, then, a, different, team, led, by, scott, o, rogers, has, been, identifying, a, variety, of, bacteria, and, fungi, from, accretion, ice, not, from, the, subglacial, water, layer, collected, during, u, s, drilling, projects, in, the, 1990s, according, to, him, this, indicates, that, the, lake, below, the, ice, is, not, sterile, but, contains, a, unique, ecosystem, then, scott, rogers, published, in, july, 2013, that, his, team, performed, nucleic, acid, dna, and, rna, sequencing, and, the, results, allowed, deduction, of, the, metabolic, pathways, represented, in, the, accretion, ice, and, by, extension, in, the, lake, the, team, found, 3, 507, unique, gene, sequences, and, approximately, 94, of, the, sequences, were, from, bacteria, and, 6, were, from, eukarya, taxonomic, classifications, to, genus, and, or, species, or, identification, were, possible, for, 1, 623, of, the, sequences, in, general, the, taxa, were, similar, to, organisms, previously, described, from, lakes, brackish, water, marine, environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake, sediments, deep, sea, sediments, deep, sea, thermal, vents, animals, and, plants, sequences, from, aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation, resistant, autotrophic, and, heterotrophic, organisms, were, present, including, a, number, from, multicellular, eukaryotes, in, 2020, colby, gura, and, scott, rogers, extended, their, study, of, lake, vostok, accretion, ice, as, well, as, the, basal, ice, flowing, into, the, lake, they, found, that, the, basal, ice, contained, an, almost, completely, different, community, of, organisms, compared, to, those, found, in, the, lake, accretion, ice, indicating, that, they, signified, two, completely, different, ecosystems, additional, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, were, reported, the, highest, diversity, of, organisms, in, the, lake, ice, was, significantly, associated, p, 0, 05, with, higher, concentrations, of, ions, and, amino, acids, while, their, previous, work, indicated, the, presence, of, bacteria, that, inhabit, fish, intestines, no, sequences, from, fish, were, found, however, in, the, 2020, study, they, found, an, rrna, sequence, that, was, 97, similar, to, that, from, a, rock, cod, common, along, the, coast, of, antarctica, notothenia, coriiceps, this, is, the, first, report, of, a, fish, species, possibly, residing, in, lake, vostok, the, fish, is, known, to, produce, antifreeze, proteins, microbiologist, david, pearce, of, the, university, of, northumbria, in, newcastle, uk, stated, that, the, dna, could, simply, be, contamination, from, the, drilling, process, and, not, representative, of, lake, vostok, itself, the, old, ice, cores, were, drilled, in, the, 1990s, to, look, for, evidence, of, past, climates, buried, in, the, ice, rather, than, for, life, so, the, drilling, equipment, was, not, sterilized, also, sergey, bulat, a, lake, vostok, expert, at, the, petersburg, nuclear, physics, institute, in, gatchina, russia, doubts, that, any, of, the, cells, or, dna, fragments, in, the, samples, would, belong, to, organisms, that, might, actually, exist, in, the, lake, he, says, that, it, is, very, probable, that, the, samples, are, heavily, contaminated, with, tissue, and, microbes, from, the, outside, world, the, contamination, possibility, has, been, refuted, by, scott, rogers, because, the, control, measures, were, rigorous, and, the, combinations, of, organisms, found, in, each, of, the, ice, samples, were, consistent, with, organisms, living, in, a, cold, lake, and, ice, including, a, sequence, from, an, antarctic, rock, cod, and, were, inconsistent, with, contamination, introduced, while, sampling, or, from, the, lab, procedures, also, all, of, the, lab, procedures, were, performed, in, parallel, with, ice, samples, from, lake, erie, and, the, two, resulting, data, sets, were, completely, different, the, lake, erie, sample, exhibited, many, signals, of, human, habitation, while, the, lake, vostok, ice, samples, exhibited, no, signals, of, human, habitation, the, lake, erie, sample, also, had, an, almost, completely, different, profile, of, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, phyla, russian, and, french, scientists, have, been, carrying, out, molecular, dna, studies, of, the, water, from, lake, vostok, that, was, frozen, in, the, borehole, by, constructing, numerous, dna, libraries, which, are, collections, of, fragments, of, dna, that, allow, scientists, to, identify, which, species, of, bacteria, they, may, belong, to, samples, taken, from, the, lake, so, far, contain, about, one, part, of, kerosene, per, 1000, of, water, and, they, are, contaminated, with, bacteria, previously, present, in, the, drill, bit, and, the, kerosene, drilling, fluid, so, far, the, scientists, have, been, able, to, identify, 255, contaminant, species, but, also, have, found, an, unknown, bacterium, when, they, initially, drilled, down, to, the, lake, s, surface, in, 2012, with, no, matches, in, any, international, databases, and, they, hope, it, may, be, a, unique, inhabitant, of, lake, vostok, however, vladimar, korolev, the, laboratory, head, of, the, study, at, the, same, institution, said, that, the, bacteria, could, in, principle, be, a, contaminant, that, uses, kerosene, the, antifreeze, used, during, drilling, as, an, energy, source, critics, from, the, scientific, community, state, that, no, valuable, information, can, be, obtained, until, they, can, test, clean, samples, of, lake, water, uncontaminated, by, drilling, fluid, regardless, of, the, contamination, issues, in, may, 2013, the, drilling, facility, at, the, russian, vostok, antarctic, station, was, declared, a, historic, monument, as, the, result, of, the, recognition, of, the, achievements, of, the, russian, research, of, antarctica, by, the, international, scientific, community, and, of, the, unique, operations, on, opening, the, subglacial, lake, vostok, performed, by, russian, scientists, on, february, 5, 2012, in, january, 2015, the, russian, press, stated, that, russian, scientists, have, made, a, new, clean, borehole, into, lake, vostok, using, a, special, 50, kilogram, probe, that, collected, about, 1, liter, of, water, not, adulterated, by, the, antifreezing, fluid, the, drilling, technology, used, proved, to, be, inappropriate, to, collect, liquid, water, in, general, and, clean, samples, in, particular, and, results, were, unreported, it, was, predicted, that, the, water, would, rise, 30, 40, m, in, the, bottom, part, of, the, borehole, but, in, fact, the, water, rose, from, the, lake, to, a, height, of, more, than, 500, m, in, october, of, that, same, year, the, work, was, suspended, for, that, southern, summer, because, of, insufficient, funding, by, the, federal, russian, government, in, 2019, the, russian, government, ordered, that, a, new, wintering, complex, be, installed, at, the, lake, vostok, research, station, funded, in, part, by, russian, billionaire, leonid, mikhelson, this, complex, will, be, capable, of, supporting, 35, people, in, the, summer, 15, in, the, winter, and, will, have, 4, diesel, generators, with, a, capacity, of, 200, kilowatts, each, the, new, complex, consisting, of, 133, modules, was, delivered, to, progress, station, in, december, 2021, and, will, be, transported, to, the, lake, vostok, research, station, and, installed, over, the, next, four, years, the, drilling, project, has, been, opposed, by, some, environmental, groups, and, scientists, who, have, argued, that, hot, water, drilling, would, have, a, more, limited, environmental, impact, the, main, concern, is, that, the, lake, could, become, contaminated, with, the, antifreeze, that, the, russians, used, to, keep, the, bore, hole, from, refreezing, scientists, of, the, united, states, national, research, council, have, taken, the, position, that, it, should, be, assumed, that, microbial, life, exists, in, lake, vostok, and, that, after, such, a, long, isolation, any, life, forms, in, the, lake, require, strict, protection, from, contamination, the, original, drilling, technique, employed, by, the, russians, involved, the, use, of, freon, and, kerosene, to, lubricate, the, borehole, and, prevent, it, from, collapsing, and, freezing, over, 60, short, tons, 54, t, of, these, chemicals, have, been, used, thus, far, on, the, ice, above, lake, vostok, other, countries, particularly, the, united, states, and, britain, have, failed, to, persuade, the, russians, not, to, pierce, to, the, lake, until, cleaner, technologies, such, as, hot, water, drilling, are, available, though, the, russians, claim, to, have, improved, their, operations, they, continue, to, use, the, same, borehole, which, has, already, been, contaminated, with, kerosene, according, to, the, head, of, russian, antarctic, expeditions, valery, lukin, new, equipment, was, developed, by, researchers, at, the, petersburg, nuclear, physics, institute, that, would, ensure, the, lake, remains, uncontaminated, upon, intrusion, lukin, has, repeatedly, reassured, other, signatory, nations, to, the, antarctic, treaty, system, that, the, drilling, will, not, affect, the, lake, arguing, that, on, breakthrough, water, will, rush, up, the, borehole, freeze, and, seal, the, other, fluids, out, some, environmentalist, groups, remain, unconvinced, by, these, arguments, the, antarctic, and, southern, ocean, coalition, has, argued, that, this, manner, of, drilling, is, a, profoundly, misguided, step, which, endangers, lake, vostok, and, other, subglacial, lakes, in, antarctica, which, some, scientists, are, convinced, are, inter, linked, with, lake, vostok, the,
