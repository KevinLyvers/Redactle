the, mercator, projection, m, r, k, e, t, r, is, a, conformal, cylindrical, map, projection, presented, by, flemish, geographer, and, cartographer, gerardus, mercator, in, 1569, it, became, the, standard, map, projection, for, navigation, due, to, its, ability, to, represent, north, as, up, and, south, as, down, everywhere, while, preserving, local, directions, and, shapes, however, as, a, result, the, mercator, projection, inflates, the, size, of, objects, the, further, they, are, from, the, equator, in, a, mercator, projection, landmasses, such, as, greenland, and, antarctica, appear, far, larger, than, they, actually, are, relative, to, landmasses, near, the, equator, despite, these, drawbacks, the, mercator, projection, is, well, suited, to, marine, navigation, and, internet, web, maps, and, continues, to, be, widely, used, today, joseph, needham, a, historian, of, china, speculated, that, some, star, charts, of, the, chinese, song, dynasty, may, have, been, based, on, the, mercator, projection, however, this, claim, was, presented, without, evidence, and, astronomical, historian, kazuhiko, miyajima, concluded, using, cartometric, analysis, that, these, charts, used, an, equirectangular, projection, instead, in, the, 13th, century, the, earliest, extant, portolan, charts, of, the, mediterranean, sea, which, are, generally, not, believed, to, be, based, on, any, particular, map, projection, but, which, have, a, closer, fit, to, the, mercator, projection, than, to, alternatives, included, windrose, networks, of, criss, crossing, lines, which, could, be, used, to, help, set, a, ship, s, bearing, in, sailing, between, locations, on, the, chart, the, region, of, the, earth, covered, by, such, charts, was, small, enough, that, a, course, of, constant, bearing, would, be, approximately, straight, on, the, chart, the, charts, have, startling, accuracy, not, found, in, the, maps, constructed, by, contemporary, european, or, arab, scholars, and, their, construction, remains, enigmatic, based, on, cartometric, analysis, which, seems, to, contradict, the, scholarly, consensus, they, have, been, speculated, to, have, originated, in, some, unknown, pre, medieval, cartographic, tradition, possibly, evidence, of, some, ancient, understanding, of, the, mercator, projection, german, polymath, erhard, etzlaub, engraved, miniature, compass, maps, about, 10, 8, cm, of, europe, and, parts, of, africa, that, spanned, latitudes, 0, 67, to, allow, adjustment, of, his, portable, pocket, size, sundials, the, projection, found, on, these, maps, dating, to, 1511, was, stated, by, john, snyder, in, 1987, to, be, the, same, projection, as, mercator, s, however, given, the, geometry, of, a, sundial, these, maps, may, well, have, been, based, on, the, similar, central, cylindrical, projection, a, limiting, case, of, the, gnomonic, projection, which, is, the, basis, for, a, sundial, snyder, amended, his, assessment, to, a, similar, projection, in, 1993, portuguese, mathematician, and, cosmographer, pedro, nunes, first, described, the, mathematical, principle, of, the, rhumb, line, or, loxodrome, a, path, with, constant, bearing, as, measured, relative, to, true, north, which, can, be, used, in, marine, navigation, to, pick, which, compass, bearing, to, follow, in, 1537, he, proposed, constructing, a, nautical, atlas, composed, of, several, large, scale, sheets, in, the, equirectangular, projection, as, a, way, to, minimize, distortion, of, directions, if, these, sheets, were, brought, to, the, same, scale, and, assembled, they, would, approximate, the, mercator, projection, in, 1541, flemish, geographer, and, cartographer, gerardus, mercator, included, a, network, of, rhumb, lines, on, a, terrestrial, globe, he, made, for, nicolas, perrenot, in, 1569, mercator, announced, a, new, projection, by, publishing, a, large, world, map, measuring, 202, by, 124, cm, 80, by, 49, in, and, printed, in, eighteen, separate, sheets, mercator, titled, the, map, nova, et, aucta, orbis, terrae, descriptio, ad, usum, navigantium, emendata, a, new, and, augmented, description, of, earth, corrected, for, the, use, of, sailors, this, title, along, with, an, elaborate, explanation, for, using, the, projection, that, appears, as, a, section, of, text, on, the, map, shows, that, mercator, understood, exactly, what, he, had, achieved, and, that, he, intended, the, projection, to, aid, navigation, mercator, never, explained, the, method, of, construction, or, how, he, arrived, at, it, various, hypotheses, have, been, tendered, over, the, years, but, in, any, case, mercator, s, friendship, with, pedro, nunes, and, his, access, to, the, loxodromic, tables, nunes, created, likely, aided, his, efforts, english, mathematician, edward, wright, published, the, first, accurate, tables, for, constructing, the, projection, in, 1599, and, in, more, detail, in, 1610, calling, his, treatise, certaine, errors, in, navigation, the, first, mathematical, formulation, was, publicized, around, 1645, by, a, mathematician, named, henry, bond, c, 1600, 1678, however, the, mathematics, involved, were, developed, but, never, published, by, mathematician, thomas, harriot, starting, around, 1589, the, development, of, the, mercator, projection, represented, a, major, breakthrough, in, the, nautical, cartography, of, the, 16th, century, however, it, was, much, ahead, of, its, time, since, the, old, navigational, and, surveying, techniques, were, not, compatible, with, its, use, in, navigation, two, main, problems, prevented, its, immediate, application, the, impossibility, of, determining, the, longitude, at, sea, with, adequate, accuracy, and, the, fact, that, magnetic, directions, instead, of, geographical, directions, were, used, in, navigation, only, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, after, the, marine, chronometer, was, invented, and, the, spatial, distribution, of, magnetic, declination, was, known, could, the, mercator, projection, be, fully, adopted, by, navigators, despite, those, position, finding, limitations, the, mercator, projection, can, be, found, in, many, world, maps, in, the, centuries, following, mercator, s, first, publication, however, it, did, not, begin, to, dominate, world, maps, until, the, 19th, century, when, the, problem, of, position, determination, had, been, largely, solved, once, the, mercator, became, the, usual, projection, for, commercial, and, educational, maps, it, came, under, persistent, criticism, from, cartographers, for, its, unbalanced, representation, of, landmasses, and, its, inability, to, usefully, show, the, polar, regions, the, criticisms, leveled, against, inappropriate, use, of, the, mercator, projection, resulted, in, a, flurry, of, new, inventions, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, often, directly, touted, as, alternatives, to, the, mercator, due, to, these, pressures, publishers, gradually, reduced, their, use, of, the, projection, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, however, the, advent, of, web, mapping, gave, the, projection, an, abrupt, resurgence, in, the, form, of, the, web, mercator, projection, today, the, mercator, can, be, found, in, marine, charts, occasional, world, maps, and, web, mapping, services, but, commercial, atlases, have, largely, abandoned, it, and, wall, maps, of, the, world, can, be, found, in, many, alternative, projections, google, maps, which, relied, on, it, since, 2005, still, uses, it, for, local, area, maps, but, dropped, the, projection, from, desktop, platforms, in, 2017, for, maps, that, are, zoomed, out, of, local, areas, many, other, online, mapping, services, still, exclusively, use, the, web, mercator, the, mercator, projection, can, be, visualized, as, the, result, of, wrapping, a, cylinder, tightly, around, a, sphere, with, the, two, surfaces, tangent, to, touching, each, other, along, a, circle, halfway, between, the, poles, of, their, common, axis, and, then, conformally, unfolding, the, surface, of, the, sphere, outward, onto, the, cylinder, meaning, that, at, each, point, the, projection, uniformly, scales, the, image, of, a, small, portion, of, the, spherical, surface, without, otherwise, distorting, it, preserving, angles, between, intersecting, curves, afterward, this, cylinder, is, unrolled, onto, a, flat, plane, to, make, a, map, in, this, interpretation, the, scale, of, the, surface, is, preserved, exactly, along, the, circle, where, the, cylinder, touches, the, sphere, but, increases, nonlinearly, for, points, further, from, the, contact, circle, however, by, uniformly, shrinking, the, resulting, flat, map, as, a, final, step, any, pair, of, circles, parallel, to, and, equidistant, from, the, contact, circle, can, be, chosen, to, have, their, scale, preserved, called, the, standard, parallels, then, the, region, between, chosen, circles, will, have, its, scale, smaller, than, on, the, sphere, reaching, a, minimum, at, the, contact, circle, this, is, sometimes, visualized, as, a, projection, onto, a, cylinder, which, is, secant, to, cuts, the, sphere, though, this, picture, is, misleading, insofar, as, the, standard, parallels, are, not, spaced, the, same, distance, apart, on, the, map, as, the, shortest, distance, between, them, through, the, interior, of, the, sphere, the, original, and, most, common, aspect, of, the, mercator, projection, for, maps, of, the, earth, is, the, normal, aspect, for, which, the, axis, of, the, cylinder, is, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, which, passes, through, the, north, and, south, poles, and, the, contact, circle, is, the, earth, s, equator, as, for, all, cylindrical, projections, in, normal, aspect, circles, of, latitude, and, meridians, of, longitude, are, straight, and, perpendicular, to, each, other, on, the, map, forming, a, grid, of, rectangles, while, circles, of, latitude, on, the, earth, are, smaller, the, closer, they, are, to, the, poles, they, are, stretched, in, an, east, west, direction, to, have, uniform, length, on, any, cylindrical, map, projection, among, cylindrical, projections, the, mercator, projection, is, the, unique, projection, which, balances, this, east, west, stretching, by, a, precisely, corresponding, north, south, stretching, so, that, at, every, location, the, scale, is, locally, uniform, and, angles, are, preserved, the, mercator, projection, in, normal, aspect, maps, trajectories, of, constant, bearing, called, rhumb, lines, or, loxodromes, on, a, sphere, to, straight, lines, on, the, map, and, is, thus, uniquely, suited, to, marine, navigation, courses, and, bearings, are, measured, using, a, compass, rose, or, protractor, and, the, corresponding, directions, are, easily, transferred, from, point, to, point, on, the, map, e, g, with, the, help, of, a, parallel, ruler, because, the, linear, scale, of, a, mercator, map, in, normal, aspect, increases, with, latitude, it, distorts, the, size, of, geographical, objects, far, from, the, equator, and, conveys, a, distorted, perception, of, the, overall, geometry, of, the, planet, at, latitudes, greater, than, 70, north, or, south, the, mercator, projection, is, practically, unusable, because, the, linear, scale, becomes, infinitely, large, at, the, poles, a, mercator, map, can, therefore, never, fully, show, the, polar, areas, but, see, uses, below, for, applications, of, the, oblique, and, transverse, mercator, projections, the, mercator, projection, is, often, compared, to, and, confused, with, the, central, cylindrical, projection, which, is, the, result, of, projecting, points, from, the, sphere, onto, a, tangent, cylinder, along, straight, radial, lines, as, if, from, a, light, source, placed, at, the, earth, s, center, both, have, extreme, distortion, far, from, the, equator, and, cannot, show, the, poles, however, they, are, different, projections, and, have, different, properties, as, with, all, map, projections, the, shapes, or, sizes, are, distortions, of, the, true, layout, of, the, earth, s, surface, the, mercator, projection, exaggerates, areas, far, from, the, equator, the, closer, to, the, poles, of, the, earth, the, greater, the, distortion, because, of, great, land, area, distortions, critics, like, george, kellaway, and, irving, fisher, consider, the, projection, unsuitable, for, general, world, maps, it, has, been, conjectured, to, have, influenced, people, s, views, of, the, world, because, it, shows, countries, near, the, equator, as, too, small, when, compared, to, those, of, europe, and, north, america, it, has, been, supposed, to, cause, people, to, consider, those, countries, as, less, important, mercator, himself, used, the, equal, area, sinusoidal, projection, to, show, relative, areas, however, despite, such, criticisms, the, mercator, projection, was, especially, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, perhaps, the, most, common, projection, used, in, world, maps, atlases, largely, stopped, using, the, mercator, projection, for, world, maps, or, for, areas, distant, from, the, equator, in, the, 1940s, preferring, other, cylindrical, projections, or, forms, of, equal, area, projection, the, mercator, projection, is, however, still, commonly, used, for, areas, near, the, equator, where, distortion, is, minimal, it, is, also, frequently, found, in, maps, of, time, zones, arno, peters, stirred, controversy, beginning, in, 1972, when, he, proposed, what, is, now, usually, called, the, gall, peters, projection, to, remedy, the, problems, of, the, mercator, claiming, it, to, be, his, own, original, work, without, referencing, prior, work, by, cartographers, such, as, gall, s, work, from, 1855, the, projection, he, promoted, is, a, specific, parameterization, of, the, cylindrical, equal, area, projection, in, response, a, 1989, resolution, by, seven, north, american, geographical, groups, disparaged, using, cylindrical, projections, for, general, purpose, world, maps, which, would, include, both, the, mercator, and, the, gall, peters, practically, every, marine, chart, in, print, is, based, on, the, mercator, projection, due, to, its, uniquely, favorable, properties, for, navigation, it, is, also, commonly, used, by, street, map, services, hosted, on, the, internet, due, to, its, uniquely, favorable, properties, for, local, area, maps, computed, on, demand, mercator, projections, were, also, important, in, the, mathematical, development, of, plate, tectonics, in, the, 1960s, the, mercator, projection, was, designed, for, use, in, marine, navigation, because, of, its, unique, property, of, representing, any, course, of, constant, bearing, as, a, straight, segment, such, a, course, known, as, a, rhumb, alternately, called, a, rhumb, line, or, loxodrome, is, preferred, in, marine, navigation, because, ships, can, sail, in, a, constant, compass, direction, this, reduces, the, difficult, error, prone, course, corrections, that, otherwise, would, be, necessary, when, sailing, a, different, course, for, small, distances, compared, to, the, radius, of, the, earth, the, difference, between, the, rhumb, and, the, great, circle, course, is, negligible, even, for, longer, distances, the, simplicity, of, the, constant, bearing, makes, it, attractive, as, observed, by, mercator, on, such, a, course, the, ship, would, not, arrive, by, the, shortest, route, but, it, will, surely, arrive, sailing, a, rhumb, meant, that, all, that, the, sailors, had, to, do, was, keep, a, constant, course, as, long, as, they, knew, where, they, were, when, they, started, where, they, intended, to, be, when, they, finished, and, had, a, map, in, mercator, projection, that, correctly, showed, those, two, coordinates, many, major, online, street, mapping, services, bing, maps, google, maps, mapbox, mapquest, openstreetmap, yahoo, maps, and, others, use, a, variant, of, the, mercator, projection, for, their, map, images, called, web, mercator, or, google, web, mercator, despite, its, obvious, scale, variation, at, the, world, level, small, scales, the, projection, is, well, suited, as, an, interactive, world, map, that, can, be, zoomed, seamlessly, to, local, large, scale, maps, where, there, is, relatively, little, distortion, due, to, the, variant, projection, s, near, conformality, the, major, online, street, mapping, services, tiling, systems, display, most, of, the, world, at, the, lowest, zoom, level, as, a, single, square, image, excluding, the, polar, regions, by, truncation, at, latitudes, of, max, 85, 05113, see, below, latitude, values, outside, this, range, are, mapped, using, a, different, relationship, that, does, not, diverge, at, 90, a, transverse, mercator, projection, tilts, the, cylinder, axis, so, that, it, is, perpendicular, to, earth, s, axis, the, tangent, standard, line, then, coincides, with, a, meridian, and, its, opposite, meridian, giving, a, constant, scale, factor, along, those, meridians, and, making, the, projection, useful, for, mapping, regions, that, are, predominately, north, south, in, extent, in, its, more, complex, ellipsoidal, form, most, national, grid, systems, around, the, world, use, the, transverse, mercator, as, does, the, universal, transverse, mercator, coordinate, system, an, oblique, mercator, projection, tilts, the, cylinder, axis, away, from, the, earth, s, axis, to, an, angle, of, one, s, choosing, so, that, its, tangent, or, secant, lines, of, contact, are, circles, that, are, also, tilted, relative, to, the, earth, s, parallels, of, latitude, practical, uses, for, the, oblique, projection, such, as, national, grid, systems, use, ellipsoidal, developments, of, the, oblique, mercator, in, order, to, keep, scale, variation, low, along, the, surface, projection, of, the, cylinder, s, axis, although, the, surface, of, earth, is, best, modelled, by, an, oblate, ellipsoid, of, revolution, for, small, scale, maps, the, ellipsoid, is, approximated, by, a, sphere, of, radius, a, where, a, is, approximately, 6, 371, km, this, spherical, approximation, of, earth, can, be, modelled, by, a, smaller, sphere, of, radius, r, called, the, globe, in, this, section, the, globe, determines, the, scale, of, the, map, the, various, cylindrical, projections, specify, how, the, geographic, detail, is, transferred, from, the, globe, to, a, cylinder, tangential, to, it, at, the, equator, the, cylinder, is, then, unrolled, to, give, the, planar, map, the, fraction, r, a, is, called, the, representative, fraction, rf, or, the, principal, scale, of, the, projection, for, example, a, mercator, map, printed, in, a, book, might, have, an, equatorial, width, of, 13, 4, cm, corresponding, to, a, globe, radius, of, 2, 13, cm, and, an, rf, of, approximately, 1, 300m, m, is, used, as, an, abbreviation, for, 1, 000, 000, in, writing, an, rf, whereas, mercator, s, original, 1569, map, has, a, width, of, 198, cm, corresponding, to, a, globe, radius, of, 31, 5, cm, and, an, rf, of, about, 1, 20m, a, cylindrical, map, projection, is, specified, by, formulae, linking, the, geographic, coordinates, of, latitude, and, longitude, to, cartesian, coordinates, on, the, map, with, origin, on, the, equator, and, x, axis, along, the, equator, by, construction, all, points, on, the, same, meridian, lie, on, the, same, generator, of, the, cylinder, at, a, constant, value, of, x, but, the, distance, y, along, the, generator, measured, from, the, equator, is, an, arbitrary, function, of, latitude, y, in, general, this, function, does, not, describe, the, geometrical, projection, as, of, light, rays, onto, a, screen, from, the, centre, of, the, globe, to, the, cylinder, which, is, only, one, of, an, unlimited, number, of, ways, to, conceptually, project, a, cylindrical, map, since, the, cylinder, is, tangential, to, the, globe, at, the, equator, the, scale, factor, between, globe, and, cylinder, is, unity, on, the, equator, but, nowhere, else, in, particular, since, the, radius, of, a, parallel, or, circle, of, latitude, is, r, cos, the, corresponding, parallel, on, the, map, must, have, been, stretched, by, a, factor, of, 1, cos, sec, this, scale, factor, on, the, parallel, is, conventionally, denoted, by, k, and, the, corresponding, scale, factor, on, the, meridian, is, denoted, by, h, the, mercator, projection, is, conformal, one, implication, of, that, is, the, isotropy, of, scale, factors, which, means, that, the, point, scale, factor, is, independent, of, direction, so, that, small, shapes, are, preserved, by, the, projection, this, implies, that, the, vertical, scale, factor, h, equals, the, horizontal, scale, factor, k, since, k, sec, so, must, h, the, graph, shows, the, variation, of, this, scale, factor, with, latitude, some, numerical, values, are, listed, below, the, area, scale, factor, is, the, product, of, the, parallel, and, meridian, scales, hk, sec, 2, for, greenland, taking, 73, as, a, median, latitude, hk, 11, 7, for, australia, taking, 25, as, a, median, latitude, hk, 1, 2, for, great, britain, taking, 55, as, a, median, latitude, hk, 3, 04, the, variation, with, latitude, is, sometimes, indicated, by, multiple, bar, scales, as, shown, below, the, classic, way, of, showing, the, distortion, inherent, in, a, projection, is, to, use, tissot, s, indicatrix, nicolas, tissot, noted, that, the, scale, factors, at, a, point, on, a, map, projection, specified, by, the, numbers, h, and, k, define, an, ellipse, at, that, point, for, cylindrical, projections, the, axes, of, the, ellipse, are, aligned, to, the, meridians, and, parallels, for, the, mercator, projection, h, k, so, the, ellipses, degenerate, into, circles, with, radius, proportional, to, the, value, of, the, scale, factor, for, that, latitude, these, circles, are, rendered, on, the, projected, map, with, extreme, variation, in, size, indicative, of, mercator, s, scale, variations, as, discussed, above, the, isotropy, condition, implies, that, h, k, sec, consider, a, point, on, the, globe, of, radius, r, with, longitude, and, latitude, if, is, increased, by, an, infinitesimal, amount, d, the, point, moves, r, d, along, a, meridian, of, the, globe, of, radius, r, so, the, corresponding, change, in, y, dy, must, be, hr, d, r, sec, d, therefore, y, r, sec, similarly, increasing, by, d, moves, the, point, r, cos, d, along, a, parallel, of, the, globe, so, dx, kr, cos, d, r, d, that, is, x, r, integrating, the, equations, with, x, 0, 0, and, y, 0, 0, gives, x, and, y, the, value, 0, is, the, longitude, of, an, arbitrary, central, meridian, that, is, usually, but, not, always, that, of, greenwich, i, e, zero, the, angles, and, are, expressed, in, radians, by, the, integral, of, the, secant, function, the, function, y, is, plotted, alongside, for, the, case, r, 1, it, tends, to, infinity, at, the, poles, the, linear, y, axis, values, are, not, usually, shown, on, printed, maps, instead, some, maps, show, the, non, linear, scale, of, latitude, values, on, the, right, more, often, than, not, the, maps, show, only, a, graticule, of, selected, meridians, and, parallels, the, expression, on, the, right, of, the, second, equation, defines, the, gudermannian, function, i, e, gd, y, r, the, direct, equation, may, therefore, be, written, as, y, r, gd, 1, there, are, many, alternative, expressions, for, y, all, derived, by, elementary, manipulations, corresponding, inverses, are, for, angles, expressed, in, degrees, the, above, formulae, are, written, in, terms, of, the, globe, radius, r, it, is, often, convenient, to, work, directly, with, the, map, width, w, 2, r, for, example, the, basic, transformation, equations, become, the, ordinate, y, of, the, mercator, projection, becomes, infinite, at, the, poles, and, the, map, must, be, truncated, at, some, latitude, less, than, ninety, degrees, this, need, not, be, done, symmetrically, mercator, s, original, map, is, truncated, at, 80, n, and, 66, s, with, the, result, that, european, countries, were, moved, toward, the, centre, of, the, map, the, aspect, ratio, of, his, map, is, 198, 120, 1, 65, even, more, extreme, truncations, have, been, used, a, finnish, school, atlas, was, truncated, at, approximately, 76, n, and, 56, s, an, aspect, ratio, of, 1, 97, much, web, based, mapping, uses, a, zoomable, version, of, the, mercator, projection, with, an, aspect, ratio, of, one, in, this, case, the, maximum, latitude, attained, must, correspond, to, y, w, 2, or, equivalently, y, r, any, of, the, inverse, transformation, formulae, may, be, used, to, calculate, the, corresponding, latitudes, the, relations, between, y, and, properties, of, the, projection, such, as, the, transformation, of, angles, and, the, variation, in, scale, follow, from, the, geometry, of, corresponding, small, elements, on, the, globe, and, map, the, figure, below, shows, a, point, p, at, latitude, and, longitude, on, the, globe, and, a, nearby, point, q, at, latitude, and, longitude, the, vertical, lines, pk, and, mq, are, arcs, of, meridians, of, length, r, the, horizontal, lines, pm, and, kq, are, arcs, of, parallels, of, length, r, cos, the, corresponding, points, on, the, projection, define, a, rectangle, of, width, x, and, height, y, for, small, elements, the, angle, pkq, is, approximately, a, right, angle, and, therefore, the, previously, mentioned, scaling, factors, from, globe, to, cylinder, are, given, by, since, the, meridians, are, mapped, to, lines, of, constant, x, we, must, have, x, r, 0, and, x, r, in, radians, therefore, in, the, limit, of, infinitesimally, small, elements, in, the, case, of, the, mercator, projection, y, r, sec, so, this, gives, us, h, k, and, the, fact, that, h, k, is, the, isotropy, of, scale, factors, discussed, above, the, fact, that, reflects, another, implication, of, the, mapping, being, conformal, namely, the, fact, that, a, sailing, course, of, constant, azimuth, on, the, globe, is, mapped, into, the, same, constant, grid, bearing, on, the, map, converting, ruler, distance, on, the, mercator, map, into, true, great, circle, distance, on, the, sphere, is, straightforward, along, the, equator, but, nowhere, else, one, problem, is, the, variation, of, scale, with, latitude, and, another, is, that, straight, lines, on, the, map, rhumb, lines, other, than, the, meridians, or, the, equator, do, not, correspond, to, great, circles, the, distinction, between, rhumb, sailing, distance, and, great, circle, true, distance, was, clearly, understood, by, mercator, see, legend, 12, on, the, 1569, map, he, stressed, that, the, rhumb, line, distance, is, an, acceptable, approximation, for, true, great, circle, distance, for, courses, of, short, or, moderate, distance, particularly, at, lower, latitudes, he, even, quantifies, his, statement, when, the, great, circle, distances, which, are, to, be, measured, in, the, vicinity, of, the, equator, do, not, exceed, 20, degrees, of, a, great, circle, or, 15, degrees, near, spain, and, france, or, 8, and, even, 10, degrees, in, northern, parts, it, is, convenient, to, use, rhumb, line, distances, for, a, ruler, measurement, of, a, short, line, with, midpoint, at, latitude, where, the, scale, factor, is, k, sec, 1, cos, with, radius, and, great, circle, circumference, equal, to, 6, 371, km, and, 40, 030, km, respectively, an, rf, of, 1, 300m, for, which, r, 2, 12, cm, and, w, 13, 34, cm, implies, that, a, ruler, measurement, of, 3, mm, in, any, direction, from, a, point, on, the, equator, corresponds, to, approximately, 900, km, the, corresponding, distances, for, latitudes, 20, 40, 60, and, 80, are, 846, km, 689, km, 450, km, and, 156, km, respectively, longer, distances, require, various, approaches, scale, is, unity, on, the, equator, for, a, non, secant, projection, therefore, interpreting, ruler, measurements, on, the, equator, is, simple, for, the, above, model, with, rf, 1, 300m, 1, cm, corresponds, to, 3, 000, km, on, any, other, parallel, the, scale, factor, is, sec, so, that, for, the, above, model, 1, cm, corresponds, to, 1, 500, km, at, a, latitude, of, 60, this, is, not, the, shortest, distance, between, the, chosen, endpoints, on, the, parallel, because, a, parallel, is, not, a, great, circle, the, difference, is, small, for, short, distances, but, increases, as, the, longitudinal, separation, increases, for, two, points, a, and, b, separated, by, 10, of, longitude, on, the, parallel, at, 60, the, distance, along, the, parallel, is, approximately, 0, 5, km, greater, than, the, great, circle, distance, the, distance, ab, along, the, parallel, is, a, cos, the, length, of, the, chord, ab, is, 2, a, cos, sin, 2, this, chord, subtends, an, angle, at, the, centre, equal, to, 2arcsin, cos, sin, 2, and, the, great, circle, distance, between, a, and, b, is, 2, a, arcsin, cos, sin, 2, in, the, extreme, case, where, the, longitudinal, separation, is, 180, the, distance, along, the, parallel, is, one, half, of, the, circumference, of, that, parallel, i, e, 10, 007, 5, km, on, the, other, hand, the, geodesic, between, these, points, is, a, great, circle, arc, through, the, pole, subtending, an, angle, of, 60, at, the, center, the, length, of, this, arc, is, one, sixth, of, the, great, circle, circumference, about, 6, 672, km, the, difference, is, 3, 338, km, so, the, ruler, distance, measured, from, the, map, is, quite, misleading, even, after, correcting, for, the, latitude, variation, of, the, scale, factor, a, meridian, of, the, map, is, a, great, circle, on, the, globe, but, the, continuous, scale, variation, means, ruler, measurement, alone, cannot, yield, the, true, distance, between, distant, points, on, the, meridian, however, if, the, map, is, marked, with, an, accurate, and, finely, spaced, latitude, scale, from, which, the, latitude, may, be, read, directly, as, is, the, case, for, the, mercator, 1569, world, map, sheets, 3, 9, 15, and, all, subsequent, nautical, charts, the, meridian, distance, between, two, latitudes, 1, and, 2, is, simply, if, the, latitudes, of, the, end, points, cannot, be, determined, with, confidence, then, they, can, be, found, instead, by, calculation, on, the, ruler, distance, calling, the, ruler, distances, of, the, end, points, on, the, map, meridian, as, measured, from, the, equator, y, 1, and, y, 2, the, true, distance, between, these, points, on, the, sphere, is, given, by, using, any, one, of, the, inverse, mercator, formulae, where, r, may, be, calculated, from, the, width, w, of, the, map, by, r, w, 2, for, example, on, a, map, with, r, 1, the, values, of, y, 0, 1, 2, 3, correspond, to, latitudes, of, 0, 50, 75, 84, and, therefore, the, successive, intervals, of, 1, cm, on, the, map, correspond, to, latitude, intervals, on, the, globe, of, 50, 25, 9, and, distances, of, 5, 560, km, 2, 780, km, and, 1, 000, km, on, the, earth, a, straight, line, on, the, mercator, map, at, angle, to, the, meridians, is, a, rhumb, line, when, 2, or, 3, 2, the, rhumb, corresponds, to, one, of, the, parallels, only, one, the, equator, is, a, great, circle, when, 0, or, it, corresponds, to, a, meridian, great, circle, if, continued, around, the, earth, for, all, other, values, it, is, a, spiral, from, pole, to, pole, on, the, globe, intersecting, all, meridians, at, the, same, angle, and, is, thus, not, a, great, circle, this, section, discusses, only, the, last, of, these, cases, if, is, neither, 0, nor, then, the, above, figure, of, the, infinitesimal, elements, shows, that, the, length, of, an, infinitesimal, rhumb, line, on, the, sphere, between, latitudes, and, is, a, sec, since, is, constant, on, the, rhumb, this, expression, can, be, integrated, to, give, for, finite, rhumb, lines, on, the, earth, once, again, if, may, be, read, directly, from, an, accurate, latitude, scale, on, the, map, then, the, rhumb, distance, between, map, points, with, latitudes, 1, and, 2, is, given, by, the, above, if, there, is, no, such, scale, then, the, ruler, distances, between, the, end, points, and, the, equator, y, 1, and, y, 2, give, the, result, via, an, inverse, formula, these, formulae, give, rhumb, distances, on, the, sphere, which, may, differ, greatly, from, true, distances, whose, determination, requires, more, sophisticated, calculations, when, the, earth, is, modelled, by, a, spheroid, ellipsoid, of, revolution, the, mercator, projection, must, be, modified, if, it, is, to, remain, conformal, the, transformation, equations, and, scale, factor, for, the, non, secant, version, are, x, r, 0, y, r, ln, tan, 4, 2, 1, e, sin, 1, e, sin, e, 2, r, sinh, 1, tan, e, tanh, 1, e, sin, k, sec, 1, e, 2, sin, 2, displaystyle, begin, aligned, x, r, left, lambda, lambda, 0, right, y, r, ln, left, r, left, sinh, 1, left, tan, varphi, right, e, tanh, 1, e, sin, varphi, right, k, sec, varphi, sqrt, 1, e, 2, sin, 2, varphi, end, aligned, the, scale, factor, is, unity, on, the, equator, as, it, must, be, since, the, cylinder, is, tangential, to, the, ellipsoid, at, the, equator, the, ellipsoidal, correction, of, the, scale, factor, increases, with, latitude, but, it, is, never, greater, than, e, 2, a, correction, of, less, than, 1, the, value, of, e, 2, is, about, 0, 006, for, all, reference, ellipsoids, this, is, much, smaller, than, the, scale, inaccuracy, except, very, close, to, the, equator, only, accurate, mercator, projections, of, regions, near, the, equator, will, necessitate, the, ellipsoidal, corrections, the, inverse, is, solved, iteratively, as, the, isometric, latitude, is, involved
