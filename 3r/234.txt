portugal, for, a, new, life, on, the, islands, a, better, one, they, hoped, than, was, possible, in, a, portugal, which, had, been, ravaged, by, the, black, death, and, where, the, best, farmlands, were, strictly, controlled, by, the, nobility, to, have, minimum, conditions, for, the, development, of, agriculture, on, the, island, the, settlers, had, to, chop, down, part, of, the, dense, forest, and, build, a, large, number, of, water, channels, called, levadas, to, carry, the, abundant, waters, on, the, north, coast, to, the, south, coast, of, the, island, initially, the, settlers, produced,

production, began, to, fall, and, the, ensuing, crisis, forced, henry, the, navigator, to, order, other, commercial, crops, to, be, planted, so, that, the, islands, could, be, profitable, these, specialised, plants, and, their, associated, industrial, technology, created, one, of, the, major, revolutions, on, the, islands, and, fuelled, portuguese, industry, following, the, introduction, of, the, first, water, driven, sugar, mill, on, madeira, sugar, production, increased, to, over, 6, 000, arrobas, an, arroba, was, equal, to, 11, to, 12, kilograms, or, 24, to, 26, pounds, by, 1455, using, advisers, from, sicily, and, financed, by, genoese, capital, genoa, acted, as, an, integral, part, of, the, island, economy, until, the, 17th, century, the, accessibility, of, madeira, attracted, genoese, and, flemish, traders, who, were, keen, to, bypass, venetian, monopolies, by, 1480, antwerp, had, some, seventy, ships, engaged, in, the, madeira, sugar, trade, with, the, refining, and, distribution, concentrated, in, antwerp, by, the, 1490s, madeira, had, overtaken, cyprus, as, a, producer, of, sugar, sugarcane, production, was, the, primary, engine, of, the, island, s, economy, which, quickly, afforded, the, funchal, metropolis, economic, prosperity, the, production, of, sugar, cane, attracted, adventurers, and, merchants, from, all, parts, of, europe, especially, italians, basques, catalans, and, flemish, this, meant, that, in, the, second, half, of, the, fifteenth, century, the, city, of, funchal, became, a, mandatory, port, of, call, for,

communities, throughout, the, mediterranean, region, captured, 1, 200, people, in, porto, santo, in, 1617, until, the, first, half, of, the, sixteenth, century, madeira, was, one, of, the, major, sugar, markets, of, the, atlantic, apparently, it, is, in, madeira, that, in, the, context, of, sugar, production, slave, labour, was, applied, for, the, first, time, the, colonial, system, of, sugar, production, was, put, into, practice, on, the, island, of, madeira, on, a, much, smaller, scale, and, later, transferred, on, a, large, scale, to, other, overseas, production, areas, later, on, this, small, scale, of, production, was, outmatched, by, brazilian, and, s, o, tomean, plantations, madeiran, sugar, production, declined, in, such, a, way, that, it, was, not, enough, for, domestic, needs, so, that, sugar, was, imported, to, the, island, from, other, portuguese, colonies, sugar, mills, were, gradually, abandoned, with, few, remaining, which, gave, way, to, other, markets, in, madeira, in, the, 17th, century, as, portuguese, sugar, production, was, shifted, to, brazil, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, and, elsewhere, madeira, s, most, important, commodity, product, became, its, wine, sugar, plantations, were, replaced, by, vineyards, originating, in, the, so, called, wine, culture, which, acquired, international, fame, and, provided, the, rise, of, a, new, social, class, the,
