the, americas, sometimes, collectively, called, america, are, a, landmass, comprising, the, totality, of, north, america, and, south, america, the, americas, make, up, most, of, the, land, in, earth, s, western, hemisphere, and, comprise, the, new, world, along, with, their, associated, islands, the, americas, cover, 8, of, earth, s, total, surface, area, and, 28, 4, of, its, land, area, the, topography, is, dominated, by, the, american, cordillera, a, long, chain, of, mountains, that, runs, the, length, of, the, west, coast, the, flatter, eastern, side, of, the, americas, is, dominated, by, large, river, basins, such, as, the, amazon, st, lawrence, river, great, lakes, mississippi, and, la, plata, basins, since, the, americas, extend, 14, 000, km, 8, 700, mi, from, north, to, south, the, climate, and, ecology, vary, widely, from, the, arctic, tundra, of, northern, canada, greenland, and, alaska, to, the, tropical, rainforests, in, central, america, and, south, america, humans, first, settled, the, americas, from, asia, between, 20, 000, and, 16, 000, years, ago, a, second, migration, of, na, dene, speakers, followed, later, from, asia, the, subsequent, migration, of, the, inuit, into, the, neoarctic, around, 3500, bce, completed, what, is, generally, regarded, as, the, settlement, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, first, known, european, settlement, in, the, americas, was, by, the, norse, explorer, leif, erikson, however, the, colonization, never, became, permanent, and, was, later, abandoned, the, spanish, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, from, 1492, to, 1504, resulted, in, permanent, contact, with, european, and, subsequently, other, old, world, powers, which, eventually, led, to, the, columbian, exchange, and, inaugurated, a, period, of, exploration, conquest, and, colonization, whose, effects, and, consequences, persist, to, the, present, the, spanish, presence, involved, the, enslavement, of, large, numbers, of, the, indigenous, population, of, america, diseases, introduced, from, europe, and, west, africa, devastated, the, indigenous, peoples, and, the, european, powers, colonized, the, americas, mass, emigration, from, europe, including, large, numbers, of, indentured, servants, and, importation, of, african, slaves, largely, replaced, the, indigenous, peoples, in, much, of, the, americas, decolonization, of, the, americas, began, with, the, american, revolution, in, the, 1770s, and, largely, ended, with, the, spanish, american, war, in, the, late, 1890s, currently, almost, all, of, the, population, of, the, americas, resides, in, independent, countries, however, the, legacy, of, the, colonization, and, settlement, by, europeans, is, that, the, americas, share, many, common, cultural, traits, most, notably, christianity, and, the, use, of, west, european, languages, primarily, spanish, english, portuguese, french, and, to, a, lesser, extent, dutch, the, americas, are, home, to, more, than, a, billion, inhabitants, two, thirds, of, whom, reside, in, the, united, states, brazil, and, mexico, it, is, home, to, eight, megacities, metropolitan, areas, with, ten, million, inhabitants, or, more, greater, mexico, city, 21, 2, million, s, o, paulo, 21, 2, million, new, york, city, 19, 7, million, los, angeles, 18, 8, million, buenos, aires, 15, 6, million, rio, de, janeiro, 13, 0, million, bogot, 10, 4, million, and, lima, 10, 1, million, the, name, america, was, first, recorded, in, 1507, a, two, dimensional, globe, created, by, martin, waldseem, ller, was, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, the, term, the, name, was, also, used, together, with, the, related, term, amerigen, in, the, cosmographiae, introductio, apparently, written, by, matthias, ringmann, in, reference, to, south, america, it, was, applied, to, both, north, and, south, america, by, gerardus, mercator, in, 1538, america, derives, from, americus, the, latin, version, of, italian, explorer, amerigo, vespucci, s, first, name, the, feminine, form, america, was, originally, used, to, refer, to, the, newly, discovered, continent, which, is, why, it, was, accorded, with, the, feminine, names, of, the, other, continents, asia, africa, and, europa, since, the, 1950s, however, north, america, and, south, america, have, generally, been, considered, by, english, speakers, as, separate, continents, and, taken, together, are, called, the, americas, or, more, rarely, america, when, conceived, as, a, unitary, continent, the, form, is, generally, the, continent, of, america, in, the, singular, however, without, a, clarifying, context, singular, america, in, english, commonly, refers, to, the, united, states, of, america, the, pre, columbian, era, incorporates, all, period, subdivisions, in, the, history, and, prehistory, of, the, americas, before, the, appearance, of, significant, european, influences, on, the, american, continents, spanning, the, time, of, the, original, settlement, in, the, upper, paleolithic, to, european, colonization, during, the, early, modern, period, the, term, pre, columbian, is, used, especially, often, in, the, context, of, the, great, indigenous, civilizations, of, the, americas, such, as, those, of, mesoamerica, olmec, toltec, teotihuacano, zapotec, mixtec, aztec, maya, and, the, andean, civilizations, inca, moche, chav, n, muisca, ca, ari, many, pre, columbian, civilizations, established, characteristics, and, hallmarks, which, included, permanent, or, urban, settlements, agriculture, civic, and, monumental, architecture, and, complex, societal, hierarchies, some, of, these, civilizations, had, long, faded, by, the, time, of, the, first, permanent, european, arrivals, c, late, 15th, early, 16th, centuries, and, are, known, only, through, archeological, investigations, others, were, contemporary, with, this, period, and, are, also, known, from, historical, accounts, of, the, time, a, few, such, as, the, maya, had, their, own, written, records, however, most, europeans, of, the, time, viewed, such, texts, as, pagan, and, much, was, destroyed, in, christian, pyres, only, a, few, hidden, documents, remain, today, leaving, modern, historians, with, glimpses, of, ancient, culture, and, knowledge, the, first, inhabitants, migrated, into, the, americas, from, asia, habitation, sites, are, known, in, alaska, and, yukon, from, at, least, 20, 000, years, ago, with, suggested, ages, of, up, to, 40, 000, years, beyond, that, the, specifics, of, the, paleo, indian, migration, to, and, throughout, the, americas, including, the, dates, and, routes, traveled, are, subject, to, ongoing, research, and, discussion, widespread, habitation, of, the, americas, occurred, after, the, late, glacial, maximum, from, 16, 000, to, 13, 000, years, ago, the, traditional, theory, has, been, that, these, early, migrants, moved, into, the, beringia, land, bridge, between, eastern, siberia, and, present, day, alaska, around, 40, 000, 17, 000, years, ago, when, sea, levels, were, significantly, lowered, during, the, quaternary, glaciation, these, people, are, believed, to, have, followed, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, primitive, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, evidence, of, the, latter, would, since, have, been, covered, by, a, sea, level, rise, of, hundreds, of, meters, following, the, last, ice, age, both, routes, may, have, been, taken, although, the, genetic, evidences, suggests, a, single, founding, population, the, micro, satellite, diversity, and, distributions, specific, to, south, american, indigenous, peoples, indicates, that, certain, populations, have, been, isolated, since, the, initial, colonization, of, the, region, a, second, migration, occurred, after, the, initial, peopling, of, the, americas, na, dene, speakers, found, predominantly, in, north, american, groups, at, varying, genetic, rates, with, the, highest, frequency, found, among, the, athabaskans, at, 42, derive, from, this, second, wave, linguists, and, biologists, have, reached, a, similar, conclusion, based, on, analysis, of, amerindian, language, groups, and, abo, blood, group, system, distributions, then, the, people, of, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, a, broad, cultural, entity, that, developed, along, the, alaska, peninsula, around, bristol, bay, and, on, the, eastern, shores, of, the, bering, strait, c, 2, 500, bce, moved, into, north, america, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, a, paleo, eskimo, culture, branched, off, into, two, cultural, variants, including, the, pre, dorset, and, the, independence, traditions, of, greenland, the, descendants, of, the, pre, dorset, cultural, group, the, dorset, culture, was, displaced, by, the, final, migrants, from, the, bering, sea, coast, line, the, thule, people, the, ancestors, of, modern, inuit, by, 1000, common, era, ce, around, the, same, time, as, the, inuit, migrated, into, greenland, viking, settlers, began, arriving, in, greenland, in, 982, and, vinland, shortly, thereafter, establishing, a, settlement, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, near, the, northernmost, tip, of, newfoundland, contact, between, the, norse, colonies, and, europe, was, maintained, as, james, watson, curran, states, from, 985, to, 1410, greenland, was, in, touch, with, the, world, then, silence, in, 1492, the, vatican, noted, that, no, news, of, that, country, at, the, end, of, the, world, had, been, received, for, 80, years, and, the, bishopric, of, the, colony, was, offered, to, a, certain, ecclesiastic, if, he, would, go, and, restore, christianity, there, he, didn, t, go, although, there, had, been, previous, trans, oceanic, contact, large, scale, european, colonization, of, the, americas, began, with, the, first, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, the, first, spanish, settlement, in, the, americas, was, la, isabela, in, northern, hispaniola, this, town, was, abandoned, shortly, after, in, favor, of, santo, domingo, de, guzm, n, founded, in, 1496, the, oldest, american, city, of, european, foundation, this, was, the, base, from, which, the, spanish, monarchy, administered, its, new, colonies, and, their, expansion, santo, domingo, was, subject, to, frequent, raids, by, english, and, french, pirates, on, the, continent, panama, city, on, the, pacific, coast, of, central, america, founded, on, august, 15, 1519, played, an, important, role, being, the, base, for, the, spanish, conquest, of, south, america, conquistador, lucas, v, zquez, de, ayll, n, established, san, miguel, de, guadalupe, the, first, european, settlement, in, what, is, now, the, united, states, on, the, pee, dee, river, in, south, carolina, during, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, spanish, colonists, conducted, raids, throughout, the, caribbean, basin, bringing, captives, from, central, america, northern, south, america, and, florida, back, to, hispaniola, and, other, spanish, settlements, france, led, by, jacques, cartier, and, giovanni, da, verrazzano, focused, primarily, on, north, america, english, explorations, of, the, americas, were, led, by, giovanni, caboto, and, sir, walter, raleigh, the, dutch, in, new, netherland, confined, their, operations, to, manhattan, island, long, island, the, hudson, river, valley, and, what, later, became, new, jersey, the, spread, of, new, diseases, brought, by, europeans, and, african, slaves, killed, many, of, the, inhabitants, of, north, america, and, south, america, with, a, general, population, crash, of, native, americans, occurring, in, the, mid, 16th, century, often, well, ahead, of, european, contact, one, of, the, most, devastating, diseases, was, smallpox, european, immigrants, were, often, part, of, state, sponsored, attempts, to, found, colonies, in, the, americas, migration, continued, as, people, moved, to, the, americas, fleeing, religious, persecution, or, seeking, economic, opportunities, millions, of, individuals, were, forcibly, transported, to, the, americas, as, slaves, prisoners, or, indentured, servants, decolonization, of, the, americas, began, with, the, american, revolution, and, the, haitian, revolution, in, the, late, 1700s, this, was, followed, by, numerous, latin, american, wars, of, independence, in, the, early, 1800s, between, 1811, and, 1825, paraguay, argentina, chile, gran, colombia, the, united, provinces, of, central, america, mexico, brazil, peru, and, bolivia, gained, independence, from, spain, and, portugal, in, armed, revolutions, after, the, dominican, republic, won, independence, from, haiti, it, was, re, annexed, by, spain, in, 1861, but, reclaimed, its, independence, in, 1865, at, the, conclusion, of, the, dominican, restoration, war, the, last, violent, episode, of, decolonization, was, the, cuban, war, of, independence, which, became, the, spanish, american, war, which, resulted, in, the, independence, of, cuba, in, 1898, and, the, transfer, of, sovereignty, over, puerto, rico, from, spain, to, the, united, states, peaceful, decolonization, began, with, the, united, states, s, purchase, of, louisiana, from, france, in, 1803, florida, from, spain, in, 1819, of, alaska, from, russia, in, 1867, and, the, danish, west, indies, from, denmark, in, 1916, canada, became, independent, of, the, united, kingdom, starting, with, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, statute, of, westminster, 1931, and, ending, with, the, patriation, of, the, canadian, constitution, in, 1982, the, dominion, of, newfoundland, similarly, achieved, independence, under, the, balfour, declaration, and, statute, of, westminster, but, relinquished, self, rule, in, 1934, it, was, subsequently, confederated, with, canada, in, 1949, the, remaining, european, colonies, in, the, caribbean, began, to, achieve, peaceful, independence, well, after, world, war, ii, jamaica, and, trinidad, and, tobago, became, independent, in, 1962, and, guyana, and,

the, americas, make, up, most, of, the, land, in, earth, s, western, hemisphere, the, northernmost, point, of, the, americas, is, kaffeklubben, island, which, is, the, most, northerly, point, of, land, on, earth, the, southernmost, point, is, the, islands, of, southern, thule, although, they, are, sometimes, considered, part, of, antarctica, the, mainland, of, the, americas, is, the, world, s, longest, north, to, south, landmass, the, distance, between, its, two, polar, extremities, murchison, promontory, on, the, boothia, peninsula, in, northern, canada, and, cape, froward, in, chilean, patagonia, is, roughly, 14, 000, km, 8, 700, mi, the, mainland, s, most, westerly, point, is, the, end, of, the, seward, peninsula, in, alaska, attu, island, further, off, the, alaskan, coast, to,

greenland, is, the, most, easterly, point, of, the, continental, shelf, south, america, broke, off, from, the, west, of, the, supercontinent, gondwana, around, 135, million, years, ago, forming, its, own, continent, around, 15, million, years, ago, the, collision, of, the, caribbean, plate, and, the, pacific, plate, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, a, series, of, volcanoes, along, the, border, that, created, a, number, of, islands, the, gaps, in, the, archipelago, of, central, america, filled, in, with, material, eroded, off, north, america, and, south, america, plus, new, land, created, by, continued, volcanism, by, three, million, years, ago, the, continents, of, north, america, and, south, america, were, linked, by, the, isthmus, of, panama, thereby, forming, the, single, landmass, of, the, americas, the, great, american, interchange, resulted, in, many, species, being, spread, across, the, americas, such, as, the, cougar, porcupine, opossums, armadillos, and, hummingbirds, the, geography, of, the, western, americas, is, dominated, by, the, american, cordillera, with, the, andes, running, along, the, west, coast, of, south, america, and, the, rocky, mountains, and, other, north, american, cordillera, ranges, running, along, the, western, side, of, north, america, the, 2, 300, kilometer, long, 1, 400, mi, appalachian, mountains, run, along, the, east, coast, of, north, america, from, alabama, to, newfoundland, north, of, the, appalachians, the, arctic, cordillera, runs, along, the, eastern, coast, of, canada, the, largest, mountain, ranges, are, the, andes, and, rocky, mountains, the, sierra, nevada, and, the, cascade, range, reach, similar, altitudes, as, the, rocky, mountains, but, are, significantly, smaller, in, north, america, the, greatest, number, of, fourteeners, are, in, the, united, states, and, more, specifically, in, the, us, state, of, colorado, the, highest, peaks, of, the, americas, are, located, in, the, andes, with, aconcagua, of, argentina, being, the, highest, in, north, america, denali, mount, mckinley, in, the, us, state, of, alaska, is, the, tallest, between, its, coastal, mountain, ranges, north, america, has, vast, flat, areas, the, interior, plains, spread, over, much, of, the, continent, with, low, relief, the, canadian, shield, covers, almost, 5, million, km, 2, of, north, america, and, is, generally, quite, flat, similarly, the, north, east, of, south, america, is, covered, by, the, flat, amazon, basin, the, brazilian, highlands, on, the, east, coast, are, fairly, smooth, but, show, some, variations, in, landform, while, farther, south, the, gran, chaco, and, pampas, are, broad, lowlands, the, climate, of, the, americas, varies, significantly, from, region, to, region, tropical, rainforest, climate, occurs, in, the, latitudes, of, the, amazon, american, cloud, forests, southeastern, florida, and, dari, n, gap, in, the, rocky, mountains, and, andes, dry, and, continental, climates, are, observed, often, the, higher, altitudes, of, these, mountains, are, snow, capped, southeastern, north, america, is, well, known, for, its, occurrence, of, tornadoes, and, hurricanes, of, which, the, vast, majority, of, tornadoes, occur, in, the, united, states, tornado, alley, as, well, as, in, the, southerly, dixie, alley, in, the, north, american, late, winter, and, early, spring, seasons, often, parts, of, the, caribbean, are, exposed, to, the, violent, effects, of, hurricanes, these, weather, systems, are, formed, by, the, collision, of, dry, cool, air, from, canada, and, wet, warm, air, from, the, atlantic, with, coastal, mountains, and, interior, plains, the, americas, have, several, large, river, basins, that, drain, the, continents, the, largest, river, basin, in, north, america, is, that, of, the, mississippi, covering, the, second, largest, watershed, on, the, planet, the, mississippi, missouri, river, system, drains, most, of, 31, states, of, the, united, states, most, of, the, great, plains, and, large, areas, between, the, rocky, and, appalachian, mountains, this, river, is, the, fourth, longest, in, the, world, and, tenth, most, powerful, in, the, world, in, north, america, to, the, east, of, the, appalachian, mountains, there, are, no, major, rivers, but, rather, a, series, of, rivers, and, streams, that, flow, east, with, their, terminus, in, the, atlantic, ocean, such, as, the, hudson, river, saint, john, river, and, savannah, river, a, similar, instance, arises, with, central, canadian, rivers, that, drain, into, hudson, bay, the, largest, being, the, churchill, river, on, the, west, coast, of, north, america, the, main, rivers, are, the, colorado, river, columbia, river, yukon, river, fraser, river, and, sacramento, river, the, colorado, river, drains, much, of, the, southern, rockies, and, parts, of, the, basin, and, range, province, the, river, flows, approximately, 1, 450, miles, 2, 330, km, into, the, gulf, of, california, during, which, over, time, it, has, carved, out, natural, phenomena, such, as, the, grand, canyon, and, created, phenomena, such, as, the, salton, sea, the, columbia, is, a, large, river, 1, 243, miles, 2, 000, km, long, in, central, western, north, america, and, is, the, most, powerful, river, on, the, west, coast, of, the, americas, in, the, far, northwest, of, north, america, the, yukon, drains, much, of, the, alaskan, peninsula, and, flows, 1, 980, miles, 3, 190, km, from, parts, of, yukon, and, the, northwest, territory, to, the, pacific, draining, to, the, arctic, ocean, of, canada, the, mackenzie, river, drains, waters, from, the, arctic, great, lakes, of, arctic, canada, as, opposed, to, the, saint, lawrence, river, that, drains, the, great, lakes, of, southern, canada, into, the, atlantic, ocean, the, mackenzie, river, is, the, largest, in, canada, and, drains, 1, 805, 200, square, kilometers, 697, 000, sq, mi, the, largest, river, basin, in, south, america, is, that, of, the, amazon, which, has, the, highest, volume, flow, of, any, river, on, earth, the, second, largest, watershed, of, south, america, is, that, of, the, paran, river, which, covers, about, 2, 5, million, km, 2, north, america, and, south, america, began, to, develop, a, shared, population, of, flora, and, fauna, around, 2, 5, million, years, ago, when, continental, drift, brought, the, two, continents, into, contact, via, the, isthmus, of, panama, initially, the, exchange, of, biota, was, roughly, equal, with, north, american, genera, migrating, into, south, america, in, about, the, same, proportions, as, south, american, genera, migrated, into, north, america, this, exchange, is, known, as, the, great, american, interchange, the, exchange, became, lopsided, after, roughly, a, million, years, with, the, total, spread, of, south, american, genera, into, north, america, far, more, limited, in, scope, than, the, spread, of, north, american, genera, into, south, america, there, are, 35, sovereign, states, in, the, americas, as, well, as, an, autonomous, country, of, denmark, three, overseas, departments, of, france, three, overseas, collectivities, of, france, and, one, uninhabited, territory, of, france, eight, overseas, territories, of, the, united, kingdom, three, constituent, countries, of, the, netherlands, three, public, bodies, of, the, netherlands, two, unincorporated, territories, of, the, united, states, and, one, uninhabited, territory, of, the, united, states, in, 2021, the, total, population, of, the, americas, was, about, 1, 03, billion, people, divided, as, follows, there, are, three, urban, centers, that, each, hold, titles, for, being, the, largest, population, area, based, on, the, three, main, demographic, concepts, in, accordance, with, these, definitions, the, three, largest, population, centers, in, the, americas, are, mexico, city, anchor, to, the, largest, metropolitan, area, in, the, americas, new, york, city, anchor, to, the, largest, urban, area, in, the, americas, and, s, o, paulo, the, largest, city, proper, in, the, americas, all, three, cities, maintain, alpha, classification, and, large, scale, influence, the, population, of, the, americas, is, made, up, of, the, descendants, of, four, large, ethnic, groups, and, their, combinations, the, majority, of, the, population, lives, in, latin, america, named, for, its, predominant, cultures, rooted, in, latin, europe, including, the, two, dominant, languages, spanish, and, portuguese, both, romance, languages, more, specifically, in, the, iberian, nations, of, portugal, and, spain, hence, the, use, of, the, term, ibero, america, as, a, synonym, latin, america, is, typically, contrasted, with, anglo, america, where, english, a, germanic, language, is, prevalent, and, which, comprises, canada, with, the, exception, of, francophone, canada, rooted, in, latin, europe, see, quebec, and, acadia, and, the, united, states, both, countries, are, located, in, north, america, with, cultures, deriving, predominantly, from, british, and, other, germanic, roots, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, brought, millions, of, africans, to, the, territories, of, the, americas, under, the, colonial, rule, of, european, powers, in, south, america, portugal, played, a, significant, role, in, the, trafficking, of, enslaved, africans, with, estimates, suggesting, that, around, 40, of, all, africans, forcibly, brought, to, the, americas, were, taken, to, brazil, alone, to, work, primarily, in, sugar, cane, plantations, mining, and, agricultural, endeavors, in, north, america, the, british, empire, was, heavily, involved, in, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, with, the, establishment, of, colonies, such, as, virginia, where, enslaved, africans, were, primarily, used, as, labor, in, tobacco, plantations, and, later, in, other, agricultural, and, domestic, sectors, this, system, perpetuated, for, centuries, shaping, the, socio, economic, landscape, of, all,
