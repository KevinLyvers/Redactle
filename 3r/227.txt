the, mid, atlantic, ridge, is, a, mid, ocean, ridge, a, divergent, or, constructive, plate, boundary, located, along, the, floor, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, part, of, the, longest, mountain, range, in, the, world, in, the, north, atlantic, the, ridge, separates, the, north, american, from, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, african, plate, north, and, south, of, the, azores, triple, junction, in, the, south, atlantic, it, separates, the, african, and, south, american, plates, the, ridge, extends, from, a, junction, with, the, gakkel, ridge, mid, arctic, ridge, northeast, of, greenland, southward, to, the, bouvet, triple, junction, in, the, south, atlantic, although, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, is, mostly, an, underwater, feature, portions, of, it, have, enough, elevation, to, extend, above, sea, level, for, example, in, iceland, the, ridge, has, an, average, spreading, rate, of, about, 2, 5, centimetres, 1, in, per, year, a, ridge, under, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, was, first, inferred, by, matthew, fontaine, maury, in, 1853, based, on, soundings, by, the, uss, dolphin, the, existence, of, the, ridge, and, its, extension, into, the, south, atlantic, was, confirmed, during, the, expedition, of, hms, challenger, in, 1872, a, team, of, scientists, on, board, led, by, charles, wyville, thomson, discovered, a, large, rise, in, the, middle, of, the, atlantic, while, investigating, the, future, location, for, a, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, the, existence, of, such, a, ridge, was, confirmed, by, sonar, in, 1925, and, was, found, to, extend, around, cape, agulhas, into, the, indian, ocean, by, the, german, meteor, expedition, in, the, 1950s, mapping, of, the, earth, s, ocean, floors, by, marie, tharp, bruce, heezen, maurice, ewing, and, others, revealed, that, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, had, a, strange, bathymetry, of, valleys, and, ridges, with, its, central, valley, being, seismologically, active, and, the, epicenter, of, many, earthquakes, ewing, heezen, and, tharp, discovered, that, the, ridge, is, part, of, a, 40, 000, km, 25, 000, mile, long, essentially, continuous, system, of, mid, ocean, ridges, on, the, floors, of, all, the, earth, s, oceans, the, discovery, of, this, worldwide, ridge, system, led, to, the, theory, of, seafloor, spreading, and, general, acceptance, of, alfred, wegener, s, theory, of, continental, drift, and, expansion, in, the, modified, form, of, plate, tectonics, the, ridge, is, central, to, the, breakup, of, the, hypothetical, supercontinent, of, pangaea, that, began, some, 180, million, years, ago, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, includes, a, deep, rift, valley, that, runs, along, the, axis, of, the, ridge, for, nearly, its, entire, length, this, rift, marks, the, actual, boundary, between, adjacent, tectonic, plates, where, magma, from, the, mantle, reaches, the, seafloor, erupting, as, lava, and, producing, new, crustal, material, for, the, plates, near, the, equator, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, is, divided, into, the, north, atlantic, ridge, and, the, south, atlantic, ridge, by, the, romanche, trench, a, narrow, submarine, trench, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 7, 758, m, 25, 453, ft, one, of, the, deepest, locations, of, the, atlantic, ocean, this, trench, however, is, not, regarded, as, the, boundary, between, the, north, and, south, american, plates, nor, the, eurasian, and, african, plates, the, islands, on, or, near, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, from, north, to, south, with, their, respective, highest, peaks, and, location, are, northern, hemisphere, north, atlantic, ridge, southern, hemisphere, south, atlantic, ridge, the, submarine, section, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, close, to, southwest, iceland, is, known, as, the, reykjanes, ridge, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, runs, through, iceland, where, the, ridge, is, also, known, as, the, neovolcanic, zone, in, northern, iceland, the, tj, rnes, fracture, zone, connects, iceland, to, the, kolbeinsey, ridge, the, ridge, sits, atop, a, geologic, feature, known, as, the, mid, atlantic, rise, which, is, a, progressive, bulge, that, runs, the, length, of, the, atlantic, ocean, with, the, ridge, resting, on, the, highest, point, of, this, linear, bulge, this, bulge, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, upward, convective, forces, in, the, asthenosphere, pushing, the, oceanic, crust, and, lithosphere, this, divergent, boundary, first, formed, in, the, triassic, period, when, a, series, of, three, armed, grabens, coalesced, on, the, supercontinent, pangaea, to, form, the, ridge, usually, only, two, arms, of, any, given, three, armed, graben, become, part, of, a, divergent, plate, boundary, the, failed, arms, are, called, aulacogens, and, the, aulacogens, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, eventually, became, many, of, the, large, river, valleys, seen, along, the, americas, and, africa, including, the, mississippi, river, amazon, river, and, niger, river, the, fundy, basin, on, the, atlantic, coast, of, north, america, between, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, in, canada, is, evidence, of, the, ancestral, mid, atlantic, ridge
