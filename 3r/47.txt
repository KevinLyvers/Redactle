the, adriatic, sea, e, d, r, i, t, k, is, a, body, of, water, separating, the, italian, peninsula, from, the, balkan, peninsula, the, adriatic, is, the, northernmost, arm, of, the, mediterranean, sea, extending, from, the, strait, of, otranto, where, it, connects, to, the, ionian, sea, to, the, northwest, and, the, po, valley, the, countries, with, coasts, on, the, adriatic, are, albania, bosnia, and, herzegovina, croatia, italy, montenegro, and, slovenia, the, adriatic, contains, more, than, 1, 300, islands, mostly, located, along, the, croatian, part, of, its, eastern, coast, it, is, divided, into, three, basins, the, northern, being, the, shallowest, and, the, southern, being, the, deepest, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 1, 233, metres, 4, 045, ft, the, otranto, sill, an, underwater, ridge, is, located, at, the, border, between, the, adriatic, and, ionian, seas, the, prevailing, currents, flow, counterclockwise, from, the, strait, of, otranto, along, the, eastern, coast, and, back, to, the, strait, along, the, western, italian, coast, tidal, movements, in, the, adriatic, are, slight, although, larger, amplitudes, are, known, to, occur, occasionally, the, adriatic, s, salinity, is, lower, than, the, mediterranean, s, because, the, adriatic, collects, a, third, of, the, fresh, water, flowing, into, the, mediterranean, acting, as, a, dilution, basin, the, surface, water, temperatures, generally, range, from, 30, c, 86, f, in, summer, to, 12, c, 54, f, in, winter, significantly, moderating, the, adriatic, basin, s, climate, the, adriatic, sea, sits, on, the, apulian, or, adriatic, microplate, which, separated, from, the, african, plate, in, the, mesozoic, era, the, plate, s, movement, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, surrounding, mountain, chains, and, apennine, tectonic, uplift, after, its, collision, with, the, eurasian, plate, in, the, late, oligocene, the, italian, peninsula, first, formed, separating, the, adriatic, basin, from, the, rest, of, the, mediterranean, all, types, of, sediment, are, found, in, the, adriatic, with, the, bulk, of, the, material, transported, by, the, po, and, other, rivers, on, the, western, coast, the, western, coast, is, alluvial, or, terraced, while, the, eastern, coast, is, highly, indented, with, pronounced, karstification, there, are, dozens, of, marine, protected, areas, in, the, adriatic, designed, to, protect, the, sea, s, karst, habitats, and, biodiversity, the, sea, is, abundant, in, flora, and, fauna, more, than, 7, 000, species, are, identified, as, native, to, the, adriatic, many, of, them, endemic, rare, and, threatened, ones, the, adriatic, s, shores, are, populated, by, more, than, 3, 5, million, people, the, largest, cities, are, bari, venice, trieste, and, split, the, earliest, settlements, on, the, adriatic, shores, were, etruscan, illyrian, and, greek, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, region, was, under, rome, s, control, in, the, middle, ages, the, adriatic, shores, and, the, sea, itself, were, controlled, to, a, varying, extent, by, a, series, of, states, most, notably, the, byzantine, empire, the, croatian, kingdom, the, republic, of, venice, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, the, ottoman, empire, the, napoleonic, wars, resulted, in, the, first, french, empire, gaining, coastal, control, and, the, british, effort, to, counter, the, french, in, the, area, ultimately, securing, most, of, the, eastern, adriatic, shore, and, the, po, valley, for, austria, following, italian, unification, the, kingdom, of, italy, started, an, eastward, expansion, that, lasted, until, the, 20th, century, following, world, war, i, and, the, collapse, of, austria, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, the, entire, eastern, coast, s, control, passed, to, yugoslavia, and, albania, except, for, trieste, and, surrounding, area, which, remained, under, italian, control, the, former, disintegrated, during, the, 1990s, resulting, in, four, new, states, on, the, adriatic, coast, italy, and, yugoslavia, agreed, on, their, maritime, boundaries, by, 1975, and, this, boundary, is, recognised, by, yugoslavia, s, successor, states, but, the, maritime, boundaries, between, slovenia, croatia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, and, montenegro, are, still, disputed, italy, and, albania, agreed, on, their, maritime, boundary, in, 1992, fisheries, and, tourism, are, significant, sources, of, income, all, along, the, adriatic, coast, adriatic, croatia, s, tourism, industry, has, grown, faster, economically, than, the, rest, of, the, adriatic, basin, s, maritime, transport, is, also, a, significant, branch, of, the, area, s, economy, there, are, 19, seaports, in, the, adriatic, that, each, handle, more, than, a, million, tonnes, of, cargo, per, year, the, largest, adriatic, seaport, by, annual, cargo, turnover, is, the, port, of, trieste, while, the, port, of, split, is, the, largest, adriatic, seaport, by, passengers, served, per, year, the, origins, of, the, name, adriatic, are, linked, to, the, illyrian, settlement, of, adria, which, probably, derives, its, name, from, illyrian, adur, water, sea, in, classical, antiquity, the, sea, was, known, as, mare, adriaticum, mare, hadriaticum, also, sometimes, simplified, to, adria, or, less, frequently, as, mare, superum, upper, sea, the, two, terms, were, not, synonymous, however, mare, adriaticum, generally, corresponds, to, the, adriatic, sea, s, extent, spanning, from, the, gulf, of, venice, to, the, strait, of, otranto, that, boundary, became, more, consistently, defined, by, roman, authors, early, greek, sources, place, the, boundary, between, the, adriatic, and, ionian, seas, at, various, places, ranging, from, adjacent, to, the, gulf, of, venice, to, the, southern, tip, of, the, peloponnese, eastern, shores, of, sicily, and, western, shores, of, crete, mare, superum, on, the, other, hand, normally, encompassed, both, the, modern, adriatic, sea, and, the, sea, off, the, apennine, peninsula, s, southern, coast, as, far, as, the, strait, of, sicily, another, name, used, in, the, period, was, mare, dalmaticum, applied, to, waters, off, the, coast, of, dalmatia, or, illyricum, during, the, early, modern, period, the, entire, sea, was, also, known, as, the, gulf, of, venice, italian, golfo, di, venezia, although, that, name, is, now, informally, applied, only, to, the, northern, area, of, the, sea, from, maestra, point, in, the, po, delta, to, cape, kamenjak, on, the, istrian, peninsula, the, names, for, the, sea, in, the, languages, of, the, surrounding,

serbo, croatian, jadransko, more, slovene, jadransko, morje, venetian, mar, adri, tico, in, serbo, croatian, and, slovene, the, sea, is, often, referred, to, as, simply, jadran, the, adriatic, sea, is, a, semi, enclosed, sea, bordered, in, the, southwest, by, the, apennine, or, italian, peninsula, in, the, northwest, by, the, italian, regions, of, veneto, and, friuli, venezia, giulia, and, in, the, northeast, by, slovenia, croatia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, montenegro, and, albania, the, balkan, peninsula, in, the, southeast, the, adriatic, sea, connects, to, the, ionian, sea, at, the, 72, kilometre, 45, mi, wide, strait, of, otranto, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, defines, the, boundary, between, the, adriatic, and, the, ionian, seas, as, a, line, running, from, the, butrinto, river, s, mouth, latitude, 39, 44, n, in, albania, to, the, karagol, cape, in, corfu, through, this, island, to, the, kephali, cape, these, two, capes, are, in, latitude, 39, 45, n, and, on, to, the, santa, maria, di, leuca, cape, latitude, 39, 48, n, it, extends, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, from, the, northwest, to, the, southeast, and, is, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, wide, it,

representing, the, mediterranean, s, northernmost, portion, the, sea, is, geographically, divided, into, the, northern, adriatic, central, or, middle, adriatic, and, southern, adriatic, the, adriatic, sea, drainage, basin, encompasses, 235, 000, square, kilometres, 91, 000, sq, mi, yielding, a, land, sea, ratio, of, 1, 8, the, drainage, basin, s, mean, elevation, is, 782, metres, 2, 566, ft, above, sea, level, with, a, mean, slope, of, 12, 1, major, rivers, discharging, into, the, adriatic, include, the, po, so, a, krka, neretva, drin, buna, and, vjos, in, the, late, 19th, century, austria, hungary, established, a, geodetic, network, with, an, elevation, benchmark, using, the, average, adriatic, sea, level, at, the, sartorio, pier, in, trieste, italy, the, benchmark, was, subsequently, retained, by, austria, adopted, by, yugoslavia, and, retained, by, the, states, that, emerged, after, its, dissolution, in, 2016, slovenia, adopted, a, new, elevation, benchmark, referring, to, the, upgraded, tide, gauge, station, in, the, coastal, town, of, koper, the, alps, which, also, have, a, large, meteorological, impact, on, the, mediterranean, touch, the, adriatic, in, the, area, around, trieste, towards, duino, and, barcola, the, adriatic, sea, contains, more, than, 1, 300, islands, and, islets, most, along, the, adriatic, s, eastern, coast, especially, in, croatia, with, 1, 246, counted, the, number, includes, islands, islets, and, rocks, of, all, sizes, including, ones, emerging, at, ebb, tide, only, the, croatian, islands, include, the, largest, cres, and, krk, each, covering, about, the, same, area, of, 405, 78, square, kilometres, 156, 67, sq, mi, and, the, tallest, bra, whose, peak, reaches, 780, metres, 2, 560, ft, above, sea, level, the, islands, of, cres, and, the, adjacent, lo, inj, are, separated, only, by, a, narrow, navigable, canal, dug, in, the, time, of, classical, antiquity, the, original, single, island, was, known, to, the, greeks, as, apsyrtides, the, croatian, islands, include, 47, permanently, inhabited, ones, the, most, populous, among, them, being, krk, kor, ula, and, bra, the, islands, along, the, adriatic, s, western, italian, coast, are, smaller, and, less, numerous, than, those, along, the, opposite, coast, the, best, known, ones, are, the, 117, islands, on, which, the, city, of, venice, is, built, the, northern, shore, of, the, greek, island, of, corfu, also, lies, in, the, adriatic, sea, as, defined, by, the, iho, the, iho, boundary, places, the, diapontia, islands, northwest, of, corfu, in, the, adriatic, sea, exclusive, economic, zones, in, adriatic, sea, the, adriatic, sea, s, average, depth, is, 259, 5, metres, 851, ft, and, its, maximum, depth, is, 1, 233, metres, 4, 045, ft, however, the, north, adriatic, basin, rarely, exceeds, a, depth, of, 100, metres, 330, ft, the, north, adriatic, basin, extending, between, venice, and, trieste, towards, a, line, connecting, ancona, and, zadar, is, only, 15, metres, 49, ft, deep, at, its, northwestern, end, it, gradually, deepens, towards, the, southeast, it, is, the, largest, mediterranean, shelf, and, is, simultaneously, a, dilution, basin, and, a, site, of, bottom, water, formation, the, middle, adriatic, basin, is, south, of, the, ancona, zadar, line, with, the, 270, metre, 890, ft, deep, middle, adriatic, pit, also, called, the, pomo, depression, or, the, jabuka, pit, the, 170, metre, 560, ft, deep, palagru, a, sill, is, south, of, the, middle, adriatic, pit, separating, it, from, the, 1, 200, metre, 3, 900, ft, deep, south, adriatic, pit, and, the, middle, adriatic, basin, from, the, south, adriatic, basin, further, on, to, the, south, the, sea, floor, rises, to, 780, metres, 2, 560, ft, to, form, the, otranto, sill, at, the, boundary, to, the, ionian, sea, the, south, adriatic, basin, is, similar, in, many, respects, to, the, northern, ionian, sea, to, which, it, is, connected, transversely, the, adriatic, sea, is, also, asymmetric, the, apennine, peninsular, coast, is, relatively, smooth, with, very, few, islands, and, the, mount, conero, and, gargano, promontories, as, the, only, significant, protrusions, into, the, sea, in, contrast, the, balkan, peninsular, coast, is, rugged, with, numerous, islands, especially, in, croatia, the, coast, s, ruggedness, is, exacerbated, by, the, dinaric, alps, proximity, to, the, coast, in, contrast, to, the, opposite, italian, coast, where, the, apennine, mountains, are, further, away, from, the, shoreline, the, coastal, water, dynamics, are, determined, by, the, asymmetric, coasts, and, the, inflow, of, the, mediterranean, seawater, through, the, straits, of, otranto, and, further, on, along, the, eastern, coast, the, smooth, italian, coast, with, very, few, protrusions, and, no, major, islands, allows, the, western, adriatic, current, to, flow, smoothly, which, is, composed, of, the, relatively, freshwater, mass, on, the, surface, and, the, cold, and, dense, water, mass, at, the, bottom, the, coastal, currents, on, the, opposite, shore, are, far, more, complex, owing, to, the, jagged, shoreline, several, large, islands, and, the, proximity, of, the, dinaric, alps, to, the, shore, the, last, produces, significant, temperature, variations, between, the, sea, and, the, hinterland, which, leads, to, the, creation, of, local, jets, the, tidal, movement, is, normally, slight, usually, remaining, below, 30, centimetres, 12, in, the, amphidromic, point, is, at, the, mid, width, east, of, ancona, the, normal, tide, levels, are, known, to, increase, significantly, in, a, conducive, environment, leading, to, coastal, flooding, this, phenomenon, is, most, famously, known, in, italy, especially, venice, as, acqua, alta, such, tides, can, exceed, normal, levels, by, more, than, 140, centimetres, 55, in, with, the, highest, tide, level, of, 194, centimetres, 76, in, observed, on, 4, november, 1966, such, flooding, is, caused, by, a, combination, of, factors, including, the, alignment, of, the, sun, and, moon, meteorological, factors, such, as, sirocco, related, storm, surges, and, the, basin, s, geometric, shape, which, amplifies, or, reduces, the, astronomical, component, moreover, the, adriatic, s, long, and, narrow, rectangular, shape, is, the, source, of, an, oscillating, water, motion, french, seiche, along, the, basin, s, minor, axis, finally, venice, is, increasingly, vulnerable, to, flooding, due, to, coastal, area, soil, subsidence, such, unusually, high, tides, resulting, in, flooding, have, also, been, observed, elsewhere, in, the, adriatic, sea, and, have, been, recorded, in, recent, years, in, the, towns, of, koper, zadar, and, ibenik, as, well, it, is, estimated, that, the, adriatic, s, entire, volume, is, exchanged, through, the, strait, of, otranto, in, 3, 4, 0, 4, years, a, comparatively, short, period, for, instance, approximately, 500, years, are, necessary, to, exchange, all, the, black, sea, s, water, this, short, period, is, particularly, important, as, the, rivers, flowing, into, the, adriatic, discharge, up, to, 5, 700, cubic, metres, per, second, 200, 000, cu, ft, s, this, rate, of, discharge, amounts, to, 0, 5, of, the, total, adriatic, sea, volume, or, a, 1, 3, metre, 4, ft, 3, in, layer, of, water, each, year, the, greatest, portion, of, the, discharge, from, any, single, river, comes, from, the, po, 28, with, an, average, discharge, from, it, alone, of, 1, 569, cubic, metres, per, second, 55, 400, cu, ft, s, in, terms, of, the, annual, total, discharge, into, the, entire, mediterranean, sea, the, po, is, ranked, second, followed, by, the, neretva, and, drin, which, rank, as, third, and, fourth, another, significant, contributor, of, freshwater, to, the, adriatic, is, the, submarine, groundwater, discharge, through, submarine, springs, croatian, vrulja, it, is, estimated, to, comprise, 29, of, the, total, water, flux, into, the, adriatic, the, submarine, springs, include, thermal, springs, discovered, offshore, near, the, town, of, izola, the, thermal, spring, water, is, rich, with, hydrogen, sulfide, has, a, temperature, of, 22, to, 29, 6, c, 71, 6, to, 85, 3, f, and, has, enabled, the, development, of, specific, ecosystems, the, inflow, of, freshwater, representing, a, third, of, the, freshwater, volume, flowing, into, the, mediterranean, makes, the, adriatic, a, dilution, basin, for, the, mediterranean, sea, the, middle, and, south, adriatic, gyres, sag, are, significant, cyclonic, circulation, features, with, the, former, being, intermittent, and, the, latter, permanent, the, sag, measures, 150, kilometres, 93, miles, in, diameter, it, contributes, to, the, flow, of, bottom, water, from, the, adriatic, to, the, levantine, basin, through, the, ionian, sea, through, that, process, the, adriatic, sea, produces, most, of, the, east, mediterranean, deep, water, the, adriatic, s, surface, temperature, usually, ranges, from, 22, to, 30, c, 72, to, 86, f, in, the, summer, or, 12, to, 14, c, 54, to, 57, f, in, the, winter, except, along, the, western, adriatic, coast, s, northern, part, where, it, drops, to, 9, c, 48, f, in, the, winter, the, distinct, seasonal, temperature, variations, with, a, longitudinal, gradient, in, the, northern, and, transversal, gradient, in, the, middle, and, southern, adriatic, are, attributed, to, the, continental, characteristics, of, the, adriatic, sea, it, is, shallower, and, closer, to, land, than, are, oceans, during, particularly, cold, winters, sea, ice, may, appear, in, the, adriatic, s, shallow, coastal, areas, especially, in, the, venetian, lagoon, but, also, in, isolated, shallows, as, far, south, as, tisno, south, of, zadar, the, southern, adriatic, is, about, 8, to, 10, c, 14, to, 18, f, warmer, during, the, winter, than, the, more, northerly, regions, the, adriatic, s, salinity, variation, over, the, year, is, likewise, distinct, it, ranges, between, 38, and, 39, psus, the, southern, adriatic, is, subjected, to, saltier, water, from, the, levantine, basin, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, the, upper, half, of, the, adriatic, is, classified, as, humid, subtropical, climate, cfa, with, wetter, summers, and, colder, and, drier, winters, and, the, southern, adriatic, are, classified, as, hot, summer, mediterranean, climate, csa, the, air, temperature, can, fluctuate, by, about, 20, c, 36, f, during, a, season, the, predominant, winter, winds, are, the, bora, and, sirocco, called, jugo, along, the, eastern, coast, the, bora, is, significantly, conditioned, by, wind, gaps, in, the, dinaric, alps, bringing, cold, and, dry, continental, air, it, reaches, peak, speeds, in, the, areas, of, trieste, senj, and, split, with, gusts, of, up, to, 180, kilometres, per, hour, 97, kn, 110, mph, the, sirocco, brings, humid, and, warm, air, often, carrying, saharan, sand, causing, rain, dust, bari, venice, trieste, durr, s, on, the, adriatic, sea, s, coasts, and, islands, there, are, numerous, small, settlements, and, a, number, of, larger, cities, among, the, largest, are, counterclockwise, trieste, venice, rimini, ancona, pescara, and, bari, in, italy, vlor, and, durr, s, in, albania, split, zadar, and, rijeka, in, croatia, koper, in, slovenia, in, total, more, than, 3, 5, million, people, live, on, the, adriatic, coasts, there, are, also, some, larger, cities, that, are, located, very, near, the, coast, such, as, the, italian, cities, of, ravenna, and, lecce, venice, which, was, originally, built, on, islands, off, the, coast, is, most, at, risk, due, to, subsidence, but, the, threat, is, present, in, the, po, delta, as, well, the, causes, are, a, decrease, in, sedimentation, rate, due, to, loss, of, sediment, behind, dams, the, deliberate, excavation, of, sand, for, industrial, purposes, agricultural, use, of, water, and, removal, of, ground, water, the, sinking, of, venice, slowed, after, artesian, wells, were, banned, in, the, 1960s, but, the, city, remains, threatened, by, the, acqua, alta, floods, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, the, city, is, no, longer, sinking, but, a, state, of, alert, remains, in, place, in, may, 2003, then, prime, minister, silvio, berlusconi, inaugurated, the, mose, project, italian, modulo, sperimentale, elettromeccanico, an, experimental, model, for, evaluating, the, performance, of, inflatable, gates, the, project, proposes, laying, a, series, of, 79, inflatable, pontoons, across, the, sea, bed, at, the, three, entrances, to, the, venetian, lagoon, when, tides, are, predicted, to, rise, above, 110, centimetres, 43, in, the, pontoons, will, be, filled, with, air, and, block, the, incoming, water, from, the, adriatic, sea, this, engineering, work, was, due, to, be, completed, by, 2014, but, as, of, november, 2020, is, expected, to, be, completed, in, 2021, implemented, for, the, first, time, on, october, 3, 2020, the, barriers, are, made, to, seal, off, three, inlets, that, lead, to, the, venetian, lagoon, and, counteract, floods, of, up, to, ten, feet, in, addition, to, protecting, the, city, from, flooding, the, barrier, system, is, also, intended, to, stabilize, venice, s, water, levels, so, as, to, minimize, erosion, of, the, brick, walls, and, subsequently, the, foundations, of, various, buildings, in, the, city, however, concern, has, been, raised, regarding, the, frequency, of, its, use, while, only, necessary, a, few, days, a, year, the, worst, case, sea, level, rise, scenario, between, 2050, and, 2100, would, prompt, deployment, up, to, 187, days, a, year, essentially, cutting, off, the, venetian, lagoon, from, the, adriatic, sea, among, other, possible, adverse, effects, this, can, be, expected, to, lower, the, lagoon, s, oxygen, levels, and, trap, pollution, inside, of, the, city, geophysical, and, geological, information, indicate, that, the, adriatic, sea, and, the, po, valley, are, associated, with, a, tectonic, microplate, identified, as, the, apulian, or, adriatic, plate, that, separated, from, the, african, plate, during, the, mesozoic, era, this, separation, began, in, the, middle, and, late, triassic, when, limestone, began, to, be, deposited, in, the, area, between, the, norian, and, late, cretaceous, the, adriatic, and, apulia, carbonate, platforms, formed, as, a, thick, series, of, carbonate, sediments, dolomites, and, limestones, up, to, 8, 000, metres, 26, 000, ft, deep, remnants, of, the, former, are, found, in, the, adriatic, sea, as, well, as, in, the, southern, alps, and, the, dinaric, alps, and, remnants, of, the, latter, are, seen, as, the, gargano, promontory, and, the, maiella, mountain, in, the, eocene, and, early, oligocene, the, plate, moved, north, and, north, east, contributing, to, the, alpine, orogeny, along, with, the, african, and, eurasian, plates, movements, via, the, tectonic, uplift, of, the, dinarides, and, alps, in, the, late, oligocene, the, motion, was, reversed, and, the, apennine, mountains, orogeny, took, place, an, unbroken, zone, of, increased, seismic, activity, borders, the, adriatic, sea, with, a, belt, of, thrust, faults, generally, oriented, in, the, northeast, southwest, direction, on, the, east, coast, and, the, northeast, southwest, normal, faults, in, the, apennines, indicating, an, adriatic, counterclockwise, rotation, an, active, 200, kilometre, 120, mi, fault, has, been, identified, to, the, northwest, of, dubrovnik, adding, to, the, dalmatian, islands, as, the, eurasian, plate, slides, over, the, adriatic, microplate, furthermore, the, fault, causes, the, apennine, peninsula, s, southern, tip, to, move, towards, the, opposite, shore, by,

northern, adriatic, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, trieste, and, western, istria, is, gradually, subsiding, having, sunk, about, 1, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, in, the, past, two, thousand, years, in, the, middle, adriatic, basin, there, is, evidence, of, permian, volcanism, in, the, area, of, komi, a, on, the, island, of, vis, and, the, volcanic, islands, of, jabuka, and, brusnik, earthquakes, have, been, observed, in, the, region, since, the, earliest, historical, records, a, recent, strong, earthquake, in, the, region, was, the, 1979, montenegro, earthquake, measuring, 7, 0, on, the, richter, scale, historical, earthquakes, in, the, area, include, the, 1627, gargano, peninsula, and, the, 1667, dubrovnik, earthquakes, both, followed, by, strong, tsunamis, in, the, last, 600, years, fifteen, tsunamis, have, occurred, in, the, adriatic, sea, all, types, of, seafloor, sediments, are, found, in, the, adriatic, sea, the, northern, adriatic, s, comparatively, shallow, seabed, is, characterised, by, relict, sand, from, times, when, the, water, level, was, lower, and, the, area, was, a, sandy, beach, while, a, muddy, bed, is, typical, at, depths, below, 100, metres, 330, ft, there, are, five, geomorphological, units, in, the, adriatic, the, northern, adriatic, up, to, 100, metres, 330, ft, deep, the, north, adriatic, islands, area, protected, against, sediments, filling, it, in, by, outer, islands, pre, holocene, karst, relief, the, middle, adriatic, islands, area, large, dalmatian, islands, the, middle, adriatic, characterized, by, the, middle, adriatic, depression, and, the, southern, adriatic, consisting, of, a, coastal, shelf, and, the, southern, adriatic, depression, sediments, deposited, in, the, adriatic, sea, today, generally, come, from, the, northwest, coast, being, carried, by, the, po, reno, adige, brenta, tagliamento, piave, and, so, a, rivers, the, volume, of, sediments, carried, from, the, eastern, shore, by, the, rje, ina, zrmanja, krka, cetina, ombla, dragonja, mirna, ra, a, and, neretva, rivers, is, negligible, because, these, sediments, are, mostly, deposited, at, the, river, mouths, the, adriatic, s, western, shores, are, largely, either, alluvial, or, terraced, whereas, the, eastern, shores, are, predominantly, rocky, except, for, the, southernmost, part, of, the, shore, located, in, albania, that, consists, of, sandy, coves, and, rocky, capes, the, eastern, adriatic, shore, s, croatian, part, is, the, most, indented, mediterranean, coastline, most, of, the, eastern, coast, is, characterised, by, a, karst, topography, developed, from, the, adriatic, carbonate, platform, s, exposure, to, weathering, karstification, there, largely, began, after, the, dinarides, final, uplift, in, the, oligocene, and, the, miocene, when, carbonate, deposits, were, exposed, to, atmospheric, effects, this, extended, to, the, level, of, 120, metres, 390, ft, below, the, present, sea, level, exposed, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, it, is, estimated, that, some, karst, formations, are, from, earlier, sea, level, drops, most, notably, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, similarly, karst, developed, in, apulia, from, the, apulian, carbonate, platform, the, largest, part, of, the, eastern, coast, consists, of, carbonate, rocks, while, flysch, a, particular, type, of, sedimentary, rock, is, significantly, represented, in, the, gulf, of, trieste, coast, especially, along, slovenia, s, coast, where, the, 80, metre, 260, ft, strunjan, cliff, the, highest, cliff, on, the, entire, adriatic, and, the, only, one, of, its, type, on, the, eastern, adriatic, coast, is, located, on, the, kvarner, gulf, coast, opposite, krk, and, in, dalmatia, north, of, split, rocks, of, the, same, type, are, found, in, albania, and, on, the, western, adriatic, coast, there, are, alternations, of, maritime, and, alluvial, sediments, occurring, in, the, po, valley, at, the, adriatic, s, north, west, coast, and, as, far, west, as, piacenza, dating, to, the, pleistocene, as, the, sea, advanced, and, receded, over, the, valley, an, advance, began, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, which, brought, the, adriatic, to, a, high, point, at, about, 5, 500, years, ago, since, then, the, po, delta, has, been, prograding, expanding, extending, the, rate, of, coastal, zone, progradation, between, 1000, bc, and, 1200, ad, was, 4, metres, 13, ft, per, year, in, the, 12th, century, the, delta, advanced, at, a, rate, of, 25, metres, 82, ft, per, year, in, the, 17th, century, the, delta, began, to, become, a, human, controlled, environment, as, the, excavation, of, artificial, channels, started, the, channels, and, new, distributaries, of, the, po, have, been, prograding, at, rates, of, 50, metres, 160, ft, per, year, or, more, since, then, there, are, more, than, 20, other, rivers, flowing, into, the, adriatic, sea, in, italy, alone, also, forming, alluvial, coastlines, including, the, lagoons, of, venice, grado, and, caorle, there, are, smaller, eastern, adriatic, alluvial, coasts, in, the, deltas, of, the, dragonja, buna, and, neretva, rivers, the, adriatic, sea, is, a, unique, water, body, in, respect, of, its, overall, biogeochemical, physiognomy, it, exports, inorganic, nutrients, and, imports, particulate, organic, carbon, and, nitrogen, through, the, strait, of, otranto, acting, as, a, mineralization, site, the, exchange, of, the, substances, is, made, more, complex, by, bathymetry, of, the, adriatic, sea, 75, of, water, flowing, north, through, the, strait, recirculates, at, the, palagru, a, sill, and, north, adriatic, adds, no, more, than, 3, 4, of, water, to, the, south, adriatic, this, is, reflected, in, its, biogeography, and, ecology, and, particularly, in, the, composition, and, properties, of, its, ecosystems, its, main, biogeographic, units, are, the, northern, adriatic, the, central, adriatic, and, the, southern, adriatic, the, unique, nature, of, the, adriatic, gives, rise, to, an, abundance, of, endemic, flora, and, fauna, the, croatian, national, biodiversity, strategy, action, plan, identified, more, than, 7, 000, animal, and, plant, species, in, the, adriatic, sea, the, central, adriatic, is, especially, abundant, in, endemic, plant, species, with, 535, identified, species, of, green, brown, and, red, algae, four, out, of, five, mediterranean, seagrass, species, are, found, in, the, adriatic, sea, the, most, common, species, are, cymodocea, nodosa, and, zostera, noltii, while, zostera, marina, and, posidonia, oceanica, are, comparatively, rare, a, number, of, rare, and, threatened, species, are, also, found, along, the, adriatic, s, eastern, coast, it, is, relatively, clearer, and, less, polluted, than, the, western, adriatic, coast, in, part, because, the, sea, currents, flow, through, the, adriatic, in, a, counterclockwise, direction, thus, bringing, clearer, waters, up, the, eastern, coast, and, returning, increasingly, polluted, water, down, the, western, coast, this, circulation, has, significantly, contributed, to, the, biodiversity, of, the, countries, along, the, eastern, adriatic, coast, the, common, bottlenose, dolphin, is, frequent, in, the, eastern, coast, s, waters, only, and, the, croatian, coast, provides, refuge, for, the, critically, endangered, monk, seal, and, sea, turtles, recent, studies, revealed, that, cetaceans, and, other, marine, megafaunas, that, were, once, thought, to, be, vagrants, to, adriatic, sea, migrate, and, live, in, the, semi, closed, sea, on, larger, scales, largest, of, these, live, normally, is, the, fin, whale, and, sperm, whale, the, largest, of, toothed, whales, also, migrate, but, less, common, than, fin, whales, followed, by, cuvier, s, beaked, whales, basking, sharks, and, manta, rays, are, some, of, migrant, species, to, the, sea, historical, presences, of, depleted, or, extinct, species, such, as, north, atlantic, right, whales, extinct, or, functionally, extinct, atlantic, gray, whales, extinct, and, humpback, whales, have, been, speculated, as, well, tuna, has, been, caught, by, the, locals, in, the, upper, adriatic, for, thousands, of, years, the, very, large, schools, consisted, mainly, of, little, tunny, and, moved, as, far, as, the, gulf, of, trieste, however, increasing, fishing, prevented, the, migration, of, large, schools, of, fish, to, the, north, the, last, major, tuna, catch, was, made, there, in, 1954, by, the, fishermen, from, santa, croce, contovello, and, barcola, the, northern, adriatic, in, particular, is, rich, in, endemic, fish, fauna, around, thirty, species, of, fish, are, found, in, only, one, or, two, countries, bordering, the, adriatic, sea, these, are, particularly, due, to, or, dependent, upon, the, karst, morphology, of, the, coastal, or, submarine, topography, this, includes, inhabiting, subterranean, habitats, karst, rivers, and, areas, around, freshwater, springs, there, are, 45, known, subspecies, endemic, to, the, adriatic, s, coasts, and, islands, in, the, adriatic, there, are, at, least, 410, species, and, subspecies, of, fish, representing, approximately, 70, of, mediterranean, taxa, with, at, least, 7, species, endemic, to, the, adriatic, sixty, four, known, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, largely, because, of, overfishing, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, fish, found, in, the, adriatic, are, attributed, to, recent, processes, such, as, lessepsian, migration, and, escape, from, mariculture, the, biodiversity, of, the, adriatic, is, relatively, high, and, several, marine, protected, areas, have, been, established, by, countries, along, its, coasts, in, italy, these, are, miramare, in, the, gulf, of, trieste, in, the, northern, adriatic, torre, del, cerrano,

venice, is, often, cited, as, an, example, of, polluted, coastal, waters, where, shipping, transportation, farming, manufacturing, and, wastewater, disposal, contribute, to, polluting, the, sea, a, further, risk, is, presented, by, ballast, water, discharge, by, ships, especially, tankers, still, since, most, of, the, cargo, handled, by, the, adriatic, ports, and, virtually, all, liquid, tanker, cargo, handled, by, the, ports, is, coming, to, not, coming, from, the, adriatic, basin, the, risk, from, ballast, water, from, tankers, expelling, ballast, water, then, loading, in, the, adriatic, remains, minimal, however, proposed, export, oil, pipelines, were, objected, to, specifically, because, of, this, issue, oil, spills, are, a, major, concern, in, terms, of, potential, environmental, impact, and, damage, to, tourism, and, fisheries, it, is, estimated, that, if, a, major, oil, spill, happened, a, million, people, would, lose, their, livelihoods, in, croatia, alone, an, additional, risk, is, presented, by, oil, refineries, in, the, po, river, basin, where, oil, spills, have, occurred, before, in, addition, to, accidents, occurring, in, the, adriatic, already, so, far, with, no, significant, environmental, consequences, since, 2006, italy, has, been, considering, the, construction, of, an, offshore, and, an, onshore, lng, terminal, in, the, gulf, of, trieste, as, well, as, a, pipeline, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, slovenian, italian, border, the, slovenian, government, and, municipalities, the, municipal, council, of, trieste, and, non, governmental, organisations, have, voiced, concern, over, their, environmental, hazards, effect, on, transport, and, effect, on, tourism, another, source, of, pollution, of, the, adriatic, is, solid, waste, drifting, waste, occasionally, relatively, large, quantities, of, material, especially, waste, plastic, is, transported, northwest, by, the, sirocco, air, pollution, in, the, adriatic, basin, is, associated, with, the, large, industrial, centres, in, the, po, river, valley, and, the, large, industrial, cities, along, the, coast, italy, and, yugoslavia, established, a, joint, commission, to, protect, the, adriatic, sea, from, pollution, in, 1977, the, organization, later, changed, with, slovenia, croatia, and, montenegro, replacing, yugoslavia, future, pollution, hazards, are, addressed, and, pollution, hotspots, are, assessed, not, only, by, nations, in, the, basin, but, also, through, regional, projects, with, world, bank, support, 27, such, hotspots, have, been, determined, as, of, 2011, 6, warranting, an, urgent, response, settlements, along, the, adriatic, dating, to, between, 6100, and, 5900, bc, appear, in, albania, and, dalmatia, on, the, eastern, coast, related, to, the, cardium, pottery, culture, during, classical, antiquity, illyrians, inhabited, the, eastern, adriatic, coast, and, the, western, coast, was, inhabited, by, the, peoples, of, ancient, italy, mainly, etruscans, before, the, roman, republic, s, rise, greek, colonisation, of, the, adriatic, dates, back, to, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, when, epidamnos, and, apollonia, were, founded, the, greeks, soon, expanded, further, north, establishing, several, cities, including, ancona, black, corcyra, epidaurus, issa, with, trade, established, as, far, north, as, the, po, river, delta, where, the, emporion, trading, station, of, adria, was, founded, roman, economic, and, military, influence, in, the, region, began, to, grow, with, the, creation, by, 246, bc, of, a, major, naval, base, at, brundisium, now, brindisi, which, was, established, to, bar, carthaginian, ships, from, the, adriatic, during, the, punic, wars, this, led, to, conflict, with, the, illyrians, who, lived, in, a, collection, of, semi, hellenized, kingdoms, that, covered, much, of, the, balkans, and, controlled, the, eastern, shore, of, the, sea, resulting, in, the, illyrian, wars, from, 229, to, 168, bc, the, initial, roman, intervention, in, 229, bc, motivated, in, part, by, a, desire, to, suppress, illyrian, piracy, in, the, adriatic, marked, the, first, time, that, the, roman, navy, crossed, that, sea, to, launch, a, military, campaign, those, wars, ended, with, the, eastern, shore, becoming, a, province, of, the, roman, republic, however, resistance, to, roman, rule, continued, sporadically, and, rome, did, not, completely, consolidate, control, of, the, region, until, augustus, s, general, tiberius, put, down, the, great, illyrian, revolt, a, bitter, struggle, waged, from, 6, to, 9, ad, following, the, repression, of, the, revolt, the, roman, province, of, illyricum, was, split, into, dalmatia, and, pannonia, most, of, the, eastern, shore, of, the, adriatic, was, part, of, dalmatia, except, for, the, southernmost, portion, part, of, the, province, of, macedonia, and, the, peninsula, of, istria, on, the, northern, part, of, the, eastern, shore, istria, contained, the, important, roman, colony, at, pula, and, was, incorporated, into, the, province, of, italy, during, the, roman, period, brundisium, on, the, western, shore, and, apollonia, and, dyrrachium, originally, called, epidamnos, now, durr, s, in, albania, on, the, eastern, shore, became, important, ports, brundisium, was, linked, by, the, via, appia, road, to, the, city, of, rome, and, dyrrachium, and, apollonia, were, both, on, the, via, egnatia, a, road, that, by, about, 130, bc, the, romans, had, extended, eastward, across, the, balkans, to, byzantium, later, constantinople, now, istanbul, this, made, the, sea, passage, across, the, adriatic, between, brundisium, and, dyrrachium, or, apollonia, a, link, in, the, primary, route, for, travelers, trade, and, troop, movements, between, rome, and, the, east, this, route, played, a, major, role, in, some, of, the, military, operations, that, marked, the, end, of, the, roman, republic, and, the, start, of, the, imperial, period, sulla, used, it, during, the, first, mithridatic, war, during, caesar, s, civil, war, there, was, a, three, month, delay, in, caesar, s, balkan, campaign, against, pompey, caused, when, winter, storms, on, the, adriatic, and, a, naval, blockade, held, up, mark, antony, from, reaching, him, from, brundisium, with, reinforcements, after, the, reinforcements, finally, arrived, caesar, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, capture, dyrrachium, before, the, campaign, moved, inland, marc, antony, and, octavian, later, augustus, crossed, the, adriatic, to, dyrrachium, with, their, armies, in, their, campaign, against, two, of, caesar, s, assassins, brutus, and, cassius, that, culminated, in, the, battle, of, philippi, brundisium, and, dyrrachium, remained, important, ports, well, after, the, roman, period, but, an, earthquake, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, changed, the, path, of, a, river, causing, apollonia, s, harbor, to, silt, up, and, the, city, to, decline, another, city, on, the, italian, coast, of, the, adriatic, that, increased, in, importance, during, the, roman, era, was, ravenna, during, the, reign, of, augustus, it, became, a, major, naval, base, as, part, of, his, program, to, re, organize, the, roman, navy, to, better, protect, commerce, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, 4th, century, ad, the, emperors, of, the, western, roman, empire, had, moved, their, official, residence, north, from, rome, to, mediolanum, now, milan, in, order, to, be, better, able, to, control, the, military, frontier, with, the, germanic, tribes, in, 402, ad, during, a, period, of, repeated, germanic, invasions, of, italy, the, capital, was, shifted, to, ravenna, because, nearby, marshes, made, it, more, defensible, and, the, adriatic, provided, an, easy, escape, path, by, sea, when, the, western, empire, fell, in, 476, ad, ravenna, became, the, capital, of, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, of, italy, in, the, early, middle, ages, after, the, roman, empire, s, decline, the, adriatic, s, coasts, were, ruled, by, ostrogoths, lombards, and, the, byzantine, empire, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, ruled, italy, following, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, 476, ad, however, during, the, reign, of, justinian, the, byzantine, empire, sent, an, army, under, the, general, belisarius, to, regain, control, of, italy, resulting, in, the, gothic, war, 535, 554, the, byzantines, established, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, and, by, 553, ad, their, viceroy, exarch, ruled, almost, the, entire, italian, peninsula, from, that, city, in, 568, ad, the, lombards, invaded, northern, italy, and, over, the, course, of, the, next, century, or, so, the, importance, of, the, exarchate, declined, as, the, territory, under, lombard, control, expanded, and, as, the, byzantine, outpost, of, venice, became, increasingly, independent, in, 752, ad, the, lombards, overthrew, the, exarchate, ending, the, influence, of, the, byzantine, empire, on, the, western, shore, of, the, adriatic, for, a, few,
