the, blue, nile, is, a, river, originating, at, lake, tana, in, ethiopia, it, travels, for, approximately, 1, 450, km, 900, mi, through, ethiopia, and, sudan, along, with, the, white, nile, it, is, one, of, the, two, major, tributaries, of, the, nile, and, supplies, about, 85, 6, of, the, water, to, the, nile, during, the, rainy, season, the, distance, of, the, river, from, its, source, to, its, confluence, has, been, variously, reported, between, 1, 460, kilometres, 910, mi, and, 1, 600, kilometres, 990, mi, this, uncertainty, might, result, from, the, fact, that, the, river, flows, through, a, series, of, virtually, impenetrable, gorges, cut, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, to, a, depth, of, some, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, according, to, materials, published, by, the, central, statistical, agency, an, ethiopian, government, agency, the, blue, nile, has, a, total, length, of, 1, 450, kilometres, 900, mi, of, which, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, are, inside, ethiopia, the, blue, nile, originates, at, lake, tana, in, ethiopia, where, it, is, called, the, abay, river, the, river, flows, generally, south, before, entering, a, canyon, about, 400, km, 250, mi, long, about, 30, km, 19, mi, from, lake, tana, which, is, a, tremendous, obstacle, for, travel, and, communication, between, north, and, south, ethiopia, the, canyon, was, first, referred, to, as, the, grand, canyon, in, 1968, by, a, british, team, that, accomplished, the, first, descent, of, the, river, from, lake, tana, to, the, end, of, the, canyon, subsequent, river, rafting, parties, called, it, the, grand, canyon, of, the, nile, the, blue, nile, falls, amharic, tis, abay, literally, great, smoke, one, of, ethiopia, s, biggest, tourist, attractions, is, located, at, the, start, of, the, canyon, the, river, loops, across, northwest, ethiopia, before, being, fed, by, numerous, tributaries, between, lake, tana, and, the, ethiopia, sudan, border, those, on, its, left, bank, in, downstream, order, include, the, wanqa, river, the, bashilo, river, the, walaqa, river, the, wanchet, river, the, jamma, river, the, muger, river, the, guder, river, the, agwel, river, the, nedi, river, the, didessa, river, and, the, dabus, river, those, on, the, right, side, also, in, downstream, order, include, the, handassa, tul, abaya, sade, tammi, cha, shita, suha, muga, gulla, temcha, bachat, katlan, jiba, chamoga, weter, and, the, beles, the, blue, nile, then, heads, northwest, into, sudan, it, travels, for, approximately, 650, km, 400, mi, flowing, past, er, roseires, and, receiving, the, dinder, river, on, its, right, bank, at, dinder, at, khartoum, the, blue, nile, joins, the, white, nile, and, as, the, nile, flows, through, egypt, to, the, mediterranean, sea, at, alexandria, the, flow, of, the, blue, nile, reaches, maximum, volume, in, the, rainy, season, from, june, to, september, when, it, supplies, 80, 86, of, the, water, of, the, nile, proper, the, river, was, a, major, source, of, the, flooding, of, the, nile, in, egypt, that, contributed, to, the, fertility, of, the, nile, valley, and, the, consequent, rise, of, ancient, egypt, and, egyptian, mythology, with, the, completion, of, the, aswan, dam, in, 1970, these, floods, stopped, occurring, in, lower, egypt, during, the, summer, monsoon, season, the, blue, nile, floods, erode, a, vast, amount, of, fertile, soil, from, the, ethiopian, highlands, and, carry, it, downstream, as, silt, turning, the, water, dark, brown, or, almost, black, the, blue, nile, is, vital, to, the, livelihood, of, egypt, as, the, most, significant, tributary, of, the, nile, it, contributes, over, 85, of, the, nile, s, streamflow, though, shorter, than, the, white, nile, 59, of, the, water, that, reaches, egypt, originates, from, the, ethiopian, highlands, via, the, blue, nile, the, river, is, also, an, important, resource, for, sudan, where, the, roseires, dam, and, sennar, dam, contribute, to, the, 80, of, the, country, s, electricity, generation, from, hydropower, these, dams, also, help, irrigate, the, gezira, scheme, which, is, most, famous, for, its, high, quality, cotton, as, well, as, wheat, and, animal, feed, crop, production, in, the, area, in, november, 2012, ethiopia, began, construction, of, the, grand, ethiopian, renaissance, dam, a, 6000, megawatt, hydroelectric, dam, on, the, river, the, dam, is, expected, to, be, a, boost, for, the, ethiopian, economy, sudan, and, egypt, however, voiced, their, concerns, over, a, potential, reduction, in, water, available, electricity, generation, began, in, february, 2022, the, first, european, known, to, have, seen, the, blue, nile, in, ethiopia, and, the, river, s, source, was, pedro, p, ez, a, spanish, jesuit, who, reached, the, river, s, source, on, 21, april, 1618, however, the, portuguese, jo, o, bermudes, the, self, described, patriarch, of, ethiopia, provided, the, first, description, of, the, tis, abay, river, falls, in, his, memoirs, published, in, 1565, and, any, number, of, europeans, who, lived, in, ethiopia, in, the, late, 15th, century, such, as, p, ro, da, covilh, could, have, seen, the, river, long, before, p, ez, but, not, reached, its, source, the, source, of, the, nile, proper, was, also, reached, in, 1629, by, the, portuguese, jesuit, missionary, jer, nimo, lobo, and, in, 1770, by, the, scottish, explorer, james, bruce, although, european, explorers, contemplated, tracing, the, course, of, the, nile, from, the, blue, nile, s, confluence, with, the, white, nile, to, lake, tana, the, blue, nile, canyon, has, discouraged, all, attempts, since, fr, d, ric, cailliaud, s, attempt, in, 1821, the, first, serious, attempt, by, a, non, local, to, explore, this, reach, of, the, river, was, undertaken, by, the, american, w, w, macmillan, in, 1902, assisted, by, the, norwegian, explorer, b, h, jenssen, jenssen, proceeded, upriver, from, khartoum, while, macmillan, sailed, downstream, from, lake, tana, however, jenssen, s, boats, were, blocked, by, the, rapids, at, famaka, short, of, the, sudan, ethiopia, border, and, macmillan, s, boats, were, wrecked, shortly, after, they, had, been, launched, macmillan, encouraged, jenssen, to, try, to, sail, upstream, from, khartoum, again, in, 1905, but, he, was, forced, to, stop, 500, km, 300, mi, short, of, lake, tana, robert, cheesman, who, records, his, surprise, on, arriving, in, ethiopia, at, finding, that, the, upper, waters, of, one, of, the, most, famous, of, the, rivers, of, the, world, and, one, whose, name, was, well, known, to, the, ancients, was, in, his, lifetime, marked, on, the, map, by, dotted, lines, managed, to, map, the, upper, course, of, the, blue, nile, between, 1925, and, 1933, he, did, this, not, by, following, the, river, along, its, banks, and, through, its, impassable, canyon, but, by, following, it, from, the, highlands, above, travelling, some, 8, 000, km, 5, 000, mi, by, mule, in, the, adjacent, country, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, several, kayakers, paddled, parts, of, the, canyon, in, 1968, at, the, request, of, haile, selassie, a, team, of, 60, british, and, ethiopian, servicemen, and, scientists, made, the, first, full, descent, of, the, river, from, lake, tana, to, a, point, near, the, sudanese, border, led, by, explorer, john, blashford, snell, the, team, used, specially, built, avon, inflatables, and, modified, royal, engineers, assault, boats, to, navigate, the, formidable, rapids, subsequent, rafting, expeditions, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, generally, only, covered, parts, of, the, river, canyon, in, 1999, writer, virginia, morell, and, photographer, nevada, wier, made, the, journey, by, raft, from, lake, tana, to, sudan, publishing, a, documentary, about, their, journey, afterwards, in, 2000, american, and, national, geographic, reader, kenneth, frantz, saw, a, photo, taken, by, nevada, wier, for, national, geographic, which, would, lead, him, to, found, the, charity, bridges, to, prosperity, this, photo, showed, a, bridge, broken, during, world, war, ii, with, 10, men, on, either, side, of, the, broken, span, pulling, each, other, across, the, dangerous, gap, by, rope, this, historic, bridge, was, built, by, emperor, fasilides, in, approximately, 1660, with, roman, bridge, technology, brought, to, ethiopia, by, portuguese, soldiers, during, the, battle, with, the, muslim, invaders, in, 1507, in, both, 2001, and, 2009, bridges, to, prosperity, volunteers, travelled, from, the, united, states, to, repair, the, broken, bridge, across, the, blue, nile, and, later, built, a, new, suspension, bridge, not, susceptible, to, flood, on, 28, april, 2004, geologist, pasquale, scaturro, and, his, partner, kayaker, and, documentary, filmmaker, gordon, brown, became, the, first, known, people, to, navigate, the, blue, nile, in, its, entirety, though, their, expedition, included, several, others, brown, and, scaturro, were, the, only, ones, to, remain, on, the, expedition, for, the, entire, journey, they, chronicled, their, adventure, with, an, imax, camera, and, two, handheld, video, cameras, sharing, their, story, in, the, film, mystery, of, the, nile, and, in, a, book, of, the, same, title, on, 29, january, 2005, canadian, les, jickling, and, his, teammate, new, zealander, mark, tanner, completed, the, first, fully, human, powered, transit, of, the, entire, blue, nile, and, the, nile, in, the, sudan, and, egypt, their, journey, of, over, 5, 000, km, 3, 100, mi, took, five, months, and, traveled, through, ethiopia, sudan, and, egypt, they, recount, that, they, paddled, through, civil, war, conflict, zones, regions, known, for, bandits, and, encountered, multiple, hazards, and, rapids, 12, 00, n, 037, 15, e, 12, 000, n, 37, 250, e,
