for, short, periods, and, can, take, temperatures, below, 10, c, 14, f, even, at, sea, level, arctic, outflow, winds, can, occasionally, result, in, wind, chill, temperatures, at, or, even, below, 17,

hampered, by, insufficient, funds, which, together, with, the, continuous, opposition, of, governor, james, douglas, whom, sir, thomas, frederick, elliot, 1808, 1880, described, as, like, any, other, fraud, made, it, impossible, for, design, to, be, fulfilled, 27, moody, and, the, royal, engineers, also, built, an, extensive, road, network, including, what, would, become, kingsway, connecting,

this, gold, rush, the, character, of, the, colony, was, changing, as, a, more, stable, population, of, british, colonists, settled, in, the, region, establishing, businesses, opening, sawmills, and, engaging, in, fishing, and, agriculture, with, this, increased, stability, objections, to, the, colony, s, absentee, governor, and, the, lack, of, responsible, government, began, to, be, vocalized, led, by, the, influential, editor, of, the, new, westminster, british, columbian, and, future, premier, john, robson, a, series, of, petitions, requesting, an, assembly, were, ignored, by, douglas, and, the, colonial, office, until, douglas, was, eased, out, of, office, in, 1864, finally, the, colony, would, have, both, an, assembly, and, a, resident, governor, a, series, of, gold, rushes, in, various, parts, of, the, province, followed, the, largest, being, the, cariboo, gold, rush, in, 1862, forcing, the, colonial, administration, into, deeper, debt, as, it, struggled, to, meet, the,
