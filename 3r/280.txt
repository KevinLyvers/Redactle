japanese, government, objected, to, the, islands, being, included, under, the, name, ryukyu, in, english, because, they, worried, that, this, might, mean, that, the, return, of, the, amami, islands, to, japanese, control, would, be, delayed, until, the, return, of, okinawa, however, the, american, occupational, government, on, amami, continued, to, be, called, the, provisional, government, for,

the, article, of, 682, according, to, the, shoku, nihongi, 797, the, imperial, court, dispatched, armed, officers, in, 698, to, explore, the, southern, islands, as, a, result, people, of, tane, yaku, amami, and, dokan, visited, the, capital, then, fujiwara, ky, to, pay, tribute, in, the, next, year, historians, identify, dokan, as, tokunoshima, of, the, amami, islands, an, article, of, 714,

islands, some, identify, kumi, as, iriomote, island, of, the, yaeyama, islands, because, komi, is, an, older, name, for, iriomote, others, consider, that, kumi, corresponded, to, kume, island, of, the, okinawa, islands, around, this, time, southern, islands, replaced, yaku, as, a, collective, name, for, the, southern, islands, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, northern, end, of, the, island,

into, sumi, province, ancient, japan, s, commitment, to, the, southern, islands, is, attributed, to, ideological, and, strategic, factors, japan, applied, to, herself, the, chinese, ideology, of, emperorship, that, required, barbarian, people, who, longed, for, the, great, virtue, of, the, emperor, thus, japan, treated, people, on, its, periphery, i, e, the, emishi, to, the, east, and, the, hayato, and, the, southern, islanders, to, the, south, as, barbarians, the, imperial, court, brought, some, of, them, to, the, capital, to, serve, the, emperor, the, new, book, of, tang, 1060, states, at, the, end, of, the, chapter, of, japan, that, there, were, three, little, princes, of, yaku, haya, and, tane, this, statement, should, have, been, based, on, a, report, by, japanese, envoys, in, the, early, 8th, century, who, would, have, claimed, the, japanese, emperor, s, virtue, at, the, site, of, dazaifu, the, administrative, center, of, kyushu, two, wooden, tags, dated, in, the, early, 8th, century, were, unearthed, in, 1984, which, read, amami, island, amamijima, and, iran, island, iran, no, shima, respectively, the, latter, seems, to, correspond, to, okinoerabu, island, these,

had, strategic, importance, for, japan, because, they, were, on, one, of, the, three, major, routes, used, by, japanese, missions, to, tang, china, 630, 840, the, 702, mission, seems, to, have, been, the, first, to, successfully, switch, from, the, earlier, route, via, korea, to, the, southern, island, route, the, missions, of, 714, 733, and, 752, probably, took, the, same, route, in, 754, the, chinese, monk, jianzhen, managed, to, reach, japan, his, biography, t, daiwaj, t, seiden, 779, makes, reference, to, akonaha, on, the, route, which, may, refer, to, modern, day, okinawa, island, an, article, of, 754, states, that, the, government, repaired, mileposts, that, had, originally, been, set, in, the, southern, islands, in, 735, however, the, missions, from, 777, onward, chose, another, route, that, directly, connected, ky, sh, to, china, thereafter, the, central, government, lost, its, interest, in, the, southern, islands, the, southern, islands, reappeared, in, written, history,

island, kikashima, to, arrest, the, nanban, this, is, the, first, attested, use, of, kikaigashima, which, is, often, used, in, subsequent, sources, the, series, of, reports, suggest, that, there, were, groups, of, people, with, advanced, sailing, technology, in, amami, and, that, dazaifu, had, a, stronghold, on, kikai, island, in, fact, historians, hypothesize, that, the, amami, islands, were, incorporated, into, a, trade, network, that, connected, it, to, ky, sh, song, china, and, goryeo, in, fact, the, sh, y, ki, recorded, that, in, the, 1020s, local, governors, of, southern, ky, sh, presented, to, the, author, a, court, aristocrat, local, specialties, of, the, southern, islands, including, the, chinese, fan, palm, redwoods, and, shells, of, green, turban, shell, the,
