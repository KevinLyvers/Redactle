which, for, many, centuries, controlled, the, indian, ocean, gold, trade, and, eventually, came, under, the, ajuran, sultanate, in, the, 13th, century, which, was, an, important, player, in, the, medieval, silk, road, maritime, trade, mogadishu, enjoyed, the, height, of, its, prosperity, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, and, was, during, the, early, modern, period, considered, the,

during, siad, barre, s, presidency, 1969, 1991, the, three, decade, long, somali, civil, war, afterwards, devastated, the, city, as, of, the, late, 2010s, and, 2020s, a, period, of, major, reconstruction, commenced, the, origins, of, the, name, mogadishu, muqdisho, have, many, theories, but, it, is, most, likely, derived, from, a, morphology, of, the, somali, words, muuq, and, disho, which, mean, sight, killer, or, blinder, possibly, referring, to, the, city, s, blinding, beauty, magh, ad, e, sh, h, persian, is, another, phrase, from, which, the, name, of, mogadishu, is, believed, to, be, derived, meaning, seat, of, the, shah, merchant, shah, which, reflects, the, city, s, early, persian, influence, the, arabic, mads, meaning, hallowed, place, may, also, be, a, root, after, establishment, the, 16th, century, explorer, leo, africanus, knew, the, city, as, magadazo, alt, magadoxo, the, ancient, city, of, sarapion, is, believed, to, have, been, the, predecessor, state, of, mogadishu, it, is, mentioned, in, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, a, greek, travel, document, dating, from, the, first, century, ad, as, one, of, a, series, of, commercial, ports, on, the, somali, littoral, according, to, the, periplus, maritime, trade, already, connected, peoples, in, the, mogadishu, area, with, other, communities, along, the, indian, ocean, during, ancient, times, mogadishu, was, part, of, the, somali, city, states, that, engaged, in, a, lucrative, trade, network, connecting, somali, merchants, with, phoenicia, ptolemic, egypt, greece, parthian, persia, sabaeans, nabataea, and, the, roman, empire, somali, sailors, used, the, ancient, somali, maritime, vessel, known, as, the, beden, to, transport, their, cargo, the, founding, ethnicity, of, mogadishu, and, its, subsequent, sultanate, has, been, a, topic, of, intrigue, in, somali, studies, ioan, lewis, and, enrico, cerulli, believed, that, the, city, was, founded, and, ruled, by, a, council, of, arab, and, persian, families, however, the, reference, i, m, lewis, and, cerulli, received, traces, back, to, one, 19th, century, text, called, the, kitab, al, zunuj, which, has, been, discredited, by, modern, scholars, as, unreliable, and, unhistorical, more, importantly, it, contradicts, oral, ancient, written, sources, and, archaeological, evidence, on, the, pre, existing, civilizations, and, communities, that, flourished, on, the, somali, coast, and, to, which, were, the, forefathers, of, mogadishu, and, other, coastal, cities, thus, the, persian, and, arab, founding, myths, are, regarded, as, an, outdated, false, colonialist, reflection, on, africans, ability, to, create, their, own, sophisticated, states, it, has, now, been, widely, accepted, that, there, were, already, communities, on, the, somali, coast, with, ethnic, somali, leadership, to, whom, the, arab, and, persian, families, had, to, ask, for, permission, to, settle, in, their, cities, it, also, seems, the, local, somalis, retained, their, political, and, numerical, superiority, on, the, coast, while, the, muslim, immigrants, would, go, through, an, assimilation, process, by, adopting, the, local, language, and, culture, mogadishu, along, with, zeila, and, other, somali, coastal, cities, was, founded, upon, an, indigenous, network, involving, hinterland, trade, and, that, happened, even, before, significant, arab, migrations, or, trade, with, the, somali, coast, that, goes, back, approximately, four, thousand, years, and, are, supported, by, archaeological, and, textual, evidences, this, is, corroborated, by, the, first, century, ad, greek, document, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, detailing, multiple, prosperous, port, cities, in, ancient, somalia, as, well, as, the, identification, of, ancient, sarapion, with, the, city, that, would, later, be, known, as, mogadishu, when, ibn, battuta, visited, the, sultanate, in, the, 14th, century, he, identified, the, sultan, as, being, of, barbara, origin, an, ancient, term, to, describe, the, ancestors, of, the, somali, people, according, to, ross, e, dunn, neither, mogadishu, or, any, other, city, on, the, coast, could, be, considered, alien, enclaves, of, arabs, or, persians, but, were, in, fact, african, towns, yaqut, al, hamawi, a, muslim, medieval, geographer, in, the, year, 1220, describes, mogadishu, as, the,

towns, ibn, al, mujawir, mentions, the, banu, majid, who, fled, the, mundhiriya, region, in, yemen, in, the, year, 1159, and, settled, in, mogadishu, and, also, traders, from, the, port, towns, of,

a, global, history, of, many, places, he, visited, mogadishu, and, called, it, the, richest, and, most, powerful, city, in, the, region, and, was, an, islamic, center, across, the, indian, ocean,
