islands, that, also, includes, the, autonomous, region, of, bougainville, currently, a, part, of, papua, new, guinea, but, excludes, the, santa, cruz, islands, the, islands, have, been, settled, since, at, least, some, time, between, 30, 000, and, 28, 800, bc, with, later, waves, of, migrants, notably, the, lapita, people, mixing, and, producing, the, modern, indigenous, solomon, islanders, population, in, 1568, the, spanish, navigator, lvaro, de, menda, a, was, the, first, european, to, visit, them, though, not, named, by, menda, a, it, is, believed, that, the, islands, were, called, the, solomons, by, those, who, later, received, word, of, his, voyage, and, mapped, his, discovery, menda, a, returned, decades, later, in, 1595, and, another, spanish, expedition, led, by, portuguese, navigator, pedro, fernandes, de, queir, s, visited, the, solomons, in, 1606, in, june, 1893, captain, herbert, gibson, of, hms, curacoa, declared, the, southern, solomon, islands, a, british, protectorate, during, world, war, ii, the, solomon, islands, campaign, 1942, 1945, saw, fierce, fighting, between, the, united, states, british, imperial, forces, and, the, empire, of, japan, including, the, battle, of, guadalcanal, the, official, name, of, the, then, british, administration, was, changed, from, the, british, solomon, islands, protectorate, to, the, solomon, islands, in, 1975, and, self, government, was, achieved, the, following, year, independence, was, obtained, and, the, name, changed, to, just, solomon, islands, without, the, definite, article, in, 1978, at,

the, advice, of, the, prime, minister, in, 1568, the, spanish, navigator, lvaro, de, menda, a, was, the, first, european, to, visit, the, solomon, islands, archipelago, but, did, not, name, the, archipelago, at, that, time, only, certain, individual, islands, though, not, named, by, menda, a, the, islands, were, subsequently, referred, to, as, islas, salom, n, solomon, islands, by, others, following, reports, of, his, voyage, optimistically, conflated, with, stories, of, the, wealthy, biblical, king, solomon, believing, them, to, be, the, bible, mentioned, city, of, ophir, during, most, of, the, colonial, period, the, territory, s, official, name, was, the, british, solomon, islands, protectorate, until, independence, in, 1978, when, it, was, changed, to, solomon, islands, as, defined, in, the, constitution, of, solomon, islands, and, as, a, commonwealth, realm, under, this, name, the, definite, article, the, has, not, been, part, of, the, country, s, official, name, since, independence, but, remains, for, all, references, to, the, area, pre, independence, and, is, sometimes, used, both, within, and, outside, the, country, colloquially, the, islands, are, referred, to, simply, as, the, solomons, the, solomons, were, first, settled, by, people, coming, from, the, bismarck, islands, and, new, guinea, during, the, pleistocene, era, c, 30, 000, 28, 000, bc, based, on, archaeological, evidence, found, at, kilu, cave, on, buka, island, in, the, autonomous, region, of, bougainville, papua, new, guinea, at, this, point, sea, levels, were, lower, and, buka, and, bougainville, were, physically, joined, to, the, southern, solomons, in, one, landmass, greater, bougainville, though, it, is, unclear, precisely, how, far, south, these, early, settlers, spread, as, no, other, archaeological, sites, from, this, period, have, been, found, as, sea, levels, rose, as, the, ice, age, ended, c, 4000, 3500, bc, the, greater, bougainville, landmass, split, into, the, numerous, islands, that, exist, today, evidence, of, later, human, settlements, dating, to, c, 4500, 2500, bc, have, been, found, at, poha, cave, and, vatuluma, posovi, cave, on, guadalcanal, the, ethnic, identity, of, these, early, peoples, is, unclear, though, it, is, thought, that, the, speakers, of, the, central, solomon, languages, a, self, contained, language, family, unrelated, to, other, languages, spoken, in, the, solomons, likely, represent, the, descendants, of, these, earlier, settlers, from, c, 1200, 800, bc, austronesian, lapita, people, began, arriving, from, the, bismarcks, with, their, characteristic, ceramics, evidence, for, their, presence, has, been, found, across, the, solomon, archipelago, as, well, at, the, santa, cruz, islands, in, the, south, east, with, different, islands, being, settled, at, different, times, linguistic, and, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, the, lapita, people, leap, frogged, the, already, inhabited, main, solomon, islands, and, settled, first, on, the, santa, cruz, group, with, later, back, migrations, bringing, their, culture, to, the, main, group, these, peoples, mixed, with, the, native, solomon, islanders, and, over, time, their, languages, became, dominant, with, most, of, the, 60, 70, languages, spoken, there, belonging, to, the, oceanic, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, then, as, now, communities, tended, to, exist, in, small, villages, practising, subsistence, agriculture, though, extensive, inter, island, trade, networks, existed, numerous, ancient, burial, sites, and, other, evidence, of, permanent, settlements, have, been, found, from, the, period, ad, 1000, 1500, throughout, the, islands, one, of, the, most, prominent, examples, being, the, roviana, cultural, complex, centred, on, the, islands, off, the, southern, coast, of, new, georgia, where, a, large, number, of, megalithic, shrines, and, other, structures, were, constructed, in, the, 13th, century, the, people, of, solomon, islands, were, notorious, for, headhunting, and, cannibalism, before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, the, first, european, to, visit, the, islands, was, the, spanish, navigator, lvaro, de, menda, a, de, neira, sailing, from, peru, in, 1568, landing, on, santa, isabel, on, 7, february, menda, a, explored, several, of, the, other, islands, including, makira, guadalcanal, and, malaita, relations, with, the, native, solomon, islanders, were, initially, cordial, although, they, often, soured, as, time, went, by, as, a, result, menda, a, returned, to, peru, in, august, 1568, he, returned, to, the, solomons, with, a, larger, crew, on, a, second, voyage, in, 1595, aiming, to, colonise, the, islands, they, landed, on, nend, in, the, santa, cruz, islands, and, established, a, small, settlement, at, gracioso, bay, however, the, settlement, failed, due, to, poor, relations, with, the, native, peoples, and, epidemics, of, disease, amongst, the, spanish, which, caused, numerous, deaths, with, menda, a, himself, dying, in, october, the, new, commander, pedro, fernandes, de, queir, s, thus, decided, to, abandon, the, settlement, and, they, sailed, north, to, the, spanish, territory, of, the, philippines, queir, s, later, returned, to, the, area, in, 1606, where, he, sighted, tikopia, and, taumako, though, this, voyage, was, primarily, to, vanuatu, in, the, search, of, terra, australis, save, for, abel, tasman, s, sighting, of, the, remote, ontong, java, atoll, in, 1648, no, european, sailed, to, the, solomons, again, until, 1767, when, the, british, explorer, philip, carteret, sailed, by, the, santa, cruz, islands, malaita, and, continuing, further, north, bougainville, and, the, bismarck, islands, french, explorers, also, reached, the, solomons, with, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, naming, choiseul, in, 1768, and, jean, fran, ois, de, surville, exploring, the, islands, in, 1769, in, 1788, john, shortland, captaining, a, supply, ship, for, britain, s, new, australian, colony, at, botany, bay, sighted, the, treasury, and, shortland, islands, that, same, year, the, french, explorer, jean, fran, ois, de, la, p, rouse, was, wrecked, on, vanikoro, a, rescue, expedition, led, by, bruni, d, entrecasteaux, sailed, to, vanikoro, but, found, no, trace, of, la, p, rouse, the, fate, of, la, p, rouse, was, not, confirmed, until, 1826, when, the, english, merchant, peter, dillon, visited, tikopia, and, discovered, items, belonging, to, la, p, rouse, in, the, possession, of, the, local, people, confirmed, by, the, subsequent, voyage, of, jules, dumont, d, urville, in, 1828, some, of, the, earliest, regular, foreign, visitors, to, the, islands, were, whaling, vessels, from, britain, the, united, states, and, australia, they, came, for, food, wood, and, water, from, late, in, the, 18th, century, establishing, a, trading, relationship, with, the, solomon, islanders, and, later, taking, aboard, islanders, to, serve, as, crewmen, on, their, ships, relations, between, the, islanders, and, visiting, seamen, were, not, always, good, and, sometimes, there, was, bloodshed, a, knock, on, effect, of, the, greater, european, contact, was, the, spread, of, diseases, to, which, local, peoples, had, no, immunity, as, well, as, a, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, between, coastal, groups, who, had, access, to, european, weapons, and, technology, and, inland, groups, who, did, not, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1800s, more, traders, arrived, seeking, turtleshells, sea, cucumbers, copra, and, sandalwood, occasionally, establishing, semi, permanent, trading, stations, however, initial, attempts, at, more, long, term, settlement, such, as, benjamin, boyd, s, colony, on, guadalcanal, in, 1851, were, unsuccessful, beginning, in, the, 1840s, and, accelerating, in, the, 1860s, islanders, began, to, be, recruited, or, often, kidnapped, as, labourers, for, the, colonies, in, australia, fiji, and, samoa, in, a, process, known, as, blackbirding, conditions, for, workers, were, often, poor, and, exploitative, and, local, islanders, often, violently, attacked, any, europeans, who, appeared, on, their, island, the, blackbird, trade, was, chronicled, by, prominent, western, writers, such, as, joe, melvin, and, jack, london, christian, missionaries, also, began, visiting, the, solomons, from, the, 1840s, beginning, with, an, attempt, by, french, catholics, under, jean, baptiste, epalle, to, establish, a, mission, on, santa, isabel, which, was, abandoned, after, epalle, was, killed, by, islanders, in, 1845, anglican, missionaries, began, arriving, from, the, 1850s, followed, by, other, denominations, over, time, gaining, a, large, number, of, converts, in, 1884, germany, annexed, northeast, new, guinea, and, the, bismarck, archipelago, and, in, 1886, extended, its, rule, over, the, north, solomon, islands, covering, bougainville, buka, choiseul, santa, isabel, the, shortlands, and, ontong, java, atoll, in, 1886, germany, and, britain, confirmed, this, arrangement, with, the, british, gaining, a, sphere, of, influence, over, the, southern, solomons, germany, paid, little, attention, to, the, islands, with, german, authorities, based, in, new, guinea, not, even, visiting, the, area, until, 1888, the, german, presence, along, with, pressure, from, the, missionaries, to, rein, in, the, excesses, of, the, coercive, labour, recruitment, practices, known, as, blackbirding, prompted, the, british, to, declare, a, protectorate, over, the, southern, solomons, in, march, 1893, initially, encompassing, new, georgia, malaita, guadalcanal, makira, mono, island, and, the, central, nggela, islands, in, april, 1896, colonial, official, charles, morris, woodford, was, appointed, as, the, british, acting, deputy, commissioner, and, he, was, confirmed, in, his, position, in, the, following, year, the, colonial, office, appointed, woodford, as, the, resident, commissioner, in, the, solomon, islands, on, 17, february, 1897, he, was, directed, to, control, the, coercive, labour, recruitment, practices, known, as, blackbirding, operating, in, the, solomon, island, waters, and, to, stop, the, illegal, trade, in, firearms, woodford, set, up, an, administrative, headquarters, on, the, small, island, of, tulagi, and, in, 1898, and, 1899, the, rennell, and, bellona, islands, sikaiana, the, santa, cruz, islands, and, outlying, islands, such, as, anuta, fataka, temotu, and, tikopia, were, added, to, the, protectorate, in, 1900, under, the, terms, of, the, tripartite, convention, of, 1899, germany, ceded, the, northern, solomon, to, britain, minus, buka, and, bougainville, the, latter, becoming, part, of, german, new, guinea, despite, geographically, belonging, to, the, solomons, archipelago, woodford, s, underfunded, administration, struggled, to, maintain, law, and, order, on, the, remote, colony, from, the, late, 1890s, until, the, early, 1900s, there, were, numerous, instances, of, european, merchants, and, colonists, being, killed, by, islanders, the, british, response, was, to, deploy, royal, navy, warships, to, launch, punitive, expeditions, against, the, villages, which, were, responsible, for, the, murders, arthur, mahaffy, was, appointed, at, the, deputy, commissioner, in, january, 1898, he, was, based, in, gizo, his, duties, included, suppressing, headhunting, in, new, georgia, and, neighbouring, islands, the, british, colonial, government, attempted, to, encourage, the, establishment, of, plantations, by, colonists, however, by, 1902, there, were, only, about, 80, european, colonists, residing, on, the, islands, attempts, at, economic, development, met, with, mixed, results, though, levers, pacific, plantations, ltd, a, subsidiary, of, lever, brothers, managed, to, establish, a, profitable, copra, plantation, industry, which, employed, many, islanders, small, scale, mining, and, logging, industries, were, also, developed, however, the, colony, remained, something, of, a, backwater, with, education, medical, and, other, social, services, being, under, the, administration, of, the, missionaries, violence, also, continued, most, notably, with, the, murder, of, colonial, administrator, william, r, bell, by, basiana, of, the, kwaio, people, on, malaita, in, 1927, as, bell, attempted, to, enforce, an, unpopular, head, tax, several, kwaio, were, killed, in, a, retaliatory, raid, and, basiana, and, his, accomplices, executed, from, 1942, until, the, end, of, 1943, the, solomon, islands, were, the, scene, of, several, major, land, sea, and, air, battles, between, the, allies, and, the, japanese, empire, s, armed, forces, following, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, 1941, war, was, declared, between, japan, and, the, allied, powers, and, the, japanese, seeking, to, protect, their, southern, flank, invaded, south, east, asia, and, new, guinea, in, may,

followed, by, the, new, georgia, campaign, in, 1943, both, of, which, were, turning, points, in, the, pacific, war, stopping, and, then, countering, the, japanese, advance, the, conflict, resulted, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, allied, japanese, and, civilian, deaths, as, well, an, immense, destruction, across, the, islands, the, solomon, islands, campaign, cost, the, allies, approximately,

and, some, 6, 000, enlisted, in, the, british, solomon, islands, protectorate, defence, force, with, their, exposure, to, the, americans, leading, to, several, social, and, political, transformations, for, example, the, americans, had, extensively, developed, honiara, with, the, capital, shifting, there, from, tulagi, in, 1952, and, the, pijin, language, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, communication, between, americans, and, the, islands, inhabitants, in, 1943, 44, the, malaita, based, chief, aliki, nono, ohimae, had, founded, the, maasina, rule, movement, aka, the, native, council, movement, literally, brotherhood, rule, and, was, later, joined, by, another, chief, hoasihau, their, aims, were, to, improve, the, economic, well, being, of, native, solomon, islanders, gain, greater, autonomy, and, to, act, as, a, liaison, between, islanders, and, the, colonial, administration, the, movement, was, especially, popular, with, ex, labour, corp, members, and, after, the, war, its, numbers, swelled, with, the, movement, spreading, to, other, islands, alarmed, at, the, growth, of, the, movement, the, british, launched, operation, de, louse, in, 1947, 8, and, arrested, most, of, the, maasina, leaders, malaitans, then, organised, a, campaign, of, civil, disobedience, prompting, mass, arrests, in, 1950, a, new, resident, commissioner, henry, gregory, smith, arrived, and, released, the, leaders, of, the, movement, though, the, disobedience, campaign, continued, in, 1952, new, high, commissioner, later, governor, robert, stanley, met, with, leaders, of, the, movement, and, agreed, to, the, creation, of, an, island, council, in, late, 1952, stanley, formally, moved, the, capital, of, the, territory, to, honiara, in, the, early, 1950s, the, possibility, of, transferring, sovereignty, of, the, islands, to, australia, was, discussed, by, the, british, and, australian, governments, however, the, australians, were, reluctant, to, accept, the, financial, burden, of, administering, the, territory, and, the, idea, was, shelved, with, decolonisation, sweeping, the, colonial, world, and, britain, no, longer, willing, or, able, to, bear, the, financial, burdens, of, the, empire, the, colonial, authorities, sought, to, prepare, the, solomons, for, self, governance, appointed, executive, and, legislative, councils, were, established, in, 1960, with, a, degree, of, elected, solomon, islander, representation, introduced, in, 1964, and, then, extended, in, 1967, a, new, constitution, was, drawn, up, in, 1970, which, merged, the, two, councils, into, one, governing, council, though, the, british, governor, still, retained, extensive, powers, discontent, with, this, prompted, the, creation, of, a, new, constitution, in, 1974, which, reduced, much, of, the, governor, s, remaining, powers, and, created, the, post, of, chief, minister, first, held, by, solomon, mamaloni, full, self, government, for, the, territory, was, achieved, in, 1976, a, year, after, the, independence, of, neighbouring, papua, new, guinea, from, australia, meanwhile, discontent, grew, in, the, western, islands, with, many, fearing, marginalisation, in, future, a, honiara, or, malaita, dominated, state, prompting, the, formation, of, the, western, breakaway, movement, a, conference, held, in, london, in, 1977, agreed, that, the, solomons, would, gain, full, independence, the, following, year, under, the, terms, of, the, solomon, islands, act, 1978, the, country, was, annexed, to, her, majesty, s, dominions, and, granted, independence, on, 7, july, 1978, the, first, prime, minister, was, sir, peter, kenilorea, of, the, solomon, islands, united, party, siup, with, elizabeth, ii, becoming, queen, of, solomon, islands, represented, locally, by, a, governor, general, peter, kenilorea, went, on, to, win, the, 1980, solomon, islands, general, election, serving, as, pm, until, 1981, when, he, was, replaced, by, solomon, mamaloni, of, the, people, s, alliance, party, pap, after, a, no, confidence, vote, mamaloni, created, the, central, bank, and, national, airline, and, pushed, for, greater, autonomy, for, individual, islands, of, the, country, kenilorea, returned, to, power, after, winning, the, 1984, election, though, his, second, term, lasted, only, two, years, before, he, was, replaced, by, ezekiel, alebua, following, allegations, of, misuse, of, french, aid, money, in, 1986, the, solomons, helped, found, the, melanesian, spearhead, group, aimed, at, fostering, cooperation, and, trade, in, the, region, after, winning, the, 1989, election, mamaloni, and, the, pap, returned, to, power, with, mamaloni, dominating, solomon, islands, politics, from, the, early, to, mid, 1990s, save, for, the, one, year, premiership, of, francis, billy, hilly, mamaloni, made, efforts, to, make, the, solomons, a, republic, however, these, were, unsuccessful, he, also, had, to, deal, with, the, effects, of, the, conflict, in, neighbouring, bougainville, which, broke, out, in, 1988, causing, many, refugees, to, flee, to, the, solomons, tensions, arose, with, papua, new, guinea, as, png, forces, frequently, entered, solomons, territory, in, the, pursuit, of, rebels, the, situation, calmed, down, and, relations, improved, following, the, end, of, the, conflict, in, 1998, meanwhile, the, country, s, financial, situation, continued, to, deteriorate, with, much, of, the, budget, coming, from, the, logging, industry, often, conducted, at, an, unsustainable, rate, not, helped, by, mamaloni, s, creation, of, a, discretionary, fund, for, use, by, politicians, which, fostered, fraud, and, corruption, discontent, with, his, rule, led, to, a, split, in, the, pap, and, mamaloni, lost, the, 1993, election, to, billy, hilly, though, hilly, was, later, sacked, by, the, governor, general, after, a, number, of, defections, caused, him, to, lose, his, majority, allowing, mamaloni, to, return, to, power, in, 1994, where, he, remained, until, 1997, excessive, logging, government, corruption, and, unsustainable, levels, of, public, spending, continued, to, grow, and, public, discontent, caused, mamaloni, to, lose, the, 1997, election, the, new, prime, minister, bartholomew, ulufa, alu, of, the, solomon, islands, liberal, party, attempted, to, enact, economic, reforms, however, his, premiership, soon, became, engulfed, in, a, serious, ethnic, conflict, known, as, the, tensions, military, stalemate, commonly, referred, to, as, the, tensions, or, the, ethnic, tension, the, initial, civil, unrest, was, mainly, characterised, by, fighting, between, the, isatabu, freedom, movement, ifm, also, known, as, the, guadalcanal, revolutionary, army, and, the, isatabu, freedom, fighters, and, the, malaita, eagle, force, as, well, as, the, marau, eagle, force, for, many, years, people, from, the, island, of, malaita, had, been, migrating, to, honiara, and, guadalcanal, attracted, primarily, by, the, greater, economic, opportunities, available, there, the, large, influx, caused, tensions, with, native, guadalcanal, islanders, known, as, guales, and, in, late, 1998, the, ifm, was, formed, and, began, a, campaign, of, intimidation, and, violence, towards, malaitan, settlers, thousands, of, malaitans, subsequently, fled, back, to, malaita, or, to, honiara, and, in, mid, 1999, the, malaita, eagle, force, mef, was, established, to, protect, malaitans, on, guadalcanal, in, late, 1999, after, several, failed, attempts, at, brokering, a, peace, deal, prime, minister, bartholomew, ulufa, alu, declared, a, four,
