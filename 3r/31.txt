the, antarctic, circle, is, the, most, southerly, of, the, five, major, circles, of, latitude, that, mark, maps, of, earth, the, region, south, of, this, circle, is, known, as, the, antarctic, and, the, zone, immediately, to, the, north, is, called, the, southern, temperate, zone, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, the, sun, is, above, the, horizon, for, 24, continuous, hours, at, least, once, per, year, and, therefore, visible, at, midnight, and, the, centre, of, the, sun, ignoring, refraction, is, below, the, horizon, for, 24, continuous, hours, at, least, once, per, year, and, therefore, not, visible, at, noon, this, is, also, true, within, the, equivalent, polar, circle, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, arctic, circle, the, position, of, the, antarctic, circle, is, not, fixed, and, currently, runs, 66, 33, 50, 1, south, of, the, equator, this, figure, may, be, slightly, inaccurate, because, it, does, not, allow, for, the, effects, of, astronomical, nutation, which, can, be, up, to, 10, its, latitude, depends, on, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, which, fluctuates, within, a, margin, of, more, than, 2, over, a, 41, 000, year, period, due, to, tidal, forces, resulting, from, the, orbit, of, the, moon, consequently, the, antarctic, circle, is, currently, drifting, southwards, at, a, speed, of, about, 14, 5, m, 48, ft, per, year, the, antarctic, circle, is, the, northernmost, latitude, in, the, southern, hemisphere, at, which, the, centre, of, the, sun, can, remain, continuously, above, the, horizon, for, twenty, four, hours, as, a, result, at, least, once, each, year, at, any, location, within, the, antarctic, circle, the, centre, of, the, sun, is, visible, at, local, midnight, and, at, least, once, the, centre, of, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, at, local, noon, directly, on, the, antarctic, circle, these, events, occur, in, principle, exactly, once, per, year, at, the, december, and, june, solstices, respectively, however, because, of, atmospheric, refraction, and, mirages, and, because, the, sun, appears, as, a, disk, and, not, a, point, part, of, the, midnight, sun, may, be, seen, on, the, night, of, the, southern, summer, solstice, up, to, about, 50, minutes, 90, km, 56, mi, north, of, the, antarctic, circle, similarly, on, the, day, of, the, southern, winter, solstice, part, of, the, sun, may, be, seen, up, to, about, 50, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, that, is, true, at, sea, level, those, limits, increase, with, elevation, above, sea, level, although, in, mountainous, regions, there, is, often, no, direct, view, of, the, true, horizon, mirages, on, the, antarctic, continent, tend, to, be, even, more, spectacular, than, in, arctic, regions, creating, for, example, a, series, of, apparent, sunsets, and, sunrises, while, in, reality, the, sun, remains, below, the, horizon, there, is, no, permanent, human, population, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, but, there, are, several, research, stations, in, antarctica, operated, by, various, nations, that, are, inhabited, by, teams, of, scientists, who, rotate, on, a, seasonal, basis, in, previous, centuries, some, semi, permanent, whaling, stations, were, established, on, the, continent, and, some, whalers, would, live, there, for, a, year, or, more, at, least, eleven, children, have, been, born, in, antarctica, albeit, in, stations, north, of, the, antarctic, circle, download, coordinates, as, the, circumference, of, the, antarctic, circle, is, roughly, 16, 000, kilometres, 9, 900, mi, the, area, south, of, the, circle, is, about, 20, 000, 000, km, 2, 7, 700, 000, sq, mi, and, covers, roughly, 4, of, earth, s, surface, most, of, the, continent, of, antarctica, is, within, the, antarctic, circle, starting, at, the, prime, meridian, and, heading, eastwards, the, antarctic, circle, passes, through, 66, 33, 50, s, 0, 0, 0, w, 66, 56389, s, 0, 00000, e, 66, 56389, 0, 00000, prime, meridian
