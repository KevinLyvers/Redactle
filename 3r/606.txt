vanuatu, english, v, n, u, t, u, vah, noo, ah, too, or, v, n, w, t, u, van, wah, too, bislama, and, french, pronunciation, officially, the, republic, of, vanuatu, french, r, publique, de, vanuatu, bislama, ripablik, blong, vanuatu, is, an, island, country, in, melanesia, located, in, the, south, pacific, ocean, the, archipelago, which, is, of, volcanic, origin, is, 1, 750, km, 1, 090, mi, east, of, northern, australia, 540, km, 340, mi, northeast, of, new, caledonia, east, of, new, guinea, southeast, of, solomon, islands, and, west, of, fiji, vanuatu, was, first, inhabited, by, melanesian, people, the, first, europeans, to, visit, the, islands, were, a, spanish, expedition, led, by, portuguese, navigator, fernandes, de, queir, s, who, arrived, on, the, largest, island, esp, ritu, santo, in, 1606, queir, s, claimed, the, archipelago, for, spain, as, part, of, the, colonial, spanish, east, indies, and, named, it, la, austrialia, del, esp, ritu, santo, in, the, 1880s, france, and, the, united, kingdom, claimed, parts, of, the, archipelago, and, in, 1906, they, agreed, on, a, framework, for, jointly, managing, the, archipelago, as, the, new, hebrides, through, an, anglo, french, condominium, an, independence, movement, arose, in, the, 1970s, and, the, republic, of, vanuatu, was, founded, in, 1980, since, independence, the, country, has, become, a, member, of, the, united, nations, commonwealth, of, nations, organisation, internationale, de, la, francophonie, and, the, pacific, islands, forum, vanuatu, s, name, derives, from, the, word, vanua, land, or, home, which, occurs, in, several, austronesian, languages, combined, with, the, word, tu, meaning, to, stand, from, poc, tuqur, together, the, two, words, convey, the, independent, status, of, the, country, the, history, of, vanuatu, before, european, colonisation, is, mostly, obscure, because, of, the, lack, of, written, sources, up, to, that, point, and, because, only, limited, archaeological, work, has, been, conducted, vanuatu, s, volatile, geology, and, climate, is, also, likely, to, have, destroyed, or, hidden, many, prehistoric, sites, archaeological, evidence, gathered, since, the, 1980s, supports, the, theory, that, the, vanuatuan, islands, were, first, settled, about, 3, 000, years, ago, in, the, period, roughly, between, 1100, bce, and, 700, bce, these, were, almost, certainly, people, of, the, lapita, culture, the, formerly, widespread, idea, that, vanuatu, might, have, been, only, marginally, affected, by, this, culture, was, rendered, obsolete, by, the, evidence, uncovered, in, recent, decades, at, numerous, sites, on, most, of, the, islands, in, the, archipelago, ranging, from, the, banks, islands, in, the, north, to, aneityum, in, the, south, notable, lapita, sites, include, teouma, on, fat, uripiv, and, vao, off, the, coast, of, malakula, and, makue, on, aore, several, ancient, burial, sites, have, been, excavated, most, notably, teouma, on, fat, which, has, a, large, ancient, cemetery, containing, the, remains, of, 94, individuals, there, are, also, sites, on, fat, and, on, the, adjacent, islands, of, lelepa, and, eretoka, associated, with, the, 16th, 17th, century, chief, or, chiefs, called, roy, mata, this, may, be, a, title, held, by, different, men, over, several, generations, roy, mata, is, said, to, have, united, local, clans, and, instituted, and, presided, over, an, era, of, peace, the, stories, about, roy, mata, come, from, local, oral, tradition, and, are, consistent, with, centuries, old, evidence, uncovered, at, archaeological, sites, the, lapita, sites, became, vanuatu, s, first, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2008, the, immediate, origins, of, the, lapita, lie, to, the, northwest, in, the, solomon, islands, archipelago, and, the, bismarck, archipelago, of, papua, new, guinea, though, dna, studies, of, a, 3, 000, year, old, skeleton, found, near, port, vila, in, 2016, indicates, that, some, may, have, arrived, directly, from, the, philippines, and, or, taiwan, pausing, only, briefly, en, route, they, brought, with, them, crops, such, as, yam, taro, and, banana, as, well, as, domesticated, animals, such, as, pigs, and, chickens, their, arrival, is, coincident, with, the, extinction, of, several, species, such, as, the, land, crocodile, mekosuchus, kalpokasi, land, tortoise, meiolania, damelipi, and, various, flightless, bird, species, lapita, settlements, reached, as, far, east, as, tonga, and, samoa, at, their, greatest, extent, over, time, the, lapita, culture, lost, much, of, its, early, unity, as, such, it, became, increasingly, fragmented, the, precise, reasons, for, which, are, unclear, over, the, centuries, pottery, settlement, and, burial, practices, in, vanuatu, all, evolved, in, a, more, localised, direction, with, long, distance, trade, and, migration, patterns, contracting, nevertheless, some, limited, long, distance, trade, did, continue, with, similar, cultural, practices, and, late, period, items, also, being, found, in, fiji, new, caledonia, the, bismarcks, and, the, solomons, finds, in, central, and, southern, vanuatu, such, as, distinctive, adzes, also, indicate, some, trade, connections, with, and, possibly, population, movements, of, polynesian, peoples, to, the, east, over, time, it, is, thought, that, the, lapita, either, mixed, with, or, acted, as, pioneers, for, migrants, coming, from, the, bismarks, and, elsewhere, in, melanesia, ultimately, producing, the, darker, skinned, physiognomy, that, is, typical, of, modern, ni, vanuatu, linguistically, the, lapita, peoples, austronesian, languages, were, maintained, with, all, of, the, numerous, 100, autochthonous, languages, of, vanuatu, being, classified, as, belonging, to, the, oceanic, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, this, linguistic, hyperdiversity, resulted, from, a, number, of, factors, continuing, waves, of, migration, the, existence, of, numerous, decentralised, and, generally, self, sufficient, communities, hostilities, between, people, groups, with, none, able, to, dominate, any, of, the, others, and, the, difficult, geography, of, vanuatu, that, impeded, inter, and, intra, island, travel, and, communication, the, geological, record, also, shows, that, a, huge, volcanic, eruption, occurred, on, ambrym, in, c, 200, ce, which, would, have, devastated, local, populations, and, likely, resulted, in, further, population, movements, the, vanuatu, islands, first, had, contact, with, europeans, in, april, 1606, when, the, portuguese, explorer, pedro, fernandes, de, queir, s, sailing, for, the, spanish, crown, departed, el, callao, sailed, by, the, banks, islands, landing, briefly, on, gaua, which, he, called, santa, mar, a, continuing, further, south, queir, s, arrived, at, the, largest, island, naming, it, la, austrialia, del, esp, ritu, santo, or, the, southern, land, of, the, holy, spirit, believing, he, had, arrived, in, terra, australis, australia, the, spanish, established, a, short, lived, settlement, named, nueva, jerusalem, at, big, bay, on, the, north, side, of, the, island, despite, queir, s, s, intention, relations, with, the, ni, vanuatu, turned, violent, within, days, the, spanish, subsequent, attempts, to, make, contact, were, met, with, the, islanders, fleeing, or, leading, the, explorers, into, an, ambush, many, of, the, crew, including, queir, s, were, also, suffering, from, ill, health, with, queir, s, s, mental, state, also, deteriorating, the, settlement, was, abandoned, after, a, month, with, queir, s, continuing, his, search, for, the, southern, continent, europeans, did, not, return, until, 1768, when, the, french, explorer, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, sailed, by, the, islands, on, 22, may, naming, them, the, great, cyclades, of, the, various, french, toponyms, bougainville, devised, only, pentecost, island, has, stuck, the, french, landed, on, ambae, trading, with, the, native, people, in, a, peaceful, manner, though, bougainville, stated, that, they, were, later, attacked, necessitating, him, to, fire, warning, shots, with, his, muskets, before, his, crew, left, and, continued, their, voyage, in, july, september, 1774, the, islands, were, explored, extensively, by, british, explorer, captain, james, cook, who, named, them, the, new, hebrides, after, the, hebrides, off, the, west, coast, of, scotland, a, name, that, lasted, until, independence, in, 1980, cook, managed, to, maintain, generally, cordial, relations, with, the, ni, vanuatu, by, giving, them, presents, and, refraining, from, violence, in, 1789, william, bligh, and, the, remainder, of, his, crew, sailed, through, the, banks, islands, on, their, return, voyage, to, timor, following, the, mutiny, on, the, bounty, bligh, later, returned, to, the, islands, naming, them, after, his, benefactor, joseph, banks, whaleships, were, among, the, first, regular, visitors, to, this, group, of, islands, the, first, recorded, visit, was, by, the, rose, in, february, 1804, and, the, last, known, visit, by, the, new, bedford, ship, john, and, winthrop, in, 1887, in, 1825, the, trader, peter, dillon, s, discovery, of, sandalwood, on, the, island, of, erromango, highly, valued, as, an, incense, in, china, where, it, could, be, traded, for, tea, resulted, in, rush, of, incomers, that, ended, in, 1830, after, a, clash, between, immigrant, polynesian, workers, and, indigenous, ni, vanuatu, further, sandalwood, trees, were, found, on, efate, espiritu, santo, and, aneityum, prompting, a, series, of, boom, and, busts, though, supplies, were, essentially, exhausted, by, the, mid, 1860s, and, the, trade, largely, ceased, during, the, 1860s, planters, in, australia, fiji, new, caledonia, and, the, samoan, islands, in, need, of, labourers, encouraged, a, long, term, indentured, labour, trade, called, blackbirding, at, the, height, of, the, labour, trade, more, than, one, half, the, adult, male, population, of, several, of, the, islands, worked, abroad, because, of, this, and, the, poor, conditions, and, abuse, often, faced, by, workers, as, well, the, introduction, of, common, diseases, to, which, native, ni, vanuatu, had, no, immunity, the, population, of, vanuatu, declined, severely, with, the, current, population, being, greatly, reduced, compared, to, pre, contact, times, greater, oversight, of, the, trade, saw, it, gradually, wind, down, with, australia, barring, any, further, blackbird, labourers, in, 1906, followed, by, fiji, and, samoa, in, 1910, and, 1913, respectively, from, 1839, onwards, missionaries, both, roman, catholic, and, protestant, arrived, on, the, islands, at, first, they, faced, hostility, most, notably, with, the, killings, of, john, williams, and, james, harris, of, the, london, missionary, society, on, erromango, in, 1839, despite, this, they, pressed, on, resulting, in, many, conversions, to, the, consternation, of, the, europeans, ni, vanuatu, syncretised, christianity, with, traditional, kastom, beliefs, the, anglican, melanesian, mission, also, took, young, converts, for, further, training, in, new, zealand, and, norfolk, island, presbyterian, missionaries, are, particularly, successful, on, aneityum, though, less, so, on, tanna, with, missionaries, being, repeatedly, chased, off, the, island, by, locals, throughout, the, 1840s, 60s, the, waves, of, illnesses, and, deaths, the, missionaries, brought, with, them, may, have, been, partly, to, blame, for, the, hostile, response, other, european, settlers, also, came, looking, for, land, for, cotton, plantations, the, first, of, these, being, henry, ross, lewin, on, tanna, in, 1865, which, he, later, abandoned, when, international, cotton, prices, collapsed, after, the, ending, of, the, american, civil, war, they, switched, to, coffee, cocoa, bananas, and, most, successfully, coconuts, initially, british, subjects, from, australia, made, up, the, majority, of, settlers, but, with, little, support, from, the, british, government, they, frequently, struggled, to, make, a, success, of, their, settlements, french, planters, also, began, arriving, beginning, with, ferdinand, chevillard, on, efate, in, 1880, and, later, in, larger, numbers, following, the, creation, of, the, compagnie, caledonienne, des, nouvelles, h, brides, ccnh, i, 1882, by, john, higginson, a, fiercely, pro, french, irishman, which, soon, tipped, the, balance, in, favour, of, french, subjects, the, french, government, took, over, the, ccnh, in, 1894, and, actively, encouraged, french, settlement, by, 1906, french, settlers, at, 401, outnumbered, the, british, 228, almost, two, to, one, the, jumbling, of, french, and, british, interests, in, the, islands, and, the, near, lawlessness, prevalent, there, brought, petitions, for, one, or, both, of, the, two, powers, to, annex, the, territory, the, convention, of, 16, october, 1887, established, a, joint, naval, commission, for, the, sole, purpose, of, protecting, french, and, british, citizens, with, no, claim, to, jurisdiction, over, internal, native, affairs, hostilities, between, settlers, and, ni, vanuatu, were, commonplace, often, centring, on, disputes, over, land, which, had, been, purchased, in, dubious, circumstances, there, was, pressure, from, french, settlers, in, new, caledonia, to, annex, the, islands, though, britain, was, unwilling, to, relinquish, their, influence, completely, as, a, result, in, 1906, france, and, the, united, kingdom, agreed, to, administer, the, islands, jointly, called, the, anglo, french, condominium, it, was, a, unique, form, of, government, with, two, separate, governmental, legal, judicial, and, financial, systems, that, came, together, only, in, a, joint, court, land, expropriation, and, exploitation, of, ni, vanuatu, workers, on, plantations, continued, apace, in, an, effort, to, curb, the, worst, of, the, abuses, and, with, the, support, of, the, missionaries, the, condominium, s, authority, was, extended, via, the, anglo, french, protocol, of, 1914, although, this, was, not, formally, ratified, until, 1922, while, this, resulted, in, some, improvements, labour, abuses, continued, and, ni, vanuatu, were, barred, from, acquiring, the, citizenship, of, either, power, being, officially, stateless, the, underfunded, condominium, government, proved, dysfunctional, with, the, duplication, of, administrations, making, effective, governance, difficult, and, time, consuming, education, healthcare, and, other, such, services, were, left, in, the, hands, of, the, missionaries, during, the, 1920s, 1930s, indentured, workers, from, vietnam, then, part, of, french, indochina, came, to, work, in, the, plantations, in, the, new, hebrides, by, 1929, there, were, some, 6, 000, vietnamese, people, in, the, new, hebrides, there, was, some, social, and, political, unrest, among, them, in, the, 1940s, due, to, the, poor, working, conditions, and, the, social, effects, of, allied, troops, who, were, generally, more, sympathetic, to, their, plight, than, the, planters, most, vietnamese, were, repatriated, in, 1946, and, 1963, though, a, small, vietnamese, community, remains, in, vanuatu, today, the, second, world, war, brought, immense, change, to, the, archipelago, the, fall, of, france, to, nazi, germany, in, 1940, allowed, britain, to, gain, a, greater, level, of, authority, on, the, islands, the, australian, military, stationed, a, 2, 000, strong, force, on, malakula, in, a, bid, to, protect, australia, from, a, possible, japanese, invasion, following, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, on, 7, december, 1941, the, united, states, joined, the, war, on, the, allied, side, japan, soon, advanced, rapidly, throughout, melanesia, and, was, in, possession, of, much, of, what, is, now, papua, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, by, april, 1942, leaving, the, new, hebrides, on, the, frontline, of, any, further, advance, to, forestall, this, from, may, 1942, us, troops, were, stationed, on, the, islands, where, they, built, airstrips, roads, military, bases, and, an, array, of, other, supporting, infrastructure, on, efate, and, espiritu, santo, at, the, peak, of, the, deployment, some, 50, 000, americans, were, stationed, on, the, two, military, bases, outnumbering, the, native, population, of, roughly, 40, 000, with, thousands, more, allied, troops, passing, through, the, islands, at, some, point, a, small, ni, vanuatu, force, of, some, 200, men, the, new, hebrides, defence, force, was, established, to, support, the, americans, and, thousands, more, were, engaged, in, the, construction, and, maintenance, work, as, part, of, the, vanuatu, labor, corps, the, american, presence, effectively, sidelined, the, anglo, french, authorities, for, the, duration, of, their, stay, with, the, americans, more, tolerant, and, friendly, attitude, to, the, ni, vanuatu, informal, habits, relative, wealth, and, the, presence, of, african, american, troops, serving, with, a, degree, of, equality, albeit, in, a, segregated, force, seriously, undermining, the, underlying, ethos, of, colonial, superiority, wartime, vanuatu, was, the, setting, for, james, michener, s, novel, tales, of, the, south, pacific, with, the, successful, reoccupation, of, the, solomons, in, 1943, the, new, hebrides, lost, their, strategic, importance, and, the, americans, withdrew, in, 1945, selling, much, of, their, equipment, at, bargain, prices, and, dumping, the, rest, in, the, sea, at, a, place, now, called, million, dollar, point, on, espiritu, santo, the, rapid, american, deployment, and, withdrawal, led, to, growth, in, cargo, cults, most, notably, that, of, john, frum, whereby, ni, vanuatu, hoped, that, by, returning, to, traditional, values, whilst, mimicking, aspects, of, the, american, presence, that, cargo, i, e, large, quantities, of, american, goods, would, be, delivered, to, them, meanwhile, the, condominium, government, returned, though, understaffed, and, underfunded, it, struggled, to, reassert, its, authority, decolonisation, began, sweeping, the, european, empires, after, the, war, and, from, the, 1950s, the, condominium, government, began, a, somewhat, belated, campaign, of, modernisation, and, economic, development, hospitals, were, built, doctors, trained, and, immunisation, campaigns, carried, out, the, inadequate, mission, run, school, system, was, taken, over, and, improved, with, primary, enrollment, greatly, increasing, to, be, near, universal, by, 1970, there, was, greater, oversight, of, the, plantations, with, worker, exploitation, being, clamped, down, on, and, ni, vanuatu, paid, higher, wages, new, industries, such, as, cattle, ranching, commercial, fishing, and, manganese, mining, were, established, ni, vanuatu, began, gradually, to, take, over, more, positions, of, power, and, influence, within, the, economy, and, the, church, despite, this, the, british, and, french, still, dominated, the, politics, of, the, colony, with, an, advisory, council, set, up, in, 1957, containing, some, ni, vanuatu, representation, having, little, power, the, economic, development, had, unintended, consequences, in, the, 1960s, many, planters, began, fencing, off, and, clearing, large, areas, of, bushland, for, cattle, ranching, which, were, often, deemed, to, be, communally, held, kastom, lands, by, ni, vanuatu, on, espiritu, santo, the, nagriamel, movement, was, founded, in, 1966, by, chief, buluk, and, jimmy, stevens, on, a, platform, of, opposing, any, further, land, clearances, and, gradual, ni, vanuatu, led, economic, development, the, movement, gained, a, large, following, prompting, a, crackdown, by, the, authorities, with, buluk, and, stevens, being, arrested, in, 1967, upon, their, release, they, began, to, press, for, complete, independence, in, 1971, father, walter, lini, established, another, party, the, new, hebrides, cultural, association, later, renamed, the, new, hebrides, national, party, nhnp, which, also, focused, on, achieving, independence, and, opposition, to, land, expropriation, the, nndp, first, came, to, prominence, in, 1971, when, the, condominium, government, was, forced, to, intervene, after, a, rash, of, land, speculation, by, foreign, nationals, meanwhile, french, settlers, and, francophone, and, mixed, race, ni, vanuatu, established, two, separate, parties, on, a, platform, of, more, gradual, political, development, the, mouvement, autonomiste, des, nouvelles, h, brides, manh, based, on, espiritu, santo, and, the, union, des, communaut, s, des, nouvelles, h, brides, ucnh, on, efate, the, parties, aligned, on, linguistic, and, religious, lines, the, nhnp, was, seen, as, the, party, of, anglophone, protestants, and, were, backed, by, the, british, who, wished, to, exit, the, colony, altogether, whereas, the, manh, ucnh, nagriamel, and, others, collectively, known, as, the, moderates, represented, catholic, francophone, interests, and, a, more, gradual, path, to, independence, france, backed, these, groups, as, they, were, keen, to, maintain, their, influence, in, the, region, most, especially, in, their, mineral, rich, colony, of, new, caledonia, where, they, were, attempting, to, suppress, an, independence, movement, meanwhile, economic, development, continued, with, numerous, banks, and, financial, centres, opening, up, in, the, early, 1970s, to, take, advantage, of, the, territory, s, tax, haven, status, a, mini, building, boom, took, off, in, port, vila, and, following, the, building, of, a, deep, sea, wharf, cruise, ship, tourism, grew, rapidly, with, annual, arrivals, reaching, 40, 000, by, 1977, the, boom, encouraged, increasing, urbanisation, and, the, populations, of, port, vila, and, luganville, grew, rapidly, in, november, 1974, the, british, and, french, met, and, agreed, to, create, new, hebrides, representative, assembly, in, the, colony, based, partly, on, universal, suffrage, and, partly, on, appointed, persons, representing, various, interest, groups, the, first, election, took, place, in, november, 1975, resulting, in, an, overall, victory, for, the, nhnp, the, moderates, disputed, the, results, with, jimmy, stevens, threatening, to, secede, and, declare, independence, the, condominium, s, resident, commissioners, decided, to, postpone, the, opening, of, the, assembly, though, the, two, sides, proved, unable, to, agree, on, a, solution, prompting, protests, and, counter, protests, some, of, which, turned, violent, after, discussions, and, some, fresh, elections, in, disputed, areas, the, assembly, finally, convened, in, november, 1976, the, nhnp, renamed, itself, the, vanua, aku, pati, vp, in, 1977, and, now, supported, immediate, independence, under, a, strong, central, government, and, an, anglicisation, of, the, islands, the, moderates, meanwhile, supported, a, more, gradual, transition, to, independence, and, a, federal, system, plus, the, maintenance, of, french, as, an, official, language, in, march, 1977, a, joint, anglo, french, and, ni, vanuatu, conference, was, held, in, london, at, which, it, was, agreed, to, hold, fresh, assembly, elections, and, later, an, independence, referendum, in, 1980, the, vp, boycotted, the, conference, and, the, subsequent, election, in, november, they, set, up, a, parallel, people, s, provisional, government, which, had, de, facto, control, of, many, areas, prompting, violent, confrontations, with, moderates, and, the, condominium, government, a, compromise, was, eventually, brokered, a, government, of, national, unity, formed, under, a, new, constitution, and, fresh, elections, held, in, november, 1979, which, the, vp, won, with, a, comfortable, majority, independence, was, now, scheduled, for, 30, july, 1980, performing, less, well, than, expected, the, moderates, disputed, the, results, tensions, continued, throughout, 1980, violent, confrontations, occurred, between, vp, and, moderate, supporters, on, several, islands, on, espiritu, santo, nagriamel, and, moderate, activists, under, jimmy, stevens, funded, by, the, american, libertarian, organisation, phoenix, foundation, took, over, the, island, s, government, in, january, and, declared, the, independent, republic, of, vemarana, prompting, vp, supporters, to, flee, and, the, central, government, to, institute, a, blockade, in, may, an, abortive, moderate, rebellion, broke, out, on, tanna, in, the, course, of, which, one, of, their, leaders, was, shot, and, killed, the, british, and, french, sent, in, troops, in, july, in, a, bid, to, forestall, the, vemarana, secessionists, still, ambivalent, about, independence, the, french, effectively, neutered, the, force, prompting, a, collapse, of, law, and, order, on, espiritu, santo, resulting, in, large, scale, looting, the, new, hebrides, now, renamed, vanuatu, achieved, independence, as, planned, on, 30, july, 1980, under, prime, minister, walter, lini, with, a, ceremonial, president, replacing, the, resident, commissioners, the, anglo, french, forces, withdrew, in, august, and, lini, called, in, troops, from, papua, new, guinea, sparking, the, brief, coconut, war, against, jimmy, stevens, s, vemarana, separatists, the, png, forces, quickly, quelled, the, vemarana, revolt, and, stevens, surrendered, on, 1, september, he, was, later, jailed, lini, remained, in, office, until, 1991, running,
