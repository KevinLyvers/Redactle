indonesia, tectonically, they, are, located, on, the, halmahera, plate, within, the, molucca, sea, collision, zone, geographically, they, are, located, east, of, sulawesi, west, of, new, guinea, and, north, and, east, of, timor, lying, within, wallacea, mostly, east, of, the, biogeographical, weber, line, the, moluccas, have, been, considered, a, geographical, and, cultural, intersection, of, asia, and, oceania, the, islands, were, known, as, the, spice, islands, because, of, the, nutmeg, mace, and, cloves, that, were, exclusively, found, there, the, presence, of, which, sparked, european, colonial, interests, in, the, 16th, century, the, maluku, islands, formed, a, single, province, from, indonesian, independence, until, 1999, when, they, were, split, into, two, provinces, a, new, province, north, maluku, incorporates, the, area, between, morotai, and, sula, with, the, arc, of, islands, from, buru, and, seram, to, wetar, remaining, within, the, existing, maluku, province, north, maluku, is, predominantly, muslim, and, its, capital, is, sofifi, on, halmahera, island, maluku, province, has, a, larger, christian, population, and, its, capital, is, ambon, though, originally, melanesian, many, island, populations, especially, in, the, banda, islands, were, massacred, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, dutch, portuguese, war, also, known, as, the, spice, war, a, second, influx, of, immigrants, primarily, from, java, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, under, the, dutch, and, continues, in, the, indonesian, era, which, has, also, caused, a, lot, of, controversy, as, the, transmigrant, programs, are, thought, to, be, a, contributing, factor, to, the, maluku, riots, the, etymology, of, the, word, maluku, is, unclear, and, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, for, many, experts, the, first, recorded, word, that, can, be, identified, with, maluku, comes, from, nagarakretagama, an, old, javanese, eulogy, of, 1365, canto, 14, stanza, 5, mentioned, maloko, which, pigeaud, identified, with, ternate, or, moluccas, 17, 34, a, theory, holds, that, maluku, comes, from, the, phrase, moloko, kie, raha, or, moloku, kie, raha, in, the, ternate, language, raha, means, four, while, kie, here, means, mountain, kie, raha, or, four, mountains, refers, to, ternate, tidore, bacan, and, jailolo, the, name, jailolo, has, been, used, in, the, past, to, refer, to, halmahera, island, all, of, which, have, their, kolano, a, local, title, for, kings, rooted, in, panji, tales, it, is, unclear, what, the, meaning, of, moloko, or, moloku, is, one, possible, meaning, is, in, ternate, language, it, meant, to, hold, or, grasp, in, which, case, moloko, kie, raha, could, be, understood, to, mean, confederation, of, the, four, mountains, another, possibility, is, that, the, word, originates, from, the, word, maloko, which, is, a, combination, of, the, particle, ma, and, the, root, loko, in, north, halmahera, languages, means, the, variety, of, words, relating, to, the, location, of, mountains, in, which, case, maloko, kie, raha, in, the, phrase, ternate, se, tidore, moti, se, mara, maloko, kie, raha, means, ternate, tidore, moti, and, mara, the, place, of, the, four, mountains, or, with, the, shifting, of, pronunciation, of, loko, towards, luku, means, ternate, tidore, moti, and, mara, the, world, of, the, four, mountains, australo, melanesians, were, the, first, people, to, inhabit, the, islands, at, least, 40, 000, years, ago, and, then, a, later, migration, of, austronesian, speakers, around, 2000, bc, other, archaeological, finds, showed, possible, arab, merchants, began, to, arrive, in, the, fourteenth, century, bringing, islam, the, conversion, to, islam, occurred, in, many, islands, especially, in, the, centres, of, trade, while, aboriginal, animism, persisted, in, the, hinterlands, and, more, isolated, islands, archaeological, evidence, here, relies, largely, on, the, occurrence, of, pigs, teeth, as, evidence, of, pork, eating, or, abstinence, therefrom, remnants, of, majapahit, expeditions, were, also, found, in, oral, as, well, as, archaeological, sites, a, story, from, letvuan, on, kai, kecil, island, tells, of, a, balinese, envoy, of, gajah, mada, by, the, name, of, kasdev, his, wife, dit, ratngil, and, eight, of, their, children, archaeological, sites, of, ancient, tombs, found, in, sorbay, bay, south, of, letvuan, seemed, to, support, the, story, as, well, as, some, cultural, practices, of, kei, of, balinese, origin, other, archaeological, finds, in, kei, islands, include, shiva, statue, from, kei, besar, island, another, oral, story, was, of, 14th, century, majapahit, expedition, to, negeri, ema, ambon, island, by, an, envoy, named, nyi, mas, kenang, eko, sutarmi, alongside, 22, of, her, retinues, and, a, spear, bearer, trying, to, form, an, alliance, and, trading, relationship, with, negeri, ema, s, leader, by, the, name, of, kapitan, ading, adang, anaan, tanahatuila, the, meeting, was, facilitated, by, malessy, soa, lisa, maitimu, however, it, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, as, sutarmi, failed, she, decided, to, stay, in, exile, while, her, retinues, settled, and, married, locals, of, ema, and, her, spear, bearer, settled, on, the, coast, but, was, killed, later, by, gunung, maut, troops, archaeological, finds, relating, to, this, expedition, include, a, water, source, with, sun, symbols, with, nine, rays, and, heirlooms, of, spears, and, totobuang, kept, by, the, maitimu, family, and, village, office, of, negeri, ema, alongside, many, potteries, in, august, 1511, the, portuguese, conquered, the, city, state, of, malacca, the, most, significant, lasting, effects, of, the, portuguese, presence, were, the, disruption, and, reorganization, of, the, southeast, asian, trade, and, in, eastern, indonesia, including, maluku, the, introduction, of, christianity, one, portuguese, diary, noted, it, is, over, thirty, years, since, they, became, moors,

local, ruler, who, was, impressed, with, his, martial, skills, the, rulers, of, the, competing, island, states, of, ternate, and, tidore, also, sought, portuguese, assistance, and, the, newcomers, were, welcomed, in, the, area, as, buyers, of, supplies, and, spices, during, a, lull, in, the, regional, trade, due, to, the, temporary, disruption, of, javanese, and, malay, sailings, to, the, area, following, the, 1511, conflict, in, malacca, the, spice, trade, soon, revived, but, the, portuguese, would, not, be, able, to, fully, monopolize, or, disrupt, this, trade, allying, himself, with, ternate, s, ruler, serr, o, constructed, a, fortress, on, that, tiny, island, and, served, as, the, head, of, a, mercenary, band, of, portuguese, seamen, under, the, service, of, one, of, the, two, local, feuding, sultans, who, controlled, most, of, the, spice, trade, both, serr, o, and, ferdinand, magellan, however, perished, before, they, could, meet, one, another, the, portuguese, first, landed, in, ambon, in, 1513, but, it, only, became, the, new, centre, for, their, activities, in, maluku, following, the, expulsion, from, ternate, european, power, in, the, region, was, weak, and, ternate, became, an, expanding, fiercely, islamic, and, anti, european, state, the, portuguese, ternate, wars, raged, throughout, the, reigns, of, sultan, baab, ullah, r, 1570, 1583, and, his, son, sultan, saidi, berkat, r, 1583, 1606, following, portuguese, missionary, work, there, have, been, large, christian, communities, in, eastern, indonesia, through, to, contemporary, times, which, has, contributed, to, a, sense, of, shared, interest, with, europeans, particularly, among, the, ambonese, the, dutch, arrived, in, 1599, and, competed, with, the, portuguese, in, the, area, for, trade, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, the, course, of, dutch, portuguese, war, allied, with, the, sultan, of, ternate, and, conquered, ambon, and, tidore, in, 1605, expelling, the, portuguese, a, spanish, counterattack, from, the, philippines, restored, iberian, rule, in, parts, of, north, maluku, up, to, 1663, however, the, dutch, monopolized, the, production, and, trade, of, spices, through, a, ruthless, policy, this, included, the, genocidal, conquest, of, the, nutmeg, producing, banda, islands, in, 1621, the, elimination, of, the, english, in, ambon, in, 1623, and, the, subordination, of, ternate, and, tidore, in, the, 1650s, an, anticolonial, resistance, movement, led, by, a, tidore, prince, the, nuku, rebellion, engulfed, large, parts, of, maluku, and, papua, in, 1780, 1810, and, co, opted, the, british, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, again, in, the, napoleonic, wars, british, forces, captured, the, islands, in, 1796, 1801, and, 1810, respectively, and, held, them, until, 1817, in, that, time, they, uprooted, many, of, the, spice, trees, for, transplantation, throughout, the, british, empire, with, the, declaration, of, a, single, republic, of, indonesia, in, 1950, to, replace, the, federal, state, a, republic, of, south, maluku, republik, maluku, selatan, rms, was, declared, and, attempted, to, secede, led, by, chris, soumokil, former, supreme,

by, special, agreement, with, the, netherlands, the, moluccan, troops, were, ordered, to, move, to, the, netherlands, decades, later, descendants, of, these, moluccan, knil, soldiers, participated, in, the, 1975, dutch, train, hostage, crisis, the, 1977, dutch, train, hijacking, and, the, 1977, dutch, school, hostage, crisis, to, bring, attention, to, their, plight, for, an, independent, republic, of, south, maluku, maluku, is, one, of, the, first, provinces, of, indonesia, proclaimed, in, 1945, and, lasting, until, 1999, when, the, maluku, utara, and, halmahera, tengah, regencies, were, split, off, as, a, separate, province, of, north, maluku, its, capital, used, to, be, ternate, on, a, small, island, to, the, west, of, the, large, island, of, halmahera, but, has, been, moved, to, sofifi, on, halmahera, itself, the, capital, of, the, remaining, part, of, maluku, province, remains, at, ambon, religious, and, ethnic, conflict, erupted, across, the, islands, in, january, 1999, the, subsequent, 18, months, were, characterized, by, fighting, between, local, groups, of, muslims, and, christians, against, jihadist, groups, from, java, and, the, indonesian, military, backing, them, leading, to, the, destruction, of, thousands, of, houses, the, displacement, of, approximately, 500, 000, people, the, loss, of, thousands, of, lives, and, the, segregation, of, muslims, and, christians, the, maluku, islands, have, a, total, area, of, 850, 000, km, 2, 330, 000, sq, mi, 90, of, which, is, sea, there, are, an, estimated, 1027, islands, the, largest, two, islands, halmahera, and, seram, are, sparsely, populated, while, the, most, developed, ambon, and, ternate, are, small, the, majority, of, the, islands, are, forested, and, mountainous, the, tanimbar, islands, are, dry, and, hilly, while, the, aru, islands, are, flat, and, swampy, mount, binaiya, 3, 027, m, 9, 931, ft, on, seram, is, the, highest, mountain, several, islands, such, as, ternate, 1, 721, m, 5, 646, ft, and, the, tns, islands, are, volcanoes, emerging, from, the, sea, with, villages, sited, around, their, coasts, there, have, been, over, 70, serious, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, last, 500, years, and, earthquakes, are, common, the, geology, of, the, maluku, islands, shares, much, similar, history, characteristics, and, processes, with, the, neighbouring, nusa, tenggara, region, there, is, a, long, history, of, geological, study, of, these, regions, since, indonesian, colonial, times, however, the, geological, formation, and, progression, are, not, fully, understood, and, theories, of, the, island, s, geological, evolution, have, changed, extensively, in, recent, decades, the, maluku, islands, comprise, some, of, the, most, geologically, complex, and, active, regions, in, the, world, resulting, from, their, position, at, the, meeting, point, of, four, geological, plates, and, two, continental, blocks, biogeographically, all, of, the, islands, apart, from, the, aru, group, lie, in, wallacea, the, region, between, the, sunda, shelf, part, of, the, asia, block, and, the, arafura, shelf, part, of, the, australian, block, more, specifically, they, lie, between, weber, s, line, and, lydekker, s, line, and, thus, have, a, fauna, that, is, rather, more, australasian, than, asian, malukan, biodiversity, and, its, distribution, are, affected, by, various, tectonic, activities, most, of, the, islands, are, geologically, young, being, from, 1, million, to, 15, million, years, old, and, have, never, been, attached, to, the, larger, landmasses, the, maluku, islands, differ, from, other, areas, in, indonesia, they, contain, some, of, the, country, s, smallest, islands, coral, island, reefs, scattered, through, some, of, the, deepest, seas, in, the, world, and, no, large, islands, such, as, java, or, sumatra, flora, and, fauna, immigration, between, islands, is, thus, restricted, leading, to, a, high, rate, of, endemic, biota, evolving, the, ecology, of, the, maluku, islands, has, fascinated, naturalists, for, centuries, alfred, wallace, s, book, the, malay, archipelago, was, the, first, significant, study, of, the, area, s, natural, history, and, remains, an, important, resource, for, studying, indonesian, biodiversity, maluku, is, the, subject, of, two, major, historical, works, of, natural, history, by, georg, eberhard, rumphius, the, herbarium,

fauna, including, kangaroos, cassowaries, and, birds, of, paradise, while, many, ecological, problems, affect, both, small, islands, and, large, landmasses, small, islands, suffer, their, particular, problems, development, pressures, on, small, islands, are, increasing, although, their, effects, are, not, always, anticipated, although, indonesia, is, richly, endowed, with, natural, resources, the, resources, of, the, small, islands, of, maluku, are, limited, and, specialised, furthermore, human, resources, in, particular, are, limited, general, observations, about, small, islands, that, can, be, applied, to, the, maluku, islands, include, central, and, southern, maluku, islands, experience, the, dry, monsoon, between, october, and, march, and, the, wet, monsoon, from, may, to, august,

north, maluku, province, was, 1, 282, 937, hence, the, total, population, of, the, maluku, islands, as, a, region, in, 2020, was, 3, 131, 860, a, long, history, of, trade, and, seafaring, has, resulted, in, a, high, degree, of, mixed, ancestry, in, malukans, austronesian, peoples, added, to, the, native, melanesian, population, around, 2000, bce, melanesian, features, are, strongest, in,
