ancient, punjab, the, earliest, known, notable, local, king, of, this, region, was, known, as, king, porus, who, fought, the, famous, battle, of, the, hydaspes, against, alexander, the, great, his, kingdom, spanned, between, rivers, hydaspes, jhelum, and, acesines, chenab, strabo, had, held, the, territory, to, contain, almost, 300, cities, he, alongside, abisares, had, a, hostile, relationship, with, the, kingdom, of, taxila, which, was, ruled, by, his, extended, family, when, the, armies, of, alexander, crossed, the, indus, in, its, eastward, migration, probably, in, udabhandapura, he, was, greeted, by, the, ruler, of, taxila, omphis, omphis, had, hoped, to, force, both, porus, and, abisares, into, submission, leveraging, the, might, of, alexander, s, forces, and, diplomatic, missions, were, mounted, but, while, abisares, accepted, the, submission, porus, refused, this, led, alexander, to, seek, for, a, face, off, with, porus, thus, began, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, in, 326, bce, the, exact, site, remains, unknown, the, battle, is, thought, to, be, resulted, in, a, decisive, greek, victory, however, a, b, bosworth, warns, against, an, uncritical, reading, of, greek, sources, that, were, exaggerated, alexander, later, founded, two, cities, nicaea, at, the, site, of, victory, and, bucephalous, at, the, battle, ground, in, memory, of, his, horse, who, died, soon,

surrender, and, wandered, about, atop, an, elephant, until, he, was, wounded, and, his, force, routed, when, asked, by, alexander, how, he, wished, to, be, treated, porus, replied, treat, me, as, a, king, would, treat, another, king, despite, the, apparently, one, sided, results, alexander, was, impressed, by, porus, and, chose, to, not, depose, him, not, only, was, his, territory, reinstated, but, also, expanded, with, alexander, s, forces, annexing, the, territories, of, glausaes, who, ruled, to, the, northeast, of, porus, kingdom, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bce, perdiccas,

of, kautilya, had, established, his, empire, around, 320, bce, the, early, life, of, chandragupta, maurya, is, not, clear, kautilya, enrolled, the, young, chandragupta, in, the, university, at, taxila, to, educate, him, in, the, arts, sciences, logic, mathematics, warfare, and, administration, megasthenes, account, as, it, has, survived, in, greek, texts, that, quote, him, states, that, alexander, the, great, and, chandragupta, met, which, if, true, would, mean, his, rule, started, earlier, than, 321, bce, as, alexander, never, crossed, the, beas, river, so, his, territory, probably,

was, also, always, a, yaudheyan, warrior, according, to, the, bijaygadh, pillar, inscription, which, states, that, the, yaudheyas, elected, their, own, chief, who, also, served, as, the, general, for, the, mauryans, the, mauryan, military, was, also, made, up, vastly, of, men, from, the, punjab, janapadas, chandragupta, s, rule, was, very, well, organised, the, mauryans, had, an, autocratic, and, centralised, administration, system, aided, by, a, council, of, ministers, and, also, a, well, established, espionage, system, much, of, chandragupta, s, success, is, attributed, to, chanakya, the,
