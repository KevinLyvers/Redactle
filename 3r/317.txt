the, peninsula, have, well, developed, plains, while, the, eastern, and, northern, parts, are, mountainous, the, highest, mountain, in, korea, is, mount, paektu, 2, 744, m, through, which, runs, the, border, with, china, the, southern, extension, of, mount, paektu, is, a, highland, called, gaema, heights, this, highland, was, mainly, raised, during, the, cenozoic, orogeny, and, partly, covered, by, volcanic, matter, to, the, south, of, gaema, gowon, successive, high, mountains, are, located, along, the, eastern, coast, of, the, peninsula, this, mountain, range, is, named, baekdu, daegan,

other, countries, in, east, asia, due, to, the, peninsula, s, position, it, has, a, unique, climate, influenced, by, siberia, in, the, north, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, east, and, the, rest, of, eurasia, in, the, west, the, peninsula, has, four, distinct, seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, as, influence, from, siberia, weakens, temperatures, begin, to, increase, while, the, high, pressure, begins, to, move, away, if, the, weather, is, abnormally, dry, siberia, will, have, more, influence, on, the, peninsula, leading, to, wintry, weather, such, as, snow, during, june, at, the, start, of, the, summer, there, tends, to, be, a, lot, of, rain, due, to, the, cold, and, wet, air, from, the, sea, of, okhotsk, and, the, hot, and, humid, air, from, the, pacific, ocean, combining, when, these, fronts, combine, it, leads, to, a, so, called, rainy, season, with, often, cloudy, days, with, rain, which, is, sometimes, very, heavy, the, hot, and, humid, winds, from, the, south, west, blow, causing, an, increasing, amount, of, humidity, and, this, leads, to, the, fronts, moving, towards, manchuria, in, china, and, thus, there, is, less, rain, and, this, is, known, as, midsummer, temperatures, can, exceed, 30, c, 86, f, daily, at, this, time, of, year, usually, high, pressure, is, heavily, dominant, during, autumn, leading, to, clear, conditions, furthermore, temperatures, remain, high, but, the, humidity, becomes, relatively, low, the, weather, becomes, increasingly, dominated, by, siberia, during, winter, and, the, jet, stream, moves, further, south, causing, a, drop, in, temperature, this, season, is, relatively, dry, with, some, snow, falling, at, times, animal, life, of, the, korean, peninsula, includes, a, considerable, number, of, bird,

south, korea, became, extinct, during, the, japanese, colonial, era, period, it, has, been, confirmed, that, siberian, tigers, are, only, on, the, side, of, north, korea, now, there, are, also, approximately, 3, 034, species, of, vascular, plants, throughout, the, peninsula, one, of, the, best, known, artefacts, of, korea, s, history, of, science, and, technology, is, the, cheomseongdae, a, 9, 4, meter, high, astronomical, observatory, built, in, 634, the, earliest, known, surviving, korean, example, of, woodblock, printing, is, the, great, dharani, sutra, it, is, believed, to, have, been, printed, in, korea, in, 750, 51, which, if, correct, would, make, it, older, than, the, diamond, sutra, during, the, goryeo, dynasty, metal, movable, type, printing, was, invented, by, ch, oe, yun, i, in, 1234, this, invention, made, printing, easier, more, efficient, and, also, increased, literacy, which, observed, by, chinese, visitors, was, seen, to, be, so, important, where, it, was, considered, to, be, shameful, to, not, be, able, to, read, the, mongol, empire, later, adopted, korea, s, movable, type, printing, and, spread, as, far, as, central, asia, there, is, conjecture, as, to, whether, or, not, ch, oe, s, invention, had, any, influence, on, later, printing, inventions, such, as, gutenberg, s, printing, press, when, the, mongols, invaded, europe, they, inadvertently, introduced, different, kinds, of, asian, technology, during, the, joseon, period, the, turtle, ship, was, invented, which, were, covered, by, a, wooden, deck, and, iron, with, thorns, as, well, as, other, weapons, such, as, the, bigyeokjincheolloe, cannon, and, the, hwacha, the, korean, alphabet, hangul, was, also, invented, during, this, time, by, king, sejong, the, great, as, of, 2023, the,

the, koreans, who, speak, the, korean, language, the, number, of, foreigners, living, in, korea, has, also, steadily, increased, since, the, late, 20th, century, particularly, in, south, korea, where, more, than, 1, million, foreigners, reside, it, was, estimated, in, 2006, that, only, 26, 700, of, the, old, chinese, community, now, remain, in, south, korea, however, in, recent, years, immigration,

in, south, korea, while, religious, practice, has, been, suppressed, in, north, korea, throughout, korean, history, and, culture, regardless, of, separation, the, influence, of, traditional, beliefs, of, korean, shamanism, mahayana, buddhism, confucianism, and, taoism, have, remained, an, underlying, religion, of, the, korean, people, as, well, as, a, vital, aspect, of, their, culture, all, these,

oecd, average, although, south, korean, students, often, rank, high, on, international, comparative, assessments, the, education, system, is, criticised, for, emphasising, too, much, upon, passive, learning, and, memorisation, the, south, korean, education, system, is, rather, notably, strict, and, structured, as, compared, to, its, counterparts, in, most, western, societies, the, north, korean,
