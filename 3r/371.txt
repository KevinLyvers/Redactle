the, drakensberg, zulu, ukhahlamba, sotho, maloti, afrikaans, drakensberge, is, the, eastern, portion, of, the, great, escarpment, which, encloses, the, central, southern, african, plateau, the, great, escarpment, reaches, its, greatest, elevation, 2, 000, to, 3, 482, metres, 6, 562, to, 11, 424, feet, within, the, border, region, of, south, africa, and, lesotho, the, drakensberg, escarpment, stretches, for, more, than, 1, 000, kilometres, 600, miles, from, the, eastern, cape, province, in, the, south, then, successively, forms, in, order, from, south, to, north, the, border, between, lesotho, and, the, eastern, cape, and, the, border, between, lesotho, and, kwazulu, natal, province, thereafter, it, forms, the, border, between, kwazulu, natal, and, the, free, state, and, next, as, the, border, between, kwazulu, natal, and, mpumalanga, province, the, escarpment, winds, north, from, there, through, mpumalanga, where, it, includes, features, such, as, the, blyde, river, canyon, three, rondavels, and, god, s, window, it, then, extends, farther, north, to, hoedspruit, in, southeastern, limpopo, where, it, is, known, as, klein, drakensberg, by, the, afrikaner, from, hoedspruit, it, extends, west, to, tzaneen, also, in, limpopo, province, where, it, is, known, as, the, wolkberg, mountains, and, iron, crown, mountain, at, 2, 200, m, 7, 200, ft, above, sea, level, the, wolkberg, is, the, highest, elevation, in, limpopo, the, escarpment, extends, west, again, and, at, mokopane, it, is, known, as, the, strydpoort, mountains, the, afrikaans, name, drakensberge, comes, from, the, name, the, earliest, dutch, settlers, gave, to, the, escarpment, namely, drakensbergen, or, dragons, mountains, the, highest, portion, of, the, great, escarpment, is, known, in, zulu, as, ukhahlamba, and, as, maloti, in, sotho, barrier, of, up, pointed, spears, the, great, escarpment, is, composed, of, steep, rift, valley, walls, formed, around, a, bulging, of, continental, crust, during, the, breakup, of, southern, gondwana, that, have, since, eroded, inland, from, their, original, positions, near, the, southern, african, coast, and, its, entire, eastern, portion, see, the, accompanying, map, constitutes, the, drakensberg, the, drakensberg, terminate, in, the, north, near, tzaneen, at, about, the, 22, s, parallel, the, absence, of, the, great, escarpment, for, approximately, 450, km, 280, mi, to, the, north, of, tzaneen, to, reappear, on, the, border, between, zimbabwe, and, mozambique, in, the, chimanimani, mountains, is, due, to, a, failed, westerly, branch, of, the, main, rift, that, caused, antarctica, to, start, drifting, away, from, southern, africa, during, the, breakup, of, gondwana, about, 150, million, years, ago, the, lower, limpopo, river, and, save, river, drain, into, the, indian, ocean, through, what, remains, of, this, relict, incipient, rift, valley, which, now, forms, part, of, the, south, african, lowveld, during, the, past, 20, million, years, southern, africa, has, experienced, massive, uplifting, especially, in, the, east, with, the, result, that, most, of, the, plateau, lies, above, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, despite, extensive, erosion, the, plateau, is, tilted, such, that, it, is, highest, in, the, east, and, slopes, gently, downward, toward, the, west, and, south, typically, the, elevation, of, the, edge, of, the, eastern, escarpments, is, in, excess, of, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, it, reaches, its, highest, point, of, over, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, where, the, escarpment, forms, part, of, the, international, border, between, lesotho, and, the, south, african, province, of, kwazulu, natal, the, escarpment, seen, from, below, resembles, a, range, of, mountains, the, limpopo, mpumalanga, and, lesotho, drakensberg, have, hard, erosion, resistant, upper, surfaces, and, therefore, have, a, very, rugged, appearance, combining, steep, sided, blocks, and, pinnacles, giving, rise, to, the, zulu, name, barrier, of, up, pointed, spears, who, first, gave, these, mountains, their, afrikaans, or, dutch, name, drakensberg, and, why, is, unknown, the, kwazulu, natal, free, state, drakensberg, are, composed, of, softer, rocks, and, therefore, have, a, more, rounded, softer, appearance, from, below, generally, the, top, of, the, escarpment, is, almost, table, top, flat, and, smooth, even, in, lesotho, the, lesotho, mountains, are, formed, away, from, the, drakensberg, escarpment, by, erosion, gulleys, which, turn, into, deep, valleys, containing, tributaries, of, the, orange, river, the, large, number, of, such, tributaries, give, the, lesotho, highlands, a, very, rugged, mountainous, appearance, both, from, the, ground, and, from, the, air, the, higher, parts, of, drakensberg, have, a, mildly, periglacial, environment, it, is, possible, that, recent, climate, change, has, diminished, the, intensity, of, periglaciation, knight, and, grab, mapped, out, the, distribution, of, lightning, strikes, in, the, drakensburg, and, discovered, that, lightning, significantly, controls, the, evolution, of, the, mountain, landscapes, because, it, helps, to, shape, the, summit, areas, the, highest, areas, with, this, blasting, effect, previously, angular, debris, was, presumed, to, have, been, created, by, changes, typical, of, cold, periglacial, environments, such, as, fracturing, due, to, frost, the, geological, composition, of, drakensberg, escarpment, wall, varies, considerably, along, its, more, than, 1000, km, length, the, limpopo, and, mpumalanga, drakensberg, are, capped, by, an, erosion, resistant, quartzite, layer, that, is, part, of, the, transvaal, supergroup, which, also, forms, the, magaliesberg, to, the, north, and, northwest, of, pretoria, these, rocks, are, more, than, 2000, million, years, old, south, of, the, 26, s, parallel, the, drakensberg, escarpment, is, composed, of, ecca, shales, which, belong, to, the, karoo, supergroup, and, they, are, 300, million, years, old, the, portion, of, the, drakensberg, that, forms, the, kwazulu, natal, free, state, border, is, formed, by, slightly, younger, beaufort, rocks, 250, million, years, old, that, also, are, part, of, the, karoo, supergroup, the, ecca, and, beaufort, groups, are, composed, of, sedimentary, rocks, that, are, less, erosion, resistant, than, the, other, rocks, that, make, up, the, drakensberg, escarpment, therefore, this, portion, of, escarpment, is, not, so, impressive, as, the, mpumalanga, and, lesotho, stretches, of, the, drakensberg, the, drakensberg, that, form, the, northeastern, and, eastern, borders, of, lesotho, as, well, as, the, eastern, cape, drakensberg, are, composed, of, a, thick, layer, of, basalt, lava, that, erupted, 180, million, years, ago, that, layer, rests, on, the, youngest, of, the, karoo, supergroup, sediments, the, clarens, sandstone, which, was, laid, down, under, desert, conditions, about, 200, million, years, ago, the, highest, peak, is, thabana, ntlenyana, at, 3, 482, m, 11, 424, ft, other, notable, peaks, include, mafadi, 3, 450, m, 11, 319, ft, makoaneng, at, 3, 416, metres, 11, 207, ft, njesuthi, at, 3, 408, metres, 11, 181,

ft, all, of, these, are, in, the, area, bordering, on, lesotho, which, contains, an, area, popular, for, hikers, cathedral, peak, north, of, lesotho, the, range, becomes, lower, and, less, rugged, until, entering, mpumalanga, where, the, quartzite, mountains, of, the, transvaal, drakensberg, are, loftier, and, more, broken, and, they, form, the, eastern, rim, of, the, transvaal, basin, the, blyde, river, canyon, lying, within, this, stretch, the, geology, of, this, section, is, the, same, as, and, continuous, with, that, of, the, magaliesberg, the, high, treeless, peaks, of, the, drakensberg, from, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, upward, have, been, described, by, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, as, the, drakensberg, alti, montane, grasslands, and, woodlands, ecoregion, these, steep, slopes, are, the, most, southerly, high, mountains, in, africa, and, being, farther, from, the, equator, provide, cooler, habitats, at, lower, elevations, than, most, mountain, ranges, on, the, continent, high, rainfall, generates, many, mountain, streams, and, rivers, including, the, sources, of, the, orange, river, southern, africa, s, longest, and, the, tugela, river, these, mountains, also, have, the, world, s, highest, waterfall, the, tugela, falls, thukela, falls, which, has, a, total, drop, of, 947, m, 3, 107, ft, venezuela, s, angel, falls, is, also, a, candidate, for, highest, waterfall, the, rivers, that, run, from, the, drakensberg, are, an, essential, resource, for, south, africa, s, economy, providing, water, for, the, industrial, provinces, of, mpumalanga, and, gauteng, which, contains, the, city, of, johannesburg, the, climate, is, wet, and, cool, at, the, high, elevations, which, experience, snowfall, in, winter, the, grassy, lower, slopes, from, 1, 800, to, 2, 500, m, 5, 900, to, 8, 200, ft, of, the, drakensberg, in, eswatini, south, africa, and, lesotho, constitute, the, drakensberg, montane, grasslands, woodlands, and, forests, ecoregion, the, mountains, are, rich, in, plant, life, including, a, large, number, of, species, listed, in, the, red, data, book, of, threatened, plants, with, 119, species, listed, as, globally, endangered, and, of, the, 2, 153, plant, species, in, the, park, a, remarkable, 98, are, endemic, or, near, endemic, the, flora, of, the, high, alti, montane, grasslands, is, mainly, tussock, grass, creeping, plants, and, small, shrubs, such, as, ericas, these, include, the, rare, spiral, aloe, aloe, polyphylla, which, as, its, name, suggests, has, leaves, with, a, spiral, shape, meanwhile, the, lower, slopes, are, mainly, grassland, but, are, also, home, to, conifers, which, are, rare, in, africa, the, species, of, conifer, found, in, the, drakensberg, belong, to, the, genus, podocarpus, the, grassland, is, of, interest, as, it, contains, a, great, number, of, endemic, plants, grasses, found, here, include, oat, grass, monocymbium, ceresiiforme, diheteropogon, filifolius, sporobolus, centrifugus, caterpillar, grass, harpochloa, falx, cymbopogon, dieterlenii, and, eulalia, villosa, in, the, highest, part, of, drakensberg, the, composition, of, the, flora, is, independent, on, slope, aspect, direction, and, varies, depending, on, the, hardness, of, the, rock, clasts, this, hardness, is, related, to, weathering, and, is, variable, even, within, a, single, landform, the, drakensberg, area, is, home, to, 299, recorded, bird, species, making, up, 37, of, all, non, marine, avian, species, in, southern, africa, there, are, 24, species, of, snakes, in, the, drakensberg, two, of, which, are, highly, venomous, one, bird, is, endemic, to, the, high, peaks, the, mountain, pipit, anthus, hoeschi, and, another, six, species, are, found, mainly, here, bush, blackcap, lioptilus, nigricapillus, buff, streaked, chat, oenanthe, bifasciata, rudd, s, lark, heteromirafra, ruddi, drakensberg, rockjumper, chaetops, aurantius, yellow, breasted, pipit, anthus, chloris, and, drakensberg, siskin, serinus, symonsi, the, endangered, cape, vulture, and, lesser, kestrel, are, two, of, the, birds, of, prey, that, hunt, in, the, mountains, mammals, include, klipspringer, oreotragus, oreotragus,

pseudobarbus, quathlambae, that, was, thought, to, be, extinct, before, being, found, in, the, senqunyane, river, in, lesotho, the, lower, slopes, of, the, drakensberg, support, much, wildlife, perhaps, most, importantly, the, rare, southern, white, rhinoceros, which, was, nurtured, here, when, facing, extinction, and, the, black, wildebeest, connochaetes, gnou, which, as, of, 2011, only, thrives, in, protected, areas, and, game, reserves, the, area, is, home, to, large, herds, of, grazing, fauna, and, antelopes, such, as, eland, taurotragus, oryx, reedbuck, redunca, arundinum, mountain, reedbuck, redunca, fulvorufula, grey, rhebok, pelea, capreolus, and, even, some, oribi, ourebia, ourebi, chacma, baboons, also, are, present, endemic, species, include, a, large, number, of,

drakensberg, park, was, listed, by, unesco, in, 2000, as, a, world, heritage, site, the, park, also, is, in, the, list, of, wetlands, of, international, importance, under, the, ramsar, convention, the, royal, natal, national, park, which, contains, some, of, the, higher, peaks, is, part, of, this, large, park, complex, adjacent, to, the, ukhahlamba, drakensberg, world, heritage, site, is, the, 1900, ha, allendale, mountain, reserve, which, is, the, largest, private, reserve, adjoining, the, world, heritage, site, and, is, found, in, the, accessible, kamberg, area, the, heart, of, the, historic, san, bushman, painting, region, of, the, ukhahlamba, the, grassland, of, the, lower, slopes, has, been, greatly, affected, by, agriculture, however, especially, by, overgrazing, nearly, all, of, the, original, grassland, and, forest, has, disappeared, and, more, protection, is, needed, although, the, giant, s, castle, reserve, is, a, haven, for, the, eland, and, also, is, a, breeding, ground, for, the, bearded, vulture, 5, 81, of, the, drakensberg, montane, grasslands, woodlands, and, forests, ecoregion, is, in, protected, areas, these, include, kruger, national, park, mountain,

conservation, area, was, established, to, preserve, some, of, the, high, mountain, areas, of, the, range, towns, and, cities, in, the, drakensberg, area, include, from, south, to, north, matatiele, and, barkly, east, in, the, eastern, cape, province, ladysmith, newcastle, ulundi, the, former, zulu, capital, dundee, and, ixopo, in, kwazulu, natal, all, of, lesotho, whose, capital, is, maseru, and, tzaneen, in, limpopo, province, there, are, numerous, caves, in, the, easily, eroded, sandstone, of, clarens, formation, the, layer, below, the, thick, hard, basalt, layer, on, the, kwazulu, natal, lesotho, border, many, of, these, caves, have, paintings, by, the, san, bushmen, this, portion, of, the, drakensberg, has, between, 35, 000, and, 40, 000, works, of, san, rock, art, and, is, the, largest, collection, of, such, parietal, work, in, the, world, some, 20, 000, individual, rock, paintings, have, been, recorded, at, 500, different, caves, and, overhanging, sites, between, the, drakensberg, royal, natal, national, park, and, bushman, s, nek, due, to, the, materials, used, in, their, production, these, paintings, are, difficult, to, date, but, there, is, anthropological, evidence, including, many, hunting, implements, that, the, san, people, existed, in, the, drakensberg, at, least, 40, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, more, than, 100, 000, years, ago, according, to, mountainsides, co, za, n, nd, edema, gorge, in, the, central, ginsberg, 3, 900, paintings, have, been, recorded, at, 17, sites, one, of, them, sebaayeni, cave, contains, 1, 146, individual, paintings,
