the, indian, ocean, is, the, third, largest, of, the, world, s, five, oceanic, divisions, covering, 70, 560, 000, km, 2, 27, 240, 000, sq, mi, or, approx, 20, of, the, water, on, earth, s, surface, it, is, bounded, by, asia, to, the, north, africa, to, the, west, and, australia, to, the, east, to, the, south, it, is, bounded, by, the, southern, ocean, or, antarctica, depending, on, the, definition, in, use, along, its, core, the, indian, ocean, has, large, marginal, or, regional, seas, such, as, the, andaman, sea, the, arabian, sea, the, bay, of, bengal, and, the, laccadive, sea, it, is, named, after, india, which, protrudes, into, it, and, has, been, known, by, its, current, name, since, at, least, 1515, it, is, the, only, ocean, to, be, named, after, a, country, previously, it, was, called, the, eastern, ocean, it, has, an, average, depth, of, 3, 741, m, all, of, the, indian, ocean, is, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, unlike, the, atlantic, and, pacific, the, indian, ocean, is, bordered, by, landmasses, and, an, archipelago, on, three, sides, making, it, more, like, an, embayed, ocean, centered, on, the, indian, peninsula, its, coasts, and, shelves, differ, from, other, oceans, with, distinct, features, such, as, a, narrower, continental, shelf, in, terms, of, geology, the, indian, ocean, is, the, youngest, of, the, major, oceans, with, active, spreading, ridges, and, features, like, seamounts, and, ridges, formed, by, hotspots, the, climate, of, the, indian, ocean, is, characterized, by, monsoons, it, is, the, warmest, ocean, with, a, significant, impact, on, global, climate, due, to, its, interaction, with, the, atmosphere, its, waters, are, affected, by, the, indian, ocean, walker, circulation, resulting, in, unique, oceanic, currents, and, upwelling, patterns, the, indian, ocean, is, ecologically, diverse, with, important, marine, life, and, ecosystems, like, coral, reefs, mangroves, and, sea, grass, beds, it, hosts, a, significant, portion, of, the, world, s, tuna, catch, and, is, home, to, endangered, marine, species, it, faces, challenges, like, overfishing, and, pollution, including, a, significant, garbage, patch, historically, the, indian, ocean, has, been, a, hub, of, cultural, and, commercial, exchange, since, ancient, times, it, played, a, key, role, in, early, human, migrations, and, the, spread, of, civilizations, in, modern, times, it, remains, crucial, for, global, trade, especially, in, oil, and, hydrocarbons, environmental, and, geopolitical, concerns, in, the, region, include, the, effects, of, climate, change, piracy, and, strategic, disputes, over, island, territories, the, indian, ocean, has, been, known, by, its, present, name, since, at, least, 1515, when, the, latin, form, oceanus, orientalis, indicus, lit, indian, eastern, ocean, is, attested, named, after, india, which, projects, into, it, it, was, earlier, known, as, the, eastern, ocean, a, term, that, was, still, in, use, during, the, mid, 18th, century, as, opposed, to, the, western, ocean, atlantic, before, the, pacific, was, surmised, in, modern, times, the, name, afro, asian, ocean, has, occasionally, been, used, the, hindi, name, for, the, ocean, is, hind, mah, s, gar, lit, transl, ocean, of, india, conversely, chinese, explorers, e, g, zheng, he, during, the, ming, dynasty, who, traveled, to, the, indian, ocean, during, the, 15th, century, called, it, the, western, oceans, in, ancient, greek, geography, the, indian, ocean, region, known, to, the, greeks, was, called, the, erythraean, sea, the, borders, of, the, indian, ocean, as, delineated, by, the, international, hydrographic, organization, in, 1953, included, the, southern, ocean, but, not, the, marginal, seas, along, the, northern, rim, but, in, 2002, the, iho, delimited, the, southern, ocean, separately, which, removed, waters, south, of, 60, s, from, the, indian, ocean, but, included, the, northern, marginal, seas, meridionally, the, indian, ocean, is, delimited, from, the, atlantic, ocean, by, the, 20, east, meridian, running, south, from, cape, agulhas, south, africa, and, from, the, pacific, ocean, by, the, meridian, of, 146, 49, e, running, south, from, south, east, cape, on, the, island, of, tasmania, in, australia, the, northernmost, extent, of, the, indian, ocean, including, marginal, seas, is, approximately, 30, north, in, the, persian, gulf, the, indian, ocean, covers, 70, 560, 000, km, 2, 27, 240, 000, sq, mi, including, the, red, sea, and, the, persian, gulf, but, excluding, the, southern, ocean, or, 19, 5, of, the, world, s, oceans, its, volume, is, 264, 000, 000, km, 3, 63, 000, 000, cu, mi, or, 19, 8, of, the, world, s, oceans, volume, it, has, an, average, depth, of, 3, 741, m, 12, 274, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 7, 290, m, 23, 920, ft, all, of, the, indian, ocean, is, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, and, the, centre, of, the, eastern, hemisphere, the, 90th, meridian, east, passes, through, the, ninety, east, ridge, in, contrast, to, the, atlantic, and, pacific, the, indian, ocean, is, enclosed, by, major, landmasses, and, an, archipelago, on, three, sides, and, does, not, stretch, from, pole, to, pole, and, can, be, likened, to, an, embayed, ocean, it, is, centered, on, the, indian, peninsula, although, this, subcontinent, has, played, a, significant, role, in, its, history, the, indian, ocean, has, foremostly, been, a, cosmopolitan, stage, interlinking, diverse, regions, by, innovations, trade, and, religion, since, early, in, human, history, the, active, margins, of, the, indian, ocean, have, an, average, width, horizontal, distance, from, land, to, shelf, break, of, 19, 0, 61, km, 11, 81, 0, 38, mi, with, a, maximum, width, of, 175, km, 109, mi, the, passive, margins, have, an, average, width, of, 47, 6, 0, 8, km, 29, 58, 0, 50, mi, the, average, width, of, the, slopes, horizontal, distance, from, shelf, break, to, foot, of, slope, of, the, continental, shelves, are, 50, 4, 52, 4, km, 31, 3, 32, 6, mi, for, active, and, passive, margins, respectively, with, a, maximum, width, of, 205, 3, 255, 2, km, 127, 6, 158, 6, mi, in, correspondence, of, the, shelf, break, also, known, as, hinge, zone, the, bouguer, gravity, ranges, from, 0, to, 30, mgals, that, is, unusual, for, a, continental, region, of, around, 16, km, thick, sediments, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, hinge, zone, may, represent, the, relict, of, continental, and, proto, oceanic, crustal, boundary, formed, during, the, rifting, of, india, from, antarctica, australia, indonesia, and, india, are, the, three, countries, with, the, longest, shorelines, and, exclusive, economic, zones, the, continental, shelf, makes, up, 15, of, the, indian, ocean, more, than, two,

ocean, the, indian, ocean, drainage, basin, covers, 21, 100, 000, km, 2, 8, 100, 000, sq, mi, virtually, identical, to, that, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, half, that, of, the, atlantic, basin, or, 30, of, its, ocean, surface, compared, to, 15, for, the, pacific, the, indian, ocean, drainage, basin, is, divided, into, roughly, 800, individual, basins, half, that, of, the, pacific, of, which, 50, are, located, in, asia, 30, in, africa, and, 20, in, australasia, the, rivers, of, the, indian, ocean, are, shorter, on, average, 740, km, 460, mi, than, those, of, the, other, major, oceans, the, largest, rivers, are, order, 5, the, zambezi, ganges, brahmaputra, indus, jubba, and, murray, rivers, and, order, 4, the, shatt, al, arab, wadi, ad, dawasir, a, dried, out, river, system, on, the,

indonesia, the, so, called, indonesian, seaway, is, composed, of, the, malacca, sunda, and, torres, straits, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, is, located, on, the, australian, north, coast, while, the, great, australian, bight, constitutes, a, large, part, of, its, southern, coast, several, features, make, the, indian, ocean, unique, it, constitutes, the, core, of, the, large, scale, tropical, warm, pool, which, when, interacting, with, the, atmosphere, affects, the, climate, both, regionally, and, globally, asia, blocks, heat, export, and, prevents, the, ventilation, of, the, indian, ocean, thermocline, that, continent, also, drives, the, indian, ocean, monsoon, the, strongest, on, earth, which, causes, large, scale, seasonal, variations, in, ocean, currents, including, the, reversal, of, the, somali, current, and, indian, monsoon, current, because, of, the, indian, ocean, walker, circulation, there, are, no, continuous, equatorial, easterlies, upwelling, occurs, near, the, horn, of, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, north, of, the, trade, winds, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, indonesian, throughflow, is, a, unique, equatorial, connection, to, the, pacific, the, climate, north, of, the, equator, is, affected, by, a, monsoon, climate, strong, north, east, winds, blow, from, october, until, april, from, may, until, october, south, and, west, winds, prevail, in, the, arabian, sea, the, violent, monsoon, brings, rain, to, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, winds, are, generally, milder, but, summer, storms, near, mauritius, can, be, severe, when, the, monsoon, winds, change, cyclones, sometimes, strike, the, shores, of, the, arabian, sea, and, the, bay, of, bengal, some, 80, of, the, total, annual, rainfall, in, india, occurs, during, summer, and, the, region, is, so, dependent, on, this, rainfall, that, many, civilisations, perished, when, the, monsoon, failed, in, the, past, the, huge, variability, in, the, indian, summer, monsoon, has, also, occurred, pre, historically, with, a, strong, wet, phase, 33, 500, 32, 500, bp, a, weak, dry, phase, 26, 000, 23, 500, bc, and, a, very, weak, phase, 17, 000, 15, 000, bp, corresponding, to, a, series, of, dramatic, global, events, b, lling, aller, d, warming, heinrich, and, younger, dryas, the, indian, ocean, is, the, warmest, ocean, in, the, world, long, term, ocean, temperature, records, show, a, rapid, continuous, warming, in, the, indian, ocean, at, about, 1, 2, c, 34, 2, f, compared, to, 0, 7, c, 33, 3, f, for, the, warm, pool, region, during, 1901, 2012, research, indicates, that, human, induced, greenhouse, warming, and, changes, in, the, frequency, and, magnitude, of, el, ni, o, or, the, indian, ocean, dipole, events, are, a, trigger, to, this, strong, warming, in, the, indian, ocean, while, the, indian, ocean, warmed, at, a, rate, of, 1, 2, c, per, century, during, 1950, 2020, climate, models, predict, accelerated, warming, at, a, rate, of, 1, 7, c, 3, 8, c, per, century, during, 2020, 2100, though, the, warming, is, basin, wide, maximum, warming, is, in, the, northwestern, indian, ocean, including, the, arabian, sea, and, reduced, warming, off, the, sumatra, and, java, coasts, in, the, southeast, indian, ocean, global, warming, is, projected, to, push, the, tropical, indian, ocean, into, a, basin, wide, near, permanent, heatwave, state, by, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, where, marine, heatwaves, are, projected, to, increase, from, 20, days, per, year, during, 1970, 2000, to, 220, 250, days, per, year, south, of, the, equator, 20, 5, s, the, indian, ocean, is, gaining, heat, from, june, to, october, during, the, austral, winter, while, it, is, losing, heat, from, november, to, march, during, the, austral, summer, in, 1999, the, indian, ocean, experiment, showed, that, fossil, fuel, and, biomass, burning, in, south, and, southeast, asia, caused, air, pollution, also, known, as, the, asian, brown, cloud, that, reach, as, far, as, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, this, pollution, has, implications, on, both, a, local, and, global, scale, forty, percent, of, the, sediment, of, the, indian, ocean, is, found, in, the, indus, and, ganges, fans, the, oceanic, basins, adjacent, to, the, continental, slopes, mostly, contain, terrigenous, sediments, the, ocean, south, of, the, polar, front, roughly, 50, south, latitude, is, high, in, biologic, productivity, and, dominated, by, non, stratified, sediment, composed, mostly, of, siliceous, oozes, near, the, three, major, mid, ocean, ridges, the, ocean, floor, is, relatively, young, and, therefore, bare, of, sediment, except, for, the, southwest, indian, ridge, due, to, its, ultra, slow, spreading, rate, the, ocean, s, currents, are, mainly, controlled, by, the, monsoon, two, large, gyres, one, in, the, northern, hemisphere, flowing, clockwise, and, one, south, of, the, equator, moving, anticlockwise, including, the, agulhas, current, and, agulhas, return, current, constitute, the, dominant, flow, pattern, during, the, winter, monsoon, november, february, however, circulation, is, reversed, north, of, 30, s, and, winds, are, weakened, during, winter, and, the, transitional, periods, between, the, monsoons, the, indian, ocean, contains, the, largest, submarine, fans, of, the, world, the, bengal, fan, and, indus, fan, and, the, largest, areas, of, slope, terraces, and, rift, valleys, the, inflow, of, deep, water, into, the, indian, ocean, is, 11, sv, most, of, which, comes, from, the, circumpolar, deep, water, cdw, the, cdw, enters, the, indian, ocean, through, the, crozet, and, madagascar, basins, and, crosses, the, southwest, indian, ridge, at, 30, s, in, the, mascarene, basin, the, cdw, becomes, a, deep, western, boundary, current, before, it, is, met, by, a, re, circulated, branch, of, itself, the, north, indian, deep, water, this, mixed, water, partly, flows, north, into, the, somali, basin, whilst, most, of, it, flows, clockwise, in, the, mascarene, basin, where, an, oscillating, flow, is, produced, by, rossby, waves, water, circulation, in, the, indian, ocean, is, dominated, by, the, subtropical, anticyclonic, gyre, the, eastern, extension, of, which, is, blocked, by, the, southeast, indian, ridge, and, the, 90, e, ridge, madagascar, and, the, southwest, indian, ridge, separate, three, cells, south, of, madagascar, and, off, south, africa, north, atlantic, deep, water, reaches, into, the, indian, ocean, south, of, africa, at, a, depth, of, 2, 000, 3, 000, m, 6, 600, 9, 800, ft, and, flows, north, along, the, eastern, continental, slope, of, africa, deeper, than, nadw, antarctic, bottom, water, flows, from, enderby, basin, to, agulhas, basin, across, deep, channels, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, in, the, southwest, indian, ridge, from, where, it, continues, into, the, mozambique, channel, and, prince, edward, fracture, zone, north, of, 20, south, latitude, the, minimum, surface, temperature, is, 22, c, 72, f, exceeding, 28, c, 82, f, to, the, east, southward, of, 40, south, latitude, temperatures, drop, quickly, the, bay, of, bengal, contributes, more, than, half, 2, 950, km, 3, or, 710, cu, mi, of, the, runoff, water, to, the, indian, ocean, mainly, in, summer, this, runoff, flows, into, the, arabian, sea, but, also, south, across, the, equator, where, it, mixes, with, fresher, seawater, from, the, indonesian, throughflow, this, mixed, freshwater, joins, the, south, equatorial, current, in, the, southern, tropical, indian, ocean, sea, surface, salinity, is, highest, more, than, 36, psu, in, the, arabian, sea, because, evaporation, exceeds, precipitation, there, in, the, southeast, arabian, sea, salinity, drops, to, less, than, 34, psu, it, is, the, lowest, c, 33, psu, in, the, bay, of, bengal, because, of, river, runoff, and, precipitation, the, indonesian, throughflow, and, precipitation, results, in, lower, salinity, 34, psu, along, the, sumatran, west, coast, monsoonal, variation, results, in, eastward, transportation, of, saltier, water, from, the, arabian, sea, to, the, bay, of, bengal, from, june, to, september, and, in, westerly, transport, by, the, east, india, coastal, current, to, the, arabian, sea, from, january, to, april, an, indian, ocean, garbage, patch, was, discovered, in, 2010, covering, at, least, 5, million, square, kilometres, 1, 9, million, square, miles, riding, the, southern, indian, ocean, gyre, this, vortex, of, plastic, garbage, constantly, circulates, the, ocean, from, australia, to, africa, down, the, mozambique, channel, and, back, to, australia, in, a, period, of, six, years, except, for, debris, that, gets, indefinitely, stuck, in, the, centre, of, the, gyre, the, garbage, patch, in, the, indian, ocean, will, according, to, a, 2012, study, decrease, in, size, after, several, decades, to, vanish, completely, over, centuries, over, several, millennia, however, the, global, system, of, garbage, patches, will, accumulate, in, the, north, pacific, there, are, two, amphidromes, of, opposite, rotation, in, the, indian, ocean, probably, caused, by, rossby, wave, propagation, icebergs, drift, as, far, north, as, 55, south, latitude, similar, to, the, pacific, but, less, than, in, the, atlantic, where, icebergs, reach, up, to, 45, s, the, volume, of, iceberg, loss, in, the, indian, ocean, between, 2004, and, 2012, was, 24, gt, since, the, 1960s, anthropogenic, warming, of, the, global, ocean, combined, with, contributions, of, freshwater, from, retreating, land, ice, causes, a, global, rise, in, sea, level, sea, level, also, increases, in, the, indian, ocean, except, in, the, south, tropical, indian, ocean, where, it, decreases, a, pattern, most, likely, caused, by, rising, levels, of, greenhouse, gases, among, the, tropical, oceans, the, western, indian, ocean, hosts, one, of, the, largest, concentrations, of, phytoplankton, blooms, in, summer, due, to, the, strong, monsoon, winds, the, monsoonal, wind, forcing, leads, to, a, strong, coastal, and, open, ocean, upwelling, which, introduces, nutrients, into, the, upper, zones, where, sufficient, light, is, available, for, photosynthesis, and, phytoplankton, production, these, phytoplankton, blooms, support, the, marine, ecosystem, as, the, base, of, the, marine, food, web, and, eventually, the, larger, fish, species, the, indian, ocean, accounts, for, the, second, largest, share, of, the, most, economically, valuable, tuna, catch, its, fish, are, of, great, and, growing, importance, to, the, bordering, countries, for, domestic, consumption, and, export, fishing, fleets, from, russia, japan, south, korea, and, taiwan, also, exploit, the, indian, ocean, mainly, for, shrimp, and, tuna, research, indicates, that, increasing, ocean, temperatures, are, taking, a, toll, on, the, marine, ecosystem, a, study, on, the, phytoplankton, changes, in, the, indian, ocean, indicates, a, decline, of, up, to, 20, in, the, marine, plankton, in, the, indian, ocean, during, the, past, six, decades, the, tuna, catch, rates, have, also, declined, 50, 90, during, the, past, half, century, mostly, due, to, increased, industrial, fisheries, with, the, ocean, warming, adding, further, stress, to, the, fish, species, endangered, and, vulnerable, marine, mammals, and, turtles, 80, of, the, indian, ocean, is, open, ocean, and, includes, nine, large, marine, ecosystems, the, agulhas, current, somali, coastal, current, red, sea, arabian, sea, bay, of, bengal, gulf, of, thailand, west, central, australian, shelf, northwest, australian, shelf, and, southwest, australian, shelf, coral, reefs, cover, c, 200, 000, km, 2, 77, 000, sq, mi, the, coasts, of, the, indian, ocean, includes, beaches, and, intertidal, zones, covering, 3, 000, km, 2, 1, 200, sq, mi, and, 246, larger, estuaries, upwelling, areas, are, small, but, important, the, hypersaline, salterns, in, india, covers, between, 5, 000, 10, 000, km, 2, 1, 900, 3, 900, sq, mi, and, species, adapted, for, this, environment, such, as, artemia, salina, and, dunaliella, salina, are, important, to, bird, life, coral, reefs, sea, grass, beds, and, mangrove, forests, are, the, most, productive, ecosystems, of, the, indian, ocean, coastal, areas, produce, 20, tones, of, fish, per, square, kilometre, these, areas, however, are, also, being, urbanised, with, populations, often, exceeding, several, thousand, people, per, square, kilometre, and, fishing, techniques, become, more, effective, and, often, destructive, beyond, sustainable, levels, while, the, increase, in, sea, surface, temperature, spreads, coral, bleaching, mangroves, covers, 80, 984, km, 2, 31, 268, sq, mi, in, the, indian, ocean, region, or, almost, half, of, the, world, s, mangrove, habitat, of, which, 42, 500, km, 2, 16, 400, sq, mi, is, located, in, indonesia, or, 50, of, mangroves, in, the, indian, ocean, mangroves, originated, in, the, indian, ocean, region, and, have, adapted, to, a, wide, range, of, its, habitats, but, it, is, also, where, it, suffers, its, biggest, loss, of, habitat, in, 2016, six, new, animal, species, were, identified, at, hydrothermal, vents, in, the, southwest, indian, ridge, a, hoff, crab, a, giant, peltospirid, snail, a, whelk, like, snail, a, limpet, a, scaleworm, and, a, polychaete, worm, the, west, indian, ocean, coelacanth, was, discovered, in, the, indian, ocean, off, south, africa, in, the, 1930s, and, in, the, late, 1990s, another, species, the, indonesian, coelacanth, was, discovered, off, sulawesi, island, indonesia, most, extant, coelacanths, have, been, found, in, the, comoros, although, both, species, represent, an, order, of, lobe, finned, fishes, known, from, the, early, devonian, 410, mya, and, though, extinct, 66, mya, they, are, morphologically, distinct, from, their, devonian, ancestors, over, millions, of, years, coelacanths, evolved, to, inhabit, different, environments, lungs, adapted, for, shallow, brackish, waters, evolved, into, gills, adapted, for, deep, marine, waters, of, earth, s, 36, biodiversity,

varied, from, series, of, minor, tsunamis, over, a, century, to, dormant, periods, of, more, than, 2000, years, preceding, megathrusts, in, the, sunda, trench, although, the, risk, for, future, tsunamis, is, high, a, major, megathrust, such, as, the, one, in, 2004, is, likely, to, be, followed, by, a, long, dormant, period, a, group, of, scientists, have, argued, that, two, large, scale, impact, events, have, occurred, in, the, indian, ocean, the, burckle, crater, in, the, southern, indian, ocean, in, 2800, bce, and, the, kanmare, and, tabban, craters, in, the, gulf, of, carpentaria,
