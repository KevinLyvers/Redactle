lake, erie, r, i, eer, ee, french, lac, ri, is, the, fourth, largest, lake, by, surface, area, of, the, five, great, lakes, in, north, america, and, the, eleventh, largest, globally, it, is, the, southernmost, shallowest, and, smallest, by, volume, of, the, great, lakes, and, also, has, the, shortest, average, water, residence, time, at, its, deepest, point, lake, erie, is, 210, feet, 64, m, deep, making, it, the, only, great, lake, whose, deepest, point, is, above, sea, level, situated, on, the, international, boundary, between, canada, and, the, united, states, lake, erie, s, northern, shore, is, the, canadian, province, of, ontario, specifically, the, ontario, peninsula, with, the, u, s, states, of, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, and, new, york, on, its, western, southern, and, eastern, shores, these, jurisdictions, divide, the, surface, area, of, the, lake, with, water, boundaries, the, largest, city, on, the, lake, is, cleveland, anchoring, the, third, largest, u, s, metro, area, in, the, great, lakes, region, after, greater, chicago, and, metro, detroit, other, major, cities, along, the, lake, shore, include, buffalo, new, york, erie, pennsylvania, and, toledo, ohio, situated, below, lake, huron, erie, s, primary, inlet, is, the, detroit, river, the, main, natural, outflow, from, the, lake, is, via, the, niagara, river, which, provides, hydroelectric, power, to, canada, and, the, u, s, as, it, spins, huge, turbines, near, niagara, falls, at, lewiston, new, york, and, queenston, ontario, some, outflow, occurs, via, the, welland, canal, part, of, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, which, diverts, water, for, ship, passages, from, port, colborne, ontario, on, lake, erie, to, st, catharines, on, lake, ontario, an, elevation, difference, of, 326, ft, 99, m, lake, erie, s, environmental, health, has, been, an, ongoing, concern, for, decades, with, issues, such, as, overfishing, pollution, algae, blooms, and, eutrophication, generating, headlines, lake, erie, 42, 2, n, 81, 2w, has, a, mean, elevation, of, 571, feet, 174, m, above, sea, level, it, has, a, surface, area, of, 9, 990, square, miles, 25, 874, km, 2, with, a, length, of, 241, statute, miles, 388, km, 209, nmi, and, breadth, of, 57, statute, miles, 92, km, 50, nmi, at, its, widest, points, it, is, the, shallowest, of, the, great, lakes, with, an, average, depth, of, 10, fathoms, 3, feet, or, 63, ft, 19, m, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 35, fathoms, 210, ft, 64, m, because, erie, is, the, shallowest, it, is, also, the, warmest, of, the, great, lakes, and, in, 1999, this, almost, became, a, problem, for, two, nuclear, power, plants, which, require, cool, lake, water, to, keep, their, reactors, cool, the, warm, summer, of, 1999, caused, lake, temperatures, to, come, close, to, the, 85, f, 29, c, limit, necessary, to, keep, the, plants, cool, also, because, of, its, shallowness, it, is, the, first, to, freeze, in, the, winter, the, shallowest, section, of, lake, erie, is, the, western, basin, where, depths, average, only, 25, to, 30, feet, 7, 6, to, 9, 1, m, as, a, result, the, slightest, breeze, can, kick, up, lively, waves, also, known, as, seiches, the, waves, build, very, quickly, according, to, other, accounts, the, region, around, the, lake, is, known, as, the, thunderstorm, capital, of, canada, with, breathtaking, lightning, displays, sometimes, fierce, waves, springing, up, unexpectedly, have, led, to, dramatic, rescues, in, one, instance, a, cleveland, resident, trying, to, measure, the, dock, near, his, house, became, trapped, but, was, rescued, by, a, fire, department, diver, from, avon, lake, ohio, in, a, tug, of, war, against, the, waves, the, two, were, finally, hauled, out, by, rope, after, being, trapped, for, an, hour, and, a, half, baker, was, back, on, dry, land, exhausted, and, battered, but, alive, lake, erie, is, primarily, fed, by, the, detroit, river, from, lake, huron, and, lake, st, clair, and, drains, via, the, niagara, river, and, niagara, falls, into, lake, ontario, navigation, downstream, is, provided, by, the, welland, canal, part, of, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, other, major, contributors, to, lake, erie, include, grand, river, huron, river, maumee, river, sandusky, river, cuyahoga, river, and, buffalo, river, the, drainage, basin, covers, 30, 140, square, miles, 78, 100, km, 2, point, pelee, national, park, the, southernmost, point, of, the, canadian, mainland, is, located, on, a, peninsula, extending, into, the, lake, lake, erie, has, 31, islands, 13, in, canada, 18, in, the, u, s, located, generally, in, the, western, side, of, the, lake, the, largest, of, these, is, pelee, island, lake, erie, has, a, lake, retention, time, of, 2, 6, years, the, shortest, of, all, the, great, lakes, the, lake, s, surface, area, is, 9, 910, square, miles, 25, 667, km, 2, lake, erie, s, water, level, fluctuates, with, the, seasons, as, in, the, other, great, lakes, generally, the, lowest, levels, are, in, january, and, february, and, the, highest, in, june, or, july, although, there, have, been, exceptions, the, average, yearly, level, varies, depending, on, long, term, precipitation, short, term, level, changes, are, often, caused, by, seiches, that, are, particularly, high, when, southwesterly, winds, blow, across, the, length, of, the, lake, during, storms, these, cause, water, to, pile, up, at, the, eastern, end, of, the, lake, storm, driven, seiches, can, cause, damage, onshore, during, one, storm, in, november, 2003, the, water, level, at, buffalo, rose, by, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, with, waves, of, 10, 15, feet, 3, 0, 4, 6, metres, for, a, rise, of, 22, feet, 6, 7, m, meanwhile, at, the, western, end, of, the, lake, toledo, experienced, a, similar, drop, in, water, level, lake, erie, was, carved, out, by, glacier, ice, and, in, its, current, form, is, less, than, 4, 000, years, old, which, is, a, short, span, in, geological, terms, before, this, the, land, on, which, the, lake, now, sits, went, through, several, complex, stages, a, large, lowland, basin, formed, over, two, million, years, ago, as, a, result, of, an, eastern, flowing, river, that, existed, well, before, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, this, ancient, drainage, system, was, destroyed, by, the, first, major, glacier, in, the, area, while, it, deepened, and, enlarged, the, lowland, areas, allowing, water, to, settle, and, form, a, lake, the, glaciers, were, able, to, carve, away, more, land, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, lowland, because, the, bedrock, is, made, of, shale, which, is, softer, than, the, carbonate, rocks, of, dolomite, and, limestone, on, the, western, side, thus, the, eastern, and, central, basins, of, the, modern, lake, are, much, deeper, than, the, western, basin, which, averages, only, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, deep, and, is, rich, in, nutrients, and, fish, lake, erie, is, the, shallowest, of, the, great, lakes, because, the, ice, was, relatively, thin, and, lacked, erosion, power, when, it, reached, that, far, south, according, to, one, view, as, many, as, three, glaciers, advanced, and, retreated, over, the, land, causing, temporary, lakes, to, form, in, the, time, periods, in, between, each, of, them, because, each, lake, had, a, different, volume, of, water, their, shorelines, rested, at, differing, elevations, the, last, of, these, lakes, to, form, lake, warren, existed, between, about, 13, 000, and, 12, 000, years, ago, it, was, deeper, than, the, current, lake, erie, and, its, shoreline, existed, about, eight, miles, 13, km, inland, from, the, modern, one, the, shorelines, of, these, lakes, left, behind, high, ground, sand, ridges, that, cut, through, swamps, and, were, used, as, trails, for, native, peoples, and, later, pioneers, these, trails, became, primitive, roads, which, were, eventually, paved, u, s, route, 30, west, of, delphos, ohio, and, u, s, route, 20, west, of, norwalk, and, east, of, cleveland, were, formed, in, this, manner, the, ancient, sand, dunes, are, visible, in, the, oak, openings, region, in, northwest, ohio, there, the, sandy, dry, lake, bed, soil, was, not, sufficient, to, support, large, trees, with, the, exception, of, a, few, species, of, oaks, forming, a, rare, oak, savanna, at, the, time, of, european, contact, there, were, several, indigenous, peoples, living, around, the, shores, of, the, eastern, end, of, the, lake, the, erie, tribe, from, whom, the, lake, takes, its, name, lived, along, the, southern, edge, while, the, neutrals, also, known, as, attawandaron, lived, along, the, northern, shore, the, tribal, name, erie, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, iroquoian, word, erielhonan, meaning, long, tail, the, name, may, also, come, from, the, word, eri, meaning, cherry, tree, near, port, stanley, there, is, an, indigenous, village, dating, from, the, 16th, century, known, as, the, southwold, earthworks, where, as, many, as, 800, neutral, indigenous, peoples, once, lived, the, archaeological, remains, include, double, earth, walls, winding, around, the, grass, covered, perimeter, europeans, named, the, tribe, the, neutral, indians, since, these, people, refused, to, fight, with, other, tribes, both, the, erie, and, neutrals, were, colonized, and, assimilated, by, their, hostile, eastern, neighbors, the, iroquois, confederacy, between, 1651, and, 1657, during, the, beaver, wars, for, decades, after, those, wars, the, land, around, eastern, lake, erie, was, claimed, and, utilized, by, the, iroquois, as, a, hunting, ground, as, the, power, of, the, iroquois, waned, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 17th, century, several, other, mainly, anishinaabe, displaced, them, from, the, territories, they, claimed, on, the, north, shore, of, the, lake, there, was, a, legend, of, an, indigenous, woman, named, huldah, who, despairing, over, her, lost, british, lover, hurled, herself, from, a, high, rock, from, pelee, island, in, 1669, frenchman, louis, jolliet, was, the, first, documented, european, to, sight, lake, erie, although, there, is, speculation, that, tienne, br, l, may, have, come, across, it, in, 1615, lake, erie, was, the, last, of, the, great, lakes, to, be, explored, by, europeans, since, the, iroquois, who, occupied, the, niagara, river, area, were, in, conflict, with, the, french, and, they, did, not, allow, explorers, or, traders, to, pass, through, explorers, followed, rivers, out, of, lake, ontario, and, portaged, to, lake, huron, british, authorities, in, canada, were, nervous, about, possible, expansion, by, american, settlers, across, lake, erie, so, colonel, thomas, talbot, developed, the, talbot, trail, in, 1809, as, a, way, to, stimulate, settlement, to, the, area, talbot, recruited, settlers, from, ireland, and, scotland, and, there, are, numerous, places, named, after, him, in, southern, ontario, such, as, port, talbot, the, talbot, river, and, talbotville, during, the, war, of, 1812, oliver, hazard, perry, captured, an, entire, british, fleet, in, 1813, near, put, in, bay, ohio, despite, having, inferior, numbers, american, soldiers, swept, through, the, ontario, area, around, port, rowan, burning, towns, and, villages, generally, however, with, the, exceptions, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, the, war, of, 1812, which, involved, conflicts, between, the, u, s, and, the, united, kingdom, relations, between, the, u, s, and, canada, have, been, remarkably, friendly, with, an, unfortified, boundary, and, an, agreement, that, has, kept, all, fleets, of, war, off, the, great, lakes, in, 1837, rebellions, broke, about, between, canadian, settlers, and, the, british, colonial, government, these, primarily, concerned, political, reforms, and, land, allocation, issues, some, of, the, rebels, stationed, themselves, in, the, u, s, and, crossed, the, ice, from, sandusky, bay, to, pelee, island, wearing, tattered, overcoats, and, worn, out, boots, and, carrying, muskets, pitchforks, and, swords, but, the, islanders, had, already, fled, later, there, was, a, battle, on, the, ice, with, the, royal, 32nd, regiment, with, the, rebels, being, driven, to, retreat, settlers, established, commercial, fisheries, on, the, north, coast, of, the, lake, around, the, 1850s, an, important, business, was, fishing, in, the, pre, civil, war, years, railways, sprouted, everywhere, and, around, 1852, there, were, railways, circling, the, lake, maritime, traffic, picked, up, although, the, lake, was, usually, closed, because, of, ice, from, december, to, early, april, and, ships, had, to, wait, for, the, ice, to, clear, before, proceeding, since, slavery, had, been, abolished, in, canada, in, 1833, but, was, still, legal, in, southern, u, s, a, lake, erie, crossing, was, sometimes, required, for, fugitive, slaves, seeking, freedom, when, kentucky, fugitive, lewis, clarke, arrived, in, cleveland, he, had, no, idea, how, to, find, canada, i, went, out, to, the, shore, of, the, lake, again, and, again, to, try, and, see, the, other, side, but, i, could, see, no, hill, mountain, nor, city, of, the, asylum, i, sought, he, once, told, an, interviewer, i, was, afraid, to, inquire, where, canada, was, lest, it, would, betray, such, a, degree, of, ignorance, as, to, excite, suspicion, at, once, many, fugitives, also, had, to, overcome, fears, instilled, by, their, former, masters, prior, to, modern, radar, and, weather, forecasting, merchant, ships, were, often, caught, up, in, intense, gales, a, violent, gale, is, blowing, on, lake, erie, the, schooner, stranger, came, in, this, morning, and, reports, seeing, a, vessel, about, 12, miles, up, 2, miles, from, the, canada, shore, with, three, men, clinging, to, the, masts, which, alone, were, visible, above, the, water, heard, their, cries, and, screams, there, were, reports, of, disasters, usually, from, sea, captains, passing, information, to, reporters, in, 1868, the, captain, of, the, grace, whitney, saw, a, sunken, vessel, with, three, men, clinging, to, the, masthead, but, he, could, not, help, because, of, the, gale, and, high, seas, a, balloonist, named, john, steiner, of, philadelphia, made, an, ambitious, trip, across, the, lake, in, 1857, his, voyage, was, described, in, the, new, york, times, he, arose, to, the, height, of, about, three, miles, and, started, off, at, a, slow, but, steady, rate, the, lake, could, be, seen, from, one, end, to, the, other, nearly, at, one, time, mr, steiner, counted, 38, sail, vessels, all, in, sight, and, far, below, him, the, hands, on, board, several, of, the, vessels, saw, him, and, rightly, apprehending, that, he, was, an, aeronaut, cheered, him, heartily, he, neared, the, canada, shore, a, little, below, long, point, he, was, accordingly, driven, towards, buffalo, night, was, drawing, on, and, it, became, apparent, that, he, could, not, with, this, current, get, away, from, the, water, before, dark, and, after, nightfall, it, would, not, be, safe, to, come, down, seeing, a, propeller, powered, boat, the, mary, stewart, he, first, struck, the, water, about, 25, miles, below, long, point, during, this, time, mr, steiner, says, he, thinks, his, balloon, bounded, from, the, water, at, least, twenty, times, it, would, strike, and, then, rebound, like, a, ball, going, into, the, air, from, twenty, to, fifty, feet, and, still, rushing, down, the, lake, at, railroad, speed, mr, steiner, then, abandoned, the, balloon, leaping, into, the, water, and, swimming, towards, the, boat, which, speedily, reached, him, in, 1885, lake, winds, were, so, strong, that, water, levels, dropped, substantially, sometimes, by, as, much, as, two, feet, so, that, at, ports, such, as, toledo, watercraft, could, not, load, coal, or, depart, the, port, during, the, history, of, the, lake, as, a, fishery, there, has, been, marked, battling, by, opposing, interest, groups, the, preservation, of, the, fisheries, of, lake, erie, has, become, a, serious, problem, to, all, who, have, given, it, close, attention, the, fisheries, are, being, exhausted, by, the, wasteful, methods, which, are, now, in, vogue, it, is, still, the, custom, of, the, pound, fishermen, about, sandusky, to, take, fish, of, all, sizes, and, if, they, are, too, small, to, be, marketable, they, are, turned, over, to, a, fertilizer, factory, if, left, undisturbed, for, two, or, three, years, more, these, little, fish, would, be, a, very, valuable, product, predictions, of, the, lake, being, over, fished, in, 1895, were, premature, since, the, fishery, has, survived, commercial, and, sport, fishing, pollution, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, invasive, species, and, other, ailments, but, state, and, provincial, governments, as, well, as, national, governments, have, played, a, greater, role, as, time, went, by, business, boomed, in, 1901, the, carnegie, company, proposed, building, a, new, harbor, near, erie, pennsylvania, in, elk, creek, to, accommodate, shipments, from, its, tube, plant, site, nearby, in, 1913, a, memorial, to, commodore, oliver, hazard, perry, was, built, on, put, in, bay, island, featuring, a, doric, column, steamships, have, operated, on, lake, erie, since, the, early, 1800s, large, opulent, cruise, liners, carried, passengers, between, detroit, cleveland, buffalo, and, other, cities, on, the, lake, until, the, rise, of, the, automobile, in, the, 1950s, drastically, cut, demand, for, their, services, the, detroit, and, cleveland, navigation, company, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, renowned, of, these, companies, during, the, prohibition, years, from, 1919, to, 1933, a, great, deal, of, alcohol, crossed, erie, along, with, mobster, corpses, dumped, into, the, detroit, river, which, sometimes, washed, up, on, the, beaches, of, pelee, island, notable, rum, runners, included, thomas, joseph, mcginty, and, the, purple, gang, the, coast, guard, attempted, to, interdict, the, canadian, liquor, with, its, rum, patrol, and, a, casino, operated, on, middle, island, during, the, 20th, century, commercial, fishing, was, prevalent, but, so, was, the, boom, in, manufacturing, industry, around, the, lake, and, often, rivers, and, streams, were, used, as, sewers, to, flush, untreated, sewage, which, ended, up, in, the, lake, sometimes, poorly, constructed, sanitary, systems, meant, that, when, old, pipes, broke, raw, sewage, would, spill, directly, into, the, cuyahoga, river, and, into, the, lake, a, report, in, time, magazine, in, 1969, described, the, lake, as, a, gigantic, cesspool, since, only, three, of, 62, beaches, were, rated, completely, safe, for, swimming, by, 1975, the, popular, commercial, fish, blue, pike, had, been, declared, extinct, although, the, declaration, may, have, been, premature, by, the, 1980s, there, were, about, 130, fishing, vessels, with, about, 3, 000, workers, but, commercial, fishing, was, declining, rapidly, particularly, from, the, american, side, in, 2005, the, great, lakes, states, of, ohio, michigan, new, york, pennsylvania, illinois, indiana, wisconsin, and, minnesota, and, the, canadian, provinces, of, ontario, and, quebec, endorsed, the, great, lakes, st, lawrence, river, basin, sustainable, water, resources, compact, it, was, signed, into, law, by, president, george, w, bush, in, september, 2008, an, international, water, rights, policy, overseen, by, the, great, lakes, commission, the, compact, aims, to, prevent, diversion, of, water, from, great, lakes, to, distant, states, as, well, as, to, set, standards, for, use, and, conservation, it, had, support, from, both, political, parties, including, united, states, senator, george, voinovich, of, ohio, and, governor, jennifer, granholm, of, michigan, but, is, not, popular, in, the, southwestern, states, because, of, frequent, drought, conditions, and, water, scarcity, like, the, other, great, lakes, erie, produces, lake, effect, snow, when, the, first, cold, winds, of, winter, pass, over, the, warm, waters, when, the, temperatures, of, the, relatively, warm, surface, water, and, the, colder, air, separate, to, at, least, 18, f, 10, c, to, 23, f, 13, c, apart, then, lake, effect, snow, becomes, possible, as, cold, air, flows, over, the, warm, water, the, lake, warms, and, moistens, the, air, since, warm, moist, air, is, less, dense, than, cold, air, the, heated, air, rises, rising, air, cools, and, water, vapor, condenses, into, cloud, droplets, the, efficiency, of, snow, production, increases, when, the, wind, pushes, the, clouds, over, land, friction, with, the, ground, causes, air, to, pile, up, this, frictional, convergence, creates, lift, and, enhances, snowfall, heavy, lake, effect, snowfalls, can, occur, when, cold, air, travels, 60, miles, 97, km, or, longer, over, a, large, unfrozen, lake, lake, effect, snow, makes, buffalo, and, erie, the, eleventh, and, thirteenth, snowiest, cities, in, the, entire, united, states, respectively, according, to, data, collected, from, the, national, climatic, data, center, since, winds, blow, primarily, west, to, east, along, the, main, axis, of, the, lake, lake, effect, snowstorms, are, more, pronounced, on, the, eastern, parts, of, the, lake, buffalo, typically, gets, 95, inches, 240, cm, of, snow, each, winter, and, sometimes, ten, feet, 3, 0, m, of, snow, the, snowiest, city, is, syracuse, new, york, which, can, receive, heavy, snowfall, from, both, the, lake, effect, process, and, large, coastal, cyclones, a, storm, around, christmas, in, 2001, pounded, buffalo, with, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, of, snow, the, effects, of, the, warmer, lake, water, is, reduced, when, the, lake, freezes, over, in, january, 2011, for, example, residents, of, cleveland, were, glad, when, lake, erie, was, 90, percent, frozen, since, it, meant, that, the, area, had, made, it, over, the, hump, in, terms, of, enduring, repeated, snowfalls, which, required, much, shoveling, being, the, shallowest, of, the, great, lakes, it, is, the, most, likely, to, freeze, and, frequently, does, in, contrast, lake, michigan, has, never, completely, frozen, over, since, the, warmer, and, deeper, portion, is, in, the, south, although, it, came, close, to, being, totally, frozen, during, three, harsh, winters, over, the, past, century, in, past, years, lake, ice, was, so, thick, that, it, was, possible, to, drive, over, it, or, go, sailing, on, iceboats, many, lake, residents, take, advantage, of, the, ice, and, travel, some, drive, to, canada, and, back, the, first, ice, usually, forms, in, late, november, and, by, january, it, locks, into, place, for, islanders, in, the, western, basin, it, is, the, equivalent, of, summer, vacation, once, the, lake, freezes, islanders, organize, impromptu, ice, rallies, families, gather, to, drink, hot, wine, and, race, all, terrain, vehicles, across, the, lake, they, also, race, iceboats, which, resemble, sailboats, on, skates, many, people, drive, to, other, islands, for, dinner, with, friends, they, ride, in, cars, with, the, roofs, and, doors, chopped, off, so, they, can, escape, if, the, vehicles, fall, through, the, ice, islanders, stab, evergreen, trees, into, the, ice, every, 50, yards, to, mark, a, route, even, in, the, coldest, winters, there, are, dangerous, patches, of, thin, ice, the, cracks, are, so, predictable, that, the, put, in, bay, ice, yacht, club, prints, them, on, a, map, on, a, normal, winter, day, the, ice, is, dotted, with, 2, 000, fishing, shanties, strong, winds, have, caused, lake, currents, to, shift, sediment, on, the, bottom, leading, to, shifting, sandbars, that, have, been, the, cause, of, shipwrecks, but, winds, can, have, a, peaceful, purpose, as, well, there, have, been, proposals, to, place, electricity, producing, wind, turbines, in, windy, and, shallow, points, in, the, lake, and, along, the, coast, steel, winds, a, former, steel, mill, site, in, buffalo, has, been, developed, as, an, urban, wind, farm, housing, 14, turbines, capable, of, generating, up, to, 35, megawatts, of, electricity, a, plan, by, samsung, to, build, an, offshore, wind, farm, on, the, north, shore, of, the, lake, from, port, maitland, to, nanticoke, for, a, distance, of, 15, 5, mi, 24, 9, km, has, been, met, with, opposition, from, residents, canadians, near, leamington, and, kingsville, have, organized, protest, groups, to, thwart, attempts, to, bring, wind, turbines, to, the, lake, reasons, against, the, turbines, include, spoiling, lake, views, plans, to, install, turbines, in, pigeon, bay, south, of, leamington, were, met, with, opposition, as, well, the, notion, that, bird, and, bat, migration, may, be, hurt, by, the, wind, turbines, has, been, used, to, argue, against, the, wind, turbines, as, well, the, lake, is, responsible, for, microclimates, that, are, important, to, agriculture, along, its, north, shore, is, one, of, the, richest, areas, of, canada, s, fruit, and, vegetable, production, this, southernmost, tip, particularly, in, the, area, around, leamington, is, known, as, canada, s, tomato, capital, the, area, around, port, rowan, has, special, trees, that, grow, because, of, the, tempering, effect, of, the, lake, and, species, include, tulip, trees, dogwood, sassafras, and, sour, gum, this, area, s, many, greenhouses, produce, a, variety, of, tropical, plants, rarely, cultivated, so, far, north, including, some, species, of, cacti, because, of, the, lake, s, tempering, effect, along, the, southeastern, shore, of, ohio, pennsylvania, and, new, york, is, an, important, grape, growing, region, as, are, the, islands, in, the, lake, apple, orchards, are, abundant, in, northeast, ohio, to, western, new, york, according, to, one, estimate, 34, to, 36, inches, 860, to, 910, mm, of, water, evaporate, each, year, from, the, surface, of, the, lake, which, allows, for, rainfall, and, other, precipitation, in, surrounding, areas, reports, are, conflicting, about, the, overall, effect, of, global, warming, on, the, great, lakes, region, including, lake, erie, one, account, suggests, that, climate, change, is, causing, greater, evaporation, of, lake, water, leading, to, warmer, temperatures, as, well, as, thinner, or, nonexistent, ice, in, winter, which, is, fueling, concerns, that, erie, appears, to, be, shrinking, and, is, the, most, likely, candidate, among, the, five, great, lakes, to, turn, into, a, festering, mud, puddle, in, 2010, the, windsor, star, reported, that, the, lake, experienced, record, breaking, water, temperatures, reaching, 81, f, 27, c, in, mid, august, and, compared, the, lake, to, a, bath, tub, lake, erie, has, a, complex, ecosystem, with, many, species, in, interaction, human, activity, such, as, pollution, and, maritime, ship, traffic, can, affect, this, environment, in, numerous, ways, the, interactions, between, new, species, can, sometimes, have, beneficial, effects, as, well, as, harmful, effects, some, introductions, have, been, seen, as, beneficial, such, as, the, introduction, of, pacific, salmon, occasionally, there, have, been, mass, die, offs, of, certain, species, of, fish, sometimes, for, reasons, unknown, such, as, many, numbers, of, rainbow, smelt, in, may, 2010, the, lake, has, been, plagued, with, a, number, of, invasive, species, including, zebra, and, quagga, mussels, the, goby, and, the, grass, carp, one, estimate, was, that, 180, invasive, species, are, in, the, great, lakes, some, having, traveled, in, ballast, water, in, international, ships, zebra, mussels, and, gobies, have, been, credited, with, the, increased, population, and, size, of, smallmouth, bass, in, lake, erie, in, 2008, concerns, arose, that, the, newest, invader, swarming, in, the, great, lakes, the, bloody, red, shrimp, might, harm, fish, populations, and, promote, algal, blooms, environmentalists, and, biologists, study, lake, conditions, via, installations, such, as, the, franz, theodore, stone, laboratory, on, gibraltar, island, the, lab, which, was, established, in, 1895, is, the, oldest, biological, field, station, in, the, united, states, stone, laboratory, was, donated, to, the, ohio, state, university, by, julius, stone, in, 1925, as, part, of, the, university, s, ohio, sea, grant, college, program, the, great, lakes, institute, of, the, university, of, windsor, has, experts, who, study, issues, such, as, lake, sediment, pollution, and, the, flow, of, contaminants, such, as, phosphorus, other, invasive, species, in, lake, erie, include, spiny, water, fleas, fishhook, water, fleas, sea, lamprey, and, white, perch, the, invasive, plant, species, in, lake, erie, consist, mainly, of, eurasian, milfoil, trapa, natans, and, purple, loosestrife, the, shore, of, the, lake, is, also, host, to, invasive, species, of, the, phragmites, reed, genus, an, ongoing, concern, is, that, nutrient, overloading, from, fertilizers, and, human, and, animal, waste, known, as, eutrophication, in, which, additional, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, enter, the, lake, will, cause, plant, life, to, run, wild, and, multiply, like, crazy, since, fewer, wetlands, remain, to, filter, nutrients, and, greater, channelization, of, waterways, nutrients, in, water, can, cause, algal, blooms, to, sprout, with, low, oxygen, dead, zones, in, a, complex, interaction, of, natural, forces, as, of, the, 2010s, much, of, the, phosphorus, in, the, lake, comes, from, fertilizer, applied, to, no, till, soybean, and, corn, fields, but, washed, into, streams, by, heavy, rains, the, algal, blooms, result, from, growth, of, microcystis, a, toxic, blue, green, alga, that, the, zebra, mussels, which, infest, the, lake, do, not, eat, periodically, a, dead, zone, or, region, of, low, oxygen, occurs, in, the, lake, the, location, of, which, varies, scientists, from, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, have, been, studying, the, lake, s, blue, green, algal, blooms, and, trying, to, find, ways, to, predict, when, they, are, spreading, or, where, they, might, make, landfall, typically, the, blooms, arrive, late, each, summer, this, problem, was, extreme, in, the, mid, and, late, 1960s, and, the, lake, erie, wastewater, management, study, conducted, by, the, buffalo, district, of, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, determined, that, the, eutrophication, was, caused, by, point, sources, such, as, industrial, outfalls, and, municipal, sanitary, and, storm, sewer, outfalls, as, well, as, diffuse, sources, such, as, overland, runoff, from, farm, and, forest, land, all, of, these, sources, contribute, nutrients, primarily, phosphorus, to, the, lake, growth, of, organisms, in, the, lake, is, then, spiked, to, the, point, that, oxygen, levels, are, depleted, recommendations, were, made, for, reducing, point, source, outflows, and, reducing, farm, contributions, of, phosphorus, by, changing, fertilizer, usage, employing, no, till, farming, and, other, conservative, practices, many, industrial, and, municipal, sources, have, since, been, greatly, reduced, the, improved, farming, practices, which, were, voluntary, were, followed, for, a, while, resulting, in, remarkable, recovery, of, the, lake, in, the, 1970s, the, conservation, practices, are, not, monitored, and, have, not, been, kept, up, one, recent, account, suggests, that, the, seasonal, algal, blooms, in, lake, erie, were, possibly, caused, by, runoff, from, cities, fertilizers, zebra, mussels, and, livestock, near, water, a, second, report, focuses, on, the, zebra, mussels, as, being, the, cause, of, dead, zones, since, they, filter, so, much, sediment, that, this, produces, an, overgrowth, of, algae, one, report, suggests, the, oxygen, poor, zone, began, about, 1993, in, the, lake, s, central, basin, and, becomes, more, pronounced, during, summer, but, is, somewhat, of, a, mystery, why, this, happens, some, scientists, speculate, that, the, dead, zone, is, a, naturally, occurring, phenomenon, another, report, cites, ohio, s, maumee, river, as, the, main, source, of, polluted, runoff, of, phosphorus, from, industries, municipalities, tributaries, and, agriculture, and, in, 2008, satellite, images, showed, the, algal, bloom, heading, toward, pelee, island, two, two, year, 2, million, studies, are, trying, to, understand, the, growing, zone, which, was, described, as, a, 10, foot, thick, layer, of, cold, water, at, the, bottom, 55, feet, 17, m, in, one, area, which, stretches, 100, miles, across, the, lake, s, center, it, kills, fish, and, microscopic, creatures, of, the, lake, s, food, chain, and, fouls, the, water, and, may, cause, further, problems, in, later, years, for, sport, and, commercial, fishing, algal, blooms, continued, in, early, 2013, but, new, farming, techniques, climate, change, and, even, a, change, in, lake, erie, s, ecosystem, make, phosphorus, pollution, more, intractable, blue, green, algae, cyanobacteria, bloom, were, problematic, in, august, 2019, according, to, a, news, report, in, august, scientists, fully, expect, to, overwhelm, much, of, western, lake, erie, again, this, summer, by, august, 12, 2019, the, bloom, extended, for, roughly, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, a, large, bloom, does, not, necessarily, mean, the, cyanobacteria, will, produce, toxins, said, michael, mckay, executive, director, of, the, great, lakes, institute, for, environmental, research, at, the, university, of, windsor, not, enough, is, being, done, to, stop, fertilizer, and, phosphorus, from, getting, into, the, lake, and, causing, blooms, he, added, water, testing, was, being, conducted, in, august, the, largest, lake, erie, blooms, to, date, occurred, in, 2015, exceeding, the, severity, index, at, 10, 5, and, in, 2011, at, a, 10, according, to, the, noaa, in, early, august, the, 2019, bloom, was, expected, to, measure, 7, 5, on, the, severity, index, but, could, range, between, 6, and, 9, at, that, time, satellite, images, depicted, a, bloom, stretching, up, to, 1, 300, square, kilometres, 500, sq, mi, on, lake, erie, with, the, epicenter, near, toledo, ohio, the, lake, erie, water, snake, a, subspecies, of, the, northern, water, snake, nerodia, sipedon, lives, in, the, vicinity, of, ohio, s, put, in, bay, harbor, and, had, been, placed, on, the, threatened, species, list, by, 2010, the, water, snake, population, was, over, 12, 000, snakes, while, they, have, a, nonvenomous, bite, they, are, a, key, predator, in, the, lake, s, aquatic, ecosystem, since, they, feed, on, mudpuppies, walleye, and, smallmouth, bass, the, snake, is, helpful, in, keeping, the, population, of, goby, fish, in, check, they, mate, from, late, may, through, early, june, and, can, be, found, in, large, mating, balls, with, one, female, bunched, within, several, males, in, 1999, a, local, tv, station, s, doppler, weather, radar, detected, millions, of, mayflies, heading, for, presque, isle, in, blue, and, green, splotches, on, the, radar, in, clouds, measuring, 10, mi, 16, km, long, these, insects, were, a, sign, of, lake, erie, s, move, back, to, health, since, the, mayflies, require, clean, water, to, thrive, biologist, masteller, of, pennsylvania, state, university, declared, the, insects, to, be, a, nice, nuisance, since, they, signified, the, lake, s, return, to, health, after, 40, years, of, absence, each, is, 1, 5, in, 38, mm, long, the, three, main, species, of, mayflies, are, ephemera, simulans, hexagenia, rigida, and, h, limbata, the, insects, mate, over, a, 72, hour, period, from, june, through, september, they, fly, in, masses, up, to, the, shore, mate, in, the, air, then, females, lay, up, to, 8, 000, eggs, each, over, the, water, the, eggs, sink, back, down, and, the, cycle, repeats, sometimes, the, clouds, of, mayflies, have, caused, power, outages, and, roads, to, become, slippery, with, squashed, insects, zebra, mussels, filtering, extra, nutrients, from, the, lake, allows, the, mayfly, larvae, to, thrive, incidents, of, birds, dying, from, botulism, have, occurred, in, 2000, and, in, 2002, birds, affected, included, grebes, common, and, red, breasted, mergansers, loons, diving, ducks, ring, billed, gulls, and, herring, gulls, one, account, suggests, that, bird, populations, are, in, trouble, notably, the, wood, warbler, which, had, population, declines, around, 60, in, 2008, possible, causes, for, declines, in, bird, populations, are, farming, practices, loss, of, habitats, soil, depletion, and, erosion, and, toxic, chemicals, in, 2006, concerns, arose, of, possible, avian, influenza, bird, flu, after, two, wild, swans, on, the, lake, were, found, diseased, but, they, did, not, contain, the, h5n1, virus, sightings, of, a, magnificent, frigatebird, a, tropical, bird, with, a, 2, m, wingspan, happened, over, the, lake, in, 2008, lake, erie, infamously, became, very, polluted, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, a, result, of, the, quantity, of, heavy, industry, situated, in, cities, on, its, shores, with, reports, of, bacteria, laden, beaches, and, fish, contaminated, by, industrial, waste, in, the, 1970s, patches, of, the, lake, were, declared, dead, because, of, industrial, waste, and, sewage, from, runoffs, as, the, new, york, times, reporter, denny, lee, wrote, in, 2004, the, lake, after, all, is, where, the, rust, belt, meets, the, water, incidents, occurred, of, the, oily, surfaces, of, tributary, rivers, emptying, into, lake, erie, catching, fire, in, 1969, cleveland, s, cuyahoga, river, erupted, in, flames, chronicled, in, a, time, magazine, article, which, lamented, a, tendency, to, use, rivers, flowing, through, major, cities, as, convenient, free, sewers, the, detroit, river, caught, fire, on, another, occasion, the, outlook, was, gloomy, each, day, detroit, cleveland, and, 120, other, municipalities, fill, erie,

conference, december, 18, 1970, referencing, new, pollution, control, litigation, with, particular, reference, to, work, with, the, environmental, protection, agency, and, announcing, the, filing, of, a, lawsuit, that, morning, against, the, jones, and, laughlin, steel, corporation, for, discharging, substantial, quantities, of, cyanide, into, the, cuyahoga, river, near, cleveland, jones, filed, the, misdemeanor, charges, in, district, court, alleging, violations, of, the, 1899, rivers, and, harbors, act, cleveland, s, director, of, public, utilities, ben, stefanski, pursued, a, massive, effort, to, scrub, the, cuyahoga, the, effort, cost, 100, million, in, bonds, according, to, one, estimate, new, sewer, lines, were, built, clevelanders, approved, a, bond, issue, by, 2, to, 1, to, upgrade, cleveland, s, sewage, system, federal, officials, acted, as, well, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, clean, water, act, of, 1972, and, the, united, states, and, canada, established, water, pollution, limits, in, an, international, water, quality, agreement, the, corps, lewms, was, also, instituted, at, that, time, the, clearing, of, the, water, column, is, partly, the, result, of, the, introduction, and, rapid, spread, of, zebra, mussels, from, europe, which, had, the, effect, of, covering, the, lake, bottom, with, each, creature, filtering, a, liter, of, fresh, water, each, day, helping, to, restore, the, lake, to, a, cleaner, state, the, 1972, great, lakes, water, quality, agreement, significantly, reduced, the, dumping, and, runoff, of, phosphorus, into, the, lake, the, lake, has, since, become, clean, enough, to, allow, sunlight, to, infiltrate, its, water, and, produce, algae, and, sea, weed, but, a, dead, zone, persists, there, have, been, instances, of, beach, closings, at, presque, isle, because, of, unexplained, e, coli, contaminations, possibly, caused, by, sewer, water, overflows, after, heavy, downpours, since, the, 1970s, environmental, regulation, has, led, to, a, great, increase, in, water, quality, and, the, return, of, economically, important, fish, species, such, as, walleye, and, other, biological, life, there, was, substantial, evidence, that, the, new, controls, had, substantially, reduced, levels, of, ddt, in, the, water, by, 1979, cleanup, efforts, were, described, in, 1979, as, a, notable, environmental, success, story, suggesting, that, the, cumulative, effect, of, legislation, studies, and, bans, had, reversed, the, effects, of, pollution, the, globs, of, oil, the, multicolored, industrial, discharges, the, flotsam, from, shoreline, cities, the, fecal, and, bacterial, wastes, are, no, longer, dumped, in, the, lakes, in, vast, quantities, joint, u, s, canadian, agreements, pushed, 600,

toward, cleaner, water, has, been, in, a, positive, direction, since, the, 1970s, there, was, a, tentative, exploratory, plan, to, capture, co, 2, compress, it, to, a, liquid, form, and, pump, it, a, half, mile, 800, m, beneath, lake, erie, s, surface, underneath, the, porous, rock, structure, according, to, chemical, engineer, peter, douglas, there, is, sufficient, storage, space, beneath, lake, erie, to, hold, between, 15, and, 50, years, of, liquid, co, 2, emissions, from, the, 4, 000, megawatt, nanticoke, coal, plant, but, there, has, been, no, substantial, progress, on, this, issue, since, 2007, lake, erie, is, home, to, one, of, the, world, s, largest, freshwater, commercial, fisheries, lake, erie, s, fish, populations, are, the, most, abundant, of, the, great, lakes, partially, because, of, the, lake, s, relatively, mild, temperatures, and, plentiful, supply, of, plankton, which, is, the, basic, building, block, of, the, food, chain, the, lake, s, fish, population, accounts, for, an, estimated, 50, of, all, fish, inhabiting, the, great, lakes, the, lake, contains, steelhead, walleye, known, in, canada, as, pickerel, largemouth, bass, smallmouth, bass, perch, lake, trout, king, salmon, whitefish, smelt, and, many, others, the, lake, consists, of, a, long, list, of, well, established, introduced, species, common, non, indigenous, fish, species, include, the, rainbow, smelt, alewife, white, perch, and, common, carp, non, native, sport, fish, such, as, rainbow, trout, and, brown, trout, are, stocked, specifically, for, anglers, to, catch, attempts, failed, to, stock, coho, salmon, and, its, numbers, are, dwindling, commercial, landings, are, dominated, by, yellow, perch, and, walleye, with, substantial, quantities, of, rainbow, smelt, and, white, bass, also, taken, anglers, target, walleye, and, yellow, perch, with, some, effort, directed, at, rainbow, trout, up, until, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, most, commonly, caught, commercial, fish, more, than, 50, of, the, commercial, catch, was, a, subspecies, of, the, walleye, known, as, the, blue, walleye, sander, vitreus, glaucus, sometimes, erroneously, called, blue, pike, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, as, pollution, in, the, lake, declined, counts, of, walleyes, which, were, caught, grew, from, 112, 000, in, 1975, to, 4, 1, million, in, 1985, with, estimates, of, the, numbers, of, walleyes, in, the, lake, at, around, 33, million, in, the, basin, with, many, of, 8, pounds, 3, 6, kg, or, more, not, all, walleyes, thrived, the, combination, of, overfishing, and, the, eutrophication, of, the, lake, by, pollution, caused, the, population, to, collapse, and, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, blue, walleye, was, declared, extinct, but, the, lake, erie, walleye, was, reportedly, having, record, numbers, even, in, 1989, according, to, one, report, there, have, been, concerns, about, rising, levels, of, mercury, in, walleye, fish, a, study, by, the, canadian, ministry, of, the, environment, noted, an, increasing, concentration, trend, but, that, concentrations, were, within, acceptable, limits, established, by, authorities, in, pennsylvania, because, of, the, threat, of, pcbs, it, was, recommended, that, persons, eat, no, more, than, one, walleye, meal, per, month, because, of, these, and, other, concerns, in, 1990, the, national, wildlife, federation, was, on, the, verge, of, having, a, negative, fish, consumption, advisory, for, walleye, and, smallmouth, bass, which, had, been, the, main, catch, of, an, 800, million, commercial, fishing, industry, the, longest, fish, in, lake, erie, is, reportedly, the, sturgeon, which, can, grow, to, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, long, and, weight, 300, pounds, 140, kg, but, it, is, an, endangered, species, and, mostly, lives, on, the, bottom, of, the, lake, in, 2009, there, was, a, confirmed, instance, of, a, sturgeon, being, caught, which, was, returned, to, the, lake, alive, and, there, are, hopes, that, the, population, of, sturgeons, is, resurging, estimates, vary, about, the, fishing, market, for, the, great, lakes, region, in, 2007, one, estimate, of, the, total, market, for, fishing, in, the, great, lakes, including, commercial, and, recreational, fishing, was, 4, billion, annually, another, estimate, was, more, than, 7, billion, but, since, high, levels, of, pollution, were, discovered, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, there, has, been, continued, debate, over, the, desired, intensity, of, commercial, fishing, commercial, fishing, in, lake, erie, has, been, hurt, by, pollution, as, well, as, government, regulations, which, limit, the, size, of, their, catch, one, report, suggested, that, the, numbers, of, fishing, boats, and, employees, had, declined, by, two, thirds, in, recent, decades, another, concern, had, been, that, pollution, in, the, lake, as, well, as, toxins, found, inside, fish, were, working, against, commercial, fishing, interests, u, s, fishermen, based, along, lake, erie, lost, their, livelihood, over, the, past, few, decades, and, no, longer, catch, fish, such, as, whitefish, for, markets, in, new, york, pennsylvania, had, a, special, 3, stamp, on, fishing, licenses, to, help, compensate, commercial, fishermen, for, their, losses, but, this, program, ended, after, five, years, one, blamed, the, commercial, fishing, ban, on, a, test, of, wills, between, commercial, and, recreational, fishermen, one, side, needed, large, hauls, the, other, feared, the, lake, was, being, emptied, commercial, fishing, is, now, predominantly, based, in, canadian, communities, with, a, much, smaller, fishery, largely, restricted, to, yellow, perch, in, ohio, the, ontario, fishery, is, one, of, the, most, intensively, managed, in, the, world, however, there, are, reports, that, some, canadian, commercial, fishermen, are, dissatisfied, with, fishing, quotas, and, have, sued, the, government, about, this, matter, and, there, have, been, complaints, that, the, legislative, body, writing, the, quotas, is, dominated, by, the, u, s, and, that, sport, fishing, interests, are, favored, at, the, expense, of, commercial, fishing, interests, cuts, of, 30, to, 45, percent, for, certain, fish, were, made, in, 2007, the, lake, erie, fishery, was, one, of, the, first, fisheries, in, the, world, managed, on, individual, transferable, quotas, and, features, mandatory, daily, catch, reporting, and, intensive, auditing, of, the, catch, reporting, system, still, the, commercial, fishery, is, the, target, of, critics, who, would, like, to, see, the, lake, managed, for, the, exclusive, benefit, of, sport, fishing, and, the, various, industries, serving, the, sport, fishery, according, to, one, report, the, canadian, town, of, port, dover, is, the, home, of, the, lake, s, largest, fishing, fleet, the, lake, can, be, thought, of, as, a, common, asset, with, multiple, purposes, including, being, a, fishery, there, was, direct, competition, between, commercial, fishermen, and, sport, fishermen, including, charter, boats, and, sales, of, fishing, licenses, throughout, the, lake, s, history, with, both, sides, seeking, government, assistance, from, either, washington,

commission, makes, assessments, using, sophisticated, mathematical, modeling, systems, the, commission, has, been, the, focus, of, considerable, recrimination, primarily, from, angler, and, charter, fishing, groups, in, the, u, s, which, have, had, a, historical, antipathy, to, commercial, fishing, interests, this, conflict, is, complex, dating, from, the, 1960s, and, earlier, with, the, result, in, the, united, states, that, in, 2011, commercial, fishing, was, mostly, eliminated, from, great, lakes, states, one, report, suggests, that, battling, between, diverse, fishing, interests, began, around, lake, michigan, and, evolved, to, cover, the, entire, great, lakes, region, the, analysis, suggests, that, in, the, lake, erie, context, the, competition, between, sport, and, commercial, fishing, involves, universals, and, that, these, conflicts, are, cultural, not, scientific, and, therefore, not, resolvable, by, reference, to, ecological, data, the, lake, supports, a, strong, sport, fishery, while, commercial, fishing, declined, sport, fishing, has, remained, the, deep, cool, waters, that, spawn, the, best, fishing, is, in, the, canadian, side, of, the, lake, as, a, result, a, fishing, boat, that, crosses, the, international, border, triggers, the, security, concerns, of, border, crossings, and, fishermen, are, advised, to, carry, their, passport, if, their, boat, crosses, the, invisible, border, line, in, the, lake, upon, returning, to, the, american, shore, passengers, need, to, report, to, a, local, border, protection, office, in, 2008, the, pennsylvania, fish, and, boat, commission, tried, stocking, the, lake, with, brown, trout, in, an, effort, to, build, what, s, called, a, put, grow, and, take, fishery, there, was, a, report, that, charter, boat, fishing, increased, substantially, on, the, american, side, from, 46, to, 638, charter, boats, in, operation, in, ohio, alone, during, a, period, from, 1975, to, 1985, as, pollution, levels, declined, and, after, populations, of, walleye, increased, substantially, in, the, lake, in, 1984, ohio, sold, 27, 000, nonresident, fishing, permits, and, sport, fishing, was, described, as, big, business, in, 1992, there, were, accounts, of, fishermen, regularly, catching, walleye, weighing, up, to, 12, pounds, 5, 4, kg, it, is, possible, to, fish, off, piers, in, winter, for, burbot, the, burbot, make, a, midwinter, spawning, run, and, is, reportedly, one, of, erie, s, glacial, relics, in, winter, when, the, lake, freezes, many, fishermen, go, out, on, the, ice, cut, holes, and, fish, it, is, even, possible, to, build, bonfires, on, the, ice, but, venturing, on, lake, erie, ice, can, be, dangerous, in, a, 2009, incident, warming, temperatures, winds, of, 35, miles, per, hour, 56, km, h, and,

rescued, by, helicopters, or, boats, the, day, began, with, fishermen, setting, down, wooden, pallets, to, create, a, bridge, over, a, crack, in, the, ice, so, they, could, roam, farther, out, on, the, lake, but, the, planks, fell, into, the, water, when, the, ice, shifted, stranding, the, fishermen, about, 1, 000, yards, offshore, when, fishermen, realized, late, saturday, morning, that, the, ice, had, broken, away, they, began, to, debate, the, best, way, off, some, chose, to, sit, and, wait, for, authorities, while, others, headed, east, in, search, of, an, ice, bridge, others, managed, to, get, to, land, on, their, own, by, riding, their, all, terrain, vehicles, about, five, miles, east, to, where, ice, hadn, t, broken, away, when, the, rescued, fishermen, made, it, to, shore,

dubbed, the, lake, erie, north, shore, or, lens, region, and, includes, pelee, island, and, since, it, is, farther, north, than, comparable, wine, growing, areas, in, the, world, the, length, of, the, days, in, the, summer, are, longer, a, longer, growing, season, because, of, the, lake, moderated, temperatures, make, the, risk, of, early, frosts, less, likely, the, drainage, basin, has, led, to,

400, to, 8, 000, according, to, one, estimate, of, which, about, 270, are, confirmed, shipwreck, locations, research, into, shipwrecks, has, been, organized, by, the, peachman, lake, erie, shipwreck, research, center, located, on, the, grounds, of, the, great, lakes, historical, society, most, wrecks, are, undiscovered, but, believed, to, be, well, preserved, and, at, most, 200, feet, 61, m, below, the, water, surface, one, report, suggests, there, are, more, wrecks, per, square, mile, than, any, other, freshwater, location, including, wrecks, from, indigenous, watercraft, there, are, efforts, to, identify, shipwreck, sites, and, survey, the, lake, floor, to, map, the, location, of, underwater, sites, possibly, for, further, study, or, exploration, while, the, lake, is, relatively,

wetsuit, one, estimate, is, that, lake, erie, has, a, quarter, of, all, 8, 000, estimated, shipwrecks, in, the, great, lakes, they, are, preserved, because, the, water, is, cold, and, salt, free, divers, have, a, policy, of, not, removing, or, touching, anything, at, the, wreck, the, cold, conditions, make, diving, difficult, requiring, divers, with, skill, and, experience, one, charter, firm, from, western, new, york, state, takes, about, 1, 500, divers, to, lake, erie, shipwrecks, in, a, typical, season, from, april, through, october, among, the, diving, community, they, are, considered,

account, suggests, 130, people, drowned, while, another, suggests, about, 20, drowned, there, was, speculation, that, the, sunken, vessel, had, been, a, gambling, ship, and, therefore, there, might, have, been, money, aboard, but, most, historians, were, skeptical, in, 1998, the, wreckage, of, adventure, became, the, first, shipwreck, registered, as, an, underwater, archaeological, site, when, it, was, discovered, that, adventure, s, propeller, had, been, removed, and, given, to, a, junkyard, the, propeller, was, reclaimed, days, before, being, converted, to, scrap, metal, and, brought, back, to, the, dive, site, in, 2003, divers, discovered, the, steamer, canobie, near, presque, isle, which, had, sunk, in, 1921, other, wrecks, include, the, fish, tub, neal, h, dow, 1910, the,
