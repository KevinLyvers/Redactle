burned, down, after, a, cooking, stove, fell, over, after, that, the, new, diesel, hut, was, built, in, the, summer, of, 2001, a, few, metres, below, its, ruins, so, called, because, it, is, located, at, the, site, of, the, former, diesel, generator, station, in, addition, there, is, accommodation, for, six, people, each, at, the, end, of, the, short, chairlift, above, the, second, cableway, section, painted, red, and, white, these, horizontal, steel, cylinders, called, barrels, russian, bochki, are, used, as, a, base, and, for, acclimatization, by, many, mountaineers, on, their, way, to,

nastiest, outhouse, which, is, close, to, being, the, highest, toilet, in, europe, at, 4, 200, m, 13, 800, ft, next, to, the, old, burnt, out, priyut, hut, the, title, was, conferred, by, outside, magazine, following, a, 1993, search, and, article, the, outhouse, is, surrounded, by, and, covered, in, ice, perched, on, the, end, of, a, rock, the, terskol, observatory, an, astronomical, observatory, with, the, iau, code, b18, is, located, 2, 5, km, north, west, of, terskol, village, at, an, altitude, of, 3, 090, metres, 10, 140, ft, three, ski, lifts, take, visitors, up, to, an, altitude, of, 3, 847, metres, until, the, mid, 2000s, the, first, section, was, provided, by, the, elbrouz, 1, cable, car, construction, of, which, began, in, 1959, starting, from, the, azaou, road, at, 2, 180, metres, above, sea, level, in, the, valley, it, leads, to, the, old, viewpoint, stari, krougozor, at, an, altitude, of, 2, 970, metres, at, the, foot, of, the, terminal, tongue, of, the, mali, glacier, azaou, which, has, retreated, since, the, construction, of, the, facility, its, length, is, 1, 740, metres, with, a, drop, of, 650, meters, the, second, section, built, in, 1976, leads, to, the, mir, station, at, an, altitude, of, 3, 470, metres, its, length, is, 1, 800, metres, with, a, drop, of, 500, metres, finally, the, last, stretch, is, a, chairlift, single, seater, which, then, makes, it, possible, to, avoid, an, hour, s, walk, for, hikers, to, the, garabachi, huts, at, an, altitude, of, 3, 847, metres, built, in, the, late, 1970s, it, is, 1, 000, metres, long, with, a, drop, of, 250, metres, in, december, 2006, the, first, section, of, the, cable, car, was, modernized, to, meet, safety, requirements, thanks, to, the, construction, of, a, new, cable, car, in, parallel, with, the, existing, one, in, august, 2009, a, new, cable, car, was, built, to, reach, the, second, section, on, 27, december, 2015, the, gondola, to, go, up, the, third, section, was, put, into, service, thus, becoming, the, second, highest, gondola, in, europe, after, that, of, zermatt, in, switzerland, which, is, 3, 883, m, high, its, capacity, is, 750, people, per, hour, the, ski, resort, is, busiest, in, april, and, may, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, routes, up, the, mountain, but, the, normal, route, which, is, free, of, crevasses, continues, more, or, less, straight, up, the, slope, from, the, end, of, the, cable, car, system, which, takes, passengers, up, to, 3, 800, metres, 12, 500, ft, during, the, summer, it, is, not, uncommon, for, 100, people, to, attempt, the, summit, via, this, route, each, day, winter, ascents, are, rare, and, are, usually, undertaken, only, by, very, experienced, climbers, elbrus, is, notorious, for, its, brutal, winter, weather, and, summit, attempts, are, few, and, far, between, the, climb, is, not, technically, difficult, but, it, is, physically, arduous, because, of, the, altitude, and, the, frequent, strong, winds, the, average, annual, death, toll, on, elbrus, is, 15, 30, primarily, due, to, many, unorganized, and, poorly, equipped, attempts, to, reach, the, mountain, s, summit, the, normal, route, on, the, southern, slope, is, the, easiest, the, safest, and, the, fastest, by, using, the, ski, lifts, to, the, garabachi, 36, refuges, offering, 11, cylindrical, cabins, the, barrels, of, 6, beds, each, and, a, total, of, 80, berths, with, water, from, the, melting, glacier, in, summer, and, electric, heating, at, an, hour, and, a, half, walk, at, an, altitude, of, 4, 157, metres, is, the, diesel, refuge, offering, 50, places, and, built, in, 2001, on, the, site, of, the, former, refuge, of, the, 11, accidentally, burned, down, on, aug, 16, 1998, after, an, additional, two, hours, of, walking, the, normal, route, passes, close, to, the, pastoukhov, rocks, which, can, be, reached, by, a, snowmobile, the, rest, of, the, ascent, to, the, two, main, peaks, can, only, be, done, on, foot, in, about, six, hours, the, route, is, well, signposted, but, it, can, be, risky, to, go, more, than, fifty, meters, from, it, because, of, the, few, crevasses, or, in, the, event, of, being, ill, equipped, a, variant, allows, you, to, reach, the, diesel, refuge, from, the, ice, camp, at, an, altitude, of, 3, 680, metres, another, route, leads, to, the, summit, from, kioukiourtliou, kolbachi, 4, 639, m, via, the, dome, of, koupol, at, 4, 912, meters, on, the, western, side, of, the, mountain, this, route, much, longer, is, accessible, either, from, the, first, section, of, the, cable, car, by, crossing, the, moraines, in, a, north, west, direction, via, the, khoti, outaou, pass, then, obliquely, towards, the, summit, or, from, the, khourzouk, valley, there, is, no, refuge, but, the, terrain, is, more, suitable, for, camping, other, routes, by, the, east, from, the, valley, the, glacier, and, the, iryk, pass, 3, 667, m, or, by, the, north, are, possible, but, are, more, hazardous, due, to, the, absence, or, obsolescence, of, the, installations, during, soviet, times, mount, elbrus, was, home, to, climbing, speed, competitions, and, was, training, for, national, himalayan, expeditions, 1982, and, 1989, the, best, mountaineers, tested, their, endurance, during, this, prestigious, event, in, september, 1987, vladimir, balyberdine, organized, the, first, official, race, between, the, refuge, and, the, pass, in, 1990, anatoli, boukreev, set, a, record, by, climbing, from, the, refuge, to, the, eastern, summit, in, a, time, of, 1, hour, and, 47, minutes, in, 2005, with, the, growing, enthusiasm, for, extreme, sports, and, the, increase, in, the, number, of, mountaineers, in, russia, this, tradition, was, relaunched, and, a, new, race, was, organized, between, bochki, and, the, western, summit, in, 2006, the, best, mountaineers, from, the, former, soviet, republics, participated, in, the, competition, denis, urubko, from, kazakhstan, sergei, seliverstov, and, alexander, kerimov, from, kyrgyzstan, and, sergei, sourmonin, from, russia, for, the, first, time, one, of, the, routes, offers, a, height, difference, of, over, 3, 000, metres, starting, at,
