newly, independent, country, of, mexico, which, shortly, after, independence, became, a, republic, the, missions, which, controlled, most, of, the, best, land, in, the, state, were, secularized, by, 1834, and, became, the, property, of, the, mexican, government, the, governor, granted, many, square, leagues, of, land, to, others, with, political, influence, these, huge, ranchos, or, cattle,

began, to, arrive, in, northern, california, these, new, arrivals, used, the, siskiyou, trail, california, trail, oregon, trail, and, old, spanish, trail, to, cross, the, rugged, mountains, and, harsh, deserts, in, and, surrounding, california, the, early, government, of, the, newly, independent, mexico, was, highly, unstable, and, in, a, reflection, of, this, from, 1831, onwards, california, also, experienced, a, series, of, armed, disputes, both, internal, and, with, the, central, mexican, government, during, this, tumultuous, political, period, juan, bautista, alvarado, was, able, to, secure, the, governorship, during, 1836, 1842, the, military, action, which, first, brought, alvarado, to, power, had, momentarily, declared, california, to, be, an, independent, state, and, had, been, aided, by, anglo, american, residents, of, california, including, isaac, graham, in, 1840, one, hundred, of, those, residents, who, did, not, have, passports, were, arrested, leading, to, the, graham, affair, which, was, resolved, in, part, with, the, intercession, of, royal, navy, officials, one, of, the, largest, ranchers, in, california, was, john, marsh, after, failing, to, obtain, justice, against, squatters, on, his, land, from, the, mexican, courts, he, determined, that, california, should, become, part, of, the, united, states, marsh, conducted, a, letter, writing, campaign, espousing, the, california, climate, the, soil, and, other, reasons, to, settle, there, as, well, as, the, best, route, to, follow, which, became, known, as, marsh, s, route, his, letters, were, read, reread, passed, around, and, printed, in, newspapers, throughout, the, country, and, started, the, first, wagon, trains, rolling, to, california, after, ushering, in, the, period, of, organized, emigration, to, california, marsh, became, involved, in, a, military, battle, between, the, much, hated, mexican, general, manuel, micheltorena, and, the, california, governor, he, had, replaced, juan, bautista, alvarado, at, the, battle, of, providencia, near, los, angeles, he, convinced, each, side, that, they, had, no, reason, to, be, fighting, each, other, as, a, result, of, marsh, s, actions, they, abandoned, the, fight, micheltorena, was, defeated, and, california, born, pio, pico, was, returned, to, the, governorship, this, paved, the, way, to, california, s, ultimate, acquisition, by, the, united, states, in, 1846, a, group, of, american, settlers, in, and, around, sonoma, rebelled, against, mexican, rule, during, the, bear, flag, revolt, afterward, rebels, raised, the, bear, flag, featuring, a, bear, a, star, a, red, stripe, and, the, words, california, republic, at, sonoma, the, republic, s, only, president, was, william, b, ide, who, played, a, pivotal, role, during, the, bear, flag, revolt, this, revolt, by, american, settlers, served, as, a, prelude, to, the, later, american, military, invasion, of, california, and, was, closely, coordinated, with, nearby, american, military, commanders, the, california, republic, was, short, lived, the, same, year, marked, the, outbreak, of, the, mexican, american, war, 1846, 1848, commodore, john, d, sloat, of, the, united, states, navy, sailed, into, monterey, bay, in, 1846, and, began, the, u, s, military, invasion, of, california, with, northern, california, capitulating, in, less, than, a, month, to, the, united, states, forces, in, southern, california, californios, continued, to, resist, american, forces, notable, military, engagements, of, the, conquest, include, the, battle, of, san, pasqual, and, the, battle, of, dominguez, rancho, in, southern, california, as, well, as, the, battle, of, ol, mpali, and, the, battle, of, santa, clara, in, northern, california, after, a, series, of, defensive, battles, in, the, south, the, treaty, of, cahuenga, was, signed, by, the, californios, on, january, 13, 1847, securing, a, censure, and, establishing, de, facto, american, control, in, california, following, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, february, 2, 1848, that, ended, the, war, the, westernmost, portion, of, the, annexed, mexican, territory, of, alta, california, soon, became, the, american, state, of, california, and, the, remainder, of, the, old, territory, was, then, subdivided, into, the, new, american, territories, of, arizona, nevada, colorado, and, utah, the, even, more, lightly, populated, and, arid, lower, region, of, old, baja, california, remained, as, a, part, of, mexico, in, 1846, the, total, settler, population, of, the, western, part, of, the, old, alta, california, had, been, estimated, to, be, no, more, than, 8, 000, plus, about, 100, 000, native, americans, down, from, about, 300, 000, before, hispanic, settlement, in, 1769, in, 1848, only, one, week, before, the, official, american, annexation, of, the, area, gold, was, discovered, in, california, this, being, an, event, which, was, to, forever, alter, both, the, state, s, demographics, and, its, finances, soon, afterward, a, massive, influx, of, immigration, into, the, area, resulted, as, prospectors, and, miners, arrived, by, the, thousands, the, population, burgeoned, with, united, states, citizens, europeans, middle, easterns, chinese, and, other, immigrants, during, the, great, california, gold, rush, by, the, time, of, california, s, application, for, statehood, in, 1850, the, settler, population, of, california, had, multiplied, to, 100, 000, by, 1854, more, than, 300, 000, settlers, had, come, between, 1847, and, 1870, the, population, of, san, francisco, increased, from, 500, to, 150, 000, the, seat, of, government, for, california, under, spanish, and, later, mexican, rule, had, been, located, in, monterey, from, 1777, until, 1845, pio, pico, the, last, mexican, governor, of, alta, california, had, briefly, moved, the, capital, to, los, angeles, in, 1845, the, united, states, consulate, had, also, been, located, in, monterey, under, consul, thomas, o, larkin, in, 1849, a, state, constitutional, convention, was, first, held, in, monterey, among, the, first, tasks, of, the, convention, was, a, decision, on, a, location, for, the, new, state, capital, the, first, full, legislative, sessions, were, held, in, san, jose, 1850, 1851, subsequent, locations, included, vallejo, 1852, 1853, and, nearby, benicia, 1853, 1854, these, locations, eventually, proved, to, be, inadequate, as, well, the, capital, has, been, located, in, sacramento, since, 1854, with, only, a, short, break, in, 1862, when, legislative, sessions, were, held, in, san, francisco, due, to, flooding, in, sacramento, once, the, state, s, constitutional, convention, had, finalized, its, state, constitution, it, applied, to, the, u, s, congress, for, admission, to, statehood, on, september, 9, 1850, as, part, of, the, compromise, of, 1850, california, became, a, free, state, and, september, 9, a, state, holiday, during, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, california, sent, gold, shipments, eastward, to, washington, in, support, of, the, union, however, due, to, the, existence, of, a, large, contingent, of, pro, south, sympathizers, within, the, state, the, state, was, not, able, to, muster, any, full, military, regiments, to, send, eastwards, to, officially, serve, in, the, union, war, effort, still, several, smaller, military, units, within, the, union, army, such, as, the, california, 100, company, were, unofficially, associated, with, the, state, of, california, due, to, a, majority, of, their, members, being, from, california, at, the, time, of, california, s, admission, into, the, union, travel, between, california, and, the, rest, of, the, continental, united, states, had, been, a, time, consuming, and, dangerous, feat, nineteen, years, later, and, seven, years, after, it, was, greenlighted, by, president, lincoln, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, was, completed, in, 1869, california, was, then, reachable, from, the, eastern, states, in, a, week, s, time, much, of, the, state, was, extremely, well, suited, to, fruit, cultivation, and, agriculture, in, general, vast, expanses, of, wheat, other, cereal, crops, vegetable, crops, cotton, and, nut, and, fruit, trees, were, grown, including, oranges, in, southern, california, and, the, foundation, was, laid, for, the, state, s, prodigious, agricultural, production, in, the, central, valley, and, elsewhere, in, the, nineteenth, century, a, large, number, of, migrants, from, china, traveled, to, the, state, as, part, of, the, gold, rush, or, to, seek, work, even, though, the, chinese, proved, indispensable, in, building, the, transcontinental, railroad, from, california, to, utah, perceived, job, competition, with, the, chinese, led, to, anti, chinese, riots, in, the, state, and, eventually, the, us, ended, migration, from, china, partially, as, a, response, to, pressure, from, california, with, the, 1882, chinese, exclusion, act, under, earlier, spanish, and, mexican, rule, california, s, original, native, population, had, precipitously, declined, above, all, from, eurasian, diseases, to, which, the, indigenous, people, of, california, had, not, yet, developed, a, natural, immunity, under, its, new, american, administration, california, s, first, governor, peter, hardeman, burnett, instituted, policies, that, have, been, described, as, a, state, sanctioned, policy, of, elimination, toward, california, s, indigenous, people, burnett, announced, in, 1851, in, his, second, annual, message, to, the, legislature, that, a, war, of, extermination, will, continue, to, be, waged, between, the, races, until, the, indian, race, becomes, extinct, must, be, expected, while, we, cannot, anticipate, the, result, with, but, painful, regret, the, inevitable, destiny, of, the, race, is, beyond, the, power, and, wisdom, of, man, to, avert, as, in, other, american, states, indigenous, peoples, were, forcibly, removed, from, their, lands, by, american, settlers, like, miners, ranchers, and, farmers, although, california, had, entered, the, american, union, as, a, free, state, the, loitering, or, orphaned, indians, were, de, facto, enslaved, by, their, new, anglo, american, masters, under, the, 1850, act, for, the, government, and, protection, of, indians, one, of, these, de, facto, slave, auctions, was, approved, by, the, los, angeles, city, council, and, occurred, for, nearly, twenty, years, there, were, many, massacres, in, which, hundreds, of, indigenous, people, were, killed, by, settlers, for, their, land, between, 1850, and, 1860, the, california, state, government, paid, around, 1, 5, million, dollars, some, 250, 000, of, which, was, reimbursed, by, the, federal, government, to, hire, militias, with, the, stated, purpose, of, protecting, settlers, however, these, militias, perpetrated, numerous, massacres, of, indigenous, people, indigenous, people, were, also, forcibly, moved, to, reservations, and, rancherias, which, were, often, small, and, isolated, and, without, enough, natural, resources, or, funding, from, the, government, to, adequately, sustain, the, populations, living, on, them, as, a, result, settler, colonialism, was, a, calamity, for, indigenous, people, several, scholars, and, native, american, activists, including, benjamin, madley, and, ed, castillo, have, described, the, actions, of, the, california, government, as, a, genocide, as, well, as, the, 40th, governor, of, california, gavin, newsom, benjamin, madley, estimates, that, from, 1846, to, 1873, between, 9, 492, and, 16, 092, indigenous, people, were, killed, including, between, 1, 680, and, 3, 741, killed, by, the, u, s, army, in, the, 20th, century, thousands, of, japanese, people, migrated, to,

route, 66, from, 1900, to, 1965, the, population, grew, from, fewer, than, one, million, to, the, greatest, in, the, union, in, 1940, the, census, bureau, reported, california, s, population, as, 6,
