cook, strait, m, ori, te, moana, o, raukawa, lit, the, sea, of, raukawa, is, a, strait, that, separates, north, island, from, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, the, strait, connects, the, tasman, sea, on, the, northwest, with, the, south, pacific, ocean, on, the, southeast, it, is, 22, kilometres, 14, mi, wide, at, its, narrowest, point, and, is, considered, one, of, the, most, dangerous, and, unpredictable, waters, in, the, world, regular, ferry, services, run, across, the, strait, between, picton, in, the, marlborough, sounds, and, wellington, the, strait, is, named, after, james, cook, the, first, european, commander, to, sail, through, it, in, 1770, in, m, ori, it, is, named, te, moana, o, raukawa, which, means, the, sea, of, raukawa, raukaua, is, a, type, of, woody, shrub, native, to, new, zealand, the, waters, of, cook, strait, are, dominated, by, strong, tidal, flows, the, tidal, flow, through, cook, strait, is, unusual, in, that, the, tidal, elevation, at, the, ends, of, the, strait, are, almost, exactly, out, of, phase, with, one, another, so, high, water, on, one, side, meets, low, water, on, the, other, approximately, 18, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, when, sea, levels, were, over, 100, metres, 330, feet, lower, than, present, day, levels, cook, strait, was, a, deep, harbour, of, the, pacific, ocean, disconnected, from, the, tasman, sea, by, the, vast, coastal, plains, which, formed, at, the, south, taranaki, bight, which, connected, the, north, and, south, islands, sea, levels, began, to, rise, 7, 000, years, ago, eventually, separating, the, islands, and, linking, cook, strait, to, the, tasman, sea, in, m, ori, legend, cook, strait, was, discovered, by, kupe, the, navigator, kupe, followed, in, his, canoe, a, monstrous, octopus, called, te, wheke, a, muturangi, across, cook, strait, and, destroyed, it, in, tory, channel, or, at, p, tea, when, dutch, explorer, abel, tasman, first, saw, new, zealand, in, 1642, he, thought, cook, strait, was, a, bight, closed, to, the, east, he, named, it, zeehaen, s, bight, after, the, zeehaen, one, of, the, two, ships, in, his, expedition, in, 1769, james, cook, established, that, it, was, a, strait, which, formed, a, navigable, waterway, cook, strait, attracted, european, settlers, in, the, early, 19th, century, because, of, its, use, as, a, whale, migration, route, whalers, established, bases, in, the, marlborough, sounds, and, in, the, k, piti, area, from, the, late, 1820s, until, the, mid, 1960s, arapaoa, island, was, a, base, for, whaling, in, the, sounds, perano, head, on, the, east, coast, of, the, island, was, the, principal, whaling, station, for, the, area, the, houses, built, by, the, perano, family, are, now, operated, as, tourist, accommodation, during, the, 1820s, te, rauparaha, led, a, m, ori, migration, to, and, the, conquest, and, settlement, of, the, cook, strait, region, from, 1840, more, permanent, settlements, sprang, up, first, at, wellington, then, at, nelson, and, at, whanganui, petre, at, this, period, the, settlers, saw, cook, strait, in, a, broader, sense, than, today, s, ferry, oriented, new, zealanders, for, them, the, strait, stretched, from, taranaki, to, cape, campbell, so, these, early, towns, all, clustered, around, cook, strait, or, cook, s, strait, in, the, pre, geographic, board, usage, of, the, times, as, the, central, feature, and, central, waterway, of, the, new, colony, in, 1866, the, first, telegraph, cable, was, laid, in, cook, strait, connecting, the, south, island, telegraph, system, to, wellington, between, 1888, and, 1912, a, risso, s, dolphin, named, pelorus, jack, became, famous, for, meeting, and, escorting, ships, around, cook, strait, pelorus, jack, was, usually, spotted, in, admiralty, bay, between, cape, francis, and, collinet, point, near, french, pass, a, channel, used, by, ships, travelling, between, wellington, and, nelson, pelorus, jack, is, also, remembered, after, he, was, the, subject, of, a, failed, assassination, attempt, he, was, later, protected, by, a, 1904, new, zealand, law, at, times, when, new, zealand, feared, invasion, various, coastal, fortifications, were, constructed, to, defend, cook, strait, during, the, second, world, war, two, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, gun, installations, were, constructed, on, wrights, hill, behind, wellington, these, guns, could, range, 28, kilometres, 17, mi, across, cook, strait, in, addition, thirteen, 15, cm, 6, in, gun, installations, were, constructed, around, wellington, along, the, m, kara, coast, and, at, entrances, to, the, marlborough, sounds, the, remains, of, most, of, these, fortifications, can, still, be, seen, the, pencarrow, head, lighthouse, was, the, first, permanent, lighthouse, built, in, new, zealand, its, first, keeper, mary, jane, bennett, was, the, only, female, lighthouse, keeper, in, new, zealand, s, history, the, light, was, decommissioned, in, 1935, when, it, was, replaced, by, the, baring, head, lighthouse, a, number, of, ships, have, been, wrecked, with, significant, loss, of, life, such, as, the, maria, in, 1851, the, city, of, dunedin, in, 1865, the, st, vincent, in, 1869, the, lastingham, in, 1884, ss, penguin, in, 1909, and, tev, wahine, in, 1968, the, strait, runs, in, a, general, nw, se, direction, with, the, south, island, on, the, west, side, and, north, island, on, the, east, at, its, narrowest, point, 22, kilometres, 14, mi, separate, cape, terawhiti, in, the, north, island, from, perano, head, on, arapaoa, island, in, the, marlborough, sounds, perano, head, is, actually, further, north, than, cape, terawhiti, in, good, weather, one, can, see, clearly, across, the, strait, the, west, south, island, coast, runs, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, along, cloudy, bay, and, past, the, islands, and, entrances, to, the, marlborough, sounds, the, east, north, island, coast, runs, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, along, palliser, bay, crosses, the, entrance, to, wellington, harbour, past, some, wellington, suburbs, and, continues, another, 15, kilometres, 9, 3, mi, to, m, kara, beach, the, brothers, is, a, group, of, tiny, islands, in, cook, strait, off, the, east, coast, of, arapaoa, island, north, brother, island, in, this, small, chain, is, a, sanctuary, for, the, rare, brothers, island, tuatara, while, the, largest, of, the, islands, is, the, site, of, the, brothers, island, lighthouse, the, shores, of, cook, strait, on, both, sides, are, mostly, composed, of, steep, cliffs, the, beaches, of, cloudy, bay, clifford, bay, and, palliser, bay, shoal, gently, down, to, 140, metres, 460, ft, where, there, is, a, more, or, less, extensive, submarine, plateau, the, rest, of, the, bottom, topography, is, complex, to, the, east, is, the, cook, strait, canyon, with, steep, walls, descending, eastwards, into, the, bathyal, depths, of, the, hikurangi, trough, to, the, north, west, lies, the, narrows, basin, where, water, is, 300, and, 400, metres, 980, and, 1, 310, ft, deep, fisherman, s, rock, in, the, north, end, of, the, narrows, basin, rises, to, within, a, few, metres, of, low, tide, and, is, marked, by, waves, breaking, in, rough, weather, a, relatively, shallow, submarine, valley, lies, across, the, northern, end, of, the, marlborough, sounds, the, bottom, topography, is, particularly, irregular, around, the, coast, of, the, south, island, where, the, presence, of, islands, underwater, rocks, and, the, entrances, to, the, sounds, create, violent, eddies, the, strait, has, an, average, depth, of, 128, metres, 420, ft, the, waters, of, cook, strait, are, dominated, by, strong, tidal, flows, the, tidal, flow, through, cook, strait, is, unusual, in, that, the, tidal, elevation, at, the, ends, of, the, strait, are, almost, exactly, out, of, phase, with, one, another, so, high, water, on, one, side, meets, low, water, on, the, other, this, is, because, the, main, m2, lunar, tide, component, that, happens, about, twice, per, day, actually, 12, 42, hours, circulates, anti, clockwise, around, new, zealand, and, is, out, of, phase, at, each, end, of, the, strait, see, animation, on, the, right, on, the, pacific, ocean, side, the, high, tide, occurs, five, hours, before, it, occurs, at, the, tasman, sea, side, on, one, side, is, high, tide, and, on, the, other, is, low, tide, the, difference, in, sea, level, can, drive, tidal, currents, up, to, 2, 5, metres, per, second, 5, knots, across, cook, strait, there, are, numerous, computer, models, of, the, tidal, flow, through, cook, strait, while, the, tidal, components, are, readily, realizable, the, residual, flow, is, more, difficult, to, model, probably, the, most, prolific, oceanographer, to, research, the, strait, was, ron, heath, based, at, the, n, z, oceanographic, institute, he, produced, a, number, of, studies, including, analysis, of, tides, which, identified, the, presence, of, a, virtual, amphidrome, in, the, region, heath, also, quantified, a, best, estimate, for, the, time, of, the, residual, current, i, e, net, current, after, averaging, out, the, tidal, influence, in, the, strait, this, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, research, with, computer, simulations, combining, with, large, datasets, to, refine, the, estimate, despite, the, strong, currents, there, is, almost, zero, tidal, height, change, in, the, centre, of, the, strait, instead, of, the, tidal, surge, flowing, in, one, direction, for, six, hours, and, then, in, the, reverse, direction, for, six, hours, a, particular, surge, might, last, eight, or, ten, hours, with, the, reverse, surge, enfeebled, in, especially, boisterous, weather, conditions, the, reverse, surge, can, be, negated, and, the, flow, can, remain, in, the, same, direction, through, three, surge, periods, and, longer, this, is, indicated, on, marine, charts, for, the, region, furthermore, the, submarine, ridges, running, off, from, the, coast, complicate, the, ocean, flow, and, turbulence, the, substantial, levels, of, turbulence, have, been, compared, to, that, observed, in, the, straits, of, gibraltar, and, seymour, narrows, in, british, columbia, the, electrical, power, generated, by, tidal, marine, turbines, varies, as, the, cube, of, the, tidal, speed, because, the, tidal, speed, doubles, eight, times, more, tidal, power, is, produced, during, spring, tides, than, at, neaps, cook, strait, has, been, identified, as, a, potentially, excellent, source, of, tidal, energy, in, april, 2008, neptune, power, was, granted, a, resource, consent, to, install, a, 10, million, experimental, underwater, tidal, stream, turbine, capable, of, producing, one, megawatt, the, turbine, was, designed, in, britain, and, was, to, be, built, in, new, zealand, and, placed, in, 80, metres, 260, ft, of, water, 4, 5, kilometres, 2, 8, mi, due, south, of, sinclair, head, in, waters, known, as, the, karori, rip, the, company, claimed, there, is, enough, tidal, movement, in, cook, strait, to, generate, 12, gw, of, power, more, than, one, and, a, half, times, new, zealand, s, current, requirements, in, practice, only, some, of, this, energy, could, be, harnessed, as, of, october, 2016, this, turbine, had, not, been, built, and, the, neptune, power, website, is, a, placeholder, with, no, further, announcements, on, the, other, side, of, the, strait, energy, pacifica, applied, for, resource, consent, to, install, up, to, 10, marine, turbines, each, able, to, produce, up, to, 1, 2, mw, near, the, cook, strait, entrance, to, tory, channel, the, company, claimed, that, tory, channel, was, an, optimal, site, with, a, tidal, current, speed, of, 3, 6, metres, per, second, 12, ft, s, and, the, best, combination, of, bathymetry, and, accessibility, to, the, electricity, network, however, despite, being, validated, by, computer, modelling, no, project, was, forthcoming, electric, power, and, communication, cables, link, the, north, and, south, islands, across, cook, strait, operated, by, transpower, three, submarine, power, cables, cross, cook, strait, between, oteranga, bay, in, the, north, island, and, fighting, bay, in, the, south, island, as, part, of, the, hvdc, inter, island, which, provides, an, electricity, link, between, benmore, in, the, south, island, and, haywards, in, the, north, island, each, cable, operates, at, 350, kv, and, can, carry, up, to, 500, mw, with, pole, 2, of, the, link, using, one, cable, and, pole, 3, using, two, cables, the, link, s, total, capacity, is, 1200, mw, 500mw, for, pole, 2, and, 700mw, for, pole, 3, the, cables, are, laid, on, the, seabed, within, a, legally, defined, zone, called, the, cable, protection, zone, cpz, the, cpz, is, about, 7, kilometres, 4, mi, wide, for, most, of, its, length, narrowing, where, it, nears, the, terminals, on, each, shore, fishing, activities, and, anchoring, boats, are, prohibited, within, the, cpz, fibre, optic, cables, carry, telecommunications, across, cook, strait, used, by, new, zealand, s, main, telecommunication, companies, for, domestic, and, commercial, traffic, and, by, transpower, for, control, of, the, hvdc, link, cook, strait, is, an, important, habitat, for, many, cetacean, species, several, dolphins, bottlenose, common, dusky, frequent, the, area, along, with, killer, whales, and, the, endemic, hector, s, dolphins, long, finned, pilot, whales, often, strand, en, masse, at, golden, bay, the, famous, pelorus, jack, was, a, risso, s, dolphin, being, observed, escorting, the, ships, between, 1888, and, 1912, though, this, species, is, not, a, common, visitor, to, the, new, zealand, s, waters, large, migratory, whales, attracted, many, whalers, to, the, area, in, the, winter, currently, an, annual, survey, of, counting, humpback, whales, is, taken, by, department, of, conservation, and, former, whalers, help, doc, to, spot, animals, by, using, several, vantage, points, along, the, strait, such, as, on, stephens, island, other, occasional, visitors, include, southern, right, whales, blue, whales, sei, whales, and, sperm, whales, giant, squid, specimens, have, been, washed, ashore, around, cook, strait, or, found, in, the, stomachs, of, sperm, whales, off, kaik, ura, a, colony, of, male, fur, seals, has, long, been, established, near, pariwhero, red, rocks, on, the, south, wellington, coast, cook, strait, offers, good, game, fishing, albacore, tuna, can, be, caught, from, january, to, may, broadbill, swordfish, bluenose, mako, sharks, and, the, occasional, marlin, and, white, shark, can, also, be, caught, regular, ferry, services, run, between, picton, in, the, marlborough, sounds, and, wellington, operated, by, kiwirail, the, interislander, and, straitnz, bluebridge, both, companies, run, services, several, times, a, day, roughly, half, the, crossing, is, in, the, strait, and, the, remainder, within, the, sounds, the, journey, covers, 70, kilometres, 43, mi, and, takes, about, three, hours, the, strait, often, experiences, rough, water, and, heavy, swells, from, strong, winds, especially, from, the, south, new, zealand, s, position, directly, athwart, the, roaring, forties, means, that, the, strait, funnels, westerly, winds, and, deflects, them, into, northerlies, as, a, result, ferry, sailings, are, often, disrupted, and, cook, strait, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, dangerous, and, unpredictable, waters, in, the, world, in, 1968, the, tev, wahine, a, wellington, lyttelton, ferry, of, the, union, company, foundered, at, the, entrance, to, wellington, harbour, and, capsized, of, the, 610, passengers, and, 123, crew, on, board, 53, died, in, 2006, 14, metre, 46, ft, waves, resulted, in, the, interislander, ferry, dev, aratere, slewing, violently, and, heeling, to, 50, degrees, three, passengers, and, a, crew, member, were, injured, five, rail, wagons, were, toppled, and, many, trucks, and, cars, were, heavily, damaged, maritime, nz, s, expert, witness, gordon, wood, claimed, that, if, the, ferry, had, capsized, most, passengers, and, crew, would, have, been, trapped, inside, and, would, have, had, no, warning, or, time, to, put, on, lifejackets, air, lines, which, operate, or, have, operated, flights, across, cook, strait, include, straits, air, freight, express, air2there, cityjet, and, sounds, air, according, to, oral, tradition, the, first, woman, to, swim, cook, strait, was, hine, poupou, she, swam, from, kapiti, island, to, d, urville, island, with, the, help, of, a, dolphin, other, m, ori, accounts, tell, of, at, least, one, swimmer, who, crossed, the, strait, in, 1831, in, modern, times, the, strait, was, swum, by, barrie, devenport, in, 1962, lynne, cox, was, the, first, woman, to, swim, it, in, 1975, the, most, prolific, swimmer, of, the, strait, is, philip, rush, who, has, crossed, eight, times, including, two, double, crossings, aditya, raut, was, the, youngest, swimmer, at, 11, years, caitlin, o, reilly, was, the, youngest, female, swimmer, and, youngest, new, zealander, at, 12, years, pam, dickson, was, the, oldest, swimmer, at, 55, years, john, coutts, was, the, first, person, to, swim, the, strait, in, both, directions, by, 2010, 74, single, crossings, had, been, made, by, 65, individuals, and, three, double, crossings, had, been, made, by, two, individuals, philip, rush, and, meda, mckenzie, in, march, 2016, marilyn, korzekwa, became, the, first, canadian, and, oldest, woman, at, 58, years, old, to, swim, the, strait, crossing, times, by, swimmers, are, largely, determined, by, the, strong, and, sometimes, unpredictable, currents, that, operate, in, the, strait, in, 1980, the, oceanographer, ron, heath, published, an, analysis, of, currents, in, cook, strait, using, the, tracks, of, swimmers, this, was, from, a, time, when, detailed, measurement, of, ocean, currents, was, technologically, difficult
