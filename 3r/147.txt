the, irrawaddy, river, burmese, pronounced, official, romanisation, ayeyarwady, is, the, largest, river, in, myanmar, originating, from, the, confluence, of, the, n, mai, and, mali, rivers, it, flows, from, north, to, south, before, emptying, through, the, irrawaddy, delta, in, the, ayeyarwady, region, into, the, andaman, sea, its, drainage, basin, of, about, 404, 000, square, kilometres, 156, 000, sq, mi, covers, 61, of, the, land, area, of, burma, and, contains, five, of, its, largest, cities, as, early, as, the, sixth, century, the, river, was, used, for, trade, and, transport, and, an, extensive, network, of, irrigation, canals, was, developed, to, support, agriculture, the, river, is, still, of, great, importance, as, the, largest, commercial, waterway, of, myanmar, it, also, provides, important, ecosystem, services, to, different, communities, and, economic, sectors, including, agriculture, fisheries, and, tourism, in, 2007, myanmar, s, military, dictatorship, signed, an, agreement, for, the, construction, of, seven, hydroelectric, dams, yielding, a, total, of, 13, 360, mw, in, the, n, mai, and, mali, rivers, including, the, 3600, mw, myitsone, dam, at, the, confluence, of, both, rivers, environmental, organisations, have, raised, concerns, about, the, project, s, ecological, impact, on, the, river, s, biodiverse, ecosystems, animals, potentially, impacted, include, the, endangered, irrawaddy, dolphin, and, the, critically, endangered, ganges, shark, the, name, irrawaddy, is, derived, from, pali, ir, vat, or, air, vat, er, vat, in, pali, is, the, name, of, the, elephant, mount, of, sakka, and, indra, in, hinduism, saka, is, an, important, deva, in, buddhism, and, elephants, were, often, a, symbol, for, water, and, were, used, as, the, name, for, several, other, rivers, such, as, the, achiravati, it, can, also, be, based, on, iravati, who, birthed, the, mythological, elephant, the, irrawaddy, gives, its, name, to, the, irrawaddy, dolphin, orcaella, brevirostris, which, is, found, in, the, lower, reaches, of, the, river, and, known, to, help, fishers, who, practice, cast, net, fishing, though, called, the, irrawaddy, dolphin, it, has, been, also, found, in, the, bay, of, bengal, and, the, indian, ocean, during, the, age, of, discovery, the, irrawaddy, was, also, known, to, european, explorers, as, the, pegu, as, the, main, river, of, the, hanthawaddy, kingdom, itself, known, as, pegu, after, its, capital, now, romanized, as, bago, the, modern, pegu, or, bago, river, is, a, separate, river, tributary, to, the, yangon, after, rudyard, kipling, s, poem, the, river, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, road, to, mandalay, the, irrawaddy, river, bisects, myanmar, from, north, to, south, and, empties, through, the, nine, armed, irrawaddy, delta, into, the, indian, ocean, the, irrawaddy, river, arises, by, the, confluence, of, the, n, mai, nam, gio, and, mali, rivers, in, kachin, state, both, the, n, mai, and, mali, rivers, find, their, sources, in, the, himalayan, glaciers, of, upper, burma, near, 28, n, the, eastern, branch, of, the, two, n, mai, is, the, largest, and, rises, in, the, languela, glacier, north, of, putao, it, is, unnavigable, because, of, the, strong, current, whereas, the, smaller, western, branch, the, mali, river, is, navigable, despite, a, few, rapids, therefore, the, mali, river, is, still, called, by, the, same, name, as, the, main, river, by, locals, the, controversial, myitsone, dam, is, no, longer, under, construction, at, the, convergence, of, these, rivers, the, town, of, bhamo, about, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, south, of, the, mali, and, n, mai, river, confluence, is, the, northernmost, city, reachable, by, boat, all, year, round, although, during, the, monsoons, most, of, the, river, cannot, be, used, by, boats, the, city, of, myitkyina, lies, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, south, of, the, confluence, and, can, be, reached, during, the, dry, season, between, myitkyina, and, mandalay, the, irrawaddy, flows, through, three, well, marked, defiles, this, sheet, of, lava, is, the, singu, plateau, a, volcanic, field, from, the, holocene, this, field, consists, of, magma, from, the, fissure, vents, and, covers, an, area, of, about, 62, square, kilometres, 24, sq, mi, the, plateau, is, also, known, as, letha, taung, leaving, this, plateau, at, kyaukmyaung, the, river, follows, a, broad, open, course, through, the, central, dry, zone, the, bamar, people, s, ancient, cultural, heartland, where, large, areas, consist, of, alluvial, flats, from, mandalay, the, former, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, myanmar, the, river, makes, an, abrupt, westward, turn, before, curving, southwest, to, unite, with, the, chindwin, river, after, which, it, continues, in, a, southwestern, direction, it, is, probable, that, the, upper, irrawaddy, originally, flowed, south, from, mandalay, discharging, its, water, through, the, present, sittaung, river, to, the, gulf, of, martaban, and, that, its, present, westward, course, is, geologically, recent, below, its, confluence, with, the, chindwin, the, irrawaddy, continues, to, meander, through, the, petroleum, producing, city, of, yenangyaung, below, which, it, flows, generally, southward, in, its, lower, course, between, minbu, and, pyay, it, flows, through, a, narrow, valley, between, forest, covered, mountain, ranges, the, ridge, of, the, arakan, mountains, to, the, west, and, that, of, the, pegu, yoma, mountains, to, the, east, the, delta, of, the, irrawaddy, begins, about, 93, kilometres, 58, mi, above, hinthada, henzada, and, about, 290, kilometres, 180, mi, from, its, curved, base, which, faces, the, andaman, sea, the, westernmost, distributary, of, the, delta, is, the, pathein, bassein, river, while, the, easternmost, stream, is, the, yangon, river, on, the, left, bank, of, which, stands, myanmar, s, former, capital, city, yangon, rangoon, because, the, yangon, river, is, only, a, minor, channel, the, flow, of, water, is, insufficient, to, prevent, yangon, harbour, from, silting, up, and, dredging, is, necessary, the, relief, of, the, delta, s, landscape, is, low, but, not, flat, the, soils, consist, of, fine, silt, which, is, replenished, continuously, by, fertile, alluvium, carried, downstream, by, the, river, as, a, result, of, heavy, rainfall, varying, from, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, millimetres, 79, 118, in, a, year, in, the, delta, and, the, motion, and, sediment, load, of, the, river, the, delta, surface, extends, into, the, andaman, sea, at, a, rate, of, about, 50, metres, 160, ft, per, year, due, to, monsoonal, rains, which, occur, between, mid, may, and, mid, october, the, volume, of, the, irrawaddy, and, its, tributaries, varies, greatly, throughout, the, year, in, summer, the, melting, of, the, snow, and, glaciers, in, northern, burma, add, to, the, volume, the, average, discharge, near, the, head, of, the, delta, is, between, a, high, of, 32, 600, cubic, metres, 1, 150, 000, cu, ft, and, a, low, of, 2, 300, cubic, metres, 81, 000, cu, ft, per, second, the, discharge, can, be, as, high, as, 40, 393, cubic, meter, per, second, in, the, rainy, season, over, a, year, the, discharge, averages, 15, 112, cubic, metres, 533, 700, cu, ft, further, north, at, sagaing, the, shows, a, 38, decrease, in, discharge, compared, to, where, the, river, enters, the, delta, it, also, silted, up, around, 278, tons, of, sand, every, year, variation, between, high, and, low, water, levels, is, also, great, at, mandalay, and, prome, a, range, of, 9, 66, to, 11, 37, metres, 31, 7, 37, 3, ft, has, been, measured, between, low, water, level, and, flood, level, respectively, because, of, the, monsoonal, character, of, the, rain, the, highest, point, is, recorded, in, august, the, lowest, in, february, this, variation, in, water, level, makes, it, necessary, for, ports, along, the, river, to, have, separate, landing, ports, for, low, and, high, water, still, low, water, levels, have, caused, problems, for, ports, along, the, river, as, in, the, bamaw, mandalay, pyay, sectors, the, shallowest, point, is, as, shallow, as, 60, centimetres, 2, 0, ft, within, the, basin, the, average, population, density, is, 79, people, km, 2, for, these, people, the, river, supply, amounts, to, 18, 614, m, 3, per, person, per, year, collectively, the, modern, ayeyarwady, irrawaddy, and, thanlwin, salween, rivers, deliver, 600, mt, yr, of, sediment, to, the, sea, most, recent, study, shows, 1, there, is, little, modern, sediment, accumulating, on, the, shelf, immediately, off, the, ayeyarwady, river, mouths, in, contrast, a, major, mud, wedge, with, a, distal, depocenter, up, to, 60, m, in, thickness, has, been, deposited, seaward, in, the, gulf, of, martaban, extending, to, 130, m, water, depth, into, the, martaban, depression, further, 2, there, is, no, evidence, showing, that, modern, sediment, has, accumulated, or, is, transported, into, the, martaban, canyon, 3, there, is, a, mud, drape, blanket, wrapping, around, the, narrow, western, myanmar, shelf, in, the, eastern, bay, of, bengal, the, thickness, of, the, mud, deposit, is, up, to, 20, m, nearshore, and, gradually, thins, to, the, slope, at, 300, m, water, depth, and, likely, escapes, into, the, deep, andaman, trench, 4, the, estimated, total, amount, of, holocene, sediments, deposited, offshore, is, 1290, 10, 9, tons, if, we, assume, this, has, mainly, accumulated, since, the, middle, holocene, highstand, 6000, yr, bp, like, other, major, deltas, the, historical, annual, mean, depositional, flux, on, the, shelf, would, be, 215, mt, yr, which, is, equivalent, to, 35, of, the, modern, ayeyarwady, thanlwin, rivers, derived, sediments, 5, unlike, other, large, river, systems, in, asia, such, as, the, yangtze, and, mekong, this, study, indicates, a, bi, directional, transport, and, depositional, pattern, controlled, by, the, local, currents, that, are, influenced, by, tides, and, seasonally, varying, monsoons, winds, and, waves, no, complete, and, precise, list, of, all, the, fish, in, the, irrawaddy, river, basin, currently, exists, but, in, 1996, it, was, estimated, that, there, are, about, 200, species, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, the, irrawaddy, ecoregion, is, home, to, 119, 195, species, of, fish, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, endemic, several, new, species, of, fish, have, been, described, from, the, irrawaddy, river, basin, in, recent, years, for, example, the, cyprinid, danio, htamanthinus, in, 2016, and, the, stone, loach, malihkaia, aligera, in, 2017, and, it, is, likely, that, undescribed, species, remain, among, the, most, well, known, species, in, the, river, is, the, irrawaddy, dolphin, orcaella, brevirostris, a, euryhaline, species, of, oceanic, dolphin, with, a, high, and, rounded, forehead, lacking, a, beak, it, is, found, in, discontinuous, sub, populations, near, sea, coasts, and, in, estuaries, and, rivers, in, parts, of, the, bay, of, bengal, and, south, east, asia, along, the, north, south, course, of, the, irrawaddy, river, a, number, of, notably, different, ecoregions, can, be, distinguished, the, streams, of, the, nmai, and, mali, that, form, the, irrawaddy, originate, in, high, and, remote, mountains, near, the, border, with, tibet, this, part, of, myanmar, which, extends, north, from, myitkyina, and, the, irrawaddy, confluence, lies, entirely, outside, the, tropics, rain, falls, at, all, seasons, of, the, year, but, mostly, in, the, summer, the, valleys, and, lower, hill, ranges, are, covered, with, tropical, and, subtropical, evergreen, rainforest, instead, of, monsoon, deciduous, forest, this, region, is, characterised, by, subtropical, and, temperate, forests, of, oak, and, pine, are, found, at, elevations, above, 900, metres, 3, 000, ft, this, evergreen, forest, passes, into, sub, tropical, pine, forest, at, about, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, feet, above, 1, 800, metres, 5, 900, ft, are, forests, of, rhododendrons, and, that, in, turn, into, evergreen, conifer, forest, above, 2, 400, metres, 7, 900, ft, feet, the, irrawaddy, river, basin, covers, an, approximate, area, of, 255, 81, km, 2, 31, sq, mi, the, central, basin, consists, of, the, valley, of, the, middle, irrawaddy, and, lower, chindwin, it, lies, within, the, dry, zone, and, consists, almost, entirely, of, plains, covered, with, the, teak, dominated, irrawaddy, moist, deciduous, forests, ecoregion, which, surrounds, dry, forest, patches, in, drier, areas, the, central, basin, receives, little, rain, ave, 650mm, per, year, although, it, does, flood, quickly, during, the, july, october, storms, the, one, meteorological, factor, which, does, not, vary, greatly, and, which, is, the, most, important, for, plant, life, is, atmospheric, humidity, this, is, always, high, except, in, the, winter, in, certain, localities, humidity, usually, does, not, fall, below, 75, and, is, 90, or, more, for, long, periods, during, summer, another, feature, is, the, prevalent, southerly, summer, winds, which, erode, the, soil, of, the, basin, the, natural, habitats, of, this, central, zone, have, been, much, altered, for, farming, and, there, are, few, protected, areas, the, predominant, trees, of, the, drier, patches, are, the, thorny, terminalia, oliveri, and, the, hardwood, dahat, teak, tectona, hamiltoniana, with, stands, of, indaing, dipterocarpus, tuberculatus, which, is, cut, for, timber, the, wildlife, includes, many, birds, small, mammals, and, reptiles, such, as, the, huge, burmese, python, however, most, of, the, large, animals, including, the, tiger, have, been, hunted, out, or, seen, their, habitats, disappear, the, irrawaddy, river, and, its, tributaries, flow, into, the, andaman, sea, through, the, irrawaddy, delta, this, ecoregion, consists, of, mangroves, and, freshwater, swamp, forests, it, is, an, extremely, fertile, area, because, of, the, river, borne, silt, deposited, in, the, delta, the, upper, and, central, portions, of, the, delta, are, almost, entirely, under, cultivation, principally, for, rice, the, southern, portion, of, the, ecoregion, transitions, into, the, burmese, coast, mangroves, and, is, made, up, of, fanlike, marshes, with, oxbow, lakes, islands, and, meandering, streams, birds, of, the, delta, are, both, winter, visitors, and, passage, migrants, including, great, cormorant, phalacrocorax, carbo, a, wide, variety, of, anatidae, eurasian, coot, fulica, atra, about, thirty, species, of, migratory, shorebirds, the, whiskered, tern, chlidonias, hybrida, the, caspian, tern, hydroprogne, caspia, and, the, brown, headed, gull, larus, brunnicephalus, which, is, very, common, one, of, the, most, numerous, wintering, shorebird, is, the, lesser, sand, plover, charadrius, mongolus, which, occurs, in, flocks, of, many, thousands, along, the, outer, coast, of, the, delta, the, wood, sandpiper, tringa, glareola, and, red, junglefowl, gallus, gallus, are, also, abundant, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, spot, billed, pelican, pelecanus, philippensis, nested, in, huge, numbers, in, south, myanmar, one, colony, on, the, sittaung, river, plain, to, the, east, of, the, delta, was, described, in, november, 1877, as, covering, 300, square, kilometres, 100, sq, mi, and, containing, millions, of, birds, immense, colonies, still, bred, in, the, area, in, 1910, but, the, birds, had, disappeared, completely, by, 1939, small, numbers, were, regularly, reported, in, the, delta, in, the, 1940s, but, no, breeding, sites, were, located, as, of, 2010, no, pelicans, have, been, recorded, and, it, may, well, be, that, the, species, is, now, extinct, in, myanmar, several, species, of, large, mammal, occur, in, the, delta, but, their, populations, are, small, and, scattered, with, the, possible, exceptions, of, the, malayan, sambar, deer, cervus, unicolor, equinus, indian, hog, deer, c, porcinus, and, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, which, have, been, reported, from, all, reserved, forests, asian, elephants, elephas, maximus, were, once, widespread, throughout, the, country, with, numbers, as, high, as, 10, 000, animals, but, in, the, last, decade, numbers, have, dwindled, partly, due, to, transferring, the, animals, to, logging, camps, other, species, reported, to, be, present, include, the, leopard, bengal, tiger, crab, eating, macaque, wild, dog, and, otters, panthera, pardus, p, tigris, cuon, alpinus, and, lutra, species, the, saltwater, crocodile, crocodylus, porosus, can, be, found, in, the, southern, part, of, the, delta, the, species, was, formerly, abundant, in, coastal, regions, but, population, numbers, have, decreased, because, of, a, combination, of, commercial, skin, hunting, habitat, loss, drowning, in, fishing, nets, and, over, collection, of, living, animals, to, supply, crocodile, farms, it, was, at, this, river, that, a, battle, between, a, saltwater, crocodile, and, a, tiger, was, observed, that, ended, with, the, reptile, devouring, the, tiger, despite, recent, declines, in, the, sea, turtle, populations, five, species, are, known, to, nest, in, myanmar, at, well, known, island, and, mainland, beaches, known, as, turtle, banks, these, are, the, olive, ridley, sea, turtle, lepidochelys, olivacea, the, loggerhead, sea, turtle, caretta, caretta, the, green, sea, turtle, chelonia, mydas, the, hawksbill, sea, turtle, eretmochelys, imbricata, and, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, dermochelys, coriacea, the, irrawaddy, river, has, five, major, tributaries, as, they, flow, through, the, northern, tip, of, myanmar, the, kachin, state, they, cut, long, north, south, alluvial, plains, and, relatively, narrow, upland, valleys, between, the, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, metres, 7, 000, 10, 000, ft, mountain, ridges, the, rivers, joining, the, irrawaddy, are, from, north, to, south, as, early, as, the, sixth, century, the, bamars, were, using, the, irrawaddy, to, gain, power, in, the, region, through, trade, and, transport, on, the, china, india, route, by, the, twelfth, century, a, well, developed, network, of, canals, made, for, flourishing, rice, cultivation, later, the, river, became, a, key, economic, tool, of, imperial, british, interests, who, set, up, trading, ports, along, its, shores, today, the, irrawaddy, is, still, the, country, s, most, important, commercial, waterway, despite, mandalay, s, position, as, the, chief, rail, and, highway, focus, in, northern, myanmar, a, considerable, amount, of, passenger, and, goods, traffic, moves, by, river, as, the, irrawaddy, delta, is, one, of, the, world, s, major, rice, growing, areas, one, of, the, most, important, goods, transported, is, rice, teak, logs, myanmar, is, one, of, the, world, s, top, exporters, are, floated, down, the, river, as, large, rafts, before, it, is, transported, teak, has, to, be, seasoned, because, otherwise, it, won, t, float, this, happens, by, girdling, a, practice, where, a, deep, circular, cut, through, bark, and, sapwood, is, made, into, the, heartwood, other, major, goods, that, are, transported, from, the, nation, s, heartlands, to, yangon, for, export, are, other, foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton, and, local, commodities, commercial, transportation, on, the, irrawaddy, is, maintained, for, about, 1, 300, kilometres,
