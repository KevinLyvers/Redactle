since, that, time, it, has, been, marked, by, steady, economic, and, population, growth, the, etymology, of, the, name, malang, is, uncertain, one, of, the, theory, said, that, the, name, malang, is, derived, from, the, words, malangku, e, wara, which, means, god, has, destroyed, the, false, and, enforced, the, right, the, words, were, taken, from, an, ancient, term, which, mentions, a, legendary, temple, called, malangku, e, wara, supposedly, located, near, the, city, malang, the, word, malangku, e, wara, was, applied, as, the, motto, of, the, city, of, malang, the, name, malang, first, appeared, on, the, pamotoh, ukirnegara, inscription, 1120, saka, 1198, ad, which, was, discovered, on, 11, january, 1975, by, a, bantaran, plantation, administrator, in, wlingi, blitar, regency, in, the, copper, inscription, one, part, is, written, with, the, following, translation, as, follows, taning, sakrid, malang, akalihan, wacid, lawan, macu, pasabhanira, dyah, limpa, makanagran, i, in, the, east, where, hunting, around, malang, with, wacid, and, the, mancu, dyah, limpa, rice, fields, namely, malang, here, refers, to, an, eastern, of, mount, kawi, although, it, is, known, that, the, use, of, malang, has, at, least, been, going, on, since, the, 12th, century, it, cannot, be, ascertained, the, etymology, of, its, territory, the, first, hypothesis, refers, to, the, name, of, a, holy, building, called, malangku, e, wara, pronounced, the, sacred, building, is, referred, to, in, two, balitung, king, inscriptions, from, ancient, mataram, namely, the, mantyasih, inscription, in, 907, ad, and, the, inscription, of, 908, ad, experts, still, have, not, obtained, an, agreement, on, where, the, building, is, located, on, the, one, hand, there, are, a, number, of, experts, who, say, that, the, malangku, e, wara, building, is, located, in, the, mount, buring, area, a, mountain, that, stretches, east, of, malang, where, one, of, its, peaks, named, malang, others, on, the, other, hand, suspect, that, the, actual, location, of, the, sacred, building, is, in, the, tumpang, area, malang, regency, in, the, area, there, is, a, village, called, malangsuka, which, according, to, historians, comes, from, the, word, malangku, a, pronounced, which, is, pronounced, upside, down, this, opinion, is, reinforced, by, the, existence, of, ancient, relics, around, tumpang, such, as, jago, temple, and, kidal, temple, which, are, in, the, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, singhasari, the, malangku, e, wara, name, consists, of, 3, words, namely, mala, which, means, falsehood, cheating, falsehood, and, evil, angku, a, pronounced, which, means, to, destroy, or, destroy, and, i, wara, pronounced, which, means, god, therefore, malangku, e, wara, means, god, has, destroyed, the, vanity, the, second, hypothesis, refers, to, the, story, of, the, assault, of, the, mataram, sultanate, forces, in, malang, in, 1614, led, by, tumenggung, alap, alap, according, to, folklore, there, was, a, conversation, between, tumenggung, alap, alap, and, one, of, his, assistants, regarding, the, condition, of, malang, before, the, attack, began, the, assistant, from, tumenggung, alap, alap, mentioned, residents, and, soldiers, from, the, area, as, residents, who, blocked, the, halangi, malang, in, javanese, from, the, arrival, of, mataram, troops, after, the, conquest, the, mataram, forces, named, the, area, of, the, conquest, as, malang, the, malang, area, in, the, pleistocene, era, was, still, a, deep, basin, flanked, by, volcanic, activity, from, mountains, such, as, the, karst, mountains, in, the, south, kawi, butak, and, kelud, in, the, west, anjasmoro, and, arjuno, welirang, complex, in, the, northeast, and, north, and, the, tengger, mountains, complex, in, the, east, the, basin, has, not, been, inhabited, by, humans, because, the, condition, is, still, in, the, form, of, lava, and, hot, lava, flows, from, the, surrounding, mountains, towards, the, rainy, season, the, malang, basin, is, filled, with, water, flowing, through, the, mountain, slopes, leading, to, a, number, of, rivers, and, forming, an, ancient, swamp, the, swamps, spread, to, create, ancient, lakes, when, the, ancient, lake, had, not, dried, up, early, human, civilization, was, still, in, the, early, to, advanced, stages, of, hunting, and, collecting, food, the, settlements, are, still, on, the, slopes, of, mountains, and, mountains, that, surround, malang, in, the, form, of, natural, caves, therefore, it, is, understandable, that, the, discovery, of, artifacts, in, the, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, period, is, found, in, mountainous, areas, such, as, on, the, slopes, of, mount, kawi, arjuno, welirang, tengger, semeru, and, the, southern, karst, mountains, malang, ancient, lake, gradually, dried, up, in, the, holocene, era, and, caused, the, malang, region, to, become, a, plateau, in, malang, when, it, began, to, enter, the, planting, period, early, humans, began, to, descend, from, the, mountains, and, make, a, number, of, settlements, and, agricultural, areas, the, discovery, of, a, number, of, artifacts, in, the, form, of, two, square, pickaxes, chalcedony, stone, tools, and, hand, held, andesite, axes, on, the, east, side, of, mount, kawi, in, the, kacuk, area, around, the, metro, and, brantas, streams, reinforced, this, assumption, in, addition, the, study, estimates, that, the, forms, of, occupancy, in, the, transitional, period, were, in, the, form, of, a, stilt, house, where, the, body, of, the, house, was, supported, by, the, legs, of, the, house, and, was, several, meters, above, the, ground, this, is, reinforced, by, the, discovery, of, artifacts, in, the, form, of, watu, gong, or, watu, kenong, in, dinoyo, lowokwaru, malang, whose, forms, are, similar, to, traditional, musical, instruments, namely, gong, which, are, actually, swear, or, foundation, of, a, stilt, house, the, growth, of, settlements, around, the, river, flowing, in, malang, became, the, forerunner, of, the, ancient, civilizations, of, the, homo, sapiens, the, history, of, malang, regency, could, be, revealed, through, the, dinoyo, inscription, at, year, of, 760, as, the, primary, official, document, to, support, the, birth, of, malang, before, a, new, inscription, was, discovered, in, 1986, which, is, yet, to, be, deciphered, according, to, the, inscription, it, was, concluded, that, the, 8th, century, was, the, beginning, of, the, existence, of, malang, regency, s, government, due, to, the, birth, of, king, gajayana, s, ruling, of, his, indianized, hindu, kingdom, in, malang, from, the, dinoyo, inscription, it, is, noted, that, the, inscription, used, the, candra, sengkala, or, cronogram, calendar, and, stated, that, the, birth, date, of, malang, regency, was, on, jum, at, legi, sweet, friday, of, 28, november, 760, kanjuruhan, kingdom, power, is, estimated, to, not, last, long, the, kingdom, was, finally, under, the, rule, of, mataram, ancient, mataram, kingdom, during, the, leadership, of, king, dyah, balitung, 899, 911, ad, in, the, balingawan, inscription, 813, saka, 891, ad, it, is, mentioned, pu, huntu, as, rakryan, kanuruhan, ruler, of, kanuruhan, character, in, the, reign, of, king, mpu, daksa, 911, 919, ad, the, area, that, used, to, be, an, autonomous, kingdom, has, dropped, one, level, to, a, watak, region, that, is, on, a, level, with, the, duchy, or, district, one, level, under, the, authority, of, the, king, watak, kanuruhan, which, covers, the, center, of, malang, today, is, an, entity, that, stands, side, by, side, with, watak, hujung, in, ngujung, toyomarto, village, district, singosari, malang, regency, and, watak, tugaran, in, tegaron, lesanpuro, kedungkandang, malang, regency, which, each, oversees, several, wanua, village, level, when, the, capital, mataram, was, moved, to, the, tamwlang, and, watugaluh, jombang, areas, during, the, reign, of, king, mpu, sindok, 929, 948, ad, several, inscriptions, such, as, sangguran, turyyan, gulung, gulung, linggasutan, jeru, jeru, tija, kanuruhan, muncang, and, wurandungan, describes, a, number, of, tax, liability, policies, for, sima, civil, villages, in, malang, and, a, number, of, land, grant, processes, to, build, temples, there, is, no, record, that, explains, in, detail, the, status, and, role, of, the, area, around, malang, during, king, airlangga, s, leadership, in, addition, to, the, fact, that, malang, entered, the, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, kahuripan, because, the, malang, area, is, no, longer, the, center, of, government, of, the, kingdom, which, is, centered, around, mount, penanggungan, and, sidoarjo, with, its, capital, kahuripan, even, when, raja, airlangga, divided, kahuripan, into, panjalu, which, was, centered, in, daha, kadiri, and, jenggala, which, remained, centered, in, kahuripan, the, malang, region, was, included, as, a, peripheral, of, the, powers, of, both, kingdoms, however, it, can, be, ascertained, that, the, malang, region, entered, the, jenggala, region, at, the, time, of, this, division, the, division, of, kahuripan, shows, that, mount, kawi, was, used, as, the, boundary, of, the, two, new, kingdoms, with, the, eastern, side, obtained, by, jenggala, malang, again, became, an, important, area, in, the, history, of, panjalu, or, jenggala, when, king, jayabhaya, of, panjalu, conquered, jenggala, in, the, hantang, inscription, 1057, saka, 1135, ad, it, is, written, panjalu, jayati, panjalu, menang, signifying, panjalu, s,

kedaton, there, is, no, further, research, on, whether, the, attack, was, a, rebellion, or, attempted, conquest, however, the, existence, of, the, kamulan, inscription, shows, that, there, was, a, new, political, force, that, emerged, to, oppose, panjalu, s, power, this, argument, is, reinforced, by, the, existence, of, the, sukun, inscription, 1083, saka, 1161, ad, which, mentions, a, king, named, jayamerta, who, gave, special, rights, to, sukun, village, allegedly, in, sukun, sub, district, district, sukun, malang, for, fighting, enemies, jayamerta, has, never, been, stated, explicitly,

area, of, origin, of, the, resistance, was, named, purwa, or, purwwa, this, was, supported, by, sunyoto, s, argument, when, referring, to, all, majapahit, rulers, as, descendants, of, ken, arok, who,

from, the, area, which, was, said, to, be, named, purwa, purwwa, was, successfully, crushed, by, panjalu, some, historians, attribute, the, series, of, events, of, resistance, and, crackdown, to, the, socio, political, context, of, the, two, conflicts, involving, king, kertajaya, and, the, brahmin, class, the, first, is, the, policy, of, king, kertajaya, who, tried, to, reduce, a, number, of, rights, from, the, brahmana, class, some, folklore, shows, that, king, kertajaya, wanted, to, be, worshiped, by, the, brahmins, so, that, it, was, contrary, to, the, religious, teachings, of, the, brahmins, the, second, is, the, kidnapping, of, ken, dedes, by, tunggul, ametung, akuwu, equivalent, to, sub, district, head, for, the, tumapel, region, according, to, blasius, suprapto, the, location, of, tumapel, itself, was, in, an, area, formerly, called, kutobedah, now, called, kotalama, kedungkandang, malang, the, implication, of, the, two, conflicts, was, the, withdrawal, of, political, support, from, the, brahmana, class, against, raja, kertajaya, the, collapse, of, panjalu, kadiri, and, the, birth, of, the, tumapel, kingdom, in, malang, originated, from, the, brahmana, class, from, panjalu, who, tried, to, save, himself, from, political, persecution, by, king, kertajaya, they, fled, eastward, and, joined, the, political, forces, in, tumapel, led, by, ken, angrok, or, ken, arok, he, then, rebelled, against, akuwu, tunggul, ametung, and, took, control, of, tumapel, ken, arok, s, victory, was, at, the, same, time, a, statement, of, war, to, separate, himself, from, panjalu, kadiri, the, power, struggle, between, kertajaya, and, ken, arok, towards, the, malang, region, and, its, surroundings, led, to, the, battle, of, ganter, in, ngantang, now, a, sub, district, in, malang, regency, 1144, saka, 1222, ad, which, was, won, by, ken, arok, he, also, ordained, himself, as, the, first, king, of, the, kingdom, of, tumapel, with, the, title, rajasa, sang, amurwabhumi, the, capital, itself, remained, in, tumapel, but, changed, its, name, to, kutaraja, during, the, period, of, the, transfer, of, the, royal, capital, during, the, reign, of, king, wisnuwardhana, from, kutaraja, to, singhasari, singosari, district, malang, regency, in, 1176, saka, 1254, ad, there, was, no, comprehensive, record, of, the, strategic, status, of, the, malang,

only, shows, a, number, of, historical, places, in, malang, such, as, the, gunung, katu, area, in, genengan, prangargo, wagir, malang, regency, which, according, to, historian, dwi, cahyono, is, a, dharma, site, kidjo, rejo, area, kidal, village, district, tumpang, malang, regency, where, raja, anusapati, was, worshiped, in, candi, kidal, and, the, tumpang, area, where, raja, wisnuwardhana, was,

of, power, raden, wijaya, who, held, the, title, of, kertarajasa, jayawardhana, moved, the, center, of, power, to, the, area, he, had, built, in, the, tarik, forest, now, around, mojokerto, and, district, tarik, sidoarjo, however, the, malang, region, witnessed, history, from, the, fate, of, jayakatwang, who, was, exiled, to, another, spring, in, polaman, now, kalirejo, village, lawang, district, malang, regency, according, to, pararaton, and, kidung, harsyawijaya, this, was, where, jayakatwang, was, inspired, to, write, wukir, polaman, his, last, literary, work, before, being, executed, by, raden, wijaya, in, the, majapahit, government, structure, according, to, the, waringin, pitu, inscription, ad, 1447, the, malang, region, is, included, in, the, bhumi, or, the, capital, of, empire, he, is, a, nagara, provincial, equivalent, named, tumapel, which, is, led, by, a, rajya, governor, or, natha, master, or, bhre, nobleman, prince, such, as, dukes, negarakertagama, also, recorded, king, hayam, wuruk, s, visit, to, several, places, in, the, malang, region, in, 1359, ad, according, to, yudi, anugrah, nugroho, the, tour, was, part, of, a, series, of, trips, by, king, hayam, wuruk, to, review, the, development, around, lumajang, this, visit, is, usually, done, when, the, harvest, period, is, over, there, are, at, least, two, contexts, of, the, tour, namely, recreation, and, pilgrimage, for, the, recreational, context, the, first, place, was, kasuranggan, park, in, the, sumberawan, area, toyomarto, village, district, singosari, malang, regency, it, was, here, that, king, hayam, wuruk, built, a, stupa, as, a, place, of, worship, for, buddhists, so, that, it, became, the, sumberawan, temple, as, it, is, now, the, second, is, kedung, biru, some, historians, connect, kedung, biru, with, the, location, now, called, dusun, biru, gunungrejo, village, district, singosari, malang, regency, it, is, called, kedung, meaning, ravine, because, it, is, on, the, edge, of, a, cliff, near, the, klampok, river, in, addition, to, the, recreational, place, of, raja, hayam, wuruk, it, is, said, that, this, place, is, a, sanctuary, for, kris, made, by, mpu, gandring, and, other, royal, weapons, the, third, is, the, bureng, area, identified, as, the, wendit, natural, bath, in, mangliawan, village, district, pakis, malang, regency, for, the, context, of, pilgrimage, king, hayam, wuruk, visited, several, heritage, temples, of, the, singhasari, kingdom, which, aimed, to, dharma, the, ancestors, wangsa, rajasa, some, of, the, temples, visited, include, kidal, temple, in, honor, of, king, anusapati, jago, temple, in, honor, of, king, wisnuwardhana, and, candi, singasari, in, honor, of, raja, kertanegara, especially, for, singasari, temple, there, is, debate, about, whether, it, was, built, during, the, reign, of, singhasari, or, majapahit, kingdom, because, according, to, the, national, library, of, the, republic, of, indonesia, singosari, temple, was, built, around, 1300, ad, the, reign, of, king, raden, wijaya, as, a, temple, of, respect, if, not, dharma, raja, kertanegara, along, with, jawi, temple, however, there, is, an, argument, which, states, that, this, temple, was, being, built, during, the, reign, of, king, kertanegara, itself, as, a, public, worship, temple, the, consequence, of, this, last, argument, is, that, the, construction, of, the, temple, was, not, completed, due, to, the, occupation, of, singhasari, by, jayakatwang, the, malang, region, tumapel, became, one, of, the, objects, of, political, conflict, when, the, regreg, war, erupted, 1404, 1406, this, area, is, claimed, by, aji, rajanata, bhre, wirabhumi, ii, blambangan, banyuwangi, however, the, claim, was, opposed, by, manggalawardhana, bhre, tumapel, ii, who, was, still, the, son, of, king, hayam, wuruk, therefore, this, area, is, considered, as, the, frontline, of, the, battle, involving, majapahit, west, and, blambangan, east, majapahit, however, because, regreg, war, was, won, by, king, wikramawardhana, tumapel, returned, to, majapahit, power, when, the, majapahit, kingdom, arrived, admiral, cheng, ho, from, china, ming, dynasty, in, 1421, ad, he, agreed, with, king, wikramawardhana, 1389, 1429, ad, to, place, ma, hong, fu, and, ma, yung, long, as, ambassadors, of, the, ming, dynasty, at, tumapel, this, can, be, attributed, to, admiral, cheng, ho, s, diplomatic, efforts, to, ensure, the, security, of, ethnic, chinese, in, the, majapahit, region, during, the, war, of, regreg, 1406, around, 170, delegates, from, the, ming, dynasty, were, sent, by, admiral, cheng, ho, to, re, establish, diplomatic, relations, between, china, and, majapahit, after, the, conflict, of, the, jayakatwang, raden, wijaya, kublai, khan, in, the, era, of, transition, from, singhasari, to, majapahit, however, all, the, envoys, were, massacred, by, king, wikramawardhana, who, could, not, distinguish, their, arrival, status, as, an, enemy, or, not, the, role, of, admiral, cheng, ho, was, also, significant, for, the, malang, region, tumapel, in, 1432, when, he, was, with, his, subordinates, gan, eng, cu, and, duke, bhre, of, arya, teja, i, of, tuban, and, his, younger, brother, gan, eng, wan, helped, ratu, maharani, sri, suhita, 1429, 1447, ad, to, unite, daha, kadiri, and, tumapel, after, internal, conflict,
