between, kattegat, and, the, gulf, of, bothnia, due, to, the, fact, that, ensuing, post, glacial, rebound, surpassed, concurrent, sea, level, rise, lake, v, nern, became, a, part, of, the, ancylus, lake, that, occupied, the, baltic, basin, v, nern, was, connected, to, ancylus, lake, by, a, strait, at, degerfors, v, rmland, further, uplifting, made, lakes, such, as, v, nern, and, v, ttern, become, cut, off, from, the, baltic, as, a, result, there, are, still, species, remaining, from, the, ice, age, not, normally, encountered, in, freshwater, lakes, such, as, the, amphipod, monoporeia,
