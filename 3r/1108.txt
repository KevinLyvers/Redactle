in, 1829, this, large, cattle, ranch, rancho, t, a, juana, covered, 100, km, 2, 40, sq, mi, although, tia, juana, means, aunt, jane, in, spanish, the, name, was, actually, an, adaptation, of, the, word, tihuan, or, tiju, n, in, the, kumeyaay, language, the, name, of, a, nearby, kumeyaay, settlement, and, whose, meaning, is, disputed, in, 1848, as, a, result, of, the, mexican, american, war,
