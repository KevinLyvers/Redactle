city, s, extensive, system, of, bayous, so, the, city, could, accept, more, commerce, between, downtown, and, the, nearby, port, of, galveston, by, 1890, houston, was, the, railroad, center, of, texas, in, 1900, after, galveston, was, struck, by, a, devastating, hurricane, efforts, to, make, houston, into, a, viable, deep, water, port, were, accelerated, the, following, year, the, discovery, of, oil, at, the, spindletop, oil, field, near, beaumont, prompted, the, development, of, the, texas, petroleum, industry, in, 1902, president, theodore, roosevelt, approved, a, 1, million,

part, of, the, city, s, population, numbering, 23, 929, people, which, was, nearly, one, third, of, houston, s, residents, president, woodrow, wilson, opened, the, deep, water, port, of, houston, in, 1914, seven, years, after, digging, began, by, 1930, houston, had, become, texas, s, most, populous, city, and, harris, county, the, most, populous, county, in, 1940, the, u, s, census, bureau, reported, houston, s, population, as, 77, 5, white, and, 22, 4, black, when, world, war, ii, started, tonnage, levels, at, the, port, decreased, and, shipping, activities, were, suspended, however, the, war, did, provide, economic, benefits, for, the, city, petrochemical, refineries, and, manufacturing, plants, were, constructed, along, the, ship, channel, because, of, the, demand, for, petroleum, and, synthetic, rubber, products, by, the, defense, industry, during, the, war, ellington, field, initially, built, during, world, war, i, was, revitalized, as, an, advanced, training,

jobs, thousands, of, new, workers, migrated, to, the, city, both, black, and, white, people, competing, for, the, higher, paying, jobs, president, roosevelt, had, established, a, policy, of, nondiscrimination, for, defense, contractors, and, black, people, gained, some, opportunities, especially, in, shipbuilding, although, not, without, resistance, from, white, people, and, increasing, social, tensions, that, erupted, into, occasional, violence, economic, gains, of, black, people, who, entered, defense, industries, continued, in, the, postwar, years, in, 1945, the, m, d, anderson, foundation, formed, the, texas, medical, center, after, the, war, houston, s, economy, reverted, to, being, primarily, port, driven, in, 1948, the, city, annexed, several, unincorporated, areas, more, than, doubling, its, size, houston, proper, began, to, spread, across, the, region, in, 1950, the, availability, of, air, conditioning, provided, impetus, for, many, companies, to, relocate, to, houston, where, wages, were, lower, than, those, in, the, north, this, resulted, in, an, economic, boom, and, produced, a, key, shift, in, the, city, s, economy, toward, the, energy, sector, the, increased, production, of, the, expanded, shipbuilding, industry, during, world, war, ii, spurred, houston, s, growth, as, did, the, establishment, in, 1961, of, nasa, s, manned, spacecraft, center, renamed, the, lyndon, b, johnson, space, center, in, 1973, this, was, the, stimulus, for, the, development, of, the, city, s, aerospace, industry, the, astrodome, nicknamed, the, eighth, wonder, of,

eight, people, died, in, april, 2016, during, a, storm, that, dropped, 17, inches, of, rain, the, worst, came, in, late, august, 2017, when, hurricane, harvey, stalled, over, southeastern, texas, much, like, tropical, storm, allison, did, sixteen, years, earlier, causing, severe, flooding, in, the, houston, area, with, some, areas, receiving, over, 50, inches, 1, 300, mm, of, rain, the, rainfall, exceeded, 50, inches, in, several, areas, locally, breaking, the, national, record, for, rainfall, the, damage, for, the, houston, area, was, estimated, at, up, to, 125, billion, u, s, dollars, and, was, considered, to, be, one, of, the, worst, natural, disasters, in, the, history, of, the, united, states, with, the, death, toll, exceeding, 70, people, houston, s, lack, of, zoning, laws, allowed, unregulated, building, of, residential, homes, and, other, structures, in, flood, prone, areas, however, it, also, resulted, in, more, concentrated, development, in, already, urban, areas, than, in, wetlands, and, suburbs, mayor, sylvester, turner, tweeted, of, hurricane, harvey, that, zoning, wouldn, t, have, changed, anything, we, would, have, been, a, city, with, zoning, that,

to, several, miles, deep, the, region, s, geology, developed, from, river, deposits, formed, from, the, erosion, of, the, rocky, mountains, these, sediments, consist, of, a, series, of, sands, and,

point, eureka, heights, fault, system, which, runs, through, the, center, of, the, city, land, in, some, areas, southeast, of, houston, is, sinking, because, water, has, been, pumped, out, of, the, ground, for, many, years, it, may, be, associated, with, slip, along, the, faults, however, the, slippage, is, slow, and, not, considered, an, earthquake, where, stationary, faults, must, slip, suddenly, enough, to, create, seismic, waves, these, faults, also, tend, to, move, at, a, smooth, rate, in, what, is, termed, fault, creep, which, further, reduces, the, risk, of, an, earthquake, the, city, of, houston, was, incorporated, in, 1837, and, adopted, a, ward, system, of, representation, shortly, afterward, in, 1840, the, six, original, wards, of, houston, are, the, progenitors, of, the, 11, modern, day, geographically, oriented, houston, city, council, districts, though, the, city, abandoned, the, ward, system, in, 1905, in, favor, of, a, commission, government, and, later, the,

outside, the, loop, the, city, s, typology, is, more, suburban, though, many, major, business, districts, such, as, uptown, westchase, and, the, energy, corridor, lie, well, outside, the, urban, core, in, addition, to, interstate, 610, two, additional, loop, highways, encircle, the, city, beltway, 8, with, a, radius, of, approximately, 10, miles, 16, km, from, downtown, and, state, highway, 99, the, grand, parkway, with, a, radius, of, 25, miles, 40, km, approximately, 470, 000, people, lived, within, the, interstate, 610, loop, while, 1, 65, million, lived, between, interstate, 610, and, beltway, 8, and, 2, 25, million, lived, within, harris, county, outside, beltway, 8, in, 2015, though, houston, is, the, largest, city, in, the, united, states, without, formal, zoning, regulations, it, has, developed, similarly, to, other, sun, belt, cities, because, the, city, s, land, use, regulations, and, legal, covenants, have, played, a, similar, role, regulations, include, mandatory, lot, size, for, single, family, houses, and, requirements, that, parking, be, available, to, tenants, and, customers, in, 1998, houston, relaxed, its, mandatory, lot, sizes, from, 5, 000, square, feet, to, 3, 500, square, feet, which, spurred, housing, construction, in, the, city, dramatically, such, restrictions, have, had, mixed, results, though, some, have, blamed, the, city, s, low, density, urban, sprawl, and, lack, of, pedestrian, friendliness, on, these, policies, others, have, credited, the, city, s, land, use, patterns, with, providing, significant, affordable, housing, sparing, houston, the, worst, effects, of, the, 2008, real, estate, crisis, the, city, issued, 42, 697, building, permits, in, 2008, and, was, ranked, first, in, the, list, of, healthiest, housing, markets, for, 2009,
