within, the, holy, roman, empire, since, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, majority, of, archbishops, were, drawn, from, the, bavarian, wittelsbach, dynasty, due, to, the, free, status, of, cologne, the, archbishops, were, usually, not, allowed, to, enter, the, city, thus, they, took, up, residence, in, bonn, and, later, in, br, hl, on, the, rhine, as, members, of, an, influential, and, powerful, family, and, supported, by, their, outstanding, status, as, electors, the, archbishops, of, cologne, repeatedly, challenged, and, threatened, the, free, status, of, cologne, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, resulting, in, complicated, affairs, which, were, handled, by, diplomatic, means, and, propaganda, as, well, as, by, the, supreme, courts, of, the, holy, roman, empire, cologne, lost, its, status, as, a, free, city, during, the, french, period, according, to, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, 1801, all, the, territories, of, the, holy, roman, empire, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, were, officially, incorporated, into, the, french, republic, which, had, already, occupied, cologne, in, 1794, thus, this, region, later, became, part, of, napoleon, s, empire, cologne, was, part, of, the, french, d, partement, roer, named, after, the, river, roer, german, rur, with, aachen, french, aix, la, chapelle, as, its, capital, the, french, modernised, public, life, for, example, by, introducing, the, napoleonic, code, and, removing, the, old, elites, from, power, the, napoleonic, code, remained, in, use, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, until, 1900, when, a, unified, civil, code, the, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, was, introduced, in, the, german, empire, in, 1815, at, the, congress, of, vienna, cologne, was, made, part, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, first, in, the, province, of, j, lich, cleves, berg, and, then, the, rhine, province, the, permanent, tensions, between, the, catholic, rhineland, and, the, overwhelmingly, protestant, prussian, state, repeatedly, escalated, with, cologne, being, in, the, focus, of, the, conflict, in, 1837, the, archbishop, of, cologne, clemens, august, von, droste, vischering, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, for, two, years, after, a, dispute, over, the, legal, status, of, marriages, between, catholics, and, protestants, mischehenstreit, in, 1874, during, the, kulturkampf, archbishop, paul, melchers, was, imprisoned, before, taking, asylum, in, the, netherlands, these, conflicts, alienated, the, catholic, population, from, berlin, and, contributed, to, a, deeply, felt, anti, prussian, resentment, which, was, still, significant, after, world, war, ii, when, the, former, mayor, of, cologne, konrad, adenauer, became, the, first, west, german, chancellor, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, cologne, absorbed, numerous, surrounding, towns, and, by, world, war, i, had, already, grown, to, 700, 000, inhabitants, industrialisation, changed, the, city, and, spurred, its, growth, vehicle, and, engine, manufacturing, was, especially, successful, though, the, heavy, industry, was, less, ubiquitous, than, in, the, ruhr, area, the, cathedral, started, in, 1248, but, abandoned, around, 1560, was, eventually, finished, in, 1880, not, just, as, a, place, of, worship, but, also, as, a, german, national, monument, celebrating, the, newly, founded, german, empire, and, the, continuity, of, the, german, nation, since, the, middle, ages, some, of, this, urban, growth, occurred, at, the, expense, of, the, city, s, historic, heritage, with, much, being, demolished, for, example, the, city, walls, or, the, area, around, the, cathedral, and, sometimes, replaced, by, contemporary, buildings, cologne, was, designated, as, one, of, the, fortresses, of, the, german, confederation, it, was, turned, into, a, heavily, armed, fortress, opposing, the, french, and, belgian, fortresses, of, verdun, and, li, ge, with, two, fortified, belts, surrounding, the, city, the, remains, of, which, can, be, seen, to, this, day, the, military, demands, on, what, became, germany, s, largest, fortress, presented, a, significant, obstacle, to, urban, development, with, forts, bunkers, and, wide, defensive, dugouts, completely, encircling, the, city, and, preventing, expansion, this, resulted, in, a, very, densely, built, up, area, within, the, city, itself, during, world, war, i, cologne, was, the, target, of, several, minor, air, raids, but, suffered, no, significant, damage, cologne, was, occupied, by, the, british, army, of, the, rhine, until, 1926, under, the, terms, of, the, armistice, and, the, subsequent, versailles, peace, treaty, in, contrast, with, the, harsh, behaviour, of, the, french, occupation, troops, in, germany, the, british, forces, were, more, lenient, to, the, local, population, konrad, adenauer, the, mayor, of, cologne, from, 1917, until, 1933, and, later, a, west, german, chancellor, acknowledged, the, political, impact, of, this, approach, especially, since, britain, had, opposed, french, demands, for, a, permanent, allied, occupation, of, the, entire, rhineland, as, part, of, the, demilitarisation, of, the, rhineland, the, city, s, fortifications, had, to, be, dismantled, this, was, an, opportunity, to, create, two, green, belts, gr, ng, rtel, around, the, city, by, converting, the, fortifications, and, their, fields, of, fire, into, large, public, parks, this, was, not, completed, until, 1933, in, 1919, the, university, of, cologne, closed, by, the, french, in, 1798, was, reopened, this, was, considered, to, be, a, replacement, for, the, loss, of, the, university, of, strasbourg, on, the, west, bank, of, the, rhine, which, reverted, to, france, with, the, rest, of, alsace, cologne, prospered, during, the, weimar, republic, 1919, 33, and, progress, was, made, especially, in, public, governance, city, planning, housing, and, social, affairs, social, housing, projects, were, considered, exemplary, and, were, copied, by, other, german, cities, cologne, competed, to, host, the, olympics, and, a, modern, sports, stadium, was, erected, at, m, ngersdorf, when, the, british, occupation, ended, the, prohibition, of, civil, aviation, was, lifted, and, cologne, butzweilerhof, airport, soon, became, a, hub, for, national, and, international, air, traffic, second, in, germany, only, to, berlin, tempelhof, airport, the, democratic, parties, lost, the, local, elections, in, cologne, in, march, 1933, to, the, nazi, party, and, other, extreme, right, parties, the, nazis, then, arrested, the, communist, and, social, democrats, members, of, the, city, assembly, and, mayor, adenauer, was, dismissed, compared, to, some, other, major, cities, however, the, nazis, never, gained, decisive,

reduced, by, 95, this, loss, was, mainly, caused, by, a, massive, evacuation, of, the, people, to, more, rural, areas, the, same, happened, in, many, other, german, cities, in, the, last, two, years, of, war, by, the, end, of, 1945, however, the, population, had, already, recovered, to, approximately, 450, 000, by, the, end, of, the, war, essentially, all, of, cologne, s, pre, war, jewish,
