9, march, 1009, story, of, saint, bruno, in, the, quedlinburg, chronicle, the, chronicle, recorded, a, latinized, form, of, the, name, lietuva, litua, pronounced, due, to, lack, of, reliable, evidence, the, true, meaning, of, the, name, is, unknown, and, scholars, still, debate, it, there, are, a, few, plausible, versions, since, lietuva, has, a, suffix, uva, there, should, be, a, corresponding, original, word, with, no, suffix, a, likely, candidate, is, liet, because, many, baltic, ethnonyms, originated, from, hydronyms, linguists, have, searched, for, its, origin, among, local, hydronyms, usually, such, names, evolved, through, the, following, process, hydronym, toponym, ethnonym, lietava, a, small, river, not, far, from, kernav, the, core, area, of, the, early, lithuanian, state, and, a, possible, first, capital, of, the, eventual, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, is, usually, credited, as, the, source, of, the, name, however, the, river, is, very, small, and, some, find, it, improbable, that, such, a, small, and, local, object, could, have, lent, its, name, to, an, entire, nation, on, the, other, hand, such, naming, is, not, unprecedented, in, world, history, art, ras, dubonis, proposed, another, hypothesis, that, lietuva, relates, to, the, word, lei, iai, plural, of, leitis, from, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, lei, iai, were, a, distinct, warrior, social, group, of, the, lithuanian, society, subordinate, to, the, lithuanian, ruler, or, the, state, itself, the, word, lei, iai, is, used, in, 14, 16th, century, historical, sources, as, an, ethnonym, for, lithuanians, but, not, samogitians, and, is, still, used, usually, poetically, or, in, historical, contexts, in, the, latvian, language, which, is, closely, related, to, lithuanian, the, history, of, lithuania, dates, back, to, settlements, founded, about, 10, 000, years, ago, but, the, first, written, record, of, the, name, for, the, country, dates, back, to, 1009, ad,
