to, replace, the, sahara, base, in, algeria, and, stimulate, economic, growth, in, french, guiana, the, department, was, considered, suitable, for, the, purpose, because, it, is, near, the, equator,

french, guiana, experienced, strong, economic, growth, fueled, by, the, development, of, france, s, guiana, space, centre, established, in, french, guiana, in, 1964, as, the, independence, of, algeria, in, 1962, led, to, the, closure, of, france, s, space, center, in, the, algerian, sahara, and, by, high, population, growth, which, stimulated, domestic, consumption, french, guiana, s, economy, did, not, suffer, from, the, global, financial, crisis, of, 2008, the, gdp, grew, by, an, average, of, 3, 4, per, year, in, real, terms, from, 2002, to, 2012, slightly, faster, than, the, rapidly, growing, population, which, allowed, french, guiana, to, catch, up, marginally, with, the, rest, of, france, in, terms, of, standards, of, living, the, gdp, per, capita, rose, from, 48, 0, of, metropolitan, france, s, level, in, 2000, to, 48, 5, of, metropolitan, france, in, 2012, since, 2013, however, french, guiana, s, economic, growth, has, been, uneven, and, more, subdued, from,

a, significant, role, in, the, local, economy, since, it, was, established, in, kourou, in, 1964, it, accounted, directly, and, indirectly, for, 16, of, french, guiana, s, gdp, in, 2002, down, from,

sanitary, conditions, yellow, fever, and, malaria, eradication, campaigns, started, in, 1949, and, the, establishment, of, the, guiana, space, centre, in, 1964, population, growth, has, been, fueled, both, by, high, birth, rates, and, large, arrivals, of, immigrants, from, metropolitan, france, to, man, the, public, administrations, and, the, space, center, as, well, as, from, neighboring, countries, in, particular, suriname, and, brazil, arrivals, of, surinamese, refugees, reached, record, levels, in, the, 1980s, during, the, surinamese, interior, war, resulting, in, the, highest,
