participating, in, different, activities, shark, attacks, are, a, recurrent, problem, in, recife, metropolitan, area, they, were, addressed, in, the, national, geographic, channel, series, hunter, hunted, in, the, episode, shark, invasion, surfing, has, been, outlawed, since, 1995, on, the, urban, beaches, pina, boa, viagem, piedade, and, candeias, because, of, the, risk, the, sport, poses, to, its, practitioners, due, to, shark, attacks, it, is, strongly, recommended, that, bathers, not, climb, over, and, swim, beyond, the, reefs, because, of, strong, unpredictable, currents, and, the, possible, presence, of, bull, sharks, several, beaches, have, messages, alerting, people, to, the, danger, of, sharks, before, the, 1990s, there, had, been, virtually, no, attacks, reported, here, as, of, june, 28, 1992, recife, began, officially, registering, shark, attacks, on, its, beaches, mainly, on, the, beach, of, boa, viagem, and, between, 1992, and, 2021, there, were, 64, shark, attacks, along, a, 20, km, 12, mi, stretch, of, coast, 26, of, them, being, fatal, the, last, deadly, attack, occurred, on, july, 10, 2021, what, shocked, about, the, shark, attacks, in, recife, is, that, so, many, of, them, are, fatal, 21, of, the, 56, a, death, rate, of, about, 37, this, is, much, higher, than, the, worldwide, shark, attack, fatality, rate, which, is, currently, about, 16, according, to, florida, state, museum, of, natural, history, scientists, believe, most, of, these, attacks, are, committed, by, two, species, bull, sharks, and, tiger, sharks, but, forensic, evidence, has, only, been, able, to, confirm, the, species, responsible, in, eight, of, these, attacks, bull, sharks, are, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, dangerous, shark, species, with, many, proven, attacks, against, humans, there, are, almost, two, million, people, in, recife, and, surrounding, areas, and, there, are, many, beaches, conveniently, located, in, and, around, the, city, but, some, 700, metres, 2, 300, feet, off, the, coast, there, is, a, deep, trench, running, parallel, to, the, beaches, sharks, use, this, trench, as, a, migratory, route, and, emerge, from, it, to, hunt, in, the, shallows, other, facts, contribute, to, the, appearance, of, sharks, in, the, area, of, boa, viagem, beach, the, marine, currents, direct, the, animals, for, that, stretch, of, 20, kilometers, a, sand, bank, extends, into, the, sea, about, a, thousand, meters, from, recife, s, beaches, between, this, long, strip, with, depth, between, 1, and, 3, meters, and, the, beach, a, deep, channel, is, formed, between, 5, and, 8, meters, which, becomes, a, kind, of, refectory, for, sharks, since, it, attracts, several, species, of, rays, one, of, the, prey, of, sharks, the, presence, of, so, many, prey, in, that, area, makes, the, sharks, stay, closer, to, the, beaches, for, longer, and, when, the, shark, enters, these, channels, there, is, a, great, risk, of, contact, with, people, it, is, recife, s, port, suape, though, that, many, see, as, the, biggest, cause, of, the, recent, attacks, located, 20, kilometres, 12, miles, south, of, boa, viagem, beach, where, most, of, the, attacks, have, occurred, the, port, has, been, the, cause, of, much, disturbance, for, marine, life, along, the, coast, and, the, nearby, estuaries, to, facilitate, its, initial, construction, in, the, late, 1970s, two, freshwater, estuaries, which, had, discharged, into, the, atlantic, ocean, were, sealed, off, the, port, opened, for, business, in, 1984, and, today, handles, more, than, four, million, tonnes, of, cargo, per, year, but, it, was, not, until, 1992, that, it, began, to, attract, significant, shipping, traffic, the, passage, of, large, vessels, on, the, coast, of, recife, attracts, sharks, by, clearing, organic, waste, in, the, waters, of, the, sea, before, 1992, recife, had, no, more, shark, attacks, than, any, other, beach, in, brazil, but, the, change, was, immediate, and, dramatic, to, build, the, port, estuaries, were, dredged, and, long, docks, built, protruding, out, into, the, ocean, this, is, especially, a, problem, for, bull, sharks, who, generally, stay, close, to, land, and, are, able, to, tolerate, fresh, water, they, are, regularly, encountered, in, rivers, such, as, the, amazon, much, of, their, life, cycle, is, dependent, on, coastal, estuaries, and, the, building, of, suape, is, thought, to, have, disrupted, breeding, and, hunting, habits, the, destruction, of, the, mangrove, and, the, rectification, of, rivers, have, also, contributed, to, the, imbalance, of, the, ecological, balance, most, sharks, use, the, mangroves, at, least, once, in, life, to, breed, or, feed, the, destruction, of, the, mangrove, swamps, where, the, suape, port, was, built, caused, the, bull, shark, females, that, used, the, place, to, procreate, migrate, to, the, estuary, of, the, jaboat, o, river, to, the, north, this, river, flows, exactly, into, the, beaches, of, recife, cemit, the, council, for, shark, hazard, monitoring, conducts, a, catch, and, release, program, to, remove, the, sharks, from, beaches, 81, sharks, were, caught, tagged, with, tracking, devices, and, released, far, out, to, sea, its, gps, data, on, the, sharks, tagged, show, that, after, being, caught, all, tiger, sharks, have, migrated, to, other, regions, to, get, the, sharks, further, out, to, sea, cemit, in, 2006, sank, three, boats, on, the, far, side, of, the, ocean, trench, to, create, an, artificial, reef, this, was, to, attract, fish, to, congregate, around, the, boats, so, that, sharks, coming, out, of, the, trench, to, hunt, would, move, away, from, the, beach, the, council, for, shark, hazard, monitoring, cemit, recommends, the, following, precautions, to, prevent, the, attack, of, sharks, on, beaches, in, recife, avoid, bathing, between, sunset, and, sunrise, it, is, in, this, period, that, sharks, are, most, active, do, not, enter, the, sea, when, the, tide, is, full, hungry, sharks, get, across, the, reef, if, there, is, enough, water, flowing, over, them, avoid, swimming, alone, and, when, the, water, is, cloudy, do, not, enter, the, water, above, the, waist, and, do, not, swim, in, the, open, sea, in, 1995, the, pernambuco, government, prohibited, the, practice, of, water, sports, on, 32, km, of, coastline, in, the, metropolitan, region, of, recife, this, ban, resulted, in, the, reduction, of, incidents, with, sharks, thereafter, the, state, funded, investigation, has, focused, on, the, long, term, ecological, effects, of, the, new, port, of, suape, based, on, its, findings, local, human, rights, lawyers, are, considering, a, symbolic, legal, challenge, to, the, state, of, pernambuco, with, the, aim, of, securing, compensation, for, the, victims, of, attacks, recife, is, twinned, with, recife, cooperates, with
