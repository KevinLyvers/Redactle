the, western, ghats, also, known, as, the, sahyadri, is, a, mountain, range, that, stretches, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, along, the, western, coast, of, the, indian, peninsula, covering, an, area, of, 160, 000, km, 2, 62, 000, sq, mi, it, traverses, the, states, of, gujarat, maharashtra, goa, karnataka, kerala, and, tamil, nadu, the, range, forms, an, almost, continuous, chain, of, mountains, along, the, western, edge, of, the, deccan, plateau, from, the, tapti, river, to, swamithoppe, in, kanyakumari, district, at, the, southern, tip, of, the, indian, peninsula, the, western, ghats, meet, with, the, eastern, ghats, at, nilgiris, before, continuing, south, geologic, evidence, indicates, that, the, mountains, were, formed, during, the, break, up, of, the, supercontinent, of, gondwana, the, mountains, came, along, the, west, coast, of, india, somewhere, in, the, late, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, periods, when, india, separated, from, the, african, continent, the, mountains, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, parts, the, northern, section, with, an, elevation, ranging, from, 900, 1, 500, m, 3, 000, 4, 900, ft, the, middle, section, starting, from, the, south, of, goa, with, a, lower, elevation, of, less, than, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, and, the, southern, section, where, the, altitude, rises, again, the, western, ghats, have, several, peaks, that, rise, above, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, with, anamudi, 2, 695, m, 8, 842, ft, being, the, highest, peak, the, average, elevation, is, around, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, the, western, ghats, form, one, of, the, major, watersheds, of, india, feeding, many, perennial, river, systems, that, drain, almost, 40, of, the, land, area, of, the, country, because, of, the, higher, elevation, of, the, deccan, plateau, on, the, west, most, rivers, flow, from, eastwards, towards, the, bay, of, bengal, resulting, in, chiselled, eastern, slopes, and, steeper, western, slopes, facing, the, arabian, sea, the, western, ghats, play, an, important, role, in, determining, the, climate, and, seasons, in, india, it, blocks, the, rain, bearing, monsoon, winds, flowing, eastward, from, the, arabian, sea, resulting, in, rainfall, along, the, western, coast, by, the, time, the, air, rises, above, the, mountains, it, becomes, dry, forming, a, rain, shadow, region, with, very, little, rainfall, on, the, leeward, side, towards, the, interior, of, the, deccan, plateau, the, western, ghats, region, is, a, biodiversity, hotspot, it, contains, a, large, number, of, different, species, of, flora, and, fauna, most, of, which, are, endemic, to, this, region, at, least, 325, globally, threatened, species, occur, in, the, western, ghats, the, region, was, declared, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2012, the, name, western, ghats, is, a, portmanteau, of, the, word, ghat, and, the, cardinal, direction, in, which, it, is, located, with, respect, to, the, indian, mainland, ghat, a, term, used, in, the, indian, subcontinent, depending, on, the, context, could, either, refer, to, a, range, of, stepped, hills, such, as, the, eastern, ghats, and, western, ghats, or, a, series, of, steps, leading, down, to, a, body, of, water, or, wharf, as, per, linguist, thomas, burrow, the, word, ghat, was, derived, from, similar, words, used, in, various, dravidian, languages, such, as, kattu, mountain, side, ridge, or, dam, in, tamil, katte, dam, gatta, mountain, and, gattu, bank, or, shore, in, kannada, and, katta, dam, and, gatte, shore, or, embankment, in, telugu, the, ancient, name, for, the, mountain, range, is, sahyadri, derived, from, sanskrit, meaning, benevolent, or, tolerant, mountain, the, western, ghats, are, the, mountainous, faulted, and, eroded, edge, of, the, deccan, plateau, geologic, evidence, indicates, that, they, were, formed, during, the, break, up, of, the, super, continent, of, gondwana, after, the, break, up, the, deccan, plateau, was, formed, by, basalt, rocks, which, caused, the, western, side, to, rise, at, an, elevation, geophysical, evidence, indicates, that, the, mountains, came, along, the, west, coast, of, india, somewhere, in, the, late, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, periods, when, india, separated, from, the, african, continent, several, faults, triggered, the, formation, of, western, ghats, then, interspersed, with, valleys, and, river, gorges, because, of, the, elevation, of, the, deccan, plateau, on, the, west, most, rivers, flow, from, west, to, east, resulting, in, chiselled, eastern, slopes, and, steeper, western, slopes, facing, the, sea, the, western, ghats, extend, from, the, satpura, range, south, of, the, tapti, river, in, the, north, and, runs, approximately, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, to, the, southern, tip, of, the, indian, peninsula, where, it, ends, at, the, marunthuvazh, malai, at, swamithoppe, in, kanyakumari, district, it, covers, an, area, of, 160, 000, km, 2, 62, 000, sq, mi, traversing, across, the, indian, states, of, gujarat, maharashtra, goa, karnataka, kerala, and, tamil, nadu, the, western, ghats, form, an, almost, continuous, chain, of, mountains, running, parallel, to, the, western, coast, of, india, along, the, arabian, sea, the, average, elevation, is, around, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, there, are, three, gaps, in, the, mountain, range, the, northernmost, goa, gap, formed, 65, 80, million, years, ago, mya, the, oldest, and, widest, palghat, gap, formed, 500, mya, and, the, southernmost, narrowest, shencottah, gap, the, narrow, coastal, plain, between, the, western, ghats, and, the, arabian, sea, is, known, as, the, western, coastal, plains, the, mountains, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, parts, the, northern, section, with, an, elevation, ranging, from, 900, 1, 500, m, 3, 000, 4, 900, ft, the, middle, section, starting, from, the, south, of, goa, with, a, lower, elevation, of, less, than, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, and, the, southern, section, where, the, altitude, rises, again, the, western, ghats, meet, with, the, eastern, ghats, at, nilgiris, before, continuing, south, the, western, ghats, have, many, peaks, that, rise, above, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, with, anamudi, 2, 695, m, 8, 842, ft, being, the, highest, peak, the, western, ghats, form, one, of, the, major, watersheds, of, india, feeding, many, perennial, rivers, these, major, river, systems, drain, almost, 40, of, the, land, area, of, the, country, the, major, river, systems, originating, in, the, western, ghats, are, the, godavari, kaveri, and, krishna, most, rivers, flow, eastwards, towards, the, bay, of, bengal, owing, to, the, steeper, gradient, moving, from, east, to, west, and, many, smaller, streams, drain, the, region, often, carrying, a, large, volume, of, water, during, the, monsoon, months, the, streams, and, rivers, give, rise, to, numerous, waterfalls, in, the, region, the, rivers, have, been, dammed, for, hydroelectric, and, irrigation, purposes, with, major, reservoirs, spread, across, the, region, the, western, ghats, play, an, important, role, in, determining, the, climate, and, seasons, in, india, during, the, dry, summer, months, of, april, may, heat, builds, up, on, the, land, which, draws, air, from, the, sea, the, air, which, picks, up, moisture, along, the, way, and, flows, eastward, from, the, arabian, sea, is, blocked, by, the, western, ghats, the, rising, air, cools, and, brings, about, orographic, precipitation, along, the, western, coast, this, signifies, the, onset, of, the, monsoon, season, in, june, by, the, time, the, air, rises, above, the, mountains, it, becomes, dry, resulting, in, a, rain, shadow, region, with, very, little, rainfall, on, the, leeward, side, towards, the, interior, of, the, deccan, plateau, the, monsoon, winds, rounding, up, the, peninsula, and, moving, from, the, east, from, the, bay, of, bengal, pass, over, the, eastern, ghats, and, bring, the, majority, of, the, rainfall, to, the, plains, up, north, climate, in, the, mountains, shows, variations, with, altitude, across, the, range, due, to, its, physical, proximity, to, the, equator, and, the, arabian, sea, the, region, experiences, a, warm, and, humid, tropical, climate, throughout, the, year, mean, temperatures, range, from, 20, c, 68, f, in, the, south, to, 24, c, 75, f, in, the, north, subtropical, or, temperate, climates, and, occasional, near, zero, temperatures, during, winter, are, experienced, in, regions, with, higher, elevations, the, coldest, period, in, the, region, are, the, wettest, monsoon, period, in, the, southern, part, of, the, mountain, range, annual, rainfall, in, this, region, averages, 100, cm, 39, in, to, 900, cm, 350, in, with, an, average, rainfall, of, 250, cm, 98, in, the, total, amount, of, rain, does, not, depend, on, the, spread, of, the, area, areas, in, northern, maharashtra, receive, heavy, rainfall, followed, by, long, dry, spells, while, regions, closer, to, the, equator, receive, lower, annual, rainfall, and, have, rain, spells, lasting, several, months, in, a, year, the, western, ghats, region, is, a, biodiversity, hotspot, it, consists, of, nearly, 30, of, all, the, species, of, flora, and, fauna, found, in, india, most, of, which, are, endemic, to, this, region, at, least, 325, globally, threatened, species, occur, in, the, western, ghats, the, western, ghats, consist,
