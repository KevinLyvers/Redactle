southwest, china, and, eastern, myanmar, burma, with, a, short, section, forming, the, border, of, burma, and, thailand, throughout, most, of, its, course, it, runs, swiftly, through, rugged, mountain, canyons, despite, the, river, s, great, length, only, the, last, 90, km, 56, mi, are, navigable, where, it, forms, a, modest, estuary, and, delta, at, mawlamyine, the, river, is, known, by, various, names, along, its, course, including, the, thanlwin, named, after, elaeocarpus, sp, an, olive, like, plant, that, grows, on, its, banks, in, burma, and, the, nu, jiang, or, nu, river, named, after, nu, people, in, china, the, commonly, used, spelling, salween, is, an, anglicisation, of, the, burmese, name, dating, from, 19th, century, british, maps, due, to, its, great, range, of, elevation, and, latitude, coupled, with, geographic, isolation, the, salween, basin, is, considered, one, of, the, most, ecologically, diverse, regions, in, the, world, containing, an, estimated, 25, percent, of, the, world, s, terrestrial, animal, species, and, thousands, of, plant, species, along, its, course, the, salween, provides, water, for, agriculture, and, supports, abundant, fisheries, especially, in, the, delta, region, the, salween, basin, is, home, to, numerous, ethnic, minority, groups, whose, ancestors, largely, originated, in, the, tibetan, plateau, and, northwest, china, starting, about, 5, 000, years, ago, people, began, migrating, south, along, the, river, establishing, small, kingdoms, and, city, states, during, the, last, 1, 000, years, the, salween, has, defined, various, frontiers, of, the, burmese, empires, to, the, west, the, kingdom, of, siam, to, the, south, and, imperial, china, to, the, east, with, the, shan, states, along, the, middle, salween, being, a, frequently, contested, area, in, the, 19th, century, the, british, empire, invaded, burma, with, mawlamyine, serving, as, the, colonial, capital, for, many, decades, since, burmese, independence, in, 1948, the, salween, basin, has, been, a, battleground, for, several, fronts, of, the, burmese, civil, war, with, large, areas, in, shan, state, and, karen, state, kayin, state, contested, between,

longest, bridge, in, burma, connects, mawlamyine, to, mottama, the, combined, river, then, breaks, into, the, dayebauk, north, and, mawlamyine, south, channels, forming, bilugyun, island, before, emptying, into, the, gulf, of, martaban, major, tributaries, by, average, flow, 1971, 2000, flow, regime, at, hpa, an, station, of, thanlwin, river, monthly, flow, pattern, thanlwin, river, at, hpa, an, during, 2009, to, 2013, the, present, course, of, the, salween, began, to, form, about, 5, million, years, ago, as, the, indian, subcontinent, collided, with, asia, resulting, in, the, uplift, of, the, himalaya, mountains, and, the, tibetan, plateau, prior, to, the, himalaya, orogeny, what, are, now, the, upper, irrawaddy, salween, mekong, and, yangtze, rivers, may, have, all, flowed, into, the, red, river, emptying, into, the, south, china, sea, the, landscape, was, hilly, but, not, particularly, rugged, with, average, elevations, of, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, or, less, as, the, continents, converged, a, complex, jumble, of, mountains, arose, breaking, the, ancestral, red, into, different, drainage, systems, with, the, yangtze, heading, east, towards, the, pacific, and, the, mekong, and, salween, flowing, south, into, what, is, now, thailand, s, chao, phraya, river, about, 1, 5, million, years, ago, volcanic, activity, diverted, the, salween, west, towards, the, andaman, sea, roughly, creating, the, modern, path, of, the, river, the, parallel, modern, courses, of, the, upper, salween, mekong, and, yangtze, are, located, where, the, eastern, tibetan, plateau, intersects, the, uplands, of, the, yunnan, guizhou, plateau, the, mountain, ranges, separating, these, rivers, are, individual, terranes, crustal, fragments, that, accreted, separately, to, the, asian, continent, forming, a, basin, and, range, landscape, with, drainage, running, from, north, to, south, then, compressed, together, such, that, the, rivers, flow, only, 20, km, 12, mi, apart, in, places, as, the, mountains, continued, to, rise, the, rivers, incised, into, the, landscape, along, parallel, fault, zones, creating, the, deep, canyons, of, the, present, day, the, nujiang, fault, zone, stretches, over, 600, km, 370, mi, along, the, river, in, yunnan, the, formation, of, the, himalayas, blocked, drainage, from, the, tibetan, plateau, south, towards, the, indian, ocean, forcing, drainage, north, of, the, mountains, east, towards, the, yangtze, river, this, east, flowing, river, the, predecessor, of, the, modern, yarlung, tsangpo, river, was, repeatedly, captured, into, drainages, to, the, south, finding, various, routes, to, the, sea, via, the, red, mekong, salween, and, irrawaddy, rivers, the, combined, salween, yarlung, tsangpo, drainage, would, have, been, much, longer, than, the, modern, salween, stretching, an, additional, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, west, across, the, tibetan, plateau, ultimately, the, yarlung, tsangpo, was, captured, by, the, brahmaputra, river, in, present, day, india, the, salween, may, once, have, had, additional, tributaries, above, its, present, source, but, due, to, the, uplift, of, the, himalaya, blocking, moisture, from, the, indian, ocean, these, tributaries, dried, up, leaving, the, numerous, terminal, lakes, scattered, across, nagqu, today, the, salween, carries, an, estimated, 108, to, 237, million, tonnes, of, sediment, per, year, about, 92, percent, of, sediment, is, delivered, to, the, ocean, during, the, monsoon, season, the, salween, delta, is, physically, contiguous, with, the, irrawaddy, and, sittaung, deltas, the, irrawaddy, sittaung, salween, delta, is, relatively, stable, with, the, coastline, advancing, an, average, of, 3, 4, m, 11, ft, per, year, between, 1925, and, 2006, sediment, accumulation, is, largely, balanced, out, by, subsidence, and, transport, by, ocean, currents, however, proposed, dams, along, the, salween, would, trap, much, of, the, sediment, with, potential, detrimental, impacts, to, coastal, erosion, the, salween, basin, is, home, to, thousands, of, species, of, plants, with, the, highest, plant, diversity, found, in, yunnan, s, three, parallel, rivers, region, the, three, parallel, rivers, protected, areas, include, the, gaoligongshan, national, nature, reserve, and, the, nu, jiang, reserve, within, the, salween, basin, the, gaoligongshan, reserve, has, more, than, 4, 300, plant, species, the, nujiang, langcang, gorge, alpine, conifer, and, mixed, forests, situated, along, the, nu, river, in, western, yunnan, span, elevations, of, 1, 000, to, 6, 000, m, 3, 300, to, 19, 700, ft, and, range, from, subtropical, broadleaf, evergreen, to, subalpine, conifer, forests, the, rare, taiwania, one, of, the, largest, conifers, in, asia, is, found, here, along, with, more, than, twenty, other, conifer, species, due, to, its, rugged, and, inaccessible, terrain, this, is, considered, one, of, the, most, intact, large, forest, regions, in, china, the, mekong, salween, divide, forms, a, significant, floral, and, faunal, barrier, as, well, as, a, rain, shadow, and, has, been, regarded, as, a, major, driver, of, plant, speciation, in, the, region, around, the, burma, china, border, the, salween, flows, through, the, northern, indochina, subtropical, forests, ecoregion, which, consists, largely, of, subtropical, broad, leaved, evergreen, forests, with, pine, forests, at, higher, elevations, and, tropical, forests, at, the, lower, margins, further, south, in, burma, and, thailand, the, salween, basin, includes, the, kayah, karen, montane, rain, forests, where, the, karst, limestone, landscape, of, cliffs, sinkholes, and, caverns, lends, itself, to, a, multitude, of, forest, types, limestone, soils, host, drought, deciduous, forests, while, dipterocarp, dominant, tropical, forests, occur, on, granitic, soils, montane, deciduous, forests, are, widespread, in, the, shan, hills, mangrove, forests, occur, in, the, salween, delta, especially, on, bilugyun, island, the, basin, supports, about, 151, fish, species, with, 77, of, those, found, in, the, upper, salween, the, salween, has, numerous, cyprinid, species, including, the, endangered, garra, cryptonema, and, akrokolioplax, bicornis, which, are, endemic, to, the, basin, inle, lake, in, shan, state, designated, a, unesco, biosphere, reserve, in, 2015, provides, habitat, for,

islands, in, the, lake, during, the, dry, season, following, the, annual, harvest, the, land, is, used, for, grazing, livestock, in, the, rainy, season, fish, migrate, from, the, salween, river, to, spawn, in, the, lake, and, are, caught, in, large, numbers, as, the, water, level, recedes, at, the, end, of, the, season, the, salween, generally, floods, in, july, september, and, reaches, its, lowest, around, october, december, compared, to, burma, s, principal, rice, growing, region, the, irrawaddy, delta, the, salween, delta, floods, more, erratically, and, is, prone, to, drought, for, 1, 2, years, out, of, five, approximately, 380, 000, ha, 940, 000, acres, of, land, are, irrigated, in, the, salween, basin, with, 50, percent, in, burma, 42, percent, in, china, and, 8, percent, in, thailand, about, 97, percent, is, irrigated, with, surface, water, and, the, rest, with, groundwater, total, water, withdrawals, amount, to, less, than, 3, percent, of, the, river, flow, at, 5, 1, km,

area, cultivated, for, rubber, in, mon, state, increased, fivefold, accompanied, by, significant, deforestation, further, upstream, the, river, provides, a, water, source, for, numerous, remote, villages, with, arable, land, limited, by, mountainous, terrain, farming, occurs, primarily, on, the, seasonally, flooded, river, banks, and, islands, however, forest, land, has, been, increasingly, converted, to, agriculture, which, has, led, to, sedimentation, and, other, water, quality, issues, the, higher, elevation, valleys, are, used, for, grazing, particularly, in, tibet, where, yaks, sheep, goats, horses, and, cattle, are, raised, forests, along, the, salween, in, eastern, burma, are, home, to, dozens, of, medicinal, plants, crucial, to, the, production, of, traditional, herbal, medicines, some, medicinal, plants, are, cultivated, while, others, are, harvested, wild, in, the, forest, many, wild, species, are, threatened, by, deforestation, and, agricultural, conversion, the, salween, estuary, and, delta, is, a, particularly, rich, fishery, with, the, complex, network, of, tidal, channels, providing, a, diversity, of, habitats, for, freshwater, brackish, and, marine, fishes, subsistence, fishing, is, predominant, along, the, inland, channels, and, bays, while, a, large, commercial, fishery, is, supported, offshore, the, most, important, commercial, species, include, nga, pone, na, paradise, threadfin, and, nga, pyat, coitor, croaker, prawns, and, shrimps, are, important, in, the, local, diet, villages, further, upstream, also, depend, on, salween, fish, with, inle, lake, being, a, particularly, rich, fishery, overfishing, combined, with, lack, of, regulation, has, become, an, issue, in, the, 21st, century, with, catches, in, the, lower, salween, declining, as, much, as, 60, percent, at, some, villages, the, use, of, large, bag, nets, that, result, in, excessive, bycatch, as, well, as, the, use, of, illegal, poisons, by, commercial, fishermen, have, also, contributed, to, the, decline, increased, sedimentation, from, upstream, logging, has, made, the, estuary, shallower, and, reduced, its, productivity, in, turn, reducing, the, rate, of, fish, migration, and, spawning, the, burmese, government, has, made, efforts, to, address, the, issues, including, seasonal, fishing, bans, first, implemented, in, 2012, but, these, laws, have, been, rarely, enforced, an, alternative, approach, using, small, self, enforced, community, based, reserves, where, fishing, is, not, allowed, has, successfully, protected, fish, populations, and, species,

the, burmese, part, of, the, basin, first, occurred, on, a, large, scale, during, the, british, colonial, period, in, the, 19th, century, clearcutting, has, destabilized, soils, along, the, river, and, raised, sediment, loads, due, to, the, lack, of, good, roads, across, most, of, the, basin, the, majority, of, timber, is, transported, via, waterways, during, the, rainy, season, in, china, some, forests, in, western, yunnan, were, intensively, logged, until, the, 1990s, when, logging, was, banned, there, due, to, environmental, impacts, the, rate, of, deforestation, has, increased, sharply, in, the, 21st, century, particularly, in, shan, karenni, and, karen, states, before, 2010, armed, conflicts, made, it, difficult, for, logging, companies, to, access, many, of, these, areas, after, a, 2010, peace, agreement, signed, between, ethnic, militias, and, the, myanmar, union, government, commercial, logging, was, able, to, increase, dramatically, in, karenni, state, the, burmese, government, has, banned, the, cutting, of, teak, but, illegal, logging, for, teak, has, persisted, driven, by, strong, demand, abroad, on, the, thai, side, of, the, river, illegal, logging, has, been, ongoing, since, the, 1990s, in, salawin, national, park, in, karen, state, limestone, quarrying, for, cement, production, along, the, river, has, increased, in, the, 21st, century, there, is, also, increasing, sand, and, gravel, mining, in, the, lower, river, as, of, 2015, the, burmese, government, was, seeking, international, investment, in, the, mining, sector, and, new, policies, could, lead,

river, country, and, determined, that, the, upper, salween, mekong, and, red, rivers, previously, believed, to, be, part, of, the, same, river, system, were, in, fact, separate, after, the, rise, of, the, qing, dynasty, china, entered, a, new, period, of, western, expansion, in, 1717, the, dzungar, khanate, conquered, tibet, and, china, sought, to, expel, them, from, the, region, in, 1718, the,

salween, river, in, response, the, qing, sent, a, larger, force, to, tibet, in, 1720, driving, out, the, dzungars, and, establishing, qing, rule, of, tibet, as, the, qing, pushed, into, yunnan, the, indigenous, lisu, people, were, driven, further, west, eventually, settling, along, the, salween, in, and, around, nujiang, prefecture, although, china, had, been, expanding, into, the, area, since, ming, times, the, greatest, influx, of, settlers, was, around, 1700, to, 1850, at, the, same, time, tibet, was, expanding, its, influence, into, western, yunnan, tibetan, parties, raided, down, the, salween, valley, and, took, slaves, from, the, indigenous, nu, and, derung, populations, which, were, not, well, politically, organized, and, unable, to, offer, much, resistance, on, the, other, hand, the, lisu, fiercely, resisted, efforts, to, take, slaves, and, land, in, the, 1590s, siam, had, captured, the, tenasserim, coast, and, the, salween, delta, again, became, the, border, with, burma, for, more, than, a, hundred, years, this, remained, a, disputed, area, changing, hands, several, times, between, the, burmese, and, siamese, burmese, rule, returned, to, the, salween, delta, in, the, 1750s, with, the, expansion, of, the, konbaung, dynasty, starting, in, 1759, martaban, served, as, a, launching, point, for, several, invasions, of, siam, which, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, the, burmese, were, unable, to, maintain, lasting, control, over, territories, east, of, the, river, although, burma, regained, the, tenasserim, coast, from, siam, in, a, 1793, treaty, after, the, first, anglo, burmese, war, in, 1824, the, konbaung, dynasty, ceded, coastal, areas, of, burma, to, the, british, empire, including, the, whole, tenasserim, coast, south, of, the, salween, river, due, to, its, strategic, location, mawlamyine, anglicized, as, moulmein, served, as, the, capital, of, british, burma, from, 1826, until, 1852, and, as, a, gateway, for, overland, trade, into, yunnan, it, became, the, center, of, a, lucrative, timber, industry, particularly, in, teak, logs, were, floated, down, the, salween, river, to, meet, oceangoing, ships, in, mawlamyine, port, forests, in, the, lower, salween, basin, were, extensively, logged, until, the, 1890s, contemporary, british, maps, labeled, the, river, as, salween, an, anglicization, of, the, burmese, name, thanlwin, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, there, was, still, great, uncertainty, regarding, the, true, sources, of, the, river, and, how, far, west, it, extended, into, the, himalayas, some, believed, the, upper, brahmaputra, river, the, yarlung, tsangpo, might, be, the, true, source, of, the, irrawaddy, salween, or, mekong, in, 1935, 36, british, geographer, ronald, kaulback, walked, the, length, of, the, salween, river, from, burma, to, eastern, tibet, producing, some, of, the, first, comprehensive, maps, of, the, river, s, course, kaulback, allegedly, found, giant, footprints, in, the, snow, while, attempting, to, locate, the, source, of, the, salween, his, report, was, one, of, several, that, popularized, the, myth, of, the, yeti, in, europe, during, the, 1930s, during, world, war, ii, the, japanese, empire, invaded, burma, starting, at, mawlamyine, in, january, 1942, the, japanese, army, numbering, 18, 000, against, 7, 000, british, defenders, quickly, captured, mawlamyine, forcing, the, british, to, retreat, across, the, salween, to, martaban, on, february, 10, 11, the, japanese, crossed, the, salween, and, the, british, fled, unprepared, for, a, siege, the, japanese, blockaded, the, burma, road, constructed, in, 1938, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, forcing, the, british, to, transport, military, supplies, to, china, by, air, across, the, eastern, himalayas, the, hump, the, retreating, allied, army, primarily, chinese, stopped, the, japanese, advance, at, the, salween, river, on, may, 5, 1942, after, blowing, all, the, bridges, crossing, the, river, the, chinese, took, defensive, positions, on, the, east, bank, along, a, 100, mile, 160, km, front, at, which, point, the, fighting, reached, a, stalemate, from, 1944, 1945, allied, forces, launched, the, salween, campaign, to, retake, burma, and, reopen, the, burma, road, during, the, initial, offensive, on, may, 11, 1944, about, 40, 000, troops, of, the, chinese, expeditionary, force, cef, led, by, american, general, joseph, stilwell, and, assisted, by, us, army, air, forces, crossed, the, salween, on, rubber, rafts, and, attacked, the, japanese, position, west, of, the, river, about, 17, 000, 19, 000, chinese, and, 15, 000, japanese, were, killed, in, the, resulting, battle, from, which, the, chinese, emerged, victorious, in, the, following, days, additional, cef, troops, crossed, the, river, bringing, the, total, to, 100, 000, before, pushing, west, into, japanese, held, territory, the, salween, campaign, concluded, on, january, 20, 1945, with, the, fall, of, wanding, by, august, 1945, the, allies, had, retaken, burma, from, the, japanese, in, 1948, burma, declared, independence, from, the, british, empire, soon, afterwards, ethnic, minorities, in, the, salween, river, region, including, the, kachin, karen, mon, and, shan, sought, independence, with, armed, conflicts, between, these, groups, and, the, burmese, military, continuing, to, the, present, day, the, karen, national, union, and, mon, national, defense, organization, took, control, of, the, lower, salween, river, valley, including, mawlamyine, and, thaton, in, september, 1948, however, they, were, soon, pushed, out, leading, to, four, years, of, confused, fighting, in, 1952, a, new, karen, state, today, s, kayin, state, was, created, with, the, capital, at, hpa, an, on, the, salween, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, north, of, mawlamyine, but, the, insurgency, continued, in, 1950, chinese, nationalist, troops, invaded, shan, state, after, being, defeated, by, the, communists, in, the, chinese, civil, war, with, the, aim, of, creating, an, independent, state, from, which, to, retake, mainland, china, with, the, help, of, us, forces, the, chinese, attempted, several, times, to, take, land, on, the, west, side, of, the, salween, river, but, were, pushed, back, by, the, burmese, army, although, the, kmt, campaign, was, unsuccessful, many, people, of, chinese, descent, continue, to, live, in, the, area, east, of, the, river, these, events, contributed, to, political, instability, in, shan, state, by, 1958, several, insurgencies, had, become, established, in, eastern, shan, state, including, one, led, by, the, exiled, communist, party, of, burma, cpb, or, white, flag, communists, this, area, part, of, the, golden, triangle, became, a, center, for, illegal, opium, production, during, the, 1960s, opium, trafficking, remains, a, major, source, of, funding, for, insurgents, in, the, 1970s, the, burmese, and, thai, governments, began, planning, for, hydroelectric, dams, on, the, salween, river, largely, within, shan, and, karen, majority, areas, starting, in, 1979, the, electricity, generating, authority, of, thailand, conducted, feasibility, studies, for, hydropower, and, irrigation, diversions, on, the, river, salween, development, plans, gained, momentum, in, 1988, when, the, spdc, seized, power, in, burma, and, sought, cross, border, economic, development, with, thailand, and, china, that, same, year, thai, prime, minister, chatichai, choonhavan, presented, an, economic, vision, for, the, salween, border, region, from, a, battlefield, into, a, marketplace, in, addition, to, the, revenues, from, electricity, production, the, spdc, saw, dam, construction, as, part, of, a, strategy, to, remove, ethnic, armed, groups, from, the, area, in, the, years, following, the, military, junta, stepped, up, its, attacks, in, the, region, destroying, villages, and, forcing, over, 500, 000, shan, kachin, and, karen, refugees, to, flee, the, country, mostly, to, thailand, the, salween, creates, a, formidable, barrier, for, refugees, due, to, its, wide, fast, current, and, only, small, wooden, boats, are, available, for, crossing, it, about, 150, 000, refugees, are, housed, in, official, camps, in, thailand, while, hundreds, of, thousands, of, more, live, in, illegal, camps, thailand, s, salawin, national, park, was, established, in, 1994, before, that, thousands, of, refugees, had, already, settled, in, this, area, and, the, adjacent, salawin, wildlife, sanctuary, with, more, moving, in, during, the, years, following, the, thai, government, has, made, some, efforts, to, remove, them, but, due, to, the, vast, size, of, the, park, enforcement, has, been, difficult, in, 1997, a, scandal, was, uncovered, in, which, logs, cut, on, the, thai, side, of, the, river, were, floated, across, the, river, to, burma, stamped, exported, from, burma, and, floated, back, to, the, thai, side, where, officials, inspected, the, imported, timber, and, approved, their, sale, refugees, in, camps, within, the, parks, were, implicated, in, the, scandal, and, forced, to, relocate, however, observers, of, forced, evictions, have, stated, that, the, eviction, of, thai, karen, villagers, from, forest, reserves, is, not, done, to, protect, the, forests, but, so, that, logging, activities, can, continue, without, hindrance, and, with, fewer, witnesses, after, the, end, of, military, rule, in, 2011, the, burmese, government, signed, ceasefire, agreements, with, 14, ethnic, militias, however, protests, followed, by, armed, conflict, soon, broke, out, again, around, the, sites, of, proposed, dams, particularly, at, the, mong, ton, tasang, dam, in, shan, state, and, the, hatgyi, dam, in, karen, state, residents, along, the, salween, river, contend, the, dams, would, bring, no, economic, benefits, locally, as, most, of, the, electricity, would, be, exported, abroad, while, their, homes, and, traditional, lands, would, be, flooded, with, little, to, no, compensation, ethnic, minority, leaders, and, human, rights, activists, say, a, pattern, they, call, damming, at, gunpoint, has, been, repeated, across, eastern, myanmar, proposed, dam, sites, are, forcefully, depopulated, by, the, military, without, compensation, and, the, region, is, militarized, through, the, expansion, of, army, camps, helicopter, pads, access, roads, and, other, facilities, local, organizations, including, the, karen, environmental, and, social, action, network, kesan, have, pushed, for, the, establishment, of, a, salween, peace, park, that, would, manage, the, river, s, natural, resources, sustainably, via, community, forests, wildlife, sanctuaries, fishery, conservation, and, protected, indigenous, lands, the, park, would, cover, more, than, 5, 000, square, kilometres, 1, 900, sq, mi, along, the, salween, river, and, its, tributaries, in, burma, the, proposal, was, inaugurated, in, december, 2018, seven, dams, have, been, proposed, along, the, main, stem, of, the, salween, in, burma, and, thailand, with, a, combined, capacity, exceeding, 20, 000, megawatts, of, electricity, comparable, to, that, of, china, s, three, gorges, dam, the, reservoirs, would, flood, 691, kilometres, 429, mi, of, the, 1, 200, kilometres, 750, mi, total, river, length, in, burma, as, well, as, the, downstream, ends, of, several, tributaries, electricity, generated, by, these, dams, would, be, exported, primarily, to, china, and, thailand, in, may, 2005, a, formal, memorandum, of, understanding, was, signed, between, burma, and, thailand, to, jointly, develop, hydropower, projects, along, the, salween, river, since, then, a, number, of, chinese, and, thai, companies, have, partnered, to, develop, these, projects, in, 2015, the, newly, elected, national, league, for, democracy, nld, government, was, expected, to, downsize, or, cancel, the, dam, projects, however, the, nld, soon, announced, the, projects, would, go, ahead, the, mong, ton, or, tasang, dam, is, the, largest, of, the, planned, dams, the, dam, would, be, 228, metres, 748, ft, high, and, produce, up, to, 7, 110, megawatts, the, reservoir, would, flood, 870, km, 2, 210, 000, acres, splitting, shan, state, nearly, in, two, the, hatgyi, dam, in, downstream, kayin, state, would, be, smaller, but, would, have, a, more, significant, impact, on, the, river, flow, in, addition, to, producing, power, the, hatgyi, dam, would, divert, up, to, 30, percent, of, the, salween, flow, during, certain, seasons, into, the, ping, river, part, of, thailand, s, chao, phraya, basin, to, benefit, agriculture, in, central, thailand, a, smaller, alternative, to, the, salween, diversion, would, be, a, diversion, of, the, yuam, river, a, tributary, of, the, salween, via, the, moei, river, to, the, ping, tunnels, up, to, 88, kilometres, 55, mi, long, would, have, to, be, constructed, there, are, numerous, concerns, surrounding, the, potential, impact, of, the, dams, particularly, the, effect, on, agriculture, in, the, salween, delta, due, to, a, reduction, in, the, annual, floods, and, sediment, supply, that, maintain, soil, fertility, water, would, be, released, based, on, power, demand, rather, than, agricultural, needs, potentially, causing, water, shortages, and, saline, intrusion, in, the, delta, in, addition, there, would, be, numerous, ecological, impacts, as, the, dams, would, block, fish, migration, and, necessitate, considerable, deforestation, to, clear, the, areas, to, be, flooded, the, dams, would, also, be, located, in, an, area, with, high, earthquake, risk, the, weigyi, and, dagwin, dams, originally, slated, for, the, burma, thailand, border, which, would, have, flooded, parts, of, salawin, national, park, have, been, suspended, since, 2015, five, other, dams, remain, in, the, planning, or, pre, construction, stages, in, 2016, the, burmese, government, announced, its, intention, to, complete, the, remaining, dams, by, 2031, in, 2000, china, initiated, the, west, east, power, transfer, development, scheme, to, develop, large, scale, hydropower, dams, on, its, western, rivers, the, salween, nu, river, basin, within, china, has, an, estimated, 36, 400, megawatts, of, hydropower, potential, the, power, would, be, exported, to, southeastern, china, particularly, the, guangzhou, megalopolis, this, included, thirteen, dams, on, the, mainstem, of, the, nu, with, a, total, capacity, of, 21, 320, megawatts, and, a, number, of, small, to, medium, size, projects, on, tributaries, the, tallest, mainstem, dam, songta, would, be, 307, metres, 1, 007, ft, high, in, 2003, the, yunnan, huadian, nu, river, hydropower, company, was, created, after, an, agreement, between, the, yunnan, provincial, government, and, the, huadian, group, the, proposal, to, develop, the, nu, river, one, of, china, s, last, free, flowing, rivers, was, met, with, large, protests, from, local, residents, as, well, as, from, international, environmental, organizations, if, constructed, the, dams, would, have, displaced, some, 56, 000, people, in, addition, in, 2003, the, unesco, world, heritage, committee, had, voted, to, list, yunnan, s, three, parallel, rivers, region, as, a, world, heritage, site, many, of, the, proposed, dams, fell, within, this, area, in, 2004, premier, wen, jiabao, temporarily, suspended, plans, to, build, dams, on, the, main, stem, of, the, river, although, a, number, of, hydropower, projects, on, tributaries, were, ultimately, built, in, addition, the, chalong, and, jiquan, hydroelectric, projects, were, built, on, the, uppermost, section, of, the, salween, in, tibet, after, wen, s, term, of, office, ended, in, 2013, power, companies, made, a, renewed, push, for, construction, of, the, nu, river, dams, the, yunnan, provincial, government, first, proposed, a, nu, river, grand, canyon, national, park, in, 2007, but, did, not, begin, development, of, this, proposal, until, 2014, in, january, 2016, yunnan, suspended, small, hydropower, development, as, well, as, mining, along, the, nu, river, and, in, may, approved, the, establishment, of, the, national, park, in, december, 2016, china, s, state, energy, administration, formally, dropped, the, nu, river, dams, from, its, hydropower, development, plans, a, major, factor, in, the, cancellation, of, the, dams, was, the, risk, of, earthquakes, along, the, nu, river, fault, zone, download, coordinates, as
