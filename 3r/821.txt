5, and, usd, 86, 5, billion, for, the, high, emission, scenario, rcp, 8, 5, by, the, year, 2050, additionally, rcp, 8, 5, combined, with, the, hypothetical, impact, from, marine, ice, sheet, instability, at, high, levels, of, warming, would, involve, up, to, 137, 5, billion, usd, in, damages, while, the, additional, accounting, for, the, low, probability, high, damage, events, may, increase, aggregate, risks, to, usd, 187, billion, for, the, moderate, rcp4, 5, usd, 206, billion, for, rcp8, 5, and, usd, 397, billion, under, the, high, end, ice, sheet, instability, scenario, since, sea, level, rise, would, continue, for, about, 10, 000, years, under, every, scenario, of, climate, change, future, costs, of, sea, level, rise, would, only, increase, especially, without,
