the, columbia, river, upper, chinook, wimahl, or, wimal, sahaptin, nch, i, w, na, or, nchi, wana, sinixt, dialect, swah, netk, qhu, is, the, largest, river, in, the, pacific, northwest, region, of, north, america, the, river, forms, in, the, rocky, mountains, of, british, columbia, canada, it, flows, northwest, and, then, south, into, the, u, s, state, of, washington, then, turns, west, to, form, most, of, the, border, between, washington, and, the, state, of, oregon, before, emptying, into, the, pacific, ocean, the, river, is, 1, 243, mi, 2, 000, km, long, and, its, largest, tributary, is, the, snake, river, its, drainage, basin, is, roughly, the, size, of, france, and, extends, into, seven, states, of, the, united, states, and, one, canadian, province, the, fourth, largest, river, in, the, united, states, by, flow, the, columbia, has, the, greatest, flow, of, any, river, into, the, eastern, pacific, and, the, 36th, greatest, discharge, of, any, river, in, the, world, the, columbia, and, its, tributaries, have, been, central, to, the, region, s, culture, and, economy, for, thousands, of, years, they, have, been, used, for, transportation, since, ancient, times, linking, the, region, s, many, cultural, groups, the, river, system, hosts, many, species, of, anadromous, fish, which, migrate, between, freshwater, habitats, and, the, saline, waters, of, the, pacific, ocean, these, fish, especially, the, salmon, species, provided, the, core, subsistence, for, native, peoples, the, first, documented, european, discovery, of, the, columbia, river, occurred, when, bruno, de, heceta, sighted, the, river, s, mouth, in, 1775, on, may, 11, 1792, a, private, american, ship, columbia, rediviva, under, captain, robert, gray, from, boston, became, the, first, non, indigenous, vessel, to, enter, the, river, later, in, 1792, william, robert, broughton, of, the, british, royal, navy, commanding, hms, chatham, as, part, of, the, vancouver, expedition, navigated, past, the, oregon, coast, range, and, 100, miles, 160, km, upriver, to, what, is, now, vancouver, washington, in, the, following, decades, fur, trading, companies, used, the, columbia, as, a, key, transportation, route, overland, explorers, entered, the, willamette, valley, through, the, scenic, but, treacherous, columbia, river, gorge, and, pioneers, began, to, settle, the, valley, in, increasing, numbers, steamships, along, the, river, linked, communities, and, facilitated, trade, the, arrival, of, railroads, in, the, late, 19th, century, many, running, along, the, river, supplemented, these, links, since, the, late, 19th, century, public, and, private, sectors, have, extensively, developed, the, river, to, aid, ship, and, barge, navigation, locks, have, been, built, along, the, lower, columbia, and, its, tributaries, and, dredging, has, opened, maintained, and, enlarged, shipping, channels, since, the, early, 20th, century, dams, have, been, built, across, the, river, for, power, generation, navigation, irrigation, and, flood, control, the, 14, hydroelectric, dams, on, the, columbia, s, main, stem, and, many, more, on, its, tributaries, produce, more, than, 44, percent, of, total, u, s, hydroelectric, generation, production, of, nuclear, power, has, taken, place, at, two, sites, along, the, river, plutonium, for, nuclear, weapons, was, produced, for, decades, at, the, hanford, site, which, is, now, the, most, contaminated, nuclear, site, in, the, united, states, these, developments, have, greatly, altered, river, environments, in, the, watershed, mainly, through, industrial, pollution, and, barriers, to, fish, migration, the, columbia, begins, its, 1, 243, mi, 2, 000, km, journey, in, the, southern, rocky, mountain, trench, in, british, columbia, bc, columbia, lake, 2, 690, ft, 820, m, above, sea, level, and, the, adjoining, columbia, wetlands, form, the, river, s, headwaters, the, trench, is, a, broad, deep, and, long, glacial, valley, between, the, canadian, rockies, and, the, columbia, mountains, in, bc, for, its, first, 200, mi, 320, km, the, columbia, flows, northwest, along, the, trench, through, windermere, lake, and, the, town, of, invermere, a, region, known, in, bc, as, the, columbia, valley, then, northwest, to, golden, and, into, kinbasket, lake, rounding, the, northern, end, of, the, selkirk, mountains, the, river, turns, sharply, south, through, a, region, known, as, the, big, bend, country, passing, through, revelstoke, lake, and, the, arrow, lakes, revelstoke, the, big, bend, and, the, columbia, valley, combined, are, referred, to, in, bc, parlance, as, the, columbia, country, below, the, arrow, lakes, the, columbia, passes, the, cities, of, castlegar, located, at, the, columbia, s,

of, the, united, states, canada, border, the, columbia, enters, eastern, washington, flowing, south, and, turning, to, the, west, at, the, spokane, river, confluence, it, marks, the, southern, and, eastern, borders, of, the, colville, indian, reservation, and, the, western, border, of, the, spokane, indian, reservation, the, river, turns, south, after, the, okanogan, river, confluence, then, southeasterly, near, the, confluence, with, the, wenatchee, river, in, central, washington, this, c, shaped, segment, of, the, river, is, also, known, as, the, big, bend, during, the, missoula, floods, 10, 15, 000, years, ago, much, of, the, floodwater, took, a, more, direct, route, south, forming, the, ancient, river, bed, known, as, the, grand, coulee, after, the, floods, the, river, found, its, present, course, and, the, grand, coulee, was, left, dry, the, construction, of, the, grand, coulee, dam, in, the, mid, 20th, century, impounded, the, river, forming, lake, roosevelt, from, which, water, was, pumped, into, the, dry, coulee, forming, the, reservoir, of, banks, lake, the, river, flows, past, the, gorge, amphitheatre, a, prominent, concert, venue, in, the, northwest, then, through, priest, rapids, dam, and, then, through, the, hanford, nuclear, reservation, entirely, within, the, reservation, is, hanford, reach, the, only, u, s, stretch, of, the, river, that, is,

dropping, sediment, that, might, otherwise, form, a, river, delta, at, the, columbia, s, mouth, near, longview, washington, and, the, cowlitz, river, confluence, the, river, turns, west, again, the, columbia, empties, into, the, pacific, ocean, just, west, of, astoria, oregon, over, the, columbia, bar, a, shifting, sandbar, that, makes, the, river, s, mouth, one, of, the, most, hazardous, stretches, of, water, to, navigate, in, the, world, because, of, the, danger, and, the, many, shipwrecks, near, the, mouth, it, acquired, a, reputation, as, the, graveyard, of, ships, the, columbia, drains, an, area, of, about, 258, 000, sq, mi, 670, 000, km, 2, its, drainage, basin, covers, nearly, all, of, idaho, large, portions, of, british, columbia, oregon, and, washington, and, ultimately, all, of, montana, west, of, the, continental, divide, and, small, portions, of, wyoming, utah, and, nevada, the, total, area, is, similar, to, the, size, of, france, roughly, 745, mi, 1, 199, km, of,

states, in, canada, where, the, columbia, flows, for, 498, mi, 801, km, and, drains, 39, 700, sq, mi, 103, 000, km, 2, the, river, ranks, 23rd, in, length, and, the, canadian, part, of, its, basin, ranks, 13th, in, size, among, canadian, basins, the, columbia, shares, its, name, with, nearby, places, such, as, british, columbia, as, well, as, with, landforms, and, bodies, of, water, with, an, average, flow, at, the, mouth, of, about, 265, 000, cu, ft, s, 7, 500, m, 3, s, the, columbia, is, the, largest, river, by, discharge, flowing, into, the, pacific, from, the, americas, and, is, the, fourth, largest, by, volume, in, the, u, s, the, average, flow, where, the, river, crosses, the, international, border, between, canada, and, the, united, states, is, 2, 790, m, 3, s, 99, 000, cu, ft, s, from, a, drainage, basin, of, 102, 800, km, 2, 39, 700, sq, mi, this, amounts, to, about, 15, percent, of, the, entire, columbia, watershed, the, columbia, s, highest, recorded, flow, measured, at, the, dalles, was, 1, 240, 000, cu, ft, s, 35, 000, m, 3, s, in, june, 1894, before, the, river, was, dammed, the, lowest, flow, recorded, at, the, dalles, was, 12, 100, cu, ft, s, 340, m, 3, s, on, april, 16, 1968, and, was, caused, by, the, initial, closure, of, the, john, day, dam, 28, mi, 45, km, upstream, the, dalles, is, about, 190, mi, 310, km, from, the, mouth, the, river, at, this,

the, rifting, of, pangaea, due, to, the, process, of, plate, tectonics, pushed, north, america, away, from, europe, and, africa, and, into, the, panthalassic, ocean, ancestor, to, the, modern, pacific, ocean, the, pacific, northwest, was, not, part, of, the, continent, as, the, north, american, continent, moved, westward, the, farallon, plate, subducted, under, its, western, margin, as, the, plate, subducted, it, carried, along, island, arcs, which, were, accreted, to, the, north, american, continent, resulting, in, the, creation, of, the, pacific, northwest, between, 150, and, 90, million, years, ago, the, general, outline, of, the, columbia, basin, was, not, complete, until, between, 60, and, 40, million, years, ago, but, it, lay, under, a, large, inland, sea, later, subject, to, uplift, between, 50, and, 20, million, years, ago, from, the, eocene, through, the, miocene, eras, tremendous, volcanic, eruptions, frequently, modified, much, of, the, landscape, traversed, by, the, columbia, the, lower, reaches, of, the, ancestral, river, passed, through, a, valley, near, where, mount, hood, later, arose, carrying, sediments, from, erosion, and, erupting, volcanoes, it, built, a, 2, mile, 3, 2, km, thick, delta, that, underlies, the, foothills, on, the, east, side, of, the, coast, range, near, vernonia, in, northwestern, oregon, between, 17, million, and, 6, million, years, ago, huge, outpourings, of, flood, basalt, lava, covered, the, columbia, river, plateau, and, forced, the, lower, columbia, into, its, present, course, the, modern, cascade, range, began, to,

experienced, some, of, the, world, s, greatest, known, catastrophic, floods, toward, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, the, periodic, rupturing, of, ice, dams, at, glacial, lake, missoula, resulted, in, the, missoula, floods, with, discharges, exceeding, the, combined, flow, of, all, the, other, rivers, in, the, world, dozens, of, times, over, thousands, of, years, the, exact, number, of, floods, is, unknown, but, geologists, have, documented, at, least, 40, evidence, suggests, that, they, occurred, between, about, 19, 000, and, 13, 000, years, ago, the, floodwaters, rushed, across, eastern, washington, creating, the, channeled, scablands, which, are, a, complex, network, of, dry, canyon, like, channels, or, coulees, that, are, often, braided, and, sharply, gouged, into, the, basalt, rock, underlying, the, region, s, deep, topsoil, numerous, flat, topped, buttes, with, rich, soil, stand, high, above, the, chaotic, scablands, constrictions, at, several, places, caused, the, floodwaters, to, pool, into, large, temporary, lakes, such, as, lake, lewis, in, which, sediments, were, deposited, water, depths, have, been, estimated, at, 1, 000, feet, 300, m, at, wallula, gap, and, 400, feet, 120, m, over, modern, portland, oregon, sediments, were, also, deposited, when, the, floodwaters, slowed, in, the, broad, flats, of, the, quincy, othello, and, pasco, basins, the,

massive, amounts, of, debris, south, from, table, mountain, and, greenleaf, peak, into, the, gorge, near, the, present, site, of, bonneville, dam, the, most, recent, and, significant, is, known, as, the, bonneville, slide, which, formed, a, massive, earthen, dam, filling, 3, 5, miles, 5, 6, km, of, the, river, s, length, various, studies, have, placed, the, date, of, the, bonneville, slide, anywhere, between, 1060, and, 1760, ad, the, idea, that, the, landslide, debris, present, today, was, formed, by, more, than, one, slide, is, relatively, recent, and, may, explain, the, large, range, of, estimates, it, has, been, suggested, that, if, the, later, dates, are, accurate, there, may, be, a, link, with, the, 1700, cascadia, earthquake, the, pile, of, debris, resulting, from, the,

500, years, ago, in, 1962, archaeologists, found, evidence, of, human, activity, dating, back, 11, 230, years, at, the, marmes, rockshelter, near, the, confluence, of, the, palouse, and, snake, rivers, in, eastern, washington, in, 1996, the, skeletal, remains, of, a, 9, 000, year, old, prehistoric, man, dubbed, kennewick, man, were, found, near, kennewick, washington, the, discovery, rekindled, debate, in, the, scientific, community, over, the, origins, of, human, habitation, in, north, america, and, sparked, a, protracted, controversy, over, whether, the, scientific, or, native, american, community, was, entitled, to, possess, and, or, study, the, remains, many, different, native, americans, and, first, nations, peoples, have, a, historical, and, continuing, presence, on,

average, of, 10, to, 16, million, fish, in, comparison, the, largest, run, since, 1938, was, in, 1986, with, 3, 2, million, fish, entering, the, columbia, the, annual, catch, by, natives, has, been, estimated, at, 42, million, pounds, 19, 000, metric, tons, the, most, important, and, productive, native, fishing, site, was, located, at, celilo, falls, which, was, perhaps, the, most, productive, inland, fishing, site, in, north, america, the, falls, were, located, at, the, border, between, chinookan, and, sahaptian, speaking, peoples, and, served, as, the, center, of, an, extensive, trading, network, across, the, pacific, plateau, celilo, was, the, oldest, continuously, inhabited, community, on, the, north, american, continent, salmon, canneries, established, by, white, settlers, beginning, in, 1866, had, a, strong, negative, impact, on, the, salmon, population, and, in, 1908, us, president, theodore, roosevelt, observed, that, the, salmon, runs, were, but, a, fraction, of, what, they, had, been, 25, years, prior, as, river, development, continued, in, the, 20th, century, each, of, these, major, fishing, sites, was, flooded, by, a, dam, beginning, with, cascades, rapids, in, 1938, the, development, was, accompanied, by, extensive, negotiations, between, natives, and, us, government, agencies, the, confederated, tribes, of, warm, springs, a, coalition, of, various, tribes, adopted, a, constitution, and, incorporated, after, the, 1938, completion, of, the, bonneville, dam, flooded, cascades, rapids, still, in, the, 1930s, there, were, natives, who, lived, along, the, river, and, fished, year, round, moving, along, with, the, fish, s, migration, patterns, throughout, the, seasons, the, yakama, were, slower, to, do, so, organizing, a, formal, government, in, 1944, in, the, 21st, century, the, yakama, nez, perce, umatilla, and, warm, springs, tribes, all, have, treaty, fishing, rights, along, the, columbia, and, its, tributaries, in, 1957, celilo, falls, was, submerged, by, the, construction, of, the, dalles, dam, and, the, native, fishing, community, was, displaced, the, affected, tribes, received, a, 26, 8, million, settlement, for, the, loss, of, celilo, and, other, fishing, sites, submerged, by, the, dalles, dam, the, confederated, tribes, of, warm, springs, used, part, of, its, 4, million, settlement, to, establish, the, kah, nee, ta, resort, south, of, mount, hood, in, 1977, 75, indigenous, fishermen, of, the, yakama, tribe, were, arrested, in, a, federal, sting, operation, which, claimed, that, fishermen, were, poaching, up, to, 40, 000, fish, in, the, columbia, river, fishermen, placed, on, trial, received, sentences, ranging, from, six, months, to, five, years, the, federal, government, pinned, yakama, tribe, member, david, sohappy, ringleader, of, the, operation, after, the, trial, ended, it, was, determined, that, the, fish, were, not, poached, but, driven, away, because, of, harmful, chemicals, present, in, the, power, plant, these, harmful, chemicals, mainly, consisted, of, aluminum, this, event, is, commonly, known, today, as, the, salmon, scam, shortly, after, the, salmon, scam, many, columbia, river, based, indigenous, tribes, received, federally, recognized, status, the, siletz, tribe, was, the, first, to, restore, its, federal, recognition, in, 1977, followed, by, the, cow, creek, band, of, the, umpqua, tribe, in, 1982, the, grand, ronde, tribe, in, 1983, the, lower, umpqua, tribe, siuslaw, tribe, and, coos, tribe, in, 1984, the, klamath, tribe, in, 1986, and, the, coquille, tribe, in, 1989, while, all, the, aforementioned, tribes, received, federally, recognized, status, the, chinook, indian, nation, had, their, federal, recognition, revoked, in, 2002, by, the, bush, administration, and, are, fighting, to, have, it, restored, in, 2023, members, of, the, yakama, nation, expressed, their, dismay, for, the, construction, of, a, goldendale, based, pumped, hydroelectric, energy, storage, project, jeremy, takala, of, the, yakama, nation, embodies, yakama, belief, on, the, importance, of, columbia, river, crops, to, food, and, medicine, stating, the, project, being, proposed, here, it, will, definitely, impact, our, life, the, goldendale, pumped, hydro, storage, unit, could, allow, for, reused, water, use, in, reservoirs, which, would, be, placed, on, mountainous, terrain, overlooking, the, columbia, river, the, mountainous, terrain, where, the, unit, would, be, placed, in, is, juniper, point, referred, to, by, the, yakama, as, pushpum, pushpum, has, rock, formations, as, well, as, food, and, medicine, capabilities, that, are, essential, to, the, yakama, members, of, the, yakama, tribe, wish, for, consent, on, the, goldendale, project, as, opposed, to, consultation, some, historians, believe, that, japanese, or, chinese, vessels, blown, off, course, reached, the, northwest, coast, long, before, europeans, possibly, as, early, as, 219, bce, historian, derek, hayes, claims, that, it, is, a, near, certainty, that, japanese, or, chinese, people, arrived, on, the, northwest, coast, long, before, any, european, it, is, unknown, whether, they, landed, near, the, columbia, evidence, exists, that, spanish, castaways, reached, the, shore, in, 1679, and, traded, with, the, clatsop, if, these, were, the, first, europeans, to, see, the, columbia, they, failed, to, send, word, home, to, spain, in, the, 18th, century, there, was, strong, interest, in, discovering, a, northwest, passage, that, would, permit, navigation, between, the, atlantic, or, inland, north, america, and, the, pacific, ocean, many, ships, in, the, area, especially, those, under, spanish, and, british, command, searched, the, northwest, coast, for, a, large, river, that, might, connect, to, hudson, bay, or, the, missouri, river, the, first, documented, european, discovery, of, the, columbia, river, was, that, of, bruno, de, heceta, who, in, 1775, sighted, the, river, s, mouth, on, the, advice, of, his, officers, he, did, not, explore, it, as, he, was, short, staffed, and, the, current, was, strong, he, considered, it, a, bay, and, called, it, ensenada, de, asunci, n, assumption, cove, later, spanish, maps, based, on, his, sighting, showed, a, river, labeled, r, o, de, san, roque, the, saint, roch, river, or, an, entrance, called, entrada, de, hezeta, named, for, bruno, de, hezeta, who, sailed, the, region, following, hezeta, s, reports, british, maritime, fur, trader, captain, john, meares, searched, for, the, river, in, 1788, but, concluded, that, it, did, not, exist, he, named, cape, disappointment, for, the, non, existent, river, not, realizing, the, cape, marks, the, northern, edge, of, the, river, s, mouth, what, happened, next, would, form, the, basis, for, decades, of, both, cooperation, and, dispute, between, british, and, american, exploration, of, and, ownership, claim, to, the, region, royal, navy, commander, george, vancouver, sailed, past, the, mouth, in, april, 1792, and, observed, a, change, in, the, water, s, color, but, he, accepted, meares, report, and, continued, on, his, journey, northward, later, that, month, vancouver, encountered, the, american, captain, robert, gray, at, the, strait, of, juan, de, fuca, gray, reported, that, he, had, seen, the, entrance, to, the, columbia, and, had, spent, nine, days, trying, but, failing, to, enter, on, may, 12, 1792, gray, returned, south, and, crossed, the, columbia, bar, becoming, the, first, known, explorer, of, european, descent, to, enter, the, river, gray, s, fur, trading, mission, had, been, financed, by, boston, merchants, who, outfitted, him, with, a, private, vessel, named, columbia, rediviva, he, named, the, river, after, the, ship, on, may, 18, gray, spent, nine, days, trading, near, the, mouth, of, the, columbia, then, left, without, having, gone, beyond, 13, miles, 21, km, upstream, the, farthest, point, reached, was, grays, bay, at, the, mouth, of, grays, river, gray, s, discovery, of, the, columbia, river, was, later, used, by, the, united, states, to, support, its, claim, to, the, oregon, country, which, was, also, claimed, by, russia, great, britain, spain, and, other, nations, in, october, 1792, vancouver, sent, lieutenant, william, robert, broughton, his, second, in, command, up, the, river, broughton, got, as, far, as, the, sandy, river, at, the, western, end, of, the, columbia, river, gorge, about, 100, miles, 160, km, upstream, sighting, and, naming, mount, hood, broughton, formally, claimed, the, river, its, drainage, basin, and, the, nearby, coast, for, britain, in, contrast, gray, had, not, made, any, formal, claims, on, behalf, of, the, united, states, because, the, columbia, was, at, the, same, latitude, as, the, headwaters, of, the, missouri, river, there, was, some, speculation, that, gray, and, vancouver, had, discovered, the, long, sought, northwest, passage, a, 1798, british, map, showed, a, dotted, line, connecting, the, columbia, with, the, missouri, when, the, american, explorers, meriwether, lewis, and, william, clark, charted, the, vast, unmapped, lands, of, the, american, west, in, their, overland, expedition, 1803, 1805, they, found, no, passage, between, the, rivers, after, crossing, the, rocky, mountains, lewis, and, clark, built, dugout, canoes, and, paddled, down, the, snake, river, reaching, the, columbia, near, the, present, day, tri, cities, washington, they, explored, a, few, miles, upriver, as, far, as, bateman, island, before, heading, down, the, columbia, concluding, their, journey, at, the, river, s, mouth, and, establishing, fort, clatsop, a, short, lived, establishment, that, was, occupied, for, less, than, three, months, canadian, explorer, david, thompson, of, the, north, west, company, spent, the, winter, of, 1807, 08, at, kootanae, house, near, the, source, of, the, columbia, at, present, day, invermere, bc, over, the, next, few, years, he, explored, much, of, the, river, and, its, northern, tributaries, in, 1811, he, traveled, down, the, columbia, to, the, pacific, ocean, arriving, at, the, mouth, just, after, john, jacob, astor, s, pacific, fur, company, had, founded, astoria, on, his, return, to, the, north, thompson, explored, the, one, remaining, part, of, the, river, he, had, not, yet, seen, becoming, the, first, euro, descended, person, to, travel, the, entire, length, of, the, river, in, 1825, the, hudson, s, bay, company, hbc, established, fort, vancouver, on, the, bank, of, the, columbia, in, what, is, now, vancouver, washington, as, the, headquarters, of, the, company, s, columbia, district, which, encompassed, everything, west, of, the, rocky, mountains, north, of, california, and, south, of, russian, claimed, alaska, chief, factor, john, mcloughlin, a, physician, who, had, been, in, the, fur, trade, since, 1804, was, appointed, superintendent, of, the, columbia, district, the, hbc, reoriented, its, columbia, district, operations, toward, the, pacific, ocean, via, the, columbia, which, became, the, region, s, main, trunk, route, in, the, early, 1840s, americans, began, to, colonize, the, oregon, country, in, large, numbers, via, the, oregon, trail, despite, the, hbc, s, efforts, to, discourage, american, settlement, in, the, region, for, many, the, final, leg, of, the, journey, involved, travel, down, the, lower, columbia, river, to, fort, vancouver, this, part, of, the, oregon, trail, the, treacherous, stretch, from, the, dalles, to, below, the, cascades, could, not, be, traversed, by, horses, or, wagons, only, watercraft, at, great, risk, this, prompted, the, 1846, construction, of, the, barlow, road, in, the, treaty, of, 1818, the, united, states, and, britain, agreed, that, both, nations, were, to, enjoy, equal, rights, in, oregon, country, for, 10, years, by, 1828, when, the, so, called, joint, occupation, was, renewed, indefinitely, it, seemed, probable, that, the, lower, columbia, river, would, in, time, become, the, border, between, the, two, nations, for, years, the, hudson, s, bay, company, successfully, maintained, control, of, the, columbia, river, and, american, attempts, to, gain, a, foothold, were, fended, off, in, the, 1830s, american, religious, missions, were, established, at, several, locations, in, the, lower, columbia, river, region, in, the, 1840s, a, mass, migration, of, american, settlers, undermined, british, control, the, hudson, s, bay, company, tried, to, maintain, dominance, by, shifting, from, the, fur, trade, which, was, in, decline, to, exporting, other, goods, such, as, salmon, and, lumber, colonization, schemes, were, attempted, but, failed, to, match, the, scale, of, american, settlement, americans, generally, settled, south, of, the, columbia, mainly, in, the, willamette, valley, the, hudson, s, bay, company, tried, to, establish, settlements, north, of, the, river, but, nearly, all, the, british, colonists, moved, south, to, the, willamette, valley, the, hope, that, the, british, colonists, might, dilute, the, american, presence, in, the, valley, failed, in, the, face, of, the, overwhelming, number, of, american, settlers, these, developments, rekindled, the, issue, of, joint, occupation, and, the, boundary, dispute, while, some, british, interests, especially, the, hudson, s, bay, company, fought, for, a, boundary, along, the, columbia, river, the, oregon, treaty, of, 1846, set, the, boundary, at, the, 49th, parallel, as, part, of, the, treaty, the, british, retained, all, areas, north, of, the, line, while, the, united, states, acquired, the, south, the, columbia, river, became, much, of, the, border, between, the, u, s, territories, of, oregon, and, washington, oregon, became, a, u, s, state, in, 1859, while, washington, later, entered, into, the, union, in, 1889, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, difficulty, of, navigating, the, columbia, was, seen, as, an, impediment, to, the, economic, development, of, the, inland, empire, region, east, of, the, cascades, the, dredging, and, dam, building, that, followed, would, permanently, alter, the, river, disrupting, its, natural, flow, but, also, providing, electricity, irrigation, navigability, and, other, benefits, to, the, region, american, captain, robert, gray, and, british, captain, george, vancouver, who, explored, the, river, in, 1792, proved, that, it, was, possible, to, cross, the, columbia, bar, many, of, the, challenges, associated, with, that, feat, remain, today, even, with, modern, engineering, alterations, to, the, mouth, of, the, river, the, strong, currents, and, shifting, sandbar, make, it, dangerous, to, pass, between, the, river, and, the, pacific, ocean, the, use, of, steamboats, along, the, river, beginning, with, the, british, beaver, in, 1836, and, followed, by, american, vessels, in, 1850, contributed, to, the, rapid, settlement, and, economic, development, of, the, region, steamboats, operated, in, several, distinct, stretches, of, the, river, on, its, lower, reaches, from, the, pacific, ocean, to, cascades, rapids, from, the, cascades, to, the, dalles, celilo, falls, from, celilo, to, priests, rapids, on, the, wenatchee, reach, of, eastern, washington, on, british, columbia, s, arrow, lakes, and, on, tributaries, like, the, willamette, the, snake, and, kootenay, lake, the, boats, initially, powered, by, burning, wood, carried, passengers, and, freight, throughout, the, region, for, many, years, early, railroads, served, to, connect, steamboat, lines, interrupted, by, waterfalls, on, the, river, s, lower, reaches, in, the, 1880s, railroads, maintained, by, companies, such, as, the, oregon, railroad, and, navigation, company, began, to, supplement, steamboat, operations, as, the, major, transportation, links, along, the, river, as, early, as, 1881, industrialists, proposed, altering, the, natural, channel, of, the, columbia, to, improve, navigation, changes, to, the, river, over, the, years, have, included, the, construction, of, jetties, at, the, river, s, mouth, dredging, and, the, construction, of, canals, and, navigation, locks, today, ocean, freighters, can, travel, upriver, as, far, as, portland, and, vancouver, and, barges, can, reach, as, far, inland, as, lewiston, idaho, the, shifting, columbia, bar, makes, passage, between, the, river, and, the, pacific, ocean, difficult, and, dangerous, and, numerous, rapids, along, the, river, hinder, navigation, pacific, graveyard, a, 1964, book, by, james, a, gibbs, describes, the, many, shipwrecks, near, the, mouth, of, the, columbia, jetties, first, constructed, in, 1886, extend, the, river, s, channel, into, the, ocean, strong, currents, and, the, shifting, sandbar, remain, a, threat, to, ships, entering, the, river, and, necessitate, continuous, maintenance, of, the, jetties, in, 1891, the, columbia, was, dredged, to, enhance, shipping, the, channel, between, the, ocean, and, portland, and, vancouver, was, deepened, from, 17, feet, 5, 2, m, to, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, the, columbian, called, for, the, channel, to, be, deepened, to, 40, feet, 12, m, as, early, as, 1905, but, that, depth, was, not, attained, until, 1976, cascade, locks, and, canal, were, first, constructed, in, 1896, around, the, cascades, rapids, enabling, boats, to, travel, safely, through, the, columbia, river, gorge, the, celilo, canal, bypassing, celilo, falls, opened, to, river, traffic, in, 1915, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, construction, of, dams, along, the, length, of, the, river, submerged, the, rapids, beneath, a, series, of, reservoirs, an, extensive, system, of, locks, allowed, ships, and, barges, to, pass, easily, between, reservoirs, a, navigation, channel, reaching, lewiston, idaho, along, the, columbia, and, snake, rivers, was, completed, in, 1975, among, the, main, commodities, are, wheat, and, other, grains, mainly, for, export, as, of, 2016, the, columbia, ranked, third, behind, the, mississippi, and, paran, rivers, among, the, world, s, largest, export, corridors, for, grain, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, caused, mudslides, in, the, area, which, reduced, the, columbia, s, depth, by, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, for, a, 4, mile, 6, 4, km, stretch, disrupting, portland, s, economy, efforts, to, maintain, and, improve, the, navigation, channel, have, continued, to, the, present, day, in, 1990, a, new, round, of, studies, examined, the, possibility, of, further, dredging, on, the, lower, columbia, the, plans, were, controversial, from, the, start, because, of, economic, and, environmental, concerns, in, 1999, congress, authorized, deepening, the, channel, between, portland, and, astoria, from, 40, to, 43, feet, 12, 13, m, which, will, make, it, possible, for, large, container, and, grain, ships, to, reach, portland, and, vancouver, the, project, has, met, opposition, because, of, concerns, about, stirring, up, toxic, sediment, on, the, riverbed, portland, based, northwest, environmental, advocates, brought, a, lawsuit, against, the, army, corps, of, engineers, but, it, was, rejected, by, the, ninth, u, s, circuit, court, of, appeals, in, august, 2006, the, project, includes, measures, to, mitigate, environmental, damage, for, instance, the, us, army, corps, of, engineers, must, restore, 12, times, the, area, of, wetland, damaged, by, the, project, in, early, 2006, the, corps, spilled, 50, us, gallons, 190, l, of, hydraulic, oil, into, the, columbia, drawing, further, criticism, from, environmental, organizations, work, on, the, project, began, in, 2005, and, concluded, in, 2010, the, project, s, cost, is, estimated, at, 150, million, the, federal, government, is, paying, 65, percent, oregon, and, washington, are, paying, 27, million, each, and, six, local, ports, are, also, contributing, to, the, cost, in, 1902, the, united, states, bureau, of, reclamation, was, established, to, aid, in, the, economic, development, of, arid, western, states, one, of, its, major, undertakings, was, building, grand, coulee, dam, to, provide, irrigation, for, the, 600, thousand, acres, 2, 400, km, 2, of, the, columbia, basin, project, in, central, washington, with, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, the, focus, of, dam, construction, shifted, to, production, of, hydroelectricity, irrigation, efforts, resumed, after, the, war, river, development, occurred, within, the, structure, of, the, 1909, international, boundary, waters, treaty, between, the, united, states, and, canada, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, rivers, and, harbors, act, of, 1925, which, directed, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, and, the, federal, power, commission, to, explore, the, development, of, the, nation, s, rivers, this, prompted, agencies, to, conduct, the, first, formal, financial, analysis, of, hydroelectric, development, the, reports, produced, by, various, agencies, were, presented, in, house, document, 308, those, reports, and, subsequent, related, reports, are, referred, to, as, 308, reports, the, 308, reports, generated, 176, publications, across, the, united, states, of, those, 176, documents, thirteen, of, them, were, generated, in, the, pacific, northwest, in, 1932, one, of, the, thirteen, reports, was, released, on, the, columbia, river, titled, the, columbia, river, and, minor, tributaries, the, report, was, backed, by, many, engineers, and, state, politicians, who, believed, that, the, creation, of, dams, along, the, columbia, river, would, be, a, strong, candidate, for, generation, of, hydroelectric, power, the, report, led, to, congressional, action, where, dams, at, bonneville, and, grand, coulee, were, authorized, in, 1933, the, report, itself, emphasized, the, economic, values, of, dam, creation, additionally, the, reports, emphasized, the, importance, of, dams, for, river, navigation, furthermore, the, reports, emphasized, the, importance, of, hydropower, storage, of, water, for, irrigation, techniques, and, flood, control, to, ensure, that, the, dams, did, not, affect, biodiversity, many, engineers, and, state, politicians, regarded, the, importance, of, salmon, within, the, region, thus, dams, were, to, be, built, at, a, low, height, that, would, permit, salmon, to, pass, over, in, the, late, 1920s, political, forces, in, the, northwestern, united, states, generally, favored, the, private, development, of, hydroelectric, dams, along, the, columbia, but, the, overwhelming, victories, of, gubernatorial, candidate, george, w, joseph, in, the, 1930, republican, primary, and, later, his, law, partner, julius, meier, were, understood, to, demonstrate, strong, public, support, for, public, ownership, of, dams, in, 1933, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, signed, a, bill, that, enabled, the, construction, of, the, bonneville, and, grand, coulee, dams, as, public, works, projects, the, legislation, was, attributed, to, the, efforts, of, oregon, senator, charles, mcnary, washington, senator, clarence, dill, and, oregon, congressman, charles, martin, among, others, in, 1948, floods, swept, through, the, columbia, watershed, destroying, vanport, then, the, second, largest, city, in, oregon, and, impacting, cities, as, far, north, as, trail, bc, the, flooding, prompted, the, u, s, congress, to, pass, the, flood, control, act, of, 1950, authorizing, the, federal, development, of, additional, dams, and, other, flood, control, mechanisms, by, that, time, local, communities, had, become, wary, of, federal, hydroelectric, projects, and, sought, local, control, of, new, developments, a, public, utility, district, in, grant, county, washington, ultimately, began, construction, of, the, dam, at, priest, rapids, in, the, 1960s, the, united, states, and, canada, signed, the, columbia, river, treaty, which, focused, on, flood, control, and, the, maximization, of, downstream, power, generation, canada, agreed, to, build, dams, and, provide, reservoir, storage, and, the, united, states, agreed, to, deliver, to, canada, one, half, of, the, increase, in, united, states, downstream, power, benefits, as, estimated, five, years, in, advance, canada, s, obligation, was, met, by, building, three, dams, two, on, the, columbia, and, one, on, the, duncan, river, the, last, of, which, was, completed, in, 1973, today, the, main, stem, of, the, columbia, river, has, fourteen, dams, of, which, three, are, in, canada, and, eleven, in, the, united, states, four, mainstem, dams, and, four, lower, snake, river, dams, contain, navigation, locks, to, allow, ship, and, barge, passage, from, the, ocean, as, far, as, lewiston, idaho, the, river, system, as, a, whole, has, more, than, 400, dams, for, hydroelectricity, and, irrigation, the, dams, address, a, variety, of, demands, including, flood, control, navigation, stream, flow, regulation, storage, and, delivery, of, stored, waters, reclamation, of, public, lands, and, indian, reservations, and, territories, and, the, generation, of, hydroelectric, power, this, river, may, have, been, shaped, by, god, or, glaciers, or, the, remnants, of, the, inland, sea, or, gravity, or, a, combination, of, all, but, the, army, corps, of, engineers, controls, it, now, the, columbia, rises, and, falls, not, by, the, dictates, of, tide, or, rainfall, but, by, a, computer, activated, legally, arbitrated, federally, allocated, schedule, that, changes, only, when, significant, litigation, is, concluded, or, a, united, states, senator, nears, election, time, in, that, sense, it, is, reliable, timothy, egan, in, the, good, rain, the, larger, u, s, dams, are, owned, and, operated, by, the, federal, government, some, by, the, army, corps, of, engineers, and, some, by, the, bureau, of, reclamation, while, the, smaller, dams, are, operated, by, public, utility, districts, and, private, power, companies, the, federally, operated, system, is, known, as, the, federal, columbia, river, power, system, which, includes, 31, dams, on, the, columbia, and, its, tributaries, the, system, has, altered, the, seasonal, flow, of, the, river, to, meet, higher, electricity, demands, during, the, winter, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, roughly, 75, percent, of, the, columbia, s, flow, occurred, in, the, summer, between, april, and, september, by, 1980, the, summer, proportion, had, been, lowered, to, about, 50, percent, essentially, eliminating, the, seasonal, pattern, upon, its, creation, in, 1942, the, grand, coulee, dam, required, land, inundation, for, construction, this, flooding, included, parts, of, the, colville, reservation, and, spokane, reservation, reservation, flooding, has, resulted, in, the, displacement, of, 2, 250, indigenous, peoples, located, on, said, reservations, the, installation, of, dams, dramatically, altered, the, landscape, and, ecosystem, of, the, river, at, one, time, the, columbia, was, one, of, the, top, salmon, producing, river, systems, in, the, world, previously, active, fishing, sites, such, as, celilo, falls, in, the, eastern, columbia, river, gorge, have, exhibited, a, sharp, decline, in, fishing, along, the, columbia, in, the, last, century, and, salmon, populations, have, been, dramatically, reduced, fish, ladders, have, been, installed, at, some, dam, sites, to, help, the, fish, journey, to, spawning, waters, fish, ladders, have, been, seen, as, highly, effective, when, configurations, to, fishway, exits, are, properly, configured, as, reconstructing, the, bradford, island, fish, ladder, allowed, sockeye, salmon, to, stray, away, from, spillway, zones, reducing, fallback, the, rate, at, which, fish, are, found, moving, away, from, a, dam, post, migration, and, mortality, birthrates, however, improper, construction, of, fish, ladders, can, result, in, salmon, populations, exerting, significantly, more, energy, when, breeding, which, results, in, higher, levels, of, fallback, chief, joseph, dam, has, no, fish, ladders, and, completely, blocks, fish, migration, to, the, upper, half, of, the, columbia, river, system, in, 2019, both, the, yakama, and, lummi, northwest, nations, proposed, to, remove, the, bonneville, john, day, and, the, dalles, dams, due, to, their, belief, removal, would, strengthen, salmon, population, the, former, chairman, of, the, lummi, nation, jay, julius, stated, in, 2019, that, the, fate, of, salmon, without, dam, removal, for, the, lummi, nation, is, a, horrifying, reality, jode, goudy, a, former, chairman, of, the, yakama, nation, coincides, with, beliefs, of, the, lummi, nation, stating, the, columbia, river, dams, were, built, on, this, false, legal, foundation, and, decimated, the, yakama, nation, s, fisheries, traditional, foods, and, cultural, sites, both, nations, have, worked, with, nonprofit, advocacy, organizations, to, further, removal, agendas, throughout, 2021, the, nonprofit, organization, earthjustice, represented, 10, conservation, and, fishing, organizations, in, negotiations, with, president, joe, biden, over, removal, of, dam, operations, on, the, snake, river, these, negotiations, culminated, in, a, lawsuit, with, earthjustice, requesting, to, completely, halt, operations, due, to, their, belief, of, snake, river, dam, effects, on, salmon, and, steelhead, fish, runs, on, december, 15, 2021, the, two, parties, agreed, to, settle, the, dispute, and, focus, on, a, plan, to, mitigate, fish, extinction, proposed, in, december, 2023, president, joe, biden, agreed, to, a, 1, billion, mandate, which, will, attempt, to, reintroduce, columbia, river, salmon, blockaded, by, dams, the, mandate, asked, for, the, bonneville, power, administration, to, supply, us, 300, million, over, a, ten, year, span, starting, in, 2024, which, includes, habitat, restoration, and, upgrades, in, fish, hatcheries, furthermore, the, biden, administration, has, publicly, stated, it, will, examine, the, possibility, of, doubling, fish, and, wildlife, spending, to, meet, tribal, needs, as, a, benchmark, for, financial, utilization, us, 1, billion, in, backlogged, projects, have, been, identified, in, the, columbia, river, basin, the, mandate, did, not, call, for, the, removal, of, four, dams, on, the, snake, river, the, bureau, of, reclamation, s, columbia, basin, project, focused, on, the, generally, dry, region, of, central, washington, known, as, the, columbia, basin, which, features, rich, loess, soil, several, groups, developed, competing, proposals, and, in, 1933, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, authorized, the, columbia, basin, project, the, grand, coulee, dam, was, the, project, s, central, component, upon, completion, it, pumped, water, up, from, the, columbia, to, fill, the, formerly, dry, grand, coulee, forming, banks, lake, by, 1935, the, intended, height, of, the, dam, was, increased, from, a, range, between, 200, and, 300, feet, 61, and, 91, m, to, 500, feet, 150, m, a, height, that, would, extend, the, lake, impounded, by, the, dam, to, the, canada, united, states, border, the, project, had, grown, from, a, local, new, deal, relief, measure, to, a, major, national, project, the, project, s, initial, purpose, was, irrigation, but, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, created, a, high, electricity, demand, mainly, for, aluminum, production, and, for, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, at, the, hanford, site, irrigation, began, in, 1951, the, project, provides, water, to, more, than, 670, thousand, acres, 2, 700, square, kilometers, of, fertile, but, arid, land, in, central, washington, transforming, the, region, into, a, major, agricultural, center, important, crops, include, orchard, fruit, potatoes, alfalfa, mint, beans, beets, and, wine, grapes, since, 1750, the, columbia, has, experienced, six, multi, year, droughts, the, longest, lasting, 12, years, in, the, mid, 19th, century, reduced, the, river, s, flow, to, 20, percent, below, average, scientists, have, expressed, concern, that, a, similar, drought, would, have, grave, consequences, in, a, region, so, dependent, on, the, columbia, in, 1992, 1993, a, lesser, drought, affected, farmers, hydroelectric, power, producers, shippers, and,

are, ocean, fish, that, migrate, up, the, rivers, at, the, end, of, their, life, cycles, to, spawn, white, sturgeon, which, take, 15, to, 25, years, to, mature, typically, migrate, between, the, ocean, and, the, upstream, habitat, several, times, during, their, lives, salmon, populations, declined, dramatically, after, the, establishment, of, canneries, in, 1867, in, 1879, it, was, reported, that, 545, 450, salmon, with, an, average, weight, of, 22, pounds, 10, 0, kg, were, caught, in, a, recent, season, and, mainly, canned, for, export, to, england, a, can, weighing, 1, pound, 0, 45, kg, could, be, sold, for, 8d, or, 9d, by, 1908, there, was, widespread, concern, about, the, decline, of, salmon, and, sturgeon, in, that, year, the, people, of, oregon, passed, two, laws, under, their, newly, instituted, program, of, citizens, initiatives, limiting, fishing, on, the, columbia, and, other, rivers, then, in, 1948, another, initiative, banned, the, use, of, seine, nets, devices, already, used, by, native, americans, and, refined, by, later, settlers, altogether, dams, interrupt, the, migration, of, anadromous, fish, salmon, and, steelhead, return, to, the, streams, in, which, they, were, born, to, spawn, where, dams, prevent, their, return, entire, populations, of, salmon, die, some, of, the, columbia, and, snake, river, dams, employ, fish, ladders, which, are, effective, to, varying, degrees, at, allowing, these, fish, to, travel, upstream, another, problem, exists, for, the, juvenile, salmon, headed, downstream, to, the, ocean, previously, this, journey, would, have, taken, two, to, three, weeks, with, river, currents, slowed, by, the, dams, and, the, columbia, converted, from, a, wild, river, to, a, series, of, slackwater, pools, the, journey, can, take, several, months, which, increases, the, mortality, rate, in, some, cases, the, army, corps, of, engineers, transports, juvenile, fish, downstream, by, truck, or, river, barge, the, chief, joseph, dam, and, several, dams, on, the, columbia, s, tributaries, entirely, block, migration, and, there, are, no, migrating, fish, on, the, river, above, these, dams, sturgeons, have, different, migration, habits, and, can, survive, without, ever, visiting, the, ocean, in, many, upstream, areas, cut, off, from, the, ocean, by, dams, sturgeon, simply, live, upstream, of, the, dam, not, all, fish, have, suffered, from, the, modifications, to, the, river, the, northern, pikeminnow, formerly, known, as, the, squawfish, thrives, in, the, warmer, slower, water, created, by, the, dams, research, in, the, mid, 1980s, found, that, juvenile, salmon, were, suffering, substantially, from, the, predatory, pikeminnow, and, in, 1990, in, the, interest, of, protecting, salmon, a, bounty, program, was, established, to, reward, anglers, for, catching, pikeminnow, in, 1994, the, salmon, catch, was, smaller, than, usual, in, the, rivers, of, oregon, washington, and, british, columbia, causing, concern, among, commercial, fishermen, government, agencies, and, tribal, leaders, us, government, intervention, to, which, the, states, of, alaska, idaho, and, oregon, objected, included, an, 11, day, closure, of, an, alaska, fishery, in, april, 1994, the, pacific, fisheries, management, council, unanimously, approved, the, strictest, regulations, in, 18, years, banning, all, commercial, salmon, fishing, for, that, year, from, cape, falcon, north, to, the, canada, us, border, in, the, winter, of, 1994, the, return, of, coho, salmon, far, exceeded, expectations, which, was, attributed, in, part, to, the, fishing, ban, also, in, 1994, united, states, secretary, of, the, interior, bruce, babbitt, proposed, the, removal, of, several, pacific, northwest, dams, because, of, their, impact, on, salmon, spawning, the, northwest, power, planning, council, approved, a, plan, that, provided, more, water, for, fish, and, less, for, electricity, irrigation, and, transportation, environmental, advocates, have, called, for, the, removal, of, certain, dams, in, the, columbia, system, in, the, years, since, of, the, 227, major, dams, in, the, columbia, river, drainage, basin, the, four, washington, dams, on, the, lower, snake, river, are, often, identified, for, removal, for, example, in, an, ongoing, lawsuit, concerning, a, bush, administration, plan, for, salmon, recovery, these, dams, and, reservoirs, limit, the, recovery, of, upriver, salmon, runs, to, idaho, s, salmon, and, clearwater, rivers, historically, the, snake, produced, over, 1, 5, million, spring, and, summer, chinook, salmon, a, number, that, has, dwindled, to, several, thousand, in, recent, years, idaho, power, company, s, hells, canyon, dams, have, no, fish, ladders, and, do, not, pass, juvenile, salmon, downstream, and, thus, allow, no, steelhead, or, salmon, to, migrate, above, hells, canyon, in, 2007, the, destruction, of, the, marmot, dam, on, the, sandy, river, was, the, first, dam, removal, in, the, system, other, columbia, basin, dams, that, have, been, removed, include, condit, dam, on, washington, s, white, salmon, river, and, the, milltown, dam, on, the, clark, fork, in, montana, in, southeastern, washington, a, 50, mile, 80, km, stretch, of, the, river, passes, through, the, hanford, site, established, in, 1943, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, the, site, served, as, a, plutonium, production, complex, with, nine, nuclear, reactors, and, related, facilities, along, the, banks, of, the, river, from, 1944, to, 1971, pump, systems, drew, cooling, water, from, the, river, and, after, treating, this, water, for, use, by, the, reactors, returned, it, to, the, river, before, being, released, back, into, the, river, the, used, water, was, held, in, large, tanks, known, as, retention, basins, for, up, to, six, hours, longer, lived, isotopes, were, not, affected, by, this, retention, and, several, terabecquerels, entered, the, river, every, day, by, 1957, the, eight, plutonium, production, reactors, at, hanford, dumped, a, daily, average, of, 50, 000, curies, of, radioactive, material, into, the, columbia, these, releases, were, kept, secret, by, the, federal, government, until, the, release, of, declassified, documents, in, the, late, 1980s, radiation, was, measured, downstream, as, far, west, as, the, washington, and, oregon, coasts, the, nuclear, reactors, were, decommissioned, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, the, hanford, site, is, the, focus, of, one, of, the, world, s, largest, environmental, cleanup, managed, by, the, department,

to, more, than, 14, 000, feet, 4, 300, m, in, the, mountains, and, temperatures, vary, with, elevation, the, highest, peak, is, mount, rainier, at, 14, 411, feet, 4, 392, m, high, elevations, have, cold, winters, and, short, cool, summers, interior, regions, are, subject, to, great, temperature, variability, and, severe, droughts, over, some, of, the, watershed, especially, west, of, the, cascade, mountains, precipitation, maximums, occur, in, winter, when, pacific, storms, come, ashore, atmospheric, conditions, block, the, flow, of, moisture, in, summer, which, is, generally, dry, except, for, occasional, thunderstorms, in, the, interior, in, some, of, the, eastern, parts, of, the, watershed, especially, shrub, steppe, regions, with, continental, climate, patterns, precipitation, maximums, occur, in, early, summer, annual, precipitation, varies, from, more, than, 100, inches, 250, cm, a, year, in, the, cascades, to, less, than, 8, inches, 20, cm, in, the, interior, much, of, the, watershed, gets, less, than, 12, inches, 30, cm, a, year, several, major, north, american, drainage, basins, and, many, minor, ones, border, the, columbia, river, s, drainage, basin, to, the, east, in, northern, wyoming, and, montana, the, continental, divide, separates, the, columbia, watershed, from, the, mississippi, missouri, watershed, which, empties, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, northeast, mostly, along, the, southern, border, between, british, columbia, and, alberta, the, continental, divide, separates, the, columbia, watershed, from, the, nelson, lake, winnipeg, saskatchewan, watershed, which, empties, into, hudson, bay, the, mississippi, and, nelson, watersheds, are, separated, by, the, laurentian, divide, which, meets, the, continental, divide, at, triple, divide, peak, near, the, headwaters, of, the, columbia, s, flathead, river, tributary, this, point, marks, the, meeting, of, three, of, north, america, s, main, drainage, patterns, to, the, pacific, ocean, to, hudson, bay, and, to, the, atlantic, ocean, via, the, gulf, of, mexico, further, north, along, the, continental, divide, a, short, portion, of, the, combined, continental, and, laurentian, divides, separate, the, columbia, watershed, from, the, mackenzie, slave, athabasca, watershed, which, empties, into, the, arctic, ocean, the, nelson, and, mackenzie, watersheds, are, separated, by, a, divide, between, streams, flowing, to, the, arctic, ocean, and, those, of, the, hudson, bay, watershed, this, divide, meets, the, continental, divide, at, snow, dome, also, known, as, dome, near, the, northernmost, bend, of, the, columbia, river, to, the, southeast, in, western, wyoming, another, divide, separates, the, columbia, watershed, from, the, colorado, green, watershed, which, empties, into, the, gulf, of, california, the, columbia, colorado, and, mississippi, watersheds, meet, at, three, waters, mountain, in, the, wind, river, range, of, wyoming, to, the, south, in, oregon, nevada, utah, idaho, and, wyoming, the, columbia, watershed, is, divided, from, the, great, basin, whose, several, watersheds, are, endorheic, not, emptying, into, any, ocean, but, rather, drying, up, or, sinking, into, sumps, great, basin, watersheds, that, share, a, border, with, the, columbia, watershed, include, harney, basin, humboldt, river, and, great, salt, lake, the, associated, triple, divide, points, are, commissary, ridge, north, wyoming, and, sproats, meadow, northwest, oregon, to, the, north, mostly, in, british, columbia, the, columbia, watershed, borders, the, fraser, river, watershed, to, the, west, and, southwest, the, columbia, watershed, borders, a, number, of, smaller, watersheds, that, drain, to, the, pacific, ocean, such, as, the, klamath, river, in, oregon, and, california, and, the, puget, sound, basin, in, washington, the, columbia, receives, more, than, 60, significant, tributaries, the, four, largest, that, empty, directly, into, the, columbia, measured, either, by, discharge, or, by, size, of, watershed, are, the, snake, river, mostly, in, idaho, the, willamette, river, in, northwest, oregon, the, kootenay, river, mostly, in, british, columbia, and, the, pend, oreille, river, mostly, in, northern, washington, and, idaho, also, known, as, the, lower, part, of, the, clark, fork, each, of, these, four, averages, more, than, 20, 000, cubic, feet, per, second, 570, m, 3, s, and, drains, an, area, of, more, than, 20, 000, square, miles, 52, 000, km, 2, the, snake, is, by, far, the, largest, tributary, its, watershed, of, 108, 000, square, miles, 280, 000, km, 2, is, larger, than, the, state, of, idaho, its, discharge, is, roughly, a, third, of, the, columbia, s, at, the, rivers, confluence, but, compared, to, the, columbia, upstream, of, the, confluence, the, snake, is, longer, 113, and, has, a, larger, drainage, basin, 104, the, pend, oreille, river, system, including, its, main, tributaries, the, clark, fork, and, flathead, rivers, is, also, similar, in, size, to, the, columbia, at, their, confluence, compared, to, the, columbia, river, above, the, two, rivers, confluence, the, pend, oreille, clark, flathead, is, nearly, as, long, about, 86, its, basin, about, three, fourths, as, large, 76, and, its, discharge, over, a, third, 37
