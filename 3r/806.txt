the, suggestion, that, barara, was, located, on, mount, entoto, is, supported, by, the, very, recent, discovery, of, a, large, medieval, town, overlooking, addis, ababa, located, between, rock, hewn, washa, mikael, and, the, more, modern, church, of, entoto, maryam, founded, in, the, late, 19th, century, dubbed, the, pentagon, the, 30, hectare, site, incorporates, a, castle, with, 12, towers,

work, on, a, church, on, mount, entoto, and, menelik, endowed, a, second, church, in, the, area, it, was, given, that, menelik, had, strong, interest, to, settle, in, the, area, due, to, a, partial, influence, of, establishing, his, old, empire, and, serving, as, a, metropolis, after, some, time, entoto, was, found, to, be, unsatisfactory, as, a, capital, because, of, its, cold, climate, lack, of, water, and, an, acute, shortage, of, firewood, in, 1886, settlement, began, in, the, valley, south, of, the, mountain, in, a, place, called, finfinne, a, name, which, refers, to, the, presence,
