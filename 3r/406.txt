https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Desert
the, kalahari, desert, is, a, large, semi, arid, sandy, savanna, in, southern, africa, extending, for, 900, 000, square, kilometres, 350, 000, sq, mi, covering, much, of, botswana, as, well, as, parts, of, namibia, and, south, africa, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, angolan, namibian, and, south, african, namib, coastal, desert, whose, name, is, of, khoekhoegowab, origin, and, means, vast, place, kalahari, is, derived, from, the, tswana, word, kgala, meaning, the, great, thirst, or, kgalagadi, meaning, a, waterless, place, the, kalahari, has, vast, areas, covered, by, red, sand, without, any, permanent, surface, water, the, kalahari, desert, was, not, always, a, dry, desert, the, fossil, flora, and, fauna, from, gcwihaba, cave, in, botswana, indicates, that, the, region, was, much, wetter, and, cooler, at, least, from, 30, to, 11, thousand, bp, before, present, especially, after, 17, 500, bp, drainage, of, the, desert, is, by, dry, black, valleys, seasonally, inundated, pans, and, the, large, salt, pans, of, the, makgadikgadi, pan, in, botswana, and, etosha, pan, in, namibia, the, only, permanent, river, the, okavango, flows, into, a, delta, in, the, northwest, forming, marshes, that, are, rich, in, wildlife, ancient, dry, riverbeds, called, omuramba, traverse, the, central, northern, reaches, of, the, kalahari, and, provide, standing, pools, of, water, during, the, rainy, season, a, semi, desert, with, huge, tracts, of, excellent, grazing, after, good, rains, the, kalahari, supports, more, animals, and, plants, than, a, true, desert, such, as, the, namib, desert, to, the, west, there, is, little, rainfall, and, the, summer, temperature, is, very, high, the, driest, areas, usually, receive, 110, 200, millimetres, 4, 3, 7, 9, in, of, rain, per, year, and, the, wettest, just, a, little, over, 500, millimetres, 20, in, the, surrounding, kalahari, basin, covers, over, 2, 500, 000, square, kilometres, 970, 000, sq, mi, extending, farther, into, botswana, namibia, and, south, africa, encroaching, into, parts, of, angola, zambia, and, zimbabwe, numerous, pans, exist, within, the, kalahari, including, the, groot, vloer, pan, and, verneukpan, where, evidence, of, a, wetter, climate, exists, in, the, form, of, former, contouring, for, capturing, water, this, and, other, pans, as, well, as, river, bottoms, were, written, about, extensively, at, sciforums, by, an, article, by, walter, wagner, regarding, the, extensive, formerly, wet, areas, of, the, kalahari, the, kalahari, is, extensive, and, extends, farther, north, where, abandoned, extensive, roadways, also, exist, the, climate, is, sub, humid, rather, than, semi, arid, in, the, north, and, east, where, the, dry, forests, savannahs, and, salt, lakes, prevail, south, and, west, where, the, vegetation, is, predominantly, xeric, savanna, or, even, a, semi, desert, the, climate, is, kalaharian, semi, arid, the, kalaharian, climate, is, subtropical, average, annual, temperature, greater, than, or, equal, to, 18, c, at, peaks, reaching, 40, c, and, above, with, mean, monthly, temperature, of, the, coldest, month, strictly, below, 18, c, and, is, semi, arid, with, the, dry, season, from, april, to, september, the, coldest, six, months, of, the, year, it, is, the, southern, tropical, equivalent, of, the, sahelian, climate, with, the, wet, season, during, summer, the, altitude, has, been, adduced, as, the, explanation, why, the, kalaharian, climate, is, not, tropical, its, altitude, ranges, from, 600, to, 1600, meters, and, generally, from, 800, to, 1200, meters, resulting, in, a, cooler, climate, than, that, of, the, sahel, or, sahara, for, example, winter, frost, is, common, from, june, to, august, rarely, seen, in, the, warmer, sahelian, regions, for, the, same, reason, summer, temperatures, certainly, can, be, very, hot, but, not, in, comparison, to, regions, of, low, altitude, in, the, sahel, or, sahara, where, some, stations, record, average, temperatures, of, the, warmest, month, around, 38, c, whereas, the, average, temperature, of, the, warmest, month, in, any, region, in, the, kalahari, never, exceeds, 29, c, though, daily, temperatures, occasionally, reach, up, to, close, to, 45, c, 113, f, 44, 8, c, at, twee, rivieren, rest, camp, in, 2012, the, dry, season, lasts, eight, months, or, more, and, the, wet, season, typically, from, less, than, one, month, to, four, months, depending, on, location, the, southwestern, kalahari, is, the, driest, area, particularly, a, small, region, toward, the, west, southwest, of, tsaraxaibis, southeast, of, namibia, the, average, annual, rainfall, ranges, from, around, 110, mm, close, to, aridity, to, more, than, 500, mm, in, some, north, and, east, areas, during, summertime, in, all, regions, rainfall, may, go, with, heavy, thunderstorms, in, the, driest, and, sunniest, parts, of, the, kalahari, over, 4, 000, hours, of, sunshine, are, recorded, annually, on, average, in, the, kalahari, there, are, three, main, mechanisms, of, atmospheric, circulation, dominated, by, the, kalahari, high, anticyclone, in, winter, and, by, the, kalahari, heat, low, in, summer, there, are, huge, subterranean, water, reserves, beneath, parts, of, the, kalahari, the, dragon, s, breath, cave, for, example, is, the, largest, documented, non, subglacial, underground, lake, such, reserves, may, partly, be, the, residues, of, ancient, lakes, the, kalahari, desert, was, once, a, much, wetter, place, the, ancient, lake, makgadikgadi, dominated, the, area, covering, the, makgadikgadi, pan, and, surrounding, areas, but, it, drained, or, dried, out, some, 10, 000, years, ago, it, may, have, once, covered, as, much, as, 120, 000, square, kilometres, 46, 000, sq, mi, in, ancient, times, there, was, sufficient, moisture, for, farming, with, dikes, and, dams, collecting, the, water, these, are, now, filled, with, sediment, breached, or, no, longer, in, use, though, they, can, be, readily, seen, via, google, earth, the, kalahari, has, had, a, complex, climatic, history, over, the, past, million, or, so, years, in, line, with, major, global, changes, changes, in, the, last, 250, 000, years, have, been, reconstructed, from, various, data, sources, providing, evidence, of, former, extensive, lakes, and, drier, periods, during, the, latter, the, area, of, the, kalahari, has, expanded, to, include, parts, of, western, zimbabwe, zambia, and, angola, due, to, its, low, aridity, the, kalahari, supports, a, variety, of, flora, the, native, flora, includes, acacia, trees, and, many, other, herbs, and, grasses, the, kiwano, fruit, also, known, as, the, horned, melon, melano, african, horned, cucumber, jelly, melon, or, hedged, gourd, is, endemic, to, a, region, in, the, kalahari, desert, specific, region, unknown, even, where, the, kalahari, desert, is, dry, enough, to, qualify, as, a, desert, in, the, sense, of, having, low, precipitation, it, is, not, strictly, speaking, a, desert, because, it, has, too, dense, a, ground, cover, the, main, region, that, lacks, ground, cover, is, in, the, southwest, kalahari, southeast, of, namibia, northwest, of, south, africa, and, southwest, of, botswana, in, the, south, of, the, kgalagadi, transfrontier, park, for, instance, in, the, zf, mgcawu, district, municipality, of, south, africa, total, vegetation, cover, may, be, as, low, as, 30, 72, on, non, protected, from, cattle, grazing, farmlands, south, of, twee, rivieren, rest, camp, and, 37, 74, in, the, protected, from, cattle, grazing, south, african, side, of, the, kgalagadi, transfrontier, park, these, southernmost, kalahari, xeric, savanna, areas, are, truly, semi, deserts, however, in, all, the, remaining, kalahari, except, on, salt, pans, during, the, dry, season, the, vegetation, cover, can, be, denser, up, to, almost, 100, in, some, limited, areas, in, an, area, of, about, 600, 000, km, 2, in, the, south, and, west, of, the, kalahari, the, vegetation, is, mainly, xeric, savanna, this, area, is, the, ecoregion, identified, by, world, wide, fund, for, nature, as, kalahari, xeric, savanna, at1309, typical, savanna, grasses, include, schmidtia, stipagrostis, aristida, and, eragrostis, these, are, interspersed, with, trees, such, as, camelthorn, acacia, erioloba, grey, camelthorn, acacia, haematoxylon, shepherd, s, tree, boscia, albitrunca, blackthorn, acacia, mellifera, and, silver, cluster, leaf, terminalia, sericea, in, certain, areas, where, the, climate, is, drier, it, becomes, a, true, semi, desert, with, ground, not, entirely, covered, by, vegetation, open, as, opposed, to, closed, vegetation, examples, include, the, north, of, the, zf, mgcawu, district, municipality, itself, in, the, north, of, south, africa, and, the, keetmanshoop, rural, in, the, southeast, of, namibia, in, the, north, and, east, dry, forests, cover, an, area, of, over, 300, 000, km, 2, in, which, rhodesian, teak, and, several, species, of, acacia, are, prominent, these, regions, are, termed, kalahari, acacia, baikiaea, woodlands, at0709, outside, the, kalahari, desert, but, in, the, kalahari, basin, halophytic, vegetation, to, the, north, is, adapted, to, pans, lakes, that, are, completely, dry, during, the, dry, season, and, maybe, for, years, during, droughts, such, as, in, etosha, etosha, pan, halophytics, at0902, and, makgadikgadi, zambezian, halophytics, at0908, a, totally, different, vegetation, is, adapted, to, the, perennial, fresh, water, of, the, okavango, delta, an, ecoregion, termed, zambezian, flooded, grasslands, at0907, the, kalahari, is, home, to, many, migratory, birds, and, animals, previously, havens, for, wild, animals, from, elephants, to, giraffes, and, for, predators, such, as, lions, and, cheetahs, the, riverbeds, are, now, mostly, grazing, spots, however, leopards, and, cheetahs, can, still, be, found, the, area, is, now, heavily, grazed, and, cattle, fences, restrict, wildlife, movement, among, deserts, of, the, southern, hemisphere, the, kalahari, most, closely, resembles, some, australian, deserts, in, its, latitude, and, mode, of, formation, although, there, are, few, endemic, species, a, wide, variety, of, species, are, found, in, the, region, including, large, predators, such, as, the, lion, panthera, leo, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, leopard, panthera, pardus, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, brown, hyena, parahyaena, brunnea, and, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, pictus, birds, of, prey, include, the, secretarybird, sagittarius, serpentarius, martial, eagle, polemaetus, bellicosus, and, other, eagles, the, giant, eagle, owl, bubo, lacteus, and, other, owls, falcons, goshawks, kestrels, and, kites, other, animals, include, wildebeest, springbok, gemsbok, and, other, antelopes, cape, porcupines, hystrix, africaeaustralis, and, ostriches, struthio, camelus, some, of, the, areas, within, the, kalahari, are, seasonal, wetlands, such, as, the, makgadikgadi, pans, of, botswana, this, area, for, example, supports, numerous, halophilic, species, and, in, the, rainy, season, tens, of, thousands, of, flamingos, visit, these, pans, the, biggest, threat, to, wildlife, are, the, fences, erected, to, manage, herds, of, grazing, cattle, which, also, removes, the, plant, cover, of, the, savanna, itself, cattle, ranchers, will, also, poison, or, hunt, down, predators, from, the, rangeland, particularly, targeting, jackals, and, wild, dogs, the, following, protected, areas, were, established, in, the, kalahari, the, san, people, have, lived, in, the, kalahari, for, 20, 000, years, as, hunter, gatherers, they, hunt, wild, game, with, bows, and, poisoned, arrows, and, gather, edible, plants, such, as, berries, melons, and, nuts, as, well, as, insects, the, san, get, most, of, their, water, requirements, from, plant, roots, and, desert, melons, found, on, or, under, the, desert, floor, they, often, store, water, in, the, blown, out, shells, of, ostrich, eggs, the, san, live, in, huts, built, from, local, materials, the, frame, is, made, of, branches, and, the, roof, is, thatched, with, long, grass, most, of, their, hunting, and, gathering, techniques, replicate, pre, historic, tribes, bantu, speaking, tswana, kgalagadi, and, herero, and, a, small, number, of, european, settlers, also, live, in, the, kalahari, desert, the, city, of, windhoek, is, situated, in, the, kalahari, basin, in, 1996, de, beers, evaluated, the, potential, of, diamond, mining, at, gope, in, 1997, the, eviction, of, the, san, and, bakgalagadi, tribes, in, the, central, kalahari, game, reserve, from, their, land, began, in, 2006, a, botswana, high, court, ruled, in, favor, of, the, san, and, bakgalagadi, tribes, in, the, reserve, finding, their, eviction, unlawful, the, government, of, botswana, granted, a, permit, to, de, beers, gem, diamonds, gope, exploration, company, pty, ltd, to,
