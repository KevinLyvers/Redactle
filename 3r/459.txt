communities, of, ironworkers, and, bantu, subsistence, farmers, hunters, and, fishers, who, supported, the, economy, with, agriculture, fishing, metal, production, and, trade, with, foreign, countries, these, communities, formed, the, earliest, city, states, in, the, region, which, were, collectively, known, as, azania, by, the, 1st, century, ce, many, of, the, city, states, such, as, mombasa, malindi, and, zanzibar, began, to, establish, trading, relations, with, arabs, this, led, to, the, increased, economic, growth, of, the, swahili, states, the, introduction, of, islam, arabic, influences, on, the, swahili, bantu, language, cultural, diffusion, as, well, as, the, swahili, city, states, becoming, members, of, a, larger, trade, network, many, historians, had, long, believed, that, the, city, states, were, established, by, arab, or, persian, traders, but, archaeological, evidence, has, led, scholars, to, recognise, the, city, states, as, an, indigenous, development, which, though, subjected, to, foreign, influence, due, to, trade, retained, a, bantu, cultural, core, dna, evidence, has, found, that, the, swahili, people, were, of, mixed, african, and, asian, particularly, persian, ancestry, the, kilwa, sultanate, was, a, medieval, sultanate, centred, at, kilwa, in, modern, day, tanzania, at, its, height, its, authority, stretched, over, the, entire, length, of, the, swahili, coast, including, kenya, since, the, 10th, century, rulers, of, kilwa, would, go, on, to, build, elaborate, coral, mosques, and, introduce, copper, coinage, swahili, a, bantu, language, with, arabic, persian, and, other, middle, eastern, and, south, asian, loanwords, later, developed, as, a, lingua, franca, for, trade, between, the, different, peoples, since, the,

a, major, port, city, and, established, trade, links, with, other, nearby, city, states, as, well, as, commercial, centres, in, persia, arabia, and, even, india, by, the, 15th, century, portuguese, voyager, duarte, barbosa, claimed, that, mombasa, is, a, place, of, great, traffic, and, has, a, good, harbour, in, which, there, are, always, moored, small, craft, of, many, kinds, and, also, great, ships, both, of, which, are, bound, from, sofala, and, others, which, come, from, cambay, and, melinde, and, others, which, sail, to, the, island, of, zanzibar, in, the, 17th, century, the, swahili, coast, was, conquered, and, came, under, the, direct, rule, of, the, omani, arabs, who, expanded, the, slave, trade, to, meet, the, demands, of, plantations, in, oman, and, zanzibar, initially, these, traders, came, mainly, from, oman, but, later, many, came, from, zanzibar, such, as, tippu, tip, in, addition, the, portuguese, started, buying, slaves, from, the, omani, and, zanzibari, traders, in, response, to, the, interruption, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, by, british, abolitionists, throughout, the, centuries, the, kenyan, coast, has, played, host, to, many, merchants, and, explorers, among, the, cities, that, line, the, kenyan, coast, is, malindi, it, has, remained, an, important, swahili, settlement, since, the, 14th, century, and, once, rivalled, mombasa, for, dominance, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, malindi, has, traditionally, been, a, friendly, port, city, for, foreign, powers, in, 1414, the, chinese, trader, and, explorer, zheng, he, representing, the, ming, dynasty, visited, the, east, african, coast, on, one, of, his, last, treasure, voyages, malindi, authorities, also, welcomed, the, portuguese, explorer, vasco, da, gama, in, 1498, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, c, e, the, masai, people, moved, into, central, and, southern, rift, valley, plains, of, kenya, from, a, region, north, of, lake, rudolf, now, lake, turkana, although, there, were, not, many, they, managed, to, conquer, a, great, amount, of, land, in, the, plains, where, people, did, not, put, up, much, resistance, the, nandi, peoples, managed, to, oppose, the, masai, while, the, taveta, peoples, fled, to, the, forests, on, the, eastern, edge, of, mount, kilimanjaro, although, they, later, were, forced, to, leave, the, land, due, to, the, threat, of, smallpox, an, outbreak, of, either, rinderpest, or, pleuropneumonia, greatly, affected, the, masai, s, cattle, while, an, epidemic, of, smallpox, affected, the, masai, themselves, after, the, death, of, the, masai, mbatian, the, chief, laibon, medicine, man, the, masai, split, into, warring, factions, the, masai, caused, much, strife, in, the, areas, they, conquered, however, cooperation, between, such, groups, as, the, luo, people, luhya, people, and, gusii, people, is, evidenced, by, shared, vocabulary, for, modern, implements, and, similar, economic, regimes, although, arab, traders, remained, in, the, area, trade, routes, were, disrupted, by, the, hostile, masai, though, there, was, trade, in, ivory, between, these, factions, the, first, foreigners, to, successfully, get, past, the, masai, were, johann, ludwig, krapf, and, johannes, rebmann, two, german, missionaries, who, established, a, mission, in, rabai, not, too, far, from, mombasa, the, pair, were, the, first, europeans, to, sight, mount, kenya, the, colonial, history, of, kenya, dates, from, the, establishment, of, a, german, empire, protectorate, over, the, sultan, of, zanzibar, s,

the, country, the, building, of, the, railway, was, resisted, by, some, ethnic, groups, notably, the, nandi, led, by, orkoiyot, koitalel, arap, samoei, from, 1890, to, 1900, but, the, british, eventually, built, it, the, nandi, were, the, first, ethnic, group, to, be, put, in, a, native, reserve, to, stop, them, from, disrupting, the, building, of, the, railway, during, the, railway, construction, era, there, was, a, significant, influx, of, indian, workers, who, provided, the, bulk, of, the, skilled, labour, required, for, construction, they, and, most, of, their, descendants, later, remained, in, kenya, and, formed, the, core, of, several, distinct, indian, communities, such, as, the, ismaili, muslim, and, sikh, communities, while, building, the, railway, through, tsavo, a, number, of, the, indian, railway, workers, and, local, african, labourers, were, attacked, by, two, lions, known, as, the, tsavo, maneaters, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, august, 1914,

democratic, republic, whereby, the, president, of, kenya, is, both, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, and, of, a, multi, party, system, the, new, constitution, also, states, that, executive,

is, vested, exclusively, in, parliament, the, judiciary, is, independent, of, the, executive, and, the, legislature, after, kibaki, s, tenure, ended, in, 2013, kenya, held, its, first, general,

odinga, again, petitioned, the, results, in, the, supreme, court, accusing, the, independent, electoral, and, boundaries, commission, of, mismanagement, of, the, elections, and, kenyatta, and, his, party, of, rigging, the, supreme, court, overturned, the, election, results, in, what, became, a, landmark, ruling, in, africa, and, one, of, the, very, few, in, the, world, in, which, the, results, of, a, presidential, elections, were, annulled, this, ruling, solidified, the, position, of, the, supreme, court, as, an, independent, body, consequently, kenya, had, a, second, round, of, elections, for, the, presidential, position, in, which, kenyatta, emerged, the, winner, after, odinga, refused, to, participate, citing, irregularities, in, march, 2018, a, historic, handshake, between,

critics, saw, this, as, an, unnecessary, attempt, to, reward, political, dynasties, and, blunt, the, efforts, of, deputy, president, willian, ruto, odinga, s, rival, for, the, next, presidency, and, bloat, the, government, at, an, exceptional, cost, to, the, debt, laded, country, ultimately, in, may, 2021, the, kenyan, high, court, ruled, that, the, bbi, constitutional, reform, effort, was, unconstitutional, because, it, was, not, truly, a, popular, initiative, but, rather, an, effort, of, the, government, the, court, sharply, criticized, kenyatta, for, the, attempt, laying, out, grounds, for, his, being, sued, personally, or, even, impeached, though, the, parliament, which, had, passed, the, bbi, was, unlikely, to, do, that, the, ruling, was, seen, as, a, major, defeat, for, both, kenyatta, soon, to, leave, office, and, odinga, expected, to, seek, the, presidency, but, a, boon, to, odinga, s, future, presidential, election, rival, ruto, on, 20, august, 2021, kenya, s,
