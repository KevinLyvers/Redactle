tasked, with, enforcing, the, act, and, thomas, hutchinson, then, the, lieutenant, governor, of, massachusetts, the, british, sent, two, regiments, to, boston, in, 1768, in, an, attempt, to, quell, the, angry, colonists, this, did, not, sit, well, with, the, colonists, however, in, 1770, during, the, boston, massacre, british, troops, shot, into, a, crowd, that, had, started, to, violently,

passed, the, tea, act, many, of, the, colonists, saw, the, act, as, an, attempt, to, force, them, to, accept, the, taxes, established, by, the, townshend, acts, the, act, prompted, the, boston, tea, party, where, a, group, of, angered, bostonians, threw, an, entire, shipment, of, tea, sent, by, the, east, india, company, into, boston, harbor, the, boston, tea, party, was, a, key, event, leading, up, to, the, revolution, as, the, british, government, responded, furiously, with, the, coercive, acts, demanding, compensation, for, the, destroyed, tea, from, the, bostonians, this, angered, the, colonists, further, and, led, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, war, began, in, the, area, surrounding, boston, with, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, boston, itself, was, besieged, for, almost, a, year, during, the, siege, of, boston, which, began, on, april, 19, 1775, the, new, england, militia, impeded, the, movement, of, the, british, army, sir, william, howe, then, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, forces, in, north, america, led, the, british, army, in, the, siege, on, june, 17, the, british, captured, charlestown, now, part, of, boston, during, the, battle, of, bunker, hill, the, british, army, outnumbered, the, militia, stationed, there, but, it, was, a, pyrrhic, victory, for, the, british, because, their, army, suffered, irreplaceable, casualties, it, was, also, a, testament, to, the, skill, and, training, of, the, militia, as, their, stubborn, defense, made, it, difficult, for, the, british, to, capture, charlestown, without, suffering, further, irreplaceable, casualties, several, weeks, later, george, washington, took, over, the, militia, after, the, continental, congress, established, the, continental, army, to, unify, the, revolutionary, effort, both, sides, faced, difficulties, and, supply, shortages, in, the, siege, and, the, fighting, was, limited, to, small, scale, raids, and, skirmishes, the, narrow, boston, neck, which, at, that, time, was, only, about, a, hundred, feet, wide, impeded, washington, s, ability, to, invade, boston, and, a, long, stalemate, ensued, a, young, officer, rufus, putnam, came, up, with, a, plan, to, make, portable, fortifications, out, of, wood, that, could, be, erected, on, the, frozen, ground, under, cover, of, darkness, putnam, supervised, this, effort, which, successfully, installed, both, the, fortifications, and, dozens, of, cannons, on, dorchester, heights, that, henry, knox, had, laboriously, brought, through, the, snow, from, fort, ticonderoga, the, astonished, british, awoke, the, next, morning, to, see, a, large, array, of, cannons, bearing, down, on, them, general, howe, is, believed, to, have, said, that, the, americans, had, done, more, in, one, night, than, his, army, could, have, done, in, six, months, the, british, army, attempted, a, cannon, barrage, for, two, hours, but, their, shot, could, not, reach, the, colonists, cannons, at, such, a, height, the, british, gave, up, boarded, their, ships, and, sailed, away, this, has, become, known, as, evacuation, day, which, boston, still, celebrates, each, year, on, march, 17, after, this, washington, was, so, impressed, that, he, made, rufus, putnam, his, chief, engineer, after, the, revolution, boston, s, long, seafaring, tradition, helped, make, it, one, of, the, nation, s, busiest, ports, for, both, domestic, and, international, trade, boston, s, harbor, activity, was, significantly, curtailed, by, the, embargo, act, of, 1807, adopted, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, war, of, 1812, foreign, trade, returned, after, these, hostilities, but, boston, s, merchants, had, found, alternatives, for, their, capital, investments, in, the, meantime, manufacturing, became, an, important, component, of, the, city, s, economy, and, the, city, s, industrial, manufacturing, overtook, international, trade, in, economic, importance, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, small, rivers, bordering, the, city, and, connecting, it, to, the, surrounding, region, facilitated, shipment, of, goods, and, led, to, a, proliferation, of, mills, and, factories, later, a, dense, network, of, railroads, furthered, the, region, s, industry, and, commerce, during, this, period, boston, flourished, culturally, as, well, it, was, admired, for, its, rarefied, literary, life, and, generous,
