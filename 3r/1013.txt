of, the, original, material, was, used, originally, built, in, romanesque, style, in, 1015, the, next, chapter, in, the, history, of, human, architecture, is, renaissance, architecture, one, of, the, earliest, places, to, be, influenced, by, the, renaissance, style, of, architecture, was, hungary, and, budapest, in, particular, the, style, appeared, following, the, marriage, of, king, matthias, corvinus, and, beatrice, of, naples, in, 1476, many, italian, artists, craftsmen, and, masons, came, to, buda, with, the, new, queen, today, many, of, the, original, renaissance, buildings,

cultures, converged, in, hungary, seemed, to, coalesce, well, with, each, other, as, if, all, these, different, cultures, and, architecture, styles, are, digested, into, hungary, s, own, way, of, cultural, blend, a, precedent, to, show, the, city, s, self, conscious, is, the, top, section, of, the, city, s, main, square, named, as, szechenyi, when, turks, came, to, the, city, they, built, mosques, here, which, was, aggressively, replaced, with, gothic, church, of, st, bertalan, the, rationale, of, reusing, the, base, of, the, former, islamic, building, mosque, and, reconstruction, into, gothic, church, but, islamic, style, architecture, over, it, is, typically, islamic, are, still, visible, an, official, term, for, the, rationale, is, spolia, the, mosque, was, called, the, djami, of, pasha, gazi, kassim, and, djami, means, mosque, in, arabic, after, turks, and, muslims, were, expelled, and, massacred, from, budapest, the, site, was, reoccupied, by, christians, and, reformed, into, a, church, the, inner, city, parish, church, budapest, the, minaret, and, turkish, entranceway, were, removed, the, shape, of, the, architecture, is, its, only, hint, of, exotic, past,

towns, and, villages, this, only, came, about, however, after, the, rise, of, state, communism, in, hungary, in, 1950, for, reasons, of, social, and, industrial, policy, including, the, hungarian, working, people, s, party, s, desire, to, proletarianize, the, traditionally, right, wing, suburbs, 7, cities, with, county, rights, and, 16, towns, were, annexed, to, the, capital, to, form,

part, of, buda, and, includes, the, former, buda, district, iv, continues, this, semicircle, in, northernmost, pest, but, the, v, district, is, in, the, very, center, of, pest, and, inaugurates, a, new, circle, that, then, loops, back, through, pest, to, buda, as, the, vi, vii, viii, ix, xi, and, xii, districts, districts, xiii, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxi, and, xxii, form, yet,
