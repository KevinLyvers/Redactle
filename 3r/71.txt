the, andaman, sea, historically, also, known, as, the, burma, sea, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, northeastern, indian, ocean, bounded, by, the, coastlines, of, myanmar, and, thailand, along, the, gulf, of, martaban, and, the, west, side, of, the, malay, peninsula, and, separated, from, the, bay, of, bengal, to, its, west, by, the, andaman, islands, and, the, nicobar, islands, its, southern, end, is, at, breueh, island, just, north, of, sumatra, with, the, strait, of, malacca, further, southeast, traditionally, the, sea, has, been, used, for, fishery, and, transportation, of, goods, between, the, coastal, countries, and, its, coral, reefs, and, islands, are, popular, tourist, destinations, the, fishery, and, tourist, infrastructure, was, severely, damaged, by, the, december, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, and, tsunami, the, andaman, sea, which, extends, over, 92, e, to, 100, e, and, 4, n, to, 20, n, occupies, a, very, significant, position, in, the, indian, ocean, yet, remained, unexplored, for, a, long, period, to, the, south, of, myanmar, west, of, thailand, and, north, of, indonesia, this, sea, is, separated, from, the, bay, of, bengal, by, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, and, an, associated, chain, of, sea, mounts, along, the, indo, burmese, plate, boundary, the, strait, of, malacca, between, the, malay, peninsula, and, sumatra, forms, the, southern, exitway, of, the, basin, which, is, 3, kilometres, 1, 9, mi, wide, and, 37, metres, 121, ft, deep, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, andaman, or, burma, sea, as, follows, p, 21, on, the, southwest, a, line, running, from, oedjong, raja, 5, 32, n, 95, 12, e, 5, 533, n, 95, 200, e, 5, 533, 95, 200, in, sumatra, to, poeloe, bras, breu, h, and, on, through, the, western, islands, of, the, nicobar, group, to, sandy, point, in, little, andaman, island, in, such, a, way, that, all, the, narrow, waters, appertain, to, the, burma, sea, on, the, northwest, the, eastern, limit, of, the, bay, of, bengal, through, the, larger, islands, of, the, andaman, group, in, such, a, way, that, all, the, narrow, waters, between, the, islands, lie, to, the, eastward, of, the, line, and, are, excluded, from, the, bay, of, bengal, as, far, as, a, point, in, little, andaman, island, in, latitude, 10, 48, n, longitude, 92, 24, e, on, the, southeast, a, line, joining, lem, voalan, 7, 47, n, in, siam, and, pedropunt, 5, 40, n, in, sumatra, oedjong, means, cape, and, lem, means, point, in, the, dutch, language, on, maps, of, the, netherlands, east, indies, indonesia, lem, voalan, is, the, southern, extremity, of, goh, puket, phuket, island, exclusive, economic, zones, in, andaman, sea, the, northern, and, eastern, side, of, the, basin, is, shallow, as, the, continental, shelf, off, the, coast, of, myanmar, and, thailand, extends, over, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, marked, by, 300, metres, 980, ft, isobath, about, 45, percent, of, the, basin, area, is, shallower, less, than, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, depth, which, is, the, direct, consequence, of, the, presence, of, the, wider, shelf, the, continental, slope, which, follows, the, eastern, shelf, is, quite, steep, between, 9, n, and, 14, n, here, the, perspective, view, of, the, submarine, topography, sectioned, along, 95, e, exposes, the, abrupt, rise, in, depth, of, sea, by, about, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, within, a, short, horizontal, distance, of, a, degree, isobaths, corresponding, to, 900, and, 2, 000, metres, 3, 000, and, 6, 600, ft, are, also, shown, in, the, figure, to, emphasize, the, steepness, of, the, slope, further, it, may, be, noted, that, the, deep, ocean, is, also, not, free, from, sea, mounts, hence, only, around, 15, percent, of, the, total, area, is, deeper, than, 2, 500, metres, 8, 200, ft, the, northern, and, eastern, parts, are, shallower, than, 180, meters, 590, feet, due, to, the, silt, deposited, by, the, irrawaddy, river, this, major, river, flows, into, the, sea, from, the, north, through, myanmar, the, western, and, central, areas, are, 900, 3, 000, meters, 3, 000, 9, 800, ft, deep, less, than, 5, of, the, sea, is, deeper, than, 3, 000, meters, 9, 800, feet, and, in, a, system, of, submarine, valleys, east, of, the, andaman, nicobar, ridge, the, depth, exceeds, 4, 000, meters, 13, 000, feet, the, sea, floor, is, covered, with, pebbles, gravel, and, sand, the, western, boundary, of, the, andaman, sea, is, marked, by, volcanic, islands, and, sea, mounts, with, straits, or, passages, of, variable, depths, that, control, the, entry, and, exit, of, water, to, the, bay, of, bengal, there, is, a, drastic, change, in, water, depth, over, a, short, distance, of, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, as, one, moves, from, the, bay, of, bengal, around, 3, 500, metres, 11, 500, ft, deep, to, the, vicinity, of, islands, up, to, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, depth, and, further, into, the, andaman, sea, water, is, exchanged, between, the, andaman, sea, and, the, bay, of, bengal, through, the, straits, between, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, out, of, these, the, most, important, straits, in, terms, of, width, and, depth, are, preparis, channel, pc, ten, degree, channel, tdc, and, great, channel, gc, pc, is, the, widest, but, shallowest, 250, metres, 820, ft, of, the, three, and, separates, south, myanmar, from, north, andaman, tdc, is, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, deep, and, lies, between, little, andaman, and, car, nicobar, gc, is, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, deep, and, separates, great, nicobar, from, banda, aceh, running, in, a, rough, north, south, line, on, the, seabed, of, the, andaman, sea, is, the, boundary, between, two, tectonic, plates, the, burma, plate, and, the, sunda, plate, these, plates, or, microplates, are, believed, to, have, formerly, been, part, of, the, larger, eurasian, plate, but, were, formed, when, transform, fault, activity, intensified, as, the, indian, plate, began, its, substantive, collision, with, the, eurasian, continent, as, a, result, a, back, arc, basin, center, was, created, which, began, to, form, the, marginal, basin, which, would, become, the, andaman, sea, the, current, stages, of, which, commenced, approximately, 3, 4, million, years, ago, ma, the, boundary, between, two, major, tectonic, plates, results, in, high, seismic, activity, in, the, region, see, list, of, earthquakes, in, indonesia, numerous, earthquakes, have, been, recorded, and, at, least, six, in, 1797, 1833, 1861, 2004, 2005, and, 2007, had, a, magnitude, of, 8, 4, or, higher, on, 26, december, 2004, a, large, portion, of, the, boundary, between, the, burma, plate, and, the, indo, australian, plate, slipped, causing, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, this, megathrust, earthquake, had, a, magnitude, of, 9, 3, between, 1, 300, and, 1, 600, kilometres, 810, and, 990, mi, of, the, boundary, underwent, thrust, faulting, and, shifted, by, about, 20, metres, 66, ft, with, the, sea, floor, being, uplifted, several, meters, this, rise, in, the, sea, floor, generated, a, massive, tsunami, with, an, estimated, height, of, 28, meters, 92, feet, that, killed, approximately, 280, 000, people, along, the, coast, of, the, indian, ocean, the, initial, quake, was, followed, by, a, series, of, aftershocks, along, the, arc, of, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, the, entire, event, severely, damaged, the, fishing, infrastructure, 40, 42, within, the, sea, to, the, east, of, the, main, great, andaman, island, group, lies, barren, island, the, only, currently, active, volcano, associated, with, the, indian, subcontinent, this, island, volcano, is, 3, km, 2, mi, in, diameter, and, rises, 354, metres, 1, 161, ft, above, sea, level, its, recent, activity, resumed, in, 1991, after, a, quiet, period, of, almost, 200, years, it, is, caused, by, the, ongoing, subduction, of, the, india, plate, beneath, the, andaman, island, arc, which, forces, magma, to, rise, in, this, location, of, the, burma, plate, the, last, eruption, started, on, 13, may, 2008, and, continues, the, volcanic, island, of, narcondam, which, lies, further, north, was, also, formed, by, this, process, no, records, exist, of, its, activity, collectively, the, modern, ayeyarwady, irrawaddy, and, thanlwin, salween, rivers, deliver, 600, mt, yr, of, sediment, to, the, sea, most, recent, studies, show, 1, there, is, little, modern, sediment, accumulating, on, the, shelf, immediately, off, the, ayeyarwady, river, mouths, in, contrast, a, major, mud, wedge, with, a, distal, depocenter, up, to, 60, metres, 200, ft, in, thickness, has, been, deposited, seaward, in, the, gulf, of, martaban, extending, to, approximately, 130, metres, 430, ft, water, depth, into, the, martaban, depression, further, 2, there, is, no, evidence, showing, that, modern, sediment, has, accumulated, or, is, transported, into, the, martaban, canyon, 3, a, mud, drape, blanket, is, wrapping, around, the, narrow, western, myanmar, shelf, in, the, eastern, bay, of, bengal, the, thickness, of, the, mud, deposit, is, up, to, 20, metres, 66, ft, nearshore, and, gradually, thins, to, the, slope, at, 300, metres, 980, ft, water, depth, and, likely, escapes, into, the, deep, andaman, trench, 4, the, estimated, total, amount, of, holocene, sediments, deposited, offshore, is, approximately, 1, 290, by, 109, tonnes, 1, 270, by, 107, long, tons, 1, 422, by, 120, short, tons, if, we, assume, this, has, mainly, accumulated, since, the, middle, holocene, highstand, 6000, yr, bp, like, other, major, deltas, the, historical, annual, mean, depositional, flux, on, the, shelf, would, be, 215, megatonnes, 212, 000, 000, long, tons, 237, 000, 000, short, tons, per, year, which, is, equivalent, to, 35, of, the, modern, ayeyarwady, thanlwin, rivers, derived, sediments, 5, unlike, other, large, river, systems, in, asia, such, as, the, yangtze, and, mekong, this, study, indicates, a, bi, directional, transport, and, depositional, pattern, controlled, by, the, local, currents, that, are, influenced, by, tides, and, seasonally, varying, monsoons, winds, and, waves, the, climate, of, the, andaman, sea, is, determined, by, the, monsoons, of, southeast, asia, as, the, prevailing, winds, reverse, with, the, start, of, either, season, the, region, experiences, north, easterlies, with, an, average, windspeed, of, 5, m, s, 18, km, h, from, november, to, february, during, these, months, the, western, part, of, the, domain, experiences, maximum, wind, intensity, it, weakens, by, march, april, and, reverses, to, strong, south, westerlies, from, may, to, september, with, mean, wind, speeds, touching, 8, m, s, 29, km, h, in, june, july, and, august, distributed, near, uniformly, over, the, entire, basin, wind, speeds, plummet, by, october, and, switch, back, to, north, easterlies, from, november, air, temperature, is, stable, over, the, year, at, 26, c, 79, f, in, february, and, 27, c, 81, f, in, august, precipitation, is, as, high, as, 3, 000, millimetres, 120, in, year, and, mostly, occurs, in, summer, sea, currents, are, south, easterly, and, easterly, in, winter, and, south, westerly, and, westerly, in, summer, the, average, surface, water, temperature, is, 26, 28, c, 79, 82, f, in, february, and, 29, c, 84, f, in, may, the, water, temperature, is, constant, at, 4, 8, c, 40, 6, f, at, the, depths, of, 1, 600, metres, 5, 200, ft, and, below, salinity, is, 31, 5, 32, 5, parts, per, thousand, in, summer, and, 30, 0, 33, 0, in, winter, in, the, southern, part, in, the, northern, part, it, decreases, to, 20, 25, due, to, the, inflow, of, freshwater, from, the, irrawaddy, river, tides, are, semidiurnal, with, an, amplitude, of, up, to, 7, 2, metres, 24, ft, the, effect, of, wind, stress, on, the, ocean, surface, can, be, explained, by, wind, stress, curl, the, net, divergence, of, water, in, the, ocean, mixed, layer, results, in, ekman, pumping, the, contrast, between, the, two, seasons, elicits, a, very, strong, negative, pumping, velocity, of, more, than, 5, m, 16, ft, per, day, along, the, north, coast, of, indonesia, from, may, to, september, shown, here, june, this, may, signify, coastal, downwelling, in, the, summer, it, is, also, observed, that, the, region, develops, a, weak, but, positive, pumping, velocity, of, less, than, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, per, day, at, the, mouth, of, gc, in, winter, here, december, generally, currents, are, found, to, be, stronger, in, the, south, than, any, other, part, of, the, basin, an, intense, surface, outflux, through, gc, of, the, order, of, 40, cm, s, 16, in, s, occurs, during, summers, and, winters, while, this, flow, is, directed, westwards, in, winter, it, is, southwards, along, the, west, coast, of, indonesia, in, summer, on, the, other, hand, the, tdc, has, strong, surface, influx, in, summer, which, weakens, by, october, this, is, followed, by, a, sturdy, outflux, in, winter, which, wanes, by, the, month, of, april, although, the, surface, flow, through, pc, is, generally, inward, during, summer, monsoon, the, preceding, and, succeeding, months, experience, outflow, strong, outflow, in, october, but, weak, outflow, in, april, during, april, and, october, when, the, effects, of, local, winds, are, minimal, andaman, sea, experiences, the, intensification, of, meridional, surface, currents, in, the, poleward, direction, along, the, continental, slope, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, basin, this, is, characteristic, of, the, propagation, of, kelvin, waves, it, is, observed, that, the, water, level, rises, in, the, basin, between, april, and, november, with, the, maximum, rate, of, piling, up, of, water, during, april, and, october, marked, by, the, steep, slope, of, the, curve, the, rise, in, sea, surface, height, ssh, is, attributed, to, rainfall, fresh, water, influx, from, rivers, and, inflow, of, water, through, the, three, major, straits, the, first, two, of, these, are, quantifiable, and, are, hence, expressed, in, volumes, of, water, for, comparison, from, this, the, expected, influx, through, the, straits, ssh, anomaly, rainfall, river, influx, could, be, deduced, a, possible, fourth, factor, evaporative, losses, is, negligible, in, comparison, previous, studies, show, that, the, annual, mean, freshwater, gain, precipitation, minus, evaporation, of, the, andaman, sea, is, 120, centimetres, 47, in, per, year, it, is, found, that, the, ssh, of, the, basin, is, primarily, determined, by, the, transport, of, water, through, the, straits, the, contributions, from, rainfall, and, rivers, become, substantial, only, during, summer, hence, a, net, inward, flow, occurs, through, the, straits, between, april, and, november, followed, by, a, net, outward, transport, until, march, the, basin, has, a, very, high, rate, of, transport, of, water, through, the, straits, in, april, and, october, this, is, a, period, of, equatorial, wyrtki, jets, which, hit, the, coast, of, sumatra, and, reflect, back, as, rossby, waves, and, coastal, kelvin, waves, these, kelvin, waves, are, guided, along, the, eastern, boundary, of, indian, ocean, and, a, part, of, this, signal, propagates, into, the, andaman, sea, the, northern, coast, of, sumatra, is, the, first, to, be, affected, the, 20, c, 68, f, isotherm, which, deepens, during, the, same, period, is, suggestive, of, the, downwelling, nature, of, kelvin, waves, the, waves, further, propagate, along, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, andaman, sea, which, is, confirmed, by, the, differential, deepening, of, the, 20, degree, isotherm, along, longitudes, 94, e, and, 97, e, averaged, over, latitudes, 8, n, and, 13, n, these, longitudes, are, chosen, so, that, one, represents, the, western, part, of, the, basin, 94, e, and, the, other, along, the, steep, continental, slope, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, basin, 97, e, it, is, observed, that, both, these, longitudes, experience, deepening, of, the, isotherms, in, april, and, october, but, the, effect, is, more, pronounced, at, 97, e, isotherms, deepen, by, 30, metres, 98, ft, in, april, and, 10, metres, 33, ft, in, october, this, is, a, concrete, signature, of, downwelling, in, the, basin, and, is, definitely, not, forced, locally, as, the, winds, are, weaker, during, this, period, this, confirms, unequivocally, that, the, sudden, burst, of, water, into, the, basin, through, the, straits, the, intensification, of, eastern, boundary, currents, and, the, coincidental, deepening, of, isotherms, in, april, and, october, are, the, direct, consequence, of, the, propagation, of, downwelling, kelvin, waves, in, the, andaman, sea, remotely, forced, by, equatorial, wyrtki, jets, the, evolution, of, vorticity, in, the, basin, is, suggestive, of, strong, shear, in, the, flow, during, different, times, of, the, year, and, further, indicates, the, presence, of, low, frequency, geophysical, waves, such, as, westward, propagating, rossby, waves, and, other, transient, eddies, the, coastal, areas, of, the, andaman, sea, are, characterized, by, mangrove, forests, and, seagrass, meadows, mangroves, cover, between, more, than, 600, km, 2, 232, sq, mi, of, the, thai, shores, of, malay, peninsula, whereas, seagrass, meadows, occupy, an, area, of, 79, km, 2, 31, sq, mi, 25, 26, mangroves, are, largely, responsible, for, the, high, productivity, of, the, coastal, waters, their, roots, trap, soil, and, sediment, and, provide, shelter, from, predators, and, nursery, for, fish, and, small, aquatic, organisms, their, body, protects, the, shore, from, the, wind, and, waves, and, their, detritus, are, a, part, of, the, aquatic, food, chain, a, significant, part, of, the, thai, mangrove, forests, in, the, andaman, sea, was, removed, during, the, extensive, brackish, water, shrimp, farming, in, 1980s, mangroves, were, also, significantly, damaged, by, the, 2004, tsunami, they, were, partly, replanted, after, that, but, their, area, is, still, gradually, decreasing, due, to, human, activities, 6, 7, other, important, sources, of, nutrients, in, the, andaman, sea, are, seagrass, and, the, mud, bottoms, of, lagoons, and, coastal, areas, they, also, create, a, habitat, or, temporal, shelter, for, many, burrowing, and, benthic, organisms, many, aquatic, species, migrate, from, and, to, seagrass, either, daily, or, at, certain, stages, of, their, life, cycle, the, human, activities, which, damage, seagrass, beds, include, waste, water, discharge, from, coastal, industry, shrimp, farms, and, other, forms, of, coastal, development, as, well, as, trawling, and, the, use, of, push, nets, and, dragnets, the, 2004, tsunami, affected, 3, 5, of, seagrass, areas, along, the, andaman, sea, via, siltation, and, sand, sedimentation, and, 1, 5, suffered, total, habitat, loss, 7, the, sea, waters, along, the, malay, peninsula, favor, molluscan, growth, and, there, are, about, 280, edible, fish, species, belonging, to, 75, families, of, those, 232, species, 69, families, are, found, in, mangroves, and, 149, species, 51, families, reside, in, seagrass, so, 101, species, are, common, to, both, habitats, 26, the, sea, also, hosts, many, vulnerable, fauna, species, including, dugong, dugong, dugon, several, dolphin, species, such, as, irrawaddy, dolphin, orcaella, brevirostris, and, four, species, of, sea, turtles, critically, endangered, leatherback, turtle, dermochelys, coriacea, and, hawksbill, turtle, eletmochelys, imbricata, and, threatened, green, turtle, chelonia, mydas, and, olive, ridley, turtle, lepidochelys, olivacea, there, are, only, about, 150, dugongs, in, the, andaman, sea, scattered, between, ranong, and, satun, provinces, these, species, are, sensitive, to, the, degradation, of, seagrass, meadows, 8, coral, reefs, are, estimated, to, occupy, 73, 364, rai, 117, km, 2, in, the, andaman, sea, with, only, 6, 4, percent, in, ideal, condition, the, sea, has, long, been, used, for, fishing, and, transportation, of, goods, between, the, coastal, countries, thailand, alone, harvested, about, 943, 000, t, 2, 079, 10, 9, lb, of, fish, in, 2005, and, about, 710, 000, t, 1, 57, 10, 9, lb, in, 2000, of, those, 710, 000, t, 1, 57, 10, 9, lb, 490, 000, t, 1, 08, 10, 9, lb, are, accounted, for, by, trawling, 1, 017, vessels, 184, 000, t,

in, the, andaman, sea, 40, is, caught, in, waters, outside, thailand, s, eez, production, numbers, are, significantly, smaller, for, malaysia, and, are, comparable, or, higher, for, myanmar, competition, for, fish, resulted, in, numerous, conflicts, between, myanmar, and, thailand, in, 1998, and, 1999, they, resulted, in, fatalities, on, both, sides, and, nearly, escalated, into, a, military, conflict, in, both, cases, the, thai, navy, intervened, when, burmese, vessels, tried, to, intercept, thai, fishing, boats, in, the, contested, sea, areas, and, thai, fighter, aircraft, were, thought, to, be, deployed, by, the, national, security, council, thai, fishing, boats, were, also, frequently, confronted, by, the, malaysian, navy, to, the, extent, that, the, thai, government, had, to, caution, its, own, fishers, against, fishing, without, license, in, foreign, waters, the, 2004, marine, production, in, thailand, was, composed, of, pelagic, fish, 33, percent, demersal,
