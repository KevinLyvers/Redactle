the, british, isles, are, a, group, of, islands, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, off, the, north, western, coast, of, continental, europe, consisting, of, the, islands, of, great, britain, ireland, the, isle, of, man, the, inner, and, outer, hebrides, the, northern, isles, orkney, and, shetland, and, over, six, thousand, smaller, islands, they, have, a, total, area, of, 315, 159, km, 2, 121, 684, sq, mi, and, a, combined, population, of, almost, 72, million, and, include, two, sovereign, states, the, republic, of, ireland, which, covers, roughly, five, sixths, of, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, northern, ireland, the, channel, islands, off, the, north, coast, of, france, are, normally, taken, to, be, part, of, the, british, isles, even, though, geographically, they, do, not, form, part, of, the, archipelago, under, the, uk, interpretation, act, 1978, the, channel, islands, are, clarified, as, forming, part, of, the, british, islands, not, to, be, confused, with, the, british, isles, the, oldest, rocks, are, 2, 7, billion, years, old, and, are, found, in, ireland, wales, and, the, north, west, of, scotland, during, the, silurian, period, the, north, western, regions, collided, with, the, south, east, which, had, been, part, of, a, separate, continental, landmass, the, topography, of, the, islands, is, modest, in, scale, by, global, standards, ben, nevis, the, highest, mountain, rises, to, only, 1, 345, metres, 4, 413, ft, and, lough, neagh, which, is, notably, larger, than, other, lakes, in, the, island, group, covers, 390, square, kilometres, 151, sq, mi, the, climate, is, temperate, marine, with, cool, winters, and, warm, summers, the, north, atlantic, drift, brings, significant, moisture, and, raises, temperatures, 11, c, 20, f, above, the, global, average, for, the, latitude, this, led, to, a, landscape, that, was, long, dominated, by, temperate, rainforest, although, human, activity, has, since, cleared, the, vast, majority, of, forest, cover, the, region, was, re, inhabited, after, the, last, glacial, period, of, quaternary, glaciation, by, 12, 000, bc, when, great, britain, was, still, part, of, a, peninsula, of, the, european, continent, ireland, may, have, been, connected, to, great, britain, by, way, of, an, ice, bridge, before, 14, 000, bc, and, was, not, inhabited, until, after, 8000, bc, great, britain, became, an, island, by, 7000, bc, with, the, flooding, of, doggerland, the, gaels, ireland, picts, northern, great, britain, and, britons, southern, great, britain, all, speaking, insular, celtic, languages, inhabited, the, islands, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, much, of, brittonic, occupied, britain, was, conquered, by, the, roman, empire, from, ad, 43, the, first, anglo, saxons, arrived, as, roman, power, waned, in, the, 5th, century, and, eventually, they, dominated, the, bulk, of, what, is, now, england, viking, invasions, began, in, the, 9th, century, followed, by, more, permanent, settlements, and, political, change, particularly, in, england, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, and, the, later, angevin, partial, conquest, of, ireland, from, 1169, led, to, the, imposition, of, a, new, norman, ruling, elite, across, much, of, britain, and, parts, of, ireland, by, the, late, middle, ages, great, britain, was, separated, into, the, kingdom, of, england, and, kingdom, of, scotland, while, control, in, ireland, fluxed, between, gaelic, kingdoms, hiberno, norman, lords, and, the, english, dominated, lordship, of, ireland, soon, restricted, only, to, the, pale, the, 1603, union, of, the, crowns, acts, of, union, 1707, and, acts, of, union, 1800, aimed, to, consolidate, great, britain, and, ireland, into, a, single, political, unit, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, with, the, isle, of, man, and, the, channel, islands, remaining, as, crown, dependencies, the, expansion, of, the, british, empire, and, migrations, following, the, irish, famine, and, highland, clearances, resulted, in, the, dispersal, of, some, of, the, islands, population, and, culture, throughout, the, world, and, rapid, depopulation, of, ireland, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, most, of, ireland, seceded, from, the, united, kingdom, after, the, irish, war, of, independence, and, the, subsequent, anglo, irish, treaty, 1919, 1922, with, six, counties, remaining, in, the, uk, as, northern, ireland, as, a, term, british, isles, is, a, geographical, name, and, not, a, political, unit, in, ireland, the, term, is, controversial, and, there, are, objections, to, its, usage, the, government, of, ireland, does, not, officially, recognise, the, term, and, its, embassy, in, london, discourages, its, use, britain, and, ireland, is, used, as, an, alternative, description, and, atlantic, archipelago, has, also, seen, limited, use, in, academia, in, official, documents, created, jointly, by, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, such, as, the, good, friday, agreement, the, term, these, islands, is, used, the, earliest, known, references, to, the, islands, as, a, group, appeared, in, the, writings, of, seafarers, from, the, ancient, greek, colony, of, massalia, the, original, records, have, been, lost, however, later, writings, e, g, avienius, s, ora, maritima, that, quoted, from, the, massaliote, periplus, 6th, century, bc, and, from, pytheas, s, on, the, ocean, around, 325, 320, bc, have, survived, in, the, 1st, century, bc, diodorus, siculus, has, prettanik, n, sos, the, british, island, and, prettanoi, the, britons, strabo, used, brettanike, and, marcian, of, heraclea, in, his, periplus, maris, exteri, used, the, prettanic, isles, to, refer, to, the, islands, according, to, a, l, f, rivet, and, colin, smith, in, 1979, the, earliest, instance, of, the, name, which, is, textually, known, to, us, is, in, the, histories, of, polybius, who, referred, to, them, as, romanized, hai, bretannikai, n, soi, lit, the, brettanic, islands, or, the, british, isles, according, to, rivet, and, smith, this, name, encompassed, britain, with, ireland, historians, today, though, not, in, absolute, agreement, largely, agree, that, these, greek, and, latin, names, were, probably, drawn, from, native, celtic, language, names, for, the, archipelago, along, these, lines, the, inhabitants, of, the, islands, were, called, the, priteni, or, pretani, the, shift, from, the, p, of, pretannia, to, the, b, of, britannia, by, the, romans, occurred, during, the, time, of, julius, caesar, greco, egyptian, claudius, ptolemy, referred, to, the, larger, island, as, great, britain, megale, brettania, and, to, ireland, as, little, britain, mikra, brettania, in, his, work, almagest, 147, 148, ad, in, his, later, work, geography, c, 150, ad, he, gave, these, islands, the, names, alwion, iwernia, and, mona, the, isle, of, man, suggesting, these, may, have, been, names, of, the, individual, islands, not, known, to, him, at, the, time, of, writing, almagest, the, name, albion, appears, to, have, fallen, out, of, use, sometime, after, the, roman, conquest, of, great, britain, after, which, britain, became, the, more, commonplace, name, for, the, island, called, great, britain, in, the, english, language, however, the, cognate, alba, has, given, its, name, to, scotland, in, most, celtic, languages, alba, in, scottish, gaelic, albey, in, manx, albain, in, irish, and, alban, in, cornish, and, welsh, in, arabic, geography, and, cartography, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, the, british, isles, are, known, as, jaz, ir, bar, niya, or, jaz, ir, bar, niya, arabic, geographies, including, the, kit, b, az, z, j, of, al, batt, n, mention, the, british, isles, as, twelve, islands, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, phrase, brytish, iles, in, the, english, language, is, dated, 1577, in, a, work, by, john, dee, today, this, name, is, seen, by, some, as, carrying, imperialist, overtones, although, it, is, still, commonly, used, other, names, used, to, describe, the, islands, include, the, anglo, celtic, isles, atlantic, archipelago, a, term, coined, by, the, historian, j, g, a, pocock, in, 1975, british, irish, isles, britain, and, ireland, uk, and, ireland, and, british, isles, and, ireland, owing, to, political, and, national, associations, with, the, word, british, the, government, of, ireland, does, not, use, the, term, british, isles, and, in, documents, drawn, up, jointly, between, the, british, and, irish, governments, the, archipelago, is, referred, to, simply, as, these, islands, british, isles, is, still, the, most, widely, accepted, term, for, the, archipelago, the, british, isles, lie, at, the, juncture, of, several, regions, with, past, episodes, of, tectonic, mountain, building, these, orogenic, belts, form, a, complex, geology, that, records, a, huge, and, varied, span, of, earth, s, history, of, particular, note, was, the, caledonian, orogeny, during, the, ordovician, and, early, silurian, periods, when, the, craton, baltica, collided, with, the, terrane, avalonia, to, form, the, mountains, and, hills, in, northern, britain, and, ireland, baltica, formed, roughly, the, north, western, half, of, ireland, and, scotland, further, collisions, caused, the, variscan, orogeny, in, the, devonian, and, carboniferous, periods, forming, the, hills, of, munster, south, west, england, and, southern, wales, over, the, last, 500, million, years, the, land, that, forms, the, islands, has, drifted, north, west, from, around, 30, s, crossing, the, equator, around, 370, million, years, ago, to, reach, its, present, northern, latitude, the, islands, have, been, shaped, by, numerous, glaciations, during, the, quaternary, period, the, most, recent, being, the, devensian, as, this, ended, the, central, irish, sea, was, deglaciated, and, the, english, channel, flooded, with, sea, levels, rising, to, current, levels, some, 8, 000, years, ago, leaving, the, british, isles, in, their, current, form, there, are, about, 136, permanently, inhabited, islands, in, the, group, the, largest, two, being, great, britain, and, ireland, great, britain, is, to, the, east, and, covers, 83, 700, sq, mi, 217, 000, km, 2, ireland, is, to, the, west, and, covers, 32, 590, sq, mi, 84, 400, km, 2, the, largest, of, the, other, islands, are, to, be, found, in, the, hebrides, orkney, and, shetland, to, the, north, anglesey, and, the, isle, of, man, between, great, britain, and, ireland, and, the, channel, islands, near, the, coast, of, france, the, most, densely, populated, island, is, portsea, island, which, has, an, area, of, 9, 5, sq, mi, 25, km, 2, but, has, the, third, highest, population, behind, great, britain, and, ireland, the, islands, are, at, relatively, low, altitudes, with, central, ireland, and, southern, great, britain, particularly, low, lying, the, lowest, point, in, the, islands, is, the, north, slob, in, county, wexford, ireland, with, an, elevation, of, 3, 0, metres, 9, 8, ft, the, scottish, highlands, in, the, northern, part, of, great, britain, are, mountainous, with, ben, nevis, being, the, highest, point, on, the, islands, at, 1, 345, m, 4, 413, ft, other, mountainous, areas, include, wales, and, parts, of, ireland, although, only, seven, peaks, in, these, areas, reach, above, 1, 000, m, 3, 281, ft, lakes, on, the, islands, are, generally, not, large, although, lough, neagh, in, northern, ireland, is, an, exception, covering, 150, square, miles, 390, km, 2, the, largest, freshwater, body, in, great, britain, by, area, is, loch, lomond, at, 27, 5, square, miles, 71, km, 2, and, loch, ness, by, volume, whilst, loch, morar, is, the, deepest, freshwater, body, in, the, british, isles, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 310, m, 1, 017, ft, there, are, a, number, of, major, rivers, within, the, british, isles, the, longest, is, the, shannon, in, ireland, at, 224, mi, 360, km, the, river, severn, at, 220, mi, 354, km, is, the, longest, in, great, britain, the, climate, of, the, british, isles, is, mild, moist, and, changeable, with, abundant, rainfall, and, a, lack, of, temperature, extremes, it, is, defined, as, a, temperate, oceanic, climate, or, cfb, on, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, system, a, classification, it, shares, with, most, of, north, west, europe, the, north, atlantic, drift, gulf, stream, which, flows, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, brings, with, it, significant, moisture, and, raises, temperatures, 11, c, 20, f, above, the, global, average, for, the, islands, latitudes, most, atlantic, depressions, pass, to, the, north, of, the, islands, combined, with, the, general, westerly, circulation, and, interactions, with, the, landmass, this, imposes, a, general, east, west, variation, in, climate, there, are, four, distinct, climate, patterns, south, east, with, cold, winters, warm, and, dry, summers, south, west, having, mild, and, very, wet, winters, warm, and, wet, summers, north, west, generally, wet, with, mild, winters, and, cool, summers, and, north, east, with, cold, winters, cool, summers, the, islands, enjoy, a, mild, climate, and, varied, soils, giving, rise, to, a, diverse, pattern, of, vegetation, animal, and, plant, life, is, similar, to, that, of, the, north, western, european, mainland, there, are, however, fewer, numbers, of, species, with, ireland, having, even, less, all, native, flora, and, fauna, in, ireland, is, made, up, of, species, that, migrated, primarily, from, great, britain, the, only, window, when, this, could, have, occurred, was, prior, to, the, melting, of, the, ice, bridge, between, the, two, islands, 14, 000, years, ago, approaching, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, as, with, most, of, europe, prehistoric, britain, and, ireland, were, covered, with, forest, and, swamp, clearing, began, around, 6000, bc, and, accelerated, in, medieval, times, despite, this, britain, retained, its, primeval, forests, longer, than, most, of, europe, due, to, a, small, population, and, later, development, of, trade, and, industry, and, wood, shortages, were, not, a, problem, until, the, 17th, century, by, the, 18th, century, most, of, britain, s, forests, were, consumed, for, shipbuilding, or, manufacturing, charcoal, and, the, nation, was, forced, to, import, lumber, from, scandinavia, north, america, and, the, baltic, most, forest, land, in, ireland, is, maintained, by, state, forestation, programmes, almost, all, land, outside, urban, areas, is, farmland, however, relatively, large, areas, of, forest, remain, in, east, and, north, scotland, and, in, southeast, england, oak, elm, ash, and, beech, are, amongst, the, most, common, trees, in, england, in, scotland, pine, and, birch, are, most, common, natural, forests, in, ireland, are, mainly, oak, ash, wych, elm, birch, and, pine, beech, and, lime, though, not, native, to, ireland, are, also, common, there, farmland, hosts, a, variety, of, semi, natural, vegetation, of, grasses, and, flowering, plants, woods, hedgerows, mountain, slopes, and, marshes, host, heather, wild, grasses, gorse, and, bracken, many, larger, animals, such, as, wolves, bears, and, european, elk, are, today, extinct, however, some, species, such, as, red, deer, are, protected, other, small, mammals, such, as, rabbits, foxes, badgers, hares, hedgehogs, and, stoats, are, very, common, and, the, european, beaver, has, been, reintroduced, in, parts, of, scotland, wild, boar, have, also, been, reintroduced, to, parts, of, southern, england, following, escapes, from, boar, farms, and, illegal, releases, many, rivers, contain, otters, and, grey, and, common, seals, are, numerous, on, coasts, there, are, about, 250, bird, species, regularly, recorded, in, great, britain, and, another, 350, that, occur, with, varying, degrees, of, rarity, the, most, numerous, species, are, wren, robin, house, sparrow, woodpigeon, chaffinch, and, blackbird, farmland, birds, are, declining, in, number, except, for, those, kept, for, game, such, as, pheasant, red, legged, partridge, and, red, grouse, fish, are, abundant, in, the, rivers, and, lakes, in, particular, salmon, trout, perch, and, pike, sea, fish, include, dogfish, cod, sole, pollock, and, bass, as, well, as, mussels, crab, and, oysters, along, the, coast, there, are, more, than, 21, 000, species, of, insects, few, species, of, reptiles, or, amphibians, are, found, in, great, britain, or, ireland, only, three, snakes, are, native, to, great, britain, the, adder, the, barred, grass, snake, and, the, smooth, snake, none, are, native, to, ireland, in, general, great, britain, has, slightly, more, variation, and, native, wildlife, with, weasels, polecats, wildcats, most, shrews, moles, water, voles, roe, deer, and, common, toads, also, being, absent, from, ireland, this, pattern, is, also, true, for, birds, and, insects, notable, exceptions, include, the, kerry, slug, and, certain, species, of, woodlouse, native, to, ireland, but, not, great, britain, domestic, animals, include, the, connemara, pony, shetland, pony, english, mastiff, irish, wolfhound, and, many, varieties, of, cattle, and, sheep, england, has, a, generally, high, population, density, with, almost, 80, of, the, total, population, of, the, islands, elsewhere, in, great, britain, and, ireland, high, density, of, population, is, limited, to, areas, around, a, few, large, cities, the, largest, urban, area, by, far, is, the, greater, london, built, up, area, with, 9, million, inhabitants, other, major, population, centres, include, the, greater, manchester, built, up, area, 2, 4, million, west, midlands, conurbation, 2, 4, million, and, west, yorkshire, urban, area, 1, 6, million, in, england, greater, glasgow, 1, 2, million, in, scotland, and, greater, dublin, area, 1, 9, million, in, ireland, the, population, of, england, rose, rapidly, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, whereas, the, populations, of, scotland, and, wales, showed, little, increase, during, the, 20th, century, the, population, of, scotland, has, remained, unchanged, since, 1951, ireland, for, most, of, its, history, had, much, the, same, population, density, as, great, britain, about, one, third, of, the, total, population, however, since, the, great, irish, famine, the, population, of, ireland, has, fallen, to, less, than, one, tenth, of, the, population, of, the, british, isles, the, famine, caused, a, century, long, population, decline, drastically, reduced, the, irish, population, and, permanently, altered, the, demographic, make, up, of, the, british, isles, on, a, global, scale, this, disaster, led, to, the, creation, of, an, irish, diaspora, that, numbers, fifteen, times, the, current, population, of, the, island, the, linguistic, heritage, of, the, british, isles, is, rich, with, twelve, languages, from, six, groups, across, four, branches, of, the, indo, european, family, the, insular, celtic, languages, of, the, goidelic, sub, group, irish, manx, and, scottish, gaelic, and, the, brittonic, sub, group, cornish, welsh, and, breton, spoken, in, north, western, france, are, the, only, remaining, celtic, languages, the, last, of, their, continental, relations, were, extinct, before, the, 7th, century, the, norman, languages, of, guern, siais, j, rriais, and, sercquiais, spoken, in, the, channel, islands, are, similar, to, french, a, language, also, spoken, there, a, cant, called, shelta, is, spoken, by, irish, travellers, often, to, conceal, meaning, from, those, outside, the, group, however, english, including, scots, is, the, dominant, language, with, few, monoglots, remaining, in, the, other, languages, of, the, region, the, norn, language, of, orkney, and, shetland, became, extinct, around, 1880, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, british, isles, were, repeatedly, submerged, beneath, an, ice, sheet, which, extended, into, the, middle, of, the, north, sea, with, a, larger, ice, sheet, that, covered, a, significant, proportion, of, scandinavia, on, the, opposite, side, around, 1, 9, million, years, ago, these, two, ice, sheets, frequently, merged, essentially, creating, a, land, bridge, between, scandinavia, and, northern, great, britain, further, south, there, was, a, direct, land, bridge, now, known, as, doggerland, which, was, gradually, submerged, as, sea, levels, rose, however, the, irish, sea, was, formed, before, doggerland, was, completely, covered, in, water, with, ireland, becoming, an, island, roughly, 6, 000, years, before, great, britain, did, the, first, evidence, of, human, activity, on, the, islands, dates, from, 840, 000, or, 950, 000, years, ago, based, in, flint, tools, found, near, happisburgh, on, the, norfolk, coast, of, great, britain, in, contrast, the, earliest, evidence, of, human, activity, on, the, island, of, ireland, dates, from, 12, 500, years, ago, at, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, about, two, thousand, years, ago, various, tribes, which, spoke, celtic, dialects, of, the, insular, celtic, group, were, inhabiting, the, islands, the, romans, expanded, their, civilisation, to, control, southern, great, britain, but, were, impeded, in, advancing, any, further, building, hadrian, s, wall, to, mark, the, northern, frontier, of, their, empire, in, 122, ad, at, that, time, ireland, was, populated, by, a, people, known, as, hiberni, the, northern, third, or, so, of, great, britain, by, a, people, known, as, picts, and, the, southern, two, thirds, by, britons, anglo, saxons, arrived, as, roman, power, waned, in, the, 5th, century, ad, initially, their, arrival, seems, to, have, been, at, the, invitation, of, the, britons, as, mercenaries, to, repulse, incursions, by, the, hiberni, and, picts, in, time, anglo, saxon, demands, on, the, british, became, so, great, that, they, came, to, culturally, dominate, the, bulk, of, southern, great, britain, though, recent, genetic, evidence, suggests, britons, still, formed, the, bulk, of, the, population, this, dominance, created, what, is, now, england, and, left, culturally, british, enclaves, only, in, the, north, of, what, is, now, england, in, cornwall, and, what, is, now, known, as, wales, ireland, had, been, unaffected, by, the, romans, except, significantly, for, being, christianised, traditionally, by, the, romano, briton, saint, patrick, as, europe, including, britain, descended, into, turmoil, following, the, collapse, of, roman, civilisation, an, era, known, as, the, dark, ages, ireland, entered, a, golden, age, and, responded, with, missions, first, to, great, britain, and, then, to, the, continent, the, founding, of, monasteries, and, universities, these, were, later, joined, by, anglo, saxon, missions, of, a, similar, nature, viking, invasions, began, in, the, 9th, century, followed, by, more, permanent, settlements, particularly, along, the, east, coast, of, ireland, the, west, coast, of, modern, day, scotland, and, the, isle, of, man, though, the, vikings, were, eventually, neutralised, in, ireland, their, influence, remained, in, the, cities, of, dublin, cork, limerick, waterford, and, wexford, england, however, was, slowly, conquered, around, the, turn, of, the, first, millennium, ad, and, eventually, became, a, feudal, possession, of, denmark, the, relations, between, the, descendants, of, vikings, in, england, and, counterparts, in, normandy, in, northern, france, lay, at, the, heart, of, a, series, of, events, that, led, to, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, the, remnants, of, the, duchy, of, normandy, which, conquered, england, remain, associated, to, the, english, crown, as, the, channel, islands, to, this, day, a, century, later, the, marriage, of, the, future, henry, ii, of, england, to, eleanor, of,

the, only, englishman, to, be, elected, pope, the, angevins, invaded, ireland, in, 1169, though, initially, intended, to, be, kept, as, an, independent, kingdom, the, failure, of, the, irish, high, king, to, ensure, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, windsor, led, henry, ii, as, king, of, england, to, rule, as, effective, monarch, under, the, title, of, lord, of, ireland, this, title, was,

of, the, pope, from, the, affairs, of, the, english, church, ireland, which, had, been, held, by, the, king, of, england, as, lord, of, ireland, but, which, strictly, speaking, had, been, a, feudal,
