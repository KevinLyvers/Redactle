mauna, loa, m, n, l, o, m, a, n, hawaiian, lit, long, mountain, is, one, of, five, volcanoes, that, form, the, island, of, hawaii, in, the, u, s, state, of, hawaii, in, the, pacific, ocean, mauna, loa, is, earth, s, largest, active, volcano, by, both, mass, and, volume, it, was, historically, considered, to, be, the, largest, volcano, on, earth, until, tamu, massif, was, discovered, to, be, larger, mauna, loa, is, a, shield, volcano, with, relatively, gentle, slopes, and, a, volume, estimated, at, 18, 000, cubic, miles, 75, 000, km, 3, although, its, peak, is, about, 125, feet, 38, m, lower, than, that, of, its, neighbor, mauna, kea, lava, eruptions, from, mauna, loa, are, silica, poor, and, very, fluid, and, tend, to, be, non, explosive, mauna, loa, has, likely, been, erupting, for, at, least, 700, 000, years, and, may, have, emerged, above, sea, level, about, 400, 000, years, ago, some, dated, rocks, are, 470, 000, years, old, the, volcano, s, magma, comes, from, the, hawaii, hotspot, which, has, been, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, hawaiian, island, chain, over, tens, of, millions, of, years, the, slow, drift, of, the, pacific, plate, will, eventually, carry, mauna, loa, away, from, the, hotspot, within, 500, 000, to, one, million, years, from, now, at, which, point, it, will, become, extinct, mauna, loa, s, most, recent, eruption, began, on, november, 27, 2022, and, ended, on, december, 13, 2022, it, was, the, first, eruption, since, 1984, no, recent, eruptions, of, the, volcano, have, caused, fatalities, but, eruptions, in, 1926, and, 1950, destroyed, villages, and, the, city, of, hilo, is, partly, built, on, lava, flows, from, the, late, 19th, century, because, of, the, potential, hazards, it, poses, to, population, centers, mauna, loa, is, part, of, the, decade, volcanoes, program, which, encourages, studies, of, the, world, s, most, dangerous, volcanoes, mauna, loa, has, been, monitored, intensively, by, the, hawaiian, volcano, observatory, since, 1912, observations, of, the, atmosphere, are, undertaken, at, the, mauna, loa, observatory, and, of, the, sun, at, the, mauna, loa, solar, observatory, both, located, near, the, mountain, s, summit, hawaii, volcanoes, national, park, covers, the, summit, and, portions, of, the, southeastern, and, southwestern, flanks, of, the, volcano, and, also, incorporates, k, lauea, a, separate, volcano, like, all, hawaiian, volcanoes, mauna, loa, was, created, as, the, pacific, tectonic, plate, moved, over, the, hawaii, hotspot, in, the, earth, s, underlying, mantle, the, hawaii, island, volcanoes, are, the, most, recent, evidence, of, this, process, that, over, 70, million, years, has, created, the, 3, 700, mi, 6, 000, km, long, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, the, prevailing, view, states, that, the, hotspot, has, been, largely, stationary, within, the, planet, s, mantle, for, much, if, not, all, of, the, cenozoic, era, however, while, the, hawaiian, mantle, plume, is, well, understood, and, extensively, studied, the, nature, of, hotspots, themselves, remains, fairly, enigmatic, mauna, loa, is, one, of, five, subaerial, volcanoes, that, make, up, the, island, of, hawai, i, the, oldest, volcano, on, the, island, kohala, is, more, than, a, million, years, old, and, k, lauea, the, youngest, is, believed, to, be, between, 210, 000, and, 280, 000, years, of, age, kama, ehuakanaloa, formerly, l, ihi, on, the, island, s, flank, is, even, younger, but, has, yet, to, breach, the, surface, of, the, pacific, ocean, at, 1, million, to, 600, 000, years, of, age, mauna, loa, is, the, second, youngest, of, the, five, volcanoes, on, the, island, making, it, the, third, youngest, volcano, in, the, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, a, chain, of, shield, volcanoes, and, seamounts, extending, from, hawaii, to, the, kuril, kamchatka, trench, in, russia, following, the, pattern, of, hawaiian, volcano, formation, mauna, loa, would, have, started, as, a, submarine, volcano, gradually, building, itself, up, through, underwater, eruptions, of, alkali, basalt, before, emerging, from, the, sea, through, a, series, of, surtseyan, eruptions, about, 400, 000, years, ago, since, then, the, volcano, has, remained, active, with, a, history, of, effusive, and, explosive, eruptions, including, 34, eruptions, since, the, first, well, documented, eruption, in, 1843, mauna, loa, is, the, largest, active, volcano, on, earth, and, the, planet, s, third, largest, volcano, behind, p, h, honu, which, is, also, in, the, hawaiian, chain, and, the, tamu, massif, it, covers, a, land, area, of, 5, 271, km, 2, 2, 035, sq, mi, and, spans, a, maximum, width, of, 120, km, 75, mi, consisting, of, approximately, 65, 000, to, 80, 000, km, 3, 15, 600, to, 19, 200, cu, mi, of, solid, rock, it, makes, up, more, than, half, of, the, surface, area, of, the, island, of, hawai, i, combining, the, volcano, s, extensive, submarine, flanks, 5, 000, m, 16, 400, ft, to, the, sea, floor, and, 4, 170, m, 13, 680, ft, subaerial, height, mauna, loa, rises, 9, 170, m, 30, 085, ft, from, base, to, summit, greater, than, the, 8, 848, m, or, 29, 029, ft, elevation, of, mount, everest, from, sea, level, to, its, summit, in, addition, much, of, the, mountain, is, invisible, even, underwater, its, mass, depresses, the, crust, beneath, it, by, another, 8, km, 5, mi, in, the, shape, of, an, inverse, mountain, meaning, the, total, height, of, mauna, loa, from, the, start, of, its, eruptive, history, is, about, 17, 170, m, 56, 000, ft, mauna, loa, is, a, typical, shield, volcano, in, form, taking, the, shape, of, a, long, broad, dome, extending, down, to, the, ocean, floor, whose, slopes, are, about, 12, at, their, steepest, a, consequence, of, its, extremely, fluid, lava, the, shield, stage, lavas, that, built, the, enormous, main, mass, of, the, mountain, are, tholeiitic, basalts, like, those, of, mauna, kea, created, through, the, mixing, of, primary, magma, and, subducted, oceanic, crust, mauna, loa, s, summit, hosts, three, overlapping, pit, craters, arranged, northeast, southwest, the, first, and, last, roughly, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, in, diameter, and, the, second, an, oblong, 4, 2, km, 2, 5, km, 2, 6, mi, 1, 6, mi, feature, together, these, three, craters, make, up, the, 6, 2, by, 2, 5, km, 3, 9, by, 1, 6, mi, summit, caldera, moku, weoweo, so, named, for, the, hawaiian, weoweo, fish, priacanthus, meeki, purportedly, due, to, the, resemblance, of, its, eruptive, fires, to, the, coloration, of, the, fish, moku, weoweo, s, caldera, floor, lies, between, 170, and, 50, m, 558, and, 164, ft, beneath, its, rim, and, it, is, only, the, latest, of, several, calderas, that, have, formed, and, reformed, over, the, volcano, s, life, it, was, created, between, 1, 000, and, 1, 500, years, ago, by, a, large, eruption, from, mauna, loa, s, northeast, rift, zone, which, emptied, out, a, shallow, magma, chamber, beneath, the, summit, and, collapsed, it, into, its, present, form, additionally, two, smaller, pit, craters, lie, southwest, of, the, caldera, named, lua, hou, new, pit, and, lua, hohonu, deep, pit, mauna, loa, s, summit, is, also, the, focal, point, for, its, two, prominent, rift, zones, marked, on, the, surface, by, well, preserved, relatively, recent, lava, flows, easily, seen, in, satellite, imagery, and, linearly, arranged, fracture, lines, intersected, by, cinder, and, splatter, cones, these, rift, zones, are, deeply, set, structures, driven, by, dike, intrusions, along, a, decollement, fault, that, is, believed, to, reach, down, all, the, way, to, the, volcano, s, base, 12, to, 14, km, 7, to, 9, mi, deep, the, first, is, a, 60, km, 37, mi, rift, trending, southwest, from, the, caldera, to, the, sea, and, a, further, 40, km, 25, mi, underwater, with, a, prominent, 40, directional, change, along, its, length, this, rift, zone, is, historically, active, across, most, of, its, length, the, second, northeastern, rift, zone, extends, towards, hilo, and, is, historically, active, across, only, the, first, 20, km, 12, mi, of, its, length, with, a, nearly, straight, and, in, its, latter, sections, poorly, defined, trend, the, northeastern, rift, zone, takes, the, form, of, a, succession, of, cinder, cones, the, most, prominent, of, which, the, 60, m, 197, ft, high, puu, ulaula, or, red, hill, there, is, also, a, less, definite, northward, rift, zone, that, extends, towards, the, humuula, saddle, marking, the, intersection, of, mauna, loa, and, mauna, kea, simplified, geophysical, models, of, mauna, loa, s, magma, chamber, have, been, constructed, using, interferometric, synthetic, aperture, radar, measures, of, ground, deformation, due, to, the, slow, buildup, of, lava, under, the, volcano, s, surface, these, models, predict, a, 1, 1, km, 1, mi, wide, magma, chamber, located, at, a, depth, of, about, 4, 7, km, 3, mi, 0, 5, km, 0, mi, below, sea, level, near, the, southeastern, margin, of, moku, weoweo, this, shallow, magma, chamber, is, significantly, higher, placed, than, mauna, loa, s, rift, zones, suggesting, magma, intrusions, into, the, deeper, parts, and, occasional, dike, injections, into, the, shallower, parts, of, the, rift, zone, drive, rift, activity, a, similar, mechanism, has, been, proposed, for, neighboring, k, lauea, earlier, models, based, on, mauna, loa, s, 1975, and, 1984, eruptions, made, a, similar, prediction, placing, the, chamber, at, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, deep, in, roughly, the, same, geographic, position, mauna, loa, has, complex, interactions, with, its, neighbors, hual, lai, to, the, northwest, mauna, kea, to, the, northeast, and, particularly, k, lauea, to, the, east, lavas, from, mauna, kea, intersect, with, mauna, loa, s, basal, flows, as, a, consequence, of, kea, s, older, age, and, mauna, kea, s, original, rift, zones, were, buried, beneath, post, shield, volcanic, rocks, of, mauna, loa, additionally, mauna, kea, shares, mauna, loa, s, gravity, well, depressing, the, ocean, crust, beneath, it, by, 6, km, 4, mi, there, are, also, a, series, of, normal, faults, on, mauna, loa, s, northern, and, western, slopes, between, its, two, major, rift, zones, that, are, believed, to, be, the, result, of, combined, circumferential, tension, from, the, two, rift, zones, and, from, added, pressure, due, to, the, westward, growth, of, neighboring, k, lauea, because, k, lauea, lacks, topographical, prominence, and, appears, as, a, bulge, on, the, southeastern, flank, of, mauna, loa, it, was, historically, interpreted, by, both, native, hawaiians, and, early, geologists, to, be, an, active, satellite, of, mauna, loa, however, analysis, of, the, chemical, composition, of, lavas, from, the, two, volcanoes, show, that, they, have, separate, magma, chambers, and, are, thus, distinct, nonetheless, their, proximity, has, led, to, a, historical, trend, in, which, high, activity, at, one, volcano, roughly, coincides, with, low, activity, at, the, other, when, k, lauea, lay, dormant, between, 1934, and, 1952, mauna, loa, became, active, and, when, the, latter, remained, quiet, from, 1952, to, 1974, the, reverse, was, true, this, is, not, always, the, case, the, 1984, eruption, of, mauna, loa, started, during, an, eruption, at, k, lauea, but, had, no, discernible, effect, on, the, k, lauea, eruption, and, the, 2022, eruption, of, mauna, loa, occurred, during, an, eruption, of, k, lauea, geologists, have, suggested, that, pulses, of, magma, entering, mauna, loa, s, deeper, magma, system, may, have, increased, pressure, inside, k, lauea, and, triggered, the, concurrent, eruptions, mauna, loa, is, slumping, eastward, along, its, southwestern, rift, zone, leveraging, its, mass, into, k, lauea, and, driving, the, latter, eastward, at, a, rate, of, about, 10, cm, 4, in, per, year, the, interaction, between, the, two, volcanoes, in, this, manner, has, generated, a, number, of, large, earthquakes, in, the, past, and, has, resulted, in, a, significant, area, of, debris, off, k, lauea, s, seaward, flank, known, as, the, hilina, slump, a, system, of, older, faults, exists, on, the, southeastern, side, of, mauna, loa, that, likely, formed, before, kilauea, became, large, enough, to, impede, mauna, loa, s, slump, the, lowest, and, northernmost, of, which, the, kaoiki, fault, remains, an, active, earthquake, center, today, the, west, side, of, mauna, loa, meanwhile, is, unimpeded, in, movement, and, indeed, is, believed, to, have, undergone, a, massive, slump, collapse, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, years, ago, the, residue, from, which, consisting, of, a, scattering, of, debris, up, to, several, kilometers, wide, and, up, to, 50, km, 31, mi, distant, is, still, visible, today, the, damage, was, so, extensive, that, the, headwall, of, the, damage, likely, intersected, its, southwestern, rift, zone, there, is, very, little, movement, there, today, a, consequence, of, the, volcano, s, geometry, mauna, loa, is, tall, enough, to, have, experienced, glaciation, during, the, last, ice, age, 25, 000, to, 15, 000, years, ago, unlike, mauna, kea, on, which, extensive, evidence, of, glaciation, remains, even, today, mauna, loa, was, at, the, time, and, has, remained, active, having, grown, an, additional, 150, to, 300, m, 492, to, 984, ft, in, height, since, then, and, covering, any, glacial, deposits, beneath, new, flows, strata, of, that, age, don, t, occur, until, at, least, 2, 000, m, 6, 562, ft, down, from, the, volcano, s, summit, too, low, for, glacial, growth, mauna, loa, also, lacks, its, neighbor, s, summit, permafrost, region, although, sporadic, ice, persists, in, places, it, is, speculated, that, extensive, phreatomagmatic, activity, occurred, during, this, time, contributing, extensively, to, ash, deposits, on, the, summit, to, have, reached, its, enormous, size, within, its, relatively, short, geologically, speaking, 600, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, years, of, life, mauna, loa, would, logically, have, had, to, have, grown, extremely, rapidly, through, its, developmental, history, and, extensive, charcoal, based, radiocarbon, dating, perhaps, the, most, extensive, such, prehistorical, eruptive, dating, on, earth, has, amassed, a, record, of, almost, two, hundred, reliably, dated, extant, flows, confirming, this, hypothesis, lava, samples, including, those, obtained, by, drilling, projects, have, been, dated, at, least, to, 470, 000, years, ago, for, technical, reasons, the, oldest, ages, obtained, by, modern, techniques, at, 657, 000, years, ago, have, large, errors, of, the, order, of, 200, 000, years, as, did, some, historic, dating, attempts, on, younger, lavas, making, them, older, than, was, the, case, conclusions, some, of, the, oldest, exposed, flows, on, mauna, loa, are, the, ninole, hills, on, its, southern, flank, subaerial, basalt, rock, dating, back, approximately, 100, to, 200, thousand, years, they, form, a, terrace, against, which, younger, flows, have, since, banked, heavily, eroded, and, incised, against, its, slope, in, terms, of, direction, this, is, believed, to, be, the, result, of, a, period, of, erosion, because, of, a, change, in, the, direction, of, lava, flow, caused, by, the, volcano, s, prehistoric, slump, these, are, followed, by, two, units, of, lava, flows, separated, by, an, intervening, ash, layer, known, as, the, p, hala, ash, layer, the, older, kahuka, basalt, sparsely, exposed, on, the, lower, southwest, rift, and, the, younger, and, far, more, widespread, ka, u, basalt, which, appear, more, widely, on, the, volcano, the, p, hala, ashes, themselves, were, produced, over, a, long, period, of, time, circa, 13, to, 30, thousand, years, ago, although, heavy, vitrification, and, interactions, with, post, and, pre, creation, flows, has, hindered, exact, dating, their, age, roughly, corresponds, to, the, glaciation, of, mauna, loa, during, the, last, ice, age, raising, the, distinct, possibility, that, it, is, the, product, of, phreatomagmatic, interaction, between, the, long, gone, glaciers, and, mauna, loa, s, eruptive, activities, studies, have, shown, that, a, cycle, occurs, in, which, volcanic, activity, at, the, summit, is, dominant, for, several, hundred, years, after, which, activity, shifts, to, the, rift, zones, for, several, more, centuries, and, then, back, to, the, summit, again, two, cycles, have, been, clearly, identified, each, lasting, 1, 500, 2, 000, years, this, cyclical, behavior, is, unique, to, mauna, loa, among, the, hawaiian, volcanoes, between, about, 7, 000, and, 6, 000, years, ago, mauna, loa, was, largely, inactive, the, cause, of, this, cessation, in, activity, is, not, known, and, no, known, similar, hiatus, has, been, found, at, other, hawaiian, volcanoes, except, for, those, currently, in, the, post, shield, stage, between, 11, 000, and, 8, 000, years, ago, activity, was, more, intense, than, it, is, today, however, mauna, loa, s, overall, rate, of, growth, has, probably, begun, to, slow, over, the, last, 100, 000, years, and, the, volcano, may, in, fact, be, nearing, the, end, of, its, tholeiitic, basalt, shield, building, phase, ancient, hawaiians, have, been, present, on, hawai, i, island, for, about, 1, 500, years, but, they, preserved, almost, no, records, on, volcanic, activity, on, the, island, beyond, a, few, fragmentary, accounts, dating, to, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, possible, eruptions, occurred, around, 1730, and, 1750, and, sometime, during, 1780, and, 1803, a, june, 1832, eruption, was, witnessed, by, a, missionary, on, maui, but, the, 190, km, 118, mi, between, the, two, islands, and, lack, of, apparent, geological, evidence, have, cast, this, testimony, in, doubt, thus, the, first, entirely, confirmed, historically, witnessed, eruption, was, a, january, 1843, event, since, that, time, mauna, loa, has, erupted, 32, times, historical, eruptions, at, mauna, loa, are, typically, hawaiian, in, character, and, rarely, violent, starting, with, the, emergence, of, lava, fountains, over, a, several, kilometer, long, rift, colloquially, known, as, the, curtain, of, fire, often, but, not, always, propagating, from, mauna, loa, s, summit, and, eventually, concentrating, at, a, single, vent, its, long, term, eruptive, center, activity, centered, on, its, summit, is, usually, followed, by, flank, eruptions, up, to, a, few, months, later, and, although, mauna, loa, is, historically, less, active, than, that, of, its, neighbor, kilauea, it, tends, to, produce, greater, volumes, of, lava, over, shorter, periods, of, time, most, eruptions, are, centered, at, either, the, summit, or, either, of, its, two, major, rift, zones, within, the, last, two, hundred, years, 38, percent, of, eruptions, occurred, at, the, summit, 31, percent, at, the, northeast, rift, zone, 25, percent, at, the, southwest, rift, zone, and, the, remaining, 6, percent, from, northwest, vents, 40, percent, of, the, volcano, s, surface, consists, of, lavas, less, than, a, thousand, years, old, and, 98, percent, of, lavas, less, than, 10, 000, years, old, in, addition, to, the, summit, and, rift, zones, mauna, loa, s, northwestern, flank, has, also, been, the, source, of, three, historical, eruptions, the, 1843, event, was, followed, by, eruptions, in, 1849, 1851, 1852, and, 1855, with, the, 1855, flows, being, particularly, extensive, 1859, marked, the, largest, of, the, three, historical, flows, that, have, been, centered, on, mauna, loa, s, northwestern, flank, producing, a, long, lava, flow, that, reached, the, ocean, on, hawaii, island, s, west, coast, north, of, k, holo, bay, an, eruption, in, 1868, occurred, alongside, the, enormous, 1868, hawaii, earthquake, a, magnitude, eight, event, that, claimed, 77, lives, and, remains, the, largest, earthquake, ever, to, hit, the, island, following, further, activity, in, 1871, mauna, loa, experienced, nearly, continuous, activity, from, august, 1872, through, 1877, a, long, lasting, and, voluminous, eruption, lasting, approximately, 1, 200, days, and, never, moving, beyond, its, summit, a, short, single, day, eruption, in, 1877, was, unusual, in, that, it, took, place, underwater, in, kealakekua, bay, and, within, a, mile, of, the, shoreline, curious, onlookers, approaching, the, area, in, boats, reported, unusually, turbulent, water, and, occasional, floating, blocks, of, hardened, lava, further, eruptions, occurred, in, 1879, and, then, twice, in, 1880, the, latter, of, which, extended, into, 1881, and, came, within, the, present, boundaries, of, the, island, s, largest, city, hilo, however, at, the, time, the, settlement, was, a, shore, side, village, located, further, down, the, volcano, s, slope, and, so, was, unaffected, mauna, loa, continued, its, activity, and, of, the, eruptions, that, occurred, in, 1887, 1892, 1896, 1899, 1903, twice, 1907, 1914, 1916, 1919, and, 1926, three, in, 1887, 1919, and, 1926, were, partially, subaerial, the, 1926, eruption, in, particular, is, noteworthy, for, having, inundated, a, village, near, ho, p, loa, destroying, 12, houses, a, church, and, a, small, harbor, after, an, event, in, 1933, mauna, loa, s, 1935, eruption, caused, a, public, crisis, when, its, flows, started, to, head, towards, hilo, a, bombing, operation, was, decided, upon, to, try, and, divert, the, flows, planned, out, by, then, lieutenant, colonel, george, s, patton, the, bombing, conducted, on, december, 27, was, declared, a, success, by, thomas, a, jaggar, director, of, the, hawaiian, volcano, observatory, and, lava, stopped, flowing, by, january, 2, 1936, however, the, role, the, bombing, played, in, ending, the, eruption, has, since, been, heavily, disputed, by, volcanologists, a, longer, but, summit, bound, event, in, 1940, was, comparatively, less, interesting, mauna, loa, s, 1942, eruption, occurred, only, four, months, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, the, united, states, entry, into, world, war, ii, and, created, a, unique, problem, for, the, wartime, united, states, occurring, during, an, enforced, nighttime, blackout, on, the, island, the, eruption, s, luminosity, forced, the, government, to, issue, a, gag, order, on, the, local, press, hoping, to, prevent, news, of, its, occurrence, spreading, for, fear, that, the, japanese, would, use, it, to, launch, a, bombing, run, on, the, island, however, as, flows, from, the, eruption, rapidly, spread, down, the, volcano, s, flank, and, threatened, the, ola, a, flume, mountain, view, s, primary, water, source, the, united, states, army, air, force, decided, to, drop, its, own, bombs, on, the, island, in, the, hopes, of, redirecting, the, flows, away, from, the, flume, sixteen, bombs, weighing, between, 300, and, 600, lb, 136, and, 272, kg, each, were, dropped, on, the, island, but, produced, little, effect, eventually, the, eruption, ceased, on, its, own, following, a, 1949, event, the, next, major, eruption, at, mauna, loa, occurred, in, 1950, originating, from, the, volcano, s, southwestern, rift, zone, the, eruption, remains, the, largest, rift, event, in, the, volcano, s, modern, history, lasting, 23, days, emitting, 376, million, cubic, meters, of, lava, and, reaching, the, 24, km, 15, mi, distant, ocean, within, 3, hours, the, 1950, eruption, was, not, the, most, voluminous, eruption, on, the, volcano, the, long, lived, 1872, 1877, event, produced, more, than, twice, as, much, material, but, it, was, easily, one, of, the, fastest, acting, producing, the, same, amount, of, lava, as, the, 1859, eruption, in, a, tenth, of, the, time, flows, overtook, the, village, of, ho, okena, mauka, in, south, kona, crossed, hawaii, route, 11, and, reached, the, sea, within, four, hours, of, eruption, although, there, was, no, loss, of, life, the, village, was, permanently, destroyed, after, the, 1950, event, mauna, loa, entered, an, extended, period, of, dormancy, interrupted, only, by, a, small, single, day, summit, event, in, 1975, however, it, rumbled, to, life, again, in, 1984, manifesting, first, at, mauna, loa, s, summit, and, then, producing, a, narrow, channelized, a, flow, that, advanced, downslope, within, 6, km, 4, mi, of, hilo, close, enough, to, illuminate, the, city, at, nighttime, however, the, flow, got, no, closer, as, two, natural, levees, further, up, its, pathway, consequently, broke, and, diverted, active, flows, from, 1985, to, 2022, the, volcano, had, its, longest, period, of, quiet, in, recorded, history, magma, had, been, accumulating, beneath, mauna, loa, since, the, 1984, eruption, and, the, u, s, geological, survey, in, february, 2021, reported, that, although, an, eruption, did, not, appear, to, be, imminent, the, volcano, had, shown, elevated, signs, of, unrest, since, 2019, including, a, slight, increase, in, the, rate, of, inflation, at, the, volcano, s, summit, the, quiet, period, ended, at, 11, 30, pm, hst, on, november, 27, 2022, when, an, eruption, began, at, the, volcano, s, summit, in, moku, weoweo, mauna, loa, s, caldera, lava, flows, emanating, from, the, caldera, became, visible, from, kailua, kona, in, the, hours, immediately, following, the, eruption, the, eruption, remained, confined, to, the, caldera, until, approximately, 6, 30, am, hst, on, november, 28, when, the, hawaiian, volcano, observatory, observed, that, the, eruption, had, migrated, from, the, summit, to, the, northeast, rift, zone, three, fissures, were, initially, observed, in, the, rift, zone, with, the, first, two, becoming, inactive, by, 1, 30, pm, on, the, 28th, before, becoming, inactive, the, two, upper, fissures, fed, lava, flows, that, moved, downslope, however, those, flows, stalled, approximately, 11, miles, 18, km, from, saddle, road, lava, fountains, were, also, observed, emanating, from, the, fissures, with, the, tallest, reaching, up, to, 200, feet, 61, m, into, the, air, as, lava, flows, from, the, third, fissure, expanded, they, cut, off, the, road, to, the, mauna, loa, observatory, at, approximately, 8, pm, on, the, 28th, activity, in, the, rift, zone, continued, on, the, 29th, with, a, fourth, fissure, that, opened, at, approximately, 7, 30, pm, on, the, 28th, joining, the, third, in, releasing, lava, flows, the, main, front, of, the, third, fissure, s, lava, flows, also, continued, to, move, and, was, located, approximately, 2, 7, miles, 4, 3, km, from, saddle, road, at, 7, am, on, december, 2, as, the, eruption, approached, its, second, week, indications, of, a, reduction, in, activity, began, to, appear, on, december, 8, the, lava, flows, feeding, the, main, front, began, to, drain, and, the, main, flow, front, stalled, approximately, 1, 7, miles, 2, 7, km, from, saddle, road, the, flows, continued, to, drain, on, the, 9th, and, the, third, fissure, s, lava, fountains, also, began, to, grow, shorter, on, the, 10th, the, lava, fountains, were, replaced, by, a, lava, pond, and, the, stalled, flow, front, was, declared, to, no, longer, be, a, threat, based, on, these, factors, and, data, on, past, eruptions, the, hvo, determined, that, the, eruption, may, end, soon, and, reduced, the, volcano, alert, level, from, warning, to, watch, at, 2, 35, pm, on, the, 10th, however, there, was, a, small, possibility, that, the, eruption, would, continue, at, a, very, low, rate, the, eruption, officially, ended, at, 7, 17, am, on, the, 13th, and, the, hvo, lowered, the, volcano, alert, level, to, advisory, mauna, loa, has, been, designated, a, decade, volcano, one, of, the, sixteen, volcanoes, identified, by, the, international, association, of, volcanology, and, chemistry, of, the, earth, s, interior, iavcei, as, being, worthy, of, particular, study, in, light, of, their, history, of, large, destructive, eruptions, and, proximity, to, populated, areas, the, united, states, geological, survey, maintains, a, hazard, zone, mapping, of, the, island, done, on, a, one, to, nine, scale, with, the, most, dangerous, areas, corresponding, the, smallest, numbers, based, on, this, classification, mauna, loa, s, continuously, active, summit, caldera, and, rift, zones, have, been, given, a, level, one, designation, much, of, the, area, immediately, surrounding, the, rift, zones, is, considered, level, two, and, about, 20, percent, of, the, area, has, been, covered, in, lava, in, historical, times, much, of, the, remainder, of, the, volcano, is, hazard, level, three, about, 15, to, 20, percent, of, which, has, been, covered, by, flows, within, the, last, 750, years, however, two, sections, of, the, volcano, the, first, in, the, naalehu, area, and, the, second, on, the, southeastern, flank, of, mauna, loa, s, rift, zone, are, protected, from, eruptive, activity, by, local, topography, and, have, thus, been, designated, hazard, level, 6, comparable, with, a, similarly, isolated, segment, on, k, lauea, although, volcanic, eruptions, in, hawai, i, rarely, produce, casualties, the, only, direct, historical, fatality, due, to, volcanic, activity, on, the, island, occurred, at, k, lauea, in, 1924, when, an, unusually, explosive, eruption, hurled, rocks, at, an, onlooker, property, damage, due, to, inundation, by, lava, is, a, common, and, costly, hazard, hawaiian, type, eruptions, usually, produce, extremely, slow, moving, flows, that, advance, at, walking, pace, presenting, little, danger, to, human, life, but, this, is, not, strictly, the, case, mauna, loa, s, 1950, eruption, emitted, as, much, lava, in, three, weeks, as, k, lauea, s, recent, eruption, produced, in, three, years, and, reached, sea, level, within, four, hours, of, its, start, overrunning, the, village, of, ho, okena, mauka, and, a, major, highway, on, the, way, there, an, earlier, eruption, in, 1926, overran, the, village, of, ho, p, loa, makai, and, hilo, partly, built, on, lavas, from, the, 1880, 81, eruption, is, at, risk, from, future, eruptions, the, 1984, eruption, nearly, reached, the, city, but, stopped, short, after, the, flow, was, redirected, by, upstream, topography, a, potentially, greater, hazard, at, mauna, loa, is, a, sudden, massive, collapse, of, the, volcano, s, flanks, like, the, one, that, struck, the, volcano, s, west, flank, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, years, ago, and, formed, the, present, day, kealakekua, bay, deep, fault, lines, are, a, common, feature, on, hawaiian, volcanoes, allowing, large, portions, of, their, flanks, to, gradually, slide, downwards, and, forming, structures, like, the, hilina, slump, and, the, ancient, ninole, hills, large, earthquakes, could, trigger, rapid, flank, collapses, along, these, lines, creating, massive, landslides, and, possibly, triggering, equally, large, tsunamis, undersea, surveys, have, revealed, numerous, landslides, along, the, hawaiian, chain, and, evidence, of, two, such, giant, tsunami, events, 200, 000, years, ago, moloka, i, experienced, a, 75, m, 246, ft, tsunami, and, 100, 000, years, ago, a, megatsunami, 325, m, 1, 066, ft, high, struck, l, na, i, a, more, recent, example, of, the, risks, associated, with, slumps, occurred, in, 1975, when, the, hilina, slump, suddenly, lurched, forward, several, meters, triggering, a, 7, 2, m, w, earthquake, and, a, 14, m, 46, ft, tsunami, that, killed, two, campers, at, halape, established, on, k, lauea, in, 1912, the, hawaiian, volcano, observatory, hvo, presently, a, branch, of, the, united, states, geological, survey, is, the, primary, organization, associated, with, the, monitoring, observance, and, study, of, hawaiian, volcanoes, thomas, a, jaggar, the, observatory, s, founder, attempted, a, summit, expedition, to, mauna, loa, to, observe, its, 1914, eruption, but, was, rebuffed, by, the, arduous, trek, required, see, ascents, after, soliciting, help, from, lorrin, a, thurston, in, 1915, he, was, able, to, persuade, the, us, army, to, construct, a, simple, route, to, the, summit, for, public, and, scientific, use, a, project, completed, in, december, of, that, year, the, observatory, has, maintained, a, presence, on, the, volcano, ever, since, eruptions, on, mauna, loa, are, almost, always, preceded, and, accompanied, by, prolonged, episodes, of, seismic, activity, the, monitoring, of, which, was, the, primary, and, often, only, warning, mechanism, in, the, past, and, which, remains, viable, today, seismic, stations, have, been, maintained, on, hawai, i, since, the, observatory, s, inception, but, these, were, concentrated, primarily, on, k, lauea, with, coverage, on, mauna, loa, improving, only, slowly, through, the, 20th, century, following, the, invention, of, modern, monitoring, equipment, the, backbone, of, the, present, day, monitoring, system, was, installed, on, the, volcano, in, the, 1970s, mauna, loa, s, july, 1975, eruption, was, forewarned, by, more, than, a, year, of, seismic, unrest, with, the, hvo, issuing, warnings, to, the, general, public, from, late, 1974, the, 1984, eruption, was, similarly, preceded, by, as, much, as, three, years, of, unusually, high, seismic, activity, with, volcanologists, predicting, an, eruption, within, two, years, in, 1983, the, modern, monitoring, system, on, mauna, loa, consists, not, only, of, its, local, seismic, network, but, also, of, a, large, number, of, gps, stations, tiltmeters, and, strainmeters, that, have, been, anchored, on, the, volcano, to, monitor, ground, deformation, due, to, swelling, of, mauna, loa, s, subterranean, magma, chamber, which, presents, a, more, complete, picture, of, the, events, proceeding, eruptive, activity, the, gps, network, is, the, most, durable, and, wide, ranging, of, the, three, systems, while, the, tiltmeters, provide, the, most, sensitive, predictive, data, but, are, prone, to, erroneous, results, unrelated, to, actual, ground, deformation, nonetheless, a, survey, line, across, the, caldera, measured, a, 76, mm, 3, in, increase, in, its, width, over, the, year, preceding, the, 1975, eruption, and, a, similar, increase, in, 1984, eruption, strainmeters, by, contrast, are, relatively, rare, the, observatory, also, maintains, two, gas, detectors, at, moku, weoweo, mauna, loa, s, summit, caldera, as, well, as, a, publicly, accessible, live, webcam, and, occasional, screenings, by, interferometric, synthetic, aperture, radar, imaging, the, first, ancient, hawaiians, to, arrive, on, hawaii, island, lived, along, the, shores, where, food, and, water, were, plentiful, flightless, birds, that, had, previously, known, no, predators, became, a, staple, food, source, early, settlements, had, a, major, impact, on, the, local, ecosystem, and, caused, many, extinctions, particularly, amongst, bird, species, as, well, as, introducing, foreign, plants, and, animals, and, increasing, erosion, rates, the, prevailing, lowland, forest, ecosystem, was, transformed, from, forest, to, grassland, some, of, this, change, was, caused, by, the, use, of, fire, but, the, main, reason, appears, to, have, been, the, introduction, of, the, polynesian, rat, rattus, exulans, ancient, hawaiian, religious, practice, holds, that, the, five, volcanic, peaks, of, the, island, are, sacred, and, regards, mauna, loa, the, largest, of, them, all, with, great, admiration, but, what, mythology, survives, today, consists, mainly, of, oral, accounts, from, the, 18th, century, first, compiled, in, the, 19th, most, of, these, stories, agree, that, the, hawaiian, volcano, goddess, pele, resides, in, halema, uma, u, on, kilauea, however, a, few, place, her, home, at, mauna, loa, s, summit, caldera, moku, weoweo, and, the, mythos, in, general, associates, her, with, all, volcanic, activity, on, the, island, regardless, k, lauea, s, lack, of, a, geographic, outline, and, strong, volcanic, link, to, mauna, loa, led, to, it, being, considered, an, offshoot, of, mauna, loa, by, the, ancient, hawaiians, meaning, much, of, the, mythos, now, associated, with, k, lauea, was, originally, directed, at, mauna, loa, proper, as, well, 154, 155, ancient, hawaiians, constructed, an, extensive, trail, system, on, hawai, i, island, today, known, as, the, ala, kahakai, national, historic, trail, the, network, consisted, of, short, trailheads, servicing, local, areas, along, the, main, roads, and, more, extensive, networks, within, and, around, agricultural, centers, the, positioning, of, the, trails, was, practical, connecting, living, areas, to, farms, and, ports, and, regions, to, resources, with, a, few, upland, sections, reserved, for, gathering, and, most, lines, marked, well, enough, to, remain, identifiable, long, after, regular, use, had, ended, one, of, these, trails, the, ainapo, trail, ascended, from, the, village, of, kap, pala, over, 3, 400, m, 11, 155, ft, in, about, 56, km, 35, mi, and, ended, at, moku, weoweo, at, mauna, loa, s, summit, although, the, journey, was, arduous, and, required, several, days, and, many, porters, ancient, hawaiians, likely, made, the, journey, during, eruptions, to, leave, offerings, and, prayers, to, honor, pele, much, as, they, did, at, halema, uma, u, neighboring, kilauea, s, more, active, and, more, easily, accessible, caldera, several, camps, established, along, the, way, supplied, water, and, food, for, travelers, james, cook, s, third, voyage, was, the, first, to, make, landfall, on, hawai, i, island, in, 1778, and, following, adventures, along, the, north, american, west, coast, cook, returned, to, the, island, in, 1779, on, his, second, visit, john, ledyard, a, corporal, of, the, royal, marines, aboard, hms, resolution, proposed, and, received, approval, for, an, expedition, to, the, summit, mauna, loa, to, learn, about, that, part, of, the, island, particularly, the, peak, the, tip, of, which, is, generally, covered, with, snow, and, had, excited, great, curiosity, using, a, compass, ledyard, and, small, group, of, ships, mates, and, native, attendants, attempted, to, make, a, direct, course, for, the, summit, however, on, the, second, day, of, traveling, the, route, became, steeper, rougher, and, blocked, by, impenetrable, thickets, and, the, group, was, forced, to, abandon, their, attempt, and, return, to, kealakekua, bay, reckoning, they, had, penetrated, 24, miles, and, we, suppose, within, 11, miles, of, the, peak, in, reality, moku, weoweo, lies, only, 32, km, 20, mi, east, of, the, bay, a, severe, overestimation, on, ledyard, s, part, another, of, cook, s, men, lieutenant, james, king, estimated, the, peak, to, be, at, least, 5, 600, m, 18, 373, ft, high, based, on, its, snow, line, the, next, attempt, to, summit, mauna, loa, was, an, expedition, led, by, archibald, menzies, a, botanist, and, naturalist, on, the, 1793, vancouver, expedition, in, february, of, that, year, menzies, two, ships, mates, and, a, small, group, of, native, hawaiian, attendants, attempted, a, direct, course, for, the, summit, from, kealakekua, bay, making, it, 26, km, 16, mi, inland, by, their, reckoning, an, overestimation, before, they, were, turned, away, by, the, thickness, of, the, forest, on, a, second, visit, by, the, expedition, to, the, island, in, january, of, the, next, year, menzies, was, placed, in, charge, of, exploring, the, island, interior, and, after, traversing, the, flanks, of, hual, lai, he, and, his, party, arrived, at, the, high, plateau, separating, the, two, volcanoes, menzies, decided, to, make, a, second, attempt, above, the, objections, of, the, accompanying, island, chief, but, again, his, progress, was, arrested, by, unassailable, thickets, menzies, made, a, third, attempt, to, summit, mauna, loa, in, february, 1794, this, time, the, botanist, consulted, king, kamehameha, i, for, advice, and, learned, that, he, could, take, canoes, to, the, south, and, follow, the, ainap, trail, not, knowing, of, its, existence, beforehand, significantly, better, prepared, menzies, lieutenant, joseph, baker, and, midshipman, george, mckenzie, of, discovery, and, a, servant, most, likely, jonathan, ewins, listed, on, the, ship, s, muster, as, botanist, s, l, t, reached, the, summit, which, menzies, estimated, to, be, 4, 156, m, 13, 635, ft, high, with, the, aid, of, a, barometer, consistent, with, a, modern, value, of, 4, 169, m, 13, 678, ft, he, was, surprised, to, find, heavy, snow, and, morning, temperatures, of, 3, c, 27, f, and, was, unable, to, compare, the, heights, of, mauna, loa, and, kea, but, correctly, supposed, the, latter, to, be, taller, based, on, its, larger, snow, cap, the, feat, of, summitting, mauna, loa, was, not, to, be, repeated, for, forty, years, the, hawaiian, islands, were, the, site, of, fervent, missionary, work, with, the, first, group, of, missionaries, arrived, at, honolulu, in, 1820, and, the, second, in, 1823, some, of, these, missionaries, left, for, hawai, i, island, and, spent, ten, weeks, traveling, around, it, preaching, at, local, villages, and, climbing, kilauea, from, which, one, of, its, members, william, ellis, observed, mauna, loa, with, the, aid, of, a, telescope, and, ascertained, it, and, kea, to, be, perhaps, 15, 000, to, 16, 000, feet, above, the, level, of, the, sea, they, did, not, however, attempt, to, climb, the, volcano, itself, it, is, sometimes, reported, that, the, missionary, joseph, goodrich, reached, the, summit, around, this, time, but, he, never, claimed, this, himself, though, he, did, summit, mauna, kea, and, describe, moku, weoweo, with, the, aid, of, another, telescope, the, next, successful, ascent, was, made, on, january, 29, 1834, by, the, scottish, botanist, david, douglas, who, also, reached, the, summit, caldera, using, the, ainap, trail, by, the, time, douglas, reached, the, summit, the, environment, had, put, him, under, extreme, duress, but, he, nonetheless, stayed, overnight, to, make, measurements, of, the, summit, caldera, s, proportions, and, record, barometric, data, on, its, height, both, now, known, to, be, wildly, inaccurate, douglas, collected, biological, samples, on, the, way, both, up, and, down, and, after, a, difficult, and, distressing, descent, began, collating, his, samples, he, planned, to, return, to, england, but, instead, several, months, later, his, body, was, discovered, mysteriously, crushed, in, a, pit, beside, a, dead, wild, boar, isidor, l, wenstern, successfully, climbed, mauna, loa, in, february, 1839, only, the, third, successful, climb, in, 60, years, the, united, states, exploring, expedition, led, by, lieutenant, charles, wilkes, was, tasked, with, a, vast, survey, of, the, pacific, ocean, starting, in, 1838, in, september, 1840, they, arrived, in, honolulu, where, repairs, to, the, ships, took, longer, than, expected, wilkes, decided, to, spend, the, winter, in, hawaii, and, take, the, opportunity, to, explore, its, volcanoes, while, waiting, for, better, weather, to, continue, the, expedition, king, kamehameha, iii, assigned, american, medical, missionary, dr, gerrit, p, judd, to, the, expedition, as, a, translator, wilkes, sailed, to, hilo, on, the, island, of, hawai, i, and, decided, to, climb, mauna, loa, first, since, it, looked, easier, than, mauna, kea, on, december, 14, he, hired, about, 200, porters, but, after, he, left, he, realized, only, about, half, the, equipment, had, been, taken, so, he, had, to, hire, more, hawaiians, at, higher, pay, when, they, reached, k, lauea, after, two, days, their, guide, puhano, headed, off, to, the, established, ainap, trail, wilkes, did, not, want, to, head, back, downhill, so, he, blazed, his, own, way, through, dense, forest, directed, by, a, compass, the, hawaiians, were, offended, by, the, waste, of, sacred, trees, which, did, not, help, morale, at, about, 6, 000, feet, 1, 800, m, elevation, they, established, a, camp, called, sunday, station, at, the, edge, of, the, forest, two, guides, joined, them, at, sunday, station, keaweehu, the, bird, catcher, and, another, whose, hawaiian, name, is, not, recorded, called, ragsdale, although, wilkes, thought, he, was, almost, to, the, summit, the, guides, knew, they, were, less, than, halfway, up, since, there, was, no, water, at, sunday, station, porters, had, to, be, sent, back, ten, miles, 16, km, to, a, lava, tube, on, ainap, trail, which, had, a, known, supply, after, an, entire, day, replenishing, stocks, they, continued, up, to, a, second, camp, they, called, recruiting, station, at, about, 9, 000, feet, 2, 700, m, elevation, after, another, full, day, s, hike, they, established, flag, station, on, december, 22, and, by, this, time, were, on, the, ainap, trail, most, of, the, porters, were, sent, back, down, to, get, another, load, at, the, flag, station, wilkes, and, his, eight, remaining, men, built, a, circular, wall, of, lava, rocks, and, covered, the, shelter, with, a, canvas, tent, a, snowstorm, was, in, progress, and, several, suffered, from, altitude, sickness, that, night, december, 23, the, snow, on, the, canvas, roof, caused, it, to, collapse, at, daylight, some, of, the, group, went, down, the, trail, to, retrieve, firewood, and, the, gear, abandoned, on, the, trail, the, day, before, after, another, day, s, climb, nine, men, reached, the, rim, of, moku, weoweo, they, could, not, find, a, way, down, its, steep, sides, so, chose, a, smooth, place, on, the, rim, for, the, camp, site, at, coordinates, 19, 27, 59, n, 155, 34, 54, w, 19, 46639, n, 155, 58167, w, 19, 46639, 155, 58167, their, tent, was, pitched, within, 60, feet, 18, m, of, the, crater, s, edge, secured, by, lava, blocks, the, next, morning, they, were, unable, to, start, a, fire, using, friction, due, to, the, thin, air, at, that, altitude, and, sent, for, matches, by, this, time, the, naval, officers, and, hawaiians, could, not, agree, on, terms, to, continue, hiring, porters, so, sailors, and, marines, were, ordered, from, the, ships, dr, judd, traveled, between, the, summit, and, the, recruiting, station, to, tend, the, many, who, suffered, from, altitude, sickness, or, had, worn, out, their, shoes, on, the, rough, rock, christmas, day, was, spent, building, rock, walls, around, the, camp, to, give, some, protection, from, the, high, winds, and, blowing, snow, it, took, another, week, to, bring, all, the, equipment, to, the, summit, including, a, pendulum, designed, for, measuring, slight, variations, in, gravity, on, december, 31, 1840, the, pre, fabricated, pendulum, house, was, assembled, axes, and, chisels, cut, away, the, rock, surface, for, the, pendulum, s, base, it, took, another, three, days, to, adjust, the, clock, to, the, point, where, the, experiments, could, begin, however, the, high, winds, made, so, much, noise, that, the, ticks, could, often, not, be, heard, and, varied, the, temperature, to, make, measurements, inaccurate, grass, had, to, be, painstakingly, brought, from, the, lowest, elevations, for, insulation, to, get, accurate, measurements, on, monday, january, 11, wilkes, hiked, around, the, summit, crater, using, an, optical, method, he, estimated, mauna, kea, was, 193, feet, 59, m, higher, while, modern, measurements, indicate, a, difference, of, about, 125, feet, 38, m, on, january, 13, 1841, he, had, pendulum, peak, january, 1841, u, s, ex, ex, cut, into, a, rock, at, the, site, the, tents, were, dismantled, and, hawaiians, carried, the, gear, down, over, the, next, three, days, while, wilkes, enjoyed, a, lomilomi, massage, he, continued, his, measurements, at, lower, elevations, and, left, the, island, on, march, 5, for, all, the, effort, he, did, not, obtain, any, significant, results, attributing, gravity, discrepancies, to, the, tides, the, wilkes, expedition, s, camp, site, s, ruins, are, the, only, known, physical, evidence, in, the, pacific, of, the, u, s, exploring, expedition, the, camp, site, was, listed, on, the, national, register, of, historic, places, on, july, 24, 1974, as, site, 74000295, and, is, state, historic, site, 10, 52, 5507, a, summit, shelter, was, built, with, some, of, the, stones, from, wilkes, camp, site, and, mortar, in, 1934, in, 1916, moku, weoweo, was, included, in, hawaii, volcanoes, national, park, and, a, new, trail, was, built, directly, from, park, headquarters, at, k, lauea, an, even, more, direct, route, than, the, one, taken, by, wilkes, this, trail, arriving, at, the, summit, from, the, east, via, red, hill, became, the, preferred, route, due, to, its, easier, access, and, gentler, slope, the, historic, ainap, trail, fell, into, disuse, and, was, reopened, in, the, 1990s, a, third, modern, route, to, the, summit, is, from, the, saddle, road, up, to, the, mauna, loa, observatory, which, is, at, 11, 135, feet, 3, 394, m, elevation, a, few, miles, north, of, moku, weoweo, and, the, north, pit, trail, trade, winds, blow, from, east, to, west, across, the, hawaiian, islands, and, the, presence, of, mauna, loa, strongly, affects, the, local, climate, at, low, elevations, the, eastern, windward, side, of, the, volcano, receives, heavy, rain, hilo, is, the, wettest, city, in, hawaii, and, the, fourth, wettest, city, in, the, united, states, behind, the, southeast, alaskan, cities, of, whittier, ketchikan, and, yakutat, the, rainfall, supports, extensive, forestation, the, western, leeward, side, has, a, much, drier, climate, at, higher, elevations, the, amount, of, precipitation, decreases, and, skies, are, very, often, clear, very, low, temperatures, mean, that, precipitation, often, occurs, in, the, form, of, snow, and, the, summit, of, mauna, loa, is, described, as, a, periglacial, region, where, freezing, and, thawing, play, a, significant, role, in, shaping, the, landscape, mauna, loa, has, a, tropical, climate, with, warm, temperatures, at, lower, elevations, and, cool, to, cold, temperatures, higher, up, year, round, below, is, the, table, for, the, slope, observatory, which, is, at, 11, 150, feet, 3, 400, m, in, the, alpine, zone, the, highest, recorded, temperature, was, 78, f, 26, c, and, the, lowest, was, 18, f, 8, c, on, september, 26, 1990, and, february, 20, 1962, respectively, see, or, edit, raw, graph, data, the, location, of, mauna, loa, has, made, it, an, important, location, for, atmospheric, monitoring, by, the, global, atmosphere, watch, and, other, scientific, observations, the, mauna, loa, solar, observatory, mlso, located, at, 11, 155, feet, 3, 400, m, on, the, northern, slope, of, the, mountain, has, long, been, prominent, in, observations, of, the, sun, the, noaa, mauna, loa, observatory, mlo, is, located, close, by, from, its, location, well, above, local, human, generated, influences, the, mlo, monitors, the, global, atmosphere, including, the, greenhouse, gas, carbon, dioxide, measurements, are, adjusted, to, account, for, local, outgassing, of, co, 2, from, the, volcano, the, yuan, tseh, lee, array, for, microwave, background, anisotropy, amiba, sits, at, an, elevation, of, 11, 155, feet, 3, 400, m, it, was, established, in, october, 2006, by, the, academia, sinica, institute, of, astronomy, and,
