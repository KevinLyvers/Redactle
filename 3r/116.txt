the, aral, sea, r, l, was, an, endorheic, lake, that, is, without, an, outlet, lying, between, kazakhstan, to, its, north, and, uzbekistan, to, its, south, which, began, shrinking, in, the, 1960s, and, largely, dried, up, by, the, 2010s, it, was, in, the, aktobe, and, kyzylorda, regions, of, kazakhstan, and, the, karakalpakstan, autonomous, region, of, uzbekistan, the, name, roughly, translates, from, mongolic, and, turkic, languages, to, sea, of, islands, a, reference, to, the, large, number, of, islands, over, 1, 100, that, once, dotted, its, waters, the, aral, sea, drainage, basin, encompasses, uzbekistan, and, parts, of, afghanistan, iran, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, and, turkmenistan, formerly, the, third, largest, lake, in, the, world, with, an, area, of, 68, 000, km, 2, 26, 300, sq, mi, the, aral, sea, began, shrinking, in, the, 1960s, after, the, rivers, that, fed, it, were, diverted, by, soviet, irrigation, projects, by, 2007, it, had, declined, to, 10, of, its, original, size, splitting, into, four, lakes, the, north, aral, sea, the, eastern, and, western, basins, of, the, once, far, larger, south, aral, sea, and, the, smaller, intermediate, barsakelmes, lake, by, 2009, the, southeastern, lake, had, disappeared, and, the, southwestern, lake, had, retreated, to, a, thin, strip, at, the, western, edge, of, the, former, southern, sea, in, subsequent, years, occasional, water, flows, have, led, to, the, southeastern, lake, sometimes, being, replenished, to, a, small, degree, satellite, images, by, nasa, in, august, 2014, revealed, that, for, the, first, time, in, modern, history, the, eastern, basin, of, the, aral, sea, had, completely, dried, up, the, eastern, basin, is, now, called, the, aralkum, desert, in, an, effort, in, kazakhstan, to, save, and, replenish, the, north, aral, sea, the, dike, kokaral, dam, was, completed, in, 2005, by, 2008, the, water, level, had, risen, 12, m, 39, ft, above, that, of, 2003, to, 42, m, 138, ft, as, of, 2013, salinity, dropped, and, fish, were, again, present, in, sufficient, numbers, for, some, fishing, to, be, viable, after, the, visit, to, muynak, in, 2011, former, united, nations, secretary, general, ban, ki, moon, called, the, shrinking, of, the, aral, sea, one, of, the, planet, s, worst, environmental, disasters, the, region, s, once, prosperous, fishing, industry, has, been, devastated, bringing, unemployment, and, economic, hardship, the, water, from, the, diverted, syr, darya, river, is, used, to, irrigate, about, two, million, hectares, 5, 000, 000, acres, of, farmland, in, the, ferghana, valley, the, aral, sea, region, is, heavily, polluted, with, consequent, serious, public, health, problems, unesco, has, added, historical, documents, concerning, the, aral, sea, to, its, memory, of, the, world, register, as, a, resource, to, study, the, environmental, tragedy, the, amu, darya, river, flowed, into, the, caspian, sea, via, the, uzboy, channel, until, the, holocene, geographer, nick, middleton, believes, it, did, not, begin, to, flow, into, the, aral, sea, until, that, time, despite, its, former, vast, size, the, aral, sea, had, relatively, low, indigenous, biodiversity, however, the, aral, sea, basin, had, an, exceptional, array, of, endemic, fish, subspecies, as, well, as, the, three, endemic, sturgeon, species, most, of, these, still, survive, in, the, north, aral, sea, but, some, such, as, the, sturgeons, have, been, greatly, reduced, or, even, driven, to, extirpation, by, the, lake, s, shrinkage, native, fish, species, of, the,

drying, of, the, lake, led, to, the, local, extinction, of, the, aral, trout, ruffe, turkestan, barbel, and, all, sturgeon, species, and, dams, now, block, their, return, and, migration, routes, the, aral, trout, and, syr, darya, sturgeon, pseudoscaphirhynchus, fedtschenkoi, may, be, extinct, due, to, their, restricted, range, all, other, native, fish, barring, the, stickleback, which, persisted, during, the, lake, s, shrinkage, and, salinity, increase, were, also, extirpated, but, many, have, returned, to, the, north, aral, sea, following, its, recovery, from, the, 1990s, onwards, other, salt, tolerant, fish, species, were, intentionally, or, inadvertently, introduced, during, the, 1960s, when, hydropower, and, irrigation, projects, reduced, the, flow, of, fresh, water, thereby, increasing, salinity, these, include, the, baltic, herring, clupea, harengus, membras, big, scale, sand, smelt, atherina, boyeri, caspia, black, striped, pipefish, syngnatus, abaster, caspius,

channa, argus, warpachowski, the, herring, sand, smelt, and, gobies, were, the, first, planktivorous, fish, in, the, lake, leading, to, a, collapse, of, the, lake, s, zooplankton, population, this, in, turn, caused, a, collapse, of, the, herring, and, sand, smelt, population, from, which, neither, species, has, recovered, all, introduced, species, aside, from, the, carp, snakehead, and, possibly, pipefish, survived, the, lake, s, shrinkage, and, salinity, increase, and, during, this, time, the, european, flounder, platichthys, flesus, was, introduced, to, revive, fisheries, the, extirpated, species, aside, from, possibly, the, pipefish, returned, to, the, north, aral, sea, following, its, recovery, herring, sand, smelt, gobies, and, flounder, persisted, in, the, south, aral, sea, until, increasing, salinity, extirpated, all, but, the, gobies, prior, to, its, shrinkage, the, aral, sea, had, about, 250, species, of, native, aquatic, invertebrates, the, majority, about, 80, being, freshwater, species, the, rest, were, marine, invertebrates, with, ties, to, the, ponto, caspian, and, mediterranean, atlantic, fauna, the, dominant, species, excluding, protozoa, were, rotifers, cladocerans, and, copepods, advanced, crustaceans, malacostraca, were, represented, by, a, single, amphipod, species, dikerogammarus, aralensis, an, endemic, of, the, syr, darya, basin, there, were, several, native, bivalves, in, the, aral, sea, including, members, of, the, genera, dreissena, including, an, endemic, subspecies, of, zebra, mussel, dreissena, polymorpha, aralensis, hypanis, and, the, lagoon, cockle, cerastoderma, glaucum, formerly, considered, distinct, species, cerastoderma, rhomboides, and, c, isthmica, native, gastropods, included, theodoxus, pallasi, and, a, member, of, caspiohydrobia, many, of, these, invertebrates, had, their, numbers, drastically, reduced, due, to, the, introduced, fish, species, later, during, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, introduce, mullet, mugil, sp, to, the, aral, from, the, caspian, sea, the, rockpool, shrimp, palaemon, elegans, was, inadvertently, introduced, to, the, sea, the, shrimp, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, extirpation, of, the, near, endemic, amphipod, dikerogammarus, aralensis, which, now, survives, only, in, the, syr, darya, basin, the, copepod, calanipeda, aquaedulcis, was, introduced, to, the, aral, to, replace, the, zooplankton, species, reduced, by, the, herring, population, and, the, north, american, mud, crab, rhithropanopeus, harrisii, was, inadvertently, introduced, during, this, attempt, as, well, later, as, the, lake, s, salinity, increased, many, of, the, freshwater, adapted, species, disappeared, only, leaving, behind, the, marine, and, saline, species, however, the, zooplankton, population, in, the, north, aral, sea, has, recovered, as, salinity, has, decreased, from, the, 1990s, onwards, with, extirpated, crustacean, and, rotifer, species, returning, naturally, via, the, syr, darya, river, at, the, expense, of, the, saltwater, species, the, cladoceran, moina, mongolica, extirpated, by, the, introduced, fish, species, has, also, returned, the, zebra, mussel, dreissena, polymorpha, aralensis, has, been, reintroduced, in, contrast, in, the, south, aral, sea, only, a, few, nematodes, rotifers, and, parthenogenic, brine, shrimp, artemia, parthenogenetica, exist, the, future, prospects, for, aquatic, invertebrates, in, all, remaining, aral, sea, fragments, depend, on, their, future, changes, in, salinity, climate, shifts, have, driven, multiple, phases, of, sea, level, rise, and, fall, inflow, rates, from, the, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, are, affected, by, glacial, melt, rates, at, the, rivers, headwaters, as, well, as, precipitation, within, the, river, basins, cold, dry, climates, restrict, both, processes, geologically, driven, shifts, in, the, course, of, the, amu, darya, between, the, aral, sea, and, the, sarykamysh, basins, and, anthropogenic, water, withdrawal, from, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, have, caused, fluctuations, in, the, aral, sea, s, water, level, artificial, irrigation, systems, began, in, ancient, times, and, continue, to, the, present, the, aral, sea, was, part, of, the, western, frontier, of, the, chinese, empire, during, the, tang, dynasty, muslim, geographers, such, as, hafiz, i, abru, wrote, about, the, disappearance, of, the, aral, sea, in, 1417, due, to, diversions, in, both, the, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, the, russian, expedition, of, alexey, butakov, performed, the, first, observations, of, the, aral, sea, in, 1848, the, first, steamer, arrived, in, the, aral, sea, three, years, later, the, aral, sea, fishing, industry, began, with, the, renowned, russian, dealers, lapshin, ritkin, krasilnikov, and, makeev, which, later, formed, major, fishing, unions, russian, naval, presence, on, the, aral, sea, began, in, 1847, with, the, founding, of, raimsk, soon, renamed, fort, aralsk, near, the, mouth, of, the, syr, darya, as, the, aral, sea, basin, is, not, connected, to, other, bodies, of, water, the, imperial, russian, navy, deployed, its, vessels, by, disassembling, them, in, orenburg, on, the, ural, river, and, transporting, them, overland, to, be, reassembled, at, aralsk, the, first, two, ships, assembled, in, 1847, were, the, two, masted, schooners, nikolai, and, mikhail, the, former, was, a, warship, the, latter, a, merchant, vessel, to, establish, fisheries, they, surveyed, the, northern, part, of, the, sea, in, 1848, the, same, year, that, a, larger, warship, the, constantine, was, assembled, commanded, by, lt, alexey, butakov, the, constantine, completed, the, survey, of, the, entire, aral, sea, over, the, next, two, years, exiled, ukrainian, poet, and, painter, taras, shevchenko, participated, in, the, expedition, and, produced, a, number, of, sketches, in, 1851, two, newly, built, steamers, arrived, from, sweden, the, geological, surveys, had, found, no, coal, deposits, in, the, area, so, the, military, governor, general, of, orenburg, vasily, perovsky, ordered, an, as, large, as, possible, supply, of, saxaul, haloxylon, ammodendron, a, desert, shrub, akin, to, the, creosote, bush, to, be, collected, in, aralsk, for, the, new, steamers, saxaul, wood, proved, not, to, be, a, suitable, fuel, and, in, the, later, years, the, aral, flotilla, was, provisioned, at, substantial, cost, by, coal, from, the, donbas, in, the, early, 1960s, as, part, of, the, soviet, government, plan, for, cotton, or, white, gold, to, become, a, major, export, the, amu, darya, river, in, the, south, and, the, syr, darya, river, in, the, east, were, diverted, from, feeding, the, aral, sea, to, irrigate, the, desert, in, an, attempt, to, grow, cotton, melons, rice, and, cereals, this, temporarily, succeeded, and, in, 1988, uzbekistan, was, the, world, s, largest, exporter, of, cotton, cotton, production, is, still, uzbekistan, s, main, cash, crop, accounting, for, 17, of, its, exports, in, 2006, large, scale, construction, of, irrigation, canals, began, in, the, 1930s, and, was, greatly, increased, in, the, 1960s, many, canals, were, poorly, built, allowing, leakage, and, evaporation, between, 30, and, 75, of, the, water, from, the, qaraqum, canal, the, largest, in, central, asia, went, to, waste, it, was, estimated, in, 2012, that, only, 12, of, uzbekistan, s, irrigation, canal, length, was, waterproofed, only, 28, of, interfarm, irrigation, channels, and, 21, of, onfarm, channels, have, anti, infiltration, linings, which, retain, on, average, 15, more, water, than, unlined, channels, only, 77, of, farm, intakes, have, flow, gauges, by, 1960, between, 20, and, 60, km, 3, 4, 8, and, 14, 4, cu, mi, of, water, each, year, was, going, to, the, land, instead, of, the, aral, sea, and, the, sea, began, to, shrink, from, 1961, to, 1970, the, aral, s, level, fell, an, average, of, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, per, year, in, the, 1970s, the, rate, nearly, tripled, to, 50, 60, cm, 20, 24, in, per, annum, and, in, the, 1980s, to, 80, 90, cm, 31, 35, in, per, annum, the, amount, of, water, taken, for, irrigation, from, the, rivers, doubled, between, 1960, and, 2000, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, prior, to, the, irrigation, the, sea, s, water, level, above, sea, level, held, steady, at, 53, m, by, 2010, the, large, aral, was, 27, m, and, the, small, aral, 43, m, above, sea, level, the, disappearance, of, the, lake, was, no, surprise, to, the, soviets, they, expected, it, to, happen, long, before, as, early, as, 1964, aleksandr, asarin, at, the, hydroproject, institute, pointed, out, that, the, lake, was, doomed, explaining, it, was, part, of, the, five, year, plans, approved, by, the, council, of, ministers, and, the, politburo, nobody, on, a, lower, level, would, dare, to, say, a, word, contradicting, those, plans, even, if, it, was, the, fate, of, the, aral, sea, the, reaction, to, the, predictions, varied, some, soviet, experts, apparently, considered, the, aral, to, be, nature, s, error, and, a, soviet, engineer, said, in, 1968, it, is, obvious, to, everyone, that, the, evaporation, of, the, aral, sea, is, inevitable, on, the, other, hand, starting, in, the, 1960s, a, large, scale, project, was, proposed, to, redirect, part, of, the, flow, of, the, rivers, of, the, ob, basin, to, central, asia, over, a, gigantic, canal, system, refilling, of, the, aral, sea, was, considered, one, of, the, project, s, main, goals, however, due, to, its, staggering, costs, and, the, negative, public, opinion, in, russia, proper, the, federal, authorities, had, abandoned, the, project, by, 1986, from, 1960, to, 1998, the, sea, s, surface, area, shrank, by, 60, and, its, volume, by, 80, in, 1960, the, aral, sea, had, been, the, world, s, fourth, largest, lake, with, an, area, of, 68, 000, km, 2, 26, 000, sq, mi, and, a, volume, of, 1, 100, km, 3, 260, cu, mi, by, 1998, it, had, dropped, to, 28, 687, km, 2, 11, 076, sq, mi, and, eighth, largest, its, salinity, increased, having, originally, been, 10, g, l, by, 1990, it, was, at, 376, g, l, by, comparison, seawater, is, typically, 35, g, l, and, the, dead, sea, between, 300, and, 350, g, l, in, 1987, the, lake, split, into, two, separate, bodies, of, water, the, north, aral, sea, the, lesser, sea, or, small, aral, sea, and, the, south, aral, sea, the, greater, sea, or, large, aral, sea, in, june, 1991, uzbekistan, gained, independence, from, the, soviet, union, craig, murray, uk, ambassador, to, uzbekistan, in, 2002, attributes, the, shrinkage, of, the, aral, sea, in, the, 1990s, to, president, islam, karimov, s, cotton, policy, the, enormous, irrigation, system, was, massively, wasteful, crop, rotation, was, not, used, and, huge, quantities, of, pesticides, and, fertilizer, were, applied, the, runoff, from, the, fields, washed, these, chemicals, into, the, shrinking, sea, creating, severe, pollution, and, health, problems, as, demand, for, cotton, increased, the, government, applied, more, pesticides, and, fertilizer, to, the, monocultured, and, depleted, soil, forced, labor, was, used, and, profits, were, siphoned, off, by, the, powerful, and, well, connected, in, 2003, the, south, aral, further, divided, into, eastern, and, western, basins, the, waters, in, the, deepest, parts, of, the, sea, were, saltier, and, didn, t, mix, with, the, top, waters, so, only, the, top, of, the, sea, was, heated, in, the, summer, resulting, in, faster, evaporation, than, had, been, predicted, a, plan, was, announced, for, the, recovery, of, the, north, aral, sea, by, building, dike, kokaral, a, concrete, dam, separating, the, two, halves, of, the, aral, sea, in, 2004, the, sea, s, surface, area, was, 17, 160, km, 2, 6, 630, sq, mi, 25, of, its, original, size, and, a, nearly, fivefold, increase, in, salinity, had, killed, most, of, its, flora, and, fauna, dike, kokaral, was, completed, in, 2005, and, as, of, 2006, some, recovery, of, sea, level, had, been, recorded, the, aral, sea, is, considered, an, example, of, ecosystem, collapse, the, ecosystems, of, the, aral, sea, and, the, river, deltas, feeding, into, it, have, been, nearly, destroyed, largely, because, of, the, salinity, being, dramatically, higher, than, ocean, water, the, receding, sea, has, left, huge, plains, covered, with, salt, and, toxic, chemicals, from, weapons, testing, industrial, projects, and, runoff, of, pesticides, and, fertilizer, because, of, the, shrinking, water, source, and, worsening, water, and, soil, quality, pesticides, were, increasingly, used, from, the, 1960s, to, raise, cotton, yield, which, further, polluted, the, water, with, toxins, e, g, hch, tccd, ddt, industrial, pollution, also, resulted, in, pcb, and, heavy, metal, contamination, owing, to, the, insufficiency, of, water, left, in, the, aral, sea, concentrations, of, these, pollutants, rose, drastically, both, in, the, remaining, water, and, in, the, dry, beds, this, resulted, in, wind, borne, toxic, dust, that, spread, quite, widely, people, living, in, the, lower, parts, of, the, river, basins, and, former, shore, zones, ingested, pollutants, through, drinking, local, water, and, inhaling, contaminated, dust, furthermore, due, to, absorption, by, plants, and, livestock, toxins, many, of, which, bioaccumulate, and, are, not, easily, broken, down, or, excreted, by, the, liver, and, kidneys, entered, the, food, chain, inhabitants, of, the, surrounding, areas, commonly, experience, a, shortage, of, fresh, water, and, health, problems, are, widespread, including, high, rates, of, certain, cancers, respiratory, illnesses, including, tuberculosis, mostly, drug, resistant, digestive, disorders, anaemia, and, infectious, diseases, liver, kidney, and, eye, problems, may, also, be, due, to, the, toxic, dust, storms, together, this, presented, an, unusually, high, fatality, rate, among, vulnerable, age, groups, child, mortality, stood, at, 75, per, 1, 000, in, 2009, while, maternal, mortality, was, 12, in, every, 1, 000, the, dust, storms, have, also, contributed, to, water, shortages, through, salt, deposition, overusing, pesticides, on, crops, to, preserve, yields, has, exacerbated, this, crops, are, destroyed, where, salt, is, deposited, by, the, wind, the, most, heavily, affected, fields, must, be, flushed, with, water, four, times, per, day, to, remove, salt, and, toxic, matter, a, 1998, study, indicated, that, few, crops, besides, fodder, tolerate, the, degradation, restricting, what, kazakhstan, farmers, now, choose, to, seed, inland, seas, and, lakes, generally, moderate, a, region, s, climate, through, humidification, regulation, of, thermal, energy, and, peri, winter, albedo, effects, loss, of, water, in, the, aral, sea, has, changed, surface, temperatures, and, wind, patterns, this, has, led, to, a, broader, annual, temperature, range, about, a, 4, to, 12, c, broadening, and, more, dust, in, storms, locally, and, regionally, the, aral, sea, fishing, industry, which, at, its, peak, employed, some, 40, 000, and, reportedly, produced, one, sixth, of, the, soviet, union, s, entire, fish, catch, has, been, devastated, in, the, 1980s, commercial, harvests, were, becoming, unsustainable, and, by, 1987, commercial, harvest, became, nonexistent, due, to, the, declining, sea, levels, salinity, levels, became, too, high, for, the, 20, native, fish, species, to, survive, the, only, fish, that, could, survive, the, high, salinity, levels, was, flounder, also, as, water, has, receded, former, fishing, towns, along, the, original, shores, have, become, ship, graveyards, aral, originally, the, main, fishing, port, is, now, about, 15, kilometres, from, the, sea, and, has, seen, its, population, decline, dramatically, since, the, beginning, of, the, crisis, the, town, of, moynaq, in, uzbekistan, had, a, thriving, harbour, and, fishing, industry, that, employed, about, 30, 000, people, now, it, lies, 30, 90, kilometres, from, the, shore, fishing, boats, lie, scattered, on, the, dry, dusty, land, that, was, once, covered, by, water, many, have, been, there, for, 20, years, the, south, aral, sea, remains, too, saline, to, host, any, species, other, than, halotolerant, organisms, the, south, aral, has, been, incapable, of, supporting, fish, since, the, late, 1990s, when, the, flounder, were, killed, by, rising, salinity, levels, also, destroyed, is, the, muskrat, trapping, industry, in, the, deltas, of, the, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, which, used, to, yield, as, many, as, 500, 000, pelts, a, year, women, and, children, are, the, most, vulnerable, populations, in, this, environmental, health, crisis, due, to, the, highly, polluted, and, salinated, water, used, for, drinking, and, the, dried, seabed, toxic, chemicals, associated, with, pesticide, use, have, been, found, in, blood, and, breast, milk, of, mothers, specifically, organochlorides, polychlorinated, biphenyl, compounds, pcbs, ddt, compounds, and, tcdd, these, toxins, can, be, and, often, are, passed, on, to, the, children, of, these, mothers, resulting, in, low, birthweight, and, congenital, abnormalities, the, rate, of, infants, being, born, with, abnormalities, is, five, times, higher, in, this, region, than, in, european, countries, the, aral, sea, region, has, 26, of, its, children, born, at, low, birthweight, which, is, two, standard, deviations, away, from, a, national, population, study, gathered, by, the, who, exposures, to, toxic, chemicals, from, the, dry, seabed, and, polluted, water, have, caused, other, health, issues, in, women, and, children, renal, tubular, dysfunction, has, become, a, large, health, concern, in, children, in, the, aral, sea, region, as, it, is, showing, extremely, high, prevalence, rates, renal, tubular, dysfunction, can, also, be, related, to, growth, and, developmental, stunting, this, in, conjunction, with, the, already, high, rate, of, low, birthweight, children, and, children, born, with, abnormalities, contributes, to, severe, negative, health, effects, and, outcomes, for, children, these, issues, are, compounded, by, the, lack, of, research, on, maternal, and, child, health, effects, caused, by, the, demise, of, the, aral, sea, for, example, only, 26, english, language, peer, reviewed, articles, and, four, reports, on, children, s, health, were, produced, between, 1994, and, 2008, in, addition, there, is, a, lack, of, health, infrastructure, and, resources, in, the, aral, sea, region, to, combat, the, health, issues, that, have, arisen, there, is, a, lack, of, medication, and, equipment, in, many, medical, facilities, so, health, professionals, do, not, have, access, to, the, necessary, supplies, to, do, their, jobs, in, the, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, regions, there, is, also, meager, development, of, a, health, information, system, that, would, allow, for, extensive, research, or, surveillance, of, emerging, health, issues, due, to, aral, sea, issues, an, absence, of, a, primary, care, approach, in, the, health, systems, of, this, region, also, hinders, services, and, access, that, could, prevent, and, treat, issues, stemming, from, the, aral, sea, crisis, especially, in, women, and, children, the, impoverished, are, also, particularly, vulnerable, to, the, environmental, and, health, related, effects, of, changes, to, the, aral, sea, these, populations, were, most, likely, to, reside, downstream, from, the, basin, and, in, former, coastal, communities, they, were, also, among, the, first, to, be, detrimentally, affected, representing, at, least, 4, 4, million, people, in, the, region, considered, to, have, the, worst, health, in, this, region, their, plight, was, not, helped, when, their, fishery, livelihoods, vanished, with, the, decreasing, levels, of, water, and, loss, of, many, aquatic, species, thus, those, in, poverty, are, entrenched, in, a, vicious, cycle, many, different, solutions, to, the, problems, have, been, suggested, over, the, years, varying, in, feasibility, and, cost, including, in, january, 1994, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, turkmenistan, tajikistan, and, kyrgyzstan, signed, a, deal, to, pledge, 1, of, their, budgets, to, help, the, sea, recover, in, march, 2000, unesco, presented, their, water, related, vision, for, the, aral, sea, basin, for, the, year, 2025, by, 2006, the, world, bank, s, restoration, projects, especially, in, the, north, aral, were, giving, rise, to, some, unexpected, tentative, relief, in, what, had, been, an, extremely, pessimistic, picture, funded, in, part, by, the, undp, implementations, in, kazakhstan, such, as, laser, levelling, and, irrigation, optimization, using, energy, efficient, technologies, has, shown, effectiveness, the, future, of, the, aral, sea, and, the, responsibility, for, its, survival, are, now, in, the, hands, of, the, five, countries, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, kyrgyzstan, and, turkmenistan, in, 1994, they, adopted, the, aral, sea, basin, programme, the, programme, s, four, objectives, are, the, first, phase, of, the, plan, effectively, began, with, the, first, involvement, from, the, world, bank, in, 1992, and, was, in, operation, until, 1997, it, was, ineffectual, for, a, number, of, reasons, but, mainly, because, it, was, focused, on, improving, directly, the, land, around, the, aral, sea, whilst, not, intervening, in, the, water, usage, upstream, there, was, considerable, concern, amongst, the, central, asian, governments, which, realised, the, importance, of, the, aral, sea, in, the, ecosystem, and, the, economy, of, central, asia, and, they, were, prepared, to, cooperate, but, they, found, it, difficult, to, implement, the, procedures, of, the, plan, this, is, due, in, part, to, a, lack, of, co, operation, among, the, affected, people, the, water, flowing, into, the, aral, sea, has, long, been, considered, an, important, commodity, and, trade, agreements, have, been, made, to, supply, the, downstream, communities, with, water, in, the, spring, and, summer, months, for, irrigation, in, return, they, supply, the, upstream, countries, with, fuel, during, the, winter, instead, of, storing, water, during, the, warm, months, for, hydroelectric, purposes, in, winter, however, very, few, legal, obligations, are, binding, these, contracts, particularly, on, an, international, stage, phase, two, of, the, aral, sea, basin, programme, followed, in, 1998, and, ran, for, five, years, the, main, shortcomings, of, phase, two, were, due, to, its, lack, of, integration, with, the, local, communities, involved, the, scheme, was, drawn, up, by, the, world, bank, government, representatives, and, various, technical, experts, without, consulting, those, who, would, be, affected, an, example, of, this, was, the, public, awareness, initiatives, which, were, seen, as, propagandist, attempts, by, people, with, little, care, or, understanding, of, their, situation, these, failures, have, led, to, the, introduction, of, a, new, plan, funded, by, a, number, of, institutions, including, the, five, countries, involved, and, the, world, bank, in, 1997, a, new, plan, was, conceived, which, would, continue, with, the, previous, restoration, efforts, of, the, aral, sea, the, main, aims, of, this, phase, are, to, improve, the, irrigation, systems, currently, in, place, whilst, targeting, water, management, at, a, local, level, the, largest, project, in, this, phase, is, the, north, aral, sea, project, a, direct, effort, to, recover, the, northern, region, of, the, aral, sea, the, north, aral, sea, project, s, main, initiative, is, the, construction, of, a, dam, across, the, berg, strait, a, deep, channel, which, connects, the, north, aral, sea, to, the, south, aral, sea, the, kok, aral, dam, is, 13, kilometres, 8, miles, long, and, has, capacity, for, over, 29, cubic, kilometres, of, water, to, be, stored, in, the, north, aral, sea, whilst, allowing, excess, to, overflow, into, the, south, aral, sea, on, 6, october, 2002, the, heads, of, states, met, again, to, revise, the, asbp, program, asbp, 2, was, in, place, from, 2003, to, 2010, the, main, purpose, of, the, asbp, 2, was, to, set, up, projects, that, covered, a, vast, amount, of, environmental, socioeconomic, and, water, management, issues, the, asbp, 2, was, financed, by, organization, such, as, the, undp, world, bank, usaid, asian, development, bank, and, the, governments, of, switzerland, japan, finland, norway, and, others, over, 2, billion, us, dollars, was, provided, by, the, ifas, country, members, to, the, program, on, 28, april, 2009, the, head, of, states, came, together, with, the, interstate, commission, for, water, coordination, interstate, commission, for, sustainable, development, and, national, experts, and, donors, to, develop, the, asbp, 3, this, program, was, in, effect, from, 2011, 2015, the, main, purpose, of, the, asbp, 3, was, to, improve, the, environmental, and, socio, economic, situation, of, the, aral, sea, basin, the, four, program, priorities, were, direction, one, s, main, purpose, is, to, propose, program, that, focus, on, addressing, transboundary, water, resources, management, establishment, of, monitoring, systems, and, addressing, safety, concerns, in, water, facilities, examples, of, programs, that, have, been, proposed, include, directions, two, s, main, focus, is, on, addressing, the, issues, related, to, environmental, protection, and, improvement, of, the, environment, areas, of, interest, include, direction, three, looks, to, address, socio, economic, issues, by, focusing, on, education, and, public, health, improving, unemployment, rates, improving, water, systems, increasing, sustainable, development, and, improving, living, conditions, the, expected, outputs, are, direction, four, aims, to, address, issues, related, to, institutional, development, and, the, development, of, policies, and, strategies, that, relate, to, sustainable, development, and, public, awareness, expected, outputs, include, work, is, being, done, to, restore, in, part, the, north, aral, sea, irrigation, works, on, the, syr, darya, have, been, repaired, and, improved, to, increase, its, water, flow, and, in, october, 2003, the, kazakh, government, announced, a, plan, to, build, dike, kokaral, a, concrete, dam, separating, the, two, halves, of, the, aral, sea, work, on, this, dam, was, completed, in, august, 2005, since, then, the, water, level, of, the, north, aral, has, risen, and, its, salinity, has, decreased, as, of, 2006, some, recovery, of, sea, level, has, been, recorded, sooner, than, expected, the, dam, has, caused, the, small, aral, s, sea, level, to, rise, swiftly, to, 38, m, 125, ft, from, a, low, of, less, than, 30, m, 98, ft, with, 42, m, 138, ft, considered, the, level, of, viability, economically, significant, stocks, of, fish, have, returned, and, observers, who, had, written, off, the, north, aral, sea, as, an, environmental, disaster, were, surprised, by, unexpected, reports, that, in, 2006, its, returning, waters, were, already, partly, reviving, the, fishing, industry, and, producing, catches, for, export, as, far, as, ukraine, the, improvements, to, the, fishing, industry, were, largely, due, to, the, drop, in, the, average, salinity, of, the, sea, from, 30, grams, to, 8, grams, per, liter, this, drop, in, salinity, prompted, the, return, of, almost, 24, freshwater, species, the, restoration, also, reportedly, gave, rise, to, long, absent, rain, clouds, and, possible, microclimate, changes, bringing, tentative, hope, to, an, agricultural, sector, swallowed, by, a, regional, dustbowl, and, some, expansion, of, the, shrunken, sea, the, sea, which, had, receded, almost, 100, km, 62, mi, south, of, the, port, city, of, aralsk, is, now, a, mere, 25, km, 16, mi, away, the, kazakh, foreign, ministry, stated, that, the, north, aral, sea, s, surface, increased, from, 2, 550, square, kilometers, 980, sq, mi, in, 2003, to, 3, 300, square, kilometers, 1, 300, sq, mi, in, 2008, the, sea, s, depth, increased, from, 30, meters, 98, ft, in, 2003, to, 42, meters, 138, ft, in, 2008, now, a, second, dam, is, to, be, built, based, on, a, world, bank, loan, to, kazakhstan, with, the, start, of, construction, initially, slated, for, 2009, and, postponed, to, 2011, to, further, expand, the, shrunken, northern, aral, eventually, reducing, the, distance, to, aralsk, to, only, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, then, it, was, planned, to, build, a, canal, spanning, the, last, 6, km, to, reconnect, the, withered, former, port, of, aralsk, to, the, sea, on, 15, june, 2021, the, central, communications, service, of, kazakhstan, announced, that, they, plan, to, plant, saxaul, trees, on, one, million, hectares, of, the, drained, bottom, of, the, aral, sea, as, part, of, efforts, to, stop, dust, storms, on, the, region, other, efforts, include, expanding, the, sea, s, water, mirror, the, south, aral, sea, half, of, which, lies, in, uzbekistan, was, abandoned, to, its, fate, most, of, uzbekistan, s, part, of, the, aral, sea, is, completely, shriveled, up, only, excess, water, from, the, north, aral, sea, is, periodically, allowed, to, flow, into, the, largely, dried, up, south, aral, sea, through, a, sluice, in, the, dyke, discussions, had, been, held, on, recreating, a, channel, between, the, somewhat, improved, north, and, the, desiccated, south, along, with, uncertain, wetland, restoration, plans, throughout, the, region, but, political, will, is, lacking, unlike, kazakhstan, which, has, partially, revived, its, part, of, the, aral, sea, uzbekistan, shows, no, signs, of, abandoning, the, amu, darya, river, to, irrigate, their, cotton, and, is, moving, toward, oil, exploration, in, the, drying, south, aral, seabed, attempts, to, mitigate, the, effects, of, desertification, include, planting, vegetation, in, the, newly, exposed, seabed, however, intermittent, flooding, of, the, eastern, basin, is, likely, to, prove, problematic, for, any, development, redirecting, what, little, flow, there, is, from, the, amu, darya, to, the, western, basin, may, salvage, fisheries, there, while, relieving, the, flooding, of, the, eastern, basin, the, reforestation, is, focused, on, plants, adapted, to, desert, conditions, such, as, haloxylon, ammodendron, ephedra, strobilacea, salsola, species, and, tamarix, species, the, eventual, aim, is, to, plant, up, to, 200, 000, hectares, 490, 000, acres, of, forest, in, the, uzbekistan, portion, the, forest, is, intended, to, slow, desertification, and, reduce, the, impact, of, sandstorms, on, nearby, communities, the, interstate, commission, for, water, coordination, of, central, asia, icwc, was, formed, on, 18, february, 1992, to, formally, unite, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, in, the, hopes, of, solving, environmental, as, well, as, socioeconomic, problems, in, the, aral, sea, region, the, river, basin, organizations, the, bvos, of, the, syr, darya, and, amu, darya, rivers, were, institutions, called, upon, by, the, icwc, to, help, manage, water, resources, according, to, the, icwc, the, main, objectives, of, the, body, are, the, international, fund, for, saving, the, aral, sea, ifas, was, developed, on, 23, march, 1993, by, the, icwc, to, raise, funds, for, the, projects, under, aral, sea, basin, programmes, the, ifas, was, meant, to, finance, programmes, to, save, the, sea, and, improve, on, environmental, issues, associated, with, the, basin, s, drying, this, programme, has, had, some, success, with, joint, summits, of, the, countries, involved, and, finding, funding, from, the, world, bank, to, implement, projects, however, it, faces, many, challenges, such, as, enforcement, and, slowing, progress, vozrozhdeniya, russian, for, rebirth, island, is, a, former, island, of, the, aral, sea, or, south, aral, sea, due, to, the, ongoing, shrinkage, of, the, aral, it, became, first, a, peninsula, in, mid, 2001, and, finally, part, of, the, mainland, other, islands, like, kokaral, and, barsa, kelmes, shared, a, similar, fate, since, the, disappearance, of, the, southeast, aral, in, 2008, vozrozhdeniya, island, effectively, no, longer, exists, as, a, distinct, geographical, feature, the, area, is, now, shared, by, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, in, 1948, a, top, secret, soviet, bioweapons, laboratory, was, established, on, the, island, in, the, centre, of, the, aral, sea, which, is, now, disputed, territory, between, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, the, exact, history, functions, and, current, status, of, this, facility, are, still, unclear, but, bio, agents, tested, there, included, bacillus, anthracis, coxiella, burnetii, francisella, tularensis, brucella, suis, rickettsia, prowazekii, variola, major, smallpox, yersinia, pestis, botulinum, toxin, and, venezuelan, equine, encephalitis, virus, in, 1971, weaponized, smallpox, from, the, island, reached, a, nearby, ship, which, then, allowed, the, virus, to, spread, to, the, city, of, aral, ten, people, there, were, infected, of, whom, three, died, and, a, massive, vaccination, effort, involving, 50, 000, inhabitants, ensued, see, aral, smallpox, incident, the, bioweapons, base, was, abandoned, in, 1992, following, the, disintegration, of, the, soviet, union, the, previous, year, scientific, expeditions, proved, this, had, been, a, site, for, production, testing, and, later, dumping, of, pathogenic, weapons, in, 2002, through, a, project, organized, by, the, united, states, and, with, uzbekistan, s, assistance, 10, anthrax, burial, sites, were, decontaminated, according, to, the, kazakh, scientific, center, for, quarantine, and, zoonotic, infections, all, burial, sites, of,

explore, and, develop, oil, and, gas, fields, in, the, aral, sea, saying, the, aral, sea, is, largely, unknown, but, it, holds, a, lot, of, promise, in, terms, of, finding, oil, and, gas, there, is, risk, of, course, but, we, believe, in, the, success, of, this, unique, project, the, consortium, was, created, in, september, 2005, as, of, 1, june, 2010, 500, 000, cubic, meters, of, gas, had, been,
