new, zealand, population, was, far, higher, equalling, or, even, exceeding, the, population, of, the, north, island, this, was, exacerbated, by, the, new, zealand, wars, and, the, otago, gold, rush, of, the, 1860s, since, that, time, the, south, island, s, population, as, a, percentage, of, the, country, s, total, population, has, steadily, decreased, with, the, population, of, the, south, island, now, being, less, than, that, of, the, north, island, s, largest, city, auckland, this, growing, disparity, has, stabilised, in, recent, years, with, both, the, 2013, and, 2018, censuses,
