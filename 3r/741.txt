that, comprised, part, of, the, march, of, gothia, and, the, march, of, hispania, under, the, control, of, the, count, of, barcelona, and, his, relatives, the, origin, of, the, name, catalunya, is, subject, to, diverse, interpretations, because, of, a, lack, of, evidence, one, theory, suggests, that, catalunya, derives, from, the, name, gothia, or, gauthia, launia, land, of, the, goths, since, the, origins, of, the, catalan, counts, lords, and, people, were, found, in, the, march, of, gothia, known, as, gothia, whence, gothland, gothlandia, gothalania, cathalaunia, catalonia, theoretically,

878, 897, made, his, titles, hereditaries, and, thus, founded, the, dynasty, of, the, house, of, barcelona, which, reigned, in, catalonia, until, 1410, in, 988, borrell, ii, count, of, barcelona, did, not, recognise, the, new, french, king, hugh, capet, as, his, king, evidencing, the, loss, of, dependency, from, frankish, rule, and, confirming, his, successors, from, ramon, borrell, i, onwards, as, independent, of, the, capetian, crown, whom, they, regarded, as, usurpers, of, the, carolingian, frankish, realm, at, the, beginning, of, eleventh, century, the, catalan, counties, experienced, an, important, process, of, feudalisation, however, the, efforts, of, church, s, sponsored, peace, and, truce, assemblies, and, the, intervention, of, ramon, berenguer, i, count, of, barcelona, 1035, 1076, in, the, negotiations, with, the, rebel, nobility, resulted, in, the, partial, restoration, of, the, comital, authority, under, the, new, feudal, order, to, fulfill, that, purpose, ramon, berenguer, began, the, modification, of, the, legislation, in, the, written, usages, of, barcelona, being, one, of, the, first, european, compilations, of, feudal, law, in, 1137, ramon, berenguer, iv,

union, of, the, county, of, barcelona, with, aragon, creating, a, composite, monarchy, later, known, as, the, crown, of, aragon, and, making, the, catalan, counties, that, were, vassalized, or, merged, with, the, county, of, barcelona, into, a, principality, of, the, aragonese, crown, during, the, reign, of, his, son, alphons, in, 1173, catalonia, was, regarded, as, a, legal, entity, for, the, first, time, while, the, usages, of, barcelona, were, compiled, in, the, process, to, turn, them, into, the, law, and, custom, of, catalonia, consuetudinem, cathalonie, being, considered, one, of, the, milestones, of, catalan, political, identity, in, 1258, by, means, of, the, treaty, of, corbeil, james, i, of, aragon, king, of, aragon, and, count, of, barcelona, king, of, mallorca, and,

might, have, over, the, catalan, counties, except, the, county, of, foix, despite, the, opposition, of, king, james, this, treaty, confirmed, from, french, point, of, view, the, independence, of, the, catalan, counties, established, and, exercised, during, the, previous, three, centuries, but, also, meant, the, irremediable, separation, between, the, geographical, areas, of, catalonia, and, languedoc, as, a, coastal, territory, catalonia, became, the, base, of, the, aragonese, crown, s, maritime, forces, which, spread, the, power, of, the, crown, in, the, mediterranean, turning, barcelona, into, a, powerful, and, wealthy, city, in, the, period, of, 1164, 1410, new, territories, the, kingdom, of, valencia, the, kingdom, of, majorca, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, briefly, the, duchies, of, athens, and, neopatras, were, incorporated, into, the, dynastic, domains, of, the, house, of, aragon, the, expansion, was, accompanied, by, a, great, development, of, the, catalan, trade, creating, an, extensive, trade, network, across, the, mediterranean, which, competed, with, those, of, the, maritime, republics, of, genoa, and, venice, at, the, same, time, the, principality, of, catalonia, developed, a, complex, institutional, and, political, system, based, in, the, concept, of, a, pact, between, the, estates, of, the, realm, and, the, king, the, legislation, of, catalonia, had, to, be, passed, the, catalan, courts, corts, catalanes, one, of, the, first, parliamentary, bodies, of, europe, that, since, 1283, obtained, the, power, to, legislate, with, the, monarch, the, courts, were, composed, of, the, three, estates, organized, into, arms, bra, os, were, presided, over, by, the, monarch, and, approved, the, catalan, constitutions, which, established, a, compilation, of, rights, for, the, inhabitants, of, the, principality, in, order, to, collect, general, taxes, the, catalan, courts, of, 1359, established, a, permanent, representative, body, known, as, the, deputation, of, the, general, or, generalitat, which, gained, considerable, political, power, over, the, next, centuries, the, domains, of, the, aragonese, crown, were, severely, affected, by, the, black, death, pandemic, and, by, later, outbreaks, of, the, plague, between, 1347, and, 1497, catalonia, lost, 37, percent, of, its, population, in, 1410, the, last, reigning, monarch, of, the, house, of, barcelona, king, martin, i, died, without, surviving, descendants, under, the, compromise, of, caspe, 1412, the, representatives, of, the, kingdoms, of, aragon, valencia, and, the, principality, of, catalonia, appointed, ferdinand, from, the, castilian, house, of, trast, mara, as, king, of, the, crown, of, aragon, during, the, reign, of, his, son, john, ii, the, persistent, economic, crisis, and, social, and, political, tensions, in, the, principality, led, to, the, catalan, civil, war, 1462, 1472, and, the, war, of, the, remences, 1462, 1486, that, left, catalonia, exhausted, the, sentencia, arbitral, de, guadalupe, 1486, liberated, the, remen, a, peasants, from, the, feudal, evil, customs, in, the, later, middle, ages, catalan, literature, flourished, in, catalonia, proper, and, in, the, kingdoms, of, majorca, and, valencia, with, such, remarkable, authors, as, the, philosopher, ramon, llull, the, valencian, poet, ausi, s, march, and, joanot, martorell, author, of, the, novel, tirant, lo, blanch, published, in, 1490, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, the, grandson, of, ferdinand, i, and, queen, isabella, i, of, castile, were, married, in, 1469, later, taking, the, title, the, catholic, monarchs, subsequently, this, event, was, seen, by, historiographers, as, the, dawn, of, a, unified, spain, at, this, time, though, united, by, marriage, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, maintained, distinct, territories, each, keeping, its, own, traditional, institutions, parliaments, laws, and, currency, castile, commissioned, expeditions, to, the, americas, and, benefited, from, the, riches, acquired, in, the, spanish, colonisation, of, the, americas, but, in, time, also, carried, the, main, burden, of, military, expenses, of, the, united, spanish, kingdoms, after, isabella, s, death, ferdinand, ii, personally, ruled, both, crowns, by, virtue, of, descent, from, his, maternal, grandparents, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castile, in, 1516, charles, i, of, spain, became, the, first, king, to, rule, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, simultaneously, by, his, own, right, following, the, death, of, his, paternal, house, of, habsburg, grandfather, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, he, was, also, elected, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1519, over, the, next, few, centuries, the, principality, of, catalonia, was, generally, on, the, losing, side, of, a, series, of, wars, that, led, steadily, to, an, increased, centralization, of, power, in, spain, despite, this, fact, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, the, participation, of, the, political, community, in, the, local, and, the, general, catalan, government, grew, thus, consolidating, its, constitutional, system, while, the, kings, remained, absent, represented, by, a, viceroy, tensions, between, catalan, institutions, and, the, monarchy, began, to, arise, the, large, and, burdensome, presence, of, the, spanish, royal, army, in, the, principality, due, to, the, franco, spanish, war, led, to, an, uprising, of, peasants, provoking, the, reapers, war, 1640, 1652, which, saw, catalonia, rebel, briefly, as, a, republic, led, by, the, president, of, the, generalitat, pau, claris, with, french, help, against, the, spanish, crown, for, overstepping, catalonia, s, rights, during, the, thirty, years, war, within, a, brief, period, france, took, full, control, of, catalonia, most, of, catalonia, was, reconquered, by, the, spanish, monarchy, but, catalan, rights, were, mostly, recognised, roussillon, and, half, of, cerdanya, was, lost, to, france, by, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, 1659, the, most, significant, conflict, concerning, the, governing, monarchy, was, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1701, 1715, which, began, when, the, childless, charles, ii, of, spain, the, last, spanish, habsburg, died, without, an, heir, in, 1700, charles, ii, had, chosen, philip, v, of, spain, from, the, french, house, of, bourbon, catalonia, like, other, territories, that, formed, the, crown, of, aragon, rose, up, in, support, of, the, austrian, habsburg, pretender, charles, vi, holy, roman, emperor, in, his, claim, for, the, spanish, throne, as, charles, iii, of, spain, the, fight, between, the, houses, of, bourbon, and, habsburg, for, the, spanish, crown, split, spain, and, europe, the, fall, of, barcelona, on, 11, september, 1714, to, the, bourbon, king, philip, v, militarily, ended, the, habsburg, claim, to, the, spanish, crown, which, became, legal, fact, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, philip, felt, that, he, had, been, betrayed, by, the, catalan, courts, as, it, had, initially, sworn, its, loyalty, to, him, when, he, had, presided, over, it, in, 1701, in, retaliation, for, the, betrayal, and, inspired, by, the, french, model, the, first, bourbon, king, enacted, the, nueva, planta, decrees, of, 1707, 1715, and, 1716, incorporating, the, realms, of, the, crown, of, aragon, including, the, principality, of, catalonia, in, 1716, as, provinces, of, the, crown, of, castile, terminating, their, status, as, separate, states, along, with, their, parliaments, institutions, and, public, and, administrative, laws, as, well, as, their, pactist, politics, within, a, french, style, centralized, and, absolutist, kingdom, of, spain, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, and, the, 18th, century, excluding, the, parentesis, of, the, succession, war, and, the, post, war, inestability, catalonia, carried, out, a, successful, process, of, economic, growth, and, proto, industrialization, reinforced, in, the, late, quarter, of, the, century, when, castile, s, trade, monopoly, with, american, colonies, ended, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, assimilation, of, the, crown, of, aragon, by, the, castilian, crown, through, the, nueva, planta, decrees, was, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, the, spanish, nation, state, these, nationalist, policies, sometimes, very, aggressive, and, still, in, force, have, been, and, are, the, seed, of, repeated, territorial, conflicts, within, the, state, at, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, catalonia, was, severely, affected, by, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1808, it, was, occupied, by, french, troops, under, general, guillaume, philibert, duhesme, after, he, conquered, barcelona, the, resistance, against, the, occupation, eventually, developed, into, the, peninsular, war, the, rejection, of, french, dominion, was, institutionalized, with, the, creation, of, juntas, councils, who, remaining, loyal, to, the, bourbons, exercised, the, sovereignty, and, representation, of, the, territory, due, to, the, disappearance, of, the, old, institutions, napoleon, took, direct, control, of, catalonia, to, reestablish, order, creating, the, government, of, catalonia, under, the, rule, of, marshall, augereau, and, making, catalan, briefly, an, official, language, again, between, 1812, and, 1814, catalonia, was, annexed, to, france, and, organized, as, four, departments, the, french, troops, evacuated, catalan, territory, at, the, end, of, 1814, after, the, bourbon, restoration, in, spain, and, the, death, of, the, absolutist, king, ferdinand, vii, 1833, carlist, wars, erupted, against, the, newly, established, liberal, state, of, isabella, ii,

the, catalan, hydrographic, network, consists, of, two, important, basins, the, one, of, the, ebro, and, the, one, that, comprises, the, internal, basins, of, catalonia, respectively, covering, 46, 84, and, 51, 43, of, the, territory, all, of, them, flow, to, the, mediterranean, furthermore, there, is, the, garona, river, basin, that, flows, to, the, atlantic, ocean, but, it, only, covers, 1, 73, of, the, catalan, territory, the, hydrographic, network, can, be, divided, in, two, sectors, an, occidental, slope, or, ebro, river, slope, and, one, oriental, slope, constituted, by, minor, rivers, that, flow, to, the, mediterranean, along, the, catalan, coast, the, first, slope, provides, an, average, of, 18, 700, cubic, hectometres, 4, 5, cubic, miles, per, year, while, the, second, only, provides, an, average, of, 2, 020, hm, 3, 0, 48, cu, mi, year, the, difference, is, due, to, the, big, contribution, of, the, ebro, river, from, which, the, segre, is, an, important, tributary, moreover, in, catalonia, there, is, a, relative, wealth, of, groundwaters, although, there, is, inequality, between, comarques, given, the, complex, geological, structure, of, the, territory, in, the, pyrenees, there, are, many, small, lakes, remnants, of, the, ice, age, the, biggest, are, the, lake, of, banyoles, and, the, recently, recovered, lake, of, ivars, the, catalan, coast, is, almost, rectilinear, with, a, length, of, 580, kilometres, 360, mi, and, few, landforms, the, most, relevant, are, the, cap, de, creus, and, the, gulf, of, roses, to, the, north, and, the, ebro, delta, to,

of, catalan, population, is, concentrated, in, 30, of, the, territory, mainly, in, the, coastal, plains, intensive, agriculture, livestock, farming, and, industrial, activities, have, been, accompanied, by, a, massive, tourist, influx, more, than, 20, million, annual, visitors, a, rate, of, urbanization, and, even, of, major, metropolisation, which, has, led, to, a, strong, urban, sprawl, two, thirds, of, catalans, live, in, the, urban, area, of, barcelona, while, the, proportion, of, urban, land, increased, from, 4, 2, in, 1993, to, 6, 2, in, 2009, a, growth, of, 48, 6, in, sixteen, years, complemented, with, a, dense, network, of, transport, infrastructure, this, is, accompanied, by, a, certain, agricultural, abandonment, decrease, of, 15, of, all, areas, cultivated, in, catalonia, between, 1993, and, 2009, and, a, global, threat, to, natural, environment, human, activities, have, also, put, some, animal, species, at, risk, or, even, led, to, their, disappearance, from, the, territory, like, the, gray, wolf, and, probably, the, brown, bear, of, the, pyrenees, the, pressure, created, by, this, model, of, life, means, that, the, country, s, ecological, footprint, exceeds, its, administrative, area, faced, with, these, problems, catalan, authorities, initiated, several, measures, whose, purpose, is, to, protect, natural, ecosystems, thus, in, 1990, the, catalan, government, created, the, nature, conservation, council, catalan, consell, de, protecci, de, la, natura, an, advisory, body, with, the, aim, to, study, protect, and, manage, the, natural, environments, and, landscapes, of, catalonia, in, addition, the, generalitat, has, carried, out, the, plan, of, spaces, of, natural, interest, pla, d, espais, d, inter, s, natural, or, pein, in, 1992,

spanish, republic, at, the, end, of, the, spanish, civil, war, in, 1939, this, autonomous, community, has, gradually, achieved, more, autonomy, since, the, approval, of, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1978, the, generalitat, holds, exclusive, jurisdiction, in, education, health, culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public, safety, and, local, government, and, only, shares, jurisdiction, with, the, spanish, government, in, justice, in, all, some, analysts, argue, that, formally, the, current, system, grants, catalonia, with, more, self, government, than, almost, any, other, corner, in, europe, the, support, for, catalan, nationalism, ranges, from, a, demand, for, further, autonomy, and, the, federalisation, of, spain, to, the, desire, for, independence, from, the, rest, of, spain, expressed, by, catalan, independentists, the, first, survey, following, the, constitutional, court, ruling, that, cut, back, elements, of, the, 2006, statute, of, autonomy, published, by, la, vanguardia, on, 18, july, 2010, found, that, 46, of, the, voters, would, support, independence, in, a, referendum, in, february, of, the, same, year, a, poll, by, the, open, university, of, catalonia, gave, more, or, less, the, same, results, other, polls, have, shown, lower, support, for, independence, ranging, from, 40, to, 49, although, it, is, established, in, the, whole, of, the, territory, support, for, independence, is, significantly, higher, in, the, hinterland, and, the, northeast, away, from, the, more, populous, coastal, areas, such, as, barcelona, since, 2011, when, the, question, started, to, be, regularly, surveyed, by, the, governmental, center, for, public, opinion, studies, ceo, support, for, catalan, independence, has, been, on, the, rise, according, to, the, ceo, opinion, poll, from, july, 2016, 47, 7, of, catalans, would, vote, for, independence, and, 42, 4, against, it, while, about, the, question, of, preferences, according, to, the, ceo, opinion, poll, from, march, 2016, a, 57, 2, claim, to, be, absolutely, or, fairly, in, favour, of, independence, other, polls, have, shown, lower, support, for, independence, ranging, from,

92, mainly, use, spanish, and, 35, 54, mainly, use, catalan, there, is, a, significant, difference, between, the, barcelona, metropolitan, area, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, tarragona, area, where, spanish, is, more, spoken, than, catalan, and, the, more, rural, and, small, town, areas, where, catalan, clearly, prevails, over, spanish, originating, in, the, historic, territory, of, catalonia, catalan, has, enjoyed, special, status, since, the, approval, of, the, statute, of, autonomy, of, 1979, which, declares, it, to, be, catalonia, s, own, language, a, term, which, signifies, a, language, given, special, legal, status, within, a, spanish, territory, or, which, is, historically, spoken, within, a, given, region, the, other, languages, with, official, status, in, catalonia, are, spanish, which, has, official, status, throughout, spain, and, aranese, occitan, which, is, spoken, in, val, d, aran, since, the, statute, of, autonomy, of, 1979, aranese, a, gascon, dialect, of, occitan, has, also, been, official, and, subject, to, special, protection, in, val, d, aran, this, small, area, of, 7, 000, inhabitants, was, the, only, place, where, a, dialect, of, occitan, had, received, full, official, status, then, on, 9, august, 2006, when, the, new, statute, came, into, force, occitan, became, official, throughout, catalonia, occitan, is, the, mother, tongue, of, 22, 4, of, the, population, of, val, d, aran, which, has, attracted, heavy, immigration, from, other, spanish, regions, to, work, in, the, service, industry, catalan, sign, language, is, also, officially, recognised, although, not, considered, an, official, language, in, the, same, way, as, catalan, spanish, and, occitan, the, catalan, sign, language, with, about, 18, 000, users, in, catalonia, is, granted, official, recognition, and, support, the, public, authorities, shall, guarantee, the, use, of, catalan, sign, language, and, conditions, of, equality, for, deaf, people, who, choose, to, use, this, language, which, shall, be, the, subject, of, education, protection, and, respect, as, was, the, case, since, the, ascent, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, to, the, throne, of, spain, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, with, the, exception, of, the, short, period, of, the, second, spanish, republic, under, francoist, spain, catalan, was, banned, from, schools, and, all, other, official, use, so, that, for, example, families, were, not, allowed, to, officially, register, children, with, catalan, names, although, never, completely, banned, catalan, language, publishing, was, severely, restricted, during, the, early, 1940s, with, only, religious, texts, and, small, run, self, published, texts, being, released, some, books, were, published, clandestinely, or, circumvented, the, restrictions, by, showing, publishing, dates, prior, to, 1936, this, policy, was, changed, in, 1946, when, restricted, publishing, in, catalan, resumed, rural, urban, migration, originating, in, other, parts, of, spain, also, reduced, the, social, use, of, catalan, in, urban, areas, and, increased, the, use, of, spanish, lately, a, similar, sociolinguistic, phenomenon, has, occurred, with, foreign, immigration, catalan, cultural, activity, increased, in, the, 1960s, and, the, teaching, of, catalan, began, thanks, to, the, initiative, of, associations, such, as, mnium, cultural, after, the, end, of, francoist, spain, the, newly, established, self, governing, democratic, institutions, in, catalonia, embarked, on, a, long, term, language, policy, to, recover, the, use, of, catalan, and, has, since, 1983, enforced, laws, which, attempt, to, protect, and, extend, the, use, of, catalan, this, policy, known, as, the, linguistic, normalisation, normalitzaci, ling, stica, in, catalan, normalizaci, n, ling, stica, in, spanish, has, been, supported, by, the, vast, majority, of, catalan, political, parties, through, the, last, thirty, years, some, groups, consider, these, efforts, a, way, to, discourage, the, use, of, spanish, whereas, some, others, including, the, catalan, government, and, the, european, union, consider, the, policies, respectful, or, even, as, an, example, which, should, be, disseminated, throughout, the, union, today, catalan, is, the, main, language, of, the, catalan, autonomous, government, and, the, other, public, institutions, that, fall, under, its, jurisdiction, basic, public, education, is, given, mainly, in, catalan, but, also, there, are, some, hours, per, week, of, spanish, medium, instruction, although, businesses, are, required, by, law, to, display, all, information, e, g, menus, posters, at, least, in, catalan, this, not, systematically, enforced, there, is, no, obligation, to, display, this, information, in, either, occitan, or, spanish, although, there, is, no, restriction, on, doing, so, in, these, or, other, languages, the, use, of, fines, was, introduced, in, a, 1997, linguistic, law, that, aims, to, increase, the, public, use, of, catalan, and, defend, the, rights, of, catalan, speakers, on, the, other, hand, the, spanish, constitution, does, not, recognize, equal, language, rights, for, national, minorities, since, it, enshrined, spanish, as, the, only, official, language, of, the, state, the, knowledge, of, which, being, compulsory, numerous, laws, regarding, for, instance, the, labelling, of, pharmaceutical, products, make, in, effect, spanish, the, only, language, of, compulsory, use, the, law, ensures, that, both, catalan, and, spanish, being, official, languages, can, be, used, by, the, citizens, without, prejudice, in, all, public, and, private, activities, the, generalitat, uses, catalan, in, its, communications, and, notifications, addressed, to, the, general, population, but, citizens, can, also, receive, information, from, the, generalitat, in, spanish, if, they, so, wish, debates, in, the, catalan, parliament, take, place, almost, exclusively, in, catalan, and, the, catalan, public, television, broadcasts, programs, mainly, in, catalan, due, to, the, intense, immigration, which, spain, in, general, and, catalonia, in, particular, experienced, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, many, foreign, languages, are, spoken, in, various, cultural, communities, in, catalonia, of, which, rif, berber, moroccan, arabic, romanian, and, urdu, are, the, most, common, ones, in, catalonia, there, is, a, high, social, and, political, consensus, on, the, language, policies, favoring, catalan, also, among, spanish, speakers, and, speakers, of, other, languages, however, some, of, these, policies, have, been, criticised, for, trying, to, promote, catalan, by, imposing, fines, on, businesses, for, example, following, the, passage, of, the, law, on, catalan, cinema, in, march, 2010, which, established, that, half, of, the, movies, shown, in, catalan, cinemas, had, to, be, in, catalan, a, general, strike, of, 75, of, the, cinemas, took, place, the, catalan, government, gave, in, and, dropped, the, clause, that, forced, 50, of, the, movies, to, be, dubbed, or, subtitled, in, catalan, before, the, law, came, to, effect, on, the, other, hand, organisations, such, as, plataforma, per, la, llengua, reported, different, violations, of, the, linguistic, rights, of, the, catalan, speakers, in, catalonia, and, the, other, catalan, speaking, territories, in, spain, most, of, them, caused, by, the, institutions, of, the, spanish, government, in, these, territories, the, catalan, language, policy, has, been, challenged, by, some, political, parties, in, the, catalan, parliament, citizens, currently, the, main, opposition, party, has, been, one, of, the, most, consistent, critics, of, the, catalan, language, policy, within, catalonia, the, catalan, branch, of, the, people, s, party, has, a, more, ambiguous, position, on, the, issue, on, one, hand, it, demands, a, bilingual, catalan, spanish, education, and, a, more, balanced, language, policy, that, would, defend, catalan, without, favoring, it, over, spanish, whereas, on, the, other, hand, a, few, local, pp, politicians, have, supported, in, their, municipalities, measures, privileging, catalan, over, spanish, and, it, has, defended, some, aspects, of, the, official, language, policies, sometimes, against, the, positions, of, its, colleagues, from, other, parts, of, spain, catalonia, has, given, to, the, world, many, important, figures, in, the, area, of, the, art, catalan, painters, internationally, known, are, among, others, salvador, dal, joan, mir,
