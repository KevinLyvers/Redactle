the, atlantic, ocean, is, the, second, largest, of, the, world, s, five, oceanic, divisions, with, an, area, of, about, 85, 133, 000, km, 2, 32, 870, 000, sq, mi, it, covers, approximately, 17, of, earth, s, surface, and, about, 24, of, its, water, surface, area, during, the, age, of, discovery, it, was, known, for, separating, the, new, world, of, the, americas, north, america, and, south, america, from, the, old, world, of, afro, eurasia, africa, asia, and, europe, through, its, separation, of, afro, eurasia, from, the, americas, the, atlantic, ocean, has, played, a, central, role, in, the, development, of, human, society, globalization, and, the, histories, of, many, nations, while, the, norse, were, the, first, known, humans, to, cross, the, atlantic, it, was, the, expedition, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, that, proved, to, be, the, most, consequential, columbus, expedition, ushered, in, an, age, of, exploration, and, colonization, of, the, americas, by, european, powers, most, notably, portugal, spain, france, and, the, united, kingdom, from, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, the, atlantic, ocean, was, the, center, of, both, an, eponymous, slave, trade, and, the, columbian, exchange, while, occasionally, hosting, naval, battles, such, naval, battles, as, well, as, growing, trade, from, regional, american, powers, like, the, united, states, and, brazil, both, increased, in, degree, during, the, early, 20th, century, and, while, no, major, military, conflicts, took, place, in, the, atlantic, in, the, present, day, the, ocean, remains, a, core, component, of, trade, around, the, world, the, atlantic, ocean, occupies, an, elongated, s, shaped, basin, extending, longitudinally, between, europe, and, africa, to, the, east, and, the, americas, to, the, west, as, one, component, of, the, interconnected, world, ocean, it, is, connected, in, the, north, to, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, southwest, the, indian, ocean, in, the, southeast, and, the, southern, ocean, in, the, south, other, definitions, describe, the, atlantic, as, extending, southward, to, antarctica, the, atlantic, ocean, is, divided, in, two, parts, the, northern, and, southern, atlantic, by, the, equator, the, oldest, known, mentions, of, an, atlantic, sea, come, from, stesichorus, around, mid, sixth, century, bc, sch, a, r, 1, 211, atlantik, i, pel, gei, ancient, greek, the, atlantic, sea, etym, sea, of, atlas, and, in, the, histories, of, herodotus, around, 450, bc, hdt, 1, 202, 4, atlantis, thalassa, ancient, greek, sea, of, atlas, or, the, atlantic, sea, where, the, name, refers, to, the, sea, beyond, the, pillars, of, heracles, which, is, said, to, be, part, of, the, sea, that, surrounds, all, land, in, these, uses, the, name, refers, to, atlas, the, titan, in, greek, mythology, who, supported, the, heavens, and, who, later, appeared, as, a, frontispiece, in, medieval, maps, and, also, lent, his, name, to, modern, atlases, on, the, other, hand, to, early, greek, sailors, and, in, ancient, greek, mythological, literature, such, as, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, this, all, encompassing, ocean, was, instead, known, as, oceanus, the, gigantic, river, that, encircled, the, world, in, contrast, to, the, enclosed, seas, well, known, to, the, greeks, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, in, contrast, the, term, atlantic, originally, referred, specifically, to, the, atlas, mountains, in, morocco, and, the, sea, off, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, the, west, african, coast, the, term, aethiopian, ocean, derived, from, ancient, ethiopia, was, applied, to, the, southern, atlantic, as, late, as, the, mid, 19th, century, during, the, age, of, discovery, the, atlantic, was, also, known, to, english, cartographers, as, the, great, western, ocean, the, pond, is, a, term, often, used, by, british, and, american, speakers, in, reference, to, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, as, a, form, of, meiosis, or, ironic, understatement, it, is, used, mostly, when, referring, to, events, or, circumstances, on, this, side, of, the, pond, or, on, the, other, side, of, the, pond, or, across, the, pond, rather, than, to, discuss, the, ocean, itself, the, term, dates, to, 1640, first, appearing, in, print, in, pamphlet, released, during, the, reign, of, charles, i, and, reproduced, in, 1869, in, nehemiah, wallington, s, historical, notices, of, events, occurring, chiefly, in, the, reign, of, charles, i, where, great, pond, is, used, in, reference, to, the, atlantic, ocean, by, francis, windebank, charles, i, s, secretary, of, state, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, defined, the, limits, of, the, oceans, and, seas, in, 1953, but, some, of, these, definitions, have, been, revised, since, then, and, some, are, not, recognized, by, various, authorities, institutions, and, countries, for, example, the, cia, world, factbook, correspondingly, the, extent, and, number, of, oceans, and, seas, vary, the, atlantic, ocean, is, bounded, on, the, west, by, north, and, south, america, it, connects, to, the, arctic, ocean, through, the, denmark, strait, greenland, sea, norwegian, sea, and, barents, sea, to, the, east, the, boundaries, of, the, ocean, proper, are, europe, the, strait, of, gibraltar, where, it, connects, with, the, mediterranean, sea, one, of, its, marginal, seas, and, in, turn, the, black, sea, both, of, which, also, touch, upon, asia, and, africa, in, the, southeast, the, atlantic, merges, into, the, indian, ocean, the, 20, east, meridian, running, south, from, cape, agulhas, to, antarctica, defines, its, border, in, the, 1953, definition, it, extends, south, to, antarctica, while, in, later, maps, it, is, bounded, at, the, 60, parallel, by, the, southern, ocean, the, atlantic, has, irregular, coasts, indented, by, numerous, bays, gulfs, and, seas, these, include, the, baltic, sea, black, sea, caribbean, sea, davis, strait, denmark, strait, part, of, the, drake, passage, gulf, of, mexico, labrador, sea, mediterranean, sea, north, sea, norwegian, sea, almost, all, of, the, scotia, sea, and, other, tributary, water, bodies, including, these, marginal, seas, the, coast, line, of, the, atlantic, measures, 111, 866, km, 69, 510, mi, compared, to, 135, 663, km, 84, 297, mi, for, the, pacific, including, its, marginal, seas, the, atlantic, covers, an, area, of, 106, 460, 000, km, 2, 41, 100, 000, sq, mi, or, 23, 5, of, the, global, ocean, and, has, a, volume, of, 310, 410, 900, km, 3, 74, 471, 500, cu, mi,

dominated, by, a, submarine, mountain, range, called, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, mar, it, runs, from, 87, n, or, 300, km, 190, mi, south, of, the, north, pole, to, the, subantarctic, bouvet, island, at, 54, s, expeditions, to, explore, the, bathymertry, of, the, atlantic, include, the, challenger, expedition, and, the, german, meteor, expedition, as, of, 2001, columbia, university, s, lamont, doherty, earth, observatory, and, the, united, states, navy, hydrographic, office, conduct, research, on, the, ocean, the, mar, divides, the, atlantic, longitudinally, into, two, halves, in, each, of, which, a, series, of, basins, are, delimited, by, secondary, transverse, ridges, the, mar, reaches, above, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, along, most, of, its, length, but, is, interrupted, by, larger, transform, faults, at, two, places, the, romanche, trench, near, the, equator, and, the, gibbs, fracture, zone, at, 53, n, the, mar, is, a, barrier, for, bottom, water, but, at, these, two, transform, faults, deep, water, currents, can, pass, from, one, side, to, the, other, the, mar, rises, 2, 3, km, 1, 2, 1, 9, mi, above, the, surrounding, ocean, floor, and, its, rift, valley, is, the, divergent, boundary, between, the, north, american, and, eurasian, plates, in, the, north, atlantic, and, the, south, american, and, african, plates, in, the, south, atlantic, the, mar, produces, basaltic, volcanoes, in, eyjafjallaj, kull, iceland, and, pillow, lava, on, the, ocean, floor, the, depth, of, water, at, the, apex, of, the, ridge, is, less, than, 2, 700, m, 1, 500, fathoms, 8, 900, ft, in, most, places, while, the, bottom, of, the, ridge, is, three, times, as, deep, the, mar, is, intersected, by, two, perpendicular, ridges, the, azores, gibraltar, transform, fault, the, boundary, between, the, nubian, and, eurasian, plates, intersects, the, mar, at, the, azores, triple, junction, on, either, side, of, the, azores, microplate, near, the, 40, n, a, much, vaguer, nameless, boundary, between, the, north, american, and, south, american, plates, intersects, the, mar, near, or, just, north, of, the, fifteen, twenty, fracture, zone, approximately, at, 16, n, in, the, 1870s, the, challenger, expedition, discovered, parts, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, or, an, elevated, ridge, rising, to, an, average, height, of, about, 1, 900, fathoms, below, the, surface, traverses, the, basins, of, the, north, and, south, atlantic, in, a, meridianal, direction, from, cape, farewell, probably, its, far, south, at, least, as, gough, island, following, roughly, the, outlines, of, the, coasts, of, the, old, and, the, new, worlds, the, remainder, of, the, ridge, was, discovered, in, the, 1920s, by, the, german, meteor, expedition, using, echo, sounding, equipment, the, exploration, of, the, mar, in, the, 1950s, led, to, the, general, acceptance, of, seafloor, spreading, and, plate, tectonics, most, of, the, mar, runs, under, water, but, where, it, reaches, the, surfaces, it, has, produced, volcanic, islands, while, nine, of, these, have, collectively, been, nominated, a, world, heritage, site, for, their, geological, value, four, of, them, are, considered, of, outstanding, universal, value, based, on, their, cultural, and, natural, criteria, ingvellir, iceland, landscape, of, the, pico, island, vineyard, culture, portugal, gough, and, inaccessible, islands, united, kingdom, and, brazilian, atlantic, islands, fernando, de, noronha, and, atol, das, rocas, reserves, brazil, continental, shelves, in, the, atlantic, are, wide, off, newfoundland, southernmost, south, america, and, northeastern, europe, in, the, western, atlantic, carbonate, platforms, dominate, large, areas, for, example, the, blake, plateau, and, bermuda, rise, the, atlantic, is, surrounded, by, passive, margins, except, at, a, few, locations, where, active, margins, form, deep, trenches, the, puerto, rico, trench, 8, 376, m, or, 27, 480, ft, maximum, depth, in, the, western, atlantic, and, south, sandwich, trench, 8, 264, m, or, 27, 113, ft, in, the, south, atlantic, there, are, numerous, submarine, canyons, off, northeastern, north, america, western, europe, and, northwestern, africa, some, of, these, canyons, extend, along, the, continental, rises, and, farther, into, the, abyssal, plains, as, deep, sea, channels, in, 1922, a, historic, moment, in, cartography, and, oceanography, occurred, the, uss, stewart, used, a, navy, sonic, depth, finder, to, draw, a, continuous, map, across, the, bed, of, the, atlantic, this, involved, little, guesswork, because, the, idea, of, sonar, is, straightforward, with, pulses, being, sent, from, the, vessel, which, bounce, off, the, ocean, floor, then, return, to, the, vessel, the, deep, ocean, floor, is, thought, to, be, fairly, flat, with, occasional, deeps, abyssal, plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and, some, guyots, various, shelves, along, the, margins, of, the, continents, constitute, about, 11, of, the, bottom, topography, with, few, deep, channels, cut, across, the, continental, rise, the, mean, depth, between, 60, n, and, 60, s, is, 3, 730, m, 12, 240, ft, or, close, to, the, average, for, the, global, ocean, with, a, modal, depth, between, 4, 000, and, 5, 000, m, 13, 000, and, 16, 000, ft, in, the, south, atlantic, the, walvis, ridge, and, rio, grande, rise, form, barriers, to, ocean, currents, the, laurentian, abyss, is, found, off, the, eastern, coast, of, canada, surface, water, temperatures, which, vary, with, latitude, current, systems, and, season, and, reflect, the, latitudinal, distribution, of, solar, energy, range, from, below, 2, c, 28, f, to, over, 30, c, 86, f, maximum, temperatures, occur, north, of, the, equator, and,

the, surface, is, usually, covered, with, sea, ice, in, the, labrador, sea, denmark, strait, and, baltic, sea, the, coriolis, effect, circulates, north, atlantic, water, in, a, clockwise, direction, whereas, south, atlantic, water, circulates, counter, clockwise, the, south, tides, in, the, atlantic, ocean, are, semi, diurnal, that, is, two, high, tides, occur, every, 24, lunar, hours, in, latitudes, above, 40, north, some, east, west, oscillation, known, as, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, occurs, on, average, the, atlantic, is, the, saltiest, major, ocean, surface, water, salinity, in, the, open, ocean, ranges, from, 33, to, 37, parts, per, thousand, 3, 3, 3, 7, by, mass, and, varies, with, latitude, and, season, evaporation, precipitation, river, inflow, and, sea, ice, melting, influence, surface, salinity, values, although, the, lowest, salinity, values, are, just, north, of, the, equator, because, of, heavy, tropical, rainfall, in, general, the, lowest, values, are, in, the, high, latitudes, and, along, coasts, where, large, rivers, enter, maximum, salinity, values, occur, at, about, 25, north, and, south, in, subtropical, regions, with, low, rainfall, and, high, evaporation, the, high, surface, salinity, in, the, atlantic, on, which, the, atlantic, thermohaline, circulation, is, dependent, is, maintained, by, two, processes, the, agulhas, leakage, rings, which, brings, salty, indian, ocean, waters, into, the, south, atlantic, and, the, atmospheric, bridge, which, evaporates, subtropical, atlantic, waters, and, exports, it, to, the, pacific, the, atlantic, ocean, consists, of, four, major, upper, water, masses, with, distinct, temperature, and, salinity, the, atlantic, subarctic, upper, water, in, the, northernmost, north, atlantic, is, the, source, for, subarctic, intermediate, water, and, north, atlantic, intermediate, water, north, atlantic, central, water, can, be, divided, into, the, eastern, and, western, north, atlantic, central, water, since, the, western, part, is, strongly, affected, by, the, gulf, stream, and, therefore, the, upper, layer, is, closer, to, underlying, fresher, subpolar, intermediate, water, the, eastern, water, is, saltier, because, of, its, proximity, to, mediterranean, water, north, atlantic, central, water, flows, into, south, atlantic, central, water, at, 15, n, there, are, five, intermediate, waters, four, low, salinity, waters, formed, at, subpolar, latitudes, and, one, high, salinity, formed, through, evaporation, arctic, intermediate, water, flows, from, the, north, to, become, the, source, for, north, atlantic, deep, water, south, of, the, greenland, scotland, sill, these, two, intermediate, waters, have, different, salinity, in, the, western, and, eastern, basins, the, wide, range, of, salinities, in, the, north, atlantic, is, caused, by, the, asymmetry, of, the, northern, subtropical, gyre, and, the, large, number, of, contributions, from, a, wide, range, of, sources, labrador, sea, norwegian, greenland, sea, mediterranean, and, south, atlantic, intermediate, water, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, nadw, is, a, complex, of, four, water, masses, two, that, form, by, deep, convection, in, the, open, ocean, classical, and, upper, labrador, sea, water, and, two, that, form, from, the, inflow, of, dense, water, across, the, greenland, iceland, scotland, sill, denmark, strait, and, iceland, scotland, overflow, water, along, its, path, across, earth, the, composition, of, the, nadw, is, affected, by, other, water, masses, especially, antarctic, bottom, water, and, mediterranean, overflow, water, the, nadw, is, fed, by, a, flow, of, warm, shallow, water, into, the, northern, north, atlantic, which, is, responsible, for, the, anomalous, warm, climate, in, europe, changes, in, the, formation, of, nadw, have, been, linked, to, global, climate, changes, in, the, past, since, human, made, substances, were, introduced, into, the, environment, the, path, of, the, nadw, can, be, traced, throughout, its, course, by, measuring, tritium, and, radiocarbon, from, nuclear, weapon, tests, in, the, 1960s, and, cfcs, the, clockwise, warm, water, north, atlantic, gyre, occupies, the, northern, atlantic, and, the, counter, clockwise, warm, water, south, atlantic, gyre, appears, in, the, southern, atlantic, in, the, north, atlantic, surface, circulation, is, dominated, by, three, inter, connected, currents, the, gulf, stream, which, flows, north, east, from, the, north, american, coast, at, cape, hatteras, the, north, atlantic, current, a, branch, of, the, gulf, stream, which, flows, northward, from, the, grand, banks, and, the, subpolar, front, an, extension, of, the, north, atlantic, current, a, wide, vaguely, defined, region, separating, the, subtropical, gyre, from, the, subpolar, gyre, this, system, of, currents, transport, warm, water, into, the, north, atlantic, without, which, temperatures, in, the, north, atlantic, and, europe, would, plunge, dramatically, north, of, the, north, atlantic, gyre, the, cyclonic, north, atlantic, subpolar, gyre, plays, a, key, role, in, climate, variability, it, is, governed, by, ocean, currents, from, marginal, seas, and, regional, topography, rather, than, being, steered, by, wind, both, in, the, deep, ocean, and, at, sea, level, the, subpolar, gyre, forms, an, important, part, of, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, its, eastern, portion, includes, eddying, branches, of, the, north, atlantic, current, which, transport, warm, saline, waters, from, the, subtropics, to, the, northeastern, atlantic, there, this, water, is, cooled, during, winter, and, forms, return, currents, that, merge, along, the, eastern, continental, slope, of, greenland, where, they, form, an, intense, 40, 50, sv, current, which, flows, around, the, continental, margins, of, the, labrador, sea, a, third, of, this, water, becomes, part, of, the, deep, portion, of, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, nadw, the, nadw, in, its, turn, feeds, the, meridional, overturning, circulation, moc, the, northward, heat, transport, of, which, is, threatened, by, anthropogenic, climate, change, large, variations, in, the, subpolar, gyre, on, a, decade, century, scale, associated, with, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, are, especially, pronounced, in, labrador, sea, water, the, upper, layers, of, the, moc, the, south, atlantic, is, dominated, by, the, anti, cyclonic, southern, subtropical, gyre, the, south, atlantic, central, water, originates, in, this, gyre, while, antarctic, intermediate, water, originates, in, the, upper, layers, of, the, circumpolar, region, near, the, drake, passage, and, the, falkland, islands, both, these, currents, receive, some, contribution, from, the, indian, ocean, on, the, african, east, coast, the, small, cyclonic, angola, gyre, lies, embedded, in, the, large, subtropical, gyre, the, southern, subtropical, gyre, is, partly, masked, by, a, wind, induced, ekman, layer, the, residence, time, of, the, gyre, is, 4, 4, 8, 5, years, north, atlantic, deep, water, flows, southward, below, the, thermocline, of, the, subtropical, gyre, the, sargasso, sea, in, the, western, north, atlantic, can, be, defined, as, the, area, where, two, species, of, sargassum, s, fluitans, and, natans, float, an, area, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, wide, and, encircled, by, the, gulf, stream, north, atlantic, drift, and, north, equatorial, current, this, population, of, seaweed, probably, originated, from, tertiary, ancestors, on, the, european, shores, of, the, former, tethys, ocean, and, has, if, so, maintained, itself, by, vegetative, growth, floating, in, the, ocean, for, millions, of, years, other, species, endemic, to, the, sargasso, sea, include, the, sargassum, fish, a, predator, with, algae, like, appendages, which, hovers, motionless, among, the, sargassum, fossils, of, similar, fishes, have, been, found, in, fossil, bays, of, the, former, tethys, ocean, in, what, is, now, the, carpathian, region, that, were, similar, to, the, sargasso, sea, it, is, possible, that, the, population, in, the, sargasso, sea, migrated, to, the, atlantic, as, the, tethys, closed, at, the, end, of, the, miocene, around, 17, ma, the, origin, of, the, sargasso, fauna, and, flora, remained, enigmatic, for, centuries, the, fossils, found, in, the, carpathians, in, the, mid, 20th, century, often, called, the, quasi, sargasso, assemblage, finally, showed, that, this, assemblage, originated, in, the, carpathian, basin, from, where, it, migrated, over, sicily, to, the, central, atlantic, where, it, evolved, into, modern, species, of, the, sargasso, sea, the, location, of, the, spawning, ground, for, european, eels, remained, unknown, for, decades, in, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, discovered, that, the, southern, sargasso, sea, is, the, spawning, ground, for, both, the, european, and, american, eel, and, that, the, former, migrate, more, than, 5, 000, km, 3, 100, mi, and, the, latter, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, ocean, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, transport, eel, larvae, from, the, sargasso, sea, to, foraging, areas, in, north, america, europe, and, northern, africa, recent, but, disputed, research, suggests, that, eels, possibly, use, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, navigate, through, the, ocean, both, as, larvae, and, as, adults, climate, is, influenced, by, the, temperatures, of, the, surface, waters, and, water, currents, as, well, as, winds, because, of, the, ocean, s, great, capacity, to, store, and, release, heat, maritime, climates, are, more, moderate, and, have, less, extreme, seasonal, variations, than, inland, climates, precipitation, can, be, approximated, from, coastal, weather, data, and, air, temperature, from, water, temperatures, the, oceans, are, the, major, source, of, the, atmospheric, moisture, that, is, obtained, through, evaporation, climatic, zones, vary, with, latitude, the, warmest, zones, stretch, across, the, atlantic, north, of, the, equator, the, coldest, zones, are, in, high, latitudes, with, the, coldest, regions, corresponding, to, the, areas, covered, by, sea, ice, ocean, currents, influence, the, climate, by, transporting, warm, and, cold, waters, to, other, regions, the, winds, that, are, cooled, or, warmed, when, blowing, over, these, currents, influence, adjacent, land, areas, the, gulf, stream, and, its, northern, extension, towards, europe, the, north, atlantic, drift, is, thought, to, have, at, least, some, influence, on, climate, for, example, the, gulf, stream, helps, moderate, winter, temperatures, along, the, coastline, of, southeastern, north, america, keeping, it, warmer, in, winter, along, the, coast, than, inland, areas, the, gulf, stream, also, keeps, extreme, temperatures, from, occurring, on, the, florida, peninsula, in, the, higher, latitudes, the, north, atlantic, drift, warms, the, atmosphere, over, the, oceans, keeping, the, british, isles, and, northwestern, europe, mild, and, cloudy, and, not, severely, cold, in, winter, like, other, locations, at, the, same, high, latitude, the, cold, water, currents, contribute, to, heavy, fog, off, the, coast, of, eastern, canada, the, grand, banks, of, newfoundland, area, and, africa, s, northwestern, coast, in, general, winds, transport, moisture, and, air,

the, gibraltar, arc, in, the, western, mediterranean, is, migrating, westward, into, the, central, atlantic, where, it, joins, the, converging, african, and, eurasian, plates, together, these, three, tectonic, forces, are, slowly, developing, into, a, new, subduction, system, in, the, eastern, atlantic, basin, meanwhile, the, scotia, arc, and, caribbean, plate, in, the, western, atlantic, basin, are, eastward, propagating, subduction, systems, that, might, together, with, the, gibraltar, system, represent, the, beginning, of, the, closure, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, final, stage, of, the, atlantic, wilson, cycle, humans, evolved, in, africa, around, 7, mya, then, developing, stone, tools, around, 2, 6, mya, to, finally, evolve, as, modern, humans, around, 200, kya, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, complex, behavior, associated, with, this, behavioral, modernity, has, been, found, in, the, greater, cape, floristic, region, gcfr, along, the, coast, of, south, africa, during, the, latest, glacial, stages, the, now, submerged, plains, of, the, agulhas, bank, were, exposed, above, sea, level, extending, the, south, african, coastline, farther, south, by, hundreds, of, kilometers, a, small, population, of, modern, humans, probably, fewer, than, a, thousand, reproducing, individuals, survived, glacial, maxima, by, exploring, the, high, diversity, offered, by, these, palaeo, agulhas, plains, the, gcfr, is, delimited, to, the, north, by, the, cape, fold, belt, and, the, limited, space, south, of, it, resulted, in, the, development, of, social, networks, out, of, which, complex, stone, age, technologies, emerged, human, history, thus, begins, on, the, coasts, of, south, africa, where, the, atlantic, benguela, upwelling, and, indian, ocean, agulhas, current, meet, to, produce, an, intertidal, zone, on, which, shellfish, fur, seal, fish, and, sea, birds, provided, the, necessary, protein, sources, the, african, origin, of, this, modern, behaviour, is, evidenced, by, 70, 000, years, old, engravings, from, blombos, cave, south, africa, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, studies, indicate, that, 80, 60, 000, years, ago, a, major, demographic, expansion, within, africa, derived, from, a, single, small, population, coincided, with, the, emergence, of, behavioral, complexity, and, the, rapid, mis, 5, 4, environmental, changes, this, group, of, people, not, only, expanded, over, the, whole, of, africa, but, also, started, to, disperse, out, of, africa, into, asia, europe, and, australasia, around, 65, 000, years, ago, and, quickly, replaced, the, archaic, humans, in, these, regions, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, 20, 000, years, ago, humans, had, to, abandon, their, initial, settlements, along, the, european, north, atlantic, coast, and, retreat, to, the, mediterranean, following, rapid, climate, changes, at, the, end, of, the, lgm, this, region, was, repopulated, by, magdalenian, culture, other, hunter, gatherers, followed, in, waves, interrupted, by, large, scale, hazards, such, as, the, laacher, see, volcanic, eruption, the, inundation, of, doggerland, now, the, north, sea, and, the, formation, of, the, baltic, sea, the, european, coasts, of, the, north, atlantic, were, permanently, populated, about, 9, 8, 5, thousand, years, ago, this, human, dispersal, left, abundant, traces, along, the, coasts, of, the, atlantic, ocean, 50, kya, old, deeply, stratified, shell, middens, found, in, ysterfontein, on, the, western, coast, of, south, africa, are, associated, with, the, middle, stone, age, msa, the, msa, population, was, small, and, dispersed, and, the, rate, of, their, reproduction, and, exploitation, was, less, intense, than, those, of, later, generations, while, their, middens, resemble, 12, 11, kya, old, late, stone, age, lsa, middens, found, on, every, inhabited, continent, the, 50, 45, kya, old, enkapune, ya, muto, in, kenya, probably, represents, the, oldest, traces, of, the, first, modern, humans, to, disperse, out, of, africa, the, same, development, can, be, seen, in, europe, in, la, riera, cave, 23, 13, kya, in, asturias, spain, only, some, 26, 600, molluscs, were, deposited, over, 10, kya, in, contrast, 8, 7, kya, old, shell, middens, in, portugal, denmark, and, brazil, generated, thousands, of, tons, of, debris, and, artefacts, the, erteb, lle, middens, in, denmark, for, example, accumulated, 2, 000, m, 3, 71, 000, cu, ft, of, shell, deposits, representing, some, 50, million, molluscs, over, only, a, thousand, years, this, intensification, in, the, exploitation, of, marine, resources, has, been, described, as, accompanied, by, new, technologies, such, as, boats, harpoons, and, fish, hooks, because, many, caves, found, in, the, mediterranean, and, on, the, european, atlantic, coast, have, increased, quantities, of, marine, shells, in, their, upper, levels, and, reduced, quantities, in, their, lower, the, earliest, exploitation, however, took, place, on, the, now, submerged, shelves, and, most, settlements, now, excavated, were, then, located, several, kilometers, from, these, shelves, the, reduced, quantities, of, shells, in, the, lower, levels, can, represent, the, few, shells, that, were, exported, inland, during, the, lgm, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, covered, most, of, northern, north, america, while, beringia, connected, siberia, to, alaska, in, 1973, late, american, geoscientist, paul, s, martin, proposed, a, blitzkrieg, colonization, of, the, americas, by, which, clovis, hunters, migrated, into, north, america, around, 13, 000, years, ago, in, a, single, wave, through, an, ice, free, corridor, in, the, ice, sheet, and, spread, southward, explosively, briefly, attaining, a, density, sufficiently, large, to, overkill, much, of, their, prey, others, later, proposed, a, three, wave, migration, over, the, bering, land, bridge, these, hypotheses, remained, the, long, held, view, regarding, the, settlement, of, the, americas, a, view, challenged, by, more, recent, archaeological, discoveries, the, oldest, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, have, been, found, in, south, america, sites, in, northeast, siberia, report, virtually, no, human, presence, there, during, the, lgm, and, most, clovis, artefacts, have, been, found, in, eastern, north, america, along, the, atlantic, coast, furthermore, colonisation, models, based, on, mtdna, ydna, and, atdna, data, respectively, support, neither, the, blitzkrieg, nor, the, three, wave, hypotheses, but, they, also, deliver, mutually, ambiguous, results, contradictory, data, from, archaeology, and, genetics, will, most, likely, deliver, future, hypotheses, that, will, eventually, confirm, each, other, a, proposed, route, across, the, pacific, to, south, america, could, explain, early, south, american, finds, and, another, hypothesis, proposes, a, northern, path, through, the, canadian, arctic, and, down, the, north, american, atlantic, coast, early, settlements, across, the, atlantic, have, been, suggested, by, alternative, theories, ranging, from, purely, hypothetical, to, mostly, disputed, including, the, solutrean, hypothesis, and, some, of, the, pre, columbian, trans, oceanic, contact, theories, the, norse, settlement, of, the, faroe, islands, and, iceland, began, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, a, settlement, on, greenland, was, established, before, 1000, ce, but, contact, with, it, was, lost, in, 1409, and, it, was, finally, abandoned, during, the, early, little, ice, age, this, setback, was, caused, by, a, range, of, factors, an, unsustainable, economy, resulted, in, erosion, and, denudation, while, conflicts, with, the, local, inuit, resulted, in, the, failure, to, adapt, their, arctic, technologies, a, colder, climate, resulted, in, starvation, and, the, colony, got, economically, marginalized, as, the, great, plague, harvested, its, victims, on, iceland, in, the, 15th, century, iceland, was, initially,

vasco, da, gama, pedro, lvares, cabral, reached, brazil, taken, by, the, currents, of, the, south, atlantic, gyre, following, these, explorations, spain, and, portugal, quickly, conquered, and, colonized, large, territories, in, the, new, world, and, forced, the, amerindian, population, into, slavery, in, order, to, exploit, the, vast, quantities, of, silver, and, gold, they, found, spain, and, portugal, monopolized, this, trade, in, order, to, keep, other, european, nations, out, but, conflicting, interests, nevertheless, led, to, a, series, of, spanish, portuguese, wars, a, peace, treaty, mediated, by, the, pope, divided, the, conquered, territories, into, spanish, and, portuguese, sectors, while, keeping, other, colonial, powers, away, england, france, and, the, dutch, republic, enviously, watched, the, spanish, and, portuguese, wealth, grow, and, allied, themselves, with, pirates, such, as, henry, mainwaring, and, alexandre, exquemelin, they, could, explore, the, convoys, leaving, the, americas, because, prevailing, winds, and, currents, made, the, transport, of, heavy, metals, slow, and, predictable, in, the, colonies, of, the, americas, depredation, smallpox, and, others, diseases, and, slavery, quickly, reduced, the, indigenous, population, of, the, americas, to, the, extent, that, the, atlantic, slave, trade, had, to, be, introduced, to, replace, them, a, trade, that, became, the, norm, and, an, integral, part, of, the, colonization, between, the, 15th, century, and, 1888, when, brazil, became, the, last, part, of, the, americas, to, end, the, slave, trade, an, estimated, ten, million, africans, were, exported, as, slaves, most, of, them, destined, for, agricultural, labour, the, slave, trade, was, officially, abolished, in, the, british, empire, and, the, united, states, in, 1808, and, slavery, itself, was, abolished, in, the, british, empire, in, 1838, and, in, the, united, states, in, 1865, after, the, civil, war, from, columbus, to, the, industrial, revolution, trans, atlantic, trade, including, colonialism, and, slavery, became, crucial, for, western, europe, for, european, countries, with, direct, access, to, the,

fisheries, started, to, exploit, haddock, mackerel, and, lobster, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 1970s, the, introduction, of, european, and, asian, distant, water, fleets, in, the, area, dramatically, increased, the, fishing, capacity, and, the, number, of, exploited, species, it, also, expanded, the, exploited, areas, from, near, shore, to, the, open, sea, and, to, great, depths, to, include, deep, water, species, such, as, redfish, greenland, halibut, witch, flounder, and, grenadiers, overfishing, in, the, area, was, recognized, as, early, as, the, 1960s, but, because, this, was, occurring, on, international, waters, it, took, until, the, late, 1970s, before, any, attempts, to, regulate, was, made, in, the, early, 1990s, this, finally, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, the, atlantic, northwest, cod, fishery, the, population, of, a, number, of, deep, sea, fishes, also, collapsed, in, the, process, including, american, plaice, redfish, and, greenland, halibut, together, with, flounder, and, grenadier, endangered, marine, species, include, the, manatee, seals, sea, lions, turtles, and, whales, drift, net, fishing, can, kill, dolphins, albatrosses, and, other, seabirds, petrels, auks, hastening, the, fish, stock, decline, and, contributing, to, international, disputes, marine, pollution, is, a, generic, term, for, the, entry, into, the, ocean, of, potentially, hazardous, chemicals, or, particles, the, biggest, culprits, are, rivers, and, with, them, many, agriculture, fertilizer, chemicals, as, well, as, livestock, and, human, waste, the, excess, of, oxygen, depleting, chemicals, leads, to, hypoxia, and, the, creation, of, a, dead, zone, marine, debris, which, is, also, known, as, marine, litter, describes, human, created, waste, floating, in, a, body, of, water, oceanic, debris, tends, to, accumulate, at, the, center, of, gyres, and, coastlines, frequently, washing, aground, where, it, is, known, as, beach, litter, the, north, atlantic, garbage, patch, is, estimated, to, be, hundreds, of, kilometers, across, in, size, other, pollution, concerns, include, agricultural, and, municipal, waste, municipal, pollution, comes, from, the, eastern, united, states, southern, brazil, and, eastern, argentina, oil, pollution, in, the, caribbean, sea, gulf, of, mexico, lake, maracaibo, mediterranean, sea, and, north, sea, and, industrial, waste, and, municipal, sewage, pollution, in, the, baltic, sea, north, sea, and, mediterranean, sea, a, usaf, c, 124, aircraft, from, dover, air, force, base, delaware, was, carrying, three, nuclear, bombs, over, the, atlantic, ocean, when, it, experienced, a, loss, of, power, for, their, own, safety, the, crew, jettisoned, two, nuclear, bombs, which, were, never, recovered, north, atlantic, hurricane, activity, has, increased, over, past, decades, because, of, increased, sea, surface, temperature, sst, at, tropical, latitudes, changes, that, can, be, attributed, to, either, the, natural, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, amo, or, to, anthropogenic, climate, change, a, 2005, report, indicated, that, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, slowed, down, by, 30, between, 1957, and, 2004, in, 2024, research, highlighted, a, significant, weakening, of, the, amoc, by, approximately, 12, over, the, past, two, decades, if, the, amo, were, responsible, for, sst, variability, the, amoc, would, have, increased, in, strength, which, is, apparently, not, the, case, furthermore, it, is, clear, from, statistical, analyses, of, annual, tropical, cyclones, that, these, changes, do, not, display, multidecadal, cyclicity, therefore, these, changes, in, sst, must, be, caused, by, human, activities, the, ocean, mixed, layer, plays, an, important, role, in, heat, storage, over, seasonal, and, decadal, time, scales, whereas, deeper, layers, are, affected, over, millennia, and, have, a, heat, capacity, about, 50, times, that, of, the, mixed, layer, this, heat, uptake, provides, a, time, lag, for, climate, change, but, it, also, results, in, thermal, expansion, of, the, oceans, which, contributes, to, sea, level, rise, 21st, century, global, warming, will, probably, result, in, an, equilibrium, sea, level, rise, five, times, greater, than, today, whilst, melting, of, glaciers, including, that, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, expected, to, have, virtually, no, effect, during, the, 21st, century, will, likely, result, in, a, sea, level, rise, of, 3, 6, metres, 9, 8, 19, 7, ft, over, a, millennium, scientific, researchers, have, proposed, delimiting, the, boundary, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, by, two, different, natural, boundaries, by, the, shackleton, fracture, zone, and, by, the, scotia, arc, the, former, being, more, current, than, the, latter
