late, precambrian, rocks, that, are, part, of, the, ocoee, supergroup, this, group, consists, of, metamorphosed, sandstones, phyllites, schists, and, slate, early, precambrian, rocks, are, not, only, the, oldest, rocks, in, the, park, but, also, the, dominant, rock, type, in, sites, such, as, the, raven, fork, valley, and, upper, tuckasegee, river, between, cherokee, and, bryson, city, they, primarily, consist, of, metamorphic, gneiss, granite, and, schist, cambrian, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, found, among, the, bottom, of, the, foothills, to, the, northwest, and, in, limestone, coves, one, of, the, most, visited, attractions, in, the, mountains, is, cades, cove, which, is, a, window, or, an, area, where, older, rocks, made, out, of, sandstone, surround, the, valley, floor, of, younger, rocks, made, out, of, limestone, the, oldest, rocks, in, the, smokies, are, the, precambrian, gneiss, and, schists, which, were, formed, over, a, billion, years, ago, from, the, accumulation, of, marine, sediments, and, igneous, rock, in, the, late, precambrian, the, primordial, ocean, expanded, and, the, more, recent, ocoee, supergroup, rocks, formed, from, the, accumulation, of, eroding, land, mass, onto, the, continental, shelf, in, the, paleozoic, era, the, ocean, deposited, a, thick, layer, of, marine, sediments, which, left, behind, sedimentary, rock, during, the, ordovician, period, the, collision, of, the, north, american, and, african, tectonic, plates, initiated, the, alleghenian, orogeny, that, created, the, appalachian, range, during, the, mesozoic, era, rapid, erosion, of, softer, sedimentary, rocks, re, exposed, the, older, ocoee, supergroup, formations, around, 20, 000, years, ago, subarctic, glaciers, advanced, southward, across, north, america, and, although, they, never, reached, the, smokies, the, advancing, glaciers, led, to, colder, mean, annual, temperatures, and, an, increase, in, precipitation, throughout, the, range, trees, were, unable, to, survive, at, the, higher, elevations, and, were, replaced, by, tundra, vegetation, spruce, fir, forests, occupied, the, valleys, and, slopes, below, approximately, 4, 950, feet, 1, 510, m, the, persistent, freezing, and, thawing, during, this, period, created, the, large, blockfields, that, are, often, found, at, the, base, of, large, mountain, slopes, according, to, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, system, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, has, two, climate, types, humid, subtropical, cfa, and, temperate, oceanic, cfb, the, plant, hardiness, zone, at, clingmans, dome, visitor, center, is, 5b, with, an, average, annual, extreme, minimum, temperature, of, 14, 3, f, 25, 7, c, ascending, the, mountains, is, comparable, to, a, trip, from, tennessee, to, canada, the, humid, subtropical, air, mass, typically, in, place, over, the, smoky, mountains, coupled, with, orographic, lift, produces, large, amounts, of, precipitation, annual, precipitation, amounts, range, from, 50, 80, in, 1, 300, 2, 000, mm, with, heavy, winter, snowfall, in, the, higher, elevations, flash, flooding, often, occurs, after, heavy, rain, the, average, temperature, difference, between, the, mountains, such, as, newfound, gap, at, 5, 048, ft, 1, 539, m, above, msl, and, the, valleys, at, about, 1, 600, ft, 488, m, is, between, 10, 13, f, 5, 6, 7, 2, c, for, highs, and, between, 3, 6, f, 1, 7, 3, 3, c, for, lows, the, difference, between, high, temperatures, is, similar, to, the, moist, adiabatic, lapse, rate, of, 3, 3, f, 1, 8, c, per, 1, 000, ft, 300, m, while, the, smaller, difference, between, low, temperatures, is, the, result, of, frequent, temperature, inversions, developing, in, the, morning, most, often, in, autumn, strong, damaging, winds, of, 80, 100, mph, 130, 160, km, h, or, higher, occur, a, few, times, each, year, around, the, smoky, mountains, mainly, during, the, cool, season, from, october, to, april, as, a, result, of, a, phenomenon, known, as, mountain, waves, mountain, waves, are, strongest, in, a, narrow, area, along, the, foothills, and, can, create, extensive, areas, of, fallen, trees, and, roof, damage, especially, around, cades, cove, and, cove, mountain, strong, winds, created, by, mountain, waves, were, a, contributing, factor, in, the, devastating, gatlinburg, fire, on, november, 28, 2016, during, the, 2016, great, smoky, mountains, wildfires, damaging, winds, can, also, be, generated, by, strong, thunderstorms, with, tornadoes, and, strong, thunderstorm, complexes, also, known, as, mesoscale, convective, systems, occasionally, affecting, the, smoky, mountains, the, park, is, affected, by, air, pollution, because, of, increased, development, nearby, in, a, 2004, report, by, the, national, parks, conservation, association, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, was, considered, the, most, polluted, national, park, from, 1999, to, 2003, the, park, recorded, approximately, 150, unhealthy, air, days, the, equivalent, of, about, one, month, of, unhealthy, air, days, per, year, in, 2013, colorado, state, university, reported, that, with, the, passing, of, the, united, states, clean, air, act, in, 1970, and, the, subsequent, implementation, of, the, acid, rain, program, there, had, been, a, significant, improvement, to, the, air, quality, in, the, great, smoky, mountains, from, 1990, to, 2010, with, steady, improvements, in, noxious, emissions, visibility, in, the, park, on, the, haziest, days, has, improved, from, an, average, of, 9, miles, in, 1998, to, 40, miles, in, 2018, a, report, published, in, 2023, by, the, north, carolina, division, of, air, quality, indicates, significant, drops, in, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, oxides, of, nitrogen, volatile, organic, compounds, and, fine, particulate, matter, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, is, the, most, biologically, diverse, national, park, in, the, united, states, about, 19, 000, species, of, organisms, are, known, to, live, in, the, park, and, scientists, estimate, that, as, many, as, 80, 000, to, 100, 000, additional, species, may, also, be, present, the, land, now, protected, by, the, park, became, a, refuge, for, plants, and, animals, that, were, displaced, during, the, last, glacial, period, the, immense, biodiversity, is, also, supported, by, the, rainy, and, temperate, climate, no, other, location, of, similar, size, within, a, temperate, climate, is, known, to, match, the, park, s, biodiversity, forests, cover, approximately, 95, percent, of, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, the, lower, region, forests, are, dominated, by, deciduous, leafy, trees, at, higher, altitudes, deciduous, forests, give, way, to, coniferous, trees, like, fraser, fir, an, estimated, 20, to, 25, percent, of, the, forests, in, the, park, are, estimated, to, be, old, growth, forest, with, many, trees, that, predate, european, settlement, of, the, area, this, is, one, of, the, largest, blocks, of, deciduous, temperate, old, growth, forest, in, north, america, most, of, the, forest, is, a, mature, second, growth, hardwood, forest, the, variety, of, elevations, the, abundant, rainfall, and, the, presence, of, old, growth, forests, give, the, park, an, unusual, richness, of, biota, the, park, is, home, to, over, 1, 500, species, of, flowering, plants, more, than, in, any, other, national, park, in, north, america, these, include, 35, kinds, of, delicate, orchids, 27, violets, and, 58, members, of, the, lily, family, the, park, contains, 101, species, of, native, trees,

and, 563, lichen, species, are, found, in, the, park, plants, and, animals, common, in, the, country, s, northeast, have, found, suitable, ecological, niches, in, the, park, s, higher, elevations, while, southern, species, find, homes, in, the, balmier, lower, reaches, the, forests, of, the, smokies, are, typically, divided, into, three, zones, the, cove, hardwood, forests, in, the, stream, valleys, coves, and, lower, mountain, slopes, the, northern, hardwood, forests, on, the, higher, mountain, slopes, and, the, spruce, fir, or, boreal, forest, at, the, very, highest, elevations, appalachian, balds, patches, of, land, where, trees, are, unexpectedly, absent, or, sparse, are, interspersed, through, the, mid, to, upper, elevations, in, the, range, balds, include, grassy, balds, and, heath, balds, heath, balds, are, covered, mostly, in, shrubbery, that, is, part, of, the, heath, family, such, as, rhododendron, and, mountain, laurel, they, are, primarily, found, in, the, northeastern, part, of, the, park, on, narrow, ridges, at, elevations, between, 3, 600, and, 5, 200, feet, 1, 100, and, 1, 600, m, grass, balds, are, mountaintop, meadows, that, are, mostly, covered, in, grasses, and, sedges, they, are, typically, found, on, rounded, mountaintops, or, slopes, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, park, at, elevations, ranging, from, 4, 500, to, 5, 700, feet, 1, 400, to, 1, 700, m, mixed, oak, pine, forests, are, found, on, dry, ridges, especially, on, the, south, facing, north, carolina, side, of, the, range, cove, hardwood, forests, which, are, native, to, southern, appalachia, are, among, the, most, diverse, forest, types, in, north, america, the, cove, hardwood, forests, of, the, smokies, are, mostly, second, growth, although, some, 72, 000, acres, 290, km, 2, are, still, old, growth, they, are, found, in, the, valleys, between, mountain, ridges, at, elevations, below, 4, 500, feet, 1, 400, m, in, deep, moist, soil, the, albright, grove, along, the, maddron, bald, trail, between, gatlinburg, and, cosby, is, an, accessible, old, growth, forest, with, some, of, the, oldest, and, tallest, trees, in, the, entire, range, over, 130, species, of, trees, are, found, among, the, canopies, of, the, cove, hardwood, forests, in, the, smokies, the, dominant, species, include, yellow, birch, betula, alleghaniensis, basswood, tilia, americana, yellow,

and, ferns, a, unique, community, is, the, beech, gap, or, beech, orchard, beech, gaps, consist, of, high, mountain, gaps, that, have, been, monopolized, by, beech, trees, the, beech, trees, are, often, twisted, and, contorted, by, the, high, winds, that, occur, in, these, gaps, why, other, tree, types, such, as, the, red, spruce, fail, to, encroach, into, the, beech, gaps, is, unknown, the, southern, appalachian, spruce, fir, forest, also, called, the, boreal, or, canadian, forest, is, a, relict, of, the, ice, ages, when, mean, annual, temperatures, in, the, smokies, were, too, cold, to, support, a, hardwood, forest, while, the, rise, in, temperatures, between, 12, 500, and, 6, 000, years, ago, allowed, the, hardwoods, to, return, the, spruce, fir, forest, has, managed, to, survive, on, the, harsh, mountain, tops, typically, above, 5, 500, feet, 1, 700, m, about, 10, 600, acres, 43, km, 2, of, the, spruce, fir, forest, are, old, growth, the, spruce, fir, forest, consists, primarily, of, two, conifer, species, red, spruce, picea, rubens, and, fraser, fir, abies, fraseri, the, fraser, firs, which, are, native, to, southern, appalachia, once, dominated, elevations, above, 6, 200, feet, 1, 900, m, in, the, smokies, most, of, these, firs, were, killed, however, by, an, infestation, of, the, balsam, wooly, adelgid, which, arrived, in, the, smokies, in, the, early, 1960s, thus, red, spruce, is, now, the, dominant, species, in, the, range, s, spruce, fir, forest, large, stands, of, dead, fraser, firs, remain, atop, clingmans, dome, and, on, the, northwestern, slopes, of, old, black, while, much, of, the, red, spruce, stands, were, logged, in, the, 1910s, the, tree, is, still, common, throughout, the, range, above, 5, 500, feet, 1, 700, m, some, of, the, red, spruces, are, believed, to, be, 300, years, old, and, the, tallest, rise, to, over, 100, feet, 30, m, the, main, difference, between, the, southern, appalachian, spruce, fir, forest, and, the, spruce, fir, forests, in, northern, latitudes, is, the, dense, broad, leaved, understory, of, the, former, which, are, home, to, catawba, rhododendron, mountain, ash, pin, cherry, thornless, blackberry, and, hobblebush, the, herbaceous, and, litter, layers, are, poorly, lit, year, round, and, are, thus, dominated, by, shade, tolerant, plants, such, as, ferns, namely, mountain, wood, fern, and, northern, lady, fern, and, over, 280, species, of, mosses, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, has, over, 1, 400, flowering, plant, species, many, wildflowers, grow, in, mountains, and, valleys, including, bee, balm, solomon, s, seal, dutchman, s, breeches, various, trilliums, the, dragon, s, advocate, and, even, hardy, orchids, there, are, two, native, species, of, rhododendron, in, the, area, the, catawba, rhododendron, has, purple, flowers, in, may, and, june, while, the, rosebay, rhododendron, has, longer, leaves, and, white, or, light, pink, blooms, in, june, and, july, the, orange, to, sometimes, red, flowered, and, deciduous, flame, azalea, closely, follows, along, with, the, catawbas, the, closely, related, mountain, laurel, blooms, in, between, the, two, and, all, of, the, blooms, progress, from, lower, to, higher, elevations, the, reverse, is, true, in, autumn, when, nearly, bare, mountaintops, covered, in, rime, ice, frozen, fog, can, be, separated, from, green, valleys, by, very, bright, and, varied, leaf, colors, the, rhododendrons, are, broadleafs, whose, leaves, droop, in, order, to, shed, wet, and, heavy, snows, that, come, through, the, region, during,

reptiles, and, 43, species, of, amphibians, the, american, black, bear, is, perhaps, the, best, known, animal, that, resides, within, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, and, has, come, to, symbolize, wildlife, in, the, park, frequently, appearing, on, the, covers, of, the, park, s, literature, the, range, has, the, densest, american, black, bear, population, east, of, the, mississippi, river, most, of, the, range, s, adult, black, bears, weigh, between, 100, pounds, 45, kg, and, 300, pounds, 140, kg, although, some, weighing, as, much, as, 600, pounds, 270, kg, have, been, documented, in, the, park, an, estimated, 1, 900, black, bears, reside, in, the, park, although, the, exact, figure, is, variable, the, smokies, are, home, to, 27, species, of, rodents, including,

cataloochee, area, was, first, settled, by, the, caldwell, family, who, migrated, to, the, valley, in, 1834, like, most, of, southern, appalachia, the, early, 19th, century, economy, of, the, smokies, relied, on, subsistence, agriculture, the, average, farm, consisted, of, roughly, 50, acres, 0, 20, km, 2, part, of, which, was, cultivated, and, part, of, which, was, woodland, early, settlers, lived, in, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, x, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, log, cabins, although, these, were, replaced, by, more, elaborate, log, houses, and, eventually, as, lumber, became, available, by, modern, frame, houses, most, farms, included, at, least, one, barn, a, springhouse, used, for, refrigeration, a, smokehouse, used, for, curing, meat, a, chicken, coop, protected, chickens, from, predators, and, a, corn, crib, kept, corn, dry, and, protected, it, from, rodents, some, of, the, more, industrious, farmers, operated, gristmills, general, stores, and, sorghum, presses, religion, was, a, central, theme, in, the, lives, of, the, early, residents, of, the, smokies, and, community, life, was, typically, centered, on, churches, christian, protestantism, especially, primitive, baptists, missionary, baptists, methodists, and, presbyterians, dominated, the, religious, culture, of, the, region, particularly, because, of, their, pressure, to, acquire, land, in, the, deep, south, in, 1830, president, andrew, jackson, signed, the, indian, removal, act, beginning, the, process, that, eventually, resulted, in, the, forced, removal, of, all, native, american, tribes, east, of, the, mississippi, river, to, indian, territory, in, present, day, oklahoma, most, of, the, cherokee, were, removed, in, an, event, that, became, known, as, the, trail, of, tears, for, a, period, some, cherokees, led, by, such, warriors, as, tsali, evaded, removal, by, staying, in, the, area, now, part, of, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, a, band, on, the, oconaluftee, river, acquired, land, and, also, remained, their, descendants, make, up, most, of, the, federally, recognized, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, based, in, cherokee, north, carolina, and, their, qualla, boundary, reserve, to, the, south, of, the, park, while, both, tennessee, and, north, carolina, joined, the, confederacy, at, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1861, union, sentiment, in, the, great, smoky, mountains, was, much, stronger, relative, to, other, regions, in, these, two, states, generally, the, communities, on, the, tennessee, side, of, the, smokies, supported, the, union, while, communities, on, the, north, carolina, side, supported, the, confederates, on, the, tennessee, side, 74, of, cocke, countians, 80, of, blount, countians, and, 96, of, sevier, countians, voted, against, secession, in, the, north, carolina, smokies, cherokee, haywood, jackson, and, macon, counties, about, 46, of, the, population, favored, secession, this, was, largely, due, to, the, fact, that, slavery, was, rare, in, these, regions, as, the, geography, did, not, allow, for, large, plantation, complexes, dependent, on, slave, labor, that, came, to, dominate, the, economy, of, the, antebellum, south, while, no, major, engagements, took, place, in, the, smokies, minor, skirmishes, were, fairly, common, cherokee, chief, william, holland, thomas, formed, a, confederate, legion, made, up, mostly, of, cherokee, soldiers, thomas, legion, crossed, the, smokies, in, 1862, and, occupied, gatlinburg, for, several, months, to, protect, saltpeter, mines, atop, mount, le, conte, residents, of, predominantly, union, cades, cove, and, predominantly, confederate, hazel, creek, routinely, crossed, the, mountains, to, steal, one, another, s, livestock, residents, of, cosby, and, cataloochee, did, likewise, one, notable, civil, war, incident, was, the, murder, of, long, time, cades, cove, resident, russell, gregory, for, whom, gregory, bald, is, named, which, was, carried, out, by, bushwhackers, in, 1864, shortly, after, gregory, had, led, an, ambush, that, routed, a, band, of, confederates, seeking, to, wreak, havoc, in, the, cove, another, incident, was, george, kirk, s, raid, on, cataloochee, in, which, kirk, killed, or, wounded, 15, union, soldiers, recovering, at, a, makeshift, hospital, while, selective, logging, occurred, in, the, great, smoky, mountains, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, general, inaccessibility, of, the, forests, prevented, major, logging, operations, and, lumber, firms, initially, relied, on, the, lowland, forests, in, the, northeastern, united, states, and, the, mississippi, delta, in, the, southeast, as, timber, resources, in, these, regions, became, exhausted, and, as, the, demand, for, lumber, skyrocketed, after, the, civil, war, entrepreneurs, began, looking, for, ways, to, reach, the, virgin, forests, of, southern, appalachia, the, first, logging, operations, in, the, smokies, which, began, in, the, 1880s, used, splash, dams, or, booms, to, float, logs, down, rivers, to, lumber, mills, in, nearby, cities, notable, splash, dam, and, boom, operations, included, the, english, lumber, company, on, little, river, the, taylor, and, crate, operations, along, hazel, creek, and, the, ambitious, operations, of, alexander, arthur, on, the, pigeon, river, all, three, of, these, operations, failed, within, their, first, few, years, however, after, their, dams, and, boom, systems, were, destroyed, by, floods, innovations, in, logging, railroads, and, band, saw, technology, in, the, late, 19th, century, made, large, scale, logging, possible, in, the, mountainous, areas, of, southern, appalachia, the, largest, logging, operation, in, the, smokies, was, the, little, river, lumber, company, which, logged, the, little, river, watershed, between, 1901, and, 1939, the, firm, constructed, the, little, river, railroad, to, haul, timber, out, of, the, remote, regions, of, the, area, and, established, company, towns, at, townsend, named, for, the, company, s, chief, owner, and, manager, col, wilson, b, townsend, elkmont, and, tremont, the, little, river, railroad, set, an, example, for, larger, companies, to, also, purchase, land, in, the, smokies, for, logging, the, second, largest, logging, operation, was, the, ritter, lumber, company, which, logged, the, hazel, creek, watershed, between, 1907, and, 1928, ruins, of, ritter, s, lumbering, operations, are, still, visible, along, the, hazel, creek, trail, other, lumbering, operations, included, three, m, lumber, and, champion, fibre, both, of, which, logged, the, oconaluftee, watershed, logging, in, the, smokies, reached, its, peak, in, 1909, and, by, the, time, all, operations, ceased, in, the, 1930s, logging, firms, had, removed, two, thirds, of, the, virgin, forests, from, the, smokies, according, to, the, national, park, service, 80, of, the, smokies, was, clear, cut, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, idea, for, a, national, park, in, the, southern, appalachians, first, reportedly, arose, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, early, 20th, century, locals, began, banding, together, to, raise, money, for, the, preservation, of, the, land, as, its, natural, beauty, was, being, destroyed, by, the, cut, and, run, style, clearcutting, employed, by, the, timber, companies, wilson, b, townsend, the, head, of, little, river, lumber, began, advertising, elkmont, as, a, tourist, destination, in, 1909, within, a, few, years, the, wonderland, hotel, and, the, appalachian, club, had, been, established, to, cater, to, elite, knoxvillians, seeking, summer, mountain, getaways, when, the, national, park, service, was, established, in, 1916, they, wanted, a, park, in, the, eastern, united, states, but, did, not, have, the, funds, to, establish, one, at, the, time, in, the, summer, of, 1923, knoxville, resident, anne, may, davis, envisioned, a, national, park, in, the, great, smoky, mountains, while, visiting, yellowstone, national, park, davis, shared, her, idea, with, her, husband, knoxville, businessman, w, p, davis, who, shared, the, idea, with, then, secretary, of, interior, hubert, work, davis, initially, encountered, difficulty, in, gaining, support, for, the, movement, but, by, the, end, of, the, year, worked, with, several, appalachian, club, members, among, them, knoxville, businessman, colonel, david, c, chapman, and, the, knoxville, automobile, club, to, found, the, great, smoky, mountains, conservation, association, gsmca, in, 1924, secretary, work, established, the, southern, appalachian, national, park, committee, to, study, the, feasibility, of, a, national, park, in, the, southern, appalachians, on, july, 30, 1924, a, delegation, from, the, gsmca, met, with, the, park, committee, in, asheville, and, presented, a, series, of, photographs, of, the, park, to, the, committee, this, convinced, members, of, the, committee, many, of, whom, favored, a, national, park, in, the, grandfather, mountain, linville, gorge, area, to, visit, the, smokies, and, begin, pursuing, the, range, as, a, candidate, for, a, national, park, knoxville, mayor, ben, morton, travel, writer, horace, kephart, explorer, paul, m, fink, and, photographers, jim, thompson, and, george, masa, were, also, instrumental, in, fostering, the, development, of, the, park, the, movement, was, backed, by, automobile, clubs, most, of, which, were, chapters, of, the, american, automobile, association, in, addition, to, preservation, supporters, of, the, park, also, stressed, the, economic, benefit, of, tourism, on, december, 13, 1924, the, park, committee, recommended, the, establishment, of, national, parks, in, the, smokies, and, the, blue, ridge, mountains, in, virginia, the, latter, of, which, would, become, shenandoah, national, park, in, 1925, tennessee, governor, austin, peay, signed, legislation, authorizing, the, first, land, purchase, for, the, park, and, appointed, colonel, chapman, chairman, of, the, tennessee, state, park, and, forestry, commission, he, was, largely, responsible, for, raising, funds, for, land, purchases, and, coordinating, park, efforts, between, local, state, and, federal, entities, that, same, year, a, lodge, was, established, atop, mount, le, conte, by, hiker, paul, adams, to, entertain, visiting, dignitaries, from, washington, d, c, president, calvin, coolidge, signed, legislation, on, may, 22, 1926, which, authorized, the, park, but, there, was, no, nucleus, of, federally, owned, land, around, which, to, develop, it, in, 1927, both, states, legislatures, established, commissions, to, orchestrate, land, purchases, and, agreed, to, provide, the, first, appropriations, for, these, purchases, contingent, on, the, remaining, funds, being, raised, from, other, sources, north, carolina, provided, 2, million, equivalent, to, 28, 2, million, in, 2023, from, the, state, s, general, fund, and, tennessee, provided, 1, 5, million, equivalent, to, 21, 2, million, in, 2023, which, was, funded, by, a, special, gasoline, tax, private, citizens, raised, approximately, 1, million, equivalent, to, 14, million, in, 2023, but, struggled, to, raise, the, necessary, funds, until, businessman, and, philanthropist, john, d, rockefeller, jr, contributed, 5, million, equivalent, to, 70, 1, million, in, 2023, to, the, effort, in, march, 1928, the, creation, of, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, proved, much, more, complex, than, its, predecessors, in, the, west, which, were, largely, concocted, from, federally, owned, land, along, with, convincing, logging, firms, to, sell, lucrative, lumber, rights, the, park, commissions, had, to, negotiate, the, purchase, of, thousands, of, small, farms, and, remove, entire, communities, slowly, mountain, homesteaders, miners, and, loggers, were, evicted, from, their, land, farms, and, timbering, operations, were, abolished, to, establish, the, protected, areas, of, the, park, ben, w, hooper, who, had, served, as, governor, of, tennessee, from, 1911, to, 1915, served, as, the, principal, land, purchasing, agent, for, the, park, the, park, commissioners, also, had, to, deal, with, the, tennessee, and, north, carolina, legislatures, which, at, times, were, opposed, to, spending, taxpayer, money, on, park, efforts, in, spite, of, these, difficulties, the, park, commission, had, completed, most, major, land, purchases, by, 1932, during, the, great, depression, the, civilian, conservation, corps, the, works, progress, administration, and, other, federal, organizations, hired, workers, to, build, trails, firetowers, roads, and, other, infrastructure, in, the, park, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, was, officially, established, by,

crowd, of, approximately, 10, 000, people, the, park, saw, a, massive, increase, in, visitors, as, part, of, a, tourism, boom, during, the, post, world, war, ii, economic, expansion, the, federal, government, first, began, a, program, to, improve, roads, within, and, leading, to, the, park, at, the, end, of, the, war, later, a, number, of, new, facilities, were, constructed, to, handle, the, influx, in, visitors, as, part, of, mission, 66, a, nationwide, effort, to, improve, park, services, by, the, nps, 50th, anniversary, in, 1966, these, included, a, new, observation, tower, on, clingmans, dome, and, the, sugarlands, visitor, center, a, number, of, tourist, attractions, began, to, develop, in, gatlinburg, cherokee, and, other, nearby, towns, in, the, mid, 20th, century, to, cater, to, park, visitors, the, celebrity, status, of, country, music, singer, and, actress, dolly, parton, who, grew, up, in, nearby, pittman, center, tennessee, brought, further, attention, to, the, park, in, the, latter, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, in, 1986, parton, cofounded, the, theme, park, dollywood, in, pigeon, forge, with, herschend, family, entertainment, dollywood, resulted, in, a, further, tourist, attraction, boom, in, gatlinburg, pigeon, forge, and, sevierville, that, continues, to, the, present, day, these, attractions, combined, with, the, increasing, adoption, of, the, automobile, have, brought, additional, visitors, to, the, national, park, this, increase, in, tourism, has, greatly, strained, the, infrastructure, of, the, park, and, surrounding, areas, necessitating, additional, road, and, transportation, improvements, the, great, smoky, mountains, national, park, was, designated, an, international, biosphere, reserve, in, 1976, was, certified, as,

unusual, drought, which, accelerated, the, fires, the, wildfires, were, the, deadliest, in, the, eastern, united, states, since, the, great, fires, of, 1947, and, comprised, one, of, the, worst, natural, disasters, in, the, history, of, tennessee, in, 2023, the, national, park, was, featured, on, a, usps, priority, mail, express, stamp, depicting, a, scene, near, newfound, gap, the, stamp,
