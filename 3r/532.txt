of, the, poorest, countries, in, the, middle, east, as, of, 2013, yemen, had, a, gdp, ppp, of, us, 61, 63, billion, with, an, income, per, capita, of, 2, 500, services, are, the, largest, economic, sector, 61, 4, of, gdp, followed, by, the, industrial, sector, 30, 9, and, agriculture, 7, 7, of, these, petroleum, production, represents, around, 25, of, gdp, and, 63, of, the, government, s, revenue, after, the, start, of, the, civil, war, in, 2014, its, gdp, dropped, rapidly, by, over, 50, thanks, to, the, blockade, led, by, saudi, arabia, and, an, effective, embargo, on, oil, exports,

large, share, of, net, food, buying, households, 97, sorghum, is, the, most, common, crop, cotton, and, many, fruit, trees, are, also, grown, with, mangoes, being, the, most, valuable, a, big, problem, in, yemen, is, the, cultivation, of, khat, or, qat, a, psychoactive, plant, that, releases, a, stimulant, when, chewed, and, accounts, for, up, to, 40, percent, of, the, water, drawn, from, the, sana, a, basin, each, year, and, that, figure, is, rising, some, agricultural, practices, are, drying, the, sana, a, basin, and, displaced, vital, crops, which, has, resulted, in, increasing, food, prices, rising, food, prices, in, turn, pushed, an, additional, six, percent, of, the, country, into, poverty, in, 2008, alone, and, led, to, food, riots, starting, in, 2008, in, poorer, cities, efforts, are, being, made, by, the, government, and, dawoodi, bohra, community, at, northern, governorates, to, replace, qat, with, coffee, plantations, the, industrial, sector, is, centred, on,
