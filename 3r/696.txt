in, china, due, to, its, association, with, japanese, imperialism, and, ethnic, connotations, as, a, result, areas, once, considered, part, of, manchuria, are, simply, referred, to, as, the, northeast, the, three, provinces, and, the, northeast, were, also, in, concurrent, use, among, the, japanese, along, with, manchuria, until, the, mukden, incident, of, 1931, manchuria, is, now, most,

beijing, the, people, s, republic, of, china, indirectly, questioned, the, legitimacy, of, these, treaties, in, the, 1960s, but, has, more, recently, signed, agreements, such, as, the, 2001, sino, russian, treaty, of, friendship, which, affirm, the, current, status, quo, a, minor, exchange, nonetheless, occurred, in, 2004, at, the, confluence, of, the, amur, and, ussuri, rivers, various, senses, of, greater, manchuria, sometimes, further, include, sakhalin, island, which, despite, its, lack, of, mention, in, treaties, was, shown, as, qing, territory, on, period, chinese, japanese, russian, and, french, maps, of, the, area, the, geographical, term, manchuria, was, first, used, in, the, 18th, or, 19th, century, by, the, japanese, manchuria, variations, of, which, arrived, in, european, languages, through, dutch, is, a, calque, of, latin, of, the, japanese, placename, mansh, region, of, the, manchus, which, dates, from, the, 18th, century, according, to, the, american, researcher, mark, c, elliott, the, term, mansh, first, appeared, as, a, placename, in, katsuragawa, hosh, s, 1794, work, hokusa, bunryaku, in, two, maps, ashia, zenzu, and, chiky, hanky, s, zu, which, were, also, created, by, katsuragawa, according, to, junko, miyawaki, okada, japanese, geographer, takahashi, kageyasu, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, mansh, as, a, toponym, in, 1809, in, the, nippon, henkai, ryakuzu, and, it, was, from, that, work, that, westerners, adopted, the, name, by, the, 1830s, various, indo, european, forms, of, mansh, could, be, found, however, according, to, li, narangoa, the, term, was, introduced, to, japan, in, the, 18th, century, through, european, maps, following, jesuit, conventions, mansh, then, increasingly, appeared, on, maps, by, japanese, cartographers, such, as, kondi, j, z, takahashi, kageyasu, baba, sadayoshi, and, yamada, ren, their, maps, were, brought, to, europe, by, philipp, franz, von, siebold, according, to, japanese, scholar, nakami, tatsuo, siebold, was, the, one, who, brought, the, usage, of, the, term, manchuria, to, europeans, after, borrowing, it, from, the, japanese, who, were, the, first, to, use, it, in, a, geographic, manner, in, the, 18th, century, the, history, of, the, use, of, manchuria, as, a, toponym, in, china, is, uncertain, according, to, one, stream, of, thought, it, was, not, used, by, the, manchus, or, the, chinese, the, name, manchu, was, given, to, the, jurchen, people, by, hong, taiji, in, 1635, as, a, new, name, for, their, ethnic, group, however, neither, the, name, manchu, or, the, chinese, rendering, of, mansh, as, manzhou, ever, acquired, geographical, connotations, while, in, japanese, both, manchuria, and, manchu, are, rendered, as, mansh, according, to, nakami, tatsuo, manzhou, was, used, to, refer, to, manchu, people, or, one, of, their, states, rather, than, a, region, originally, manzhou, was, the, name, of, the, manchu, people, or, of, their, state, it, was, not, the, name, of, a, region, in, fact, neither, manchus, nor, han, chinese, have, ever, called, china, s, northeast, manzhou, even, advocates, of, an, independent, manchuria, such, as, inaba, iwakichi, acknowledged, this, in, 1912, british, diplomat, and, sinologist, herbert, giles, stated, in, china, and, the, manchus, that, manchuria, is, unknown, to, the, chinese, or, to, the, manchus, themselves, as, a, geographical, expression, according, to, owen, latimore, during, his, travels, in, china, during, the, late, 1920s, he, found, no, single, chinese, name, for, manchuria, as, a, unit, historical, geographer, philippe, for, t, concurred, noting, that, there, is, no, word, for, manchuria, in, either, chinese, or, manchu, languages, another, perspective, delineated, by, scholars, such, as, mark, c, elliott, and, li, narangoa, argues, that, manchu, consciousness, of, their, homeland, as, a, unique, place, contributed, to, the, creation, of, manchuria, as, a, distinct, geographical, entity, and, that, manchuria, manzhou, was, used, as, a, toponym, by, the, chinese, according, to, elliott, the, manchu, imperial, lineage, believed, that, their, original, homeland, was, the, changbai, mountains, the, qing, court, endeavored, to, create, a, regional, identity, focused, on, the, changbai, mountains, which, gradually, became, a, symbol, of, manchu, identity, however, it, is, uncertain, whether, that, notion, was, shared, among, ordinary, manchus, and, there, is, evidence, that, part, of, that, effort, was, to, combat, widespread, acculturation, among, manchus, resulting, in, the, loss, of, their, language, as, part, of, this, effort, jesuits, were, commissioned, to, create, maps, that, enhanced, manchu, conceptualization, of, their, homeland, which, elliot, believes, to, have, been, the, original, impetus, to, label, the, region, as, manchuria, in, european, and, japanese, maps, in, 1877, manzhou, was, used, as, a, toponym, in, an, essay, by, gong, chai, a, scholar, from, ningbo, the, description, of, manzhou, located, it, to, the, northeast, of, beijing, and, identified, it, as, the, birthplace, of, the, dynasty, manzhou, was, used, as, a, place, name, again, 20, years, later, by, qing, officials, manzhou, began, to, appear, on, chinese, maps, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 1900s, maps, that, used, manzhou, were, in, the, minority, during, the, early, republican, period, but, the, name, remained, in, common, use, among, the, chinese, communist, party, into, the, 1930s, names, for, the, region, were, relatively, fluid, before, the, mukden, incident, of, 1931, after, which, alternative, names, in, japanese, were, discarded, for, mansh, and, dongbei, northeast, and, dongsansheng, three, eastern, provinces, became, the, orthodox, names, for, the, chinese, according, to, mark, gamsa, manzhou, was, not, widely, used, among, the, chinese, but, the, people, s, republic, of, china, disapproved, of, it, regardless, by, the, 1950s, manzhou, had, virtually, disappeared, as, a, toponym, although, some, still, used, it, out, of, habit, the, term, manchuria, has, been, described, as, controversial, or, troublesome, by, several, scholars, including, mark, c, elliott, norman, smith, and, mariko, asano, tamanoi, the, historian, norman, smith, wrote, that, the, term, manchuria, is, controversial, based, on, reasons, outlined, by, mariko, asano, tamanoi, in, the, introduction, of, crossed, histories, manchuria, in, the, age, of, empire, 2005, according, to, tamanoi, manchuria, is, a, product, of, japanese, imperialism, and, to, call, the, area, manzhou, is, to, accept, uncritically, a, japanese, colonial, legacy, japan, used, the, name, manchuria, to, convey, the, idea, of, a, contested, region, distinct, from, china, while, china, insisted, on, its, ownership, of, the, region, by, rejecting, the, name, manchuria, japanese, colonists, who, returned, to, japan, from, manchukuo, in, the, post, war, period, used, terms, such, as, manshu, manchuria, man, m, manchuria, mongolia, and, m, man, mongolia, manchuria, almost, interchangeably, hyphenated, terms, such, as, man, s, n, manchuria, and, korea, and, man, m, manchuria, mongolia, emerged, in, japanese, media, and, traveler, writings, during, the, first, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, implying, that, these, regions, were, extensions, of, each, other, tamanoi, notes, that, the, name, manchuria, cannot, be, found, on, chinese, maps, and, acknowledged, that, she, should, use, the, term, in, quotation, marks, even, though, she, did, not, historian, bill, sewell, denies, that, manchuria, is, a, genuine, geographic, term, claiming, the, japanese, never, viewed, manchuria, as, a, discrete, entity, and, it, was, europeans, who, first, started, using, the, name, manchuria, to, refer, to, the, location, others, such, as, for, t, described, manchuria, as, a, solely, geographical, term, without, indicating, a, political, connection, and, used, it, in, that, capacity, despite, acknowledging, its, imperialistic, overtones, the, historian, gavan, mccormack, agreed, with, robert, h, g, lee, s, statement, that, the, term, manchuria, or, man, chou, is, a, modern, creation, used, mainly, by, westerners, and, japanese, with, mccormack, writing, that, the, term, manchuria, is, imperialistic, in, nature, and, has, no, precise, meaning, since, the, japanese, deliberately, promoted, the, use, of, manchuria, as, a, geographic, name, to, promote, its, separation, from, china, at, the, time, they, were, setting, up, their, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, in, the, 1920s, japanese, media, still, presented, manchuria, as, part, of, china, albeit, as, a, distinct, region, and, sometimes, called, it, the, garden, of, china, however, in, 1932, the, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, was, founded, covering, not, only, the, northeastern, three, provinces, but, also, parts, of, eastern, inner, mongolia, in, 1933, the, bureau, of, information, and, the, publicity, department, of, foreign, affairs, of, the, manchukuo, government, published, a, handbook, of, information, of, manchukuo, stating, that, manchuria, did, not, belong, to, china, had, its, own, history, and, traditions, and, was, the, home, of, the, manchus, and, mongols, elliot, notes, that, one, scholar, considered, the, use, of, manchuria, as, not, only, inaccurate, but, giving, approval, to, japanese, colonialism, during, the, ming, dynasty, the, area, in, which, the, jurchens, lived, was, referred, to, as, nurgan, during, the, qing, dynasty, the, region, was, known, as, the, three, eastern, provinces, d, ngs, nsh, ng, manchu, dergi, ilan, golo, which, referred, to, jilin, heilongjiang, and, fengtian, since, 1683, when, jilin, and, heilongjiang, were, separated, however, jilin, and, heilongjiang, did, not, receive, the, full, function, of, provinces, until, 1907, the, japanese, also, used, the, name, three, eastern, provinces, t, sansh, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, along, with, mansh, however, after, the, manchurian, incident, of, 1931, t, sansh, was, completely, replaced, by, mansh, in, japanese, usage, while, the, three, provinces, and, northeast, became, the, orthodox, name, for, the, same, region, in, chinese, usage, manchuria, has, been, referred, to, as, guandong, gu, nd, ng, which, literally, means, east, of, the, pass, and, similarly, guanwai, gu, nw, i, outside, the, pass, a, reference, to, shanhai, pass, in, qinhuangdao, in, today, s, hebei, at, the, eastern, end, of, the, great, wall, of, china, this, usage, is, seen, in, the, expression, chu, ng, gu, nd, ng, literally, rushing, into, guandong, referring, to, the, mass, migration, of, han, chinese, to, manchuria, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, name, guandong, later, came, to, be, used, more, narrowly, for, the, area, of, the, kwantung, leased, territory, on, the, liaodong, peninsula, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, southern, province, of, guangdong, the, term, manchuria, is, deprecated, among, people, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, due, to, its, association, with, japanese, imperialism, the,

china, is, predominantly, occupied, by, han, chinese, due, to, internal, chinese, migrations, and, sinicization, of, the, manchus, especially, during, the, qing, dynasty, it, is, considered, the,

traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, m, nzh, u, is, rarely, used, today, and, the, term, is, often, negatively, associated, with, the, japanese, imperial, legacy, and, the, puppet,

of, the, funnel, shaped, north, china, craton, a, large, area, of, tilled, and, overlaid, precambrian, rocks, spanning, 100, million, hectares, 250, million, acres, the, north, china, craton, was, an,

supercontinent, pangaea, no, part, of, manchuria, was, glaciated, during, the, quaternary, but, the, surface, geology, of, most, of, the, lower, lying, and, more, fertile, parts, of, manchuria, consists, of, very, deep, layers, of, loess, which, have, been, formed, by, the, wind, borne, movement, of, dust, and, till, particles, formed, in, glaciated, parts, of, the, himalayas, kunlun, shan,

almost, tropical, heat, in, summer, to, windy, dry, arctic, cold, in, winter, this, pattern, occurs, because, the, position, of, manchuria, on, the, boundary, between, the, great, eurasian, continental, landmass, and, the, huge, pacific, ocean, causes, complete, monsoonal, wind, reversal, in, summer, when, the, land, heats, faster, than, the, ocean, low, pressure, forms, over, asia, and,

every, winter, and, it, is, never, heavy, this, explains, why, corresponding, latitudes, of, north, america, were, fully, glaciated, during, glacial, periods, of, the, quaternary, while, manchuria,
