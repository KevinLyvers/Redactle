the, georgianisation, of, abkhazia, that, culminated, during, the, rule, of, joseph, stalin, and, lavrenti, beria, so, in, his, official, speeches, bagapsh, often, added, the, gali, georgians, to, population, estimates, of, the, abkhaz, disregarding, the, fact, that, they, still, thought, of, themselves, as, ethnic, georgians, rather, than, abkhaz, in, early, 2013, the, process, of,
