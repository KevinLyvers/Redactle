the, rhine, r, a, n, ryne, is, one, of, the, major, european, rivers, the, river, begins, in, the, swiss, canton, of, graub, nden, in, the, southeastern, swiss, alps, it, forms, the, swiss, liechtenstein, border, and, partly, the, swiss, austrian, and, swiss, german, borders, after, that, the, rhine, defines, much, of, the, franco, german, border, after, which, it, flows, in, a, mostly, northerly, direction, through, the, german, rhineland, finally, in, germany, the, rhine, turns, into, a, predominantly, westerly, direction, and, flows, into, the, netherlands, where, it, eventually, empties, into, the, north, sea, it, drains, an, area, of, 9, 973, km, 2, its, name, derives, from, the, celtic, r, nos, there, are, two, german, states, named, after, the, river, north, rhine, westphalia, and, rhineland, palatinate, in, addition, to, several, districts, e, g, rhein, sieg, the, departments, of, bas, rhin, and, haut, rhin, in, alsace, france, are, also, named, after, the, river, some, adjacent, towns, are, named, after, it, such, as, rheinau, rheineck, rheinfelden, ch, and, rheinfelden, d, the, international, commission, for, the, hydrology, of, the, rhine, basin, chr, and, euwid, contend, that, the, river, could, experience, a, massive, decrease, in, volume, or, even, dry, up, completely, in, case, of, drought, within, the, next, 30, to, 80, years, as, a, result, of, the, climate, crisis, the, rhine, is, the, second, longest, river, in, central, and, western, europe, after, the, danube, at, about, 1, 230, km, 760, mi, with, an, average, discharge, of, about, 2, 900, m, 3, s, 100, 000, cu, ft, s, the, rhine, and, the, danube, comprised, much, of, the, roman, empire, s, northern, inland, boundary, and, the, rhine, has, been, a, vital, navigable, waterway, bringing, trade, and, goods, deep, inland, since, those, days, the, various, castles, and, defenses, built, along, it, attest, to, its, prominence, as, a, waterway, in, the, holy, roman, empire, among, the, largest, and, most, important, cities, on, the, rhine, are, cologne, rotterdam, d, sseldorf, duisburg, strasbourg, arnhem, and, basel, the, variants, of, the, name, of, the, rhine, latin, rhenus, french, rhin, italian, reno, romansh, rain, or, rein, dutch, rijn, alemannic, ry, ripuarian, rhing, in, modern, languages, are, all, derived, from, the, gaulish, name, r, nos, which, was, adapted, in, roman, era, geography, 1st, century, bc, as, greek, rh, nos, latin, rhenus, the, spelling, with, rh, in, english, rhine, as, well, as, in, german, rhein, and, french, rhin, is, due, to, the, influence, of, greek, orthography, while, the, vocalization, i, is, due, to, the, proto, germanic, adoption, of, the, gaulish, name, as, r, naz, via, old, frankish, giving, old, english, r, n, old, high, german, r, n, early, middle, dutch, c, 1200, rijn, then, also, spelled, ryn, or, rin, the, modern, german, diphthong, rhein, also, used, in, romansh, rein, rain, is, a, central, german, development, of, the, early, modern, period, with, the, alemannic, name, r, n, keeping, the, older, vocalism, in, alemannic, the, deletion, of, the, ending, n, in, pausa, is, a, recent, development, the, form, rn, is, largely, preserved, in, lucernese, dialects, rhing, in, ripuarian, is, diphthongized, as, is, rhei, rhoi, in, palatine, while, spanish, has, adopted, the, germanic, vocalism, rin, italian, occitan, and, portuguese, have, retained, the, latin, ren, the, gaulish, name, r, nos, proto, celtic, or, pre, celtic, reinos, belongs, to, a, class, of, river, names, built, from, the, pie, root, rei, to, move, flow, run, also, found, in, other, names, such, as, the, reno, in, italy, the, grammatical, gender, of, the, celtic, name, as, well, as, of, its, greek, and, latin, adaptation, is, masculine, and, the, name, remains, masculine, in, german, dutch, french, spanish, and, italian, the, old, english, river, name, was, variously, inflected, as, masculine, or, feminine, and, its, old, icelandic, adoption, was, inflected, as, feminine, the, length, of, the, rhine, is, conventionally, measured, in, rhine, kilometers, rheinkilometer, a, scale, introduced, in, 1939, which, runs, from, the, 0, km, datum, at, old, rhine, bridge, in, the, city, of, konstanz, at, the, western, end, of, lake, constance, to, the, hook, of, holland, at, 1, 036, 20, km, the, river, is, significantly, shortened, from, its, natural, course, due, to, a, number, of, canal, projects, completed, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, the, total, length, of, the, rhine, to, the, inclusion, of, lake, constance, and, the, alpine, rhine, is, more, difficult, to, measure, objectively, it, was, cited, as, 1, 232, kilometers, 766, miles, by, the, dutch, rijkswaterstaat, in, 2010, its, course, is, conventionally, divided, as, follows, the, rhine, carries, its, name, without, distinctive, accessories, only, from, the, confluence, of, the, rein, anteriur, vorderrhein, and, rein, posteriur, hinterrhein, next, to, reichenau, in, tamins, above, this, point, is, the, extensive, catchment, area, of, the, headwaters, of, the, rhine, this, area, belongs, almost, exclusively, to, the, swiss, canton, of, grisons, graub, nden, ranging, from, saint, gotthard, massif, in, the, west, via, one, valley, lying, in, the, canton, of, ticino, and, sondrio, lombardy, italy, in, the, south, to, the, fl, ela, pass, in, the, east, the, rhine, is, one, of, four, major, rivers, taking, their, source, in, the, gotthard, region, along, with, the, ticino, drainage, basin, of, the, po, rh, ne, and, reuss, rhine, basin, the, witenwasserenstock, is, the, triple, watershed, between, the, rhine, rh, ne, and, po, traditionally, lake, toma, near, the, oberalp, pass, in, the, gotthard, region, is, seen, as, the, source, of, the, anterior, rhine, and, the, rhine, as, a, whole, the, posterior, rhine, rises, in, the, rheinwald, below, the, rheinwaldhorn, the, source, of, the, river, is, generally, considered, north, of, lai, da, tuma, tomasee, on, rein, anteriur, vorderrhein, although, its, southern, tributary, rein, da, medel, is, actually, longer, before, its, confluence, with, the, anterior, rhine, near, disentis, the, anterior, rhine, arises, from, numerous, source, streams, in, the, upper, surselva, and, flows, in, an, easterly, direction, one, source, is, lai, da, tuma, 2, 345, m, 7, 694, ft, with, the, rein, da, tuma, which, is, usually, indicated, as, source, of, the, rhine, flowing, through, it, into, it, flow, tributaries, from, the, south, some, longer, some, equal, in, length, such, as, the, rein, da, medel, the, rein, da, maighels, and, the, rein, da, curnera, the, cadlimo, valley, in, the, canton, of, ticino, is, drained, by, the, reno, di, medel, which, crosses, the, geomorphologic, alpine, main, ridge, from, the, south, all, streams, in, the, source, area, are, partially, sometimes, completely, captured, and, sent, to, storage, reservoirs, for, the, local, hydro, electric, power, plants, the, culminating, point, of, the, anterior, rhine, s, drainage, basin, is, the, piz, russein, of, the, t, di, massif, of, the, glarus, alps, at, 3, 613, meters, 11, 854, ft, above, sea, level, it, starts, with, the, creek, aua, da, russein, lit, water, of, the, russein, in, its, lower, course, the, anterior, rhine, flows, through, a, gorge, named, ruinaulta, flims, rockslide, the, whole, stretch, of, the, anterior, rhine, to, the, alpine, rhine, confluence, next, to, reichenau, in, tamins, is, accompanied, by, a, long, distance, hiking, trail, called, senda, sursilvana, the, posterior, rhine, flows, first, east, northeast, then, north, it, flows, through, the, three, valleys, named, rheinwald, schams, and, domleschg, heinzenberg, the, valleys, are, separated, by, the, rofla, gorge, and, viamala, gorge, its, sources, are, located, in, the, adula, alps, rheinwaldhorn, rheinquellhorn, and, g, ferhorn, the, avers, rhine, joins, from, the, south, one, of, its, headwaters, the, reno, di, lei, stowed, in, the, lago, di, lei, is, partially, located, in, italy, near, sils, the, posterior, rhine, is, joined, by, the, albula, from, the, east, from, the, albula, pass, region, the, albula, draws, its, water, mainly, from, the, landwasser, with, the, dischmabach, as, the, largest, source, stream, but, almost, as, much, from, the, gelgia, which, comes, down, from, the, julier, pass, numerous, larger, and, smaller, tributary, rivers, bear, the, name, of, the, rhine, or, equivalent, in, various, romansh, idioms, including, rein, or, ragn, including, next, to, reichenau, in, tamins, the, anterior, rhine, and, the, posterior, rhine, join, and, form, the, alpine, rhine, the, river, makes, a, distinctive, turn, to, the, north, near, chur, this, section, is, nearly, 86, km, long, and, descends, from, a, height, of, 599, meters, to, 396, meters, it, flows, through, a, wide, glacial, alpine, valley, known, as, the, rhine, valley, german, rheintal, near, sargan, a, natural, dam, only, a, few, meters, high, prevents, it, from, flowing, into, the, open, sztal, valley, and, then, through, lake, walen, and, lake, zurich, into, the, aare, the, alpine, rhine, begins, in, the, westernmost, part, of, the, swiss, canton, of, graub, nden, and, later, forms, the, border, between, switzerland, to, the, west, and, liechtenstein, and, later, austria, to, the, east, as, an, effect, of, human, work, it, empties, into, lake, constance, on, austrian, territory, and, not, on, the, border, that, follows, its, old, natural, river, bed, called, alter, rhein, lit, old, rhine, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, into, lake, constance, forms, an, inland, delta, the, delta, is, delimited, in, the, west, by, the, alter, rhein, and, in, the, east, by, the, modern, canalized, section, of, the, alpine, rhine, fu, acher, durchstich, most, of, the, delta, is, a, nature, reserve, and, bird, sanctuary, it, includes, the, austrian, towns, of, gai, au, h, chst, and, fu, ach, the, natural, rhine, originally, branched, into, at, least, two, arms, and, formed, small, islands, by, precipitating, sediments, in, the, local, alemannic, dialect, the, singular, is, pronounced, isel, and, this, is, also, the, local, pronunciation, of, esel, donkey, many, local, fields, have, an, official, name, containing, this, element, a, regulation, of, the, rhine, was, called, for, with, an, upper, canal, near, diepoldsau, and, a, lower, canal, at, fu, ach, in, order, to, counteract, the, constant, flooding, and, strong, sedimentation, in, the, western, rhine, delta, the, dornbirner, ach, had, to, be, diverted, too, and, it, now, flows, parallel, to, the, canalized, rhine, into, the, lake, its, water, has, a, darker, color, than, the, rhine, the, latter, s, lighter, suspended, load, comes, from, higher, up, the, mountains, it, is, expected, that, the, continuous, input, of, sediment, into, the, lake, will, silt, up, the, lake, this, has, already, happened, to, the, former, lake, tuggenersee, the, cut, off, old, rhine, at, first, formed, a, swamp, landscape, later, an, artificial, ditch, of, about, two, km, was, dug, it, was, made, navigable, to, the, swiss, town, of, rheineck, lake, constance, consists, of, three, bodies, of, water, the, obersee, upper, lake, the, untersee, lower, lake, and, a, connecting, stretch, of, the, rhine, called, the, seerhein, lake, rhine, the, lake, is, situated, in, germany, switzerland, and, austria, near, the, alps, specifically, its, shorelines, lie, in, the, german, states, of, bavaria, and, baden, w, rttemberg, the, austrian, state, of, vorarlberg, and, the, swiss, cantons, of, thurgau, and, st, gallen, the, rhine, flows, into, it, from, the, south, following, the, swiss, austrian, border, it, is, located, at, approximately, 47, 39, n, 9, 19, e, 47, 650, n, 9, 317, e, 47, 650, 9, 317, the, flow, of, cold, grey, mountain, water, continues, for, some, distance, into, the, lake, the, cold, water, flows, near, the, surface, and, at, first, does, not, mix, with, the, warmer, green, waters, of, upper, lake, but, then, at, the, so, called, rheinbrech, the, rhine, water, abruptly, falls, into, the, depths, because, of, the, greater, density, of, cold, water, the, flow, reappears, on, the, surface, at, the, northern, german, shore, of, the, lake, off, the, island, of, lindau, the, water, then, follows, the, northern, shore, until, hagnau, am, bodensee, a, small, fraction, of, the, flow, is, diverted, off, the, island, of, mainau, into, lake, berlingen, most, of, the, water, flows, via, the, constance, hopper, into, the, rheinrinne, rhine, gutter, and, seerhein, depending, on, the, water, level, this, flow, of, the, rhine, water, is, clearly, visible, along, the, entire, length, of, the, lake, the, rhine, carries, very, large, amounts, of, debris, into, the, lake, over, three, million, cubic, meters, 110, 000, 000, cu, ft, annually, in, the, mouth, region, it, is, therefore, necessary, to, permanently, remove, gravel, by, dredging, the, large, sediment, loads, are, partly, due, to, the, extensive, land, improvements, upstream, three, countries, border, the, obersee, namely, switzerland, in, the, south, austria, in, the, southeast, and, the, german, states, of, bavaria, in, the, northeast, and, baden, w, rttemberg, in, the, north, and, northwest, the, seerhein, is, only, 4, kilometers, 2, 5, mi, long, it, connects, the, obersee, with, the, 30, cm, lower, untersee, distance, markers, along, the, rhine, measure, the, distance, from, the, bridge, in, the, old, city, center, of, konstanz, for, most, of, its, length, the, seerhein, forms, the, border, between, germany, and, switzerland, the, exception, is, the, old, city, center, of, konstanz, on, the, swiss, side, of, the, river, the, seerhein, emerged, in, the, last, thousands, of, years, when, erosion, caused, the, lake, level, to, be, lowered, by, about, 10, meters, previously, the, two, lakes, formed, a, single, lake, as, the, name, still, suggests, like, in, the, obersee, the, flow, the, rhine, can, be, traced, in, the, untersee, here, too, the, river, water, is, hardly, mixed, with, the, lake, water, the, northern, parts, of, the, untersee, lake, zell, and, gnadensee, remain, virtually, unaffected, by, the, flow, the, river, traverses, the, southern, which, in, isolation, is, sometimes, called, rhinesee, lake, rhine, besides, the, seerhein, the, radolfzeller, aach, is, the, main, tributary, of, untersee, it, adds, large, amounts, of, water, from, the, danube, system, to, the, untersee, via, the, danube, sinkhole, reichenau, island, was, formed, at, the, same, time, as, the, seerhein, when, the, water, level, fell, to, its, current, level, lake, untersee, is, part, of, the, border, between, switzerland, and, germany, with, germany, on, the, north, bank, and, switzerland, on, the, south, except, both, sides, are, swiss, in, stein, am, rhein, where, the, high, rhine, flows, out, of, the, lake, the, high, rhine, hochrhein, begins, in, stein, am, rhein, at, the, western, end, of, the, untersee, now, flowing, generally, westwards, it, passes, over, the, rhine, falls, rheinfall, below, schaffhausen, before, being, joined, near, koblenz, in, the, canton, of, aargau, by, its, major, tributary, the, aare, the, aare, more, than, doubles, the, rhine, s, water, discharge, to, an, average, of, slightly, more, than, 1, 000, m, 3, s, 35, 000, cu, ft, s, and, provides, more, than, a, fifth, of, the, discharge, at, the, dutch, border, the, aare, also, contains, the, waters, from, the, 4, 274, m, 14, 022, ft, summit, of, finsteraarhorn, the, highest, point, of, the, rhine, basin, between, eglisau, and, basel, the, vast, majority, of, its, length, the, high, rhine, forms, the, border, between, germany, and, switzerland, only, for, brief, distances, at, its, extremities, does, the, river, run, entirely, within, switzerland, at, the, eastern, end, it, separates, the, bulk, of, the, canton, of, schaffhausen, and, the, german, exclave, of, b, singen, am, hochrhein, on, the, northern, bank, from, cantons, of, z, rich, and, thurgau, while, at, the, western, end, it, bisects, the, canton, of, basel, stadt, here, at, the, rhine, knee, the, river, turns, north, and, leaves, switzerland, altogether, the, high, rhine, is, characterized, by, numerous, dams, on, the, few, remaining, natural, sections, there, are, still, several, rapids, over, its, entire, course, from, lake, constance, to, the, swiss, border, at, basel, the, river, descends, from, 395, m, to, 252, m, in, the, center, of, basel, the, first, major, city, in, the, course, of, the, stream, is, the, rhine, knee, a, major, bend, where, the, overall, direction, of, the, rhine, changes, from, west, to, north, here, the, high, rhine, ends, legally, the, central, bridge, is, the, boundary, between, high, and, upper, rhine, the, river, now, flows, north, as, upper, rhine, through, the, upper, rhine, plain, which, is, about, 300, km, long, and, up, to, 40, km, wide, the, most, important, tributaries, in, this, area, are, the, ill, below, of, strasbourg, the, neckar, in, mannheim, and, the, main, across, from, mainz, in, mainz, the, rhine, leaves, the, upper, rhine, valley, and, flows, through, the, mainz, basin, the, southern, half, of, the, upper, rhine, forms, the, border, between, france, alsace, and, germany, baden, w, rttemberg, the, northern, part, forms, the, border, between, the, german, states, of, rhineland, palatinate, in, the, west, on, the, one, hand, and, baden, w, rttemberg, and, hesse, on, the, other, hand, in, the, east, and, north, a, curiosity, of, this, border, line, is, that, the, parts, of, the, city, of, mainz, on, the, right, bank, of, the, rhine, were, given, to, hesse, by, the, occupying, forces, in, 1945, the, upper, rhine, was, a, significant, cultural, landscape, in, central, europe, already, in, antiquity, and, during, the, middle, ages, today, the, upper, rhine, area, hosts, many, important, manufacturing, and, service, industries, particularly, in, the, centers, basel, strasbourg, and, mannheim, ludwigshafen, strasbourg, is, the, seat, of, the, european, parliament, and, so, one, of, the, three, european, capitals, is, located, on, the, upper, rhine, the, upper, rhine, region, was, changed, significantly, by, a, rhine, straightening, program, in, the, 19th, century, the, rate, of, flow, was, increased, and, the, ground, water, level, fell, significantly, dead, branches, were, removed, by, construction, workers, and, the, area, around, the, river, was, made, more, habitable, for, humans, on, flood, plains, as, the, rate, of, flooding, decreased, sharply, on, the, french, side, the, grand, canal, d, alsace, was, dug, which, carries, a, significant, part, of, the, river, water, and, all, of, the, traffic, in, some, places, there, are, large, compensation, pools, for, example, the, huge, bassin, de, compensation, de, plobsheim, in, alsace, the, upper, rhine, has, undergone, significant, human, change, since, the, 19th, century, while, it, was, slightly, modified, during, the, roman, occupation, it, was, not, until, the, emergence, of, engineers, such, as, johann, gottfried, tulla, that, significant, modernization, efforts, changed, the, shape, of, the, river, earlier, work, under, frederick, the, great, surrounded, efforts, to, ease, shipping, and, construct, dams, to, serve, coal, transportation, tulla, is, considered, to, have, domesticated, the, upper, rhine, a, domestication, that, served, goals, such, as, reducing, stagnant, bogs, that, fostered, waterborne, diseases, making, regions, more, habitable, for, human, settlement, and, reduce, high, frequency, of, floods, not, long, before, tulla, went, to, work, on, widening, and, straightening, the, river, heavy, floods, caused, significant, loss, of, life, four, diplomatic, treaties, were, signed, among, german, state, governments, and, french, regions, dealing, with, the, changes, proposed, along, the, rhine, one, was, the, treaty, for, the, rectification, of, the, rhine, flow, from, neuberg, to, dettenheim, 1817, which, surrounded, states, such, as, bourbon, france, and, the, bavarian, palatinate, loops, oxbows, branches, and, islands, were, removed, along, the, upper, rhine, so, that, there, would, be, uniformity, to, the, river, the, engineering, of, the, rhine, was, not, without, protest, farmers, and, fishermen, had, grave, concerns, about, valuable, fishing, areas, and, farmland, being, lost, while, some, areas, lost, ground, other, areas, saw, swamps, and, bogs, be, drained, and, turned, into, arable, land, johann, tulla, had, the, goal, of, shortening, and, straightening, the, upper, rhine, early, engineering, projects, the, upper, rhine, also, had, issues, with, tulla, s, project, at, one, part, of, the, river, creating, rapids, after, the, rhine, cut, down, from, erosion, to, sheer, rock, engineering, along, the, rhine, eased, flooding, and, made, transportation, along, the, river, less, cumbersome, these, state, projects, were, part, of, the, advanced, and, technical, progress, going, on, in, the, country, alongside, the, industrial, revolution, for, the, german, state, making, the, river, more, predictable, was, to, ensure, development, projects, could, easily, commence, the, section, of, the, upper, rhine, downstream, from, mainz, is, also, known, as, the, island, rhine, here, a, number, of, river, islands, occur, locally, known, as, rheinauen, the, rhine, is, the, longest, river, in, germany, it, is, here, that, the, rhine, encounters, some, more, of, its, main, tributaries, such, as, the, neckar, the, main, and, later, the, moselle, which, contributes, an, average, discharge, of, more, than, 300, m, 3, s, 11, 000, cu, ft, s, northeastern, france, drains, to, the, rhine, via, the, moselle, smaller, rivers, drain, the, vosges, and, jura, mountains, uplands, most, of, luxembourg, and, a, very, small, part, of, belgium, also, drain, to, the, rhine, via, the, moselle, as, it, approaches, the, dutch, border, the, rhine, has, an, annual, mean, discharge, of, 2, 290, m, 3, s, 81, 000, cu, ft, s, and, an, average, width, of, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, between, bingen, am, rhein, and, bonn, the, middle, rhine, flows, through, the, rhine, gorge, a, formation, which, was, created, by, erosion, the, rate, of, erosion, equaled, the, uplift, in, the, region, such, that, the, river, was, left, at, about, its, original, level, while, the, surrounding, lands, raised, the, gorge, is, quite, deep, and, is, the, stretch, of, the, river, which, is, known, for, its, many, castles, and, vineyards, it, is, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, 2002, and, known, as, the, romantic, rhine, with, more, than, 40, castles, and, fortresses, from, the, middle, ages, and, many, quaint, and, lovely, country, villages, the, mainz, basin, ends, in, bingen, am, rhein, the, rhine, continues, as, middle, rhine, into, the, rhine, gorge, in, the, rhenish, slate, mountains, in, this, sections, the, river, falls, from, 77, 4, m, above, sea, level, to, 50, 4, m, on, the, left, is, located, the, mountain, ranges, of, hunsr, ck, and, eifel, on, the, right, taunus, and, westerwald, according, to, geologists, the, characteristic, narrow, valley, form, was, created, by, erosion, by, the, river, while, the, surrounding, landscape, was, lifted, see, water, gap, major, tributaries, in, this, section, are, the, lahn, and, the, moselle, they, join, the,

sectors, in, the, middle, rhine, area, are, viniculture, and, tourism, the, rhine, gorge, between, r, desheim, am, rhein, and, koblenz, is, listed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, near, sankt, goarshausen, the, rhine, flows, around, the, famous, rock, lorelei, with, its, outstanding, architectural, monuments, the, slopes, full, of, vines, settlements, crowded, on, the, narrow, river, banks, and, scores, of, castles, lined, up, along, the, top, of, the, steep, slopes, the, middle, rhine, valley, can, be, considered, the, epitome, of, the, rhine, romanticism, in, bonn, where, the, sieg, flows, into, the, rhine, the, rhine, enters, the, north, german, plain, and, turns, into, the, lower, rhine, the, lower, rhine, falls, from, 50, m, to, 12, m, the, main, tributaries, on, this, stretch, are, the, ruhr, and, the, lippe, like, the, upper, rhine, the, lower, rhine, used, to, meander, until, engineering, created, a, solid, river, bed, because, the, levees, are, some, distance, from, the, river, at, high, tide, the, lower, rhine, has, more, room, for, widening, than, the, upper, rhine, the, lower, rhine, flows, through, north, rhine, westphalia, its, banks, are, usually, heavily, populated, and, industrialized, in, particular, the, agglomerations, cologne, d, sseldorf, and, ruhr, area, here, the, rhine, flows, through, the, largest, conurbation, in, germany, the, rhine, ruhr, region, one, of, the, most, important, cities, in, this, region, is, duisburg, with, the, largest, river, port, in, europe, duisport, the, region, downstream, of, duisburg, is, more, agricultural, in, wesel, 30, km, downstream, of, duisburg, is, located, the, western, end, of, the, second, east, west, shipping, route, the, wesel, datteln, canal, which, runs, parallel, to, the, lippe, between, emmerich, and, cleves, the, emmerich, rhine, bridge, the, longest, suspension, bridge, in, germany, crosses, the, 400, meter, wide, 1, 300, ft, river, near, krefeld, the, river,

between, bad, honnef, and, rolandseck, where, the, lohfelderf, hre, district, is, situated, until, the, early, 1980s, industry, was, a, major, source, of, water, pollution, although, many, plants, and, factories, can, be, found, along, the, rhine, up, into, switzerland, it, is, along, the, lower, rhine, that, the, bulk, of, them, are, concentrated, as, the, river, passes, the, major, cities, of, cologne, d, sseldorf, and, duisburg, duisburg, is, the, home, of, europe, s, largest, inland, port, and, functions, as, a, hub, to, the, sea, ports, of, rotterdam, antwerp, and, amsterdam, the, ruhr, which, joins, the, rhine, in, duisburg, is, nowadays, a, clean, river, thanks, to, a, combination, of, stricter, environmental, controls, a, transition, from, heavy, industry, to, light, industry, and, cleanup, measures, such, as, the, reforestation, of, slag, and, brownfields, the, ruhr, currently, provides, the, region, with, drinking, water, it, contributes, 70, m, 3, s, 2, 500, cu, ft, s, to, the, rhine, other, rivers, in, the, ruhr, area, include, the, emscher, the, dutch, name, for, rhine, is, rijn, the, rhine, turns, west, and, enters, the, netherlands, where, together, with, the, rivers, meuse, and, scheldt, it, forms, the, extensive, rhine, meuse, scheldt, delta, with, 25, 347, km, 2, 9, 787, sq, mi, the, largest, river, delta, in, europe, crossing, the, border, into, the, netherlands, at, spijk, close, to, nijmegen, and, arnhem, the, rhine, is, at, its, widest, although, the, river, then, splits, into, three, main, distributaries, the, waal, nederrijn, nether, rhine, and, ijssel, from, here, the, situation, becomes, more, complicated, as, the, dutch, name, rijn, no, longer, coincides, with, the, main, flow, of, water, two, thirds, of, the, water, flow, volume, of, the, rhine, flows, farther, west, through, the, waal, and, then, via, the, merwede, and, nieuwe, merwede, de, biesbosch, merging, with, the, meuse, through, the, hollands, diep, and, haringvliet, estuaries, into, the, north, sea, the, beneden, merwede, branches, off, near, hardinxveld, giessendam, and, continues, as, the, noord, to, join, the, lek, near, the, village, of, kinderdijk, to, form, the, nieuwe, maas, then, flows, past, rotterdam, and, continues, via, het, scheur, and, the, nieuwe, waterweg, to, the, north, sea, the, oude, maas, branches, off, near, dordrecht, farther, down, rejoining, the, nieuwe, maas, to, form, het, scheur, the, other, third, of, the, water, flows, through, the, pannerdens, kanaal, and, redistributes, in, the, ijssel, and, nederrijn, the, ijssel, branch, carries, one, ninth, of, the, water, flow, of, the, rhine, north, into, the, ijsselmeer, a, former, bay, while, the, nederrijn, carries, approximately, two, ninths, of, the, flow, west, along, a, route, parallel, to, the, waal, however, at, wijk, bij, duurstede, the, nederrijn, changes, its, name, and, becomes, the, lek, it, flows, farther, west, to, rejoin, the, noord, into, the, nieuwe, maas, and, to, the, north, sea, the, name, rijn, from, here, on, is, used, only, for, smaller, streams, farther, to, the, north, which, together, formed, the, main, river, rhine, in, roman, times, though, they, retained, the, name, these, streams, no, longer, carry, water, from, the, rhine, but, are, used, for, draining, the, surrounding, land, and, polders, from, wijk, bij, duurstede, the, old, north, branch, of, the, rhine, is, called, kromme, rijn, bent, rhine, past, utrecht, first, leidse, rijn, rhine, of, leiden, and, then, oude, rijn, old, rhine, the, latter, flows, west, into, a, sluice, at, katwijk, where, its, waters, can, be, discharged, into, the, north, sea, this, branch, once, formed, the, line, along, which, the, limes, germanicus, were, built, during, periods, of, lower, sea, levels, within, the, various, ice, ages, the, rhine, took, a, left, turn, creating, the, channel, river, the, course, of, which, now, lies, below, the, english, channel, the, rhine, meuse, delta, the, most, important, natural, region, of, the, netherlands, begins, near, millingen, aan, de, rijn, close, to, the, dutch, german, border, with, the, division, of, the, rhine, into, waal, and, nederrijn, the, region, between, the, dutch, german, border, and, rotterdam, where, the, waal, lek, and, meuse, run, more, or, less, parallel, is, colloquially, known, as, the, great, rivers, since, the, rhine, contributes, most, of, the, water, the, shorter, term, rhine, delta, is, commonly, used, however, this, name, is, also, used, for, the, river, delta, where, the, rhine, flows, into, lake, constance, so, it, is, clearer, to, call, the, larger, one, rhine, meuse, delta, or, even, rhine, meuse, scheldt, delta, as, the, scheldt, ends, in, the, same, delta, the, shape, of, the, rhine, delta, is, determined, by, two, bifurcations, first, at, millingen, aan, de, rijn, the, rhine, splits, into, waal, and, pannerdens, kanaal, which, changes, its, name, to, nederrijn, at, angeren, and, second, near, arnhem, the, ijssel, branches, off, from, the, nederrijn, this, creates, three, main, flows, two, of, which, change, names, rather, often, the, largest, and, southern, main, branch, begins, as, waal, and, continues, as, boven, merwede, upper, merwede, beneden, merwede, lower, merwede, noord, the, north, nieuwe, maas, new, meuse, het, scheur, the, rip, and, nieuwe, waterweg, new, waterway, the, middle, flow, begins, as, nederrijn, then, changes, into, lek, then, joins, the, noord, thereby, forming, nieuwe, maas, the, northern, flow, keeps, the, name, ijssel, until, it, flows, into, lake, ijsselmeer, three, more, flows, carry, significant, amounts, of, water, the, nieuwe, merwede, new, merwede, which, branches, off, from, the, southern, branch, where, it, changes, from, boven, to, beneden, merwede, the, oude, maas, old, meuse, which, branches, off, from, the, southern, branch, where, it, changes, from, beneden, merwede, into, noord, and, dordtse, kil, which, branches, off, from, oude, maas, before, the, st, elizabeth, s, flood, 1421, the, meuse, flowed, just, south, of, today, s, line, merwede, oude, maas, to, the, north, sea, and, formed, an, archipelago, like, estuary, with, waal, and, lek, this, system, of, numerous, bays, estuary, like, extended, rivers, many, islands, and, constant, changes, of, the, coastline, is, hard, to, imagine, today, from, 1421, to, 1904, the, meuse, and, waal, merged, further, upstream, at, gorinchem, to, form, merwede, for, flood, protection, reasons, the, meuse, was, separated, from, the, waal, through, a, lock, and, diverted, into, a, new, outlet, called, bergse, maas, then, amer, and, then, flows, into, the, former, bay, hollands, diep, the, northwestern, part, of, the, estuary, around, hook, of, holland, is, still, called, maasmond, meuse, mouth, ignoring, the, fact, that, it, now, carries, only, water, from, the, rhine, this, might, explain, the, confusing, naming, of, the, various, branches, the, hydrography, of, the, current, delta, is, characterized, by, the, delta, s, main, arms, disconnected, arms, hollandse, ijssel, linge, vecht, etc, and, smaller, rivers, and, streams, many, rivers, have, been, closed, dammed, and, now, serve, as, drainage, channels, for, the, numerous, polders, the, construction, of, delta, works, changed, the, delta, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, fundamentally, currently, rhine, water, runs, into, the, sea, or, into, former, marine, bays, now, separated, from, the, sea, in, five, places, namely, at, the, mouths, of, the, nieuwe, merwede, nieuwe, waterway, nieuwe, maas, dordtse, kil, spui, and, ijssel, the, rhine, meuse, delta, is, a, tidal, delta, shaped, not, only, by, the, sedimentation, of, the, rivers, but, also, by, tidal, currents, this, meant, that, high, tide, formed, a, serious, risk, because, strong, tidal, currents, could, tear, huge, areas, of, land, into, the, sea, before, the, construction, of, the, delta, works, tidal, influence, was, palpable, up, to, nijmegen, and, even, today, after, the, regulatory, action, of, the, delta, works, the, tide, acts, far, inland, at, the, waal, the, most, landward, tidal, influence, can, be, detected, between, brakel, and, zaltbommel, the, rhine, flows, from, the, alps, to, the, north, sea, basin, the, geography, and, geology, of, its, present, day, watershed, has, been, developing, since, the, alpine, orogeny, began, in, southern, europe, the, stage, was, set, in, the, triassic, period, of, the, mesozoic, era, with, the, opening, of, the, tethys, ocean, between, the, eurasian, and, african, tectonic, plates, between, about, 240, mbp, and, 220, mbp, million, years, before, present, the, present, mediterranean, sea, descends, from, this, somewhat, larger, tethys, sea, at, about, 180, mbp, in, the, jurassic, period, the, two, plates, reversed, direction, and, began, to, compress, the, tethys, floor, causing, it, to, be, subducted, under, eurasia, and, pushing, up, the, edge, of, the, latter, plate, in, the, alpine, orogeny, of, the, oligocene, and, miocene, periods, several, microplates, were, caught, in, the, squeeze, and, rotated, or, were, pushed, laterally, generating, the, individual, features, of, mediterranean, geography, iberia, pushed, up, the, pyrenees, italy, the, alps, and, anatolia, moving, west, the, mountains, of, greece, and, the, islands, the, compression, and, orogeny, continue, today, as, shown, by, the, ongoing, raising, of, the, mountains, a, small, amount, each, year, and, the, active, volcanoes, in, northern, europe, the, north, sea, basin, had, formed, during, the, triassic, and, jurassic, periods, and, continued, to, be, a, sediment, receiving, basin, since, in, between, the, zone, of, alpine, orogeny, and, north, sea, basin, subsidence, highlands, resulting, from, an, earlier, orogeny, variscan, remained, such, as, the, ardennes, eifel, and, vosges, from, the, eocene, onward, the, ongoing, alpine, orogeny, caused, a, north, south, rift, system, to, develop, in, this, zone, the, main, elements, of, this, rift, are, the, upper, rhine, graben, in, southwest, germany, and, eastern, france, and, the, lower, rhine, embayment, in, northwest, germany, and, the, southeastern, netherlands, by, the, time, of, the, miocene, a, river, system, had, developed, in, the, upper, rhine, graben, that, continued, northward, and, is, considered, the, first, rhine, river, at, that, time, it, did, not, yet, carry, discharge, from, the, alps, instead, the, watersheds, of, the, rhone, and, danube, drained, the, northern, flanks, of, the, alps, the, watershed, of, the, rhine, reaches, into, the, alps, today, but, it, did, not, start, out, that, way, in, the, miocene, period, the, watershed, of, the, rhine, reached, south, only, to, the, eifel, and, westerwald, hills, about, 450, km, 280, mi, north, of, the, alps, the, rhine, then, had, the, sieg, as, a, tributary, but, not, yet, the, moselle, the, northern, alps, were, then, drained, by, the, danube, through, stream, capture, the, rhine, extended, its, watershed, southward, by, the, pliocene, period, the, rhine, had, captured, streams, down, to, the, vosges, mountains, including, the, main, and, the, neckar, the, northern, alps, were, then, drained, by, the, rhone, by, the, early, pleistocene, period, the, rhine, had, captured, most, of, its, current, alpine, watershed, from, the, rh, ne, including, the, aare, since, that, time, the, rhine, has, added, the, watershed, above, lake, constance, vorderrhein, hinterrhein, alpenrhein, captured, from, the, rh, ne, the, upper, reaches, of, the, main, beyond, schweinfurt, and, the, moselle, in, the, vosges, mountains, captured, during, the, saale, ice, age, from, the, meuse, to, its, watershed, around, 2, 5, million, years, ago, ending, 11, 600, years, ago, the, ice, ages, began, since, approximately, 600, 000, years, ago, six, major, glacial, periods, have, occurred, in, which, sea, level, dropped, as, much, as, 120, m, 390, ft, and, much, of, the, continental, margins, were, exposed, in, the, early, pleistocene, the, rhine, followed, a, course, to, the, northwest, through, the, present, north, sea, during, the, so, called, anglian, glaciation, 450, 000, yr, bp, marine, oxygen, isotope, stage, 12, the, northern, part, of, the, present, north, sea, was, blocked, by, the, ice, and, a, large, lake, developed, that, overflowed, through, the, english, channel, this, caused, the, rhine, s, course, to, be, diverted, through, the, english, channel, since, then, during, glacial, times, the, river, mouth, was, located, offshore, of, brest, france, and, rivers, like, the, river, thames, and, the, seine, became, tributaries, to, the, rhine, during, interglacials, when, sea, level, rose, to, approximately, the, present, level, the, rhine, built, deltas, in, what, is, now, the, netherlands, the, most, recent, glacial, period, ran, from, 74, 000, bp, before, present, until, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, 11, 600, bp, in, northwest, europe, it, saw, two, very, cold, phases, peaking, around, 70, 000, bp, and, around, 29, 000, 24, 000, bp, the, last, phase, slightly, predates, the, global, last, ice, age, maximum, last, glacial, maximum, during, this, time, the, lower, rhine, flowed, roughly, west, through, the, netherlands, and, extended, to, the, southwest, through, the, english, channel, and, finally, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, english, channel, the, irish, channel, and, most, of, the, north, sea, were, dry, land, mainly, because, sea, level, was, approximately, 120, m, 390, ft, lower, than, today, most, of, the, rhine, s, current, course, was, not, under, the, ice, during, the, last, ice, age, although, its, source, must, still, have, been, a, glacier, a, tundra, with, ice, age, flora, and, fauna, stretched, across, middle, europe, from, asia, to, the, atlantic, ocean, such, was, the, case, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, ca, 22, 000, 14, 000, yr, bp, when, ice, sheets, covered, scandinavia, the, baltics, scotland, and, the, alps, but, left, the, space, between, as, open, tundra, loess, wind, blown, topsoil, dust, arose, from, the, south, and, north, sea, plain, settling, on, the, slopes, of, the, alps, urals, and, the, rhine, valley, rendering, the, valleys, facing, the,

of, the, holocene, rhine, meuse, delta, began, 8, 000, years, ago, coeval, absolute, sea, level, rise, and, tectonic, subsidence, have, strongly, influenced, delta, evolution, other, factors, of, importance, to, the, shape, of, the, delta, are, the, local, tectonic, activities, of, the, peel, boundary, fault, the, substrate, and, geomorphology, as, inherited, from, the, last, glacial, period, and, the, coastal, marine, dynamics, such, as, barrier, and, tidal, inlet, formations, since, 3000, yr, bp, years, before, present, human, impact, is, seen, in, the, delta, as, a, result, of, increasing, land, clearance, bronze, age, agriculture, in, the, upland, areas, central, germany, the, sediment, load, of, the, rhine, has, strongly, increased, and, delta, growth, has, sped, up, this, has, caused, increased, flooding, and, sedimentation, ending, peat, formation, in, the, delta, in, the, geologically, recent, past, the, main, process, distributing, sediment, across, the, delta, has, been, the, shifting, of, river, channels, to, new, locations, on, the, floodplain, termed, avulsion, over, the, past, 6000, years, approximately, 80, avulsions, have, occurred, direct, human, impact, in, the, delta, began, with, the, mining, of, peat, for, salt, and, fuel, from, roman, times, onward, this, was, followed, by, embankment, of, the, major, distributaries, and, damming, of, minor, distributaries, which, took, place, in, the, 11, 13th, century, ad, thereafter, canals, were, dug, bends, were, straightened, and, groynes, were, built, to, prevent, the, river, s, channels, from,

to, explore, it, this, view, is, typified, by, res, gestae, divi, augusti, a, long, public, inscription, of, augustus, in, which, he, boasts, of, his, exploits, including, sending, an, expeditionary, fleet, north, of, the, rheinmouth, to, old, saxony, and, jutland, which, he, claimed, no, roman, had, ever, done, before, augustus, ordered, his, stepson, roman, general, drusus, to, establish, 50, military, camps, along, the, rhine, starting, the, germanic, wars, in, 12, bc, at, this, time, the, plain, of, the, lower, rhine, was, the, territory, of, the, ubii, the, first, urban, settlement, on, the, grounds, of, what, is, today, downtown, cologne, along, the, rhine, was, oppidum, ubiorum, which, was, founded, in, 38, bc, by, the, ubii, cologne, became, acknowledged, as, a, city, by, the,

1935, and, after, that, it, would, be, a, demilitarized, zone, with, the, german, army, forbidden, to, enter, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, this, particular, provision, in, general, caused, much, resentment, in, germany, the, allies, troops, left, the, rhineland, in, 1930, and, following, the, rise, to, power, of, adolf, hitler, the, german, army, re, occupied, it, in, 1936, which, proved, an, enormously, popular, action, in, germany, although, the, allies, could, probably, have, prevented, the, reoccupation, britain, and, france, were, not, inclined, to, do, so, a, feature, of, their, policy, of, appeasement, to, hitler, in, world, war, ii, it, was, recognized, that, the, rhine, would, present, a, formidable, natural, obstacle, to, the, invasion, of, germany, by, the, western,
