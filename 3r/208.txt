the, strait, of, magellan, spanish, estrecho, de, magallanes, also, called, the, straits, of, magellan, is, a, navigable, sea, route, in, southern, chile, separating, mainland, south, america, to, the, north, and, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, south, the, strait, is, considered, the, most, important, natural, passage, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, the, strait, is, approximately, 570, km, 310, nmi, 350, mi, long, and, 2, km, 1, 1, nmi, 1, 2, mi, wide, at, its, narrowest, point, in, 1520, the, spanish, expedition, of, the, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, magellan, after, whom, the, strait, is, named, became, the, first, europeans, to, discover, it, magellan, s, original, name, for, the, strait, was, estrecho, de, todos, los, santos, strait, of, all, saints, the, king, of, spain, emperor, charles, v, who, sponsored, the, magellan, elcano, expedition, changed, the, name, to, the, strait, of, magellan, in, honor, of, magellan, the, route, is, difficult, to, navigate, due, to, frequent, narrows, and, unpredictable, winds, and, currents, maritime, piloting, is, now, compulsory, the, strait, is, shorter, and, more, sheltered, than, the, drake, passage, the, often, stormy, open, sea, route, around, cape, horn, which, is, beset, by, frequent, gale, force, winds, and, icebergs, along, with, the, beagle, channel, the, strait, was, one, of, the, few, sea, routes, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, before, the, construction, of, the, panama, canal, land, adjacent, to, the, strait, of, magellan, has, been, inhabited, by, indigenous, americans, for, at, least, 13, 000, years, upon, their, arrival, to, the, region, they, would, have, encountered, native, equines, hippidion, the, large, ground, sloth, mylodon, saber, toothed, cats, smilodon, the, extinct, jaguar, subspecies, panthera, onca, mesembrina, the, bear, arctotherium, the, superficially, camel, like, macrauchenia, the, fox, like, canid, dusicyon, avus, and, lamine, camelids, including, the, extant, vicu, a, and, guanaco, evidence, to, suggest, that, mylodon, hippidion, and, the, lamines, were, hunted, has, been, found, at, some, sites, such, as, cueva, del, medio, historically, identifiable, indigenous, ethnic, groups, around, the, strait, are, the, kaw, sqar, the, tehuelche, the, selk, nam, and, yaghan, people, the, kaw, sqar, lived, on, the, western, part, of, the, strait, s, northern, coast, to, the, east, of, the, kaw, sqar, were, the, tehuelche, whose, territory, extended, to, the, north, in, patagonia, to, the, south, of, the, tehuelche, across, the, strait, lived, the, selk, nam, who, inhabited, the, majority, of, the, eastern, portion, of, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, west, of, the, selk, nam, were, the, yaghan, people, who, inhabited, the, southernmost, part, of, tierra, del, fuego, all, tribes, in, the, area, were, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, the, tehuelche, were, the, only, non, maritime, culture, in, the, area, they, fished, and, gathered, shellfish, along, the, coast, during, the, winter, and, moved, into, the, southern, andes, in, the, summer, to, hunt, the, tribes, of, the, region, saw, little, european, contact, until, the, late, 19th, century, later, european, introduced, diseases, decimated, portions, of, the, indigenous, population, it, is, possible, that, tierra, del, fuego, was, connected, to, the, mainland, in, the, early, holocene, c, 9000, years, bp, much, in, the, same, way, that, riesco, island, was, back, then, a, selk, nam, tradition, recorded, by, the, salesian, missionary, giuseppe, mar, a, beauvoir, relate, that, the, selk, nam, arrived, in, tierra, del, fuego, by, land, and, that, the, selk, nam, were, later, unable, to, return, north, as, the, sea, had, flooded, their, crossing, selk, nam, migration, to, tierra, del, fuego, is, generally, thought, to, have, displaced, a, related, non, seafaring, people, the, haush, that, once, occupied, most, of, the, main, island, the, selk, nam, haush, and, tehuelche, are, generally, thought, to, be, culturally, and, linguistically, related, peoples, physically, distinct, from, the, sea, faring, peoples, according, to, a, selk, nam, myth, the, strait, was, created, along, with, the, beagle, channel, and, fagnano, lake, by, slingshots, falling, on, earth, during, the, fight, of, taiy, n, with, a, witch, who, was, said, to, have, retained, the, waters, and, the, foods, the, first, european, contact, in, this, area, was, evidently, the, voyage, of, ferdinand, magellan, a, report, by, ant, nio, galv, o, in, 1563, that, mentions, early, charts, showing, the, strait, as, dragon, s, tail, has, led, to, speculation, that, there, might, have, been, earlier, contact, but, this, is, generally, discounted, magellan, led, an, expedition, in, the, service, of, the, spanish, king, emperor, charles, v, to, reach, the, spice, islands, his, ships, became, the, first, to, navigate, the, strait, in, 1520, the, five, ships, included, la, trinidad, 110, tons, 55, crew, members, under, the, command, of, magellan, la, san, antonio, 120, tons, 60, crew, members, under, the, command, of, juan, de, cartagena, la, concepci, n, 90, tons, 45, crew,

others, victoria, strait, commemorating, the, first, ship, that, entered, within, seven, years, it, was, being, called, estrecho, de, magallanes, in, honor, of, magellan, the, spanish, empire, and, the, captaincy, general, of, chile, considered, the, strait, the, southern, boundary, of, their, territory, in, the, 1530s, charles, v, divided, south, america, and, whatever, was, to, be, south, of, it, into, a, series, of, grants, to, different, conquistadors, the, strait, of, magellan, and, the, area, south, of, it, went, to, pedro, s, nchez, de, la, hoz, pedro, de, valdivia, the, conquistador, of, chile, managed, to, have, charles, v, extend, his, governorship, all, the, way, to, the, northern, shores, of, the, strait, meanwhile, s, nchez, de, la, hoz, was, executed, in, chile, by, francisco, de, villagra, one, of, valdivia, s, men, the, first, map, of, the, pacific, ocean, maris, pacifici, from, 1589, depicts, the, strait, as, the, only, route, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, contemporaries, differed, in, their, estimation, of, the, strait, s, significance, in, europe, it, was, viewed, by, some, as, an, opportunity, and, a, strategic, location, to, facilitate, long, range, trade, though, antonio, pigafetta, seemed, to, have, understood, his, voyage, through, the, area, as, an, unrepeatable, feat, by, contrast, conquistador, pedro, de, valdivia, in, a, letter, to, charles, v, considered, the, strait, a, threat, through, which, rival, conquistadors, could, arrive, to, challenge, his, claims, in, 1544, valdivia, commissioned, captain, juan, bautista, pastene, to, explore, the, coast, from, valparaiso, to, the, strait, of, magellan, and, installed, his, personal, secretary, juan, de, c, rdenas, in, the, expedition, to, produce, a, written, account, of, the, lands, discovered, in, order, to, solidify, his, claims, before, the, king, although, pastene, s, expedition, reached, only, the, 41st, parallel, south, well, short, of, the, strait, it, discovered, san, pedro, bay, and, the, mouth, of, valdivia, river, where, valdivia, would, later, found, the, city, that, bears, his, name, as, valdivia, consolidated, his, claims, he, mentions, in, a, 1548, letter, to, the, council, of, the, indies, the, possibility, of, establishing, contacts, between, chile, and, seville, through, the, strait, garc, a, jofr, de, loaiza, was, the, second, captain, to, navigate, the, strait, and, the, first, to, discover, that, tierra, del, fuego, was, an, island, valdivia, then, dispatched, francisco, de, ulloa, to, survey, and, explore, the, strait, facilitating, navigation, from, spain, to, chile, in, october, 1553, ulloa, sailed, from, the, city, of, valdivia, in, the, first, expedition, to, enter, the, strait, from, the, west, ulloa, reached, woods, bay, but, faced, with, the, steep, coastline, and, lack, of, provisions, and, fearing, entrapment, in, the, strait, during, the, winter, he, turned, around, returning, to, chilean, ports, in, february, 1554, valdivia, himself, never, actually, reached, the, strait, as, he, was, killed, in, 1553, attempting, to, conquer, araucan, a, about, 1600, km, 994, miles, north, of, the, strait, in, october, 1557, governor, garc, a, hurtado, de, mendoza, sent, another, exploratory, squad, of, 70, men, under, the, command, of, juan, ladrillero, they, were, charged, with, mapping, the, coastline, and, surveying, the, region, s, flora, fauna, and, ethnography, on, august, 16, 1558, ladrillero, arrived, in, the, atlantic, ocean, becoming, the, first, navigator, to, cross, the, strait, of, magellan, in, both, directions, colonization, by, the, spanish, southward, in, chile, halted, after, the, conquest, of, the, chilo, archipelago, in, 1567, the, spanish, are, thought, to, have, lacked, incentives, for, further, conquests, south, the, indigenous, populations, were, sparse, and, did, not, engage, in, the, sedentary, agricultural, life, of, the, spanish, the, harsh, climate, in, the, fjords, and, channels, of, patagonia, may, also, have, deterred, further, expansion, even, in, chilo, the, spanish, encountered, difficulties, having, to, abandon, their, initial, economic, model, based, on, gold, mining, and, hispanic, mediterranean, agriculture, in, 1578, english, navigator, francis, drake, crossed, the, strait, creating, fear, on, the, pacific, coast, that, an, attack, was, imminent, in, order, to, seal, the, passage, the, viceroy, of, peru, francisco, de, toledo, sent, a, squadron, with, two, ships, under, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, they, carefully, explored, the, strait, trying, to, ferret, out, english, invaders, while, surveying, locations, for, future, fortifications, pigafetta, had, described, the, strait, as, a, hospitable, area, with, many, good, ports, cedar, wood, and, abundant, shellfish, and, fish, in, 1584, sarmiento, de, gamboa, founded, two, colonies, in, the, strait, nombre, de, jes, s, and, ciudad, del, rey, don, felipe, the, latter, was, established, on, the, north, shore, of, the, strait, with, 300, settlers, that, winter, it, became, known, as, puerto, del, hambre, or, port, famine, as, most, of, the, settlers, died, of, cold, or, starvation, when, sir, thomas, cavendish, landed, at, the, site, of, rey, don, felipe, in, 1587, he, found, only, ruins, of, the, settlement, the, spanish, failure, to, colonize, the, strait, of, magellan, made, the, chilo, archipelago, key, in, protecting, western, patagonia, from, foreign, intrusions, valdivia, reestablished, in, 1645, and, chilo, acted, as, sentries, and, as, hubs, where, the, spanish, collected, intelligence, from, all, over, patagonia, in, 1599, it, took, five, ships, under, simon, de, cordes, and, his, pilot, william, adams, four, months, to, traverse, the, strait, sebalt, de, weert, returned, before, reaching, the, end, in, 1616, dutch, travelers, including, willem, schouten, and, jacob, le, maire, discovered, cape, horn, and, recognized, the, southern, end, of, tierra, del, fuego, years, later, a, spanish, expedition, commanded, by, brothers, bartolom, and, gonzalo, nodal, verified, this, discovery, making, in, the, way, also, the, first, circumnavigation, of, tierra, del, fuego, after, this, there, would, be, 150, years, before, the, next, ship, from, spain, would, traverse, the, strait, by, 1620, one, hundred, years, after, european, discovery, at, least, 55, ships, had, traversed, the, strait, including, 23, spanish, 17, english, and, 15, dutch, john, narborough, s, 1670, explorations, in, patagonia, caused, the, spanish, to, launch, various, maritime, expeditions, to, western, patagonia, from, 1674, to, 1676, in, the, last, and, largest, one, pascual, de, iriate, led, a, party, to, evangelistas, islets, at, the, western, entrance, to, the, strait, at, evangelistas, sixteen, men, of, the, party, disappeared, on, february, 17, including, the, son, of, pascual, de, iriarte, the, ill, fated, men, had, attempted, to, reach, one, of, the, islets, to, install, a, metal, plaque, indicating, the, king, of, spain, s, ownership, of, the, territory, viceroy, of, peru, baltasar, de, la, cueva, issued, orders, to, the, governments, of, chile, chilo, and, r, o, de, la, plata, to, inquire, about, the, men, who, disappeared, at, evangelistas, islets, however, no, information, about, their, fate, came, forth, and, it, is, presumed, that, the, boat, wrecked, in, the, same, storm, that, forced, the, remaining, party, to, leave, the, area, overall, a, total, of, 16, 17, men, perished, in, it, while, by, 1676, rumours, about, english, bases, in, western, patagonia, had, been, dispelled, that, year, new, rumours, appeared, claiming, that, england, was, preparing, an, expedition, to, settle, the, straits, of, magellan, the, focus, of, spanish, attention, to, repel, tentative, english, settlements, shifted, from, the, pacific, coast, of, patagonia, to, the, straits, of, magellan, and, tierra, del, fuego, such, a, change, from, the, western, archipelagoes, to, the, strait, meant, that, any, english, settlement, could, be, approached, by, spain, by, land, from, the, north, which, was, not, the, case, for, the, islands, in, western, patagonia, in, february, 1696, the, first, french, expedition, under, the, command, of, m, de, gennes, reached, the, strait, of, magellan, the, expedition, is, described, by, the, french, explorer, engineer, and, hydrographer, fran, ois, froger, in, his, a, relation, of, a, voyage, 1699, in, the, 18th, century, further, explorations, were, done, by, english, explorers, john, byron, and, james, cook, the, french, sent, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, and, jules, dumont, d, urville, by, 1770, the, focus, of, a, potential, conflict, between, spain, and, britain, had, shifted, from, the, strait, to, falkland, islands, from, 1826, to, 1830, the, strait, was, explored, and, thoroughly, charted, by, phillip, parker, king, who, commanded, the, british, survey, vessel, hms, adventure, in, consort, with, hms, beagle, king, surveyed, the, complex, coasts, around, the, strait, a, report, on, the, survey, was, presented, at, two, meetings, of, the, geographical, society, of, london, in, 1831, in, connection, to, these, explorations, robert, fitzroy, came, to, suggest, the, establishment, of, a, british, base, in, strait, to, aid, travel, between, the, british, isles, and, australia, the, 1837, french, expedition, of, dumont, d, urville, surveyed, the, area, of, puerto, del, hambre, and, the, navigational, conditions, in, the, strait, of, magellan, in, a, report, the, expedition, recommended, that, a, french, colony, be, established, at, the, strait, to, support, future, traffic, along, the, route, richard, charles, mayne, commanded, hms, nassau, on, a, survey, expedition, to, the, strait, from, 1866, to, 1869, the, naturalist, on, the, voyage, was, robert, oliver, cunningham, charles, darwin, requested, the, lords, of, the, admiralty, to, ask, mayne, to, collect, several, boatloads, of, fossils, of, extinct, quadruped, species, admiral, sulivan, had, previously, discovered, an, astonishingly, rich, accumulation, of, fossil, bones, not, far, from, the, strait, these, remains, apparently, belonged, to, a, more, ancient, period, than, collections, made, by, darwin, on, hms, beagle, and, other, naturalists, and, therefore, were, of, great, scientific, interest, many, of, these, fossils, were, collected, with, the, aid, of, hydrographer, richards, r, n, and, deposited, in, the, british, museum, the, admiralty, compiled, advice, to, mariners, of, the, strait, in, 1871, chile, took, possession, of, the, strait, of, magellan, on, may, 23, 1843, president, manuel, bulnes, ordered, this, expedition, after, consulting, the, chilean, libertador, bernardo, o, higgins, who, feared, an, occupation, by, great, britain, or, france, the, first, chilean, settlement, fuerte, bulnes, was, situated, in, a, forested, zone, on, the, north, side, of, the, strait, and, was, later, abandoned, in, 1848, punta, arenas, was, founded, farther, north, where, the, magellanic, forests, meet, the, patagonian, plains, in, tierra, del, fuego, across, the, strait, from, punta, arenas, the, village, of, porvenir, emerged, during, the, tierra, del, fuego, gold, rush, in, the, late, 19th, century, until, the, opening, of, the, panama, canal, the, town, was, an, important, supply, stop, for, mariners, it, has, been, claimed, that, chile, s, annexation, of, the, area, originated, from, a, fear, of, occupation, by, great, britain, or, france, in, the, boundary, treaty, of, 1881, between, chile, and, argentina, argentina, effectively, recognized, chilean, sovereignty, over, the, strait, of, magellan, argentina, had, previously, claimed, all, of, the, strait, or, at, least, the, eastern, third, of, it, in, the, treaty, of, peace, and, friendship, of, 1984, between, chile, and, argentina, the, conflicts, between, two, countries, were, settled, and, argentina, ratified, the, strait, as, chilean, in, 1840, the, pacific, steam, navigation, company, became, the, first, to, use, steamships, for, commercial, traffic, in, the, strait, until, the, panama, canal, opened, in, 1914, the, strait, of, magellan, was, the, main, route, for, steamships, traveling, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, pacific, it, was, often, considered, safer, than, the, drake, passage, separating, cape, horn, from, antarctica, as, the, drake, passage, is, notorious, for, turbulent, and, unpredictable, weather, and, is, frequented, by, icebergs, and, sea, ice, ships, in, the, strait, protected, by, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, south, and, the, coast, of, continental, south, america, to, the, north, crossed, with, relative, ease, and, punta, arenas, became, a, primary, refueling, port, that, provided, coal, for, steamships, in, transit, the, strait, s, curving, channel, with, widths, varying, between, 1, 9, and, 22, miles, 3, to, 35, km, experiences, unpredictable, winds, and, tidal, currents, leading, sailing, ships, to, prefer, the, drake, passage, where, they, had, more, room, to, maneuver, in, 1900, joshua, slocum, was, the, first, documented, person, to, have, single, handedly, sailed, the, strait, he, experienced, a, 40, day, hiatus, in, the, strait, due, to, storms, and, adverse, weather, while, piloting, the, gaff, rigged, sloop, oyster, boat, spray, in, the, first, solo, global, circumnavigation, he, wrote, about, the, experience, in, sailing, alone, around, the, world, in, 1976, american, open, water, swimmer, lynne, cox, became, the, first, person, to, swim, across, the, strait, almost, 40, years, later, on, january, 17, 2014, hunter, wright, became, the, youngest, person, to, swim, across, the, strait, at, age, 17, in, june, 2004, the, uss, ronald, reagan, was, the, first, nuclear, powered, aircraft, carrier, to, navigate, the, strait, the, strait, is, approximately, 570, km, 310, nmi, 350, mi, long, and, 2, km, 1, 1, nmi, 1, 2, mi, wide, at, its, narrowest, point, carlos, iii, island, west, of, cape, froward, the, northwestern, portion, of, the, strait, is, connected, with, other, sheltered, waterways, via, the, smyth, channel, this, area, is, similar, to, the, inside, passage, of, alaska, south, of, cape, froward, the, principal, shipping, route, follows, the, magdalena, channel, the, climate, is, generally, foggy, and, cold, and, the, course, is, convoluted, with, several, narrow, passages, it, is, several, hundred, miles, shorter, than, the, drake, passage, but, sailing, ships, particularly, clipper, ships, prefer, the, latter, its, major, port, is, punta, arenas, a, transshipment, point, for, chilean, mutton, situated, on, the, brunswick, peninsula, exemplifying, the, difficulty, of, the, passage, it, took, magellan, 38, days, to, complete, the, crossing, the, eastern, opening, is, a, wide, bay, on, the,

which, marks, a, plate, boundary, between, the, south, american, plate, and, the, scotia, plate, this, fault, continues, southward, under, almirantazgo, fjord, and, then, below, fagnano, lake, possibly, new, tourism, industries, could, be, established, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, strait, for, watching, southern, right, whales, as, the, number, of, observations, in, the, area, has, increased, in, recent, years, in, the, more, well, defined, northeastern, course, of, the, strait, various, bays, stand, out, in, its, geography, pecket, bay, spanish, bah, a, pecket, is, a, shallow,
