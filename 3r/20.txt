a, geographic, coordinate, system, gcs, is, a, spherical, or, geodetic, coordinate, system, for, measuring, and, communicating, positions, directly, on, earth, as, latitude, and, longitude, it, is, the, simplest, oldest, and, most, widely, used, of, the, various, spatial, reference, systems, that, are, in, use, and, forms, the, basis, for, most, others, although, latitude, and, longitude, form, a, coordinate, tuple, like, a, cartesian, coordinate, system, the, geographic, coordinate, system, is, not, cartesian, because, the, measurements, are, angles, and, are, not, on, a, planar, surface, a, full, gcs, specification, such, as, those, listed, in, the, epsg, and, iso, 19111, standards, also, includes, a, choice, of, geodetic, datum, including, an, earth, ellipsoid, as, different, datums, will, yield, different, latitude, and, longitude, values, for, the, same, location, the, invention, of, a, geographic, coordinate, system, is, generally, credited, to, eratosthenes, of, cyrene, who, composed, his, now, lost, geography, at, the, library, of, alexandria, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, a, century, later, hipparchus, of, nicaea, improved, on, this, system, by, determining, latitude, from, stellar, measurements, rather, than, solar, altitude, and, determining, longitude, by, timings, of, lunar, eclipses, rather, than, dead, reckoning, in, the, 1st, or, 2nd, century, marinus, of, tyre, compiled, an, extensive, gazetteer, and, mathematically, plotted, world, map, using, coordinates, measured, east, from, a, prime, meridian, at, the, westernmost, known, land, designated, the, fortunate, isles, off, the, coast, of, western, africa, around, the, canary, or, cape, verde, islands, and, measured, north, or, south, of, the, island, of, rhodes, off, asia, minor, ptolemy, credited, him, with, the, full, adoption, of, longitude, and, latitude, rather, than, measuring, latitude, in, terms, of, the, length, of, the, midsummer, day, ptolemy, s, 2nd, century, geography, used, the, same, prime, meridian, but, measured, latitude, from, the, equator, instead, after, their, work, was, translated, into, arabic, in, the, 9th, century, al, khw, rizm, s, book, of, the, description, of, the, earth, corrected, marinus, and, ptolemy, s, errors, regarding, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, sea, causing, medieval, arabic, cartography, to, use, a, prime, meridian, around, 10, east, of, ptolemy, s, line, mathematical, cartography, resumed, in, europe, following, maximus, planudes, recovery, of, ptolemy, s, text, a, little, before, 1300, the, text, was, translated, into, latin, at, florence, by, jacopo, d, angelo, around, 1407, in, 1884, the, united, states, hosted, the, international, meridian, conference, attended, by, representatives, from, twenty, five, nations, twenty, two, of, them, agreed, to, adopt, the, longitude, of, the, royal, observatory, in, greenwich, england, as, the, zero, reference, line, the, dominican, republic, voted, against, the, motion, while, france, and, brazil, abstained, france, adopted, greenwich, mean, time, in, place, of, local, determinations, by, the, paris, observatory, in, 1911, the, latitude, of, a, point, on, earth, s, surface, is, the, angle, between, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, straight, line, that, passes, through, that, point, and, through, or, close, to, the, center, of, the, earth, lines, joining, points, of, the, same, latitude, trace, circles, on, the, surface, of, earth, called, parallels, as, they, are, parallel, to, the, equator, and, to, each, other, the, north, pole, is, 90, n, the, south, pole, is, 90, s, the, 0, parallel, of, latitude, is, designated, the, equator, the, fundamental, plane, of, all, geographic, coordinate, systems, the, equator, divides, the, globe, into, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, longitude, of, a, point, on, earth, s, surface, is, the, angle, east, or, west, of, a, reference, meridian, to, another, meridian, that, passes, through, that, point, all, meridians, are, halves, of, great, ellipses, often, called, great, circles, which, converge, at, the, north, and, south, poles, the, meridian, of, the, british, royal, observatory, in, greenwich, in, southeast, london, england, is, the, international, prime, meridian, although, some, organizations, such, as, the, french, institut, national, de, l, information, g, ographique, et, foresti, re, continue, to, use, other, meridians, for, internal, purposes, the, prime, meridian, determines, the, proper, eastern, and, western, hemispheres, although, maps, often, divide, these, hemispheres, further, west, in, order, to, keep, the, old, world, on, a, single, side, the, antipodal, meridian, of, greenwich, is, both, 180, w, and, 180, e, this, is, not, to, be, conflated, with, the, international, date, line, which, diverges, from, it, in, several, places, for, political, and, convenience, reasons, including, between, far, eastern, russia, and, the, far, western, aleutian, islands, the, combination, of, these, two, components, specifies, the, position, of, any, location, on, the, surface, of, earth, without, consideration, of, altitude, or, depth, the, visual, grid, on, a, map, formed, by, lines, of, latitude, and, longitude, is, known, as, a, graticule, the, origin, zero, point, of, this, system, is, located, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, about, 625, km, 390, mi, south, of, tema, ghana, a, location, often, facetiously, called, null, island, in, order, to, use, the, theoretical, definitions, of, latitude, longitude, and, height, to, precisely, measure, actual, locations, on, the, physical, earth, a, geodetic, datum, must, be, used, a, horizonal, datum, is, used, to, precisely, measure, latitude, and, longitude, while, a, vertical, datum, is, used, to, measure, elevation, or, altitude, both, types, of, datum, bind, a, mathematical, model, of, the, shape, of, the, earth, usually, a, reference, ellipsoid, for, a, horizontal, datum, and, a, more, precise, geoid, for, a, vertical, datum, to, the, earth, traditionally, this, binding, was, created, by, a, network, of, control, points, surveyed, locations, at, which, monuments, are, installed, and, were, only, accurate, for, a, region, of, the, surface, of, the, earth, some, newer, datums, are, bound, to, the, center, of, mass, of, the, earth, this, combination, of, mathematical, model, and, physical, binding, mean, that, anyone, using, the, same, datum, will, obtain, the, same, location, measurement, for, the, same, physical, location, however, two, different, datums, will, usually, yield, different, location, measurements, for, the, same, physical, location, which, may, appear, to, differ, by, as, much, as, several, hundred, meters, this, not, because, the, location, has, moved, but, because, the, reference, system, used, to, measure, it, has, shifted, because, any, spatial, reference, system, or, map, projection, is, ultimately, calculated, from, latitude, and, longitude, it, is, crucial, that, they, clearly, state, the, datum, on, which, they, are, based, for, example, a, utm, coordinate, based, on, wgs84, will, be, different, than, a, utm, coordinate, based, on, nad27, for, the, same, location, converting, coordinates, from, one, datum, to, another, requires, a, datum, transformation, such, as, a, helmert, transformation, although, in, certain, situations, a, simple, translation, may, be, sufficient, datums, may, be, global, meaning, that, they, represent, the, whole, earth, or, they, may, be, local, meaning, that, they, represent, an, ellipsoid, best, fit, to, only, a, portion, of, the, earth, examples, of, global, datums, include, world, geodetic, system, wgs, 84, also, known, as, epsg, 4326, the, default, datum, used, for, the, global, positioning, system, and, the, international, terrestrial, reference, system, and, frame, itrf, used, for, estimating, continental, drift, and, crustal, deformation, the, distance, to, earth, s, center, can, be, used, both, for, very, deep, positions, and, for, positions, in, space, local, datums, chosen, by, a, national, cartographical, organization, include, the, north, american, datum, the, european, ed50, and, the, british, osgb36, given, a, location, the, datum, provides, the, latitude, displaystyle, phi, and, longitude, displaystyle, lambda, in, the, united, kingdom, there, are, three, common, latitude, longitude, and, height, systems, in, use, wgs, 84, differs, at, greenwich, from, the, one, used, on, published, maps, osgb36, by, approximately, 112, m, the, military, system, ed50, used, by, nato, differs, from, about, 120, m, to, 180, m, points, on, the, earth, s, surface, move, relative, to, each, other, due, to, continental, plate, motion, subsidence, and, diurnal, earth, tidal, movement, caused, by, the, moon, and, the, sun, this, daily, movement, can, be, as, much, as, a, meter, continental, movement, can, be, up, to, 10, cm, a, year, or, 10, m, in, a, century, a, weather, system, high, pressure, area, can, cause, a, sinking, of, 5, mm, scandinavia, is, rising, by, 1, cm, a, year, as, a, result, of, the, melting, of, the, ice, sheets, of, the, last, ice, age, but, neighboring, scotland, is, rising, by, only, 0, 2, cm, these, changes, are, insignificant, if, a, local, datum, is, used, but, are, statistically, significant, if, a, global, datum, is, used, on, the, grs, 80, or, wgs, 84, spheroid, at, sea, level, at, the, equator, one, latitudinal, second, measures, 30, 715, m, one, latitudinal, minute, is, 1843, m, and, one, latitudinal, degree, is, 110, 6, km, the, circles, of, longitude, meridians, meet, at, the, geographical, poles, with, the, west, east, width, of, a, second, naturally, decreasing, as, latitude, increases, on, the, equator, at, sea, level, one, longitudinal, second, measures, 30, 92, m, a, longitudinal, minute, is, 1855, m, and, a, longitudinal, degree, is, 111, 3, km, at, 30, a, longitudinal, second, is, 26, 76, m, at, greenwich, 51, 28, 38, n, 19, 22, m, and, at, 60, it, is, 15, 42, m, on, the, wgs, 84, spheroid, the, length, in, meters, of, a, degree, of, latitude, at, latitude, that, is, the, number, of, meters, you, would, have, to, travel, along, a, north, south, line, to, move, 1, degree, in, latitude, when, at, latitude, is, about, the, returned, measure, of, meters, per, degree, latitude, varies, continuously, with, latitude, similarly, the, length, in, meters, of, a, degree, of, longitude, can, be, calculated, as, those, coefficients, can, be, improved, but, as, they, stand, the, distance, they, give, is, correct, within, a, centimeter, the, formulae, both, return, units, of, meters, per, degree, an, alternative, method, to, estimate, the, length, of, a, longitudinal, degree, at, latitude, displaystyle, phi, is, to, assume, a, spherical, earth, to, get, the, width, per, minute, and, second, divide, by, 60, and, 3600, respectively, where, earth, s, average, meridional, radius, m, r, displaystyle, textstyle, m, r, is, 6, 367, 449, m, since, the, earth, is, an, oblate, spheroid, not, spherical, that, result, can, be, off, by, several, tenths, of, a, percent, a, better, approximation, of, a, longitudinal, degree, at, latitude, displaystyle, phi, is, where, earth, s, equatorial, radius, a, displaystyle, a, equals, 6, 378, 137, m, and, tan, b, a, tan, displaystyle, textstyle, tan, beta, frac, b, a, tan, phi, for, the, grs, 80, and, wgs, 84, spheroids, b, a, 0, 99664719, textstyle, tfrac, b, a, 0, 99664719, displaystyle, textstyle, beta, is, known, as, the, reduced, or, parametric, latitude, aside, from, rounding, this, is, the, exact, distance, along, a, parallel, of, latitude, getting, the, distance, along, the, shortest, route, will, be, more, work, but, those, two, distances, are, always, within, 0, 6, m, of, each, other, if, the, two, points, are, one, degree, of, longitude, apart, like, any, series, of, multiple, digit, numbers, latitude, longitude, pairs, can, be, challenging, to, communicate, and, remember, therefore, alternative, schemes, have, been, developed, for, encoding, gcs, coordinates, into, alphanumeric, strings, or, words, these, are, not, distinct, coordinate, systems, only, alternative, methods, for, expressing, latitude, and, longitude, measurements
