poor, air, quality, in, pittsburgh, is, causing, negative, health, effects, in, a, past, study, conducted, between, 2014, and, 2016, researchers, determined, that, children, who, lived, in, areas, close, to, sources, of, pollution, such, as, industrial, sites, experienced, rates, of, asthma, at, almost, 3, times, the, national, average, the, study, also, found, that, 38, of, students, live, in,

located, in, or, very, near, pittsburgh, the, study, also, noted, that, most, of, the, effected, communities, were, minority, communities, this, had, led, some, residents, in, pittsburgh, to, believe, that, the, continuing, effects, of, air, pollution, are, a, case, of, environmental, racism, groups, such, as, women, for, a, healthy, environment, are, working, to, address, ongoing, concerns, surrounding, air, pollution, in, pittsburgh, whe, does, work, such, as, policy, analysis, publishing, reports, and, community, education, in, the, summer, of, 2017, a, crowd, sourced, air, quality, monitoring, application, smell, pgh, was, launched, as, air, quality, is, still, a, concern, of, many, in, the, area, the, app, allows, for, users, to, report, odd, smells, and, informs, local, authorities, the, local, rivers, continue, to, have, pollution, levels, exceeding, epa, limits, this, is, caused, by, frequently, overflowing, untreated, sewage, into, local, waterways, due, to, flood, conditions, and, antiquated, infrastructure, pittsburgh, has, a, combined, sewer, system, where, its, sewage, pipes, contain, both, stormwater, and, wastewater, the, pipes, were, constructed, in, the, early, 1900s, and, the, sewage, treatment, plant, was, built, in, 1959, due, to, insufficient, improvements, over, time, the, city, is, faced, with, public, health, concerns, regarding, its, water, as, little, as, a, tenth, of, an, inch, of, rain, causes, runoffs, from, the, sewage, system, to, drain, into, local, rivers, nine, billion, gallons, of, untreated, waste, and, stormwater, flow, into, rivers, leading, to, health, hazards, and, clean, water, act, violations, the, local, sewage, authority, allegheny, county, sanitary, authority, or, alcosan, is, operating, under, consent, decree, from, the, epa, to, come, up, with, solutions, in, 2017, alcosan, proposed, a, 2, billion, upgrade, to, the, system, which, was, approved, by, the, epa, in, 2019, pittsburgh, water, and, sewer, authority, pwsa, is, the, city, s, agency, required, to, replace, pipes, and, charge, water, rates, they, have, come, under, fire, from, both, city, and, state, authorities, due, to, alleged, mismanagement, in, 2017, mayor, william, peduto, advocated, for, a, restructuring, of, the, pwsa, and, a, partially, privatized, water, authority, governor, wolf, subsequently, assigned, the, pwsa, to, be, under, the, oversight, of, the, public, utilities, commission, puc, pwsa, has, also, been, subject, to, criticism, due, to, findings, released, in, 2016, showing, high, levels, of, lead, in, pittsburgh, s, drinking, water, although, pittsburgh, s, drinking, water, had, been, high, in, lead, levels, and, steadily, rising, for, many, years, many, residents, blame, pwsa, administrative, changes, for, the, spike, in, lead, levels, in, the, years, prior, pwsa, had, hired, veolia, a, paris, based, company, for, consultation, to, help, with, mounting, administrative, difficulties, by, 2015, pwsa, in, consultation, with, veolia, had, laid, off, 23, people, including, halving, the, laboratory, staff, that, was, responsible, for, testing, water, safety, and, quality, simultaneously, pwsa, in, consultation, with, veolia, had, changed, what, chemicals, they, were, using, to, prevent, metal, corrosion, in, 2014, from, soda, ash, to, caustic, soda, without, consulting, with, department, of, environmental, protection, anti, corrosive, chemicals, were, being, used, because, many, of, pittsburgh, s, water, pipes, were, made, of, lead, and, adding, anti, corrosive, chemicals, helped, prevent, lead, from, seeping, into, drinking, water, in, 2016, lead, levels, were, as, high, as, 27, ppb, in, some, cases, the, legal, limit, is, 15, ppb, although, there, is, not, a, safe, amount, of, lead, in, drinking, water, though, lead, levels, had, been, rising, in, previous, years, they, had, not, exceeded, the, legal, limit, in, late, 2015, pwsa, terminated, its, contracted, with, veolia, in, response, to, the, high, lead, levels, pwsa, began, adding, orthophosphate, to, the, water, orthophosphate, is, meant, to, create, a, coating, on, the, inside, of, pipes, creating, a, barrier, to, prevent, lead, from, leaching, into, drinking, water, pwsa, has, also, been, working, to, replace, lead, pipes, and, continuing, to, test, water, for, lead, there, remains, concern, among, residents, over, the, long, term, effects, of, this, lead, particularly, for, children, in, whom, lead, causes, permanent, damage, to, the, brain, and, nervous, system, some, people, also, believe, that, the, high, levels, of, lead, reflect, environmental, racism, as, black, and, hispanic, children, in, pittsburgh, experience, elevated, blood, lead, levels, at, 4, times, the, rate, of, white, children, water, fountains, in, langley, k, 8, school, in, sheraden, were, found, to, have, the, highest, levels, of, lead, of, any, schools, in, the, pittsburgh, area, these, levels, were, about, 11, times, the, legal, limit, some, residents, believe, this, is, due, to, langely, being, a, predominantly, black, school, with, 89, of, the, student, body, being, eligible, for, the, free, lunch, program, at, the, 2010, census, there, were, 305, 704, people, residing, in, pittsburgh, a, decrease, of, 8, 6, since, 2000, 66, 0, of, the, population, was, white, 25, 8, black, or, african,

domain, to, make, space, for, the, construction, of, the, civic, arena, this, civic, arena, ultimately, opened, in, 1961, the, civic, arena, was, built, as, part, of, one, of, pittsburgh, s, revitalization, campaigns, an, auditorium, in, this, space, was, initially, proposed, in, 1947, by, the, regional, planning, association, and, urban, redevelopment, authority, the, idea, of, an, auditorium, with, a, retractable, roof, that, would, house, the, pittsburgh, civic, light, opera, was, more, specifically, proposed, in, 1953, by, the, allegheny, conference, on, community, redevelopment, the, following, year, the, public, auditorium, authority, of, pittsburgh, and, allegheny, county, was, formed, the, lower, hill, district, had, been, approved, by, the, city, planning, commission, in, 1950, partially, as, a, result, of, the, civic, arena, the, whole, hill, district, is, estimated, to, only, have, 12, 000, residents, now, these, governmental, organizations, caused, demographic, changes, through, creating, a, mass, exodus, from, the, lower, hill, district, for, the, construction, of, the, civic, arena, in, the, 1960s, the, urban, redevelopment, authority, attempted, to, redevelop, east, liberty, with, the, goal, of, preserving, its, status, as, a, market, center, penn, center, mall, was, the, result, of, this, effort, in, the, process, of, constructing, this, mall, approximately, 3, 800, people, were, forced, to, relocate, this, proved, to, be, another, case, of, government, intervention, resulting, in, demographic, changes, later, on, in, the, early, 2000s, movement, of, businesses, into, east, liberty, such, as, home, depot, whole, foods, and, google, created, another, demographic, shift, this, era, of, redevelopment, was, led, by, private, developers, who, catered, to, what, one, scholar, described, as, florida, s, creative, class, this, change, continued, to, be, supported, by, the, urban, redevelopment, authority, particularly, by, the, executive, director, rob, stepney, who, said, of, the, redevelopment, we, had, an, inspired, and, shared, vision, when, describing, the, result, of, redevelopment, he, said, east, liberty, went, from, blighted, and, keep, off, the, grass, to, the, definition, of, what, millennials, are, looking, for, the, pittsburgh, government, s, choices, during, redevelopment, and, the, resulting, demographic, changes, have, resulted, in, criticism, and, led, some, residents, to, believe, that, displacement, was, purposeful, in, one, article, published, in, public, source, a, resident, explains, their, belief, that, redevelopment, plans, are, part, of, deconcentration, an, effort, to, spread, out, black, and, low, income, residents, in, order, to, prevent, them, from, being, concentrated, in, one, place, others, worry, that, these, demographic, changes, are, part, of, government, complicity, in, gentrification, gentrification, is, a, process, where, wealthier, residents, move, into, an, area, altering, it, by, increasing, housing, renting, costs, and, changing, the, market, for, businesses, in, the, area, this, displaces, current, residents, who, are,
