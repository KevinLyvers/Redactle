isolation, of, prazeiros, from, ongoing, portuguese, influences, the, prazos, became, african, portuguese, or, african, indian, although, portuguese, influence, gradually, expanded, its, power, was, limited, and, exercised, through, individual, settlers, and, officials, who, were, granted, extensive, autonomy, the, portuguese, were, able, to, wrest, much, of, the, coastal, trade, from, arab, muslims, between, 1500, and, 1700, but, with, the, arab, muslim, seizure, of, portugal, s, key, foothold, at, fort, jesus, on, mombasa, island, now, in, kenya, in, 1698, the, pendulum, began, to,

several, of, them, survived, during, the, 19th, century, other, european, powers, particularly, the, british, british, south, africa, company, and, the, french, madagascar, became, increasingly, involved, in, the, trade, and, politics, of, the, region, around, the, portuguese, east, african, territories, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, portuguese, had, shifted, the, administration, of, much, of, mozambique, to, large, private, companies, like, the, mozambique, company, the, zambezia, company, and, the, niassa, company, controlled, and, financed, mostly, by, british, financiers, such, as, solomon, joel, which, established, railroad, lines, to, their, neighbouring, colonies, south, africa, and, rhodesia, although, slavery, had, been, legally, abolished, in, mozambique, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, chartered, companies, enacted, a, forced, labour, policy, and, supplied, cheap, often, forced, african, labour, to, the, mines, and, plantations, of, the, nearby, british, colonies, and, south, africa, the, zambezia, company, the, most, profitable, chartered, company, took, over, several, smaller, prazeiro, holdings, and, established, military, outposts, to, protect, its, property, the, chartered, companies, built, roads, and, ports, to, bring, their, goods, to, market, including, a, railroad, linking, present, day, zimbabwe, with, the, mozambican, port, of, beira, due, to, their, unsatisfactory, performance, and, the, shift, under, the, corporatist, estado, novo, regime, of, oliveira, salazar, toward, a, stronger, portuguese, control, of, portuguese, empire, s, economy, the, companies, concessions, were, not, renewed, when, they, ran, out, this, was, what, happened, in, 1942, with, the, mozambique, company, which, however, continued, to, operate, in, the, agricultural, and, commercial, sectors, as, a, corporation, and, had, already, happened, in, 1929, with, the, termination, of, the, niassa, company, s, concession, in, 1951, the, portuguese, overseas, colonies, in, africa, were, rebranded, as, overseas, provinces, of, portugal, the, mueda, massacre, of, 16, june, 1960, resulted, in, the, death, of, makonde, protestors, which, provoked, the, struggle, of, independence, from, portuguese, rule, of, mozambique, as, communist, and, anti, colonial, ideologies, spread, out, across, africa, many, clandestine, political, movements, were, established, in, support, of, mozambican, independence, these, movements, claimed, that, since, policies, and, development, plans, were, primarily, designed, by, the, ruling, authorities, for, the, benefit, of, mozambique, s, portuguese, population, little, attention, was, paid, to, mozambique, s, tribal, integration, and, the, development, of, its, native, communities, according, to, the, official, guerrilla, statements, this, affected, a, majority, of, the, indigenous, population, who, suffered, both, state, sponsored, discrimination, and, enormous, social, pressure, as, a, response, to, the, guerrilla, movement, the, portuguese, government, from, the, 1960s, and, principally, the, early, 1970s, initiated, gradual, changes, with, new, socioeconomic, developments, and, egalitarian, policies, the, front, for, the, liberation, of, mozambique, frelimo, initiated, a, guerrilla, campaign, against, portuguese, rule, in, september, 1964, this, conflict, along, with, the, two, others, already, initiated, in, the, other, portuguese, colonies, of, angola, and, portuguese, guinea, became, part, of, the, so, called, portuguese, colonial, war, 1961, 1974, from, a, military, standpoint, the, portuguese, regular, army, maintained, control, of, the, population, centres, while, the, guerrilla, forces, sought, to, undermine, their, influence, in, rural, and, tribal, areas, in, the, north, and, west, as, part, of, their, response, to, frelimo, the, portuguese, government, began, to, pay, more, attention, to, creating, favourable, conditions, for, social, development, and, economic, growth, frelimo, took, control, of, the, territory, after, ten, years, of, sporadic, warfare, as, well, as, portugal, s, own, return, to, democracy, after, the, fall, of, the, authoritarian, estado, novo, regime, in, the, carnation, revolution, of, april, 1974, and, the, failed, coup, of, 25, november, 1975, within, a, year, most, of, the, 250, 000, portuguese, in, mozambique, had, left, some, expelled, by, the, government, of, the, nearly, independent, territory, some, left, the, country, to, avoid, possible, reprisals, from, the, unstable, government, and, mozambique, became, independent, from, portugal, on, 25, june, 1975, a, law, had, been, passed, on, the, initiative, of, the, relatively, unknown, armando, guebuza, of, the, frelimo, party, ordering, the, portuguese, to, leave, the, country, in, 24, hours, with, only, 20, kilograms, 44, pounds, of, luggage, unable, to, salvage, any, of, their, assets, most, of, them, returned, to, portugal, penniless, the, new, government, under, president, samora, machel, established, a, one, party, state, based, on, marxist, principles, it, received, diplomatic, and, some, military, support, from, cuba, and, the, soviet, union, and, proceeded, to, crack, down, on, opposition, starting, shortly, after, independence, the, country, was, plagued, from, 1977, to, 1992, by, a, long, and, violent, civil, war, between, the, opposition, forces, of, anti, communist, mozambican, national, resistance, renamo, rebel, militias, and, the, frelimo, regime, this, conflict, characterised, the, first, decades, of, mozambican, independence, combined, with, sabotage, from, the, neighbouring, states, of, rhodesia, and, south, africa, ineffective, policies, failed, central, planning, and, the, resulting, economic, collapse, this, period, was, also, marked, by, the, exodus, of, portuguese, nationals, and, mozambicans, of, portuguese, heritage, a, collapsed, infrastructure, lack, of, investment, in, productive, assets, and, government, nationalisation, of, privately, owned, industries, as, well, as, widespread, famine, during, most, of, the, civil, war,

included, up, to, 50, of, the, rural, areas, in, several, provinces, and, it, is, reported, that, health, services, of, any, kind, were, isolated, from, assistance, for, years, in, those, areas, the, problem, worsened, when, the, government, cut, back, spending, on, health, care, the, war, was, marked, by, mass, human, rights, violations, from, both, sides, of, the, conflict, with, both, renamo, and, frelimo, contributing, to, the, chaos, through, the, use, of, terror, and, indiscriminate, targeting, of, civilians, the, central, government, executed, tens, of, thousands, of, people, while, trying, to, extend, its, control, throughout, the, country, and, sent, many, people, to, re, education, camps, where, thousands, died, during, the, war, renamo, proposed, a, peace, agreement, based, on, the, secession, of, renamo, controlled, northern, and, western, territories, as, the, independent, republic, of, rombesia, but, frelimo, refused, insisting, on, the, undivided, sovereignty, of,
