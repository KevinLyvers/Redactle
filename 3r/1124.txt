klan, kkk, beginning, in, 1915, by, the, 1920s, the, city, had, become, a, stronghold, of, the, kkk, whose, members, primarily, opposed, catholic, and, jewish, immigrants, but, also, practiced, discrimination, against, black, americans, even, after, the, decline, of, the, kkk, in, the, late, 1920s, the, black, legion, a, secret, vigilante, group, was, active, in, the, detroit, area, in, the, 1930s, one, third, of, its, estimated, 20, 000, to, 30, 000, members, in, michigan, were, based, in, the, city, it, was, defeated, after, numerous, prosecutions, following, the, kidnapping, and, murder, in, 1936, of, charles, poole, a, catholic, organizer, with, the, federal, works, progress, administration, some, 49, men, of, the, black, legion, were, convicted, of, numerous, crimes, with, many, sentenced, to, life, in, prison, for, murder, by, 1940, 80, of, detroit, deeds, contained, restrictive, covenants, prohibiting, african, americans, from, buying, houses, they, could, afford, these, discriminatory, tactics, were, successful, as, a, majority, of, black, people, in, detroit, resorted, to, living, in, all, black, neighborhoods, such, as, black, bottom, and, paradise, valley, at, this, time, white, people, still, made, up, about, 90, 4, of, the, city, s, population, white, residents, attacked, black, homes, breaking, windows, starting, fires, and, detonating, bombs, in, the, 1940s, the, world, s, first, urban, depressed, freeway, ever, built, the, davison, was, constructed, during, world, war, ii, the, government, encouraged, retooling, of, the, american, automobile, industry, in, support, of, the, allied, powers, leading, to, detroit, s, key, role, in, the, american, arsenal, of, democracy, jobs, expanded, so, rapidly, due, to, the, defense, buildup, in, world, war, ii, that, 400, 000, people, migrated, to, the, city, from, 1941, to, 1943, including, 50, 000, blacks, in, the, second, wave, of, the, great, migration, and, 350, 000, whites, many, of, them, from, the, south, whites, including, ethnic, europeans, feared, black, competition, for, jobs, and, scarce, housing, the, federal, government, prohibited, discrimination, in, defense, work, but, when, in, june, 1943, packard, promoted, three, black, people, to, work, next, to, whites, on, its, assembly, lines, 25, 000, white, workers, walked, off, the, job, the, 1943, detroit, race, riot, took, place, in, june, three, weeks, after, the, packard, plant, protest, beginning, with, an, altercation, at, belle, isle, a, total, of, 34, people, were, killed, 25, of, them, black, and, most, at, the, hands, of, the, white, police, force, while, 433, were, wounded, 75, of, them, black, and, property, valued, at, 2, million, worth, 30, 4, million, in, 2020, was, destroyed, rioters, moved, through, the, city, and, young, whites, traveled, across, town, to, attack, more, settled, blacks, in, their, neighborhood, of, paradise, valley, industrial, mergers, in, the, 1950s, especially, in, the, automobile, sector, increased, oligopoly, in, the, american, auto, industry, detroit, manufacturers, such, as, packard, and, hudson, merged, into, other, companies, and, eventually, disappeared, at, its, peak, population, of, 1, 849, 568, in, the, 1950, census, the, city, was, the, fifth, largest, in, the, united, states, in, this, postwar, era, the, auto, industry, continued, to, create, opportunities, for, many, african, americans, from, the, south, who, continued, with, their, great, migration, to, detroit, and, other, northern, and, western, cities, to, escape, the, strict, jim, crow, laws, and, racial, discrimination, policies, of, the, south, postwar, detroit, was, a, prosperous, industrial, center, of, mass, production, the, auto, industry, comprised, about, 60, of, all, industry, in, the, city, allowing, space, for, a, plethora, of, separate, booming, businesses, including, stove, making, brewing, furniture, building, oil, refineries, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and, more, the, expansion, of, jobs, created, unique, opportunities, for, black, americans, who, saw, novel, high, employment, rates, there, was, a, 103, increase, in, the, number, of, blacks, employed, in, postwar, detroit, black, americans, who, immigrated, to, northern, industrial, cities, from, the, south, still, faced, intense, racial, discrimination, in, the, employment, sector, racial, discrimination, kept, the, workforce, and, better, jobs, predominantly, white, while, many, black, detroiters, held, lower, paying, factory, jobs, despite, changes, in, demographics, as, the, city, s, black, population, expanded, detroit, s, police, force, fire, department, and, other, city, jobs, continued, to, be, held, by, predominantly, white, residents, this, created, an, unbalanced, racial, power, dynamic, unequal, opportunities, in, employment, resulted, in, unequal, housing, opportunities, for, the, majority, of, the, black, community, with, overall, lower, incomes, and, facing, the, backlash, of, discriminatory, housing, policies, the, black, community, was, limited, to, lower, cost, lower, quality, housing, in, the, city, the, surge, in, the, black, population, augmented, the, strain, on, housing, scarcity, the, livable, areas, available, to, the, black, community, were, limited, and, as, a, result, families, often, crowded, together, in, unsanitary, unsafe, and, illegal, quarters, such, discrimination, became, increasingly, evident, in, the, policies, of, redlining, implemented, by, banks, and, federal, housing, groups, which, almost, completely, restricted, the, ability, of, blacks, to, improve, their, housing, and, encouraged, white, people, to, guard, the, racial, divide, that, defined, their, neighborhoods, as, a, result, black, people, were, often, denied, bank, loans, to, obtain, better, housing, and, interest, rates, and, rents, were, unfairly, inflated, to, prevent, their, moving, into, white, neighborhoods, white, residents, and, political, leaders, largely, opposed, the, influx, of, black, detroiters, to, white, neighborhoods, believing, that, their, presence, would, lead, to, neighborhood, deterioration, this, perpetuated, a, cyclical, exclusionary, process, that, marginalized, the, agency, of, black, detroiters, by, trapping, them, in, the, unhealthiest, least, safe, areas, of, the, city, as, in, other, major, american, cities, in, the, postwar, era, modernist, planning, ideology, drove, the, construction, of, a, federally, subsidized, extensive, highway, and, freeway, system, around, detroit, and, pent, up, demand, for, new, housing, stimulated, suburbanization, highways, made, commuting, by, car, for, higher, income, residents, easier, however, this, construction, had, negative, implications, for, many, lower, income, urban, residents, highways, were, constructed, through, and, completely, demolished, neighborhoods, of, poor, residents, and, black, communities, who, had, less, political, power, to, oppose, them, the, neighborhoods, were, mostly, low, income, considered, blighted, or, made, up, of, older, housing, where, investment, had, been, lacking, due, to, racial, redlining, so, the, highways, were, presented, as, a, kind, of, urban, renewal, these, neighborhoods, such, as, black, bottom, and, paradise, valley, were, extremely, important, to, the, black, communities, of, detroit, providing, spaces, for, independent, black, businesses, and, social, cultural, organizations, their, destruction, displaced, residents, with, little, consideration, of, the, effects, of, breaking, up, functioning, neighborhoods, and, businesses, in, 1956, detroit, s, last, heavily, used, electric, streetcar, line, which, traveled, along, the, length, of, woodward, avenue, was, removed, and, replaced, with, gas, powered, buses, it, was, the, last, line, of, what, had, once, been, a, 534, mile, network, of, electric, streetcars, in, 1941, at, peak, times, a, streetcar, ran, on, woodward, avenue, every, 60, seconds, all, of, these, changes, in, the, area, s, transportation, system, favored, low, density, auto, oriented, development, rather, than, high, density, urban,

segregation, in, public, schools, the, naacp, also, suggested, a, direct, relationship, between, unfair, housing, practices, and, educational, segregation, as, the, composition, of, students, in, the,

problems, john, mogk, a, professor, of, law, and, an, expert, in, urban, planning, at, wayne, state, university, law, school, in, detroit, says, everybody, thinks, that, it, was, the, riots, that, caused, the, white, families, to, leave, some, people, were, leaving, at, that, time, but, really, it, was, after, milliken, that, you, saw, mass, flight, to, the, suburbs, if, the, case, had, gone, the, other, way, it, is, likely, that, detroit, would, not, have, experienced, the, steep, decline, in, its, tax, base, that, has, occurred, since, then, in, november, 1973, the, city, elected,

forward, with, construction, of, the, elevated, downtown, circulator, portion, of, the, system, which, became, known, as, the, detroit, people, mover, the, gasoline, crises, of, 1973, and, 1979,
