cartography, k, r, t, r, f, i, from, ancient, greek, chart, s, papyrus, sheet, of, paper, map, and, graphein, write, is, the, study, and, practice, of, making, and, using, maps, combining, science, aesthetics, and, technique, cartography, builds, on, the, premise, that, reality, or, an, imagined, reality, can, be, modeled, in, ways, that, communicate, spatial, information, effectively, the, fundamental, objectives, of, traditional, cartography, are, to, modern, cartography, constitutes, many, theoretical, and, practical, foundations, of, geographic, information, systems, gis, and, geographic, information, science, gisc, what, is, the, earliest, known, map, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, both, because, the, term, map, is, not, well, defined, and, because, some, artifacts, that, might, be, maps, might, actually, be, something, else, a, wall, painting, that, might, depict, the, ancient, anatolian, city, of, atalh, y, k, previously, known, as, catal, huyuk, or, atal, h, y, k, has, been, dated, to, the, late, 7th, millennium, bce, among, the, prehistoric, alpine, rock, carvings, of, mount, bego, france, and, valcamonica, italy, dated, to, the, 4th, millennium, bce, geometric, patterns, consisting, of, dotted, rectangles, and, lines, are, widely, interpreted, in, archaeological, literature, as, depicting, cultivated, plots, other, known, maps, of, the, ancient, world, include, the, minoan, house, of, the, admiral, wall, painting, from, c, 1600, bce, showing, a, seaside, community, in, an, oblique, perspective, and, an, engraved, map, of, the, holy, babylonian, city, of, nippur, from, the, kassite, period, 14th, 12th, centuries, bce, the, oldest, surviving, world, maps, are, from, 9th, century, bce, babylonia, one, shows, babylon, on, the, euphrates, surrounded, by, assyria, urartu, and, several, cities, all, in, turn, surrounded, by, a, bitter, river, oceanus, another, depicts, babylon, as, being, north, of, the, center, of, the, world, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, created, maps, from, the, time, of, anaximander, in, the, 6th, century, bce, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, ptolemy, wrote, his, treatise, on, cartography, geographia, this, contained, ptolemy, s, world, map, the, world, then, known, to, western, society, ecumene, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, arab, scholars, were, translating, the, works, of, the, greek, geographers, into, arabic, roads, were, essential, in, the, roman, world, motivating, the, creation, of, maps, called, itinerarium, that, portrayed, the, world, as, experienced, via, the, roads, the, tabula, peutingeriana, is, the, only, surviving, example, in, ancient, china, geographical, literature, dates, to, the, 5th, century, bce, the, oldest, extant, chinese, maps, come, from, the, state, of, qin, dated, back, to, the, 4th, century, bce, during, the, warring, states, period, in, the, book, xin, yi, xiang, fa, yao, published, in, 1092, by, the, chinese, scientist, su, song, a, star, map, on, the, equidistant, cylindrical, projection, although, this, method, of, charting, seems, to, have, existed, in, china, even, before, this, publication, and, scientist, the, greatest, significance, of, the, star, maps, by, su, song, is, that, they, represent, the, oldest, existent, star, maps, in, printed, form, early, forms, of, cartography, of, india, included, depictions, of, the, pole, star, and, surrounding, constellations, these, charts, may, have, been, used, for, navigation, mappae, mundi, maps, of, the, world, are, the, medieval, european, maps, of, the, world, about, 1, 100, of, these, are, known, to, have, survived, of, these, some, 900, are, found, illustrating, manuscripts, and, the, remainder, exist, as, stand, alone, documents, the, arab, geographer, muhammad, al, idrisi, produced, his, medieval, atlas, tabula, rogeriana, book, of, roger, in, 1154, by, combining, the, knowledge, of, africa, the, indian, ocean, europe, and, the, far, east, which, he, learned, through, contemporary, accounts, from, arab, merchants, and, explorers, with, the, information, he, inherited, from, the, classical, geographers, he, was, able, to, write, detailed, descriptions, of, a, multitude, of, countries, along, with, the, substantial, text, he, had, written, he, created, a, world, map, influenced, mostly, by, the, ptolemaic, conception, of, the, world, but, with, significant, influence, from, multiple, arab, geographers, it, remained, the, most, accurate, world, map, for, the, next, three, centuries, the, map, was, divided, into, seven, climatic, zones, with, detailed, descriptions, of, each, zone, as, part, of, this, work, a, smaller, circular, map, depicting, the, south, on, top, and, arabia, in, the, center, was, made, al, idrisi, also, made, an, estimate, of, the, circumference, of, the, world, accurate, to, within, 10, in, the, age, of, discovery, from, the, 15th, century, to, the, 17th, century, european, cartographers, both, copied, earlier, maps, some, of, which, had, been, passed, down, for, centuries, and, drew, their, own, based, on, explorers, observations, and, new, surveying, techniques, the, invention, of, the, magnetic, compass, telescope, and, sextant, enabled, increasing, accuracy, in, 1492, martin, behaim, a, german, cartographer, and, advisor, to, the, king, john, ii, of, portugal, made, the, oldest, extant, globe, of, the, earth, in, 1507, martin, waldseem, ller, produced, a, globular, world, map, and, a, large, 12, panel, world, wall, map, universalis, cosmographia, bearing, the, first, use, of, the, name, america, portuguese, cartographer, diogo, ribero, was, the, author, of, the, first, known, planisphere, with, a, graduated, equator, 1527, italian, cartographer, battista, agnese, produced, at, least, 71, manuscript, atlases, of, sea, charts, johannes, werner, refined, and, promoted, the, werner, projection, this, was, an, equal, area, heart, shaped, world, map, projection, generally, called, a, cordiform, projection, that, was, used, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, over, time, other, iterations, of, this, map, type, arose, most, notable, are, the, sinusoidal, projection, and, the, bonne, projection, the, werner, projection, places, its, standard, parallel, at, the, north, pole, a, sinusoidal, projection, places, its, standard, parallel, at, the, equator, and, the, bonne, projection, is, intermediate, between, the, two, in, 1569, mapmaker, gerardus, mercator, first, published, a, map, based, on, his, mercator, projection, which, uses, equally, spaced, parallel, vertical, lines, of, longitude, and, parallel, latitude, lines, spaced, farther, apart, as, they, get, farther, away, from, the, equator, by, this, construction, courses, of, constant, bearing, are, conveniently, represented, as, straight, lines, for, navigation, the, same, property, limits, its, value, as, a, general, purpose, world, map, because, regions, are, shown, as, increasingly, larger, than, they, actually, are, the, further, from, the, equator, they, are, mercator, is, also, credited, as, the, first, to, use, the, word, atlas, to, describe, a, collection, of, maps, in, the, later, years, of, his, life, mercator, resolved, to, create, his, atlas, a, book, filled, with, many, maps, of, different, regions, of, the, world, as, well, as, a, chronological, history, of, the, world, from, the, earth, s, creation, by, god, until, 1568, he, was, unable, to, complete, it, to, his, satisfaction, before, he, died, still, some, additions, were, made, to, the, atlas, after, his, death, and, new, editions, were, published, after, his, death, in, 1570, the, brabantian, cartographer, abraham, ortelius, strongly, encouraged, by, gillis, hooftman, created, the, first, true, modern, atlas, theatrum, orbis, terrarum, in, a, rare, move, ortelius, credited, mapmakers, who, contributed, to, the, atlas, the, list, of, which, grew, to, 183, individuals, by, 1603, in, the, renaissance, maps, were, used, to, impress, viewers, and, establish, the, owner, s, reputation, as, sophisticated, educated, and, worldly, because, of, this, towards, the, end, of, the, renaissance, maps, were, displayed, with, equal, importance, of, painting, sculptures, and, other, pieces, of, art, in, the, sixteenth, century, maps, were, becoming, increasingly, available, to, consumers, through, the, introduction, of, printmaking, with, about, 10, of, venetian, homes, having, some, sort, of, map, by, the, late, 1500s, there, were, three, main, functions, of, maps, in, the, renaissance, in, medieval, times, written, directions, of, how, to, get, somewhere, were, more, common, than, the, use, of, maps, with, the, renaissance, cartography, began, to, be, seen, as, a, metaphor, for, power, political, leaders, could, lay, claim, to, territories, through, the, use, of, maps, and, this, was, greatly, aided, by, the, religious, and, colonial, expansion, of, europe, the, holy, land, and, other, religious, places, were, the, most, commonly, mapped, during, the, renaissance, in, the, late, 1400s, to, the, late, 1500s, rome, florence, and, venice, dominated, map, making, and, trade, it, started, in, florence, in, the, mid, to, late, 1400s, map, trade, quickly, shifted, to, rome, and, venice, but, then, was, overtaken, by, atlas, makers, in, the, late, 16th, century, map, publishing, in, venice, was, completed, with, humanities, and, book, publishing, in, mind, rather, than, just, informational, use, there, were, two, main, printmaking, technologies, in, the, renaissance, woodcut, and, copper, plate, intaglio, referring, to, the, medium, used, to, transfer, the, image, onto, paper, in, woodcut, the, map, image, is, created, as, a, relief, chiseled, from, medium, grain, hardwood, the, areas, intended, to, be, printed, are, inked, and, pressed, against, the, sheet, being, raised, from, the, rest, of, the, block, the, map, lines, cause, indentations, in, the, paper, that, can, often, be, felt, on, the, back, of, the, map, there, are, advantages, to, using, relief, to, make, maps, for, one, a, printmaker, doesn, t, need, a, press, because, the, maps, could, be, developed, as, rubbings, woodblock, is, durable, enough, to, be, used, many, times, before, defects, appear, existing, printing, presses, can, be, used, to, create, the, prints, rather, than, having, to, create, a, new, one, on, the, other, hand, it, is, hard, to, achieve, fine, detail, with, the, relief, technique, inconsistencies, in, linework, are, more, apparent, in, woodcut, than, in, intaglio, to, improve, quality, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, a, style, of, relief, craftsmanship, developed, using, fine, chisels, to, carve, the, wood, rather, than, the, more, commonly, used, knife, in, intaglio, lines, are, engraved, into, workable, metals, typically, copper, but, sometimes, brass, the, engraver, spreads, a, thin, sheet, of, wax, over, the, metal, plate, and, uses, ink, to, draw, the, details, then, the, engraver, traces, the, lines, with, a, stylus, to, etch, them, into, the, plate, beneath, the, engraver, can, also, use, styli, to, prick, holes, along, the, drawn, lines, trace, along, them, with, colored, chalk, and, then, engrave, the, map, lines, going, in, the, same, direction, are, carved, at, the, same, time, and, then, the, plate, is, turned, to, carve, lines, going, in, a, different, direction, to, print, from, the, finished, plate, ink, is, spread, over, the, metal, surface, and, scraped, off, such, that, it, remains, only, in, the, etched, channels, then, the, plate, is, pressed, forcibly, against, the, paper, so, that, the, ink, in, the, channels, is, transferred, to, the, paper, the, pressing, is, so, forceful, that, it, leaves, a, plate, mark, around, the, border, of, the, map, at, the, edge, of, the, plate, within, which, the, paper, is, depressed, compared, to, the, margins, copper, and, other, metals, were, expensive, at, the, time, so, the, plate, was, often, reused, for, new, maps, or, melted, down, for, other, purposes, whether, woodcut, or, intaglio, the, printed, map, is, hung, out, to, dry, once, dry, it, is, usually, placed, in, another, press, to, flatten, the, paper, any, type, of, paper, that, was, available, at, the, time, could, be, used, to, print, the, map, but, thicker, paper, was, more, durable, both, relief, and, intaglio, were, used, about, equally, by, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, lettering, in, mapmaking, is, important, for, denoting, information, fine, lettering, is, difficult, in, woodcut, where, it, often, turned, out, square, and, blocky, contrary, to, the, stylized, rounded, writing, style, popular, in, italy, at, the, time, to, improve, quality, mapmakers, developed, fine, chisels, to, carve, the, relief, intaglio, lettering, did, not, suffer, the, troubles, of, a, coarse, medium, and, so, was, able, to, express, the, looping, cursive, that, came, to, be, known, as, cancellaresca, there, were, custom, made, reverse, punches, that, were, also, used, in, metal, engraving, alongside, freehand, lettering, the, first, use, of, color, in, map, making, cannot, be, narrowed, down, to, one, reason, there, are, arguments, that, color, started, as, a, way, to, indicate, information, on, the, map, with, aesthetics, coming, second, there, are, also, arguments, that, color, was, first, used, on, maps, for, aesthetics, but, then, evolved, into, conveying, information, either, way, many, maps, of, the, renaissance, left, the, publisher, without, being, colored, a, practice, that, continued, all, the, way, into, the, 1800s, however, most, publishers, accepted, orders, from, their, patrons, to, have, their, maps, or, atlases, colored, if, they, wished, because, all, coloring, was, done, by, hand, the, patron, could, request, simple, cheap, color, or, more, expensive, elaborate, color, even, going, so, far, as, silver, or, gold, gilding, the, simplest, coloring, was, merely, outlines, such, as, of, borders, and, along, rivers, wash, color, meant, painting, regions, with, inks, or, watercolors, limning, meant, adding, silver, and, gold, leaf, to, the, map, to, illuminate, lettering, heraldic, arms, or, other, decorative, elements, the, early, modern, period, saw, the, convergence, of, cartographical, techniques, across, eurasia, and, the, exchange, of, mercantile, mapping, techniques, via, the, indian, ocean, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, the, selden, map, was, created, by, a, chinese, cartographer, historians, have, put, its, date, of, creation, around, 1620, but, there, is, debate, in, this, regard, this, map, s, significance, draws, from, historical, misconceptions, of, east, asian, cartography, the, main, one, being, that, east, asians, did, not, do, cartography, until, europeans, arrived, the, map, s, depiction, of, trading, routes, a, compass, rose, and, scale, bar, points, to, the, culmination, of, many, map, making, techniques, incorporated, into, chinese, mercantile, cartography, in, 1689, representatives, of, the, russian, tsar, and, qing, dynasty, met, near, the, border, town, of, nerchinsk, which, was, near, the, disputed, border, of, the, two, powers, in, eastern, siberia, the, two, parties, with, the, qing, negotiation, party, bringing, jesuits, as, intermediaries, managed, to, work, a, treaty, which, placed, the, amur, river, as, the, border, between, the, eurasian, powers, and, opened, up, trading, relations, between, the, two, this, treaty, s, significance, draws, from, the, interaction, between, the, two, sides, and, the, intermediaries, who, were, drawn, from, a, wide, variety, of, nationalities, maps, of, the, enlightenment, period, practically, universally, used, copper, plate, intaglio, having, abandoned, the, fragile, coarse, woodcut, technology, use, of, map, projections, evolved, with, the, double, hemisphere, being, very, common, and, mercator, s, prestigious, navigational, projection, gradually, making, more, appearances, due, to, the, paucity, of, information, and, the, immense, difficulty, of, surveying, during, the, period, mapmakers, frequently, plagiarized, material, without, giving, credit, to, the, original, cartographer, for, example, a, famous, map, of, north, america, known, as, the, beaver, map, was, published, in, 1715, by, herman, moll, this, map, is, a, close, reproduction, of, a, 1698, work, by, nicolas, de, fer, de, fer, in, turn, had, copied, images, that, were, first, printed, in, books, by, louis, hennepin, published, in, 1697, and, fran, ois, du, creux, in, 1664, by, the, late, 18th, century, mapmakers, often, credited, the, original, publisher, with, something, along, the, lines, of, after, in, the, map, s, title, or, cartouche, in, cartography, technology, has, continually, changed, in, order, to, meet, the, demands, of, new, generations, of, mapmakers, and, map, users, the, first, maps, were, produced, manually, with, brushes, and, parchment, so, they, varied, in, quality, and, were, limited, in, distribution, the, advent, of, magnetic, devices, such, as, the, compass, and, much, later, magnetic, storage, devices, allowed, for, the, creation, of, far, more, accurate, maps, and, the, ability, to, store, and, manipulate, them, digitally, advances, in, mechanical, devices, such, as, the, printing, press, quadrant, and, vernier, allowed, the, mass, production, of, maps, and, the, creation, of, accurate, reproductions, from, more, accurate, data, hartmann, schedel, was, one, of, the, first, cartographers, to, use, the, printing, press, to, make, maps, more, widely, available, optical, technology, such, as, the, telescope, sextant, and, other, devices, that, use, telescopes, allowed, accurate, land, surveys, and, allowed, mapmakers, and, navigators, to, find, their, latitude, by, measuring, angles, to, the, north, star, at, night, or, the, sun, at, noon, advances, in, photochemical, technology, such, as, the, lithographic, and, photochemical, processes, make, possible, maps, with, fine, details, which, do, not, distort, in, shape, and, which, resist, moisture, and, wear, this, also, eliminated, the, need, for, engraving, which, further, speeded, up, map, production, in, the, 20th, century, aerial, photography, satellite, imagery, and, remote, sensing, provided, efficient, precise, methods, for, mapping, physical, features, such, as, coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and, topography, the, united, states, geological, survey, has, devised, multiple, new, map, projections, notably, the, space, oblique, mercator, for, interpreting, satellite, ground, tracks, for, mapping, the, surface, the, use, of, satellites, and, space, telescopes, now, allows, researchers, to, map, other, planets, and, moons, in, outer, space, advances, in, electronic, technology, ushered, in, another, revolution, in, cartography, ready, availability, of, computers, and, peripherals, such, as, monitors, plotters, printers, scanners, remote, and, document, and, analytic, stereo, plotters, along, with, computer, programs, for, visualization, image, processing, spatial, analysis, and, database, management, have, democratized, and, greatly, expanded, the, making, of, maps, the, ability, to, superimpose, spatially, located, variables, onto, existing, maps, has, created, new, uses, for, maps, and, new, industries, to, explore, and, exploit, these, potentials, see, also, digital, raster, graphic, in, the, early, years, of, the, new, millennium, three, key, technological, advances, transformed, cartography, the, removal, of, selective, availability, in, the, global, positioning, system, gps, in, may, 2000, which, improved, locational, accuracy, for, consumer, grade, gps, receivers, to, within, a, few, metres, the, invention, of, openstreetmap, in, 2004, a, global, digital, counter, map, that, allowed, anyone, to, contribute, and, use, new, spatial, data, without, complex, licensing, agreements, and, the, launch, of, google, earth, in, 2005, as, a, development, of, the, virtual, globe, earthviewer, 3d, 2004, which, revolutionised, accessibility, of, accurate, world, maps, as, well, as, access, to, satellite, and, aerial, imagery, these, advances, brought, more, accuracy, to, geographical, and, location, based, data, and, widened, the, range, of, applications, for, cartography, for, example, in, the, development, of, satnav, devices, today, most, commercial, quality, maps, are, made, using, software, of, three, main, types, cad, gis, and, specialized, illustration, software, spatial, information, can, be, stored, in, a, database, from, which, it, can, be, extracted, on, demand, these, tools, lead, to, increasingly, dynamic, interactive, maps, that, can, be, manipulated, digitally, field, rugged, computers, gps, and, laser, rangefinders, make, it, possible, to, create, maps, directly, from, measurements, made, on, site, there, are, technical, and, cultural, aspects, to, producing, maps, in, this, sense, maps, can, sometimes, be, said, to, be, biased, the, study, of, bias, influence, and, agenda, in, making, a, map, is, what, comprise, a, map, s, deconstruction, a, central, tenet, of, deconstructionism, is, that, maps, have, power, other, assertions, are, that, maps, are, inherently, biased, and, that, we, search, for, metaphor, and, rhetoric, in, maps, it, is, claimed, that, the, europeans, promoted, an, epistemological, understanding, of, the, map, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, an, example, of, this, understanding, is, that, reality, can, be, expressed, in, mathematical, terms, that, systematic, observation, and, measurement, offer, the, only, route, to, cartographic, truth, a, common, belief, is, that, science, heads, in, a, direction, of, progress, and, thus, leads, to, more, accurate, representations, of, maps, in, this, belief, european, maps, must, be, superior, to, others, which, necessarily, employed, different, map, making, skills, there, was, a, not, cartography, land, where, lurked, an, army, of, inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and, ideologically, distorted, images, cartographers, developed, a, sense, of, the, other, in, relation, to, nonconforming, maps, depictions, of, africa, are, a, common, target, of, deconstructionism, according, to, deconstructionist, models, cartography, was, used, for, strategic, purposes, associated, with, imperialism, and, as, instruments, and, representations, of, power, during, the, conquest, of, africa, the, depiction, of, africa, and, the, low, latitudes, in, general, on, the, mercator, projection, has, been, interpreted, as, imperialistic, and, as, symbolic, of, subjugation, due, to, the, diminished, proportions, of, those, regions, compared, to, higher, latitudes, where, the, european, powers, were, concentrated, maps, furthered, imperialism, and, colonization, of, africa, in, practical, ways, by, showing, basic, information, like, roads, terrain, natural, resources, settlements, and, communities, through, this, maps, made, european, commerce, in, africa, possible, by, showing, potential, commercial, routes, and, made, natural, resource, extraction, possible, by, depicting, locations, of, resources, such, maps, also, enabled, military, conquests, and, made, them, more, efficient, and, imperial, nations, further, used, them, to, put, their, conquests, on, display, these, same, maps, were, then, used, to, cement, territorial, claims, such, as, at, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, before, 1749, maps, of, the, african, continent, had, african, kingdoms, drawn, with, assumed, or, contrived, boundaries, with, unknown, or, unexplored, areas, having, drawings, of, animals, imaginary, physical, geographic, features, and, descriptive, texts, in, 1748, jean, b, b, d, anville, created, the, first, map, of, the, african, continent, that, had, blank, spaces, to, represent, the, unknown, territory, in, understanding, basic, maps, the, field, of, cartography, can, be, divided, into, two, general, categories, general, cartography, and, thematic, cartography, general, cartography, involves, those, maps, that, are, constructed, for, a, general, audience, and, thus, contain, a, variety, of, features, general, maps, exhibit, many, reference, and, location, systems, and, often, are, produced, in, a, series, for, example, the, 1, 24, 000, scale, topographic, maps, of, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, are, a, standard, as, compared, to, the, 1, 50, 000, scale, canadian, maps, the, government, of, the, uk, produces, the, classic, 1, 50, 000, replacing, the, older, 1, inch, to, 1, mile, ordnance, survey, maps, of, the, entire, uk, and, with, a, range, of, correlated, larger, and, smaller, scale, maps, of, great, detail, many, private, mapping, companies, have, also, produced, thematic, map, series, thematic, cartography, involves, maps, of, specific, geographic, themes, oriented, toward, specific, audiences, a, couple, of, examples, might, be, a, dot, map, showing, corn, production, in, indiana, or, a, shaded, area, map, of, ohio, counties, divided, into, numerical, choropleth, classes, as, the, volume, of, geographic, data, has, exploded, over, the, last, century, thematic, cartography, has, become, increasingly, useful, and, necessary, to, interpret, spatial, cultural, and, social, data, a, third, type, of, map, is, known, as, an, orienteering, or, special, purpose, map, this, type, of, map, falls, somewhere, between, thematic, and, general, maps, they, combine, general, map, elements, with, thematic, attributes, in, order, to, design, a, map, with, a, specific, audience, in, mind, oftentimes, the, type, of, audience, an, orienteering, map, is, made, for, is, in, a, particular, industry, or, occupation, an, example, of, this, kind, of, map, would, be, a, municipal, utility, map, a, topographic, map, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, topographic, description, of, a, place, including, especially, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, use, of, contour, lines, showing, elevation, terrain, or, relief, can, be, shown, in, a, variety, of, ways, see, cartographic, relief, depiction, in, the, present, era, one, of, the, most, widespread, and, advanced, methods, used, to, form, topographic, maps, is, to, use, computer, software, to, generate, digital, elevation, models, which, show, shaded, relief, before, such, software, existed, cartographers, had, to, draw, shaded, relief, by, hand, one, cartographer, who, is, respected, as, a, master, of, hand, drawn, shaded, relief, is, the, swiss, professor, eduard, imhof, whose, efforts, in, hill, shading, were, so, influential, that, his, method, became, used, around, the, world, despite, it, being, so, labor, intensive, a, topological, map, is, a, very, general, type, of, map, the, kind, one, might, sketch, on, a, napkin, it, often, disregards, scale, and, detail, in, the, interest, of, clarity, of, communicating, specific, route, or, relational, information, beck, s, london, underground, map, is, an, iconic, example, although, the, most, widely, used, map, of, the, tube, it, preserves, little, of, reality, it, varies, scale, constantly, and, abruptly, it, straightens, curved, tracks, and, it, contorts, directions, the, only, topography, on, it, is, the, river, thames, letting, the, reader, know, whether, a, station, is, north, or, south, of, the, river, that, and, the, topology, of, station, order, and, interchanges, between, train, lines, are, all, that, is, left, of, the, geographic, space, yet, those, are, all, a, typical, passenger, wishes, to, know, so, the, map, fulfills, its, purpose, modern, technology, including, advances, in, printing, the, advent, of, geographic, information, systems, and, graphics, software, and, the, internet, has, vastly, simplified, the, process, of, map, creation, and, increased, the, palette, of, design, options, available, to, cartographers, this, has, led, to, a, decreased, focus, on, production, skill, and, an, increased, focus, on, quality, design, the, attempt, to, craft, maps, that, are, both, aesthetically, pleasing, and, practically, useful, for, their, intended, purposes, a, map, has, a, purpose, and, an, audience, its, purpose, may, be, as, broad, as, teaching, the, major, physical, and, political, features, of, the, entire, world, or, as, narrow, as, convincing, a, neighbor, to, move, a, fence, the, audience, may, be, as, broad, as, the, general, public, or, as, narrow, as, a, single, person, mapmakers, use, design, principles, to, guide, them, in, constructing, a, map, that, is, effective, for, its, purpose, and, audience, the, cartographic, process, spans, many, stages, starting, from, conceiving, the, need, for, a, map, and, extending, all, the, way, through, its, consumption, by, an, audience, conception, begins, with, a, real, or, imagined, environment, as, the, cartographer, gathers, information, about, the, subject, they, consider, how, that, information, is, structured, and, how, that, structure, should, inform, the, map, s, design, next, the, cartographers, experiment, with, generalization, symbolization, typography, and, other, map, elements, to, find, ways, to, portray, the, information, so, that, the, map, reader, can, interpret, the, map, as, intended, guided, by, these, experiments, the, cartographer, settles, on, a, design, and, creates, the, map, whether, in, physical, or, electronic, form, once, finished, the, map, is, delivered, to, its, audience, the, map, reader, interprets, the, symbols, and, patterns, on, the, map, to, draw, conclusions, and, perhaps, to, take, action, by, the, spatial, perspectives, they, provide, maps, help, shape, how, we, view, the, world, designing, a, map, involves, bringing, together, a, number, of, elements, and, making, a, large, number, of, decisions, the, elements, of, design, fall, into, several, broad, topics, each, of, which, has, its, own, theory, its, own, research, agenda, and, its, own, best, practices, that, said, there, are, synergistic, effects, between, these, elements, meaning, that, the, overall, design, process, is, not, just, working, on, each, element, one, at, a, time, but, an, iterative, feedback, process, of, adjusting, each, to, achieve, the, desired, gestalt, some, maps, contain, deliberate, errors, or, distortions, either, as, propaganda, or, as, a, watermark, to, help, the, copyright, owner, identify, infringement, if, the, error, appears, in, competitors, maps, the, latter, often, come, in, the, form, of, nonexistent, misnamed, or, misspelled, trap, streets, other, names, and, forms, for, this, are, paper, towns, fictitious, entries, and, copyright, easter, eggs, another, motive, for, deliberate, errors, is, cartographic, vandalism, a, mapmaker, wishing, to, leave, their, mark, on, the, work, mount, richard, for, example, was, a, fictitious, peak, on, the, rocky, mountains, continental, divide, that, appeared, on, a, boulder, county, colorado, map, in, the, early, 1970s, it, is, believed, to, be, the, work, of, draftsman, richard, ciacci, the, fiction, was, not, discovered, until, two, years, later, sandy, island, in, new, caledonia, is, an, example, of, a, fictitious, location, that, stubbornly, survives, reappearing, on, new, maps, copied, from, older, maps, while, being, deleted, from, other, new, editions, with, the, emergence, of, the, internet, and, web, mapping, technologies, allow, for, the, creation, and, distribution, of, maps, by, people, without, proper, cartographic, training, are, readily, available, this, has, led, to, maps, that, ignore, cartographic, conventions, and, are, potentially, misleading, professional, and, learned, societies, include, journals, related, to, cartography, as, well, as, gis, gisc, include, mapmaking, history, meanings
