in, astrophysics, an, event, horizon, is, a, boundary, beyond, which, events, cannot, affect, an, observer, wolfgang, rindler, coined, the, term, in, the, 1950s, in, 1784, john, michell, proposed, that, gravity, can, be, strong, enough, in, the, vicinity, of, massive, compact, objects, that, even, light, cannot, escape, at, that, time, the, newtonian, theory, of, gravitation, and, the, so, called, corpuscular, theory, of, light, were, dominant, in, these, theories, if, the, escape, velocity, of, the, gravitational, influence, of, a, massive, object, exceeds, the, speed, of, light, then, light, originating, inside, or, from, it, can, escape, temporarily, but, will, return, in, 1958, david, finkelstein, used, general, relativity, to, introduce, a, stricter, definition, of, a, local, black, hole, event, horizon, as, a, boundary, beyond, which, events, of, any, kind, cannot, affect, an, outside, observer, leading, to, information, and, firewall, paradoxes, encouraging, the, re, examination, of, the, concept, of, local, event, horizons, and, the, notion, of, black, holes, several, theories, were, subsequently, developed, some, with, and, some, without, event, horizons, one, of, the, leading, developers, of, theories, to, describe, black, holes, stephen, hawking, suggested, that, an, apparent, horizon, should, be, used, instead, of, an, event, horizon, saying, gravitational, collapse, produces, apparent, horizons, but, no, event, horizons, he, eventually, concluded, that, the, absence, of, event, horizons, means, that, there, are, no, black, holes, in, the, sense, of, regimes, from, which, light, can, t, escape, to, infinity, any, object, approaching, the, horizon, from, the, observer, s, side, appears, to, slow, down, never, quite, crossing, the, horizon, due, to, gravitational, redshift, its, image, reddens, over, time, as, the, object, moves, closer, to, the, horizon, in, an, expanding, universe, the, speed, of, expansion, reaches, and, even, exceeds, the, speed, of, light, preventing, signals, from, traveling, to, some, regions, a, cosmic, event, horizon, is, a, real, event, horizon, because, it, affects, all, kinds, of, signals, including, gravitational, waves, which, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, more, specific, horizon, types, include, the, related, but, distinct, absolute, and, apparent, horizons, found, around, a, black, hole, other, distinct, types, include, in, cosmology, the, event, horizon, of, the, observable, universe, is, the, largest, comoving, distance, from, which, light, emitted, now, can, ever, reach, the, observer, in, the, future, this, differs, from, the, concept, of, the, particle, horizon, which, represents, the, largest, comoving, distance, from, which, light, emitted, in, the, past, could, reach, the, observer, at, a, given, time, for, events, that, occur, beyond, that, distance, light, has, not, had, enough, time, to, reach, our, location, even, if, it, was, emitted, at, the, time, the, universe, began, the, evolution, of, the, particle, horizon, with, time, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, if, the, expansion, has, certain, characteristics, parts, of, the, universe, will, never, be, observable, no, matter, how, long, the, observer, waits, for, the, light, from, those, regions, to, arrive, the, boundary, beyond, which, events, cannot, ever, be, observed, is, an, event, horizon, and, it, represents, the, maximum, extent, of, the, particle, horizon, the, criterion, for, determining, whether, a, particle, horizon, for, the, universe, exists, is, as, follows, define, a, comoving, distance, d, p, as, in, this, equation, a, is, the, scale, factor, c, is, the, speed, of, light, and, t, 0, is, the, age, of, the, universe, if, d, p, i, e, points, arbitrarily, as, far, away, as, can, be, observed, then, no, event, horizon, exists, if, d, p, a, horizon, is, present, examples, of, cosmological, models, without, an, event, horizon, are, universes, dominated, by, matter, or, by, radiation, an, example, of, a, cosmological, model, with, an, event, horizon, is, a, universe, dominated, by, the, cosmological, constant, a, de, sitter, universe, a, calculation, of, the, speeds, of, the, cosmological, event, and, particle, horizons, was, given, in, a, paper, on, the, flrw, cosmological, model, approximating, the, universe, as, composed, of, non, interacting, constituents, each, one, being, a, perfect, fluid, if, a, particle, is, moving, at, a, constant, velocity, in, a, non, expanding, universe, free, of, gravitational, fields, any, event, that, occurs, in, that, universe, will, eventually, be, observable, by, the, particle, because, the, forward, light, cones, from, these, events, intersect, the, particle, s, world, line, on, the, other, hand, if, the, particle, is, accelerating, in, some, situations, light, cones, from, some, events, never, intersect, the, particle, s, world, line, under, these, conditions, an, apparent, horizon, is, present, in, the, particle, s, accelerating, reference, frame, representing, a, boundary, beyond, which, events, are, unobservable, for, example, this, occurs, with, a, uniformly, accelerated, particle, a, spacetime, diagram, of, this, situation, is, shown, in, the, figure, to, the, right, as, the, particle, accelerates, it, approaches, but, never, reaches, the, speed, of, light, with, respect, to, its, original, reference, frame, on, the, spacetime, diagram, its, path, is, a, hyperbola, which, asymptotically, approaches, a, 45, degree, line, the, path, of, a, light, ray, an, event, whose, light, cone, s, edge, is, this, asymptote, or, is, farther, away, than, this, asymptote, can, never, be, observed, by, the, accelerating, particle, in, the, particle, s, reference, frame, there, is, a, boundary, behind, it, from, which, no, signals, can, escape, an, apparent, horizon, the, distance, to, this, boundary, is, given, by, c, 2, a, displaystyle, c, 2, a, where, a, is, the, constant, proper, acceleration, of, the, particle, while, approximations, of, this, type, of, situation, can, occur, in, the, real, world, in, particle, accelerators, for, example, a, true, event, horizon, is, never, present, as, this, requires, the, particle, to, be, accelerated, indefinitely, requiring, arbitrarily, large, amounts, of, energy, and, an, arbitrarily, large, apparatus, in, the, case, of, a, horizon, perceived, by, a, uniformly, accelerating, observer, in, empty, space, the, horizon, seems, to, remain, a, fixed, distance, from, the, observer, no, matter, how, its, surroundings, move, varying, the, observer, s, acceleration, may, cause, the, horizon, to, appear, to, move, over, time, or, may, prevent, an, event, horizon, from, existing, depending, on, the, acceleration, function, chosen, the, observer, never, touches, the, horizon, and, never, passes, a, location, where, it, appeared, to, be, in, the, case, of, a, horizon, perceived, by, an, occupant, of, a, de, sitter, universe, the, horizon, always, appears, to, be, a, fixed, distance, away, for, a, non, accelerating, observer, it, is, never, contacted, even, by, an, accelerating, observer, one, of, the, best, known, examples, of, an, event, horizon, derives, from, general, relativity, s, description, of, a, black, hole, a, celestial, object, so, dense, that, no, nearby, matter, or, radiation, can, escape, its, gravitational, field, often, this, is, described, as, the, boundary, within, which, the, black, hole, s, escape, velocity, is, greater, than, the, speed, of, light, however, a, more, detailed, description, is, that, within, this, horizon, all, lightlike, paths, paths, that, light, could, take, and, hence, all, paths, in, the, forward, light, cones, of, particles, within, the, horizon, are, warped, so, as, to, fall, farther, into, the, hole, once, a, particle, is, inside, the, horizon, moving, into, the, hole, is, as, inevitable, as, moving, forward, in, time, no, matter, in, what, direction, the, particle, is, travelling, and, can, be, thought, of, as, equivalent, to, doing, so, depending, on, the, spacetime, coordinate, system, used, the, surface, at, the, schwarzschild, radius, acts, as, an, event, horizon, in, a, non, rotating, body, that, fits, inside, this, radius, although, a, rotating, black, hole, operates, slightly, differently, the, schwarzschild, radius, of, an, object, is, proportional, to, its, mass, theoretically, any, amount, of, matter, will, become, a, black, hole, if, compressed, into, a, space, that, fits, within, its, corresponding, schwarzschild, radius, for, the, mass, of, the, sun, this, radius, is, approximately, 3, kilometers, 1, 9, miles, for, earth, it, is, about, 9, millimeters, 0, 35, inches, in, practice, however, neither, earth, nor, the, sun, have, the, necessary, mass, and, therefore, the, necessary, gravitational, force, to, overcome, electron, and, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, the, minimal, mass, required, for, a, star, to, collapse, beyond, these, pressures, is, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, which, is, approximately, three, solar, masses, according, to, the, fundamental, gravitational, collapse, models, an, event, horizon, forms, before, the, singularity, of, a, black, hole, if, all, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, would, gradually, aggregate, towards, the, galactic, center, while, keeping, their, proportionate, distances, from, each, other, they, will, all, fall, within, their, joint, schwarzschild, radius, long, before, they, are, forced, to, collide, up, to, the, collapse, in, the, far, future, observers, in, a, galaxy, surrounded, by, an, event, horizon, would, proceed, with, their, lives, normally, black, hole, event, horizons, are, widely, misunderstood, common, although, erroneous, is, the, notion, that, black, holes, vacuum, up, material, in, their, neighborhood, where, in, fact, they, are, no, more, capable, of, seeking, out, material, to, consume, than, any, other, gravitational, attractor, as, with, any, mass, in, the, universe, matter, must, come, within, its, gravitational, scope, for, the, possibility, to, exist, of, capture, or, consolidation, with, any, other, mass, equally, common, is, the, idea, that, matter, can, be, observed, falling, into, a, black, hole, this, is, not, possible, astronomers, can, detect, only, accretion, disks, around, black, holes, where, material, moves, with, such, speed, that, friction, creates, high, energy, radiation, that, can, be, detected, similarly, some, matter, from, these, accretion, disks, is, forced, out, along, the, axis, of, spin, of, the, black, hole, creating, visible, jets, when, these, streams, interact, with, matter, such, as, interstellar, gas, or, when, they, happen, to, be, aimed, directly, at, earth, furthermore, a, distant, observer, will, never, actually, see, something, reach, the, horizon, instead, while, approaching, the, hole, the, object, will, seem, to, go, ever, more, slowly, while, any, light, it, emits, will, be, further, and, further, redshifted, topologically, the, event, horizon, is, defined, from, the, causal, structure, as, the, past, null, cone, of, future, conformal, timelike, infinity, a, black, hole, event, horizon, is, teleological, in, nature, meaning, that, it, is, determined, by, future, causes, more, precisely, one, would, need, to, know, the, entire, history, of, the, universe, and, all, the, way, into, the, infinite, future, to, determine, the, presence, of, an, event, horizon, which, is, not, possible, for, quasilocal, observers, not, even, in, principle, in, other, words, there, is, no, experiment, and, or, measurement, that, can, be, performed, within, a, finite, size, region, of, spacetime, and, within, a, finite, time, interval, that, answers, the, question, of, whether, or, not, an, event, horizon, exists, because, of, the, purely, theoretical, nature, of, the, event, horizon, the, traveling, object, does, not, necessarily, experience, strange, effects, and, does, in, fact, pass, through, the, calculated, boundary, in, a, finite, amount, of, its, proper, time, a, misconception, concerning, event, horizons, especially, black, hole, event, horizons, is, that, they, represent, an, immutable, surface, that, destroys, objects, that, approach, them, in, practice, all, event, horizons, appear, to, be, some, distance, away, from, any, observer, and, objects, sent, towards, an, event, horizon, never, appear, to, cross, it, from, the, sending, observer, s, point, of, view, as, the, horizon, crossing, event, s, light, cone, never, intersects, the, observer, s, world, line, attempting, to, make, an, object, near, the, horizon, remain, stationary, with, respect, to, an, observer, requires, applying, a, force, whose, magnitude, increases, unboundedly, becoming, infinite, the, closer, it, gets, in, the, case, of, the, horizon, around, a, black, hole, observers, stationary, with, respect, to, a, distant, object, will, all, agree, on, where, the, horizon, is, while, this, seems, to, allow, an, observer, lowered, towards, the, hole, on, a, rope, or, rod, to, contact, the, horizon, in, practice, this, cannot, be, done, the, proper, distance, to, the, horizon, is, finite, so, the, length, of, rope, needed, would, be, finite, as, well, but, if, the, rope, were, lowered, slowly, so, that, each, point, on, the, rope, was, approximately, at, rest, in, schwarzschild, coordinates, the, proper, acceleration, g, force, experienced, by, points, on, the, rope, closer, and, closer, to, the, horizon, would, approach, infinity, so, the, rope, would, be, torn, apart, if, the, rope, is, lowered, quickly, perhaps, even, in, freefall, then, indeed, the, observer, at, the, bottom, of, the, rope, can, touch, and, even, cross, the, event, horizon, but, once, this, happens, it, is, impossible, to, pull, the, bottom, of, rope, back, out, of, the, event, horizon, since, if, the, rope, is, pulled, taut, the, forces, along, the, rope, increase, without, bound, as, they, approach, the, event, horizon, and, at, some, point, the, rope, must, break, furthermore, the, break, must, occur, not, at, the, event, horizon, but, at, a, point, where, the, second, observer, can, observe, it, assuming, that, the, possible, apparent, horizon, is, far, inside, the, event, horizon, or, there, is, none, observers, crossing, a, black, hole, event, horizon, would, not, actually, see, or, feel, anything, special, happen, at, that, moment, in, terms, of, visual, appearance, observers, who, fall, into, the, hole, perceive, the, eventual, apparent, horizon, as, a, black, impermeable, area, enclosing, the, singularity, other, objects, that, had, entered, the, horizon, area, along, the, same, radial, path, but, at, an, earlier, time, would, appear, below, the, observer, as, long, as, they, are, not, entered, inside, the, apparent, horizon, and, they, could, exchange, messages, increasing, tidal, forces, are, also, locally, noticeable, effects, as, a, function, of, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, in, realistic, stellar, black, holes, spaghettification, occurs, early, tidal, forces, tear, materials, apart, well, before, the, event, horizon, however, in, supermassive, black, holes, which, are, found, in, centers, of, galaxies, spaghettification, occurs, inside, the, event, horizon, a, human, astronaut, would, survive, the, fall, through, an, event, horizon, only, in, a, black, hole, with, a, mass, of, approximately, 10, 000, solar, masses, or, greater, a, cosmic, event, horizon, is, commonly, accepted, as, a, real, event, horizon, whereas, the, description, of, a, local, black, hole, event, horizon, given, by, general, relativity, is, found, to, be, incomplete, and, controversial, when, the, conditions, under, which, local, event, horizons, occur, are, modeled, using, a, more, comprehensive, picture, of, the, way, the, universe, works, that, includes, both, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, local, event, horizons, are, expected, to, have, properties, that, are, different, from, those, predicted, using, general, relativity, alone, at, present, it, is, expected, by, the, hawking, radiation, mechanism, that, the, primary, impact, of, quantum, effects, is, for, event, horizons, to, possess, a, temperature, and, so, emit, radiation, for, black, holes, this, manifests, as, hawking, radiation, and, the, larger, question, of, how, the, black, hole, possesses, a, temperature, is, part, of, the, topic, of, black, hole, thermodynamics, for, accelerating, particles, this, manifests, as, the, unruh, effect, which, causes, space, around, the, particle, to, appear, to, be, filled, with, matter, and, radiation, according, to, the, controversial, black, hole, firewall, hypothesis, matter, falling, into, a, black, hole, would, be, burned, to, a, crisp, by, a, high, energy, firewall, at, the, event, horizon, an, alternative, is, provided, by, the, complementarity, principle, according, to, which, in, the, chart, of, the, far, observer, infalling, matter, is, thermalized, at, the, horizon, and, reemitted, as, hawking, radiation, while, in, the, chart, of, an, infalling, observer, matter, continues, undisturbed, through, the, inner, region, and, is, destroyed, at, the, singularity, this, hypothesis, does, not, violate, the, no, cloning, theorem, as, there, is, a, single, copy, of, the, information, according, to, any, given, observer, black, hole, complementarity, is, actually, suggested, by, the, scaling, laws, of, strings, approaching, the, event, horizon, suggesting, that, in, the, schwarzschild, chart, they, stretch, to, cover, the, horizon, and, thermalize, into, a, planck, length, thick, membrane, a, complete, description, of, local, event, horizons, generated, by, gravity, is, expected, to, at, minimum, require, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, one, such, candidate, theory, is, m, theory, another, such, candidate, theory, is, loop, quantum, gravity
