a, month, is, a, unit, of, time, used, with, calendars, that, is, approximately, as, long, as, a, natural, phase, cycle, of, the, moon, the, words, month, and, moon, are, cognates, the, traditional, concept, of, months, arose, with, the, cycle, of, moon, phases, such, lunar, months, lunations, are, synodic, months, and, last, approximately, 29, 53, days, making, for, roughly, 12, 37, such, months, in, one, earth, year, from, excavated, tally, sticks, researchers, have, deduced, that, people, counted, days, in, relation, to, the, moon, s, phases, as, early, as, the, paleolithic, age, synodic, months, based, on, the, moon, s, orbital, period, with, respect, to, the, earth, sun, line, are, still, the, basis, of, many, calendars, today, and, are, used, to, divide, the, year, calendars, that, developed, from, the, roman, calendar, system, such, as, the, internationally, used, gregorian, calendar, divide, the, year, into, 12, months, each, of, which, lasts, between, 28, and, 31, days, the, names, of, the, months, were, anglicized, from, various, latin, names, and, events, important, to, rome, except, for, the, months, 9, 12, which, are, named, after, the, latin, numerals, 7, 10, septem, octo, novem, and, decem, because, they, were, originally, the, seventh, through, tenth, months, in, the, roman, calendar, in, the, modern, gregorian, calendar, the, only, month, with, a, variable, number, of, days, is, the, second, month, february, which, has, 29, days, during, a, leap, year, and, 28, days, otherwise, the, following, types, of, months, are, mainly, of, significance, in, astronomy, most, of, them, but, not, the, distinction, between, sidereal, and, tropical, months, were, first, recognized, in, babylonian, lunar, astronomy, a, synodic, month, is, longer, than, a, sidereal, month, because, the, earth, moon, system, is, orbiting, the, sun, in, the, same, direction, as, the, moon, is, orbiting, the, earth, the, sun, moves, eastward, with, respect, to, the, stars, as, does, the, moon, and, it, takes, about, 2, 2, days, longer, for, the, moon, to, return, to, the, same, apparent, position, with, respect, to, the, sun, an, anomalistic, month, is, longer, than, a, sidereal, month, because, the, perigee, moves, in, the, same, direction, as, the, moon, is, orbiting, the, earth, one, revolution, in, nine, years, therefore, the, moon, takes, a, little, longer, to, return, to, perigee, than, to, return, to, the, same, star, a, draconic, month, is, shorter, than, a, sidereal, month, because, the, nodes, move, in, the, opposite, direction, as, the, moon, is, orbiting, the, earth, one, revolution, in, 18, 6, years, therefore, the, moon, returns, to, the, same, node, slightly, earlier, than, it, returns, to, the, same, star, at, the, simplest, level, most, well, known, lunar, calendars, are, based, on, the, initial, approximation, that, 2, lunations, last, 59, solar, days, a, 30, day, full, month, followed, by, a, 29, day, hollow, month, but, this, is, only, roughly, accurate, and, regularly, needs, intercalation, correction, by, a, leap, day, additionally, the, synodic, month, does, not, fit, easily, into, the, solar, or, tropical, year, which, makes, accurate, rule, based, lunisolar, calendars, that, combine, the, two, cycles, complicated, the, most, common, solution, to, this, problem, is, the, metonic, cycle, which, takes, advantage, of, the, fact, that, 235, lunations, are, approximately, 19, tropical, years, which, add, up, to, not, quite, 6, 940, days, 12, years, have, 12, lunar, months, and, 7, years, are, 13, lunar, months, long, however, a, metonic, calendar, based, year, will, drift, against, the, seasons, by, about, one, day, every, 2, centuries, metonic, calendars, include, the, calendar, used, in, the, antikythera, mechanism, about, 21, centuries, ago, and, the, hebrew, calendar, alternatively, in, a, pure, lunar, calendar, years, are, defined, as, having, always, 12, lunations, so, a, year, is, 354, or, 355, days, long, the, islamic, calendar, is, the, prime, example, consequently, an, islamic, year, is, about, 11, days, shorter, than, a, solar, year, and, cycles, through, the, seasons, in, about, 33, solar, 34, lunar, years, the, islamic, new, year, has, a, different, gregorian, calendar, date, in, each, solar, year, purely, solar, calendars, often, have, months, which, no, longer, relate, to, the, phase, of, the, moon, but, are, based, only, on, the, motion, of, the, sun, relative, to, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, or, are, purely, conventional, like, in, the, widely, used, gregorian, calendar, the, complexity, required, in, an, accurate, lunisolar, calendar, may, explain, why, solar, calendars, have, generally, replaced, lunisolar, and, lunar, calendars, for, civil, use, in, most, societies, the, hellenic, calendars, the, hebrew, lunisolar, calendar, and, the, islamic, lunar, calendar, started, the, month, with, the, first, appearance, of, the, thin, crescent, of, the, new, moon, however, the, motion, of, the, moon, in, its, orbit, is, very, complicated, and, its, period, is, not, constant, the, date, and, time, of, this, actual, observation, depends, on, the, exact, geographical, longitude, as, well, as, latitude, atmospheric, conditions, the, visual, acuity, of, the, observers, etc, therefore, the, beginning, and, lengths, of, months, defined, by, observation, cannot, be, accurately, predicted, while, some, like, orthodox, islam, and, the, jewish, karaites, still, rely, on, actual, moon, observations, reliance, on, astronomical, calculations, and, tabular, methods, is, increasingly, common, in, practice, there, are, 12, months, and, an, additional, leap, year, month, in, the, ahom, sexagenary, calendar, known, as, lak, ni, the, first, month, is, duin, shing, the, roman, calendar, was, reformed, several, times, the, last, three, enduring, reforms, during, historical, times, the, last, three, reformed, roman, calendars, are, called, the, julian, augustan, and, gregorian, all, had, the, same, number, of, days, in, their, months, despite, other, attempts, the, names, of, the, months, after, the, augustan, calendar, reform, have, persisted, and, the, number, of, days, in, each, month, except, february, have, remained, constant, since, before, the, julian, reform, the, gregorian, calendar, like, the, roman, calendars, before, it, has, twelve, months, whose, anglicized, names, are, the, famous, mnemonic, thirty, days, hath, september, is, a, common, way, of, teaching, the, lengths, of, the, months, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, knuckles, of, the, four, fingers, of, one, s, hand, and, the, spaces, between, them, can, be, used, to, remember, the, lengths, of, the, months, by, making, a, fist, each, month, will, be, listed, as, one, proceeds, across, the, hand, all, months, landing, on, a, knuckle, are, 31, days, long, and, those, landing, between, them, are, 30, days, long, with, variable, february, being, the, remembered, exception, when, the, knuckle, of, the, index, finger, is, reached, july, go, over, to, the, first, knuckle, on, the, other, fist, held, next, to, the, first, or, go, back, to, the, first, knuckle, and, continue, with, august, this, physical, mnemonic, has, been, taught, to, primary, school, students, for, many, decades, if, not, centuries, this, cyclical, pattern, of, month, lengths, matches, the, musical, keyboard, alternation, of, wide, white, keys, 31, days, and, narrow, black, keys, 30, days, the, note, f, corresponds, to, january, the, note, f, corresponds, to, february, the, exceptional, 28, 29, day, month, and, so, on, the, mean, month, length, in, the, gregorian, calendar, is, 30, 436875, days, any, five, consecutive, months, that, do, not, include, february, contain, 153, days, months, in, the, pre, julian, roman, calendar, included, the, romans, divided, their, months, into, three, parts, which, they, called, the, calends, the, nones, and, the, ides, their, system, is, somewhat, intricate, the, ides, occur, on, the, thirteenth, day, in, eight, of, the, months, but, in, march, may, july, and, october, they, occur, on, the, fifteenth, the, nones, always, occur, 8, days, one, roman, week, before, the, ides, i, e, on, the, fifth, or, the, seventh, the, calends, are, always, the, first, day, of, the, month, and, before, julius, caesar, s, reform, fell, sixteen, days, two, roman, weeks, after, the, ides, except, the, ides, of, february, and, the, intercalary, month, within, a, month, the, following, dates, fall, on, the, same, day, of, the, week, some, months, have, the, same, date, weekday, structure, in, a, non, leap, year, in, a, leap, year, the, hebrew, calendar, has, 12, or, 13, months, adar, 1, is, only, added, 7, times, in, 19, years, in, ordinary, years, adar, 2, is, simply, called, adar, there, are, also, twelve, months, in, the, islamic, calendar, they, are, named, as, follows,

regular, and, 5, in, leap, years, the, months, are, named, after, the, attributes, of, god, days, of, the, year, begin, and, end, at, sundown, the, iranian, persian, calendar, currently, used, in, iran, also, has, 12, months, the, persian, names, are, included, in, the, parentheses, it, begins, on, the, northern, spring, equinox, the, bengali, calendar, used, in, bangladesh, follows, solar, months, and, it, has, six, seasons, the, months, and, seasons, in, the, calendar, are, the, months, in, the, nanakshahi, calendar, are, different, from, the, hindu, calendar, the, khmer, calendar, consists, of, both, a, lunar, calendar, and, a, solar, calendar, the, solar, is, used, more, commonly, than, the, lunar, calendar, the, khmer, lunar, calendar, most, often, contains, 12, months, however, the, eighth, month, is, repeated, as, a, leap, month, every, two, or, three, years, making, 13, months, instead, of, 12, each, lunar, month, has, 29, or, 30, days, the, year, normally, has, then, 354, or, 384, days, when, an, intercalary, month, is, added, but, the, calendar, follows, the, rules, of, the, gregorian, calendar, to, determine, leap, years, and, add, a, lead, day, to, one, month, so, the, khmer, lunar, year, may, have, a, total, of, 354, 355, 384, or, 385, days, the, tongan, calendar, is, based, on, the, cycles, of, the, moon, around, the, earth, in, one, year, the, months, are, pingelapese, a, language, from, micronesia, also, uses, a, lunar, calendar, there, are, 12, months, associated, with, their, calendar, the, moon, first, appears, in, march, they, name, this, month, kahlek, this, system, has, been, used, for, hundreds, of, years, and, throughout, many, generations, this, calendar, is, cyclical, and, relies, on, the, position, and, shape, of, the, moon, the, sinhalese, calendar, is, the, buddhist, calendar, in, sri, lanka, with, sinhala, names, each, full, moon, poya, day, marks, the, start, of, a, buddhist, lunar, month, the, first, month, is, bak, the, old, icelandic, calendar, is, not, in, official, use, anymore, but, some, icelandic, holidays, and, annual, feasts, are, still, calculated, from, it, it, has, 12, months, broken, down, into, two, groups, of, six, often, termed, winter, months, and, summer, months, the, calendar, is, peculiar, in, that, the, months, always, start, on, the, same, weekday, rather, than, on, the, same, date, hence, orri, always, starts, on, a, friday, sometime, between, january, 22, and, january, 28, old, style, january, 9, to, january, 15, g, a, always, starts, on, a, sunday, between, february, 21, and, february, 27, old, style, february, 8, to, february, 14, note, new, year, in, ancient, georgia, started, from, september, like, the, old, norse, calendar, the, anglo, saxons, had, their, own, calendar, before, they, were, christianized, which, reflected, native, traditions, and, deities, these, months, were, attested, by, bede, in, his, works, on, chronology, and, the, reckoning, of, time, written, in, the, 8th, century, his, old, english, month, names, are, probably, written, as, pronounced, in, bede, s, native, northumbrian, dialect, the, months, were, named, after, the, moon, the, new, moon, marking, the, end, of, an, old, month, and, start, of, a, new, month, the, full, moon, occurring, in, the, middle, of, the, month, after, which, the, whole, month, took, its, name, when, an, intercalary, month, was, needed, a, third, litha, month, was, inserted, in, mid, summer, the, coligny, calendar, gaulish, celtic, is, an, iron, age, metonic, lunisolar, calendar, with, 12, lunar, months, of, either, 29, or, 30, days, the, lunar, month, is, calculated, to, a, precision, of, within, 24, hours, of, the, lunar, phase, achieved, by, a, particular, arrangement, of, months, and, the, month, of, equos, having, a, variable, length, of, 29, or, 30, days, to, adjust, for, any, lunar, slippage, this, setup, means, the, calendar, could, stay, precisely, aligned, to, its, lunar, phase, indefinitely, the, lunar, month, is, divided, into, two, halves, the, first, of, 15, days, and, the, second, of, 14, or, 15, days, the, month, is, calculated, to, start, at, the, first, quarter, moon, with, the, full, moon, at, the, centre, of, the, first, half, month, and, the, dark, moon, at, the, centre, of, the, second, half, month, the, calendar, does, not, rely, on, unreliable, visual, sightings, an, intercalary, lunar, month, is, inserted, before, every, 30, lunar, months, to, keep, in, sync, with, the, solar, year, every, 276, years, this, adds, one, day, to, the, solar, point, so, if, for, example, the, calendar, was, 1, 000, years, old, it, would, only, have, slipped, by, less, than, 4, days, against, the, solar, year, nagyszombati, kalend, rium, in, latin, calendarium, tyrnaviense, from, 1579, historically, hungary, used, a, 12, month, calendar, that, appears, to, have, been, zodiacal, in, nature, but, eventually, came, to, correspond, to, the, gregorian, months, as, shown, below, the, ancient, civil, egyptian, calendar, had, a, year, that, was, 365, days, long, and, was, divided, into, 12, months, of, 30, days, each, plus, 5, extra, days, epagomenes, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, months, were, divided, into, 3, weeks, of, ten, days, each, because, the, ancient, egyptian, year, was, almost, a, quarter, of, a, day, shorter, than, the, solar, year, and, stellar, events, wandered, through, the, calendar, it, is, referred, to, as, annus, vagus, or, wandering, year, the, nisga, a, calendar, coincides, with, the, gregorian, calendar, with, each, month, referring, to, the, type, of, harvesting, that, is, done, during, the, month, this, calendar, was, proposed, during, the, french, revolution, and, used, by, the, french, government, for, about, twelve, years, from, late, 1793, there, were, twelve, months, of, 30, days, each, grouped, into, three, ten, day, weeks, called, d, cades, the, five, or, six, extra, days, needed, to, approximate, the, tropical, year, were, placed, after, the, months, at, the, end, of, each, year, a, period, of, four, years, ending, on, a, leap, day, was, to, be, called, a, franciade, it, began, at, the, autumn, equinox, ojibwe, month, names, are, based, on, the, key, feature, of, the, month, consequently, months, between, various, regions, have, different, names, based, on, the, key, feature, of, each, month, in, their, particular, region, in, the, eastern, ojibwe, this, can, be, seen, in, when, the, sucker, makes, its, run, which, allows, the, ojibwe, to, fish, for, them, additionally, rhodes, also, informs, of, not, only, the, variability, in, the, month, names, but, how, in, eastern, ojibwe, these, names, were, originally, applied, to, the, lunar, months, the, ojibwe, originally, used, which, was, a, lunisolar, calendar, fixed, by, the, date, of, akiinaaniwan, typically, december, 27, that, marks, when, sunrise, is, the, latest, in, the, northern, hemisphere
