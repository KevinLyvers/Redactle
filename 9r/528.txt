chemistry, an, alkyne, is, an, unsaturated, hydrocarbon, containing, at, least, one, carbon, carbon, triple, bond, the, simplest, acyclic, alkynes, with, only, one, triple, bond, and, no, other, functional, groups, form, a, homologous, series, with, the, general, chemical, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, 2, alkynes, are, traditionally, known, as, acetylenes, although, the, name, acetylene, also, refers, specifically, to, c, 2, h, 2, known, formally, as, ethyne, using, iupac, nomenclature, like, other, hydrocarbons, alkynes, are, generally, hydrophobic, in, acetylene, the, h, c, c, bond, angles, are, 180, by, virtue, of, this, bond, angle, alkynes, are, rod, like, correspondingly, cyclic, alkynes, are, rare, benzyne, cannot, be, isolated, the, c, c, bond, distance, of, 118, picometers, for, c, 2, h, 2, is, much, shorter, than, the, c, c, distance, in, alkenes, 132, pm, for, c, 2, h, 4, or, the, c, c, bond, in, alkanes, 153, pm, the, triple, bond, is, very, strong, with, a, bond, strength, of, 839, kj, mol, the, sigma, bond, contributes, 369, kj, mol, the, first, pi, bond, contributes, 268, kj, mol, and, the, second, pi, bond, 202, kj, mol, bonding, is, usually, discussed, in, the, context, of, molecular, orbital, theory, which, recognizes, the, triple, bond, as, arising, from, overlap, of, s, and, p, orbitals, in, the, language, of, valence, bond, theory, the, carbon, atoms, in, an, alkyne, bond, are, sp, hybridized, they, each, have, two, unhybridized, p, orbitals, and, two, sp, hybrid, orbitals, overlap, of, an, sp, orbital, from, each, atom, forms, one, sp, sp, sigma, bond, each, p, orbital, on, one, atom, overlaps, one, on, the, other, atom, forming, two, pi, bonds, giving, a, total, of, three, bonds, the, remaining, sp, orbital, on, each, atom, can, form, a, sigma, bond, to, another, atom, for, example, to, hydrogen, atoms, in, the, parent, acetylene, the, two, sp, orbitals, project, on, opposite, sides, of, the, carbon, atom, internal, alkynes, feature, carbon, substituents, on, each, acetylenic, carbon, symmetrical, examples, include, diphenylacetylene, and, 3, hexyne, they, may, also, be, asymmetrical, such, as, in, 2, pentyne, terminal, alkynes, have, the, formula, rc, 2, h, an, example, is, methylacetylene, propyne, using, iupac, nomenclature, they, are, often, prepared, by, alkylation, of, monosodium, acetylide, terminal, alkynes, like, acetylene, itself, are, mildly, acidic, with, p, k, a, values, of, around, 25, they, are, far, more, acidic, than, alkenes, and, alkanes, which, have, p, k, a, values, of, around, 40, and, 50, respectively, the, acidic, hydrogen, on, terminal, alkynes, can, be, replaced, by, a, variety, of, groups, resulting, in, halo, silyl, and, alkoxoalkynes, the, carbanions, generated, by, deprotonation, of, terminal, alkynes, are, called, acetylides, in, systematic, chemical, nomenclature, alkynes, are, named, with, the, greek, prefix, system, without, any, additional, letters, examples, include, ethyne, or, octyne, in, parent, chains, with, four, or, more, carbons, it, is, necessary, to, say, where, the, triple, bond, is, located, for, octyne, one, can, either, write, 3, octyne, or, oct, 3, yne, when, the, bond, starts, at, the, third, carbon, the, lowest, number, possible, is, given, to, the, triple, bond, when, no, superior, functional, groups, are, present, the, parent, chain, must, include, the, triple, bond, even, if, it, is, not, the, longest, possible, carbon, chain, in, the, molecule, ethyne, is, commonly, called, by, its, trivial, name, acetylene, in, chemistry, the, suffix, yne, is, used, to, denote, the, presence, of, a, triple, bond, in, organic, chemistry, the, suffix, often, follows, iupac, nomenclature, however, inorganic, compounds, featuring, unsaturation, in, the, form, of, triple, bonds, may, be, denoted, by, substitutive, nomenclature, with, the, same, methods, used, with, alkynes, i, e, the, name, of, the, corresponding, saturated, compound, is, modified, by, replacing, the, ane, ending, with, yne, diyne, is, used, when, there, are, two, triple, bonds, and, so, on, the, position, of, unsaturation, is, indicated, by, a, numerical, locant, immediately, preceding, the, yne, suffix, or, locants, in, the, case, of, multiple, triple, bonds, locants, are, chosen, so, that, the, numbers, are, low, as, possible, yne, is, also, used, as, a, suffix, to, name, substituent, groups, that, are, triply, bound, to, the, parent, compound, sometimes, a, number, between, hyphens, is, inserted, before, it, to, state, which, atoms, the, triple, bond, is, between, this, suffix, arose, as, a, collapsed, form, of, the, end, of, the, word, acetylene, the, final, e, disappears, if, it, is, followed, by, another, suffix, that, starts, with, a, vowel, alkynes, having, four, or, more, carbon, atoms, can, form, different, structural, isomers, by, having, the, triple, bond, in, different, positions, or, having, some, of, the, carbon, atoms, be, substituents, rather, than, part, of, the, parent, chain, other, non, alkyne, structural, isomers, are, also, possible, commercially, the, dominant, alkyne, is, acetylene, itself, which, is, used, as, a, fuel, and, a, precursor, to, other, compounds, e, g, acrylates, hundreds, of, millions, of, kilograms, are, produced, annually, by, partial, oxidation, of, natural, gas, propyne, also, industrially, useful, is, also, prepared, by, thermal, cracking, of, hydrocarbons, alkynes, are, prepared, from, 1, 1, and, 1, 2, dihaloalkanes, by, double, dehydrohalogenation, the, reaction, provides, a, means, to, generate, alkynes, from, alkenes, which, are, first, halogenated, and, then, dehydrohalogenated, for, example, phenylacetylene, can, be, generated, from, styrene, by, bromination, followed, by, treatment, of, the, resulting, of, styrene, dibromide, with, sodium, amide, in, ammonia, via, the, fritsch, buttenberg, wiechell, rearrangement, alkynes, are, prepared, from, vinyl, bromides, alkynes, can, be, prepared, from, aldehydes, using, the, corey, fuchs, reaction, and, from, aldehydes, or, ketones, by, the, seyferth, gilbert, homologation, vinyl, halides, are, susceptible, to, dehydrohalogenation, featuring, a, reactive, functional, group, alkynes, participate, in, many, organic, reactions, such, use, was, pioneered, by, ralph, raphael, who, in, 1955, wrote, the, first, book, describing, their, versatility, as, intermediates, in, synthesis, being, more, unsaturated, than, alkenes, alkynes, characteristically, undergo, reactions, that, show, that, they, are, doubly, unsaturated, alkynes, are, capable, of, adding, two, equivalents, of, h, 2, whereas, an, alkene, adds, only, one, equivalent, depending, on, catalysts, and, conditions, alkynes, add, one, or, two, equivalents, of, hydrogen, partial, hydrogenation, stopping, after, the, addition, of, only, one, equivalent, to, give, the, alkene, is, usually, more, desirable, since, alkanes, are, less, useful, the, largest, scale, application, of, this, technology, is, the, conversion, of, acetylene, to, ethylene, in, refineries, the, steam, cracking, of, alkanes, yields, a, few, percent, acetylene, which, is, selectively, hydrogenated, in, the, presence, of, a, palladium, silver, catalyst, for, more, complex, alkynes, the, lindlar, catalyst, is, widely, recommended, to, avoid, formation, of, the, alkane, for, example, in, the, conversion, of, phenylacetylene, to, styrene, similarly, halogenation, of, alkynes, gives, the, alkene, dihalides, or, alkyl, tetrahalides, the, addition, of, one, equivalent, of, h, 2, to, internal, alkynes, gives, cis, alkenes, alkynes, characteristically, are, capable, of, adding, two, equivalents, of, halogens, and, hydrogen, halides, the, addition, of, nonpolar, e, h, bonds, across, c, c, is, general, for, silanes, boranes, and, related, hydrides, the, hydroboration, of, alkynes, gives, vinylic, boranes, which, oxidize, to, the, corresponding, aldehyde, or, ketone, in, the, thiol, yne, reaction, the, substrate, is, a, thiol, addition, of, hydrogen, halides, has, long, been, of, interest, in, the, presence, of, mercuric, chloride, as, a, catalyst, acetylene, and, hydrogen, chloride, react, to, give, vinyl, chloride, while, this, method, has, been, abandoned, in, the, west, it, remains, the, main, production, method, in, china, the, hydration, reaction, of, acetylene, gives, acetaldehyde, the, reaction, proceeds, by, formation, of, vinyl, alcohol, which, tautomerizes, to, form, the, aldehyde, this, reaction, was, once, a, major, industrial, process, but, it, has, been, displaced, by, the, wacker, process, this, reaction, occurs, in, nature, the, catalyst, being, acetylene, hydratase, hydration, of, phenylacetylene, gives, acetophenone, ph, 3, p, auch, 3, catalyzes, hydration, of, 1, 8, nonadiyne, to, 2, 8, nonanedione, terminal, alkyl, alkynes, exhibit, tautomerism, propyne, exists, in, equilibrium, with, propadiene, alkynes, undergo, diverse, cycloaddition, reactions, the, diels, alder, reaction, with, 1, 3, dienes, gives, 1, 4, cyclohexadienes, this, general, reaction, has, been, extensively, developed, electrophilic, alkynes, are, especially, effective, dienophiles, the, cycloadduct, derived, from, the, addition, of, alkynes, to, 2, pyrone, eliminates, carbon, dioxide, to, give, the, aromatic, compound, other, specialized, cycloadditions, include, multicomponent, reactions, such, as, alkyne, trimerisation, to, give, aromatic, compounds, and, the, cycloaddition, of, an, alkyne, alkene, and, carbon, monoxide, in, the, pauson, khand, reaction, non, carbon, reagents, also, undergo, cyclization, e, g, azide, alkyne, huisgen, cycloaddition, to, give, triazoles, cycloaddition, processes, involving, alkynes, are, often, catalyzed, by, metals, e, g, enyne, metathesis, and, alkyne, metathesis, which, allows, the, scrambling, of, carbyne, rc, centers, oxidative, cleavage, of, alkynes, proceeds, via, cycloaddition, to, metal, oxides, most, famously, potassium, permanganate, converts, alkynes, to, a, pair, of, carboxylic, acids, terminal, alkynes, are, readily, converted, to, many, derivatives, e, g, by, coupling, reactions, and, condensations, via, the, condensation, with, formaldehyde, and, acetylene, is, produced, butynediol, in, the, sonogashira, reaction, terminal, alkynes, are, coupled, with, aryl, or, vinyl, halides, this, reactivity, exploits, the, fact, that, terminal, alkynes, are, weak, acids, whose, typical, p, k, a, values, around, 25, place, them, between, that, of, ammonia, 35, and, ethanol, 16, where, mx, nanh, 2, libu, or, rmgx, the, reactions, of, alkynes, with, certain, metal, cations, e, g, ag, and, cu, also, gives, acetylides, thus, few, drops, of, diamminesilver, i, hydroxide, ag, nh, 3, 2, oh, reacts, with, terminal, alkynes, signaled, by, formation, of, a, white, precipitate, of, the, silver, acetylide, this, reactivity, is, the, basis, of, alkyne, coupling, reactions, including, the, cadiot, chodkiewicz, coupling, glaser, coupling, and, the, eglinton, coupling, shown, below, in, the, favorskii, reaction, and, in, alkynylations, in, general, terminal, alkynes, add, to, carbonyl, compounds, to, give, the, hydroxyalkyne, alkynes, form, complexes, with, transition, metals, such, complexes, occur, also, in, metal, catalyzed, reactions, of, alkynes, such, as, alkyne, trimerization, terminal, alkynes, including, acetylene, itself, react, with, water, to, give, aldehydes, the, transformation, typically, requires, metal, catalysts, to, give, this, anti, markovnikov, addition, result, according, to, ferdinand, bohlmann, the, first, naturally, occurring, acetylenic, compound, dehydromatricaria, ester, was, isolated, from, an, artemisia, species, in, 1826, in, the, nearly, two, centuries, that, have, followed, well, over, a, thousand, naturally, occurring, acetylenes, have, been, discovered, and, reported, polyynes, a, subset, of, this, class, of, natural, products, have, been, isolated, from, a, wide, variety, of, plant, species, cultures, of, higher, fungi, bacteria, marine, sponges, and, corals, some, acids, like, tariric, acid, contain, an, alkyne, group, diynes, and, triynes, species, with, the, linkage, rc, c, c, cr, and, rc, c, c, c, c, cr, respectively, occur, in, certain, plants, ichthyothere, chrysanthemum, cicuta, oenanthe, and, other, members, of, the, asteraceae, and, apiaceae, families, some, examples, are, cicutoxin, oenanthotoxin, and, falcarinol, these, compounds, are, highly, bioactive, e, g, as, nematocides, 1, phenylhepta, 1, 3, 5, triyne, is, illustrative, of, a, naturally, occurring, triyne, alkynes, occur, in, some, pharmaceuticals, including, the, contraceptive, noretynodrel, a, carbon, carbon, triple, bond, is, also, present, in, marketed, drugs, such, as, the, antiretroviral, efavirenz, and, the, antifungal, terbinafine, molecules, called, ene, diynes, feature, a, ring, containing, an, alkene, ene, between, two, alkyne, groups, diyne, these, compounds, e, g, calicheamicin, are, some, of, the, most, aggressive, antitumor, drugs, known, so, much, so, that, the, ene, diyne, subunit, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, warhead, ene, diynes, undergo, rearrangement, via, the, bergman, cyclization, generating, highly, reactive, radical, intermediates, that, attack, dna, within, the, tumor
