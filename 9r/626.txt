a, valley, is, an, elongated, low, area, often, running, between, hills, or, mountains, and, typically, containing, a, river, or, stream, running, from, one, end, to, the, other, most, valleys, are, formed, by, erosion, of, the, land, surface, by, rivers, or, streams, over, a, very, long, period, some, valleys, are, formed, through, erosion, by, glacial, ice, these, glaciers, may, remain, present, in, valleys, in, high, mountains, or, polar, areas, at, lower, latitudes, and, altitudes, these, glacially, formed, valleys, may, have, been, created, or, enlarged, during, ice, ages, but, now, are, ice, free, and, occupied, by, streams, or, rivers, in, desert, areas, valleys, may, be, entirely, dry, or, carry, a, watercourse, only, rarely, in, areas, of, limestone, bedrock, dry, valleys, may, also, result, from, drainage, now, taking, place, underground, rather, than, at, the, surface, rift, valleys, arise, principally, from, earth, movements, rather, than, erosion, many, different, types, of, valleys, are, described, by, geographers, using, terms, that, may, be, global, in, use, or, else, applied, only, locally, valleys, may, arise, through, several, different, processes, most, commonly, they, arise, from, erosion, over, long, periods, by, moving, water, and, are, known, as, river, valleys, typically, small, valleys, containing, streams, feed, into, larger, valleys, which, in, turn, feed, into, larger, valleys, again, eventually, reaching, the, ocean, or, perhaps, an, internal, drainage, basin, in, polar, areas, and, at, high, altitudes, valleys, may, be, eroded, by, glaciers, these, typically, have, a, u, shaped, profile, in, cross, section, in, contrast, to, river, valleys, which, tend, to, have, a, v, shaped, profile, other, valleys, may, arise, principally, through, tectonic, processes, such, as, rifting, all, three, processes, can, contribute, to, the, development, of, a, valley, over, geological, time, the, flat, or, relatively, flat, portion, of, a, valley, between, its, sides, is, referred, to, as, the, valley, floor, the, valley, floor, is, typically, formed, by, river, sediments, and, may, have, fluvial, terraces, the, development, of, a, river, valley, is, affected, by, the, character, of, the, bedrock, over, which, the, river, or, stream, flows, the, elevational, difference, between, its, top, and, bottom, and, indeed, the, climate, typically, the, flow, will, increase, downstream, and, the, gradient, will, decrease, in, the, upper, valley, the, stream, will, most, effectively, erode, its, bed, through, corrasion, to, produce, a, steep, sided, v, shaped, valley, the, presence, of, more, resistant, rock, bands, of, geological, faults, fractures, and, folds, may, determine, the, course, of, the, stream, and, result, in, a, twisting, course, with, interlocking, spurs, in, the, middle, valley, as, numerous, streams, have, coalesced, the, valley, is, typically, wider, the, flow, slower, and, both, erosion, and, deposition, may, take, place, more, lateral, erosion, takes, place, in, the, middle, section, of, a, river, s, course, as, strong, currents, on, the, outside, of, its, curve, erode, the, bank, conversely, deposition, may, take, place, on, the, inside, of, curves, where, the, current, is, much, slacker, the, process, leading, to, the, river, assuming, a, meandering, character, in, the, lower, valley, gradients, are, lowest, meanders, may, be, much, broader, and, a, broader, floodplain, may, result, deposition, dominates, over, erosion, a, typical, river, basin, or, drainage, basin, will, incorporate, each, of, these, different, types, of, valleys, some, sections, of, a, stream, or, river, valleys, may, have, vertically, incised, their, course, to, such, an, extent, that, the, valley, they, occupy, is, best, described, as, a, gorge, ravine, or, canyon, rapid, down, cutting, may, result, from, localized, uplift, of, the, land, surface, or, rejuvenation, of, the, watercourse, as, a, result, for, example, of, a, reduction, in, the, base, level, to, which, the, river, is, eroded, e, g, lowered, global, sea, level, during, an, ice, age, such, rejuvenation, may, also, result, in, the, production, of, river, terraces, there, are, various, forms, of, valleys, associated, with, glaciation, true, glacial, valleys, are, those, that, have, been, cut, by, a, glacier, which, may, or, may, not, still, occupy, the, valley, at, the, present, day, such, valleys, may, also, be, known, as, glacial, troughs, they, typically, have, a, u, shaped, cross, section, and, are, characteristic, landforms, of, mountain, areas, where, glaciation, has, occurred, or, continues, to, take, place, the, uppermost, part, of, a, glacial, valley, frequently, consists, of, one, or, more, armchair, shaped, hollows, or, cirques, excavated, by, the, rotational, movement, downslope, of, a, cirque, glacier, during, glacial, periods, for, example, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, it, is, in, these, locations, that, glaciers, initially, form, and, then, as, the, ice, age, proceeds, extend, downhill, through, valleys, that, have, previously, been, shaped, by, water, rather, than, ice, abrasion, by, rock, material, embedded, within, the, moving, glacial, ice, causes, the, widening, and, deepening, of, the, valley, to, produce, the, characteristic, u, or, trough, shape, with, relatively, steep, even, vertical, sides, and, a, relatively, flat, bottom, interlocking, spurs, associated, with, the, development, of, river, valleys, are, preferentially, eroded, to, produce, truncated, spurs, typical, of, glaciated, mountain, landscapes, the, upper, end, of, the, trough, below, the, ice, contributing, cirques, may, be, a, trough, end, valley, steps, or, rock, steps, can, result, from, differing, erosion, rates, due, to, both, the, nature, of, the, bedrock, hardness, and, jointing, for, example, and, the, power, of, the, moving, ice, in, places, a, rock, basin, may, be, excavated, which, may, later, be, filled, with, water, to, form, a, ribbon, lake, or, else, by, sediments, such, features, are, found, in, coastal, areas, as, fjords, the, shape, of, the, valley, which, results, from, all, of, these, influences, may, only, become, visible, upon, the, recession, of, the, glacier, that, forms, it, a, river, or, stream, may, remain, in, the, valley, if, it, is, smaller, than, one, would, expect, given, the, size, of, its, valley, it, can, be, considered, an, example, of, a, misfit, stream, other, interesting, glacially, carved, valleys, include, a, tunnel, valley, is, a, large, long, u, shaped, valley, originally, cut, under, the, glacial, ice, near, the, margin, of, continental, ice, sheets, such, as, that, now, covering, antarctica, and, formerly, covering, portions, of, all, continents, during, past, glacial, ages, such, valleys, can, be, up, to, 100, km, 62, mi, long, 4, km, 2, 5, mi, wide, and, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, deep, its, depth, may, vary, along, its, length, tunnel, valleys, were, formed, by, subglacial, water, erosion, they, once, served, as, subglacial, drainage, pathways, carrying, large, volumes, of, meltwater, their, cross, sections, exhibit, steep, sided, flanks, similar, to, fjord, walls, and, their, flat, bottoms, are, typical, of, subglacial, glacial, erosion, in, northern, central, europe, the, scandinavian, ice, sheet, during, the, various, ice, ages, advanced, slightly, uphill, against, the, lie, of, the, land, as, a, result, its, meltwaters, flowed, parallel, to, the, ice, margin, to, reach, the, north, sea, basin, forming, huge, flat, valleys, known, as, urstromt, ler, unlike, the, other, forms, of, glacial, valleys, these, were, formed, by, glacial, meltwaters, depending, on, the, topography, the, rock, types, and, the, climate, a, variety, of, transitional, forms, between, v, u, and, plain, valleys, can, form, the, floor, or, bottom, of, these, valleys, can, be, broad, or, narrow, but, all, valleys, have, a, shoulder, the, broader, a, mountain, valley, the, lower, its, shoulders, are, located, in, most, cases, an, important, exception, is, canyons, where, the, shoulder, almost, is, near, the, top, of, the, valley, s, slope, in, the, alps, e, g, the, tyrolean, inn, valley, the, shoulders, are, quite, low, 100, 200, meters, above, the, bottom, many, villages, are, located, here, esp, on, the, sunny, side, because, the, climate, is, very, mild, even, in, winter, when, the, valley, s, floor, is, filled, with, fog, these, villages, are, in, sunshine, in, some, stress, tectonic, regions, of, the, rocky, mountains, or, the, alps, e, g, salzburg, the, side, valleys, are, parallel, to, each, other, and, are, hanging, smaller, streams, flow, into, rivers, as, deep, canyons, or, waterfalls, a, hanging, valley, is, a, tributary, valley, that, is, higher, than, the, main, valley, they, are, most, commonly, associated, with, u, shaped, valleys, where, a, tributary, glacier, flows, into, a, glacier, of, larger, volume, the, main, glacier, erodes, a, deep, u, shaped, valley, with, nearly, vertical, sides, while, the, tributary, glacier, with, a, smaller, volume, of, ice, makes, a, shallower, u, shaped, valley, since, the, surfaces, of, the, glaciers, were, originally, at, the, same, elevation, the, shallower, valley, appears, to, be, hanging, above, the, main, valley, often, waterfalls, form, at, or, near, the, outlet, of, the, upper, valley, hanging, valleys, also, occur, in, fjord, systems, underwater, the, branches, of, sognefjord, are, much, shallower, than, the, main, fjord, the, mouth, of, fj, rlandsfjord, is, about, 400, meters, 1, 300, ft, deep, while, the, main, fjord, nearby, is, 1, 200, meters, 3, 900, ft, deep, the, mouth, of, ikjefjord, is, only, 50, meters, 160, ft, deep, while, the, main, fjord, is, around, 1, 300, meters, 4, 300, ft, at, the, same, point, glaciated, terrain, is, not, the, only, site, of, hanging, streams, and, valleys, hanging, valleys, are, also, simply, the, product, of, varying, rates, of, erosion, of, the, main, valley, and, the, tributary, valleys, the, varying, rates, of, erosion, are, associated, with, the, composition, of, the, adjacent, rocks, in, the, different, valley, locations, the, tributary, valleys, are, eroded, and, deepened, by, glaciers, or, erosion, at, a, slower, rate, than, that, of, the, main, valley, floor, thus, the, difference, in, the, two, valleys, depth, increases, over, time, the, tributary, valley, composed, of, more, resistant, rock, then, hangs, over, the, main, valley, trough, shaped, valleys, also, form, in, regions, of, heavy, topographic, denudation, by, contrast, with, glacial, u, shaped, valleys, there, is, less, downward, and, sideways, erosion, the, severe, downslope, denudation, results, in, gently, sloping, valley, sides, their, transition, to, the, actual, valley, bottom, is, unclear, trough, shaped, valleys, occur, mainly, in, periglacial, regions, and, in, tropical, regions, of, variable, wetness, both, climates, are, dominated, by, heavy, denudation, box, valleys, have, wide, relatively, level, floors, and, steep, sides, they, are, common, in, periglacial, areas, and, occur, in, mid, latitudes, but, also, occur, in, tropical, and, arid, regions, rift, valleys, such, as, the, albertine, rift, and, gregory, rift, are, formed, by, the, expansion, of, the, earth, s, crust, due, to, tectonic, activity, beneath, the, earth, s, surface, there, are, many, terms, used, for, different, sorts, of, valleys, they, include, similar, geographical, features, such, as, gullies, chines, and, kloofs, are, not, usually, referred, to, as, valleys, the, terms, corrie, glen, and, strath, are, all, anglicisations, of, gaelic, terms, and, are, commonly, encountered, in, place, names, in, scotland, and, other, areas, where, gaelic, was, once, widespread, strath, signifies, a, wide, valley, between, hills, the, floor, of, which, is, either, level, or, slopes, gently, a, glen, is, a, river, valley, which, is, steeper, and, narrower, than, a, strath, a, corrie, is, a, basin, shaped, hollow, in, a, mountain, each, of, these, terms, also, occurs, in, parts, of, the, world, formerly, colonized, by, britain, corrie, is, used, more, widely, by, geographers, as, a, synonym, for, glacial, cirque, as, is, the, word, cwm, borrowed, from, welsh, the, word, dale, occurs, widely, in, place, names, in, the, north, of, england, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, southern, scotland, as, a, generic, name, for, a, type, of, valley, the, term, typically, refers, to, a, wide, valley, though, there, are, many, much, smaller, stream, valleys, within, the, yorkshire, dales, which, are, named, specific, name, dale, clough, is, a, word, in, common, use, in, northern, england, for, a, narrow, valley, with, steep, sides, gill, is, used, to, describe, a, ravine, containing, a, mountain, stream, in, cumbria, and, the, pennines, the, term, combe, also, encountered, as, coombe, is, widespread, in, southern, england, and, describes, a, short, valley, set, into, a, hillside, other, terms, for, small, valleys, such, as, hope, dean, slade, slack, and, bottom, are, commonly, encountered, in, place, names, in, various, parts, of, england, but, are, no, longer, in, general, use, as, synonyms, for, valley, the, term, vale, is, used, in, england, and, wales, to, describe, a, wide, river, valley, usually, with, a, particularly, wide, flood, plain, or, flat, valley, bottom, in, southern, england, vales, commonly, occur, between, the, outcrops, of, different, relatively, erosion, resistant, rock, formations, where, less, resistant, rock, often, claystone, has, been, eroded, an, example, is, the, vale, of, white, horse, in, oxfordshire, some, of, the, first, human, complex, societies, originated, in, river, valleys, such, as, that, of, the, nile, tigris, euphrates, indus, ganges, yangtze, yellow, river, mississippi, and, arguably, the, amazon, in, prehistory, the, rivers, were, used, as, a, source, of, fresh, water, and, food, fish, and, game, as, well, as, a, place, to, wash, and, a, sewer, the, proximity, of, water, moderated, temperature, extremes, and, provided, a, source, for, irrigation, stimulating, the, development, of, agriculture, most, of, the, first, civilizations, developed, from, these, river, valley, communities, siting, of, settlements, within, valleys, is, influenced, by, many, factors, including, the, need, to, avoid, flooding, and, the, location, of, river, crossing, points, numerous, elongate, depressions, have, been, identified, on, the, surface, of, mars, venus, the, moon, and, other, planets, and, their, satellites, and, are, known, as, valles, singular, vallis, deeper, valleys, with, steeper, sides, akin, to, canyons, on, certain, of, these, bodies, are, known, as, chasmata, singular, chasma, long, narrow, depressions, are, referred, to, as, fossae, singular, fossa, these, are, the, latin, terms, for, valley, gorge, and, ditch, respectively, the, german, term, rille, or, latin, term, rima, signifying, cleft, is, used, for, certain, other, elongate, depressions, on, the, moon, see, also
