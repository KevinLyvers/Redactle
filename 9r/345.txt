beryllium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, be, and, atomic, number, 4, it, is, a, steel, gray, hard, strong, lightweight, and, brittle, alkaline, earth, metal, it, is, a, divalent, element, that, occurs, naturally, only, in, combination, with, other, elements, to, form, minerals, gemstones, high, in, beryllium, include, beryl, aquamarine, emerald, red, beryl, and, chrysoberyl, it, is, a, relatively, rare, element, in, the, universe, usually, occurring, as, a, product, of, the, spallation, of, larger, atomic, nuclei, that, have, collided, with, cosmic, rays, within, the, cores, of, stars, beryllium, is, depleted, as, it, is, fused, into, heavier, elements, beryllium, constitutes, about, 0, 0004, percent, by, mass, of, earth, s, crust, the, world, s, annual, beryllium, production, of, 220, tons, is, usually, manufactured, by, extraction, from, the, mineral, beryl, a, difficult, process, because, beryllium, bonds, strongly, to, oxygen, in, structural, applications, the, combination, of, high, flexural, rigidity, thermal, stability, thermal, conductivity, and, low, density, 1, 85, times, that, of, water, make, beryllium, metal, a, desirable, aerospace, material, for, aircraft, components, missiles, spacecraft, and, satellites, because, of, its, low, density, and, atomic, mass, beryllium, is, relatively, transparent, to, x, rays, and, other, forms, of, ionizing, radiation, therefore, it, is, the, most, common, window, material, for, x, ray, equipment, and, components, of, particle, detectors, when, added, as, an, alloying, element, to, aluminium, copper, notably, the, alloy, beryllium, copper, iron, or, nickel, beryllium, improves, many, physical, properties, for, example, tools, and, components, made, of, beryllium, copper, alloys, are, strong, and, hard, and, do, not, create, sparks, when, they, strike, a, steel, surface, in, air, the, surface, of, beryllium, oxidizes, readily, at, room, temperature, to, form, a, passivation, layer, 1, 10, nm, thick, that, protects, it, from, further, oxidation, and, corrosion, the, metal, oxidizes, in, bulk, beyond, the, passivation, layer, when, heated, above, 500, c, 932, f, and, burns, brilliantly, when, heated, to, about, 2, 500, c, 4, 530, f, the, commercial, use, of, beryllium, requires, the, use, of, appropriate, dust, control, equipment, and, industrial, controls, at, all, times, because, of, the, toxicity, of, inhaled, beryllium, containing, dusts, that, can, cause, a, chronic, life, threatening, allergic, disease, berylliosis, in, some, people, berylliosis, causes, pneumonia, and, other, associated, respiratory, illness, beryllium, is, a, steel, gray, and, hard, metal, that, is, brittle, at, room, temperature, and, has, a, close, packed, hexagonal, crystal, structure, it, has, exceptional, stiffness, young, s, modulus, 287, gpa, and, a, melting, point, of, 1287, c, the, modulus, of, elasticity, of, beryllium, is, approximately, 35, greater, than, that, of, steel, the, combination, of, this, modulus, and, a, relatively, low, density, results, in, an, unusually, fast, sound, conduction, speed, in, beryllium, about, 12, 9, km, s, at, ambient, conditions, other, significant, properties, are, high, specific, heat, 1925, j, kg, 1, k, 1, and, thermal, conductivity, 216, w, m, 1, k, 1, which, make, beryllium, the, metal, with, the, best, heat, dissipation, characteristics, per, unit, weight, in, combination, with, the, relatively, low, coefficient, of, linear, thermal, expansion, 11, 4, 10, 6, k, 1, these, characteristics, result, in, a, unique, stability, under, conditions, of, thermal, loading, naturally, occurring, beryllium, save, for, slight, contamination, by, the, cosmogenic, radioisotopes, is, isotopically, pure, beryllium, 9, which, has, a, nuclear, spin, of, 3, 2, beryllium, has, a, large, scattering, cross, section, for, high, energy, neutrons, about, 6, barns, for, energies, above, approximately, 10, kev, therefore, it, works, as, a, neutron, reflector, and, neutron, moderator, effectively, slowing, the, neutrons, to, the, thermal, energy, range, of, below, 0, 03, ev, where, the, total, cross, section, is, at, least, an, order, of, magnitude, lower, the, exact, value, strongly, depends, on, the, purity, and, size, of, the, crystallites, in, the, material, the, single, primordial, beryllium, isotope, 9, be, also, undergoes, a, n, 2n, neutron, reaction, with, neutron, energies, over, about, 1, 9, mev, to, produce, 8, be, which, almost, immediately, breaks, into, two, alpha, particles, thus, for, high, energy, neutrons, beryllium, is, a, neutron, multiplier, releasing, more, neutrons, than, it, absorbs, this, nuclear, reaction, is, neutrons, are, liberated, when, beryllium, nuclei, are, struck, by, energetic, alpha, particles, producing, the, nuclear, reaction, where, 4, 2, he, is, an, alpha, particle, and, 12, 6, c, is, a, carbon, 12, nucleus, beryllium, also, releases, neutrons, under, bombardment, by, gamma, rays, thus, natural, beryllium, bombarded, either, by, alphas, or, gammas, from, a, suitable, radioisotope, is, a, key, component, of, most, radioisotope, powered, nuclear, reaction, neutron, sources, for, the, laboratory, production, of, free, neutrons, small, amounts, of, tritium, are, liberated, when, 9, 4, be, nuclei, absorb, low, energy, neutrons, in, the, three, step, nuclear, reaction, 6, 2, he, has, a, half, life, of, only, 0, 8, seconds, is, an, electron, and, 6, 3, li, has, a, high, neutron, absorption, cross, section, tritium, is, a, radioisotope, of, concern, in, nuclear, reactor, waste, streams, as, a, metal, beryllium, is, transparent, or, translucent, to, most, wavelengths, of, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, making, it, useful, for, the, output, windows, of, x, ray, tubes, and, other, such, apparatus, both, stable, and, unstable, isotopes, of, beryllium, are, created, in, stars, but, the, radioisotopes, do, not, last, long, it, is, believed, that, most, of, the, stable, beryllium, in, the, universe, was, originally, created, in, the, interstellar, medium, when, cosmic, rays, induced, fission, in, heavier, elements, found, in, interstellar, gas, and, dust, primordial, beryllium, contains, only, one, stable, isotope, 9, be, and, therefore, beryllium, is, uniquely, among, all, stable, elements, with, an, even, atomic, number, a, monoisotopic, and, mononuclidic, element, radioactive, cosmogenic, 10, be, is, produced, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, earth, by, the, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, oxygen, 10, be, accumulates, at, the, soil, surface, where, its, relatively, long, half, life, 1, 36, million, years, permits, a, long, residence, time, before, decaying, to, boron, 10, thus, 10, be, and, its, daughter, products, are, used, to, examine, natural, soil, erosion, soil, formation, and, the, development, of, lateritic, soils, and, as, a, proxy, for, measurement, of, the, variations, in, solar, activity, and, the, age, of, ice, cores, the, production, of, 10, be, is, inversely, proportional, to, solar, activity, because, increased, solar, wind, during, periods, of, high, solar, activity, decreases, the, flux, of, galactic, cosmic, rays, that, reach, the, earth, nuclear, explosions, also, form, 10, be, by, the, reaction, of, fast, neutrons, with, 13, c, in, the, carbon, dioxide, in, air, this, is, one, of, the, indicators, of, past, activity, at, nuclear, weapon, test, sites, the, isotope, 7, be, half, life, 53, days, is, also, cosmogenic, and, shows, an, atmospheric, abundance, linked, to, sunspots, much, like, 10, be, 8, be, has, a, very, short, half, life, of, about, 8, 10, 17, s, that, contributes, to, its, significant, cosmological, role, as, elements, heavier, than, beryllium, could, not, have, been, produced, by, nuclear, fusion, in, the, big, bang, this, is, due, to, the, lack, of, sufficient, time, during, the, big, bang, s, nucleosynthesis, phase, to, produce, carbon, by, the, fusion, of, 4, he, nuclei, and, the, very, low, concentrations, of, available, beryllium, 8, british, astronomer, sir, fred, hoyle, first, showed, that, the, energy, levels, of, 8, be, and, 12, c, allow, carbon, production, by, the, so, called, triple, alpha, process, in, helium, fueled, stars, where, more, nucleosynthesis, time, is, available, this, process, allows, carbon, to, be, produced, in, stars, but, not, in, the, big, bang, star, created, carbon, the, basis, of, carbon, based, life, is, thus, a, component, in, the, elements, in, the, gas, and, dust, ejected, by, agb, stars, and, supernovae, see, also, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, as, well, as, the, creation, of, all, other, elements, with, atomic, numbers, larger, than, that, of, carbon, the, 2s, electrons, of, beryllium, may, contribute, to, chemical, bonding, therefore, when, 7, be, decays, by, l, electron, capture, it, does, so, by, taking, electrons, from, its, atomic, orbitals, that, may, be, participating, in, bonding, this, makes, its, decay, rate, dependent, to, a, measurable, degree, upon, its, chemical, surroundings, a, rare, occurrence, in, nuclear, decay, the, shortest, lived, known, isotope, of, beryllium, is, 16, be, which, decays, through, neutron, emission, with, a, half, life, of, 6, 5, 10, 22, s, the, exotic, isotopes, 11, be, and, 14, be, are, known, to, exhibit, a, nuclear, halo, this, phenomenon, can, be, understood, as, the, nuclei, of, 11, be, and, 14, be, have, respectively, 1, and, 4, neutrons, orbiting, substantially, outside, the, classical, fermi, waterdrop, model, of, the, nucleus, the, sun, has, a, concentration, of, 0, 1, parts, per, billion, ppb, of, beryllium, beryllium, has, a, concentration, of, 2, to, 6, parts, per, million, ppm, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, the, 47th, most, abundant, element, it, is, most, concentrated, in, the, soils, at, 6, ppm, trace, amounts, of, 9, be, are, found, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, concentration, of, beryllium, in, sea, water, is, 0, 2, 0, 6, parts, per, trillion, in, stream, water, however, beryllium, is, more, abundant, with, a, concentration, of, 0, 1, ppb, beryllium, is, found, in, over, 100, minerals, but, most, are, uncommon, to, rare, the, more, common, beryllium, containing, minerals, include, bertrandite, be, 4, si, 2, o, 7, oh, 2, beryl, al, 2, be, 3, si, 6, o, 18, chrysoberyl, al, 2, beo, 4, and, phenakite, be, 2, sio, 4, precious, forms, of, beryl, are, aquamarine, red, beryl, and, emerald, the, green, color, in, gem, quality, forms, of, beryl, comes, from, varying, amounts, of, chromium, about, 2, for, emerald, the, two, main, ores, of, beryllium, beryl, and, bertrandite, are, found, in, argentina, brazil, india, madagascar, russia, and, the, united, states, total, world, reserves, of, beryllium, ore, are, greater, than, 400, 000, tonnes, the, extraction, of, beryllium, from, its, compounds, is, a, difficult, process, due, to, its, high, affinity, for, oxygen, at, elevated, temperatures, and, its, ability, to, reduce, water, when, its, oxide, film, is, removed, currently, the, united, states, china, and, kazakhstan, are, the, only, three, countries, involved, in, the, industrial, scale, extraction, of, beryllium, kazakhstan, produces, beryllium, from, a, concentrate, stockpiled, before, the, breakup, of, the, soviet, union, around, 1991, this, resource, had, become, nearly, depleted, by, mid, 2010s, production, of, beryllium, in, russia, was, halted, in, 1997, and, is, planned, to, be, resumed, in, the, 2020s, beryllium, is, most, commonly, extracted, from, the, mineral, beryl, which, is, either, sintered, using, an, extraction, agent, or, melted, into, a, soluble, mixture, the, sintering, process, involves, mixing, beryl, with, sodium, fluorosilicate, and, soda, at, 770, c, 1, 420, f, to, form, sodium, fluoroberyllate, aluminium, oxide, and, silicon, dioxide, beryllium, hydroxide, is, precipitated, from, a, solution, of, sodium, fluoroberyllate, and, sodium, hydroxide, in, water, the, extraction, of, beryllium, using, the, melt, method, involves, grinding, beryl, into, a, powder, and, heating, it, to, 1, 650, c, 3, 000, f, the, melt, is, quickly, cooled, with, water, and, then, reheated, 250, to, 300, c, 482, to, 572, f, in, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, mostly, yielding, beryllium, sulfate, and, aluminium, sulfate, aqueous, ammonia, is, then, used, to, remove, the, aluminium, and, sulfur, leaving, beryllium, hydroxide, beryllium, hydroxide, created, using, either, the, sinter, or, melt, method, is, then, converted, into, beryllium, fluoride, or, beryllium, chloride, to, form, the, fluoride, aqueous, ammonium, hydrogen, fluoride, is, added, to, beryllium, hydroxide, to, yield, a, precipitate, of, ammonium, tetrafluoroberyllate, which, is, heated, to, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, to, form, beryllium, fluoride, heating, the, fluoride, to, 900, c, 1, 650, f, with, magnesium, forms, finely, divided, beryllium, and, additional, heating, to, 1, 300, c, 2, 370, f, creates, the, compact, metal, heating, beryllium, hydroxide, forms, the, oxide, which, becomes, beryllium, chloride, when, combined, with, carbon, and, chlorine, electrolysis, of, molten, beryllium, chloride, is, then, used, to, obtain, the, metal, beryllium, has, a, high, electronegativity, compared, to, other, group, 2, elements, thus, c, be, bonds, are, less, highly, polarized, than, other, c, m, ii, bonds, although, the, attached, carbon, still, bears, a, negative, dipole, moment, a, beryllium, atom, has, the, electronic, configuration, 2s, 2, the, predominant, oxidation, state, of, beryllium, is, 2, the, beryllium, atom, has, lost, both, of, its, valence, electrons, lower, oxidation, states, complexes, of, beryllium, are, exceedingly, rare, for, example, bis, carbene, compounds, proposed, to, contain, beryllium, in, the, 0, and, 1, oxidation, state, have, been, reported, although, these, claims, have, proved, controversial, a, stable, complex, with, a, be, be, bond, which, formally, features, beryllium, in, the, 1, oxidation, state, has, been, described, beryllium, s, chemical, behavior, is, largely, a, result, of, its, small, atomic, and, ionic, radii, it, thus, has, very, high, ionization, potentials, and, strong, polarization, while, bonded, to, other, atoms, which, is, why, all, of, its, compounds, are, covalent, its, chemistry, has, similarities, to, that, of, aluminium, an, example, of, a, diagonal, relationship, at, room, temperature, the, surface, of, beryllium, forms, a, 1, 10, nm, thick, oxide, passivation, layer, that, prevents, further, reactions, with, air, except, for, gradual, thickening, of, the, oxide, up, to, about, 25, nm, when, heated, above, about, 500, c, oxidation, into, the, bulk, metal, progresses, along, grain, boundaries, once, the, metal, is, ignited, in, air, by, heating, above, the, oxide, melting, point, around, 2500, c, beryllium, burns, brilliantly, forming, a, mixture, of, beryllium, oxide, and, beryllium, nitride, beryllium, dissolves, readily, in, non, oxidizing, acids, such, as, hcl, and, diluted, h, 2, so, 4, but, not, in, nitric, acid, or, water, as, this, forms, the, oxide, this, behavior, is, similar, to, that, of, aluminium, beryllium, also, dissolves, in, alkali, solutions, binary, compounds, of, beryllium, ii, are, polymeric, in, the, solid, state, bef, 2, has, a, silica, like, structure, with, corner, shared, bef, 4, tetrahedra, becl, 2, and, bebr, 2, have, chain, structures, with, edge, shared, tetrahedra, beryllium, oxide, beo, is, a, white, refractory, solid, which, has, a, wurtzite, crystal, structure, and, a, thermal, conductivity, as, high, as, some, metals, beo, is, amphoteric,

been, identified, the, halides, bex, 2, x, f, cl, br, and, i, have, a, linear, monomeric, molecular, structure, in, the, gas, phase, complexes, of, the, halides, are, formed, with, one, or, more, ligands, donating, a, total, of, two, pairs, of, electrons, such, compounds, obey, the, octet, rule, other, 4, coordinate, complexes, such, as, the, aqua, ion, 2, also, obey, the, octet, rule, solutions, of, beryllium, salts, such, as, beryllium, sulfate, and, beryllium, nitrate, are, acidic, because, of, hydrolysis, of, the, 2, ion, the, concentration, of, the, first, hydrolysis, product, is, less, than, 1, of, the, beryllium, concentration, the, most, stable, hydrolysis, product, is, the, trimeric, ion, 3, beryllium, hydroxide, be, oh, 2, is, insoluble, in, water, at, ph, 5, or, more, consequently, beryllium, compounds, are, generally, insoluble, at, biological, ph, because, of, this, inhalation, of, beryllium, metal, dust, by, people, leads, to, the, development, of, the, fatal, condition, of, berylliosis, be, oh, 2, dissolves, in, strongly, alkaline, solutions, beryllium, ii, forms, few, complexes, with, monodentate, ligands, because, the, water, molecules, in, the, aquo, ion, 2, are, bound, very, strongly, to, the, beryllium, ion, notable, exceptions, are, the, series, of, water, soluble, complexes, with, the, fluoride, ion, be, h, 2, o, 4, 2, n, f, be, h, 2, o, 2, n,

with, amino, acids, but, unfortunately, they, are, not, reliable, as, the, concomitant, hydrolysis, reactions, were, not, understood, at, the, time, of, publication, values, for, log, of, ca, 6, to, 7, have, been, reported, the, degree, of, formation, is, small, because, of, competition, with, hydrolysis, reactions, organoberyllium, chemistry, is, limited, to, academic, research, due, to, the, cost, and, toxicity, of, beryllium, beryllium, derivatives, and, reagents, required, for, the, introduction, of, beryllium, such, as, beryllium, chloride, organometallic, beryllium, compounds, are,

iodide, was, investigated, following, the, success, of, a, similar, process, for, the, production, of, zirconium, but, this, process, proved, to, be, uneconomical, for, volume, production, pure, beryllium, metal, did, not, become, readily, available, until, 1957, even, though, it, had, been, used, as, an, alloying, metal, to, harden, and, toughen, copper, much, earlier, beryllium, could, be, produced, by, reducing, beryllium, compounds, such, as, beryllium, chloride, with, metallic, potassium, or, sodium, currently, most, beryllium, is, produced, by, reducing, beryllium, fluoride, with, magnesium, the, price, on, the, american, market, for, vacuum, cast, beryllium, ingots, was, about, 338, per, pound, 745, per, kilogram, in, 2001, between, 1998, and, 2008, the, world, s, production, of, beryllium, had, decreased, from, 343, to, about, 200, tonnes, it, then, increased, to, 230, metric, tons, by, 2018, of, which, 170, tonnes, came, from, the, united, states, beryllium, was, named, for, the, semiprecious, mineral, beryl, from, which, it, was, first, isolated, because, of, its, low, atomic, number, and, very, low, absorption, for, x, rays, the, oldest, and, still, one, of, the, most, important, applications, of, beryllium, is, in, radiation, windows, for, x, ray, tubes, extreme, demands, are, placed, on, purity, and, cleanliness, of, beryllium, to, avoid, artifacts, in, the, x, ray, images, thin, beryllium, foils, are, used, as, radiation, windows, for, x, ray, detectors, and, their, extremely, low, absorption, minimizes, the, heating, effects, caused, by, high, intensity, low, energy, x, rays, typical, of, synchrotron, radiation, vacuum, tight, windows, and, beam, tubes, for, radiation, experiments, on, synchrotrons, are, manufactured, exclusively, from, beryllium, in, scientific, setups, for, various, x, ray, emission, studies, e, g, energy, dispersive, x, ray, spectroscopy, the, sample, holder, is, usually, made, of, beryllium, because, its, emitted, x, rays, have, much, lower, energies, 100, ev, than, x, rays, from, most, studied, materials, low, atomic, number, also, makes, beryllium, relatively, transparent, to, energetic, particles, therefore, it, is, used, to, build, the, beam, pipe, around, the, collision, region, in, particle, physics, setups, such, as, all, four, main, detector, experiments, at, the, large, hadron, collider, alice, atlas, cms, lhcb, the, tevatron, and, at, slac, the, low, density, of, beryllium, allows, collision, products, to, reach, the, surrounding, detectors, without, significant, interaction, its, stiffness, allows, a, powerful, vacuum, to, be, produced, within, the, pipe, to, minimize, interaction, with, gases, its, thermal, stability, allows, it, to, function, correctly, at, temperatures, of, only, a, few, degrees, above, absolute, zero, and, its, diamagnetic, nature, keeps, it, from, interfering, with, the, complex, multipole, magnet, systems, used, to, steer, and, focus, the, particle, beams, because, of, its, stiffness, light, weight, and, dimensional, stability, over, a, wide, temperature, range, beryllium, metal, is, used, for, lightweight, structural, components, in, the, defense, and, aerospace, industries, in, high, speed, aircraft, guided, missiles, spacecraft, and, satellites, including, the, james, webb, space, telescope, several, liquid, fuel, rockets, have, used, rocket, nozzles, made, of, pure, beryllium, beryllium, powder, was, itself, studied, as, a, rocket, fuel, but, this, use, has, never, materialized, a, small, number, of, extreme, high, end, bicycle, frames, have, been, built, with, beryllium, from, 1998, to, 2000, the, mclaren, formula, one, team, used, mercedes, benz, engines, with, beryllium, aluminium, alloy, pistons, the, use, of, beryllium, engine, components, was, banned, following, a, protest, by, scuderia, ferrari, mixing, about, 2, 0, beryllium, into, copper, forms, an, alloy, called, beryllium, copper, that, is, six, times, stronger, than, copper, alone, beryllium, alloys, are, used, in, many, applications, because, of, their, combination, of, elasticity, high, electrical, conductivity, and, thermal, conductivity, high, strength, and, hardness, nonmagnetic, properties, as, well, as, good, corrosion, and, fatigue, resistance, these, applications, include, non, sparking, tools, that, are, used, near, flammable, gases, beryllium, nickel, in, springs, and, membranes, beryllium, nickel, and, beryllium, iron, used, in, surgical, instruments, and, high, temperature, devices, as, little, as, 50, parts, per, million, of, beryllium, alloyed, with, liquid, magnesium, leads, to, a, significant, increase, in, oxidation, resistance, and, decrease, in, flammability, the, high, elastic, stiffness, of, beryllium, has, led, to, its, extensive, use, in, precision, instrumentation, e, g, in, inertial, guidance, systems, and, in, the, support, mechanisms, for, optical, systems, beryllium, copper, alloys, were, also, applied, as, a, hardening, agent, in, jason, pistols, which, were, used, to, strip, the, paint, from, the, hulls, of, ships, in, sound, amplification, systems, the, speed, at, which, sound, travels, directly, affects, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, amplifier, thereby, influencing, the, range, of, audible, high, frequency, sounds, beryllium, stands, out, due, to, its, exceptionally, high, speed, of, sound, propagation, compared, to, other, metals, this, unique, property, allows, beryllium, to, achieve, higher, resonant, frequencies, making, it, an, ideal, material, for, use, as, a, diaphragm, in, high, quality, loudspeakers, beryllium, was, also, used, for, cantilevers, in, high, performance, phonograph, cartridge, styli, where, its, extreme, stiffness, and, low, density, allowed, for, tracking, weights, to, be, reduced, to, 1, gram, while, still, tracking, high, frequency, passages, with, minimal, distortion, an, earlier, major, application, of, beryllium, was, in, brakes, for, military, airplanes, because, of, its, hardness, high, melting, point, and, exceptional, ability, to, dissipate, heat, environmental, considerations, have, led, to, substitution, by, other, materials, to, reduce, costs, beryllium, can, be, alloyed, with, significant, amounts, of, aluminium, resulting, in, the, albemet, alloy, a, trade, name, this, blend, is, cheaper, than, pure, beryllium, while, still, retaining, many, desirable, properties, beryllium, mirrors, are, of, particular, interest, large, area, mirrors, frequently, with, a, honeycomb, support, structure, are, used, for, example, in, meteorological, satellites, where, low, weight, and, long, term, dimensional, stability, are, critical, smaller, beryllium, mirrors, are, used, in, optical, guidance, systems, and, in, fire, control, systems, e, g, in, the, german, made, leopard, 1, and, leopard, 2, main, battle, tanks, in, these, systems, very, rapid, movement, of, the, mirror, is, required, which, again, dictates, low, mass, and, high, rigidity, usually, the, beryllium, mirror, is, coated, with, hard, electroless, nickel, plating, which, can, be, more, easily, polished, to, a, finer, optical, finish, than, beryllium, in, some, applications, though, the, beryllium, blank, is, polished, without, any, coating, this, is, particularly, applicable, to, cryogenic, operation, where, thermal, expansion, mismatch, can, cause, the, coating, to, buckle, the, james, webb, space, telescope, has, 18, hexagonal, beryllium, sections, for, its, mirrors, each, plated, with, a, thin, layer, of, gold, because, jwst, will, face, a, temperature, of, 33, k, the, mirror, is, made, of, gold, plated, beryllium, which, is, capable, of, handling, extreme, cold, better, than, glass, beryllium, contracts, and, deforms, less, than, glass, and, remains, more, uniform, in, such, temperatures, for, the, same, reason, the, optics, of, the, spitzer, space, telescope, are, entirely, built, of, beryllium, metal, beryllium, is, non, magnetic, therefore, tools, fabricated, out, of, beryllium, based, materials, are, used, by, naval, or, military, explosive, ordnance, disposal, teams, for, work, on, or, near, naval, mines, since, these, mines, commonly, have, magnetic, fuzes, they, are, also, found, in, maintenance, and, construction, materials, near, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, machines, because, of, the, high, magnetic, fields, generated, in, the, fields, of, radio, communications, and, powerful, usually, military, radars, hand, tools, made, of, beryllium, are, used, to, tune, the, highly, magnetic, klystrons, magnetrons, traveling, wave, tubes, etc, that, are, used, for, generating, high, levels, of, microwave, power, in, the, transmitters, thin, plates, or, foils, of, beryllium, are, sometimes, used, in, nuclear, weapon, designs, as, the, very, outer, layer, of, the, plutonium, pits, in, the, primary, stages, of, thermonuclear, bombs, placed, to, surround, the, fissile, material, these, layers, of, beryllium, are, good, pushers, for, the, implosion, of, the, plutonium, 239, and, they, are, good, neutron, reflectors, just, as, in, beryllium, moderated, nuclear, reactors, beryllium, is, also, commonly, used, in, some, neutron, sources, in, laboratory, devices, in, which, relatively, few, neutrons, are, needed, rather, than, having, to, use, a, nuclear, reactor, or, a, particle, accelerator, powered, neutron, generator, for, this, purpose, a, target, of, beryllium, 9, is, bombarded, with, energetic, alpha, particles, from, a, radioisotope, such, as, polonium, 210, radium, 226, plutonium, 238, or, americium, 241, in, the, nuclear, reaction, that, occurs, a, beryllium, nucleus, is, transmuted, into, carbon, 12, and, one, free, neutron, is, emitted, traveling, in, about, the, same, direction, as, the, alpha, particle, was, heading, such, alpha, decay, driven, beryllium, neutron, sources, named, urchin, neutron, initiators, were, used, in, some, early, atomic, bombs, neutron, sources, in, which, beryllium, is, bombarded, with, gamma, rays, from, a, gamma, decay, radioisotope, are, also, used, to, produce, laboratory, neutrons, beryllium, is, also, used, in, fuel, fabrication, for, candu, reactors, the, fuel, elements, have, small, appendages, that, are, resistance, brazed, to, the, fuel, cladding, using, an, induction, brazing, process, with, be, as, the, braze, filler, material, bearing, pads, are, brazed, in, place, to, prevent, contact, between, the, fuel, bundle, and, the, pressure, tube, containing, it, and, inter, element, spacer, pads, are, brazed, on, to, prevent, element, to, element, contact, beryllium, is, also, used, at, the, joint, european, torus, nuclear, fusion, research, laboratory, and, it, will, be, used, in, the, more, advanced, iter, to, condition, the, components, which, face, the, plasma, beryllium, has, also, been, proposed, as, a, cladding, material, for, nuclear, fuel, rods, because, of, its, good, combination, of, mechanical, chemical, and, nuclear, properties, beryllium, fluoride, is, one, of, the, constituent, salts, of, the, eutectic, salt, mixture, flibe, which, is, used, as, a, solvent, moderator, and, coolant, in, many, hypothetical, molten, salt, reactor, designs, including, the, liquid, fluoride, thorium, reactor, lftr, the, low, weight, and, high, rigidity, of, beryllium, make, it, useful, as, a, material, for, high, frequency, speaker, drivers, because, beryllium, is, expensive, many, times, more, than, titanium, hard, to, shape, due, to, its, brittleness, and, toxic, if, mishandled, beryllium, tweeters, are, limited, to, high, end, home, pro, audio, and, public, address, applications, some, high, fidelity, products, have, been, fraudulently, claimed, to, be, made, of, the, material, some, high, end, phonograph, cartridges, used, beryllium, cantilevers, to, improve, tracking, by, reducing, mass, beryllium, is, a, p, type, dopant, in, iii, v, compound, semiconductors, it, is, widely, used, in, materials, such, as, gaas, algaas, ingaas, and, inalas, grown, by, molecular, beam, epitaxy, mbe, cross, rolled, beryllium, sheet, is, an, excellent, structural, support, for, printed, circuit, boards, in, surface, mount, technology, in, critical, electronic, applications, beryllium, is, both, a, structural, support, and, heat, sink, the, application, also, requires, a, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, that, is, well, matched, to, the, alumina, and, polyimide, glass, substrates, the, beryllium, beryllium, oxide, composite, e, materials, have, been, specially, designed, for, these, electronic, applications, and, have, the, additional, advantage, that, the, thermal, expansion, coefficient, can, be, tailored, to, match, diverse, substrate, materials, beryllium, oxide, is, useful, for, many, applications, that, require, the, combined, properties, of, an, electrical, insulator, and, an, excellent, heat, conductor, with, high, strength, and, hardness, and, a, very, high, melting, point, beryllium, oxide, is, frequently, used, as, an, insulator, base, plate, in, high, power, transistors, in, radio, frequency, transmitters, for, telecommunications, beryllium, oxide, is, also, being, studied, for, use, in, increasing, the, thermal, conductivity, of, uranium, dioxide, nuclear, fuel, pellets, beryllium, compounds, were, used, in, fluorescent, lighting, tubes, but, this, use, was, discontinued, because, of, the, disease, berylliosis, which, developed, in, the, workers, who, were, making, the, tubes, beryllium, is, a, component, of, several, dental, alloys, approximately, 35, micrograms, of, beryllium, is, found, in, the, average, human, body, an, amount, not, considered, harmful, beryllium, is, chemically, similar, to, magnesium, and, therefore, can, displace, it, from, enzymes, which, causes, them, to, malfunction, because, be, 2, is, a, highly, charged, and, small, ion, it, can, easily, get, into, many, tissues, and, cells, where, it, specifically, targets, cell, nuclei, inhibiting, many, enzymes, including, those, used, for, synthesizing, dna, its, toxicity, is, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, the, body, has, no, means, to, control, beryllium, levels, and, once, inside, the, body, beryllium, cannot, be, removed, chronic, beryllium, disease, cbd, or, berylliosis, is, a, pulmonary, and, systemic, granulomatous, disease, caused, by, inhalation, of, dust, or, fumes, contaminated, with, beryllium, either, large, amounts, over, a, short, time, or, small, amounts, over, a, long, time, can, lead, to, this, ailment, symptoms, of, the, disease, can, take, up, to, five, years, to, develop, about, a, third, of, patients, with, it, die, and, the, survivors, are, left, disabled, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, lists, beryllium, and, beryllium, compounds, as, category, 1, carcinogens, in, the, us, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, designated, a, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, for, beryllium, and, beryllium, compounds, of, 0, 2, g, m, 3, as, an, 8, hour, time, weighted, average, twa, and, 2, 0, g,

limit, rel, upper, bound, threshold, of, 0, 5, g, m, 3, the, idlh, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, value, is, 4, mg, m, 3, the, toxicity, of, beryllium, is, on, par, with, other, toxic, metalloids, metals, such, as, arsenic, and, mercury, exposure, to, beryllium, in, the, workplace, can, lead, to, a, sensitized, immune, response, and, over, time, develop, berylliosis, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, in, the, united, states, researches, these, effects, in, collaboration, with, a, major, manufacturer, of, beryllium, products, niosh, also, conducts, genetic, research, on, sensitization, and, cbd, independently, of, this, collaboration, acute, beryllium, disease, in, the, form, of, chemical, pneumonitis, was, first, reported, in, europe, in, 1933, and, in, the, united, states, in, 1943, a, survey, found, that, about, 5, of, workers, in, plants, manufacturing, fluorescent, lamps, in, 1949, in, the, united, states, had, beryllium, related, lung, diseases, chronic, berylliosis, resembles, sarcoidosis, in, many, respects, and, the, differential, diagnosis, is, often, difficult, it, killed, some, early, workers, in, nuclear, weapons, design, such, as, herbert, l, anderson, beryllium, may, be, found, in, coal, slag, when, the, slag, is, formulated, into, an, abrasive, agent, for, blasting, paint, and, rust, from, hard, surfaces, the, beryllium, can, become, airborne, and, become, a, source, of, exposure, although, the, use, of, beryllium, compounds, in, fluorescent, lighting, tubes, was, discontinued, in, 1949, potential, for, exposure, to, beryllium, exists, in, the, nuclear, and, aerospace, industries, in, the, refining, of, beryllium, metal, and, the, melting, of, beryllium, containing, alloys, in, the, manufacturing, of, electronic, devices, and, in, the, handling, of, other, beryllium, containing, material, early, researchers, undertook, the, highly, hazardous, practice, of, identifying, beryllium, and, its, various, compounds, from, its, sweet, taste, a, modern, test, for, beryllium, in, air, and, on, surfaces, has, been, developed, and, published, as, an, international, voluntary, consensus, standard, astm, d7202, the, procedure, uses, dilute, ammonium, bifluoride, for, dissolution, and, fluorescence, detection, with, beryllium, bound, to, sulfonated, hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing, up,
