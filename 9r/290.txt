quantum, chemistry, also, called, molecular, quantum, mechanics, is, a, branch, of, physical, chemistry, focused, on, the, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, chemical, systems, particularly, towards, the, quantum, mechanical, calculation, of, electronic, contributions, to, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, molecules, materials, and, solutions, at, the, atomic, level, these, calculations, include, systematically, applied, approximations, intended, to, make, calculations, computationally, feasible, while, still, capturing, as, much, information, about, important, contributions, to, the, computed, wave, functions, as, well, as, to, observable, properties, such, as, structures, spectra, and, thermodynamic, properties, quantum, chemistry, is, also, concerned, with, the, computation, of, quantum, effects, on, molecular, dynamics, and, chemical, kinetics, chemists, rely, heavily, on, spectroscopy, through, which, information, regarding, the, quantization, of, energy, on, a, molecular, scale, can, be, obtained, common, methods, are, infra, red, ir, spectroscopy, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, spectroscopy, and, scanning, probe, microscopy, quantum, chemistry, may, be, applied, to, the, prediction, and, verification, of, spectroscopic, data, as, well, as, other, experimental, data, many, quantum, chemistry, studies, are, focused, on, the, electronic, ground, state, and, excited, states, of, individual, atoms, and, molecules, as, well, as, the, study, of, reaction, pathways, and, transition, states, that, occur, during, chemical, reactions, spectroscopic, properties, may, also, be, predicted, typically, such, studies, assume, the, electronic, wave, function, is, adiabatically, parameterized, by, the, nuclear, positions, i, e, the, born, oppenheimer, approximation, a, wide, variety, of, approaches, are, used, including, semi, empirical, methods, density, functional, theory, hartree, fock, calculations, quantum, monte, carlo, methods, and, coupled, cluster, methods, understanding, electronic, structure, and, molecular, dynamics, through, the, development, of, computational, solutions, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, a, central, goal, of, quantum, chemistry, progress, in, the, field, depends, on, overcoming, several, challenges, including, the, need, to, increase, the, accuracy, of, the, results, for, small, molecular, systems, and, to, also, increase, the, size, of, large, molecules, that, can, be, realistically, subjected, to, computation, which, is, limited, by, scaling, considerations, the, computation, time, increases, as, a, power, of, the, number, of, atoms, some, view, the, birth, of, quantum, chemistry, as, starting, with, the, discovery, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, its, application, to, the, hydrogen, atom, however, a, 1927, article, of, walter, heitler, 1904, 1981, and, fritz, london, is, often, recognized, as, the, first, milestone, in, the, history, of, quantum, chemistry, this, was, the, first, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, the, diatomic, hydrogen, molecule, and, thus, to, the, phenomenon, of, the, chemical, bond, however, prior, to, this, a, critical, conceptual, framework, was, provided, by, gilbert, n, lewis, in, his, 1916, paper, the, atom, and, the, molecule, wherein, lewis, developed, the, first, working, model, of, valence, electrons, important, contributions, were, also, made, by, yoshikatsu, sugiura, and, s, c, wang, a, series, of, articles, by, linus, pauling, written, throughout, the, 1930s, integrated, the, work, of, heitler, london, sugiura, wang, lewis, and, john, c, slater, on, the, concept, of, valence, and, its, quantum, mechanical, basis, into, a, new, theoretical, framework, many, chemists, were, introduced, to, the, field, of, quantum, chemistry, by, pauling, s, 1939, text, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, and, the, structure, of, molecules, and, crystals, an, introduction, to, modern, structural, chemistry, wherein, he, summarized, this, work, referred, to, widely, now, as, valence, bond, theory, and, explained, quantum, mechanics, in, a, way, which, could, be, followed, by, chemists, the, text, soon, became, a, standard, text, at, many, universities, in, 1937, hans, hellmann, appears, to, have, been, the, first, to, publish, a, book, on, quantum, chemistry, in, the, russian, and, german, languages, in, the, years, to, follow, this, theoretical, basis, slowly, began, to, be, applied, to, chemical, structure, reactivity, and, bonding, in, addition, to, the, investigators, mentioned, above, important, progress, and, critical, contributions, were, made, in, the, early, years, of, this, field, by, irving, langmuir, robert, s, mulliken, max, born, j, robert, oppenheimer, hans, hellmann, maria, goeppert, mayer, erich, h, ckel, douglas, hartree, john, lennard, jones, and, vladimir, fock, the, electronic, structure, of, an, atom, or, molecule, is, the, quantum, state, of, its, electrons, the, first, step, in, solving, a, quantum, chemical, problem, is, usually, solving, the, schr, dinger, equation, or, dirac, equation, in, relativistic, quantum, chemistry, with, the, electronic, molecular, hamiltonian, usually, making, use, of, the, born, oppenheimer, b, o, approximation, this, is, called, determining, the, electronic, structure, of, the, molecule, an, exact, solution, for, the, non, relativistic, schr, dinger, equation, can, only, be, obtained, for, the, hydrogen, atom, though, exact, solutions, for, the, bound, state, energies, of, the, hydrogen, molecular, ion, within, the, b, o, approximation, have, been, identified, in, terms, of, the, generalized, lambert, w, function, since, all, other, atomic, and, molecular, systems, involve, the, motions, of, three, or, more, particles, their, schr, dinger, equations, cannot, be, solved, analytically, and, so, approximate, and, or, computational, solutions, must, be, sought, the, process, of, seeking, computational, solutions, to, these, problems, is, part, of, the, field, known, as, computational, chemistry, as, mentioned, above, heitler, and, london, s, method, was, extended, by, slater, and, pauling, to, become, the, valence, bond, vb, method, in, this, method, attention, is, primarily, devoted, to, the, pairwise, interactions, between, atoms, and, this, method, therefore, correlates, closely, with, classical, chemists, drawings, of, bonds, it, focuses, on, how, the, atomic, orbitals, of, an, atom, combine, to, give, individual, chemical, bonds, when, a, molecule, is, formed, incorporating, the, two, key, concepts, of, orbital, hybridization, and, resonance, an, alternative, approach, to, valence, bond, theory, was, developed, in, 1929, by, friedrich, hund, and, robert, s, mulliken, in, which, electrons, are, described, by, mathematical, functions, delocalized, over, an, entire, molecule, the, hund, mulliken, approach, or, molecular, orbital, mo, method, is, less, intuitive, to, chemists, but, has, turned, out, capable, of, predicting, spectroscopic, properties, better, than, the, vb, method, this, approach, is, the, conceptual, basis, of, the, hartree, fock, method, and, further, post, hartree, fock, methods, the, thomas, fermi, model, was, developed, independently, by, thomas, and, fermi, in, 1927, this, was, the, first, attempt, to, describe, many, electron, systems, on, the, basis, of, electronic, density, instead, of, wave, functions, although, it, was, not, very, successful, in, the, treatment, of, entire, molecules, the, method, did, provide, the, basis, for, what, is, now, known, as, density, functional, theory, dft, modern, day, dft, uses, the, kohn, sham, method, where, the, density, functional, is, split, into, four, terms, the, kohn, sham, kinetic, energy, an, external, potential, exchange, and, correlation, energies, a, large, part, of, the, focus, on, developing, dft, is, on, improving, the, exchange, and, correlation, terms, though, this, method, is, less, developed, than, post, hartree, fock, methods, its, significantly, lower, computational, requirements, scaling, typically, no, worse, than, n, 3, with, respect, to, n, basis, functions, for, the, pure, functionals, allow, it, to, tackle, larger, polyatomic, molecules, and, even, macromolecules, this, computational, affordability, and, often, comparable, accuracy, to, mp2, and, ccsd, t, post, hartree, fock, methods, has, made, it, one, of, the, most, popular, methods, in, computational, chemistry, a, further, step, can, consist, of, solving, the, schr, dinger, equation, with, the, total, molecular, hamiltonian, in, order, to, study, the, motion, of, molecules, direct, solution, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, called, quantum, dynamics, whereas, its, solution, within, the, semiclassical, approximation, is, called, semiclassical, dynamics, purely, classical, simulations, of, molecular, motion, are, referred, to, as, molecular, dynamics, md, another, approach, to, dynamics, is, a, hybrid, framework, known, as, mixed, quantum, classical, dynamics, yet, another, hybrid, framework, uses, the, feynman, path, integral, formulation, to, add, quantum, corrections, to, molecular, dynamics, which, is, called, path, integral, molecular, dynamics, statistical, approaches, using, for, example, classical, and, quantum, monte, carlo, methods, are, also, possible, and, are, particularly, useful, for, describing, equilibrium, distributions, of, states, in, adiabatic, dynamics, interatomic, interactions, are, represented, by, single, scalar, potentials, called, potential, energy, surfaces, this, is, the, born, oppenheimer, approximation, introduced, by, born, and, oppenheimer, in, 1927, pioneering, applications, of, this, in, chemistry, were, performed, by, rice, and, ramsperger, in, 1927, and, kassel, in, 1928, and, generalized, into, the, rrkm, theory, in, 1952, by, marcus, who, took, the, transition, state, theory, developed, by, eyring, in, 1935, into, account, these, methods, enable, simple, estimates, of, unimolecular, reaction, rates, from, a, few, characteristics, of, the, potential, surface, non, adiabatic, dynamics, consists, of, taking, the, interaction, between, several, coupled, potential, energy, surfaces, corresponding, to, different, electronic, quantum, states, of, the, molecule, the, coupling, terms, are, called, vibronic, couplings, the, pioneering, work, in, this, field, was, done, by, stueckelberg, landau, and, zener, in, the, 1930s, in, their, work, on, what, is, now, known, as, the, landau, zener, transition, their, formula, allows, the, transition, probability, between, two, adiabatic, potential, curves, in, the, neighborhood, of, an, avoided, crossing, to, be, calculated, spin, forbidden, reactions, are, one, type, of, non, adiabatic, reactions, where, at, least, one, change, in, spin, state, occurs, when, progressing, from, reactant, to, product
