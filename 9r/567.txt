stratigraphy, is, a, branch, of, geology, concerned, with, the, study, of, rock, layers, strata, and, layering, stratification, it, is, primarily, used, in, the, study, of, sedimentary, and, layered, volcanic, rocks, stratigraphy, has, three, related, subfields, lithostratigraphy, lithologic, stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, biologic, stratigraphy, and, chronostratigraphy, stratigraphy, by, age, catholic, priest, nicholas, steno, established, the, theoretical, basis, for, stratigraphy, when, he, introduced, the, law, of, superposition, the, principle, of, original, horizontality, and, the, principle, of, lateral, continuity, in, a, 1669, work, on, the, fossilization, of, organic, remains, in, layers, of, sediment, the, first, practical, large, scale, application, of, stratigraphy, was, by, william, smith, in, the, 1790s, and, early, 19th, century, known, as, the, father, of, english, geology, smith, recognized, the, significance, of, strata, or, rock, layering, and, the, importance, of, fossil, markers, for, correlating, strata, he, created, the, first, geologic, map, of, england, other, influential, applications, of, stratigraphy, in, the, early, 19th, century, were, by, georges, cuvier, and, alexandre, brongniart, who, studied, the, geology, of, the, region, around, paris, variation, in, rock, units, most, obviously, displayed, as, visible, layering, is, due, to, physical, contrasts, in, rock, type, lithology, this, variation, can, occur, vertically, as, layering, bedding, or, laterally, and, reflects, changes, in, environments, of, deposition, known, as, facies, change, these, variations, provide, a, lithostratigraphy, or, lithologic, stratigraphy, of, the, rock, unit, key, concepts, in, stratigraphy, involve, understanding, how, certain, geometric, relationships, between, rock, layers, arise, and, what, these, geometries, imply, about, their, original, depositional, environment, the, basic, concept, in, stratigraphy, called, the, law, of, superposition, states, in, an, undeformed, stratigraphic, sequence, the, oldest, strata, occur, at, the, base, of, the, sequence, chemostratigraphy, studies, the, changes, in, the, relative, proportions, of, trace, elements, and, isotopes, within, and, between, lithologic, units, carbon, and, oxygen, isotope, ratios, vary, with, time, and, researchers, can, use, those, to, map, subtle, changes, that, occurred, in, the, paleoenvironment, this, has, led, to, the, specialized, field, of, isotopic, stratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, documents, the, often, cyclic, changes, in, the, relative, proportions, of, minerals, particularly, carbonates, grain, size, thickness, of, sediment, layers, varves, and, fossil, diversity, with, time, related, to, seasonal, or, longer, term, changes, in, palaeoclimates, biostratigraphy, or, paleontologic, stratigraphy, is, based, on, fossil, evidence, in, the, rock, layers, strata, from, widespread, locations, containing, the, same, fossil, fauna, and, flora, are, said, to, be, correlatable, in, time, biologic, stratigraphy, was, based, on, william, smith, s, principle, of, faunal, succession, which, predated, and, was, one, of, the, first, and, most, powerful, lines, of, evidence, for, biological, evolution, it, provides, strong, evidence, for, the, formation, speciation, and, extinction, of, species, the, geologic, time, scale, was, developed, during, the, 19th, century, based, on, the, evidence, of, biologic, stratigraphy, and, faunal, succession, this, timescale, remained, a, relative, scale, until, the, development, of, radiometric, dating, which, was, based, on, an, absolute, time, framework, leading, to, the, development, of, chronostratigraphy, one, important, development, is, the, vail, curve, which, attempts, to, define, a, global, historical, sea, level, curve, according, to, inferences, from, worldwide, stratigraphic, patterns, stratigraphy, is, also, commonly, used, to, delineate, the, nature, and, extent, of, hydrocarbon, bearing, reservoir, rocks, seals, and, traps, of, petroleum, geology, chronostratigraphy, is, the, branch, of, stratigraphy, that, places, an, absolute, age, rather, than, a, relative, age, on, rock, strata, the, branch, is, concerned, with, deriving, geochronological, data, for, rock, units, both, directly, and, inferentially, so, that, a, sequence, of, time, relative, events, that, created, the, rocks, formation, can, be, derived, the, ultimate, aim, of, chronostratigraphy, is, to, place, dates, on, the, sequence, of, deposition, of, all, rocks, within, a, geological, region, and, then, to, every, region, and, by, extension, to, provide, an, entire, geologic, record, of, the, earth, a, gap, or, missing, strata, in, the, geological, record, of, an, area, is, called, a, stratigraphic, hiatus, this, may, be, the, result, of, a, halt, in, the, deposition, of, sediment, alternatively, the, gap, may, be, due, to, removal, by, erosion, in, which, case, it, may, be, called, a, stratigraphic, vacuity, it, is, called, a, hiatus, because, deposition, was, on, hold, for, a, period, of, time, a, physical, gap, may, represent, both, a, period, of, non, deposition, and, a, period, of, erosion, a, geologic, fault, may, cause, the, appearance, of, a, hiatus, magnetostratigraphy, is, a, chronostratigraphic, technique, used, to, date, sedimentary, and, volcanic, sequences, the, method, works, by, collecting, oriented, samples, at, measured, intervals, throughout, a, section, the, samples, are, analyzed, to, determine, their, detrital, remanent, magnetism, drm, that, is, the, polarity, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, the, time, a, stratum, was, deposited, for, sedimentary, rocks, this, is, possible, because, as, they, fall, through, the, water, column, very, fine, grained, magnetic, minerals, 17, m, behave, like, tiny, compasses, orienting, themselves, with, earth, s, magnetic, field, upon, burial, that, orientation, is, preserved, for, volcanic, rocks, magnetic, minerals, which, form, in, the, melt, orient, themselves, with, the, ambient, magnetic, field, and, are, fixed, in, place, upon, crystallization, of, the, lava, oriented, paleomagnetic, core, samples, are, collected, in, the, field, mudstones, siltstones, and, very, fine, grained, sandstones, are, the, preferred, lithologies, because, the, magnetic, grains, are, finer, and, more, likely, to, orient, with, the, ambient, field, during, deposition, if, the, ancient, magnetic, field, were, oriented, similar, to, today, s, field, north, magnetic, pole, near, the, north, rotational, pole, the, strata, would, retain, a, normal, polarity, if, the, data, indicate, that, the, north, magnetic, pole, were, near, the, south, rotational, pole, the, strata, would, exhibit, reversed, polarity, results, of, the, individual, samples, are, analyzed, by, removing, the, natural, remanent, magnetization, nrm, to, reveal, the, drm, following, statistical, analysis, the, results, are, used, to, generate, a, local, magnetostratigraphic, column, that, can, then, be, compared, against, the, global, magnetic, polarity, time, scale, this, technique, is, used, to, date, sequences, that, generally, lack, fossils, or, interbedded, igneous, rocks, the, continuous, nature, of, the, sampling, means, that, it, is, also, a, powerful, technique, for, the, estimation, of, sediment, accumulation, rates
