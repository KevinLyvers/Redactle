the, sulfate, or, sulphate, ion, is, a, polyatomic, anion, with, the, empirical, formula, so, 2, 4, salts, acid, derivatives, and, peroxides, of, sulfate, are, widely, used, in, industry, sulfates, occur, widely, in, everyday, life, sulfates, are, salts, of, sulfuric, acid, and, many, are, prepared, from, that, acid, sulfate, is, the, spelling, recommended, by, iupac, but, sulphate, was, traditionally, used, in, british, english, the, sulfate, anion, consists, of, a, central, sulfur, atom, surrounded, by, four, equivalent, oxygen, atoms, in, a, tetrahedral, arrangement, the, symmetry, of, the, isolated, anion, is, the, same, as, that, of, methane, the, sulfur, atom, is, in, the, 6, oxidation, state, while, the, four, oxygen, atoms, are, each, in, the, 2, state, the, sulfate, ion, carries, an, overall, charge, of, 2, and, it, is, the, conjugate, base, of, the, bisulfate, or, hydrogensulfate, ion, hso, 4, which, is, in, turn, the, conjugate, base, of, h, 2, so, 4, sulfuric, acid, organic, sulfate, esters, such, as, dimethyl, sulfate, are, covalent, compounds, and, esters, of, sulfuric, acid, the, tetrahedral, molecular, geometry, of, the, sulfate, ion, is, as, predicted, by, vsepr, theory, the, first, description, of, the, bonding, in, modern, terms, was, by, gilbert, lewis, in, his, groundbreaking, paper, of, 1916, where, he, described, the, bonding, in, terms, of, electron, octets, around, each, atom, that, is, no, double, bonds, and, a, formal, charge, of, 2, on, the, sulfur, atom, and, 1, on, each, oxygen, atom, later, linus, pauling, used, valence, bond, theory, to, propose, that, the, most, significant, resonance, canonicals, had, two, pi, bonds, involving, d, orbitals, his, reasoning, was, that, the, charge, on, sulfur, was, thus, reduced, in, accordance, with, his, principle, of, electroneutrality, the, s, o, bond, length, of, 149, pm, is, shorter, than, the, bond, lengths, in, sulfuric, acid, of, 157, pm, for, s, oh, the, double, bonding, was, taken, by, pauling, to, account, for, the, shortness, of, the, s, o, bond, pauling, s, use, of, d, orbitals, provoked, a, debate, on, the, relative, importance, of, pi, bonding, and, bond, polarity, electrostatic, attraction, in, causing, the, shortening, of, the, s, o, bond, the, outcome, was, a, broad, consensus, that, d, orbitals, play, a, role, but, are, not, as, significant, as, pauling, had, believed, a, widely, accepted, description, involving, p, d, bonding, was, initially, proposed, by, durward, william, john, cruickshank, in, this, model, fully, occupied, p, orbitals, on, oxygen, overlap, with, empty, sulfur, d, orbitals, principally, the, d, z, 2, and, d, x, 2, y, 2, however, in, this, description, despite, there, being, some, character, to, the, s, o, bonds, the, bond, has, significant, ionic, character, for, sulfuric, acid, computational, analysis, with, natural, bond, orbitals, confirms, a, clear, positive, charge, on, sulfur, theoretically, 2, 45, and, a, low, 3d, occupancy, therefore, the, representation, with, four, single, bonds, is, the, optimal, lewis, structure, rather, than, the, one, with, two, double, bonds, thus, the, lewis, model, not, the, pauling, model, in, this, model, the, structure, obeys, the, octet, rule, and, the, charge, distribution, is, in, agreement, with, the, electronegativity, of, the, atoms, the, discrepancy, between, the, s, o, bond, length, in, the, sulfate, ion, and, the, s, oh, bond, length, in, sulfuric, acid, is, explained, by, donation, of, p, orbital, electrons, from, the, terminal, s, o, bonds, in, sulfuric, acid, into, the, antibonding, s, oh, orbitals, weakening, them, resulting, in, the, longer, bond, length, of, the, latter, however, pauling, s, representation, for, sulfate, and, other, main, group, compounds, with, oxygen, is, still, a, common, way, of, representing, the, bonding, in, many, textbooks, the, apparent, contradiction, can, be, clarified, if, one, realizes, that, the, covalent, double, bonds, in, the, lewis, structure, actually, represent, bonds, that, are, strongly, polarized, by, more, than, 90, towards, the, oxygen, atom, on, the, other, hand, in, the, structure, with, a, dipolar, bond, the, charge, is, localized, as, a, lone, pair, on, the, oxygen, typically, metal, sulfates, are, prepared, by, treating, metal, oxides, metal, carbonates, or, the, metal, itself, with, sulfuric, acid, although, written, with, simple, anhydrous, formulas, these, conversions, generally, are, conducted, in, the, presence, of, water, consequently, the, product, sulfates, are, hydrated, corresponding, to, zinc, sulfate, znso, 4, 7h, 2, o, copper, ii, sulfate, cuso, 4, 5h, 2, o, and, cadmium, sulfate, cdso, 4, h, 2, o, some, metal, sulfides, can, be, oxidized, to, give, metal, sulfates, there, are, numerous, examples, of, ionic, sulfates, many, of, which, are, highly, soluble, in, water, exceptions, include, calcium, sulfate, strontium, sulfate, lead, ii, sulfate, barium, sulfate, silver, sulfate, and, mercury, sulfate, which, are, poorly, soluble, radium, sulfate, is, the, most, insoluble, sulfate, known, the, barium, derivative, is, useful, in, the, gravimetric, analysis, of, sulfate, if, one, adds, a, solution, of, most, barium, salts, for, instance, barium, chloride, to, a, solution, containing, sulfate, ions, barium, sulfate, will, precipitate, out, of, solution, as, a, whitish, powder, this, is, a, common, laboratory, test, to, determine, if, sulfate, anions, are, present, the, sulfate, ion, can, act, as, a, ligand, attaching, either, by, one, oxygen, monodentate, or, by, two, oxygens, as, either, a, chelate, or, a, bridge, an, example, is, the, complex, co, en, 2, so, 4, br, or, the, neutral, metal, complex, pt, so, 4, pph, 3, 2, where, the, sulfate, ion, is, acting, as, a, bidentate, ligand, the, metal, oxygen, bonds, in, sulfate, complexes, can, have, significant, covalent, character, sulfates, are, widely, used, industrially, major, compounds, include, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, some, anaerobic, microorganisms, such, as, those, living, in, sediment, or, near, deep, sea, thermal, vents, use, the, reduction, of, sulfates, coupled, with, the, oxidation, of, organic, compounds, or, hydrogen, as, an, energy, source, for, chemosynthesis, some, sulfates, were, known, to, alchemists, the, vitriol, salts, from, the, latin, vitreolum, glassy, were, so, called, because, they, were, some, of, the, first, transparent, crystals, known, green, vitriol, is, iron, ii, sulfate, heptahydrate, feso, 4, 7h, 2, o, blue, vitriol, is, copper, ii, sulfate, pentahydrate, cuso, 4, 5h, 2, o, and, white, vitriol, is, zinc, sulfate, heptahydrate, znso, 4, 7h, 2, o, alum, a, double, sulfate, of, potassium, and, aluminium, with, the, formula, k, 2, al, 2, so, 4, 4, 24h, 2, o, figured, in, the, development, of, the, chemical, industry, sulfates, occur, as, microscopic, particles, aerosols, resulting, from, fossil, fuel, and, biomass, combustion, they, increase, the, acidity, of, the, atmosphere, and, form, acid, rain, the, anaerobic, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, desulfovibrio, desulfuricans, and, d, vulgaris, can, remove, the, black, sulfate, crust, that, often, tarnishes, buildings, after, 1990, the, global, dimming, trend, had, clearly, switched, to, global, brightening, this, followed, measures, taken, to, combat, air, pollution, by, the, developed, nations, typically, through, flue, gas, desulfurization, installations, at, thermal, power, plants, such, as, wet, scrubbers, or, fluidized, bed, combustion, in, the, united, states, sulfate, aerosols, have, declined, significantly, since, 1970, with, the, passage, of, the, clean, air, act, which, was, strengthened, in, 1977, and, 1990, according, to, the, epa, from, 1970, to, 2005, total, emissions, of, the, six, principal, air, pollutants, including, sulfates, dropped, by, 53, in, the, us, by, 2010, this, reduction, in, sulfate, pollution, led, to, estimated, healthcare, cost, savings, valued, at, 50, billion, annually, similar, measures, were, taken, in, europe, such, as, the, 1985, helsinki, protocol, on, the, reduction, of, sulfur, emissions, under, the, convention, on, long, range, transboundary, air, pollution, and, with, similar, improvements, since, changes, in, aerosol, concentrations, already, have, an, impact, on, the, global, climate, they, would, necessarily, influence, future, projections, as, well, in, fact, it, is, impossible, to, fully, estimate, the, warming, impact, of, all, greenhouse, gases, without, accounting, for, the, counteracting, cooling, from, aerosols, regardless, of, the, current, strength, of, aerosol, cooling, all, future, climate, change, scenarios, project, decreases, in, particulates, and, this, includes, the, scenarios, where, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, and, 2, c, 3, 6, f, targets, are, met, their, specific, emission, reduction, targets, assume, the, need, to, make, up, for, lower, dimming, since, models, estimate, that, the, cooling, caused, by, sulfates, is, largely, equivalent, to, the, warming, caused, by, atmospheric, methane, and, since, methane, is, a, relatively, short, lived, greenhouse, gas, it, is, believed, that, simultaneous, reductions, in, both, would, effectively, cancel, each, other, out, on, regional, and, global, scale, air, pollution, can, affect, the, water, cycle, in, a, manner, similar, to, some, natural, processes, one, example, is, the, impact, of, sahara, dust, on, hurricane, formation, air, laden, with, sand, and, mineral, particles, moves, over, the, atlantic, ocean, where, they, block, some, of, the, sunlight, from, reaching, the, water, surface, slightly, cooling, it, and, dampening, the, development, of, hurricanes, likewise, it, has, been, suggested, since, the, early, 2000s, that, since, aerosols, decrease, solar, radiation, over, the, ocean, and, hence, reduce, evaporation, from, it, they, would, be, spinning, down, the, hydrological, cycle, of, the, planet, the, hydrogensulfate, ion, hso, 4, also, called, the, bisulfate, ion, is, the, conjugate, base, of, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, sulfuric, acid, is, classified, as, a, strong, acid, in, aqueous, solutions, it, ionizes, completely, to, form, hydronium, h, 3, o, and, hydrogensulfate, hso, 4, ions, in, other, words, the, sulfuric, acid, behaves, as, a, br, nsted, lowry, acid, and, is, deprotonated, to, form, hydrogensulfate, ion, hydrogensulfate, has, a, valency, of, 1, an, example, of, a, salt, containing, the, hso, 4, ion, is, sodium, bisulfate, nahso, 4, in, dilute, solutions, the, hydrogensulfate, ions, also, dissociate, forming, more, hydronium, ions, and, sulfate, ions, so, 2, 4
