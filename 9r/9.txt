scientific, modelling, is, an, activity, that, produces, models, representing, empirical, objects, phenomena, and, physical, processes, to, make, a, particular, part, or, feature, of, the, world, easier, to, understand, define, quantify, visualize, or, simulate, it, requires, selecting, and, identifying, relevant, aspects, of, a, situation, in, the, real, world, and, then, developing, a, model, to, replicate, a, system, with, those, features, different, types, of, models, may, be, used, for, different, purposes, such, as, conceptual, models, to, better, understand, operational, models, to, operationalize, mathematical, models, to, quantify, computational, models, to, simulate, and, graphical, models, to, visualize, the, subject, modelling, is, an, essential, and, inseparable, part, of, many, scientific, disciplines, each, of, which, has, its, own, ideas, about, specific, types, of, modelling, the, following, was, said, by, john, von, neumann, the, sciences, do, not, try, to, explain, they, hardly, even, try, to, interpret, they, mainly, make, models, by, a, model, is, meant, a, mathematical, construct, which, with, the, addition, of, certain, verbal, interpretations, describes, observed, phenomena, the, justification, of, such, a, mathematical, construct, is, solely, and, precisely, that, it, is, expected, to, work, that, is, correctly, to, describe, phenomena, from, a, reasonably, wide, area, there, is, also, an, increasing, attention, to, scientific, modelling, in, fields, such, as, science, education, philosophy, of, science, systems, theory, and, knowledge, visualization, there, is, a, growing, collection, of, methods, techniques, and, meta, theory, about, all, kinds, of, specialized, scientific, modelling, a, scientific, model, seeks, to, represent, empirical, objects, phenomena, and, physical, processes, in, a, logical, and, objective, way, all, models, are, in, simulacra, that, is, simplified, reflections, of, reality, that, despite, being, approximations, can, be, extremely, useful, building, and, disputing, models, is, fundamental, to, the, scientific, enterprise, complete, and, true, representation, may, be, impossible, but, scientific, debate, often, concerns, which, is, the, better, model, for, a, given, task, e, g, which, is, the, more, accurate, climate, model, for, seasonal, forecasting, attempts, to, formalize, the, principles, of, the, empirical, sciences, use, an, interpretation, to, model, reality, in, the, same, way, logicians, axiomatize, the, principles, of, logic, the, aim, of, these, attempts, is, to, construct, a, formal, system, that, will, not, produce, theoretical, consequences, that, are, contrary, to, what, is, found, in, reality, predictions, or, other, statements, drawn, from, such, a, formal, system, mirror, or, map, the, real, world, only, insofar, as, these, scientific, models, are, true, for, the, scientist, a, model, is, also, a, way, in, which, the, human, thought, processes, can, be, amplified, for, instance, models, that, are, rendered, in, software, allow, scientists, to, leverage, computational, power, to, simulate, visualize, manipulate, and, gain, intuition, about, the, entity, phenomenon, or, process, being, represented, such, computer, models, are, in, silico, other, types, of, scientific, models, are, in, vivo, living, models, such, as, laboratory, rats, and, in, vitro, in, glassware, such, as, tissue, culture, models, are, typically, used, when, it, is, either, impossible, or, impractical, to, create, experimental, conditions, in, which, scientists, can, directly, measure, outcomes, direct, measurement, of, outcomes, under, controlled, conditions, see, scientific, method, will, always, be, more, reliable, than, modeled, estimates, of, outcomes, within, modeling, and, simulation, a, model, is, a, task, driven, purposeful, simplification, and, abstraction, of, a, perception, of, reality, shaped, by, physical, legal, and, cognitive, constraints, it, is, task, driven, because, a, model, is, captured, with, a, certain, question, or, task, in, mind, simplifications, leave, all, the, known, and, observed, entities, and, their, relation, out, that, are, not, important, for, the, task, abstraction, aggregates, information, that, is, important, but, not, needed, in, the, same, detail, as, the, object, of, interest, both, activities, simplification, and, abstraction, are, done, purposefully, however, they, are, done, based, on, a, perception, of, reality, this, perception, is, already, a, model, in, itself, as, it, comes, with, a, physical, constraint, there, are, also, constraints, on, what, we, are, able, to, legally, observe, with, our, current, tools, and, methods, and, cognitive, constraints, that, limit, what, we, are, able, to, explain, with, our, current, theories, this, model, comprises, the, concepts, their, behavior, and, their, relations, informal, form, and, is, often, referred, to, as, a, conceptual, model, in, order, to, execute, the, model, it, needs, to, be, implemented, as, a, computer, simulation, this, requires, more, choices, such, as, numerical, approximations, or, the, use, of, heuristics, despite, all, these, epistemological, and, computational, constraints, simulation, has, been, recognized, as, the, third, pillar, of, scientific, methods, theory, building, simulation, and, experimentation, a, simulation, is, a, way, to, implement, the, model, often, employed, when, the, model, is, too, complex, for, the, analytical, solution, a, steady, state, simulation, provides, information, about, the, system, at, a, specific, instant, in, time, usually, at, equilibrium, if, such, a, state, exists, a, dynamic, simulation, provides, information, over, time, a, simulation, shows, how, a, particular, object, or, phenomenon, will, behave, such, a, simulation, can, be, useful, for, testing, analysis, or, training, in, those, cases, where, real, world, systems, or, concepts, can, be, represented, by, models, structure, is, a, fundamental, and, sometimes, intangible, notion, covering, the, recognition, observation, nature, and, stability, of, patterns, and, relationships, of, entities, from, a, child, s, verbal, description, of, a, snowflake, to, the, detailed, scientific, analysis, of, the, properties, of, magnetic, fields, the, concept, of, structure, is, an, essential, foundation, of, nearly, every, mode, of, inquiry, and, discovery, in, science, philosophy, and, art, a, system, is, a, set, of, interacting, or, interdependent, entities, real, or, abstract, forming, an, integrated, whole, in, general, a, system, is, a, construct, or, collection, of, different, elements, that, together, can, produce, results, not, obtainable, by, the, elements, alone, the, concept, of, an, integrated, whole, can, also, be, stated, in, terms, of, a, system, embodying, a, set, of, relationships, which, are, differentiated, from, relationships, of, the, set, to, other, elements, and, form, relationships, between, an, element, of, the, set, and, elements, not, a, part, of, the, relational, regime, there, are, two, types, of, system, models, 1, discrete, in, which, the, variables, change, instantaneously, at, separate, points, in, time, and, 2, continuous, where, the, state, variables, change, continuously, with, respect, to, time, modelling, is, the, process, of, generating, a, model, as, a, conceptual, representation, of, some, phenomenon, typically, a, model, will, deal, with, only, some, aspects, of, the, phenomenon, in, question, and, two, models, of, the, same, phenomenon, may, be, essentially, different, that, is, to, say, that, the, differences, between, them, comprise, more, than, just, a, simple, renaming, of, components, such, differences, may, be, due, to, differing, requirements, of, the, model, s, end, users, or, to, conceptual, or, aesthetic, differences, among, the, modelers, and, to, contingent, decisions, made, during, the, modelling, process, considerations, that, may, influence, the, structure, of, a, model, might, be, the, modeler, s, preference, for, a, reduced, ontology, preferences, regarding, statistical, models, versus, deterministic, models, discrete, versus, continuous, time, etc, in, any, case, users, of, a, model, need, to, understand, the, assumptions, made, that, are, pertinent, to, its, validity, for, a, given, use, building, a, model, requires, abstraction, assumptions, are, used, in, modelling, in, order, to, specify, the, domain, of, application, of, the, model, for, example, the, special, theory, of, relativity, assumes, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, this, assumption, was, contextualized, and, further, explained, by, the, general, theory, of, relativity, a, model, makes, accurate, predictions, when, its, assumptions, are, valid, and, might, well, not, make, accurate, predictions, when, its, assumptions, do, not, hold, such, assumptions, are, often, the, point, with, which, older, theories, are, succeeded, by, new, ones, the, general, theory, of, relativity, works, in, non, inertial, reference, frames, as, well, a, model, is, evaluated, first, and, foremost, by, its, consistency, to, empirical, data, any, model, inconsistent, with, reproducible, observations, must, be, modified, or, rejected, one, way, to, modify, the, model, is, by, restricting, the, domain, over, which, it, is, credited, with, having, high, validity, a, case, in, point, is, newtonian, physics, which, is, highly, useful, except, for, the, very, small, the, very, fast, and, the, very, massive, phenomena, of, the, universe, however, a, fit, to, empirical, data, alone, is, not, sufficient, for, a, model, to, be, accepted, as, valid, factors, important, in, evaluating, a, model, include, people, may, attempt, to, quantify, the, evaluation, of, a, model, using, a, utility, function, visualization, is, any, technique, for, creating, images, diagrams, or, animations, to, communicate, a, message, visualization, through, visual, imagery, has, been, an, effective, way, to, communicate, both, abstract, and, concrete, ideas, since, the, dawn, of, man, examples, from, history, include, cave, paintings, egyptian, hieroglyphs, greek, geometry, and, leonardo, da, vinci, s, revolutionary, methods, of, technical, drawing, for, engineering, and, scientific, purposes, space, mapping, refers, to, a, methodology, that, employs, a, quasi, global, modelling, formulation, to, link, companion, coarse, ideal, or, low, fidelity, with, fine, practical, or, high, fidelity, models, of, different, complexities, in, engineering, optimization, space, mapping, aligns, maps, a, very, fast, coarse, model, with, its, related, expensive, to, compute, fine, model, so, as, to, avoid, direct, expensive, optimization, of, the, fine, model, the, alignment, process, iteratively, refines, a, mapped, coarse, model, surrogate, model, one, application, of, scientific, modelling, is, the, field, of, modelling, and, simulation, generally, referred, to, as, m, s, m, s, has, a, spectrum, of, applications, which, range, from, concept, development, and, analysis, through, experimentation, measurement, and, verification, to, disposal, analysis, projects, and, programs, may, use, hundreds, of, different, simulations, simulators, and, model, analysis, tools, the, figure, shows, how, modelling, and, simulation, is, used, as, a, central, part, of, an, integrated, program, in, a, defence, capability, development, process, nowadays, there, are, some, 40, magazines, about, scientific, modelling, which, offer, all, kinds, of, international, forums, since, the, 1960s, there, is, a, strongly, growing, number, of, books, and, magazines, about, specific, forms, of, scientific, modelling, there, is, also, a, lot, of, discussion, about, scientific, modelling, in, the, philosophy, of, science, literature, a, selection
