in, geography, the, temperate, climates, of, earth, occur, in, the, middle, latitudes, approximately, 23, 5, to, 66, 5, n, s, of, equator, which, span, between, the, tropics, and, the, polar, regions, of, earth, these, zones, generally, have, wider, temperature, ranges, throughout, the, year, and, more, distinct, seasonal, changes, compared, to, tropical, climates, where, such, variations, are, often, small, they, usually, differ, only, in, the, amount, of, precipitation, in, temperate, climates, not, only, do, latitudinal, positions, influence, temperature, changes, but, various, sea, currents, prevailing, wind, direction, continentality, how, large, a, landmass, is, and, altitude, also, shape, temperate, climates, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, defines, a, climate, as, temperate, c, when, the, mean, temperature, is, above, 3, c, 26, 6, f, but, below, 18, c, 64, 4, f, in, the, coldest, month, to, account, for, the, persistence, of, frost, however, some, adaptations, of, k, ppen, set, the, minimum, at, 0, c, 32, 0, f, continental, climates, are, classified, as, d, and, considered, to, be, varieties, of, temperate, climates, having, more, extreme, temperatures, with, mean, temperatures, in, the, coldest, month, usually, being, below, 3, c, 26, 6, f, the, north, temperate, zone, extends, from, the, tropic, of, cancer, approximately, 23, 5, north, latitude, to, the, arctic, circle, approximately, 66, 5, north, latitude, the, south, temperate, zone, extends, from, the, tropic, of, capricorn, approximately, 23, 5, south, latitude, to, the, antarctic, circle, at, approximately, 66, 5, south, latitude, in, some, climate, classifications, the, temperate, zone, may, be, divided, into, several, smaller, climate, zones, based, on, monthly, temperatures, the, coldest, month, and, rainfall, these, can, include, the, subtropical, zone, humid, subtropical, and, mediterranean, climate, and, the, cool, temperate, zone, oceanic, and, continental, climates, these, are, the, climates, that, are, typically, found, toward, the, more, equatorial, portion, of, the, temperate, zone, between, 23, 5, and, 35, north, or, south, and, thus, are, far, more, influenced, by, the, tropics, than, any, other, temperate, climate, type, usually, having, warmer, temperatures, over, the, year, longer, and, hot, summers, and, shorter, mild, winters, freezing, precipitation, is, uncommon, in, this, portion, of, the, temperate, zone, humid, subtropical, climates, generally, have, long, hot, and, humid, summers, with, frequent, convective, showers, in, summer, and, a, peak, seasonal, rainfall, in, the, hottest, months, winters, are, normally, mild, and, above, freezing, in, the, humid, subtropics, warm, ocean, currents, are, usually, found, in, coastal, areas, with, humid, subtropical, climates, this, type, of, climate, is, normally, located, along, leeward, lower, east, coasts, of, continents, such, as, in, southeast, and, central, argentina, uruguay, and, south, of, brazil, the, southeast, portions, of, east, asia, southern, and, portions, of, the, northeast, and, midwestern, united, states, and, portions, of, south, africa, ethiopia, and, eastern, australia, in, some, areas, with, a, humid, subtropical, climate, most, notably, southeast, china, and, north, india, there, is, an, even, sharper, wet, dry, season, called, a, monsoon, subtropical, climate, or, subtropical, monsoon, cwa, in, these, regions, winters, are, quite, chilly, and, dry, and, summers, have, very, heavy, rainfall, some, cwa, areas, in, southern, china, report, more, than, 80, of, annual, precipitation, in, the, five, warmest, months, southwest, monsoon, mediterranean, climates, have, the, opposite, rainfall, pattern, to, dry, winter, climates, with, a, dry, summer, and, wet, winter, this, climate, occurs, mostly, at, the, western, edges, and, coasts, of, the, continents, and, are, bounded, by, arid, deserts, on, their, equatorward, sides, that, brings, dry, winds, causing, the, dry, season, of, summer, and, oceanic, climates, to, the, poleward, sides, that, are, influenced, by, cool, ocean, currents, and, air, masses, that, bring, the, rainfall, of, winter, the, five, main, mediterranean, regions, of, the, world, are, the, mediterranean, basin, in, north, africa, southern, europe, and, west, asia, coastal, california, in, the, united, states, the, south, and, west, states, of, australia, the, western, cape, of, south, africa, and, the, south, and, southwestern, coast, of, chile, subtropical, highland, climates, are, climate, variants, often, grouped, together, with, oceanic, climates, found, in, some, mountainous, areas, of, either, the, tropics, or, subtropics, they, have, characteristically, mild, temperatures, year, round, featuring, the, four, seasons, in, the, subtropics, and, no, marked, seasons, in, the, tropics, the, latter, usually, remaining, mild, to, cool, through, most, of, the, year, subtropical, highland, climates, under, the, cfb, classification, usually, have, rainfall, spread, relatively, evenly, in, all, months, of, the, year, similar, to, most, oceanic, climates, while, climates, under, the, cwb, classification, have, significant, monsoon, influence, usually, having, dry, winters, and, wet, summers, these, climates, occur, in, the, middle, latitudes, between, approximately, 35, and, 66, 5, north, and, south, of, the, equator, there, is, an, equal, climatic, influence, from, both, the, polar, and, tropical, zones, in, this, climate, region, two, types, of, climates, are, in, this, zone, a, milder, oceanic, one, and, more, severe, seasonal, continental, one, most, prototypical, temperate, climates, have, a, distinct, four, season, pattern, especially, in, the, continental, climate, sector, oceanic, climates, are, created, by, the, on, shore, flow, from, the, cool, high, latitude, oceans, to, their, west, this, causes, the, climate, to, have, mild, summers, and, cool, but, not, cold, winters, and, relative, humidity, and, precipitation, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, year, these, climates, are, frequently, cloudy, and, cool, and, winters, are, milder, than, those, in, the, continental, climate, regions, with, oceanic, climates, include, northwestern, europe, northwestern, north, america, southeastern, and, southwestern, south, america, southeastern, australia, and, most, of, new, zealand, humid, continental, climates, are, considered, as, a, variety, of, temperate, climates, due, to, lying, in, the, temperate, zones, although, they, are, classified, separately, from, other, temperate, climates, in, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, in, contrast, to, oceanic, climates, they, are, created, by, large, land, masses, and, seasonal, changes, in, wind, direction, this, causes, humid, continental, climates, to, have, severe, temperatures, for, the, season, compared, to, other, temperate, climates, meaning, a, hot, summer, and, cold, winter, precipitation, may, be, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, year, while, in, some, locations, there, is, a, summer, accent, on, rainfall, regions, with, humid, continental, climates, include, southeastern, canada, the, upper, portions, of, the, eastern, united, states, portions, of, eastern, europe, parts, of, china, japan, and, the, korean, peninsula, these, are, temperate, climates, that, compared, to, the, subtropics, are, on, the, poleward, edge, of, the, temperate, zone, therefore, they, still, have, four, marked, seasons, including, a, warmer, one, but, are, far, more, influenced, by, the, polar, zones, than, any, other, but, the, very, polar, climates, tundra, and, ice, cap, climate, areas, with, subpolar, oceanic, climates, feature, an, oceanic, climate, but, are, usually, located, closer, to, polar, regions, as, a, result, of, their, location, these, regions, tend, to, be, on, the, cool, end, of, oceanic, climates, snowfall, tends, to, be, more, common, here, than, in, other, oceanic, climates, subpolar, oceanic, climates, are, less, prone, to, temperature, extremes, than, subarctic, climates, or, continental, climates, featuring, milder, winters, than, these, climates, but, still, with, similar, summers, this, variant, of, an, oceanic, climate, is, found, in, parts, of, coastal, iceland, the, faroe, islands, parts, of, scotland, northwestern, coastal, areas, of, norway, such, as, lofoten, and, reaching, to, 70, north, on, some, islands, uplands, near, the, coast, of, southwestern, norway, the, aleutian, islands, of, alaska, and, northern, parts, of, the, alaskan, panhandle, some, parts, of, southern, argentina, and, chile, though, most, regions, are, still, classified, as, continental, subantarctic, and, a, few, highland, areas, of, tasmania, the, australian, alps, and, southern, alps, of, new, zealand, this, type, of, climate, is, even, found, in, tropical, areas, such, as, the, papuan, highlands, in, indonesia, cfc, is, the, categorization, for, this, regime, even, in, the, middle, of, summer, temperatures, exceeding, 20, c, 68, f, are, exceptional, weather, events, in, the, most, maritime, of, those, locations, impacted, by, this, regime, in, some, parts, of, this, climate, temperatures, as, high, as, 30, c, 86, f, have, been, recorded, on, rare, occasions, while, temperatures, as, low, as, 15, c, 5, f, have, still, been, recorded, on, rare, occasions, a, cold, variant, of, the, monsoon, influenced, subtropical, highland, climate, similar, to, subpolar, oceanic, climates, occurs, in, small, areas, in, yunnan, sichuan, and, parts, of, the, altiplano, between, bolivia, peru, and, chile, where, summers, are, sufficiently, short, to, be, cwc, with, fewer, than, four, months, over, 10, c, 50, f, due, to, the, high, altitudes, at, these, locations, el, alto, bolivia, is, one, of, the, few, confirmed, towns, that, features, this, variation, of, the, subtropical, highland, climate, cold, summer, mediterranean, climates, csc, are, present, in, high, elevation, areas, around, coastal, csb, climate, areas, where, the, strong, maritime, influence, prevents, the, average, winter, monthly, temperature, from, dropping, below, 0, c, despite, the, maritime, influence, they, are, classified, alongside, other, mediterranean, climates, in, the, k, ppen, classification, rather, than, oceanic, climates, like, subtropical, highland, climates, due, to, the, opposite, rainfall, pattern, this, climate, is, rare, and, is, predominantly, found, in, climate, fringes, and, isolated, areas, of, the, cascades, and, andes, mountains, as, the, dry, summer, climate, extends, further, poleward, in, the, americas, than, elsewhere, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, human, population, resides, in, temperate, zones, especially, in, the, northern, hemisphere, due, to, its, greater, mass, of, land, and, lack, of, extreme, temperatures, the, biggest, described, number, of, taxa, in, a, temperate, region, is, found, in, southern, africa, where, some, 24, 000, taxa, species, and, infraspecific, taxa, have, been, described, farming, is, a, large, scale, practice, in, the, temperate, regions, except, for, boreal, subarctic, regions, due, to, the, plentiful, rainfall, and, warm, summers, because, most, agricultural, activity, occurs, in, the, spring, and, summer, cold, winters, have, a, small, effect, on, agricultural, production, extreme, winters, or, summers, have, a, huge, impact, on, the, productivity, of, agriculture, which, is, less, common, temperate, regions, have, the, majority, of, the, world, s, population, which, leads, to, large, cities, there, are, a, couple, of, factors, why, the, climate, of, large, city, landscapes, differs, from, the, climate, of, rural, areas, one, factor, is, the, strength, of, the, absorption, rate, of, buildings, and, asphalt, which, is, higher, than, that, of, natural, land, the, other, large, factor, is, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, from, buildings, and, vehicles, these, factors, have, led, to, the, average, climate, of, cities, to, be, warmer, than, surrounding, areas
