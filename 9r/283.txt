nuclear, chemistry, is, the, sub, field, of, chemistry, dealing, with, radioactivity, nuclear, processes, and, transformations, in, the, nuclei, of, atoms, such, as, nuclear, transmutation, and, nuclear, properties, it, is, the, chemistry, of, radioactive, elements, such, as, the, actinides, radium, and, radon, together, with, the, chemistry, associated, with, equipment, such, as, nuclear, reactors, which, are, designed, to, perform, nuclear, processes, this, includes, the, corrosion, of, surfaces, and, the, behavior, under, conditions, of, both, normal, and, abnormal, operation, such, as, during, an, accident, an, important, area, is, the, behavior, of, objects, and, materials, after, being, placed, into, a, nuclear, waste, storage, or, disposal, site, it, includes, the, study, of, the, chemical, effects, resulting, from, the, absorption, of, radiation, within, living, animals, plants, and, other, materials, the, radiation, chemistry, controls, much, of, radiation, biology, as, radiation, has, an, effect, on, living, things, at, the, molecular, scale, to, explain, it, another, way, the, radiation, alters, the, biochemicals, within, an, organism, the, alteration, of, the, bio, molecules, then, changes, the, chemistry, which, occurs, within, the, organism, this, change, in, chemistry, then, can, lead, to, a, biological, outcome, as, a, result, nuclear, chemistry, greatly, assists, the, understanding, of, medical, treatments, such, as, cancer, radiotherapy, and, has, enabled, these, treatments, to, improve, it, includes, the, study, of, the, production, and, use, of, radioactive, sources, for, a, range, of, processes, these, include, radiotherapy, in, medical, applications, the, use, of, radioactive, tracers, within, industry, science, and, the, environment, and, the, use, of, radiation, to, modify, materials, such, as, polymers, it, also, includes, the, study, and, use, of, nuclear, processes, in, non, radioactive, areas, of, human, activity, for, instance, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, spectroscopy, is, commonly, used, in, synthetic, organic, chemistry, and, physical, chemistry, and, for, structural, analysis, in, macro, molecular, chemistry, after, wilhelm, r, ntgen, discovered, x, rays, in, 1895, many, scientists, began, to, work, on, ionizing, radiation, one, of, these, was, henri, becquerel, who, investigated, the, relationship, between, phosphorescence, and, the, blackening, of, photographic, plates, when, becquerel, working, in, france, discovered, that, with, no, external, source, of, energy, the, uranium, generated, rays, which, could, blacken, or, fog, the, photographic, plate, radioactivity, was, discovered, marie, sk, odowska, curie, working, in, paris, and, her, husband, pierre, curie, isolated, two, new, radioactive, elements, from, uranium, ore, they, used, radiometric, methods, to, identify, which, stream, the, radioactivity, was, in, after, each, chemical, separation, they, separated, the, uranium, ore, into, each, of, the, different, chemical, elements, that, were, known, at, the, time, and, measured, the, radioactivity, of, each, fraction, they, then, attempted, to, separate, these, radioactive, fractions, further, to, isolate, a, smaller, fraction, with, a, higher, specific, activity, radioactivity, divided, by, mass, in, this, way, they, isolated, polonium, and, radium, it, was, noticed, in, about, 1901, that, high, doses, of, radiation, could, cause, an, injury, in, humans, henri, becquerel, had, carried, a, sample, of, radium, in, his, pocket, and, as, a, result, he, suffered, a, highly, localized, dose, which, resulted, in, a, radiation, burn, this, injury, resulted, in, the, biological, properties, of, radiation, being, investigated, which, in, time, resulted, in, the, development, of, medical, treatment, ernest, rutherford, working, in, canada, and, england, showed, that, radioactive, decay, can, be, described, by, a, simple, equation, a, linear, first, degree, derivative, equation, now, called, first, order, kinetics, implying, that, a, given, radioactive, substance, has, a, characteristic, half, life, the, time, taken, for, the, amount, of, radioactivity, present, in, a, source, to, diminish, by, half, he, also, coined, the, terms, alpha, beta, and, gamma, rays, he, converted, nitrogen, into, oxygen, and, most, importantly, he, supervised, the, students, who, conducted, the, geiger, marsden, experiment, gold, foil, experiment, which, showed, that, the, plum, pudding, model, of, the, atom, was, wrong, in, the, plum, pudding, model, proposed, by, j, j, thomson, in, 1904, the, atom, is, composed, of, electrons, surrounded, by, a, cloud, of, positive, charge, to, balance, the, electrons, negative, charge, to, rutherford, the, gold, foil, experiment, implied, that, the, positive, charge, was, confined, to, a, very, small, nucleus, leading, first, to, the, rutherford, model, and, eventually, to, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, where, the, positive, nucleus, is, surrounded, by, the, negative, electrons, in, 1934, marie, curie, s, daughter, ir, ne, joliot, curie, and, son, in, law, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, were, the, first, to, create, artificial, radioactivity, they, bombarded, boron, with, alpha, particles, to, make, the, neutron, poor, isotope, nitrogen, 13, this, isotope, emitted, positrons, in, addition, they, bombarded, aluminium, and, magnesium, with, neutrons, to, make, new, radioisotopes, in, the, early, 1920s, otto, hahn, created, a, new, line, of, research, using, the, emanation, method, which, he, had, recently, developed, and, the, emanation, ability, he, founded, what, became, known, as, applied, radiochemistry, for, the, researching, of, general, chemical, and, physical, chemical, questions, in, 1936, cornell, university, press, published, a, book, in, english, and, later, in, russian, titled, applied, radiochemistry, which, contained, the, lectures, given, by, hahn, when, he, was, a, visiting, professor, at, cornell, university, in, ithaca, new, york, in, 1933, this, important, publication, had, a, major, influence, on, almost, all, nuclear, chemists, and, physicists, in, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, laying, the, foundation, for, modern, nuclear, chemistry, hahn, and, lise, meitner, discovered, radioactive, isotopes, of, radium, thorium, protactinium, and, uranium, he, also, discovered, the, phenomena, of, radioactive, recoil, and, nuclear, isomerism, and, pioneered, rubidium, strontium, dating, in, 1938, hahn, lise, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, discovered, nuclear, fission, for, which, hahn, received, the, 1944, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, nuclear, fission, was, the, basis, for, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, hahn, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, nuclear, chemistry, and, godfather, of, nuclear, fission, radiochemistry, is, the, chemistry, of, radioactive, materials, in, which, radioactive, isotopes, of, elements, are, used, to, study, the, properties, and, chemical, reactions, of, non, radioactive, isotopes, often, within, radiochemistry, the, absence, of, radioactivity, leads, to, a, substance, being, described, as, being, inactive, as, the, isotopes, are, stable, for, further, details, please, see, the, page, on, radiochemistry, radiation, chemistry, is, the, study, of, the, chemical, effects, of, radiation, on, matter, this, is, very, different, from, radiochemistry, as, no, radioactivity, needs, to, be, present, in, the, material, which, is, being, chemically, changed, by, the, radiation, an, example, is, the, conversion, of, water, into, hydrogen, gas, and, hydrogen, peroxide, prior, to, radiation, chemistry, it, was, commonly, believed, that, pure, water, could, not, be, destroyed, initial, experiments, were, focused, on, understanding, the, effects, of, radiation, on, matter, using, a, x, ray, generator, hugo, fricke, studied, the, biological, effects, of, radiation, as, it, became, a, common, treatment, option, and, diagnostic, method, fricke, proposed, and, subsequently, proved, that, the, energy, from, x, rays, were, able, to, convert, water, into, activated, water, allowing, it, to, react, with, dissolved, species, radiochemistry, radiation, chemistry, and, nuclear, chemical, engineering, play, a, very, important, role, for, uranium, and, thorium, fuel, precursors, synthesis, starting, from, ores, of, these, elements, fuel, fabrication, coolant, chemistry, fuel, reprocessing, radioactive, waste, treatment, and, storage, monitoring, of, radioactive, elements, release, during, reactor, operation, and, radioactive, geological, storage, etc, a, combination, of, radiochemistry, and, radiation, chemistry, is, used, to, study, nuclear, reactions, such, as, fission, and, fusion, some, early, evidence, for, nuclear, fission, was, the, formation, of, a, short, lived, radioisotope, of, barium, which, was, isolated, from, neutron, irradiated, uranium, 139, ba, with, a, half, life, of, 83, minutes, and, 140, ba, with, a, half, life, of, 12, 8, days, are, major, fission, products, of, uranium, at, the, time, it, was, thought, that, this, was, a, new, radium, isotope, as, it, was, then, standard, radiochemical, practice, to, use, a, barium, sulfate, carrier, precipitate, to, assist, in, the, isolation, of, radium, more, recently, a, combination, of, radiochemical, methods, and, nuclear, physics, has, been, used, to, try, to, make, new, superheavy, elements, it, is, thought, that, islands, of, relative, stability, exist, where, the, nuclides, have, half, lives, of, years, thus, enabling, weighable, amounts, of, the, new, elements, to, be, isolated, for, more, details, of, the, original, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, see, the, work, of, otto, hahn, this, is, the, chemistry, associated, with, any, part, of, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, including, nuclear, reprocessing, the, fuel, cycle, includes, all, the, operations, involved, in, producing, fuel, from, mining, ore, processing, and, enrichment, to, fuel, production, front, end, of, the, cycle, it, also, includes, the, in, pile, behavior, use, of, the, fuel, in, a, reactor, before, the, back, end, of, the, cycle, the, back, end, includes, the, management, of, the, used, nuclear, fuel, in, either, a, spent, fuel, pool, or, dry, storage, before, it, is, disposed, of, into, an, underground, waste, store, or, reprocessed, the, nuclear, chemistry, associated, with, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, can, be, divided, into, two, main, areas, one, area, is, concerned, with, operation, under, the, intended, conditions, while, the, other, area, is, concerned, with, maloperation, conditions, where, some, alteration, from, the, normal, operating, conditions, has, occurred, or, more, rarely, an, accident, is, occurring, without, this, process, none, of, this, would, be, true, in, the, united, states, it, is, normal, to, use, fuel, once, in, a, power, reactor, before, placing, it, in, a, waste, store, the, long, term, plan, is, currently, to, place, the, used, civilian, reactor, fuel, in, a, deep, store, this, non, reprocessing, policy, was, started, in, march, 1977, because, of, concerns, about, nuclear, weapons, proliferation, president, jimmy, carter, issued, a, presidential, directive, which, indefinitely, suspended, the, commercial, reprocessing, and, recycling, of, plutonium, in, the, united, states, this, directive, was, likely, an, attempt, by, the, united, states, to, lead, other, countries, by, example, but, many, other, nations, continue, to, reprocess, spent, nuclear, fuels, the, russian, government, under, president, vladimir, putin, repealed, a, law, which, had, banned, the, import, of, used, nuclear, fuel, which, makes, it, possible, for, russians, to, offer, a, reprocessing, service, for, clients, outside, russia, similar, to, that, offered, by, bnfl, the, current, method, of, choice, is, to, use, the, purex, liquid, liquid, extraction, process, which, uses, a, tributyl, phosphate, hydrocarbon, mixture, to, extract, both, uranium, and, plutonium, from, nitric, acid, this, extraction, is, of, the, nitrate, salts, and, is, classed, as, being, of, a, solvation, mechanism, for, example, the, extraction, of, plutonium, by, an, extraction, agent, s, in, a, nitrate, medium, occurs, by, the, following, reaction, a, complex, bond, is, formed, between, the, metal, cation, the, nitrates, and, the, tributyl, phosphate, and, a, model, compound, of, a, dioxouranium, vi, complex, with, two, nitrate, anions, and, two, triethyl, phosphate, ligands, has, been, characterised, by, x, ray, crystallography, when, the, nitric, acid, concentration, is, high, the, extraction, into, the, organic, phase, is, favored, and, when, the, nitric, acid, concentration, is, low, the, extraction, is, reversed, the, organic, phase, is, stripped, of, the, metal, it, is, normal, to, dissolve, the, used, fuel, in, nitric, acid, after, the, removal, of, the, insoluble, matter, the, uranium, and, plutonium, are, extracted, from, the, highly, active, liquor, it, is, normal, to, then, back, extract, the, loaded, organic, phase, to, create, a, medium, active, liquor, which, contains, mostly, uranium, and, plutonium, with, only, small, traces, of, fission, products, this, medium, active, aqueous, mixture, is, then, extracted, again, by, tributyl, phosphate, hydrocarbon, to, form, a, new, organic, phase, the, metal, bearing, organic, phase, is, then, stripped, of, the, metals, to, form, an, aqueous, mixture, of, only, uranium, and, plutonium, the, two, stages, of, extraction, are, used, to, improve, the, purity, of, the, actinide, product, the, organic, phase, used, for, the, first, extraction, will, suffer, a, far, greater, dose, of, radiation, the, radiation, can, degrade, the, tributyl, phosphate, into, dibutyl, hydrogen, phosphate, the, dibutyl, hydrogen, phosphate, can, act, as, an, extraction, agent, for, both, the, actinides, and, other, metals, such, as, ruthenium, the, dibutyl, hydrogen, phosphate, can, make, the, system, behave, in, a, more, complex, manner, as, it, tends, to, extract, metals, by, an, ion, exchange, mechanism, extraction, favoured, by, low, acid, concentration, to, reduce, the, effect, of, the, dibutyl, hydrogen, phosphate, it, is, common, for, the, used, organic, phase, to, be, washed, with, sodium, carbonate, solution, to, remove, the, acidic, degradation, products, of, the, tributyl, phosphatioloporus, the, purex, process, can, be, modified, to, make, a, urex, ur, anium, ex, traction, process, which, could, be, used, to, save, space, inside, high, level, nuclear, waste, disposal, sites, such, as, yucca, mountain, nuclear, waste, repository, by, removing, the, uranium, which, makes, up, the, vast, majority, of, the, mass, and, volume, of, used, fuel, and, recycling, it, as, reprocessed, uranium, the, urex, process, is, a, purex, process, which, has, been, modified, to, prevent, the, plutonium, being, extracted, this, can, be, done, by, adding, a, plutonium, reductant, before, the, first, metal, extraction, step, in, the, urex, process, 99, 9, of, the, uranium, and, 95, of, technetium, are, separated, from, each, other, and, the, other, fission, products, and, actinides, the, key, is, the, addition, of, acetohydroxamic, acid, aha, to, the, extraction, and, scrubs, sections, of, the, process, the, addition, of, aha, greatly, diminishes, the, extractability, of, plutonium, and, neptunium, providing, greater, proliferation, resistance, than, with, the, plutonium, extraction, stage, of, the, purex, process, adding, a, second, extraction, agent, octyl, phenyl, n, n, dibutyl, carbamoylmethyl, phosphine, oxide, cmpo, in, combination, with, tributylphosphate, tbp, the, purex, process, can, be, turned, into, the, truex, tr, ans, u, ranic, ex, traction, process, this, is, a, process, which, was, invented, in, the, us, by, argonne, national, laboratory, and, is, designed, to, remove, the, transuranic, metals, am, cm, from, waste, the, idea, is, that, by, lowering, the, alpha, activity, of, the, waste, the, majority, of, the, waste, can, then, be, disposed, of, with, greater, ease, in, common, with, purex, this, process, operates, by, a, solvation, mechanism, as, an, alternative, to, truex, an, extraction, process, using, a, malondiamide, has, been, devised, the, diamex, diam, ide, ex, traction, process, has, the, advantage, of, avoiding, the, formation, of, organic, waste, which, contains, elements, other, than, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and, oxygen, such, an, organic, waste, can, be, burned, without, the, formation, of, acidic, gases, which, could, contribute, to, acid, rain, the, diamex, process, is, being, worked, on, in, europe, by, the, french, cea, the, process, is, sufficiently, mature, that, an, industrial, plant, could, be, constructed, with, the, existing, knowledge, of, the, process, in, common, with, purex, this, process, operates, by, a, solvation, mechanism, selective, actinide, extraction, sanex, as, part, of, the, management, of, minor, actinides, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, lanthanides, and, trivalent, minor, actinides, should, be, removed, from, the, purex, raffinate, by, a, process, such, as, diamex, or, truex, in, order, to, allow, the, actinides, such, as, americium, to, be, either, reused, in, industrial, sources, or, used, as, fuel, the, lanthanides, must, be, removed, the, lanthanides, have, large, neutron, cross, sections, and, hence, they, would, poison, a, neutron, driven, nuclear, reaction, to, date, the, extraction, system, for, the, sanex, process, has, not, been, defined, but, currently, several, different, research, groups, are, working, towards, a, process, for, instance, the, french, cea, is, working, on, a, bis, triazinyl, pyridine, btp, based, process, other, systems, such, as, the, dithiophosphinic, acids, are, being, worked, on, by, some, other, workers, this, is, the, universal, ex, traction, process, which, was, developed, in, russia, and, the, czech, republic, it, is, a, process, designed, to, remove, all, of, the, most, troublesome, sr, cs, and, minor, actinides, radioisotopes, from, the, raffinates, left, after, the, extraction, of, uranium, and, plutonium, from, used, nuclear, fuel, the, chemistry, is, based, upon, the, interaction, of, caesium, and, strontium, with, poly, ethylene, oxide, poly, ethylene, glycol, and, a, cobalt, carborane, anion, known, as, chlorinated, cobalt, dicarbollide, the, actinides, are, extracted, by, cmpo, and, the, diluent, is, a, polar, aromatic, such, as, nitrobenzene, other, diluents, such, as, meta, nitrobenzotri, fluoride, and, phenyl, trifluoromethyl, sulfone, have, been, suggested, as, well, another, important, area, of, nuclear, chemistry, is, the, study, of, how, fission, products, interact, with, surfaces, this, is, thought, to, control, the, rate, of, release, and, migration, of, fission, products, both, from, waste, containers, under, normal, conditions, and, from, power, reactors, under, accident, conditions, like, chromate, and, molybdate, the, 99, tco, 4, anion, can, react, with, steel, surfaces, to, form, a, corrosion, resistant, layer, in, this, way, these, metaloxo, anions, act, as, anodic, corrosion, inhibitors, the, formation, of, 99, tco, 2, on, steel, surfaces, is, one, effect, which, will, retard, the, release, of, 99, tc, from, nuclear, waste, drums, and, nuclear, equipment, which, has, been, lost, before, decontamination, e, g, submarine, reactors, lost, at, sea, this, 99, tco, 2, layer, renders, the, steel, surface, passive, inhibiting, the, anodic, corrosion, reaction, the, radioactive, nature, of, technetium, makes, this, corrosion, protection, impractical, in, almost, all, situations, it, has, also, been, shown, that, 99, tco, 4, anions, react, to, form, a, layer, on, the, surface, of, activated, carbon, charcoal, or, aluminium, a, short, review, of, the, biochemical, properties, of, a, series, of, key, long, lived, radioisotopes, can, be, read, on, line, 99, tc, in, nuclear, waste, may, exist, in, chemical, forms, other, than, the, 99, tco, 4, anion, these, other, forms, have, different, chemical, properties, similarly, the, release, of, iodine, 131, in, a, serious, power, reactor, accident, could, be, retarded, by, absorption, on, metal, surfaces, within, the, nuclear, plant, despite, the, growing, use, of, nuclear, medicine, the, potential, expansion, of, nuclear, power, plants, and, worries, about, protection, against, nuclear, threats, and, the, management, of, the, nuclear, waste, generated, in, past, decades, the, number, of, students, opting, to, specialize, in, nuclear, and, radiochemistry, has, decreased, significantly, over, the, past, few, decades, now, with, many, experts, in, these, fields, approaching, retirement, age, action, is, needed, to, avoid, a, workforce, gap, in, these, critical, fields, for, example, by, building, student, interest, in, these, careers, expanding, the, educational, capacity, of, universities, and, colleges, and, providing, more, specific, on, the, job, training, nuclear, and, radiochemistry, nrc, is, mostly, being, taught, at, university, level, usually, first, at, the, master, and, phd, degree, level, in, europe, as, substantial, effort, is, being, done, to, harmonize, and, prepare, the, nrc, education, for, the, industry, s, and, society, s, future, needs, this, effort, is, being, coordinated, in, a, project, funded, by, the, coordinated, action, supported, by, the, european, atomic, energy, community, s, 7th, framework, program, although, nucwik, is, primarily, aimed, at, teachers, anyone, interested, in, nuclear, and, radiochemistry, is, welcome, and, can, find, a, lot, of, information, and, material, explaining, topics, related, to, nrc, some, methods, first, developed, within, nuclear, chemistry, and, physics, have, become, so, widely, used, within, chemistry, and, other, physical, sciences, that, they, may, be, best, thought, of, as, separate, from, normal, nuclear, chemistry, for, example, the, isotope, effect, is, used, so, extensively, to, investigate, chemical, mechanisms, and, the, use, of, cosmogenic, isotopes, and, long, lived, unstable, isotopes, in, geology, that, it, is, best, to, consider, much, of, isotopic, chemistry, as, separate, from, nuclear, chemistry, the, mechanisms, of, chemical, reactions, can, be, investigated, by, observing, how, the, kinetics, of, a, reaction, is, changed, by, making, an, isotopic, modification, of, a, substrate, known, as, the, kinetic, isotope, effect, this, is, now, a, standard, method, in, organic, chemistry, briefly, replacing, normal, hydrogen, protons, by, deuterium, within, a, molecule, causes, the, molecular, vibrational, frequency, of, x, h, for, example, c, h, n, h, and, o, h, bonds, to, decrease, which, leads, to, a, decrease, in, vibrational, zero, point, energy, this, can, lead, to, a, decrease, in, the, reaction, rate, if, the, rate, determining, step, involves, breaking, a, bond, between, hydrogen, and, another, atom, thus, if, the, reaction, changes, in, rate, when, protons, are, replaced, by, deuteriums, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, the, breaking, of, the, bond, to, hydrogen, is, part, of, the, step, which, determines, the, rate, cosmogenic, isotopes, are, formed, by, the, interaction, of, cosmic, rays, with, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, these, can, be, used, for, dating, purposes, and, for, use, as, natural, tracers, in, addition, by, careful, measurement, of, some, ratios, of, stable, isotopes, it, is, possible, to, obtain, new, insights, into, the, origin, of, bullets, ages, of, ice, samples, ages, of, rocks, and, the, diet, of, a, person, can, be, identified, from, a, hair, or, other, tissue, sample, see, isotope, geochemistry, and, isotopic, signature, for, further, details, within, living, things, isotopic, labels, both, radioactive, and, nonradioactive, can, be, used, to, probe, how, the, complex, web, of, reactions, which, makes, up, the, metabolism, of, an, organism, converts, one, substance, to, another, for, instance, a, green, plant, uses, light, energy, to, convert, water, and, carbon, dioxide, into, glucose, by, photosynthesis, if, the, oxygen, in, the, water, is, labeled, then, the, label, appears, in, the, oxygen, gas, formed, by, the, plant, and, not, in, the, glucose, formed, in, the, chloroplasts, within, the, plant, cells, for, biochemical, and, physiological, experiments, and, medical, methods, a, number, of, specific, isotopes, have, important, applications, by, organic, synthesis, it, is, possible, to, create, a, complex, molecule, with, a, radioactive, label, that, can, be, confined, to, a, small, area, of, the, molecule, for, short, lived, isotopes, such, as, 11, c, very, rapid, synthetic, methods, have, been, developed, to, permit, the, rapid, addition, of, the, radioactive, isotope, to, the, molecule, for, instance, a, palladium, catalysed, carbonylation, reaction, in, a, microfluidic, device, has, been, used, to, rapidly, form, amides, and, it, might, be, possible, to, use, this, method, to, form, radioactive, imaging, agents, for, pet, imaging, nuclear, spectroscopy, are, methods, that, use, the, nucleus, to, obtain, information, of, the, local, structure, in, matter, important, methods, are, nmr, see, below, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, and, perturbed, angular, correlation, these, methods, use, the, interaction, of, the, hyperfine, field, with, the, nucleus, spin, the, field, can, be, magnetic, or, and, electric, and, are, created, by, the, electrons, of, the, atom, and, its, surrounding, neighbours, thus, these, methods, investigate, the, local, structure, in, matter, mainly, condensed, matter, in, condensed, matter, physics, and, solid, state, chemistry, nmr, spectroscopy, uses, the, net, spin, of, nuclei, in, a, substance, upon, energy, absorption, to, identify, molecules, this, has, now, become, a, standard, spectroscopic, tool, within, synthetic, chemistry, one, major, use, of, nmr, is, to, determine, the, bond, connectivity, within, an, organic, molecule, nmr, imaging, also, uses, the, net, spin, of, nuclei, commonly, protons, for, imaging, this, is, widely, used, for, diagnostic, purposes, in, medicine, and, can, provide, detailed, images, of, the, inside, of, a, person, without, inflicting, any, radiation, upon, them, in, a, medical, setting, nmr, is, often, known, simply, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, as, the, word, nuclear, has, negative, connotations, for, many, people
