filtration, is, a, physical, separation, process, that, separates, solid, matter, and, fluid, from, a, mixture, using, a, filter, medium, that, has, a, complex, structure, through, which, only, the, fluid, can, pass, solid, particles, that, cannot, pass, through, the, filter, medium, are, described, as, oversize, and, the, fluid, that, passes, through, is, called, the, filtrate, oversize, particles, may, form, a, filter, cake, on, top, of, the, filter, and, may, also, block, the, filter, lattice, preventing, the, fluid, phase, from, crossing, the, filter, known, as, blinding, the, size, of, the, largest, particles, that, can, successfully, pass, through, a, filter, is, called, the, effective, pore, size, of, that, filter, the, separation, of, solid, and, fluid, is, imperfect, solids, will, be, contaminated, with, some, fluid, and, filtrate, will, contain, fine, particles, depending, on, the, pore, size, filter, thickness, and, biological, activity, filtration, occurs, both, in, nature, and, in, engineered, systems, there, are, biological, geological, and, industrial, forms, filtration, is, also, used, to, describe, biological, and, physical, systems, that, not, only, separate, solids, from, a, fluid, stream, but, also, remove, chemical, species, and, biological, organisms, by, entrainment, phagocytosis, adsorption, and, absorption, examples, include, slow, sand, filters, and, trickling, filters, it, is, also, used, as, a, general, term, for, macrophage, in, which, organisms, use, a, variety, of, means, to, filter, small, food, particles, from, their, environment, examples, range, from, the, microscopic, vorticella, up, to, the, basking, shark, one, of, the, largest, fishes, and, the, baleen, whales, all, of, which, are, described, as, filter, feeders, there, are, many, different, methods, of, filtration, all, aim, to, attain, the, separation, of, substances, separation, is, achieved, by, some, form, of, interaction, between, the, substance, or, objects, to, be, removed, and, the, filter, the, substance, that, is, to, pass, through, the, filter, must, be, a, fluid, i, e, a, liquid, or, gas, methods, of, filtration, vary, depending, on, the, location, of, the, targeted, material, i, e, whether, it, is, dissolved, in, the, fluid, phase, or, suspended, as, a, solid, there, are, several, laboratory, filtration, techniques, depending, on, the, desired, outcome, namely, hot, cold, and, vacuum, filtration, some, of, the, major, purposes, of, obtaining, the, desired, outcome, are, for, the, removal, of, impurities, from, a, mixture, or, for, the, isolation, of, solids, from, a, mixture, hot, filtration, method, is, mainly, used, to, separate, solids, from, a, hot, solution, this, is, done, to, prevent, crystal, formation, in, the, filter, funnel, and, other, apparatus, that, come, in, contact, with, the, solution, as, a, result, the, apparatus, and, the, solution, used, are, heated, to, prevent, the, rapid, decrease, in, temperature, which, in, turn, would, lead, to, the, crystallisation, of, the, solids, in, the, funnel, and, hinder, the, filtration, process, one, of, the, most, important, measures, to, prevent, the, formation, of, crystals, in, the, funnel, and, to, undergo, effective, hot, filtration, is, the, use, stemless, filter, funnel, due, to, the, absence, of, a, stem, in, the, filter, funnel, there, is, a, decrease, in, the, surface, area, of, contact, between, the, solution, and, the, stem, of, the, filter, funnel, hence, preventing, re, crystallization, of, solid, in, the, funnel, and, adversely, affecting, the, filtration, process, cold, filtration, method, is, the, use, of, an, ice, bath, to, rapidly, cool, the, solution, to, be, crystallized, rather, than, leaving, it, to, cool, slowly, in, the, room, atmosphere, this, technique, results, in, the, formation, of, very, small, crystals, as, opposed, to, getting, large, crystals, by, cooling, the, solution, at, room, temperature, vacuum, filtration, technique, is, mostly, preferred, for, small, batches, of, solution, to, dry, small, crystals, quickly, this, method, requires, a, b, chner, funnel, filter, paper, of, a, smaller, diameter, than, the, funnel, b, chner, flask, and, rubber, tubing, to, connect, to, a, vacuum, source, centrifugal, filtration, is, carried, out, by, rapidly, rotating, the, substance, to, be, filtered, the, more, dense, material, is, separated, from, the, less, dense, matter, by, the, horizontal, rotation, gravity, filtration, is, the, process, of, pouring, the, mixture, from, a, higher, location, to, a, lower, one, it, is, frequently, accomplished, via, simple, filtration, which, involves, placing, filter, paper, in, a, glass, funnel, with, the, liquid, passing, through, by, gravity, while, the, insoluble, solid, particles, are, caught, by, the, filter, paper, filter, cones, fluted, filters, or, filtering, pipets, can, all, be, employed, depending, on, the, amount, of, the, substance, at, hand, only, when, a, driving, force, is, supplied, will, the, fluid, to, be, filtered, be, able, to, flow, through, the, filter, media, gravity, centrifugation, applying, pressure, to, the, fluid, above, the, filter, applying, a, vacuum, below, the, filter, or, a, combination, of, these, factors, may, all, contribute, to, this, force, in, both, straightforward, laboratory, filtrations, and, massive, sand, bed, filters, gravitational, force, alone, may, be, utilized, centrifuges, with, a, bowl, holding, a, porous, filter, media, can, be, thought, of, as, filters, in, which, a, centrifugal, force, several, times, stronger, than, gravity, replaces, gravitational, force, a, partial, vacuum, is, typically, provided, to, the, container, below, the, filter, media, when, laboratory, filtration, is, challenging, to, speed, up, the, filtering, process, depending, on, the, type, of, filter, being, used, the, majority, of, industrial, filtration, operations, employ, pressure, or, vacuum, to, speed, up, filtering, and, reduce, the, amount, of, equipment, needed, filter, media, are, the, materials, used, to, do, the, separation, of, materials, two, main, types, of, filter, media, are, employed, in, laboratories, surface, filters, which, are, solid, sieves, that, trap, the, solid, particles, with, or, without, the, aid, of, filter, paper, e, g, b, chner, funnel, belt, filter, rotary, vacuum, drum, filter, cross, flow, filters, screen, filter, and, depth, filters, a, bed, of, granular, material, which, retains, the, solid, particles, as, they, pass, e, g, sand, filter, the, surface, filter, type, allows, the, solid, particles, i, e, the, residue, to, be, collected, intact, the, depth, filter, does, not, permit, this, however, the, depth, filter, is, less, prone, to, clogging, due, to, the, greater, surface, area, where, the, particles, can, be, trapped, also, when, the, solid, particles, are, very, fine, it, is, often, cheaper, and, easier, to, discard, the, contaminated, granules, than, to, clean, the, solid, sieve, filter, media, can, be, cleaned, by, rinsing, with, solvents, or, detergents, or, backwashing, alternatively, in, engineering, applications, such, as, swimming, pool, water, treatment, plants, they, may, be, cleaned, by, backwashing, self, cleaning, screen, filters, utilize, point, of, suction, backwashing, to, clean, the, screen, without, interrupting, system, flow, fluids, flow, through, a, filter, due, to, a, pressure, difference, fluid, flows, from, the, high, pressure, side, to, the, low, pressure, side, of, the, filter, the, simplest, method, to, achieve, this, is, by, gravity, which, can, be, seen, in, the, coffeemaker, example, in, the, laboratory, pressure, in, the, form, of, compressed, air, on, the, feed, side, or, vacuum, on, the, filtrate, side, may, be, applied, to, make, the, filtration, process, faster, though, this, may, lead, to, clogging, or, the, passage, of, fine, particles, alternatively, the, liquid, may, flow, through, the, filter, by, the, force, exerted, by, a, pump, a, method, commonly, used, in, industry, when, a, reduced, filtration, time, is, important, in, this, case, the, filter, need, not, be, mounted, vertically, certain, filter, aids, may, be, used, to, aid, filtration, these, are, often, incompressible, diatomaceous, earth, or, kieselguhr, which, is, composed, primarily, of, silica, also, used, are, wood, cellulose, and, other, inert, porous, solids, such, as, the, cheaper, and, safer, perlite, activated, carbon, is, often, used, in, industrial, applications, that, require, changes, in, the, filtrate, s, properties, such, as, altering, colour, or, odour, these, filter, aids, can, be, used, in, two, different, ways, they, can, be, used, as, a, precoat, before, the, slurry, is, filtered, this, will, prevent, gelatinous, type, solids, from, plugging, the, filter, medium, and, also, give, a, clearer, filtrate, they, can, also, be, added, to, the, slurry, before, filtration, this, increases, the, porosity, of, the, cake, and, reduces, the, resistance, of, the, cake, during, filtration, in, a, rotary, filter, the, filter, aid, may, be, applied, as, a, precoat, subsequently, thin, slices, of, this, layer, are, sliced, off, with, the, cake, the, use, of, filter, aids, is, usually, limited, to, cases, where, the, cake, is, discarded, or, where, the, precipitate, can, be, chemically, separated, from, the, filter, filtration, is, a, more, efficient, method, for, the, separation, of, mixtures, than, decantation, but, is, much, more, time, consuming, if, very, small, amounts, of, solution, are, involved, most, of, the, solution, may, be, soaked, up, by, the, filter, medium, an, alternative, to, filtration, is, centrifugation, instead, of, filtering, the, mixture, of, solid, and, liquid, particles, the, mixture, is, centrifuged, to, force, the, usually, denser, solid, to, the, bottom, where, it, often, forms, a, firm, cake, the, liquid, above, can, then, be, decanted, this, method, is, especially, useful, for, separating, solids, that, do, not, filter, well, such, as, gelatinous, or, fine, particles, these, solids, can, clog, or, pass, through, the, filter, respectively, biological, filtration, may, take, place, inside, an, organism, or, the, biological, component, may, be, grown, on, a, medium, in, the, material, being, filtered, removal, of, solids, emulsified, components, organic, chemicals, and, ions, may, be, achieved, by, ingestion, and, digestion, adsorption, or, absorption, because, of, the, complexity, of, biological, interactions, especially, in, multi, organism, communities, it, is, often, not, possible, to, determine, which, processes, are, achieving, the, filtration, result, at, the, molecular, level, it, may, often, be, by, individual, catalytic, enzyme, actions, within, an, individual, organism, the, waste, products, of, some, organisms, may, subsequently, broken, down, by, other, organisms, to, extract, as, much, energy, as, possible, and, in, so, doing, reduce, complex, organic, molecules, to, very, simple, inorganic, species, such, as, water, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, inside, mammals, reptiles, and, birds, the, kidneys, function, by, renal, filtration, in, which, the, glomerulus, selectively, removes, undesirable, constituents, such, as, urea, followed, by, selective, reabsorption, of, many, substances, essential, for, the, body, to, maintain, homeostasis, the, complete, process, is, termed, excretion, similar, but, often, less, complex, solutions, are, deployed, in, all, animals, even, the, protozoa, where, the, contractile, vacuole, provides, a, similar, function, biofilms, are, often, complex, communities, of, bacteria, phages, yeasts, and, often, more, complex, organisms, including, protozoa, rotifers, and, annelids, which, form, dynamic, and, complex, frequently, gelatinous, films, on, wet, substrates, such, biofilms, coat, the, rocks, of, most, rivers, and, the, sea, and, they, provide, the, key, filtration, capability, of, the, schmutzdecke, on, the, surface, of, slow, sand, filters, and, the, film, on, the, filter, media, of, trickling, filters, which, are, used, to, create, potable, water, and, treat, sewage, respectively, an, example, of, a, biofilm, is, a, biological, slime, which, may, be, found, in, lakes, rivers, rocks, etc, the, utilization, of, single, or, dual, species, biofilms, is, a, novel, technology, since, natural, biofilms, are, sluggishly, developing, the, use, of, biofilms, in, the, biofiltration, process, allows, for, the, attachment, of, desirable, biomass, and, critical, nutrients, to, immobilized, support, so, that, water, may, be, reused, for, various, processes, advances, in, biofiltration, methods, assist, in, removing, significant, volumes, of, effluents, from, the, wastewater, systems, for, biologically, treating, wastewater, are, crucial, for, enhancing, both, human, health, and, water, quality, biofilm, technology, the, formation, of, biofilms, on, various, filter, media, and, other, factors, have, an, impact, on, the, growth, structure, and, function, of, these, biofilms, to, conduct, a, thorough, investigation, of, the, composition, diversity, and, dynamics, of, biofilms, it, also, takes, on, a, variety, of, traditional, and, contemporary, molecular, approaches, filter, feeders, are, organisms, that, obtain, their, food, by, filtering, their, generally, aquatic, environment, many, of, the, protozoa, are, filter, feeders, using, a, range, of, adaptations, including, rigid, spikes, of, protoplasm, held, in, the, water, flow, as, in, the, suctoria, to, various, arrangements, of, beating, cillia, to, direct, particles, to, the, mouth, including, organisms, such, as, vorticella, which, have, a, complex, ring, of, cilia, which, create, a, vortex, in, the, flow, drafting, particles, into, the, oral, cavity, similar, feeding, techniques, are, used, by, the, rotifera, and, the, ectoprocta, many, aquatic, arthropods, are, filter, feeders, some, use, rhythmical, beating, of, abdominal, limbs, to, create, a, water, current, to, the, mouth, whilst, the, hairs, on, the, legs, trap, any, particle, others, such, as, some, caddis, flies, spin, fine, webs, in, the, water, flow, to, trap, particles, many, filtration, processes, include, more, than, one, filtration, mechanism, and, particulates, are, often, removed, from, the, fluid, first, to, prevent, clogging, of, downstream, elements, particulate, filtration, includes, adsorption, filtration, removes, contaminants, by, adsorption, of, the, contaminant, by, the, filter, medium, this, requires, intimate, contact, between, the, filter, medium, and, the, filtrate, and, takes, time, for, diffusion, to, bring, the, contaminant, into, direct, contact, with, the, medium, while, passing, through, it, referred, to, as, dwell, time, slower, flow, also, reduces, pressure, drop, across, the, filter, applications, include, combined, applications, include
