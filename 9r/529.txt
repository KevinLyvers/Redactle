an, alloy, is, a, mixture, of, chemical, elements, of, which, in, most, cases, at, least, one, is, a, metallic, element, although, it, is, also, sometimes, used, for, mixtures, of, elements, herein, only, metallic, alloys, are, described, most, alloys, are, metallic, and, show, good, electrical, conductivity, ductility, opacity, and, luster, and, may, have, properties, that, differ, from, those, of, the, pure, elements, such, as, increased, strength, or, hardness, in, some, cases, an, alloy, may, reduce, the, overall, cost, of, the, material, while, preserving, important, properties, in, other, cases, the, mixture, imparts, synergistic, properties, such, as, corrosion, resistance, or, mechanical, strength, in, an, alloy, the, atoms, are, joined, by, metallic, bonding, rather, than, by, covalent, bonds, typically, found, in, chemical, compounds, the, alloy, constituents, are, usually, measured, by, mass, percentage, for, practical, applications, and, in, atomic, fraction, for, basic, science, studies, alloys, are, usually, classified, as, substitutional, or, interstitial, alloys, depending, on, the, atomic, arrangement, that, forms, the, alloy, they, can, be, further, classified, as, homogeneous, consisting, of, a, single, phase, or, heterogeneous, consisting, of, two, or, more, phases, or, intermetallic, an, alloy, may, be, a, solid, solution, of, metal, elements, a, single, phase, where, all, metallic, grains, crystals, are, of, the, same, composition, or, a, mixture, of, metallic, phases, two, or, more, solutions, forming, a, microstructure, of, different, crystals, within, the, metal, examples, of, alloys, include, red, gold, gold, and, copper, white, gold, gold, and, silver, sterling, silver, silver, and, copper, steel, or, silicon, steel, iron, with, non, metallic, carbon, or, silicon, respectively, solder, brass, pewter, duralumin, bronze, and, amalgams, alloys, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, from, the, steel, alloys, used, in, everything, from, buildings, to, automobiles, to, surgical, tools, to, exotic, titanium, alloys, used, in, the, aerospace, industry, to, beryllium, copper, alloys, for, non, sparking, tools, an, alloy, is, a, mixture, of, chemical, elements, which, forms, an, impure, substance, admixture, that, retains, the, characteristics, of, a, metal, an, alloy, is, distinct, from, an, impure, metal, in, that, with, an, alloy, the, added, elements, are, well, controlled, to, produce, desirable, properties, while, impure, metals, such, as, wrought, iron, are, less, controlled, but, are, often, considered, useful, alloys, are, made, by, mixing, two, or, more, elements, at, least, one, of, which, is, a, metal, this, is, usually, called, the, primary, metal, or, the, base, metal, and, the, name, of, this, metal, may, also, be, the, name, of, the, alloy, the, other, constituents, may, or, may, not, be, metals, but, when, mixed, with, the, molten, base, they, will, be, soluble, and, dissolve, into, the, mixture, the, mechanical, properties, of, alloys, will, often, be, quite, different, from, those, of, its, individual, constituents, a, metal, that, is, normally, very, soft, malleable, such, as, aluminium, can, be, altered, by, alloying, it, with, another, soft, metal, such, as, copper, although, both, metals, are, very, soft, and, ductile, the, resulting, aluminium, alloy, will, have, much, greater, strength, adding, a, small, amount, of, non, metallic, carbon, to, iron, trades, its, great, ductility, for, the, greater, strength, of, an, alloy, called, steel, due, to, its, very, high, strength, but, still, substantial, toughness, and, its, ability, to, be, greatly, altered, by, heat, treatment, steel, is, one, of, the, most, useful, and, common, alloys, in, modern, use, by, adding, chromium, to, steel, its, resistance, to, corrosion, can, be, enhanced, creating, stainless, steel, while, adding, silicon, will, alter, its, electrical, characteristics, producing, silicon, steel, like, oil, and, water, a, molten, metal, may, not, always, mix, with, another, element, for, example, pure, iron, is, almost, completely, insoluble, with, copper, even, when, the, constituents, are, soluble, each, will, usually, have, a, saturation, point, beyond, which, no, more, of, the, constituent, can, be, added, iron, for, example, can, hold, a, maximum, of, 6, 67, carbon, although, the, elements, of, an, alloy, usually, must, be, soluble, in, the, liquid, state, they, may, not, always, be, soluble, in, the, solid, state, if, the, metals, remain, soluble, when, solid, the, alloy, forms, a, solid, solution, becoming, a, homogeneous, structure, consisting, of, identical, crystals, called, a, phase, if, as, the, mixture, cools, the, constituents, become, insoluble, they, may, separate, to, form, two, or, more, different, types, of, crystals, creating, a, heterogeneous, microstructure, of, different, phases, some, with, more, of, one, constituent, than, the, other, however, in, other, alloys, the, insoluble, elements, may, not, separate, until, after, crystallization, occurs, if, cooled, very, quickly, they, first, crystallize, as, a, homogeneous, phase, but, they, are, supersaturated, with, the, secondary, constituents, as, time, passes, the, atoms, of, these, supersaturated, alloys, can, separate, from, the, crystal, lattice, becoming, more, stable, and, forming, a, second, phase, that, serves, to, reinforce, the, crystals, internally, some, alloys, such, as, electrum, an, alloy, of, silver, and, gold, occur, naturally, meteorites, are, sometimes, made, of, naturally, occurring, alloys, of, iron, and, nickel, but, are, not, native, to, the, earth, one, of, the, first, alloys, made, by, humans, was, bronze, which, is, a, mixture, of, the, metals, tin, and, copper, bronze, was, an, extremely, useful, alloy, to, the, ancients, because, it, is, much, stronger, and, harder, than, either, of, its, components, steel, was, another, common, alloy, however, in, ancient, times, it, could, only, be, created, as, an, accidental, byproduct, from, the, heating, of, iron, ore, in, fires, smelting, during, the, manufacture, of, iron, other, ancient, alloys, include, pewter, brass, and, pig, iron, in, the, modern, age, steel, can, be, created, in, many, forms, carbon, steel, can, be, made, by, varying, only, the, carbon, content, producing, soft, alloys, like, mild, steel, or, hard, alloys, like, spring, steel, alloy, steels, can, be, made, by, adding, other, elements, such, as, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, or, nickel, resulting, in, alloys, such, as, high, speed, steel, or, tool, steel, small, amounts, of, manganese, are, usually, alloyed, with, most, modern, steels, because, of, its, ability, to, remove, unwanted, impurities, like, phosphorus, sulfur, and, oxygen, which, can, have, detrimental, effects, on, the, alloy, however, most, alloys, were, not, created, until, the, 1900s, such, as, various, aluminium, titanium, nickel, and, magnesium, alloys, some, modern, superalloys, such, as, incoloy, inconel, and, hastelloy, may, consist, of, a, multitude, of, different, elements, an, alloy, is, technically, an, impure, metal, but, when, referring, to, alloys, the, term, impurities, usually, denotes, undesirable, elements, such, impurities, are, introduced, from, the, base, metals, and, alloying, elements, but, are, removed, during, processing, for, instance, sulfur, is, a, common, impurity, in, steel, sulfur, combines, readily, with, iron, to, form, iron, sulfide, which, is, very, brittle, creating, weak, spots, in, the, steel, lithium, sodium, and, calcium, are, common, impurities, in, aluminium, alloys, which, can, have, adverse, effects, on, the, structural, integrity, of, castings, conversely, otherwise, pure, metals, that, contain, unwanted, impurities, are, often, called, impure, metals, and, are, not, usually, referred, to, as, alloys, oxygen, present, in, the, air, readily, combines, with, most, metals, to, form, metal, oxides, especially, at, higher, temperatures, encountered, during, alloying, great, care, is, often, taken, during, the, alloying, process, to, remove, excess, impurities, using, fluxes, chemical, additives, or, other, methods, of, extractive, metallurgy, alloying, a, metal, is, done, by, combining, it, with, one, or, more, other, elements, the, most, common, and, oldest, alloying, process, is, performed, by, heating, the, base, metal, beyond, its, melting, point, and, then, dissolving, the, solutes, into, the, molten, liquid, which, may, be, possible, even, if, the, melting, point, of, the, solute, is, far, greater, than, that, of, the, base, for, example, in, its, liquid, state, titanium, is, a, very, strong, solvent, capable, of, dissolving, most, metals, and, elements, in, addition, it, readily, absorbs, gases, like, oxygen, and, burns, in, the, presence, of, nitrogen, this, increases, the, chance, of, contamination, from, any, contacting, surface, and, so, must, be, melted, in, vacuum, induction, heating, and, special, water, cooled, copper, crucibles, however, some, metals, and, solutes, such, as, iron, and, carbon, have, very, high, melting, points, and, were, impossible, for, ancient, people, to, melt, thus, alloying, in, particular, interstitial, alloying, may, also, be, performed, with, one, or, more, constituents, in, a, gaseous, state, such, as, found, in, a, blast, furnace, to, make, pig, iron, liquid, gas, nitriding, carbonitriding, or, other, forms, of, case, hardening, solid, gas, or, the, cementation, process, used, to, make, blister, steel, solid, gas, it, may, also, be, done, with, one, more, or, all, of, the, constituents, in, the, solid, state, such, as, found, in, ancient, methods, of, pattern, welding, solid, solid, shear, steel, solid, solid, or, crucible, steel, production, solid, liquid, mixing, the, elements, via, solid, state, diffusion, by, adding, another, element, to, a, metal, differences, in, the, size, of, the, atoms, create, internal, stresses, in, the, lattice, of, the, metallic, crystals, stresses, that, often, enhance, its, properties, for, example, the, combination, of, carbon, with, iron, produces, steel, which, is, stronger, than, iron, its, primary, element, the, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, of, alloys, is, usually, lower, than, that, of, the, pure, metals, the, physical, properties, such, as, density, reactivity, young, s, modulus, of, an, alloy, may, not, differ, greatly, from, those, of, its, base, element, but, engineering, properties, such, as, tensile, strength, ductility, and, shear, strength, may, be, substantially, different, from, those, of, the, constituent, materials, this, is, sometimes, a, result, of, the, sizes, of, the, atoms, in, the, alloy, because, larger, atoms, exert, a, compressive, force, on, neighboring, atoms, and, smaller, atoms, exert, a, tensile, force, on, their, neighbors, helping, the, alloy, resist, deformation, sometimes, alloys, may, exhibit, marked, differences, in, behavior, even, when, small, amounts, of, one, element, are, present, for, example, impurities, in, semiconducting, ferromagnetic, alloys, lead, to, different, properties, as, first, predicted, by, white, hogan, suhl, tian, abrie, and, nakamura, unlike, pure, metals, most, alloys, do, not, have, a, single, melting, point, but, a, melting, range, during, which, the, material, is, a, mixture, of, solid, and, liquid, phases, a, slush, the, temperature, at, which, melting, begins, is, called, the, solidus, and, the, temperature, when, melting, is, just, complete, is, called, the, liquidus, for, many, alloys, there, is, a, particular, alloy, proportion, in, some, cases, more, than, one, called, either, a, eutectic, mixture, or, a, peritectic, composition, which, gives, the, alloy, a, unique, and, low, melting, point, and, no, liquid, solid, slush, transition, alloying, elements, are, added, to, a, base, metal, to, induce, hardness, toughness, ductility, or, other, desired, properties, most, metals, and, alloys, can, be, work, hardened, by, creating, defects, in, their, crystal, structure, these, defects, are, created, during, plastic, deformation, by, hammering, bending, extruding, et, cetera, and, are, permanent, unless, the, metal, is, recrystallized, otherwise, some, alloys, can, also, have, their, properties, altered, by, heat, treatment, nearly, all, metals, can, be, softened, by, annealing, which, recrystallizes, the, alloy, and, repairs, the, defects, but, not, as, many, can, be, hardened, by, controlled, heating, and, cooling, many, alloys, of, aluminium, copper, magnesium, titanium, and, nickel, can, be, strengthened, to, some, degree, by, some, method, of, heat, treatment, but, few, respond, to, this, to, the, same, degree, as, does, steel, the, base, metal, iron, of, the, iron, carbon, alloy, known, as, steel, undergoes, a, change, in, the, arrangement, allotropy, of, the, atoms, of, its, crystal, matrix, at, a, certain, temperature, usually, between, 820, c, 1, 500, f, and, 870, c, 1, 600, f, depending, on, carbon, content, this, allows, the, smaller, carbon, atoms, to, enter, the, interstices, of, the, iron, crystal, when, this, diffusion, happens, the, carbon, atoms, are, said, to, be, in, solution, in, the, iron, forming, a, particular, single, homogeneous, crystalline, phase, called, austenite, if, the, steel, is, cooled, slowly, the, carbon, can, diffuse, out, of, the, iron, and, it, will, gradually, revert, to, its, low, temperature, allotrope, during, slow, cooling, the, carbon, atoms, will, no, longer, be, as, soluble, with, the, iron, and, will, be, forced, to, precipitate, out, of, solution, nucleating, into, a, more, concentrated, form, of, iron, carbide, fe, 3, c, in, the, spaces, between, the, pure, iron, crystals, the, steel, then, becomes, heterogeneous, as, it, is, formed, of, two, phases, the, iron, carbon, phase, called, cementite, or, carbide, and, pure, iron, ferrite, such, a, heat, treatment, produces, a, steel, that, is, rather, soft, if, the, steel, is, cooled, quickly, however, the, carbon, atoms, will, not, have, time, to, diffuse, and, precipitate, out, as, carbide, but, will, be, trapped, within, the, iron, crystals, when, rapidly, cooled, a, diffusionless, martensite, transformation, occurs, in, which, the, carbon, atoms, become, trapped, in, solution, this, causes, the, iron, crystals, to, deform, as, the, crystal, structure, tries, to, change, to, its, low, temperature, state, leaving, those, crystals, very, hard, but, much, less, ductile, more, brittle, while, the, high, strength, of, steel, results, when, diffusion, and, precipitation, is, prevented, forming, martensite, most, heat, treatable, alloys, are, precipitation, hardening, alloys, that, depend, on, the, diffusion, of, alloying, elements, to, achieve, their, strength, when, heated, to, form, a, solution, and, then, cooled, quickly, these, alloys, become, much, softer, than, normal, during, the, diffusionless, transformation, but, then, harden, as, they, age, the, solutes, in, these, alloys, will, precipitate, over, time, forming, intermetallic, phases, which, are, difficult, to, discern, from, the, base, metal, unlike, steel, in, which, the, solid, solution, separates, into, different, crystal, phases, carbide, and, ferrite, precipitation, hardening, alloys, form, different, phases, within, the, same, crystal, these, intermetallic, alloys, appear, homogeneous, in, crystal, structure, but, tend, to, behave, heterogeneously, becoming, hard, and, somewhat, brittle, in, 1906, precipitation, hardening, alloys, were, discovered, by, alfred, wilm, precipitation, hardening, alloys, such, as, certain, alloys, of, aluminium, titanium, and, copper, are, heat, treatable, alloys, that, soften, when, quenched, cooled, quickly, and, then, harden, over, time, wilm, had, been, searching, for, a, way, to, harden, aluminium, alloys, for, use, in, machine, gun, cartridge, cases, knowing, that, aluminium, copper, alloys, were, heat, treatable, to, some, degree, wilm, tried, quenching, a, ternary, alloy, of, aluminium, copper, and, the, addition, of, magnesium, but, was, initially, disappointed, with, the, results, however, when, wilm, retested, it, the, next, day, he, discovered, that, the, alloy, increased, in, hardness, when, left, to, age, at, room, temperature, and, far, exceeded, his, expectations, although, an, explanation, for, the, phenomenon, was, not, provided, until, 1919, duralumin, was, one, of, the, first, age, hardening, alloys, used, becoming, the, primary, building, material, for, the, first, zeppelins, and, was, soon, followed, by, many, others, because, they, often, exhibit, a, combination, of, high, strength, and, low, weight, these, alloys, became, widely, used, in, many, forms, of, industry, including, the, construction, of, modern, aircraft, when, a, molten, metal, is, mixed, with, another, substance, there, are, two, mechanisms, that, can, cause, an, alloy, to, form, called, atom, exchange, and, the, interstitial, mechanism, the, relative, size, of, each, element, in, the, mix, plays, a, primary, role, in, determining, which, mechanism, will, occur, when, the, atoms, are, relatively, similar, in, size, the, atom, exchange, method, usually, happens, where, some, of, the, atoms, composing, the, metallic, crystals, are, substituted, with, atoms, of, the, other, constituent, this, is, called, a, substitutional, alloy, examples, of, substitutional, alloys, include, bronze, and, brass, in, which, some, of, the, copper, atoms, are, substituted, with, either, tin, or, zinc, atoms, respectively, in, the, case, of, the, interstitial, mechanism, one, atom, is, usually, much, smaller, than, the, other, and, can, not, successfully, substitute, for, the, other, type, of, atom, in, the, crystals, of, the, base, metal, instead, the, smaller, atoms, become, trapped, in, the, interstitial, sites, between, the, atoms, of, the, crystal, matrix, this, is, referred, to, as, an, interstitial, alloy, steel, is, an, example, of, an, interstitial, alloy, because, the, very, small, carbon, atoms, fit, into, interstices, of, the, iron, matrix, stainless, steel, is, an, example, of, a, combination, of, interstitial, and, substitutional, alloys, because, the, carbon, atoms, fit, into, the, interstices, but, some, of, the, iron, atoms, are, substituted, by, nickel, and, chromium, atoms, the, use, of, alloys, by, humans, started, with, the, use, of, meteoric, iron, a, naturally, occurring, alloy, of, nickel, and, iron, it, is, the, main, constituent, of, iron, meteorites, as, no, metallurgic, processes, were, used, to, separate, iron, from, nickel, the, alloy, was, used, as, it, was, meteoric, iron, could, be, forged, from, a, red, heat, to, make, objects, such, as, tools, weapons, and, nails, in, many, cultures, it, was, shaped, by, cold, hammering, into, knives, and, arrowheads, they, were, often, used, as, anvils, meteoric, iron, was, very, rare, and, valuable, and, difficult, for, ancient, people, to, work, iron, is, usually, found, as, iron, ore, on, earth, except, for, one, deposit, of, native, iron, in, greenland, which, was, used, by, the, inuit, native, copper, however, was, found, worldwide, along, with, silver, gold, and, platinum, which, were, also, used, to, make, tools, jewelry, and, other, objects, since, neolithic, times, copper, was, the, hardest, of, these, metals, and, the, most, widely, distributed, it, became, one, of, the, most, important, metals, to, the, ancients, around, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, highlands, of, anatolia, turkey, humans, learned, to, smelt, metals, such, as, copper, and, tin, from, ore, around, 2500, bc, people, began, alloying, the, two, metals, to, form, bronze, which, was, much, harder, than, its, ingredients, tin, was, rare, however, being, found, mostly, in, great, britain, in, the, middle, east, people, began, alloying, copper, with, zinc, to, form, brass, ancient, civilizations, took, into, account, the, mixture, and, the, various, properties, it, produced, such, as, hardness, toughness, and, melting, point, under, various, conditions, of, temperature, and, work, hardening, developing, much, of, the, information, contained, in, modern, alloy, phase, diagrams, for, example, arrowheads, from, the, chinese, qin, dynasty, around, 200, bc, were, often, constructed, with, a, hard, bronze, head, but, a, softer, bronze, tang, combining, the, alloys, to, prevent, both, dulling, and, breaking, during, use, mercury, has, been, smelted, from, cinnabar, for, thousands, of, years, mercury, dissolves, many, metals, such, as, gold, silver, and, tin, to, form, amalgams, an, alloy, in, a, soft, paste, or, liquid, form, at, ambient, temperature, amalgams, have, been, used, since, 200, bc, in, china, for, gilding, objects, such, as, armor, and, mirrors, with, precious, metals, the, ancient, romans, often, used, mercury, tin, amalgams, for, gilding, their, armor, the, amalgam, was, applied, as, a, paste, and, then, heated, until, the, mercury, vaporized, leaving, the, gold, silver, or, tin, behind, mercury, was, often, used, in, mining, to, extract, precious, metals, like, gold, and, silver, from, their, ores, many, ancient, civilizations, alloyed, metals, for, purely, aesthetic, purposes, in, ancient, egypt, and, mycenae, gold, was, often, alloyed, with, copper, to, produce, red, gold, or, iron, to, produce, a, bright, burgundy, gold, gold, was, often, found, alloyed, with, silver, or, other, metals, to, produce, various, types, of, colored, gold, these, metals, were, also, used, to, strengthen, each, other, for, more, practical, purposes, copper, was, often, added, to, silver, to, make, sterling, silver, increasing, its, strength, for, use, in, dishes, silverware, and, other, practical, items, quite, often, precious, metals, were, alloyed, with, less, valuable, substances, as, a, means, to, deceive, buyers, around, 250, bc, archimedes, was, commissioned, by, the, king, of, syracuse, to, find, a, way, to, check, the, purity, of, the, gold, in, a, crown, leading, to, the, famous, bath, house, shouting, of, eureka, upon, the, discovery, of, archimedes, principle, the, term, pewter, covers, a, variety, of, alloys, consisting, primarily, of, tin, as, a, pure, metal, tin, is, much, too, soft, to, use, for, most, practical, purposes, however, during, the, bronze, age, tin, was, a, rare, metal, in, many, parts, of, europe, and, the, mediterranean, so, it, was, often, valued, higher, than, gold, to, make, jewellery, cutlery, or, other, objects, from, tin, workers, usually, alloyed, it, with, other, metals, to, increase, strength, and, hardness, these, metals, were, typically, lead, antimony, bismuth, or, copper, these, solutes, were, sometimes, added, individually, in, varying, amounts, or, added, together, making, a, wide, variety, of, objects, ranging, from, practical, items, such, as, dishes, surgical, tools, candlesticks, or, funnels, to, decorative, items, like, ear, rings, and, hair, clips, the, earliest, examples, of, pewter, come, from, ancient, egypt, around, 1450, bc, the, use, of, pewter, was, widespread, across, europe, from, france, to, norway, and, britain, where, most, of, the, ancient, tin, was, mined, to, the, near, east, the, alloy, was, also, used, in, china, and, the, far, east, arriving, in, japan, around, 800, ad, where, it, was, used, for, making, objects, like, ceremonial, vessels, tea, canisters, or, chalices, used, in, shinto, shrines, the, first, known, smelting, of, iron, began, in, anatolia, around, 1800, bc, called, the, bloomery, process, it, produced, very, soft, but, ductile, wrought, iron, by, 800, bc, iron, making, technology, had, spread, to, europe, arriving, in, japan, around, 700, ad, pig, iron, a, very, hard, but, brittle, alloy, of, iron, and, carbon, was, being, produced, in, china, as, early, as, 1200, bc, but, did, not, arrive, in, europe, until, the, middle, ages, pig, iron, has, a, lower, melting, point, than, iron, and, was, used, for, making, cast, iron, however, these, metals, found, little, practical, use, until, the, introduction, of, crucible, steel, around, 300, bc, these, steels, were, of, poor, quality, and, the, introduction, of, pattern, welding, around, the, 1st, century, ad, sought, to, balance, the, extreme, properties, of, the, alloys, by, laminating, them, to, create, a, tougher, metal, around, 700, ad, the, japanese, began, folding, bloomery, steel, and, cast, iron, in, alternating, layers, to, increase, the, strength, of, their, swords, using, clay, fluxes, to, remove, slag, and, impurities, this, method, of, japanese, swordsmithing, produced, one, of, the, purest, steel, alloys, of, the, ancient, world, while, the, use, of, iron, started, to, become, more, widespread, around, 1200, bc, mainly, because, of, interruptions, in, the, trade, routes, for, tin, the, metal, was, much, softer, than, bronze, however, very, small, amounts, of, steel, an, alloy, of, iron, and, around, 1, carbon, was, always, a, byproduct, of, the, bloomery, process, the, ability, to, modify, the, hardness, of, steel, by, heat, treatment, had, been, known, since, 1100, bc, and, the, rare, material, was, valued, for, the, manufacture, of, tools, and, weapons, because, the, ancients, could, not, produce, temperatures, high, enough, to, melt, iron, fully, the, production, of, steel, in, decent, quantities, did, not, occur, until, the, introduction, of, blister, steel, during, the, middle, ages, this, method, introduced, carbon, by, heating, wrought, iron, in, charcoal, for, long, periods, of, time, but, the, absorption, of, carbon, in, this, manner, is, extremely, slow, thus, the, penetration, was, not, very, deep, so, the, alloy, was, not, homogeneous, in, 1740, benjamin, huntsman, began, melting, blister, steel, in, a, crucible, to, even, out, the, carbon, content, creating, the, first, process, for, the, mass, production, of, tool, steel, huntsman, s, process, was, used, for, manufacturing, tool, steel, until, the, early, 1900s, the, introduction, of, the, blast, furnace, to, europe, in, the, middle, ages, meant, that, people, could, produce, pig, iron, in, much, higher, volumes, than, wrought, iron, because, pig, iron, could, be, melted, people, began, to, develop, processes, to, reduce, carbon, in, liquid, pig, iron, to, create, steel, puddling, had, been, used, in, china, since, the, first, century, and, was, introduced, in, europe, during, the, 1700s, where, molten, pig, iron, was, stirred, while, exposed, to, the, air, to, remove, the, carbon, by, oxidation, in, 1858, henry, bessemer, developed, a, process, of, steel, making, by, blowing, hot, air, through, liquid, pig, iron, to, reduce, the, carbon, content, the, bessemer, process, led, to, the, first, large, scale, manufacture, of, steel, steel, is, an, alloy, of, iron, and, carbon, but, the, term, alloy, steel, usually, only, refers, to, steels, that, contain, other, elements, like, vanadium, molybdenum, or, cobalt, in, amounts, sufficient, to, alter, the, properties, of, the, base, steel, since, ancient, times, when, steel, was, used, primarily, for, tools, and, weapons, the, methods, of, producing, and, working, the, metal, were, often, closely, guarded, secrets, even, long, after, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, steel, industry, was, very, competitive, and, manufacturers, went, through, great, lengths, to, keep, their, processes, confidential, resisting, any, attempts, to, scientifically, analyze, the, material, for, fear, it, would, reveal, their, methods, for, example, the, people, of, sheffield, a, center, of, steel, production, in, england, were, known, to, routinely, bar, visitors, and, tourists, from, entering, town, to, deter, industrial, espionage, thus, almost, no, metallurgical, information, existed, about, steel, until, 1860, because, of, this, lack, of, understanding, steel, was, not, generally, considered, an, alloy, until, the, decades, between, 1930, and, 1970, primarily, due, to, the, work, of, scientists, like, william, chandler, roberts, austen, adolf, martens, and, edgar, bain, so, alloy, steel, became, the, popular, term, for, ternary, and, quaternary, steel, alloys, after, benjamin, huntsman, developed, his, crucible, steel, in, 1740, he, began, experimenting, with, the, addition, of, elements, like, manganese, in, the, form, of, a, high, manganese, pig, iron, called, spiegeleisen, which, helped, remove, impurities, such, as, phosphorus, and, oxygen, a, process, adopted, by, bessemer, and, still, used, in, modern, steels, albeit, in, concentrations, low, enough, to, still, be, considered, carbon, steel, afterward, many, people, began, experimenting, with, various, alloys, of, steel, without, much, success, however, in, 1882, robert, hadfield, being, a, pioneer, in, steel, metallurgy, took, an, interest, and, produced, a, steel, alloy, containing, around, 12, manganese, called, mangalloy, it, exhibited, extreme, hardness, and, toughness, becoming, the, first, commercially, viable, alloy, steel, afterward, he, created, silicon, steel, launching, the, search, for, other, possible, alloys, of, steel, robert, forester, mushet, found, that, by, adding, tungsten, to, steel, it, could, produce, a, very, hard, edge, that, would, resist, losing, its, hardness, at, high, temperatures, r, mushet, s, special, steel, rms, became, the, first, high, speed, steel, mushet, s, steel, was, quickly, replaced, by, tungsten, carbide, steel, developed, by, taylor, and, white, in, 1900, in, which, they, doubled, the, tungsten, content, and, added, small, amounts, of, chromium, and, vanadium, producing, a, superior, steel, for, use, in, lathes, and, machining, tools, in, 1903, the, wright, brothers, used, a, chromium, nickel, steel, to, make, the, crankshaft, for, their, airplane, engine, while, in, 1908, henry, ford, began, using, vanadium, steels, for, parts, like, crankshafts, and, valves, in, his, model, t, ford, due, to, their, higher, strength, and, resistance, to, high, temperatures, in, 1912, the, krupp, ironworks, in, germany, developed, a, rust, resistant, steel, by, adding, 21, chromium, and, 7, nickel, producing, the, first, stainless, steel, due, to, their, high, reactivity, most, metals, were, not, discovered, until, the, 19th, century, a, method, for, extracting, aluminium, from, bauxite, was, proposed, by, humphry, davy, in, 1807, using, an, electric, arc, although, his, attempts, were, unsuccessful, by, 1855, the, first, sales, of, pure, aluminium, reached, the, market, however, as, extractive, metallurgy, was, still, in, its, infancy, most, aluminium, extraction, processes, produced, unintended, alloys, contaminated, with, other, elements, found, in, the, ore, the, most, abundant, of, which, was, copper, these, aluminium, copper, alloys, at, the, time, termed, aluminum, bronze, preceded, pure, aluminium, offering, greater, strength, and, hardness, over, the, soft, pure, metal, and, to, a, slight, degree, were, found, to, be, heat, treatable, however, due, to, their, softness, and, limited, hardenability, these, alloys, found, little, practical, use, and, were, more, of, a, novelty, until, the, wright, brothers, used, an, aluminium, alloy, to, construct, the, first, airplane, engine, in, 1903, during, the, time, between, 1865, and, 1910, processes, for, extracting, many, other, metals, were, discovered, such, as, chromium, vanadium, tungsten, iridium, cobalt, and, molybdenum, and, various, alloys, were, developed, prior, to, 1910, research, mainly, consisted, of, private, individuals, tinkering, in, their, own, laboratories, however, as, the, aircraft, and, automotive, industries, began, growing, research, into, alloys, became, an, industrial, effort, in, the, years, following, 1910, as, new, magnesium, alloys, were, developed, for, pistons, and, wheels, in, cars, and, pot, metal, for, levers, and, knobs, and, aluminium, alloys, developed, for, airframes, and, aircraft, skins, were, put, into, use, the, doehler, die, casting, co, of, toledo, ohio, were, known, for, the, production, of, brastil, a, high, tensile, corrosion, resistant, bronze, alloy
