an, amalgam, is, an, alloy, of, mercury, with, another, metal, it, may, be, a, liquid, a, soft, paste, or, a, solid, depending, upon, the, proportion, of, mercury, these, alloys, are, formed, through, metallic, bonding, with, the, electrostatic, attractive, force, of, the, conduction, electrons, working, to, bind, all, the, positively, charged, metal, ions, together, into, a, crystal, lattice, structure, almost, all, metals, can, form, amalgams, with, mercury, the, notable, exceptions, being, iron, platinum, tungsten, and, tantalum, silver, mercury, amalgams, are, important, in, dentistry, and, gold, mercury, amalgam, is, used, in, the, extraction, of, gold, from, ore, dentistry, has, used, alloys, of, mercury, with, metals, such, as, silver, copper, indium, tin, and, zinc, zinc, amalgam, finds, use, in, organic, synthesis, e, g, for, the, clemmensen, reduction, it, is, the, reducing, agent, in, the, jones, reductor, used, in, analytical, chemistry, formerly, the, zinc, plates, of, dry, batteries, were, amalgamated, with, a, small, amount, of, mercury, to, prevent, deterioration, in, storage, it, is, a, binary, solution, liquid, solid, of, mercury, and, zinc, for, the, alkali, metals, amalgamation, is, exothermic, and, distinct, chemical, forms, can, be, identified, such, as, khg, and, khg, 2, khg, is, a, gold, coloured, compound, with, a, melting, point, of, 178, c, and, khg, 2, a, silver, coloured, compound, with, a, melting, point, of, 278, c, these, amalgams, are, very, sensitive, to, air, and, water, but, can, be, worked, with, under, dry, nitrogen, the, hg, hg, distance, is, around, 300, picometres, hg, k, around, 358, pm, phases, k, 5, hg, 7, and, khg, 11, are, also, known, rubidium, strontium, and, barium, undecamercurides, are, known, and, isostructural, sodium, amalgam, nahg, 2, has, a, different, structure, with, the, mercury, atoms, forming, hexagonal, layers, and, the, sodium, atoms, a, linear, chain, which, fits, into, the, holes, in, the, hexagonal, layers, but, the, potassium, atom, is, too, large, for, this, structure, to, work, in, khg, 2, sodium, amalgam, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, the, chloralkali, process, and, used, as, an, important, reducing, agent, in, organic, and, inorganic, chemistry, with, water, it, decomposes, into, concentrated, sodium, hydroxide, solution, hydrogen, and, mercury, which, can, then, return, to, the, chloralkali, process, anew, if, absolutely, water, free, alcohol, is, used, instead, of, water, an, alkoxide, of, sodium, is, produced, instead, of, the, alkali, solution, aluminium, can, form, an, amalgam, through, a, reaction, with, mercury, aluminium, amalgam, may, be, prepared, by, either, grinding, aluminium, pellets, or, wire, in, mercury, or, by, allowing, aluminium, wire, or, foil, to, react, with, a, solution, of, mercuric, chloride, this, amalgam, is, used, as, a, reagent, to, reduce, compounds, such, as, the, reduction, of, imines, to, amines, the, aluminium, is, the, ultimate, electron, donor, and, the, mercury, serves, to, mediate, the, electron, transfer, the, reaction, itself, and, the, waste, from, it, contain, mercury, so, special, safety, precautions, and, disposal, methods, are, needed, as, an, environmentally, friendlier, alternative, hydrides, or, other, reducing, agents, can, often, be, used, to, accomplish, the, same, synthetic, result, another, environmentally, friendly, alternative, is, an, alloy, of, aluminium, and, gallium, which, similarly, renders, the, aluminium, more, reactive, by, preventing, it, from, forming, an, oxide, layer, tin, amalgam, was, used, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, as, a, reflective, mirror, coating, a, variety, of, amalgams, are, known, that, are, of, interest, mainly, in, the, research, context, dentistry, has, used, alloys, of, mercury, with, metals, such, as, silver, copper, indium, tin, and, zinc, amalgam, is, an, excellent, and, versatile, restorative, material, and, is, used, in, dentistry, for, a, number, of, reasons, it, is, inexpensive, and, relatively, easy, to, use, and, manipulate, during, placement, it, remains, soft, for, a, short, time, so, it, can, be, packed, to, fill, any, irregular, volume, and, then, forms, a, hard, compound, amalgam, possesses, greater, longevity, when, compared, to, other, direct, restorative, materials, such, as, composite, however, this, difference, has, decreased, with, continual, development, of, composite, resins, amalgam, is, typically, compared, to, resin, based, composites, because, many, applications, are, similar, and, many, physical, properties, and, costs, are, comparable, dental, amalgam, has, been, studied, and, is, generally, considered, to, be, safe, for, humans, though, the, validity, of, some, studies, and, their, conclusions, have, been, questioned, in, july, 2018, the, eu, in, consideration, of, the, persistent, pollution, and, environmental, toxicity, of, amalgam, s, mercury, prohibited, amalgam, for, dental, treatment, of, children, under, 15, years, and, of, pregnant, or, breastfeeding, women, mercury, has, been, used, in, gold, and, silver, mining, because, of, the, convenience, and, the, ease, with, which, mercury, and, the, precious, metals, will, amalgamate, in, gold, placer, mining, in, which, minute, specks, of, gold, are, washed, from, sand, or, gravel, deposits, mercury, was, often, used, to, separate, the, gold, from, other, heavy, minerals, after, all, of, the, practical, metal, had, been, taken, out, from, the, ore, the, mercury, was, dispensed, down, a, long, copper, trough, which, formed, a, thin, coating, of, mercury, on, the, exterior, the, waste, ore, was, then, transferred, down, the, trough, and, gold, in, the, waste, amalgamated, with, the, mercury, this, coating, would, then, be, scraped, off, and, refined, by, evaporation, to, get, rid, of, the, mercury, leaving, behind, somewhat, high, purity, gold, mercury, amalgamation, was, first, used, on, silver, ores, with, the, development, of, the, patio, process, in, mexico, in, 1557, there, were, also, additional, amalgamation, processes, that, were, created, for, processing, silver, ores, including, pan, amalgamation, and, the, washoe, process, gold, amalgam, has, proved, effective, where, gold, fines, flour, gold, would, not, be, extractable, from, ore, using, hydro, mechanical, methods, large, amounts, of, mercury, were, used, in, placer, mining, where, deposits, composed, largely, of, decomposed, granite, slurry, were, separated, in, long, runs, of, riffle, boxes, with, mercury, dumped, in, at, the, head, of, the, run, the, amalgam, formed, is, a, heavy, solid, mass, of, dull, gray, color, the, use, of, mercury, in, 19th, century, placer, mining, in, california, now, prohibited, has, caused, extensive, pollution, problems, in, riverine, and, estuarine, environments, ongoing, to, this, day, sometimes, substantial, slugs, of, amalgam, are, found, in, downstream, river, and, creek, bottoms, by, amateur, wet, suited, miners, seeking, gold, nuggets, with, the, aid, of, an, engine, powered, water, vacuum, dredge, mounted, on, a, float, where, stamp, mills, were, used, to, crush, gold, bearing, ore, to, fines, a, part, of, the, extraction, process, involved, the, use, of, mercury, wetted, copper, plates, over, which, the, crushed, fines, were, washed, a, periodic, scraping, and, re, mercurizing, of, the, plate, resulted, in, amalgam, for, further, processing, amalgam, obtained, by, either, process, was, then, heated, in, a, distillation, retort, recovering, the, mercury, for, reuse, and, leaving, behind, the, gold, as, this, released, mercury, vapors, to, the, atmosphere, the, process, could, induce, adverse, health, effects, and, long, term, pollution, today, mercury, amalgamation, has, been, replaced, by, other, methods, to, recuperate, gold, and, silver, from, ore, in, developed, nations, hazards, of, mercurial, toxic, waste, have, played, a, major, role, in, the, phasing, out, of, the, mercury, amalgamation, processes, however, mercury, amalgamation, is, still, regularly, used, by, small, scale, gold, placer, miners, often, illegally, particularly, in, developing, countries, mercury, salts, are, compared, to, mercury, metal, and, amalgams, highly, toxic, due, to, their, solubility, in, water, the, presence, of, these, salts, in, water, can, be, detected, with, a, probe, that, uses, the, readiness, of, mercury, ions, to, form, an, amalgam, with, copper, a, nitric, acid, solution, of, salts, under, investigation, is, applied, to, a, piece, of, copper, foil, and, any, mercury, ions, present, will, leave, spots, of, silvery, coloured, amalgam, silver, ions, leave, similar, spots, but, are, easily, washed, away, making, this, a, means, of, distinguishing, silver, from, mercury, the, redox, reaction, involved, where, mercury, oxidizes, the, copper, is
