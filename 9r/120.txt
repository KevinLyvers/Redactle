rigel, is, a, blue, supergiant, star, in, the, constellation, of, orion, it, has, the, bayer, designation, orionis, which, is, latinized, to, beta, orionis, and, abbreviated, beta, ori, or, ori, rigel, is, the, brightest, and, most, massive, component, and, the, eponym, of, a, star, system, of, at, least, four, stars, that, appear, as, a, single, blue, white, point, of, light, to, the, naked, eye, this, system, is, located, at, a, distance, of, approximately, 860, light, years, 260, pc, from, the, sun, a, star, of, spectral, type, b8ia, rigel, is, calculated, to, be, anywhere, from, 61, 500, to, 363, 000, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, and, 18, to, 24, times, as, massive, depending, on, the, method, and, assumptions, used, its, radius, is, more, than, seventy, times, that, of, the, sun, and, its, surface, temperature, is, 12, 100, k, due, to, its, stellar, wind, rigel, s, mass, loss, is, estimated, to, be, ten, million, times, that, of, the, sun, with, an, estimated, age, of, seven, to, nine, million, years, rigel, has, exhausted, its, core, hydrogen, fuel, expanded, and, cooled, to, become, a, supergiant, it, is, expected, to, end, its, life, as, a, type, ii, supernova, leaving, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, as, a, final, remnant, depending, on, the, initial, mass, of, the, star, rigel, varies, slightly, in, brightness, its, apparent, magnitude, ranging, from, 0, 05, to, 0, 18, it, is, classified, as, an, alpha, cygni, variable, due, to, the, amplitude, and, periodicity, of, its, brightness, variation, as, well, as, its, spectral, type, its, intrinsic, variability, is, caused, by, pulsations, in, its, unstable, atmosphere, rigel, is, generally, the, seventh, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, the, brightest, star, in, orion, though, it, is, occasionally, outshone, by, betelgeuse, which, varies, over, a, larger, range, a, triple, star, system, is, separated, from, rigel, by, an, angle, of, 9, 5, arc, seconds, it, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 6, 7, making, it, 1, 400th, as, bright, as, rigel, two, stars, in, the, system, can, be, seen, by, large, telescopes, and, the, brighter, of, the, two, is, a, spectroscopic, binary, these, three, stars, are, all, blue, white, main, sequence, stars, each, three, to, four, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, rigel, and, the, triple, system, orbit, a, common, center, of, gravity, with, a, period, estimated, to, be, 24, 000, years, the, inner, stars, of, the, triple, system, orbit, each, other, every, 10, days, and, the, outer, star, orbits, the, inner, pair, every, 63, years, a, much, fainter, star, separated, from, rigel, and, the, others, by, nearly, an, arc, minute, may, be, part, of, the, same, star, system, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, included, the, name, rigel, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, according, to, the, iau, this, proper, name, applies, only, to, the, primary, component, a, of, the, rigel, system, the, system, is, listed, variously, in, historical, astronomical, catalogs, as, h, ii, 33, 668, 555, or, ads, 3823, for, simplicity, rigel, s, companions, are, referred, to, as, rigel, b, c, and, d, the, iau, describes, such, names, as, useful, nicknames, that, are, unofficial, in, modern, comprehensive, catalogs, the, whole, multiple, star, system, is, known, as, wds, 05145, 0812, or, ccdm, 05145, 0812, the, designation, of, rigel, as, orionis, latinized, to, beta, orionis, was, made, by, johann, bayer, in, 1603, the, beta, designation, is, commonly, given, to, the, second, brightest, star, in, each, constellation, but, rigel, is, almost, always, brighter, than, orionis, betelgeuse, astronomer, james, b, kaler, has, speculated, that, rigel, was, designated, by, bayer, during, a, rare, period, when, it, was, outshone, by, the, variable, star, betelgeuse, resulting, in, the, latter, star, being, designated, alpha, and, rigel, designated, beta, bayer, did, not, strictly, order, the, stars, by, brightness, instead, grouping, them, by, magnitude, rigel, and, betelgeuse, were, both, considered, to, be, of, the, first, magnitude, class, and, in, orion, the, stars, of, each, class, are, thought, to, have, been, ordered, north, to, south, rigel, is, included, in, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, but, since, it, already, has, a, bayer, designation, it, has, no, separate, variable, star, designation, rigel, has, many, other, stellar, designations, taken, from, various, catalogs, including, the, flamsteed, designation, 19, orionis, 19, ori, the, bright, star, catalogue, entry, hr, 1713, and, the, henry, draper, catalogue, number, hd, 34085, these, designations, frequently, appear, in, the, scientific, literature, but, rarely, in, popular, writing, rigel, is, an, intrinsic, variable, star, with, an, apparent, magnitude, ranging, from, 0, 05, to, 0, 18, it, is, typically, the, seventh, brightest, star, in, the, celestial, sphere, excluding, the, sun, although, occasionally, fainter, than, betelgeuse, rigel, appears, slightly, blue, white, and, has, a, b, v, color, index, of, 0, 06, it, contrasts, strongly, with, reddish, betelgeuse, culminating, every, year, at, midnight, on, 12, december, and, at, 9, 00, pm, on, 24, january, rigel, is, visible, on, winter, evenings, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, on, summer, evenings, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, the, southern, hemisphere, rigel, is, the, first, bright, star, of, orion, visible, as, the, constellation, rises, correspondingly, it, is, also, the, first, star, of, orion, to, set, in, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, star, is, a, vertex, of, the, winter, hexagon, an, asterism, that, includes, aldebaran, capella, pollux, procyon, and, sirius, rigel, is, a, prominent, equatorial, navigation, star, being, easily, located, and, readily, visible, in, all, the, world, s, oceans, the, exception, is, the, area, north, of, the, 82nd, parallel, north, rigel, s, spectral, type, is, a, defining, point, of, the, classification, sequence, for, supergiants, the, overall, spectrum, is, typical, for, a, late, b, class, star, with, strong, absorption, lines, of, the, hydrogen, balmer, series, as, well, as, neutral, helium, lines, and, some, of, heavier, elements, such, as, oxygen, calcium, and, magnesium, the, luminosity, class, for, b8, stars, is, estimated, from, the, strength, and, narrowness, of, the, hydrogen, spectral, lines, and, rigel, is, assigned, to, the, bright, supergiant, class, ia, variations, in, the, spectrum, have, resulted, in, the, assignment, of, different, classes, to, rigel, such, as, b8, ia, b8, iab, and, b8, iae, as, early, as, 1888, the, heliocentric, radial, velocity, of, rigel, as, estimated, from, the, doppler, shifts, of, its, spectral, lines, was, seen, to, vary, this, was, confirmed, and, interpreted, at, the, time, as, being, due, to, a, spectroscopic, companion, with, a, period, of, about, 22, days, the, radial, velocity, has, since, been, measured, to, vary, by, about, 10, km, s, around, a, mean, of, 21, 5, km, s, in, 1933, the, h, line, in, rigel, s, spectrum, was, seen, to, be, unusually, weak, and, shifted, 0, 1, nm, towards, shorter, wavelengths, while, there, was, a, narrow, emission, spike, about, 1, 5, nm, to, the, long, wavelength, side, of, the, main, absorption, line, this, is, now, known, as, a, p, cygni, profile, after, a, star, that, shows, this, feature, strongly, in, its, spectrum, it, is, associated, with, mass, loss, where, there, is, simultaneously, emission, from, a, dense, wind, close, to, the, star, and, absorption, from, circumstellar, material, expanding, away, from, the, star, the, unusual, h, line, profile, is, observed, to, vary, unpredictably, it, is, a, normal, absorption, line, around, a, third, of, the, time, about, a, quarter, of, the, time, it, is, a, double, peaked, line, that, is, an, absorption, line, with, an, emission, core, or, an, emission, line, with, an, absorption, core, about, a, quarter, of, the, time, it, has, a, p, cygni, profile, most, of, the, rest, of, the, time, the, line, has, an, inverse, p, cygni, profile, where, the, emission, component, is, on, the, short, wavelength, side, of, the, line, rarely, there, is, a, pure, emission, h, line, the, line, profile, changes, are, interpreted, as, variations, in, the, quantity, and, velocity, of, material, being, expelled, from, the, star, occasional, very, high, velocity, outflows, have, been, inferred, and, more, rarely, infalling, material, the, overall, picture, is, one, of, large, looping, structures, arising, from, the, photosphere, and, driven, by, magnetic, fields, rigel, has, been, known, to, vary, in, brightness, since, at, least, 1930, the, small, amplitude, of, rigel, s, brightness, variation, requires, photoelectric, or, ccd, photometry, to, be, reliably, detected, this, brightness, variation, has, no, obvious, period, observations, over, 18, nights, in, 1984, showed, variations, at, red, blue, and, yellow, wavelengths, of, up, to, 0, 13, magnitudes, on, timescales, of, a, few, hours, to, several, days, but, again, no, clear, period, rigel, s, color, index, varies, slightly, but, this, is, not, significantly, correlated, with, its, brightness, variations, from, analysis, of, hipparcos, satellite, photometry, rigel, is, identified, as, belonging, to, the, alpha, cygni, class, of, variable, stars, defined, as, non, radially, pulsating, supergiants, of, the, bep, aepia, spectral, types, in, those, spectral, types, the, e, indicates, that, it, displays, emission, lines, in, its, spectrum, while, the, p, means, it, has, an, unspecified, spectral, peculiarity, alpha, cygni, type, variables, are, generally, considered, to, be, irregular, or, have, quasi, periods, rigel, was, added, to, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, in, the, 74th, name, list, of, variable, stars, on, the, basis, of, the, hipparcos, photometry, which, showed, variations, with, a, photographic, amplitude, of, 0, 039, magnitudes, and, a, possible, period, of, 2, 075, days, rigel, was, observed, with, the, canadian, most, satellite, for, nearly, 28, days, in, 2009, milli, magnitude, variations, were, observed, and, gradual, changes, in, flux, suggest, the, presence, of, long, period, pulsation, modes, from, observations, of, the, variable, h, spectral, line, rigel, s, mass, loss, rate, due, to, stellar, wind, is, estimated, be, 1, 5, 0, 4, 10, 7, solar, masses, per, year, m, yr, about, ten, million, times, more, than, the, mass, loss, rate, from, the, sun, more, detailed, optical, and, k, band, infrared, spectroscopic, observations, together, with, vlti, interferometry, were, taken, from, 2006, to, 2010, analysis, of, the, h, and, h, line, profiles, and, measurement, of, the, regions, producing, the, lines, show, that, rigel, s, stellar, wind, varies, greatly, in, structure, and, strength, loop, and, arm, structures, were, also, detected, within, the, wind, calculations, of, mass, loss, from, the, h, line, give, 9, 4, 0, 9, 10, 7, m, yr, in, 2006, 7, and, 7, 6, 1, 1, 10, 7, m, yr, in, 2009, 10, calculations, using, the, h, line, give, lower, results, around, 1, 5, 10, 7, m, yr, the, terminal, wind, velocity, is, 300, km, s, it, is, estimated, that, rigel, has, lost, about, three, solar, masses, m, since, beginning, life, as, a, star, of, 24, 3, m, seven, to, nine, million, years, ago, rigel, s, distance, from, the, sun, is, somewhat, uncertain, different, estimates, being, obtained, by, different, methods, old, estimates, placed, it, 166, parsecs, or, 541, light, years, away, from, the, sun, the, 2007, hipparcos, new, reduction, of, rigel, s, parallax, is, 3, 78, 0, 34, mas, giving, a, distance, of, 863, light, years, 265, parsecs, with, a, margin, of, error, of, about, 9, rigel, b, usually, considered, to, be, physically, associated, with, rigel, and, at, the, same, distance, has, a, gaia, data, release, 3, parallax, of, 3, 2352, 0, 0553, mas, suggesting, a, distance, around, 1, 000, light, years, 310, parsecs, however, the, measurements, for, this, object, may, be, unreliable, indirect, distance, estimation, methods, have, also, been, employed, for, example, rigel, is, believed, to, be, in, a, region, of, nebulosity, its, radiation, illuminating, several, nearby, clouds, most, notable, of, these, is, the, 5, long, ic, 2118, witch, head, nebula, located, at, an, angular, separation, of, 2, 5, from, the, star, or, a, projected, distance, of, 39, light, years, 12, parsecs, away, from, measures, of, other, nebula, embedded, stars, ic, 2118, s, distance, is, estimated, to, be, 949, 7, light, years, 291, 2, parsecs, rigel, is, an, outlying, member, of, the, orion, ob1, association, which, is, located, at, a, distance, of, up, to, 1, 600, light, years, 500, parsecs, from, earth, it, is, a, member, of, the, loosely, defined, taurus, orion, r1, association, somewhat, closer, at, 1, 200, light, years, 360, parsecs, rigel, is, thought, to, be, considerably, closer, than, most, of, the, members, of, orion, ob1, and, the, orion, nebula, betelgeuse, and, saiph, lie, at, a, similar, distance, to, rigel, although, betelgeuse, is, a, runaway, star, with, a, complex, history, and, might, have, originally, formed, in, the, main, body, of, the, association, hierarchical, scheme, for, rigel, s, components, the, star, system, of, which, rigel, is, a, part, has, at, least, four, components, rigel, sometimes, called, rigel, a, to, distinguish, from, the, other, components, has, a, visual, companion, which, is, likely, a, close, triple, star, system, a, fainter, star, at, a, wider, separation, might, be, a, fifth, component, of, the, rigel, system, william, herschel, discovered, rigel, to, be, a, visual, double, star, on, 1, october, 1781, cataloguing, it, as, star, 33, in, the, second, class, of, double, stars, in, his, catalogue, of, double, stars, usually, abbreviated, to, h, ii, 33, or, as, h, 2, 33, in, the, washington, double, star, catalogue, friedrich, georg, wilhelm, von, struve, first, measured, the, relative, position, of, the, companion, in, 1822, cataloguing, the, visual, pair, as, 668, the, secondary, star, is, often, referred, to, as, rigel, b, or, orionis, b, the, angular, separation, of, rigel, b, from, rigel, a, is, 9, 5, arc, seconds, to, its, south, along, position, angle, 204, although, not, particularly, faint, at, visual, magnitude, 6, 7, the, overall, difference, in, brightness, from, rigel, a, about, 6, 6, magnitudes, or, 440, times, fainter, makes, it, a, challenging, target, for, telescope, apertures, smaller, than, 15, cm, 6, in, at, rigel, s, estimated, distance, rigel, b, s, projected, separation, from, rigel, a, is, over, 2, 200, astronomical, units, au, since, its, discovery, there, has, been, no, sign, of, orbital, motion, although, both, stars, share, a, similar, common, proper, motion, the, pair, would, have, an, estimated, orbital, period, of, 24, 000, years, gaia, data, release, 2, dr2, contains, a, somewhat, unreliable, parallax, for, rigel, b, placing, it, at, about, 1, 100, light, years, 340, parsecs, further, away, than, the, hipparcos, distance, for, rigel, but, similar, to, the, taurus, orion, r1, association, there, is, no, parallax, for, rigel, in, gaia, dr2, the, gaia, dr2, proper, motions, for, rigel, b, and, the, hipparcos, proper, motions, for, rigel, are, both, small, although, not, quite, the, same, in, 1871, sherburne, wesley, burnham, suspected, rigel, b, to, be, a, binary, system, and, in, 1878, he, resolved, it, into, two, components, this, visual, companion, is, designated, as, component, c, rigel, c, with, a, measured, separation, from, component, b, that, varies, from, less, than, 0, 1, to, around, 0, 3, in, 2009, speckle, interferometry, showed, the, two, almost, identical, components, separated, by, 0, 124, with, visual, magnitudes, of, 7, 5, and, 7, 6, respectively, their, estimated, orbital, period, is, 63, years, burnham, listed, the, rigel, multiple, system, as, 555, in, his, double, star, catalog, or, bu, 555, in, modern, use, component, b, is, a, double, lined, spectroscopic, binary, system, which, shows, two, sets, of, spectral, lines, combined, within, its, single, stellar, spectrum, periodic, changes, observed, in, relative, positions, of, these, lines, indicate, an, orbital, period, of, 9, 86, days, the, two, spectroscopic, components, rigel, ba, and, rigel, bb, cannot, be, resolved, in, optical, telescopes, but, are, known, to, both, be, hot, stars, of, spectral, type, around, b9, this, spectroscopic, binary, together, with, the, close, visual, component, rigel, c, is, likely, a, physical, triple, star, system, although, rigel, c, cannot, be, detected, in, the, spectrum, which, is, inconsistent, with, its, observed, brightness, in, 1878, burnham, found, another, possibly, associated, star, of, approximately, 13th, magnitude, he, listed, it, as, component, d, of, 555, although, it, is, unclear, whether, it, is, physically, related, or, a, coincidental, alignment, its, 2017, separation, from, rigel, was, 44, 5, almost, due, north, at, a, position, angle, of, 1, gaia, dr2, finds, it, to, be, a, 12th, magnitude, sunlike, star, at, approximately, the, same, distance, as, rigel, likely, a, k, type, main, sequence, star, this, star, would, have, an, orbital, period, of, around, 250, 000, years, if, it, is, part, of, the, rigel, system, a, spectroscopic, companion, to, rigel, was, reported, on, the, basis, of, radial, velocity, variations, and, its, orbit, was, even, calculated, but, subsequent, work, suggests, the, star, does, not, exist, and, that, observed, pulsations, are, intrinsic, to, rigel, itself, rigel, is, a, blue, supergiant, that, has, exhausted, the, hydrogen, fuel, in, its, core, expanded, and, cooled, as, it, moved, away, from, the, main, sequence, across, the, upper, part, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, when, it, was, on, the, main, sequence, its, effective, temperature, would, have, been, around, 30, 000, k, rigel, s, complex, variability, at, visual, wavelengths, is, caused, by, stellar, pulsations, similar, to, those, of, deneb, further, observations, of, radial, velocity, variations, indicate, that, it, simultaneously, oscillates, in, at, least, 19, non, radial, modes, with, periods, ranging, from, about, 1, 2, to, 74, days, estimation, of, many, physical, characteristics, of, blue, supergiant, stars, including, rigel, is, challenging, due, to, their, rarity, and, uncertainty, about, how, far, they, are, from, the, sun, as, such, their, characteristics, are, mainly, estimated, from, theoretical, stellar, evolution, models, its, effective, temperature, can, be, estimated, from, the, spectral, type, and, color, to, be, around, 12, 100, k, a, mass, of, 21, 3, m, at, an, age, of, 8, 1, million, years, has, been, estimated, by, comparing, evolutionary, tracks, while, atmospheric, modeling, from, the, spectrum, gives, a, mass, of, 24, 8, m, although, rigel, is, often, considered, the, most, luminous, star, within, 1, 000, light, years, of, the, sun, its, energy, output, is, poorly, known, using, the, hipparcos, distance, of, 860, light, years, 264, parsecs, the, estimated, relative, luminosity, for, rigel, is, about, 120, 000, times, that, of, the, sun, l, but, another, recently, published, distance, of, 1, 170, 130, light, years, 360, 40, parsecs, suggests, an, even, higher, luminosity, of, 219, 000, l, other, calculations, based, on, theoretical, stellar, evolutionary, models, of, rigel, s, atmosphere, give, luminosities, anywhere, between, 83, 000, l, and, 363, 000, l, while, summing, the, spectral, energy, distribution, from, historical, photometry, with, the, hipparcos, distance, suggests, a, luminosity, as, low, as, 61, 515, 11, 486, l, a, 2018, study, using, the, navy, precision, optical, interferometer, measured, the, angular, diameter, as, 2, 526, mas, after, correcting, for, limb, darkening, the, angular, diameter, is, found, to, be, 2, 606, 0, 009, mas, yielding, a, radius, of, 74, 1, 6, 1, 7, 3, r, an, older, measurement, of, the, angular, diameter, gives, 2, 75, 0, 01, mas, equivalent, to, a, radius, of, 78, 9, r, at, 264, pc, these, radii, are, calculated, assuming, the, hipparcos, distance, of, 264, pc, adopting, a, distance, of, 360, pc, leads, to, a, significantly, larger, size, older, distance, estimates, were, mostly, far, lower, than, modern, estimates, leading, to, lower, radius, estimates, a, 1922, estimate, by, john, stanley, plaskett, gave, rigel, a, diameter, of, 25, million, miles, or, approximately, 28, 9, r, smaller, than, its, neighbor, aldebaran, due, to, their, closeness, to, each, other, and, ambiguity, of, the, spectrum, little, is, known, about, the, intrinsic, properties, of, the, members, of, the, rigel, bc, triple, system, all, three, stars, seem, to, be, near, equally, hot, b, type, main, sequence, stars, that, are, three, to, four, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, stellar, evolution, models, suggest, the, pulsations, of, rigel, are, powered, by, nuclear, reactions, in, a, hydrogen, burning, shell, that, is, at, least, partially, non, convective, these, pulsations, are, stronger, and, more, numerous, in, stars, that, have, evolved, through, a, red, supergiant, phase, and, then, increased, in, temperature, to, again, become, a, blue, supergiant, this, is, due, to, the, decreased, mass, and, increased, levels, of, fusion, products, at, the, surface, of, the, star, rigel, is, likely, to, be, fusing, helium, in, its, core, due, to, strong, convection, of, helium, produced, in, the, core, while, rigel, was, on, the, main, sequence, and, in, the, hydrogen, burning, shell, since, it, became, a, supergiant, the, fraction, of, helium, at, the, surface, has, increased, from, 26, 6, when, the, star, formed, to, 32, now, the, surface, abundances, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, seen, in, the, spectrum, are, compatible, with, a, post, red, supergiant, star, only, if, its, internal, convection, zones, are, modeled, using, non, homogeneous, chemical, conditions, known, as, the, ledoux, criteria, rigel, is, expected, to, eventually, end, its, stellar, life, as, a, type, ii, supernova, it, is, one, of, the, closest, known, potential, supernova, progenitors, to, earth, and, would, be, expected, to, have, a, maximum, apparent, magnitude, of, around, 11, about, the, same, brightness, as, a, quarter, moon, or, around, 300, times, brighter, than, venus, ever, gets, the, supernova, would, leave, behind, either, a, black, hole, or, a, neutron, star, the, earliest, known, recording, of, the, name, rigel, is, in, the, alfonsine, tables, of, 1521, it, is, derived, from, the, arabic, name, rijl, jauzah, al, yusr, the, left, leg, foot, of, jauzah, i, e, rijl, meaning, leg, foot, which, can, be, traced, to, the, 10th, century, jauzah, was, a, proper, name, for, orion, an, alternative, arabic, name, was, rijl,
