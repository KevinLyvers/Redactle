the, interplanetary, medium, ipm, or, interplanetary, space, consists, of, the, mass, and, energy, which, fills, the, solar, system, and, through, which, all, the, larger, solar, system, bodies, such, as, planets, dwarf, planets, asteroids, and, comets, move, the, ipm, stops, at, the, heliopause, outside, of, which, the, interstellar, medium, begins, before, 1950, interplanetary, space, was, widely, considered, to, either, be, an, empty, vacuum, or, consisting, of, aether, the, interplanetary, medium, includes, interplanetary, dust, cosmic, rays, and, hot, plasma, from, the, solar, wind, the, density, of, the, interplanetary, medium, is, very, low, decreasing, in, inverse, proportion, to, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, sun, it, is, variable, and, may, be, affected, by, magnetic, fields, and, events, such, as, coronal, mass, ejections, typical, particle, densities, in, the, interplanetary, medium, are, about, 5, 40, particles, cm, 3, but, exhibit, substantial, variation, figure, 1, in, the, vicinity, of, the, earth, it, contains, about, 5, particles, cm, 3, 326, but, values, as, high, as, 100, particles, cm, 3, have, been, observed, figure, 2, the, temperature, of, the, interplanetary, medium, varies, through, the, solar, system, joseph, fourier, estimated, that, interplanetary, medium, must, have, temperatures, comparable, to, those, observed, at, earth, s, poles, but, on, faulty, grounds, lacking, modern, estimates, of, atmospheric, heat, transport, he, saw, no, other, means, to, explain, the, relative, consistency, of, earth, s, climate, a, very, hot, interplanetary, medium, remained, a, minor, position, among, geophysicists, as, late, as, 1959, when, chapman, proposed, a, temperature, on, the, order, of, 10000, k, but, observation, in, low, earth, orbit, of, the, exosphere, soon, contradicted, his, position, in, fact, both, fourier, and, chapman, s, final, predictions, were, correct, because, the, interplanetary, medium, is, so, rarefied, it, does, not, exhibit, thermodynamic, equilibrium, instead, different, components, have, different, temperatures, 4, the, solar, wind, exhibits, temperatures, consistent, with, chapman, s, estimate, in, cislunar, space, 326, 329, and, dust, particles, near, earth, s, orbit, exhibit, temperatures, 257, 298, k, 3, 77, f, 157, averaging, about, 283, k, 50, f, in, general, the, solar, wind, temperature, decreases, proportional, to, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, to, the, sun, the, temperature, of, the, dust, decreases, proportional, to, the, inverse, cube, root, of, the, distance, 157, for, dust, particles, within, the, asteroid, belt, typical, temperatures, range, from, 200, k, 100, f, at, 2, 2, au, down, to, 165, k, 163, f, at, 3, 2, au, since, the, interplanetary, medium, is, a, plasma, or, gas, of, ions, the, interplanetary, medium, has, the, characteristics, of, a, plasma, rather, than, a, simple, gas, for, example, it, carries, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, with, it, is, highly, electrically, conductive, resulting, in, the, heliospheric, current, sheet, forms, plasma, double, layers, where, it, comes, into, contact, with, a, planetary, magnetosphere, or, at, the, heliopause, and, exhibits, filamentation, such, as, in, aurorae, the, plasma, in, the, interplanetary, medium, is, also, responsible, for, the, strength, of, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, at, the, orbit, of, the, earth, being, over, 100, times, greater, than, originally, anticipated, if, space, were, a, vacuum, then, the, sun, s, 10, 4, tesla, magnetic, dipole, field, would, reduce, with, the, cube, of, the, distance, to, about, 10, 11, tesla, but, satellite, observations, show, that, it, is, about, 100, times, greater, at, around, 10, 9, tesla, magnetohydrodynamic, mhd, theory, predicts, that, the, motion, of, a, conducting, fluid, e, g, the, interplanetary, medium, in, a, magnetic, field, induces, electric, currents, which, in, turn, generate, magnetic, fields, and, in, this, respect, it, behaves, like, an, mhd, dynamo, the, outer, edge, of, the, heliosphere, is, the, boundary, between, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, and, the, interstellar, medium, this, boundary, is, known, as, the, heliopause, and, is, believed, to, be, a, fairly, sharp, transition, of, the, order, of, 110, to, 160, astronomical, units, from, the, sun, the, interplanetary, medium, thus, fills, the, roughly, spherical, volume, contained, within, the, heliopause, how, the, interplanetary, medium, interacts, with, planets, depends, on, whether, they, have, magnetic, fields, or, not, bodies, such, as, the, moon, have, no, magnetic, field, and, the, solar, wind, can, impact, directly, on, their, surface, over, billions, of, years, the, lunar, regolith, has, acted, as, a, collector, for, solar, wind, particles, and, so, studies, of, rocks, from, the, lunar, surface, can, be, valuable, in, studies, of, the, solar, wind, high, energy, particles, from, the, solar, wind, impacting, on, the, lunar, surface, also, cause, it, to, emit, faintly, at, x, ray, wavelengths, planets, with, their, own, magnetic, field, such, as, the, earth, and, jupiter, are, surrounded, by, a, magnetosphere, within, which, their, magnetic, field, is, dominant, over, the, sun, s, this, disrupts, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, which, is, channelled, around, the, magnetosphere, material, from, the, solar, wind, can, leak, into, the, magnetosphere, causing, aurorae, and, also, populating, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, with, ionised, material, the, interplanetary, medium, is, responsible, for, several, optical, phenomena, visible, from, earth, zodiacal, light, is, a, broad, band, of, faint, light, sometimes, seen, after, sunset, and, before, sunrise, stretched, along, the, ecliptic, and, appearing, brightest, near, the, horizon, this, glow, is, caused, by, sunlight, scattered, by, dust, particles, in, the, interplanetary, medium, between, earth, and, the, sun, a, similar, phenomenon, centered, at, the, antisolar, point, gegenschein, is, visible, in, a, naturally, dark, moonless, night, sky, much, fainter, than, zodiacal, light, this, effect, is, caused, by, sunlight, backscattered, by, dust, particles, beyond, earth, s, orbit, the, term, interplanetary, appears, to, have, been, first, used, in, print, in, 1691, by, the, scientist, robert, boyle, the, air, is, different, from, the, ther, or, vacuum, in, the, interplanetary, spaces, boyle, hist, air, in, 1898, american, astronomer, charles, augustus, young, wrote, inter, planetary, space, is, a, vacuum, far, more, perfect, than, anything, we, can, produce, by, artificial, means, the, elements, of, astronomy, charles, augustus, young, 1898, the, notion, that, space, is, considered, to, be, a, vacuum, filled, with, an, aether, or, just, a, cold, dark, vacuum, continued, up, until, the, 1950s, tufts, university, professor, of, astronomy, kenneth, r, lang, writing, in, 2000, noted, half, a, century, ago, most, people, visualized, our, planet, as, a, solitary, sphere, traveling, in, a, cold, dark, vacuum, of, space, around, the, sun, in, 2002, akasofu, stated, the, view, that, interplanetary, space, is, a, vacuum, into, which, the, sun, intermittently, emitted, corpuscular, streams, was, changed, radically, by, ludwig, biermann, 1951, 1953, who, proposed, on, the, basis, of, comet, tails, that, the, sun, continuously, blows, its, atmosphere, out, in, all, directions, at, supersonic, speed, syun, ichi, akasofu, exploring, the, secrets, of, the, aurora, 2002
