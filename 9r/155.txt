a, solar, eclipse, occurs, when, the, moon, passes, between, earth, and, the, sun, thereby, obscuring, the, view, of, the, sun, from, a, small, part, of, earth, totally, or, partially, such, an, alignment, occurs, approximately, every, six, months, during, the, eclipse, season, in, its, new, moon, phase, when, the, moon, s, orbital, plane, is, closest, to, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, in, a, total, eclipse, the, disk, of, the, sun, is, fully, obscured, by, the, moon, in, partial, and, annular, eclipses, only, part, of, the, sun, is, obscured, unlike, a, lunar, eclipse, which, may, be, viewed, from, anywhere, on, the, night, side, of, earth, a, solar, eclipse, can, only, be, viewed, from, a, relatively, small, area, of, the, world, as, such, although, total, solar, eclipses, occur, somewhere, on, earth, every, 18, months, on, average, they, recur, at, any, given, place, only, once, every, 360, to, 410, years, if, the, moon, were, in, a, perfectly, circular, orbit, and, in, the, same, orbital, plane, as, earth, there, would, be, total, solar, eclipses, once, a, month, at, every, new, moon, instead, because, the, moon, s, orbit, is, tilted, at, about, 5, degrees, to, earth, s, orbit, its, shadow, usually, misses, earth, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, therefore, happen, only, during, eclipse, seasons, resulting, in, at, least, two, and, up, to, five, solar, eclipses, each, year, no, more, than, two, of, which, can, be, total, total, eclipses, are, rarer, because, they, require, a, more, precise, alignment, between, the, centers, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, because, the, moon, s, apparent, size, in, the, sky, is, sometimes, too, small, to, fully, cover, the, sun, an, eclipse, is, a, natural, phenomenon, in, some, ancient, and, modern, cultures, solar, eclipses, were, attributed, to, supernatural, causes, or, regarded, as, bad, omens, astronomers, predictions, of, eclipses, began, in, china, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, eclipses, hundreds, of, years, into, the, future, may, now, be, predicted, with, high, accuracy, looking, directly, at, the, sun, can, lead, to, permanent, eye, damage, so, special, eye, protection, or, indirect, viewing, techniques, are, used, when, viewing, a, solar, eclipse, only, the, total, phase, of, a, total, solar, eclipse, is, safe, to, view, without, protection, enthusiasts, known, as, eclipse, chasers, or, umbraphiles, travel, to, remote, locations, to, see, solar, eclipses, the, sun, s, distance, from, earth, is, about, 400, times, the, moon, s, distance, and, the, sun, s, diameter, is, about, 400, times, the, moon, s, diameter, because, these, ratios, are, approximately, the, same, the, sun, and, the, moon, as, seen, from, earth, appear, to, be, approximately, the, same, size, about, 0, 5, degree, of, arc, in, angular, measure, the, moon, s, orbit, around, earth, is, slightly, elliptical, as, is, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, the, apparent, sizes, of, the, sun, and, moon, therefore, vary, the, magnitude, of, an, eclipse, is, the, ratio, of, the, apparent, size, of, the, moon, to, the, apparent, size, of, the, sun, during, an, eclipse, an, eclipse, that, occurs, when, the, moon, is, near, its, closest, distance, to, earth, i, e, near, its, perigee, can, be, a, total, eclipse, because, the, moon, will, appear, to, be, large, enough, to, completely, cover, the, sun, s, bright, disk, or, photosphere, a, total, eclipse, has, a, magnitude, greater, than, or, equal, to, 1, 000, conversely, an, eclipse, that, occurs, when, the, moon, is, near, its, farthest, distance, from, earth, i, e, near, its, apogee, can, be, only, an, annular, eclipse, because, the, moon, will, appear, to, be, slightly, smaller, than, the, sun, the, magnitude, of, an, annular, eclipse, is, less, than, 1, because, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, is, also, elliptical, earth, s, distance, from, the, sun, similarly, varies, throughout, the, year, this, affects, the, apparent, size, of, the, sun, in, the, same, way, but, not, as, much, as, does, the, moon, s, varying, distance, from, earth, when, earth, approaches, its, farthest, distance, from, the, sun, in, early, july, a, total, eclipse, is, somewhat, more, likely, whereas, conditions, favour, an, annular, eclipse, when, earth, approaches, its, closest, distance, to, the, sun, in, early, january, there, are, three, main, types, of, solar, eclipses, a, total, eclipse, occurs, on, average, every, 18, months, when, the, dark, silhouette, of, the, moon, completely, obscures, the, bright, light, of, the, sun, allowing, the, much, fainter, solar, corona, to, be, visible, during, an, eclipse, totality, occurs, only, along, a, narrow, track, on, the, surface, of, earth, this, narrow, track, is, called, the, path, of, totality, an, annular, eclipse, like, a, total, eclipse, occurs, when, the, sun, and, moon, are, exactly, in, line, with, earth, during, an, annular, eclipse, however, the, apparent, size, of, the, moon, is, not, large, enough, to, completely, block, out, the, sun, totality, thus, does, not, occur, the, sun, instead, appears, as, a, very, bright, ring, or, annulus, surrounding, the, dark, disk, of, the, moon, annular, eclipses, occur, once, every, one, or, two, years, not, annually, the, term, derives, from, the, latin, root, word, anulus, meaning, ring, rather, than, annus, for, year, a, partial, eclipse, occurs, about, twice, a, year, when, the, sun, and, moon, are, not, exactly, in, line, with, earth, and, the, moon, only, partially, obscures, the, sun, this, phenomenon, can, usually, be, seen, from, a, large, part, of, earth, outside, of, the, track, of, an, annular, or, total, eclipse, however, some, eclipses, can, be, seen, only, as, a, partial, eclipse, because, the, umbra, passes, above, earth, s, polar, regions, and, never, intersects, earth, s, surface, partial, eclipses, are, virtually, unnoticeable, in, terms, of, the, sun, s, brightness, as, it, takes, well, over, 90, coverage, to, notice, any, darkening, at, all, even, at, 99, it, would, be, no, darker, than, civil, twilight, a, hybrid, eclipse, also, called, annular, total, eclipse, shifts, between, a, total, and, annular, eclipse, at, certain, points, on, the, surface, of, earth, it, appears, as, a, total, eclipse, whereas, at, other, points, it, appears, as, annular, hybrid, eclipses, are, comparatively, rare, a, hybrid, eclipse, occurs, when, the, magnitude, of, an, eclipse, changes, during, the, event, from, less, to, greater, than, one, so, the, eclipse, appears, to, be, total, at, locations, nearer, the, midpoint, and, annular, at, other, locations, nearer, the, beginning, and, end, since, the, sides, of, earth, are, slightly, further, away, from, the, moon, these, eclipses, are, extremely, narrow, in, their, path, width, and, relatively, short, in, their, duration, at, any, point, compared, with, fully, total, eclipses, the, 2023, april, 20, hybrid, eclipse, s, totality, is, over, a, minute, in, duration, at, various, points, along, the, path, of, totality, like, a, focal, point, the, width, and, duration, of, totality, and, annularity, are, near, zero, at, the, points, where, the, changes, between, the, two, occur, central, eclipse, is, often, used, as, a, generic, term, for, a, total, annular, or, hybrid, eclipse, this, is, however, not, completely, correct, the, definition, of, a, central, eclipse, is, an, eclipse, during, which, the, central, line, of, the, umbra, touches, earth, s, surface, it, is, possible, though, extremely, rare, that, part, of, the, umbra, intersects, with, earth, thus, creating, an, annular, or, total, eclipse, but, not, its, central, line, this, is, then, called, a, non, central, total, or, annular, eclipse, gamma, is, a, measure, of, how, centrally, the, shadow, strikes, the, last, umbral, yet, non, central, solar, eclipse, was, on, april, 29, 2014, this, was, an, annular, eclipse, the, next, non, central, total, solar, eclipse, will, be, on, april, 9, 2043, the, visual, phases, observed, during, a, total, eclipse, are, called, the, diagrams, to, the, right, show, the, alignment, of, the, sun, moon, and, earth, during, a, solar, eclipse, the, dark, gray, region, between, the, moon, and, earth, is, the, umbra, where, the, sun, is, completely, obscured, by, the, moon, the, small, area, where, the, umbra, touches, earth, s, surface, is, where, a, total, eclipse, can, be, seen, the, larger, light, gray, area, is, the, penumbra, in, which, a, partial, eclipse, can, be, seen, an, observer, in, the, antumbra, the, area, of, shadow, beyond, the, umbra, will, see, an, annular, eclipse, the, moon, s, orbit, around, earth, is, inclined, at, an, angle, of, just, over, 5, degrees, to, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, the, ecliptic, because, of, this, at, the, time, of, a, new, moon, the, moon, will, usually, pass, to, the, north, or, south, of, the, sun, a, solar, eclipse, can, occur, only, when, a, new, moon, occurs, close, to, one, of, the, points, known, as, nodes, where, the, moon, s, orbit, crosses, the, ecliptic, as, noted, above, the, moon, s, orbit, is, also, elliptical, the, moon, s, distance, from, earth, varies, by, up, to, about, 5, 9, from, its, average, value, therefore, the, moon, s, apparent, size, varies, with, its, distance, from, earth, and, it, is, this, effect, that, leads, to, the, difference, between, total, and, annular, eclipses, the, distance, of, earth, from, the, sun, also, varies, during, the, year, but, this, is, a, smaller, effect, by, up, to, about, 0, 85, from, its, average, value, on, average, the, moon, appears, to, be, slightly, 2, 1, smaller, than, the, sun, as, seen, from, earth, so, the, majority, about, 60, of, central, eclipses, are, annular, it, is, only, when, the, moon, is, closer, to, earth, than, average, near, its, perigee, that, a, total, eclipse, occurs, the, moon, orbits, earth, in, approximately, 27, 3, days, relative, to, a, fixed, frame, of, reference, this, is, known, as, the, sidereal, month, however, during, one, sidereal, month, earth, has, revolved, part, way, around, the, sun, making, the, average, time, between, one, new, moon, and, the, next, longer, than, the, sidereal, month, it, is, approximately, 29, 5, days, this, is, known, as, the, synodic, month, and, corresponds, to, what, is, commonly, called, the, lunar, month, the, moon, crosses, from, south, to, north, of, the, ecliptic, at, its, ascending, node, and, vice, versa, at, its, descending, node, however, the, nodes, of, the, moon, s, orbit, are, gradually, moving, in, a, retrograde, motion, due, to, the, action, of, the, sun, s, gravity, on, the, moon, s, motion, and, they, make, a, complete, circuit, every, 18, 6, years, this, regression, means, that, the, time, between, each, passage, of, the, moon, through, the, ascending, node, is, slightly, shorter, than, the, sidereal, month, this, period, is, called, the, nodical, or, draconic, month, finally, the, moon, s, perigee, is, moving, forwards, or, precessing, in, its, orbit, and, makes, a, complete, circuit, in, 8, 85, years, the, time, between, one, perigee, and, the, next, is, slightly, longer, than, the, sidereal, month, and, known, as, the, anomalistic, month, the, moon, s, orbit, intersects, with, the, ecliptic, at, the, two, nodes, that, are, 180, degrees, apart, therefore, the, new, moon, occurs, close, to, the, nodes, at, two, periods, of, the, year, approximately, six, months, 173, 3, days, apart, known, as, eclipse, seasons, and, there, will, always, be, at, least, one, solar, eclipse, during, these, periods, sometimes, the, new, moon, occurs, close, enough, to, a, node, during, two, consecutive, months, to, eclipse, the, sun, on, both, occasions, in, two, partial, eclipses, this, means, that, in, any, given, year, there, will, always, be, at, least, two, solar, eclipses, and, there, can, be, as, many, as, five, eclipses, can, occur, only, when, the, sun, is, within, about, 15, to, 18, degrees, of, a, node, 10, to, 12, degrees, for, central, eclipses, this, is, referred, to, as, an, eclipse, limit, and, is, given, in, ranges, because, the, apparent, sizes, and, speeds, of, the, sun, and, moon, vary, throughout, the, year, in, the, time, it, takes, for, the, moon, to, return, to, a, node, draconic, month, the, apparent, position, of, the, sun, has, moved, about, 29, degrees, relative, to, the, nodes, since, the, eclipse, limit, creates, a, window, of, opportunity, of, up, to, 36, degrees, 24, degrees, for, central, eclipses, it, is, possible, for, partial, eclipses, or, rarely, a, partial, and, a, central, eclipse, to, occur, in, consecutive, months, during, a, central, eclipse, the, moon, s, umbra, or, antumbra, in, the, case, of, an, annular, eclipse, moves, rapidly, from, west, to, east, across, earth, earth, is, also, rotating, from, west, to, east, at, about, 28, km, min, at, the, equator, but, as, the, moon, is, moving, in, the, same, direction, as, earth, s, rotation, at, about, 61, km, min, the, umbra, almost, always, appears, to, move, in, a, roughly, west, east, direction, across, a, map, of, earth, at, the, speed, of, the, moon, s, orbital, velocity, minus, earth, s, rotational, velocity, the, width, of, the, track, of, a, central, eclipse, varies, according, to, the, relative, apparent, diameters, of, the, sun, and, moon, in, the, most, favourable, circumstances, when, a, total, eclipse, occurs, very, close, to, perigee, the, track, can, be, up, to, 267, km, 166, mi, wide, and, the, duration, of, totality, may, be, over, 7, minutes, outside, of, the, central, track, a, partial, eclipse, is, seen, over, a, much, larger, area, of, earth, typically, the, umbra, is, 100, 160, km, wide, while, the, penumbral, diameter, is, in, excess, of, 6400, km, besselian, elements, are, used, to, predict, whether, an, eclipse, will, be, partial, annular, or, total, or, annular, total, and, what, the, eclipse, circumstances, will, be, at, any, given, location, chapter, 11, calculations, with, besselian, elements, can, determine, the, exact, shape, of, the, umbra, s, shadow, on, earth, s, surface, but, at, what, longitudes, on, earth, s, surface, the, shadow, will, fall, is, a, function, of, earth, s, rotation, and, on, how, much, that, rotation, has, slowed, down, over, time, a, number, called, t, is, used, in, eclipse, prediction, to, take, this, slowing, into, account, as, earth, slows, t, increases, t, for, dates, in, the, future, can, only, be, roughly, estimated, because, earth, s, rotation, is, slowing, irregularly, this, means, that, although, it, is, possible, to, predict, that, there, will, be, a, total, eclipse, on, a, certain, date, in, the, far, future, it, is, not, possible, to, predict, in, the, far, future, exactly, at, what, longitudes, that, eclipse, will, be, total, historical, records, of, eclipses, allow, estimates, of, past, values, of, t, and, so, of, earth, s, rotation, equation, 11, 132, the, following, factors, determine, the, duration, of, a, total, solar, eclipse, in, order, of, decreasing, importance, the, longest, eclipse, that, has, been, calculated, thus, far, is, the, eclipse, of, july, 16, 2186, with, a, maximum, duration, of, 7, minutes, 29, seconds, over, northern, guyana, a, total, solar, eclipse, is, a, rare, event, recurring, somewhere, on, earth, every, 18, months, on, average, yet, is, estimated, to, recur, at, any, given, location, only, every, 360, 410, years, on, average, the, total, eclipse, lasts, for, only, a, maximum, of, a, few, minutes, at, any, location, because, the, moon, s, umbra, moves, eastward, at, over, 1700, km, h, 1100, mph, 470, m, s, 1500, ft, s, totality, currently, can, never, last, more, than, 7, min, 32, s, this, value, changes, over, the, millennia, and, is, currently, decreasing, by, the, 8th, millennium, the, longest, theoretically, possible, total, eclipse, will, be, less, than, 7, min, 2, s, the, last, time, an, eclipse, longer, than, 7, minutes, occurred, was, june, 30, 1973, 7, min, 3, sec, observers, aboard, a, concorde, supersonic, aircraft, were, able, to, stretch, totality, for, this, eclipse, to, about, 74, minutes, by, flying, along, the, path, of, the, moon, s, umbra, the, next, total, eclipse, exceeding, seven, minutes, in, duration, will, not, occur, until, june, 25, 2150, the, longest, total, solar, eclipse, during, the, 11, 000, year, period, from, 3000, bc, to, at, least, 8000, ad, will, occur, on, july, 16, 2186, when, totality, will, last, 7, min, 29, s, for, comparison, the, longest, total, eclipse, of, the, 20th, century, at, 7, min, 8, s, occurred, on, june, 20, 1955, and, there, will, be, no, total, solar, eclipses, over, 7, min, in, duration, in, the, 21st, century, it, is, possible, to, predict, other, eclipses, using, eclipse, cycles, the, saros, is, probably, the, best, known, and, one, of, the, most, accurate, a, saros, lasts, 6585, 3, days, a, little, over, 18, years, which, means, that, after, this, period, a, practically, identical, eclipse, will, occur, the, most, notable, difference, will, be, a, westward, shift, of, about, 120, in, longitude, due, to, the, 0, 3, days, and, a, little, in, latitude, north, south, for, odd, numbered, cycles, the, reverse, for, even, numbered, ones, a, saros, series, always, starts, with, a, partial, eclipse, near, one, of, earth, s, polar, regions, then, shifts, over, the, globe, through, a, series, of, annular, or, total, eclipses, and, ends, with, a, partial, eclipse, at, the, opposite, polar, region, a, saros, series, lasts, 1226, to, 1550, years, and, 69, to, 87, eclipses, with, about, 40, to, 60, of, them, being, central, between, two, and, five, solar, eclipses, occur, every, year, with, at, least, one, per, eclipse, season, since, the, gregorian, calendar, was, instituted, in, 1582, years, that, have, had, five, solar, eclipses, were, 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and, 1935, the, next, occurrence, will, be, 2206, on, average, there, are, about, 240, solar, eclipses, each, century, total, solar, eclipses, are, seen, on, earth, because, of, a, fortuitous, combination, of, circumstances, even, on, earth, the, diversity, of, eclipses, familiar, to, people, today, is, a, temporary, on, a, geological, time, scale, phenomenon, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, in, the, past, the, moon, was, closer, to, earth, and, therefore, apparently, larger, so, every, solar, eclipse, was, total, or, partial, and, there, were, no, annular, eclipses, due, to, tidal, acceleration, the, orbit, of, the, moon, around, earth, becomes, approximately, 3, 8, cm, more, distant, each, year, millions, of, years, in, the, future, the, moon, will, be, too, far, away, to, fully, occlude, the, sun, and, no, total, eclipses, will, occur, in, the, same, timeframe, the, sun, may, become, brighter, making, it, appear, larger, in, size, estimates, of, the, time, when, the, moon, will, be, unable, to, occlude, the, entire, sun, when, viewed, from, earth, range, between, 650, million, and, 1, 4, billion, years, in, the, future, looking, directly, at, the, photosphere, of, the, sun, the, bright, disk, of, the, sun, itself, even, for, just, a, few, seconds, can, cause, permanent, damage, to, the, retina, of, the, eye, because, of, the, intense, visible, and, invisible, radiation, that, the, photosphere, emits, this, damage, can, result, in, impairment, of, vision, up, to, and, including, blindness, the, retina, has, no, sensitivity, to, pain, and, the, effects, of, retinal, damage, may, not, appear, for, hours, so, there, is, no, warning, that, injury, is, occurring, under, normal, conditions, the, sun, is, so, bright, that, it, is, difficult, to, stare, at, it, directly, however, during, an, eclipse, with, so, much, of, the, sun, covered, it, is, easier, and, more, tempting, to, stare, at, it, looking, at, the, sun, during, an, eclipse, is, as, dangerous, as, looking, at, it, outside, an, eclipse, except, during, the, brief, period, of, totality, when, the, sun, s, disk, is, completely, covered, totality, occurs, only, during, a, total, eclipse, and, only, very, briefly, it, does, not, occur, during, a, partial, or, annular, eclipse, viewing, the, sun, s, disk, through, any, kind, of, optical, aid, binoculars, a, telescope, or, even, an, optical, camera, viewfinder, is, extremely, hazardous, and, can, cause, irreversible, eye, damage, within, a, fraction, of, a, second, viewing, the, sun, during, partial, and, annular, eclipses, and, during, total, eclipses, outside, the, brief, period, of, totality, requires, special, eye, protection, or, indirect, viewing, methods, if, eye, damage, is, to, be, avoided, the, sun, s, disk, can, be, viewed, using, appropriate, filtration, to, block, the, harmful, part, of, the, sun, s, radiation, sunglasses, do, not, make, viewing, the, sun, safe, only, properly, designed, and, certified, solar, filters, should, be, used, for, direct, viewing, of, the, sun, s, disk, especially, self, made, filters, using, common, objects, such, as, a, floppy, disk, removed, from, its, case, a, compact, disc, a, black, colour, slide, film, smoked, glass, etc, must, be, avoided, the, safest, way, to, view, the, sun, s, disk, is, by, indirect, projection, this, can, be, done, by, projecting, an, image, of, the, disk, onto, a, white, piece, of, paper, or, card, using, a, pair, of, binoculars, with, one, of, the, lenses, covered, a, telescope, or, another, piece, of, cardboard, with, a, small, hole, in, it, about, 1, mm, diameter, often, called, a, pinhole, camera, the, projected, image, of, the, sun, can, then, be, safely, viewed, this, technique, can, be, used, to, observe, sunspots, as, well, as, eclipses, care, must, be, taken, however, to, ensure, that, no, one, looks, through, the, projector, telescope, pinhole, etc, directly, a, kitchen, colander, with, small, holes, can, also, be, used, to, project, multiple, images, of, the, partially, eclipsed, sun, onto, the, ground, or, a, viewing, screen, viewing, the, sun, s, disk, on, a, video, display, screen, provided, by, a, video, camera, or, digital, camera, is, safe, although, the, camera, itself, may, be, damaged, by, direct, exposure, to, the, sun, the, optical, viewfinders, provided, with, some, video, and, digital, cameras, are, not, safe, securely, mounting, 14, welder, s, glass, in, front, of, the, lens, and, viewfinder, protects, the, equipment, and, makes, viewing, possible, professional, workmanship, is, essential, because, of, the, dire, consequences, any, gaps, or, detaching, mountings, will, have, in, the, partial, eclipse, path, one, will, not, be, able, to, see, the, corona, or, nearly, complete, darkening, of, the, sky, however, depending, on, how, much, of, the, sun, s, disk, is, obscured, some, darkening, may, be, noticeable, if, three, quarters, or, more, of, the, sun, is, obscured, then, an, effect, can, be, observed, by, which, the, daylight, appears, to, be, dim, as, if, the, sky, were, overcast, yet, objects, still, cast, sharp, shadows, when, the, shrinking, visible, part, of, the, photosphere, becomes, very, small, baily, s, beads, will, occur, these, are, caused, by, the, sunlight, still, being, able, to, reach, earth, through, lunar, valleys, totality, then, begins, with, the, diamond, ring, effect, the, last, bright, flash, of, sunlight, it, is, safe, to, observe, the, total, phase, of, a, solar, eclipse, directly, only, when, the, sun, s, photosphere, is, completely, covered, by, the, moon, and, not, before, or, after, totality, during, this, period, the, sun, is, too, dim, to, be, seen, through, filters, the, sun, s, faint, corona, will, be, visible, and, the, chromosphere, solar, prominences, coronal, streamers, and, possibly, even, a, solar, flare, may, be, seen, at, the, end, of, totality, the, same, effects, will, occur, in, reverse, order, and, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, moon, a, dedicated, group, of, eclipse, chasers, have, pursued, the, observation, of, solar, eclipses, when, they, occur, around, earth, a, person, who, chases, eclipses, is, known, as, an, umbraphile, meaning, shadow, lover, umbraphiles, travel, for, eclipses, and, use, various, tools, to, help, view, the, sun, including, solar, viewing, glasses, also, known, as, eclipse, glasses, as, well, as, telescopes, the, first, known, photograph, of, a, solar, eclipse, was, taken, on, july, 28, 1851, by, johann, julius, friedrich, berkowski, using, the, daguerreotype, process, photographing, an, eclipse, is, possible, with, fairly, common, camera, equipment, in, order, for, the, disk, of, the, sun, moon, to, be, easily, visible, a, fairly, high, magnification, long, focus, lens, is, needed, at, least, 200, mm, for, a, 35, mm, camera, and, for, the, disk, to, fill, most, of, the, frame, a, longer, lens, is, needed, over, 500, mm, as, with, viewing, the, sun, directly, looking, at, it, through, the, optical, viewfinder, of, a, camera, can, produce, damage, to, the, retina, so, care, is, recommended, solar, filters, are, required, for, digital, photography, even, if, an, optical, viewfinder, is, not, used, using, a, camera, s, live, view, feature, or, an, electronic, viewfinder, is, safe, for, the, human, eye, but, the, sun, s, rays, could, potentially, irreparably, damage, digital, image, sensors, unless, the, lens, is, covered, by, a, properly, designed, solar, filter, historical, eclipses, are, a, very, valuable, resource, for, historians, in, that, they, allow, a, few, historical, events, to, be, dated, precisely, from, which, other, dates, and, ancient, calendars, may, be, deduced, the, oldest, recorded, solar, eclipse, was, recorded, on, a, clay, tablet, found, at, ugarit, in, modern, syria, with, two, plausible, dates, usually, cited, 3, may, 1375, bc, or, 5, march, 1223, bc, the, latter, being, favored, by, most, recent, authors, on, the, topic, a, solar, eclipse, of, june, 15, 763, bc, mentioned, in, an, assyrian, text, is, important, for, the, chronology, of, the, ancient, near, east, there, have, been, other, claims, to, date, earlier, eclipses, the, legendary, chinese, king, zhong, kang, supposedly, beheaded, two, astronomers, hsi, and, ho, who, failed, to, predict, an, eclipse, 4000, years, ago, perhaps, the, earliest, still, unproven, claim, is, that, of, archaeologist, bruce, masse, who, putatively, links, an, eclipse, that, occurred, on, may, 10, 2807, bc, with, a, possible, meteor, impact, in, the, indian, ocean, on, the, basis, of, several, ancient, flood, myths, that, mention, a, total, solar, eclipse, eclipses, have, been, interpreted, as, omens, or, portents, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, wrote, that, thales, of, miletus, predicted, an, eclipse, that, occurred, during, a, battle, between, the, medes, and, the, lydians, both, sides, put, down, their, weapons, and, declared, peace, as, a, result, of, the, eclipse, the, exact, eclipse, involved, remains, uncertain, although, the, issue, has, been, studied, by, hundreds, of, ancient, and, modern, authorities, one, likely, candidate, took, place, on, may, 28, 585, bc, probably, near, the, halys, river, in, asia, minor, an, eclipse, recorded, by, herodotus, before, xerxes, departed, for, his, expedition, against, greece, which, is, traditionally, dated, to, 480, bc, was, matched, by, john, russell, hind, to, an, annular, eclipse, of, the, sun, at, sardis, on, february, 17, 478, bc, alternatively, a, partial, eclipse, was, visible, from, persia, on, october, 2, 480, bc, herodotus, also, reports, a, solar, eclipse, at, sparta, during, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, the, date, of, the, eclipse, august, 1, 477, bc, does, not, match, exactly, the, conventional, dates, for, the, invasion, accepted, by, historians, in, ancient, china, where, solar, eclipses, were, known, as, an, eating, of, the, sun, r, sh, the, earliest, records, of, eclipses, date, to, around, 720, bc, the, 4th, century, bc, astronomer, shi, shen, described, the, prediction, of, eclipses, by, using, the, relative, positions, of, the, moon, and, sun, attempts, have, been, made, to, establish, the, exact, date, of, good, friday, by, assuming, that, the, darkness, described, at, jesus, s, crucifixion, was, a, solar, eclipse, this, research, has, not, yielded, conclusive, results, and, good, friday, is, recorded, as, being, at, passover, which, is, held, at, the, time, of, a, full, moon, further, the, darkness, lasted, from, the, sixth, hour, to, the, ninth, or, three, hours, which, is, much, much, longer, than, the, eight, minute, upper, limit, for, any, solar, eclipse, s, totality, contemporary, chronicles, wrote, about, an, eclipse, at, the, beginning, of, may, 664, that, coincided, with, the, beginning, of, the, plague, of, 664, in, the, british, isles, in, the, western, hemisphere, there, are, few, reliable, records, of, eclipses, before, ad, 800, until, the, advent, of, arab, and, monastic, observations, in, the, early, medieval, period, a, solar, eclipse, took, place, on, january, 27, 632, over, arabia, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, muhammad, denied, the, eclipse, had, anything, to, do, with, his, son, dying, earlier, that, day, saying, the, sun, and, the, moon, do, not, eclipse, because, of, the, death, of, someone, from, the, people, but, they, are, two, signs, amongst, the, signs, of, god, the, cairo, astronomer, ibn, yunus, wrote, that, the, calculation, of, eclipses, was, one, of, the, many, things, that, connect, astronomy, with, the, islamic, law, because, it, allowed, knowing, when, a, special, prayer, can, be, made, the, first, recorded, observation, of, the, corona, was, made, in, constantinople, in, ad, 968, the, first, known, telescopic, observation, of, a, total, solar, eclipse, was, made, in, france, in, 1706, nine, years, later, english, astronomer, edmund, halley, accurately, predicted, and, observed, the, solar, eclipse, of, may, 3, 1715, by, the, mid, 19th, century, scientific, understanding, of, the, sun, was, improving, through, observations, of, the, sun, s, corona, during, solar, eclipses, the, corona, was, identified, as, part, of, the, sun, s, atmosphere, in, 1842, and, the, first, photograph, or, daguerreotype, of, a, total, eclipse, was, taken, of, the, solar, eclipse, of, july, 28, 1851, spectroscope, observations, were, made, of, the, solar, eclipse, of, august, 18, 1868, which, helped, to, determine, the, chemical, composition, of, the, sun, john, fiske, summed, up, myths, about, the, solar, eclipse, like, this, in, his, 1872, book, myth, and, myth, makers, the, myth, of, hercules, and, cacus, the, fundamental, idea, is, the, victory, of, the, solar, god, over, the, robber, who, steals, the, light, now, whether, the, robber, carries, off, the, light, in, the, evening, when, indra, has, gone, to, sleep, or, boldly, rears, his, black, form, against, the, sky, during, the, daytime, causing, darkness, to, spread, over, the, earth, would, make, little, difference, to, the, framers, of, the, myth, to, a, chicken, a, solar, eclipse, is, the, same, thing, as, nightfall, and, he, goes, to, roost, accordingly, why, then, should, the, primitive, thinker, have, made, a, distinction, between, the, darkening, of, the, sky, caused, by, black, clouds, and, that, caused, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, he, had, no, more, conception, of, the, scientific, explanation, of, these, phenomena, than, the, chicken, has, of, the, scientific, explanation, of, an, eclipse, for, him, it, was, enough, to, know, that, the, solar, radiance, was, stolen, in, the, one, case, as, in, the, other, and, to, suspect, that, the, same, demon, was, to, blame, for, both, robberies, a, total, solar, eclipse, provides, a, rare, opportunity, to, observe, the, corona, the, outer, layer, of, the, sun, s, atmosphere, normally, this, is, not, visible, because, the, photosphere, is, much, brighter, than, the, corona, according, to, the, point, reached, in, the, solar, cycle, the, corona, may, appear, small, and, symmetric, or, large, and, fuzzy, it, is, very, hard, to, predict, this, in, advance, phenomena, associated, with, eclipses, include, shadow, bands, also, known, as, flying, shadows, which, are, similar, to, shadows, on, the, bottom, of, a, swimming, pool, they, occur, only, just, prior, to, and, after, totality, when, a, narrow, solar, crescent, acts, as, an, anisotropic, light, source, as, the, light, filters, through, leaves, of, trees, during, a, partial, eclipse, the, overlapping, leaves, create, natural, pinholes, displaying, mini, eclipses, on, the, ground, the, observation, of, a, total, solar, eclipse, of, may, 29, 1919, helped, to, confirm, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, by, comparing, the, apparent, distance, between, stars, in, the, constellation, taurus, with, and, without, the, sun, between, them, arthur, eddington, stated, that, the, theoretical, predictions, about, gravitational, lenses, were, confirmed, the, observation, with, the, sun, between, the, stars, was, possible, only, during, totality, since, the, stars, are, then, visible, though, eddington, s, observations, were, near, the, experimental, limits, of, accuracy, at, the, time, work, in, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, confirmed, his, results, there, is, a, long, history, of, observations, of, gravity, related, phenomena, during, solar, eclipses, especially, during, the, period, of, totality, in, 1954, and, again, in, 1959, maurice, allais, reported, observations, of, strange, and, unexplained, movement, during, solar, eclipses, the, reality, of, this, phenomenon, named, the, allais, effect, has, remained, controversial, similarly, in, 1970, saxl, and, allen, observed, the, sudden, change, in, motion, of, a, torsion, pendulum, this, phenomenon, is, called, the, saxl, effect, observation, during, the, 1997, solar, eclipse, by, wang, et, al, suggested, a, possible, gravitational, shielding, effect, which, generated, debate, in, 2002, wang, and, a, collaborator, published, detailed, data, analysis, which, suggested, that, the, phenomenon, still, remains, unexplained, in, principle, the, simultaneous, occurrence, of, a, solar, eclipse, and, a, transit, of, a, planet, is, possible, but, these, events, are, extremely, rare, because, of, their, short, durations, the, next, anticipated, simultaneous, occurrence, of, a, solar, eclipse, and, a, transit, of, mercury, will, be, on, july, 5, 6757, and, a, solar, eclipse, and, a, transit, of, venus, is, expected, on, april, 5, 15, 232, more, common, but, still, infrequent, is, a, conjunction, of, a, planet, especially, but, not, only, mercury, or, venus, at, the, time, of, a, total, solar, eclipse, in, which, event, the, planet, will, be, visible, very, near, the, eclipsed, sun, when, without, the, eclipse, it, would, have, been, lost, in, the, sun, s, glare, at, one, time, some, scientists, hypothesized, that, there, may, be, a, planet, often, given, the, name, vulcan, even, closer, to, the, sun, than, mercury, the, only, way, to, confirm, its, existence, would, have, been, to, observe, it, in, transit, or, during, a, total, solar, eclipse, no, such, planet, was, ever, found, and, general, relativity, has, since, explained, the, observations, that, led, astronomers, to, suggest, that, vulcan, might, exist, artificial, satellites, can, also, pass, in, front, of, the, sun, as, seen, from, earth, but, none, is, large, enough, to, cause, an, eclipse, at, the, altitude, of, the, international, space, station, for, example, an, object, would, need, to, be, about, 3, 35, km, 2, 08, mi, across, to, blot, the, sun, out, entirely, these, transits, are, difficult, to, watch, because, the, zone, of, visibility, is, very, small, the, satellite, passes, over, the, face, of, the, sun, in, about, a, second, typically, as, with, a, transit, of, a, planet, it, will, not, get, dark, observations, of, eclipses, from, spacecraft, or, artificial, satellites, orbiting, above, earth, s, atmosphere, are, not, subject, to, weather, conditions, the, crew, of, gemini, 12, observed, a, total, solar, eclipse, from, space, in, 1966, the, partial, phase, of, the, 1999, total, eclipse, was, visible, from, mir, the, solar, eclipse, of, march, 20, 2015, was, the, first, occurrence, of, an, eclipse, estimated, to, potentially, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, power, system, with, the, electricity, sector, taking, measures, to, mitigate, any, impact, the, continental, europe, and, great, britain, synchronous, areas, were, estimated, to, have, about, 90, gigawatts, of, solar, power, and, it, was, estimated, that, production, would, temporarily, decrease, by, up, to, 34, gw, compared, to, a, clear, sky, day, eclipses, may, cause, the, temperature, to, decrease, by, 3, c, 5, f, with, wind, power, potentially, decreasing, as, winds, are, reduced, by, 0, 7, meters, 2, 3, ft, per, second, in, addition, to, the, drop, in, light, level, and, air, temperature, animals, change, their, behavior, during, totality, for, example, birds, and, squirrels, return, to, their, nests, and, crickets, chirp, eclipses, occur, only, in, the, eclipse, season, when, the, sun, is, close, to, either, the, ascending, or, descending, node, of, the, moon, each, eclipse, is, separated, by, one, five, or, six, lunations, synodic, months, and, the, midpoint, of, each, season, is, separated, by, 173, 3, days, which, is, the, mean, time, for, the, sun, to, travel, from, one, node, to, the, next, the, period, is, a, little, less, than, half, a, calendar, year, because, the, lunar, nodes, slowly,
