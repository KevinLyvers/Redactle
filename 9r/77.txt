https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)
the, gray, symbol, gy, is, the, unit, of, ionizing, radiation, dose, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, defined, as, the, absorption, of, one, joule, of, radiation, energy, per, kilogram, of, matter, it, is, used, as, a, unit, of, the, radiation, quantity, absorbed, dose, that, measures, the, energy, deposited, by, ionizing, radiation, in, a, unit, mass, of, absorbing, material, and, is, used, for, measuring, the, delivered, dose, in, radiotherapy, food, irradiation, and, radiation, sterilization, it, is, important, in, predicting, likely, acute, health, effects, such, as, acute, radiation, syndrome, and, is, used, to, calculate, equivalent, dose, using, the, sievert, which, is, a, measure, of, the, stochastic, health, effect, on, the, human, body, the, gray, is, also, used, in, radiation, metrology, as, a, unit, of, the, radiation, quantity, kerma, defined, as, the, sum, of, the, initial, kinetic, energies, of, all, the, charged, particles, liberated, by, uncharged, ionizing, radiation, in, a, sample, of, matter, per, unit, mass, the, unit, was, named, after, british, physicist, louis, harold, gray, a, pioneer, in, the, measurement, of, x, ray, and, radium, radiation, and, their, effects, on, living, tissue, the, gray, was, adopted, as, part, of, the, international, system, of, units, in, 1975, the, corresponding, cgs, unit, to, the, gray, is, the, rad, equivalent, to, 0, 01, gy, which, remains, common, largely, in, the, united, states, though, strongly, discouraged, in, the, style, guide, for, u, s, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, the, gray, has, a, number, of, fields, of, application, in, measuring, dose, the, measurement, of, absorbed, dose, in, tissue, is, of, fundamental, importance, in, radiobiology, and, radiation, therapy, as, it, is, the, measure, of, the, amount, of, energy, the, incident, radiation, deposits, in, the, target, tissue, the, measurement, of, absorbed, dose, is, a, complex, problem, due, to, scattering, and, absorption, and, many, specialist, dosimeters, are, available, for, these, measurements, and, can, cover, applications, in, 1, d, 2, d, and, 3, d, in, radiation, therapy, the, amount, of, radiation, applied, varies, depending, on, the, type, and, stage, of, cancer, being, treated, for, curative, cases, the, typical, dose, for, a, solid, epithelial, tumor, ranges, from, 60, to, 80, gy, while, lymphomas, are, treated, with, 20, to, 40, gy, preventive, adjuvant, doses, are, typically, around, 45, 60, gy, in, 1, 8, 2, gy, fractions, for, breast, head, and, neck, cancers, the, average, radiation, dose, from, an, abdominal, x, ray, is, 0, 7, millisieverts, 0, 0007, sv, that, from, an, abdominal, ct, scan, is, 8, msv, that, from, a, pelvic, ct, scan, is, 6, mgy, and, that, from, a, selective, ct, scan, of, the, abdomen, and, the, pelvis, is, 14, mgy, the, absorbed, dose, also, plays, an, important, role, in, radiation, protection, as, it, is, the, starting, point, for, calculating, the, stochastic, health, risk, of, low, levels, of, radiation, which, is, defined, as, the, probability, of, cancer, induction, and, genetic, damage, the, gray, measures, the, total, absorbed, energy, of, radiation, but, the, probability, of, stochastic, damage, also, depends, on, the, type, and, energy, of, the, radiation, and, the, types, of, tissues, involved, this, probability, is, related, to, the, equivalent, dose, in, sieverts, sv, which, has, the, same, dimensions, as, the, gray, it, is, related, to, the, gray, by, weighting, factors, described, in, the, articles, on, equivalent, dose, and, effective, dose, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, states, in, order, to, avoid, any, risk, of, confusion, between, the, absorbed, dose, d, and, the, dose, equivalent, h, the, special, names, for, the, respective, units, should, be, used, that, is, the, name, gray, should, be, used, instead, of, joules, per, kilogram, for, the, unit, of, absorbed, dose, d, and, the, name, sievert, instead, of, joules, per, kilogram, for, the, unit, of, dose, equivalent, h, the, accompanying, diagrams, show, how, absorbed, dose, in, grays, is, first, obtained, by, computational, techniques, and, from, this, value, the, equivalent, doses, are, derived, for, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, gray, is, numerically, the, same, value, when, expressed, in, sieverts, but, for, alpha, particles, one, gray, is, equivalent, to, 20, sieverts, and, a, radiation, weighting, factor, is, applied, accordingly, the, gray, is, conventionally, used, to, express, the, severity, of, what, are, known, as, tissue, effects, from, doses, received, in, acute, exposure, to, high, levels, of, ionizing, radiation, these, are, effects, that, are, certain, to, happen, as, opposed, to, the, uncertain, effects, of, low, levels, of, radiation, that, have, a, probability, of, causing, damage, a, whole, body, acute, exposure, to, 5, grays, or, more, of, high, energy, radiation, usually, leads, to, death, within, 14, days, ld, 1, is, 2, 5, gy, ld, 50, is, 5, gy, and, ld, 99, is, 8, gy, the, ld, 50, dose, represents, 375, joules, for, a, 75, kg, adult, the, gray, is, used, to, measure, absorbed, dose, rates, in, non, tissue, materials, for, processes, such, as, radiation, hardening, food, irradiation, and, electron, irradiation, measuring, and, controlling, the, value, of, absorbed, dose, is, vital, to, ensuring, correct, operation, of, these, processes, kerma, k, inetic, e, nergy, r, eleased, per, unit, ma, ss, is, used, in, radiation, metrology, as, a, measure, of, the, liberated, energy, of, ionisation, due, to, irradiation, and, is, expressed, in, grays, importantly, kerma, dose, is, different, from, absorbed, dose, depending, on, the, radiation, energies, involved, partially, because, ionization, energy, is, not, accounted, for, whilst, roughly, equal, at, low, energies, kerma, is, much, higher, than, absorbed, dose, at, higher, energies, because, some, energy, escapes, from, the, absorbing, volume, in, the, form, of, bremsstrahlung, x, rays, or, fast, moving, electrons, kerma, when, applied, to, air, is, equivalent, to, the, legacy, roentgen, unit, of, radiation, exposure, but, there, is, a, difference, in, the, definition, of, these, two, units, the, gray, is, defined, independently, of, any, target, material, however, the, roentgen, was, defined, specifically, by, the, ionisation, effect, in, dry, air, which, did, not, necessarily, represent, the, effect, on, other, media, wilhelm, r, ntgen, discovered, x, rays, on, november, 8, 1895, and, their, use, spread, very, quickly, for, medical, diagnostics, particularly, broken, bones, and, embedded, foreign, objects, where, they, were, a, revolutionary, improvement, over, previous, techniques, due, to, the, wide, use, of, x, rays, and, the, growing, realisation, of, the, dangers, of, ionizing, radiation, measurement, standards, became, necessary, for, radiation, intensity, and, various, countries, developed, their, own, but, using, differing, definitions, and, methods, eventually, in, order, to, promote, international, standardisation, the, first, international, congress, of, radiology, icr, meeting, in, london, in, 1925, proposed, a, separate, body, to, consider, units, of, measure, this, was, called, the, international, commission, on, radiation, units, and, measurements, or, icru, and, came, into, being, at, the, second, icr, in, stockholm, in, 1928, under, the, chairmanship, of, manne, siegbahn, one, of, the, earliest, techniques, of, measuring, the, intensity, of, x, rays, was, to, measure, their, ionising, effect, in, air, by, means, of, an, air, filled, ion, chamber, at, the, first, icru, meeting, it, was, proposed, that, one, unit, of, x, ray, dose, should, be, defined, as, the, quantity, of, x, rays, that, would, produce, one, esu, of, charge, in, one, cubic, centimetre, of, dry, air, at, 0, c, and, 1, standard, atmosphere, of, pressure, this, unit, of, radiation, exposure, was, named, the, roentgen, in, honour, of, wilhelm, r, ntgen, who, had, died, five, years, previously, at, the, 1937, meeting, of, the, icru, this, definition, was, extended, to, apply, to, gamma, radiation, this, approach, although, a, great, step, forward, in, standardisation, had, the, disadvantage, of, not, being, a, direct, measure, of, the, absorption, of, radiation, and, thereby, the, ionisation, effect, in, various, types, of, matter, including, human, tissue, and, was, a, measurement, only, of, the, effect, of, the, x, rays, in, a, specific, circumstance, the, ionisation, effect, in, dry, air, in, 1940, louis, harold, gray, who, had, been, studying, the, effect, of, neutron, damage, on, human, tissue, together, with, william, valentine, mayneord, and, the, radiobiologist, john, read, published, a, paper, in, which, a, new, unit, of, measure, dubbed, the, gram, roentgen, symbol, gr, was, proposed, and, defined, as, that, amount, of, neutron, radiation, which, produces, an, increment, in, energy, in, unit, volume, of, tissue, equal, to, the, increment, of, energy, produced, in, unit, volume, of, water, by, one, roentgen, of, radiation, this, unit, was, found, to, be, equivalent, to, 88, ergs, in, air, and, made, the, absorbed, dose, as, it, subsequently, became, known, dependent, on, the, interaction, of, the, radiation, with, the, irradiated, material, not, just, an, expression, of, radiation, exposure, or, intensity, which, the, roentgen, represented, in, 1953, the, icru, recommended, the, rad, equal, to, 100, erg, g, as, the, new, unit, of, measure, of, absorbed, radiation, the, rad, was, expressed, in, coherent, cgs, units, in, the, late, 1950s, the, cgpm, invited, the, icru, to, join, other, scientific, bodies, to, work, on, the, development, of, the, international, system, of, units, or, si, the, ccu, decided, to, define, the, si, unit, of, absorbed, radiation, as, energy, deposited, by, reabsorbed, charged, particles, per, unit, mass, of, absorbent, material, which, is, how, the, rad, had, been, defined, but, in, mks, units, it, would, be, equivalent, to, the, joule, per, kilogram, this, was, confirmed, in, 1975, by, the, 15th, cgpm, and, the, unit, was, named, the, gray, in, honour, of, louis, harold, gray, who, had, died, in, 1965, the, gray, was, thus, equal, to, 100, rad, notably, the, centigray, numerically, equivalent, to, the, rad, is, still, widely, used, to, describe, absolute, absorbed, doses, in, radiotherapy, the, adoption, of, the, gray, by, the, 15th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, as, the, unit, of, measure, of, the, absorption, of, ionizing, radiation, specific, energy, absorption, and, of, kerma, in, 1975, was, the, culmination, of, over, half, a, century, of, work, both, in, the, understanding, of, the, nature, of, ionizing, radiation, and, in, the, creation, of, coherent, radiation, quantities, and, units, the, following, table, shows, radiation, quantities, in, si, and, non, si, units
