a, thermodynamic, cycle, consists, of, linked, sequences, of, thermodynamic, processes, that, involve, transfer, of, heat, and, work, into, and, out, of, the, system, while, varying, pressure, temperature, and, other, state, variables, within, the, system, and, that, eventually, returns, the, system, to, its, initial, state, in, the, process, of, passing, through, a, cycle, the, working, fluid, system, may, convert, heat, from, a, warm, source, into, useful, work, and, dispose, of, the, remaining, heat, to, a, cold, sink, thereby, acting, as, a, heat, engine, conversely, the, cycle, may, be, reversed, and, use, work, to, move, heat, from, a, cold, source, and, transfer, it, to, a, warm, sink, thereby, acting, as, a, heat, pump, if, at, every, point, in, the, cycle, the, system, is, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, cycle, is, reversible, whether, carried, out, reversible, or, irreversibly, the, net, entropy, change, of, the, system, is, zero, as, entropy, is, a, state, function, during, a, closed, cycle, the, system, returns, to, its, original, thermodynamic, state, of, temperature, and, pressure, process, quantities, or, path, quantities, such, as, heat, and, work, are, process, dependent, for, a, cycle, for, which, the, system, returns, to, its, initial, state, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, applies, the, above, states, that, there, is, no, change, of, the, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, u, of, the, system, over, the, cycle, e, i, n, displaystyle, e, in, represents, the, total, work, and, heat, input, during, the, cycle, and, e, o, u, t, displaystyle, e, out, would, be, the, total, work, and, heat, output, during, the, cycle, the, repeating, nature, of, the, process, path, allows, for, continuous, operation, making, the, cycle, an, important, concept, in, thermodynamics, thermodynamic, cycles, are, often, represented, mathematically, as, quasistatic, processes, in, the, modeling, of, the, workings, of, an, actual, device, two, primary, classes, of, thermodynamic, cycles, are, power, cycles, and, heat, pump, cycles, power, cycles, are, cycles, which, convert, some, heat, input, into, a, mechanical, work, output, while, heat, pump, cycles, transfer, heat, from, low, to, high, temperatures, by, using, mechanical, work, as, the, input, cycles, composed, entirely, of, quasistatic, processes, can, operate, as, power, or, heat, pump, cycles, by, controlling, the, process, direction, on, a, pressure, volume, pv, diagram, or, temperature, entropy, diagram, the, clockwise, and, counterclockwise, directions, indicate, power, and, heat, pump, cycles, respectively, because, the, net, variation, in, state, properties, during, a, thermodynamic, cycle, is, zero, it, forms, a, closed, loop, on, a, pv, diagram, a, pv, diagram, s, y, axis, shows, pressure, p, and, x, axis, shows, volume, v, the, area, enclosed, by, the, loop, is, the, work, w, done, by, the, process, this, work, is, equal, to, the, balance, of, heat, q, transferred, into, the, system, equation, 2, is, consistent, with, the, first, law, even, though, the, internal, energy, changes, during, the, course, of, the, cyclic, process, when, the, cyclic, process, finishes, the, system, s, internal, energy, is, the, same, as, the, energy, it, had, when, the, process, began, if, the, cyclic, process, moves, clockwise, around, the, loop, then, w, will, be, positive, and, it, represents, a, heat, engine, if, it, moves, counterclockwise, then, w, will, be, negative, and, it, represents, a, heat, pump, the, following, processes, are, often, used, to, describe, different, stages, of, a, thermodynamic, cycle, the, otto, cycle, is, an, example, of, a, reversible, thermodynamic, cycle, thermodynamic, power, cycles, are, the, basis, for, the, operation, of, heat, engines, which, supply, most, of, the, world, s, electric, power, and, run, the, vast, majority, of, motor, vehicles, power, cycles, can, be, organized, into, two, categories, real, cycles, and, ideal, cycles, cycles, encountered, in, real, world, devices, real, cycles, are, difficult, to, analyze, because, of, the, presence, of, complicating, effects, friction, and, the, absence, of, sufficient, time, for, the, establishment, of, equilibrium, conditions, for, the, purpose, of, analysis, and, design, idealized, models, ideal, cycles, are, created, these, ideal, models, allow, engineers, to, study, the, effects, of, major, parameters, that, dominate, the, cycle, without, having, to, spend, significant, time, working, out, intricate, details, present, in, the, real, cycle, model, power, cycles, can, also, be, divided, according, to, the, type, of, heat, engine, they, seek, to, model, the, most, common, cycles, used, to, model, internal, combustion, engines, are, the, otto, cycle, which, models, gasoline, engines, and, the, diesel, cycle, which, models, diesel, engines, cycles, that, model, external, combustion, engines, include, the, brayton, cycle, which, models, gas, turbines, the, rankine, cycle, which, models, steam, turbines, the, stirling, cycle, which, models, hot, air, engines, and, the, ericsson, cycle, which, also, models, hot, air, engines, for, example, the, pressure, volume, mechanical, work, output, from, the, ideal, stirling, cycle, net, work, out, consisting, of, 4, thermodynamic, processes, is, for, the, ideal, stirling, cycle, no, volume, change, happens, in, process, 4, 1, and, 2, 3, thus, equation, 3, simplifies, to, thermodynamic, heat, pump, cycles, are, the, models, for, household, heat, pumps, and, refrigerators, there, is, no, difference, between, the, two, except, the, purpose, of, the, refrigerator, is, to, cool, a, very, small, space, while, the, household, heat, pump, is, intended, to, warm, or, cool, a, house, both, work, by, moving, heat, from, a, cold, space, to, a, warm, space, the, most, common, refrigeration, cycle, is, the, vapor, compression, cycle, which, models, systems, using, refrigerants, that, change, phase, the, absorption, refrigeration, cycle, is, an, alternative, that, absorbs, the, refrigerant, in, a, liquid, solution, rather, than, evaporating, it, gas, refrigeration, cycles, include, the, reversed, brayton, cycle, and, the, hampson, linde, cycle, multiple, compression, and, expansion, cycles, allow, gas, refrigeration, systems, to, liquify, gases, thermodynamic, cycles, may, be, used, to, model, real, devices, and, systems, typically, by, making, a, series, of, assumptions, simplifying, assumptions, are, often, necessary, to, reduce, the, problem, to, a, more, manageable, form, for, example, as, shown, in, the, figure, devices, such, a, gas, turbine, or, jet, engine, can, be, modeled, as, a, brayton, cycle, the, actual, device, is, made, up, of, a, series, of, stages, each, of, which, is, itself, modeled, as, an, idealized, thermodynamic, process, although, each, stage, which, acts, on, the, working, fluid, is, a, complex, real, device, they, may, be, modelled, as, idealized, processes, which, approximate, their, real, behavior, if, energy, is, added, by, means, other, than, combustion, then, a, further, assumption, is, that, the, exhaust, gases, would, be, passed, from, the, exhaust, to, a, heat, exchanger, that, would, sink, the, waste, heat, to, the, environment, and, the, working, gas, would, be, reused, at, the, inlet, stage, the, difference, between, an, idealized, cycle, and, actual, performance, may, be, significant, for, example, the, following, images, illustrate, the, differences, in, work, output, predicted, by, an, ideal, stirling, cycle, and, the, actual, performance, of, a, stirling, engine, as, the, net, work, output, for, a, cycle, is, represented, by, the, interior, of, the, cycle, there, is, a, significant, difference, between, the, predicted, work, output, of, the, ideal, cycle, and, the, actual, work, output, shown, by, a, real, engine, it, may, also, be, observed, that, the, real, individual, processes, diverge, from, their, idealized, counterparts, e, g, isochoric, expansion, process, 1, 2, occurs, with, some, actual, volume, change, in, practice, simple, idealized, thermodynamic, cycles, are, usually, made, out, of, four, thermodynamic, processes, any, thermodynamic, processes, may, be, used, however, when, idealized, cycles, are, modeled, often, processes, where, one, state, variable, is, kept, constant, such, as, some, example, thermodynamic, cycles, and, their, constituent, processes, are, as, follows, an, ideal, cycle, is, simple, to, analyze, and, consists, of, if, the, working, substance, is, a, perfect, gas, u, displaystyle, u, is, only, a, function, of, t, displaystyle, t, for, a, closed, system, since, its, internal, pressure, vanishes, therefore, the, internal, energy, changes, of, a, perfect, gas, undergoing, various, processes, connecting, initial, state, a, displaystyle, a, to, final, state, b, displaystyle, b, are, always, given, by, the, formula, assuming, that, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, is, constant, u, c, v, t, displaystyle, delta, u, c, v, delta, t, for, any, process, undergone, by, a, perfect, gas, under, this, set, of, assumptions, for, processes, a, and, c, we, have, w, p, v, displaystyle, w, p, delta, v, and, q, c, p, t, displaystyle, q, c, p, delta, t, whereas, for, processes, b, and, d, we, have, w, 0, displaystyle, w, 0, and, q, u, c, v, t, displaystyle, q, delta, u, c, v, delta, t, the, total, work, done, per, cycle, is, w, c, y, c, l, e, p, a, v, 2, v, 1, p, c, v, 4, v, 3, p, a, v, 2, v, 1, p, c, v, 1, v, 2, p, a, p, c, v, 2, v, 1, displaystyle, w, cycle, p, a, v, 2, v, 1, p, c, v, 4, v, 3, p, a, v, 2, v, 1, p, c, v, 1, v, 2, p, a, p, c, v, 2, v, 1, which, is, just, the, area, of, the, rectangle, if, the, total, heat, flow, per, cycle, is, required, this, is, easily, obtained, since, u, c, y, c, l, e, q, c, y, c, l, e, w, c, y, c, l, e, 0, displaystyle, delta, u, cycle, q, cycle, w, cycle, 0, we, have, q, c, y, c, l, e, w, c, y, c, l, e, displaystyle, q, cycle, w, cycle, thus, the, total, heat, flow, per, cycle, is, calculated, without, knowing, the, heat, capacities, and, temperature, changes, for, each, step, although, this, information, would, be, needed, to, assess, the, thermodynamic, efficiency, of, the, cycle, the, carnot, cycle, is, a, cycle, composed, of, the, totally, reversible, processes, of, isentropic, compression, and, expansion, and, isothermal, heat, addition, and, rejection, the, thermal, efficiency, of, a, carnot, cycle, depends, only, on, the, absolute, temperatures, of, the, two, reservoirs, in, which, heat, transfer, takes, place, and, for, a, power, cycle, is, where, t, l, displaystyle, t, l, is, the, lowest, cycle, temperature, and, t, h, displaystyle, t, h, the, highest, for, carnot, power, cycles, the, coefficient, of, performance, for, a, heat, pump, is, and, for, a, refrigerator, the, coefficient, of, performance, is, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, limits, the, efficiency, and, cop, for, all, cyclic, devices, to, levels, at, or, below, the, carnot, efficiency, the, stirling, cycle, and, ericsson, cycle, are, two, other, reversible, cycles, that, use, regeneration, to, obtain, isothermal, heat, transfer, a, stirling, cycle, is, like, an, otto, cycle, except, that, the, adiabats, are, replaced, by, isotherms, it, is, also, the, same, as, an, ericsson, cycle, with, the, isobaric, processes, substituted, for, constant, volume, processes, heat, flows, into, the, loop, through, the, top, isotherm, and, the, left, isochore, and, some, of, this, heat, flows, back, out, through, the, bottom, isotherm, and, the, right, isochore, but, most, of, the, heat, flow, is, through, the, pair, of, isotherms, this, makes, sense, since, all, the, work, done, by, the, cycle, is, done, by, the, pair, of, isothermal, processes, which, are, described, by, q, w, this, suggests, that, all, the, net, heat, comes, in, through, the, top, isotherm, in, fact, all, of, the, heat, which, comes, in, through, the, left, isochore, comes, out, through, the, right, isochore, since, the, top, isotherm, is, all, at, the, same, warmer, temperature, t, h, displaystyle, t, h, and, the, bottom, isotherm, is, all, at, the, same, cooler, temperature, t, c, displaystyle, t, c, and, since, change, in, energy, for, an, isochore, is, proportional, to, change, in, temperature, then, all, of, the, heat, coming, in, through, the, left, isochore, is, cancelled, out, exactly, by, the, heat, going, out, the, right, isochore, if, z, is, a, state, function, then, the, balance, of, z, remains, unchanged, during, a, cyclic, process, entropy, is, a, state, function, and, is, defined, in, an, absolute, sense, through, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, as, where, a, reversible, path, is, chosen, from, absolute, zero, to, the, final, state, so, that, for, an, isothermal, reversible, process, in, general, for, any, cyclic, process, the, state, points, can, be, connected, by, reversible, paths, so, that, meaning, that, the, net, entropy, change, of, the, working, fluid, over, a, cycle, is, zero
