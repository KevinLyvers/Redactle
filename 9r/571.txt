a, gemstone, also, called, a, fine, gem, jewel, precious, stone, semiprecious, stone, or, simply, gem, is, a, piece, of, mineral, crystal, which, when, cut, or, polished, is, used, to, make, jewelry, or, other, adornments, certain, rocks, such, as, lapis, lazuli, opal, and, obsidian, and, occasionally, organic, materials, that, are, not, minerals, such, as, amber, jet, and, pearl, may, also, be, used, for, jewelry, and, are, therefore, often, considered, to, be, gemstones, as, well, most, gemstones, are, hard, but, some, softer, minerals, such, as, brazilianite, may, be, used, in, jewelry, because, of, their, color, or, luster, or, other, physical, properties, that, have, aesthetic, value, however, generally, speaking, soft, minerals, are, not, typically, used, as, gemstones, by, virtue, of, their, brittleness, and, lack, of, durability, found, all, over, the, world, the, industry, of, coloured, gemstones, i, e, anything, other, than, diamonds, is, currently, estimated, at, around, us, 1, 55, billion, as, of, 2023, and, is, projected, to, steadily, increase, to, a, value, of, us, 4, 46, billion, by, 2033, a, gem, expert, is, a, gemologist, a, gem, maker, is, called, a, lapidarist, or, gemcutter, a, diamond, cutter, is, called, a, diamantaire, the, traditional, classification, in, the, west, which, goes, back, to, the, ancient, greeks, begins, with, a, distinction, between, precious, and, semi, precious, similar, distinctions, are, made, in, other, cultures, in, modern, use, the, precious, stones, are, emerald, ruby, sapphire, and, diamond, with, all, other, gemstones, being, semi, precious, this, distinction, reflects, the, rarity, of, the, respective, stones, in, ancient, times, as, well, as, their, quality, all, are, translucent, with, fine, color, in, their, purest, forms, except, for, the, colorless, diamond, and, very, hard, with, a, hardness, score, of, 8, to, 10, on, the, mohs, scale, other, stones, are, classified, by, their, color, translucency, and, hardness, the, traditional, distinction, does, not, necessarily, reflect, modern, values, for, example, while, garnets, are, relatively, inexpensive, a, green, garnet, called, tsavorite, can, be, far, more, valuable, than, a, mid, quality, emerald, another, traditional, term, for, semi, precious, gemstones, used, in, art, history, and, archaeology, is, hardstone, use, of, the, terms, precious, and, semi, precious, in, a, commercial, context, is, arguably, misleading, in, that, it, suggests, certain, stones, are, more, valuable, than, others, when, this, is, not, reflected, in, the, actual, market, value, although, it, would, generally, be, correct, if, referring, to, desirability, in, modern, times, gemstones, are, identified, by, gemologists, who, describe, gems, and, their, characteristics, using, technical, terminology, specific, to, the, field, of, gemology, the, first, characteristic, a, gemologist, uses, to, identify, a, gemstone, is, its, chemical, composition, for, example, diamonds, are, made, of, carbon, c, and, rubies, of, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, many, gems, are, crystals, which, are, classified, by, their, crystal, system, such, as, cubic, or, trigonal, or, monoclinic, another, term, used, is, habit, the, form, the, gem, is, usually, found, in, for, example, diamonds, which, have, a, cubic, crystal, system, are, often, found, as, octahedrons, gemstones, are, classified, into, different, groups, species, and, varieties, for, example, ruby, is, the, red, variety, of, the, species, corundum, while, any, other, color, of, corundum, is, considered, sapphire, other, examples, are, the, emerald, green, aquamarine, blue, red, beryl, red, goshenite, colorless, heliodor, yellow, and, morganite, pink, which, are, all, varieties, of, the, mineral, species, beryl, gems, are, characterized, in, terms, of, their, color, hue, tone, and, saturation, optical, phenomena, luster, refractive, index, birefringence, dispersion, specific, gravity, hardness, cleavage, and, fracture, they, may, exhibit, pleochroism, or, double, refraction, they, may, have, luminescence, and, a, distinctive, absorption, spectrum, gemstones, may, also, be, classified, in, terms, of, their, water, this, is, a, recognized, grading, of, the, gem, s, luster, transparency, or, brilliance, very, transparent, gems, are, considered, first, water, while, second, or, third, water, gems, are, those, of, a, lesser, transparency, additionally, material, or, flaws, within, a, stone, may, be, present, as, inclusions, gemstones, have, no, universally, accepted, grading, system, diamonds, are, graded, using, a, system, developed, by, the, gemological, institute, of, america, gia, in, the, early, 1950s, historically, all, gemstones, were, graded, using, the, naked, eye, the, gia, system, included, a, major, innovation, the, introduction, of, 10x, magnification, as, the, standard, for, grading, clarity, other, gemstones, are, still, graded, using, the, naked, eye, assuming, 20, 20, vision, a, mnemonic, device, the, four, cs, color, cut, clarity, and, carats, has, been, introduced, to, help, describe, the, factors, used, to, grade, a, diamond, with, modification, these, categories, can, be, useful, in, understanding, the, grading, of, all, gemstones, the, four, criteria, carry, different, weights, depending, upon, whether, they, are, applied, to, colored, gemstones, or, to, colorless, diamonds, in, diamonds, the, cut, is, the, primary, determinant, of, value, followed, by, clarity, and, color, an, ideally, cut, diamond, will, sparkle, to, break, down, light, into, its, constituent, rainbow, colors, dispersion, chop, it, up, into, bright, little, pieces, scintillation, and, deliver, it, to, the, eye, brilliance, in, its, rough, crystalline, form, a, diamond, will, do, none, of, these, things, it, requires, proper, fashioning, and, this, is, called, cut, in, gemstones, that, have, color, including, colored, diamonds, the, purity, and, beauty, of, that, color, is, the, primary, determinant, of, quality, physical, characteristics, that, make, a, colored, stone, valuable, are, color, clarity, to, a, lesser, extent, emeralds, will, always, have, a, number, of, inclusions, cut, unusual, optical, phenomena, within, the, stone, such, as, color, zoning, the, uneven, distribution, of, coloring, within, a, gem, and, asteria, star, effects, apart, from, the, more, generic, and, commonly, used, gemstones, such, as, from, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and, emeralds, pearls, and, opal, have, also, been, defined, as, precious, in, the, jewellery, trade, up, to, the, discoveries, of, bulk, amethyst, in, brazil, in, the, 19th, century, amethyst, was, considered, a, precious, stone, as, well, going, back, to, ancient, greece, even, in, the, last, century, certain, stones, such, as, aquamarine, peridot, and, cat, s, eye, cymophane, have, been, popular, and, hence, been, regarded, as, precious, thus, reinforcing, the, notion, that, a, mineral, s, rarity, may, have, been, implicated, in, its, classification, as, a, precious, stone, and, thus, contribute, to, its, value, today, the, gemstone, trade, no, longer, makes, such, a, distinction, many, gemstones, are, used, in, even, the, most, expensive, jewelry, depending, on, the, brand, name, of, the, designer, fashion, trends, market, supply, treatments, etc, nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and, emeralds, still, have, a, reputation, that, exceeds, those, of, other, gemstones, rare, or, unusual, gemstones, generally, understood, to, include, those, gemstones, which, occur, so, infrequently, in, gem, quality, that, they, are, scarcely, known, except, to, connoisseurs, include, andalusite, axinite, cassiterite, clinohumite, painite, and, red, beryl, gemstone, pricing, and, value, are, governed, by, factors, and, characteristics, in, the, quality, of, the, stone, these, characteristics, include, clarity, rarity, freedom, from, defects, the, beauty, of, the, stone, as, well, as, the, demand, for, such, stones, there, are, different, pricing, influencers, for, both, colored, gemstones, and, for, diamonds, the, pricing, on, colored, stones, is, determined, by, market, supply, and, demand, but, diamonds, are, more, intricate, in, the, addition, to, the, aesthetic, and, adorning, ornamental, purpose, of, gemstones, there, are, many, proponents, of, energy, medicine, who, also, value, gemstones, on, the, basis, of, their, alleged, healing, powers, a, gemstone, that, has, been, rising, in, popularity, is, cuprian, elbaite, tourmaline, which, is, also, called, paraiba, tourmaline, it, was, first, discovered, in, the, late, 1980s, in, para, ba, brazil, and, later, in, mozambique, and, nigeria, it, is, famous, for, its, glowing, neon, blue, color, paraiba, tourmaline, has, become, one, of, the, most, popular, gemstones, in, recent, times, thanks, to, its, color, and, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, important, gemstones, after, rubies, emeralds, and, sapphires, according, to, g, belin, gemlab, even, though, it, is, a, tourmaline, paraiba, tourmaline, is, one, of, the, most, expensive, gemstones, there, are, a, number, of, laboratories, which, grade, and, provide, reports, on, gemstones, each, laboratory, has, its, own, methodology, to, evaluate, gemstones, a, stone, can, be, called, pink, by, one, lab, while, another, lab, calls, it, padparadscha, one, lab, can, conclude, a, stone, is, untreated, while, another, lab, might, conclude, that, it, is, heat, treated, to, minimize, such, differences, seven, of, the, most, respected, labs, agta, gtl, new, york, cisgem, milano, gaaj, zenhokyo, tokyo, gia, carlsbad, git, bangkok, g, belin, lucerne, and, ssef, basel, have, established, the, laboratory, manual, harmonisation, committee, lmhc, for, the, standardization, of, wording, reports, promotion, of, certain, analytical, methods, and, interpretation, of, results, country, of, origin, has, sometimes, been, difficult, to, determine, due, to, the, constant, discovery, of, new, source, locations, determining, a, country, of, origin, is, thus, much, more, difficult, than, determining, other, aspects, of, a, gem, such, as, cut, clarity, etc, gem, dealers, are, aware, of, the, differences, between, gem, laboratories, and, will, make, use, of, the, discrepancies, to, obtain, the, best, possible, certificate, a, few, gemstones, are, used, as, gems, in, the, crystal, or, other, forms, in, which, they, are, found, most, however, are, cut, and, polished, for, usage, as, jewelry, the, two, main, classifications, are, as, follows, stones, which, are, opaque, or, semi, opaque, such, as, opal, turquoise, variscite, etc, are, commonly, cut, as, cabochons, these, gems, are, designed, to, show, the, stone, s, color, luster, and, other, surface, properties, as, opposed, to, internal, reflection, properties, like, brilliance, grinding, wheels, and, polishing, agents, are, used, to, grind, shape, and, polish, the, smooth, dome, shape, of, the, stones, gems, that, are, transparent, are, normally, faceted, a, method, that, shows, the, optical, properties, of, the, stone, s, interior, to, its, best, advantage, by, maximizing, reflected, light, which, is, perceived, by, the, viewer, as, sparkle, there, are, many, commonly, used, shapes, for, faceted, stones, the, facets, must, be, cut, at, the, proper, angles, which, varies, depending, on, the, optical, properties, of, the, gem, if, the, angles, are, too, steep, or, too, shallow, the, light, will, pass, through, and, not, be, reflected, back, toward, the, viewer, the, faceting, machine, is, used, to, hold, the, stone, onto, a, flat, lap, for, cutting, and, polishing, the, flat, facets, rarely, some, cutters, use, special, curved, laps, to, cut, and, polish, curved, facets, the, color, of, any, material, is, due, to, the, nature, of, light, itself, daylight, often, called, white, light, is, all, of, the, colors, of, the, spectrum, combined, when, light, strikes, a, material, most, of, the, light, is, absorbed, while, a, smaller, amount, of, a, particular, frequency, or, wavelength, is, reflected, the, part, that, is, reflected, reaches, the, eye, as, the, perceived, color, a, ruby, appears, red, because, it, absorbs, all, other, colors, of, white, light, while, reflecting, red, a, material, which, is, mostly, the, same, can, exhibit, different, colors, for, example, ruby, and, sapphire, have, the, same, primary, chemical, composition, both, are, corundum, but, exhibit, different, colors, because, of, impurities, which, absorb, and, reflect, different, wavelengths, of, light, depending, on, their, individual, compositions, even, the, same, named, gemstone, can, occur, in, many, different, colors, sapphires, show, different, shades, of, blue, and, pink, and, fancy, sapphires, exhibit, a, whole, range, of, other, colors, from, yellow, to, orange, pink, the, latter, called, padparadscha, sapphire, this, difference, in, color, is, based, on, the, atomic, structure, of, the, stone, although, the, different, stones, formally, have, the, same, chemical, composition, and, structure, they, are, not, exactly, the, same, every, now, and, then, an, atom, is, replaced, by, a, completely, different, atom, sometimes, as, few, as, one, in, a, million, atoms, these, so, called, impurities, are, sufficient, to, absorb, certain, colors, and, leave, the, other, colors, unaffected, for, example, beryl, which, is, colorless, in, its, pure, mineral, form, becomes, emerald, with, chromium, impurities, if, manganese, is, added, instead, of, chromium, beryl, becomes, pink, morganite, with, iron, it, becomes, aquamarine, some, gemstone, treatments, make, use, of, the, fact, that, these, impurities, can, be, manipulated, thus, changing, the, color, of, the, gem, gemstones, are, often, treated, to, enhance, the, color, or, clarity, of, the, stone, in, some, cases, the, treatment, applied, to, the, gemstone, can, also, increase, its, durability, even, though, natural, gemstones, can, be, transformed, using, the, traditional, method, of, cutting, and, polishing, other, treatment, options, allow, the, stone, s, appearance, to, be, enhanced, depending, on, the, type, and, extent, of, treatment, they, can, affect, the, value, of, the, stone, some, treatments, are, used, widely, because, the, resulting, gem, is, stable, while, others, are, not, accepted, most, commonly, because, the, gem, color, is, unstable, and, may, revert, to, the, original, tone, before, the, innovation, of, modern, day, tools, thousands, of, years, ago, people, were, recorded, to, use, a, variety, of, techniques, to, treat, and, enhance, gemstones, some, of, the, earliest, methods, of, gemstone, treatment, date, back, to, the, minoan, age, for, example, foiling, which, is, where, metal, foil, is, used, to, enhance, a, gemstone, s, colour, other, methods, recorded, 2000, years, ago, in, the, book, natural, history, by, pliny, the, elder, include, oiling, and, dyeing, staining, heat, can, either, improve, or, spoil, gemstone, color, or, clarity, the, heating, process, has, been, well, known, to, gem, miners, and, cutters, for, centuries, and, in, many, stone, types, heating, is, a, common, practice, most, citrine, is, made, by, heating, amethyst, and, partial, heating, with, a, strong, gradient, results, in, ametrine, a, stone, partly, amethyst, and, partly, citrine, aquamarine, is, often, heated, to, remove, yellow, tones, or, to, change, green, colors, into, the, more, desirable, blue, or, enhance, its, existing, blue, color, to, a, deeper, blue, nearly, all, tanzanite, is, heated, at, low, temperatures, to, remove, brown, undertones, and, give, a, more, desirable, blue, purple, color, a, considerable, portion, of, all, sapphire, and, ruby, is, treated, with, a, variety, of, heat, treatments, to, improve, both, color, and, clarity, when, jewelry, containing, diamonds, is, heated, for, repairs, the, diamond, should, be, protected, with, boric, acid, otherwise, the, diamond, which, is, pure, carbon, could, be, burned, on, the, surface, or, even, burned, completely, up, when, jewelry, containing, sapphires, or, rubies, is, heated, those, stones, should, not, be, coated, with, boric, acid, which, can, etch, the, surface, or, any, other, substance, they, do, not, have, to, be, protected, from, burning, like, a, diamond, although, the, stones, do, need, to, be, protected, from, heat, stress, fracture, by, immersing, the, part, of, the, jewelry, with, stones, in, the, water, when, metal, parts, are, heated, the, irradiation, process, is, widely, practiced, in, jewelry, industry, and, enabled, the, creation, of, gemstone, colors, that, do, not, exist, or, are, extremely, rare, in, nature, however, particularly, when, done, in, a, nuclear, reactor, the, processes, can, make, gemstones, radioactive, health, risks, related, to, the, residual, radioactivity, of, the, treated, gemstones, have, led, to, government, regulations, in, many, countries, virtually, all, blue, topaz, both, the, lighter, and, the, darker, blue, shades, such, as, london, blue, has, been, irradiated, to, change, the, color, from, white, to, blue, most, green, quartz, oro, verde, are, also, irradiated, to, achieve, the, yellow, green, color, diamonds, are, mainly, irradiated, to, become, blue, green, or, green, although, other, colors, are, possible, when, light, to, medium, yellow, diamonds, are, treated, with, gamma, rays, they, may, become, green, with, a, high, energy, electron, beam, blue, emeralds, containing, natural, fissures, are, sometimes, filled, with, wax, or, oil, to, disguise, them, this, wax, or, oil, is, also, colored, to, make, the, emerald, appear, of, better, color, as, well, as, clarity, turquoise, is, also, commonly, treated, in, a, similar, manner, fracture, filling, has, been, in, use, with, different, gemstones, such, as, diamonds, emeralds, and, sapphires, in, 2006, glass, filled, rubies, received, publicity, rubies, over, 10, carats, 2, g, with, large, fractures, were, filled, with, lead, glass, thus, dramatically, improving, the, appearance, of, larger, rubies, in, particular, such, treatments, are, fairly, easy, to, detect, another, treatment, method, that, is, commonly, used, to, treat, gemstones, is, bleaching, this, method, uses, a, chemical, in, order, to, reduce, the, colour, of, the, gem, after, bleaching, a, combination, treatment, can, be, done, by, dying, the, gemstone, once, the, unwanted, colours, are, removed, hydrogen, peroxide, is, the, most, commonly, used, product, used, to, alter, gemstones, and, have, notably, been, used, to, treat, jade, and, pearls, the, treatment, of, bleaching, can, also, be, followed, by, impregnation, which, allows, the, gemstone, s, durability, to, be, increased, the, socio, economic, dynamics, of, the, gemstone, industry, are, shaped, by, market, forces, and, consumer, preferences, and, typically, go, undiscussed, changes, in, demand, and, prices, can, significantly, affect, the, livelihoods, of, those, involved, in, gemstone, mining, and, trade, particularly, in, developing, countries, where, the, industry, serves, as, a, crucial, source, of, income, a, situation, that, arises, as, a, result, of, this, is, the, exploitation, of, natural, resources, and, labor, within, gemstone, mining, operations, many, mines, particularly, in, developing, countries, face, challenges, such, as, inadequate, safety, measures, low, wages, and, poor, working, conditions, miners, often, from, disadvantaged, backgrounds, endure, hazardous, working, conditions, and, receive, meager, wages, contributing, to, cycles, of, poverty, and, exploitation, gemstone, mining, operations, are, frequently, conducted, in, remote, or, underdeveloped, areas, lacking, proper, infrastructure, and, access, to, essential, services, such, as, healthcare, and, education, this, further, contributes, to, the, pre, existing, socio, economic, disparities, and, obstructs, community, development, such, that, the, benefits, of, gemstone, extraction, may, not, adequately, reach, those, directly, involved, in, the, process, another, such, issue, revolves, around, environmental, degradation, resulting, from, mining, activities, environmental, degradation, can, pose, long, term, threats, to, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, further, worsening, the, socio, economic, state, in, affected, regions, unregulated, mining, practices, often, result, in, deforestation, soil, erosion, and, water, contamination, thus, threatening, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, unregulated, mining, activity, can, also, cause, depletion, of, natural, resources, thus, diminishing, the, prospects, for, sustainable, development, the, environmental, impact, of, gemstone, mining, not, only, poses, a, threat, to, ecosystems, but, also, undermines, the, long, term, viability, of, the, industry, by, diminishing, the, quality, and, quantity, of, available, resources, furthermore, the, gemstone, industry, is, also, susceptible, to, issues, related, to, transparency, and, ethics, which, impact, both, producers, and, consumers, the, lack, of, standardized, certification, processes, and, the, prevalence, of, illicit, practices, undermine, market, integrity, and, trust, the, lack, of, transparency, and, accountability, in, the, supply, chain, aggravates, pre, existing, inequalities, as, middlemen, and, corporations, often, capture, a, disproportionate, share, of, the, profits, as, a, result, the, unequal, distribution, of, profits, along, the, supply, chain, does, little, to, improve, socio, economic, inequalities, particularly, in, regions, where, gemstones, are, mined, addressing, these, socio, economic, challenges, requires, intensive, effort, from, various, stakeholders, including, governments, industry, executives, and, society, to, promote, sustainable, practices, and, ensure, equitable, outcomes, for, all, involved, parties, implementing, and, enforcing, regulations, to, ensure, fair, labor, practices, environmental, sustainability, and, ethical, sourcing, is, essential, additionally, investing, in, community, development, projects, such, as, education, and, healthcare, initiatives, can, help, alleviate, poverty, and, empower, marginalized, communities, dependent, on, the, gemstone, industry, collaboration, across, sectors, is, crucial, for, fostering, a, more, equitable, and, sustainable, gemstone, trade, that, benefits, both, producers, and, consumers, while, respecting, human, rights, and, environmental, integrity, synthetic, gemstones, are, distinct, from, imitation, or, simulated, gems, synthetic, gems, are, physically, optically, and, chemically, identical, to, the, natural, stone, but, are, created, in, a, laboratory, imitation, or, simulated, stones, are, chemically, different, from, the, natural, stone, but, may, appear, quite, similar, to, it, they, can, be, more, easily, manufactured, synthetic, gemstones, of, a, different, mineral, spinel, glass, plastic, resins, or, other, compounds, examples, of, simulated, or, imitation, stones, include, cubic, zirconia, composed, of, zirconium, oxide, synthetic, moissanite, and, uncolored, synthetic, corundum, or, spinels, all, of, which, are, diamond, simulants, the, simulants, imitate, the, look, and, color, of, the, real, stone, but, possess, neither, their, chemical, nor, physical, characteristics, in, general, all, are, less, hard, than, diamond, moissanite, actually, has, a, higher, refractive, index, than, diamond, and, when, presented, beside, an, equivalently, sized, and, cut, diamond, will, show, more, fire, cultured, synthetic, or, lab, created, gemstones, are, not, imitations, the, bulk, mineral, and, trace, coloring, elements, are, the, same, in, both, for, example, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and, emeralds, have, been, manufactured, in, labs, that, possess, chemical, and, physical, characteristics, identical, to, the, naturally, occurring, variety, synthetic, lab, created, corundum, including, ruby, and, sapphire, is, very, common, and, costs, much, less, than, the, natural, stones, small, synthetic, diamonds, have, been, manufactured, in, large, quantities, as, industrial, abrasives, although, larger, gem, quality, synthetic, diamonds, are, becoming, available, in, multiple, carats, whether, a, gemstone, is, a, natural, stone, or, synthetic, the, chemical, physical, and, optical, characteristics, are, the, same, they, are, composed, of, the, same, mineral, and, are, colored, by, the, same, trace, materials, have, the, same, hardness, and, density, and, strength, and, show, the, same, color, spectrum, refractive, index, and, birefringence, if, any, lab, created, stones, tend, to, have, a, more, vivid, color, since, impurities, common, in, natural, stones, are, not, present, in, the, synthetic, stone, synthetics, are, made, free, of, common, naturally, occurring, impurities, that, reduce, gem, clarity, or, color, unless, intentionally, added, in, order, to, provide, a, more, drab, natural, appearance, or, to, deceive, an, assayer, on, the, other, hand, synthetics, often, show, flaws, not, seen, in, natural, stones, such, as, minute, particles, of, corroded, metal, from, lab, trays, used, during, synthesis, some, gemstones, are, more, difficult, to, synthesize, than, others, and, not, all, stones, are, commercially, viable, to, attempt, to, synthesize, these, are, the, most, common, on, the, market, currently, synthetic, corundum, includes, ruby, red, variation, and, sapphire, other, color, variations, both, of, which, are, considered, highly, desired, and, valued, ruby, was, the, first, gemstone, to, be, synthesized, by, auguste, verneuil, with, his, development, of, the, flame, fusion, process, in, 1902, synthetic, corundum, continues, to, be, made, typically, by, flame, fusion, as, it, is, most, cost, effective, but, can, also, be, produced, through, flux, growth, and, hydrothermal, growth, the, most, common, synthesized, beryl, is, emerald, green, yellow, red, and, blue, beryls, are, possible, but, much, more, rare, synthetic, emerald, became, possible, with, the, development, of, the, flux, growth, process, and, is, produced, in, this, way, and, well, as, hydrothermal, growth, types, of, synthetic, quartz, include, citrine, rose, quartz, and, amethyst, natural, occurring, quartz, is, not, rare, but, is, nevertheless, synthetically, produced, as, it, has, practical, application, outside, of, aesthetic, purposes, quartz, generates, an, electric, current, when, under, pressure, and, is, used, in, watches, clocks, and, oscillators, synthetic, spinel, was, first, produced, by, accident, it, can, be, created, in, any, color, making, it, popular, to, simulate, various, natural, gemstones, it, is, created, through, flux, growth, and, hydrothermal, growth, there, are, two, main, categories, for, creation, of, these, minerals, melt, or, solution, processes, the, flame, fusion, process, was, the, first, process, used, which, successfully, created, large, quantities, of, synthetic, gemstones, to, be, sold, on, the, market, this, remains, the, most, cost, effective, and, common, method, of, creating, corundums, today, the, flame, fusion, process, is, completed, in, a, verneuil, furnace, the, furnace, consists, of, an, inverted, blowpipe, burner, which, produces, an, extremely, hot, oxyhydrogen, flame, a, powder, dispenser, and, a, ceramic, pedestal, a, chemical, powder, which, corresponds, to, the, desired, gemstone, is, passed, through, this, flames, this, melts, the, ingredients, which, drop, on, to, a, plate, and, solidify, into, a, crystal, called, a, boule, for, corundum, the, flame, must, be, 2000, c, this, process, takes, hours, and, yields, a, crystal, with, the, same, properties, as, its, natural, counterpart, to, produce, corundum, a, pure, aluminium, powder, is, used, with, different, additives, to, achieve, different, colors, in, 1918, this, process, was, developed, by, j, czocharalski, and, is, also, referred, to, as, the, crystal, pulling, method, in, this, process, the, required, gemstone, materials, are, added, to, a, crucible, a, seed, stone, is, placed, into, the, melt, in, the, crucible, as, the, gem, begins, to, crystallize, on, the, seed, the, seed, is, pulled, away, and, the, gem, continues, to, grow, this, is, used, for, corundum, but, is, currently, the, least, popular, method, the, flux, growth, process, was, the, first, process, able, to, synthesize, emerald, flux, growth, begins, with, a, crucible, which, can, withstand, high, heat, either, graphite, or, platinum, which, is, filled, with, a, molten, liquid, referred, to, as, flux, the, specific, gem, ingredients, are, added, and, dissolved, in, this, fluid, and, recrystallize, to, form, the, desired, gemstone, this, is, a, longer, process, compared, to, the, flame, fusion, process, and, can, take, two, months, up, to, a, year, depending, on, the, desired, final, size, the, hydrothermal, growth, process, attempts, to, imitate, the, natural, growth, process, of, minerals, the, required, gem, materials, are, sealed, in, a, container, of, water, and, placed, under, extreme, pressure, the, water, is, heated, beyond, its, boiling, point, which, allows, normally, insoluble, materials, to, dissolve, as, more, material, cannot, be, added, once, the, container, is, sealed, in, order, to, create, a, larger, gem, the, process, would, begin, with, a, seed, stone, from, a, previous, batch, which, the, new, material, will, crystallize, on, this, process, takes, a, few, weeks, to, complete, synthetic, gemstones, share, chemical, and, physical, properties, with, natural, gemstones, but, there, are, some, slight, differences, that, can, be, used, to, discern, synthetic, from, natural, these, differences, are, slight, and, often, require, microscopy, as, a, tool, to, distinguish, differences, undetectable, synthetics, pose, a, threat, to, the, market, if, they, are, able, to, be, sold, as, rare, natural, gemstones, because, of, this, there, are, certain, characteristic, gemologists, look, for, each, crystal, is, characteristic, to, the, environment, and, growth, process, under, which, it, was, created, gemstones, created, from, the, flame, fusion, process, may, have, gemstones, created, from, flux, melt, process, may, have, gemstones, created, from, hydrothermal, growth, may, have, prior, to, development, of, synthesising, processes, the, alternatives, on, the, market, to, natural, gemstones, were, imitations, or, fake, in, 1837, the, first, successful, synthesis, of, ruby, occurred, french, chemist, marc, gaudin, managed, to, produce, small, crystals, of, ruby, from, melting, together, potassium, aluminium, sulphate, and, potassium, chromate, through, what, would, later, be, known, as, the, flux, melt, process, following, this, another, french, chemist, fremy, was, able, to, grow, large, quantities, of, small, ruby, crystals, using, a, lead, flux, a, few, years, later, an, alternative, to, flux, melt, was, developed, which, led, to, the, introduction, of, what, was, labeled, reconstructed, ruby, to, the, market, reconstructed, ruby, was, sold, as, a, process, which, produced, larger, rubies, from, melting, together, bits, of, natural, ruby, in, later, attempts, to, recreate, this, process, it, was, found, to, not, be, possible, and, is, believed, reconstructed, rubies, were, most, likely, created, using, a, multi, step, method, of, melting, of, ruby, powder, auguste, verneuil, a, student, of, fremy, went, on, to, develop, flame, fusion, as, an, alternative, to, the, flux, melt, method, he, developed, large, furnaces, which, were, able, to, produce, large, quantities, of, corundums, more, efficiently, and, shifted, the, gemstone, market, dramatically, this, process, is, still, used, today, and, the, furnaces, have, not, changed, much, from, the, original, design, world, production, of, corundum, using, this, method, reaches, 1000, million, carats, a, year, french, singer, songwriter, nolwenn, leroy, was, inspired, by, the, gemstones, for, her, 2017, album, gemme, meaning, gemstone, in, french, and, the, single, of, the, same, name
