europium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, eu, and, atomic, number, 63, europium, is, a, silvery, white, metal, of, the, lanthanide, series, that, reacts, readily, with, air, to, form, a, dark, oxide, coating, it, is, the, most, chemically, reactive, least, dense, and, softest, of, the, lanthanide, elements, it, is, soft, enough, to, be, cut, with, a, knife, europium, was, isolated, in, 1901, and, named, after, the, continent, of, europe, europium, usually, assumes, the, oxidation, state, 3, like, other, members, of, the, lanthanide, series, but, compounds, having, oxidation, state, 2, are, also, common, all, europium, compounds, with, oxidation, state, 2, are, slightly, reducing, europium, has, no, significant, biological, role, and, is, relatively, non, toxic, compared, to, other, heavy, metals, most, applications, of, europium, exploit, the, phosphorescence, of, europium, compounds, europium, is, one, of, the, rarest, of, the, rare, earth, elements, on, earth, its, discoverer, eug, ne, anatole, demar, ay, named, the, element, after, the, continent, of, europe, europium, is, a, ductile, metal, with, a, hardness, similar, to, that, of, lead, it, crystallizes, in, a, body, centered, cubic, lattice, some, properties, of, europium, are, strongly, influenced, by, its, half, filled, electron, shell, europium, has, the, second, lowest, melting, point, and, the, lowest, density, of, all, lanthanides, europium, is, the, most, reactive, rare, earth, element, it, rapidly, oxidizes, in, air, so, that, bulk, oxidation, of, a, centimeter, sized, sample, occurs, within, several, days, its, reactivity, with, water, is, comparable, to, that, of, calcium, and, the, reaction, is, because, of, the, high, reactivity, samples, of, solid, europium, rarely, have, the, shiny, appearance, of, the, fresh, metal, even, when, coated, with, a, protective, layer, of, mineral, oil, europium, ignites, in, air, at, 150, to, 180, c, to, form, europium, iii, oxide, europium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, pale, pink, solutions, of, 3, although, usually, trivalent, europium, readily, forms, divalent, compounds, this, behavior, is, unusual, for, most, lanthanides, which, almost, exclusively, form, compounds, with, an, oxidation, state, of, 3, the, 2, state, has, an, electron, configuration, 4, f, 7, because, the, half, filled, f, shell, provides, more, stability, in, terms, of, size, and, coordination, number, europium, ii, and, barium, ii, are, similar, the, sulfates, of, both, barium, and, europium, ii, are, also, highly, insoluble, in, water, divalent, europium, is, a, mild, reducing, agent, oxidizing, in, air, to, form, eu, iii, compounds, in, anaerobic, and, particularly, geothermal, conditions, the, divalent, form, is, sufficiently, stable, that, it, tends, to, be, incorporated, into, minerals, of, calcium, and, the, other, alkaline, earths, this, ion, exchange, process, is, the, basis, of, the, negative, europium, anomaly, the, low, europium, content, in, many, lanthanide, minerals, such, as, monazite, relative, to, the, chondritic, abundance, bastn, site, tends, to, show, less, of, a, negative, europium, anomaly, than, does, monazite, and, hence, is, the, major, source, of, europium, today, the, development, of, easy, methods, to, separate, divalent, europium, from, the, other, trivalent, lanthanides, made, europium, accessible, even, when, present, in, low, concentration, as, it, usually, is, naturally, occurring, europium, is, composed, of, two, isotopes, 151, eu, and, 153, eu, which, occur, in, almost, equal, proportions, 153, eu, is, slightly, more, abundant, 52, 2, natural, abundance, while, 153, eu, is, stable, 151, eu, was, found, to, be, unstable, to, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 5, 11, 3, 10, 18, years, in, 2007, giving, about, one, alpha, decay, per, two, minutes, in, every, kilogram, of, natural, europium, this, value, is, in, reasonable, agreement, with, theoretical, predictions, besides, the, natural, radioisotope, 151, eu, 35, artificial, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, being, 150, eu, with, a, half, life, of, 36, 9, years, 152, eu, with, a, half, life, of, 13, 516, years, and, 154, eu, with, a, half, life, of, 8, 593, years, all, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, shorter, than, 4, 7612, years, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, shorter, than, 12, 2, seconds, the, known, isotopes, of, europium, range, from, 130, eu, to, 170, eu, this, element, also, has, 17, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 150m, eu, t, 1, 2, 12, 8, hours, 152m1, eu, t, 1, 2, 9, 3116, hours, and, 152m2, eu, t, 1, 2, 96, minutes, the, primary, decay, mode, for, isotopes, lighter, than, 153, eu, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, for, heavier, isotopes, is, beta, minus, decay, the, primary, decay, products, before, 153, eu, are, isotopes, of, samarium, sm, and, the, primary, products, after, are, isotopes, of, gadolinium, gd, europium, is, produced, by, nuclear, fission, 155, eu, half, life, 4, 7612, years, has, a, fission, yield, of, 330, parts, per, million, ppm, for, uranium, 235, and, thermal, neutrons, the, fission, product, yields, of, europium, isotopes, are, low, near, the, top, of, the, mass, range, for, fission, products, as, with, other, lanthanides, many, isotopes, of, europium, especially, those, that, have, odd, mass, numbers, or, are, neutron, poor, like, 152, eu, have, high, cross, sections, for, neutron, capture, often, high, enough, to, be, neutron, poisons, 151, eu, is, the, beta, decay, product, of, samarium, 151, but, since, this, has, a, long, decay, half, life, and, short, mean, time, to, neutron, absorption, most, 151, sm, instead, ends, up, as, 152, sm, 152, eu, half, life, 13, 516, years, and, 154, eu, half, life, 8, 593, years, cannot, be, beta, decay, products, because, 152, sm, and, 154, sm, are, non, radioactive, but, 154, eu, is, the, only, long, lived, shielded, nuclide, other, than, 134, cs, to, have, a, fission, yield, of, more, than, 2, 5, parts, per, million, fissions, a, larger, amount, of, 154, eu, is, produced, by, neutron, activation, of, a, significant, portion, of, the, non, radioactive, 153, eu, however, much, of, this, is, further, converted, to, 155, eu, europium, is, not, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, many, minerals, contain, europium, with, the, most, important, sources, being, bastn, site, monazite, xenotime, and, loparite, ce, no, europium, dominant, minerals, are, known, yet, despite, a, single, find, of, a, tiny, possible, eu, o, or, eu, o, c, system, phase, in, the, moon, s, regolith, depletion, or, enrichment, of, europium, in, minerals, relative, to, other, rare, earth, elements, is, known, as, the, europium, anomaly, europium, is, commonly, included, in, trace, element, studies, in, geochemistry, and, petrology, to, understand, the, processes, that, form, igneous, rocks, rocks, that, cooled, from, magma, or, lava, the, nature, of, the, europium, anomaly, found, helps, reconstruct, the, relationships, within, a, suite, of, igneous, rocks, the, median, crustal, abundance, of, europium, is, 2, ppm, values, of, the, less, abundant, elements, may, vary, with, location, by, several, orders, of, magnitude, divalent, europium, eu, 2, in, small, amounts, is, the, activator, of, the, bright, blue, fluorescence, of, some, samples, of, the, mineral, fluorite, caf, 2, the, reduction, from, eu, 3, to, eu, 2, is, induced, by, irradiation, with, energetic, particles, the, most, outstanding, examples, of, this, originated, around, weardale, and, adjacent, parts, of, northern, england, it, was, the, fluorite, found, here, that, fluorescence, was, named, after, in, 1852, although, it, was, not, until, much, later, that, europium, was, determined, to, be, the, cause, in, astrophysics, the, signature, of, europium, in, stellar, spectra, can, be, used, to, classify, stars, and, inform, theories, of, how, or, where, a, particular, star, was, born, for, instance, astronomers, in, 2019, identified, higher, than, expected, levels, of, europium, within, the, star, j1124, 4535, hypothesizing, that, this, star, originated, in, a, dwarf, galaxy, that, collided, with, the, milky, way, billions, of, years, ago, europium, is, associated, with, the, other, rare, earth, elements, and, is, therefore, mined, together, with, them, separation, of, the, rare, earth, elements, occurs, during, later, processing, rare, earth, elements, are, found, in, the, minerals, bastn, site, loparite, ce, xenotime, and, monazite, in, mineable, quantities, bastn, site, is, a, group, of, related, fluorocarbonates, ln, co, 3, f, oh, monazite, is, a, group, of, related, of, orthophosphate, minerals, lnpo, 4, ln, denotes, a, mixture, of, all, the, lanthanides, except, promethium, loparite, ce, is, an, oxide, and, xenotime, is, an, orthophosphate, y, yb, er, po, 4, monazite, also, contains, thorium, and, yttrium, which, complicates, handling, because, thorium, and, its, decay, products, are, radioactive, for, the, extraction, from, the, ore, and, the, isolation, of, individual, lanthanides, several, methods, have, been, developed, the, choice, of, method, is, based, on, the, concentration, and, composition, of, the, ore, and, on, the, distribution, of, the, individual, lanthanides, in, the, resulting, concentrate, roasting, the, ore, followed, by, acidic, and, basic, leaching, is, used, mostly, to, produce, a, concentrate, of, lanthanides, if, cerium, is, the, dominant, lanthanide, then, it, is, converted, from, cerium, iii, to, cerium, iv, and, then, precipitated, further, separation, by, solvent, extractions, or, ion, exchange, chromatography, yields, a, fraction, which, is, enriched, in, europium, this, fraction, is, reduced, with, zinc, zinc, amalgam, electrolysis, or, other, methods, converting, the, europium, iii, to, europium, ii, europium, ii, reacts, in, a, way, similar, to, that, of, alkaline, earth, metals, and, therefore, it, can, be, precipitated, as, a, carbonate, or, co, precipitated, with, barium, sulfate, europium, metal, is, available, through, the, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, of, molten, eucl, 3, and, nacl, or, cacl, 2, in, a, graphite, cell, which, serves, as, cathode, using, graphite, as, anode, the, other, product, is, chlorine, gas, a, few, large, deposits, produce, or, produced, a, significant, amount, of, the, world, production, the, bayan, obo, iron, ore, deposit, in, inner, mongolia, contains, significant, amounts, of, bastn, site, and, monazite, and, is, with, an, estimated, 36, million, tonnes, of, rare, earth, element, oxides, the, largest, known, deposit, the, mining, operations, at, the, bayan, obo, deposit, made, china, the, largest, supplier, of, rare, earth, elements, in, the, 1990s, only, 0, 2, of, the, rare, earth, element, content, is, europium, the, second, large, source, for, rare, earth, elements, between, 1965, and, its, closure, in, the, late, 1990s, was, the, mountain, pass, rare, earth, mine, in, california, the, bastn, site, mined, there, is, especially, rich, in, the, light, rare, earth, elements, la, gd, sc, and, y, and, contains, only, 0, 1, of, europium, another, large, source, for, rare, earth, elements, is, the, loparite, found, on, the, kola, peninsula, it, contains, besides, niobium, tantalum, and, titanium, up, to, 30, rare, earth, elements, and, is, the, largest, source, for, these, elements, in, russia, europium, compounds, tend, to, exist, in, a, trivalent, oxidation, state, under, most, conditions, commonly, these, compounds, feature, eu, iii, bound, by, 6, 9, oxygenic, ligands, the, eu, iii, sulfates, nitrates, and, chlorides, are, soluble, in, water, or, polar, organic, solvents, lipophilic, europium, complexes, often, feature, acetylacetonate, like, ligands, such, as, eufod, europium, metal, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, this, route, gives, white, europium, iii, fluoride, euf, 3, yellow, europium, iii, chloride, eucl, 3, gray, europium, iii, bromide, eubr, 3, and, colorless, europium, iii, iodide, eui, 3, europium, also, forms, the, corresponding, dihalides, yellow, green, europium, ii, fluoride, euf, 2, colorless, europium, ii, chloride, eucl, 2, although, it, has, a, bright, blue, fluorescence, under, uv, light, colorless, europium, ii, bromide, eubr, 2, and, green, europium, ii, iodide, eui, 2, europium, forms, stable, compounds, with, all, of, the, chalcogens, but, the, heavier, chalcogens, s, se, and, te, stabilize, the, lower, oxidation, state, three, oxides, are, known, europium, ii, oxide, euo, europium, iii, oxide, eu, 2, o, 3, and, the, mixed, valence, oxide, eu, 3, o, 4, consisting, of, both, eu, ii, and, eu, iii, otherwise, the, main, chalcogenides, are, europium, ii, sulfide, eus, europium, ii, selenide, euse, and, europium, ii, telluride, eute, all, three, of, these, are, black, solids, europium, ii, sulfide, is, prepared, by, sulfiding, the, oxide, at, temperatures, sufficiently, high, to, decompose, the, eu, 2, o, 3, the, main, nitride, of, europium, is, europium, iii, nitride, eun, although, europium, is, present, in, most, of, the, minerals, containing, the, other, rare, elements, due, to, the, difficulties, in, separating, the, elements, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1800s, that, the, element, was, isolated, william, crookes, observed, the, phosphorescent, spectra, of, the, rare, elements, including, those, eventually, assigned, to, europium, europium, was, first, found, in, 1892, by, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, who, obtained, basic, fractions, from, samarium, gadolinium, concentrates, which, had, spectral, lines, not, accounted, for, by, samarium, or, gadolinium, however, the, discovery, of, europium, is, generally, credited, to, french, chemist, eug, ne, anatole, demar, ay, who, suspected, samples, of, the, recently, discovered, element, samarium, were, contaminated, with, an, unknown, element, in, 1896, and, who, was, able, to, isolate, it, in, 1901, he, then, named, it, europium, when, the, europium, doped, yttrium, orthovanadate, red, phosphor, was, discovered, in, the, early, 1960s, and, understood, to, be, about, to, cause, a, revolution, in, the, color, television, industry, there, was, a, scramble, for, the, limited, supply, of, europium, on, hand, among, the, monazite, processors, as, the, typical, europium, content, in, monazite, is, about, 0, 05, however, the, molycorp, bastn, site, deposit, at, the, mountain, pass, rare, earth, mine, california, whose, lanthanides, had, an, unusually, high, europium, content, of, 0, 1, was, about, to, come, on, line, and, provide, sufficient, europium, to, sustain, the, industry, prior, to, europium, the, color, tv, red, phosphor, was, very, weak, and, the, other, phosphor, colors, had, to, be, muted, to, maintain, color, balance, with, the, brilliant, red, europium, phosphor, it, was, no, longer, necessary, to, mute, the, other, colors, and, a, much, brighter, color, tv, picture, was, the, result, europium, has, continued, to, be, in, use, in, the, tv, industry, ever, since, as, well, as, in, computer, monitors, californian, bastn, site, now, faces, stiff, competition, from, bayan, obo, china, with, an, even, richer, europium, content, of, 0, 2, frank, spedding, celebrated, for, his, development, of, the, ion, exchange, technology, that, revolutionized, the, rare, earth, industry, in, the, mid, 1950s, once, related, the, story, of, how, he, was, lecturing, on, the, rare, earths, in, the, 1930s, when, an, elderly, gentleman, approached, him, with, an, offer, of, a, gift, of, several, pounds, of, europium, oxide, this, was, an, unheard, of, quantity, at, the, time, and, spedding, did, not, take, the, man, seriously, however, a, package, duly, arrived, in, the, mail, containing, several, pounds, of, genuine, europium, oxide, the, elderly, gentleman, had, turned, out, to, be, herbert, newby, mccoy, who, had, developed, a, famous, method, of, europium, purification, involving, redox, chemistry, relative, to, most, other, elements, commercial, applications, for, europium, are, few, and, rather, specialized, almost, invariably, its, phosphorescence, is, exploited, either, in, the, 2, or, 3, oxidation, state, it, is, a, dopant, in, some, types, of, glass, in, lasers, and, other, optoelectronic, devices, europium, oxide, eu, 2, o, 3, is, widely, used, as, a, red, phosphor, in, television, sets, and, fluorescent, lamps, and, as, an, activator, for, yttrium, based, phosphors, color, tv, screens, contain, between, 0, 5, and, 1, g, of, europium, oxide, whereas, trivalent, europium, gives, red, phosphors, the, luminescence, of, divalent, europium, depends, strongly, on, the, composition, of, the, host, structure, uv, to, deep, red, luminescence, can, be, achieved, the, two, classes, of, europium, based, phosphor, red, and, blue, combined, with, the, yellow, green, terbium, phosphors, give, white, light, the, color, temperature, of, which, can, be, varied, by, altering, the, proportion, or, specific, composition, of, the, individual, phosphors, this, phosphor, system, is, typically, encountered, in, helical, fluorescent, light, bulbs, combining, the, same, three, classes, is, one, way, to, make, trichromatic, systems, in, tv, and, computer, screens, but, as, an, additive, it, can, be, particularly, effective, in, improving, the, intensity, of, red, phosphor, europium, is, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, fluorescent, glass, increasing, the, general, efficiency, of, fluorescent, lamps, one, of, the, more, common, persistent, after, glow, phosphors, besides, copper, doped, zinc, sulfide, is, europium, doped, strontium, aluminate, europium, fluorescence, is, used, to, interrogate, biomolecular, interactions, in, drug, discovery, screens, it, is, also, used, in, the, anti, counterfeiting, phosphors, in, euro, banknotes, an, application, that, has, almost, fallen, out, of, use, with, the, introduction, of, affordable, superconducting, magnets, is, the, use, of, europium, complexes, such, as, eu, fod, 3, as, shift, reagents, in, nmr, spectroscopy, chiral, shift, reagents, such, as, eu, hfc, 3, are, still, used, to, determine, enantiomeric, purity, europium, compounds, are, used, to, label, antibodies, for, sensitive, detection, of, antigens, in, body, fluids, a, form, of, immunoassay, when, these, europium, labeled, antibodies, bind, to, specific, antigens, the, resulting, complex, can, be, detected, with, laser, excited, florescence, there, are, no, clear, indications, that, europium, is, particularly, toxic, compared, to, other, heavy, metals, europium, chloride, nitrate, and, oxide, have, been, tested, for, toxicity, europium, chloride, shows, an, acute, intraperitoneal, ld, 50, toxicity, of, 550, mg, kg, and, the, acute, oral, ld, 50, toxicity, is, 5000, mg, kg, europium, nitrate, shows, a, slightly, higher, intraperitoneal, ld, 50, toxicity, of, 320, mg, kg, while, the, oral, toxicity, is, above, 5000, mg, kg, the, metal, dust, presents, a, fire, and, explosion, hazard
