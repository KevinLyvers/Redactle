acid, rain, is, rain, or, any, other, form, of, precipitation, that, is, unusually, acidic, meaning, that, it, has, elevated, levels, of, hydrogen, ions, low, ph, most, water, including, drinking, water, has, a, neutral, ph, that, exists, between, 6, 5, and, 8, 5, but, acid, rain, has, a, ph, level, lower, than, this, and, ranges, from, 4, 5, on, average, the, more, acidic, the, acid, rain, is, the, lower, its, ph, is, acid, rain, can, have, harmful, effects, on, plants, aquatic, animals, and, infrastructure, acid, rain, is, caused, by, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, which, react, with, the, water, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, to, produce, acids, acid, rain, has, been, shown, to, have, adverse, impacts, on, forests, freshwaters, soils, microbes, insects, and, aquatic, life, forms, in, ecosystems, persistent, acid, rain, reduces, tree, bark, durability, leaving, flora, more, susceptible, to, environmental, stressors, such, as, drought, heat, cold, and, pest, infestation, acid, rain, is, also, capable, of, detrimenting, soil, composition, by, stripping, it, of, nutrients, such, as, calcium, and, magnesium, which, play, a, role, in, plant, growth, and, maintaining, healthy, soil, in, terms, of, human, infrastructure, acid, rain, also, causes, paint, to, peel, corrosion, of, steel, structures, such, as, bridges, and, weathering, of, stone, buildings, and, statues, as, well, as, having, impacts, on, human, health, some, governments, including, those, in, europe, and, north, america, have, made, efforts, since, the, 1970s, to, reduce, the, release, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, into, the, atmosphere, through, air, pollution, regulations, these, efforts, have, had, positive, results, due, to, the, widespread, research, on, acid, rain, starting, in, the, 1960s, and, the, publicized, information, on, its, harmful, effects, the, main, source, of, sulfur, and, nitrogen, compounds, that, result, in, acid, rain, are, anthropogenic, but, nitrogen, oxides, can, also, be, produced, naturally, by, lightning, strikes, and, sulfur, dioxide, is, produced, by, volcanic, eruptions, acid, rain, is, rain, with, a, ph, less, than, 5, clean, or, unpolluted, rain, has, a, ph, greater, than, 5, but, still, less, than, ph, 7, owing, to, the, acidity, caused, by, carbon, dioxide, acid, according, to, the, following, reactions, a, variety, of, natural, and, human, made, sources, contribute, to, the, acidity, for, example, nitric, acid, produced, by, electric, discharge, in, the, atmosphere, such, as, lightning, the, usual, anthropogenic, sources, are, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, they, react, with, water, as, does, carbon, dioxide, to, give, solutions, with, ph, 5, occasional, ph, readings, in, rain, and, fog, water, of, well, below, 2, 4, have, been, reported, in, industrialized, areas, acid, rain, was, first, systematically, studied, in, europe, in, the, 1960s, and, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, following, decade, the, corrosive, effect, of, polluted, acidic, city, air, on, limestone, and, marble, was, noted, in, the, 17th, century, by, john, evelyn, who, remarked, upon, the, poor, condition, of, the, arundel, marbles, since, the, industrial, revolution, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxides, into, the, atmosphere, have, increased, in, 1852, robert, angus, smith, was, the, first, to, show, the, relationship, between, acid, rain, and, atmospheric, pollution, in, manchester, england, smith, coined, the, term, acid, rain, in, 1872, in, the, late, 1960s, scientists, began, widely, observing, and, studying, the, phenomenon, at, first, the, main, focus, in, this, research, lay, on, local, effects, of, acid, rain, waldemar, christofer, br, gger, was, the, first, to, acknowledge, long, distance, transportation, of, pollutants, crossing, borders, from, the, united, kingdom, to, norway, a, problem, systematically, studied, by, brynjulf, ottar, in, the, 1970s, ottar, s, work, was, strongly, influenced, by, swedish, soil, scientist, svante, od, n, who, had, drawn, widespread, attention, to, europe, s, acid, rain, problem, in, popular, newspapers, and, wrote, a, landmark, paper, on, the, subject, in, 1968, the, earliest, report, about, acid, rain, in, the, united, states, came, from, chemical, evidence, gathered, from, hubbard, brook, valley, public, awareness, of, acid, rain, in, the, us, increased, in, the, 1970s, after, the, new, york, times, reported, on, these, findings, in, 1972, a, group, of, scientists, including, gene, likens, discovered, the, rain, that, was, deposited, at, white, mountains, of, new, hampshire, was, acidic, the, ph, of, the, sample, was, measured, to, be, 4, 03, at, hubbard, brook, the, hubbard, brook, ecosystem, study, followed, up, with, a, series, of, research, studies, that, analyzed, the, environmental, effects, of, acid, rain, the, alumina, from, soils, neutralized, acid, rain, that, mixed, with, stream, water, at, hubbard, brook, the, result, of, this, research, indicated, that, the, chemical, reaction, between, acid, rain, and, aluminium, leads, to, an, increasing, rate, of, soil, weathering, experimental, research, examined, the, effects, of, increased, acidity, in, streams, on, ecological, species, in, 1980, scientists, modified, the, acidity, of, norris, brook, new, hampshire, and, observed, the, change, in, species, behaviors, there, was, a, decrease, in, species, diversity, an, increase, in, community, dominants, and, a, reduction, in, the, food, web, complexity, in, 1980, the, us, congress, passed, an, acid, deposition, act, this, act, established, an, 18, year, assessment, and, research, program, under, the, direction, of, the, national, acidic, precipitation, assessment, program, napap, napap, enlarged, a, network, of, monitoring, sites, to, determine, how, acidic, precipitation, was, seeking, to, determine, long, term, trends, and, established, a, network, for, dry, deposition, using, a, statistically, based, sampling, design, napap, quantified, the, effects, of, acid, rain, on, a, regional, basis, by, targeting, research, and, surveys, to, identify, and, quantify, the, impact, of, acid, precipitation, on, freshwater, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, napap, also, assessed, the, effects, of, acid, rain, on, historical, buildings, monuments, and, building, materials, it, also, funded, extensive, studies, on, atmospheric, processes, and, potential, control, programs, from, the, start, policy, advocates, from, all, sides, attempted, to, influence, napap, activities, to, support, their, particular, policy, advocacy, efforts, or, to, disparage, those, of, their, opponents, for, the, us, government, s, scientific, enterprise, a, significant, impact, of, napap, were, lessons, learned, in, the, assessment, process, and, in, environmental, research, management, to, a, relatively, large, group, of, scientists, program, managers, and, the, public, in, 1981, the, national, academy, of, sciences, was, looking, into, research, about, the, controversial, issues, regarding, acid, rain, president, ronald, reagan, dismissed, the, issues, of, acid, rain, until, his, personal, visit, to, canada, and, confirmed, that, the, canadian, border, suffered, from, the, drifting, pollution, from, smokestacks, originating, in, the, us, midwest, reagan, honored, the, agreement, to, canadian, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, s, enforcement, of, anti, pollution, regulation, in, 1982, reagan, commissioned, william, nierenberg, to, serve, on, the, national, science, board, nierenberg, selected, scientists, including, gene, likens, to, serve, on, a, panel, to, draft, a, report, on, acid, rain, in, 1983, the, panel, of, scientists, came, up, with, a, draft, report, which, concluded, that, acid, rain, is, a, real, problem, and, solutions, should, be, sought, white, house, office, of, science, and, technology, policy, reviewed, the, draft, report, and, sent, fred, singer, s, suggestions, of, the, report, which, cast, doubt, on, the, cause, of, acid, rain, the, panelists, revealed, rejections, against, singer, s, positions, and, submitted, the, report, to, nierenberg, in, april, in, may, 1983, the, house, of, representatives, voted, against, legislation, that, aimed, to, control, sulfur, emissions, there, was, a, debate, about, whether, nierenberg, delayed, to, release, the, report, nierenberg, himself, denied, the, saying, about, his, suppression, of, the, report, and, stated, that, the, report, was, withheld, after, the, house, s, vote, because, it, was, not, ready, to, be, published, in, 1991, the, us, national, acid, precipitation, assessment, program, napap, provided, its, first, assessment, of, acid, rain, in, the, united, states, it, reported, that, 5, of, new, england, lakes, were, acidic, with, sulfates, being, the, most, common, problem, they, noted, that, 2, of, the, lakes, could, no, longer, support, brook, trout, and, 6, of, the, lakes, were, unsuitable, for, the, survival, of, many, species, of, minnow, subsequent, reports, to, congress, have, documented, chemical, changes, in, soil, and, freshwater, ecosystems, nitrogen, saturation, decreases, in, amounts, of, nutrients, in, soil, episodic, acidification, regional, haze, and, damage, to, historical, monuments, meanwhile, in, 1990, the, us, congress, passed, a, series, of, amendments, to, the, clean, air, act, title, iv, of, these, amendments, established, a, cap, and, trade, system, designed, to, control, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxides, both, these, emissions, proved, to, cause, a, significant, problem, on, u, s, citizens, and, their, access, to, healthy, clean, air, title, iv, called, for, a, total, reduction, of, about, 10, million, tons, of, so, 2, emissions, from, power, plants, close, to, a, 50, reduction, it, was, implemented, in, two, phases, phase, i, began, in, 1995, and, limited, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, from, 110, of, the, largest, power, plants, to, a, combined, total, of, 8, 7, million, tons, of, sulfur, dioxide, one, power, plant, in, new, england, merrimack, was, in, phase, i, four, other, plants, newington, mount, tom, brayton, point, and, salem, harbor, were, added, under, other, provisions, of, the, program, phase, ii, began, in, 2000, and, affects, most, of, the, power, plants, in, the, country, during, the, 1990s, research, continued, on, march, 10, 2005, the, epa, issued, the, clean, air, interstate, rule, cair, this, rule, provides, states, with, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, power, plant, pollution, that, drifts, from, one, state, to, another, cair, will, permanently, cap, emissions, of, so, 2, and, no, x, in, the, eastern, united, states, when, fully, implemented, cair, will, reduce, so, 2, emissions, in, 28, eastern, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, by, over, 70, and, no, x, emissions, by, over, 60, from, 2003, levels, overall, the, program, s, cap, and, trade, program, has, been, successful, in, achieving, its, goals, since, the, 1990s, so, 2, emissions, have, dropped, 40, and, according, to, the, pacific, research, institute, acid, rain, levels, have, dropped, 65, since, 1976, conventional, regulation, was, used, in, the, european, union, which, saw, a, decrease, of, over, 70, in, so, 2, emissions, during, the, same, time, period, in, 2007, total, so, 2, emissions, were, 8, 9, million, tons, achieving, the, program, s, long, term, goal, ahead, of, the, 2010, statutory, deadline, in, 2007, the, epa, estimated, that, by, 2010, the, overall, costs, of, complying, with, the, program, for, businesses, and, consumers, would, be, 1, billion, to, 2, billion, a, year, only, one, fourth, of, what, was, originally, predicted, forbes, says, in, 2010, by, which, time, the, cap, and, trade, system, had, been, augmented, by, the, george, w, bush, administration, s, clean, air, interstate, rule, so, 2, emissions, had, fallen, to, 5, 1, million, tons, the, term, citizen, science, can, be, traced, back, as, far, as, january, 1989, to, a, campaign, by, the, audubon, society, to, measure, acid, rain, scientist, muki, haklay, cites, in, a, policy, report, for, the, wilson, center, entitled, citizen, science, and, policy, a, european, perspective, a, first, use, of, the, term, citizen, science, by, r, kerson, in, the, magazine, mit, technology, review, from, january, 1989, quoting, from, the, wilson, center, report, the, new, form, of, engagement, in, science, received, the, name, citizen, science, the, first, recorded, example, of, the, use, of, the, term, is, from, 1989, describing, how, 225, volunteers, across, the, us, collected, rain, samples, to, assist, the, audubon, society, in, an, acid, rain, awareness, raising, campaign, the, volunteers, collected, samples, checked, for, acidity, and, reported, back, to, the, organization, the, information, was, then, used, to, demonstrate, the, full, extent, of, the, phenomenon, canadian, harold, harvey, was, among, the, first, to, research, a, dead, lake, in, 1971, he, and, r, j, beamish, published, a, report, acidification, of, the, la, cloche, mountain, lakes, documenting, the, gradual, deterioration, of, fish, stocks, in, 60, lakes, in, killarney, park, in, ontario, which, they, had, been, studying, systematically, since, 1966, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, acid, rain, was, a, major, topic, of, research, at, the, experimental, lakes, area, ela, in, northwestern, ontario, canada, researchers, added, sulfuric, acid, to, whole, lakes, in, controlled, ecosystem, experiments, to, simulate, the, effects, of, acid, rain, because, its, remote, conditions, allowed, for, whole, ecosystem, experiments, research, at, the, ela, showed, that, the, effect, of, acid, rain, on, fish, populations, started, at, concentrations, much, lower, than, those, observed, in, laboratory, experiments, in, the, context, of, a, food, web, fish, populations, crashed, earlier, than, when, acid, rain, had, direct, toxic, effects, to, the, fish, because, the, acidity, led, to, crashes, in, prey, populations, e, g, mysids, as, experimental, acid, inputs, were, reduced, fish, populations, and, lake, ecosystems, recovered, at, least, partially, although, invertebrate, populations, have, still, not, completely, returned, to, the, baseline, conditions, this, research, showed, both, that, acidification, was, linked, to, declining, fish, populations, and, that, the, effects, could, be, reversed, if, sulfuric, acid, emissions, decreased, and, influenced, policy, in, canada, and, the, united, states, in, 1985, seven, canadian, provinces, all, except, british, columbia, alberta, and, saskatchewan, and, the, federal, government, signed, the, eastern, canada, acid, rain, program, the, provinces, agreed, to, limit, their, combined, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, to, 2, 3, million, tonnes, by, 1994, the, canada, us, air, quality, agreement, was, signed, in, 1991, in, 1998, all, federal, provincial, and, territorial, ministers, of, energy, and, environment, signed, the, canada, wide, acid, rain, strategy, for, post, 2000, which, was, designed, to, protect, lakes, that, are, more, sensitive, than, those, protected, by, earlier, policies, increased, risk, might, be, posed, by, the, expected, rise, in, total, sulphur, emissions, from, 4, 400, kilotonnes, kt, in, 1990, to, 6, 500, kt, in, 2000, 10, 900, kt, in, 2010, and, 18, 500, in, 2020, the, most, important, gas, which, leads, to, acidification, is, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, of, nitrogen, oxides, which, are, oxidized, to, form, nitric, acid, are, of, increasing, importance, due, to, stricter, controls, on, emissions, of, sulfur, compounds, 70, tg, s, per, year, in, the, form, of, so, 2, comes, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, and, industry, 2, 8, tg, s, from, wildfires, and, 7, 8, tg, s, per, year, from, volcanoes, the, principal, natural, phenomena, that, contribute, acid, producing, gases, to, the, atmosphere, are, emissions, from, volcanoes, thus, for, example, fumaroles, from, the, laguna, caliente, crater, of, po, s, volcano, create, extremely, high, amounts, of, acid, rain, and, fog, with, acidity, as, high, as, a, ph, of, 2, clearing, an, area, of, any, vegetation, and, frequently, causing, irritation, to, the, eyes, and, lungs, of, inhabitants, in, nearby, settlements, acid, producing, gasses, are, also, created, by, biological, processes, that, occur, on, the, land, in, wetlands, and, in, the, oceans, the, major, biological, source, of, sulfur, compounds, is, dimethyl, sulfide, nitric, acid, in, rainwater, is, an, important, source, of, fixed, nitrogen, for, plant, life, and, is, also, produced, by, electrical, activity, in, the, atmosphere, such, as, lightning, acidic, deposits, have, been, detected, in, glacial, ice, thousands, of, years, old, in, remote, parts, of, the, globe, the, principal, cause, of, acid, rain, is, sulfur, and, nitrogen, compounds, from, human, sources, such, as, electricity, generation, animal, agriculture, factories, and, motor, vehicles, these, also, include, power, plants, which, use, electric, power, generators, that, account, for, a, quarter, of, nitrogen, oxides, and, two, thirds, of, sulfur, dioxide, within, the, atmosphere, industrial, acid, rain, is, a, substantial, problem, in, china, and, russia, and, areas, downwind, from, them, these, areas, all, burn, sulfur, containing, coal, to, generate, heat, and, electricity, the, problem, of, acid, rain, has, not, only, increased, with, population, and, industrial, growth, but, has, become, more, widespread, the, use, of, tall, smokestacks, to, reduce, local, pollution, has, contributed, to, the, spread, of, acid, rain, by, releasing, gases, into, regional, atmospheric, circulation, dispersal, from, these, taller, stacks, causes, pollutants, to, be, carried, farther, causing, widespread, ecological, damage, often, deposition, occurs, a, considerable, distance, downwind, of, the, emissions, with, mountainous, regions, tending, to, receive, the, greatest, deposition, because, of, their, higher, rainfall, an, example, of, this, effect, is, the, low, ph, of, rain, which, falls, in, scandinavia, regarding, low, ph, and, ph, imbalances, in, correlation, to, acid, rain, low, levels, or, those, under, the, ph, value, of, 7, are, considered, acidic, acid, rain, falls, at, a, ph, value, of, roughly, 4, making, it, harmful, to, consume, for, humans, when, these, low, ph, levels, fall, in, specific, regions, they, not, only, affect, the, environment, but, also, human, health, with, acidic, ph, levels, in, humans, comes, hair, loss, low, urinary, ph, severe, mineral, imbalances, constipation, and, many, cases, of, chronic, disorders, like, fibromyalgia, and, basal, carcinoma, combustion, of, fuels, and, smelting, of, some, ores, produce, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitric, oxides, they, are, converted, into, sulfuric, acid, and, nitric, acid, in, the, gas, phase, sulfur, dioxide, is, oxidized, to, sulfuric, acid, nitrogen, dioxide, reacts, with, hydroxyl, radicals, to, form, nitric, acid, the, detailed, mechanisms, depend, on, the, presence, water, and, traces, of, iron, and, manganese, a, number, of, oxidants, are, capable, of, these, reactions, aside, from, o, 2, these, include, ozone, hydrogen, peroxide, and, oxygen, wet, deposition, of, acids, occurs, when, any, form, of, precipitation, rain, snow, and, so, on, removes, acids, from, the, atmosphere, and, delivers, it, to, the, earth, s, surface, this, can, result, from, the, deposition, of, acids, produced, in, the, raindrops, see, aqueous, phase, chemistry, above, or, by, the, precipitation, removing, the, acids, either, in, clouds, or, below, clouds, wet, removal, of, both, gases, and, aerosols, are, both, of, importance, for, wet, deposition, cam, plants, are, predominantly, found, in, arid, environments, where, water, availability, is, limited, acid, deposition, also, occurs, via, dry, deposition, in, the, absence, of, precipitation, this, can, be, responsible, for, as, much, as, 20, to, 60, of, total, acid, deposition, this, occurs, when, particles, and, gases, stick, to, the, ground, plants, or, other, surfaces, acid, rain, has, been, shown, to, have, adverse, impacts, on, forests, freshwaters, and, soils, killing, insect, and, aquatic, life, forms, as, well, as, causing, damage, to, buildings, and, having, impacts, on, human, health, sulfuric, acid, and, nitric, acid, have, multiple, impacts, on, aquatic, ecosystems, including, acidification, increased, nitrogen, and, aluminum, content, and, alteration, of, biogeochemical, processes, both, the, lower, ph, and, higher, aluminium, concentrations, in, surface, water, that, occur, as, a, result, of, acid, rain, can, cause, damage, to, fish, and, other, aquatic, animals, at, ph, lower, than, 5, most, fish, eggs, will, not, hatch, and, lower, ph, can, kill, adult, fish, as, lakes, and, rivers, become, more, acidic, biodiversity, is, reduced, acid, rain, has, eliminated, insect, life, and, some, fish, species, including, the, brook, trout, in, some, lakes, streams, and, creeks, in, geographically, sensitive, areas, such, as, the, adirondack, mountains, of, the, united, states, however, the, extent, to, which, acid, rain, contributes, directly, or, indirectly, via, runoff, from, the, catchment, to, lake, and, river, acidity, i, e, depending, on, characteristics, of, the, surrounding, watershed, is, variable, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, s, epa, website, states, of, the, lakes, and, streams, surveyed, acid, rain, caused, acidity, in, 75, of, the, acidic, lakes, and, about, 50, of, the, acidic, streams, lakes, hosted, by, silicate, basement, rocks, are, more, acidic, than, lakes, within, limestone, or, other, basement, rocks, with, a, carbonate, composition, i, e, marble, due, to, buffering, effects, by, carbonate, minerals, even, with, the, same, amount, of, acid, rain, soil, biology, and, chemistry, can, be, seriously, damaged, by, acid, rain, some, microbes, are, unable, to, tolerate, changes, to, low, ph, and, are, killed, the, enzymes, of, these, microbes, are, denatured, changed, in, shape, so, they, no, longer, function, by, the, acid, the, hydronium, ions, of, acid, rain, also, mobilize, toxins, such, as, aluminium, and, leach, away, essential, nutrients, and, minerals, such, as, magnesium, soil, chemistry, can, be, dramatically, changed, when, base, cations, such, as, calcium, and, magnesium, are, leached, by, acid, rain, thereby, affecting, sensitive, species, such, as, sugar, maple, acer, saccharum, soil, acidification, impacts, of, acidic, water, and, soil, acidification, on, plants, could, be, minor, or, in, most, cases, major, most, minor, cases, which, do, not, result, in, fatality, of, plant, life, can, be, attributed, to, the, plants, being, less, susceptible, to, acidic, conditions, and, or, the, acid, rain, being, less, potent, however, even, in, minor, cases, the, plant, will, eventually, die, due, to, the, acidic, water, lowering, the, plant, s, natural, ph, acidic, water, enters, the, plant, and, causes, important, plant, minerals, to, dissolve, and, get, carried, away, which, ultimately, causes, the, plant, to, die, of, lack, of, minerals, for, nutrition, in, major, cases, which, are, more, extreme, the, same, process, of, damage, occurs, as, in, minor, cases, which, is, removal, of, essential, minerals, but, at, a, much, quicker, rate, likewise, acid, rain, that, falls, on, soil, and, on, plant, leaves, causes, drying, of, the, waxy, leaf, cuticle, which, ultimately, causes, rapid, water, loss, from, the, plant, to, the, outside, atmosphere, and, eventually, results, in, death, of, the, plant, soil, acidification, can, lead, to, a, decline, in, soil, microbes, as, a, result, of, a, change, in, ph, which, would, have, an, adverse, effect, on, plants, due, to, their, dependence, on, soil, microbes, to, access, nutrients, to, see, if, a, plant, is, being, affected, by, soil, acidification, one, can, closely, observe, the, plant, leaves, if, the, leaves, are, green, and, look, healthy, the, soil, ph, is, normal, and, acceptable, for, plant, life, but, if, the, plant, leaves, have, yellowing, between, the, veins, on, their, leaves, that, means, the, plant, is, suffering, from, acidification, and, is, unhealthy, moreover, a, plant, suffering, from, soil, acidification, cannot, photosynthesize, the, acid, water, induced, process, of, drying, out, of, the, plant, can, destroy, chloroplast, organelles, without, being, able, to, photosynthesize, a, plant, cannot, create, nutrients, for, its, own, survival, or, oxygen, for, the, survival, of, aerobic, organisms, which, affects, most, species, on, earth, and, ultimately, ends, the, purpose, of, the, plant, s, existence, adverse, effects, may, be, indirectly, related, to, acid, rain, like, the, acid, s, effects, on, soil, see, above, or, high, concentration, of, gaseous, precursors, to, acid, rain, high, altitude, forests, are, especially, vulnerable, as, they, are, often, surrounded, by, clouds, and, fog, which, are, more, acidic, than, rain, plants, are, capable, of, adapting, to, acid, rain, on, jinyun, mountain, chongqing, plant, species, were, seen, adapting, to, new, environmental, conditions, the, affects, on, the, species, ranged, from, being, beneficial, to, detrimental, with, natural, rainfall, or, mild, acid, rainfall, the, biochemical, and, physiological, characteristics, of, plant, seedlings, were, enhanced, once, the, ph, increases, reaches, the, threshold, of, 3, 5, the, acid, rain, can, no, longer, be, beneficial, and, begins, to, have, negative, affects, acid, rain, can, negatively, impact, photosynthesis, in, plant, leaves, when, leaves, are, exposed, to, a, lower, ph, photosynthesis, is, impacted, due, to, the, decline, in, chlorophyll, acid, rain, also, has, the, ability, to, cause, deformation, to, leaves, at, a, cellular, level, examples, include, tissue, scaring, and, changes, to, the, stomatal, epidermis, and, mesophyll, cells, additional, impacts, of, acid, rain, includes, a, decline, in, cuticle, thickness, present, on, the, leaf, surface, because, acid, rain, damages, leaves, this, directly, impacts, a, plants, ability, to, have, a, strong, canopy, cover, a, decline, in, canopy, cover, can, lead, plants, to, be, more, vulnerable, to, diseases, dead, or, dying, trees, often, appear, in, areas, impacted, by, acid, rain, acid, rain, causes, aluminum, to, leach, from, the, soil, posing, risks, to, both, plant, and, animal, life, furthermore, it, strips, the, soil, of, critical, minerals, and, nutrients, necessary, for, tree, growth, at, higher, altitudes, acidic, fog, and, clouds, can, deplete, nutrients, from, tree, foliage, leading, to, discolored, or, dead, leaves, and, needles, this, depletion, compromises, the, trees, ability, to, absorb, sunlight, weakening, them, and, diminishing, their, capacity, to, endure, cold, conditions, other, plants, can, also, be, damaged, by, acid, rain, but, the, effect, on, food, crops, is, minimized, by, the, application, of, lime, and, fertilizers, to, replace, lost, nutrients, in, cultivated, areas, limestone, may, also, be, added, to, increase, the, ability, of, the, soil, to, keep, the, ph, stable, but, this, tactic, is, largely, unusable, in, the, case, of, wilderness, lands, when, calcium, is, leached, from, the, needles, of, red, spruce, these, trees, become, less, cold, tolerant, and, exhibit, winter, injury, and, even, death, acid, rain, may, also, affect, crop, productivity, by, necrosis, or, changes, to, soil, nutrients, which, ultimately, prevent, plants, from, reaching, maturity, acid, rain, has, a, much, less, harmful, effect, on, oceans, on, a, global, scale, but, it, creates, an, amplified, impact, in, the, shallower, waters, of, coastal, waters, acid, rain, can, cause, the, ocean, s, ph, to, fall, known, as, ocean, acidification, making, it, more, difficult, for, different, coastal, species, to, create, their, exoskeletons, that, they, need, to, survive, these, coastal, species, link, together, as, part, of, the, ocean, s, food, chain, and, without, them, being, a, source, for, other, marine, life, to, feed, off, of, more, marine, life, will, die, coral, s, limestone, skeleton, is, particularly, sensitive, to, ph, decreases, because, the, calcium, carbonate, a, core, component, of, the, limestone, skeleton, dissolves, in, acidic, low, ph, solutions, in, addition, to, acidification, excess, nitrogen, inputs, from, the, atmosphere, promote, increased, growth, of, phytoplankton, and, other, marine, plants, which, in, turn, may, cause, more, frequent, harmful, algal, blooms, and, eutrophication, the, creation, of, oxygen, depleted, dead, zones, in, some, parts, of, the, ocean, acid, rain, can, negatively, impact, human, health, especially, when, people, breathe, in, particles, released, from, acid, rain, the, effects, of, acid, rain, on, human, health, are, complex, and, may, be, seen, in, several, ways, such, as, respiratory, issues, for, long, term, exposure, and, indirect, exposure, through, contaminated, food, and, water, sources, exposure, to, air, pollutants, associated, with, acid, rain, such, as, nitrogen, dioxide, no2, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, respiratory, health, water, soluble, nitrogen, dioxide, accumulates, in, the, tiny, airways, where, it, is, transformed, into, nitric, and, nitrous, acids, pneumonia, caused, by, nitric, acids, directly, damages, the, epithelial, cells, lining, the, airways, resulting, in, pulmonary, edema, exposure, to, nitrogen, dioxide, also, reduces, the, immune, response, by, inhibiting, the, generation, of, inflammatory, cytokines, by, alveolar, macrophages, in, response, to, bacterial, infection, in, animal, studies, the, pollutant, further, reduces, respiratory, immunity, by, decreasing, mucociliary, clearance, in, the, lower, respiratory, tract, which, results, in, a, reduced, ability, to, remove, respiratory, infections, the, effects, of, sulfur, trioxide, and, sulfuric, acid, are, similar, because, they, both, produce, sulfuric, acid, when, they, come, into, touch, with, the, wet, surfaces, of, your, skin, or, respiratory, system, the, amount, of, so3, breath, through, the, mouth, is, larger, than, the, amount, of, so3, breath, through, the, nose, when, humans, breathe, in, sulfur, trioxide, small, droplets, of, sulfuric, acid, will, form, inside, the, body, and, enter, the, respiratory, tract, to, the, lungs, depending, on, the, particle, size, the, effects, of, so3, on, the, respiratory, system, lead, to, breathing, difficulty, in, people, who, have, asthma, symptoms, sulfur, trioxide, also, causes, very, corrosive, and, irritation, on, the, skin, eye, and, gastrointestinal, tracts, when, there, is, direct, exposure, to, a, specific, concentration, or, long, term, exposure, consuming, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, has, been, known, to, cause, mortality, burn, the, mouth, and, throat, erode, a, hole, in, the, stomach, burns, skin, when, it, comes, into, contact, with, skin, and, make, your, eyes, weep, if, it, gets, into, them, a, 25, parts, per, million, ppm, maximum, for, nitric, oxide, in, working, air, has, been, set, by, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, for, an, 8, hour, workday, and, a, 40, hour, workweek, additionally, osha, has, established, a, 5, ppm, nitrogen, dioxide, exposure, limit, for, 15, minutes, in, the, workplace, the, not, to, exceed, limits, in, the, air, water, soil, or, food, that, are, recommended, by, regulations, are, often, based, on, levels, that, affect, animals, before, being, modified, to, assist, in, safeguarding, people, depending, on, whether, they, employ, different, animal, studies, have, different, exposure, lengths, e, g, an, 8, hour, workday, versus, a, 24, hour, day, or, for, other, reasons, these, not, to, exceed, values, can, vary, between, federal, bodies, the, amount, of, sulfur, dioxide, that, can, be, emitted, into, the, atmosphere, is, capped, by, the, epa, this, reduces, the, quantity, of, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, air, that, turns, into, sulfur, trioxide, and, sulfuric, acid, sulfuric, acid, concentrations, in, workroom, air, are, restricted, by, osha, to, 1, mg, m, moreover, niosh, advises, a, time, weighted, average, limit, of, 1, mg, m, when, you, are, aware, of, no2, and, so3, exposure, you, should, talk, to, your, doctor, and, ask, people, who, are, around, you, especially, children, acid, rain, can, damage, buildings, historic, monuments, and, statues, especially, those, made, of, rocks, such, as, limestone, and, marble, that, contain, large, amounts, of, calcium, carbonate, acids, in, the, rain, react, with, the, calcium, compounds, in, the, stones, to, create, gypsum, which, then, flakes, off, the, effects, of, this, are, commonly, seen, on, old, gravestones, where, acid, rain, can, cause, the, inscriptions, to, become, completely, illegible, acid, rain, also, increases, the, corrosion, rate, of, metals, in, particular, iron, steel, copper, and, bronze, places, significantly, impacted, by, acid, rain, around, the, globe, include, most, of, eastern, europe, from, poland, northward, into, scandinavia, the, eastern, third, of, the, united, states, and, southeastern, canada, other, affected, areas, include, the, southeastern, coast, of, china, and, taiwan, many, coal, firing, power, stations, use, flue, gas, desulfurization, fgd, to, remove, sulfur, containing, gases, from, their, stack, gases, for, a, typical, coal, fired, power, station, fgd, will, remove, 95, or, more, of, the, so, 2, in, the, flue, gases, an, example, of, fgd, is, the, wet, scrubber, which, is, commonly, used, a, wet, scrubber, is, basically, a, reaction, tower, equipped, with, a, fan, that, extracts, hot, smoke, stack, gases, from, a, power, plant, into, the, tower, lime, or, limestone, in, slurry, form, is, also, injected, into, the, tower, to, mix, with, the, stack, gases, and, combine, with, the, sulfur, dioxide, present, the, calcium, carbonate, of, the, limestone, produces, ph, neutral, calcium, sulfate, that, is, physically, removed, from, the, scrubber, that, is, the, scrubber, turns, sulfur, pollution, into, industrial, sulfates, in, some, areas, the, sulfates, are, sold, to, chemical, companies, as, gypsum, when, the, purity, of, calcium, sulfate, is, high, in, others, they, are, placed, in, landfill, the, effects, of, acid, rain, can, last, for, generations, as, the, effects, of, ph, level, change, can, stimulate, the, continued, leaching, of, undesirable, chemicals, into, otherwise, pristine, water, sources, killing, off, vulnerable, insect, and, fish, species, and, blocking, efforts, to, restore, native, life, fluidized, bed, combustion, also, reduces, the, amount, of, sulfur, emitted, by, power, production, vehicle, emissions, control, reduces, emissions, of, nitrogen, oxides, from, motor, vehicles, international, treaties, on, the, long, range, transport, of, atmospheric, pollutants, have, been, agreed, upon, by, western, countries, for, some, time, now, beginning, in, 1979, european, countries, convened, in, order, to, ratify, general, principles, discussed, during, the, unece, convention, the, purpose, was, to, combat, long, range, transboundary, air, pollution, the, 1985, helsinki, protocol, on, the, reduction, of, sulfur, emissions, under, the, convention, on, long, range, transboundary, air, pollution, furthered, the, results, of, the, convention, results, of, the, treaty, have, already, come, to, fruition, as, evidenced, by, an, approximate, 40, percent, drop, in, particulate, matter, in, north, america, the, effectiveness, of, the, convention, in, combatting, acid, rain, has, inspired, further, acts, of, international, commitment, to, prevent, the, proliferation, of, particulate, matter, canada, and, the, us, signed, the, air, quality, agreement, in, 1991, most, european, countries, and, canada, signed, the, treaties, activity, of, the, long, range, transboundary, air, pollution, convention, remained, dormant, after, 1999, when, 27, countries, convened, to, further, reduce, the, effects, of, acid, rain, in, 2000, foreign, cooperation, to, prevent, acid, rain, was, sparked, in, asia, for, the, first, time, ten, diplomats, from, countries, ranging, throughout, the, continent, convened, to, discuss, ways, to, prevent, acid, rain, following, these, discussions, the, acid, deposition, monitoring, network, in, east, asia, eanet, was, established, in, 2001, as, an, intergovernmental, initiative, to, provide, science, based, inputs, for, decision, makers, and, promote, international, cooperation, on, acid, deposition, in, east, asia, in, 2023, the, eanet, member, countries, include, cambodia, china, indonesia, japan, lao, pdr, malaysia, mongolia, myanmar, the, philippines, republic, of, korea, russia, thailand, and, vietnam, in, this, regulatory, scheme, every, current, polluting, facility, is, given, or, may, purchase, on, an, open, market, an, emissions, allowance, for, each, unit, of, a, designated, pollutant, it, emits, operators, can, then, install, pollution, control, equipment, and, sell, portions, of, their, emissions, allowances, they, no, longer, need, for, their, own, operations, thereby, recovering, some, of, the, capital, cost, of, their, investment, in, such, equipment, the, intention, is, to, give, operators, economic, incentives, to, install, pollution, controls, the, first, emissions, trading, market, was, established, in, the, united, states, by, enactment, of, the, clean, air, act, amendments, of, 1990, the, overall, goal, of, the, acid, rain, program, established, by, the, act, is, to, achieve, significant, environmental, and, public, health, benefits, through, reductions, in, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, the, primary, causes, of, acid, rain, to, achieve, this, goal, at, the, lowest, cost, to, society, the, program, employs, both, regulatory, and, market, based, approaches, for, controlling, air, pollution
