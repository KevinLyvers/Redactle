in, physics, the, principle, of, relativity, is, the, requirement, that, the, equations, describing, the, laws, of, physics, have, the, same, form, in, all, admissible, frames, of, reference, for, example, in, the, framework, of, special, relativity, the, maxwell, equations, have, the, same, form, in, all, inertial, frames, of, reference, in, the, framework, of, general, relativity, the, maxwell, equations, or, the, einstein, field, equations, have, the, same, form, in, arbitrary, frames, of, reference, several, principles, of, relativity, have, been, successfully, applied, throughout, science, whether, implicitly, as, in, newtonian, mechanics, or, explicitly, as, in, albert, einstein, s, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, certain, principles, of, relativity, have, been, widely, assumed, in, most, scientific, disciplines, one, of, the, most, widespread, is, the, belief, that, any, law, of, nature, should, be, the, same, at, all, times, and, scientific, investigations, generally, assume, that, laws, of, nature, are, the, same, regardless, of, the, person, measuring, them, these, sorts, of, principles, have, been, incorporated, into, scientific, inquiry, at, the, most, fundamental, of, levels, any, principle, of, relativity, prescribes, a, symmetry, in, natural, law, that, is, the, laws, must, look, the, same, to, one, observer, as, they, do, to, another, according, to, a, theoretical, result, called, noether, s, theorem, any, such, symmetry, will, also, imply, a, conservation, law, alongside, for, example, if, two, observers, at, different, times, see, the, same, laws, then, a, quantity, called, energy, will, be, conserved, in, this, light, relativity, principles, make, testable, predictions, about, how, nature, behaves, according, to, the, first, postulate, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, special, principle, of, relativity, if, a, system, of, coordinates, k, is, chosen, so, that, in, relation, to, it, physical, laws, hold, good, in, their, simplest, form, the, same, laws, hold, good, in, relation, to, any, other, system, of, coordinates, k, moving, in, uniform, translation, relatively, to, k, this, postulate, defines, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, the, special, principle, of, relativity, states, that, physical, laws, should, be, the, same, in, every, inertial, frame, of, reference, but, that, they, may, vary, across, non, inertial, ones, this, principle, is, used, in, both, newtonian, mechanics, and, the, theory, of, special, relativity, its, influence, in, the, latter, is, so, strong, that, max, planck, named, the, theory, after, the, principle, the, principle, requires, physical, laws, to, be, the, same, for, any, body, moving, at, constant, velocity, as, they, are, for, a, body, at, rest, a, consequence, is, that, an, observer, in, an, inertial, reference, frame, cannot, determine, an, absolute, speed, or, direction, of, travel, in, space, and, may, only, speak, of, speed, or, direction, relative, to, some, other, object, the, principle, does, not, extend, to, non, inertial, reference, frames, because, those, frames, do, not, in, general, experience, seem, to, abide, by, the, same, laws, of, physics, in, classical, physics, fictitious, forces, are, used, to, describe, acceleration, in, non, inertial, reference, frames, the, special, principle, of, relativity, was, first, explicitly, enunciated, by, galileo, galilei, in, 1632, in, his, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, using, the, metaphor, of, galileo, s, ship, newtonian, mechanics, added, to, the, special, principle, several, other, concepts, including, laws, of, motion, gravitation, and, an, assertion, of, an, absolute, time, when, formulated, in, the, context, of, these, laws, the, special, principle, of, relativity, states, that, the, laws, of, mechanics, are, invariant, under, a, galilean, transformation, joseph, larmor, and, hendrik, lorentz, discovered, that, maxwell, s, equations, used, in, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, were, invariant, only, by, a, certain, change, of, time, and, length, units, this, left, some, confusion, among, physicists, many, of, whom, thought, that, a, luminiferous, aether, was, incompatible, with, the, relativity, principle, in, the, way, it, was, defined, by, henri, poincar, the, principle, of, relativity, according, to, which, the, laws, of, physical, phenomena, should, be, the, same, whether, for, an, observer, fixed, or, for, an, observer, carried, along, in, a, uniform, movement, of, translation, so, that, we, have, not, and, could, not, have, any, means, of, discerning, whether, or, not, we, are, carried, along, in, such, a, motion, in, their, 1905, papers, on, electrodynamics, henri, poincar, and, albert, einstein, explained, that, with, the, lorentz, transformations, the, relativity, principle, holds, perfectly, einstein, elevated, the, special, principle, of, relativity, to, a, postulate, of, the, theory, and, derived, the, lorentz, transformations, from, this, principle, combined, with, the, principle, of, the, independence, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, from, the, motion, of, the, source, these, two, principles, were, reconciled, with, each, other, by, a, re, examination, of, the, fundamental, meanings, of, space, and, time, intervals, the, strength, of, special, relativity, lies, in, its, use, of, simple, basic, principles, including, the, invariance, of, the, laws, of, physics, under, a, shift, of, inertial, reference, frames, and, the, invariance, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, see, also, lorentz, covariance, it, is, possible, to, derive, the, form, of, the, lorentz, transformations, from, the, principle, of, relativity, alone, using, only, the, isotropy, of, space, and, the, symmetry, implied, by, the, principle, of, special, relativity, one, can, show, that, the, space, time, transformations, between, inertial, frames, are, either, galilean, or, lorentzian, whether, the, transformation, is, actually, galilean, or, lorentzian, must, be, determined, with, physical, experiments, it, is, not, possible, to, conclude, that, the, speed, of, light, c, is, invariant, by, mathematical, logic, alone, in, the, lorentzian, case, one, can, then, obtain, relativistic, interval, conservation, and, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, the, general, principle, of, relativity, states, all, systems, of, reference, are, equivalent, with, respect, to, the, formulation, of, the, fundamental, laws, of, physics, that, is, physical, laws, are, the, same, in, all, reference, frames, inertial, or, non, inertial, an, accelerated, charged, particle, might, emit, synchrotron, radiation, though, a, particle, at, rest, does, not, if, we, consider, now, the, same, accelerated, charged, particle, in, its, non, inertial, rest, frame, it, emits, radiation, at, rest, physics, in, non, inertial, reference, frames, was, historically, treated, by, a, coordinate, transformation, first, to, an, inertial, reference, frame, performing, the, necessary, calculations, therein, and, using, another, to, return, to, the, non, inertial, reference, frame, in, most, such, situations, the, same, laws, of, physics, can, be, used, if, certain, predictable, fictitious, forces, are, added, into, consideration, an, example, is, a, uniformly, rotating, reference, frame, which, can, be, treated, as, an, inertial, reference, frame, if, one, adds, a, fictitious, centrifugal, force, and, coriolis, force, into, consideration, the, problems, involved, are, not, always, so, trivial, special, relativity, predicts, that, an, observer, in, an, inertial, reference, frame, does, not, see, objects, he, would, describe, as, moving, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, however, in, the, non, inertial, reference, frame, of, earth, treating, a, spot, on, the, earth, as, a, fixed, point, the, stars, are, observed, to, move, in, the, sky, circling, once, about, the, earth, per, day, since, the, stars, are, light, years, away, this, observation, means, that, in, the, non, inertial, reference, frame, of, the, earth, anybody, who, looks, at, the, stars, is, seeing, objects, which, appear, to, them, to, be, moving, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, since, non, inertial, reference, frames, do, not, abide, by, the, special, principle, of, relativity, such, situations, are, not, self, contradictory, general, relativity, was, developed, by, einstein, in, the, years, 1907, 1915, general, relativity, postulates, that, the, global, lorentz, covariance, of, special, relativity, becomes, a, local, lorentz, covariance, in, the, presence, of, matter, the, presence, of, matter, curves, spacetime, and, this, curvature, affects, the, path, of, free, particles, and, even, the, path, of, light, general, relativity, uses, the, mathematics, of, differential, geometry, and, tensors, in, order, to, describe, gravitation, as, an, effect, of, the, geometry, of, spacetime, einstein, based, this, new, theory, on, the, general, principle, of, relativity, and, he, named, the, theory, after, the, underlying, principle, see,
