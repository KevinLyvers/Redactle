water, is, an, inorganic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, h, 2, o, it, is, a, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and, nearly, colorless, chemical, substance, it, is, the, main, constituent, of, earth, s, hydrosphere, and, the, fluids, of, all, known, living, organisms, in, which, it, acts, as, a, solvent, it, is, vital, for, all, known, forms, of, life, despite, not, providing, food, energy, or, organic, micronutrients, its, chemical, formula, h, 2, o, indicates, that, each, of, its, molecules, contains, one, oxygen, and, two, hydrogen, atoms, connected, by, covalent, bonds, the, hydrogen, atoms, are, attached, to, the, oxygen, atom, at, an, angle, of, 104, 45, in, liquid, form, h, 2, o, is, also, called, water, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, because, earth, s, environment, is, relatively, close, to, water, s, triple, point, water, exists, on, earth, as, a, solid, a, liquid, and, a, gas, it, forms, precipitation, in, the, form, of, rain, and, aerosols, in, the, form, of, fog, clouds, consist, of, suspended, droplets, of, water, and, ice, its, solid, state, when, finely, divided, crystalline, ice, may, precipitate, in, the, form, of, snow, the, gaseous, state, of, water, is, steam, or, water, vapor, water, covers, about, 71, of, the, earth, s, surface, with, seas, and, oceans, making, up, most, of, the, water, volume, about, 96, 5, small, portions, of, water, occur, as, groundwater, 1, 7, in, the, glaciers, and, the, ice, caps, of, antarctica, and, greenland, 1, 7, and, in, the, air, as, vapor, clouds, consisting, of, ice, and, liquid, water, suspended, in, air, and, precipitation, 0, 001, water, moves, continually, through, the, water, cycle, of, evaporation, transpiration, evapotranspiration, condensation, precipitation, and, runoff, usually, reaching, the, sea, water, plays, an, important, role, in, the, world, economy, approximately, 70, of, the, fresh, water, used, by, humans, goes, to, agriculture, fishing, in, salt, and, fresh, water, bodies, has, been, and, continues, to, be, a, major, source, of, food, for, many, parts, of, the, world, providing, 6, 5, of, global, protein, much, of, the, long, distance, trade, of, commodities, such, as, oil, natural, gas, and, manufactured, products, is, transported, by, boats, through, seas, rivers, lakes, and, canals, large, quantities, of, water, ice, and, steam, are, used, for, cooling, and, heating, in, industry, and, homes, water, is, an, excellent, solvent, for, a, wide, variety, of, substances, both, mineral, and, organic, as, such, it, is, widely, used, in, industrial, processes, and, in, cooking, and, washing, water, ice, and, snow, are, also, central, to, many, sports, and, other, forms, of, entertainment, such, as, swimming, pleasure, boating, boat, racing, surfing, sport, fishing, diving, ice, skating, snowboarding, and, skiing, the, word, water, comes, from, old, english, w, ter, from, proto, germanic, watar, source, also, of, old, saxon, watar, old, frisian, wetir, dutch, water, old, high, german, wazzar, german, wasser, vatn, gothic, wato, from, proto, indo, european, wod, or, suffixed, form, of, root, wed, water, wet, also, cognate, through, the, indo, european, root, with, greek, dor, from, ancient, greek, h, d, r, whence, english, hydro, russian, vod, irish, uisce, and, albanian, uj, one, factor, in, estimating, when, water, appeared, on, earth, is, that, water, is, continually, being, lost, to, space, h, 2, o, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, are, broken, up, by, photolysis, and, the, resulting, free, hydrogen, atoms, can, sometimes, escape, earth, s, gravitational, pull, when, the, earth, was, younger, and, less, massive, water, would, have, been, lost, to, space, more, easily, lighter, elements, like, hydrogen, and, helium, are, expected, to, leak, from, the, atmosphere, continually, but, isotopic, ratios, of, heavier, noble, gases, in, the, modern, atmosphere, suggest, that, even, the, heavier, elements, in, the, early, atmosphere, were, subject, to, significant, losses, in, particular, xenon, is, useful, for, calculations, of, water, loss, over, time, not, only, is, it, a, noble, gas, and, therefore, is, not, removed, from, the, atmosphere, through, chemical, reactions, with, other, elements, but, comparisons, between, the, abundances, of, its, nine, stable, isotopes, in, the, modern, atmosphere, reveal, that, the, earth, lost, at, least, one, ocean, of, water, early, in, its, history, between, the, hadean, and, archean, eons, any, water, on, earth, during, the, latter, part, of, its, accretion, would, have, been, disrupted, by, the, moon, forming, impact, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, which, likely, vaporized, much, of, earth, s, crust, and, upper, mantle, and, created, a, rock, vapor, atmosphere, around, the, young, planet, the, rock, vapor, would, have, condensed, within, two, thousand, years, leaving, behind, hot, volatiles, which, probably, resulted, in, a, majority, carbon, dioxide, atmosphere, with, hydrogen, and, water, vapor, afterward, liquid, water, oceans, may, have, existed, despite, the, surface, temperature, of, 230, c, 446, f, due, to, the, increased, atmospheric, pressure, of, the, co, 2, atmosphere, as, the, cooling, continued, most, co, 2, was, removed, from, the, atmosphere, by, subduction, and, dissolution, in, ocean, water, but, levels, oscillated, wildly, as, new, surface, and, mantle, cycles, appeared, geological, evidence, also, helps, constrain, the, time, frame, for, liquid, water, existing, on, earth, a, sample, of, pillow, basalt, a, type, of, rock, formed, during, an, underwater, eruption, was, recovered, from, the, isua, greenstone, belt, and, provides, evidence, that, water, existed, on, earth, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, in, the, nuvvuagittuq, greenstone, belt, quebec, canada, rocks, dated, at, 3, 8, billion, years, old, by, one, study, and, 4, 28, billion, years, old, by, another, show, evidence, of, the, presence, of, water, at, these, ages, if, oceans, existed, earlier, than, this, any, geological, evidence, has, yet, to, be, discovered, which, may, be, because, such, potential, evidence, has, been, destroyed, by, geological, processes, like, crustal, recycling, more, recently, in, august, 2020, researchers, reported, that, sufficient, water, to, fill, the, oceans, may, have, always, been, on, the, earth, since, the, beginning, of, the, planet, s, formation, water, h, 2, o, is, a, polar, inorganic, compound, at, room, temperature, it, is, a, tasteless, and, odorless, liquid, nearly, colorless, with, a, hint, of, blue, the, simplest, hydrogen, chalcogenide, it, is, by, far, the, most, studied, chemical, compound, and, is, sometimes, described, as, the, universal, solvent, for, its, ability, to, dissolve, more, substances, than, any, other, liquid, though, it, is, poor, at, dissolving, nonpolar, substances, this, allows, it, to, be, the, solvent, of, life, indeed, water, as, found, in, nature, almost, always, includes, various, dissolved, substances, and, special, steps, are, required, to, obtain, chemically, pure, water, water, is, the, only, common, substance, to, exist, as, a, solid, liquid, and, gas, in, normal, terrestrial, conditions, along, with, oxidane, water, is, one, of, the, two, official, names, for, the, chemical, compound, h, 2, o, it, is, also, the, liquid, phase, of, h, 2, o, the, other, two, common, states, of, matter, of, water, are, the, solid, phase, ice, and, the, gaseous, phase, water, vapor, or, steam, the, addition, or, removal, of, heat, can, cause, phase, transitions, freezing, water, to, ice, melting, ice, to, water, vaporization, water, to, vapor, condensation, vapor, to, water, sublimation, ice, to, vapor, and, deposition, vapor, to, ice, water, differs, from, most, liquids, in, that, it, becomes, less, dense, as, it, freezes, in, 1, atm, pressure, it, reaches, its, maximum, density, of, 999, 972, kg, m, 3, 62, 4262, lb, cu, ft, at, 3, 98, c, 39, 16, f, or, almost, 1, 000, kg, m, 3, 62, 43, lb, cu, ft, at, almost, 4, c, 39, f, the, density, of, ice, is, 917, kg, m, 3, 57, 25, lb, cu, ft, an, expansion, of, 9, this, expansion, can, exert, enormous, pressure, bursting, pipes, and, cracking, rocks, in, a, lake, or, ocean, water, at, 4, c, 39, f, sinks, to, the, bottom, and, ice, forms, on, the, surface, floating, on, the, liquid, water, this, ice, insulates, the, water, below, preventing, it, from, freezing, solid, without, this, protection, most, aquatic, organisms, residing, in, lakes, would, perish, during, the, winter, water, is, a, diamagnetic, material, though, interaction, is, weak, with, superconducting, magnets, it, can, attain, a, notable, interaction, at, a, pressure, of, one, atmosphere, atm, ice, melts, or, water, freezes, solidifies, at, 0, c, 32, f, and, water, boils, or, vapor, condenses, at, 100, c, 212, f, however, even, below, the, boiling, point, water, can, change, to, vapor, at, its, surface, by, evaporation, vaporization, throughout, the, liquid, is, known, as, boiling, sublimation, and, deposition, also, occur, on, surfaces, for, example, frost, is, deposited, on, cold, surfaces, while, snowflakes, form, by, deposition, on, an, aerosol, particle, or, ice, nucleus, in, the, process, of, freeze, drying, a, food, is, frozen, and, then, stored, at, low, pressure, so, the, ice, on, its, surface, sublimates, the, melting, and, boiling, points, depend, on, pressure, a, good, approximation, for, the, rate, of, change, of, the, melting, temperature, with, pressure, is, given, by, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, d, t, d, p, t, v, l, v, s, l, f, displaystyle, frac, dt, dp, frac, t, left, v, text, l, v, text, s, right, l, text, f, where, v, l, displaystyle, v, text, l, and, v, s, displaystyle, v, text, s, are, the, molar, volumes, of, the, liquid, and, solid, phases, and, l, f, displaystyle, l, text, f, is, the, molar, latent, heat, of, melting, in, most, substances, the, volume, increases, when, melting, occurs, so, the, melting, temperature, increases, with, pressure, however, because, ice, is, less, dense, than, water, the, melting, temperature, decreases, in, glaciers, pressure, melting, can, occur, under, sufficiently, thick, volumes, of, ice, resulting, in, subglacial, lakes, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, also, applies, to, the, boiling, point, but, with, the, liquid, gas, transition, the, vapor, phase, has, a, much, lower, density, than, the, liquid, phase, so, the, boiling, point, increases, with, pressure, water, can, remain, in, a, liquid, state, at, high, temperatures, in, the, deep, ocean, or, underground, for, example, temperatures, exceed, 205, c, 401, f, in, old, faithful, a, geyser, in, yellowstone, national, park, in, hydrothermal, vents, the, temperature, can, exceed, 400, c, 752, f, at, sea, level, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, 100, c, 212, f, as, atmospheric, pressure, decreases, with, altitude, the, boiling, point, decreases, by, 1, c, every, 274, meters, high, altitude, cooking, takes, longer, than, sea, level, cooking, for, example, at, 1, 524, metres, 5, 000, ft, cooking, time, must, be, increased, by, a, fourth, to, achieve, the, desired, result, conversely, a, pressure, cooker, can, be, used, to, decrease, cooking, times, by, raising, the, boiling, temperature, in, a, vacuum, water, will, boil, at, room, temperature, on, a, pressure, temperature, phase, diagram, see, figure, there, are, curves, separating, solid, from, vapor, vapor, from, liquid, and, liquid, from, solid, these, meet, at, a, single, point, called, the, triple, point, where, all, three, phases, can, coexist, the, triple, point, is, at, a, temperature, of, 273, 16, k, 0, 01, c, 32, 02, f, and, a, pressure, of, 611, 657, pascals, 0, 00604, atm, 0, 0887, psi, it, is, the, lowest, pressure, at, which, liquid, water, can, exist, until, 2019, the, triple, point, was, used, to, define, the, kelvin, temperature, scale, the, water, vapor, phase, curve, terminates, at, 647, 096, k, 373, 946, c, 705, 103, f, and, 22, 064, megapascals, 3, 200, 1, psi, 217, 75, atm, this, is, known, as, the, critical, point, at, higher, temperatures, and, pressures, the, liquid, and, vapor, phases, form, a, continuous, phase, called, a, supercritical, fluid, it, can, be, gradually, compressed, or, expanded, between, gas, like, and, liquid, like, densities, its, properties, which, are, quite, different, from, those, of, ambient, water, are, sensitive, to, density, for, example, for, suitable, pressures, and, temperatures, it, can, mix, freely, with, nonpolar, compounds, including, most, organic, compounds, this, makes, it, useful, in, a, variety, of, applications, including, high, temperature, electrochemistry, and, as, an, ecologically, benign, solvent, or, catalyst, in, chemical, reactions, involving, organic, compounds, in, earth, s, mantle, it, acts, as, a, solvent, during, mineral, formation, dissolution, and, deposition, the, normal, form, of, ice, on, the, surface, of, earth, is, ice, i, h, a, phase, that, forms, crystals, with, hexagonal, symmetry, another, with, cubic, crystalline, symmetry, ice, i, c, can, occur, in, the, upper, atmosphere, as, the, pressure, increases, ice, forms, other, crystal, structures, as, of, 2024, twenty, have, been, experimentally, confirmed, and, several, more, are, predicted, theoretically, the, eighteenth, form, of, ice, ice, xviii, a, face, centred, cubic, superionic, ice, phase, was, discovered, when, a, droplet, of, water, was, subject, to, a, shock, wave, that, raised, the, water, s, pressure, to, millions, of, atmospheres, and, its, temperature, to, thousands, of, degrees, resulting, in, a, structure, of, rigid, oxygen, atoms, in, which, hydrogen, atoms, flowed, freely, when, sandwiched, between, layers, of, graphene, ice, forms, a, square, lattice, the, details, of, the, chemical, nature, of, liquid, water, are, not, well, understood, some, theories, suggest, that, its, unusual, behavior, is, due, to, the, existence, of, two, liquid, states, pure, water, is, usually, described, as, tasteless, and, odorless, although, humans, have, specific, sensors, that, can, feel, the, presence, of, water, in, their, mouths, and, frogs, are, known, to, be, able, to, smell, it, however, water, from, ordinary, sources, including, mineral, water, usually, has, many, dissolved, substances, that, may, give, it, varying, tastes, and, odors, humans, and, other, animals, have, developed, senses, that, enable, them, to, evaluate, the, potability, of, water, in, order, to, avoid, water, that, is, too, salty, or, putrid, pure, water, is, visibly, blue, due, to, absorption, of, light, in, the, region, c, 600, 800, nm, the, color, can, be, easily, observed, in, a, glass, of, tap, water, placed, against, a, pure, white, background, in, daylight, the, principal, absorption, bands, responsible, for, the, color, are, overtones, of, the, o, h, stretching, vibrations, the, apparent, intensity, of, the, color, increases, with, the, depth, of, the, water, column, following, beer, s, law, this, also, applies, for, example, with, a, swimming, pool, when, the, light, source, is, sunlight, reflected, from, the, pool, s, white, tiles, in, nature, the, color, may, also, be, modified, from, blue, to, green, due, to, the, presence, of, suspended, solids, or, algae, in, industry, near, infrared, spectroscopy, is, used, with, aqueous, solutions, as, the, greater, intensity, of, the, lower, overtones, of, water, means, that, glass, cuvettes, with, short, path, length, may, be, employed, to, observe, the, fundamental, stretching, absorption, spectrum, of, water, or, of, an, aqueous, solution, in, the, region, around, 3, 500, cm, 1, 2, 85, m, a, path, length, of, about, 25, m, is, needed, also, the, cuvette, must, be, both, transparent, around, 3500, cm, 1, and, insoluble, in, water, calcium, fluoride, is, one, material, that, is, in, common, use, for, the, cuvette, windows, with, aqueous, solutions, the, raman, active, fundamental, vibrations, may, be, observed, with, for, example, a, 1, cm, sample, cell, aquatic, plants, algae, and, other, photosynthetic, organisms, can, live, in, water, up, to, hundreds, of, meters, deep, because, sunlight, can, reach, them, practically, no, sunlight, reaches, the, parts, of, the, oceans, below, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, of, depth, the, refractive, index, of, liquid, water, 1, 333, at, 20, c, 68, f, is, much, higher, than, that, of, air, 1, 0, similar, to, those, of, alkanes, and, ethanol, but, lower, than, those, of, glycerol, 1, 473, benzene, 1, 501, carbon, disulfide, 1, 627, and, common, types, of, glass, 1, 4, to, 1, 6, the, refraction, index, of, ice, 1, 31, is, lower, than, that, of, liquid, water, in, a, water, molecule, the, hydrogen, atoms, form, a, 104, 5, angle, with, the, oxygen, atom, the, hydrogen, atoms, are, close, to, two, corners, of, a, tetrahedron, centered, on, the, oxygen, at, the, other, two, corners, are, lone, pairs, of, valence, electrons, that, do, not, participate, in, the, bonding, in, a, perfect, tetrahedron, the, atoms, would, form, a, 109, 5, angle, but, the, repulsion, between, the, lone, pairs, is, greater, than, the, repulsion, between, the, hydrogen, atoms, the, o, h, bond, length, is, about, 0, 096, nm, other, substances, have, a, tetrahedral, molecular, structure, for, example, methane, ch, 4, and, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, however, oxygen, is, more, electronegative, than, most, other, elements, so, the, oxygen, atom, has, a, negative, partial, charge, while, the, hydrogen, atoms, are, partially, positively, charged, along, with, the, bent, structure, this, gives, the, molecule, an, electrical, dipole, moment, and, it, is, classified, as, a, polar, molecule, water, is, a, good, polar, solvent, dissolving, many, salts, and, hydrophilic, organic, molecules, such, as, sugars, and, simple, alcohols, such, as, ethanol, water, also, dissolves, many, gases, such, as, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, the, latter, giving, the, fizz, of, carbonated, beverages, sparkling, wines, and, beers, in, addition, many, substances, in, living, organisms, such, as, proteins, dna, and, polysaccharides, are, dissolved, in, water, the, interactions, between, water, and, the, subunits, of, these, biomacromolecules, shape, protein, folding, dna, base, pairing, and, other, phenomena, crucial, to, life, hydrophobic, effect, many, organic, substances, such, as, fats, and, oils, and, alkanes, are, hydrophobic, that, is, insoluble, in, water, many, inorganic, substances, are, insoluble, too, including, most, metal, oxides, sulfides, and, silicates, because, of, its, polarity, a, molecule, of, water, in, the, liquid, or, solid, state, can, form, up, to, four, hydrogen, bonds, with, neighboring, molecules, hydrogen, bonds, are, about, ten, times, as, strong, as, the, van, der, waals, force, that, attracts, molecules, to, each, other, in, most, liquids, this, is, the, reason, why, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, water, are, much, higher, than, those, of, other, analogous, compounds, like, hydrogen, sulfide, they, also, explain, its, exceptionally, high, specific, heat, capacity, about, 4, 2, j, g, k, heat, of, fusion, about, 333, j, g, heat, of, vaporization, 2257, j, g, and, thermal, conductivity, between, 0, 561, and, 0, 679, w, m, k, these, properties, make, water, more, effective, at, moderating, earth, s, climate, by, storing, heat, and, transporting, it, between, the, oceans, and, the, atmosphere, the, hydrogen, bonds, of, water, are, around, 23, kj, mol, compared, to, a, covalent, o, h, bond, at, 492, kj, mol, of, this, it, is, estimated, that, 90, is, attributable, to, electrostatics, while, the, remaining, 10, is, partially, covalent, these, bonds, are, the, cause, of, water, s, high, surface, tension, and, capillary, forces, the, capillary, action, refers, to, the, tendency, of, water, to, move, up, a, narrow, tube, against, the, force, of, gravity, this, property, is, relied, upon, by, all, vascular, plants, such, as, trees, water, is, a, weak, solution, of, hydronium, hydroxide, there, is, an, equilibrium, 2h, 2, o, h, 3, o, oh, in, combination, with, solvation, of, the, resulting, hydronium, and, hydroxide, ions, pure, water, has, a, low, electrical, conductivity, which, increases, with, the, dissolution, of, a, small, amount, of, ionic, material, such, as, common, salt, liquid, water, can, be, split, into, the, elements, hydrogen, and, oxygen, by, passing, an, electric, current, through, it, a, process, called, electrolysis, the, decomposition, requires, more, energy, input, than, the, heat, released, by, the, inverse, process, 285, 8, kj, mol, or, 15, 9, mj, kg, liquid, water, can, be, assumed, to, be, incompressible, for, most, purposes, its, compressibility, ranges, from, 4, 4, to, 5, 1, 10, 10, pa, 1, in, ordinary, conditions, even, in, oceans, at, 4, km, depth, where, the, pressure, is, 400, atm, water, suffers, only, a, 1, 8, decrease, in, volume, the, viscosity, of, water, is, about, 10, 3, pa, s, or, 0, 01, poise, at, 20, c, 68, f, and, the, speed, of, sound, in, liquid, water, ranges, between, 1, 400, and, 1, 540, metres, per, second, 4, 600, and, 5, 100, ft, s, depending, on, temperature, sound, travels, long, distances, in, water, with, little, attenuation, especially, at, low, frequencies, roughly, 0, 03, db, km, for, 1, k, hz, a, property, that, is, exploited, by, cetaceans, and, humans, for, communication, and, environment, sensing, sonar, metallic, elements, which, are, more, electropositive, than, hydrogen, particularly, the, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, such, as, lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium, and, cesium, displace, hydrogen, from, water, forming, hydroxides, and, releasing, hydrogen, at, high, temperatures, carbon, reacts, with, steam, to, form, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, hydrology, is, the, study, of, the, movement, distribution, and, quality, of, water, throughout, the, earth, the, study, of, the, distribution, of, water, is, hydrography, the, study, of, the, distribution, and, movement, of, groundwater, is, hydrogeology, of, glaciers, is, glaciology, of, inland, waters, is, limnology, and, distribution, of, oceans, is, oceanography, ecological, processes, with, hydrology, are, in, the, focus, of, ecohydrology, the, collective, mass, of, water, found, on, under, and, over, the, surface, of, a, planet, is, called, the, hydrosphere, earth, s, approximate, water, volume, the, total, water, supply, of, the, world, is, 1, 386, billion, cubic, kilometres, 333, million, cubic, miles, liquid, water, is, found, in, bodies, of, water, such, as, an, ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, canal, pond, or, puddle, the, majority, of, water, on, earth, is, seawater, water, is, also, present, in, the, atmosphere, in, solid, liquid, and, vapor, states, it, also, exists, as, groundwater, in, aquifers, water, is, important, in, many, geological, processes, groundwater, is, present, in, most, rocks, and, the, pressure, of, this, groundwater, affects, patterns, of, faulting, water, in, the, mantle, is, responsible, for, the, melt, that, produces, volcanoes, at, subduction, zones, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, water, is, important, in, both, chemical, and, physical, weathering, processes, water, and, to, a, lesser, but, still, significant, extent, ice, are, also, responsible, for, a, large, amount, of, sediment, transport, that, occurs, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, deposition, of, transported, sediment, forms, many, types, of, sedimentary, rocks, which, make, up, the, geologic, record, of, earth, history, the, water, cycle, known, scientifically, as, the, hydrologic, cycle, is, the, continuous, exchange, of, water, within, the, hydrosphere, between, the, atmosphere, soil, water, surface, water, groundwater, and, plants, water, moves, perpetually, through, each, of, these, regions, in, the, water, cycle, consisting, of, the, following, transfer, processes, most, water, vapors, found, mostly, in, the, ocean, returns, to, it, but, winds, carry, water, vapor, over, land, at, the, same, rate, as, runoff, into, the, sea, about, 47, tt, per, year, while, evaporation, and, transpiration, happening, in, land, masses, also, contribute, another, 72, tt, per, year, precipitation, at, a, rate, of, 119, tt, per, year, over, land, has, several, forms, most, commonly, rain, snow, and, hail, with, some, contribution, from, fog, and, dew, dew, is, small, drops, of,

for, the, same, reason, in, places, such, as, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, where, water, is, more, scarce, access, to, clean, drinking, water, was, and, is, a, major, factor, in, human, development, water, fit, for, human, consumption, is, called, drinking, water, or, potable, water, water, that, is, not, potable, may, be, made, potable, by, filtration, or, distillation, or, by, a, range, of, other, methods, more, than, 660, million, people, do, not, have, access, to, safe, drinking, water, water, that, is, not, fit, for, drinking, but, is, not, harmful, to, humans, when, used, for, swimming, or, bathing, is, called, by, various, names, other, than, potable, or, drinking, water, and, is, sometimes, called, safe, water, or, safe, for, bathing, chlorine, is, a, skin, and, mucous, membrane, irritant, that, is, used, to, make, water, safe, for, bathing, or, drinking, its, use, is, highly, technical, and, is, usually, monitored, by, government, regulations, typically, 1,

most, commonly, sewage, also, called, municipal, wastewater, into, water, that, can, be, reused, for, other, purposes, there, are, 2, 3, billion, people, who, reside, in, nations, with, water, scarcities, which, means, that, each, individual, receives, less, than, 1, 700, cubic, metres, 60, 000, cu, ft, of, water, annually, 380, billion, cubic, metres, 13, 10, 12, cu, ft, of, municipal, wastewater, are, produced, globally, each, year, freshwater, is, a, renewable, resource, recirculated, by, the, natural, hydrologic, cycle, but, pressures, over, access, to, it, result, from, the, naturally, uneven, distribution, in, space, and, time, growing, economic, demands, by, agriculture, and, industry, and, rising, populations, currently, nearly, a, billion, people, around, the, world, lack, access, to, safe, affordable, water, in, 2000, the, united, nations, established, the, millennium, development, goals, for, water, to, halve, by, 2015, the, proportion, of, people, worldwide, without, access, to, safe, water, and, sanitation, progress, toward, that, goal, was, uneven, and, in, 2015, the, un, committed, to, the, sustainable, development, goals, of, achieving, universal, access, to, safe, and, affordable, water, and, sanitation, by, 2030, poor, water, quality, and, bad, sanitation, are, deadly, some, five, million, deaths, a, year, are, caused, by, water, related, diseases, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, safe, water, could, prevent, 1, 4, million, child, deaths, from, diarrhea, each, year, in, developing, countries, 90, of, all, municipal, wastewater, still, goes, untreated, into, local, rivers, and, streams, some, 50, countries, with, roughly, a, third, of, the, world, s, population, also, suffer, from, medium, or, high, water, scarcity, and, 17, of, these, extract, more, water, annually, than, is, recharged, through, their, natural, water, cycles, the, strain, not, only, affects, surface, freshwater, bodies, like, rivers, and, lakes, but, it, also, degrades, groundwater, resources, the, most, substantial, human, use, of, water, is, for, agriculture, including, irrigated, agriculture, which, accounts, for, as, much, as, 80, to, 90, percent, of, total, human, water, consumption, in, the, united, states, 42, of, freshwater, withdrawn, for, use, is, for, irrigation, but, the, vast, majority, of, water, consumed, used, and, not, returned, to, the, environment, goes, to, agriculture, access, to, fresh, water, is, often, taken, for, granted, especially, in, developed, countries, that, have, built, sophisticated, water, systems, for, collecting, purifying, and, delivering, water, and, removing, wastewater, but, growing, economic, demographic, and, climatic, pressures, are, increasing, concerns, about, water, issues, leading, to, increasing, competition, for, fixed, water, resources, giving, rise, to, the, concept, of, peak, water, as, populations, and, economies, continue, to, grow, consumption, of, water, thirsty, meat, expands, and, new, demands, rise, for, biofuels, or, new, water, intensive, industries, new, water, challenges, are, likely, an, assessment, of, water, management, in, agriculture, was, conducted, in, 2007, by, the, international, water, management, institute, in, sri, lanka, to, see, if, the, world, had, sufficient, water, to, provide, food, for, its, growing, population, it, assessed, the, current, availability, of, water, for, agriculture, on, a, global, scale, and, mapped, out, locations, suffering, from, water, scarcity, it, found, that, a, fifth, of, the, world, s, people, more, than, 1, 2, billion, live, in, areas, of, physical, water, scarcity, where, there, is, not, enough, water, to, meet, all, demands, a, further, 1, 6, billion, people, live, in, areas, experiencing, economic, water, scarcity, where, the, lack, of, investment, in, water, or, insufficient, human, capacity, make, it, impossible, for, authorities, to, satisfy, the, demand, for, water, the, report, found, that, it, would, be, possible, to, produce, the, food, required, in, the, future, but, that, continuation, of, today, s, food, production, and, environmental, trends, would, lead, to, crises, in, many, parts, of, the, world, to, avoid, a, global, water, crisis, farmers, will, have, to, strive, to, increase, productivity, to, meet, growing, demands, for, food, while, industries, and, cities, find, ways, to, use, water, more, efficiently, water, scarcity, is, also, caused, by, production, of, water, intensive, products, for, example, cotton, 1, kg, of, cotton, equivalent, of, a, pair, of, jeans, requires, 10, 9, cubic, metres, 380, cu, ft, water, to, produce, while, cotton, accounts, for, 2, 4, of, world, water, use, the, water, is, consumed, in, regions, that, are, already, at, a, risk, of, water, shortage, significant, environmental, damage, has, been, caused, for, example, the, diversion, of, water, by, the, former, soviet, union, from, the, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, rivers, to, produce, cotton, was, largely, responsible, for, the, disappearance, of, the, aral, sea, on, 7, april, 1795, the, gram, was, defined, in, france, to, be, equal, to, the, absolute, weight, of, a, volume, of, pure, water, equal, to, a, cube, of, one, hundredth, of, a, meter, and, at, the, temperature, of, melting, ice, for, practical, purposes, though, a, metallic, reference, standard, was, required, one, thousand, times, more, massive, the, kilogram, work, was, therefore, commissioned, to, determine, precisely, the, mass, of, one, liter, of, water, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, the, decreed, definition, of, the, gram, specified, water, at, 0, c, 32, f, a, highly, reproducible, temperature, the, scientists, chose, to, redefine, the, standard, and, to, perform, their, measurements, at, the, temperature, of, highest, water, density, which, was, measured, at, the, time, as, 4, c, 39, f, the, kelvin, temperature, scale, of, the, si, system, was, based, on, the, triple, point, of, water, defined, as, exactly, 273, 16, k, 0, 01, c, 32, 02, f, but, as, of, may, 2019, is, based, on, the, boltzmann, constant, instead, the, scale, is, an, absolute, temperature, scale, with, the, same, increment, as, the, celsius, temperature, scale, which, was, originally, defined, according, to, the, boiling, point, set, to, 100, c, 212, f, and, melting, point, set, to, 0, c, 32, f, of, water, natural, water, consists, mainly, of, the, isotopes, hydrogen, 1, and, oxygen, 16, but, there, is, also, a, small, quantity, of, heavier, isotopes, oxygen, 18, oxygen, 17, and, hydrogen, 2, deuterium, the, percentage, of, the, heavier, isotopes, is, very, small, but, it, still, affects, the, properties, of, water, water, from, rivers, and, lakes, tends, to, contain, less, heavy, isotopes, than, seawater, therefore, standard, water, is, defined, in, the, vienna, standard, mean, ocean, water, specification, the, human, body, contains, from, 55, to, 78, water, depending, on, body, size, to, function, properly, the, body, requires, between, one, and, seven, litres, 0, 22, and, 1, 54, imp, gal, 0, 26, and, 1, 85, us, gal, of, water, per, day, to, avoid, dehydration, the, precise, amount, depends, on, the, level, of, activity, temperature, humidity, and, other, factors, most, of, this, is, ingested, through, foods, or, beverages, other, than, drinking, straight, water, it, is, not, clear, how, much, water, intake, is, needed, by, healthy, people, though, the, british, dietetic, association, advises, that, 2, 5, liters, of, total, water, daily, is, the, minimum, to, maintain, proper, hydration, including, 1, 8, liters, 6, to, 7, glasses, obtained, directly, from, beverages, medical, literature, favors, a, lower, consumption, typically, 1, liter, of, water, for, an, average, male, excluding, extra, requirements, due, to, fluid, loss, from, exercise, or, warm, weather, healthy, kidneys, can, excrete, 0, 8, to, 1, liter, of, water, per, hour, but, stress, such, as, exercise, can, reduce, this, amount, people, can, drink, far, more, water, than, necessary, while, exercising, putting, them, at, risk, of, water, intoxication, hyperhydration, which, can, be, fatal, the, popular, claim, that, a, person, should, consume, eight, glasses, of, water, per, day, seems, to, have, no, real, basis, in, science, studies, have, shown, that, extra, water, intake, especially, up, to, 500, millilitres, 18, imp, fl, oz, 17, us, fl, oz, at, mealtime, was, associated, with, weight, loss, adequate, fluid, intake, is, helpful, in, preventing, constipation, an, original, recommendation, for, water, intake, in, 1945, by, the, food, and, nutrition, board, of, the, u, s, national, research, council, read, an, ordinary, standard, for, diverse, persons, is, 1, milliliter, for, each, calorie, of, food, most, of, this, quantity, is, contained, in, prepared, foods, the, latest, dietary, reference, intake, report, by, the, u, s, national, research, council, in, general, recommended, based, on, the, median, total, water, intake, from, us, survey, data, including, food, sources, 3, 7, litres, 0, 81, imp, gal, 0, 98,

in, the, survey, specifically, pregnant, and, breastfeeding, women, need, additional, fluids, to, stay, hydrated, the, us, institute, of, medicine, recommends, that, on, average, men, consume, 3, litres, 0, 66, imp, gal, 0, 79, us, gal, and, women, 2, 2, litres, 0, 48, imp, gal, 0, 58, us, gal, pregnant, women, should, increase, intake, to, 2, 4, litres, 0, 53, imp, gal, 0, 63, us, gal, and, breastfeeding, women, should, get, 3, liters, 12, cups, since, an, especially, large, amount, of, fluid, is, lost, during, nursing, also, noted, is, that, normally, about, 20, of, water, intake, comes, from, food, while, the, rest, comes, from, drinking, water, and, beverages, caffeinated, included, water, is, excreted, from, the, body, in, multiple, forms, through, urine, and, feces, through, sweating, and, by, exhalation, of, water, vapor, in, the, breath, with, physical, exertion, and, heat, exposure, water, loss, will, increase, and, daily, fluid, needs, may, increase, as, well, humans, require, water, with, few, impurities, common, impurities, include, metal, salts, and, oxides, including, copper, iron, calcium, and, lead, and, harmful, bacteria, such, as, vibrio, some, solutes, are, acceptable, and, even, desirable, for, taste, enhancement, and, to, provide, needed, electrolytes, the, single, largest, by, volume, freshwater, resource, suitable, for, drinking,

transport, by, sea, has, been, widely, used, throughout, recorded, history, the, advent, of, aviation, has, diminished, the, importance, of, sea, travel, for, passengers, though, it, is, still, popular, for, short, trips, and, pleasure, cruises, transport, by, water, is, cheaper, than, transport, by, air, or, ground, but, significantly, slower, for, longer, distances, maritime, transport, accounts, for, roughly, 80, of, international, trade, according, to, unctad, in, 2020, maritime, transport, can, be, realized, over, any, distance, by, boat, ship, sailboat, or, barge, over, oceans, and, lakes, through, canals, or, along, rivers, shipping, may, be, for, commerce, recreation, or, military, purposes, while, extensive, inland, shipping, is, less, critical, today, the, major, waterways, of, the, world, including, many, canals, are, still, very, important, and, are, integral, parts, of, worldwide, economies, particularly, especially, any, material, can, be, moved, by, water, however, water, transport, becomes, impractical, when, material, delivery, is, time, critical, such, as, various, types, of, perishable, produce, still, water, transport, is, highly, cost, effective, with, regular, schedulable, cargoes, such, as, trans, oceanic, shipping, of, consumer, products, and, especially, for, heavy, loads, or, bulk, cargos, such, as, coal, coke, ores, or, grains, arguably, the, industrial, revolution, had, its, first, impacts, where, cheap, water, transport, by, canal, navigations, or, shipping, by, all, types, of, watercraft, on, natural, waterways, supported, cost, effective, bulk, transport, water, is, widely, used, in, chemical, reactions, as, a, solvent, or, reactant, and, less, commonly, as, a, solute, or, catalyst, in, inorganic, reactions, water, is, a, common, solvent, dissolving, many, ionic, compounds, as, well, as, other, polar, compounds, such, as, ammonia, and, compounds, closely, related, to, water, in, organic, reactions, it, is, not, usually, used, as, a, reaction, solvent, because, it, does, not, dissolve, the, reactants, well, and, is, amphoteric, acidic, and, basic, and, nucleophilic, nevertheless, these, properties, are, sometimes, desirable, also, acceleration, of, diels, alder, reactions, by, water, has, been, observed, supercritical, water, has, recently, been, a, topic, of, research, oxygen, saturated, supercritical, water, combusts, organic, pollutants, efficiently, water, and, steam, are, a, common, fluid, used, for, heat, exchange, due, to, its, availability, and, high, heat, capacity, both, for, cooling, and, heating, cool, water, may, even, be, naturally, available, from, a, lake, or, the, sea, it, is, especially, effective, to, transport, heat, through, vaporization, and, condensation, of, water, because, of, its, large, latent, heat, of, vaporization, a, disadvantage, is, that, metals, commonly, found, in, industries, such, as, steel, and, copper, are, oxidized, faster, by, untreated, water, and, steam, in, almost, all, thermal, power, stations, water, is, used, as, the, working, fluid, used, in, a, closed, loop, between, boiler, steam, turbine, and, condenser, and, the, coolant, used, to, exchange, the, waste, heat, to, a, water, body, or, carry, it, away, by, evaporation, in, a, cooling, tower, in, the, united, states, cooling, power, plants, is, the, largest, use, of, water, in, the, nuclear, power, industry, water, can, also, be, used, as, a, neutron, moderator, in, most, nuclear, reactors, water, is, both, a, coolant, and, a, moderator, this, provides, something, of, a, passive, safety, measure, as, removing, the, water, from, the, reactor, also, slows, the, nuclear, reaction, down, however, other, methods, are, favored, for, stopping, a, reaction, and, it, is, preferred, to, keep, the, nuclear, core, covered, with, water, so, as, to, ensure, adequate, cooling, water, has, a, high, heat, of, vaporization, and, is, relatively, inert, which, makes, it, a, good, fire, extinguishing, fluid, the, evaporation, of, water, carries, heat, away, from, the, fire, it, is, dangerous, to, use, water, on, fires, involving, oils, and, organic, solvents, because, many, organic, materials, float, on, water, and, the, water, tends, to, spread, the, burning, liquid, use, of, water, in, fire, fighting, should, also, take, into, account, the, hazards, of, a, steam, explosion, which, may, occur, when, water, is, used, on, very, hot, fires, in, confined, spaces, and, of, a, hydrogen, explosion, when, substances, which, react, with, water, such, as, certain, metals, or, hot, carbon, such, as, coal, charcoal, or, coke, graphite, decompose, the, water, producing, water, gas, the, power, of, such, explosions, was, seen, in, the, chernobyl, disaster, although, the, water, involved, in, this, case, did, not, come, from, fire, fighting, but, from, the, reactor, s, own, water, cooling, system, a, steam, explosion, occurred, when, the, extreme, overheating, of, the, core, caused, water, to, flash, into, steam, a, hydrogen, explosion, may, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, a, reaction, between, steam, and, hot, zirconium, some, metallic, oxides, most, notably, those, of, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, produce, so, much, heat, in, reaction, with, water, that, a, fire, hazard, can, develop, the, alkaline, earth, oxide, quicklime, also, known, as, calcium, oxide, is, a, mass, produced, substance, that, is, often, transported, in, paper, bags, if, these, are, soaked, through, they, may, ignite, as, their, contents, react, with, water, humans, use, water, for, many, recreational, purposes, as, well, as, for, exercising, and, for, sports, some, of, these, include, swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing, and, diving, in, addition, some, sports, like, ice, hockey, and, ice, skating, are, played, on, ice, lakesides, beaches, and, water, parks, are, popular, places, for, people, to, go, to, relax, and, enjoy, recreation, many, find, the, sound, and, appearance, of, flowing, water, to, be, calming, and, fountains, and, other, flowing, water, structures, are, popular, decorations, some, keep, fish, and, other, flora, and, fauna, inside, aquariums, or, ponds, for, show, fun, and, companionship, humans, also, use, water, for, snow, sports, such, as, skiing, sledding, snowmobiling, or, snowboarding, which, require, the, water, to, be, at, a, low, temperature, either, as, ice, or, crystallized, into, snow, the, water, industry, provides, drinking, water, and, wastewater, services, including, sewage, treatment, to, households, and, industry, water, supply, facilities, include, water, wells, cisterns, for, rainwater, harvesting, water, supply, networks, and, water, purification, facilities, water, tanks, water, towers, water, pipes, including, old, aqueducts, atmospheric, water, generators, are, in, development, drinking, water, is, often, collected, at, springs, extracted, from, artificial, borings, wells, in, the, ground, or, pumped, from, lakes, and, rivers, building, more, wells, in, adequate, places, is, thus, a, possible, way, to, produce, more, water, assuming, the, aquifers, can, supply, an, adequate, flow, other, water, sources, include, rainwater, collection, water, may, require, purification, for, human, consumption, this, may, involve, the, removal, of, undissolved, substances, dissolved, substances, and, harmful, microbes, popular, methods, are, filtering, with, sand, which, only, removes, undissolved, material, while, chlorination, and, boiling, kill, harmful, microbes, distillation, does, all, three, functions, more, advanced, techniques, exist, such, as, reverse, osmosis, desalination, of, abundant, seawater, is, a, more, expensive, solution, used, in, coastal, arid, climates, the, distribution, of, drinking, water, is, done, through, municipal, water, systems, tanker, delivery, or, as, bottled, water, governments, in, many, countries, have, programs, to, distribute, water, to, the, needy, at, no, charge, reducing, usage, by, using, drinking, potable, water, only, for, human, consumption, is, another, option, in, some, cities, such, as, hong, kong, seawater, is, extensively, used, for, flushing, toilets, citywide, in, order, to, conserve, freshwater, resources, polluting, water, may, be, the, biggest, single, misuse, of, water, to, the, extent, that, a, pollutant, limits, other, uses, of, the, water, it, becomes, a, waste, of, the, resource, regardless, of, benefits, to, the, polluter, like, other, types, of, pollution, this, does, not, enter, standard, accounting, of, market, costs, being, conceived, as, externalities, for, which, the, market, cannot, account, thus, other, people, pay, the, price, of, water, pollution, while, the, private, firms, profits, are, not, redistributed, to, the, local, population, victims, of, this, pollution, pharmaceuticals, consumed, by, humans, often, end, up, in, the, waterways, and, can, have, detrimental, effects, on, aquatic, life, if, they, bioaccumulate, and, if, they, are, not, biodegradable, municipal, and, industrial, wastewater, are, typically, treated, at, wastewater, treatment, plants, mitigation, of, polluted, surface, runoff, is, addressed, through, a, variety, of, prevention, and, treatment, techniques, many, industrial, processes, rely, on, reactions, using, chemicals, dissolved, in, water, suspension, of, solids, in, water, slurries, or, using, water, to, dissolve, and, extract, substances, or, to, wash, products, or, process, equipment, processes, such, as, mining, chemical, pulping, pulp, bleaching, paper, manufacturing, textile, production, dyeing, printing, and, cooling, of, power, plants, use, large, amounts, of, water, requiring, a, dedicated, water, source, and, often, cause, significant, water, pollution, water, is, used, in, power, generation, hydroelectricity, is, electricity, obtained, from, hydropower, hydroelectric, power, comes, from, water, driving, a, water, turbine, connected, to, a, generator, hydroelectricity, is, a, low, cost, non, polluting, renewable, energy, source, the, energy, is, supplied, by, the, motion, of, water, typically, a, dam, is, constructed, on, a, river, creating, an, artificial, lake, behind, it, water, flowing, out, of, the, lake, is, forced, through, turbines, that, turn, generators, pressurized, water, is, used, in, water, blasting, and, water, jet, cutters, high, pressure, water, guns, are, used, for, precise, cutting, it, works, very, well, is, relatively, safe, and, is, not, harmful, to, the, environment, it, is, also, used, in, the, cooling, of, machinery, to, prevent, overheating, or, prevent, saw, blades, from, overheating, water, is, also, used, in, many, industrial, processes, and, machines, such, as, the, steam, turbine, and, heat, exchanger, in, addition, to, its, use, as, a, chemical, solvent, discharge, of, untreated, water, from, industrial, uses, is, pollution, pollution, includes, discharged, solutes, chemical, pollution, and, discharged, coolant, water, thermal, pollution, industry, requires, pure, water, for, many, applications, and, uses, a, variety, of, purification, techniques, both, in, water, supply, and, discharge, boiling, steaming, and, simmering, are, popular, cooking, methods, that, often, require, immersing, food, in, water, or, its, gaseous, state, steam, water, is, also, used, for, dishwashing, water, also, plays, many, critical, roles, within, the, field, of, food, science, solutes, such, as, salts, and, sugars, found, in, water, affect, the, physical, properties, of, water, the, boiling, and, freezing, points, of, water, are, affected, by, solutes, as, well, as, air, pressure, which, is, in, turn, affected, by, altitude, water, boils, at, lower, temperatures, with, the, lower, air, pressure, that, occurs, at, higher, elevations, one, mole, of, sucrose, sugar, per, kilogram, of, water, raises, the, boiling, point, of, water, by, 0, 51, c, 0, 918, f, and, one, mole, of, salt, per, kg, raises, the, boiling, point, by, 1, 02, c, 1, 836, f, similarly, increasing, the, number, of, dissolved, particles, lowers, water, s, freezing, point, solutes, in, water, also, affect, water, activity, that, affects, many, chemical, reactions, and, the, growth, of, microbes, in, food, water, activity, can, be, described, as, a, ratio, of, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, a, solution, to, the, vapor, pressure, of, pure, water, solutes, in, water, lower, water, activity, this, is, important, to, know, because, most, bacterial, growth, ceases, at, low, levels, of, water, activity, not, only, does, microbial, growth, affect, the, safety, of, food, but, also, the, preservation, and, shelf, life, of, food, water, hardness, is, also, a, critical, factor, in, food, processing, and, may, be, altered, or, treated, by, using, a, chemical, ion, exchange, system, it, can, dramatically, affect, the, quality, of, a, product, as, well, as, playing, a, role, in, sanitation, water, hardness, is, classified, based, on, concentration, of, calcium, carbonate, the, water, contains, water, is, classified, as, soft, if, it, contains, less, than, 100, mg, l, uk, or, less, than, 60, mg, l, us, according, to, a, report, published, by, the, water, footprint, organization, in, 2010, a, single, kilogram, of, beef, requires, 15, thousand, litres, 3, 3, 10, 3, imp, gal, 4, 0, 10, 3, us, gal, of, water, however, the, authors, also, make, clear, that, this, is, a, global, average, and, circumstantial, factors, determine, the, amount, of, water, used, in, beef, production, water, for, injection, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, much, of, the, universe, s, water, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, star, formation, the, formation, of, stars, is, accompanied, by, a, strong, outward, wind, of, gas, and, dust, when, this, outflow, of, material, eventually, impacts, the, surrounding, gas, the, shock, waves, that, are, created, compress, and, heat, the, gas, the, water, observed, is, quickly, produced, in, this, warm, dense, gas, on, 22, july, 2011, a, report, described, the, discovery, of, a, gigantic, cloud, of, water, vapor, containing, 140, trillion, times, more, water, than, all, of, earth, s, oceans, combined, around, a, quasar, located, 12, billion, light, years, from, earth, according, to, the, researchers, the, discovery, shows, that, water, has, been, prevalent, in, the, universe, for, nearly, its, entire, existence, water, has, been, detected, in, interstellar, clouds, within, the, milky, way, water, probably, exists, in, abundance, in, other, galaxies, too, because, its, components, hydrogen, and, oxygen, are, among, the, most, abundant, elements, in, the, universe, based, on, models, of, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, and, that, of, other, star, systems, most, other, planetary, systems, are, likely, to, have, similar, ingredients, water, is, present, as, vapor, in, liquid, water, is, present, on, earth, covering, 71, of, its, surface, liquid, water, is, also, occasionally, present, in, small, amounts, on, mars, scientists, believe, liquid, water, is, present, in, the, saturnian, moons, of, enceladus, as, a, 10, kilometre, thick, ocean, approximately, 30, 40, kilometers, below, enceladus, south, polar, surface, and, titan, as, a, subsurface, layer, possibly, mixed, with, ammonia, jupiter, s, moon, europa, has, surface, characteristics, which, suggest, a, subsurface, liquid, water, ocean, liquid, water, may, also, exist, on, jupiter, s, moon, ganymede, as, a, layer, sandwiched, between, high, pressure, ice, and, rock, water, is, present, as, ice, on, and, is, also, likely, present, on, water, and, other, volatiles, probably, comprise, much, of, the, internal, structures, of, uranus, and, neptune, and, the, water, in, the, deeper, layers, may, be, in, the, form, of, ionic, water, in, which, the, molecules, break, down, into, a, soup, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, ions, and, deeper, still, as, superionic, water, in, which, the, oxygen, crystallizes, but, the, hydrogen, ions, float, about, freely, within, the, oxygen, lattice, the, existence, of, liquid, water, and, to, a, lesser, extent, its, gaseous, and, solid, forms, on, earth, are, vital, to, the, existence, of, life, on, earth, as, we, know, it, the, earth, is, located, in, the, habitable, zone, of, the, solar, system, if, it, were, slightly, closer, to, or, farther, from, the, sun, about, 5, or, about, 8, million, kilometers, the, conditions, which, allow, the, three, forms, to, be, present, simultaneously, would, be, far, less, likely, to, exist, earth, s, gravity, allows, it, to, hold, an, atmosphere, water, vapor, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, provide, a, temperature, buffer, greenhouse, effect, which, helps, maintain, a, relatively, steady, surface, temperature, if, earth, were, smaller, a, thinner, atmosphere, would, allow, temperature, extremes, thus, preventing, the, accumulation, of, water, except, in, polar, ice, caps, as, on, mars, the, surface, temperature, of, earth, has, been, relatively, constant, through, geologic, time, despite, varying, levels, of, incoming, solar, radiation, insolation, indicating, that, a, dynamic, process, governs, earth, s, temperature, via, a, combination, of, greenhouse, gases, and, surface, or, atmospheric, albedo, this, proposal, is, known, as, the, gaia, hypothesis, the, state, of, water, on, a, planet, depends, on, ambient, pressure, which, is, determined, by, the, planet, s, gravity, if, a, planet, is, sufficiently, massive, the, water, on, it, may, be, solid, even, at, high, temperatures, because, of, the, high, pressure, caused, by, gravity, as, it, was, observed, on, exoplanets, gliese, 436, b, and, gj, 1214, b, water, politics, is, politics, affected, by, water, and, water, resources, water, particularly, fresh, water, is, a, strategic, resource, across, the, world, and, an, important, element, in, many, political, conflicts, it, causes, health, impacts, and, damage, to, biodiversity, access, to, safe, drinking, water, has, improved, over, the, last, decades, in, almost, every, part, of, the, world, but, approximately, one, billion, people, still, lack, access, to, safe, water, and, over, 2, 5, billion, lack, access, to, adequate, sanitation, however, some, observers, have, estimated, that, by, 2025, more, than, half, of, the, world, population, will, be, facing, water, based, vulnerability, a, report, issued, in, november, 2009, suggests, that, by, 2030, in, some, developing, regions, of, the, world, water, demand, will, exceed, supply, by, 50, 1, 6, billion, people, have, gained, access, to, a, safe, water, source, since, 1990, the, proportion, of, people, in, developing, countries, with, access, to, safe, water, is, calculated, to, have, improved, from, 30, in, 1970, to, 71, in, 1990, 79, in, 2000, and, 84, in, 2004, a, 2006, united, nations, report, stated, that, there, is, enough, water, for, everyone, but, that, access, to, it, is, hampered, by, mismanagement, and, corruption, in, addition, global, initiatives, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, aid, delivery, such, as, the, paris, declaration, on, aid, effectiveness, have, not, been, taken, up, by, water, sector, donors, as, effectively, as, they, have, in, education, and, health, potentially, leaving, multiple, donors, working, on, overlapping, projects, and, recipient, governments, without, empowerment, to, act, the, authors, of, the, 2007, comprehensive, assessment, of, water, management, in, agriculture, cited,

management, are, made, good, water, governance, is, primarily, about, knowing, what, processes, work, best, in, a, particular, physical, and, socioeconomic, context, mistakes, have, sometimes, been, made, by, trying, to, apply, blueprints, that, work, in, the, developed, world, to, developing, world, locations, and, contexts, the, mekong, river, is, one, example, a, review, by, the, international, water, management, institute, of, policies, in, six, countries, that, rely, on, the, mekong, river, for, water, found, that, thorough, and, transparent, cost, benefit, analyses, and, environmental, impact, assessments, were, rarely, undertaken, they, also, discovered, that, cambodia, s, draft, water, law, was, much, more, complex, than, it, needed, to, be, in, 2004, the, uk, charity, wateraid, reported, that, a, child, dies, every, 15, seconds, from, easily, preventable, water, related, diseases, which, are, often, tied, to, a, lack, of, adequate, sanitation, since, 2003, the, un, world, water, development, report, produced, by, the, unesco, world, water, assessment, programme, has, provided, decision, makers, with, tools, for, developing, sustainable, water, policies, the, 2023, report, states, that, two, billion, people, 26, of, the, population, do, not, have, access, to, drinking, water, and, 3, 6, billion, 46, lack, access, to, safely, managed, sanitation, people, in, urban, areas, 2, 4, billion, will, face, water, scarcity, by, 2050, water, scarcity, has, been, described, as, endemic, due, to, overconsumption, and, pollution, the, report, states, that, 10, of, the, world, s, population, lives, in, countries, with, high, or, critical, water, stress, yet, over, the, past, 40, years, water, consumption, has, increased, by, around, 1, per, year, and, is, expected, to, grow, at, the, same, rate, until, 2050, since, 2000, flooding, in, the, tropics, has, quadrupled, while, flooding, in, northern, mid, latitudes, has, increased, by, a, factor, of, 2,
