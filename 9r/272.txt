in, astronomy, metallicity, is, the, abundance, of, elements, present, in, an, object, that, are, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, most, of, the, normal, currently, detectable, i, e, non, dark, matter, in, the, universe, is, either, hydrogen, or, helium, and, astronomers, use, the, word, metals, as, convenient, shorthand, for, all, elements, except, hydrogen, and, helium, this, word, use, is, distinct, from, the, conventional, chemical, or, physical, definition, of, a, metal, as, an, electrically, conducting, solid, stars, and, nebulae, with, relatively, high, abundances, of, heavier, elements, are, called, metal, rich, when, discussing, metallicity, even, though, many, of, those, elements, are, called, nonmetals, in, chemistry, in, 1802, william, hyde, wollaston, noted, the, appearance, of, a, number, of, dark, features, in, the, solar, spectrum, in, 1814, joseph, von, fraunhofer, independently, rediscovered, the, lines, and, began, to, systematically, study, and, measure, their, wavelengths, and, they, are, now, called, fraunhofer, lines, he, mapped, over, 570, lines, designating, the, most, prominent, with, the, letters, a, through, k, and, weaker, lines, with, other, letters, about, 45, years, later, gustav, kirchhoff, and, robert, bunsen, noticed, that, several, fraunhofer, lines, coincide, with, characteristic, emission, lines, identifies, in, the, spectra, of, heated, chemical, elements, they, inferred, that, dark, lines, in, the, solar, spectrum, are, caused, by, absorption, by, chemical, elements, in, the, solar, atmosphere, their, observations, were, in, the, visible, range, where, the, strongest, lines, come, from, metals, such, as, na, k, fe, in, the, early, work, on, the, chemical, composition, of, the, sun, the, only, elements, that, were, detected, in, spectra, were, hydrogen, and, various, metals, 23, 24, with, the, term, metallic, frequently, used, when, describing, them, part, 2, in, contemporary, usage, all, the, extra, elements, beyond, just, hydrogen, and, helium, are, termed, metallic, the, presence, of, heavier, elements, results, from, stellar, nucleosynthesis, where, the, majority, of, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, in, the, universe, metals, hereafter, are, formed, in, the, cores, of, stars, as, they, evolve, over, time, stellar, winds, and, supernovae, deposit, the, metals, into, the, surrounding, environment, enriching, the, interstellar, medium, and, providing, recycling, materials, for, the, birth, of, new, stars, it, follows, that, older, generations, of, stars, which, formed, in, the, metal, poor, early, universe, generally, have, lower, metallicities, than, those, of, younger, generations, which, formed, in, a, more, metal, rich, universe, observed, changes, in, the, chemical, abundances, of, different, types, of, stars, based, on, the, spectral, peculiarities, that, were, later, attributed, to, metallicity, led, astronomer, walter, baade, in, 1944, to, propose, the, existence, of, two, different, populations, of, stars, these, became, commonly, known, as, population, i, metal, rich, and, population, ii, metal, poor, stars, a, third, earliest, stellar, population, was, hypothesized, in, 1978, known, as, population, iii, stars, these, extremely, metal, poor, xmp, stars, are, theorized, to, have, been, the, first, born, stars, created, in, the, universe, astronomers, use, several, different, methods, to, describe, and, approximate, metal, abundances, depending, on, the, available, tools, and, the, object, of, interest, some, methods, include, determining, the, fraction, of, mass, that, is, attributed, to, gas, versus, metals, or, measuring, the, ratios, of, the, number, of, atoms, of, two, different, elements, as, compared, to, the, ratios, found, in, the, sun, stellar, composition, is, often, simply, defined, by, the, parameters, x, y, and, z, here, x, represents, the, mass, fraction, of, hydrogen, y, is, the, mass, fraction, of, helium, and, z, is, the, mass, fraction, of, all, the, remaining, chemical, elements, thus, x, y, z, 1, displaystyle, x, y, z, 1, in, most, stars, nebulae, h, ii, regions, and, other, astronomical, sources, hydrogen, and, helium, are, the, two, dominant, elements, the, hydrogen, mass, fraction, is, generally, expressed, as, x, m, h, m, displaystyle, x, equiv, tfrac, m, mathsf, h, m, where, m, is, the, total, mass, of, the, system, and, m, h, displaystyle, m, mathsf, h, is, the, mass, of, the, hydrogen, it, contains, similarly, the, helium, mass, fraction, is, denoted, as, y, m, h, e, m, displaystyle, y, equiv, tfrac, m, mathsf, he, m, the, remainder, of, the, elements, are, collectively, referred, to, as, metals, and, the, metallicity, the, mass, fraction, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, is, calculated, as, z, e, h, e, m, e, m, 1, x, y, displaystyle, z, sum, e, mathsf, he, tfrac, m, e, m, 1, x, y, for, the, surface, of, the, sun, symbol, displaystyle, odot, these, parameters, are, measured, to, have, the, following, values, due, to, the, effects, of, stellar, evolution, neither, the, initial, composition, nor, the, present, day, bulk, composition, of, the, sun, is, the, same, as, its, present, day, surface, composition, the, overall, stellar, metallicity, is, conventionally, defined, using, the, total, hydrogen, content, since, its, abundance, is, considered, to, be, relatively, constant, in, the, universe, or, the, iron, content, of, the, star, which, has, an, abundance, that, is, generally, linearly, increasing, in, time, in, the, universe, hence, iron, can, be, used, as, a, chronological, indicator, of, nucleosynthesis, iron, is, relatively, easy, to, measure, with, spectral, observations, in, the, star, s, spectrum, given, the, large, number, of, iron, lines, in, the, star, s, spectra, even, though, oxygen, is, the, most, abundant, heavy, element, see, metallicities, in, h, ii, regions, below, the, abundance, ratio, is, the, common, logarithm, of, the, ratio, of, a, star, s, iron, abundance, compared, to, that, of, the, sun, and, is, calculated, thus, f, e, h, log, 10, n, f, e, n, h, log, 10, n, f, e, n,

n, h, displaystyle, n, mathsf, h, are, the, number, of, iron, and, hydrogen, atoms, per, unit, of, volume, respectively, displaystyle, odot, is, the, standard, symbol, for, the, sun, and, displaystyle, star, for, a, star, often, omitted, below, the, unit, often, used, for, metallicity, is, the, dex, contraction, of, decimal, exponent, by, this, formulation, stars, with, a, higher, metallicity, than, the, sun, have, a, positive, common, logarithm, whereas, those, more, dominated, by, hydrogen, have, a, corresponding, negative, value, for, example, stars, with, a, f, e, h, displaystyle, bigl, star, value, of, 1, have, 10, times, the, metallicity, of, the, sun, 10, 1, conversely, those, with, a, f, e, h, displaystyle, bigl, star, value, of, 1, have, 1, 10, while, those, with, a, f, e, h, displaystyle, bigl, star, value, of, 0, have, the, same, metallicity, as, the, sun, and, so, on, young, population, i, stars, have, significantly, higher, iron, to, hydrogen, ratios, than, older, population, ii, stars, primordial, population, iii, stars, are, estimated, to, have, metallicity, less, than, 6, a, millionth, of, the, abundance, of, iron, in, the, sun, the, same, notation, is, used, to, express, variations, in, abundances, between, other, individual, elements, as, compared, to, solar, proportions, for, example, the, notation, o, f, e, displaystyle, bigl, represents, the, difference, in, the, logarithm, of, the, star, s, oxygen, abundance, versus, its, iron, content, compared, to, that, of, the, sun, in, general, a, given, stellar, nucleosynthetic, process, alters, the, proportions, of, only, a, few, elements, or, isotopes, so, a, star, or, gas, sample, with, certain, f, e, displaystyle, bigl, star, values, may, well, be, indicative, of, an, associated, studied, nuclear, process, astronomers, can, estimate, metallicities, through, measured, and, calibrated, systems, that, correlate, photometric, measurements, and, spectroscopic, measurements, see, also, spectrophotometry, for, example, the, johnson, uvb, filters, can, be, used, to, detect, an, ultraviolet, uv, excess, in, stars, where, a, smaller, uv, excess, indicates, a, larger, presence, of, metals, that, absorb, the, uv, radiation, thereby, making, the, star, appear, redder, the, uv, excess, u, b, is, defined, as, the, difference, between, a, star, s, u, and, b, band, magnitudes, compared, to, the, difference, between, u, and, b, band, magnitudes, of, metal, rich, stars, in, the, hyades, cluster, unfortunately, u, b, is, sensitive, to, both, metallicity, and, temperature, if, two, stars, are, equally, metal, rich, but, one, is, cooler, than, the, other, they, will, likely, have, different, u, b, values, see, also, blanketing, effect, to, help, mitigate, this, degeneracy, a, star, s, b, v, color, index, can, be, used, as, an, indicator, for, temperature, furthermore, the, uv, excess, and, b, v, index, can, be, corrected, to, relate, the, u, b, value, to, iron, abundances, other, photometric, systems, that, can, be, used, to, determine, metallicities, of, certain, astrophysical, objects, include, the, str, mgren, system, the, geneva, system, the, washington, system, and, the, ddo, system, at, a, given, mass, and, age, a, metal, poor, star, will, be, slightly, warmer, population, ii, stars, metallicities, are, roughly, 1, 1000, to, 1, 10, of, the, sun, s, f, e, h, 3, 0, 1, 0, displaystyle, left, bigl, 3, 0, 1, 0, right, but, the, group, appears, cooler, than, population, i, overall, as, heavy, population, ii, stars, have, long, since, died, above, 40, solar, masses, metallicity, influences, how, a, star, will, die, outside, the, pair, instability, window, lower, metallicity, stars, will, collapse, directly, to, a, black, hole, while, higher, metallicity, stars, undergo, a, type, ib, c, supernova, and, may, leave, a, neutron, star, a, star, s, metallicity, measurement, is, one, parameter, that, helps, determine, whether, a, star, may, have, a, giant, planet, as, there, is, a, direct, correlation, between, metallicity, and, the, presence, of, a, giant, planet, measurements, have, demonstrated, the, connection, between, a, star, s, metallicity, and, gas, giant, planets, like, jupiter, and, saturn, the, more, metals, in, a, star, and, thus, its, planetary, system, and, protoplanetary, disk, the, more, likely, the, system, may, have, gas, giant, planets, current, models, show, that, the, metallicity, along, with, the, correct, planetary, system, temperature, and, distance, from, the, star, are, key, to, planet, and, planetesimal, formation, for, two, stars, that, have, equal, age, and, mass, but, different, metallicity, the, less, metallic, star, is, bluer, among, stars, of, the, same, color, less, metallic, stars, emit, more, ultraviolet, radiation, the, sun, with, eight, planets, and, nine, consensus, dwarf, planets, is, used, as, the, reference, with, a, f, e, h, displaystyle, bigl, of, 0, 00, young, massive, and, hot, stars, typically, of, spectral, types, o, and, b, in, h, ii, regions, emit, uv, photons, that, ionize, ground, state, hydrogen, atoms, knocking, electrons, and, protons, free, this, process, is, known, as, photoionization, the, free, electrons, can, strike, other, atoms, nearby, exciting, bound, metallic, electrons, into, a, metastable, state, which, eventually, decay, back, into, a, ground, state, emitting, photons, with, energies, that, correspond, to, forbidden, lines, through, these, transitions, astronomers, have, developed, several, observational, methods, to, estimate, metal, abundances, in, h, ii, regions, where, the, stronger, the, forbidden, lines, in, spectroscopic, observations, the, higher, the, metallicity, these, methods, are, dependent, on, one, or, more, of, the, following, the, variety, of, asymmetrical, densities, inside, h, ii, regions, the, varied, temperatures, of, the, embedded, stars, and, or, the, electron, density, within, the, ionized, region, theoretically, to, determine, the, total, abundance, of, a, single, element, in, an, h, ii, region, all, transition, lines, should, be, observed, and, summed, however, this, can, be, observationally, difficult, due, to, variation, in, line, strength, some, of, the, most, common, forbidden, lines, used, to, determine, metal, abundances, in, h, ii, regions, are, from, oxygen, e, g, 3727, 7318, 7324, and, 4363, 4959, 5007, nitrogen, e, g, 5755, 6548, 6584, and, sulfur, e, g, 6717, 6731, and, 6312, 9069, 9531, in, the, optical, spectrum, and, the, 52, 88, m, and, 57, m, lines, in, the, infrared, spectrum, oxygen, has, some, of, the, stronger, more, abundant, lines, in, h, ii, regions, making, it, a, main, target, for, metallicity, estimates, within, these, objects, to, calculate, metal, abundances, in, h, ii, regions, using, oxygen, flux, measurements, astronomers, often, use, the, r, 23, method, in, which, r, 23, o, i, i, 3727, o, i, i, i, 4959, 5007, h, 4861, displaystyle, r, 23, frac, left, 3727, mathrm, aa, left, 4959, mathrm, aa, 5007, mathrm, aa, bigl, 4861, mathrm, aa, where, o, i, i, 3727, o, i, i, i, 4959, 5007, displaystyle, left, 3727, mathrm, aa, left, 4959, mathrm, aa, 5007, mathrm, aa, is, the, sum, of, the, fluxes, from, oxygen, emission, lines, measured, at, the, rest, frame, 3727, 4959, and, 5007, wavelengths, divided, by, the, flux, from, the, balmer, series, h, emission, line, at, the, rest, frame, 4861, wavelength, this, ratio, is, well, defined, through, models, and, observational, studies, but, caution, should, be, taken, as, the, ratio, is, often, degenerate, providing, both, a, low, and, high, metallicity, solution, which, can, be, broken, with, additional, line, measurements, similarly, other, strong, forbidden, line, ratios, can, be, used, e, g, for, sulfur, where, s, 23, s, i, i, 6716, 6731, s, i, i, i, 9069, 9532, h, 4861, displaystyle, s, 23, frac, left, 6716, mathrm, aa, 6731, mathrm, aa, left, 9069, mathrm,
