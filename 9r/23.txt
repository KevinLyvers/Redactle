https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour
an, hour, symbol, h, also, abbreviated, hr, is, a, unit, of, time, historically, reckoned, as, 1, 24, of, a, day, and, defined, contemporarily, as, exactly, 3, 600, seconds, si, there, are, 60, minutes, in, an, hour, and, 24, hours, in, a, day, the, hour, was, initially, established, in, the, ancient, near, east, as, a, variable, measure, of, 1, 12, of, the, night, or, daytime, such, seasonal, hours, also, known, as, temporal, hours, or, unequal, hours, varied, by, season, and, latitude, equal, hours, or, equinoctial, hours, were, taken, as, 1, 24, of, the, day, as, measured, from, noon, to, noon, the, minor, seasonal, variations, of, this, unit, were, eventually, smoothed, by, making, it, 1, 24, of, the, mean, solar, day, since, this, unit, was, not, constant, due, to, long, term, variations, in, the, earth, s, rotation, the, hour, was, finally, separated, from, the, earth, s, rotation, and, defined, in, terms, of, the, atomic, or, physical, second, in, the, modern, metric, system, hours, are, an, accepted, unit, of, time, defined, as, 3, 600, atomic, seconds, however, on, rare, occasions, an, hour, may, incorporate, a, positive, or, negative, leap, second, effectively, making, it, appear, to, last, 3, 599, or, 3, 601, seconds, in, order, to, keep, utc, within, 0, 9, seconds, of, ut1, the, latter, of, which, is, based, on, measurements, of, the, mean, solar, day, hour, is, a, development, of, the, anglo, norman, houre, and, middle, english, ure, first, attested, in, the, 13th, century, it, displaced, tide, t, d, time, and, stound, stund, span, of, time, the, anglo, norman, term, was, a, borrowing, of, old, french, ure, a, variant, of, ore, which, derived, from, latin, h, ra, and, greek, h, r, like, old, english, t, d, and, stund, h, r, was, originally, a, vaguer, word, for, any, span, of, time, including, seasons, and, years, its, proto, indo, european, root, has, been, reconstructed, as, yeh, year, summer, making, hour, distantly, cognate, with, year, the, time, of, day, is, typically, expressed, in, english, in, terms, of, hours, whole, hours, on, a, 12, hour, clock, are, expressed, using, the, contracted, phrase, o, clock, from, the, older, of, the, clock, 10, am, and, 10, pm, are, both, read, as, ten, o, clock, hours, on, a, 24, hour, clock, military, time, are, expressed, as, hundred, or, hundred, hours, 1000, is, read, ten, hundred, or, ten, hundred, hours, 10, pm, would, be, twenty, two, hundred, fifteen, and, thirty, minutes, past, the, hour, is, expressed, as, a, quarter, past, or, after, and, half, past, respectively, from, their, fraction, of, the, hour, fifteen, minutes, before, the, hour, may, be, expressed, as, a, quarter, to, of, till, or, before, the, hour, 9, 45, may, be, read, nine, forty, five, or, a, quarter, till, ten, in, ancient, egypt, the, flooding, of, the, nile, was, and, still, is, an, important, annual, event, crucial, for, agriculture, it, was, accompanied, by, the, rise, of, sirius, before, the, sunrise, and, the, appearance, of, 12, constellations, across, the, night, sky, to, which, the, egyptians, assigned, some, significance, influenced, by, this, the, egyptians, divided, the, night, into, 12, equal, intervals, these, were, seasonal, hours, shorter, in, the, summer, than, in, the, winter, subsequently, the, day, was, divided, into, intervals, as, well, which, eventually, became, more, important, than, the, nightly, intervals, these, subdivisions, of, a, day, spread, to, greece, and, later, to, rome, the, ancient, greeks, kept, time, differently, than, is, done, today, instead, of, dividing, the, time, between, one, midnight, and, the, next, into, 24, equal, hours, they, divided, the, time, from, sunrise, to, sunset, into, 12, seasonal, hours, their, actual, duration, depending, on, season, and, the, time, from, sunset, to, the, next, sunrise, again, in, 12, seasonal, hours, initially, only, the, day, was, divided, into, 12, seasonal, hours, and, the, night, into, three, or, four, night, watches, by, the, hellenistic, period, the, night, was, also, divided, into, 12, hours, the, day, and, night, was, probably, first, divided, into, 24, hours, by, hipparchus, of, nicaea, the, greek, astronomer, andronicus, of, cyrrhus, oversaw, the, construction, of, a, horologion, called, the, tower, of, the, winds, in, athens, during, the, first, century, bce, this, structure, tracked, a, 24, hour, day, using, both, sundials, and, mechanical, hour, indicators, the, canonical, hours, were, inherited, into, early, christianity, from, second, temple, judaism, by, ad, 60, the, didache, recommends, disciples, to, pray, the, lord, s, prayer, three, times, a, day, this, practice, found, its, way, into, the, canonical, hours, as, well, by, the, second, and, third, centuries, such, church, fathers, as, clement, of, alexandria, origen, and, tertullian, wrote, of, the, practice, of, morning, and, evening, prayer, and, of, the, prayers, at, the, third, sixth, and, ninth, hours, in, the, early, church, during, the, night, before, every, feast, a, vigil, was, kept, the, word, vigils, at, first, applied, to, the, night, office, comes, from, a, latin, source, namely, the, vigiliae, or, nocturnal, watches, or, guards, of, the, soldiers, the, night, from, six, o, clock, in, the, evening, to, six, o, clock, in, the, morning, was, divided, into, four, watches, or, vigils, of, three, hours, each, the, first, the, second, the, third, and, the, fourth, vigil, the, horae, were, originally, personifications, of, seasonal, aspects, of, nature, not, of, the, time, of, day, the, list, of, 12, horae, representing, the, 12, hours, of, the, day, is, recorded, only, in, late, antiquity, by, nonnus, the, first, and, twelfth, of, the, horae, were, added, to, the, original, set, of, ten, medieval, astronomers, such, as, al, biruni, and, sacrobosco, divided, the, hour, into, 60, minutes, each, of, 60, seconds, this, derives, from, babylonian, astronomy, where, the, corresponding, terms, denoted, the, time, required, for, the, sun, s, apparent, motion, through, the, ecliptic, to, describe, one, minute, or, second, of, arc, respectively, in, present, terms, the, babylonian, degree, of, time, was, thus, four, minutes, long, the, minute, of, time, was, thus, four, seconds, long, and, the, second, 1, 15, of, a, second, in, medieval, europe, the, roman, hours, continued, to, be, marked, on, sundials, but, the, more, important, units, of, time, were, the, canonical, hours, of, the, orthodox, and, catholic, church, during, daylight, these, followed, the, pattern, set, by, the, three, hour, bells, of, the, roman, markets, which, were, succeeded, by, the, bells, of, local, churches, they, rang, prime, at, about, 6, am, terce, at, about, 9, am, sext, at, noon, nones, at, about, 3, pm, and, vespers, at, either, 6, pm, or, sunset, matins, and, lauds, precede, these, irregularly, in, the, morning, hours, compline, follows, them, irregularly, before, sleep, and, the, midnight, office, follows, that, vatican, ii, ordered, their, reformation, for, the, catholic, church, in, 1963, though, they, continue, to, be, observed, in, the, orthodox, churches, when, mechanical, clocks, began, to, be, used, to, show, hours, of, daylight, or, nighttime, their, period, needed, to, be, changed, every, morning, and, evening, for, example, by, changing, the, length, of, their, pendula, the, use, of, 24, hours, for, the, entire, day, meant, hours, varied, much, less, and, the, clocks, needed, to, be, adjusted, only, a, few, times, a, month, the, minor, irregularities, of, the, apparent, solar, day, were, smoothed, by, measuring, time, using, the, mean, solar, day, using, the, sun, s, movement, along, the, celestial, equator, rather, than, along, the, ecliptic, the, irregularities, of, this, time, system, were, so, minor, that, most, clocks, reckoning, such, hours, did, not, need, adjustment, however, scientific, measurements, eventually, became, precise, enough, to, note, the, effect, of, tidal, deceleration, of, the, earth, by, the, moon, which, gradually, lengthens, the, earth, s, days, during, the, french, revolution, a, general, decimalisation, of, measures, was, enacted, including, decimal, time, between, 1794, and, 1800, under, its, provisions, the, french, hour, french, heure, was, 1, 10, of, the, day, and, divided, formally, into, 100, decimal, minutes, minute, d, cimale, and, informally, into, 10, tenths, d, cime, mandatory, use, for, all, public, records, began, in, 1794, but, was, suspended, six, months, later, by, the, same, 1795, legislation, that, first, established, the, metric, system, in, spite, of, this, a, few, localities, continued, to, use, decimal, time, for, six, years, for, civil, status, records, until, 1800, after, napoleon, s, coup, of, 18, brumaire, the, metric, system, bases, its, measurements, of, time, upon, the, second, defined, since, 1952, in, terms, of, the, earth, s, rotation, in, ad, 1900, its, hours, are, a, secondary, unit, computed, as, precisely, 3, 600, seconds, however, an, hour, of, coordinated, universal, time, utc, used, as, the, basis, of, most, civil, time, has, lasted, 3, 601, seconds, 27, times, since, 1972, in, order, to, keep, it, within, 0, 9, seconds, of, universal, time, which, is, based, on, measurements, of, the, mean, solar, day, at, 0, longitude, the, addition, of, these, seconds, accommodates, the, very, gradual, slowing, of, the, rotation, of, the, earth, in, modern, life, the, ubiquity, of, clocks, and, other, timekeeping, devices, means, that, segmentation, of, days, according, to, their, hours, is, commonplace, most, forms, of, employment, whether, wage, or, salaried, labour, involve, compensation, based, upon, measured, or, expected, hours, worked, the, fight, for, an, eight, hour, day, was, a, part, of, labour, movements, around, the, world, informal, rush, hours, and, happy, hours, cover, the, times, of, day, when, commuting, slows, down, due, to, congestion, or, alcoholic, drinks, being, available, at, discounted, prices, the, hour, record, for, the, greatest, distance, travelled, by, a, cyclist, within, the, span, of, an, hour, is, one, of, cycling, s, greatest, honours, many, different, ways, of, counting, the, hours, have, been, used, because, sunrise, sunset, and, to, a, lesser, extent, noon, are, the, conspicuous, points, in, the, day, starting, to, count, at, these, times, was, for, most, people, in, most, early, societies, much, easier, than, starting, at, midnight, however, with, accurate, clocks, and, modern, astronomical, equipment, and, the, telegraph, or, similar, means, to, transfer, a, time, signal, in, a, split, second, this, issue, is, much, less, relevant, astrolabes, sundials, and, astronomical, clocks, sometimes, show, the, hour, length, and, count, using, some, of, these, older, definitions, and, counting, methods, in, ancient, and, medieval, cultures, the, counting, of, hours, generally, started, with, sunrise, before, the, widespread, use, of, artificial, light, societies, were, more, concerned, with, the, division, between, night, and, day, and, daily, routines, often, began, when, light, was, sufficient, babylonian, hours, divide, the, day, and, night, into, 24, equal, hours, reckoned, from, the, time, of, sunrise, they, are, so, named, from, the, false, belief, of, ancient, authors, that, the, babylonians, divided, the, day, into, 24, parts, beginning, at, sunrise, in, fact, they, divided, the, day, into, 12, parts, called, kaspu, or, double, hours, or, into, 60, equal, parts, sunrise, marked, the, beginning, of, the, first, hour, the, middle, of, the, day, was, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, hour, and, sunset, at, the, end, of, the, twelfth, hour, this, meant, that, the, duration, of, hours, varied, with, the, season, in, the, northern, hemisphere, particularly, in, the, more, northerly, latitudes, summer, daytime, hours, were, longer, than, winter, daytime, hours, each, being, one, twelfth, of, the, time, between, sunrise, and, sunset, these, variable, length, hours, were, variously, known, as, temporal, unequal, or, seasonal, hours, and, were, in, use, until, the, appearance, of, the, mechanical, clock, which, furthered, the, adoption, of, equal, length, hours, this, is, also, the, system, used, in, jewish, law, and, frequently, called, talmudic, hour, sha, a, zemanit, in, a, variety, of, texts, the, talmudic, hour, is, one, twelfth, of, time, elapsed, from, sunrise, to, sunset, day, hours, therefore, being, longer, than, night, hours, in, the, summer, in, winter, they, reverse, the, indic, day, began, at, sunrise, the, term, hora, was, used, to, indicate, an, hour, the, time, was, measured, based, on, the, length, of, the, shadow, at, day, time, a, hora, translated, to, 2, 5, pe, there, are, 60, pe, per, day, 60, minutes, per, pe, and, 60, kshana, snap, of, a, finger, or, instant, per, minute, pe, was, measured, with, a, bowl, with, a, hole, placed, in, still, water, time, taken, for, this, graduated, bowl, was, one, pe, kings, usually, had, an, officer, in, charge, of, this, clock, in, so, called, italian, time, italian, hours, or, old, czech, time, the, first, hour, started, with, the, sunset, angelus, bell, or, at, the, end, of, dusk, i, e, half, an, hour, after, sunset, depending, on, local, custom, and, geographical, latitude, the, hours, were, numbered, from, 1, to, 24, for, example, in, lugano, the, sun, rose, in, december, during, the, 14th, hour, and, noon, was, during, the, 19th, hour, in, june, the, sun, rose, during, the, 7th, hour, and, noon, was, in, the, 15th, hour, sunset, was, always, at, the, end, of, the, 24th, hour, the, clocks, in, church, towers, struck, only, from, 1, to, 12, thus, only, during, night, or, early, morning, hours, this, manner, of, counting, hours, had, the, advantage, that, everyone, could, easily, know, how, much, time, they, had, to, finish, their, day, s, work, without, artificial, light, it, was, already, widely, used, in, italy, by, the, 14th, century, and, lasted, until, the, mid, 18th, century, it, was, officially, abolished, in, 1755, or, in, some, regions, customary, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, system, of, italian, hours, can, be, seen, on, a, number, of, clocks, in, europe, where, the, dial, is, numbered, from, 1, to, 24, in, either, roman, or, arabic, numerals, the, st, mark, s, clock, in, venice, and, the, orloj, in, prague, are, famous, examples, it, was, also, used, in, poland, silesia, and, bohemia, until, the, 17th, century, its, replacement, by, the, more, practical, division, into, twice, twelve, equinoctial, hours, also, called, small, clock, or, civic, hours, began, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, the, islamic, day, begins, at, sunset, the, first, prayer, of, the, day, maghrib, is, to, be, performed, between, just, after, sunset, and, the, end, of, twilight, until, 1968, saudi, arabia, used, the, system, of, counting, 24, equal, hours, with, the, first, hour, starting, at, sunset, for, many, centuries, up, to, 1925, astronomers, counted, the, hours, and, days, from, noon, because, it, was, the, easiest, solar, event, to, measure, accurately, an, advantage, of, this, method, used, in, the, julian, date, system, in, which, a, new, julian, day, begins, at, noon, is, that, the, date, doesn, t, change, during, a, single, night, s, observing, in, the, modern, 12, hour, clock, counting, the, hours, starts, at, midnight, and, restarts, at, noon, hours, are, numbered, 12, 1, 2, 11, solar, noon, is, always, close, to, 12, noon, ignoring, artificial, adjustments, due, to, time, zones, and, daylight, saving, time, differing, according, to, the, equation, of, time, by, as, much, as, fifteen, minutes, either, way, at, the, equinoxes, sunrise, is, around, 6, a, m, latin, ante, meridiem, before, noon, and, sunset, around, 6, p, m, latin, post, meridiem, after, noon, in, the, modern, 24, hour, clock, counting, the, hours, starts, at, midnight, and, hours, are, numbered, from, 0, to, 23, solar, noon, is, always, close, to, 12, 00, again, differing, according, to, the, equation, of, time, at, the, equinoxes, sunrise, is, around, 06, 00, and, sunset, around, 18, 00, the, ancient, egyptians, began, dividing, the, night, into, wnwt, at, some, time, before, the, compilation, of, the, dynasty, v, pyramid, texts, in, the, 24th, century, bc, by, 2150, bc, dynasty, ix, diagrams, of, stars, inside, egyptian, coffin, lids, variously, known, as, diagonal, calendars, or, star, clocks, attest, that, there, were, exactly, 12, of, these, clagett, writes, that, it, is, certain, this, duodecimal, division, of, the, night, followed, the, adoption, of, the, egyptian, civil, calendar, usually, placed, c, 2800, bc, on, the, basis, of, analyses, of, the, sothic, cycle, but, a, lunar, calendar, presumably, long, predated, this, and, also, would, have, had, 12, months, in, each, of, its, years, the, coffin, diagrams, show, that, the, egyptians, took, note, of, the, heliacal, risings, of, 36, stars, or, constellations, now, known, as, decans, one, for, each, of, the, ten, day, weeks, of, their, civil, calendar, 12, sets, of, alternate, triangle, decans, were, used, for, the, 5, epagomenal, days, between, years, each, night, the, rising, of, eleven, of, these, decans, were, noted, separating, the, night, into, 12, divisions, whose, middle, terms, would, have, lasted, about, 40, minutes, each, another, seven, stars, were, noted, by, the, egyptians, during, the, twilight, and, predawn, periods, although, they, were, not, important, for, the, hour, divisions, the, original, decans, used, by, the, egyptians, would, have, fallen, noticeably, out, of, their, proper, places, over, a, span, of, several, centuries, by, the, time, of, amenhotep, iii, c, 1350, bc, the, priests, at, karnak, were, using, water, clocks, to, determine, the, hours, these, were, filled, to, the, brim, at, sunset, and, the, hour, determined, by, comparing, the, water, level, against, one, of, its, 12, gauges, one, for, each, month, of, the, year, during, the, new, kingdom, another, system, of, decans, was, used, made, up, of, 24, stars, over, the, course, of, the, year, and, 12, within, any, one, night, the, later, division, of, the, day, into, 12, hours, was, accomplished, by, sundials, marked, with, ten, equal, divisions, the, morning, and, evening, periods, when, the, sundials, failed, to, note, time, were, observed, as, the, first, and, last, hours, the, egyptian, hours, were, closely, connected, both, with, the, priesthood, of, the, gods, and, with, their, divine, services, by, the, new, kingdom, each, hour, was, conceived, as, a, specific, region, of, the, sky, or, underworld, through, which, ra, s, solar, barge, travelled, protective, deities, were, assigned, to, each, and, were, used, as, the, names, of, the, hours, as, the, protectors, and, resurrectors, of, the, sun, the, goddesses, of, the, night, hours, were, considered, to, hold, power, over, all, lifespans, and, thus, became, part, of, egyptian, funerary, rituals, two, fire, spitting, cobras, were, said, to, guard, the, gates, of, each, hour, of, the, underworld, and, wadjet, and, the, rearing, cobra, uraeus, were, also, sometimes, referenced, as, wnwt, from, their, role, protecting, the, dead, through, these, gates, the, egyptian, word, for, astronomer, used, as, a, synonym, for, priest, was, wnwty, one, of, the, wnwt, as, it, were, one, of, the, hours, the, earliest, forms, of, wnwt, include, one, or, three, stars, with, the, later, solar, hours, including, the, determinative, hieroglyph, for, sun, ancient, china, divided, its, day, into, 100, marks, chinese, oc, k, k, p, k, running, from, midnight, to, midnight, the, system, is, said, to, have, been, used, since, remote, antiquity, credited, to, the, legendary, yellow, emperor, but, is, first, attested, in, han, era, water, clocks, and, in, the, 2nd, century, history, of, that, dynasty, it, was, measured, with, sundials, and, water, clocks, into, the, eastern, han, the, chinese, measured, their, day, schematically, adding, the, 20, ke, difference, between, the, solstices, evenly, throughout, the, year, one, every, nine, days, during, the, night, time, was, more, commonly, reckoned, during, the, night, by, the, watches, chinese, oc, k, p, g, ng, of, the, guard, which, were, reckoned, as, a, fifth, of, the, time, from, sunset, to, sunrise, imperial, china, continued, to, use, ke, and, geng, but, also, began, to, divide, the, day, into, 12, double, hours, t, s, oc, d, p, sh, lit, time, named, after, the, earthly, branches, and, sometimes, also, known, by, the, name, of, the, corresponding, animal, of, the, chinese, zodiac, the, first, shi, originally, ran, from, 11, pm, to, 1, am, but, was, reckoned, as, starting, at, midnight, by, the, time, of, the, history, of, song, compiled, during, the, early, yuan, these, apparently, began, to, be, used, during, the, eastern, han, that, preceded, the, three, kingdoms, era, but, the, sections, that, would, have, covered, them, are, missing, from, their, official, histories, they, first, appear, in, official, use, in, the, tang, era, book, of, sui, variations, of, all, these, units, were, subsequently, adopted, by, japan, and, the, other, countries, of, the, sinosphere, the, 12, shi, supposedly, began, to, be, divided, into, 24, hours, under, the, tang, although, they, are, first, attested, in, the, ming, era, book, of, yuan, in, that, work, the, hours, were, known, by, the, same, earthly, branches, as, the, shi, with, the, first, half, noted, as, its, starting, and, the, second, as, completed, or, proper, shi, in, modern, china, these, are, instead, simply, numbered, and, described, as, little, shi, the, modern, ke, is, now, used, to, count, quarter, hours, rather, than, a, separate, unit, as, with, the, egyptian, night, and, daytime, hours, the, division, of, the, day, into, 12, shi, has, been, credited, to, the, example, set, by, the, rough, number, of, lunar, cycles, in, a, solar, year, although, the, 12, year, jovian, orbital, cycle, was, more, important, to, traditional, chinese, and, babylonian, reckoning, of, the, zodiac, in, thailand, laos, and, cambodia, the, traditional, system, of, noting, hours, is, the, six, hour, clock, this, reckons, each, of, a, day, s, 24, hours, apart, from, noon, as, part, of, a, fourth, of, the, day, the, first, hour, of, the, first, half, of, daytime, was, 7, am, 1, pm, the, first, hour, of, the, latter, half, of, daytime, 7, pm, the, first, hour, of, the, first, half, of, nighttime, and, 1, am, the, first, hour, of, the, latter, half, of, nighttime, this, system, existed, in, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, deriving, its, current, phrasing, from, the, practice, of, publicly, announcing, the, daytime, hours, with, a, gong, and, the, nighttime, hours, with, a, drum, it, was, abolished, in, laos, and, cambodia, during, their, french, occupation, and, is, uncommon, there, now, the, thai, system, remains, in, informal, use, in, the, form, codified, in, 1901, by, king, chulalongkorn, the, vedas, and, puranas, employed, units, of, time, based, on, the, sidereal, day, nak, atra, ahor, tra, this, was, variously, divided, into, 30, muh, rta, s, of, 48, minutes, each, or, 60, dandas, or, nad, s, of, 24, minutes, each, the, solar, day, was, later, similarly, divided, into, 60, gha, ik, s, of, about, the, same, duration, each, divided, in, turn, into, 60, vinadis, the, sinhalese, followed, a, similar, system, but, called, their, sixtieth, of, a, day, a, peya
