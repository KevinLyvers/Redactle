polymer, chemistry, is, a, sub, discipline, of, chemistry, that, focuses, on, the, structures, of, chemicals, chemical, synthesis, and, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, polymers, and, macromolecules, the, principles, and, methods, used, within, polymer, chemistry, are, also, applicable, through, a, wide, range, of, other, chemistry, sub, disciplines, like, organic, chemistry, analytical, chemistry, and, physical, chemistry, many, materials, have, polymeric, structures, from, fully, inorganic, metals, and, ceramics, to, dna, and, other, biological, molecules, however, polymer, chemistry, is, typically, related, to, synthetic, and, organic, compositions, synthetic, polymers, are, ubiquitous, in, commercial, materials, and, products, in, everyday, use, such, as, plastics, and, rubbers, and, are, major, components, of, composite, materials, polymer, chemistry, can, also, be, included, in, the, broader, fields, of, polymer, science, or, even, nanotechnology, both, of, which, can, be, described, as, encompassing, polymer, physics, and, polymer, engineering, the, work, of, henri, braconnot, in, 1777, and, the, work, of, christian, sch, nbein, in, 1846, led, to, the, discovery, of, nitrocellulose, which, when, treated, with, camphor, produced, celluloid, dissolved, in, ether, or, acetone, it, becomes, collodion, which, has, been, used, as, a, wound, dressing, since, the, u, s, civil, war, cellulose, acetate, was, first, prepared, in, 1865, in, years, 1834, 1844, the, properties, of, rubber, polyisoprene, were, found, to, be, greatly, improved, by, heating, with, sulfur, thus, founding, the, vulcanization, process, in, 1884, hilaire, de, chardonnet, started, the, first, artificial, fiber, plant, based, on, regenerated, cellulose, or, viscose, rayon, as, a, substitute, for, silk, but, it, was, very, flammable, in, 1907, leo, baekeland, invented, the, first, polymer, made, independent, of, the, products, of, organisms, a, thermosetting, phenol, formaldehyde, resin, called, bakelite, around, the, same, time, hermann, leuchs, reported, the, synthesis, of, amino, acid, n, carboxyanhydrides, and, their, high, molecular, weight, products, upon, reaction, with, nucleophiles, but, stopped, short, of, referring, to, these, as, polymers, possibly, due, to, the, strong, views, espoused, by, emil, fischer, his, direct, supervisor, denying, the, possibility, of, any, covalent, molecule, exceeding, 6, 000, daltons, cellophane, was, invented, in, 1908, by, jocques, brandenberger, who, treated, sheets, of, viscose, rayon, with, acid, the, chemist, hermann, staudinger, first, proposed, that, polymers, consisted, of, long, chains, of, atoms, held, together, by, covalent, bonds, which, he, called, macromolecules, his, work, expanded, the, chemical, understanding, of, polymers, and, was, followed, by, an, expansion, of, the, field, of, polymer, chemistry, during, which, such, polymeric, materials, as, neoprene, nylon, and, polyester, were, invented, before, staudinger, polymers, were, thought, to, be, clusters, of, small, molecules, colloids, without, definite, molecular, weights, held, together, by, an, unknown, force, staudinger, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1953, wallace, carothers, invented, the, first, synthetic, rubber, called, neoprene, in, 1931, the, first, polyester, and, went, on, to, invent, nylon, a, true, silk, replacement, in, 1935, paul, flory, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1974, for, his, work, on, polymer, random, coil, configurations, in, solution, in, the, 1950s, stephanie, kwolek, developed, an, aramid, or, aromatic, nylon, named, kevlar, patented, in, 1966, karl, ziegler, and, giulio, natta, received, a, nobel, prize, for, their, discovery, of, catalysts, for, the, polymerization, of, alkenes, alan, j, heeger, alan, macdiarmid, and, hideki, shirakawa, were, awarded, the, 2000, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, the, development, of, polyacetylene, and, related, conductive, polymers, polyacetylene, itself, did, not, find, practical, applications, but, organic, light, emitting, diodes, oleds, emerged, as, one, application, of, conducting, polymers, teaching, and, research, programs, in, polymer, chemistry, were, introduced, in, the, 1940s, an, institute, for, macromolecular, chemistry, was, founded, in, 1940, in, freiburg, germany, under, the, direction, of, staudinger, in, america, a, polymer, research, institute, pri, was, established, in, 1941, by, herman, mark, at, the, polytechnic, institute, of, brooklyn, now, polytechnic, institute, of, nyu, polymers, are, high, molecular, mass, compounds, formed, by, polymerization, of, monomers, they, are, synthesized, by, the, polymerization, process, and, can, be, modified, by, the, additive, of, monomers, the, additives, of, monomers, change, polymers, mechanical, property, processability, durability, and, so, on, the, simple, reactive, molecule, from, which, the, repeating, structural, units, of, a, polymer, are, derived, is, called, a, monomer, a, polymer, can, be, described, in, many, ways, its, degree, of, polymerisation, molar, mass, distribution, tacticity, copolymer, distribution, the, degree, of, branching, by, its, end, groups, crosslinks, crystallinity, and, thermal, properties, such, as, its, glass, transition, temperature, and, melting, temperature, polymers, in, solution, have, special, characteristics, with, respect, to, solubility, viscosity, and, gelation, illustrative, of, the, quantitative, aspects, of, polymer, chemistry, particular, attention, is, paid, to, the, number, average, and, weight, average, molecular, weights, m, n, displaystyle, m, n, and, m, w, displaystyle, m, w, respectively, the, formation, and, properties, of, polymers, have, been, rationalized, by, many, theories, including, scheutjens, fleer, theory, flory, huggins, solution, theory, cossee, arlman, mechanism, polymer, field, theory, hoffman, nucleation, theory, flory, stockmayer, theory, and, many, others, the, study, of, polymer, thermodynamics, helps, improve, the, material, properties, of, various, polymer, based, materials, such, as, polystyrene, styrofoam, and, polycarbonate, common, improvements, include, toughening, improving, impact, resistance, improving, biodegradability, and, altering, a, material, s, solubility, as, polymers, get, longer, and, their, molecular, weight, increases, their, viscosity, tend, to, increase, thus, the, measured, viscosity, of, polymers, can, provide, valuable, information, about, the, average, length, of, the, polymer, the, progress, of, reactions, and, in, what, ways, the, polymer, branches, polymers, can, be, classified, in, many, ways, polymers, strictly, speaking, comprise, most, solid, matter, minerals, i, e, most, of, the, earth, s, crust, are, largely, polymers, metals, are, 3, d, polymers, organisms, living, and, dead, are, composed, largely, of, polymers, and, water, often, polymers, are, classified, according, to, their, origin, biopolymers, are, the, structural, and, functional, materials, that, comprise, most, of, the, organic, matter, in, organisms, one, major, class, of, biopolymers, are, proteins, which, are, derived, from, amino, acids, polysaccharides, such, as, cellulose, chitin, and, starch, are, biopolymers, derived, from, sugars, the, poly, nucleic, acids, dna, and, rna, are, derived, from, phosphorylated, sugars, with, pendant, nucleotides, that, carry, genetic, information, synthetic, polymers, are, the, structural, materials, manifested, in, plastics, synthetic, fibers, paints, building, materials, furniture, mechanical, parts, and, adhesives, synthetic, polymers, may, be, divided, into, thermoplastic, polymers, and, thermoset, plastics, thermoplastic, polymers, include, polyethylene, teflon, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyester, polyurethane, poly, methyl, methacrylate, polyvinyl, chloride, nylons, and, rayon, thermoset, plastics, include, vulcanized, rubber, bakelite, kevlar, and, polyepoxide, almost, all, synthetic, polymers, are, derived, from, petrochemicals
