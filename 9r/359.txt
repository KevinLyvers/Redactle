silicon, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, si, and, atomic, number, 14, it, is, a, hard, brittle, crystalline, solid, with, a, blue, grey, metallic, luster, and, is, a, tetravalent, metalloid, and, semiconductor, it, is, a, member, of, group, 14, in, the, periodic, table, carbon, is, above, it, and, germanium, tin, lead, and, flerovium, are, below, it, it, is, relatively, unreactive, silicon, is, a, significant, element, that, is, essential, for, several, physiological, and, metabolic, processes, in, plants, silicon, is, widely, regarded, as, the, predominant, semiconductor, material, due, to, its, versatile, applications, in, various, electrical, devices, such, as, transistors, solar, cells, integrated, circuits, and, others, these, may, be, due, to, its, significant, band, gap, expansive, optical, transmission, range, extensive, absorption, spectrum, surface, roughening, and, effective, anti, reflection, coating, because, of, its, high, chemical, affinity, for, oxygen, it, was, not, until, 1823, that, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, was, first, able, to, prepare, it, and, characterize, it, in, pure, form, its, oxides, form, a, family, of, anions, known, as, silicates, its, melting, and, boiling, points, of, 1414, c, and, 3265, c, respectively, are, the, second, highest, among, all, the, metalloids, and, nonmetals, being, surpassed, only, by, boron, silicon, is, the, eighth, most, common, element, in, the, universe, by, mass, but, very, rarely, occurs, as, the, pure, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, is, widely, distributed, throughout, space, in, cosmic, dusts, planetoids, and, planets, as, various, forms, of, silicon, dioxide, silica, or, silicates, more, than, 90, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, composed, of, silicate, minerals, making, silicon, the, second, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, about, 28, by, mass, after, oxygen, most, silicon, is, used, commercially, without, being, separated, often, with, very, little, processing, of, the, natural, minerals, such, use, includes, industrial, construction, with, clays, silica, sand, and, stone, silicates, are, used, in, portland, cement, for, mortar, and, stucco, and, mixed, with, silica, sand, and, gravel, to, make, concrete, for, walkways, foundations, and, roads, they, are, also, used, in, whiteware, ceramics, such, as, porcelain, and, in, traditional, silicate, based, soda, lime, glass, and, many, other, specialty, glasses, silicon, compounds, such, as, silicon, carbide, are, used, as, abrasives, and, components, of, high, strength, ceramics, silicon, is, the, basis, of, the, widely, used, synthetic, polymers, called, silicones, the, late, 20th, century, to, early, 21st, century, has, been, described, as, the, silicon, age, also, known, as, the, digital, age, or, information, age, because, of, the, large, impact, that, elemental, silicon, has, on, the, modern, world, economy, the, small, portion, of, very, highly, purified, elemental, silicon, used, in, semiconductor, electronics, 15, is, essential, to, the, transistors, and, integrated, circuit, chips, used, in, most, modern, technology, such, as, smartphones, and, other, computers, in, 2019, 32, 4, of, the, semiconductor, market, segment, was, for, networks, and, communications, devices, and, the, semiconductors, industry, is, projected, to, reach, 726, 73, billion, by, 2027, silicon, is, an, essential, element, in, biology, only, traces, are, required, by, most, animals, but, some, sea, sponges, and, microorganisms, such, as, diatoms, and, radiolaria, secrete, skeletal, structures, made, of, silica, silica, is, deposited, in, many, plant, tissues, owing, to, the, abundance, of, silicon, in, the, earth, s, crust, natural, silicon, based, materials, have, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, silicon, rock, crystals, were, familiar, to, various, ancient, civilizations, such, as, the, predynastic, egyptians, who, used, it, for, beads, and, small, vases, as, well, as, the, ancient, chinese, glass, containing, silica, was, manufactured, by, the, egyptians, since, at, least, 1500, bc, as, well, as, by, the, ancient, phoenicians, natural, silicate, compounds, were, also, used, in, various, types, of, mortar, for, construction, of, early, human, dwellings, in, 1787, antoine, lavoisier, suspected, that, silica, might, be, an, oxide, of, a, fundamental, chemical, element, but, the, chemical, affinity, of, silicon, for, oxygen, is, high, enough, that, he, had, no, means, to, reduce, the, oxide, and, isolate, the, element, after, an, attempt, to, isolate, silicon, in, 1808, sir, humphry, davy, proposed, the, name, silicium, for, silicon, from, the, latin, silex, silicis, for, flint, and, adding, the, ium, ending, because, he, believed, it, to, be, a, metal, most, other, languages, use, transliterated, forms, of, davy, s, name, sometimes, adapted, to, local, phonology, e, g, german, silizium, turkish, silisyum, catalan, silici, armenian, or, silitzioum, a, few, others, use, instead, a, calque, of, the, latin, root, e, g, russian, from, flint, greek, from, fire, finnish, pii, from, piikivi, flint, czech, k, em, k, from, k, emen, quartz, flint, gay, lussac, and, th, nard, are, thought, to, have, prepared, impure, amorphous, silicon, in, 1811, through, the, heating, of, recently, isolated, potassium, metal, with, silicon, tetrafluoride, but, they, did, not, purify, and, characterize, the, product, nor, identify, it, as, a, new, element, silicon, was, given, its, present, name, in, 1817, by, scottish, chemist, thomas, thomson, he, retained, part, of, davy, s, name, but, added, on, because, he, believed, that, silicon, was, a, nonmetal, similar, to, boron, and, carbon, in, 1824, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, prepared, amorphous, silicon, using, approximately, the, same, method, as, gay, lussac, reducing, potassium, fluorosilicate, with, molten, potassium, metal, but, purifying, the, product, to, a, brown, powder, by, repeatedly, washing, it, as, a, result, he, is, usually, given, credit, for, the, element, s, discovery, the, same, year, berzelius, became, the, first, to, prepare, silicon, tetrachloride, silicon, tetrafluoride, had, already, been, prepared, long, before, in, 1771, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, by, dissolving, silica, in, hydrofluoric, acid, in, 1823, for, the, first, time, jacob, berzelius, discovered, silicon, tetrachloride, sicl, 4, in, 1846, von, ebelman, s, synthesized, tetraethyl, orthosilicate, si, oc, 2, h, 5, 4, silicon, in, its, more, common, crystalline, form, was, not, prepared, until, 31, years, later, by, deville, by, electrolyzing, a, mixture, of, sodium, chloride, and, aluminium, chloride, containing, approximately, 10, silicon, he, was, able, to, obtain, a, slightly, impure, allotrope, of, silicon, in, 1854, later, more, cost, effective, methods, have, been, developed, to, isolate, several, allotrope, forms, the, most, recent, being, silicene, in, 2010, meanwhile, research, on, the, chemistry, of, silicon, continued, friedrich, w, hler, discovered, the, first, volatile, hydrides, of, silicon, synthesising, trichlorosilane, in, 1857, and, silane, itself, in, 1858, but, a, detailed, investigation, of, the, silanes, was, only, carried, out, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, alfred, stock, despite, early, speculation, on, the, matter, dating, as, far, back, as, the, beginnings, of, synthetic, organic, chemistry, in, the, 1830s, similarly, the, first, organosilicon, compound, tetraethylsilane, was, synthesised, by, charles, friedel, and, james, crafts, in, 1863, but, detailed, characterisation, of, organosilicon, chemistry, was, only, done, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, frederic, kipping, starting, in, the, 1920s, the, work, of, william, lawrence, bragg, on, x, ray, crystallography, elucidated, the, compositions, of, the, silicates, which, had, previously, been, known, from, analytical, chemistry, but, had, not, yet, been, understood, together, with, linus, pauling, s, development, of, crystal, chemistry, and, victor, goldschmidt, s, development, of, geochemistry, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, development, of, the, chemistry, and, industrial, use, of, siloxanes, and, the, growing, use, of, silicone, polymers, elastomers, and, resins, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, complexity, of, the, crystal, chemistry, of, silicides, was, mapped, along, with, the, solid, state, physics, of, doped, semiconductors, the, first, semiconductor, devices, did, not, use, silicon, but, used, galena, including, german, physicist, ferdinand, braun, s, crystal, detector, in, 1874, and, indian, physicist, jagadish, chandra, bose, s, radio, crystal, detector, in, 1901, the, first, silicon, semiconductor, device, was, a, silicon, radio, crystal, detector, developed, by, american, engineer, greenleaf, whittier, pickard, in, 1906, in, 1940, russell, ohl, discovered, the, p, n, junction, and, photovoltaic, effects, in, silicon, in, 1941, techniques, for, producing, high, purity, germanium, and, silicon, crystals, were, developed, for, radar, microwave, detector, crystals, during, world, war, ii, in, 1947, physicist, william, shockley, theorized, a, field, effect, amplifier, made, from, germanium, and, silicon, but, he, failed, to, build, a, working, device, before, eventually, working, with, germanium, instead, the, first, working, transistor, was, a, point, contact, transistor, built, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, later, that, year, while, working, under, shockley, in, 1954, physical, chemist, morris, tanenbaum, fabricated, the, first, silicon, junction, transistor, at, bell, labs, in, 1955, carl, frosch, and, lincoln, derick, at, bell, labs, accidentally, discovered, that, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, could, be, grown, on, silicon, and, they, later, proposed, this, could, mask, silicon, surfaces, during, diffusion, processes, in, 1958, the, silicon, age, refers, to, the, late, 20th, century, to, early, 21st, century, this, is, due, to, silicon, being, the, dominant, material, of, the, silicon, age, also, known, as, the, digital, age, or, information, age, similar, to, how, the, stone, age, bronze, age, and, iron, age, were, defined, by, the, dominant, materials, during, their, respective, ages, of, civilization, because, silicon, is, an, important, element, in, high, technology, semiconductor, devices, many, places, in, the, world, bear, its, name, for, example, the, santa, clara, valley, in, california, acquired, the, nickname, silicon, valley, as, the, element, is, the, base, material, in, the, semiconductor, industry, there, since, then, many, other, places, have, been, similarly, dubbed, including, silicon, wadi, in, israel, silicon, forest, in, oregon, silicon, hills, in, austin, texas, silicon, slopes, in, salt, lake, city, utah, silicon, saxony, in, germany, silicon, valley, in, india, silicon, border, in, mexicali, mexico, silicon, fen, in, cambridge, england, silicon, roundabout, in, london, silicon, glen, in, scotland, silicon, gorge, in, bristol, england, silicon, alley, in, new, york, city, and, silicon, beach, in, los, angeles, a, silicon, atom, has, fourteen, electrons, in, the, ground, state, they, are, arranged, in, the, electron, configuration, 3s, 2, 3p, 2, of, these, four, are, valence, electrons, occupying, the, 3s, orbital, and, two, of, the, 3p, orbitals, like, the, other, members, of, its, group, the, lighter, carbon, and, the, heavier, germanium, tin, and, lead, it, has, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, as, valence, orbitals, hence, it, can, complete, its, octet, and, obtain, the, stable, noble, gas, configuration, of, argon, by, forming, sp, 3, hybrid, orbitals, forming, tetrahedral, six, 4, derivatives, where, the, central, silicon, atom, shares, an, electron, pair, with, each, of, the, four, atoms, it, is, bonded, to, the, first, four, ionisation, energies, of, silicon, are, 786, 3, 1576, 5, 3228, 3, and, 4354, 4, kj, mol, respectively, these, figures, are, high, enough, to, preclude, the, possibility, of, simple, cationic, chemistry, for, the, element, following, periodic, trends, its, single, bond, covalent, radius, of, 117, 6, pm, is, intermediate, between, those, of, carbon, 77, 2, pm, and, germanium, 122, 3, pm, the, hexacoordinate, ionic, radius, of, silicon, may, be, considered, to, be, 40, pm, although, this, must, be, taken, as, a, purely, notional, figure, given, the, lack, of, a, simple, si, 4, cation, in, reality, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, silicon, is, a, shiny, semiconductor, with, a, bluish, grey, metallic, lustre, as, typical, for, semiconductors, its, resistivity, drops, as, temperature, rises, this, arises, because, silicon, has, a, small, energy, gap, band, gap, between, its, highest, occupied, energy, levels, the, valence, band, and, the, lowest, unoccupied, ones, the, conduction, band, the, fermi, level, is, about, halfway, between, the, valence, and, conduction, bands, and, is, the, energy, at, which, a, state, is, as, likely, to, be, occupied, by, an, electron, as, not, hence, pure, silicon, is, effectively, an, insulator, at, room, temperature, however, doping, silicon, with, a, pnictogen, such, as, phosphorus, arsenic, or, antimony, introduces, one, extra, electron, per, dopant, and, these, may, then, be, excited, into, the, conduction, band, either, thermally, or, photolytically, creating, an, n, type, semiconductor, similarly, doping, silicon, with, a, group, 13, element, such, as, boron, aluminium, or, gallium, results, in, the, introduction, of, acceptor, levels, that, trap, electrons, that, may, be, excited, from, the, filled, valence, band, creating, a, p, type, semiconductor, joining, n, type, silicon, to, p, type, silicon, creates, a, p, n, junction, with, a, common, fermi, level, electrons, flow, from, n, to, p, while, holes, flow, from, p, to, n, creating, a, voltage, drop, this, p, n, junction, thus, acts, as, a, diode, that, can, rectify, alternating, current, that, allows, current, to, pass, more, easily, one, way, than, the, other, a, transistor, is, an, n, p, n, junction, with, a, thin, layer, of, weakly, p, type, silicon, between, two, n, type, regions, biasing, the, emitter, through, a, small, forward, voltage, and, the, collector, through, a, large, reverse, voltage, allows, the, transistor, to, act, as, a, triode, amplifier, silicon, crystallises, in, a, giant, covalent, structure, at, standard, conditions, specifically, in, a, diamond, cubic, crystal, lattice, space, group, 227, it, thus, has, a, high, melting, point, of, 1414, c, as, a, lot, of, energy, is, required, to, break, the, strong, covalent, bonds, and, melt, the, solid, upon, melting, silicon, contracts, as, the, long, range, tetrahedral, network, of, bonds, breaks, up, and, the, voids, in, that, network, are, filled, in, similar, to, water, ice, when, hydrogen, bonds, are, broken, upon, melting, it, does, not, have, any, thermodynamically, stable, allotropes, at, standard, pressure, but, several, other, crystal, structures, are, known, at, higher, pressures, the, general, trend, is, one, of, increasing, coordination, number, with, pressure, culminating, in, a, hexagonal, close, packed, allotrope, at, about, 40, gigapascals, known, as, si, vii, the, standard, modification, being, si, i, an, allotrope, called, bc8, or, bc8, having, a, body, centred, cubic, lattice, with, eight, atoms, per, primitive, unit, cell, space, group, 206, can, be, created, at, high, pressure, and, remains, metastable, at, low, pressure, its, properties, have, been, studied, in, detail, silicon, boils, at, 3265, c, this, while, high, is, still, lower, than, the, temperature, at, which, its, lighter, congener, carbon, sublimes, 3642, c, and, silicon, similarly, has, a, lower, heat, of, vaporisation, than, carbon, consistent, with, the, fact, that, the, si, si, bond, is, weaker, than, the, c, c, bond, it, is, also, possible, to, construct, silicene, layers, analogous, to, graphene, naturally, occurring, silicon, is, composed, of, three, stable, isotopes, 28, si, 92, 23, 29, si, 4, 67, and, 30, si, 3, 10, out, of, these, only, 29, si, is, of, use, in, nmr, and, epr, spectroscopy, as, it, is, the, only, one, with, a, nuclear, spin, i, 1, 2, all, three, are, produced, in, type, ia, supernovae, through, the, oxygen, burning, process, with, 28, si, being, made, as, part, of, the, alpha, process, and, hence, the, most, abundant, the, fusion, of, 28, si, with, alpha, particles, by, photodisintegration, rearrangement, in, stars, is, known, as, the, silicon, burning, process, it, is, the, last, stage, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, before, the, rapid, collapse, and, violent, explosion, of, the, star, in, question, in, a, type, ii, supernova, twenty, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, the, two, stablest, being, 32, si, with, a, half, life, of, about, 150, years, and, 31, si, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 62, hours, all, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, seven, seconds, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, one, tenth, of, a, second, silicon, has, one, known, nuclear, isomer, 34m, si, with, a, half, life, less, than, 210, nanoseconds, 32, si, undergoes, low, energy, beta, decay, to, 32, p, and, then, stable, 32, s, 31, si, may, be, produced, by, the, neutron, activation, of, natural, silicon, and, is, thus, useful, for, quantitative, analysis, it, can, be, easily, detected, by, its, characteristic, beta, decay, to, stable, 31, p, in, which, the, emitted, electron, carries, up, to, 1, 48, mev, of, energy, the, known, isotopes, of, silicon, range, in, mass, number, from, 22, to, 44, the, most, common, decay, mode, of, the, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, lower, than, the, three, stable, isotopes, is, inverse, beta, decay, primarily, forming, aluminium, isotopes, 13, protons, as, decay, products, the, most, common, decay, mode, for, the, heavier, unstable, isotopes, is, beta, decay, primarily, forming, phosphorus, isotopes, 15, protons, as, decay, products, silicon, can, enter, the, oceans, through, groundwater, and, riverine, transport, large, fluxes, of, groundwater, input, have, an, isotopic, composition, which, is, distinct, from, riverine, silicon, inputs, isotopic, variations, in, groundwater, and, riverine, transports, contribute, to, variations, in, oceanic, 30, si, values, currently, there, are, substantial, differences, in, the, isotopic, values, of, deep, water, in, the, world, s, ocean, basins, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, there, is, a, deep, water, 30, si, gradient, of, greater, than, 0, 3, parts, per, thousand, 30, si, is, most, commonly, associated, with, productivity, in, the, oceans, crystalline, bulk, silicon, is, rather, inert, but, becomes, more, reactive, at, high, temperatures, like, its, neighbour, aluminium, silicon, forms, a, thin, continuous, surface, layer, of, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, that, protects, the, metal, from, oxidation, thus, silicon, does, not, measurably, react, with, the, air, below, 900, c, but, formation, of, the, vitreous, dioxide, rapidly, increases, between, 950, c, and, 1160, c, and, when, 1400, c, is, reached, atmospheric, nitrogen, also, reacts, to, give, the, nitrides, sin, and, si, 3, n, 4, silicon, reacts, with, gaseous, sulfur, at, 600, c, and, gaseous, phosphorus, at, 1000, c, this, oxide, layer, nevertheless, does, not, prevent, reaction, with, the, halogens, fluorine, attacks, silicon, vigorously, at, room, temperature, chlorine, does, so, at, about, 300, c, and, bromine, and, iodine, at, about, 500, c, silicon, does, not, react, with, most, aqueous, acids, but, is, oxidised, and, complexed, by, hydrofluoric, acid, mixtures, containing, either, chlorine, or, nitric, acid, to, form, hexafluorosilicates, it, readily, dissolves, in, hot, aqueous, alkali, to, form, silicates, at, high, temperatures, silicon, also, reacts, with, alkyl, halides, this, reaction, may, be, catalysed, by, copper, to, directly, synthesise, organosilicon, chlorides, as, precursors, to, silicone, polymers, upon, melting, silicon, becomes, extremely, reactive, alloying, with, most, metals, to, form, silicides, and, reducing, most, metal, oxides, because, the, heat, of, formation, of, silicon, dioxide, is, so, large, in, fact, molten, silicon, reacts, virtually, with, every, known, kind, of, crucible, material, except, its, own, oxide, sio, 2, 13, this, happens, due, to, silicon, s, high, binding, forces, for, the, light, elements, and, to, its, high, dissolving, power, for, most, elements, 13, as, a, result, containers, for, liquid, silicon, must, be, made, of, refractory, unreactive, materials, such, as, zirconium, dioxide, or, group, 4, 5, and, 6, borides, tetrahedral, coordination, is, a, major, structural, motif, in, silicon, chemistry, just, as, it, is, for, carbon, chemistry, however, the, 3p, subshell, is, rather, more, diffuse, than, the, 2p, subshell, and, does, not, hybridise, so, well, with, the, 3s, subshell, as, a, result, the, chemistry, of, silicon, and, its, heavier, congeners, shows, significant, differences, from, that, of, carbon, and, thus, octahedral, coordination, is, also, significant, for, example, the, electronegativity, of, silicon, 1, 90, is, much, less, than, that, of, carbon, 2, 55, because, the, valence, electrons, of, silicon, are, further, from, the, nucleus, than, those, of, carbon, and, hence, experience, smaller, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, from, the, nucleus, the, poor, overlap, of, 3p, orbitals, also, results, in, a, much, lower, tendency, toward, catenation, formation, of, si, si, bonds, for, silicon, than, for, carbon, due, to, the, concomitant, weakening, of, the, si, si, bond, compared, to, the, c, c, bond, the, average, si, si, bond, energy, is, approximately, 226, kj, mol, compared, to, a, value, of, 356, kj, mol, for, the, c, c, bond, this, results, in, multiply, bonded, silicon, compounds, generally, being, much, less, stable, than, their, carbon, counterparts, an, example, of, the, double, bond, rule, on, the, other, hand, the, presence, of, radial, nodes, in, the, 3p, orbitals, of, silicon, suggests, the, possibility, of, hypervalence, as, seen, in, five, and, six, coordinate, derivatives, of, silicon, such, as, six, 5, and, sif, 2, 6, lastly, because, of, the, increasing, energy, gap, between, the, valence, s, and, p, orbitals, as, the, group, is, descended, the, divalent, state, grows, in, importance, from, carbon, to, lead, so, that, a, few, unstable, divalent, compounds, are, known, for, silicon, this, lowering, of, the, main, oxidation, state, in, tandem, with, increasing, atomic, radii, results, in, an, increase, of, metallic, character, down, the, group, silicon, already, shows, some, incipient, metallic, behavior, particularly, in, the, behavior, of, its, oxide, compounds, and, its, reaction, with, acids, as, well, as, bases, though, this, takes, some, effort, and, is, hence, often, referred, to, as, a, metalloid, rather, than, a, nonmetal, germanium, shows, more, and, tin, is, generally, considered, a, metal, silicon, shows, clear, differences, from, carbon, for, example, organic, chemistry, has, very, few, analogies, with, silicon, chemistry, while, silicate, minerals, have, a, structural, complexity, unseen, in, oxocarbons, silicon, tends, to, resemble, germanium, far, more, than, it, does, carbon, and, this, resemblance, is, enhanced, by, the, d, block, contraction, resulting, in, the, size, of, the, germanium, atom, being, much, closer, to, that, of, the, silicon, atom, than, periodic, trends, would, predict, nevertheless, there, are, still, some, differences, because, of, the, growing, importance, of, the, divalent, state, in, germanium, compared, to, silicon, additionally, the, lower, ge, o, bond, strength, compared, to, the, si, o, bond, strength, results, in, the, absence, of, germanone, polymers, that, would, be, analogous, to, silicone, polymers, silicon, is, the, eighth, most, abundant, element, in, the, universe, coming, after, hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, and, neon, these, abundances, are, not, replicated, well, on, earth, due, to, substantial, separation, of, the, elements, taking, place, during, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, silicon, makes, up, 27, 2, of, the, earth, s, crust, by, weight, second, only, to, oxygen, at, 45, 5, with, which, it, always, is, associated, in, nature, further, fractionation, took, place, in, the, formation, of, the, earth, by, planetary, differentiation, earth, s, core, which, makes, up, 31, 5, of, the, mass, of, the, earth, has, approximate, composition, fe, 25, ni, 2, co, 0, 1, s, 3, the, mantle, makes, up, 68, 1, of, the, earth, s, mass, and, is, composed, mostly, of, denser, oxides, and, silicates, an, example, being, olivine, mg, fe, 2, sio, 4, while, the, lighter, siliceous, minerals, such, as, aluminosilicates, rise, to, the, surface, and, form, the, crust, making, up, 0, 4, of, the, earth, s, mass, the, crystallisation, of, igneous, rocks, from, magma, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, among, them, are, the, chemical, composition, of, the, magma, the, cooling, rate, and, some, properties, of, the, individual, minerals, to, be, formed, such, as, lattice, energy, melting, point, and, complexity, of, their, crystal, structure, as, magma, is, cooled, olivine, appears, first, followed, by, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite, mica, orthoclase, feldspar, muscovite, mica, quartz, zeolites, and, finally, hydrothermal, minerals, this, sequence, shows, a, trend, toward, increasingly, complex, silicate, units, with, cooling, and, the, introduction, of, hydroxide, and, fluoride, anions, in, addition, to, oxides, many, metals, may, substitute, for, silicon, after, these, igneous, rocks, undergo, weathering, transport, and, deposition, sedimentary, rocks, like, clay, shale, and, sandstone, are, formed, metamorphism, also, may, occur, at, high, temperatures, and, pressures, creating, an, even, vaster, variety, of, minerals, there, are, four, sources, for, silicon, fluxes, into, the, ocean, chemical, weathering, of, continental, rocks, river, transport, dissolution, of, continental, terrigenous, silicates, and, the, reaction, between, submarine, basalts, and, hydrothermal, fluid, which, release, dissolved, silicon, all, four, of, these, fluxes, are, interconnected, in, the, ocean, s, biogeochemical, cycle, as, they, all, were, initially, formed, from, the, weathering, of, earth, s, crust, approximately, 300, 900, megatonnes, of, aeolian, dust, is, deposited, into, the, world, s, oceans, each, year, of, that, value, 80, 240, megatonnes, are, in, the, form, of, particulate, silicon, the, total, amount, of, particulate, silicon, deposition, into, the, ocean, is, still, less, than, the, amount, of, silicon, influx, into, the, ocean, via, riverine, transportation, aeolian, inputs, of, particulate, lithogenic, silicon, into, the, north, atlantic, and, western, north, pacific, oceans, are, the, result, of, dust, settling, on, the, oceans, from, the, sahara, and, gobi, desert, respectively, riverine, transports, are, the, major, source, of, silicon, influx, into, the, ocean, in, coastal, regions, while, silicon, deposition, in, the, open, ocean, is, greatly, influenced, by, the, settling, of, aeolian, dust, silicon, of, 96, 99, purity, is, made, by, carbothermically, reducing, quartzite, or, sand, with, highly, pure, coke, the, reduction, is, carried, out, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, with, an, excess, of, sio, 2, used, to, stop, silicon, carbide, sic, from, accumulating, this, reaction, known, as, carbothermal, reduction, of, silicon, dioxide, usually, is, conducted, in, the, presence, of, scrap, iron, with, low, amounts, of, phosphorus, and, sulfur, producing, ferrosilicon, ferrosilicon, an, iron, silicon, alloy, that, contains, varying, ratios, of, elemental, silicon, and, iron, accounts, for, about, 80, of, the, world, s, production, of, elemental, silicon, with, china, the, leading, supplier, of, elemental, silicon, providing, 4, 6, million, tonnes, or, 2, 3rds, of, world, output, of, silicon, most, of, it, in, the, form, of, ferrosilicon, it, is, followed, by, russia, 610, 000, t, norway, 330, 000, t, brazil, 240, 000, t, and, the, united, states, 170, 000, t, ferrosilicon, is, primarily, used, by, the, iron, and, steel, industry, see, below, with, primary, use, as, alloying, addition, in, iron, or, steel, and, for, de, oxidation, of, steel, in, integrated, steel, plants, another, reaction, sometimes, used, is, aluminothermal, reduction, of, silicon, dioxide, as, follows, leaching, powdered, 96, 97, pure, silicon, with, water, results, in, 98, 5, pure, silicon, which, is, used, in, the, chemical, industry, however, even, greater, purity, is, needed, for, semiconductor, applications, and, this, is, produced, from, the, reduction, of, tetrachlorosilane, silicon, tetrachloride, or, trichlorosilane, the, former, is, made, by, chlorinating, scrap, silicon, and, the, latter, is, a, byproduct, of, silicone, production, these, compounds, are, volatile, and, hence, can, be, purified, by, repeated, fractional, distillation, followed, by, reduction, to, elemental, silicon, with, very, pure, zinc, metal, as, the, reducing, agent, the, spongy, pieces, of, silicon, thus, produced, are, melted, and, then, grown, to, form, cylindrical, single, crystals, before, being, purified, by, zone, refining, other, routes, use, the, thermal, decomposition, of, silane, or, tetraiodosilane, sii, 4, another, process, used, is, the, reduction, of, sodium, hexafluorosilicate, a, common, waste, product, of, the, phosphate, fertilizer, industry, by, metallic, sodium, this, is, highly, exothermic, and, hence, requires, no, outside, energy, source, hyperfine, silicon, is, made, at, a, higher, purity, than, almost, any, other, material, transistor, production, requires, impurity, levels, in, silicon, crystals, less, than, 1, part, per, 10, 10, and, in, special, cases, impurity, levels, below, 1, part, per, 10, 12, are, needed, and, attained, silicon, nanostructures, can, directly, be, produced, from, silica, sand, using, conventional, metalothermic, processes, or, the, combustion, synthesis, approach, such, nanostructured, silicon, materials, can, be, used, in, various, functional, applications, including, the, anode, of, lithium, ion, batteries, libs, other, ion, batteries, future, computing, devices, like, memristors, or, photocatalytic, applications, most, silicon, is, used, industrially, without, being, purified, often, with, comparatively, little, processing, from, its, natural, form, more, than, 90, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, composed, of, silicate, minerals, which, are, compounds, of, silicon, and, oxygen, often, with, metallic, ions, when, negatively, charged, silicate, anions, require, cations, to, balance, the, charge, many, of, these, have, direct, commercial, uses, such, as, clays, silica, sand, and, most, kinds, of, building, stone, thus, the, vast, majority, of, uses, for, silicon, are, as, structural, compounds, either, as, the, silicate, minerals, or, silica, crude, silicon, dioxide, silicates, are, used, in, making, portland, cement, made, mostly, of, calcium, silicates, which, is, used, in, building, mortar, and, modern, stucco, but, more, importantly, combined, with, silica, sand, and, gravel, usually, containing, silicate, minerals, such, as, granite, to, make, the, concrete, that, is, the, basis, of, most, of, the, very, largest, industrial, building, projects, of, the, modern, world, silica, is, used, to, make, fire, brick, a, type, of, ceramic, silicate, minerals, are, also, in, whiteware, ceramics, an, important, class, of, products, usually, containing, various, types, of, fired, clay, minerals, natural, aluminium, phyllosilicates, an, example, is, porcelain, which, is, based, on, the, silicate, mineral, kaolinite, traditional, glass, silica, based, soda, lime, glass, also, functions, in, many, of, the, same, ways, and, also, is, used, for, windows, and, containers, in, addition, specialty, silica, based, glass, fibers, are, used, for, optical, fiber, as, well, as, to, produce, fiberglass, for, structural, support, and, glass, wool, for, thermal, insulation, silicones, often, are, used, in, waterproofing, treatments, molding, compounds, mold, release, agents, mechanical, seals, high, temperature, greases, and, waxes, and, caulking, compounds, silicone, is, also, sometimes, used, in, breast, implants, contact, lenses, explosives, and, pyrotechnics, silly, putty, was, originally, made, by, adding, boric, acid, to, silicone, oil, other, silicon, compounds, function, as, high, technology, abrasives, and, new, high, strength, ceramics, based, upon, silicon, carbide, silicon, is, a, component, of, some, superalloys, elemental, silicon, is, added, to, molten, cast, iron, as, ferrosilicon, or, silicocalcium, alloys, to, improve, performance, in, casting, thin, sections, and, to, prevent, the, formation, of, cementite, where, exposed, to, outside, air, the, presence, of, elemental, silicon, in, molten, iron, acts, as, a, sink, for, oxygen, so, that, the, steel, carbon, content, which, must, be, kept, within, narrow, limits, for, each, type, of, steel, can, be, more, closely, controlled, ferrosilicon, production, and, use, is, a, monitor, of, the, steel, industry, and, although, this, form, of, elemental, silicon, is, grossly, impure, it, accounts, for, 80, of, the, world, s, use, of, free, silicon, silicon, is, an, important, constituent, of, transformer, steel, modifying, its, resistivity, and, ferromagnetic, properties, the, properties, of, silicon, may, be, used, to, modify, alloys, with, metals, other, than, iron, metallurgical, grade, silicon, is, silicon, of, 95, 99, purity, about, 55, of, the, world, consumption, of, metallurgical, purity, silicon, goes, for, production, of, aluminium, silicon, alloys, silumin, alloys, for, aluminium, part, casts, mainly, for, use, in, the, automotive, industry, silicon, s, importance, in, aluminium, casting, is, that, a, significantly, high, amount, 12, of, silicon, in, aluminium, forms, a, eutectic, mixture, which, solidifies, with, very, little, thermal, contraction, this, greatly, reduces, tearing, and, cracks, formed, from, stress, as, casting, alloys, cool, to, solidity, silicon, also, significantly, improves, the, hardness, and, thus, wear, resistance, of, aluminium, most, elemental, silicon, produced, remains, as, a, ferrosilicon, alloy, and, only, approximately, 20, is, refined, to, metallurgical, grade, purity, a, total, of, 1, 3, 1, 5, million, metric, tons, year, an, estimated, 15, of, the, world, production, of, metallurgical, grade, silicon, is, further, refined, to, semiconductor, purity, this, typically, is, the, nine, 9, or, 99, 9999999, purity, nearly, defect, free, single, crystalline, material, monocrystalline, silicon, of, such, purity, is, usually, produced, by, the, czochralski, process, and, is, used, to, produce, silicon, wafers, used, in, the, semiconductor, industry, in, electronics, and, in, some, high, cost, and, high, efficiency, photovoltaic, applications, pure, silicon, is, an, intrinsic, semiconductor, which, means, that, unlike, metals, it, conducts, electron, holes, and, electrons, released, from, atoms, by, heat, silicon, s, electrical, conductivity, increases, with, higher, temperatures, pure, silicon, has, too, low, a, conductivity, i, e, too, high, a, resistivity, to, be, used, as, a, circuit, element, in, electronics, in, practice, pure, silicon, is, doped, with, small, concentrations, of, certain, other, elements, which, greatly, increase, its, conductivity, and, adjust, its, electrical, response, by, controlling, the, number, and, charge, positive, or, negative, of, activated, carriers, such, control, is, necessary, for, transistors, solar, cells, semiconductor, detectors, and, other, semiconductor, devices, used, in, the, computer, industry, and, other, technical, applications, in, silicon, photonics, silicon, may, be, used, as, a, continuous, wave, raman, laser, medium, to, produce, coherent, light, in, common, integrated, circuits, a, wafer, of, monocrystalline, silicon, serves, as, a, mechanical, support, for, the, circuits, which, are, created, by, doping, and, insulated, from, each, other, by, thin, layers, of, silicon, oxide, an, insulator, that, is, easily, produced, on, si, surfaces, by, processes, of, thermal, oxidation, or, local, oxidation, locos, which, involve, exposing, the, element, to, oxygen, under, the, proper, conditions, that, can, be, predicted, by, the, deal, grove, model, silicon, has, become, the, most, popular, material, for, both, high, power, semiconductors, and, integrated, circuits, because, it, can, withstand, the, highest, temperatures, and, greatest, electrical, activity, without, suffering, avalanche, breakdown, an, electron, avalanche, is, created, when, heat, produces, free, electrons, and, holes, which, in, turn, pass, more, current, which, produces, more, heat, in, addition, the, insulating, oxide, of, silicon, is, not, soluble, in, water, which, gives, it, an, advantage, over, germanium, an, element, with, similar, properties, which, can, also, be, used, in, semiconductor, devices, in, certain, fabrication, techniques, monocrystalline, silicon, is, expensive, to, produce, and, is, usually, justified, only, in, production, of, integrated, circuits, where, tiny, crystal, imperfections, can, interfere, with, tiny, circuit, paths, for, other, uses, other, types, of, pure, silicon, may, be, employed, these, include, hydrogenated, amorphous, silicon, and, upgraded, metallurgical, grade, silicon, umg, si, used, in, the, production, of, low, cost, large, area, electronics, in, applications, such, as, liquid, crystal, displays, and, of, large, area, low, cost, thin, film, solar, cells, such, semiconductor, grades, of, silicon, are, either, slightly, less, pure, or, polycrystalline, rather, than, monocrystalline, and, are, produced, in, comparable, quantities, as, the, monocrystalline, silicon, 75, 000, to, 150, 000, metric, tons, per, year, the, market, for, the, lesser, grade, is, growing, more, quickly, than, for, monocrystalline, silicon, by, 2013, polycrystalline, silicon, production, used, mostly, in, solar, cells, was, projected, to, reach, 200, 000, metric, tons, per, year, while, monocrystalline, semiconductor, grade, silicon, was, expected, to, remain, less, than, 50, 000, tons, per, year, silicon, quantum, dots, are, created, through, the, thermal, processing, of, hydrogen, silsesquioxane, into, nanocrystals, ranging, from, a, few, nanometers, to, a, few, microns, displaying, size, dependent, luminescent, properties, the, nanocrystals, display, large, stokes, shifts, converting, photons, in, the, ultraviolet, range, to, photons, in, the, visible, or, infrared, depending, on, the, particle, size, allowing, for, applications, in, quantum, dot, displays, and, luminescent, solar, concentrators, due, to, their, limited, self, absorption, a, benefit, of, using, silicon, based, quantum, dots, over, cadmium, or, indium, is, the, non, toxic, metal, free, nature, of, silicon, another, application, of, silicon, quantum, dots, is, for, sensing, of, hazardous, materials, the, sensors, take, advantage, of, the, luminescent, properties, of, the, quantum, dots, through, quenching, of, the, photoluminescence, in, the, presence, of, the, hazardous, substance, there, are, many, methods, used, for, hazardous, chemical, sensing, with, a, few, being, electron, transfer, fluorescence, resonance, energy, transfer, and, photocurrent, generation, electron, transfer, quenching, occurs, when, the, lowest, unoccupied, molecular, orbital, lumo, is, slightly, lower, in, energy, than, the, conduction, band, of, the, quantum, dot, allowing, for, the, transfer, of, electrons, between, the, two, preventing, recombination, of, the, holes, and, electrons, within, the, nanocrystals, the, effect, can, also, be, achieved, in, reverse, with, a, donor, molecule, having, its, highest, occupied, molecular, orbital, homo, slightly, higher, than, a, valence, band, edge, of, the, quantum, dot, allowing, electrons, to, transfer, between, them, filling, the, holes, and, preventing, recombination, fluorescence, resonance, energy, transfer, occurs, when, a, complex, forms, between, the, quantum, dot, and, a, quencher, molecule, the, complex, will, continue, to, absorb, light, but, when, the, energy, is, converted, to, the, ground, state, it, does, not, release, a, photon, quenching, the, material, the, third, method, uses, different, approach, by, measuring, the, photocurrent, emitted, by, the, quantum, dots, instead, of, monitoring, the, photoluminescent, display, if, the, concentration, of, the, desired, chemical, increases, then, the, photocurrent, given, off, by, the, nanocrystals, will, change, in, response, although, silicon, is, readily, available, in, the, form, of, silicates, very, few, organisms, use, it, directly, diatoms, radiolaria, and, siliceous, sponges, use, biogenic, silica, as, a, structural, material, for, their, skeletons, some, plants, accumulate, silica, in, their, tissues, and, require, silicon, for, their, growth, for, example, rice, silicon, may, be, taken, up, by, plants, as, orthosilicic, acid, also, known, as, monosilicic, acid, and, transported, through, the, xylem, where, it, forms, amorphous, complexes, with, components, of, the, cell, wall, this, has, been, shown, to, improve, cell, wall, strength, and, structural, integrity, in, some, plants, thereby, reducing, insect, herbivory, and, pathogenic, infections, in, certain, plants, silicon, may, also, upregulate, the, production, of, volatile, organic, compounds, and, phytohormones, which, play, a, significant, role, in, plant, defense, mechanisms, in, more, advanced, plants, the, silica, phytoliths, opal, phytoliths, are, rigid, microscopic, bodies, occurring, in, the, cell, several, horticultural, crops, are, known, to, protect, themselves, against, fungal, plant, pathogens, with, silica, to, such, a, degree, that, fungicide, application, may, fail, unless, accompanied, by, sufficient, silicon, nutrition, silicaceous, plant, defense, molecules, activate, some, phytoalexins, meaning, some, of, them, are, signalling, substances, producing, acquired, immunity, when, deprived, some, plants, will, substitute, with, increased, production, of, other, defensive, substances, life, on, earth, is, largely, composed, of, carbon, but, astrobiology, considers, that, extraterrestrial, life, may, have, other, hypothetical, types, of, biochemistry, silicon, is, considered, an, alternative, to, carbon, as, it, can, create, complex, and, stable, molecules, with, four, covalent, bonds, required, for, a, dna, analog, and, it, is, available, in, large, quantities, diatoms, use, silicon, in, the, biogenic, silica, bsi, form, which, is, taken, up, by, the, silicon, transport, protein, sit, to, be, predominantly, used, in, the, cell, wall, structure, as, frustules, silicon, enters, the, ocean, in, a, dissolved, form, such, as, silicic, acid, or, silicate, since, diatoms, are, one, of, the, main, users, of, these, forms, of, silicon, they, contribute, greatly, to, the, concentration, of, silicon, throughout, the, ocean, silicon, forms, a, nutrient, like, profile, in, the, ocean, due, to, the, diatom, productivity, in, shallow, depths, therefore, concentration, of, silicon, is, lower, in, the, shallow, ocean, and, higher, in, the, deep, ocean, diatom, productivity, in, the, upper, ocean, contributes, to, the, amount, of, silicon, exported, to, the, lower, ocean, when, diatom, cells, are, lysed, in, the, upper, ocean, their, nutrients, such, as, iron, zinc, and, silicon, are, brought, to, the, lower, ocean, through, a, process, called, marine, snow, marine, snow, involves, the, downward, transfer, of, particulate, organic, matter, by, vertical, mixing, of, dissolved, organic, matter, it, has, been, suggested, that, silicon, is, considered, crucial, to, diatom, productivity, and, as, long, as, there, is, silicic, acid, available, for, diatoms, to, use, the, diatoms, can, contribute, to, other, important, nutrient, concentrations, in, the, deep, ocean, as, well, in, coastal, zones, diatoms, serve, as, the, major, phytoplanktonic, organisms, and, greatly, contribute, to, biogenic, silica, production, in, the, open, ocean, however, diatoms, have, a, reduced, role, in, global, annual, silica, production, diatoms, in, north, atlantic, and, north, pacific, subtropical, gyres, only, contribute, about, 5, 7, of, global, annual, marine, silica, production, the, southern, ocean, produces, about, one, third, of, global, marine, biogenic, silica, the, southern, ocean, is, referred, to, as, having, a, biogeochemical, divide, since, only, minuscule, amounts, of, silicon, are, transported, out, of, this, region, there, is, some, evidence, that, silicon, is, important, to, human, health, for, their, nail, hair, bone, and, skin, tissues, for, example, in, studies, that, demonstrate, that, premenopausal, women, with, higher, dietary, silicon, intake, have, higher, bone, density, and, that, silicon, supplementation, can, increase, bone, volume, and, density, in, patients, with, osteoporosis, silicon, is, needed, for, synthesis, of, elastin, and, collagen, of, which, the, aorta, contains, the, greatest, quantity, in, the, human, body, and, has, been, considered, an, essential, element, nevertheless, it, is, difficult, to, prove, its, essentiality, because, silicon, is, very, common, and, hence, deficiency, symptoms, are, difficult, to, reproduce, silicon, is, currently, under, consideration, for, elevation, to, the, status, of, a, plant, beneficial, substance, by, the, association, of, american, plant, food, control, officials, aapfco, people, may, be, exposed, to, elemental, silicon, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, it, in, swallowing, it, or, having, contact, with, the, skin, or, eye, in, the, latter, two, cases, silicon, poses, a, slight, hazard, as, an, irritant, it, is, hazardous, if, inhaled, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, for, silicon, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 15, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 10, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, inhalation, of, crystalline, silica, dust, may, lead, to, silicosis, an, occupational, lung, disease, marked, by, inflammation, and, scarring, in, the, form, of, nodular, lesions, in, the, upper, lobes, of, the, lungs
