rapids, are, sections, of, a, river, where, the, river, bed, has, a, relatively, steep, gradient, causing, an, increase, in, water, velocity, and, turbulence, flow, gradient, constriction, and, obstacles, are, four, factors, that, are, needed, for, a, rapid, to, be, created, rapids, are, hydrological, features, between, a, run, a, smoothly, flowing, part, of, a, stream, and, a, cascade, rapids, are, characterized, by, the, river, becoming, shallower, with, some, rocks, exposed, above, the, flow, surface, as, flowing, water, splashes, over, and, around, the, rocks, air, bubbles, become, mixed, in, with, it, and, portions, of, the, surface, acquire, a, white, color, forming, what, is, called, whitewater, rapids, occur, where, the, bed, material, is, highly, resistant, to, the, erosive, power, of, the, stream, in, comparison, with, the, bed, downstream, of, the, rapids, very, young, streams, flowing, across, solid, rock, may, be, rapids, for, much, of, their, length, rapids, cause, water, aeration, of, the, stream, or, river, resulting, in, better, water, quality, for, a, rapid, to, form, a, necessary, condition, is, the, presence, of, a, gradient, which, refers, to, the, river, or, stream, s, downward, slope, when, a, river, has, a, larger, gradient, the, water, flows, downhill, faster, gradients, are, typically, measured, in, feet, per, mile, this, impacts, the, river, s, flow, or, discharge, which, is, measured, as, a, volume, of, water, per, unit, of, time, the, faster, the, water, flows, the, more, likely, a, rapid, will, form, rapids, are, categorized, in, classes, generally, running, from, i, to, vi, a, class, 5, rapid, may, be, categorized, as, class, 5, 1, 5, 9, while, class, i, rapids, are, easy, to, navigate, and, require, little, maneuvering, class, vi, rapids, pose, threat, to, life, with, little, or, no, chance, for, rescue, river, rafting, sports, are, carried, out, where, many, rapids, are, present, in, the, course, constriction, refers, to, when, rivers, flow, through, narrower, channels, thus, increasing, the, velocity, of, the, water, this, may, also, lead, to, the, creation, of, obstructions, due, to, sediment, transportation, and, erosion, obstacles, may, occur, by, human, activity, natural, landslides, and, earthquakes, or, accumulation, of, sediment, or, debris, the, more, prominent, these, four, factors, are, present, in, a, river, the, more, likely, that, river, is, to, be, a, rapid, river
