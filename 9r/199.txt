an, h, ii, region, or, hii, region, is, a, region, of, interstellar, atomic, hydrogen, that, is, ionized, it, is, typically, in, a, molecular, cloud, of, partially, ionized, gas, in, which, star, formation, has, recently, taken, place, with, a, size, ranging, from, one, to, hundreds, of, light, years, and, density, from, a, few, to, about, a, million, particles, per, cubic, centimetre, the, orion, nebula, now, known, to, be, an, h, ii, region, was, observed, in, 1610, by, nicolas, claude, fabri, de, peiresc, by, telescope, the, first, such, object, discovered, the, regions, may, be, of, any, shape, because, the, distribution, of, the, stars, and, gas, inside, them, is, irregular, the, short, lived, blue, stars, created, in, these, regions, emit, copious, amounts, of, ultraviolet, light, that, ionize, the, surrounding, gas, h, ii, regions, sometimes, several, hundred, light, years, across, are, often, associated, with, giant, molecular, clouds, they, often, appear, clumpy, and, filamentary, sometimes, showing, intricate, shapes, such, as, the, horsehead, nebula, h, ii, regions, may, give, birth, to, thousands, of, stars, over, a, period, of, several, million, years, in, the, end, supernova, explosions, and, strong, stellar, winds, from, the, most, massive, stars, in, the, resulting, star, cluster, disperse, the, gases, of, the, h, ii, region, leaving, a, cluster, of, stars, which, have, formed, h, ii, regions, can, be, observed, at, considerable, distances, in, the, universe, and, the, study, of, extragalactic, h, ii, regions, is, important, in, determining, the, distances, and, chemical, composition, of, galaxies, spiral, and, irregular, galaxies, contain, many, h, ii, regions, while, elliptical, galaxies, are, almost, devoid, of, them, in, spiral, galaxies, including, our, milky, way, h, ii, regions, are, concentrated, in, the, spiral, arms, while, in, irregular, galaxies, they, are, distributed, chaotically, some, galaxies, contain, huge, h, ii, regions, which, may, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, stars, examples, include, the, 30, doradus, region, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, and, ngc, 604, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, the, term, h, ii, is, pronounced, h, two, by, astronomers, h, is, the, chemical, symbol, for, hydrogen, and, ii, is, the, roman, numeral, for, 2, it, is, customary, in, astronomy, to, use, the, roman, numeral, i, for, neutral, atoms, ii, for, singly, ionised, h, ii, is, h, in, other, sciences, iii, for, doubly, ionised, e, g, o, iii, is, o, 2, etc, h, ii, or, h, consists, of, free, protons, an, h, i, region, consists, of, neutral, atomic, hydrogen, and, a, molecular, cloud, of, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, in, spoken, discussion, with, non, astronomers, there, is, sometimes, confusion, between, the, identical, spoken, forms, of, h, ii, and, h, 2, a, few, of, the, brightest, h, ii, regions, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, however, none, seem, to, have, been, noticed, before, the, advent, of, the, telescope, in, the, early, 17th, century, even, galileo, did, not, notice, the, orion, nebula, when, he, first, observed, the, star, cluster, within, it, previously, cataloged, as, a, single, star, orionis, by, johann, bayer, the, french, observer, nicolas, claude, fabri, de, peiresc, is, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, orion, nebula, in, 1610, since, that, early, observation, large, numbers, of, h, ii, regions, have, been, discovered, in, the, milky, way, and, other, galaxies, william, herschel, observed, the, orion, nebula, in, 1774, and, described, it, later, as, an, unformed, fiery, mist, the, chaotic, material, of, future, suns, in, early, days, astronomers, distinguished, between, diffuse, nebulae, now, known, to, be, h, ii, regions, which, retained, their, fuzzy, appearance, under, magnification, through, a, large, telescope, and, nebulae, that, could, be, resolved, into, stars, now, known, to, be, galaxies, external, to, our, own, confirmation, of, herschel, s, hypothesis, of, star, formation, had, to, wait, another, hundred, years, when, william, huggins, together, with, his, wife, mary, huggins, turned, his, spectroscope, on, various, nebulae, some, such, as, the, andromeda, nebula, had, spectra, quite, similar, to, those, of, stars, but, turned, out, to, be, galaxies, consisting, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, individual, stars, others, looked, very, different, rather, than, a, strong, continuum, with, absorption, lines, superimposed, the, orion, nebula, and, other, similar, objects, showed, only, a, small, number, of, emission, lines, in, planetary, nebulae, the, brightest, of, these, spectral, lines, was, at, a, wavelength, of, 500, 7, nanometres, which, did, not, correspond, with, a, line, of, any, known, chemical, element, at, first, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, line, might, be, due, to, an, unknown, element, which, was, named, nebulium, a, similar, idea, had, led, to, the, discovery, of, helium, through, analysis, of, the, sun, s, spectrum, in, 1868, however, while, helium, was, isolated, on, earth, soon, after, its, discovery, in, the, spectrum, of, the, sun, nebulium, was, not, in, the, early, 20th, century, henry, norris, russell, proposed, that, rather, than, being, a, new, element, the, line, at, 500, 7, nm, was, due, to, a, familiar, element, in, unfamiliar, conditions, interstellar, matter, considered, dense, in, an, astronomical, context, is, at, high, vacuum, by, laboratory, standards, physicists, showed, in, the, 1920s, that, in, gas, at, extremely, low, density, electrons, can, populate, excited, metastable, energy, levels, in, atoms, and, ions, which, at, higher, densities, are, rapidly, de, excited, by, collisions, electron, transitions, from, these, levels, in, doubly, ionized, oxygen, give, rise, to, the, 500, 7, nm, line, these, spectral, lines, which, can, only, be, seen, in, very, low, density, gases, are, called, forbidden, lines, spectroscopic, observations, thus, showed, that, planetary, nebulae, consisted, largely, of, extremely, rarefied, ionised, oxygen, gas, oiii, during, the, 20th, century, observations, showed, that, h, ii, regions, often, contained, hot, bright, stars, these, stars, are, many, times, more, massive, than, the, sun, and, are, the, shortest, lived, stars, with, total, lifetimes, of, only, a, few, million, years, compared, to, stars, like, the, sun, which, live, for, several, billion, years, therefore, it, was, surmised, that, h, ii, regions, must, be, regions, in, which, new, stars, were, forming, over, a, period, of, several, million, years, a, cluster, of, stars, will, form, in, an, h, ii, region, before, radiation, pressure, from, the, hot, young, stars, causes, the, nebula, to, disperse, the, precursor, to, an, h, ii, region, is, a, giant, molecular, cloud, gmc, a, gmc, is, a, cold, 10, 20, k, and, dense, cloud, consisting, mostly, of, molecular, hydrogen, gmcs, can, exist, in, a, stable, state, for, long, periods, of, time, but, shock, waves, due, to, supernovae, collisions, between, clouds, and, magnetic, interactions, can, trigger, its, collapse, when, this, happens, via, a, process, of, collapse, and, fragmentation, of, the, cloud, stars, are, born, see, stellar, evolution, for, a, lengthier, description, as, stars, are, born, within, a, gmc, the, most, massive, will, reach, temperatures, hot, enough, to, ionise, the, surrounding, gas, soon, after, the, formation, of, an, ionising, radiation, field, energetic, photons, create, an, ionisation, front, which, sweeps, through, the, surrounding, gas, at, supersonic, speeds, at, greater, and, greater, distances, from, the, ionising, star, the, ionisation, front, slows, while, the, pressure, of, the, newly, ionised, gas, causes, the, ionised, volume, to, expand, eventually, the, ionisation, front, slows, to, subsonic, speeds, and, is, overtaken, by, the, shock, front, caused, by, the, expansion, of, the, material, ejected, from, the, nebula, the, h, ii, region, has, been, born, the, lifetime, of, an, h, ii, region, is, of, the, order, of, a, few, million, years, radiation, pressure, from, the, hot, young, stars, will, eventually, drive, most, of, the, gas, away, in, fact, the, whole, process, tends, to, be, very, inefficient, with, less, than, 10, percent, of, the, gas, in, the, h, ii, region, forming, into, stars, before, the, rest, is, blown, off, contributing, to, the, loss, of, gas, are, the, supernova, explosions, of, the, most, massive, stars, which, will, occur, after, only, 1, 2, million, years, stars, form, in, clumps, of, cool, molecular, gas, that, hide, the, nascent, stars, it, is, only, when, the, radiation, pressure, from, a, star, drives, away, its, cocoon, that, it, becomes, visible, the, hot, blue, stars, that, are, powerful, enough, to, ionize, significant, amounts, of, hydrogen, and, form, h, ii, regions, will, do, this, quickly, and, light, up, the, region, in, which, they, just, formed, the, dense, regions, which, contain, younger, or, less, massive, still, forming, stars, and, which, have, not, yet, blown, away, the, material, from, which, they, are, forming, are, often, seen, in, silhouette, against, the, rest, of, the, ionised, nebula, bart, bok, and, e, f, reilly, searched, astronomical, photographs, in, the, 1940s, for, relatively, small, dark, nebulae, following, suggestions, that, stars, might, be, formed, from, condensations, in, the, interstellar, medium, they, found, several, such, approximately, circular, or, oval, dark, objects, of, small, size, which, they, referred, to, as, globules, since, referred, to, as, bok, globules, bok, proposed, at, the, december, 1946, harvard, observatory, centennial, symposia, that, these, globules, were, likely, sites, of, star, formation, it, was, confirmed, in, 1990, that, they, were, indeed, stellar, birthplaces, the, hot, young, stars, dissipate, these, globules, as, the, radiation, from, the, stars, powering, the, h, ii, region, drives, the, material, away, in, this, sense, the, stars, which, generate, h, ii, regions, act, to, destroy, stellar, nurseries, in, doing, so, however, one, last, burst, of, star, formation, may, be, triggered, as, radiation, pressure, and, mechanical, pressure, from, supernova, may, act, to, squeeze, globules, thereby, enhancing, the, density, within, them, the, young, stars, in, h, ii, regions, show, evidence, for, containing, planetary, systems, the, hubble, space, telescope, has, revealed, hundreds, of, protoplanetary, disks, proplyds, in, the, orion, nebula, at, least, half, the, young, stars, in, the, orion, nebula, appear, to, be, surrounded, by, disks, of, gas, and, dust, thought, to, contain, many, times, as, much, matter, as, would, be, needed, to, create, a, planetary, system, like, the, solar, system, h, ii, regions, vary, greatly, in, their, physical, properties, they, range, in, size, from, so, called, ultra, compact, uchii, regions, perhaps, only, a, light, year, or, less, across, to, giant, h, ii, regions, several, hundred, light, years, across, their, size, is, also, known, as, the, stromgren, radius, and, essentially, depends, on, the, intensity, of, the, source, of, ionising, photons, and, the, density, of, the, region, their, densities, range, from, over, a, million, particles, per, cm, 3, in, the, ultra, compact, h, ii, regions, to, only, a, few, particles, per, cm, 3, in, the, largest, and, most, extended, regions, this, implies, total, masses, between, perhaps, 100, and, 10, 5, solar, masses, there, are, also, ultra, dense, h, ii, regions, udhii, depending, on, the, size, of, an, h, ii, region, there, may, be, several, thousand, stars, within, it, this, makes, h, ii, regions, more, complicated, than, planetary, nebulae, which, have, only, one, central, ionising, source, typically, h, ii, regions, reach, temperatures, of, 10, 000, k, they, are, mostly, ionised, gases, with, weak, magnetic, fields, with, strengths, of, several, nanoteslas, nevertheless, h, ii, regions, are, almost, always, associated, with, a, cold, molecular, gas, which, originated, from, the, same, parent, gmc, magnetic, fields, are, produced, by, these, weak, moving, electric, charges, in, the, ionised, gas, suggesting, that, h, ii, regions, might, contain, electric, fields, a, number, of, h, ii, regions, also, show, signs, of, being, permeated, by, a, plasma, with, temperatures, exceeding, 10, 000, 000, k, sufficiently, hot, to, emit, x, rays, x, ray, observatories, such, as, einstein, and, chandra, have, noted, diffuse, x, ray, emissions, in, a, number, of, star, forming, regions, notably, the, orion, nebula, messier, 17, and, the, carina, nebula, the, hot, gas, is, likely, supplied, by, the, strong, stellar, winds, from, o, type, stars, which, may, be, heated, by, supersonic, shock, waves, in, the, winds, through, collisions, between, winds, from, different, stars, or, through, colliding, winds, channeled, by, magnetic, fields, this, plasma, will, rapidly, expand, to, fill, available, cavities, in, the, molecular, clouds, due, to, the, high, speed, of, sound, in, the, gas, at, this, temperature, it, will, also, leak, out, through, holes, in, the, periphery, of, the, h, ii, region, which, appears, to, be, happening, in, messier, 17, chemically, h, ii, regions, consist, of, about, 90, hydrogen, the, strongest, hydrogen, emission, line, the, h, alpha, line, at, 656, 3, nm, gives, h, ii, regions, their, characteristic, red, colour, this, emission, line, comes, from, excited, un, ionized, hydrogen, h, beta, is, also, emitted, but, at, approximately, 1, 3, of, the, intensity, of, h, alpha, most, of, the, rest, of, an, h, ii, region, consists, of, helium, with, trace, amounts, of, heavier, elements, across, the, galaxy, it, is, found, that, the, amount, of, heavy, elements, in, h, ii, regions, decreases, with, increasing, distance, from, the, galactic, centre, this, is, because, over, the, lifetime, of, the, galaxy, star, formation, rates, have, been, greater, in, the, denser, central, regions, resulting, in, greater, enrichment, of, those, regions, of, the, interstellar, medium, with, the, products, of, nucleosynthesis, h, ii, regions, are, found, only, in, spiral, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, and, irregular, galaxies, they, are, not, seen, in, elliptical, galaxies, in, irregular, galaxies, they, may, be, dispersed, throughout, the, galaxy, but, in, spirals, they, are, most, abundant, within, the, spiral, arms, a, large, spiral, galaxy, may, contain, thousands, of, h, ii, regions, the, reason, h, ii, regions, rarely, appear, in, elliptical, galaxies, is, that, ellipticals, are, believed, to, form, through, galaxy, mergers, in, galaxy, clusters, such, mergers, are, frequent, when, galaxies, collide, individual, stars, almost, never, collide, but, the, gmcs, and, h, ii, regions, in, the, colliding, galaxies, are, severely, agitated, under, these, conditions, enormous, bursts, of, star, formation, are, triggered, so, rapid, that, most, of, the, gas, is, converted, into, stars, rather, than, the, normal, rate, of, 10, or, less, galaxies, undergoing, such, rapid, star, formation, are, known, as, starburst, galaxies, the, post, merger, elliptical, galaxy, has, a, very, low, gas, content, and, so, h, ii, regions, can, no, longer, form, twenty, first, century, observations, have, shown, that, a, very, small, number, of, h, ii, regions, exist, outside, galaxies, altogether, these, intergalactic, h, ii, regions, may, be, the, remnants, of, tidal, disruptions, of, small, galaxies, and, in, some, cases, may, represent, a, new, generation, of, stars, in, a, galaxy, s, most, recently, accreted, gas, h, ii, regions, come, in, an, enormous, variety, of, sizes, they, are, usually, clumpy, and, inhomogeneous, on, all, scales, from, the, smallest, to, largest, each, star, within, an, h, ii, region, ionises, a, roughly, spherical, region, known, as, a, str, mgren, sphere, of, the, surrounding, gas, but, the, combination, of, ionisation, spheres, of, multiple, stars, within, a, h, ii, region, and, the, expansion, of, the, heated, nebula, into, surrounding, gases, creates, sharp, density, gradients, that, result, in, complex, shapes, supernova, explosions, may, also, sculpt, h, ii, regions, in, some, cases, the, formation, of, a, large, star, cluster, within, an, h, ii, region, results, in, the, region, being, hollowed, out, from, within, this, is, the, case, for, ngc, 604, a, giant, h, ii, region, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, for, a, h, ii, region, which, cannot, be, resolved, some, information, on, the, spatial, structure, the, electron, density, as, a, function, of, the, distance, from, the, center, and, an, estimate, of, the, clumpiness, can, be, inferred, by, performing, an, inverse, laplace, transform, on, the, frequency, spectrum, notable, galactic, h, ii, regions, include, the, orion, nebula, the, eta, carinae, nebula, and, the, berkeley, 59, cepheus, ob4, complex, the, orion, nebula, about, 500, pc, 1, 500, light, years, from, earth, is, part, of, omc, 1, a, giant, molecular, cloud, that, if, visible, would, be, seen, to, fill, most, of, the, constellation, of, orion, the, horsehead, nebula, and, barnard, s, loop, are, two, other, illuminated, parts, of, this, cloud, of, gas, the, orion, nebula, is, actually, a, thin, layer, of, ionised, gas, on, the, outer, border, of, the, omc, 1, cloud, the, stars, in, the, trapezium, cluster, and, especially, 1, orionis, are, responsible, for, this, ionisation, the, large, magellanic, cloud, a, satellite, galaxy, of, the, milky, way, at, about, 50, kpc, 160, thousand, light, years, contains, a, giant, h, ii, region, called, the, tarantula, nebula, measuring, at, about, 200, pc, 650, light, years, across, this, nebula, is, the, most, massive, and, the, second, largest, h, ii, region, in, the, local, group, it, is, much, bigger, than, the, orion, nebula, and, is, forming, thousands, of, stars, some, with, masses, of, over, 100, times, that, of, the, sun, ob, and, wolf, rayet, stars, if, the, tarantula, nebula, were, as, close, to, earth, as, the, orion, nebula, it, would, shine, about, as, brightly, as, the, full, moon, in, the, night, sky, the, supernova, sn, 1987a, occurred, in, the, outskirts, of, the, tarantula, nebula, another, giant, h, ii, region, ngc, 604, is, located, in, m33, spiral, galaxy, which, is, at, 817, kpc, 2, 66, million, light, years, measuring, at, approximately, 240, 250, pc, 800, 830, light, years, across, ngc, 604, is, the, second, most, massive, h, ii, region, in, the, local, group, after, the, tarantula, nebula, although, it, is, slightly, larger, in, size, than, the, latter, it, contains, around, 200, hot, ob, and, wolf, rayet, stars, which, heat, the, gas, inside, it, to, millions, of, degrees, producing, bright, x, ray, emissions, the, total, mass, of, the, hot, gas, in, ngc, 604, is, about, 6, 000, solar, masses, as, with, planetary, nebulae, estimates, of, the, abundance, of, elements, in, h, ii, regions, are, subject, to, some, uncertainty, there, are, two, different, ways, of, determining, the, abundance, of, metals, metals, in, this, case, are, elements, other, than, hydrogen, and, helium, in, nebulae, which, rely, on, different, types, of, spectral, lines, and, large, discrepancies, are, sometimes, seen, between, the, results, derived, from, the, two, methods, some, astronomers, put, this, down, to, the, presence, of, small, temperature, fluctuations, within, h, ii, regions, others, claim, that, the, discrepancies, are, too, large, to, be, explained, by, temperature, effects, and, hypothesise, the, existence, of, cold, knots, containing, very, little, hydrogen, to, explain, the, observations, the, full, details, of, massive, star, formation, within, h, ii, regions, are, not, yet, well, known, two, major, problems, hamper, research, in, this, area, first, the, distance, from, earth, to, large, h, ii, regions, is, considerable, with, the, nearest, h, ii, california, nebula, region, at, 300, pc, 1, 000, light, years, other, h, ii, regions, are, several, times, that, distance, from, earth, secondly, the, formation, of, these, stars, is, deeply, obscured, by, dust, and, visible, light, observations, are, impossible, radio, and, infrared, light, can, penetrate, the, dust, but, the, youngest, stars, may, not, emit, much, light, at, these, wavelengths
