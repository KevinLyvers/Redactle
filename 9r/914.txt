radio, waves, are, a, type, of, electromagnetic, radiation, with, the, lowest, frequencies, and, the, longest, wavelengths, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, typically, with, frequencies, below, 300, gigahertz, ghz, and, wavelengths, greater, than, 1, millimeter, 3, 64, inch, about, the, diameter, of, a, grain, of, rice, like, all, electromagnetic, waves, radio, waves, in, a, vacuum, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, and, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, at, a, slightly, lower, speed, radio, waves, are, generated, by, charged, particles, undergoing, acceleration, such, as, time, varying, electric, currents, naturally, occurring, radio, waves, are, emitted, by, lightning, and, astronomical, objects, and, are, part, of, the, blackbody, radiation, emitted, by, all, warm, objects, radio, waves, are, generated, artificially, by, an, electronic, device, called, a, transmitter, which, is, connected, to, an, antenna, which, radiates, the, waves, they, are, received, by, another, antenna, connected, to, a, radio, receiver, which, processes, the, received, signal, radio, waves, are, very, widely, used, in, modern, technology, for, fixed, and, mobile, radio, communication, broadcasting, radar, and, radio, navigation, systems, communications, satellites, wireless, computer, networks, and, many, other, applications, different, frequencies, of, radio, waves, have, different, propagation, characteristics, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, long, waves, can, diffract, around, obstacles, like, mountains, and, follow, the, contour, of, the, earth, ground, waves, shorter, waves, can, reflect, off, the, ionosphere, and, return, to, earth, beyond, the, horizon, skywaves, while, much, shorter, wavelengths, bend, or, diffract, very, little, and, travel, on, a, line, of, sight, so, their, propagation, distances, are, limited, to, the, visual, horizon, to, prevent, interference, between, different, users, the, artificial, generation, and, use, of, radio, waves, is, strictly, regulated, by, law, coordinated, by, an, international, body, called, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, which, defines, radio, waves, as, electromagnetic, waves, of, frequencies, arbitrarily, lower, than, 3, 000, ghz, propagated, in, space, without, artificial, guide, the, radio, spectrum, is, divided, into, a, number, of, radio, bands, on, the, basis, of, frequency, allocated, to, different, uses, higher, frequency, shorter, wavelength, radio, waves, are, called, microwaves, radio, waves, were, first, predicted, by, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, that, was, proposed, in, 1867, by, scottish, mathematical, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, his, mathematical, theory, now, called, maxwell, s, equations, predicted, that, a, coupled, electric, and, magnetic, field, could, travel, through, space, as, an, electromagnetic, wave, maxwell, proposed, that, light, consisted, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, very, short, wavelength, in, 1887, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, demonstrated, the, reality, of, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, waves, by, experimentally, generating, radio, waves, in, his, laboratory, showing, that, they, exhibited, the, same, wave, properties, as, light, standing, waves, refraction, diffraction, and, polarization, italian, inventor, guglielmo, marconi, developed, the, first, practical, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, around, 1894, 1895, he, received, the, 1909, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, radio, work, radio, communication, began, to, be, used, commercially, around, 1900, the, modern, term, radio, wave, replaced, the, original, name, hertzian, wave, around, 1912, radio, waves, are, radiated, by, charged, particles, when, they, are, accelerated, natural, sources, of, radio, waves, include, radio, noise, produced, by, lightning, and, other, natural, processes, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, astronomical, radio, sources, in, space, such, as, the, sun, galaxies, and, nebulas, all, warm, objects, radiate, high, frequency, radio, waves, microwaves, as, part, of, their, black, body, radiation, radio, waves, are, produced, artificially, by, time, varying, electric, currents, consisting, of, electrons, flowing, back, and, forth, in, a, specially, shaped, metal, conductor, called, an, antenna, an, electronic, device, called, a, radio, transmitter, applies, oscillating, electric, current, to, the, antenna, and, the, antenna, radiates, the, power, as, radio, waves, radio, waves, are, received, by, another, antenna, attached, to, a, radio, receiver, when, radio, waves, strike, the, receiving, antenna, they, push, the, electrons, in, the, metal, back, and, forth, creating, tiny, oscillating, currents, which, are, detected, by, the, receiver, from, quantum, mechanics, like, other, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, light, radio, waves, can, alternatively, be, regarded, as, streams, of, uncharged, elementary, particles, called, photons, in, an, antenna, transmitting, radio, waves, the, electrons, in, the, antenna, emit, the, energy, in, discrete, packets, called, radio, photons, while, in, a, receiving, antenna, the, electrons, absorb, the, energy, as, radio, photons, an, antenna, is, a, coherent, emitter, of, photons, like, a, laser, so, the, radio, photons, are, all, in, phase, however, from, planck, s, relation, e, h, displaystyle, e, h, nu, the, energy, of, individual, radio, photons, is, extremely, small, from, 10, 22, to, 10, 30, joules, so, the, antenna, of, even, a, very, low, power, transmitter, emits, an, enormous, number, of, photons, every, second, therefore, except, for, certain, molecular, electron, transition, processes, such, as, atoms, in, a, maser, emitting, microwave, photons, radio, wave, emission, and, absorption, is, usually, regarded, as, a, continuous, classical, process, governed, by, maxwell, s, equations, radio, waves, in, vacuum, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, c, displaystyle, c, when, passing, through, a, material, medium, they, are, slowed, depending, on, the, medium, s, permeability, and, permittivity, air, is, tenuous, enough, that, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, radio, waves, travel, at, very, nearly, the, speed, of, light, the, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, is, the, distance, from, one, peak, crest, of, the, wave, s, electric, field, to, the, next, and, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, of, the, wave, the, relation, of, frequency, and, wavelength, in, a, radio, wave, traveling, in, vacuum, or, air, is, where, equivalently, c, displaystyle, c, the, distance, that, a, radio, wave, travels, in, vacuum, in, one, second, is, 299, 792, 458, meters, 983, 571, 056, ft, which, is, the, wavelength, of, a, 1, hertz, radio, signal, a, 1, megahertz, radio, wave, mid, am, band, has, a, wavelength, of, 299, 79, meters, 983, 6, ft, like, other, electromagnetic, waves, a, radio, wave, has, a, property, called, polarization, which, is, defined, as, the, direction, of, the, wave, s, oscillating, electric, field, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, motion, a, plane, polarized, radio, wave, has, an, electric, field, that, oscillates, in, a, plane, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, motion, in, a, horizontally, polarized, radio, wave, the, electric, field, oscillates, in, a, horizontal, direction, in, a, vertically, polarized, wave, the, electric, field, oscillates, in, a, vertical, direction, in, a, circularly, polarized, wave, the, electric, field, at, any, point, rotates, about, the, direction, of, travel, once, per, cycle, a, right, circularly, polarized, wave, rotates, in, a, right, hand, sense, about, the, direction, of, travel, while, a, left, circularly, polarized, wave, rotates, in, the, opposite, sense, p, 21, the, wave, s, magnetic, field, is, perpendicular, to, the, electric, field, and, the, electric, and, magnetic, field, are, oriented, in, a, right, hand, sense, with, respect, to, the, direction, of, radiation, an, antenna, emits, polarized, radio, waves, with, the, polarization, determined, by, the, direction, of, the, metal, antenna, elements, for, example, a, dipole, antenna, consists, of, two, collinear, metal, rods, if, the, rods, are, horizontal, it, radiates, horizontally, polarized, radio, waves, while, if, the, rods, are, vertical, it, radiates, vertically, polarized, waves, an, antenna, receiving, the, radio, waves, must, have, the, same, polarization, as, the, transmitting, antenna, or, it, will, suffer, a, severe, loss, of, reception, many, natural, sources, of, radio, waves, such, as, the, sun, stars, and, blackbody, radiation, from, warm, objects, emit, unpolarized, waves, consisting, of, incoherent, short, wave, trains, in, an, equal, mixture, of, polarization, states, the, polarization, of, radio, waves, is, determined, by, a, quantum, mechanical, property, of, the, photons, called, their, spin, a, photon, can, have, one, of, two, possible, values, of, spin, it, can, spin, in, a, right, hand, sense, about, its, direction, of, motion, or, in, a, left, hand, sense, right, circularly, polarized, radio, waves, consist, of, photons, spinning, in, a, right, hand, sense, left, circularly, polarized, radio, waves, consist, of, photons, spinning, in, a, left, hand, sense, plane, polarized, radio, waves, consist, of, photons, in, a, quantum, superposition, of, right, and, left, hand, spin, states, the, electric, field, consists, of, a, superposition, of, right, and, left, rotating, fields, resulting, in, a, plane, oscillation, radio, waves, are, more, widely, used, for, communication, than, other, electromagnetic, waves, mainly, because, of, their, desirable, propagation, properties, stemming, from, their, large, wavelength, radio, waves, have, the, ability, to, pass, through, the, atmosphere, in, any, weather, foliage, and, through, most, building, materials, by, diffraction, longer, wavelengths, can, bend, around, obstructions, and, unlike, other, electromagnetic, waves, they, tend, to, be, scattered, rather, than, absorbed, by, objects, larger, than, their, wavelength, the, study, of, radio, propagation, how, radio, waves, move, in, free, space, and, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, vitally, important, in, the, design, of, practical, radio, systems, radio, waves, passing, through, different, environments, experience, reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction, and, absorption, different, frequencies, experience, different, combinations, of, these, phenomena, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, making, certain, radio, bands, more, useful, for, specific, purposes, than, others, practical, radio, systems, mainly, use, three, different, techniques, of, radio, propagation, to, communicate, at, microwave, frequencies, atmospheric, gases, begin, absorbing, radio, waves, so, the, range, of, practical, radio, communication, systems, decreases, with, increasing, frequency, below, about, 20, ghz, atmospheric, attenuation, is, mainly, due, to, water, vapor, above, 20, ghz, in, the, millimeter, wave, band, other, atmospheric, gases, begin, to, absorb, the, waves, limiting, practical, transmission, distances, to, a, kilometer, or, less, above, 300, ghz, in, the, terahertz, band, virtually, all, the, power, is, absorbed, within, a, few, meters, so, the, atmosphere, is, effectively, opaque, in, radio, communication, systems, information, is, transported, across, space, using, radio, waves, at, the, sending, end, the, information, to, be, sent, in, the, form, of, a, time, varying, electrical, signal, is, applied, to, a, radio, transmitter, the, information, called, the, modulation, signal, can, be, an, audio, signal, representing, sound, from, a, microphone, a, video, signal, representing, moving, images, from, a, video, camera, or, a, digital, signal, representing, data, from, a, computer, in, the, transmitter, an, electronic, oscillator, generates, an, alternating, current, oscillating, at, a, radio, frequency, called, the, carrier, wave, because, it, creates, the, radio, waves, that, carry, the, information, through, the, air, the, information, signal, is, used, to, modulate, the, carrier, altering, some, aspect, of, it, encoding, the, information, on, the, carrier, the, modulated, carrier, is, amplified, and, applied, to, an, antenna, the, oscillating, current, pushes, the, electrons, in, the, antenna, back, and, forth, creating, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, which, radiate, the, energy, away, from, the, antenna, as, radio, waves, the, radio, waves, carry, the, information, to, the, receiver, location, at, the, receiver, the, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, of, the, incoming, radio, wave, push, the, electrons, in, the, receiving, antenna, back, and, forth, creating, a, tiny, oscillating, voltage, which, is, a, weaker, replica, of, the, current, in, the, transmitting, antenna, this, voltage, is, applied, to, the, radio, receiver, which, extracts, the, information, signal, the, receiver, first, uses, a, bandpass, filter, to, separate, the, desired, radio, station, s, radio, signal, from, all, the, other, radio, signals, picked, up, by, the, antenna, then, amplifies, the, signal, so, it, is, stronger, then, finally, extracts, the, information, bearing, modulation, signal, in, a, demodulator, the, recovered, signal, is, sent, to, a, loudspeaker, or, earphone, to, produce, sound, or, a, television, display, screen, to, produce, a, visible, image, or, other, devices, a, digital, data, signal, is, applied, to, a, computer, or, microprocessor, which, interacts, with, a, human, user, the, radio, waves, from, many, transmitters, pass, through, the, air, simultaneously, without, interfering, with, each, other, they, can, be, separated, in, the, receiver, because, each, transmitter, s, radio, waves, oscillate, at, a, different, rate, in, other, words, each, transmitter, has, a, different, frequency, measured, in, kilohertz, khz, megahertz, mhz, or, gigahertz, ghz, the, bandpass, filter, in, the, receiver, consists, of, one, or, more, tuned, circuits, which, act, like, a, resonator, similarly, to, a, tuning, fork, the, tuned, circuit, has, a, natural, resonant, frequency, at, which, it, oscillates, the, resonant, frequency, is, set, equal, to, the, frequency, of, the, desired, radio, station, the, oscillating, radio, signal, from, the, desired, station, causes, the, tuned, circuit, to, oscillate, in, sympathy, and, it, passes, the, signal, on, to, the, rest, of, the, receiver, radio, signals, at, other, frequencies, are, blocked, by, the, tuned, circuit, and, not, passed, on, radio, waves, are, non, ionizing, radiation, which, means, they, do, not, have, enough, energy, to, separate, electrons, from, atoms, or, molecules, ionizing, them, or, break, chemical, bonds, causing, chemical, reactions, or, dna, damage, the, main, effect, of, absorption, of, radio, waves, by, materials, is, to, heat, them, similarly, to, the, infrared, waves, radiated, by, sources, of, heat, such, as, a, space, heater, or, wood, fire, the, oscillating, electric, field, of, the, wave, causes, polar, molecules, to, vibrate, back, and, forth, increasing, the, temperature, this, is, how, a, microwave, oven, cooks, food, radio, waves, have, been, applied, to, the, body, for, 100, years, in, the, medical, therapy, of, diathermy, for, deep, heating, of, body, tissue, to, promote, increased, blood, flow, and, healing, more, recently, they, have, been, used, to, create, higher, temperatures, in, hyperthermia, therapy, and, to, kill, cancer, cells, however, unlike, infrared, waves, which, are, mainly, absorbed, at, the, surface, of, objects, and, cause, surface, heating, radio, waves, are, able, to, penetrate, the, surface, and, deposit, their, energy, inside, materials, and, biological, tissues, the, depth, to, which, radio, waves, penetrate, decreases, with, their, frequency, and, also, depends, on, the, material, s, resistivity, and, permittivity, it, is, given, by, a, parameter, called, the, skin, depth, of, the, material, which, is, the, depth, within, which, 63, of, the, energy, is, deposited, for, example, the, 2, 45, ghz, radio, waves, microwaves, in, a, microwave, oven, penetrate, most, foods, approximately, 2, 5, to, 3, 8, cm, looking, into, a, source, of, radio, waves, at, close, range, such, as, the, waveguide, of, a, working, radio, transmitter, can, cause, damage, to, the, lens, of, the, eye, by, heating, a, strong, enough, beam, of, radio, waves, can, penetrate, the, eye, and, heat, the, lens, enough, to, cause, cataracts, since, the, heating, effect, is, in, principle, no, different, from, other, sources, of, heat, most, research, into, possible, health, hazards, of, exposure, to, radio, waves, has, focused, on, nonthermal, effects, whether, radio, waves, have, any, effect, on, tissues, besides, that, caused, by, heating, radiofrequency, electromagnetic, fields, have, been, classified, by, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, as, having, limited, evidence, for, its, effects, on, humans, and, animals, there, is, weak, mechanistic, evidence, of, cancer, risk, via, personal, exposure, to, rf, emf, from, mobile, telephones, radio, waves, can, be, shielded, against, by, a, conductive, metal, sheet, or, screen, an, enclosure, of, sheet, or, screen, is, called, a, faraday, cage, a, metal, screen, shields, against, radio, waves, as, well, as, a, solid, sheet, as, long, as, the, holes, in, the, screen, are, smaller, than, about, 1, 20, of, wavelength, of, the, waves, since, radio, frequency, radiation, has, both, an, electric, and, a, magnetic, component, it, is, often, convenient, to, express, intensity, of, radiation, field, in, terms, of, units, specific, to, each, component, the, unit, volts, per, meter, v, m, is, used, for, the, electric, component, and, the, unit, amperes, per, meter, a, m, is, used, for, the, magnetic, component, one, can, speak, of, an, electromagnetic, field, and, these, units, are, used, to, provide, information, about, the, levels, of, electric, and, magnetic, field, strength, at, a, measurement, location, another, commonly, used, unit, for, characterizing, an, rf, electromagnetic, field, is, power, density, power, density, is, most, accurately, used, when, the, point, of, measurement, is, far, enough, away, from, the, rf, emitter, to, be, located, in, what, is, referred, to, as, the, far, field, zone, of, the, radiation, pattern, in, closer, proximity, to, the, transmitter, i, e, in, the, near, field, zone, the, physical, relationships, between, the, electric, and, magnetic, components, of, the, field, can, be, complex, and, it, is, best, to, use, the, field, strength, units, discussed, above, power, density, is, measured, in, terms, of, power, per, unit, area, for, example, with, the, unit, milliwatt, per, square, centimeter, mw, cm, 2, when, speaking, of, frequencies, in, the, microwave, range, and, higher, power, density, is, usually, used, to, express, intensity, since, exposures, that, might, occur, would, likely, be, in, the, far, field, zone, elf, 3, hz, 100, mm, 30, hz, 10, mm, slf, 30, hz, 10, mm, 300, hz, 1, mm, ulf, 300, hz, 1, mm, 3, khz, 100, km, vlf, 3, khz, 100, km, 30, khz, 10, km, lf,
