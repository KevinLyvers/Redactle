frequency, symbol, f, most, often, measured, in, hertz, symbol, hz, is, the, number, of, occurrences, of, a, repeating, event, per, unit, of, time, it, is, also, occasionally, referred, to, as, temporal, frequency, for, clarity, and, to, distinguish, it, from, spatial, frequency, ordinary, frequency, is, related, to, angular, frequency, symbol, with, si, unit, radian, per, second, by, a, factor, of, 2, the, period, symbol, t, is, the, interval, of, time, between, events, so, the, period, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, frequency, t, 1, f, frequency, is, an, important, parameter, used, in, science, and, engineering, to, specify, the, rate, of, oscillatory, and, vibratory, phenomena, such, as, mechanical, vibrations, audio, signals, sound, radio, waves, and, light, for, example, if, a, heart, beats, at, a, frequency, of, 120, times, per, minute, 2, hertz, the, period, the, interval, between, beats, is, half, a, second, 60, seconds, divided, by, 120, beats, for, cyclical, phenomena, such, as, oscillations, waves, or, for, examples, of, simple, harmonic, motion, the, term, frequency, is, defined, as, the, number, of, cycles, or, repetitions, per, unit, of, time, the, conventional, symbol, for, frequency, is, f, or, the, greek, letter, nu, is, also, used, the, period, t, is, the, time, taken, to, complete, one, cycle, of, an, oscillation, or, rotation, the, frequency, and, the, period, are, related, by, the, equation, f, 1, t, displaystyle, f, frac, 1, t, the, term, temporal, frequency, is, used, to, emphasise, that, the, frequency, is, characterised, by, the, number, of, occurrences, of, a, repeating, event, per, unit, time, the, si, unit, of, frequency, is, the, hertz, hz, named, after, the, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, in, 1930, it, was, adopted, by, the, cgpm, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, in, 1960, officially, replacing, the, previous, name, cycle, per, second, cps, the, si, unit, for, the, period, as, for, all, measurements, of, time, is, the, second, a, traditional, unit, of, frequency, used, with, rotating, mechanical, devices, where, it, is, termed, rotational, frequency, is, revolution, per, minute, abbreviated, r, min, or, rpm, 60, rpm, is, equivalent, to, one, hertz, as, a, matter, of, convenience, longer, and, slower, waves, such, as, ocean, surface, waves, are, more, typically, described, by, wave, period, rather, than, frequency, short, and, fast, waves, like, audio, and, radio, are, usually, described, by, their, frequency, some, commonly, used, conversions, are, listed, below, for, periodic, waves, in, nondispersive, media, that, is, media, in, which, the, wave, speed, is, independent, of, frequency, frequency, has, an, inverse, relationship, to, the, wavelength, lambda, even, in, dispersive, media, the, frequency, f, of, a, sinusoidal, wave, is, equal, to, the, phase, velocity, v, of, the, wave, divided, by, the, wavelength, of, the, wave, f, v, displaystyle, f, frac, v, lambda, in, the, special, case, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, vacuum, then, v, c, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, and, this, expression, becomes, f, c, displaystyle, f, frac, c, lambda, when, monochromatic, waves, travel, from, one, medium, to, another, their, frequency, remains, the, same, only, their, wavelength, and, speed, change, measurement, of, frequency, can, be, done, in, the, following, ways, calculating, the, frequency, of, a, repeating, event, is, accomplished, by, counting, the, number, of, times, that, event, occurs, within, a, specific, time, period, then, dividing, the, count, by, the, period, for, example, if, 71, events, occur, within, 15, seconds, the, frequency, is, f, 71, 15, s, 4, 73, hz, displaystyle, f, frac, 71, 15, text, s, approx, 4, 73, text, hz, if, the, number, of, counts, is, not, very, large, it, is, more, accurate, to, measure, the, time, interval, for, a, predetermined, number, of, occurrences, rather, than, the, number, of, occurrences, within, a, specified, time, the, latter, method, introduces, a, random, error, into, the, count, of, between, zero, and, one, count, so, on, average, half, a, count, this, is, called, gating, error, and, causes, an, average, error, in, the, calculated, frequency, of, f, 1, 2, t, m, textstyle, delta, f, frac, 1, 2t, text, m, or, a, fractional, error, of, f, f, 1, 2, f, t, m, textstyle, frac, delta, f, f, frac, 1, 2ft, text, m, where, t, m, displaystyle, t, text, m, is, the, timing, interval, and, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, measured, frequency, this, error, decreases, with, frequency, so, it, is, generally, a, problem, at, low, frequencies, where, the, number, of, counts, n, is, small, an, old, method, of, measuring, the, frequency, of, rotating, or, vibrating, objects, is, to, use, a, stroboscope, this, is, an, intense, repetitively, flashing, light, strobe, light, whose, frequency, can, be, adjusted, with, a, calibrated, timing, circuit, the, strobe, light, is, pointed, at, the, rotating, object, and, the, frequency, adjusted, up, and, down, when, the, frequency, of, the, strobe, equals, the, frequency, of, the, rotating, or, vibrating, object, the, object, completes, one, cycle, of, oscillation, and, returns, to, its, original, position, between, the, flashes, of, light, so, when, illuminated, by, the, strobe, the, object, appears, stationary, then, the, frequency, can, be, read, from, the, calibrated, readout, on, the, stroboscope, a, downside, of, this, method, is, that, an, object, rotating, at, an, integer, multiple, of, the, strobing, frequency, will, also, appear, stationary, higher, frequencies, are, usually, measured, with, a, frequency, counter, this, is, an, electronic, instrument, which, measures, the, frequency, of, an, applied, repetitive, electronic, signal, and, displays, the, result, in, hertz, on, a, digital, display, it, uses, digital, logic, to, count, the, number, of, cycles, during, a, time, interval, established, by, a, precision, quartz, time, base, cyclic, processes, that, are, not, electrical, such, as, the, rotation, rate, of, a, shaft, mechanical, vibrations, or, sound, waves, can, be, converted, to, a, repetitive, electronic, signal, by, transducers, and, the, signal, applied, to, a, frequency, counter, as, of, 2018, frequency, counters, can, cover, the, range, up, to, about, 100, ghz, this, represents, the, limit, of, direct, counting, methods, frequencies, above, this, must, be, measured, by, indirect, methods, above, the, range, of, frequency, counters, frequencies, of, electromagnetic, signals, are, often, measured, indirectly, utilizing, heterodyning, frequency, conversion, a, reference, signal, of, a, known, frequency, near, the, unknown, frequency, is, mixed, with, the, unknown, frequency, in, a, nonlinear, mixing, device, such, as, a, diode, this, creates, a, heterodyne, or, beat, signal, at, the, difference, between, the, two, frequencies, if, the, two, signals, are, close, together, in, frequency, the, heterodyne, is, low, enough, to, be, measured, by, a, frequency, counter, this, process, only, measures, the, difference, between, the, unknown, frequency, and, the, reference, frequency, to, convert, higher, frequencies, several, stages, of, heterodyning, can, be, used, current, research, is, extending, this, method, to, infrared, and, light, frequencies, optical, heterodyne, detection, visible, light, is, an, electromagnetic, wave, consisting, of, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, traveling, through, space, the, frequency, of, the, wave, determines, its, color, 400, thz, 4, 10, 14, hz, is, red, light, 800, thz, 8, 10, 14, hz, is, violet, light, and, between, these, in, the, range, 400, 800, thz, are, all, the, other, colors, of, the, visible, spectrum, an, electromagnetic, wave, with, a, frequency, less, than, 4, 10, 14, hz, will, be, invisible, to, the, human, eye, such, waves, are, called, infrared, ir, radiation, at, even, lower, frequency, the, wave, is, called, a, microwave, and, at, still, lower, frequencies, it, is, called, a, radio, wave, likewise, an, electromagnetic, wave, with, a, frequency, higher, than, 8, 10, 14, hz, will, also, be, invisible, to, the, human, eye, such, waves, are, called, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, even, higher, frequency, waves, are, called, x, rays, and, higher, still, are, gamma, rays, all, of, these, waves, from, the, lowest, frequency, radio, waves, to, the, highest, frequency, gamma, rays, are, fundamentally, the, same, and, they, are, all, called, electromagnetic, radiation, they, all, travel, through, vacuum, at, the, same, speed, the, speed, of, light, giving, them, wavelengths, inversely, proportional, to, their, frequencies, c, f, displaystyle, displaystyle, c, f, lambda, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, c, in, vacuum, or, less, in, other, media, f, is, the, frequency, and, is, the, wavelength, in, dispersive, media, such, as, glass, the, speed, depends, somewhat, on, frequency, so, the, wavelength, is, not, quite, inversely, proportional, to, frequency, sound, propagates, as, mechanical, vibration, waves, of, pressure, and, displacement, in, air, or, other, substances, in, general, frequency, components, of, a, sound, determine, its, color, its, timbre, when, speaking, about, the, frequency, in, singular, of, a, sound, it, means, the, property, that, most, determines, its, pitch, the, frequencies, an, ear, can, hear, are, limited, to, a, specific, range, of, frequencies, the, audible, frequency, range, for, humans, is, typically, given, as, being, between, about, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, 20, khz, though, the, high, frequency, limit, usually, reduces, with, age, other, species, have, different, hearing, ranges, for, example, some, dog, breeds, can, perceive, vibrations, up, to, 60, 000, hz, in, many, media, such, as, air, the, speed, of, sound, is, approximately, independent, of, frequency, so, the, wavelength, of, the, sound, waves, distance, between, repetitions, is, approximately, inversely, proportional, to, frequency, in, europe, africa, australia, southern, south, america, most, of, asia, and, russia, the, frequency, of, the, alternating, current, in, household, electrical, outlets, is, 50, hz, close, to, the, tone, g, whereas, in, north, america, and, northern, south, america, the, frequency, of, the, alternating, current, in, household, electrical, outlets, is, 60, hz, between, the, tones, b, and, b, that, is, a, minor, third, above, the, european, frequency, the, frequency, of, the, hum, in, an, audio, recording, can, show, in, which, of, these, general, regions, the, recording, was, made, aperiodic, frequency, is, the, rate, of, incidence, or, occurrence, of, non, cyclic, phenomena, including, random, processes, such, as, radioactive, decay, it, is, expressed, with, the, unit, reciprocal, second, s, 1, or, in, the, case, of, radioactivity, with, the, unit, becquerel, it, is, defined, as, a, rate, f, n, t, involving, the, number, of, entities, counted, or, the, number, of, events, happened, n, during, a, given, time, duration, t, it, is, a, physical, quantity, of, type, temporal, rate
