boric, acid, more, specifically, orthoboric, acid, is, a, compound, of, boron, oxygen, and, hydrogen, with, formula, b, oh, 3, it, may, also, be, called, hydrogen, orthoborate, trihydroxidoboron, or, boracic, acid, it, is, usually, encountered, as, colorless, crystals, or, a, white, powder, that, dissolves, in, water, and, occurs, in, nature, as, the, mineral, sassolite, it, is, a, weak, acid, that, yields, various, borate, anions, and, salts, and, can, react, with, alcohols, to, form, borate, esters, boric, acid, is, often, used, as, an, antiseptic, insecticide, flame, retardant, neutron, absorber, or, precursor, to, other, boron, compounds, the, term, boric, acid, is, also, used, generically, for, any, oxoacid, of, boron, such, as, metaboric, acid, hbo, 2, and, tetraboric, acid, h, 2, b, 4, o, 7, orthoboric, acid, was, first, prepared, by, wilhelm, homberg, 1652, 1715, from, borax, by, the, action, of, mineral, acids, and, was, given, the, name, sal, sedativum, hombergi, sedative, salt, of, homberg, however, boric, acid, and, borates, have, been, used, since, the, time, of, the, ancient, greeks, for, cleaning, preserving, food, and, other, activities, the, three, oxygen, atoms, form, a, trigonal, planar, geometry, around, the, boron, the, b, o, bond, length, is, 136, pm, and, the, o, h, is, 97, pm, the, molecular, point, group, is, c, 3h, two, crystalline, forms, of, orthoboric, acid, are, known, triclinic, with, space, group, p, 1, and, trigonal, with, space, group, p3, 2, the, former, is, the, most, common, the, second, which, is, a, bit, more, stable, thermodynamically, can, be, obtained, with, a, special, preparation, method, the, triclinic, form, of, boric, acid, consists, of, layers, of, b, oh, 3, molecules, held, together, by, hydrogen, bonds, with, an, o, o, separation, of, 272, pm, the, distance, between, two, adjacent, layers, is, 318, pm, while, the, layers, of, the, triclinic, phase, are, nearly, trigonal, with, 119, 76, a, 701, 87, pm, and, b, 703, 5, pm, compared, to, a, 704, 53, 4, pm, for, the, trigonal, form, the, stacking, of, the, layers, is, somewhat, offset, in, the, triclinic, phase, with, 92, 49, and, 101, 46, the, triclinic, phase, has, c, 634, 72, pm, and, the, trigonal, one, has, a, 956, 08, 7, pm, boric, acid, may, be, prepared, by, reacting, borax, sodium, tetraborate, decahydrate, with, a, mineral, acid, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, it, is, also, formed, as, a, by, product, of, hydrolysis, of, boron, trihalides, and, diborane, when, heated, orthoboric, acid, undergoes, a, three, step, dehydration, the, reported, transition, temperatures, vary, substantially, from, source, to, source, when, heated, above, 140, c, orthoboric, acid, yields, metaboric, acid, hbo, 2, with, loss, of, one, water, molecule, heating, metaboric, acid, above, about, 180, c, eliminates, another, water, molecule, forming, tetraboric, acid, also, called, pyroboric, acid, h, 2, b, 4, o, 7, further, heating, to, about, 530, c, leads, to, boron, trioxide, when, orthoboric, acid, is, dissolved, in, water, it, partially, dissociates, to, give, metaboric, acid, the, solution, is, mildly, acidic, due, to, ionization, of, the, acids, however, raman, spectroscopy, of, strongly, alkaline, solutions, has, shown, the, presence, of, ions, leading, some, to, conclude, that, the, acidity, is, exclusively, due, to, the, abstraction, of, oh, from, water, equivalently, or, more, properly, this, reaction, occurs, in, two, steps, with, the, neutral, complex, aquatrihydroxyboron, b, oh, 3, oh, 2, as, an, intermediate, this, reaction, may, be, characterized, as, lewis, acidity, of, boron, toward, ho, rather, than, as, br, nsted, acidity, however, some, of, its, behaviour, towards, some, chemical, reactions, suggest, it, to, be, a, tribasic, acid, in, the, br, nsted, lowry, sense, as, well, boric, acid, mixed, with, borax, na, 2, b, 4, o, 7, 10h, 2, o, more, properly, na, 2, b, 4, o, 5, oh, 4, 8h, 2, o, in, the, weight, ratio, of, 4, 5, is, highly, soluble, in, water, though, they, are, not, so, soluble, separately, boric, acid, also, dissolves, in, anhydrous, sulfuric, acid, according, to, the, equation, the, product, is, an, extremely, strong, acid, even, stronger, than, the, original, sulfuric, acid, boric, acid, reacts, with, alcohols, to, form, borate, esters, b, or, 3, where, r, is, alkyl, or, aryl, the, reaction, is, typically, driven, by, a, dehydrating, agent, such, as, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, the, acidity, of, boric, acid, solutions, is, greatly, increased, in, the, presence, of, cis, vicinal, diols, organic, compounds, containing, similarly, oriented, hydroxyl, groups, in, adjacent, carbon, atoms, r, 1, r, 2, c, oh, c, oh, r, 3, r, 4, such, as, glycerol, and, mannitol, the, tetrahydroxyborate, anion, formed, in, the, dissolution, spontaneously, reacts, with, these, diols, to, form, relatively, stable, anion, esters, containing, one, or, two, five, member, b, o, c, c, o, rings, for, example, the, reaction, with, mannitol, h, hcoh, 6, h, whose, two, middle, hydroxyls, are, in, cis, orientation, can, be, written, as, giving, the, overall, reaction, the, stability, of, these, mannitoborate, ester, anions, shifts, the, equilibrium, of, the, right, and, thus, increases, the, acidity, of, the, solution, by, 5, orders, of, magnitude, compared, to, that, of, pure, boric, oxide, lowering, the, p, k, a, from, 9, to, below, 4, for, sufficient, concentration, of, mannitol, the, resulting, solution, has, been, called, mannitoboric, acid, the, addition, of, mannitol, to, an, initially, neutral, solution, containing, boric, acid, or, simple, borates, lowers, its, ph, enough, for, it, to, be, titrated, by, a, strong, base, as, naoh, including, with, an, automated, a, potentiometric, titrator, this, property, is, used, in, analytical, chemistry, to, determine, the, borate, content, of, aqueous, solutions, for, example, to, monitor, the, depletion, of, boric, acid, by, neutrons, in, the, water, of, the, primary, circuit, of, light, water, reactor, when, the, compound, is, added, as, a, neutron, poison, during, refueling, operations, based, on, mammalian, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, rating, of, 2, 660, mg, kg, body, mass, boric, acid, is, only, poisonous, if, taken, internally, or, inhaled, in, large, quantities, the, fourteenth, edition, of, the, merck, index, indicates, that, the, ld, 50, of, boric, acid, is, 5, 14, g, kg, for, oral, dosages, given, to, rats, and, that, 5, to, 20, g, kg, has, produced, death, in, adult, humans, for, a, 70, kg, adult, at, the, lower, 5, g, kg, limit, 350, g, could, produce, death, in, humans, for, comparison, s, sake, the, ld, 50, of, salt, is, reported, to, be, 3, 75, g, kg, in, rats, according, to, the, merck, index, according, to, the, agency, for, toxic, substances, and, disease, registry, the, minimal, lethal, dose, of, ingested, boron, as, boric, acid, was, reported, to, be, 2, 3, g, in, infants, 5, 6, g, in, children, and, 15, 20, g, in, adults, however, a, review, of, 784, human, poisonings, with, boric, acid, 10, 88, g, reported, no, fatalities, with, 88, of, cases, being, asymptomatic, long, term, exposure, to, boric, acid, may, be, of, more, concern, causing, kidney, damage, and, eventually, kidney, failure, see, links, below, although, it, does, not, appear, to, be, carcinogenic, studies, in, dogs, have, reported, testicular, atrophy, after, exposure, to, 32, mg, kg, day, for, 90, days, this, level, were, it, applicable, to, humans, at, like, dose, would, equate, to, a, cumulative, dose, of, 202, g, over, 90, days, for, a, 70, kg, adult, not, far, lower, than, the, above, ld, 50, according, to, the, clh, report, for, boric, acid, published, by, the, bureau, for, chemical, substances, lodz, poland, boric, acid, in, high, doses, shows, significant, developmental, toxicity, and, teratogenicity, in, rabbit, rat, and, mouse, fetuses, as, well, as, cardiovascular, defects, skeletal, variations, and, mild, kidney, lesions, as, a, consequence, in, the, 30th, atp, to, eu, directive, 67, 548, eec, of, august, 2008, the, european, commission, decided, to, amend, its, classification, as, reprotoxic, category, 2, and, to, apply, the, risk, phrases, r60, may, impair, fertility, and, r61, may, cause, harm, to, the, unborn, child, at, a, 2010, european, diagnostics, manufacturing, association, edma, meeting, several, new, additions, to, the, substance, of, very, high, concern, svhc, candidate, list, in, relation, to, the, registration, evaluation,

treat, some, kinds, of, otitis, externa, ear, infection, in, both, humans, and, animals, the, preservative, in, urine, sample, bottles, in, the, uk, is, boric, acid, boric, acid, solutions, used, as, an, eye, wash, or, on, abraded, skin, are, known, to, be, toxic, particularly, to, infants, especially, after, repeated, use, this, is, because, of, its, slow, elimination, rate, boric, acid, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, substances, that, can, counteract, the, harmful, effects, of, reactive, hydrofluoric, acid, hf, after, an, accidental, contact, with, the, skin, it, works, by, forcing, the, free, f, anions, into, the, inert, tetrafluoroborate, anion, this, process, defeats, the, extreme, toxicity, of, hydrofluoric, acid, particularly, its, ability, to, sequester, ionic, calcium, from, blood, serum, which, can, lead, to, cardiac, arrest, and, bone, decomposition, such, an, event, can, occur, from, just, minor, skin, contact, with, hf, boric, acid, was, first, registered, in, the, us, as, an, insecticide, in, 1948, for, control, of, cockroaches, termites, fire, ants, fleas, silverfish, and, many, other, insects, the, product, is, generally, considered, to, be, safe, to, use, in, household, kitchens, to, control, cockroaches, and, ants, it, acts, as, a, stomach, poison, affecting, the, insects, metabolism, and, the, dry, powder, is, abrasive, to, the, insects, exoskeletons, boric, acid, also, has, the, reputation, as, the, gift, that, keeps, on, killing, in, that, cockroaches, that, cross, over, lightly, dusted, areas, do, not, die, immediately, but, that, the, effect, is, like, shards, of, glass, cutting, them, apart, this, often, allows, a, roach, to, go, back, to, the, nest, where, it, soon, dies, cockroaches, being, cannibalistic, eat, others, killed, by, contact, or, consumption, of, boric, acid, consuming, the, powder, trapped, in, the, dead, roach, and, killing, them, too, in, combination, with, its, use, as, an, insecticide, boric, acid, also, prevents, and, destroys, existing, wet, and, dry, rot, in, timbers, it, can, be, used, in, combination, with, an, ethylene, glycol, carrier, to, treat, external, wood, against, fungal, and, insect, attack, it, is, possible, to, buy, borate, impregnated, rods, for, insertion, into, wood, via, drill, holes, where, dampness, and, moisture, is, known, to, collect, and, sit, it, is, available, in, a, gel, form, and, injectable, paste, form, for, treating, rot, affected, wood, without, the, need, to, replace, the, timber, concentrates, of, borate, based, treatments, can, be, used, to, prevent, slime, mycelium, and, algae, growth, even, in, marine, environments, boric, acid, is, added, to, salt, in, the, curing, of, cattle, hides, calfskins, and, sheepskins, this, helps, to, control, bacterial, development, and, helps, to, control, insects, boric, acid, in, equilibrium, with, its, conjugate, base, the, borate, ion, is, widely, used, in, the, concentration, range, 50, 100, ppm, boron, equivalents, as, a, primary, or, adjunct, ph, buffer, system, in, swimming, pools, boric, acid, is, a, weak, acid, with, p, k, a, the, ph, at, which, buffering, is, strongest, because, the, free, acid, and, borate, ion, are, in, equal, concentrations, of, 9, 24, in, pure, water, at, 25, c, but, apparent, p, k, a, is, substantially, lower, in, swimming, pool, or, ocean, waters, because, of, interactions, with, various, other, molecules, in, solution, it, will, be, around, 9, 0, in, a, salt, water, pool, no, matter, which, form, of, soluble, boron, is, added, within, the, acceptable, range, of, ph, and, boron, concentration, for, swimming, pools, boric, acid, is, the, predominant, form, in, aqueous, solution, as, shown, in, the, accompanying, figure, the, boric, acid, borate, system, can, be, useful, as, a, primary, buffer, system, substituting, for, the, bicarbonate, system, with, p, k, a, 1, 6, 0, and, p, k, a, 2, 9, 4, under, typical, salt, water, pool, conditions, in, pools, with, salt, water, chlorine, generators, that, tend, to, show, upward, drift, in, ph, from, a, working, range, of, ph, 7, 5, 8, 2, buffer, capacity, is, greater, against, rising, ph, towards, the, pka, around, 9, 0, as, illustrated, in, the, accompanying, graph, the, use, of, boric, acid, in, this, concentration, range, does, not, allow, any, reduction, in, free, hocl, concentration, needed, for, pool, sanitation, but, it, may, add, marginally, to, the, photo, protective, effects, of, cyanuric, acid, and, confer, other, benefits, through, anti, corrosive, activity, or, perceived, water, softness, depending, on, overall, pool, solute, composition, colloidal, suspensions, of, nanoparticles, of, boric, acid, dissolved, in, petroleum, or, vegetable, oil, can, form, a, remarkable, lubricant, on, ceramic, or, metal, surfaces, with, a, coefficient, of, sliding, friction, that, decreases, with, increasing, pressure, to, a, value, ranging, from, 0, 10, to, 0, 02, self, lubricating, b, oh, 3, films, result, from, a, spontaneous, chemical, reaction, between, water, molecules, and, b, 2, o, 3, coatings, in, a, humid, environment, in, bulk, scale, an, inverse, relationship, exists, between, friction, coefficient, and, hertzian, contact, pressure, induced, by, applied, load, boric, acid, is, used, to, lubricate, carrom, and, novuss, boards, allowing, for, faster, play, boric, acid, is, used, in, some, nuclear, power, plants, as, a, neutron, poison, the, boron, in, boric, acid, reduces, the, probability, of, thermal, fission, by, absorbing, some, thermal, neutrons, fission, chain, reactions, are, generally, driven, by, the, probability, that, free, neutrons, will, result, in, fission, and, is, determined, by, the, material, and, geometric, properties, of, the, reactor, natural, boron, consists, of, approximately, 20, boron, 10, and, 80, boron, 11, isotopes, boron, 10, has, a, high, cross, section, for, absorption, of, low, energy, thermal, neutrons, by, increasing, boric, acid, concentration, in, the, reactor, coolant, the, probability, that, a, neutron, will, cause, fission, is, reduced, changes, in, boric, acid, concentration, can, effectively, regulate, the, rate, of, fission, taking, place, in, the, reactor, during, normal, at, power, operation, boric, acid, is, used, only, in, pressurized, water, reactors, pwrs, whereas, boiling, water, reactors, bwrs, employ, control, rod, pattern, and, coolant, flow, for, power, control, although, bwrs, can, use, an, aqueous, solution, of, boric, acid, and, borax, or, sodium, pentaborate, for, an, emergency, shutdown, system, if, the, control, rods, fail, to, insert, boric, acid, may, be, dissolved, in, spent, fuel, pools, used, to, store, spent, fuel, elements, the, concentration, is, high, enough, to, keep, neutron, multiplication, at, a, minimum, boric, acid, was, dumped, over, reactor, 4, of, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, after, its, meltdown, to, prevent, another, reaction, from, occurring, boron, is, used, in, pyrotechnics, to, prevent, the, amide, forming, reaction, between, aluminium, and, nitrates, a, small, amount, of, boric, acid, is, added, to, the, composition, to, neutralize, alkaline, amides, that, can, react, with, the, aluminium, boric, acid, can, be, used, as, a, colorant, to, make, fire, green, for, example, when, dissolved, in, methanol, it, is, popularly, used, by, fire, jugglers, and, fire, spinners, to, create, a, deep, green, flame, much, stronger, than, copper, sulfate, boric, acid, is, used, to, treat, or, prevent, boron, deficiencies, in, plants, it, is, also, used, in, preservation, of, grains, such, as, rice, and, wheat
