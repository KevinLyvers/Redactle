copper, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cu, from, latin, cuprum, and, atomic, number, 29, it, is, a, soft, malleable, and, ductile, metal, with, very, high, thermal, and, electrical, conductivity, a, freshly, exposed, surface, of, pure, copper, has, a, pinkish, orange, color, copper, is, used, as, a, conductor, of, heat, and, electricity, as, a, building, material, and, as, a, constituent, of, various, metal, alloys, such, as, sterling, silver, used, in, jewelry, cupronickel, used, to, make, marine, hardware, and, coins, and, constantan, used, in, strain, gauges, and, thermocouples, for, temperature, measurement, copper, is, one, of, the, few, metals, that, can, occur, in, nature, in, a, directly, usable, metallic, form, native, metals, this, led, to, very, early, human, use, in, several, regions, from, c, 8000, bc, thousands, of, years, later, it, was, the, first, metal, to, be, smelted, from, sulfide, ores, c, 5000, bc, the, first, metal, to, be, cast, into, a, shape, in, a, mold, c, 4000, bc, and, the, first, metal, to, be, purposely, alloyed, with, another, metal, tin, to, create, bronze, c, 3500, bc, commonly, encountered, compounds, are, copper, ii, salts, which, often, impart, blue, or, green, colors, to, such, minerals, as, azurite, malachite, and, turquoise, and, have, been, used, widely, and, historically, as, pigments, copper, used, in, buildings, usually, for, roofing, oxidizes, to, form, a, green, patina, of, compounds, called, verdigris, copper, is, sometimes, used, in, decorative, art, both, in, its, elemental, metal, form, and, in, compounds, as, pigments, copper, compounds, are, used, as, bacteriostatic, agents, fungicides, and, wood, preservatives, copper, is, essential, to, all, living, organisms, as, a, trace, dietary, mineral, because, it, is, a, key, constituent, of, the, respiratory, enzyme, complex, cytochrome, c, oxidase, in, molluscs, and, crustaceans, copper, is, a, constituent, of, the, blood, pigment, hemocyanin, replaced, by, the, iron, complexed, hemoglobin, in, fish, and, other, vertebrates, in, humans, copper, is, found, mainly, in, the, liver, muscle, and, bone, the, adult, body, contains, between, 1, 4, and, 2, 1, mg, of, copper, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, in, the, roman, era, copper, was, mined, principally, on, cyprus, the, origin, of, the, name, of, the, metal, from, aes, cyprium, metal, of, cyprus, later, corrupted, to, cuprum, latin, coper, old, english, and, copper, were, derived, from, this, the, later, spelling, first, used, around, 1530, copper, silver, and, gold, are, in, group, 11, of, the, periodic, table, these, three, metals, have, one, s, orbital, electron, on, top, of, a, filled, d, electron, shell, and, are, characterized, by, high, ductility, and, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, the, filled, d, shells, in, these, elements, contribute, little, to, interatomic, interactions, which, are, dominated, by, the, s, electrons, through, metallic, bonds, unlike, metals, with, incomplete, d, shells, metallic, bonds, in, copper, are, lacking, a, covalent, character, and, are, relatively, weak, this, observation, explains, the, low, hardness, and, high, ductility, of, single, crystals, of, copper, at, the, macroscopic, scale, introduction, of, extended, defects, to, the, crystal, lattice, such, as, grain, boundaries, hinders, flow, of, the, material, under, applied, stress, thereby, increasing, its, hardness, for, this, reason, copper, is, usually, supplied, in, a, fine, grained, polycrystalline, form, which, has, greater, strength, than, monocrystalline, forms, the, softness, of, copper, partly, explains, its, high, electrical, conductivity, 59, 6, 10, 6, s, m, and, high, thermal, conductivity, second, highest, second, only, to, silver, among, pure, metals, at, room, temperature, this, is, because, the, resistivity, to, electron, transport, in, metals, at, room, temperature, originates, primarily, from, scattering, of, electrons, on, thermal, vibrations, of, the, lattice, which, are, relatively, weak, in, a, soft, metal, the, maximum, possible, current, density, of, copper, in, open, air, is, approximately, 3, 1, 10, 6, a, m, 2, above, which, it, begins, to, heat, excessively, copper, is, one, of, a, few, metallic, elements, with, a, natural, color, other, than, gray, or, silver, pure, copper, is, orange, red, and, acquires, a, reddish, tarnish, when, exposed, to, air, this, is, due, to, the, low, plasma, frequency, of, the, metal, which, lies, in, the, red, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, causing, it, to, absorb, the, higher, frequency, green, and, blue, colors, as, with, other, metals, if, copper, is, put, in, contact, with, another, metal, in, the, presence, of, an, electrolyte, galvanic, corrosion, will, occur, copper, does, not, react, with, water, but, it, does, slowly, react, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, form, a, layer, of, brown, black, copper, oxide, which, unlike, the, rust, that, forms, on, iron, in, moist, air, protects, the, underlying, metal, from, further, corrosion, passivation, a, green, layer, of, verdigris, copper, carbonate, can, often, be, seen, on, old, copper, structures, such, as, the, roofing, of, many, older, buildings, and, the, statue, of, liberty, copper, tarnishes, when, exposed, to, some, sulfur, compounds, with, which, it, reacts, to, form, various, copper, sulfides, there, are, 29, isotopes, of, copper, 63, cu, and, 65, cu, are, stable, with, 63, cu, comprising, approximately, 69, of, naturally, occurring, copper, both, have, a, spin, of, 3, 2, the, other, isotopes, are, radioactive, with, the, most, stable, being, 67, cu, with, a, half, life, of, 61, 83, hours, seven, metastable, isomers, have, been, characterized, 68m, cu, is, the, longest, lived, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 8, minutes, isotopes, with, a, mass, number, above, 64, decay, by, whereas, those, with, a, mass, number, below, 64, decay, by, 64, cu, which, has, a, half, life, of, 12, 7, hours, decays, both, ways, 62, cu, and, 64, cu, have, significant, applications, 62, cu, is, used, in, 62, cu, cu, ptsm, as, a, radioactive, tracer, for, positron, emission, tomography, copper, is, produced, in, massive, stars, and, is, present, in, the, earth, s, crust, in, a, proportion, of, about, 50, parts, per, million, ppm, in, nature, copper, occurs, in, a, variety, of, minerals, including, native, copper, copper, sulfides, such, as, chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite, covellite, and, chalcocite, copper, sulfosalts, such, as, tetrahedite, tennantite, and, enargite, copper, carbonates, such, as, azurite, and, malachite, and, as, copper, i, or, copper, ii, oxides, such, as, cuprite, and, tenorite, respectively, the, largest, mass, of, elemental, copper, discovered, weighed, 420, tonnes, and, was, found, in, 1857, on, the, keweenaw, peninsula, in, michigan, us, native, copper, is, a, polycrystal, with, the, largest, single, crystal, ever, described, measuring, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, cm, copper, is, the, 26th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, representing, 50, ppm, compared, with, 75, ppm, for, zinc, and, 14, ppm, for, lead, typical, background, concentrations, of, copper, do, not, exceed, 1, ng, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 150, mg, kg, in, soil, 30, mg, kg, in, vegetation, 2, g, l, in, freshwater, and, 0, 5, g, l, in, seawater, most, copper, is, mined, or, extracted, as, copper, sulfides, from, large, open, pit, mines, in, porphyry, copper, deposits, that, contain, 0, 4, to, 1, 0, copper, sites, include, chuquicamata, in, chile, bingham, canyon, mine, in, utah, united, states, and, el, chino, mine, in, new, mexico, united, states, according, to, the, british, geological, survey, in, 2005, chile, was, the, top, producer, of, copper, with, at, least, one, third, of, the, world, share, followed, by, the, united, states, indonesia, and, peru, copper, can, also, be, recovered, through, the, in, situ, leach, process, several, sites, in, the, state, of, arizona, are, considered, prime, candidates, for, this, method, the, amount, of, copper, in, use, is, increasing, and, the, quantity, available, is, barely, sufficient, to, allow, all, countries, to, reach, developed, world, levels, of, usage, an, alternative, source, of, copper, for, collection, currently, being, researched, are, polymetallic, nodules, which, are, located, at, the, depths, of, the, pacific, ocean, approximately, 3000, 6500, meters, below, sea, level, these, nodules, contain, other, valuable, metals, such, as, cobalt, and, nickel, copper, has, been, in, use, for, at, least, 10, 000, years, but, more, than, 95, of, all, copper, ever, mined, and, smelted, has, been, extracted, since, 1900, as, with, many, natural, resources, the, total, amount, of, copper, on, earth, is, vast, with, around, 10, 14, tons, in, the, top, kilometer, of, earth, s, crust, which, is, about, 5, million, years, worth, at, the, current, rate, of, extraction, however, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, these, reserves, is, economically, viable, with, present, day, prices, and, technologies, estimates, of, copper, reserves, available, for, mining, vary, from, 25, to, 60, years, depending, on, core, assumptions, such, as, the, growth, rate, recycling, is, a, major, source, of, copper, in, the, modern, world, the, price, of, copper, is, volatile, after, a, peak, in, 2022, the, price, unexpectedly, fell, the, global, market, for, copper, is, one, of, the, most, commodified, and, financialized, of, the, commodity, markets, and, has, been, so, for, decades, 213, the, great, majority, of, copper, ores, are, sulfides, common, ores, are, the, sulfides, chalcopyrite, cufes, 2, bornite, cu, 5, fes, 4, and, to, a, lesser, extent, covellite, cus, and, chalcocite, cu, 2, s, these, ores, occur, at, the, level, of, 1, cu, concentration, of, the, ore, is, required, which, begins, with, comminution, followed, by, froth, flotation, the, remaining, concentrate, is, the, smelted, which, can, be, described, with, two, simplified, equations, cuprous, oxide, reacts, with, cuprous, sulfide, to, convert, to, blister, copper, upon, heating, this, roasting, gives, matte, copper, roughly, 50, cu, by, weight, which, is, purified, by, electrolysis, depending, on, the, ore, sometimes, other, metals, are, obtained, during, the, electrolysis, including, platinum, and, gold, aside, from, sulfides, another, family, of, ores, are, oxides, approximately, 15, of, the, world, s, copper, supply, derives, from, these, oxides, the, beneficiation, process, for, oxides, involves, extraction, with, sulfuric, acid, solutions, followed, by, electrolysis, in, parallel, with, the, above, method, for, concentrated, sulfide, and, oxide, ores, copper, is, recovered, from, mine, tailings, and, heaps, a, variety, of, methods, are, used, including, leaching, with, sulfuric, acid, ammonia, ferric, chloride, biological, methods, are, also, used, a, significant, source, of, copper, is, from, recycling, recycling, is, facilitated, because, copper, is, usually, deployed, in, its, metallic, state, in, 2001, a, typical, automobile, contained, 20, 30, kg, of, copper, recycling, usually, begins, with, some, melting, process, using, a, blast, furnace, a, potential, source, of, copper, is, polymetallic, nodules, which, have, an, estimated, concentration, 1, 3, like, aluminium, copper, is, recyclable, without, any, loss, of, quality, both, from, raw, state, and, from, manufactured, products, in, volume, copper, is, the, third, most, recycled, metal, after, iron, and, aluminium, an, estimated, 80, of, all, copper, ever, mined, is, still, in, use, today, according, to, the, international, resource, panel, s, metal, stocks, in, society, report, the, global, per, capita, stock, of, copper, in, use, in, society, is, 35, 55, kg, much, of, this, is, in, more, developed, countries, 140, 300, kg, per, capita, rather, than, less, developed, countries, 30, 40, kg, per, capita, the, process, of, recycling, copper, is, roughly, the, same, as, is, used, to, extract, copper, but, requires, fewer, steps, high, purity, scrap, copper, is, melted, in, a, furnace, and, then, reduced, and, cast, into, billets, and, ingots, lower, purity, scrap, is, refined, by, electroplating, in, a, bath, of, sulfuric, acid, the, environmental, cost, of, copper, mining, was, estimated, at, 3, 7, kg, co2eq, per, kg, of, copper, in, 2019, codelco, a, major, producer, in, chile, reported, that, in, 2020, the, company, emitted, 2, 8t, co2eq, per, ton, 2, 8, kg, co2eq, per, kg, of, fine, copper, greenhouse, gas, emissions, primarily, arise, from, electricity, consumed, by, the, company, especially, when, sourced, from, fossil, fuels, and, from, engines, required, for, copper, extraction, and, refinement, companies, that, mine, land, often, mismanage, waste, rendering, the, area, sterile, for, life, additionally, nearby, rivers, and, forests, are, also, negatively, impacted, the, philippines, is, an, example, of, a, region, where, land, is, overexploited, by, mining, companies, copper, mining, waste, in, valea, esei, romania, has, significantly, altered, nearby, water, properties, the, water, in, the, affected, areas, is, highly, acidic, with, a, ph, range, of, 2, 1, 4, 9, and, shows, elevated, electrical, conductivity, levels, between, 280, and, 1561, ms, cm, these, changes, in, water, chemistry, make, the, environment, inhospitable, for, fish, essentially, rendering, the, water, uninhabitable, for, aquatic, life, numerous, copper, alloys, have, been, formulated, many, with, important, uses, brass, is, an, alloy, of, copper, and, zinc, bronze, usually, refers, to, copper, tin, alloys, but, can, refer, to, any, alloy, of, copper, such, as, aluminium, bronze, copper, is, one, of, the, most, important, constituents, of, silver, and, karat, gold, solders, used, in, the, jewelry, industry, modifying, the, color, hardness, and, melting, point, of, the, resulting, alloys, some, lead, free, solders, consist, of, tin, alloyed, with, a, small, proportion, of, copper, and, other, metals, the, alloy, of, copper, and, nickel, called, cupronickel, is, used, in, low, denomination, coins, often, for, the, outer, cladding, the, us, five, cent, coin, currently, called, a, nickel, consists, of, 75, copper, and, 25, nickel, in, homogeneous, composition, prior, to, the, introduction, of, cupronickel, which, was, widely, adopted, by, countries, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, alloys, of, copper, and, silver, were, also, used, with, the, united, states, using, an, alloy, of, 90, silver, and, 10, copper, until, 1965, when, circulating, silver, was, removed, from, all, coins, with, the, exception, of, the, half, dollar, these, were, debased, to, an, alloy, of, 40, silver, and, 60, copper, between, 1965, and, 1970, the, alloy, of, 90, copper, and, 10, nickel, remarkable, for, its, resistance, to, corrosion, is, used, for, various, objects, exposed, to, seawater, though, it, is, vulnerable, to, the, sulfides, sometimes, found, in, polluted, harbors, and, estuaries, alloys, of, copper, with, aluminium, about, 7, have, a, golden, color, and, are, used, in, decorations, shakud, is, a, japanese, decorative, alloy, of, copper, containing, a, low, percentage, of, gold, typically, 4, 10, that, can, be, patinated, to, a, dark, blue, or, black, color, copper, forms, a, rich, variety, of, compounds, usually, with, oxidation, states, 1, and, 2, which, are, often, called, cuprous, and, cupric, respectively, copper, compounds, promote, or, catalyse, numerous, chemical, and, biological, processes, as, with, other, elements, the, simplest, compounds, of, copper, are, binary, compounds, i, e, those, containing, only, two, elements, the, principal, examples, being, oxides, sulfides, and, halides, both, cuprous, and, cupric, oxides, are, known, among, the, numerous, copper, sulfides, important, examples, include, copper, i, sulfide, cu, 2, s, and, copper, monosulfide, cus, cuprous, halides, with, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, are, known, as, are, cupric, halides, with, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, attempts, to, prepare, copper, ii, iodide, yield, only, copper, i, iodide, and, iodine, copper, forms, coordination, complexes, with,

example, in, the, kharasch, sosnovsky, reaction, a, timeline, of, copper, illustrates, how, this, metal, has, advanced, human, civilization, for, the, past, 11, 000, years, copper, occurs, naturally, as, native, metallic, copper, and, was, known, to, some, of, the, oldest, civilizations, on, record, the, history, of, copper, use, dates, to, 9000, bc, in, the, middle, east, a, copper, pendant, was, found, in, northern, iraq, that, dates, to, 8700, bc, evidence, suggests, that, gold, and, meteoric, iron, but, not, smelted, iron, were, the, only, metals, used, by, humans, before, copper, the, history, of, copper, metallurgy, is, thought, to, follow, this, sequence, first, cold, working, of, native, copper, then, annealing, smelting, and, finally, lost, wax, casting, in, southeastern, anatolia, all, four, of, these, techniques, appear, more, or, less, simultaneously, at, the, beginning, of, the, neolithic, c, 7500, bc, copper, smelting, was, independently, invented, in, different, places, the, earliest, evidence, of, lost, wax, casting, copper, comes, from, an, amulet, found, in, mehrgarh, pakistan, and, is, dated, to, 4000, bc, investment, casting, was, invented, in, 4500, 4000, bc, in, southeast, asia, smelting, was, probably, discovered, in, china, before, 2800, bc, in, central, america, around, 600, ad, and, in, west, africa, about, the, 9th, or, 10th, century, ad, carbon, dating, has, established, mining, at, alderley, edge, in, cheshire, uk, at, 2280, to, 1890, bc, tzi, the, iceman, a, male, dated, from, 3300, to, 3200, bc, was, found, with, an, axe, with, a, copper, head, 99, 7, pure, high, levels, of, arsenic, in, his, hair, suggest, an, involvement, in, copper, smelting, experience, with, copper, has, assisted, the, development, of, other, metals, in, particular, copper, smelting, likely, led, to, the, discovery, of, iron, smelting, production, in, the, old, copper, complex, in, michigan, and, wisconsin, is, dated, between, 6500, and, 3000, bc, a, copper, spearpoint, found, in, wisconsin, has, been, dated, to, 6500, bc, copper, usage, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, old, copper, complex, from, the, great, lakes, region, of, north, america, has, been, radiometrically, dated, to, as, far, back, as, 7500, bc, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, around, the, great, lakes, may, have, also, been, mining, copper, during, this, time, making, it, one, of, the, oldest, known, examples, of, copper, extraction, in, the, world, there, is, evidence, from, prehistoric, lead, pollution, from, lakes, in, michigan, that, people, in, the, region, began, mining, copper, c, 6000, bc, evidence, suggests, that, utilitarian, copper, objects, fell, increasingly, out, of, use, in, the, old, copper, complex, of, north, america, during, the, bronze, age, and, a, shift, towards, an, increased, production, of, ornamental, copper, objects, occurred, natural, bronze, a, type, of, copper, made, from, ores, rich, in, silicon, arsenic, and, rarely, tin, came, into, general, use, in, the, balkans, around, 5500, bc, alloying, copper, with, tin, to, make, bronze, was, first, practiced, about, 4000, years, after, the, discovery, of, copper, smelting, and, about, 2000, years, after, natural, bronze, had, come, into, general, use, bronze, artifacts, from, the, vin, a, culture, date, to, 4500, bc, sumerian, and, egyptian, artifacts, of, copper, and, bronze, alloys, date, to, 3000, bc, egyptian, blue, or, cuprorivaite, calcium, copper, silicate, is, a, synthetic, pigment, that, contains, copper, and, started, being, used, in, ancient, egypt, around, 3250, bc, the, manufacturing, process, of, egyptian, blue, was, known, to, the, romans, but, by, the, fourth, century, ad, the, pigment, fell, out, of, use, and, the, secret, to, its, manufacturing, process, became, lost, the, romans, said, the, blue, pigment, was, made, from, copper, silica, lime, and, natron, and, was, known, to, them, as, caeruleum, the, bronze, age, began, in, southeastern, europe, around, 3700, 3300, bc, in, northwestern, europe, about, 2500, bc, it, ended, with, the, beginning, of, the, iron, age, 2000, 1000, bc, in, the, near, east, and, 600, bc, in, northern, europe, the, transition, between, the, neolithic, period, and, the, bronze, age, was, formerly, termed, the, chalcolithic, period, copper, stone, when, copper, tools, were, used, with, stone, tools, the, term, has, gradually, fallen, out, of, favor, because, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, chalcolithic, and, neolithic, are, coterminous, at, both, ends, brass, an, alloy, of, copper, and, zinc, is, of, much, more, recent, origin, it, was, known, to, the, greeks, but, became, a, significant, supplement, to, bronze, during, the, roman, empire, in, greece, copper, was, known, by, the, name, chalkos, it, was, an, important, resource, for, the, romans, greeks, and, other, ancient, peoples, in, roman, times, it, was, known, as, aes, cyprium, aes, being, the, generic, latin, term, for, copper, alloys, and, cyprium, from, cyprus, where, much, copper, was, mined, the, phrase, was, simplified, to, cuprum, hence, the, english, copper, aphrodite, venus, in, rome, represented, copper, in, mythology, and, alchemy, because, of, its, lustrous, beauty, and, its, ancient, use, in, producing, mirrors, cyprus, the, source, of, copper, was, sacred, to, the, goddess, the, seven, heavenly, bodies, known, to, the, ancients, were, associated, with, the, seven, metals, known, in, antiquity, and, venus, was, assigned, to, copper, both, because, of, the, connection, to, the, goddess, and, because, venus, was, the, brightest, heavenly, body, after, the, sun, and, moon, and, so, corresponded, to, the, most, lustrous, and, desirable, metal, after, gold, and, silver, copper, was, first, mined, in, ancient, britain, as, early, as, 2100, bc, mining, at, the, largest, of, these, mines, the, great, orme, continued, into, the, late, bronze, age, mining, seems, to, have, been, largely, restricted, to, supergene, ores, which, were, easier, to, smelt, the, rich, copper, deposits, of, cornwall, seem, to, have, been, largely, untouched, in, spite, of, extensive, tin, mining, in, the, region, for, reasons, likely, social, and, political, rather, than, technological, in, north, america, native, copper, is, known, to, have, been, extracted, from, sites, on, isle, royale, with, primitive, stone, tools, between, 800, and, 1600, ad, copper, annealing, was, being, performed, in, the, north, american, city, of, cahokia, around, 1000, 1300, ad, there, are, several, exquisite, copper, plates, known, as, the, mississippian, copper, plates, that, have, been, found, in, north, america, in, the, area, around, cahokia, dating, from, this, time, period, 1000, 1300, ad, the, copper, plates, were, thought, to, have, been, manufactured, at, cahokia, before, ending, up, elsewhere, in, the, midwest, and, southeastern, united, states, like, the, wulfing, cache, and, etowah, plates, in, south, america, a, copper, mask, dated, to, 1000, bc, found, in, the, argentinian, andes, is, the, oldest, known, copper, artifact, discovered, in, the, andes, peru, has, been, considered, the, origin, for, early, copper, metallurgy, in, pre, columbian, america, but, the, copper, mask, from, argentina, suggests, that, the, caj, n, del, maipo, of, the, southern, andes, was, another, important, center, for, early, copper, workings, in, south, america, copper, metallurgy, was, flourishing, in, south, america, particularly, in, peru, around, 1000, ad, copper, burial, ornamentals, from, the, 15th, century, have, been, uncovered, but, the, metal, s, commercial, production, did, not, start, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, cultural, role, of, copper, has, been, important, particularly, in, currency, romans, in, the, 6th, through, 3rd, centuries, bc, used, copper, lumps, as, money, at, first, the, copper, itself, was, valued, but, gradually, the, shape, and, look, of, the, copper, became, more, important, julius, caesar, had, his, own, coins, made, from, brass, while, octavianus, augustus, caesar, s, coins, were, made, from, cu, pb, sn, alloys, with, an, estimated, annual, output, of, around, 15, 000, t, roman, copper, mining, and, smelting, activities, reached, a, scale, unsurpassed, until, the, time, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, provinces, most, intensely, mined, were, those, of, hispania, cyprus, and, in, central, europe, the, gates, of, the, temple, of, jerusalem, used, corinthian, bronze, treated, with, depletion, gilding, the, process, was, most, prevalent, in, alexandria, where, alchemy, is, thought, to, have, begun, in, ancient, india, copper, was, used, in, the, holistic, medical, science, ayurveda, for, surgical, instruments, and, other, medical, equipment, ancient, egyptians, 2400, bc, used, copper, for, sterilizing, wounds, and, drinking, water, and, later, to, treat, headaches, burns, and, itching, the, great, copper, mountain, was, a, mine, in, falun, sweden, that, operated, from, the, 10th, century, to, 1992, it, satisfied, two, thirds, of, europe, s, copper, consumption, in, the, 17th, century, and, helped, fund, many, of, sweden, s, wars, during, that, time, it, was, referred, to, as, the, nation, s, treasury, sweden, had, a, copper, backed, currency, copper, is, used, in, roofing, currency, and, for, photographic, technology, known, as, the, daguerreotype, copper, was, used, in, renaissance, sculpture, and, was, used, to, construct, the, statue, of, liberty, copper, continues, to, be, used, in, construction, of, various, types, copper, plating, and, copper, sheathing, were, widely, used, to, protect, the, under, water, hulls, of, ships, a, technique, pioneered, by, the, british, admiralty, in, the, 18th, century, the, norddeutsche, affinerie, in, hamburg, was, the, first, modern, electroplating, plant, starting, its, production, in, 1876, the, german, scientist, gottfried, osann, invented, powder, metallurgy, in, 1830, while, determining, the, metal, s, atomic, mass, around, then, it, was, discovered, that, the, amount, and, type, of, alloying, element, e, g, tin, to, copper, would, affect, bell, tones, during, the, rise, in, demand, for, copper, for, the, age, of, electricity, from, the, 1880s, until, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, the, united, states, produced, one, third, to, half, the, world, s, newly, mined, copper, major, districts, included, the, keweenaw, district, of, northern, michigan, primarily, native, copper, deposits, which, was, eclipsed, by, the, vast, sulphide, deposits, of, butte, montana, in, the, late, 1880s, which, itself, was, eclipsed, by, porphyry, deposits, of, the, southwest, united, states, especially, at, bingham, canyon, utah, and, morenci, arizona, introduction, of, open, pit, steam, shovel, mining, and, innovations, in, smelting, refining, flotation, concentration, and, other, processing, steps, led, to, mass, production, early, in, the, twentieth, century, arizona, ranked, first, followed, by, montana, then, utah, and, michigan, flash, smelting, was, developed, by, outokumpu, in, finland, and, first, applied, at, harjavalta, in, 1949, the, energy, efficient, process, accounts, for, 50, of, the, world, s, primary, copper, production, the, intergovernmental, council, of, copper, exporting, countries, formed, in, 1967, by, chile, peru, zaire, and, zambia, operated, in, the, copper, market, as, opec, does, in, oil, though, it, never, achieved, the, same, influence, particularly, because, the, second, largest, producer, the, united, states, was, never, a, member, it, was, dissolved, in, 1988, in, 2008, china, became, the, world, s, largest, importer, of, copper, and, has, continued, to, be, as, of, at, least, 2023, 187, the, major, applications, of, copper, are, electrical, wire, 60, roofing, and, plumbing, 20, and, industrial, machinery, 15, copper, is, used, mostly, as, a, pure, metal, but, when, greater, hardness, is, required, it, is, put, into, such, alloys, as, brass, and, bronze, 5, of, total, use, for, more, than, two, centuries, copper, paint, has, been, used, on, boat, hulls, to, control, the, growth, of, plants, and, shellfish, a, small, part, of, the, copper, supply, is, used, for, nutritional, supplements, and, fungicides, in, agriculture, machining, of, copper, is, possible, although, alloys, are, preferred, for, good, machinability, in, creating, intricate, parts, despite, competition, from, other, materials, copper, remains, the, preferred, electrical, conductor, in, nearly, all, categories, of, electrical, wiring, except, overhead, electric, power, transmission, where, aluminium, is, often, preferred, copper, wire, is, used, in, power, generation, power, transmission, power, distribution, telecommunications, electronics, circuitry, and, countless, types, of, electrical, equipment, electrical, wiring, is, the, most, important, market, for, the, copper, industry, this, includes, structural, power, wiring, power, distribution, cable, appliance, wire, communications, cable, automotive, wire, and, cable, and, magnet, wire, roughly, half, of, all, copper, mined, is, used, for, electrical, wire, and, cable, conductors, many, electrical, devices, rely, on, copper, wiring, because, of, its, multitude, of, inherent, beneficial, properties, such, as, its, high, electrical, conductivity, tensile, strength, ductility, creep, deformation, resistance, corrosion, resistance, low, thermal, expansion, high, thermal, conductivity, ease, of, soldering, malleability, and, ease, of, installation, for, a, short, period, from, the, late, 1960s, to, the, late, 1970s, copper, wiring, was, replaced, by, aluminium, wiring, in, many, housing, construction, projects, in, america, the, new, wiring, was, implicated, in, a, number, of, house, fires, and, the, industry, returned, to, copper, integrated, circuits, and, printed, circuit, boards, increasingly, feature, copper, in, place, of, aluminium, because, of, its, superior, electrical, conductivity, heat, sinks, and, heat, exchangers, use, copper, because, of, its, superior, heat, dissipation, properties, electromagnets, vacuum, tubes, cathode, ray, tubes, and, magnetrons, in, microwave, ovens, use, copper, as, do, waveguides, for, microwave, radiation, copper, s, superior, conductivity, enhances, the, efficiency, of, electrical, motors, this, is, important, because, motors, and, motor, driven, systems, account, for, 43, 46, of, all, global, electricity, consumption, and, 69, of, all, electricity, used, by, industry, increasing, the, mass, and, cross, section, of, copper, in, a, coil, increases, the, efficiency, of, the, motor, copper, motor, rotors, a, new, technology, designed, for, motor, applications, where, energy, savings, are, prime, design, objectives, are, enabling, general, purpose, induction, motors, to, meet, and, exceed, national, electrical, manufacturers, association, nema, premium, efficiency, standards, renewable, energy, sources, such, as, solar, wind, tidal, hydro, biomass, and, geothermal, have, become, significant, sectors, of, the, energy, market, the, rapid, growth, of, these, sources, in, the, 21st, century, has, been, prompted, by, increasing, costs, of, fossil, fuels, as, well, as, their, environmental, impact, issues, that, significantly, lowered, their, use, copper, plays, an, important, role, in, these, renewable, energy, systems, copper, usage, averages, up, to, five, times, more, in, renewable, energy, systems, than, in, traditional, power, generation, such, as, fossil, fuel, and, nuclear, power, plants, since, copper, is, an, excellent, thermal, and, electrical, conductor, among, engineering, metals, second, only, to, silver, electrical, systems, that, utilize, copper, generate, and, transmit, energy, with, high, efficiency, and, with, minimum, environmental, impacts, when, choosing, electrical, conductors, facility, planners, and, engineers, factor, capital, investment, costs, of, materials, against, operational, savings, due, to, their, electrical, energy, efficiencies, over, their, useful, lives, plus, maintenance, costs, copper, often, fares, well, in, these, calculations, a, factor, called, copper, usage, intensity, is, a, measure, of, the, quantity, of, copper, necessary, to, install, one, megawatt, of, new, power, generating, capacity, when, planning, for, a, new, renewable, power, facility, engineers, and, product, specifiers, seek, to, avoid, supply, shortages, of, selected, materials, according, to, the, united, states, geological, survey, in, ground, copper, reserves, have, increased, more, than, 700, since, 1950, from, almost, 100, million, tonnes, to, 720, million, tonnes, in, 2017, despite, the, fact, that, world, refined, usage, has, more, than, tripled, in, the, last, 50, years, copper, resources, are, estimated, to, exceed, 5, 000, million, tonnes, copper, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, as, a, durable, corrosion, resistant, and, weatherproof, architectural, material, roofs, flashings, rain, gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and, doors, have, been, made, from, copper, for, hundreds, or, thousands, of, years, copper, s, architectural, use, has, been, expanded, in, modern, times, to, include, interior, and, exterior, wall, cladding, building, expansion, joints, radio, frequency, shielding, and, antimicrobial, and, decorative, indoor, products, such, as, attractive, handrails, bathroom, fixtures, and, counter, tops, some, of, copper, s, other, important, benefits, as, an, architectural, material, include, low, thermal, movement, light, weight, lightning, protection, and, recyclability, the, metal, s, distinctive, natural, green, patina, has, long, been, coveted, by, architects, and, designers, the, final, patina, is, a, particularly, durable, layer, that, is, highly, resistant, to, atmospheric, corrosion, thereby, protecting, the, underlying, metal, against, further, weathering, it, can, be, a, mixture, of, carbonate, and, sulfate, compounds, in, various, amounts, depending, upon, environmental, conditions, such, as, sulfur, containing, acid, rain, architectural, copper, and, its, alloys, can, also, be, finished, to, take, on, a, particular, look, feel, or, color, finishes, include, mechanical, surface, treatments, chemical, coloring, and, coatings, copper, has, excellent, brazing, and, soldering, properties, and, can, be, welded, the, best, results, are, obtained, with, gas, metal, arc, welding, copper, is, biostatic, meaning, bacteria, and, many, other, forms, of, life, will, not, grow, on, it, for, this, reason, it, has, long, been, used, to, line, parts, of, ships, to, protect, against, barnacles, and, mussels, it, was, originally, used, pure, but, has, since, been, superseded, by, muntz, metal, and, copper, based, paint, similarly, as, discussed, in, copper, alloys, in, aquaculture, copper, alloys, have, become, important, netting, materials, in, the, aquaculture, industry, because, they, are, antimicrobial, and, prevent, biofouling, even, in, extreme, conditions, and, have, strong, structural, and, corrosion, resistant, properties, in, marine, environments, copper, alloy, touch, surfaces, have, natural, properties, that, destroy, a, wide, range, of, microorganisms, e, g, e, coli, o157, h7, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, staphylococcus, clostridium, difficile, influenza, a, virus, adenovirus, sars, cov, 2, and, fungi, indians, have, been, using, copper, vessels, since, ancient, times, for, storing, water, even, before, modern, science, realized, its, antimicrobial, properties, some, copper, alloys, were, proven, to, kill, more, than, 99, 9, of, disease, causing, bacteria, within, just, two, hours, when, cleaned, regularly, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, has, approved, the, registrations, of, these, copper, alloys, as, antimicrobial, materials, with, public, health, benefits, that, approval, allows, manufacturers, to, make, legal, claims, to, the, public, health, benefits, of, products, made, of, registered, alloys, in, addition, the, epa, has, approved, a, long, list, of, antimicrobial, copper, products, made, from, these, alloys, such, as, bedrails, handrails, over, bed, tables, sinks, faucets, door, knobs, toilet, hardware, computer, keyboards, health, club, equipment, and, shopping, cart, handles, copper, doorknobs, are, used, by, hospitals, to, reduce, the, transfer, of, disease, and, legionnaires, disease, is, suppressed, by, copper, tubing, in, plumbing, systems, antimicrobial, copper, alloy, products, are, now, being, installed, in, healthcare, facilities, in, the, u, k, ireland, japan, korea, france, denmark, and, brazil, as, well, as, being, called, for, in, the, us, and, in, the, subway, transit, system, in, santiago, chile, where, copper, zinc, alloy, handrails, were, installed, in, some, 30, stations, between, 2011, and, 2014, textile, fibers, can, be, blended, with, copper, to, create, antimicrobial, protective, fabrics, total, world, production, in, 2023, is, expected, to, be, almost, 23, million, metric, tons, copper, demand, is, increasing, due, to, the, ongoing, energy, transition, to, electricity, china, accounts, for, over, half, the, demand, for, some, purposes, other, metals, can, substitute, aluminium, wire, was, substituted, in, many, applications, but, improper, design, resulted, in, fire, hazards, the, safety, issues, have, since, been, solved, by, use, of, larger, sizes, of, aluminium, wire, 8awg, and, up, and, properly, designed, aluminium, wiring, is, still, being, installed, in, place, of, copper, for, example, the, airbus, a380, uses, aluminum, wire, in, place, of, copper, wire, for, electrical, power, transmission, copper, may, be, used, as, a, speculative, investment, due, to, the, predicted, increase, in, use, from, worldwide, infrastructure, growth, and, the, important, role, it, has, in, producing, wind, turbines, solar, panels, and, other, renewable, energy, sources, another, reason, predicted, demand, increases, is, the, fact, that, electric, cars, contain, an, average, of, 3, 6, times, as, much, copper, as, conventional, cars, although, the, effect, of, electric, cars, on, copper, demand, is, debated, some, people, invest, in, copper, through, copper, mining, stocks, etfs, and, futures, others, store, physical, copper, in, the, form, of, copper, bars, or, rounds, although, these, tend, to, carry, a, higher, premium, in, comparison, to, precious, metals, those, who, want, to, avoid, the, premiums, of, copper, bullion, alternatively, store, old, copper, wire, copper, tubing, or, american, pennies, made, before, 1982, copper, is, commonly, used, in, jewelry, and, according, to, some, folklore, copper, bracelets, relieve, arthritis, symptoms, in, one, trial, for, osteoarthritis, and, one, trial, for, rheumatoid, arthritis, no, differences, were, found, between, copper, bracelet, and, control, non, copper, bracelet, no, evidence, shows, that, copper, can, be, absorbed, through, the, skin, if, it, were, it, might, lead, to, copper, poisoning, chromobacterium, violaceum, and, pseudomonas, fluorescens, can, both, mobilize, solid, copper, as, a, cyanide, compound, the, ericoid, mycorrhizal, fungi, associated, with, calluna, erica, and, vaccinium, can, grow, in, metalliferous, soils, containing, copper, the, ectomycorrhizal, fungus, suillus, luteus, protects, young, pine, trees, from, copper, toxicity, a, sample, of, the, fungus, aspergillus, niger, was, found, growing, from, gold, mining, solution, and, was, found, to, contain, cyano, complexes, of, such, metals, as, gold, silver, copper, iron, and, zinc, the, fungus, also, plays, a, role, in, the, solubilization, of, heavy, metal, sulfides, copper, proteins, have, diverse, roles, in, biological, electron, transport, and, oxygen, transportation, processes, that, exploit, the, easy, interconversion, of, cu, i, and, cu, ii, copper, is, essential, in, the, aerobic, respiration, of, all, eukaryotes, in, mitochondria, it, is, found, in, cytochrome, c, oxidase, which, is, the, last, protein, in, oxidative, phosphorylation, cytochrome, c, oxidase, is, the, protein, that, binds, the, o, 2, between, a, copper, and, an, iron, the, protein, transfers, 8, electrons, to, the, o, 2, molecule, to, reduce, it, to, two, molecules, of, water, copper, is, also, found, in, many, superoxide, dismutases, proteins, that, catalyze, the, decomposition, of, superoxides, by, converting, it, by, disproportionation, to, oxygen, and, hydrogen, peroxide, the, protein, hemocyanin, is, the, oxygen, carrier, in, most, mollusks, and, some, arthropods, such, as, the, horseshoe, crab, limulus, polyphemus, because, hemocyanin, is, blue, these, organisms, have, blue, blood, rather, than, the, red, blood, of, iron, based, hemoglobin, structurally, related, to, hemocyanin, are, the, laccases, and, tyrosinases, instead, of, reversibly, binding, oxygen, these, proteins, hydroxylate, substrates, illustrated, by, their, role, in, the, formation, of, lacquers, the, biological, role, for, copper, commenced, with, the, appearance, of, oxygen, in, earth, s, atmosphere, several, copper, proteins, such, as, the, blue, copper, proteins, do, not, interact, directly, with, substrates, hence, they, are, not, enzymes, these, proteins, relay, electrons, by, the, process, called, electron, transfer, a, unique, tetranuclear, copper, center, has, been, found, in, nitrous, oxide, reductase, chemical, compounds, which, were, developed, for, treatment, of, wilson, s, disease, have, been, investigated, for, use, in, cancer, therapy, copper, is, an, essential, trace, element, in, plants, and, animals, but, not, all, microorganisms, the, human, body, contains, copper, at, a, level, of, about, 1, 4, to, 2, 1, mg, per, kg, of, body, mass, copper, is, absorbed, in, the, gut, then, transported, to, the, liver, bound, to, albumin, after, processing, in, the, liver, copper, is, distributed, to, other, tissues, in, a, second, phase, which, involves, the, protein, ceruloplasmin, carrying, the, majority, of, copper, in, blood, ceruloplasmin, also, carries, the, copper, that, is, excreted, in, milk, and, is, particularly, well, absorbed, as, a, copper, source, copper, in, the, body, normally, undergoes, enterohepatic, circulation, about, 5, mg, a, day, vs, about, 1, mg, per, day, absorbed, in, the, diet, and, excreted, from, the, body, and, the, body, is, able, to, excrete, some, excess, copper, if, needed, via, bile, which, carries, some, copper, out, of, the, liver, that, is, not, then, reabsorbed, by, the, intestine, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, iom, updated, the, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, copper, in, 2001, if, there, is, not, sufficient, information, to, establish, ears, and, rdas, an, estimate, designated, adequate, intake, ai, is, used, instead, the, ais, for, copper, are, 200, g, of, copper, for, 0, 6, month, old, males, and, females, and, 220, g, of, copper, for, 7, 12, month,

ais, and, uls, are, referred, to, as, dietary, reference, intakes, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, refers, to, the, collective, set, of, information, as, dietary, reference, values, with, population, reference, intake, pri, instead, of, rda, and, average, requirement, instead, of, ear, ai, and, ul, are, defined, the, same, as, in, the, united, states, for, women, and, men, ages, 18, and, older, the, ais, are, set, at, 1, 3, and, 1, 6, mg, day, respectively, ais, for, pregnancy, and, lactation, is, 1, 5, mg, day, for, children, ages, 1, 17, years, the, ais, increase, with, age, from, 0, 7, to, 1, 3, mg, day, these, ais, are, higher, than, the, u, s, rdas, the, european, food, safety, authority, reviewed, the, same, safety, question, and, set, its, ul, at, 5, mg, day, which, is, half, the, u, s, value, for, u, s, food, and, dietary, supplement, labeling, purposes, the, amount, in, a, serving, is, expressed, as, a, percent, of, daily, value, dv, for, copper, labeling, purposes, 100, of, the, daily, value, was, 2, 0, mg, but, as, of, may, 27, 2016, it, was, revised, to, 0, 9, mg, to, bring, it, into, agreement, with, the, rda, a, table, of, the, old, and, new, adult, daily, values, is, provided, at, reference, daily, intake, because, of, its, role, in, facilitating, iron, uptake, copper, deficiency, can, produce, anemia, like, symptoms, neutropenia, bone, abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired, growth, increased, incidence, of, infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and, abnormalities, in, glucose, and, cholesterol, metabolism, conversely, wilson, s, disease, causes, an, accumulation, of, copper, in, body, tissues, severe, deficiency, can, be, found, by, testing, for, low, plasma, or, serum, copper, levels, low, ceruloplasmin, and, low, red, blood, cell, superoxide, dismutase, levels, these, are, not, sensitive, to, marginal, copper, status, the, cytochrome, c, oxidase, activity, of, leucocytes, and, platelets, has, been, stated, as, another, factor, in, deficiency, but, the, results, have, not, been, confirmed, by, replication, gram, quantities, of, various, copper, salts, have, been, taken, in, suicide, attempts, and, produced, acute, copper, toxicity, in, humans, possibly, due, to, redox, cycling, and, the, generation, of, reactive, oxygen, species, that, damage, dna, corresponding, amounts, of, copper, salts, 30, mg, kg, are, toxic, in, animals, a, minimum, dietary, value, for, healthy, growth, in, rabbits, has, been, reported, to, be, at, least, 3, ppm, in, the, diet, however, higher, concentrations, of, copper, 100, ppm, 200, ppm, or, 500, ppm, in, the, diet, of, rabbits, may, favorably, influence, feed, conversion, efficiency, growth, rates, and, carcass, dressing, percentages, chronic, copper, toxicity, does, not, normally, occur, in, humans, because, of, transport, systems, that, regulate, absorption, and, excretion, autosomal, recessive, mutations, in, copper, transport, proteins, can, disable, these, systems, leading, to, wilson, s, disease, with, copper, accumulation, and, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, in, persons, who, have, inherited, two, defective, genes, elevated, copper, levels, have, also,
