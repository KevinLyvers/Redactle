an, electric, current, is, a, flow, of, charged, particles, such, as, electrons, or, ions, moving, through, an, electrical, conductor, or, space, it, is, defined, as, the, net, rate, of, flow, of, electric, charge, through, a, surface, 2, 622, the, moving, particles, are, called, charge, carriers, which, may, be, one, of, several, types, of, particles, depending, on, the, conductor, in, electric, circuits, the, charge, carriers, are, often, electrons, moving, through, a, wire, in, semiconductors, they, can, be, electrons, or, holes, in, an, electrolyte, the, charge, carriers, are, ions, while, in, plasma, an, ionized, gas, they, are, ions, and, electrons, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, electric, current, is, expressed, in, units, of, ampere, sometimes, called, an, amp, symbol, a, which, is, equivalent, to, one, coulomb, per, second, the, ampere, is, an, si, base, unit, and, electric, current, is, a, base, quantity, in, the, international, system, of, quantities, isq, 15, electric, current, is, also, known, as, amperage, and, is, measured, using, a, device, called, an, ammeter, 788, electric, currents, create, magnetic, forces, which, are, used, in, motors, generators, inductors, and, transformers, in, ordinary, conductors, they, cause, joule, heating, which, creates, light, in, incandescent, light, bulbs, time, varying, currents, emit, electromagnetic, waves, which, are, used, in, telecommunications, to, broadcast, information, the, conventional, symbol, for, current, is, i, which, originates, from, the, french, phrase, intensit, du, courant, current, intensity, current, intensity, is, often, referred, to, simply, as, current, the, i, symbol, was, used, by, andr, marie, amp, re, after, whom, the, unit, of, electric, current, is, named, in, formulating, amp, re, s, force, law, 1820, the, notation, travelled, from, france, to, great, britain, where, it, became, standard, although, at, least, one, journal, did, not, change, from, using, c, to, i, until, 1896, the, conventional, direction, of, current, also, known, as, conventional, current, is, arbitrarily, defined, as, the, direction, in, which, positive, charges, flow, in, a, conductive, material, the, moving, charged, particles, that, constitute, the, electric, current, are, called, charge, carriers, in, metals, which, make, up, the, wires, and, other, conductors, in, most, electrical, circuits, the, positively, charged, atomic, nuclei, of, the, atoms, are, held, in, a, fixed, position, and, the, negatively, charged, electrons, are, the, charge, carriers, free, to, move, about, in, the, metal, in, other, materials, notably, the, semiconductors, the, charge, carriers, can, be, positive, or, negative, depending, on, the, dopant, used, positive, and, negative, charge, carriers, may, even, be, present, at, the, same, time, as, happens, in, an, electrolyte, in, an, electrochemical, cell, a, flow, of, positive, charges, gives, the, same, electric, current, and, has, the, same, effect, in, a, circuit, as, an, equal, flow, of, negative, charges, in, the, opposite, direction, since, current, can, be, the, flow, of, either, positive, or, negative, charges, or, both, a, convention, is, needed, for, the, direction, of, current, that, is, independent, of, the, type, of, charge, carriers, negatively, charged, carriers, such, as, the, electrons, the, charge, carriers, in, metal, wires, and, many, other, electronic, circuit, components, therefore, flow, in, the, opposite, direction, of, conventional, current, flow, in, an, electrical, circuit, a, current, in, a, wire, or, circuit, element, can, flow, in, either, of, two, directions, when, defining, a, variable, i, displaystyle, i, to, represent, the, current, the, direction, representing, positive, current, must, be, specified, usually, by, an, arrow, on, the, circuit, schematic, diagram, 13, this, is, called, the, reference, direction, of, the, current, i, displaystyle, i, when, analyzing, electrical, circuits, the, actual, direction, of, current, through, a, specific, circuit, element, is, usually, unknown, until, the, analysis, is, completed, consequently, the, reference, directions, of, currents, are, often, assigned, arbitrarily, when, the, circuit, is, solved, a, negative, value, for, the, current, implies, the, actual, direction, of, current, through, that, circuit, element, is, opposite, that, of, the, chosen, reference, direction, 29, ohm, s, law, states, that, the, current, through, a, conductor, between, two, points, is, directly, proportional, to, the, potential, difference, across, the, two, points, introducing, the, constant, of, proportionality, the, resistance, one, arrives, at, the, usual, mathematical, equation, that, describes, this, relationship, i, v, r, displaystyle, i, frac, v, r, where, i, is, the, current, through, the, conductor, in, units, of, amperes, v, is, the, potential, difference, measured, across, the, conductor, in, units, of, volts, and, r, is, the, resistance, of, the, conductor, in, units, of, ohms, more, specifically, ohm, s, law, states, that, the, r, in, this, relation, is, constant, independent, of, the, current, in, alternating, current, ac, systems, the, movement, of, electric, charge, periodically, reverses, direction, ac, is, the, form, of, electric, power, most, commonly, delivered, to, businesses, and, residences, the, usual, waveform, of, an, ac, power, circuit, is, a, sine, wave, though, certain, applications, use, alternative, waveforms, such, as, triangular, or, square, waves, audio, and, radio, signals, carried, on, electrical, wires, are, also, examples, of, alternating, current, an, important, goal, in, these, applications, is, recovery, of, information, encoded, or, modulated, onto, the, ac, signal, in, contrast, direct, current, dc, refers, to, a, system, in, which, the, movement, of, electric, charge, in, only, one, direction, sometimes, called, unidirectional, flow, direct, current, is, produced, by, sources, such, as, batteries, thermocouples, solar, cells, and, commutator, type, electric, machines, of, the, dynamo, type, alternating, current, can, also, be, converted, to, direct, current, through, use, of, a, rectifier, direct, current, may, flow, in, a, conductor, such, as, a, wire, but, can, also, flow, through, semiconductors, insulators, or, even, through, a, vacuum, as, in, electron, or, ion, beams, an, old, name, for, direct, current, was, galvanic, current, despite, dc, being, mathematically, and, conceptually, simpler, than, ac, it, is, actually, less, widely, used, than, ac, however, due, to, the, versatility, of, electric, circuits, there, are, many, situations, that, call, for, one, type, of, electric, current, over, the, other, ac, is, almost, always, used, for, power, transmission, to, consumers, the, reason, behind, this, is, the, sum, of, multiple, historical, and, technological, details, besides, solar, power, most, power, generation, methods, produce, ac, current, in, order, to, distribute, electricity, in, the, form, of, dc, a, rectifier, must, be, used, to, convert, from, the, initial, ac, to, dc, however, rectification, is, a, complex, expensive, and, until, recent, fairly, lossy, conversion, especially, on, the, scale, of, power, plants, this, has, made, it, historically, inefficient, to, convert, the, ac, generated, by, power, plants, to, dc, for, distribution, along, the, power, lines, connecting, power, stations, to, consumers, voltage, is, stepped, up, and, down, to, reduce, heat, loss, often, multiple, times, while, dc, inherently, experiences, less, heat, loss, than, ac, it, cannot, be, stepped, up, or, down, with, transformers, this, is, due, to, transformers, working, on, the, principle, of, induction, the, changing, electric, field, created, by, ac, generates, a, changing, magnetic, field, which, induces, an, electromotive, force, emf, of, higher, or, lower, voltage, in, the, connected, power, line, dc, however, generally, does, not, fluctuate, much, resulting, in, an, unchanging, electric, field, which, generates, no, magnetic, field, making, induction, impossible, while, there, is, now, technology, for, dc, transformers, they, are, more, complex, massive, and, expensive, than, ac, transformers, and, when, infrastructural, power, grids, were, being, built, in, much, of, the, world, such, technology, either, didn, t, exist, or, was, inefficient, to, utilize, there, are, certain, cases, however, specifically, in, high, voltage, long, distance, power, transmission, hvdc, where, dc, is, used, the, main, issue, with, using, dc, in, commercial, power, transmission, is, changing, voltage, for, consumers, but, this, is, because, the, voltage, is, changed, multiple, times, for, safety, voltage, is, stepped, down, the, closer, it, gets, to, consumers, to, prevent, incredibly, high, voltage, lines, from, running, through, highly, populated, residential, areas, however, if, constant, voltage, transmission, across, long, distances, is, needed, dc, outperforms, ac, dc, carries, better, over, distance, and, experiences, less, heat, loss, as, the, skin, effect, is, only, observed, in, ac, systems, additionally, out, of, phase, ac, systems, can, only, be, connected, via, dc, for, example, the, u, s, power, grid, is, split, into, three, asynchronous, ac, systems, for, power, to, be, transferred, between, any, of, these, systems, dc, must, be, used, to, mediate, the, transfer, household, electronic, devices, overwhelmingly, use, dc, this, is, due, to, the, nature, of, basic, circuit, components, many, essential, components, in, electronic, devices, such, as, transistors, diodes, and, logic, gates, operate, on, a, one, way, basis, the, diode, for, example, only, allows, current, to, flow, in, one, fixed, direction, trying, to, use, ac, with, such, components, would, immensely, complicate, circuit, design, requiring, designs, to, function, symmetrically, with, respect, to, current, direction, additionally, cpus, update, millions, of, times, per, second, much, faster, than, the, mere, 100, 120, times, per, second, that, ac, alternates, polarities, this, would, cause, massive, inconsistencies, in, cpu, voltage, and, performance, meaning, all, devices, that, use, cpus, must, also, use, dc, there, are, however, devices, that, are, indifferent, to, current, type, due, to, incredibly, simple, functionality, these, devices, such, as, incandescent, lightbulbs, or, some, toaster, ovens, operate, by, running, current, through, high, resistance, elements, emitting, em, radiation, both, ac, and, dc, is, affected, by, resistance, so, the, current, type, used, is, irrelevant, although, both, types, may, need, to, use, different, voltages, to, produce, identical, results, in, university, level, em, classes, whether, it, be, algebra, or, calculus, based, dc, is, typically, used, as, an, introduction, to, electric, current, this, is, due, to, dc, being, mathematically, and, conceptually, simpler, than, ac, a, constant, direct, current, is, arguably, much, more, intuitive, than, one, that, alternates, many, times, a, second, dc, power, sources, are, also, trivial, to, add, to, circuits, both, in, theory, and, in, practice, for, ac, however, phase, must, be, considered, when, dealing, with, multiple, power, sources, whether, the, phase, is, off, by, 0, or, makes, a, massive, difference, in, the, functionality, of, a, circuit, additionally, circuits, with, capacitive, and, inductive, elements, are, very, easy, to, mathematically, represent, with, dc, charge, on, a, capacitor, and, resistance, on, an, inductor, asymptotically, stabilize, with, time, meaning, dc, systems, reach, steady, state, eventually, usually, fairly, quickly, in, mathematical, practice, problems, such, systems, are, easy, to, analyze, once, they, reach, steady, state, and, even, systems, that, have, not, stabilized, are, not, too, difficult, to, analyze, as, all, the, required, formulas, are, relatively, simple, functions, of, time, and, initial, final, voltage, ac, on, the, other, hand, never, reaches, steady, state, the, fluctuating, current, means, there, will, always, be, changing, capacitive, and, inductive, effects, in, the, circuit, complicating, mathematical, analysis, of, the, circuit, while, the, required, formulas, for, these, effects, are, still, relatively, simple, functions, of, time, and, voltage, voltage, is, now, a, sinusoidal, function, of, time, not, to, mention, the, phase, delay, and, forwarding, in, capacitive, and, inductive, elements, the, occurrences, of, electric, current, can, be, divided, into, three, main, types, inorganic, biological, and, technological, electrostatic, materials, piezoelectricity, the, geophysical, flow, of, molten, iron, natural, observable, examples, of, electric, current, include, static, electric, discharge, and, electricity, in, the, earth, s, mantle, electrostaticity, was, among, the, earliest, discoveries, of, inorganic, electricity, occurring, in, nature, already, early, in, history, it, was, discovered, that, certain, types, of, stone, and, resins, like, amber, can, become, electrostatic, when, friction, is, applied, rubbing, amber, will, cause, it, to, become, negatively, charged, piezoelectricity, occurs, when, applying, mechanical, strain, to, certain, crystals, causing, them, to, become, electrically, polarized, iron, monoxide, feo, which, makes, up, 9, of, the, earth, mantle, conducts, electricity, especially, when, molten, this, is, believed, to, contribute, to, earth, s, rotation, atmospheric, occurrence, lightning, flashes, are, also, one, of, the, earliest, discovered, natural, observable, examples, of, electric, current, electric, charge, can, build, up, vertically, in, dense, clouds, leading, to, lightning, that, discharges, in, flashes, to, the, ground, the, flashes, follow, a, path, of, lowest, electric, resistance, through, the, air, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, discovered, that, the, solar, wind, is, the, source, of, the, polar, auroras, that, occur, in, the, atmosphere, near, the, north, and, south, poles, the, aurora, borealis, and, aurora, australis, are, generated, by, flows, of, charged, particles, emanating, from, the, sun, which, occur, when, solar, activity, is, high, temporarily, strong, solar, flares, cosmic, occurrences, the, discovery, of, birkeland, currents, by, kristian, birkeland, has, triggered, further, research, into, electric, phenomena, in, the, magnetosphere, and, in, the, cosmos, thanks, to, the, research, of, pioneering, scientists, and, engineers, like, hannes, alfv, n, irving, langmuir, and, donald, e, scott, it, was, discovered, that, electricity, is, ubiquitous, in, the, universe, plasmas, account, for, a, large, part, of, matter, in, the, cosmos, plasmas, are, electrically, charged, it, is, now, believed, that, plasma, filled, cosmic, filaments, are, probably, responsible, for, transfer, of, electricity, through, the, universe, recent, astrophysical, research, indicates, that, such, filaments, can, transfer, electricity, both, between, galaxies, and, between, star, clusters, neutron, stars, pulsars, magnetars, quasars, and, astrophysical, jets, play, an, important, role, in, cosmic, electric, phenomena, it, is, hypothesized, that, star, formation, in, clusters, is, in, part, powered, by, those, filaments, as, the, star, formation, mostly, occurs, along, strings, following, the, plasma, filaments, it, is, believed, that, the, intergalactic, plasma, filaments, are, slowly, rotating, because, of, their, electric, charge, that, generates, multi, layer, concentric, electromagnetic, fields, this, filament, rotation, may, account, for, the, position, and, rotation, of, galaxies, this, is, a, field, of, ongoing, scientific, research, the, james, webb, space, telescope, yields, new, insights, that, enable, further, astrophysical, exploration, into, this, subject, nerve, system, and, electromagnetic, sensitivity, a, biological, example, of, current, is, the, flow, of, ions, in, neurons, and, nerves, responsible, for, both, brain, activity, and, sensory, perception, neurons, are, found, in, all, animals, even, in, very, small, animals, like, starfish, and, seahorses, brain, development, is, more, substantial, in, higher, organisms, enabling, thought, and, memory, consciousness, is, enabled, in, the, highest, organisms, including, man, some, mammals, like, whales, and, dolphins, are, capable, of, wireless, communication, thanks, to, their, brain, activity, or, quantum, effects, a, pod, of, these, sea, mammals, can, communicate, for, example, to, warn, each, other, of, predators, migratory, birds, can, sense, the, magnetic, field, of, the, earth, using, it, to, coordinate, their, flight, some, migratory, sea, animals, like, salmon, and, sea, turtles, also, use, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, navigate, during, long, distance, migration, electroreception, and, electrogenesis, electroreceptive, animals, have, the, ability, to, perceive, natural, electrical, stimuli, electrogenic, animals, like, eels, have, organs, that, are, capable, of, producing, electric, shocks, as, a, means, of, protection, or, as, part, of, predator, behaviour, photosynthesis, and, electrification, of, mechanical, energy, some, species, of, plants, can, generate, electricity, at, a, microscopic, level, either, through, photosynthesis, or, through, electrification, of, mechanical, energy, for, instance, the, oleander, is, able, to, capture, mechanical, energy, from, wind, stirring, its, leaves, and, transform, it, into, electricity, for, use, in, the, plant, natural, photosynthesis, in, chlorophyll, is, highly, efficient, at, converting, sunlight, into, electricity, which, then, drives, the, chemical, formation, of, glucose, that, electricity, can, also, be, used, artificially, in, a, photo, bioelectrochemical, cell, man, made, occurrences, of, electric, current, include, the, controlled, flow, of, conduction, electrons, in, metal, wires, such, as, overhead, power, lines, for, long, distance, energy, delivery, and, the, smaller, wires, within, electrical, and, electronic, devices, eddy, currents, are, electric, currents, that, occur, in, conductors, exposed, to, changing, magnetic, fields, similarly, electric, currents, occur, particularly, in, the, surface, of, conductors, exposed, to, electromagnetic, waves, when, oscillating, electric, currents, flow, at, the, correct, voltages, within, radio, antennas, radio, waves, are, generated, pantographs, are, an, example, of, electricity, transfer, through, a, sliding, contact, the, pantograph, has, enabled, large, scale, electrification, of, railways, subway, and, tram, networks, as, well, as, networks, of, trolleybuses, subsea, interconnectors, enable, large, scale, coast, to, coast, electricity, transfer, between, countries, in, electronics, other, forms, of, electric, current, include, the, flow, of, electrons, through, resistors, or, through, the, vacuum, in, a, vacuum, tube, the, flow, of, ions, inside, a, battery, and, the, flow, of, holes, within, metals, and, semiconductors, a, newly, developed, use, of, electric, current, is, wireless, charging, of, batteries, for, use, in, phones, and, electric, vehicles, for, instance, poynting, s, theorem, shows, that, electric, energy, can, be, transferred, from, a, to, b, without, carrying, current, from, a, to, b, this, is, achieved, by, using, one, or, more, coils, in, a, the, coils, generate, an, electromagnetic, field, that, carries, the, electric, energy, to, b, wireless, charging, devices, could, potentially, be, integrated, in, furniture, walls, or, road, surfaces, currently, research, is, being, done, in, long, distance, wireless, charging, current, can, be, measured, using, an, ammeter, while, a, galvanometer, offers, direct, electric, current, measurement, it, requires, breaking, the, electrical, circuit, which, can, be, inconvenient, for, certain, applications, current, can, also, be, measured, without, breaking, the, circuit, by, detecting, the, magnetic, field, associated, with, the, current, devices, at, the, circuit, level, use, various, techniques, to, measure, current, joule, heating, also, known, as, ohmic, heating, and, resistive, heating, is, the, process, of, power, dissipation, 36, by, which, the, passage, of, an, electric, current, through, a, conductor, increases, the, internal, energy, of, the, conductor, 846, converting, thermodynamic, work, into, heat, 846, fn, 5, the, phenomenon, was, first, studied, by, james, prescott, joule, in, 1841, joule, immersed, a, length, of, wire, in, a, fixed, mass, of, water, and, measured, the, temperature, rise, due, to, a, known, current, through, the, wire, for, a, 30, minute, period, by, varying, the, current, and, the, length, of, the, wire, he, deduced, that, the, heat, produced, was, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, current, multiplied, by, the, electrical, resistance, of, the, wire, p, i, 2, r, displaystyle, p, propto, i, 2, r, this, relationship, is, known, as, joule, s, law, 36, the, si, unit, of, energy, was, subsequently, named, the, joule, and, given, the, symbol, j, 20, the, commonly, known, si, unit, of, power, the, watt, symbol, w, is, equivalent, to, one, joule, per, second, 20, in, an, electromagnet, a, coil, of, wires, behaves, like, a, magnet, when, an, electric, current, flows, through, it, when, the, current, is, switched, off, the, coil, loses, its, magnetism, immediately, electric, current, produces, a, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, field, can, be, visualized, as, a, pattern, of, circular, field, lines, surrounding, the, wire, that, persists, as, long, as, there, is, current, magnetic, fields, can, also, be, used, to, make, electric, currents, when, a, changing, magnetic, field, is, applied, to, a, conductor, an, electromotive, force, emf, is, induced, 1004, which, starts, an, electric, current, when, there, is, a, suitable, path, when, an, electric, current, flows, in, a, suitably, shaped, conductor, at, radio, frequencies, radio, waves, can, be, generated, these, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, and, can, cause, electric, currents, in, distant, conductors, in, metallic, solids, electric, charge, flows, by, means, of, electrons, from, lower, to, higher, electrical, potential, in, other, media, any, stream, of, charged, objects, ions, for, example, may, constitute, an, electric, current, to, provide, a, definition, of, current, independent, of, the, type, of, charge, carriers, conventional, current, is, defined, as, moving, in, the, same, direction, as, the, positive, charge, flow, so, in, metals, where, the, charge, carriers, electrons, are, negative, conventional, current, is, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, overall, electron, movement, in, conductors, where, the, charge, carriers, are, positive, conventional, current, is, in, the, same, direction, as, the, charge, carriers, in, a, vacuum, a, beam, of, ions, or, electrons, may, be, formed, in, other, conductive, materials, the, electric, current, is, due, to, the, flow, of, both, positively, and, negatively, charged, particles, at, the, same, time, in, still, others, the, current, is, entirely, due, to, positive, charge, flow, for, example, the, electric, currents, in, electrolytes, are, flows, of, positively, and, negatively, charged, ions, in, a, common, lead, acid, electrochemical, cell, electric, currents, are, composed, of, positive, hydronium, ions, flowing, in, one, direction, and, negative, sulfate, ions, flowing, in, the, other, electric, currents, in, sparks, or, plasma, are, flows, of, electrons, as, well, as, positive, and, negative, ions, in, ice, and, in, certain, solid, electrolytes, the, electric, current, is, entirely, composed, of, flowing, ions, in, a, metal, some, of, the, outer, electrons, in, each, atom, are, not, bound, to, the, individual, molecules, as, they, are, in, molecular, solids, or, in, full, bands, as, they, are, in, insulating, materials, but, are, free, to, move, within, the, metal, lattice, these, conduction, electrons, can, serve, as, charge, carriers, carrying, a, current, metals, are, particularly, conductive, because, there, are, many, of, these, free, electrons, with, no, external, electric, field, applied, these, electrons, move, about, randomly, due, to, thermal, energy, but, on, average, there, is, zero, net, current, within, the, metal, at, room, temperature, the, average, speed, of, these, random, motions, is, 10, 6, metres, per, second, given, a, surface, through, which, a, metal, wire, passes, electrons, move, in, both, directions, across, the, surface, at, an, equal, rate, as, george, gamow, wrote, in, his, popular, science, book, one, two, three, infinity, 1947, the, metallic, substances, differ, from, all, other, materials, by, the, fact, that, the, outer, shells, of, their, atoms, are, bound, rather, loosely, and, often, let, one, of, their, electrons, go, free, thus, the, interior, of, a, metal, is, filled, up, with, a, large, number, of, unattached, electrons, that, travel, aimlessly, around, like, a, crowd, of, displaced, persons, when, a, metal, wire, is, subjected, to, electric, force, applied, on, its, opposite, ends, these, free, electrons, rush, in, the, direction, of, the, force, thus, forming, what, we, call, an, electric, current, when, a, metal, wire, is, connected, across, the, two, terminals, of, a, dc, voltage, source, such, as, a, battery, the, source, places, an, electric, field, across, the, conductor, the, moment, contact, is, made, the, free, electrons, of, the, conductor, are, forced, to, drift, toward, the, positive, terminal, under, the, influence, of, this, field, the, free, electrons, are, therefore, the, charge, carrier, in, a, typical, solid, conductor, for, a, steady, flow, of, charge, through, a, surface, the, current, i, in, amperes, can, be, calculated, with, the, following, equation, i, q, t, displaystyle, i, q, over, t, where, q, is, the, electric, charge, transferred, through, the, surface, over, a, time, t, if, q, and, t, are, measured, in, coulombs, and, seconds, respectively, i, is, in, amperes, more, generally, electric, current, can, be, represented, as, the, rate, at, which, charge, flows, through, a, given, surface, as, i, d, q, d, t, displaystyle, i, frac, mathrm, d, q, mathrm, d, t, electric, currents, in, electrolytes, are, flows, of, electrically, charged, particles, ions, for, example, if, an, electric, field, is, placed, across, a, solution, of, na, and, cl, and, conditions, are, right, the, sodium, ions, move, towards, the, negative, electrode, cathode, while, the, chloride, ions, move, towards, the, positive, electrode, anode, reactions, take, place, at, both, electrode, surfaces, neutralizing, each, ion, water, ice, and, certain, solid, electrolytes, called, proton, conductors, contain, positive, hydrogen, ions, protons, that, are, mobile, in, these, materials, electric, currents, are, composed, of, moving, protons, as, opposed, to, the, moving, electrons, in, metals, in, certain, electrolyte, mixtures, brightly, coloured, ions, are, the, moving, electric, charges, the, slow, progress, of, the, colour, makes, the, current, visible, in, air, and, other, ordinary, gases, below, the, breakdown, field, the, dominant, source, of, electrical, conduction, is, via, relatively, few, mobile, ions, produced, by, radioactive, gases, ultraviolet, light, or, cosmic, rays, since, the, electrical, conductivity, is, low, gases, are, dielectrics, or, insulators, however, once, the, applied, electric, field, approaches, the, breakdown, value, free, electrons, become, sufficiently, accelerated, by, the, electric, field, to, create, additional, free, electrons, by, colliding, and, ionizing, neutral, gas, atoms, or, molecules, in, a, process, called, avalanche, breakdown, the, breakdown, process, forms, a, plasma, that, contains, enough, mobile, electrons, and, positive, ions, to, make, it, an, electrical, conductor, in, the, process, it, forms, a, light, emitting, conductive, path, such, as, a, spark, arc, or, lightning, plasma, is, the, state, of, matter, where, some, of, the, electrons, in, a, gas, are, stripped, or, ionized, from, their, molecules, or, atoms, a, plasma, can, be, formed, by, high, temperature, or, by, application, of, a, high, electric, or, alternating, magnetic, field, as, noted, above, due, to, their, lower, mass, the, electrons, in, a, plasma, accelerate, more, quickly, in, response, to, an, electric, field, than, the, heavier, positive, ions, and, hence, carry, the, bulk, of, the, current, the, free, ions, recombine, to, create, new, chemical, compounds, for, example, breaking, atmospheric, oxygen, into, single, oxygen, which, then, recombine, creating, ozone, since, a, perfect, vacuum, contains, no, charged, particles, it, normally, behaves, as, a, perfect, insulator, however, metal, electrode, surfaces, can, cause, a, region, of, the, vacuum, to, become, conductive, by, injecting, free, electrons, or, ions, through, either, field, electron, emission, or, thermionic, emission, thermionic, emission, occurs, when, the, thermal, energy, exceeds, the, metal, s, work, function, while, field, electron, emission, occurs, when, the, electric, field, at, the, surface, of, the, metal, is, high, enough, to, cause, tunneling, which, results, in, the, ejection, of, free, electrons, from, the, metal, into, the, vacuum, externally, heated, electrodes, are, often, used, to, generate, an, electron, cloud, as, in, the, filament, or, indirectly, heated, cathode, of, vacuum, tubes, cold, electrodes, can, also, spontaneously, produce, electron, clouds, via, thermionic, emission, when, small, incandescent, regions, called, cathode, spots, or, anode, spots, are, formed, these, are, incandescent, regions, of, the, electrode, surface, that, are, created, by, a, localized, high, current, these, regions, may, be, initiated, by, field, electron, emission, but, are, then, sustained, by, localized, thermionic, emission, once, a, vacuum, arc, forms, these, small, electron, emitting, regions, can, form, quite, rapidly, even, explosively, on, a, metal, surface, subjected, to, a, high, electrical, field, vacuum, tubes, and, sprytrons, are, some, of, the, electronic, switching, and, amplifying, devices, based, on, vacuum, conductivity, superconductivity, is, a, phenomenon, of, exactly, zero, electrical, resistance, and, expulsion, of, magnetic, fields, occurring, in, certain, materials, when, cooled, below, a, characteristic, critical, temperature, it, was, discovered, by, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, on, april, 8, 1911, in, leiden, like, ferromagnetism, and, atomic, spectral, lines, superconductivity, is, a, quantum, mechanical, phenomenon, it, is, characterized, by, the, meissner, effect, the, complete, ejection, of, magnetic, field, lines, from, the, interior, of, the, superconductor, as, it, transitions, into, the, superconducting, state, the, occurrence, of, the, meissner, effect, indicates, that, superconductivity, cannot, be, understood, simply, as, the, idealization, of, perfect, conductivity, in, classical, physics, in, a, semiconductor, it, is, sometimes, useful, to, think, of, the, current, as, due, to, the, flow, of, positive, holes, the, mobile, positive, charge, carriers, that, are, places, where, the, semiconductor, crystal, is, missing, a, valence, electron, this, is, the, case, in, a, p, type, semiconductor, a, semiconductor, has, electrical, conductivity, intermediate, in, magnitude, between, that, of, a, conductor, and, an, insulator, this, means, a, conductivity, roughly, in, the, range, of, 10, 2, to, 10, 4, siemens, per, centimeter, s, cm, 1, in, the, classic, crystalline, semiconductors, electrons, can, have, energies, only, within, certain, bands, i, e, ranges, of, levels, of, energy, energetically, these, bands, are, located, between, the, energy, of, the, ground, state, the, state, in, which, electrons, are, tightly, bound, to, the, atomic, nuclei, of, the, material, and, the, free, electron, energy, the, latter, describing, the, energy, required, for, an, electron, to, escape, entirely, from, the, material, the, energy, bands, each, correspond, to, many, discrete, quantum, states, of, the, electrons, and, most, of, the, states, with, low, energy, closer, to, the, nucleus, are, occupied, up, to, a, particular, band, called, the, valence, band, semiconductors, and, insulators, are, distinguished, from, metals, because, the, valence, band, in, any, given, metal, is, nearly, filled, with, electrons, under, usual, operating, conditions, while, very, few, semiconductor, or, virtually, none, insulator, of, them, are, available, in, the, conduction, band, the, band, immediately, above, the, valence, band, the, ease, of, exciting, electrons, in, the, semiconductor, from, the, valence, band, to, the, conduction, band, depends, on, the, band, gap, between, the, bands, the, size, of, this, energy, band, gap, serves, as, an, arbitrary, dividing, line, roughly, 4, ev, between, semiconductors, and, insulators, with, covalent, bonds, an, electron, moves, by, hopping, to, a, neighboring, bond, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, requires, that, the, electron, be, lifted, into, the, higher, anti, bonding, state, of, that, bond, for, delocalized, states, for, example, in, one, dimension, that, is, in, a, nanowire, for, every, energy, there, is, a, state, with, electrons, flowing, in, one, direction, and, another, state, with, the, electrons, flowing, in, the, other, for, a, net, current, to, flow, more, states, for, one, direction, than, for, the, other, direction, must, be, occupied, for, this, to, occur, energy, is, required, as, in, the, semiconductor, the, next, higher, states, lie, above, the, band, gap, often, this, is, stated, as, full, bands, do, not, contribute, to, the, electrical, conductivity, however, as, a, semiconductor, s, temperature, rises, above, absolute, zero, there, is, more, energy, in, the, semiconductor, to, spend, on, lattice, vibration, and, on, exciting, electrons, into, the, conduction, band, the, current, carrying, electrons, in, the, conduction, band, are, known, as, free, electrons, though, they, are, often, simply, called, electrons, if, that, is, clear, in, context, current, density, is, the, rate, at, which, charge, passes, through, a, chosen, unit, area, 31, it, is, defined, as, a, vector, whose, magnitude, is, the, current, per, unit, cross, sectional, area, 749, as, discussed, in, reference, direction, the, direction, is, arbitrary, conventionally, if, the, moving, charges, are, positive, then, the, current, density, has, the, same, sign, as, the, velocity, of, the, charges, for, negative, charges, the, sign, of, the, current, density, is, opposite, to, the, velocity, of, the, charges, 749, in, si, units, current, density, symbol, j, is, expressed, in, the, si, base, units, of, amperes, per, square, metre, 22, in, linear, materials, such, as, metals, and, under, low, frequencies, the, current, density, across, the, conductor, surface, is, uniform, in, such, conditions, ohm, s, law, states, that, the, current, is, directly, proportional, to, the, potential, difference, between, two, ends, across, of, that, metal, ideal, resistor, or, other, ohmic, device, i, v, r, displaystyle, i, v, over, r, where, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, current, measured, in, amperes, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, potential, difference, measured, in, volts, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, resistance, measured, in, ohms, for, alternating, currents, especially, at, higher, frequencies, skin, effect, causes, the, current, to, spread, unevenly, across, the, conductor, cross, section, with, higher, density, near, the, surface, thus, increasing, the, apparent, resistance, the, mobile, charged, particles, within, a, conductor, move, constantly, in, random, directions, like, the, particles, of, a, gas, more, accurately, a, fermi, gas, to, create, a, net, flow, of, charge, the, particles, must, also, move, together, with, an, average, drift, rate, electrons, are, the, charge, carriers, in, most, metals, and, they, follow, an, erratic, path, bouncing, from, atom, to, atom, but, generally, drifting, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, electric, field, the, speed, they, drift, at, can, be, calculated, from, the, equation, v, i, n, a, q, displaystyle, v, frac, i, naq, where, typically, electric, charges, in, solids, flow, slowly, for, example, in, a, copper, wire, of, cross, section, 0, 5, mm, 2, carrying, a, current, of, 5, a, the, drift, velocity, of, the, electrons, is, on, the, order, of, a, millimetre, per, second, to, take, a, different, example, in, the, near, vacuum, inside, a, cathode, ray, tube, the, electrons, travel, in, near, straight, lines, at, about, a, tenth, of, the, speed, of, light, any, accelerating, electric, charge, and, therefore, any, changing, electric, current, gives, rise, to, an, electromagnetic, wave, that, propagates, at, very, high, speed, outside, the, surface, of, the, conductor, this, speed, is, usually, a, significant, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, as, can, be, deduced, from, maxwell, s, equations, and, is, therefore, many, times, faster, than, the, drift, velocity, of, the, electrons, for, example, in, ac, power, lines, the, waves, of, electromagnetic, energy, propagate, through, the, space, between, the, wires, moving, from, a, source, to, a, distant, load, even, though, the, electrons, in, the, wires, only, move, back, and, forth, over, a, tiny, distance, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, the, electromagnetic, wave, to, the, speed, of, light, in, free, space, is, called, the, velocity, factor, and, depends, on, the, electromagnetic, properties, of, the, conductor, and, the, insulating, materials, surrounding, it, and, on, their, shape, and, size, the, magnitudes, not, the, natures, of, these, three, velocities, can, be, illustrated, by, an, analogy, with, the, three, similar, velocities, associated, with, gases, see, also, hydraulic, analogy
