the, pedosphere, from, ancient, greek, p, don, ground, earth, and, spha, ra, sphere, is, the, outermost, layer, of, the, earth, that, is, composed, of, soil, and, subject, to, soil, formation, processes, it, exists, at, the, interface, of, the, lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and, biosphere, the, pedosphere, is, the, skin, of, the, earth, and, only, develops, when, there, is, a, dynamic, interaction, between, the, atmosphere, air, in, and, above, the, soil, biosphere, living, organisms, lithosphere, unconsolidated, regolith, and, consolidated, bedrock, and, the, hydrosphere, water, in, on, and, below, the, soil, the, pedosphere, is, the, foundation, of, terrestrial, life, on, earth, the, pedosphere, acts, as, the, mediator, of, chemical, and, biogeochemical, flux, into, and, out, of, these, respective, systems, and, is, made, up, of, gaseous, mineralic, fluid, and, biologic, components, the, pedosphere, lies, within, the, critical, zone, a, broader, interface, that, includes, vegetation, pedosphere, aquifer, systems, regolith, and, finally, ends, at, some, depth, in, the, bedrock, where, the, biosphere, and, hydrosphere, cease, to, make, significant, changes, to, the, chemistry, at, depth, as, part, of, the, larger, global, system, any, particular, environment, in, which, soil, forms, is, influenced, solely, by, its, geographic, position, on, the, globe, as, climatic, geologic, biologic, and, anthropogenic, changes, occur, with, changes, in, longitude, and, latitude, the, pedosphere, lies, below, the, vegetative, cover, of, the, biosphere, and, above, the, hydrosphere, and, lithosphere, the, soil, forming, process, pedogenesis, can, begin, without, the, aid, of, biology, but, is, significantly, quickened, in, the, presence, of, biologic, reactions, where, it, forms, a, soil, carbon, sponge, soil, formation, begins, with, the, chemical, and, or, physical, breakdown, of, minerals, to, form, the, initial, material, that, overlies, the, bedrock, substrate, biology, quickens, this, by, secreting, acidic, compounds, that, help, break, rock, apart, particular, biologic, pioneers, are, lichen, mosses, and, seed, bearing, plants, but, many, other, inorganic, reactions, take, place, that, diversify, the, chemical, makeup, of, the, early, soil, layer, once, weathering, and, decomposition, products, accumulate, a, coherent, soil, body, allows, the, migration, of, fluids, both, vertically, and, laterally, through, the, soil, profile, causing, ion, exchange, between, solid, fluid, and, gaseous, phases, as, time, progresses, the, bulk, geochemistry, of, the, soil, layer, will, deviate, away, from, the, initial, composition, of, the, bedrock, and, will, evolve, to, a, chemistry, that, reflects, the, type, of, reactions, that, take, place, in, the, soil, the, primary, conditions, for, soil, development, are, controlled, by, the, chemical, composition, of, the, rock, on, which, the, soil, will, be, rock, types, that, form, the, base, of, the, soil, profile, are, often, either, sedimentary, carbonate, or, siliceous, igneous, or, metaigneous, metamorphosed, igneous, rocks, or, volcanic, and, metavolcanic, rocks, the, rock, type, and, the, processes, that, lead, to, its, exposure, at, the, surface, are, controlled, by, the, regional, geologic, setting, of, the, specific, area, under, study, which, revolve, around, the, underlying, theory, of, plate, tectonics, subsequent, deformation, uplift, subsidence, and, deposition, metaigneous, and, metavolcanic, rocks, form, the, largest, component, of, cratons, and, are, high, in, silica, igneous, and, volcanic, rocks, are, also, high, in, silica, but, with, non, metamorphosed, rock, weathering, becomes, faster, and, the, mobilization, of, ions, is, more, widespread, rocks, high, in, silica, produce, silicic, acid, as, a, weathering, product, there, are, few, rock, types, that, lead, to, localized, enrichment, of, some, of, the, biologically, limiting, elements, like, phosphorus, p, and, nitrogen, n, phosphatic, shale, 15, p, 2, o, 5, and, phosphorite, 15, p, 2, o, 5, form, in, anoxic, deep, water, basins, that, preserve, organic, material, greenstone, metabasalt, phyllite, and, schist, release, up, to, 30, 50, of, the, nitrogen, pool, thick, successions, of, carbonate, rocks, are, often, deposited, on, craton, margins, during, sea, level, rise, the, widespread, dissolution, of, carbonate, and, evaporites, leads, to, elevated, levels, of, mg, 2, hco, 3, sr, 2, na, cl, and, so, 2, 4, ions, in, aqueous, solution, the, process, of, soil, formation, is, dominated, by, chemical, weathering, of, silicate, minerals, aided, by, acidic, products, of, pioneering, plants, and, organisms, as, well, as, carbonic, acid, inputs, from, the, atmosphere, carbonic, acid, is, produced, in, the, atmosphere, and, soil, layers, through, the, carbonation, reaction, this, is, the, dominant, form, of, chemical, weathering, and, aides, in, the, breakdown, of, carbonate, minerals, such, as, calcite, and, dolomite, and, silicate, minerals, such, as, feldspar, the, breakdown, of, the, na, feldspar, albite, by, carbonic, acid, to, form, kaolinite, clay, is, as, follows, evidence, of, this, reaction, in, the, field, would, be, elevated, levels, of, bicarbonate, hco, 3, sodium, and, silica, ions, in, the, water, runoff, the, breakdown, of, carbonate, minerals, the, further, dissolution, of, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, and, bicarbonate, hco, 3, produces, co, 2, gas, oxidization, is, also, a, major, contributor, to, the, breakdown, of, many, silicate, minerals, and, formation, of, secondary, minerals, diagenesis, in, the, early, soil, profile, oxidation, of, olivine, femgsio, 4, releases, fe, mg, and, si, ions, the, mg, is, soluble, in, water, and, is, carried, in, the, runoff, but, the, fe, often, reacts, with, oxygen, to, precipitate, fe, 2, o, 3, hematite, the, oxidized, state, of, iron, oxide, sulfur, a, byproduct, of, decaying, organic, material, will, also, react, with, iron, to, form, pyrite, fes, 2, in, reducing, environments, pyrite, dissolution, leads, to, low, ph, levels, due, to, elevated, h, ions, and, further, precipitation, of, fe, 2, o, 3, ultimately, changing, the, redox, conditions, of, the, environment, inputs, from, the, biosphere, may, begin, with, lichen, and, other, microorganisms, that, secrete, oxalic, acid, these, microorganisms, associated, with, the, lichen, community, or, independently, inhabiting, rocks, include, blue, green, algae, green, algae, various, fungi, and, numerous, bacteria, lichen, has, long, been, viewed, as, the, pioneers, of, soil, development, as, the, following, 1997, isozaki, statement, suggests, the, initial, conversion, of, rock, into, soil, is, carried, on, by, the, pioneer, lichens, and, their, successors, the, mosses, in, which, the, hair, like, rhizoids, assume, the, role, of, roots, in, breaking, down, the, surface, into, fine, dust, however, lichens, are, not, necessarily, the, only, pioneering, organisms, nor, the, earliest, form, of, soil, formation, as, it, has, been, documented, that, seed, bearing, plants, may, occupy, an, area, and, colonize, quicker, than, lichen, also, eolian, sedimentation, wind, generated, can, produce, high, rates, of, sediment, accumulation, nonetheless, lichen, can, certainly, withstand, harsher, conditions, than, most, vascular, plants, and, although, they, have, slower, colonization, rates, they, do, form, the, dominant, group, in, alpine, regions, organic, acids, released, from, plant, roots, include, acetic, acid, and, citric, acid, during, the, decay, of, organic, matter, phenolic, acids, are, released, from, plant, matter, and, humic, acid, and, fulvic, acid, are, released, by, soil, microbes, these, organic, acids, speed, up, chemical, weathering, by, combining, with, some, of, the, weathering, products, in, a, process, known, as, chelation, in, the, soil, profile, these, organic, acids, are, often, concentrated, at, the, top, of, the, profile, while, carbonic, acid, plays, a, larger, role, towards, the, bottom, of, the, profile, or, below, in, the, aquifer, as, the, soil, column, develops, further, into, thicker, accumulations, larger, animals, come, to, inhabit, the, soil, and, continue, to, alter, the, chemical, evolution, of, their, respective, niche, earthworms, aerate, the, soil, and, convert, large, amounts, of, organic, matter, into, rich, humus, improving, soil, fertility, small, burrowing, mammals, store, food, grow, young, and, may, hibernate, in, the, pedosphere, altering, the, course, of, soil, evolution, large, mammalian, herbivores, above, ground, transport, nutrients, in, form, of, nitrogen, rich, waste, and, phosphorus, rich, antlers, while, predators, leave, phosphorus, rich, piles, of, bones, on, the, soil, surface, leading, to, localized, enrichment, of, the, soil, nutrient, cycling, in, lakes, and, freshwater, wetlands, depends, heavily, on, redox, conditions, under, a, few, millimeters, of, water, heterotrophic, bacteria, metabolize, and, consume, oxygen, they, therefore, deplete, the, soil, of, oxygen, and, create, the, need, for, anaerobic, respiration, some, anaerobic, microbial, processes, include, denitrification, sulfate, reduction, and, methanogenesis, and, are, responsible, for, the, release, of, n, 2, nitrogen, h, 2, s, hydrogen, sulfide, and, ch, 4, methane, other, anaerobic, microbial, processes, are, linked, to, changes, in, the, oxidation, state, of, iron, and, manganese, as, a, result, of, anaerobic, decomposition, the, soil, stores, large, amounts, of, organic, carbon, because, the, soil, carbon, sponge, stays, intact, the, reduction, potential, describes, which, way, chemical, reactions, will, proceed, in, oxygen, deficient, soils, and, controls, the, nutrient, cycling, in, flooded, systems, reduction, potential, is, used, to, express, the, likelihood, of, an, environment, to, receive, electrons, and, therefore, become, reduced, for, example, if, a, system, already, has, plenty, of, electrons, anoxic, organic, rich, shale, it, is, reduced, in, a, system, it, will, likely, donate, electrons, to, a, part, that, has, a, low, concentration, of, electrons, or, an, oxidized, environment, to, equilibrate, to, the, chemical, gradient, an, oxidized, environment, has, high, redox, potential, whereas, a, reduced, environment, has, a, low, redox, potential, the, redox, potential, is, controlled, by, the, oxidation, state, of, the, chemical, species, ph, and, the, amount, of, o, 2, there, is, in, the, system, the, oxidizing, environment, accepts, electrons, because, of, the, presence, of, o, 2, which, acts, as, an, electron, acceptor, this, equation, will, tend, to, move, to, the, right, in, acidic, conditions, higher, redox, potentials, are, found, at, lower, ph, levels, bacteria, heterotrophic, organisms, consume, oxygen, while, decomposing, organic, material, this, depletes, the, soils, of, oxygen, thus, decreasing, the, redox, potential, at, high, redox, potential, the, oxidized, form, of, iron, ferric, iron, fe, 3, will, be, deposited, commonly, as, hematite, in, low, redox, conditions, decomposition, rates, decrease, and, the, deposition, of, ferrous, iron, fe, 2, increase, by, using, analytical, geochemical, tools, such, as, x, ray, fluorescence, or, inductively, coupled, mass, spectrometry, the, two, forms, of, fe, fe, 2, and, fe, 3, can, be, measured, in, ancient, rocks, therefore, determining, the, redox, potential, for, ancient, soils, such, a, study, was, done, on, permian, through, triassic, rocks, 300, 200, million, years, old, in, japan, and, british, columbia, the, geologists, found, hematite, throughout, the, early, and, middle, permian, but, began, to, find, the, reduced, form, of, iron, in, pyrite, within, the, ancient, soils, near, the, end, of, the, permian, and, into, the, triassic, these, results, suggest, that, conditions, became, less, oxygen, rich, even, anoxic, during, the, late, permian, which, eventually, led, to, the, greatest, extinction, in, earth, s, history, the, p, t, extinction, decomposition, in, anoxic, or, reduced, soils, is, also, carried, out, by, sulfur, reducing, bacteria, which, instead, of, o, 2, use, so, 2, 4, as, an, electron, acceptor, and, produce, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, process, the, h, 2, s, gas, percolates, upwards, and, reacts, with, fe, 2, and, precipitates, pyrite, acting, as, a, trap, for, the, toxic, h, 2, s, gas, however, h, 2, s, is, still, a, large, fraction, of, emissions, from, wetland, soils, in, most, freshwater, wetlands, there, is, little, sulfate, so, 2, 4, so, methanogenesis, becomes, the, dominant, form, of, decomposition, by, methanogenic, bacteria, only, when, sulfate, is, depleted, acetate, a, compound, that, is, a, byproduct, of, fermenting, cellulose, is, split, by, methanogenic, bacteria, to, produce, methane, ch, 4, and, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, are, released, to, the, atmosphere, methane, is, also, released, during, the, reduction, of, co, 2, by, the, same, bacteria, in, the, pedosphere, it, is, safe, to, assume, that, gases, are, in, equilibrium, with, the, atmosphere, because, plant, roots, and, soil, microbes, release, co, 2, to, the, soil, the, concentration, of, bicarbonate, hco, 3, in, soil, waters, is, much, greater, than, that, in, equilibrium, with, the, atmosphere, the, high, concentration, of, co, 2, and, the, occurrence, of, metals, in, soil, solutions, results, in, lower, ph, levels, in, the, soil, gases, that, escape, from, the, pedosphere, to, the, atmosphere, include, the, gaseous, byproducts, of, carbonate, dissolution, decomposition, redox, reactions, and, microbial, photosynthesis, the, main, inputs, from, the, atmosphere, are, aeolian, sedimentation, rainfall, and, gas, diffusion, eolian, sedimentation, includes, anything, that, can, be, entrained, by, wind, or, that, stays, suspended, in, air, and, includes, a, wide, variety, of, aerosol, particles, biological, particles, like, pollen, and, dust, particles, nitrogen, is, the, most, abundant, constituent, in, rain, after, water, as, water, vapor, utilizes, aerosol, particles, to, nucleate, rain, droplets, soil, is, well, developed, in, the, forest, as, suggested, by, the, thick, humus, layers, rich, diversity, of, large, trees, and, animals, that, live, there, forest, soils, can, form, a, thick, soil, carbon, sponge, in, forests, precipitation, exceeds, evapotranspiration, which, results, in, an, excess, of, water, that, percolates, downward, through, the, soil, layers, slow, rates, of, decomposition, leads, to, large, amounts, of, fulvic, acid, greatly, enhancing, chemical, weathering, the, downward, percolation, in, conjunction, with, chemical, weathering, leaches, mg, fe, and, aluminium, al, from, the, soil, and, transports, them, downward, a, process, known, as, podzolization, this, process, leads, to, marked, contrasts, in, the, appearance, and, chemistry, of, the, soil, layers, tropical, forests, receive, more, insolation, and, rainfall, over, longer, growing, seasons, than, any, other, environment, on, earth, with, these, elevated, temperatures, insolation, and, rainfall, biomass, is, extremely, productive, leading, to, the, production, of, as, much, as, 800, grams, of, carbon, per, square, meter, per, year, 8, tons, of, c, hectare, year, higher, temperatures, and, larger, amounts, of, water, contribute, to, higher, rates, of, chemical, weathering, increased, rates, of, decomposition, cause, smaller, amounts, of, fulvic, acid, to, percolate, and, leach, metals, from, the, zone, of, active, weathering, thus, in, stark, contrast, to, soil, in, temperate, forests, tropical, forests, have, little, to, no, podzolization, and, therefore, do, not, have, marked, visual, and, chemical, contrasts, with, the, soil, layers, instead, the, mobile, metals, mg, fe, and, al, are, precipitated, as, oxide, minerals, giving, the, soil, a, rusty, red, color, precipitation, in, grasslands, is, equal, to, or, less, than, evapotranspiration, and, causes, soil, development, to, operate, in, relative, drought, leaching, and, migration, of, weathering, products, is, therefore, decreased, large, amounts, of, evaporation, cause, a, buildup, of, calcium, ca, and, other, large, cations, flocculate, clay, minerals, and, fulvic, acids, in, the, upper, soil, profile, low, amounts, of, precipitation, and, high, levels, of, evapotranspiration, limit, the, downward, percolation, of, water, and, organic, acids, reducing, chemical, weathering, and, soil, development, the, depth, to, the, maximum, concentration, of, clay, increases, in, areas, of, increased, precipitation, and, leaching, when, leaching, is, decreased, the, calcium, precipitates, as, calcite, caco, 3, in, the, lower, soil, levels, a, layer, known, as, caliche, deserts, behave, similarly, to, grasslands, but, operate, in, constant, drought, as, precipitation, is, less, than, evapotranspiration, chemical, weathering, proceeds, more, slowly, than, in, grasslands, and, beneath, the, caliche, layer, may, be, a, layer, of, gypsum, and, halite, to, study, soils, in, deserts, pedologists, have, used, the, concept, of, chronosequences, to, relate, the, timing, and, development, of, the, soil, layers, it, has, been, shown, that, phosphorus, leaches, very, quickly, from, the, system, and, soil, p, levels, decrease, with, age, furthermore, carbon, buildup, in, the, soils, is, decreased, due, to, slower, decomposition, rates, as, a, result, the, rates, of, carbon, circulation, in, the, biogeochemical, cycle, is, decreased
