in, celestial, mechanics, the, lagrange, points, l, r, n, d, also, lagrangian, points, or, libration, points, are, points, of, equilibrium, for, small, mass, objects, under, the, gravitational, influence, of, two, massive, orbiting, bodies, mathematically, this, involves, the, solution, of, the, restricted, three, body, problem, normally, the, two, massive, bodies, exert, an, unbalanced, gravitational, force, at, a, point, altering, the, orbit, of, whatever, is, at, that, point, at, the, lagrange, points, the, gravitational, forces, of, the, two, large, bodies, and, the, centrifugal, force, balance, each, other, this, can, make, lagrange, points, an, excellent, location, for, satellites, as, orbit, corrections, and, hence, fuel, requirements, needed, to, maintain, the, desired, orbit, are, kept, at, a, minimum, for, any, combination, of, two, orbital, bodies, there, are, five, lagrange, points, l, 1, to, l, 5, all, in, the, orbital, plane, of, the, two, large, bodies, there, are, five, lagrange, points, for, the, sun, earth, system, and, five, different, lagrange, points, for, the, earth, moon, system, l, 1, l, 2, and, l, 3, are, on, the, line, through, the, centers, of, the, two, large, bodies, while, l, 4, and, l, 5, each, act, as, the, third, vertex, of, an, equilateral, triangle, formed, with, the, centers, of, the, two, large, bodies, when, the, mass, ratio, of, the, two, bodies, is, large, enough, the, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, are, stable, points, meaning, that, objects, can, orbit, them, and, that, they, have, a, tendency, to, pull, objects, into, them, several, planets, have, trojan, asteroids, near, their, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, with, respect, to, the, sun, jupiter, has, more, than, one, million, of, these, trojans, some, lagrange, points, are, being, used, for, space, exploration, two, important, lagrange, points, in, the, sun, earth, system, are, l, 1, between, the, sun, and, earth, and, l, 2, on, the, same, line, at, the, opposite, side, of, the, earth, both, are, well, outside, the, moon, s, orbit, currently, an, artificial, satellite, called, the, deep, space, climate, observatory, dscovr, is, located, at, l, 1, to, study, solar, wind, coming, toward, earth, from, the, sun, and, to, monitor, earth, s, climate, by, taking, images, and, sending, them, back, the, james, webb, space, telescope, a, powerful, infrared, space, observatory, is, located, at, l, 2, this, allows, the, satellite, s, large, sunshield, to, protect, the, telescope, from, the, light, and, heat, of, the, sun, earth, and, moon, the, l, 1, and, l, 2, lagrange, points, are, located, about, 1, 500, 000, km, 930, 000, mi, from, earth, the, european, space, agency, s, earlier, gaia, telescope, and, its, newly, launched, euclid, also, occupy, orbits, around, l, 2, gaia, keeps, a, tighter, lissajous, orbit, around, l, 2, while, euclid, follows, a, halo, orbit, similar, to, jwst, each, of, the, space, observatories, benefit, from, being, far, enough, from, earth, s, shadow, to, utilize, solar, panels, for, power, from, not, needing, much, power, or, propellant, for, station, keeping, from, not, being, subjected, to, the, earth, s, magnetospheric, effects, and, from, having, direct, line, of, sight, to, earth, for, data, transfer, the, three, collinear, lagrange, points, l, 1, l, 2, l, 3, were, discovered, by, the, swiss, mathematician, leonhard, euler, around, 1750, a, decade, before, the, italian, born, joseph, louis, lagrange, discovered, the, remaining, two, in, 1772, lagrange, published, an, essay, on, the, three, body, problem, in, the, first, chapter, he, considered, the, general, three, body, problem, from, that, in, the, second, chapter, he, demonstrated, two, special, constant, pattern, solutions, the, collinear, and, the, equilateral, for, any, three, masses, with, circular, orbits, the, five, lagrange, points, are, labelled, and, defined, as, follows, the, l, 1, point, lies, on, the, line, defined, between, the, two, large, masses, m, 1, and, m, 2, it, is, the, point, where, the, gravitational, attraction, of, m, 2, and, that, of, m, 1, combine, to, produce, an, equilibrium, an, object, that, orbits, the, sun, more, closely, than, earth, would, typically, have, a, shorter, orbital, period, than, earth, but, that, ignores, the, effect, of, earth, s, gravitational, pull, if, the, object, is, directly, between, earth, and, the, sun, then, earth, s, gravity, counteracts, some, of, the, sun, s, pull, on, the, object, increasing, the, object, s, orbital, period, the, closer, to, earth, the, object, is, the, greater, this, effect, is, at, the, l, 1, point, the, object, s, orbital, period, becomes, exactly, equal, to, earth, s, orbital, period, l, 1, is, about, 1, 5, million, kilometers, or, 0, 01, au, from, earth, in, the, direction, of, the, sun, the, l, 2, point, lies, on, the, line, through, the, two, large, masses, beyond, the, smaller, of, the, two, here, the, combined, gravitational, forces, of, the, two, large, masses, balance, the, centrifugal, force, on, a, body, at, l, 2, on, the, opposite, side, of, earth, from, the, sun, the, orbital, period, of, an, object, would, normally, be, greater, than, earth, s, the, extra, pull, of, earth, s, gravity, decreases, the, object, s, orbital, period, and, at, the, l, 2, point, that, orbital, period, becomes, equal, to, earth, s, like, l, 1, l, 2, is, about, 1, 5, million, kilometers, or, 0, 01, au, from, earth, away, from, the, sun, an, example, of, a, spacecraft, designed, to, operate, near, the, earth, sun, l, 2, is, the, james, webb, space, telescope, earlier, examples, include, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, and, its, successor, planck, the, l, 3, point, lies, on, the, line, defined, by, the, two, large, masses, beyond, the, larger, of, the, two, within, the, sun, earth, system, the, l, 3, point, exists, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, a, little, outside, earth, s, orbit, and, slightly, farther, from, the, center, of, the, sun, than, earth, is, this, placement, occurs, because, the, sun, is, also, affected, by, earth, s, gravity, and, so, orbits, around, the, two, bodies, barycenter, which, is, well, inside, the, body, of, the, sun, an, object, at, earth, s, distance, from, the, sun, would, have, an, orbital, period, of, one, year, if, only, the, sun, s, gravity, is, considered, but, an, object, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, from, earth, and, directly, in, line, with, both, feels, earth, s, gravity, adding, slightly, to, the, sun, s, and, therefore, must, orbit, a, little, farther, from, the, barycenter, of, earth, and, sun, in, order, to, have, the, same, 1, year, period, it, is, at, the, l, 3, point, that, the, combined, pull, of, earth, and, sun, causes, the, object, to, orbit, with, the, same, period, as, earth, in, effect, orbiting, an, earth, sun, mass, with, the, earth, sun, barycenter, at, one, focus, of, its, orbit, the, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, lie, at, the, third, vertices, of, the, two, equilateral, triangles, in, the, plane, of, orbit, whose, common, base, is, the, line, between, the, centers, of, the, two, masses, such, that, the, point, lies, 60, ahead, of, l, 4, or, behind, l, 5, the, smaller, mass, with, regard, to, its, orbit, around, the, larger, mass, the, triangular, points, l, 4, and, l, 5, are, stable, equilibria, provided, that, the, ratio, of, m, 1, m, 2, is, greater, than, 24, 96, this, is, the, case, for, the, sun, earth, system, the, sun, jupiter, system, and, by, a, smaller, margin, the, earth, moon, system, when, a, body, at, these, points, is, perturbed, it, moves, away, from, the, point, but, the, factor, opposite, of, that, which, is, increased, or, decreased, by, the, perturbation, either, gravity, or, angular, momentum, induced, speed, will, also, increase, or, decrease, bending, the, object, s, path, into, a, stable, kidney, bean, shaped, orbit, around, the, point, as, seen, in, the, corotating, frame, of, reference, the, points, l, 1, l, 2, and, l, 3, are, positions, of, unstable, equilibrium, any, object, orbiting, at, l, 1, l, 2, or, l, 3, will, tend, to, fall, out, of, orbit, it, is, therefore, rare, to, find, natural, objects, there, and, spacecraft, inhabiting, these, areas, must, employ, a, small, but, critical, amount, of, station, keeping, in, order, to, maintain, their, position, due, to, the, natural, stability, of, l, 4, and, l, 5, it, is, common, for, natural, objects, to, be, found, orbiting, in, those, lagrange, points, of, planetary, systems, objects, that, inhabit, those, points, are, generically, referred, to, as, trojans, or, trojan, asteroids, the, name, derives, from, the, names, that, were, given, to, asteroids, discovered, orbiting, at, the, sun, jupiter, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, which, were, taken, from, mythological, characters, appearing, in, homer, s, iliad, an, epic, poem, set, during, the, trojan, war, asteroids, at, the, l, 4, point, ahead, of, jupiter, are, named, after, greek, characters, in, the, iliad, and, referred, to, as, the, greek, camp, those, at, the, l, 5, point, are, named, after, trojan, characters, and, referred, to, as, the, trojan, camp, both, camps, are, considered, to, be, types, of, trojan, bodies, as, the, sun, and, jupiter, are, the, two, most, massive, objects, in, the, solar, system, there, are, more, known, sun, jupiter, trojans, than, for, any, other, pair, of, bodies, however, smaller, numbers, of, objects, are, known, at, the, lagrange, points, of, other, orbital, systems, objects, which, are, on, horseshoe, orbits, are, sometimes, erroneously, described, as, trojans, but, do, not, occupy, lagrange, points, known, objects, on, horseshoe, orbits, include, 3753, cruithne, with, earth, and, saturn, s, moons, epimetheus, and, janus, lagrange, points, are, the, constant, pattern, solutions, of, the, restricted, three, body, problem, for, example, given, two, massive, bodies, in, orbits, around, their, common, barycenter, there, are, five, positions, in, space, where, a, third, body, of, comparatively, negligible, mass, could, be, placed, so, as, to, maintain, its, position, relative, to, the, two, massive, bodies, this, occurs, because, the, combined, gravitational, forces, of, the, two, massive, bodies, provide, the, exact, centripetal, force, required, to, maintain, the, circular, motion, that, matches, their, orbital, motion, alternatively, when, seen, in, a, rotating, reference, frame, that, matches, the, angular, velocity, of, the, two, co, orbiting, bodies, at, the, lagrange, points, the, combined, gravitational, fields, of, two, massive, bodies, balance, the, centrifugal, pseudo, force, allowing, the, smaller, third, body, to, remain, stationary, in, this, frame, with, respect, to, the, first, two, the, location, of, l, 1, is, the, solution, to, the, following, equation, gravitation, providing, the, centripetal,

where, r, is, the, distance, of, the, l, 1, point, from, the, smaller, object, r, is, the, distance, between, the, two, main, objects, and, m, 1, and, m, 2, are, the, masses, of, the, large, and, small, object, respectively, the, quantity, in, parentheses, on, the, right, is, the, distance, of, l, 1, from, the, center, of, mass, the, solution, for, r, is, the, only, real, root, of, the, following, quintic, function, x, 5, 3, x, 4, 3, 2, x, 3, x, 2, 2, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 5, mu, 3, x, 4, 3, 2, mu, x, 3, mu, x, 2, 2, mu, x, mu, 0, where, m, 2, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, mu, frac, m,

mass, of, the, larger, object, m, 1, then, l, 1, and, l, 2, are, at, approximately, equal, distances, r, from, the, smaller, object, equal, to, the, radius, of, the, hill, sphere, given, by, r, r, 3,

a, body, is, proportional, to, its, mass, divided, by, the, distance, cubed, this, means, that, the, tidal, effect, of, the, smaller, body, at, the, l, 1, or, at, the, l, 2, point, is, about, three, times, of, that, body, we, may, also, write, 2, d, 2, r, 3, 3, 1, d, 1, r, 3, displaystyle, rho, 2, left, frac, d, 2, r, right, 3, approx, 3, rho, 1, left, frac, d, 1, r, right, 3, where, 1, and, 2,

viewed, from, these, two, lagrange, points, the, apparent, sizes, of, the, two, bodies, will, be, similar, especially, if, the, density, of, the, smaller, one, is, about, thrice, that, of, the, larger, as, in, the, case, of, the, earth, and, the, sun, this, distance, can, be, described, as, being, such, that, the, orbital, period, corresponding, to, a, circular, orbit, with, this, distance, as, radius, around, m, 2, in, the, absence, of, m, 1, is, that, of, m, 2, around, m, 1, divided, by, 3, 1, 73, t, s, m, 2, r, t, m, 2, m, 1, r, 3, displaystyle, t, s, m, 2, r, frac, t, m, 2, m, 1, r,

much, smaller, than, the, mass, of, the, larger, object, m, 1, then, l, 2, is, at, approximately, the, radius, of, the, hill, sphere, given, by, r, r, 3, 3, displaystyle, r, approx, r, sqrt, frac, mu, 3, the, same, remarks, about, tidal, influence, and, apparent, size, apply, as, for, the, l, 1, point, for, example, the, angular, radius, of, the, sun, as, viewed, from, l, 2, is, arcsin, 695, 5, 10, 3, 151, 1, 10, 6, 0, 264, whereas, that, of, the, earth, is, arcsin, 6371, 1, 5, 10, 6, 0, 242, looking, toward, the, sun, from, l, 2, one, sees, an, annular, eclipse, it, is, necessary, for, a, spacecraft, like, gaia, to, follow, a, lissajous, orbit, or, a, halo, orbit, around, l, 2, in, order, for, its, solar, panels, to, get, full, sun, the, location, of, l, 3, is, the, solution, to, the, following, equation, gravitation, providing, the, centripetal, force, m, 1, r, r, 2, m, 2, 2, r, r, 2, m, 2, m, 1, m, 2, r, r, r, m, 1, m, 2, r, 3, displaystyle, frac, m, 1, left, r, r, right, 2, frac, m, 2, left, 2r, r, right, 2, left, frac, m, 2, m, 1, m, 2, r, r, r, right, frac, m, 1, m, 2, r, 3, with, parameters, m, 1, m, 2, and, r, defined, as, for, the, l, 1, and, l, 2, cases, and, r, being, defined, such, that, the, distance, of, l, 3, from, the, centre, of, the, larger, object, is, r, r, if, the, mass, of, the, smaller, object, m, 2, is, much, smaller, than, the, mass, of, the, larger, object, m, 1, then, r, r, 7, 12, displaystyle, r, approx, r, tfrac, 7, 12, mu, thus, the, distance, from, l, 3, to, the, larger, object, is, less, than, the, separation, of, the, two, objects, although, the, distance, between, l, 3, and, the, barycentre, is, greater, than, the, distance, between, the, smaller, object, and, the, barycentre, the, reason, these, points, are, in, balance, is, that, at, l, 4, and, l, 5, the, distances, to, the, two, masses, are, equal, accordingly, the, gravitational, forces, from, the, two, massive, bodies, are, in, the, same, ratio, as, the, masses, of, the, two, bodies, and, so, the, resultant, force, acts, through, the, barycenter, of, the, system, additionally, the, geometry, of, the, triangle, ensures, that, the, resultant, acceleration, is, to, the, distance, from, the, barycenter, in, the, same, ratio, as, for, the, two, massive, bodies, the, barycenter, being, both, the, center, of, mass, and, center, of, rotation, of, the, three, body, system, this, resultant, force, is, exactly, that, required, to, keep, the, smaller, body, at, the, lagrange, point, in, orbital, equilibrium, with, the, other, two, larger, bodies, of, the, system, indeed, the, third, body, needs, to, have, negligible, mass, the, general, triangular, configuration, was, discovered, by, lagrange, working, on, the, three, body, problem, the, radial, acceleration, a, of, an, object, in, orbit, at, a, point, along, the, line, passing, through, both, bodies, is, given, by, a, g, m, 1, r, 2, sgn, r, g, m, 2, r, r, 2, sgn, r, r, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, m, 2, r, r, 3,

large, body, m, 1, r, is, the, distance, between, the, two, main, objects, and, sgn, x, is, the, sign, function, of, x, the, terms, in, this, function, represent, respectively, force, from, m, 1, force, from, m, 2, and, centripetal, force, the, points, l, 3, l, 1, l, 2, occur, where, the, acceleration, is, zero, see, chart, at, right, positive, acceleration, is, acceleration, towards, the, right, of, the, chart, and, negative, acceleration, is, towards, the, left, that, is, why, acceleration, has, opposite, signs, on, opposite, sides, of, the, gravity, wells, although, the, l, 1, l, 2, and, l, 3, points, are, nominally, unstable, there, are, quasi, stable, periodic, orbits, called, halo, orbits, around, these, points, in, a, three, body, system, a, full, n, body, dynamical, system, such, as, the, solar, system, does, not, contain, these, periodic, orbits, but, does, contain, quasi, periodic, i, e, bounded, but, not, precisely, repeating, orbits, following, lissajous, curve, trajectories, these, quasi, periodic, lissajous, orbits, are, what, most, of, lagrangian, point, space, missions, have, used, until, now, although, they, are, not, perfectly, stable, a, modest, effort, of, station, keeping, keeps, a, spacecraft, in, a, desired, lissajous, orbit, for, a, long, time, for, sun, earth, l, 1, missions, it, is, preferable, for, the, spacecraft, to, be, in, a, large, amplitude, 100, 000, 200, 000, km, or, 62, 000, 124, 000, mi, lissajous, orbit, around, l, 1, than, to, stay, at, l, 1, because, the, line, between, sun, and, earth, has, increased, solar, interference, on, earth, spacecraft, communications, similarly, a, large, amplitude, lissajous, orbit, around, l, 2, keeps, a, probe, out, of, earth, s, shadow, and, therefore, ensures, continuous, illumination, of, its, solar, panels, the, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, are, stable, provided, that, the, mass, of, the, primary, body, e, g, the, earth, is, at, least, 25, times, the, mass, of, the, secondary, body, e, g, the, moon, the, earth, is, over, 81, times, the, mass, of, the, moon, the, moon, is, 1, 23, of, the, mass, of, the, earth, although, the, l, 4, and, l, 5, points, are, found, at, the, top, of, a, hill, as, in, the, effective, potential, contour, plot, above, they, are, nonetheless, stable, the, reason, for, the, stability, is, a, second, order, effect, as, a, body, moves, away, from, the, exact, lagrange, position, coriolis, acceleration, which, depends, on, the, velocity, of, an, orbiting, object, and, cannot, be, modeled, as, a, contour, map, curves, the, trajectory, into, a, path, around, rather, than, away, from, the, point, because, the, source, of, stability, is, the, coriolis, force, the, resulting, orbits, can, be, stable, but, generally, are, not, planar, but, three, dimensional, they, lie, on, a, warped, surface, intersecting, the, ecliptic, plane, the, kidney, shaped, orbits, typically, shown, nested, around, l, 4, and, l, 5, are, the, projections, of, the, orbits, on, a, plane, e, g, the, ecliptic, and, not, the, full, 3, d, orbits, this, table, lists, sample, values, of, l, 1, l, 2, and, l, 3, within, the, solar, system, calculations, assume, the, two, bodies, orbit, in, a, perfect, circle, with, separation, equal, to, the, semimajor, axis, and, no, other, bodies, are, nearby, distances, are, measured, from, the, larger, body, s, center, of, mass, but, see, barycenter, especially, in, the, case, of, moon, and, jupiter, with, l, 3, showing, a, negative, direction, the, percentage, columns, show, the, distance, from, the, orbit, compared, to, the, semimajor, axis, e, g, for, the, moon, l, 1, is, 326, 400, km, from, earth, s, center, which, is, 84, 9, of, the, earth, moon, distance, or, 15, 1, in, front, of, earthwards, from, the, moon, l, 2, is, located, 448, 900, km, from, earth, s, center, which, is, 116, 8, of, the, earth, moon, distance, or, 16, 8, beyond, the, moon, and, l, 3, is, located, 381, 700, km, from, earth,

sun, earth, system, objects, here, are, never, shadowed, by, earth, or, the, moon, and, if, observing, earth, always, view, the, sunlit, hemisphere, the, first, mission, of, this, type, was, the, 1978, international, sun, earth, explorer, 3, isee, 3, mission, used, as, an, interplanetary, early, warning, storm, monitor, for, solar, disturbances, since, june, 2015, dscovr, has, orbited, the, l, 1, point, conversely, it, is, also, useful, for, space, based, solar, telescopes, because, it, provides, an, uninterrupted, view, of, the, sun, and, any, space, weather, including, the, solar, wind, and, coronal, mass, ejections, reaches, l, 1, up, to, an, hour, before, earth, solar, and, heliospheric, missions, currently, located, around, l, 1, include, the, solar, and, heliospheric, observatory, wind, aditya, l1, mission, and, the, advanced, composition, explorer, planned, missions, include, the, interstellar, mapping, and, acceleration, probe, imap, and, the, neo, surveyor, sun, earth, l, 2, is, a, good, spot, for, space, based, observatories, because, an, object, around, l, 2, will, maintain, the, same, relative, position, with, respect, to, the, sun, and, earth, shielding, and, calibration, are, much, simpler, it, is, however, slightly, beyond, the, reach, of, earth, s, umbra, so, solar, radiation, is, not, completely, blocked, at, l, 2, spacecraft, generally, orbit, around, l, 2, avoiding, partial, eclipses, of, the, sun, to, maintain, a, constant, temperature, from, locations, near, l, 2, the, sun, earth, and, moon, are, relatively, close, together, in, the, sky, this, means, that, a, large, sunshade, with, the, telescope, on, the, dark, side, can, allow, the, telescope, to, cool, passively, to, around, 50, k, this, is, especially, helpful, for, infrared, astronomy, and, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, james, webb, space, telescope, was, positioned, in, a, halo, orbit, about, l, 2, on, january, 24, 2022, sun, earth, l, 1, and, l, 2, are, saddle, points, and, exponentially, unstable, with, time, constant, of, roughly, 23, days, satellites, at, these, points, will, wander, off, in, a, few, months, unless, course, corrections, are, made, sun, earth, l, 3, was, a, popular, place, to, put, a, counter, earth, in, pulp, science, fiction, and, comic, books, despite, the, fact, that, the, existence, of, a, planetary, body, in, this, location, had, been, understood, as, an, impossibility, once, orbital, mechanics, and, the, perturbations, of, planets, upon, each, other, s, orbits, came, to, be, understood, long, before, the, space, age, the, influence, of, an, earth, sized, body, on, other, planets, would, not, have, gone, undetected, nor, would, the, fact, that, the, foci, of, earth, s, orbital, ellipse, would, not, have, been, in, their, expected, places, due, to, the, mass, of, the, counter, earth, the, sun, earth, l, 3, however, is, a, weak, saddle, point, and, exponentially, unstable, with, time, constant, of, roughly, 150, years, moreover, it, could, not, contain, a, natural, object, large, or, small, for, very, long, because, the, gravitational, forces, of, the, other, planets, are, stronger, than, that, of, earth, for, example, venus, comes, within, 0, 3, au, of, this, l, 3, every, 20, months, a, spacecraft, orbiting, near, sun, earth, l, 3, would, be, able, to, closely, monitor, the, evolution, of, active, sunspot, regions, before, they, rotate, into, a, geoeffective, position, so, that, a, seven, day, early, warning, could, be, issued, by, the, noaa, space, weather, prediction, center, moreover, a, satellite, near, sun, earth, l, 3, would, provide, very, important, observations, not, only, for, earth, forecasts, but, also, for, deep, space, support, mars, predictions, and, for, crewed, missions, to, near, earth, asteroids, in, 2010, spacecraft, transfer, trajectories, to, sun, earth, l, 3, were, studied, and, several, designs, were, considered, earth, moon, l, 1, allows, comparatively, easy, access, to, lunar, and, earth, orbits, with, minimal, change, in, velocity, and, this, has, as, an, advantage, to, position, a, habitable, space, station, intended, to, help, transport, cargo, and, personnel, to, the, moon, and, back, the, smart, 1, mission, passed, through, the, l, 1, lagrangian, point, on, 11, november, 2004, and, passed, into, the, area, dominated, by, the, moon, s, gravitational, influence, earth, moon, l, 2, has, been, used, for, a, communications, satellite, covering, the, moon, s, far, side, for, example, queqiao, launched, in, 2018, and, would, be, an, ideal, location, for, a, propellant, depot, as, part, of, the, proposed, depot, based, space, transportation, architecture, earth, moon, l, 4, and, l, 5, are, the, locations, for, the, kordylewski, dust, clouds, the, l5, society, s, name, comes, from, the, l, 4, and, l, 5, lagrangian, points, in, the, earth, moon, system, proposed, as, locations, for, their, huge, rotating, space, habitats, both, positions, are, also, proposed, for, communication, satellites, covering, the, moon, alike, communication, satellites, in, geosynchronous, orbit, cover, the, earth, scientists, at, the, b612, foundation, were, planning, to, use, venus, s, l, 3, point, to, position, their, planned, sentinel, telescope, which, aimed, to, look, back, towards, earth, s, orbit, and, compile, a, catalogue, of, near, earth, asteroids, in, 2017, the, idea, of, positioning, a, magnetic, dipole, shield, at, the, sun, mars, l, 1, point, for, use, as, an, artificial, magnetosphere, for, mars, was, discussed, at, a, nasa, conference, the, idea, is, that, this, would, protect, the, planet, s, atmosphere, from, the, sun, s, radiation, and, solar, winds, j, r, stockton, includes, translations, of, lagrange, s, essai, and, of, two, related, papers, by, euler
