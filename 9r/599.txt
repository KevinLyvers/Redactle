oil, shale, is, an, organic, rich, fine, grained, sedimentary, rock, containing, kerogen, a, solid, mixture, of, organic, chemical, compounds, from, which, liquid, hydrocarbons, can, be, produced, in, addition, to, kerogen, general, composition, of, oil, shales, constitutes, inorganic, substance, and, bitumens, based, on, their, deposition, environment, oil, shales, are, classified, as, marine, lacustrine, and, terrestrial, oil, shales, oil, shales, differ, from, oil, bearing, shales, shale, deposits, that, contain, petroleum, tight, oil, that, is, sometimes, produced, from, drilled, wells, examples, of, oil, bearing, shales, are, the, bakken, formation, pierre, shale, niobrara, formation, and, eagle, ford, formation, accordingly, shale, oil, produced, from, oil, shale, should, not, be, confused, with, tight, oil, which, is, also, frequently, called, shale, oil, a, 2016, estimate, of, global, deposits, set, the, total, world, resources, of, oil, shale, equivalent, of, 6, 05, trillion, barrels, 962, billion, cubic, metres, of, oil, in, place, oil, shale, has, gained, attention, as, a, potential, abundant, source, of, oil, however, the, various, attempts, to, develop, oil, shale, deposits, have, had, limited, success, only, estonia, and, china, have, well, established, oil, shale, industries, and, brazil, germany, and, russia, utilize, oil, shale, to, some, extent, oil, shale, can, be, burned, directly, in, furnaces, as, a, low, grade, fuel, for, power, generation, and, district, heating, or, used, as, a, raw, material, in, chemical, and, construction, materials, processing, heating, oil, shale, to, a, sufficiently, high, temperature, causes, the, chemical, process, of, pyrolysis, to, yield, a, vapor, upon, cooling, the, vapor, the, liquid, unconventional, oil, called, shale, oil, is, separated, from, combustible, oil, shale, gas, shale, oil, is, a, substitute, for, conventional, crude, oil, however, extracting, shale, oil, is, costlier, than, the, production, of, conventional, crude, oil, both, financially, and, in, terms, of, its, environmental, impact, oil, shale, mining, and, processing, raise, a, number, of, environmental, concerns, such, as, land, use, waste, disposal, water, use, waste, water, management, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, air, pollution, oil, shale, an, organic, rich, sedimentary, rock, belongs, to, the, group, of, sapropel, fuels, it, does, not, have, a, definite, geological, definition, nor, a, specific, chemical, formula, and, its, seams, do, not, always, have, discrete, boundaries, oil, shales, vary, considerably, in, their, mineral, content, chemical, composition, age, type, of, kerogen, and, depositional, history, and, not, all, oil, shales, would, necessarily, be, classified, as, shales, in, the, strict, sense, according, to, the, petrologist, adrian, c, hutton, of, the, university, of, wollongong, oil, shales, are, not, geological, nor, geochemically, distinctive, rock, but, rather, economic, term, their, common, defining, feature, is, low, solubility, in, low, boiling, organic, solvents, and, generation, of, liquid, organic, products, on, thermal, decomposition, geologists, can, classify, oil, shales, on, the, basis, of, their, composition, as, carbonate, rich, shales, siliceous, shales, or, cannel, shales, oil, shale, differs, from, bitumen, impregnated, rocks, other, so, called, unconventional, resources, such, as, oil, sands, and, petroleum, reservoir, rocks, humic, coals, and, carbonaceous, shale, while, oil, sands, do, originate, from, the, biodegradation, of, oil, heat, and, pressure, have, not, yet, transformed, the, kerogen, in, oil, shale, into, petroleum, which, means, its, maturation, does, not, exceed, early, mesocatagenetic, oil, shales, differ, also, from, oil, bearing, shales, shale, deposits, that, contain, tight, oil, that, is, sometimes, produced, from, drilled, wells, examples, of, oil, bearing, shales, are, the, bakken, formation, pierre, shale, niobrara, formation, and, eagle, ford, formation, accordingly, shale, oil, produced, from, oil, shale, should, not, be, confused, with, tight, oil, which, is, called, also, frequently, shale, oil, general, composition, of, oil, shales, constitutes, inorganic, matrix, bitumens, and, kerogen, while, the, bitumen, portion, of, oil, shales, is, soluble, in, carbon, disulfide, the, kerogen, portion, is, insoluble, in, carbon, disulfide, and, may, contain, iron, vanadium, nickel, molybdenum, and, uranium, oil, shale, contains, a, lower, percentage, of, organic, matter, than, coal, in, commercial, grades, of, oil, shale, the, ratio, of, organic, matter, to, mineral, matter, lies, approximately, between, 0, 75, 5, and, 1, 5, 5, at, the, same, time, the, organic, matter, in, oil, shale, has, an, atomic, ratio, of, hydrogen, to, carbon, h, c, approximately, 1, 2, to, 1, 8, times, lower, than, for, crude, oil, and, about, 1, 5, to, 3, times, higher, than, for, coals, the, organic, components, of, oil, shale, derive, from, a, variety, of, organisms, such, as, the, remains, of, algae, spores, pollen, plant, cuticles, and, corky, fragments, of, herbaceous, and, woody, plants, and, cellular, debris, from, other, aquatic, and, land, plants, some, deposits, contain, significant, fossils, germany, s, messel, pit, has, the, status, of, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, mineral, matter, in, oil, shale, includes, various, fine, grained, silicates, and, carbonates, inorganic, matrix, can, contain, quartz, feldspar, clay, mainly, illite, and, chlorite, carbonate, calcite, and, dolomite, pyrite, and, some, other, minerals, another, classification, known, as, the, van, krevelen, diagram, assigns, kerogen, types, depending, on, the, hydrogen, carbon, and, oxygen, content, of, oil, shales, original, organic, matter, the, most, commonly, used, classification, of, oil, shales, developed, between, 1987, and, 1991, by, adrian, c, hutton, adapts, petrographic, terms, from, coal, terminology, this, classification, designates, oil, shales, as, terrestrial, lacustrine, lake, bottom, deposited, or, marine, ocean, bottom, deposited, based, on, the, environment, of, the, initial, biomass, deposit, known, oil, shales, are, predominantly, of, aquatic, marine, lacustrine, origin, hutton, s, classification, scheme, has, proven, useful, in, estimating, the, yield, and, composition, of, the, extracted, oil, as, source, rocks, for, most, conventional, oil, reservoirs, oil, shale, deposits, are, found, in, all, world, oil, provinces, although, most, of, them, are, too, deep, to, be, exploited, economically, as, with, all, oil, and, gas, resources, analysts, distinguish, between, oil, shale, resources, and, oil, shale, reserves, resources, refer, to, all, oil, shale, deposits, while, reserves, represent, those, deposits, from, which, producers, can, extract, oil, shale, economically, using, existing, technology, since, extraction, technologies, develop, continuously, planners, can, only, estimate, the, amount, of, recoverable, kerogen, although, resources, of, oil, shale, occur, in, many, countries, only, 33, countries, possess, known, deposits, of, potential, economic, value, well, explored, deposits, potentially, classifiable, as, reserves, include, the, green, river, deposits, in, the, western, united, states, the, tertiary, deposits, in, queensland, australia, deposits, in, sweden, and, estonia, the, el, lajjun, deposit, in, jordan, and, deposits, in, france, germany, brazil, china, southern, mongolia, and, russia, these, deposits, have, given, rise, to, expectations, of, yielding, at, least, 40, liters, of, shale, oil, per, tonne, of, oil, shale, using, the, fischer, assay, a, 2016, estimate, set, the, total, world, resources, of, oil, shale, equivalent, to, yield, of, 6, 05, trillion, barrels, 962, billion, cubic, metres, of, shale, oil, with, the, largest, resource, deposits, in, the, united, states, accounting, more, than, 80, of, the, world, total, resource, for, comparison, at, the, same, time, the, world, s, proven, oil, reserves, are, estimated, to, be, 1, 6976, trillion, barrels, 269, 90, billion, cubic, metres, the, largest, deposits, in, the, world, occur, in, the, united, states, in, the, green, river, formation, which, covers, portions, of, colorado, utah, and, wyoming, about, 70, of, this, resource, lies, on, land, owned, or, managed, by, the, united, states, federal, government, deposits, in, the, united, states, constitute, more, than, 80, of, world, resources, other, significant, resource, holders, being, china, russia, and, brazil, the, amount, of, economically, recoverable, oil, shale, is, unknown, humans, have, used, oil, shale, as, a, fuel, since, prehistoric, times, since, it, generally, burns, without, any, processing, around, 3000, bc, rock, oil, was, used, in, mesopotamia, for, road, construction, and, making, architectural, adhesives, britons, of, the, iron, age, used, tractable, oil, shales, to, fashion, cists, for, burial, or, just, polish, it, to, create, ornaments, in, the, 10th, century, the, arab, physician, masawaih, al, mardini, mesue, the, younger, described, a, method, of, extraction, of, oil, from, some, kind, of, bituminous, shale, the, first, patent, for, extracting, oil, from, oil, shale, was, british, crown, patent, 330, granted, in, 1694, to, martin, eele, thomas, hancock, and, william, portlock, who, had, found, a, way, to, extract, and, make, great, quantities, of, pitch, tarr, and, oyle, out, of, a, sort, of, stone, modern, industrial, mining, of, oil, shale, began, in, 1837, in, autun, france, followed, by, exploitation, in, scotland, germany, and, several, other, countries, operations, during, the, 19th, century, focused, on, the, production, of, kerosene, lamp, oil, and, paraffin, these, products, helped, supply, the, growing, demand, for, lighting, that, arose, during, the, industrial, revolution, supplied, from, scottish, oil, shales, fuel, oil, lubricating, oil, and, grease, and, ammonium, sulfate, were, also, produced, scottish, production, peaked, in, around, 1913, operating, 120, oil, shale, works, producing, 3, 332, 000, tonnes, of, oil, shale, generating, around, 2, of, the, global, production, of, petroleum, the, scottish, oil, shale, industry, expanded, immediately, before, world, war, i, partly, because, of, limited, access, to, conventional, petroleum, resources, and, the, mass, production, of, automobiles, and, trucks, which, accompanied, an, increase, in, gasoline, consumption, but, mostly, because, the, british, admiralty, required, a, reliable, fuel, source, for, their, fleet, as, war, in, europe, loomed, although, the, estonian, and, chinese, oil, shale, industries, continued, to, grow, after, world, war, ii, most, other, countries, abandoned, their, projects, because, of, high, processing, costs, and, the, availability, of, cheaper, petroleum, following, the, 1973, oil, crisis, world, production, of, oil, shale, reached, a, peak, of, 46, million, tonnes, in, 1980, before, falling, to, about, 16, million, tonnes, in, 2000, because, of, competition, from, cheap, conventional, petroleum, in, the, 1980s, on, 2, may, 1982, known, in, some, circles, as, black, sunday, exxon, canceled, its, us, 5, billion, colony, shale, oil, project, near, parachute, colorado, because, of, low, oil, prices, and, increased, expenses, laying, off, more, than, 2, 000, workers, and, leaving, a, trail, of, home, foreclosures, and, small, business, bankruptcies, in, 1986, president, ronald, reagan, signed, into, law, the, consolidated, omnibus, budget, reconciliation, act, of, 1985, which, among, other, things, abolished, the, united, states, synthetic, liquid, fuels, program, the, global, oil, shale, industry, began, to, revive, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, in, 2003, an, oil, shale, development, program, restarted, in, the, united, states, authorities, introduced, a, commercial, leasing, program, permitting, the, extraction, of, oil, shale, and, oil, sands, on, federal, lands, in, 2005, in, accordance, with, the, energy, policy, act, of, 2005, as, of, 2008, oil, shale, is, utilized, primarily, in, brazil, china, estonia, and, to, some, extent, in, germany, and, russia, several, additional, countries, started, assessing, their, reserves, or, had, built, experimental, production, plants, while, others, had, phased, out, their, oil, shale, industry, oil, shale, serves, for, oil, production, in, estonia, brazil, and, china, for, power, generation, in, estonia, china, and, germany, for, cement, production, in, estonia, germany, and, china, and, for, use, in, chemical, industries, in, china, estonia, and, russia, as, of, 2009, 80, of, oil, shale, used, globally, is, extracted, in, estonia, mainly, because, estonia, uses, several, oil, shale, fired, power, plants, which, has, an, installed, capacity, of, 2, 967, megawatts, mw, by, comparison, china, s, oil, shale, power, plants, have, an, installed, capacity, of, 12, mw, and, germany, s, have, 9, 9, mw, a, 470, mw, oil, shale, power, plant, in, jordan, is, under, construction, as, of, 2020, israel, romania, and, russia, have, in, the, past, run, power, plants, fired, by, oil, shale, but, have, shut, them, down, or, switched, to, other, fuel, sources, such, as, natural, gas, other, countries, such, as, egypt, have, had, plans, to, construct, power, plants, fired, by, oil, shale, while, canada, and, turkey, had, plans, to, burn, oil, shale, along, with, coal, for, power, generation, oil, shale, serves, as, the, main, fuel, for, power, generation, only, in, estonia, where, 90, 3, of, country, s, electrical, generation, in, 2016, was, produced, from, oil, shale, according, to, the, world, energy, council, in, 2008, the, total, production, of, shale, oil, from, oil, shale, was, 930, 000, tonnes, equal, to, 17, 700, barrels, per, day, 2, 810, m, 3, d, of, which, china, produced, 375, 000, tonnes, estonia, 355, 000, tonnes, and, brazil, 200, 000, tonnes, in, comparison, production, of, the, conventional, oil, and, natural, gas, liquids, in, 2008, amounted, 3, 95, billion, tonnes, or, 82, 1, million, barrels, per, day, 13, 1, 10, 6, m, 3, d, most, exploitation, of, oil, shale, involves, mining, followed, by, shipping, elsewhere, after, which, the, shale, is, burned, directly, to, generate, electricity, or, undertakes, further, processing, the, most, common, methods, of, mining, involve, open, pit, mining, and, strip, mining, these, procedures, remove, most, of, the, overlying, material, to, expose, the, deposits, of, oil, shale, and, become, practical, when, the, deposits, occur, near, the, surface, underground, mining, of, oil, shale, which, removes, less, of, the, overlying, material, employs, the, room, and, pillar, method, the, extraction, of, the, useful, components, of, oil, shale, usually, takes, place, above, ground, ex, situ, processing, although, several, newer, technologies, perform, this, underground, on, site, or, in, situ, processing, in, either, case, the, chemical, process, of, pyrolysis, converts, the, kerogen, in, the, oil, shale, to, shale, oil, synthetic, crude, oil, and, oil, shale, gas, most, conversion, technologies, involve, heating, shale, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, to, a, temperature, at, which, kerogen, decomposes, pyrolyses, into, gas, condensable, oil, and, a, solid, residue, this, usually, takes, place, between, 450, c, 842, f, and, 500, c, 932, f, the, process, of, decomposition, begins, at, relatively, low, temperatures, 300, c, or, 572, f, but, proceeds, more, rapidly, and, more, completely, at, higher, temperatures, in, situ, processing, involves, heating, the, oil, shale, underground, such, technologies, can, potentially, extract, more, oil, from, a, given, area, of, land, than, ex, situ, processes, since, they, can, access, the, material, at, greater, depths, than, surface, mines, can, several, companies, have, patented, methods, for, in, situ, retorting, however, most, of, these, methods, remain, in, the, experimental, phase, two, in, situ, processes, could, be, used, true, in, situ, processing, does, not, involve, mining, the, oil, shale, while, modified, in, situ, processing, involves, removing, part, of, the, oil, shale, and, bringing, it, to, the, surface, for, modified, in, situ, retorting, in, order, to, create, permeability, for, gas, flow, in, a, rubble, chimney, explosives, rubblize, the, oil, shale, deposit, hundreds, of, patents, for, oil, shale, retorting, technologies, exist, however, only, a, few, dozen, have, undergone, testing, by, 2006, only, four, technologies, remained, in, commercial, use, kiviter, galoter, fushun, and, petrosix, oil, shale, is, utilized, as, a, fuel, for, thermal, power, plants, burning, it, like, coal, to, drive, steam, turbines, some, of, these, plants, employ, the, resulting, heat, for, district, heating, of, homes, and, businesses, in, addition, to, its, use, as, a, fuel, oil, shale, may, also, serve, in, the, production, of, specialty, carbon, fibers, adsorbent, carbons, carbon, black, phenols, resins, glues, tanning, agents, mastic, road, bitumen, cement, bricks, construction, and, decorative, blocks, soil, additives, fertilizers, rock, wool, insulation, glass, and, pharmaceutical, products, however, oil, shale, use, for, production, of, these, items, remains, small, or, only, in, experimental, development, some, oil, shales, yield, sulfur, ammonia, alumina, soda, ash, uranium, and, nahcolite, as, shale, oil, extraction, byproducts, between, 1946, and, 1952, a, marine, type, of, dictyonema, shale, served, for, uranium, production, in, sillam, e, estonia, and, between, 1950, and, 1989, sweden, used, alum, shale, for, the, same, purposes, oil, shale, gas, has, served, as, a, substitute, for, natural, gas, but, as, of, 2009, producing, oil, shale, gas, as, a, natural, gas, substitute, remained, economically, infeasible, the, shale, oil, derived, from, oil, shale, does, not, directly, substitute, for, crude, oil, in, all, applications, it, may, contain, higher, concentrations, of, olefins, oxygen, and, nitrogen, than, conventional, crude, oil, some, shale, oils, may, have, higher, sulfur, or, arsenic, content, by, comparison, with, west, texas, intermediate, the, benchmark, standard, for, crude, oil, in, the, futures, contract, market, the, green, river, shale, oil, sulfur, content, ranges, from, near, 0, to, 4, 9, in, average, 0, 76, where, west, texas, intermediate, s, sulfur, content, has, a, maximum, of, 0, 42, the, sulfur, content, in, shale, oil, from, jordan, s, oil, shales, may, be, as, high, as, 9, 5, the, arsenic, content, for, example, becomes, an, issue, for, green, river, formation, oil, shale, the, higher, concentrations, of, these, materials, means, that, the, oil, must, undergo, considerable, upgrading, hydrotreating, before, serving, as, oil, refinery, feedstock, above, ground, retorting, processes, tended, to, yield, a, lower, api, gravity, shale, oil, than, the, in, situ, processes, shale, oil, serves, best, for, producing, middle, distillates, such, as, kerosene, jet, fuel, and, diesel, fuel, worldwide, demand, for, these, middle, distillates, particularly, for, diesel, fuels, increased, rapidly, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, however, appropriate, refining, processes, equivalent, to, hydrocracking, can, transform, shale, oil, into, a, lighter, range, hydrocarbon, gasoline, the, various, attempts, to, develop, oil, shale, deposits, have, succeeded, only, when, the, cost, of, shale, oil, production, in, a, given, region, comes, in, below, the, price, of, crude, oil, or, its, other, substitutes, break, even, price, according, to, a, 2005, survey, conducted, by, the, rand, corporation, the, cost, of, producing, a, barrel, of, oil, at, a, surface, retorting, complex, in, the, united, states, comprising, a, mine, retorting, plant, upgrading, plant, supporting, utilities, and, spent, shale, reclamation, would, range, between, us, 70, 95, 440, 600, m, 3, adjusted, to, 2005, values, this, estimate, considers, varying, levels, of, kerogen, quality, and, extraction, efficiency, in, order, to, run, a, profitable, operation, the, price, of, crude, oil, would, need, to, remain, above, these, levels, the, analysis, also, discussed, the, expectation, that, processing, costs, would, drop, after, the, establishment, of, the, complex, the, hypothetical, unit, would, see, a, cost, reduction, of, 35, 70, after, producing, its, first, 500, million, barrels, 79, million, cubic, metres, assuming, an, increase, in, output, of, 25, thousand, barrels, per, day, 4, 0, 10, 3, m, 3, d, during, each, year, after, the, start, of, commercial, production, rand, predicted, the, costs, would, decline, to, 35, 48, per, barrel, 220, 300, m, 3, within, 12, years, after, achieving, the, milestone, of, 1, billion, barrels, 160, million, cubic, metres, its, costs, would, decline, further, to, 30, 40, per, barrel, 190, 250, m, 3, in, 2010, the, international, energy, agency, estimated, based, on, the, various, pilot, projects, that, investment, and, operating, costs, would, be, similar, to, those, of, canadian, oil, sands, that, means, would, be, economic, at, prices, above, 60, per, barrel, at, current, costs, this, figure, does, not, account, carbon, pricing, which, will, add, additional, cost, according, to, the, new, policies, scenario, introduced, in, its, world, energy, outlook, 2010, a, price, of, 50, per, tonne, of, emitted, co, 2, adds, additional, 7, 50, cost, per, barrel, of, shale, oil, as, of, november, 2021, the, price, of, tonne, of, co, 2, exceeded, 60, a, 1972, publication, in, the, journal, p, trole, informations, issn, 0755, 561x, compared, shale, based, oil, production, unfavorably, with, coal, liquefaction, the, article, portrayed, coal, liquefaction, as, less, expensive, generating, more, oil, and, creating, fewer, environmental, impacts, than, extraction, from, oil, shale, it, cited, a, conversion, ratio, of, 650, liters, 170, u, s, gal, 140, imp, gal, of, oil, per, one, ton, of, coal, as, against, 150, liters, 40, u, s, gal, 33, imp, gal, of, shale, oil, per, one, ton, of, oil, shale, a, critical, measure, of, the, viability, of, oil, shale, as, an, energy, source, lies, in, the, ratio, of, the, energy, produced, by, the, shale, to, the, energy, used, in, its, mining, and, processing, a, ratio, known, as, energy, return, on, investment, eroi, a, 1984, study, estimated, the, eroi, of, the, various, known, oil, shale, deposits, as, varying, between, 0, 7, 13, 3, although, known, oil, shale, extraction, development, projects, assert, an, eroi, between, 3, and, 10, according, to, the, world, energy, outlook, 2010, the, eroi, of, ex, situ, processing, is, typically, 4, to, 5, while, of, in, situ, processing, it, may, be, even, as, low, as, 2, however, according, to, the, iea, most, of, used, energy, can, be, provided, by, burning, the, spent, shale, or, oil, shale, gas, to, increase, efficiency, when, retorting, oil, shale, researchers, have, proposed, and, tested, several, co, pyrolysis, processes, mining, oil, shale, involves, numerous, environmental, impacts, more, pronounced, in, surface, mining, than, in, underground, mining, these, include, acid, drainage, induced, by, the, sudden, rapid, exposure, and, subsequent, oxidation, of, formerly, buried, materials, the, introduction, of, metals, including, mercury, into, surface, water, and, groundwater, increased, erosion, sulfur, gas, emissions, and, air, pollution, caused, by, the, production, of, particulates, during, processing, transport, and, support, activities, oil, shale, extraction, can, damage, the, biological, and, recreational, value, of, land, and, the, ecosystem, in, the, mining, area, combustion, and, thermal, processing, generate, waste, material, in, addition, the, atmospheric, emissions, from, oil, shale, processing, and, combustion, include, carbon, dioxide, a, greenhouse, gas, environmentalists, oppose, production, and, usage, of, oil, shale, as, it, creates, even, more, greenhouse, gases, than, conventional, fossil, fuels, experimental, in, situ, conversion, processes, and, carbon, capture, and, storage, technologies, may, reduce, some, of, these, concerns, in, the, future, but, at, the, same, time, they, may, cause, other, problems, including, groundwater, pollution, among, the, water, contaminants, commonly, associated, with, oil, shale, processing, are, oxygen, and, nitrogen, heterocyclic, hydrocarbons, commonly, detected, examples, include, quinoline, derivatives, pyridine, and, various, alkyl, homologues, of, pyridine, such, as, picoline, and, lutidine, water, concerns, are, sensitive, issues, in, arid, regions, such, as, the, western, u, s, and, israel, s, negev, desert, where, plans, exist, to, expand, oil, shale, extraction, despite, a, water, shortage, depending, on, technology, above, ground, retorting, uses, between, one, and, five, barrels, of, water, per, barrel, of, produced, shale, oil, a, 2008, programmatic, environmental, impact, statement, issued, by, the, u, s, bureau, of, land, management,
