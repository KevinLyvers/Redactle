spiral, galaxies, form, a, class, of, galaxy, originally, described, by, edwin, hubble, in, his, 1936, work, the, realm, of, the, nebulae, and, as, such, form, part, of, the, hubble, sequence, most, spiral, galaxies, consist, of, a, flat, rotating, disk, containing, stars, gas, and, dust, and, a, central, concentration, of, stars, known, as, the, bulge, these, are, often, surrounded, by, a, much, fainter, halo, of, stars, many, of, which, reside, in, globular, clusters, spiral, galaxies, are, named, by, their, spiral, structures, that, extend, from, the, center, into, the, galactic, disc, the, spiral, arms, are, sites, of, ongoing, star, formation, and, are, brighter, than, the, surrounding, disc, because, of, the, young, hot, ob, stars, that, inhabit, them, roughly, two, thirds, of, all, spirals, are, observed, to, have, an, additional, component, in, the, form, of, a, bar, like, structure, extending, from, the, central, bulge, at, the, ends, of, which, the, spiral, arms, begin, the, proportion, of, barred, spirals, relative, to, barless, spirals, has, likely, changed, over, the, history, of, the, universe, with, only, about, 10, containing, bars, about, 8, billion, years, ago, to, roughly, a, quarter, 2, 5, billion, years, ago, until, present, where, over, two, thirds, of, the, galaxies, in, the, visible, universe, hubble, volume, have, bars, the, milky, way, is, a, barred, spiral, although, the, bar, itself, is, difficult, to, observe, from, earth, s, current, position, within, the, galactic, disc, the, most, convincing, evidence, for, the, stars, forming, a, bar, in, the, galactic, center, comes, from, several, recent, surveys, including, the, spitzer, space, telescope, together, with, irregular, galaxies, spiral, galaxies, make, up, approximately, 60, of, galaxies, in, today, s, universe, they, are, mostly, found, in, low, density, regions, and, are, rare, in, the, centers, of, galaxy, clusters, spiral, galaxies, may, consist, of, several, distinct, components, the, relative, importance, in, terms, of, mass, brightness, and, size, of, the, different, components, varies, from, galaxy, to, galaxy, spiral, arms, are, regions, of, stars, that, extend, from, the, center, of, barred, and, unbarred, spiral, galaxies, these, long, thin, regions, resemble, a, spiral, and, thus, give, spiral, galaxies, their, name, naturally, different, classifications, of, spiral, galaxies, have, distinct, arm, structures, sc, and, sbc, galaxies, for, instance, have, very, loose, arms, whereas, sa, and, sba, galaxies, have, tightly, wrapped, arms, with, reference, to, the, hubble, sequence, either, way, spiral, arms, contain, many, young, blue, stars, due, to, the, high, mass, density, and, the, high, rate, of, star, formation, which, make, the, arms, so, bright, a, bulge, is, a, large, tightly, packed, group, of, stars, the, term, refers, to, the, central, group, of, stars, found, in, most, spiral, galaxies, often, defined, as, the, excess, of, stellar, light, above, the, inward, extrapolation, of, the, outer, exponential, disk, light, using, the, hubble, classification, the, bulge, of, sa, galaxies, is, usually, composed, of, population, ii, stars, which, are, old, red, stars, with, low, metal, content, further, the, bulge, of, sa, and, sba, galaxies, tends, to, be, large, in, contrast, the, bulges, of, sc, and, sbc, galaxies, are, much, smaller, and, are, composed, of, young, blue, population, i, stars, some, bulges, have, similar, properties, to, those, of, elliptical, galaxies, scaled, down, to, lower, mass, and, luminosity, others, simply, appear, as, higher, density, centers, of, disks, with, properties, similar, to, disk, galaxies, many, bulges, are, thought, to, host, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, their, centers, in, our, own, galaxy, for, instance, the, object, called, sagittarius, a, is, a, supermassive, black, hole, there, are, many, lines, of, evidence, for, the, existence, of, black, holes, in, spiral, galaxy, centers, including, the, presence, of, active, nuclei, in, some, spiral, galaxies, and, dynamical, measurements, that, find, large, compact, central, masses, in, galaxies, such, as, messier, 106, bar, shaped, elongations, of, stars, are, observed, in, roughly, two, thirds, of, all, spiral, galaxies, their, presence, may, be, either, strong, or, weak, in, edge, on, spiral, and, lenticular, galaxies, the, presence, of, the, bar, can, sometimes, be, discerned, by, the, out, of, plane, x, shaped, or, peanut, shell, shaped, structures, which, typically, have, a, maximum, visibility, at, half, the, length, of, the, in, plane, bar, the, bulk, of, the, stars, in, a, spiral, galaxy, are, located, either, close, to, a, single, plane, the, galactic, plane, in, more, or, less, conventional, circular, orbits, around, the, center, of, the, galaxy, the, galactic, center, or, in, a, spheroidal, galactic, bulge, around, the, galactic, core, however, some, stars, inhabit, a, spheroidal, halo, or, galactic, spheroid, a, type, of, galactic, halo, the, orbital, behaviour, of, these, stars, is, disputed, but, they, may, exhibit, retrograde, and, or, highly, inclined, orbits, or, not, move, in, regular, orbits, at, all, halo, stars, may, be, acquired, from, small, galaxies, which, fall, into, and, merge, with, the, spiral, galaxy, for, example, the, sagittarius, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxy, is, in, the, process, of, merging, with, the, milky, way, and, observations, show, that, some, stars, in, the, halo, of, the, milky, way, have, been, acquired, from, it, unlike, the, galactic, disc, the, halo, seems, to, be, free, of, dust, and, in, further, contrast, stars, in, the, galactic, halo, are, of, population, ii, much, older, and, with, much, lower, metallicity, than, their, population, i, cousins, in, the, galactic, disc, but, similar, to, those, in, the, galactic, bulge, the, galactic, halo, also, contains, many, globular, clusters, the, motion, of, halo, stars, does, bring, them, through, the, disc, on, occasion, and, a, number, of, small, red, dwarfs, close, to, the, sun, are, thought, to, belong, to, the, galactic, halo, for, example, kapteyn, s, star, and, groombridge, 1830, due, to, their, irregular, movement, around, the, center, of, the, galaxy, these, stars, often, display, unusually, high, proper, motion, bri, 1335, 0417, is, the, oldest, and, most, distant, known, spiral, galaxy, as, of, 2024, the, galaxy, has, a, redshift, of, 4, 4, meaning, its, light, took, 12, 4, billion, years, to, reach, earth, the, oldest, grand, design, spiral, galaxy, on, file, is, bx442, at, eleven, billion, years, old, it, is, more, than, two, billion, years, older, than, any, previous, discovery, researchers, believe, the, galaxy, s, shape, is, caused, by, the, gravitational, influence, of, a, companion, dwarf, galaxy, computer, models, based, on, that, assumption, indicate, that, bx442, s, spiral, structure, will, last, about, 100, million, years, a1689b11, is, an, extremely, old, spiral, galaxy, located, in, the, abell, 1689, galaxy, cluster, in, the, virgo, constellation, a1689b11, is, 11, billion, light, years, from, the, earth, forming, 2, 6, billion, years, after, the, big, bang, in, june, 2019, citizen, scientists, through, galaxy, zoo, reported, that, the, usual, hubble, classification, particularly, concerning, spiral, galaxies, may, not, be, supported, and, may, need, updating, the, pioneer, of, studies, of, the, rotation, of, the, galaxy, and, the, formation, of, the, spiral, arms, was, bertil, lindblad, in, 1925, he, realized, that, the, idea, of, stars, arranged, permanently, in, a, spiral, shape, was, untenable, since, the, angular, speed, of, rotation, of, the, galactic, disk, varies, with, distance, from, the, centre, of, the, galaxy, via, a, standard, solar, system, type, of, gravitational, model, a, radial, arm, like, a, spoke, would, quickly, become, curved, as, the, galaxy, rotates, the, arm, would, after, a, few, galactic, rotations, become, increasingly, curved, and, wind, around, the, galaxy, ever, tighter, this, is, called, the, winding, problem, measurements, in, the, late, 1960s, showed, that, the, orbital, velocity, of, stars, in, spiral, galaxies, with, respect, to, their, distance, from, the, galactic, center, is, indeed, higher, than, expected, from, newtonian, dynamics, but, still, cannot, explain, the, stability, of, the, spiral, structure, since, the, 1970s, there, have, been, two, leading, hypotheses, or, models, for, the, spiral, structures, of, galaxies, these, different, hypotheses, are, not, mutually, exclusive, as, they, may, explain, different, types, of, spiral, arms, bertil, lindblad, proposed, that, the, arms, represent, regions, of, enhanced, density, density, waves, that, rotate, more, slowly, than, the, galaxy, s, stars, and, gas, as, gas, enters, a, density, wave, it, gets, squeezed, and, makes, new, stars, some, of, which, are, short, lived, blue, stars, that, light, the, arms, the, first, acceptable, theory, for, the, spiral, structure, was, devised, by, c, c, lin, and, frank, shu, in, 1964, attempting, to, explain, the, large, scale, structure, of, spirals, in, terms, of, a, small, amplitude, wave, propagating, with, fixed, angular, velocity, that, revolves, around, the, galaxy, at, a, speed, different, from, that, of, the, galaxy, s, gas, and, stars, they, suggested, that, the, spiral, arms, were, manifestations, of, spiral, density, waves, they, assumed, that, the, stars, travel, in, slightly, elliptical, orbits, and, that, the, orientations, of, their, orbits, is, correlated, i, e, the, ellipses, vary, in, their, orientation, one, to, another, in, a, smooth, way, with, increasing, distance, from, the, galactic, center, this, is, illustrated, in, the, diagram, to, the, right, it, is, clear, that, the, elliptical, orbits, come, close, together, in, certain, areas, to, give, the, effect, of, arms, stars, therefore, do, not, remain, forever, in, the, position, that, we, now, see, them, in, but, pass, through, the, arms, as, they, travel, in, their, orbits, the, following, hypotheses, exist, for, star, formation, caused, by, density, waves, spiral, arms, appear, visually, brighter, because, they, contain, both, young, stars, and, more, massive, and, luminous, stars, than, the, rest, of, the, galaxy, as, massive, stars, evolve, far, more, quickly, their, demise, tends, to, leave, a, darker, background, of, fainter, stars, immediately, behind, the, density, waves, this, make, the, density, waves, much, more, prominent, spiral, arms, simply, appear, to, pass, through, the, older, established, stars, as, they, travel, in, their, galactic, orbits, so, they, also, do, not, necessarily, follow, the, arms, as, stars, move, through, an, arm, the, space, velocity, of, each, stellar, system, is, modified, by, the, gravitational, force, of, the, local, higher, density, also, the, newly, created, stars, do, not, remain, forever, fixed, in, the, position, within, the, spiral, arms, where, the, average, space, velocity, returns, to, normal, after, the, stars, depart, on, the, other, side, of, the, arm, charles, francis, and, erik, anderson, showed, from, observations, of, motions, of, over, 20, 000, local, stars, within, 300, parsecs, that, stars, do, move, along, spiral, arms, and, described, how, mutual, gravity, between, stars, causes, orbits, to, align, on, logarithmic, spirals, when, the, theory, is, applied, to, gas, collisions, between, gas, clouds, generate, the, molecular, clouds, in, which, new, stars, form, and, evolution, towards, grand, design, bisymmetric, spirals, is, explained, the, stars, in, spirals, are, distributed, in, thin, disks, radial, with, intensity, profiles, such, that, with, h, displaystyle, h, being, the, disk, scale, length, i, 0, displaystyle, i, 0, is, the, central, value, it, is, useful, to, define, r, o, p, t, 3, 2, h, displaystyle, r, opt, 3, 2h, as, the, size, of, the, stellar, disk, whose, luminosity, is, l, t, o, t, 2, i, 0, h, 2, displaystyle, l, tot, 2, pi, i, 0, h, 2, the, spiral, galaxies, light, profiles, in, terms, of, the, coordinate, r, h, displaystyle, r, h, do, not, depend, on, galaxy, luminosity, before, it, was, understood, that, spiral, galaxies, existed, outside, of, our, milky, way, galaxy, they, were, often, referred, to, as, spiral, nebulae, due, to, lord, rosse, whose, telescope, leviathan, was, the, first, to, reveal, the, spiral, structure, of, galaxies, in, 1845, he, discovered, the, spiral, structure, of, m51, a, galaxy, nicknamed, later, as, the, whirlpool, galaxy, and, his, drawings, of, it, closely, resemble, modern, photographs, in, 1846, and, in, 1849, lord, rosse, identified, similar, pattern, in, messier, 99, and, messier, 33, respectively, in, 1850, he, made, the, first, drawing, of, andromeda, galaxy, s, spiral, structure, in, 1852, stephen, alexander, supposed, that, milky, way, is, also, a, spiral, nebula, the, question, of, whether, such, objects, were, separate, galaxies, independent, of, the, milky, way, or, a, type, of, nebula, existing, within, our, own, galaxy, was, the, subject, of, the, great, debate, of, 1920, between, heber, curtis, of, lick, observatory, and, harlow, shapley, of, mount, wilson, observatory, beginning, in, 1923, edwin, hubble, observed, cepheid, variables, in, several, spiral, nebulae, including, the, so, called, andromeda, nebula, proving, that, they, are, in, fact, entire, galaxies, outside, our, own, the, term, spiral, nebula, has, since, fallen, out, of, use, the, milky, way, was, once, considered, an, ordinary, spiral, galaxy, astronomers, first, began, to, suspect, that, the, milky, way, is, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, in, the, 1960s, their, suspicions, were, confirmed, by, spitzer, space, telescope, observations, in, 2005, which, showed, that, the, milky, way, s, central, bar, is, larger, than, what, was, previously, suspected
