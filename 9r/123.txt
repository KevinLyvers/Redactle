the, local, group, is, the, galaxy, group, that, includes, the, milky, way, where, earth, is, located, it, has, a, total, diameter, of, roughly, 3, megaparsecs, 10, million, light, years, 9, 10, 19, kilometres, and, a, total, mass, of, the, order, of, 2, 10, 12, solar, masses, 4, 10, 42, kg, it, consists, of, two, collections, of, galaxies, in, a, dumbbell, shape, the, milky, way, and, its, satellites, form, one, lobe, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, its, satellites, constitute, the, other, the, two, collections, are, separated, by, about, 800, kiloparsecs, 3, 10, 6, ly, 2, 10, 19, km, and, are, moving, toward, one, another, with, a, velocity, of, 123, km, s, the, group, itself, is, a, part, of, the, larger, virgo, supercluster, which, may, be, a, part, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, the, exact, number, of, galaxies, in, the, local, group, is, unknown, as, some, are, occluded, by, the, milky, way, however, at, least, 80, members, are, known, most, of, which, are, dwarf, galaxies, the, two, largest, members, the, andromeda, and, the, milky, way, galaxies, are, both, spiral, galaxies, with, masses, of, about, 10, 12, solar, masses, each, each, has, its, own, system, of, satellite, galaxies, the, triangulum, galaxy, m33, is, the, third, largest, member, of, the, local, group, with, a, mass, of, approximately, 5, 10, 10, m, 1, 10, 41, kg, and, is, the, third, spiral, galaxy, it, is, unclear, whether, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, a, companion, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, two, galaxies, are, 750, 000, light, years, apart, and, experienced, a, close, passage, 2, 4, billion, years, ago, which, triggered, star, formation, across, andromeda, s, disk, the, pisces, dwarf, galaxy, is, equidistant, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, triangulum, galaxy, so, it, may, be, a, satellite, of, either, the, other, members, of, the, group, are, likely, gravitationally, secluded, from, these, large, subgroups, ic, 10, ic, 1613, phoenix, dwarf, galaxy, leo, a, tucana, dwarf, galaxy, cetus, dwarf, galaxy, pegasus, dwarf, irregular, galaxy, wolf, lundmark, melotte, aquarius, dwarf, galaxy, and, sagittarius, dwarf, irregular, galaxy, the, membership, of, ngc, 3109, with, its, companions, sextans, a, and, the, antlia, dwarf, galaxy, as, well, as, sextans, b, leo, p, antlia, b, and, possibly, leo, a, is, uncertain, due, to, extreme, distances, from, the, center, of, the, local, group, the, antlia, sextans, group, is, unlikely, to, be, gravitationally, bound, to, the, local, group, due, to, probably, lying, outside, the, local, group, s, zero, velocity, surface, which, would, make, it, a, true, galaxy, group, of, its, own, rather, than, a, subgroup, within, the, local, group, this, possible, independence, may, however, disappear, as, the, milky, way, continues, coalescing, with, andromeda, due, to, the, increased, mass, and, density, thereof, plausibly, widening, the, radius, of, the, zero, velocity, surface, of, the, local, group, the, term, the, local, group, was, introduced, by, edwin, hubble, in, chapter, vi, of, his, 1936, book, the, realm, of, the, nebulae, there, he, described, it, as, a, typical, small, group, of, nebulae, which, is, isolated, in, the, general, field, and, delineated, by, decreasing, luminosity, its, members, to, be, m31, milky, way, m33, large, magellanic, cloud, small, magellanic, cloud, m32, ngc, 205, ngc, 6822, ngc, 185, ic, 1613, and, ngc, 147, he, also, identified, ic, 10, as, a, possible, part, of, the, local, group, mass, 7, 10, 9, m, the, galaxies, of, the, local, group, are, likely, to, merge, together, under, their, own, mutual, gravitational, attractions, over, a, timescale, of, tens, of, billions, of, years, into, a, single, elliptical, galaxy, with, the, coalescence, of, messier, 31, and, the, milky, way, being, the, predominant, event, in, this, process, it, is, uncertain, whether, these, are, companion, galaxies, of, the, andromeda, galaxy
