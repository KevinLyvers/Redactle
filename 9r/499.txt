in, chemistry, an, alcohol, from, the, arabic, word, al, ku, l, is, a, type, of, organic, compound, that, carries, at, least, one, hydroxyl, oh, functional, group, bound, to, a, saturated, carbon, atom, alcohols, range, from, the, simple, like, methanol, and, ethanol, to, complex, like, sugars, and, cholesterol, the, presence, of, an, oh, group, strongly, modifies, the, properties, of, hydrocarbons, conferring, hydrophilic, water, loving, properties, the, oh, group, provides, a, site, at, which, many, reactions, can, occur, the, flammable, nature, of, the, exhalations, of, wine, was, already, known, to, ancient, natural, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, theophrastus, c, 371, 287, bce, and, pliny, the, elder, 23, 24, 79, ce, however, this, did, not, immediately, lead, to, the, isolation, of, alcohol, even, despite, the, development, of, more, advanced, distillation, techniques, in, second, and, third, century, roman, egypt, an, important, recognition, first, found, in, one, of, the, writings, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, ninth, century, ce, was, that, by, adding, salt, to, boiling, wine, which, increases, the, wine, s, relative, volatility, the, flammability, of, the, resulting, vapors, may, be, enhanced, the, distillation, of, wine, is, attested, in, arabic, works, attributed, to, al, kind, c, 801, 873, ce, and, to, al, f, r, b, c, 872, 950, and, in, the, 28th, book, of, al, zahr, w, s, latin, abulcasis, 936, 1013, kit, b, al, ta, r, f, later, translated, into, latin, as, liber, servatoris, in, the, twelfth, century, recipes, for, the, production, of, aqua, ardens, burning, water, i, e, alcohol, by, distilling, wine, with, salt, started, to, appear, in, a, number, of, latin, works, and, by, the, end, of, the, thirteenth, century, it, had, become, a, widely, known, substance, among, western, european, chemists, the, works, of, taddeo, alderotti, 1223, 1296, describe, a, method, for, concentrating, alcohol, involving, repeated, fractional, distillation, through, a, water, cooled, still, by, which, an, alcohol, purity, of, 90, could, be, obtained, the, medicinal, properties, of, ethanol, were, studied, by, arnald, of, villanova, 1240, 1311, ce, and, john, of, rupescissa, c, 1310, 1366, the, latter, of, whom, regarded, it, as, a, life, preserving, substance, able, to, prevent, all, diseases, the, aqua, vitae, or, water, of, life, also, called, by, john, the, quintessence, of, wine, the, word, alcohol, derives, from, the, arabic, kohl, arabic, romanized, al, ku, l, a, powder, used, as, an, eyeliner, the, first, part, of, the, word, al, is, the, arabic, definite, article, equivalent, to, the, in, english, the, second, part, of, the, word, ku, l, has, several, antecedents, in, semitic, languages, ultimately, deriving, from, the, akkadian, gu, lum, meaning, stibnite, or, antimony, like, its, antecedents, in, arabic, and, older, languages, the, term, alcohol, was, originally, used, for, the, very, fine, powder, produced, by, the, sublimation, of, the, natural, mineral, stibnite, to, form, antimony, trisulfide, sb, 2, s, 3, it, was, considered, to, be, the, essence, or, spirit, of, this, mineral, it, was, used, as, an, antiseptic, eyeliner, and, cosmetic, later, the, meaning, of, alcohol, was, extended, to, distilled, substances, in, general, and, then, narrowed, again, to, ethanol, when, spirits, was, a, synonym, for, hard, liquor, paracelsus, and, libavius, both, used, the, term, alcohol, to, denote, a, fine, powder, the, latter, speaking, of, an, alcohol, derived, from, antimony, at, the, same, time, paracelsus, uses, the, word, for, a, volatile, liquid, alcool, or, alcool, vini, occurs, often, in, his, writings, bartholomew, traheron, in, his, 1543, translation, of, john, of, vigo, introduces, the, word, as, a, term, used, by, barbarous, authors, for, fine, powder, vigo, wrote, the, barbarous, auctours, use, alcohol, or, as, i, fynde, it, sometymes, wryten, alcofoll, for, moost, fine, poudre, the, 1657, lexicon, chymicum, by, william, johnson, glosses, the, word, as, antimonium, sive, stibium, by, extension, the, word, came, to, refer, to, any, fluid, obtained, by, distillation, including, alcohol, of, wine, the, distilled, essence, of, wine, libavius, in, alchymia, 1594, refers, to, vini, alcohol, vel, vinum, alcalisatum, johnson, 1657, glosses, alcohol, vini, as, quando, omnis, superfluitas, vini, a, vino, separatur, ita, ut, accensum, ardeat, donec, totum, consumatur, nihilque, f, cum, aut, phlegmatis, in, fundo, remaneat, the, word, s, meaning, became, restricted, to, spirit, of, wine, the, chemical, known, today, as, ethanol, in, the, 18th, century, and, was, extended, to, the, class, of, substances, so, called, as, alcohols, in, modern, chemistry, after, 1850, the, term, ethanol, was, invented, in, 1892, blending, ethane, with, the, ol, ending, of, alcohol, which, was, generalized, as, a, libfix, the, term, alcohol, originally, referred, to, the, primary, alcohol, ethanol, ethyl, alcohol, which, is, used, as, a, drug, and, is, the, main, alcohol, present, in, alcoholic, drinks, the, suffix, ol, appears, in, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, chemical, name, of, all, substances, where, the, hydroxyl, group, is, the, functional, group, with, the, highest, priority, when, a, higher, priority, group, is, present, in, the, compound, the, prefix, hydroxy, is, used, in, its, iupac, name, the, suffix, ol, in, non, iupac, names, such, as, paracetamol, or, cholesterol, also, typically, indicates, that, the, substance, is, an, alcohol, however, some, compounds, that, contain, hydroxyl, functional, groups, have, trivial, names, that, do, not, include, the, suffix, ol, or, the, prefix, hydroxy, e, g, the, sugars, glucose, and, sucrose, iupac, nomenclature, is, used, in, scientific, publications, and, in, writings, where, precise, identification, of, the, substance, is, important, in, naming, simple, alcohols, the, name, of, the, alkane, chain, loses, the, terminal, e, and, adds, the, suffix, ol, e, g, as, in, ethanol, from, the, alkane, chain, name, ethane, when, necessary, the, position, of, the, hydroxyl, group, is, indicated, by, a, number, between, the, alkane, name, and, the, ol, propan, 1, ol, for, ch, 3, ch, 2, ch, 2, oh, propan, 2, ol, for, ch, 3, ch, oh, ch, 3, if, a, higher, priority, group, is, present, such, as, an, aldehyde, ketone, or, carboxylic, acid, then, the, prefix, hydroxy, is, used, e, g, as, in, 1, hydroxy, 2, propanone, ch, 3, c, o, ch, 2, oh, compounds, having, more, than, one, hydroxy, group, are, called, polyols, they, are, named, using, suffixes, diol, triol, etc, following, a, list, of, the, position, numbers, of, the, hydroxyl, groups, as, in, propane, 1, 2, diol, for, ch, 3, ch, oh, ch, 2, oh, propylene, glycol, in, cases, where, the, hydroxy, group, is, bonded, to, an, sp, 2, carbon, on, an, aromatic, ring, the, molecule, is, classified, separately, as, a, phenol, and, is, named, using, the, iupac, rules, for, naming, phenols, phenols, have, distinct, properties, and, are, not, classified, as, alcohols, in, other, less, formal, contexts, an, alcohol, is, often, called, with, the, name, of, the, corresponding, alkyl, group, followed, by, the, word, alcohol, e, g, methyl, alcohol, ethyl, alcohol, propyl, alcohol, may, be, n, propyl, alcohol, or, isopropyl, alcohol, depending, on, whether, the, hydroxyl, group, is, bonded, to, the, end, or, middle, carbon, on, the, straight, propane, chain, as, described, under, systematic, naming, if, another, group, on, the, molecule, takes, priority, the, alcohol, moiety, is, often, indicated, using, the, hydroxy, prefix, in, archaic, nomenclature, alcohols, can, be, named, as, derivatives, of, methanol, using, carbinol, as, the, ending, for, instance, ch, 3, 3, coh, can, be, named, trimethylcarbinol, alcohols, are, then, classified, into, primary, secondary, sec, s, and, tertiary, tert, t, based, upon, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, connected, to, the, carbon, atom, that, bears, the, hydroxyl, functional, group, the, respective, numeric, shorthands, 1, 2, and, 3, are, sometimes, used, in, informal, settings, the, primary, alcohols, have, general, formulas, rch, 2, oh, the, simplest, primary, alcohol, is, methanol, ch, 3, oh, for, which, r, h, and, the, next, is, ethanol, for, which, r, ch, 3, the, methyl, group, secondary, alcohols, are, those, of, the, form, rr, choh, the, simplest, of, which, is, 2, propanol, r, r, ch, 3, for, the, tertiary, alcohols, the, general, form, is, rr, r, coh, the, simplest, example, is, tert, butanol, 2, methylpropan, 2, ol, for, which, each, of, r, r, and, r, is, ch, 3, in, these, shorthands, r, r, and, r, represent, substituents, alkyl, or, other, attached, generally, organic, groups, alcohols, have, a, long, history, of, myriad, uses, for, simple, mono, alcohols, which, is, the, focus, on, this, article, the, following, are, most, important, industrial, alcohols, methanol, is, the, most, common, industrial, alcohol, with, about, 12, million, tons, y, produced, in, 1980, the, combined, capacity, of, the, other, alcohols, is, about, the, same, distributed, roughly, equally, with, respect, to, acute, toxicity, simple, alcohols, have, low, acute, toxicities, doses, of, several, milliliters, are, tolerated, for, pentanols, hexanols, octanols, and, longer, alcohols, ld50, range, from, 2, 5, g, kg, rats, oral, ethanol, is, less, acutely, toxic, all, alcohols, are, mild, skin, irritants, methanol, and, ethylene, glycol, are, more, toxic, than, other, simple, alcohols, their, metabolism, is, affected, by, the, presence, of, ethanol, which, has, a, higher, affinity, for, liver, alcohol, dehydrogenase, in, this, way, methanol, will, be, excreted, intact, in, urine, in, general, the, hydroxyl, group, makes, alcohols, polar, those, groups, can, form, hydrogen, bonds, to, one, another, and, to, most, other, compounds, owing, to, the, presence, of, the, polar, oh, alcohols, are, more, water, soluble, than, simple, hydrocarbons, methanol, ethanol, and, propanol, are, miscible, in, water, 1, butanol, with, a, four, carbon, chain, is, moderately, soluble, because, of, hydrogen, bonding, alcohols, tend, to, have, higher, boiling, points, than, comparable, hydrocarbons, and, ethers, the, boiling, point, of, the, alcohol, ethanol, is, 78, 29, c, compared, to, 69, c, for, the, hydrocarbon, hexane, and, 34, 6, c, for, diethyl, ether, alcohols, occur, widely, in, nature, as, derivatives, of, glucose, such, as, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, and, in, phenols, and, their, derivatives, such, as, lignin, starting, from, biomass, 180, billion, tons, y, of, complex, carbohydrates, sugar, polymers, are, produced, commercially, as, of, 2014, many, other, alcohols, are, pervasive, in, organisms, as, manifested, in, other, sugars, such, as, fructose, and, sucrose, in, polyols, such, as, glycerol, and, in, some, amino, acids, such, as, serine, simple, alcohols, like, methanol, ethanol, and, propanol, occur, in, modest, quantities, in, nature, and, are, industrially, synthesized, in, large, quantities, for, use, as, chemical, precursors, fuels, and, solvents, many, alcohols, are, produced, by, hydroxylation, i, e, the, installation, of, a, hydroxy, group, using, oxygen, or, a, related, oxidant, hydroxylation, is, the, means, by, which, the, body, processes, many, poisons, converting, lipophilic, compounds, into, hydrophilic, derivatives, that, are, more, readily, excreted, enzymes, called, hydroxylases, and, oxidases, facilitate, these, conversions, many, industrial, alcohols, such, as, cyclohexanol, for, the, production, of, nylon, are, produced, by, hydroxylation, in, the, ziegler, process, linear, alcohols, are, produced, from, ethylene, and, triethylaluminium, followed, by, oxidation, and, hydrolysis, an, idealized, synthesis, of, 1, octanol, is, shown, the, process, generates, a, range, of, alcohols, that, are, separated, by, distillation, many, higher, alcohols, are, produced, by, hydroformylation, of, alkenes, followed, by, hydrogenation, when, applied, to, a, terminal, alkene, as, is, common, one, typically, obtains, a, linear, alcohol, such, processes, give, fatty, alcohols, which, are, useful, for, detergents, some, low, molecular, weight, alcohols, of, industrial, importance, are, produced, by, the, addition, of, water, to, alkenes, ethanol, isopropanol, 2, butanol, and, tert, butanol, are, produced, by, this, general, method, two, implementations, are, employed, the, direct, and, indirect, methods, the, direct, method, avoids, the, formation, of, stable, intermediates, typically, using, acid, catalysts, in, the, indirect, method, the, alkene, is, converted, to, the, sulfate, ester, which, is, subsequently, hydrolyzed, the, direct, hydration, uses, ethylene, ethylene, hydration, or, other, alkenes, from, cracking, of, fractions, of, distilled, crude, oil, hydration, is, also, used, industrially, to, produce, the, diol, ethylene, glycol, from, ethylene, oxide, ethanol, is, obtained, by, fermentation, of, glucose, which, is, often, obtained, from, starch, in, the, presence, of, yeast, carbon, dioxide, is, cogenerated, like, ethanol, butanol, can, be, produced, by, fermentation, processes, saccharomyces, yeast, are, known, to, produce, these, higher, alcohols, at, temperatures, above, 75, f, 24, c, the, bacterium, clostridium, acetobutylicum, can, feed, on, cellulose, also, an, alcohol, to, produce, butanol, on, an, industrial, scale, primary, alkyl, halides, react, with, aqueous, naoh, or, koh, to, give, alcohols, in, nucleophilic, aliphatic, substitution, secondary, and, especially, tertiary, alkyl, halides, will, give, the, elimination, alkene, product, instead, grignard, reagents, react, with, carbonyl, groups, to, give, secondary, and, tertiary, alcohols, related, reactions, are, the, barbier, reaction, and, the, nozaki, hiyama, reaction, aldehydes, or, ketones, are, reduced, with, sodium, borohydride, or, lithium, aluminium, hydride, after, an, acidic, workup, another, reduction, using, aluminium, isopropoxide, is, the, meerwein, ponndorf, verley, reduction, noyori, asymmetric, hydrogenation, is, the, asymmetric, reduction, of, keto, esters, alkenes, engage, in, an, acid, catalyzed, hydration, reaction, using, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, as, a, catalyst, that, gives, usually, secondary, or, tertiary, alcohols, formation, of, a, secondary, alcohol, via, alkene, reduction, and, hydration, is, shown, the, hydroboration, oxidation, and, oxymercuration, reduction, of, alkenes, are, more, reliable, in, organic, synthesis, alkenes, react, with, n, bromosuccinimide, and, water, in, halohydrin, formation, reaction, amines, can, be, converted, to, diazonium, salts, which, are, then, hydrolyzed, with, aqueous, p, k, a, values, of, around, 16, 19, alcohols, are, in, general, slightly, weaker, acids, than, water, with, strong, bases, such, as, sodium, hydride, or, sodium, they, form, salts, called, alkoxides, with, the, general, formula, ro, m, where, r, is, an, alkyl, and, m, is, a, metal, the, acidity, of, alcohols, is, strongly, affected, by, solvation, in, the, gas, phase, alcohols, are, more, acidic, than, in, water, in, dmso, alcohols, and, water, have, a, p, k, a, of, around, 29, 32, as, a, consequence, alkoxides, and, hydroxide, are, powerful, bases, and, nucleophiles, e, g, for, the, williamson, ether, synthesis, in, this, solvent, in, particular, ro, or, ho, in, dmso, can, be, used, to, generate, significant, equilibrium, concentrations, of, acetylide, ions, through, the, deprotonation, of, alkynes, see, favorskii, reaction, tertiary, alcohols, react, with, hydrochloric, acid, to, produce, tertiary, alkyl, chloride, primary, and, secondary, alcohols, are, converted, to, the, corresponding, chlorides, using, thionyl, chloride, and, various, phosphorus, chloride, reagents, primary, and, secondary, alcohols, likewise, convert, to, alkyl, bromides, using, phosphorus, tribromide, for, example, in, the, barton, mccombie, deoxygenation, an, alcohol, is, deoxygenated, to, an, alkane, with, tributyltin, hydride, or, a, trimethylborane, water, complex, in, a, radical, substitution, reaction, meanwhile, the, oxygen, atom, has, lone, pairs, of, nonbonded, electrons, that, render, it, weakly, basic, in, the, presence, of, strong, acids, such, as, sulfuric, acid, for, example, with, methanol, upon, treatment, with, strong, acids, alcohols, undergo, the, e1, elimination, reaction, to, produce, alkenes, the, reaction, in, general, obeys, zaitsev, s, rule, which, states, that, the, most, stable, usually, the, most, substituted, alkene, is, formed, tertiary, alcohols, are, eliminated, easily, at, just, above, room, temperature, but, primary, alcohols, require, a, higher, temperature, this, is, a, diagram, of, acid, catalyzed, dehydration, of, ethanol, to, produce, ethylene, a, more, controlled, elimination, reaction, requires, the, formation, of, the, xanthate, ester, tertiary, alcohols, react, with, strong, acids, to, generate, carbocations, the, reaction, is, related, to, their, dehydration, e, g, isobutylene, from, tert, butyl, alcohol, a, special, kind, of, dehydration, reaction, involves, triphenylmethanol, and, especially, its, amine, substituted, derivatives, when, treated, with, acid, these, alcohols, lose, water, to, give, stable, carbocations, which, are, commercial, dyes, alcohol, and, carboxylic, acids, react, in, the, so, called, fischer, esterification, the, reaction, usually, requires, a, catalyst, such, as, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, other, types, of, ester, are, prepared, in, a, similar, manner, for, example, tosyl, tosylate, esters, are, made, by, reaction, of, the, alcohol, with, 4, toluenesulfonyl, chloride, in, pyridine, primary, alcohols, r, ch, 2, oh, can, be, oxidized, either, to, aldehydes, r, cho, or, to, carboxylic, acids, r, co, 2, h, the, oxidation, of, secondary, alcohols, r, 1, r, 2, ch, oh, normally, terminates, at, the, ketone, r, 1, r, 2, c, o, stage, tertiary, alcohols, r, 1, r, 2, r, 3, c, oh, are, resistant, to, oxidation, the, direct, oxidation, of, primary, alcohols, to, carboxylic, acids, normally, proceeds, via, the, corresponding, aldehyde, which, is, transformed, via, an, aldehyde, hydrate, r, ch, oh, 2, by, reaction, with, water, before, it, can, be, further, oxidized, to, the, carboxylic, acid, reagents, useful, for, the, transformation, of, primary, alcohols, to, aldehydes, are, normally, also, suitable, for, the, oxidation, of, secondary, alcohols, to, ketones, these, include, collins, reagent, and, dess, martin, periodinane, the, direct, oxidation, of, primary, alcohols, to, carboxylic, acids, can, be, carried, out, using, potassium, permanganate, or, the, jones, reagent
