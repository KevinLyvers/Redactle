the, volt, symbol, v, is, the, unit, of, electric, potential, electric, potential, difference, voltage, and, electromotive, force, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, one, volt, is, defined, as, the, electric, potential, between, two, points, of, a, conducting, wire, when, an, electric, current, of, one, ampere, dissipates, one, watt, of, power, between, those, points, it, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, si, base, units, m, kg, s, and, a, as, equivalently, it, is, the, potential, difference, between, two, points, that, will, impart, one, joule, of, energy, per, coulomb, of, charge, that, passes, through, it, it, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, si, base, units, m, kg, s, and, a, as, it, can, also, be, expressed, as, amperes, times, ohms, current, times, resistance, ohm, s, law, webers, per, second, magnetic, flux, per, time, watts, per, ampere, power, per, current, or, joules, per, coulomb, energy, per, charge, which, is, also, equivalent, to, electronvolts, per, elementary, charge, the, volt, is, named, after, alessandro, volta, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, v, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, volt, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, historically, the, conventional, volt, v, 90, defined, in, 1987, by, the, 18th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, and, in, use, from, 1990, to, 2019, was, implemented, using, the, josephson, effect, for, exact, frequency, to, voltage, conversion, combined, with, the, caesium, frequency, standard, though, the, josephson, effect, is, still, used, to, realize, a, volt, the, constant, used, has, changed, slightly, for, the, josephson, constant, k, j, 2, e, h, where, e, is, the, elementary, charge, and, h, is, the, planck, constant, a, conventional, value, k, j, 90, 0, 4835979, ghz, v, was, used, for, the, purpose, of, defining, the, volt, as, a, consequence, of, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, as, of, 2019, the, josephson, constant, has, an, exact, value, of, k, j, 483, 597, 848, 416, 98, ghz, v, which, replaced, the, conventional, value, k, j, 90, this, standard, is, typically, realized, using, a, series, connected, array, of, several, thousand, or, tens, of, thousands, of, junctions, excited, by, microwave, signals, between, 10, and, 80, ghz, depending, on, the, array, design, empirically, several, experiments, have, shown, that, the, method, is, independent, of, device, design, material, measurement, setup, etc, and, no, correction, terms, are, required, in, a, practical, implementation, in, the, water, flow, analogy, sometimes, used, to, explain, electric, circuits, by, comparing, them, with, water, filled, pipes, voltage, difference, in, electric, potential, is, likened, to, difference, in, water, pressure, while, current, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, water, flowing, a, resistor, would, be, a, reduced, diameter, somewhere, in, the, piping, or, something, akin, to, a, radiator, offering, resistance, to, flow, the, relationship, between, voltage, and, current, is, defined, in, ohmic, devices, like, resistors, by, ohm, s, law, ohm, s, law, is, analogous, to, the, hagen, poiseuille, equation, as, both, are, linear, models, relating, flux, and, potential, in, their, respective, systems, the, voltage, produced, by, each, electrochemical, cell, in, a, battery, is, determined, by, the, chemistry, of, that, cell, see, galvanic, cell, cell, voltage, cells, can, be, combined, in, series, for, multiples, of, that, voltage, or, additional, circuitry, added, to, adjust, the, voltage, to, a, different, level, mechanical, generators, can, usually, be, constructed, to, any, voltage, in, a, range, of, feasibility, nominal, voltages, of, familiar, sources, in, 1800, as, the, result, of, a, professional, disagreement, over, the, galvanic, response, advocated, by, luigi, galvani, alessandro, volta, developed, the, so, called, voltaic, pile, a, forerunner, of, the, battery, which, produced, a, steady, electric, current, volta, had, determined, that, the, most, effective, pair, of, dissimilar, metals, to, produce, electricity, was, zinc, and, silver, in, 1861, latimer, clark, and, sir, charles, bright, coined, the, name, volt, for, the, unit, of, resistance, by, 1873, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, had, defined, the, volt, ohm, and, farad, in, 1881, the, international, electrical, congress, now, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, approved, the, volt, as, the, unit, for, electromotive, force, they, made, the, volt, equal, to, 10, 8, cgs, units, of, voltage, the, cgs, system, at, the, time, being, the, customary, system, of, units, in, science, they, chose, such, a, ratio, because, the, cgs, unit, of, voltage, is, inconveniently, small, and, one, volt, in, this, definition, is, approximately, the, emf, of, a, daniell, cell, the, standard, source, of, voltage, in, the, telegraph, systems, of, the, day, at, that, time, the, volt, was, defined, as, the, potential, difference, across, a, conductor, when, a, current, of, one, ampere, dissipates, one, watt, of, power, the, international, volt, was, defined, in, 1893, as, 1, 1, 434, of, the, emf, of, a, clark, cell, this, definition, was, abandoned, in, 1908, in, favor, of, a, definition, based, on, the, international, ohm, and, international, ampere, until, the, entire, set, of, reproducible, units, was, abandoned, in, 1948, a, 2019, revision, of, the, si, including, defining, the, value, of, the, elementary, charge, took, effect, on, 20, may, 2019
