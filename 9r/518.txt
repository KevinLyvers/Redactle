chemical, formula, c, 2, h, 6, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, ethane, is, a, colorless, odorless, gas, like, many, hydrocarbons, ethane, is, isolated, on, an, industrial, scale, from, natural, gas, and, as, a, petrochemical, by, product, of, petroleum, refining, its, chief, use, is, as, feedstock, for, ethylene, production, related, compounds, may, be, formed, by, replacing, a, hydrogen, atom, with, another, functional, group, the, ethane, moiety, is, called, an, ethyl, group, for, example, an, ethyl, group, linked, to, a, hydroxyl, group, yields, ethanol, the, alcohol, in, beverages, ethane, was, first, synthesised, in, 1834, by, michael, faraday, applying, electrolysis, of, a, potassium, acetate, solution, he, mistook, the, hydrocarbon, product, of, this, reaction, for, methane, and, did, not, investigate, it, further, the, process, is, now, called, kolbe, electrolysis, during, the, period, 1847, 1849, in, an, effort, to, vindicate, the, radical, theory, of, organic, chemistry, hermann, kolbe, and, edward, frankland, produced, ethane, by, the, reductions, of, propionitrile, ethyl, cyanide, and, ethyl, iodide, with, potassium, metal, and, as, did, faraday, by, the, electrolysis, of, aqueous, acetates, they, mistook, the, product, of, these, reactions, for, the, methyl, radical, ch, 3, of, which, ethane, c, 2, h, 6, is, a, dimer, this, error, was, corrected, in, 1864, by, carl, schorlemmer, who, showed, that, the, product, of, all, these, reactions, was, in, fact, ethane, ethane, was, discovered, dissolved, in, pennsylvanian, light, crude, oil, by, edmund, ronalds, in, 1864, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, ethane, is, a, colorless, odorless, gas, it, has, a, boiling, point, of, 88, 5, c, 127, 3, f, and, melting, point, of, 182, 8, c, 297, 0, f, solid, ethane, exists, in, several, modifications, on, cooling, under, normal, pressure, the, first, modification, to, appear, is, a, plastic, crystal, crystallizing, in, the, cubic, system, in, this, form, the, positions, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, are, not, fixed, the, molecules, may, rotate, freely, around, the, long, axis, cooling, this, ethane, below, ca, 89, 9, k, 183, 2, c, 297, 8, f, changes, it, to, monoclinic, metastable, ethane, ii, space, group, p, 21, n, ethane, is, only, very, sparingly, soluble, in, water, the, bond, parameters, of, ethane, have, been, measured, to, high, precision, by, microwave, spectroscopy, and, electron, diffraction, r, c, c, 1, 528, 3, r, c, h, 1, 088, 5, and, cch, 111, 6, 5, by, microwave, and, r, c, c, 1, 524, 3, r, c, h, 1, 089, 5, and, cch, 111, 9, 5, by, electron, diffraction, the, numbers, in, parentheses, represents, the, uncertainties, in, the, final, digits, rotating, a, molecular, substructure, about, a, twistable, bond, usually, requires, energy, the, minimum, energy, to, produce, a, 360, bond, rotation, is, called, the, rotational, barrier, ethane, gives, a, classic, simple, example, of, such, a, rotational, barrier, sometimes, called, the, ethane, barrier, among, the, earliest, experimental, evidence, of, this, barrier, see, diagram, at, left, was, obtained, by, modelling, the, entropy, of, ethane, the, three, hydrogens, at, each, end, are, free, to, pinwheel, about, the, central, carbon, carbon, bond, when, provided, with, sufficient, energy, to, overcome, the, barrier, the, physical, origin, of, the, barrier, is, still, not, completely, settled, although, the, overlap, exchange, repulsion, between, the, hydrogen, atoms, on, opposing, ends, of, the, molecule, is, perhaps, the, strongest, candidate, with, the, stabilizing, effect, of, hyperconjugation, on, the, staggered, conformation, contributing, to, the, phenomenon, theoretical, methods, that, use, an, appropriate, starting, point, orthogonal, orbitals, find, that, hyperconjugation, is, the, most, important, factor, in, the, origin, of, the, ethane, rotation, barrier, as, far, back, as, 1890, 1891, chemists, suggested, that, ethane, molecules, preferred, the, staggered, conformation, with, the, two, ends, of, the, molecule, askew, from, each, other, ethane, occurs, as, a, trace, gas, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, currently, having, a, concentration, at, sea, level, of, 0, 5, ppb, global, ethane, quantities, have, varied, over, time, likely, due, to, flaring, at, natural, gas, fields, global, ethane, emission, rates, declined, from, 1984, to, 2010, though, increased, shale, gas, production, at, the, bakken, formation, in, the, u, s, has, arrested, the, decline, by, half, although, ethane, is, a, greenhouse, gas, it, is, much, less, abundant, than, methane, has, a, lifetime, of, only, a, few, months, compared, to, over, a, decade, and, is, also, less, efficient, at, absorbing, radiation, relative, to, mass, in, fact, ethane, s, global, warming, potential, largely, results, from, its, conversion, in, the, atmosphere, to, methane, it, has, been, detected, as, a, trace, component, in, the, atmospheres, of, all, four, giant, planets, and, in, the, atmosphere, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, atmospheric, ethane, results, from, the, sun, s, photochemical, action, on, methane, gas, also, present, in, these, atmospheres, ultraviolet, photons, of, shorter, wavelengths, than, 160, nm, can, photo, dissociate, the, methane, molecule, into, a, methyl, radical, and, a, hydrogen, atom, when, two, methyl, radicals, recombine, the, result, is, ethane, in, earth, s, atmosphere, hydroxyl, radicals, convert, ethane, to, methanol, vapor, with, a, half, life, of, around, three, months, it, is, suspected, that, ethane, produced, in, this, fashion, on, titan, rains, back, onto, the, moon, s, surface, and, over, time, has, accumulated, into, hydrocarbon, seas, covering, much, of, the, moon, s, polar, regions, in, mid, 2005, the, cassini, orbiter, discovered, ontario, lacus, in, titan, s, south, polar, regions, further, analysis, of, infrared, spectroscopic, data, presented, in, july, 2008, provided, additional, evidence, for, the, presence, of, liquid, ethane, in, ontario, lacus, several, significantly, larger, hydrocarbon, lakes, ligeia, mare, and, kraken, mare, being, the, two, largest, were, discovered, near, titan, s, north, pole, using, radar, data, gathered, by, cassini, these, lakes, are, believed, to, be, filled, primarily, by, a, mixture, of, liquid, ethane, and, methane, in, 1996, ethane, was, detected, in, comet, hyakutake, and, it, has, since, been, detected, in, some, other, comets, the, existence, of, ethane, in, these, distant, solar, system, bodies, may, implicate, ethane, as, a, primordial, component, of, the, solar, nebula, from, which, the, sun, and, planets, are, believed, to, have, formed, in, 2006, dale, cruikshank, of, nasa, ames, research, center, a, new, horizons, co, investigator, and, his, colleagues, announced, the, spectroscopic, discovery, of, ethane, on, pluto, s, surface, the, chemistry, of, ethane, involves, chiefly, free, radical, reactions, ethane, can, react, with, the, halogens, especially, chlorine, and, bromine, by, free, radical, halogenation, this, reaction, proceeds, through, the, propagation, of, the, ethyl, radical, the, combustion, of, ethane, releases, 1559, 7, kj, mol, or, 51, 9, kj, g, of, heat, and, produces, carbon, dioxide, and, water, according, to, the, chemical, equation, combustion, may, also, occur, without, an, excess, of, oxygen, yielding, carbon, monoxide, acetaldehyde, methane, methanol, and, ethanol, at, higher, temperatures, especially, in, the, range, 600, 900, c, 1, 112, 1, 652, f, ethylene, is, a, significant, product, such, oxidative, dehydrogenation, reactions, are, relevant, to, the, production, of, ethylene, after, methane, ethane, is, the, second, largest, component, of, natural, gas, natural, gas, from, different, gas, fields, varies, in, ethane, content, from, less, than, 1, to, more, than, 6, by, volume, prior, to, the, 1960s, ethane, and, larger, molecules, were, typically, not, separated, from, the, methane, component, of, natural, gas, but, simply, burnt, along, with, the, methane, as, a, fuel, today, ethane, is, an, important, petrochemical, feedstock, and, is, separated, from, the, other, components, of, natural, gas, in, most, well, developed, gas, fields, ethane, can, also, be, separated, from, petroleum, gas, a, mixture, of, gaseous, hydrocarbons, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, petroleum, refining, ethane, is, most, efficiently, separated, from, methane, by, liquefying, it, at, cryogenic, temperatures, various, refrigeration, strategies, exist, the, most, economical, process, presently, in, wide, use, employs, a, turboexpander, and, can, recover, more, than, 90, of, the, ethane, in, natural, gas, in, this, process, chilled, gas, is, expanded, through, a, turbine, reducing, the, temperature, to, approximately, 100, c, 148, f, at, this, low, temperature, gaseous, methane, can, be, separated, from, the, liquefied, ethane, and, heavier, hydrocarbons, by, distillation, further, distillation, then, separates, ethane, from, the, propane, and, heavier, hydrocarbons, the, chief, use, of, ethane, is, the, production, of, ethylene, ethene, by, steam, cracking, when, diluted, with, steam, and, briefly, heated, to, very, high, temperatures, 900, c, or, more, heavy, hydrocarbons, break, down, into, lighter, hydrocarbons, and, saturated, hydrocarbons, become, unsaturated, ethane, is, favored, for, ethylene, production, because, the, steam, cracking, of, ethane, is, fairly, selective, for, ethylene, while, the, steam, cracking, of, heavier, hydrocarbons, yields, a, product, mixture, poorer, in, ethylene, and, richer, in, heavier, alkenes, olefins, such, as, propene, propylene, and, butadiene, and, in, aromatic, hydrocarbons, experimentally, ethane, is, under, investigation, as, a, feedstock, for, other, commodity, chemicals, oxidative, chlorination, of, ethane, has, long, appeared, to, be, a, potentially, more, economical, route, to, vinyl, chloride, than, ethylene, chlorination, many, processes, for, producing, this, reaction, have, been, patented, but, poor, selectivity, for, vinyl, chloride, and, corrosive, reaction, conditions, specifically, a, reaction, mixture, containing, hydrochloric, acid, at, temperatures, greater, than, 500, c, have, discouraged, the, commercialization, of, most, of, them, presently, ineos, operates, a, 1000, t, a, tonnes, per, annum, ethane, to, vinyl, chloride, pilot, plant, at, wilhelmshaven, in, germany, similarly, in, 2005, the, saudi, arabian, firm, sabic, launched, a, 34, 000, t, a, plant, at, yanbu, to, produce, acetic, acid, by, ethane, oxidation, the, economic, viability, of, this, process, may, rely, on, the, low, cost, of, ethane, near, saudi, oil, fields, and, it, may, not, be, competitive, with, methanol, carbonylation, elsewhere, in, the, world, ethane, can, be, used, as, a, refrigerant, in, cryogenic, refrigeration, systems, on, a, much, smaller, scale, in, scientific, research, liquid, ethane, is, used, to, vitrify, water, rich, samples, for, cryo, electron, microscopy, a, thin, film, of, water, quickly, immersed, in, liquid, ethane, at, 150, c, or, colder, freezes, too, quickly, for, water, to, crystallize, slower, freezing, methods, can, generate, cubic, ice, crystals, which, can, disrupt, soft, structures, by, damaging, the, samples, and, reduce, image, quality, by, scattering, the, electron, beam, before, it, can, reach, the, detector, man, energy, solutions, currently, manufactures, two, stroke, dual, fuel, engines, b, w, me, gie, which, can, run, on, both, marine, diesel, oil, and, ethane, at, room, temperature, ethane, is, an, extremely, flammable, gas, when, mixed, with, air, at, 3, 0, 12, 5, by, volume, it, forms, an, explosive, mixture, some, additional, precautions, are, necessary, where, ethane, is, stored, as, a, cryogenic, liquid, direct, contact, with, liquid, ethane, can, result, in, severe, frostbite, until, they, warm, to, room, temperature, the, vapors, from, liquid, ethane, are, heavier, than, air, and, can, flow, along, the, floor, or, ground, gathering, in, low, places, if, the, vapors, encounter, an, ignition, source, the, chemical, reaction, can, flash, back, to, the, source, of, ethane, from, which, they, evaporated, ethane, can, displace, oxygen, and, become, an, asphyxiation, hazard, ethane, poses, no, known, acute, or, chronic, toxicological, risk, it, is, not, a, carcinogen
