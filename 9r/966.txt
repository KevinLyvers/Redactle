mass, is, an, intrinsic, property, of, a, body, it, was, traditionally, believed, to, be, related, to, the, quantity, of, matter, in, a, body, until, the, discovery, of, the, atom, and, particle, physics, it, was, found, that, different, atoms, and, different, elementary, particles, theoretically, with, the, same, amount, of, matter, have, nonetheless, different, masses, mass, in, modern, physics, has, multiple, definitions, which, are, conceptually, distinct, but, physically, equivalent, mass, can, be, experimentally, defined, as, a, measure, of, the, body, s, inertia, meaning, the, resistance, to, acceleration, change, of, velocity, when, a, net, force, is, applied, the, object, s, mass, also, determines, the, strength, of, its, gravitational, attraction, to, other, bodies, the, si, base, unit, of, mass, is, the, kilogram, kg, in, physics, mass, is, not, the, same, as, weight, even, though, mass, is, often, determined, by, measuring, the, object, s, weight, using, a, spring, scale, rather, than, balance, scale, comparing, it, directly, with, known, masses, an, object, on, the, moon, would, weigh, less, than, it, does, on, earth, because, of, the, lower, gravity, but, it, would, still, have, the, same, mass, this, is, because, weight, is, a, force, while, mass, is, the, property, that, along, with, gravity, determines, the, strength, of, this, force, in, the, standard, model, of, physics, the, mass, of, elementary, particles, is, believed, to, be, a, result, of, their, coupling, with, the, higgs, boson, in, what, is, known, as, the, brout, englert, higgs, mechanism, there, are, several, distinct, phenomena, that, can, be, used, to, measure, mass, although, some, theorists, have, speculated, that, some, of, these, phenomena, could, be, independent, of, each, other, current, experiments, have, found, no, difference, in, results, regardless, of, how, it, is, measured, the, mass, of, an, object, determines, its, acceleration, in, the, presence, of, an, applied, force, the, inertia, and, the, inertial, mass, describe, this, property, of, physical, bodies, at, the, qualitative, and, quantitative, level, respectively, according, to, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, if, a, body, of, fixed, mass, m, is, subjected, to, a, single, force, f, its, acceleration, a, is, given, by, f, m, a, body, s, mass, also, determines, the, degree, to, which, it, generates, and, is, affected, by, a, gravitational, field, if, a, first, body, of, mass, m, a, is, placed, at, a, distance, r, center, of, mass, to, center, of, mass, from, a, second, body, of, mass, m, b, each, body, is, subject, to, an, attractive, force, f, g, gm, a, m, b, r, 2, where, g, 6, 67, 10, 11, n, kg, 2, m, 2, is, the, universal, gravitational, constant, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, gravitational, mass, repeated, experiments, since, the, 17th, century, have, demonstrated, that, inertial, and, gravitational, mass, are, identical, since, 1915, this, observation, has, been, incorporated, a, priori, in, the, equivalence, principle, of, general, relativity, the, international, system, of, units, si, unit, of, mass, is, the, kilogram, kg, the, kilogram, is, 1000, grams, g, and, was, first, defined, in, 1795, as, the, mass, of, one, cubic, decimetre, of, water, at, the, melting, point, of, ice, however, because, precise, measurement, of, a, cubic, decimetre, of, water, at, the, specified, temperature, and, pressure, was, difficult, in, 1889, the, kilogram, was, redefined, as, the, mass, of, a, metal, object, and, thus, became, independent, of, the, metre, and, the, properties, of, water, this, being, a, copper, prototype, of, the, grave, in, 1793, the, platinum, kilogramme, des, archives, in, 1799, and, the, platinum, iridium, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, ipk, in, 1889, however, the, mass, of, the, ipk, and, its, national, copies, have, been, found, to, drift, over, time, the, re, definition, of, the, kilogram, and, several, other, units, came, into, effect, on, 20, may, 2019, following, a, final, vote, by, the, cgpm, in, november, 2018, the, new, definition, uses, only, invariant, quantities, of, nature, the, speed, of, light, the, caesium, hyperfine, frequency, the, planck, constant, and, the, elementary, charge, non, si, units, accepted, for, use, with, si, units, include, outside, the, si, system, other, units, of, mass, include, in, physical, science, one, may, distinguish, conceptually, between, at, least, seven, different, aspects, of, mass, or, seven, physical, notions, that, involve, the, concept, of, mass, every, experiment, to, date, has, shown, these, seven, values, to, be, proportional, and, in, some, cases, equal, and, this, proportionality, gives, rise, to, the, abstract, concept, of, mass, there, are, a, number, of, ways, mass, can, be, measured, or, operationally, defined, in, everyday, usage, mass, and, weight, are, often, used, interchangeably, for, instance, a, person, s, weight, may, be, stated, as, 75, kg, in, a, constant, gravitational, field, the, weight, of, an, object, is, proportional, to, its, mass, and, it, is, unproblematic, to, use, the, same, unit, for, both, concepts, but, because, of, slight, differences, in, the, strength, of, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, at, different, places, the, distinction, becomes, important, for, measurements, with, a, precision, better, than, a, few, percent, and, for, places, far, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, such, as, in, space, or, on, other, planets, conceptually, mass, measured, in, kilograms, refers, to, an, intrinsic, property, of, an, object, whereas, weight, measured, in, newtons, measures, an, object, s, resistance, to, deviating, from, its, current, course, of, free, fall, which, can, be, influenced, by, the, nearby, gravitational, field, no, matter, how, strong, the, gravitational, field, objects, in, free, fall, are, weightless, though, they, still, have, mass, the, force, known, as, weight, is, proportional, to, mass, and, acceleration, in, all, situations, where, the, mass, is, accelerated, away, from, free, fall, for, example, when, a, body, is, at, rest, in, a, gravitational, field, rather, than, in, free, fall, it, must, be, accelerated, by, a, force, from, a, scale, or, the, surface, of, a, planetary, body, such, as, the, earth, or, the, moon, this, force, keeps, the, object, from, going, into, free, fall, weight, is, the, opposing, force, in, such, circumstances, and, is, thus, determined, by, the, acceleration, of, free, fall, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, for, example, an, object, with, a, mass, of, 50, kilograms, weighs, 491, newtons, which, means, that, 491, newtons, is, being, applied, to, keep, the, object, from, going, into, free, fall, by, contrast, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, the, same, object, still, has, a, mass, of, 50, kilograms, but, weighs, only, 81, 5, newtons, because, only, 81, 5, newtons, is, required, to, keep, this, object, from, going, into, a, free, fall, on, the, moon, restated, in, mathematical, terms, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, weight, w, of, an, object, is, related, to, its, mass, m, by, w, mg, where, g, 9, 80665, m, s, 2, is, the, acceleration, due, to, earth, s, gravitational, field, expressed, as, the, acceleration, experienced, by, a, free, falling, object, for, other, situations, such, as, when, objects, are, subjected, to, mechanical, accelerations, from, forces, other, than, the, resistance, of, a, planetary, surface, the, weight, force, is, proportional, to, the, mass, of, an, object, multiplied, by, the, total, acceleration, away, from, free, fall, which, is, called, the, proper, acceleration, through, such, mechanisms, objects, in, elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and, the, like, may, experience, weight, forces, many, times, those, caused, by, resistance, to, the, effects, of, gravity, on, objects, resulting, from, planetary, surfaces, in, such, cases, the, generalized, equation, for, weight, w, of, an, object, is, related, to, its, mass, m, by, the, equation, w, ma, where, a, is, the, proper, acceleration, of, the, object, caused, by, all, influences, other, than, gravity, again, if, gravity, is, the, only, influence, such, as, occurs, when, an, object, falls, freely, its, weight, will, be, zero, although, inertial, mass, passive, gravitational, mass, and, active, gravitational, mass, are, conceptually, distinct, no, experiment, has, ever, unambiguously, demonstrated, any, difference, between, them, in, classical, mechanics, newton, s, third, law, implies, that, active, and, passive, gravitational, mass, must, always, be, identical, or, at, least, proportional, but, the, classical, theory, offers, no, compelling, reason, why, the, gravitational, mass, has, to, equal, the, inertial, mass, that, it, does, is, merely, an, empirical, fact, albert, einstein, developed, his, general, theory, of, relativity, starting, with, the, assumption, that, the, inertial, and, passive, gravitational, masses, are, the, same, this, is, known, as, the, equivalence, principle, the, particular, equivalence, often, referred, to, as, the, galilean, equivalence, principle, or, the, weak, equivalence, principle, has, the, most, important, consequence, for, freely, falling, objects, suppose, an, object, has, inertial, and, gravitational, masses, m, and, m, respectively, if, the, only, force, acting, on, the, object, comes, from, a, gravitational, field, g, the, force, on, the, object, is, given, this, force, the, acceleration, of, the, object, can, be, determined, by, newton, s, second, law, putting, these, together, the, gravitational, acceleration, is, given, by, this, says, that, the, ratio, of, gravitational, to, inertial, mass, of, any, object, is, equal, to, some, constant, k, if, and, only, if, all, objects, fall, at, the, same, rate, in, a, given, gravitational, field, this, phenomenon, is, referred, to, as, the, universality, of, free, fall, in, addition, the, constant, k, can, be, taken, as, 1, by, defining, our, units, appropriately, the, first, experiments, demonstrating, the, universality, of, free, fall, were, according, to, scientific, folklore, conducted, by, galileo, obtained, by, dropping, objects, from, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, this, is, most, likely, apocryphal, he, is, more, likely, to, have, performed, his, experiments, with, balls, rolling, down, nearly, frictionless, inclined, planes, to, slow, the, motion, and, increase, the, timing, accuracy, increasingly, precise, experiments, have, been, performed, such, as, those, performed, by, lor, nd, e, tv, s, using, the, torsion, balance, pendulum, in, 1889, as, of, 2008, no, deviation, from, universality, and, thus, from, galilean, equivalence, has, ever, been, found, at, least, to, the, precision, 10, 6, more, precise, experimental, efforts, are, still, being, carried, out, the, universality, of, free, fall, only, applies, to, systems, in, which, gravity, is, the, only, acting, force, all, other, forces, especially, friction, and, air, resistance, must, be, absent, or, at, least, negligible, for, example, if, a, hammer, and, a, feather, are, dropped, from, the, same, height, through, the, air, on, earth, the, feather, will, take, much, longer, to, reach, the, ground, the, feather, is, not, really, in, free, fall, because, the, force, of, air, resistance, upwards, against, the, feather, is, comparable, to, the, downward, force, of, gravity, on, the, other, hand, if, the, experiment, is, performed, in, a, vacuum, in, which, there, is, no, air, resistance, the, hammer, and, the, feather, should, hit, the, ground, at, exactly, the, same, time, assuming, the, acceleration, of, both, objects, towards, each, other, and, of, the, ground, towards, both, objects, for, its, own, part, is, negligible, this, can, easily, be, done, in, a, high, school, laboratory, by, dropping, the, objects, in, transparent, tubes, that, have, the, air, removed, with, a, vacuum, pump, it, is, even, more, dramatic, when, done, in, an, environment, that, naturally, has, a, vacuum, as, david, scott, did, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, during, apollo, 15, a, stronger, version, of, the, equivalence, principle, known, as, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, or, the, strong, equivalence, principle, lies, at, the, heart, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, einstein, s, equivalence, principle, states, that, within, sufficiently, small, regions, of, space, time, it, is, impossible, to, distinguish, between, a, uniform, acceleration, and, a, uniform, gravitational, field, thus, the, theory, postulates, that, the, force, acting, on, a, massive, object, caused, by, a, gravitational, field, is, a, result, of, the, object, s, tendency, to, move, in, a, straight, line, in, other, words, its, inertia, and, should, therefore, be, a, function, of, its, inertial, mass, and, the, strength, of, the, gravitational, field, in, theoretical, physics, a, mass, generation, mechanism, is, a, theory, which, attempts, to, explain, the, origin, of, mass, from, the, most, fundamental, laws, of, physics, to, date, a, number, of, different, models, have, been, proposed, which, advocate, different, views, of, the, origin, of, mass, the, problem, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, notion, of, mass, is, strongly, related, to, the, gravitational, interaction, but, a, theory, of, the, latter, has, not, been, yet, reconciled, with, the, currently, popular, model, of, particle, physics, known, as, the, standard, model, the, concept, of, amount, is, very, old, and, predates, recorded, history, the, concept, of, weight, would, incorporate, amount, and, acquire, a, double, meaning, that, was, not, clearly, recognized, as, such, what, we, now, know, as, mass, was, until, the, time, of, newton, called, weight, a, goldsmith, believed, that, an, ounce, of, gold, was, a, quantity, of, gold, but, the, ancients, believed, that, a, beam, balance, also, measured, heaviness, which, they, recognized, through, their, muscular, senses, mass, and, its, associated, downward, force, were, believed, to, be, the, same, thing, humans, at, some, early, era, realized, that, the, weight, of, a, collection, of, similar, objects, was, directly, proportional, to, the, number, of, objects, in, the, collection, where, w, is, the, weight, of, the, collection, of, similar, objects, and, n, is, the, number, of, objects, in, the, collection, proportionality, by, definition, implies, that, two, values, have, a, constant, ratio, an, early, use, of, this, relationship, is, a, balance, scale, which, balances, the, force, of, one, object, s, weight, against, the, force, of, another, object, s, weight, the, two, sides, of, a, balance, scale, are, close, enough, that, the, objects, experience, similar, gravitational, fields, hence, if, they, have, similar, masses, then, their, weights, will, also, be, similar, this, allows, the, scale, by, comparing, weights, to, also, compare, masses, consequently, historical, weight, standards, were, often, defined, in, terms, of, amounts, the, romans, for, example, used, the, carob, seed, carat, or, siliqua, as, a, measurement, standard, if, an, object, s, weight, was, equivalent, to, 1728, carob, seeds, then, the, object, was, said, to, weigh, one, roman, pound, if, on, the, other, hand, the, object, s, weight, was, equivalent, to, 144, carob, seeds, then, the, object, was, said, to, weigh, one, roman, ounce, uncia, the, roman, pound, and, ounce, were, both, defined, in, terms, of, different, sized, collections, of, the, same, common, mass, standard, the, carob, seed, the, ratio, of, a, roman, ounce, 144, carob, seeds, to, a, roman, pound, 1728, carob, seeds, was, in, 1600, ad, johannes, kepler, sought, employment, with, tycho, brahe, who, had, some, of, the, most, precise, astronomical, data, available, using, brahe, s, precise, observations, of, the, planet, mars, kepler, spent, the, next, five, years, developing, his, own, method, for, characterizing, planetary, motion, in, 1609, johannes, kepler, published, his, three, laws, of, planetary, motion, explaining, how, the, planets, orbit, the, sun, in, kepler, s, final, planetary, model, he, described, planetary, orbits, as, following, elliptical, paths, with, the, sun, at, a, focal, point, of, the, ellipse, kepler, discovered, that, the, square, of, the, orbital, period, of, each, planet, is, directly, proportional, to, the, cube, of, the, semi, major, axis, of, its, orbit, or, equivalently, that, the, ratio, of, these, two, values, is, constant, for, all, planets, in, the, solar, system, on, 25, august, 1609, galileo, galilei, demonstrated, his, first, telescope, to, a, group, of, venetian, merchants, and, in, early, january, 1610, galileo, observed, four, dim, objects, near, jupiter, which, he, mistook, for, stars, however, after, a, few, days, of, observation, galileo, realized, that, these, stars, were, in, fact, orbiting, jupiter, these, four, objects, later, named, the, galilean, moons, in, honor, of, their, discoverer, were, the, first, celestial, bodies, observed, to, orbit, something, other, than, the, earth, or, sun, galileo, continued, to, observe, these, moons, over, the, next, eighteen, months, and, by, the, middle, of, 1611, he, had, obtained, remarkably, accurate, estimates, for, their, periods, sometime, prior, to, 1638, galileo, turned, his, attention, to, the, phenomenon, of, objects, in, free, fall, attempting, to, characterize, these, motions, galileo, was, not, the, first, to, investigate, earth, s, gravitational, field, nor, was, he, the, first, to, accurately, describe, its, fundamental, characteristics, however, galileo, s, reliance, on, scientific, experimentation, to, establish, physical, principles, would, have, a, profound, effect, on, future, generations, of, scientists, it, is, unclear, if, these, were, just, hypothetical, experiments, used, to, illustrate, a, concept, or, if, they, were, real, experiments, performed, by, galileo, but, the, results, obtained, from, these, experiments, were, both, realistic, and, compelling, a, biography, by, galileo, s, pupil, vincenzo, viviani, stated, that, galileo, had, dropped, balls, of, the, same, material, but, different, masses, from, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, to, demonstrate, that, their, time, of, descent, was, independent, of, their, mass, in, support, of, this, conclusion, galileo, had, advanced, the, following, theoretical, argument, he, asked, if, two, bodies, of, different, masses, and, different, rates, of, fall, are, tied, by, a, string, does, the, combined, system, fall, faster, because, it, is, now, more, massive, or, does, the, lighter, body, in, its, slower, fall, hold, back, the, heavier, body, the, only, convincing, resolution, to, this, question, is, that, all, bodies, must, fall, at, the, same, rate, a, later, experiment, was, described, in, galileo, s, two, new, sciences, published, in, 1638, one, of, galileo, s, fictional, characters, salviati, describes, an, experiment, using, a, bronze, ball, and, a, wooden, ramp, the, wooden, ramp, was, 12, cubits, long, half, a, cubit, wide, and, three, finger, breadths, thick, with, a, straight, smooth, polished, groove, the, groove, was, lined, with, parchment, also, smooth, and, polished, as, possible, and, into, this, groove, was, placed, a, hard, smooth, and, very, round, bronze, ball, the, ramp, was, inclined, at, various, angles, to, slow, the, acceleration, enough, so, that, the, elapsed, time, could, be, measured, the, ball, was, allowed, to, roll, a, known, distance, down, the, ramp, and, the, time, taken, for, the, ball, to, move, the, known, distance, was, measured, the, time, was, measured, using, a, water, clock, described, as, follows, galileo, found, that, for, an, object, in, free, fall, the, distance, that, the, object, has, fallen, is, always, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, elapsed, time, galileo, had, shown, that, objects, in, free, fall, under, the, influence, of, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, have, a, constant, acceleration, and, galileo, s, contemporary, johannes, kepler, had, shown, that, the, planets, follow, elliptical, paths, under, the, influence, of, the, sun, s, gravitational, mass, however, galileo, s, free, fall, motions, and, kepler, s, planetary, motions, remained, distinct, during, galileo, s, lifetime, according, to, k, m, browne, kepler, formed, a, concept, of, mass, amount, of, matter, copia, materiae, but, called, it, weight, as, did, everyone, at, that, time, finally, in, 1686, newton, gave, this, distinct, concept, its, own, name, in, the, first, paragraph, of, principia, newton, defined, quantity, of, matter, as, density, and, bulk, conjunctly, and, mass, as, quantity, of, matter, the, quantity, of, matter, is, the, measure, of, the, same, arising, from, its, density, and, bulk, conjunctly, it, is, this, quantity, that, i, mean, hereafter, everywhere, under, the, name, of, body, or, mass, and, the, same, is, known, by, the, weight, of, each, body, for, it, is, proportional, to, the, weight, robert, hooke, had, published, his, concept, of, gravitational, forces, in, 1674, stating, that, all, celestial, bodies, have, an, attraction, or, gravitating, power, towards, their, own, centers, and, also, attract, all, the, other, celestial, bodies, that, are, within, the, sphere, of, their, activity, he, further, stated, that, gravitational, attraction, increases, by, how, much, nearer, the, body, wrought, upon, is, to, its, own, center, in, correspondence, with, isaac, newton, from, 1679, and, 1680, hooke, conjectured, that, gravitational, forces, might, decrease, according, to, the, double, of, the, distance, between, the, two, bodies, hooke, urged, newton, who, was, a, pioneer, in, the, development, of, calculus, to, work, through, the, mathematical, details, of, keplerian, orbits, to, determine, if, hooke, s, hypothesis, was, correct, newton, s, own, investigations, verified, that, hooke, was, correct, but, due, to, personal, differences, between, the, two, men, newton, chose, not, to, reveal, this, to, hooke, isaac, newton, kept, quiet, about, his, discoveries, until, 1684, at, which, time, he, told, a, friend, edmond, halley, that, he, had, solved, the, problem, of, gravitational, orbits, but, had, misplaced, the, solution, in, his, office, after, being, encouraged, by, halley, newton, decided, to, develop, his, ideas, about, gravity, and, publish, all, of, his, findings, in, november, 1684, isaac, newton, sent, a, document, to, edmund, halley, now, lost, but, presumed, to, have, been, titled, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, latin, for, on, the, motion, of, bodies, in, an, orbit, halley, presented, newton, s, findings, to, the, royal, society, of, london, with, a, promise, that, a, fuller, presentation, would, follow, newton, later, recorded, his, ideas, in, a, three, book, set, entitled, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, english, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, the, first, was, received, by, the, royal, society, on, 28, april, 1685, 86, the, second, on, 2, march, 1686, 87, and, the, third, on, 6, april, 1686, 87, the, royal, society, published, newton, s, entire, collection, at, their, own, expense, in, may, 1686, 87, 31, isaac, newton, had, bridged, the, gap, between, kepler, s, gravitational, mass, and, galileo, s, gravitational, acceleration, resulting, in, the, discovery, of, the, following, relationship, which, governed, both, of, these, where, g, is, the, apparent, acceleration, of, a, body, as, it, passes, through, a, region, of, space, where, gravitational, fields, exist, is, the, gravitational, mass, standard, gravitational, parameter, of, the, body, causing, gravitational, fields, and, r, is, the, radial, coordinate, the, distance, between, the, centers, of, the, two, bodies, by, finding, the, exact, relationship, between, a, body, s, gravitational, mass, and, its, gravitational, field, newton, provided, a, second, method, for, measuring, gravitational, mass, the, mass, of, the, earth, can, be, determined, using, kepler, s, method, from, the, orbit, of, earth, s, moon, or, it, can, be, determined, by, measuring, the, gravitational, acceleration, on, the, earth, s, surface, and, multiplying, that, by, the, square, of, the, earth, s, radius, the, mass, of, the, earth, is, approximately, three, millionths, of, the, mass, of, the, sun, to, date, no, other, accurate, method, for, measuring, gravitational, mass, has, been, discovered, newton, s, cannonball, was, a, thought, experiment, used, to, bridge, the, gap, between, galileo, s, gravitational, acceleration, and, kepler, s, elliptical, orbits, it, appeared, in, newton, s, 1728, book, a, treatise, of, the, system, of, the, world, according, to, galileo, s, concept, of, gravitation, a, dropped, stone, falls, with, constant, acceleration, down, towards, the, earth, however, newton, explains, that, when, a, stone, is, thrown, horizontally, meaning, sideways, or, perpendicular, to, earth, s, gravity, it, follows, a, curved, path, for, a, stone, projected, is, by, the, pressure, of, its, own, weight, forced, out, of, the, rectilinear, path, which, by, the, projection, alone, it, should, have, pursued, and, made, to, describe, a, curve, line, in, the, air, and, through, that, crooked, way, is, at, last, brought, down, to, the, ground, and, the, greater, the, velocity, is, with, which, it, is, projected, the, farther, it, goes, before, it, falls, to, the, earth, 513, newton, further, reasons, that, if, an, object, were, projected, in, an, horizontal, direction, from, the, top, of, a, high, mountain, with, sufficient, velocity, it, would, reach, at, last, quite, beyond, the, circumference, of, the, earth, and, return, to, the, mountain, from, which, it, was, projected, in, contrast, to, earlier, theories, e, g, celestial, spheres, which, stated, that, the, heavens, were, made, of, entirely, different, material, newton, s, theory, of, mass, was, groundbreaking, partly, because, it, introduced, universal, gravitational, mass, every, object, has, gravitational, mass, and, therefore, every, object, generates, a, gravitational, field, newton, further, assumed, that, the, strength, of, each, object, s, gravitational, field, would, decrease, according, to, the, square, of, the, distance, to, that, object, if, a, large, collection, of, small, objects, were, formed, into, a, giant, spherical, body, such, as, the, earth, or, sun, newton, calculated, the, collection, would, create, a, gravitational, field, proportional, to, the, total, mass, of, the, body, 397, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, to, the, body, s, center, 221, for, example, according, to, newton, s, theory, of, universal, gravitation, each, carob, seed, produces, a, gravitational, field, therefore, if, one, were, to, gather, an, immense, number, of, carob, seeds, and, form, them, into, an, enormous, sphere, then, the, gravitational, field, of, the, sphere, would, be, proportional, to, the, number, of, carob, seeds, in, the, sphere, hence, it, should, be, theoretically, possible, to, determine, the, exact, number, of, carob, seeds, that, would, be, required, to, produce, a, gravitational, field, similar, to, that, of, the, earth, or, sun, in, fact, by, unit, conversion, it, is, a, simple, matter, of, abstraction, to, realize, that, any, traditional, mass, unit, can, theoretically, be, used, to, measure, gravitational, mass, measuring, gravitational, mass, in, terms, of, traditional, mass, units, is, simple, in, principle, but, extremely, difficult, in, practice, according, to, newton, s, theory, all, objects, produce, gravitational, fields, and, it, is, theoretically, possible, to, collect, an, immense, number, of, small, objects, and, form, them, into, an, enormous, gravitating, sphere, however, from, a, practical, standpoint, the, gravitational, fields, of, small, objects, are, extremely, weak, and, difficult, to, measure, newton, s, books, on, universal, gravitation, were, published, in, the, 1680s, but, the, first, successful, measurement, of, the, earth, s, mass, in, terms, of, traditional, mass, units, the, cavendish, experiment, did, not, occur, until, 1797, over, a, hundred, years, later, henry, cavendish, found, that, the, earth, s, density, was, 5, 448, 0, 033, times, that, of, water, as, of, 2009, the, earth, s, mass, in, kilograms, is, only, known, to, around, five, digits, of, accuracy, whereas, its, gravitational, mass, is, known, to, over, nine, significant, figures, given, two, objects, a, and, b, of, masses, m, a, and, m, b, separated, by, a, displacement, r, ab, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, states, that, each, object, exerts, a, gravitational, force, on, the, other, of, magnitude, where, g, is, the, universal, gravitational, constant, the, above, statement, may, be, reformulated, in, the, following, way, if, g, is, the, magnitude, at, a, given, location, in, a, gravitational, field, then, the, gravitational, force, on, an, object, with, gravitational, mass, m, is, this, is, the, basis, by, which, masses, are, determined, by, weighing, in, simple, spring, scales, for, example, the, force, f, is, proportional, to, the, displacement, of, the, spring, beneath, the, weighing, pan, as, per, hooke, s, law, and, the, scales, are, calibrated, to, take, g, into, account, allowing, the, mass, m, to, be, read, off, assuming, the, gravitational, field, is, equivalent, on, both, sides, of, the, balance, a, balance, measures, relative, weight, giving, the, relative, gravitation, mass, of, each, object, mass, was, traditionally, believed, to, be, a, measure, of, the, quantity, of, matter, in, a, physical, body, equal, to, the, amount, of, matter, in, an, object, for, example, barre, de, saint, venant, argued, in, 1851, that, every, object, contains, a, number, of, points, basically, interchangeable, elementary, particles, and, that, mass, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, points, the, object, contains, in, practice, this, amount, of, matter, definition, is, adequate, for, most, of, classical, mechanics, and, sometimes, remains, in, use, in, basic, education, if, the, priority, is, to, teach, the, difference, between, mass, from, weight, this, traditional, amount, of, matter, belief, was, contradicted, by, the, fact, that, different, atoms, and, later, different, elementary, particles, can, have, different, masses, and, was, further, contradicted, by, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, 1905, which, showed, that, the, measurable, mass, of, an, object, increases, when, energy, is, added, to, it, for, example, by, increasing, its, temperature, or, forcing, it, near, an, object, that, electrically, repels, it, this, motivates, a, search, for, a, different, definition, of, mass, that, is, more, accurate, than, the, traditional, definition, of, the, amount, of, matter, in, an, object, inertial, mass, is, the, mass, of, an, object, measured, by, its, resistance, to, acceleration, this, definition, has, been, championed, by, ernst, mach, and, has, since, been, developed, into, the, notion, of, operationalism, by, percy, w, bridgman, the, simple, classical, mechanics, definition, of, mass, differs, slightly, from, the, definition, in, the, theory, of, special, relativity, but, the, essential, meaning, is, the, same, in, classical, mechanics, according, to, newton, s, second, law, we, say, that, a, body, has, a, mass, m, if, at, any, instant, of, time, it, obeys, the, equation, of, motion, where, f, is, the, resultant, force, acting, on, the, body, and, a, is, the, acceleration, of, the, body, s, centre, of, mass, for, the, moment, we, will, put, aside, the, question, of, what, force, acting, on, the, body, actually, means, this, equation, illustrates, how, mass, relates, to, the, inertia, of, a, body, consider, two, objects, with, different, masses, if, we, apply, an, identical, force, to, each, the, object, with, a, bigger, mass, will, experience, a, smaller, acceleration, and, the, object, with, a, smaller, mass, will, experience, a, bigger, acceleration, we, might, say, that, the, larger, mass, exerts, a, greater, resistance, to, changing, its, state, of, motion, in, response, to, the, force, however, this, notion, of, applying, identical, forces, to, different, objects, brings, us, back, to, the, fact, that, we, have, not, really, defined, what, a, force, is, we, can, sidestep, this, difficulty, with, the, help, of, newton, s, third, law, which, states, that, if, one, object, exerts, a, force, on, a, second, object, it, will, experience, an, equal, and, opposite, force, to, be, precise, suppose, we, have, two, objects, of, constant, inertial, masses, m, 1, and, m, 2, we, isolate, the, two, objects, from, all, other, physical, influences, so, that, the, only, forces, present, are, the, force, exerted, on, m, 1, by, m, 2, which, we, denote, f, 12, and, the, force, exerted, on, m, 2, by, m, 1, which, we, denote, f, 21, newton, s, second, law, states, that, where, a, 1, and, a, 2, are, the, accelerations, of, m, 1, and, m, 2, respectively, suppose, that, these, accelerations, are, non, zero, so, that, the, forces, between, the, two, objects, are, non, zero, this, occurs, for, example, if, the, two, objects, are, in, the, process, of, colliding, with, one, another, newton, s, third, law, then, states, that, and, thus, if, a, 1, is, non, zero, the, fraction, is, well, defined, which, allows, us, to, measure, the, inertial, mass, of, m, 1, in, this, case, m, 2, is, our, reference, object, and, we, can, define, its, mass, m, as, say, 1, kilogram, then, we, can, measure, the, mass, of, any, other, object, in, the, universe, by, colliding, it, with, the, reference, object, and, measuring, the, accelerations, additionally, mass, relates, a, body, s, momentum, p, to, its, linear, velocity, v, and, the, body, s, kinetic, energy, k, to, its, velocity, the, primary, difficulty, with, mach, s, definition, of, mass, is, that, it, fails, to, take, into, account, the, potential, energy, or, binding, energy, needed, to, bring, two, masses, sufficiently, close, to, one, another, to, perform, the, measurement, of, mass, this, is, most, vividly, demonstrated, by, comparing, the, mass, of, the, proton, in, the, nucleus, of, deuterium, to, the, mass, of, the, proton, in, free, space, which, is, greater, by, about, 0, 239, this, is, due, to, the, binding, energy, of, deuterium, thus, for, example, if, the, reference, weight, m, 2, is, taken, to, be, the, mass, of, the, neutron, in, free, space, and, the, relative, accelerations, for, the, proton, and, neutron, in, deuterium, are, computed, then, the, above, formula, over, estimates, the, mass, m, 1, by, 0, 239, for, the, proton, in, deuterium, at, best, mach, s, formula, can, only, be, used, to, obtain, ratios, of, masses, that, is, as, m, 1, m, 2, a, 2, a, 1, an, additional, difficulty, was, pointed, out, by, henri, poincar, which, is, that, the, measurement, of, instantaneous, acceleration, is, impossible, unlike, the, measurement, of, time, or, distance, there, is, no, way, to, measure, acceleration, with, a, single, measurement, one, must, make, multiple, measurements, of, position, time, etc, and, perform, a, computation, to, obtain, the, acceleration, poincar, termed, this, to, be, an, insurmountable, flaw, in, the, mach, definition, of, mass, typically, the, mass, of, objects, is, measured, in, terms, of, the, kilogram, which, since, 2019, is, defined, in, terms, of, fundamental, constants, of, nature, the, mass, of, an, atom, or, other, particle, can, be, compared, more, precisely, and, more, conveniently, to, that, of, another, atom, and, thus, scientists, developed, the, dalton, also, known, as, the, unified, atomic, mass, unit, by, definition, 1, da, one, dalton, is, exactly, one, twelfth, of, the, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, and, thus, a, carbon, 12, atom, has, a, mass, of, exactly, 12, da, in, some, frameworks, of, special, relativity, physicists, have, used, different, definitions, of, the, term, in, these, frameworks, two, kinds, of, mass, are, defined, rest, mass, invariant, mass, and, relativistic, mass, which, increases, with, velocity, rest, mass, is, the, newtonian, mass, as, measured, by, an, observer, moving, along, with, the, object, relativistic, mass, is, the, total, quantity, of, energy, in, a, body, or, system, divided, by, c, 2, the, two, are, related, by, the, following, equation, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, lorentz, factor, the, invariant, mass, of, systems, is, the, same, for, observers, in, all, inertial, frames, while, the, relativistic, mass, depends, on, the, observer, s, frame, of, reference, in, order, to, formulate, the, equations, of, physics, such, that, mass, values, do, not, change, between, observers, it, is, convenient, to, use, rest, mass, the, rest, mass, of, a, body, is, also, related, to, its, energy, e, and, the, magnitude, of, its, momentum, p, by, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, equation, so, long, as, the, system, is, closed, with, respect, to, mass, and, energy, both, kinds, of, mass, are, conserved, in, any, given, frame, of, reference, the, conservation, of, mass, holds, even, as, some, types, of, particles, are, converted, to, others, matter, particles, such, as, atoms, may, be, converted, to, non, matter, particles, such, as, photons, of, light, but, this, does, not, affect, the, total, amount, of, mass, or, energy, although, things, like, heat, may, not, be, matter, all, types, of, energy, still, continue, to, exhibit, mass, thus, mass, and, energy, do, not, change, into, one, another, in, relativity, rather, both, are, names, for, the, same, thing, and, neither, mass, nor, energy, appear, without, the, other, both, rest, and, relativistic, mass, can, be, expressed, as, an, energy, by, applying, the, well, known, relationship, e, mc, 2, yielding, rest, energy, and, relativistic, energy, total, system, energy, respectively, the, relativistic, mass, and, energy, concepts, are, related, to, their, rest, counterparts, but, they, do, not, have, the, same, value, as, their, rest, counterparts, in, systems, where, there, is, a, net, momentum, because, the, relativistic, mass, is, proportional, to, the, energy, it, has, gradually, fallen, into, disuse, among, physicists, there, is, disagreement, over, whether, the, concept, remains, useful, pedagogically, in, bound, systems, the, binding, energy, must, often, be, subtracted, from, the, mass, of, the, unbound, system, because, binding, energy, commonly, leaves, the, system, at, the, time, it, is, bound, the, mass, of, the, system, changes, in, this, process, merely, because, the, system, was, not, closed, during, the, binding, process, so, the, energy, escaped, for, example, the, binding, energy, of, atomic, nuclei, is, often, lost, in, the, form, of, gamma, rays, when, the, nuclei, are, formed, leaving, nuclides, which, have, less, mass, than, the, free, particles, nucleons, of, which, they, are, composed, mass, energy, equivalence, also, holds, in, macroscopic, systems, for, example, if, one, takes, exactly, one, kilogram, of, ice, and, applies, heat, the, mass, of, the, resulting, melt, water, will, be, more, than, a, kilogram, it, will, include, the, mass, from, the, thermal, energy, latent, heat, used, to, melt, the, ice, this, follows, from, the, conservation, of, energy, this, number, is, small, but, not, negligible, about, 3, 7, nanograms, it, is, given, by, the, latent, heat, of, melting, ice, 334, kj, kg, divided, by, the, speed, of, light, squared, c, 2, 9, 10, 16, m, 2, s, 2, in, general, relativity, the, equivalence, principle, is, the, equivalence, of, gravitational, and, inertial, mass, at, the, core, of, this, assertion, is, albert, einstein, s, idea, that, the, gravitational, force, as, experienced, locally, while, standing, on, a, massive, body, such, as, the, earth, is, the, same, as, the, pseudo, force, experienced, by, an, observer, in, a, non, inertial, i, e, accelerated, frame, of, reference, however, it, turns, out, that, it, is, impossible, to, find, an, objective, general, definition, for, the, concept, of, invariant, mass, in, general, relativity, at, the, core, of, the, problem, is, the, non, linearity, of, the, einstein, field, equations, making, it, impossible, to, write, the, gravitational, field, energy, as, part, of, the, stress, energy, tensor, in, a, way, that, is, invariant, for, all, observers, for, a, given, observer, this, can, be, achieved, by, the, stress, energy, momentum, pseudotensor, in, classical, mechanics, the, inert, mass, of, a, particle, appears, in, the, euler, lagrange, equation, as, a, parameter, m, after, quantization, replacing, the, position, vector, x, with, a, wave, function, the, parameter, m, appears, in, the, kinetic, energy, operator, in, the, ostensibly, covariant, relativistically, invariant, dirac, equation, and, in, natural, units, this, becomes, where, the, mass, parameter, m, is, now, simply, a, constant, associated, with, the, quantum, described, by, the, wave, function, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, as, developed, in, the, 1960s, this, term, arises, from, the, coupling, of, the, field, to, an, additional, field, the, higgs, field, in, the, case, of, fermions, the, higgs, mechanism, results, in, the, replacement, of, the, term, m, in, the, lagrangian, with, g, displaystyle, g, psi, overline, psi, phi, psi, this, shifts, the, explanandum, of, the, value, for, the, mass, of, each, elementary, particle, to, the, value, of, the, unknown, coupling, constant, g, a, tachyonic, field, or, simply, tachyon, is, a, quantum, field, with, an, imaginary, mass, although, tachyons, particles, that, move, faster, than, light, are, a, purely, hypothetical, concept, not, generally, believed, to, exist, fields, with, imaginary, mass, have, come, to, play, an, important, role, in, modern, physics, and, are, discussed, in, popular, books, on, physics, under, no, circumstances, do, any, excitations, ever, propagate, faster, than, light, in, such, theories, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, tachyonic, mass, has, no, effect, whatsoever, on, the, maximum, velocity, of, signals, there, is, no, violation, of, causality, while, the, field, may, have, imaginary, mass, any, physical, particles, do, not, the, imaginary, mass, shows, that, the, system, becomes, unstable, and, sheds, the, instability, by, undergoing, a, type, of, phase, transition, called, tachyon, condensation, closely, related, to, second, order, phase, transitions, that, results, in, symmetry, breaking, in, current, models, of, particle, physics, the, term, tachyon, was, coined, by, gerald, feinberg, in, a, 1967, paper, but, it, was, soon, realized, that, feinberg, s, model, in, fact, did, not, allow, for, superluminal, speeds, instead, the, imaginary, mass, creates, an, instability, in, the, configuration, any, configuration, in, which, one, or, more, field, excitations, are, tachyonic, will, spontaneously, decay, and, the, resulting, configuration, contains, no, physical, tachyons, this, process, is, known, as, tachyon, condensation, well, known, examples, include, the, condensation, of, the, higgs, boson, in, particle, physics, and, ferromagnetism, in, condensed, matter, physics, although, the, notion, of, a, tachyonic, imaginary, mass, might, seem, troubling, because, there, is, no, classical, interpretation, of, an, imaginary, mass, the, mass, is, not, quantized, rather, the, scalar, field, is, even, for, tachyonic, quantum, fields, the, field, operators, at, spacelike, separated, points, still, commute, or, anticommute, thus, preserving, causality, therefore, information, still, does, not, propagate, faster, than, light, and, solutions, grow, exponentially, but, not, superluminally, there, is, no, violation, of, causality, tachyon, condensation, drives, a, physical, system, that, has, reached, a, local, limit, and, might, naively, be, expected, to, produce, physical, tachyons, to, an, alternate, stable, state, where, no, physical, tachyons, exist, once, the, tachyonic, field, reaches, the, minimum, of, the, potential, its, quanta, are, not, tachyons, any, more, but, rather, are, ordinary, particles, with, a, positive, mass, squared, this, is, a, special, case, of, the, general, rule, where, unstable, massive, particles, are, formally, described, as, having, a, complex, mass, with, the, real, part, being, their, mass, in, the, usual, sense, and, the, imaginary, part, being, the, decay, rate, in, natural, units, however, in, quantum, field, theory, a, particle, a, one, particle, state, is, roughly, defined, as, a, state, which, is, constant, over, time, i, e, an, eigenvalue, of, the, hamiltonian, an, unstable, particle, is, a, state, which, is, only, approximately, constant, over, time, if, it, exists, long, enough, to, be, measured, it, can, be, formally, described, as, having, a, complex, mass, with, the, real, part, of, the, mass, greater, than, its, imaginary, part, if, both, parts, are, of, the, same, magnitude, this, is, interpreted, as, a, resonance, appearing, in, a, scattering, process, rather, than, a, particle, as, it, is, considered, not, to, exist, long, enough, to, be, measured, independently, of, the, scattering, process, in, the, case, of, a, tachyon, the, real, part, of, the, mass, is, zero, and, hence, no, concept, of, a, particle, can, be, attributed, to, it, in, a, lorentz, invariant, theory, the, same, formulas, that, apply, to, ordinary, slower, than, light, particles, sometimes, called, bradyons, in, discussions, of, tachyons, must, also, apply, to, tachyons, in, particular, the, energy, momentum, relation, where, p, is, the, relativistic, momentum, of, the, bradyon, and, m, is, its, rest, mass, should, still, apply, along, with, the, formula, for, the, total, energy, of, a, particle, this, equation, shows, that, the, total, energy, of, a, particle, bradyon, or, tachyon, contains, a, contribution, from, its, rest, mass, the, rest, mass, energy, and, a, contribution, from, its, motion, the, kinetic, energy, when, v, is, larger, than, c, the, denominator, in, the, equation, for, the, energy, is, imaginary, as, the, value, under, the, radical, is, negative, because, the, total, energy, must, be, real, the, numerator, must, also, be, imaginary, i, e, the, rest, mass, m, must, be, imaginary, as, a, pure, imaginary, number, divided, by, another, pure, imaginary, number, is, a, real, number
