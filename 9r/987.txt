in, physics, and, mechanics, torque, is, the, rotational, analogue, of, linear, force, it, is, also, referred, to, as, the, moment, of, force, also, abbreviated, to, moment, the, symbol, for, torque, is, typically, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, the, lowercase, greek, letter, tau, when, being, referred, to, as, moment, of, force, it, is, commonly, denoted, by, m, just, as, a, linear, force, is, a, push, or, a, pull, applied, to, a, body, a, torque, can, be, thought, of, as, a, twist, applied, to, an, object, with, respect, to, a, chosen, point, for, example, driving, a, screw, uses, torque, which, is, applied, by, the, screwdriver, rotating, around, its, axis, a, force, of, three, newtons, applied, two, metres, from, the, fulcrum, for, example, exerts, the, same, torque, as, a, force, of, one, newton, applied, six, metres, from, the, fulcrum, the, term, torque, from, latin, torqu, re, to, twist, is, said, to, have, been, suggested, by, james, thomson, and, appeared, in, print, in, april, 1884, usage, is, attested, the, same, year, by, silvanus, p, thompson, in, the, first, edition, of, dynamo, electric, machinery, thompson, motivates, the, term, as, follows, just, as, the, newtonian, definition, of, force, is, that, which, produces, or, tends, to, produce, motion, along, a, line, so, torque, may, be, defined, as, that, which, produces, or, tends, to, produce, torsion, around, an, axis, it, is, better, to, use, a, term, which, treats, this, action, as, a, single, definite, entity, than, to, use, terms, like, couple, and, moment, which, suggest, more, complex, ideas, the, single, notion, of, a, twist, applied, to, turn, a, shaft, is, better, than, the, more, complex, notion, of, applying, a, linear, force, or, a, pair, of, forces, with, a, certain, leverage, today, torque, is, referred, to, using, different, vocabulary, depending, on, geographical, location, and, field, of, study, this, article, follows, the, definition, used, in, us, physics, in, its, usage, of, the, word, torque, in, the, uk, and, in, us, mechanical, engineering, torque, is, referred, to, as, moment, of, force, usually, shortened, to, moment, this, terminology, can, be, traced, back, to, at, least, 1811, in, sim, on, denis, poisson, s, trait, de, m, canique, an, english, translation, of, poisson, s, work, appears, in, 1842, a, force, applied, perpendicularly, to, a, lever, multiplied, by, its, distance, from, the, lever, s, fulcrum, the, length, of, the, lever, arm, is, its, torque, therefore, torque, is, defined, as, the, product, of, the, magnitude, of, the, perpendicular, component, of, the, force, and, the, distance, of, the, line, of, action, of, a, force, from, the, point, around, which, it, is, being, determined, in, three, dimensions, the, torque, is, a, pseudovector, for, point, particles, it, is, given, by, the, cross, product, of, the, displacement, vector, and, the, force, vector, the, direction, of, the, torque, can, be, determined, by, using, the, right, hand, grip, rule, if, the, fingers, of, the, right, hand, are, curled, from, the, direction, of, the, lever, arm, to, the, direction, of, the, force, then, the, thumb, points, in, the, direction, of, the, torque, it, follows, that, the, torque, vector, is, perpendicular, to, both, the, position, and, force, vectors, and, defines, the, plane, in, which, the, two, vectors, lie, the, resulting, torque, vector, direction, is, determined, by, the, right, hand, rule, therefore, any, force, directed, parallel, to, the, particle, s, position, vector, does, not, produce, a, torque, the, magnitude, of, torque, applied, to, a, rigid, body, depends, on, three, quantities, the, force, applied, the, lever, arm, vector, connecting, the, point, about, which, the, torque, is, being, measured, to, the, point, of, force, application, and, the, angle, between, the, force, and, lever, arm, vectors, in, symbols, r, f, r, f, r, f, sin, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, mathbf, r, times,

rotational, analogue, of, newton, s, second, law, for, point, particles, and, is, valid, for, any, type, of, trajectory, in, some, simple, cases, like, a, rotating, disc, where, only, the, moment, of, inertia, on, rotating, axis, is, the, rotational, newton, s, second, law, can, be, i, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, i, boldsymbol, alpha, where, displaystyle, boldsymbol, alpha, dot, boldsymbol, omega, the, definition, of, angular, momentum, for, a, single, point, particle, is, l, r, p, displaystyle, mathbf, l, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, p, where, p, is, the, particle, s, linear, momentum, and, r, is, the, position, vector, from, the, origin, the, time, derivative, of, this, is, d, l, d, t, r, d, p, d, t, d, r, d, t, p, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, mathrm, d, t, mathbf, r, times, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, p, mathrm, d, t, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, r, mathrm, d, t, times, mathbf, p, this, result, can, easily, be, proven, by, splitting, the, vectors, into, components, and, applying, the, product, rule, but, because, the, rate, of, change, of, linear, momentum, is, force, f, textstyle, mathbf, f, and, the, rate, of, change, of, position, is, velocity, v, textstyle, mathbf, v, d, l, d, t, r, f, v, p, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, mathrm, d, t, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, p, the, cross, product, of, momentum, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, with, its, associated, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, zero, because, velocity, and, momentum, are, parallel, so, the, second, term, vanishes, therefore, torque, on, a, particle, is, equal, to, the, first, derivative, of, its, angular, momentum, with, respect, to, time, if, multiple, forces, are, applied, according, newton, s, second, law, it, follows, that, d, l, d, t, r, f, n, e, t, n, e, t, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, mathrm, d, t, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, mathrm, net, boldsymbol, tau, mathrm, net, this, is, a, general, proof, for, point, particles, but, it, can, be, generalized, to, a, system, of, point, particles, by, applying, the, above, proof, to, each, of, the, point, particles, and, then, summing, over, all, the, point, particles, similarly, the, proof, can, be, generalized, to, a, continuous, mass, by, applying, the, above, proof, to, each, point, within, the, mass, and, then, integrating, over, the, entire, mass, in, physics, rotatum, is, the, derivative, of, torque, with, respect, to, time, p, d, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, p, frac, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, tau, mathrm, d, t, where, is, torque, this, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, rot, tus, meaning, to, rotate, but, the, term, rotatum, is, not, universally, recognized, but, is, commonly, used, there, is, not, a, universally, accepted, lexicon, to, indicate, the, successive, derivatives, of, rotatum, even, if, sometimes, various, proposals, have, been, made, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, can, also, be, used, to, understand, torque, if, a, force, is, allowed, to, act, through, a, distance, it, is, doing, mechanical, work, similarly, if, torque, is, allowed, to, act, through, an, angular, displacement, it, is, doing, work, mathematically, for, rotation, about, a, fixed, axis, through, the, center, of, mass, the, work, w, can, be, expressed, as, w, 1, 2, d, displaystyle, w, int, theta, 1, theta, 2, tau, mathrm, d, theta, where, is, torque, and, 1, and, 2, represent, respectively, the, initial, and, final, angular, positions, of, the, body, it, follows, from, the, work, energy, principle, that, w, also, represents, the, change, in, the, rotational, kinetic, energy, e, r, of, the, body, given, by, e, r, 1, 2, i, 2, displaystyle, e, mathrm, r, tfrac, 1, 2, i, omega, 2, where, i, is, the, moment, of, inertia, of, the, body, and, is, its, angular, speed, power, is, the, work, per, unit, time, given, by, p, displaystyle, p, boldsymbol, tau, cdot, boldsymbol, omega, where, p, is, power, is, torque, is, the, angular, velocity, and, displaystyle, cdot, represents, the, scalar, product, algebraically, the, equation, may, be, rearranged, to, compute, torque, for, a, given, angular, speed, and, power, output, the, power, injected, by, the, torque, depends, only, on, the, instantaneous, angular, speed, not, on, whether, the, angular, speed, increases, decreases, or, remains, constant, while, the, torque, is, being, applied, this, is, equivalent, to, the, linear, case, where, the, power, injected, by, a, force, depends, only, on, the, instantaneous, speed, not, on, the, resulting, acceleration, if, any, the, work, done, by, a, variable, force, acting, over, a, finite, linear, displacement, s, displaystyle, s, is, given, by, integrating, the, force, with, respect, to, an, elemental, linear,

displacement, d, s, displaystyle, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, is, related, to, a, corresponding, angular, displacement, d, displaystyle, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, and, the, radius, vector, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, as, d, s, d, r, displaystyle, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, times, mathbf, r, substitution, in, the, above, expression, for, work, gives, w, s, 1, s, 2, f, d, r, displaystyle, w, int, s, 1, s, 2, mathbf, f, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, times, mathbf, r, the, expression, inside, the, integral, is, a, scalar, triple, product, f, d, r, r, f, d, displaystyle, mathbf, f, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, times, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, but, as, per, the, definition, of, torque, and, since, the, parameter, of, integration, has, been, changed, from, linear, displacement, to, angular, displacement, the, equation, becomes, w, 1, 2, d, displaystyle, w, int, theta, 1, theta, 2, boldsymbol, tau, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, theta, if, the, torque, and, the, angular, displacement, are, in, the, same, direction, then, the, scalar, product, reduces, to, a, product, of, magnitudes, i, e, d,

2, d, displaystyle, w, int, theta, 1, theta, 2, tau, mathrm, d, theta, the, principle, of, moments, also, known, as, varignon, s, theorem, not, to, be, confused, with, the, geometrical, theorem, of, the, same, name, states, that, the, resultant, torques, due, to, several, forces, applied, to, about, a, point, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, contributing, torques, r, 1, f, 1, r, 2, f, 2, r, n, f, n, displaystyle, tau, mathbf, r, 1, times, mathbf, f, 1, mathbf, r, 2, times, mathbf, f, 2, ldots, mathbf, r, n, times, mathbf, f, n, from, this, it, follows, that, the, torques, resulting, from, n, number, of, forces, acting, around, a, pivot, on, an, object, are, balanced, when, r, 1, f, 1, r, 2, f, 2, r, n, f, n, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 1, times, mathbf, f, 1, mathbf, r, 2, times, mathbf, f, 2, ldots, mathbf, r, n, times, mathbf, f, n, mathbf, 0, torque, has, the, dimension, of, force, times, distance, symbolically, t, 2, l, 2, m, and, those, fundamental, dimensions, are, the, same, as, that, for, energy, or, work, official, si, literature, indicates, newton, metre, is, properly, denoted, n, m, as, the, unit, for, torque, although, this, is, dimensionally, equivalent, to, the, joule, which, is, the, unit, of, energy, the, latter, can, never, used, for, torque, in, the, case, of, torque, the, unit, is, assigned, to, a, vector, whereas, for, energy, it, is, assigned, to, a, scalar, this, means, that, the, dimensional, equivalence, of, the, newton, metre, and, the, joule, may, be, applied, in, the, former, but, not, in, the, latter, case, this, problem, is, addressed, in, orientational, analysis, which, treats, the, radian, as, a, base, unit, rather, than, as, a, dimensionless, unit, the, traditional, imperial, units, for, torque, are, the, pound, foot, lbf, ft, or, for, small, values, the, pound, inch, lbf, in, in, the, us, torque, is, most, commonly, referred, to, as, the, foot, pound, denoted, as, either, lb, ft, or, ft, lb, and, the, inch, pound, denoted, as, in, lb, practitioners, depend, on, context, and, the, hyphen, in, the, abbreviation, to, know, that, these, refer, to, torque, and, not, to, energy, or, moment, of, mass, as, the, symbolism, ft, lb, would, properly, imply, a, conversion, factor, may, be, necessary, when, using, different, units, of, power, or, torque, for, example, if, rotational, speed, unit, revolution, per, minute, or, second, is, used, in, place, of, angular, speed, unit, radian, per, second, we, must, multiply, by, 2, radians, per, revolution, in, the, following, formulas, p, is, power, is, torque, and, greek, letter, nu, is, rotational, speed, p, 2, displaystyle, p, tau, cdot, 2, pi, cdot, nu, showing, units, p, w, n, m, 2, r, a, d, r, e, v, r, e, v, s, displaystyle, p, rm, w, tau, rm, n, cdot, m, cdot, 2, pi, rm, rad, rev, cdot, nu, rm, rev, s, dividing, by, 60, seconds, per, minute, gives, us, the, following, p, w, n, m, 2, r, a, d, r, e, v, r, e, v, m, i, n, 60, s, m, i, n, displaystyle, p, rm, w, frac, tau, rm, n, cdot, m, cdot, 2, pi, rm, rad, rev, cdot, nu, rm, rev, min, rm, 60, s, min, where, rotational, speed, is, in, revolutions, per, minute, rpm, rev, min, some, people, e, g, american, automotive, engineers, use, horsepower, mechanical, for, power, foot, pounds, lbf, ft, for, torque, and, rpm, for, rotational, speed, this, results, in, the, formula, changing, to, p, h, p, l, b, f,

pounds, per, minute, changes, with, the, definition, of, the, horsepower, for, example, using, metric, horsepower, it, becomes, approximately, 32, 550, the, use, of, other, units, e, g, btu, per, hour, for, power, would, require, a, different, custom, conversion, factor, for, a, rotating, object, the, linear, distance, covered, at, the, circumference, of, rotation, is, the, product, of, the, radius, with, the, angle, covered, that, is, linear, distance, radius, angular, distance, and, by, definition, linear, distance, linear, speed, time, radius, angular, speed, time, by, the, definition, of, torque, torque, radius, force, we, can, rearrange, this, to, determine, force, torque, radius, these, two, values, can, be, substituted, into, the, definition, of, power, power, force, linear,

however, angular, speed, must, be, in, radians, per, unit, of, time, by, the, assumed, direct, relationship, between, linear, speed, and, angular, speed, at, the, beginning, of, the, derivation, if, the, rotational, speed, is, measured, in, revolutions, per, unit, of, time, the, linear, speed, and, distance, are, increased, proportionately, by, 2, in, the, above, derivation, to, give, power,

as, the, definition, of, torque, in, fields, other, than, physics, is, as, follows, moment, arm, force, displaystyle, tau, text, moment, arm, text, force, the, construction, of, the, moment, arm, is, shown, in, the, figure, to, the, right, along, with, the, vectors, r, and, f, mentioned, above, the, problem, with, this, definition, is, that, it, does, not, give, the, direction, of, the, torque, but, only, the, magnitude, and, hence, it, is, difficult, to, use, in, three, dimensional, cases, if, the, force, is, perpendicular, to, the, displacement, vector, r, the, moment, arm, will, be, equal, to, the, distance, to, the, centre, and, torque, will, be, a, maximum, for, the, given, force, the, equation, for, the, magnitude, of, a, torque, arising, from, a, perpendicular, force,

applying, force, in, the, plane, of, movement, and, perpendicular, to, the, wrench, for, an, object, to, be, in, static, equilibrium, not, only, must, the, sum, of, the, forces, be, zero, but, also, the, sum, of, the, torques, moments, about, any, point, for, a, two, dimensional, situation, with, horizontal, and, vertical, forces, the, sum, of, the, forces, requirement, is, two, equations, h, 0,

the, drive, shaft, internal, combustion, engines, produce, useful, torque, only, over, a, limited, range, of, rotational, speeds, typically, from, around, 1, 000, 6, 000, rpm, for, a, small, car, one, can, measure, the, varying, torque, output, over, that, range, with, a, dynamometer, and, show, it, as, a, torque, curve, steam, engines, and, electric, motors, tend, to, produce, maximum, torque, close, to, zero, rpm, with, the, torque, diminishing, as, rotational, speed, rises, due, to, increasing, friction, and, other, constraints, reciprocating, steam, engines, and, electric, motors, can, start, heavy, loads, from, zero, rpm, without, a, clutch, in, practice, the, relationship, between, power, and, torque, can, be, observed, in, bicycles, bicycles, are, typically, composed, of, two, road, wheels, front, and, rear, gears, referred, to, as, sprockets, meshing, with, a, chain, and, a, derailleur, mechanism, if, the, bicycle, s, transmission, system, allows, multiple, gear, ratios,

conveys, the, received, power, to, the, road, as, the, output, power, of, the, bicycle, depending, on, the, gear, ratio, of, the, bicycle, a, torque, angular, speed, input, pair, is, converted, to, a, torque, angular, speed, output, pair, by, using, a, larger, rear, gear, or, by, switching, to, a, lower, gear, in, multi, speed, bicycles, angular, speed, of, the, road, wheels, is, decreased, while, the, torque, is, increased, product, of, which, i, e, power, does, not, change, torque, can, be, multiplied, via, three, methods, by, locating, the, fulcrum, such, that, the, length, of, a, lever, is, increased, by, using, a, longer, lever, or, by, the, use, of, a, speed, reducing, gearset, or, gear, box, such, a, mechanism, multiplies, torque, as, rotation, rate, is, reduced
