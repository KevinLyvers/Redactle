a, crystal, or, crystalline, solid, is, a, solid, material, whose, constituents, such, as, atoms, molecules, or, ions, are, arranged, in, a, highly, ordered, microscopic, structure, forming, a, crystal, lattice, that, extends, in, all, directions, in, addition, macroscopic, single, crystals, are, usually, identifiable, by, their, geometrical, shape, consisting, of, flat, faces, with, specific, characteristic, orientations, the, scientific, study, of, crystals, and, crystal, formation, is, known, as, crystallography, the, process, of, crystal, formation, via, mechanisms, of, crystal, growth, is, called, crystallization, or, solidification, the, word, crystal, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, krustallos, meaning, both, ice, and, rock, crystal, from, kruos, icy, cold, frost, examples, of, large, crystals, include, snowflakes, diamonds, and, table, salt, most, inorganic, solids, are, not, crystals, but, polycrystals, i, e, many, microscopic, crystals, fused, together, into, a, single, solid, polycrystals, include, most, metals, rocks, ceramics, and, ice, a, third, category, of, solids, is, amorphous, solids, where, the, atoms, have, no, periodic, structure, whatsoever, examples, of, amorphous, solids, include, glass, wax, and, many, plastics, despite, the, name, lead, crystal, crystal, glass, and, related, products, are, not, crystals, but, rather, types, of, glass, i, e, amorphous, solids, crystals, or, crystalline, solids, are, often, used, in, pseudoscientific, practices, such, as, crystal, therapy, and, along, with, gemstones, are, sometimes, associated, with, spellwork, in, wiccan, beliefs, and, related, religious, movements, the, scientific, definition, of, a, crystal, is, based, on, the, microscopic, arrangement, of, atoms, inside, it, called, the, crystal, structure, a, crystal, is, a, solid, where, the, atoms, form, a, periodic, arrangement, quasicrystals, are, an, exception, see, below, not, all, solids, are, crystals, for, example, when, liquid, water, starts, freezing, the, phase, change, begins, with, small, ice, crystals, that, grow, until, they, fuse, forming, a, polycrystalline, structure, in, the, final, block, of, ice, each, of, the, small, crystals, called, crystallites, or, grains, is, a, true, crystal, with, a, periodic, arrangement, of, atoms, but, the, whole, polycrystal, does, not, have, a, periodic, arrangement, of, atoms, because, the, periodic, pattern, is, broken, at, the, grain, boundaries, most, macroscopic, inorganic, solids, are, polycrystalline, including, almost, all, metals, ceramics, ice, rocks, etc, solids, that, are, neither, crystalline, nor, polycrystalline, such, as, glass, are, called, amorphous, solids, also, called, glassy, vitreous, or, noncrystalline, these, have, no, periodic, order, even, microscopically, there, are, distinct, differences, between, crystalline, solids, and, amorphous, solids, most, notably, the, process, of, forming, a, glass, does, not, release, the, latent, heat, of, fusion, but, forming, a, crystal, does, a, crystal, structure, an, arrangement, of, atoms, in, a, crystal, is, characterized, by, its, unit, cell, a, small, imaginary, box, containing, one, or, more, atoms, in, a, specific, spatial, arrangement, the, unit, cells, are, stacked, in, three, dimensional, space, to, form, the, crystal, the, symmetry, of, a, crystal, is, constrained, by, the, requirement, that, the, unit, cells, stack, perfectly, with, no, gaps, there, are, 219, possible, crystal, symmetries, 230, is, commonly, cited, but, this, treats, chiral, equivalents, as, separate, entities, called, crystallographic, space, groups, these, are, grouped, into, 7, crystal, systems, such, as, cubic, crystal, system, where, the, crystals, may, form, cubes, or, rectangular, boxes, such, as, halite, shown, at, right, or, hexagonal, crystal, system, where, the, crystals, may, form, hexagons, such, as, ordinary, water, ice, crystals, are, commonly, recognized, macroscopically, by, their, shape, consisting, of, flat, faces, with, sharp, angles, these, shape, characteristics, are, not, necessary, for, a, crystal, a, crystal, is, scientifically, defined, by, its, microscopic, atomic, arrangement, not, its, macroscopic, shape, but, the, characteristic, macroscopic, shape, is, often, present, and, easy, to, see, euhedral, crystals, are, those, that, have, obvious, well, formed, flat, faces, anhedral, crystals, do, not, usually, because, the, crystal, is, one, grain, in, a, polycrystalline, solid, the, flat, faces, also, called, facets, of, a, euhedral, crystal, are, oriented, in, a, specific, way, relative, to, the, underlying, atomic, arrangement, of, the, crystal, they, are, planes, of, relatively, low, miller, index, this, occurs, because, some, surface, orientations, are, more, stable, than, others, lower, surface, energy, as, a, crystal, grows, new, atoms, attach, easily, to, the, rougher, and, less, stable, parts, of, the, surface, but, less, easily, to, the, flat, stable, surfaces, therefore, the, flat, surfaces, tend, to, grow, larger, and, smoother, until, the, whole, crystal, surface, consists, of, these, plane, surfaces, see, diagram, on, right, one, of, the, oldest, techniques, in, the, science, of, crystallography, consists, of, measuring, the, three, dimensional, orientations, of, the, faces, of, a, crystal, and, using, them, to, infer, the, underlying, crystal, symmetry, a, crystal, s, crystallographic, forms, are, sets, of, possible, faces, of, the, crystal, that, are, related, by, one, of, the, symmetries, of, the, crystal, for, example, crystals, of, galena, often, take, the, shape, of, cubes, and, the, six, faces, of, the, cube, belong, to, a, crystallographic, form, that, displays, one, of, the, symmetries, of, the, isometric, crystal, system, galena, also, sometimes, crystallizes, as, octahedrons, and, the, eight, faces, of, the, octahedron, belong, to, another, crystallographic, form, reflecting, a, different, symmetry, of, the, isometric, system, a, crystallographic, form, is, described, by, placing, the, miller, indices, of, one, of, its, faces, within, brackets, for, example, the, octahedral, form, is, written, as, 111, and, the, other, faces, in, the, form, are, implied, by, the, symmetry, of, the, crystal, forms, may, be, closed, meaning, that, the, form, can, completely, enclose, a, volume, of, space, or, open, meaning, that, it, cannot, the, cubic, and, octahedral, forms, are, examples, of, closed, forms, all, the, forms, of, the, isometric, system, are, closed, while, all, the, forms, of, the, monoclinic, and, triclinic, crystal, systems, are, open, a, crystal, s, faces, may, all, belong, to, the, same, closed, form, or, they, may, be, a, combination, of, multiple, open, or, closed, forms, a, crystal, s, habit, is, its, visible, external, shape, this, is, determined, by, the, crystal, structure, which, restricts, the, possible, facet, orientations, the, specific, crystal, chemistry, and, bonding, which, may, favor, some, facet, types, over, others, and, the, conditions, under, which, the, crystal, formed, by, volume, and, weight, the, largest, concentrations, of, crystals, in, the, earth, are, part, of, its, solid, bedrock, crystals, found, in, rocks, typically, range, in, size, from, a, fraction, of, a, millimetre, to, several, centimetres, across, although, exceptionally, large, crystals, are, occasionally, found, as, of, 1999, the, world, s, largest, known, naturally, occurring, crystal, is, a, crystal, of, beryl, from, malakialina, madagascar, 18, m, 59, ft, long, and, 3, 5, m, 11, ft, in, diameter, and, weighing, 380, 000, kg, 840, 000, lb, some, crystals, have, formed, by, magmatic, and, metamorphic, processes, giving, origin, to, large, masses, of, crystalline, rock, the, vast, majority, of, igneous, rocks, are, formed, from, molten, magma, and, the, degree, of, crystallization, depends, primarily, on, the, conditions, under, which, they, solidified, such, rocks, as, granite, which, have, cooled, very, slowly, and, under, great, pressures, have, completely, crystallized, but, many, kinds, of, lava, were, poured, out, at, the, surface, and, cooled, very, rapidly, and, in, this, latter, group, a, small, amount, of, amorphous, or, glassy, matter, is, common, other, crystalline, rocks, the, metamorphic, rocks, such, as, marbles, mica, schists, and, quartzites, are, recrystallized, this, means, that, they, were, at, first, fragmental, rocks, like, limestone, shale, and, sandstone, and, have, never, been, in, a, molten, condition, nor, entirely, in, solution, but, the, high, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, of, metamorphism, have, acted, on, them, by, erasing, their, original, structures, and, inducing, recrystallization, in, the, solid, state, other, rock, crystals, have, formed, out, of, precipitation, from, fluids, commonly, water, to, form, druses, or, quartz, veins, evaporites, such, as, halite, gypsum, and, some, limestones, have, been, deposited, from, aqueous, solution, mostly, owing, to, evaporation, in, arid, climates, water, based, ice, in, the, form, of, snow, sea, ice, and, glaciers, are, common, crystalline, polycrystalline, structures, on, earth, and, other, planets, a, single, snowflake, is, a, single, crystal, or, a, collection, of, crystals, while, an, ice, cube, is, a, polycrystal, ice, crystals, may, form, from, cooling, liquid, water, below, its, freezing, point, such, as, ice, cubes, or, a, frozen, lake, frost, snowflakes, or, small, ice, crystals, suspended, in, the, air, ice, fog, more, often, grow, from, a, supersaturated, gaseous, solution, of, water, vapor, and, air, when, the, temperature, of, the, air, drops, below, its, dew, point, without, passing, through, a, liquid, state, another, unusual, property, of, water, is, that, it, expands, rather, than, contracts, when, it, crystallizes, many, living, organisms, are, able, to, produce, crystals, grown, from, an, aqueous, solution, for, example, calcite, and, aragonite, in, the, case, of, most, molluscs, or, hydroxylapatite, in, the, case, of, bones, and, teeth, in, vertebrates, the, same, group, of, atoms, can, often, solidify, in, many, different, ways, polymorphism, is, the, ability, of, a, solid, to, exist, in, more, than, one, crystal, form, for, example, water, ice, is, ordinarily, found, in, the, hexagonal, form, ice, i, h, but, can, also, exist, as, the, cubic, ice, i, c, the, rhombohedral, ice, ii, and, many, other, forms, the, different, polymorphs, are, usually, called, different, phases, in, addition, the, same, atoms, may, be, able, to, form, noncrystalline, phases, for, example, water, can, also, form, amorphous, ice, while, sio, 2, can, form, both, fused, silica, an, amorphous, glass, and, quartz, a, crystal, likewise, if, a, substance, can, form, crystals, it, can, also, form, polycrystals, for, pure, chemical, elements, polymorphism, is, known, as, allotropy, for, example, diamond, and, graphite, are, two, crystalline, forms, of, carbon, while, amorphous, carbon, is, a, noncrystalline, form, polymorphs, despite, having, the, same, atoms, may, have, very, different, properties, for, example, diamond, is, the, hardest, substance, known, while, graphite, is, so, soft, that, it, is, used, as, a, lubricant, chocolate, can, form, six, different, types, of, crystals, but, only, one, has, the, suitable, hardness, and, melting, point, for, candy, bars, and, confections, polymorphism, in, steel, is, responsible, for, its, ability, to, be, heat, treated, giving, it, a, wide, range, of, properties, polyamorphism, is, a, similar, phenomenon, where, the, same, atoms, can, exist, in, more, than, one, amorphous, solid, form, crystallization, is, the, process, of, forming, a, crystalline, structure, from, a, fluid, or, from, materials, dissolved, in, a, fluid, more, rarely, crystals, may, be, deposited, directly, from, gas, see, epitaxy, and, frost, crystallization, is, a, complex, and, extensively, studied, field, because, depending, on, the, conditions, a, single, fluid, can, solidify, into, many, different, possible, forms, it, can, form, a, single, crystal, perhaps, with, various, possible, phases, stoichiometries, impurities, defects, and, habits, or, it, can, form, a, polycrystal, with, various, possibilities, for, the, size, arrangement, orientation, and, phase, of, its, grains, the, final, form, of, the, solid, is, determined, by, the, conditions, under, which, the, fluid, is, being, solidified, such, as, the, chemistry, of, the, fluid, the, ambient, pressure, the, temperature, and, the, speed, with, which, all, these, parameters, are, changing, specific, industrial, techniques, to, produce, large, single, crystals, called, boules, include, the, czochralski, process, and, the, bridgman, technique, other, less, exotic, methods, of, crystallization, may, be, used, depending, on, the, physical, properties, of, the, substance, including, hydrothermal, synthesis, sublimation, or, simply, solvent, based, crystallization, large, single, crystals, can, be, created, by, geological, processes, for, example, selenite, crystals, in, excess, of, 10, m, are, found, in, the, cave, of, the, crystals, in, naica, mexico, for, more, details, on, geological, crystal, formation, see, above, crystals, can, also, be, formed, by, biological, processes, see, above, conversely, some, organisms, have, special, techniques, to, prevent, crystallization, from, occurring, such, as, antifreeze, proteins, an, ideal, crystal, has, every, atom, in, a, perfect, exactly, repeating, pattern, however, in, reality, most, crystalline, materials, have, a, variety, of, crystallographic, defects, places, where, the, crystal, s, pattern, is, interrupted, the, types, and, structures, of, these, defects, may, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, properties, of, the, materials, a, few, examples, of, crystallographic, defects, include, vacancy, defects, an, empty, space, where, an, atom, should, fit, interstitial, defects, an, extra, atom, squeezed, in, where, it, does, not, fit, and, dislocations, see, figure, at, right, dislocations, are, especially, important, in, materials, science, because, they, help, determine, the, mechanical, strength, of, materials, another, common, type, of, crystallographic, defect, is, an, impurity, meaning, that, the, wrong, type, of, atom, is, present, in, a, crystal, for, example, a, perfect, crystal, of, diamond, would, only, contain, carbon, atoms, but, a, real, crystal, might, perhaps, contain, a, few, boron, atoms, as, well, these, boron, impurities, change, the, diamond, s, color, to, slightly, blue, likewise, the, only, difference, between, ruby, and, sapphire, is, the, type, of, impurities, present, in, a, corundum, crystal, in, semiconductors, a, special, type, of, impurity, called, a, dopant, drastically, changes, the, crystal, s, electrical, properties, semiconductor, devices, such, as, transistors, are, made, possible, largely, by, putting, different, semiconductor, dopants, into, different, places, in, specific, patterns, twinning, is, a, phenomenon, somewhere, between, a, crystallographic, defect, and, a, grain, boundary, like, a, grain, boundary, a, twin, boundary, has, different, crystal, orientations, on, its, two, sides, but, unlike, a, grain, boundary, the, orientations, are, not, random, but, related, in, a, specific, mirror, image, way, mosaicity, is, a, spread, of, crystal, plane, orientations, a, mosaic, crystal, consists, of, smaller, crystalline, units, that, are, somewhat, misaligned, with, respect, to, each, other, in, general, solids, can, be, held, together, by, various, types, of, chemical, bonds, such, as, metallic, bonds, ionic, bonds, covalent, bonds, van, der, waals, bonds, and, others, none, of, these, are, necessarily, crystalline, or, non, crystalline, however, there, are, some, general, trends, as, follows, metals, crystallize, rapidly, and, are, almost, always, polycrystalline, though, there, are, exceptions, like, amorphous, metal, and, single, crystal, metals, the, latter, are, grown, synthetically, for, example, fighter, jet, turbines, are, typically, made, by, first, growing, a, single, crystal, of, titanium, alloy, increasing, its, strength, and, melting, point, over, polycrystalline, titanium, a, small, piece, of, metal, may, naturally, form, into, a, single, crystal, such, as, type, 2, telluric, iron, but, larger, pieces, generally, do, not, unless, extremely, slow, cooling, occurs, for, example, iron, meteorites, are, often, composed, of, single, crystal, or, many, large, crystals, that, may, be, several, meters, in, size, due, to, very, slow, cooling, in, the, vacuum, of, space, the, slow, cooling, may, allow, the, precipitation, of, a, separate, phase, within, the, crystal, lattice, which, form, at, specific, angles, determined, by, the, lattice, called, widmanstatten, patterns, ionic, compounds, typically, form, when, a, metal, reacts, with, a, non, metal, such, as, sodium, with, chlorine, these, often, form, substances, called, salts, such, as, sodium, chloride, table, salt, or, potassium, nitrate, saltpeter, with, crystals, that, are, often, brittle, and, cleave, relatively, easily, ionic, materials, are, usually, crystalline, or, polycrystalline, in, practice, large, salt, crystals, can, be, created, by, solidification, of, a, molten, fluid, or, by, crystallization, out, of, a, solution, some, ionic, compounds, can, be, very, hard, such, as, oxides, like, aluminium, oxide, found, in, many, gemstones, such, as, ruby, and, synthetic, sapphire, covalently, bonded, solids, sometimes, called, covalent, network, solids, are, typically, formed, from, one, or, more, non, metals, such, as, carbon, or, silicon, and, oxygen, and, are, often, very, hard, rigid, and, brittle, these, are, also, very, common, notable, examples, being, diamond, and, quartz, respectively, weak, van, der, waals, forces, also, help, hold, together, certain, crystals, such, as, crystalline, molecular, solids, as, well, as, the, interlayer, bonding, in, graphite, substances, such, as, fats, lipids, and, wax, form, molecular, bonds, because, the, large, molecules, do, not, pack, as, tightly, as, atomic, bonds, this, leads, to, crystals, that, are, much, softer, and, more, easily, pulled, apart, or, broken, common, examples, include, chocolates, candles, or, viruses, water, ice, and, dry, ice, are, examples, of, other, materials, with, molecular, bonding, polymer, materials, generally, will, form, crystalline, regions, but, the, lengths, of, the, molecules, usually, prevent, complete, crystallization, and, sometimes, polymers, are, completely, amorphous, a, quasicrystal, consists, of, arrays, of, atoms, that, are, ordered, but, not, strictly, periodic, they, have, many, attributes, in, common, with, ordinary, crystals, such, as, displaying, a, discrete, pattern, in, x, ray, diffraction, and, the, ability, to, form, shapes, with, smooth, flat, faces, quasicrystals, are, most, famous, for, their, ability, to, show, five, fold, symmetry, which, is, impossible, for, an, ordinary, periodic, crystal, see, crystallographic, restriction, theorem, the, international, union, of, crystallography, has, redefined, the, term, crystal, to, include, both, ordinary, periodic, crystals, and, quasicrystals, any, solid, having, an, essentially, discrete, diffraction, diagram, quasicrystals, first, discovered, in, 1982, are, quite, rare, in, practice, only, about, 100, solids, are, known, to, form, quasicrystals, compared, to, about, 400, 000, periodic, crystals, known, in, 2004, the, 2011, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, to, dan, shechtman, for, the, discovery, of, quasicrystals, crystals, can, have, certain, special, electrical, optical, and, mechanical, properties, that, glass, and, polycrystals, normally, cannot, these, properties, are, related, to, the, anisotropy, of, the, crystal, i, e, the, lack, of, rotational, symmetry, in, its, atomic, arrangement, one, such, property, is, the, piezoelectric, effect, where, a, voltage, across, the, crystal, can, shrink, or, stretch, it, another, is, birefringence, where, a, double, image, appears, when, looking, through, a, crystal, moreover, various, properties, of, a, crystal, including, electrical, conductivity, electrical, permittivity, and, young, s, modulus, may, be, different, in, different, directions, in, a, crystal, for, example, graphite, crystals, consist, of, a, stack, of, sheets, and, although, each, individual, sheet, is, mechanically, very, strong, the, sheets, are, rather, loosely, bound, to, each, other, therefore, the, mechanical, strength, of, the, material, is, quite, different, depending, on, the, direction, of, stress, not, all, crystals, have, all, of, these, properties, conversely, these, properties, are, not, quite, exclusive, to, crystals, they, can, appear, in, glasses, or, polycrystals, that, have, been, made, anisotropic, by, working, or, stress, for, example, stress, induced, birefringence, crystallography, is, the, science, of, measuring, the, crystal, structure, in, other, words, the, atomic, arrangement, of, a, crystal, one, widely, used, crystallography, technique, is, x, ray, diffraction, large, numbers, of, known, crystal, structures, are, stored, in, crystallographic,
