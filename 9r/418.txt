tantalum, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ta, and, atomic, number, 73, previously, known, as, tantalium, it, is, named, after, tantalus, a, figure, in, greek, mythology, tantalum, is, a, very, hard, ductile, lustrous, blue, gray, transition, metal, that, is, highly, corrosion, resistant, it, is, part, of, the, refractory, metals, group, which, are, widely, used, as, components, of, strong, high, melting, point, alloys, it, is, a, group, 5, element, along, with, vanadium, and, niobium, and, it, always, occurs, in, geologic, sources, together, with, the, chemically, similar, niobium, mainly, in, the, mineral, groups, tantalite, columbite, and, coltan, the, chemical, inertness, and, very, high, melting, point, of, tantalum, make, it, valuable, for, laboratory, and, industrial, equipment, such, as, reaction, vessels, and, vacuum, furnaces, it, is, used, in, tantalum, capacitors, for, electronic, equipment, such, as, computers, it, is, being, investigated, for, use, as, a, material, for, high, quality, superconducting, resonators, in, quantum, processors, tantalum, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, by, the, european, commission, tantalum, was, discovered, in, sweden, in, 1802, by, anders, ekeberg, in, two, mineral, samples, one, from, sweden, and, the, other, from, finland, one, year, earlier, charles, hatchett, had, discovered, columbium, now, niobium, in, 1809, the, english, chemist, william, hyde, wollaston, compared, the, oxides, of, columbium, and, tantalum, columbite, and, tantalite, although, the, two, oxides, had, different, measured, densities, of, 5, 918, g, cm, 3, and, 7, 935, g, cm, 3, he, concluded, that, they, were, identical, and, kept, the, name, tantalum, after, friedrich, w, hler, confirmed, these, results, it, was, thought, that, columbium, and, tantalum, were, the, same, element, this, conclusion, was, disputed, in, 1846, by, the, german, chemist, heinrich, rose, who, argued, that, there, were, two, additional, elements, in, the, tantalite, sample, and, he, named, them, after, the, children, of, tantalus, niobium, from, niobe, the, goddess, of, tears, and, pelopium, from, pelops, the, supposed, element, pelopium, was, later, identified, as, a, mixture, of, tantalum, and, niobium, and, it, was, found, that, the, niobium, was, identical, to, the, columbium, already, discovered, in, 1801, by, hatchett, the, differences, between, tantalum, and, niobium, were, demonstrated, unequivocally, in, 1864, by, christian, wilhelm, blomstrand, and, henri, etienne, sainte, claire, deville, as, well, as, by, louis, j, troost, who, determined, the, empirical, formulas, of, some, of, their, compounds, in, 1865, further, confirmation, came, from, the, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, in, 1866, who, proved, that, there, were, only, two, elements, these, discoveries, did, not, stop, scientists, from, publishing, articles, about, the, so, called, ilmenium, until, 1871, de, marignac, was, the, first, to, produce, the, metallic, form, of, tantalum, in, 1864, when, he, reduced, tantalum, chloride, by, heating, it, in, an, atmosphere, of, hydrogen, early, investigators, had, only, been, able, to, produce, impure, tantalum, and, the, first, relatively, pure, ductile, metal, was, produced, by, werner, von, bolton, in, charlottenburg, in, 1903, wires, made, with, metallic, tantalum, were, used, for, light, bulb, filaments, until, tungsten, replaced, it, in, widespread, use, the, name, tantalum, was, derived, from, the, name, of, the, mythological, tantalus, the, father, of, niobe, in, greek, mythology, in, the, story, he, had, been, punished, after, death, by, being, condemned, to, stand, knee, deep, in, water, with, perfect, fruit, growing, above, his, head, both, of, which, eternally, tantalized, him, if, he, bent, to, drink, the, water, it, drained, below, the, level, he, could, reach, and, if, he, reached, for, the, fruit, the, branches, moved, out, of, his, grasp, anders, ekeberg, wrote, this, metal, i, call, tantalum, partly, in, allusion, to, its, incapacity, when, immersed, in, acid, to, absorb, any, and, be, saturated, for, decades, the, commercial, technology, for, separating, tantalum, from, niobium, involved, the, fractional, crystallization, of, potassium, heptafluorotantalate, away, from, potassium, oxypentafluoroniobate, monohydrate, a, process, that, was, discovered, by, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, in, 1866, this, method, has, been, supplanted, by, solvent, extraction, from, fluoride, containing, solutions, of, tantalum, tantalum, is, dark, blue, gray, dense, ductile, very, hard, easily, fabricated, and, highly, conductive, of, heat, and, electricity, the, metal, is, highly, resistant, to, corrosion, by, acids, at, temperatures, below, 150, c, tantalum, is, almost, completely, immune, to, attack, by, the, normally, aggressive, aqua, regia, it, can, be, dissolved, with, hydrofluoric, acid, or, acidic, solutions, containing, the, fluoride, ion, and, sulfur, trioxide, as, well, as, with, molten, potassium, hydroxide, tantalum, s, high, melting, point, of, 3017, c, boiling, point, 5458, c, is, exceeded, among, the, elements, only, by, tungsten, rhenium, and, osmium, for, metals, and, carbon, tantalum, exists, in, two, crystalline, phases, alpha, and, beta, the, alpha, phase, is, stable, at, all, temperatures, up, to, the, melting, point, and, has, body, centered, cubic, structure, with, lattice, constant, a, 0, 33029, nm, at, 20, c, it, is, relatively, ductile, has, knoop, hardness, 200, 400, hn, and, electrical, resistivity, 15, 60, cm, the, beta, phase, is, hard, and, brittle, its, crystal, symmetry, is, tetragonal, space, group, p42, mnm, a, 1,

phase, upon, heating, to, 750, 775, c, bulk, tantalum, is, almost, entirely, alpha, phase, and, the, beta, phase, usually, exists, as, thin, films, obtained, by, magnetron, sputtering, chemical, vapor, deposition, or, electrochemical, deposition, from, a, eutectic, molten, salt, solution, natural, tantalum, consists, of, two, stable, isotopes, 180m, ta, 0, 012, and, 181, ta, 99, 988, 180m, ta, m, denotes, a, metastable, state, is, predicted, to, decay, in, three, ways, isomeric, transition, to, the, ground, state, of, 180, ta, beta, decay, to, 180, w, or, electron, capture, to, 180, hf, however, radioactivity, of, this, nuclear, isomer, has, never, been, observed, and, only, a, lower, limit, on, its, half, life, of, 2, 9, 10, 17, years, has, been, set, the, ground, state, of, 180, ta, has, a, half, life, of, only, 8, hours, 180m, ta, is, the, only, naturally, occurring, nuclear, isomer, excluding, radiogenic, and, cosmogenic, short, lived, nuclides, it, is, also, the, rarest, primordial, isotope, in, the, universe, taking, into, account, the, elemental, abundance, of, tantalum, and, isotopic, abundance, of, 180m, ta, in, the, natural, mixture, of, isotopes, and, again, excluding, radiogenic, and, cosmogenic, short, lived, nuclides, tantalum, has, been, examined, theoretically, as, a, salting, material, for, nuclear, weapons, cobalt, is, the, better, known, hypothetical, salting, material, an, external, shell, of, 181, ta, would, be, irradiated, by, the, intensive, high, energy, neutron, flux, from, a, hypothetical, exploding, nuclear, weapon, this, would, transmute, the, tantalum, into, the, radioactive, isotope, 182, ta, which, has, a, half, life, of, 114, 4, days, and, produces, gamma, rays, with, approximately, 1, 12, million, electron, volts, mev, of, energy, apiece, which, would, significantly, increase, the, radioactivity, of, the, nuclear, fallout, from, the, explosion, for, several, months, such, salted, weapons, have, never, been, built, or, tested, as, far, as, is, publicly, known, and, certainly, never, used, as, weapons, tantalum, can, be, used, as, a, target, material, for, accelerated, proton, beams, for, the, production, of, various, short, lived, isotopes, including, 8, li, 80, rb, and, 160, yb, tantalum, forms, compounds, in, oxidation, states, iii, to, v, most, commonly, encountered, are, oxides, of, ta, v, which, includes, all, minerals, the, chemical, properties, of, ta, and, nb, are, very, similar, in, aqueous, media, ta, only, exhibit, the, v, oxidation, state, like, niobium, tantalum, is, barely, soluble, in, dilute, solutions, of, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, and, phosphoric, acids, due, to, the, precipitation, of, hydrous, ta, v, oxide, in, basic, media, ta, can, be, solubilized, due, to, the, formation, of, polyoxotantalate, species, tantalum, pentoxide, ta, 2, o, 5, is, the, most, important, compound, from, the, perspective, of, applications, oxides, of, tantalum, in, lower, oxidation, states, are, numerous, including, many, defect, structures, and, are, lightly, studied, or, poorly, characterized, tantalates, compounds, containing, 3, or, are, numerous, lithium, tantalate, litao, 3, adopts, a, perovskite, structure, lanthanum, tantalate, latao, 4, contains, isolated, tao, 3, 4, tetrahedra, as, in, the, cases, of, other, refractory, metals, the, hardest, known, compounds, of, tantalum, are, nitrides, and, carbides, tantalum, carbide, tac, like, the, more, commonly, used, tungsten, carbide, is, a, hard, ceramic, that, is, used, in, cutting, tools, tantalum, iii, nitride, is, used, as, a, thin, film, insulator, in, some, microelectronic, fabrication, processes, the, best, studied, chalcogenide, is, tas, 2, a, layered, semiconductor, as, seen,

is, a, white, solid, with, a, melting, point, of, 97, 0, c, the, anion, 2, is, used, for, its, separation, from, niobium, the, chloride, tacl, 5, which, exists, as, a, dimer, is, the, main, reagent, in, synthesis, of, new, ta, compounds, it, hydrolyzes, readily, to, an, oxychloride, the, lower, halides, tax, 4, and, tax, 3, feature, ta, ta, bonds, organotantalum, compounds, include, pentamethyltantalum, mixed, alkyltantalum, chlorides, alkyltantalum, hydrides, alkylidene, complexes, as, well, as, cyclopentadienyl, derivatives, of, the, same, diverse, salts, and, substituted, derivatives, are, known, for, the, hexacarbonyl, and, related, isocyanides, tantalum, is, estimated, to, make, up, about, 1, ppm, or, 2, ppm, of, the, earth, s, crust, by, weight, there, are, many, species, of, tantalum, minerals, only, some, of, which, are, so, far, being, used, by, industry, as, raw, materials, tantalite, a, series, consisting, of, tantalite, fe, tantalite, mn, and, tantalite, mg, microlite, now, a, group, name, wodginite, euxenite, actually, euxenite, y, and, polycrase, actually, polycrase, y, tantalite, fe, mn, ta, 2, o, 6, is, the, most, important, mineral, for, tantalum, extraction, tantalite, has, the, same, mineral, structure, as, columbite, fe, mn, ta, nb, 2, o, 6, when, there, is, more, tantalum, than, niobium, it, is, called, tantalite, and, when, there, is, more, niobium, than, tantalum, is, it, called, columbite, or, niobite, the, high, density, of, tantalite, and, other, tantalum, containing, minerals, makes, the, use, of, gravitational, separation, the, best, method, other, minerals, include, samarskite, and, fergusonite, australia, was, the, main, producer, of, tantalum, prior, to, the, 2010s, with, global, advanced, metals, formerly, known, as, talison, minerals, being, the, largest, tantalum, mining, company, in, that, country, they, operate, two, mines, in, western, australia, greenbushes, in, the, southwest, and, wodgina, in, the, pilbara, region, the, wodgina, mine, was, reopened, in, january, 2011, after, mining, at, the, site, was, suspended, in, late, 2008, due, to, the, global, financial, crisis, less, than, a, year, after, it, reopened, global, advanced, metals, announced, that, due, to, again, softening, tantalum, demand, and, other, factors, tantalum, mining, operations, were, to, cease, at, the, end, of, february, 2012, wodgina, produces, a, primary, tantalum, concentrate, which, is, further, upgraded, at, the, greenbushes, operation, before, being, sold, to, customers, whereas, the, large, scale, producers, of, niobium, are, in, brazil, and, canada, the, ore, there, also, yields, a, small, percentage, of, tantalum, some, other, countries, such, as, china, ethiopia, and, mozambique, mine, ores, with, a, higher, percentage, of, tantalum, and, they, produce, a, significant, percentage, of, the, world, s, output, of, it, tantalum, is, also, produced, in, thailand, and, malaysia, as, a, by, product, of, the, tin, mining, there, during, gravitational, separation, of, the, ores, from, placer, deposits, not, only, is, cassiterite, sno, 2, found, but, a, small, percentage, of, tantalite, also, included, the, slag, from, the, tin, smelters, then, contains, economically, useful, amounts, of, tantalum, which, is, leached, from, the, slag, world, tantalum, mine, production, has, undergone, an, important, geographic, shift, since, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, when, production, was, predominantly, from, australia, and, brazil, beginning, in, 2007, and, through, 2014, the, major, sources, of, tantalum, production, from, mines, dramatically, shifted, to, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, rwanda, and, some, other, african, countries, future, sources, of, supply, of, tantalum, in, order, of, estimated, size, are, being, explored, in, saudi, arabia, egypt, greenland, china, mozambique, canada, australia, the, united, states, finland, and, brazil, tantalum, is, considered, a, conflict, resource, coltan, the, industrial, name, for, a, columbite, tantalite, mineral, from, which, niobium, and, tantalum, are, extracted, can, also, be, found, in, central, africa, which, is, why, tantalum, is, being, linked, to, warfare, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, formerly, zaire, according, to, an, october, 23, 2003, united, nations, report, the, smuggling, and, exportation, of, coltan, has, helped, fuel, the, war, in, the, congo, a, crisis, that, has, resulted, in, approximately, 5, 4, million, deaths, since, 1998, making, it, the, world, s, deadliest, documented, conflict, since, world, war, ii, ethical, questions, have, been, raised, about, responsible, corporate, behavior, human, rights, and, endangering, wildlife, due, to, the, exploitation, of, resources, such, as, coltan, in, the, armed, conflict, regions, of, the, congo, basin, the, united, states, geological, survey, reports, in, its, yearbook, that, this, region, produced, a, little, less, than, 1, of, the, world, s, tantalum, output, in, 2002, 2006, peaking, at, 10, in, 2000, and, 2008, usgs, data, published, in, january, 2021, indicated, that, close, to, 40, of, the, world, s, tantalum, mine, production, came, from, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, with, another, 18, coming, from, neighboring, rwanda, and, burundi, several, steps, are, involved, in, the, extraction, of, tantalum, from, tantalite, first, the, mineral, is, crushed, and, concentrated, by, gravity, separation, this, is, generally, carried, out, near, the, mine, site, the, refining, of, tantalum, from, its, ores, is, one, of, the, more, demanding, separation, processes, in, industrial, metallurgy, the, chief, problem, is, that, tantalum, ores, contain, significant, amounts, of, niobium, which, has, chemical, properties, almost, identical, to, those, of, ta, a, large, number, of, procedures, have, been, developed, to, address, this, challenge, in, modern, times, the, separation, is, achieved, by, hydrometallurgy, extraction, begins, with, leaching, the, ore, with, hydrofluoric, acid, together, with, sulfuric, acid, or, hydrochloric, acid, this, step, allows, the, tantalum, and, niobium, to, be, separated, from, the, various, non, metallic, impurities, in, the, rock, although, ta, occurs, as, various, minerals, it, is, conveniently, represented, as, the, pentoxide, since, most, oxides, of, tantalum, v, behave, similarly, under, these, conditions, a, simplified, equation, for, its, extraction, is, thus, completely, analogous, reactions, occur, for, the, niobium, component, but, the, hexafluoride, is, typically, predominant, under, the, conditions, of, the, extraction, these, equations, are, simplified, it, is, suspected, that, bisulfate, hso, 4, and, chloride, compete, as, ligands, for, the, nb, v, and, ta, v, ions, when, sulfuric, and, hydrochloric, acids, are, used, respectively, the, tantalum, and, niobium, fluoride, complexes, are, then, removed, from, the, aqueous, solution, by, liquid, liquid, extraction, into, organic, solvents, such, as, cyclohexanone, octanol, and, methyl, isobutyl, ketone, this, simple, procedure, allows, the, removal, of, most, metal, containing, impurities, e, g, iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium, which, remain, in, the, aqueous, phase, in, the, form, of, their, fluorides, and, other, complexes, separation, of, the, tantalum, from, niobium, is, then, achieved, by, lowering, the, ionic, strength, of, the, acid, mixture, which, causes, the, niobium, to, dissolve, in, the, aqueous, phase, it, is, proposed, that, oxyfluoride, h, 2, is, formed, under, these, conditions, subsequent, to, removal, of, the, niobium, the, solution, of, purified, h, 2, is, neutralised, with, aqueous, ammonia, to, precipitate, hydrated, tantalum, oxide, as, a, solid, which, can, be, calcined, to, tantalum, pentoxide, ta, 2, o, 5, instead, of, hydrolysis, the, h, 2, can, be, treated, with, potassium, fluoride, to, produce, potassium, heptafluorotantalate, unlike, h, 2, the, potassium, salt, is, readily, crystallized, and, handled, as, a, solid, k, 2, can, be, converted, to, metallic, tantalum, by, reduction, with, sodium, at, approximately, 800, c, in, molten, salt, in, an, older, method, called, the, marignac, process, the, mixture, of, h, 2, and, h, 2, was, converted, to, a, mixture, of, k, 2, and, k, 2, which, was, then, separated, by, fractional, crystallization, exploiting, their, different, water, solubilities, tantalum, can, also, be, refined, by, electrolysis, using, a, modified, version, of, the, hall, h, roult, process, instead, of, requiring, the, input, oxide, and, output, metal, to, be, in, liquid, form, tantalum, electrolysis, operates, on, non, liquid, powdered, oxides, the, initial, discovery, came, in, 1997, when, cambridge, university, researchers, immersed, small, samples, of, certain, oxides, in, baths, of, molten, salt, and, reduced, the, oxide, with, electric, current, the, cathode, uses, powdered, metal, oxide, the, anode, is, made, of, carbon, the, molten, salt, at, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, is, the, electrolyte, the, first, refinery, has, enough, capacity, to, supply, 3, 4, of, annual, global, demand, all, welding, of, tantalum, must, be, done, in, an, inert, atmosphere, of, argon, or, helium, in, order, to, shield, it, from, contamination, with, atmospheric, gases, tantalum, is, not, solderable, grinding, tantalum, is, difficult, especially, so, for, annealed, tantalum, in, the, annealed, condition, tantalum, is, extremely, ductile, and, can, be, readily, formed, as, metal, sheets, the, major, use, for, tantalum, as, the, metal, powder, is, in, the, production, of, electronic, components, mainly, capacitors, and, some, high, power, resistors, tantalum, electrolytic, capacitors, exploit, the, tendency, of, tantalum, to, form, a, protective, oxide, surface, layer, using, tantalum, powder, pressed, into, a, pellet, shape, as, one, plate, of, the, capacitor, the, oxide, as, the, dielectric, and, an, electrolytic, solution, or, conductive, solid, as, the, other, plate, because, the, dielectric, layer, can, be, very, thin, thinner, than, the, similar, layer, in, for, instance, an, aluminium, electrolytic, capacitor, a, high, capacitance, can, be, achieved, in, a, small, volume, because, of, the, size, and, weight, advantages, tantalum, capacitors, are, attractive, for, portable, telephones, personal, computers, automotive, electronics, and, cameras, tantalum, is, also, used, to, produce, a, variety, of, alloys, that, have, high, melting, points, strength, and, ductility, alloyed, with, other, metals, it, is, also, used, in, making, carbide, tools, for, metalworking, equipment, and, in, the, production, of, superalloys, for, jet, engine, components, chemical, process, equipment, nuclear, reactors, missile, parts, heat, exchangers, tanks, and, vessels, because, of, its, ductility, tantalum, can, be, drawn, into, fine, wires, or, filaments, which, are, used, for, evaporating, metals, such, as, aluminium, since, it, resists, attack, by, body, fluids, and, is, nonirritating, tantalum, is, widely, used, in, making, surgical, instruments, and, implants, for, example, porous, tantalum, coatings, are, used, in, the, construction, of, orthopedic, implants, due, to, tantalum, s, ability, to, form, a, direct, bond, to, hard, tissue, tantalum, is, inert, against, most, acids, except, hydrofluoric, acid, and, hot, sulfuric, acid, and, hot, alkaline, solutions, also, cause, tantalum, to, corrode, this, property, makes, it, a, useful, metal, for, chemical, reaction, vessels, and, pipes, for, corrosive, liquids, heat, exchanging, coils, for, the, steam, heating, of, hydrochloric, acid, are, made, from, tantalum, tantalum, was, extensively, used, in, the, production, of, ultra, high, frequency, electron, tubes, for, radio, transmitters, tantalum, is, capable, of, capturing, oxygen, and, nitrogen, by, forming, nitrides, and, oxides, and, therefore, helped, to, sustain, the, high, vacuum, needed, for, the, tubes, when, used, for, internal, parts, such, as, grids, and, plates, tantalum, was, used, by, nasa, to, shield, components, of, spacecraft, such, as, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, from, radiation, the, high, melting, point, and, oxidation, resistance, led, to, the, use, of, the, metal, in, the, production, of, vacuum, furnace, parts, tantalum, is, extremely, inert, and, is, therefore, formed, into, a, variety, of, corrosion, resistant, parts, such, as, thermowells, valve, bodies, and, tantalum, fasteners, due, to, its, high, density, shaped, charge, and, explosively, formed, penetrator, liners, have, been, constructed, from, tantalum, tantalum, greatly, increases, the, armor, penetration, capabilities, of, a, shaped, charge, due, to, its, high, density, and, high, melting, point, it, is, also, occasionally, used, in, precious, watches, e, g, from, audemars, piguet, f, p, journe, hublot, montblanc, omega, and, panerai, medical, researcher, gerald, l, burke, first, observed, in, 1940, that, tantalum, is, also, highly, bio, inert, and, could, be, used, safely, as, an, orthopedic, implant, material, the, high, stiffness, of, tantalum, makes, it, necessary, to, use, it, as, highly, porous, foam, or, scaffold, with, lower, stiffness, for, hip, replacement, implants, to, avoid, stress, shielding, because, tantalum, is, a, non, ferrous, non, magnetic, metal, these, implants, are, considered, to, be, acceptable, for, patients, undergoing, mri, procedures, the, oxide, is, used, to, make, special, high, refractive, index, glass, for, camera, lenses, tantalum, receives, far, less, attention, in, the, environmental, field, than, it, does, in, other, geosciences, upper, crust, concentration, ucc, and, the, nb, ta, ratio, in, the, upper, crust, and, in, minerals, are, available, because, these, measurements, are, useful, as, a, geochemical, tool, the, latest, value, for, upper, crust, concentration, is, 0, 92, ppm, and, the, nb, ta, w, w, ratio, stands, at, 12, 7, little, data, is, available, on, tantalum, concentrations, in, the, different, environmental, compartments, especially, in, natural, waters, where, reliable, estimates, of, dissolved, tantalum, concentrations, in, seawater, and, freshwaters, have, not, even, been, produced, some, values, on, dissolved, concentrations, in, oceans, have, been, published, but, they, are, contradictory, values, in, freshwaters, fare, little, better, but, in, all, cases, they, are, probably, below, 1, ng, l, 1, since, dissolved, concentrations, in, natural, waters, are, well, below, most, current, analytical, capabilities, analysis, requires, pre, concentration, procedures, that, for, the, moment, do, not, give, consistent, results, and, in, any, case, tantalum, appears, to, be, present, in, natural, waters, mostly, as, particulate, matter, rather, than, dissolved, values, for, concentrations, in, soils, bed, sediments, and, atmospheric, aerosols, are, easier, to, come, by, values, in, soils, are, close, to, 1, ppm, and, thus, to, ucc, values, this, indicates, detrital, origin, for, atmospheric, aerosols, the, values, available, are, scattered, and, limited, when, tantalum, enrichment, is, observed, it, is, probably, due, to, loss, of, more, water, soluble, elements,
