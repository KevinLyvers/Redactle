the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, is, the, theory, describing, three, of, the, four, known, fundamental, forces, electromagnetic, weak, and, strong, interactions, excluding, gravity, in, the, universe, and, classifying, all, known, elementary, particles, it, was, developed, in, stages, throughout, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, through, the, work, of, many, scientists, worldwide, with, the, current, formulation, being, finalized, in, the, mid, 1970s, upon, experimental, confirmation, of, the, existence, of, quarks, since, then, proof, of, the, top, quark, 1995, the, tau, neutrino, 2000, and, the, higgs, boson, 2012, have, added, further, credence, to, the, standard, model, in, addition, the, standard, model, has, predicted, various, properties, of, weak, neutral, currents, and, the, w, and, z, bosons, with, great, accuracy, although, the, standard, model, is, believed, to, be, theoretically, self, consistent, and, has, demonstrated, some, success, in, providing, experimental, predictions, it, leaves, some, physical, phenomena, unexplained, and, so, falls, short, of, being, a, complete, theory, of, fundamental, interactions, for, example, it, does, not, fully, explain, baryon, asymmetry, incorporate, the, full, theory, of, gravitation, as, described, by, general, relativity, or, account, for, the, universe, s, accelerating, expansion, as, possibly, described, by, dark, energy, the, model, does, not, contain, any, viable, dark, matter, particle, that, possesses, all, of, the, required, properties, deduced, from, observational, cosmology, it, also, does, not, incorporate, neutrino, oscillations, and, their, non, zero, masses, the, development, of, the, standard, model, was, driven, by, theoretical, and, experimental, particle, physicists, alike, the, standard, model, is, a, paradigm, of, a, quantum, field, theory, for, theorists, exhibiting, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, including, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, anomalies, and, non, perturbative, behavior, it, is, used, as, a, basis, for, building, more, exotic, models, that, incorporate, hypothetical, particles, extra, dimensions, and, elaborate, symmetries, such, as, supersymmetry, to, explain, experimental, results, at, variance, with, the, standard, model, such, as, the, existence, of, dark, matter, and, neutrino, oscillations, in, 1954, yang, chen, ning, and, robert, mills, extended, the, concept, of, gauge, theory, for, abelian, groups, e, g, quantum, electrodynamics, to, nonabelian, groups, to, provide, an, explanation, for, strong, interactions, in, 1957, chien, shiung, wu, demonstrated, parity, was, not, conserved, in, the, weak, interaction, in, 1961, sheldon, glashow, combined, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, in, 1967, steven, weinberg, and, abdus, salam, incorporated, the, higgs, mechanism, into, glashow, s, electroweak, interaction, giving, it, its, modern, form, the, higgs, mechanism, is, believed, to, give, rise, to, the, masses, of, all, the, elementary, particles, in, the, standard, model, this, includes, the, masses, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, and, the, masses, of, the, fermions, i, e, the, quarks, and, leptons, after, the, neutral, weak, currents, caused, by, z, boson, exchange, were, discovered, at, cern, in, 1973, the, electroweak, theory, became, widely, accepted, and, glashow, salam, and, weinberg, shared, the, 1979, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, discovering, it, the, w, and, z, 0, bosons, were, discovered, experimentally, in, 1983, and, the, ratio, of, their, masses, was, found, to, be, as, the, standard, model, predicted, the, theory, of, the, strong, interaction, i, e, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, to, which, many, contributed, acquired, its, modern, form, in, 1973, 74, when, asymptotic, freedom, was, proposed, a, development, which, made, qcd, the, main, focus, of, theoretical, research, and, experiments, confirmed, that, the, hadrons, were, composed, of, fractionally, charged, quarks, the, term, standard, model, was, introduced, by, abraham, pais, and, sam, treiman, in, 1975, with, reference, to, the, electroweak, theory, with, four, quarks, steven, weinberg, has, since, claimed, priority, explaining, that, he, chose, the, term, standard, model, out, of, a, sense, of, modesty, and, used, it, in, 1973, during, a, talk, in, aix, en, provence, in, france, the, standard, model, includes, members, of, several, classes, of, elementary, particles, which, in, turn, can, be, distinguished, by, other, characteristics, such, as, color, charge, all, particles, can, be, summarized, as, follows, notes, an, anti, electron, e, is, conventionally, called, a, positron, the, standard, model, includes, 12, elementary, particles, of, spin, 1, 2, known, as, fermions, fermions, respect, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, meaning, that, two, identical, fermions, cannot, simultaneously, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, in, the, same, atom, each, fermion, has, a, corresponding, antiparticle, which, are, particles, that, have, corresponding, properties, with, the, exception, of, opposite, charges, fermions, are, classified, based, on, how, they, interact, which, is, determined, by, the, charges, they, carry, into, two, groups, quarks, and, leptons, within, each, group, pairs, of, particles, that, exhibit, similar, physical, behaviors, are, then, grouped, into, generations, see, the, table, each, member, of, a, generation, has, a, greater, mass, than, the, corresponding, particle, of, generations, prior, thus, there, are, three, generations, of, quarks, and, leptons, as, first, generation, particles, do, not, decay, they, comprise, all, of, ordinary, baryonic, matter, specifically, all, atoms, consist, of, electrons, orbiting, around, the, atomic, nucleus, ultimately, constituted, of, up, and, down, quarks, on, the, other, hand, second, and, third, generation, charged, particles, decay, with, very, short, half, lives, and, can, only, be, observed, in, high, energy, environments, neutrinos, of, all, generations, also, do, not, decay, and, pervade, the, universe, but, rarely, interact, with, baryonic, matter, there, are, six, quarks, up, down, charm, strange, top, and, bottom, quarks, carry, color, charge, and, hence, interact, via, the, strong, interaction, the, color, confinement, phenomenon, results, in, quarks, being, strongly, bound, together, such, that, they, form, color, neutral, composite, particles, called, hadrons, quarks, cannot, individually, exist, and, must, always, bind, with, other, quarks, hadrons, can, contain, either, a, quark, antiquark, pair, mesons, or, three, quarks, baryons, the, lightest, baryons, are, the, nucleons, the, proton, and, neutron, quarks, also, carry, electric, charge, and, weak, isospin, and, thus, interact, with, other, fermions, through, electromagnetism, and, weak, interaction, the, six, leptons, consist, of, the, electron, electron, neutrino, muon, muon, neutrino, tau, and, tau, neutrino, the, leptons, do, not, carry, color, charge, and, do, not, respond, to, strong, interaction, the, main, leptons, carry, an, electric, charge, of, 1, e, while, the, three, neutrinos, carry, a, neutral, electric, charge, thus, the, neutrinos, motion, are, only, influenced, by, weak, interaction, and, gravity, making, them, difficult, to, observe, the, standard, model, includes, 4, kinds, of, gauge, bosons, of, spin, 1, with, bosons, being, quantum, particles, containing, an, integer, spin, the, gauge, bosons, are, defined, as, force, carriers, as, they, are, responsible, for, mediating, the, fundamental, interactions, the, standard, model, explains, the, four, fundamental, forces, as, arising, from, the, interactions, with, fermions, exchanging, virtual, force, carrier, particles, thus, mediating, the, forces, at, a, macroscopic, scale, this, manifests, as, a, force, as, a, result, they, do, not, follow, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, that, constrains, fermions, bosons, do, not, have, a, theoretical, limit, on, their, spatial, density, the, types, of, gauge, bosons, are, described, below, the, feynman, diagram, calculations, which, are, a, graphical, representation, of, the, perturbation, theory, approximation, invoke, force, mediating, particles, and, when, applied, to, analyze, high, energy, scattering, experiments, are, in, reasonable, agreement, with, the, data, however, perturbation, theory, and, with, it, the, concept, of, a, force, mediating, particle, fails, in, other, situations, these, include, low, energy, quantum, chromodynamics, bound, states, and, solitons, the, interactions, between, all, the, particles, described, by, the, standard, model, are, summarized, by, the, diagrams, on, the, right, of, this, section, the, higgs, particle, is, a, massive, scalar, elementary, particle, theorized, by, peter, higgs, and, others, in, 1964, when, he, showed, that, goldstone, s, 1962, theorem, generic, continuous, symmetry, which, is, spontaneously, broken, provides, a, third, polarisation, of, a, massive, vector, field, hence, goldstone, s, original, scalar, doublet, the, massive, spin, zero, particle, was, proposed, as, the, higgs, boson, and, is, a, key, building, block, in, the, standard, model, it, has, no, intrinsic, spin, and, for, that, reason, is, classified, as, a, boson, with, spin, 0, the, higgs, boson, plays, a, unique, role, in, the, standard, model, by, explaining, why, the, other, elementary, particles, except, the, photon, and, gluon, are, massive, in, particular, the, higgs, boson, explains, why, the, photon, has, no, mass, while, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, very, heavy, elementary, particle, masses, and, the, differences, between, electromagnetism, mediated, by, the, photon, and, the, weak, force, mediated, by, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, critical, to, many, aspects, of, the, structure, of, microscopic, and, hence, macroscopic, matter, in, electroweak, theory, the, higgs, boson, generates, the, masses, of, the, leptons, electron, muon, and, tau, and, quarks, as, the, higgs, boson, is, massive, it, must, interact, with, itself, because, the, higgs, boson, is, a, very, massive, particle, and, also, decays, almost, immediately, when, created, only, a, very, high, energy, particle, accelerator, can, observe, and, record, it, experiments, to, confirm, and, determine, the, nature, of, the, higgs, boson, using, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, at, cern, began, in, early, 2010, and, were, performed, at, fermilab, s, tevatron, until, its, closure, in, late, 2011, mathematical, consistency, of, the, standard, model, requires, that, any, mechanism, capable, of, generating, the, masses, of, elementary, particles, must, become, visible, at, energies, above, 1, 4, tev, therefore, the, lhc, designed, to, collide, two, 7, tev, proton, beams, was, built, to, answer, the, question, of, whether, the, higgs, boson, actually, exists, on, 4, july, 2012, two, of, the, experiments, at, the, lhc, atlas, and, cms, both, reported, independently, that, they, had, found, a, new, particle, with, a, mass, of, about, 125, gev, c, 2, about, 133, proton, masses, on, the, order, of, 10, 25, kg, which, is, consistent, with, the, higgs, boson, on, 13, march, 2013, it, was, confirmed, to, be, the, searched, for, higgs, boson, technically, quantum, field, theory, provides, the, mathematical, framework, for, the, standard, model, in, which, a, lagrangian, controls, the, dynamics, and, kinematics, of, the, theory, each, kind, of, particle, is, described, in, terms, of, a, dynamical, field, that, pervades, space, time, the, construction, of, the, standard, model, proceeds, following, the, modern, method, of, constructing, most, field, theories, by, first, postulating, a, set, of, symmetries, of, the, system, and, then, by, writing, down, the, most, general, renormalizable, lagrangian, from, its, particle, field, content, that, observes, these, symmetries, the, global, poincar, symmetry, is, postulated, for, all, relativistic, quantum, field, theories, it, consists, of, the, familiar, translational, symmetry, rotational, symmetry, and, the, inertial, reference, frame, invariance, central, to, the, theory, of, special, relativity, the, local, su, 3, su, 2, u, 1, gauge, symmetry, is, an, internal, symmetry, that, essentially, defines, the, standard, model, roughly, the, three, factors, of, the, gauge, symmetry, give, rise, to, the, three, fundamental, interactions, the, fields, fall, into, different, representations, of, the, various, symmetry, groups, of, the, standard, model, see, table, upon, writing, the, most, general, lagrangian, one, finds, that, the, dynamics, depends, on, 19, parameters, whose, numerical, values, are, established, by, experiment, the, parameters, are, summarized, in, the, table, made, visible, by, clicking, show,

standard, model, such, an, interaction, is, described, as, an, exchange, of, bosons, between, the, objects, affected, such, as, a, photon, for, the, electromagnetic, force, and, a, gluon, for, the, strong, interaction, those, particles, are, called, force, carriers, or, messenger, particles, despite, being, perhaps, the, most, familiar, fundamental, interaction, gravity, is, not, described, by, the, standard, model, due, to, contradictions, that, arise, when, combining, general, relativity, the, modern, theory, of, gravity, and, quantum, mechanics, however, gravity, is, so, weak, at, microscopic, scales, that, it, is, essentially, unmeasurable, the, graviton, is, postulated, to, be, the, mediating, particle, but, has, not, yet, been, proved, to, exist, electromagnetism, is, the, only, long, range, force, in, the, standard, model, it, is, mediated, by, photons, and, couples, to, electric, charge, electromagnetism, is, responsible, for, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, including, atomic, electron, shell, structure, chemical, bonds, electric, circuits, and, electronics, electromagnetic, interactions, in, the, standard, model, are, described, by, quantum, electrodynamics, the, weak, interaction, is, responsible, for, various, forms, of, particle, decay, such, as, beta, decay, it, is, weak, and, short, range, due, to, the, fact, that, the, weak, mediating, particles, w, and, z, bosons, have, mass, w, bosons, have, electric, charge, and, mediate, interactions, that, change, the, particle, type, referred, to, as, flavour, and, charge, interactions, mediated, by, w, bosons, are, charged, current, interactions, z, bosons, are, neutral, and, mediate, neutral, current, interactions, which, do, not, change, particle, flavour, thus, z, bosons, are, similar, to, the, photon, aside, from, them, being, massive, and, interacting, with, the, neutrino, the, weak, interaction, is, also, the, only, interaction, to, violate, parity, and, cp, parity, violation, is, maximal, for, charged, current, interactions, since, the, w, boson, interacts, exclusively, with, left, handed, fermions, and, right, handed, antifermions, in, the, standard, model, the, weak, force, is, understood, in, terms, of, the, electroweak, theory, which, states, that, the, weak, and, electromagnetic, interactions, become, united, into, a, single, electroweak, interaction, at, high, energies, the, strong, nuclear, force, is, responsible, for, hadronic, and, nuclear, binding, it, is, mediated, by, gluons, which, couple, to, color, charge, since, gluons, themselves, have, color, charge, the, strong, force, exhibits, confinement, and, asymptotic, freedom, confinement, means, that, only, color, neutral, particles, can, exist, in, isolation, therefore, quarks, can, only, exist, in, hadrons, and, never, in, isolation, at, low, energies, asymptotic, freedom, means, that, the, strong, force, becomes, weaker, as, the, energy, scale, increases, the, strong, force, overpowers, the, electrostatic, repulsion, of, protons, and, quarks, in, nuclei, and, hadrons, respectively, at, their, respective, scales, while, quarks, are, bound, in, hadrons, by, the, fundamental, strong, interaction, which, is, mediated, by, gluons, nucleons, are, bound, by, an, emergent, phenomenon, termed, the, residual, strong, force, or, nuclear, force, this, interaction, is, mediated, by, mesons, such, as, the, pion, the, color, charges, inside, the, nucleon, cancel, out, meaning, most, of, the, gluon, and, quark, fields, cancel, out, outside, of, the, nucleon, however, some, residue, is, leaked, which, appears, as, the, exchange, of, virtual, mesons, that, causes, the, attractive, force, between, nucleons, the, fundamental, strong, interaction, is, described, by, quantum, chromodynamics, which, is, a, component, of, the, standard, model, the, standard, model, predicted, the, existence, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, gluon, top, quark, and, charm, quark, and, predicted, many, of, their, properties, before, these, particles, were, observed, the, predictions, were, experimentally, confirmed, with, good, precision, the, standard, model, also, predicted, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, which, was, found, in, 2012, at, the, large, hadron, collider, the, final, fundamental, particle, predicted, by, the, standard, model, to, be, experimentally, confirmed, self, consistency, of, the, standard, model, currently, formulated, as, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, quantized, through, path, integrals, has, not, been, mathematically, proved, while, regularized, versions, useful, for, approximate, computations, for, example, lattice, gauge, theory, exist, it, is, not, known, whether, they, converge, in, the, sense, of, s, matrix, elements, in, the, limit, that, the, regulator, is, removed, a, key, question, related, to, the, consistency, is, the, yang, mills, existence, and, mass, gap, problem, experiments, indicate, that, neutrinos, have, mass, which, the, classic, standard, model, did, not, allow, to, accommodate, this, finding, the, classic, standard, model, can, be, modified, to, include, neutrino, mass, although, it, is, not, obvious, exactly, how, this, should, be, done, if, one, insists, on, using, only, standard, model, particles, this, can, be, achieved, by, adding, a, non, renormalizable, interaction, of, leptons, with, the, higgs, boson, on, a, fundamental, level, such, an, interaction, emerges, in, the, seesaw, mechanism, where, heavy, right, handed, neutrinos, are, added, to, the, theory, this, is, natural, in, the, left, right, symmetric, extension, of, the, standard, model, and, in, certain, grand, unified, theories, as, long, as, new, physics, appears, below, or, around, 10, 14, gev, the, neutrino, masses, can, be, of, the, right, order, of, magnitude, theoretical, and, experimental, research, has, attempted, to, extend, the, standard, model, into, a, unified, field, theory, or, a, theory, of, everything, a, complete, theory, explaining, all, physical, phenomena, including, constants, inadequacies, of, the, standard, model, that, motivate, such, research, include, currently, no, proposed, theory, of, everything, has, been, widely, accepted, or, verified
