in, chemistry, and, manufacturing, electrolysis, is, a, technique, that, uses, direct, electric, current, dc, to, drive, an, otherwise, non, spontaneous, chemical, reaction, electrolysis, is, commercially, important, as, a, stage, in, the, separation, of, elements, from, naturally, occurring, sources, such, as, ores, using, an, electrolytic, cell, the, voltage, that, is, needed, for, electrolysis, to, occur, is, called, the, decomposition, potential, the, word, lysis, means, to, separate, or, break, so, in, terms, electrolysis, would, mean, breakdown, via, electricity, the, word, electrolysis, was, introduced, by, michael, faraday, in, 1834, using, the, greek, words, amber, which, since, the, 17th, century, was, associated, with, electrical, phenomena, and, meaning, dissolution, nevertheless, electrolysis, as, a, tool, to, study, chemical, reactions, and, obtain, pure, elements, precedes, the, coinage, of, the, term, and, formal, description, by, faraday, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, william, nicholson, and, anthony, carlisle, sought, to, further, volta, s, experiments, they, attached, two, wires, to, either, side, of, a, voltaic, pile, and, placed, the, other, ends, in, a, tube, filled, with, water, they, noticed, when, the, wires, were, brought, together, that, each, wire, produced, bubbles, one, type, was, hydrogen, the, other, was, oxygen, in, 1785, a, dutch, scientist, named, martin, van, marum, created, an, electrostatic, generator, that, he, used, to, reduce, tin, zinc, and, antimony, from, their, salts, using, a, process, later, known, as, electrolysis, though, he, unknowingly, produced, electrolysis, it, was, not, until, 1800, when, william, nicholson, and, anthony, carlisle, discovered, how, electrolysis, works, in, 1791, luigi, galvani, experimented, with, frog, legs, he, claimed, that, placing, animal, muscle, between, two, dissimilar, metal, sheets, resulted, in, electricity, responding, to, these, claims, alessandro, volta, conducted, his, own, tests, this, would, give, insight, to, humphry, davy, s, ideas, on, electrolysis, during, preliminary, experiments, humphry, davy, hypothesized, that, when, two, elements, combine, to, form, a, compound, electrical, energy, is, released, humphry, davy, would, go, on, to, create, decomposition, tables, from, his, preliminary, experiments, on, electrolysis, the, decomposition, tables, would, give, insight, on, the, energies, needed, to, break, apart, certain, compounds, in, 1817, johan, august, arfwedson, determined, there, was, another, element, lithium, in, some, of, his, samples, however, he, could, not, isolate, the, component, it, was, not, until, 1821, that, william, thomas, brande, used, electrolysis, to, single, it, out, two, years, later, he, streamlined, the, process, using, lithium, chloride, and, potassium, chloride, with, electrolysis, to, produce, lithium, and, lithium, hydroxide, during, the, later, years, of, humphry, davy, s, research, michael, faraday, became, his, assistant, while, studying, the, process, of, electrolysis, under, humphry, davy, michael, faraday, discovered, two, laws, of, electrolysis, during, the, time, of, maxwell, and, faraday, concerns, came, about, for, electropositive, and, electronegative, activities, in, november, 1875, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, discovered, gallium, using, electrolysis, of, gallium, hydroxide, producing, 3, 4, mg, of, gallium, the, following, december, he, presented, his, discovery, of, gallium, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, paris, on, june, 26, 1886, ferdinand, frederick, henri, moissan, finally, felt, comfortable, performing, electrolysis, on, anhydrous, hydrogen, fluoride, to, create, a, gaseous, fluorine, pure, element, before, he, used, hydrogen, fluoride, henri, moissan, used, fluoride, salts, with, electrolysis, thus, on, june, 28, 1886, he, performed, his, experiment, in, front, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, to, show, his, discovery, of, the, new, element, fluorine, while, trying, to, find, elemental, fluorine, through, electrolysis, of, fluoride, salts, many, chemists, perished, including, paulin, louyet, and, j, r, me, nickl, s, in, 1886, charles, martin, hall, from, america, and, paul, h, roult, from, france, both, filed, for, american, patents, for, the, electrolysis, of, aluminum, with, h, roult, submitting, his, in, may, and, hall, in, july, hall, was, able, to, get, his, patent, by, proving, through, letters, to, his, brother, and, family, evidence, that, his, method, was, discovered, before, the, french, patent, was, submitted, this, became, known, as, the, hall, h, roult, process, which, benefited, many, industries, because, aluminum, s, price, then, dropped, from, four, dollars, to, thirty, cents, per, pound, in, 1902, polish, engineer, and, inventor, stanis, aw, aszczy, ski, filed, for, and, obtained, polish, patent, for, the, electrolysis, of, copper, and, zinc, electrolysis, is, the, passing, of, a, direct, electric, current, through, an, electrolyte, which, is, producing, chemical, reactions, at, the, electrodes, and, decomposition, of, the, materials, the, main, components, required, to, achieve, electrolysis, are, an, electrolyte, electrodes, and, an, external, power, source, a, partition, e, g, an, ion, exchange, membrane, or, a, salt, bridge, is, optional, to, keep, the, products, from, diffusing, to, the, vicinity, of, the, opposite, electrode, the, electrolyte, is, a, chemical, substance, which, contains, free, ions, and, carries, electric, current, e, g, an, ion, conducting, polymer, solution, or, a, ionic, liquid, compound, if, the, ions, are, not, mobile, as, in, most, solid, salts, then, electrolysis, cannot, occur, a, liquid, electrolyte, is, produced, by, the, electrodes, are, immersed, separated, by, a, distance, such, that, a, current, flows, between, them, through, the, electrolyte, and, are, connected, to, the, power, source, which, completes, the, electrical, circuit, a, direct, current, supplied, by, the, power, source, drives, the, reaction, causing, ions, in, the, electrolyte, to, be, attracted, toward, the, respective, oppositely, charged, electrode, electrodes, of, metal, graphite, and, semiconductor, material, are, widely, used, choice, of, suitable, electrode, depends, on, chemical, reactivity, between, the, electrode, and, electrolyte, and, manufacturing, cost, historically, when, non, reactive, anodes, were, desired, for, electrolysis, graphite, called, plumbago, in, faraday, s, time, or, platinum, were, chosen, they, were, found, to, be, some, of, the, least, reactive, materials, for, anodes, platinum, erodes, very, slowly, compared, to, other, materials, and, graphite, crumbles, and, can, produce, carbon, dioxide, in, aqueous, solutions, but, otherwise, does, not, participate, in, the, reaction, cathodes, may, be, made, of, the, same, material, or, they, may, be, made, from, a, more, reactive, one, since, anode, wear, is, greater, due, to, oxidation, at, the, anode, the, key, process, of, electrolysis, is, the, interchange, of, atoms, and, ions, by, the, removal, or, addition, of, electrons, due, to, the, applied, potential, the, desired, products, of, electrolysis, are, often, in, a, different, physical, state, from, the, electrolyte, and, can, be, removed, by, mechanical, processes, e, g, by, collecting, gas, above, an, electrode, or, precipitating, a, product, out, of, the, electrolyte, the, quantity, of, the, products, is, proportional, to, the, current, and, when, two, or, more, electrolytic, cells, are, connected, in, series, to, the, same, power, source, the, products, produced, in, the, cells, are, proportional, to, their, equivalent, weight, these, are, known, as, faraday, s, laws, of, electrolysis, each, electrode, attracts, ions, that, are, of, the, opposite, charge, positively, charged, ions, cations, move, towards, the, electron, providing, negative, cathode, negatively, charged, ions, anions, move, towards, the, electron, extracting, positive, anode, in, this, process, electrons, are, effectively, introduced, at, the, cathode, as, a, reactant, and, removed, at, the, anode, as, a, product, in, chemistry, the, loss, of, electrons, is, called, oxidation, while, electron, gain, is, called, reduction, when, neutral, atoms, or, molecules, such, as, those, on, the, surface, of, an, electrode, gain, or, lose, electrons, they, become, ions, and, may, dissolve, in, the, electrolyte, and, react, with, other, ions, when, ions, gain, or, lose, electrons, and, become, neutral, they, will, form, compounds, that, separate, from, the, electrolyte, positive, metal, ions, like, cu, 2, deposit, onto, the, cathode, in, a, layer, the, terms, for, this, are, electroplating, electrowinning, and, electrorefining, when, an, ion, gains, or, loses, electrons, without, becoming, neutral, its, electronic, charge, is, altered, in, the, process, for, example, the, electrolysis, of, brine, produces, hydrogen, and, chlorine, gases, which, bubble, from, the, electrolyte, and, are, collected, the, initial, overall, reaction, is, thus, the, reaction, at, the, anode, results, in, chlorine, gas, from, chlorine, ions, the, reaction, at, the, cathode, results, in, hydrogen, gas, and, hydroxide, ions, without, a, partition, between, the, electrodes, the, oh, ions, produced, at, the, cathode, are, free, to, diffuse, throughout, the, electrolyte, to, the, anode, as, the, electrolyte, becomes, more, basic, due, to, the, production, of, oh, less, cl, 2, emerges, from, the, solution, as, it, begins, to, react, with, the, hydroxide, producing, hypochlorite, clo, at, the, anode, the, more, opportunity, the, cl, 2, has, to, interact, with, naoh, in, the, solution, the, less, cl, 2, emerges, at, the, surface, of, the, solution, and, the, faster, the, production, of, hypochlorite, progresses, this, depends, on, factors, such, as, solution, temperature, the, amount, of, time, the, cl, 2, molecule, is, in, contact, with, the, solution, and, concentration, of, naoh, likewise, as, hypochlorite, increases, in, concentration, chlorates, are, produced, from, them, other, reactions, occur, such, as, the, self, ionization, of, water, and, the, decomposition, of, hypochlorite, at, the, cathode, the, rate, of, the, latter, depends, on, factors, such, as, diffusion, and, the, surface, area, of, the, cathode, in, contact, with, the, electrolyte, decomposition, potential, or, decomposition, voltage, refers, to, the, minimum, voltage, difference, in, electrode, potential, between, anode, and, cathode, of, an, electrolytic, cell, that, is, needed, for, electrolysis, to, occur, the, voltage, at, which, electrolysis, is, thermodynamically, preferred, is, the, difference, of, the, electrode, potentials, as, calculated, using, the, nernst, equation, applying, additional, voltage, referred, to, as, overpotential, can, increase, the, rate, of, reaction, and, is, often, needed, above, the, thermodynamic, value, it, is, especially, necessary, for, electrolysis, reactions, involving, gases, such, as, oxygen, hydrogen, or, chlorine, oxidation, of, ions, or, neutral, molecules, occurs, at, the, anode, for, example, it, is, possible, to, oxidize, ferrous, ions, to, ferric, ions, at, the, anode, reduction, of, ions, or, neutral, molecules, occurs, at, the, cathode, it, is, possible, to, reduce, ferricyanide, ions, to, ferrocyanide, ions, at, the, cathode, neutral, molecules, can, also, react, at, either, of, the, electrodes, for, example, p, benzoquinone, can, be, reduced, to, hydroquinone, at, the, cathode, in, the, last, example, h, ions, hydrogen, ions, also, take, part, in, the, reaction, and, are, provided, by, the, acid, in, the, solution, or, by, the, solvent, itself, water, methanol, etc, electrolysis, reactions, involving, h, ions, are, fairly, common, in, acidic, solutions, in, aqueous, alkaline, solutions, reactions, involving, oh, hydroxide, ions, are, common, sometimes, the, solvents, themselves, usually, water, are, oxidized, or, reduced, at, the, electrodes, it, is, even, possible, to, have, electrolysis, involving, gases, e, g, by, using, a, gas, diffusion, electrode, the, amount, of, electrical, energy, that, must, be, added, equals, the, change, in, gibbs, free, energy, of, the, reaction, plus, the, losses, in, the, system, the, losses, can, in, theory, be, arbitrarily, close, to, zero, so, the, maximum, thermodynamic, efficiency, equals, the, enthalpy, change, divided, by, the, free, energy, change, of, the, reaction, in, most, cases, the, electric, input, is, larger, than, the, enthalpy, change, of, the, reaction, so, some, energy, is, released, in, the, form, of, heat, in, some, cases, for, instance, in, the, electrolysis, of, steam, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, at, high, temperature, the, opposite, is, true, and, heat, energy, is, absorbed, this, heat, is, absorbed, from, the, surroundings, and, the, heating, value, of, the, produced, hydrogen, is, higher, than, the, electric, input, pulsating, current, results, in, products, different, from, dc, for, example, pulsing, increases, the, ratio, of, ozone, to, oxygen, produced, at, the, anode, in, the, electrolysis, of, an, aqueous, acidic, solution, such, as, dilute, sulphuric, acid, electrolysis, of, ethanol, with, pulsed, current, evolves, an, aldehyde, instead, of, primarily, an, acid, galvanic, cells, and, batteries, use, spontaneous, energy, releasing, redox, reactions, to, generate, an, electrical, potential, that, provides, useful, power, when, a, secondary, battery, is, charged, its, redox, reaction, is, run, in, reverse, and, the, system, can, be, considered, as, an, electrolytic, cell, in, manufacturing, electrolysis, can, be, used, for, using, a, cell, containing, inert, platinum, electrodes, electrolysis, of, aqueous, solutions, of, some, salts, leads, to, the, reduction, of, the, cations, such, as, metal, deposition, with, for, example, zinc, salts, and, oxidation, of, the, anions, such, as, the, evolution, of, bromine, with, bromides, however, with, salts, of, some, metals, such, as, sodium, hydrogen, is, evolved, at, the, cathode, and, for, salts, containing, some, anions, such, as, sulfate, so, 2, 4, oxygen, is, evolved, at, the, anode, in, both, cases, this, is, due, to, water, being, reduced, to, form, hydrogen, or, oxidized, to, form, oxygen, in, principle, the, voltage, required, to, electrolyze, a, salt, solution, can, be, derived, from, the, standard, electrode, potential, for, the, reactions, at, the, anode, and, cathode, the, standard, electrode, potential, is, directly, related, to, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, for, the, reactions, at, each, electrode, and, refers, to, an, electrode, with, no, current, flowing, an, extract, from, the, table, of, standard, electrode, potentials, is, shown, below, in, terms, of, electrolysis, this, table, should, be, interpreted, as, follows, using, the, nernst, equation, the, electrode, potential, can, be, calculated, for, a, specific, concentration, of, ions, temperature, and, the, number, of, electrons, involved, for, pure, water, ph, 7, comparable, figures, calculated, in, a, similar, way, for, 1, m, zinc, bromide, znbr, 2, are, 0, 76, v, for, the, reduction, to, zn, metal, and, 1, 10, v, for, the, oxidation, producing, bromine, the, conclusion, from, these, figures, is, that, hydrogen, should, be, produced, at, the, cathode, and, oxygen, at, the, anode, from, the, electrolysis, of, water, which, is, at, variance, with, the, experimental, observation, that, zinc, metal, is, deposited, and, bromine, is, produced, the, explanation, is, that, these, calculated, potentials, only, indicate, the, thermodynamically, preferred, reaction, in, practice, many, other, factors, have, to, be, taken, into, account, such, as, the, kinetics, of, some, of, the, reaction, steps, involved, these, factors, together, mean, that, a, higher, potential, is, required, for, the, reduction, and, oxidation, of, water, than, predicted, and, these, are, termed, overpotentials, experimentally, it, is, known, that, overpotentials, depend, on, the, design, of, the, cell, and, the, nature, of, the, electrodes, for, the, electrolysis, of, a, neutral, ph, 7, sodium, chloride, solution, the, reduction, of, sodium, ion, is, thermodynamically, very, difficult, and, water, is, reduced, evolving, hydrogen, leaving, hydroxide, ions, in, solution, at, the, anode, the, oxidation, of, chlorine, is, observed, rather, than, the, oxidation, of, water, since, the, overpotential, for, the, oxidation, of, chloride, to, chlorine, is, lower, than, the, overpotential, for, the, oxidation, of, water, to, oxygen, the, hydroxide, ions, and, dissolved, chlorine, gas, react, further, to, form, hypochlorous, acid, the, aqueous, solutions, resulting, from, this, process, is, called, electrolyzed, water, and, is, used, as, a, disinfectant, and, cleaning, agent, the, electrochemical, reduction, or, electrocatalytic, conversion, of, co, 2, can, produce, value, added, chemicals, such, methane, ethylene, ethanol, etc, the, electrolysis, of, carbon, dioxide, gives, formate, or, carbon, monoxide, but, sometimes, more, elaborate, organic, compounds, such, as, ethylene, this, technology, is, under, research, as, a, carbon, neutral, route, to, organic, compounds, electrolysis, of, water, produces, hydrogen, and, oxygen, in, a, ratio, of, 2, to, 1, respectively, the, energy, efficiency, of, water, electrolysis, varies, widely, the, efficiency, of, an, electrolyser, is, a, measure, of, the, enthalpy, contained, in, the, hydrogen, to, undergo, combustion, with, oxygen, or, some, other, later, reaction, compared, with, the, input, electrical, energy, heat, enthalpy, values, for, hydrogen, are, well, published, in, science, and, engineering, texts, as, 144, mj, kg, 40, kwh, kg, note, that, fuel, cells, not, electrolysers, cannot, use, this, full, amount, of, heat, enthalpy, which, has, led, to, some, confusion, when, calculating, efficiency, values, for, both, types, of, technology, in, the, reaction, some, energy, is, lost, as, heat, some, reports, quote, efficiencies, between, 50, and, 70, for, alkaline, electrolysers, 50, kwh, kg, however, higher, practical, efficiencies, are, available, with, the, use, of, polymer, electrolyte, membrane, electrolysis, and, catalytic, technology, such, as, 95, efficiency, the, national, renewable, energy, laboratory, estimated, in, 2006, that, 1, kg, of, hydrogen, roughly, equivalent, to, 3, kg, or, 4, liters, of, petroleum, in, energy, terms, could, be, produced, by, wind, powered, electrolysis, for, between, us, 5, 55, in, the, near, term, and, us, 2, 27, in, the, longer, term, about, 4, of, hydrogen, gas, produced, worldwide, is, generated, by, electrolysis, and, normally, used, onsite, hydrogen, is, used, for, the, creation, of, ammonia, for, fertilizer, via, the, haber, process, and, converting, heavy, petroleum, sources, to, lighter, fractions, via, hydrocracking, onsite, electrolysis, has, been, utilized, to, capture, hydrogen, for, hydrogen, fuel, cells, in, hydrogen, vehicles, recently, to, reduce, the, energy, input, the, utilization, of, carbon, coal, alcohols, hydrocarbon, solution, and, organic, solution, glycerol, formic, acid, ethylene, glycol, etc, with, co, electrolysis, of, water, has, been, proposed, as, a, viable, option, the, carbon, hydrocarbon, assisted, water, electrolysis, so, called, cawe, process, for, hydrogen, generation, would, perform, this, operation, in, a, single, electrochemical, reactor, this, system, energy, balance, can, be, required, only, around, 40, electric, input, with, 60, coming, from, the, chemical, energy, of, carbon, or, hydrocarbon, this, process, utilizes, solid, coal, carbon, particles, or, powder, as, fuels, dispersed, in, acid, alkaline, electrolyte, in, the, form, of, slurry, and, the, carbon, contained, source, co, assist, in, the, electrolysis, process, as, following, theoretical, overall, reactions, or, thus, this, cawe, approach, is, that, the, actual, cell, overpotential, can, be, significantly, reduced, to, below, 1, 0, v, as, compared, to, 1, 5, v, for, conventional, water, electrolysis, a, specialized, application, of, electrolysis, involves, the, growth, of, conductive, crystals, on, one, of, the, electrodes, from, oxidized, or, reduced, species, that, are, generated, in, situ, the, technique, has, been, used, to, obtain, single, crystals, of, low, dimensional, electrical, conductors, such, as, charge, transfer, salts, and, linear, chain, compounds, the, current, method, of, producing, steel, from, iron, ore, is, very, carbon, intensive, in, part, to, the, direct, release, of, co, 2, in, the, blast, furnace, a, study, of, steel, making, in, germany, found, that, producing, 1, ton, of, steel, emitted, 2, 1, tons, of, co, 2, e, with, 22, of, that, being, direct, emissions, from, the, blast, furnace, as, of, 2022, steel, production, contributes, 7, 9, of, global, emissions, electrolysis, of, iron, can, eliminate, direct, emissions, and, further, reduce, emissions, if, the, electricity, is, created, from, green, energy, the, small, scale, electrolysis, of, iron, has, been, successfully, reported, by, dissolving, it, in, molten, oxide, salts, and, using, a, platinum, anode, oxygen, anions, form, oxygen, gas, and, electrons, at, the, anode, iron, cations, consume, electrons, and, form, iron, metal, at, the, cathode, this, method, was, performed, a, temperature, of, 1550, c, which, presents, a, significant, challenge, to, maintaining, the, reaction, particularly, anode, corrosion, is, a, concern, at, these, temperatures, additionally, the, low, temperature, reduction, of, iron, oxide, by, dissolving, it, in, alkaline, water, has, been, reported, the, temperature, is, much, lower, than, traditional, iron, production, at, 114, c, the, low, temperatures, also, tend, to, correlate, with, higher, current, efficiencies, with, an, efficiency, of, 95, being, reported, while, these, methods, are, promising, they, struggle, to, be, cost, competitive, because, of, the, large, economies, of, scale, keeping, the, price, of, blast, furnace, iron, low, a, 2020, study, investigated, direct, electrolysis, of, seawater, alkaline, electrolysis, proton, exchange, membrane, electrolysis, and, solid, oxide, electrolysis, direct, electrolysis, of, seawater, follows, known, processes, forming, an, electrolysis, cell, in, which, the, seawater, acts, as, the, electrolyte, to, allow, for, the, reaction, at, the, anode, 2, cl, aq, cl, 2, g, 2e, and, the, reaction, at, the, cathode, 2, h, 2, o, l, 2, e, h, 2, g, 2oh, aq, the, inclusion, of, magnesium, and, calcium, ions, in, the, seawater, makes, the, production, of, alkali, hydroxides, possible, that, could, form, scales, in, the, electrolyser, cell, cutting, down, on, lifespan, and, increasing, the, need, for, maintenance, the, alkaline, electrolysers, operate, with, the, following, reactions, at, the, anode, 2, oh, aq, 1, 2, o, 2, g, h, 2, o, l, 2, e, and, cathode, 2, h, 2, o, l, 2, e, h, 2, g, 2, oh, aq, and, use, high, base, solutions, as, electrolytes, operating, at, 60, 90, c, 140, 194, f, and, need, additional, separators, to, ensure, the, gas, phase, hydrogen, and, oxygen, remain, separate, the, electrolyte, can, easily, get, contaminated, but, the, alkaline, electrolyser, can, operate, under, pressure, to, improve, energy, consumption, the, electrodes, can, be, made, of, inexpensive, materials, and, there, s, no, requirement, for, an, expensive, catalyst, in, the, design, proton, exchange, membrane, electrolysers, operate, with, the, reactions, at, the, anode, h, 2, o, l, 1, 2, o, 2, g, 2, h, aq, 2, e, and, cathode, 2, h, aq, 2, e, h, 2, g, at, temperatures, of, 60, 80, c, 140, 176, f, using, a, solid, polymer, electrolyte, and, requiring, higher, costs, of, processing, to, allow, the, solid, electrolyte, to, touch, uniformly, to, the, electrodes, similar, to, the, alkaline, electrolyser, the, proton, exchange, membrane, electrolyser, can, operate, at, higher, pressures, reducing, the, energy, costs, required, to, compress, the, hydrogen, gas, afterward, but, the, proton, exchange, membrane, electrolyser, also, benefits, from, rapid, response, times, to, changes, in, power, requirements, or, demands, and, not, needing, maintenance, at, the, cost, of, having, a, faster, inherent, degradation, rate, and, being, the, most, vulnerable, to, impurities, in, the, water, solid, oxide, electrolysers, run, the, reactions, o, 2, g, 1, 2, o, 2, g, 2, e, at, the, anode, and, h, 2, o, g, 2, e, h, 2, g, o, 2, g, at, the, cathode, the, solid, oxide, electrolysers, require, high, temperatures, 700, 1, 000, c, 1, 292, 1, 832, f, to, operate, generating, superheated, steam, they, suffer, from, degradation, when, turned, off, making, it, a, more, inflexible, hydrogen, generation, technology, in, a, selected, series, of, multiple, criteria, decision, analysis, comparisons, in, which, the, highest, priority, was, placed, on, economic, operation, costs, followed, equally, by, environmental, and, social, criteria, it, was, found, that, the, proton, exchange, membrane, electrolyser, offered, the, most, suitable, combination, of, values, e, g, investment, cost, maintenance, and, operation, cost, resistance, to, impurities, specific, energy, for, hydrogen, production, at, sea, risk, of, environmental, impact, etc, followed, by, the, alkaline, electrolyser, with, the, alkaline, electrolyser, being, the, most, economically, feasible, but, more, hazardous, in, terms, of, safety, and, environmental, concerns, due, to, the, need, for, basic, electrolyte, solutions, as, opposed, to, the, solid, polymers, used, in, proton, exchange, membranes, due, to, the, methods, conducted, in, multiple, criteria, decision, analysis, non, objective, weights, are, applied, to, the, various, factors, and, so, multiple, methods, of, decision, analysis, were, performed, simultaneously, to, examine, the, electrolysers, in, a, way, that, minimizes, the, effects, of, bias, on, the, performance, conclusions
