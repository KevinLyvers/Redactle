the, cmyk, color, model, also, known, as, process, color, or, four, color, is, a, subtractive, color, model, based, on, the, cmy, color, model, used, in, color, printing, and, is, also, used, to, describe, the, printing, process, itself, the, abbreviation, cmyk, refers, to, the, four, ink, plates, used, c, yan, m, agenta, y, ellow, and, k, ey, black, the, cmyk, model, works, by, partially, or, entirely, masking, colors, on, a, lighter, usually, white, background, the, ink, reduces, the, light, that, would, otherwise, be, reflected, such, a, model, is, called, subtractive, because, inks, subtract, the, colors, red, green, and, blue, from, white, light, white, light, minus, red, leaves, cyan, white, light, minus, green, leaves, magenta, and, white, light, minus, blue, leaves, yellow, in, additive, color, models, such, as, rgb, white, is, the, additive, combination, of, all, primary, colored, lights, and, black, is, the, absence, of, light, in, the, cmyk, model, it, is, the, opposite, white, is, the, natural, color, of, the, paper, or, other, background, black, results, from, a, full, combination, of, colored, inks, to, save, cost, on, ink, and, to, produce, deeper, black, tones, unsaturated, and, dark, colors, are, produced, by, using, black, ink, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, the, combination, of, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, with, cmyk, printing, halftoning, also, called, screening, allows, for, less, than, full, saturation, of, the, primary, colors, tiny, dots, of, each, primary, color, are, printed, in, a, pattern, small, enough, that, humans, perceive, a, solid, color, magenta, printed, with, a, 20, halftone, for, example, produces, a, pink, color, because, the, eye, perceives, the, tiny, magenta, dots, on, the, large, white, paper, as, lighter, and, less, saturated, than, the, color, of, pure, magenta, ink, halftoning, allows, for, a, continuous, variability, of, each, color, which, enables, continuous, color, mixing, of, the, primaries, without, halftoning, each, primary, would, be, binary, i, e, on, off, which, only, allows, for, the, reproduction, of, eight, colors, white, the, three, primaries, the, three, secondaries, and, black, the, cmyk, color, model, is, based, on, the, cmy, color, model, which, omits, the, black, ink, however, the, imperfect, black, generated, by, mixing, commercially, practical, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, inks, is, unsatisfactory, so, four, color, printing, uses, black, ink, in, addition, to, the, subtractive, primaries, common, reasons, for, using, black, ink, include, a, black, made, with, just, cmy, inks, is, sometimes, called, a, composite, black, when, a, very, dark, area, is, wanted, a, colored, or, gray, cmy, bedding, is, applied, first, then, a, full, black, layer, is, applied, on, top, making, a, rich, deep, black, this, is, called, rich, black, the, amount, of, black, to, use, to, replace, amounts, of, the, other, inks, is, variable, and, the, choice, depends, on, the, technology, paper, and, ink, in, use, processes, called, under, color, removal, under, color, addition, and, gray, component, replacement, are, used, to, decide, on, the, final, mix, different, cmyk, recipes, will, be, used, depending, on, the, printing, task, cmyk, or, process, color, printing, is, contrasted, with, spot, color, printing, in, which, specific, colored, inks, are, used, to, generate, the, colors, appearing, on, paper, some, printing, presses, are, capable, of, printing, with, both, four, color, process, inks, and, additional, spot, color, inks, at, the, same, time, high, quality, printed, materials, such, as, marketing, brochures, and, books, often, include, photographs, requiring, process, color, printing, other, graphic, effects, requiring, spot, colors, such, as, metallic, inks, and, finishes, such, as, varnish, which, enhances, the, glossy, appearance, of, the, printed, piece, cmyk, are, the, process, printers, which, often, have, a, relatively, small, color, gamut, processes, such, as, pantone, s, proprietary, six, color, cmykog, hexachrome, considerably, expand, the, gamut, light, saturated, colors, often, cannot, be, created, with, cmyk, and, light, colors, in, general, may, make, visible, the, halftone, pattern, using, a, ccmmyk, process, with, the, addition, of, light, cyan, and, magenta, inks, to, cmyk, can, solve, these, problems, and, such, a, process, is, used, by, many, inkjet, printers, including, desktop, models, comparisons, between, rgb, displays, and, cmyk, prints, can, be, difficult, since, the, color, reproduction, technologies, and, properties, are, very, different, a, computer, monitor, mixes, shades, of, red, green, and, blue, light, to, create, color, pictures, a, cmyk, printer, instead, uses, light, absorbing, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, inks, whose, colors, are, mixed, using, dithering, halftoning, or, some, other, optical, technique, similar, to, monitors, the, inks, used, in, printing, produce, a, color, gamut, that, is, only, a, subset, of, the, visible, spectrum, although, both, color, modes, have, their, own, specific, ranges, as, a, result, of, this, items, which, are, displayed, on, a, computer, monitor, may, not, completely, match, the, look, of, items, which, are, printed, if, opposite, color, modes, are, being, combined, in, both, mediums, when, designing, items, to, be, printed, designers, view, the, colors, which, they, are, choosing, on, an, rgb, color, mode, their, computer, screen, and, it, is, often, difficult, to, visualize, the, way, in, which, the, color, will, turn, out, post, printing, because, of, this, to, reproduce, color, the, cmyk, color, model, codes, for, absorbing, light, rather, than, emitting, it, as, is, assumed, by, rgb, the, k, component, absorbs, all, wavelengths, and, is, therefore, achromatic, the, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, components, are, used, for, color, reproduction, and, they, may, be, viewed, as, the, inverse, of, rgb, cyan, absorbs, red, magenta, absorbs, green, and, yellow, absorbs, blue, r, g, b, since, rgb, and, cmyk, spaces, are, both, device, dependent, spaces, there, is, no, simple, or, general, conversion, formula, that, converts, between, them, conversions, are, generally, done, through, color, management, systems, using, color, profiles, that, describe, the, spaces, being, converted, an, icc, profile, defines, the, bidirectional, conversion, between, a, neutral, profile, connection, color, space, cie, xyz, or, lab, and, a, selected, colorspace, in, this, case, both, rgb, and, cmyk, the, precision, of, the, conversion, depends, on, the, profile, itself, the, exact, methodology, and, because, the, gamuts, do, not, generally, match, the, rendering, intent, and, constraints, such, as, ink, limit, icc, profiles, internally, built, out, of, lookup, tables, and, other, transformation, functions, are, capable, of, handling, many, effects, of, ink, blending, one, example, is, the, dot, gain, which, show, up, as, non, linear, components, in, the, color, to, density, mapping, more, complex, interactions, such, as, neugebauer, blending, can, be, modelled, in, higher, dimension, lookup, tables, the, problem, of, computing, a, colorimetric, estimate, of, the, color, that, results, from, printing, various, combinations, of, ink, has, been, addressed, by, many, scientists, a, general, method, that, has, emerged, for, the, case, of, halftone, printing, is, to, treat, each, tiny, overlap, of, color, dots, as, one, of, 8, combinations, of, cmy, or, of, 16, combinations, of, cmyk, colors, which, in, this, context, are, known, as, neugebauer, primaries, the, resultant, color, would, be, an, area, weighted, colorimetric, combination, of, these, primary, colors, except, that, the, yule, nielsen, effect, of, scattered, light, between, and, within, the, areas, complicates, the, physics, and, the, analysis, empirical, formulas, for, such, analysis, have, been, developed, in, terms, of, detailed, dye, combination, absorption, spectra, and, empirical, parameters, standardization, of, printing, practices, allow, for, some, profiles, to, be, predefined, one, of, them, is, the, us, specifications, for, web, offset, publications, which, has, its, icc, color, profile, built, into, some, software, including, microsoft, office, as, agfa, rswop, icm
