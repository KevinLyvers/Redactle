photochemistry, is, the, branch, of, chemistry, concerned, with, the, chemical, effects, of, light, generally, this, term, is, used, to, describe, a, chemical, reaction, caused, by, absorption, of, ultraviolet, wavelength, from, 100, to, 400, nm, visible, 400, 750, nm, or, infrared, radiation, 750, 2500, nm, in, nature, photochemistry, is, of, immense, importance, as, it, is, the, basis, of, photosynthesis, vision, and, the, formation, of, vitamin, d, with, sunlight, it, is, also, responsible, for, the, appearance, of, dna, mutations, leading, to, skin, cancers, photochemical, reactions, proceed, differently, than, temperature, driven, reactions, photochemical, paths, access, high, energy, intermediates, that, cannot, be, generated, thermally, thereby, overcoming, large, activation, barriers, in, a, short, period, of, time, and, allowing, reactions, otherwise, inaccessible, by, thermal, processes, photochemistry, can, also, be, destructive, as, illustrated, by, the, photodegradation, of, plastics, photoexcitation, is, the, first, step, in, a, photochemical, process, where, the, reactant, is, elevated, to, a, state, of, higher, energy, an, excited, state, the, first, law, of, photochemistry, known, as, the, grotthuss, draper, law, for, chemists, theodor, grotthuss, and, john, w, draper, states, that, light, must, be, absorbed, by, a, chemical, substance, in, order, for, a, photochemical, reaction, to, take, place, according, to, the, second, law, of, photochemistry, known, as, the, stark, einstein, law, for, physicists, johannes, stark, and, albert, einstein, for, each, photon, of, light, absorbed, by, a, chemical, system, no, more, than, one, molecule, is, activated, for, a, photochemical, reaction, as, defined, by, the, quantum, yield, when, a, molecule, or, atom, in, the, ground, state, s, 0, absorbs, light, one, electron, is, excited, to, a, higher, orbital, level, this, electron, maintains, its, spin, according, to, the, spin, selection, rule, other, transitions, would, violate, the, law, of, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, excitation, to, a, higher, singlet, state, can, be, from, homo, to, lumo, or, to, a, higher, orbital, so, that, singlet, excitation, states, s, 1, s, 2, s, 3, at, different, energies, are, possible, kasha, s, rule, stipulates, that, higher, singlet, states, would, quickly, relax, by, radiationless, decay, or, internal, conversion, ic, to, s, 1, thus, s, 1, is, usually, but, not, always, the, only, relevant, singlet, excited, state, this, excited, state, s, 1, can, further, relax, to, s, 0, by, ic, but, also, by, an, allowed, radiative, transition, from, s, 1, to, s, 0, that, emits, a, photon, this, process, is, called, fluorescence, alternatively, it, is, possible, for, the, excited, state, s, 1, to, undergo, spin, inversion, and, to, generate, a, triplet, excited, state, t, 1, having, two, unpaired, electrons, with, the, same, spin, this, violation, of, the, spin, selection, rule, is, possible, by, intersystem, crossing, isc, of, the, vibrational, and, electronic, levels, of, s, 1, and, t, 1, according, to, hund, s, rule, of, maximum, multiplicity, this, t, 1, state, would, be, somewhat, more, stable, than, s, 1, this, triplet, state, can, relax, to, the, ground, state, s, 0, by, radiationless, isc, or, by, a, radiation, pathway, called, phosphorescence, this, process, implies, a, change, of, electronic, spin, which, is, forbidden, by, spin, selection, rules, making, phosphorescence, from, t, 1, to, s, 0, much, slower, than, fluorescence, from, s, 1, to, s, 0, thus, triplet, states, generally, have, longer, lifetimes, than, singlet, states, these, transitions, are, usually, summarized, in, a, state, energy, diagram, or, jablonski, diagram, the, paradigm, of, molecular, photochemistry, these, excited, species, either, s, 1, or, t, 1, have, a, half, empty, low, energy, orbital, and, are, consequently, more, oxidizing, than, the, ground, state, but, at, the, same, time, they, have, an, electron, in, a, high, energy, orbital, and, are, thus, more, reducing, in, general, excited, species, are, prone, to, participate, in, electron, transfer, processes, photochemical, reactions, require, a, light, source, that, emits, wavelengths, corresponding, to, an, electronic, transition, in, the, reactant, in, the, early, experiments, and, in, everyday, life, sunlight, was, the, light, source, although, it, is, polychromatic, mercury, vapor, lamps, are, more, common, in, the, laboratory, low, pressure, mercury, vapor, lamps, mainly, emit, at, 254, nm, for, polychromatic, sources, wavelength, ranges, can, be, selected, using, filters, alternatively, laser, beams, are, usually, monochromatic, although, two, or, more, wavelengths, can, be, obtained, using, nonlinear, optics, and, leds, have, a, relatively, narrow, band, that, can, be, efficiently, used, as, well, as, rayonet, lamps, to, get, approximately, monochromatic, beams, the, emitted, light, must, reach, the, targeted, functional, group, without, being, blocked, by, the, reactor, medium, or, other, functional, groups, present, for, many, applications, quartz, is, used, for, the, reactors, as, well, as, to, contain, the, lamp, pyrex, absorbs, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 275, nm, the, solvent, is, an, important, experimental, parameter, solvents, are, potential, reactants, and, for, this, reason, chlorinated, solvents, are, avoided, because, the, c, cl, bond, can, lead, to, chlorination, of, the, substrate, strongly, absorbing, solvents, prevent, photons, from, reaching, the, substrate, hydrocarbon, solvents, absorb, only, at, short, wavelengths, and, are, thus, preferred, for, photochemical, experiments, requiring, high, energy, photons, solvents, containing, unsaturation, absorb, at, longer, wavelengths, and, can, usefully, filter, out, short, wavelengths, for, example, cyclohexane, and, acetone, cut, off, absorb, strongly, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 215, and, 330, nm, respectively, typically, the, wavelength, employed, to, induce, a, photochemical, process, is, selected, based, on, the, absorption, spectrum, of, the, reactive, species, most, often, the, absorption, maximum, over, the, last, years, however, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, in, the, majority, of, bond, forming, reactions, the, absorption, spectrum, does, not, allow, selecting, the, optimum, wavelength, to, achieve, the, highest, reaction, yield, based, on, absorptivity, this, fundamental, mismatch, between, absorptivity, and, reactivity, has, been, elucidated, with, so, called, photochemical, action, plots, continuous, flow, photochemistry, offers, multiple, advantages, over, batch, photochemistry, photochemical, reactions, are, driven, by, the, number, of, photons, that, are, able, to, activate, molecules, causing, the, desired, reaction, the, large, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, of, a, microreactor, maximizes, the, illumination, and, at, the, same, time, allows, for, efficient, cooling, which, decreases, the, thermal, side, products, in, the, case, of, photochemical, reactions, light, provides, the, activation, energy, simplistically, light, is, one, mechanism, for, providing, the, activation, energy, required, for, many, reactions, if, laser, light, is, employed, it, is, possible, to, selectively, excite, a, molecule, so, as, to, produce, a, desired, electronic, and, vibrational, state, equally, the, emission, from, a, particular, state, may, be, selectively, monitored, providing, a, measure, of, the, population, of, that, state, if, the, chemical, system, is, at, low, pressure, this, enables, scientists, to, observe, the, energy, distribution, of, the, products, of, a, chemical, reaction, before, the, differences, in, energy, have, been, smeared, out, and, averaged, by, repeated, collisions, the, absorption, of, a, photon, by, a, reactant, molecule, may, also, permit, a, reaction, to, occur, not, just, by, bringing, the, molecule, to, the, necessary, activation, energy, but, also, by, changing, the, symmetry, of, the, molecule, s, electronic, configuration, enabling, an, otherwise, inaccessible, reaction, path, as, described, by, the, woodward, hoffmann, selection, rules, a, cycloaddition, reaction, is, one, example, of, a, pericyclic, reaction, that, can, be, analyzed, using, these, rules, or, by, the, related, frontier, molecular, orbital, theory, some, photochemical, reactions, are, several, orders, of, magnitude, faster, than, thermal, reactions, reactions, as, fast, as, 10, 9, seconds, and, associated, processes, as, fast, as, 10, 15, seconds, are, often, observed, the, photon, can, be, absorbed, directly, by, the, reactant, or, by, a, photosensitizer, which, absorbs, the, photon, and, transfers, the, energy, to, the, reactant, the, opposite, process, when, a, photoexcited, state, is, deactivated, by, a, chemical, reagent, is, called, quenching, most, photochemical, transformations, occur, through, a, series, of, simple, steps, known, as, primary, photochemical, processes, one, common, example, of, these, processes, is, the, excited, state, proton, transfer, examples, of, photochemical, organic, reactions, are, electrocyclic, reactions, radical, reactions, photoisomerization, and, norrish, reactions, alkenes, undergo, many, important, reactions, that, proceed, via, a, photon, induced, to, transition, the, first, electronic, excited, state, of, an, alkene, lacks, the, bond, so, that, rotation, about, the, c, c, bond, is, rapid, and, the, molecule, engages, in, reactions, not, observed, thermally, these, reactions, include, cis, trans, isomerization, and, cycloaddition, to, other, ground, state, alkene, to, give, cyclobutane, derivatives, the, cis, trans, isomerization, of, a, poly, alkene, is, involved, in, retinal, a, component, of, the, machinery, of, vision, the, dimerization, of, alkenes, is, relevant, to, the, photodamage, of, dna, where, thymine, dimers, are, observed, upon, illuminating, dna, with, uv, radiation, such, dimers, interfere, with, transcription, the, beneficial, effects, of, sunlight, are, associated, with, the, photochemically, induced, retro, cyclization, decyclization, reaction, of, ergosterol, to, give, vitamin, d, in, the, demayo, reaction, an, alkene, reacts, with, a, 1, 3, diketone, reacts, via, its, enol, to, yield, a, 1, 5, diketone, still, another, common, photochemical, reaction, is, howard, zimmerman, s, di, methane, rearrangement, in, an, industrial, application, about, 100, 000, tonnes, of, benzyl, chloride, are, prepared, annually, by, the, gas, phase, photochemical, reaction, of, toluene, with, chlorine, the, light, is, absorbed, by, chlorine, molecules, the, low, energy, of, this, transition, being, indicated, by, the, yellowish, color, of, the, gas, the, photon, induces, homolysis, of, the, cl, cl, bond, and, the, resulting, chlorine, radical, converts, toluene, to, the, benzyl, radical, mercaptans, can, be, produced, by, photochemical, addition, of, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, to, alpha, olefins, coordination, complexes, and, organometallic, compounds, are, also, photoreactive, these, reactions, can, entail, cis, trans, isomerization, more, commonly, photoreactions, result, in, dissociation, of, ligands, since, the, photon, excites, an, electron, on, the, metal, to, an, orbital, that, is, antibonding, with, respect, to, the, ligands, thus, metal, carbonyls, that, resist, thermal, substitution, undergo, decarbonylation, upon, irradiation, with, uv, light, uv, irradiation, of, a, thf, solution, of, molybdenum, hexacarbonyl, gives, the, thf, complex, which, is, synthetically, useful, in, a, related, reaction, photolysis, of, iron, pentacarbonyl, affords, diiron, nonacarbonyl, see, figure, select, photoreactive, coordination, complexes, can, undergo, oxidation, reduction, processes, via, single, electron, transfer, this, electron, transfer, can, occur, within, the, inner, or, outer, coordination, sphere, of, the, metal, here, are, some, different, types, of, photochemical, reactions, although, bleaching, has, long, been, practiced, the, first, photochemical, reaction, was, described, by, trommsdorff, in, 1834, he, observed, that, crystals, of, the, compound, santonin, when, exposed, to, sunlight, turned, yellow, and, burst, in, a, 2007, study, the, reaction, was, described, as, a, succession, of, three, steps, taking, place, within, a, single, crystal, the, first, step, is, a, rearrangement, reaction, to, a, cyclopentadienone, intermediate, 2, the, second, one, a, dimerization, in, a, diels, alder, reaction, 3, and, the, third, one, an, intramolecular, cycloaddition, 4, the, bursting, effect, is, attributed, to, a, large, change, in, crystal, volume, on, dimerization, the, organization, of, these, conferences, is, facilitated, by, the, international, foundation, for, photochemistry
