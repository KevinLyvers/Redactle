in, celestial, mechanics, escape, velocity, or, escape, speed, is, the, minimum, speed, needed, for, an, object, to, escape, from, contact, with, or, orbit, of, a, primary, body, assuming, although, the, term, escape, velocity, is, common, it, is, more, accurately, described, as, a, speed, than, a, velocity, because, it, is, independent, of, direction, because, gravitational, force, between, two, objects, depends, on, their, combined, mass, the, escape, speed, also, depends, on, mass, for, artificial, satellites, and, small, natural, objects, the, mass, of, the, object, makes, a, negligible, contribution, to, the, combined, mass, and, so, is, often, ignored, escape, speed, varies, with, distance, from, the, center, of, the, primary, body, as, does, the, velocity, of, an, object, traveling, under, the, gravitational, influence, of, the, primary, if, an, object, is, in, a, circular, or, elliptical, orbit, its, speed, is, always, less, than, the, escape, speed, at, its, current, distance, in, contrast, if, it, is, on, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, its, speed, will, always, be, higher, than, the, escape, speed, at, its, current, distance, it, will, slow, down, as, it, gets, to, greater, distance, but, do, so, asymptotically, approaching, a, positive, speed, an, object, on, a, parabolic, trajectory, will, always, be, traveling, exactly, the, escape, speed, at, its, current, distance, it, has, precisely, balanced, positive, kinetic, energy, and, negative, gravitational, potential, energy, it, will, always, be, slowing, down, asymptotically, approaching, zero, speed, but, never, quite, stop, escape, velocity, calculations, are, typically, used, to, determine, whether, an, object, will, remain, in, the, gravitational, sphere, of, influence, of, a, given, body, for, example, in, solar, system, exploration, it, is, useful, to, know, whether, a, probe, will, continue, to, orbit, the, earth, or, escape, to, a, heliocentric, orbit, it, is, also, useful, to, know, how, much, a, probe, will, need, to, slow, down, in, order, to, be, gravitationally, captured, by, its, destination, body, rockets, do, not, have, to, reach, escape, velocity, in, a, single, maneuver, and, objects, can, also, use, a, gravity, assist, to, siphon, kinetic, energy, away, from, large, bodies, precise, trajectory, calculations, require, taking, into, account, small, forces, like, atmospheric, drag, radiation, pressure, and, solar, wind, a, rocket, under, continuous, or, intermittent, thrust, or, an, object, climbing, a, space, elevator, can, attain, escape, at, any, non, zero, speed, but, the, minimum, amount, of, energy, required, to, do, so, is, always, the, same, escape, speed, at, a, distance, d, from, the, center, of, a, spherically, symmetric, primary, body, such, as, a, star, or, a, planet, with, mass, m, is, given, by, the, formula, where, the, value, gm, is, called, the, standard, gravitational, parameter, or, and, is, often, known, more, accurately, than, either, g, or, m, separately, when, given, an, initial, speed, v, displaystyle, v, greater, than, the, escape, speed, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, the, object, will, asymptotically, approach, the, hyperbolic, excess, speed, v, displaystyle, v, infty, satisfying, the, equation, for, example, an, agreed, upon, definitional, value, for, standard, gravity, is, 9, 80665, m, s, 2, 32, 1740, ft, s, 2, and, the, escape, velocity, is, 11, 186, km, s, 40, 270, km, h, 25, 020, mph, 36, 700, ft, s, this, is, approximately, 33, times, the, speed, of, sound, mach, 33, and, several, times, the, muzzle, velocity, of, a, rifle, bullet, up, to, 1, 7, km, s, at, 9, 000, km, altitude, escape, velocity, is, slightly, less, than, 7, 1, km, s, these, velocities, are, relative, to, a, non, rotating, frame, of, reference, launching, near, the, equator, rather, than, the, poles, can, actually, provide, a, boost, in, this, context, when, taking, earth, as, the, primary, body, escape, velocity, is, sometimes, called, the, second, cosmic, velocity, for, an, object, of, mass, m, displaystyle, m, the, energy, required, to, escape, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, is, gmm, r, a, function, of, the, object, s, mass, where, r, is, radius, of, the, earth, nominally, 6, 371, kilometres, 3, 959, mi, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, and, m, is, the, mass, of, the, earth, m, 5, 9736, 10, 24, kg, a, related, quantity, is, the, specific, orbital, energy, which, is, essentially, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, and, potential, energy, divided, by, the, mass, an, object, has, reached, escape, velocity, when, the, specific, orbital, energy, is, greater, than, or, equal, to, zero, the, existence, of, escape, velocity, can, be, thought, of, as, a, consequence, of, conservation, of, energy, and, an, energy, field, of, finite, depth, for, an, object, with, a, given, total, energy, which, is, moving, subject, to, conservative, forces, such, as, a, static, gravity, field, it, is, only, possible, for, the, object, to, reach, combinations, of, locations, and, speeds, which, have, that, total, energy, places, which, have, a, higher, potential, energy, than, this, cannot, be, reached, at, all, adding, speed, kinetic, energy, to, an, object, expands, the, region, of, locations, it, can, reach, until, with, enough, energy, everywhere, to, infinity, becomes, accessible, the, formula, for, escape, velocity, can, be, derived, from, the, principle, of, conservation, of, energy, for, the, sake, of, simplicity, unless, stated, otherwise, we, assume, that, an, object, will, escape, the, gravitational, field, of, a, uniform, spherical, planet, by, moving, away, from, it, and, that, the, only, significant, force, acting, on, the, moving, object, is, the, planet, s, gravity, imagine, that, a, spaceship, of, mass, m, is, initially, at, a, distance, r, from, the, center, of, mass, of, the, planet, whose, mass, is, m, and, its, initial, speed, is, equal, to, its, escape, velocity, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, at, its, final, state, it, will, be, an, infinite, distance, away, from, the, planet, and, its, speed, will, be, negligibly, small, kinetic, energy, k, and, gravitational, potential, energy, u, g, are, the, only, types, of, energy, that, we, will, deal, with, we, will, ignore, the, drag, of, the, atmosphere, so, by, the, conservation, of, energy, we, can, set, k, final, 0, because, final, velocity, is, arbitrarily, small, and, u, g, final, 0, because, final, gravitational, potential, energy, is, defined, to, be, zero, a, long, distance, away, from, a, planet, so, the, same, result, is, obtained, by, a, relativistic, calculation, in, which, case, the, variable, r, represents, the, radial, coordinate, or, reduced, circumference, of, the, schwarzschild, metric, an, alternative, expression, for, the, escape, velocity, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, particularly, useful, at, the, surface, on, the, body, is, where, r, is, the, distance, between, the, center, of, the, body, and, the, point, at, which, escape, velocity, is, being, calculated, and, g, is, the, gravitational, acceleration, at, that, distance, i, e, the, surface, gravity, for, a, body, with, a, spherically, symmetric, distribution, of, mass, the, escape, velocity, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, from, the, surface, is, proportional, to, the, radius, assuming, constant, density, and, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, average, density, where, k, 8, 3, g, 2, 364, 10, 5, m, 1, 5, kg, 0, 5, s, 1, textstyle, k, sqrt, frac, 8, 3, pi, g, approx, 2, 364, times, 10, 5, text, m, 1, 5, text, kg, 0, 5, text, s, 1, this, escape, velocity, is, relative, to, a, non, rotating, frame, of, reference, not, relative, to, the, moving, surface, of, the, planet, or, moon, as, explained, below, the, escape, velocity, relative, to, the, surface, of, a, rotating, body, depends, on, direction, in, which, the, escaping, body, travels, for, example, as, the, earth, s, rotational, velocity, is, 465, m, s, at, the, equator, a, rocket, launched, tangentially, from, the, earth, s, equator, to, the, east, requires, an, initial, velocity, of, about, 10, 735, km, s, relative, to, the, moving, surface, at, the, point, of, launch, to, escape, whereas, a, rocket, launched, tangentially, from, the, earth, s, equator, to, the, west, requires, an, initial, velocity, of, about, 11, 665, km, s, relative, to, that, moving, surface, the, surface, velocity, decreases, with, the, cosine, of, the, geographic, latitude, so, space, launch, facilities, are, often, located, as, close, to, the, equator, as, feasible, e, g, the, american, cape, canaveral, latitude, 28, 28, n, and, the, french, guiana, space, centre, latitude, 5, 14, n, in, most, situations, it, is, impractical, to, achieve, escape, velocity, almost, instantly, because, of, the, acceleration, implied, and, also, because, if, there, is, an, atmosphere, the, hypersonic, speeds, involved, on, earth, a, speed, of, 11, 2, km, s, or, 40, 320, km, h, would, cause, most, objects, to, burn, up, due, to, aerodynamic, heating, or, be, torn, apart, by, atmospheric, drag, for, an, actual, escape, orbit, a, spacecraft, will, accelerate, steadily, out, of, the, atmosphere, until, it, reaches, the, escape, velocity, appropriate, for, its, altitude, which, will, be, less, than, on, the, surface, in, many, cases, the, spacecraft, may, be, first, placed, in, a, parking, orbit, e, g, a, low, earth, orbit, at, 160, 2, 000, km, and, then, accelerated, to, the, escape, velocity, at, that, altitude, which, will, be, slightly, lower, about, 11, 0, km, s, at, a, low, earth, orbit, of, 200, km, the, required, additional, change, in, speed, however, is, far, less, because, the, spacecraft, already, has, a, significant, orbital, speed, in, low, earth, orbit, speed, is, approximately, 7, 8, km, s, or, 28, 080, km, h, the, escape, velocity, at, a, given, height, is, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, times, the, speed, in, a, circular, orbit, at, the, same, height, compare, this, with, the, velocity, equation, in, circular, orbit, this, corresponds, to, the, fact, that, the, potential, energy, with, respect, to, infinity, of, an, object, in, such, an, orbit, is, minus, two, times, its, kinetic, energy, while, to, escape, the, sum, of, potential, and, kinetic, energy, needs, to, be, at, least, zero, the, velocity, corresponding, to, the, circular, orbit, is, sometimes, called, the, first, cosmic, velocity, whereas, in, this, context, the, escape, velocity, is, referred, to, as, the, second, cosmic, velocity, for, a, body, in, an, elliptical, orbit, wishing, to, accelerate, to, an, escape, orbit, the, required, speed, will, vary, and, will, be, greatest, at, periapsis, when, the, body, is, closest, to, the, central, body, however, the, orbital, speed, of, the, body, will, also, be, at, its, highest, at, this, point, and, the, change, in, velocity, required, will, be, at, its, lowest, as, explained, by, the, oberth, effect, escape, velocity, can, either, be, measured, as, relative, to, the, other, central, body, or, relative, to, center, of, mass, or, barycenter, of, the, system, of, bodies, thus, for, systems, of, two, bodies, the, term, escape, velocity, can, be, ambiguous, but, it, is, usually, intended, to, mean, the, barycentric, escape, velocity, of, the, less, massive, body, escape, velocity, usually, refers, to, the, escape, velocity, of, zero, mass, test, particles, for, zero, mass, test, particles, we, have, that, the, relative, to, the, other, and, the, barycentric, escape, velocities, are, the, same, namely, v, e, 2, g, m, d, displaystyle, v, e, sqrt, frac, 2gm, d, but, when, we, can, t, neglect, the, smaller, mass, say, m, displaystyle, m, we, arrive, at, slightly, different, formulas, because, the, system, has, to, obey, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, we, see, that, both, the, larger, and, the, smaller, mass, must, be, accelerated, in, the, gravitational, field, relative, to, the, center, of, mass, the, velocity, of, the, larger, mass, v, p, displaystyle, v, p, for, planet, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, velocity, of, the, smaller, mass, v, r, displaystyle, v, r, for, rocket, we, get, v, p, m, m, v, r, displaystyle, v, p, frac, m, m, v, r, the, barycentric, escape, velocity, now, becomes, v, r, 2, g, m, 2, d, m, m, 2, g, m, d, displaystyle, v, r, sqrt, frac, 2gm, 2, d, m, m, approx, sqrt, frac, 2gm, d, while, the, relative, to, the, other, escape, velocity, becomes, v, r, v, p, 2, g, m, m, d, 2, g, m, d, displaystyle, v, r, v, p, sqrt, frac, 2g, m, m, d, approx, sqrt, frac, 2gm, d, ignoring, all, factors, other, than, the, gravitational, force, between, the, body, and, the, object, an, object, projected, vertically, at, speed, v, displaystyle, v, from, the, surface, of, a, spherical, body, with, escape, velocity, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, and, radius, r, displaystyle, r, will, attain, a, maximum, height, h, displaystyle, h, satisfying, the, equation, which, solving, for, h, results, in, where, x, v, v, e, textstyle, x, v, v, e, is, the, ratio, of, the, original, speed, v, displaystyle, v, to, the, escape, velocity, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, unlike, escape, velocity, the, direction, vertically, up, is, important, to, achieve, maximum, height, if, an, object, attains, exactly, escape, velocity, but, is, not, directed, straight, away, from, the, planet, then, it, will, follow, a, curved, path, or, trajectory, although, this, trajectory, does, not, form, a, closed, shape, it, can, be, referred, to, as, an, orbit, assuming, that, gravity, is, the, only, significant, force, in, the, system, this, object, s, speed, at, any, point, in, the, trajectory, will, be, equal, to, the, escape, velocity, at, that, point, due, to, the, conservation, of, energy, its, total, energy, must, always, be, 0, which, implies, that, it, always, has, escape, velocity, see, the, derivation, above, the, shape, of, the, trajectory, will, be, a, parabola, whose, focus, is, located, at, the, center, of, mass, of, the, planet, an, actual, escape, requires, a, course, with, a, trajectory, that, does, not, intersect, with, the, planet, or, its, atmosphere, since, this, would, cause, the, object, to, crash, when, moving, away, from, the, source, this, path, is, called, an, escape, orbit, escape, orbits, are, known, as, c3, 0, orbits, c3, is, the, characteristic, energy, gm, 2, a, where, a, is, the, semi, major, axis, which, is, infinite, for, parabolic, trajectories, if, the, body, has, a, velocity, greater, than, escape, velocity, then, its, path, will, form, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, and, it, will, have, an, excess, hyperbolic, velocity, equivalent, to, the, extra, energy, the, body, has, a, relatively, small, extra, delta, v, above, that, needed, to, accelerate, to, the, escape, speed, can, result, in, a, relatively, large, speed, at, infinity, some, orbital, manoeuvres, make, use, of, this, fact, for, example, at, a, place, where, escape, speed, is, 11, 2, km, s, the, addition, of, 0, 4, km, s, yields, a, hyperbolic, excess, speed, of, 3, 02, km, s, if, a, body, in, circular, orbit, or, at, the, periapsis, of, an, elliptical, orbit, accelerates, along, its, direction, of, travel, to, escape, velocity, the, point, of, acceleration, will, form, the, periapsis, of, the, escape, trajectory, the, eventual, direction, of, travel, will, be, at, 90, degrees, to, the, direction, at, the, point, of, acceleration, if, the, body, accelerates, to, beyond, escape, velocity, the, eventual, direction, of, travel, will, be, at, a, smaller, angle, and, indicated, by, one, of, the, asymptotes, of, the, hyperbolic, trajectory, it, is, now, taking, this, means, the, timing, of, the, acceleration, is, critical, if, the, intention, is, to, escape, in, a, particular, direction, if, the, speed, at, periapsis, is, v, then, the, eccentricity, of, the, trajectory, is, given, by, this, is, valid, for, elliptical, parabolic, and, hyperbolic, trajectories, if, the, trajectory, is, hyperbolic, or, parabolic, it, will, asymptotically, approach, an, angle, displaystyle, theta, from, the, direction, at, periapsis, with, the, speed, will, asymptotically, approach, in, this, table, the, left, hand, half, gives, the, escape, velocity, from, the, visible, surface, which, may, be, gaseous, as, with, jupiter, for, example, relative, to, the, centre, of, the, planet, or, moon, that, is, not, relative, to, its, moving, surface, in, the, right, hand, half, v, e, refers, to, the, speed, relative, to, the, central, body, for, example, the, sun, whereas, v, te, is, the, speed, at, the, visible, surface, of, the, smaller, body, relative, to, the, smaller, body, planet, or, moon, the, last, two, columns, will, depend, precisely, where, in, orbit, escape, velocity, is, reached, as, the, orbits, are, not, exactly, circular, particularly, mercury, and, pluto, let, g, be, the, gravitational, constant, and, let, m, be, the, mass, of, the, earth, or, other, gravitating, body, and, m, be, the, mass, of, the, escaping, body, or, projectile, at, a, distance, r, from, the, centre, of, gravitation, the, body, feels, an, attractive, force, the, work, needed, to, move, the, body, over, a, small, distance, dr, against, this, force, is, therefore, given, by, the, total, work, needed, to, move, the, body, from, the, surface, r, 0, of, the, gravitating, body, to, infinity, is, then, in, order, to, do, this, work, to, reach, infinity, the, body, s, minimal, kinetic, energy, at, departure, must, match, this, work, so, the, escape, velocity, v, 0, satisfies, which, results, in
