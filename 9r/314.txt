ionic, bonding, is, a, type, of, chemical, bonding, that, involves, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, oppositely, charged, ions, or, between, two, atoms, with, sharply, different, electronegativities, and, is, the, primary, interaction, occurring, in, ionic, compounds, it, is, one, of, the, main, types, of, bonding, along, with, covalent, bonding, and, metallic, bonding, ions, are, atoms, or, groups, of, atoms, with, an, electrostatic, charge, atoms, that, gain, electrons, make, negatively, charged, ions, called, anions, atoms, that, lose, electrons, make, positively, charged, ions, called, cations, this, transfer, of, electrons, is, known, as, electrovalence, in, contrast, to, covalence, in, the, simplest, case, the, cation, is, a, metal, atom, and, the, anion, is, a, nonmetal, atom, but, these, ions, can, be, more, complex, e, g, molecular, ions, like, nh, 4, or, so, 2, 4, in, simpler, words, an, ionic, bond, results, from, the, transfer, of, electrons, from, a, metal, to, a, non, metal, to, obtain, a, full, valence, shell, for, both, atoms, clean, ionic, bonding, in, which, one, atom, or, molecule, completely, transfers, an, electron, to, another, cannot, exist, all, ionic, compounds, have, some, degree, of, covalent, bonding, or, electron, sharing, thus, the, term, ionic, bonding, is, given, when, the, ionic, character, is, greater, than, the, covalent, character, that, is, a, bond, in, which, there, is, a, large, difference, in, electronegativity, between, the, two, atoms, causing, the, bonding, to, be, more, polar, ionic, than, in, covalent, bonding, where, electrons, are, shared, more, equally, bonds, with, partially, ionic, and, partially, covalent, characters, are, called, polar, covalent, bonds, ionic, compounds, conduct, electricity, when, molten, or, in, solution, typically, not, when, solid, ionic, compounds, generally, have, a, high, melting, point, depending, on, the, charge, of, the, ions, they, consist, of, the, higher, the, charges, the, stronger, the, cohesive, forces, and, the, higher, the, melting, point, they, also, tend, to, be, soluble, in, water, the, stronger, the, cohesive, forces, the, lower, the, solubility, atoms, that, have, an, almost, full, or, almost, empty, valence, shell, tend, to, be, very, reactive, strongly, electronegative, atoms, such, as, halogens, often, have, only, one, or, two, empty, electron, states, in, their, valence, shell, and, frequently, bond, with, other, atoms, or, gain, electrons, to, form, anions, weakly, electronegative, atoms, such, as, alkali, metals, have, relatively, few, valence, electrons, which, can, easily, be, lost, to, strongly, electronegative, atoms, as, a, result, weakly, electronegative, atoms, tend, to, distort, their, electron, cloud, and, form, cations, ionic, bonding, can, result, from, a, redox, reaction, when, atoms, of, an, element, usually, metal, whose, ionization, energy, is, low, give, some, of, their, electrons, to, achieve, a, stable, electron, configuration, in, doing, so, cations, are, formed, an, atom, of, another, element, usually, nonmetal, with, greater, electron, affinity, accepts, one, or, more, electrons, to, attain, a, stable, electron, configuration, and, after, accepting, electrons, an, atom, becomes, an, anion, typically, the, stable, electron, configuration, is, one, of, the, noble, gases, for, elements, in, the, s, block, and, the, p, block, and, particular, stable, electron, configurations, for, d, block, and, f, block, elements, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, the, anions, and, cations, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, solid, with, a, crystallographic, lattice, in, which, the, ions, are, stacked, in, an, alternating, fashion, in, such, a, lattice, it, is, usually, not, possible, to, distinguish, discrete, molecular, units, so, that, the, compounds, formed, are, not, molecular, however, the, ions, themselves, can, be, complex, and, form, molecular, ions, like, the, acetate, anion, or, the, ammonium, cation, for, example, common, table, salt, is, sodium, chloride, when, sodium, na, and, chlorine, cl, are, combined, the, sodium, atoms, each, lose, an, electron, forming, cations, na, and, the, chlorine, atoms, each, gain, an, electron, to, form, anions, cl, these, ions, are, then, attracted, to, each, other, in, a, 1, 1, ratio, to, form, sodium, chloride, nacl, however, to, maintain, charge, neutrality, strict, ratios, between, anions, and, cations, are, observed, so, that, ionic, compounds, in, general, obey, the, rules, of, stoichiometry, despite, not, being, molecular, compounds, for, compounds, that, are, transitional, to, the, alloys, and, possess, mixed, ionic, and, metallic, bonding, this, may, not, be, the, case, anymore, many, sulfides, e, g, do, form, non, stoichiometric, compounds, many, ionic, compounds, are, referred, to, as, salts, as, they, can, also, be, formed, by, the, neutralization, reaction, of, an, arrhenius, base, like, naoh, with, an, arrhenius, acid, like, hcl, the, salt, nacl, is, then, said, to, consist, of, the, acid, rest, cl, and, the, base, rest, na, the, removal, of, electrons, to, form, the, cation, is, endothermic, raising, the, system, s, overall, energy, there, may, also, be, energy, changes, associated, with, breaking, of, existing, bonds, or, the, addition, of, more, than, one, electron, to, form, anions, however, the, action, of, the, anion, s, accepting, the, cation, s, valence, electrons, and, the, subsequent, attraction, of, the, ions, to, each, other, releases, lattice, energy, and, thus, lowers, the, overall, energy, of, the, system, ionic, bonding, will, occur, only, if, the, overall, energy, change, for, the, reaction, is, favorable, in, general, the, reaction, is, exothermic, but, e, g, the, formation, of, mercuric, oxide, hgo, is, endothermic, the, charge, of, the, resulting, ions, is, a, major, factor, in, the, strength, of, ionic, bonding, e, g, a, salt, c, a, is, held, together, by, electrostatic, forces, roughly, four, times, weaker, than, c, 2, a, 2, according, to, coulomb, s, law, where, c, and, a, represent, a, generic, cation, and, anion, respectively, the, sizes, of, the, ions, and, the, particular, packing, of, the, lattice, are, ignored, in, this, rather, simplistic, argument, ionic, compounds, in, the, solid, state, form, lattice, structures, the, two, principal, factors, in, determining, the, form, of, the, lattice, are, the, relative, charges, of, the, ions, and, their, relative, sizes, some, structures, are, adopted, by, a, number, of, compounds, for, example, the, structure, of, the, rock, salt, sodium, chloride, is, also, adopted, by, many, alkali, halides, and, binary, oxides, such, as, magnesium, oxide, pauling, s, rules, provide, guidelines, for, predicting, and, rationalizing, the, crystal, structures, of, ionic, crystals, for, a, solid, crystalline, ionic, compound, the, enthalpy, change, in, forming, the, solid, from, gaseous, ions, is, termed, the, lattice, energy, the, experimental, value, for, the, lattice, energy, can, be, determined, using, the, born, haber, cycle, it, can, also, be, calculated, predicted, using, the, born, land, equation, as, the, sum, of, the, electrostatic, potential, energy, calculated, by, summing, interactions, between, cations, and, anions, and, a, short, range, repulsive, potential, energy, term, the, electrostatic, potential, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, interionic, separation, and, a, constant, madelung, constant, that, takes, account, of, the, geometry, of, the, crystal, the, further, away, from, the, nucleus, the, weaker, the, shield, the, born, land, equation, gives, a, reasonable, fit, to, the, lattice, energy, of, e, g, sodium, chloride, where, the, calculated, predicted, value, is, 756, kj, mol, which, compares, to, 787, kj, mol, using, the, born, haber, cycle, in, aqueous, solution, the, binding, strength, can, be, described, by, the, bjerrum, or, fuoss, equation, as, function, of, the, ion, charges, rather, independent, of, the, nature, of, the, ions, such, as, polarizability, or, size, the, strength, of, salt, bridges, is, most, often, evaluated, by, measurements, of, equilibria, between, molecules, containing, cationic, and, anionic, sites, most, often, in, solution, equilibrium, constants, in, water, indicate, additive, free, energy, contributions, for, each, salt, bridge, another, method, for, the, identification, of, hydrogen, bonds, also, in, complicated, molecules, is, crystallography, sometimes, also, nmr, spectroscopy, the, attractive, forces, defining, the, strength, of, ionic, bonding, can, be, modeled, by, coulomb, s, law, ionic, bond, strengths, are, typically, cited, ranges, vary, between, 170, and, 1500, kj, mol, ions, in, crystal, lattices, of, purely, ionic, compounds, are, spherical, however, if, the, positive, ion, is, small, and, or, highly, charged, it, will, distort, the, electron, cloud, of, the, negative, ion, an, effect, summarised, in, fajans, rules, this, polarization, of, the, negative, ion, leads, to, a, build, up, of, extra, charge, density, between, the, two, nuclei, that, is, to, partial, covalency, larger, negative, ions, are, more, easily, polarized, but, the, effect, is, usually, important, only, when, positive, ions, with, charges, of, 3, e, g, al, 3, are, involved, however, 2, ions, be, 2, or, even, 1, li, show, some, polarizing, power, because, their, sizes, are, so, small, e, g, lii, is, ionic, but, has, some, covalent, bonding, present, note, that, this, is, not, the, ionic, polarization, effect, that, refers, to, displacement, of, ions, in, the, lattice, due, to, the, application, of, an, electric, field, in, ionic, bonding, the, atoms, are, bound, by, attraction, of, oppositely, charged, ions, whereas, in, covalent, bonding, atoms, are, bound, by, sharing, electrons, to, attain, stable, electron, configurations, in, covalent, bonding, the, molecular, geometry, around, each, atom, is, determined, by, valence, shell, electron, pair, repulsion, vsepr, rules, whereas, in, ionic, materials, the, geometry, follows, maximum, packing, rules, one, could, say, that, covalent, bonding, is, more, directional, in, the, sense, that, the, energy, penalty, for, not, adhering, to, the, optimum, bond, angles, is, large, whereas, ionic, bonding, has, no, such, penalty, there, are, no, shared, electron, pairs, to, repel, each, other, the, ions, should, simply, be, packed, as, efficiently, as, possible, this, often, leads, to, much, higher, coordination, numbers, in, nacl, each, ion, has, 6, bonds, and, all, bond, angles, are, 90, in, cscl, the, coordination, number, is, 8, by, comparison, carbon, typically, has, a, maximum, of, four, bonds, purely, ionic, bonding, cannot, exist, as, the, proximity, of, the, entities, involved, in, the, bonding, allows, some, degree, of, sharing, electron, density, between, them, therefore, all, ionic, bonding, has, some, covalent, character, thus, bonding, is, considered, ionic, where, the, ionic, character, is, greater, than, the, covalent, character, the, larger, the, difference, in, electronegativity, between, the, two, types, of, atoms, involved, in, the, bonding, the, more, ionic, polar, it, is, bonds, with, partially, ionic, and, partially, covalent, character, are, called, polar, covalent, bonds, for, example, na, cl, and, mg, o, interactions, have, a, few, percent, covalency, while, si, o, bonds, are, usually, 50, ionic, and, 50, covalent, pauling, estimated, that, an, electronegativity, difference, of, 1, 7, on, the, pauling, scale, corresponds, to, 50, ionic, character, so, that, a, difference, greater, than, 1, 7, corresponds, to, a, bond, which, is, predominantly, ionic, ionic, character, in, covalent, bonds, can, be, directly, measured, for, atoms, having, quadrupolar, nuclei, 2, h, 14, n, 81, 79, br, 35, 37, cl, or, 127, i, these, nuclei, are, generally, objects, of, nqr, nuclear, quadrupole, resonance, and, nmr, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, studies, interactions, between, the, nuclear, quadrupole, moments, q, and, the, electric, field, gradients, efg, are, characterized, via, the, nuclear, quadrupole, coupling, constants, where, the, eq, zz, term, corresponds, to, the, principal, component, of, the, efg, tensor, and, e, is, the, elementary, charge, in, turn, the, electric, field, gradient, opens, the, way, to, description, of, bonding, modes, in, molecules, when, the, qcc, values, are, accurately, determined, by, nmr, or, nqr, methods, in, general, when, ionic, bonding, occurs, in, the, solid, or, liquid, state, it, is, not, possible, to, talk, about, a, single, ionic, bond, between, two, individual, atoms, because, the, cohesive, forces, that, keep, the, lattice, together, are, of, a, more, collective, nature, this, is, quite, different, in, the, case, of, covalent, bonding, where, we, can, often, speak, of, a, distinct, bond, localized, between, two, particular, atoms, however, even, if, ionic, bonding, is, combined, with, some, covalency, the, result, is, not, necessarily, discrete, bonds, of, a, localized, character, in, such, cases, the, resulting, bonding, often, requires, description, in, terms, of, a, band, structure, consisting, of, gigantic, molecular, orbitals, spanning, the, entire, crystal, thus, the, bonding, in, the, solid, often, retains, its, collective, rather, than, localized, nature, when, the, difference, in, electronegativity, is, decreased, the, bonding, may, then, lead, to, a, semiconductor, a, semimetal, or, eventually, a, metallic, conductor, with, metallic, bonding
