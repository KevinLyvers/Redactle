in, theoretical, physics, quantum, field, theory, qft, is, a, theoretical, framework, that, combines, classical, field, theory, special, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, xi, qft, is, used, in, particle, physics, to, construct, physical, models, of, subatomic, particles, and, in, condensed, matter, physics, to, construct, models, of, quasiparticles, the, current, standard, model, of, particle, physics, is, based, on, quantum, field, theory, qft, treats, particles, as, excited, states, also, called, quantum, levels, of, their, underlying, quantum, fields, which, are, more, fundamental, than, the, particles, the, equation, of, motion, of, the, particle, is, determined, by, minimization, of, the, action, computed, for, the, lagrangian, a, function, of, fields, associated, with, the, particle, interactions, between, particles, are, described, by, interaction, terms, in, the, lagrangian, involving, their, corresponding, quantum, fields, each, interaction, can, be, visually, represented, by, a, feynman, diagram, according, to, perturbation, theory, in, quantum, mechanics, quantum, field, theory, emerged, from, the, work, of, generations, of, theoretical, physicists, spanning, much, of, the, 20th, century, its, development, began, in, the, 1920s, with, the, description, of, interactions, between, light, and, electrons, culminating, in, the, first, quantum, field, theory, quantum, electrodynamics, a, major, theoretical, obstacle, soon, followed, with, the, appearance, and, persistence, of, various, infinities, in, perturbative, calculations, a, problem, only, resolved, in, the, 1950s, with, the, invention, of, the, renormalization, procedure, a, second, major, barrier, came, with, qft, s, apparent, inability, to, describe, the, weak, and, strong, interactions, to, the, point, where, some, theorists, called, for, the, abandonment, of, the, field, theoretic, approach, the, development, of, gauge, theory, and, the, completion, of, the, standard, model, in, the, 1970s, led, to, a, renaissance, of, quantum, field, theory, quantum, field, theory, results, from, the, combination, of, classical, field, theory, quantum, mechanics, and, special, relativity, xi, a, brief, overview, of, these, theoretical, precursors, follows, the, earliest, successful, classical, field, theory, is, one, that, emerged, from, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, despite, the, complete, absence, of, the, concept, of, fields, from, his, 1687, treatise, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, the, force, of, gravity, as, described, by, isaac, newton, is, an, action, at, a, distance, its, effects, on, faraway, objects, are, instantaneous, no, matter, the, distance, in, an, exchange, of, letters, with, richard, bentley, however, newton, stated, that, it, is, inconceivable, that, inanimate, brute, matter, should, without, the, mediation, of, something, else, which, is, not, material, operate, upon, and, affect, other, matter, without, mutual, contact, 4, it, was, not, until, the, 18th, century, that, mathematical, physicists, discovered, a, convenient, description, of, gravity, based, on, fields, a, numerical, quantity, a, vector, in, the, case, of, gravitational, field, assigned, to, every, point, in, space, indicating, the, action, of, gravity, on, any, particle, at, that, point, however, this, was, considered, merely, a, mathematical, trick, 18, fields, began, to, take, on, an, existence, of, their, own, with, the, development, of, electromagnetism, in, the, 19th, century, michael, faraday, coined, the, english, term, field, in, 1845, he, introduced, fields, as, properties, of, space, even, when, it, is, devoid, of, matter, having, physical, effects, he, argued, against, action, at, a, distance, and, proposed, that, interactions, between, objects, occur, via, space, filling, lines, of, force, this, description, of, fields, remains, to, this, day, 301, 2, the, theory, of, classical, electromagnetism, was, completed, in, 1864, with, maxwell, s, equations, which, described, the, relationship, between, the, electric, field, the, magnetic, field, electric, current, and, electric, charge, maxwell, s, equations, implied, the, existence, of, electromagnetic, waves, a, phenomenon, whereby, electric, and, magnetic, fields, propagate, from, one, spatial, point, to, another, at, a, finite, speed, which, turns, out, to, be, the, speed, of, light, action, at, a, distance, was, thus, conclusively, refuted, 19, despite, the, enormous, success, of, classical, electromagnetism, it, was, unable, to, account, for, the, discrete, lines, in, atomic, spectra, nor, for, the, distribution, of, blackbody, radiation, in, different, wavelengths, max, planck, s, study, of, blackbody, radiation, marked, the, beginning, of, quantum, mechanics, he, treated, atoms, which, absorb, and, emit, electromagnetic, radiation, as, tiny, oscillators, with, the, crucial, property, that, their, energies, can, only, take, on, a, series, of, discrete, rather, than, continuous, values, these, are, known, as, quantum, harmonic, oscillators, this, process, of, restricting, energies, to, discrete, values, is, called, quantization, ch, 2, building, on, this, idea, albert, einstein, proposed, in, 1905, an, explanation, for, the, photoelectric, effect, that, light, is, composed, of, individual, packets, of, energy, called, photons, the, quanta, of, light, this, implied, that, the, electromagnetic, radiation, while, being, waves, in, the, classical, electromagnetic, field, also, exists, in, the, form, of, particles, in, 1913, niels, bohr, introduced, the, bohr, model, of, atomic, structure, wherein, electrons, within, atoms, can, only, take, on, a, series, of, discrete, rather, than, continuous, energies, this, is, another, example, of, quantization, the, bohr, model, successfully, explained, the, discrete, nature, of, atomic, spectral, lines, in, 1924, louis, de, broglie, proposed, the, hypothesis, of, wave, particle, duality, that, microscopic, particles, exhibit, both, wave, like, and, particle, like, properties, under, different, circumstances, uniting, these, scattered, ideas, a, coherent, discipline, quantum, mechanics, was, formulated, between, 1925, and, 1926, with, important, contributions, from, max, planck, louis, de, broglie, werner, heisenberg, max, born, erwin, schr, dinger, paul, dirac, and, wolfgang, pauli, 22, 23, in, the, same, year, as, his, paper, on, the, photoelectric, effect, einstein, published, his, theory, of, special, relativity, built, on, maxwell, s, electromagnetism, new, rules, called, lorentz, transformations, were, given, for, the, way, time, and, space, coordinates, of, an, event, change, under, changes, in, the, observer, s, velocity, and, the, distinction, between, time, and, space, was, blurred, 19, it, was, proposed, that, all, physical, laws, must, be, the, same, for, observers, at, different, velocities, i, e, that, physical, laws, be, invariant, under, lorentz, transformations, two, difficulties, remained, observationally, the, schr, dinger, equation, underlying, quantum, mechanics, could, explain, the, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, from, atoms, where, an, electron, emits, a, new, photon, under, the, action, of, an, external, electromagnetic, field, but, it, was, unable, to, explain, spontaneous, emission, where, an, electron, spontaneously, decreases, in, energy, and, emits, a, photon, even, without, the, action, of, an, external, electromagnetic, field, theoretically, the, schr, dinger, equation, could, not, describe, photons, and, was, inconsistent, with, the, principles, of, special, relativity, it, treats, time, as, an, ordinary, number, while, promoting, spatial, coordinates, to, linear, operators, quantum, field, theory, naturally, began, with, the, study, of, electromagnetic, interactions, as, the, electromagnetic, field, was, the, only, known, classical, field, as, of, the, 1920s, 1, through, the, works, of, born, heisenberg, and, pascual, jordan, in, 1925, 1926, a, quantum, theory, of, the, free, electromagnetic, field, one, with, no, interactions, with, matter, was, developed, via, canonical, quantization, by, treating, the, electromagnetic, field, as, a, set, of, quantum, harmonic, oscillators, 1, with, the, exclusion, of, interactions, however, such, a, theory, was, yet, incapable, of, making, quantitative, predictions, about, the, real, world, 22, in, his, seminal, 1927, paper, the, quantum, theory, of, the, emission, and, absorption, of, radiation, dirac, coined, the, term, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, a, theory, that, adds, upon, the, terms, describing, the, free, electromagnetic, field, an, additional, interaction, term, between, electric, current, density, and, the, electromagnetic, vector, potential, using, first, order, perturbation, theory, he, successfully, explained, the, phenomenon, of, spontaneous, emission, according, to, the, uncertainty, principle, in, quantum, mechanics, quantum, harmonic, oscillators, cannot, remain, stationary, but, they, have, a, non, zero, minimum, energy, and, must, always, be, oscillating, even, in, the, lowest, energy, state, the, ground, state, therefore, even, in, a, perfect, vacuum, there, remains, an, oscillating, electromagnetic, field, having, zero, point, energy, it, is, this, quantum, fluctuation, of, electromagnetic, fields, in, the, vacuum, that, stimulates, the, spontaneous, emission, of, radiation, by, electrons, in, atoms, dirac, s, theory, was, hugely, successful, in, explaining, both, the, emission, and, absorption, of, radiation, by, atoms, by, applying, second, order, perturbation, theory, it, was, able, to, account, for, the, scattering, of, photons, resonance, fluorescence, and, non, relativistic, compton, scattering, nonetheless, the, application, of, higher, order, perturbation, theory, was, plagued, with, problematic, infinities, in, calculations, 71, in, 1928, dirac, wrote, down, a, wave, equation, that, described, relativistic, electrons, the, dirac, equation, it, had, the, following, important, consequences, the, spin, of, an, electron, is, 1, 2, the, electron, g, factor, is, 2, it, led, to, the, correct, sommerfeld, formula, for, the, fine, structure, of, the, hydrogen, atom, and, it, could, be, used, to, derive, the, klein, nishina, formula, for, relativistic, compton, scattering, although, the, results, were, fruitful, the, theory, also, apparently, implied, the, existence, of, negative, energy, states, which, would, cause, atoms, to, be, unstable, since, they, could, always, decay, to, lower, energy, states, by, the, emission, of, radiation, 71, 72, the, prevailing, view, at, the, time, was, that, the, world, was, composed, of, two, very, different, ingredients, material, particles, such, as, electrons, and, quantum, fields, such, as, photons, material, particles, were, considered, to, be, eternal, with, their, physical, state, described, by, the, probabilities, of, finding, each, particle, in, any, given, region, of, space, or, range, of, velocities, on, the, other, hand, photons, were, considered, merely, the, excited, states, of, the, underlying, quantized, electromagnetic, field, and, could, be, freely, created, or, destroyed, it, was, between, 1928, and, 1930, that, jordan, eugene, wigner, heisenberg, pauli, and, enrico, fermi, discovered, that, material, particles, could, also, be, seen, as, excited, states, of, quantum, fields, just, as, photons, are, excited, states, of, the, quantized, electromagnetic, field, so, each, type, of, particle, had, its, corresponding, quantum, field, an, electron, field, a, proton, field, etc, given, enough, energy, it, would, now, be, possible, to, create, material, particles, building, on, this, idea, fermi, proposed, in, 1932, an, explanation, for, beta, decay, known, as, fermi, s, interaction, atomic, nuclei, do, not, contain, electrons, per, se, but, in, the, process, of, decay, an, electron, is, created, out, of, the, surrounding, electron, field, analogous, to, the, photon, created, from, the, surrounding, electromagnetic, field, in, the, radiative, decay, of, an, excited, atom, 22, 23, it, was, realized, in, 1929, by, dirac, and, others, that, negative, energy, states, implied, by, the, dirac, equation, could, be, removed, by, assuming, the, existence, of, particles, with, the, same, mass, as, electrons, but, opposite, electric, charge, this, not, only, ensured, the, stability, of, atoms, but, it, was, also, the, first, proposal, of, the, existence, of, antimatter, indeed, the, evidence, for, positrons, was, discovered, in, 1932, by, carl, david, anderson, in, cosmic, rays, with, enough, energy, such, as, by, absorbing, a, photon, an, electron, positron, pair, could, be, created, a, process, called, pair, production, the, reverse, process, annihilation, could, also, occur, with, the, emission, of, a, photon, this, showed, that, particle, numbers, need, not, be, fixed, during, an, interaction, historically, however, positrons, were, at, first, thought, of, as, holes, in, an, infinite, electron, sea, rather, than, a, new, kind, of, particle, and, this, theory, was, referred, to, as, the, dirac, hole, theory, 72, 23, qft, naturally, incorporated, antiparticles, in, its, formalism, 24, robert, oppenheimer, showed, in, 1930, that, higher, order, perturbative, calculations, in, qed, always, resulted, in, infinite, quantities, such, as, the, electron, self, energy, and, the, vacuum, zero, point, energy, of, the, electron, and, photon, fields, suggesting, that, the, computational, methods, at, the, time, could, not, properly, deal, with, interactions, involving, photons, with, extremely, high, momenta, 25, it, was, not, until, 20, years, later, that, a, systematic, approach, to, remove, such, infinities, was, developed, a, series, of, papers, was, published, between, 1934, and, 1938, by, ernst, stueckelberg, that, established, a, relativistically, invariant, formulation, of, qft, in, 1947, stueckelberg, also, independently, developed, a, complete, renormalization, procedure, such, achievements, were, not, understood, and, recognized, by, the, theoretical, community, faced, with, these, infinities, john, archibald, wheeler, and, heisenberg, proposed, in, 1937, and, 1943, respectively, to, supplant, the, problematic, qft, with, the, so, called, s, matrix, theory, since, the, specific, details, of, microscopic, interactions, are, inaccessible, to, observations, the, theory, should, only, attempt, to, describe, the, relationships, between, a, small, number, of, observables, e, g, the, energy, of, an, atom, in, an, interaction, rather, than, be, concerned, with, the, microscopic, minutiae, of, the, interaction, in, 1945, richard, feynman, and, wheeler, daringly, suggested, abandoning, qft, altogether, and, proposed, action, at, a, distance, as, the, mechanism, of, particle, interactions, 26, in, 1947, willis, lamb, and, robert, retherford, measured, the, minute, difference, in, the, 2, s, 1, 2, and, 2, p, 1, 2, energy, levels, of, the, hydrogen, atom, also, called, the, lamb, shift, by, ignoring, the, contribution, of, photons, whose, energy, exceeds, the, electron, mass, hans, bethe, successfully, estimated, the, numerical, value, of, the, lamb, shift, 28, subsequently, norman, myles, kroll, lamb, james, bruce, french, and, victor, weisskopf, again, confirmed, this, value, using, an, approach, in, which, infinities, cancelled, other, infinities, to, result, in, finite, quantities, however, this, method, was, clumsy, and, unreliable, and, could, not, be, generalized, to, other, calculations, the, breakthrough, eventually, came, around, 1950, when, a, more, robust, method, for, eliminating, infinities, was, developed, by, julian, schwinger, richard, feynman, freeman, dyson, and, shinichiro, tomonaga, the, main, idea, is, to, replace, the, calculated, values, of, mass, and, charge, infinite, though, they, may, be, by, their, finite, measured, values, this, systematic, computational, procedure, is, known, as, renormalization, and, can, be, applied, to, arbitrary, order, in, perturbation, theory, as, tomonaga, said, in, his, nobel, lecture, since, those, parts, of, the, modified, mass, and, charge, due, to, field, reactions, it, is, impossible, to, calculate, them, by, the, theory, however, the, mass, and, charge, observed, in, experiments, are, not, the, original, mass, and, charge, but, the, mass, and, charge, as, modified, by, field, reactions, and, they, are, finite, on, the, other, hand, the, mass, and, charge, appearing, in, the, theory, are, the, values, modified, by, field, reactions, since, this, is, so, and, particularly, since, the, theory, is, unable, to, calculate, the, modified, mass, and, charge, we, may, adopt, the, procedure, of, substituting, experimental, values, for, them, phenomenologically, this, procedure, is, called, the, renormalization, of, mass, and, charge, after, long, laborious, calculations, less, skillful, than, schwinger, s, we, obtained, a, result, which, was, in, agreement, with, americans, by, applying, the, renormalization, procedure, calculations, were, finally, made, to, explain, the, electron, s, anomalous, magnetic, moment, the, deviation, of, the, electron, g, factor, from, 2, and, vacuum, polarization, these, results, agreed, with, experimental, measurements, to, a, remarkable, degree, thus, marking, the, end, of, a, war, against, infinities, at, the, same, time, feynman, introduced, the, path, integral, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, feynman, diagrams, 2, the, latter, can, be, used, to, visually, and, intuitively, organize, and, to, help, compute, terms, in, the, perturbative, expansion, each, diagram, can, be, interpreted, as, paths, of, particles, in, an, interaction, with, each, vertex, and, line, having, a, corresponding, mathematical, expression, and, the, product, of, these, expressions, gives, the, scattering, amplitude, of, the, interaction, represented, by, the, diagram, 5, it, was, with, the, invention, of, the, renormalization, procedure, and, feynman, diagrams, that, qft, finally, arose, as, a, complete, theoretical, framework, 2, given, the, tremendous, success, of, qed, many, theorists, believed, in, the, few, years, after, 1949, that, qft, could, soon, provide, an, understanding, of, all, microscopic, phenomena, not, only, the, interactions, between, photons, electrons, and, positrons, contrary, to, this, optimism, qft, entered, yet, another, period, of, depression, that, lasted, for, almost, two, decades, 30, the, first, obstacle, was, the, limited, applicability, of, the, renormalization, procedure, in, perturbative, calculations, in, qed, all, infinite, quantities, could, be, eliminated, by, redefining, a, small, finite, number, of, physical, quantities, namely, the, mass, and, charge, of, the, electron, dyson, proved, in, 1949, that, this, is, only, possible, for, a, small, class, of, theories, called, renormalizable, theories, of, which, qed, is, an, example, however, most, theories, including, the, fermi, theory, of, the, weak, interaction, are, non, renormalizable, any, perturbative, calculation, in, these, theories, beyond, the, first, order, would, result, in, infinities, that, could, not, be, removed, by, redefining, a, finite, number, of, physical, quantities, 30, the, second, major, problem, stemmed, from, the, limited, validity, of, the, feynman, diagram, method, which, is, based, on, a, series, expansion, in, perturbation, theory, in, order, for, the, series, to, converge, and, low, order, calculations, to, be, a, good, approximation, the, coupling, constant, in, which, the, series, is, expanded, must, be, a, sufficiently, small, number, the, coupling, constant, in, qed, is, the, fine, structure, constant, 1, 137, which, is, small, enough, that, only, the, simplest, lowest, order, feynman, diagrams, need, to, be, considered, in, realistic, calculations, in, contrast, the, coupling, constant, in, the, strong, interaction, is, roughly, of, the, order, of, one, making, complicated, higher, order, feynman, diagrams, just, as, important, as, simple, ones, there, was, thus, no, way, of, deriving, reliable, quantitative, predictions, for, the, strong, interaction, using, perturbative, qft, methods, 31, with, these, difficulties, looming, many, theorists, began, to, turn, away, from, qft, some, focused, on, symmetry, principles, and, conservation, laws, while, others, picked, up, the, old, s, matrix, theory, of, wheeler, and, heisenberg, qft, was, used, heuristically, as, guiding, principles, but, not, as, a, basis, for, quantitative, calculations, 31, schwinger, however, took, a, different, route, for, more, than, a, decade, he, and, his, students, had, been, nearly, the, only, exponents, of, field, theory, but, in, 1951, he, found, a, way, around, the, problem, of, the, infinities, with, a, new, method, using, external, sources, as, currents, coupled, to, gauge, fields, motivated, by, the, former, findings, schwinger, kept, pursuing, this, approach, in, order, to, quantumly, generalize, the, classical, process, of, coupling, external, forces, to, the, configuration, space, parameters, known, as, lagrange, multipliers, he, summarized, his, source, theory, in, 1966, then, expanded, the, theory, s, applications, to, quantum, electrodynamics, in, his, three, volume, set, titled, particles, sources, and, fields, developments, in, pion, physics, in, which, the, new, viewpoint, was, most, successfully, applied, convinced, him, of, the, great, advantages, of, mathematical, simplicity, and, conceptual, clarity, that, its, use, bestowed, in, source, theory, there, are, no, divergences, and, no, renormalization, it, may, be, regarded, as, the, calculational, tool, of, field, theory, but, it, is, more, general, using, source, theory, schwinger, was, able, to, calculate, the, anomalous, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, which, he, had, done, in, 1947, but, this, time, with, no, distracting, remarks, about, infinite, quantities, schwinger, also, applied, source, theory, to, his, qft, theory, of, gravity, and, was, able, to, reproduce, all, four, of, einstein, s, classic, results, gravitational, red, shift, deflection, and, slowing, of, light, by, gravity, and, the, perihelion, precession, of, mercury, the, neglect, of, source, theory, by, the, physics, community, was, a, major, disappointment, for, schwinger, the, lack, of, appreciation, of, these, facts, by, others, was, depressing, but, understandable, j, schwinger, see, the, shoes, incident, between, j, schwinger, and, s, weinberg, in, 1954, yang, chen, ning, and, robert, mills, generalized, the, local, symmetry, of, qed, leading, to, non, abelian, gauge, theories, also, known, as, yang, mills, theories, which, are, based, on, more, complicated, local, symmetry, groups, 5, in, qed, electrically, charged, particles, interact, via, the, exchange, of, photons, while, in, non, abelian, gauge, theory, particles, carrying, a, new, type, of, charge, interact, via, the, exchange, of, massless, gauge, bosons, unlike, photons, these, gauge, bosons, themselves, carry, charge, 32, sheldon, glashow, developed, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, that, unified, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, in, 1960, in, 1964, abdus, salam, and, john, clive, ward, arrived, at, the, same, theory, through, a, different, path, this, theory, nevertheless, was, non, renormalizable, peter, higgs, robert, brout, fran, ois, englert, gerald, guralnik, carl, hagen, and, tom, kibble, proposed, in, their, famous, physical, review, letters, papers, that, the, gauge, symmetry, in, yang, mills, theories, could, be, broken, by, a, mechanism, called, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, through, which, originally, massless, gauge, bosons, could, acquire, mass, 5, 6, by, combining, the, earlier, theory, of, glashow, salam, and, ward, with, the, idea, of, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, steven, weinberg, wrote, down, in, 1967, a, theory, describing, electroweak, interactions, between, all, leptons, and, the, effects, of, the, higgs, boson, his, theory, was, at, first, mostly, ignored, 6, until, it, was, brought, back, to, light, in, 1971, by, gerard, t, hooft, s, proof, that, non, abelian, gauge, theories, are, renormalizable, the, electroweak, theory, of, weinberg, and, salam, was, extended, from, leptons, to, quarks, in, 1970, by, glashow, john, iliopoulos, and, luciano, maiani, marking, its, completion, harald, fritzsch, murray, gell, mann, and, heinrich, leutwyler, discovered, in, 1971, that, certain, phenomena, involving, the, strong, interaction, could, also, be, explained, by, non, abelian, gauge, theory, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, was, born, in, 1973, david, gross, frank, wilczek, and, hugh, david, politzer, showed, that, non, abelian, gauge, theories, are, asymptotically, free, meaning, that, under, renormalization, the, coupling, constant, of, the, strong, interaction, decreases, as, the, interaction, energy, increases, similar, discoveries, had, been, made, numerous, times, previously, but, they, had, been, largely, ignored, 11, therefore, at, least, in, high, energy, interactions, the, coupling, constant, in, qcd, becomes, sufficiently, small, to, warrant, a, perturbative, series, expansion, making, quantitative, predictions, for, the, strong, interaction, possible, 32, these, theoretical, breakthroughs, brought, about, a, renaissance, in, qft, the, full, theory, which, includes, the, electroweak, theory, and, chromodynamics, is, referred, to, today, as, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particles, the, standard, model, successfully, describes, all, fundamental, interactions, except, gravity, and, its, many, predictions, have, been, met, with, remarkable, experimental, confirmation, in, subsequent, decades, 3, the, higgs, boson, central, to, the, mechanism, of, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, was, finally, detected, in, 2012, at, cern, marking, the, complete, verification, of, the, existence, of, all, constituents, of, the, standard, model, the, 1970s, saw, the, development, of, non, perturbative, methods, in, non, abelian, gauge, theories, the, t, hooft, polyakov, monopole, was, discovered, theoretically, by, t, hooft, and, alexander, polyakov, flux, tubes, by, holger, bech, nielsen, and, poul, olesen, and, instantons, by, polyakov, and, coauthors, these, objects, are, inaccessible, through, perturbation, theory, 4, supersymmetry, also, appeared, in, the, same, period, the, first, supersymmetric, qft, in, four, dimensions, was, built, by, yuri, golfand, and, evgeny, likhtman, in, 1970, but, their, result, failed, to, garner, widespread, interest, due, to, the, iron, curtain, supersymmetry, only, took, off, in, the, theoretical, community, after, the, work, of, julius, wess, and, bruno, zumino, in, 1973, 7, among, the, four, fundamental, interactions, gravity, remains, the, only, one, that, lacks, a, consistent, qft, description, various, attempts, at, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, led, to, the, development, of, string, theory, 6, itself, a, type, of, two, dimensional, qft, with, conformal, symmetry, jo, l, scherk, and, john, schwarz, first, proposed, in, 1974, that, string, theory, could, be, the, quantum, theory, of, gravity, although, quantum, field, theory, arose, from, the, study, of, interactions, between, elementary, particles, it, has, been, successfully, applied, to, other, physical, systems, particularly, to, many, body, systems, in, condensed, matter, physics, historically, the, higgs, mechanism, of, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, was, a, result, of, yoichiro, nambu, s, application, of, superconductor, theory, to, elementary, particles, while, the, concept, of, renormalization, came, out, of, the, study, of, second, order, phase, transitions, in, matter, soon, after, the, introduction, of, photons, einstein, performed, the, quantization, procedure, on, vibrations, in, a, crystal, leading, to, the, first, quasiparticle, phonons, lev, landau, claimed, that, low, energy, excitations, in, many, condensed, matter, systems, could, be, described, in, terms, of, interactions, between, a, set, of, quasiparticles, the, feynman, diagram, method, of, qft, was, naturally, well, suited, to, the, analysis, of, various, phenomena, in, condensed, matter, systems, gauge, theory, is, used, to, describe, the, quantization, of, magnetic, flux, in, superconductors, the, resistivity, in, the, quantum, hall, effect, as, well, as, the, relation, between, frequency, and, voltage, in, the, ac, josephson, effect, for, simplicity, natural, units, are, used, in, the, following, sections, in, which, the, reduced, planck, constant, and, the, speed, of, light, c, are, both, set, to, one, a, classical, field, is, a, function, of, spatial, and, time, coordinates, examples, include, the, gravitational, field, in, newtonian, gravity, g, x, t, and, the, electric, field, e, x, t, and, magnetic, field, b, x, t, in, classical, electromagnetism, a, classical, field, can, be, thought, of, as, a, numerical, quantity, assigned, to, every, point, in, space, that, changes, in, time, hence, it, has, infinitely, many, degrees, of, freedom, many, phenomena, exhibiting, quantum, mechanical, properties, cannot, be, explained, by, classical, fields, alone, phenomena, such, as, the, photoelectric, effect, are, best, explained, by, discrete, particles, photons, rather, than, a, spatially, continuous, field, the, goal, of, quantum, field, theory, is, to, describe, various, quantum, mechanical, phenomena, using, a, modified, concept, of, fields, canonical, quantization, and, path, integrals, are, two, common, formulations, of, qft, 61, to, motivate, the, fundamentals, of, qft, an, overview, of, classical, field, theory, follows, the, simplest, classical, field, is, a, real, scalar, field, a, real, number, at, every, point, in, space, that, changes, in, time, it, is, denoted, as, x, t, where, x, is, the, position, vector, and, t, is, the, time, suppose, the, lagrangian, of, the, field, l, displaystyle, l, is, where, l, displaystyle, mathcal, l, is, the, lagrangian, density, displaystyle, dot, phi, is, the, time, derivative, of, the, field, is, the, gradient, operator, and, m, is, a, real, parameter, the, mass, of, the, field, applying, the, euler, lagrange, equation, on, the, lagrangian, 16, we, obtain, the, equations, of, motion, for, the, field, which, describe, the, way, it, varies, in, time, and, space, this, is, known, as, the, klein, gordon, equation, 17, the, klein, gordon, equation, is, a, wave, equation, so, its, solutions, can, be, expressed, as, a, sum, of, normal, modes, obtained, via, fourier, transform, as, follows, where, a, is, a, complex, number, normalized, by, convention, denotes, complex, conjugation, and, p, is, the, frequency, of, the, normal, mode, thus, each, normal, mode, corresponding, to, a, single, p, can, be, seen, as, a, classical, harmonic, oscillator, with, frequency, p, 21, 26, the, quantization, procedure, for, the, above, classical, field, to, a, quantum, operator, field, is, analogous, to, the, promotion, of, a, classical, harmonic, oscillator, to, a, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, the, displacement, of, a, classical, harmonic, oscillator, is, described, by, where, a, is, a, complex, number, normalized, by, convention, and, is, the, oscillator, s, frequency, note, that, x, is, the, displacement, of, a, particle, in, simple, harmonic, motion, from, the, equilibrium, position, not, to, be, confused, with, the, spatial, label, x, of, a, quantum, field, for, a, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, x, t, is, promoted, to, a, linear, operator, x, t, displaystyle, hat, x, t, complex, numbers, a, and, a, are, replaced, by, the, annihilation, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, and, the, creation, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, dagger, respectively, where, denotes, hermitian, conjugation, the, commutation, relation, between, the, two, is, the, hamiltonian, of, the, simple, harmonic, oscillator, can, be, written, as, the, vacuum, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, which, is, the, lowest, energy, state, is, defined, by, and, has, energy, 1, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, 2, hbar, omega, one, can, easily, check, that, h, a, a, displaystyle, hbar, omega, hat, a, dagger, which, implies, that, a, displaystyle, hat, a, dagger, increases, the, energy, of, the, simple, harmonic, oscillator, by, displaystyle, hbar, omega, for, example, the, state, a, 0, displaystyle, hat, a, dagger, 0, rangle, is, an, eigenstate, of, energy, 3, 2, displaystyle, 3, hbar, omega, 2, any, energy, eigenstate, state, of, a, single, harmonic, oscillator, can, be, obtained, from, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, by, successively, applying, the, creation, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, dagger, 20, and, any, state, of, the, system, can, be, expressed, as, a, linear, combination, of, the, states, a, similar, procedure, can, be, applied, to, the, real, scalar, field, by, promoting, it, to, a, quantum, field, operator, displaystyle, hat, phi, while, the, annihilation, operator, a, p, displaystyle, hat, a, mathbf, p, the, creation, operator, a, p, displaystyle, hat, a, mathbf, p, dagger, and, the, angular, frequency, p, displaystyle, omega, mathbf, p, are, now, for, a, particular, p, their, commutation, relations, are, 21, where, is, the, dirac, delta, function, the, vacuum, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, is, defined, by, any, quantum, state, of, the, field, can, be, obtained, from, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, by, successively, applying, creation, operators, a, p, displaystyle, hat, a, mathbf, p, dagger, or, by, a, linear, combination, of, such, states, e, g, 22, while, the, state, space, of, a, single, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, contains, all, the, discrete, energy, states, of, one, oscillating, particle, the, state, space, of, a, quantum, field, contains, the, discrete, energy, levels, of, an, arbitrary, number, of, particles, the, latter, space, is, known, as, a, fock, space, which, can, account, for, the, fact, that, particle, numbers, are, not, fixed, in, relativistic, quantum, systems, the, process, of, quantizing, an, arbitrary, number, of, particles, instead, of, a, single, particle, is, often, also, called, second, quantization, 19, the, foregoing, procedure, is, a, direct, application, of, non, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, and, can, be, used, to, quantize, complex, scalar, fields, dirac, fields, 52, vector, fields, e, g, the, electromagnetic, field, and, even, strings, however, creation, and, annihilation, operators, are, only, well, defined, in, the, simplest, theories, that, contain, no, interactions, so, called, free, theory, in, the, case, of, the, real, scalar, field, the, existence, of, these, operators, was, a, consequence, of, the, decomposition, of, solutions, of, the, classical, equations, of, motion, into, a, sum, of, normal, modes, to, perform, calculations, on, any, realistic, interacting, theory, perturbation, theory, would, be, necessary, the, lagrangian, of, any, quantum, field, in, nature, would, contain, interaction, terms, in, addition, to, the, free, theory, terms, for, example, a, quartic, interaction, term, could, be, introduced, to, the, lagrangian, of, the, real, scalar, field, 77, where, is, a, spacetime, index, 0, t, 1, x, 1, displaystyle, partial, 0, partial, partial, t, partial, 1, partial, partial, x, 1, etc, the, summation, over, the, index, has, been, omitted, following, the, einstein, notation, if, the, parameter, is, sufficiently, small, then, the, interacting, theory, described, by, the, above, lagrangian, can, be, considered, as, a, small, perturbation, from, the, free, theory, the, path, integral, formulation, of, qft, is, concerned, with, the, direct, computation, of, the, scattering, amplitude, of, a, certain, interaction, process, rather, than, the, establishment, of, operators, and, state, spaces, to, calculate, the, probability, amplitude, for, a, system, to, evolve, from, some, initial, state, i, displaystyle, phi, i, rangle, at, time, t, 0, to, some, final, state, f, displaystyle, phi, f, rangle, at, t, t, the, total, time, t, is, divided, into, n, small, intervals, the, overall, amplitude, is, the, product, of, the, amplitude, of, evolution, within, each, interval, integrated, over, all, intermediate, states, let, h, be, the, hamiltonian, i, e, generator, of, time, evolution, then, 10, taking, the, limit, n, the, above, product, of, integrals, becomes, the, feynman, path, integral, 282, 12, where, l, is, the, lagrangian, involving, and, its, derivatives, with, respect, to, spatial, and, time, coordinates, obtained, from, the, hamiltonian, h, via, legendre, transformation, the, initial, and, final, conditions, of, the, path, integral, are, respectively, in, other, words, the, overall, amplitude, is, the, sum, over, the, amplitude, of, every, possible, path, between, the, initial, and, final, states, where, the, amplitude, of, a, path, is, given, by, the, exponential, in, the, integrand, in, calculations, one, often, encounters, expression, like, 0, t, x, y, 0, or, t, x, y, displaystyle, langle, 0, t, phi, x, phi, y, 0, rangle, quad, text, or, quad, langle, omega, t, phi, x, phi, y, omega, rangle, in, the, free, or, interacting, theory, respectively, here, x, displaystyle, x, and, y, displaystyle, y, are, position, four, vectors, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, time, ordering, operator, that, shuffles, its, operands, so, the, time, components, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, and, y, 0, displaystyle, y, 0, increase, from, right, to, left, and, displaystyle, omega, rangle, is, the, ground, state, vacuum, state, of, the, interacting, theory, different, from, the, free, ground, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, this, expression, represents, the, probability, amplitude, for, the, field, to, propagate, from, y, to, x, and, goes, by, multiple, names, like, the, two, point, propagator, two, point, correlation, function, two, point, green, s, function, or, two, point, function, for, short, 82, the, free, two, point, function, also, known, as, the, feynman, propagator, can, be, found, for, the, real, scalar, field, by, either, canonical, quantization, or, path, integrals, to, be, 31, 288, 23, in, an, interacting, theory, where, the, lagrangian, or, hamiltonian, contains, terms, l, i, t, displaystyle, l, i, t, or, h, i, t, displaystyle, h, i, t, that, describe, interactions, the, two, point, function, is, more, difficult, to, define, however, through, both, the, canonical, quantization, formulation, and, the, path, integral, formulation, it, is, possible, to, express, it, through, an, infinite, perturbation, series, of, the, free, two, point, function, in, canonical, quantization, the, two, point, correlation, function, can, be, written, as, 87, where, is, an, infinitesimal, number, and, i, is, the, field, operator, under, the, free, theory, here, the, exponential, should, be, understood, as, its, power, series, expansion, for, example, in, 4, displaystyle, phi, 4, theory, the, interacting, term, of, the, hamiltonian, is, h, i, t, d, 3, x, 4, i, x, 4, textstyle, h, i, t, int, d, 3, x, frac, lambda, 4, phi, i, x, 4, 84, and, the, expansion, of, the, two, point, correlator, in, terms, of, displaystyle, lambda, becomes, t, x, y, n, 0, i, n, 4, n, n, d, 4, z, 1, d, 4, z, n, 0, t, i, x, i, y, i, z, 1, 4, i, z, n, 4, 0, n, 0, i, n, 4, n, n, d, 4, z, 1, d, 4, z, n, 0, t, i, z, 1, 4, i, z, n, 4, 0, displaystyle, langle, omega, t, phi, x, phi, y, omega, rangle, frac, displaystyle, sum, n, 0, infty, frac, i, lambda, n, 4, n, n, int, d, 4, z, 1, cdots, int, d, 4, z, n, langle, 0, t, phi, i, x, phi, i, y, phi, i, z, 1, 4, cdots, phi, i, z, n, 4, 0, rangle, displaystyle, sum, n, 0, infty, frac, i, lambda, n, 4, n, n, int, d, 4, z, 1, cdots, int, d, 4, z, n, langle, 0, t, phi, i, z, 1, 4, cdots, phi, i, z, n, 4, 0, rangle, this, perturbation, expansion, expresses, the, interacting, two, point, function, in, terms, of, quantities, 0, 0, displaystyle, langle, 0, cdots, 0, rangle, that, are, evaluated, in, the, free, theory, in, the, path, integral, formulation, the, two, point, correlation, function, can, be, written, 284, where, l, displaystyle, mathcal, l, is, the, lagrangian, density, as, in, the, previous, paragraph, the, exponential, can, be, expanded, as, a, series, in, reducing, the, interacting, two, point, function, to, quantities, in, the, free, theory, wick, s, theorem, further, reduce, any, n, point, correlation, function, in, the, free, theory, to, a, sum, of, products, of, two, point, correlation, functions, for, example, since, interacting, correlation, functions, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, free, correlation, functions, only, the, latter, need, to, be, evaluated, in, order, to, calculate, all, physical, quantities, in, the, perturbative, interacting, theory, 90, this, makes, the, feynman, propagator, one, of, the, most, important, quantities, in, quantum, field, theory, correlation, functions, in, the, interacting, theory, can, be, written, as, a, perturbation, series, each, term, in, the, series, is, a, product, of, feynman, propagators, in, the, free, theory, and, can, be, represented, visually, by, a, feynman, diagram, for, example, the, 1, term, in, the, two, point, correlation, function, in, the, 4, theory, is, after, applying, wick, s, theorem, one, of, the, terms, is, this, term, can, instead, be, obtained, from, the, feynman, diagram, the, diagram, consists, of, every, vertex, corresponds, to, a, single, displaystyle, phi, field, factor, at, the, corresponding, point, in, spacetime, while, the, edges, correspond, to, the, propagators, between, the, spacetime, points, the, term, in, the, perturbation, series, corresponding, to, the, diagram, is, obtained, by, writing, down, the, expression, that, follows, from, the, so, called, feynman, rules, with, the, symmetry, factor, 2, displaystyle, 2, following, these, rules, yields, exactly, the, expression, above, by, fourier, transforming, the, propagator, the, feynman, rules, can, be, reformulated, from, position, space, into, momentum, space, 91, 94, in, order, to, compute, the, n, point, correlation, function, to, the, k, th, order, list, all, valid, feynman, diagrams, with, n, external, points, and, k, or, fewer, vertices, and, then, use, feynman, rules, to, obtain, the, expression, for, each, term, to, be, precise, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, expressions, corresponding, to, all, connected, diagrams, with, n, external, points, connected, diagrams, are, those, in, which, every, vertex, is, connected, to, an, external, point, through, lines, components, that, are, totally, disconnected, from, external, lines, are, sometimes, called, vacuum, bubbles, in, the, 4, interaction, theory, discussed, above, every, vertex, must, have, four, legs, 98, in, realistic, applications, the, scattering, amplitude, of, a, certain, interaction, or, the, decay, rate, of, a, particle, can, be, computed, from, the, s, matrix, which, itself, can, be, found, using, the, feynman, diagram, method, 102, 115, feynman, diagrams, devoid, of, loops, are, called, tree, level, diagrams, which, describe, the, lowest, order, interaction, processes, those, containing, n, loops, are, referred, to, as, n, loop, diagrams, which, describe, higher, order, contributions, or, radiative, corrections, to, the, interaction, 44, lines, whose, end, points, are, vertices, can, be, thought, of, as, the, propagation, of, virtual, particles, 31, feynman, rules, can, be, used, to, directly, evaluate, tree, level, diagrams, however, na, ve, computation, of, loop, diagrams, such, as, the, one, shown, above, will, result, in, divergent, momentum, integrals, which, seems, to, imply, that, almost, all, terms, in, the, perturbative, expansion, are, infinite, the, renormalisation, procedure, is, a, systematic, process, for, removing, such, infinities, parameters, appearing, in, the, lagrangian, such, as, the, mass, m, and, the, coupling, constant, have, no, physical, meaning, m, and, the, field, strength, are, not, experimentally, measurable, quantities, and, are, referred, to, here, as, the, bare, mass, bare, coupling, constant, and, bare, field, respectively, the, physical, mass, and, coupling, constant, are, measured, in, some, interaction, process, and, are, generally, different, from, the, bare, quantities, while, computing, physical, quantities, from, this, interaction, process, one, may, limit, the, domain, of, divergent, momentum, integrals, to, be, below, some, momentum, cut, off, obtain, expressions, for, the, physical, quantities, and, then, take, the, limit, this, is, an, example, of, regularization, a, class, of, methods, to, treat, divergences, in, qft, with, being, the, regulator, the, approach, illustrated, above, is, called, bare, perturbation, theory, as, calculations, involve, only, the, bare, quantities, such, as, mass, and, coupling, constant, a, different, approach, called, renormalized, perturbation, theory, is, to, use, physically, meaningful, quantities, from, the, very, beginning, in, the, case, of, 4, theory, the, field, strength, is, first, redefined, where, is, the, bare, field, r, is, the, renormalized, field, and, z, is, a, constant, to, be, determined, the, lagrangian, density, becomes, where, m, r, and, r, are, the, experimentally, measurable, renormalized, mass, and, coupling, constant, respectively, and, are, constants, to, be, determined, the, first, three, terms, are, the, 4, lagrangian, density, written, in, terms, of, the, renormalized, quantities, while, the, latter, three, terms, are, referred, to, as, counterterms, as, the, lagrangian, now, contains, more, terms, so, the, feynman, diagrams, should, include, additional, elements, each, with, their, own, feynman, rules, the, procedure, is, outlined, as, follows, first, select, a, regularization, scheme, such, as, the, cut, off, regularization, introduced, above, or, dimensional, regularization, call, the, regulator, compute, feynman, diagrams, in, which, divergent, terms, will, depend, on, then, define, z, m, and, such, that, feynman, diagrams, for, the, counterterms, will, exactly, cancel, the, divergent, terms, in, the, normal, feynman, diagrams, when, the, limit, is, taken, in, this, way, meaningful, finite, quantities, are, obtained, 323, 326, it, is, only, possible, to, eliminate, all, infinities, to, obtain, a, finite, result, in, renormalizable, theories, whereas, in, non, renormalizable, theories, infinities, cannot, be, removed, by, the, redefinition, of, a, small, number, of, parameters, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particles, is, a, renormalizable, qft, 719, 727, while, quantum, gravity, is, non, renormalizable, 798, 421, the, renormalization, group, developed, by, kenneth, wilson, is, a, mathematical, apparatus, used, to, study, the, changes, in, physical, parameters, coefficients, in, the, lagrangian, as, the, system, is, viewed, at, different, scales, 393, the, way, in, which, each, parameter, changes, with, scale, is, described, by, its, function, 417, correlation, functions, which, underlie, quantitative, physical, predictions, change, with, scale, according, to, the, callan, symanzik, equation, 410, 411, as, an, example, the, coupling, constant, in, qed, namely, the, elementary, charge, e, has, the, following, function, where, is, the, energy, scale, under, which, the, measurement, of, e, is, performed, this, differential, equation, implies, that, the, observed, elementary, charge, increases, as, the, scale, increases, the, renormalized, coupling, constant, which, changes, with, the, energy, scale, is, also, called, the, running, coupling, constant, 420, the, coupling, constant, g, in, quantum, chromodynamics, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, based, on, the, symmetry, group, su, 3, has, the, following, function, where, n, f, is, the, number, of, quark, flavours, in, the, case, where, n, f, 16, the, standard, model, has, n, f, 6, the, coupling, constant, g, decreases, as, the, energy, scale, increases, hence, while, the, strong, interaction, is, strong, at, low, energies, it, becomes, very, weak, in, high, energy, interactions, a, phenomenon, known, as, asymptotic, freedom, 531, conformal, field, theories, cfts, are, special, qfts, that, admit, conformal, symmetry, they, are, insensitive, to, changes, in, the, scale, as, all, their, coupling, constants, have, vanishing, function, the, converse, is, not, true, however, the, vanishing, of, all, functions, does, not, imply, conformal, symmetry, of, the, theory, examples, include, string, theory, and, n, 4, supersymmetric, yang, mills, theory, according, to, wilson, s, picture, every, qft, is, fundamentally, accompanied, by, its, energy, cut, off, i, e, that, the, theory, is, no, longer, valid, at, energies, higher, than, and, all, degrees, of, freedom, above, the, scale, are, to, be, omitted, for, example, the, cut, off, could, be, the, inverse, of, the, atomic, spacing, in, a, condensed, matter, system, and, in, elementary, particle, physics, it, could, be, associated, with, the, fundamental, graininess, of, spacetime, caused, by, quantum, fluctuations, in, gravity, the, cut, off, scale, of, theories, of, particle, interactions, lies, far, beyond, current, experiments, even, if, the, theory, were, very, complicated, at, that, scale, as, long, as, its, couplings, are, sufficiently, weak, it, must, be, described, at, low, energies, by, a, renormalizable, effective, field, theory, 402, 403, the, difference, between, renormalizable, and, non, renormalizable, theories, is, that, the, former, are, insensitive, to, details, at, high, energies, whereas, the, latter, do, depend, on, them, 2, according, to, this, view, non, renormalizable, theories, are, to, be, seen, as, low, energy, effective, theories, of, a, more, fundamental, theory, the, failure, to, remove, the, cut, off, from, calculations, in, such, a, theory, merely, indicates, that, new, physical, phenomena, appear, at, scales, above, where, a, new, theory, is, necessary, 156, the, quantization, and, renormalization, procedures, outlined, in, the, preceding, sections, are, performed, for, the, free, theory, and, 4, theory, of, the, real, scalar, field, a, similar, process, can, be, done, for, other, types, of, fields, including, the, complex, scalar, field, the, vector, field, and, the, dirac, field, as, well, as, other, types, of, interaction, terms, including, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, the, yukawa, interaction, as, an, example, quantum, electrodynamics, contains, a, dirac, field, representing, the, electron, field, and, a, vector, field, a, representing, the, electromagnetic, field, photon, field, despite, its, name, the, quantum, electromagnetic, field, actually, corresponds, to, the, classical, electromagnetic, four, potential, rather, than, the, classical, electric, and, magnetic, fields, the, full, qed, lagrangian, density, is, where, are, dirac, matrices, 0, displaystyle, bar, psi, psi, dagger, gamma, 0, and, f, a, a, displaystyle, f, mu, nu, partial, mu, a, nu, partial, nu, a, mu, is, the, electromagnetic, field, strength, the, parameters, in, this, theory, are, the, bare, electron, mass, m, and, the, bare, elementary, charge, e, the, first, and, second, terms, in, the, lagrangian, density, correspond, to, the, free, dirac, field, and, free, vector, fields, respectively, the, last, term, describes, the, interaction, between, the, electron, and, photon, fields, which, is, treated, as, a, perturbation, from, the, free, theories, 78, shown, above, is, an, example, of, a, tree, level, feynman, diagram, in, qed, it, describes, an, electron, and, a, positron, annihilating, creating, an, off, shell, photon, and, then, decaying, into, a, new, pair, of, electron, and, positron, time, runs, from, left, to, right, arrows, pointing, forward, in, time, represent, the, propagation, of, electrons, while, those, pointing, backward, in, time, represent, the, propagation, of, positrons, a, wavy, line, represents, the, propagation, of, a, photon, each, vertex, in, qed, feynman, diagrams, must, have, an, incoming, and, an, outgoing, fermion, positron, electron, leg, as, well, as, a, photon, leg, if, the, following, transformation, to, the, fields, is, performed, at, every, spacetime, point, x, a, local, transformation, then, the, qed, lagrangian, remains, unchanged, or, invariant, where, x, is, any, function, of, spacetime, coordinates, if, a, theory, s, lagrangian, or, more, precisely, the, action, is, invariant, under, a, certain, local, transformation, then, the, transformation, is, referred, to, as, a, gauge, symmetry, of, the, theory, 482, 483, gauge, symmetries, form, a, group, at, every, spacetime, point, in, the, case, of, qed, the, successive, application, of, two, different, local, symmetry, transformations, e, i, x, displaystyle, e, i, alpha, x, and, e, i, x, displaystyle, e, i, alpha, x, is, yet, another, symmetry, transformation, e, i, x, x, displaystyle, e, i, for, any, x, e, i, x, displaystyle, e, i, alpha, x, is, an, element, of, the, u, 1, group, thus, qed, is, said, to, have, u, 1, gauge, symmetry, 496, the, photon, field, a, may, be, referred, to, as, the, u, 1, gauge, boson, u, 1, is, an, abelian, group, meaning, that, the, result, is, the, same, regardless, of, the, order, in, which, its, elements, are, applied, qfts, can, also, be, built, on, non, abelian, groups, giving, rise, to, non, abelian, gauge, theories, also, known, as, yang, mills, theories, 489, quantum, chromodynamics, which, describes, the, strong, interaction, is, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, with, an, su, 3, gauge, symmetry, it, contains, three, dirac, fields, i, i, 1, 2, 3, representing, quark, fields, as, well, as, eight, vector, fields, a, a, a, 1, 8, representing, gluon, fields, which, are, the, su, 3, gauge, bosons, 547, the, qcd, lagrangian, density, is, 490, 491, where, d, is, the, gauge, covariant, derivative, where, g, is, the, coupling, constant, t, a, are, the, eight, generators, of, su, 3, in, the, fundamental, representation, 3, 3, matrices, and, f, abc, are, the, structure, constants, of, su, 3, repeated, indices, i, j, a, are, implicitly, summed, over, following, einstein, notation, this, lagrangian, is, invariant, under, the, transformation, where, u, x, is, an, element, of, su, 3, at, every, spacetime, point, x, the, preceding, discussion, of, symmetries, is, on, the, level, of, the, lagrangian, in, other, words, these, are, classical, symmetries, after, quantization, some, theories, will, no, longer, exhibit, their, classical, symmetries, a, phenomenon, called, anomaly, for, instance, in, the, path, integral, formulation, despite, the, invariance, of, the, lagrangian, density, l, displaystyle, mathcal, l, under, a, certain, local, transformation, of, the, fields, the, measure, d, textstyle, int, mathcal, d, phi, of, the, path, integral, may, change, 243, for, a, theory, describing, nature, to, be, consistent, it, must, not, contain, any, anomaly, in, its, gauge, symmetry, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particles, is, a, gauge, theory, based, on, the, group, su, 3, su, 2, u, 1, in, which, all, anomalies, exactly, cancel, 705, 707, the, theoretical, foundation, of, general, relativity, the, equivalence, principle, can, also, be, understood, as, a, form, of, gauge, symmetry, making, general, relativity, a, gauge, theory, based, on, the, lorentz, group, noether, s, theorem, states, that, every, continuous, symmetry, i, e, the, parameter, in, the, symmetry, transformation, being, continuous, rather, than, discrete, leads, to, a, corresponding, conservation, law, 17, 18, 73, for, example, the, u, 1, symmetry, of, qed, implies, charge, conservation, gauge, transformations, do, not, relate, distinct, quantum, states, rather, it, relates, two, equivalent, mathematical, descriptions, of, the, same, quantum, state, as, an, example, the, photon, field, a, being, a, four, vector, has, four, apparent, degrees, of, freedom, but, the, actual, state, of, a, photon, is, described, by, its, two, degrees, of, freedom, corresponding, to, the, polarization, the, remaining, two, degrees, of, freedom, are, said, to, be, redundant, apparently, different, ways, of, writing, a, can, be, related, to, each, other, by, a, gauge, transformation, and, in, fact, describe, the, same, state, of, the, photon, field, in, this, sense, gauge, invariance, is, not, a, real, symmetry, but, a, reflection, of, the, redundancy, of, the, chosen, mathematical, description, 168, to, account, for, the, gauge, redundancy, in, the, path, integral, formulation, one, must, perform, the, so, called, faddeev, popov, gauge, fixing, procedure, in, non, abelian, gauge, theories, such, a, procedure, introduces, new, fields, called, ghosts, particles, corresponding, to, the, ghost, fields, are, called, ghost, particles, which, cannot, be, detected, externally, 512, 515, a, more, rigorous, generalization, of, the, faddeev, popov, procedure, is, given, by, brst, quantization, 517, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, is, a, mechanism, whereby, the, symmetry, of, the, lagrangian, is, violated, by, the, system, described, by, it, 347, to, illustrate, the, mechanism, consider, a, linear, sigma, model, containing, n, real, scalar, fields, described, by, the, lagrangian, density, where, and, are, real, parameters, the, theory, admits, an, o, n, global, symmetry, the, lowest, energy, state, ground, state, or, vacuum, state, of, the, classical, theory, is, any, uniform, field, 0, satisfying, without, loss, of, generality, let, the, ground, state, be, in, the, n, th, direction, the, original, n, fields, can, be, rewritten, as, and, the, original, lagrangian, density, as, where, k, 1, n, 1, the, original, o, n, global, symmetry, is, no, longer, manifest, leaving, only, the, subgroup, o, n, 1, the, larger, symmetry, before, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, is, said, to, be, hidden, or, spontaneously, broken, 349, 350, goldstone, s, theorem, states, that, under, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, every, broken, continuous, global, symmetry, leads, to, a, massless, field, called, the, goldstone, boson, in, the, above, example, o, n, has, n, n, 1, 2, continuous, symmetries, the, dimension, of, its, lie, algebra, while, o, n, 1, has, n, 1, n, 2, 2, the, number, of, broken, symmetries, is, their, difference, n, 1, which, corresponds, to, the, n, 1, massless, fields, k, 351, on, the, other, hand, when, a, gauge, as, opposed, to, global, symmetry, is, spontaneously, broken, the, resulting, goldstone, boson, is, eaten, by, the, corresponding, gauge, boson, by, becoming, an, additional, degree, of, freedom, for, the, gauge, boson, the, goldstone, boson, equivalence, theorem, states, that, at, high, energy, the, amplitude, for, emission, or, absorption, of, a, longitudinally, polarized, massive, gauge, boson, becomes, equal, to, the, amplitude, for, emission, or, absorption, of, the, goldstone, boson, that, was, eaten, by, the, gauge, boson, 743, 744, in, the, qft, of, ferromagnetism, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, can, explain, the, alignment, of, magnetic, dipoles, at, low, temperatures, 199, in, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particles, the, w, and, z, bosons, which, would, otherwise, be, massless, as, a, result, of, gauge, symmetry, acquire, mass, through, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, of, the, higgs, boson, a, process, called, the, higgs, mechanism, 690, all, experimentally, known, symmetries, in, nature, relate, bosons, to, bosons, and, fermions, to, fermions, theorists, have, hypothesized, the, existence, of, a, type, of, symmetry, called, supersymmetry, that, relates, bosons, and, fermions, 795, 443, the, standard, model, obeys, poincar, symmetry, whose, generators, are, the, spacetime, translations, p, and, the, lorentz, transformations, j, 58, 60, in, addition, to, these, generators, supersymmetry, in, 3, 1, dimensions, includes, additional, generators, q, called, supercharges, which, themselves, transform, as, weyl, fermions, 795, 444, the, symmetry, group, generated, by, all, these, generators, is, known, as, the, super, poincar, group, in, general, there, can, be, more, than, one, set, of, supersymmetry, generators, q, i, i, 1, n, which, generate, the, corresponding, n, 1, supersymmetry, n, 2, supersymmetry, and, so, on, 795, 450, supersymmetry, can, also, be, constructed, in, other, dimensions, most, notably, in, 1, 1, dimensions, for, its, application, in, superstring, theory, the, lagrangian, of, a, supersymmetric, theory, must, be, invariant, under, the, action, of, the, super, poincar, group, 448, examples, of, such, theories, include, minimal, supersymmetric, standard, model, mssm, n, 4, supersymmetric, yang, mills, theory, 450, and, superstring, theory, in, a, supersymmetric, theory, every, fermion, has, a, bosonic, superpartner, and, vice, versa, 444, if, supersymmetry, is, promoted, to, a, local, symmetry, then, the, resultant, gauge, theory, is, an, extension, of, general, relativity, called, supergravity, supersymmetry, is, a, potential, solution, to, many, current, problems, in, physics, for, example, the, hierarchy, problem, of, the, standard, model, why, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, is, not, radiatively, corrected, under, renormalization, to, a, very, high, scale, such, as, the, grand, unified, scale, or, the, planck, scale, can, be, resolved, by, relating, the, higgs, field, and, its, super, partner, the, higgsino, radiative, corrections, due, to, higgs, boson, loops, in, feynman, diagrams, are, cancelled, by, corresponding, higgsino, loops, supersymmetry, also, offers, answers, to, the, grand, unification, of, all, gauge, coupling, constants, in, the, standard, model, as, well, as, the, nature, of, dark, matter, 796, 797, nevertheless, experiments, have, yet, to, provide, evidence, for, the, existence, of, supersymmetric, particles, if, supersymmetry, were, a, true, symmetry, of, nature, then, it, must, be, a, broken, symmetry, and, the, energy, of, symmetry, breaking, must, be, higher, than, those, achievable, by, present, day, experiments, 797, 443, the, 4, theory, qed, qcd, as, well, as, the, whole, standard, model, all, assume, a, 3, 1, dimensional, minkowski, space, 3, spatial, and, 1, time, dimensions, as, the, background, on, which, the, quantum, fields, are, defined, however, qft, a, priori, imposes, no, restriction, on, the, number, of, dimensions, nor, the, geometry, of, spacetime, in, condensed, matter, physics, qft, is, used, to, describe, 2, 1, dimensional, electron, gases, in, high, energy, physics, string, theory, is, a, type, of, 1, 1, dimensional, qft, 452, while, kaluza, klein, theory, uses, gravity, in, extra, dimensions, to, produce, gauge, theories, in, lower, dimensions, 428, 429, in, minkowski, space, the, flat, metric, is, used, to, raise, and, lower, spacetime, indices, in, the, lagrangian, e, g, where, is, the, inverse, of, satisfying, for, qfts, in, curved, spacetime, on, the, other, hand, a, general, metric, such, as, the, schwarzschild, metric, describing, a, black, hole, is, used, where, g, is, the, inverse, of, g, for, a, real, scalar, field, the, lagrangian, density, in, a, general, spacetime, background, is, where, g, det, g, and, denotes, the, covariant, derivative, the, lagrangian, of, a, qft, hence, its, calculational, results, and, physical, predictions, depends, on, the, geometry, of, the, spacetime, background, the, correlation, functions, and, physical, predictions, of, a, qft, depend, on, the, spacetime, metric, g, for, a, special, class, of, qfts, called, topological, quantum, field, theories, tqfts, all, correlation, functions, are, independent, of, continuous, changes, in, the, spacetime, metric, 36, qfts, in, curved, spacetime, generally, change, according, to, the, geometry, local, structure, of, the, spacetime, background, while, tqfts, are, invariant, under, spacetime, diffeomorphisms, but, are, sensitive, to, the, topology, global, structure, of, spacetime, this, means, that, all, calculational, results, of, tqfts, are, topological, invariants, of, the, underlying, spacetime, chern, simons, theory, is, an, example, of, tqft, and, has, been, used, to, construct, models, of, quantum, gravity, applications, of, tqft, include, the, fractional, quantum, hall, effect, and, topological, quantum, computers, 1, 5, the, world, line, trajectory, of, fractionalized, particles, known, as, anyons, can, form, a, link, configuration, in, the, spacetime, which, relates, the, braiding, statistics, of, anyons, in, physics, to, the, link, invariants, in, mathematics, topological, quantum, field, theories, tqfts, applicable, to, the, frontier, research, of, topological, quantum, matters, include, chern, simons, witten, gauge, theories, in, 2, 1, spacetime, dimensions, other, new, exotic, tqfts, in, 3, 1, spacetime, dimensions, and, beyond, using, perturbation, theory, the, total, effect, of, a, small, interaction, term, can, be, approximated, order, by, order, by, a, series, expansion, in, the, number, of, virtual, particles, participating, in, the, interaction, every, term, in, the, expansion, may, be, understood, as, one, possible, way, for, physical, particles, to, interact, with, each, other, via, virtual, particles, expressed, visually, using, a, feynman, diagram, the, electromagnetic, force, between, two, electrons, in, qed, is, represented, to, first, order, in, perturbation, theory, by, the, propagation, of, a, virtual, photon, in, a, similar, manner, the, w, and, z, bosons, carry, the, weak, interaction, while, gluons, carry, the, strong, interaction, the, interpretation, of, an, interaction, as, a, sum, of, intermediate, states, involving, the, exchange, of, various, virtual, particles, only, makes, sense, in, the, framework, of, perturbation, theory, in, contrast, non, perturbative, methods, in, qft, treat, the, interacting, lagrangian, as, a, whole, without, any, series, expansion, instead, of, particles, that, carry, interactions, these, methods, have, spawned, such, concepts, as, t, hooft, polyakov, monopole, domain, wall, flux, tube, and, instanton, examples, of, qfts, that, are, completely, solvable, non, perturbatively, include, minimal, models, of, conformal, field, theory, and, the, thirring, model, in, spite, of, its, overwhelming, success, in, particle, physics, and, condensed, matter, physics, qft, itself, lacks, a, formal, mathematical, foundation, for, example, according, to, haag, s, theorem, there, does, not, exist, a, well, defined, interaction, picture, for, qft, which, implies, that, perturbation, theory, of, qft, which, underlies, the, entire, feynman, diagram, method, is, fundamentally, ill, defined, however, perturbative, quantum, field, theory, which, only, requires, that, quantities, be, computable, as, a, formal, power, series, without, any, convergence, requirements, can, be, given, a, rigorous, mathematical, treatment, in, particular, kevin, costello, s, monograph, renormalization, and, effective, field, theory, provides, a, rigorous, formulation, of, perturbative, renormalization, that, combines, both, the, effective, field, theory, approaches, of, kadanoff, wilson, and, polchinski, together, with, the, batalin, vilkovisky, approach, to, quantizing, gauge, theories, furthermore, perturbative, path, integral, methods, typically, understood, as, formal, computational, methods, inspired, from, finite, dimensional, integration, theory, can, be, given, a, sound, mathematical, interpretation, from, their, finite, dimensional, analogues, since, the, 1950s, theoretical, physicists, and, mathematicians, have, attempted, to, organize, all, qfts, into, a, set, of, axioms, in, order, to, establish, the, existence, of, concrete, models, of, relativistic, qft, in, a, mathematically, rigorous, way, and, to, study, their, properties, this, line, of, study, is, called, constructive, quantum, field, theory, a, subfield, of, mathematical, physics, 2, which, has, led, to, such, results, as, cpt, theorem, spin, statistics, theorem, and, goldstone, s, theorem, and, also, to, mathematically, rigorous, constructions, of, many, interacting, qfts, in, two, and, three, spacetime, dimensions, e, g, two, dimensional, scalar, field, theories, with, arbitrary, polynomial, interactions, the, three, dimensional, scalar, field, theories, with, a, quartic, interaction, etc, compared, to, ordinary, qft, topological, quantum, field, theory, and, conformal, field, theory, are, better, supported, mathematically, both, can, be, classified, in, the, framework, of, representations, of, cobordisms, algebraic, quantum, field, theory, is, another, approach, to, the, axiomatization, of, qft, in, which, the, fundamental, objects, are, local, operators, and, the, algebraic, relations, between, them, axiomatic, systems, following, this, approach, include, wightman, axioms, and, haag, kastler, axioms, 2, 3, one, way, to, construct, theories, satisfying, wightman, axioms, is, to, use, osterwalder, schrader, axioms, which, give, the, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, for, a, real, time, theory, to, be, obtained, from, an, imaginary, time, theory, by, analytic, continuation, wick, rotation, 10, yang, mills, existence, and, mass, gap, one, of, the, millennium, prize, problems, concerns, the, well, defined, existence, of, yang, mills, theories, as, set, out, by, the, above, axioms, the, full, problem, statement, is, as, follows, prove, that, for, any, compact, simple, gauge, group, g, a, non, trivial, quantum, yang, mills, theory, exists, on, r, 4, displaystyle, mathbb, r, 4, and, has, a, mass, gap, 0, existence, includes, establishing, axiomatic, properties, at, least, as, strong, as, those, cited, in, streater, wightman, 1964, osterwalder, schrader, 1973, and, osterwalder, schrader, 1975
