weathering, is, the, deterioration, of, rocks, soils, and, minerals, as, well, as, wood, and, artificial, materials, through, contact, with, water, atmospheric, gases, sunlight, and, biological, organisms, it, occurs, in, situ, on, site, with, little, or, no, movement, and, so, is, distinct, from, erosion, which, involves, the, transport, of, rocks, and, minerals, by, agents, such, as, water, ice, snow, wind, waves, and, gravity, weathering, processes, are, either, physical, or, chemical, the, former, involves, the, breakdown, of, rocks, and, soils, through, such, mechanical, effects, as, heat, water, ice, and, wind, the, latter, covers, reactions, to, water, atmospheric, gases, and, biologically, produced, chemicals, with, rocks, and, soils, water, is, the, principal, agent, behind, both, kinds, though, atmospheric, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, and, the, activities, of, biological, organisms, are, also, important, biological, chemical, weathering, is, also, called, biological, weathering, the, materials, left, after, the, rock, breaks, down, combine, with, organic, material, to, create, soil, many, of, earth, s, landforms, and, landscapes, are, the, result, of, weathering, erosion, and, redeposition, weathering, is, a, crucial, part, of, the, rock, cycle, sedimentary, rock, the, product, of, weathered, rock, covers, 66, of, the, earth, s, continents, and, much, of, the, ocean, floor, physical, weathering, also, called, mechanical, weathering, or, disaggregation, is, the, class, of, processes, that, causes, the, disintegration, of, rocks, without, chemical, change, physical, weathering, involves, the, breakdown, of, rocks, into, smaller, fragments, through, processes, such, as, expansion, and, contraction, mainly, due, to, temperature, changes, two, types, of, physical, breakdown, are, freeze, thaw, weathering, and, thermal, fracturing, pressure, release, can, also, cause, weathering, without, temperature, change, it, is, usually, much, less, important, than, chemical, weathering, but, can, be, significant, in, subarctic, or, alpine, environments, furthermore, chemical, and, physical, weathering, often, go, hand, in, hand, for, example, cracks, extended, by, physical, weathering, will, increase, the, surface, area, exposed, to, chemical, action, thus, amplifying, the, rate, of, disintegration, frost, weathering, is, the, most, important, form, of, physical, weathering, next, in, importance, is, wedging, by, plant, roots, which, sometimes, enter, cracks, in, rocks, and, pry, them, apart, the, burrowing, of, worms, or, other, animals, may, also, help, disintegrate, rock, as, can, plucking, by, lichens, frost, weathering, is, the, collective, name, for, those, forms, of, physical, weathering, that, are, caused, by, the, formation, of, ice, within, rock, outcrops, it, was, long, believed, that, the, most, important, of, these, is, frost, wedging, which, results, from, the, expansion, of, pore, water, when, it, freezes, a, growing, body, of, theoretical, and, experimental, work, suggests, that, ice, segregation, whereby, supercooled, water, migrates, to, lenses, of, ice, forming, within, the, rock, is, the, more, important, mechanism, when, water, freezes, its, volume, increases, by, 9, 2, this, expansion, can, theoretically, generate, pressures, greater, than, 200, megapascals, 29, 000, psi, though, a, more, realistic, upper, limit, is, 14, megapascals, 2, 000, psi, this, is, still, much, greater, than, the, tensile, strength, of, granite, which, is, about, 4, megapascals, 580, psi, this, makes, frost, wedging, in, which, pore, water, freezes, and, its, volumetric, expansion, fractures, the, enclosing, rock, appear, to, be, a, plausible, mechanism, for, frost, weathering, ice, will, simply, expand, out, of, a, straight, open, fracture, before, it, can, generate, significant, pressure, thus, frost, wedging, can, only, take, place, in, small, tortuous, fractures, the, rock, must, also, be, almost, completely, saturated, with, water, or, the, ice, will, simply, expand, into, the, air, spaces, in, the, unsaturated, rock, without, generating, much, pressure, these, conditions, are, unusual, enough, that, frost, wedging, is, unlikely, to, be, the, dominant, process, of, frost, weathering, frost, wedging, is, most, effective, where, there, are, daily, cycles, of, melting, and, freezing, of, water, saturated, rock, so, it, is, unlikely, to, be, significant, in, the, tropics, in, polar, regions, or, in, arid, climates, ice, segregation, is, a, less, well, characterized, mechanism, of, physical, weathering, it, takes, place, because, ice, grains, always, have, a, surface, layer, often, just, a, few, molecules, thick, that, resembles, liquid, water, more, than, solid, ice, even, at, temperatures, well, below, the, freezing, point, this, premelted, liquid, layer, has, unusual, properties, including, a, strong, tendency, to, draw, in, water, by, capillary, action, from, warmer, parts, of, the, rock, this, results, in, growth, of, the, ice, grain, that, puts, considerable, pressure, on, the, surrounding, rock, up, to, ten, times, greater, than, is, likely, with, frost, wedging, this, mechanism, is, most, effective, in, rock, whose, temperature, averages, just, below, the, freezing, point, 4, to, 15, c, 25, to, 5, f, ice, segregation, results, in, growth, of, ice, needles, and, ice, lenses, within, fractures, in, the, rock, and, parallel, to, the, rock, surface, which, gradually, pry, the, rock, apart, thermal, stress, weathering, results, from, the, expansion, and, contraction, of, rock, due, to, temperature, changes, thermal, stress, weathering, is, most, effective, when, the, heated, portion, of, the, rock, is, buttressed, by, surrounding, rock, so, that, it, is, free, to, expand, in, only, one, direction, thermal, stress, weathering, comprises, two, main, types, thermal, shock, and, thermal, fatigue, thermal, shock, takes, place, when, the, stresses, are, so, great, that, the, rock, cracks, immediately, but, this, is, uncommon, more, typical, is, thermal, fatigue, in, which, the, stresses, are, not, great, enough, to, cause, immediate, rock, failure, but, repeated, cycles, of, stress, and, release, gradually, weaken, the, rock, thermal, stress, weathering, is, an, important, mechanism, in, deserts, where, there, is, a, large, diurnal, temperature, range, hot, in, the, day, and, cold, at, night, as, a, result, thermal, stress, weathering, is, sometimes, called, insolation, weathering, but, this, is, misleading, thermal, stress, weathering, can, be, caused, by, any, large, change, of, temperature, and, not, just, intense, solar, heating, it, is, likely, as, important, in, cold, climates, as, in, hot, arid, climates, wildfires, can, also, be, a, significant, cause, of, rapid, thermal, stress, weathering, the, importance, of, thermal, stress, weathering, has, long, been, discounted, by, geologists, based, on, experiments, in, the, early, 20th, century, that, seemed, to, show, that, its, effects, were, unimportant, these, experiments, have, since, been, criticized, as, unrealistic, since, the, rock, samples, were, small, were, polished, which, reduces, nucleation, of, fractures, and, were, not, buttressed, these, small, samples, were, thus, able, to, expand, freely, in, all, directions, when, heated, in, experimental, ovens, which, failed, to, produce, the, kinds, of, stress, likely, in, natural, settings, the, experiments, were, also, more, sensitive, to, thermal, shock, than, thermal, fatigue, but, thermal, fatigue, is, likely, the, more, important, mechanism, in, nature, geomorphologists, have, begun, to, reemphasize, the, importance, of, thermal, stress, weathering, particularly, in, cold, climates, pressure, release, or, unloading, is, a, form, of, physical, weathering, seen, when, deeply, buried, rock, is, exhumed, intrusive, igneous, rocks, such, as, granite, are, formed, deep, beneath, the, earth, s, surface, they, are, under, tremendous, pressure, because, of, the, overlying, rock, material, when, erosion, removes, the, overlying, rock, material, these, intrusive, rocks, are, exposed, and, the, pressure, on, them, is, released, the, outer, parts, of, the, rocks, then, tend, to, expand, the, expansion, sets, up, stresses, which, cause, fractures, parallel, to, the, rock, surface, to, form, over, time, sheets, of, rock, break, away, from, the, exposed, rocks, along, the, fractures, a, process, known, as, exfoliation, exfoliation, due, to, pressure, release, is, also, known, as, sheeting, as, with, thermal, weathering, pressure, release, is, most, effective, in, buttressed, rock, here, the, differential, stress, directed, toward, the, unbuttressed, surface, can, be, as, high, as, 35, megapascals, 5, 100, psi, easily, enough, to, shatter, rock, this, mechanism, is, also, responsible, for, spalling, in, mines, and, quarries, and, for, the, formation, of, joints, in, rock, outcrops, retreat, of, an, overlying, glacier, can, also, lead, to, exfoliation, due, to, pressure, release, this, can, be, enhanced, by, other, physical, wearing, mechanisms, salt, crystallization, also, known, as, salt, weathering, salt, wedging, or, haloclasty, causes, disintegration, of, rocks, when, saline, solutions, seep, into, cracks, and, joints, in, the, rocks, and, evaporate, leaving, salt, crystals, behind, as, with, ice, segregation, the, surfaces, of, the, salt, grains, draw, in, additional, dissolved, salts, through, capillary, action, causing, the, growth, of, salt, lenses, that, exert, high, pressure, on, the, surrounding, rock, sodium, and, magnesium, salts, are, the, most, effective, at, producing, salt, weathering, salt, weathering, can, also, take, place, when, pyrite, in, sedimentary, rock, is, chemically, weathered, to, iron, ii, sulfate, and, gypsum, which, then, crystallize, as, salt, lenses, salt, crystallization, can, take, place, wherever, salts, are, concentrated, by, evaporation, it, is, thus, most, common, in, arid, climates, where, strong, heating, causes, strong, evaporation, and, along, coasts, salt, weathering, is, likely, important, in, the, formation, of, tafoni, a, class, of, cavernous, rock, weathering, structures, living, organisms, may, contribute, to, mechanical, weathering, as, well, as, chemical, weathering, see, biological, weathering, below, lichens, and, mosses, grow, on, essentially, bare, rock, surfaces, and, create, a, more, humid, chemical, microenvironment, the, attachment, of, these, organisms, to, the, rock, surface, enhances, physical, as, well, as, chemical, breakdown, of, the, surface, microlayer, of, the, rock, lichens, have, been, observed, to, pry, mineral, grains, loose, from, bare, shale, with, their, hyphae, rootlike, attachment, structures, a, process, described, as, plucking, and, to, pull, the, fragments, into, their, body, where, the, fragments, then, undergo, a, process, of, chemical, weathering, not, unlike, digestion, on, a, larger, scale, seedlings, sprouting, in, a, crevice, and, plant, roots, exert, physical, pressure, as, well, as, providing, a, pathway, for, water, and, chemical, infiltration, most, rock, forms, at, elevated, temperature, and, pressure, and, the, minerals, making, up, the, rock, are, often, chemically, unstable, in, the, relatively, cool, wet, and, oxidizing, conditions, typical, of, the, earth, s, surface, chemical, weathering, takes, place, when, water, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, other, chemical, substances, react, with, rock, to, change, its, composition, these, reactions, convert, some, of, the, original, primary, minerals, in, the, rock, to, secondary, minerals, remove, other, substances, as, solutes, and, leave, the, most, stable, minerals, as, a, chemically, unchanged, resistate, in, effect, chemical, weathering, changes, the, original, set, of, minerals, in, the, rock, into, a, new, set, of, minerals, that, is, in, closer, equilibrium, with, surface, conditions, true, equilibrium, is, rarely, reached, because, weathering, is, a, slow, process, and, leaching, carries, away, solutes, produced, by, weathering, reactions, before, they, can, accumulate, to, equilibrium, levels, this, is, particularly, true, in, tropical, environments, water, is, the, principal, agent, of, chemical, weathering, converting, many, primary, minerals, to, clay, minerals, or, hydrated, oxides, via, reactions, collectively, described, as, hydrolysis, oxygen, is, also, important, acting, to, oxidize, many, minerals, as, is, carbon, dioxide, whose, weathering, reactions, are, described, as, carbonation, the, process, of, mountain, block, uplift, is, important, in, exposing, new, rock, strata, to, the, atmosphere, and, moisture, enabling, important, chemical, weathering, to, occur, significant, release, occurs, of, ca, 2, and, other, ions, into, surface, waters, dissolution, also, called, simple, solution, or, congruent, dissolution, is, the, process, in, which, a, mineral, dissolves, completely, without, producing, any, new, solid, substance, rainwater, easily, dissolves, soluble, minerals, such, as, halite, or, gypsum, but, can, also, dissolve, highly, resistant, minerals, such, as, quartz, given, sufficient, time, water, breaks, the, bonds, between, atoms, in, the, crystal, the, overall, reaction, for, dissolution, of, quartz, is, the, dissolved, quartz, takes, the, form, of, silicic, acid, a, particularly, important, form, of, dissolution, is, carbonate, dissolution, in, which, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, enhances, solution, weathering, carbonate, dissolution, affects, rocks, containing, calcium, carbonate, such, as, limestone, and, chalk, it, takes, place, when, rainwater, combines, with, carbon, dioxide, to, form, carbonic, acid, a, weak, acid, which, dissolves, calcium, carbonate, limestone, and, forms, soluble, calcium, bicarbonate, despite, a, slower, reaction, kinetics, this, process, is, thermodynamically, favored, at, low, temperature, because, colder, water, holds, more, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, gas, due, to, the, retrograde, solubility, of, gases, carbonate, dissolution, is, therefore, an, important, feature, of, glacial, weathering, carbonate, dissolution, involves, the, following, steps, carbonate, dissolution, on, the, surface, of, well, jointed, limestone, produces, a, dissected, limestone, pavement, this, process, is, most, effective, along, the, joints, widening, and, deepening, them, in, unpolluted, environments, the, ph, of, rainwater, due, to, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, is, around, 5, 6, acid, rain, occurs, when, gases, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxides, are, present, in, the, atmosphere, these, oxides, react, in, the, rain, water, to, produce, stronger, acids, and, can, lower, the, ph, to, 4, 5, or, even, 3, 0, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, comes, from, volcanic, eruptions, or, from, fossil, fuels, and, can, become, sulfuric, acid, within, rainwater, which, can, cause, solution, weathering, to, the, rocks, on, which, it, falls, hydrolysis, also, called, incongruent, dissolution, is, a, form, of, chemical, weathering, in, which, only, part, of, a, mineral, is, taken, into, solution, the, rest, of, the, mineral, is, transformed, into, a, new, solid, material, such, as, a, clay, mineral, for, example, forsterite, magnesium, olivine, is, hydrolyzed, into, solid, brucite, and, dissolved, silicic, acid, most, hydrolysis, during, weathering, of, minerals, is, acid, hydrolysis, in, which, protons, hydrogen, ions, which, are, present, in, acidic, water, attack, chemical, bonds, in, mineral, crystals, the, bonds, between, different, cations, and, oxygen, ions, in, minerals, differ, in, strength, and, the, weakest, will, be, attacked, first, the, result, is, that, minerals, in, igneous, rock, weather, in, roughly, the, same, order, in, which, they, were, originally, formed, bowen, s, reaction, series, relative, bond, strength, is, shown, in, the, following, table, this, table, is, only, a, rough, guide, to, order, of, weathering, some, minerals, such, as, illite, are, unusually, stable, while, silica, is, unusually, unstable, given, the, strength, of, the, silicon, oxygen, bond, carbon, dioxide, that, dissolves, in, water, to, form, carbonic, acid, is, the, most, important, source, of, protons, but, organic, acids, are, also, important, natural, sources, of, acidity, acid, hydrolysis, from, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, is, sometimes, described, as, carbonation, and, can, result, in, weathering, of, the, primary, minerals, to, secondary, carbonate, minerals, for, example, weathering, of, forsterite, can, produce, magnesite, instead, of, brucite, via, the, reaction, carbonic, acid, is, consumed, by, silicate, weathering, resulting, in, more, alkaline, solutions, because, of, the, bicarbonate, this, is, an, important, reaction, in, controlling, the, amount, of, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, and, can, affect, climate, aluminosilicates, containing, highly, soluble, cations, such, as, sodium, or, potassium, ions, will, release, the, cations, as, dissolved, bicarbonates, during, acid, hydrolysis, within, the, weathering, environment, chemical, oxidation, of, a, variety, of, metals, occurs, the, most, commonly, observed, is, the, oxidation, of, fe, 2, iron, by, oxygen, and, water, to, form, fe, 3, oxides, and, hydroxides, such, as, goethite, limonite, and, hematite, this, gives, the, affected, rocks, a, reddish, brown, coloration, on, the, surface, which, crumbles, easily, and, weakens, the, rock, many, other, metallic, ores, and, minerals, oxidize, and, hydrate, to, produce, colored, deposits, as, does, sulfur, during, the, weathering, of, sulfide, minerals, such, as, chalcopyrites, or, cufes, 2, oxidizing, to, copper, hydroxide, and, iron, oxides, mineral, hydration, is, a, form, of, chemical, weathering, that, involves, the, rigid, attachment, of, water, molecules, or, h, and, oh, ions, to, the, atoms, and, molecules, of, a, mineral, no, significant, dissolution, takes, place, for, example, iron, oxides, are, converted, to, iron, hydroxides, and, the, hydration, of, anhydrite, forms, gypsum, bulk, hydration, of, minerals, is, secondary, in, importance, to, dissolution, hydrolysis, and, oxidation, but, hydration, of, the, crystal, surface, is, the, crucial, first, step, in, hydrolysis, a, fresh, surface, of, a, mineral, crystal, exposes, ions, whose, electrical, charge, attracts, water, molecules, some, of, these, molecules, break, into, h, that, bonds, to, exposed, anions, usually, oxygen, and, oh, that, bonds, to, exposed, cations, this, further, disrupts, the, surface, making, it, susceptible, to, various, hydrolysis, reactions, additional, protons, replace, cations, exposed, on, the, surface, freeing, the, cations, as, solutes, as, cations, are, removed, silicon, oxygen, and, silicon, aluminium, bonds, become, more, susceptible, to, hydrolysis, freeing, silicic, acid, and, aluminium, hydroxides, to, be, leached, away, or, to, form, clay, minerals, laboratory, experiments, show, that, weathering, of, feldspar, crystals, begins, at, dislocations, or, other, defects, on, the, surface, of, the, crystal, and, that, the, weathering, layer, is, only, a, few, atoms, thick, diffusion, within, the, mineral, grain, does, not, appear, to, be, significant, mineral, weathering, can, also, be, initiated, or, accelerated, by, soil, microorganisms, soil, organisms, make, up, about, 10, mg, cm, 3, of, typical, soils, and, laboratory, experiments, have, demonstrated, that, albite, and, muscovite, weather, twice, as, fast, in, live, versus, sterile, soil, lichens, on, rocks, are, among, the, most, effective, biological, agents, of, chemical, weathering, for, example, an, experimental, study, on, hornblende, granite, in, new, jersey, us, demonstrated, a, 3x, 4x, increase, in, weathering, rate, under, lichen, covered, surfaces, compared, to, recently, exposed, bare, rock, surfaces, the, most, common, forms, of, biological, weathering, result, from, the, release, of, chelating, compounds, such, as, certain, organic, acids, and, siderophores, and, of, carbon, dioxide, and, organic, acids, by, plants, roots, can, build, up, the, carbon, dioxide, level, to, 30, of, all, soil, gases, aided, by, adsorption, of, co, 2, on, clay, minerals, and, the, very, slow, diffusion, rate, of, co, 2, out, of, the, soil, the, co, 2, and, organic, acids, help, break, down, aluminium, and, iron, containing, compounds, in, the, soils, beneath, them, roots, have, a, negative, electrical, charge, balanced, by, protons, in, the, soil, next, to, the, roots, and, these, can, be, exchanged, for, essential, nutrient, cations, such, as, potassium, decaying, remains, of, dead, plants, in, soil, may, form, organic, acids, which, when, dissolved, in, water, cause, chemical, weathering, chelating, compounds, mostly, low, molecular, weight, organic, acids, are, capable, of, removing, metal, ions, from, bare, rock, surfaces, with, aluminium, and, silicon, being, particularly, susceptible, the, ability, to, break, down, bare, rock, allows, lichens, to, be, among, the, first, colonizers, of, dry, land, the, accumulation, of, chelating, compounds, can, easily, affect, surrounding, rocks, and, soils, and, may, lead, to, podsolisation, of, soils, the, symbiotic, mycorrhizal, fungi, associated, with, tree, root, systems, can, release, inorganic, nutrients, from, minerals, such, as, apatite, or, biotite, and, transfer, these, nutrients, to, the, trees, thus, contributing, to, tree, nutrition, it, was, also, recently, evidenced, that, bacterial, communities, can, impact, mineral, stability, leading, to, the, release, of, inorganic, nutrients, a, large, range, of, bacterial, strains, or, communities, from, diverse, genera, have, been, reported, to, be, able, to, colonize, mineral, surfaces, or, to, weather, minerals, and, for, some, of, them, a, plant, growth, promoting, effect, has, been, demonstrated, the, demonstrated, or, hypothesised, mechanisms, used, by, bacteria, to, weather, minerals, include, several, oxidoreduction, and, dissolution, reactions, as, well, as, the, production, of, weathering, agents, such, as, protons, organic, acids, and, chelating, molecules, weathering, of, basaltic, oceanic, crust, differs, in, important, respects, from, weathering, in, the, atmosphere, weathering, is, relatively, slow, with, basalt, becoming, less, dense, at, a, rate, of, about, 15, per, 100, million, years, the, basalt, becomes, hydrated, and, is, enriched, in, total, and, ferric, iron, magnesium, and, sodium, at, the, expense, of, silica, titanium, aluminum, ferrous, iron, and, calcium, buildings, made, of, any, stone, brick, or, concrete, are, susceptible, to, the, same, weathering, agents, as, any, exposed, rock, surface, also, statues, monuments, and, ornamental, stonework, can, be, badly, damaged, by, natural, weathering, processes, this, is, accelerated, in, areas, severely, affected, by, acid, rain, accelerated, building, weathering, may, be, a, threat, to, the, environment, and, occupant, safety, design, strategies, can, moderate, the, impact, of, environmental, effects, such, as, using, of, pressure, moderated, rain, screening, ensuring, that, the, hvac, system, is, able, to, effectively, control, humidity, accumulation, and, selecting, concrete, mixes, with, reduced, water, content, to, minimize, the, impact, of, freeze, thaw, cycles, granitic, rock, which, is, the, most, abundant, crystalline, rock, exposed, at, the, earth, s, surface, begins, weathering, with, destruction, of, hornblende, biotite, then, weathers, to, vermiculite, and, finally, oligoclase, and, microcline, are, destroyed, all, are, converted, into, a, mixture, of, clay, minerals, and, iron, oxides, the, resulting, soil, is, depleted, in, calcium, sodium, and, ferrous, iron, compared, with, the, bedrock, and, magnesium, is, reduced, by, 40, and, silicon, by, 15, at, the, same, time, the, soil, is, enriched, in, aluminium, and, potassium, by, at, least, 50, by, titanium, whose, abundance, triples, and, by, ferric, iron, whose, abundance, increases, by, an, order, of, magnitude, compared, with, the, bedrock, basaltic, rock, is, more, easily, weathered, than, granitic, rock, due, to, its, formation, at, higher, temperatures, and, drier, conditions, the, fine, grain, size, and, presence, of, volcanic, glass, also, hasten, weathering, in, tropical, settings, it, rapidly, weathers, to, clay, minerals, aluminium, hydroxides, and, titanium, enriched, iron, oxides, because, most, basalt, is, relatively, poor, in, potassium, the, basalt, weathers, directly, to, potassium, poor, montmorillonite, then, to, kaolinite, where, leaching, is, continuous, and, intense, as, in, rain, forests, the, final, weathering, product, is, bauxite, the, principal, ore, of, aluminium, where, rainfall, is, intense, but, seasonal, as, in, monsoon, climates, the, final, weathering, product, is, iron, and, titanium, rich, laterite, conversion, of, kaolinite, to, bauxite, occurs, only, with, intense, leaching, as, ordinary, river, water, is, in, equilibrium, with, kaolinite, soil, formation, requires, between, 100, and, 1, 000, years, a, very, brief, interval, in, geologic, time, as, a, result, some, formations, show, numerous, paleosol, fossil, soil, beds, for, example, the, willwood, formation, of, wyoming, contains, over, 1, 000, paleosol, layers, in, a, 770, meters, 2, 530, ft, section, representing, 3, 5, million, years, of, geologic, time, paleosols, have, been, identified, in, formations, as, old, as, archean, over, 2, 5, billion, years, in, age, they, are, difficult, to, recognize, in, the, geologic, record, indications, that, a, sedimentary, bed, is, a, paleosol, include, a, gradational, lower, boundary, and, sharp, upper, boundary, the, presence, of, much, clay, poor, sorting, with, few, sedimentary, structures, rip, up, clasts, in, overlying, beds, and, desiccation, cracks, containing, material, from, higher, beds, the, degree, of, weathering, of, a, soil, can, be, expressed, as, the, chemical, index, of, alteration, defined, as, 100, al, 2, o, 3, al, 2, o, 3, cao, na, 2, o, k, 2, o, this, varies, from, 47, for, unweathered, upper, crust, rock, to, 100, for, fully, weathered, material, wood, can, be, physically, and, chemically, weathered, by, hydrolysis, and, other, processes, relevant, to, minerals, and, is, highly, susceptible, to, ultraviolet, radiation, from, sunlight, this, induces, photochemical, reactions, that, degrade, its, surface, these, also, significantly, weather, paint, and, plastics
