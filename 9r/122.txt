vega, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, northern, constellation, of, lyra, it, has, the, bayer, designation, lyrae, which, is, latinised, to, alpha, lyrae, and, abbreviated, alpha, lyr, or, lyr, this, star, is, relatively, close, at, only, 25, light, years, 7, 7, parsecs, from, the, sun, and, one, of, the, most, luminous, stars, in, the, sun, s, neighborhood, it, is, the, fifth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, after, arcturus, vega, has, been, extensively, studied, by, astronomers, leading, it, to, be, termed, arguably, the, next, most, important, star, in, the, sky, after, the, sun, vega, was, the, northern, pole, star, around, 12, 000, bce, and, will, be, so, again, around, the, year, 13, 727, when, its, declination, will, be, 86, 14, vega, was, the, first, star, other, than, the, sun, to, have, its, image, and, spectrum, photographed, it, was, one, of, the, first, stars, whose, distance, was, estimated, through, parallax, measurements, vega, has, functioned, as, the, baseline, for, calibrating, the, photometric, brightness, scale, and, was, one, of, the, stars, used, to, define, the, zero, point, for, the, ubv, photometric, system, vega, is, only, about, a, tenth, of, the, age, of, the, sun, but, since, it, is, 2, 1, times, as, massive, its, expected, lifetime, is, also, one, tenth, of, that, of, the, sun, both, stars, are, at, present, approaching, the, midpoint, of, their, main, sequence, lifetimes, compared, with, the, sun, vega, has, a, lower, abundance, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, vega, is, also, a, variable, star, that, is, a, star, whose, brightness, fluctuates, it, is, rotating, rapidly, with, a, speed, of, 236, km, s, at, the, equator, this, causes, the, equator, to, bulge, outward, due, to, centrifugal, effects, and, as, a, result, there, is, a, variation, of, temperature, across, the, star, s, photosphere, that, reaches, a, maximum, at, the, poles, from, earth, vega, is, observed, from, the, direction, of, one, of, these, poles, based, on, observations, of, more, infrared, radiation, than, expected, vega, appears, to, have, a, circumstellar, disk, of, dust, this, dust, is, likely, to, be, the, result, of, collisions, between, objects, in, an, orbiting, debris, disk, which, is, analogous, to, the, kuiper, belt, in, the, solar, system, stars, that, display, an, infrared, excess, due, to, dust, emission, are, termed, vega, like, stars, in, 2021, a, candidate, ultra, hot, neptune, on, a, 2, 43, day, orbit, around, vega, was, discovered, with, the, radial, velocity, method, additionally, another, possible, saturn, mass, signal, with, a, period, of, about, 200, days, lyrae, latinised, to, alpha, lyrae, is, the, star, s, bayer, designation, the, traditional, name, vega, earlier, wega, comes, from, a, loose, transliteration, of, the, arabic, word, w, qi, arabic, meaning, falling, or, landing, via, the, phrase, an, nasr, al, w, qi, arabic, the, falling, eagle, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, vega, for, this, star, it, is, now, so, entered, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, vega, can, often, be, seen, near, the, zenith, in, the, mid, northern, latitudes, during, the, evening, in, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, from, mid, southern, latitudes, it, can, be, seen, low, above, the, northern, horizon, during, the, southern, hemisphere, winter, with, a, declination, of, 38, 78, vega, can, only, be, viewed, at, latitudes, north, of, 51, s, therefore, it, does, not, rise, at, all, anywhere, in, antarctica, or, in, the, southernmost, part, of, south, america, including, punta, arenas, chile, 53, s, at, latitudes, to, the, north, of, 51, n, vega, remains, continuously, above, the, horizon, as, a, circumpolar, star, around, july, 1, vega, reaches, midnight, culmination, when, it, crosses, the, meridian, at, that, time, complementarily, vega, swoops, down, and, kisses, the, horizon, at, true, north, at, midnight, on, dec, 31, jan, 1, as, seen, from, 51, n, each, night, the, positions, of, the, stars, appear, to, change, as, the, earth, rotates, however, when, a, star, is, located, along, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, it, will, remain, in, the, same, position, and, thus, is, called, a, pole, star, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, gradually, changes, over, time, in, a, process, known, as, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, a, complete, precession, cycle, requires, 25, 770, years, during, which, time, the, pole, of, the, earth, s, rotation, follows, a, circular, path, across, the, celestial, sphere, that, passes, near, several, prominent, stars, at, present, the, pole, star, is, polaris, but, around, 12, 000, bce, the, pole, was, pointed, only, five, degrees, away, from, vega, through, precession, the, pole, will, again, pass, near, vega, around, 14, 000, ce, vega, is, the, brightest, of, the, successive, northern, pole, stars, in, 210, 000, years, vega, will, become, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, will, peak, in, brightness, in, 290, 000, years, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 81, this, star, lies, at, a, vertex, of, a, widely, spaced, asterism, called, the, summer, triangle, which, consists, of, vega, plus, the, two, first, magnitude, stars, altair, in, aquila, and, deneb, in, cygnus, this, formation, is, the, approximate, shape, of, a, right, triangle, with, vega, located, at, its, right, angle, the, summer, triangle, is, recognizable, in, the, northern, skies, for, there, are, few, other, bright, stars, in, its, vicinity, astrophotography, the, photography, of, celestial, objects, began, in, 1840, when, john, william, draper, took, an, image, of, the, moon, using, the, daguerreotype, process, on, 17, july, 1850, vega, became, the, first, star, other, than, the, sun, to, be, photographed, when, it, was, imaged, by, william, bond, and, john, adams, whipple, at, the, harvard, college, observatory, also, with, a, daguerreotype, in, august, 1872, henry, draper, took, a, photograph, of, vega, s, spectrum, the, first, photograph, of, a, star, s, spectrum, showing, absorption, lines, similar, lines, had, already, been, identified, in, the, spectrum, of, the, sun, in, 1879, william, huggins, used, photographs, of, the, spectra, of, vega, and, similar, stars, to, identify, a, set, of, twelve, very, strong, lines, that, were, common, to, this, stellar, category, these, were, later, identified, as, lines, from, the, hydrogen, balmer, series, since, 1943, the, spectrum, of, this, star, has, served, as, one, of, the, stable, anchor, points, by, which, other, stars, are, classified, the, distance, to, vega, can, be, determined, by, measuring, its, parallax, shift, against, the, background, stars, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, giuseppe, calandrelli, noted, stellar, parallax, in, 1805, 6, and, came, up, with, a, 4, second, value, for, the, star, which, was, a, gross, overestimate, the, first, person, to, publish, a, star, s, parallax, was, friedrich, g, w, von, struve, when, he, announced, a, value, of, 0, 125, arcsecond, 0, 125, for, vega, friedrich, bessel, was, skeptical, about, struve, s, data, and, when, bessel, published, a, parallax, of, 0, 314, for, the, star, system, 61, cygni, struve, revised, his, value, for, vega, s, parallax, to, nearly, double, the, original, estimate, this, change, cast, further, doubt, on, struve, s, data, thus, most, astronomers, at, the, time, including, struve, credited, bessel, with, the, first, published, parallax, result, however, struve, s, initial, result, was, actually, close, to, the, currently, accepted, value, of, 0, 129, as, determined, by, the, hipparcos, astrometry, satellite, the, brightness, of, a, star, as, seen, from, earth, is, measured, with, a, standardized, logarithmic, scale, this, apparent, magnitude, is, a, numerical, value, that, decreases, in, value, with, increasing, brightness, of, the, star, the, faintest, stars, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, are, sixth, magnitude, while, the, brightest, in, the, night, sky, sirius, is, of, magnitude, 1, 46, to, standardize, the, magnitude, scale, astronomers, chose, vega, and, several, similar, stars, and, averaged, their, brightness, to, represent, magnitude, zero, at, all, wavelengths, thus, for, many, years, vega, was, used, as, a, baseline, for, the, calibration, of, absolute, photometric, brightness, scales, however, this, is, no, longer, the, case, as, the, apparent, magnitude, zero, point, is, now, commonly, defined, in, terms, of, a, particular, numerically, specified, flux, this, approach, is, more, convenient, for, astronomers, since, vega, is, not, always, available, for, calibration, and, varies, in, brightness, the, ubv, photometric, system, measures, the, magnitude, of, stars, through, ultraviolet, blue, and, yellow, filters, producing, u, b, and, v, values, respectively, vega, is, one, of, six, a0v, stars, that, were, used, to, set, the, initial, mean, values, for, this, photometric, system, when, it, was, introduced, in, the, 1950s, the, mean, magnitudes, for, these, six, stars, were, defined, as, u, b, b, v, 0, in, effect, the, magnitude, scale, has, been, calibrated, so, that, the, magnitude, of, these, stars, is, the, same, in, the, yellow, blue, and, ultraviolet, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, thus, vega, has, a, relatively, flat, electromagnetic, spectrum, in, the, visual, region, wavelength, range, 350, 850, nanometers, most, of, which, can, be, seen, with, the, human, eye, so, the, flux, densities, are, roughly, equal, 2, 000, 4, 000, jy, however, the, flux, density, of, vega, drops, rapidly, in, the, infrared, and, is, near, 100, jy, at, 5, micrometers, photometric, measurements, of, vega, during, the, 1930s, appeared, to, show, that, the, star, had, a, low, magnitude, variability, on, the, order, of, 0, 03, magnitude, around, 2, 8, luminosity, this, range, of, variability, was, near, the, limits, of, observational, capability, for, that, time, and, so, the, subject, of, vega, s, variability, has, been, controversial, the, magnitude, of, vega, was, measured, again, in, 1981, at, the, david, dunlap, observatory, and, showed, some, slight, variability, thus, it, was, suggested, that, vega, showed, occasional, low, amplitude, pulsations, associated, with, a, delta, scuti, variable, this, is, a, category, of, stars, that, oscillate, in, a, coherent, manner, resulting, in, periodic, pulsations, in, the, star, s, luminosity, although, vega, fits, the, physical, profile, for, this, type, of, variable, other, observers, have, found, no, such, variation, thus, the, variability, was, thought, to, possibly, be, the, result, of, systematic, errors, in, measurement, however, a, 2007, article, surveyed, these, and, other, results, and, concluded, that, a, conservative, analysis, of, the, foregoing, results, suggests, that, vega, is, quite, likely, variable, in, the, 1, 2, range, with, possible, occasional, excursions, to, as, much, as, 4, from, the, mean, also, a, 2011, article, affirms, that, the, long, term, year, to, year, variability, of, vega, was, confirmed, vega, became, the, first, solitary, main, sequence, star, beyond, the, sun, known, to, be, an, x, ray, emitter, when, in, 1979, it, was, observed, from, an, imaging, x, ray, telescope, launched, on, an, aerobee, 350, from, the, white, sands, missile, range, in, 1983, vega, became, the, first, star, found, to, have, a, disk, of, dust, the, infrared, astronomical, satellite, iras, discovered, an, excess, of, infrared, radiation, coming, from, the, star, and, this, was, attributed, to, energy, emitted, by, the, orbiting, dust, as, it, was, heated, by, the, star, vega, s, spectral, class, is, a0v, making, it, a, blue, tinged, white, main, sequence, star, that, is, fusing, hydrogen, to, helium, in, its, core, since, more, massive, stars, use, their, fusion, fuel, more, quickly, than, smaller, ones, vega, s, main, sequence, lifetime, is, roughly, one, billion, years, a, tenth, of, the, sun, s, the, current, age, of, this, star, is, about, 455, million, years, or, up, to, about, half, its, expected, total, main, sequence, lifespan, after, leaving, the, main, sequence, vega, will, become, a, class, m, red, giant, and, shed, much, of, its, mass, finally, becoming, a, white, dwarf, at, present, vega, has, more, than, twice, the, mass, of, the, sun, and, its, bolometric, luminosity, is, about, 40, times, the, sun, s, because, it, is, rotating, rapidly, approximately, once, every, 16, 5, hours, and, seen, nearly, pole, on, its, apparent, luminosity, calculated, assuming, it, was, the, same, brightness, all, over, is, about, 57, times, the, sun, s, if, vega, is, variable, then, it, may, be, a, delta, scuti, type, with, a, period, of, about, 0, 107, day, most, of, the, energy, produced, at, vega, s, core, is, generated, by, the, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, cycle, cno, cycle, a, nuclear, fusion, process, that, combines, protons, to, form, helium, nuclei, through, intermediary, nuclei, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, this, process, becomes, dominant, at, a, temperature, of, about, 17, million, k, which, is, slightly, higher, than, the, core, temperature, of, the, sun, but, is, less, efficient, than, the, sun, s, proton, proton, chain, fusion, reaction, the, cno, cycle, is, highly, temperature, sensitive, which, results, in, a, convection, zone, about, the, core, that, evenly, distributes, the, ash, from, the, fusion, reaction, within, the, core, region, the, overlying, atmosphere, is, in, radiative, equilibrium, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, sun, which, has, a, radiation, zone, centered, on, the, core, with, an, overlying, convection, zone, the, energy, flux, from, vega, has, been, precisely, measured, against, standard, light, sources, at, 5, 480, the, flux, density, is, 3, 650, jy, with, an, error, margin, of, 2, the, visual, spectrum, of, vega, is, dominated, by, absorption, lines, of, hydrogen, specifically, by, the, hydrogen, balmer, series, with, the, electron, at, the, n, 2, principal, quantum, number, the, lines, of, other, elements, are, relatively, weak, with, the, strongest, being, ionized, magnesium, iron, and, chromium, the, x, ray, emission, from, vega, is, very, low, demonstrating, that, the, corona, for, this, star, must, be, very, weak, or, non, existent, however, as, the, pole, of, vega, is, facing, earth, and, a, polar, coronal, hole, may, be, present, confirmation, of, a, corona, as, the, likely, source, of, the, x, rays, detected, from, vega, or, the, region, very, close, to, vega, may, be, difficult, as, most, of, any, coronal, x, rays, would, not, be, emitted, along, the, line, of, sight, using, spectropolarimetry, a, magnetic, field, has, been, detected, on, the, surface, of, vega, by, a, team, of, astronomers, at, the, observatoire, du, pic, du, midi, this, is, the, first, such, detection, of, a, magnetic, field, on, a, spectral, class, a, star, that, is, not, an, ap, chemically, peculiar, star, the, average, line, of, sight, component, of, this, field, has, a, strength, of, 0, 6, 0, 3, gauss, g, this, is, comparable, to, the, mean, magnetic, field, on, the, sun, magnetic, fields, of, roughly, 30, g, have, been, reported, for, vega, compared, to, about, 1, g, for, the, sun, in, 2015, bright, starspots, were, detected, on, the, star, s, surface, the, first, such, detection, for, a, normal, a, type, star, and, these, features, show, evidence, of, rotational, modulation, with, a, period, of, 0, 68, day, vega, has, a, rotation, period, of, 16, 3, hours, much, faster, than, the, sun, s, rotational, period, but, similar, to, and, slightly, slower, than, those, of, jupiter, and, saturn, because, of, that, vega, is, significantly, oblate, like, those, two, planets, when, the, radius, of, vega, was, measured, to, high, accuracy, with, an, interferometer, it, resulted, in, an, unexpectedly, large, estimated, value, of, 2, 73, 0, 01, times, the, radius, of, the, sun, this, is, 60, larger, than, the, radius, of, the, star, sirius, while, stellar, models, indicated, it, should, only, be, about, 12, larger, however, this, discrepancy, can, be, explained, if, vega, is, a, rapidly, rotating, star, that, is, being, viewed, from, the, direction, of, its, pole, of, rotation, observations, by, the, chara, array, in, 2005, 06, confirmed, this, deduction, the, pole, of, vega, its, axis, of, rotation, is, inclined, no, more, than, five, degrees, from, the, line, of, sight, to, the, earth, at, the, high, end, of, estimates, for, the, rotation, velocity, for, vega, is, 236, 2, 3, 7, km, s, along, the, equator, much, higher, than, the, observed, i, e, projected, rotational, velocity, because, vega, is, seen, almost, pole, on, this, is, 88, of, the, speed, that, would, cause, the, star, to, start, breaking, up, from, centrifugal, effects, this, rapid, rotation, of, vega, produces, a, pronounced, equatorial, bulge, so, the, radius, of, the, equator, is, 19, larger, than, the, polar, radius, compared, to, just, under, 11, for, saturn, the, most, oblate, of, the, solar, system, s, planets, the, estimated, polar, radius, of, this, star, is, 2, 362, 0, 012, solar, radii, while, the, equatorial, radius, is, 2, 818, 0, 013, solar, radii, from, the, earth, this, bulge, is, being, viewed, from, the, direction, of, its, pole, producing, the, overly, large, radius, estimate, the, local, surface, gravity, at, the, poles, is, greater, than, at, the, equator, which, produces, a, variation, in, effective, temperature, over, the, star, the, polar, temperature, is, near, 10, 000, k, while, the, equatorial, temperature, is, about, 8, 152, k, this, large, temperature, difference, between, the, poles, and, the, equator, produces, a, strong, gravity, darkening, effect, as, viewed, from, the, poles, this, results, in, a, darker, lower, intensity, limb, than, would, normally, be, expected, for, a, spherically, symmetric, star, the, temperature, gradient, may, also, mean, that, vega, has, a, convection, zone, around, the, equator, while, the, remainder, of, the, atmosphere, is, likely, to, be, in, almost, pure, radiative, equilibrium, by, the, von, zeipel, theorem, the, local, luminosity, is, higher, at, the, poles, as, a, result, if, vega, were, viewed, along, the, plane, of, its, equator, instead, of, almost, pole, on, then, its, overall, brightness, would, be, lower, as, vega, had, long, been, used, as, a, standard, star, for, calibrating, telescopes, the, discovery, that, it, is, rapidly, rotating, may, challenge, some, of, the, underlying, assumptions, that, were, based, on, it, being, spherically, symmetric, with, the, viewing, angle, and, rotation, rate, of, vega, now, better, known, this, will, allow, improved, instrument, calibrations, in, astronomy, those, elements, with, higher, atomic, numbers, than, helium, are, termed, metals, the, metallicity, of, vega, s, photosphere, is, only, about, 32, of, the, abundance, of, heavy, elements, in, the, sun, s, atmosphere, compare, this, for, example, to, a, threefold, metallicity, abundance, in, the, similar, star, sirius, as, compared, to, the, sun, for, comparison, the, sun, has, an, abundance, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, of, about, z, sol, 0, 0172, 0, 002, thus, in, terms, of, abundances, only, about, 0, 54, of, vega, consists, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, nitrogen, is, slightly, more, abundant, oxygen, is, only, marginally, less, abundant, and, sulfur, abundance, is, about, 50, of, solar, on, the, other, hand, vega, has, only, 10, to, 30, of, the, solar, abundance, for, most, other, major, elements, with, barium, and, scandium, below, 10, the, unusually, low, metallicity, of, vega, makes, it, a, weak, lambda, bo, tis, star, however, the, reason, for, the, existence, of, such, chemically, peculiar, spectral, class, a0, f0, stars, remains, unclear, one, possibility, is, that, the, chemical, peculiarity, may, be, the, result, of, diffusion, or, mass, loss, although, stellar, models, show, that, this, would, normally, only, occur, near, the, end, of, a, star, s, hydrogen, burning, lifespan, another, possibility, is, that, the, star, formed, from, an, interstellar, medium, of, gas, and, dust, that, was, unusually, metal, poor, the, observed, helium, to, hydrogen, ratio, in, vega, is, 0, 030, 0, 005, which, is, about, 40, lower, than, the, sun, this, may, be, caused, by, the, disappearance, of, a, helium, convection, zone, near, the, surface, energy, transfer, is, instead, performed, by, the, radiative, process, which, may, be, causing, an, abundance, anomaly, through, diffusion, the, radial, velocity, of, vega, is, the, component, of, this, star, s, motion, along, the, line, of, sight, to, the, earth, movement, away, from, the, earth, will, cause, the, light, from, vega, to, shift, to, a, lower, frequency, toward, the, red, or, to, a, higher, frequency, toward, the, blue, if, the, motion, is, toward, the, earth, thus, the, velocity, can, be, measured, from, the, amount, of, shift, of, the, star, s, spectrum, precise, measurements, of, this, blueshift, give, a, value, of, 13, 9, 0, 9, km, s, the, minus, sign, indicates, a, relative, motion, toward, the, earth, motion, transverse, to, the, line, of, sight, causes, the, position, of, vega, to, shift, with, respect, to, the, more, distant, background, stars, careful, measurement, of, the, star, s, position, allows, this, angular, movement, known, as, proper, motion, to, be, calculated, vega, s, proper, motion, is, 202, 03, 0, 63, milliarcseconds, mas, per, year, in, right, ascension, the, celestial, equivalent, of, longitude, and, 287, 47, 0, 54, mas, y, in, declination, which, is, equivalent, to, a, change, in, latitude, the, net, proper, motion, of, vega, is, 327, 78, mas, y, which, results, in, angular, movement, of, a, degree, every, 11, 000, years, in, the, galactic, coordinate, system, the, space, velocity, components, of, vega, are, u, v, w, 16, 1, 0, 3, 6, 3, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 3, km, s, for, a, net, space, velocity, of, 19, km, s, the, radial, component, of, this, velocity, in, the, direction, of, the, sun, is, 13, 9, km, s, while, the, transverse, velocity, is, 12, 9, km, s, although, vega, is, at, present, only, the, fifth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, the, star, is, slowly, brightening, as, proper, motion, causes, it, to, approach, the, sun, vega, will, make, its, closest, approach, in, an, estimated, 264, 000, years, at, a, perihelion, distance, of, 13, 2, ly, 4, 04, pc, based, on, this, star, s, kinematic, properties, it, appears, to, belong, to, a, stellar, association, called, the, castor, moving, group, however, vega, may, be, much, older, than, this, group, so, the, membership, remains, uncertain, this, group, contains, about, 16, stars, including, alpha, librae, alpha, cephei, castor, fomalhaut, and, vega, all, members, of, the, group, are, moving, in, nearly, the, same, direction, with, similar, space, velocities, membership, in, a, moving, group, implies, a, common, origin, for, these, stars, in, an, open, cluster, that, has, since, become, gravitationally, unbound, the, estimated, age, of, this, moving, group, is, 200, 100, million, years, and, they, have, an, average, space, velocity, of, 16, 5, km, s, one, of, the, early, results, from, the, infrared, astronomy, satellite, iras, was, the, discovery, of, excess, infrared, flux, coming, from, vega, beyond, what, would, be, expected, from, the, star, alone, this, excess, was, measured, at, wavelengths, of, 25, 60, and, 100, m, and, came, from, within, an, angular, radius, of, 10, arcseconds, 10, centered, on, the, star, at, the, measured, distance, of, vega, this, corresponded, to, an, actual, radius, of, 80, astronomical, units, au, where, an, au, is, the, average, radius, of, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, it, was, proposed, that, this, radiation, came, from, a, field, of, orbiting, particles, with, a, dimension, on, the, order, of, a, millimetre, as, anything, smaller, would, eventually, be, removed, from, the, system, by, radiation, pressure, or, drawn, into, the, star, by, means, of, poynting, robertson, drag, the, latter, is, the, result, of, radiation, pressure, creating, an, effective, force, that, opposes, the, orbital, motion, of, a, dust, particle, causing, it, to, spiral, inward, this, effect, is, most, pronounced, for, tiny, particles, that, are, closer, to, the, star, subsequent, measurements, of, vega, at, 193, m, showed, a, lower, than, expected, flux, for, the, hypothesized, particles, suggesting, that, they, must, instead, be, on, the, order, of, 100, m, or, less, to, maintain, this, amount, of, dust, in, orbit, around, vega, a, continual, source, of, replenishment, would, be, required, a, proposed, mechanism, for, maintaining, the, dust, was, a, disk, of, coalesced, bodies, that, were, in, the, process, of, collapsing, to, form, a, planet, models, fitted, to, the, dust, distribution, around, vega, indicate, that, it, is, a, 120, astronomical, unit, radius, circular, disk, viewed, from, nearly, pole, on, in, addition, there, is, a, hole, in, the, center, of, the, disk, with, a, radius, of, no, less, than, 80, au, following, the, discovery, of, an, infrared, excess, around, vega, other, stars, have, been, found, that, display, a, similar, anomaly, that, is, attributable, to, dust, emission, as, of, 2002, about, 400, of, these, stars, have, been, found, and, they, have, come, to, be, termed, vega, like, or, vega, excess, stars, it, is, believed, that, these, may, provide, clues, to, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, by, 2005, the, spitzer, space, telescope, had, produced, high, resolution, infrared, images, of, the, dust, around, vega, it, was, shown, to, extend, out, to, 43, 330, au, at, a, wavelength, of, 24, m, 70, 543, au, at, 70, m, and, 105, 815, au, at, 160, m, these, much, wider, disks, were, found, to, be, circular, and, free, of, clumps, with, dust, particles, ranging, from, 1, 50, m, in, size, the, estimated, total, mass, of, this, dust, is, 3, 10, 3, times, the, mass, of, the, earth, around, 7, 5, times, more, massive, than, the, asteroid, belt, production, of, the, dust, would, require, collisions, between, asteroids, in, a, population, corresponding, to, the, kuiper, belt, around, the, sun, thus, the, dust, is, more, likely, created, by, a, debris, disk, around, vega, rather, than, from, a, protoplanetary, disk, as, was, earlier, thought, the, inner, boundary, of, the, debris, disk, was, estimated, at, 11, 2, or, 70, 100, au, the, disk, of, dust, is, produced, as, radiation, pressure, from, vega, pushes, debris, from, collisions, of, larger, objects, outward, however, continuous, production, of, the, amount, of, dust, observed, over, the, course, of, vega, s, lifetime, would, require, an, enormous, starting, mass, estimated, as, hundreds, of, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, hence, it, is, more, likely, to, have, been, produced, as, the, result, of, a, relatively, recent, breakup, of, a, moderate, sized, or, larger, comet, or, asteroid, which, then, further, fragmented, as, the, result, of, collisions, between, the, smaller, components, and, other, bodies, this, dusty, disk, would, be, relatively, young, on, the, time, scale, of, the, star, s, age, and, it, will, eventually, be, removed, unless, other, collision, events, supply, more, dust, observations, first, with, the, palomar, testbed, interferometer, by, david, ciardi, and, gerard, van, belle, in, 2001, and, then, later, confirmed, with, the, chara, array, at, mt, wilson, in, 2006, and, the, infrared, optical, telescope, array, at, mt, hopkins, in, 2011, revealed, evidence, for, an, inner, dust, band, around, vega, originating, within, 8, au, of, the, star, this, exozodiacal, dust, may, be, evidence, of, dynamical, perturbations, within, the, system, this, may, be, caused, by, an, intense, bombardment, of, comets, or, meteors, and, may, be, evidence, for, the, existence, of, a, planetary, system, observations, from, the, james, clerk, maxwell, telescope, in, 1997, revealed, an, elongated, bright, central, region, that, peaked, at, 9, 70, au, to, the, northeast, of, vega, this, was, hypothesized, as, either, a, perturbation, of, the, dust, disk, by, a, planet, or, else, an, orbiting, object, that, was, surrounded, by, dust, however, images, by, the, keck, telescope, had, ruled, out, a, companion, down, to, magnitude, 16, which, would, correspond, to, a, body, with, more, than, 12, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, astronomers, at, the, joint, astronomy, centre, in, hawaii, and, at, ucla, suggested, that, the, image, may, indicate, a, planetary, system, still, undergoing, formation, determining, the, nature, of, the, planet, has, not, been, straightforward, a, 2002, paper, hypothesizes, that, the, clumps, are, caused, by, a, roughly, jupiter, mass, planet, on, an, eccentric, orbit, dust, would, collect, in, orbits, that, have, mean, motion, resonances, with, this, planet, where, their, orbital, periods, form, integer, fractions, with, the, period, of, the, planet, producing, the, resulting, clumpiness, in, 2003, it, was, hypothesized, that, these, clumps, could, be, caused, by, a, roughly, neptune, mass, planet, having, migrated, from, 40, to, 65, au, over, 56, million, years, an, orbit, large, enough, to, allow, the, formation, of, smaller, rocky, planets, closer, to, vega, the, migration, of, this, planet, would, likely, require, gravitational, interaction, with, a, second, higher, mass, planet, in, a, smaller, orbit, using, a, coronagraph, on, the, subaru, telescope, in, hawaii, in, 2005, astronomers, were, able, to, further, constrain, the, size, of, a, planet, orbiting, vega, to, no, more, than, 5, 10, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, the, issue, of, possible, clumps, in, the, debris, disc, was, revisited, in, 2007, using, newer, more, sensitive, instrumentation, on, the, plateau, de, bure, interferometer, the, observations, showed, that, the, debris, ring, is, smooth, and, symmetric, no, evidence, was, found, of, the, blobs, reported, earlier, casting, doubts, on, the, hypothesized, giant, planet, the, smooth, structure, has, been, confirmed, in, follow, up, observations, by, hughes, et, al, 2012, and, the, herschel, space, telescope, although, a, planet, has, yet, to, be, directly, observed, around, vega, the, presence, of, a, planetary, system, cannot, yet, be, ruled, out, thus, there, could, be, smaller, terrestrial, planets, orbiting, closer, to, the, star, the, inclination, of, planetary, orbits, around, vega, is, likely, to, be, closely, aligned, to, the, equatorial, plane, of, this, star, from, the, perspective, of, an, observer, on, a, hypothetical, planet, around, vega, the, sun, would, appear, as, a, faint, 4, 3, magnitude, star, in, the, columba, constellation, in, 2021, a, paper, analyzing, 10, years, of, spectra, of, vega, detected, a, candidate, 2, 43, day, signal, around, vega, statistically, estimated, to, have, only, a, 1, chance, of, being, a, false, positive, considering, the, amplitude, of, the, signal, the, authors, estimated, a, minimum, mass, of, 21, 9, 5, 1, earth, masses, but, considering, the, very, oblique, rotation, of, vega, itself, of, only, 6, 2, from, earth, s, perspective, the, planet, may, be, aligned, to, this, plane, as, well, giving, it, an, actual, mass, of, 203, 47, earth, masses, the, researchers, also, detected, a, faint, 196, 4, 1, 6, 1, 9, day, signal, which, could, translate, to, 80, 21, earth, masses, 740, 190, at, 6, 2, inclination, but, is, too, faint, to, claim, as, a, real, signal, with, available, data, the, name, is, believed, to, be, derived, from, the, arabic, term, al, nesr, al, waki, which, appeared, in, the, al, achsasi, al, mouakket, star, catalogue, and, was, translated, into, latin, as, vultur, cadens, the, falling, eagle, vulture, the, constellation, was, represented, as, a, vulture, in, ancient, egypt, and, as, an, eagle, or, vulture, in, ancient, india, the, arabic, name, then, appeared, in, the, western, world, in, the, alfonsine, tables, which, were, drawn, up, between, 1215, and, 1270, by, order, of, king, alfonso, x, medieval, astrolabes, of, england, and, western, europe, used, the, names, wega, and, alvaca, and, depicted, it, and, altair, as, birds, among, the, northern, polynesian, people, vega, was, known, as, whetu, o, te, tau, the, year, star, for, a, period, of, history, it, marked, the, start, of, their, new, year, when, the, ground, would, be, prepared, for, planting, eventually, this, function, became, denoted, by, the, pleiades, the, assyrians, named, this, pole, star, dayan, same, the, judge, of, heaven, while, in, akkadian, it, was, tir, anna, life, of, heaven, in, babylonian, astronomy, vega, may, have, been, one, of, the, stars, named, dilgan, the, messenger, of, light, to, the, ancient, greeks, the, constellation, lyra, was, formed, from, the, harp, of, orpheus, with, vega, as, its, handle, for, the, roman, empire, the, start, of, autumn, was, based, upon, the, hour, at, which, vega, set, below, the, horizon, in, chinese, zh, n, meaning, weaving, girl, asterism, refers, to, an, asterism, consisting, of, vega, lyrae, and, 1, lyrae, consequently, the, chinese, name, for, vega, is, zh, n, y, english, the, first, star, of, weaving, girl, in, chinese, mythology, there, is, a, love, story, of, qixi, in, which, niulang, altair, and, his, two, children, aquilae, and, aquilae, are, separated, from, their, mother, zhin, lit, weaver, girl, vega, who, is, on, the, far, side, of, the, river, the, milky, way, however, one, day, per, year, on, the, seventh, day, of, the, seventh, month, of, the, chinese, lunisolar, calendar, magpies, make, a, bridge, so, that, niulang, and, zhin, can, be, together, again, for, a, brief, encounter, the, japanese, tanabata, festival, in, which, vega, is, known, as, orihime, is, also, based, on, this, legend, in, zoroastrianism, vega, was, sometimes, associated, with, vanant, a, minor, divinity, whose, name, means, conqueror, the, indigenous, boorong, people, of, north, western, victoria, australia, named, it, neilloan, the, flying, loan, in, the, srimad, bhagavatam, shri, krishna, tells, arjuna, that, among, the, nakshatras, he, is, abhijit, which, remark, indicates, the, auspiciousness, of, this, nakshatra, medieval, astrologers, counted, vega, as, one, of, the, behenian, stars, and, related, it, to, chrysolite, and, winter, savory, cornelius, agrippa, listed, its, kabbalistic, sign, under, vultur, cadens, a, literal, latin, translation, of, the, arabic, name, medieval, star, charts, also, listed, the, alternate, names, waghi, vagieh, and, veka, for, this, star, w, h, auden, s, 1933, poem, a, summer, night, to, geoffrey, hoyland, famously, opens, with, the, couplet, out, on, the, lawn, i, lie, in, bed, vega, conspicuous, overhead, vega, became, the, first, star, to, have, a, car, named, after, it, with, the, french, facel, vega, line, of, cars, from, 1954, onwards, and, later, on, in, america, chevrolet, launched, the, vega, in, 1971, other, vehicles, named, after, vega, include, the, esa, s, vega, launch, system, and, the, lockheed, vega, aircraft
