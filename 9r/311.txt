a, substitution, reaction, also, known, as, single, displacement, reaction, or, single, substitution, reaction, is, a, chemical, reaction, during, which, one, functional, group, in, a, chemical, compound, is, replaced, by, another, functional, group, substitution, reactions, are, of, prime, importance, in, organic, chemistry, substitution, reactions, in, organic, chemistry, are, classified, either, as, electrophilic, or, nucleophilic, depending, upon, the, reagent, involved, whether, a, reactive, intermediate, involved, in, the, reaction, is, a, carbocation, a, carbanion, or, a, free, radical, and, whether, the, substrate, is, aliphatic, or, aromatic, detailed, understanding, of, a, reaction, type, helps, to, predict, the, product, outcome, in, a, reaction, it, also, is, helpful, for, optimizing, a, reaction, with, regard, to, variables, such, as, temperature, and, choice, of, solvent, a, good, example, of, a, substitution, reaction, is, halogenation, when, chlorine, gas, cl, 2, is, irradiated, some, of, the, molecules, are, split, into, two, chlorine, radicals, cl, whose, free, electrons, are, strongly, nucleophilic, one, of, them, breaks, a, c, h, covalent, bond, in, ch, 4, and, grabs, the, hydrogen, atom, to, form, the, electrically, neutral, hcl, the, other, radical, reforms, a, covalent, bond, with, the, ch, 3, to, form, ch, 3, cl, methyl, chloride, in, organic, and, inorganic, chemistry, nucleophilic, substitution, is, a, fundamental, class, of, reactions, in, which, a, nucleophile, selectively, bonds, with, or, attacks, the, positive, or, partially, positive, charge, on, an, atom, or, a, group, of, atoms, as, it, does, so, it, replaces, a, weaker, nucleophile, which, then, becomes, a, leaving, group, the, remaining, positive, or, partially, positive, atom, becomes, an, electrophile, the, whole, molecular, entity, of, which, the, electrophile, and, the, leaving, group, are, part, is, usually, called, the, substrate, the, most, general, form, for, the, reaction, may, be, given, as, where, r, lg, indicates, the, substrate, the, electron, pair, from, the, nucleophile, nuc, attacks, the, substrate, r, lg, forming, a, new, covalent, bond, nuc, r, lg, the, prior, state, of, charge, is, restored, when, the, leaving, group, lg, departs, with, an, electron, pair, the, principal, product, in, this, case, is, r, nuc, in, such, reactions, the, nucleophile, is, usually, electrically, neutral, or, negatively, charged, whereas, the, substrate, is, typically, neutral, or, positively, charged, an, example, of, nucleophilic, substitution, is, the, hydrolysis, of, an, alkyl, bromide, r, br, under, basic, conditions, where, the, attacking, nucleophile, is, the, base, oh, and, the, leaving, group, is, br, nucleophilic, substitution, reactions, are, commonplace, in, organic, chemistry, and, they, can, be, broadly, categorized, as, taking, place, at, a, carbon, of, a, saturated, aliphatic, compound, carbon, or, less, often, at, an, aromatic, or, other, unsaturated, carbon, center, nucleophilic, substitutions, can, proceed, by, two, different, mechanisms, unimolecular, nucleophilic, substitution, s, n, 1, and, bimolecular, nucleophilic, substitution, s, n, 2, the, two, reactions, are, named, according, tho, their, rate, law, with, s, n, 1, having, a, first, order, rate, law, and, s, n, 2, having, a, second, order, the, s, n, 1, mechanism, has, two, steps, in, the, first, step, the, leaving, group, departs, forming, a, carbocation, c, in, the, second, step, the, nucleophilic, reagent, nuc, attaches, to, the, carbocation, and, forms, a, covalent, sigma, bond, if, the, substrate, has, a, chiral, carbon, this, mechanism, can, result, in, either, inversion, of, the, stereochemistry, or, retention, of, configuration, usually, both, occur, without, preference, the, result, is, racemization, the, stability, of, a, carbocation, c, depends, on, how, many, other, carbon, atoms, are, bonded, to, it, this, results, in, s, n, 1, reactions, usually, occurring, on, atoms, with, at, least, two, carbons, bonded, to, them, a, more, detailed, explanation, of, this, can, be, found, in, the, main, sn1, reaction, page, the, s, n, 2, mechanism, has, just, one, step, the, attack, of, the, reagent, and, the, expulsion, of, the, leaving, group, happen, simultaneously, this, mechanism, always, results, in, inversion, of, configuration, if, the, substrate, that, is, under, nucleophilic, attack, is, chiral, the, reaction, will, therefore, lead, to, an, inversion, of, its, stereochemistry, called, a, walden, inversion, s, n, 2, attack, may, occur, if, the, backside, route, of, attack, is, not, sterically, hindered, by, substituents, on, the, substrate, therefore, this, mechanism, usually, occurs, at, an, unhindered, primary, carbon, center, if, there, is, steric, crowding, on, the, substrate, near, the, leaving, group, such, as, at, a, tertiary, carbon, center, the, substitution, will, involve, an, s, n, 1, rather, than, an, s, n, 2, other, types, of, nucleophilic, substitution, include, nucleophilic, acyl, substitution, and, nucleophilic, aromatic, substitution, acyl, substitution, occurs, when, a, nucleophile, attacks, a, carbon, that, is, doubly, bonded, to, one, oxygen, and, singly, bonded, to, another, oxygen, can, be, n, or, s, or, a, halogen, called, an, acyl, group, the, nucleophile, attacks, the, carbon, causing, the, double, bond, to, break, into, a, single, bond, the, double, can, then, reform, kicking, off, the, leaving, group, in, the, process, aromatic, substitution, occurs, on, compounds, with, systems, of, double, bonds, connected, in, rings, see, aromatic, compounds, for, more, electrophiles, are, involved, in, electrophilic, substitution, reactions, particularly, in, electrophilic, aromatic, substitutions, in, this, example, the, benzene, ring, s, electron, resonance, structure, is, attacked, by, an, electrophile, e, the, resonating, bond, is, broken, and, a, carbocation, resonating, structure, results, finally, a, proton, is, kicked, out, and, a, new, aromatic, compound, is, formed, 2b, resonance, of, benzene, electrophile, intermediate, 3, substituted, reaction, product, electrophilic, reactions, to, other, unsaturated, compounds, than, arenes, generally, lead, to, electrophilic, addition, rather, than, substitution, a, radical, substitution, reaction, involves, radicals, an, example, is, the, hunsdiecker, reaction, coupling, reactions, are, a, class, of, metal, catalyzed, reactions, involving, an, organometallic, compound, rm, and, an, organic, halide, r, x, that, together, react, to, form, a, compound, of, the, type, r, r, with, formation, of, a, new, carbon, carbon, bond, examples, include, the, heck, reaction, ullmann, reaction, and, wurtz, fittig, reaction, many, variations, exist, substituted, compounds, are, compounds, where, one, or, more, hydrogen, atoms, have, been, replaced, with, something, else, such, as, an, alkyl, hydroxy, or, halogen, more, can, be, found, on, the, substituted, compounds, page, while, it, is, common, to, discuss, substitution, reactions, in, the, context, of, organic, chemistry, the, reaction, is, generic, and, applies, to, a, wide, range, of, compounds, ligands, in, coordination, complexes, are, susceptible, to, substitution, both, associative, and, dissociative, mechanisms, have, been, observed, associative, substitution, for, example, is, typically, applied, to, organometallic, and, coordination, complexes, but, resembles, the, sn2, mechanism, in, organic, chemistry, the, opposite, pathway, is, dissociative, substitution, being, analogous, to, the, sn1, pathway, examples, of, associative, mechanisms, are, commonly, found, in, the, chemistry, of, 16e, square, planar, metal, complexes, e, g, vaska, s, complex, and, tetrachloroplatinate, the, rate, law, is, governed, by, the, eigen, wilkins, mechanism, dissociative, substitution, resembles, the, s, n, 1, mechanism, in, organic, chemistry, this, pathway, can, be, well, described, by, the, cis, effect, or, the, labilization, of, co, ligands, in, the, cis, position, complexes, that, undergo, dissociative, substitution, are, often, coordinatively, saturated, and, often, have, octahedral, molecular, geometry, the, entropy, of, activation, is, characteristically, positive, for, these, reactions, which, indicates, that, the, disorder, of, the, reacting, system, increases, in, the, rate, determining, step, dissociative, pathways, are, characterized, by, a, rate, determining, step, that, involves, release, of, a, ligand, from, the, coordination, sphere, of, the, metal, undergoing, substitution, the, concentration, of, the, substituting, nucleophile, has, no, influence, on, this, rate, and, an, intermediate, of, reduced, coordination, number, can, be, detected, the, reaction, can, be, described, with, k, 1, k, 1, and, k, 2, which, are, the, rate, constants, of, their, corresponding, intermediate, reaction, steps, normally, the, rate, determining, step, is, the, dissociation, of, l, from, the, complex, and, does, not, affect, the, rate, of, reaction, leading, to, the, simple, rate, equation
