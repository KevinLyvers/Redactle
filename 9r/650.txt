a, coral, reef, is, an, underwater, ecosystem, characterized, by, reef, building, corals, reefs, are, formed, of, colonies, of, coral, polyps, held, together, by, calcium, carbonate, most, coral, reefs, are, built, from, stony, corals, whose, polyps, cluster, in, groups, coral, belongs, to, the, class, anthozoa, in, the, animal, phylum, cnidaria, which, includes, sea, anemones, and, jellyfish, unlike, sea, anemones, corals, secrete, hard, carbonate, exoskeletons, that, support, and, protect, the, coral, most, reefs, grow, best, in, warm, shallow, clear, sunny, and, agitated, water, coral, reefs, first, appeared, 485, million, years, ago, at, the, dawn, of, the, early, ordovician, displacing, the, microbial, and, sponge, reefs, of, the, cambrian, sometimes, called, rainforests, of, the, sea, shallow, coral, reefs, form, some, of, earth, s, most, diverse, ecosystems, they, occupy, less, than, 0, 1, of, the, world, s, ocean, area, about, half, the, area, of, france, yet, they, provide, a, home, for, at, least, 25, of, all, marine, species, including, fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates, and, other, cnidarians, coral, reefs, flourish, in, ocean, waters, that, provide, few, nutrients, they, are, most, commonly, found, at, shallow, depths, in, tropical, waters, but, deep, water, and, cold, water, coral, reefs, exist, on, smaller, scales, in, other, areas, shallow, tropical, coral, reefs, have, declined, by, 50, since, 1950, partly, because, they, are, sensitive, to, water, conditions, they, are, under, threat, from, excess, nutrients, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, rising, ocean, heat, content, and, acidification, overfishing, e, g, from, blast, fishing, cyanide, fishing, spearfishing, on, scuba, sunscreen, use, and, harmful, land, use, practices, including, runoff, and, seeps, e, g, from, injection, wells, and, cesspools, coral, reefs, deliver, ecosystem, services, for, tourism, fisheries, and, shoreline, protection, the, annual, global, economic, value, of, coral, reefs, has, been, estimated, at, anywhere, from, us, 30, 375, billion, 1997, and, 2003, estimates, to, us, 2, 7, trillion, a, 2020, estimate, to, us, 9, 9, trillion, a, 2014, estimate, though, the, shallow, water, tropical, coral, reefs, are, best, known, there, are, also, deeper, water, reef, forming, corals, which, live, in, colder, water, and, in, temperate, seas, most, coral, reefs, were, formed, after, the, last, glacial, period, when, melting, ice, caused, sea, level, to, rise, and, flood, continental, shelves, most, coral, reefs, are, less, than, 10, 000, years, old, as, communities, established, themselves, the, reefs, grew, upwards, pacing, rising, sea, levels, reefs, that, rose, too, slowly, could, become, drowned, without, sufficient, light, coral, reefs, are, also, found, in, the, deep, sea, away, from, continental, shelves, around, oceanic, islands, and, atolls, the, majority, of, these, islands, are, volcanic, in, origin, others, have, tectonic, origins, where, plate, movements, lifted, the, deep, ocean, floor, in, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, charles, darwin, set, out, his, theory, of, the, formation, of, atoll, reefs, an, idea, he, conceived, during, the, voyage, of, the, beagle, he, theorized, that, uplift, and, subsidence, of, earth, s, crust, under, the, oceans, formed, the, atolls, darwin, set, out, a, sequence, of, three, stages, in, atoll, formation, a, fringing, reef, forms, around, an, extinct, volcanic, island, as, the, island, and, ocean, floor, subside, as, the, subsidence, continues, the, fringing, reef, becomes, a, barrier, reef, and, ultimately, an, atoll, reef, darwin, predicted, that, underneath, each, lagoon, would, be, a, bedrock, base, the, remains, of, the, original, volcano, subsequent, research, supported, this, hypothesis, darwin, s, theory, followed, from, his, understanding, that, coral, polyps, thrive, in, the, tropics, where, the, water, is, agitated, but, can, only, live, within, a, limited, depth, range, starting, just, below, low, tide, where, the, level, of, the, underlying, earth, allows, the, corals, grow, around, the, coast, to, form, fringing, reefs, and, can, eventually, grow, to, become, a, barrier, reef, where, the, bottom, is, rising, fringing, reefs, can, grow, around, the, coast, but, coral, raised, above, sea, level, dies, if, the, land, subsides, slowly, the, fringing, reefs, keep, pace, by, growing, upwards, on, a, base, of, older, dead, coral, forming, a, barrier, reef, enclosing, a, lagoon, between, the, reef, and, the, land, a, barrier, reef, can, encircle, an, island, and, once, the, island, sinks, below, sea, level, a, roughly, circular, atoll, of, growing, coral, continues, to, keep, up, with, the, sea, level, forming, a, central, lagoon, barrier, reefs, and, atolls, do, not, usually, form, complete, circles, but, are, broken, in, places, by, storms, like, sea, level, rise, a, rapidly, subsiding, bottom, can, overwhelm, coral, growth, killing, the, coral, and, the, reef, due, to, what, is, called, coral, drowning, corals, that, rely, on, zooxanthellae, can, die, when, the, water, becomes, too, deep, for, their, symbionts, to, adequately, photosynthesize, due, to, decreased, light, exposure, the, two, main, variables, determining, the, geomorphology, or, shape, of, coral, reefs, are, the, nature, of, the, substrate, on, which, they, rest, and, the, history, of, the, change, in, sea, level, relative, to, that, substrate, the, approximately, 20, 000, year, old, great, barrier, reef, offers, an, example, of, how, coral, reefs, formed, on, continental, shelves, sea, level, was, then, 120, m, 390, ft, lower, than, in, the, 21st, century, as, sea, level, rose, the, water, and, the, corals, encroached, on, what, had, been, hills, of, the, australian, coastal, plain, by, 13, 000, years, ago, sea, level, had, risen, to, 60, m, 200, ft, lower, than, at, present, and, many, hills, of, the, coastal, plains, had, become, continental, islands, as, sea, level, rise, continued, water, topped, most, of, the, continental, islands, the, corals, could, then, overgrow, the, hills, forming, cays, and, reefs, sea, level, on, the, great, barrier, reef, has, not, changed, significantly, in, the, last, 6, 000, years, the, age, of, living, reef, structure, is, estimated, to, be, between, 6, 000, and, 8, 000, years, although, the, great, barrier, reef, formed, along, a, continental, shelf, and, not, around, a, volcanic, island, darwin, s, principles, apply, development, stopped, at, the, barrier, reef, stage, since, australia, is, not, about, to, submerge, it, formed, the, world, s, largest, barrier, reef, 300, 1, 000, m, 980, 3, 280, ft, from, shore, stretching, for, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, healthy, tropical, coral, reefs, grow, horizontally, from, 1, to, 3, cm, 0, 39, to, 1, 18, in, per, year, and, grow, vertically, anywhere, from, 1, to, 25, cm, 0, 39, to, 9, 84, in, per, year, however, they, grow, only, at, depths, shallower, than, 150, m, 490, ft, because, of, their, need, for, sunlight, and, cannot, grow, above, sea, level, as, the, name, implies, coral, reefs, are, made, up, of, coral, skeletons, from, mostly, intact, coral, colonies, as, other, chemical, elements, present, in, corals, become, incorporated, into, the, calcium, carbonate, deposits, aragonite, is, formed, however, shell, fragments, and, the, remains, of, coralline, algae, such, as, the, green, segmented, genus, halimeda, can, add, to, the, reef, s, ability, to, withstand, damage, from, storms, and, other, threats, such, mixtures, are, visible, in, structures, such, as, eniwetok, atoll, the, times, of, maximum, reef, development, were, in, the, middle, cambrian, 513, 501, ma, devonian, 416, 359, ma, and, carboniferous, 359, 299, ma, owing, to, extinct, order, rugosa, corals, and, late, cretaceous, 100, 66, ma, and, neogene, 23, ma, present, owing, to, order, scleractinia, corals, not, all, reefs, in, the, past, were, formed, by, corals, those, in, the, early, cambrian, 542, 513, ma, resulted, from, calcareous, algae, and, archaeocyathids, small, animals, with, conical, shape, probably, related, to, sponges, and, in, the, late, cretaceous, 100, 66, ma, when, reefs, formed, by, a, group, of, bivalves, called, rudists, existed, one, of, the, valves, formed, the, main, conical, structure, and, the, other, much, smaller, valve, acted, as, a, cap, measurements, of, the, oxygen, isotopic, composition, of, the, aragonitic, skeleton, of, coral, reefs, such, as, porites, can, indicate, changes, in, sea, surface, temperature, and, sea, surface, salinity, conditions, during, the, growth, of, the, coral, this, technique, is, often, used, by, climate, scientists, to, infer, a, region, s, paleoclimate, since, darwin, s, identification, of, the, three, classical, reef, formations, the, fringing, reef, around, a, volcanic, island, becoming, a, barrier, reef, and, then, an, atoll, scientists, have, identified, further, reef, types, while, some, sources, find, only, three, thomas, lists, four, major, forms, of, large, scale, coral, reefs, the, fringing, reef, barrier, reef, atoll, and, table, reef, based, on, stoddart, d, r, 1969, spalding, et, al, list, four, main, reef, types, that, can, be, clearly, illustrated, the, fringing, reef, barrier, reef, atoll, and, bank, or, platform, reef, and, notes, that, many, other, structures, exist, which, do, not, conform, easily, to, strict, definitions, including, the, patch, reef, a, fringing, reef, also, called, a, shore, reef, is, directly, attached, to, a, shore, or, borders, it, with, an, intervening, narrow, shallow, channel, or, lagoon, it, is, the, most, common, reef, type, fringing, reefs, follow, coastlines, and, can, extend, for, many, kilometres, they, are, usually, less, than, 100, metres, wide, but, some, are, hundreds, of, metres, wide, fringing, reefs, are, initially, formed, on, the, shore, at, the, low, water, level, and, expand, seawards, as, they, grow, in, size, the, final, width, depends, on, where, the, sea, bed, begins, to, drop, steeply, the, surface, of, the, fringe, reef, generally, remains, at, the, same, height, just, below, the, waterline, in, older, fringing, reefs, whose, outer, regions, pushed, far, out, into, the, sea, the, inner, part, is, deepened, by, erosion, and, eventually, forms, a, lagoon, fringing, reef, lagoons, can, become, over, 100, metres, wide, and, several, metres, deep, like, the, fringing, reef, itself, they, run, parallel, to, the, coast, the, fringing, reefs, of, the, red, sea, are, some, of, the, best, developed, in, the, world, and, occur, along, all, its, shores, except, off, sandy, bays, barrier, reefs, are, separated, from, a, mainland, or, island, shore, by, a, deep, channel, or, lagoon, they, resemble, the, later, stages, of, a, fringing, reef, with, its, lagoon, but, differ, from, the, latter, mainly, in, size, and, origin, their, lagoons, can, be, several, kilometres, wide, and, 30, to, 70, metres, deep, above, all, the, offshore, outer, reef, edge, formed, in, open, water, rather, than, next, to, a, shoreline, like, an, atoll, it, is, thought, that, these, reefs, are, formed, either, as, the, seabed, lowered, or, sea, level, rose, formation, takes, considerably, longer, than, for, a, fringing, reef, thus, barrier, reefs, are, much, rarer, the, best, known, and, largest, example, of, a, barrier, reef, is, the, australian, great, barrier, reef, other, major, examples, are, the, mesoamerican, barrier, reef, system, and, the, new, caledonian, barrier, reef, barrier, reefs, are, also, found, on, the, coasts, of, providencia, mayotte, the, gambier, islands, on, the, southeast, coast, of, kalimantan, on, parts, of, the, coast, of, sulawesi, southeastern, new, guinea, and, the, south, coast, of, the, louisiade, archipelago, platform, reefs, variously, called, bank, or, table, reefs, can, form, on, the, continental, shelf, as, well, as, in, the, open, ocean, in, fact, anywhere, where, the, seabed, rises, close, enough, to, the, surface, of, the, ocean, to, enable, the, growth, of, zooxanthemic, reef, forming, corals, platform, reefs, are, found, in, the, southern, great, barrier, reef, the, swain, and, capricorn, group, on, the, continental, shelf, about, 100, 200, km, from, the, coast, some, platform, reefs, of, the, northern, mascarenes, are, several, thousand, kilometres, from, the, mainland, unlike, fringing, and, barrier, reefs, which, extend, only, seaward, platform, reefs, grow, in, all, directions, they, are, variable, in, size, ranging, from, a, few, hundred, metres, to, many, kilometres, across, their, usual, shape, is, oval, to, elongated, parts, of, these, reefs, can, reach, the, surface, and, form, sandbanks, and, small, islands, around, which, may, form, fringing, reefs, a, lagoon, may, form, in, the, middle, of, a, platform, reef, platform, reefs, are, typically, situated, within, atolls, where, they, adopt, the, name, patch, reefs, and, often, span, a, diameter, of, just, a, few, dozen, meters, in, instances, where, platform, reefs, develop, along, elongated, structures, such, as, old, and, weathered, barrier, reefs, they, tend, to, arrange, themselves, in, a, linear, formation, this, is, the, case, for, example, on, the, east, coast, of, the, red, sea, near, jeddah, in, old, platform, reefs, the, inner, part, can, be, so, heavily, eroded, that, it, forms, a, pseudo, atoll, these, can, be, distinguished, from, real, atolls, only, by, detailed, investigation, possibly, including, core, drilling, some, platform, reefs, of, the, laccadives, are, u, shaped, due, to, wind, and, water, flow, atolls, or, atoll, reefs, are, a, more, or, less, circular, or, continuous, barrier, reef, that, extends, all, the, way, around, a, lagoon, without, a, central, island, they, are, usually, formed, from, fringing, reefs, around, volcanic, islands, over, time, the, island, erodes, away, and, sinks, below, sea, level, atolls, may, also, be, formed, by, the, sinking, of, the, seabed, or, rising, of, the, sea, level, a, ring, of, reefs, results, which, enclose, a, lagoon, atolls, are, numerous, in, the, south, pacific, where, they, usually, occur, in, mid, ocean, for, example, in, the, caroline, islands, the, cook, islands, french, polynesia, the, marshall, islands, and, micronesia, atolls, are, found, in, the, indian, ocean, for, example, in, the, maldives, the, chagos, islands, the, seychelles, and, around, cocos, island, the, entire, maldives, consist, of, 26, atolls, coral, reef, ecosystems, contain, distinct, zones, that, host, different, kinds, of, habitats, usually, three, major, zones, are, recognized, the, fore, reef, reef, crest, and, the, back, reef, frequently, referred, to, as, the, reef, lagoon, the, three, zones, are, physically, and, ecologically, interconnected, reef, life, and, oceanic, processes, create, opportunities, for, the, exchange, of, seawater, sediments, nutrients, and, marine, life, most, coral, reefs, exist, in, waters, less, than, 50, m, deep, some, inhabit, tropical, continental, shelves, where, cool, nutrient, rich, upwelling, does, not, occur, such, as, the, great, barrier, reef, others, are, found, in, the, deep, ocean, surrounding, islands, or, as, atolls, such, as, in, the, maldives, the, reefs, surrounding, islands, form, when, islands, subside, into, the, ocean, and, atolls, form, when, an, island, subsides, below, the, surface, of, the, sea, alternatively, moyle, and, cech, distinguish, six, zones, though, most, reefs, possess, only, some, of, the, zones, the, reef, surface, is, the, shallowest, part, of, the, reef, it, is, subject, to, surge, and, tides, when, waves, pass, over, shallow, areas, they, shoal, as, shown, in, the, adjacent, diagram, this, means, the, water, is, often, agitated, these, are, the, precise, condition, under, which, corals, flourish, the, light, is, sufficient, for, photosynthesis, by, the, symbiotic, zooxanthellae, and, agitated, water, brings, plankton, to, feed, the, coral, the, off, reef, floor, is, the, shallow, sea, floor, surrounding, a, reef, this, zone, occurs, next, to, reefs, on, continental, shelves, reefs, around, tropical, islands, and, atolls, drop, abruptly, to, great, depths, and, do, not, have, such, a, floor, usually, sandy, the, floor, often, supports, seagrass, meadows, which, are, important, foraging, areas, for, reef, fish, the, reef, drop, off, is, for, its, first, 50, m, habitat, for, reef, fish, who, find, shelter, on, the, cliff, face, and, plankton, in, the, water, nearby, the, drop, off, zone, applies, mainly, to, the, reefs, surrounding, oceanic, islands, and, atolls, the, reef, face, is, the, zone, above, the, reef, floor, or, the, reef, drop, off, this, zone, is, often, the, reef, s, most, diverse, area, coral, and, calcareous, algae, provide, complex, habitats, and, areas, that, offer, protection, such, as, cracks, and, crevices, invertebrates, and, epiphytic, algae, provide, much, of, the, food, for, other, organisms, a, common, feature, on, this, forereef, zone, is, spur, and, groove, formations, that, serve, to, transport, sediment, downslope, the, reef, flat, is, the, sandy, bottomed, flat, which, can, be, behind, the, main, reef, containing, chunks, of, coral, this, zone, may, border, a, lagoon, and, serve, as, a, protective, area, or, it, may, lie, between, the, reef, and, the, shore, and, in, this, case, is, a, flat, rocky, area, fish, tend, to, prefer, it, when, it, is, present, the, reef, lagoon, is, an, entirely, enclosed, region, which, creates, an, area, less, affected, by, wave, action, and, often, contains, small, reef, patches, however, the, topography, of, coral, reefs, is, constantly, changing, each, reef, is, made, up, of, irregular, patches, of, algae, sessile, invertebrates, and, bare, rock, and, sand, the, size, shape, and, relative, abundance, of, these, patches, change, from, year, to, year, in, response, to, the, various, factors, that, favor, one, type, of, patch, over, another, growing, coral, for, example, produces, constant, change, in, the, fine, structure, of, reefs, on, a, larger, scale, tropical, storms, may, knock, out, large, sections, of, reef, and, cause, boulders, on, sandy, areas, to, move, coral, reefs, are, estimated, to, cover, 284, 300, km, 2, 109, 800, sq, mi, just, under, 0, 1, of, the, oceans, surface, area, the, indo, pacific, region, including, the, red, sea, indian, ocean, southeast, asia, and, the, pacific, account, for, 91, 9, of, this, total, southeast, asia, accounts, for, 32, 3, of, that, figure, while, the, pacific, including, australia, accounts, for, 40, 8, atlantic, and, caribbean, coral, reefs, account, for, 7, 6, although, corals, exist, both, in, temperate, and, tropical, waters, shallow, water, reefs, form, only, in, a, zone, extending, from, approximately, 30, n, to, 30, s, of, the, equator, tropical, corals, do, not, grow, at, depths, of, over, 50, meters, 160, ft, the, optimum, temperature, for, most, coral, reefs, is, 26, 27, c, 79, 81, f, and, few, reefs, exist, in, waters, below, 18, c, 64, f, when, the, net, production, by, reef, building, corals, no, longer, keeps, pace, with, relative, sea, level, and, the, reef, structure, permanently, drowns, a, darwin, point, is, reached, one, such, point, exists, at, the, northwestern, end, of, the, hawaiian, archipelago, see, evolution, of, hawaiian, volcanoes, coral, atoll, stage, however, reefs, in, the, persian, gulf, have, adapted, to, temperatures, of, 13, c, 55, f, in, winter, and, 38, c, 100, f, in, summer, 37, species, of, scleractinian, corals, inhabit, such, an, environment, around, larak, island, deep, water, coral, inhabits, greater, depths, and, colder, temperatures, at, much, higher, latitudes, as, far, north, as, norway, although, deep, water, corals, can, form, reefs, little, is, known, about, them, the, northernmost, coral, reef, on, earth, is, located, near, eilat, israel, coral, reefs, are, rare, along, the, west, coasts, of, the, americas, and, africa, due, primarily, to, upwelling, and, strong, cold, coastal, currents, that, reduce, water, temperatures, in, these, areas, the, humboldt, benguela, and, canary, currents, respectively, corals, are, seldom, found, along, the, coastline, of, south, asia, from, the, eastern, tip, of, india, chennai, to, the, bangladesh, and, myanmar, borders, as, well, as, along, the, coasts, of, northeastern, south, america, and, bangladesh, due, to, the, freshwater, release, from, the, amazon, and, ganges, rivers, respectively, significant, coral, reefs, include, when, alive, corals, are, colonies, of, small, animals, embedded, in, calcium, carbonate, shells, coral, heads, consist, of, accumulations, of, individual, animals, called, polyps, arranged, in, diverse, shapes, polyps, are, usually, tiny, but, they, can, range, in, size, from, a, pinhead, to, 12, inches, 30, cm, across, reef, building, or, hermatypic, corals, live, only, in, the, photic, zone, above, 70, m, the, depth, to, which, sufficient, sunlight, penetrates, the, water, coral, polyps, do, not, photosynthesize, but, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, microscopic, algae, dinoflagellates, of, the, genus, symbiodinium, commonly, referred, to, as, zooxanthellae, these, organisms, live, within, the, polyps, tissues, and, provide, organic, nutrients, that, nourish, the, polyp, in, the, form, of, glucose, glycerol, and, amino, acids, because, of, this, relationship, coral, reefs, grow, much, faster, in, clear, water, which, admits, more, sunlight, without, their, symbionts, coral, growth, would, be, too, slow, to, form, significant, reef, structures, corals, get, up, to, 90, of, their, nutrients, from, their, symbionts, in, return, as, an, example, of, mutualism, the, corals, shelter, the, zooxanthellae, averaging, one, million, for, every, cubic, centimetre, of, coral, and, provide, a, constant, supply, of, the, carbon, dioxide, they, need, for, photosynthesis, the, varying, pigments, in, different, species, of, zooxanthellae, give, them, an, overall, brown, or, golden, brown, appearance, and, give, brown, corals, their, colors, other, pigments, such, as, reds, blues, greens, etc, come, from, colored, proteins, made, by, the, coral, animals, coral, that, loses, a, large, fraction, of, its, zooxanthellae, becomes, white, or, sometimes, pastel, shades, in, corals, that, are, pigmented, with, their, own, proteins, and, is, said, to, be, bleached, a, condition, which, unless, corrected, can, kill, the, coral, there, are, eight, clades, of, symbiodinium, phylotypes, most, research, has, been, conducted, on, clades, a, d, each, clade, contributes, their, own, benefits, as, well, as, less, compatible, attributes, to, the, survival, of, their, coral, hosts, each, photosynthetic, organism, has, a, specific, level, of, sensitivity, to, photodamage, to, compounds, needed, for, survival, such, as, proteins, rates, of, regeneration, and, replication, determine, the, organism, s, ability, to, survive, phylotype, a, is, found, more, in, the, shallow, waters, it, is, able, to, produce, mycosporine, like, amino, acids, that, are, uv, resistant, using, a, derivative, of, glycerin, to, absorb, the, uv, radiation, and, allowing, them, to, better, adapt, to, warmer, water, temperatures, in, the, event, of, uv, or, thermal, damage, if, and, when, repair, occurs, it, will, increase, the, likelihood, of, survival, of, the, host, and, symbiont, this, leads, to, the, idea, that, evolutionarily, clade, a, is, more, uv, resistant, and, thermally, resistant, than, the, other, clades, clades, b, and, c, are, found, more, frequently, in, deeper, water, which, may, explain, their, higher, vulnerability, to, increased, temperatures, terrestrial, plants, that, receive, less, sunlight, because, they, are, found, in, the, undergrowth, are, analogous, to, clades, b, c, and, d, since, clades, b, through, d, are, found, at, deeper, depths, they, require, an, elevated, light, absorption, rate, to, be, able, to, synthesize, as, much, energy, with, elevated, absorption, rates, at, uv, wavelengths, these, phylotypes, are, more, prone, to, coral, bleaching, versus, the, shallow, clade, a, clade, d, has, been, observed, to, be, high, temperature, tolerant, and, has, a, higher, rate, of, survival, than, clades, b, and, c, during, modern, bleaching, events, reefs, grow, as, polyps, and, other, organisms, deposit, calcium, carbonate, the, basis, of, coral, as, a, skeletal, structure, beneath, and, around, themselves, pushing, the, coral, head, s, top, upwards, and, outwards, waves, grazing, fish, such, as, parrotfish, sea, urchins, sponges, and, other, forces, and, organisms, act, as, bioeroders, breaking, down, coral, skeletons, into, fragments, that, settle, into, spaces, in, the, reef, structure, or, form, sandy, bottoms, in, associated, reef, lagoons, typical, shapes, for, coral, species, are, named, by, their, resemblance, to, terrestrial, objects, such, as, wrinkled, brains, cabbages, table, tops, antlers, wire, strands, and, pillars, these, shapes, can, depend, on, the, life, history, of, the, coral, like, light, exposure, and, wave, action, and, events, such, as, breakages, corals, reproduce, both, sexually, and, asexually, an, individual, polyp, uses, both, reproductive, modes, within, its, lifetime, corals, reproduce, sexually, by, either, internal, or, external, fertilization, the, reproductive, cells, are, found, on, the, mesenteries, membranes, that, radiate, inward, from, the, layer, of, tissue, that, lines, the, stomach, cavity, some, mature, adult, corals, are, hermaphroditic, others, are, exclusively, male, or, female, a, few, species, change, sex, as, they, grow, internally, fertilized, eggs, develop, in, the, polyp, for, a, period, ranging, from, days, to, weeks, subsequent, development, produces, a, tiny, larva, known, as, a, planula, externally, fertilized, eggs, develop, during, synchronized, spawning, polyps, across, a, reef, simultaneously, release, eggs, and, sperm, into, the, water, en, masse, spawn, disperse, over, a, large, area, the, timing, of, spawning, depends, on, time, of, year, water, temperature, and, tidal, and, lunar, cycles, spawning, is, most, successful, given, little, variation, between, high, and, low, tide, the, less, water, movement, the, better, the, chance, for, fertilization, the, release, of, eggs, or, planula, usually, occurs, at, night, and, is, sometimes, in, phase, with, the, lunar, cycle, three, to, six, days, after, a, full, moon, the, period, from, release, to, settlement, lasts, only, a, few, days, but, some, planulae, can, survive, afloat, for, several, weeks, during, this, process, the, larvae, may, use, several, different, cues, to, find, a, suitable, location, for, settlement, at, long, distances, sounds, from, existing, reefs, are, likely, important, while, at, short, distances, chemical, compounds, become, important, the, larvae, are, vulnerable, to, predation, and, environmental, conditions, the, lucky, few, planulae, that, successfully, attach, to, substrate, then, compete, for, food, and, space, corals, are, the, most, prodigious, reef, builders, however, many, other, organisms, living, in, the, reef, community, contribute, skeletal, calcium, carbonate, in, the, same, manner, as, corals, these, include, coralline, algae, some, sponges, and, bivalves, reefs, are, always, built, by, the, combined, efforts, of, these, different, phyla, with, different, organisms, leading, reef, building, in, different, geological, periods, coralline, algae, are, important, contributors, to, reef, structure, although, their, mineral, deposition, rates, are, much, slower, than, corals, they, are, more, tolerant, of, rough, wave, action, and, so, help, to, create, a, protective, crust, over, those, parts, of, the, reef, subjected, to, the, greatest, forces, by, waves, such, as, the, reef, front, facing, the, open, ocean, they, also, strengthen, the, reef, structure, by, depositing, limestone, in, sheets, over, the, reef, surface, sclerosponge, is, the, descriptive, name, for, all, porifera, that, build, reefs, in, the, early, cambrian, period, archaeocyatha, sponges, were, the, world, s, first, reef, building, organisms, and, sponges, were, the, only, reef, builders, until, the, ordovician, sclerosponges, still, assist, corals, building, modern, reefs, but, like, coralline, algae, are, much, slower, growing, than, corals, and, their, contribution, is, usually, minor, in, the, northern, pacific, ocean, cloud, sponges, still, create, deep, water, mineral, structures, without, corals, although, the, structures, are, not, recognizable, from, the, surface, like, tropical, reefs, they, are, the, only, extant, organisms, known, to, build, reef, like, structures, in, cold, water, oyster, reefs, are, dense, aggregations, of, oysters, living, in, colonial, communities, other, regionally, specific, names, for, these, structures, include, oyster, beds, and, oyster, banks, oyster, larvae, require, a, hard, substrate, or, surface, to, attach, on, which, includes, the, shells, of, old, or, dead, oysters, thus, reefs, can, build, up, over, time, as, new, larvae, settle, on, older, individuals, crassostrea, virginica, were, once, abundant, in, chesapeake, bay, and, shorelines, bordering, the, atlantic, coastal, plain, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, ostrea, angasi, is, a, species, of, flat, oyster, that, had, also, formed, large, reefs, in, south, australia, hippuritida, an, extinct, order, of, bivalves, known, as, rudists, were, major, reef, building, organisms, during, the, cretaceous, by, the, mid, cretaceous, rudists, became, the, dominant, tropical, reef, builders, becoming, more, numerous, than, scleractinian, corals, during, this, period, ocean, temperatures, and, saline, levels, which, corals, are, sensitive, to, were, higher, than, it, is, today, which, may, have, contributed, to, the, success, of, rudist, reefs, some, gastropods, like, family, vermetidae, are, sessile, and, cement, themselves, to, the, substrate, contributing, to, the, reef, building, coral, seems, to, proliferate, when, ocean, waters, are, warm, poor, clear, and, agitated, a, fact, which, darwin, had, already, noted, when, he, passed, through, tahiti, in, 1842, this, constitutes, a, fundamental, paradox, shown, quantitatively, by, the, apparent, impossibility, of, balancing, input, and, output, of, the, nutritive, elements, which, control, the, coral, polyp, metabolism, recent, oceanographic, research, has, brought, to, light, the, reality, of, this, paradox, by, confirming, that, the, oligotrophy, of, the, ocean, euphotic, zone, persists, right, up, to, the, swell, battered, reef, crest, when, you, approach, the, reef, edges, and, atolls, from, the, quasidesert, of, the, open, sea, the, near, absence, of, living, matter, suddenly, becomes, a, plethora, of, life, without, transition, so, why, is, there, something, rather, than, nothing, and, more, precisely, where, do, the, necessary, nutrients, for, the, functioning, of, this, extraordinary, coral, reef, machine, come, from, francis, rougerie, in, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, published, in, 1842, darwin, described, how, coral, reefs, were, found, in, some, tropical, areas, but, not, others, with, no, obvious, cause, the, largest, and, strongest, corals, grew, in, parts, of, the, reef, exposed, to, the, most, violent, surf, and, corals, were, weakened, or, absent, where, loose, sediment, accumulated, tropical, waters, contain, few, nutrients, yet, a, coral, reef, can, flourish, like, an, oasis, in, the, desert, this, has, given, rise, to, the, ecosystem, conundrum, sometimes, called, darwin, s, paradox, how, can, such, high, production, flourish, in, such, nutrient, poor, conditions, coral, reefs, support, over, one, quarter, of, all, marine, species, this, diversity, results, in, complex, food, webs, with, large, predator, fish, eating, smaller, forage, fish, that, eat, yet, smaller, zooplankton, and, so, on, however, all, food, webs, eventually, depend, on, plants, which, are, the, primary, producers, coral, reefs, typically, produce, 5, 10, grams, of, carbon, per, square, meter, per, day, gc, m, 2, day, 1, biomass, one, reason, for, the, unusual, clarity, of, tropical, waters, is, their, nutrient, deficiency, and, drifting, plankton, further, the, sun, shines, year, round, in, the, tropics, warming, the, surface, layer, making, it, less, dense, than, subsurface, layers, the, warmer, water, is, separated, from, deeper, cooler, water, by, a, stable, thermocline, where, the, temperature, makes, a, rapid, change, this, keeps, the, warm, surface, waters, floating, above, the, cooler, deeper, waters, in, most, parts, of, the, ocean, there, is, little, exchange, between, these, layers, organisms, that, die, in, aquatic, environments, generally, sink, to, the, bottom, where, they, decompose, which, releases, nutrients, in, the, form, of, nitrogen, n, phosphorus, p, and, potassium, k, these, nutrients, are, necessary, for, plant, growth, but, in, the, tropics, they, do, not, directly, return, to, the, surface, plants, form, the, base, of, the, food, chain, and, need, sunlight, and, nutrients, to, grow, in, the, ocean, these, plants, are, mainly, microscopic, phytoplankton, which, drift, in, the, water, column, they, need, sunlight, for, photosynthesis, which, powers, carbon, fixation, so, they, are, found, only, relatively, near, the, surface, but, they, also, need, nutrients, phytoplankton, rapidly, use, nutrients, in, the, surface, waters, and, in, the, tropics, these, nutrients, are, not, usually, replaced, because, of, the, thermocline, around, coral, reefs, lagoons, fill, in, with, material, eroded, from, the, reef, and, the, island, they, become, havens, for, marine, life, providing, protection, from, waves, and, storms, most, importantly, reefs, recycle, nutrients, which, happens, much, less, in, the, open, ocean, in, coral, reefs, and, lagoons, producers, include, phytoplankton, as, well, as, seaweed, and, coralline, algae, especially, small, types, called, turf, algae, which, pass, nutrients, to, corals, the, phytoplankton, form, the, base, of, the, food, chain, and, are, eaten, by, fish, and, crustaceans, recycling, reduces, the, nutrient, inputs, needed, overall, to, support, the, community, corals, also, absorb, nutrients, including, inorganic, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, directly, from, water, many, corals, extend, their, tentacles, at, night, to, catch, zooplankton, that, pass, near, zooplankton, provide, the, polyp, with, nitrogen, and, the, polyp, shares, some, of, the, nitrogen, with, the, zooxanthellae, which, also, require, this, element, sponges, live, in, crevices, in, the, reefs, they, are, efficient, filter, feeders, and, in, the, red, sea, they, consume, about, 60, of, the, phytoplankton, that, drifts, by, sponges, eventually, excrete, nutrients, in, a, form, that, corals, can, use, the, roughness, of, coral, surfaces, is, key, to, coral, survival, in, agitated, waters, normally, a, boundary, layer, of, still, water, surrounds, a, submerged, object, which, acts, as, a, barrier, waves, breaking, on, the, extremely, rough, edges, of, corals, disrupt, the, boundary, layer, allowing, the, corals, access, to, passing, nutrients, turbulent, water, thereby, promotes, reef, growth, without, the, access, to, nutrients, brought, by, rough, coral, surfaces, even, the, most, effective, recycling, would, not, suffice, deep, nutrient, rich, water, entering, coral, reefs, through, isolated, events, may, have, significant, effects, on, temperature, and, nutrient, systems, this, water, movement, disrupts, the, relatively, stable, thermocline, that, usually, exists, between, warm, shallow, water, and, deeper, colder, water, temperature, regimes, on, coral, reefs, in, the, bahamas, and, florida, are, highly, variable, with, temporal, scales, of, minutes, to, seasons, and, spatial, scales, across, depths, water, can, pass, through, coral, reefs, in, various, ways, including, current, rings, surface, waves, internal, waves, and, tidal, changes, movement, is, generally, created, by, tides, and, wind, as, tides, interact, with, varying, bathymetry, and, wind, mixes, with, surface, water, internal, waves, are, created, an, internal, wave, is, a, gravity, wave, that, moves, along, density, stratification, within, the, ocean, when, a, water, parcel, encounters, a, different, density, it, oscillates, and, creates, internal, waves, while, internal, waves, generally, have, a, lower, frequency, than, surface, waves, they, often, form, as, a, single, wave, that, breaks, into, multiple, waves, as, it, hits, a, slope, and, moves, upward, this, vertical, breakup, of, internal, waves, causes, significant, diapycnal, mixing, and, turbulence, internal, waves, can, act, as, nutrient, pumps, bringing, plankton, and, cool, nutrient, rich, water, to, the, surface, the, irregular, structure, characteristic, of, coral, reef, bathymetry, may, enhance, mixing, and, produce, pockets, of, cooler, water, and, variable, nutrient, content, arrival, of, cool, nutrient, rich, water, from, depths, due, to, internal, waves, and, tidal, bores, has, been, linked, to, growth, rates, of, suspension, feeders, and, benthic, algae, as, well, as, plankton, and, larval, organisms, the, seaweed, codium, isthmocladum, reacts, to, deep, water, nutrient, sources, because, their, tissues, have, different, concentrations, of, nutrients, dependent, upon, depth, aggregations, of, eggs, larval, organisms, and, plankton, on, reefs, respond, to, deep, water, intrusions, similarly, as, internal, waves, and, bores, move, vertically, surface, dwelling, larval, organisms, are, carried, toward, the, shore, this, has, significant, biological, importance, to, cascading, effects, of, food, chains, in, coral, reef, ecosystems, and, may, provide, yet, another, key, to, unlocking, the, paradox, cyanobacteria, provide, soluble, nitrates, via, nitrogen, fixation, coral, reefs, often, depend, on, surrounding, habitats, such, as, seagrass, meadows, and, mangrove, forests, for, nutrients, seagrass, and, mangroves, supply, dead, plants, and, animals, that, are, rich, in, nitrogen, and, serve, to, feed, fish, and, animals, from, the, reef, by, supplying, wood, and, vegetation, reefs, in, turn, protect, mangroves, and, seagrass, from, waves, and, produce, sediment, in, which, the, mangroves, and, seagrass, can, root, coral, reefs, form, some, of, the, world, s, most, productive, ecosystems, providing, complex, and, varied, marine, habitats, that, support, a, wide, range, of, organisms, fringing, reefs, just, below, low, tide, level, have, a, mutually, beneficial, relationship, with, mangrove, forests, at, high, tide, level, and, sea, grass, meadows, in, between, the, reefs, protect, the, mangroves, and, seagrass, from, strong, currents, and, waves, that, would, damage, them, or, erode, the, sediments, in, which, they, are, rooted, while, the, mangroves, and, sea, grass, protect, the, coral, from, large, influxes, of, silt, fresh, water, and, pollutants, this, level, of, variety, in, the, environment, benefits, many, coral, reef, animals, which, for, example, may, feed, in, the, sea, grass, and, use, the, reefs, for, protection, or, breeding, reefs, are, home, to, a, variety, of, animals, including, fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians, which, includes, some, types, of, corals, and, jellyfish, worms, crustaceans, including, shrimp, cleaner, shrimp, spiny, lobsters, and, crabs, mollusks, including, cephalopods, echinoderms, including, starfish, sea, urchins, and, sea, cucumbers, sea, squirts, sea, turtles, and, sea, snakes, aside, from, humans, mammals, are, rare, on, coral, reefs, with, visiting, cetaceans, such, as, dolphins, the, main, exception, a, few, species, feed, directly, on, corals, while, others, graze, on, algae, on, the, reef, reef, biomass, is, positively, related, to, species, diversity, the, same, hideouts, in, a, reef, may, be, regularly, inhabited, by, different, species, at, different, times, of, day, nighttime, predators, such, as, cardinalfish, and, squirrelfish, hide, during, the, day, while, damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses, and, parrotfish, hide, from, eels, and, sharks, 49, the, great, number, and, diversity, of, hiding, places, in, coral, reefs, i, e, refuges, are, the, most, important, factor, causing, the, great, diversity, and, high, biomass, of, the, organisms, in, coral, reefs, coral, reefs, also, have, a, very, high, degree, of, microorganism, diversity, compared, to, other, environments, reefs, are, chronically, at, risk, of, algal, encroachment, overfishing, and, excess, nutrient, supply, from, onshore, can, enable, algae, to, outcompete, and, kill, the, coral, increased, nutrient, levels, can, be, a, result, of, sewage, or, chemical, fertilizer, runoff, runoff, can, carry, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, which, promote, excess, algae, growth, algae, can, sometimes, out, compete, the, coral, for, space, the, algae, can, then, smother, the, coral, by, decreasing, the, oxygen, supply, available, to, the, reef, decreased, oxygen, levels, can, slow, down,

population, consists, of, turf, algae, coralline, algae, and, macro, algae, some, sea, urchins, such, as, diadema, antillarum, eat, these, algae, and, could, thus, decrease, the, risk, of, algal, encroachment, sponges, are, essential, for, the, functioning, of, the, coral, reef, system, algae, and, corals, in, coral, reefs, produce, organic, material, this, is, filtered, through, sponges, which, convert, this, organic, material, into, small, particles, which, in, turn, are, absorbed, by, algae, and, corals, sponges, are, essential, to, the, coral, reef, system, however, they, are, quite, different, from, corals, while, corals, are, complex, and, many, celled, while, sponges, are, very, simple, organisms, with, no, tissue, they, are, alike, in, that, they, are, both, immobile, aquatic, invertebrates, but, otherwise, are, completely, different, types, of, sponges, there, are, several, different, species, of, sea, sponge, they, come, in, multiple, shapes, and, sizes, and, all, have, unique, characteristics, some, types, of, sea, sponges, include, the, tube, sponge, vase, sponge, yellow, sponge, bright, red, tree, sponge, painted, tunicate, sponge, and, the, sea, squirt, sponge, medicinal, qualities, of, sea, sponges, sea, sponges, have, provided, the, base, for, many, life, saving, medications, scientists, began, to, study, them, in, the, 1940s, and, after, a, few, years, discovered, that, sea, sponges, contain, properties, that, can, stop, viral, infections, the, first, drug, developed, from, sea, sponges, was, released, in, 1969, over, 4, 000, species, of, fish, inhabit, coral, reefs, the, reasons, for, this, diversity, remain, unclear, hypotheses, include, the, lottery, in, which, the, first, lucky, winner, recruit, to, a, territory, is, typically, able, to, defend, it, against, latecomers, competition, in, which, adults, compete, for, territory, and, less, competitive, species, must, be, able, to, survive, in, poorer, habitat, and, predation, in, which, population, size, is, a, function, of, postsettlement, piscivore, mortality, healthy, reefs, can, produce, up, to, 35, tons, of, fish, per, square, kilometre, each, year, but, damaged, reefs, produce, much, less, sea, urchins, dotidae, and, sea, slugs, eat, seaweed, some, species, of, sea, urchins, such, as, diadema, antillarum, can, play, a, pivotal, part, in, preventing, algae, from, overrunning, reefs, researchers, are, investigating, the, use, of, native, collector, urchins, tripneustes, gratilla, for, their, potential, as, biocontrol, agents, to, mitigate, the, spread,

during, the, end, permian, extinction, and, that, genera, with, poorly, buffered, respiratory, physiology, and, calcareous, shells, such, as, corals, were, particularly, vulnerable, corals, respond, to, stress, by, bleaching, or, expelling, their, colorful, zooxanthellate, endosymbionts, corals, with, clade, c, zooxanthellae, are, generally, vulnerable, to, heat, induced, bleaching, whereas, corals, with, the, hardier, clade, a, or, d, are, generally, resistant, as, are, tougher, coral, genera, like, porites, and, montipora, every, 4, 7, years, an, el, ni, o, event, causes, some, reefs, with, heat, sensitive, corals, to, bleach, with, especially, widespread, bleachings, in, 1998, and, 2010, however, reefs, that, experience, a, severe, bleaching, event, become, resistant, to, future, heat, induced, bleaching, due, to, rapid, directional, selection, similar, rapid, adaption, may, protect, coral, reefs, from, global, warming, a, large, scale, systematic, study, of, the, jarvis, island, coral, community, which, experienced, ten, el, ni, o, coincident, coral, bleaching, events, from, 1960, to, 2016, found, that, the, reef, recovered, from, almost, complete, death, after, severe, events, marine, protected, areas, mpas, are, areas, designated, because, they, provide, various, kinds, of, protection, to, ocean, and, or, estuarine, areas, they, are, intended, to, promote, responsible, fishery, management, and, habitat, protection, mpas, can, also, encompass, social, and, biological, objectives, including, reef, restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity, and, economic, benefits, the, effectiveness, of, mpas, is, still, debated, for, example, a, study, investigating, the, success, of, a, small, number, of, mpas, in, indonesia, the, philippines, and, papua, new, guinea, found, no, significant, differences, between, the, mpas, and, unprotected, sites, furthermore, in, some, cases, they, can, generate, local, conflict, due, to, a, lack, of, community, participation, clashing, views, of, the, government, and, fisheries, effectiveness, of, the, area, and, funding, in, some, situations, as, in, the, phoenix, islands, protected, area, mpas, provide, revenue, to, locals, the, level, of, income, provided, is, similar, to, the, income, they, would, have, generated, without, controls, overall, it, appears, the, mpa, s, can, provide, protection, to, local, coral, reefs, but, that, clear, management, and, sufficient, funds, are, required, the, caribbean, coral, reefs, status, report, 1970, 2012, states, that, coral, decline, may, be, reduced, or, even, reversed, for, this, overfishing, needs, to, be, stopped, especially, fishing, on, species, key, to, coral, reefs, such, as, parrotfish, direct, human, pressure, on, coral, reefs, should, also, be, reduced, and, the, inflow, of, sewage, should, be, minimised, measures, to, achieve, this, could, include, restricting, coastal, settlement, development, and, tourism, the, report, shows, that, healthier, reefs, in, the, caribbean, are, those, with, large, healthy, populations, of, parrotfish, these, occur, in, countries, that, protect, parrotfish, and, other, species, like, sea, urchins, they, also, often, ban, fish, trapping, and, spearfishing, together, these, measures, help, creating, resilient, reefs, protecting, networks, of, diverse, and, healthy, reefs, not, only, climate, refugia, helps, ensure, the, greatest, chance, of, genetic, diversity, which, is, critical, for, coral, to, adapt, to, new, climates, a, variety, of, conservation, methods, applied, across, marine, and, terrestrial, threatened, ecosystems, makes, coral, adaption, more, likely, and, effective, designating, a, reef, as, a, biosphere, reserve, marine, park, national, monument, or, world, heritage, site, can, offer, protections, for, example, belize, s, barrier, reef, sian, ka, an, the, galapagos, islands, great, barrier, reef, henderson, island, palau, and, papah, naumoku, kea, marine, national, monument, are, world, heritage, sites, in, australia, the, great, barrier, reef, is, protected, by, the, great, barrier, reef, marine, park, authority, and, is, the, subject, of, much, legislation, including, a, biodiversity, action, plan, australia, compiled, a, coral, reef, resilience, action, plan, this, plan, consists, of, adaptive, management, strategies, including, reducing, carbon, footprint, a, public, awareness, plan, provides, education, on, the, rainforests, of, the, sea, and, how, people, can, reduce, carbon, emissions, inhabitants, of, ahus, island, manus, province, papua, new, guinea, have, followed, a, generations, old, practice, of, restricting, fishing, in, six, areas, of, their, reef, lagoon, their, cultural, traditions, allow, line, fishing, but, no, net, or, spear, fishing, both, biomass, and, individual, fish, sizes, are, significantly, larger, than, in, places, where, fishing, is, unrestricted, increased, levels, of, atmospheric, co, 2, contribute, to, ocean, acidification, which, in, turn, damages, coral, reefs, to, help, combat, ocean, acidification, several, countries, have, put, laws, in, place, to, reduce, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, many, land, use, laws, aim, to, reduce, co, 2, emissions, by, limiting, deforestation, deforestation, can, release, significant, amounts, of, co, 2, absent, sequestration, via, active, follow, up, forestry, programs, deforestation, can, also, cause, erosion, which, flows, into, the, ocean, contributing, to, ocean, acidification, incentives, are, used, to, reduce, miles, traveled, by, vehicles, which, reduces, carbon, emissions, into, the, atmosphere, thereby, reducing, the, amount, of, dissolved, co, 2, in, the, ocean, state, and, federal, governments, also, regulate, land, activities, that, affect, coastal, erosion, high, end, satellite, technology, can, monitor, reef, conditions, the, united, states, clean, water, act, puts, pressure, on, state, governments, to, monitor, and, limit, run, off, of, polluted, water, coral, reef, restoration, has, grown, in, prominence, over, the, past, several, decades, because, of, the, unprecedented, reef, die, offs, around, the, planet, coral, stressors, can, include, pollution, warming, ocean, temperatures, extreme, weather, events, and, overfishing, with, the, deterioration, of, global, reefs, fish, nurseries, biodiversity, coastal, development, and, livelihood, and, natural, beauty, are, under, threat, fortunately, researchers, have, taken, it, upon, themselves, to, develop, a, new, field, coral, restoration, in, the, 1970s, 1980s, coral, aquaculture, also, known, as, coral, farming, or, coral, gardening, is, showing, promise, as, a, potentially, effective, tool, for, restoring, coral, reefs, the, gardening, process, bypasses, the, early, growth, stages, of, corals, when, they, are, most, at, risk, of, dying, coral, seeds, are, grown, in, nurseries, then, replanted, on, the, reef, coral, is, farmed, by, coral, farmers, whose, interests, range, from, reef, conservation, to, increased, income, due, to, its, straight, forward, process, and, substantial, evidence, of, the, technique, having, a, significant, effect, on, coral, reef, growth, coral, nurseries, became, the, most, widespread, and, arguably, the, most, effective, method, for, coral, restoration, coral, gardens, take, advantage, of, a, coral, s, natural, ability, to, fragment, and, continuing, to, grow, if, the, fragments, are, able, to, anchor, themselves, onto, new, substrates, this, method, was, first, tested, by, baruch, rinkevich, in, 1995, which, found, success, at, the, time, by, today, s, standards, coral, farming, has, grown, into, a, variety, of, different, forms, but, still, has, the, same, goals, of, cultivating, corals, consequently, coral, farming, quickly, replaced, previously, used, transplantation, methods, or, the, act, of, physically, moving, sections, or, whole, colonies, of, corals, into, a, new, area, transplantation, has, seen, success, in, the, past, and, decades, of, experiments, have, led, to, a, high, success, and, survival, rate, however, this, method, still, requires, the, removal, of, corals, from, existing, reefs, with, the, current, state, of, reefs, this, kind, of, method, should, generally, be, avoided, if, possible, saving, healthy, corals, from, eroding, substrates, or, reefs, that, are, doomed, to, collapse, could, be, a, major, advantage, of, utilizing, transplantation, coral, gardens, generally, take, on, the, safe, forms, no, matter, where, you, go, it, begins, with, the, establishment, of, a, nursery, where, operators, can, observe, and, care, for, coral, fragments, it, goes, without, saying, that, nurseries, should, be, established, in, areas, that, are, going, to, maximize, growth, and, minimize, mortality, floating, offshore, coral, trees, or, even, aquariums, are, possible, locations, where, corals, can, grow, after, a, location, has, been, determined, collection, and, cultivation, can, occur, the, major, benefit, of, using, coral, farms, is, it, lowers, polyp, and, juvenile, mortality, rates, by, removing, predators, and, recruitment, obstacles, corals, are, able, to, mature, without, much, hindrance, however, nurseries, cannot, stop, climate, stressors, warming, temperatures, or, hurricanes, can, still, disrupt, or, even, kill, nursery, corals, technology, is, becoming, more, popular, in, the, coral, farming, process, teams, from, the, reef, restoration, and, adaptation, program, rrap, have, trialled, coral, counting, technology, utilizing, a, prototype, robotic, camera, the, camera, uses, computer, vision, and, learning, algorithms, to, detect, and, count, individual, coral, babies, and, track, their, growth, and, health, in, real, time, this, technology, with, research, led, by, qut, is, intended, to, be, used, during, annual, coral, spawning, events, and, will, provide, researchers, with, control, that, is, not, currently, possible, when, mass, producing, corals, efforts, to, expand, the, size, and, number, of, coral, reefs, generally, involve, supplying, substrate, to, allow, more, corals, to, find, a, home, substrate, materials, include, discarded, vehicle, tires, scuttled, ships, subway, cars, and, formed, concrete, such, as, reef, balls, reefs, grow, unaided, on, marine, structures, such, as, oil, rigs, in, large, restoration, projects, propagated, hermatypic, coral, on, substrate, can, be, secured, with, metal, pins, superglue, or, milliput, needle, and, thread, can, also, attach, a, hermatype, coral, to, substrate, biorock, is, a, substrate, produced, by, a, patented, process, that, runs, low, voltage, electrical, currents, through, seawater, to, cause, dissolved, minerals, to, precipitate, onto, steel, structures, the, resultant, white, carbonate, aragonite, is, the, same, mineral, that, makes, up, natural, coral, reefs, corals, rapidly, colonize, and, grow, at, accelerated, rates, on, these, coated, structures, the, electrical, currents, also, accelerate, the, formation, and, growth, of, both, chemical, limestone, rock, and, the, skeletons, of, corals, and, other, shell, bearing, organisms, such, as, oysters, the, vicinity, of, the, anode, and, cathode, provides, a, high, ph, environment, which, inhibits, the, growth, of, competitive, filamentous, and, fleshy, algae, the, increased, growth, rates, fully, depend, on, the, accretion, activity, under, the, influence, of, the, electric, field, corals, display, an, increased, growth, rate, size, and, density, simply, having, many, structures, on, the, ocean, floor, is, not, enough, to, form, coral, reefs, restoration, projects, must, consider, the, complexity, of, the, substrates, they, are, creating, for, future, reefs, researchers, conducted, an, experiment, near, ticao, island, in, the, philippines, in, 2013, where, several, substrates, in, varying, complexities, were, laid, in, the, nearby, degraded, reefs, large, complexity, consisted, of, plots, that, had, both, a, human, made, substrates, of, both, smooth, and, rough, rocks, with, a, surrounding, fence, medium, consisted, of, only, the, human, made, substrates, and, small, had, neither, the, fence, or, substrates, after, one, month, researchers, found, that, there, was, a, positive, correlation, between, structure, complexity, and, recruitment, rates, of, larvae, the, medium, complexity, performed, the, best, with, larvae, favoring, rough, rocks, over, smooth, rocks, following, one, year, of, their, study, researchers, visited, the, site, and, found, that, many, of, the, sites, were, able, to, support, local, fisheries, they, came, to, the, conclusion, that, reef, restoration, could, be, done, cost, effectively, and, will, yield, long, term, benefits, given, they, are, protected, and, maintained, one, case, study, with, coral, reef, restoration, was, conducted, on, the, island, of, oahu, in, hawaii, the, university, of, hawaii, operates, a, coral, reef, assessment, and, monitoring, program, to, help, relocate, and, restore, coral, reefs, in, hawaii, a, boat, channel, from, the, island, of, oahu, to, the, hawaii, institute, of, marine, biology, on, coconut, island, was, overcrowded, with, coral, reefs, many, areas, of, coral, reef, patches, in, the, channel, had, been, damaged, from, past, dredging, in, the, channel, dredging, covers, corals, with, sand, coral, larvae, cannot, settle, on, sand, they, can, only, build, on, existing, reefs, or, compatible, hard, surfaces, such, as, rock, or, concrete, because, of, this, the, university, decided, to, relocate, some, of, the, coral, they, transplanted, them, with, the, help, of, united, states, army, divers, to, a, site, relatively, close, to, the, channel, they, observed, little, if, any, damage, to, any, of, the, colonies, during, transport, and, no, mortality, of, coral, reefs, was, observed, on, the, transplant, site, while, attaching, the, coral, to, the, transplant, site, they, found, that, coral, placed, on, hard, rock, grew, well, including, on, the, wires, that, attached, the, corals, to, the, site, no, environmental, effects, were, seen, from, the, transplantation, process, recreational, activities, were, not, decreased, and, no, scenic, areas, were, affected, as, an, alternative, to, transplanting, coral, themselves, juvenile, fish, can, also, be, encouraged, to, relocate, to, existing, coral, reefs, by, auditory, simulation, in, damaged, sections, of, the, great, barrier, reef, loudspeakers, playing, recordings, of, healthy, reef, environments, were, found, to, attract, fish, twice, as, often, as, equivalent, patches, where, no, sound, was, played, and, also, increased, species, biodiversity, by, 50, another, possibility, for, coral, restoration, is, gene, therapy, inoculating, coral, with, genetically, modified, bacteria, or, naturally, occurring, heat, tolerant, varieties, of, coral, symbiotes, may, make, it, possible, to, grow, corals, that, are, more, resistant, to, climate, change, and, other, threats, warming, oceans, are, forcing, corals, to, adapt, to, unprecedented, temperatures, those, that, do, not, have, a, tolerance, for, the, elevated, temperatures, experience, coral, bleaching, and, eventually, mortality, there, is, already, research, that, looks, to, create, genetically, modified, corals, that, can, withstand, a, warming, ocean, madeleine, j, h, van, oppen, james, k, oliver, hollie, m, putnam, and, ruth, d, gates, described, four, different, ways, that, gradually, increase, in, human, intervention, to, genetically, modify, corals, these, methods, focus, on, altering, the, genetics, of, the, zooxanthellae, within, coral, rather, than, the, alternative, the, first, method, is, to, induce, acclimatization, of, the, first, generation, of, corals, the, idea, is, that, when, adult, and, offspring, corals, are, exposed, to, stressors, the, zooxanthellae, will, gain, a, mutation, this, method, is, based, mostly, on, the, chance, that, the, zooxanthellae, will, acquire, the, specific, trait, that, will, allow, it, to, better, survive, in, warmer, waters, the, second, method, focuses, on, identifying, what, different, kinds, of, zooxanthellae, are, within, the, coral, and, configuring, how, much, of, each, zooxanthella, lives, within, the, coral, at, a, given, age, use, of, zooxanthellae, from, the, previous, method, would, only, boost, success, rates, for, this, method, however, this, method, would, only, be, applicable, to, younger, corals, for, now, because, previous, experiments, of, manipulation, zooxanthellae, communities, at, later, life, stages, have, all, failed, the, third, method, focuses, on, selective, breeding, tactics, once, selected, corals, would, be, reared, and, exposed, to, simulated, stressors, in, a, laboratory, the, last, method, is, to, genetically, modify, the, zooxanthellae, itself, when, preferred, mutations, are, acquired, the, genetically, modified, zooxanthellae, will, be, introduced, to, an, aposymbiotic, poly, and, a, new, coral, will, be, produced, this, method, is, the, most, laborious, of, the, fourth, but, researchers, believe, this, method, should, be, utilized, more, and, holds, the, most, promise, in, genetic, engineering, for, coral, restoration, hawaiian, coral, reefs, smothered, by, the, spread, of, invasive, algae, were, managed, with, a, two, prong, approach, divers, manually, removed, invasive, algae, with, the, support, of, super, sucker, barges, grazing, pressure, on, invasive, algae, needed, to, be, increased, to, prevent, the, regrowth, of, the, algae, researchers, found, that, native, collector, urchins, were, reasonable, candidate, grazers, for, algae, biocontrol, to, extirpate, the, remaining, invasive, algae, from, the, reef, macroalgae, or, better, known, as, seaweed, has, to, potential, to, cause, reef, collapse, because, they, can, outcompete, many, coral, species, macroalgae, can, overgrow, on, corals, shade, block, recruitment, release, biochemicals, that, can, hinder, spawning, and, potentially, form, bacteria, harmful, to, corals, historically, algae, growth, was, controlled, by, herbivorous, fish, and, sea, urchins, parrotfish, are, a, prime, example, of, reef, caretakers, consequently, these, two, species, can, be, considered, as, keystone, species, for, reef, environments, because, of, their, role, in, protecting, reefs, before, the, 1980s, jamaica, s, reefs, were, thriving, and, well, cared, for, however, this, all, changed, after, hurricane, allen, occurred, in, 1980, and, an, unknown, disease, spread, across, the, caribbean, in, the, wake, of, these, events, massive, damage, was, caused, to, both, the, reefs, and, sea, urchin, population, across, jamaican, s, reefs, and, into, the, caribbean, sea, as, little, as, 2, of, the, original, sea, urchin, population, survived, the, disease, primary, macroalgae, succeeded, the, destroyed, reefs, and, eventually, larger, more, resilient, macroalgae, soon, took, its, place, as, the, dominant, organism, parrotfish, and, other, herbivorous, fish, were, few, in, numbers, because, of, decades, of, overfishing, and, bycatch, at, the, time, historically, the, jamaican, coast, had, 90, coral, cover, and, was, reduced, to, 5, in, the, 1990s, eventually, corals, were, able, to, recover, in, areas, where, sea, urchin, populations, were, increasing, sea, urchins, were, able, to, feed, and, multiply, and, clear, off, substrates, leaving, areas, for, coral, polyps, to, anchor, and, mature, however, sea, urchin, populations, are, still, not, recovering, as, fast, as, researchers, predicted, despite, being, highly, fecundate, it, is, unknown, whether, or, not, the, mysterious, disease, is, still, present, and, preventing, sea, urchin, populations, from, rebounding, regardless, these, areas, are, slowly, recovering, with, the, aid, of, sea, urchin, grazing, this, event, supports, an, early, restoration, idea, of, cultivating, and, releasing, sea, urchins, into, reefs, to, prevent, algal, overgrowth, 014, christopher, page, erinn, muller, and, david, vaughan, from, the, international, center, for, coral, reef, research, restoration, at, mote, marine, laboratory, in, summerland, key, florida, developed, a, new, technology, called, microfragmentation, in, which, they, use, a, specialized, diamond, band, saw, to, cut, corals, into, 1, cm, 2, fragments, instead, of, 6, cm, 2, to, advance, the, growth, of, brain, boulder, and, star, corals, corals, orbicella, faveolata, and, montastraea, cavernosa, were, outplanted, off, the, florida, s, shores, in, several, microfragment, arrays, after, two, years, o, faveolata, had, grown, 6, 5x, its, original, size, while, m, cavernosa, had, grown, nearly, twice, its, size, under, conventional, means, both, corals, would, have, required, decades, to, reach, the, same, size, it, is, suspected, that, if, predation, events, had, not, occurred, near, the, beginning, of, the, experiment, o, faveolata, would, have, grown, at, least, ten, times, its, original, size, by, using, this, method, mote, marine, laboratory, successfully, generated, 25, 000, corals, within, a, single, year, subsequently, transplanting, 10, 000, of, them, into, the, florida, keys, shortly, after, they, discovered, that, these, microfragments, fused, with, other, microfragments, from, the, same, parent, coral, typically, corals, that, are, not, from, the, same, parent, fight, and, kill, nearby, corals, in, an, attempt, to, survive, and, expand, this, new, technology, is, known, as, fusion, and, has, been, shown, to, grow, coral, heads, in, just, two, years, instead, of, the, typical, 25, 75, years, after, fusion, occurs, the, reef, will, act, as, a, single, organism, rather, than, several, independent, reefs, currently, there, has, been, no, published, research, into, this, method
