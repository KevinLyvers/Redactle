an, elliptical, galaxy, is, a, type, of, galaxy, with, an, approximately, ellipsoidal, shape, and, a, smooth, nearly, featureless, image, they, are, one, of, the, four, main, classes, of, galaxy, described, by, edwin, hubble, in, his, hubble, sequence, and, 1936, work, the, realm, of, the, nebulae, along, with, spiral, and, lenticular, galaxies, elliptical, e, galaxies, are, together, with, lenticular, galaxies, s0, with, their, large, scale, disks, and, es, galaxies, with, their, intermediate, scale, disks, a, subset, of, the, early, type, galaxy, population, most, elliptical, galaxies, are, composed, of, older, low, mass, stars, with, a, sparse, interstellar, medium, and, they, tend, to, be, surrounded, by, large, numbers, of, globular, clusters, star, formation, activity, in, elliptical, galaxies, is, typically, minimal, they, may, however, undergo, brief, periods, of, star, formation, when, merging, with, other, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, are, believed, to, make, up, approximately, 10, 15, of, galaxies, in, the, virgo, supercluster, and, they, are, not, the, dominant, type, of, galaxy, in, the, universe, overall, they, are, preferentially, found, close, to, the, centers, of, galaxy, clusters, elliptical, galaxies, range, in, size, from, dwarf, ellipticals, with, tens, of, millions, of, stars, to, supergiants, of, over, one, hundred, trillion, stars, that, dominate, their, galaxy, clusters, originally, edwin, hubble, hypothesized, that, elliptical, galaxies, evolved, into, spiral, galaxies, which, was, later, discovered, to, be, false, although, the, accretion, of, gas, and, smaller, galaxies, may, build, a, disk, around, a, pre, existing, ellipsoidal, structure, stars, found, inside, of, elliptical, galaxies, are, on, average, much, older, than, stars, found, in, spiral, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, are, characterized, by, several, properties, that, make, them, distinct, from, other, classes, of, galaxy, they, are, spherical, or, ovoid, masses, of, stars, starved, of, star, making, gases, furthermore, there, is, very, little, interstellar, matter, neither, gas, nor, dust, which, results, in, low, rates, of, star, formation, few, open, star, clusters, and, few, young, stars, rather, elliptical, galaxies, are, dominated, by, old, stellar, populations, giving, them, red, colors, large, elliptical, galaxies, typically, have, an, extensive, system, of, globular, clusters, they, generally, have, two, distinct, populations, of, globular, clusters, one, that, is, redder, and, metal, rich, and, another, that, is, bluer, and, metal, poor, the, dynamical, properties, of, elliptical, galaxies, and, the, bulges, of, disk, galaxies, are, similar, suggesting, that, they, may, be, formed, by, the, same, physical, processes, although, this, remains, controversial, the, luminosity, profiles, of, both, elliptical, galaxies, and, bulges, are, well, fit, by, sersic, s, law, and, a, range, of, scaling, relations, between, the, elliptical, galaxies, structural, parameters, unify, the, population, every, massive, elliptical, galaxy, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, center, observations, of, 46, elliptical, galaxies, 20, classical, bulges, and, 22, pseudobulges, show, that, each, contain, a, black, hole, at, the, center, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, is, tightly, correlated, with, the, mass, of, the, galaxy, evidenced, through, correlations, such, as, the, m, sigma, relation, which, relates, the, velocity, dispersion, of, the, surrounding, stars, to, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, at, the, center, elliptical, galaxies, are, preferentially, found, in, galaxy, clusters, and, in, compact, groups, of, galaxies, unlike, flat, spiral, galaxies, with, organization, and, structure, elliptical, galaxies, are, more, three, dimensional, without, much, structure, and, their, stars, are, in, somewhat, random, orbits, around, the, center, the, largest, galaxies, are, supergiant, ellipticals, or, type, cd, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, vary, greatly, in, both, size, and, mass, with, diameters, ranging, from, 3, 000, light, years, to, more, than, 700, 000, light, years, and, masses, from, 10, 5, to, nearly, 10, 13, solar, masses, this, range, is, much, broader, for, this, galaxy, type, than, for, any, other, the, smallest, the, dwarf, elliptical, galaxies, may, be, no, larger, than, a, typical, globular, cluster, but, contain, a, considerable, amount, of, dark, matter, not, present, in, clusters, most, of, these, small, galaxies, may, not, be, related, to, other, ellipticals, the, hubble, classification, of, elliptical, galaxies, contains, an, integer, that, describes, how, elongated, the, galaxy, image, is, the, classification, is, determined, by, the, ratio, of, the, major, a, to, the, minor, b, axes, of, the, galaxy, s, isophotes, thus, for, a, spherical, galaxy, with, a, equal, to, b, the, number, is, 0, and, the, hubble, type, is, e0, while, the, limit, in, the, literature, is, about, e7, it, has, been, known, since, 1966, that, the, e4, to, e7, galaxies, are, misclassified, lenticular, galaxies, with, disks, inclined, at, different, angles, to, our, line, of, sight, this, has, been, confirmed, through, spectral, observations, revealing, the, rotation, of, their, stellar, disks, hubble, recognized, that, his, shape, classification, depends, both, on, the, intrinsic, shape, of, the, galaxy, as, well, as, the, angle, with, which, the, galaxy, is, observed, hence, some, galaxies, with, hubble, type, e0, are, actually, elongated, it, is, sometimes, said, that, there, are, two, physical, types, of, ellipticals, the, giant, ellipticals, with, slightly, boxy, shaped, isophotes, whose, shapes, result, from, random, motion, which, is, greater, in, some, directions, than, in, others, anisotropic, random, motion, and, the, disky, normal, and, dwarf, ellipticals, which, contain, disks, this, is, however, an, abuse, of, the, nomenclature, as, there, are, two, types, of, early, type, galaxy, those, with, disks, and, those, without, given, the, existence, of, es, galaxies, with, intermediate, scale, disks, it, is, reasonable, to, expect, that, there, is, a, continuity, from, e, to, es, and, onto, the, s0, galaxies, with, their, large, scale, stellar, disks, that, dominate, the, light, at, large, radii, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, appear, to, be, a, distinct, class, their, properties, are, more, similar, to, those, of, irregulars, and, late, spiral, type, galaxies, at, the, large, end, of, the, elliptical, spectrum, there, is, further, division, beyond, hubble, s, classification, beyond, ge, giant, ellipticals, lies, d, galaxies, and, cd, galaxies, these, are, similar, to, their, smaller, brethren, but, more, diffuse, with, large, haloes, that, may, as, much, belong, to, the, galaxy, cluster, within, which, they, reside, than, the, centrally, located, giant, galaxy, in, recent, years, evidence, has, shown, that, a, reasonable, proportion, 25, of, early, type, e, es, and, s0, galaxies, have, residual, gas, reservoirs, and, low, level, star, formation, herschel, space, observatory, researchers, have, speculated, that, the, central, black, holes, in, elliptical, galaxies, keep, the, gas, from, cooling, enough, for, star, formation
