scandium, is, a, chemical, element, with, the, symbol, sc, and, atomic, number, 21, it, is, a, silvery, white, metallic, d, block, element, historically, it, has, been, classified, as, a, rare, earth, element, together, with, yttrium, and, the, lanthanides, it, was, discovered, in, 1879, by, spectral, analysis, of, the, minerals, euxenite, and, gadolinite, from, scandinavia, scandium, is, present, in, most, of, the, deposits, of, rare, earth, and, uranium, compounds, but, it, is, extracted, from, these, ores, in, only, a, few, mines, worldwide, because, of, the, low, availability, and, difficulties, in, the, preparation, of, metallic, scandium, which, was, first, done, in, 1937, applications, for, scandium, were, not, developed, until, the, 1970s, when, the, positive, effects, of, scandium, on, aluminium, alloys, were, discovered, its, use, in, such, alloys, remains, its, only, major, application, the, global, trade, of, scandium, oxide, is, 15, 20, tonnes, per, year, the, properties, of, scandium, compounds, are, intermediate, between, those, of, aluminium, and, yttrium, a, diagonal, relationship, exists, between, the, behavior, of, magnesium, and, scandium, just, as, there, is, between, beryllium, and, aluminium, in, the, chemical, compounds, of, the, elements, in, group, 3, the, predominant, oxidation, state, is, 3, scandium, is, a, soft, metal, with, a, silvery, appearance, it, develops, a, slightly, yellowish, or, pinkish, cast, when, oxidized, by, air, it, is, susceptible, to, weathering, and, dissolves, slowly, in, most, dilute, acids, it, does, not, react, with, a, 1, 1, mixture, of, nitric, acid, hno, 3, and, 48, 0, hydrofluoric, acid, hf, possibly, due, to, the, formation, of, an, impermeable, passive, layer, scandium, turnings, ignite, in, the, air, with, a, brilliant, yellow, flame, to, form, scandium, oxide, in, nature, scandium, is, found, exclusively, as, the, isotope, 45, sc, which, has, a, nuclear, spin, of, 7, 2, this, is, its, only, stable, isotope, twenty, five, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, the, most, stable, being, 46, sc, which, has, a, half, life, of, 83, 8, days, 47, sc, 3, 35, days, the, positron, emitter, 44, sc, 4, hours, and, 48, sc, 43, 7, hours, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, less, than, 4, hours, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, less, than, 2, minutes, this, element, also, has, five, nuclear, isomers, with, the, most, stable, being, 44m2, sc, t, 1, 2, 58, 6, h, the, known, isotopes, of, scandium, range, from, 36, sc, to, 60, sc, the, primary, decay, mode, at, masses, lower, than, the, only, stable, isotope, 45, sc, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, at, masses, above, it, is, beta, emission, the, primary, decay, products, at, atomic, weights, below, 45, sc, are, calcium, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, from, higher, atomic, weights, are, titanium, isotopes, in, earth, s, crust, scandium, is, not, rare, estimates, vary, from, 18, to, 25, ppm, which, is, comparable, to, the, abundance, of, cobalt, 20, 30, ppm, scandium, is, only, the, 50th, most, common, element, on, earth, 35th, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, but, it, is, the, 23rd, most, common, element, in, the, sun, and, the, 26th, most, abundant, element, in, the, stars, however, scandium, is, distributed, sparsely, and, occurs, in, trace, amounts, in, many, minerals, rare, minerals, from, scandinavia, and, madagascar, such, as, thortveitite, euxenite, and, gadolinite, are, the, only, known, concentrated, sources, of, this, element, thortveitite, can, contain, up, to, 45, of, scandium, in, the, form, of, scandium, oxide, the, stable, form, of, scandium, is, created, in, supernovas, via, the, r, process, also, scandium, is, created, by, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, the, more, abundant, iron, nuclei, the, world, production, of, scandium, is, in, the, order, of, 15, 20, tonnes, per, year, in, the, form, of, scandium, oxide, the, demand, is, slightly, higher, and, both, the, production, and, demand, keep, increasing, in, 2003, only, three, mines, produced, scandium, the, uranium, and, iron, mines, in, zhovti, vody, in, ukraine, the, rare, earth, mines, in, bayan, obo, china, and, the, apatite, mines, in, the, kola, peninsula, russia, since, then, many, other, countries, have, built, scandium, producing, facilities, including, 5, tonnes, year, 7, 5, tonnes, year, sc, 2, o, 3, by, nickel, asia, corporation, and, sumitomo, metal, mining, in, the, philippines, in, the, united, states, niocorp, development, hopes, to, raise, 1, billion, toward, opening, a, niobium, mine, at, its, elk, creek, site, in, southeast, nebraska, which, may, be, able, to, produce, as, much, as, 95, tonnes, of, scandium, oxide, annually, in, each, case, scandium, is, a, byproduct, of, the, extraction, of, other, elements, and, is, sold, as, scandium, oxide, to, produce, metallic, scandium, the, oxide, is, converted, to, scandium, fluoride, and, then, reduced, with, metallic, calcium, madagascar, and, the, iveland, evje, region, in, norway, have, the, only, deposits, of, minerals, with, high, scandium, content, thortveitite, sc, y, 2, si, 2, o, 7, but, these, are, not, being, exploited, the, mineral, kolbeckite, scpo, 4, 2h, 2, o, has, a, very, high, scandium, content, but, is, not, available, in, any, larger, deposits, the, absence, of, reliable, secure, stable, long, term, production, has, limited, the, commercial, applications, of, scandium, despite, this, low, level, of, use, scandium, offers, significant, benefits, particularly, promising, is, the, strengthening, of, aluminium, alloys, with, as, little, as, 0, 5, scandium, scandium, stabilized, zirconia, enjoys, a, growing, market, demand, for, use, as, a, high, efficiency, electrolyte, in, solid, oxide, fuel, cells, the, usgs, reports, that, from, 2015, to, 2019, in, the, us, the, price, of, small, quantities, of, scandium, ingot, has, been, 107, to, 134, per, gram, and, that, of, scandium, oxide, 4, to, 5, per, gram, scandium, chemistry, is, almost, completely, dominated, by, the, trivalent, ion, sc, 3, the, radii, of, m, 3, ions, in, the, table, below, indicate, that, the, chemical, properties, of, scandium, ions, have, more, in, common, with, yttrium, ions, than, with, aluminium, ions, in, part, because, of, this, similarity, scandium, is, often, classified, as, a, lanthanide, like, element, the, oxide, sc, 2, o, 3, and, the, hydroxide, sc, oh, 3, are, amphoteric, and, scooh, are, isostructural, with, their, aluminium, hydroxide, oxide, counterparts, solutions, of, sc, 3, in, water, are, acidic, due, to, hydrolysis, the, halides, scx, 3, where, x, cl, br, or, i, are, very, soluble, in, water, but, scf, 3, is, insoluble, in, all, four, halides, the, scandium, is, 6, coordinated, the, halides, are, lewis, acids, for, example, scf, 3, dissolves, in, a, solution, containing, excess, fluoride, ion, to, form, 3, the, coordination, number, 6, is, typical, for, sc, iii, in, the, larger, y, 3, and, la, 3, ions, coordination, numbers, of, 8, and, 9, are, common, scandium, triflate, is, sometimes, used, as, a, lewis, acid, catalyst, in, organic, chemistry, scandium, forms, a, series, of, organometallic, compounds, with, cyclopentadienyl, ligands, cp, similar, to, the, behavior, of, the, lanthanides, one, example, is, the, chlorine, bridged, dimer, 2, and, related, derivatives, of, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, ligands, compounds, that, feature, scandium, in, oxidation, states, other, than, 3, are, rare, but, well, characterized, the, blue, black, compound, cssccl, 3, is, one, of, the, simplest, this, material, adopts, a, sheet, like, structure, that, exhibits, extensive, bonding, between, the, scandium, ii, centers, scandium, hydride, is, not, well, understood, although, it, appears, not, to, be, a, saline, hydride, of, sc, ii, as, is, observed, for, most, elements, a, diatomic, scandium, hydride, has, been, observed, spectroscopically, at, high, temperatures, in, the, gas, phase, scandium, borides, and, carbides, are, non, stoichiometric, as, is, typical, for, neighboring, elements, lower, oxidation, states, 2, 1, 0, have, also, been, observed, in, organoscandium, compounds, dmitri, mendeleev, who, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, the, periodic, table, predicted, the, existence, of, an, element, ekaboron, with, an, atomic, mass, between, 40, and, 48, in, 1869, lars, fredrik, nilson, and, his, team, detected, this, element, in, the, minerals, euxenite, and, gadolinite, in, 1879, nilson, prepared, 2, grams, of, scandium, oxide, of, high, purity, he, named, the, element, scandium, from, the, latin, scandia, meaning, scandinavia, nilson, was, apparently, unaware, of, mendeleev, s, prediction, but, per, teodor, cleve, recognized, the, correspondence, and, notified, mendeleev, metallic, scandium, was, produced, for, the, first, time, in, 1937, by, electrolysis, of, a, eutectic, mixture, of, potassium, lithium, and, scandium, chlorides, at, 700, 800, c, the, first, pound, of, 99, pure, scandium, metal, was, produced, in, 1960, production, of, aluminium, alloys, began, in, 1971, following, a, us, patent, aluminium, scandium, alloys, were, also, developed, in, the, ussr, laser, crystals, of, gadolinium, scandium, gallium, garnet, gsgg, were, used, in, strategic, defense, applications, developed, for, the, strategic, defense, initiative, sdi, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, main, application, of, scandium, by, weight, is, in, aluminium, scandium, alloys, for, minor, aerospace, industry, components, these, alloys, contain, between, 0, 1, and, 0, 5, of, scandium, they, were, used, in, russian, military, aircraft, specifically, the, mikoyan, gurevich, mig, 21, and, mig, 29, the, addition, of, scandium, to, aluminium, limits, the, grain, growth, in, the, heat, zone, of, welded, aluminium, components, this, has, two, beneficial, effects, the, precipitated, al, 3, sc, forms, smaller, crystals, than, in, other, aluminium, alloys, and, the, volume, of, precipitate, free, zones, at, the, grain, boundaries, of, age, hardening, aluminium, alloys, is, reduced, the, al, 3, sc, precipitate, is, a, coherent, precipitate, that, strengthens, the, aluminum, matrix, by, applying, elastic, strain, fields, that, inhibit, dislocation, movement, i, e, plastic, deformation, al, 3, sc, has, an, equilibrium, l1, 2, superlattice, structure, exclusive, to, this, system, a, fine, dispersion, of, nano, scale, precipitate, can, be, achieved, via, heat, treatment, that, can, also, strengthen, the, alloys, through, order, hardening, recent, developments, include, the, additions, of, transition, metals, such, as, zirconium, zr, and, rare, earth, metals, like, erbium, er, produce, shells, surrounding, the, spherical, al, 3, sc, precipitate, that, reduce, coarsening, these, shells, are, dictated, by, the, diffusivity, of, the, alloying, element, and, lower, the, cost, of, the, alloy, due, to, less, sc, being, substituted, in, part, by, zr, while, maintaining, stability, and, less, sc, being, needed, to, form, the, precipitate, these, have, made, al, 3, sc, somewhat, competitive, with, titanium, alloys, along, with, a, wide, array, of, applications, however, titanium, alloys, which, are, similar, in, lightness, and, strength, are, cheaper, and, much, more, widely, used, the, alloy, al, 20, li, 20, mg, 10, sc, 20, ti, 30, is, as, strong, as, titanium, light, as, aluminium, and, hard, as, some, ceramics, some, items, of, sports, equipment, which, rely, on, lightweight, high, performance, materials, have, been, made, with, scandium, aluminium, alloys, including, baseball, bats, tent, poles, and, bicycle, frames, and, components, lacrosse, sticks, are, also, made, with, scandium, the, american, firearm, manufacturing, company, smith, wesson, produces, semi, automatic, pistols, and, revolvers, with, frames, of, scandium, alloy, and, cylinders, of, titanium, or, carbon, steel, since, 2013, apworks, gmbh, a, spin, off, of, airbus, have, marketed, a, high, strength, scandium, containing, aluminium, alloy, processed, using, metal, 3d, printing, laser, powder, bed, fusion, under, the, trademark, scalmalloy, which, claims, very, high, strength, ductility, the, first, scandium, based, metal, halide, lamps, were, patented, by, general, electric, and, made, in, north, america, although, they, are, now, produced, in, all, major, industrialized, countries, approximately, 20, kg, of, scandium, as, sc, 2, o, 3, is, used, annually, in, the, united, states, for, high, intensity, discharge, lamps, one, type, of, metal, halide, lamp, similar, to, the, mercury, vapor, lamp, is, made, from, scandium, triiodide, and, sodium, iodide, this, lamp, is, a, white, light, source, with, high, color, rendering, index, that, sufficiently, resembles, sunlight, to, allow, good, color, reproduction, with, tv, cameras, about, 80, kg, of, scandium, is, used, in, metal, halide, lamps, light, bulbs, globally, per, year, dentists, use, erbium, chromium, doped, yttrium, scandium, gallium, garnet, er, cr, ysgg, lasers, for, cavity, preparation, and, in, endodontics, the, radioactive, isotope, 46, sc, is, used, in, oil, refineries, as, a, tracing, agent, scandium, triflate, is, a, catalytic, lewis, acid, used, in, organic, chemistry, the, 12, 4, kev, nuclear, transition, of, 45, sc, has, been, studied, as, a, reference, for, timekeeping, applications, with, a, theoretical, precision, as, much, as, three, orders, of, magnitude, better, than, the, current, caesium, reference, clocks, elemental, scandium, is, considered, non, toxic, though, extensive, animal, testing, of, scandium, compounds, has, not, been, done, the, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, levels, for, scandium, chloride, for, rats, have, been, determined, as, 755, mg, kg, for, intraperitoneal, and, 4, g, kg, for, oral, administration, in, the, light, of, these, results, compounds, of, scandium, should, be, handled, as, compounds, of, moderate, toxicity, scandium, appears, to, be, handled, by, the, body, in, a, manner, similar, to, gallium, with, similar, hazards, involving, its, poorly, soluble, hydroxide
