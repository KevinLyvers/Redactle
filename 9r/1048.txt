in, particle, physics, a, hadron, h, d, r, n, from, ancient, greek, hadr, s, stout, thick, is, a, composite, subatomic, particle, made, of, two, or, more, quarks, held, together, by, the, strong, interaction, they, are, analogous, to, molecules, which, are, held, together, by, the, electric, force, most, of, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, comes, from, two, hadrons, the, proton, and, the, neutron, while, most, of, the, mass, of, the, protons, and, neutrons, is, in, turn, due, to, the, binding, energy, of, their, constituent, quarks, due, to, the, strong, force, hadrons, are, categorized, into, two, broad, families, baryons, made, of, an, odd, number, of, quarks, usually, three, quarks, and, mesons, made, of, an, even, number, of, quarks, usually, two, quarks, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, protons, and, neutrons, which, make, the, majority, of, the, mass, of, an, atom, are, examples, of, baryons, pions, are, an, example, of, a, meson, exotic, hadrons, containing, more, than, three, valence, quarks, have, been, discovered, in, recent, years, a, tetraquark, state, an, exotic, meson, named, the, z, 4430, was, discovered, in, 2007, by, the, belle, collaboration, and, confirmed, as, a, resonance, in, 2014, by, the, lhcb, collaboration, two, pentaquark, states, exotic, baryons, named, p, c, 4380, and, p, c, 4450, were, discovered, in, 2015, by, the, lhcb, collaboration, there, are, several, more, exotic, hadron, candidates, and, other, colour, singlet, quark, combinations, that, may, also, exist, almost, all, free, hadrons, and, antihadrons, meaning, in, isolation, and, not, bound, within, an, atomic, nucleus, are, believed, to, be, unstable, and, eventually, decay, into, other, particles, the, only, known, possible, exception, is, free, protons, which, appear, to, be, stable, or, at, least, take, immense, amounts, of, time, to, decay, order, of, 10, 34, years, by, way, of, comparison, free, neutrons, are, the, longest, lived, unstable, particle, and, decay, with, a, half, life, of, about, 611, seconds, and, have, a, mean, lifetime, of, 879, seconds, see, free, neutron, decay, hadron, physics, is, studied, by, colliding, hadrons, e, g, protons, with, each, other, or, the, nuclei, of, dense, heavy, elements, such, as, lead, pb, or, gold, au, and, detecting, the, debris, in, the, produced, particle, showers, a, similar, process, occurs, in, the, natural, environment, in, the, extreme, upper, atmosphere, where, muons, and, mesons, such, as, pions, are, produced, by, the, collisions, of, cosmic, rays, with, rarefied, gas, particles, in, the, outer, atmosphere, the, term, hadron, is, a, new, greek, word, introduced, by, l, b, okun, in, a, plenary, talk, at, the, 1962, international, conference, on, high, energy, physics, at, cern, he, opened, his, talk, with, the, definition, of, a, new, category, term, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, this, report, deals, with, weak, interactions, we, shall, frequently, have, to, speak, of, strongly, interacting, particles, these, particles, pose, not, only, numerous, scientific, problems, but, also, a, terminological, problem, the, point, is, that, strongly, interacting, particles, is, a, very, clumsy, term, which, does, not, yield, itself, to, the, formation, of, an, adjective, for, this, reason, to, take, but, one, instance, decays, into, strongly, interacting, particles, are, called, non, leptonic, this, definition, is, not, exact, because, non, leptonic, may, also, signify, photonic, in, this, report, i, shall, call, strongly, interacting, particles, hadrons, and, the, corresponding, decays, hadronic, the, greek, signifies, large, massive, in, contrast, to, which, means, small, light, i, hope, that, this, terminology, will, prove, to, be, convenient, l, b, okun, 1962, according, to, the, quark, model, the, properties, of, hadrons, are, primarily, determined, by, their, so, called, valence, quarks, for, example, a, proton, is, composed, of, two, up, quarks, each, with, electric, charge, 2, 3, for, a, total, of, 4, 3, together, and, one, down, quark, with, electric, charge, 1, 3, adding, these, together, yields, the, proton, charge, of, 1, although, quarks, also, carry, color, charge, hadrons, must, have, zero, total, color, charge, because, of, a, phenomenon, called, color, confinement, that, is, hadrons, must, be, colorless, or, white, the, simplest, ways, for, this, to, occur, are, with, a, quark, of, one, color, and, an, antiquark, of, the, corresponding, anticolor, or, three, quarks, of, different, colors, hadrons, with, the, first, arrangement, are, a, type, of, meson, and, those, with, the, second, arrangement, are, a, type, of, baryon, massless, virtual, gluons, compose, the, overwhelming, majority, of, particles, inside, hadrons, as, well, as, the, major, constituents, of, its, mass, with, the, exception, of, the, heavy, charm, and, bottom, quarks, the, top, quark, vanishes, before, it, has, time, to, bind, into, a, hadron, the, strength, of, the, strong, force, gluons, which, bind, the, quarks, together, has, sufficient, energy, e, to, have, resonances, composed, of, massive, m, quarks, e, mc, 2, one, outcome, is, that, short, lived, pairs, of, virtual, quarks, and, antiquarks, are, continually, forming, and, vanishing, again, inside, a, hadron, because, the, virtual, quarks, are, not, stable, wave, packets, quanta, but, an, irregular, and, transient, phenomenon, it, is, not, meaningful, to, ask, which, quark, is, real, and, which, virtual, only, the, small, excess, is, apparent, from, the, outside, in, the, form, of, a, hadron, therefore, when, a, hadron, or, anti, hadron, is, stated, to, consist, of, typically, 2, or, 3, quarks, this, technically, refers, to, the, constant, excess, of, quarks, vs, antiquarks, like, all, subatomic, particles, hadrons, are, assigned, quantum, numbers, corresponding, to, the, representations, of, the, poincar, group, j, pc, m, where, j, is, the, spin, quantum, number, p, the, intrinsic, parity, or, p, parity, c, the, charge, conjugation, or, c, parity, and, m, is, the, particle, s, mass, note, that, the, mass, of, a, hadron, has, very, little, to, do, with, the, mass, of, its, valence, quarks, rather, due, to, mass, energy, equivalence, most, of, the, mass, comes, from, the, large, amount, of, energy, associated, with, the, strong, interaction, hadrons, may, also, carry, flavor, quantum, numbers, such, as, isospin, g, parity, and, strangeness, all, quarks, carry, an, additive, conserved, quantum, number, called, a, baryon, number, b, which, is, 1, 3, for, quarks, and, 1, 3, for, antiquarks, this, means, that, baryons, composite, particles, made, of, three, five, or, a, larger, odd, number, of, quarks, have, b, 1, whereas, mesons, have, b, 0, hadrons, have, excited, states, known, as, resonances, each, ground, state, hadron, may, have, several, excited, states, several, hundred, different, resonances, have, been, observed, in, experiments, resonances, decay, extremely, quickly, within, about, 10, 24, seconds, via, the, strong, nuclear, force, in, other, phases, of, matter, the, hadrons, may, disappear, for, example, at, very, high, temperature, and, high, pressure, unless, there, are, sufficiently, many, flavors, of, quarks, the, theory, of, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, predicts, that, quarks, and, gluons, will, no, longer, be, confined, within, hadrons, because, the, strength, of, the, strong, interaction, diminishes, with, energy, this, property, which, is, known, as, asymptotic, freedom, has, been, experimentally, confirmed, in, the, energy, range, between, 1, gev, gigaelectronvolt, and, 1, tev, teraelectronvolt, all, free, hadrons, except, possibly, the, proton, and, antiproton, are, unstable, baryons, are, hadrons, containing, an, odd, number, of, valence, quarks, at, least, 3, most, well, known, baryons, such, as, the, proton, and, neutron, have, three, valence, quarks, but, pentaquarks, with, five, quarks, three, quarks, of, different, colors, and, also, one, extra, quark, antiquark, pair, have, also, been, proven, to, exist, because, baryons, have, an, odd, number, of, quarks, they, are, also, all, fermions, i, e, they, have, half, integer, spin, as, quarks, possess, baryon, number, b, 1, 3, baryons, have, baryon, number, b, 1, pentaquarks, also, have, b, 1, since, the, extra, quark, s, and, antiquark, s, baryon, numbers, cancel, each, type, of, baryon, has, a, corresponding, antiparticle, antibaryon, in, which, quarks, are, replaced, by, their, corresponding, antiquarks, for, example, just, as, a, proton, is, made, of, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, its, corresponding, antiparticle, the, antiproton, is, made, of, two, up, antiquarks, and, one, down, antiquark, as, of, august, 2015, there, are, two, known, pentaquarks, p, c, 4380, and, p, c, 4450, both, discovered, in, 2015, by, the, lhcb, collaboration, mesons, are, hadrons, containing, an, even, number, of, valence, quarks, at, least, 2, most, well, known, mesons, are, composed, of, a, quark, antiquark, pair, but, possible, tetraquarks, 4, quarks, and, hexaquarks, 6, quarks, comprising, either, a, dibaryon, or, three, quark, antiquark, pairs, may, have, been, discovered, and, are, being, investigated, to, confirm, their, nature, several, other, hypothetical, types, of, exotic, meson, may, exist, which, do, not, fall, within, the, quark, model, of, classification, these, include, glueballs, and, hybrid, mesons, mesons, bound, by, excited, gluons, because, mesons, have, an, even, number, of, quarks, they, are, also, all, bosons, with, integer, spin, i, e, 0, 1, or, 1, they, have, baryon, number, b, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, examples, of, mesons, commonly, produced, in, particle, physics, experiments, include, pions, and, kaons, pions, also, play, a, role, in, holding, atomic, nuclei, together, via, the, residual, strong, force
