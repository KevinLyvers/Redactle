a, red, giant, is, a, luminous, giant, star, of, low, or, intermediate, mass, roughly, 0, 3, 8, solar, masses, m, in, a, late, phase, of, stellar, evolution, the, outer, atmosphere, is, inflated, and, tenuous, making, the, radius, large, and, the, surface, temperature, around, 5, 000, k, 4, 700, c, 8, 500, f, or, lower, the, appearance, of, the, red, giant, is, from, yellow, white, to, reddish, orange, including, the, spectral, types, k, and, m, sometimes, g, but, also, class, s, stars, and, most, carbon, stars, red, giants, vary, in, the, way, by, which, they, generate, energy, many, of, the, well, known, bright, stars, are, red, giants, because, they, are, luminous, and, moderately, common, the, k0, rgb, star, arcturus, is, 36, light, years, away, and, gacrux, is, the, nearest, m, class, giant, at, 88, light, years, distance, a, red, giant, will, usually, produce, a, planetary, nebula, and, become, a, white, dwarf, at, the, end, of, its, life, a, red, giant, is, a, star, that, has, exhausted, the, supply, of, hydrogen, in, its, core, and, has, begun, thermonuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, in, a, shell, surrounding, the, core, they, have, radii, tens, to, hundreds, of, times, larger, than, that, of, the, sun, however, their, outer, envelope, is, lower, in, temperature, giving, them, a, yellowish, orange, hue, despite, the, lower, energy, density, of, their, envelope, red, giants, are, many, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, because, of, their, great, size, red, giant, branch, stars, have, luminosities, up, to, nearly, three, thousand, times, that, of, the, sun, l, spectral, types, of, k, or, m, have, surface, temperatures, of, 3, 000, 4, 000, k, and, radii, up, to, about, 200, times, the, sun, r, stars, on, the, horizontal, branch, are, hotter, with, only, a, small, range, of, luminosities, around, 75, l, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, range, from, similar, luminosities, as, the, brighter, stars, of, the, red, giant, branch, up, to, several, times, more, luminous, at, the, end, of, the, thermal, pulsing, phase, among, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, belong, the, carbon, stars, of, type, c, n, and, late, c, r, produced, when, carbon, and, other, elements, are, convected, to, the, surface, in, what, is, called, a, dredge, up, the, first, dredge, up, occurs, during, hydrogen, shell, burning, on, the, red, giant, branch, but, does, not, produce, a, large, carbon, abundance, at, the, surface, the, second, and, sometimes, third, dredge, up, occurs, during, helium, shell, burning, on, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, and, convects, carbon, to, the, surface, in, sufficiently, massive, stars, the, stellar, limb, of, a, red, giant, is, not, sharply, defined, contrary, to, their, depiction, in, many, illustrations, rather, due, to, the, very, low, mass, density, of, the, envelope, such, stars, lack, a, well, defined, photosphere, and, the, body, of, the, star, gradually, transitions, into, a, corona, the, coolest, red, giants, have, complex, spectra, with, molecular, lines, emission, features, and, sometimes, masers, particularly, from, thermally, pulsing, agb, stars, observations, have, also, provided, evidence, of, a, hot, chromosphere, above, the, photosphere, of, red, giants, where, investigating, the, heating, mechanisms, for, the, chromospheres, to, form, requires, 3d, simulations, of, red, giants, another, noteworthy, feature, of, red, giants, is, that, unlike, sun, like, stars, whose, photospheres, have, a, large, number, of, small, convection, cells, solar, granules, red, giant, photospheres, as, well, as, those, of, red, supergiants, have, just, a, few, large, cells, the, features, of, which, cause, the, variations, of, brightness, so, common, on, both, types, of, stars, red, giants, are, evolved, from, main, sequence, stars, with, masses, in, the, range, from, about, 0, 3, m, to, around, 8, m, when, a, star, initially, forms, from, a, collapsing, molecular, cloud, in, the, interstellar, medium, it, contains, primarily, hydrogen, and, helium, with, trace, amounts, of, metals, in, stellar, structure, this, simply, refers, to, any, element, that, is, not, hydrogen, or, helium, i, e, atomic, number, greater, than, 2, these, elements, are, all, uniformly, mixed, throughout, the, star, the, star, reaches, the, main, sequence, when, the, core, reaches, a, temperature, high, enough, to, begin, fusing, hydrogen, a, few, million, kelvin, and, establishes, hydrostatic, equilibrium, over, its, main, sequence, life, the, star, slowly, converts, the, hydrogen, in, the, core, into, helium, its, main, sequence, life, ends, when, nearly, all, the, hydrogen, in, the, core, has, been, fused, for, the, sun, the, main, sequence, lifetime, is, approximately, 10, billion, years, more, massive, stars, burn, disproportionately, faster, and, so, have, a, shorter, lifetime, than, less, massive, stars, when, the, star, exhausts, the, hydrogen, fuel, in, its, core, nuclear, reactions, can, no, longer, continue, at, the, core, and, so, the, core, begins, to, contract, due, to, the, diminishing, force, of, the, fusion, which, used, to, push, against, gravity, and, results, in, the, core, heating, up, the, increased, temperature, of, the, core, causes, hydrogen, in, a, shell, around, the, core, to, be, burned, and, the, star, to, expand, the, hydrogen, burning, shell, results, in, a, situation, that, has, been, described, as, the, mirror, principle, when, the, core, within, the, shell, contracts, the, layers, of, the, star, outside, the, shell, must, expand, the, detailed, physical, processes, that, cause, this, are, complex, still, the, behavior, is, necessary, to, satisfy, simultaneous, conservation, of, gravitational, and, thermal, energy, in, a, star, with, the, shell, structure, the, core, contracts, and, heats, up, due, to, the, lack, of, fusion, and, so, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, expand, greatly, absorbing, most, of, the, extra, energy, from, shell, fusion, this, process, of, cooling, and, expanding, is, the, subgiant, star, when, the, envelope, of, the, star, cools, sufficiently, it, becomes, convective, the, star, stops, expanding, its, luminosity, starts, to, increase, and, the, star, is, ascending, the, red, giant, branch, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, h, r, diagram, the, evolutionary, path, the, star, takes, as, it, moves, along, the, red, giant, branch, depends, on, the, mass, of, the, star, for, the, sun, and, stars, of, less, than, about, 2, m, the, core, will, become, dense, enough, that, electron, degeneracy, pressure, will, prevent, it, from, collapsing, further, once, the, core, is, degenerate, it, will, continue, to, heat, until, it, reaches, a, temperature, of, roughly, 10, 8, k, hot, enough, to, begin, fusing, helium, to, carbon, via, the, triple, alpha, process, once, the, degenerate, core, reaches, this, temperature, the, entire, core, will, begin, helium, fusion, nearly, simultaneously, in, a, so, called, helium, flash, in, more, massive, stars, the, collapsing, core, will, reach, 10, 8, k, before, it, is, dense, enough, to, be, degenerate, so, helium, fusion, will, begin, much, more, smoothly, and, produce, no, helium, flash, the, core, helium, fusing, phase, of, a, star, s, life, is, called, the, horizontal, branch, in, metal, poor, stars, so, named, because, these, stars, lie, on, a, nearly, horizontal, line, in, the, h, r, diagram, of, many, star, clusters, metal, rich, helium, fusing, stars, instead, lie, on, the, so, called, red, clump, in, the, h, r, diagram, an, analogous, process, occurs, when, the, central, helium, is, exhausted, and, the, star, collapses, once, again, causing, helium, in, a, shell, to, begin, fusing, at, the, same, time, hydrogen, may, begin, fusion, in, a, shell, just, outside, the, burning, helium, shell, this, puts, the, star, onto, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, a, second, red, giant, phase, the, helium, fusion, results, in, the, build, up, of, a, carbon, oxygen, core, a, star, below, about, 8, m, will, never, start, fusion, in, its, degenerate, carbon, oxygen, core, instead, at, the, end, of, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, the, star, will, eject, its, outer, layers, forming, a, planetary, nebula, with, the, core, of, the, star, exposed, ultimately, becoming, a, white, dwarf, the, ejection, of, the, outer, mass, and, the, creation, of, a, planetary, nebula, finally, ends, the, red, giant, phase, of, the, star, s, evolution, the, red, giant, phase, typically, lasts, only, around, a, billion, years, in, total, for, a, solar, mass, star, almost, all, of, which, is, spent, on, the, red, giant, branch, the, horizontal, branch, and, asymptotic, giant, branch, phases, proceed, tens, of, times, faster, if, the, star, has, about, 0, 2, to, 0, 5, m, it, is, massive, enough, to, become, a, red, giant, but, does, not, have, enough, mass, to, initiate, the, fusion, of, helium, these, intermediate, stars, cool, somewhat, and, increase, their, luminosity, but, never, achieve, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, and, helium, core, flash, when, the, ascent, of, the, red, giant, branch, ends, they, puff, off, their, outer, layers, much, like, a, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, star, and, then, become, a, white, dwarf, very, low, mass, stars, are, fully, convective, and, may, continue, to, fuse, hydrogen, into, helium, for, up, to, a, trillion, years, until, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, entire, star, is, hydrogen, luminosity, and, temperature, steadily, increase, during, this, time, just, as, for, more, massive, main, sequence, stars, but, the, length, of, time, involved, means, that, the, temperature, eventually, increases, by, about, 50, and, the, luminosity, by, around, 10, times, eventually, the, level, of, helium, increases, to, the, point, where, the, star, ceases, to, be, fully, convective, and, the, remaining, hydrogen, locked, in, the, core, is, consumed, in, only, a, few, billion, more, years, depending, on, mass, the, temperature, and, luminosity, continue, to, increase, for, a, time, during, hydrogen, shell, burning, the, star, can, become, hotter, than, the, sun, and, tens, of, times, more, luminous, than, when, it, formed, although, still, not, as, luminous, as, the, sun, after, some, billions, more, years, they, start, to, become, less, luminous, and, cooler, even, though, hydrogen, shell, burning, continues, these, become, cool, helium, white, dwarfs, very, high, mass, stars, develop, into, supergiants, that, follow, an, evolutionary, track, that, takes, them, back, and, forth, horizontally, over, the, h, r, diagram, at, the, right, end, constituting, red, supergiants, these, usually, end, their, life, as, a, type, ii, supernova, the, most, massive, stars, can, become, wolf, rayet, stars, without, becoming, giants, or, supergiants, at, all, although, traditionally, it, has, been, suggested, the, evolution, of, a, star, into, a, red, giant, will, render, its, planetary, system, if, present, uninhabitable, some, research, suggests, that, during, the, evolution, of, a, 1, m, star, along, the, red, giant, branch, it, could, harbor, a, habitable, zone, for, several, billion, years, at, 2, astronomical, units, au, out, to, around, 100, million, years, at, 9, au, out, giving, perhaps, enough, time, for, life, to, develop, on, a, suitable, world, after, the, red, giant, stage, there, would, for, such, a, star, be, a, habitable, zone, between, 7, and, 22, au, for, an, additional, one, billion, years, later, studies, have, refined, this, scenario, showing, how, for, a, 1, m, star, the, habitable, zone, lasts, from, 100, million, years, for, a, planet, with, an, orbit, similar, to, that, of, mars, to, 210, million, years, for, one, that, orbits, at, saturn, s, distance, to, the, sun, the, maximum, time, 370, million, years, corresponding, for, planets, orbiting, at, the, distance, of, jupiter, however, planets, orbiting, a, 0, 5, m, star, in, equivalent, orbits, to, those, of, jupiter, and, saturn, would, be, in, the, habitable, zone, for, 5, 8, billion, years, and, 2, 1, billion, years, respectively, for, stars, more, massive, than, the, sun, the, times, are, considerably, shorter, as, of, 2023, several, hundred, giant, planets, have, been, discovered, around, giant, stars, however, these, giant, planets, are, more, massive, than, the, giant, planets, found, around, solar, type, stars, this, could, be, because, giant, stars, are, more, massive, than, the, sun, less, massive, stars, will, still, be, on, the, main, sequence, and, will, not, have, become, giants, yet, and, more, massive, stars, are, expected, to, have, more, massive, planets, however, the, masses, of, the, planets, that, have, been, found, around, giant, stars, do, not, correlate, with, the, masses, of, the, stars, therefore, the, planets, could, be, growing, in, mass, during, the, stars, red, giant, phase, the, growth, in, planet, mass, could, be, partly, due, to, accretion, from, stellar, wind, although, a, much, larger, effect, would, be, roche, lobe, overflow, causing, mass, transfer, from, the, star, to, the, planet, when, the, giant, expands, out, to, the, orbital, distance, of, the, planet, many, of, the, well, known, bright, stars, are, red, giants, because, they, are, luminous, and, moderately, common, the, red, giant, branch, variable, star, gamma, crucis, is, the, nearest, m, class, giant, star, at, 88, light, years, the, k1, 5, red, giant, branch, star, arcturus, is, 36, light, years, away, the, sun, will, exit, the, main, sequence, in, approximately, 5, billion, years, and, start, to, turn, into, a, red, giant, as, a, red, giant, the, sun, will, grow, so, large, over, 200, times, its, present, day, radius, 215, r, 1, au, that, it, will, engulf, mercury, venus, and, likely, earth, it, will, lose, 38, of, its, mass, growing, then, will, die, into, a, white, dwarf, media,
