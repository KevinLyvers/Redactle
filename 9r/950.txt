in, classical, mechanics, a, harmonic, oscillator, is, a, system, that, when, displaced, from, its, equilibrium, position, experiences, a, restoring, force, f, proportional, to, the, displacement, x, f, k, x, displaystyle, vec, f, k, vec, x, where, k, is, a, positive, constant, if, f, is, the, only, force, acting, on, the, system, the, system, is, called, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, and, it, undergoes, simple, harmonic, motion, sinusoidal, oscillations, about, the, equilibrium, point, with, a, constant, amplitude, and, a, constant, frequency, which, does, not, depend, on, the, amplitude, if, a, frictional, force, damping, proportional, to, the, velocity, is, also, present, the, harmonic, oscillator, is, described, as, a, damped, oscillator, depending, on, the, friction, coefficient, the, system, can, the, boundary, solution, between, an, underdamped, oscillator, and, an, overdamped, oscillator, occurs, at, a, particular, value, of, the, friction, coefficient, and, is, called, critically, damped, if, an, external, time, dependent, force, is, present, the, harmonic, oscillator, is, described, as, a, driven, oscillator, mechanical, examples, include, pendulums, with, small,

frac, mathrm, d, 2, mathrm, d, t, 2, x, t, ma, the, latter, being, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, if, the, initial, displacement, is, a, and, there, is, no, initial, velocity, the, solution, of, this, equation, is, given, by, x, t, a, cos, k, m, t, displaystyle, x, t, a, cos, left, sqrt, frac, k, m, t, right, given, an, ideal, massless, spring, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, on, the, end, of, the, spring, if, the, spring, itself, has, mass, its, effective, mass, must, be, included, in, m, displaystyle, m, in, terms, of, energy, all, systems, have, two, types, of, energy, potential, energy, and, kinetic, energy, when, a, spring, is, stretched, or, compressed, it, stores, elastic, potential, energy, which, is, then, transferred, into, kinetic, energy, the, potential, energy, within, a, spring, is, determined, by, the, equation, u, 1, 2, k, x, 2, textstyle, u, frac, 1, 2, kx, 2, when, the, spring, is, stretched, or, compressed, kinetic, energy, of, the, mass, gets, converted, into, potential, energy, of, the, spring, by, conservation, of, energy, assuming, the, datum, is, defined, at, the, equilibrium, position, when, the, spring, reaches, its, maximal, potential, energy, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, mass, is, zero, when, the, spring, is, released, it, tries, to, return, to, equilibrium, and, all, its, potential, energy, converts, to, kinetic, energy, of, the, mass
