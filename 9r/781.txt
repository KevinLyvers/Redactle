https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere
the, cryosphere, is, an, umbrella, term, for, those, portions, of, earth, s, surface, where, water, is, in, solid, form, this, includes, sea, ice, ice, on, lakes, or, rivers, snow, glaciers, ice, caps, ice, sheets, and, frozen, ground, which, includes, permafrost, thus, there, is, a, overlap, with, the, hydrosphere, the, cryosphere, is, an, integral, part, of, the, global, climate, system, it, also, has, important, feedbacks, on, the, climate, system, these, feedbacks, come, from, the, cryosphere, s, influence, on, surface, energy, and, moisture, fluxes, clouds, the, water, cycle, atmospheric, and, oceanic, circulation, through, these, feedback, processes, the, cryosphere, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, global, climate, and, in, climate, model, response, to, global, changes, approximately, 10, of, the, earth, s, surface, is, covered, by, ice, but, this, is, rapidly, decreasing, current, reductions, in, the, cryosphere, caused, by, climate, change, are, measurable, in, ice, sheet, melt, glaciers, decline, sea, ice, decline, permafrost, thaw, and, snow, cover, decrease, the, cryosphere, describes, those, portions, of, earth, s, surface, where, water, is, in, solid, form, frozen, water, is, found, on, the, earth, s, surface, primarily, as, snow, cover, freshwater, ice, in, lakes, and, rivers, sea, ice, glaciers, ice, sheets, and, frozen, ground, and, permafrost, permanently, frozen, ground, the, cryosphere, is, one, of, five, components, of, the, climate, system, the, others, are, the, atmosphere, the, hydrosphere, the, lithosphere, and, the, biosphere, 1451, the, term, cryosphere, comes, from, the, greek, word, kryos, meaning, cold, frost, or, ice, and, the, greek, word, sphaira, meaning, globe, or, ball, cryospheric, sciences, is, an, umbrella, term, for, the, study, of, the, cryosphere, as, an, interdisciplinary, earth, science, many, disciplines, contribute, to, it, most, notably, geology, hydrology, and, meteorology, and, climatology, in, this, sense, it, is, comparable, to, glaciology, the, term, deglaciation, describes, the, retreat, of, cryospheric, features, there, are, several, fundamental, physical, properties, of, snow, and, ice, that, modulate, energy, exchanges, between, the, surface, and, the, atmosphere, the, most, important, properties, are, the, surface, reflectance, albedo, the, ability, to, transfer, heat, thermal, diffusivity, and, the, ability, to, change, state, latent, heat, these, physical, properties, together, with, surface, roughness, emissivity, and, dielectric, characteristics, have, important, implications, for, observing, snow, and, ice, from, space, for, example, surface, roughness, is, often, the, dominant, factor, determining, the, strength, of, radar, backscatter, physical, properties, such, as, crystal, structure, density, length, and, liquid, water, content, are, important, factors, affecting, the, transfers, of, heat, and, water, and, the, scattering, of, microwave, energy, the, residence, time, of, water, in, each, of, the, cryospheric, sub, systems, varies, widely, snow, cover, and, freshwater, ice, are, essentially, seasonal, and, most, sea, ice, except, for, ice, in, the, central, arctic, lasts, only, a, few, years, if, it, is, not, seasonal, a, given, water, particle, in, glaciers, ice, sheets, or, ground, ice, however, may, remain, frozen, for, 10, 100, 000, years, or, longer, and, deep, ice, in, parts, of, east, antarctica, may, have, an, age, approaching, 1, million, years, most, of, the, world, s, ice, volume, is, in, antarctica, principally, in, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, in, terms, of, areal, extent, however, northern, hemisphere, winter, snow, and, ice, extent, comprise, the, largest, area, amounting, to, an, average, 23, of, hemispheric, surface, area, in, january, the, large, areal, extent, and, the, important, climatic, roles, of, snow, and, ice, is, related, to, their, unique, physical, properties, this, also, indicates, that, the, ability, to, observe, and, model, snow, and, ice, cover, extent, thickness, and, physical, properties, radiative, and, thermal, properties, is, of, particular, significance, for, climate, research, the, surface, reflectance, of, incoming, solar, radiation, is, important, for, the, surface, energy, balance, seb, it, is, the, ratio, of, reflected, to, incident, solar, radiation, commonly, referred, to, as, albedo, climatologists, are, primarily, interested, in, albedo, integrated, over, the, shortwave, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, 300, to, 3500, nm, which, coincides, with, the, main, solar, energy, input, typically, albedo, values, for, non, melting, snow, covered, surfaces, are, high, 80, 90, except, in, the, case, of, forests, the, higher, albedos, for, snow, and, ice, cause, rapid, shifts, in, surface, reflectivity, in, autumn, and, spring, in, high, latitudes, but, the, overall, climatic, significance, of, this, increase, is, spatially, and, temporally, modulated, by, cloud, cover, planetary, albedo, is, determined, principally, by, cloud, cover, and, by, the, small, amount, of, total, solar, radiation, received, in, high, latitudes, during, winter, months, summer, and, autumn, are, times, of, high, average, cloudiness, over, the, arctic, ocean, so, the, albedo, feedback, associated, with, the, large, seasonal, changes, in, sea, ice, extent, is, greatly, reduced, it, was, found, that, snow, cover, exhibited, the, greatest, influence, on, earth, s, radiative, balance, in, the, spring, april, to, may, period, when, incoming, solar, radiation, was, greatest, over, snow, covered, areas, the, thermal, properties, of, cryospheric, elements, also, have, important, climatic, consequences, snow, and, ice, have, much, lower, thermal, diffusivities, than, air, thermal, diffusivity, is, a, measure, of, the, speed, at, which, temperature, waves, can, penetrate, a, substance, snow, and, ice, are, many, orders, of, magnitude, less, efficient, at, diffusing, heat, than, air, snow, cover, insulates, the, ground, surface, and, sea, ice, insulates, the, underlying, ocean, decoupling, the, surface, atmosphere, interface, with, respect, to, both, heat, and, moisture, fluxes, the, flux, of, moisture, from, a, water, surface, is, eliminated, by, even, a, thin, skin, of, ice, whereas, the, flux, of, heat, through, thin, ice, continues, to, be, substantial, until, it, attains, a, thickness, in, excess, of, 30, to, 40, cm, however, even, a, small, amount, of, snow, on, top, of, the, ice, will, dramatically, reduce, the, heat, flux, and, slow, down, the, rate, of, ice, growth, the, insulating, effect, of, snow, also, has, major, implications, for, the, hydrological, cycle, in, non, permafrost, regions, the, insulating, effect, of, snow, is, such, that, only, near, surface, ground, freezes, and, deep, water, drainage, is, uninterrupted, while, snow, and, ice, act, to, insulate, the, surface, from, large, energy, losses, in, winter, they, also, act, to, retard, warming, in, the, spring, and, summer, because, of, the, large, amount, of, energy, required, to, melt, ice, the, latent, heat, of, fusion, 3, 34, x, 10, 5, j, kg, at, 0, c, however, the, strong, static, stability, of, the, atmosphere, over, areas, of, extensive, snow, or, ice, tends, to, confine, the, immediate, cooling, effect, to, a, relatively, shallow, layer, so, that, associated, atmospheric, anomalies, are, usually, short, lived, and, local, to, regional, in, scale, in, some, areas, of, the, world, such, as, eurasia, however, the, cooling, associated, with, a, heavy, snowpack, and, moist, spring, soils, is, known, to, play, a, role, in, modulating, the, summer, monsoon, circulation, there, are, numerous, cryosphere, climate, feedbacks, in, the, global, climate, system, these, operate, over, a, wide, range, of, spatial, and, temporal, scales, from, local, seasonal, cooling, of, air, temperatures, to, hemispheric, scale, variations, in, ice, sheets, over, time, scales, of, thousands, of, years, the, feedback, mechanisms, involved, are, often, complex, and, incompletely, understood, for, example, curry, et, al, 1995, showed, that, the, so, called, simple, sea, ice, albedo, feedback, involved, complex, interactions, with, lead, fraction, melt, ponds, ice, thickness, snow, cover, and, sea, ice, extent, the, role, of, snow, cover, in, modulating, the, monsoon, is, just, one, example, of, a, short, term, cryosphere, climate, feedback, involving, the, land, surface, and, the, atmosphere, ice, sheets, and, glaciers, are, flowing, ice, masses, that, rest, on, solid, land, they, are, controlled, by, snow, accumulation, surface, and, basal, melt, calving, into, surrounding, oceans, or, lakes, and, internal, dynamics, the, latter, results, from, gravity, driven, creep, flow, glacial, flow, within, the, ice, body, and, sliding, on, the, underlying, land, which, leads, to, thinning, and, horizontal, spreading, any, imbalance, of, this, dynamic, equilibrium, between, mass, gain, loss, and, transport, due, to, flow, results, in, either, growing, or, shrinking, ice, bodies, relationships, between, global, climate, and, changes, in, ice, extent, are, complex, the, mass, balance, of, land, based, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, is, determined, by, the, accumulation, of, snow, mostly, in, winter, and, warm, season, ablation, due, primarily, to, net, radiation, and, turbulent, heat, fluxes, to, melting, ice, and, snow, from, warm, air, advection, where, ice, masses, terminate, in, the, ocean, iceberg, calving, is, the, major, contributor, to, mass, loss, in, this, situation, the, ice, margin, may, extend, out, into, deep, water, as, a, floating, ice, shelf, such, as, that, in, the, ross, sea, a, glacier, us, l, e, r, uk, l, s, i, r, l, e, s, i, r, is, a, persistent, body, of, dense, ice, that, is, constantly, moving, downhill, under, its, own, weight, a, glacier, forms, where, the, accumulation, of, snow, exceeds, its, ablation, over, many, years, often, centuries, it, acquires, distinguishing, features, such, as, crevasses, and, seracs, as, it, slowly, flows, and, deforms, under, stresses, induced, by, its, weight, as, it, moves, it, abrades, rock, and, debris, from, its, substrate, to, create, landforms, such, as, cirques, moraines, or, fjords, although, a, glacier, may, flow, into, a, body, of, water, it, forms, only, on, land, and, is, distinct, from, the, much, thinner, sea, ice, and, lake, ice, that, form, on, the, surface, of, bodies, of, water, on, earth, 99, of, glacial, ice, is, contained, within, vast, ice, sheets, also, known, as, continental, glaciers, in, the, polar, regions, but, glaciers, may, be, found, in, mountain, ranges, on, every, continent, other, than, the, australian, mainland, including, oceania, s, high, latitude, oceanic, island, countries, such, as, new, zealand, between, latitudes, 35, n, and, 35, s, glaciers, occur, only, in, the, himalayas, andes, and, a, few, high, mountains, in, east, africa, mexico, new, guinea, and, on, zard, kuh, in, iran, with, more, than, 7, 000, known, glaciers, pakistan, has, more, glacial, ice, than, any, other, country, outside, the, polar, regions, glaciers, cover, about, 10, of, earth, s, land, surface, continental, glaciers, cover, nearly, 13, million, km, 2, 5, million, sq, mi, or, about, 98, of, antarctica, s, 13, 2, million, km, 2, 5, 1, million, sq, mi, with, an, average, thickness, of, ice, 2, 100, m, 7, 000, ft, greenland, and, patagonia, also, have, huge, expanses, of, continental, glaciers, the, volume, of, glaciers, not, including, the, ice, sheets, of, antarctica, and, greenland, has, been, estimated, at, 170, 000, km, 3, in, glaciology, an, ice, sheet, also, known, as, a, continental, glacier, is, a, mass, of, glacial, ice, that, covers, surrounding, terrain, and, is, greater, than, 50, 000, km, 2, 19, 000, sq, mi, the, only, current, ice, sheets, are, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, and, the, greenland, ice, sheet, ice, sheets, are, bigger, than, ice, shelves, or, alpine, glaciers, masses, of, ice, covering, less, than, 50, 000, km, 2, are, termed, an, ice, cap, an, ice, cap, will, typically, feed, a, series, of, glaciers, around, its, periphery, although, the, surface, is, cold, the, base, of, an, ice, sheet, is, generally, warmer, due, to, geothermal, heat, in, places, melting, occurs, and, the, melt, water, lubricates, the, ice, sheet, so, that, it, flows, more, rapidly, this, process, produces, fast, flowing, channels, in, the, ice, sheet, these, are, ice, streams, even, stable, ice, sheets, are, continually, in, motion, as, the, ice, gradually, flows, outward, from, the, central, plateau, which, is, the, tallest, point, of, the, ice, sheet, and, towards, the, margins, the, ice, sheet, slope, is, low, around, the, plateau, but, increases, steeply, at, the, margins, increasing, global, air, temperatures, due, to, climate, change, take, around, 10, 000, years, to, directly, propagate, through, the, ice, before, they, influence, bed, temperatures, but, may, have, an, effect, through, increased, surface, melting, producing, more, supraglacial, lakes, these, lakes, may, feed, warm, water, to, glacial, bases, and, facilitate, glacial, motion, sea, ice, covers, much, of, the, polar, oceans, and, forms, by, freezing, of, sea, water, satellite, data, since, the, early, 1970s, reveal, considerable, seasonal, regional, and, interannual, variability, in, the, sea, ice, covers, of, both, hemispheres, seasonally, sea, ice, extent, in, the, southern, hemisphere, varies, by, a, factor, of, 5, from, a, minimum, of, 3, 4, million, km, 2, in, february, to, a, maximum, of, 17, 20, million, km, 2, in, september, the, seasonal, variation, is, much, less, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, the, confined, nature, and, high, latitudes, of, the, arctic, ocean, result, in, a, much, larger, perennial, ice, cover, and, the, surrounding, land, limits, the, equatorward, extent, of, wintertime, ice, thus, the, seasonal, variability, in, northern, hemisphere, ice, extent, varies, by, only, a, factor, of, 2, from, a, minimum, of, 7, 9, million, km, 2, in, september, to, a, maximum, of, 14, 16, million, km, 2, in, march, the, ice, cover, exhibits, much, greater, regional, scale, interannual, variability, than, it, does, hemispherical, for, instance, in, the, region, of, the, sea, of, okhotsk, and, japan, maximum, ice, extent, decreased, from, 1, 3, million, km, 2, in, 1983, to, 0, 85, million, km, 2, in, 1984, a, decrease, of, 35, before, rebounding, the, following, year, to, 1, 2, million, km, 2, the, regional, fluctuations, in, both, hemispheres, are, such, that, for, any, several, year, period, of, the, satellite, record, some, regions, exhibit, decreasing, ice, coverage, while, others, exhibit, increasing, ice, cover, permafrost, from, perma, permanent, and, frost, is, soil, or, underwater, sediment, which, continuously, remains, below, 0, c, 32, f, for, two, years, or, more, the, oldest, permafrost, had, been, continuously, frozen, for, around, 700, 000, years, whilst, the, shallowest, permafrost, has, a, vertical, extent, of, below, a, meter, 3, ft, the, deepest, is, greater, than, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, similarly, the, area, of, individual, permafrost, zones, may, be, limited, to, narrow, mountain, summits, or, extend, across, vast, arctic, regions, the, ground, beneath, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, is, not, usually, defined, as, permafrost, so, on, land, permafrost, is, generally, located, beneath, a, so, called, active, layer, of, soil, which, freezes, and, thaws, depending, on, the, season, around, 15, of, the, northern, hemisphere, or, 11, of, the, global, surface, is, underlain, by, permafrost, covering, a, total, area, of, around, 18, million, km, 2, 6, 9, million, sq, mi, this, includes, large, areas, of, alaska, canada, greenland, and, siberia, it, is, also, located, in, high, mountain, regions, with, the, tibetan, plateau, being, a, prominent, example, only, a, minority, of, permafrost, exists, in, the, southern, hemisphere, where, it, is, consigned, to, mountain, slopes, like, in, the, andes, of, patagonia, the, southern, alps, of, new, zealand, or, the, highest, mountains, of, antarctica, most, of, the, earth, s, snow, covered, area, is, located, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, varies, seasonally, from, 46, 5, million, km, 2, in, january, to, 3, 8, million, km, 2, in, august, snow, cover, is, an, extremely, important, storage, component, in, the, water, balance, especially, seasonal, snowpacks, in, mountainous, areas, of, the, world, though, limited, in, extent, seasonal, snowpacks, in, the, earth, s, mountain, ranges, account, for, the, major, source, of, the, runoff, for, stream, flow, and, groundwater, recharge, over, wide, areas, of, the, midlatitudes, for, example, over, 85, of, the, annual, runoff, from, the, colorado, river, basin, originates, as, snowmelt, snowmelt, runoff, from, the, earth, s, mountains, fills, the, rivers, and, recharges, the, aquifers, that, over, a, billion, people, depend, on, for, their, water, resources, furthermore, over, 40, of, the, world, s, protected, areas, are, in, mountains, attesting, to, their, value, both, as, unique, ecosystems, needing, protection, and, as, recreation, areas, for, humans, ice, forms, on, rivers, and, lakes, in, response, to, seasonal, cooling, the, sizes, of, the, ice, bodies, involved, are, too, small, to, exert, anything, other, than, localized, climatic, effects, however, the, freeze, up, break, up, processes, respond, to, large, scale, and, local, weather, factors, such, that, considerable, interannual, variability, exists, in, the, dates, of, appearance, and, disappearance, of, the, ice, long, series, of, lake, ice, observations, can, serve, as, a, proxy, climate, record, and, the, monitoring, of, freeze, up, and, break, up, trends, may, provide, a, convenient, integrated, and, seasonally, specific, index, of, climatic, perturbations, information, on, river, ice, conditions, is, less, useful, as, a, climatic, proxy, because, ice, formation, is, strongly, dependent, on, river, flow, regime, which, is, affected, by, precipitation, snow, melt, and, watershed, runoff, as, well, as, being, subject, to, human, interference, that, directly, modifies, channel, flow, or, that, indirectly, affects, the, runoff, via, land, use, practices, lake, freeze, up, depends, on, the, heat, storage, in, the, lake, and, therefore, on, its, depth, the, rate, and, temperature, of, any, inflow, and, water, air, energy, fluxes, information, on, lake, depth, is, often, unavailable, although, some, indication, of, the, depth, of, shallow, lakes, in, the, arctic, can, be, obtained, from, airborne, radar, imagery, during, late, winter, sellman, et, al, 1975, and, spaceborne, optical, imagery, during, summer, duguay, and, lafleur, 1997, the, timing, of, breakup, is, modified, by, snow, depth, on, the, ice, as, well, as, by, ice, thickness, and, freshwater, inflow, the, greenland, ice, sheet, is, an, ice, sheet, which, forms, the, second, largest, body, of, ice, in, the, world, it, is, an, average, of, 1, 67, km, 1, 0, mi, thick, and, over, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, thick, at, its, maximum, it, is, almost, 2, 900, kilometres, 1, 800, mi, long, in, a, north, south, direction, with, a, maximum, width, of, 1, 100, kilometres, 680, mi, at, a, latitude, of, 77, n, near, its, northern, edge, the, ice, sheet, covers, 1, 710, 000, square, kilometres, 660, 000, sq, mi, around, 80, of, the, surface, of, greenland, or, about, 12, of, the, area, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, the, term, greenland, ice, sheet, is, often, shortened, to, gis, or, gris, in, scientific, literature, the, retreat, of, glaciers, since, 1850, is, well, documented, and, is, one, of, the, effects, of, climate, change, the, retreat, of, mountain, glaciers, provide, evidence, for, the, rise, in, global, temperatures, since, the, late, 19th, century, examples, include, mountain, glaciers, in, western, north, america, asia, the, alps, in, central, europe, and, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, of, south, america, and, africa, since, glacial, mass, is, affected, by, long, term, climatic, changes, e, g, precipitation, mean, temperature, and, cloud, cover, glacial, mass, changes, are, one, of, the, most, sensitive, indicators, of, climate, change, retreat, of, glaciers, is, also, a, major, reason, for, sea, level, rise, excluding, peripheral, glaciers, of, ice, sheets, the, total, cumulated, global, glacial, losses, over, the, 26, year, period, from, 1993, to, 2018, were, likely, 5500, gigatons, or, 210, gigatons, per, yr, 1275, sea, ice, reflects, 50, to, 70, of, the, incoming, solar, radiation, back, into, space, only, 6, of, incoming, solar, energy, is, reflected, by, the, ocean, as, the, climate, warms, the, area, covered, by, snow, or, sea, ice, decreases, after, sea, ice, melts, more, energy, is, absorbed, by, the, ocean, so, it, warms, up, this, ice, albedo, feedback, is, a, self, reinforcing, feedback, of, climate, change, large, scale, measurements, of, sea, ice, have, only, been, possible, since, satellites, came, into, use, sea, ice, in, the, arctic, has, declined, in, recent, decades, in, area, and, volume, due, to, climate, change, it, has, been, melting, more, in, summer, than, it, refreezes, in, winter, the, decline, of, sea, ice, in, the, arctic, has, been, accelerating, during, the, early, twenty, first, century, it, has, a, rate, of, decline, of, 4, 7, per, decade, it, has, declined, over, 50, since, the, first, satellite, records, ice, free, summers, are, expected, to, be, rare, at, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, degrees, of, warming, they, are, set, to, occur, at, least, once, every, decade, with, a, warming, level, of, 2, c, 3, 6, f, 8, the, arctic, will, likely, become, ice, free, at, the, end, of, some, summers, before, 2050, 9, studies, in, 2021, found, that, northern, hemisphere, snow, cover, has, been, decreasing, since, 1978, along, with, snow, depth, paleoclimate, observations, show, that, such, changes, are, unprecedented, over, the, last, millennia, in, western, north, america, north, american, winter, snow, cover, increased, during, the, 20th, century, largely, in, response, to, an, increase, in, precipitation, because, of, its, close, relationship, with, hemispheric, air, temperature, snow, cover, is, an, important, indicator, of, climate, change, global, warming, is, expected, to, result, in, major, changes, to, the, partitioning, of, snow, and, rainfall, and, to, the, timing, of, snowmelt, which, will, have, important, implications, for, water, use, and, management, these, changes, also, involve, potentially, important, decadal, and, longer, time, scale, feedbacks, to, the, climate, system, through, temporal, and, spatial, changes, in, soil, moisture, and, runoff, to, the, oceans, walsh, 1995, freshwater, fluxes, from, the, snow, cover, into, the, marine, environment, may, be, important, as, the, total, flux, is, probably, of, the, same, magnitude, as, desalinated, ridging, and, rubble, areas, of, sea, ice, in, addition, there, is, an, associated, pulse, of, precipitated, pollutants, which, accumulate, over, the, arctic, winter, in, snowfall, and, are, released, into, the, ocean, upon, ablation, of, the, sea, ice
