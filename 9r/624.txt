a, mountain, range, or, hill, range, is, a, series, of, mountains, or, hills, arranged, in, a, line, and, connected, by, high, ground, a, mountain, system, or, mountain, belt, is, a, group, of, mountain, ranges, with, similarity, in, form, structure, and, alignment, that, have, arisen, from, the, same, cause, usually, an, orogeny, mountain, ranges, are, formed, by, a, variety, of, geological, processes, but, most, of, the, significant, ones, on, earth, are, the, result, of, plate, tectonics, mountain, ranges, are, also, found, on, many, planetary, mass, objects, in, the, solar, system, and, are, likely, a, feature, of, most, terrestrial, planets, mountain, ranges, are, usually, segmented, by, highlands, or, mountain, passes, and, valleys, individual, mountains, within, the, same, mountain, range, do, not, necessarily, have, the, same, geologic, structure, or, petrology, they, may, be, a, mix, of, different, orogenic, expressions, and, terranes, for, example, thrust, sheets, uplifted, blocks, fold, mountains, and, volcanic, landforms, resulting, in, a, variety, of, rock, types, most, geologically, young, mountain, ranges, on, the, earth, s, land, surface, are, associated, with, either, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, or, the, alpide, belt, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, includes, the, andes, of, south, america, extends, through, the, north, american, cordillera, the, aleutian, range, on, through, kamchatka, peninsula, japan, taiwan, the, philippines, papua, new, guinea, to, new, zealand, the, andes, is, 7, 000, kilometres, 4, 350, mi, long, and, is, often, considered, the, world, s, longest, mountain, system, the, alpide, belt, stretches, 15, 000, km, across, southern, eurasia, from, java, in, maritime, southeast, asia, to, the, iberian, peninsula, in, western, europe, including, the, ranges, of, the, himalayas, karakoram, hindu, kush, alborz, caucasus, and, the, alps, the, himalayas, contain, the, highest, mountains, in, the, world, including, mount, everest, which, is, 8, 848, metres, 29, 029, ft, high, mountain, ranges, outside, these, two, systems, include, the, arctic, cordillera, appalachians, great, dividing, range, east, siberians, altais, scandinavians, qinling, western, ghats, vindhyas, byrrangas, and, the, annamite, range, if, the, definition, of, a, mountain, range, is, stretched, to, include, underwater, mountains, then, the, ocean, ridge, forms, the, longest, continuous, mountain, system, on, earth, with, a, length, of, 65, 000, kilometres, 40, 400, mi, the, position, of, mountain, ranges, influences, climate, such, as, rain, or, snow, when, air, masses, move, up, and, over, mountains, the, air, cools, producing, orographic, precipitation, rain, or, snow, as, the, air, descends, on, the, leeward, side, it, warms, again, following, the, adiabatic, lapse, rate, and, is, drier, having, been, stripped, of, much, of, its, moisture, often, a, rain, shadow, will, affect, the, leeward, side, of, a, range, as, a, consequence, large, mountain, ranges, such, as, the, andes, compartmentalize, continents, into, distinct, climate, regions, mountain, ranges, are, constantly, subjected, to, erosional, forces, which, work, to, tear, them, down, the, basins, adjacent, to, an, eroding, mountain, range, are, then, filled, with, sediments, that, are, buried, and, turned, into, sedimentary, rock, erosion, is, at, work, while, the, mountains, are, being, uplifted, until, the, mountains, are, reduced, to, low, hills, and, plains, the, early, cenozoic, uplift, of, the, rocky, mountains, of, colorado, provides, an, example, as, the, uplift, was, occurring, some, 10, 000, feet, 3, 000, m, of, mostly, mesozoic, sedimentary, strata, were, removed, by, erosion, over, the, core, of, the, mountain, range, and, spread, as, sand, and, clays, across, the, great, plains, to, the, east, this, mass, of, rock, was, removed, as, the, range, was, actively, undergoing, uplift, the, removal, of, such, a, mass, from, the, core, of, the, range, most, likely, caused, further, uplift, as, the, region, adjusted, isostatically, in, response, to, the, removed, weight, rivers, are, traditionally, believed, to, be, the, principal, cause, of, mountain, range, erosion, by, cutting, into, bedrock, and, transporting, sediment, computer, simulation, has, shown, that, as, mountain, belts, change, from, tectonically, active, to, inactive, the, rate, of, erosion, drops, because, there, are, fewer, abrasive, particles, in, the, water, and, fewer, landslides, mountains, on, other, planets, and, natural, satellites, of, the, solar, system, including, the, moon, are, often, isolated, and, formed, mainly, by, processes, such, as, impacts, though, there, are, examples, of, mountain, ranges, or, montes, somewhat, similar, to, those, on, earth, saturn, s, moon, titan, and, pluto, in, particular, exhibit, large, mountain, ranges, in, chains, composed, mainly, of, ices, rather, than, rock, examples, include, the, mithrim, montes, and, doom, mons, on, titan, and, tenzing, montes, and, hillary, montes, on, pluto, some, terrestrial, planets, other, than, earth, also, exhibit, rocky, mountain, ranges, such, as, maxwell, montes, on, venus, taller, than, any, on, earth, and, tartarus, montes, on, mars, jupiter, s, moon, io, has, mountain, ranges, formed, from, tectonic, processes, including, the, bo, saule, dorian, hi, iaka, and, euboea, montes
