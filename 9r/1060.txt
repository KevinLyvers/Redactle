onia, in, particle, physics, every, type, of, particle, of, ordinary, matter, as, opposed, to, antimatter, is, associated, with, an, antiparticle, with, the, same, mass, but, with, opposite, physical, charges, such, as, electric, charge, for, example, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, is, the, positron, also, known, as, an, antielectron, while, the, electron, has, a, negative, electric, charge, the, positron, has, a, positive, electric, charge, and, is, produced, naturally, in, certain, types, of, radioactive, decay, the, opposite, is, also, true, the, antiparticle, of, the, positron, is, the, electron, some, particles, such, as, the, photon, are, their, own, antiparticle, otherwise, for, each, pair, of, antiparticle, partners, one, is, designated, as, the, normal, particle, the, one, that, occurs, in, matter, usually, interacted, with, in, daily, life, the, other, usually, given, the, prefix, anti, is, designated, the, antiparticle, particle, antiparticle, pairs, can, annihilate, each, other, producing, photons, since, the, charges, of, the, particle, and, antiparticle, are, opposite, total, charge, is, conserved, for, example, the, positrons, produced, in, natural, radioactive, decay, quickly, annihilate, themselves, with, electrons, producing, pairs, of, gamma, rays, a, process, exploited, in, positron, emission, tomography, the, laws, of, nature, are, very, nearly, symmetrical, with, respect, to, particles, and, antiparticles, for, example, an, antiproton, and, a, positron, can, form, an, antihydrogen, atom, which, is, believed, to, have, the, same, properties, as, a, hydrogen, atom, this, leads, to, the, question, of, why, the, formation, of, matter, after, the, big, bang, resulted, in, a, universe, consisting, almost, entirely, of, matter, rather, than, being, a, half, and, half, mixture, of, matter, and, antimatter, the, discovery, of, charge, parity, violation, helped, to, shed, light, on, this, problem, by, showing, that, this, symmetry, originally, thought, to, be, perfect, was, only, approximate, the, question, about, how, the, formation, of, matter, after, the, big, bang, resulted, in, a, universe, consisting, almost, entirely, of, matter, remains, an, unanswered, one, and, explanations, so, far, are, not, truly, satisfactory, overall, because, charge, is, conserved, it, is, not, possible, to, create, an, antiparticle, without, either, destroying, another, particle, of, the, same, charge, as, is, for, instance, the, case, when, antiparticles, are, produced, naturally, via, beta, decay, or, the, collision, of, cosmic, rays, with, earth, s, atmosphere, or, by, the, simultaneous, creation, of, both, a, particle, and, its, antiparticle, pair, production, which, can, occur, in, particle, accelerators, such, as, the, large, hadron, collider, at, cern, particles, and, their, antiparticles, have, equal, and, opposite, charges, so, that, an, uncharged, particle, also, gives, rise, to, an, uncharged, antiparticle, in, many, cases, the, antiparticle, and, the, particle, coincide, pairs, of, photons, z, 0, bosons, 0, mesons, and, hypothetical, gravitons, and, some, hypothetical, wimps, all, self, annihilate, however, electrically, neutral, particles, need, not, be, identical, to, their, antiparticles, for, example, the, neutron, and, antineutron, are, distinct, in, 1932, soon, after, the, prediction, of, positrons, by, paul, dirac, carl, d, anderson, found, that, cosmic, ray, collisions, produced, these, particles, in, a, cloud, chamber, a, particle, detector, in, which, moving, electrons, or, positrons, leave, behind, trails, as, they, move, through, the, gas, the, electric, charge, to, mass, ratio, of, a, particle, can, be, measured, by, observing, the, radius, of, curling, of, its, cloud, chamber, track, in, a, magnetic, field, positrons, because, of, the, direction, that, their, paths, curled, were, at, first, mistaken, for, electrons, travelling, in, the, opposite, direction, positron, paths, in, a, cloud, chamber, trace, the, same, helical, path, as, an, electron, but, rotate, in, the, opposite, direction, with, respect, to, the, magnetic, field, direction, due, to, their, having, the, same, magnitude, of, charge, to, mass, ratio, but, with, opposite, charge, and, therefore, opposite, signed, charge, to, mass, ratios, the, antiproton, and, antineutron, were, found, by, emilio, segr, and, owen, chamberlain, in, 1955, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, since, then, the, antiparticles, of, many, other, subatomic, particles, have, been, created, in, particle, accelerator, experiments, in, recent, years, complete, atoms, of, antimatter, have, been, assembled, out, of, antiprotons, and, positrons, collected, in, electromagnetic, traps, the, development, of, quantum, field, theory, made, the, interpretation, of, antiparticles, as, holes, unnecessary, even, though, it, lingers, on, in, many, textbooks, steven, weinberg, solutions, of, the, dirac, equation, contain, negative, energy, quantum, states, as, a, result, an, electron, could, always, radiate, energy, and, fall, into, a, negative, energy, state, even, worse, it, could, keep, radiating, infinite, amounts, of, energy, because, there, were, infinitely, many, negative, energy, states, available, to, prevent, this, unphysical, situation, from, happening, dirac, proposed, that, a, sea, of, negative, energy, electrons, fills, the, universe, already, occupying, all, of, the, lower, energy, states, so, that, due, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, no, other, electron, could, fall, into, them, sometimes, however, one, of, these, negative, energy, particles, could, be, lifted, out, of, this, dirac, sea, to, become, a, positive, energy, particle, but, when, lifted, out, it, would, leave, behind, a, hole, in, the, sea, that, would, act, exactly, like, a, positive, energy, electron, with, a, reversed, charge, these, holes, were, interpreted, as, negative, energy, electrons, by, paul, dirac, and, mistakenly, identified, with, protons, in, his, 1930, paper, a, theory, of, electrons, and, protons, however, these, negative, energy, electrons, turned, out, to, be, positrons, and, not, protons, this, picture, implied, an, infinite, negative, charge, for, the, universe, a, problem, of, which, dirac, was, aware, dirac, tried, to, argue, that, we, would, perceive, this, as, the, normal, state, of, zero, charge, another, difficulty, was, the, difference, in, masses, of, the, electron, and, the, proton, dirac, tried, to, argue, that, this, was, due, to, the, electromagnetic, interactions, with, the, sea, until, hermann, weyl, proved, that, hole, theory, was, completely, symmetric, between, negative, and, positive, charges, dirac, also, predicted, a, reaction, e, p, where, an, electron, and, a, proton, annihilate, to, give, two, photons, robert, oppenheimer, and, igor, tamm, however, proved, that, this, would, cause, ordinary, matter, to, disappear, too, fast, a, year, later, in, 1931, dirac, modified, his, theory, and, postulated, the, positron, a, new, particle, of, the, same, mass, as, the, electron, the, discovery, of, this, particle, the, next, year, removed, the, last, two, objections, to, his, theory, within, dirac, s, theory, the, problem, of, infinite, charge, of, the, universe, remains, some, bosons, also, have, antiparticles, but, since, bosons, do, not, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, only, fermions, do, hole, theory, does, not, work, for, them, a, unified, interpretation, of, antiparticles, is, now, available, in, quantum, field, theory, which, solves, both, these, problems, by, describing, antimatter, as, negative, energy, states, of, the, same, underlying, matter, field, i, e, particles, moving, backwards, in, time, e, if, a, particle, and, antiparticle, are, in, the, appropriate, quantum, states, then, they, can, annihilate, each, other, and, produce, other, particles, reactions, such, as, e, e, the, two, photon, annihilation, of, an, electron, positron, pair, are, an, example, the, single, photon, annihilation, of, an, electron, positron, pair, e, e, cannot, occur, in, free, space, because, it, is, impossible, to, conserve, energy, and, momentum, together, in, this, process, however, in, the, coulomb, field, of, a, nucleus, the, translational, invariance, is, broken, and, single, photon, annihilation, may, occur, the, reverse, reaction, in, free, space, without, an, atomic, nucleus, is, also, impossible, for, this, reason, in, quantum, field, theory, this, process, is, allowed, only, as, an, intermediate, quantum, state, for, times, short, enough, that, the, violation, of, energy, conservation, can, be, accommodated, by, the, uncertainty, principle, this, opens, the, way, for, virtual, pair, production, or, annihilation, in, which, a, one, particle, quantum, state, may, fluctuate, into, a, two, particle, state, and, back, these, processes, are, important, in, the, vacuum, state, and, renormalization, of, a, quantum, field, theory, it, also, opens, the, way, for, neutral, particle, mixing, through, processes, such, as, the, one, pictured, here, which, is, a, complicated, example, of, mass, renormalization, quantum, states, of, a, particle, and, an, antiparticle, are, interchanged, by, the, combined, application, of, charge, conjugation, c, displaystyle, c, parity, p, displaystyle, p, and, time, reversal, t, displaystyle, t, c, displaystyle, c, and, p, displaystyle, p, are, linear, unitary, operators, t, displaystyle, t, is, antilinear, and, antiunitary, t, t, 1, displaystyle, langle, psi, t, phi, rangle, langle, phi, t, 1, psi, rangle, if, p, n, displaystyle, p, sigma, n, rangle, denotes, the, quantum, state, of, a, particle, n, displaystyle, n, with, momentum, p, displaystyle, p, and, spin, j, displaystyle, j, whose, component, in, the, z, direction, is, displaystyle, sigma, then, one, has, where, n, c, displaystyle, n, c, denotes, the, charge, conjugate, state, that, is, the, antiparticle, in, particular, a, massive, particle, and, its, antiparticle, transform, under, the, same, irreducible, representation, of, the, poincar, group, which, means, the, antiparticle, has, the, same, mass, and, the, same, spin, if, c, displaystyle, c, p, displaystyle, p, and, t, displaystyle, t, can, be, defined, separately, on, the, particles, and, antiparticles, then, where, the, proportionality, sign, indicates, that, there, might, be, a, phase, on, the, right, hand, side, as, c, p, t, displaystyle, cpt, anticommutes, with, the, charges, c, p, t, q, q, c, p, t, displaystyle, cpt, q, q, cpt, particle, and, antiparticle, have, opposite, electric, charges, q, and, q, one, may, try, to, quantize, an, electron, field, without, mixing, the, annihilation, and, creation, operators, by, writing, where, we, use, the, symbol, k, to, denote, the, quantum, numbers, p, and, of, the, previous, section, and, the, sign, of, the, energy, e, k, and, a, k, denotes, the, corresponding, annihilation, operators, of, course, since, we, are, dealing, with, fermions, we, have, to, have, the, operators, satisfy, canonical, anti, commutation, relations, however, if, one, now, writes, down, the, hamiltonian, then, one, sees, immediately, that, the, expectation, value, of, h, need, not, be, positive, this, is, because, e, k, can, have, any, sign, whatsoever, and, the, combination, of, creation, and, annihilation, operators, has, expectation, value, 1, or, 0, so, one, has, to, introduce, the, charge, conjugate, antiparticle, field, with, its, own, creation, and, annihilation, operators, satisfying, the, relations, where, k, has, the, same, p, and, opposite, and, sign, of, the, energy, then, one, can, rewrite, the, field, in, the, form, where, the, first, sum, is, over, positive, energy, states, and, the, second, over, those, of, negative, energy, the, energy, becomes, where, e, 0, is, an, infinite, negative, constant, the, vacuum, state, is, defined, as, the, state, with, no, particle, or, antiparticle, i, e, a, k, 0, 0, displaystyle, a, k, 0, rangle, 0, and, b, k, 0, 0, displaystyle, b, k, 0, rangle, 0, then, the, energy, of, the, vacuum, is, exactly, e, 0, since, all, energies, are, measured, relative, to, the, vacuum, h, is, positive, definite, analysis, of, the, properties, of, a, k, and, b, k, shows, that, one, is, the, annihilation, operator, for, particles, and, the, other, for, antiparticles, this, is, the, case, of, a, fermion, this, approach, is, due, to, vladimir, fock, wendell, furry, and, robert, oppenheimer, if, one, quantizes, a, real, scalar, field, then, one, finds, that, there, is, only, one, kind, of, annihilation, operator, therefore, real, scalar, fields, describe, neutral, bosons, since, complex, scalar, fields, admit, two, different, kinds, of, annihilation, operators, which, are, related, by, conjugation, such, fields, describe, charged, bosons, by, considering, the, propagation, of, the, negative, energy, modes, of, the, electron, field, backward, in, time, ernst, st, ckelberg, reached, a, pictorial, understanding, of, the, fact, that, the, particle, and, antiparticle, have, equal, mass, m, and, spin, j, but, opposite, charges, q, this, allowed, him, to, rewrite, perturbation, theory, precisely, in, the, form, of, diagrams, richard, feynman, later, gave, an, independent, systematic, derivation, of, these, diagrams, from, a, particle, formalism, and, they, are, now, called, feynman, diagrams, each, line, of, a, diagram, represents, a, particle, propagating, either, backward, or, forward, in, time, in, feynman, diagrams, anti, particles, are, shown, traveling, backwards, in, time, relative, to, normal, matter, and, vice, versa, this, technique, is, the, most, widespread, method, of, computing, amplitudes, in, quantum, field, theory, today, since, this, picture, was, first, developed, by, st, ckelberg, and, acquired, its, modern, form, in, feynman, s, work, it, is, called, the, feynman, st, ckelberg, interpretation, of, antiparticles, to, honor, both, scientists
