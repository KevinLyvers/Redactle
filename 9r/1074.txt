pressure, symbol, p, or, p, is, the, force, applied, perpendicular, to, the, surface, of, an, object, per, unit, area, over, which, that, force, is, distributed, 445, gauge, pressure, also, spelled, gage, pressure, is, the, pressure, relative, to, the, ambient, pressure, various, units, are, used, to, express, pressure, some, of, these, derive, from, a, unit, of, force, divided, by, a, unit, of, area, the, si, unit, of, pressure, the, pascal, pa, for, example, is, one, newton, per, square, metre, n, m, 2, similarly, the, pound, force, per, square, inch, psi, symbol, lbf, in, 2, is, the, traditional, unit, of, pressure, in, the, imperial, and, us, customary, systems, pressure, may, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, standard, atmospheric, pressure, the, unit, atmosphere, atm, is, equal, to, this, pressure, and, the, torr, is, defined, as, 1, 760, of, this, manometric, units, such, as, the, centimetre, of, water, millimetre, of, mercury, and, inch, of, mercury, are, used, to, express, pressures, in, terms, of, the, height, of, column, of, a, particular, fluid, in, a, manometer, pressure, is, the, amount, of, force, applied, perpendicular, to, the, surface, of, an, object, per, unit, area, the, symbol, for, it, is, p, or, p, the, iupac, recommendation, for, pressure, is, a, lower, case, p, however, upper, case, p, is, widely, used, the, usage, of, p, vs, p, depends, upon, the, field, in, which, one, is, working, on, the, nearby, presence, of, other, symbols, for, quantities, such, as, power, and, momentum, and, on, writing, style, mathematically, p, f, a, displaystyle, p, frac, f, a, where, pressure, is, a, scalar, quantity, it, relates, the, vector, area, element, a, vector, normal, to, the, surface, with, the, normal, force, acting, on, it, the, pressure, is, the, scalar, proportionality, constant, that, relates, the, two, normal, vectors, d, f, n, p, d, a, p, n, d, a, displaystyle, d, mathbf, f, n, p, d, mathbf, a, p, mathbf, n, da, the, minus, sign, comes, from, the, convention, that, the, force, is, considered, towards, the, surface, element, while, the, normal, vector, points, outward, the, equation, has, meaning, in, that, for, any, surface, s, in, contact, with, the, fluid, the, total, force, exerted, by, the, fluid, on, that, surface, is, the, surface, integral, over, s, of, the, right, hand, side, of, the, above, equation, it, is, incorrect, although, rather, usual, to, say, the, pressure, is, directed, in, such, or, such, direction, the, pressure, as, a, scalar, has, no, direction, the, force, given, by, the, previous, relationship, to, the, quantity, has, a, direction, but, the, pressure, does, not, if, we, change, the, orientation, of, the, surface, element, the, direction, of, the, normal, force, changes, accordingly, but, the, pressure, remains, the, same, pressure, is, distributed, to, solid, boundaries, or, across, arbitrary, sections, of, fluid, normal, to, these, boundaries, or, sections, at, every, point, it, is, a, fundamental, parameter, in, thermodynamics, and, it, is, conjugate, to, volume, the, si, unit, for, pressure, is, the, pascal, pa, equal, to, one, newton, per, square, metre, n, m, 2, or, kg, m, 1, s, 2, this, name, for, the, unit, was, added, in, 1971, before, that, pressure, in, si, was, expressed, in, newtons, per, square, metre, other, units, of, pressure, such, as, pounds, per, square, inch, lbf, in, 2, and, bar, are, also, in, common, use, the, cgs, unit, of, pressure, is, the, barye, ba, equal, to, 1, dyn, cm, 2, or, 0, 1, pa, pressure, is, sometimes, expressed, in, grams, force, or, kilograms, force, per, square, centimetre, g, cm, 2, or, kg, cm, 2, and, the, like, without, properly, identifying, the, force, units, but, using, the, names, kilogram, gram, kilogram, force, or, gram, force, or, their, symbols, as, units, of, force, is, deprecated, in, si, the, technical, atmosphere, symbol, at, is, 1, kgf, cm, 2, 98, 0665, kpa, or, 14, 223, psi, pressure, is, related, to, energy, density, and, may, be, expressed, in, units, such, as, joules, per, cubic, metre, j, m, 3, which, is, equal, to, pa, mathematically, p, f, distance, a, distance, work, volume, energy, j, volume, m, 3, displaystyle, p, frac, f, cdot, text, distance, a, cdot, text, distance, frac, text, work, text, volume, frac, text, energy, j, text, volume, text, m, 3, some, meteorologists, prefer, the, hectopascal, hpa, for, atmospheric, air, pressure, which, is, equivalent, to, the, older, unit, millibar, mbar, similar, pressures, are, given, in, kilopascals, kpa, in, most, other, fields, except, aviation, where, the, hecto, prefix, is, commonly, used, the, inch, of, mercury, is, still, used, in, the, united, states, oceanographers, usually, measure, underwater, pressure, in, decibars, dbar, because, pressure, in, the, ocean, increases, by, approximately, one, decibar, per, metre, depth, the, standard, atmosphere, atm, is, an, established, constant, it, is, approximately, equal, to, typical, air, pressure, at, earth, mean, sea, level, and, is, defined, as, 101, 325, pa, because, pressure, is, commonly, measured, by, its, ability, to, displace, a, column, of, liquid, in, a, manometer, pressures, are, often, expressed, as, a, depth, of, a, particular, fluid, e, g, centimetres, of, water, millimetres, of, mercury, or, inches, of, mercury, the, most, common, choices, are, mercury, hg, and, water, water, is, nontoxic, and, readily, available, while, mercury, s, high, density, allows, a, shorter, column, and, so, a, smaller, manometer, to, be, used, to, measure, a, given, pressure, the, pressure, exerted, by, a, column, of, liquid, of, height, h, and, density, is, given, by, the, hydrostatic, pressure, equation, p, gh, where, g, is, the, gravitational, acceleration, fluid, density, and, local, gravity, can, vary, from, one, reading, to, another, depending, on, local, factors, so, the, height, of, a, fluid, column, does, not, define, pressure, precisely, when, millimetres, of, mercury, or, inches, of, mercury, are, quoted, today, these, units, are, not, based, on, a, physical, column, of, mercury, rather, they, have, been, given, precise, definitions, that, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, si, units, one, millimetre, of, mercury, is, approximately, equal, to, one, torr, the, water, based, units, still, depend, on, the, density, of, water, a, measured, rather, than, defined, quantity, these, manometric, units, are, still, encountered, in, many, fields, blood, pressure, is, measured, in, millimetres, or, centimetres, of, mercury, in, most, of, the, world, and, lung, pressures, in, centimetres, of, water, are, still, common, underwater, divers, use, the, metre, sea, water, msw, or, msw, and, foot, sea, water, fsw, or, fsw, units, of, pressure, and, these, are, the, units, for, pressure, gauges, used, to, measure, pressure, exposure, in, diving, chambers, and, personal, decompression, computers, a, msw, is, defined, as, 0, 1, bar, 10, 000, pa, is, not, the, same, as, a, linear, metre, of, depth, 33, 066, fsw, 1, atm, 1, atm, 101, 325, pa, 33, 066, 3, 064, 326, pa, the, pressure, conversion, from, msw, to, fsw, is, different, from, the, length, conversion, 10, msw, 32, 6336, fsw, while, 10, m, 32, 8083, ft, gauge, pressure, is, often, given, in, units, with, g, appended, e, g, kpag, barg, or, psig, and, units, for, measurements, of, absolute, pressure, are, sometimes, given, a, suffix, of, a, to, avoid, confusion, for, example, kpaa, psia, however, the, us, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, recommends, that, to, avoid, confusion, any, modifiers, be, instead, applied, to, the, quantity, being, measured, rather, than, the, unit, of, measure, for, example, p, g, 100, psi, rather, than, p, 100, psig, differential, pressure, is, expressed, in, units, with, d, appended, this, type, of, measurement, is, useful, when, considering, sealing, performance, or, whether, a, valve, will, open, or, close, presently, or, formerly, popular, pressure, units, include, the, following, as, an, example, of, varying, pressures, a, finger, can, be, pressed, against, a, wall, without, making, any, lasting, impression, however, the, same, finger, pushing, a, thumbtack, can, easily, damage, the, wall, although, the, force, applied, to, the, surface, is, the, same, the, thumbtack, applies, more, pressure, because, the, point, concentrates, that, force, into, a, smaller, area, pressure, is, transmitted, to, solid, boundaries, or, across, arbitrary, sections, of, fluid, normal, to, these, boundaries, or, sections, at, every, point, unlike, stress, pressure, is, defined, as, a, scalar, quantity, the, negative, gradient, of, pressure, is, called, the, force, density, another, example, is, a, knife, if, the, flat, edge, is, used, force, is, distributed, over, a, larger, surface, area, resulting, in, less, pressure, and, it, will, not, cut, whereas, using, the, sharp, edge, which, has, less, surface, area, results, in, greater, pressure, and, so, the, knife, cuts, smoothly, this, is, one, example, of, a, practical, application, of, pressure, for, gases, pressure, is, sometimes, measured, not, as, an, absolute, pressure, but, relative, to, atmospheric, pressure, such, measurements, are, called, gauge, pressure, an, example, of, this, is, the, air, pressure, in, an, automobile, tire, which, might, be, said, to, be, 220, kpa, 32, psi, but, is, actually, 220, kpa, 32, psi, above, atmospheric, pressure, since, atmospheric, pressure, at, sea, level, is, about, 100, kpa, 14, 7, psi, the, absolute, pressure, in, the, tire, is, therefore, about, 320, kpa, 46, psi, in, technical, work, this, is, written, a, gauge, pressure, of, 220, kpa, 32, psi, where, space, is, limited, such, as, on, pressure, gauges, name, plates, graph, labels, and, table, headings, the, use, of, a, modifier, in, parentheses, such, as, kpa, gauge, or, kpa, absolute, is, permitted, in, non, si, technical, work, a, gauge, pressure, of, 32, psi, 220, kpa, is, sometimes, written, as, 32, psig, and, an, absolute, pressure, as, 32, psia, though, the, other, methods, explained, above, that, avoid, attaching, characters, to, the, unit, of, pressure, are, preferred, gauge, pressure, is, the, relevant, measure, of, pressure, wherever, one, is, interested, in, the, stress, on, storage, vessels, and, the, plumbing, components, of, fluidics, systems, however, whenever, equation, of, state, properties, such, as, densities, or, changes, in, densities, must, be, calculated, pressures, must, be, expressed, in, terms, of, their, absolute, values, for, instance, if, the, atmospheric, pressure, is, 100, kpa, 15, psi, a, gas, such, as, helium, at, 200, kpa, 29, psi, gauge, 300, kpa, or, 44, psi, is, 50, denser, than, the, same, gas, at, 100, kpa, 15, psi, gauge, 200, kpa, or, 29, psi, focusing, on, gauge, values, one, might, erroneously, conclude, the, first, sample, had, twice, the, density, of, the, second, one, in, a, static, gas, the, gas, as, a, whole, does, not, appear, to, move, the, individual, molecules, of, the, gas, however, are, in, constant, random, motion, because, there, are, an, extremely, large, number, of, molecules, and, because, the, motion, of, the, individual, molecules, is, random, in, every, direction, no, motion, is, detected, when, the, gas, is, at, least, partially, confined, that, is, not, free, to, expand, rapidly, the, gas, will, exhibit, a, hydrostatic, pressure, this, confinement, can, be, achieved, with, either, a, physical, container, of, some, sort, or, in, a, gravitational, well, such, as, a, planet, otherwise, known, as, atmospheric, pressure, in, the, case, of, planetary, atmospheres, the, pressure, gradient, force, of, the, gas, pushing, outwards, from, higher, pressure, lower, altitudes, to, lower, pressure, higher, altitudes, is, balanced, by, the, gravitational, force, preventing, the, gas, from, diffusing, into, outer, space, and, maintaining, hydrostatic, equilibrium, in, a, physical, container, the, pressure, of, the, gas, originates, from, the, molecules, colliding, with, the, walls, of, the, container, the, walls, of, the, container, can, be, anywhere, inside, the, gas, and, the, force, per, unit, area, the, pressure, is, the, same, if, the, container, is, shrunk, down, to, a, very, small, point, becoming, less, true, as, the, atomic, scale, is, approached, the, pressure, will, still, have, a, single, value, at, that, point, therefore, pressure, is, a, scalar, quantity, not, a, vector, quantity, it, has, magnitude, but, no, direction, sense, associated, with, it, pressure, force, acts, in, all, directions, at, a, point, inside, a, gas, at, the, surface, of, a, gas, the, pressure, force, acts, perpendicular, at, right, angle, to, the, surface, a, closely, related, quantity, is, the, stress, tensor, which, relates, the, vector, force, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, to, the, vector, area, a, displaystyle, mathbf, a, via, the, linear, relation, f, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, sigma, mathbf, a, this, tensor, may, be, expressed, as, the, sum, of, the, viscous, stress, tensor, minus, the, hydrostatic, pressure, the, negative, of, the, stress, tensor, is, sometimes, called, the, pressure, tensor, but, in, the, following, the, term, pressure, will, refer, only, to, the, scalar, pressure, according, to, the, theory, of, general, relativity, pressure, increases, the, strength, of, a, gravitational, field, see, stress, energy, tensor, and, so, adds, to, the, mass, energy, cause, of, gravity, this, effect, is, unnoticeable, at, everyday, pressures, but, is, significant, in, neutron, stars, although, it, has, not, been, experimentally, tested, fluid, pressure, is, most, often, the, compressive, stress, at, some, point, within, a, fluid, the, term, fluid, refers, to, both, liquids, and, gases, for, more, information, specifically, about, liquid, pressure, see, section, below, fluid, pressure, occurs, in, one, of, two, situations, pressure, in, open, conditions, usually, can, be, approximated, as, the, pressure, in, static, or, non, moving, conditions, even, in, the, ocean, where, there, are, waves, and, currents, because, the, motions, create, only, negligible, changes, in, the, pressure, such, conditions, conform, with, principles, of, fluid, statics, the, pressure, at, any, given, point, of, a, non, moving, static, fluid, is, called, the, hydrostatic, pressure, closed, bodies, of, fluid, are, either, static, when, the, fluid, is, not, moving, or, dynamic, when, the, fluid, can, move, as, in, either, a, pipe, or, by, compressing, an, air, gap, in, a, closed, container, the, pressure, in, closed, conditions, conforms, with, the, principles, of, fluid, dynamics, the, concepts, of, fluid, pressure, are, predominantly, attributed, to, the, discoveries, of, blaise, pascal, and, daniel, bernoulli, bernoulli, s, equation, can, be, used, in, almost, any, situation, to, determine, the, pressure, at, any, point, in, a, fluid, the, equation, makes, some, assumptions, about, the, fluid, such, as, the, fluid, being, ideal, and, incompressible, an, ideal, fluid, is, a, fluid, in, which, there, is, no, friction, it, is, inviscid, zero, viscosity, the, equation, for, all, points, of, a, system, filled, with, a, constant, density, fluid, is, p, v, 2, 2, g, z, c, o, n, s, t, displaystyle, frac, p, gamma, frac, v, 2, 2g, z, mathrm, const, where, explosion, or, deflagration, pressures, are, the, result, of, the, ignition, of, explosive, gases, mists, dust, air, suspensions, in, unconfined, and, confined, spaces, while, pressures, are, in, general, positive, there, are, several, situations, in, which, negative, pressures, may, be, encountered, stagnation, pressure, is, the, pressure, a, fluid, exerts, when, it, is, forced, to, stop, moving, consequently, although, a, fluid, moving, at, higher, speed, will, have, a, lower, static, pressure, it, may, have, a, higher, stagnation, pressure, when, forced, to, a, standstill, static, pressure, and, stagnation, pressure, are, related, by, p, 0, 1, 2, v, 2, p, displaystyle, p, 0, frac, 1, 2, rho, v, 2, p, where, the, pressure, of, a, moving, fluid, can, be, measured, using, a, pitot, tube, or, one, of, its, variations, such, as, a, kiel, probe, or, cobra, probe, connected, to, a, manometer, depending, on, where, the, inlet, holes, are, located, on, the, probe, it, can, measure, static, pressures, or, stagnation, pressures, there, is, a, two, dimensional, analog, of, pressure, the, lateral, force, per, unit, length, applied, on, a, line, perpendicular, to, the, force, surface, pressure, is, denoted, by, f, l, displaystyle, pi, frac, f, l, and, shares, many, similar, properties, with, three, dimensional, pressure, properties, of, surface, chemicals, can, be, investigated, by, measuring, pressure, area, isotherms, as, the, two, dimensional, analog, of, boyle, s, law, a, k, at, constant, temperature, surface, tension, is, another, example, of, surface, pressure, but, with, a, reversed, sign, because, tension, is, the, opposite, to, pressure, in, an, ideal, gas, molecules, have, no, volume, and, do, not, interact, according, to, the, ideal, gas, law, pressure, varies, linearly, with, temperature, and, quantity, and, inversely, with, volume, p, n, r, t, v, displaystyle, p, frac, nrt, v, where, real, gases, exhibit, a, more, complex, dependence, on, the, variables, of, state, vapour, pressure, is, the, pressure, of, a, vapour, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, its, condensed, phases, in, a, closed, system, all, liquids, and, solids, have, a, tendency, to, evaporate, into, a, gaseous, form, and, all, gases, have, a, tendency, to, condense, back, to, their, liquid, or, solid, form, the, atmospheric, pressure, boiling, point, of, a, liquid, also, known, as, the, normal, boiling, point, is, the, temperature, at, which, the, vapor, pressure, equals, the, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, with, any, incremental, increase, in, that, temperature, the, vapor, pressure, becomes, sufficient, to, overcome, atmospheric, pressure, and, lift, the, liquid, to, form, vapour, bubbles, inside, the, bulk, of, the, substance, bubble, formation, deeper, in, the, liquid, requires, a, higher, pressure, and, therefore, higher, temperature, because, the, fluid, pressure, increases, above, the, atmospheric, pressure, as, the, depth, increases, the, vapor, pressure, that, a, single, component, in, a, mixture, contributes, to, the, total, pressure, in, the, system, is, called, partial, vapor, pressure, when, a, person, swims, under, the, water, water, pressure, is, felt, acting, on, the, person, s, eardrums, the, deeper, that, person, swims, the, greater, the, pressure, the, pressure, felt, is, due, to, the, weight, of, the, water, above, the, person, as, someone, swims, deeper, there, is, more, water, above, the, person, and, therefore, greater, pressure, the, pressure, a, liquid, exerts, depends, on, its, depth, liquid, pressure, also, depends, on, the, density, of, the, liquid, if, someone, was, submerged, in, a, liquid, more, dense, than, water, the, pressure, would, be, correspondingly, greater, thus, we, can, say, that, the, depth, density, and, liquid, pressure, are, directly, proportionate, the, pressure, due, to, a, liquid, in, liquid, columns, of, constant, density, or, at, a, depth, within, a, substance, is, represented, by, the, following, formula, p, g, h, displaystyle, p, rho, gh, where, another, way, of, saying, the, same, formula, is, the, following, p, weight, density, depth, displaystyle, p, text, weight, density, times, text, depth, weight, density, weight, volume, displaystyle, text, weight, density, frac, text, weight, text, volume, we, can, express, this, weight, of, liquid, as, weight, weight, density, volume, displaystyle, text, weight, text, weight, density, times, text, volume, where, the, volume, of, the, column, is, simply, the, area, multiplied, by, the, depth, then, we, have, pressure, force, area, weight, area, weight,

denominator, canceling, each, other, out, we, are, left, with, pressure, weight, density, depth, displaystyle, text, pressure, text, weight, density, times, text, depth, written, with, symbols, this, is, our, original, equation, p, g, h, displaystyle, p, rho, gh, the, pressure, a, liquid, exerts, against, the, sides, and, bottom, of, a, container, depends, on, the, density, and, the, depth, of, the, liquid, if, atmospheric, pressure, is, neglected, liquid, pressure, against, the, bottom, is, twice, as, great, at, twice, the, depth, at, three, times, the, depth, the, liquid, pressure, is, threefold, etc, or, if, the, liquid, is, two, or, three, times, as, dense, the, liquid, pressure, is, correspondingly, two, or, three, times, as, great, for, any, given, depth, liquids, are, practically, incompressible, that, is, their, volume, can, hardly, be, changed, by, pressure, water, volume, decreases, by, only, 50, millionths, of, its, original, volume, for, each, atmospheric, increase, in, pressure, thus, except, for, small, changes, produced, by, temperature, the, density, of, a, particular, liquid, is, practically, the, same, at, all, depths, atmospheric, pressure, pressing, on, the, surface, of, a, liquid, must, be, taken, into, account, when, trying, to, discover, the, total, pressure, acting, on, a, liquid, the, total, pressure, of, a, liquid, then, is, gh, plus, the, pressure, of, the, atmosphere, when, this, distinction, is, important, the, term, total, pressure, is, used, otherwise, discussions, of, liquid, pressure, refer, to, pressure, without, regard, to, the, normally, ever, present, atmospheric, pressure, the, pressure, does, not, depend, on, the, amount, of, liquid, present, volume, is, not, the, important, factor, depth, is, the, average, water, pressure, acting, against, a, dam, depends, on, the, average, depth, of, the, water, and, not, on, the, volume, of, water, held, back, for, example, a, wide, but, shallow, lake, with, a, depth, of, 3, m, 10, ft, exerts, only, half, the, average, pressure, that, a, small, 6, m, 20, ft, deep, pond, does, the, total, force, applied, to, the, longer, dam, will, be, greater, due, to, the, greater, total, surface, area, for, the, pressure, to, act, upon, but, for, a, given, 5, foot, 1, 5, m, wide, section, of, each, dam, the, 10, ft, 3, 0, m, deep, water, will, apply, one, quarter, the, force, of, 20, ft, 6, 1, m, deep, water, a, person, will, feel, the, same, pressure, whether, their, head, is, dunked, a, metre, beneath, the, surface, of, the, water, in, a, small, pool, or, to, the, same, depth, in, the, middle, of, a, large, lake, if, four, interconnected, vases, contain, different, amounts, of, water, but, are, all, filled, to, equal, depths, then, a, fish, with, its, head, dunked, a, few, centimetres, under, the, surface, will, be, acted, on, by, water, pressure, that, is, the, same, in, any, of, the, vases, if, the, fish, swims, a, few, centimetres, deeper, the, pressure, on, the, fish, will, increase, with, depth, and, be, the, same, no, matter, which, vase, the, fish, is, in, if, the, fish, swims, to, the, bottom, the, pressure, will, be, greater, but, it, makes, no, difference, which, vase, it, is, in, all, vases, are, filled, to, equal, depths, so, the, water, pressure, is, the, same, at, the, bottom, of, each, vase, regardless, of, its, shape, or, volume, if, water, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, a, vase, were, greater, than, water, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, a, neighboring, vase, the, greater, pressure, would, force, water, sideways, and, then, up, the, narrower, vase, to, a, higher, level, until, the, pressures, at, the, bottom, were, equalized, pressure, is, depth, dependent, not, volume, dependent, so, there, is, a, reason, that, water, seeks, its, own, level, restating, this, as, an, energy, equation, the, energy, per, unit, volume, in, an, ideal, incompressible, liquid, is, constant, throughout, its, vessel, at, the, surface, gravitational, potential, energy, is, large, but, liquid, pressure, energy, is, low, at, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, all, the, gravitational, potential, energy, is, converted, to, pressure, energy, the, sum, of, pressure, energy, and, gravitational, potential, energy, per, unit, volume, is, constant, throughout, the, volume, of, the, fluid, and, the, two, energy, components, change, linearly, with, the, depth, mathematically, it, is, described, by, bernoulli, s, equation, where, velocity, head, is, zero, and, comparisons, per, unit, volume, in, the, vessel, are, p, z, c, o, n, s, t, displaystyle, frac, p, gamma, z, mathrm, const, terms, have, the, same, meaning, as, in, section, fluid, pressure, an, experimentally, determined, fact, about, liquid, pressure, is, that, it, is, exerted, equally, in, all, directions, if, someone, is, submerged, in, water, no, matter, which, way, that, person, tilts, their, head, the, person, will, feel, the, same, amount, of, water, pressure, on, their, ears, because, a, liquid, can, flow, this, pressure, is, not, only, downward, pressure, is, seen, acting, sideways, when, water, spurts, sideways, from, a, leak, in, the, side, of, an, upright, can, pressure, also, acts, upward, as, demonstrated, when, someone, tries, to, push, a, beach, ball, beneath, the, surface, of, the, water, the, bottom, of, a, boat, is, pushed, upward, by, water, pressure, buoyancy, when, a, liquid, presses, against, a, surface, there, is, a, net, force, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, surface, although, pressure, does, not, have, a, specific, direction, force, does, a, submerged, triangular, block, has, water, forced, against, each, point, from, many, directions, but, components, of, the, force, that, are, not, perpendicular, to, the, surface, cancel, each, other, out, leaving, only, a, net, perpendicular, point, this, is, why, liquid, particles, velocity, only, alters, in, a, normal, component, after, they, re, collided, to, the, container, s, wall, likewise, if, the, collision, site, is, a, hole, water, spurting, from, the, hole, in, a, bucket, initially, exits, the, bucket, in, a, direction, at, right, angles, to, the, surface, of, the, bucket, in, which, the, hole, is, located, then, it, curves, downward, due, to, gravity, if, there, are, three, holes, in, a, bucket, top, bottom, and, middle, then, the, force, vectors, perpendicular, to, the, inner, container, surface, will, increase, with, increasing, depth, that, is, a, greater, pressure, at, the, bottom, makes, it, so, that, the, bottom, hole, will, shoot, water, out, the, farthest, the, force, exerted, by, a, fluid, on, a, smooth, surface, is, always, at, right, angles, to, the, surface, the, speed, of, liquid, out, of, the, hole, is, 2, g, h, displaystyle, scriptstyle, sqrt, 2gh, where, h, is, the, depth, below, the, free, surface, this, is, the, same, speed, the, water, or, anything, else, would, have, if, freely, falling, the, same, vertical, distance, h, p, p, 0, displaystyle, p, p, rho, 0, is, the, kinematic, pressure, where, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, pressure, and, 0, displaystyle, rho, 0, constant, mass, density, the, si, unit, of, p, is, m, 2, s, 2, kinematic, pressure, is, used, in, the, same, manner, as, kinematic, viscosity, displaystyle, nu, in, order, to, compute, the, navier, stokes, equation, without,
