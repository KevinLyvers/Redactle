sapphire, is, a, precious, gemstone, a, variety, of, the, mineral, corundum, consisting, of, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, with, trace, amounts, of, elements, such, as, iron, titanium, cobalt, lead, chromium, vanadium, magnesium, boron, and, silicon, the, name, sapphire, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, sapphirus, itself, from, the, greek, word, sappheiros, which, referred, to, lapis, lazuli, it, is, typically, blue, but, natural, fancy, sapphires, also, occur, in, yellow, purple, orange, and, green, colors, parti, sapphires, show, two, or, more, colors, red, corundum, stones, also, occur, but, are, called, rubies, rather, than, sapphires, pink, colored, corundum, may, be, classified, either, as, ruby, or, sapphire, depending, on, the, locale, commonly, natural, sapphires, are, cut, and, polished, into, gemstones, and, worn, in, jewelry, they, also, may, be, created, synthetically, in, laboratories, for, industrial, or, decorative, purposes, in, large, crystal, boules, because, of, the, remarkable, hardness, of, sapphires, 9, on, the, mohs, scale, the, third, hardest, mineral, after, diamond, at, 10, and, moissanite, at, 9, 5, sapphires, are, also, used, in, some, non, ornamental, applications, such, as, infrared, optical, components, high, durability, windows, wristwatch, crystals, and, movement, bearings, and, very, thin, electronic, wafers, which, are, used, as, the, insulating, substrates, of, special, purpose, solid, state, electronics, such, as, integrated, circuits, and, gan, based, blue, leds, sapphire, is, the, birthstone, for, september, and, the, gem, of, the, 45th, anniversary, a, sapphire, jubilee, occurs, after, 65, years, sapphire, is, one, of, the, two, gem, varieties, of, corundum, the, other, being, ruby, defined, as, corundum, in, a, shade, of, red, although, blue, is, the, best, known, sapphire, color, it, occurs, in, other, colors, including, gray, and, black, and, also, can, be, colorless, a, pinkish, orange, variety, of, sapphire, is, called, padparadscha, significant, sapphire, deposits, are, found, in, australia, afghanistan, cambodia, cameroon, china, shandong, colombia, ethiopia, india, jammu, and, kashmir, padder, kishtwar, kenya, laos, madagascar, malawi, mozambique, myanmar, burma, nigeria, rwanda, sri, lanka, tanzania, thailand, united, states, montana, and, vietnam, 431, 707, sapphire, and, rubies, are, often, found, in, the, same, geographical, settings, but, they, generally, have, different, geological, formations, for, example, both, ruby, and, sapphire, are, found, in, myanmar, s, mogok, stone, tract, but, the, rubies, form, in, marble, while, the, sapphire, forms, in, granitic, pegmatites, or, corundum, syenites, 403, 429, every, sapphire, mine, produces, a, wide, range, of, quality, and, origin, is, not, a, guarantee, of, quality, for, sapphire, jammu, and, kashmir, receives, the, highest, premium, although, burma, sri, lanka, and, madagascar, also, produce, large, quantities, of, fine, quality, gems, the, cost, of, natural, sapphires, varies, depending, on, their, color, clarity, size, cut, and, overall, quality, sapphires, that, are, completely, untreated, are, worth, far, more, than, those, that, have, been, treated, geographical, origin, also, has, a, major, impact, on, price, for, most, gems, of, one, carat, or, more, an, independent, report, from, a, respected, laboratory, such, as, gia, lotus, gemology, or, ssef, is, often, required, by, buyers, before, they, will, make, a, purchase, sapphires, in, colors, other, than, blue, are, called, fancy, sapphires, parti, sapphire, is, used, for, multicolor, stones, with, zoning, of, different, colors, hues, but, not, different, shades, fancy, sapphires, are, found, in, yellow, orange, green, brown, purple, violet, and, practically, any, other, hue, gemstone, color, can, be, described, in, terms, of, hue, saturation, and, tone, hue, is, commonly, understood, as, the, color, of, the, gemstone, saturation, refers, to, the, vividness, or, brightness, of, the, hue, and, tone, is, the, lightness, to, darkness, of, the, hue, 333, 401, blue, sapphire, exists, in, various, mixtures, of, its, primary, blue, and, secondary, hues, various, tonal, levels, shades, and, at, various, levels, of, saturation, vividness, blue, sapphires, are, evaluated, based, upon, the, purity, of, their, blue, hue, violet, and, green, are, the, most, common, secondary, hues, found, in, blue, sapphires, 333, 401, the, highest, prices, are, paid, for, gems, that, are, pure, blue, and, of, vivid, saturation, gems, that, are, of, lower, saturation, or, are, too, dark, or, too, light, in, tone, are, of, less, value, however, color, preferences, are, a, personal, taste, 333, 401, the, 423, carat, 84, 6, g, logan, sapphire, in, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, washington, d, c, is, one, of, the, largest, faceted, gem, quality, blue, sapphires, in, existence, particolored, sapphires, or, bi, color, sapphires, are, those, stones, that, exhibit, two, or, more, colors, within, a, single, stone, the, desirability, of, particolored, or, bi, color, sapphires, is, usually, judged, based, on, the, zoning, or, location, of, their, colors, the, colors, saturation, and, the, contrast, of, their, colors, australia, is, the, largest, source, of, particolored, sapphires, they, are, not, commonly, used, in, mainstream, jewelry, and, remain, relatively, unknown, particolored, sapphires, cannot, be, created, synthetically, and, only, occur, naturally, pink, sapphires, occur, in, shades, from, light, to, dark, pink, and, deepen, in, color, as, the, quantity, of, chromium, increases, the, deeper, the, pink, color, the, higher, their, monetary, value, in, the, united, states, a, minimum, color, saturation, must, be, met, to, be, called, a, ruby, otherwise, the, stone, is, referred, to, as, a, pink, sapphire, padparadscha, is, a, delicate, light, to, medium, toned, pink, orange, to, orange, pink, hued, corundum, originally, found, in, sri, lanka, but, also, found, in, deposits, in, vietnam, and, parts, of, east, africa, padparadscha, sapphires, are, rare, the, rarest, of, all, is, the, totally, natural, variety, with, no, sign, of, artificial, treatment, the, name, is, derived, from, the, sanskrit, padma, ranga, padma, lotus, ranga, color, a, color, akin, to, the, lotus, flower, nelumbo, nucifera, among, the, fancy, non, blue, sapphires, natural, padparadscha, fetch, the, highest, prices, since, 2001, more, sapphires, of, this, color, have, appeared, on, the, market, as, a, result, of, artificial, lattice, diffusion, of, beryllium, a, star, sapphire, is, a, type, of, sapphire, that, exhibits, a, star, like, phenomenon, known, as, asterism, red, stones, are, known, as, star, rubies, star, sapphires, contain, intersecting, needle, like, inclusions, following, the, underlying, crystal, structure, that, causes, the, appearance, of, a, six, rayed, star, shaped, pattern, when, viewed, with, a, single, overhead, light, source, the, inclusion, is, often, the, mineral, rutile, a, mineral, composed, primarily, of, titanium, dioxide, the, stones, are, cut, en, cabochon, typically, with, the, center, of, the, star, near, the, top, of, the, dome, occasionally, twelve, rayed, stars, are, found, typically, because, two, different, sets, of, inclusions, are, found, within, the, same, stone, such, as, a, combination, of, fine, needles, of, rutile, with, small, platelets, of, hematite, the, first, results, in, a, whitish, star, and, the, second, results, in, a, golden, colored, star, during, crystallization, the, two, types, of, inclusions, become, preferentially, oriented, in, different, directions, within, the, crystal, thereby, forming, two, six, rayed, stars, that, are, superimposed, upon, each, other, to, form, a, twelve, rayed, star, misshapen, stars, or, 12, rayed, stars, may, also, form, as, a, result, of, twinning, the, inclusions, can, alternatively, produce, a, cat, s, eye, effect, if, the, girdle, plane, of, the, cabochon, is, oriented, parallel, to, the, crystal, s, c, axis, rather, than, perpendicular, to, it, to, get, a, cat, s, eye, the, planes, of, exsolved, inclusions, must, be, extremely, uniform, and, tightly, packed, if, the, dome, is, oriented, in, between, these, two, directions, an, off, center, star, will, be, visible, offset, away, from, the, high, point, of, the, dome, 101, at, 1404, 49, carats, the, star, of, adam, is, the, largest, known, blue, star, sapphire, the, gem, was, mined, in, the, city, of, ratnapura, southern, sri, lanka, the, black, star, of, queensland, the, second, largest, star, sapphire, in, the, world, weighs, 733, carats, the, star, of, india, mined, in, sri, lanka, and, weighing, 563, 4, carats, is, thought, to, be, the, third, largest, star, sapphire, and, is, currently, on, display, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, new, york, city, the, 182, carat, star, of, bombay, mined, in, sri, lanka, and, located, in, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, washington, d, c, is, another, example, of, a, large, blue, star, sapphire, the, value, of, a, star, sapphire, depends, not, only, on, the, weight, of, the, stone, but, also, the, body, color, visibility, and, intensity, of, the, asterism, the, color, of, the, stone, has, more, impact, on, the, value, than, the, visibility, of, the, star, since, more, transparent, stones, tend, to, have, better, colors, the, most, expensive, star, stones, are, semi, transparent, glass, body, stones, with, vivid, colors, 348, 350, on, 28, july, 2021, the, world, s, largest, cluster, of, star, sapphires, weighing, 510, kg, 1, 120, lb, was, unearthed, from, ratnapura, sri, lanka, this, star, sapphire, cluster, was, named, serendipity, sapphire, a, rare, variety, of, natural, sapphire, known, as, color, change, sapphire, exhibits, different, colors, in, different, light, color, change, sapphires, are, blue, in, outdoor, light, and, purple, under, incandescent, indoor, light, or, green, to, gray, green, in, daylight, and, pink, to, reddish, violet, in, incandescent, light, color, change, sapphires, come, from, a, variety, of, locations, including, madagascar, myanmar, sri, lanka, and, tanzania, two, types, exist, the, first, features, the, chromium, chromophore, that, creates, the, red, color, of, ruby, combined, with, the, iron, titanium, chromophore, that, produces, the, blue, color, in, sapphire, a, rarer, type, which, comes, from, the, mogok, area, of, myanmar, features, a, vanadium, chromophore, the, same, as, is, present, in, verneuil, synthetic, color, change, sapphire, virtually, all, gemstones, that, show, the, alexandrite, effect, color, change, or, metamerism, show, similar, absorption, transmission, features, in, the, visible, spectrum, this, is, an, absorption, band, in, the, yellow, 590, nm, along, with, valleys, of, transmission, in, the, blue, green, and, red, thus, the, color, one, sees, depends, on, the, spectral, composition, of, the, light, source, daylight, is, relatively, balanced, in, its, spectral, power, distribution, spd, and, since, the, human, eye, is, most, sensitive, to, green, light, the, balance, is, tipped, to, the, green, side, however, incandescent, light, including, candle, light, is, heavily, tilted, to, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, thus, tipping, the, balance, to, red, color, change, sapphires, colored, by, the, cr, fe, ti, chromophores, generally, change, from, blue, or, violet, blue, to, violet, or, purple, those, colored, by, the, v, chromophore, can, show, a, more, pronounced, change, moving, from, blue, green, to, purple, certain, synthetic, color, change, sapphires, have, a, similar, color, change, to, the, natural, gemstone, alexandrite, and, they, are, sometimes, marketed, as, alexandrium, or, synthetic, alexandrite, however, the, latter, term, is, a, misnomer, synthetic, color, change, sapphires, are, technically, not, synthetic, alexandrites, but, rather, alexandrite, simulants, this, is, because, genuine, alexandrite, is, a, variety, of, chrysoberyl, not, sapphire, but, an, entirely, different, mineral, from, corundum, large, rubies, and, sapphires, of, poor, transparency, are, frequently, used, with, suspect, appraisals, that, vastly, overstate, their, value, this, was, the, case, of, the, life, and, pride, of, america, star, sapphire, circa, 1985, roy, whetstine, claimed, to, have, bought, the, 1905, ct, stone, for, 10, at, the, tucson, gem, show, but, a, reporter, discovered, that, l, a, ward, of, fallbrook, california, who, appraised, it, at, the, price, of, 1200, ct, had, appraised, another, stone, of, the, exact, same, weight, several, years, before, whetstine, claimed, to, have, found, it, bangkok, based, lotus, gemology, maintains, an, updated, listing, of, world, auction, records, of, ruby, sapphire, and, spinel, as, of, november, 2019, no, sapphire, has, ever, sold, at, auction, for, more, than, 17, 295, 796, rubies, are, corundum, with, a, dominant, red, body, color, this, is, generally, caused, by, traces, of, chromium, cr, 3, substituting, for, the, al, 3, ion, in, the, corundum, structure, the, color, can, be, modified, by, both, iron, and, trapped, hole, color, centers, unlike, localized, intra, atomic, absorption, of, light, which, causes, color, for, chromium, and, vanadium, impurities, blue, color, in, sapphires, comes, from, intervalence, charge, transfer, which, is, the, transfer, of, an, electron, from, one, transition, metal, ion, to, another, via, the, conduction, or, valence, band, the, iron, can, take, the, form, fe, 2, or, fe, 3, while, titanium, generally, takes, the, form, ti, 4, if, fe, 2, and, ti, 4, ions, are, substituted, for, al, 3, localized, areas, of, charge, imbalance, are, created, an, electron, transfer, from, fe, 2, and, ti, 4, can, cause, a, change, in, the, valence, state, of, both, because, of, the, valence, change, there, is, a, specific, change, in, energy, for, the, electron, and, electromagnetic, energy, is, absorbed, the, wavelength, of, the, energy, absorbed, corresponds, to, yellow, light, when, this, light, is, subtracted, from, incident, white, light, the, complementary, color, blue, results, sometimes, when, atomic, spacing, is, different, in, different, directions, there, is, resulting, blue, green, dichroism, purple, sapphires, contain, trace, amounts, of, chromium, and, iron, plus, titanium, and, come, in, a, variety, of, shades, corundum, that, contains, extremely, low, levels, of, chromophores, is, near, colorless, completely, colorless, corundum, generally, does, not, exist, in, nature, if, trace, amounts, of, iron, are, present, a, very, pale, yellow, to, green, color, may, be, seen, however, if, both, titanium, and, iron, impurities, are, present, together, and, in, the, correct, valence, states, the, result, is, a, blue, color, intervalence, charge, transfer, is, a, process, that, produces, a, strong, colored, appearance, at, a, low, percentage, of, impurity, while, at, least, 1, chromium, must, be, present, in, corundum, before, the, deep, red, ruby, color, is, seen, sapphire, blue, is, apparent, with, the, presence, of, only, 0, 01, of, titanium, and, iron, colorless, sapphires, which, are, uncommon, in, nature, were, once, used, as, diamond, substitutes, in, jewelry, and, are, presently, used, as, accent, stones, the, most, complete, description, of, the, causes, of, color, in, corundum, extant, can, be, found, in, chapter, 4, of, ruby, sapphire, a, gemologist, s, guide, chapter, authored, by, john, emmett, emily, dubinsky, and, richard, hughes, 107, 164, sapphires, are, mined, from, alluvial, deposits, or, from, primary, underground, workings, commercial, mining, locations, for, sapphire, and, ruby, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, following, countries, afghanistan, australia, myanmar, burma, cambodia, china, colombia, india, kenya, laos, madagascar, malawi, nepal, nigeria, pakistan, sri, lanka, tajikistan, tanzania, thailand, united, states, and, vietnam, sapphires, from, different, geographic, locations, may, have, different, appearances, or, chemical, impurity, concentrations, and, tend, to, contain, different, types, of, microscopic, inclusions, because, of, this, sapphires, can, be, divided, into, three, broad, categories, classic, metamorphic, non, classic, metamorphic, or, magmatic, and, classic, magmatic, sapphires, from, certain, locations, or, of, certain, categories, may, be, more, commercially, appealing, than, others, particularly, classic, metamorphic, sapphires, from, kashmir, burma, or, sri, lanka, that, have, not, been, subjected, to, heat, treatment, the, logan, sapphire, the, star, of, india, the, star, of, adam, and, the, star, of, bombay, originate, from, sri, lankan, mines, madagascar, is, the, world, leader, in, sapphire, production, as, of, 2007, specifically, its, deposits, in, and, around, the, town, of, ilakaka, prior, to, the, opening, of, the, ilakaka, mines, australia, was, the, largest, producer, of, sapphires, such, as, in, 1987, in, 1991, a, new, source, of, sapphires, was, discovered, in, andranondambo, southern, madagascar, the, exploitation, started, in, 1993, but, was, practically, abandoned, just, a, few, years, later, because, of, the, difficulties, in, recovering, sapphires, in, their, bedrock, in, north, america, sapphires, have, been, mined, mostly, from, deposits, in, montana, facies, along, the, missouri, river, near, helena, montana, dry, cottonwood, creek, near, deer, lodge, montana, and, rock, creek, near, philipsburg, montana, fine, blue, yogo, sapphires, are, found, at, yogo, gulch, west, of, lewistown, montana, a, few, gem, grade, sapphires, and, rubies, have, also, been, found, in, the, area, of, franklin, north, carolina, the, sapphire, deposits, of, kashmir, are, well, known, in, the, gem, industry, although, their, peak, production, took, place, in, a, relatively, short, period, at, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, 463, 482, these, deposits, are, located, in, the, paddar, valley, of, the, jammu, region, of, jammu, and, kashmir, in, india, they, have, a, superior, vivid, blue, hue, coupled, with, a, mysterious, and, almost, sleepy, quality, described, by, some, gem, enthusiasts, as, blue, velvet, kashmir, origin, contributes, meaningfully, to, the, value, of, a, sapphire, and, most, corundum, of, kashmir, origin, can, be, readily, identified, by, its, characteristic, silky, appearance, and, exceptional, hue, the, unique, blue, appears, lustrous, under, any, kind, of, light, unlike, non, kashmir, sapphires, which, may, appear, purplish, or, grayish, in, comparison, sotheby, s, has, been, in, the, forefront, overseeing, record, breaking, sales, of, kashmir, sapphires, worldwide, in, october, 2014, sotheby, s, hong, kong, achieved, consecutive, per, carat, price, records, for, kashmir, sapphires, first, with, the, 12, 00, carat, cartier, sapphire, ring, at, us, 193, 975, per, carat, then, with, a, 17, 16, carat, sapphire, at, us, 236, 404, and, again, in, june, 2015, when, the, per, carat, auction, record, was, set, at, us, 240, 205, at, present, the, world, record, price, per, carat, for, sapphire, at, auction, is, held, by, a, sapphire, from, kashmir, in, a, ring, which, sold, in, october, 2015, for, approximately, us, 242, 000, per, carat, hk, 52, 280, 000, in, total, including, buyer, s, premium, or, more, than, us, 6, 74, million, sapphires, can, be, treated, by, several, methods, to, enhance, and, improve, their, clarity, and, color, 197, 247, it, is, common, practice, to, heat, natural, sapphires, to, improve, or, enhance, their, appearance, this, is, done, by, heating, the, sapphires, in, furnaces, to, temperatures, between, 800, and, 1, 800, c, 1, 470, and, 3, 270, f, for, several, hours, or, even, weeks, at, a, time, different, atmospheres, may, be, used, upon, heating, the, stone, becomes, bluer, in, color, but, loses, some, of, the, rutile, inclusions, silk, when, high, temperatures, 1400, c, are, used, exsolved, rutile, silk, is, dissolved, and, it, becomes, clear, under, magnification, the, titanium, from, the, rutile, enters, solid, solution, and, thus, creates, with, iron, the, blue, color, the, inclusions, in, natural, stones, are, easily, seen, with, a, jeweler, s, loupe, evidence, of, sapphire, and, other, gemstones, being, subjected, to, heating, goes, back, at, least, to, roman, times, un, heated, natural, stones, are, somewhat, rare, and, will, often, be, sold, accompanied, by, a, certificate, from, an, independent, gemological, laboratory, attesting, to, no, evidence, of, heat, treatment, yogo, sapphires, do, not, need, heat, treating, because, their, cornflower, blue, color, is, attractive, out, of, the, ground, they, are, generally, free, of, inclusions, and, have, high, uniform, clarity, when, intergem, limited, began, marketing, the, yogo, in, the, 1980s, as, the, world, s, only, guaranteed, untreated, sapphire, heat, treatment, was, not, commonly, disclosed, by, the, late, 1980s, heat, treatment, became, a, major, issue, at, that, time, much, of, all, the, world, s, sapphires, were, being, heated, to, enhance, their, natural, color, intergem, s, marketing, of, guaranteed, untreated, yogos, set, them, against, many, in, the, gem, industry, this, issue, appeared, as, a, front, page, story, in, the, wall, street, journal, on, 29, august, 1984, in, an, article, by, bill, richards, carats, and, schticks, sapphire, marketer, upsets, the, gem, industry, however, the, biggest, problem, the, yogo, mine, faced, was, not, competition, from, heated, sapphires, but, the, fact, that, the, yogo, stones, could, never, produce, quantities, of, sapphire, above, one, carat, after, faceting, as, a, result, it, has, remained, a, niche, product, with, a, market, that, largely, exists, in, the, us, 676, 695, lattice, bulk, diffusion, treatments, are, used, to, add, impurities, to, the, sapphire, to, enhance, color, this, process, was, originally, developed, and, patented, by, linde, air, division, of, union, carbide, and, involved, diffusing, titanium, into, synthetic, sapphire, to, even, out, the, blue, color, it, was, later, applied, to, natural, sapphire, today, titanium, diffusion, often, uses, a, synthetic, colorless, sapphire, base, the, color, layer, created, by, titanium, diffusion, is, extremely, thin, less, than, 0, 5, mm, thus, repolishing, can, and, does, produce, slight, to, significant, loss, of, color, chromium, diffusion, has, been, attempted, but, was, abandoned, due, to, the, slow, diffusion, rates, of, chromium, in, corundum, in, the, year, 2000, beryllium, diffused, padparadscha, colored, sapphires, entered, the, market, typically, beryllium, is, diffused, into, a, sapphire, under, very, high, heat, just, below, the, melting, point, of, the, sapphire, initially, c, 2000, orange, sapphires, were, created, although, now, the, process, has, been, advanced, and, many, colors, of, sapphire, are, often, treated, with, beryllium, due, to, the, small, size, of, the, beryllium, ion, the, color, penetration, is, far, greater, than, with, titanium, diffusion, in, some, cases, it, may, penetrate, the, entire, stone, beryllium, diffused, orange, sapphires, may, be, difficult, to, detect, requiring, advanced, chemical, analysis, by, gemological, labs, e, g, g, belin, ssef, gia, american, gemological, laboratories, agl, lotus, gemology, according, to, united, states, federal, trade, commission, guidelines, disclosure, is, required, of, any, mode, of, enhancement, that, has, a, significant, effect, on, the, gem, s, value, there, are, several, ways, of, treating, sapphire, heat, treatment, in, a, reducing, or, oxidizing, atmosphere, but, without, the, use, of, any, other, added, impurities, is, commonly, used, to, improve, the, color, of, sapphires, and, this, process, is, sometimes, known, as, heating, only, in, the, gem, trade, in, contrast, however, heat, treatment, combined, with, the, deliberate, addition, of, certain, specific, impurities, e, g, beryllium, titanium, iron, chromium, or, nickel, which, are, absorbed, into, the, crystal, structure, of, the, sapphire, is, also, commonly, performed, and, this, process, can, be, known, as, diffusion, in, the, gem, trade, however, despite, what, the, terms, heating, only, and, diffusion, might, suggest, both, of, these, categories, of, treatment, actually, involve, diffusion, processes, the, most, complete, description, of, corundum, treatments, extant, can, be, found, in, chapter, 6, of, ruby, sapphire, a, gemologist, s, guide, chapter, authored, by, john, emmett, richard, hughes, and, troy, r, douthit, 197, 247, in, 1902, the, french, chemist, auguste, verneuil, announced, a, process, for, producing, synthetic, ruby, crystals, in, the, flame, fusion, verneuil, process, fine, alumina, powder, is, added, to, an, oxyhydrogen, flame, and, this, is, directed, downward, against, a, ceramic, pedestal, following, the, successful, synthesis, of, ruby, verneuil, focused, his, efforts, on, sapphire, synthesis, of, blue, sapphire, came, in, 1909, after, chemical, analyses, of, sapphire, suggested, to, verneuil, that, iron, and, titanium, were, the, cause, of, the, blue, color, verneuil, patented, the, process, of, producing, synthetic, blue, sapphire, in, 1911, 254, 255, the, key, to, the, process, is, that, the, alumina, powder, does, not, melt, as, it, falls, through, the, flame, instead, it, forms, a, sinter, cone, on, the, pedestal, when, the, tip, of, that, cone, reaches, the, hottest, part, of, the, flame, the, tip, melts, thus, the, crystal, growth, is, started, from, a, tiny, point, ensuring, minimal, strain, next, more, oxygen, is, added, to, the, flame, causing, it, to, burn, slightly, hotter, this, expands, the, growing, crystal, laterally, at, the, same, time, the, pedestal, is, lowered, at, the, same, rate, that, the, crystal, grows, vertically, the, alumina, in, the, flame, is, slowly, deposited, creating, a, teardrop, shaped, boule, of, sapphire, material, this, step, is, continued, until, the, desired, size, is, reached, the, flame, is, shut, off, and, the, crystal, cools, the, now, elongated, crystal, contains, a, lot, of, strain, due, to, the, high, thermal, gradient, between, the, flame, and, surrounding, air, to, release, this, strain, the, now, finger, shaped, crystal, will, be, tapped, with, a, chisel, to, split, it, into, two, halves, 249, 309, due, to, the, vertical, layered, growth, of, the, crystal, and, the, curved, upper, growth, surface, which, starts, from, a, drop, the, crystals, will, display, curved, growth, lines, following, the, top, surface, of, the, boule, this, is, in, contrast, to, natural, corundum, crystals, which, feature, angular, growth, lines, expanding, from, a, single, point, and, following, the, planar, crystal, faces, chemical, dopants, can, be, added, to, create, artificial, versions, of, the, ruby, and, all, the, other, natural, colors, of, sapphire, and, in, addition, other, colors, never, seen, in, geological, samples, artificial, sapphire, material, is, identical, to, natural, sapphire, except, it, can, be, made, without, the, flaws, that, are, found, in, natural, stones, the, disadvantage, of, the, verneuil, process, is, that, the, grown, crystals, have, high, internal, strains, many, methods, of, manufacturing, sapphire, today, are, variations, of, the, czochralski, process, which, was, invented, in, 1916, by, polish, chemist, jan, czochralski, in, this, process, a, tiny, sapphire, seed, crystal, is, dipped, into, a, crucible, made, of, the, precious, metal, iridium, or, molybdenum, containing, molten, alumina, and, then, slowly, withdrawn, upward, at, a, rate, of, 1, to, 100, mm, per, hour, the, alumina, crystallizes, on, the, end, creating, long, carrot, shaped, boules, of, large, size, up, to, 200, kg, in, mass, synthetic, sapphire, is, also, produced, industrially, from, agglomerated, aluminum, oxide, sintered, and, fused, such, as, by, hot, isostatic, pressing, in, an, inert, atmosphere, yielding, a, transparent, but, slightly, porous, polycrystalline, product, in, 2003, the, world, s, production, of, synthetic, sapphire, was, 250, tons, 1, 25, 10, 9, carats, mostly, by, the, united, states, and, russia, the, availability, of, cheap, synthetic, sapphire, unlocked, many, industrial, uses, for, this, unique, material, synthetic, sapphire, also, referred, to, as, sapphire, glass, is, commonly, used, for, small, windows, because, it, is, both, highly, transparent, to, wavelengths, of, light, between, 150, nm, uv, and, 5500, nm, ir, the, visible, spectrum, extends, about, 380, nm, to, 750, nm, and, extraordinarily, scratch, resistant, the, key, benefits, of, sapphire, windows, are, some, sapphire, glass, windows, are, made, from, pure, sapphire, boules, that, have, been, grown, in, a, specific, crystal, orientation, typically, along, the, optical, axis, the, c, axis, for, minimum, birefringence, for, the, application, the, boules, are, sliced, up, into, the, desired, window, thickness, and, finally, polished, to, the, desired, surface, finish, sapphire, optical, windows, can, be, polished, to, a, wide, range, of, surface, finishes, due, to, its, crystal, structure, and, its, hardness, the, surface, finishes, of, optical, windows, are, normally, called, out, by, the, scratch, dig, specifications, in, accordance, with, the, globally, adopted, mil, o, 13830, specification, sapphire, windows, are, used, in, both, high, pressure, and, vacuum, chambers, for, spectroscopy, crystals, for, watches, and, windows, in, grocery, store, barcode, scanners, since, the, material, s, exceptional, hardness, and, toughness, makes, it, very, resistant, to, scratching, in, 2014, apple, consumed, one, fourth, of, the, world, s, supply, of, sapphire, to, cover, the, iphone, s, camera, lens, and, fingerprint, reader, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, make, sapphire, screens, for, smartphones, viable, apple, contracted, gt, advanced, technologies, inc, to, manufacture, sapphire, screens, for, iphones, but, the, venture, failed, causing, the, bankruptcy, of, gtat, the, kyocera, brigadier, was, the, first, production, smartphone, with, a, sapphire, screen, sapphire, is, used, for, end, windows, on, some, high, powered, laser, tubes, as, its, wide, band, transparency, and, thermal, conductivity, allow, it, to, handle, very, high, power, densities, in, the, infrared, and, uv, spectrum, without, degrading, due, to, heating, one, type, of, xenon, arc, lamp, originally, called, the, cermax, and, now, known, generically, as, the, ceramic, body, xenon, lamp, uses, sapphire, crystal, output, windows, that, tolerate, higher, thermal, loads, and, consequently, can, provide, higher, output, powers, than, conventional, xe, lamps, with, pure, silica, windows, sapphire, window, was, used, for, the, f, 35, lightning, 2, electro, optical, targeting, system, window, due, to, its, high, strength, along, with, zirconia, and, aluminum, oxynitride, synthetic, sapphire, is, used, for, shatter, resistant, windows, in, armored, vehicles, and, various, military, body, armor, suits, in, association, with, composites, thin, sapphire, wafers, were, the, first, successful, use, of, an, insulating, substrate, upon, which, to, deposit, silicon, to, make, the, integrated, circuits, known, as, silicon, on, sapphire, or, sos, now, other, substrates, can, also, be, used, for, the, class, of, circuits, known, more, generally, as, silicon, on, insulator, besides, its, excellent, electrical, insulating, properties, sapphire, has, high, thermal, conductivity, cmos, chips, on, sapphire, are, especially, useful, for, high, power, radio, frequency, rf, applications, such, as, those, found, in, cellular, telephones, public, safety, band, radios, and, satellite, communication, systems, sos, also, allows, for, the, monolithic, integration, of, both, digital, and, analog, circuitry, all, on, one, ic, chip, and, the, construction, of, extremely, low, power, circuits, in, one, process, after, single, crystal, sapphire, boules, are, grown, they, are, core, drilled, into, cylindrical, rods, and, wafers, are, then, sliced, from, these, cores, wafers, of, single, crystal, sapphire, are, also, used, in, the, semiconductor, industry, as, substrates, for, the, growth, of, devices, based, on, gallium, nitride, gan, the, use, of, sapphire, significantly, reduces, the, cost, because, it, has, about, one, seventh, the, cost, of, germanium, gallium, nitride, on, sapphire, is, commonly, used, in, blue, light, emitting, diodes, leds, the, first, laser, was, made, in, 1960, by, theodore, maiman, with, a, rod, of, synthetic, ruby, titanium, sapphire, lasers, are, popular, due, to, their, relatively, rare, capacity, to, be, tuned, to, various, wavelengths, in, the, red, and, near, infrared, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, they, can, also, be, easily, mode, locked, in, these, lasers, a, synthetically, produced, sapphire, crystal, with, chromium, or, titanium, impurities, is, irradiated, with, intense, light, from, a, special, lamp, or, another, laser, to, create, stimulated, emission, monocrystalline, sapphire, is, fairly, biocompatible, and, the, exceptionally, low, wear, of, sapphire, metal, pairs, has, led, to, the, introduction, in, ukraine, of, sapphire, monocrystals, for, hip, joint, endoprostheses, extensive, tables, listing, over, a, hundred, important, and, famous, rubies, and, sapphires, can, be, found, in, chapter, 10, of, ruby, sapphire, a,
