rhodium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, rh, and, atomic, number, 45, it, is, a, very, rare, silvery, white, hard, corrosion, resistant, transition, metal, it, is, a, noble, metal, and, a, member, of, the, platinum, group, it, has, only, one, naturally, occurring, isotope, which, is, 103, rh, naturally, occurring, rhodium, is, usually, found, as, a, free, metal, or, as, an, alloy, with, similar, metals, and, rarely, as, a, chemical, compound, in, minerals, such, as, bowieite, and, rhodplumsite, it, is, one, of, the, rarest, and, most, valuable, precious, metals, rhodium, is, a, group, 9, element, cobalt, group, rhodium, is, found, in, platinum, or, nickel, ores, with, the, other, members, of, the, platinum, group, metals, it, was, discovered, in, 1803, by, william, hyde, wollaston, in, one, such, ore, and, named, for, the, rose, color, of, one, of, its, chlorine, compounds, the, element, s, major, use, consuming, about, 80, of, world, rhodium, production, is, as, one, of, the, catalysts, in, the, three, way, catalytic, converters, in, automobiles, because, rhodium, metal, is, inert, against, corrosion, and, most, aggressive, chemicals, and, because, of, its, rarity, rhodium, is, usually, alloyed, with, platinum, or, palladium, and, applied, in, high, temperature, and, corrosion, resistive, coatings, white, gold, is, often, plated, with, a, thin, rhodium, layer, to, improve, its, appearance, while, sterling, silver, is, often, rhodium, plated, to, resist, tarnishing, rhodium, is, sometimes, used, to, cure, silicones, a, two, part, silicone, in, which, one, part, containing, a, silicon, hydride, and, the, other, containing, a, vinyl, terminated, silicone, are, mixed, one, of, these, liquids, contains, a, rhodium, complex, rhodium, detectors, are, used, in, nuclear, reactors, to, measure, the, neutron, flux, level, other, uses, of, rhodium, include, asymmetric, hydrogenation, used, to, form, drug, precursors, and, the, processes, for, the, production, of, acetic, acid, rhodium, greek, rhodon, meaning, rose, was, discovered, in, 1803, by, william, hyde, wollaston, soon, after, he, discovered, palladium, he, used, crude, platinum, ore, presumably, obtained, from, south, america, his, procedure, dissolved, the, ore, in, aqua, regia, and, neutralized, the, acid, with, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, he, then, precipitated, the, platinum, as, ammonium, chloroplatinate, by, adding, ammonium, chloride, nh, 4, cl, most, other, metals, like, copper, lead, palladium, and, rhodium, were, precipitated, with, zinc, diluted, nitric, acid, dissolved, all, but, palladium, and, rhodium, of, these, palladium, dissolved, in, aqua, regia, but, rhodium, did, not, and, the, rhodium, was, precipitated, by, the, addition, of, sodium, chloride, as, na, 3, n, h, 2, o, after, being, washed, with, ethanol, the, rose, red, precipitate, was, reacted, with, zinc, which, displaced, the, rhodium, in, the, ionic, compound, and, thereby, released, the, rhodium, as, free, metal, for, decades, the, rare, element, had, only, minor, applications, for, example, by, the, turn, of, the, century, rhodium, containing, thermocouples, were, used, to, measure, temperatures, up, to, 1800, c, they, have, exceptionally, good, stability, in, the, temperature, range, of, 1300, to, 1800, c, the, first, major, application, was, electroplating, for, decorative, uses, and, as, corrosion, resistant, coating, the, introduction, of, the, three, way, catalytic, converter, by, volvo, in, 1976, increased, the, demand, for, rhodium, the, previous, catalytic, converters, used, platinum, or, palladium, while, the, three, way, catalytic, converter, used, rhodium, to, reduce, the, amount, of, no, x, in, the, exhaust, rhodium, is, a, hard, silvery, durable, metal, that, has, a, high, reflectance, rhodium, metal, does, not, normally, form, an, oxide, even, when, heated, oxygen, is, absorbed, from, the, atmosphere, only, at, the, melting, point, of, rhodium, but, is, released, on, solidification, rhodium, has, both, a, higher, melting, point, and, lower, density, than, platinum, it, is, not, attacked, by, most, acids, it, is, completely, insoluble, in, nitric, acid, and, dissolves, slightly, in, aqua, regia, rhodium, belongs, to, group, 9, of, the, periodic, table, but, exhibits, an, atypical, ground, state, valence, electron, configuration, for, that, group, like, neighboring, elements, niobium, 41, ruthenium, 44, and, palladium, 46, it, only, has, one, electron, in, its, outermost, s, orbital, the, common, oxidation, state, of, rhodium, is, 3, but, oxidation, states, from, 0, to, 7, are, also, observed, unlike, ruthenium, and, osmium, rhodium, forms, no, volatile, oxygen, compounds, the, known, stable, oxides, include, rh, 2, o, 3, rho, 2, rho, 2, x, h, 2, o, na, 2, rho, 3, sr, 3, lirho, 6, and, sr, 3, narho, 6, halogen, compounds, are, known, in, nearly, the, full, range, of, possible, oxidation, states, rhodium, iii, chloride, rhodium, trifluoride, rhodium, pentafluoride, and, rhodium, hexafluoride, are, examples, the, lower, oxidation, states, are, stable, only, in, the, presence, of, ligands, the, best, known, rhodium, halogen, compound, is, the, wilkinson, s, catalyst, chlorotris, triphenylphosphine, rhodium, i, this, catalyst, is, used, in, the, hydroformylation, or, hydrogenation, of, alkenes, naturally, occurring, rhodium, is, composed, of, only, one, isotope, 103, rh, the, most, stable, radioisotopes, are, 101, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 3, years, 102, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 207, days, 102m, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 9, years, and, 99, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 16, 1, days, twenty, other, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, atomic, weights, ranging, from, 92, 926, u, 93, rh, to, 116, 925, u, 117, rh, most, of, these, have, half, lives, shorter, than, an, hour, except, 100, rh, 20, 8, hours, and, 105, rh, 35, 36, hours, rhodium, has, numerous, meta, states, the, most, stable, being, 102m, rh, 0, 141, mev, with, a, half, life, of, about, 2, 9, years, and, 101m, rh, 0, 157, mev, with, a, half, life, of, 4, 34, days, see, isotopes, of, rhodium, in, isotopes, weighing, less, than, 103, the, stable, isotope, the, primary, decay, mode, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, decay, product, is, ruthenium, in, isotopes, greater, than, 103, the, primary, decay, mode, is, beta, emission, and, the, primary, product, is, palladium, rhodium, is, one, of, the, rarest, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, comprising, an, estimated, 0, 0002, parts, per, million, 2, 10, 10, its, rarity, affects, its, price, and, its, use, in, commercial, applications, the, concentration, of, rhodium, in, nickel, meteorites, is, typically, 1, part, per, billion, rhodium, has, been, measured, in, some, potatoes, with, concentrations, between, 0, 8, and, 30, ppt, the, industrial, extraction, of, rhodium, is, complex, because, the, ores, are, mixed, with, other, metals, such, as, palladium, silver, platinum, and, gold, and, there, are, very, few, rhodium, bearing, minerals, it, is, found, in, platinum, ores, and, extracted, as, a, white, inert, metal, that, is, difficult, to, fuse, principal, sources, are, located, in, south, africa, in, river, sands, of, the, ural, mountains, in, russia, and, in, north, america, including, the, copper, nickel, sulfide, mining, area, of, the, sudbury, ontario, region, although, the, rhodium, abundance, at, sudbury, is, very, small, the, large, amount, of, processed, nickel, ore, makes, rhodium, recovery, cost, effective, the, main, exporter, of, rhodium, is, south, africa, approximately, 80, in, 2010, followed, by, russia, the, annual, world, production, is, 30, tonnes, the, price, of, rhodium, is, highly, variable, rhodium, is, a, fission, product, of, uranium, 235, each, kilogram, of, fission, product, contains, a, significant, amount, of, the, lighter, platinum, group, metals, used, nuclear, fuel, is, therefore, a, potential, source, of, rhodium, but, the, extraction, is, complex, and, expensive, and, the, presence, of, rhodium, radioisotopes, requires, a, period, of, cooling, storage, for, multiple, half, lives, of, the, longest, lived, isotope, 101, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 3, years, and, 102m, rh, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 9, years, or, about, 10, years, these, factors, make, the, source, unattractive, and, no, large, scale, extraction, has, been, attempted, the, primary, use, of, this, element, is, in, automobiles, as, a, catalytic, converter, changing, harmful, unburned, hydrocarbons, carbon, monoxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, exhaust, emissions, into, less, noxious, gases, of, 30, 000, kg, of, rhodium, consumed, worldwide, in, 2012, 81, 24, 300, kg, went, into, this, application, and, 8, 060, kg, was, recovered, from, old, converters, about, 964, kg, of, rhodium, was, used, in, the, glass, industry, mostly, for, production, of,
