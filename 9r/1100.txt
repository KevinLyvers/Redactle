the, superposition, principle, also, known, as, superposition, property, states, that, for, all, linear, systems, the, net, response, caused, by, two, or, more, stimuli, is, the, sum, of, the, responses, that, would, have, been, caused, by, each, stimulus, individually, so, that, if, input, a, produces, response, x, and, input, b, produces, response, y, then, input, a, b, produces, response, x, y, a, function, f, x, displaystyle, f, x, that, satisfies, the, superposition, principle, is, called, a, linear, function, superposition, can, be, defined, by, two, simpler, properties, additivity, f, x, 1, x, 2, f, x, 1, f, x, 2, displaystyle, f, x, 1, x, 2, f, x, 1, f, x, 2, and, homogeneity, f, a, x, a, f, x, displaystyle, f, ax, af, x, for, scalar, a, this, principle, has, many, applications, in, physics, and, engineering, because, many, physical, systems, can, be, modeled, as, linear, systems, for, example, a, beam, can, be, modeled, as, a, linear, system, where, the, input, stimulus, is, the, load, on, the, beam, and, the, output, response, is, the, deflection, of, the, beam, the, importance, of, linear, systems, is, that, they, are, easier, to, analyze, mathematically, there, is, a, large, body, of, mathematical, techniques, frequency, domain, linear, transform, methods, such, as, fourier, and, laplace, transforms, and, linear, operator, theory, that, are, applicable, because, physical, systems, are, generally, only, approximately, linear, the, superposition, principle, is, only, an, approximation, of, the, true, physical, behavior, the, superposition, principle, applies, to, any, linear, system, including, algebraic, equations, linear, differential, equations, and, systems, of, equations, of, those, forms, the, stimuli, and, responses, could, be, numbers, functions, vectors, vector, fields, time, varying, signals, or, any, other, object, that, satisfies, certain, axioms, note, that, when, vectors, or, vector, fields, are, involved, a, superposition, is, interpreted, as, a, vector, sum, if, the, superposition, holds, then, it, automatically, also, holds, for, all, linear, operations, applied, on, these, functions, due, to, definition, such, as, gradients, differentials, or, integrals, if, they, exist, by, writing, a, very, general, stimulus, in, a, linear, system, as, the, superposition, of, stimuli, of, a, specific, and, simple, form, often, the, response, becomes, easier, to, compute, for, example, in, fourier, analysis, the, stimulus, is, written, as, the, superposition, of, infinitely, many, sinusoids, due, to, the, superposition, principle, each, of, these, sinusoids, can, be, analyzed, separately, and, its, individual, response, can, be, computed, the, response, is, itself, a, sinusoid, with, the, same, frequency, as, the, stimulus, but, generally, a, different, amplitude, and, phase, according, to, the, superposition, principle, the, response, to, the, original, stimulus, is, the, sum, or, integral, of, all, the, individual, sinusoidal, responses, as, another, common, example, in, green, s, function, analysis, the, stimulus, is, written, as, the, superposition, of, infinitely, many, impulse, functions, and, the, response, is, then, a, superposition, of, impulse, responses, fourier, analysis, is, particularly, common, for, waves, for, example, in, electromagnetic, theory, ordinary, light, is, described, as, a, superposition, of, plane, waves, waves, of, fixed, frequency, polarization, and, direction, as, long, as, the, superposition, principle, holds, which, is, often, but, not, always, see, nonlinear, optics, the, behavior, of, any, light, wave, can, be, understood, as, a, superposition, of, the, behavior, of, these, simpler, plane, waves, waves, are, usually, described, by, variations, in, some, parameters, through, space, and, time, for, example, height, in, a, water, wave, pressure, in, a, sound, wave, or, the, electromagnetic, field, in, a, light, wave, the, value, of, this, parameter, is, called, the, amplitude, of, the, wave, and, the, wave, itself, is, a, function, specifying, the, amplitude, at, each, point, in, any, system, with, waves, the, waveform, at, a, given, time, is, a, function, of, the, sources, i, e, external, forces, if, any, that, create, or, affect, the, wave, and, initial, conditions, of, the, system, in, many, cases, for, example, in, the, classic, wave, equation, the, equation, describing, the, wave, is, linear, when, this, is, true, the, superposition, principle, can, be, applied, that, means, that, the, net, amplitude, caused, by, two, or, more, waves, traversing, the, same, space, is, the, sum, of, the, amplitudes, that, would, have, been, produced, by, the, individual, waves, separately, for, example, two, waves, traveling, towards, each, other, will, pass, right, through, each, other, without, any, distortion, on, the, other, side, see, image, at, the, top, with, regard, to, wave, superposition, richard, feynman, wrote, no, one, has, ever, been, able, to, define, the, difference, between, interference, and, diffraction, satisfactorily, it, is, just, a, question, of, usage, and, there, is, no, specific, important, physical, difference, between, them, the, best, we, can, do, roughly, speaking, is, to, say, that, when, there, are, only, a, few, sources, say, two, interfering, then, the, result, is, usually, called, interference, but, if, there, is, a, large, number, of, them, it, seems, that, the, word, diffraction, is, more, often, used, other, authors, elaborate, the, difference, is, one, of, convenience, and, convention, if, the, waves, to, be, superposed, originate, from, a, few, coherent, sources, say, two, the, effect, is, called, interference, on, the, other, hand, if, the, waves, to, be, superposed, originate, by, subdividing, a, wavefront, into, infinitesimal, coherent, wavelets, sources, the, effect, is, called, diffraction, that, is, the, difference, between, the, two, phenomena, is, of, degree, only, and, basically, they, are, two, limiting, cases, of, superposition, effects, yet, another, source, concurs, in, as, much, as, the, interference, fringes, observed, by, young, were, the, diffraction, pattern, of, the, double, slit, this, chapter, is, therefore, a, continuation, of, chapter, 8, on, the, other, hand, few, opticians, would, regard, the, michelson, interferometer, as, an, example, of, diffraction, some, of, the, important, categories, of, diffraction, relate, to, the, interference, that, accompanies, division, of, the, wavefront, so, feynman, s, observation, to, some, extent, reflects, the, difficulty, that, we, may, have, in, distinguishing, division, of, amplitude, and, division, of, wavefront, the, phenomenon, of, interference, between, waves, is, based, on, this, idea, when, two, or, more, waves, traverse, the, same, space, the, net, amplitude, at, each, point, is, the, sum, of, the, amplitudes, of, the, individual, waves, in, some, cases, such, as, in, noise, canceling, headphones, the, summed, variation, has, a, smaller, amplitude, than, the, component, variations, this, is, called, destructive, interference, in, other, cases, such, as, in, a, line, array, the, summed, variation, will, have, a, bigger, amplitude, than, any, of, the, components, individually, this, is, called, constructive, interference, in, most, realistic, physical, situations, the, equation, governing, the, wave, is, only, approximately, linear, in, these, situations, the, superposition, principle, only, approximately, holds, as, a, rule, the, accuracy, of, the, approximation, tends, to, improve, as, the, amplitude, of, the, wave, gets, smaller, for, examples, of, phenomena, that, arise, when, the, superposition, principle, does, not, exactly, hold, see, the, articles, nonlinear, optics, and, nonlinear, acoustics, in, quantum, mechanics, a, principal, task, is, to, compute, how, a, certain, type, of, wave, propagates, and, behaves, the, wave, is, described, by, a, wave, function, and, the, equation, governing, its, behavior, is, called, the, schr, dinger, equation, a, primary, approach, to, computing, the, behavior, of, a, wave, function, is, to, write, it, as, a, superposition, called, quantum, superposition, of, possibly, infinitely, many, other, wave, functions, of, a, certain, type, stationary, states, whose, behavior, is, particularly, simple, since, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, linear, the, behavior, of, the, original, wave, function, can, be, computed, through, the, superposition, principle, this, way, the, projective, nature, of, quantum, mechanical, state, space, causes, some, confusion, because, a, quantum, mechanical, state, is, a, ray, in, projective, hilbert, space, not, a, vector, according, to, dirac, if, the, ket, vector, corresponding, to, a, state, is, multiplied, by, any, complex, number, not, zero, the, resulting, ket, vector, will, correspond, to, the, same, state, however, the, sum, of, two, rays, to, compose, a, superpositioned, ray, is, undefined, as, a, result, dirac, himself, uses, ket, vector, representations, of, states, to, decompose, or, split, for, example, a, ket, vector, i, displaystyle, psi, i, rangle, into, superposition, of, component, ket, vectors, j, displaystyle, phi, j, rangle, as, i, j, c, j, j, displaystyle, psi, i, rangle, sum, j, c, j, phi, j, rangle, where, the, c, j, c, displaystyle, c, j, in, textbf, c, the, equivalence, class, of, the, i, displaystyle, psi, i, rangle, allows, a, well, defined, meaning, to, be, given, to, the, relative, phases, of, the, c, j, displaystyle, c, j, but, an, absolute, same, amount, for, all, the, c, j, displaystyle, c, j, phase, change, on, the, c, j, displaystyle, c, j, does, not, affect, the, equivalence, class, of, the, i, displaystyle, psi, i, rangle, there, are, exact, correspondences, between, the, superposition, presented, in, the, main, on, this, page, and, the, quantum, superposition, for, example, the, bloch, sphere, to, represent, pure, state, of, a, two, level, quantum, mechanical, system, qubit, is, also, known, as, the, poincar, sphere, representing, different, types, of, classical, pure, polarization, states, nevertheless, on, the, topic, of, quantum, superposition, kramers, writes, the, principle, of, superposition, has, no, analogy, in, classical, physics, according, to, dirac, the, superposition, that, occurs, in, quantum, mechanics, is, of, an, essentially, different, nature, from, any, occurring, in, the, classical, theory, though, reasoning, by, dirac, includes, atomicity, of, observation, which, is, valid, as, for, phase, they, actually, mean, phase, translation, symmetry, derived, from, time, translation, symmetry, which, is, also, applicable, to, classical, states, as, shown, above, with, classical, polarization, states, a, common, type, of, boundary, value, problem, is, to, put, it, abstractly, finding, a, function, y, that, satisfies, some, equation, f, y, 0, displaystyle, f, y, 0, with, some, boundary, specification, g, y, z, displaystyle, g, y, z, for, example, in, laplace, s, equation, with, dirichlet, boundary, conditions, f, would, be, the, laplacian, operator, in, a, region, r, g, would, be, an, operator, that, restricts, y, to, the, boundary, of, r, and, z, would, be, the, function, that, y, is, required, to, equal, on, the, boundary, of, r, in, the, case, that, f, and, g, are, both, linear, operators, then, the, superposition, principle, says, that, a, superposition, of, solutions, to, the, first, equation, is, another, solution, to, the, first, equation, f, y, 1, f, y, 2, 0, f, y, 1, y, 2, 0, displaystyle, f, y, 1, f, y, 2, cdots, 0, quad, rightarrow, quad, f, y, 1, y, 2, cdots, 0, while, the, boundary, values, superpose, g, y, 1, g, y, 2, g, y, 1, y, 2, displaystyle, g, y, 1, g, y, 2, g, y, 1, y, 2, using, these, facts, if, a, list, can, be, compiled, of, solutions, to, the, first, equation, then, these, solutions, can, be, carefully, put, into, a, superposition, such, that, it, will, satisfy, the, second, equation, this, is, one, common, method, of, approaching, boundary, value, problems, consider, a, simple, linear, system, x, a, x, b, u, 1, u, 2, x, 0, x, 0, displaystyle, dot, x, ax, b, u, 1, u, 2, qquad, x, 0, x, 0, by, superposition, principle, the, system, can, be, decomposed, into, x, 1, a, x, 1, b, u, 1, x, 1, 0, x, 0, x, 2, a, x, 2, b, u, 2, x, 2, 0, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, dot, x, 1, ax, 1, bu, 1, x, 1, 0, x, 0, dot, x, 2, ax, 2, bu, 2, x, 2, 0, 0, end, aligned, with, x, x, 1, x, 2, displaystyle, x, x, 1, x, 2, superposition, principle, is, only, available, for, linear, systems, however, the, additive, state, decomposition, can, be, applied, to, both, linear, and, nonlinear, systems, next, consider, a, nonlinear, system, x, a, x, b, u, 1, u, 2, c, t, x, x, 0, x, 0, displaystyle, dot, x, ax, b, u, 1, u, 2, phi, left, c, mathsf, t, x, right, qquad, x, 0, x, 0, where, displaystyle, phi, is, a, nonlinear, function, by, the, additive, state, decomposition, the, system, can, be, additively, decomposed, into, x, 1, a, x, 1, b, u, 1, y, d, x, 1, 0, x, 0, x, 2, a, x, 2, b, u, 2, c, t, x, 1, c, t, x, 2, y, d, x, 2, 0, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, dot, x, 1, ax, 1, bu, 1, phi, y, d, x, 1, 0, x, 0, dot, x, 2, ax, 2, bu, 2, phi, left, c, mathsf, t, x, 1, c, mathsf, t, x, 2, right, phi, y, d, x, 2, 0, 0, end, aligned, with, x, x, 1, x, 2, displaystyle, x, x, 1, x, 2, this, decomposition, can, help, to, simplify, controller, design, according, to, l, on, brillouin, the, principle, of, superposition, was, first, stated, by, daniel, bernoulli, in, 1753, the, general, motion, of, a, vibrating, system, is, given, by, a, superposition, of, its, proper, vibrations, the, principle, was, rejected, by, leonhard, euler, and, then, by, joseph, lagrange, bernoulli, argued, that, any, sonorous, body, could, vibrate, in, a, series, of, simple, modes, with, a, well, defined, frequency, of, oscillation, as, he, had, earlier, indicated, these, modes, could, be, superposed, to, produce, more, complex, vibrations, in, his, reaction, to, bernoulli, s, memoirs, euler, praised, his, colleague, for, having, best, developed, the, physical, part, of, the, problem, of, vibrating, strings, but, denied, the, generality, and, superiority, of, the, multi, modes, solution, later, it, became, accepted, largely, through, the, work, of, joseph, fourier
