in, materials, science, fatigue, is, the, initiation, and, propagation, of, cracks, in, a, material, due, to, cyclic, loading, once, a, fatigue, crack, has, initiated, it, grows, a, small, amount, with, each, loading, cycle, typically, producing, striations, on, some, parts, of, the, fracture, surface, the, crack, will, continue, to, grow, until, it, reaches, a, critical, size, which, occurs, when, the, stress, intensity, factor, of, the, crack, exceeds, the, fracture, toughness, of, the, material, producing, rapid, propagation, and, typically, complete, fracture, of, the, structure, fatigue, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, the, failure, of, metal, components, which, led, to, the, term, metal, fatigue, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, sudden, failing, of, metal, railway, axles, was, thought, to, be, caused, by, the, metal, crystallising, because, of, the, brittle, appearance, of, the, fracture, surface, but, this, has, since, been, disproved, most, materials, such, as, composites, plastics, and, ceramics, seem, to, experience, some, sort, of, fatigue, related, failure, to, aid, in, predicting, the, fatigue, life, of, a, component, fatigue, tests, are, carried, out, using, coupons, to, measure, the, rate, of, crack, growth, by, applying, constant, amplitude, cyclic, loading, and, averaging, the, measured, growth, of, a, crack, over, thousands, of, cycles, however, there, are, also, a, number, of, special, cases, that, need, to, be, considered, where, the, rate, of, crack, growth, is, significantly, different, compared, to, that, obtained, from, constant, amplitude, testing, such, as, the, reduced, rate, of, growth, that, occurs, for, small, loads, near, the, threshold, or, after, the, application, of, an, overload, and, the, increased, rate, of, crack, growth, associated, with, short, cracks, or, after, the, application, of, an, underload, if, the, loads, are, above, a, certain, threshold, microscopic, cracks, will, begin, to, initiate, at, stress, concentrations, such, as, holes, persistent, slip, bands, psbs, composite, interfaces, or, grain, boundaries, in, metals, the, stress, values, that, cause, fatigue, damage, are, typically, much, less, than, the, yield, strength, of, the, material, historically, fatigue, has, been, separated, into, regions, of, high, cycle, fatigue, that, require, more, than, 10, 4, cycles, to, failure, where, stress, is, low, and, primarily, elastic, and, low, cycle, fatigue, where, there, is, significant, plasticity, experiments, have, shown, that, low, cycle, fatigue, is, also, crack, growth, fatigue, failures, both, for, high, and, low, cycles, all, follow, the, same, basic, steps, crack, initiation, crack, growth, stages, i, and, ii, and, finally, ultimate, failure, to, begin, the, process, cracks, must, nucleate, within, a, material, this, process, can, occur, either, at, stress, risers, in, metallic, samples, or, at, areas, with, a, high, void, density, in, polymer, samples, these, cracks, propagate, slowly, at, first, during, stage, i, crack, growth, along, crystallographic, planes, where, shear, stresses, are, highest, once, the, cracks, reach, a, critical, size, they, propagate, quickly, during, stage, ii, crack, growth, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, applied, force, these, cracks, can, eventually, lead, to, the, ultimate, failure, of, the, material, often, in, a, brittle, catastrophic, fashion, the, formation, of, initial, cracks, preceding, fatigue, failure, is, a, separate, process, consisting, of, four, discrete, steps, in, metallic, samples, the, material, will, develop, cell, structures, and, harden, in, response, to, the, applied, load, this, causes, the, amplitude, of, the, applied, stress, to, increase, given, the, new, restraints, on, strain, these, newly, formed, cell, structures, will, eventually, break, down, with, the, formation, of, persistent, slip, bands, psbs, slip, in, the, material, is, localized, at, these, psbs, and, the, exaggerated, slip, can, now, serve, as, a, stress, concentrator, for, a, crack, to, form, nucleation, and, growth, of, a, crack, to, a, detectable, size, accounts, for, most, of, the, cracking, process, it, is, for, this, reason, that, cyclic, fatigue, failures, seem, to, occur, so, suddenly, where, the, bulk, of, the, changes, in, the, material, are, not, visible, without, destructive, testing, even, in, normally, ductile, materials, fatigue, failures, will, resemble, sudden, brittle, failures, psb, induced, slip, planes, result, in, intrusions, and, extrusions, along, the, surface, of, a, material, often, occurring, in, pairs, this, slip, is, not, a, microstructural, change, within, the, material, but, rather, a, propagation, of, dislocations, within, the, material, instead, of, a, smooth, interface, the, intrusions, and, extrusions, will, cause, the, surface, of, the, material, to, resemble, the, edge, of, a, deck, of, cards, where, not, all, cards, are, perfectly, aligned, slip, induced, intrusions, and, extrusions, create, extremely, fine, surface, structures, on, the, material, with, surface, structure, size, inversely, related, to, stress, concentration, factors, psb, induced, surface, slip, can, cause, fractures, to, initiate, these, steps, can, also, be, bypassed, entirely, if, the, cracks, form, at, a, pre, existing, stress, concentrator, such, as, from, an, inclusion, in, the, material, or, from, a, geometric, stress, concentrator, caused, by, a, sharp, internal, corner, or, fillet, most, of, the, fatigue, life, is, generally, consumed, in, the, crack, growth, phase, the, rate, of, growth, is, primarily, driven, by, the, range, of, cyclic, loading, although, additional, factors, such, as, mean, stress, environment, overloads, and, underloads, can, also, affect, the, rate, of, growth, crack, growth, may, stop, if, the, loads, are, small, enough, to, fall, below, a, critical, threshold, fatigue, cracks, can, grow, from, material, or, manufacturing, defects, from, as, small, as, 10, m, when, the, rate, of, growth, becomes, large, enough, fatigue, striations, can, be, seen, on, the, fracture, surface, striations, mark, the, position, of, the, crack, tip, and, the, width, of, each, striation, represents, the, growth, from, one, loading, cycle, striations, are, a, result, of, plasticity, at, the, crack, tip, when, the, stress, intensity, exceeds, a, critical, value, known, as, the, fracture, toughness, unsustainable, fast, fracture, will, occur, usually, by, a, process, of, microvoid, coalescence, prior, to, final, fracture, the, fracture, surface, may, contain, a, mixture, of, areas, of, fatigue, and, fast, fracture, the, following, effects, change, the, rate, of, growth, the, american, society, for, testing, and, materials, defines, fatigue, life, n, f, as, the, number, of, stress, cycles, of, a, specified, character, that, a, specimen, sustains, before, failure, of, a, specified, nature, occurs, for, some, materials, notably, steel, and, titanium, there, is, a, theoretical, value, for, stress, amplitude, below, which, the, material, will, not, fail, for, any, number, of, cycles, called, a, fatigue, limit, or, endurance, limit, however, in, practice, several, bodies, of, work, done, at, greater, numbers, of, cycles, suggest, that, fatigue, limits, do, not, exist, for, any, metals, engineers, have, used, a, number, of, methods, to, determine, the, fatigue, life, of, a, material, whether, using, stress, strain, life, approach, or, using, crack, growth, approach, complex, or, variable, amplitude, loading, is, reduced, to, a, series, of, fatigue, equivalent, simple, cyclic, loadings, using, a, technique, such, as, the, rainflow, counting, algorithm, a, mechanical, part, is, often, exposed, to, a, complex, often, random, sequence, of, loads, large, and, small, in, order, to, assess, the, safe, life, of, such, a, part, using, the, fatigue, damage, or, stress, strain, life, methods, the, following, series, of, steps, is, usually, performed, since, s, n, curves, are, typically, generated, for, uniaxial, loading, some, equivalence, rule, is, needed, whenever, the, loading, is, multiaxial, for, simple, proportional, loading, histories, lateral, load, in, a, constant, ratio, with, the, axial, sines, rule, may, be, applied, for, more, complex, situations, such, as, non, proportional, loading, critical, plane, analysis, must, be, applied, in, 1945, milton, a, miner, popularised, a, rule, that, had, first, been, proposed, by, arvid, palmgren, in, 1924, the, rule, variously, called, miner, s, rule, or, the, palmgren, miner, linear, damage, hypothesis, states, that, where, there, are, k, different, stress, magnitudes, in, a, spectrum, s, i, 1, i, k, each, contributing, n, i, s, i, cycles, then, if, n, i, s, i, is, the, number, of, cycles, to, failure, of, a, constant, stress, reversal, s, i, determined, by, uni, axial, fatigue, tests, failure, occurs, when, usually, for, design, purposes, c, is, assumed, to, be, 1, this, can, be, thought, of, as, assessing, what, proportion, of, life, is, consumed, by, a, linear, combination, of, stress, reversals, at, varying, magnitudes, although, miner, s, rule, may, be, a, useful, approximation, in, many, circumstances, it, has, several, major, limitations, materials, fatigue, performance, is, commonly, characterized, by, an, s, n, curve, also, known, as, a, w, hler, curve, this, is, often, plotted, with, the, cyclic, stress, s, against, the, cycles, to, failure, n, on, a, logarithmic, scale, s, n, curves, are, derived, from, tests, on, samples, of, the, material, to, be, characterized, often, called, coupons, or, specimens, where, a, regular, sinusoidal, stress, is, applied, by, a, testing, machine, which, also, counts, the, number, of, cycles, to, failure, this, process, is, sometimes, known, as, coupon, testing, for, greater, accuracy, but, lower, generality, component, testing, is, used, each, coupon, or, component, test, generates, a, point, on, the, plot, though, in, some, cases, there, is, a, runout, where, the, time, to, failure, exceeds, that, available, for, the, test, see, censoring, analysis, of, fatigue, data, requires, techniques, from, statistics, especially, survival, analysis, and, linear, regression, the, progression, of, the, s, n, curve, can, be, influenced, by, many, factors, such, as, stress, ratio, mean, stress, loading, frequency, temperature, corrosion, residual, stresses, and, the, presence, of, notches, a, constant, fatigue, life, cfl, diagram, is, useful, for, the, study, of, stress, ratio, effect, the, goodman, line, is, a, method, used, to, estimate, the, influence, of, the, mean, stress, on, the, fatigue, strength, a, constant, fatigue, life, cfl, diagram, is, useful, for, stress, ratio, effect, on, s, n, curve, also, in, the, presence, of, a, steady, stress, superimposed, on, the, cyclic, loading, the, goodman, relation, can, be, used, to, estimate, a, failure, condition, it, plots, stress, amplitude, against, mean, stress, with, the, fatigue, limit, and, the, ultimate, tensile, strength, of, the, material, as, the, two, extremes, alternative, failure, criteria, include, soderberg, and, gerber, as, coupons, sampled, from, a, homogeneous, frame, will, display, a, variation, in, their, number, of, cycles, to, failure, the, s, n, curve, should, more, properly, be, a, stress, cycle, probability, s, n, p, curve, to, capture, the, probability, of, failure, after, a, given, number, of, cycles, of, a, certain, stress, with, body, centered, cubic, materials, bcc, the, w, hler, curve, often, becomes, a, horizontal, line, with, decreasing, stress, amplitude, i, e, there, is, a, fatigue, strength, that, can, be, assigned, to, these, materials, with, face, centered, cubic, metals, fcc, the, w, hler, curve, generally, drops, continuously, so, that, only, a, fatigue, limit, can, be, assigned, to, these, materials, when, strains, are, no, longer, elastic, such, as, in, the, presence, of, stress, concentrations, the, total, strain, can, be, used, instead, of, stress, as, a, similitude, parameter, this, is, known, as, the, strain, life, method, the, total, strain, amplitude, 2, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, 2, is, the, sum, of, the, elastic, strain, amplitude, e, 2, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, text, e, 2, and, the, plastic, strain, amplitude, p, 2, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, text, p, 2, and, is, given, by, basquin, s, equation, for, the, elastic, strain, amplitude, is, where, e, displaystyle, e, is, young, s, modulus, the, relation, for, high, cycle, fatigue, can, be, expressed, using, the, elastic, strain, amplitude, where, f, displaystyle, sigma, text, f, prime, is, a, parameter, that, scales, with, tensile, strength, obtained, by, fitting, experimental, data, n, f, displaystyle, n, text, f, is, the, number, of, cycles, to, failure, and, b, displaystyle, b, is, the, slope, of, the, log, log, curve, again, determined, by, curve, fitting, in, 1954, coffin, and, manson, proposed, that, the, fatigue, life, of, a, component, was, related, to, the, plastic, strain, amplitude, using, combining, the, elastic, and, plastic, portions, gives, the, total, strain, amplitude, accounting, for, both, low, and, high, cycle, fatigue, where, f, displaystyle, sigma, f, is, the, fatigue, strength, coefficient, b, displaystyle, b, is, the, fatigue, strength, exponent, f, displaystyle, varepsilon, f, is, the, fatigue, ductility, coefficient, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, fatigue, ductility, exponent, and, n, f, displaystyle, n, f, is, the, number, of, cycles, to, failure, 2, n, f, displaystyle, 2n, f, being, the, number, of, reversals, to, failure, an, estimate, of, the, fatigue, life, of, a, component, can, be, made, using, a, crack, growth, equation, by, summing, up, the, width, of, each, increment, of, crack, growth, for, each, loading, cycle, safety, or, scatter, factors, are, applied, to, the, calculated, life, to, account, for, any, uncertainty, and, variability, associated, with, fatigue, the, rate, of, growth, used, in, crack, growth, predictions, is, typically, measured, by, applying, thousands, of, constant, amplitude, cycles, to, a, coupon, and, measuring, the, rate, of, growth, from, the, change, in, compliance, of, the, coupon, or, by, measuring, the, growth, of, the, crack, on, the, surface, of, the, coupon, standard, methods, for, measuring, the, rate, of, growth, have, been, developed, by, astm, international, crack, growth, equations, such, as, the, paris, erdo, an, equation, are, used, to, predict, the, life, of, a, component, they, can, be, used, to, predict, the, growth, of, a, crack, from, 10, um, to, failure, for, normal, manufacturing, finishes, this, may, cover, most, of, the, fatigue, life, of, a, component, where, growth, can, start, from, the, first, cycle, the, conditions, at, the, crack, tip, of, a, component, are, usually, related, to, the, conditions, of, test, coupon, using, a, characterising, parameter, such, as, the, stress, intensity, j, integral, or, crack, tip, opening, displacement, all, these, techniques, aim, to, match, the, crack, tip, conditions, on, the, component, to, that, of, test, coupons, which, give, the, rate, of, crack, growth, additional, models, may, be, necessary, to, include, retardation, and, acceleration, effects, associated, with, overloads, or, underloads, in, the, loading, sequence, in, addition, small, crack, growth, data, may, be, needed, to, match, the, increased, rate, of, growth, seen, with, small, cracks, typically, a, cycle, counting, technique, such, as, rainflow, cycle, counting, is, used, to, extract, the, cycles, from, a, complex, sequence, this, technique, along, with, others, has, been, shown, to, work, with, crack, growth, methods, crack, growth, methods, have, the, advantage, that, they, can, predict, the, intermediate, size, of, cracks, this, information, can, be, used, to, schedule, inspections, on, a, structure, to, ensure, safety, whereas, strain, life, methods, only, give, a, life, until, failure, dependable, design, against, fatigue, failure, requires, thorough, education, and, supervised, experience, in, structural, engineering, mechanical, engineering, or, materials, science, there, are, at, least, five, principal, approaches, to, life, assurance, for, mechanical, parts, that, display, increasing, degrees, of, sophistication, fatigue, testing, can, be, used, for, components, such, as, a, coupon, or, a, full, scale, test, article, to, determine, these, tests, may, form, part, of, the, certification, process, such, as, for, airworthiness, certification, composite, materials, can, offer, excellent, resistance, to, fatigue, loading, in, general, composites, exhibit, good, fracture, toughness, and, unlike, metals, increase, fracture, toughness, with, increasing, strength, the, critical, damage, size, in, composites, is, also, greater, than, that, for, metals, the, primary, mode, of, damage, in, a, metal, structure, is, cracking, for, metal, cracks, propagate, in, a, relatively, well, defined, manner, with, respect, to, the, applied, stress, and, the, critical, crack, size, and, rate, of, crack, propagation, can, be, related, to, specimen, data, through, analytical, fracture, mechanics, however, with, composite, structures, there, is, no, single, damage, mode, which, dominates, matrix, cracking, delamination, debonding, voids, fiber, fracture, and, composite, cracking, can, all, occur, separately, and, in, combination, and, the, predominance, of, one, or, more, is, highly, dependent, on, the, laminate, orientations, and, loading, conditions, in, addition, the, unique, joints, and, attachments, used, for, composite, structures, often, introduce, modes, of, failure, different, from, those, typified, by, the, laminate, itself, the, composite, damage, propagates, in, a, less, regular, manner, and, damage, modes, can, change, experience, with, composites, indicates, that, the, rate, of, damage, propagation, in, does, not, exhibit, the, two, distinct, regions, of, initiation, and, propagation, like, metals, the, crack, initiation, range, in, metals, is, propagation, and, there, is, a, significant, quantitative, difference, in, rate, while, the, difference, appears, to, be, less, apparent, with, composites, fatigue, cracks, of, composites, may, form, in, the, matrix, and, propagate, slowly, since, the, matrix, carries, such, a, small, fraction, of, the, applied, stress, and, the, fibers, in, the, wake, of, the, crack, experience, fatigue, damage, in, many, cases, the, damage, rate, is, accelerated, by, deleterious, interactions, with, the, environment, like, oxidation, or, corrosion, of, fibers, following, the, king, louis, philippe, i, s, celebrations, at, the, palace, of, versailles, a, train, returning, to, paris, crashed, in, may, 1842, at, meudon, after, the, leading, locomotive, broke, an, axle, the, carriages, behind, piled, into, the, wrecked, engines, and, caught, fire, at, least, 55, passengers, were, killed, trapped, in, the, locked, carriages, including, the, explorer, jules, dumont, d, urville, this, accident, is, known, in, france, as, the, catastrophe, ferroviaire, de, meudon, the, accident, was, witnessed, by, the, british, locomotive, engineer, joseph, locke, and, widely, reported, in, britain, it, was, discussed, extensively, by, engineers, who, sought, an, explanation, the, derailment, had, been, the, result, of, a, broken, locomotive, axle, rankine, s, investigation, of, broken, axles, in, britain, highlighted, the, importance, of, stress, concentration, and, the, mechanism, of, crack, growth, with, repeated, loading, his, and, other, papers, suggesting, a, crack, growth, mechanism, through, repeated, stressing, however, were, ignored, and, fatigue, failures, occurred, at, an, ever, increasing, rate, on, the, expanding, railway, system, other, spurious, theories, seemed, to, be, more, acceptable, such, as, the, idea, that, the, metal, had, somehow, crystallized, the, notion, was, based, on, the, crystalline, appearance, of, the, fast, fracture, region, of, the, crack, surface, but, ignored, the, fact, that, the, metal, was, already, highly, crystalline, two, de, havilland, comet, passenger, jets, broke, up, in, mid, air, and, crashed, within, a, few, months, of, each, other, in, 1954, as, a,

establishment, rae, were, able, to, conclude, that, the, crash, had, been, due, to, failure, of, the, pressure, cabin, at, the, forward, automatic, direction, finder, window, in, the, roof, this, window, was, in, fact, one, of, two, apertures, for, the, aerials, of, an, electronic, navigation, system, in, which, opaque, fibreglass, panels, took, the, place, of, the, window, glass, the, failure, was, a, result, of, metal, fatigue, caused, by, the, repeated, pressurisation, and, de, pressurisation, of, the, aircraft, cabin, also, the, supports, around, the, windows, were, riveted, not, bonded, as, the, original, specifications, for, the, aircraft, had, called, for, the, problem, was, exacerbated, by, the, punch, rivet, construction, technique, employed, unlike, drill, riveting, the, imperfect, nature, of, the, hole, created, by, punch, riveting, caused, manufacturing, defect, cracks, which, may, have, caused, the, start, of, fatigue, cracks, around, the, rivet, the, comet, s, pressure, cabin, had, been, designed, to, a, safety, factor, comfortably, in, excess, of, that, required, by, british, civil, airworthiness, requirements, 2, 5, times, the, cabin, proof, test, pressure, as, opposed, to, the, requirement, of, 1, 33, times, and, an, ultimate, load, of, 2, 0, times, the, cabin, pressure, and, the, accident, caused, a, revision, in, the, estimates, of, the, safe, loading, strength, requirements, of, airliner, pressure, cabins, in, addition, it, was, discovered, that, the, stresses, around, pressure, cabin, apertures, were, considerably, higher, than, had, been, anticipated, especially, around, sharp, cornered, cut, outs, such, as, windows, as, a, result, all, future, jet, airliners, would, feature, windows, with, rounded, corners, greatly, reducing, the, stress, concentration, this, was, a, noticeable, distinguishing, feature, of, all, later, models, of, the, comet, investigators, from, the, rae, told, a, public, inquiry, that, the, sharp, corners, near, the, comets, window, openings, acted, as, initiation, sites, for, cracks, the, skin, of, the, aircraft, was, also, too, thin, and, cracks, from, manufacturing, stresses, were, present, at, the, corners, alexander, l, kielland, was, a, norwegian, semi, submersible, drilling, rig, that, capsized, whilst, working, in, the, ekofisk, oil, field, in, march, 1980, killing, 123, people, the, capsizing, was, the, worst, disaster, in, norwegian, waters, since, world, war, ii, the, rig, located, approximately, 320, km, east, of, dundee, scotland, was, owned, by, the, stavanger, drilling, company, of, norway, and, was, on, hire, to, the, united, states, company, phillips, petroleum, at, the, time, of, the, disaster, in, driving, rain, and, mist, early, in, the, evening, of, 27, march, 1980, more, than, 200, men, were, off, duty, in, the, accommodation, on, alexander, l, kielland, the, wind, was, gusting, to, 40, knots, with, waves, up, to, 12, m, high, the, rig, had, just, been, winched, away, from, the, edda, production, platform, minutes, before, 18, 30, those, on, board, felt, a, sharp, crack, followed, by, some, kind, of, trembling, suddenly, the, rig, heeled, over, 30, and, then, stabilised, five, of, the, six, anchor, cables, had, broken, with, one, remaining, cable, preventing, the, rig, from, capsizing, the, list, continued, to, increase, and, at, 18, 53, the, remaining, anchor, cable, snapped, and, the, rig, turned, upside, down, a, year, later, in, march, 1981, the, investigative, report, concluded, that, the, rig, collapsed, owing, to, a, fatigue, crack, in, one, of, its, six, bracings, bracing, d, 6, which, connected, the, collapsed, d, leg, to, the, rest, of, the, rig, this, was, traced, to, a, small, 6, mm, fillet, weld, which, joined, a, non, load, bearing, flange, plate, to, this, d, 6, bracing, this, flange, plate, held, a, sonar, device, used, during, drilling, operations, the, poor, profile, of, the, fillet, weld, contributed, to, a, reduction, in, its, fatigue, strength, further, the, investigation, found, considerable, amounts, of, lamellar, tearing, in, the, flange, plate, and, cold, cracks, in, the, butt, weld, cold, cracks, in, the, welds, increased, stress, concentrations, due, to, the, weakened, flange, plate, the, poor, weld, profile, and, cyclical, stresses, which, would, be, common, in, the, north, sea, seemed, to, collectively, play, a, role, in, the, rig, s, collapse
