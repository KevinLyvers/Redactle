strontium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, sr, and, atomic, number, 38, an, alkaline, earth, metal, strontium, is, a, soft, silver, white, yellowish, metallic, element, that, is, highly, chemically, reactive, the, metal, forms, a, dark, oxide, layer, when, it, is, exposed, to, air, strontium, has, physical, and, chemical, properties, similar, to, those, of, its, two, vertical, neighbors, in, the, periodic, table, calcium, and, barium, it, occurs, naturally, mainly, in, the, minerals, celestine, and, strontianite, and, is, mostly, mined, from, these, both, strontium, and, strontianite, are, named, after, strontian, a, village, in, scotland, near, which, the, mineral, was, discovered, in, 1790, by, adair, crawford, and, william, cruickshank, it, was, identified, as, a, new, element, the, next, year, from, its, crimson, red, flame, test, color, strontium, was, first, isolated, as, a, metal, in, 1808, by, humphry, davy, using, the, then, newly, discovered, process, of, electrolysis, during, the, 19th, century, strontium, was, mostly, used, in, the, production, of, sugar, from, sugar, beets, see, strontian, process, at, the, peak, of, production, of, television, cathode, ray, tubes, as, much, as, 75, of, strontium, consumption, in, the, united, states, was, used, for, the, faceplate, glass, with, the, replacement, of, cathode, ray, tubes, with, other, display, methods, consumption, of, strontium, has, dramatically, declined, while, natural, strontium, which, is, mostly, the, isotope, strontium, 88, is, stable, the, synthetic, strontium, 90, is, radioactive, and, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, components, of, nuclear, fallout, as, strontium, is, absorbed, by, the, body, in, a, similar, manner, to, calcium, natural, stable, strontium, on, the, other, hand, is, not, hazardous, to, health, strontium, is, a, divalent, silvery, metal, with, a, pale, yellow, tint, whose, properties, are, mostly, intermediate, between, and, similar, to, those, of, its, group, neighbors, calcium, and, barium, it, is, softer, than, calcium, and, harder, than, barium, its, melting, 777, c, and, boiling, 1377, c, points, are, lower, than, those, of, calcium, 842, c, and, 1484, c, respectively, barium, continues, this, downward, trend, in, the, melting, point, 727, c, but, not, in, the, boiling, point, 1900, c, the, density, of, strontium, 2, 64, g, cm, 3, is, similarly, intermediate, between, those, of, calcium, 1, 54, g, cm, 3, and, barium, 3, 594, g, cm, 3, three, allotropes, of, metallic, strontium, exist, with, transition, points, at, 235, and, 540, c, the, standard, electrode, potential, for, the, sr, 2, sr, couple, is, 2, 89, v, approximately, midway, between, those, of, the, ca, 2, ca, 2, 84, v, and, ba, 2, ba, 2, 92, v, couples, and, close, to, those, of, the, neighboring, alkali, metals, strontium, is, intermediate, between, calcium, and, barium, in, its, reactivity, toward, water, with, which, it, reacts, on, contact, to, produce, strontium, hydroxide, and, hydrogen, gas, strontium, metal, burns, in, air, to, produce, both, strontium, oxide, and, strontium, nitride, but, since, it, does, not, react, with, nitrogen, below, 380, c, at, room, temperature, it, forms, only, the, oxide, spontaneously, besides, the, simple, oxide, sro, the, peroxide, sro, 2, can, be, made, by, direct, oxidation, of, strontium, metal, under, a, high, pressure, of, oxygen, and, there, is, some, evidence, for, a, yellow, superoxide, sr, o, 2, 2, strontium, hydroxide, sr, oh, 2, is, a, strong, base, though, it, is, not, as, strong, as, the, hydroxides, of, barium, or, the, alkali, metals, all, four, dihalides, of, strontium, are, known, due, to, the, large, size, of, the, heavy, s, block, elements, including, strontium, a, vast, range, of, coordination, numbers, is, known, from, 2, 3, or, 4, all, the, way, to, 22, or, 24, in, srcd, 11, and, srzn, 13, the, sr, 2, ion, is, quite, large, so, that, high, coordination, numbers, are, the, rule, the, large, size, of, strontium, and, barium, plays, a, significant, part, in, stabilising, strontium, complexes, with, polydentate, macrocyclic, ligands, such, as, crown, ethers, for, example, while, 18, crown, 6, forms, relatively, weak, complexes, with, calcium, and, the, alkali, metals, its, strontium, and, barium, complexes, are, much, stronger, organostrontium, compounds, contain, one, or, more, strontium, carbon, bonds, they, have, been, reported, as, intermediates, in, barbier, type, reactions, although, strontium, is, in, the, same, group, as, magnesium, and, organomagnesium, compounds, are, very, commonly, used, throughout, chemistry, organostrontium, compounds, are, not, similarly, widespread, because, they, are, more, difficult, to, make, and, more, reactive, organostrontium, compounds, tend, to, be, more, similar, to, organo, europium, or, organo, samarium, compounds, due, to, the, similar, ionic, radii, of, these, elements, sr, 2, 118, pm, eu, 2, 117, pm, sm, 2, 122, pm, most, of, these, compounds, can, only, be, prepared, at, low, temperatures, bulky, ligands, tend, to, favor, stability, for, example, strontium, di, cyclopentadienyl, sr, c, 5, h, 5, 2, must, be, made, by, directly, reacting, strontium, metal, with, mercurocene, or, cyclopentadiene, itself, replacing, the, c, 5, h, 5, ligand, with, the, bulkier, c, 5, ch, 3, 5, ligand, on, the, other, hand, increases, the, compound, s, solubility, volatility, and, kinetic, stability, because, of, its, extreme, reactivity, with, oxygen, and, water, strontium, occurs, naturally, only, in, compounds, with, other, elements, such, as, in, the, minerals, strontianite, and, celestine, it, is, kept, under, a, liquid, hydrocarbon, such, as, mineral, oil, or, kerosene, to, prevent, oxidation, freshly, exposed, strontium, metal, rapidly, turns, a, yellowish, color, with, the, formation, of, the, oxide, finely, powdered, strontium, metal, is, pyrophoric, meaning, that, it, will, ignite, spontaneously, in, air, at, room, temperature, volatile, strontium, salts, impart, a, bright, red, color, to, flames, and, these, salts, are, used, in, pyrotechnics, and, in, the, production, of, flares, like, calcium, and, barium, as, well, as, the, alkali, metals, and, the, divalent, lanthanides, europium, and, ytterbium, strontium, metal, dissolves, directly, in, liquid, ammonia, to, give, a, dark, blue, solution, of, solvated, electrons, natural, strontium, is, a, mixture, of, four, stable, isotopes, 84, sr, 86, sr, 87, sr, and, 88, sr, on, these, isotopes, 88, sr, is, the, most, abundant, makes, up, about, 82, 6, of, all, natural, strontium, though, the, abundance, varies, due, to, the, production, of, radiogenic, 87, sr, as, the, daughter, of, long, lived, beta, decaying, 87, rb, this, is, the, basis, of, rubidium, strontium, dating, of, the, unstable, isotopes, the, primary, decay, mode, of, the, isotopes, lighter, than, 85, sr, is, electron, capture, or, positron, emission, to, isotopes, of, rubidium, and, that, of, the, isotopes, heavier, than, 88, sr, is, electron, emission, to, isotopes, of, yttrium, of, special, note, are, 89, sr, and, 90, sr, the, former, has, a, half, life, of, 50, 6, days, and, is, used, to, treat, bone, cancer, due, to, strontium, s, chemical, similarity, and, hence, ability, to, replace, calcium, while, 90, sr, half, life, 28, 90, years, has, been, used, similarly, it, is, also, an, isotope, of, concern, in, fallout, from, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, accidents, due, to, its, production, as, a, fission, product, its, presence, in, bones, can, cause, bone, cancer, cancer, of, nearby, tissues, and, leukemia, the, 1986, chernobyl, nuclear, accident, contaminated, about, 30, 000, km, 2, with, greater, than, 10, kbq, m, 2, with, 90, sr, which, accounts, for, about, 5, of, the, 90, sr, which, was, in, the, reactor, core, strontium, is, named, after, the, scottish, village, of, strontian, scottish, gaelic, sr, n, an, t, s, thein, where, it, was, discovered, in, the, ores, of, the, lead, mines, in, 1790, adair, crawford, a, physician, engaged, in, the, preparation, of, barium, and, his, colleague, william, cruickshank, recognised, that, the, strontian, ores, exhibited, properties, that, differed, from, those, in, other, heavy, spars, sources, this, allowed, crawford, to, conclude, on, page, 355, it, is, probable, indeed, that, the, scotch, mineral, is, a, new, species, of, earth, which, has, not, hitherto, been, sufficiently, examined, the, physician, and, mineral, collector, friedrich, gabriel, sulzer, analysed, together, with, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, the, mineral, from, strontian, and, named, it, strontianite, he, also, came, to, the, conclusion, that, it, was, distinct, from, the, witherite, and, contained, a, new, earth, neue, grunderde, in, 1793, thomas, charles, hope, a, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, glasgow, studied, the, mineral, and, proposed, the, name, strontites, he, confirmed, the, earlier, work, of, crawford, and, recounted, considering, it, a, peculiar, earth, i, thought, it, necessary, to, give, it, an, name, i, have, called, it, strontites, from, the, place, it, was, found, a, mode, of, derivation, in, my, opinion, fully, as, proper, as, any, quality, it, may, possess, which, is, the, present, fashion, the, element, was, eventually, isolated, by, sir, humphry, davy, in, 1808, by, the, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, containing, strontium, chloride, and, mercuric, oxide, and, announced, by, him, in, a, lecture, to, the, royal, society, on, 30, june, 1808, in, keeping, with, the, naming, of, the, other, alkaline, earths, he, changed, the, name, to, strontium, the, first, large, scale, application, of, strontium, was, in, the, production, of, sugar, from, sugar, beet, although, a, crystallisation, process, using, strontium, hydroxide, was, patented, by, augustin, pierre, dubrunfaut, in, 1849, the, large, scale, introduction, came, with, the, improvement, of, the, process, in, the, early, 1870s, the, german, sugar, industry, used, the, process, well, into, the, 20th, century, before, world, war, i, the, beet, sugar, industry, used, 100, 000, to, 150, 000, tons, of, strontium, hydroxide, for, this, process, per, year, the, strontium, hydroxide, was, recycled, in, the, process, but, the, demand, to, substitute, losses, during, production, was, high, enough, to, create, a, significant, demand, initiating, mining, of, strontianite, in, the, m, nsterland, the, mining, of, strontianite, in, germany, ended, when, mining, of, the, celestine, deposits, in, gloucestershire, started, these, mines, supplied, most, of, the, world, strontium, supply, from, 1884, to, 1941, although, the, celestine, deposits, in, the, granada, basin, were, known, for, some, time, the, large, scale, mining, did, not, start, before, the, 1950s, during, atmospheric, nuclear, weapons, testing, it, was, observed, that, strontium, 90, is, one, of, the, nuclear, fission, products, with, a, relatively, high, yield, the, similarity, to, calcium, and, the, chance, that, the, strontium, 90, might, become, enriched, in, bones, made, research, on, the, metabolism, of, strontium, an, important, topic, strontium, commonly, occurs, in, nature, being, the, 15th, most, abundant, element, on, earth, its, heavier, congener, barium, being, the, 14th, estimated, to, average, approximately, 360, parts, per, million, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, found, chiefly, as, the, sulfate, mineral, celestine, srso, 4, and, the, carbonate, strontianite, srco, 3, of, the, two, celestine, occurs, much, more, frequently, in, deposits, of, sufficient, size, for, mining, because, strontium, is, used, most, often, in, the, carbonate, form, strontianite, would, be, the, more, useful, of, the, two, common, minerals, but, few, deposits, have, been, discovered, that, are, suitable, for, development, because, of, the, way, it, reacts, with, air, and, water, strontium, only, exists, in, nature, when, combined, to, form, minerals, naturally, occurring, strontium, is, stable, but, its, synthetic, isotope, sr, 90, is, only, produced, by, nuclear, fallout, in, groundwater, strontium, behaves, chemically, much, like, calcium, at, intermediate, to, acidic, ph, sr, 2, is, the, dominant, strontium, species, in, the, presence, of, calcium, ions, strontium, commonly, forms, coprecipitates, with, calcium, minerals, such, as, calcite, and, anhydrite, at, an, increased, ph, at, intermediate, to, acidic, ph, dissolved, strontium, is, bound, to, soil, particles, by, cation, exchange, the, mean, strontium, content, of, ocean, water, is, 8, mg, l, at, a, concentration, between, 82, and, 90, mol, l, of, strontium, the, concentration, is, considerably, lower, than, the, calcium, concentration, which, is, normally, between, 9, 6, and, 11, 6, mmol, l, it, is, nevertheless, much, higher, than, that, of, barium, 13, g, l, the, three, major, producers, of, strontium, as, celestine, as, of, 2015, are, china, 150, 000, t, spain, 90, 000, t, and, mexico, 70, 000, t, argentina, 10, 000, t, and, morocco, 2, 500, t, are, smaller, producers, although, strontium, deposits, occur, widely, in, the, united, states, they, have, not, been, mined, since, 1959, a, large, proportion, of, mined, celestine, srso, 4, is, converted, to, the, carbonate, by, two, processes, either, the, celestine, is, directly, leached, with, sodium, carbonate, solution, or, the, celestine, is, roasted, with, coal, to, form, the, sulfide, the, second, stage, produces, a, dark, coloured, material, containing, mostly, strontium, sulfide, this, so, called, black, ash, is, dissolved, in, water, and, filtered, strontium, carbonate, is, precipitated, from, the, strontium, sulfide, solution, by, introduction, of, carbon, dioxide, the, sulfate, is, reduced, to, the, sulfide, by, the, carbothermic, reduction, about, 300, 000, tons, are, processed, in, this, way, annually, the, metal, is, produced, commercially, by, reducing, strontium, oxide, with, aluminium, the, strontium, is, distilled, from, the, mixture, strontium, metal, can, also, be, prepared, on, a, small, scale, by, electrolysis, of, a, solution, of, strontium, chloride, in, molten, potassium, chloride, consuming, 75, of, production, the, primary, use, for, strontium, was, in, glass, for, colour, television, cathode, ray, tubes, where, it, prevented, x, ray, emission, this, application, for, strontium, has, been, declining, because, crts, are, being, replaced, by, other, display, methods, this, decline, has, a, significant, influence, on, the, mining, and, refining, of, strontium, all, parts, of, the, crt, must, absorb, x, rays, in, the, neck, and, the, funnel, of, the, tube, lead, glass, is, used, for, this, purpose, but, this, type, of, glass, shows, a, browning, effect, due, to, the, interaction, of, the, x, rays, with, the, glass, therefore, the, front, panel, is, made, from, a, different, glass, mixture, with, strontium, and, barium, to, absorb, the, x, rays, the, average, values, for, the, glass, mixture, determined, for, a, recycling, study, in, 2005, is, 8, 5, strontium, oxide, and, 10, barium, oxide, because, strontium, is, so, similar, to, calcium, it, is, incorporated, in, the, bone, all, four, stable, isotopes, are, incorporated, in, roughly, the, same, proportions, they, are, found, in, nature, however, the, actual, distribution, of, the, isotopes, tends, to, vary, greatly, from, one, geographical, location, to, another, thus, analyzing, the, bone, of, an, individual, can, help, determine, the, region, it, came, from, this, approach, helps, to, identify, the, ancient, migration, patterns, and, the, origin, of, commingled, human, remains, in, battlefield, burial, sites, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratios, are, commonly, used, to, determine, the, likely, provenance, areas, of, sediment, in, natural, systems, especially, in, marine, and, fluvial, environments, dasch, 1969, showed, that, surface, sediments, of, atlantic, displayed, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratios, that, could, be, regarded, as, bulk, averages, of, the, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratios, of, geological, terrains, from, adjacent, landmasses, a, good, example, of, a, fluvial, marine, system, to, which, sr, isotope, provenance, studies, have, been, successfully, employed, is, the, river, nile, mediterranean, system, due, to, the, differing, ages, of, the, rocks, that, constitute, the, majority, of, the, blue, and, white, nile, catchment, areas, of, the, changing, provenance, of, sediment, reaching, the, river, nile, delta, and, east, mediterranean, sea, can, be, discerned, through, strontium, isotopic, studies, such, changes, are, climatically, controlled, in, the, late, quaternary, more, recently, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratios, have, also, been, used, to, determine, the, source, of, ancient, archaeological, materials, such, as, timbers, and, corn, in, chaco, canyon, new, mexico, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratios, in, teeth, may, also, be, used, to, track, animal, migrations, strontium, aluminate, is, frequently, used, in, glow, in, the, dark, toys, as, it, is, chemically, and, biologically, inert, strontium, carbonate, and, other, strontium, salts, are, added, to, fireworks, to, give, a, deep, red, colour, this, same, effect, identifies, strontium, cations, in, the, flame, test, fireworks, consume, about, 5, of, the, world, s, production, strontium, carbonate, is, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, hard, ferrite, magnets, strontium, chloride, is, sometimes, used, in, toothpastes, for, sensitive, teeth, one, popular, brand, includes, 10, total, strontium, chloride, hexahydrate, by, weight, small, amounts, are, used, in, the, refining, of, zinc, to, remove, small, amounts, of, lead, impurities, the, metal, itself, has, a, limited, use, as, a, getter, to, remove, unwanted, gases, in, vacuums, by, reacting, with, them, although, barium, may, also, be, used, for, this, purpose, the, ultra, narrow, optical, transition, between, the, 5s, 2, 1, s, 0, electronic, ground, state, and, the, metastable, 5s5p, 3, p, 0, excited, state, of, 87, sr, is, one, of, the, leading, candidates, for, the, future, re, definition, of, the, second, in, terms, of, an, optical, transition, as, opposed, to, the, current, definition, derived, from, a, microwave, transition, between, different, hyperfine, ground, states, of, 133, cs, current, optical, atomic, clocks, operating, on, this, transition, already, surpass, the, precision, and, accuracy, of, the, current, definition, of, the, second, 89, sr, is, the, active, ingredient, in, metastron, a, radiopharmaceutical, used, for, bone, pain, secondary, to, metastatic, bone, cancer, the, strontium, is, processed, like, calcium, by, the, body, preferentially, incorporating, it, into, bone, at, sites, of, increased, osteogenesis, this, localization, focuses, the, radiation, exposure, on, the, cancerous, lesion, 90, sr, has, been, used, as, a, power, source, for, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, rtgs, 90, sr, produces, approximately, 0, 93, watts, of, heat, per, gram, it, is, lower, for, the, form, of, 90, sr, used, in, rtgs, which, is, strontium, fluoride, however, 90, sr, has, one, third, the, lifetime, and, a, lower, density, than, 238, pu, another, rtg, fuel, the, main, advantage, of, 90, sr, is, that, it, is, significantly, cheaper, than, 238, pu, and, is, found, in, nuclear, waste, the, latter, must, be, prepared, by, irradiating, 237, np, with, neutrons, then, separating, the, modest, amounts, of, 238, pu, the, principal, disadvantage, of, 90, sr, is, the, high, energy, beta, particles, produce, bremsstrahlung, as, they, encounter, nuclei, of, other, nearby, heavy, atoms, such, as, adjacent, strontium, this, is, mostly, in, the, range, of, x, rays, thus, strong, beta, emitters, also, emit, significant, secondary, x, rays, in, most, cases, this, requires, significant, shielding, measures, which, complicates, the, design, of, rtgs, using, 90, sr, the, soviet, union, deployed, nearly, 1000, of, these, rtgs, on, its, northern, coast, as, a, power, source, for, lighthouses, and, meteorology, stations, acantharea, a, relatively, large, group, of, marine, radiolarian, protozoa, produce, intricate, mineral, skeletons, composed, of, strontium, sulfate, in, biological, systems, calcium, is, substituted, to, a, small, extent, by, strontium, in, the, human, body, most, of, the, absorbed, strontium, is, deposited, in, the, bones, the, ratio, of, strontium, to, calcium, in, human, bones, is, between, 1, 1000, and, 1, 2000, roughly, in, the, same, range, as, in, the, blood, serum, the, human, body, absorbs, strontium, as, if, it, were, its, lighter, congener, calcium, because, the, elements, are, chemically, very, similar, stable, strontium, isotopes, do, not, pose, a, significant, health, threat, the, average, human, has, an, intake, of, about, two, milligrams, of, strontium, a, day, in, adults, strontium, consumed, tends, to, attach, only, to, the, surface, of, bones, but, in, children, strontium, can, replace, calcium, in, the, mineral, of, the, growing, bones, and, thus, lead, to, bone, growth, problems, the, biological, half, life, of, strontium, in, humans, has, variously, been, reported, as, from, 14, to, 600, days, 1, 000, days, 18, years, 30, years, and, at, an, upper, limit, 49, years, the, wide, ranging, published, biological, half, life, figures, are, explained, by, strontium, s, complex, metabolism, within, the, body, however, by, averaging, all, excretion, paths, the, overall, biological, half, life, is, estimated, to, be, about, 18, years, the, elimination, rate, of, strontium, is, strongly, affected, by, age, and, sex, due, to, differences, in, bone, metabolism, the, drug, strontium, ranelate, aids, bone, growth, increases, bone, density, and, lessens, the, incidence, of, vertebral, peripheral, and, hip, fractures, however, strontium, ranelate, also, increases, the, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, pulmonary, embolism, and, serious, cardiovascular, disorders, including, myocardial, infarction, its, use, is, therefore, now, restricted, its, beneficial, effects, are, also, questionable, since, the, increased, bone, density, is, partially, caused, by, the, increased, density, of, strontium, over, the, calcium, which, it, replaces, strontium, also, bioaccumulates, in, the, body, despite, restrictions, on, strontium, ranelate, strontium, is, still, contained, in, some, supplements, there, is, not, much, scientific, evidence, on, risks, of, strontium, chloride, when, taken, by, mouth, those, with, a, personal, or, family, history, of, blood, clotting, disorders, are, advised, to, avoid, strontium, strontium, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, sensory, irritation, when, applied, topically, to, the, skin, topically, applied, strontium, has, been, shown, to, accelerate, the, recovery, rate, of, the, epidermal, permeability, barrier, skin, barrier, strontium, 90, is, a, radioactive, fission, product, produced, by, nuclear, reactors, used, in, nuclear, power, it, is, a, major, component, of, high, level, radioactivity, of, nuclear, waste, and, spent, nuclear, fuel, its, 29, year, half, life, is, short, enough, that, its, decay, heat, has, been, used, to, power, arctic, lighthouses, but, long, enough, that, it, can, take, hundreds, of, years, to, decay, to, safe, levels, exposure, from, contaminated, water, and, food, may, increase, the, risk, of, leukemia, bone, cancer, and, primary, hyperparathyroidism, algae, has, shown, selectivity, for, strontium, in, studies, where, most, plants, used, in, bioremediation, have, not, shown, selectivity, between, calcium, and, strontium, often, becoming, saturated, with, calcium, which, is, greater, in, quantity, and, also, present, in, nuclear, waste, researchers, have, looked, at, the, bioaccumulation, of, strontium, by, scenedesmus, spinosus, algae, in, simulated, wastewater, the, study, claims, a, highly, selective, biosorption, capacity, for, strontium, of, s, spinosus, suggesting, that, it, may, be, appropriate, for, use, in, treating, nuclear, wastewater, a, study, of, the, pond, alga, closterium,
