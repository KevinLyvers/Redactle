earth, s, outer, core, is, a, fluid, layer, about, 2, 260, km, 1, 400, mi, thick, composed, of, mostly, iron, and, nickel, that, lies, above, earth, s, solid, inner, core, and, below, its, mantle, the, outer, core, begins, approximately, 2, 889, km, 1, 795, mi, beneath, earth, s, surface, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, and, ends, 5, 150, km, 3, 200, mi, beneath, earth, s, surface, at, the, inner, core, boundary, the, outer, core, of, earth, is, liquid, unlike, its, inner, core, which, is, solid, evidence, for, a, fluid, outer, core, includes, seismology, which, shows, that, seismic, shear, waves, are, not, transmitted, through, the, outer, core, although, having, a, composition, similar, to, earth, s, solid, inner, core, the, outer, core, remains, liquid, as, there, is, not, enough, pressure, to, keep, it, in, a, solid, state, seismic, inversions, of, body, waves, and, normal, modes, constrain, the, radius, of, the, outer, core, to, be, 3483, km, with, an, uncertainty, of, 5, km, while, that, of, the, inner, core, is, 1220, 10, km, 94, estimates, for, the, temperature, of, the, outer, core, are, about, 3, 000, 4, 500, k, 2, 700, 4, 200, c, 4, 900, 7, 600, f, in, its, outer, region, and, 4, 000, 8, 000, k, 3, 700, 7, 700, c, 6, 700, 14, 000, f, near, the, inner, core, modeling, has, shown, that, the, outer, core, because, of, its, high, temperature, is, a, low, viscosity, fluid, that, convects, turbulently, the, dynamo, theory, sees, eddy, currents, in, the, nickel, iron, fluid, of, the, outer, core, as, the, principal, source, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, average, magnetic, field, strength, in, earth, s, outer, core, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 5, millitesla, 50, times, stronger, than, the, magnetic, field, at, the, surface, as, earth, s, core, cools, the, liquid, at, the, inner, core, boundary, freezes, causing, the, solid, inner, core, to, grow, at, the, expense, of, the, outer, core, at, an, estimated, rate, of, 1, mm, per, year, this, is, approximately, 80, 000, tonnes, of, iron, per, second, earth, s, outer, core, cannot, be, entirely, constituted, of, iron, or, iron, nickel, alloy, because, their, densities, are, higher, than, geophysical, measurements, of, the, density, of, earth, s, outer, core, in, fact, earth, s, outer, core, is, approximately, 5, to, 10, percent, lower, density, than, iron, at, earth, s, core, temperatures, and, pressures, hence, it, has, been, proposed, that, light, elements, with, low, atomic, numbers, compose, part, of, earth, s, outer, core, as, the, only, feasible, way, to, lower, its, density, although, earth, s, outer, core, is, inaccessible, to, direct, sampling, the, composition, of, light, elements, can, be, meaningfully, constrained, by, high, pressure, experiments, calculations, based, on, seismic, measurements, models, of, earth, s, accretion, and, carbonaceous, chondrite, meteorite, comparisons, with, bulk, silicate, earth, bse, recent, estimates, are, that, earth, s, outer, core, is, composed, of, iron, along, with, 0, to, 0, 26, percent, hydrogen, 0, 2, percent, carbon, 0, 8, to, 5, 3, percent, oxygen, 0, to, 4, 0, percent, silicon, 1, 7, percent, sulfur, and, 5, percent, nickel, by, weight, and, the, temperature, of, the, core, mantle, boundary, and, the, inner, core, boundary, ranges, from, 4, 137, to, 4, 300, k, and, from, 5, 400, to, 6, 300, k, respectively, the, variety, of, light, elements, present, in, earth, s, outer, core, is, constrained, in, part, by, earth, s, accretion, namely, the, light, elements, contained, must, have, been, abundant, during, earth, s, formation, must, be, able, to, partition, into, liquid, iron, at, low, pressures, and, must, not, volatilize, and, escape, during, earth, s, accretionary, process, ci, chondritic, meteorites, are, believed, to, contain, the, same, planet, forming, elements, in, the, same, proportions, as, in, the, early, solar, system, so, differences, between, ci, meteorites, and, bse, can, provide, insights, into, the, light, element, composition, of, earth, s, outer, core, for, instance, the, depletion, of, silicon, in, bse, compared, to, ci, meteorites, may, indicate, that, silicon, was, absorbed, into, earth, s, core, however, a, wide, range, of, silicon, concentrations, in, earth, s, outer, and, inner, core, is, still, possible, tighter, constraints, on, the, concentrations, of, light, elements, in, earth, s, outer, core, would, provide, a, better, understanding, of, earth, s, accretion, and, core, formation, history, models, of, earth, s, accretion, could, be, better, tested, if, we, had, better, constraints, on, light, element, concentrations, in, earth, s, outer, core, for, example, accretionary, models, based, on, core, mantle, element, partitioning, tend, to, support, proto, earths, constructed, from, reduced, condensed, and, volatile, free, material, despite, the, possibility, that, oxidized, material, from, the, outer, solar, system, was, accreted, towards, the, conclusion, of, earth, s, accretion, if, we, could, better, constrain, the, concentrations, of, hydrogen, oxygen, and, silicon, in, earth, s, outer, core, models, of, earth, s, accretion, that, match, these, concentrations, would, presumably, better, constrain, earth, s, formation, the, depletion, of, siderophile, elements, in, earth, s, mantle, compared, to, chondritic, meteorites, is, attributed, to, metal, silicate, reactions, during, formation, of, earth, s, core, these, reactions, are, dependent, on, oxygen, silicon, and, sulfur, so, better, constraints, on, concentrations, of, these, elements, in, earth, s, outer, core, will, help, elucidate, the, conditions, of, formation, of, earth, s, core, in, another, example, the, possible, presence, of, hydrogen, in, earth, s, outer, core, suggests, that, the, accretion, of, earth, s, water, was, not, limited, to, the, final, stages, of, earth, s, accretion, and, that, water, may, have, been, absorbed, into, core, forming, metals, through, a, hydrous, magma, ocean, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, driven, by, thermal, convection, and, also, by, chemical, convection, the, exclusion, of, light, elements, from, the, inner, core, which, float, upward, within, the, fluid, outer, core, while, denser, elements, sink, this, chemical, convection, releases, gravitational, energy, that, is, then, available, to, power, the, geodynamo, that, produces, earth, s, magnetic, field, carnot, efficiencies, with, large, uncertainties, suggest, that, compositional, and, thermal, convection, contribute, about, 80, percent, and, 20, percent, respectively, to, the, power, of, earth, s, geodynamo, traditionally, it, was, thought, that, prior, to, the, formation, of, earth, s, inner, core, earth, s, geodynamo, was, mainly, driven, by, thermal, convection, however, recent, claims, that, the, thermal, conductivity, of, iron, at, core, temperatures, and, pressures, is, much, higher, than, previously, thought, imply, that, core, cooling, was, largely, by, conduction, not, convection, limiting, the, ability, of, thermal, convection, to, drive, the, geodynamo, this, conundrum, is, known, as, the, new, core, paradox, an, alternative, process, that, could, have, sustained, earth, s, geodynamo, requires, earth, s, core, to, have, initially, been, hot, enough, to, dissolve, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and, other, light, elements, as, the, earth, s, core, began, to, cool, it, would, become, supersaturated, in, these, light, elements, that, would, then, precipitate, into, the, lower, mantle, forming, oxides, leading, to, a, different, variant, of, chemical, convection, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, core, flow, is, essential, to, protect, life, from, interplanetary, radiation, and, prevent, the, atmosphere, from, dissipating, in, the, solar, wind, the, rate, of, cooling, by, conduction, and, convection, is, uncertain, but, one, estimate, is, that, the, core, would, not, be, expected, to, freeze, up, for, approximately, 91, billion, years, which, is, well, after, the, sun, is, expected, to, expand, sterilize, the, surface, of, the, planet, and, then, burn,
