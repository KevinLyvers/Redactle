a, mantle, is, a, layer, inside, a, planetary, body, bounded, below, by, a, core, and, above, by, a, crust, mantles, are, made, of, rock, or, ices, and, are, generally, the, largest, and, most, massive, layer, of, the, planetary, body, mantles, are, characteristic, of, planetary, bodies, that, have, undergone, differentiation, by, density, all, terrestrial, planets, including, earth, a, number, of, asteroids, and, some, planetary, moons, have, mantles, the, earth, s, mantle, is, a, layer, of, silicate, rock, between, the, crust, and, the, outer, core, its, mass, of, 4, 01, 10, 24, kg, is, 67, the, mass, of, the, earth, it, has, a, thickness, of, 2, 900, kilometres, 1, 800, mi, making, up, about, 84, of, earth, s, volume, it, is, predominantly, solid, but, in, geological, time, it, behaves, as, a, viscous, fluid, partial, melting, of, the, mantle, at, mid, ocean, ridges, produces, oceanic, crust, and, partial, melting, of, the, mantle, at, subduction, zones, produces, continental, crust, mercury, has, a, silicate, mantle, approximately, 490, kilometers, 300, miles, thick, constituting, only, 28, of, its, mass, venus, s, silicate, mantle, is, approximately, 2, 800, kilometers, 1, 700, miles, thick, constituting, around, 70, of, its, mass, mars, s, silicate, mantle, is, approximately, 1, 600, kilometers, 990, miles, thick, constituting, 74, 88, of, its, mass, and, may, be, represented, by, chassignite, meteorites, jupiter, s, moons, io, europa, and, ganymede, have, silicate, mantles, io, s, 1, 100, kilometers, 680, miles, silicate, mantle, is, overlain, by, a, volcanic, crust, ganymede, s, 1, 315, kilometers, 817, miles, thick, silicate, mantle, is, overlain, by, 835, kilometers, 519, miles, of, ice, and, europa, s, 1, 165, kilometers, 724, miles, km, silicate, mantle, is, overlain, by, 85, kilometers, 53, miles, of, ice, and, possibly, liquid, water, the, silicate, mantle, of, the, earth, s, moon, is, approximately, 1300, 1400, km, thick, and, is, the, source, of, mare, basalts, the, lunar, mantle, might, be, exposed, in, the, south, pole, aitken, basin, or, the, crisium, basin, the, lunar, mantle, contains, a, seismic, discontinuity, at, 500, kilometers, 310, miles, depth, most, likely, related, to, a, change, in, composition, titan, and, triton, each, have, a, mantle, made, of, ice, or, other, solid, volatile, substances, some, of, the, largest, asteroids, have, mantles, for, example, vesta, has, a, silicate, mantle, similar, in, composition, to, diogenite, meteorites
