a, carbonate, is, a, salt, of, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, characterized, by, the, presence, of, the, carbonate, ion, a, polyatomic, ion, with, the, formula, co, 2, 3, the, word, carbonate, may, also, refer, to, a, carbonate, ester, an, organic, compound, containing, the, carbonate, group, o, c, o, 2, the, term, is, also, used, as, a, verb, to, describe, carbonation, the, process, of, raising, the, concentrations, of, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, ions, in, water, to, produce, carbonated, water, and, other, carbonated, beverages, either, by, the, addition, of, carbon, dioxide, gas, under, pressure, or, by, dissolving, carbonate, or, bicarbonate, salts, into, the, water, in, geology, and, mineralogy, the, term, carbonate, can, refer, both, to, carbonate, minerals, and, carbonate, rock, which, is, made, of, chiefly, carbonate, minerals, and, both, are, dominated, by, the, carbonate, ion, co, 2, 3, carbonate, minerals, are, extremely, varied, and, ubiquitous, in, chemically, precipitated, sedimentary, rock, the, most, common, are, calcite, or, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, the, chief, constituent, of, limestone, as, well, as, the, main, component, of, mollusc, shells, and, coral, skeletons, dolomite, a, calcium, magnesium, carbonate, camg, co, 3, 2, and, siderite, or, iron, ii, carbonate, feco, 3, an, important, iron, ore, sodium, carbonate, soda, or, natron, na, 2, co, 3, and, potassium, carbonate, potash, k, 2, co, 3, have, been, used, since, antiquity, for, cleaning, and, preservation, as, well, as, for, the, manufacture, of, glass, carbonates, are, widely, used, in, industry, such, as, in, iron, smelting, as, a, raw, material, for, portland, cement, and, lime, manufacture, in, the, composition, of, ceramic, glazes, and, more, new, applications, of, alkali, metal, carbonates, include, thermal, energy, storage, catalysis, and, electrolyte, both, in, fuel, cell, technology, as, well, as, in, electrosynthesis, of, h, 2, o, 2, in, aqueous, media, the, carbonate, ion, is, the, simplest, oxocarbon, anion, it, consists, of, one, carbon, atom, surrounded, by, three, oxygen, atoms, in, a, trigonal, planar, arrangement, with, d, 3h, molecular, symmetry, it, has, a, molecular, mass, of, 60, 01, g, mol, and, carries, a, total, formal, charge, of, 2, it, is, the, conjugate, base, of, the, hydrogencarbonate, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, which, is, the, conjugate, base, of, h, 2, co, 3, carbonic, acid, the, lewis, structure, of, the, carbonate, ion, has, two, long, single, bonds, to, negative, oxygen, atoms, and, one, short, double, bond, to, a, neutral, oxygen, atom, this, structure, is, incompatible, with, the, observed, symmetry, of, the, ion, which, implies, that, the, three, bonds, are, the, same, length, and, that, the, three, oxygen, atoms, are, equivalent, as, in, the, case, of, the, isoelectronic, nitrate, ion, the, symmetry, can, be, achieved, by, a, resonance, among, three, structures, this, resonance, can, be, summarized, by, a, model, with, fractional, bonds, and, delocalized, charges, metal, carbonates, generally, decompose, on, heating, liberating, carbon, dioxide, leaving, behind, an, oxide, of, the, metal, this, process, is, called, calcination, after, calx, the, latin, name, of, quicklime, or, calcium, oxide, cao, which, is, obtained, by, roasting, limestone, in, a, lime, kiln, as, illustrated, by, its, affinity, for, ca, 2, carbonate, is, a, ligand, for, many, metal, cations, transition, metal, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, complexes, feature, metal, ions, covalently, bonded, to, carbonate, in, a, variety, of, bonding, modes, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and, ammonium, carbonates, are, water, soluble, salts, but, carbonates, of, 2, and, 3, ions, are, often, poorly, soluble, in, water, of, the, insoluble, metal, carbonates, caco, 3, is, important, because, in, the, form, of, scale, it, accumulates, in, and, impedes, flow, through, pipes, hard, water, is, rich, in, this, material, giving, rise, to, the, need, for, infrastructural, water, softening, acidification, of, carbonates, generally, liberates, carbon, dioxide, thus, scale, can, be, removed, with, acid, in, solution, the, equilibrium, between, carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon, dioxide, and, carbonic, acid, is, sensitive, to, ph, temperature, and, pressure, although, di, and, trivalent, carbonates, have, low, solubility, bicarbonate, salts, are, far, more, soluble, this, difference, is, related, to, the, disparate, lattice, energies, of, solids, composed, of, mono, vs, dianions, as, well, as, mono, vs, dications, in, aqueous, solution, carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon, dioxide, and, carbonic, acid, participate, in, a, dynamic, equilibrium, in, strongly, basic, conditions, the, carbonate, ion, predominates, while, in, weakly, basic, conditions, the, bicarbonate, ion, is, prevalent, in, more, acid, conditions, aqueous, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, aq, is, the, main, form, which, with, water, h, 2, o, is, in, equilibrium, with, carbonic, acid, the, equilibrium, lies, strongly, towards, carbon, dioxide, thus, sodium, carbonate, is, basic, sodium, bicarbonate, is, weakly, basic, while, carbon, dioxide, itself, is, a, weak, acid, in, organic, chemistry, a, carbonate, can, also, refer, to, a, functional, group, within, a, larger, molecule, that, contains, a, carbon, atom, bound, to, three, oxygen, atoms, one, of, which, is, double, bonded, these, compounds, are, also, known, as, organocarbonates, or, carbonate, esters, and, have, the, general, formula, r, o, c, o, o, r, or, rr, co, 3, important, organocarbonates, include, dimethyl, carbonate, the, cyclic, compounds, ethylene, carbonate, and, propylene, carbonate, and, the, phosgene, replacement, triphosgene, three, reversible, reactions, control, the, ph, balance, of, blood, and, act, as, a, buffer, to, stabilise, it, in, the, range, 7, 37, 7, 43, exhaled, co, 2, g, depletes, co, 2, aq, which, in, turn, consumes, h, 2, co, 3, causing, the, equilibrium, of, the, first, reaction, to, try, to, restore, the, level, of, carbonic, acid, by, reacting, bicarbonate, with, a, hydrogen, ion, an, example, of, le, ch, telier, s, principle, the, result, is, to, make, the, blood, more, alkaline, raise, ph, by, the, same, principle, when, the, ph, is, too, high, the, kidneys, excrete, bicarbonate, hco, 3, into, urine, as, urea, via, the, urea, cycle, or, krebs, henseleit, ornithine, cycle, by, removing, the, bicarbonate, more, h, is, generated, from, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, which, comes, from, co, 2, g, produced, by, cellular, respiration, crucially, a, similar, buffer, operates, in, the, oceans, it, is, a, major, factor, in, climate, change, and, the, long, term, carbon, cycle, due, to, the, large, number, of, marine, organisms, especially, coral, which, are, made, of, calcium, carbonate, increased, solubility, of, carbonate, through, increased, temperatures, results, in, lower, production, of, marine, calcite, and, increased, concentration, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, this, in, turn, increases, earth, temperature, the, amount, of, co, 2, 3, available, is, on, a, geological, scale, and, substantial, quantities, may, eventually, be, redissolved, into, the, sea, and, released, to, the, atmosphere, increasing, co, 2, levels, even, more, it, is, generally, thought, that, the, presence, of, carbonates, in, rock, is, strong, evidence, for, the, presence, of, liquid, water, recent, observations, of, the, planetary, nebula, ngc, 6302, show, evidence, for, carbonates, in, space, where, aqueous, alteration, similar, to, that, on, earth, is, unlikely, other, minerals, have, been, proposed, which, would, fit, the, observations, until, recently, carbonate, deposits, have, not, been, found, on, mars, via, remote, sensing, or, in, situ, missions, even, though, martian, meteorites, contain, small, amounts, groundwater, may, have, existed, at, gusev, and, meridiani, planum
