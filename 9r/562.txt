a, meteorite, is, a, rock, that, originated, in, outer, space, and, has, fallen, to, the, surface, of, a, planet, or, moon, when, the, original, object, enters, the, atmosphere, various, factors, such, as, friction, pressure, and, chemical, interactions, with, the, atmospheric, gases, cause, it, to, heat, up, and, radiate, energy, it, then, becomes, a, meteor, and, forms, a, fireball, also, known, as, a, shooting, star, astronomers, call, the, brightest, examples, bolides, once, it, settles, on, the, larger, body, s, surface, the, meteor, becomes, a, meteorite, meteorites, vary, greatly, in, size, for, geologists, a, bolide, is, a, meteorite, large, enough, to, create, an, impact, crater, meteorites, that, are, recovered, after, being, observed, as, they, transit, the, atmosphere, and, impact, the, earth, are, called, meteorite, falls, all, others, are, known, as, meteorite, finds, meteorites, have, traditionally, been, divided, into, three, broad, categories, stony, meteorites, that, are, rocks, mainly, composed, of, silicate, minerals, iron, meteorites, that, are, largely, composed, of, ferronickel, and, stony, iron, meteorites, that, contain, large, amounts, of, both, metallic, and, rocky, material, modern, classification, schemes, divide, meteorites, into, groups, according, to, their, structure, chemical, and, isotopic, composition, and, mineralogy, meteorites, less, than, 1, mm, in, diameter, are, classified, as, micrometeorites, however, micrometeorites, differ, from, meteorites, in, that, they, typically, melt, completely, in, the, atmosphere, and, fall, to, earth, as, quenched, droplets, extraterrestrial, meteorites, have, been, found, on, the, moon, and, on, mars, most, meteoroids, disintegrate, when, entering, the, earth, s, atmosphere, usually, five, to, ten, a, year, are, observed, to, fall, and, are, subsequently, recovered, and, made, known, to, scientists, few, meteorites, are, large, enough, to, create, large, impact, craters, instead, they, typically, arrive, at, the, surface, at, their, terminal, velocity, and, at, most, create, a, small, pit, large, meteoroids, may, strike, the, earth, with, a, significant, fraction, of, their, escape, velocity, second, cosmic, velocity, leaving, behind, a, hypervelocity, impact, crater, the, kind, of, crater, will, depend, on, the, size, composition, degree, of, fragmentation, and, incoming, angle, of, the, impactor, the, force, of, such, collisions, has, the, potential, to, cause, widespread, destruction, the, most, frequent, hypervelocity, cratering, events, on, the, earth, are, caused, by, iron, meteoroids, which, are, most, easily, able, to, transit, the, atmosphere, intact, examples, of, craters, caused, by, iron, meteoroids, include, barringer, meteor, crater, odessa, meteor, crater, wabar, craters, and, wolfe, creek, crater, iron, meteorites, are, found, in, association, with, all, of, these, craters, in, contrast, even, relatively, large, stony, or, icy, bodies, such, as, small, comets, or, asteroids, up, to, millions, of, tons, are, disrupted, in, the, atmosphere, and, do, not, make, impact, craters, although, such, disruption, events, are, uncommon, they, can, cause, a, considerable, concussion, to, occur, the, famed, tunguska, event, probably, resulted, from, such, an, incident, very, large, stony, objects, hundreds, of, meters, in, diameter, or, more, weighing, tens, of, millions, of, tons, or, more, can, reach, the, surface, and, cause, large, craters, but, are, very, rare, such, events, are, generally, so, energetic, that, the, impactor, is, completely, destroyed, leaving, no, meteorites, the, first, example, of, a, stony, meteorite, found, in, association, with, a, large, impact, crater, the, morokweng, impact, structure, in, south, africa, was, reported, in, may, 2006, several, phenomena, are, well, documented, during, witnessed, meteorite, falls, too, small, to, produce, hypervelocity, craters, the, fireball, that, occurs, as, the, meteoroid, passes, through, the, atmosphere, can, appear, to, be, very, bright, rivaling, the, sun, in, intensity, although, most, are, far, dimmer, and, may, not, even, be, noticed, during, the, daytime, various, colors, have, been, reported, including, yellow, green, and, red, flashes, and, bursts, of, light, can, occur, as, the, object, breaks, up, explosions, detonations, and, rumblings, are, often, heard, during, meteorite, falls, which, can, be, caused, by, sonic, booms, as, well, as, shock, waves, resulting, from, major, fragmentation, events, these, sounds, can, be, heard, over, wide, areas, with, a, radius, of, a, hundred, or, more, kilometers, whistling, and, hissing, sounds, are, also, sometimes, heard, but, are, poorly, understood, following, the, passage, of, the, fireball, it, is, not, unusual, for, a, dust, trail, to, linger, in, the, atmosphere, for, several, minutes, as, meteoroids, are, heated, during, atmospheric, entry, their, surfaces, melt, and, experience, ablation, they, can, be, sculpted, into, various, shapes, during, this, process, sometimes, resulting, in, shallow, thumbprint, like, indentations, on, their, surfaces, called, regmaglypts, if, the, meteoroid, maintains, a, fixed, orientation, for, some, time, without, tumbling, it, may, develop, a, conical, nose, cone, or, heat, shield, shape, as, it, decelerates, eventually, the, molten, surface, layer, solidifies, into, a, thin, fusion, crust, which, on, most, meteorites, is, black, on, some, achondrites, the, fusion, crust, may, be, very, light, colored, on, stony, meteorites, the, heat, affected, zone, is, at, most, a, few, mm, deep, in, iron, meteorites, which, are, more, thermally, conductive, the, structure, of, the, metal, may, be, affected, by, heat, up, to, 1, centimetre, 0, 39, in, below, the, surface, reports, vary, some, meteorites, are, reported, to, be, burning, hot, to, the, touch, upon, landing, while, others, are, alleged, to, have, been, cold, enough, to, condense, water, and, form, a, frost, meteoroids, that, disintegrate, in, the, atmosphere, may, fall, as, meteorite, showers, which, can, range, from, only, a, few, up, to, thousands, of, separate, individuals, the, area, over, which, a, meteorite, shower, falls, is, known, as, its, strewn, field, strewn, fields, are, commonly, elliptical, in, shape, with, the, major, axis, parallel, to, the, direction, of, flight, in, most, cases, the, largest, meteorites, in, a, shower, are, found, farthest, down, range, in, the, strewn, field, most, meteorites, are, stony, meteorites, classed, as, chondrites, and, achondrites, only, about, 6, of, meteorites, are, iron, meteorites, or, a, blend, of, rock, and, metal, the, stony, iron, meteorites, modern, classification, of, meteorites, is, complex, the, review, paper, of, krot, et, al, 2007, summarizes, modern, meteorite, taxonomy, about, 86, of, the, meteorites, are, chondrites, which, are, named, for, the, small, round, particles, they, contain, these, particles, or, chondrules, are, composed, mostly, of, silicate, minerals, that, appear, to, have, been, melted, while, they, were, free, floating, objects, in, space, certain, types, of, chondrites, also, contain, small, amounts, of, organic, matter, including, amino, acids, and, presolar, grains, chondrites, are, typically, about, 4, 55, billion, years, old, and, are, thought, to, represent, material, from, the, asteroid, belt, that, never, coalesced, into, large, bodies, like, comets, chondritic, asteroids, are, some, of, the, oldest, and, most, primitive, materials, in, the, solar, system, chondrites, are, often, considered, to, be, the, building, blocks, of, the, planets, about, 8, of, the, meteorites, are, achondrites, meaning, they, do, not, contain, chondrules, some, of, which, are, similar, to, terrestrial, igneous, rocks, most, achondrites, are, also, ancient, rocks, and, are, thought, to, represent, crustal, material, of, differentiated, planetesimals, one, large, family, of, achondrites, the, hed, meteorites, may, have, originated, on, the, parent, body, of, the, vesta, family, although, this, claim, is, disputed, others, derive, from, unidentified, asteroids, two, small, groups, of, achondrites, are, special, as, they, are, younger, and, do, not, appear, to, come, from, the, asteroid, belt, one, of, these, groups, comes, from, the, moon, and, includes, rocks, similar, to, those, brought, back, to, earth, by, apollo, and, luna, programs, the, other, group, is, almost, certainly, from, mars, and, constitutes, the, only, materials, from, other, planets, ever, recovered, by, humans, about, 5, of, meteorites, that, have, been, seen, to, fall, are, iron, meteorites, composed, of, iron, nickel, alloys, such, as, kamacite, and, or, taenite, most, iron, meteorites, are, thought, to, come, from, the, cores, of, planetesimals, that, were, once, molten, as, with, the, earth, the, denser, metal, separated, from, silicate, material, and, sank, toward, the, center, of, the, planetesimal, forming, its, core, after, the, planetesimal, solidified, it, broke, up, in, a, collision, with, another, planetesimal, due, to, the, low, abundance, of, iron, meteorites, in, collection, areas, such, as, antarctica, where, most, of, the, meteoric, material, that, has, fallen, can, be, recovered, it, is, possible, that, the, percentage, of, iron, meteorite, falls, is, lower, than, 5, this, would, be, explained, by, a, recovery, bias, laypeople, are, more, likely, to, notice, and, recover, solid, masses, of, metal, than, most, other, meteorite, types, the, abundance, of, iron, meteorites, relative, to, total, antarctic, finds, is, 0, 4, stony, iron, meteorites, constitute, the, remaining, 1, they, are, a, mixture, of, iron, nickel, metal, and, silicate, minerals, one, type, called, pallasites, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, boundary, zone, above, the, core, regions, where, iron, meteorites, originated, the, other, major, type, of, stony, iron, meteorites, is, the, mesosiderites, tektites, from, greek, tektos, molten, are, not, themselves, meteorites, but, are, rather, natural, glass, objects, up, to, a, few, centimeters, in, size, that, were, formed, according, to, most, scientists, by, the, impacts, of, large, meteorites, on, earth, s, surface, a, few, researchers, have, favored, tektites, originating, from, the, moon, as, volcanic, ejecta, but, this, theory, has, lost, much, of, its, support, over, the, last, few, decades, the, diameter, of, the, largest, impactor, to, hit, earth, on, any, given, day, is, likely, to, be, about, 40, centimeters, 16, inches, in, a, given, year, about, four, metres, 13, ft, and, in, a, given, century, about, 20, m, 66, ft, these, statistics, are, obtained, by, the, following, over, at, least, the, range, from, five, centimeters, 2, 0, inches, to, roughly, 300, meters, 980, feet, the, rate, at, which, earth, receives, meteors, obeys, a, power, law, distribution, as, follows, where, n, d, is, the, expected, number, of, objects, larger, than, a, diameter, of, d, meters, to, hit, earth, in, a, year, this, is, based, on, observations, of, bright, meteors, seen, from, the, ground, and, space, combined, with, surveys, of, near, earth, asteroids, above, 300, m, 980, ft, in, diameter, the, predicted, rate, is, somewhat, higher, with, a, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, asteroid, one, teraton, tnt, equivalent, every, couple, of, million, years, about, 10, times, as, often, as, the, power, law, extrapolation, would, predict, in, march, 2015, nasa, scientists, reported, that, complex, organic, compounds, found, in, dna, and, rna, including, uracil, cytosine, and, thymine, have, been, formed, in, the, laboratory, under, outer, space, conditions, using, starting, chemicals, such, as, pyrimidine, found, in, meteorites, pyrimidine, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, may, have, been, formed, in, red, giants, or, in, interstellar, dust, and, gas, clouds, according, to, the, scientists, in, january, 2018, researchers, found, that, 4, 5, billion, year, old, meteorites, found, on, earth, contained, liquid, water, along, with, prebiotic, complex, organic, substances, that, may, be, ingredients, for, life, in, november, 2019, scientists, reported, detecting, sugar, molecules, in, meteorites, for, the, first, time, including, ribose, suggesting, that, chemical, processes, on, asteroids, can, produce, some, organic, compounds, fundamental, to, life, and, supporting, the, notion, of, an, rna, world, prior, to, a, dna, based, origin, of, life, on, earth, in, april, 2022, a, japanese, group, reported, that, they, had, found, adenine, a, thymine, t, guanine, g, cytosine, c, and, uracil, u, inside, carbon, rich, meteorites, these, compounds, are, building, blocks, of, dna, and, rna, the, genetic, code, of, all, life, on, earth, these, compounds, have, also, occurred, spontaneously, in, laboratory, settings, emulating, conditions, in, outer, space, most, meteorites, date, from, the, early, solar, system, and, are, by, far, the, oldest, extant, material, on, earth, analysis, of, terrestrial, weathering, due, to, water, salt, oxygen, etc, is, used, to, quantify, the, degree, of, alteration, that, a, meteorite, has, experienced, several, qualitative, weathering, indices, have, been, applied, to, antarctic, and, desertic, samples, the, most, commonly, employed, weathering, scale, used, for, ordinary, chondrites, ranges, from, w0, pristine, state, to, w6, heavy, alteration, fossil, meteorites, are, sometimes, discovered, by, geologists, they, represent, the, highly, weathered, remains, of, meteorites, that, fell, to, earth, in, the, remote, past, and, were, preserved, in, sedimentary, deposits, sufficiently, well, that, they, can, be, recognized, through, mineralogical, and, geochemical, studies, the, thorsberg, limestone, quarry, in, sweden, has, produced, an, anomalously, large, number, exceeding, one, hundred, fossil, meteorites, from, the, ordovician, nearly, all, of, which, are, highly, weathered, l, chondrites, that, still, resemble, the, original, meteorite, under, a, petrographic, microscope, but, which, have, had, their, original, material, almost, entirely, replaced, by, terrestrial, secondary, mineralization, the, extraterrestrial, provenance, was, demonstrated, in, part, through, isotopic, analysis, of, relict, spinel, grains, a, mineral, that, is, common, in, meteorites, is, insoluble, in, water, and, is, able, to, persist, chemically, unchanged, in, the, terrestrial, weathering, environment, scientists, believe, that, these, meteorites, which, have, all, also, been, found, in, russia, and, china, all, originated, from, the, same, source, a, collision, that, occurred, somewhere, between, jupiter, and, mars, one, of, these, fossil, meteorites, dubbed, sterplana, 065, appears, to, represent, a, distinct, type, of, meteorite, that, is, extinct, in, the, sense, that, it, is, no, longer, falling, to, earth, the, parent, body, having, already, been, completely, depleted, from, the, reservoir, of, near, earth, objects, a, meteorite, fall, also, called, an, observed, fall, is, a, meteorite, collected, after, its, arrival, was, observed, by, people, or, automated, devices, any, other, meteorite, is, called, a, meteorite, find, there, are, more, than, 1, 100, documented, falls, listed, in, widely, used, databases, most, of, which, have, specimens, in, modern, collections, as, of, january, 2019, the, meteoritical, bulletin, database, had, 1, 180, confirmed, falls, most, meteorite, falls, are, collected, on, the, basis, of, eyewitness, accounts, of, the, fireball, or, the, impact, of, the, object, on, the, ground, or, both, therefore, despite, the, fact, that, meteorites, fall, with, virtually, equal, probability, everywhere, on, earth, verified, meteorite, falls, tend, to, be, concentrated, in, areas, with, higher, human, population, densities, such, as, europe, japan, and, northern, india, a, small, number, of, meteorite, falls, have, been, observed, with, automated, cameras, and, recovered, following, calculation, of, the, impact, point, the, first, of, these, was, the, p, bram, meteorite, which, fell, in, czechoslovakia, now, the, czech, republic, in, 1959, in, this, case, two, cameras, used, to, photograph, meteors, captured, images, of, the, fireball, the, images, were, used, both, to, determine, the, location, of, the, stones, on, the, ground, and, more, significantly, to, calculate, for, the, first, time, an, accurate, orbit, for, a, recovered, meteorite, following, the, p, bram, fall, other, nations, established, automated, observing, programs, aimed, at, studying, infalling, meteorites, one, of, these, was, the, prairie, network, operated, by, the, smithsonian, astrophysical, observatory, from, 1963, to, 1975, in, the, midwestern, us, this, program, also, observed, a, meteorite, fall, the, lost, city, chondrite, allowing, its, recovery, and, a, calculation, of, its, orbit, another, program, in, canada, the, meteorite, observation, and, recovery, project, ran, from, 1971, to, 1985, it, too, recovered, a, single, meteorite, innisfree, in, 1977, finally, observations, by, the, european, fireball, network, a, descendant, of, the, original, czech, program, that, recovered, p, bram, led, to, the, discovery, and, orbit, calculations, for, the, neuschwanstein, meteorite, in, 2002, nasa, has, an, automated, system, that, detects, meteors, and, calculates, the, orbit, magnitude, ground, track, and, other, parameters, over, the, southeast, usa, which, often, detects, a, number, of, events, each, night, until, the, twentieth, century, only, a, few, hundred, meteorite, finds, had, ever, been, discovered, more, than, 80, of, these, were, iron, and, stony, iron, meteorites, which, are, easily, distinguished, from, local, rocks, to, this, day, few, stony, meteorites, are, reported, each, year, that, can, be, considered, to, be, accidental, finds, the, reason, there, are, now, more, than, 30, 000, meteorite, finds, in, the, world, s, collections, started, with, the, discovery, by, harvey, h, nininger, that, meteorites, are, much, more, common, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, than, was, previously, thought, nininger, s, strategy, was, to, search, for, meteorites, in, the, great, plains, of, the, united, states, where, the, land, was, largely, cultivated, and, the, soil, contained, few, rocks, between, the, late, 1920s, and, the, 1950s, he, traveled, across, the, region, educating, local, people, about, what, meteorites, looked, like, and, what, to, do, if, they, thought, they, had, found, one, for, example, in, the, course, of, clearing, a, field, the, result, was, the, discovery, of, more, than, 200, new, meteorites, mostly, stony, types, in, the, late, 1960s, roosevelt, county, new, mexico, was, found, to, be, a, particularly, good, place, to, find, meteorites, after, the, discovery, of, a, few, meteorites, in, 1967, a, public, awareness, campaign, resulted, in, the, finding, of, nearly, 100, new, specimens, in, the, next, few, years, with, many, being, by, a, single, person, ivan, wilson, in, total, nearly, 140, meteorites, were, found, in, the, region, since, 1967, in, the, area, of, the, finds, the, ground, was, originally, covered, by, a, shallow, loose, soil, sitting, atop, a, hardpan, layer, during, the, dustbowl, era, the, loose, soil, was, blown, off, leaving, any, rocks, and, meteorites, that, were, present, stranded, on, the, exposed, surface, beginning, in, the, mid, 1960s, amateur, meteorite, hunters, began, scouring, the, arid, areas, of, the, southwestern, united, states, to, date, thousands, of, meteorites, have, been, recovered, from, the, mojave, sonoran, great, basin, and, chihuahuan, deserts, with, many, being, recovered, on, dry, lake, beds, significant, finds, include, the, three, tonne, old, woman, meteorite, currently, on, display, at, the, desert, discovery, center, in, barstow, california, and, the, franconia, and, gold, basin, meteorite, strewn, fields, hundreds, of, kilograms, of, meteorites, have, been, recovered, from, each, a, number, of, finds, from, the, american, southwest, have, been, submitted, with, false, find, locations, as, many, finders, think, it, is, unwise, to, publicly, share, that, information, for, fear, of, confiscation, by, the, federal, government, and, competition, with, other, hunters, at, published, find, sites, several, of, the, meteorites, found, recently, are, currently, on, display, in, the, griffith, observatory, in, los, angeles, and, at, ucla, s, meteorite, gallery, a, few, meteorites, were, found, in, antarctica, between, 1912, and, 1964, in, 1969, the, 10th, japanese, antarctic, research, expedition, found, nine, meteorites, on, a, blue, ice, field, near, the, yamato, mountains, with, this, discovery, came, the, realization, that, movement, of, ice, sheets, might, act, to, concentrate, meteorites, in, certain, areas, after, a, dozen, other, specimens, were, found, in, the, same, place, in, 1973, a, japanese, expedition, was, launched, in, 1974, dedicated, to, the, search, for, meteorites, this, team, recovered, nearly, 700, meteorites, shortly, thereafter, the, united, states, began, its, own, program, to, search, for, antarctic, meteorites, operating, along, the, transantarctic, mountains, on, the, other, side, of, the, continent, the, antarctic, search, for, meteorites, ansmet, program, european, teams, starting, with, a, consortium, called, euromet, in, the, 1990, 91, season, and, continuing, with, a, program, by, the, italian, programma, nazionale, di, ricerche, in, antartide, have, also, conducted, systematic, searches, for, antarctic, meteorites, the, antarctic, scientific, exploration, of, china, has, conducted, successful, meteorite, searches, since, 2000, a, korean, program, koreamet, was, launched, in, 2007, and, has, collected, a, few, meteorites, the, combined, efforts, of, all, of, these, expeditions, have, produced, more, than, 23, 000, classified, meteorite, specimens, since, 1974, with, thousands, more, that, have, not, yet, been, classified, for, more, information, see, the, article, by, harvey, 2003, at, about, the, same, time, as, meteorite, concentrations, were, being, discovered, in, the, cold, desert, of, antarctica, collectors, discovered, that, many, meteorites, could, also, be, found, in, the, hot, deserts, of, australia, several, dozen, meteorites, had, already, been, found, in, the, nullarbor, region, of, western, and, south, australia, systematic, searches, between, about, 1971, and, the, present, recovered, more, than, 500, others, 300, of, which, are, currently, well, characterized, the, meteorites, can, be, found, in, this, region, because, the, land, presents, a, flat, featureless, plain, covered, by, limestone, in, the, extremely, arid, climate, there, has, been, relatively, little, weathering, or, sedimentation, on, the, surface, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, allowing, meteorites, to, accumulate, without, being, buried, or, destroyed, the, dark, colored, meteorites, can, then, be, recognized, among, the, very, different, looking, limestone, pebbles, and, rocks, in, 1986, 87, a, german, team, installing, a, network, of, seismic, stations, while, prospecting, for, oil, discovered, about, 65, meteorites, on, a, flat, desert, plain, about, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, southeast, of, dirj, daraj, libya, a, few, years, later, a, desert, enthusiast, saw, photographs, of, meteorites, being, recovered, by, scientists, in, antarctica, and, thought, that, he, had, seen, similar, occurrences, in, northern, africa, in, 1989, he, recovered, about, 100, meteorites, from, several, distinct, locations, in, libya, and, algeria, over, the, next, several, years, he, and, others, who, followed, found, at, least, 400, more, meteorites, the, find, locations, were, generally, in, regions, known, as, regs, or, hamadas, flat, featureless, areas, covered, only, by, small, pebbles, and, minor, amounts, of, sand, dark, colored, meteorites, can, be, easily, spotted, in, these, places, in, the, case, of, several, meteorite, fields, such, as, dar, al, gani, dhofar, and, others, favorable, light, colored, geology, consisting, of, basic, rocks, clays, dolomites, and, limestones, makes, meteorites, particularly, easy, to, identify, although, meteorites, had, been, sold, commercially, and, collected, by, hobbyists, for, many, decades, up, to, the, time, of, the, saharan, finds, of, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, most, meteorites, were, deposited, in, or, purchased, by, museums, and, similar, institutions, where, they, were, exhibited, and, made, available, for, scientific, research, the, sudden, availability, of, large, numbers, of, meteorites, that, could, be, found, with, relative, ease, in, places, that, were, readily, accessible, especially, compared, to, antarctica, led, to, a, rapid, rise, in, commercial, collection, of, meteorites, this, process, was, accelerated, when, in, 1997, meteorites, coming, from, both, the, moon, and, mars, were, found, in, libya, by, the, late, 1990s, private, meteorite, collecting, expeditions, had, been, launched, throughout, the, sahara, specimens, of, the, meteorites, recovered, in, this, way, are, still, deposited, in, research, collections, but, most, of, the, material, is, sold, to, private, collectors, these, expeditions, have, now, brought, the, total, number, of, well, described, meteorites, found, in, algeria, and, libya, to, more, than, 500, meteorite, markets, came, into, existence, in, the, late, 1990s, especially, in, morocco, this, trade, was, driven, by, western, commercialization, and, an, increasing, number, of, collectors, the, meteorites, were, supplied, by, nomads, and, local, people, who, combed, the, deserts, looking, for, specimens, to, sell, many, thousands, of, meteorites, have, been, distributed, in, this, way, most, of, which, lack, any, information, about, how, when, or, where, they, were, discovered, these, are, the, so, called, northwest, africa, meteorites, when, they, get, classified, they, are, named, northwest, africa, abbreviated, nwa, followed, by, a, number, it, is, generally, accepted, that, nwa, meteorites, originate, in, morocco, algeria, western, sahara, mali, and, possibly, even, further, afield, nearly, all, of, these, meteorites, leave, africa, through, morocco, scores, of, important, meteorites, including, lunar, and, martian, ones, have, been, discovered, and, made, available, to, science, via, this, route, a, few, of, the, more, notable, meteorites, recovered, include, tissint, and, northwest, africa, 7034, tissint, was, the, first, witnessed, martian, meteorite, fall, in, more, than, fifty, years, nwa, 7034, is, the, oldest, meteorite, known, to, come, from, mars, and, is, a, unique, water, bearing, regolith, breccia, in, 1999, meteorite, hunters, discovered, that, the, desert, in, southern, and, central, oman, were, also, favorable, for, the, collection, of, many, specimens, the, gravel, plains, in, the, dhofar, and, al, wusta, regions, of, oman, south, of, the, sandy, deserts, of, the, rub, al, khali, had, yielded, about, 5, 000, meteorites, as, of, mid, 2009, included, among, these, are, a, large, number, of, lunar, and, martian, meteorites, making, oman, a, particularly, important, area, both, for, scientists, and, collectors, early, expeditions, to, oman, were, mainly, done, by, commercial, meteorite, dealers, however, international, teams, of, omani, and, european, scientists, have, also, now, collected, specimens, the, recovery, of, meteorites, from, oman, is, currently, prohibited, by, national, law, but, a, number, of, international, hunters, continue, to, remove, specimens, now, deemed, national, treasures, this, new, law, provoked, a, small, international, incident, as, its, implementation, preceded, any, public, notification, of, such, a, law, resulting, in, the, prolonged, imprisonment, of, a, large, group, of, meteorite, hunters, primarily, from, russia, but, whose, party, also, consisted, of, members, from, the, us, as, well, as, several, other, european, countries, meteorites, have, figured, into, human, culture, since, their, earliest, discovery, as, ceremonial, or, religious, objects, as, the, subject, of, writing, about, events, occurring, in, the, sky, and, as, a, source, of, peril, the, oldest, known, iron, artifacts, are, nine, small, beads, hammered, from, meteoritic, iron, they, were, found, in, northern, egypt, and, have, been, securely, dated, to, 3200, bc, although, the, use, of, the, metal, found, in, meteorites, is, also, recorded, in, myths, of, many, countries, and, cultures, where, the, celestial, source, was, often, acknowledged, scientific, documentation, only, began, in, the, last, few, centuries, meteorite, falls, may, have, been, the, source, of, cultish, worship, the, cult, in, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, possibly, originated, with, the, observation, and, recovery, of, a, meteorite, that, was, understood, by, contemporaries, to, have, fallen, to, the, earth, from, jupiter, the, principal, roman, deity, there, are, reports, that, a, sacred, stone, was, enshrined, at, the, temple, that, may, have, been, a, meteorite, the, black, stone, set, into, the, wall, of, the, kaaba, has, often, been, presumed, to, be, a, meteorite, but, the, little, available, evidence, for, this, is, inconclusive, some, native, americans, treated, meteorites, as, ceremonial, objects, in, 1915, a, 61, kilogram, 135, lb, iron, meteorite, was, found, in, a, sinagua, c, 1100, 1200, ad, burial, cyst, near, camp, verde, arizona, respectfully, wrapped, in, a, feather, cloth, a, small, pallasite, was, found, in, a, pottery, jar, in, an, old, burial, found, at, pojoaque, pueblo, new, mexico, nininger, reports, several, other, such, instances, in, the, southwest, us, and, elsewhere, such, as, the, discovery, of, native, american, beads, of, meteoric, iron, found, in, hopewell, burial, mounds, and, the, discovery, of, the, winona, meteorite, in, a, native, american, stone, walled, crypt, in, medieval, china, during, the, song, dynasty, a, meteorite, strike, event, was, recorded, by, shen, kuo, in, 1064, ad, near, changzhou, he, reported, a, loud, noise, that, sounded, like, a, thunder, was, heard, in, the, sky, a, giant, star, almost, like, the, moon, appeared, in, the, southeast, and, later, finding, the, crater, and, the, still, hot, meteorite, within, nearby, two, of, the, oldest, recorded, meteorite, falls, in, europe, are, the, elbogen, 1400, and, ensisheim, 1492, meteorites, the, german, physicist, ernst, florens, chladni, was, the, first, to, publish, in, 1794, the, idea, that, meteorites, might, be, rocks, that, originated, not, from, earth, but, from, space, his, booklet, was, on, the, origin, of, the, iron, masses, found, by, pallas, and, others, similar, to, it, and, on, some, associated, natural, phenomena, in, this, he, compiled, all, available, data, on, several, meteorite, finds, and, falls, concluded, that, they, must, have, their, origins, in, outer, space, the, scientific, community, of, the, time, responded, with, resistance, and, mockery, it, took, nearly, ten, years, before, a, general, acceptance, of, the, origin, of, meteorites, was, achieved, through, the, work, of, the, french, scientist, jean, baptiste, biot, and, the, british, chemist, edward, howard, biot, s, study, initiated, by, the, french, academy, of, sciences, was, compelled, by, a, fall, of, thousands, of, meteorites, on, 26, april, 1803, from, the, skies, of, l, aigle, france, throughout, history, many, first, and, second, hand, reports, speak, of, meteorites, killing, humans, and, other, animals, one, example, is, from, 1490, ad, in, china, which, purportedly, killed, thousands, of, people, john, lewis, has, compiled, some, of, these, reports, and, summarizes, no, one, in, recorded, history, has, ever, been, killed, by, a, meteorite, in, the, presence, of, a, meteoriticist, and, a, medical, doctor, and, reviewers, who, make, sweeping, negative, conclusions, usually, do, not, cite, any, of, the, primary, publications, in, which, the, eyewitnesses, describe, their, experiences, and, give, no, evidence, of, having, read, them, modern, reports, of, meteorite, strikes, include, meteorites, are, always, named, for, the, places, they, were, found, where, practical, usually, a, nearby, town, or, geographic, feature, in, cases, where, many, meteorites, were, found, in, one, place, the, name, may, be, followed, by, a, number, or, letter, e, g, allan, hills, 84001, or, dimmitt, b, the, name, designated, by, the, meteoritical, society, is, used, by, scientists, catalogers, and, most, collectors, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way,
