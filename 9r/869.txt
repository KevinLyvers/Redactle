because, of, this, the, pink, triangle, has, become, a, symbol, of, the, modern, gay, rights, movement, the, transition, to, pink, as, a, sexually, differentiating, color, for, girls, occurred, gradually, through, the, selective, process, of, the, marketplace, in, the, 1930s, and, 40s, in, the, 1920s, some, groups, had, described, pink, as, a, masculine, color, an, equivalent, to, red, which, was, considered, for, men, but, lighter, for, boys, but, stores, nonetheless, found, that, people, were, increasingly, choosing, to, buy, pink, for, girls, and, blue, for, boys, until, this, became, an, accepted, norm, in, the, 1940s, in, optics, the, word, pink, can, refer, to, any, of, the, pale, shades, of, colors, between, bluish, red, to, red, in, hue, of, medium, to, high, lightness, and, of, low, to, moderate, saturation, although, pink, is, generally, considered, a, tint, of, red, the, colors, of, most, tints, of, pink, are, slightly, bluish, and, lie, between, red, and, magenta, a, few, variations, of, pink, such, as, salmon, color, lean, toward, orange, as, a, ray, of, white, sunlight, travels, through, the, atmosphere, some, of, the, colors, are, scattered, out, of, the, beam, by, air, molecules, and, airborne, particles, this, is, called, rayleigh, scattering, colors, with, a, shorter, wavelength, such, as, blue, and, green, scatter, more, strongly, and, are, removed, from, the, light, that, finally, reaches, the, eye, at, sunrise, and, sunset, when, the, path, of, the, sunlight, through, the, atmosphere, to, the, eye, is, longest, the, blue, and, green, components, are, removed, almost, completely, leaving, the, longer, wavelength, orange, red, and, pink, light, the, remaining, pinkish, sunlight, can, also, be, scattered, by, cloud, droplets, and, other, relatively, large, particles, which, give, the, sky, above, the, horizon, a, pink, or, reddish, glow, raw, beef, is, red, because, the, muscles, of, vertebrate, animals, such, as, cows, and, pigs, contain, a, protein, called, myoglobin, which, binds, oxygen, and, iron, atoms, when, beef, is, cooked, the, myoglobin, proteins, undergo, oxidation, and, gradually, turn, from, red, to, pink, to, brown, that, is, from, rare, to, medium, to, well, done, pork, contains, less, myoglobin, than, beef, and, therefore, is, less, red, when, heated, it, changes, from, pinkish, red, to, less, pink, to, tan, or, white, ham, though, it, contains, myoglobins, like, beef, undergoes, a, different, transformation, traditional, hams, such, as, prosciutto, are, made, by, taking, the, hind, leg, or, thigh, of, a, pig, covering, it, with, sea, salt, which, removes, the, moisture, content, and, then, letting, it, dry, or, cure, for, as, long, as, two, years, the, salt, sodium, nitrate, permits, the, ham, to, retain, its, original, pink, color, even, when, dried, out, supermarket, hams, are, made, by, a, different, and, faster, process, they, are, brined, or, infused, with, a, salt, water, solution, containing, sodium, nitrite, which, transfers, nitric, oxide, which, bonds, with, the, myoglobin, to, form, the, traditional, pink, cured, ham, color, the, shells, and, flesh, of, crustaceans, such, as, crabs, lobsters, and, shrimp, contain, a, pink, carotenoid, pigment, called, astaxanthin, their, shells, naturally, blue, green, turn, pink, or, red, when, cooked, the, flesh, of, the, salmon, also, contains, astaxanthin, which, makes, it, pink, farm, bred, salmon, are, sometimes, fed, these, pigments, to, improve, their, pinkness, and, it, is, sometimes, also, used, to, enhance, the, color, of, egg, yolks, pink, is, one, of, the, most, common, colors, of, flowers, it, serves, to, attract, the, insects, and, birds, necessary, for, pollination, and, perhaps, also, to, deter, predators, the, color, comes, from, natural, pigments, called, anthocyanins, which, also, provide, the, pink, in, raspberries, in, the, 17th, century, the, word, pink, or, pinke, was, also, used, to, describe, a, yellowish, pigment, which, was, mixed, with, blue, colors, to, yield, greenish, colors, thomas, jenner, s, a, book, of, drawing, limning, washing, 1652, categorises, pink,

practice, in, europe, varied, from, country, to, country, with, some, assigning, colors, based, on, the, baby, s, complexion, and, others, assigning, pink, sometimes, to, boys, and, sometimes, to, girls, many, have, noted, the, contrary, association, of, pink, with, boys, in, 20th, century, america, an, article, in, the, trade, publication, earnshaw, s, infants, department, in, june, 1918, said, the, generally, accepted, rule, is, pink, for, the, boys, and, blue, for, the, girls, the, reason, is, that, pink, being, a, more, decided, and, stronger, color, is, more, suitable, for, the, boy, while, blue, which, is, more, delicate, and, dainty, is, prettier, for, the, girl, one, reason, for, the, increased, use, of, pink, for, girls, and, blue, for, boys, was, the, invention, of, new, chemical, dyes, which, meant, that, children, s, clothing, could, be, mass, produced, and, washed, in, hot, water, without, fading, prior, to, this, time, most, small, children, of, both, sexes, wore, white, which, could, be, frequently, washed, another, factor, was, the, popularity, of, blue, and, white, sailor, suits, for, young, boys, a, fashion, that, started, in, the, late, 19th, century, blue, was, also, the, usual, color, of, school, uniforms, for, boys, and, girls, blue, was, associated, with, seriousness, and, study, while, pink, was, associated, with, childhood, and, softness, by, the, 1950s, pink, was, strongly, associated, with, femininity, but, to, an, extent, that, was, neither, rigid, nor, universal, as, it, later, became, 92, one, study, by, two, neuroscientists, in, current, biology, examined, color, preferences, across, british, and, chinese, cultures, and, found, significant, differences, between, male, and, female, responses, both, groups, favored, blues, over, other, hues, but, women, had, more, favorable, responses, to, the, reddish, purple, range, of, the, spectrum, and, men, had, more, favorable, responses, to, the, greenish, yellow, middle, of, the, spectrum, despite, the, fact, that, the, study, used, adults, in, mainstream, cultures, and, both, groups, preferred, blues, and, responses, to, the, color, pink, were, never, even, tested, the, popular, press, represented, the, research, as, an, indication, of, an, innate, preference, by, girls, for, pink, the, misreading, has, been, often, repeated, in, market, research, reinforcing, american, culture, s, association, of, pink, with, girls, on, the, basis, of, imagined, innate, characteristics, 97, 8, as, of, 2008, various, feminist, groups, and, the, breast, cancer, awareness,

promote, awareness, of, the, disease, a, key, tactic, of, these, charities, is, encouraging, women, and, men, to, wear, pink, to, show, their, support, for, breast, cancer, awareness, and, research, pink, has, symbolized, a, welcome, embrace, in, india, and, masculinity, in, japan, toys, aimed, at, girls, often, display, pink, prominently, on, packaging, and, the, toy, themselves, this, is, a, relatively, recent, trend, with, toys, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1960s, not, being, gendered, by, color, though, they, were, gendered, by, a, focus, on, domesticity, and, nurturing, the, current, color, based, gendering, of, toys, can, be, traced, back, to, the, deregulation, of, children, s, television, programs, this, allowed, toy, companies, to, produce, shows, that, were, designed, specifically, to, sell, their, products, and, gender, was, an, important, differentiator, of, these, shows, and, the, toys, they, were, advertising, in, its, 1957, catalog, lionel, trains, offered, for, sale, a, pink, model, freight, train, for, girls, the, steam, locomotive, and, coal, car, were, pink, and, the, freight, cars, of, the, freight, train, were, various, pastel, colors, the, caboose, was, baby, blue, it, was, a, marketing, failure, because, any, girl, who, might, want, a, model, train, would, want, a, realistically, colored, train, while, boys, in, the, 1950s, did, not, want, to, be, seen, playing, with, a, pink, train, however, today, it, is, a, valuable, collector, s, item, as, noted, above, pink, combined, with, black, or, violet, is, commonly, associated, with, eroticism, and, seduction, pink, is, often, used, as, a, symbolic, color, by, groups, involved, in, issues, important, to, women, as, well, as, to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and, transgender, people,
