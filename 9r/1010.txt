an, elastic, modulus, also, known, as, modulus, of, elasticity, is, the, unit, of, measurement, of, an, object, s, or, substance, s, resistance, to, being, deformed, elastically, i, e, non, permanently, when, a, stress, is, applied, to, it, the, elastic, modulus, of, an, object, is, defined, as, the, slope, of, its, stress, strain, curve, in, the, elastic, deformation, region, a, stiffer, material, will, have, a, higher, elastic, modulus, an, elastic, modulus, has, the, form, where, stress, is, the, force, causing, the, deformation, divided, by, the, area, to, which, the, force, is, applied, and, strain, is, the, ratio, of, the, change, in, some, parameter, caused, by, the, deformation, to, the, original, value, of, the, parameter, since, strain, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, the, units, of, displaystyle, delta, will, be, the, same, as, the, units, of, stress, elastic, constants, are, specific, parameters, that, quantify, the, stiffness, of, a, material, in, response, to, applied, stresses, and, are, fundamental, in, defining, the, elastic, properties, of, materials, these, constants, form, the, elements, of, the, stiffness, matrix, in, tensor, notation, which, relates, stress, to, strain, through, linear, equations, in, anisotropic, materials, commonly, denoted, as, c, ijkl, where, i, j, k, and, l, are, the, coordinate, directions, these, constants, are, essential, for, understanding, how, materials, deform, under, various, loads, specifying, how, stress, and, strain, are, to, be, measured, including, directions, allows, for, many, types, of, elastic, moduli, to, be, defined, the, four, primary, ones, are, two, other, elastic, moduli, are, lam, s, first, parameter, and, p, wave, modulus, m, as, used, in, table, of, modulus, comparisons, given, below, references, homogeneous, and, isotropic, similar, in, all, directions, materials, solids, have, their, linear, elastic, properties, fully, described, by, two, elastic, moduli, and, one, may, choose, any, pair, given, a, pair, of, elastic, moduli, all, other, elastic, moduli, can, be, calculated, according, to, formulas, in, the, table, below, at, the, end, of, page, inviscid, fluids, are, special, in, that, they, cannot, support, shear, stress, meaning, that, the, shear, modulus, is, always, zero, this, also, implies, that, young, s, modulus, for, this, group, is, always, zero, in, some, texts, the, modulus, of, elasticity, is, referred, to, as, the, elastic, constant, while, the, inverse, quantity, is, referred, to, as, elastic, modulus, density, functional, theory, dft, provides, reliable, methods, for, determining, several, forms, of, elastic, moduli, that, characterise, distinct, features, of, a, material, s, reaction, to, mechanical, stresses, utilize, dft, software, such, as, vasp, quantum, espresso, or, abinit, overall, conduct, tests, to, ensure, that, results, are, independent, of, computational, parameters, such, as, the, density, of, the, k, point, mesh, the, plane, wave, cutoff, energy, and, the, size, of, the, simulation, cell, there, are, two, valid, solutions, the, plus, sign, leads, to, 0, displaystyle, nu, geq, 0
