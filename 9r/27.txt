a, year, is, the, time, taken, for, astronomical, objects, to, complete, one, orbit, for, example, a, year, on, earth, is, the, time, taken, for, earth, to, revolve, around, the, sun, generally, a, year, is, taken, to, mean, a, calendar, year, but, the, word, is, also, used, for, periods, loosely, associated, with, the, calendar, or, astronomical, year, such, as, the, seasonal, year, the, fiscal, year, the, academic, year, etc, the, term, can, also, be, used, in, reference, to, any, long, period, or, cycle, such, as, the, great, year, due, to, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, the, course, of, a, year, sees, the, passing, of, the, seasons, marked, by, changes, in, weather, the, hours, of, daylight, and, consequently, vegetation, and, soil, fertility, in, temperate, and, subpolar, regions, around, the, planet, four, seasons, are, generally, recognized, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, several, geographical, sectors, do, not, present, defined, seasons, but, in, the, seasonal, tropics, the, annual, wet, and, dry, seasons, are, recognized, and, tracked, a, calendar, year, is, an, approximation, of, the, number, of, days, of, the, earth, s, orbital, period, as, counted, in, a, given, calendar, the, gregorian, calendar, or, modern, calendar, presents, its, calendar, year, to, be, either, a, common, year, of, 365, days, or, a, leap, year, of, 366, days, as, do, the, julian, calendars, for, the, gregorian, calendar, the, average, length, of, the, calendar, year, the, mean, year, across, the, complete, leap, cycle, of, 400, years, is, 365, 2425, days, 97, out, of, 400, years, are, leap, years, in, english, the, unit, of, time, for, year, is, commonly, abbreviated, as, y, or, yr, the, symbol, a, for, latin, annus, year, is, sometimes, used, in, scientific, literature, though, its, exact, duration, may, be, inconsistent, english, year, via, west, saxon, ar, j, ar, anglian, r, continues, proto, germanic, j, ran, j, ran, cognates, are, german, jahr, old, high, german, j, r, old, norse, r, and, gothic, jer, from, the, proto, indo, european, noun, yeh, r, om, year, season, cognates, also, descended, from, the, same, proto, indo, european, noun, with, variation, in, suffix, ablaut, are, avestan, y, r, year, greek, h, ra, year, season, period, of, time, whence, hour, old, church, slavonic, jar, and, latin, hornus, of, this, year, latin, annus, a, 2nd, declension, masculine, noun, annum, is, the, accusative, singular, ann, is, genitive, singular, and, nominative, plural, ann, the, dative, and, ablative, singular, is, from, a, pie, noun, h, et, no, which, also, yielded, gothic, a, n, year, only, the, dative, plural, a, nam, is, attested, although, most, languages, treat, the, word, as, thematic, yeh, r, o, there, is, evidence, for, an, original, derivation, with, an, r, n, suffix, yeh, ro, both, indo, european, words, for, year, yeh, ro, and, h, et, no, would, then, be, derived, from, verbal, roots, meaning, to, go, move, h, ey, and, h, et, respectively, compare, vedic, sanskrit, ti, goes, atasi, thou, goest, wanderest, a, number, of, english, words, are, derived, from, latin, annus, such, as, annual, annuity, anniversary, etc, per, annum, means, each, year, ann, domin, means, in, the, year, of, the, lord, the, greek, word, for, year, is, cognate, with, latin, vetus, old, from, the, pie, word, wetos, year, also, preserved, in, this, meaning, in, sanskrit, vat, sa, ras, year, and, vat, sa, yearling, calf, the, latter, also, reflected, in, latin, vitulus, bull, calf, english, wether, ram, old, english, we, er, gothic, wi, rus, lamb, in, some, languages, it, is, common, to, count, years, by, referencing, to, one, season, as, in, summers, or, winters, or, harvests, examples, include, chinese, year, originally, an, ideographic, compound, of, a, person, carrying, a, bundle, of, wheat, denoting, harvest, slavic, besides, god, time, period, year, uses, l, to, summer, year, astronomical, years, do, not, have, an, integer, number, of, days, or, lunar, months, any, calendar, that, follows, an, astronomical, year, must, have, a, system, of, intercalation, such, as, leap, years, in, the, julian, calendar, the, average, mean, length, of, a, year, is, 365, 25, days, in, a, non, leap, year, there, are, 365, days, in, a, leap, year, there, are, 366, days, a, leap, year, occurs, every, fourth, year, during, which, a, leap, day, is, intercalated, into, the, month, of, february, the, name, leap, day, is, applied, to, the, added, day, in, astronomy, the, julian, year, is, a, unit, of, time, defined, as, 365, 25, days, each, of, exactly, 86, 400, seconds, si, base, unit, totaling, exactly, 31, 557, 600, seconds, in, the, julian, astronomical, year, the, revised, julian, calendar, proposed, in, 1923, and, used, in, some, eastern, orthodox, churches, has, 218, leap, years, every, 900, years, for, the, average, mean, year, length, of, 365, 242, 2222, days, close, to, the, length, of, the, mean, tropical, year, 365, 242, 19, days, relative, error, of, 9, 10, in, the, year, 2800, ce, the, gregorian, and, revised, julian, calendars, will, begin, to, differ, by, one, calendar, day, the, gregorian, calendar, aims, to, ensure, that, the, northward, equinox, falls, on, or, shortly, before, march, 21, and, hence, it, follows, the, northward, equinox, year, or, tropical, year, because, 97, out, of, 400, years, are, leap, years, the, mean, length, of, the, gregorian, calendar, year, is, 365, 242, 5, days, with, a, relative, error, below, one, ppm, 8, 10, relative, to, the, current, length, of, the, mean, tropical, year, 365, 242, 189, days, and, even, closer, to, the, current, march, equinox, year, of, 365, 242, 374, days, that, it, aims, to, match, historically, lunisolar, calendars, intercalated, entire, leap, months, on, an, observational, basis, lunisolar, calendars, have, mostly, fallen, out, of, use, except, for, liturgical, reasons, hebrew, calendar, various, hindu, calendars, a, modern, adaptation, of, the, historical, jalali, calendar, known, as, the, solar, hijri, calendar, 1925, is, a, purely, solar, calendar, with, an, irregular, pattern, of, leap, days, based, on, observation, or, astronomical, computation, aiming, to, place, new, year, nowruz, on, the, day, of, vernal, equinox, for, the, time, zone, of, tehran, as, opposed, to, using, an, algorithmic, system, of, leap, years, a, calendar, era, assigns, a, cardinal, number, to, each, sequential, year, using, a, reference, event, in, the, past, called, the, epoch, as, the, beginning, of, the, era, the, gregorian, calendar, era, is, the, world, s, most, widely, used, civil, calendar, its, epoch, is, a, 6th, century, estimate, of, the, date, of, birth, of, jesus, of, nazareth, two, notations, are, used, to, indicate, year, numbering, in, the, gregorian, calendar, the, christian, anno, domini, meaning, in, the, year, of, the, lord, abbreviated, ad, and, common, era, abbreviated, ce, preferred, by, many, of, other, faiths, and, none, year, numbers, are, based, on, inclusive, counting, so, that, there, is, no, year, zero, years, before, the, epoch, are, abbreviated, bc, for, before, christ, or, bce, for, before, the, common, era, in, astronomical, year, numbering, positive, numbers, indicate, years, ad, ce, the, number, 0, designates, 1, bc, bce, 1, designates, 2, bc, bce, and, so, on, other, eras, include, that, of, ancient, rome, ab, urbe, condita, from, the, foundation, of, the, city, abbreviated, auc, anno, mundi, year, of, the, world, used, for, the, hebrew, calendar, and, abbreviated, am, and, the, japanese, imperial, eras, the, islamic, hijri, year, year, of, the, hijrah, anno, hegirae, abbreviated, ah, is, a, lunar, calendar, of, twelve, lunar, months, and, thus, is, shorter, than, a, solar, year, financial, and, scientific, calculations, often, use, a, 365, day, calendar, to, simplify, daily, rates, a, fiscal, year, or, financial, year, is, a, 12, month, period, used, for, calculating, annual, financial, statements, in, businesses, and, other, organizations, in, many, jurisdictions, regulations, regarding, accounting, require, such, reports, once, per, twelve, months, but, do, not, require, that, the, twelve, months, constitute, a, calendar, year, for, example, in, canada, and, india, the, fiscal, year, runs, from, april, 1, in, the, united, kingdom, it, runs, from, april, 1, for, purposes, of, corporation, tax, and, government, financial, statements, but, from, april, 6, for, purposes, of, personal, taxation, and, payment, of, state, benefits, in, australia, it, runs, from, july, 1, while, in, the, united, states, the, fiscal, year, of, the, federal, government, runs, from, october, 1, an, academic, year, is, the, annual, period, during, which, a, student, attends, an, educational, institution, the, academic, year, may, be, divided, into, academic, terms, such, as, semesters, or, quarters, the, school, year, in, many, countries, starts, in, august, or, september, and, ends, in, may, june, or, july, in, israel, the, academic, year, begins, around, october, or, november, aligned, with, the, second, month, of, the, hebrew, calendar, some, schools, in, the, uk, canada, and, the, united, states, divide, the, academic, year, into, three, roughly, equal, length, terms, called, trimesters, or, quarters, in, the, united, states, roughly, coinciding, with, autumn, winter, and, spring, at, some, a, shortened, summer, session, sometimes, considered, part, of, the, regular, academic, year, is, attended, by, students, on, a, voluntary, or, elective, basis, other, schools, break, the, year, into, two, main, semesters, a, first, typically, august, through, december, and, a, second, semester, january, through, may, each, of, these, main, semesters, may, be, split, in, half, by, mid, term, exams, and, each, of, the, halves, is, referred, to, as, a, quarter, or, term, in, some, countries, there, may, also, be, a, voluntary, summer, session, or, a, short, january, session, some, other, schools, including, some, in, the, united, states, have, four, marking, periods, some, schools, in, the, united, states, notably, boston, latin, school, may, divide, the, year, into, five, or, more, marking, periods, some, state, in, defense, of, this, that, there, is, perhaps, a, positive, correlation, between, report, frequency, and, academic, achievement, there, are, typically, 180, days, of, teaching, each, year, in, schools, in, the, us, excluding, weekends, and, breaks, while, there, are, 190, days, for, pupils, in, state, schools, in, canada, new, zealand, and, the, united, kingdom, and, 200, for, pupils, in, australia, in, india, the, academic, year, normally, starts, from, june, 1, and, ends, on, may, 31, though, schools, start, closing, from, mid, march, the, actual, academic, closure, is, on, may, 31, and, in, nepal, it, starts, from, july, 15, schools, and, universities, in, australia, typically, have, academic, years, that, roughly, align, with, the, calendar, year, i, e, starting, in, february, or, march, and, ending, in, october, to, december, as, the, southern, hemisphere, experiences, summer, from, december, to, february, the, julian, year, as, used, in, astronomy, and, other, sciences, is, a, time, unit, defined, as, exactly, 365, 25, days, of, 86, 400, si, seconds, each, ephemeris, days, this, is, the, normal, meaning, of, the, unit, year, used, in, various, scientific, contexts, the, julian, century, of, 36, 525, ephemeris, days, and, the, julian, millennium, of, 365, 250, ephemeris, days, are, used, in, astronomical, calculations, fundamentally, expressing, a, time, interval, in, julian, years, is, a, way, to, precisely, specify, an, amount, of, time, not, how, many, real, years, for, long, time, intervals, where, stating, the, number, of, ephemeris, days, would, be, unwieldy, and, unintuitive, by, convention, the, julian, year, is, used, in, the, computation, of, the, distance, covered, by, a, light, year, in, the, unified, code, for, units, of, measure, but, not, according, to, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, physics, or, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, see, below, the, symbol, a, without, subscript, always, refers, to, the, julian, year, a, j, of, exactly, 31, 557, 600, seconds, the, si, multiplier, prefixes, may, be, applied, to, it, to, form, ka, ma, etc, each, of, these, three, years, can, be, loosely, called, an, astronomical, year, the, sidereal, year, is, the, time, taken, for, the, earth, to, complete, one, revolution, of, its, orbit, as, measured, against, a, fixed, frame, of, reference, such, as, the, fixed, stars, latin, sidera, singular, sidus, its, average, duration, is, 365, 256, 363, 004, days, 365, d, 6, h, 9, min, 9, 76, s, at, the, epoch, j2000, 0, january, 1, 2000, 12, 00, 00, tt, today, the, mean, tropical, year, is, defined, as, the, period, of, time, for, the, mean, ecliptic, longitude, of, the, sun, to, increase, by, 360, degrees, since, the, sun, s, ecliptic, longitude, is, measured, with, respect, to, the, equinox, the, tropical, year, comprises, a, complete, cycle, of, the, seasons, and, is, the, basis, of, solar, calendars, such, as, the, internationally, used, gregorian, calendar, the, modern, definition, of, mean, tropical, year, differs, from, the, actual, time, between, passages, of, e, g, the, northward, equinox, by, a, minute, or, two, for, several, reasons, explained, below, because, of, the, earth, s, axial, precession, this, year, is, about, 20, minutes, shorter, than, the, sidereal, year, the, mean, tropical, year, is, approximately, 365, days, 5, hours, 48, minutes, 45, seconds, using, the, modern, definition, 365, 24219, d, 86, 400, s, the, length, of, the, tropical, year, varies, a, bit, over, thousands, of, years, because, the, rate, of, axial, precession, is, not, constant, the, anomalistic, year, is, the, time, taken, for, the, earth, to, complete, one, revolution, with, respect, to, its, apsides, the, orbit, of, the, earth, is, elliptical, the, extreme, points, called, apsides, are, the, perihelion, where, the, earth, is, closest, to, the, sun, and, the, aphelion, where, the, earth, is, farthest, from, the, sun, the, anomalistic, year, is, usually, defined, as, the, time, between, perihelion, passages, its, average, duration, is, 365, 259636, days, 365, d, 6, h, 13, min, 52, 6, s, at, the, epoch, j2011, 0, the, draconic, year, draconitic, year, eclipse, year, or, ecliptic, year, is, the, time, taken, for, the, sun, as, seen, from, the, earth, to, complete, one, revolution, with, respect, to, the, same, lunar, node, a, point, where, the, moon, s, orbit, intersects, the, ecliptic, the, year, is, associated, with, eclipses, these, occur, only, when, both, the, sun, and, the, moon, are, near, these, nodes, so, eclipses, occur, within, about, a, month, of, every, half, eclipse, year, hence, there, are, two, eclipse, seasons, every, eclipse, year, the, average, duration, of, the, eclipse, year, is, this, term, is, sometimes, erroneously, used, for, the, draconic, or, nodal, period, of, lunar, precession, that, is, the, period, of, a, complete, revolution, of, the, moon, s, ascending, node, around, the, ecliptic, 18, 612, 815, 932, julian, years, 6, 798, 331, 019, days, at, the, epoch, j2000, 0, the, full, moon, cycle, is, the, time, for, the, sun, as, seen, from, the, earth, to, complete, one, revolution, with, respect, to, the, perigee, of, the, moon, s, orbit, this, period, is, associated, with, the, apparent, size, of, the, full, moon, and, also, with, the, varying, duration, of, the, synodic, month, the, duration, of, one, full, moon, cycle, is, the, lunar, year, comprises, twelve, full, cycles, of, the, phases, of, the, moon, as, seen, from, earth, it, has, a, duration, of, approximately, 354, 37, days, muslims, use, this, for, celebrating, their, eids, and, for, marking, the, start, of, the, fasting, month, of, ramadan, a, muslim, calendar, year, is, based, on, the, lunar, cycle, the, jewish, calendar, is, also, essentially, lunar, except, that, an, intercalary, lunar, month, is, added, once, every, two, or, three, years, in, order, to, keep, the, calendar, synchronized, with, the, solar, cycle, as, well, thus, a, lunar, year, on, the, jewish, hebrew, calendar, consists, of, either, twelve, or, thirteen, lunar, months, the, vague, year, from, annus, vagus, or, wandering, year, is, an, integral, approximation, to, the, year, equaling, 365, days, which, wanders, in, relation, to, more, exact, years, typically, the, vague, year, is, divided, into, 12, schematic, months, of, 30, days, each, plus, 5, epagomenal, days, the, vague, year, was, used, in, the, calendars, of, ethiopia, ancient, egypt, iran, armenia, and, in, mesoamerica, among, the, aztecs, and, maya, it, is, still, used, by, many, zoroastrian, communities, a, heliacal, year, is, the, interval, between, the, heliacal, risings, of, a, star, it, differs, from, the, sidereal, year, for, stars, away, from, the, ecliptic, due, mainly, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, sothic, year, is, the, heliacal, year, the, interval, between, heliacal, risings, of, the, star, sirius, it, is, currently, less, than, the, sidereal, year, and, its, duration, is, very, close, to, the, julian, year, of, 365, 25, days, the, gaussian, year, is, the, sidereal, year, for, a, planet, of, negligible, mass, relative, to, the, sun, and, unperturbed, by, other, planets, that, is, governed, by, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, such, a, planet, would, be, slightly, closer, to, the, sun, than, earth, s, mean, distance, its, length, is, the, besselian, year, is, a, tropical, year, that, starts, when, the, fictitious, mean, sun, reaches, an, ecliptic, longitude, of, 280, this, is, currently, on, or, close, to, january, 1, it, is, named, after, the, 19th, century, german, astronomer, and, mathematician, friedrich, bessel, the, following, equation, can, be, used, to, compute, the, current, besselian, epoch, in, years, the, tt, subscript, indicates, that, for, this, formula, the, julian, date, should, use, the, terrestrial, time, scale, or, its, predecessor, ephemeris, time, the, exact, length, of, an, astronomical, year, changes, over, time, numerical, value, of, year, variation, mean, year, lengths, in, this, section, are, calculated, for, 2000, and, differences, in, year, lengths, compared, to, 2000, are, given, for, past, and, future, years, in, the, tables, a, day, is, 86, 400, si, seconds, long, some, of, the, year, lengths, in, this, table, are, in, average, solar, days, which, are, slowly, getting, longer, at, a, rate, that, cannot, be, exactly, predicted, in, advance, and, are, now, around, 86, 400, 002, si, seconds, an, average, gregorian, year, may, be, said, to, be, 365, 2425, days, 52, 1775, weeks, and, if, an, hour, is, defined, as, one, twenty, fourth, of, a, day, 8, 765, 82, hours, 525, 949, 2, minutes, or, 31, 556, 952, seconds, note, however, that, in, absolute, time, the, average, gregorian, year, is, not, adequately, defined, unless, the, period, of, the, averaging, start, and, end, dates, is, stated, because, each, period, of, 400, years, is, longer, by, more, than, 1000, seconds, than, the, preceding, one, as, the, rotation, of, the, earth, slows, in, this, calendar, a, common, year, is, 365, days, 8760, hours, 525, 600, minutes, or, 31, 536, 000, seconds, and, a, leap, year, is, 366, days, 8784, hours, 527, 040, minutes, or, 31, 622, 400, seconds, the, 400, year, civil, cycle, of, the, gregorian, calendar, has, 146, 097, days, and, hence, exactly, 20, 871, weeks, the, great, year, or, equinoctial, cycle, corresponds, to, a, complete, revolution, of, the, equinoxes, around, the, ecliptic, its, length, is, about, 25, 700, years, the, galactic, year, is, the, time, it, takes, earth, s, solar, system, to, revolve, once, around, the, galactic, center, it, comprises, roughly, 230, million, earth, years, a, seasonal, year, is, the, time, between, successive, recurrences, of, a, seasonal, event, such, as, the, flooding, of, a, river, the, migration, of, a, species, of, bird, the, flowering, of, a, species, of, plant, the, first, frost, or, the, first, scheduled, game, of, a, certain, sport, all, of, these, events, can, have, wide, variations, of, more, than, a, month, from, year, to, year, a, common, symbol, for, the, year, as, a, unit, of, time, is, a, taken, from, the, latin, word, annus, for, example, the, u, s, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, guide, for, the, use, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, supports, the, symbol, a, as, the, unit, of, time, for, a, year, in, english, the, abbreviations, y, or, yr, are, more, commonly, used, in, non, scientific, literature, in, some, earth, sciences, branches, geology, and, paleontology, kyr, myr, byr, thousands, millions, and, billions, of, years, respectively, and, similar, abbreviations, are, used, to, denote, intervals, of, time, remote, from, the, present, in, astronomy, the, abbreviations, kyr, myr, and, gyr, are, in, common, use, for, kiloyears, megayears, and, gigayears, the, unified, code, for, units, of, measure, ucum, disambiguates, the, varying, symbologies, of, iso, 1000, iso, 2955, and, ansi, x3, 50, by, using, in, the, ucum, the, symbol, a, without, any, qualifier, equals, 1, a, j, the, ucum, also, minimizes, confusion, with, are, a, unit, of, area, by, using, the, abbreviation, ar, since, 1989, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, recognizes, the, symbol, a, rather, than, yr, for, a, year, notes, the, different, kinds, of, year, and, recommends, adopting, the, julian, year, of, 365, 25, days, unless, otherwise, specified, iau, style, manual, since, 1987, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, physics, iupap, notes, a, as, the, general, symbol, for, the, time, unit, year, iupap, red, book, since, 1993, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, green, book, also, uses, the, same, symbol, a, notes, the, difference, between, gregorian, year, and, julian, year, and, adopts, the, former, a, 365, 2425, days, also, noted, in, the, iupac, gold, book, in, 2011, the, iupac, and, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, jointly, recommended, defining, the, annus, with, symbol, a, as, the, length, of, the, tropical, year, in, the, year, 2000, this, differs, from, the, above, definition, of, 365, 25, days, by, about, 20, parts, per, million, the, joint, document, says, that, definitions, such, as, the, julian, year, bear, an, inherent, pre, programmed, obsolescence, because, of, the, variability, of, earth, s, orbital, movement, but, then, proposes, using, the, length, of, the, tropical, year, as, of, 2000, ad, specified, down, to, the, millisecond, which, suffers, from, the, same, problem, the, tropical, year, oscillates, with, time, by, more, than, a, minute, the, notation, has, proved, controversial, as, it, conflicts, with, an, earlier, convention, among, geoscientists, to, use, a, specifically, for, years, ago, e, g, 1, ma, for, 1, million, years, ago, and, y, or, yr, for, a, one,
