in, electromagnetism, a, dielectric, or, dielectric, medium, is, an, electrical, insulator, that, can, be, polarised, by, an, applied, electric, field, when, a, dielectric, material, is, placed, in, an, electric, field, electric, charges, do, not, flow, through, the, material, as, they, do, in, an, electrical, conductor, because, they, have, no, loosely, bound, or, free, electrons, that, may, drift, through, the, material, but, instead, they, shift, only, slightly, from, their, average, equilibrium, positions, causing, dielectric, polarisation, because, of, dielectric, polarisation, positive, charges, are, displaced, in, the, direction, of, the, field, and, negative, charges, shift, in, the, direction, opposite, to, the, field, this, creates, an, internal, electric, field, that, reduces, the, overall, field, within, the, dielectric, itself, if, a, dielectric, is, composed, of, weakly, bonded, molecules, those, molecules, not, only, become, polarised, but, also, reorient, so, that, their, symmetry, axes, align, to, the, field, the, study, of, dielectric, properties, concerns, storage, and, dissipation, of, electric, and, magnetic, energy, in, materials, dielectrics, are, important, for, explaining, various, phenomena, in, electronics, optics, solid, state, physics, and, cell, biophysics, although, the, term, insulator, implies, low, electrical, conduction, dielectric, typically, means, materials, with, a, high, polarisability, the, latter, is, expressed, by, a, number, called, the, relative, permittivity, insulator, is, generally, used, to, indicate, electrical, obstruction, while, dielectric, is, used, to, indicate, the, energy, storing, capacity, of, the, material, by, means, of, polarisation, a, common, example, of, a, dielectric, is, the, electrically, insulating, material, between, the, metallic, plates, of, a, capacitor, the, polarisation, of, the, dielectric, by, the, applied, electric, field, increases, the, capacitor, s, surface, charge, for, the, given, electric, field, strength, the, term, dielectric, was, coined, by, william, whewell, from, dia, electric, in, response, to, a, request, from, michael, faraday, a, perfect, dielectric, is, a, material, with, zero, electrical, conductivity, cf, perfect, conductor, infinite, electrical, conductivity, thus, exhibiting, only, a, displacement, current, therefore, it, stores, and, returns, electrical, energy, as, if, it, were, an, ideal, capacitor, the, electric, susceptibility, e, displaystyle, chi, e, of, a, dielectric, material, is, a, measure, of, how, easily, it, polarises, in, response, to, an, electric, field, this, in, turn, determines, the, electric, permittivity, of, the, material, and, thus, influences, many, other, phenomena, in, that, medium, from, the, capacitance, of, capacitors, to, the, speed, of, light, it, is, defined, as, the, constant, of, proportionality, which, may, be, a, tensor, relating, an, electric, field, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, to, the, induced, dielectric, polarisation, density, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, such, that, p, 0, e, e, displaystyle, mathbf, p, varepsilon, 0, chi, e, mathbf, e, where, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, 0, is, the, electric, permittivity, of, free, space, the, susceptibility, of, a, medium, is, related, to, its, relative, permittivity, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, by, e, r, 1, displaystyle, chi, e, varepsilon, r, 1, so, in, the, case, of, a, classical, vacuum, e, 0, displaystyle, chi, e, 0, the, electric, displacement, d, displaystyle, mathbf, d, is, related, to, the, polarisation, density, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, by, d, 0, e, p, 0, 1, e, e, 0, r, e, displaystyle, mathbf, d, varepsilon, 0, mathbf, e, mathbf, p, varepsilon, 0, left, 1, chi, e, right, mathbf, e, varepsilon, 0, varepsilon, r, mathbf, e, in, general, a, material, cannot, polarise, instantaneously, in, response, to, an, applied, field, the, more, general, formulation, as, a, function, of, time, is, p, t, 0, t, e, t, t, e, t, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, p, t, varepsilon, 0, int, infty, t, chi, e, left, t, t, right, mathbf, e, t, dt, that, is, the, polarisation, is, a, convolution, of, the, electric, field, at, previous, times, with, time, dependent, susceptibility, given, by, e, t, displaystyle, chi, e, delta, t, the, upper, limit, of, this, integral, can, be, extended, to, infinity, as, well, if, one, defines, e, t, 0, displaystyle, chi, e, delta, t, 0, for, t, 0, displaystyle, delta, t, 0, an, instantaneous, response, corresponds, to, dirac, delta, function, susceptibility, e, t, e, t, displaystyle, chi, e, delta, t, chi, e, delta, delta, t, it, is, more, convenient, in, a, linear, system, to, take, the, fourier, transform, and, write, this, relationship, as, a, function, of, frequency, due, to, the, convolution, theorem, the, integral, becomes, a, simple, product, p, 0, e, e, displaystyle, mathbf, p, omega, varepsilon, 0, chi, e, omega, mathbf, e, omega, the, susceptibility, or, equivalently, the, permittivity, is, frequency, dependent, the, change, of, susceptibility, with, respect, to, frequency, characterises, the, dispersion, properties, of, the, material, moreover, the, fact, that, the, polarisation, can, only, depend, on, the, electric, field, at, previous, times, i, e, e, t, 0, displaystyle, chi, e, delta, t, 0, for, t, 0, displaystyle, delta, t, 0, a, consequence, of, causality, imposes, kramers, kronig, constraints, on, the, real, and, imaginary, parts, of, the, susceptibility, e, displaystyle, chi, e, omega, in, the, classical, approach, to, the, dielectric, the, material, is, made, up, of, atoms, each, atom, consists, of, a, cloud, of, negative, charge, electrons, bound, to, and, surrounding, a, positive, point, charge, at, its, center, in, the, presence, of, an, electric, field, the, charge, cloud, is, distorted, as, shown, in, the, top, right, of, the, figure, this, can, be, reduced, to, a, simple, dipole, using, the, superposition, principle, a, dipole, is, characterised, by, its, dipole, moment, a, vector, quantity, shown, in, the, figure, as, the, blue, arrow, labeled, m, it, is, the, relationship, between, the, electric, field, and, the, dipole, moment, that, gives, rise, to, the, behaviour, of, the, dielectric, note, that, the, dipole, moment, points, in, the, same, direction, as, the, electric, field, in, the, figure, this, is, not, always, the, case, and, is, a, major, simplification, but, is, true, for, many, materials, when, the, electric, field, is, removed, the, atom, returns, to, its, original, state, the, time, required, to, do, so, is, called, relaxation, time, an, exponential, decay, this, is, the, essence, of, the, model, in, physics, the, behaviour, of, the, dielectric, now, depends, on, the, situation, the, more, complicated, the, situation, the, richer, the, model, must, be, to, accurately, describe, the, behaviour, important, questions, are, the, relationship, between, the, electric, field, e, and, the, dipole, moment, m, gives, rise, to, the, behaviour, of, the, dielectric, which, for, a, given, material, can, be, characterised, by, the, function, f, defined, by, the, equation, m, f, e, displaystyle, mathbf, m, mathbf, f, mathbf, e, when, both, the, type, of, electric, field, and, the, type, of, material, have, been, defined, one, then, chooses, the, simplest, function, f, that, correctly, predicts, the, phenomena, of, interest, examples, of, phenomena, that, can, be, so, modelled, include, dipolar, polarisation, is, a, polarisation, that, is, either, inherent, to, polar, molecules, orientation, polarisation, or, can, be, induced, in, any, molecule, in, which, the, asymmetric, distortion, of, the, nuclei, is, possible, distortion, polarisation, orientation, polarisation, results, from, a, permanent, dipole, e, g, that, arises, from, the, 104, 45, angle, between, the, asymmetric, bonds, between, oxygen, and, hydrogen, atoms, in, the, water, molecule, which, retains, polarisation, in, the, absence, of, an, external, electric, field, the, assembly, of, these, dipoles, forms, a, macroscopic, polarisation, when, an, external, electric, field, is, applied, the, distance, between, charges, within, each, permanent, dipole, which, is, related, to, chemical, bonding, remains, constant, in, orientation, polarisation, however, the, direction, of, polarisation, itself, rotates, this, rotation, occurs, on, a, timescale, that, depends, on, the, torque, and, surrounding, local, viscosity, of, the, molecules, because, the, rotation, is, not, instantaneous, dipolar, polarisations, lose, the, response, to, electric, fields, at, the, highest, frequencies, a, molecule, rotates, about, 1, radian, per, picosecond, in, a, fluid, thus, this, loss, occurs, at, about, 10, 11, hz, in, the, microwave, region, the, delay, of, the, response, to, the, change, of, the, electric, field, causes, friction, and, heat, when, an, external, electric, field, is, applied, at, infrared, frequencies, or, less, the, molecules, are, bent, and, stretched, by, the, field, and, the, molecular, dipole, moment, changes, the, molecular, vibration, frequency, is, roughly, the, inverse, of, the, time, it, takes, for, the, molecules, to, bend, and, this, distortion, polarisation, disappears, above, the, infrared, ionic, polarisation, is, polarisation, caused, by, relative, displacements, between, positive, and, negative, ions, in, ionic, crystals, for, example, nacl, if, a, crystal, or, molecule, consists, of, atoms, of, more, than, one, kind, the, distribution, of, charges, around, an, atom, in, the, crystal, or, molecule, leans, to, positive, or, negative, as, a, result, when, lattice, vibrations, or, molecular, vibrations, induce, relative, displacements, of, the, atoms, the, centers, of, positive, and, negative, charges, are, also, displaced, the, locations, of, these, centers, are, affected, by, the, symmetry, of, the, displacements, when, the, centers, do, not, correspond, polarisation, arises, in, molecules, or, crystals, this, polarisation, is, called, ionic, polarisation, ionic, polarisation, causes, the, ferroelectric, effect, as, well, as, dipolar, polarisation, the, ferroelectric, transition, which, is, caused, by, the, lining, up, of, the, orientations, of, permanent, dipoles, along, a, particular, direction, is, called, an, order, disorder, phase, transition, the, transition, caused, by, ionic, polarisations, in, crystals, is, called, a, displacive, phase, transition, ionic, polarisation, enables, the, production, of, energy, rich, compounds, in, cells, the, proton, pump, in, mitochondria, and, at, the, plasma, membrane, the, establishment, of, the, resting, potential, energetically, unfavourable, transport, of, ions, and, cell, to, cell, communication, the, na, k, atpase, all, cells, in, animal, body, tissues, are, electrically, polarised, in, other, words, they, maintain, a, voltage, difference, across, the, cell, s, plasma, membrane, known, as, the, membrane, potential, this, electrical, polarisation, results, from, a, complex, interplay, between, ion, transporters, and, ion, channels, in, neurons, the, types, of, ion, channels, in, the, membrane, usually, vary, across, different, parts, of, the, cell, giving, the, dendrites, axon, and, cell, body, different, electrical, properties, as, a, result, some, parts, of, the, membrane, of, a, neuron, may, be, excitable, capable, of, generating, action, potentials, whereas, others, are, not, in, physics, dielectric, dispersion, is, the, dependence, of, the, permittivity, of, a, dielectric, material, on, the, frequency, of, an, applied, electric, field, because, there, is, a, lag, between, changes, in, polarisation, and, changes, in, the, electric, field, the, permittivity, of, the, dielectric, is, a, complex, function, of, the, frequency, of, the, electric, field, dielectric, dispersion, is, very, important, for, the, applications, of, dielectric, materials, and, the, analysis, of, polarisation, systems, this, is, one, instance, of, a, general, phenomenon, known, as, material, dispersion, a, frequency, dependent, response, of, a, medium, for, wave, propagation, when, the, frequency, becomes, higher, in, the, frequency, region, above, ultraviolet, permittivity, approaches, the, constant, 0, in, every, substance, where, 0, is, the, permittivity, of, the, free, space, because, permittivity, indicates, the, strength, of, the, relation, between, an, electric, field, and, polarisation, if, a, polarisation, process, loses, its, response, permittivity, decreases, dielectric, relaxation, is, the, momentary, delay, or, lag, in, the, dielectric, constant, of, a, material, this, is, usually, caused, by, the, delay, in, molecular, polarisation, with, respect, to, a, changing, electric, field, in, a, dielectric, medium, e, g, inside, capacitors, or, between, two, large, conducting, surfaces, dielectric, relaxation, in, changing, electric, fields, could, be, considered, analogous, to, hysteresis, in, changing, magnetic, fields, e, g, in, inductor, or, transformer, cores, relaxation, in, general, is, a, delay, or, lag, in, the, response, of, a, linear, system, and, therefore, dielectric, relaxation, is, measured, relative, to, the, expected, linear, steady, state, equilibrium, dielectric, values, the, time, lag, between, electrical, field, and, polarisation, implies, an, irreversible, degradation, of, gibbs, free, energy, in, physics, dielectric, relaxation, refers, to, the, relaxation, response, of, a, dielectric, medium, to, an, external, oscillating, electric, field, this, relaxation, is, often, described, in, terms, of, permittivity, as, a, function, of, frequency, which, can, for, ideal, systems, be, described, by, the, debye, equation, on, the, other, hand, the, distortion, related, to, ionic, and, electronic, polarisation, shows, behaviour, of, the, resonance, or, oscillator, type, the, character, of, the, distortion, process, depends, on, the, structure, composition, and, surroundings, of, the, sample, debye, relaxation, is, the, dielectric, relaxation, response, of, an, ideal, noninteracting, population, of, dipoles, to, an, alternating, external, electric, field, it, is, usually, expressed, in, the, complex, permittivity, of, a, medium, as, a, function, of, the, field, s, angular, frequency, 1, i, displaystyle, hat, varepsilon, omega, varepsilon, infty, frac, delta, varepsilon, 1, i, omega, tau, where, is, the, permittivity, at, the, high, frequency, limit, s, where, s, is, the, static, low, frequency, permittivity, and, is, the, characteristic, relaxation, time, of, the, medium, separating, into, the, real, part, displaystyle, varepsilon, and, the, imaginary, part, displaystyle, varepsilon, of, the, complex, dielectric, permittivity, yields, s, 1, 2, 2, s, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, begin, aligned,

that, the, above, equation, for, displaystyle, hat, varepsilon, omega, is, sometimes, written, with, 1, i, displaystyle, 1, i, omega, tau, in, the, denominator, due, to, an, ongoing, sign, convention, ambiguity, whereby, many, sources, represent, the, time, dependence, of, the, complex, electric, field, with, exp, i, t, displaystyle, exp, i, omega, t, whereas, others, use, exp, i, t, displaystyle, exp, i, omega, t, in, the, former, convention, the, functions, displaystyle, varepsilon, and, displaystyle, varepsilon, representing, real, and, imaginary, parts, are, given, by, i, displaystyle, hat, varepsilon, omega, varepsilon, i, varepsilon, whereas, in, the, latter, convention, i, displaystyle, hat, varepsilon, omega, varepsilon, i, varepsilon, the, above, equation, uses, the, latter,

dynamic, polarisation, with, only, one, relaxation, time, paraelectricity, is, the, nominal, behaviour, of, dielectrics, when, the, dielectric, permittivity, tensor, is, proportional, to, the, unit, matrix, i, e, an, applied, electric, field, causes, polarisation, and, or, alignment, of, dipoles, only, parallel, to, the, applied, electric, field, contrary, to, the, analogy, with, a, paramagnetic, material, no, permanent, electric, dipole, needs, to, exist, in, a, paraelectric, material, removal, of, the, fields, results, in, the, dipolar, polarisation, returning, to, zero, the, mechanisms, that, causes, paraelectric, behaviour, are, distortion, of, individual, ions, displacement, of, the, electron, cloud, from, the, nucleus, and, polarisation, of, molecules, or, combinations, of, ions, or, defects, paraelectricity, can, occur, in, crystal, phases, where, electric, dipoles, are, unaligned, and, thus, have, the, potential, to, align, in, an, external, electric, field, and, weaken, it, most, dielectric, materials, are, paraelectrics, a, specific, example, of, a, paraelectric, material, of, high, dielectric, constant, is, strontium, titanate, the, linbo, 3, crystal, is, ferroelectric, below, 1430, k, and, above, this, temperature, it, transforms, into, a, disordered, paraelectric, phase, similarly, other, perovskites, also, exhibit, paraelectricity, at, high, temperatures, paraelectricity, has, been, explored, as, a, possible, refrigeration, mechanism, polarising, a, paraelectric, by, applying, an, electric, field, under, adiabatic, process, conditions, raises, the, temperature, while, removing, the, field, lowers, the, temperature, a, heat, pump, that, operates, by, polarising, the, paraelectric, allowing, it, to, return, to, ambient, temperature, by, dissipating, the, extra, heat, bringing, it, into, contact, with, the, object, to, be, cooled, and, finally, depolarising, it, would, result, in, refrigeration, tunable, dielectrics, are, insulators, whose, ability, to, store, electrical, charge, changes, when, a, voltage, is, applied, generally, strontium, titanate, srtio, 3, is, used, for, devices, operating, at, low, temperatures, while, barium, strontium, titanate, ba, 1, x, sr, x, tio, 3, substitutes, for, room, temperature, devices, other, potential, materials, include, microwave, dielectrics, and, carbon, nanotube, cnt, composites, in, 2013, multi, sheet, layers, of, strontium, titanate, interleaved, with, single, layers, of, strontium, oxide, produced, a, dielectric, capable, of, operating, at, up, to, 125, ghz, the, material, was, created, via, molecular, beam, epitaxy, the, two, have, mismatched, crystal, spacing, that, produces, strain, within, the, strontium, titanate, layer, that, makes, it, less, stable, and, tunable, systems, such, as, ba, 1, x, sr, x, tio, 3, have, a, paraelectric, ferroelectric, transition, just, below, ambient, temperature, providing, high, tunability, films, suffer, significant, losses, arising, from, defects, commercially, manufactured, capacitors, typically, use, a, solid, dielectric, material, with, high, permittivity, as, the, intervening, medium, between, the, stored, positive, and, negative, charges, this, material, is, often, referred, to, in, technical, contexts, as, the, capacitor, dielectric, the, most, obvious, advantage, to, using, such, a, dielectric, material, is, that, it, prevents, the, conducting, plates, on, which, the, charges, are, stored, from, coming, into, direct, electrical, contact, more, significantly, however, a, high, permittivity, allows, a, greater, stored, charge, at, a, given, voltage, this, can, be, seen, by, treating, the, case, of, a, linear, dielectric, with, permittivity, and, thickness, d, between, two, conducting, plates, with, uniform, charge, density, in, this, case, the, charge, density, is, given, by, v, d, displaystyle, sigma, varepsilon, varepsilon, frac, v, d, and, the, capacitance, per, unit, area, by, c, v, d, displaystyle, c, frac, sigma, varepsilon, v, frac, varepsilon, d, from, this, it, can, easily, be, seen, that, a, larger, leads, to, greater, charge, stored, and, thus, greater, capacitance, dielectric, materials, used, for, capacitors, are, also, chosen, such, that, they, are, resistant, to, ionisation, this, allows, the, capacitor, to, operate, at, higher, voltages, before, the, insulating, dielectric, ionises, and, begins, to, allow, undesirable, current, a, dielectric, resonator, oscillator, dro, is, an, electronic, component, that, exhibits, resonance, of, the, polarisation, response, for, a, narrow, range, of, frequencies, generally, in, the, microwave, band, it, consists, of, a, puck, of, ceramic, that, has, a, large, dielectric, constant, and, a, low, dissipation, factor, such, resonators, are, often, used, to, provide, a, frequency, reference, in, an, oscillator, circuit, an, unshielded, dielectric, resonator, can, be, used, as, a, dielectric, resonator, antenna, dra, from, 2002, to, 2004, the, united, states, army, research, laboratory, arl, conducted, research, on, thin, film, technology, barium, strontium, titanate, bst, a, ferroelectric, thin, film, was, studied, for, the, fabrication, of, radio, frequency, and, microwave, components, such, as, voltage, controlled, oscillators, tunable, filters, and, phase, shifters, the, research, was, part, of, an, effort, to, provide, the, army, with, highly, tunable, microwave, compatible, materials, for, broadband, electric, field, tunable, devices, which, operate, consistently, in, extreme, temperatures, this, work, improved, tunability, of, bulk, barium, strontium, titanate, which, is, a, thin, film, enabler, for, electronics, components, in, a, 2004,

solids, liquids, or, gases, a, high, vacuum, can, also, be, a, useful, nearly, lossless, dielectric, even, though, its, relative, dielectric, constant, is, only, unity, solid, dielectrics, are, perhaps, the, most, commonly, used, dielectrics, in, electrical, engineering, and, many, solids, are, very, good, insulators, some, examples, include, porcelain, glass, and, most, plastics, air, nitrogen, and, sulfur, hexafluoride, are, the, three, most, commonly, used, gaseous, dielectrics
