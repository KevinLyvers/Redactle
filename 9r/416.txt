lutetium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, lu, and, atomic, number, 71, it, is, a, silvery, white, metal, which, resists, corrosion, in, dry, air, but, not, in, moist, air, lutetium, is, the, last, element, in, the, lanthanide, series, and, it, is, traditionally, counted, among, the, rare, earth, elements, it, can, also, be, classified, as, the, first, element, of, the, 6th, period, transition, metals, lutetium, was, independently, discovered, in, 1907, by, french, scientist, georges, urbain, austrian, mineralogist, baron, carl, auer, von, welsbach, and, american, chemist, charles, james, all, of, these, researchers, found, lutetium, as, an, impurity, in, the, mineral, ytterbia, which, was, previously, thought, to, consist, entirely, of, ytterbium, and, oxygen, the, dispute, on, the, priority, of, the, discovery, occurred, shortly, after, with, urbain, and, welsbach, accusing, each, other, of, publishing, results, influenced, by, the, published, research, of, the, other, the, naming, honor, went, to, urbain, as, he, had, published, his, results, earlier, he, chose, the, name, lutecium, for, the, new, element, but, in, 1949, the, spelling, was, changed, to, lutetium, in, 1909, the, priority, was, finally, granted, to, urbain, and, his, names, were, adopted, as, official, ones, however, the, name, cassiopeium, or, later, cassiopium, for, element, 71, proposed, by, welsbach, was, used, by, many, german, scientists, until, the, 1950s, lutetium, is, not, a, particularly, abundant, element, although, it, is, significantly, more, common, than, silver, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, has, few, specific, uses, lutetium, 176, is, a, relatively, abundant, 2, 5, radioactive, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, about, 38, billion, years, used, to, determine, the, age, of, minerals, and, meteorites, lutetium, usually, occurs, in, association, with, the, element, yttrium, and, is, sometimes, used, in, metal, alloys, and, as, a, catalyst, in, various, chemical, reactions, 177, lu, dota, tate, is, used, for, radionuclide, therapy, see, nuclear, medicine, on, neuroendocrine, tumours, lutetium, has, the, highest, brinell, hardness, of, any, lanthanide, at, 890, 1300, mpa, a, lutetium, atom, has, 71, electrons, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 14, 5d, 1, 6s, 2, lutetium, is, generally, encountered, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, having, lost, its, two, outermost, 6s, and, the, single, 5d, electron, the, lutetium, atom, is, the, smallest, among, the, lanthanide, atoms, due, to, the, lanthanide, contraction, and, as, a, result, lutetium, has, the, highest, density, melting, point, and, hardness, of, the, lanthanides, as, lutetium, s, 4f, orbitals, are, highly, stabilized, only, the, 5d, and, 6s, orbitals, are, involved, in, chemical, reactions, and, bonding, thus, it, is, characterized, as, a, d, block, rather, than, an, f, block, element, and, on, this, basis, some, consider, it, not, to, be, a, lanthanide, at, all, but, a, transition, metal, like, its, lighter, congeners, scandium, and, yttrium, lutetium, s, compounds, almost, always, contain, the, element, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, aqueous, solutions, of, most, lutetium, salts, are, colorless, and, form, white, crystalline, solids, upon, drying, with, the, common, exception, of, the, iodide, which, is, brown, the, soluble, salts, such, as, nitrate, sulfate, and, acetate, form, hydrates, upon, crystallization, the, oxide, hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate, and, oxalate, are, insoluble, in, water, lutetium, metal, is, slightly, unstable, in, air, at, standard, conditions, but, it, burns, readily, at, 150, c, to, form, lutetium, oxide, the, resulting, compound, is, known, to, absorb, water, and, carbon, dioxide, and, it, may, be, used, to, remove, vapors, of, these, compounds, from, closed, atmospheres, similar, observations, are, made, during, reaction, between, lutetium, and, water, slow, when, cold, and, fast, when, hot, lutetium, hydroxide, is, formed, in, the, reaction, lutetium, metal, is, known, to, react, with, the, four, lightest, halogens, to, form, tri, halides, except, the, fluoride, they, are, soluble, in, water, lutetium, dissolves, readily, in, weak, acids, and, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, colorless, lutetium, ions, which, are, coordinated, by, between, seven, and, nine, water, molecules, the, average, being, 3, lutetium, is, usually, found, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, like, most, other, lanthanides, however, it, can, also, be, in, the, 0, 1, and, 2, states, as, well, lutetium, occurs, on, the, earth, in, form, of, two, isotopes, lutetium, 175, and, lutetium, 176, out, of, these, two, only, the, former, is, stable, making, the, element, monoisotopic, the, latter, one, lutetium, 176, decays, via, beta, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 78, 10, 10, years, it, makes, up, about, 2, 5, of, natural, lutetium, to, date, 40, synthetic, radioisotopes, of, the, element, have, been, characterized, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 149, to, 190, the, most, stable, such, isotopes, are, lutetium, 174, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 31, years, and, lutetium, 173, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 37, years, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 9, days, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, half, an, hour, isotopes, lighter, than, the, stable, lutetium, 175, decay, via, electron, capture, to, produce, isotopes, of, ytterbium, with, some, alpha, and, positron, emission, the, heavier, isotopes, decay, primarily, via, beta, decay, producing, hafnium, isotopes, the, element, also, has, 43, known, nuclear, isomers, with, masses, of, 150, 151, 153, 162, and, 166, 180, not, every, mass, number, corresponds, to, only, one, isomer, the, most, stable, of, them, are, lutetium, 177m, with, a, half, life, of, 160, 4, days, and, lutetium, 174m, with, a, half, life, of, 142, days, these, are, longer, than, the, half, lives, of, the, ground, states, of, all, radioactive, lutetium, isotopes, except, lutetium, 173, 174, and, 176, lutetium, derived, from, the, latin, lutetia, paris, was, independently, discovered, in, 1907, by, french, scientist, georges, urbain, austrian, mineralogist, baron, carl, auer, von, welsbach, and, american, chemist, charles, james, they, found, it, as, an, impurity, in, ytterbia, which, was, thought, by, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, to, consist, entirely, of, ytterbium, the, scientists, proposed, different, names, for, the, elements, urbain, chose, neoytterbium, and, lutecium, whereas, welsbach, chose, aldebaranium, and, cassiopeium, after, aldebaran, and, cassiopeia, both, of, these, articles, accused, the, other, man, of, publishing, results, based, on, those, of, the, author, the, international, commission, on, atomic, weights, which, was, then, responsible, for, the, attribution, of, new, element, names, settled, the, dispute, in, 1909, by, granting, priority, to, urbain, and, adopting, his, names, as, official, ones, based, on, the, fact, that, the, separation, of, lutetium, from, marignac, s, ytterbium, was, first, described, by, urbain, after, urbain, s, names, were, recognized, neoytterbium, was, reverted, to, ytterbium, an, obvious, issue, with, this, decision, is, that, urbain, was, on, the, international, commission, of, atomic, weights, until, the, 1950s, some, german, speaking, chemists, called, lutetium, by, welsbach, s, name, cassiopeium, in, 1949, the, spelling, of, element, 71, was, changed, to, lutetium, the, reason, for, this, was, that, welsbach, s, 1907, samples, of, lutetium, had, been, pure, while, urbain, s, 1907, samples, only, contained, traces, of, lutetium, this, later, misled, urbain, into, thinking, that, he, had, discovered, element, 72, which, he, named, celtium, which, was, actually, very, pure, lutetium, the, later, discrediting, of, urbain, s, work, on, element, 72, led, to, a, reappraisal, of, welsbach, s, work, on, element, 71, so, that, the, element, was, renamed, to, cassiopeium, in, german, speaking, countries, for, some, time, charles, james, who, stayed, out, of, the, priority, argument, worked, on, a, much, larger, scale, and, possessed, the, largest, supply, of, lutetium, at, the, time, pure, lutetium, metal, was, first, produced, in, 1953, found, with, almost, all, other, rare, earth, metals, but, never, by, itself, lutetium, is, very, difficult, to, separate, from, other, elements, its, principal, commercial, source, is, as, a, by, product, from, the, processing, of, the, rare, earth, phosphate, mineral, monazite, ce, la, p, o, 4, which, has, concentrations, of, only, 0, 0001, of, the, element, not, much, higher, than, the, abundance, of, lutetium, in, the, earth, crust, of, about, 0, 5, mg, kg, no, lutetium, dominant, minerals, are, currently, known, the, main, mining, areas, are, china, united, states, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, the, world, production, of, lutetium, in, the, form, of, oxide, is, about, 10, tonnes, per, year, pure, lutetium, metal, is, very, difficult, to, prepare, it, is, one, of, the, rarest, and, most, expensive, of, the, rare, earth, metals, with, the, price, about, us, 10, 000, per, kilogram, or, about, one, fourth, that, of, gold, crushed, minerals, are, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, water, soluble, sulfates, of, rare, earths, thorium, precipitates, out, of, solution, as, hydroxide, and, is, removed, after, that, the, solution, is, treated, with, ammonium, oxalate, to, convert, rare, earths, into, their, insoluble, oxalates, the, oxalates, are, converted, to, oxides, by, annealing, the, oxides, are, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, that, excludes, one, of, the, main, components, cerium, whose, oxide, is, insoluble, in, hno, 3, several, rare, earth, metals, including, lutetium, are, separated, as, a, double, salt, with, ammonium, nitrate, by, crystallization, lutetium, is, separated, by, ion, exchange, in, this, process, rare, earth, ions, are, adsorbed, onto, suitable, ion, exchange, resin, by, exchange, with, hydrogen, ammonium, or, cupric, ions, present, in, the, resin, lutetium, salts, are, then, selectively, washed, out, by, suitable, complexing, agent, lutetium, metal, is, then, obtained, by, reduction, of, anhydrous, lu, cl, 3, or, lu, f, 3, by, either, an, alkali, metal, or, alkaline, earth, metal, 177, lu, is, produced, by, neutron, activation, of, 176, lu, or, by, indirectly, by, neutron, activation, of, 176, yb, followed, by, beta, decay, the, 6, 693, day, half, life, allows, transport, from, the, production, reactor, to, the, point, of, use, without, significant, loss, in, activity, small, quantities, of, lutetium, have, many, speciality, uses, stable, lutetium, can, be, used, as, catalysts, in, petroleum, cracking, in, refineries, and, can, also, be, used, in, alkylation, hydrogenation, and, polymerization, applications, lutetium, aluminium, garnet, al, 5, lu, 3, o, 12, has, been, proposed, for, use, as, a, lens, material, in, high, refractive, index, immersion, lithography, additionally, a, tiny, amount, of, lutetium, is, added, as, a, dopant, to, gadolinium, gallium, garnet, which, is, used, in, magnetic, bubble, memory, devices, cerium, doped, lutetium, oxyorthosilicate, is, currently, the, preferred, compound, for, detectors, in, positron, emission, tomography, pet, lutetium, aluminium, garnet, luag, is, used, as, a, phosphor, in, light, emitting, diode, light, bulbs, lutetium, tantalate, lutao, 4, is, the, densest, known, stable, white, material, density, 9, 81, g, cm, 3, and, therefore, is, an, ideal, host, for, x, ray, phosphors, the, only, denser, white, material, is, thorium, dioxide, with, density, of, 10, g, cm, 3, but, the, thorium, it, contains, is, radioactive, lutetium, is, also, a, compound, of, several, scintillating, materials, which, convert, x, rays, to, visible, light, it, is, part, of, lyso, luag, and, lutetium, iodide, scintillators, research, indicates, that, lutetium, ion, atomic, clocks, could, provide, greater, accuracy, than, any, existing, atomic, clock, the, suitable, half, life, and, decay, mode, made, lutetium, 176, used, as, a, pure, beta, emitter, using, lutetium, which, has, been, exposed, to, neutron, activation, and, in, lutetium, hafnium, dating, to, date, meteorites, the, isotope, 177, lu, emits, low, energy, beta, particles, and, gamma, rays, and, has, a, half, life, around, 7, days, positive, characteristics, for, commercial, applications, especially, in, therapeutic, nuclear, medicine, the, synthetic, isotope, lutetium, 177, bound, to, octreotate, a, somatostatin, analogue, is, used, experimentally, in, targeted, radionuclide, therapy, for, neuroendocrine, tumors, lutetium, 177, is, used, as, a, radionuclide, in, neuroendocrine, tumor, therapy, and, bone, pain, palliation, lutetium, 177, lu, vipivotide, tetraxetan, is, a, therapy, for, prostate, cancer, fda, approved, in, 2022, like, other, rare, earth, metals, lutetium, is, regarded, as, having, a, low, degree, of, toxicity, but, its, compounds, should, be, handled, with, care, nonetheless, for, example, lutetium, fluoride, inhalation, is, dangerous, and, the, compound, irritates, skin, lutetium, nitrate, may, be, dangerous, as, it, may, explode, and, burn, once, heated, lutetium, oxide, powder, is, toxic, as, well, if, inhaled, or, ingested, similarly, to, the, other, rare, earth, metals, lutetium, has, no, known, biological, role, but, it, is, found, even, in, humans, concentrating, in, bones, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, liver, and, kidneys, lutetium, salts, are, known, to, occur, together, with, other, lanthanide, salts, in, nature, the, element, is, the, least, abundant, in, the, human, body, of, all, lanthanides, human, diets, have, not, been, monitored, for, lutetium, content, so, it, is, not, known, how, much, the, average, human, takes, in, but, estimations, show, the, amount, is, only, about, several, micrograms, per, year, all, coming, from, tiny, amounts, absorbed, by, plants, soluble, lutetium, salts, are, mildly, toxic, but, insoluble, ones, are, not
