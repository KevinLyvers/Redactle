quantum, mechanics, is, a, fundamental, theory, that, describes, the, behavior, of, nature, at, and, below, the, scale, of, atoms, 1, 1, it, is, the, foundation, of, all, quantum, physics, which, includes, quantum, chemistry, quantum, field, theory, quantum, technology, and, quantum, information, science, quantum, mechanics, can, describe, many, systems, that, classical, physics, cannot, classical, physics, can, describe, many, aspects, of, nature, at, an, ordinary, macroscopic, and, optical, microscopic, scale, but, is, not, sufficient, for, describing, them, at, very, small, submicroscopic, atomic, and, subatomic, scales, most, theories, in, classical, physics, can, be, derived, from, quantum, mechanics, as, an, approximation, valid, at, large, macroscopic, microscopic, scale, quantum, systems, have, bound, states, that, are, quantized, to, discrete, values, of, energy, momentum, angular, momentum, and, other, quantities, in, contrast, to, classical, systems, where, these, quantities, can, be, measured, continuously, measurements, of, quantum, systems, show, characteristics, of, both, particles, and, waves, wave, particle, duality, and, there, are, limits, to, how, accurately, the, value, of, a, physical, quantity, can, be, predicted, prior, to, its, measurement, given, a, complete, set, of, initial, conditions, the, uncertainty, principle, quantum, mechanics, arose, gradually, from, theories, to, explain, observations, that, could, not, be, reconciled, with, classical, physics, such, as, max, planck, s, solution, in, 1900, to, the, black, body, radiation, problem, and, the, correspondence, between, energy, and, frequency, in, albert, einstein, s, 1905, paper, which, explained, the, photoelectric, effect, these, early, attempts, to, understand, microscopic, phenomena, now, known, as, the, old, quantum, theory, led, to, the, full, development, of, quantum, mechanics, in, the, mid, 1920s, by, niels, bohr, erwin, schr, dinger, werner, heisenberg, max, born, paul, dirac, and, others, the, modern, theory, is, formulated, in, various, specially, developed, mathematical, formalisms, in, one, of, them, a, mathematical, entity, called, the, wave, function, provides, information, in, the, form, of, probability, amplitudes, about, what, measurements, of, a, particle, s, energy, momentum, and, other, physical, properties, may, yield, quantum, mechanics, allows, the, calculation, of, properties, and, behaviour, of, physical, systems, it, is, typically, applied, to, microscopic, systems, molecules, atoms, and, sub, atomic, particles, it, has, been, demonstrated, to, hold, for, complex, molecules, with, thousands, of, atoms, but, its, application, to, human, beings, raises, philosophical, problems, such, as, wigner, s, friend, and, its, application, to, the, universe, as, a, whole, remains, speculative, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, have, been, verified, experimentally, to, an, extremely, high, degree, of, accuracy, for, example, the, refinement, of, quantum, mechanics, for, the, interaction, of, light, and, matter, known, as, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, has, been, shown, to, agree, with, experiment, to, within, 1, part, in, 10, 12, when, predicting, the, magnetic, properties, of, an, electron, a, fundamental, feature, of, the, theory, is, that, it, usually, cannot, predict, with, certainty, what, will, happen, but, only, give, probabilities, mathematically, a, probability, is, found, by, taking, the, square, of, the, absolute, value, of, a, complex, number, known, as, a, probability, amplitude, this, is, known, as, the, born, rule, named, after, physicist, max, born, for, example, a, quantum, particle, like, an, electron, can, be, described, by, a, wave, function, which, associates, to, each, point, in, space, a, probability, amplitude, applying, the, born, rule, to, these, amplitudes, gives, a, probability, density, function, for, the, position, that, the, electron, will, be, found, to, have, when, an, experiment, is, performed, to, measure, it, this, is, the, best, the, theory, can, do, it, cannot, say, for, certain, where, the, electron, will, be, found, the, schr, dinger, equation, relates, the, collection, of, probability, amplitudes, that, pertain, to, one, moment, of, time, to, the, collection, of, probability, amplitudes, that, pertain, to, another, 67, 87, one, consequence, of, the, mathematical, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, is, a, tradeoff, in, predictability, between, different, measurable, quantities, the, most, famous, form, of, this, uncertainty, principle, says, that, no, matter, how, a, quantum, particle, is, prepared, or, how, carefully, experiments, upon, it, are, arranged, it, is, impossible, to, have, a, precise, prediction, for, a, measurement, of, its, position, and, also, at, the, same, time, for, a, measurement, of, its, momentum, 427, 435, another, consequence, of, the, mathematical, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, is, the, phenomenon, of, quantum, interference, which, is, often, illustrated, with, the, double, slit, experiment, in, the, basic, version, of, this, experiment, a, coherent, light, source, such, as, a, laser, beam, illuminates, a, plate, pierced, by, two, parallel, slits, and, the, light, passing, through, the, slits, is, observed, on, a, screen, behind, the, plate, 102, 111, 1, 1, 1, 8, the, wave, nature, of, light, causes, the, light, waves, passing, through, the, two, slits, to, interfere, producing, bright, and, dark, bands, on, the, screen, a, result, that, would, not, be, expected, if, light, consisted, of, classical, particles, however, the, light, is, always, found, to, be, absorbed, at, the, screen, at, discrete, points, as, individual, particles, rather, than, waves, the, interference, pattern, appears, via, the, varying, density, of, these, particle, hits, on, the, screen, furthermore, versions, of, the, experiment, that, include, detectors, at, the, slits, find, that, each, detected, photon, passes, through, one, slit, as, would, a, classical, particle, and, not, through, both, slits, as, would, a, wave, 109, however, such, experiments, demonstrate, that, particles, do, not, form, the, interference, pattern, if, one, detects, which, slit, they, pass, through, this, behavior, is, known, as, wave, particle, duality, in, addition, to, light, electrons, atoms, and, molecules, are, all, found, to, exhibit, the, same, dual, behavior, when, fired, towards, a, double, slit, another, non, classical, phenomenon, predicted, by, quantum, mechanics, is, quantum, tunnelling, a, particle, that, goes, up, against, a, potential, barrier, can, cross, it, even, if, its, kinetic, energy, is, smaller, than, the, maximum, of, the, potential, in, classical, mechanics, this, particle, would, be, trapped, quantum, tunnelling, has, several, important, consequences, enabling, radioactive, decay, nuclear, fusion, in, stars, and, applications, such, as, scanning, tunnelling, microscopy, tunnel, diode, and, tunnel, field, effect, transistor, when, quantum, systems, interact, the, result, can, be, the, creation, of, quantum, entanglement, their, properties, become, so, intertwined, that, a, description, of, the, whole, solely, in, terms, of, the, individual, parts, is, no, longer, possible, erwin, schr, dinger, called, entanglement, the, characteristic, trait, of, quantum, mechanics, the, one, that, enforces, its, entire, departure, from, classical, lines, of, thought, quantum, entanglement, enables, quantum, computing, and, is, part, of, quantum, communication, protocols, such, as, quantum, key, distribution, and, superdense, coding, contrary, to, popular, misconception, entanglement, does, not, allow, sending, signals, faster, than, light, as, demonstrated, by, the, no, communication, theorem, another, possibility, opened, by, entanglement, is, testing, for, hidden, variables, hypothetical, properties, more, fundamental, than, the, quantities, addressed, in, quantum, theory, itself, knowledge, of, which, would, allow, more, exact, predictions, than, quantum, theory, can, provide, a, collection, of, results, most, significantly, bell, s, theorem, have, demonstrated, that, broad, classes, of, such, hidden, variable, theories, are, in, fact, incompatible, with, quantum, physics, according, to, bell, s, theorem, if, nature, actually, operates, in, accord, with, any, theory, of, local, hidden, variables, then, the, results, of, a, bell, test, will, be, constrained, in, a, particular, quantifiable, way, many, bell, tests, have, been, performed, and, they, have, shown, results, incompatible, with, the, constraints, imposed, by, local, hidden, variables, it, is, not, possible, to, present, these, concepts, in, more, than, a, superficial, way, without, introducing, the, actual, mathematics, involved, understanding, quantum, mechanics, requires, not, only, manipulating, complex, numbers, but, also, linear, algebra, differential, equations, group, theory, and, other, more, advanced, subjects, accordingly, this, article, will, present, a, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, survey, its, application, to, some, useful, and, oft, studied, examples, in, the, mathematically, rigorous, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, state, of, a, quantum, mechanical, system, is, a, vector, displaystyle, psi, belonging, to, a, separable, complex, hilbert, space, h, displaystyle, mathcal, h, this, vector, is, postulated, to, be, normalized, under, the, hilbert, space, inner, product, that, is, it, obeys, 1, displaystyle, langle, psi, psi, rangle, 1, and, it, is, well, defined, up, to, a, complex, number, of, modulus, 1, the, global, phase, that, is, displaystyle, psi, and, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, alpha, psi, represent, the, same, physical, system, in, other, words, the, possible, states, are, points, in, the, projective, space, of, a, hilbert, space, usually, called, the, complex, projective, space, the, exact, nature, of, this, hilbert, space, is, dependent, on, the, system, for, example, for, describing, position, and, momentum, the, hilbert, space, is, the, space, of, complex, square, integrable, functions, l, 2, c, displaystyle, l, 2, mathbb, c, while, the, hilbert, space, for, the, spin, of, a, single, proton, is, simply, the, space, of, two, dimensional, complex, vectors, c, 2, displaystyle, mathbb, c, 2, with, the, usual, inner, product, physical, quantities, of, interest, position, momentum, energy, spin, are, represented, by, observables, which, are, hermitian, more, precisely, self, adjoint, linear, operators, acting, on, the, hilbert, space, a, quantum, state, can, be, an, eigenvector, of, an, observable, in, which, case, it, is, called, an, eigenstate, and, the, associated, eigenvalue, corresponds, to, the, value, of, the, observable, in, that, eigenstate, more, generally, a, quantum, state, will, be, a, linear, combination, of, the, eigenstates, known, as, a, quantum, superposition, when, an, observable, is, measured, the, result, will, be, one, of, its, eigenvalues, with, probability, given, by, the, born, rule, in, the, simplest, case, the, eigenvalue, displaystyle, lambda, is, non, degenerate, and, the, probability, is, given, by, 2, displaystyle, langle, vec, lambda, psi, rangle, 2, where, displaystyle, vec, lambda, is, its, associated, eigenvector, more, generally, the, eigenvalue, is, degenerate, and, the, probability, is, given, by, p, displaystyle, langle, psi, p, lambda, psi, rangle, where, p, displaystyle, p, lambda, is, the, projector, onto, its, associated, eigenspace, in, the, continuous, case, these, formulas, give, instead, the, probability, density, after, the, measurement, if, result, displaystyle, lambda, was, obtained, the, quantum, state, is, postulated, to, collapse, to, displaystyle, vec, lambda, in, the, non, degenerate, case, or, to, p, p, textstyle, p, lambda, psi, big, sqrt, langle, psi, p, lambda, psi, rangle, in, the, general, case, the, probabilistic, nature, of, quantum, mechanics, thus, stems, from, the, act, of, measurement, this, is, one, of, the, most, difficult, aspects, of, quantum, systems, to, understand, it, was, the, central, topic, in, the, famous, bohr, einstein, debates, in, which, the, two, scientists, attempted, to, clarify, these, fundamental, principles, by, way, of, thought, experiments, in, the, decades, after, the, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, question, of, what, constitutes, a, measurement, has, been, extensively, studied, newer, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, have, been, formulated, that, do, away, with, the, concept, of, wave, function, collapse, see, for, example, the, many, worlds, interpretation, the, basic, idea, is, that, when, a, quantum, system, interacts, with, a, measuring, apparatus, their, respective, wave, functions, become, entangled, so, that, the, original, quantum, system, ceases, to, exist, as, an, independent, entity, see, measurement, in, quantum, mechanics, the, time, evolution, of, a, quantum, state, is, described, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, here, h, displaystyle, h, denotes, the, hamiltonian, the, observable, corresponding, to, the, total, energy, of, the, system, and, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, the, constant, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, is, introduced, so, that, the, hamiltonian, is, reduced, to, the, classical, hamiltonian, in, cases, where, the, quantum, system, can, be, approximated, by, a, classical, system, the, ability, to, make, such, an, approximation, in, certain, limits, is, called, the, correspondence, principle, the, solution, of, this, differential, equation, is, given, by, the, operator, u, t, e, i, h, t, displaystyle, u, t, e, iht, hbar, is, known, as, the, time, evolution, operator, and, has, the, crucial, property, that, it, is, unitary, this, time, evolution, is, deterministic, in, the, sense, that, given, an, initial, quantum, state, 0, displaystyle, psi, 0, it, makes, a, definite, prediction, of, what, the, quantum, state, t, displaystyle, psi, t, will, be, at, any, later, time, some, wave, functions, produce, probability, distributions, that, are, independent, of, time, such, as, eigenstates, of, the, hamiltonian, 133, 137, many, systems, that, are, treated, dynamically, in, classical, mechanics, are, described, by, such, static, wave, functions, for, example, a, single, electron, in, an, unexcited, atom, is, pictured, classically, as, a, particle, moving, in, a, circular, trajectory, around, the, atomic, nucleus, whereas, in, quantum, mechanics, it, is, described, by, a, static, wave, function, surrounding, the, nucleus, for, example, the, electron, wave, function, for, an, unexcited, hydrogen, atom, is, a, spherically, symmetric, function, known, as, an, s, orbital, fig, 1, analytic, solutions, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, are, known, for, very, few, relatively, simple, model, hamiltonians, including, the, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, the, particle, in, a, box, the, dihydrogen, cation, and, the, hydrogen, atom, even, the, helium, atom, which, contains, just, two, electrons, has, defied, all, attempts, at, a, fully, analytic, treatment, admitting, no, solution, in, closed, form, however, there, are, techniques, for, finding, approximate, solutions, one, method, called, perturbation, theory, uses, the, analytic, result, for, a, simple, quantum, mechanical, model, to, create, a, result, for, a, related, but, more, complicated, model, by, for, example, the, addition, of, a, weak, potential, energy, 793, another, approximation, method, applies, to, systems, for, which, quantum, mechanics, produces, only, small, deviations, from, classical, behavior, these, deviations, can, then, be, computed, based, on, the, classical, motion, 849, one, consequence, of, the, basic, quantum, formalism, is, the, uncertainty, principle, in, its, most, familiar, form, this, states, that, no, preparation, of, a, quantum, particle, can, imply, simultaneously, precise, predictions, both, for, a, measurement, of, its, position, and, for, a, measurement, of, its, momentum, both, position, and, momentum, are, observables, meaning, that, they, are, represented, by, hermitian, operators, the, position, operator, x, displaystyle, hat, x, and, momentum, operator, p, displaystyle, hat, p, do, not, commute, but, rather, satisfy, the, canonical, commutation, relation, given, a, quantum, state, the, born, rule, lets, us, compute, expectation, values, for, both, x, displaystyle, x, and, p, displaystyle, p, and, moreover, for, powers, of, them, defining, the, uncertainty, for, an, observable, by, a, standard, deviation, we, have, and, likewise, for, the, momentum, the, uncertainty, principle, states, that, either, standard, deviation, can, in, principle, be, made, arbitrarily, small, but, not, both, simultaneously, this, inequality, generalizes, to, arbitrary, pairs, of, self, adjoint, operators, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, the, commutator, of, these, two, operators, is, and, this, provides, the, lower, bound, on, the, product, of, standard, deviations, another, consequence, of, the, canonical, commutation, relation, is, that, the, position, and, momentum, operators, are, fourier, transforms, of, each, other, so, that, a, description, of, an, object, according, to, its, momentum, is, the, fourier, transform, of, its, description, according, to, its, position, the, fact, that, dependence, in, momentum, is, the, fourier, transform, of, the, dependence, in, position, means, that, the, momentum, operator, is, equivalent, up, to, an, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, factor, to, taking, the, derivative, according, to, the, position, since, in, fourier, analysis, differentiation, corresponds, to, multiplication, in, the, dual, space, this, is, why, in, quantum, equations, in, position, space, the, momentum, p, i, displaystyle, p, i, is, replaced, by, i, x, displaystyle, i, hbar, frac, partial, partial, x, and, in, particular, in, the, non, relativistic, schr, dinger, equation, in, position, space, the, momentum, squared, term, is, replaced, with, a, laplacian, times, 2, displaystyle, hbar, 2, when, two, different, quantum, systems, are, considered, together, the, hilbert, space, of, the, combined, system, is, the, tensor, product, of, the, hilbert, spaces, of, the, two, components, for, example, let, a, and, b, be, two, quantum, systems, with, hilbert, spaces, h, a, displaystyle, mathcal, h, a, and, h, b, displaystyle, mathcal, h, b, respectively, the, hilbert, space, of, the, composite, system, is, then, if, the, state, for, the, first, system, is, the, vector, a, displaystyle, psi, a, and, the, state, for, the, second, system, is, b, displaystyle, psi, b, then, the, state, of, the, composite, system, is, not, all, states, in, the, joint, hilbert, space, h, a, b, displaystyle, mathcal, h, ab, can, be, written, in, this, form, however, because, the, superposition, principle, implies, that, linear, combinations, of, these, separable, or, product, states, are, also, valid, for, example, if, a, displaystyle, psi, a, and, a, displaystyle, phi, a, are, both, possible, states, for, system, a, displaystyle, a, and, likewise, b, displaystyle, psi, b, and, b, displaystyle, phi, b, are, both, possible, states, for, system, b, displaystyle, b, then, is, a, valid, joint, state, that, is, not, separable, states, that, are, not, separable, are, called, entangled, if, the, state, for, a, composite, system, is, entangled, it, is, impossible, to, describe, either, component, system, a, or, system, b, by, a, state, vector, one, can, instead, define, reduced, density, matrices, that, describe, the, statistics, that, can, be, obtained, by, making, measurements, on, either, component, system, alone, this, necessarily, causes, a, loss, of, information, though, knowing, the, reduced, density, matrices, of, the, individual, systems, is, not, enough, to, reconstruct, the, state, of, the, composite, system, just, as, density, matrices, specify, the, state, of, a, subsystem, of, a, larger, system, analogously, positive, operator, valued, measures, povms, describe, the, effect, on, a, subsystem, of, a, measurement, performed, on, a, larger, system, povms, are, extensively, used, in, quantum, information, theory, as, described, above, entanglement, is, a, key, feature, of, models, of, measurement, processes, in, which, an, apparatus, becomes, entangled, with, the, system, being, measured, systems, interacting, with, the, environment, in, which, they, reside, generally, become, entangled, with, that, environment, a, phenomenon, known, as, quantum, decoherence, this, can, explain, why, in, practice, quantum, effects, are, difficult, to, observe, in, systems, larger, than, microscopic, there, are, many, mathematically, equivalent, formulations, of, quantum, mechanics, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, common, is, the, transformation, theory, proposed, by, paul, dirac, which, unifies, and, generalizes, the, two, earliest, formulations, of, quantum, mechanics, matrix, mechanics, invented, by, werner, heisenberg, and, wave, mechanics, invented, by, erwin, schr, dinger, an, alternative, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, is, feynman, s, path, integral, formulation, in, which, a, quantum, mechanical, amplitude, is, considered, as, a, sum, over, all, possible, classical, and, non, classical, paths, between, the, initial, and, final, states, this, is, the, quantum, mechanical, counterpart, of, the, action, principle, in, classical, mechanics, the, hamiltonian, h, displaystyle, h, is, known, as, the, generator, of, time, evolution, since, it, defines, a, unitary, time, evolution, operator, u, t, e, i, h, t, displaystyle, u, t, e, iht, hbar, for, each, value, of, t, displaystyle, t, from, this, relation, between, u, t, displaystyle, u, t, and, h, displaystyle, h, it, follows, that, any, observable, a, displaystyle, a, that, commutes, with, h, displaystyle, h, will, be, conserved, its, expectation, value, will, not, change, over, time, 471, this, statement, generalizes, as, mathematically, any, hermitian, operator, a, displaystyle, a, can, generate, a, family, of, unitary, operators, parameterized, by, a, variable, t, displaystyle, t, under, the, evolution, generated, by, a, displaystyle, a, any, observable, b, displaystyle, b, that, commutes, with, a, displaystyle, a, will, be, conserved, moreover, if, b, displaystyle, b, is, conserved, by, evolution, under, a, displaystyle, a, then, a, displaystyle, a, is, conserved, under, the, evolution, generated, by, b, displaystyle, b, this, implies, a, quantum, version, of, the, result, proven, by, emmy, noether, in, classical, lagrangian, mechanics, for, every, differentiable, symmetry, of, a, hamiltonian, there, exists, a, corresponding, conservation, law, the, simplest, example, of, a, quantum, system, with, a, position, degree, of, freedom, is, a, free, particle, in, a, single, spatial, dimension, a, free, particle, is, one, which, is, not, subject, to, external, influences, so, that, its, hamiltonian, consists, only, of, its, kinetic, energy, the, general, solution, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, given, by, which, is, a, superposition, of, all, possible, plane, waves, e, i, k, x, k, 2, 2, m, t, displaystyle, e, i, kx, frac, hbar, k, 2, 2m, t, which, are, eigenstates, of, the, momentum, operator, with, momentum, p, k, displaystyle, p, hbar, k, the, coefficients, of, the, superposition, are, k, 0, displaystyle, hat, psi, k, 0, which, is, the, fourier, transform, of, the, initial, quantum, state, x, 0, displaystyle, psi, x, 0, it, is, not, possible, for, the, solution, to, be, a, single, momentum, eigenstate, or, a, single, position, eigenstate, as, these, are, not, normalizable, quantum, states, instead, we, can, consider, a, gaussian, wave, packet, which, has, fourier, transform, and, therefore, momentum, distribution, we, see, that, as, we, make, a, displaystyle, a, smaller, the, spread, in, position, gets, smaller, but, the, spread, in, momentum, gets, larger, conversely, by, making, a, displaystyle, a, larger, we, make, the, spread, in, momentum, smaller, but, the, spread, in, position, gets, larger, this, illustrates, the, uncertainty, principle, as, we, let, the, gaussian, wave, packet, evolve, in, time, we, see, that, its, center, moves, through, space, at, a, constant, velocity, like, a, classical, particle, with, no, forces, acting, on, it, however, the, wave, packet, will, also, spread, out, as, time, progresses, which, means, that, the, position, becomes, more, and, more, uncertain, the, uncertainty, in, momentum, however, stays, constant, the, particle, in, a, one, dimensional, potential, energy, box, is, the, most, mathematically, simple, example, where, restraints, lead, to, the, quantization, of, energy, levels, the, box, is, defined, as, having, zero, potential, energy, everywhere, inside, a, certain, region, and, therefore, infinite, potential, energy, everywhere, outside, that, region, 77, 78, for, the, one, dimensional, case, in, the, x, displaystyle, x, direction, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, may, be, written, with, the, differential, operator, defined, by, the, previous, equation, is, evocative, of, the, classic, kinetic, energy, analogue, with, state, displaystyle, psi, in, this, case, having, energy, e, displaystyle, e, coincident, with, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, the, general, solutions, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, the, particle, in, a, box, are, or, from, euler, s, formula, the, infinite, potential, walls, of, the, box, determine, the, values, of, c, d, displaystyle, c, d, and, k, displaystyle, k, at, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, and, x, l, displaystyle, x, l, where, displaystyle, psi, must, be, zero, thus, at, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, and, d, 0, displaystyle, d, 0, at, x, l, displaystyle, x, l, in, which, c, displaystyle, c, cannot, be, zero, as, this, would, conflict, with, the, postulate, that, displaystyle, psi, has, norm, 1, therefore, since, sin, k, l, 0, displaystyle, sin, kl, 0, k, l, displaystyle, kl, must, be, an, integer, multiple, of, displaystyle, pi, this, constraint, on, k, displaystyle, k, implies, a, constraint, on, the, energy, levels, yielding, e, n, 2, 2, n, 2, 2, m, l, 2, n, 2, h, 2, 8, m, l, 2, displaystyle, e, n, frac, hbar, 2, pi, 2, n, 2, 2ml, 2, frac, n, 2, h, 2, 8ml, 2, a, finite, potential, well, is, the, generalization, of, the, infinite, potential, well, problem, to, potential, wells, having, finite, depth, the, finite, potential, well, problem, is, mathematically, more, complicated, than, the, infinite, particle, in, a, box, problem, as, the, wave, function, is, not, pinned, to, zero, at, the, walls, of, the, well, instead, the, wave, function, must, satisfy, more, complicated, mathematical, boundary, conditions, as, it, is, nonzero, in, regions, outside, the, well, another, related, problem, is, that, of, the, rectangular, potential, barrier, which, furnishes, a, model, for, the, quantum, tunneling, effect, that, plays, an, important, role, in, the, performance, of, modern, technologies, such, as, flash, memory, and, scanning, tunneling, microscopy, as, in, the, classical, case, the, potential, for, the, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, is, given, by, 234, this, problem, can, either, be, treated, by, directly, solving, the, schr, dinger, equation, which, is, not, trivial, or, by, using, the, more, elegant, ladder, method, first, proposed, by, paul, dirac, the, eigenstates, are, given, by, where, h, n, are, the, hermite, polynomials, and, the, corresponding, energy, levels, are, this, is, another, example, illustrating, the, discretization, of, energy, for, bound, states, the, mach, zehnder, interferometer, mzi, illustrates, the, concepts, of, superposition, and, interference, with, linear, algebra, in, dimension, 2, rather, than, differential, equations, it, can, be, seen, as, a, simplified, version, of, the, double, slit, experiment, but, it, is, of, interest, in, its, own, right, for, example, in, the, delayed, choice, quantum, eraser, the, elitzur, vaidman, bomb, tester, and, in, studies, of, quantum, entanglement, we, can, model, a, photon, going, through, the, interferometer, by, considering, that, at, each, point, it, can, be, in, a, superposition, of, only, two, paths, the, lower, path, which, starts, from, the, left, goes, straight, through, both, beam, splitters, and, ends, at, the, top, and, the, upper, path, which, starts, from, the, bottom, goes, straight, through, both, beam, splitters, and, ends, at, the, right, the, quantum, state, of, the, photon, is, therefore, a, vector, c, 2, displaystyle, psi, in, mathbb, c, 2, that, is, a, superposition, of, the, lower, path, l, 1, 0, displaystyle, psi, l, begin, pmatrix, 1, 0, end, pmatrix, and, the, upper, path, u, 0, 1, displaystyle, psi, u, begin, pmatrix, 0, 1, end, pmatrix, that, is, l, u, displaystyle, psi, alpha, psi, l, beta, psi, u, for, complex, displaystyle, alpha, beta, in, order, to, respect, the, postulate, that, 1, displaystyle, langle, psi, psi, rangle, 1, we, require, that, 2, 2, 1, displaystyle, alpha, 2, beta, 2, 1, both, beam, splitters, are, modelled, as, the, unitary, matrix, b, 1, 2, 1, i, i, 1, displaystyle, b, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, begin, pmatrix, 1, i, i, 1, end, pmatrix, which, means, that, when, a, photon, meets, the, beam, splitter, it, will, either, stay, on, the, same, path, with, a, probability, amplitude, of, 1, 2, displaystyle, 1, sqrt, 2, or, be, reflected, to, the, other, path, with, a, probability, amplitude, of, i, 2, displaystyle, i, sqrt, 2, the, phase, shifter, on, the, upper, arm, is, modelled, as, the, unitary, matrix, p, 1, 0, 0, e, i, displaystyle, p, begin, pmatrix, 1, 0, 0, e, i, delta, phi, end, pmatrix, which, means, that, if, the, photon, is, on, the, upper, path, it, will, gain, a, relative, phase, of, displaystyle, delta, phi, and, it, will, stay, unchanged, if, it, is, in, the, lower, path, a, photon, that, enters, the, interferometer, from, the, left, will, then, be, acted, upon, with, a, beam, splitter, b, displaystyle, b, a, phase, shifter, p, displaystyle, p, and, another, beam, splitter, b, displaystyle, b, and, so, end, up, in, the, state, and, the, probabilities, that, it, will, be, detected, at, the, right, or, at, the, top, are, given, respectively, by, one, can, therefore, use, the, mach, zehnder, interferometer, to, estimate, the, phase, shift, by, estimating, these, probabilities, it, is, interesting, to, consider, what, would, happen, if, the, photon, were, definitely, in, either, the, lower, or, upper, paths, between, the, beam, splitters, this, can, be, accomplished, by, blocking, one, of, the, paths, or, equivalently, by, removing, the, first, beam, splitter, and, feeding, the, photon, from, the, left, or, the, bottom, as, desired, in, both, cases, there, will, be, no, interference, between, the, paths, anymore, and, the, probabilities, are, given, by, p, u, p, l, 1, 2, displaystyle, p, u, p, l, 1, 2, independently, of, the, phase, displaystyle, delta, phi, from, this, we, can, conclude, that, the, photon, does, not, take, one, path, or, another, after, the, first, beam, splitter, but, rather, that, it, is, in, a, genuine, quantum, superposition, of, the, two, paths, quantum, mechanics, has, had, enormous, success, in, explaining, many, of, the, features, of, our, universe, with, regard, to, small, scale, and, discrete, quantities, and, interactions, which, cannot, be, explained, by, classical, methods, quantum, mechanics, is, often, the, only, theory, that, can, reveal, the, individual, behaviors, of, the, subatomic, particles, that, make, up, all, forms, of, matter, electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and, others, solid, state, physics, and, materials, science, are, dependent, upon, quantum, mechanics, in, many, aspects, modern, technology, operates, at, a, scale, where, quantum, effects, are, significant, important, applications, of, quantum, theory, include, quantum, chemistry, quantum, optics, quantum, computing, superconducting, magnets, light, emitting, diodes, the, optical, amplifier, and, the, laser, the, transistor, and, semiconductors, such, as, the, microprocessor, medical, and, research, imaging, such, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, electron, microscopy, explanations, for, many, biological, and, physical, phenomena, are, rooted, in, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, most, notably, the, macro, molecule, dna, the, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, assert, that, the, state, space, of, a, system, is, a, hilbert, space, and, that, observables, of, the, system, are, hermitian, operators, acting, on, vectors, in, that, space, although, they, do, not, tell, us, which, hilbert, space, or, which, operators, these, can, be, chosen, appropriately, in, order, to, obtain, a, quantitative, description, of, a, quantum, system, a, necessary, step, in, making, physical, predictions, an, important, guide, for, making, these, choices, is, the, correspondence, principle, a, heuristic, which, states, that, the, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, reduce, to, those, of, classical, mechanics, in, the, regime, of, large, quantum, numbers, one, can, also, start, from, an, established, classical, model, of, a, particular, system, and, then, try, to, guess, the, underlying, quantum, model, that, would, give, rise, to, the, classical, model, in, the, correspondence, limit, this, approach, is, known, as, quantization, 299, when, quantum, mechanics, was, originally, formulated, it, was, applied, to, models, whose, correspondence, limit, was, non, relativistic, classical, mechanics, for, instance, the, well, known, model, of, the, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, uses, an, explicitly, non, relativistic, expression, for, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, oscillator, and, is, thus, a, quantum, version, of, the, classical, harmonic, oscillator, 234, complications, arise, with, chaotic, systems, which, do, not, have, good, quantum, numbers, and, quantum, chaos, studies, the, relationship, between, classical, and, quantum, descriptions, in, these, systems, 353, quantum, decoherence, is, a, mechanism, through, which, quantum, systems, lose, coherence, and, thus, become, incapable, of, displaying, many, typically, quantum, effects, quantum, superpositions, become, simply, probabilistic, mixtures, and, quantum, entanglement, becomes, simply, classical, correlations, 687, 730, quantum, coherence, is, not, typically, evident, at, macroscopic, scales, though, at, temperatures, approaching, absolute, zero, quantum, behavior, may, manifest, macroscopically, many, macroscopic, properties, of, a, classical, system, are, a, direct, consequence, of, the, quantum, behavior, of, its, parts, for, example, the, stability, of, bulk, matter, consisting, of, atoms, and, molecules, which, would, quickly, collapse, under, electric, forces, alone, the, rigidity, of, solids, and, the, mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical, and, magnetic, properties, of, matter, are, all, results, of, the, interaction, of, electric, charges, under, the, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, early, attempts, to, merge, quantum, mechanics, with, special, relativity, involved, the, replacement, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, with, a, covariant, equation, such, as, the, klein, gordon, equation, or, the, dirac, equation, while, these, theories, were, successful, in, explaining, many, experimental, results, they, had, certain, unsatisfactory, qualities, stemming, from, their, neglect, of, the, relativistic, creation, and, annihilation, of, particles, a, fully, relativistic, quantum, theory, required, the, development, of, quantum, field, theory, which, applies, quantization, to, a, field, rather, than, a, fixed, set, of, particles, the, first, complete, quantum, field, theory, quantum, electrodynamics, provides, a, fully, quantum, description, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, quantum, electrodynamics, is, along, with, general, relativity, one, of, the, most, accurate, physical, theories, ever, devised, the, full, apparatus, of, quantum, field, theory, is, often, unnecessary, for, describing, electrodynamic, systems, a, simpler, approach, one, that, has, been, used, since, the, inception, of, quantum, mechanics, is, to, treat, charged, particles, as, quantum, mechanical, objects, being, acted, on, by, a, classical, electromagnetic, field, for, example, the, elementary, quantum, model, of, the, hydrogen, atom, describes, the, electric, field, of, the, hydrogen, atom, using, a, classical, e, 2, 4, 0, r, displaystyle, textstyle, e, 2, 4, pi, epsilon, 0, r, coulomb, potential, 285, likewise, in, a, stern, gerlach, experiment, a, charged, particle, is, modeled, as, a, quantum, system, while, the, background, magnetic, field, is, described, classically, 26, this, semi, classical, approach, fails, if, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, electromagnetic, field, play, an, important, role, such, as, in, the, emission, of, photons, by, charged, particles, quantum, field, theories, for, the, strong, nuclear, force, and, the, weak, nuclear, force, have, also, been, developed, the, quantum, field, theory, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, is, called, quantum, chromodynamics, and, describes, the, interactions, of, subnuclear, particles, such, as, quarks, and, gluons, the, weak, nuclear, force, and, the, electromagnetic, force, were, unified, in, their, quantized, forms, into, a, single, quantum, field, theory, known, as, electroweak, theory, by, the, physicists, abdus, salam, sheldon, glashow, and, steven, weinberg, even, though, the, predictions, of, both, quantum, theory, and, general, relativity, have, been, supported, by, rigorous, and, repeated, empirical, evidence, their, abstract, formalisms, contradict, each, other, and, they, have, proven, extremely, difficult, to, incorporate, into, one, consistent, cohesive, model, gravity, is, negligible, in, many, areas, of, particle, physics, so, that, unification, between, general, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, is, not, an, urgent, issue, in, those, particular, applications, however, the, lack, of, a, correct, theory, of, quantum, gravity, is, an, important, issue, in, physical, cosmology, and, the, search, by, physicists, for, an, elegant, theory, of, everything, toe, consequently, resolving, the, inconsistencies, between, both, theories, has, been, a, major, goal, of, 20th, and, 21st, century, physics, this, toe, would, combine, not, only, the, models, of, subatomic, physics, but, also, derive, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, from, a, single, force, or, phenomenon, one, proposal, for, doing, so, is, string, theory, which, posits, that, the, point, like, particles, of, particle, physics, are, replaced, by, one, dimensional, objects, called, strings, string, theory, describes, how, these, strings, propagate, through, space, and, interact, with, each, other, on, distance, scales, larger, than, the, string, scale, a, string, looks, just, like, an, ordinary, particle, with, its, mass, charge, and, other, properties, determined, by, the, vibrational, state, of, the, string, in, string, theory, one, of, the, many, vibrational, states, of, the, string, corresponds, to, the, graviton, a, quantum, mechanical, particle, that, carries, gravitational, force, another, popular, theory, is, loop, quantum, gravity, lqg, which, describes, quantum, properties, of, gravity, and, is, thus, a, theory, of, quantum, spacetime, lqg, is, an, attempt, to, merge, and, adapt, standard, quantum, mechanics, and, standard, general, relativity, this, theory, describes, space, as, an, extremely, fine, fabric, woven, of, finite, loops, called, spin, networks, the, evolution, of, a, spin, network, over, time, is, called, a, spin, foam, the, characteristic, length, scale, of, a, spin, foam, is, the, planck, length, approximately, 1, 616, 10, 35, m, and, so, lengths, shorter, than, the, planck, length, are, not, physically, meaningful, in, lqg, since, its, inception, the, many, counter, intuitive, aspects, and, results, of, quantum, mechanics, have, provoked, strong, philosophical, debates, and, many, interpretations, the, arguments, centre, on, the, probabilistic, nature, of, quantum, mechanics, the, difficulties, with, wavefunction, collapse, and, the, related, measurement, problem, and, quantum, nonlocality, perhaps, the, only, consensus, that, exists, about, these, issues, is, that, there, is, no, consensus, richard, feynman, once, said, i, think, i, can, safely, say, that, nobody, understands, quantum, mechanics, according, to, steven, weinberg, there, is, now, in, my, opinion, no, entirely, satisfactory, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, views, of, niels, bohr, werner, heisenberg, and, other, physicists, are, often, grouped, together, as, the, copenhagen, interpretation, according, to, these, views, the, probabilistic, nature, of, quantum, mechanics, is, not, a, temporary, feature, which, will, eventually, be, replaced, by, a, deterministic, theory, but, is, instead, a, final, renunciation, of, the, classical, idea, of, causality, bohr, in, particular, emphasized, that, any, well, defined, application, of, the, quantum, mechanical, formalism, must, always, make, reference, to, the, experimental, arrangement, due, to, the, complementary, nature, of, evidence, obtained, under, different, experimental, situations, copenhagen, type, interpretations, were, adopted, by, nobel, laureates, in, quantum, physics, including, bohr, heisenberg, schr, dinger, feynman, and, zeilinger, as, well, as, 21st, century, researchers, in, quantum, foundations, albert, einstein, himself, one, of, the, founders, of, quantum, theory, was, troubled, by, its, apparent, failure, to, respect, some, cherished, metaphysical, principles, such, as, determinism, and, locality, einstein, s, long, running, exchanges, with, bohr, about, the, meaning, and, status, of, quantum, mechanics, are, now, known, as, the, bohr, einstein, debates, einstein, believed, that, underlying, quantum, mechanics, must, be, a, theory, that, explicitly, forbids, action, at, a, distance, he, argued, that, quantum, mechanics, was, incomplete, a, theory, that, was, valid, but, not, fundamental, analogous, to, how, thermodynamics, is, valid, but, the, fundamental, theory, behind, it, is, statistical, mechanics, in, 1935, einstein, and, his, collaborators, boris, podolsky, and, nathan, rosen, published, an, argument, that, the, principle, of, locality, implies, the, incompleteness, of, quantum, mechanics, a, thought, experiment, later, termed, the, einstein, podolsky, rosen, paradox, in, 1964, john, bell, showed, that, epr, s, principle, of, locality, together, with, determinism, was, actually, incompatible, with, quantum, mechanics, they, implied, constraints, on, the, correlations, produced, by, distance, systems, now, known, as, bell, inequalities, that, can, be, violated, by, entangled, particles, since, then, several, experiments, have, been, performed, to, obtain, these, correlations, with, the, result, that, they, do, in, fact, violate, bell, inequalities, and, thus, falsify, the, conjunction, of, locality, with, determinism, bohmian, mechanics, shows, that, it, is, possible, to, reformulate, quantum, mechanics, to, make, it, deterministic, at, the, price, of, making, it, explicitly, nonlocal, it, attributes, not, only, a, wave, function, to, a, physical, system, but, in, addition, a, real, position, that, evolves, deterministically, under, a, nonlocal, guiding, equation, the, evolution, of, a, physical, system, is, given, at, all, times, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, together, with, the, guiding, equation, there, is, never, a, collapse, of, the, wave, function, this, solves, the, measurement, problem, everett, s, many, worlds, interpretation, formulated, in, 1956, holds, that, all, the, possibilities, described, by, quantum, theory, simultaneously, occur, in, a, multiverse, composed, of, mostly, independent, parallel, universes, this, is, a, consequence, of, removing, the, axiom, of, the, collapse, of, the, wave, packet, all, possible, states, of, the, measured, system, and, the, measuring, apparatus, together, with, the, observer, are, present, in, a, real, physical, quantum, superposition, while, the, multiverse, is, deterministic, we, perceive, non, deterministic, behavior, governed, by, probabilities, because, we, do, not, observe, the, multiverse, as, a, whole, but, only, one, parallel, universe, at, a, time, exactly, how, this, is, supposed, to, work, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, make, sense, of, this, and, derive, the, born, rule, with, no, consensus, on, whether, they, have, been, successful, relational, quantum, mechanics, appeared, in, the, late, 1990s, as, a, modern, derivative, of, copenhagen, type, ideas, and, qbism, was, developed, some, years, later, quantum, mechanics, was, developed, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, driven, by, the, need, to, explain, phenomena, that, in, some, cases, had, been, observed, in, earlier, times, scientific, inquiry, into, the, wave, nature, of, light, began, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, when, scientists, such, as, robert, hooke, christiaan, huygens, and, leonhard, euler, proposed, a, wave, theory, of, light, based, on, experimental, observations, in, 1803, english, polymath, thomas, young, described, the, famous, double, slit, experiment, this, experiment, played, a, major, role, in, the, general, acceptance, of, the, wave, theory, of, light, during, the, early, 19th, century, chemical, research, by, john, dalton, and, amedeo, avogadro, lent, weight, to, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, an, idea, that, james, clerk, maxwell, ludwig, boltzmann, and, others, built, upon, to, establish, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, the, successes, of, kinetic, theory, gave, further, credence, to, the, idea, that, matter, is, composed, of, atoms, yet, the, theory, also, had, shortcomings, that, would, only, be, resolved, by, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, while, the, early, conception, of, atoms, from, greek, philosophy, had, been, that, they, were, indivisible, units, the, word, atom, deriving, from, the, greek, for, uncuttable, the, 19th, century, saw, the, formulation, of, hypotheses, about, subatomic, structure, one, important, discovery, in, that, regard, was, michael, faraday, s, 1838, observation, of, a, glow, caused, by, an, electrical, discharge, inside, a, glass, tube, containing, gas, at, low, pressure, julius, pl, cker, johann, wilhelm, hittorf, and, eugen, goldstein, carried, on, and, improved, upon, faraday, s, work, leading, to, the, identification, of, cathode, rays, which, j, j, thomson, found, to, consist, of, subatomic, particles, that, would, be, called, electrons, the, black, body, radiation, problem, was, discovered, by, gustav, kirchhoff, in, 1859, in, 1900, max, planck, proposed, the, hypothesis, that, energy, is, radiated, and, absorbed, in, discrete, quanta, or, energy, packets, yielding, a, calculation, that, precisely, matched, the, observed, patterns, of, black, body, radiation, the, word, quantum, derives, from, the, latin, meaning, how, great, or, how, much, according, to, planck, quantities, of, energy, could, be, thought, of, as, divided, into, elements, whose, size, e, would, be, proportional, to, their, frequency, where, h, is, planck, s, constant, planck, cautiously, insisted, that, this, was, only, an, aspect, of, the, processes, of, absorption, and, emission, of, radiation, and, was, not, the, physical, reality, of, the, radiation, in, fact, he, considered, his, quantum, hypothesis, a, mathematical, trick, to, get, the, right, answer, rather, than, a, sizable, discovery, however, in, 1905, albert, einstein, interpreted, planck, s, quantum, hypothesis, realistically, and, used, it, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, in, which, shining, light, on, certain, materials, can, eject, electrons, from, the, material, niels, bohr, then, developed, planck, s, ideas, about, radiation, into, a, model, of, the, hydrogen, atom, that, successfully, predicted, the, spectral, lines, of, hydrogen, einstein, further, developed, this, idea, to, show, that, an, electromagnetic, wave, such, as, light, could, also, be, described, as, a, particle, later, called, the, photon, with, a, discrete, amount, of, energy, that, depends, on, its, frequency, in, his, paper, on, the, quantum, theory, of, radiation, einstein, expanded, on, the, interaction, between, energy, and, matter, to, explain, the, absorption, and, emission, of, energy, by, atoms, although, overshadowed, at, the, time, by, his, general, theory, of, relativity, this, paper, articulated, the, mechanism, underlying, the, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, which, became, the, basis, of, the, laser, this, phase, is, known, as, the, old, quantum, theory, never, complete, or, self, consistent, the, old, quantum, theory, was, rather, a, set, of, heuristic, corrections, to, classical, mechanics, the, theory, is, now, understood, as, a, semi, classical, approximation, to, modern, quantum, mechanics, notable, results, from, this, period, include, in, addition, to, the, work, of, planck, einstein, and, bohr, mentioned, above, einstein, and, peter, debye, s, work, on, the, specific, heat, of, solids, bohr, and, hendrika, johanna, van, leeuwen, s, proof, that, classical, physics, cannot, account, for, diamagnetism, and, arnold, sommerfeld, s, extension, of, the, bohr, model, to, include, special, relativistic, effects, in, the, mid, 1920s, quantum, mechanics, was, developed, to, become, the, standard, formulation, for, atomic, physics, in, 1923, the, french, physicist, louis, de, broglie, put, forward, his, theory, of, matter, waves, by, stating, that, particles, can, exhibit, wave, characteristics, and, vice, versa, building, on, de, broglie, s, approach, modern, quantum, mechanics, was, born, in, 1925, when, the, german, physicists, werner, heisenberg, max, born, and, pascual, jordan, developed, matrix, mechanics, and, the, austrian, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, invented, wave, mechanics, born, introduced, the, probabilistic, interpretation, of, schr, dinger, s, wave, function, in, july, 1926, thus, the, entire, field, of, quantum, physics, emerged, leading, to, its, wider, acceptance, at, the, fifth, solvay, conference, in, 1927, by, 1930, quantum, mechanics, had, been, further, unified, and, formalized, by, david, hilbert, paul, dirac, and, john, von, neumann, with, greater, emphasis, on, measurement, the, statistical, nature, of, our, knowledge, of, reality, and, philosophical, speculation, about, the, observer, it, has, since, permeated, many, disciplines, including, quantum, chemistry, quantum, electronics, quantum, optics, and, quantum, information, science, it, also, provides, a, useful, framework, for, many, features, of, the, modern, periodic, table, of, elements, and, describes, the, behaviors, of, atoms, during, chemical, bonding, and, the, flow, of, electrons, in, computer, semiconductors, and, therefore, plays, a, crucial, role, in, many, modern, technologies, while, quantum, mechanics, was, constructed, to, describe, the, world, of, the, very, small, it, is, also, needed, to, explain, some, macroscopic, phenomena, such, as, superconductors, and, superfluids, the, following, titles, all, by, working, physicists, attempt, to, communicate, quantum, theory, to, lay, people, using, a, minimum, of, technical, apparatus, more, technical, on, wikibooks
