gypsum, is, a, soft, sulfate, mineral, composed, of, calcium, sulfate, dihydrate, with, the, chemical, formula, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, it, is, widely, mined, and, is, used, as, a, fertilizer, and, as, the, main, constituent, in, many, forms, of, plaster, drywall, and, blackboard, or, sidewalk, chalk, gypsum, also, crystallizes, as, translucent, crystals, of, selenite, it, forms, as, an, evaporite, mineral, and, as, a, hydration, product, of, anhydrite, the, mohs, scale, of, mineral, hardness, defines, gypsum, as, hardness, value, 2, based, on, scratch, hardness, comparison, fine, grained, white, or, lightly, tinted, forms, of, gypsum, known, as, alabaster, have, been, used, for, sculpture, by, many, cultures, including, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, ancient, rome, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, nottingham, alabasters, of, medieval, england, the, word, gypsum, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, gypsos, plaster, because, the, quarries, of, the, montmartre, district, of, paris, have, long, furnished, burnt, gypsum, calcined, gypsum, used, for, various, purposes, this, dehydrated, gypsum, became, known, as, plaster, of, paris, upon, adding, water, after, a, few, dozen, minutes, plaster, of, paris, becomes, regular, gypsum, dihydrate, again, causing, the, material, to, harden, or, set, in, ways, that, are, useful, for, casting, and, construction, gypsum, was, known, in, old, english, as, sp, rst, n, spear, stone, referring, to, its, crystalline, projections, thus, the, word, spar, in, mineralogy, by, comparison, to, gypsum, refers, to, any, non, ore, mineral, or, crystal, that, forms, in, spearlike, projections, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, german, clergyman, and, agriculturalist, johann, friderich, mayer, investigated, and, publicized, gypsum, s, use, as, a, fertilizer, gypsum, may, act, as, a, source, of, sulfur, for, plant, growth, and, in, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, regarded, as, an, almost, miraculous, fertilizer, american, farmers, were, so, anxious, to, acquire, it, that, a, lively, smuggling, trade, with, nova, scotia, evolved, resulting, in, the, so, called, plaster, war, of, 1820, gypsum, is, moderately, water, soluble, 2, 0, 2, 5, g, l, at, 25, c, and, in, contrast, to, most, other, salts, it, exhibits, retrograde, solubility, becoming, less, soluble, at, higher, temperatures, when, gypsum, is, heated, in, air, it, loses, water, and, converts, first, to, calcium, sulfate, hemihydrate, bassanite, often, simply, called, plaster, and, if, heated, further, to, anhydrous, calcium, sulfate, anhydrite, as, with, anhydrite, the, solubility, of, gypsum, in, saline, solutions, and, in, brines, is, also, strongly, dependent, on, sodium, chloride, common, table, salt, concentration, the, structure, of, gypsum, consists, of, layers, of, calcium, ca, 2, and, sulfate, so, 2, 4, ions, tightly, bound, together, these, layers, are, bonded, by, sheets, of, anion, water, molecules, via, weaker, hydrogen, bonding, which, gives, the, crystal, perfect, cleavage, along, the, sheets, in, the, 010, plane, gypsum, occurs, in, nature, as, flattened, and, often, twinned, crystals, and, transparent, cleavable, masses, called, selenite, selenite, contains, no, significant, selenium, rather, both, substances, were, named, for, the, ancient, greek, word, for, the, moon, selenite, may, also, occur, in, a, silky, fibrous, form, in, which, case, it, is, commonly, called, satin, spar, finally, it, may, also, be, granular, or, quite, compact, in, hand, sized, samples, it, can, be, anywhere, from, transparent, to, opaque, a, very, fine, grained, white, or, lightly, tinted, variety, of, gypsum, called, alabaster, is, prized, for, ornamental, work, of, various, sorts, in, arid, areas, gypsum, can, occur, in, a, flower, like, form, typically, opaque, with, embedded, sand, grains, called, desert, rose, it, also, forms, some, of, the, largest, crystals, found, in, nature, up, to, 12, m, 39, ft, long, in, the, form, of, selenite, gypsum, is, a, common, mineral, with, thick, and, extensive, evaporite, beds, in, association, with, sedimentary, rocks, deposits, are, known, to, occur, in, strata, from, as, far, back, as, the, archaean, eon, gypsum, is, deposited, from, lake, and, sea, water, as, well, as, in, hot, springs, from, volcanic, vapors, and, sulfate, solutions, in, veins, hydrothermal, anhydrite, in, veins, is, commonly, hydrated, to, gypsum, by, groundwater, in, near, surface, exposures, it, is, often, associated, with, the, minerals, halite, and, sulfur, gypsum, is, the, most, common, sulfate, mineral, pure, gypsum, is, white, but, other, substances, found, as, impurities, may, give, a, wide, range, of, colors, to, local, deposits, because, gypsum, dissolves, over, time, in, water, gypsum, is, rarely, found, in, the, form, of, sand, however, the, unique, conditions, of, the, white, sands, national, park, in, the, us, state, of, new, mexico, have, created, a, 710, km, 2, 270, sq, mi, expanse, of, white, gypsum, sand, enough, to, supply, the, us, construction, industry, with, drywall, for, 1, 000, years, commercial, exploitation, of, the, area, strongly, opposed, by, area, residents, was, permanently, prevented, in, 1933, when, president, herbert, hoover, declared, the, gypsum, dunes, a, protected, national, monument, gypsum, is, also, formed, as, a, by, product, of, sulfide, oxidation, amongst, others, by, pyrite, oxidation, when, the, sulfuric, acid, generated, reacts, with, calcium, carbonate, its, presence, indicates, oxidizing, conditions, under, reducing, conditions, the, sulfates, it, contains, can, be, reduced, back, to, sulfide, by, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, this, can, lead, to, accumulation, of, elemental, sulfur, in, oil, bearing, formations, such, as, salt, domes, where, it, can, be, mined, using, the, frasch, process, electric, power, stations, burning, coal, with, flue, gas, desulfurization, produce, large, quantities, of, gypsum, as, a, byproduct, from, the, scrubbers, orbital, pictures, from, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, mro, have, indicated, the, existence, of, gypsum, dunes, in, the, northern, polar, region, of, mars, which, were, later, confirmed, at, ground, level, by, the, mars, exploration, rover, mer, opportunity, commercial, quantities, of, gypsum, are, found, in, the, cities, of, araripina, and, graja, in, brazil, in, pakistan, jamaica, iran, world, s, second, largest, producer, thailand, spain, the, main, producer, in, europe, germany, italy, england, ireland, canada, and, the, united, states, large, open, pit, quarries, are, located, in, many, places, including, fort, dodge, iowa, which, sits, on, one, of, the, largest, deposits, of, gypsum, in, the, world, and, plaster, city, california, united, states, and, east, kutai, kalimantan, indonesia, several, small, mines, also, exist, in, places, such, as, kalannie, in, western, australia, where, gypsum, is, sold, to, private, buyers, for, additions, of, calcium, and, sulfur, as, well, as, reduction, of, aluminum, toxicities, on, soil, for, agricultural, purposes, crystals, of, gypsum, up, to, 11, m, 36, ft, long, have, been, found, in, the, caves, of, the, naica, mine, of, chihuahua, mexico, the, crystals, thrived, in, the, cave, s, extremely, rare, and, stable, natural, environment, temperatures, stayed, at, 58, c, 136, f, and, the, cave, was, filled, with, mineral, rich, water, that, drove, the, crystals, growth, the, largest, of, those, crystals, weighs, 55, tonnes, 61, short, tons, and, is, around, 500, 000, years, old, synthetic, gypsum, is, produced, as, a, waste, product, or, by, product, in, a, range, of, industrial, processes, flue, gas, desulfurization, gypsum, fgdg, is, recovered, at, some, coal, fired, power, plants, the, main, contaminants, are, mg, k, cl, f, b, al, fe, si, and, se, they, come, both, from, the, limestone, used, in, desulfurization, and, from, the, coal, burned, this, product, is, pure, enough, to, replace, natural, gypsum, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, including, drywalls, water, treatment, and, cement, set, retarder, improvements, in, flue, gas, desulfurization, have, greatly, reduced, the, amount, of, toxic, elements, present, gypsum, precipitates, onto, brackish, water, membranes, a, phenomenon, known, as, mineral, salt, scaling, such, as, during, brackish, water, desalination, of, water, with, high, concentrations, of, calcium, and, sulfate, scaling, decreases, membrane, life, and, productivity, this, is, one, of, the, main, obstacles, in, brackish, water, membrane, desalination, processes, such, as, reverse, osmosis, or, nanofiltration, other, forms, of, scaling, such, as, calcite, scaling, depending, on, the, water, source, can, also, be, important, considerations, in, distillation, as, well, as, in, heat, exchangers, where, either, the, salt, solubility, or, concentration, can, change, rapidly, a, new, study, has, suggested, that, the, formation, of, gypsum, starts, as, tiny, crystals, of, a, mineral, called, bassanite, 2caso, 4, h, 2, o, this, process, occurs, via, a, three, stage, pathway, the, production, of, phosphate, fertilizers, requires, breaking, down, calcium, containing, phosphate, rock, with, acid, producing, calcium, sulfate, waste, known, as, phosphogypsum, pg, this, form, of, gypsum, is, contaminated, by, impurities, found, in, the, rock, namely, fluoride, silica, radioactive, elements, such, as, radium, and, heavy, metal, elements, such, as, cadmium, similarly, production, of, titanium, dioxide, produces, titanium, gypsum, tg, due, to, neutralization, of, excess, acid, with, lime, the, product, is, contaminated, with, silica, fluorides, organic, matters, and, alkalis, impurities, in, refinery, gypsum, waste, have, in, many, cases, prevented, them, from, being, used, as, normal, gypsum, in, fields, such, as, construction, as, a, result, waste, gypsum, is, stored, in, stacks, indefinitely, with, significant, risk, of, leaching, their, contaminants, into, water, and, soil, to, reduce, the, accumulation, and, ultimately, clear, out, these, stacks, research, is, underway, to, find, more, applications, for, such, waste, products, people, can, be, exposed, to, gypsum, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, it, in, skin, contact, and, eye, contact, calcium, sulfate, per, se, is, nontoxic, and, is, even, approved, as, a, food, additive, but, as, powdered, gypsum, it, can, irritate, skin, and, mucous, membranes, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, gypsum, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, twa, 15, mg, m, 3, for, total, exposure, and, twa, 5, mg, m, 3, for, respiratory, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, twa, 10, mg, m, 3, for, total, exposure, and, twa, 5, mg, m, 3, for, respiratory, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, gypsum, is, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications
