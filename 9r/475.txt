calcium, chloride, is, an, inorganic, compound, a, salt, with, the, chemical, formula, cacl, 2, it, is, a, white, crystalline, solid, at, room, temperature, and, it, is, highly, soluble, in, water, it, can, be, created, by, neutralising, hydrochloric, acid, with, calcium, hydroxide, calcium, chloride, is, commonly, encountered, as, a, hydrated, solid, with, generic, formula, cacl, 2, n, h, 2, o, where, n, 0, 1, 2, 4, and, 6, these, compounds, are, mainly, used, for, de, icing, and, dust, control, because, the, anhydrous, salt, is, hygroscopic, and, deliquescent, it, is, used, as, a, desiccant, mad, calcium, chloride, was, apparently, discovered, in, the, 15th, century, but, wasn, t, studied, properly, until, the, 18th, century, it, was, historically, called, fixed, sal, ammoniac, latin, sal, ammoniacum, fixum, because, it, was, synthesized, during, the, distillation, of, ammonium, chloride, with, lime, and, was, nonvolatile, while, the, former, appeared, to, sublime, in, more, modern, times, 18th, 19th, cc, it, was, called, muriate, of, lime, latin, murias, calcis, calcaria, muriatica, by, depressing, the, freezing, point, of, water, calcium, chloride, is, used, to, prevent, ice, formation, and, is, used, to, de, ice, this, application, consumes, the, greatest, amount, of, calcium, chloride, calcium, chloride, is, relatively, harmless, to, plants, and, soil, as, a, de, icing, agent, it, is, much, more, effective, at, lower, temperatures, than, sodium, chloride, when, distributed, for, this, use, it, usually, takes, the, form, of, small, white, spheres, a, few, millimeters, in, diameter, called, prills, solutions, of, calcium, chloride, can, prevent, freezing, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 52, c, 62, f, making, it, ideal, for, filling, agricultural, implement, tires, as, a, liquid, ballast, aiding, traction, in, cold, climates, it, is, also, used, in, domestic, and, industrial, chemical, air, dehumidifiers, the, second, largest, application, of, calcium, chloride, exploits, its, hygroscopic, nature, and, the, tackiness, of, its, hydrates, calcium, chloride, is, highly, hygroscopic, and, its, hydration, is, an, exothermic, process, a, concentrated, solution, keeps, a, liquid, layer, on, the, surface, of, dirt, roads, which, suppresses, the, formation, of, dust, it, keeps, the, finer, dust, particles, on, the, road, providing, a, cushioning, layer, if, these, are, allowed, to, blow, away, the, large, aggregate, begins, to, shift, around, and, the, road, breaks, down, using, calcium, chloride, reduces, the, need, for, grading, by, as, much, as, 50, and, the, need, for, fill, in, materials, as, much, as, 80, in, the, food, industry, calcium, chloride, is, frequently, employed, as, a, firming, agent, in, canned, vegetables, particularly, for, canned, tomatoes, and, cucumber, pickles, it, is, also, used, in, firming, soybean, curds, into, tofu, and, in, producing, a, caviar, substitute, from, vegetable, or, fruit, juices, it, is, also, used, to, enhance, the, texture, of, various, other, products, such, as, whole, apples, whole, hot, peppers, whole, and, sliced, strawberries, diced, tomatoes, and, whole, peaches, the, firming, effect, of, calcium, chloride, can, be, attributed, to, several, mechanisms, calcium, chloride, s, freezing, point, depression, properties, are, used, to, slow, the, freezing, of, the, caramel, in, caramel, filled, chocolate, bars, also, it, is, frequently, added, to, sliced, apples, to, maintain, texture, in, brewing, beer, calcium, chloride, is, sometimes, used, to, correct, mineral, deficiencies, in, the, brewing, water, it, affects, flavor, and, chemical, reactions, during, the, brewing, process, and, can, also, affect, yeast, function, during, fermentation, in, cheesemaking, calcium, chloride, is, sometimes, added, to, processed, pasteurized, homogenized, milk, to, restore, the, natural, balance, between, calcium, and, protein, in, casein, it, is, added, before, the, coagulant, calcium, chloride, is, also, commonly, used, as, an, electrolyte, in, sports, drinks, and, other, beverages, as, a, food, additive, used, in, conjunction, with, other, inorganic, salts, it, adds, taste, to, bottled, water, the, average, intake, of, calcium, chloride, as, food, additives, has, been, estimated, to, be, 160, 345, mg, day, calcium, chloride, is, permitted, as, a, food, additive, in, the, european, union, for, use, as, a, sequestrant, and, firming, agent, with, the, e, number, e509, it, is, considered, as, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, its, use, in, organic, crop, production, is, generally, prohibited, under, the, us, national, organic, program, calcium, chloride, contains, approximately, 27, 2, or, 272, mg, of, elemental, calcium, per, gram, this, means, that, for, every, gram, of, calcium, chloride, there, are, 272, mg, of, actual, absorbable, calcium, calcium, chloride, has, a, very, salty, taste, and, can, cause, mouth, and, throat, irritation, at, high, concentrations, so, it, is, typically, not, the, first, choice, for, long, term, oral, supplementation, as, a, calcium, supplement, calcium, chloride, characterized, by, its, low, molecular, weight, and, high, water, solubility, readily, breaks, down, into, calcium, and, chloride, ions, when, exposed, to, water, these, ions, are, efficiently, absorbed, from, the, intestine, however, caution, should, be, exercised, when, handling, calcium, chloride, for, it, has, the, potential, to, release, heat, energy, upon, dissolution, in, water, this, release, of, heat, can, lead, to, trauma, and, burns, in, the, mouth, throat, esophagus, and, stomach, in, fact, there, have, been, reported, cases, of, stomach, necrosis, resulting, from, burns, caused, by, accidental, ingestions, of, big, amounts, of, dry, calcium, chloride, the, extremely, salty, taste, of, calcium, chloride, is, used, to, flavor, pickles, without, increasing, the, food, s, sodium, content, calcium, chloride, is, used, to, prevent, cork, spot, and, bitter, pit, on, apples, by, spraying, on, the, tree, during, the, late, growing, season, drying, tubes, are, frequently, packed, with, calcium, chloride, kelp, is, dried, with, calcium, chloride, for, use, in, producing, sodium, carbonate, anhydrous, calcium, chloride, has, been, approved, by, the, fda, as, a, packaging, aid, to, ensure, dryness, cpg, 7117, 02, the, hydrated, salt, can, be, dried, for, re, use, but, will, dissolve, in, its, own, water, of, hydration, if, heated, quickly, and, form, a, hard, amalgamated, solid, when, cooled, similarly, cacl, 2, is, used, as, a, flux, and, electrolyte, in, the, ffc, cambridge, electrolysis, process, for, titanium, production, where, it, ensures, the, proper, exchange, of, calcium, and, oxygen, ions, between, the, electrodes, calcium, chloride, infusions, may, be, used, as, an, intravenous, therapy, to, prevent, hypocalcemia, calcium, chloride, is, used, in, concrete, mixes, to, accelerate, the, initial, setting, but, chloride, ions, lead, to, corrosion, of, steel, rebar, so, it, should, not, be, used, in, reinforced, concrete, the, anhydrous, form, of, calcium, chloride, may, also, be, used, for, this, purpose, and, can, provide, a, measure, of, the, moisture, in, concrete, calcium, chloride, is, included, as, an, additive, in, plastics, and, in, fire, extinguishers, in, blast, furnaces, as, an, additive, to, control, scaffolding, clumping, and, adhesion, of, materials, that, prevent, the, furnace, charge, from, descending, and, in, fabric, softener, as, a, thinner, the, exothermic, dissolution, of, calcium, chloride, is, used, in, self, heating, cans, and, heating, pads, calcium, chloride, is, used, as, a, water, hardener, in, the, maintenance, of, hot, tub, water, as, insufficiently, hard, water, can, lead, to, corrosion, and, foaming, in, the, oil, industry, calcium, chloride, is, used, to, increase, the, density, of, solids, free, brines, it, is, also, used, to, provide, inhibition, of, swelling, clays, in, the, water, phase, of, invert, emulsion, drilling, fluids, cacl, 2, acts, as, flux, material, decreasing, the, melting, point, in, the, davy, process, for, the, industrial, production, of, sodium, metal, through, the, electrolysis, of, molten, nacl, calcium, chloride, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, activated, charcoal, calcium, chloride, can, be, used, to, precipitate, fluoride, ions, from, water, as, insoluble, caf, 2, calcium, chloride, is, also, an, ingredient, used, in, ceramic, slipware, it, suspends, clay, particles, so, that, they, float, within, the, solution, making, it, easier, to, use, in, a, variety, of, slipcasting, techniques, calcium, chloride, dihydrate, 20, percent, by, weight, dissolved, in, ethanol, 95, percent, abv, has, been, used, as, a, sterilant, for, male, animals, the, solution, is, injected, into, the, testes, of, the, animal, within, one, month, necrosis, of, testicular, tissue, results, in, sterilization, cocaine, producers, in, colombia, import, tons, of, calcium, chloride, to, recover, solvents, that, are, on, the, incb, red, list, and, are, more, tightly, controlled, although, the, salt, is, non, toxic, in, small, quantities, when, wet, the, strongly, hygroscopic, properties, of, non, hydrated, calcium, chloride, present, some, hazards, it, can, act, as, an, irritant, by, desiccating, moist, skin, solid, calcium, chloride, dissolves, exothermically, and, burns, can, result, in, the, mouth, and, esophagus, if, it, is, ingested, ingestion, of, concentrated, solutions, or, solid, products, may, cause, gastrointestinal, irritation, or, ulceration, consumption, of, calcium, chloride, can, lead, to, hypercalcemia, calcium, chloride, dissolves, in, water, producing, chloride, and, the, aquo, complex, 2, in, this, way, these, solutions, are, sources, of, free, calcium, and, free, chloride, ions, this, description, is, illustrated, by, the, fact, that, these, solutions, react, with, phosphate, sources, to, give, a, solid, precipitate, of, calcium, phosphate, calcium, chloride, has, a, very, high, enthalpy, change, of, solution, indicated, by, considerable, temperature, rise, accompanying, dissolution, of, the, anhydrous, salt, in, water, this, property, is, the, basis, for, its, largest, scale, application, molten, calcium, chloride, can, be, electrolysed, to, give, calcium, metal, and, chlorine, gas, in, much, of, the, world, calcium, chloride, is, derived, from, limestone, as, a, by, product, of, the, solvay, process, which, follows, the, net, reaction, below, north, american, consumption, in, 2002, was, 1, 529, 000, tonnes, 3, 37, billion, pounds, in, the, us, most, calcium, chloride, is, obtained, by, purification, from, brine, as, with, most, bulk, commodity, salt, products, trace, amounts, of, other, cations, from, the, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, groups, 1, and, 2, and, other, anions, from, the, halogens, group, 17, typically, occur, calcium, chloride, occurs, as, the, rare, evaporite, minerals, sinjarite, dihydrate, and, antarcticite, hexahydrate, another, natural, hydrate, known, is, ghiaraite, a, tetrahydrate, the, related, minerals, chlorocalcite, potassium, calcium, chloride, kcacl, 3, and, tachyhydrite, calcium, magnesium, chloride, ca, mg, 2, cl, 6, 12, h, 2, o, are, also, very, rare, the, same, is, true, for, rorisite, caclf, calcium, chloride, fluoride
