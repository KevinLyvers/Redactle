sedimentary, basins, are, region, scale, depressions, of, the, earth, s, crust, where, subsidence, has, occurred, and, a, thick, sequence, of, sediments, have, accumulated, to, form, a, large, three, dimensional, body, of, sedimentary, rock, they, form, when, long, term, subsidence, creates, a, regional, depression, that, provides, accommodation, space, for, accumulation, of, sediments, over, millions, or, tens, or, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, the, deposition, of, sediment, primarily, gravity, driven, transportation, of, water, borne, eroded, material, acts, to, fill, the, depression, as, the, sediments, are, buried, they, are, subject, to, increasing, pressure, and, begin, the, processes, of, compaction, and, lithification, that, transform, them, into, sedimentary, rock, sedimentary, basins, are, created, by, deformation, of, earth, s, lithosphere, in, diverse, geological, settings, usually, as, a, result, of, plate, tectonic, activity, mechanisms, of, crustal, deformation, that, lead, to, subsidence, and, sedimentary, basin, formation, include, the, thinning, of, underlying, crust, depression, of, the, crust, by, sedimentary, tectonic, or, volcanic, loading, or, changes, in, the, thickness, or, density, of, underlying, or, adjacent, lithosphere, once, the, process, of, basin, formation, has, begun, the, weight, of, the, sediments, being, deposited, in, the, basin, adds, a, further, load, on, the, underlying, crust, that, accentuates, subsidence, and, thus, amplifies, basin, development, as, a, result, of, isostasy, the, long, term, preserved, geologic, record, of, a, sedimentary, basin, is, a, large, scale, contiguous, three, dimensional, package, of, sedimentary, rocks, created, during, a, particular, period, of, geologic, time, a, stratigraphic, succession, that, geologists, continue, to, refer, to, as, a, sedimentary, basin, even, if, it, is, no, longer, a, bathymetric, or, topographic, depression, the, williston, basin, molasse, basin, and, magallanes, basin, are, examples, of, sedimentary, basins, that, are, no, longer, depressions, basins, formed, in, different, tectonic, regimes, vary, in, their, preservation, potential, intracratonic, basins, which, form, on, highly, stable, continental, interiors, have, a, high, probability, of, preservation, in, contrast, sedimentary, basins, formed, on, oceanic, crust, are, likely, to, be, destroyed, by, subduction, continental, margins, formed, when, new, ocean, basins, like, the, atlantic, are, created, as, continents, rift, apart, are, likely, to, have, lifespans, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, but, may, be, only, partially, preserved, when, those, ocean, basins, close, as, continents, collide, sedimentary, basins, are, of, great, economic, importance, almost, all, the, world, s, natural, gas, and, petroleum, and, all, of, its, coal, are, found, in, sedimentary, rock, many, metal, ores, are, found, in, sedimentary, rocks, formed, in, particular, sedimentary, environments, sedimentary, basins, are, also, important, from, a, purely, scientific, perspective, because, their, sedimentary, fill, provides, a, record, of, earth, s, history, during, the, time, in, which, the, basin, was, actively, receiving, sediment, more, than, six, hundred, sedimentary, basins, have, been, identified, worldwide, they, range, in, areal, size, from, tens, of, square, kilometers, to, well, over, a, million, and, their, sedimentary, fills, range, from, one, to, almost, twenty, kilometers, in, thickness, a, dozen, or, so, common, types, of, sedimentary, basins, are, widely, recognized, and, several, classification, schemes, are, proposed, however, no, single, classification, scheme, is, recognized, as, the, standard, most, sedimentary, basin, classification, schemes, are, based, on, one, or, more, of, these, interrelated, criteria, although, no, one, basin, classification, scheme, has, been, widely, adopted, several, common, types, of, sedimentary, basins, are, widely, accepted, and, well, understood, as, distinct, types, over, its, complete, lifespan, a, single, sedimentary, basin, can, go, through, multiple, phases, and, evolve, from, one, of, these, types, to, another, such, as, a, rift, process, going, to, completion, to, form, a, passive, margin, in, this, case, the, sedimentary, rocks, of, the, rift, basin, phase, are, overlain, by, those, rocks, deposited, during, the, passive, margin, phase, hybrid, basins, where, a, single, regional, basin, results, from, the, processes, that, are, characteristic, of, multiple, of, these, types, are, also, possible, terrestrial, rift, valleys, proto, oceanic, rift, troughs, passive, margins, are, long, lived, and, generally, become, inactive, only, as, a, result, of, the, closing, of, a, major, ocean, through, continental, collision, resulting, from, plate, tectonics, as, a, result, the, sedimentary, record, of, inactive, passive, margins, often, are, found, as, thick, sedimentary, sequences, in, mountain, belts, for, example, the, passive, margins, of, the, ancient, tethys, ocean, are, found, in, the, mountain, belts, of, the, alps, and, himalayas, that, formed, when, the, tethys, closed, many, authors, recognize, two, subtypes, of, foreland, basins, peripheral, foreland, basins, retroarc, foreland, basins, a, sedimentary, basin, formed, in, association, with, a, convergent, plate, tectonic, boundary, in, the, gap, between, an, active, volcanic, arc, and, the, associated, trench, thus, above, the, subducting, oceanic, plate, the, formation, of, a, forearc, basin, is, often, created, by, the, vertical, growth, of, an, accretionary, wedge, that, acts, as, a, linear, dam, parallel, to, the, volcanic, arc, creating, a, depression, in, which, sediments, can, accumulate, trench, basins, are, deep, linear, depressions, formed, where, a, subducting, oceanic, plate, descends, into, the, mantle, beneath, the, overriding, continental, andean, type, or, oceanic, plate, mariana, type, trenches, form, in, the, deep, ocean, but, particularly, where, the, overriding, plate, is, continental, crust, they, can, accumulate, thick, sequences, of, sediments, from, eroding, coastal, mountains, smaller, trench, slope, basins, can, form, in, association, with, a, trench, can, form, directly, atop, the, associated, accretionary, prism, as, it, grows, and, changes, shape, creating, ponded, basins, pull, apart, basins, is, are, created, along, major, strike, slip, faults, where, a, bend, in, the, fault, geometry, or, the, splitting, of, the, fault, into, two, or, more, faults, creates, tensional, forces, that, cause, crustal, thinning, or, stretching, due, to, extension, creating, a, regional, depression, frequently, the, basins, are, rhombic, s, like, or, z, like, in, shape, a, broad, comparatively, shallow, basin, formed, far, from, the, edge, of, a, continental, craton, as, a, result, of, prolonged, broadly, distributed, but, slow, subsidence, of, the, continental, lithosphere, relative, to, the, surrounding, area, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, intracratonic, sag, basins, they, tend, to, be, subcircular, in, shape, and, are, commonly, filled, with, shallow, water, marine, or, terrestrial, sedimentary, rocks, that, remain, flat, lying, and, relatively, undeformed, over, long, periods, of, time, due, to, the, long, lived, tectonic, stability, of, the, underlying, craton, the, geodynamic, forces, that, create, them, remain, poorly, understood, sedimentary, basins, form, as, a, result, of, regional, subsidence, of, the, lithosphere, mostly, as, a, result, of, a, few, geodynamic, processes, if, the, lithosphere, is, caused, to, stretch, horizontally, by, mechanisms, such, as, rifting, which, is, associated, with, divergent, plate, boundaries, or, ridge, push, or, trench, pull, associated, with, convergent, boundaries, the, effect, is, believed, to, be, twofold, the, lower, hotter, part, of, the, lithosphere, will, flow, slowly, away, from, the, main, area, being, stretched, whilst, the, upper, cooler, and, more, brittle, crust, will, tend, to, fault, crack, and, fracture, the, combined, effect, of, these, two, mechanisms, is, for, earth, s, surface, in, the, area, of, extension, to, subside, creating, a, geographical, depression, which, is, then, often, infilled, with, water, and, or, sediments, an, analogy, is, a, piece, of, rubber, which, thins, in, the, middle, when, stretched, an, example, of, a, basin, caused, by, lithospheric, stretching, is, the, north, sea, also, an, important, location, for, significant, hydrocarbon, reserves, another, such, feature, is, the, basin, and, range, province, which, covers, most, of, nevada, forming, a, series, of, horst, and, graben, structures, tectonic, extension, at, divergent, boundaries, where, continental, rifting, is, occurring, can, create, a, nascent, ocean, basin, leading, to, either, an, ocean, or, the, failure, of, the, rift, zone, another, expression, of, lithospheric, stretching, results, in, the, formation, of, ocean, basins, with, central, ridges, the, red, sea, is, in, fact, an, incipient, ocean, in, a, plate, tectonic, context, the, mouth, of, the, red, sea, is, also, a, tectonic, triple, junction, where, the, indian, ocean, ridge, red, sea, rift, and, east, african, rift, meet, this, is, the, only, place, on, the, planet, where, such, a, triple, junction, in, oceanic, crust, is, exposed, subaerially, this, is, due, to, a, high, thermal, buoyancy, thermal, subsidence, of, the, junction, and, also, to, a, local, crumpled, zone, of, seafloor, crust, acting, as, a, dam, against, the, red, sea, lithospheric, flexure, is, another, geodynamic, mechanism, that, can, cause, regional, subsidence, resulting, in, the, creation, of, a, sedimentary, basin, if, a, load, is, placed, on, the, lithosphere, it, will, tend, to, flex, in, the, manner, of, an, elastic, plate, the, magnitude, of, the, lithospheric, flexure, is, a, function, of, the, imposed, load, and, the, flexural, rigidity, of, the, lithosphere, and, the, wavelength, of, flexure, is, a, function, of, flexural, rigidity, of, the, lithospheric, plate, flexural, rigidity, is, in, itself, a, function, of, the, lithospheric, mineral, composition, thermal, regime, and, effective, elastic, thickness, of, the, lithosphere, plate, tectonic, processes, that, can, create, sufficient, loads, on, the, lithosphere, to, induce, basin, forming, processes, include, after, any, kind, of, sedimentary, basin, has, begun, to, form, the, load, created, by, the, water, and, sediments, filling, the, basin, creates, additional, load, thus, causing, additional, lithospheric, flexure, and, amplifying, the, original, subsidence, that, created, the, basin, regardless, of, the, original, cause, of, basin, inception, cooling, of, a, lithospheric, plate, particularly, young, oceanic, crust, or, recently, stretched, continental, crust, causes, thermal, subsidence, as, the, plate, cools, it, shrinks, and, becomes, denser, through, thermal, contraction, analogous, to, a, solid, floating, in, a, liquid, as, the, lithospheric, plate, gets, denser, it, sinks, because, it, displaces, more, of, the, underlying, mantle, through, an, equilibrium, process, known, as, isostasy, thermal, subsidence, is, particularly, measurable, and, observable, with, oceanic, crust, as, there, is, a, well, established, correlation, between, the, age, of, the, underlying, crust, and, depth, of, the, ocean, as, newly, formed, oceanic, crust, cools, over, a, period, of, tens, of, millions, of, years, this, is, an, important, contribution, to, subsidence, in, rift, basins, backarc, basins, and, passive, margins, where, they, are, underlain, by, newly, formed, oceanic, crust, in, strike, slip, tectonic, settings, deformation, of, the, lithosphere, occurs, primarily, in, the, plane, of, earth, as, a, result, of, near, horizontal, maximum, and, minimum, principal, stresses, faults, associated, with, these, plate, boundaries, are, primarily, vertical, wherever, these, vertical, fault, planes, encounter, bends, movement, along, the, fault, can, create, local, areas, of, compression, or, tension, when, the, curve, in, the, fault, plane, moves, apart, a, region, of, transtension, occurs, and, sometimes, is, large, enough, and, long, lived, enough, to, create, a, sedimentary, basin, often, called, a, pull, apart, basin, or, strike, slip, basin, these, basins, are, often, roughly, rhombohedral, in, shape, and, may, be, called, a, rhombochasm, a, classic, rhombochasm, is, illustrated, by, the, dead, sea, rift, where, northward, movement, of, the, arabian, plate, relative, to, the, anatolian, plate, has, created, a, strike, slip, basin, the, opposite, effect, is, that, of, transpression, where, converging, movement, of, a, curved, fault, plane, causes, collision, of, the, opposing, sides, of, the, fault, an, example, is, the, san, bernardino, mountains, north, of, los, angeles, which, result, from, convergence, along, a, curve, in, the, san, andreas, fault, system, the, northridge, earthquake, was, caused, by, vertical, movement, along, local, thrust, and, reverse, faults, bunching, up, against, the, bend, in, the, otherwise, strike, slip, fault, environment, the, study, of, sedimentary, basins, as, entities, unto, themselves, is, often, referred, to, as, sedimentary, basin, analysis, study, involving, quantitative, modeling, of, the, dynamic, geologic, processes, by, which, they, evolved, is, called, basin, modelling, the, sedimentary, rocks, comprising, the, fill, of, sedimentary, basins, hold, the, most, complete, historical, record, of, the, evolution, of, the, earth, s, surface, over, time, regional, study, of, these, rocks, can, be, used, as, the, primary, record, for, different, kinds, of, scientific, investigation, aimed, at, understanding, and, reconstructing, the, earth, s, past, plate, tectonics, paleotectonics, geography, paleogeography, climate, paleoclimatology, oceans, paleoceanography, habitats, paleoecology, and, paleobiogeography, sedimentary, basin, analysis, is, thus, an, important, area, of, study, for, purely, scientific, and, academic, reasons, there, are, however, important, economic, incentives, as, well, for, understanding, the, processes, of, sedimentary, basin, formation, and, evolution, because, almost, all, of, the, world, s, fossil, fuel, reserves, were, formed, in, sedimentary, basins, all, of, these, perspectives, on, the, history, of, a, particular, region, are, based, on, the, study, of, a, large, three, dimensional, body, of, sedimentary, rocks, that, resulted, from, the, fill, of, one, or, more, sedimentary, basins, over, time, the, scientific, studies, of, stratigraphy, and, in, recent, decades, sequence, stratigraphy, are, focused, on, understanding, the, three, dimensional, architecture, packaging, and, layering, of, this, body, of, sedimentary, rocks, as, a, record, resulting, from, sedimentary, processes, acting, over, time, influenced, by, global, sea, level, change, and, regional, plate, tectonics, where, the, sedimentary, rocks, comprising, a, sedimentary, basin, s, fill, are, exposed, at, the, earth, s, surface, traditional, field, geology, and, aerial, photography, techniques, as, well, as, satellite, imagery, can, be, used, in, the, study, of, sedimentary, basins, much, of, a, sedimentary, basin, s, fill, often, remains, buried, below, the, surface, often, submerged, in, the, ocean, and, thus, cannot, be, studied, directly, acoustic, imaging, using, seismic, reflection, acquired, through, seismic, data, acquisition, and, studied, through, the, specific, sub, discipline, of, seismic, stratigraphy, is, the, primary, means, of, understanding, the, three, dimensional, architecture, of, the, basin, s, fill, through, remote, sensing, direct, sampling, of, the, rocks, themselves, is, accomplished, via, the, drilling, of, boreholes, and, the, retrieval, of, rock, samples, in, the, form, of, both, core, samples, and, drill, cuttings, these, allow, geologists, to, study, small, samples, of, the, rocks, directly, and, also, very, importantly, allow, paleontologists, to, study, the, microfossils, they, contain, micropaleontology, at, the, time, they, are, being, drilled, boreholes, are, also, surveyed, by, pulling, electronic, instruments, along, the, length, of, the, borehole, in, a, process, known, as, well, logging, well, logging, which, is, sometimes, appropriately, called, borehole, geophysics, uses, electromagnetic, and, radioactive, properties, of, the, rocks, surrounding, the, borehole, as, well, as, their, interaction, with, the, fluids, used, in, the, process, of, drilling, the, borehole, to, create, a, continuous, record, of, the, rocks, along, the, length, of, the, borehole, displayed, as, of, a, family, of, curves, comparison, of, well, log, curves, between, multiple, boreholes, can, be, used, to, understand, the, stratigraphy, of, a, sedimentary, basin, particularly, if, used, in, conjunction, with, seismic, stratigraphy
