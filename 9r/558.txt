geology, from, ancient, greek, g, earth, and, o, log, a, study, of, discourse, is, a, branch, of, natural, science, concerned, with, the, earth, and, other, astronomical, objects, the, rocks, of, which, they, are, composed, and, the, processes, by, which, they, change, over, time, modern, geology, significantly, overlaps, all, other, earth, sciences, including, hydrology, it, is, integrated, with, earth, system, science, and, planetary, science, geology, describes, the, structure, of, the, earth, on, and, beneath, its, surface, and, the, processes, that, have, shaped, that, structure, geologists, study, the, mineralogical, composition, of, rocks, in, order, to, get, insight, into, their, history, of, formation, geology, determines, the, relative, ages, of, rocks, found, at, a, given, location, geochemistry, a, branch, of, geology, determines, their, absolute, ages, by, combining, various, petrological, crystallographic, and, paleontological, tools, geologists, are, able, to, chronicle, the, geological, history, of, the, earth, as, a, whole, one, aspect, is, to, demonstrate, the, age, of, the, earth, geology, provides, evidence, for, plate, tectonics, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, and, the, earth, s, past, climates, geologists, broadly, study, the, properties, and, processes, of, earth, and, other, terrestrial, planets, geologists, use, a, wide, variety, of, methods, to, understand, the, earth, s, structure, and, evolution, including, fieldwork, rock, description, geophysical, techniques, chemical, analysis, physical, experiments, and, numerical, modelling, in, practical, terms, geology, is, important, for, mineral, and, hydrocarbon, exploration, and, exploitation, evaluating, water, resources, understanding, natural, hazards, remediating, environmental, problems, and, providing, insights, into, past, climate, change, geology, is, a, major, academic, discipline, and, it, is, central, to, geological, engineering, and, plays, an, important, role, in, geotechnical, engineering, the, majority, of, geological, data, comes, from, research, on, solid, earth, materials, meteorites, and, other, extraterrestrial, natural, materials, are, also, studied, by, geological, methods, minerals, are, naturally, occurring, elements, and, compounds, with, a, definite, homogeneous, chemical, composition, and, an, ordered, atomic, arrangement, each, mineral, has, distinct, physical, properties, and, there, are, many, tests, to, determine, each, of, them, minerals, are, often, identified, through, these, tests, the, specimens, can, be, tested, for, a, rock, is, any, naturally, occurring, solid, mass, or, aggregate, of, minerals, or, mineraloids, most, research, in, geology, is, associated, with, the, study, of, rocks, as, they, provide, the, primary, record, of, the, majority, of, the, geological, history, of, the, earth, there, are, three, major, types, of, rock, igneous, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, the, rock, cycle, illustrates, the, relationships, among, them, see, diagram, when, a, rock, solidifies, or, crystallizes, from, melt, magma, or, lava, it, is, an, igneous, rock, this, rock, can, be, weathered, and, eroded, then, redeposited, and, lithified, into, a, sedimentary, rock, sedimentary, rocks, are, mainly, divided, into, four, categories, sandstone, shale, carbonate, and, evaporite, this, group, of, classifications, focuses, partly, on, the, size, of, sedimentary, particles, sandstone, and, shale, and, partly, on, mineralogy, and, formation, processes, carbonation, and, evaporation, igneous, and, sedimentary, rocks, can, then, be, turned, into, metamorphic, rocks, by, heat, and, pressure, that, change, its, mineral, content, resulting, in, a, characteristic, fabric, all, three, types, may, melt, again, and, when, this, happens, new, magma, is, formed, from, which, an, igneous, rock, may, once, again, solidify, organic, matter, such, as, coal, bitumen, oil, and, natural, gas, is, linked, mainly, to, organic, rich, sedimentary, rocks, to, study, all, three, types, of, rock, geologists, evaluate, the, minerals, of, which, they, are, composed, and, their, other, physical, properties, such, as, texture, and, fabric, geologists, also, study, unlithified, materials, referred, to, as, superficial, deposits, that, lie, above, the, bedrock, this, study, is, often, known, as, quaternary, geology, after, the, quaternary, period, of, geologic, history, which, is, the, most, recent, period, of, geologic, time, magma, is, the, original, unlithified, source, of, all, igneous, rocks, the, active, flow, of, molten, rock, is, closely, studied, in, volcanology, and, igneous, petrology, aims, to, determine, the, history, of, igneous, rocks, from, their, original, molten, source, to, their, final, crystallization, in, the, 1960s, it, was, discovered, that, the, earth, s, lithosphere, which, includes, the, crust, and, rigid, uppermost, portion, of, the, upper, mantle, is, separated, into, tectonic, plates, that, move, across, the, plastically, deforming, solid, upper, mantle, which, is, called, the, asthenosphere, this, theory, is, supported, by, several, types, of, observations, including, seafloor, spreading, and, the, global, distribution, of, mountain, terrain, and, seismicity, there, is, an, intimate, coupling, between, the, movement, of, the, plates, on, the, surface, and, the, convection, of, the, mantle, that, is, the, heat, transfer, caused, by, the, slow, movement, of, ductile, mantle, rock, thus, oceanic, parts, of, plates, and, the, adjoining, mantle, convection, currents, always, move, in, the, same, direction, because, the, oceanic, lithosphere, is, actually, the, rigid, upper, thermal, boundary, layer, of, the, convecting, mantle, this, coupling, between, rigid, plates, moving, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, the, convecting, mantle, is, called, plate, tectonics, the, development, of, plate, tectonics, has, provided, a, physical, basis, for, many, observations, of, the, solid, earth, long, linear, regions, of, geological, features, are, explained, as, plate, boundaries, plate, tectonics, has, provided, a, mechanism, for, alfred, wegener, s, theory, of, continental, drift, in, which, the, continents, move, across, the, surface, of, the, earth, over, geological, time, they, also, provided, a, driving, force, for, crustal, deformation, and, a, new, setting, for, the, observations, of, structural, geology, the, power, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, lies, in, its, ability, to, combine, all, of, these, observations, into, a, single, theory, of, how, the, lithosphere, moves, over, the, convecting, mantle, advances, in, seismology, computer, modeling, and, mineralogy, and, crystallography, at, high, temperatures, and, pressures, give, insights, into, the, internal, composition, and, structure, of, the, earth, seismologists, can, use, the, arrival, times, of, seismic, waves, to, image, the, interior, of, the, earth, early, advances, in, this, field, showed, the, existence, of, a, liquid, outer, core, where, shear, waves, were, not, able, to, propagate, and, a, dense, solid, inner, core, these, advances, led, to, the, development, of, a, layered, model, of, the, earth, with, a, lithosphere, including, crust, on, top, the, mantle, below, separated, within, itself, by, seismic, discontinuities, at, 410, and, 660, kilometers, and, the, outer, core, and, inner, core, below, that, more, recently, seismologists, have, been, able, to, create, detailed, images, of, wave, speeds, inside, the, earth, in, the, same, way, a, doctor, images, a, body, in, a, ct, scan, these, images, have, led, to, a, much, more, detailed, view, of, the, interior, of, the, earth, and, have, replaced, the, simplified, layered, model, with, a, much, more, dynamic, model, mineralogists, have, been, able, to, use, the, pressure, and, temperature, data, from, the, seismic, and, modeling, studies, alongside, knowledge, of, the, elemental, composition, of, the, earth, to, reproduce, these, conditions, in, experimental, settings, and, measure, changes, within, the, crystal, structure, these, studies, explain, the, chemical, changes, associated, with, the, major, seismic, discontinuities, in, the, mantle, and, show, the, crystallographic, structures, expected, in, the, inner, core, of, the, earth, the, geological, time, scale, encompasses, the, history, of, the, earth, it, is, bracketed, at, the, earliest, by, the, dates, of, the, first, solar, system, material, at, 4, 567, ga, or, 4, 567, billion, years, ago, and, the, formation, of, the, earth, at, 4, 54, ga, 4, 54, billion, years, which, is, the, beginning, of, the, hadean, eon, a, division, of, geological, time, at, the, later, end, of, the, scale, it, is, marked, by, the, present, day, in, the, holocene, epoch, the, following, five, timelines, show, the, geologic, time, scale, to, scale, the, first, shows, the, entire, time, from, the, formation, of, the, earth, to, the, present, but, this, gives, little, space, for, the, most, recent, eon, the, second, timeline, shows, an, expanded, view, of, the, most, recent, eon, in, a, similar, way, the, most, recent, era, is, expanded, in, the, third, timeline, the, most, recent, period, is, expanded, in, the, fourth, timeline, and, the, most, recent, epoch, is, expanded, in, the, fifth, timeline, horizontal, scale, is, millions, of, years, above, timelines, thousands, of, years, below, timeline, epochs, methods, for, relative, dating, were, developed, when, geology, first, emerged, as, a, natural, science, geologists, still, use, the, following, principles, today, as, a, means, to, provide, information, about, geological, history, and, the, timing, of, geological, events, the, principle, of, uniformitarianism, states, that, the, geological, processes, observed, in, operation, that, modify, the, earth, s, crust, at, present, have, worked, in, much, the, same, way, over, geological, time, a, fundamental, principle, of, geology, advanced, by, the, 18th, century, scottish, physician, and, geologist, james, hutton, is, that, the, present, is, the, key, to, the, past, in, hutton, s, words, the, past, history, of, our, globe, must, be, explained, by, what, can, be, seen, to, be, happening, now, the, principle, of, intrusive, relationships, concerns, crosscutting, intrusions, in, geology, when, an, igneous, intrusion, cuts, across, a, formation, of, sedimentary, rock, it, can, be, determined, that, the, igneous, intrusion, is, younger, than, the, sedimentary, rock, different, types, of, intrusions, include, stocks, laccoliths, batholiths, sills, and, dikes, the, principle, of, cross, cutting, relationships, pertains, to, the, formation, of, faults, and, the, age, of, the, sequences, through, which, they, cut, faults, are, younger, than, the, rocks, they, cut, accordingly, if, a, fault, is, found, that, penetrates, some, formations, but, not, those, on, top, of, it, then, the, formations, that, were, cut, are, older, than, the, fault, and, the, ones, that, are, not, cut, must, be, younger, than, the, fault, finding, the, key, bed, in, these, situations, may, help, determine, whether, the, fault, is, a, normal, fault, or, a, thrust, fault, the, principle, of, inclusions, and, components, states, that, with, sedimentary, rocks, if, inclusions, or, clasts, are, found, in, a, formation, then, the, inclusions, must, be, older, than, the, formation, that, contains, them, for, example, in, sedimentary, rocks, it, is, common, for, gravel, from, an, older, formation, to, be, ripped, up, and, included, in, a, newer, layer, a, similar, situation, with, igneous, rocks, occurs, when, xenoliths, are, found, these, foreign, bodies, are, picked, up, as, magma, or, lava, flows, and, are, incorporated, later, to, cool, in, the, matrix, as, a, result, xenoliths, are, older, than, the, rock, that, contains, them, the, principle, of, original, horizontality, states, that, the, deposition, of, sediments, occurs, as, essentially, horizontal, beds, observation, of, modern, marine, and, non, marine, sediments, in, a, wide, variety, of, environments, supports, this, generalization, although, cross, bedding, is, inclined, the, overall, orientation, of, cross, bedded, units, is, horizontal, the, principle, of, superposition, states, that, a, sedimentary, rock, layer, in, a, tectonically, undisturbed, sequence, is, younger, than, the, one, beneath, it, and, older, than, the, one, above, it, logically, a, younger, layer, cannot, slip, beneath, a, layer, previously, deposited, this, principle, allows, sedimentary, layers, to, be, viewed, as, a, form, of, the, vertical, timeline, a, partial, or, complete, record, of, the, time, elapsed, from, deposition, of, the, lowest, layer, to, deposition, of, the, highest, bed, the, principle, of, faunal, succession, is, based, on, the, appearance, of, fossils, in, sedimentary, rocks, as, organisms, exist, during, the, same, period, throughout, the, world, their, presence, or, sometimes, absence, provides, a, relative, age, of, the, formations, where, they, appear, based, on, principles, that, william, smith, laid, out, almost, a, hundred, years, before, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, the, principles, of, succession, developed, independently, of, evolutionary, thought, the, principle, becomes, quite, complex, however, given, the, uncertainties, of, fossilization, localization, of, fossil, types, due, to, lateral, changes, in, habitat, facies, change, in, sedimentary, strata, and, that, not, all, fossils, formed, globally, at, the, same, time, geologists, also, use, methods, to, determine, the, absolute, age, of, rock, samples, and, geological, events, these, dates, are, useful, on, their, own, and, may, also, be, used, in, conjunction, with, relative, dating, methods, or, to, calibrate, relative, methods, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, advancement, in, geological, science, was, facilitated, by, the, ability, to, obtain, accurate, absolute, dates, to, geological, events, using, radioactive, isotopes, and, other, methods, this, changed, the, understanding, of, geological, time, previously, geologists, could, only, use, fossils, and, stratigraphic, correlation, to, date, sections, of, rock, relative, to, one, another, with, isotopic, dates, it, became, possible, to, assign, absolute, ages, to, rock, units, and, these, absolute, dates, could, be, applied, to, fossil, sequences, in, which, there, was, datable, material, converting, the, old, relative, ages, into, new, absolute, ages, for, many, geological, applications, isotope, ratios, of, radioactive, elements, are, measured, in, minerals, that, give, the, amount, of, time, that, has, passed, since, a, rock, passed, through, its, particular, closure, temperature, the, point, at, which, different, radiometric, isotopes, stop, diffusing, into, and, out, of, the, crystal, lattice, these, are, used, in, geochronologic, and, thermochronologic, studies, common, methods, include, uranium, lead, dating, potassium, argon, dating, argon, argon, dating, and, uranium, thorium, dating, these, methods, are, used, for, a, variety, of, applications, dating, of, lava, and, volcanic, ash, layers, found, within, a, stratigraphic, sequence, can, provide, absolute, age, data, for, sedimentary, rock, units, that, do, not, contain, radioactive, isotopes, and, calibrate, relative, dating, techniques, these, methods, can, also, be, used, to, determine, ages, of, pluton, emplacement, thermochemical, techniques, can, be, used, to, determine, temperature, profiles, within, the, crust, the, uplift, of, mountain, ranges, and, paleo, topography, fractionation, of, the, lanthanide, series, elements, is, used, to, compute, ages, since, rocks, were, removed, from, the, mantle, other, methods, are, used, for, more, recent, events, optically, stimulated, luminescence, and, cosmogenic, radionuclide, dating, are, used, to, date, surfaces, and, or, erosion, rates, dendrochronology, can, also, be, used, for, the, dating, of, landscapes, radiocarbon, dating, is, used, for, geologically, young, materials, containing, organic, carbon, the, geology, of, an, area, changes, through, time, as, rock, units, are, deposited, and, inserted, and, deformational, processes, alter, their, shapes, and, locations, rock, units, are, first, emplaced, either, by, deposition, onto, the, surface, or, intrusion, into, the, overlying, rock, deposition, can, occur, when, sediments, settle, onto, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, later, lithify, into, sedimentary, rock, or, when, as, volcanic, material, such, as, volcanic, ash, or, lava, flows, blanket, the, surface, igneous, intrusions, such, as, batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and, sills, push, upwards, into, the, overlying, rock, and, crystallize, as, they, intrude, after, the, initial, sequence, of, rocks, has, been, deposited, the, rock, units, can, be, deformed, and, or, metamorphosed, deformation, typically, occurs, as, a, result, of, horizontal, shortening, horizontal, extension, or, side, to, side, strike, slip, motion, these, structural, regimes, broadly, relate, to, convergent, boundaries, divergent, boundaries, and, transform, boundaries, respectively, between, tectonic, plates, when, rock, units, are, placed, under, horizontal, compression, they, shorten, and, become, thicker, because, rock, units, other, than, muds, do, not, significantly, change, in, volume, this, is, accomplished, in, two, primary, ways, through, faulting, and, folding, in, the, shallow, crust, where, brittle, deformation, can, occur, thrust, faults, form, which, causes, the, deeper, rock, to, move, on, top, of, the, shallower, rock, because, deeper, rock, is, often, older, as, noted, by, the, principle, of, superposition, this, can, result, in, older, rocks, moving, on, top, of, younger, ones, movement, along, faults, can, result, in, folding, either, because, the, faults, are, not, planar, or, because, rock, layers, are, dragged, along, forming, drag, folds, as, slip, occurs, along, the, fault, deeper, in, the, earth, rocks, behave, plastically, and, fold, instead, of, faulting, these, folds, can, either, be, those, where, the, material, in, the, center, of, the, fold, buckles, upwards, creating, antiforms, or, where, it, buckles, downwards, creating, synforms, if, the, tops, of, the, rock, units, within, the, folds, remain, pointing, upwards, they, are, called, anticlines, and, synclines, respectively, if, some, of, the, units, in, the, fold, are, facing, downward, the, structure, is, called, an, overturned, anticline, or, syncline, and, if, all, of, the, rock, units, are, overturned, or, the, correct, up, direction, is, unknown, they, are, simply, called, by, the, most, general, terms, antiforms, and, synforms, even, higher, pressures, and, temperatures, during, horizontal, shortening, can, cause, both, folding, and, metamorphism, of, the, rocks, this, metamorphism, causes, changes, in, the, mineral, composition, of, the, rocks, creates, a, foliation, or, planar, surface, that, is, related, to, mineral, growth, under, stress, this, can, remove, signs, of, the, original, textures, of, the, rocks, such, as, bedding, in, sedimentary, rocks, flow, features, of, lavas, and, crystal, patterns, in, crystalline, rocks, extension, causes, the, rock, units, as, a, whole, to, become, longer, and, thinner, this, is, primarily, accomplished, through, normal, faulting, and, through, the, ductile, stretching, and, thinning, normal, faults, drop, rock, units, that, are, higher, below, those, that, are, lower, this, typically, results, in, younger, units, ending, up, below, older, units, stretching, of, units, can, result, in, their, thinning, in, fact, at, one, location, within, the, maria, fold, and, thrust, belt, the, entire, sedimentary, sequence, of, the, grand, canyon, appears, over, a, length, of, less, than, a, meter, rocks, at, the, depth, to, be, ductilely, stretched, are, often, also, metamorphosed, these, stretched, rocks, can, also, pinch, into, lenses, known, as, boudins, after, the, french, word, for, sausage, because, of, their, visual, similarity, where, rock, units, slide, past, one, another, strike, slip, faults, develop, in, shallow, regions, and, become, shear, zones, at, deeper, depths, where, the, rocks, deform, ductilely, the, addition, of, new, rock, units, both, depositionally, and, intrusively, often, occurs, during, deformation, faulting, and, other, deformational, processes, result, in, the, creation, of, topographic, gradients, causing, material, on, the, rock, unit, that, is, increasing, in, elevation, to, be, eroded, by, hillslopes, and, channels, these, sediments, are, deposited, on, the, rock, unit, that, is, going, down, continual, motion, along, the, fault, maintains, the, topographic, gradient, in, spite, of, the, movement, of, sediment, and, continues, to, create, accommodation, space, for, the, material, to, deposit, deformational, events, are, often, also, associated, with, volcanism, and, igneous, activity, volcanic, ashes, and, lavas, accumulate, on, the, surface, and, igneous, intrusions, enter, from, below, dikes, long, planar, igneous, intrusions, enter, along, cracks, and, therefore, often, form, in, large, numbers, in, areas, that, are, being, actively, deformed, this, can, result, in, the, emplacement, of, dike, swarms, such, as, those, that, are, observable, across, the, canadian, shield, or, rings, of, dikes, around, the, lava, tube, of, a, volcano, all, of, these, processes, do, not, necessarily, occur, in, a, single, environment, and, do, not, necessarily, occur, in, a, single, order, the, hawaiian, islands, for, example, consist, almost, entirely, of, layered, basaltic, lava, flows, the, sedimentary, sequences, of, the, mid, continental, united, states, and, the, grand, canyon, in, the, southwestern, united, states, contain, almost, undeformed, stacks, of, sedimentary, rocks, that, have, remained, in, place, since, cambrian, time, other, areas, are, much, more, geologically, complex, in, the, southwestern, united, states, sedimentary, volcanic, and, intrusive, rocks, have, been, metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and, folded, even, older, rocks, such, as, the, acasta, gneiss, of, the, slave, craton, in, northwestern, canada, the, oldest, known, rock, in, the, world, have, been, metamorphosed, to, the, point, where, their, origin, is, indiscernible, without, laboratory, analysis, in, addition, these, processes, can, occur, in, stages, in, many, places, the, grand, canyon, in, the, southwestern, united, states, being, a, very, visible, example, the, lower, rock, units, were, metamorphosed, and, deformed, and, then, deformation, ended, and, the, upper, undeformed, units, were, deposited, although, any, amount, of, rock, emplacement, and, rock, deformation, can, occur, and, they, can, occur, any, number, of, times, these, concepts, provide, a, guide, to, understanding, the, geological, history, of, an, area, geologists, use, a, number, of, fields, laboratory, and, numerical, modeling, methods, to, decipher, earth, history, and, to, understand, the, processes, that, occur, on, and, inside, the, earth, in, typical, geological, investigations, geologists, use, primary, information, related, to, petrology, the, study, of, rocks, stratigraphy, the, study, of, sedimentary, layers, and, structural, geology, the, study, of, positions, of, rock, units, and, their, deformation, in, many, cases, geologists, also, study, modern, soils, rivers, landscapes, and, glaciers, investigate, past, and, current, life, and, biogeochemical, pathways, and, use, geophysical, methods, to, investigate, the, subsurface, sub, specialities, of, geology, may, distinguish, endogenous, and, exogenous, geology, geological, field, work, varies, depending, on, the, task, at, hand, typical, fieldwork, could, consist, of, in, addition, to, identifying, rocks, in, the, field, lithology, petrologists, identify, rock, samples, in, the, laboratory, two, of, the, primary, methods, for, identifying, rocks, in, the, laboratory, are, through, optical, microscopy, and, by, using, an, electron, microprobe, in, an, optical, mineralogy, analysis, petrologists, analyze, thin, sections, of, rock, samples, using, a, petrographic, microscope, where, the, minerals, can, be, identified, through, their, different, properties, in, plane, polarized, and, cross, polarized, light, including, their, birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and, interference, properties, with, a, conoscopic, lens, in, the, electron, microprobe, individual, locations, are, analyzed, for, their, exact, chemical, compositions, and, variation, in, composition, within, individual, crystals, stable, and, radioactive, isotope, studies, provide, insight, into, the, geochemical, evolution, of, rock, units, petrologists, can, also, use, fluid, inclusion, data, and, perform, high, temperature, and, pressure, physical, experiments, to, understand, the, temperatures, and, pressures, at, which, different, mineral, phases, appear, and, how, they, change, through, igneous, and, metamorphic, processes, this, research, can, be, extrapolated, to, the, field, to, understand, metamorphic, processes, and, the, conditions, of, crystallization, of, igneous, rocks, this, work, can, also, help, to, explain, processes, that, occur, within, the, earth, such, as, subduction, and, magma, chamber, evolution, structural, geologists, use, microscopic, analysis, of, oriented, thin, sections, of, geological, samples, to, observe, the, fabric, within, the, rocks, which, gives, information, about, strain, within, the, crystalline, structure, of, the, rocks, they, also, plot, and, combine, measurements, of, geological, structures, to, better, understand, the, orientations, of, faults, and, folds, to, reconstruct, the, history, of, rock, deformation, in, the, area, in, addition, they, perform, analog, and, numerical, experiments, of, rock, deformation, in, large, and, small, settings, the, analysis, of, structures, is, often, accomplished, by, plotting, the, orientations, of, various, features, onto, stereonets, a, stereonet, is, a, stereographic, projection, of, a, sphere, onto, a, plane, in, which, planes, are, projected, as, lines, and, lines, are, projected, as, points, these, can, be, used, to, find, the, locations, of, fold, axes, relationships, between, faults, and, relationships, between, other, geological, structures, among, the, most, well, known, experiments, in, structural, geology, are, those, involving, orogenic, wedges, which, are, zones, in, which, mountains, are, built, along, convergent, tectonic, plate, boundaries, in, the, analog, versions, of, these, experiments, horizontal, layers, of, sand, are, pulled, along, a, lower, surface, into, a, back, stop, which, results, in, realistic, looking, patterns, of, faulting, and, the, growth, of, a, critically, tapered, all, angles, remain, the, same, orogenic, wedge, numerical, models, work, in, the, same, way, as, these, analog, models, though, they, are, often, more, sophisticated, and, can, include, patterns, of, erosion, and, uplift, in, the, mountain, belt, this, helps, to, show, the, relationship, between, erosion, and, the, shape, of, a, mountain, range, these, studies, can, also, give, useful, information, about, pathways, for, metamorphism, through, pressure, temperature, space, and, time, in, the, laboratory, stratigraphers, analyze, samples, of, stratigraphic, sections, that, can, be, returned, from, the, field, such, as, those, from, drill, cores, stratigraphers, also, analyze, data, from, geophysical, surveys, that, show, the, locations, of, stratigraphic, units, in, the, subsurface, geophysical, data, and, well, logs, can, be, combined, to, produce, a, better, view, of, the, subsurface, and, stratigraphers, often, use, computer, programs, to, do, this, in, three, dimensions, stratigraphers, can, then, use, these, data, to, reconstruct, ancient, processes, occurring, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, interpret, past, environments, and, locate, areas, for, water, coal, and, hydrocarbon, extraction, in, the, laboratory, biostratigraphers, analyze, rock, samples, from, outcrop, and, drill, cores, for, the, fossils, found, in, them, these, fossils, help, scientists, to, date, the, core, and, to, understand, the, depositional, environment, in, which, the, rock, units, formed, geochronologists, precisely, date, rocks, within, the, stratigraphic, section, to, provide, better, absolute, bounds, on, the, timing, and, rates, of, deposition, magnetic, stratigraphers, look, for, signs, of, magnetic, reversals, in, igneous, rock, units, within, the, drill, cores, other, scientists, perform, stable, isotope, studies, on, the, rocks, to, gain, information, about, past, climate, with, the, advent, of, space, exploration, in, the, twentieth, century, geologists, have, begun, to, look, at, other, planetary, bodies, in, the, same, ways, that, have, been, developed, to, study, the, earth, this, new, field, of, study, is, called, planetary, geology, sometimes, known, as, astrogeology, and, relies, on, known, geological, principles, to, study, other, bodies, of, the, solar, system, this, is, a, major, aspect, of, planetary, science, and, largely, focuses, on, the, terrestrial, planets, icy, moons, asteroids, comets, and, meteorites, however, some, planetary, geophysicists, study, the, giant, planets, and, exoplanets, although, the, greek, language, origin, prefix, geo, refers, to, earth, geology, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, the, names, of, other, planetary, bodies, when, describing, their, composition, and, internal, processes, examples, are, the, geology, of, mars, and, lunar, geology, specialized, terms, such, as, selenology, studies, of, the, moon, areology, of, mars, etc, are, also, in, use, although, planetary, geologists, are, interested, in, studying, all, aspects, of, other, planets, a, significant, focus, is, to, search, for, evidence, of, past, or, present, life, on, other, worlds, this, has, led, to, many, missions, whose, primary, or, ancillary, purpose, is, to, examine, planetary, bodies, for, evidence, of, life, one, of, these, is, the, phoenix, lander, which, analyzed, martian, polar, soil, for, water, chemical, and, mineralogical, constituents, related, to, biological, processes, economic, geology, is, a, branch, of, geology, that, deals, with, aspects, of, economic, minerals, that, humankind, uses, to, fulfill, various, needs, economic, minerals, are, those, extracted, profitably, for, various, practical, uses, economic, geologists, help, locate, and, manage, the, earth, s, natural, resources, such, as, petroleum, and, coal, as, well, as, mineral, resources, which, include, metals, such, as, iron, copper, and, uranium, mining, geology, consists, of, the, extractions, of, mineral, and, ore, resources, from, the, earth, some, resources, of, economic, interests, include, gemstones, metals, such, as, gold, and, copper, and, many, minerals, such, as, asbestos, magnesite, perlite, mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and, silica, as, well, as, elements, such, as, sulfur, chlorine, and, helium, petroleum, geologists, study, the, locations, of, the, subsurface, of, the, earth, that, can, contain, extractable, hydrocarbons, especially, petroleum, and, natural, gas, because, many, of, these, reservoirs, are, found, in, sedimentary, basins, they, study, the, formation, of, these, basins, as, well, as, their, sedimentary, and, tectonic, evolution, and, the, present, day, positions, of, the, rock, units, engineering, geology, is, the, application, of, geological, principles, to, engineering, practice, for, the, purpose, of, assuring, that, the, geological, factors, affecting, the, location, design, construction, operation, and, maintenance, of, engineering, works, are, properly, addressed, engineering, geology, is, distinct, from, geological, engineering, particularly, in, north, america, in, the, field, of, civil, engineering, geological, principles, and, analyses, are, used, in, order, to, ascertain, the, mechanical, principles, of, the, material, on, which, structures, are, built, this, allows, tunnels, to, be, built, without, collapsing, bridges, and, skyscrapers, to, be, built, with, sturdy, foundations, and, buildings, to, be, built, that, will, not, settle, in, clay, and, mud, geology, and, geological, principles, can, be, applied, to, various, environmental, problems, such, as, stream, restoration, the, restoration, of, brownfields, and, the, understanding, of, the, interaction, between, natural, habitat, and, the, geological, environment, groundwater, hydrology, or, hydrogeology, is, used, to, locate, groundwater, which, can, often, provide, a, ready, supply, of, uncontaminated, water, and, is, especially, important, in, arid, regions, and, to, monitor, the, spread, of, contaminants, in, groundwater, wells, geologists, also, obtain, data, through, stratigraphy, boreholes, core, samples, and, ice, cores, ice, cores, and, sediment, cores, are, used, for, paleoclimate, reconstructions, which, tell, geologists, about, past, and, present, temperature, precipitation, and, sea, level, across, the, globe, these, datasets, are, our, primary, source, of, information, on, global, climate, change, outside, of, instrumental, data, geologists, and, geophysicists, study, natural, hazards, in, order, to, enact, safe, building, codes, and, warning, systems, that, are, used, to, prevent, loss, of, property, and, life, examples, of, important, natural, hazards, that, are, pertinent, to, geology, as, opposed, those, that, are, mainly, or, only, pertinent, to, meteorology, are, the, study, of, the, physical, material, of, the, earth, dates, back, at, least, to, ancient, greece, when, theophrastus, 372, 287, bce, wrote, the, work, peri, lithon, on, stones, during, the, roman, period, pliny, the, elder, wrote, in, detail, of, the, many, minerals, and, metals, then, in, practical, use, even, correctly, noting, the, origin, of, amber, additionally, in, the, 4th, century, bce, aristotle, made, critical, observations, of, the, slow, rate, of, geological, change, he, observed, the, composition, of, the, land, and, formulated, a, theory, where, the, earth, changes, at, a, slow, rate, and, that, these, changes, cannot, be, observed, during, one, person, s, lifetime, aristotle, developed, one, of, the, first, evidence, based, concepts, connected, to, the, geological, realm, regarding, the, rate, at, which, the, earth, physically, changes, abu, al, rayhan, al, biruni, 973, 1048, ce, was, one, of, the, earliest, persian, geologists, whose, works, included, the, earliest, writings, on, the, geology, of, india, hypothesizing, that, the, indian, subcontinent, was, once, a, sea, drawing, from, greek, and, indian, scientific, literature, that, were, not, destroyed, by, the, muslim, conquests, the, persian, scholar, ibn, sina, avicenna, 981, 1037, proposed, detailed, explanations, for, the, formation, of, mountains, the, origin, of, earthquakes, and, other, topics, central, to, modern, geology, which, provided, an, essential, foundation, for, the, later, development, of, the, science, in, china, the, polymath, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, formulated, a, hypothesis, for, the, process, of, land, formation, based, on, his, observation, of, fossil, animal, shells, in, a, geological, stratum, in, a, mountain, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, ocean, he, inferred, that, the, land, was, formed, by, the, erosion, of, the, mountains, and, by, deposition, of, silt, georgius, agricola, 1494, 1555, published, his, groundbreaking, work, de, natura, fossilium, in, 1546, and, is, seen, as, the, founder, of, geology, as, a, scientific, discipline, nicolas, steno, 1638, 1686, is, credited, with, the, law, of, superposition, the, principle, of, original, horizontality, and, the, principle, of, lateral, continuity, three, defining, principles, of, stratigraphy, the, word, geology, was, first, used, by, ulisse, aldrovandi, in, 1603, then, by, jean, andr, deluc, in, 1778, and, introduced, as, a, fixed, term, by, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, in, 1779, the, word, is, derived, from, the, greek, g, meaning, earth, and, logos, meaning, speech, but, according, to, another, source, the, word, geology, comes, from, a, norwegian, mikkel, peders, n, escholt, 1600, 1669, who, was, a, priest, and, scholar, escholt, first, used, the, definition, in, his, book, titled, geologia, norvegica, 1657, william, smith, 1769, 1839, drew, some, of, the, first, geological, maps, and, began, the, process, of, ordering, rock, strata, layers, by, examining, the, fossils, contained, in, them, in, 1763, mikhail, lomonosov, published, his, treatise, on, the, strata, of, earth, his, work, was, the, first, narrative, of, modern, geology, based, on, the, unity, of, processes, in, time, and, explanation, of, the, earth, s, past, from, the, present, james, hutton, 1726, 1797, is, often, viewed, as, the, first, modern, geologist, in, 1785, he, presented, a, paper, entitled, theory, of, the, earth, to, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, his, paper, he, explained, his, theory, that, the, earth, must, be, much, older, than, had, previously, been, supposed, to, allow, enough, time, for, mountains, to, be, eroded, and, for, sediments, to, form, new, rocks, at, the, bottom, of, the, sea, which, in, turn, were, raised, up, to, become, dry, land, hutton, published, a, two, volume, version, of, his, ideas, in, 1795, followers, of, hutton, were, known, as, plutonists, because, they, believed, that, some, rocks, were, formed, by, vulcanism, which, is, the, deposition, of, lava, from, volcanoes, as, opposed, to, the, neptunists, led, by, abraham, werner, who, believed, that, all, rocks, had, settled, out, of, a, large, ocean, whose, level, gradually, dropped, over, time, the, first, geological, map, of, the, u, s, was, produced, in, 1809, by, william, maclure, in, 1807, maclure, commenced, the, self, imposed, task, of, making, a, geological, survey, of, the, united, states, almost, every, state, in, the, union, was, traversed, and, mapped, by, him, the, allegheny, mountains, being, crossed, and, recrossed, some, 50, times, the, results, of, his, unaided, labours, were, submitted, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, a, memoir, entitled, observations, on, the, geology, of, the, united, states, explanatory, of, a, geological, map, and, published, in, the, society, s, transactions, together, with, the, nation, s, first, geological, map, this, antedates, william, smith, s, geological, map, of, england, by, six, years, although, it, was, constructed, using, a, different, classification, of, rocks, sir, charles, lyell, 1797, 1875, first, published, his, famous, book, principles, of, geology, in, 1830, this, book, which, influenced, the, thought, of, charles, darwin, successfully, promoted, the, doctrine, of, uniformitarianism, this, theory, states, that, slow, geological, processes, have, occurred, throughout, the, earth, s, history, and, are, still, occurring, today, in, contrast, catastrophism, is, the, theory, that, earth, s, features, formed, in, single, catastrophic, events, and, remained, unchanged, thereafter, though, hutton, believed, in, uniformitarianism, the, idea, was, not, widely, accepted, at, the, time, much, of, 19th, century, geology, revolved, around, the, question, of, the, earth, s, exact, age, estimates, varied, from, a, few, hundred, thousand, to, billions, of, years, by, the, early, 20th, century, radiometric, dating, allowed, the, earth, s, age, to, be, estimated, at, two, billion, years, the, awareness, of, this, vast, amount, of, time, opened, the, door, to, new, theories, about, the, processes, that, shaped, the, planet, some, of, the, most, significant, advances, in, 20th, century, geology, have, been, the, development, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, in, the, 1960s, and, the, refinement, of, estimates, of, the, planet, s, age, plate, tectonics, theory, arose, from, two, separate, geological, observations, seafloor, spreading, and, continental, drift, the, theory, revolutionized, the, earth, sciences, today, the, earth, is, known, to, be, approximately, 4, 5, billion, years, old
