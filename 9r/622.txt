https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent
a, continent, is, any, of, several, large, geographical, regions, continents, are, generally, identified, by, convention, rather, than, any, strict, criteria, a, continent, could, be, a, single, landmass, or, a, part, of, a, very, large, landmass, as, in, the, case, of, asia, or, europe, due, to, this, the, number, of, continents, varies, up, to, seven, or, as, few, as, four, geographical, regions, are, commonly, regarded, as, continents, most, english, speaking, countries, recognize, seven, regions, as, continents, in, order, from, largest, to, smallest, in, area, these, seven, regions, are, asia, africa, north, america, south, america, antarctica, europe, and, australia, different, variations, with, fewer, continents, merge, some, of, these, regions, examples, of, this, are, merging, north, america, and, south, america, into, america, asia, and, europe, into, eurasia, and, africa, asia, and, europe, into, afro, eurasia, oceanic, islands, are, occasionally, grouped, with, a, nearby, continent, to, divide, all, the, world, s, land, into, geographical, regions, under, this, scheme, most, of, the, island, countries, and, territories, in, the, pacific, ocean, are, grouped, together, with, the, continent, of, australia, to, form, the, geographical, region, oceania, in, geology, a, continent, is, defined, as, one, of, earth, s, major, landmasses, including, both, dry, land, and, continental, shelves, the, geological, continents, correspond, to, seven, large, areas, of, continental, crust, that, are, found, on, the, tectonic, plates, but, exclude, small, continental, fragments, such, as, madagascar, that, are, generally, referred, to, as, microcontinents, continental, crust, is, only, known, to, exist, on, earth, the, idea, of, continental, drift, gained, recognition, in, the, 20th, century, it, postulates, that, the, current, continents, formed, from, the, breaking, up, of, a, supercontinent, pangaea, that, formed, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, ago, from, the, 16th, century, the, english, noun, continent, was, derived, from, the, term, continent, land, meaning, continuous, or, connected, land, and, translated, from, the, latin, terra, continens, the, noun, was, used, to, mean, a, connected, or, continuous, tract, of, land, or, mainland, it, was, not, applied, only, to, very, large, areas, of, land, in, the, 17th, century, references, were, made, to, the, continents, or, mainlands, of, the, isle, of, man, ireland, and, wales, and, in, 1745, to, sumatra, the, word, continent, was, used, in, translating, greek, and, latin, writings, about, the, three, parts, of, the, world, although, in, the, original, languages, no, word, of, exactly, the, same, meaning, as, continent, was, used, while, continent, was, used, on, the, one, hand, for, relatively, small, areas, of, continuous, land, on, the, other, hand, geographers, again, raised, herodotus, s, query, about, why, a, single, large, landmass, should, be, divided, into, separate, continents, in, the, mid, 17th, century, peter, heylin, wrote, in, his, cosmographie, that, a, continent, is, a, great, quantity, of, land, not, separated, by, any, sea, from, the, rest, of, the, world, as, the, whole, continent, of, europe, asia, africa, in, 1727, ephraim, chambers, wrote, in, his, cyclop, dia, the, world, is, ordinarily, divided, into, two, grand, continents, the, old, and, the, new, and, in, his, 1752, atlas, emanuel, bowen, defined, a, continent, as, a, large, space, of, dry, land, comprehending, many, countries, all, joined, together, without, any, separation, by, water, thus, europe, asia, and, africa, is, one, great, continent, as, america, is, another, however, the, old, idea, of, europe, asia, and, africa, as, parts, of, the, world, ultimately, persisted, with, these, being, regarded, as, separate, continents, by, convention, continents, are, understood, to, be, large, continuous, discrete, masses, of, land, ideally, separated, by, expanses, of, water, in, modern, schemes, with, five, or, more, recognized, continents, at, least, one, pair, of, continents, is, joined, by, land, in, some, fashion, the, criterion, large, leads, to, arbitrary, classification, greenland, with, a, surface, area, of, 2, 166, 086, square, kilometres, 836, 330, sq, mi, is, only, considered, the, world, s, largest, island, while, australia, at, 7, 617, 930, square, kilometres, 2, 941, 300, sq, mi, is, deemed, the, smallest, continent, earth, s, major, landmasses, all, have, coasts, on, a, single, continuous, world, ocean, which, is, divided, into, several, principal, oceanic, components, by, the, continents, and, various, geographic, criteria, the, most, restricted, meaning, of, continent, is, that, of, a, continuous, area, of, land, or, mainland, with, the, coastline, and, any, land, boundaries, forming, the, edge, of, the, continent, in, this, sense, the, term, continental, europe, sometimes, referred, to, in, britain, as, the, continent, is, used, to, refer, to, mainland, europe, excluding, islands, such, as, great, britain, iceland, ireland, and, malta, while, the, term, continent, of, australia, may, refer, to, the, mainland, of, australia, excluding, new, guinea, tasmania, and, other, nearby, islands, similarly, the, continental, united, states, refers, to, the, 49, states, including, alaska, but, excluding, hawaii, located, on, the, continent, of, north, america, and, the, district, of, columbia, from, the, perspective, of, geology, or, physical, geography, continent, may, be, extended, beyond, the, confines, of, continuous, dry, land, to, include, the, shallow, submerged, adjacent, area, the, continental, shelf, and, the, islands, on, the, shelf, continental, islands, as, they, are, structurally, part, of, the, continent, from, this, perspective, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, is, the, true, edge, of, the, continent, as, shorelines, vary, with, changes, in, sea, level, in, this, sense, the, islands, of, great, britain, and, ireland, are, part, of, europe, while, australia, and, the, island, of, new, guinea, together, form, a, continent, as, a, cultural, construct, the, concept, of, a, continent, may, go, beyond, the, continental, shelf, to, include, oceanic, islands, and, continental, fragments, in, this, way, iceland, is, considered, a, part, of, europe, and, madagascar, a, part, of, africa, extrapolating, the, concept, to, its, extreme, some, geographers, group, the, australian, continental, landmass, with, other, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, into, oceania, which, is, usually, considered, a, region, rather, than, a, continent, this, divides, the, entire, land, surface, of, earth, into, continents, regions, or, quasi, continents, the, criterion, that, each, continent, is, a, discrete, landmass, is, commonly, relaxed, due, to, historical, conventions, and, practical, use, of, the, seven, most, globally, recognized, continents, only, antarctica, and, australia, are, completely, separated, from, other, continents, by, the, ocean, several, continents, are, defined, not, as, absolutely, distinct, bodies, but, as, more, or, less, discrete, masses, of, land, africa, and, asia, are, joined, by, the, isthmus, of, suez, and, north, america, and, south, america, by, the, isthmus, of, panama, in, both, cases, there, is, no, complete, separation, of, these, landmasses, by, water, disregarding, the, suez, canal, and, the, panama, canal, which, are, both, narrow, and, shallow, as, well, as, human, made, both, of, these, isthmuses, are, very, narrow, compared, to, the, bulk, of, the, landmasses, they, unite, north, america, and, south, america, are, treated, as, separate, continents, in, the, seven, continent, model, however, they, may, also, be, viewed, as, a, single, continent, known, as, america, this, viewpoint, was, common, in, the, united, states, until, world, war, ii, and, remains, prevalent, in, some, asian, six, continent, models, the, single, american, continent, model, remains, a, common, view, in, france, greece, hungary, italy, malta, portugal, spain, and, latin, american, countries, the, criterion, of, a, discrete, landmass, is, completely, disregarded, if, the, continuous, landmass, of, eurasia, is, classified, as, two, separate, continents, asia, and, europe, physiographically, europe, and, the, indian, subcontinent, are, large, peninsulas, of, the, eurasian, landmass, however, europe, is, considered, a, continent, with, its, comparatively, large, land, area, of, 10, 180, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 930, 000, sq, mi, while, the, indian, subcontinent, with, less, than, half, that, area, is, considered, a, subcontinent, the, alternative, view, in, geology, and, geography, that, eurasia, is, a, single, continent, results, in, a, six, continent, view, of, the, world, some, view, the, separation, of, eurasia, into, asia, and, europe, as, a, residue, of, eurocentrism, in, physical, cultural, and, historical, diversity, china, and, india, are, comparable, to, the, entire, european, landmass, not, to, a, single, european, country, however, for, historical, and, cultural, reasons, the, view, of, europe, as, a, separate, continent, continues, in, almost, all, categorizations, if, continents, are, defined, strictly, as, discrete, landmasses, embracing, all, the, contiguous, land, of, a, body, then, africa, asia, and, europe, form, a, single, continent, which, may, be, referred, to, as, afro, eurasia, combined, with, the, consolidation, of, the, americas, this, would, produce, a, four, continent, model, consisting, of, afro, eurasia, america, antarctica, and, australia, when, sea, levels, were, lower, during, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, greater, areas, of, the, continental, shelf, were, exposed, as, dry, land, forming, land, bridges, between, tasmania, and, the, australian, mainland, at, those, times, australia, and, new, guinea, were, a, single, continuous, continent, known, as, sahul, likewise, afro, eurasia, and, the, americas, were, joined, by, the, bering, land, bridge, other, islands, such, as, great, britain, were, joined, to, the, mainlands, of, their, continents, at, that, time, there, were, just, three, discrete, landmasses, in, the, world, africa, eurasia, america, antarctica, and, australia, new, guinea, sahul, there, are, several, ways, of, distinguishing, the, continents, in, the, english, speaking, countries, geographers, often, use, the, term, oceania, to, denote, a, geographical, region, which, includes, most, of, the, island, countries, and, territories, in, the, pacific, ocean, as, well, as, the, continent, of, australia, an, eighth, continent, has, been, identified, with, various, places, such, as, zealandia, a, submerged, continent, the, following, table, provides, areas, given, by, encyclop, dia, britannica, for, each, continent, in, accordance, with, the, seven, continent, model, including, australasia, along, with, melanesia, micronesia, and, polynesia, as, parts, of, oceania, it, also, provides, populations, of, continents, according, to, 2021, estimates, by, the, united, nations, statistics, division, based, on, the, united, nations, geoscheme, which, includes, all, of, egypt, including, the, isthmus, of, suez, and, the, sinai, peninsula, as, a, part, of, africa, all, of, armenia, azerbaijan, cyprus, georgia, indonesia, kazakhstan, and, turkey, including, east, thrace, as, parts, of, asia, all, of, russia, including, siberia, as, a, part, of, europe, all, of, panama, and, the, united, states, including, hawaii, as, parts, of, north, america, and, all, of, chile, including, easter, island, as, a, part, of, south, america, apart, from, the, current, continents, the, scope, and, meaning, of, the, term, continent, includes, past, geological, ones, supercontinents, largely, in, evidence, earlier, in, the, geological, record, are, landmasses, that, comprise, most, of, the, world, s, cratons, or, continental, cores, these, have, included, vaalbara, kenorland, columbia, rodinia, pannotia, and, pangaea, over, time, these, supercontinents, broke, apart, into, large, landmasses, which, formed, the, present, continents, certain, parts, of, continents, are, recognized, as, subcontinents, especially, the, large, peninsulas, separated, from, the, main, continental, landmass, by, geographical, features, the, most, widely, recognized, example, is, the, indian, subcontinent, the, arabian, peninsula, southern, africa, the, southern, cone, of, south, america, and, alaska, in, north, america, might, be, considered, further, examples, in, many, of, these, cases, the, subcontinents, concerned, are, on, different, tectonic, plates, from, the, rest, of, the, continent, providing, a, geological, justification, for, the, terminology, greenland, generally, considered, the, world, s, largest, island, on, the, northeastern, periphery, of, the, north, american, plate, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, subcontinent, this, is, a, significant, departure, from, the, more, conventional, view, of, a, subcontinent, as, comprising, a, very, large, peninsula, on, the, fringe, of, a, continent, where, the, americas, are, viewed, as, a, single, continent, america, it, is, divided, into, two, subcontinents, north, america, and, south, america, or, three, central, america, being, the, third, when, eurasia, is, regarded, as, a, single, continent, asia, and, europe, are, treated, as, subcontinents, some, areas, of, continental, crust, are, largely, covered, by, the, ocean, and, may, be, considered, submerged, continents, notable, examples, are, zealandia, emerging, from, the, ocean, primarily, in, new, zealand, and, new, caledonia, and, the, almost, completely, submerged, kerguelen, plateau, in, the, southern, indian, ocean, some, islands, lie, on, sections, of, continental, crust, that, have, rifted, and, drifted, apart, from, a, main, continental, landmass, while, not, considered, continents, because, of, their, relatively, small, size, they, may, be, considered, microcontinents, madagascar, the, largest, example, is, usually, considered, an, island, of, africa, but, its, divergent, evolution, has, caused, it, to, be, referred, to, as, the, eighth, continent, from, a, biological, perspective, geologists, use, four, key, attributes, to, define, a, continent, with, the, addition, of, zealandia, in, 2017, earth, currently, has, seven, recognized, geological, continents, due, to, lacking, the, presence, of, precambrian, cratonic, rocks, zealandia, s, status, as, a, geological, continent, has, been, disputed, by, some, geologists, however, a, study, conducted, in, 2021, found, that, part, of, the, submerged, continent, is, indeed, precambrian, twice, as, old, as, geologists, had, previously, thought, which, is, further, evidence, that, supports, the, idea, of, zealandia, being, a, geological, continent, all, seven, geological, continents, are, spatially, isolated, by, geologic, features, the, term, continent, translates, the, greek, word, meaning, landmass, terra, firma, the, proper, name, of, epirus, and, later, especially, used, for, asia, i, e, asia, minor, the, first, distinction, between, continents, was, made, by, ancient, greek, mariners, who, gave, the, names, europe, and, asia, to, the, lands, on, either, side, of, the, waterways, of, the, aegean, sea, the, dardanelles, strait, the, sea, of, marmara, the, bosporus, strait, and, the, black, sea, the, names, were, first, applied, just, to, lands, near, the, coast, and, only, later, extended, to, include, the, hinterlands, but, the, division, was, only, carried, through, to, the, end, of, navigable, waterways, and, beyond, that, point, the, hellenic, geographers, never, succeeded, in, laying, their, finger, on, any, inland, feature, in, the, physical, landscape, that, could, offer, any, convincing, line, for, partitioning, an, indivisible, eurasia, ancient, greek, thinkers, subsequently, debated, whether, africa, then, called, libya, should, be, considered, part, of, asia, or, a, third, part, of, the, world, division, into, three, parts, eventually, came, to, predominate, from, the, greek, viewpoint, the, aegean, sea, was, the, center, of, the, world, asia, lay, to, the, east, europe, to, the, north, and, west, and, africa, to, the, south, the, boundaries, between, the, continents, were, not, fixed, early, on, the, europe, asia, boundary, was, taken, to, run, from, the, black, sea, along, the, rioni, river, known, then, as, the, phasis, in, georgia, later, it, was, viewed, as, running, from, the, black, sea, through, kerch, strait, the, sea, of, azov, and, along, the, don, river, known, then, as, the, tanais, in, russia, the, boundary, between, asia, and, africa, was, generally, taken, to, be, the, nile, river, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bce, objected, to, the, whole, of, egypt, being, split, between, asia, and, africa, libya, and, took, the, boundary, to, lie, along, the, western, border, of, egypt, regarding, egypt, as, part, of, asia, he, also, questioned, the, division, into, three, of, what, is, really, a, single, landmass, a, debate, that, continues, nearly, two, and, a, half, millennia, later, herodotus, believed, europe, to, be, larger, than, the, other, two, continents, i, wonder, then, at, those, who, have, mapped, out, and, divided, the, world, into, libya, asia, and, europe, for, the, difference, between, them, is, great, seeing, that, in, length, europe, stretches, along, both, the, others, together, and, it, appears, to, me, to, be, wider, beyond, all, comparison, eratosthenes, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, noted, that, some, geographers, divided, the, continents, by, rivers, the, nile, and, the, don, thus, considering, them, islands, others, divided, the, continents, by, isthmuses, calling, the, continents, peninsulas, these, latter, geographers, set, the, border, between, europe, and, asia, at, the, isthmus, between, the, black, sea, and, the, caspian, sea, and, the, border, between, asia, and, africa, at, the, isthmus, between, the, red, sea, and, the, mouth, of, lake, bardawil, on, the, mediterranean, sea, the, roman, author, pliny, the, elder, writing, in, the, 1st, century, ce, stated, that, the, whole, globe, is, divided, into, three, parts, europe, asia, and, africa, adding, i, shall, first, then, speak, of, europe, the, foster, mother, of, that, people, which, has, conquered, all, other, nations, and, itself, by, far, the, most, beauteous, portion, of, the, earth, indeed, many, persons, have, not, without, reason, considered, it, not, as, a, third, part, only, of, the, earth, but, as, equal, to, all, the, rest, looking, upon, the, whole, of, our, globe, as, divided, into, two, parts, only, by, a, line, drawn, from, the, river, tanais, to, the, straits, of, gades, following, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, culture, that, developed, in, its, place, linked, to, latin, and, the, catholic, church, began, to, associate, itself, with, the, concept, of, europe, through, the, roman, period, and, the, middle, ages, a, few, writers, took, the, isthmus, of, suez, as, the, boundary, between, asia, and, africa, but, most, writers, continued, to, consider, it, the, nile, or, the, western, border, of, egypt, gibbon, in, the, middle, ages, the, world, was, usually, portrayed, on, t, and, o, maps, with, the, t, representing, the, waters, dividing, the, three, continents, by, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, the, fashion, of, dividing, asia, and, africa, at, the, nile, or, at, the, great, catabathmus, farther, west, had, even, then, scarcely, passed, away, christopher, columbus, sailed, across, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, caribbean, in, 1492, sparking, a, period, of, european, exploration, of, the, americas, but, despite, four, voyages, to, the, americas, columbus, never, believed, he, had, reached, a, new, continent, he, always, thought, it, was, part, of, asia, in, 1501, amerigo, vespucci, and, gon, alo, coelho, attempted, to, sail, around, what, they, considered, the, southern, end, of, the, asian, mainland, into, the, indian, ocean, passing, through, fernando, de, noronha, after, reaching, the, coast, of, brazil, they, sailed, along, the, coast, of, south, america, much, farther, south, than, asia, was, known, to, extend, confirming, that, this, was, a, land, of, continental, proportions, on, return, to, europe, an, account, of, the, voyage, called, mundus, novus, new, world, was, published, under, vespucci, s, name, in, 1502, or, 1503, although, it, seems, that, it, had, additions, or, alterations, by, another, writer, regardless, of, who, penned, the, words, mundus, novus, credited, vespucci, with, saying, i, have, discovered, a, continent, in, those, southern, regions, that, is, inhabited, by, more, numerous, people, and, animals, than, our, europe, or, asia, or, africa, the, first, known, explicit, identification, of, part, of, the, americas, as, a, continent, like, the, other, three, within, a, few, years, the, name, new, world, began, appearing, as, a, name, for, south, america, on, world, maps, such, as, the, oliveriana, pesaro, map, of, around, 1504, 1505, maps, of, this, time, though, still, showed, north, america, connected, to, asia, and, showed, south, america, as, a, separate, land, in, 1507, martin, waldseem, ller, published, a, world, map, universalis, cosmographia, which, was, the, first, to, show, north, and, south, america, as, separate, from, asia, and, surrounded, by, water, a, small, inset, map, above, the, main, map, explicitly, showed, for, the, first, time, the, americas, being, east, of, asia, and, separated, from, asia, by, an, ocean, as, opposed, to, just, placing, the, americas, on, the, left, end, of, the, map, and, asia, on, the, right, end, in, the, accompanying, book, cosmographiae, introductio, waldseem, ller, noted, that, the, earth, is, divided, into, four, parts, europe, asia, africa, and, the, fourth, part, which, he, named, america, after, amerigo, vespucci, s, first, name, on, the, map, the, word, america, was, placed, on, part, of, south, america, the, sanskrit, text, rig, veda, often, dated, 1500, bce, has, the, earliest, mention, of, seven, continents, in, the, earth, the, text, claims, that, the, earth, has, seven, continents, and, lord, vishnu, measured, the, entire, universe, from, his, first, foot, from, the, land, of, earth, which, has, 7, continents, ato, dev, avantu, no, yato, vi, urvicakrame, p, thivy, saptadh, mabhi, ida, vi, urvi, cakrame, tredh, ni, dadhe, padam, sam, hamasya, p, sure, tr, i, pad, vi,

this, world, strode, vishnu, thrice, his, foot, he, planted, and, the, whole, was, gathered, in, his, footstep, s, dust, vishnu, the, guardian, he, whom, none, deceiveth, made, three, steps, thenceforth, establishing, his, high, decrees, in, regard, to, the, above, quoted, verses, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, there, are, seven, continents, or, regions, of, the, earth, a, glucklich, adds, that, in, the, matsya, purana, for, instance, there, is, a, seven, part, map, of, the, world, one, centre, where, an, immense, mountain, mount, meru, or, maha, meru, great, meru, stands, the, continents, encircle, the, mountain, in, seven, concentric, circles, it, seems, clear, that, the, himalayas, were, the, approximate, location, of, mt, meru, and, the, text, is, clear, that, the, earth, has, seven, continents, from, the, late, 18th, century, some, geographers, started, to, regard, north, america, and, south, america, as, two, parts, of, the, world, making, five, parts, in, total, overall, though, the, fourfold, division, prevailed, well, into, the, 19th, century, europeans, discovered, australia, in, 1606, but, for, some, time, it, was, taken, as, part, of, asia, by, the, late, 18th, century, some, geographers, considered, it, a, continent, in, its, own, right, making, it, the, sixth, or, fifth, for, those, still, taking, america, as, a, single, continent, in, 1813, samuel, butler, wrote, of, australia, as, new, holland, an, immense, island, which, some, geographers, dignify, with, the, appellation, of, another, continent, and, the, oxford, english, dictionary, was, just, as, equivocal, some, decades, later, it, was, in, the, 1950s, that, the, concept, of, oceania, as, a, great, division, of, the, world, was, replaced, by, the, concept, of, australia, as, a, continent, antarctica, was, sighted, in, 1820, during, the, first, russian, antarctic, expedition, and, described, as, a, continent, by, charles, wilkes, on, the, united, states, exploring, expedition, in, 1838, the, last, continent, identified, although, a, great, antarctic, antipodean, landmass, had, been, anticipated, for, millennia, an, 1849, atlas, labelled, antarctica, as, a, continent, but, few, atlases, did, so, until, after, world, war, ii, over, time, the, western, concept, of, dividing, the, world, into, continents, spread, globally, replacing, conceptions, in, other, areas, of, the, world, the, idea, of, continents, continued, to, become, imbued, with, cultural, and, political, meaning, in, the, 19th, century, during, the, meiji, period, japanese, leaders, began, to, self, identify, with, the, concept, of, being, asian, and, renew, relations, with, other, asian, countries, while, conceiving, of, the, idea, of, asian, solidarity, against, western, countries, this, conception, of, an, asian, identity, as, well, as, the, idea, of, asian, solidarity, was, later, taken, up, by, others, in, the, region, such, as, republican, china, and, vietnam, from, the, mid, 19th, century, atlases, published, in, the, united, states, more, commonly, treated, north, and, south, america, as, separate, continents, while, atlases, published, in, europe, usually, considered, them, one, continent, however, it, was, still, not, uncommon, for, american, atlases, to, treat, them, as, one, continent, up, until, world, war, ii, from, the, 1950s, most, u, s, geographers, divided, the, americas, into, two, continents, with, the, addition, of, antarctica, this, made, the, seven, continent, model, however, this, division, of, the, americas, never, appealed, to, latin, americans, who, saw, their, region, spanning, an, am, rica, as, a, single, landmass, and, there, the, conception, of, six, continents, remains, dominant, as, it, does, in, scattered, other, countries, some, geographers, regard, europe, and, asia, together, as, a, single, continent, dubbed, eurasia, in, this, model, the, world, is, divided, into, six, continents, with, north, america, and, south, america, considered, separate, continents, geologists, use, the, term, continent, in, a, different, manner, from, geographers, in, geology, a, continent, is, defined, by, continental, crust, which, is, a, platform, of, metamorphic, and, igneous, rock, largely, of, granitic, composition, continental, crust, is, less, dense, and, much, thicker, than, oceanic, crust, which, causes, it, to, float, higher, than, oceanic, crust, on, the, dense, underlying, mantle, this, explains, why, the, continents, form, high, platforms, surrounded, by, deep, ocean, basins, some, geologists, restrict, the, term, continent, to, portions, of, the, crust, built, around, stable, regions, called, cratons, cratons, have, largely, been, unaffected, by, mountain, building, events, orogenies, since, the, precambrian, a, craton, typically, consists, of, a, continental, shield, surrounded, by, a, continental, platform, the, shield, is, a, region, where, ancient, crystalline, basement, rock, typically, 1, 5, to, 3, 8, billion, years, old, is, widely, exposed, at, the, surface, the, platform, surrounding, the, shield, is, also, composed, of, ancient, basement, rock, but, with, a, cover, of, younger, sedimentary, rock, the, continents, are, accretionary, crustal, rafts, that, unlike, the, denser, basaltic, crust, of, the, ocean, basins, are, not, subjected, to, destruction, through, the, plate, tectonic, process, of, subduction, this, accounts, for, the, great, age, of, the, rocks, comprising, the, continental, cratons, the, margins, of, geologic, continents, are, either, active, or, passive, an, active, margin, is, characterised, by, mountain, building, either, through, a, continent, on, continent, collision, or, a, subduction, zone, continents, grow, by, accreting, lighter, volcanic, island, chains, and, microcontinents, along, these, active, margins, forming, orogens, at, a, passive, margin, the, continental, crust, is, stretched, thin, by, extension, to, form, a, continental, shelf, which, tapers, off, with, a, gradual, slope, covered, in, sediment, connecting, it, directly, to, the, oceanic, crust, beyond, most, passive, margins, eventually, transition, into, active, margins, where, the, oceanic, plate, becomes, too, heavy, due, to, cooling, it, disconnects, from, the, continental, crust, and, starts, subducting, below, it, forming, a, new, subduction, zone, there, are, many, microcontinents, or, continental, fragments, that, are, built, of, continental, crust, but, do, not, contain, a, craton, some, of, these, are, fragments, of, gondwana, or, other, ancient, cratonic, continents, zealandia, which, includes, new, zealand, and, new, caledonia, madagascar, the, northern, mascarene, plateau, which, includes, the, seychelles, other, islands, such, as, several, in, the, caribbean, sea, are, composed, largely, of, granitic, rock, as, well, but, all, continents, contain, both, granitic, and, basaltic, crust, and, there, is, no, clear, boundary, as, to, which, islands, would, be, considered, microcontinents, under, such, a, definition, the, kerguelen, plateau, for, example, is, largely, volcanic, but, is, associated, with, the, breakup, of, gondwanaland, and, is, considered, a, microcontinent, whereas, volcanic, iceland, and, hawaii, are, not, the, british, isles, sri, lanka, borneo, and, newfoundland, were, on, the, margins, of, the, laurasian, continent, only, separated, from, the, main, continental, landmass, by, inland, seas, flooding, its, margins, the, movement, of, plates, has, caused, the, continual, formation, and, breakup, of, continents, and, occasionally, supercontinents, in, a, process, called, the, wilson, cycle, the, supercontinent, columbia, or, nuna, formed, during, a, period, of, 2, 0, 1, 8, billion, years, ago, and, broke, up, about, 1, 5, 1, 3, billion, years, ago, the, supercontinent, rodinia, is, thought, to, have, formed, about, 1, billion, years, ago, and, to, have, embodied, most, or, all, of, earth, s, continents, and, broken, up, into, eight, continents, around, 600, million, years, ago, the, eight, continents, later, reassembled, into, another, supercontinent, called, pangaea, pangaea, broke, up, into, laurasia, which, became, north, america, and, eurasia, and, gondwana, which, became, the, remaining, continents, africa, antarctica, asia, australia, europe, north, america, south, america, afro, eurasia, americas, eurasia, oceania
