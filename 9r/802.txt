a, lake, is, an, often, naturally, occurring, relatively, large, and, fixed, body, of, water, on, or, near, the, earth, s, surface, it, is, localized, in, a, basin, or, interconnected, basins, surrounded, by, dry, land, lakes, lie, completely, on, land, and, are, separate, from, the, ocean, although, they, may, be, connected, with, the, ocean, by, rivers, most, lakes, are, freshwater, and, account, for, almost, all, the, world, s, surface, freshwater, but, some, are, salt, lakes, with, salinities, even, higher, than, that, of, seawater, lakes, vary, significantly, in, surface, area, and, volume, of, water, lakes, are, typically, larger, and, deeper, than, ponds, which, are, also, water, filled, basins, on, land, although, there, are, no, official, definitions, or, scientific, criteria, distinguishing, the, two, lakes, are, also, distinct, from, lagoons, which, are, generally, shallow, tidal, pools, dammed, by, sandbars, or, other, material, at, coastal, regions, of, oceans, or, large, lakes, most, lakes, are, fed, by, springs, and, both, fed, and, drained, by, creeks, and, rivers, but, some, lakes, are, endorheic, without, any, outflow, while, volcanic, lakes, are, filled, directly, by, precipitation, runoffs, and, do, not, have, any, inflow, streams, natural, lakes, are, generally, found, in, mountainous, areas, i, e, alpine, lakes, dormant, volcanic, craters, rift, zones, and, areas, with, ongoing, glaciation, other, lakes, are, found, in, depressed, landforms, or, along, the, courses, of, mature, rivers, where, a, river, channel, has, widened, over, a, basin, formed, by, eroded, floodplains, and, wetlands, some, lakes, are, found, in, caverns, underground, some, parts, of, the, world, have, many, lakes, formed, by, the, chaotic, drainage, patterns, left, over, from, the, last, ice, age, all, lakes, are, temporary, over, long, periods, of, time, as, they, will, slowly, fill, in, with, sediments, or, spill, out, of, the, basin, containing, them, artificially, controlled, lakes, are, known, as, reservoirs, and, are, usually, constructed, for, industrial, or, agricultural, use, for, hydroelectric, power, generation, for, supplying, domestic, drinking, water, for, ecological, or, recreational, purposes, or, for, other, human, activities, the, word, lake, comes, from, middle, english, lake, lake, pond, waterway, from, old, english, lacu, pond, pool, stream, from, proto, germanic, lak, pond, ditch, slow, moving, stream, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, le, to, leak, drain, cognates, include, dutch, laak, lake, pond, ditch, middle, low, german, l, ke, water, pooled, in, a, riverbed, puddle, as, in, de, wolfslake, de, butterlake, german, lache, pool, puddle, and, icelandic, l, kur, slow, flowing, stream, also, related, are, the, english, words, leak, and, leach, there, is, considerable, uncertainty, about, defining, the, difference, between, lakes, and, ponds, and, neither, term, has, an, internationally, accepted, definition, across, scientific, disciplines, or, political, boundaries, for, example, limnologists, have, defined, lakes, as, water, bodies, that, are, simply, a, larger, version, of, a, pond, which, can, have, wave, action, on, the, shoreline, or, where, wind, induced, turbulence, plays, a, major, role, in, mixing, the, water, column, none, of, these, definitions, completely, excludes, ponds, and, all, are, difficult, to, measure, for, this, reason, simple, size, based, definitions, are, increasingly, used, to, separate, ponds, and, lakes, definitions, for, lake, range, in, minimum, sizes, for, a, body, of, water, from, 2, hectares, 5, acres, 331, to, 8, hectares, 20, acres, pioneering, animal, ecologist, charles, elton, regarded, lakes, as, waterbodies, of, 40, hectares, 99, acres, or, more, the, term, lake, is, also, used, to, describe, a, feature, such, as, lake, eyre, which, is, a, dry, basin, most, of, the, time, but, may, become, filled, under, seasonal, conditions, of, heavy, rainfall, in, common, usage, many, lakes, bear, names, ending, with, the, word, pond, and, a, lesser, number, of, names, ending, with, lake, are, in, quasi, technical, fact, ponds, one, textbook, illustrates, this, point, with, the, following, in, newfoundland, for, example, almost, every, lake, is, called, a, pond, whereas, in, wisconsin, almost, every, pond, is, called, a, lake, one, hydrology, book, proposes, to, define, the, term, lake, as, a, body, of, water, with, the, following, five, characteristics, with, the, exception, of, criterion, 3, the, others, have, been, accepted, or, elaborated, upon, by, other, hydrology, publications, the, majority, of, lakes, on, earth, are, freshwater, and, most, lie, in, the, northern, hemisphere, at, higher, latitudes, canada, with, a, deranged, drainage, system, has, an, estimated, 31, 752, lakes, larger, than, 3, square, kilometres, 1, 2, sq, mi, in, surface, area, the, total, number, of, lakes, in, canada, is, unknown, but, is, estimated, to, be, at, least, 2, million, finland, has, 168, 000, lakes, of, 500, square, metres, 5, 400, sq, ft, in, area, or, larger, of, which, 57, 000, are, large, 10, 000, square, metres, 110, 000, sq, ft, or, larger, most, lakes, have, at, least, one, natural, outflow, in, the, form, of, a, river, or, stream, which, maintain, a, lake, s, average, level, by, allowing, the, drainage, of, excess, water, some, lakes, do, not, have, a, natural, outflow, and, lose, water, solely, by, evaporation, or, underground, seepage, or, both, these, are, termed, endorheic, lakes, many, lakes, are, artificial, and, are, constructed, for, hydroelectric, power, generation, aesthetic, purposes, recreational, purposes, industrial, use, agricultural, use, or, domestic, water, supply, the, number, of, lakes, on, earth, is, undetermined, because, most, lakes, and, ponds, are, very, small, and, do, not, appear, on, maps, or, satellite, imagery, despite, this, uncertainty, a, large, number, of, studies, agree, that, small, ponds, are, much, more, abundant, than, large, lakes, for, example, one, widely, cited, study, estimated, that, earth, has, 304, million, lakes, and, ponds, and, that, 91, of, these, are, 1, hectare, 2, 5, acres, or, less, in, area, despite, the, overwhelming, abundance, of, ponds, almost, all, of, earth, s, lake, water, is, found, in, fewer, than, 100, large, lakes, this, is, because, lake, volume, scales, superlinearly, with, lake, area, extraterrestrial, lakes, exist, on, the, moon, titan, which, orbits, the, planet, saturn, the, shape, of, lakes, on, titan, is, very, similar, to, those, on, earth, lakes, were, formerly, present, on, the, surface, of, mars, but, are, now, dry, lake, beds, in, 1957, g, evelyn, hutchinson, published, a, monograph, titled, a, treatise, on, limnology, which, is, regarded, as, a, landmark, discussion, and, classification, of, all, major, lake, types, their, origin, morphometric, characteristics, and, distribution, hutchinson, presented, in, his, publication, a, comprehensive, analysis, of, the, origin, of, lakes, and, proposed, what, is, a, widely, accepted, classification, of, lakes, according, to, their, origin, this, classification, recognizes, 11, major, lake, types, that, are, divided, into, 76, subtypes, the, 11, major, lake, types, are, tectonic, lakes, are, lakes, formed, by, the, deformation, and, resulting, lateral, and, vertical, movements, of, the, earth, s, crust, these, movements, include, faulting, tilting, folding, and, warping, some, of, the, largest, lakes, on, earth, are, rift, lakes, occupying, rift, valleys, e, g, central, african, rift, lakes, and, lake, baikal, other, well, known, tectonic, lakes, caspian, sea, the, sea, of, aral, and, other, lakes, from, the, pontocaspian, occupy, basins, that, have, been, separated, from, the, sea, by, the, tectonic, uplift, of, the, sea, floor, above, the, ocean, level, often, the, tectonic, action, of, crustal, extension, has, created, an, alternating, series, of, parallel, grabens, and, horsts, that, form, elongate, basins, alternating, with, mountain, ranges, not, only, does, this, promote, the, creation, of, lakes, by, the, disruption, of, preexisting, drainage, networks, it, also, creates, within, arid, regions, endorheic, basins, that, contain, salt, lakes, also, called, saline, lakes, they, form, where, there, is, no, natural, outlet, a, high, evaporation, rate, and, the, drainage, surface, of, the, water, table, has, a, higher, than, normal, salt, content, examples, of, these, salt, lakes, include, great, salt, lake, and, the, dead, sea, another, type, of, tectonic, lake, caused, by, faulting, is, sag, ponds, volcanic, lakes, are, lakes, that, occupy, either, local, depressions, e, g, craters, and, maars, or, larger, basins, e, g, calderas, created, by, volcanism, crater, lakes, are, formed, in, volcanic, craters, and, calderas, which, fill, up, with, precipitation, more, rapidly, than, they, empty, via, either, evaporation, groundwater, discharge, or, a, combination, of, both, sometimes, the, latter, are, called, caldera, lakes, although, often, no, distinction, is, made, an, example, is, crater, lake, in, oregon, in, the, caldera, of, mount, mazama, the, caldera, was, created, in, a, massive, volcanic, eruption, that, led, to, the, subsidence, of, mount, mazama, around, 4860, bce, other, volcanic, lakes, are, created, when, either, rivers, or, streams, are, dammed, by, lava, flows, or, volcanic, lahars, the, basin, which, is, now, malheur, lake, oregon, was, created, when, a, lava, flow, dammed, the, malheur, river, among, all, lake, types, volcanic, crater, lakes, most, closely, approximate, a, circular, shape, glacial, lakes, are, lakes, created, by, the, direct, action, of, glaciers, and, continental, ice, sheets, a, wide, variety, of, glacial, processes, create, enclosed, basins, as, a, result, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, different, types, of, glacial, lakes, and, it, is, often, difficult, to, define, clear, cut, distinctions, between, different, types, of, glacial, lakes, and, lakes, influenced, by, other, activities, the, general, types, of, glacial, lakes, that, have, been, recognized, are, lakes, in, direct, contact, with, ice, glacially, carved, rock, basins, and, depressions, morainic, and, outwash, lakes, and, glacial, drift, basins, glacial, lakes, are, the, most, numerous, lakes, in, the, world, most, lakes, in, northern, europe, and, north, america, have, been, either, influenced, or, created, by, the, latest, but, not, last, glaciation, to, have, covered, the, region, glacial, lakes, include, proglacial, lakes, subglacial, lakes, finger, lakes, and, epishelf, lakes, epishelf, lakes, are, highly, stratified, lakes, in, which, a, layer, of, freshwater, derived, from, ice, and, snow, melt, is, dammed, behind, an, ice, shelf, that, is, attached, to, the, coastline, they, are, mostly, found, in, antarctica, fluvial, or, riverine, lakes, are, lakes, produced, by, running, water, these, lakes, include, plunge, pool, lakes, fluviatile, dams, and, meander, lakes, the, most, common, type, of, fluvial, lake, is, a, crescent, shaped, lake, called, an, oxbow, lake, due, to, the, distinctive, curved, shape, they, can, form, in, river, valleys, as, a, result, of, meandering, the, slow, moving, river, forms, a, sinuous, shape, as, the, outer, side, of, bends, are, eroded, away, more, rapidly, than, the, inner, side, eventually, a, horseshoe, bend, is, formed, and, the, river, cuts, through, the, narrow, neck, this, new, passage, then, forms, the, main, passage, for, the, river, and, the, ends, of, the, bend, become, silted, up, thus, forming, a, bow, shaped, lake, their, crescent, shape, gives, oxbow, lakes, a, higher, perimeter, to, area, ratio, than, other, lake, types, these, form, where, sediment, from, a, tributary, blocks, the, main, river, these, form, where, sediment, from, the, main, river, blocks, a, tributary, usually, in, the, form, of, a, levee, lakes, formed, by, other, processes, responsible, for, floodplain, basin, creation, during, high, floods, they, are, flushed, with, river, water, there, are, four, types, 1, confluent, floodplain, lake, 2, contrafluent, confluent, floodplain, lake, 3, contrafluent, floodplain, lake, 4, profundal, floodplain, lake, a, solution, lake, is, a, lake, occupying, a, basin, formed, by, surface, dissolution, of, bedrock, in, areas, underlain, by, soluble, bedrock, its, solution, by, precipitation, and, percolating, water, commonly, produce, cavities, these, cavities, frequently, collapse, to, form, sinkholes, that, form, part, of, the, local, karst, topography, where, groundwater, lies, near, the, grounds, surface, a, sinkhole, will, be, filled, water, as, a, solution, lake, if, such, a, lake, consists, of, a, large, area, of, standing, water, that, occupies, an, extensive, closed, depression, in, limestone, it, is, also, called, a, karst, lake, smaller, solution, lakes, that, consist, of, a, body, of, standing, water, in, a, closed, depression, within, a, karst, region, are, known, as, karst, ponds, limestone, caves, often, contain, pools, of, standing, water, which, are, known, as, underground, lakes, classic, examples, of, solution, lakes, are, abundant, in, the, karst, regions, at, the, dalmatian, coast, of, croatia, and, within, large, parts, of, florida, a, landslide, lake, is, created, by, the, blockage, of, a, river, valley, by, either, mudflows, rockslides, or, screes, such, lakes, are, most, common, in, mountainous, regions, although, landslide, lakes, may, be, large, and, quite, deep, they, are, typically, short, lived, an, example, of, a, landslide, lake, is, quake, lake, which, formed, as, a, result, of, the, 1959, hebgen, lake, earthquake, most, landslide, lakes, disappear, in, the, first, few, months, after, formation, but, a, landslide, dam, can, burst, suddenly, at, a, later, stage, and, threaten, the, population, downstream, when, the, lake, water, drains, out, in, 1911, an, earthquake, triggered, a, landslide, that, blocked, a, deep, valley, in, the, pamir, mountains, region, of, tajikistan, forming, the, sarez, lake, the, usoi, dam, at, the, base, of, the, valley, has, remained, in, place, for, more, than, 100, years, but, the, terrain, below, the, lake, is, in, danger, of, a, catastrophic, flood, if, the, dam, were, to, fail, during, a, future, earthquake, tal, y, llyn, lake, in, north, wales, is, a, landslide, lake, dating, back, to, the, last, glaciation, in, wales, some, 20000, years, ago, aeolian, lakes, are, produced, by, wind, action, these, lakes, are, found, mainly, in, arid, environments, although, some, aeolian, lakes, are, relict, landforms, indicative, of, arid, paleoclimates, aeolian, lakes, consist, of, lake, basins, dammed, by, wind, blown, sand, interdunal, lakes, that, lie, between, well, oriented, sand, dunes, and, deflation, basins, formed, by, wind, action, under, previously, arid, paleoenvironments, moses, lake, in, washington, united, states, was, originally, a, shallow, natural, lake, and, an, example, of, a, lake, basin, dammed, by, wind, blown, sand, china, s, badain, jaran, desert, is, a, unique, landscape, of, megadunes, and, elongated, interdunal, aeolian, lakes, particularly, concentrated, in, the, southeastern, margin, of, the, desert, shoreline, lakes, are, generally, lakes, created, by, blockage, of, estuaries, or, by, the, uneven, accretion, of, beach, ridges, by, longshore, and, other, currents, they, include, maritime, coastal, lakes, ordinarily, in, drowned, estuaries, lakes, enclosed, by, two, tombolos, or, spits, connecting, an, island, to, the, mainland, lakes, cut, off, from, larger, lakes, by, a, bar, or, lakes, divided, by, the, meeting, of, two, spits, organic, lakes, are, lakes, created, by, the, actions, of, plants, and, animals, on, the, whole, they, are, relatively, rare, in, occurrence, and, quite, small, in, size, in, addition, they, typically, have, ephemeral, features, relative, to, the, other, types, of, lakes, the, basins, in, which, organic, lakes, occur, are, associated, with, beaver, dams, coral, lakes, or, dams, formed, by, vegetation, peat, lakes, are, a, form, of, organic, lake, they, form, where, a, buildup, of, partly, decomposed, plant, material, in, a, wet, environment, leaves, the, vegetated, surface, below, the, water, table, for, a, sustained, period, of, time, they, are, often, low, in, nutrients, and, mildly, acidic, with, bottom, waters, low, in, dissolved, oxygen, artificial, lakes, or, anthropogenic, lakes, are, large, waterbodies, created, by, human, activity, they, can, be, formed, by, the, intentional, damming, of, rivers, and, streams, rerouting, of, water, to, inundate, a, previously, dry, basin, or, the, deliberate, filling, of, abandoned, excavation, pits, by, either, precipitation, runoff, ground, water, or, a, combination, of, both, artificial, lakes, may, be, used, as, storage, reservoirs, that, provide, drinking, water, for, nearby, settlements, to, generate, hydroelectricity, for, flood, management, for, supplying, agriculture, or, aquaculture, or, to, provide, an, aquatic, sanctuary, for, parks, and, nature, reserves, the, upper, silesian, region, of, southern, poland, contains, an, anthropogenic, lake, district, consisting, of, more, than, 4, 000, water, bodies, created, by, human, activity, the, diverse, origins, of, these, lakes, include, reservoirs, retained, by, dams, flooded, mines, water, bodies, formed, in, subsidence, basins, and, hollows, levee, ponds, and, residual, water, bodies, following, river, regulation, same, for, the, lusatian, lake, district, germany, see, list, of, notable, artificial, lakes, in, the, united, states, meteorite, lakes, also, known, as, crater, lakes, not, to, be, confused, with, volcanic, crater, lakes, are, created, by, catastrophic, impacts, with, the, earth, by, extraterrestrial, objects, either, meteorites, or, asteroids, examples, of, meteorite, lakes, are, lonar, lake, in, india, lake, el, gygytgyn, in, northeast, siberia, and, the, pingualuit, crater, lake, in, quebec, canada, as, in, the, cases, of, el, gygytgyn, and, pingualuit, meteorite, lakes, can, contain, unique, and, scientifically, valuable, sedimentary, deposits, associated, with, long, records, of, paleoclimatic, changes, in, addition, to, the, mode, of, origin, lakes, have, been, named, and, classified, according, to, various, other, important, factors, such, as, thermal, stratification, oxygen, saturation, seasonal, variations, in, lake, volume, and, water, level, salinity, of, the, water, mass, relative, seasonal, permanence, degree, of, outflow, and, so, on, the, names, used, by, the, lay, public, and, in, the, scientific, community, for, different, types, of, lakes, are, often, informally, derived, from, the, morphology, of, the, lakes, physical, characteristics, or, other, factors, also, different, cultures, and, regions, of, the, world, have, their, own, popular, nomenclature, one, important, method, of, lake, classification, is, on, the, basis, of, thermal, stratification, which, has, a, major, influence, on, the, animal, and, plant, life, inhabiting, a, lake, and, the, fate, and, distribution, of, dissolved, and, suspended, material, in, the, lake, for, example, the, thermal, stratification, as, well, as, the, degree, and, frequency, of, mixing, has, a, strong, control, over, the, distribution, of, oxygen, within, the, lake, professor, f, a, forel, also, referred, to, as, the, father, of, limnology, was, the, first, scientist, to, classify, lakes, according, to, their, thermal, stratification, his, system, of, classification, was, later, modified, and, improved, upon, by, hutchinson, and, l, ffler, as, the, density, of, water, varies, with, temperature, with, a, maximum, at, 4, degrees, celsius, thermal, stratification, is, an, important, physical, characteristic, of, a, lake, that, controls, the, fauna, and, flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and, other, aspects, of, individual, lakes, first, the, colder, denser, water, typically, forms, a, layer, near, the, bottom, which, is, called, the, hypolimnion, second, normally, overlying, the, hypolimnion, is, a, transition, zone, known, as, the, metalimnion, finally, overlying, the, metalimnion, is, a, surface, layer, of, warmer, water, with, a, lower, density, called, the, epilimnion, this, typical, stratification, sequence, can, vary, widely, depending, on, the, specific, lake, or, the, time, of, year, or, a, combination, of, both, the, classification, of, lakes, by, thermal, stratification, presupposes, lakes, with, sufficient, depth, to, form, a, hypolimnion, accordingly, very, shallow, lakes, are, excluded, from, this, classification, system, based, upon, their, thermal, stratification, lakes, are, classified, as, either, holomictic, with, a, uniform, temperature, and, density, from, top, to, bottom, at, a, given, time, of, year, or, meromictic, with, layers, of, water, of, different, temperature, and, density, that, do, not, intermix, the, deepest, layer, of, water, in, a, meromictic, lake, does, not, contain, any, dissolved, oxygen, so, there, are, no, living, aerobic, organisms, consequently, the, layers, of, sediment, at, the, bottom, of, a, meromictic, lake, remain, relatively, undisturbed, which, allows, for, the, development, of, lacustrine, deposits, in, a, holomictic, lake, the, uniformity, of, temperature, and, density, allows, the, lake, waters, to, completely, mix, based, upon, thermal, stratification, and, frequency, of, turnover, holomictic, lakes, are, divided, into, amictic, lakes, cold, monomictic, lakes, dimictic, lakes, warm, monomictic, lakes, polymictic, lakes, and, oligomictic, lakes, lake, stratification, does, not, always, result, from, a, variation, in, density, because, of, thermal, gradients, stratification, can, also, result, from, a, density, variation, caused, by, gradients, in, salinity, in, this, case, the, hypolimnion, and, epilimnion, are, separated, not, by, a, thermocline, but, by, a, halocline, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, chemocline, lakes, are, informally, classified, and, named, according, to, the, seasonal, variation, in, their, lake, level, and, volume, some, of, the, names, include, lakes, may, be, informally, classified, and, named, according, to, the, general, chemistry, of, their, water, mass, using, this, classification, method, the, lake, types, include, a, paleolake, also, palaeolake, is, a, lake, that, existed, in, the, past, when, hydrological, conditions, were, different, quaternary, paleolakes, can, often, be, identified, on, the, basis, of, relict, lacustrine, landforms, such, as, relict, lake, plains, and, coastal, landforms, that, form, recognizable, relict, shorelines, called, paleoshorelines, paleolakes, can, also, be, recognized, by, characteristic, sedimentary, deposits, that, accumulated, in, them, and, any, fossils, that, might, be, contained, in, these, sediments, the, paleoshorelines, and, sedimentary, deposits, of, paleolakes, provide, evidence, for, prehistoric, hydrological, changes, during, the, times, that, they, existed, there, are, two, types, of, paleolake, paleolakes, are, of, scientific, and, economic, importance, for, example, quaternary, paleolakes, in, semidesert, basins, are, important, for, two, reasons, they, played, an, extremely, significant, if, transient, role, in, shaping, the, floors, and, piedmonts, of, many, basins, and, their, sediments, contain, enormous, quantities, of, geologic, and, paleontologic, information, concerning, past, environments, in, addition, the, organic, rich, deposits, of, pre, quaternary, paleolakes, are, important, either, for, the, thick, deposits, of, oil, shale, and, shale, gas, contained, in, them, or, as, source, rocks, of, petroleum, and, natural, gas, although, of, significantly, less, economic, importance, strata, deposited, along, the, shore, of, paleolakes, sometimes, contain, coal, seams, lakes, have, numerous, features, in, addition, to, lake, type, such, as, drainage, basin, also, known, as, catchment, area, inflow, and, outflow, nutrient, content, dissolved, oxygen, pollutants, ph, and, sedimentation, changes, in, the, level, of, a, lake, are, controlled, by, the, difference, between, the, input, and, output, compared, to, the, total, volume, of, the, lake, significant, input, sources, are, precipitation, onto, the, lake, runoff, carried, by, streams, and, channels, from, the, lake, s, catchment, area, groundwater, channels, and, aquifers, and, artificial, sources, from, outside, the, catchment, area, output, sources, are, evaporation, from, the, lake, surface, and, groundwater, flows, and, any, extraction, of, lake, water, by, humans, as, climate, conditions, and, human, water, requirements, vary, these, will, create, fluctuations, in, the, lake, level, lakes, can, be, also, categorized, on, the, basis, of, their, richness, in, nutrients, which, typically, affect, plant, growth, nutrient, poor, lakes, are, said, to, be, oligotrophic, and, are, generally, clear, having, a, low, concentration, of, plant, life, mesotrophic, lakes, have, good, clarity, and, an, average, level, of, nutrients, eutrophic, lakes, are, enriched, with, nutrients, resulting, in, good, plant, growth, and, possible, algal, blooms, hypertrophic, lakes, are, bodies, of, water, that, have, been, excessively, enriched, with, nutrients, these, lakes, typically, have, poor, clarity, and, are, subject, to, devastating, algal, blooms, lakes, typically, reach, this, condition, due, to, human, activities, such, as, heavy, use, of, fertilizers, in, the, lake, catchment, area, such, lakes, are, of, little, use, to, humans, and, have, a, poor, ecosystem, due, to, decreased, dissolved, oxygen, due, to, the, unusual, relationship, between, water, s, temperature, and, its, density, lakes, form, layers, called, thermoclines, layers, of, drastically, varying, temperature, relative, to, depth, fresh, water, is, most, dense, at, about, 4, degrees, celsius, 39, 2, f, at, sea, level, when, the, temperature, of, the, water, at, the, surface, of, a, lake, reaches, the, same, temperature, as, deeper, water, as, it, does, during, the, cooler, months, in, temperate, climates, the, water, in, the, lake, can, mix, bringing, oxygen, starved, water, up, from, the, depths, and, bringing, oxygen, down, to, decomposing, sediments, deep, temperate, lakes, can, maintain, a, reservoir, of, cold, water, year, round, which, allows, some, cities, to, tap, that, reservoir, for, deep, lake, water, cooling, since, the, surface, water, of, deep, tropical, lakes, never, reaches, the, temperature, of, maximum, density, there, is, no, process, that, makes, the, water, mix, the, deeper, layer, becomes, oxygen, starved, and, can, become, saturated, with, carbon, dioxide, or, other, gases, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, if, there, is, even, a, trace, of, volcanic, activity, exceptional, events, such, as, earthquakes, or, landslides, can, cause, mixing, which, rapidly, brings, the, deep, layers, up, to, the, surface, and, release, a, vast, cloud, of, gas, which, lay, trapped, in, solution, in, the, colder, water, at, the, bottom, of, the, lake, this, is, called, a, limnic, eruption, an, example, is, the, disaster, at, lake, nyos, in, cameroon, the, amount, of, gas, that, can, be, dissolved, in, water, is, directly, related, to, pressure, as, deep, water, surfaces, the, pressure, drops, and, a, vast, amount, of, gas, comes, out, of, solution, under, these, circumstances, carbon, dioxide, is, hazardous, because, it, is, heavier, than, air, and, displaces, it, so, it, may, flow, down, a, river, valley, to, human, settlements, and, cause, mass, asphyxiation, the, material, at, the, bottom, of, a, lake, or, lake, bed, may, be, composed, of, a, wide, variety, of, inorganics, such, as, silt, or, sand, and, organic, material, such, as, decaying, plant, or, animal, matter, the, composition, of, the, lake, bed, has, a, significant, impact, on, the, flora, and, fauna, found, within, the, lake, s, environs, by, contributing, to, the, amounts, and, the, types, of, nutrients, available, a, paired, black, and, white, layer, of, the, varved, lake, sediments, correspond, to, a, year, during, winter, when, organisms, die, carbon, is, deposited, down, resulting, to, a, black, layer, at, the, same, year, during, summer, only, few, organic, materials, are, deposited, resulting, to, a, white, layer, at, the, lake, bed, these, are, commonly, used, to, track, past, paleontological, events, natural, lakes, provide, a, microcosm, of, living, and, nonliving, elements, that, are, relatively, independent, of, their, surrounding, environments, therefore, lake, organisms, can, often, be, studied, in, isolation, from, the, lake, s, surroundings, limnology, is, the, study, of, inland, bodies, of, water, and, related, ecosystems, limnology, divides, lakes, into, three, zones, the, littoral, zone, a, sloped, area, close, to, land, the, photic, or, open, water, zone, where, sunlight, is, abundant, and, the, deep, water, profundal, or, benthic, zone, where, little, sunlight, can, reach, the, depth, to, which, light, can, penetrate, depends, on, the, turbidity, of, the, water, which, is, determined, by, the, density, and, size, of, suspended, particles, a, particle, will, be, in, suspension, if, its, weight, is, less, than, the, random, turbidity, forces, acting, upon, it, these, particles, can, be, sedimentary, or, biological, in, origin, including, algae, and, detritus, and, are, responsible, for, the, color, of, the, water, decaying, plant, matter, for, instance, may, account, for, a, yellow, or, brown, color, while, algae, may, cause, a, greenish, coloration, in, very, shallow, water, bodies, iron, oxides, make, the, water, reddish, brown, bottom, dwelling, detritivorous, fish, stir, the, mud, in, search, of, food, and, can, be, the, cause, of, turbid, waters, piscivorous, fish, contribute, to, turbidity, by, eating, plant, eating, planktonivorous, fish, thus, increasing, the, amount, of, algae, see, aquatic, trophic, cascade, the, light, depth, or, transparency, is, measured, using, a, secchi, disk, a, 20, cm, 8, in, disk, with, alternating, white, and, black, quadrants, the, depth, at, which, the, disk, is, no, longer, visible, is, the, secchi, depth, a, measure, of, transparency, the, secchi, disk, is, commonly, used, to, test, for, eutrophication, for, a, detailed, look, at, these, processes, see, lentic, ecosystems, a, lake, moderates, the, surrounding, region, s, temperature, and, climate, because, water, has, a, very, high, specific, heat, capacity, 4, 186, j, kg, 1, k, 1, in, the, daytime, a, lake, can, cool, the, land, beside, it, with, local, winds, resulting, in, a, sea, breeze, in, the, night, it, can, warm, it, with, a, land, breeze, lake, zones, algal, community, types, the, lake, may, be, infilled, with, deposited, sediment, and, gradually, become, a, wetland, such, as, a, swamp, or, marsh, large, water, plants, typically, reeds, accelerate, this, closing, process, significantly, because, they, partially, decompose, to, form, peat, soils, that, fill, the, shallows, conversely, peat, soils, in, a, marsh, can, naturally, burn, and, reverse, this, process, to, recreate, a, shallow, lake, resulting, in, a, dynamic, equilibrium, between, marsh, and, lake, this, is, significant, since, wildfire, has, been, largely, suppressed, in, the, developed, world, over, the, past, century, this, has, artificially, converted, many, shallow, lakes, into, emergent, marshes, turbid, lakes, and, lakes, with, many, plant, eating, fish, tend, to, disappear, more, slowly, a, disappearing, lake, barely, noticeable, on, a, human, timescale, typically, has, extensive, plant, mats, at, the, water, s, edge, these, become, a, new, habitat, for, other, plants, like, peat, moss, when, conditions, are, right, and, animals, many, of, which, are, very, rare, gradually, the, lake, closes, and, young, peat, may, form, forming, a, fen, in, lowland, river, valleys, where, a, river, can, meander, the, presence, of, peat, is, explained, by, the, infilling, of, historical, oxbow, lakes, in, the, final, stages, of, succession, trees, can, grow, in, eventually, turning, the, wetland, into, a, forest, some, lakes, can, disappear, seasonally, these, are, called, intermittent, lakes, ephemeral, lakes, or, seasonal, lakes, and, can, be, found, in, karstic, terrain, a, prime, example, of, an, intermittent, lake, is, lake, cerknica, in, slovenia, or, lag, prau, pulte, in, graub, nden, other, intermittent, lakes, are, only, the, result, of, above, average, precipitation, in, a, closed, or, endorheic, basin, usually, filling, dry, lake, beds, this, can, occur, in, some, of, the, driest, places, on, earth, like, death, valley, this, occurred, in, the, spring, of, 2005, after, unusually, heavy, rains, the, lake, did, not, last, into, the, summer, and, was, quickly, evaporated, see, photos, to, right, a, more, commonly, filled, lake, of, this, type, is, sevier, lake, of, west, central, utah, sometimes, a, lake, will, disappear, quickly, on, 3, june, 2005, in, nizhny, novgorod, oblast, russia, a, lake, called, lake, beloye, vanished, in, a, matter, of, minutes, news, sources, reported, that, government, officials, theorized, that, this, strange, phenomenon, may, have, been, caused, by, a, shift, in, the, soil, underneath, the, lake, that, allowed, its, water, to, drain, through, channels, leading, to, the, oka, river, the, presence, of, ground, permafrost, is, important, to, the, persistence, of, some, lakes, thawing, permafrost, may, explain, the, shrinking, or, disappearance, of, hundreds, of, large, arctic, lakes, across, western, siberia, the, idea, here, is, that, rising, air, and, soil, temperatures, thaw, permafrost, allowing, the, lakes, to, drain, away, into, the, ground, some, lakes, disappear, because, of, human, development, factors, the, shrinking, aral, sea, is, described, as, being, murdered, by, the, diversion, for, irrigation, of, the, rivers, feeding, it, between, 1990, and, 2020, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, large, lakes, decreased, in, size, in, part, due, to, climate, change, only, one, astronomical, body, other, than, earth, is, known, to, harbor, large, lakes, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, photographs, and, spectroscopic, analysis, by, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, show, liquid, ethane, on, the, surface, which, is, thought, to, be, mixed, with, liquid, methane, the, largest, lake, on, titan, is, kraken, mare, which, at, an, estimated, 400, 000, km, 2, is, roughly, five, times, the, size, of, lake, superior, 80, 000, km, 2, and, nearly, the, size, of, all, five, great, lakes, of, north, america, combined, the, second, largest, titanean, lake, ligeia, mare, is, almost, twice, the, size, of, lake, superior, at, an, estimated, 150, 000, km, 2, jupiter, s, large, moon, io, is, volcanically, active, leading, to, the, accumulation, of, sulfur, deposits, on, the, surface, some, photographs, taken, during, the, galileo, mission, appear, to, show, lakes, of, liquid, sulfur, in, volcanic, caldera, though, these, are, more, analogous, to, lakes, of, lava, than, of, water, on, earth, the, planet, mars, has, only, one, confirmed, lake, which, is, underground, and, near, the, south, pole, although, the, surface, of, mars, is, too, cold, and, has, too, little, atmospheric, pressure, to, permit, permanent, surface, water, geologic, evidence, appears, to, confirm, that, ancient, lakes, once, formed, on, the, surface, there, are, dark, basaltic, plains, on, the, moon, similar, to, lunar, maria, but, smaller, which, are, called, lacus, singular, lacus, latin, for, lake, because, they, were, thought, by, early, astronomers, to, be, lakes, of, water, the, largest, lakes, surface, area, by, continent, are
