the, henry, symbol, h, is, the, unit, of, electrical, inductance, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, if, a, current, of, 1, ampere, flowing, through, a, coil, produces, flux, linkage, of, 1, weber, turn, that, coil, has, a, self, inductance, of, 1, henry, the, unit, is, named, after, joseph, henry, 1797, 1878, the, american, scientist, who, discovered, electromagnetic, induction, independently, of, and, at, about, the, same, time, as, michael, faraday, 1791, 1867, in, england, the, inductance, of, an, electric, circuit, is, one, henry, when, an, electric, current, that, is, changing, at, one, ampere, per, second, results, in, an, electromotive, force, of, one, volt, across, the, inductor, where, v, t, is, the, resulting, voltage, across, the, circuit, i, t, is, the, current, through, the, circuit, and, l, is, the, inductance, of, the, circuit, the, henry, is, a, derived, unit, based, on, four, of, the, seven, base, units, of, the, international, system, of, units, kilogram, kg, metre, m, second, s, and, ampere, a, expressed, in, combinations, of, si, units, the, henry, is, where, h, henry, kg, kilogram, m, metre, s, second, a, ampere, n, newton, c, coulomb, j, joule, t, tesla, wb, weber, v, volt, f, farad, ohm, hz, hertz, rad, radian, the, international, system, of, units, si, specifies, that, the, symbol, of, a, unit, named, for, a, person, is, written, with, an, initial, capital, letter, while, the, name, is, not, capitalized, in, sentence, text, except, when, any, word, in, that, position, would, be, capitalized, such, as, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, or, in, material, using, title, case, the, united, states, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, recommends, users, writing, in, english, to, use, the, plural, as, henries, the, inductance, of, a, coil, depends, on, its, size, the, number, of, turns, and, the, permeability, of, the, material, within, and, surrounding, the, coil, formulae, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, inductance, of, many, common, arrangements, of, conductors, such, as, parallel, wires, or, a, solenoid, a, small, air, core, coil, used, for, broadcast, am, radio, tuning, might, have, an, inductance, of, a, few, tens, of, microhenries, a, large, motor, winding, with, many, turns, around, an, iron, core, may, have, an, inductance, of, hundreds, of, henries, the, physical, size, of, an, inductance, is, also, related, to, its, current, carrying, and, voltage, withstand, ratings
