sublimation, is, the, transition, of, a, substance, directly, from, the, solid, to, the, gas, state, without, passing, through, the, liquid, state, the, verb, form, of, sublimation, is, sublime, or, less, preferably, sublimate, sublimate, also, refers, to, the, product, obtained, by, sublimation, the, point, at, which, sublimation, occurs, rapidly, for, further, details, see, below, is, called, critical, sublimation, point, or, simply, sublimation, point, notable, examples, include, sublimation, of, dry, ice, at, room, temperature, and, atmospheric, pressure, and, that, of, solid, iodine, with, heating, the, reverse, process, of, sublimation, is, deposition, also, called, desublimation, in, which, a, substance, passes, directly, from, a, gas, to, a, solid, phase, without, passing, through, the, liquid, state, all, solids, sublime, though, most, sublime, at, extremely, low, rates, that, are, hardly, detectable, at, normal, pressures, most, chemical, compounds, and, elements, possess, three, different, states, at, different, temperatures, in, these, cases, the, transition, from, the, solid, to, the, gas, state, requires, an, intermediate, liquid, state, the, pressure, referred, to, is, the, partial, pressure, of, the, substance, not, the, total, e, g, atmospheric, pressure, of, the, entire, system, thus, any, solid, can, sublime, if, its, vapour, pressure, is, higher, than, the, surrounding, partial, pressure, of, the, same, substance, and, in, some, cases, sublimes, at, an, appreciable, rate, e, g, water, ice, just, below, 0, c, for, some, substances, such, as, carbon, and, arsenic, sublimation, from, solid, state, is, much, more, achievable, than, evaporation, from, liquid, state, and, it, is, difficult, to, obtain, them, as, liquids, this, is, because, the, pressure, of, their, triple, point, in, its, phase, diagram, which, corresponds, to, the, lowest, pressure, at, which, the, substance, can, exist, as, a, liquid, is, very, high, sublimation, is, caused, by, the, absorption, of, heat, which, provides, enough, energy, for, some, molecules, to, overcome, the, attractive, forces, of, their, neighbors, and, escape, into, the, vapor, phase, since, the, process, requires, additional, energy, sublimation, is, an, endothermic, change, the, enthalpy, of, sublimation, also, called, heat, of, sublimation, can, be, calculated, by, adding, the, enthalpy, of, fusion, and, the, enthalpy, of, vaporization, while, the, definition, of, sublimation, is, simple, there, is, often, confusion, as, to, what, counts, as, a, sublimation, vaporization, from, liquid, to, gas, is, divided, into, two, types, vaporization, on, the, surface, of, the, liquid, is, called, evaporation, and, vaporization, at, the, boiling, point, with, formation, of, bubbles, in, the, interior, of, the, liquid, is, called, boiling, however, there, is, no, such, distinction, for, the, solid, to, gas, transition, which, is, always, called, sublimation, in, both, corresponding, cases, for, clarification, a, distinction, between, the, two, corresponding, cases, is, needed, with, reference, to, a, phase, diagram, the, sublimation, that, occurs, left, of, the, solid, gas, boundary, the, triple, point, or, the, solid, liquid, boundary, corresponding, to, evaporation, in, vaporization, may, be, called, gradual, sublimation, and, the, substance, sublimes, gradually, regardless, of, rate, the, sublimation, that, occurs, at, the, solid, gas, boundary, critical, sublimation, point, corresponding, to, boiling, in, vaporization, may, be, called, rapid, sublimation, and, the, substance, sublimes, rapidly, the, words, gradual, and, rapid, have, acquired, special, meanings, in, this, context, and, no, longer, describe, the, rate, of, sublimation, the, term, sublimation, refers, specifically, to, a, physical, change, of, state, and, is, not, used, to, describe, the, transformation, of, a, solid, to, a, gas, in, a, chemical, reaction, for, example, the, dissociation, on, heating, of, solid, ammonium, chloride, into, hydrogen, chloride, and, ammonia, is, not, sublimation, but, a, chemical, reaction, similarly, the, combustion, of, candles, containing, paraffin, wax, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, is, not, sublimation, but, a, chemical, reaction, with, oxygen, sublimation, is, historically, used, as, a, generic, term, to, describe, a, two, step, phase, transition, a, solid, to, gas, transition, sublimation, in, a, more, precise, definition, followed, by, a, gas, to, solid, transition, deposition, see, below, solid, carbon, dioxide, dry, ice, sublimes, rapidly, along, the, solid, gas, boundary, sublimation, point, below, the, triple, point, e, g, at, the, temperature, of, 78, 5, c, at, atmospheric, pressure, whereas, its, melting, into, liquid, co, 2, can, occur, along, the, solid, liquid, boundary, melting, point, at, pressures, and, temperatures, above, the, triple, point, i, e, 5, 1, atm, 56, 6, c, snow, and, ice, sublime, gradually, at, temperatures, below, the, solid, liquid, boundary, melting, point, generally, 0, c, and, at, partial, pressures, below, the, triple, point, pressure, of, 612, pa, 0, 00604, atm, at, a, low, rate, in, freeze, drying, the, material, to, be, dehydrated, is, frozen, and, its, water, is, allowed, to, sublime, under, reduced, pressure, or, vacuum, the, loss, of, snow, from, a, snowfield, during, a, cold, spell, is, often, caused, by, sunshine, acting, directly, on, the, upper, layers, of, the, snow, sublimation, of, ice, is, a, factor, to, the, erosive, wear, of, glacier, ice, also, called, ablation, in, glaciology, naphthalene, an, organic, compound, commonly, found, in, pesticides, such, as, mothballs, sublimes, easily, because, it, is, made, of, non, polar, molecules, that, are, held, together, only, by, van, der, waals, intermolecular, forces, naphthalene, is, a, solid, that, sublimes, gradually, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, at, a, high, rate, with, the, critical, sublimation, point, at, around, 80, c, 176, f, at, low, temperature, its, vapour, pressure, is, high, enough, 1, mmhg, at, 53, c, to, make, the, solid, form, of, naphthalene, evaporate, into, gas, on, cool, surfaces, the, naphthalene, vapours, will, solidify, to, form, needle, like, crystals, iodine, gradually, sublimes, and, produces, visible, fumes, on, gentle, heating, at, standard, atmospheric, temperature, it, is, possible, to, obtain, liquid, iodine, at, atmospheric, pressure, by, controlling, the, temperature, at, just, between, the, melting, point, and, the, boiling, point, of, iodine, in, forensic, science, iodine, vapor, can, reveal, latent, fingerprints, on, paper, arsenic, can, sublime, readily, at, high, temperatures, cadmium, and, zinc, sublime, much, more, than, other, common, materials, so, they, are, not, suitable, materials, for, use, in, vacuum, sublimation, is, a, technique, used, by, chemists, to, purify, compounds, a, solid, is, typically, placed, in, a, sublimation, apparatus, and, heated, under, vacuum, under, this, reduced, pressure, the, solid, volatilizes, and, condenses, as, a, purified, compound, on, a, cooled, surface, cold, finger, leaving, a, non, volatile, residue, of, impurities, behind, once, heating, ceases, and, the, vacuum, is, removed, the, purified, compound, may, be, collected, from, the, cooling, surface, for, even, higher, purification, efficiencies, a, temperature, gradient, is, applied, which, also, allows, for, the, separation, of, different, fractions, typical, setups, use, an, evacuated, glass, tube, that, is, heated, gradually, in, a, controlled, manner, the, material, flow, is, from, the, hot, end, where, the, initial, material, is, placed, to, the, cold, end, that, is, connected, to, a, pump, stand, by, controlling, temperatures, along, the, length, of, the, tube, the, operator, can, control, the, zones, of, re, condensation, with, very, volatile, compounds, being, pumped, out, of, the, system, completely, or, caught, by, a, separate, cold, trap, moderately, volatile, compounds, re, condensing, along, the, tube, according, to, their, different, volatilities, and, non, volatile, compounds, remaining, in, the, hot, end, vacuum, sublimation, of, this, type, is, also, the, method, of, choice, for, purification, of, organic, compounds, for, use, in, the, organic, electronics, industry, where, very, high, purities, often, 99, 99, are, needed, to, satisfy, the, standards, for, consumer, electronics, and, other, applications, in, ancient, alchemy, a, protoscience, that, contributed, to, the, development, of, modern, chemistry, and, medicine, alchemists, developed, a, structure, of, basic, laboratory, techniques, theory, terminology, and, experimental, methods, sublimation, was, used, to, refer, to, the, process, in, which, a, substance, is, heated, to, a, vapor, then, immediately, collects, as, sediment, on, the, upper, portion, and, neck, of, the, heating, medium, typically, a, retort, or, alembic, but, can, also, be, used, to, describe, other, similar, non, laboratory, transitions, it, was, mentioned, by, alchemical, authors, such, as, basil, valentine, and, george, ripley, and, in, the, rosarium, philosophorum, as, a, process, necessary, for, the, completion, of, the, magnum, opus, here, the, word, sublimation, was, used, to, describe, an, exchange, of, bodies, and, spirits, similar, to, laboratory, phase, transition, between, solids, and, gases, valentine, in, his, le, char, triomphal, de, l, antimoine, triumphal, chariot, of, antimony, published, 1646, made, a, comparison, to, spagyrics, in, which, a, vegetable, sublimation, can, be, used, to, separate, the, spirits, in, wine, and, beer, ripley, used, language, more, indicative, of, the, mystical, implications, of, sublimation, indicating, that, the, process, has, a, double, aspect, in, the, spiritualization, of, the, body, and, the, corporalizing, of, the, spirit, he, writes, and, sublimations, we, make, for, three, causes, the, first, cause, is, to, make, the, body, spiritual, the, second, is, that, the, spirit, may, be, corporeal, and, become, fixed, with, it, and, consubstantial, the, third, cause, is, that, from, its, filthy, original, it, may, be, cleansed, and, its, saltiness, sulphurious, may, be, diminished, in, it, which, is, infectious, the, enthalpy, of, sublimation, has, commonly, been, predicted, using, the, equipartition, theorem, if, the, lattice, energy, is, assumed, to, be, approximately, half, the, packing, energy, then, the, following, thermodynamic, corrections, can, be, applied, to, predict, the, enthalpy, of, sublimation, assuming, a, 1, molar, ideal, gas, gives, a, correction, for, the, thermodynamic, environment, pressure, and, volume, in, which, pv, rt, hence, a, correction, of, 1rt, additional, corrections, for, the, vibrations, rotations, and, translation, then, need, to, be, applied, from, the, equipartition, theorem, gaseous, rotation, and, translation, contribute, 1, 5rt, each, to, the, final, state, therefore, a, 3rt, correction, crystalline, vibrations, and, rotations, contribute, 3rt, each, to, the, initial, state, hence, 6rt, summing, the, rt, corrections, 6rt, 3rt, rt, 2rt, this, leads, to, the, following, approximate, sublimation, enthalpy, a, similar, approximation, can, be, found, for, the, entropy, term, if, rigid, bodies, are, assumed, h, sublimation, u, lattice, energy, 2, r, t, displaystyle, delta, h, text, sublimation, u, text, lattice, energy, 2rt, dye, sub, printing, is, a, digital, printing, technology, using, full, color, artwork, that, works, with, polyester, and, polymer, coated, substrates, also, referred, to, as, digital, sublimation, the, process, is, commonly, used, for, decorating, apparel, signs, and, banners, as, well, as, novelty, items, such, as, cell, phone, covers, plaques, coffee, mugs, and, other, items, with, sublimation, friendly, surfaces, the, process, uses, the, science, of, sublimation, in, which, heat, and, pressure, are, applied, to, a, solid, turning, it, into, a, gas, through, an, endothermic, reaction, without, passing, through, the, liquid, phase, in, sublimation, printing, unique, sublimation, dyes, are, transferred, to, sheets, of, transfer, paper, via, liquid, gel, ink, through, a, piezoelectric, print, head, the, ink, is, deposited, on, these, high, release, inkjet, papers, which, are, used, for, the, next, step, of, the, sublimation, printing, process, after, the, digital, design, is, printed, onto, sublimation, transfer, sheets, it, is, placed, on, a, heat, press, along, with, the, substrate, to, be, sublimated, in, order, to, transfer, the, image, from, the, paper, to, the, substrate, it, requires, a, heat, press, process, that, is, a, combination, of, time, temperature, and, pressure, the, heat, press, applies, this, special, combination, which, can, change, depending, on, the, substrate, to, transfer, the, sublimation, dyes, at, the, molecular, level, into, the, substrate, the, most, common, dyes, used, for, sublimation, activate, at, 350, degrees, fahrenheit, however, a, range, of, 380, to, 420, degrees, fahrenheit, is, normally, recommended, for, optimal, color, the, result, of, the, sublimation, process, is, a, nearly, permanent, high, resolution, full, color, print, because, the, dyes, are, infused, into, the, substrate, at, the, molecular, level, rather, than, applied, at, a, topical, level, such, as, with, screen, printing, and, direct, to, garment, printing, the, prints, will, not, crack, fade, or, peel, from, the, substrate, under, normal, conditions
