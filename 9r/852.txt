in, physics, refraction, is, the, redirection, of, a, wave, as, it, passes, from, one, medium, to, another, the, redirection, can, be, caused, by, the, wave, s, change, in, speed, or, by, a, change, in, the, medium, refraction, of, light, is, the, most, commonly, observed, phenomenon, but, other, waves, such, as, sound, waves, and, water, waves, also, experience, refraction, how, much, a, wave, is, refracted, is, determined, by, the, change, in, wave, speed, and, the, initial, direction, of, wave, propagation, relative, to, the, direction, of, change, in, speed, for, light, refraction, follows, snell, s, law, which, states, that, for, a, given, pair, of, media, the, ratio, of, the, sines, of, the, angle, of, incidence, 1, displaystyle, theta, 1, and, angle, of, refraction, 2, displaystyle, theta, 2, is, equal, to, the, ratio, of, phase, velocities, v, 1, v, 2, textstyle, frac, v, 1, v, 2, in, the, two, media, or, equivalently, to, the, refractive, indices, n, 2, n, 1, textstyle, frac, n, 2, n, 1, of, the, two, media, sin, 1, sin, 2, v, 1, v, 2, n, 2, n, 1, displaystyle, frac, sin, theta, 1, sin, theta, 2, frac, v, 1, v, 2, frac, n, 2, n, 1, optical, prisms, and, lenses, use, refraction, to, redirect, light, as, does, the, human, eye, the, refractive, index, of, materials, varies, with, the, wavelength, of, light, and, thus, the, angle, of, the, refraction, also, varies, correspondingly, this, is, called, dispersion, and, causes, prisms, and, rainbows, to, divide, white, light, into, its, constituent, spectral, colors, a, correct, explanation, of, refraction, involves, two, separate, parts, both, a, result, of, the, wave, nature, of, light, as, described, above, the, speed, of, light, is, slower, in, a, medium, other, than, vacuum, this, slowing, applies, to, any, medium, such, as, air, water, or, glass, and, is, responsible, for, phenomena, such, as, refraction, when, light, leaves, the, medium, and, returns, to, a, vacuum, and, ignoring, any, effects, of, gravity, its, speed, returns, to, the, usual, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, common, explanations, for, this, slowing, based, upon, the, idea, of, light, scattering, from, or, being, absorbed, and, re, emitted, by, atoms, are, both, incorrect, explanations, like, these, would, cause, a, blurring, effect, in, the, resulting, light, as, it, would, no, longer, be, travelling, in, just, one, direction, but, this, effect, is, not, seen, in, nature, a, correct, explanation, rests, on, light, s, nature, as, an, electromagnetic, wave, because, light, is, an, oscillating, electrical, magnetic, wave, light, traveling, in, a, medium, causes, the, electrically, charged, electrons, of, the, material, to, also, oscillate, the, material, s, protons, also, oscillate, but, as, they, are, around, 2000, times, more, massive, their, movement, and, therefore, their, effect, is, far, smaller, a, moving, electrical, charge, emits, electromagnetic, waves, of, its, own, the, electromagnetic, waves, emitted, by, the, oscillating, electrons, interact, with, the, electromagnetic, waves, that, make, up, the, original, light, similar, to, water, waves, on, a, pond, a, process, known, as, constructive, interference, when, two, waves, interfere, in, this, way, the, resulting, combined, wave, may, have, wave, packets, that, pass, an, observer, at, a, slower, rate, the, light, has, effectively, been, slowed, when, the, light, leaves, the, material, this, interaction, with, electrons, no, longer, happens, and, therefore, the, wave, packet, rate, and, therefore, its, speed, return, to, normal, consider, a, wave, going, from, one, material, to, another, where, its, speed, is, slower, as, in, the, figure, if, it, reaches, the, interface, between, the, materials, at, an, angle, one, side, of, the, wave, will, reach, the, second, material, first, and, therefore, slow, down, earlier, with, one, side, of, the, wave, going, slower, the, whole, wave, will, pivot, towards, that, side, this, is, why, a, wave, will, bend, away, from, the, surface, or, toward, the, normal, when, going, into, a, slower, material, in, the, opposite, case, of, a, wave, reaching, a, material, where, the, speed, is, higher, one, side, of, the, wave, will, speed, up, and, the, wave, will, pivot, away, from, that, side, another, way, of, understanding, the, same, thing, is, to, consider, the, change, in, wavelength, at, the, interface, when, the, wave, goes, from, one, material, to, another, where, the, wave, has, a, different, speed, v, the, frequency, f, of, the, wave, will, stay, the, same, but, the, distance, between, wavefronts, or, wavelength, v, f, will, change, if, the, speed, is, decreased, such, as, in, the, figure, to, the, right, the, wavelength, will, also, decrease, with, an, angle, between, the, wave, fronts, and, the, interface, and, change, in, distance, between, the, wave, fronts, the, angle, must, change, over, the, interface, to, keep, the, wave, fronts, intact, from, these, considerations, the, relationship, between, the, angle, of, incidence, 1, angle, of, transmission, 2, and, the, wave, speeds, v, 1, and, v, 2, in, the, two, materials, can, be, derived, this, is, the, law, of, refraction, or, snell, s, law, and, can, be, written, as, sin, 1, sin, 2, v, 1, v, 2, displaystyle, frac, sin, theta, 1, sin, theta, 2, frac, v, 1, v, 2, the, phenomenon, of, refraction, can, in, a, more, fundamental, way, be, derived, from, the, 2, or, 3, dimensional, wave, equation, the, boundary, condition, at, the, interface, will, then, require, the, tangential, component, of, the, wave, vector, to, be, identical, on, the, two, sides, of, the, interface, since, the, magnitude, of, the, wave, vector, depend, on, the, wave, speed, this, requires, a, change, in, direction, of, the, wave, vector, the, relevant, wave, speed, in, the, discussion, above, is, the, phase, velocity, of, the, wave, this, is, typically, close, to, the, group, velocity, which, can, be, seen, as, the, truer, speed, of, a, wave, but, when, they, differ, it, is, important, to, use, the, phase, velocity, in, all, calculations, relating, to, refraction, a, wave, traveling, perpendicular, to, a, boundary, i, e, having, its, wavefronts, parallel, to, the, boundary, will, not, change, direction, even, if, the, speed, of, the, wave, changes, refraction, is, also, responsible, for, rainbows, and, for, the, splitting, of, white, light, into, a, rainbow, spectrum, as, it, passes, through, a, glass, prism, glass, and, water, have, higher, refractive, indexes, than, air, when, a, beam, of, white, light, passes, from, air, into, a, material, having, an, index, of, refraction, that, varies, with, frequency, and, wavelength, a, phenomenon, known, as, dispersion, occurs, in, which, different, coloured, components, of, the, white, light, are, refracted, at, different, angles, i, e, they, bend, by, different, amounts, at, the, interface, so, that, they, become, separated, the, different, colors, correspond, to, different, frequencies, and, different, wavelengths, for, light, the, refractive, index, n, of, a, material, is, more, often, used, than, the, wave, phase, speed, v, in, the, material, they, are, directly, related, through, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, as, n, c, v, displaystyle, n, frac, c, v, in, optics, therefore, the, law, of, refraction, is, typically, written, as, n, 1, sin, 1, n, 2, sin, 2, displaystyle, n, 1, sin, theta, 1, n, 2, sin, theta, 2, refraction, occurs, when, light, goes, through, a, water, surface, since, water, has, a, refractive, index, of, 1, 33, and, air, has, a, refractive, index, of, about, 1, looking, at, a, straight, object, such, as, a, pencil, in, the, figure, here, which, is, placed, at, a, slant, partially, in, the, water, the, object, appears, to, bend, at, the, water, s, surface, this, is, due, to, the, bending, of, light, rays, as, they, move, from, the, water, to, the, air, once, the, rays, reach, the, eye, the, eye, traces, them, back, as, straight, lines, lines, of, sight, the, lines, of, sight, shown, as, dashed, lines, intersect, at, a, higher, position, than, where, the, actual, rays, originated, this, causes, the, pencil, to, appear, higher, and, the, water, to, appear, shallower, than, it, really, is, the, depth, that, the, water, appears, to, be, when, viewed, from, above, is, known, as, the, apparent, depth, this, is, an, important, consideration, for, spearfishing, from, the, surface, because, it, will, make, the, target, fish, appear, to, be, in, a, different, place, and, the, fisher, must, aim, lower, to, catch, the, fish, conversely, an, object, above, the, water, has, a, higher, apparent, height, when, viewed, from, below, the, water, the, opposite, correction, must, be, made, by, an, archer, fish, for, small, angles, of, incidence, measured, from, the, normal, when, sin, is, approximately, the, same, as, tan, the, ratio, of, apparent, to, real, depth, is, the, ratio, of, the, refractive, indexes, of, air, to, that, of, water, but, as, the, angle, of, incidence, approaches, 90, the, apparent, depth, approaches, zero, albeit, reflection, increases, which, limits, observation, at, high, angles, of, incidence, conversely, the, apparent, height, approaches, infinity, as, the, angle, of, incidence, from, below, increases, but, even, earlier, as, the, angle, of, total, internal, reflection, is, approached, albeit, the, image, also, fades, from, view, as, this, limit, is, approached, the, refractive, index, of, air, depends, on, the, air, density, and, thus, vary, with, air, temperature, and, pressure, since, the, pressure, is, lower, at, higher, altitudes, the, refractive, index, is, also, lower, causing, light, rays, to, refract, towards, the, earth, surface, when, traveling, long, distances, through, the, atmosphere, this, shifts, the, apparent, positions, of, stars, slightly, when, they, are, close, to, the, horizon, and, makes, the, sun, visible, before, it, geometrically, rises, above, the, horizon, during, a, sunrise, temperature, variations, in, the, air, can, also, cause, refraction, of, light, this, can, be, seen, as, a, heat, haze, when, hot, and, cold, air, is, mixed, e, g, over, a, fire, in, engine, exhaust, or, when, opening, a, window, on, a, cold, day, this, makes, objects, viewed, through, the, mixed, air, appear, to, shimmer, or, move, around, randomly, as, the, hot, and, cold, air, moves, this, effect, is, also, visible, from, normal, variations, in, air, temperature, during, a, sunny, day, when, using, high, magnification, telephoto, lenses, and, is, often, limiting, the, image, quality, in, these, cases, in, a, similar, way, atmospheric, turbulence, gives, rapidly, varying, distortions, in, the, images, of, astronomical, telescopes, limiting, the, resolution, of, terrestrial, telescopes, not, using, adaptive, optics, or, other, techniques, for, overcoming, these, atmospheric, distortions, air, temperature, variations, close, to, the, surface, can, give, rise, to, other, optical, phenomena, such, as, mirages, and, fata, morgana, most, commonly, air, heated, by, a, hot, road, on, a, sunny, day, deflects, light, approaching, at, a, shallow, angle, towards, a, viewer, this, makes, the, road, appear, reflecting, giving, an, illusion, of, water, covering, the, road, in, medicine, particularly, optometry, ophthalmology, and, orthoptics, refraction, also, known, as, refractometry, is, a, clinical, test, in, which, a, phoropter, may, be, used, by, the, appropriate, eye, care, professional, to, determine, the, eye, s, refractive, error, and, the, best, corrective, lenses, to, be, prescribed, a, series, of, test, lenses, in, graded, optical, powers, or, focal, lengths, are, presented, to, determine, which, provides, the, sharpest, clearest, vision, refractive, surgery, is, a, medical, procedure, to, treat, common, vision, disorders, water, waves, travel, slower, in, shallower, water, this, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, refraction, in, ripple, tanks, and, also, explains, why, waves, on, a, shoreline, tend, to, strike, the, shore, close, to, a, perpendicular, angle, as, the, waves, travel, from, deep, water, into, shallower, water, near, the, shore, they, are, refracted, from, their, original, direction, of, travel, to, an, angle, more, normal, to, the, shoreline, in, underwater, acoustics, refraction, is, the, bending, or, curving, of, a, sound, ray, that, results, when, the, ray, passes, through, a, sound, speed, gradient, from, a, region, of, one, sound, speed, to, a, region, of, a, different, speed, the, amount, of, ray, bending, is, dependent, on, the, amount, of, difference, between, sound, speeds, that, is, the, variation, in, temperature, salinity, and, pressure, of, the, water, similar, acoustics, effects, are, also, found, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, phenomenon, of, refraction, of, sound, in, the, atmosphere, has, been, known, for, centuries, beginning, in, the, early, 1970s, widespread, analysis, of, this, effect, came, into, vogue, through, the, designing, of, urban, highways, and, noise, barriers, to, address, the, meteorological, effects, of, bending, of, sound, rays, in, the, lower, atmosphere
