gallium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, the, symbol, ga, and, atomic, number, 31, discovered, by, the, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, in, 1875, gallium, is, in, group, 13, of, the, periodic, table, and, is, similar, to, the, other, metals, of, the, group, aluminium, indium, and, thallium, elemental, gallium, is, a, relatively, soft, silvery, metal, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, in, its, liquid, state, it, becomes, silvery, white, if, enough, force, is, applied, solid, gallium, may, fracture, conchoidally, since, its, discovery, in, 1875, gallium, has, widely, been, used, to, make, alloys, with, low, melting, points, it, is, also, used, in, semiconductors, as, a, dopant, in, semiconductor, substrates, the, melting, point, of, gallium, 29, 7646, c, 85, 5763, f, 302, 9146, k, is, used, as, a, temperature, reference, point, gallium, alloys, are, used, in, thermometers, as, a, non, toxic, and, environmentally, friendly, alternative, to, mercury, and, can, withstand, higher, temperatures, than, mercury, a, melting, point, of, 19, c, 2, f, well, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, is, claimed, for, the, alloy, galinstan, 62, 95, gallium, 5, 22, indium, and, 0, 16, tin, by, weight, but, that, may, be, the, freezing, point, with, the, effect, of, supercooling, gallium, does, not, occur, as, a, free, element, in, nature, but, rather, as, gallium, iii, compounds, in, trace, amounts, in, zinc, ores, such, as, sphalerite, and, in, bauxite, elemental, gallium, is, a, liquid, at, temperatures, greater, than, 29, 76, c, 85, 57, f, and, will, melt, in, a, person, s, hands, at, normal, human, body, temperature, of, 37, 0, c, 98, 6, f, gallium, is, predominantly, used, in, electronics, gallium, arsenide, the, primary, chemical, compound, of, gallium, in, electronics, is, used, in, microwave, circuits, high, speed, switching, circuits, and, infrared, circuits, semiconducting, gallium, nitride, and, indium, gallium, nitride, produce, blue, and, violet, light, emitting, diodes, and, diode, lasers, gallium, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, artificial, gadolinium, gallium, garnet, for, jewelry, gallium, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, by, the, united, states, national, library, of, medicine, and, frontiers, media, gallium, has, no, known, natural, role, in, biology, gallium, iii, behaves, in, a, similar, manner, to, ferric, salts, in, biological, systems, and, has, been, used, in, some, medical, applications, including, pharmaceuticals, and, radiopharmaceuticals, elemental, gallium, is, not, found, in, nature, but, it, is, easily, obtained, by, smelting, very, pure, gallium, is, a, silvery, blue, metal, that, fractures, conchoidally, like, glass, gallium, s, volume, expands, by, 3, 10, when, it, changes, from, a, liquid, to, a, solid, so, care, must, be, taken, when, storing, it, in, containers, that, may, rupture, when, it, changes, state, gallium, shares, the, higher, density, liquid, state, with, a, short, list, of, other, materials, that, includes, water, silicon, germanium, bismuth, and, plutonium, gallium, forms, alloys, with, most, metals, it, readily, diffuses, into, cracks, or, grain, boundaries, of, some, metals, such, as, aluminium, aluminium, zinc, alloys, and, steel, causing, extreme, loss, of, strength, and, ductility, called, liquid, metal, embrittlement, the, melting, point, of, gallium, at, 302, 9146, k, 29, 7646, c, 85, 5763, f, is, just, above, room, temperature, and, is, approximately, the, same, as, the, average, summer, daytime, temperatures, in, earth, s, mid, latitudes, this, melting, point, mp, is, one, of, the, formal, temperature, reference, points, in, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, its, 90, established, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, the, triple, point, of, gallium, 302, 9166, k, 29, 7666, c, 85, 5799, f, is, used, by, the, us, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, in, preference, to, the, melting, point, the, melting, point, of, gallium, allows, it, to, melt, in, the, human, hand, and, then, solidify, if, removed, the, liquid, metal, has, a, strong, tendency, to, supercool, below, its, melting, point, freezing, point, ga, nanoparticles, can, be, kept, in, the, liquid, state, below, 90, k, seeding, with, a, crystal, helps, to, initiate, freezing, gallium, is, one, of, the, four, non, radioactive, metals, with, caesium, rubidium, and, mercury, that, are, known, to, be, liquid, at, or, near, normal, room, temperature, of, the, four, gallium, is, the, only, one, that, is, neither, highly, reactive, as, are, rubidium, and, caesium, nor, highly, toxic, as, is, mercury, and, can, therefore, be, used, in, metal, in, glass, high, temperature, thermometers, it, is, also, notable, for, having, one, of, the, largest, liquid, ranges, for, a, metal, and, for, having, unlike, mercury, a, low, vapor, pressure, at, high, temperatures, gallium, s, boiling, point, 2676, k, is, nearly, nine, times, higher, than, its, melting, point, on, the, absolute, scale, the, greatest, ratio, between, melting, point, and, boiling, point, of, any, element, unlike, mercury, liquid, gallium, metal, wets, glass, and, skin, along, with, most, other, materials, with, the, exceptions, of, quartz, graphite, gallium, iii, oxide, and, ptfe, making, it, mechanically, more, difficult, to, handle, even, though, it, is, substantially, less, toxic, and, requires, far, fewer, precautions, than, mercury, gallium, painted, onto, glass, is, a, brilliant, mirror, for, this, reason, as, well, as, the, metal, contamination, and, freezing, expansion, problems, samples, of, gallium, metal, are, usually, supplied, in, polyethylene, packets, within, other, containers, gallium, does, not, crystallize, in, any, of, the, simple, crystal, structures, the, stable, phase, under, normal, conditions, is, orthorhombic, with, 8, atoms, in, the, conventional, unit, cell, within, a, unit, cell, each, atom, has, only, one, nearest, neighbor, at, a, distance, of, 244, pm, the, remaining, six, unit, cell, neighbors, are, spaced, 27, 30, and, 39, pm, farther, away, and, they, are, grouped, in, pairs, with, the, same, distance, many, stable, and, metastable, phases, are, found, as, function, of, temperature, and, pressure, the, bonding, between, the, two, nearest, neighbors, is, covalent, hence, ga, 2, dimers, are, seen, as, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, the, crystal, this, explains, the, low, melting, point, relative, to, the, neighbor, elements, aluminium, and, indium, this, structure, is, strikingly, similar, to, that, of, iodine, and, may, form, because, of, interactions, between, the, single, 4p, electrons, of, gallium, atoms, further, away, from, the, nucleus, than, the, 4s, electrons, and, the, 3d, 10, core, this, phenomenon, recurs, with, mercury, with, its, pseudo, noble, gas, 4f, 14, 5d, 10, 6s, 2, electron, configuration, which, is, liquid, at, room, temperature, the, 3d, 10, electrons, do, not, shield, the, outer, electrons, very, well, from, the, nucleus, and, hence, the, first, ionisation, energy, of, gallium, is, greater, than, that, of, aluminium, ga, 2, dimers, do, not, persist, in, the, liquid, state, and, liquid, gallium, exhibits, a, complex, low, coordinated, structure, in, which, each, gallium, atom, is, surrounded, by, 10, others, rather, than, 11, 12, neighbors, typical, of, most, liquid, metals, the, physical, properties, of, gallium, are, highly, anisotropic, i, e, have, different, values, along, the, three, major, crystallographic, axes, a, b, and, c, see, table, producing, a, significant, difference, between, the, linear, and, volume, thermal, expansion, coefficients, the, properties, of, gallium, are, strongly, temperature, dependent, particularly, near, the, melting, point, for, example, the, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, increases, by, several, hundred, percent, upon, melting, gallium, has, 30, known, isotopes, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 60, to, 89, only, two, isotopes, are, stable, and, occur, naturally, gallium, 69, and, gallium, 71, gallium, 69, is, more, abundant, it, makes, up, about, 60, 1, of, natural, gallium, while, gallium, 71, makes, up, the, remaining, 39, 9, all, the, other, isotopes, are, radioactive, with, gallium, 67, being, the, longest, lived, half, life, 3, 261, days, isotopes, lighter, than, gallium, 69, usually, decay, through, beta, plus, decay, positron, emission, or, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, zinc, while, isotopes, heavier, than, gallium, 71, decay, through, beta, minus, decay, electron, emission, possibly, with, delayed, neutron, emission, to, isotopes, of, germanium, gallium, 70, can, decay, through, both, beta, minus, decay, and, electron, capture, gallium, 67, is, unique, among, the, light, isotopes, in, having, only, electron, capture, as, a, decay, mode, as, its, decay, energy, is, not, sufficient, to, allow, positron, emission, gallium, 67, and, gallium, 68, half, life, 67, 7, min, are, both, used, in, nuclear, medicine, gallium, is, found, primarily, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, the, 1, oxidation, state, is, also, found, in, some, compounds, although, it, is, less, common, than, it, is, for, gallium, s, heavier, congeners, indium, and, thallium, for, example, the, very, stable, gacl, 2, contains, both, gallium, i, and, gallium, iii, and, can, be, formulated, as, ga, i, ga, iii, cl, 4, in, contrast, the, monochloride, is, unstable, above, 0, c, disproportionating, into, elemental, gallium, and, gallium, iii, chloride, compounds, containing, ga, ga, bonds, are, true, gallium, ii, compounds, such, as, gas, which, can, be, formulated, as, ga, 2, 4, s, 2, 2, and, the, dioxan, complex, ga, 2, cl, 4, c, 4, h, 8, o, 2, 2, strong, acids, dissolve, gallium, forming, gallium, iii, salts, such, as, ga, no, 3, 3, gallium, nitrate, aqueous, solutions, of, gallium, iii, salts, contain, the, hydrated, gallium, ion, 3, 1033, gallium, iii, hydroxide, ga, oh, 3, may, be, precipitated, from, gallium, iii, solutions, by, adding, ammonia, dehydrating, ga, oh, 3, at, 100, c, produces, gallium, oxide, hydroxide, gao, oh, 140, 141, alkaline, hydroxide, solutions, dissolve, gallium, forming, gallate, salts, not, to, be, confused, with, identically, named, gallic, acid, salts, containing, the, ga, oh, 4, anion, 1033, gallium, hydroxide, which, is, amphoteric, also, dissolves, in, alkali, to, form, gallate, salts, 141, although, earlier, work, suggested, ga, oh, 3, 6, as, another, possible, gallate, anion, it, was, not, found, in, later, work, gallium, reacts, with, the, chalcogens, only, at, relatively, high, temperatures, at, room, temperature, gallium, metal, is, not, reactive, with, air, and, water, because, it, forms, a, passive, protective, oxide, layer, at, higher, temperatures, however, it, reacts, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, form, gallium, iii, oxide, ga, 2, o, 3, reducing, ga, 2, o, 3, with, elemental, gallium, in, vacuum, at, 500, c, to, 700, c, yields, the, dark, brown, gallium, i, oxide, ga, 2, o, 285, ga, 2, o, is, a, very, strong, reducing, agent, capable, of, reducing, h, 2, so, 4, to, h, 2, s, 207, it, disproportionates, at, 800, c, back, to, gallium, and, ga, 2, o, 3, gallium, iii, sulfide, ga, 2, s, 3, has, 3, possible, crystal, modifications, 104, it, can, be, made, by, the, reaction, of, gallium, with, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, at, 950, c, 162, alternatively, ga, oh, 3, can, be, used, at, 747, c, reacting, a, mixture, of, alkali, metal, carbonates, and, ga, 2, o, 3, with, h, 2, s, leads, to, the, formation, of, thiogallates, containing, the, 2, anion, strong, acids, decompose, these, salts, releasing, h, 2, s, in, the, process, 104, 105, the, mercury, salt, hgga, 2, s, 4, can, be, used, as, a, phosphor, gallium, also, forms, sulfides, in, lower, oxidation, states, such, as, gallium, ii, sulfide, and, the, green, gallium, i, sulfide, the, latter, of, which, is, produced, from, the, former, by, heating, to, 1000, c, under, a, stream, of, nitrogen, 94, the, other, binary, chalcogenides, ga, 2, se, 3, and, ga, 2, te, 3, have, the, zincblende, structure, they, are, all, semiconductors, but, are, easily, hydrolysed, and, have, limited, utility, 104, gallium, reacts, with, ammonia, at, 1050, c, to, form, gallium, nitride, gan, gallium, also, forms, binary, compounds, with, phosphorus, arsenic, and, antimony, gallium, phosphide, gap, gallium, arsenide, gaas, and, gallium, antimonide, gasb, these, compounds, have, the, same, structure, as, zns, and, have, important, semiconducting, properties, 1034, gap, gaas, and, gasb, can, be, synthesized, by, the, direct, reaction, of, gallium, with, elemental, phosphorus, arsenic, or, antimony, 99, they, exhibit, higher, electrical, conductivity, than, gan, 101, gap, can, also, be, synthesized, by, reacting, ga, 2, o, with, phosphorus, at, low, temperatures, gallium, forms, ternary, nitrides, for, example, 99, similar, compounds, with, phosphorus, and, arsenic, are, possible, li, 3, gap, 2, and, li, 3, gaas, 2, these, compounds, are, easily, hydrolyzed, by, dilute, acids, and, water, 101, gallium, iii, oxide, reacts, with, fluorinating, agents, such, as, hf, or, f, 2, to, form, gallium, iii, fluoride, gaf, 3, it, is, an, ionic, compound, strongly, insoluble, in, water, however, it, dissolves, in, hydrofluoric, acid, in, which, it, forms, an, adduct, with, water, gaf, 3, 3h, 2, o, attempting, to, dehydrate, this, adduct, forms, gaf, 2, oh, n, h, 2, o, the, adduct, reacts, with, ammonia, to, form, gaf, 3, 3nh, 3, which, can, then, be, heated, to, form, anhydrous, gaf, 3, 128, 129, gallium, trichloride, is, formed, by, the, reaction, of, gallium, metal, with, chlorine, gas, unlike, the, trifluoride, gallium, iii, chloride, exists, as, dimeric, molecules, ga, 2, cl, 6, with, a, melting, point, of, 78, c, eqivalent, compounds, are, formed, with, bromine, and, iodine, ga, 2, br, 6, and, ga, 2, i, 6, 133, like, the, other, group, 13, trihalides, gallium, iii, halides, are, lewis, acids, reacting, as, halide, acceptors, with, alkali, metal, halides, to, form, salts, containing, gax, 4, anions, where, x, is, a, halogen, they, also, react, with, alkyl, halides, to, form, carbocations, and, gax, 4, 136, 137, when, heated, to, a, high, temperature, gallium, iii, halides, react, with, elemental, gallium, to, form, the, respective, gallium, i, halides, for, example, gacl, 3, reacts, with, ga, to, form, gacl, at, lower, temperatures, the, equilibrium, shifts, toward, the, left, and, gacl, disproportionates, back, to, elemental, gallium, and, gacl, 3, gacl, can, also, be, produced, by, reacting, ga, with, hcl, at, 950, c, the, product, can, be, condensed, as, a, red, solid, 1036, gallium, i, compounds, can, be, stabilized, by, forming, adducts, with, lewis, acids, for, example, the, so, called, gallium, ii, halides, gax, 2, are, actually, adducts, of, gallium, i, halides, with, the, respective, gallium, iii, halides, having, the, structure, ga, for, example, 1036, like, aluminium, gallium, also, forms, a, hydride, gah, 3, known, as, gallane, which, may, be, produced, by, reacting, lithium, gallanate, ligah, 4, with, gallium, iii, chloride, at, 30, c, 1031, in, the, presence, of, dimethyl, ether, as, solvent, gah, 3, polymerizes, to, gah, 3, n, if, no, solvent, is, used, the, dimer, ga, 2, h, 6, digallane, is, formed, as, a, gas, its, structure, is, similar, to, diborane, having, two, hydrogen, atoms, bridging, the, two, gallium, centers, 1031, unlike, alh, 3, in, which, aluminium, has, a, coordination, number, of, 6, 1008, gallane, is, unstable, above, 10, c, decomposing, to, elemental, gallium, and, hydrogen, organogallium, compounds, are, of, similar, reactivity, to, organoindium, compounds, less, reactive, than, organoaluminium, compounds, but, more, reactive, than, organothallium, compounds, alkylgalliums, are, monomeric, lewis, acidity, decreases, in, the, order, al, ga, in, and, as, a, result, organogallium, compounds, do, not, form, bridged, dimers, as, organoaluminium, compounds, do, organogallium, compounds, are, also, less, reactive, than, organoaluminium, compounds, they, do, form, stable, peroxides, these, alkylgalliums, are, liquids, at, room, temperature, having, low, melting, points, and, are, quite, mobile, and, flammable, triphenylgallium, is, monomeric, in, solution, but, its, crystals, form, chain, structures, due, to, weak, intermolecluar, ga, c, interactions, gallium, trichloride, is, a, common, starting, reagent, for, the, formation, of, organogallium, compounds, such, as, in, carbogallation, reactions, gallium, trichloride, reacts, with, lithium, cyclopentadienide, in, diethyl, ether, to, form, the, trigonal, planar, gallium, cyclopentadienyl, complex, gacp, 3, gallium, i, forms, complexes, with, arene, ligands, such, as, hexamethylbenzene, because, this, ligand, is, quite, bulky, the, structure, of, the, is, that, of, a, half, sandwich, less, bulky, ligands, such, as, mesitylene, allow, two, ligands, to, be, attached, to, the, central, gallium, atom, in, a, bent, sandwich, structure, benzene, is, even, less, bulky, and, allows, the, formation, of, dimers, an, example, is, 3c, 6, h, 6, in, 1871, the, existence, of, gallium, was, first, predicted, by, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleev, who, named, it, eka, aluminium, from, its, position, in, his, periodic, table, he, also, predicted, several, properties, of, eka, aluminium, that, correspond, closely, to, the, real, properties, of, gallium, such, as, its, density, melting, point, oxide, character, and, bonding, in, chloride, mendeleev, further, predicted, that, eka, aluminium, would, be, discovered, by, means, of, the, spectroscope, and, that, metallic, eka, aluminium, would, dissolve, slowly, in, both, acids, and, alkalis, and, would, not, react, with, air, he, also, predicted, that, m, 2, o, 3, would, dissolve, in, acids, to, give, mx, 3, salts, that, eka, aluminium, salts, would, form, basic, salts, that, eka, aluminium, sulfate, should, form, alums, and, that, anhydrous, mcl, 3, should, have, a, greater, volatility, than, zncl, 2, all, of, these, predictions, turned, out, to, be, true, gallium, was, discovered, using, spectroscopy, by, french, chemist, paul, emile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, in, 1875, from, its, characteristic, spectrum, two, violet, lines, in, a, sample, of, sphalerite, later, that, year, lecoq, obtained, the, free, metal, by, electrolysis, of, the, hydroxide, in, potassium, hydroxide, solution, he, named, the, element, gallia, from, latin, gallia, meaning, gaul, after, his, native, land, of, france, it, was, later, claimed, that, in, a, multilingual, pun, of, a, kind, favoured, by, men, of, science, in, the, 19th, century, he, had, also, named, gallium, after, himself, le, coq, is, french, for, the, rooster, and, the, latin, word, for, rooster, is, gallus, in, an, 1877, article, lecoq, denied, this, conjecture, originally, de, boisbaudran, determined, the, density, of, gallium, as, 4, 7, g, cm, 3, the, only, property, that, failed, to, match, mendeleev, s, predictions, mendeleev, then, wrote, to, him, and, suggested, that, he, should, remeasure, the, density, and, de, boisbaudran, then, obtained, the, correct, value, of, 5, 9, g, cm, 3, that, mendeleev, had, predicted, exactly, from, its, discovery, in, 1875, until, the, era, of, semiconductors, the, primary, uses, of, gallium, were, high, temperature, thermometrics, and, metal, alloys, with, unusual, properties, of, stability, or, ease, of, melting, some, such, being, liquid, at, room, temperature, the, development, of, gallium, arsenide, as, a, direct, bandgap, semiconductor, in, the, 1960s, ushered, in, the, most, important, stage, in, the, applications, of, gallium, in, the, late, 1960s, the, electronics, industry, started, using, gallium, on, a, commercial, scale, to, fabricate, light, emitting, diodes, photovoltaics, and, semiconductors, while, the, metals, industry, used, it, to, reduce, the, melting, point, of, alloys, gallium, does, not, exist, as, a, free, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, few, high, content, minerals, such, as, gallite, cugas, 2, are, too, rare, to, serve, as, a, primary, source, the, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, approximately, 16, 9, ppm, it, is, the, 34th, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, this, is, comparable, to, the, crustal, abundances, of, lead, cobalt, and, niobium, yet, unlike, these, elements, gallium, does, not, form, its, own, ore, deposits, with, concentrations, of, 0, 1, wt, in, ore, rather, it, occurs, at, trace, concentrations, similar, to, the, crustal, value, in, zinc, ores, and, at, somewhat, higher, values, 50, ppm, in, aluminium, ores, from, both, of, which, it, is, extracted, as, a, by, product, this, lack, of, independent, deposits, is, due, to, gallium, s, geochemical, behaviour, showing, no, strong, enrichment, in, the, processes, relevant, to, the, formation, of, most, ore, deposits, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, estimates, that, more, than, 1, million, tons, of, gallium, is, contained, in, known, reserves, of, bauxite, and, zinc, ores, some, coal, flue, dusts, contain, small, quantities, of, gallium, typically, less, than, 1, by, weight, however, these, amounts, are, not, extractable, without, mining, of, the, host, materials, see, below, thus, the, availability, of, gallium, is, fundamentally, determined, by, the, rate, at, which, bauxite, zinc, ores, and, coal, are, extracted, gallium, is, produced, exclusively, as, a, by, product, during, the, processing, of, the, ores, of, other, metals, its, main, source, material, is, bauxite, the, chief, ore, of, aluminium, but, minor, amounts, are, also, extracted, from, sulfidic, zinc, ores, sphalerite, being, the, main, host, mineral, in, the, past, certain, coals, were, an, important, source, during, the, processing, of, bauxite, to, alumina, in, the, bayer, process, gallium, accumulates, in, the, sodium, hydroxide, liquor, from, this, it, can, be, extracted, by, a, variety, of, methods, the, most, recent, is, the, use, of, ion, exchange, resin, achievable, extraction, efficiencies, critically, depend, on, the, original, concentration, in, the, feed, bauxite, at, a, typical, feed, concentration, of, 50, ppm, about, 15, of, the, contained, gallium, is, extractable, the, remainder, reports, to, the, red, mud, and, aluminium, hydroxide, streams, gallium, is, removed, from, the, ion, exchange, resin, in, solution, electrolysis, then, gives, gallium, metal, for, semiconductor, use, it, is, further, purified, with, zone, melting, or, single, crystal, extraction, from, a, melt, czochralski, process, purities, of, 99, 9999, are, routinely, achieved, and, commercially, available, its, by, product, status, means, that, gallium, production, is, constrained, by, the, amount, of, bauxite, sulfidic, zinc, ores, and, coal, extracted, per, year, therefore, its, availability, needs, to, be, discussed, in, terms, of, supply, potential, the, supply, potential, of, a, by, product, is, defined, as, that, amount, which, is, economically, extractable, from, its, host, materials, per, year, under, current, market, conditions, i, e, technology, and, price, reserves, and, resources, are, not, relevant, for, by, products, since, they, cannot, be, extracted, independently, from, the, main, products, recent, estimates, put, the, supply, potential, of, gallium, at, a, minimum, of, 2, 100, t, yr, from, bauxite, 85, t, yr, from, sulfidic, zinc, ores, and, potentially, 590, t, yr, from, coal, these, figures, are, significantly, greater, than, current, production, 375, t, in, 2016, thus, major, future, increases, in, the,

in, glide, wax, for, skis, and, other, low, friction, surface, materials, flexible, electronics, materials, scientists, speculate, that, the, properties, of, gallium, could, make, it, suitable, for, the, development, of, flexible, and, wearable, devices, hydrogen, generation, gallium, disrupts, the, protective, oxide, layer, on, aluminium, allowing, water, to, react, with, the, aluminium, in, alga, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, humor, a, well, known, practical, joke, among, chemists, is, to, fashion, gallium, spoons, and, use, them, to, serve, tea, to, unsuspecting, guests, since, gallium, has, a, similar, appearance, to, its, lighter, homolog, aluminium, the, spoons, then, melt, in, the, hot, tea, advances, in, trace, element, testing, have, allowed, scientists, to, discover, traces, of, dissolved, gallium, in, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, in, recent, years, dissolved, gallium, concentrations, have, presented, in, the, beaufort, sea, these, reports, reflect, the, possible, profiles, of, the, pacific, and, atlantic, ocean, waters, for, the, pacific, oceans, typical, dissolved, gallium, concentrations, are, between, 4, and, 6, pmol, kg, at, depths, 150, m, in, comparison, for, atlantic, waters, 25, 28, pmol, kg, at, depths, 350, m, gallium, has, entered, oceans, mainly, through, aeolian, input, but, having, gallium, in, our, oceans, can, be, used, to, resolve, aluminium, distribution, in, the, oceans, the, reason, for, this, is, that, gallium, is, geochemically, similar, to, aluminium, just, less, reactive, gallium, also, has, a, slightly, larger, surface, water, residence, time, than, aluminium, gallium, has, a, similar, dissolved, profile, similar, to, that, of, aluminium, due, to, this, gallium, can, be, used, as, a, tracer, for, aluminium, gallium, can, also, be, used, as, a, tracer, of, aeolian, inputs, of, iron, gallium, is, used, as, a, tracer, for, iron, in, the, northwest, pacific, south, and, central, atlantic, oceans, for, example, in, the, northwest, pacific, low, gallium, surface, waters, in, the, subpolar, region, suggest, that, there, is, low, dust, input, which, can, subsequently, explain, the, following, high, nutrient, low, chlorophyll, environmental, behavior, metallic, gallium, is, not, toxic, however, several, gallium, compounds, are, toxic, gallium, halide, complexes, can, be, toxic, the, ga, 3, ion, of, soluble, gallium, salts, tends, to, form, the, insoluble, hydroxide, when, injected, in, large, doses, precipitation, of, this, hydroxide, resulted, in, nephrotoxicity, in, animals, in, lower, doses, soluble, gallium, is, tolerated, well, and, does, not, accumulate, as, a, poison, instead, being, excreted, mostly, through, urine, excretion, of, gallium, occurs, in, two, phases, the, first, phase, has, a, biological, half, life, of, 1, hour, while, the, second, has, a, biological, half, life, of, 25, hours, inhaled, ga, 2, o, 3, particles, are, probably, toxic
