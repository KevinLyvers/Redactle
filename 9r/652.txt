body, of, water, by, a, narrow, landform, such, as, reefs, barrier, islands, barrier, peninsulas, or, isthmuses, lagoons, are, commonly, divided, into, coastal, lagoons, or, barrier, lagoons, and, atoll, lagoons, they, have, also, been, identified, as, occurring, on, mixed, sand, and, gravel, coastlines, there, is, an, overlap, between, bodies, of, water, classified, as, coastal, lagoons, and, bodies, of, water, classified, as, estuaries, lagoons, are, common, coastal, features, around, many, parts, of, the, world, lagoons, are, shallow, often, elongated, bodies, of, water, separated, from, a, larger, body, of, water, by, a, shallow, or, exposed, shoal, coral, reef, or, similar, feature, some, authorities, include, fresh, water, bodies, in, the, definition, of, lagoon, while, others, explicitly, restrict, lagoon, to, bodies, of, water, with, some, degree, of, salinity, the, distinction, between, lagoon, and, estuary, also, varies, between, authorities, richard, a, davis, jr, restricts, lagoon, to, bodies, of, water, with, little, or, no, fresh, water, inflow, and, little, or, no, tidal, flow, and, calls, any, bay, that, receives, a, regular, flow, of, fresh, water, an, estuary, davis, does, state, that, the, terms, lagoon, and, estuary, are, often, loosely, applied, even, in, scientific, literature, timothy, m, kusky, characterizes, lagoons, as, normally, being, elongated, parallel, to, the, coast, while, estuaries, are, usually, drowned, river, valleys, elongated, perpendicular, to, the, coast, coastal, lagoons, are, classified, as, inland, bodies, of, water, when, used, within, the, context, of, a, distinctive, portion, of, coral, reef, ecosystems, the, term, lagoon, is, synonymous, with, the, term, back, reef, or, backreef, which, is, more, commonly, used, by, coral, reef, scientists, to, refer, to, the, same, area, many, lagoons, do, not, include, lagoon, in, their, common, names, currituck, albemarle, and, pamlico, sounds, in, north, carolina, great, south, bay, between, long, island, and, the, barrier, beaches, of, fire, island, in, new, york, isle, of, wight, bay, which, separates, ocean, city, maryland, from, the, rest, of, worcester, county, maryland, banana, river, in, florida, us, lake, illawarra, in, new, south, wales, australia, montrose, basin, in, scotland, and, broad, water, in, wales, have, all, been, classified, as, lagoons, despite, their, names, in, england, the, fleet, at, chesil, beach, has, also, been, described, as, a, lagoon, in, some, languages, the, word, for, a, lagoon, is, simply, a, type, of, lake, in, chinese, a, lake, is, hu, and, a, lagoon, is, xihu, in, the, french, mediterranean, several, lagoons, are, called, tang, lake, contrariwise, several, other, languages, have, specific, words, for, such, bodies, of, water, in, spanish, coastal, lagoons, generically, are, laguna, costera, but, those, on, the, mediterranean, coast, are, specifically, called, albufera, in, russian, and, ukrainian, those, on, the, black, sea, are, liman, while, the, generic, word, is, laguna, similarly, in, the, baltic, danish, has, the, specific, nor, and, german, the, specifics, bodden, and, haff, as, well, as, generic, terms, derived, from, laguna, in, poland, these, lagoons, are, called, zalew, bay, in, lithuania, marios, lagoon, reservoir, in, jutland, several, lagoons, are, known, as, fjord, in, new, zealand, the, m, ori, word, hapua, refers, to, a, coastal, lagoon, formed, at, the, mouth, of, a, braided, river, where, there, are, mixed, sand, and, gravel, beaches, while, waituna, an, ephemeral, coastal, waterbody, is, neither, a, true, lagoon, lake, nor, estuary, some, languages, differentiate, between, coastal, and, atoll, lagoons, in, french, lagon, refers, specifically, to, an, atoll, lagoon, while, coastal, lagoons, are, described, as, tang, the, generic, word, for, a, still, lake, or, pond, in, vietnamese, m, san, h, refers, to, an, atoll, lagoon, whilst, m, ph, is, coastal, in, latin, america, the, term, laguna, in, spanish, which, lagoon, translates, to, may, be, used, for, a, small, fresh, water, lake, in, a, similar, way, a, creek, is, considered, a, small, river, however, sometimes, it, is, popularly, used, to, describe, a, full, sized, lake, such, as, laguna, catemaco, in, mexico, which, is, actually, the, third, largest, lake, by, area, in, the, country, the, brackish, water, lagoon, may, be, thus, explicitly, identified, as, a, coastal, lagoon, laguna, costera, in, portuguese, a, similar, usage, is, found, lagoa, may, be, a, body, of, shallow, seawater, or, a, small, freshwater, lake, not, linked, to, the, sea, lagoon, is, derived, from, the, italian, laguna, which, refers, to, the, waters, around, venice, the, venetian, lagoon, laguna, is, attested, in, english, by, at, least, 1612, and, had, been, anglicized, to, lagune, by, 1673, in, 1697, william, dampier, referred, to, a, lagune, or, lake, of, salt, water, on, the, coast, of, mexico, captain, james, cook, described, an, island, of, oval, form, with, a, lagoon, in, the, middle, in, 1769, atoll, lagoons, form, as, coral, reefs, grow, upwards, while, the, islands, that, the, reefs, surround, subside, until, eventually, only, the, reefs, remain, above, sea, level, unlike, the, lagoons, that, form, shoreward, of, fringing, reefs, atoll, lagoons, often, contain, some, deep, 20, m, 66, ft, portions, coastal, lagoons, form, along, gently, sloping, coasts, where, barrier, islands, or, reefs, can, develop, offshore, and, the, sea, level, is, rising, relative, to, the, land, along, the, shore, either, because, of, an, intrinsic, rise, in, sea, level, or, subsidence, of, the, land, along, the, coast, coastal, lagoons, do, not, form, along, steep, or, rocky, coasts, or, if, the, range, of, tides, is, more, than, 4, metres, 13, ft, due, to, the, gentle, slope, of, the, coast, coastal, lagoons, are, shallow, a, relative, drop, in, sea, level, may, leave, a, lagoon, largely, dry, while, a, rise, in, sea, level, may, let, the, sea, breach, or, destroy, barrier, islands, and, leave, reefs, too, deep, underwater, to, protect, the, lagoon, coastal, lagoons, are, young, and, dynamic, and, may, be, short, lived, in, geological, terms, coastal, lagoons, are, common, occurring, along, nearly, 15, percent, of, the, world, s, shorelines, in, the, united, states, lagoons, are, found, along, more, than, 75, percent, of, the, eastern, and, gulf, coasts, coastal, lagoons, are, usually, connected, to, the, open, ocean, by, inlets, between, barrier, islands, the, number, and, size, of, the, inlets, precipitation, evaporation, and, inflow, of, fresh, water, all, affect, the, nature, of, the, lagoon, lagoons, with, little, or, no, interchange, with, the, open, ocean, little, or, no, inflow, of, fresh, water, and, high, evaporation, rates, such, as, lake, st, lucia, in, south, africa, may, become, highly, saline, lagoons, with, no, connection, to, the, open, ocean, and, significant, inflow, of, fresh, water, such, as, the, lake, worth, lagoon, in, florida, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, may, be, entirely, fresh, on, the, other, hand, lagoons, with, many, wide, inlets, such, as, the, wadden, sea, have, strong, tidal, currents, and, mixing, coastal, lagoons, tend, to, accumulate, sediments, from, inflowing, rivers, from, runoff, from, the, shores, of, the, lagoon, and, from, sediment, carried, into, the, lagoon, through, inlets, by, the, tide, large, quantities, of, sediment, may, be, occasionally, be, deposited, in, a, lagoon, when, storm, waves, overwash, barrier, islands, mangroves, and, marsh, plants, can, facilitate, the, accumulation, of, sediment, in, a, lagoon, benthic, organisms, may, stabilize, or, destabilize, sediments, lake, chilika, is, the, largest, brackish, water, lagoon, in, asia, and, the, second, largest, coastal, lagoon, in, the, world
