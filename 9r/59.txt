the, degree, celsius, is, the, unit, of, temperature, on, the, celsius, temperature, scale, originally, known, as, the, centigrade, scale, outside, sweden, one, of, two, temperature, scales, used, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, other, being, the, closely, related, kelvin, scale, the, degree, celsius, symbol, c, can, refer, to, a, specific, point, on, the, celsius, temperature, scale, or, to, a, difference, or, range, between, two, temperatures, it, is, named, after, the, swedish, astronomer, anders, celsius, 1701, 1744, who, proposed, the, first, version, of, it, in, 1742, the, unit, was, called, centigrade, in, several, languages, from, the, latin, centum, which, means, 100, and, gradus, which, means, steps, for, many, years, in, 1948, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, renamed, it, to, honor, celsius, and, also, to, remove, confusion, with, the, term, for, one, hundredth, of, a, gradian, in, some, languages, most, countries, use, this, scale, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, still, used, in, the, united, states, some, island, territories, and, liberia, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, scale, was, based, on, 0, c, for, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, 100, c, for, the, boiling, point, of, water, at, 1, atm, pressure, in, celsius, s, initial, proposal, the, values, were, reversed, the, boiling, point, was, 0, degrees, and, the, freezing, point, was, 100, degrees, between, 1954, and, 2019, the, precise, definitions, of, the, unit, degree, celsius, and, the, celsius, temperature, scale, used, absolute, zero, and, the, triple, point, of, water, since, 2007, the, celsius, temperature, scale, has, been, defined, in, terms, of, the, kelvin, the, si, base, unit, of, thermodynamic, temperature, symbol, k, absolute, zero, the, lowest, temperature, is, now, defined, as, being, exactly, 0, k, and, 273, 15, c, in, 1742, swedish, astronomer, anders, celsius, 1701, 1744, created, a, temperature, scale, that, was, the, reverse, of, the, scale, now, known, as, celsius, 0, represented, the, boiling, point, of, water, while, 100, represented, the, freezing, point, of, water, in, his, paper, observations, of, two, persistent, degrees, on, a, thermometer, he, recounted, his, experiments, showing, that, the, melting, point, of, ice, is, essentially, unaffected, by, pressure, he, also, determined, with, remarkable, precision, how, the, boiling, point, of, water, varied, as, a, function, of, atmospheric, pressure, he, proposed, that, the, zero, point, of, his, temperature, scale, being, the, boiling, point, would, be, calibrated, at, the, mean, barometric, pressure, at, mean, sea, level, this, pressure, is, known, as, one, standard, atmosphere, the, bipm, s, 10th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, in, 1954, defined, one, standard, atmosphere, to, equal, precisely, 1, 013, 250, dynes, per, square, centimeter, 101, 325, kpa, in, 1743, the, lyonnais, physicist, jean, pierre, christin, permanent, secretary, of, the, academy, of, lyon, inverted, the, celsius, temperature, scale, so, that, 0, represented, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, 100, represented, the, boiling, point, of, water, some, credit, christin, for, independently, inventing, the, reverse, of, celsius, s, original, scale, while, others, believe, christin, merely, reversed, celsius, s, scale, on, 19, may, 1743, he, published, the, design, of, a, mercury, thermometer, the, thermometer, of, lyon, built, by, the, craftsman, pierre, casati, that, used, this, scale, in, 1744, coincident, with, the, death, of, anders, celsius, the, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, reversed, celsius, s, scale, his, custom, made, linnaeus, thermometer, for, use, in, his, greenhouses, was, made, by, daniel, ekstr, m, sweden, s, leading, maker, of, scientific, instruments, at, the, time, whose, workshop, was, located, in, the, basement, of, the, stockholm, observatory, as, often, happened, in, this, age, before, modern, communications, numerous, physicists, scientists, and, instrument, makers, are, credited, with, having, independently, developed, this, same, scale, among, them, were, pehr, elvius, the, secretary, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, which, had, an, instrument, workshop, and, with, whom, linnaeus, had, been, corresponding, daniel, ekstr, m, the, instrument, maker, and, m, rten, str, mer, 1707, 1770, who, had, studied, astronomy, under, anders, celsius, the, first, known, swedish, document, reporting, temperatures, in, this, modern, forward, celsius, temperature, scale, is, the, paper, hortus, upsaliensis, dated, 16, december, 1745, that, linnaeus, wrote, to, a, student, of, his, samuel, naucl, r, in, it, linnaeus, recounted, the, temperatures, inside, the, orangery, at, the, university, of, uppsala, botanical, garden, since, the, caldarium, the, hot, part, of, the, greenhouse, by, the, angle, of, the, windows, merely, from, the, rays, of, the, sun, obtains, such, heat, that, the, thermometer, often, reaches, 30, degrees, although, the, keen, gardener, usually, takes, care, not, to, let, it, rise, to, more, than, 20, to, 25, degrees, and, in, winter, not, under, 15, degrees, since, the, 19th, century, the, scientific, and, thermometry, communities, worldwide, have, used, the, phrase, centigrade, scale, and, temperatures, were, often, reported, simply, as, degrees, or, when, greater, specificity, was, desired, as, degrees, centigrade, with, the, symbol, c, in, the, french, language, the, term, centigrade, also, means, one, hundredth, of, a, gradian, when, used, for, angular, measurement, the, term, centesimal, degree, was, later, introduced, for, temperatures, but, was, also, problematic, as, it, means, gradian, one, hundredth, of, a, right, angle, in, the, french, and, spanish, languages, the, risk, of, confusion, between, temperature, and, angular, measurement, was, eliminated, in, 1948, when, the, 9th, meeting, of, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, and, the, comit, international, des, poids, et, mesures, cipm, formally, adopted, degree, celsius, for, temperature, while, celsius, is, commonly, used, in, scientific, work, centigrade, is, still, used, in, french, and, english, speaking, countries, especially, in, informal, contexts, albeit, less, and, less, while, in, australia, from, 1, september, 1972, only, celsius, measurements, were, given, for, temperature, in, weather, reports, forecasts, it, was, not, until, february, 1985, that, the, weather, forecasts, issued, by, the, bbc, switched, from, centigrade, to, celsius, all, phase, transitions, are, at, standard, atmosphere, figures, are, either, by, definition, or, approximated, from, empirical, measurements, the, degree, celsius, has, been, the, only, si, unit, whose, full, unit, name, contains, an, uppercase, letter, since, 1967, when, the, si, base, unit, for, temperature, became, the, kelvin, replacing, the, capitalized, term, degrees, kelvin, the, plural, form, is, degrees, celsius, the, general, rule, of, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, is, that, the, numerical, value, always, precedes, the, unit, and, a, space, is, always, used, to, separate, the, unit, from, the, number, e, g, 30, 2, c, not, 30, 2, c, or, 30, 2, c, the, only, exceptions, to, this, rule, are, for, the, unit, symbols, for, degree, minute, and, second, for, plane, angle, and, respectively, for, which, no, space, is, left, between, the, numerical, value, and, the, unit, symbol, other, languages, and, various, publishing, houses, may, follow, different, typographical, rules, unicode, provides, the, celsius, symbol, at, code, point, u, 2103, degree, celsius, however, this, is, a, compatibility, character, provided, for, roundtrip, compatibility, with, legacy, encodings, it, easily, allows, correct, rendering, for, vertically, written, east, asian, scripts, such, as, chinese, the, unicode, standard, explicitly, discourages, the, use, of, this, character, in, normal, use, it, is, better, to, represent, degrees, celsius, c, with, a, sequence, of, u, 00b0, degree, sign, u, 0043, c, latin, capital, letter, c, rather, than, u, 2103, degree, celsius, for, searching, treat, these, two, sequences, as, identical, the, degree, celsius, is, subject, to, the, same, rules, as, the, kelvin, with, regard, to, the, use, of, its, unit, name, and, symbol, thus, besides, expressing, specific, temperatures, along, its, scale, e, g, gallium, melts, at, 29, 7646, c, and, the, temperature, outside, is, 23, degrees, celsius, the, degree, celsius, is, also, suitable, for, expressing, temperature, intervals, differences, between, temperatures, or, their, uncertainties, e, g, the, output, of, the, heat, exchanger, is, hotter, by, 40, degrees, celsius, and, our, standard, uncertainty, is, 3, c, because, of, this, dual, usage, one, must, not, rely, upon, the, unit, name, or, its, symbol, to, denote, that, a, quantity, is, a, temperature, interval, it, must, be, unambiguous, through, context, or, explicit, statement, that, the, quantity, is, an, interval, this, is, sometimes, solved, by, using, the, symbol, c, pronounced, degrees, celsius, for, a, temperature, and, c, pronounced, celsius, degrees, for, a, temperature, interval, although, this, usage, is, non, standard, another, way, to, express, the, same, is, 40, c, 3, k, which, can, be, commonly, found, in, literature, celsius, measurement, follows, an, interval, system, but, not, a, ratio, system, and, it, follows, a, relative, scale, not, an, absolute, scale, for, example, an, object, at, 20, c, does, not, have, twice, the, energy, of, when, it, is, 10, c, and, 0, c, is, not, the, lowest, celsius, value, thus, degrees, celsius, is, a, useful, interval, measurement, but, does, not, possess, the, characteristics, of, ratio, measures, like, weight, or, distance, in, science, and, in, engineering, the, celsius, and, kelvin, scales, are, often, used, in, combination, in, close, contexts, e, g, a, measured, value, was, 0, 01023, c, with, an, uncertainty, of, 70, k, this, practice, is, permissible, because, the, magnitude, of, the, degree, celsius, is, equal, to, that, of, the, kelvin, notwithstanding, the, official, endorsement, provided, by, decision, no, 3, of, resolution, 3, of, the, 13th, cgpm, which, stated, a, temperature, interval, may, also, be, expressed, in, degrees, celsius, the, practice, of, simultaneously, using, both, c, and, k, remains, widespread, throughout, the, scientific, world, as, the, use, of, si, prefixed, forms, of, the, degree, celsius, such, as, c, or, microdegrees, celsius, to, express, a, temperature, interval, has, not, been, widely, adopted, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, water, are, no, longer, part, of, the, definition, of, the, celsius, temperature, scale, in, 1948, the, definition, was, changed, to, use, the, triple, point, of, water, in, 2005, the, definition, was, further, refined, to, use, water, with, precisely, defined, isotopic, composition, vsmow, for, the, triple, point, in, 2019, the, definition, was, changed, to, use, the, boltzmann, constant, completely, decoupling, the, definition, of, the, kelvin, from, the, properties, of, water, each, of, these, formal, definitions, left, the, numerical, values, of, the, celsius, temperature, scale, identical, to, the, prior, definition, to, within, the, limits, of, accuracy, of, the, metrology, of, the, time, when, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, water, ceased, being, part, of, the, definition, they, became, measured, quantities, instead, this, is, also, true, of, the, triple, point, in, 1948, when, the, 9th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, in, resolution, 3, first, considered, using, the, triple, point, of, water, as, a, defining, point, the, triple, point, was, so, close, to, being, 0, 01, c, greater, than, water, s, known, melting, point, it, was, simply, defined, as, precisely, 0, 01, c, however, later, measurements, showed, that, the, difference, between, the, triple, and, melting, points, of, vsmow, is, actually, very, slightly, 0, 001, c, greater, than, 0, 01, c, thus, the, actual, melting, point, of, ice, is, very, slightly, less, than, a, thousandth, of, a, degree, below, 0, c, also, defining, water, s, triple, point, at, 273, 16, k, precisely, defined, the, magnitude, of, each, 1, c, increment, in, terms, of, the, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, referencing, absolute, zero, now, decoupled, from, the, actual, boiling, point, of, water, the, value, 100, c, is, hotter, than, 0, c, in, absolute, terms, by, a, factor, of, exactly, 373, 15, 273, 15, approximately, 36, 61, thermodynamically, hotter, when, adhering, strictly, to, the, two, point, definition, for, calibration, the, boiling, point, of, vsmow, under, one, standard, atmosphere, of, pressure, was, actually, 373, 1339, k, 99, 9839, c, when, calibrated, to, its, 90, a, calibration, standard, comprising, many, definition, points, and, commonly, used, for, high, precision, instrumentation, the, boiling, point, of, vsmow, was, slightly, less, about, 99, 974, c, this, boiling, point, difference, of, 16, 1, millikelvins, between, the, celsius, temperature, scale, s, original, definition, and, the, previous, one, based, on, absolute, zero, and, the, triple, point, has, little, practical, meaning, in, common, daily, applications, because, water, s, boiling, point, is, very, sensitive, to, variations, in, barometric, pressure, for, example, an, altitude, change, of, only, 28, cm, 11, in, causes, the, boiling, point, to, change, by, one, millikelvin, the, dictionary, definition, of, celsius, at, wiktionary
