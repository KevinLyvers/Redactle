in, common, usage, climate, change, describes, global, warming, the, ongoing, increase, in, global, average, temperature, and, its, effects, on, earth, s, climate, system, climate, change, in, a, broader, sense, also, includes, previous, long, term, changes, to, earth, s, climate, the, current, rise, in, global, average, temperature, is, primarily, caused, by, humans, burning, fossil, fuels, since, the, industrial, revolution, fossil, fuel, use, deforestation, and, some, agricultural, and, industrial, practices, add, to, greenhouse, gases, these, gases, absorb, some, of, the, heat, that, the, earth, radiates, after, it, warms, from, sunlight, warming, the, lower, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, the, primary, greenhouse, gas, driving, global, warming, has, grown, by, about, 50, and, is, at, levels, unseen, for, millions, of, years, climate, change, has, an, increasingly, large, impact, on, the, environment, deserts, are, expanding, while, heat, waves, and, wildfires, are, becoming, more, common, amplified, warming, in, the, arctic, has, contributed, to, thawing, permafrost, retreat, of, glaciers, and, sea, ice, decline, higher, temperatures, are, also, causing, more, intense, storms, droughts, and, other, weather, extremes, rapid, environmental, change, in, mountains, coral, reefs, and, the, arctic, is, forcing, many, species, to, relocate, or, become, extinct, even, if, efforts, to, minimize, future, warming, are, successful, some, effects, will, continue, for, centuries, these, include, ocean, heating, ocean, acidification, and, sea, level, rise, climate, change, threatens, people, with, increased, flooding, extreme, heat, increased, food, and, water, scarcity, more, disease, and, economic, loss, human, migration, and, conflict, can, also, be, a, result, the, world, health, organization, who, calls, climate, change, one, of, the, biggest, threats, to, global, health, in, the, 21st, century, societies, and, ecosystems, will, experience, more, severe, risks, without, action, to, limit, warming, adapting, to, climate, change, through, efforts, like, flood, control, measures, or, drought, resistant, crops, partially, reduces, climate, change, risks, although, some, limits, to, adaptation, have, already, been, reached, poorer, communities, are, responsible, for, a, small, share, of, global, emissions, yet, have, the, least, ability, to, adapt, and, are, most, vulnerable, to, climate, change, many, climate, change, impacts, have, been, felt, in, recent, years, with, 2023, the, warmest, on, record, at, 1, 48, c, 2, 66, f, since, regular, tracking, began, in, 1850, additional, warming, will, increase, these, impacts, and, can, trigger, tipping, points, such, as, melting, all, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, under, the, 2015, paris, agreement, nations, collectively, agreed, to, keep, warming, well, under, 2, c, however, with, pledges, made, under, the, agreement, global, warming, would, still, reach, about, 2, 7, c, 4, 9, f, by, the, end, of, the, century, limiting, warming, to, 1, 5, c, would, require, halving, emissions, by, 2030, and, achieving, net, zero, emissions, by, 2050, fossil, fuel, use, can, be, phased, out, by, conserving, energy, and, switching, to, energy, sources, that, do, not, produce, significant, carbon, pollution, these, energy, sources, include, wind, solar, hydro, and, nuclear, power, cleanly, generated, electricity, can, replace, fossil, fuels, for, powering, transportation, heating, buildings, and, running, industrial, processes, carbon, can, also, be, removed, from, the, atmosphere, for, instance, by, increasing, forest, cover, and, farming, with, methods, that, capture, carbon, in, soil, before, the, 1980s, it, was, unclear, whether, the, warming, effect, of, increased, greenhouse, gases, was, stronger, than, the, cooling, effect, of, airborne, particulates, in, air, pollution, scientists, used, the, term, inadvertent, climate, modification, to, refer, to, human, impacts, on, the, climate, at, this, time, in, the, 1980s, the, terms, global, warming, and, climate, change, became, more, common, often, being, used, interchangeably, scientifically, global, warming, refers, only, to, increased, surface, warming, while, climate, change, describes, both, global, warming, and, its, effects, on, earth, s, climate, system, such, as, precipitation, changes, climate, change, can, also, be, used, more, broadly, to, include, changes, to, the, climate, that, have, happened, throughout, earth, s, history, global, warming, used, as, early, as, 1975, became, the, more, popular, term, after, nasa, climate, scientist, james, hansen, used, it, in, his, 1988, testimony, in, the, u, s, senate, since, the, 2000s, climate, change, has, increased, usage, various, scientists, politicians, and, media, may, use, the, terms, climate, crisis, or, climate, emergency, to, talk, about, climate, change, and, may, use, the, term, global, heating, instead, of, global, warming, over, the, last, few, million, years, human, beings, evolved, in, a, climate, that, cycled, through, ice, ages, with, global, average, temperature, ranging, between, 1, c, warmer, and, 5, 6, c, colder, than, current, levels, one, of, the, hotter, periods, was, the, last, interglacial, between, 115, 000, and, 130, 000, years, ago, when, sea, levels, were, 6, to, 9, metres, higher, than, today, the, most, recent, glacial, maximum, 20, 000, years, ago, had, sea, levels, that, were, about, 125, metres, 410, ft, lower, than, today, temperatures, stabilized, in, the, current, interglacial, period, beginning, 11, 700, years, ago, historical, patterns, of, warming, and, cooling, like, the, medieval, warm, period, and, the, little, ice, age, did, not, occur, at, the, same, time, across, different, regions, temperatures, may, have, reached, as, high, as, those, of, the, late, 20th, century, in, a, limited, set, of, regions, climate, information, for, that, period, comes, from, climate, proxies, such, as, trees, and, ice, cores, around, 1850, thermometer, records, began, to, provide, global, coverage, between, the, 18th, century, and, 1970, there, was, little, net, warming, as, the, warming, impact, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, was, offset, by, cooling, from, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, sulfur, dioxide, causes, acid, rain, but, it, also, produces, sulfate, aerosols, in, the, atmosphere, which, reflect, sunlight, and, cause, so, called, global, dimming, after, 1970, the, increasing, accumulation, of, greenhouse, gases, and, controls, on, sulfur, pollution, led, to, a, marked, increase, in, temperature, ongoing, changes, in, climate, have, had, no, precedent, for, several, thousand, years, multiple, independent, datasets, all, show, worldwide, increases, in, surface, temperature, at, a, rate, of, around, 0, 2, c, per, decade, the, 2013, 2022, decade, warmed, to, an, average, 1, 15, c, compared, to, the, pre, industrial, baseline, 1850, 1900, not, every, single, year, was, warmer, than, the, last, internal, climate, variability, processes, can, make, any, year, 0, 2, c, warmer, or, colder, than, the, average, from, 1998, to, 2013, negative, phases, of, two, such, processes, pacific, decadal, oscillation, pdo, and, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, amo, caused, a, so, called, global, warming, hiatus, after, the, hiatus, the, opposite, occurred, with, years, like, 2023, exhibiting, temperatures, well, above, even, the, recent, average, this, is, why, the, temperature, change, is, defined, in, terms, of, a, 20, year, average, which, reduces, the, noise, of, hot, and, cold, years, and, decadal, climate, patterns, and, detects, the, long, term, signal, 5, a, wide, range, of, other, observations, reinforce, the, evidence, of, warming, the, upper, atmosphere, is, cooling, because, greenhouse, gases, are, trapping, heat, near, the, earth, s, surface, and, so, less, heat, is, radiating, into, space, warming, reduces, average, snow, cover, and, forces, the, retreat, of, glaciers, at, the, same, time, warming, also, causes, greater, evaporation, from, the, oceans, leading, to, more, atmospheric, humidity, more, and, heavier, precipitation, plants, are, flowering, earlier, in, spring, and, thousands, of, animal, species, have, been, permanently, moving, to, cooler, areas, different, regions, of, the, world, warm, at, different, rates, the, pattern, is, independent, of, where, greenhouse, gases, are, emitted, because, the, gases, persist, long, enough, to, diffuse, across, the, planet, since, the, pre, industrial, period, the, average, surface, temperature, over, land, regions, has, increased, almost, twice, as, fast, as, the, global, average, surface, temperature, this, is, because, oceans, lose, more, heat, by, evaporation, and, oceans, can, store, a, lot, of, heat, the, thermal, energy, in, the, global, climate, system, has, grown, with, only, brief, pauses, since, at, least, 1970, and, over, 90, of, this, extra, energy, has, been, stored, in, the, ocean, the, rest, has, heated, the, atmosphere, melted, ice, and, warmed, the, continents, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, north, pole, have, warmed, much, faster, than, the, south, pole, and, southern, hemisphere, the, northern, hemisphere, not, only, has, much, more, land, but, also, more, seasonal, snow, cover, and, sea, ice, as, these, surfaces, flip, from, reflecting, a, lot, of, light, to, being, dark, after, the, ice, has, melted, they, start, absorbing, more, heat, local, black, carbon, deposits, on, snow, and, ice, also, contribute, to, arctic, warming, arctic, surface, temperatures, are, increasing, between, three, and, four, times, faster, than, in, the, rest, of, the, world, melting, of, ice, sheets, near, the, poles, weakens, both, the, atlantic, and, the, antarctic, limb, of, thermohaline, circulation, which, further, changes, the, distribution, of, heat, and, precipitation, around, the, globe, the, world, meteorological, organization, estimates, a, 66, chance, of, global, temperatures, exceeding, 1, 5, c, warming, from, the, preindustrial, baseline, for, at, least, one, year, between, 2023, and, 2027, because, the, ipcc, uses, a, 20, year, average, to, define, global, temperature, changes, a, single, year, exceeding, 1, 5, c, does, not, break, the, limit, the, ipcc, expects, the, 20, year, average, global, temperature, to, exceed, 1, 5, c, in, the, early, 2030s, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, 2023, included, projections, that, by, 2100, global, warming, is, very, likely, to, reach, 1, 0, 1, 8, c, under, a, scenario, with, very, low, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, 2, 1, 3, 5, c, under, an, intermediate, emissions, scenario, or, 3, 3, 5, 7, c, under, a, very, high, emissions, scenario, the, warming, will, continue, past, 2100, in, the, intermediate, and, high, emission, scenarios, with, future, projections, of, global, surface, temperatures, by, year, 2300, being, similar, to, millions, of, years, ago, the, remaining, carbon, budget, for, staying, beneath, certain, temperature, increases, is, determined, by, modelling, the, carbon, cycle, and, climate, sensitivity, to, greenhouse, gases, according, to, the, ipcc, global, warming, can, be, kept, below, 1, 5, c, with, a, two, thirds, chance, if, emissions, after, 2018, do, not, exceed, 420, or, 570, gigatonnes, of, co, 2, this, corresponds, to, 10, to, 13, years, of, current, emissions, there, are, high, uncertainties, about, the, budget, for, instance, it, may, be, 100, gigatonnes, of, co, 2, equivalent, smaller, due, to, co, 2, and, methane, release, from, permafrost, and, wetlands, however, it, is, clear, that, fossil, fuel, resources, need, to, be, proactively, kept, in, the, ground, to, prevent, substantial, warming, otherwise, their, shortages, would, not, occur, until, the, emissions, have, already, locked, in, significant, long, term, impacts, the, climate, system, experiences, various, cycles, on, its, own, which, can, last, for, years, decades, or, even, centuries, for, example, el, ni, o, events, cause, short, term, spikes, in, surface, temperature, while, la, ni, a, events, cause, short, term, cooling, their, relative, frequency, can, affect, global, temperature, trends, on, a, decadal, timescale, other, changes, are, caused, by, an, imbalance, of, energy, from, external, forcings, examples, of, these, include, changes, in, the, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, solar, luminosity, volcanic, eruptions, and, variations, in, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, to, determine, the, human, contribution, to, climate, change, unique, fingerprints, for, all, potential, causes, are, developed, and, compared, with, both, observed, patterns, and, known, internal, climate, variability, for, example, solar, forcing, whose, fingerprint, involves, warming, the, entire, atmosphere, is, ruled, out, because, only, the, lower, atmosphere, has, warmed, atmospheric, aerosols, produce, a, smaller, cooling, effect, other, drivers, such, as, changes, in, albedo, are, less, impactful, greenhouse, gases, are, transparent, to, sunlight, and, thus, allow, it, to, pass, through, the, atmosphere, to, heat, the, earth, s, surface, the, earth, radiates, it, as, heat, and, greenhouse, gases, absorb, a, portion, of, it, this, absorption, slows, the, rate, at, which, heat, escapes, into, space, trapping, heat, near, the, earth, s, surface, and, warming, it, over, time, while, water, vapour, 50, and, clouds, 25, are, the, biggest, contributors, to, the, greenhouse, effect, they, primarily, change, as, a, function, of, temperature, and, are, therefore, mostly, considered, to, be, feedbacks, that, change, climate, sensitivity, on, the, other, hand, concentrations, of, gases, such, as, co, 2, 20, tropospheric, ozone, cfcs, and, nitrous, oxide, are, added, or, removed, independently, from, temperature, and, are, therefore, considered, to, be, external, forcings, that, change, global, temperatures, before, the, industrial, revolution, naturally, occurring, amounts, of, greenhouse, gases, caused, the, air, near, the, surface, to, be, about, 33, c, warmer, than, it, would, have, been, in, their, absence, human, activity, since, the, industrial, revolution, mainly, extracting, and, burning, fossil, fuels, coal, oil, and, natural, gas, has, increased, the, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, resulting, in, a, radiative, imbalance, in, 2019, the, concentrations, of, co, 2, and, methane, had, increased, by, about, 48, and, 160, respectively, since, 1750, these, co, 2, levels, are, higher, than, they, have, been, at, any, time, during, the, last, 2, million, years, concentrations, of, methane, are, far, higher, than, they, were, over, the, last, 800, 000, years, global, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2019, were, equivalent, to, 59, billion, tonnes, of, co, 2, of, these, emissions, 75, was, co, 2, 18, was, methane, 4, was, nitrous, oxide, and, 2, was, fluorinated, gases, co, 2, emissions, primarily, come, from, burning, fossil, fuels, to, provide, energy, for, transport, manufacturing, heating, and, electricity, additional, co, 2, emissions, come, from, deforestation, and, industrial, processes, which, include, the, co, 2, released, by, the, chemical, reactions, for, making, cement, steel, aluminum, and, fertilizer, methane, emissions, come, from, livestock, manure, rice, cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and, coal, mining, as, well, as, oil, and, gas, extraction, nitrous, oxide, emissions, largely, come, from, the, microbial, decomposition, of, fertilizer, while, methane, only, lasts, in, the, atmosphere, for, an, average, of, 12, years, co, 2, lasts, much, longer, the, earth, s, surface, absorbs, co2, as, part, of, the, carbon, cycle, while, plants, on, land, and, in, the, ocean, absorb, most, excess, emissions, of, co, 2, every, year, that, co, 2, is, returned, to, the, atmosphere, when, biological, matter, is, digested, burns, or, decays, land, surface, carbon, sink, processes, such, as, carbon, fixation, in, the, soil, and, photosynthesis, remove, about, 29, of, annual, global, co, 2, emissions, the, ocean, has, absorbed, 20, to, 30, of, emitted, co, 2, over, the, last, 2, decades, co, 2, is, only, removed, from, the, atmosphere, for, the, long, term, when, it, is, stored, in, the, earth, s, crust, which, is, a, process, that, can, take, millions, of, years, to, complete, according, to, food, and, agriculture, organization, around, 30, of, earth, s, land, area, is, largely, unusable, for, humans, glaciers, deserts, etc, 26, is, forests, 10, is, shrubland, and, 34, is, agricultural, land, deforestation, is, the, main, land, use, change, contributor, to, global, warming, as, the, destroyed, trees, release, co, 2, and, are, not, replaced, by, new, trees, removing, that, carbon, sink, between, 2001, and, 2018, 27, of, deforestation, was, from, permanent, clearing, to, enable, agricultural, expansion, for, crops, and, livestock, another, 24, has, been, lost, to, temporary, clearing, under, the, shifting, cultivation, agricultural, systems, 26, was, due, to, logging, for, wood, and, derived, products, and, wildfires, have, accounted, for, the, remaining, 23, some, forests, have, not, been, fully, cleared, but, were, already, degraded, by, these, impacts, restoring, these, forests, also, recovers, their, potential, as, a, carbon, sink, local, vegetation, cover, impacts, how, much, of, the, sunlight, gets, reflected, back, into, space, albedo, and, how, much, heat, is, lost, by, evaporation, for, instance, the, change, from, a, dark, forest, to, grassland, makes, the, surface, lighter, causing, it, to, reflect, more, sunlight, deforestation, can, also, modify, the, release, of, chemical, compounds, that, influence, clouds, and, by, changing, wind, patterns, in, tropic, and, temperate, areas, the, net, effect, is, to, produce, significant, warming, and, forest, restoration, can, make, local, temperatures, cooler, at, latitudes, closer, to, the, poles, there, is, a, cooling, effect, as, forest, is, replaced, by, snow, covered, and, more, reflective, plains, globally, these, increases, in, surface, albedo, have, been, the, dominant, direct, influence, on, temperature, from, land, use, change, thus, land, use, change, to, date, is, estimated, to, have, a, slight, cooling, effect, air, pollution, in, the, form, of, aerosols, affects, the, climate, on, a, large, scale, aerosols, scatter, and, absorb, solar, radiation, from, 1961, to, 1990, a, gradual, reduction, in, the, amount, of, sunlight, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, was, observed, this, phenomenon, is, popularly, known, as, global, dimming, and, is, primarily, attributed, to, sulfate, aerosols, produced, by, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, with, heavy, sulfur, concentrations, like, coal, and, bunker, fuel, smaller, contributions, come, from, black, carbon, organic, carbon, from, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, and, biofuels, and, from, anthropogenic, dust, globally, aerosols, have, been, declining, since, 1990, due, to, pollution, controls, meaning, that, they, no, longer, mask, greenhouse, gas, warming, as, much, aerosols, also, have, indirect, effects, on, the, earth, s, energy, budget, sulfate, aerosols, act, as, cloud, condensation, nuclei, and, lead, to, clouds, that, have, more, and, smaller, cloud, droplets, these, clouds, reflect, solar, radiation, more, efficiently, than, clouds, with, fewer, and, larger, droplets, they, also, reduce, the, growth, of, raindrops, which, makes, clouds, more, reflective, to, incoming, sunlight, indirect, effects, of, aerosols, are, the, largest, uncertainty, in, radiative, forcing, while, aerosols, typically, limit, global, warming, by, reflecting, sunlight, black, carbon, in, soot, that, falls, on, snow, or, ice, can, contribute, to, global, warming, not, only, does, this, increase, the, absorption, of, sunlight, it, also, increases, melting, and, sea, level, rise, limiting, new, black, carbon, deposits, in, the, arctic, could, reduce, global, warming, by, 0, 2, c, by, 2050, the, effect, of, decreasing, sulfur, content, of, fuel, oil, for, ships, since, 2020, is, estimated, to, cause, an, additional, 0, 05, c, increase, in, global, mean, temperature, by, 2050, as, the, sun, is, the, earth, s, primary, energy, source, changes, in, incoming, sunlight, directly, affect, the, climate, system, solar, irradiance, has, been, measured, directly, by, satellites, and, indirect, measurements, are, available, from, the, early, 1600s, onwards, since, 1880, there, has, been, no, upward, trend, in, the, amount, of, the, sun, s, energy, reaching, the, earth, in, contrast, to, the, warming, of, the, lower, atmosphere, the, troposphere, the, upper, atmosphere, the, stratosphere, would, also, be, warming, if, the, sun, was, sending, more, energy, to, earth, but, instead, it, has, been, cooling, this, is, consistent, with, greenhouse, gases, preventing, heat, from, leaving, the, earth, s, atmosphere, explosive, volcanic, eruptions, can, release, gases, dust, and, ash, that, partially, block, sunlight, and, reduce, temperatures, or, they, can, send, water, vapour, into, the, atmosphere, which, adds, to, greenhouse, gases, and, increases, temperatures, these, impacts, on, temperature, only, last, for, several, years, because, both, water, vapour, and, volcanic, material, have, low, persistence, in, the, atmosphere, volcanic, co, 2, emissions, are, more, persistent, but, they, are, equivalent, to, less, than, 1, of, current, human, caused, co, 2, emissions, volcanic, activity, still, represents, the, single, largest, natural, impact, forcing, on, temperature, in, the, industrial, era, yet, like, the, other, natural, forcings, it, has, had, negligible, impacts, on, global, temperature, trends, since, the, industrial, revolution, the, response, of, the, climate, system, to, an, initial, forcing, is, modified, by, feedbacks, increased, by, self, reinforcing, or, positive, feedbacks, and, reduced, by, balancing, or, negative, feedbacks, the, main, reinforcing, feedbacks, are, the, water, vapour, feedback, the, ice, albedo, feedback, and, the, net, effect, of, clouds, the, primary, balancing, mechanism, is, radiative, cooling, as, earth, s, surface, gives, off, more, heat, to, space, in, response, to, rising, temperature, in, addition, to, temperature, feedbacks, there, are, feedbacks, in, the, carbon, cycle, such, as, the, fertilizing, effect, of, co, 2, on, plant, growth, feedbacks, are, expected, to, trend, in, a, positive, direction, as, greenhouse, gas, emissions, continue, raising, climate, sensitivity, radiative, feedbacks, are, physical, processes, that, influence, the, rate, of, global, warming, in, response, to, warming, for, instance, warmer, air, can, hold, more, moisture, and, water, vapour, itself, is, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, warmer, air, can, also, result, in, clouds, becoming, higher, and, thinner, where, they, act, as, an, insulator, and, warm, the, planet, another, major, feedback, is, the, reduction, of, snow, cover, and, sea, ice, in, the, arctic, reducing, the, reflectivity, of, the, earth, s, surface, there, and, contributing, to, amplification, of, arctic, temperature, changes, arctic, amplification, is, also, thawing, permafrost, which, releases, methane, and, co, 2, into, the, atmosphere, around, half, of, human, caused, co, 2, emissions, have, been, absorbed, by, land, plants, and, by, the, oceans, this, fraction, is, not, static, and, if, future, co, 2, emissions, decrease, the, earth, will, be, able, to, absorb, up, to, around, 70, if, they, increase, substantially, it, ll, still, absorb, more, carbon, than, now, but, the, overall, fraction, will, decrease, to, below, 40, this, is, because, climate, change, increases, droughts, and, heat, waves, that, eventually, inhibit, plant, growth, on, land, and, soils, will, release, more, carbon, from, dead, plants, when, they, are, warmer, the, rate, at, which, oceans, absorb, atmospheric, carbon, will, be, lowered, as, they, become, more, acidic, and, experience, changes, in, thermohaline, circulation, and, phytoplankton, distribution, uncertainty, over, feedbacks, particularly, cloud, cover, is, the, major, reason, why, different, climate, models, project, different, magnitudes, of, warming, for, a, given, amount, of, emissions, a, climate, model, is, a, representation, of, the, physical, chemical, and, biological, processes, that, affect, the, climate, system, models, include, natural, processes, like, changes, in, the, earth, s, orbit, historical, changes, in, the, sun, s, activity, and, volcanic, forcing, models, are, used, to, estimate, the, degree, of, warming, future, emissions, will, cause, when, accounting, for, the, strength, of, climate, feedbacks, models, also, predict, the, circulation, of, the, oceans, the, annual, cycle, of, the, seasons, and, the, flows, of, carbon, between, the, land, surface, and, the, atmosphere, the, physical, realism, of, models, is, tested, by, examining, their, ability, to, simulate, current, or, past, climates, past, models, have, underestimated, the, rate, of, arctic, shrinkage, and, underestimated, the, rate, of, precipitation, increase, sea, level, rise, since, 1990, was, underestimated, in, older, models, but, more, recent, models, agree, well, with, observations, the, 2017, united, states, published, national, climate, assessment, notes, that, climate, models, may, still, be, underestimating, or, missing, relevant, feedback, processes, additionally, climate, models, may, be, unable, to, adequately, predict, short, term, regional, climatic, shifts, a, subset, of, climate, models, add, societal, factors, to, a, physical, climate, model, these, models, simulate, how, population, economic, growth, and, energy, use, affect, and, interact, with, the, physical, climate, with, this, information, these, models, can, produce, scenarios, of, future, greenhouse, gas, emissions, this, is, then, used, as, input, for, physical, climate, models, and, carbon, cycle, models, to, predict, how, atmospheric, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, might, change, depending,

of, climate, change, are, broad, and, far, reaching, affecting, oceans, ice, and, weather, changes, may, occur, gradually, or, rapidly, evidence, for, these, effects, comes, from, studying, climate, change, in, the, past, from, modelling, and, from, modern, observations, since, the, 1950s, droughts, and, heat, waves, have, appeared, simultaneously, with, increasing, frequency, extremely, wet, or, dry, events, within, the, monsoon, period, have, increased, in, india, and, east, asia, monsoonal, precipitation, over, the, northern, hemisphere, has, increased, since, 1980, the, rainfall, rate, and, intensity, of, hurricanes, and, typhoons, is, likely, increasing, and, the, geographic, range, likely, expanding, poleward, in, response, to, climate, warming, frequency, of, tropical, cyclones, has, not, increased, as, a, result, of, climate, change, global, sea, level, is, rising, as, a, consequence, of, thermal, expansion, and, the, melting, of, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, between, 1993, and, 2020, the, rise, increased, over, time, averaging, 3, 3, 0, 3, mm, per, year, over, the, 21st, century, the, ipcc, projects, 32, 62, cm, of, sea, level, rise, under, a, low, emission, scenario,

beyond, which, certain, major, impacts, can, no, longer, be, avoided, even, if, temperatures, return, to, their, previous, state, for, instance, the, greenland, ice, sheet, is, already, melting, but, if, global, warming, reaches, levels, between, 1, 7, c, and, 2, 3, c, its, melting, will, continue, until, it, fully, disappears, if, the, warming, is, later, reduced, to, 1, 5, c, or, less, it, will, still, lose, a, lot, more, ice, than, if, the, warming, was, never, allowed, to, reach, the, threshold, in, the, first, place, while, the, ice, sheets, would, melt, over, millennia, other, tipping, points, would, occur, faster, and, give, societies, less, time, to, respond, the, collapse, of, major, ocean, currents, like, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, and, irreversible, damage, to, key, ecosystems, like, the, amazon, rainforest, and, coral, reefs, can, unfold, in, a, matter, of, decades, the, long, term, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, include, further, ice, melt, ocean, warming, sea, level, rise, ocean, acidification, and, ocean, deoxygenation, the, timescale, of, long, term, impacts, are, centuries, to, millennia, due, to, co, 2, s, long, atmospheric, lifetime, when, net, emissions, stabilize, surface, air, temperatures, will, also, stabilize, but, oceans, and, ice, caps, will, continue, to, absorb, excess, heat, from, the,

beccs, can, result, in, net, negative, emissions, as, co, 2, is, drawn, from, the, atmosphere, it, remains, highly, uncertain, whether, carbon, dioxide, removal, techniques, will, be, able, to, play, a, large, role, in, limiting, warming, to, 1, 5, c, policy, decisions, that, rely, on, carbon, dioxide, removal, increase, the, risk, of, global, warming, rising, beyond, international, goals, adaptation, is, the, process, of, adjustment, to, current, or, expected, changes, in, climate, and, its, effects, 5, without, additional, mitigation, adaptation, cannot, avert, the, risk, of, severe, widespread, and, irreversible, impacts, more, severe, climate, change, requires, more, transformative, adaptation, which, can, be, prohibitively, expensive, the, capacity, and, potential, for, humans, to, adapt, is, unevenly, distributed, across, different, regions, and, populations, and, developing, countries, generally, have, less, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 21st, century, saw, an, increase, in, adaptive, capacity, in, most, low, and, middle, income, countries, with, improved, access, to, basic, sanitation, and, electricity, but, progress, is, slow, many, countries, have, implemented, adaptation, policies, however, there, is, a, considerable, gap, between, necessary, and, available, finance, adaptation, to, sea, level, rise, consists, of, avoiding, at, risk, areas, learning, to, live, with, increased, flooding, and, building, flood, controls, if, that, fails, managed, retreat, may, be, needed, there, are, economic, barriers, for, tackling, dangerous, heat,

favourable, climate, conditions, species, can, also, be, introduced, to, areas, acquiring, a, favourable, climate, protection, and, restoration, of, natural, and, semi, natural, areas, helps, build, resilience, making, it, easier, for, ecosystems, to, adapt, many, of, the, actions, that, promote, adaptation, in, ecosystems, also, help, humans, adapt, via, ecosystem, based, adaptation, for, instance, restoration, of, natural, fire, regimes, makes, catastrophic, fires, less, likely, and, reduces, human, exposure, giving, rivers, more, space, allows, for, more, water, storage, in, the, natural, system, reducing, flood, risk, restored, forest, acts, as, a, carbon, sink, but, planting, trees, in, unsuitable, regions, can, exacerbate, climate, impacts, there, are, synergies, but, also, trade, offs, between, adaptation, and, mitigation, an, example, for, synergy, is, increased, food, productivity, which, has, large, benefits, for, both, adaptation, and, mitigation, an, example, of, a, trade, off, is, that, increased, use, of, air, conditioning, allows, people, to, better, cope, with, heat, but, increases, energy, demand, another, trade, off, example, is, that, more, compact, urban, development, may, reduce, emissions, from, transport, and, construction, but, may, also, increase, the, urban, heat, island, effect, exposing, people, to, heat, related, health, risks, countries, that, are, most, vulnerable, to, climate, change, have, typically, been, responsible, for, a, small, share, of, global, emissions, this, raises, questions, about, justice, and, fairness, limiting, global, warming, makes, it, much, easier, to, achieve, the, un, s, sustainable, development, goals, such, as, eradicating, poverty, and, reducing, inequalities, the, connection, is, recognized, in, sustainable, development, goal, 13, which, is, to, take, urgent, action, to, combat, climate, change, and, its, impacts, the, goals, on, food, clean, water, and, ecosystem, protection, have, synergies, with, climate, mitigation, the, geopolitics, of, climate, change, is, complex, it, has, often, been, framed, as, a, free, rider, problem, in, which, all, countries, benefit, from, mitigation, done, by, other, countries, but, individual, countries, would, lose, from, switching, to, a, low, carbon, economy, themselves, sometimes, mitigation, also, has, localized, benefits, though, for, instance, the, benefits, of, a, coal, phase, out, to, public, health, and, local, environments, exceed, the, costs, in, almost, all, regions, furthermore, net, importers, of, fossil, fuels, win, economically, from, switching, to, clean, energy, causing, net, exporters, to, face, stranded, assets, fossil, fuels, they, cannot, sell, a, wide, range, of, policies, regulations, and, laws, are, being, used, to, reduce, emissions, as, of, 2019, carbon, pricing, covers, about, 20, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, carbon, can, be, priced, with, carbon, taxes, and, emissions,

human, rights, issues, and, social, inequality, according, to, proponents, of, climate, justice, the, costs, of, climate, adaptation, should, be, paid, by, those, most, responsible, for, climate, change, while, the, beneficiaries, of, payments, should, be, those, suffering, impacts, one, way, this, can, be, addressed, in, practice, is, to, have, wealthy, nations, pay, poorer, countries, to, adapt, oxfam, found, that, in, 2023, the, wealthiest, 10, of, people, were, responsible, for, 50, of, global, emissions, while, the, bottom, 50, were, responsible, for, just, 8, production, of, emissions, is, another, way, to, look, at, responsibility, under, that, approach, the, top, 21, fossil, fuel, companies, would, owe, cumulative, climate, reparations, of, 5, 4, trillion, over, the, period, 2025, 2050, to, achieve, a, just, transition, people, working, in, the, fossil, fuel, sector, would, also, need, other, jobs, and, their, communities, would, need, investments, nearly, all, countries, in, the, world, are, parties, to, the, 1994, united, nations, framework, convention, on, climate, change, unfccc, the, goal, of, the, unfccc, is, to, prevent, dangerous, human, interference, with, the, climate, system, as, stated, in, the, convention, this, requires, that, greenhouse, gas, concentrations, are, stabilized, in, the, atmosphere, at, a, level, where, ecosystems, can, adapt, naturally, to, climate, change, food, production, is, not, threatened, and, economic, development, can, be, sustained, the, unfccc, does, not, itself, restrict, emissions, but, rather, provides, a, framework, for, protocols, that, do, global, emissions, have, risen, since, the, unfccc, was, signed, its, yearly, conferences, are, the, stage, of, global, negotiations, the, 1997, kyoto, protocol, extended, the, unfccc, and, included, legally, binding, commitments, for, most, developed, countries, to, limit, their, emissions, during, the, negotiations, the, g77, representing, developing, countries, pushed, for, a, mandate, requiring, developed, countries, to, the, lead, in, reducing, their, emissions, since, developed, countries, contributed, most, to, the, accumulation, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, per, capita, emissions, were, also, still, relatively, low, in, developing, countries, and, developing, countries, would, need, to, emit, more, to, meet, their, development, needs, the, 2009, copenhagen, accord, has, been, widely, portrayed, as, disappointing, because, of, its, low, goals, and, was, rejected, by, poorer, nations, including, the, g77, associated, parties, aimed, to, limit, the, global, temperature, rise, to, below, 2, c, the, accord, set, the, goal, of, sending, 100, billion, per, year, to, developing, countries, for, mitigation, and, adaptation, by, 2020, and, proposed, the, founding, of, the, green, climate, fund, as, of, 2020, only, 83, 3, billion, were, delivered, only, in, 2023, the, target, is, expected, to, be, achieved, in, 2015, all, un, countries, negotiated, the, paris, agreement, which, aims, to, keep, global, warming, well, below, 2, 0, c, and, contains, an, aspirational, goal, of, keeping, warming, under, 1, 5, c, the, agreement, replaced, the, kyoto, protocol, unlike, kyoto, no, binding, emission, targets, were, set, in, the, paris, agreement, instead, a, set, of, procedures, was, made, binding, countries, have, to, regularly, set, ever, more, ambitious, goals, and, reevaluate, these, goals, every, five, years, the, paris, agreement, restated, that, developing, countries, must, be, financially, supported, as, of, october, 2021, 194, states, and, the, european, union, have, signed, the, treaty, and, 191, states, and, the, eu, have, ratified, or, acceded, to, the, agreement, the, 1987, montreal, protocol, an, international, agreement, to, stop, emitting, ozone, depleting, gases, may, have, been, more, effective, at, curbing, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, the, kyoto, protocol, specifically, designed, to, do, so, the, 2016, kigali, amendment, to, the, montreal, protocol, aims, to, reduce, the, emissions, of, hydrofluorocarbons, a, group, of, powerful, greenhouse, gases, which, served, as, a, replacement, for, banned, ozone, depleting, gases, this, made, the, montreal, protocol, a, stronger, agreement, against, climate, change, in, 2019, the, united, kingdom, parliament, became, the, first, national, government, to, declare, a, climate, emergency, other, countries, and, jurisdictions, followed, suit, that, same, year, the, european, parliament, declared, a, climate, and, environmental, emergency, the, european, commission, presented, its, european, green, deal, with, the, goal, of, making, the, eu, carbon, neutral, by, 2050, in, 2021, the, european, commission, released, its, fit, for, 55, legislation, package, which, contains, guidelines, for, the, car, industry, all, new, cars, on, the, european, market, must, be, zero, emission, vehicles, from, 2035, major, countries, in, asia, have, made, similar, pledges, south, korea, and, japan, have, committed, to, become, carbon, neutral, by, 2050, and, china, by, 2060, while, india, has, strong, incentives, for, renewables, it, also, plans, a, significant, expansion, of, coal, in, the, country, vietnam, is, among, very, few, coal, dependent, fast, developing, countries, that, pledged, to, phase, out, unabated, coal, power, by, the, 2040s, or, as, soon, as, possible, thereafter, as, of, 2021, based, on, information, from, 48, national, climate, plans, which, represent, 40, of, the, parties, to, the, paris, agreement, estimated, total, greenhouse, gas, emissions, will, be, 0, 5, lower, compared, to, 2010, levels, below, the, 45, or, 25, reduction, goals, to, limit, global, warming, to, 1, 5, c, or, 2, c, respectively, public, debate, about, climate, change, has, been, strongly, affected, by, climate, change, denial, and, misinformation, which, originated, in, the, united, states, and, has, since, spread, to, other, countries, particularly, canada, and, australia, climate, change, denial, has, originated, from, fossil, fuel, companies, industry, groups, conservative, think, tanks, and, contrarian, scientists, like, the, tobacco, industry, the, main, strategy, of, these, groups, has, been, to, manufacture, doubt, about, climate, change, related, scientific, data, and, results, people, who, hold, unwarranted, doubt, about, climate, change, are, called, climate, change, skeptics, although, contrarians, or, deniers, are, more, appropriate, terms, there, are, different, variants, of, climate, denial, some, deny, that, warming, takes, place, at, all, some, acknowledge, warming, but, attribute, it, to, natural, influences, and, some, minimize, the, negative, impacts, of, climate, change, manufacturing, uncertainty, about, the, science, later, developed, into, a, manufactured, controversy, creating, the, belief, that, there, is, significant, uncertainty, about, climate, change, within, the, scientific, community, in, order, to, delay, policy, changes, strategies, to, promote, these, ideas, include, criticism, of, scientific, institutions, and, questioning, the, motives, of, individual, scientists, an, echo, chamber, of, climate, denying, blogs, and, media, has, further, fomented, misunderstanding, of, climate, change, climate, change, came, to, international, public, attention, in, the, late, 1980s, due, to, media, coverage, in, the, early, 1990s, people, often, confused, climate, change, with, other, environmental, issues, like, ozone, depletion, in, popular, culture, the, climate, fiction, movie, the, day, after, tomorrow, 2004, and, the, al, gore, documentary, an, inconvenient, truth, 2006, focused, on, climate, change, significant, regional, gender, age, and, political, differences, exist, in, both, public, concern, for, and, understanding, of, climate, change, more, highly, educated, people, and, in, some, countries, women, and, younger, people, were, more, likely, to, see, climate, change, as, a, serious, threat, partisan, gaps, also, exist, in, many, countries, and, countries, with, high, co, 2, emissions, tend, to, be, less, concerned, views, on, causes, of, climate, change, vary, widely, between, countries, concern, has, increased, over, time, to, the, point, where, in, 2021, a, majority, of, citizens, in, many, countries, express, a, high, level, of, worry, about, climate, change, or, view, it, as, a, global, emergency, higher, levels, of, worry, are, associated, with, stronger, public, support, for, policies, that, address, climate, change, climate, protests, demand, that, political, leaders, take, action, to, prevent, climate, change, they, can, take, the, form, of, public, demonstrations, fossil, fuel, divestment, lawsuits, and, other, activities, prominent, demonstrations, include, the, school, strike, for, climate, in, this, initiative, young, people, across, the, globe, have, been, protesting, since, 2018, by, skipping, school, on, fridays, inspired, by, swedish, teenager, greta, thunberg, mass, civil, disobedience, actions, by, groups, like, extinction, rebellion, have, protested, by, disrupting, roads, and, public, transport, litigation, is, increasingly, used, as, a, tool, to, strengthen, climate, action, from, public, institutions, and, companies, activists, also, initiate, lawsuits, which, target, governments, and, demand, that, they, take, ambitious, action, or, enforce, existing, laws, on, climate, change, lawsuits, against, fossil, fuel, companies, generally, seek, compensation, for, loss, and, damage, scientists, in, the, 19th, century, such, as, alexander, von, humboldt, began, to, foresee, the, effects, of, climate, change, in, the, 1820s, joseph, fourier, proposed, the, greenhouse, effect, to, explain, why, earth, s, temperature, was, higher, than, the, sun, s, energy, alone, could, explain, earth, s, atmosphere, is, transparent, to, sunlight, so, sunlight, reaches, the, surface, where, it, is, converted, to, heat, however, the, atmosphere, is, not, transparent, to, heat, radiating, from, the, surface, and, captures, some, of, that, heat, which, in, turn, warms, the, planet, in, 1856, eunice, newton, foote, demonstrated, that, the, warming, effect, of, the, sun, is, greater, for, air, with, water, vapour, than, for, dry, air, and, that, the, effect, is, even, greater, with, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, she, concluded, that, an, atmosphere, of, that, gas, would, give, to, our, earth, a, high, temperature, starting, in, 1859, john, tyndall, established, that, nitrogen, and, oxygen, together, totalling, 99, of, dry, air, are, transparent, to, radiated, heat, however, water, vapour, and, gases, such, as, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, absorb, radiated, heat, and, re, radiate, that, heat, into, the, atmosphere, tyndall, proposed, that, changes, in, the, concentrations, of, these, gases, may, have, caused, climatic, changes, in, the, past, including, ice, ages, svante, arrhenius, noted, that, water, vapour, in, air, continuously, varied, but, the, co, 2, concentration, in, air, was, influenced, by, long, term, geological, processes, warming, from, increased, co, 2, levels, would, increase, the, amount, of, water, vapour, amplifying, warming, in, a, positive, feedback, loop, in, 1896, he, published, the, first, climate, model, of, its, kind, projecting, that, halving, co, 2, levels, could, have, produced, a, drop, in, temperature, initiating, an, ice, age, arrhenius, calculated, the, temperature, increase, expected, from, doubling, co, 2, to, be, around, 5, 6, c, other, scientists, were, initially, sceptical, and, believed, that, the, greenhouse, effect, was, saturated, so, that, adding, more, co, 2, would, make, no, difference, and, that, the, climate, would, be, self, regulating, beginning, in, 1938, guy, stewart, callendar, published, evidence, that, climate, was, warming, and, co, 2, levels, were, rising, but, his, calculations, met, the, same, objections, in, the, 1950s, gilbert, plass, created, a, detailed, computer, model, that, included, different, atmospheric, layers, and, the, infrared, spectrum, this, model, predicted, that, increasing, co, 2, levels, would, cause, warming, around, the, same, time, hans, suess, found, evidence, that, co, 2, levels, had, been, rising, and, roger, revelle, showed, that, the, oceans, would, not, absorb, the, increase, the, two, scientists, subsequently, helped, charles, keeling, to, begin, a, record, of, continued, increase, which, has, been, termed, the, keeling, curve, scientists, alerted, the, public, and, the, dangers, were, highlighted, at, james, hansen, s, 1988, congressional, testimony, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, set, up, in, 1988, to, provide, formal, advice, to, the, world, s, governments, spurred, interdisciplinary, research, as, part, of, the, ipcc, reports, scientists, assess, the, scientific, discussion, that, takes, place, in, peer, reviewed, journal, articles, there, is, a, near, complete, scientific, consensus, that, the, climate, is, warming, and, that, this, is, caused, by, human, activities, as, of, 2019, agreement, in, recent, literature, reached, over, 99, no, scientific, body, of, national, or, international, standing, disagrees, with, this, view, consensus, has, further, developed, that, some, form, of, action, should, be, taken, to, protect, people, against, the, impacts, of, climate, change, national, science, academies, have, called, on, world, leaders, to, cut, global, emissions, the, 2021, ipcc, assessment, report, stated, that, it, is, unequivocal, that, climate, change, is,
