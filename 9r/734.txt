climate, variability, includes, all, the, variations, in, the, climate, that, last, longer, than, individual, weather, events, whereas, the, term, climate, change, only, refers, to, those, variations, that, persist, for, a, longer, period, of, time, typically, decades, or, more, climate, change, may, refer, to, any, time, in, earth, s, history, but, the, term, is, now, commonly, used, to, describe, contemporary, climate, change, often, popularly, referred, to, as, global, warming, since, the, industrial, revolution, the, climate, has, increasingly, been, affected, by, human, activities, the, climate, system, receives, nearly, all, of, its, energy, from, the, sun, and, radiates, energy, to, outer, space, the, balance, of, incoming, and, outgoing, energy, and, the, passage, of, the, energy, through, the, climate, system, is, earth, s, energy, budget, when, the, incoming, energy, is, greater, than, the, outgoing, energy, earth, s, energy, budget, is, positive, and, the, climate, system, is, warming, if, more, energy, goes, out, the, energy, budget, is, negative, and, earth, experiences, cooling, the, energy, moving, through, earth, s, climate, system, finds, expression, in, weather, varying, on, geographic, scales, and, time, long, term, averages, and, variability, of, weather, in, a, region, constitute, the, region, s, climate, such, changes, can, be, the, result, of, internal, variability, when, natural, processes, inherent, to, the, various, parts, of, the, climate, system, alter, the, distribution, of, energy, examples, include, variability, in, ocean, basins, such, as, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, and, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, climate, variability, can, also, result, from, external, forcing, when, events, outside, of, the, climate, system, s, components, produce, changes, within, the, system, examples, include, changes, in, solar, output, and, volcanism, climate, variability, has, consequences, for, sea, level, changes, plant, life, and, mass, extinctions, it, also, affects, human, societies, climate, variability, is, the, term, to, describe, variations, in, the, mean, state, and, other, characteristics, of, climate, such, as, chances, or, possibility, of, extreme, weather, etc, on, all, spatial, and, temporal, scales, beyond, that, of, individual, weather, events, some, of, the, variability, does, not, appear, to, be, caused, by, known, systems, and, occurs, at, seemingly, random, times, such, variability, is, called, random, variability, or, noise, on, the, other, hand, periodic, variability, occurs, relatively, regularly, and, in, distinct, modes, of, variability, or, climate, patterns, the, term, climate, change, is, often, used, to, refer, specifically, to, anthropogenic, climate, change, anthropogenic, climate, change, is, caused, by, human, activity, as, opposed, to, changes, in, climate, that, may, have, resulted, as, part, of, earth, s, natural, processes, global, warming, became, the, dominant, popular, term, in, 1988, but, within, scientific, journals, global, warming, refers, to, surface, temperature, increases, while, climate, change, includes, global, warming, and, everything, else, that, increasing, greenhouse, gas, levels, affect, a, related, term, climatic, change, was, proposed, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, wmo, in, 1966, to, encompass, all, forms, of, climatic, variability, on, time, scales, longer, than, 10, years, but, regardless, of, cause, during, the, 1970s, the, term, climate, change, replaced, climatic, change, to, focus, on, anthropogenic, causes, as, it, became, clear, that, human, activities, had, a, potential, to, drastically, alter, the, climate, climate, change, was, incorporated, in, the, title, of, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, and, the, un, framework, convention, on, climate, change, unfccc, climate, change, is, now, used, as, both, a, technical, description, of, the, process, as, well, as, a, noun, used, to, describe, the, problem, on, the, broadest, scale, the, rate, at, which, energy, is, received, from, the, sun, and, the, rate, at, which, it, is, lost, to, space, determine, the, equilibrium, temperature, and, climate, of, earth, this, energy, is, distributed, around, the, globe, by, winds, ocean, currents, and, other, mechanisms, to, affect, the, climates, of, different, regions, factors, that, can, shape, climate, are, called, climate, forcings, or, forcing, mechanisms, these, include, processes, such, as, variations, in, solar, radiation, variations, in, the, earth, s, orbit, variations, in, the, albedo, or, reflectivity, of, the, continents, atmosphere, and, oceans, mountain, building, and, continental, drift, and, changes, in, greenhouse, gas, concentrations, external, forcing, can, be, either, anthropogenic, e, g, increased, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, and, dust, or, natural, e, g, changes, in, solar, output, the, earth, s, orbit, volcano, eruptions, there, are, a, variety, of, climate, change, feedbacks, that, can, either, amplify, or, diminish, the, initial, forcing, there, are, also, key, thresholds, which, when, exceeded, can, produce, rapid, or, irreversible, change, some, parts, of, the, climate, system, such, as, the, oceans, and, ice, caps, respond, more, slowly, in, reaction, to, climate, forcings, while, others, respond, more, quickly, an, example, of, fast, change, is, the, atmospheric, cooling, after, a, volcanic, eruption, when, volcanic, ash, reflects, sunlight, thermal, expansion, of, ocean, water, after, atmospheric, warming, is, slow, and, can, take, thousands, of, years, a, combination, is, also, possible, e, g, sudden, loss, of, albedo, in, the, arctic, ocean, as, sea, ice, melts, followed, by, more, gradual, thermal, expansion, of, the, water, climate, variability, can, also, occur, due, to, internal, processes, internal, unforced, processes, often, involve, changes, in, the, distribution, of, energy, in, the, ocean, and, atmosphere, for, instance, changes, in, the, thermohaline, circulation, climatic, changes, due, to, internal, variability, sometimes, occur, in, cycles, or, oscillations, for, other, types, of, natural, climatic, change, we, cannot, predict, when, it, happens, the, change, is, called, random, or, stochastic, from, a, climate, perspective, the, weather, can, be, considered, random, if, there, are, little, clouds, in, a, particular, year, there, is, an, energy, imbalance, and, extra, heat, can, be, absorbed, by, the, oceans, due, to, climate, inertia, this, signal, can, be, stored, in, the, ocean, and, be, expressed, as, variability, on, longer, time, scales, than, the, original, weather, disturbances, if, the, weather, disturbances, are, completely, random, occurring, as, white, noise, the, inertia, of, glaciers, or, oceans, can, transform, this, into, climate, changes, where, longer, duration, oscillations, are, also, larger, oscillations, a, phenomenon, called, red, noise, many, climate, changes, have, a, random, aspect, and, a, cyclical, aspect, this, behavior, is, dubbed, stochastic, resonance, half, of, the, 2021, nobel, prize, on, physics, was, awarded, for, this, work, to, klaus, hasselmann, jointly, with, syukuro, manabe, for, related, work, on, climate, modelling, while, giorgio, parisi, who, with, collaborators, introduced, the, concept, of, stochastic, resonance, was, awarded, the, other, half, but, mainly, for, work, on, theoretical, physics, the, ocean, and, atmosphere, can, work, together, to, spontaneously, generate, internal, climate, variability, that, can, persist, for, years, to, decades, at, a, time, these, variations, can, affect, global, average, surface, temperature, by, redistributing, heat, between, the, deep, ocean, and, the, atmosphere, and, or, by, altering, the, cloud, water, vapor, sea, ice, distribution, which, can, affect, the, total, energy, budget, of, the, earth, a, climate, oscillation, or, climate, cycle, is, any, recurring, cyclical, oscillation, within, global, or, regional, climate, they, are, quasiperiodic, not, perfectly, periodic, so, a, fourier, analysis, of, the, data, does, not, have, sharp, peaks, in, the, spectrum, many, oscillations, on, different, time, scales, have, been, found, or, hypothesized, the, oceanic, aspects, of, climate, variability, can, generate, variability, on, centennial, timescales, due, to, the, ocean, having, hundreds, of, times, more, mass, than, in, the, atmosphere, and, thus, very, high, thermal, inertia, for, example, alterations, to, ocean, processes, such, as, thermohaline, circulation, play, a, key, role, in, redistributing, heat, in, the, world, s, oceans, ocean, currents, transport, a, lot, of, energy, from, the, warm, tropical, regions, to, the, colder, polar, regions, changes, occurring, around, the, last, ice, age, in, technical, terms, the, last, glacial, period, show, that, the, circulation, is, the, north, atlantic, can, change, suddenly, and, substantially, leading, to, global, climate, changes, even, though, the, total, amount, of, energy, coming, into, the, climate, system, did, not, change, much, these, large, changes, may, have, come, from, so, called, heinrich, events, where, internal, instability, of, ice, sheets, caused, huge, ice, bergs, to, be, released, into, the, ocean, when, the, ice, sheet, melts, the, resulting, water, is, very, low, in, salt, and, cold, driving, changes, in, circulation, life, affects, climate, through, its, role, in, the, carbon, and, water, cycles, and, through, such, mechanisms, as, albedo, evapotranspiration, cloud, formation, and, weathering, examples, of, how, life, may, have, affected, past, climate, include, whereas, greenhouse, gases, released, by, the, biosphere, is, often, seen, as, a, feedback, or, internal, climate, process, greenhouse, gases, emitted, from, volcanoes, are, typically, classified, as, external, by, climatologists, greenhouse, gases, such, as, co, 2, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, heat, the, climate, system, by, trapping, infrared, light, volcanoes, are, also, part, of, the, extended, carbon, cycle, over, very, long, geological, time, periods, they, release, carbon, dioxide, from, the, earth, s, crust, and, mantle, counteracting, the, uptake, by, sedimentary, rocks, and, other, geological, carbon, dioxide, sinks, since, the, industrial, revolution, humanity, has, been, adding, to, greenhouse, gases, by, emitting, co, 2, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, changing, land, use, through, deforestation, and, has, further, altered, the, climate, with, aerosols, particulate, matter, in, the, atmosphere, release, of, trace, gases, e, g, nitrogen, oxides, carbon, monoxide, or, methane, other, factors, including, land, use, ozone, depletion, animal, husbandry, ruminant, animals, such, as, cattle, produce, methane, and, deforestation, also, play, a, role, the, us, geological, survey, estimates, are, that, volcanic, emissions, are, at, a, much, lower, level, than, the, effects, of, current, human, activities, which, generate, 100, 300, times, the, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, emitted, by, volcanoes, the, annual, amount, put, out, by, human, activities, may, be, greater, than, the, amount, released, by, supereruptions, the, most, recent, of, which, was, the, toba, eruption, in, indonesia, 74, 000, years, ago, slight, variations, in, earth, s, motion, lead, to, changes, in, the, seasonal, distribution, of, sunlight, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, and, how, it, is, distributed, across, the, globe, there, is, very, little, change, to, the, area, averaged, annually, averaged, sunshine, but, there, can, be, strong, changes, in, the, geographical, and, seasonal, distribution, the, three, types, of, kinematic, change, are, variations, in, earth, s, eccentricity, changes, in, the, tilt, angle, of, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, and, precession, of, earth, s, axis, combined, these, produce, milankovitch, cycles, which, affect, climate, and, are, notable, for, their, correlation, to, glacial, and, interglacial, periods, their, correlation, with, the, advance, and, retreat, of, the, sahara, and, for, their, appearance, in, the, stratigraphic, record, during, the, glacial, cycles, there, was, a, high, correlation, between, co, 2, concentrations, and, temperatures, early, studies, indicated, that, co, 2, concentrations, lagged, temperatures, but, it, has, become, clear, that, this, is, not, always, the, case, when, ocean, temperatures, increase, the, solubility, of, co, 2, decreases, so, that, it, is, released, from, the, ocean, the, exchange, of, co, 2, between, the, air, and, the, ocean, can, also, be, impacted, by, further, aspects, of, climatic, change, these, and, other, self, reinforcing, processes, allow, small, changes, in, earth, s, motion, to, have, a, large, effect, on, climate, the, sun, is, the, predominant, source, of, energy, input, to, the, earth, s, climate, system, other, sources, include, geothermal, energy, from, the, earth, s, core, tidal, energy, from, the, moon, and, heat, from, the, decay, of, radioactive, compounds, both, long, term, variations, in, solar, intensity, are, known, to, affect, global, climate, solar, output, varies, on, shorter, time, scales, including, the, 11, year, solar, cycle, and, longer, term, modulations, correlation, between, sunspots, and, climate, and, tenuous, at, best, three, to, four, billion, years, ago, the, sun, emitted, only, 75, as, much, power, as, it, does, today, if, the, atmospheric, composition, had, been, the, same, as, today, liquid, water, should, not, have, existed, on, the, earth, s, surface, however, there, is, evidence, for, the, presence, of, water, on, the, early, earth, in, the, hadean, and, archean, eons, leading, to, what, is, known, as, the, faint, young, sun, paradox, hypothesized, solutions, to, this, paradox, include, a, vastly, different, atmosphere, with, much, higher, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, than, currently, exist, over, the, following, approximately, 4, billion, years, the, energy, output, of, the, sun, increased, over, the, next, five, billion, years, the, sun, s, ultimate, death, as, it, becomes, a, red, giant, and, then, a, white, dwarf, will, have, large, effects, on, climate, with, the, red, giant, phase, possibly, ending, any, life, on, earth, that, survives, until, that, time, the, volcanic, eruptions, considered, to, be, large, enough, to, affect, the, earth, s, climate, on, a, scale, of, more, than, 1, year, are, the, ones, that, inject, over, 100, 000, tons, of, so, 2, into, the, stratosphere, this, is, due, to, the, optical, properties, of, so, 2, and, sulfate, aerosols, which, strongly, absorb, or, scatter, solar, radiation, creating, a, global, layer, of, sulfuric, acid, haze, on, average, such, eruptions, occur, several, times, per, century, and, cause, cooling, by, partially, blocking, the, transmission, of, solar, radiation, to, the, earth, s, surface, for, a, period, of, several, years, although, volcanoes, are, technically, part, of, the, lithosphere, which, itself, is, part, of, the, climate, system, the, ipcc, explicitly, defines, volcanism, as, an, external, forcing, agent, notable, eruptions, in, the, historical, records, are, the, 1991, eruption, of, mount, pinatubo, which, lowered, global, temperatures, by, about, 0, 5, c, 0, 9, f, for, up, to, three, years, and, the, 1815, eruption, of, mount, tambora, causing, the, year, without, a, summer, at, a, larger, scale, a, few, times, every, 50, million, to, 100, million, years, the, eruption, of, large, igneous, provinces, brings, large, quantities, of, igneous, rock, from, the, mantle, and, lithosphere, to, the, earth, s, surface, carbon, dioxide, in, the, rock, is, then, released, into, the, atmosphere, small, eruptions, with, injections, of, less, than, 0, 1, mt, of, sulfur, dioxide, into, the, stratosphere, affect, the, atmosphere, only, subtly, as, temperature, changes, are, comparable, with, natural, variability, however, because, smaller, eruptions, occur, at, a, much, higher, frequency, they, too, significantly, affect, earth, s, atmosphere, over, the, course, of, millions, of, years, the, motion, of, tectonic, plates, reconfigures, global, land, and, ocean, areas, and, generates, topography, this, can, affect, both, global, and, local, patterns, of, climate, and, atmosphere, ocean, circulation, the, position, of, the, continents, determines, the, geometry, of, the, oceans, and, therefore, influences, patterns, of, ocean, circulation, the, locations, of, the, seas, are, important, in, controlling, the, transfer, of, heat, and, moisture, across, the, globe, and, therefore, in, determining, global, climate, a, recent, example, of, tectonic, control, on, ocean, circulation, is, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, about, 5, million, years, ago, which, shut, off, direct, mixing, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, this, strongly, affected, the, ocean, dynamics, of, what, is, now, the, gulf, stream, and, may, have, led, to, northern, hemisphere, ice, cover, during, the, carboniferous, period, about, 300, to, 360, million, years, ago, plate, tectonics, may, have, triggered, large, scale, storage, of, carbon, and, increased, glaciation, geologic, evidence, points, to, a, megamonsoonal, circulation, pattern, during, the, time, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, and, climate, modeling, suggests, that, the, existence, of, the, supercontinent, was, conducive, to, the, establishment, of, monsoons, the, size, of, continents, is, also, important, because, of, the, stabilizing, effect, of, the, oceans, on, temperature, yearly, temperature, variations, are, generally, lower, in, coastal, areas, than, they, are, inland, a, larger, supercontinent, will, therefore, have, more, area, in, which, climate, is, strongly, seasonal, than, will, several, smaller, continents, or, islands, it, has, been, postulated, that, ionized, particles, known, as, cosmic, rays, could, impact, cloud, cover, and, thereby, the, climate, as, the, sun, shields, the, earth, from, these, particles, changes, in, solar, activity, were, hypothesized, to, influence, climate, indirectly, as, well, to, test, the, hypothesis, cern, designed, the, cloud, experiment, which, showed, the, effect, of, cosmic, rays, is, too, weak, to, influence, climate, noticeably, evidence, exists, that, the, chicxulub, asteroid, impact, some, 66, million, years, ago, had, severely, affected, the, earth, s, climate, large, quantities, of, sulfate, aerosols, were, kicked, up, into, the, atmosphere, decreasing, global, temperatures, by, up, to, 26, c, and, producing, sub, freezing, temperatures, for, a, period, of, 3, 16, years, the, recovery, time, for, this, event, took, more, than, 30, years, the, large, scale, use, of, nuclear, weapons, has, also, been, investigated, for, its, impact, on, the, climate, the, hypothesis, is, that, soot, released, by, large, scale, fires, blocks, a, significant, fraction, of, sunlight, for, as, much, as, a, year, leading, to, a, sharp, drop, in, temperatures, for, a, few, years, this, possible, event, is, described, as, nuclear, winter, humans, use, of, land, impact, how, much, sunlight, the, surface, reflects, and, the, concentration, of, dust, cloud, formation, is, not, only, influenced, by, how, much, water, is, in, the, air, and, the, temperature, but, also, by, the, amount, of, aerosols, in, the, air, such, as, dust, globally, more, dust, is, available, if, there, are, many, regions, with, dry, soils, little, vegetation, and, strong, winds, paleoclimatology, is, the, study, of, changes, in, climate, through, the, entire, history, of, earth, it, uses, a, variety, of, proxy, methods, from, the, earth, and, life, sciences, to, obtain, data, preserved, within, things, such, as, rocks, sediments, ice, sheets, tree, rings, corals, shells, and, microfossils, it, then, uses, the, records, to, determine, the, past, states, of, the, earth, s, various, climate, regions, and, its, atmospheric, system, direct, measurements, give, a, more, complete, overview, of, climate, variability, climate, changes, that, occurred, after, the, widespread, deployment, of, measuring, devices, can, be, observed, directly, reasonably, complete, global, records, of, surface, temperature, are, available, beginning, from, the, mid, late, 19th, century, further, observations, are, derived, indirectly, from, historical, documents, satellite, cloud, and, precipitation, data, has, been, available, since, the, 1970s, historical, climatology, is, the, study, of, historical, changes, in, climate, and, their, effect, on, human, history, and, development, the, primary, sources, include, written, records, such, as, sagas, chronicles, maps, and, local, history, literature, as, well, as, pictorial, representations, such, as, paintings, drawings, and, even, rock, art, climate, variability, in, the, recent, past, may, be, derived, from, changes, in, settlement, and, agricultural, patterns, archaeological, evidence, oral, history, and, historical, documents, can, offer, insights, into, past, changes, in, the, climate, changes, in, climate, have, been, linked, to, the, rise, and, the, collapse, of, various, civilizations, various, archives, of, past, climate, are, present, in, rocks, trees, and, fossils, from, these, archives, indirect, measures, of, climate, so, called, proxies, can, be, derived, quantification, of, climatological, variation, of, precipitation, in, prior, centuries, and, epochs, is, less, complete, but, approximated, using, proxies, such, as, marine, sediments, ice, cores, cave, stalagmites, and, tree, rings, stress, too, little, precipitation, or, unsuitable, temperatures, can, alter, the, growth, rate, of, trees, which, allows, scientists, to, infer, climate, trends, by, analyzing, the, growth, rate, of, tree, rings, this, branch, of, science, studying, this, called, dendroclimatology, glaciers, leave, behind, moraines, that, contain, a, wealth, of, material, including, organic, matter, quartz, and, potassium, that, may, be, dated, recording, the, periods, in, which, a, glacier, advanced, and, retreated, analysis, of, ice, in, cores, drilled, from, an, ice, sheet, such, as, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, can, be, used, to, show, a, link, between, temperature, and, global, sea, level, variations, the, air, trapped, in, bubbles, in, the, ice, can, also, reveal, the, co, 2, variations, of, the, atmosphere, from, the, distant, past, well, before, modern, environmental, influences, the, study, of, these, ice, cores, has, been, a, significant, indicator, of, the, changes, in, co, 2, over, many, millennia, and, continues, to, provide, valuable, information, about, the, differences, between, ancient, and, modern, atmospheric, conditions, the, 18, o, 16, o, ratio, in, calcite, and, ice, core, samples, used, to, deduce, ocean, temperature, in, the, distant, past, is, an, example, of, a, temperature, proxy, method, the, remnants, of, plants, and, specifically, pollen, are, also, used, to, study, climatic, change, plant, distributions, vary, under, different, climate, conditions, different, groups, of, plants, have, pollen, with, distinctive, shapes, and, surface, textures, and, since, the, outer, surface, of, pollen, is, composed, of, a, very, resilient, material, they, resist, decay, changes, in, the, type, of, pollen, found, in, different, layers, of, sediment, indicate, changes, in, plant, communities, these, changes, are, often, a, sign, of, a, changing, climate, as, an, example, pollen, studies, have, been, used, to, track, changing, vegetation, patterns, throughout, the, quaternary, glaciations, and, especially, since, the, last, glacial, maximum, remains, of, beetles, are, common, in, freshwater, and, land, sediments, different, species, of, beetles, tend, to, be, found, under, different, climatic, conditions, given, the, extensive, lineage, of, beetles, whose, genetic, makeup, has, not, altered, significantly, over, the, millennia, knowledge, of, the, present, climatic, range, of, the, different, species, and, the, age, of, the, sediments, in, which, remains, are, found, past, climatic, conditions, may, be, inferred, one, difficulty, in, detecting, climate, cycles, is, that, the, earth, s, climate, has, been, changing, in, non, cyclic, ways, over, most, paleoclimatological, timescales, currently, we, are, in, a, period, of, anthropogenic, global, warming, in, a, larger, timeframe, the, earth, is, emerging, from, the, latest, ice, age, cooling, from, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, and, warming, from, the, little, ice, age, which, means, that, climate, has, been, constantly, changing, over, the, last, 15, 000, years, or, so, during, warm, periods, temperature, fluctuations, are, often, of, a, lesser, amplitude, the, pleistocene, period, dominated, by, repeated, glaciations, developed, out, of, more, stable, conditions, in, the, miocene, and, pliocene, climate, holocene, climate, has, been, relatively, stable, all, of, these, changes, complicate, the, task, of, looking, for, cyclical, behavior, in, the, climate, positive, feedback, negative, feedback, and, ecological, inertia, from, the, land, ocean, atmosphere, system, often, attenuate, or, reverse, smaller, effects, whether, from, orbital, forcings, solar, variations, or, changes, in, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, certain, feedbacks, involving, processes, such, as, clouds, are, also, uncertain, for, contrails, natural, cirrus, clouds, oceanic, dimethyl, sulfide, and, a, land, based, equivalent, competing, theories, exist, concerning, effects, on, climatic, temperatures, for, example, contrasting, the, iris, hypothesis, and, claw, hypothesis, a, change, in, the, type, distribution, and, coverage, of, vegetation, may, occur, given, a, change, in, the, climate, some, changes, in, climate, may, result, in, increased, precipitation, and, warmth, resulting, in, improved, plant, growth, and, the, subsequent, sequestration, of, airborne, co, 2, though, an, increase, in, co, 2, may, benefit, plants, some, factors, can, diminish, this, increase, if, there, is, an, environmental, change, such, as, drought, increased, co, 2, concentrations, will, not, benefit, the, plant, so, even, though, climate, change, does, increase, co, 2, emissions, plants, will, often, not, use, this, increase, as, other, environmental, stresses, put, pressure, on, them, however, sequestration, of, co, 2, is, expected, to, affect, the, rate, of, many, natural, cycles, like, plant, litter, decomposition, rates, a, gradual, increase, in, warmth, in, a, region, will, lead, to, earlier, flowering, and, fruiting, times, driving, a, change, in, the, timing, of, life, cycles, of, dependent, organisms, conversely, cold, will, cause, plant, bio, cycles, to, lag, larger, faster, or, more, radical, changes, however, may, result, in, vegetation, stress, rapid, plant, loss, and, desertification, in, certain, circumstances, an, example, of, this, occurred, during, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, crc, an, extinction, event, 300, million, years, ago, at, this, time, vast, rainforests, covered, the, equatorial, region, of, europe, and, america, climate, change, devastated, these, tropical, rainforests, abruptly, fragmenting, the, habitat, into, isolated, islands, and, causing, the, extinction, of, many, plant, and, animal, species, one, of, the, most, important, ways, animals, can, deal, with, climatic, change, is, migration, to, warmer, or, colder, regions, on, a, longer, timescale, evolution, makes, ecosystems, including, animals, better, adapted, to, a, new, climate, rapid, or, large, climate, change, can, cause, mass, extinctions, when, creatures, are, stretched, too, far, to, be, able, to, adapt, collapses, of, past, civilizations, such, as, the, maya, may, be, related, to, cycles, of, precipitation, especially, drought, that, in, this, example, also, correlates, to, the, western, hemisphere, warm, pool, around, 70, 000, years, ago, the, toba, supervolcano, eruption, created, an, especially, cold, period, during, the, ice, age, leading, to, a, possible, genetic, bottleneck, in, human, populations, glaciers, are, considered, among, the, most, sensitive, indicators, of, a, changing, climate, their, size, is, determined, by, a, mass, balance, between, snow, input, and, melt, output, as, temperatures, increase, glaciers, retreat, unless, snow, precipitation, increases, to, make, up, for, the, additional, melt, glaciers, grow, and, shrink, due, both, to, natural, variability, and, external, forcings, variability, in, temperature, precipitation, and, hydrology, can, strongly, determine, the, evolution, of, a, glacier, in, a, particular, season, the, most, significant, climate, processes, since, the, middle, to, late, pliocene, approximately, 3, million, years, ago, are, the, glacial, and, interglacial, cycles, the, present, interglacial, period, the, holocene, has, lasted, about, 11, 700, years, shaped, by, orbital, variations, responses, such, as, the, rise, and, fall, of, continental, ice, sheets, and, significant, sea, level, changes, helped, create, the, climate, other, changes, including, heinrich, events, dansgaard, oeschger, events, and, the, younger, dryas, however, illustrate, how, glacial, variations, may, also, influence, climate, without, the, orbital, forcing, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, some, 25, 000, years, ago, sea, levels, were, roughly, 130, m, lower, than, today, the, deglaciation, afterwards, was, characterized, by, rapid, sea, level, change, in, the, early, pliocene, global, temperatures, were, 1, 2, c, warmer, than, the, present, temperature, yet, sea, level, was, 15, 25, meters, higher, than, today, sea, ice, plays, an, important, role, in, earth, s, climate, as, it, affects, the, total, amount, of, sunlight, that, is, reflected, away, from, the, earth, in, the, past, the, earth, s, oceans, have, been, almost, entirely, covered, by, sea, ice, on, a, number, of, occasions, when, the, earth, was, in, a, so, called, snowball, earth, state, and, completely, ice, free, in, periods, of, warm, climate, when, there, is, a, lot, of, sea, ice, present, globally, especially, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, climate, is, more, sensitive, to, forcings, as, the, ice, albedo, feedback, is, very, strong, various, climate, forcings, are, typically, in, flux, throughout, geologic, time, and, some, processes, of, the, earth, s, temperature, may, be, self, regulating, for, example, during, the, snowball, earth, period, large, glacial, ice, sheets, spanned, to, earth, s, equator, covering, nearly, its, entire, surface, and, very, high, albedo, created, extremely, low, temperatures, while, the, accumulation, of, snow, and, ice, likely, removed, carbon, dioxide, through, atmospheric, deposition, however, the, absence, of, plant, cover, to, absorb, atmospheric, co, 2, emitted, by, volcanoes, meant, that, the, greenhouse, gas, could, accumulate, in, the, atmosphere, there, was, also, an, absence, of, exposed, silicate, rocks, which, use, co, 2, when, they, undergo, weathering, this, created, a, warming, that, later, melted, the, ice, and, brought, earth, s, temperature, back, up, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, petm, was, a, time, period, with, more, than, 5, 8, c, global, average, temperature, rise, across, the, event, this, climate, event, occurred, at, the, time, boundary, of, the, paleocene, and, eocene, geological, epochs, during, the, event, large, amounts, of, methane, was, released, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, the, petm, represents, a, case, study, for, modern, climate, change, as, in, the, greenhouse, gases, were, released, in, a, geologically, relatively, short, amount, of, time, during, the, petm, a, mass, extinction, of, organisms, in, the, deep, ocean, took, place, throughout, the, cenozoic, multiple, climate, forcings, led, to, warming, and, cooling, of, the, atmosphere, which, led, to, the, early, formation, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, subsequent, melting, and, its, later, reglaciation, the, temperature, changes, occurred, somewhat, suddenly, at, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, of, about, 600, 760, ppm, and, temperatures, approximately, 4, c, warmer, than, today, during, the, pleistocene, cycles, of, glaciations, and, interglacials, occurred, on, cycles, of, roughly, 100, 000, years, but, may, stay, longer, within, an, interglacial, when, orbital, eccentricity, approaches, zero, as, during, the, current, interglacial, previous, interglacials, such, as, the, eemian, phase, created, temperatures, higher, than, today, higher, sea, levels, and, some, partial, melting, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, climatological, temperatures, substantially, affect, cloud, cover, and, precipitation, at, lower, temperatures, air, can, hold, less, water, vapour, which, can, lead, to, decreased, precipitation, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, of, 18, 000, years, ago, thermal, driven, evaporation, from, the, oceans, onto, continental, landmasses, was, low, causing, large, areas, of, extreme, desert, including, polar, deserts, cold, but, with, low, rates, of, cloud, cover, and, precipitation, in, contrast, the, world, s, climate, was, cloudier, and, wetter, than, today, near, the, start, of, the, warm, atlantic, period, of, 8000, years, ago, the, holocene, is, characterized, by, a, long, term, cooling, starting, after, the, holocene, optimum, when, temperatures, were, probably, only, just, below, current, temperatures, second, decade, of, the, 21st, century, and, a, strong, african, monsoon, created, grassland, conditions, in, the, sahara, during, the, neolithic, subpluvial, since, that, time, several, cooling, events, have, occurred, including, in, contrast, several, warm, periods, have, also, taken, place, and, they, include, but, are, not, limited, to, certain, effects, have, occurred, during, these, cycles, for, example, during, the, medieval, warm, period, the, american, midwest, was, in, drought, including, the, sand, hills, of, nebraska, which, were, active, sand, dunes, the, black, death, plague, of, yersinia, pestis, also, occurred, during, medieval, temperature, fluctuations, and, may, be, related, to, changing, climates, solar, activity, may, have, contributed, to, part, of, the, modern, warming, that, peaked, in, the, 1930s, however, solar, cycles, fail, to, account, for, warming, observed, since, the, 1980s, to, the, present, day, events, such, as, the, opening, of, the, northwest, passage, and, recent, record, low, ice, minima, of, the, modern, arctic, shrinkage, have, not, taken, place, for, at, least, several, centuries, as, early, explorers, were, all, unable, to, make, an, arctic, crossing, even, in, summer, shifts, in, biomes, and, habitat, ranges, are, also, unprecedented, occurring, at, rates, that, do, not, coincide, with, known, climate, oscillations, as, a, consequence, of, humans, emitting, greenhouse, gases, global, surface, temperatures, have, started, rising, global, warming, is, an, aspect, of, modern, climate, change, a, term, that, also, includes, the, observed, changes, in, precipitation, storm, tracks, and, cloudiness, as, a, consequence, glaciers, worldwide, have, been, found, to, be, shrinking, significantly, land, ice, sheets, in, both, antarctica, and, greenland, have, been, losing, mass, since, 2002, and, have, seen, an, acceleration, of, ice, mass, loss, since, 2009, global, sea, levels, have, been, rising, as, a, consequence, of, thermal, expansion, and, ice, melt, the, decline, in, arctic, sea, ice, both, in, extent, and, thickness, over, the, last, several, decades, is, further, evidence, for, rapid, climate, change, in, addition, to, global, climate, variability, and, global, climate, change, over, time, numerous, climatic, variations, occur, contemporaneously, across, different, physical, regions, the, oceans, absorption, of, about, 90, of, excess, heat, has, helped, to, cause, land, surface, temperatures, to, grow, more, rapidly, than, sea, surface, temperatures, the, northern, hemisphere, having, a, larger, landmass, to, ocean, ratio, than, the, southern, hemisphere, shows, greater, average, temperature, increases, variations, across, different, latitude, bands, also, reflect, this, divergence, in, average, temperature, increase, with, the, temperature, increase, of, northern, extratropics, exceeding, that, of, the, tropics, which, in, turn, exceeds, that, of, the, southern, extratropics, upper, regions, of, the, atmosphere, have, been, cooling, contemporaneously, with, a, warming, in, the, lower, atmosphere, confirming, the, action, of, the, greenhouse, effect, and, ozone, depletion, observed, regional, climatic, variations, confirm, predictions, concerning, ongoing, changes, for, example, by, contrasting, smoother, year, to, year, global, variations, with, more, volatile, year, to, year, variations, in, localized, regions, conversely, comparing, different, regions, warming, patterns, to, their, respective, historical, variabilities, allows, the, raw, magnitudes, of, temperature, changes, to, be, placed, in, the, perspective, of, what, is, normal, variability, for, each, region, regional, variability, observations, permit, study, of, regionalized, climate, tipping, points, such, as, rainforest, loss, ice, sheet, and, sea, ice, melt, and, permafrost, thawing, such, distinctions, underlie, research, into, a, possible, global, cascade, of, tipping, points
